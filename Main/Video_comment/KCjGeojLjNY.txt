real madrid players are cocky just beacuse you were able to finnish straight after the whistle does not mean it's a goal. nothing counts after final whistle. tbh the ref could have waited to let play finnish but im guessing the time was well over
This best Conversation for me
The ref blows the whistle when he sees the player going for a cross it is rigged you let that cross happen
Wtf was the point of the corner kick then, what u expect? 😑
If you can't score after a the match then you can't get sent off
The ref should be fired he might give red card to Jude for no reason Edit the reason was protesting but that’s not a red card
Real Madrid crying they can't buy refs anymore
Barca are back baby!!!
Hmmmmmmm tbh not a big deal
I referee, and I always tell players as soon as the ball leaves the box, the game is over if in a situation like that. Referee was quite right to blow the whistle. If he waits for the attack to be over, that could have been another minute or two. Goe to blow at sometime.
As if the ref is going to change his mind
Jobsworth!!👏👏👏🤣
Ha ha, couldn't happen to a nicer team.
All this talk of “7 minutes added” is an irrelevant point. The rule of added time is a “minimum”. It isn’t 7 minutes exactly added, it’s a MINIMUM of 7 minutes added. I can’t stand Real Madrid but this ref let a new phase start so should have let it finish before he blew his whistle. To blow at a cross is moronic
That is some seriously dodgy refereeing, not to defend real madrid, but that is poor, and I can understand the frustration.
What are they asking the referee to do? Award the goal after the whistle was blown?
Bellingham has the temper of Zidane too. 😂
Any idea why Bellingham got sent off rather than any other player giving him grief?
ive always said if the ball is still in play in the opositions half it shouldnt be blown unless nothing is happening
How old are these guys? We are taught at the age of five. The referee's decision is final......
The problem is with the fact that the whistle was played when an attack was going on
Absolutely ridiculous decision to give Bellingham a red card, for what? Being rightfully upset that he's been screwed out of a goal-winner?
He blew the whistle just as the cross was being played. Ref did nothing wrong whatsoever. Sour grapes from RM fans 😂
Fantastic drama!
That is not where you blow the whistle regardless! On a cross.. This should have come prior to the corner kick as there no point keeping the game in play on an attack for what seems just a couple of seconds. Referees are getting more and more ridiculous with these decisions. I suppose it’s with the prominence of VAR they feel inclined to make their own decision. That is a goal. Red card stands though. Genius.
You cannot keep on playing until one team scores. How about the other side of the coin? Referee allows goal to stand and Valencia lose.
Revar talking about refs is like complaining the water is too wet
Oldest adage in football " play to the whistle"
Imagine if people had a bet on Madrid to win lol
Shouldn't have given the corner if there was so little time
Wierd red cards can occur after the final whistle lmao
The speed of sound is faster than a cross.  Now you know.
Horrible team!! Entitled dirty bunch!
Badly timed whistle but the response from Madrid players and was embarrassing.
Of course jude scored. The defence stopped playing as the whistle had gone
Bellingham is really starting to lose his head. On one hand he's facing a potential 10 game ban for what he said to Greenwood (rightfully, but gotta stay professional), and now he's got a straight red for gobbing off. Lad needs to rein it in. Becoming too much like Vini Jr.
Lol ref ruins all games now
L commentator
Easy to solve: transparency in timekeeping ⏱️
Refs always wait for a lull to blow the whistle,  I think this a bit out of order, but technically the ref's in his rights to blow when a goal-bound shot is in mid-flight!
I have a bias towards Bellingham (fellow Englishman and all that 😎), but the ref was right to rule the goal out. He blew the whistle before the cross.
In Real's defence, the goal was scored whilst the whistle was being blowed. Goal Should have stood.
This is why nobody watches this shit expect Americans lol it's fixed in Spain
Couldn't happen to a nicer club
Real not getting exactly what they want out of the refs? Now I've seen everything
HAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAA!!!  TOUGH SHIT ON STINKIN REAL!!!  THAT IS SOOOOOO FUNNY!!!  HAHAHAAAAAAAA!!!!!   😂😂
He should've blown it a moment or two earlier once the corner had been defended already, but ultimately it was the right decision.
Modern day footballers behave like spoilt little brats I love Bellingham and as an English man I want him to do well Especially whilst playing for england But he can be very petulant  Which is not good to see
Awful referee 😂🤦‍♂️
Nice to see spanish league has clowns the same as prem
Literally no issues here. Ref played the rules and the players are just sour
Why the hype? The games can be finished at any stage of play, the only exception being for the taking of a penalty.
Wtf is the ref doing? Let him cross it or blow as soon as the ball went outside the box after rhw corners cleared
Whats the controversy? That was a long time between the final whistle and the goal, just because you ignore it doesn't mean you're right
Correct decision. Time was up and the ref blew before the cross. This is a non issue only made into an issue by entitled Madrid "fans" who cannot accept anything going against them.  The biggest shame is that Jude is starting to inherit the petulance and arrogance that everyone has when they have been at madrid for a while.
Just more examples of absolutely spoilt brats throwing toys out of pram and thinking they above the rules, waving hands, screaming at the referee, THE WHISTLE HAD BLOWN GAME OVER NO DEBATE HERE, GET OVER IT AND GROW UP
Ref is allowed to blow whenever he decides but it's very poor timing to blow mid-air as cross comes into the box. Ref caused a ridiculous situation, commentary doesn't seem to understand.
Correct decision, Madrid need to just suck it up and stop acting like the victim
REFEREES NOWADAYS.🙄.
Real madrid are so entitled they think if they play on the game continues
Problem here is Ref allowed the play to continue after Valencia defended the corner and as Madrid is about to create a chance for goal he blows the whistle.   Reminds me of Halaand recently doing a counter possibly 1 on 1 with GK and ref then blows his whilst for an infringement earlier after he allowed City to play advantage.  Halaand getting cancelled of a potential goal.. Bellingham getting cancelled of a potential goal.. Not a coincidence!
Bellinghams such a donny
The ref blew the whistle before the cross was made. The Valencia players were switched off. Madrid can't claim they had a goal disallowed.
Goal doesn’t count neither should the red card stand  You simply cannot have the cake and eat it these officials are mugging it
Poor decision by the Ref. The ball is airborne, there's a possibility that Real Madrid would score. Let that passage of play end, then blow your whistle. Unbelievable refereeing.
The ref blew his whistle..typical real Madrid crying like bitches 😂
WTF how the hell could the ref do this the ball was still very much alive and in Madrid's control he should never have blown the whistle until the ball was out of Madrid's control. Never have I seen this in all the  decades I've watched the beautiful game.
School playground and unprofessional. Bring on the fine.
Brazil vs Sweden 1978 world cup...The ref Clive Thomas blew the whistle as a Brazil corner came over. Brazil scored from the corner..Thomas never  did an international game again. TBH he was an idiot.
Cannit beleive pwople think it was unfair, what game were you lot watching? There was enough time after the corner, the game doesnt stop on a goal, its stops when time is up...
The look on Bellinghams face, priceless 😂😂
It's all about the money in Spanish la liga
Clearly blows. Whats the issue
Nothing wrong at all. Madrid player ran away from goal and to the side of the pitch. Defender was holding him off so ref blew for full time. He then played the ball after the final whistle had gone, Bellingham didn't have to even head the ball.
What was the referee playing at. If it was that close to the end why not blow when the corner was given. He caused the scene. If you let the corner happen you wait until its cleared.
Barcelona are still paying off the referees I see.
the ref is a moron
The ref is in the right 😂 for once
7mins added. They were 8+mins in. Well done ref 🫡
cant even see what jude did to get a red wtf?
Pussies
Red card after the game has finished. No goal no red card?
He blows well before the cross comes in I don’t see what the issue is 😂😂
The ref should be banned for life
Rigged
Ref : "The Odds Boost for a draw was too good ".
How can madrid complain?! 😂 the whistle went, simple
If i remember correctly something like this happened to David Platt whistle blew while his shot was in the air
Commentators wrong.  The whistle blew as ball got played.
Yet you can give a red card,even tho the match has finished but goal wasn’t allowed fucking ridiculous
Why didnt he blow the whistle when the ball was cleared??
Why did the referee allow the corner to be taken if he was going to blow. Time was already up. Just made it worse for himself
When the time's up, your time is up.
Ha! Why is everyone a qeapom these days. Yes including you
Hah, that's what madrid gets for robbing almeria.
2nd phase of play as soon as the corner was over. Ref was well within his right to blow. Get over it
Ref waited for the ball to leave the box before blowing his whistle... You can cry about it but it's clear to see. If Jude hadn't scored, you would've heard the commentators saying "it wouldn't have counted anyway"...
If you play it back, the ref blows as he kicks it, not before.
Idiot ref - why put yourself in this position is beyond me.
Refs on barcas payroll
I'm in the UK and this is unbelievable. The ball was being played into the box so the referee shouldn't be blowing the whistle.
How come the red card stands but the goal is not😂
Play to the whistle you are told as a boy.
What’s the refs name? He shouldn’t officiate any matches
Commentator is a retard. Ref doesn’t blow when he said he did
The ref whistled before the cross come over
What's the problem there .  Blew up before ball was crossed . Simple ..happens year In year out .
The referee blew his whistle, the game has ended and now Madrid want to bully the referee.
fixed game
Brilliant ref
This ref should move to Scotland. He'd fit right in
Completely fair decision. You don’t get additional time just because a cross is about to go into the box.
I actually don't think is controversial at all
Another one of football rules that's always up in the air . Need to stop the clock during delays then the ref can blow on exactly 90
The ref can blow the final whistle within the appropriate time whenever he sees fit. He is in charge of the game not the Real Madrid players, staff and supporters.
hahahaha
Play to the whistle it’s simple
Ha ha ha
THIS IS NIT HOW IT WORKS the manager just came up with his own rules he CANNOT blow the whistle in the middle of the atack unecceptable😮     Edit: madrid haters are taking over the chat 😂
nothing to see here, he ends the game before the header. Bad luck for my team though.... 😥
The ref blew this whistle I don’t get where the injustice is…. So he ain’t allowed to blow for full time coz Madrid hadn’t scored yet. This is nonsense
Nothing wrong, whistle blew
How r people so thick it’s actually and incredibly good decision from the ref
There will most likely be someone out there who would of won an accumulator if that goal would of stood yesterday so think how FURIOUS they must of been with the late goal not counting!!  Equally I can only imagine someone else MUST of needed the game to finish all square so they were probably counting their lucky stars!!
The goal was scored after the final whistle. But the rule should be changed so that it can only be blown once the ball goes out of play. Saves all these ugly scenes happening at the end of the game.
The ref bet both teams to scored and draw, thats it
You love to see
I don't really see anything weird. The regular time has ended, Madrid is about to start a new chance by crossing and the whistle comes when Brahim touches the ball, the ball is not in the air yet. Correct whistle to my opinion
Everyone complaining but the ref clearly blew the whistle before the cross came in
The whistle had gone so suck it up .
Mental. Blatant match fixing or just negligence? 😂
Bellingham is a thick yob, red card fully deserved. Lived in Spain for months now can't speak a single word of the language, lived in Germany for years couldn't speak a single word of German. Dumbass.🙄
The refs was influenced by a player shouting at him to blow the whistle. Personally I don’t think referees should blow for time if a team is in control of the ball in the oppositions final third
The whistle went, what are they moaning about, hea nearly finished the third blow by the time it goes in
This is why no one likes Madrid, cant handle a decision against them and cry like little girls but they usually get all the refs.
This also happened in a 1974 world cup match (Brazil vs Sweden) with Clive Thomas the Welsh referee. Utter nievity. He blew the whistle when the ball in the air from a corner!
I genuinely don’t see the outrage here. 1.40 over the allotted time and ref bluw once the ball was cleared from the corner
Don't blow the whistle when the ball is being crossed, so dumb.
Nice to finally see Real Madrid on the wrong side of a contentious decision
Shocking from the Ref, very poor.
He blew the whistle way before the cross. Real just being real
I heard the whistle before the header  so cannot complain
This wouldn’t have happened at the Liverpool game yesterday
That referee will be fired from LALIGA definitely!
It was the correct outcome!!!!! Whistle went and it was already minute and half over
How can you blow the full time whistle if there's a team still on the  attack refs a cheat
i don't get the frustration here. the whistle went before the ball was crossed in. I dont understand why they are annoyed
It's Real Madrid. They have gotten used to the ref helping them all season, so expected another helping hand. It's almost 2 minutes over the additonal 7 and the ref blows up once the player goes wide, he even hesitated as there could have been a shot, once he goes wide, game over. Typical Madrid. You can also see the Valencia players hear the whistle and stop defending.
Corruption
The ref brought the whistle to his mouth and dropped it again just before the cross
Unfortunate, but when the whistle is blown, stop playing.
He had to blow the whistle at some point. To wait till Madrid completed their attack would’ve been even worse.   You can clearly hear the whistle go before the ball was crossed as the commentators say. In addition, some Valencia players stopped playing on hearing the whistle.   Great refereeing.
If it was liverpool they would of got  an extra half to try get the winner
People saying that it was past the 7 min extra time, clearly didn't watch the game. 2-3 min were wasted due to VAR check, so it should have been 99-100min in the game. Doesn't matter what team do you support, it's corruption. Real, Almeria or Barca, or Premier League football. It's corrupt. Wake up people. There are billions in the betting, you think they care about a club losing 2-3 points?
Rule one in football ! Play till the whistle is blown 😂 Well it was blown way before the goal went in
The referee can not just blow the whistle whilst Real Madrid have possession and almost all the players are in the box. Even a Valencia player Hugo Duro said after the match the the referee should not blow for full time in such a position. Real were  robbed of 3 points. Besides, if he can’t allow the goal because it went on after full time, then what makes him able to hand out red cards to the players??
Real gets 50 decisions per season for them they don’t complain
The ref  did the right thing ,  on his watch , time was up & he blew the whistle,  you cannot keep on playing for a team  to score & then blow
Ref had some €€ on it
Has to be one of the worst calls this year
Hahaha could not happen to a better team fuk Madrid cheating bastards 🤣 😂 🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿
I remember Real Madrid fans making all kinds of excuses for the Napoli decision, now they can’t make up their mind on refereeing, they are like the arsenal of Spain with their fan base
Times up...how much time do you want?
Ref carefully watched the time and blew the moment the game was over, no problem here 👍
Referee blows to late in my opinion as the corner was the last kick of the game .anyway that’s football ⚽️ gotta love it
Blowing the whistle then looks very suspect
Ref blown  No goal  Real madrid rest  Respect the referee decision
I always got taught as a kid to play to the whistle! Real Madrid were 2 nil down be glad of the point better than none at all
Real thinking they can have things as they want and ref to let them play till they score
Only thing wrong here is the players reaction. Ref blew way before the cross, shouldn’t have crossed the ball really, play stops when the whistle goes.
Madrid disgraceful
The ref only blew because a Valencia player told him to, that's the worst part
Genuinely what  Bellingham gets
Typical over paid entitled football players. The referee blew for full-time before the ball was crossed over.
Tbf he did blow it before the cross came in
Don’t see any problem. Whistle blows, end of match.
This sums up modern football. The players are ill disciplined, and act disgarcefully, because the Managers are also a disgrace, the way that the behave also. The likes of Graham Taylor, or Brian Clough would never had their players acting the way they do now, because they did not allow it.
Iv never Hurd anything so ridiculous that the referee isn’t abliged to let the game continue. Well yes he is he has to let the attack play out if surely
Your supposed to see out the play in situations like that
The whistle was obvious to us. It went before the cross went in. Fair enough, it may have been hard for the players to have heard above the noise in the stadium, but they can't argue.  I have seen games where the ref has blown as a corner has come in.  The ref could have saved all that though, by just blowing when the ball went outside the 18yd box.
Bellingham: abuses referee  Referee gives red card  Bellingham: Surprise pikachu face
I needed to blow as soon as the ball Left the box. It was like he waited and saw there would be another chance and then blew
literaly ref whistles when he see that the guy is up to give that long pass into the box....UNBELIEVABLE moments we live in the football!!!!!!!
Time added 7min game ended 99 I see no problem
The ref has got balls of steel 😂
This beats any fuq up I've ever seen in the Premier league this now makes our refs godly 😂
Ref wanted more euros but Madrid wouldn’t pay . 😢
Love to see Madrid not get a decision they’re way for once
Ref blows before the cross, its clear - They all heard it. Usual Real arrogance that the rules don't apply to us and the ref should play on until they score.
Nothing wrong with that decision, ref could finish the game at any given time, it was after added time and corner kick has been executed, they had 90 min to win a game!!!
Yeh he probably should of let play run, but you can clearly hear him blow way before the cross.  Being taken way out of proportion....
Play to the whistle.....
Correct decision
Correct decision
😂😂😂😂, 💩 falangist club real Madrid 😂😂😂😂  cry more ya 🤡🤡
Should it be the end of the final whistle as the ball was in the back of the net before the referee made the final sound.
Grow up Ffs, they had 90mins to score. Accept the decision
When the time is up, it’s up!
this reminds me of FC24 refs !😡
This ref should be banned for this. Absolutely terrible refereeing
Fraud
F***k off ref that's the middle of the match
Walking dead
But...but...but.... didn't Arteta say it was only English refs that did things wrong.....refs from other countries NEVER make mistakes do they........ 🤡🤦‍♂️
Injustice !!!😢😢
Ref should be fined and sacked
He blew the whistle before the goal went it as we saw so yea no goal.
Not like a ref to make it all about themselves and spoil the game is it...
he blew, get over it you crybabies
if it was clear, why were the Valencia players still defending?
What other reaction do you expect, when your so used to getting what you want.....
He blows his whistle before the guy even crosses the ball what are people crying about haha
Same ref that gave Valencia 3 penalties against Real Madrid the last time he refereed this game. Hopefully this shambolic display sees his top-level career come to an end. Blew the final whistle in an attacking phase with the ball in the air and did so a whole minute before injury time should have ended after the penalty hold up. Absolute daylight robbery!
Sad to say, but a ref will cause a riot one day
Nothing to see here. Whistle was blown before the cross.
Players crying like big babies 🤦‍♂️. always the same with the top Spanish clubs
Im really suprised at how the commentators are completely on side with the referees decision. In all my time watchig never seen a referee blow on an attack that so high up in progression against the defensive side.
Don't see what the issue is here!, Ref clearly ends the game before he scores. Sour grapes!
Aww cheat madrid get a taste of their own medicine
Poor Jude, from scoring the winner to a no goal and a red card in the space of 10 seconds 😞
Ref should have given more reds. The ref was in the right
Don't see what the ref has done wrong.
nah bruh jees
Footballers are wan$ers. Grow up, and accept the ref's desicion.
Phew, the referee nearly allowed another goal there VAR and refs removing this blight on the game
Not only that the ref was giving red cards after the game ended 😂😂😂
Stop crying ladies, the refs always play real Madrid’s side, once they don’t do people cry😂😂😂😂
I thought the refs are bad in England this is shocking
My only problem is the ref blew the whistle when the ball was in mid air. He should of blew the whistle when corner had been successfully defended.
I bet that referee... Forget about it, I just bet
Aww boo fucking hoo
Great referee, the game was done.
Finally, a ref who's not on their books 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂👍👍
Love the smirk on Hugo Duro's face at the final whistle. He knows what's coming, but doesn't care to be anywhere near it 🤣
Spainish LALIGA = fixed joke full of gambling addicts , clearly looked like ref had a big wager for a draw .  couldn't care less about either team but this is a clear fix and spainsh football famous for fixing, they literally have match odds during the game on spainish tv. spain FA should check refs computer , also commentator is corrupt being unprofessional and bias af, lol like at 2:04 how does he know in the replay when the ref blown when there's no sound. tl;dr gambling addicts destroying the game, spain should be ashamed how farcical their league is
They made someone to lose their bet😂😂
Woke commentary "player of the match" 🤡
Stop your whining
It's good to see a referee finally stand up to Madrid.
This ref should be fined and replay the match with a proper referee. He ended first half early and the match early too. He ruined the match full on with those decisions. You cannot blow the whistle when there is a goal scoring opportunity or if the attacking team wins a corner. Especially as in the 90+ minutes, you had VAR waste around 2 minutes of the added time.
If the keeper jumped to save the ball it should be a goal end of discussion that ref is a punk.
Fair play to the ref. Made a choice and stood by it. No reason why the goal should stand, the alloted time had been played
Why is that son of bitch shitnicius acting hard
What should of happened forest Vs Liverpool
99th minute with 7+ added time. He gave Madrid a direct corner and that was it. What’s the issue 😂
I understand why the players are mad because they’re still on the attack in the same area of the pitch directly from the corner so it’s kind of bs. You can’t even say that everyone stopped moving because a lot of them didn’t hear the whistle and continued playing. It’s 50/50
Vardrid getting a taste of their own medicine🤌
He blew the whistle afew before it reached Bellingham! Should take points off them for being so entitled
Find it very strange how the only person to get a red there was Bellingham, even though many players surrounded the ref and looked more aggressive than he did
You can't blow this whistle in rje middle of an goal attacking action! Never happens in UK! Ridiculous! That's why players get angry, its natural! Ref should jave blown during throw in, or went ball wemt out fr corner! Dingbat!😮
To be fair the ref was not in the wrong here. He added on 7 minutes and he added an extra minute. The game was already over and he blow before the cross came in.
Waww😮😮😮😮😮 how can we see those things 😮 waww 😮
I think referees should do interviews after the game too. It’d be interesting to know why they have made stupid/great decisions. What do you guy think?
Racist cyant hahahaha
Ref- I ain't greedy for Madrid money.
i think we all need to wait for FC morality and high horse aka everton fans to cast their judgement on this before we draw any conclusions.  or is it only liverpool games they forensically analyse and foam over?  boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
Why did the ref blow the whistle after the Valencia player pressured him?
Already a minute over the end of added time, what are they complaining about? The fact the ref didn’t take the bribe for once?
Blame the deaf fool who croassed in the ball then cried and waved his arms about like a school girl.
Soon as the ball is headed out from the corner. The whistle goes for me. We have no problem and they shake hands.
Bad ref he blew it just as he crossed the ball
he lets them take the corner waits for the ball to leave the box and the phase of the attack to finish and then blows - looks awkward because the ball is immediately lumped back into the box but Madrid had 99 minutes to score more than Valencia and the didn't - the rule isn't play until Madrid score.
The worst refereeing decision I've ever seen. An absolute daylight robbery. This is what happens when you have integrity and don't back Tebas. Fuck this referee and fuck Valencia
It seems jude Bellingham likes to talk alot😅 He just got himself a red card
That's insane but why is the linesman and the Valencia players still playing like 5 seconds after ref apparently blow the whistle
Ref: "imma get my bet win tonight. IDGAF *blows final whistle* "
What's dodgy is the ref decided not to blow the whistle when the ball was cleared but after Diaz crossed it into the box and it was midair. Madrid were robbed there 😂  The commentator straight up lied as well and said the ref blew the whistle before the ball was crossed in.
🤣🤣🤣
According to Vini Jr the decision was racist ..........................
Watch the referee throughout... Blatent robbery
This has got to be the most blatent piece of robbery and corruption in professional football
Keep playing til the final whistle or if your Real Madrid just keep playing anyway 😂
poor refereeing.  let the corner finish before ending the game. Even liverpools game had a shyte referee.
Ref did blow his whistle before Brahim even crossed it in tbf. But should’ve blown once the initial corner was cleared  Just to save his own back
The ref couldn't wait to pull out the card as soon as he saw it was Bellingham, could he.
Real madrid players are insufferable
The ref should have blown when the first clearance happened. Doing it when he did is why they went mad. But they should have accepted it. It has to be disappointing, but if it was the other way, they wouldn't complain. Jude getting a red card as well.... silly that. He needs to learn how to keep his cool. Spanish referees are good but very easy to offend. They love throwing cards about.
Embarassing display by the ref. Hope he never officiates a game ever again in his life.
Whistle blew whem time is up. Of it aomt in the net before tough luck. It blew before the cross was kicked. Thats time, thats football, thats life.
The whistle went as the cross went in ...simple as , no goal
The ref had a hand on the red card in his pocket😂 Ready and Waiting
Play to the whistle.
The referee thought the ball was going out thts why he blew
The referee’s on crack. 😂 You do not blow the whistle when the attack is currently in a phase. He should’ve blown it after the corner was defended. Why blow it when they’re about to cross it in?
Often the unspoken rule with referees is, wait until the ball goes dead. Or wait until the defending team clears the ball past the halfway line.   I think there should be an allowance for a final phase of play to continue and be resolved before blowing the whistle.
Should a rule be implemented stating that the final whistle can only be blown when the ball is out of play/play has stopped ?
if you pause and see the video, clearly the ref blows his whistle before Brahim hits the ball(his right leg is in the air before he crosses),  its a 3 part whistle, the second one is when the ball is in the air and the third finishes after the goal is scored. Once he blows his first whistle he cant magically stop time, why are you guys complaining?
I see no evil. For example in basketball throw must be done before whistle but points count even when ball gets in after, here the header was performed after the whistle. Finito.
The goal should of stood because it was in on the 3rd whistle. Whats the point in blowing 3 times besides us knowing its over. Then blow once. As a LFC Fan that's what could happen to us today. Nunez scored in the 99th😊 minute.
You can’t play til there is a dead ball and you can’t give a red card after the whistle is blown not even a real madrid fan but this is the worst officiating i’ve ever seen
As a neutral in all this you all are crying for no reason. The ref didn't do anything wrong.
The commentator is as stupid as the referee
Why blow the whistle when they was clearly still attacking? Should have been a goal refs are wank
lol he was about to blow then didn’t then seen they was going to score and blew like wtaf 👀😂
Play the video on 0.25 speed and listen to the corner being taken.  This footage has been RIGGED!!!
This video has even been doctored to make it appear less like a mistake. Listen to the sound of the ball being kicked slightly before Modric takes the corner!  And those saying it was already over the 7 mis additional time obviously don't have all the facts, because the 7 mins injury time included a lengthy VAR check which should always result in additional additional time being played.
thats what they deserve. they keep having the refs in their pockets and now this ref has madrid in his pocket.
Harsh but the whistle did go before the ball was in the net
ref clearly whistled when ball was in corner. so Madrid should have no complaints. Bellingham most likely only scored because valencia players heard the whistle and half switched off.
Thanks ref, lost £400 because of this.
All the white Real Madrid players screaming at the ref got no card, Bellingham runs in there and screams like everyone else, ref immediately pulls out red card. lol. Okay.
You should never blow the whistle, until it's clearly out of play and the ref definitely blew the whistle too early. There's former referees that have regretted doing it in the past, but this guy won't care. That goal would have put Jude, one step closer to the golden boot hunt and 2 points closer to the title. But, they're Real Madrid and they'll get past this. Shame for Jude though, missed three games to injury and now he's missing another three games because of a straight red, that could have been avoidable. So, we won't see Jude for in la liga until the middle of April now. 6 weeks and that will cost him the golden boot surely now
😂😂😂the whistle got blown before the cross when time wss up fair to me
I didn’t know you could give red cards or yellow cards after the match has ended
Most of the time the whistle gets blown at the centre of the pitch not when a goal is about to be scored
That moment today happened to Liverpool vs Nottingham Forest but Referee didn’t blow the whistle. He let the corner and last shot be played. Here with Real Madrid is very unfair.
Classic grey area… refs rarely blow the whistle during mid play of final last second attack. But the rule is minimum of (in this case) 7 mins and they played 8 plus minutes.
Play until the whistle. When the whistle goes why are people complaining after-play is voided?
CRY MORE MADRID SCUM HAHAHAHAHA
Its not a goal
The whistle was blown, deal with it.
Seems fairly simple to me. There’s a point in time at which the game ends , and that point in play is when the time runs out. Anything that happens before that is part of the game. Anything that happens after that is not part of the game. The way this is indicated is by the referee blowing the whistle. I hope that explains things for everyone. I believe that I have cleared things up now.
loved it
Ref should be investigated wouldn't be shocked if some money went into his pocket for this what ref blows whistle during a live attack when its in the box already, supposed to wait until attack is over or away from box completely to end match, but since jude scored that would have been end of attack very dodgy I get why Real Madrid not happy with such blatant robbery of goal
Red card shouldnt count as it was given after the game had finished hahahah stupid ref
Fucking Real Madrid cry babies
Ball in the air when the whistle goes. The Liverpool Forest game was a shambles too. I need to look into cricket.
Never ever ever see this in Rugby. Football sucks so bad!!!
He whistled before they crossed it. Madrid get all the decisions in their favour in general.
Real think they can do what they what they want
That's such bullshit surely the ball must be away from goal for the whistle to be blown I'd gone mad
There's no issue. He starts blowing the whistle as the crosser kicks the ball.
Amazing how easy players score when they know the whistle has gone and there's no pressure, see it all the time with offsides, but in the real pressure cooker they fluff 9 out of 10 sitters.
The refs a Barcelona fan I know him personally..
The whistle went before they crossed the ball so the game should be stopped
Football is becoming a circus.
It wasn't even 90mins it was 89:49 as he's blown the final whistle
Garth lies to the police and gets them to total me illegally help total me brakeing a court law stalking me again totaks ne again nhs abuse try to heavy drug me dr b dan daved mangers frames me again on total 3 police lie and brake my leg with him agresive police women from shakling with afro all planed to lie to rob win black and white devils dan with jamie afro nhs police courts iow illegally moveing me around in connection with uk blacks in nhs and police block rob camp iow uk devil gov and their devil people white people are one with the devils system of health care and law counsil full time destroyer they are all death I feel like I grow up in gaza not as bad but a full time machine of destroying my life white people move like the devil him self they are one with the devil system of law nhs counsil iow devils dan the screen devil witchs all that
Why are people making a mountain out of a mole hill.
Disgusting cheat
But when it’s Liverpool you don’t have to blow the whistle
I'm a Barcelona fan but I've never seen that.
The ref blew the whistle just after the player crossed the ball. It's not a debate. You can go slow motion and see and hear it. Simple.
It was well over the extra time, it had to ended at some point. And the whistle was blown enough in advance before the goal. Is the Ref supposed to never stop it, if one of the teams keeps on attacking???😂 with Real's players it means the game would never stop then. Also, for once it's Real being penalised and not a small team... we have seen horrendous things in CL in the past decades with Real
Crazy
Who cares about this farmers league
most of the Valencians had stopped playing
He definitely blew his whistle…but WHY would you blow there? 99.9999% of the time, you let the attack play out
Well, Bellingham moved to Madrid so he could be the number one guy and now everyone's talking about him 😂😂
I've said to myself for a long time that the refs shoulnd blow the half of full time whistle until the ball is in the neutral final third of the pitch 🤷
I would love to see Girona win the league, but if there is one thing that annoys me it is when the referee begins to blow the whistle when the player is on the edge of the side of the penalty area and the ball has just left his foot to cross the ball! Its just poor referreeing. Just wait until the chance has gone before doing that, bo wonder the Real Madrid players were livid.
100% Gole 2:3
hold vardrid hahahaha
madrid used to their bribes ensuring everything goes way. good to see some justice
How are the commentators saying it’s the ref that made the right decision are u stupid
Ppl forgetting he has to make his mind up to blow.. And then blow. He obv made his mind up when he ran towards the corner and then blew, unfortunately when another cross came in...
There's a lot of injustice in football, but this isn't an example of it
Referee just fucked up all my accas! Thanks you c#nt!!!
Did you even watch the game guys? Was a 6 min stoppage time because of injured player and also many fouls during the second half and even in the extra time. So lets say 7 min extra time is okey but  you telling me that he cant leave the attack when he put the whistle in the mouth before the cross, put his hand down again and then at the next moment when Brahim hits the ball, he put the whistle and blows the 1st, then the 2nd blow is the header and the last one is when the ball crosses the line. For me thats a pure robbery. No matter who you support that was a low referee decision.
This is diabolical refereeing!! It is common knowledge that you wait till the ball goes back to near the middle of the pitch before blowing the whistle . Not in the middle of an attack.  Ref has just bagged himself some dodgy cash there
Ref blew before the ball was  played in end of story   nothing wrong at all in that
Disgraceful refereeing
How sad it is seeing this nonsense football has to get tougher  you simply don't see anything like this in rugby
Finally a decision not in Real's favour. I'm still thinking about the awful one sided decisions in their game against Almería
Ref has made a big mistake, but La Liga must take step against what he did !
They want girona to win the league
Can blow the whistle when he likes, had already played over the minimum injury time, nobody could have known it would end in a goal, as I say he had already played over the allotted injury time, no issue here, when time is up it is up.
Goal came 4 seconds after the whistle... Before the cross 😂
Clive Thomas
Bravo referee
Entitlement on display here is nauseating
2:33 Valencia player reaction to goal LMFAAAAOO like he just lost his new born Baby lmao christ.
Fuckin bullshit!!! As a decent ref u let the game play until it enters the other half or goes out of play simple!!! That should stand as a goal!!!!!
Who really cares about Spanish club football anymore?
ball was in the Air Barca Fan Ref....
F**k em
Fk em
Fk em
I had a bet on this game what a joke this referee
Why was only Bellingham given the red card when the whole of the Madrid team were at it?
Real Madrid think they are entitled to everything. The Valencia players stopped after the whistle went (well before the cross went in).
He blew whistle before it was crossed he cannot think hang on a few seconds real Madrid might score . Praise the ref . I like real Madrid too
Isn't that purple real madrid jersey from last season away
2:37 he puts his whistle to his mouth, then as soon as he see's the cross about to go in blows for FT. That clip stinks of corruption
Sorry but the VAR for the penalty took like 2 and abit mins so game should of carried on a little longer than a minute more, fucking joke
ref great job 👏🏻 he wasted before
was this commentator watching a different game? He goes to blow when the ball goes wide pulls his whistle away and then blows as soon as a cross is hit, 0:13 is when the I hear the whistle and its just as a cross is struck, I do not have horse in this race not a Madrid or Valencia fan and I feel this was a robbery as a football
If you watched the match he added time on to added time for time wasting by Valencia..Real Madrid  were still clearly attacking, he's got to let that attacking phase of play finish before blowing the whistle..end of story should of been a goal 💯
ANTI FUTBALL REF
When playing Pro Evolution Soccer on PlayStation back in the 2005-2009 era, the referees in that game always blew when the ball was in the middle of the pitch. I still follow them rules as a Sunday league referee all these years later. This is the reason why.
Two technicalities. 1. Two minutes over extra-time. 2. Ball had travelled beyond the penalty area after falling into possession of Valencia player ergo Madrid lost possession.   Two formalities. 1. Real Madrid were clearly attacking and in possession thus no whistle until Valencia have cleared the ball.  2. The Valencia players would have heard the whistle and stopped defending giving Madrid advantage.   The whistle should've been blown the second the goalkeeper punted the ball out. But referee seeing Madrid had lost possession, blew the whistle.
A second earlier and the player with the ball was still facing away from goal.However, the ref blows the whistle after the player turns to face goal which although it's not a rule afaik, i do think it courts controversy and for me it is bad refereeing. He should have either blown a second earlier or let the passage of play conclude.
Fair play to the ref for not taking shit of the players he blew the whistle not his fault Real Madrid players carries on playing after it clearly was blown before the ball was even kicked into the box
thief. this is ABSURD!!!!!!!!!!
He blew the whistle way before
Nothing wrong here, ref blew whistle before goal, simple. Sure you have opinion on when he should blow the whistle, but he did not go against the rule book 🤷🏾‍♂️
Harsh but fair and understandable. It was 2 minutes over the initial extra time, he gave RM the chance to score from one last corner and didnt whisle until the ball left the penalty area.
My understanding is they are not to blow the whistle while there is an 'active move' in progress - i am unsure whether that is an etiquette thing or whether that is a hard rule but either way, that was proper harsh regardless of what team you support
Ref should have ended the game when the Valencia players managed heading the ball outwards. Besides, blowing the whistle when the ball is already flying inwards seems pretty odd, to say the least. 🤔
Madrid have had unlimited luck over the years, it’s time things level out
Did he say what he said to Greenwood to the refree....
The ref blew before the cross, Madrid players need to grow up ffs
Spanish league refs are miles above premier league refs in quality
There’s no rule that says the ref has to let a team finish an attack after the time is up.
City’s oil money already showing face in La Liga it seems. 😂
He has every right to blow the whistle as it's 1.5mins over extra time. However, I've never seen a ref blow a whistle while the attack is in progress in the opposition's area. Normally, they blow the whistle after the attacking phase is over and not during.
if the ball is still in the air after the kick time should continue until the ball hits the ground
Ref did nothing wrong
i'm BLIND im DEAF im going to be a REF!
I think EVERY football fan agrees that was a goal, regardless if last attack of the game being the corner, the attack wasn't over. I bet even Valencia fans agree they got away with one there
What are they whining about? The match was over. Goals after the final whistle don't count.
What’s the problem? Ref blew whistle, defenders stopped defending. If times up at that point then time is up
Ref won €67547 for draw
vardrid cryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Bad refereeing, he should’ve blew the whistle before Diaz had the chance to cross the ball but he blew it when the cross was in.
Shocking 😲
This referees man!! They needs to be fined as well, very poor decision
The ref was looking to go home
End of the game is the end of the game. Who do they think they are. Liverpool
For Greenwood! 😁
The ref went Rambo there! Brave man
So why is the ref giving red and yellow cards after the game is finished
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha Real Madrid are such cheating scum.
7 seconds between the corner being taken and the final whistle. You can see the ref is waiting for the ball to be kicked back in, the player faked a kick then crossed it in and it was inbetween that fake kick and the actual kick the ref blew his whistle.  Why even let the corner be taken? And 39 seconds into a minute is a weird time to stop a match.  Them final seconds in added time are like minutes to the players. The other team could have scored from the kick off in the 21 seconds left. It's been done before 🤷‍♂️ or if it ran over 39 seconds then that's worse.  He doesn't even take one last look at his watch before blowing the whistle. If anything he could have blew it just as the ball came out of the area from the keepers punch, at that point it ended the initial point of play of the corner, then a new play began on the edge of the box. He just blew it mid play. I know what that's like 🤣
He played over the minimum 7 minutes, and blew before the goal was scored. Well done ref next game . Ps Real Madrid had 98 minutes to win the game so get over it .
The ball is supposed to be in play for the majority of added time. If it's not, for example because of a lengthy VAR check or a corner kick being prepared (as was the case here), then the game should not end as soon as extra time is over. The ref is supposed to account for additional out-of-play moments in added time. On top of this, the ball wasn't sufficiently cleared - normally referees wait until the defending team breaks, whereas in this case the ball never left Valencia's third of the pitch. The ref was clearly swayed by the Valencia player asking him to blow the whistle.
💩 🏡 done me over for ££££ wounded 🤦‍♂️😂
Bellingham red is the big story here.  Madrid crumble soon come?
Correct decision all the added time was played then its up to the ref after that he blew now shut the fuck up bunch of snow flakes give it a rest 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Looking forward to Xavi comment on this 😂
Cost my bet !!!
Just pathetic from the Madrid players, like spoiled children.
Reminds me of the Clive Thomas situation when he blew as a corner was coming in from which Brazil "scored" in their game against Sweden.
I bet on over 5 cards thanks ref x
this stinks, corruption at the highest level on view here!
I don’t support either Barca or real, but  stupid decision from the ref, if that’s the case the whistle shoulda blew as Diaz was running up on the wing not when he kicks the ball , goal shoulda counted
Absolute joke. Firstly if the referee called a corner kick he has to let it be taken before blowing the whistle and he cant give Bellingham a red card if he doesn't allow the goal!
He blew up before goal. Jesus. What’s the issue
starts blowing the whistle as ball is played, ends as the ball is mid air. Poor refereeing and deserves some criticism
seems like a fair decision to me imo
Should have blowed the whistle nefote the corner..was way of time anyways.. and the ball was leaving the dangerous area so he could have whistled there..so the flank wasnt part of the game anymore
Real Madrid never get to act like the victims after actions of the past
Guess Papa perez couldnt pay off the refs this time
a red card after the game is over?
Negreira again
Referees have to be held accountable for stunts like this. They can’t keep getting away with it. Granted I do find this kinda funny considering it happening to Real Madrid, but awful officiating is awful officiating no matter who it happens to.
well deserved red card for bellingham . learn to keep shut some times dude. not everyone is greenwood
This is the type of stuff fifa/ Ea fc does to me all the time 😅😂.
The ref has just been found dead...
If there is an attack generally refs play on. To blow when the ball is mid flight into the box is just bizarre. I’ve never seen that.   Referees get way too much protections because the facts is most of them should be shouted at because they are these horrible little goblins that play to their own tune.   Rules are so  blurry
Laliga and its😂 referees are a joke
Bellendingham is turning into a bit of a clown man.
real acting like they own football, nothing ever changes
Incredible ending. How ironic cross is put in ref whistles but in Liverpool game earlier today SAME TIME cross was put in no whistle blow and they score. Making a huge difference to title race. The inconsistency’s on the SAME ACTIONS FROM REFS IS INCREDIBLE
ref cant be blowing it there tho legit a cross coming in
so what's the controversy here ? he blew the whistle BEFORE the ball was in the air , plain and simple , I don't often watch la liga , but scenes like this are more likely to happen in the Serie A .. lol
He only blew the whistle because number 9 was getting on to him
Passage of play absolutely was not over. Ref should be demoted immediately. Disgraceful.
Time was up ! Ref blew the whistle clearly  before the cross went in game over go have a bath/ shower  whatever,  just leave the field and be be happy you scrapped a draw. Fkin pussies ! All of em !
Whistle was gone long before Bellingham went to head it, the Valencia defenders may have stopped defending because of the whistle
Does the rule where you cant blow the whistle during an attack not exist in spain or what?
You guys know that it was 1.5min after addrd time ? Ref allowed coner kick but it carried on so he had to stop. It happens often , example in city game ... learn rules guys. It clearly says in the booooooooooks ...
How long of the 7 minutes added on were spent on the VAR? Should have been another minute or 2 anyway. There should be a rule like rugby that the ball has to be out of play for the full time whistle to be blown. Anyway, it'll put fire in the bellies of Madrid for another few weeks.
Match fixing
Nothing wrong with it, the whistle was blown well before the ball got put in.
They need to have introduce a countdown timer on the big screen, if it's 10 mins injury time as soon the timer counts down to 0:00 the game is over. Nothing more nothing less.
Now I’ve seen it don’t know how they can complain it doesn’t matter if you’re “on the attack” time is up 😅
This stupidity is why football needs to join the 21st century.   1) Make a game of football last for 55 or 60 mins (which is the actual amount of time that the ball is in play across most leagues.) 2) Use a stopwatch. Just stop the clock when the ball goes out of play.   Not only would this eradicate controversies like this because of "referee's discretion"... it would also eliminate time-wasting in football.
Match officials are corrupt in every single league worldwide.
Couldn't happen to a nicer club
This cost me £650
Typical Madrid. Lol
A bit  like the police who are incompetent and act oblivious - the refs, VAR and commentators act exactly the same. The general public can all see an error has been made but the people who are supposed to be the professionals seem to be very incompetent at their jobs. How is so?
Look at Bellingham acting hard I genuinely can’t stand him he thinks he’s the best when he’s over rated to hell
The worst timing ever, if he blew it earlier when diaz ran wide it would of been acceptable, if he blew it later it would of been 3-2, wow 😂
Why the fk did the full time whistle blow when Madrid had an opportunity to score? Thats unfair
Cheat and I don't support either team Ridiculous
lmao real madrid players and fans acting like they dont fucking rob everyone and their mothers EVERY TIME ffs. this situation has NOTHING to do with madrid lmao the ref has the right to blow the whistle ESPECIALLY when the play slowed down abit. AND he put his whistle to his mouth 1 MIN AND 38 SECONDS AFTER THE 7 MINS AGREED OF ADDED TIME LMAO THAT WAS MORE THAN ADEQUATE ENOUGH TIME. He probably made up his mind IN HIS HEAD that after the corner he'll blow the whistle, and he even gave it a few seconds to see for any rebounds or long shots etc, the chance was gone, so he blew. madrid didnt get robbed, they're the ones that rob lmao
Games over!!! Stop crying about it!!! So many clowns in the comments
What kind of red blows the whistle at a time like that?…
This is corruptness at its best in full view. Yet people still bet on football. The ref should have simply let play run out then blow the whistle. Not as a ball is being crossed into the 6 yard box lol. Thats why i dont bet on football.
7 minutes injury time played ball went in the box then left the box ref blew the whistle stop crying
The commentators are being so bent that is a awful decision
bellingham needs to chill his tits the whistle had clearly gone.  Im sure he will apologise though as hes a level-headed guy
Ref blew the wistle before the cross. No issue here.
Let me guess Vini…the ref was racist right?
This is disgraceful, refereeing is destroying footballing talent. Send the referee off for that disgrace. What the hell happened to refereeing, you play on in situations like that until the ball is well and truly out of play, thats what they do for most offsides so why not in this case 🥴🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Real have had a few dodgey decisions have gone their way this season. So this kinda balanes things out. Still poor refereeing though.
You could also argue is the ref meant to only blow the whistle one the player has a chance to score ? He's the ref he can blow the whilst when he likes win the game in 90 mins and you won't have these problems
Barcelona probably paid him off, they have massive track record for it
And they say Madrid get favoured by refs
sack referee!
Hahaha serves them right, scumbag team
I hate Real Madrid. Thanks for that 😂
Game is almost 2 minutes OVER extra time don't know why Real Madrid players are complaining
Moving like the Nba refs 😂
Don't get the problem...the whistle went before he scored. End of. What the difference when the ball is hoofed into the box and the referee blows the whistle? Madrid need to stop crying
lol this is pure match fixing by the ref, clearly higher ups had a wager on a score draw.   Spanish football is a joke almost corrupt as the Government
This ref is a joke 😤😤 just give Jude his goal unbelievable
The ref timed it wrong. He did it in purpose
If there s gonna be 10 minutes of Real Madrid, he should keep the game on? Wtf???
They're adding on all this stoppage time now, ref's done nothing wrong by blowing the whistle. In fact, Madrid had a minute extra by getting that corner, you can't just keep playing until one team scores or the other clears it from their half.
He see's a cross is coming in
Its the ref thought,  master of kate winner's Bellingham trademark disgraceful reffing
If time is up, time is up. Don’t know what they’re moaning about. Ref clearly blows the whistle a good time before the ball is even played into the box
Vardid crying when one game goes against them😭😭😭😭😭😭
Love it...I'm a hater of both madrid and Barca...so no bias lol
Looks fair enough to a neutral.. it's well over the 7min added time and should have been blown when it was initially defended..the ref was a bit slow but the score seems fair so I don't get the fuss.
I had £50 on him to score as well. What a joke
Fair play to the ref the game was over not like the Tierney today letting Liverpool play on until they scored
7 minutes added time corner is took at 98:30 so game should have been over, Ref blew whistle before ball came in so I dunno what the rage is all about 😂 Well done Valencia a well deserved point.
Its already 1:30 mins over time when the corner comes in, the refs allows the corner, sees the ball travelling away from the box and blows. What’s wrong with that? He has to blow at some point. If the cross goes into the keepers hands no one says anything. And no I’m not a Barca fan boy.
Finally, a good referi, the spoiled kids are craying out theirselvs
whistle had to be blown before the ball was in the air. he blew it while the ball was in the air meaning it was in the middle of an attacking phase of play.
Disgraceful refereeing
Real fans crying when they don't get an Almeria style treatment. F*ck off!
1 minute and a half, extra. He is not forced to do whatever all Real Madrid fans are saying now. Wtf, he blown the wistle. Done. Bye!
If the goal doesn’t stand after the whistle surely the red card shouldn’t stand either. Game done no?
Brilliant game. Shocking finish
Sure he only got a free header because the defenders heard the whistle
What type of ref is this
It passed +7 already soo??🤷
The ref is a clown 😂😂
The referee shouldnt be blowing his whistle on the edge of the side of the penalty box just as the player is about to cross the ball. Ive seen worse but I can see why the Madrid players are pissed off.
Very good referrer
GIl Manzano embarrassing
Bro no matter what if the opponent has the ball in the opposite half and there on the attack the ref can’t blow the whistle simple as that .
player and ball were heading away from the goal almost two minutes after the allotted additional time had been played. i don't see the problem.
The ref is a joke 😡
How do you blow the whistle when its still in play?! Wtf.
the second commentator is a complete idiot, can't you listen to the whistle while the ball is in the air?
Ref was like : Im under constant pressure for making decisions that presumably help Madrid to win La liga....well I'm gonna make sure to go against Madrid this time , just to prove that I dont support them LoL
This is crazy😮
The referee of this game must be fired immediately! 🤬
He did the exact same thing at half time when the Valencia players were attacking, so why are everyone surprised?
Why did real madrid wear that kit
People can say that rules are the rules and while the ref is free to blow post the additional time, every football fan in the WORLD knows that the normal principle in football is to let the attack finish. Madrid still had the ball in a dangerous area of the pitch and were still threatening to score. It would’ve been different if the ball was near the halfway line but this ball is literally a few feet outside the box. Terrible terrible officiating.
Ref is definitely a Barca fan
Thats a robbery. How can the ref blow the whistle in middle of a cross.
This is Just pure disappointment,  referee had many bad decisions but this one was ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous
The referee is correct. The overpaid thugs who surround the referee are repugnant. Why do fans pay to watch such ill discilpined , immature people ?
So giving a red card after the whistle is allowed
you can not blow the whistle if its in the final third on a attacking move ..... they did the same to man city in janurary
I’m sorry the commentators sticking up for the ref they crossed the ball it was still in danger and he blew the whistle
Well done to the ref, he did exactly the same in the 1st half against Valencia, of course double standards from RM players. Carvajal - one of the most non fair play players to date Rodrigo - someone who in 2, 3 years will be forgotten; the "I play for RM" got to his head Vinicius - what a joke of a player; he will never be a Ballon D'Or winner and if he continues to act like a clown, the next manager might not like his childish attitude. He has yet A LOT to prove Bellingham - amazing player, too bad for the red card Modric - much better than most of the new so called "superstars" RM keeper - Small Nose Curtois will need to fight to take his place back
Why was Bellingham red carded feel like it was a not to unreasonable reaction following that decision.
Graham Hunter is such a Barca shill. The whistle went when the ball was in the air, not "before it was played"
I love Madrid but they are dead wrong for acting like this 😂😂😂
Then gets an red 3:11 😡
How can he blow the whistle when they are clearly on an attack should have waited for ball too go out of play or no one was attacking
I'm sorry but surely there on the Attack you wait until the sequence of play finishes ? The ball is still in play ▶️ it hasn't gone out ?
The Ref is an joke 2:33
If that corner was meant to be the last play of the game, the only issue I see here is the ref not blowing the whistle earlier as Diaz runs out to the side of the pitch
Why the fcuk the red card is valid and the goal isn’t? That’s is disgraceful… shit disgrace!
Thats a goal was 7sdded and ref wasted like 3-4min for var should of played to 99min/100min tbh
Bro didn't get paid
HAHAHAHAHA
No Madrid always cheats now there no hw it feels....kkkk ref
Shocking, absoutely abysmal refereeing. You can see him put the whistle to his mouth about 2 seconds before he actually blows it, he literally waits for the cross to be sent in before he blows. Should be sacked, fucking sick of these shit refs constantly desperate to be at the centre of attention.
Ha
The ref should have blown whistle after the initial corner had been successfully defended. Technically that was the final attack of the game, the next phase shouldn’t have been allowed to happen. Bizarre.
Lost my bet..had bellingham to score and 3:2 win.. abs gutted
Madrid getting a taste of their own medicine.
If I said it once I've said it 1 million times. AUTOMATE FOOTBALL REFEREEING!!! The modern referee doesn't contribute to anything valuable to football. NEVER!
He  blew before the cross .. fuck off
They already played 1:30 minutes over, what are they complaining about...
He did nothing wrong the whistle went the ball was cleared he already played past the added time.
Valencia would defend the cross if the whistle hadn't have gone, why are they acting like they just scored a valid goal in legitimate circumstances
commentators dont have a clue
The ref blew the whistle long time they should be no argument
Refs these days keep showing poor judgement and no common sense
Ref: "My bet - My rules!"
How is anyone complaining about this?
Whistle was actually blown when the ball was in the air…poor refereeing tbh
Ludicrous decision to blow the whistle when he did but there was no way he could allow that after he’d blown
the ref is right had every right to blow the wistle there
CORRUPT as usual but idc im in england lol
Viaplay needs new commentators, these clowns have no idea
You gotta say, ref blew the whistle before the cross was made
Lol football is not for the weak
Nothing to complain about, blew the whistle way before
Maybe the referees needed to do this after the backlash that they got for when Madrid didn't deserve to win that other game.
Guys he fucking blew the whistle way before he scored real Madrid are fucking stupid and u guys that are annoyed by this your just idiots
Already nearly 2 minutes over, be happy you even got the corner let alone ANOTHER chance to cross the ball in
Game was done
Ref blew the whistle just after brahim kicked it in
this commentator is a fucking clown. The referee didn't blow the whistle when he says he did. He blew the whistle just as the ball was hit for the cross which is in a dangerous position. You can't just blow the whistle where there's a chance.
So the goal doesn't stand but the red card stands? interesting ...
The ref didn’t do anything wrong, Valencia players stopped defending, the whistle was gone
Yep, he is a secret Barca fan! :)
Ref had a bet on the game ending in a draw. Check his laptop. He probably has other stuff on there he shouldn’t have as well…
Great refereeing
Tried to pull a Liverpool haha unlucky Madrid 😅
TBF from a referring standpoint.....it was the same attack phase....wait until the ball is cleared and then blow. Why blow when its crossed into the box.....madness..
One of those "look at me" refs that can't handle their responsibility
Vardrid getting what they deserve 😂😂😂😂
Bad form to blow the whistle in the midst of a promising attack, but the bottom line is that he did. So it’s no goal.
As a Real Madrid fan the ref had blown the whistle and I don’t know why we are moaning like idiots. You can’t carry on playing after the game has ended, that’s dumb
silly cunting refs, he was so unbothered by it bc he thinks he’s above everyone…. ridiculous….without the players he wouldn’t have the job simple
Funny seeing carvajal annoyed when he’s been spared red cards on countless occasions
👏👏👏
Why they moaning for are they deaf the whistle went hours before the cross
disgrace for laliga
Get it up them
Bust my bet 😢
The commentator is wrong. The whistle is in his mouth before the cross is taken but he doesn’t begin to blow until the ball is mid air. It’s a poor decision and he seems to do it after the Valencia player complains to him.
How can u give a card after the game and not give a clear goal 💀💀💀
The soft speaking commentator had been against Madrid from the first whistle
Shades of Clive Thomas during that 1978 World Cup match between Brazil and Sweden.
No complaint, the whistle had gone a while ago
Well they did steal a win against that low place team a few weeks ago at the bernabeu so it works both ways.
They'd already had over 1.5 minutes over the minimum added time. There is nothing to complain about.....
And people say vardrid 😂
So he gives out red cards after the match but not the goal ye🖕
The ref is probably a Barca fan lol 😂
Bellingham Goal should count
Amunt Valencia 🦇
Thanks ref for keeping the title interesting 💀
It’s good decision.😊
