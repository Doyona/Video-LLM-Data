One word to describe this run please
MENTAL
Fan plus conventional ground effects? Could be faster, I don't know..
Actually sounds exciting too 🤘
Beep Beep
unbeatable
0:01 🤯
I love this video because it shuts up the goofy people who say that electric vehicles have a long way to go
Sorry I asked. As you were.
imagine racing and end up being overtaken by a glorified roomba. xD
Baby batmans car😂😂
Sounds like my ebike 😂🤡💩
Hope we see the pure soon!
That's incredibly fast but boring
Stunning performance. Not likely to ever be beaten.
The IRL equivalent to the sesto elemento forza edition
Funny that we probably wouldn't be able to hear the crowds raw reaction, if this car happened to be just as quick with a "gas" engine.
It's like watching a cartoon 😂😂😂  Bonkers corner speed 👍
Get a life .....
That track is actually the driveway to the house
Great, now do it again 🙄
Is this all electric? 😊
I had the pleasure of seeing this run by the hay bales. It’s incredible on the video but words cannot describe seeing it live.
so fast, never been to see before.
AND THE TIME WAAS????????
Let Richard Hammond drive it
When a monster was born
That's fast 😮
What was the record before they broke it
That is a literal slot car
Why don't you show the time...or did I miss something?
Robert Kubica test plis 💪
this driver is amazing
No Way! It’s true then what I seen on all those videos about the British engineers and doctors that came from Africa and the Middle East. They must have mastered this EV. It could only be them having created everything magnificent we have today.  At least that’s what they claim.  This car is no exception. Congratulations asylum seeker. I mean British residents. 👏 👏 👏
How do we make sporty electric cars sound like this🤯?
Electric cars are no fun they said 😮
Bruce Wayne : hmph, they copy my tech
Devastating.... the only word you need
Going to be real interesting if that fan fails.
That car corner like having a railway, hats off to the driver for being able to tame the G force out of that car.
The Batmobile!
ダウンフォース（押し付ける力）というよりは吸引力やな
Even aliens were freaked out watching this.
On 70's chaparral do that só! And go banned brabhan too
Crazy nutz
筑波サーキットでアタックして欲しい！🤩
Sarà anche veloce ma rimane una merda elettrica...🥱
What brand is that car?
That down force, made them wheels part of the road. This was freaking badass!
Now the only question remains that really matters is can it rally?
When you only need to travel 2 miles takes 3 seconds but takes 2 hours to charge
This thing caused the earth to spin faster
Reminds me of KITT, while in super pursuit mode.
It looks like its glitching the reality engine
It needs downforce fans to make it handle as well as it does.   Got it.   As soon as I get one of these, I'll go buy a mountain bike with training wheels, and a sportbike with a wheelie bar.  Woohoo!
Phenomenal!
vaccum,carro,eletrico e som de turbina🤤🤤🤤
It's like the video is in fast-forward. It's absolutely insane.
It really does look sped up
I want that to lap the ring.
My wish from RR3 gods.
So THAT'S why the Bat Mobile had a smoke trail behind it... fans creating suction!
Terrific!
Go Nurnburgring and break the record of Porsche Hybrid Ca (5:XX min lap record)
Electric up the hill is soooo dull!
You need some big balls to do that 😂
Batman needs one of these
beautiful , but I think it should be in its own electric catgory and not as general record , respect to fuel engine cars
The fact some people stil insist on badmouthing EVs because they aren't as 'satisfying' as traditional cars is just sad. The future is here, old men, enjoy the friggin' speed and handling, and the genius of engineering + driving talent.
While I have no interest in an EV, I have to admit, this is pretty fast.
The stewards reaction at the beginning 🤷‍♂️😂
incomprehensible
Is it available in black?
Insane !!
Sounds and looks just like the electric car race tracks we had in the early 70's. Nice one was made in Germany but cost a fortune for a blue collar kid. Google: Carrera Avus
SilwerClaw
Bro is litteraly: "✈✈✈⚡⚡"
I remember a few years go, watching kids play with really fast RC cars in the street, “It would be crazy if a real car could move like that same speed to scale” . This is it.
Really hope it gets a chance at Monaco one day
Its Batman
Witnessed this first hand, never been an EV fan but if this the future count me in
Welcome to the Era of the McMurdery
This doesn’t even make sense
Nuckinfutz
0:20 i cant tell you how many times ive rewatched just this corner, how he just accelerates through it like a straight! 😂 that cant be possible!!
Looks like a 1960s film X 1.5 speed.
Real life scalextric
Pure mental
i liked to see it run pikes peak, how close would it be to other cars.....
Real life Bat Mobile.
Lap was so fast, the youtube UI popped up halfway through the video.
Complete rubbish, records are for ICE cars not electric
Imagine casually doing this speed up your driveway. Insane
That car is special 😮 even the camera has a hard time tracking it. Hats off to the british engineers, technicians and mechanics, this is next-gen on a whole other level.
RIP Sir David McMurtry.  A humble but brilliant engineer. One that achieved many great things; globally - but in particular - locally, for the community. What an amazing legacy he has left behind.  Sir David McMurtry co-founded his company Renishaw in the 1970s after working as an aviation engineer for Rolls Royce. Renishaw's forte is metrology, but McMurtry never stopped inventing & innovating. Renishaw's motto is 'Apply Innovation'.  Mr McMurtry probably wouldn't want to be mentioned here, but I felt his passing should be marked.
68mph
0:01 that’s absolutely nuts (crazy)
Well, I guess that's a third car for if I win the lotto. The others being a singer 911 and an icon bronco.
Its like the cheat car in videogames.
so sick! McMurty is based only 20mins away from me! british engineering is undefeated
If they can find that thing to run for 24 hours, I think it would win Le Mans
I want one! Wow
It came, It saw, It conquered.
The marshal at the beginning😂 Probably thought someone just speeded past them...
world's fastest roomba
グッドウッドのEV記録には頭のおかしいマシンが1台いるからなぁ…
This is         Next Level .....
SR71
Flicked-pea fast -that’s the best description I’ve seen of this insane thing
having a fan sucking it to the ground is straight up cheating
Kozey Terrace
Michele Fields
Isobel Stream
Hagenes Radial
Felton Spring
Eve Tunnel
Quitzon Loop
Ashleigh Pines
Devastating
It's like watching a slot car!
Buck Hill
Cloyd Shore
This is pod racing!
O'Keefe Harbors
Becker Rest
Wiza Pine
Looks like a Scalextric car.
Treva Center
If that’s what time Max Chilton got imagine the time Verstappen or Hamilton could set!!! 😂😂😂
Thats a real Current💪
Mcdonalds finally decided to make a car
Marlon Branch
BONITA LAVADORA
Absolutely bonkers!
the fastest performance cars test track on the planet , and the bands are made of hey :D
Imagine driving that thing at speed!
9763 Senger Course
All the old dinosaurs and uneducated schmucks that think this is EV trash are absolutely bonkers 🤣🤦🏻‍♂️🤣

Huel Mission
love listening to monosyllabic girl by NOFX to this run.. fits so well..
when Scrooge McDuck enters the soap box derby..  XD
every part of me both wants to drive that and never wants to drive that.. 😳
Turn that vacuum cleaner off 😡...
OK, I don't get it.  Where's the hill?  Looks flat to me.  Anyone else thinking there should be a hill in a hill climb?
those p50b cells r ridiculous. the best 21700 cells bby far!
BRING BACK THE DONUTS
Ngl that car looks sick but also like a enlarged hot wheels car
Future of the F1 I believe
no donuts. no interest!
Goofy Ahh Car breaks WR
When she says shes home alone
A Giant RC car 😅
one lap it is fast, a few laps battery died
You know it’s a fast lap when the subscribe button comes on half way through to signify the end of the video
Just shows how impressive the MP4-13 was.   Doesn't have 2 tonnes of downforces at any speed. Doesn't have instant power, or 1000hp. Still only 2 seconds slower than this purpose built gimmick car.
The only way possible to break this record is with another fan car. You can't do it with just wings & skirts. You need a fan literally "forcing" the car to the ground as u throw it around that circuit.
OOOOOOOOMG😯😯😯😯
so, it took this to beat a 25 years old F1 car...
The speeeeeeed
This is a formula E car right?
anybody else crying ?
I will break this record boss
Incredible. Would like to see a track record attempt on the Monaco f1 track to compare to modern F1’s performance
One of the most insane things I’ve ever seen.
I’m pretty sure that’s just the car from little rascals…
Tiny car with a thousand hp
Batman won
Welcome to Gapplebees may I take your order?
They honestly should of gave this thing a GEE-BEE race livery. White and Red. And yes it was a airplane.
It drives like those cars from Death Race 2000
It looks like we finally got those cars from death race
Why are you so fast? "Big balls"
Like a jet plane.
It takes off like a Star Wars ship going into hyperspace.
Does it come in black…
When does Waldo from the little rascals hop off?
😍😮
This thing makes it look like it's going at supersonic speeds
So batman wasn't that far away with his design
looks like an RC car
Sound like a mixer, run like a rocket
That’s not fair EVs should have their own category they have a massive advantage over ICE cars in terms of acceleration and braking
Unreal
Travis Pastrana con el Subaru de rally está segundo en la tabla de récord de pista, segundo detrás de este auto . Que locura, corrió con un auto de rally a un súper auto
Mc merky speirling car driver is laughing at the corner .
The guy in the beginning got scared and put his arms up like he was mad haha
Still love Pastrana’s run better.
Petrol is well and truly dead
Remove that wall
What’s all that brownish dust coming out of it in the back?
epik
bro built the real life batmobile
Watch the guy on the right at the beginning and his reaction.
Science of succion and tire grip at its best!🎉
I hope they put this in gta6
Welcome to the future where cars sound like vacuum cleaners
The short wheelbase is it's secret
That's an insane cornering speed ! I want to see it increase its top speed and take on the Nürburgring.😍
This car will destroy, Hypercars, LMP1 and even F1 in terms of lap times.
my wife on black friday...
The fastest milk kart in the west
Jet
It's a damn airplane, we are reaching a point where the driver reaction speed is not enough anymore haha
Why did dude on starting line get mad?
No a car but an RC-toy where the remote control doesn’t work
Watching on 2x play speed to see what a 20 second run would be like
How fast do you want to go?    Yes 😁
They need to make a  sport that is tuned specifically to these cars, can you imagine a group of these flying down the track?
Damn it looks like this thing is driving on tracks
This car is illegal it must be banned 😂
I'd love to see how hot some of the components get after a run like this.
The size of the car seems like a perfect fit for Richard Hammond. Maybe the company should let him test the car. Not the crash test I suppose
Perfect... except for the cringy greeny message at the end.
This should be the next new Bat Mobile
Its better than f1 car, it can’t be catched. Mcmurty is the top car ever,its a ground missle, u cant catch it
Ground missle
Last golden jet car from rumble racing in ps2
0:01 THE CREW TO THE RIGHT GOT SCARED AND WENT 🤷. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
2 secs faster than a 23 yr old record
Car name?
Fastest man on a Sunday..? And Monday to Saturday, what a little packet rocket 🚀
This reminds me of Anakin’s pod racer! Sounds the same too!
This could be my daily
going that fast i'm surprised that driver can still see the road well enough to do hand and eye coordination to avoid crashing... in that bat mobile lol
They took an RC-10 and turned it human sized
👍
Can somebody PLEASE give it a VW beetle carbon fiber shell, paint number 53 on it and race it in the LeMans GT3 class? Please, it would be a dream.
🗨️💣
Holy wheelbase Batman!
Please remove the DHL form this video. The parcel delivery is so slow.
That start-line official, looked absolutely offended, when that thing left...LOL!  Got yourself a subscriber!
This is awesome, but where did Mcmurtry go? I was hoping to see this car break records around the world and yet they did one thing and disappeared.  Where were they at Pikes Peak? Nurbergring? Come on. Let's go! I Wana see it dominate everyone 😅
She’ll go faster!
The thing with this specialist type vehicle is the driver made it look all under control.    The IDR was the same. But this looks like it has so much more margin to go faster because it’s so tiny on the road.
one word to describe the size of this dudes cajones please
It's a slot car.
how this car sticks to the aspault
This thing is faster than my tamiya..
One word "wow"
Looks like a 1970s sci-fi film car chase, sped up lol WOW.
World's Fastest Vacuum Cleaner
Give it the speed racer livery
Now that's a grocery getter for the ages. You can get to the store and back with the bacon before the eggs are finished frying. Would love to take it for a spin.
0:38 it literally sounds like it broke the sound barrier…
Holy crap. We always knew the Batmobile could move, but this new version is fast.
The edit sounds like multiple turbo boosts.
What a ludicrously idiotic looking design. This most be the most retarded looking sports car in history.
I feel like I didn't love electric cars until I saw this...   How has this amazing news evaded me for a year ???
ES UNA BAÑERA HORRIBLE.
Why does it sound like an electric car with a straight cut gearbox?
I hate to say it as a through and through petrol head, but........i dont `alf want one of them!!!
Just think with an elite driver in this it could probably go a bit faster
I’m really into bikes because they’re ridiculously fast, and typically take far more skill to operate fast than a car. That being said, I think this is the fastest thing I’ve ever seen on a road circuit. I’m wondering if it could complete a lap at the ‘Ring?
Make it amphibious, boat hull bottom and skids with tires that recess for running on open water... or ice:)
Chills.
Looks very hard to control
That's just knuts!!!! Looks like Batman on a track day powered by a Whitney and Pratt SR71 ramjet engine...Im not a huge fan of electric cars , never have never will but I absolutely adore that thing
I was at McMurtry the other day, all I can say is it’s an incredible car! I wish I could say more but I signed an nda just to look at it, seeing as it was in pieces. Amazing bit of engineering🤟😊
Electric > fuel
Here because of Joe
The excitement of the crowds on McMurtry vs gen 3 FE really speaks for itself 😅
Crazy thing to get that type of time out of the hillclimb and still be able to hear the spectators clapping👀
I will never use DHL again.
Sounds and drives like a real batmobile
Thats Crazy batmobile 😂😂😂
looks speeded up :D
Awesome
Those hay bales are not going to be sufficient if anything happens.
Absurd vehicle
Grey batmobile
WOW WOW WOW 😮
This is the only EV car that would not pass a fuel emissions test. LMAO! Watch all the fumes and smoke coming out the back of this EV car.  It is NOT tire smoke as you see it when or where ever it accelerates even on straight a ways with no wheel spin.
it literally vacuum cleaned the circuit
I thought this is speed forward omg!!!
They put water on a monster RC car and that's the results 😂
If this isn’t put into GT7 in an update, it would be very sad.
The new chapparal 2j?
Bonkers
Sounds like a x wing
BATMAN
hopefully this is the new batmobile
Das Auto soll mal zeigen auf Nordschleife wS es kan gegen einen 919
batman on crack be like :
With the body being so narrow it can use more of the track for the corners. Genius
This thing makes it look like the video is 2X speed. Straight Bonkers
It caught up to its own dust...
I thought it was a toy lol
Help me understand how a few hay bales would stop a car like this from treating the crowd like bowling pins?
How do i get it to 1x speed? Its stuck on 2x
HER: hey my parents just left, i'm home alone. HIM:
It ran faster than 39 this year. Too bad it wasnt timed, but you could see from video timestamps it went second or so faster.
This vacuum has no business being this fast
I blinked and missed the show 😅
😚
So, that car will never be used for a racing season or group, the FOS is to show and tell brilliant cars over our history, not be try hards
...did they speed up the footage?
That things is absolutely insane
Es una bala !!!🚀
👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹
Next...Redout. For less.
Watched a few longer videos explaining about this car and it’s amazing
This looks like 2x speed 😂
Utterly absurd car.
There is the roar of an engine.... But with this you hear the Roar of the earth!
I think F1 should switch to these cars. We just have to find a way to provide power through the race track. ...like speed power-ups in racing games...ha.
I bet this car is in the next Batman movie
Video seems acelerate like Batman Series in the 70'
Did he break the sound barrier??
are you winning son? YES
To the Batmobile!
Insane
This time will get beaten next year. By McMurtry again.
Floats like a Butterfly Stings like a Bee and Sounds like a Formula E car
Looks like a batmobil :-)  👍
This event isn’t really safe for spectators. At such speeds, a car could easily rollover and exit the track.
Absolutely insane! The whole video looks fast-forwarded lol
Hes sucking all the dust from the ground and throwing it back out at the rear making it looks like vapor cone going super sonic
That record I think will stay for a while.
Bruce Wayne: Does it come in black?
*Physics* has left the session
it was actually so fast it met up with its own dust
It's so fast. It feels like im watching it in fastforward!
⚡️⚡️⚡️💪  getn it done
O_O   woah
If this car makes it to a videogame, i'm gonna do the comparison of the century....  McMurtry Speirling against the mighty Red Bull X2014 Standard around the Nürburgring  Fastest lap time wins  EDIT: Just to clarify that the fan car versions of red bull X1s are way too overpowered...
Mcl
I won tickets for the Sunday 16th can't wait!
The 2023 Red Bull F1 car, if pushed to the limit, would get close to 30 seconds. So, it is nice that the old record was broken but don't think for a millisecond that 39.08 is something unbeatable by other vehicles. Actually, there are F1 cars from the 1980s that would beat 39 seconds with a maniac like Ayrton behind the wheel. The average speed of this run was 174.1 km/h (108.2 mph). Monaco 2023 pole is 177 km/h (110 mph). And that is a MUCH slower track! For example, the GT-R Nismo had an average speed of 138 km/h in Goodwood but can only do around 115 km/h in Monaco! The average speed in Goodwood is therefore around 20% higher than in Monaco. That means Max could do about 59 metres per second in Goodwood. That is 32 seconds!
Hats off to their whole team, especially, of course, the driver!! What an amazing record-breaking run! The way this car performs reminds me a lot of when the Ruf "Yellowbird" outperformed the Lamborghini Diablo and Lamborghini Countach, the Porsche 959, the Ferrari Testarossa, the Lotus Esprit Turbo, and the Corvette ZR1 back in the glory days of Test Drive: The Duel, way back in the late 80s and early 90s.  Those cars were THE hottest supercars of their time, and the little upstart RUF outperformed them all!!! This upstart McMurty Speirling is the little engine that could!!! I'm just not sure if it represents the future of supercars.  Performance wise it's more than there.  But the look of the car, and the sounds it makes...it's just not supercar material. And while there are a lot of electric supercars out there, I'm just not sure about their long-term future.  I'm starting to think that e-fuel might be a better alternative to the current electric craze.  We shall see!!
Give Batman his car back !
It was insane to see this in person go up the hill, I was incredibly lucky to see this in person
I thought I accidentally left the video on 1.5x speed. Insane.
Can't wait to see this beast beating the 919 Hybrid record in Nürburgring.
Got giant stones that Max.
My 2021 Mazda CX-5 Turbo is faster.
Silent car is very dangerous ..
The run looks like it's being played at 150% playback speed
This is the first EV I've seen that was actually exciting to watch and hear.
The DHL logo is out of place hee...
The only ev car ill ever get hands down they got it lol
This is the most ridiculous car ever in every sense of the word. 😄
Gas is dead.
تحسها رشيقة كأنها سيارة لعبة تحكم من بعيد
It's the roost of dirty and dust behind it that gets me
Bro that beast sounds like that one next gen car from Cars :O
if the McLaren Mp4/13 drives again, on modern slicks, the car will easily break the record of the this electric vacuum cleaner.
Stunning.
Are you sure you didn’t speed up the film??? 🤔
The only thing I don't like is the name... Sounds like a burger special at McDonald's 😂
Where is the excitement of the rumble, the chest rumble when a real race car goes by you? 😂😂
39.08 will stand for some time.
The reason it couldn't go any quicker is that the balls of the driver were too heavy.
That thing is licking speed
The car looks like a toy haha Awesome run
Where is the engine noise ? Goddard perf but I passe.
Unreal…I laugh hysterically each time I rewatch this, it’s just so laughably nuts.
If I didn't know better I'd have thought the video was sped up
やっぱし  シュイーーーーーーーーーーーーン  じゃ盛り上がらない
Things looks like a scalextrics
Why did they ban fan cars in modern day racing?
You should be at Pikes Peak to prove it wasn't a fluke.
Deberían dejarlo con la velocidad original
ok now off to the ring.
so much dust tho
Now, that sucked.
Cracking
It corners like a scalextric car. Absolutely insane
guy in the start lane.. like, where is the carrr????
Hah this looks like fast motion, what a quick car I'm amazed 👏
With all that dust behind it, looks like it breaks sound barrier
This car looks and moves like a tiny RC car... but it fits a human. Just incredible.  I saw Mat Watson casually beating the 1/4 mile record with it, insane
So this is what happened to my old Dyson vacuum cleaner
That’s insane.
I’m pretty sure that’s a rocket… !
A grown R/C car.
the size and speed remind me of a remote control car
Should only hold the record for a fan car, not overall against competitors who are at a massive disadvantage, I think this record is bogus.
For a moment I thought I was playing at 1.5x speed 😂😮
Sounds like that funny cat whine they do lol
залупа электрическая, звук v8 вечен....
What would happen if it rolls???? Those people aren't safe at all!!!!!!!!! Where's the safety for those cars going 170+kmph
That last clip look like batman just came out of nowhere working day shift
Never seen any other car that can go into warp speed like the opening of Star Trek
sure it may not make engine noises, but at that speed i think the wind noise is way cooler than the engine would've ever been
Wow. Was ist das denn für eine Rakete.🫣🫣👌👍😂😂
When is this going to hit the dealerships??? LOL
This isn't just fast. It's FAST holy guac capn
There is NO way this is real..
looks like batmans first batmobile
Imagine if dodge built a tomahawk 😂
Times are changing, progression is here, comparing EV to NA nowadays is like comparing NA to steam powered engines back in the day. You cant stop this.
I hate the future, motor sports are going to suffer when we have no gas engines. Just hearing transmission whining zzz
That is an insane piece of kit
It runs out of battery at the end of the run just as fast as it reaches it
When I saw this clip at first, I thought someone had sped it up. Brain wouldn't accept a car that looked this fast.
Go home all you FUEL ENGINE drivers with your cars! Your time is over! This record is done without air and noise pollution you loosers!
78 Barbham proud of this offspring.
スズキのカプチーノくらいの大きさかな、すごいコンパクトな車体だ！
The first time I saw this car I thought it was a joke 🤣
Even the sound is surreal. It just sounds so alien, like a smal spacecraft whooshing through the haystack
This look like rocketship on 4 wheels, INSANE ! I wonder if the tesla roadster with the spaceX package will do better
Looks like a RC car
Cepat dan stabil hebat 👍👍👍
It's like a real life batmobile 😯.
There’s something very Flash Gordon about that car….
Electric vehicles dont have soul.
I’m surprised it could go that quick, due to the size of the drivers massive balls!
You could say this car is really quite, fan-tastic.
What
Girl: "I am alone" Boy:
0-60 1.40 seconds is ridiculous
I'd like to see this car on a dragstrip. Curious what it would do in the 60ft and 1/8th mile
Every body :'' what was that? Did you see anything? ''
Is it faster than F1?
That car just break Mach 3
It's almost scary to watch.
Sick!
I imagine it as a little nerdy speedy Gonzales at the Disney Cars Universe if it ever exists there
Paint it white and youd have speed racer
Beep..beep...
It moved so fast, it look like shock waves emanating from the back of the car. Almost cartoonish in appearance.
Formula E should looks more like this
reminds me of the 2j Chaperal
This is so totally me after shotgunning 6 beers going through a school zone at 3 PM
Midget Batmobile
They need to develop it enough to do pikes peak now.
Does it come in black....?
This guy did drive faster, then we would be driving in a video game😕
he would have gotten a faster time if his balls werent so heavy
It’ll beat your kids power wheels I’ll tell ya that
People can dislike ev 's.  There is no arguing though that this thing is the bedrock for the future of performance.  A sub 8 sec quarter with no traction control on a damp surface.  Just amazing what they have done with thus car.  Well done gentlemen .
How different is this from an F1 for a driver? Being constantly sucked to the ground while cornering must feel difficult I bet?
Batman's cars are getting crazier and crazier
This will break every record.
I want one.
Looks like a hacked video game car. Insane.
It's like if a F1 car and a dragster had a baby and it liked Batman.
F1 banned the use of "suction" fans.
This is an amazing car.  The fan downforce concept is crazy!  They just need to make it longer and wider.  😂
Ridiculous machine. It looks like a toy car speeding off a track
Holy...
Scaletrix! 😂❤
this is like playing gta with a mod menu to have gravity of jupiter so you corner fast
This is the direction F1 should have gone in if it was interested in speed. I want to see this technology used in motorsport to see just how fast cars can go. Like speed racer with loop d loops etc.
This is faster then the recent record breaker volkswagen id.r by 1 mil of a second.  39.9 or am I missing something? 🤔
Astonishing!!
IDR: 🤬🤬🤬
Quick-grip
Never should have left renishaw in 1986. Well done dave.
That was 39 sec??? It felt like 15 sec watching it ._.
Take it to pikes peak
Why does it have exhaust smoke?
The only car the camera men missed taking a picture off lol
The sound is crazy ,just wind.
코너링 보소. ㅅㅂ 땅에 붙었네
imagine cuttin up in traffic with this
So you guys are saying DHL is going to use these for their smaller parcels, right?
The fins on the top come into play when it's going sideways! Really! That's nuts :)
But can it best the porche 918 hybrid on nurtburgring?
hoover on wheels :D
Este lo conocí por carwow
Electric
Back to the Future - Chaparral 2J Can-Am (1970 year), Brabham BT46C (1978 year)
you only need to watch the first two seconds of this video to know the thing is insane.  The attendees' reactions is priceless.
Damn, it looks like a slot car .
It’s like top gun vs Dyson love the dust spirals out the rear and now the track is cleaned
Yea a drone ain’t following this thing any time soon
Watched this do a 7.97 1/4 mile and that was when it was still in this Goodwood gearing setup, so it hit it's 150mph limiter after 5 seconds. Bonkers car, even if of limited use in everyday or even on the track.
The fastest vaccum cleaner ever see
It's so fast that it looks like a fake video. This thing is insane.
What rubber?
Who is here from CarWow?
Even the Stewart on start line was confused when the car is gone 🤣
Man will always love fast car,but this is beyond ur imagination,yet it really exist...damn
Pocket Rocket
This is more like a jet fighter without wings. Damn...
Extreme commitment for every turn  with this car
idk why but it looks so funny
The fact it’s gonna be a road car
Fan cars are new... they've been around since the late 70s and were immediately made illegal by F1 due to the advantage.
Just when I thought British Engineering was dead…
It’s like watching the bat mobile 😮
we need this car in forza horizon lol
ひぃー😱
The car without strong engine sound is not a car.
bro we are on trackmania
C'est à chiez, il n'y a aucun son de moteur. Belle prouesse du pilote en revanche.
Mcmurty for F1 2023 safety car!
That was intense! Can I relax my sphincter now?
Cooling is it's biggest limitation; even more than battery life, that tells you how extreme it is.

No
The speed of this thing and the way it goes in the corners is almost impossible
Just come back to watch this again.... Just watched all the 700-1000 bhp quick stuff and the race cars and then had to recalibrate!!!! even 800hp fast stuff doesn't look quick at some point even when you know it really is, this thing is in an insane other dimension altogether !! it's comedy fast, like sped up fast! 🤣 That is insane!
oh wait i think i had youtube on X2 speed.............................................ahm.....huh its on normal ?
Frightening lightning
Elon
0:02 by the time old mate at the start line has reacted, it's already doing 100km/h... like driving a rocket. this is insanity. doesn't look like it'd handle corners well, but short wheelbase and *fan car* makes a world of difference for agility. a few decades ago, the Brabham BT46B and the Chaparral 2J were booted off tracks for having the same winning advantage.
Does it comes in black?
F1 has about 5 years left..... then it might as well just be a celebration of internal combustion because this thing is faster already
create so much downforce you can actully see it.
Nice try guys we know you sped up the footage.....right?....
This car handles so well its like its in fast forward with its movements
ths real life BatMobil..crazy
0:02 the marshal. 🤣
The best 39.08 seconds of my life.
Looks like one of those old comedies where they fast forward to make a car look fast
Jim Hall would be so damn proud of this.  He had this idea in 1970 with the Chaparral 2J.  Now fast forward to the 2020s, and a sucker car is a record holder.
the modern day chaparral 2j
Still 2 seconds slower what Heikki did with F1 2005 renault. But it looks fast!
This car should just go around the world destroying lap records in all tracks. That would be amazing to see. And tracks are smooth e enough to get the full affects of this car. Only limitation would be drivers ability.
Need 30kw generator + parendev motor inside that car.
Is this not the rocket car from Simpsons hit & run 🧐
👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
ELECTRIC!
Man, it's not often you hear literal gasps from a crowd at a racing event. I still love ICEs but this is the future.
Astonishing.
I love how terrifying this is.
Although Max Chilton wasn’t the best IndyCar driver, he was amazing at this! Holy moly! It’s intense when I see this!
💩😳
Who would win? a)1000 hypercars b) literally a Dyson on wheels
Wow !
The rule of thumb is, if it looks fast on the camera it’s insanely fast irl. But this looks insanely fast on the camera so it’s probably mind-bending fast irl
What's scary is that you can see that this thing could be pushed faster, way faster. With practice and a kamikaze driver, this thing could probably push a 37 second run
it looks like the video is playing in fast forward. BUT IT'S NOT
imagine where we'd be by now if these cars werent banned from competition when they debuted so many years ago. blame McLaren for throwing a tantrum until the car it couldn't beat was disqualified.
What just happened
that old man like ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ xD
R.I.P VW idr
I still can't get my head around how fast this thing is, fair play to the driver for being able to handle it
The guy in the beginning said "how come?"
And they say Batman is fictional.
Was that car electric?
I was there with my 3 brothers and 1 stepbrother and my mum and stepdad and you can see our red hats at the edge where it gose ouahhh 😂
I was in awe...
Awesome
0:46    BY 2030...DHL has committed to invest €7 BILLION in green innovations for a more sustainable future  Is that your "Green new Deal Agenda"? The state prescribes electric cars for the citizens, but at the same time tells something about saving electricity? Exactly my sense of humour.
It looks like a baby, sounds like a baby, just doesn't move like a baby
insanity.
Diabolical. Truly, an unfair fight. Fast doesn't describe it.
Next time just fly a plane at low level...
I watched at 0,5x speed and it still looks fast
Its is arguably the best car sprint in history. It looks like braking laws of physics.
My watch was a said it was faster than 39
cant believe that some fans of Goodwood road & racing built a car that would break the record !
Insane!
I want to see this car lap at Monaco.
Jee-Zus....
Makes an absolute mockery of FE when an electric car can do this.
Watched it live.  Still gives me goosebumps!   Engineering marvel.  Well done everyone involved.  Thats a ev id drive.
And, I wonder.... Who put the Driver's Visor Down in that half-a-minute? This being a single-seat car, and That flat-ish hillclimb (as opposed to Ascutney or Equinox or Okemo or Washington here in New England) being rather an Obstacle-Course in the first few turns... {?}  Looks to me like Both hands were needed just in Steering it.
Sounded 💩
That's Absolutely, FAST!! Love it!
That launch gave me whiplash just watching it.
Dyson, we never loose suction, this thing says hold my beer , will vacuum entire race track in under 40 second's
I watch it like that guy on 0:01
Everyone was surprised it gripped that corner. What an amazing machine.
Imagine this doing a nurburgring run
That launch was just absurd.
A few months ago I saw a video of that car, as a not fully developed vehicle. I knew back then it was gonna make waves.
Chapparal 2J Part 2
junge steiger..
unbelievable :)   it can been seen that the electric sports car future will be amazing with great opportunities.
Thats crazy
Awesome!
Just the balls to drive with such a level of precision using a vehicle that go that fast is incredible.  The whole run you could tell that the vehicle gave the driver nothing but confidence to go all out
Time to start calling cars "roadplanes".
Sem graça
Rock hard display
And as a bonus it hoovers the track while it's going
The Marshall at the start jumping...😂
Over glorified slot car
It will probably be considered too radical and be banned from motorsport. Epic achievement though.
I want to see this race against an F1 car and FE car ….
when you set gravity to jupiter gravity in BeamNG drive
If the fan breaks while in a hard curve? RUD!
omg ddd
💨
Blazing run, absolutely nuts.
I wanna see this sucker take on Pike's Peak.
I just love how tiny it is
Amazing
Okay so boycott DHL okay gotta green energy doesn't work it only make things more expensive witch it really racism because 49% of the people on welfare are black.   Green energy is white people Solution to make black people even poorer
Super Groby ?
The handling on that thing 👌
This  <car> should have been banned for the same reason as was the BRABHAM bt 46b fancar, Its a dangerous anomaly of a car not functional in a road environment. Shame on you Brits for pressing to have sth breaking the record, and not implementing safety rules and considerations.
I want to see the Rimac Nevera give it a go.
@0:01 - the reaction from the steward on the right, says enough about the launch 😧
Isn't the batmobile (radmobile or whatever it is called) electric anyway?.. I mean I can't recall any moment where it sounded like a gas guzzler in any movie.
Absolutely unreal 👏
Would give a new meaning to "being in the draft"...
.
That's not a car.. it's a rocket with wheels!
Batman inside - mind boggling fast - awesome sound, magnificent car.
Why no one ask what a fan car is? It's an electric car so y'all already know that it's not gonna make it.
NFKNBLVBL
Was that a Tesla? 😏
OMG, that was crazy...
That run sucked me in and I couldn't stop watching. I'm a fan now.
I can’t imagine how fast it feels. With gps mapping and traction control, it may cause a black out.
I want to see AI drive that thing as fast as possible!
Zdecydowanie lusterka nie są mu potrzebne
Thought I was watching it in fast forward! Wow.
Nuts!
Holy moly do u see the air wake creating suction
Batmobil 🙃
Wow! The new Dyson looks pretty slick
Look at the barriers; they’re absolutely unsafe
Wow
wth happened here
That's ridiculous
EVs are the kings of hillclimb and that’s the only type of racing they’ll dominate in for years to come, at least until battery’s can become more energy dense
Comical to say the least. But well done nonetheless.
HOLY MOLY.
the launch tho...
Why would you need rear mirrors on that thing anyway??
Just a fad ....
Sounds insane. What were the G's on pull away and each corner?
I hate the electric car, but this machine is awesome.
omg its the batmobile :)
Let’s be real! If that thing crashed, those hay bays are not going to save anyone😂
Go speed racer .
Is it just me or is this one seriously ugly car, it goes great
Big RC car.
Outstanding, but also frightening. You wouldn’t like to lose one of the fans in the middle of a corner, and considering how much they are stressed, this is definitely something to consider.
Sjukt
Wow
that thing sounds wicked fast!
That balls of steel, fml insane run!
Can’t really comprehend what I just witnessed
Whats funny is if this is the future when they stop to pit, they wont be putting race fuel in, theyll be plugging in extension cords to charge em. Lol 6 hour pit stops
I bet the red bull x1 could beat this!
What?
Can go as fast as it wants and I couldn't care less if it doesn't have the growl of an engine. Electric is boring.
The end of internal combustion engines.
Fan...tastic
The top 10 will be silent in a few years time.....sigh
That is fast.
This thing is terrifying. Also still cooler than electric cars.
I mean. im a Mechanic. or atlest i was. And i did get into this With all the Smell and Sounds and i loved it!! but oh Boi Electric is just the Future ^^ no regulare engine can ever compare to electic. not even the New AMG 1. and i totlay love the AMG 1. thats a beast ^^
Absolutely insane, looks like the video was sped up. Just wow…
Now if you could make those gears sound like a flat 12 screaming,  you'd have something!! FJB!
Real Life Speedracer
I wanna see a race between this and the Volkswagen track car
This will be Glorious at Pike's Peak! But, the Air does get Thinner, so Downforce might lessen? Still my Favorite Car at Goodwood! Excellent engineering, and looks the part as well!
In order to have a powerful aerodynamic effect, Speirling is shaped like a Batmobile. It only takes 1.35 seconds to accelerate from standstill to 96 kilometers, and the top speed can reach 241 kilometers. Each metric ton can be allocated 1,000 horsepower. The power of the car comes from Nengyuan Technology (E-ONE MOLI ENERGY CORP) 60kWh ultra-high power battery, supplemented by McMurtry's unique fan technology can provide up to 2000 kg of downforce. Before 2022, McMurty is still a small start-up factory in the international supercar market. After the Goodwood Festival of Speed, the Speirling with the Molicel logo of E-ONE MOLI ENERGY CORP shocked the world and attracted much attention.
Rc car
Lordy!
I hope this car ends up in some racing game for us mere mortals to drive. Now that would be insane!
Looks amazing at 2x speed
Looks like the nurburgring and pikes peak are next... Amazing and they want it road legal 😜
I built electric radio controlled cars when I was a kid, and always wondered why they didn't scale them up. I later realized the battery tech wasn't there yet.... But it is now 😃
Fan-tastic
all i can think of is when woody from "toy story" lit that rocket with buzz to catch up to that moving van.
no one cares about DHL  The amount of downforce on this car is INSANE...
Crazy 🔥
Fast? Sure. But I'd still rather watch and drive any slower v8, straight 6, 5, 8, v10, v12 vehicles over that hair dryer any day.  Soulless little slot car racer on 4 wheels. Ain't nothing spectacular about it.   Long live fossil fuels
For the money.   It's junk.
Still slower than the Escudo
Who needs million dollar f1 cars when u have this
I though the video just a short highlight, turns it’s the whole run!
who needs traction control when you are glued to the pavement
Faster than the add they made me watch
TF Did I just watch??????????? Wow
What are the G forces on those turns?
I don't care how fast it is. I would much rather watch a gasoline powered supercar any day over one that sounds like a child's electric control car.
I went to the settings button to change the video to normal speed and see the real speed of the car on the track, but to my surprise the video was already at normal speed. Incredible!!!
we're only a few steps from star wars pod racing
He is the speed.
Scat-Mobile! 😂 🤣
An F1 car would do quite well but it wouldn't beat the McMurtry.
Wow!
I was standing just past the start line and couldn't believe the speed at which this thing whooshed past like a near silent rocket. Left open mouthed!
SCALEXTRIC
🤣🤣🤣mental
Have no words, absolutely ridiculous and breathtaking! But to drive it that fast on such a narrow track is as impressive as the car itself, unbelievable drive by Max Chilton!
Beautiful track. And the car wow.
Me
Looks like a Tim Burton era Batmobile in real life.
The car is incredible but the drivers skill is what makes this remarkable !
Sounds like the loudest dog box😂
That doesn't even feel like a car. It feels like a spaceship.
The car has 4,000 lbs of vacuum powered by a turbine engine and push forward by electric motors. The vacuum engines should not be allowed. it reminds me of when  magnetic slot cars came out in the 70s. The car never flew off the track. Just hold the controller at full throttle and watch the car zing around the track.  Also reminds me of the male born swimmer that  competes in woman group. the records or times should not count unless it's in a trans group. There needs to be a vacuum cleaner car group for this car to complete in.
all very clever and fantastically impressive, but.. I just don't get excited by the sound of electic motors whining compared with old skool engine noise. The future maybe, but dull as...
Crazy that it launches so hard being only rwd! Yes I know the fans, but still insane!!
I remember the time when people said electric cars will never come very common because people love the sound of roaring motor. LOL
impressive
I thought it was a "fast forward" clip.
Man, video looks like it's on 2x, what the F was that??
Does it come in black?
I want to see how this would do in a real race like the 24 hours of Le Mans
this is so insanely fast; it makes me wonder if those hay bails would protect any of the spectators if it crashed.
Can someone explain the aerodynamics behind the uncovered top front wheels? I've been intrigued since I don't recall anything in the like two years ago
FAN (with 2 meaning)  ;=))))
pivotal
Does it have some type of fan ground effect suction to keep it hooked up? I remember they experimented with fan suction on the f1 cars back in the 60s and 70s that they banned because it had an unfair advantage
Now that is what I call real Scalextrics!!
Holy.....that was fast
Wow let THE STIG have a go 💪😱
McMurtry have my respect, clearly know what they're doing.
I wonder how quick it would complete the top gear track.
That starters reaction at the beginning:)
Added bonus, is that it cleans the track as it does its run. 🤣
The crowd saw fast cars all day, but you could still hear their reaction when this fan car came past! I want to see/hear one now!! 🏎💨
I've watched this 10 times. Still seems like CGI.
how is this event still in this form? no way this is any way near save for spectators
I thought the  VW ID.R beat that record a couple of years ago? Only less than a second slower than this car.
A long time ago people laughed and thought you'd be mad about the idea of electric cars...... If only they see it now.
"Eat my dust" just got a new daddy.
This could easily break the Nürburgring lap record - if the battery would last one lap...
Makes you wish for a Unlimited class. F1 is to controlled "let the engineers free!"
Dam it almost looks fake
Km/h?
I'm pretty sure cars in the late 80s and early 90s ran ground effects like this for a few races before they were banned
Is this even a car? It looks like a rocket powered gokart and I think it is amazing. I’m also pretty sure that if you add wings, you can fly to the moon.
Man that guys fast!
gimmethesoundofa22bnotthewhineofthatthing
Thank you.
Electric racing is the future!
What if this is the prototype batmobile
When Batman goes to Goodwood!
mad car, can't wait to see it crush the 24h LM race!
World's fastest vacuum cleaner. bar none
That looks pretty much the same as the old Adam West Batmobile when they would speed up the footage to show speed just without speeding up the footage.
holysmoke
23 yr old record shattered by over 2sec!! Impressive.
If only DHL moved this fast. Better yet, if only DHL fkn moved at all!!!
Modern EV technology matched to 1972 Canam Chaparral tech makes for amazing history. Next Pikes peak?
Rimac and Chaparral 2J made a baby 😝
Looks like there's a new Batman movie in the works with Warwick Davis as the Dark Knight
Could have went under 39, if his balls didn't weigh so much
Even fast cars look slow on video due to the camera movement and zoom. This still looks fast. It must be wild in person
When ur wife leaves you so you build a monster
Let's see it compete in a 24 hour Lemans.  The problem with (still) electric cars is that the range and time is not there yet.  One has to plan extra days to account for the charging time, therefore your range is much shorter.
This isn’t a car, it’s a jet
is this car electric
The only fun to watch electric car. Ever. The rest is boring junk.
Next time this race is somebody put little mounds of different colored powder out on the track.
Incredible
I swear I thought it was a game on tv first. Jeeezzzz I have never ever seen anything like that in my life. Fassstttt
That thing looks like it’s terrifying to drive
I truly hate everything about how car looks. But no disputing, its incredibly fast.
It looks like the video is speed up
Yup, but banned from F1 for "reasons" lol. I'd love to see an in care only version of the run.
Rather ugly car goes very fast.
Holy acceleration.  The balls it must take to run a lap that fast.
Reminds me of a TVR for some reason. Must be the fenders.
Now let the 919 break the record again
Gee willickers batman
Going to have to look this up. Fan car, as in a fan in the chassis creating suction like the ground force F1 car of the 80's that was banned for its grip advantage?
If I were Batman, this would be my Batmobil!
Zippy
This lap is insane. Sounds like a jet engine
Was that actual speed? My eyes says the film is sped up. But my brain says I hope not.
It's time to cancel the TT I'm afraid.
Shocking!
Sounds just as exciting as a petrol motor……………….
its mental in it.. It tok of like it wasen't even standing still
its sped up lol
Still in my heart have to say   Nick in the f1 V10 will be the best memories ever   That sound and commitment, and as Nick said he could have put a bit more in
😳
It’s fast and all that but I don’t see any cup holders? 🥱
It literally scared the guy during the launch and that guy has seen so many cars. would love to see this at the nurburgring soon
Can barely see the thing it's so fast.
Wow!!👌
To slow
Did the rear drive catch on fire, or was that vapor trail?
That's more explosive than my pressure cooker.
Pikes Peak or Nurburgring?
Warpspeed
I would love to know how a current F1 would time, this record is very old, yet it has stood for so long (F1 were banned) what could be achieved??
It’s like the old Knight Rider episodes. Looks sped up✌🏻Unreal..
There was a race car back in the 60’s I believe that used a fan to create artificial downforce. The Chaparral 2J I believe. As far as this, the speed is amazing, but without the sound of an engine, something is just missing. It’s like watching an rc car.
I hate electric cars but this was incredible to watch! The speed it moved at was almost cartoonish!😳😎
Wow🔥🔥🔥🔥
Doesnt matter if its the fastest, it look like a midget car or a suppository
The start officials reaction sums it up
Thats scary
Amazing! That's some serious power.
Holy Balls.
No other car looks this fast up goodwood.. it’s just bonkers
Why is this jet flying so low?
Fake
Someone painted the Michael Keaton Batmobile gray and took at the Goodwood and set a record!
This thing is absolute bonkers
No no no no! Cars moving that fast, that quickly are supposed to sound loud and raucous!!!🤣😉
😳😳😳😳
Keerriced !!!!!  The Batmobile wins Goodwood !
is it speed up video ?
This might be one of the most frightening cars I’ve ever seen 2022 Batmobile
Wow
Next Amazon needs these cars to deliver faster
it mooves like aliens
it cant be true . i must see it to believe it .
Deeaaaammmmm that was fast, but not faster than me last night🤣🤣🤣
This isn't a car, it's a rocketship!
I love how the guy looks so calm at the beginning when he's probably hitting 10gs of force
That thing is effing bonkers and it looks like its got an afterburner. Where can i steal one?!
-=WHOOSH=-
It's the bat car. Just imagine it black.
f1 no way
Now play this video at the original speed 😂
Fast...but boring. Sorry, but i need that lovely sound of an powerfull engine <3
But it doesn't go "vroom". We can't possibly have that.
When I'm driving to the supermarket and I only have 5 minutes left. 🏎
Baita tocada gurizada.
would be nice to see a combustion engine car with fan... like Chaparral
so this is what f1 would look like if the gits in suits didn't constantly suppress innovation
Wow la verdad es que se ve que anda fuertísimo nunca había visto uno igual
So fast it was hard to believe I was watching on normal playback speed.
Scalextric.
I wonder if it'll still be this fast in a full track.
W●W!
Uau!!!! Incredible!!!
Why on Earth wasn't there a Renishaw logo/sponsor on there?  Sir David McMurtry's engineering business, co-founded in 1973 based on his invention of the touch trigger probe.  Still British-based design and manufacturing, World-class products for the global manufacturing industry and based in Gloucestershire 👍
Get it to pikes.
immaculate
Trust the steward's reaction when the car launched off the start. He's seen plenty of fast cars but this is on a whole other level.
its one of those things you can watch on repeat and not quite grasp what you are *actually* looking at.
Wait. I missed that. Can you start again?
Sounds like a broken record
Formula 1 is dead
You can literally see how planted that thing is to the ground :o It looks like it's on rails.
Why am I feeling like a McFlurry now.
Porsche 919 hybrid evo: "challenge accepted."
Aero
Yooo it's sounds like an airplane fly by
Incredible! Did he have a practice run? Serious commitment
I think there is a line that speed is not important if you can hear the engine and shifting. IT’s incredibly fast, but is it still exciting?
What did I just witness!
The way that thing goes it actually looks like the silly sped up footage of K.I.T.T. from Knight Rider in Super Pursuit Mode! Awesome speed!
It looks like it's based on a Morgan.
yawn. my food mixer sounds more interesting. I don't care what time he's achieving, it has 0 soul.
Daaamm that looks like the freaking batmobile in action
WHAT ON EARTH DID I JUST WITNESS???!!!
What engine is in this car ?
crowd approved 👌.
Now try Pikes Peak ...
Check out the 1978 Brabham F1 Fan car.  Same idea.
unnatural!
When your girl calls to say her parents aren't home
Chaparral built a fan car for Can-Am back in the day, which was quickly banned because the cornering speeds were too high, and it of course would go out of control if the fans failed. Later one Brabham built an F1 fan car that only saw one race and then was with drawn.
I have never seen anything move that fast, outside or inside a track. Genuinely astonished.
Why ain't Goodwood on Assetto Corsa Competizione as an extra DLC, Think of the people who would pay few qiud on a Goodwood DLC.... I've always wanted to go to Woodwood, But the ticket cost ect is too expensive for me, It's bad enough I'm struggling to find money for a new PC to further my sim racing channel, I'm getting pretty fast now, Got fast times on the Nordshliefe my little channel will show you my pace on the Nordshliefe, 1st place most the time on the online Nordshliefe lobby.....
Electric... 😏
That launch!  Like a jet off an aircraft carrier!
I thought the video is fast forward
Why is there an angry cat onboard?
I guess a series of these cars would be possible as the drivers would be protected from the car in fronts fan by their windshield.  Would be super fast racing where corner speed is everything!!
Unreal.
Yawn. EVs are so boring. Would have broken into the 37s with a ICE powerplant and the fan.
It sounds amazing!    Similar to the sound of the land speeders of star wars!
Amazing! Does this beast work like the old Chaparral 2J?
This is what real life speedrunning looks like lol
That almost looked unreal as it was so fast.😳
Everybody loves a fan car.
C'est une fusée!!!
I've never seen an F1 driver leave so much time on the track, that could've been way 39 seconds. Look at how wide he is of the main wall about 2/3rds up the track. I bet Button who was sitting there watching and waiting could've stepped in that and done the same this go.
when will it get taken to pikes peak?
Looks like the next Batmobile if I ever saw one!
The future looks fast
HOLY SMOKES BATMAN.  Everyone knows you have the coolest toys but DAMN!
Say what you want about electric cars, but no-one can deny they are fast
This doesn't even look real. The way it moves looks so fake, but it's not, it's real. Mental.
The thing that irks me most about this video is the massive number of bot comments. What's that all about?
I wanna see this thing on Spa and The Ring. Records are going to be shattered.
This should be the next batmobile
The flash in auto form.
I have never seen anything move that fast before.
I was at the start line when this happened. Never ever have I seen something take off the line as fast as this... Not even at Santa Pod... Gives the saying "corners like it's on rails" to a whole new level...
Cool, whats a fan car???🤔
I want this car in the worst way. Fell in love with it during the live stream.
I really want to see this car to crush every circuit time record
this car has to be in the next Batman Movie
This car deserves to be Top Gun on the road🏎🏎
Fulminare
That thing looks like a fggin‘ missile! Goes like one, too.
Seems like the video is being scrubbed in 2X.
Sped up (looks like it)
Ridge Racer called and it wants its car back
I felt sick just watching that
what an absolute monster!!! and it works!!!!
I would love to se the race telemetry from this run, the lateral g's must be incredible.
0-60 in 1.4seconds that is unreal wow
Spéirling!
Absolutely amazing, but two comments: It looks faster because it's so tiny. And a lot of the time was gained on the start due to the fan-generated downforce. With a rolling start, a softer set-up or current smooth tarmac, Quick Nick would have been equally fast. Still amazing - the future may not be so bleak after all 😉
When batmans misses says her parents aren’t at home
Will you petrol burning ingrates finally admit it’s over for the combustion engine? I mean common there is no street legal vehicle that comes close! gas powered or not!! This is the final nail in the preverbal coffin for the ICE !!
They need to add this car in gran turismo 7
Imagine Nurburgring!
I like how even the man stating right next to it got jump scared by that take off lol
Oh my goodness!! Impressive driving!!
That thing is moving like a UFO!
The marshall on the right at the start has a great reaction
This is what I imagine the Batmobile would move like IRL
Almost sounds like a sonic boom passing by.
Road surface cleaner
I wonder how it would perfom against the 919 at the Nürburgring....
thats like watching a rocket car, how on earth is it getting that much grip?????
Have these instead of Formula E
🤩
Nggk sabar pengen liat mobil ini di pertarungkan sama mobil terbaik F1 (redbull)
Holy sh*ttttt.........👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
FAST......BUTT UGLY.
I know...Tom Cruise was driving this at Mach 10, right? 🤔
I can't wait to see where this technology takes racing
Thing is on a rail.  I'd buy 3 of these over 100 Teslas...
Yeeeaaahhh, it's really "difficult" breaking the record with torque vectoring and the computer driving, isn't it? Other than turning the wheel and taking his foot off of the brake pedal, what did the driver actually do? He was but a passenger in this... thing. It can hardly be called a car. It's a glorified, automated taxi cab. ALL HAIL "PROGRESS"!!!
Amazing! And I hate evs!! ..also very brave driver
I thought you could go this fast only in the game Gran Turismo lol
Does it come in black? Like Batman's black? Asking for Bruce
Now that's an art of true engineering ❣️❣️
When you wanted to make the Batmobile, but didn't want to get sued 🤷🏾‍♂️😎🤣
Next: pikes peak ;)
Very cool but it is comically small lol. Like if someone drew one of those cartoon versions of a batmobile where the car is like 2/3 the size and looks squished, this is the real life version lol
The best ev sound ever
This literally looks like the 60s batmobile, like when they sped up the tape to make it look jet-car-fast. His thing is unreal. Absolutely fantastic
I think is jet car, So fast
Can't believe do that with spectators that close and with hay bails lining the track
If an accident occurs in this speed range, the audience will be damaged, so caution is required in the future.
That thing launched like a fighter jet 😳
This is what I imagine the batmobile would be like IRL
Modern day Chapparral 2J
I just want one
wait...WHAT ?
WOW
How was that in normal speed??! Holy crap 😳 🤯
Dang! He is flying
Holy smokes that was awesome!  I wonder if that was water used to cool the electric motors coming out the back
Can't let the F1 cars go flat out because "muh safety" but meme car can do whatever it takes to break the record? Rather a bit sus then init bruv? Brits can't even argue because EVs are a protected class  and they will go to jail for hate speech.
This looks like the footage was running at 3X speed. Absolutely bonkers.
What was the record before this?
Can we get a series with these mfs please
Whhaaat did i just see?!
Not sure why there's so much "hate" over the sound (or lack of) from an EV because THAT thing sounded fabulous to my ears. It was close to the sound of a turbine.  I think this makes two major sprint-style events where the EV has become the new leader. Pikes Peak is the other.
Makes everything else look prehistoric .
What kind of power train does this thing have? Looked like some kind of exhaust coming out the back but sounded electric 🤔
Well nothing to say 👍
this is me after taco bell
Please, don't put on fast forward. 🔥🔥🔥
I hate electric cars, but I'll give credit where credit is due. Epic run! 👏🏽
I spoke to the designer last week, he said they had to design a spherical well at each side of the driver's middle position. These "wells" had to be able to carry a 50kg weight, in the shape of a wrinkly beach ball, in perfect comfort on both sides, while not adversely affecting the weight distribution. Remarkable achievement!
I would MUCH rather watch a 5 minute race, with 10 of these cars, than a formula E race.
why were a lot of the cars limited for safety and this one wasn't? or did I hear wrong?
Now take it to Pikes Peak and smash the record there
Batman
Man, that thing moves!
My friend Chris said he would have finished in 39 seconds flat.
THX1138
Hm. this could have ended badly.
As impressive as the speed is, the lack of engine noise is what makes this meh to me 😅
It looks like a slot car. It's 1980s we sped the footage up fast.
0:01 WHAT A FIGHTER JET!.This is one of the lower reaction times I've seen in my entire life
Sucks.
Did you notice that the Gen 3 Formula E car Broke Down on all it's attempts? There's no way they wanted to be humiliated by this beast.
That’s epic , congratulations top work 👌
Not bad for an appliance on 4 wheels.
RC car but drivable that thing was skating all the way through
You speeded the film up
Does it come in black?
is it also available in black?
That's what happen when gas turbine join electric engine! This car is a dynamite also dynamically... Wow... Way over the the others
I was there watching when this went past, I didn't know about it at the time, but was so gobsmacked at the speed it went past, I decided to Google what it was as I wasn't quite sure it was actually a car!
He was flying . I here name thee lil stinger
They finally have the tech to build full cars that drive so fast for scale that they look like RC cars.
Beast
looks like this wide is speeded x3 :D
The future of speed is electric, without a doubt
That’s not a car that’s a rocket ship. That launch is bonkers too.
That driver has some big kahunas
They got the bat mobile flying
We have formula E, now it’s time for formula weeeeeeeeee
YEE-HAW!!!
Would love to see the telemetry on this run! Crazy quick!
Its looks like the video is sped up...wow
Some say that car is still charging.... Do you run half of the race one day charge the cars at night and then run the other half.... Do you charge it with a generator
Finally, proof people look at cars banned from F1 for innovating so hard it's no longer fair and implement their technology elsewhere
Goofy ahh car
That’s fast 💨
Congratulations Bruce Wayne!
Hate to put a wet blanket on this car but… the active suction aero was tried in the 60’s in America. It was banned in racing. Same as the Chapparal high downforce cars were banned. And F1 had active exhaust aero that was similarly banned. Active aero is a bit of “cheating.”
Holy crap....it's like watching a video game in fast forward. Unreal
I have never seen anything in my life accelerate as fast as this
Don't think haybales were goin to stop it if it left the track.
Even on that short track it was a hundred times more interesting than watching an entire F1 race.
The guy on the start line startled by how fast this car took off! 😆
I see a massive accident in the future involving many spectators. The run off areas are slippery grass and there's a few hay bales to absorb the vehicle. Probably need to wind back the speed a little.
This is a rocket !!
Where sound?
Geezuz...I had to double check if the playback speed was 2x! 😱
Smoke him! You know when something serious is going on when there is a "smoke" all the time on the back of a electric car.
Where was the hill??
What just happened???
It's so small and out of proportions, it's a cute cartoon car.
“Gotham needs me.”
Disgusting
Averaging over 100 mph from a standing start, crossing the finish line at 149 mph.
Just rip 8 seconds from the 20 year old record in comparative silence!
very-expensive-vacuum-cleaner
The Batman car.. 😂😂😂
looked like he was at the finish line before the dust had a chance to settle  ..
This McMurtry just fucks off
That’s the fastest I’ve ever seen a car take a corner. That’s the coolest electric car I’ve seen yet. It’s like a downsized Batmobile
It sounds like K.I.T.T. in super pursuit mode AND I'M ALL FOR IT
"Atomic batteries to power.  Turbines to speed."
Baba baba baba baba batmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan
I want to see fan car racing
You know, there is some 19 year old saying his remap fiesta st is as fast as this.
This is the long term future of Formula One!. Imagine the sound of 30 of these engines at once. It will be like the screeching banshee V10 ICEs from back in the day.
I'm an trasfer, inline 4 motorbike rider. I love all ICE cars.  But the EV whine and instant 100% torque I hope will power us in the future. In addition to my ICE toys 😉
The fastest toaster in the world!
It is more an inverted helicopter.
……. Absolutely insane. Amazing machine. Amazing driver.  Byooootifal!
2 ads get you a 👎 dislike
I'd like one in black please 🦇
That car is amazing, makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up just watching it. Imagine driving it lol fun fun fun
This little rocket runs around the track like its sonic on the xbox . 🚀🚀🚀
can you even imagine how expensive it would be to ride a giraffe through the city power plant
Bro Zoomin
This look like the batmobile from the older movies. Definitely goes fast too! DC and WB, please put this in the next batman movie 🙏
And the English and Italians keep on building petrol dinosaurs ... well they still have 13 years to rehab, then it's finally history.
Looks like Bottas driving lol
Now THIS is pod racing!
How this driver managed keep focused control, is truly the amazing part 😳
That was cartoonish speed
Wow...I see why It's outlawed... the fan sucks the car to the ground..Looks like you can drive all out in every corner...🤣😂🤣😂... That's insane!!
Now that, is how you SELL A CAR!!
It is actually a full length car. But, at those speeds light is compressing in front of it making it look shorter.
F1 cars are not allowed to run timed runs outside their circuito! The record lap of 41 seconds was w0 years ago....F1 cars today are faster than 20 years ago...son yeah! Stop bitching...
Nunca mejor dicho un misil..!!
Thafuck was that!??
This should be the official F1 safetycar. It could also dry up the track after rain.
The new Bat Mobile
The reaction of the guys in the first seconds are hilarious
Is this safe for the audience? 😂
Future
This makes my brainballs hurt!
BONKERS!
Oxiii...😳😳😳
Super cool and crazy fast from all aspects !! Thanks for the clip now I will do further research on this creation,the evening saved‼️
sounds like a jet lmao
That was incredible!
This is what you expect “fast” to look like. 🤩
Ok someone call Bruce Wayne and see who he let borrow the batmobile....
It looked like K.I.T.T. from Knight Rider in Super Pursuit Mode, but the film wasn't sped up.
holy crap
FE should sound like this.
That thing is REAL?
holycrap that launch is out of this world
That's one fast vacuum cleaner.
That's literally mind boggling, it's like watching one of the old 80s racing movies on fast forward, that is an insanely fast machine that grips as well, won't be beat anytime soon.
This is what K.I.T.T.'s Hot Pursuit Mode suppose to be LOL!
The gasps, applause and gleeful laughter from the crowd as this tiny batmobile whooshes by tells the entire story
this should Batman's new vehicle
This is insane! Are you sure this is not edited and 3x speed lol. Hats off to Max Chilton for being able to react and drive that fast...I am not sure if this will ever be beaten.
Wow
What an I even looking at?! Where’s the link to an overview of what makes this car blow like the wind?!
quandale dingle ahh car
I watched it at .75 speed and it looked more realistic. Suction fans are banned by most racing organizations and it's easy to see why. They totally change the complexion of racing. Still, I want to see the fan car race at Pikes Peak. I believe it would still be legal in the Unlimited class.
WHAT WAS THAT 😳
Holly cow!
Reminds me of the Volkswagen IDR run up Pikes Peak! Phenomenal run 👏
That thing made every other car look like they were going slow motion.  Crazy beast of a car!
This thing sounds pretty cool!
Phenomenal 😯
Wow...just wow...literally like watching scalextric...mind blown..
I want some of their batteries for my electric bike….wow!  Current draw must be enormous!
JFC!!! 😲
Bonkers!  I can't stop watching this.
The batmobile has cometh!!! Yes!!! Bruce wayne Secretly testing new batmobiles right in front if our faces
Love the reaction of the two marshals!
"By 2030...DHL has committed to invest €7 billion in green innovations for a sustainable future"        I assume you are being sponsored? LMAO
this is real????????😱😱😱😱😱😱 so fast.
The Eco-friendly Batmobile!
To the batcave!
Rule Britannia!!! 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Just proves Small things can be better that large things 🍆😂😂😂
Was wandering, is the battery big enough for pikes peak?
Next, magnetic rail and rocket booster?
That's the Batmobile.
This is not a car: it is a bomb! Congratulations to those who designed it! And hats off to the one who had the guts to drive it!
"Why!" Completely pointless????
That's Batman's old car, he's got a new one now but didn't bring it to the show.
Absolutely amazing how these cars fly on the track. But for me, Its not the same as hearing the roar of a V12 or the whistle of a big turbo. These electric racing cars idea is nice, but I hope these other ones dont get replaced or something like that
New Forza Horizon 5 car...
Is this a colored 1920s silent film?
ev are not a joke anymore
Respect. But. Sounds not like the Huayra R. 🤷🏻‍♂️ But,really respect for the driver,awesome. 👍
We want to see it on nurnburgring
Amazing British achievement!
If this is the future of racing. I'm all for it.
I was stood right by the track, next to the Main Bridge by the Future Lab area, when this took place. It went past so quickly I honestly didn’t see it. In fact it sounded like one of the Red Arrows had flown by us! Such an astonishing run by Max Chilton after he had just 1hr sleep the night before. This car is pushing the limits of not just performance but driver capability
Did it have a jet drive in addition to being electric?
Smithereens!
Warp speed Mr Sulu, yes captain......ENGAGE!
ouch
Batman eat your heart out. Some machine though
This is the real speed...
Batman
Like it or not, EVs are the future of racing.
Just found back my RC car
It just absolutely ate up every single corner
never seen anything move that fast
je prefere une Panoz
i really like it but the car is too small i mean ridiculously small , it has a forced vacuum so is inviable and illegal , this guys spend too much money just to have fun , it s not a fail but its a no again
The left men by 0:01 , soo great move !!!
Me when the diarrhea hits.
I have a suggestion.  Let Formula E change the car to this.  This car wants to be looked at.  Because Gen 3 is a parody of the car in appearance...
Wow!
Sounds like the world's fastest milk float! :D
That thing is *insane!* It sounds amazing, like a jet-car. Being able to take corners at high speed must surely be the key to super-quick laptimes. I suppose it would be unforgiving as a race car though. Are fan cars banned from hillclimb competitions? I just read that it's limited to 241kph. Imagine it's full potential!
Seeing this car in real life was the most surreal thing ever it literally sounded like a jet
Thought it was on 2x speed. It wasn't. Wow!
They really need to take that thing to different tracks. Who wouldn't want to see what the new track record was going to be... IJS
I thought my vid was on 2x playback that was freaking fast
I'm curious about the G figures
Congratulations! I guess we could do the same time 😜
Need to fit a fan to F1 cars people might start to watch it again as it's now BORING
The acceleration and downforce is mental!
When Bruce Wayne goes to Goodwood...
"Electric"
I was here 3 hours after the video was posted PogU
Probably the best moment in GoodWood history… And there’s been hundreds of them…
Is that the Batmobile?!
An F1 car has to be doing over 150mph before it is generating the amount of downforce this has at 0mph.
This is the first time I have seen a car on tv going as fast as it actually is in real life! That thing set off like a stabbed rat! In fact thats what it should be called: The McMurtry Stabbed Rat!
this is so quiet, actually Chilton could hear the crowd. But he was faster than sound.
i like how it's an EV, but still has the gearbox whine.
Most fun and efficient road cleaner
and the second Lap ?
For those who do not know, this thing generates about 2000kg (4400lb) of downforce at a stand still, and about 2250kg (5000lb) at 240kph (150mph). Thats all from the ground effects caused by that extra fan sound you here. Based on the ideas of the Chaparral 2J and Brabham BT46B.
it's the bucken Fat Mobile - on roids!
Any plans to take this thing to Pikes Peak?
One word,                    😳 EYES 😳
Super Pursuit Mode KITT
There’s not even an engine.  It just looks so fast the car took off before they could put the engine in!
Now hit the Isle of Mann.... 😁     Epic...
I didn't see it, what hapend? The THINGS nuts! Apparently it's the start of a new breed of vehicle.
Its a shortened batmobile.
speechless
This makes the Model S Plaid and Rimac look like power wheels toys 😂😂😂
1st time that I saw this video I thought they altered the speed to look faster......I was wrong.!
New lap record, and the track has been vacuumed clean! Bonus!
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.       !
This set the new record, and the record will never go back to a combustion engine vehicle.
this is the vacuum car? inspired in the chaparral?
When the coyote can steer the rocket
who wants to get rid of a bag of wood dust without anybody knowing?
Oh man I hope McMurtry will be racing at Pike's Peak, seeing this run for almost 8 minutes would be absolutely epic
I think I might have a problem. I’ve watched and re-watched this video far too many times for a neuro-typical person. 😂
That final shot of the front LED's barely seen amidst the dust is so intimidating and awesome.
Rocket.
chaparral tech
Bro what am I watching, this is incredible
That’s inhuman.
Friendly reminder that this is a RWD car and took off like it did at 0:01. THIS is the benefit of having a fan in the back. 2,000kg of downforce from a standstill.
waaaaaat
and this is a LUDICROUS SPEED!
Now that's an electric car
Pétition 🇫🇷 ♥️ 🇫🇷 contre l'expérimentation animale sur le site 30 Millions d'amis 🧂🐈  Savez-vous qu'il y a aussi des chiots & des chatons dans les labos ? 🙀
1980: In the future... cars will fly. 2022: CARS FLY!!
Amazing!
Scotty, we'll be going to warp speed.
K.I.T.T 2000 when was in super  pursuit mode
Anyone actually believe that those hay bails are going to protect the crowd from a car going at that speed? Amazing though.
So crazy it doesn't even look real
Imagine what time this would get on The Ring
Remapped 335d beats it any day.
Okay, NOW we can actually get excited about electric, Elon musk and his click bait 0-60 times are all show no go…this thing GOES!!!
This car actually looks cool, too. So many electric cars, hypercars, supercars...they all look the same.
23 second mark.  Those oohs and aahs just proves that if the car is fast, people will watch.  Regardless of methods of propulsion.
This truly is the future 🙌
genuinely looks sped up
I dont know, this car has no personality to it, its just there and broke the record
Meh.
Cool, they raced with the 90's batmobile!
When you realise The internal combustion engine is dead
The vacuum cleaner has lost it's dust collecting bag.
I honestly thought that they speeded up the film. That was nuts, that was insane
Or sincere apologies Germany for blowing you into the weeds ..🇬🇧😂🤣😂
Really makes a mockery out of FormulaE.
wicked
Wish I could see Ayrton Senna drive this car.
Nothing but an electric Chaparral 2J from over 50 years ago!  Yawn 🥱
0:25 that laugh from someone in the audience :D I feel like how that laugh sounds. What a cartoonishly fast vehicle!
It's almost F1 without rules.
that's got to hve torque vectoring to take those corners so effortlessly looking.
Reminds me of the VW IDR around the Nurburgring, except this has that jet looking bat mobile look.
Tie Fighter for the road!
Fast but this car looks wrong
Waldo's car from Little Rascals.
My eldest son and I were there on the Saturday this year. The run then was extraordinary, the Sunday run was off the scale! The Goodwood FOS is a wonderful event. This is the 3rd time for me and family. It is something we look forward to for months. Get there if you can.
I knew nothing of this car till the other day. At first I thought it was turbine powered or something. Nope, it's just a thousand horsepower EV skateboard being sucked to the ground. I want one.
Wow that was fast
The biggest part of the cars downforce is generated by the balls of this driver
Shut up cc lol
This would make the perfect batmobile
See the car in action over on my channel
Looks like the old Brabham BT46B trick is still working, right?
Fan cars are absolutely amazing this run is incredible and I've seen the previous record, I never imagined someone could have beaten it 😯
I was today years old when I learned that fan cars exist.
Here come the race car Sucker Fan bans ... again !!
I want one!
If TVR released a Batmobile... 😁
It's a rocket with wheels
this car has the abiity to beat the nurburgring nordschleife record
😮 hold my bag, back in a few secs
0:01 The guys reaction sums it all up.
This looked like a video game, wowowowo
Sublime
People keep saying that electric cars sounds like an rc car, this one does but damn this one goes like a rc car too.
I'm not a fan of electric cars, but this was   W   O   W    !
Kdkdkkdkd
First reaction: is this speeded up?
Wait, its a real car? 🗿
:-O
Watch the top ten times from this shootout to truly understand just how fast this thing is.
It’s a *bullet*
My Honda civic can do it faster!
That was just ridiculous O_O
Faithful Batmobile!!!
Rocket
One lap and battery off. Porsche 911 gt1  100 lap more .....
I honestly wanna see a series race these cars it would be very fun to watch them go around at speeds like this
So damn quick, I thought I was watching in 1.5x.
Sponsored by Wayne Enterprises. hahaha It looks, sounds and runs like something out of a super hero movie. Absolutely insanse!
Super fast car it's just not as interesting without a motor and qll the sounds that comes with one
Sir, can you upload the 4K version. I want to enjoy it on my big screen tv. thank you
look like old batmobile but shorter version :D
from those 1.6mil views I have watched this at least 1million times!
Wow, decimating the long standing run by Señor Heidfeld (in a car fighting him all the way) I do hope this car has the range for a Pikes peak challenge too.
DAMN THAT'S FAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Great Driver.  Don't put Hamster in that car or it will be upside Down at the end.  Some people will get this.   Some won't.  Too bad.
Very quick smooth start and damn fast
Battery capacity from 100-0 in 40 seconds
Dang that looks faster than f1.
Call it Jackson storm!
Insanely fast😮
That was epic
Trackmania PF level IRL
Wow, Dyson really went all out on the V22 airblade.
Why did that starter guy look like he was annoyed after the car launched?
electric ....boringggggggggggg
Imagine if this car appears in GRAN TURISMO 7.
!@ !
One word to describe this run 👍👍👍👍
Dubbed in clapping and gasps , sped up video . Why didn't they have Bigfoot driving .
Fastest toy car ever! Nice time though :o dammm
Wow the car is insane looks like it CGI but it's not it reminds me of driving the Red Bull car in Gran Turismo 6.
The world's fastest road sweeper is absolutely cracked! I would have loved to see that myself!
na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na      BATMAN!
Welp, one of the best 39 seconds of my life well spent. Congratulations Team McMurtry!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
schnell und dhl passt nicht zusammen...wenn ich rennwagen sehe denke ich eher weniger dran bald wieder beim nachbarn klingeln zu müssen um mein paket abzuholen
It's very appalling to see that many people undermine the power of investment and it's role in financial independence
First fan car was American, lol. Sorry UK
I thought I was looking at a Batmobil.
vaaaaccccuuuuuuuuuummmmmmm!!!!!!!!
Insane ⚡️
In essence, a fast vacuum cleaner 👍
wow so epic i like this car
Wie immer zum kotzen YouArschloch
Redbull X2010 successor right here and EV too.
Electric Ev’s are here, now, & the future. People who slate them - hate them for no valid reason & haven’t experienced them properly. They’ll say ‘but they sound rubbish’ or ‘they haven’t got the range’. These are all excuses for dinosaurs who won’t accept what’s here & coming & embrace it. In every vector space of driving EV’s are better than ICE. I sold my R35 GT-R 18 months ago for an EV & have never once regretted it. People hate change - get used to it, try it, embrace it, as you’ll have very little choice soon! Incredible run & EV tech showcase.
Why the f*** does that thing even have rear view mirrors?
So much dust on the track??
ePower 🦾
Mad!
Officer its stock :)
does Batman know you're driving his car ???
Electric pffft boring
Electric racing cars, fast but boring
Surely you mean he broke the Romain Dumas VW IDR hill record of 39.9s by which he only beat it by 0.82s, still a great accomplishment. Te future is electric.  Next target should be Romain's VW IDR Pike Peak Record.
😳😳😳👍
that car was few away from breaking the sound barrier
What is it, some sort of jet engine?! Completely bonkers!
OMG. That is insanely fast!!
Goddamn it’s going to cool to see cars like this crash in the future
Absolute rocketship....unbelievable acceleration 😯
You guys need better camera work!!!
That.  Launch. Tho.
Ok, take it to Pikes Peak next.
Fast
😍😍😍
Amazing run. They NEED to go to Santa Pod, it could set records on the 1/4 mile.
Looks like this will decimate the Nurburgring when given the chance
Wow! Awesome
I'm more impressed by Max Chilton's humongous balls to drive this car up the hill than the car itself, which is already insanely impressive.
Now I know how DHL delivers their most important packages on time
Impressionante
Hay bales?
The first thing I thought of when I seen this car take off was Batman from the early Sixties when the bat mobile came out of the bat Cave they sped up the footage to make seem like that bat mobile was moving real fast, but in this case it was real and it look so unreal I had to watch it over and over again just to sink in that I actually seen a car in real time move this fast, I am not surprised about anything anymore we will be seeing Alien life forms from another galaxy and I won’t even be shocked after seeing this😁
Don't forget
Mind blown.  I mean, sucked.  Ah, heck... why not both?  The car is crazy enough, and so is the driver!
Is that car electric?
Not bad, but it just doesn't have the personality of the 'Beast of Turin'...😄
visceral
OHHHHHHHMYGAHHHHHHHHHD!!!!!!!!!!    They need to show Batman jumping out of this thing!
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.            !…
Time travel is next...
Fast forward?
Anyone else find themselves smiling as they enjoyed watching this little rocketship?👏😁
Jim Hall would be proud.
Astonishing!! Hoorah!!
Appears to have an electric jet attached the rear
But very disappointing that a) no stopwatch, b) no exciting commentary to reinforce the achievement. Why?
I did this already but cool video
Best corner by far
I am youtuber હું youtuber છું (My SHORT video) (👑Jogmaya official king👑)
Dammmmmmmnn
It looks like they played it twice the speed.
Jim Hall would have been proud. Chaparral Chevy reborn
electric cars should not be allowed to compete against internal combustion engine machines,    its like men competing against women in the same sport?!
This thing has a power/weight ratio that most RC cars don't even have.
The section of the track for the record spanned 1890 meters,  yielding an average speed of 108 mph.  EDIT: updated track length from previous erroneous figure
So when is the in car footage going to be available?
It’s electric. No one goes to Goodwood to see a glorified golf cart. No one…sad.
FANtastic
I would love to see that car run the Nurburing short or long track.
Slot car performance finally scaled up to reality. Absolutely bonkers
All fine until someone crashes a contraption like this and you have another Mercedes at LeMans moment. The sheer mass of the battery packs.
😯
Batmobile
Madness! Absolutely mad how fast it is 😂👏🏻
Not an electric car. It's a straw/nuclear fusion hybrid. Nasty wall there at 0:27...
Formula E should take some notes
Waiting for Nurburgring
We will miss eargasm from cars.
lets go proto saber
Hear that? That's the sound of progress....
Da car doe
It’s like seeing a colour television for the first time, wow
That’s so fast it doesn’t seem real
if batman raced f1
It's so fast, the camera operators were having a hard time keeping up with it!
The definition of "pocket rocket" has been successfully updated.
Run like a flash I love this
Okay but how fast was it going?
All the gasoline fans: but but but…. It has no soul!
I've watched this run at least 10 times and it still looks incredible
Can we please get a racing series for these things?
I can't stop watching again and again⚡💨
The vacuum sound makes the car look like if it has a jet engine or som
If all electric cars sounded like this I might be tempted.
Sometimes a fast run looks slow and undramatic. This was insane
holy crap it looks like a rocket shooting into space or a missile. never saw anything move that fast haha.
Saw this in person most ridiculous thing I’ve ever seen
Like a miniturized Batmobile
I thought the film was speeded up!!
what was this car's top speed up the track?
J ´avoue très impressionnant pourtant je n’apprécie pas spécialement les sports mécanique bravo
back to the future is here baby!
Forza 8 is looking great!!
That's absolutely outrageous
This is truly spectacular! What a feat of engineering! Bringing it back to the UK 🇬🇧
It looked like Michael Keaton's Batmobile especially from behind. Amazing watching it blow the dust out of the track. I'll bet it has so much suction it could drive upside down.
The driver has ice in his veins
A quiet vacuum VS  An IndyCar
It looks like the footage is sped up 😂
Physics
That was memorable.
Faster than me saying WAZZAP!
Nice
looks like fans might be the future of downforce for performance EVs.
Tamiya?
Needs to  be  taken to the nurburgring
Why does it have a wing? We were told there was no need for a rear wing. A rear wing will rob it of top speed.
We need a new racing league. Nearly Unrestricted Electric Insane-Mobiles, like this. Just a few basic rules to keep things somewhat "safe" and relatively balanced.  Hillclimb/rally style I guess, on some large open track with many different configs, starting with nearly autocross experience to long straight runs with a few turns. Run all cars through all the track configs and award points per each like a mini championship, but with all runs done in the same day with restrictions on tuning/car setup so it's one setup for all kinds of tracks. Short distance, to reduce the need for battery packs and make the cars as light/fast as possible for short sprints.
Go Nurburgring
I’ve never seen anything so fast.
I hope it has a horn that does  the roadrunner  call. It deserves that horn!
Took off like the road runner "meep meep"💨
nine tenths faster than the ID.R. nine. tenths. on a 40 second run. unbelievable.
is that a 2x sped up replay of a "narrow-body" batmobile?
Godlike!
Epic!
Bro we have only tapped the surface of ev’s, think how much faster we are going to get in the years to come…
1st time I have to say that non EV race cars look like dinosaurs next to the EVs
This could pass as 2x speed video! Wow!
They need to get some Hoover or Dyson sponsorship ASAP.
What is that smoke behind the car??
Play it on 0,75x and it still looks normal
OMG, flashbacks of knight rider... but this is real
that launch alone is insane
I hope this come to gt7
It corners like a slot car. Amazing.
FAST
What is that thing 🙆‍♂️
I'm in the crowd at 0:23 going 'ooooh'
Incredible!
Thats shards of time coming out the back - not dust
Sounds like a jet, very interesting. Electric cars will dominate these acceleration events soon.
Yeah yeah, I remember the bat mobile from Batman 89 too
Goodness that is fast as speeding bullet & that is a game changer right there! 🙏
Now I want to see it drive inverted... It generates enough downforce, even sitting still, to make that theoretically possible...
Would've made it into 38s if that Dakar car didn't go first and put dirt over the whole track for everyone else to struggle on. Terrible decision to let that go first and mess up the track for everyone else
batman returns
It had freakin jet engine or what?! 🤯
WHOOOOOOSSSSHHHHH!!!!
The reaction of marshal tells all. A rocket launched in front of him.
Insane!!🤯🤯
james bond le man 24h on e formula require photo and possible upgrade to lvl super car as is supersound swuush sound and prefect for f1 front peek holders and side flaps movable as in brake and turn so this mechanism is super car element also tail should be doubled to extra suport swuush and big increased pop out speed  balancer standard ribs enlarged to goal is tail synergy with E formula end could expand to be more stabile and is just superb just by top peek expanding to have enough big spoiler movable flaps this is avionics in airtuneling and a bit super car tech actualy a tech close to star trek developed in air tunel so stream air is excellent and weight to as models is not heavy tech but it integrade all design and stun fast performance almost batmobil given to james bond car done so as am stuff definetly has flavour in it and fast future  worth off trying so
Car: launches Starter: what the
Put some wings and it will be a plane.
Is this at normal speed or x3 ? 👀
Incroyable !!! Il faudrait créé une course pour ce genre de voiture !! Ca déchire !
I slowed the video down, and it seems that the front tires are nearly breaking away from the rim on a few occasions.
In other news...the Tesla Roadster release date just got pushed back a decade!!
Although i hate electric this brings me that electric have a chance to be fast although we need to make it louder
😍😍😍😍😍
It even looks ultra fast on camera ...
If Pagani made the bat mobile.
Insane - no margin for error. Hit a barrier at those speeds and your organs are going to turn to mush when they deaccelerate into your chest/abdomen.
0:02 the marshall - it just f*cks off!
I have to keep watching that run. The car is awesome, the driver is awesome too IMHO. Seemed like a perfect run at warp speed
This is the first time the sound of an EV gave me chills
Wealthy Arabs right now "00"
I thought the video was on fast forward.
Gameing channel 😊😚
what we all want formula E to actually be like.. not those underpowered rc cars..ffs If F1 ever goes full electric this should be the type of speed and cornering we want to see as a bare minimum.
The first time I have seen a car looking like it's been fast forwarded 😂 Incredible
Please excuse my ignorance, but where’s the hill?
sonic the hedgehog xD
Interstellar
Sheesh he is brave to do that and skilled
Looks like the old batmobile a bit 😁
Podracer vibes
well, that sounded as exiting as... ummm... nope. It didn't did it?
viu
Vanishing Point going around corners. Neat.
First electric car that impress me!!!
das ist alles????
Ho-Lee-sheet !
Ok
woooooooooooooosh
Probbaly takes some huge balls of steel to drive but the again, probably be kicked off tbe team for excessive weight.
Literally live just down the road from where they built it 😎 Go on West Country!
Keep it
I didn’t see in the comments. But is that Valterri Botas? If so major props pushing this car to the limit during a season.
Unbeliable  racing car
The car is so fast & speed 🥰🤩.
The downforce is double the weight of the car so theoretically, it could drive upside down, right?
Looks like a toy   Moves like a Typhoon
Was that on fast forward 😳 cause you blink and you'd miss it.
This reminds me of watching Sammy Miller's "Vanishing Point" rocket car during the 1980s at Santa Pod. You know you've just seen something so extraordinary that it seems unreal.
Her: You Up Me:
Of course it's fast, they took the batmobile and painted it silver
🔥
Faaaaaaaaaaaucking fast. Damn
Underwealming milk float on roids
looks like a car from a burnout game
Wow this is fast  No Sound in Engine
Well played Max Chilton, you have surprised me.
Is this video playing at 2x speed already?
Wonder what it would do on the quarter mile at santa pod
Hotwheels in real life!
You know something is fast when even the stewards who LITERALLY see cars take off jump when this car takes off
Bonkers
Bonkers - no other word for it. Was at Goodwood this weekend and saw this historical moment - could not believe the downforce the fan is applying. Bonkers
Comme quoi, il était vraiment temps de changer de technologie !😀
sonic boom out the tail!!
Now that was worth the adverts
McMurty: We are going to build a car with 1000bhp, 2000kg of downforce that will obliterate the Goodwood Hill Climb Record People: LOL another small car company making big claims..... of course you will!!!!!! McMurty: Watch this -> -> -> People: (Something blurry) watch what?
¡¡¡COOL!!!.
Cartoonish looks, cartoonish speed.😲
damn.. so fast.. 🏎💨
Buy Tesla stock …. Four years ahead of everyone else for BEV’s
I have never seen a car accelerating like that. WOW!!! This really looks like a car Batman would drive.
That's literally some " 007 "stuff 💨
Tesla>>>>
Where the full onboard footage?
the swirling dust behind the car makes it look like the sound barrier can't keep up...
That car is fast and ugly. Ugly breaks it. I don't care how fast it is of its ugly to look at I don't wanna look at it.
an absolute rocket 🚀
EM OTHER  FERKER  !  😯
the reaction of that one guy at the start line! 😁 priceless...
Did DHL intend to impress us with that €7 billion figure? For a company that operates more than 200 airplanes and had a revenue of over €80 billion just last year, investing €7 billion over the next 8 years is not particularly impressive. Do better DHL.
We have reached a new level of racing fast in mankind.
This car could be used to test the Theory of Relativity. 😂
Guys visit our channel once please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
What the!!!
This is insane
This is blisteringly fast!!!
Bordel de Bordeaux 😮
00:00 The folks at  the starting line flinched a little when it started the race. That's how i knew  it was  going to be fast.
Little know fact but the Goodwood estate sunk 2 inches yesterday due to the excessive downforce of this monster
I was there it was the fooking fastest thing I've ever seen crazy speed.
“And then Max Chilton got this run…”
I'd love to show this to ancient Egyptian, Greek and Roman scientists. It's incredible.
Robin’s bat mobile.
Just glad he kept it on the track, that thing would munch its way through the bales towards the crowd very easily.
"when your gf Is at home alone"
That is the fastest street sweeper I have ever seen.
SMOKIN'!!!!!!!!!
Its a silver batmobile.
I wouldn't complain if f1 cars sounded like that!?
goddamn thats fast
This is Italian no matter how u look at it again and again thank you very much.
Please please please, I want to see how fast it will do Silverstone
I wonder F1 car could be faster if they would push it…
when its past curfew and you already have 4 missed calls
Manual gears+Gasoline and Electric? This should be countered as the same record?
Love the one guy at the start jumping spreading his arms like "wait where'd it go?"
I don't think  " wow " quite covers this. 😯
Wahnsinn ^^
Do NOT let Richard Hammond anywhere near this thing
The New Batmobile looks tiny but super fast!!
This doesn't even look real.
Every comment on this video is from people who have been there in person
Πως παει ετσι!!!! 😁😁😁😁Τι φαση!!!!!
Ev racing needs cars like this that fan brings a level of theater to an EV race car that previously they have been completely lacking.
Congratulations to McMurtry Automotive and Sir David McMurtry on their record breaking.  Your new car, the McMurtry Spéirling, is wonderful, surprisingly ultra fast, demonstrating the technological capacity of your company in the development of new electrical technologies, combining the best and most advanced current technologies with those of the past, such as the fan car Brabham Bt46B self-contained fan, designed by Gordon Murray, winner of the 1978 Formula 1 Swedish GP, when the great Niki Lauda won that race at Anderstorp.  With the reasonable dimensions of a Formula 1 car from the 1960s, evidencing that size is part of McMurtry's virtuous circle philosophy.  A small car is a light car, while modest frontal area limits drag.  The slick aerodynamics are helpful for forward motion and speed, which is aided by the low mass.  The fan increases the downforce.  Carbon fiber gives it rigidity, lightness and at the same time safety.  Now, Max Chilton (former Formula 1 driver and current IndyCar driver) made Goodwood history by shattering the circuit record at Goodwood Road & Racing's infamous Festival of Speed.  He did it aboard his McMurtry Spéirling electric car, with a time of 39 "08 for the 1,800 meters of said circuit, breaking the official record set by Nick Heidfield with a Formula 1 McLaren MP4 / 13.  This electric car could also break all existing records, in all the circuits in which it is presented.  The future is electric.
That car is insanely fast, the camera crew can barely keep up with it 💪
It feels like the video is being played in fast forward!
Insane speed!! What is the name of this little bullet on wheels? I want more!
Getting paid for working here was awesome. I'm not a car person atall but some of these cars were absolutely incredible
Geeeze that was fast.  Still not a fan of e-power.. but man they are fast.
Fast but boring. No soul, just a vacuum cleaner
That redefines fast. My head can't compute how it cornered like that.
It shouldn't count for the overall record it's not a combustion engine vehicle. It's bullshit
sounds like my slotcars in my videos 👍
Brutál electric power
How fast can it go?
Yes 🤟
They should change the name of their car. That's the only thing holding it back.
Mans defying laws of physics
This car makes me excited for the future of electric racing cars
Was im the only one going: „na na na na na na na BATMAN!“ the entire time of the video?
Formula-E needs these bad boys.
What a terrible name lol
I thought 'acceleration' was a rule, but this thing went 0 to infinity in just a moment. Crazy.
Props to the driver
Now watch it 2x slower. Still faster than that AMG Mercedes supercar wannabe
At the first glance it looked like a time lapse...but this thing obviously was REALLY!!! that fast!!!!! AMAZING!!!!
Make a two seater production version of this and it will sell faster than you can say the price. Awesome.
Bartender! A pint of your finest Heidfeld Bitter!!
Ok, adesso fai altri 50 giri di pista.
0:01 everybody shocked a little about how fast it launch lol
That mcFlurry is fast n creamy
This car’s sound so cool , just like people cheer and clap hands
Electric Power Baby
boooring, just put a RC car on the track, just as interesting
jajaja, que arrancada!!!... cogió por sorpresa a los comisarios jajaja
So it can go fast for almost 40 seconds ? ;-)
The innovation the designer put into this car, besides an electric motor, goes way beyond what anyone would have expected.  This design really is "thinking outside of the box".
I genuinely thought I had the video on 2x speed at first
Insane
Holy smoke, that's impressive!
People giving credit to the "EV" car as the record breaker have completely forgotten that this is a "FAN" car and uses technology already banned years ago in ICE racing. 🤦‍♂️
Goofy ahh car
That’s fast
YOU GOT THE JOB BUDDY  OMG 😲
Its fast and the electricity to power it is  52% gas , 18 % nuclear,  30% renewable  Solar during the day and when its windy. I like it .
Are you sure the footage is not sped up?
what a sound🤣
I blinked. What did I miss?
Now that's a pocket rocket...
We need to see 20 of these cars racing each other at full speed one day. I realize that it will be a very short race lol
That was impressive. But, can it drift?
This thing doesn't even compute... Incredible, I'm astonished
sound like F1 machine 😱
Speechless.
Notice the officials flinching at the start!
And still, it sounds boring.
0-60 mph in 1,3 seconds. What a bonkers car. Now i want to see what it can do in circuits that F1 runs and how close in laptime it can get.
And who says electric cars can't be _seriously_ freaking cool?
This sound is horrific. This is not motorsport. Motorsport has an engine in it which people can appreciate. This squeaky sound is just awful
is this a jet version for the street? wthell thats fast!
What a crazy launch start
i mean it was purely built for this run , this exact model at least.
It’s so fast that the footage looks sped up and only looks normal when you play it at 0.75x speed. Mad car.
I had to watch this like 10 times. That car is blistering fast.
Quite simply magnificent. Not sure how Max Chilton can fit into that cockpit with testicles that large. An absolute legend.
End of petrol engines. That’s what this is.
Credit to the camera person on a few of those angles for keeping up 🤣
Ludicrous
It's so fast that I had to check if the video was playing in normal speed.
ENGLISH ENGINEERING 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
I'd love see the in cockpit view.. plus what speeds ❤❤❤
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mind blown...
It's a crappy fast vacuum cleaner
The speed of this little thing is so unreal(SILLY FAST)!
In all my 22 years as a car nerd, I have never seen something navigate a course like that before.
One word: Bonkers!
The first EV car I liked 👍👍👍
hillarious
Speirling
Intergalactic !!
Looks great like a batmobile, but i kind of wished there be a Henry the Hoover reference on the car somewhere.
I was stood at Malcombe for this run yesterday!! Epic to witness in person!!
That's insane! just went like a silent rocket! When you normally watch cars on TV,  they don't seem that fast.... But this one was bloody fast, even when watching it on a video!! Sounded like an angry Dyson hoover!!
This is the devil's thing kkkkkkkkk
Like a rocket
and if you stick the fans in reverse it can jump about a mile and a half. Try to bring it back in one piece this time, Bond.
"We have the best fans here."
Oh, also it's really fugly
Oh this is a fan car?? Worked well for the Chaparral 2J, not so much for anyone following behind it though 😂
this is so ridiculously quick that it looks sped up... the video director will need to change camera positions as this thing stayed in each shot for very little time...
0,02 what's going on? He lifted up his hand thinking..... What happened?
This car should hit pikes peak next
FANtastic
On the positive note: It's super quick for sure and that sound is like a Sonic boom towards the end of the video. But why does it look like a toy?!
As an engineer, you appreciate the incredible work thats gone into this, mind blowing and bonkers,
It was clear that one day electric cars will outperform cars with IC engines. The same happened in RC racing some years ago. It just took some time to scale it up.
imagine how fast electric cars will be when the new light weight more energy-dense batteries come to market, we only just see how fast electric cars will be.
How on earth is anyone able to handle driving at that speed 😂
40 seconds driving, a couple of hours recharging. There should be a separate class for these machines, as there is for trans athletes!
It’s Batman !
Thats insane!
I love Keaton's new batmobile in that matte gray!
We need electric car version of Bac Mono like this
はぇー
Holy Smokes!
Just need to work out how to make it sound like something worth paying attention to.
The first ever 1:1 scale Scalextric
Mega mega mega run  🤯🤯
卧槽小导弹了 好家伙
Talk about "flying low?" That. Was. IT!
This thing is so cool.
Not even really into this kinda stuff but that was SICK 🔥
Formula E should fire the Gen 3 engineers/designers, hire the McMurtry team, ask them to make 20 cars and let them battle on active volcanoes or something. This car is amazing!  PD: just saw the Gen 3 run and it looks pathetic compared to this one.
It sounds and accelerates like a jet fighter.👍
NUTS!
How would it do in a 25 lap race?
The grip !!!!!!
no matter of porpoising?
How much downforce would you like? Yes.
This is what electric cars should be like. This thing makes the gen 3 fE look like a turtle
Two words - HOLY CRAP! This looked like a Loony Toon's cartoon 😂 One needs balls of steel to drive that fast!
That McMurty just f**ks off
Wow! Just wow!
Gt7 bring this track back
Ask Gordon Murray about the 1978 Brabham BT46B. It won one grand prix in Sweden and was then stopped, for spitting out dust and grit.
dangerous
BWOAH
Please release a higher quality video!!! .. This amazing achievement is let down by a highly compressed 1080p video 🙁🙏
Great event, poor organization for media. Shame.
Im very suprised that aeroplanes are allowed at Goodwood.......;)
I want one
After watching all the insane vehicles drive threw and then this thing. This one is next generation
Batman called wants his car back
One lap and battery is empty 😅
With electric exhaust and everything! 🤯
The marshall on the start line be like  "Tf was that?"
Wow. Now I want to see them do Pikes Peak.
Can I get one in black ?!!
Where my naysayers at now?
めっちゃはやい。
Reminds me a bit of the 1989 batmobile
What a fantastic creation! The best electric car I have ever seen. Entered in Le Man 24hrs by any chance?
Quick!  PS: Can we please have smaller F1 cars?
What is the smoke?
I wanna see this thing do a lap on the nordschleife 😎
I can't believe that.
Pikes Peak next?
Now realize that the panning of the camera actually reduces the send of speed
🙈🛸
That was unreal, but awesome!  Wow!
Does anyone know what the average speed was?
Are you sure that wasn't the batmobile in disguise?
im speed
😏nice!
This would put the fastest F1 car to shame.
I‘ve never seen something like this 😳 this car is incredible fast 👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍 you need a special training to handle this speed 🚀
More sustainable future lol more like a faster, higher torque future ;)
0-60mph in sub 1.4 sec , watched this record breaking run yesterday at Goodwood 🫣
This is what happens when you play  too much Forza Horizon 5 !
To think we are still at the infancy of racing electric car technology . What the future holds.
How that thing stays on the ground is amazing, most racing cars need a wing bigger than a bed to stick to the road, this thing is like a scalextrix car.
Creates its own down force even sitting still. Insanely clever and obviously extremely effective. Well done guys!
If this is the future of motorsport, I'll go watch live lawn bowls instead.
Well that sucked.
My that's fast
is a rocket ,not car.
На капоте V браво Макс
How many expletives can you fit into 40 seconds? Driver - watch this.
Bloody Bonkers!!
わお！ベリーファースト！
"The Future of Motorsport Power presented by DHL" if DHL would be as reliable and fast as this car...
What's the secret to getting that much traction, though? What are those tires made of?
One Hundred Years. That's all it took to cut a track that would've taken a few minutes, down to mere seconds.
If this the sort of car an electric future can create then I’m ready for it
Mad speed
The driver must have nuts made from carbon fibre…
A racing series based on this car will be great.
The fact this car is road legal too.... insane...
I absolutely hate EVs I find they are incredibly boring and spoilt FOS for me but seeing this live was insane. Just the pure performance was incredible to see
"you know those mad 2022 ev motors that can accelerate faster than anything that has come before?" "yarp" "and you know that mad late 70's fan car that produced more downforce than any other F1 car in history?" "yarp" "what if... and hear me out.."
I would love to see this amazing car this weekend at Silverstone to see what the lap times would be. If nothing else it would be a great way of hoovering the track.
Dayum
…like K.I.T.T. in Knight Rider but now true play speed 😅
Only one question : Is it safe drive at that high speed with audience just beside you..
This was my first year attending Goodwood and what a year to be there. First Wayne Rainey and then this. 👏👏
What is it
Majestical
I’d rather listen to a sewing machine.  Without the noise of an internal combustion engine that was boring.
what!!!!??
What a car and what a driver !
That is truly amazing. What an engineering marvel.
Reminds me of the rich kid’s go kart in the Little Rascals movie
AMG one: left the chat
A ese la policía no le atrapa ..jajaja ....😅
What  in the super car tarnation did I just witness? Please explain!🤯was that a hybrid? Also is it street legal?
That is just plane ole  BADASS
This is the kind of power you'd expect from Formula E, this would make racing much more exciting, like actual Electric F1
F1 star Max Chilton hah!
Astonishing 😲
Ferrari should pay attention here, and the other super car manufacturers too.
If that was a McMurtry fan car. How fast is McMurtry?!!?
Wow... That driver need to chill tf out bro huhu.. Impressive driving.
Impressive, but Goodwood need to up their trackside safety... if that thing had clipped the grass do they really think a couple hay bales is going to protect the families watching?
At some point during the pre race meeting someone stood up and said "Look, lets just get some bales of hay in there for protection, you know. Safety first!"
Slow it took 56sec to finish the video 😂
They could send this car out on any wet track (after the rain) to dry it up before the race...!!
Some people come here to show their cars, and some people come to do *this.*
the car looks like it's squeezed when it goes faster
This terrified ME to watch on Saturday. Gave me goosebumps on Sunday. BRILLIANT.
It was freaking awesome to see it break the record in person!! I was standing as close to the track as possible near the big screen just before Flint Wall and the entire crowd all gasped as the McMurtry shot past like an EV powered bullet ... by far the fastest vehicle on the day. Congrats to Max on a breath taking Goodwood run 👍👍
Batmobile.
WHAT!
Oh my goodness!!  Impressive driving!!
Finally an electric car that actually sounds like a tie fighter
I heard a tie fighter
WOW!
Wow
A very " British " invention ! Epic achievement ! Chris Cockerill I'm sure would have been fascinated ! Toto Wolff might be thinking " I've had this idea about how we can stop the porpoising ! "
Wow that is a rocket
There goes the new Batmobil, even the paint job is perfect for that.
ive watched it and watched it again and my brain still thinks its CGI  it doesn't look possible ! amazing
Epic
Emotionen pure ! was für ein Biest, das würde ich gerne mal in life erleben ...
1. The small width of the car allows the driver drive through the corners far quicker and with lesser steering angle in comparison with a driver of a wide car (especially one with wide front bumper winglets) who is forced to follow the curve of each corner closely and use the brakes for longer periods of time, ultimately losing speed. Having wide winglets also forces the driver to take lesser risk at the corners and be more cautious.  2. Stiff suspension, combined with the small size, small weight and huge downforce provided by the fans, all make the car appear faster than it actually is due to the quicker vertical wobble. Normal sports and racing cars don't leave that impression, because their larger size and less stiff suspension help them produce a far lesser vertical wobble.  3. The small size of the car lets the camera operators zoom-in much closer to the car, further make it look faster than it actually is.
Tbh the lack of engine sound makes it "look" even faster
It's like watching 919 Evo on Ring. Such surreal speeds, that you think if they make slightest error, it is game over.
Looks like it's on rails. Please, is there a POV from inside?
Some would say a Golf 16v Turbo would be faster!!! HAHAHA
They could've stalled the Batman movie to feature this car as the new bat mobile. Wow, wow!
One word to describe this run please
It's not the first of April, so either we have ALIEN technology or "The Flash" has built a car for "Batman".
Oh my word 🤩
I've never seen a car launch off like that before. Truly insane speed!
rocket powered? This thing IS INSANE!!!
I was lucky enough to be stood right at the 0:22 point. There was a gasp first as it took a moment for our minds to believe our eyes, then came some laughter, some cheers, but in the seconds after it had bulleted past most of us turned to the person next to us with a confused stare, as if to say, “did that really just happen?” Can only feel absolutely blessed to have witnessed that. Incredible.
That launch 👌🏾
Is nobody wondering what would happen if a front tyre pops...? It's a bloody missile straight in to a heavy packed audience protected by hay bales. I am very impressed what a machine but wow....
Oops, he started on a red light.
0-60 mph : Under 1.5 seconds Mass : Under 1000 kg
Not for nothing, but paint it a nice, "Radar negating stealth flat black" or better, the blackest, black paint and add a few decals and red or yellow pinstripe trim and you have yourself a PERFECT Batmobile that wouldn't need any special FX as it races through Gotham.  Watching this thing that those turns and curves and it does indeed look like a single cockpit Batmobile design with maybe a bit more flair on the rear wing and ground effects kit.
That start official's reaction when the car moves off says it all. That fast and that quiet. Remarkable piece of kit.
It's like a life sized Aurora XLerators car. Electric power but instead of magnets holding it to the track it uses suction.
That car breaks the laws of physics it's so fast, that is rocket levels of acceleration.
This was amazing to watch. Glad I was there with my daughter to see it in person. The film looks as though it is being fast forwarded not played at normal speed.
auf einer Rennstrecke ok . viele vergessen das das eine Todes Maschine ist.  Kaufen kann man alles aber sowas fahren kann fast keiner das wird viele Tote geben.
The fan made it a little interesting but not enough to overcome being an electric appliance.
catwoman: I'm home alone batsy rawr Batman :  🤣🤣
Not sure it has enough battery for Pike's Peak but.... I would love to see that! Maybe in a few years with the battery getting smaller per KWh...
Was that Valteri Bottas driving?
Did he stop..amazing
If we have to go Electric I want these fans at the back of the racing cars, they make it sound so much better.
Needs a couple of those mini mountain rescue jets out the back and it’s perfect x
Remember that the record was held by an F1 Mclaren, and they had seriously put effort on making that record. And this little fan car beat it. That's massive!
Bat mobil in real life
woh !! that thing is fast
Damn that acceleration is amazingly quick even the marshalls are amazed and confused 😲
That dude in white, his gesture as the car disappears at the start line.  Hahahaha, wow.
If they don’t try to smash the 120mph average speed bike record at Isle of Man, I’ll be disappointed.
Incredible. Now the competition is on full force and will try to beat it. Can’t wait for next year!
That Looks Fast
World's fastest lawnmower
Its fast of course but its got no soul.
They had it at Silverstone a couple months back. It made works GT3 cars look like a 1980’s saloon. Was probably cornering 20kph faster.
honestly incredible sense of speed even in a video couldn't imagine seeing it in person but what an amazing car and driver just crazy
Lets see if actually faster than porshe 919 hybrid evo in nurburgring
Go speed racer go!!!
Wait... Are you sure you didn't simply sped up the footage? Dude, this is insane!!! It literally looks like the footage was accelerated 1.5x the normal playback speed.
Pike’s Peak next year anyone 🏆?
Great reaction from everyone
i'll take one in black with a matching black cape and black helmet with 2 pointy ears
Still faster than Max… Oh, waaaait
What a weapon of a car, kudos to the driver, certainly knows the track👍😎🇦🇺
There is nothing to protect the crowd if it goes off track
The reaction of the guy on the start line as this thing just f**ks off is the same as the rest of us.😂
10 to 1 odds that car will be in a Batman movie soon.
People were mocking them on day 1 when they said they wanted to break IDRs record. Brilliant engineering
Prototype Batmobile
Note the day. We just witnessed the future of racing.
Sounds like my neighbours wife
I am absolutely hypnotized by this odd little speed-demon 😍
Its so small . Like a big go cart . No wonder it goes so fast
Christ! The future was yesterday it seems.
Looks like a micro machine
Start guy wasn’t happy…
i know it wasn't but it genuinely looks like the footage has been speed up
1000ch pour 1000kg 👍
Absolutely unbelievable. Can't stop watching this thing blow by the crowd like that
I feel the ev should be focused on the sky. With personel drones for us. Then we dont have to worry about traffic. Auto pilot and boom at work in minutes. No stop and go traffic and all that would mean the battery life should be longer.
Woow 😲!!! this car is a rocket 🚀 on track.
Pikes Peak next!   That could be wild
Batmobile on a LMP2 styled
Do someone think it is possible to go much faster than this? I'm gonna say I'm not sure!
Definitely placed the 'Speed' in 'Festival of Speed'
FAKE NEWS!
hammong would like to know this car location
So ridiculous
That thing looks like the coolest Matchbox car ever!!!
as ugly as it's fast. amazing.
Its a cartoon car. Its so skinny and smol, and fast. It looks unreal lol
Fast and it didn’t  look out of control
AWESOME SOUND
man trying to break sound barrier 😮
"""one of the best thing about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves something .he always respect us , the audience and his team , and he is polite in all his videos .we congratulations ourselves on this achievement . more to come 💕💕
I respect everyone who were involved in this , seriously the best piece that I ' ve ever seen on YouTube ,Hats of the Well All ! Love your videos💓
wow.
sounds like garbage! oh wait.... lol /s
"This little single-seater weighs less than a tonne, meaning that it gets a power-to-weight ratio of 1:1. The dust that can be seen behind the car is kicked up by the fans mounted in the rear that are able to provide 2000kg of downforce at a standstill. In terms of performance, it can reportedly hit 100km/h in just 1.5 seconds, and has a top speed of 240km/h."
We saw this pocket rocket in person doing the hill climb on Thursday. Not sure if was a practice run or the race itself but it was incredible! Very small, like a baby Batmobile.
I remember being blown away by the IDR. This thing is a beast!
I still wonder what the 919 Evo could do
My Civic had an AC Turbo....you know the one....get to a hill...hit the aircon button to off and the car just accelerates  a tad more up the hill....!!!!  WHAT!
I hope that they would allow F1 cars to have a single run again.
This is Batmobile. Driver: Christian Bale 😅
wow
insane
あの【室外機】の末裔だと⁉
I don’t want to be that person, but how are they able to do fast runs without modern track safety for the crowd? Hay bales and and no high catchment fences? A driver mistakes could result in some serious injuries and fatalities in the crowd.
speed of light...
Goodness me that looked so fast
Yeah unusually fast.. too fast to be really a F1 pilot drive it like a mad max... I called it AUTOMATIC DRIVER...
next stop Nuremburg
They are using fanatec podium shifters on the steering wheel.
That car looks like if Mercedes AMG made the XJ220
0:01 his reaction tho
I'm just jealous of everyone saying they saw this live and in person!
debut 39.08. awaiting for the second run...gonna be a lot faster~ even much more stable than ID.R
That just took performance to another level
Dayeemn! Prolly Faster than an F1 !!!
If Batman's car was real
What a weapon.   How many seconds is the suction system worth I wonder.
incredible
It is surreal to watch this, truly looks like it is being played in fast forward.
Camera crew were crash-zooming out cause they couldn't keep up with it! haha nuts!!!
Holy moly 😳
What I imagine the batmobile being like
That launch was like a jet being catapulted off a carrier.
I wonder how it would perform on pike’s peak? I know forward momentum shouldn’t be a problem, but what happens towards the top?
Ballistic Missile on wheels.........
Car needs a Mach indicator. 🤣
That car mad fast You see the speed when that car on the move  What a car wow
Volkswagen IDR: Wait, that's illegal
Was that Valteri?
Why did the pit crew shrug at the start?
When the 1998 season got underway four months later, it became clear that Newey had adapted to the rule changes for 1998 best. With the cars now narrower and running on grooved tyres, the all-new design of the MP4/13 made it the car to beat.
Tim Burton Batmobile!
loved hearing the fans they knew how much he was on one
Pikes Peak BABY💪🇺🇸
Absolutely _insane_ Well done, McMurtry Enginnering and Max Chilton!
That is absolutely bonkers. Can't imagine what it must have been like in the flesh. Wow!
This came up on YouTube and I wasn't expecting it. I haven't stopped watching it! I have literally replayed and replayed and replayed it over nonstop it's so amazing!!!
Whoa
If Batman wanted a car, I wouldn’t want him to buy this because he would’ve put a V8 engine with armor plated tech on it, while shooting flame comes out of it.
Batman, you need one of these !!!
reminds me of my 82 Gold Honda Civic......UNBELIEVABLE!!!!
That didn’t even look real lol
Amazing speed, but I can't help preferring Travis's run albeit 7 seconds slower!
Built like a Hot Wheels
Fun fact: The car is RWD, it launched fast (0-60 mph in 1.5 secs) because the fan was on full blast (I think?), providing 2000 kg downforce from standstill
what is that 0-60 time?!?
An f15 on wheels
Lol and this is supposed to support green energy. There is nothing green in this but awesome to see
EVs aren't the future, they're the present
Batmobile.
EVs have finally arrived. Breaking records like this is another nail in the coffin of the ICE.
YESSSS
Look like playing and Gran Turismo 😂
Front the rear fender it kinda looks like a mk5 Supra
It ain’t no Regera or LaFerrari Aperta tho!
Dam this is what electric cars are supposed to do , We need a championship with these car
Now go to pikes peak, follow the IDR path
I can run the course in 39.07.
That launch😳
That is insane
Still sounds like a Kenwood food mixer, on full tilt.... Nothing beats the sound of a petrol motor, that's all I'm saying.  When I was a lad, I'd shove a drinks can on my rear bicycle wheel - maybe EV's need this technology ?
Electric batmobile to fight climate change and have fun while doing it.. 👍
It looks dangerous that people are allowed in the same postcode as this thing. Mind blowing.
It looks like a short Batmobile
That thing looks fake or like a cartoon because it's going so fast
Reminds me of the Adam West Batmobile the way it moves
That's the end of those damn kids in their Heelys outrunning mall security. We are entering a whole new era.
almost sounds like a jet!
this thing is quik but, well the Porsche 919 hybrid evo lap on the Nordschleife is still more terrifying
That car is absolutely mental!
goofy ahh car
I don't know why people still buy internal combustion engines when this is the alternative technology
bat mobile
The batmobile
Christ almighty that thing is R A P I D
When the car is on the brakes and looks like it’s still accelerating. Yeah
Only impressed if it ran that time on hemp tyres!
looks like the bat mobile!  Dope!
I was at the FOS in 1999 to watch Nick Heidfelds record time in the F1 car & I thought that time would  never be beaten, then this comes along, street registered & just absolutely kills it.  What a car & hats off to all involved to build such an incredible piece of technology, simple stunning!!!
Ah yes... T H E  S U C C  CAR
LOL. Check out the starter in the white coveralls at the very beginning
So it just F*cks off ...
OMG LOOK LIKE A GAME VERY EXTRAORDINARY
This is insane. No matter if you hate electric cars, you have to admit this is impressive
So someone actually made the Chaparral 2J work?
GOT DAYUM HE COMIN
Wouldn't that thing go straight through the hay stacks if it went off track at that speed and potentially kill some spectators? It's impressive to see, but seems unsafe to me.
That thing should have had a comically large rocket engine attached to the top.  Amazing.
I genuinely had to double check i wasn't playing the video at 2X speed
Car was so fighter-jet fast that: Driver's head was porpoising; trail of "mist" was coming from the rear and camera had to be Panned-Out to just to keep up with the speed! Impressive piece of engineering
The fan technology is almost cheating at generating downforce
small boii
Could do my paper round in that
That steward at the start jumped and then raised his hands as if to say "what the fucks in that" 👀
Congratulations Max
When a bobsled goes UPHILL.
Knight Riders Super Pursuit Mode realized.
Must admit from an engineering standpoint this is amazing but it lacks the proper engine roar of a true racecar in my opinion not denying it's incredibly impressive however
Kinell.......
Get this car to Silverstone!!
i bet this car will be the next BATMAN Supercar.
what the ffff...      ...aaann
What the future did I just watch??? 😲
What the f…what is that? A missile?
Gosh it’s really really quick. Unreal fast. Especially after watching the top 10 fastest run then only it hits you how fast this car really is
That literally looks like a video game cheat code
Fan car!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Yahoo!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fast, yes, but it doesn't sound right. I need the noise of a V8, 10, or 12.
Mamma said dinner ready
Lookout honey, they are using technology.
Just think I never be late for Dinner
That car is just another level and a half above everything else... I wonder if it can run as fast as modern F1 car on the track
Goofy car 💀
“Now This Is Podracing”  That speed was surreal…..
''The manufacturer claims that this will be sufficient for the car to accelerate from zero to 300 km/h in 9 seconds...'' I believe that's true :)
Look like the car is stuck on fast forward😲
then they had to charge it for 12 hours overnight, hahahahaha
Looks, runs and sounds like the Batmobile. Or a fighter jet,
what was his top speed that he hit on that run
How I wish I'd been there to see this live, saw the VW IDR in 2019, that was incredibly impressive, but this missile is something else. Well done to all involved !
This would be even cooler with Danny Elfman's batman theme playing over it.
It looked like fictional batmobile speed, except it was actually real
weapon 💪💪💪
It looks as fast as that motorbike in that program called street hawk from years ago .
DHL sounds like it wants a seat at the WEF
super pursuit mode from Knight Rider. but in real life
Faster than Volkswagen IDR! That was fast!
This is an Electronic  race car Completely 🏎 🏁 Crazy Fast what is the output of the Electronic Motor and how many gears ⚙ does it have
I've been watching fast cars go up this hill all week and I can't believe how quickly this video is over haha. It takes like half as long to watch this thing is so damned fast.
The beast sounds like a jet plane passing by.
Max Chilton has 0 points in f1.
does it come in black
I'd love to see it do the Pikes Peak hill climb
0:26 being so small probably helped immensely by almost being able to bypass the chicane.
I wonder if it will make the trip to Pikes Peak.
I don't think it can be done any better. It can't be called "a lap the gods... Because it's not technically a "lap"... But close enough
Just got back from the FOS, this and the SuperVan got the biggest 'holys**t' from the crowds as they tore past.  The onboard of saturdays qualification is hilarious, the driver had eyes like saucers trying to keep up with the car.  As a bit of a comparison, it qualified 6 seconds faster than the next car behind it.
why does it looks like it's emitting something? like its has some kind of exhaust
So this is a one-venue "special"? It doesn't have to conform to any rulebook, be eligible for any sanctioned racing series, or be viable on any other circuit? Basically a very quick rolling advert, then?
That car is crazy...and the driver too. This is the best, most exciting shipping company commercial I've ever seen. Short and sweet! 🤪
As much as i know that electric cars are the future and would be faster than internal combustion engine. It just feel so sterile for me maybe I'm just old but there's something about engines exhaust sound that gives the car its personality or soul. Like hearing an old ferrari v12 or an American v8
WITCH RECORD ELECTRICK CAR  THAT IS NOT PETROL CAR SO 😐
That sound😂😂😂😂
Wow... just... WOW!!
Seriously?  Any person who is awake would recognize that every aspect of that replay was manipulated. Particularly the sound was manipulated. Pathetic.
Lightning McQueen knows well what these new kids are capable of...
Now THIS is how to make electric cars properly exciting. It was fun watching everyone at the start line having a little jump when it took off like a solid fuelled rocket. I love that it’s so tiny and fierce - at odds with the more usual low, wide and heavy handed looking electric super cars and prototypes. That fan looked like it was working hard. Wonder how fast it would be without it.
Favorite part of the video is the official at the start line almost jumping out of his shoes.
Why is he in such a hurry ?
The sounds are so insanely different to a normal EV's sounds that they almost seem dubbed over.
Hmmm seems a wee bit irresponsible to run something this fast with a couple of hay bales being the only thing protecting the audience.
its a bullet on wheels even the long straights where normally you dont notice the speed this thing is a rocket.  Wow amazing.
well as a full blown gear head, race fuel and rumbling engine loving dude, I am convinced electric will dominate that machine is just amazing.
Rubbish 🤢 sounds like my washing machine
Yo, IT’S THE LAUNCH THAT GETS ME, omg
Startline guys reaction is hilarious to see..
Astonishing!
I just love how everyone is in pure shock. Well done!
That thing is so fast it almost looks fake lol
it made it back before the dust it left behind could settle
I swear Brabham did this a long time ago...
It scared the guy in the start😂😂😂
But electric cars are boring grrrrrrr
That's not a car that's a rocket
Un record senza emozioni.. Per chi è lì.
Big credit to the driver, That was fast af
Now imagine the Ferrari F2004, but on slicks
What even crazier that someday someone will make something else to break this record again.
Omg
If your wondering how such incredible downforce was achieved and how the car seeks to he glued to the road, the car is utilizing ground effects and is bolstering it with a fan, both banned innovations from F1, (well ground effects have made a comeback for 2022 but they're still pretty regulated).
Loved that engine roar! Oh, wait…
i think he was pushing 🤣😂
Looks like a slot car going around the track!
What’s the 0-60 of this beast????
I have no idea how Chiltons brain could deal with a car this fast. The car is incredible as is the driver.
That thing is mental
It just yeets away
Nuts!
Remind me the batmancar from the 90ies
future of formula 1 speeds please FIA thank you!
Goosebumps! That was awesome
The way it just LEFT the starting line sheeesh
that was the most unreal launch i have EVER seen
I present you... THE FUTURE
Bro could ha e stopped for a cigarette and witten a letter to an old lover and still would have broken hmthe record in that rocket ship
Something tells me that car could have gone faster, barely looked like he was pushing
Amazing machine, amazing driver. Everyone involved should be very very proud. Looked incredibly stable as well. Well done.
I took a full team of ex  f1 engineers to make this car.....  now put minds to paper you get things like these
So... that's the future of motorsport then.
They need to ban electric cars immediately! Great run, but they have got to go.
A rocket on wheels
This is not even a car,  it spaceship!!
Looks like hiw Batman would drive while chasing the Joker
He got the record and he cleaned the road at the same time. Impressive.
...and then recharge the batteries for 2 hours
The reaction of the official at the starting line!!!
Gonna need a G suit soon 😆
Ofc the Batmobile takes the record
The Marshall's reaction on the right to the car at the start @0.00 says everything
Cars will be different when you grow up... that's what they said.  They weren't, but now they are (I am almost 60 years old).
Hope The ID.R Can Return the Favor
This is nuts!
Dhl is botched crook company steeling money from customers, made mistake to use them once and never again.
UFO
Reminds me of the Brabham BT46B "fan car", from the 70's. Great stuff!
Watching this car over the weekend on the tv and I tell you what the speed of this car was insane, what a way to break the record too
Looks like a cheap Hot Wheels toy.
No way it was 23 years ago I watched Nick Heidfeld set the record. I want a recount
Batman just called. Said he wanted his car back...
I blinked, and missed 3/4 of the run 🤣
So my question is, how fast is this car with the ground effect fans turned off, or how fast are all the other cars if they have 2000kg of down force added to them? This car is racing cars at FoS, that were designed where the ground effect fans are banned.   I was there this was insanely fast yes, but it is not an apple to apple comparison.   The current record has stood for 23 years until today, so are we saying that dinosaur juice fueled cars  have made zero progress in 23 years...... actually they have gone backwards?!  The highest placed petrol only car was a late 70s formula 2 with a 2.0L engine and 300bhp (BMW m12/7) and that didn't even win the championship it was competing in back in the day!!  This whole thing is by design, to help convince the easily lead how amazing electric transport is. Looks like its working too. Haha.
Here it comes, here it comes!  Oh, I missed it. I blinked.  Totally insane! I've never seen anything as fast as this, even the top fuel dragsters seem slow in comparison. This thing is like a missile with wheels!!
that is like looking at  some crafty CGI moving making... that mini batmobile is honkin...... wow...
Batmovil 😂😂
This is a very special car and I think will set the template for fast ev's going forward.
Lame. That’s not motorsport, that’s slot cars full size. Yawns
a batimovil!
like a scolded Rat 😅 Jezza
This is mind bending speed. The acceleration is nutty
0:27 car makes crying baby noises. impressive
That is one rapid car. Not been to many FOS, but this is the first time I've heard any applause and cheering for a car while going up the hill.
Respect Max Chilton...
So fast it almost looks fake😂 impressive
Holy crap, that's like top fuel drag racing minus the noise but plus corners.
Nows thats a batmobile!
Awesome job to the driver and team.  Its a UFO 🛸
I played this at 2x so the car seemed to be going 4x.
watch the starter dude in white crap his pants as it took off lol
Look like it was glued to the track, whine of the electric motors reminds me of a jet engine.
Can you please apply some speakers and V12_sound.mp3 to this car?
It was going transonic throughout most of the run 🛩
My mrs just told me that the car was almost as quick as me...  I still don't know what she meant because I drive a vauxhall astra
This is literally a electric fan-powered Road Runner that sounds like something from a Sci-fi scene.
British engineering at its finest
I saw it from the grandstand unbelievable! smashed the competition, even the 2000 hp ford EV by 6 seconds!!
Real life Scalextric .. a new level of performance and I thought the VW ev was epic 😲 hats off to the engineers ,, crazy speed is the new fashion but I’ll miss a screaming V12 🥲
I’ve watched this about ten times.
Crazy how theres people so close to the track
🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
But I thought electric racing was boring?…
Reminds me of my slot racer I had as a kid!!! Lol
I’m not English, but that’s a remarkable piece of fantastically underrated British engineering. Well done.
THIS  is what we all wanted "formula E" to be like.
Spoiler alert?
It's actually not that quick when compared to warp speed in Star Trek. About a full half second slower in fact.
Intensiv
Danm, beaten the equally absurd IDR
Nurburgring record ready to be smashed .
Amazing what you can accomplish with a political agenda. BOP anyone?
Insane in the membrane!!!
Ok.. mind blown 😳
It's so fast that it looks cartoonish
It's an RC car human sized
It’s like watching a RC car
Like a missile on wheels, even sounds like one from the outside
Ho, Lee, C%@p! 😲
Absolute mind-boggling who would thought 30 years ago we would see this broken.... it's just like an RC car with 100 lipos attached to her
This is the batmobile from the 90s, cant tell me otherwise.
Tf is batman doin in goodwood?!?
🥺🥺Any OFFICIAL REPORT abt TOP SPEED??...I'm confused!!😖😖😕
Brabham bt46b fan car inspired 🥰
Max Chilton is not a star as you proclaim.  Daddy's money bought him seats in cars. That's pathetic.
I thought the batmobile was available only in black
Insane!
0:27 One mistake and adios.
This should replace Formula E
First time a fast car actually looks fast
Make these instead of Formula E
Until the Great Reset when everyone is 'paid' via social credit score and the globalists have everyone in these buzzboxes. Then when your rulers decide youve consumed enough power/charge they'll just turn  the power off via smart tech because youve reached your limit of 'power consumption'. Enjoy suckers.
Remember there was a f1 engine merc and it had to stop to impress everyone.
Sounds a bit like a tie fighter
bro really said 😐
Wow
if he goes a little more faster he is going to break the sound barrier
Seems like a cartoon how quick it is.   Wild.
Compared to the ID.R record, this looked easy. Suggests there’s more lap time in it which is scary.
I hate electric cars but this is crazy , but still i much rather have combustion cars and some old cars that's been converted into electric cars to give them a new lease on life
Never heard of this car, or, it's team. Now, I wanna know EVERYTHING about it!!! What the WHAT!?!?!🤩🔥🔥🔥🚀
fast but boring, speed isn’t everything
Chaparral 2J its diferent
What Civic drivers blasting eurobeat think they look like. What they actually look like: Tortoising.
Why does my phone keep playing this video on 4x speed. It's annoying AF.
When you select DHL express shipping option
That's a bat mobile, comic book speed😂🤣
What's the previous record?
It's not a car. It's an electric fan. I got a few at home. Thus this record is for fans, not cars...
looks like the freaking mini batmobile
Well, the battery will wear in few minutes, but it doesn't really matter, if in that few minutes this crazy thing has already won the race. Hat off to the driver as well, it takes some balls even to believe such a thing is possible...
It's comical
The fastest vacuum cleaner on the planet ;P
If the fan brakes at 0:20 you have a lot of dead people.
I’d love to see one of those cars crash into the ‘wall’.
Electric cars....
Quite slow really 😆😆
Damn😳
The...batmobile. It's actually real! 😳
The beginning of a new era, the electric era, started with vw id, now this...imagine the future
Is that car electric with four motors?
I though the video was in 1.5x speed but it wasnt... How these cars are so fast ?
what the actual fo.0k !
soooooo sick!!!!
Absolutely outstanding!!
Wow that was impressive!
fans are cheating
Holy shiiieeetttt
This change everything
The Marshall at the start. Where did he go?
Does it come in black?
Unbelievable
I'd rather have a slower car that sounds, looks and even smells better! Did look quick though!
Just look at how shocked the person at the starting line is when the vehicle took off.  He's probably thinking .... What on earth is this thing.... No noise no smell just mind blowing acceleration and blistering speed !
Does it come in a 2 seater version, in black, possibly with a bat sign on it?
That sounds so awesome though.
This Car was stolen from Batman!Absolutli Hardcore!What a Monster!!
This is just insane. Can’t wait for the future of sports cars.
WOUAAH 🤯👍
SRT Tomahawk in real life
Seriously getting a Batman vibe! Where do I place my order?
This car can also be registered to go on the road!!
Batman at the wheel?
That guy with the chuck at the start really threw his hands up as if to say where did it go 🤣🤣 unreal stuff
So how many ICE cars beat that EV?  🤔
We are getting closer and closer to making a real life version of redbull x2010
Why is there is no specs in the video description???! Is that car powered by an electric turbine????
we need see these in motorsport
Electric IS the future
Wow! Just WOW!!
It's just big slot car!
1990 batman mobile?
I'm sorry...but I'm personally getting sick of electric "cars". This isn't a car. Neither is a Tesla. They're just big Tamiya models.
It's like those cartoon cars!
gg EZ CLAP in the chat
Okay to those saying it won't have enough tops peed. Top speed is usually governed by gearing. This has no gears. Its final drive ratio only need be set enough to achieve the desired top speed. With it's power to weight ratio, acceleration from standstill is meaningless. It accelerated to 60 mph in less than 1.4 seconds. Increasing the ratio wouldn't necessarily slow its acceleration down too much to achieve 250 mph on a long straight like the Ring has. And records are set by high cornering speeds and extremely fast acceleration at the Ring. There are a lot of high horsepower high top speed cars that don't have the Ring record.   On top of that the Speirling achieves it's downforce via fans. Drag is extremely low. Achieving high top speed is ridiculously easy when there's no drag. The only impediment is frontal area air pressure, which is why the car is so narrow. It's frontal area is more slippery than an F1 car and because downforce isn't achieved over the body that air pressure is released more efficiently than F1 or LeMans cars.  Now as for having the power to run the entire Nurburgring in one shot?  Battery: 60 kWh (800 V, 75 Ah),[1] Charging power: 600 kW, Fan power for downforce: At least 60 kW, Range: 350 km (WLTP)  Estimated range at GT3 speeds is 30 to 60 minutes.  Now since it's downforce and power delivery  is manually variable I'd assume it could do your typical 200 mile race at quite a fast pace. But lap times at the Nurburgring are 1 laps plus a couple of warmups at 15 miles each? So let's say 45 miles with 3 laps to set a record time. At 60 kWh it should easily be able to set a time using max power and max downforce.
If Formula E would feature speed and cars like this I‘d pretty damn sure watch the whole season
I can honestly say I have never seen so many jaws on the ground at Goodwood, the speed this corners at defies logic.
This shows the future of cars as when battery’s become light
Unbelievable, nothing looked so fast, it looks genuinely like a next generation car.
That thing scoots !
I think they will need better safety rails
Fastest road sweeper ever!
Stonkingly fast and a joy to see.
I love to see the concept of a fan car finally be properly utilized!! All the way back from Brabham in F1… ❤️❤️
Fighter jet on wheels
It was so fast In and person got a glimpse and it was gone
Holy crap!
What is impressive about this? I have matchbox cars bigger than this.  Where is the real life application?  The Tesla “calculator-on-wheels” generation is no doubt licking their lips.
What in the world did I just watch.. this gives me the hibie gibies it reminds me of F zero now we just need boast pads.
Fan cars need to happen! The speed and grip is absolutely insane
that was terrifyingly fast, dread to think the aftermatch if he had crashed.
Replace the current F1 GARBAGE with this freak, and i might watch it again.
Fan cars need to happen! The speed and grip is absolutely insane
I take back everything i said about electric cars
What an astonishing sound. I wish my V12 sounded like this.
I wonder how many rewinds it took him to do that
The new batmobile looks insane.
The next Aerial Atom.
Wwooooooosssssshhhhhhh
Parece le batimovil de Batman🦇!
Ariel and caterham must be sweating. Is it going to be road legal? What a weapon
At first i thought it was a remote controlled car by the way it moved😅
Where can I make a deposit for one of these?
Whats the difference between the VW record and the McLaren record?
Must have been fantastic to see it track side. It looks absolutely rapid on camera. Great driving.
Now; That's an electric car! It sounds awesome and goes like stink.
This car literally looks like a 3/4 scale batmobile. Like it's the batmobile's son or something.
Pretty funny watching it at 2x speed
What is that smoke coming from the back?
I will run, walk and crawl before I will drive an EV. F AOC, the Green New Deal and the NWO.   Mining lithium for batteries is more destructive to the environment than any fracking or oil drilling.  Wake up sheeple.  You're being lead to your own slaughter!  30% carbon tax on all goods and services.  You won't be able to afford a tricycle let alone a car.  Wake up!
Lame!
Just look at the guy at the start line, his reaction is priceless 😂😂😂
Question for Alex Summers? How fast would your DJ firestorm get up the hill it’s gotta be around the 40sec mark ?
love this kind of motorsport stories
The marshalls at the start didnt expect that launch haha
I don’t really understand the aerodynamic system but it’s amazing. Imagine a race series with these cars
1.9s 0-60....  phhhh speedy boi
Never heard a car that sounds like a jet plane as it goes past before
Really very fast vacuum cleaner. :-D
This car sucks like crazy......ehum, I mean Rocks!😁
I guess it hasn't got to worry about putting down the power. Thats half the fight when going fast. Amazing.
Looks like a batmobile ..does it come in black ? ..jokes aside this thing is fast af
🤯 That is all!
🔥🔥🔥
I’m so happy I got to see this in person. Genuinely looked like I was watching sped up in real life. Absolutely bonkers
Formula e: Takes notes 👀
It's funny that DHL are sponsoring this video. Hope DHL gets this car so I maybe can get my package in time!
Es mas rapido que un F-22
That's Batman!
I just put new batteries in my parents golf cart...let me tell you...
Stop talking about the car and start talking about what a performance from Max Chilton that was...!
Reaction of the Marshall at the start is priceless! “Scalded cat” doesn’t do it justice. Would of loved to have been there to see it IRL.
You can hear the amazement coming from the crowd at certain points. Insane what that car did!
Amazing, but I was watching thinking of how badly things could go wrong. Hay bails wouldn't do a whole lot.
Goodness!
fascinating. i think about what kind of time would have been possible with a real driver behind the wheel, like fernando alonso for example. here it was just a chilton
This is a world record in that this is the first driver to actually go fast at the festival of speed
Gma t50s порвет этот эпилятор на колесах
Nice blender!
What is the vapor or smoke coming out of the back?
goofy ahh car
I had my playback speed on .75 for listening to a speech earlier.  Even with the slower playback, the car looked really fast.  I reset it to normal speed and the car is unbelievably fast.
Its the goddamm batmobile, but smaller. 10/Out of this world cool
The guy ot the start was shocked because it took off like a rocket hahaha
I think i wet myself..
Go-kart on steroids.💪
S.P.O.I.L.E.R
it's sped up. i call it fake
Bonkers
What??  nobody wants to say how slow electric cars are this time???? 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
I want to see this car on the nurburgring!
That was wild, almost seems to defy physics.
Batman.. Is that you..?
The marshall on the right with the headset 😂
Пушка гонка 👍
I think Adrian Newey and Gordon Murray would both be standing up and giving this car and this team a round of applause. Truely amazing.
now thats quick!
is this Formula E on steroids?
This thing is just ludicrous! Chilton cheated!
Jebany!
Thats insane :O
Tis car is crazy. Would love to see it at Pikes Peak
That think is electric ⚡⚡?
It looks like the dawn of a new era in motor racing to me.
To drive that thing at full speed with hay stacks and a stone wall as barriers takes some incredible courage. Almost the same kind as the motorsport drivers from the 60s, where they also had hay stacks and stone walls as barriers
Not impressed
Am I the only one more impressed with the driver being able to actually react fast enough to control this thing, than the car itself?
Best of British. 💪🇬🇧
Even if you change playback speed to x0.75 it is still fast!
Watching this from the BMW stans was amazing!
Why the smoke behind the car ??? 🤔💯🔥🏁🏎️🤓🇫🇷
Porsche und Ferrari usw.ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha.The best is elektro.👍👍👍👍👍👍😀😀
this is not a car  this is a missile on wheels
Dat was fast
What the h*** it's F16 with wheels and nuclear power. 😂 that start is just epic... 😲
When electric cars are so fast the AIR ROARS instead of an engine!
Reminds me of the original batmobile where they speed up the footage like 5x. This car is nuts.
Life size RC car...
he can go faster.
Utter insanity*. I have never seen any car look so mind-bendingly fast.  (* - in an awesome way)
just wow. that's all i got. WOW
This + Sprint Races please and thank you.
Fan cars were banned from Formula 1 in the early 80s...just saying.
Diesel??????😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Looks like the batmobile, does the racing suit have nipples?
McMurtry: "Max you have range for 40 seconds flat out" Max: "Hold my AC/DC charger"
This car is so fast it has a rooster tail when when dry.
I’m sorry, but I hate it
Ridiculous fast…
If EVs can reach these speeds and batteries improve tenfold, then F1 can go full electric. This is the future.
Turbines were outlawed in 67 at Indy. Anything can be made quick if you want to spend the money.
If combustion engines were faster  then electric no body would rush to buy electric vehicles the brutal torque is there selling .  point. Performance is why they sell .
How could you not feel like batman with the way that thing sounds lmao
Should be the new Batmobile
What hill?
Must have been running duracell
If I may....that beats the VW IDR time of 39.09 by 1/100. Quick Nick's time was a leisurely 41.6.
That's insane. It even had room to spare at the wall.
Please can someone explain to me why electric cars are considered environment friendly when they don't have recharging batteries? and we use fuel or gas to make the electricity to charge them. I mean the think is moving why isn't it charging its own batteries or store the produced energy?
It ain't pretty
Is McMurtry going to put this in limited production? If so, how much?
the sound of that machine  💯 🔥
I wonder how many kids died from slave labor in the Congo mining the minerals for these cars.  Guess everyone is so hush on that because they can't see it from their window.
What a car and drive from Max Chilton
The back of it and the way it kicks up the dust reminds me of the original Batmobile in the classic Batman movie! It looks as quick at they even showed it in that movie too.
I tried to record this at the start line earlier and it passed me before I could even press record...
Very nice. It´s me, or the car looks like a batmobile?
The fan creating a vacuum for downforce was done back in the 60's.  .....got banned become it worked so well.
Anybody know how many pounds of coal it used to charge it?
HOLY.. that looks like 1.5 sped up😱😱
This should be the F1 rain safety car - it'd sweep away all the standing water lmao
Marshal caught off guard dozing at the start.
what the heck. 😵
Who was driving
Holy cow ! .. that thing is cartoon fast :-)
When bae says she's home alone .
Mad just mad
New Batmobile built by fans? 😁
mega
This video has everything... Games console looking sped up replay... Even a wii bowling crowd going woooow as it goes past...
Hill climb cars are the fastest road course cars, not F1 cars. F1 cars are too limited by rules designed to slow the cars down. F1 cars without those restrictions wouldn't even look the same as the do now other than the open wheels. You put this Speirling vs any era F1 car on any F1 track and the F1 car would get crushed. Assuming the battery on the Speirling has enough battery to do an entire race, an F1 car would get lapped likely twice or more by this car.
Wowzers! That was impressive! What a run!
They should’ve nickname it, “The Dustdevil.”
The reaction of the starting marshal pretty much summed it up...  "There was a car here a moment ago... I blinked, and it was gone!"  Fantastic spectacle 🤘
It's very rare that you watch a car going fast on video, that LOOKS like it's going fast. I think the "WHOA" from the crowd sums it up perfectly. That was unreal.
I saw this live today and have never seen anything move so fast, the way everyone in the crowd reacted too you just knew you were watching something really special
Like the scalextric back in the days
I hadn't even heard of that company till this week now I'm wishing I own one lol. This has been a great advertisement
GAWD DAMN BOY, SHE'S QUICK
Its like a fighter jet 😳
crazy, now just wait 8 hours for the battery to recharge and do another lap
Did Goodwood themselves forget about the iD.R? The description seems to think Heidfeld's record from 99 still stood
The guy at the start 😂
THIS should have been the new Batmobile!!!
Wow.  That’s alarmingly fast!
Yea that record is going to stand for a while.
The chorus of 'Woah!' from the stands tells all the story you need to know about what it's like in person. Coupled with the marshalls simply shrugging as it leapt off the line, it's clear this thing is in a league of its own!
I thought this was fast fforwarded lol
From now on I respect electric racing cars
Terrifying.....TERRIFYING!!!!
Not sure of what I am seeing here.. Reminds me of an old movie where the special effect was to alter frame rate to make a car appear fast.  So unbelievably fast it is comical.
I'll get me coat
Holy crap...
It does not look like it drive like that :D amazing engineering
New age Chaparral 2j!!!! What a weapon this is????
Bip bip!!!!
Well there's your next gen Formula E car right there...  Maybe they could at least take some ideas on which direction to go in the future from these guys... the fan based downforce seems genius
Amazing to watch this live. Got some amazing reactions and a huge smile from me. Quality stuff.
That’s INSANE.
Wow, looks like RC car!
It's a perfect lap
I would love to see that beast on the Nordschleife!
Just boggles the mind to see how quick this car is.
Does it have enough range for Pikes Peak? Would love to see that.
It’s so fast I thought the video was sped up
fantastic driving   best ever
Marshal was like what the f 😂
Comically quick!
0:01 the speed scared the marshall
Sorry that I am not sorry to say: the car sucks. Not just the vacuum cleaner noise, but no engine sounds equals boring. Lost interest in the record because of this.
That’s Tim Burton’s Batmobile with some bodywork modifications!
Fan cars need to come back to the mainstream
Loved being there this weekend. Absolutely amazing.
The Marshal at the start 😂 *shrugs* "well hes just f****d off"
Well, I'll never use DHL !!
Well that's a quick little mother....
Sounds like a jet
time to hop on assetto corsa
Just impressive!
Even the steward at the start was like "what was that?".
at this point why are F1 cars handicapped with rain tires if you're allowing electric cars to race unlimited?
Nothing surprising, you are basically generating tons more downforce at any speed. Old concept, been tried, been used, been banned. I don't understand why wanting to go there...nothing new. Great achievement on its own but playing by its own rules so I wouldn't go wow. Just my opinion.
well..now come the new terms..the smaller they appear,the faster they dissappear!!..
Amazing and really cool use of fan + electric, but...... how practical of doing anything else is it? It's in a league of it's own "purpose built" race cars. Kinda like the extreme pikes peak cars. 🤷‍♂️
Nice to see Batman is invited to Goodwood.
Holy Smokes! That thing is scary fast. It looks like a race-car from an alternate future where elements of the past, present, and future are all present in the car's design. Incredible.
Rippin' fast!
Batman?
Amazing and broke the VW IDR record in a short space of time. And from a pretty unknown (to me) company.
I'm genuinely curious if anything can be quicker than this, no like ANYTHING. It looks faster than an f1 car for god's sake
It would be even better with a gas engine 👌
Wow!  Well done Max and McMurtry team.
That thing is just a fighter jet on wheels! Incredible engineering. So fast and so stuck to the road it makes the footage look speeded up...reminded me of when Kitt was driving fast in Night Rider!
Wow
Almost looks/sounds like a Thunderbird
amazing how much better of a sense of speed the camera picks up with a smaller car on track!
The rooster tail!!!
what about the volkswagen IDR?
This was like excuse me I’m in a bit hurry to smash timings here.
This car is insanely fast,behind the car it looks like the G-force of a fighter jet,love to see what it will do at Pikes peak !
Dude at 0:01 just shrinking his shoulders xD
It's like you're watching something out of science fiction on FFWD ⏩️
OMG It’s amazing!
Not valid, it's not a car, it's an electric one
holy shitballs batman. It looks like the film has legit been sped up
My brain still doesn't understand how it's this fast 🤣
Godamn that's fast.
Sh1t the bed!!
Basically everyone commented they tought the playback was speed up.. i did too.. the curve transit on this thing looks insane..
Where do you put the milk.
Holy shart 😲
Fans....solution to F1 porpoise
Everyone is a gangsta until the batmobile shows up.
Looks like the batmobile 🦇
Oh my wooooord what was that!?
Like my Cocker Spaniel 🐶 when he sees a Squirrel 🐿
Tesla has convinced road users and this car has convinced track users. There is no excuse for the electric future.
"Sounds Amazing!!" - No One
I'd be scared going that far Ina video game
Assuming they’re using the two fans in a supercharger type format to increase the low pressure zone below the car
The driver impressed me even more than the car, what a level of skills to control this 🚀
Was the marshal at the start not ready for him to leave?! 😅
Future jet pilots need to start their training with this car. It's a road jet
That thing is awesome. Does anyone know how long it can keep that pace up for before it needs plugging in?
This is the best possible testimonial for EV technology... people complaining about the lack of "sound" of EV should evaluate how exciting is the noise of wind this car produces at speed. Just unbelievable!
Was that a jet? It sure sounded like one
🤯🤯🤯🤯
Tiny and fast
Brilliant car 😎
Would this be legal at Pikes Peak?
That's ridiculous,  it looks like it was speeded up but it wasn't.  It would seem electric is the future of racing.  I hope not though.
Probably the point at which people will start to take this car seriously!
That stewards reaction at the launch tho 😂😂😂
The guy at the start line seemed to have a problem...
That launch🙊
Wow
Where onboard footage?
Physics books are being re-written as we speak lol. Handles like a slot car.
As Impressive as this is I just CANNOT get over how comically squished and downsized this car looks it distracts me so much
Like he is slicing through those corners unbelievable 😳
Okay... I need this car to get to Gran Turismo or iRacing.
My heart was in my throat 😳. The driver  was literally in charge of this monster 🙉
Saw this last year at Blenheim Palace, looks like Batman's company car with the fan at the rear.
It's what Jeremy Clarkson would say...Speed and Power.
That thing is like the roadrunner from Loony Tunes! 🤯
See...now i'm wondering, would a current FIA Formula e-Prix car in full anger beat the record ?
Guy at the start was like “why did he go?”  🤣🤣
that "whoosh" every time it passes the camera sounds awesome
My neck hurt by watching this
😮
Batman will give them a call shortly 👍😊
Woah...
Where's the smoke coming from?
Yes electric cars will be capable of very high speeds, but by then there'll be a nationwide limit of 20mph, as there was in 1903 and we'll have to stop for cyclists - and allow at least 10 feet clearance when overtaking them.  The future!  You're welcome to it.  Happily, I shan't live to see it (I hope).
The Batimobile
The marshall at the start line is very surprised! Also this was the one car that even avid petrol heads were super impressed by, the comment section all weekend was slating the slower "boring" whisper quiet EV cars but when this one rocked up everyone took note. Amazing.
A 🐱 driving it he could've gone faster
unreal
OMG that is the visual and physical definition of FAST !!!
Sheesh!! Gives a whole new meaning to DUSTED!!
This is unfair! that car should be extremely illegal to use. For one, it's sits very, very low with little drag and is very narrow with a very short wheel base and to mention that it's all electric that is very, very light and this will make that car extremely fast breaking every record it can enter a chance to. THIS WAS AMAZING, I LOVED IT!!!
I heard it had been developed as a ‘pure track car’. But surely there isn’t a category it could legally race in. Even if there was it would quickly be banned. Great theatre though!
Hi TikTok
My jaw hit the floor when the car lanched and stayed there for the whole time !! That was so so fast!
The way it moves off the line .. it's simply scary.
FZR 2000 vibes
Give it a few years and we'll all be driving something like this to Tesco to do a weekly shop
That thing is incredible. I liked the Marshals face on the start line, it either went too early or he blinked and missed it start.
This is actually the Deliverator’s car from Snow Crash. 🤣
To the bat cave !  🦇
That mcstirfry thing was insane, unforgettable
This thing is so tiny it looks like a go-cart with some body panels on it in person. It's seriously half the size of an F1 car.  Actually come to think of it, it's not that light considering the size, it's still about 1 ton.
That looked ridiculously fast
best Goodwood run I've ever seen
I was there, nice to be part of history! It didn't look real, but it was 😂
Pikes peak record next??
Autonomía de 5 km
Fascinating ridiculousness awesomeness
No matter how fast they make them, still boring without the sounds and theatrics of internal combustion.
McMurty: We need to double the height of the hay bales Hay bales: Am I a joke to you?
Goodwood is overrated
This is absolutely bonkers. Takes off like a Top Fuel Dragster, corners like an F1 car and looks like a squished batmobile. I love it!
Holy 💩. I knew it could do it! And the VW iDR was an incredible car itself!!!🎉🎉🎉
That was incredible! Looked like it was on fast forward playback speed!
This is almost comically fast.
Very fast milk float was his grandad called Ernie
Holy canole! That was comedy fast! You'd need fighter pilot reactions to drive that fast!
That thing is a missile 😳😳
It's almost cheating... The science and physics this car implores are amazing.
At first I thought this a speedede up video and then realized the contrary. That is incredibly fast, compact and sounds awesome but I got to laugh as the first advert I saw was for DHL hahaha
Glad this happened. Saw the comments against formula e when it broke down and became frustrated. As if nothing else breaks down. High performance vehicles ICE or electric are going to break down. It’s the nature of bleeding edge technology.
Outstanding, that is the result that you get with electric motors ground effect aerodynamics with fans along with active suspension.
Looks like a shorter version of the Batman Returns bat mobile
0:01 The reaction of the start marshall on the sudden, near-silent acceleration is priceless!
There'll always be an asterisk when you strike f1 times on the grounds of "safety" but let every other car go all out.
Phenomenal
Omg wow
Ok how much downforce that car creating going around those corners like that!!?!?😭 It looks so light and heavy and doesn't even seem to have that big of a wing/side skirts!
It looks like a dame Batmobile!!!
Holy smoke!
If only this was how Formula E drove
Thank you!
Woww
So basically this is a modern electric version of the Chapparal 2J
now that's quick
The speed and performance of that thing is absolutely mind blowing.
But can DHL deliver packages in this speed?
Hopefully F1 cars begin to follow suit. Small cars are much more entertaining to watch.
Thought I was watching in 2X speed
It reminds me of watching the original Batman tv show and seeing the batmobile racing to get somewhere and the video being sped up
for real, the way he took of was insane and the speed also pure insanity!😱😱
This is MAD :D
We are now seeing the true performance of electric motors. This is most certainly a direct drive axial flux electric motor. You will never get this kind of performance from a gas engine. For two reasons: (1) low inertia drivetrain (2) maximum torque across drivetrain.
What's the range on this? Can it do Pike's Peak or The Ring?
lol  The reaction of the track officials at the starting line when the car took off.
Wow wow wow.  Utter rocket ship
Amazing!!!!
Formula E take notes
Every time I see Goodwood videos I can help but feel like its nice that they keep it close to the spectators, but if something really were to happen like the car would crash and roll there would be contless deaths. It seems like the safety precautions are really low.
Tiny fast thing
Formula e should take notes
Welcome to the future
What in the.
That start ...
Watch the F1 fan bois pull every excuse known to man now 🤣
Next up breaking the record at the Nordschleife?
Lol looks like the recording has been sped up, amazing
WaWasThat??
wait till you see it on WEC or so it will blow away the other teams (pun intended)        well it will never be in any competition i guess wich has rules to outlaw the fan-car but crazy nonedeless
Electric cars are aids.
Is this faster than f1 car???
i hate electric car but i have to admit that was mental .
Okay... where I can watch this in real time, not speeded up
Like a preverbial substance off a certain gardening implement 😉😉
fast but boring
Sounds like an rc toy car..wonder what build quality and reliability is like..battery longevity and stamina..oh and is it charged by wind or solar generated electricity?
The marshal’s reaction at the start sums this run up 😂
This Is Tomorrow Calling
Turn on the HUD bro!
I thought it was sped up footage
If you look closely.. You can see the car is so fast.. Behind it the sound is trying to keep up
Id like to see what the w11 could do on this track
Record of nobody cares race
Can that be the batmobile from now on? 😎
OMG
I saw that car yesterday, boy it was fast
WOW!! That was fast!!
The white batmobile
We seeing it on the tv or mobile device cant even thunk about what it looked in real life. Love it.
The marshal shrugging after it starts 😂
Im confused... What ist about the smoke??? It ist electric... But where comes the smoke from???
I think it looks like the bat mobile.
The launch startled the marshal!🤣. Wow, love seeing amazing things coming from sheds…ok that’s not fair…. Giant killer extraordinaire.
So this is what Max Chilton is doing this year.
This is a damn rocket F1 is nothing compared to this 😮
That car is too fast
one quick hoover!
The fastest vacuum cleaner of the world! 🤣👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I'm curious if a modern F1 car can beat this...
I'd have been dead in the first corner. 😂
I'm so conflicted about this car... I love it and I hate it 🤣
Literally a vacuum cleaner.
Wow wow wow
Holy sh1t
Stats say 2000kg of downforce (4400lb)!!
😍😵
Paint it black and it's the Batmobile. Makes the right noises too...
Just look at the guys reaction of that launch in the beginning, says everything
That 0-60 mph was lightning FAST!!!😮😮
The key here is the fan and the fact that it’s downright tiny
scalextric :P
That start official's reaction when the car moves off says it all. That fast and that quiet. Remarkable piece of kit.
0:01 Look how marshals kinda surprised by the acceleration of the car
at first i thought it looked weird and quirky, but one absolutely mind blowing record breaking physics bending run later, I must say   I am a big fan of this car  Ba Dum Ts
It’s like those small 2000’s F1 cars. Hint hint @F1
Looks like a remote control car it’s that fast
Unbelievable wow. Amazing job my  congratulations to the team
Im not a kill joy but one little mistake and it won't be so impressive, the saftey of abit of hay is pathetic
That's a madman behind the wheel!!
It doesn't even look real. Looks like a cartoony parody due to its size.
HO…LY   SHI…!!!!
That thing is awesome and amazing.  But, it won't come close to the 919 EVO.
Ok Kitt, let's hit the Turbo Boost.
I want to see racing series with this kind of cars.
Wow!!
in 20 years or so when we get over ourselves about electric cars, we'll look back on things like this with excitement knowing what great machines were to come. we just need to accept that electric power is coming and either way the ICE will still always be around, just less prominent
Probably can't even race it as fan cars are mostly outlawed in any series. As an engineering exercise it's incredible though.
GODDAMN!
That was like the Bat-mobile in the old Batman films when they used to speed up the footage to make it look really fast. 🤣
HFS
how its possible ... 10k likes and 6,559 viewers , maybe they are friends of the driver lol
That’s so quick it actually looks like the video is on fast forward. Amazing.
What a feisty beast! Congrats to all at Mcmurtry team 💪👌
Now for the Nurburging! Also, wonder what those marshalls were upset about at the start of the run or if they were just impressed with how it instantly disappeared
Is Bottas driving?
I'm shocked. Bravo! The focus of the driver must be superhuman!
it's looks like jackson storm
The gentlemen at the starting line were not ready for that launch!!!!!😂😂😂😂
I cant get over the marshalls reaction at the start
To see any record broken is an achievement. However, put this into perspective: this car has beaten an F1 car (with grooved tyres and only 1,8 m width!) from 2 and a half decades ago at a track which is tremendously unsuited to an F1 car, and tremendously suited to a bespoke BEV which does not have to follow any regulations.
It looked like a Scalextric car flying on a track
is the driver is a pilot ! ... he was flllyyyyiiinnngg !!
Now that is a batmobile
That is fast is flying.
Very impressive, but am i the only one hoping for everyone in the croud it doesnr crash at these speeds?? I mean its a festival of speed.. but this is just trying to break a record which could use some more protection for those watching?? 😅😅
Are F1 cars still banned from setting competitive times?
I don’t know how many times I have watched this
It looks like the bat mobile 😭😭😭
Why is there smoke behind the car
Nuta!!
I wonder? Is this the solution to drying the wet roads that delay Isle of man TT and MGP races? Say 4 or 5 starting at different points on the mountain course each doing a lap, the hot tyres and the vacuum should dry the road in under 30 minutes.( assuming a range of at least 37 miles with the performance it shows) It use to work with the wide tyres of the sidecars.
Buzz Lightyear HAD to be the driver. That thing... Geez!
looks almost cartoonishly fast
I am really interested what it can do an a race circuit like brands hatch
This is insane
A bullet
I called it. The McMurty is an entirely different animal the the ID.R! Without the commentary, could hear the amazement from the crowd!
looks like a slot car race
What's the internal combustion record?
the fastest ugliest thing ive ever seen in my life, i love it
HOLY SH$T!
racing would not really work imagine trying to slipstream to overtake haha it would be like hitting the brakes
Lol, the marshal at the start is like….”what the heck!” 😆 This is an insane beast!
I heard that James Dyson is suing for breach of patent.....:)
Alright send it to Pikes Peak now.
The Mercedes W11 would break that record for sure :)
Not an e fan but that’s awesome 😎
Is that smoke, dirt, debris off the floor or what coming out the back!?  Lol
Ok, so when do we get ours. Homie in warp speed. Its a new secret forza car in real life🤣
Cool
Today is special day for EV world
its batman !!!!!!
Never seen anything like this, looks more like a fighter jet than a car, what a piece of engineering
This was about 20 times more satisfying to watch than the formula e car drive through the same track
reminds me of ace and gary, but not ambiguously
Wow!!! I'm not buying a tesla.. I'm buying this😛
Like it's on rails
No Brasil, a gente diria: Eita porraaaaa!!!!!
An absolute missle! 😍
LETS GO!!!
Captain Picard called. He wants his warp drive back.
MrMcPocketRocketVacuumCleaner
Wow
What a man, what a machine!
That is the batmobile , surely ....
It's there and then it's not!! That thing is insane
That thing is literally a UFO 🛸
Oh my word, I thought my speed setting for playback was on 2X!
It's moving so fast it looks like an old batmobile getting rocketed to super speeds with special effects.
Is that Batmobile?
Video is overly sped up
Awesome.
That car was a plane on wheels 1.3 zero to 60 is crazy 🤪
Holy crap that was fast, that took off like a missile
Finally, another EV that i can like
What is the range? 50 seconds? 🙈😂
the likes button on this video is as fast as this car. 9982 likes while there are only 6030 views xD
It almost looked like the video had been sped up.
When it started I really thought, its an RC Car.
right, I know this thing is fast, ok, but I get much more joy out of watching some old, airplane engined car from 100 years ago than any of this elecrtic stuff.... and I'm an eletronic engineer🤣
That how formulae should have been in the first place
holy crap thats impressive!
I hate electric cars but this was an unbelievable demonstration of outrageous speed. Driver concentration must have been paramount but at least he/she didn't have the distraction of changing gears. Who was the driver, I didn't catch that?
Cartoonishly quick.
You can tell by the gasp of the crowd and the wail of that Banshee engine that the company will have made world headlines with that devastating display.
So fast, yet so stable now that's power
Like a stabbed rat
It genuinely looks like its been squished
whats the stuff comming out the back of the car?
Jeezuzzzzz
This makes me think about the future, and the awesome things we won't be able to see... That's how powerful it is. Not just a car...
So it's a Scalextric car right....?
Looks like scalextric
The marshals response on the launch ....dont think he was ready for a fly by at the starting line
His car just shamed all manufacturers!!
Looked like a bloody drag car the way it took off! Brilliant British engineering 👏
Makes f1 look like a turtle 🐢
How insane EV trends are growing. I'm a enormous petrol kind of person who also appreciates EVs. From the streamline design to instantly mad toque, I was WOW'd. I don't care if either of you people are anti-EV, come see this Batmobile.
Every straight it looks it is about to liftoff. Impressive speed
JFC that's fast.
Very impressive.  Next step : Pikes peak ? It would be great to make an attempt.
Holly! It was fast!
See that? If electric cars were all about being this imaginative and had this level of presence, there wouldn't be a single complaint about them. This is what throwing away the rulebooks looks like. _This_ is what a revolutionary car is.
Looks like a fighter jet .. and goes like one .. all it needs is a 🔥 coming out the back !!! 😉 .. ✌️
How long before this will appear in Assetto Corsa? 😂 incredible piece of engineering. Absolutely bonkers. Let it lap Silverstone or Spa, I need to know the times. 😆
Now where can I order this car.
Wow even on video it looks impossibly fast!
Believe they limited top speed to 150mph. Imagine with no limiter !!!!
That’s a very quick way to get your milk delivered
Looks like a clown car tbh xD
Viral in 3... 2... 1...
Unfortunately, i doubt any ice cars will ever have the record again
No drama just sheer speed and grip, great driving and fantastic machine.... Sounds like a Dyson on full tilt! What a unique awesome sound
did the driver lift near the brick wall ?  I assume the seat is also a potty.
Remember in Batman films when they'd speed the film up to make the car looks fast. Well this.
As if that things gonna get number plates 🤣
😲: Too late. Already dropped the beer.
I thought the whole point of the fan was so that they didn’t need the wing?
is this car faster than an f1 car?
🤯🤯🤯🤯
Problem is it can only do it once and than it needs a day to recharge.. what a POS
i know i should not swear but I spent the 39 and some seconds doing that. Hats off: that's thing is a demon!!!
Engineers: How much grip should we give the car?  Executives: Yes.
The Future!!
That record won't be broken for a long time
Wow
I am speechless. Why cant F1 be like this?
we have the new Batmobile - no mods needed
Obviously an awesome car but max drove the wheels off that considering some of the constraints at goodwood. Team/car/driver have to be chuffed with that!
That was SEXAY!!!
Think I just watched that in fast forward 🤷🏻‍♂️
I found the EV's so boring, but this was absolutely brilliant, very theatrical.  When I first watched it I swore the footage had been sped up, or it was an RC car, it's got that crazy look about it like physics are on hold for a few minutes.  I wish there were a few seconds more at the start of this when you can hear the fan spooling up
Damn
Nice they can stick it to volkswagens idr  love an underdog beating the big dog
It's more like something that's been shot from a canon, dog jebus.
Time to see that at Nurburgring.
Thats just WOW fast. Technology has spoken
Yeah, that's surreal. Nice job.
Now that is exciting! That thing freaking rips!
ev garbage.
It’s a new era
this thing looks like it's going in fast forward mode...damn
That’s crazy. Cool to see the record broken!
Wow
Amazing 🤩
That's too fast man
Respect to the driver Hats off to you sir
Is that valtteri bottas driving?? 0:03
McMurtry turned up with this thing and just did biggest flex on every other manufacturer at Goodwood. Its absolutely bonkers!
Belo Recorde👍
Can we give a bit of appreciation to the driver too, it's surely not easy to control such a beast.
For a "silent" car it sounds like a rocket!!
If a Cylon was a race car this would be it
Heck that thing is fast!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The 2 Marshalls jump at the beginning, the one just shrugs in disbelief
People on the internet loosely use the word "insane" but this is really the appropriate time to say that was absolutely INSANE! 🤯
Needs to be the next Batmobile
Battery from 100% to 20% xD
What's really impressive is that it has 8500 likes out of 5262 views. That's pretty impressive.
Wow!
Imagine having F1 cars the size of racecars and not oversized trucks...
Unnngh.
Looks and sounds like the Batmobile from Batman the Animated Series. Speed looks pretty comparable as well.
The start line marshal's reaction to it launching says it all, incredible speed.
Cannot deny it,thats impressive!
Very impressive time but it still doesn’t count in my eyes. No sound or drama with it. 😞
Batman: I'll take 12!!
Deam that's quick boooyyy!
Now put Richard Hammond in that.
That thing was hauling all the asses goddamn
This is the type of car I would love to see racing in Monaco. They are small, nimble and very fun to watch.
This thing has a NUMBER PLATE? Next stop, the full length of the M40.
I want one of those vacuum cleaners!
Did someone say pikes peak or Nurburgring?
what kind of andrian newey-esque thing is this
This is the batmobile!   Change my mind...
I'm a bit confused, yesterday I saw this car on YouTube setting a time of 41.3 or something and saying the record was 39 or 38 something...now today it broke the record, congrats. So curious what was the previous record?
I'd call that " proof of concept " right there....rocket ship!
Amazing performance! What’s the chance of a petrol powered car matching or beating the time?
oh wow, what did I just witness? well done bravo bravo..~Trooper
Honestly a racing series of these would do bits
facile de battre un record avec une petite batterie lol, prochaine fois une thermique avec un réservoir de 10 litres va faire mordre la poussière à cette poubelle
whats stopping this from just obliterating spectators? i thought they werent really supposed to go  all out at goodwood as it seems like spectators are so close and all there is between the car and them is some hay
Cameramen are like, "next camera, next camera, next camera"
The next Batman Movie better have this.
Hilarious reaction by the starting line stewards. This is pure madness.  Once the battery technology advances a bit so these electric cars become more feasible, I fear the public roads around the world are going to get absolutely crazy with so many people with so much instant power.
I am still in amazement... We NEED a racing series with these motors, they look absolutely RAPID! Imagine 20, 25, 30 of them rallying around tracks all throughout Europe, the downforce this creates is absolutely incredible for how it looks, it looks super unconventional to be a record breaker, destroying the previous record set by an F1 car! Seriously amazing work. Really cannot wait to see more from these guys.
Can we have a onboard 😍
Pfft, my Geo Metro can comfortably seat 4 people and still weigh less.
I want one
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Is seems to me that with that speeds, a few bales of hay aren't going to stop that car if it loses control?
I like many others here was wondering if the footage was sped up.. apparently not 😳  This is the first electric car that I actually like lol
the marshal at the start was left discombobulated
Looks like batmobile
0:16 Dang that's a great shot
You could literally HEAR THE AERO.
Too fast to be standing trackside....
It looked like it was 2X. Bring back fan cars. The F1 cars look like 3D aero models. It reminds me of the monohulls trying to compete with the Cats. Spending a gazillion dollars optimizing a fundamentally weak design.
my concern is, the more they going faster the more dangerous for the spectator. Imagine going that fast and turn that thing towards them
Another vacuum cleaner on wheels
It even looked lightning fast on video…. 😬
Best vacuum cleaner on the planet. Must be dirty changing the bag.
A sad day. Never forget. Batteries don't produce electricity.
90s Batman Animated Series Theme Song playing in my head as that elctro batmobile breaks record !!!
The guys in white in the beginning are literaly like "where did it go??"
Now this is podracing!
But it’s NOT an actual car !!! It’s just a very fast appliance. Where are the “men” these days? Thrilled with geeky EV’s…👎
Hey it looks like a tiny batmobile
Can we get an F2004 on modern slicks to run this? That would be nutty fast.
what i just watch? the damn thing didn't even budge in the corners
Formula E isn't interesting, we need these
i love the reaction of the marshal at the start. gratz McMurtry team.
Whoa.
Now, that is the future!
i saw this car on the track on sat and have to say its amazing how fast it really goes
electric power sure is crazy, whether you like it or not. these electric rockets are so impressive to watch
We need dash/cockpit cam footage :O
Love the hand gesture from the start line marshall - "where'd it go?"
This is the craziest thing I've seen in a LONG TIME. I'm glad I got to see this.
Play this on 0.75 speed without the volume and the only giveaway is the fps drop. Honestly this car is beyond incredible. Amazing job to the guys who built that thing, you have built a monster 👏
Wow! The spectators trust those hay bales way more than I do 🤣🤣🤣
00:02 - Referee was like "Where has it gone?!"
Alex Summers could have gone quicker
Is this real??? Looks fast forwarded!!
It's like the vids on fast forward 😅
I want to see a gas powered version of this with the same amount of horsepower
That speed on that track... Is a bit dangerous for fans. But very very cool none the less
Did not expect Batman participate at Goodwood 😄
I have to ask... Would scaling this exact tech up, enlarging this whole thing up 30-40% (or whatever) to a standard size make it faster or slower?
Freak'n Batmobile 🍾
Not impressed. Racing drones are much faster going zero to 200 Km/h in 1 second.
This, IDR and 919 Evo defies physics
Didn't know that they allowed DC01 Dyson vacuum cleaners to go up the hill 😂😂😂
Suono magnifico.
That is fast
That's one heck of Choro-Q
Make some race with this tiny rocket !!!!
Ridiculous super fast
They cheated… some kind of secret invisible, 6th dimensional rail system!!
What's so special about it? An F1 car would go even faster on this track, let Hamilton drive a W10 there and set the ultimate record
Real life rc car arrma Vendettaon track
Mode supersonique activé
They should really try out this car at the old Nürburgring Nordschleife.
Let Max Verstappen loose up the hill in his F1 car. Sub 30 seconds is my guess.
Looks like a rocket has been launched... impressive acceleration!
We need this bad boy at Pikes Peak!!!
That's crazy fast, it almost looks like the footage is sped up, lol. That thing corners like nothing else.
just looks like a rocket accidently driving the course.
this car was made when batman wanted to go karting and his batmobile didn't fit on the karting track
Perfect for the track but never for the road ... way too fast.
I gotta watch that again just to take it all in
incredible and impressive
Faster then a Formula E car wth
Wow! That’s comically fast. Bravo.
Thats how quick a formula e should be
*WOW!* 😯
Just like car, this video is fast - so fast in fact the likes (currently 6.900) outnumber the views (4.931)
That thing goes like an absolute rocket!
Absolute insanity!! This thing is just unbelievable. Really goes to show how important aero is on a car.
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW, I'm speechless how fast this thing is....
Amazing. To think this thing will be road legal (fan off) is crazy too. Pikes Peak next?
I think it can even be driven faster and improve that lap time by a few seconds
There's a new Goodwood Hill RECORD !!!
Its a mini Batmobile 🦇
What a stunning run!!!
At least Richard Hammond was not given a go in it
This is faster than KITT with a turbo boost.
IT LOOKS AND SOUNDS LIKE A BATMOBILE
Nice batmobile 👍
Awesome!! Congratulations to all at McMurtry - I had a feeling after watching the previous runs (courtesy of Youtube) that the Speirling had a record time in it! This is a staggering bit of kit and the company deserves its success! I'd absolutely love to see this thing in person... Well done to your drivers too - superb skill and put in some immense runs over the weekend.
It was amazing to be in the crowd for this car’s run. Great reaction from everyone.
The cheering at 0:22 really sells it all. Its extremely rare for any car at Goodwood to get that kind of reaction.
Batman wants his car back.
BLOOOOODY HELLFIRE that thing goes like a coked up rat.
Electric car
Yeah yeah, but how fast its on the Nür?
Awesome, it's like an evolved 2J!
Mental. Absolutely insane.
Max Chilton is The Batman. And his Bat belt incorporates a supporting harness for those very sizable balls he has. Bravo Max, Bravo!
Would it be quiker than a formula 1 car on this track?? I sure looks like
this is actually incredible!
I had to watch again out of the shock and disbelief of what I just witnessed.
Well driven Max…. No not THAT Max !😉
This would make for a quick commute.  Is anyone really all that surprised the miniature batmobile would be this fast?
⚡🚀👽
🙌✨🌎🌍🌏✨🙌
What's thaaat?
Runs on nuclear coal sunshine wind
Just don't hit anything with it, dead in a battery fire.
What is the smoke behind the car?  Battery cooling?
Is that... ar those fanatec advance paddles???
The guys jumping when it took off pretty much sum this car up
Its time to destroy nordshcleife record too
absolutely insane
That car is fast but, damn is it boring.
Congrats FIA, road cars are officially faster than F1 cars
reminds me of jackie chan in canonball run
Wow, just wow! Respect to guys who designed and built it.
Well that doesn't seem real. Guess I need to do some research. That's wild
I saw the live broadcast and it seemed to me that they had speeded up the video. Revised now it is unbelievable.
That marshall at the start looked displeased about something when it took off
I was there yesterday when he almost did it. The speed of it past the house and up the hill was mind blowing!
F1 cars should also go full throttle up the hill
It's like a car from the Cars movies.
Amazing to hear the “Oohs!” From the crowd
freakin' Batmobile
I love its styling so much, looks like one of those fictional cars that Hot Wheels would make
is is that a SUPRA??!!
A electric racing car maybe more fun to drive than to watch..
It took me over 40 seconds just to watch it... 😂
it actually looks like it's been speeded up.
Was no fan of EVs but must say impressed by this car
It looks like a mini Tim Burton Batmobile.
The organisers bottoms will be clenching with the speed of that and how useless bails of hay are and how many people it could decapitate 👍
What a terrible video! Where's the time counter? What happened to this channel?
It was so underwhelming compared to the group C cars and F1 cars, I went to FOS with an open mind and im afraid to say electric cars are not exciting
The guy at the start line is genuinely surprised by the way it accelerates!! 😂
Looked just like Adam West's Batmobile when they sped up the film.
IST literal a batmobile
HOLY CRAP THAT LAUNCH, AND THAT SPEED!?!?! truly mindblowing🤯🤯🤯
People who operate vehicles this fast are not called drivers, they are pilots.
So this car is the real Red Bull X1!! Amazing that in only 30+ secs this car reached the finish line.
Never heard it change gears once....
now put lewis hamilton in that car, could you imagine if the broke the record again?
Still say, fan above each wheel, outside the vehicle, taking their input from the front, and sides of the vehicle, and pushing the vehicle down from above (think upside-down ducted quadcopter) on a 4x4 drivetrain. It makes more sense, to me.   Every course would have to be vacuumed before every race, just to maintain visibility, in a race between two or more of the Speirling. The Speirling also needs to have perfectly level ground, to stay well planted in turns.
WOWOWOWOWWOW!!!!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Insane
Love cars but this event with no fence between cars and audience is crazy.  One flipped car and this event is cancelled and a lot of people dead or hurt.
that car must have a fast forward button
Max was moving so fast the crowd didn't have time to cheer, just gasp!
That's the sound of 2 TONS of downforce being produced by suction turbines underneath the car. This is some outlandish tech on display here. The commenters literally couldn't keep up with how fast this was going.
Finally, an electric car that actually SOUNDS fast
When I saw the title, I couldn't believe it. And then it launched from the starting line
Eléctrico tenía que ser.
That car was on rails.
Awesome
Ground effect aerodynamics, nothing new here, just well implemented. GREAT marketing tho, thumbs up for the exposure.
Damn, had to stop once "sound" came through
Amazing car... just hope someone has checked if hay bales are sufficient to stop the inertia of that vehicle if it leaves the track at top speed?
It looks like fast forward video  Omg The electric future is lit 🥵🥵🥵
Should have called it the flying Dyson.
i dont mind not hearing the engine if i get to hear sound pressure like this, damn.
Even if its electric, you cant deny this thing is insane.
so fast but so danger... i think that barrier not enough to absorb anything what happen
"Yeah, I drove F1 but wanted something really fast." Completely mind-bending video.
"How much downforce do you want?" This thing: Yes
Sounds like Kitt From Knight Rider when he hits TURBO Mode yea ya ya ha ha Love Godlike yea ya ya :D take today petrol
You can hear the crowd responding to the pure speed. Say again that EVs can't be exciting?
Formula-E *sigh*
Oh boy, Max has just sent it.
omg!!!!!
Damn.
Lil Batmobile got Speed ngl
I have never seen a car launch so fast before (apart from drag racing)
Who said electric can’t be exciting, what a machine!
woah! the aero rooster tail
Cool sounds. Really fast. Didn`t realize it was a fan car. Thought it was built buy fans.
British car  Designed in Britain  Built in Britain  British driver  🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
I understand its fans are sucking that thing down to the road -- nevertheless, the chassis' narrowness makes this kind of handling impossible for my eyes and brain to reconcile! This is one of my favorite car videos ever, ranking right up there with one of the recent all-time great videos in the Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo record lap of the Nordschleife. Congratulations to McMurtry and to Max Chilton. I can't stop watching this.
Needs a v12
⚡️⚡️⚡️
Wow
Surely them hay bails wouldn’t do a thing if the worst was to happen
had to check my playback speed
Watch the Marshals reaction at the start, he clearly didn't expect him flying off, it could have been dangerous if he'd stepped forward a few inches 😳
you cut the 10 seconds before the start when the fan spooled up. best bit.
Sound like jet fighter, but looks faster!
closed my eyes and thought i was hearing top gun!
The bloke at the beginning like 🤷🏻‍♂️
People, keep in mind that this thing has MORE battery capacity than a Formula E car, and 2-3x the power. 100x the downforce, LOL. I'd LOVE so see how this thing hold up for longer stints. Cooling is less of a thing with electric, but car makers tend to underdo that part on EVs because the weight gets out of hand before they get to cooling. Surely over 45 mins + 1 lap, this thing will lap a Formula E car multiple times, even if it has to turn it down a notch.
Ok that looked as crazy as original Gran Turismo Red Bull X car, except this is real life.  Incredible run...Never will be beaten for a looooong time.
For all those that say, "yeah but put an XYZ motor in an ABC and it would wipe the floor with this" there is nothing to stop anyone doing this. But no-one has, yet.  So this thing is demonstrably faster than any car on the planet up this particular track. And for those who say, "yeah but an XYZ would whoop this thing around the 'ring" try telling a top fuel dragster driver that their car isn't impressive because it would be slow around a go-kart track.
Never thought that the batmobile would break records in real life!
Wow he have speed hack...:)
Power
Watched it earlier, and jaw dropping. My wife said why were you shouting and swearing. I said because it was fast as f%#$ 😂
I can't wait to see these racing on a track!
Hehe think car
Fantastic. You could only have improves it by making it black and him wearing a Batman outfit.
In onboards sounds like a Formula E car
I don't see a reason why this technology should be banned in sports. Race cars these days are too dumbed down in my opinion
HOLY CRAP!!!!!
to think this thrashed the MP4/12 F1 car by 2 seconds is nuts!
Not a porpoise in sight...
The take off was unreal
That got off the line pretty f in quick,, most impressive..
This is shockingly fast! Impressive!!
Now That’s a earth land spacecraft.
Excellent! I wonder how fast it can keep going over 6 minutes at the Nordschleife.  On this track, being narrow might actually be an advantage.  This thing may well take less time between and through some corners on the Nordschleife than the ID.R. It probably can't touch the 919 Evo in most sections.
We need a racing series of these kinda cars!!!
that doesn't even look real
Can't believe I hadn't heard of this car. I'm renaming it the Pocket Rocket™.
Well done, the start looked slower than yesterday's run.  Either way an epic machine.
One slip and hundreds of people could have died 🤦🏻
Is that a Dyson or a Hoover?
This would be a great car to use for a "Back to the future" redaux!;-)
Amazing, but what I love most about this car is that it’s electric yet completely obnoxious. The sound from the fan and how it shoots air straight out of the back. If this car doesn’t get you excited about the future of cars and electrification I don’t think anything will.
I was at fos yesterday and can honestly say, i have never seen anything so quick.. it was frightening.
Goodwood YouTube admin argued blind with me in 2019 that Roman Dumas beat the record in qualifying with the ID.R lol  *Edit* they aruged that the Heidfeld record was broken which wasn't the same as the outright record, which was broken
When you see something like that and hear something like that. You know that it is the future... Blistering
THAT DIFFUSER !
😂 The only thing mire crazy than this car is Max for driving that insane thing!
Show us the onboard only
i love me some piston banging.......but this is crazy i thought the volkswagon ID was fast.......i stand corrected!!!!
This thing was fricking mental!
would this car appear in FH5?
I believe we have found the next Batmobile.
Side mirrors! ? Why nobody can even catch up to you in that thing.
Deja vu
The McMurtry Spierling is such a bad name. Should have called it the Fanatron3000 or something memorable lmao.
Damn, that car was blazing down the track at blistering speed while looking like its on rails, sheesh.
People can hate on EV's but there just something about pure silence and that speed that's freaky the the whoosh as it goes by it's eerie.
Sheesh car had jet engine flying that fast.
Crazy. It was too fast for the camera. By the time it was in shot, it was gone!
That second corner is what gets me... it just does not look real. Hats off to Max Chilton for driving the nuts off that thing!
I'm sorry but, if I'm Max Chilton here, as I stop the car, get out and no doubt be set upon for an interview, as soon as a microphone comes near me, they're getting................... I'M BATMAN .....  Interviewer: You've left the competition a long way behind there!! Me: Yes, WHERE ARE THEY!!?? WHERE...ARE..THEY!!?? Interviewer: You must be very happy though? Max? Max? Where's he gone? How does he do that? He's the hero that Goodwood deserves, but not the Faaaaaaaan Car Formula-E needs right now!!
I swear despite the fast cars that been on this track, this is by far the only one that actually looks as if it's moving fast, it's as if it's a giant r/c car lol
Can we get 20 of these on a race track?
the high speed vacuum cleaner got my respect. even its still ugly as heck ^^
This tiny car really makes big brands look like amateurs, it's faster than Volkswagen time attack monster ID.R and a V10 F1...
Who brought their RC car onto the Goodwood tracks
What on earth did I just watch? 😮😮😮 That's insanely fast.
I saw it in person yesterday and lemme tell you, the video does not do it justice to just how fast this machine is irl. It literally blitzed the entire circuit and everything else. Awesome machinery
Was the steward at the line making the gesture and face because there was virtually no sound?  That was the impression I was getting
That Batmobile was flying.
Who's the driver?
Amazing! Great driving! Other than the Brabham BT46 F1 car, were there ever any other cars using a fan like this?
I honestly thought some parts of the video was sped up.
Look at the official's reaction @0:01
This car is insane. I’ve never seen anything move like that.
Coal power gotta love it
Game changer not that long ago people said electric cars are uncool this is the coolest thing ive seen in years.
Wow...just wish you started a fraction earlier, because the sound of this thing winding up is phenomenal.
Little Monster 😁
That is FAST
And this sums up why I can't watch Formula E: if electric cars are capable of THIS speed, I won't start watching it until they become the pinnacle of electric motorsport (Like F1 for the combustion/hybrid engines). Watching some electric dishwashers going around tight walls with no grip whatsoever is just pointless.
What on earth did I just watch.  That looked like the old bad movies where they just upped the playback speed to make it look fast.
Vw: we are gonna break the record using our finely tuned, thoroughly researched, pikes peak record holder, VW Id.R. McMurtry: HAHA SMOL BOY GO BRRRRRR
The car is much smaller than VW ID    Who is the provider for it's electric engine?
Formula E, learn how to do a car... TY
Ngl if Formula E was like this, I would watch it.
0:02 That guy just threw up his hands lol
did the driver just go at the start ? seems like he had no signal to start at that moment :D
gentlmen at the start almost jumped up in surprise... can u imagine? he gave start to such monsters but even so, he was not ready for this :D
Cars like this are truly terrifying, the fact that there is no combustion engine sound, just a whirring fan, screeching tires and the woosh of the wind, is so ominous.
PD please get this car in Gran Turismo *stat* 😭😭😭
meh 😒 electric toys lol trash,,, let's see wat they can do at the 24 hours of LM endurance racing wit restrictions, no electric nonsense car would survive even 3 or 4 hours 🤣
It's ugly. But it's Hella fast. Wonder what the state of the Battery, Motors and Inverter was after that, must have got stinking hot!
Uhm what.. that's like a freaking spaceship, that speed.
Impressive just like the mighty PORSCHE 919 EVO...  I LOVE THIS CAR❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love the huge collective “WOAH” from the crowd as the car flies past them
Nice 👍
Holy shoot! That thing is fast!
Was there to witness this and I was utterly shocked! Incredible speed
Amazing! First electric racecar I could watch on a track. Because of it's sound 😁
omg!!!
These things should be formula e! Not the slow doritos.
mans flying a drone in the cockpick, who would of thought.
I am glad that I clicked the stream at the right moment to watch this monster car broke the record, I thought I saw a rocket in a second,never seen a car passing by so fast like this, incredibly fast.
So, if you go to the web-site for this car, and read up on it.  It says it weighs less than 1000kg, and can produce 2000kg of downforce from a standing start.  That means you could literally PARK this car upside down as long as the fan has power.
That's the beauty of EV. Instant torque, enormous power also can be generated from such a small size powerplant inside the tiny car. Nevertheless, what a machine and what a racer!! Wondering if someday an EV can break top fuel dragster record.
easy to make records with a car that don't have to respect rules and with a fan, we want to remember what were able to make the chaparral j2 and the brabham bt46 with the fans? fake record
Drivers are gonna need pressure suits at this rate. There's only so many g a human can take before they blackout
thats some jet
I wonder g forces in the corners ?
This video looked sped up.  Seriously, that was freakishly fast!  BTW, the car seems very narrow to me.  Or is it just the video?
It looks like a slot car the way it goes around the race course.
It looks like the mini version of the batmobile so cute
Holy f***
The launch!!!! With the dust kicked up from the suction fans it looks, and sounds, like a rocket being fired! Just incredible.
Not only that thing is fast. That's some insane driving skill as well.
The pinnacle of British engineering,  was amazing to watch, never seen anything like it
0:24 0:33 that jet fighter sound 😳
If only it was as beautiful as it was speedy
When I first saw this car I thought it's an RC car or something. Looks a bit funny but its speed is no joke 😅
shout out to all the experts in yesterdays video that said something like yeah its cool but it wont get the record
🚲 ⚡
this car looks amazing
La vache !!
As fast as our DHL guy on Friday afternoon when we are waiting in front of the door, but considered “not reachable”
The batman car is real!!! Wow this isso really very fast.
This is epic, but the Pastrana Subaru is the coolest car of 2022
Looks like it was built for the track at Goodwood, so tiny and maneuvered so nimble in the chicane.
A real fan car damn
That’s some amazing footage 😍🔥
This thing looks comically fast lol
Accepting the many current limitations of the day-to-day use of Electric vehicles, the most avid of the ICE champions would really need to have their head six feet underground to not be able to see what is coming down the track.
Bruce Wayne on the track “does it come in black”
Poor guy in the top right corner when it starts at 0:01. Caught by surprise!
wow
Why don’t they put a Ferrari f2004 up there? Oh right because it would be faster
That's a ufo on wheels
*ANYONE ELSE* starting to notice they associate the high pitched WHHHHIIIIIZZZZZZZ of the electric motor with speed  And the Brrrrrrrrr of a V8 with historic vehicles???
Jeez!  It's almost cartoonishly fast.
You can use it for road cleaning aswell. 😂😂 Impressive time, car has the perfect size for this Goodwood run. 💪🏿
It has to be the next Batmobile in the next Batman movie. It just has to be.
I want this car in gran turismo lol
That thing is ELECTRIC.. I'm a big FAN!
0:01 McMyrty Jumpscare
That was pretty amazing, especially the amount of grip in the corners.
The dude in the right got startled by the car taking off!
The camera man: 👈👉👈👉👈👉👈👉👈👉👉👈👉👈👉👈👉👈👉👈👉👈👉👈
Just saw this live. Nothing wow'd the crowd more than this as it flew past. Absolutely astonishing performance.
Esa mierda se pega del suelo literalmente!!
How many hours on a charger after that. But big Bravo Zulu anyway.
Is this the best Goodwood run you've ever seen?  Definitely not! It's about as interesting as an electrical toy
I'm gonna tell my son  This is the real life Batmobile
I'm working trackside on this event and every time this thing went past it felt like I was living in slow motion and everything else in double speed. It has 2000 pounds of down force created by serious onboard fans just to keep it on the track.
It's should be called a rocket , not a car
😳  A human sized R.C. you can drive in!
IDR be sad now also
Think I might start shipping with DHL
Clearly this car broke the rules and as such should be eliminated from the record books.   And I’m surprised others haven’t said this as in no way was it allowed to be shot out of that cannon at the beginning.
The engineering behind that car is extraordinary!! Must be a proud moment to set a new record at goodwood. 10 years from now electric vehicle's are going to be mind-blowingly fast the way those fans create that downforce even at a standstill is extreme!! Congratulations 🎉
Japanese e K-Car with some Murray LMP sizzling
They should make a road version called asthma edition.
Incredible commitment for such little track time
Why was the guy raging at the start?
Funny that you call that hill! That‘s flat!
Back to the future: science fact!
Even the old man at the beginning was impressed
wowsa that's commitment
yeap thats marketing at its best. well done to the company breaking the record. win on sunday sale on monday
That slingshot launch was unreal. I had to play it again to catch it!
Had to check if I had Youtube on 1.5x speed.   That thing is RAPID.
We need this in Gran Turismo 7.
Those hay bales would totally stop all those people being obliterated if a car lost control👌🏼
I like the batmobil
Almost cartoonishly fast. Love the reation of the timing guy. "Where did it go ?"
Half expected to see batman driving it
Fan cars are next level of fast. No wonder f1 ban them long time ago. F1 fan cars would simply be too fast even for top drivers in the world
Alicia Keys starts singing: 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 This CAR is on fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 This CAR is on fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  Well done!
Awesome footage but i'm also curious : will the crowd be safe when a car with that speeds makes a mistakes and crashes ?
The reactions of the guys on the start line says it all!
Description seems to have forgotten the ID.R's 39.9 second run in 2019.
I’m seriously in shock
0:02 my reaction is the same as the guy on the starting line lmao
why electric car had exhaust fumes from the back
Wow just wow, this is incredible!
That's not a car, it a rocket 😲🤣
that thing racing at pikes peak?
Somewhere in Texas, Jim Hall is probably having a quiet chuckle at seeing a fan car take to the track again, fifty years since his Chaparral 2J's debut.
Do they have magnets underneath the track, or what? TGV on track, nice!
Sounds like a jet engine
"just off to get some milk love"
Boring noise.
Fighter-jet fast! If the hill had been any longer, Max might have achieved lift-off! And lunar orbit!
The guy who was forgetable in F1 now manages to tame such a beastly car. Respect
Sounding like a fighter jet on the runway
Why is there a lot of smoke coming from the exhaust
Show me an ICE car beating this😂
It's like a mini bat mobile.
LET'S GOOOOO
Hey batman called he wants his car back. That's amazing
The future of Motorsport... Either Time Attack style laps/hillclimbs or full-on wheel to wheel circuit racing. I'm down..
That start is hilarious
Whoa.... Nothing else but WHOA! ;-)
That little chicane where stone is was amazingly quick.
I thought the benefit, or “party trick” of this car was its vacuum. Why does it have a wing?
What a vacuum cleaner.
Rocketship 🚀
i cannot tell if this is real or not
Here in America we call that "TRUCKIN"
thats insane.
my fibre optic shed a tear trying to catch-up with this beast.
Just looks absolutely stuck onto the road like it's riding on rails ... The downforce on this is mind boggling
ok yeah very fast, but the last lap from the 992 gt3 cup was also amazing. that guy pushed it far over th limit but managed to held it
😲😲😲
It looks like sped up 80s movie footage
CLAWDDDD CLAWD that thang is FAST!!
Wowsers, that things a road rocket.
WHY are there not TWO categories for the record?? WHY?? EV's are no comparison to petrol cars. There should be a record for petrol and one for EV's. WHY???  And DHL is, by far, the worst of the shipping companies. They are SLOW!
Amazing!  Huge congratulations to all at McLovin who made this possible.   I've never been into elecrification until now, but this has really opened my eyes to it. Specacular. More power to your elbow, gents! X🥂
Why were fan cars banned from F1?
I wonder how many deaths will be counted once a car like this goes lawn mowing... Does the entrance ticket for GW state that it's to be visited at own risk? 50's safety technology haha
Amazing! There will be a horrible accident one day imo
Where are ice fanboys now? Give us v8 sound, mwah mwah
Whatever is powering that thing I would say the Batmobile shares a similar drivetrain lol this thing is a guided missile.
It was like footage was sped up immense.
0:02 The first guy reaction 😂lol🚀
Its cool, but it lacks emotion. Its like watching a golf tournament on TV. lol
that is a rocket
that thing is nuts :)
Can't wait to try that on GT7
DHL's add at the end of this is ridiculous. One more time, there is no AGW/ACC. Learn some history.
Долбаное электрогавно
What an insane display. That's gonna be hard to beat
That was a foking rocket ship.
The star of the show
All I can do is laugh.
Amazing car!
This machine is insane
Look at the marshal at the front, he raises his hands in disbelief and couldn't believe how brutally it launched off the line.
Would love to see this amazing piece of engineering at the Pikes Peak Hillclimb!
Truly unexciting. Boring in fact. I bet if you attach it to a rail you can make it go even faster. EVs are the death nail. Next will be a segway
I know it's a bit of a cliché to call cars with rear wings 'batmobiles', but to me this absolutely seems like something batman would drive
I feel ashamed but, what's the name of this car 😅
That thing is a rocket ship! I’m staggered at how fast that thing is!!
This is a modern day chaparral 2j
OMG!!!! Crazy
0:01 Dude on the right got scared
Looks like a candidate for a Batmobile...just need the afterburner.
IN-FARKING-SANE !!  mind blown....
And that was a Marussia driver ladies and gentlemen
走るジェット機みたいなサウンドが素敵。
It looks so sick too, well deserved
Lil rocket should be the name for the car 🤣
Electrics Cars..sucks..!!
I just watched it at 0.75 speed and it still looks like a machine that can only be driven by an alien with 4 arms and 2 brains to deal with this insane agility. This is like from a different dimension!
it's like if a ginetta took tren
It was bound to happen after that first run
Crikey, anyone got a spare pair of clean undies?
That drive has ice in his veins!!!
Literally checked to see if my playback speed was set to something higher than 1.0x
So f1 cars are gonna be allowed to be timed up the hill right?? Or no just let these purpose built cars up
Bruh this is ballistic, this is the closest speed you imagine a car goes in your dreams 💀
Well done Max. Awesome!
Imagine that up pikes peak
For all its incredible speed and grip, it sounded like my food mixer !
👍👍👍
Like Forest Gump says " that's all I have to say about that!" 🤣
Is this on ffwd?
He was truly determined to smash the record
"Atomic Batteries to Power! Turbines to Speed!"
Titanium Cohones on that one, DANG!!!
Damn, this car is fast. Kinda looks like a mini bat-mobile.
🙂👍🏻
Wow that car literally sucks!
Is it a fan car? Active downforce
Such a pity electric is so dull, fast, but dull
Man that thing is bookin’. ICE is done. It’s over.
Another nail in the coffin for internal combustion and petrol heads, but a impressive machine never the less.
Airplane?
Fantastic. Shame the video coverage isn't on par with no graphic or nothing. At least you spared us the music, wrong audio, etc
I genuinely thought I was on 2x play speed
batman car
Such speed attacks in Goodwood are dangerous to  a visitors, aren"t they?
Watch how the linemen flinched when the car launched! Edit: the car had a dust trail behind it!! Edit #2: the driver got balls!
This car puts Lewis Hamilton F1 car to shame!
The real driving simulator
next step is pikes peak
It’s a Rocket!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
*HOLYFUDGE*
told ya !
This video is going to blow up soon
i guess theyll do pikes peak next......
Holy cow.....!!!....that "thing goes like "S***"!!!.....oh yes.......but it's "electric".......😂
is that Bottas driving lol
Somewhere a Chaparral 2J is smiling.
runs like a toy slot-car
If you ever wondered if the fan device on a race car really had to be banned from competition - here is your answer. It is impressive but it also takes away a lot from what a genuine race car is. This car is absolutely planted and looks more like a high speed train than a car. It actually is much closer to a RC toy car than a real car.
Damn
This is probably as close as we are getting to the Red Bull X2011 irl
Absolutely monstrous
Ooh! That was quick!
First electric car to impress me. Quite an achievement.
Looks sped up
Electric,... boring,...
Quite fast
Pikes Peak!
I start to like hoovering.☺️
Had to double check my playback speed.
Imagine de-throning a giant like Volkswagen.. Well done
That. Is. Insane.
I’d watch Formula E if they were all driving these.
That thing is rapid! Its not even fast forward video
So this is what a Formula Student and a Volkswagen Id.R baby looks like
it's so fast that the end screen had to be on halfway through
The future has arrived.
It's refreshing to actually hear the car and not the two jerk offs with the diarrhea of the mouth.
This probably looks even more surreal in person.
Will they have a crack at pikes peak?
Gd job cameracrew
This car very2 fast n smooth sound.. tomorrow I want borrow my mother money to buy this car.. 💤💤
The wind sound is awesome.
It would be interesting to know the average speed and highest speed of that run That is an incredible machine!
I wonder how fast this can lap the Nurburgring.
Just as reference, this is a standing start and the car AVERAGED over 107mph for the run.
Holy shitballs Batman.
Are we going to start looking at ways to reduce car speeds, either via road changes (putting in chicanes/bus stops as F1 did due to cars being too fast) or limiting the age/power of timed vehicles? - I remember the first design/route of the road course being rejected because you found cars were/would be travelling too fast thus have we now reached that time with the current hill course?
Meh. I didn’t think you could go so fast while still seeming so boring. All the speed ans danger without any of the exciting sounds.
Talk about full send. Excellent driving.
It really goes 'Woosh' when it goes past! It's incredible.
Its electric car, so opinions discarded
Could it be that the roar of a piston engine starts to indicate that the car is slow? A bit worrying for me but if the results are impressive who cares? Or do we?!
Congrats to Max Chilton and the whole McMurty Automotive Team! What a breathtaking machine!
I wanna see a series where they can go all out with driving aids. abs, tcs, active suspension, fans, you name it. Just show me how fast a car can really go
Just years back 1 minute would considered unbeatable, the Electric vehicles truly are insane. but still, the sound or rather lack of sound just doesnt hit the spot.
That thing is an actual rocket
This is crazy, I’m blown away
it looks sped up
We need a racing series with these things 🤯
This thing needs a spec series
FREAKIN’ WOW!!!♥️🏁🏆😮
But can she pikes peak?
Wow
Scalextric will sell millions of these!!!!!
Na na na na na na na na na na na na BATMAN!
As it came around molcom corner and the crowd in unison went, " WHhoOOAAA" = So Cool :-)
Что это за машина
I cant believe a fan car beat VW's multimillion dollar electric race car project
that look fast bro
Although its sound like a crying baby this car is very fast
If contemporary LMP1, LMH, F1, etc were allowed to ‘push’ going up the hill this would’ve been a more impressive record to have broken. As it is I can only think that this was a pre planned “record break”, otherwise why was it allowed to go up full speed when so many others aren’t?
The dust coming off the fan really gives off the impression that it's contstantly breaking the sound barrier. Sounds like it too!
that's insanely fast!!
And then Max said it could go even faster......and it's going to Silverstone next week.  Guys, stop laughing. *_Seriously, what if this thing ACTUALLY shows up the Formula One cars?_* IDK if F1's rep could take that blow....and I wanna find out.
Woow what a monster car.. that would be fun to drive trugh town..
and at some point it's gonna go wrong and they'll be a catastrophic accident possibly killing more than just it's driver, looks horrendously dangerous!!!
I can understand how you steer that thing..............wow
I live very near to Renishaws and have been been watching the development of this with much interest - but I never expected this - its as if the film had been speeded up
Bit of the same feeling as when I saw SpaceX land those rockets for the first time. Actual next level technology. That's astonishingly fast.
I never saw something look so fast as this thing. It's amazing. I want it
Bruh
Its so fast that the cameras cant focus!!!!!!😲😲😲😲😲
Super quick, a bit squirrely looking but sure that will get ironed out
How many times did you have to watch this run to get your head around it? Be honest 😂
Just Great!
I never thought I'd see a car which looks more glued to the track than the 2021 F1 Mercedes. Very impressive.
Rocket ship
Why are F1 cars not doing record runs
sad this does not include the standstill before the launch.. with the "turbines" spooling up..
eXtreme
For reference the VW I.D.R’s time was 39.90
Hi Adrian Newey and RedBull Racing, I think it's time you guys think of something about the X concepts.
So quick the video feels like it's on fast-forward!!
Congrats to them! Amazing team and amazing car. Im wondering if they will attempt pikes peak next, tho i doubt it has enough juice for that.
Legendary 🔥🔥🔥
i saw it on the stream.. i was godsmacked..
Incredible! Gotta bet on the driver bing sick after getting out?!
That thing looks like a rocket, just insane
A tiny batmobile
Talent!!!
Jeez it was like it was on a massive stretched elastic band at the beginning, 0-Morbillion in a blink. That marshall pooped himself!
Modern F1 would beat that.
That boi is   m   o   o   v    i    n
How does it work?
It looks like it went thru powerpoint image formatting 💀Great car tho super fast cos of the light weight
It looks (and sounds) like it sucks itself to the ground like a vacuum cleaner.. Edit: Ah that's actually how it gets its downforce...
Now they need to go on the Ring !
What a car, that thing give me some fear. Silent, agile and small.
Reminds "Super pursuit" of the knight rider 😅
i HATED the thought of EV vehicles replacing my combustion engines,always loved screaming turbos/screaming n/a with lots of cylinders but as time goes on im starting to embrace ev so much more.the potential and character makes them very competetive
Based on the footprint of 1960s F1 cars I think we all know what needs to happen now...
DHL just made the ad of the year.
It looks sped up no joke
Here to witness history
per dio che missile! 🚀🚀
I want one..  ...... Wait......  I'm broke 🤣
Yep. Time for a new spec series with these.
*laughs in redbull X fan car*
Maybe they need to beef up the crash walls given how fast some of the cars are. If one of them spins out at that speed a lot of people in the crowd might get hurt or worse
The start guy being frightened and shrugging his shoulders in the beginning is literally all of us
That's not a car, that's a fighter jet sucked to the ground.... OMG!
Quite sad that a electric overpowered  kitchen mixer is the fastest now. The 99 McLaren f1 had 780-800hp with rwd no 2000pounds of downforce from zero. You really needed talent and balls to drive it that’s fast. This thing has 1000hp awd and 2000pound downforce from 0 kmh /mph and is as smaal as a 1960s f1 . Its like bringing a rpg to a knife fight. Hopefully some guy makes a combustion engine car with even more horsepower groundeffect and awd and beat the kitchenmixer . Cause if they try so hard ( electric car manufacturers) combustion engine can do it 2
absolutely insane...
So, they've laid some Scalextric rails on the track at Goodwood by the looks of it. Surprised the driver wasn't on the side of the rack with a hand controller.
Volkswagen: ..Oh it's on!!!
The car looks to have so much grip due to the fan, it steers sharply.
Much prefer this over the VW ID.R
I'd pay a yearly subscription to watch these race instead of modern f1
😳
Insane speed even with balls of steel onboard.
My name is Giovanni giorgio but everybody calls me giorgio
I DO HATE ELECTRIC CARS BUT WOW!
this is the future... Just accept, eletric cars... :(
Also curious, are they going to make a real (petrol powered) version of this car? Would be interesting to see what a real one could do!
goofy ahh car
That was INSANE.
Play this at 0.75x speed and that's what a normal run from a normal car would look like.
New record!👏👏👏
First Electric I like 👍 True petrolhead 😎
mind banding)
that was fastttt....
Batman: Lucius, I have a new design for the Batmobile that I want you to look at.
Batmobile
lol the guy at the start baffled by the launch. (insert john travolta meme)
What is this car built for?
not bad for a hoover
This video isn't squashed right? The car actually just looks like that?
The reaction of the guy at the start is priceless
That was incredible!
It spent literally no time at all at Molcomb Corner, there's not enough words that describe how incredible this car is
I want one of these
That thing looks RAPID up the hill, never seen anything like it. McMurtry Spierling, remember the name folks!
It looks so cursed
That car can't have been built by humans!
Looks like a really fast shoe
Absolutely bonkers. Congratulations to all who made this happen.
Please can we somehow get a view of the speedometer or telemetry?  This is an insane machine and an insane drive by Max Chilton!
Volkswagen IDR committed suicide after this news.
i still think there is time to be saved. What an incredible run tho
I would love to see the Porsche 919 Tribute there!
Nice car but potentially a bit too fast?
If you enjoyed, Next step try watching high speed trains fly by...
That thing *GRIPS*
That thing is unbelievably fast! Absolute rocket ship.
Absolutely ballistic, it's like literally watching a missile.
Rocket on wheels 🚀
One word: Capital 'I' Insane!!!!!
I genuinely thought that nothing could beat the VW ID.R, this is something else.
That was unbelievable Nothing like throwing egg in the face of electric car haters Awesome stuff
I bet a lot of gentry at Goodwood are pleased. Brought it home lads, enjoy the moment x Brilliant, just brilliant x
Goodwood is not a place for electric cars...
Damn these kind of electric cars need their own racing series. This looks so much more fun that Formula E.
This is such an EPIC time. It looks sped up, it ain't. The commentators on live stream COULD NOT KEEP UP! Wow, just wow, just like I thought the VW ID.R was going to set a record that stood for 20 years, then here we are. I wonder if this thing has a battery that can last for ... say 7 mins and 56 sec, in say, Colorado, maybe next year? *hint* *wink* *nudge*
0:02 , see the guys body labguageu
Batman is on a hurry
I wonder how it would compare to ID R on a more traditional circuit, where track speeds are higher. The small size really gives it an advantage in this hill climb.
I've watched this video three times. It never gets boring.
Next Nürburgring 🔥🔥
INSANE
it reminds me of the crazy fast but weird looking car in ridge racer series
I want to see it run quater mile
Instant maximum torque output for electric motors. IC engines can never do that.
wow that was fast.
Wow that thing is fast with superb handling and I am no fan of electric cars by any means !
Literally found out about this car 10 mins ago from previous runs, and now this, unreal
Doesn't even sound like an electric car.  Just sounds and looks like a grey version of the Batmobile from Keaton/Nicholson Batman.
i believe it´s the fastest run ,  but is picture  picture a bit modified ?     to promote the "environment friendly"  eclectic car ?
i wanna see the porsche 919 do this
Feels like watching this in 2x
Would be interesting to see what the W11 Mercedes could do if fully sent
919 Evo tribute faster
British engineering at its best 👏👏👏
Youtube SHORTS
Reminds me of the Batmobile LOL
Road legal soon
Faster than Formula E, they need to step up their game
Im surprised its "only" about 1sec faster than the VW. It looks absolutely freakish fast
The tiny size of the car really emphasises the speed. If f1 cars got smaller again they would look amazing too
Maybe next year can be legal a rocket like engine. You can be happy, mission accomplished, you have a useless fastest washing mashine. Sorry but we still hate this tecnology because we love motorsport
He did it!
I'm a big fan of this car.
This thing is literally a road version of the blackbird
The downforce and ground effects, omg
Maybe soon in GT7
One of the marshalls didn't seem to expect that acceleration.
didnt hit the brake at all  basically flat out
What an utterly mental machine, you can’t deny that this is insane
I want Formula E replaced with a field of these cars
That’s ridiculous.
tired of waiting on Gordon Murry? buy this instead 🤣
should be seperated onto an electric category. not fair for other cars
Now *THIS* is pod racing!!!
I wonder where all the people making jokes about barbie jeeps went? Probably couldn't afford internet because they refuse to drive anything over than a diesel pick up xD
Insanely incredibly lovely 😎🚀⚡️⚡️💥👍🏻
So, we cant have f1 going full chat up the hill because it would be increasingly unsafe, but this is ok?
Fan-cars got those cheatcodes. exhibit A as to why they were banned in all motorsport. thats too fast to race side-by-side
What’s the range of this vehicle?
It makes you wonder what will be able to beat that?
Smashed the old record by almost a second, what a car
Modern F1 Cars would still go faster.
This is by far the best possible advertisement for the company. They went from being basically unknown a couple days back to now everyone wanting a ride on their car
Quite a theatrical run. The silent death of noisy gas-powered automobiles. Reminds me of McQueen becoming absolute when new racers appeared in the Piston Cup.
Well that's not fair.......
......
That's utterly bonkers, I'm not a ev fan, but that is bonkers....
I genuinely have never seen anything as fast as that looked on that track.  I thought I'd got playback in 2x mode!  Very impressive and won't forget that for a while!
Unbelievable
Bwoah
Congratulations to the whole team! 🍾
Now THAT is a launch 👀👀😳😳
The Marshall at the beginning got such a fright 😂😂
Pero tiene turbina o que onda?
That thing shifts! The crowd reaction said it all.
madness
EV haters seething right now
Wow.
For those who were expecting time been displayed: 39.081
No, the video isn't sped up
Damn, just damn
Absolutely insane
