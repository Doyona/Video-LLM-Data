Was I the only one who read 2024? Only when I saw the Alfa Romeo I realized my mistake...
That is not the W15, it's the W14 you have in this video. W15 has large side pods and the nose is silver so I don't know where you got those shots from but wrong car and wrong year😅

The testing highlights for day three on track with the f1 drivers.
Redbull engineers are sabotaging Perez Car for Max Verstappen to Win that's  not profesional at All, Oliver should DO something about It. If Max wants to win he can try It by his own.
Time for stroll to be 2nd driver??
Alfa car looks great
Where are the tire types in the timetable??? It helps a lot with getting a better fake understanding!!!!!
I like that music , whats the song name
Another year of absolutely no challenges for the title. Those rule changes have really made the racing closer... On the plus side, the IndyCars are back this weekend too.
Schöner Trailer... 💪🔧🪛🔩
Let’s go Hamilton !!🎉
That alpha looks incredible
Alpha Romeo looks sweet!!
So the cheaters still have the fastest car then
It‘s gonna be another silly season.
I almost feel sorry for alpine. Almost.
Boogity Boogity Boogity, WHEW LETS GOO RACINGGG!!!!
4:00 that Alpine looks like an absolute dog.
I love the early sand bagging! Most of the top teams are still holding back. Cant wait for the season start!
Ocon is a joke as always.
I strongly believe we've got strong 4 teams. RB, Merc, Ferrari and AM. Big expectations towards this season!
Wheres rosannas voiceover
Checo’s the man.
Let’s go checo
GLAD TO HEAR WILL BUXTON VOICE AGAIN!!!
Does anybody know the name of Drugovich's sunglasses?
OH NO, HONG KONG NO F1 LIVE
Feel bad for Seb
Can someone tell me what is the song used ?
I've never understood why the pit crew of "most" teams in F1 are the "most" well, portly - here's to you aston martin for 2023. I suppose it doesn't matter if they only need 2.1 seconds to perform there duties during a race.
Even if Lewis don't win 8th hopefully he can add to his 103 wins and try and push it further out of reach
The wording on the Bottas red flag is needlessly putting the blame on the driver. It's not hard to say it was caused by the car rather than the driver when it's a mechanical issue instead of a crash.
Let go, redbull! Honda engine is op.
Muivien el tiempo de Fernando a lonso🙋‍♂️

This anti Checo agenda is getting pretty tiresome.
Body painting
Bottas P3, just a hair behind Hamilton P2, a bit bigger hair behind Perez P1.
what's with the green paints on the cars?
Mclaren's car look like something coming from Aliexpress.
❤❤❤
AYER VI LOS LEONE POR ESO QUIERO BERLO DE NUEVO

What are those attachments behind the wheels and the rear?
🙌🙌❤️🇲🇽🇲🇽
Black arrow 🤣
Just been watching the first day testing 2023 in Bahrain.  Can anyone tell me why Piastris car 81 has the black camera?   Thought being No.2 driver he would have the yellow camera…… they are confusing viewers by switching.

Whats crybaby lulu still doing here?
Norris is confident his car will be in the top twenty.
F1 super season.
My class Can’t stand my love to formula 1 cause I’m a big fan lol and they were tired one of them got sent to detention after saying a swear word to make me upset but it didn’t everyone was shocked I said all champions-
I can’t wait for another season of Ferrari having a championship car and blowing it
go AM
A Maria é linda
dispointed that F1 has no broadcasting partner this year in India. and F1 tv pro subs is too much for some. hope they sort this out in next season.
I really hope we don't get one team whom is super dominant this season, but several and close fight races
I am hoping the 2023 F1 Season is a banger next week.
1:15 did they finally add a DRS zone here?
0:22 what net iron?
Ocon even after outgrowing Piere still at P14 and the short guy at P12 is some outgrown talent. Bonjour.
We want Turkish Grand Prix 🇹🇷🇹🇷
😅Bottas still stay with Hamilton
WOW. thanks Paul,
If an Aston Martin beats Mercedes all be blown away
Ferrari on trouble
Promising pace from Yuki! Let's see if he can step up his game this year!!
1:13 "Russell blasting past" are we watching the same clip as the commentary?  Look like it stalled when it pulled out of the slipstream even with DRS.
I am entering season 2023 as a fan of the sport only and not any particular team. I was cheering on Red Bull between 2019 and 2022 but after Max and Red Bull's treatment of Sergio in 2022 I honestly don't care for they don't win another race while Verstappen is driving for them.   I should enjoy the season more so I am excited, no added stress of cheering on anyone specific.  I was often big critic of Lewis, but I honestly hope he will do well in 2023, as I hope for Charles and Fernando as well.   For me this year it's all about racing,not teams or any individual drivers, ofcourse as season unfolds, story is being developed, this may change 😄  Happy 2023 to all of you F1 needs!!!
Can't wait until next week. I'm all in for this season
Vamos Checo!
Is this a season when we could expect more battles from Hamilton and Alonso, oh, I just want their cars to be similar :)
This is a serious opportunity for Drugovich, maybe...
For once it would be nice for one of the midfield cars breaking into the championship fight. 😢
Tener mi casa propia
Aston Martin looks like a much more complete package with better drivability and more stable overall performance than Alpine at this stage, of course only based on what we've seen in these 3 days. Hoping for a strong season for this rookie, Fernando!
Do you want to be the car that has peaked in the first weekend... Or do you want to be the car that is fast and still has a lot of things to work out???
11
It's getting worse and worse in Germany...  Only 4 races last year... This year none in free TV. Just saw some parts of race  by Sky and it was bad... So bad that even some F1 Teams denied to give interviews...  I want rtl back as since my childhood back in the 90's
AM finally cobble together a competitive John Deere just as Seb leaves😭💔at least tho it can maybe give Nando a few last hurrahs to sign off on!
Drugo should have a seat what a shame, he as an amazing driver
Maclaren taking another step back from what we've so far.
There are levels to this sport… All these youngsters are about to learn what it’s like to compete against Fernando in a reliable and competitive car. The final boss has arrived.
i hope this year hamilton would not go out of racing lines 1000 times before he gets a warning
alpha romeo car design drives me crazy
F1 and their Mickey Mouse red flags.
Ocon driving an indycar?
I think it's safe to say Max is getting a three peat
“Russel blasting past and leclerc backing without space “ loool made my day
Drugooooo
Didnt redbull get restrictions on testing aspart of there punishment for over speend ?????
McLaren's Google Chrome tyre rims are brilliant
seb in astn martin this year would have been fire.
No Silver Arrow anymore - is a black Arrow 🔥🔥🔥
✨Oscar S🅱️innastri✨🇦🇺
It looks to be an amazing season ahead. Silver Arrows are black arrows now.
Looks like Red Bull got the pair of the largest horns to take them all, but everybody else are not willing to make things easier for them. Most exciting!
Yawn.....
I say Red Bull, Mercedes, Ferrari and Aston Martin are looking strong! 😃
Of course Aston is fast when Seb gone
Hope fully be a closer fight this year. It looked like redbull ramped up the power for Perez final runs. I personally think ferrari kept the power low and are not showing full potential. Hard to tell with Mercedes so far but they appear to be in a better position than this time last year.
I feel more and more sad that vettel may have lost the chance for a win by retiring ;-;
I don't know if the pundits ever read the comments,  But Checo's last name is accentuated in the first syllable, not the last. PErez, not PerEz. Maybe adjust that please?
Where is Max?
Alonso will finish ahead of Hamilton.
The First Race Next weekend is gonna be a movie 🍿
Redbull is more faster than any other car there 😢again 😔
McLaren gonna be the worst team? That would be hilarious
Russel barely overtake Leclerc even with the Drs. English commentary: "BLASTING PASS" 🤡
Drugoviches beautiful car is going to get destoryed by Strulovich
Red bull on top again, boooooooooooooorrrrriiiinnnngggggg
Just here wondering what could have been if the Aston Martin line-up would have been Seb and Alonso... That would have been something!
Where was Stroll?
So you have bought you in to be a test driver ( for millions ) , and you  can't drive  these 3 days ?  only for driver nr 1 and 2 hahaha strange hey ?
if red bull are the quickest car again then the wind tunnel penalty wasnt enough and the FIA should be more than ashamed of themselves. Cheating is not acceptable. Ever. They should be fast enough to win races but not so fast that its a struggle and luck that wins races for other teams.
seeing mclaren nosedive after the way they treated daniel is 🤌
my prediction F1 2023: 1. RedBull       OR       1. Redbull         OR        1. Ferrari                            2. Ferrari                     2. Mercedes                  2.

Knowing Mercedes' style of sandbagging for testing, I think it's safe to say that the Merc is easily the fastest car, at least for the first few races. It will be interesting to see how RB catches up and if Ferrari will continue their streak of clowining around whenever they have a competitive package (which seems to be the case). But the most exciting thing by far about this season is the prospect of Fernando Alonso in a fast and reliable car. Just imagine him battling Lewis just like 15 years ago, when many from the current grid were just getting in a go-kart for the first time. It would be insane
Alonso
Interesting to see that alpine and McLaren are seemingly struggling more than everyone else, with them being top of midfield as of last year
Indycar today,F1 next month!so pumped
Fun facts: if Charles wins with his number 16 on his car, it will be the first title for Ferrari after 16 years and 16th drivers title for Scuderia. Plus, Enzo Ferrari won his first race 100 years ago. Plus, movie Ferrari comes out this year - directed by legendary Michael Mann. 😀
0:05 Checo 0:45 Bottas 1:13 Russell  1:28 Charles  1:51 Hamilton  2:21 Drugovich  3:05 Oscar/McLaren 4:02 Ocon 4:22 Positions
Lewis is winning the 2023 season and becoming the Undisputed greatest of all time
One of the things I love most about the Bahrain track is all the greenery.  It's just like Spa,  with forests everywhere you look.
COME ON LEWIS 44❤
Drugovich is extremely impressive 👏👏👏
Everything said was superficial, speculative or obvious. Waste of time until an actual race happens.
O problema todo com a Aston Martin é que o Alonso representa o passado. Observem que piloto competente jovem rende muito mais e evoluir é o caminho.
El 🅱️LAN
😎
talking about testday as if they were racing is just silly.
Why he said 'over steer' when lewis went outside of the track, wasn't it understeer?
Title number 3 nailed on for Max.
Its time for lewis
CHECO
開幕戦フェルスタッペン頑張れ👍
RB19 looking tough!! Pretty sure it'll be a 1 n 2 finish for Max and Sergio.
I can't stand the Mclaren livery.. Would be so cool if they returned it to the malbora colours, just without the logo.
I hope the FIA doesn't ruin this season.  Let's Go!
Please just not another boring Redbull season
what's the background music title? anyone? 😁
Bruh Aston get a better car once Seb already retired. Thats just sad
why doesnt f1 have subtitles on YT?
A whole day testing and the official F1 channel gets 4 mins of highlights???  Do better
“Blasting pst the Ferrari” I don’t think so😂
There is no DrS on back straight  is there?
Let's see how genuine the pace of AM is.
Alfa Romeo #1 and #3 in the last 2 Pre season test runs 💪🍀🍀💪
RB , Ferrari , Mercedes , Alfa , Aston
This year going to be so much fun!!!
why do i feel like drives are lower than they used to in the seat ?
One week! Let's Goooo!
33
looks like a long season for McLaren fans
this season looks like it’s gonna be an absolute blast
King max to break all records
Much better Mercedes, much better. Hope we are sandbagging too!
Vroom Vroom 🎉
F1 2023 YES!
Not gonna lie, but Toto looks super confident this time 😉
McLaren really needs to change their upper management.
Yessss! Glad to see Hamilton back in the top 3! The Aston seems quite promising especially in nandos hands bit we don't know what to expect till the season starts
@ Will Buxton,  Nay nay! Bottas not an alpha man ;-)
Ese es nuestro checoooo!!!!!
The cars look really badass this year with all the black colors.
MCL60 pls don't embarrass us in Bahrain 🙏
Man, the 22-23 car is the best-looking Formula 1 car in the past decade or so. They all look stunning. The shape, the usage of glossy black, and the vibrant accents on every car, *chef's kiss*.
Just give the drive to Drugovich and leave Stroll at home for the season.
🏎️💨🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🚀
This season gonna be fun. Mercedes is anyway sandbagging.
The Alfa's livery at night looks stunning 😲
That Merc looks more reliable than last year. I can feel it.
Hold up, anyone gunna question the BLASTING! past leclerc xD didn't look like a blasting to me but that's just me
Hardly blazing past the Ferrari - more like late breaking
So over dramatic.
That McLaren livery is really nice but it looks like they've made an absolute dog of a car.
I like Perez but across the race length he struggles to be as fast as Max
As soon as the merc pulled out of slipstream  it went backwards against the ferarri.... Still looks draggy
„Wheelbrow“ 💀
❤❤FORZA FERRARI❤❤
Lance Stroll need to stand aside
Guys please… moment of silence for McLaren 😐
Man all you people think these results mean anything haha. Aston Martin will still be backmarker
Forget Monaco - imagine them racing in the town of Chillingbourne.
Russell with DRS and still couldn’t overtake Leclerc clearly. Merc has a tough time ahead
💐
Hahaha I hope mclaren fail this year 😂
this year gonna be redbull year again!
Russell you  have only one task- to destroy Lewis.
Why on earth everyone has to say "the Monégasque" after Leclerc's name is beyond me. Yes we get it, he's from Monaco.... This doesn't make you smart.
Thanks
If Perez is  0.4  seconds ahead of lewis, that means  Max will be  0.8  seconds ahead of lewis.
Bisa benerin plafon Accord yang ngampleh gak pak dokter?
Is Alpha Romeo going to be a top team?!
"And Drugovich" Essa pequena parte da minha vida se chama felicidade
Checo next champion 🏎️🚀🚀🚀
Riccardo is laughing 😂
Drugovich should just take the seat. Whoops, there I go typing out loud again.
RedBull are cheats thanks Netflix
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
I know it's not the most important thing but the Alfa Romeo's aesthetic superiority is mesmerizing 🤩
McLaren... Ohh...McLaren... If you not fixed the Cars you'll will Lost all the precious you have....
Wishing for Red Bull
Alonso will be champion 2023
Conductor ij seen U  hahahahi
HAMMERTONEE
how was de vries 8 seconds off?
It looks like Mercedes are still going to struggle this year.  Maybe it's time to dump the zero pods design, quickly, like now.  The Red Bull is menacing.  Aston Martin HAS improved significantly.  The only team that I think is sandbagging is Ferrari.  Alfa Romeo is going to be solid midfield.   McLaren are in trouble.
Daniel dodged a bullet
HAMILTON P2 BABYY
Sky Sports F1 and Mercedes collusion needs to be ended.  Watching Toto Wolfe use Sky sports to spread a rumor or other wise benefit is not right.  You call the race 100% neutral the world deserves a non biased race call and coverage.  Maybe its time to replace the current company who is calling the race.  Let neutral Americans call the race. They do it well in Nascar and Indy car with our working directly for one team.
McLaren looking awful lol.
Yeahhh Ferrari
Started watching formula 1 because of Sebastian Vettel with Red Bull. For me, the track feels so empty as was unable to find the car number 5.
That Alfa Romeo is just just gorgeous
Kinda promising tbh hopefully it’s close through the top four or five teams. 🤞🏼
Let all take a minute to remember that we lost two great, entertaining pilots in the last two seasons. No-one seems to be ready to take the succession.  Maz, Goatify, we miss you guys!
How 33?
Checo Pérez próximo campeón del mundo! 🏆
I really really really think RB is sandbagging
Oscar pia-spin is our new spinner  The maze-spin curse is back
Mclaren should start to build her own engine now..
I hope AMR will stay in front of Mercedes 😎
Lance, take a break next week
McLaren seem to always shoot themselves in the foot
Hope to see a  VER HAM BOT  This season but better yet, a  PER ALO BOT
McLaren seem to always shoot themselves in the foot
The downfall of mclaren, let's gooo
Every team needs an Alonso.
I think this season will be much more interesting than last year.
So a 4-way fight for pole position in the season opener? :)
Ocon had his ffb set too high
McLarens are falling behind really fast!
We all know who the top three will be. The rest of the pack is just fight for the fourth spot on the constructors ladder
Finally Mercedes 😎😎
2:55 glasses? Pls anyone
Meaning it's red bull Honda season again??? Ferrari slow???
Since 1st time pre-season held in Bahrain, never again the program collapsed like in Barcelona or South Africa. It's very successful and reduce team expenses with the 1st race of the season also held in the same venue.
Like disco channel, pity there’s no music channels showing F1
I'm so amped for this season. Excited to see how the newcomers look, and of course how the championship will play out. Here's hoping to a great season with tons of exciting races.
In other breaking news it is now confirmed Nicolas Latfi has commenced his last lap at Abu Dhabi
I don't expect significant changes in competitiveness compared to last year. RB will be the fastest, followed by Ferrari with Mercedes close. McLaren, Alpine in the midfield, Alfa, AT, Aston towards the back, Haas, Williams at the bottom. That will be the status for the next 2-3 years. It takes time, often years plus reg changes to shake up the status quo. It can't be done in a year.
Strolls gonna get dropped 🤣🤣
Finally Checo checks in! 🇲🇽
Alfa Romeo looks Strong and beautiful
Drugovich !!!!! 🔥💚💛
Vamos checo
I'm really looking forward to the Alonso/Stroll lineup. I think Alonso will be the faster of the two but I'm expecting Stroll to surprise this season.
LW andando 0.359seg atrás de uma red bull? vem o 8° hein, tão deixando a gente sonhar
Seeing the comments...it seems like a paid section trying to create over the moon excitement. Liberty media doing its thing.
Aww poor McLaren got punched in the face by karma.
Red Bull will dominate yet again. With a few wins by the reds and the Mercs finishing third again. Testing means nothing. Max will dominate again his car is just better. (I’m a Merc fan)
Wonder if Red Bull will find another way to cheat.
why is this video not watchable in germany?
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Paint - branding is integral to F1. All bodywork should carry paint except the floor. Skipping paint to save weight should not be allowed.
This is quite shocking and devastating that F1 denied the broadcasting deal with star sports and Hotstar in india.... We fans condemn it....😔🥺
Dear formula 1.... Huge fan from India. Kindly broadcast the races with sole broadcasting channels. Bcoz no body gonna subscribe the f1 TV pro. And F1 races are not something which u enjoy in mobile. Moreover the mobile internet speed is not upto the mark to enjoy full details of the races. So kindly broadcast it via some TV channel, like star sports, sony sports etc.
Alguna vez le dirán Sergio Pérez y no Seryio Peréz?
That pair of sunglasses by Drugovich 🔥🔥🔥
Wow so little mention of Perez considering all the rumors and his obviously excellent form.
Goes to show that breaching the budget cap to gain an unfair advantage has zero consequences, that the penalty was inconsequential and that the BS from Horner complaining how hard they'd be hit were just that: the usual Horner's BS and hypocrisy.
Aston ascending F1 fighting for who will win
Mclaren still slow
Go "CheCo"!
Max is gonna take his 3th championship 🐐
this year is goin to be intiristing
If you are a Ferrari fan, you might want to turn away. I could be wrong, but I don't think Ferrari has enough. After Charles set the fastest time on the C4, Carlos at one point was trying to beat it and got very close. That led me to believe the Ferrari was maxed out on the C4. Then, of course Perez went on to set the fastest time (also on the C4) of the 3 days and was more than 0.7 sec faster than the Ferrari and if it was Verstappen it could have been over 1 sec. The only difference was Perez set his time after sun down, so the cooler conditions could have partially contributed to his fast time. Having said that, Bottas in the Alfa (with the same Ferrari engine) also went out to set a fast time after sun down on the C5, although faster than the Ferraris on the C4 was more than 0.5 sec slower than Perez on the C4. If Ferrari was sandbagging, was Alfa sandbagging too? I think unlikely. Oh well, I guess we shall find out soon enough. The other bad news is the word from the paddock is Ferrari's tire deg was terrible. On top of that, the new supposedly more reliable Ferrari engine also broke down on the Alfa. I think even Charles admitted Ferrari needs more if they want to beat Red Bull. So, my prediction is probably more of the same from last season whereby Red Bull may dominate at least at the start of the season. So, development will be absolutely key for Ferrari.
McLaren, please don’t copy red bull if you don’t understand why they use pull rod instead of push rod.
Going to be a great season! Looking forward to it!
I really hope Alonso is fighting for podiums consistently this year
3:48
Where's Daniel Ricciardo?
Is it just me or does anyone else HATE the google chrome logos on the McLaren cars..
So sorry for Mc Laren, yet again
Let's go. Racing please.
Oscar Spinastri
Looks like I missed the first race of the season.
Forza Ferrari 💪!
RB👍
*VAMOS CHECO!*
All this Oscar Piastri saga overshadowed the fact that Mclaren never had a fast/reliable car to begin with.
Fun season ahead! How wonderful it would be to see Fernando Alonso battling with the top 3 teams if the car is as promising as it looks.
ALO!!! 🥹
You can already see McLaren is heading for a repeat of the start of last season. How much longer can they keep this up? It’s McLaren ffs, what on earth is going wrong?
Lewis no more a star driver. Russell is the star driver now
McLaren should be thrown off the grid for being a disgrace to racing. For what’s been spent, total embarrassment.
Perez, Hamiltom, Bottas,, seems familiar
That alpha has such a nice livery
red bull's cooking sumth
That music is horribly distracting and worse than McLaren's reliability
Maybe it's just the 1 time but merc doesn't look fast an the straights even with drs
It’s exciting to see some teams preparing to take a step forward up the grid. Next Friday can’t get here sooner!❤
I would like to pay tribute to all the teams. Thanks to FORMURA 1.
Dit seizoen word leeeeeeeipp Alonso gaat verassen
no porposing this year?
Wow bottas 3rd, Wishing its real pace for alfa
*Black Arrows*
More wheel to wheel this time
Team Drugovich yeah!!!
These cars go from models to supermodels once the floodlights fire up! Wish the W14 had a glossier body.
IT'S LIGHTS OUT AND AWAY WE GO ...in 1 week.
@FORMULA 1 Pretty cool video.
If you're wondering The lower ambient temperature of the evening run makes for faster lap times and thebcars tires grip better and Leclerc was still quicker in morning than Carlos Sainz in the evening.
Mclaren is very worrying though
Go Drugovich!
just to think redbull is probably sandbagging 😬
The curse of Danny RIC! Haha
Alpha have actually looked really promising. Same with Williams. Going to be great to have more than the big 4 teams competing this year
No creo que AM llegue al podio esta 1er carrera... El Nano llega 4to o 5to sería genial. El compañero debería ser Drugovich... Vettel sería negativo ... A pesar de ser una leyenda
Ocon struggling with the balance of the car hahaha, he can't copy Alonso's setup now.
Vamos Checo con todo.. Excelente gran inicio 🙌🏼
Merc was on super softs so the tine was not apples for apples.
How are people making all of these assumptions from testing though 🥴
Hamilton star driver 😂😂 defo passed its prime, if it be a dog then you’d take out back and shoot it 😅
Hard to imagine red bull not just dominating
Why do you refer to Perez as “napping”? That is racist! When will F1 give up the colonialist behavior?
Nice Checo.....we belive in U!!!! Show the entire world what MEXICAN POWER means!!!
On my birthday too :)
These cars do look faster and the Mercedes still looks like it has porpoising issue
Ferrari is clearly sandbagging, given that Leclercs pole time last year was 1:30.5, i still have faith that they're gonna be quick
Anyone else excited to see Aston challenge the top 3?
This will be a great year as  these cars look  to be  fast.realky  fast
‘Blasting past’  Proceeds to overtake in the breaking zone
The Alpha and Merc liveries look amazing on track
I want to like Oscar as an aussie but I hate how he took the spot of Daniel....so torn
Merc are hiding something. I don't trust them until Q3. I learned from 2019 and I'll never do that mistake again
Give Drugo a chance
Give Drugovich Stroll's car imho
Where is the arrow car give him that
Go CHECO. 💥🇩🇴
Imagine Stroll can’t race next week and they bring back Vettel for a weekend. Vettel and Alonso on the same team!!
What do you think about Aston??
Comments in regard to Checo: " the fastest of all three practice sessions" followed by "caught him sleeping."
1 more week ladies and gentlemen, 1 more week!
Can't wait for another controversial season, last lap sprint, cost cap - let's see what redbull gets away with this season.
Checo Champ🏆👍🏼😎
Ferrari stinks
Typical Ferrari, they get our hopes up, make baby steps forward, then they go 20 steps backwards, and, slower than a granny gopher...
i know this is irrelevant but i just had a juicy orange
There is some sandbagging. Ferraris are not that far off.
Ferrari, Charles had a amazing lap time have very high hopes for him, may this be the year of Ferrari
Mercedes wins the championship this year=Like  Redbull wins the championship this year=comment Ferrari wins the championship this year=Subscribe
Nice one Checo!!! All the best from Canada. 👍
Hear me out, Alonso p3 in the championship
imagine if it was alonso and vettel in the AM team...
Red Bull were sandbagging. They're miles ahead of everyone else.
"star" driver... LOL🤣 probably fading star. Should've retired while ahead.
esteban ocon playing f1 with a keyboard bruh
Felipe Drugovich was fantastic. He deserves to drive in the first stage of F1 2023. 🐲🐲🐲
The non so subtle negative bias towards PER from the commentator is bordering hilarious.
What caused alot of lock up to the cars?
The McLaren looks like a dog this year. It's possible they've gone backwards from 2022!
Yeah. Drugovich is fast in these 2023 spec cars 🤦
I cut sound and focused on the aesthetics of these drives. Must say Ferrari and especially Mercedes look very wobbly. Alpine are a disaster, from this perspective, and Aston Martin flatter to deceive, I'm afraid
Max on vacation with his feet up 😂
I hope Alfa is strong this year
F1 sound is so lame and boring..how can ppl still watch it and see it as interesting? I miss those old days when F1 made noise.. bring back those old motors!
After last season, I hope Checo takes the gloves off and goes for it. No more Mr. Nice guy, it's time to f¥€k the prom queen.
Alfa Romeo beautiful colour
Vamos Checo! 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Sainz was 12 thousands not 12 hundreds behind Leclerc
Lando messed up by signing such a long contract with McLaren. Had better chances of a win as a second driver in Red Bull.
1:40 - 1:45 never noticed how nice the Ferrari looked 👀
Cheers from the Pacific West Coast of Canada.
McLaren 😭
I would love to see that Aston fight for podiums, such a pretty car, & such a scrappy team, they deserve it
33!
Aston really is shining for real this time it seems, fingercross man!
🇮🇳🇮🇳🙏🙏👍👍
The mercedes cars should be referred to as "The Carbon Arrows"
Checo Perez on top if somebody has any doubts
YOU GO CHECO !!
Another boring year, like 2022. 💩
There are no highlights, as the whole thing is a stunt for the media
I am worried about Mclaren.
Leclerc and Sainz are always almost at the same performance.
Go Hamilton!!!
Does anyone else feel like the grid was missing someone? A four time champion from Germany.
Who replaced James Vowles' in the Merc? I thought i saw him still in the Merc pitwall👀
Someone needs to teach Will Buxton the difference between 'least' and 'fewest'.
"Blasting past the ferrari of Charles leclerc"  Meanwhile barely gaining any distance
4:00 jeez handling like a indycar car
Hammer Time 🤣😂🤣
Haha louis
piastri gonna be a bust
let's go racing 🏎️
I do wonder if some teams were on orders to not push too hard and save going full out for next week.
Wow, did Fernando know things we don't about Aston Martin this year? 😏😏
I hope Ferrari is sandbagging...
drugo is  impresive in that amr23 and with someone like nando to guide him!!
Fastest Lap: Checo Pérez
So, if F1 cars are so fast, why do they look so slow?
McLaren challenging for last spot 🤦‍♂
Filipe wearing glasses that would suit Perceval Derollo
Ferrari back to 3rd this year
Hulkenburg : “leave me alone I know what I’m doing”
2021: Mazespin 2023: Spinastri. 😁👍
I feel like Mercedes needs to be referred to as "Black Arrows" until they actually paint the car again.
Breaking News! Tesla will start the 2025 F1 season.
上位のタイムを出しているのに相変わらず角田の映像無いな。公式としてどう思ってるんだ？Where is Tsunoda ?? Show us !!😤
Perez for WDC? 👀
how amazing would it be if aston keeps this up and we get a 4 way title battle soon
Drugovich will bring joy for us Brazilians once again! You got it, bro! VAMOSSSS 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Huge Congratulations to McLaren!!!
With relegation this sport can be lit
As usual max in front 🎉
Going to binge drive to survive season 5!!
Please just give us a crazy season
mclaren falling apart already. yikes!
nice report, only music is so annoying
Piastri selling himself as a big time driver and no results on the track 🤡
3:18 are we actually gonna call these things over the front wheels ‘wheel-brows’? I’m all for it😂😂😂
How did the best driver ever do 44
just throw lance out and put in Drugovich
Get in there Lewis!!
It looks like another domineering year for RB from start to finish which means Max champion again. Hopefully it won't come to that. Last season was somewhat disappointing.
RB n Max to win it,with 7 races to go. I'd love that.
So ready for the season
🏁GO MAX!🏁
the loss of the 2021 hydrualic coolers makes a huge difference in the braking, even the anti lock brake sensors wiring are being melted by the combined external tire and brake heat. also seems the transmission coolers were part of the under carriage wings that were removed for 2022 with all the DNFs and gear box failures as drivers got too comfortable with these luxury coolers
Silver Arrows😂😂😂🤡
I hope the atmosphere in the Aston camp isn´t too great. Some setbacks could really prove sour then. But we´ll see, at least podium contention would already be amazing for the season.
cars didn't change much from waht i can see.
Still out drugo in 🤞
Well Crofty,  When anyone talks about what a driver can do with a non-competitive car as a benchmark, don't overlook the fact that he was up against a Mercedes, along with other champions, that was considered to have an exceptional advantage over the field; and thus dominate wins. Far more than Max had last year, yet Max achieved a massive season record. And when Max had an improved car in 2021, he was able to beat car and driver(not in the Constructors, but as a pair). Even as said car and driver were beaten in 2022 by RBR, and by his own team mate as well, in the same car...Bias can be quite blinding, and heartfelt.
redbull is fastest we can all skip the season
The sound difference between driver reaction video and this video is too much , when I switch this video from that one it hurt my ears, just letting you know f1 admin :) Edit:Actually it is not that bad but intro is too loud in this vid imo.
2:53 Yo when did Matt Murdock join Aston Martin?
ova vremena neznače baš puno,razlićite postavke,različite gume,razlićita količina goriva .......jesu neke naznake al .......
McLaren is like 2017 and 2018 again
Ok im suggesting Oscar Spin mastery
Alonso is an organization, he he has phd on upgrading
Has oscar been that far from lando in other sessions? I haven't been following pre season close at all.
DO NOT refer to the Mercedes as Silver Arrow as the vehicles livery is BLACK. Seems like Toto Wolf is kissing Hamiltons backside once again.
Beware of the Mercs. They are going to be strong.
Let's go CHECOOOOOOOO
What’s going on with Alfa’s gearboxes ?
Can’t wait for next weekend!
background music is annoying, those cheap free song
So they are not yet pushing the cars, and they already are faster than last year
I hope Alonso can reach a podium place this year.
Well RB is by far the best car, best time with a C4 that was 0.359s faster then Mercedes on C5. Yes it's testing, but they had 3 days without any problems and looked on rails. I don't think any of these teams were sandbagging on the last day since everyone would want to understand how the car behaves on fast laps. Nowadays with so few days of testing you can't wait for the first race to collect that data.
CHECO CHECO CHECO
That Ferrari engine is something. Checo wasn't closing the gap that quickly with DRS at 0:36. I expect a RB vs Ferrari battle for first half of the season, with Merc strong in a few circuits. Then Merc becomes competitive later in the season. Next season is probably where we get a proper 3 team battle at every circuit.
Se van a ver varios 1-2de red Bull awebo checo... tampoco digo que checo siempre será 1 para los antichecos
Perez He Is An Absolute Donkey!
I hope we can see Drugo racing for AM next week!
I'm ready for some racing
Well Mclaren fans, we still have each other.. and Lando.
The Alpine is so bad 😂😂
We won't know anything till the end of qualifying, great to see the cars though !
Have better music
Aston has an opportunity to get rid of Lance right now and they absolutely should.
Alfa is hilarious 😂
so ready for some actual racing to get underway.
Lewis, give us one more World Title this year mate. We all know you can do it! 😊
Not too long ago, McLaren had claimed that it was the Honda PU that was holding them back and they had the best chassis. Wonder who they're gonna blame now.
Argh! Redbull dominance is in full swing... again
Merlin loves RED- BULL MAGIC  FROM  A.N. HAHA 👍
last year was max's year, this year is checo's year!
It's going to be a great season!!!! I think the mid-field title will be playing musical chairs!
Drugoooo 🇧🇷
This season is gonna be crazy, i cant wait
Alonso tri campeon f1 2023!!!!
Journalistic liberties there that only mislead
Lewis must not ever change his helmet this season. 2:15 all together just looks stunning
how possible you all think it is that Alfa is faster than Ferrari???🤣😅🤣😅 come on be serious...this is just testing..we DONT KNOW ANYTHINK yet about true pace....
Bros, hear me out. This is is not the year of Merc, Red Bull or Ferrari. This is the year of Aston Martin. But for real. It'd be a great season if Alonso wins the championship.
Funny last year the alfa stopped in exact the same spot with a gearbox isseu as well in testing
Oxons alpine seemed freekishly nervous. Got scared only by watching.
Alonso WDC
And Haas?
Silver arrows should rename to "carbon arrows"
Computer controlled cars yes its scaletrics
Might as well give rb the title now
Drugovich is better than Stroll...I mean who isn't ? 🤔
Come on Hamilton's this is it your chance
Red Bull catering serving up aerodynamic sensors for lunch today.
Red Bull look insanely quick... Perez his Fastest lap was done with a top speed of 318 kph.. on day 2 i believe the red bulls hit 326 kph
This is the last year of Hami in Mercedes
Alfa Romeo looks beautiful
It’s all part of the show. No one showed their hand.
KING BUXTON GETS ME PUMPED FOR THE SEASON BRO!!!!
I know sandbagging is a common practice these days but it seems like red bull will have the edge this season.
1:12 that didnt really look like blasting past the ferrari
Sheeesh the w14 looks much better in tests than the w13 by miles can't w8 for the development during the seasson 😍
I'm simple. Push Max of the throne, and cheer for young pair of McLaren.
That alfa romeo looks nice, but as someone who got into F1 last year( dont care about DTS) lets go alonso!
Oscar Spinastri
Can't wait to see Gasly and Ocon Duke it out this year. Gasly is clearly the faster driver.
Aston Martin F1 team is the Most Serious Team ever.
Although I know it would never have happened, but I think it would have been interesting to see how Danny Ric would have faired back in the RB.  To perhaps finally put to bed whether he really has lost all that speed or it was just down to his driving style not suiting the cars under him.  Overall it seems there will be a little bit of shake up in the mid to lower tiers, but the top 3 are the top 3 for a reason.  I genuinely hope that all 3 teams are fighting for the championship in October/November to keep us ALL interested.
I hope Aston Martin becomes a serious contender, and both Williams & Haas become serious points contenders.
Why Mclaren car looks cheap.
I can’t wait!
Valterri's helmet is so funny 😂
MAx Max Max he is the Best
Bravo Checo and Red Bull Racing! If Checo Perez is already faster than Lewis with the harder tires, then that shows how strong the RB19 is! Top performance by Max in the last two days!💪🏻💪🏻🧡🦁🧡🏁🍾🍾🍾
Vamos Fernando!
Aston Martin needs to get rid of Stroll and let Drugovich drive
Go Checo go!
as a die hard ferrari fan i rly miss our rivals mclaren in the top :(.
A tons of comments here will age like milk, mark my words
Lewis vs Max prt 2 thw story continues
What I see is Alfa Romeo will fight for the second place
Can’t wait to see Stroll fire Stroll
The Ferrari looks sick! ❤
If Alonso has a half decent car .......watch out
You don't understand how excited I'm getting at the mere idea of Alonso having a competitive and reliable car this year.  El Plan is coming along nicely
8 million subscribers and this is the recording quality?
Don’t do that Aston Martin… don’t give me hope :/
I have a question after hearing a comment if you were and F1 driver and you beat your team mate last season would you be upset if you were still referred as the 2nd driver?
Why some cars had these green/orange marks on them?
Alonso number1/team boss.  Aboslute legend he deserves another WDC
It will be Red Bull against Ferrari again for the podium places.
Lol McLaren can EAD
Let’s just hope for a toxic free and competitive year
Mclaren bruh...so many sponsors but can't develop at least a p4 car. How long is Lando's contract cos I don't see him staying any longer.
The 🐐 is in the hunt. 2023 let's eat.
This is going be wild 🔥
So the teams that aint showing nothing new, mclaren, alpine, and sauber will be exactly where there expected.
Always watching from Georgetown Guyana south America 🇬🇾🇬🇾🇬🇾
Mario Andretti said " There are no fast cars only fast drivers"
Last year's best time was Max with 1:31.720
Mclaren put more Google Chrome logos. The problems worsened.
I only wish a Alonso's podio🙏🏻
Hoping for Ferrari/Merc or AM, unfortunately McLaren won’t be competitive. Anything to see RB, the most toxic team, down the grid. One can dream.
Boring 2004-like season incoming with Verschumacher and Barricheco at the top
Drugovich> Stroll
I always thought Sergio was there just to be there but my respect to the Mexicans, they really do have somebody in F1, crazy how Red Bull saw it
Sad McLaren noises :(
Valtteri putting in P3 in the last hour after repairs! i would really love to see him win another race.  i didint know McLaren's garage is in Woking. I think there is a Pizza Planet there.
Someone please give Drugovich a better sunglass!!!
The Stake advertising allover the Alfa is so wonderful. However, the moral compass has been defective for a long time, so no one is surprised.
The world of Formula 1 was never the same after the major technical regulation overhaul. The season that followed was one of the most intense and dramatic in history. Two drivers, Charles LeClerc and Max Verstappen, were poised for a battle for the championship title. But little did they know that a third contender, George Russell, would emerge and shake up the entire season.  The media was buzzing with excitement, and conspiracy theories were rampant. Some even claimed that the technical regulations were altered to favor certain teams and drivers. Alex Jones, the infamous conspiracy theorist, was quick to jump on board.  "The globalists are trying to rig the Formula 1 season!" he shouted into his microphone. "LeClerc and Verstappen are being given special treatment, while other drivers like George Russell are being held back. It's a conspiracy, folks!"  The season started with LeClerc and Verstappen battling it out for the top spot. But Russell, a young and relatively unknown driver, suddenly started winning races. Jones seized on this as evidence of his conspiracy theory.  "They can't let a nobody like Russell win!" he ranted. "They're trying to throw off the balance of power and rig the championship. It's all part of their plan!"  As the season progressed, the tension between the drivers was palpable. LeClerc and Verstappen were determined to hold onto their lead, while Russell was quickly gaining ground. The races were filled with heart-stopping moments, as the drivers pushed themselves and their cars to the limit.  Jones continued to rant and rave, insisting that the globalists were behind every twist and turn of the season. But even he couldn't deny the excitement of the championship battle.  In the end, it all came down to the final race of the season. LeClerc was leading the championship, with Verstappen and Russell close behind. The tension was thick in the air, as the drivers revved their engines and prepared to take the track.  The race was a blur of speed and adrenaline, as the drivers fought for every inch of track. LeClerc and Verstappen battled it out for the lead, with Russell nipping at their heels.  And then, in a stunning turn of events, Russell surged ahead and crossed the finish line first. The crowd erupted in cheers, as the young driver celebrated his victory. LeClerc and Verstappen were left in shock and disbelief, as they realized they had been beaten.  Jones, true to form, claimed that the globalists had orchestrated the entire thing. But even he couldn't deny the sheer excitement of the season.  "Love it or hate it, folks," he said into his microphone, "Formula 1 just got a whole lot more interesting."
Carbon arrows not silver
If McLaren aren't even 4th anymore I already cba with this season...
These cars still look ridiculously stiff and silly under new regs. Huge, heavy, no suspension movement, drivers and cars bouncing up and down.
PLEASE TELL ME IS HAMMER TIME
I hope everyone sees 👀 that Red bull is really on fire 🔥.  They have a powerful and fast cars and great drivers
Red Bull, Mercedes, Ferrari, Aston Martin, Alfa Romeo Williams, Toro Rosso, Mclaren, Haas, Alpine. In this order. My prediction. What are your thoughts?
Aston Martin and Alfa will be pushing the top three this season for sure :)
It seems incredible, to me, that F1 teams which spend millions on preparing their cars for a very long season are only permitted 3 days of testing. That's like restricting a world-class boxing champion to a week of training before a championship bout. Why do the teams stand for such restrictions?
Drugovich doing his thing 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Aston and Alonsooooooooooooooooooooou
No Williams today?
hammer time? I don't think so
Mercedes have began offloading yesterday's sandbags, impressive.
Teams not showing their true form😂
It's Maxs to lose
Here for the speculation!!
Looking promissing! Can't wait for next weekend!
Mazespin would've still spun in day 3, just days 1 and 2 as well
RB trying to make Mercedes reveal themselves 😁  At the end they got the smell… which was also due to the Mercedes fans
Wondering why De Vries was so slow today.
Bottas has got the best Helmet of anyone else's on the grid 😂😂😂
There is literally an accent over the first e in 'pÉrez', signifying that it is emphasised. Why is he still pronouncing it 'prrez'?
Why does this report have to have an annoying drum kit and chords beating along in the background? Absolutely unnecessary. Or are you just catering for the Mario Cart® generation.....?
rooting for Drugovic get a chance in bahrein
I don't think we can call the Mercedes "Silver Arrow" if it's black.
Being a McLaren fan isn't easy
Come on Checo bring the heat towards Max, keep him on his toes this year!!! 👊🏼
hyped for the season, but as a mclaren fan maybe not as much 😢😂
They give him the chance, and Perez tops the charts!
Is merc sandbagging again or are they not ?
Anyone else watching classic 90's F1 clips?
7u7
CHECOOOOOOO
Kinda depressed as a McLaren fan but we'll see.
😍👍 F1 IS COMING
Cant wait for next week
The rookies -- including the stand-in rookie! -- are all looking quite solid. It's only practice, I know, but...
We pray for a competitive season for the championship. Ferrari needs to be closer this year cuz I have doubts in Mercedes
"Those sensors can be expensive" 👍
THis is just testing, lets see what happens in Australia, and we will know who is on the top.
The best lap time in this test session had already beaten Bahrain pole last season. Assuming the teams have yet to run on their fastest engine mode, then this season's cars are going to be blistering fast
Final day
McLaren on the backfoot yet again, another disappointing season ahead.
Ocon looks like he was driving an Indycar💀😂
Drive to survive fans are almost as bad as Hamiltons (aka the great pretender) cult.
Alfa already having gear box problems…. Poor Bottas it’s gonna be another long season.
Hyped for this season
2:00 Lewis reminsicing his 2021 race line
Oh, HAM BOT, how I've missed you
3 days of testing is ridiculous
Mi prima y yo vimos la F1. Cuando eramos niños jugabamos a la F1.
I hear an 8th inbound
Perez is 0,2 sec faster than Ferrari pole last year,F1 is become a joke,and here is why,and now consider Red Bull's story that the penalty they received for violating the Budget Cap 2021(145 mill) will be reflected on the car in 2023(135 mill), do you see that they are lagging behind or have made even more progress, I am sure that they also violated the Budget Cap 2022(140 mill), if it is proven, Red Bull should be disqualified for 2022 and suspended for 2023-2024
Hamilton win championships
Stop being so ageist about Fernando. He's shown he has more than enough pace. Drop the "old dog" schtick!
Vamoooos Fernando!!!
Alonso 🔥🔥🔥
This can really be a very competitive season!
2:02 Lewis going for the outer loop layout
So breaching/cheating does help and should be done with these minor slap on the wrist penalties
tomas crucero is doing well
Hammer time ❤
Lewis did awesomely well. Keep it up lewis 🔥🔥🔥💜💜💜
Let's gooo Checo!
Redbull: 18 wins in 2023
Alonso hype again.  If he leaves next year for Haas, people will be saying how this is the year he's going to be world champion.
Like if semi
Limits... During thr race? 😆
George did not blast past the Ferrari
Am I the only person who really loves the livery on the HAAS this year 😍😍😍.
AloNOTslo
RB, Ferrari, Merc, and Aston all with realistic podium chances. This is going to be an outstanding season.
Yesssss a week until the first race
Perez got first?! That's insane! 😱
The shot and the sound at 1:45 real sublime, nice to have F1 back.
"uh, Lance...take your time healing mate..."
Man im so annoyed Seb never got drive a decent aston martin
1 WEEK TO GO Never been so hyped for an f1 season & if pre season is anything to go by it could be an interesting one with a few surprises along the way
Been rooting for Checo since the start and still rooting for him.
gg red bull and verstappen
el plan is coming. Beware
People... go look at 2022 testing times. I think first 3 teams will AGAIN be within 0,5 seconds.
Next week we'll see how the cards are shuffled.
My competitive order estimation for the season-opener: RBR Ferrari Mercedes AM (at least with Alonso, so teammate be that Stroll or Drugovich might mix towards the tail-end) Alpine AR Mclaren AT/Haas Haas/AT Williams  Mclaren could also be even lower, but for now, I'm positive they won't be as much down the field as in the last Bahrain GP, while Haas & AT are the hardest for assessment.
Early title contender - max  Surprise package - Aston Martin  Team to be worried about - mclaren  Best rookie - Logan
Sounds like El Plan has become Estep by Estep.
RedBull - The fastest. Ferrari - Could be fighting for P1.  Mercedes - Sandbagging as usual.
Yes ,I am . 217864
2:09 you had to do it didn't you 😆
Ford f 150
1 week left. Can't wait😁😁
Crazy to wake up to this just being uploaded
