We are nothing without kane. Boring! Ange tried his best to make us fun but we are now boring. Btw ndombele scored the most powerful side foot shot ever
Here after the 6-1 win (23/04/2023). How the tables have turned.
AS A LFC SUPPORTER I JUST WANTED TO ECHO THE SAME WORDS I WAS SAYING TO MY FRIEND THAT YES SPURS HAVE KANE AND SON HOWEVER I RECKON IF WE PLAY A  LITTLE MORE DANGEROUSLY WITH THE REST OF THE BOYS WE SHOULD EASILY WIN OVER SPURS AGAINST OUR UP AND COMING GAME.
as of now, the fan who had the cardiac arrest has been discharged from hospital. also clear 2nd yellow. shelvey cant complain.
Best wishes to that fan who had the heart attack, hope he pulls through
Ndombele 1-1  0:34 Kane 2-1  0:56 Son 3-1  1:55
Here's to that unfortunate fans' speedy recovery. But this whole game simply sums up Newcastle in a nutshell.  The new owners must be looking at each other and saying: ''Ok, we'll need to sell off another 5 oil tankers for this project''.
Best wishes to that Newcastle fan
Newcastle will definitely rip it up in the championship 😂
All the best Steve, you don't deserve the crap you've had from the club or some of the fans.  Very few clubs have invested less over the last couple of seasons.
All the best to the new castle fan
Best wishes go out to the fan and his family
Hats off to all the people who got involved for the quick reactions, here's hoping the fan makes a speedy recovery.
Respect to the ref for stopping the match all praises 👏 to him
That fan that collapsed had a tenner on a  Newcastle win!  The stress got to him.
I think that was the best thing that could happen at St James's. The new owners seen first hand the excitement and noise generated by the best support in the league, quickly followed by the  silence and disappointment that Bruce's tactics bring. They know they can bring the good times back, but much work to do.
Jonjo Shelvey’s job interview went well
Great fast reaction from regullion  No other player noticed the fan having cardiac arrest If it were not for him the fan may have been dead long gone Props to dier also for getting the medics to run up to the fan  Best wishes to the fan ♥️  Glad Kane got the goal COYS
Commentators are soo dead
dier got own goal and man of the match, what a legend
Man of the match and defender of the century Eric Dyer ladies and gents😂😂🤣🤣
what kind of FIFA commentary is this
So glad the fan is in stable condition.. well done to the spurs players.. they reacted very quickly 👏👏👏
Fan probably had vaccine
Martin Tyler shows his favoured team every game without shame. Come on Sky... surely you can do better?
0:29 anyone else notice Ant and Dec in the crowd?
Martin Tyler is needed out of the game absolute party killer that bloke
Pierre Emile Hojbjerg has no vision !! Kane was in acres of space on right and whats he do?  Pass it to Son on left with people marking him.   These guys get paid Multiple Thousands of pounds a week and cant even see a simple pass !!
Let Eric Dier be a centre back they said, wouldn't be bad for the team they said. P.s wishes to the Newcastle fan and get well soon
Of course he scores, he is auditioning for Newcastle United.....
Why does Tyler have an agenda against Spurs
Hope he is ok god bless I hope he gets a speedy recovery ❤❤❤
Can we just talk about how satisfying reguilons touch was
Only dier could save a fans life and still score an own goal
I swear from that angle he still looks offside.
State of the fella bowing down in front of the new owners
Big respect to Reguilón and Dier for their humanity Thoughts and prayers go to the Newcastle fan, wishing him a vast recovery
Not a bad start for Newcastles new owners lol.
Soon Newcastle will be toying with these man! 😂
1:13 THAT IS OFFSIDE
0:52 The lady on the right cluelessly celebrating the opposition's goal XDD
Players get slated for the wages they earm ( jealousy) but respect must be given to both Newcastle and Tottenham Players quick reaction in noticing that a supporter in the stand needed urgent medical attention
“Newcastle are the best team in the world”
Hopefully Newcastle get relegated
I thought the last goal was another Tottenham score 😂😂
Martin Tyler saying "fairytale" after newcastle were just bought by a country says all you need to know about Sky and modern football.
2:52 What a finish! Keeper had no chance
How’s Eric dier a premier league player
Good football boy
I got scared when Newcastle scored 😱😱😱😱
Martin Tyler on Wilson's goal: 0:10 Martin Tyler on Ndombele's goal: 0:38 Difference???????? 🧐🧐🧐
Notice the difference in Tyler's reactions when each team scores, genuine joy when Newcastle do and sounds like he's gonna cry when Spurs do.
How did the commentator go crazy for Wilson's goal but Ndombele scores a great goal and it's like Meh?
Sky salivating over everything Newcastle. The city, Ant and Dec, the owners, fans, borough, the county. Bloody everything. They forgot, that they should have been salivation over the Spurs display. Sorry forgot, sky don't do that to Spurs. They can't help themselves.
Walk in the park COYS
Newcastle need to realise the game doesn't last two minutes. They never got a look in afterwards.
Sky do not like Spurs they turn the microphone down our stadium Liverpool Mafia and Man Utd
Anyone else notice ant and dec n the stand
Martin Tyler is so hyped when United score 1 goal when 3-0 down but does nothing if the opposition scores a goal
A trophy less club beat the worlds richest club
Not a fan of either team but respect to the players doctors and referee for instant response for that fan👏👏
pov you can see ant and dec
If Newcastle go down ,almost guaranteed to come straight back up anyways
Harry Kane the 🐪
The most expensive club to grace the championship
Newcastle have got to stay up first 😂
Not only did Dier give the needless free kick away(88th min), he then decided to plant it past Loris! The guy is a liability and has been for sometime!
0:51 - The one fan celebrating amongst the Newcastle fans is too funny!
BREAKING NEWS: STEVE BRUCE SUMMONED TO THE TURKISH EMBASSY (SUITCASE AWAITING HIM) 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Dier realized he was playing Newcastle, so decide to do a Phil Jones. agreed!
Dier got joint motm for helping the fam and he scored an own goal
Amit bhattia sitting with owners, maybe some players out going qpr..
Dier wants in at Newcastle
So glad they could get to the fan quick enough to act and get him the medical attention he needed.
If you don't enjoy watching N'dombele play then you don't understand football.
The new owners pretending to be big Toon fans. Aye right!
Newcastle hire Keegan.... CHAIRMAN: Who would you like to sign first.... KEEGAN: Are Shearer, Ferdinand, Asprilla, Beardsley & Ginola available.... CHAIRMAN: I'm afraid they all retired a while ago.... KEEGAN: Where am I & how did I get here....
COYS
If they decide to get get rid of Bruce don't hire Keegan because even third times the charm doesn't work in this situation 😂
Newcastle only lost because they not bought anyone yet....
Eric Dier tragic again, can't understand how he starts CB regularly
Eric dier and maguire the joke of the English defence
Shelvey should stick to hunting down Harry Potter
Newcastle should buy kane he's the one to us out of the Championship
Glad the fan is OK.  More to the point, how is Martin Tyler? Sounds depressed.
GG Spurs, You are a brilliant team 👏
Best wishes ⭐️ to that fan that had a heart attack ❤️‍🩹hope they make a speedy recovery 🙏
Didn't expect Newcastle to win this game but figured that they would actually try since there fighting to not get their contracts ripped up what a shambles zero heart or passion least the new owners know that the club needs a new defence, midfield and a winger all the rest should be sacked along with Bruce
0:29 hello Ant & Dec.
I don’t know what Eric Dier has on Daniel Levy to make sure he starts.
Get well soon to that newcastle fan
how come that Kane goal was not classed as coming back from an offside position?, he was onside for 2 seconds at the most, cheating as usual.
Shelvy is so dead
Newcastle deserve to be top though
Something doesn't seem right about this TO at NU....
I hope the Newcastle fan makes a speedy recovery ❤
Are the fans still blaming Mike Cashley? The team were good for 3 minutes Amanda should get to sports direct with her receipt and ask for her money back for faulty goods
See ufea thats how you handle if someone collapses at a game, hope the fan is ok
🙏🙏🙏🙏
Bring back Ashley
Does nobody find it a bit unsettling Son celebrating after everything that had just happened?
I’ve seen Harry Kane get some ridiculous penalty’s but know there even ignoring blatant offsides🤦🏽‍♂️ original decision was offside so how was that overturned???
The disappointment in Tyler’s voice when ndombele scores is so clear. Sky so wanted a Newcastle win yesterday it was actually quite nauseating. If in doubt listen to the tone when spurs score compared to Newcastle. Embarrassing
Reguilon, MOTM for what he did. Speedy recovery to the Newcastle fan.
Newcastle the richest club in The Championship
Martin Tyler hates Spurs
0:19 ant n dec in the corner
Here’s a thought ; the most expensive team in the championship?
bruce out
Owners reaction following first goal suggest they have a lot to learn about football :)
Roses are red violent are blue tottenham is great so are you
Kane really wants that oil money
Best wishes for the fan who was seriously ill speedy recovery 🙏Millwall season ticket holder 👏
Why are people feeling sorry for Steve Bruce? They'll pay him millions, he's at the age that most people are thinking of retiring anyway and if he wants to carry on, they'll be jobs for him (admittedly probably not in the Premier League, but still). I mean, it's not a disaster, is it?
Pep would struggle to win a game with that Newcastle squad. Best of luck in the future brucey hopefully get a team where you can have a say in what players come in
Kane’s goal was offside
Respect to reguilon for spotting it
Get rid of the linesman for god sake they are too slow their just hanging onto the game
Hope Newcastle Fan is OK.  Get well soon.  To the Game Spurs should have wiped the floor..  This is what the problem is with this team.  Credit Newcastle on the start.  Credit the spurs goalscorers.  Spurs need to do much much better than that.  Newcastle are going to need to buy well and also to keep some of their good inform players. Big ask for them to stay up.  I think they should keep Bruce, but I do think his last game, win or lose is at Palace.
westham vs everton highlights is missing
1:08 Curb your Enthusiasm..1:22
☢️ GUYS! WE JUST GOT NEWS THAT THE FAN IS DOING ABSOLUTELY FINE AND IS CHILLING AT HOSPITAL🙂 ☢️
Spurs score a brilliant goal for the equaliser and Tyler wants to kill himself, he doesn’t half make it obvious when he doesn’t like a team
Eric just wants to sell himself to the new Newcastle owners "Look I'm already scoring for you!".  xD
Reguilon and Dier proving themselves to be class acts. Hope the Newcastle fan is ok
Oh look Harry kane showed up today. More like I am here, sign me Newcastle call!!!
Could Tyler be any more biased?
Where’s the West Ham goals???
Wtf? The amount of time ive seen st maximun sprinting back to help the defence. What a guy 👏🏻
Any other takers 💉
How Eric dier is still playing for that club is beyond me
I don't know why ppl worried about kane, every season he gets going in october
Newcastle need to realise that success won't happen over night but will start to happen in the January transfer window 🤣🤣
Pundits going on about how Kane's forms was based on the failed Man City bid. Look at Kane's record at the start of previous seasons. It takes him a good few games to get going. Even after injury. He will go on a run of goals now.
Dier is always doing some kind of clownery.
All the best to the Newcastle fan
I knew Tottenham would win when they put Ndombele in an attacking role.
That’s amazing roar from the toon would even louder we new it wouldn’t be change straight away if you did ya not really a true fan haha Mike Ashley might be gone but he’s left us a championship side bar afew but roar sounded class love it and thoughts go out to the fan who fainted or had heart attack hope you get well ASAP 🙏⚫️⚪️⚫️⚪️ ps howa first win will come just keep supporting and being rowdy and loud :)
The Tottenham kit is a thing of beauty
Newcastle to get relegated😂
Shame Newcastle couldn't get the 3 points today to keep the momentum of their joy of being took over going. Back down to earth with a big thud I suppose. On a positive note though its great news to hear that the fan who had a heart attack is alive and recovering well.
John jo shelveys last game for Newcastle?
I hope that fan is doing well. I can't say I've seen that in football before.
2024 Tottenham 1 Newcastle 7 remember I said this
Dier n Shelvey are useless
Wow Martin Tyler didn't sound half disappointed when that Ndombele goal went in
Noooor man, Noooor! We still haven't won a game yet, how frustrating man! I'm desperate for a win! 🙈
Spurs literally breaking the hearts of Newcastle fans
Anyone else feel like vomitting after seeing Spurs kit?
Harry kane to Newcastle in January then...
My granny could a scored that mr lisp aka Harry Kane is 💩 over rated
Commentator sounds so upset when spurs score. Completely the opposite tone on each of toon's goals.
The new Newcastle united regime. What do they call that a freudian slip or something.
Anyone see ant and dec
That woman at Newcastle is already getting annoying
ndombele scores a beauty, fan collapses in the stadium (wishing him a speedy recovery), Shelvey sent off, and a thrilling 3-2 game   Sky sports video title: hARry kAnE sCorEs 😍😍😍
Martin Tyler doesn't seem to be able to actually commentate on the actual game, like describe the atmosphere,pitch,players and the way it's been played from a neutral view. He needs a lesson from our very own Mícheál Ó Muircheartaigh. Pure legend at  describing/commentating.
He aint a hero u messin
Why does this game always feel like a london derby but it isn’t.
We need to stop this, celebrating after 1-0 like they've won the world Cup final its getting ridiculous from all clubs.
0:18 ant and dec in bottom left  Also hope fan is ok that had cardiac arrest
Really feel sad to see a top club fighting for relegation because of some greedy owners who played with emotions of people.   Hopefully they will not be relegated and the new owners will make some sensible decisions to take the club forward.   Best wishes to TOON ARMY ⟬⟭💜
where is everton vs west ham highlights
Always dier that scores own goals
Big big game today 💪
Crazy to think Steve Bruce will get £8M when he gets sacked
Let's hope Jan brings a new back line for Newcastle because they were absolutely disgusting today. They need to start showing up soon or they will be out the door
Easiest bet I ever won. Newcastle were not allowed to prepare properly and why would the players and manager try their hardest? They’re all going to be replaced. Unless the owners offer each one fo then a million per win, the club is going to get relegated.
Best of wishes to the Newcastle fan wishing him a speedy recovery 🙏🏻
Spurs fully deserved the win they were a different class above Newcastle bruce need to walk he is terrible he’s not good enough to be a premiership manager he shouldn’t even be in the championship either
I believe Eric dier called for the defibrillator so a big round of applause for Mr Dier good job sir..
0:28 you can see ant and dec in the crowd
Say what you want but Kane is one of the best strikers, at Spurs
One goal past Newcastle and a fan had a hart attack
Dier sticking one in - perhaps trying to impress the new bosses at Newcastle!
Is it me or were Ant and Dec sitting the wrong way round, it’s never Dec and Ant. It’s never Dec and Ant
0:32 that touch
Best wishes go out to the Newcastle fan
I hope Newcastle get relegated
I thought Newcastle going a man down, I would've expected Spurs to up their game a bit and go for the kill which would have gone some way in improving their negative goal difference. They sat back playing negative tactics passing the ball from a progressive area of the pitch back to the back line in a repetitive manner and throughout the remainder of the game.. Very annoying indeed as this helped Newcastle to come into the game. Spurs would not get away playing like this against a top four side .
Tottenham kit looks dirty
Today everyone were supporting Tottenham against Those Embassy butchers of Saudis!!!
Best wishes go out to the fan that had a heart attack
Can you upload the West Ham highlights from today please
Good luck and thoughts are with his family, hoping for a speedy recovery 🙏
Ant and Dec chillin at 0:27
Christ, is this a season of bad kits? There are proper eysores all over the prem!
For the love of football, can you please bin Hinchcliffe off?
Very unprofessional commentary from Martin Tyler. He’s supposed to be impartial
Spurs fans were singing: "No noise, from the Saudi boys" :)
I just hope that supporter is all good.
You can tell Newcastle are one Sky Sports new favourite teams with the way Martin Tyler reacting to their goal compared to Spurs equalizer   Also prays to the fan who had the heart attack  🙏
Well, all  decent people were wishing for a Newcastle defeat.   Relegation would be a bonus.
Martin Tyler sounds so miserable when Spurs score. What an unprofessional commentator he is.
Lol i saw ant and dec near to the chairman
Can I just point out how utterly deflated the commentator Tyler sounds (as opposed to his elation when Wilson opened) when spurs score. He is completely biased. The whole Sky panel  built a narrative about the rebirth of Newcastle it was a joke. That was the most one sided 2-3 you will ever see Spurs should have won 6 or 7 1.
Do we know if the defib was used? Or did CPR suffice.
That’s a quality third goal from team play and Ndombele showed us a glimpse of what he can be about.
That tottenham kit is so ugly
From a Liverpool fan hope the Newcastle fan makes a complete recovery,Dellboy
Even with the big bucks, its going to be a real battle for Newcastle to stay in this league but good luck to them. Ps those purple shirts of spurs.....OMG
That Newcastle fan must of only j heard ab the takeover 😂😂😂
Martin Tyler needs to retire
Get well soon to that poor fella seriously. Watching Newcastle is a heart attack waiting to happen, he needs to stay clear now regardless.
As a spurs fan, I wish the Newcastle fan a speedy recovery, football is less important than public health and both sets of fans pray and wish this man survives and never goes through anything like it again
New owners, same crap team and manager
commentators weren't to excited about ndombeles goal
Good on the Spurs lads for pointing attention to the Newcastle fan. At the end of the day we're all humans and it was very good from them to put football aside. From an Arsenal fan ❤️🤍
Why don't refs just keep their red cards somewhere handy? The yellow pops straight out and the red is like they're checking they haven't lost their wallet.
What are the chances Rafa is reinstated?
that is one ugly spurs kit
0:35 that touch tho😍
What a an absolute corker year g a game this was
Dwight Gayle 26 league goals for Newcastle, Joe Linton 7 league goals for Newcastle. Gayle never starts. Bruce is looking to get sacked to get his 8 million....
Martin Tyler needs to retire.
Ndombele is looking better and better with every game.
How many Horcruxes does Shelvey have left?
0:17 too much money
vaccine related spike protein heart attacks are becoming the norm.
Kane’s goal should’ve never been allowed, he was miles offside it’s acc crazy💀💀
Nuno lost all my respect when the fan needed attention he was trying to stop the ref stopping the action who does that!
Two small clubs fixture
Was a joy watching Ndombele today. He ran the show. Spurs in general were very impressive. Good to see them playing with a bit of swagger.
As much as I respect him for what he’s done, matting Tyler has to go. Ignored regullions amazing touch and reacted to ndombeles finish as it was a tap in.
It would be hilarious if Newcastle get relegated.
Stadium full of jabbed people.. Heart attack was a just coincidence.
That new era looks very similar to the old era.
Hopefully the fan makes a full recovery 🙏❤
Now all lane needs to do is just keep this form going, for spurs and also for england
Brilliant finish by Dier. Let's hope for more of the same.
I.SIS United
I was shocked Kane scored, but not that shocked blimey
As a Newcastle fan, it was a shame about the result, but massive respect to the Spurs players , for helping that Newcastle fan out today
I feel like this game is a prediction for Newcastle's future. So much hope to start, then success is briefly realised, before being crushed under an ocean of despair, a further brief flash of hope, then finally, disappointment.
ISIS United
Eric Dier doing a best impression of Phil Jones when playing against Newcastle  lol but probably saved a person's live so can't fault him and he's a hero for that and calling for help.
Hope this person is feeling good and hope he makes he speedy recovery x
Why ain’t West Ham been uploaded
Massive respect to the scums players here. Rivalry is all good banter but life means so much more than football. Their quick thinking may have saved that man's life and that is beautiful to see no matter who you support. Well done Reguillon and Dier especially 👏. Proud day for all Tottenham fans for their class. Now hopefully they lose the next game
Might have known old bobblehead Kane would get on the score sheet today. It's like playing with ten men though when he plays for England.
Tbf, if I was a magpie right now, I’ll probably have a heart attack too. They are the richest club in the world!!! ( on a real tho I hope he’s okay)
It had to become but he looks off the pace
Unfortunately Newcastle won’t change much even with all the new Money they have until the transfer window
Harry kane playing hoping to get a move to Newcastle lol
Ndombele needs to start every match with Dele they will be a force, are you listening Nuno.
the way ndom struck that so sweet, and there people that don't rate him you know😂
What do these commentators have against Tottenham
Son has no respect to that poor Newcastle fan shouldn’t have celebrated
ant n dec sat thereinfront of the blood money
Steve Bruce is on suicide watch! Poor old boy
Guy in the crowd at 1:08 face soon changed after the var decision😭
2 wingbacks playing full backs v son and moura nice one Bruce
Hopefully the Arabs kept their receipts after that performance
That Kane fellow looks like he's been doing that for years.
Dier got real unlucky, from the 5th to the 85th minute he was an absolute rock, just gets caught out a little too easy
where's the everton vs west ham highlights?
Harry kane..Painter and decorator
I would like to see reaction of new owners at ful time .not when goal was scored 😂
Props to reguílon
Dier trying to get that big signing in bonus for his Jan move
How can any sane footballing person watch this tripe and believe Bruce doesn't deserve the sack? 8 games - 0 wins - 19 conceded
God I despise Martin Tyler. So bored with any goal that doesn't fit his agenda/narrative
Lots of heart attacks happening recently - very strange.
martin 'lifeline' tyler.
Opening goal? Unbelievable. Fairy tale. JOG ON lol
Who noticed ant and dec in the celebrations at 0:19
0:17 ant and dec casually celebrating ahead of new owners
2:55 Just like Phil Jones did vs Newcastle in 2013 PS: ⚫️⚪️I hope that Newcastle fan is okay!⚪️⚫️
Well done to everyone involved for helping the fan get medical attention, he’s now stable in hospital so they potentially saved his life 👍🏻
Regime was the worst word he could possibly have used to describe newcastles new owners
Hope the fan gets better
As long as Eric dier is in Tottenham defence or any defence whatsoever, forget about the outcome. And if Tottenham think that they can win any silver ware with Eric dier, they are the most deluded club, I have ever done business with.
Eric Dier could nothing about that goal.  Get over it.
Parry pane is FINISHED
Eric diers been so bad for so many years how is he still consistently playing for spurs lol
martin tyler sounded like he was about to cry for all of spurs goals
wereis west ham
@2:02 SKY wanted a fairy tale so bad, that goal was praised on the coverage I was watching.
First off hope the fan is okay and big respect to the spurs players who took action 🤝  I hope this is Bruce's last game, we got off lucky that it was only a 1 goal deficit, we need a big change if we are going to stay up
Rock the casbah! Rock the casbah!
It will be hilarious if Newcastle get relegated this season. Richest team in the world in the championship.
Dier is a transfer target for NUFC.
Where is West Ham highlights?
What a future they have !
newcastle announce eric dier in the summer
If the Saudis can pass the ‘fit and proper person test’ then expect North Korea to be the next state to buy a slice of English football…
Big ups to Eric dier for asking the medics if they had a defibrillator
Harry Kane Welcome to Newcastle United
I would have a heart attack aswell seeing kane finally score in front of me😂😂
The New Arab owners regret buying Newcastle now 😂😂😂😂😂
Hope the fan is okay
Tired of hearing Martin Tyler commentate on football the man sounds so drowsy, takes away the excitement from the game. He used to be very upbeat but now just sounds miserable.
Hope that fan is okay Who clasped
Brilliant work
Where are the West ham highlights?
Think this game shows how tactically unaware steve bruce is. People keep comparing bruce to benitez. Fair enough they finished the same place in the league but anyone who watches and understands football will see how far we've regressed defensively under bruce. We totally lacked that desire to win a football match in the second half . Bruce needs to go
Owners getting slightly carried away at the first goal, soon realising what they have on their plate.. relegation
Eric Dier trying to catch the eye of Newcastle owner
Judge Newcastle after January
Newcastle regime.. Yeah it’s definitely a regime alright
Used all of his energy on Commentating the Newcastle Goal after that it I was starting to wonder if he had a stroke or something. Very lethargic and monotone commentating for 90% of the game. Very strange considering it had 5 goals too
As a neutral I would be delighted to see Newcastle go down!
Nice that we crashed their big day hope they go down and never succeed
Where is the West Ham game?
Where is the west ham vs  Everton highlights
if thats pogba the title is "pogba finally scores first of the season with the help of controversial VAR call"
the roar from Wilsons goal 🤩
Get a new manager in to sort out the defence. Few key signings in January. Survive this season. Start competing the seasons after. It'll be a slow process but we'll get there eventually. It was nice to see some hope for once.
The best excitement I’ve ever seen of Martin Tyler when Callum Wilson opened the scoring.
Wishes go out to the Newcastle fan that had a medical issue 🙏
As a spurs fan I hope that Newcastle supporter gets better soon
Again, NCUC did not play too badly but a defeat will cost Bruce's release.
Richest team in the championship ?
0:30 ant and dec
SCHOLES
Newcastle will get relegated 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The start of a new era? Yeah, in The Championship😀😁😂
Nice header dier  🤪
Kane was offside Looks like VAR is giving him the same treatment as the english press and just allowing him away with anything
COYS
Best of luck to the poor man 😭❤️
A game full of tension and nerves Newcastle is not a quick fix. I expect there will be changes soon but it will take years to solve this problem and lots of money. Newcastle are so far away at the moment from being a top side the owners will need to flex their muscles in the transfer market but firstly find a manager who can turn this around because I don't think Bruce will be that guy. Good luck Newcastle from a man city fan.
Respect to everyone at that stage and tonight
Newcastle will turn into Man City but with actual history!
If only we had as much talent in defence 😂
House of saud, Is chopper Harris still playing, if results don't change heads will roll.🤔
Bruce Out
Wilson is honestly so good, for me one of the most reliable Strikers, but sure Kane is so good
Happy Steve Bruce day that’s what the rat gets lots of love swfc
The result is to be expected, but the Geordies at least now can be reasonably assured they will be at a Spurs level within 2-3 years.
that own goal from Eric Dier was just so unlucky, you could see he was aiming to head it away but it just hit his knees and went in, he shouldn't feel ashamed for that, there was nothing he could do. COYS  PS. My thoughts and prayers are with you Newcastle fan, I wish you a speedy recovery my friend.
Who else saw ant and dec
Guarantee the fan who collapsed was double pricked with poison
Where are the West Ham highlights?
Bruce has better players he would do well with Newcastle better than lampard etc I know man’s being treated disgusting!!
Halal the lads
Martin Tyler had Newcastle in his acca
It's gonna be hilarious when one of the richest clubs in the world get relegated
Kane is still unsettled. As for Newcastle, something needs to be done and quickly if they are to stay in the top flight. Steve Bruce is a decent bloke but he is unfortunately like a lot of other ex players that never achieve success as a manager.
Happy to hear the fan was stabilised. Hope for a speedy recovery. Glad he's ok
Why'd they stop showing the Newcastle owners after Newcastle went behind?
Martin Tyler's commentary was awful today. Barely reacted to the ndombele goal but got so excited when wilson scored a header.
However that fan is hope u get well soon
Sending all wishes to the person with the heart attack get well soon ❤️ 🙏
Banging finish from Dier against a world cup winning goalkeeper
Awful awful commentary especially on Spurs goals
anyone spot Ant & Dec at 30 seconds
I was up there. He was actually 3 seats away and he’s okay. (The guy who had a heart attack)
Yes I hope the fan is ok.
It's not how u start it's how u finish.Coys.
Eric Dier & Phil Jones would be an epic centre back pairing.
Hope the fan is ok and well done for the match being temporarily stopped, also decent game and thankfully new start from now on in with the club management and definitely need a good clear out as some players need to chucked out
Reality has sunk into the new owners. They realised that they’re going to achieve something money can’t buy….FAILURE!
Spurs fan great win. Hope the fan is ok! 🤞🏻
That's the best own goal I've ever seen! The lad put power behind that header, no keeper was saving that!🤭
Not even a takeover and all that money can motivate or inspire Newcastle to a win!
COYS WE ARE THE N17 FIRM SPURS FOR LIFE
That's impressive they best a team with a 320 billiond dollar purse.
Saudi Owners: ight imma head out
A same Spurs won!
Useless prattt
Thoughts to the fan who took ill! 🙏
As I'm Liverpool fan time for Bruce get sacked u need better manger who knows about football
1:07 that fan swearing at him tho.    🤣🤣
Hopefully that Newcastle fan is ok🖤🤍
Can somebody please check that Martin Tyler is ok?  he always sounds so upset when Spurs score I think we might need to check up on him.
Shame on sky sports for zooming in on hoeborg for a good 30 sec after the incident and then mentioning Erikson
Martin Tyler, you're a legend, there is no doubt.. But its time to retire.. Little energy, little enthusiasm for every game now. I hope that fan gets well soon!
From that angle it looked like Kane was just offside
Delighted Newcastle lost and hopefully they go down.
Laughing at the lad who stuck his fingers up when the offside flag was up 🤣
Great result for Spurs.  Wishing the Newcastle fan a speedy recovery 🤍🖤
Gotta love old reality coming back to dampen the mood 😂 place was bouncing then turned into a library about 20 minutes in
Kane scores !!!! £200 million!!
The new owners have to get their new manager in quick, identify targets and have a very productive transfer window or  Newcastle are in real danger of getting relegated this season
OMG DID I JUST SEE KANE PASS YES PASS THE BALL IN THE BOX 😮
New owners celebrating like they knew where Newcastle was six months ago. 😂
Reguilon had a class game
Still a weak squad, carnt do nothing until January.   A new decent keeper to kick off with.  Then buy 2 decent defenders and a top playmaker in the middle.  A proven striker up front with wilson. With st maxim havin a free role beyond the two .  That should pull the mags oot the brown stuff until the summer spend  to strengthen again. 👌 Btw, since chubby was so tight over a decade and spent next to nowt, does that mean we can spend more than usual when it comes to the fair play rules on transfers 😆
They'll need every penny of that dirty money. Bloody awful team.
Where’s the west ham highlights ?!??!
NUFC neednt worry, they will be top 4 in a year or two and UCL winners by 2025.
That Spurs kit is absolute muck 😭
Supporter needed medical help means likely he had the shot, Shh dont say anything.
Maybe that fan just heard news that they are the richest club in the world
How many own goals has Eric DIRE scored?
Upload the everyon Vs west ham highlights
So now Kane wants to score and get big FPL points 🤦‍♂️🤣
hate to see it as an arsenal fan but ndombele has world class potential
2:55 You could say.... That was a dire mistake.
"Newcastle Regime" lol
Im a spurs fan but lets not get gassed it was only Newcastle and right now there nowhere near contention
Has the admin forgot that Neverton exist?
Dier> gabriel they say🤨
0:28 Ant & Dec !!
Who’s the girl on the left 18 seconds
Yet another dismal Newcastle performance. After scoring,their midfield went to sleep. Willock and Longstaff bossed by Spurs no 5, Hojberg who looked a world beater with his possession pass and space play. Moura also different class to Uniteds very poor defence. The new owners have a right old job on, trying to save the Magpies from relegation this time around.
If Kane gets back his form and the way son is playing they be 🔥 this season
Why are people in the comments making statements like they’re the footballers 😂😂😂😂😂 “happy to get the three points and see Kane get a goal all our thoughts go out to the Newcastle fan I hope he has a full recovery” 😂😂😂😂
Any1 Notice Ant And Dev In The Bottom Left At 0:20
Hope that fan is doing ok. Good performance by spurs tho
What a waste of talent saint maximan rotting at that club
How’d did they already manage to sign Dier? The money talks.
Newcastle needs to spend some money on their defence.
What a goal from Eric dier
Imagine the world's richest club gets relegated🤣  Also I hope that fan is okay, was it a heart attack or something??
Kane scores and the Newcastle fans stick their fingers up at him 😂😂😂 VAR correctly ammended it 👍😂😂 Wye eye man 2 fingers to you likê. 😂😂😕😕
Great finish from Dier! Couldnt have put it away better even if he tried!
I’m dead certain Harry Kane was injured when England went against Hungary. He seems better here. ❤️
Why put the final score on the opening screen??? Spoiler!!!
Great win for the boys Let's gooo
Eric diabolical back at it again lol
Could Tyler be anymore biased
Money can build long term success  But certainly it wouldn’t buy on overnight glorious days!
Spurs turn up to Tyneside and still somehow manage to be the smallest club on the pitch
Everton vs West Ham highlights! Lool
even as a non newcastle fan i really wish they wouldve won this
Newcastle might get relegated if they aren't careful.
Will sky sports please replace Martin Tyler..he's just pure misery 🙄
Honestly, Newcastle put up a good contest today
The Saudis thought they’d bought something decent lol.
Mbappe &  halaand  coming newcastle  for playing championship 😭
Credit to the fans, Spurs' Reguilon, Dier and the paramedics for coming to the aid of the Newcastle fan. Glad to say the fan is awake and responding well. Well done all round!
Just imagine that Newcastle get relegated this season after they get take over
Villa fan - thoughts with the guy taken Ill, hope he’s on the mend soon and sees your lot pull out some results.
Sky glorifying this takeover but having a problem with the ESL is peak hypocrisy
All those 100 million pound players must be queing up....oops
Title nothing to do with the fan receiving medical attention or Newcastle’s first game of freedom. No, Sky are SO obsessed with Kane that they use his goal drought (that he has ended) in the title
are you gonna upload the everton vs west ham highlights or what
West Ham Everton highlights??????
ndombele is literally the same in fifa as he is irl 😂
I can't lie though, this might be Spurs' last stand against Newcastle before they buy a lot of players but I do have hope for them and the Newcastle fan.
Looks like Kanes going to score  more than Cr7.
Ole out ole out
Well done to the Spurs players who directed the referee’s attention. Quick action saves lives
I hope Newcastle get relegated
Loool let’s all let Tottenham get ahead of themselves after they beat the second bottom side with no wins 😂😂😂😂
Bruce wants to sign Dyer.
most one sided commentary i’ve ever seen
Newcastle gonna be the richest championship team at this rate
Ant and Dec are icons
Why isn’t the West Ham game uploaded yet? Please 🙏
Rome wasn't built over night 5 years and we will rise and be a force 💪
320 billion won’t be enough
Good luck keeping your new disgraceful owners when in championship.
I hope Newcastle get relegated 😂
Hope the person who needed treatment with defibrillator is doing well I speak as a heart attack victim 🙏 godbless
Where’s Everton vs West Ham highlights
No timer. No Context.
@Sky Sports, wheres th West Ham Vs Everton highlights???
Kane's legs have gone, maybe needs a robocop adjustment.
Sometimes you spend billions but won’t get anything at the end sorry for Newcastle
Praying for the Newcastle fan. Speedy recovery. 🙏🏾
Imagine if loris saved a shot
Steve Bruce stay or sack  but no win at  the club moment What you think ??? Newcastle should do    Newcastle now go for  Graham Jones as temporary manger ??
nice away win for spurs against the latest manufactured club pleased for harry getting his goal
where is the west ham everton highlighs? lol
Newcastle owners will be getting a new manager and entire new team.
Nice to see any and dec supporting there team 😂
That Newcastle side are heading for the championship so poor.
Wait where are the West Ham highlights ?⚒
Hope Newcastle get relegated.
New owners wondering if they can sell already 🤣
Yeah can’t believe about the fan
Way to spoil a party😎😎😎
Who needs mbappe when u got callum wilson
Why have you not done Everton vs West ham Edit: wish that Newcastle player makes a speedy recovery and hope they win next game
That Tottenham kit is truly awful
Well you know. Large cheesy chips.
Kane putting himself in the shop window for newcastle
Harry  Kane be at Newcastle soon
Hope the fan is ok
Newcastle to the championship
Prayers sent to the fan who had a heart attack watching this game thoughts going out to him n his family hope he is better soon💙
Nice to see Ant and Dec go from smiles and laughs to frowns. Coys off to jungle or castle again.
Newcastle can't even best Spurs with £300 billion in the bank 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
See Shelvy still hasn’t grown up… what is wrong with him bags of talent wants to be a leader, but doesn’t act as one
... Dele will be Newcastle United’s first signing for £50 million. Thank God! 👍 😂 ...
Fairytale. 3 goals later lol
dier realised he wanted to get a goal for his new club before the transfer was completed
I'm back COYS
Well played Spurs. Newcastle still have along road to go.  Thoughts with the fan
can we have west ham game highlight
Dier trying to get bought by Newcastle 🤣
Nice one Spurs. Hope Newcastle get relegated. As a Chelsea fan its ridiculous how these clubs are tryna copy us & buy the trophys. We started the trend.
Wheres the west ham game?
Kane was offside easy.
Newcastle need a player like Patrick Schick
The thing is dier and reguilon alerted the ref and medical team about the newcastle fan and how did newcastle repay them? By injuring Emerson and trying carry on the play absolutly disrespectful from newcastle
See ya Bruce
Nice win hope guy who had heart attack ok. I USED to joke about difribilators when watching Spurs. Needed one for last 5 mins injury time.
Trust dier😤
West Ham game orrrrrrrrr........🤨🤨
Romero is CLASS!
Kane with a goal and an assist
That Shelvey chop was class, wish some of our lot had that sort of passion for the team 👍
0:27 are we just gonna ignore ant and dec just chilling
Hope you are ok NUFC fan
i think the keeper is the main problem for newcastle, we need dona roma
What an assist by Hojbjerg
Newcastle fans dropping like there points
Hope the fan is OK 🙏
OK, we won anyway, but I don't understand how VAR didn't ask the ref to look at the Ritchie handball - and if he had looked at it, he would have given it. The whole point of VAR is to get consistent decisions, and that handball would be given 99 times out of 100.
Well done Spurs players for drawing the fans plight to the ref , shame Newcastle players and especially those wonderful fans , Not !! Weren’t so sporting when a Spurs player was injured
Pause Kane started? In all seriousness hope that Newcastle fan is ok. Get well soon
This side is so bad just need to make it to January still in arms reach of safety last thing we need is to be cut adrift.
Where on earth is the West Ham v Everton Highlights????
The House of Saudi Northumbria  ...relegation battle
1:08 look at the Newcastle fan 😂😂😂
Feel really bad for that fan 🙏🙏🙏 hope he’s ok
First goal of many for Kane at St James Park.
Probably Bruce's last game in charge. That Newcastle team though is terrible, the only one who will last the purge from the new owners is Sain-Maximin, the rest will be gone within a season or two.
I only watched the first half, but I knew they were going to win.
🙏🙏🙏 to the Newcastle fan
Where the West Ham one at 😭
Bruce Out
W
5 goal thriller, but well done to the players and fans for the quick reaction!
Hope the lad is okay .. good bye Bruce nice knowing you not .
Where is the Everton v West ham match
Awful defense after a great start
Dier waiting to be on the scoresheet
Hope the fan is doing ok 🙏🙏
Anyone else see the lady in the white celebrating when spurs scored their first?
Glad the fan is stable and responsive in hospital. That is the biggest victory from today ❤
Get well soon to that Newcastle fan 🙏
Seriously why have you not posted the West Ham highlights   Seriously it’s been like 2 hours at this point and I’m not complaining think about people who can’t watch the match    And besides they managed to do the Tottenham game on time  even though it started after the West Ham game finished
Where’s the West Ham game?
Hopefully Kane can keeping scoring and get one or two at West Ham next week.  P.S My thoughts and prayers go out to the Newcastle fan who had to be hospitalized, may God bless you and give you a speedy recovery
1:07 that fan with the black and white scarf 😂😂 what a mug he looks now
Men of an Arab complexion carrying bone saw’s seen entering the home dressing room at the Sports Direct Arena.
still amazes me that dier wore the England shirt...the amount of mistakes he makes is shocking.....more to come aswell
Glad Kane's scored again and nice Son goal 🔥 Newcastle pretty poor, need some big signing in January.
so nice too see amanda and the other members of her company they listen to the fans and they know what needs to be done they will listen to the fans and get n/castle challenging and  being elite silverware contenders
Ndombele really need to work on his fitness. Great player.
Reality check for the newcastle fans.
This is a little blip on their radar, Newcastle's top 4 journey starts next game.
I was so shocked when that guy had a heart attack
Best wishes go out to the Newcastle fan who had the heart attack. Hope he makes a speedy recovery 🙏❤ .
God bless Newcastle united fan 👍🙏
Prayers to the Newcastle fan and hopefully we hear good news soon 🙏
prayers for the newcastle fan
How will the fair play work in the championship.
Poor start but took control after a shaky 10 mins and Harry Kane playing a bit more like a ST which is also a positive 😂 ndombele had a good game aswell
Commentator sounds like he’d rather be anywhere else
n/castle started off so well then faded real soon if the board had anything about him forget about sentiments bin him tonight and get an elite manager the toon army  should thank god for the take over it will save thee season here going forward
Dier realized he was playing Newcastle, so decide to do a Phil Jones.  P.S, thoughts and prayers to that Newcastle fan. May God bless you, we wish you a speedy recovery.
Think Sky forgot about the other game today...yes let's keep it that way
Props to Reguilon and Dier for alerting the ref and medical team about the fan having a heart attack. Hoping for a fast recovery for them
Be the richest club in the championship next year 😂
I see the new owners looked disappointed they thought they bought Man Utd not Newcastle Utd😂 just realised they’ve made a mistake an will be joining QPR in championship next season, I wonder who’s fault it will be this time 😂😂😂😂😂
What a goal by dier! World class defender nice to see him on the score sheet
Kane just letting city know that he can still score goals
COYS
took you long enough wheres the west ham game played at 2PM?
So much for Sheik money!
Watch Kane win golden boot now.
Don’t worry Newcastle will buy kane
Martin Tyler sounds so despressed on all the spurs goals also hope that fan is ok
Where’s the West Ham game???????
As always Kane will have a rough start, and then after international break he comes back with more scholes than ever.
Normal service has resumed
Mmm butter 🧈  ... butter on a squash (pause) a butternut squash? Is that delicious? (Deep in contemplation filtering thanksgiving memories for such a foodiemachig.
BRUCE OUT ASAP
Early
This new ownership is probably an ant and dec wind up. It’ll be on Saturday night takeaway
Just shows how much work these new owners have to do before Newcastle get close to challenging the top 4
Near first
So happy for Kane to be on the score sheet again
So it was Steve’s 1000 game as manager  And could still be his last  But it’s there to say the new owners had an eventful homecoming  Thankfully that fan is stable
Christ all mighty those fans make some noise that roar was ridiculous
2 dead clubs
Kaneee
COYS
Prayers go out to that Newcastle fan. Can only hope he gets better soon ❤️
At least the owners have a bit of limbs
I thought Newcastle comeback but as always no
Spurs and Newcastle
Sad to hear about the Newcastle fan. At least he saw a goal
spurs won but the only winners today are  The fans close to the incident for their eagerness to get help  Reguilon and dier ( first players to react and tell medics to bring a crucial piece of equipment) The medics for doing there very best to make fan stable again and thankfully is ok in hospital   Where would we be without fans and the medics after the past few months
Thoughts And Prayers Go To The Newcastle Fan Who Had The Heart Attack.💙🤍🖤🤍
