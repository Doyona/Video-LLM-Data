Ah. Finally we see the real solluminati. The pains that shaped him. The stress/monotony of YouTube and feeling trapped in the fame.  No one has an easy life, I don’t care how famous they are. If you’re breathing, you will be tested.

"WHEN I Die Will It be PEACEFULLY?..."💯
Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.  John 3:36  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Romans‬ ‭6‬:‭23 Jesus Christ is the only way, seek Him while He may be found, before it’s too late, tomorrow is never promised.

Music video?
Remake this song as a single name it "immortal pain" make the very beginning to when you say "nothing to see" the hook. Idk if you know how to find the drop in the beat where the hook goes but you can place it there then extend the beat for your verse..this shit deserve a plaque 💯💥
Love u So
Love you Sol I’m gonna be honest I was hating at first but the more I listen the more you speak to exactly how I been feeling lately i done came along way from where I once was and lately I been feeling like I don’t deserve it seeing someone like you whose way more successful having the same feelings makes me feel at peace in a sense love you dog keep it pushing

Mr. Solluminati this song has changed my life. My whole outlook on everything that exists in this world, in fact even in the entire universe. I can never look at anything I know the same way ever again. This song represents emotions most humans could never comprehend. But I can. Thanks to this song I have been awakened to many things previously thought unimaginable. Thank you for this exquisite song.
This song got potential
Let’s get it so  This shit low-key a vibe

Blessings and a greet from Chile!.

This better than The first one 😂
Now, "Soul" was terrible. I am going to be 100% honest but this is heat
Rapper So IN THE MF BUILDING 😂
As a professional music critic and reviewer of 40+ years i have to say. your music has fell in quality, it is now undeniable that you’ve officially fallen off as an artist, it’s time to let the current creative masterminds (yb, dababy and g-Eazy) take the lead.
So on the mf track 😮‍💨
This hit me deep 💚💯
SO who did the cover art? its fire
Thanks
Solluminati I love you but please stop😭👎
So I want you to be saved please accept Jesus, so your soul can live on peacefully. Everyone else please accept him before it’s too late🙏🏾💙
I’m a real music reviewer of over 60 years. Me and my team have just went through all of your music and we have bad news. Every song that you have released is mid. I highly recommend making better music and studying the works of NBA Youngboy or retiring. I hope you understand.
Felt pain from this but still shocked
He hard for just starting out if he keeps going he’ll be a respected artist in a few years🔥
Nahhh good shit
Certified spiritual Classic.
I jus drop some to but ik what he on soul searching sometimes music’s therapeutic

So genuinely is the happy rap music that Yachty was tell Joe Budden about. Just makes you feel like happy. And then to have such emotional maturity to take this happy sound and put the pain that you’re healing from into the words.. listen… I’m impressed.

It's good that he is pouring his Energy & message into music. As long as he don't sell his soul I'm good.
Flow on the beat wasn't it also the message was there but doesn't quite feel right this just my opinion but if you trying to take this rap shit seriously you still got a lot of work to do.
So is actually fire🔥

I'm here right now because I wanted to thank you personally, SoLLUMINATI . This song, with its heartfelt yet joyful tune, brought tears to my eyes. I am but a mortal vessel, and as such, I am unable to adequately articulate the sense of divinity and celestial dominance that these angelic chords have bestowed upon me. The whim and astonishment that each soul touching connection left is enough to stimulate the previously sluggish flow of deep emotions that have lied in the depths of my soul. Thank you very much, SoLLUMINATI  for this beautiful work of art.
HEEEEEEEEEEE
