I love Chris Rock.❤️
stallion and the zebra
My Ma has been asking me if I found the COVID protocol mask 0:23 mins in.    I thought it was fabricated through SNL.   Anyone help.   LOL   #truestory
I missed the episode.  Does anyone know if he brought back the character of Nat X?  The revival of Nat X would have been PERFECT for that dumpster fire of a year called 2020!  LOL!
Music was pure garbage, no Talent. And if you're tired of hashtags about black men and say you need to protect them, tell them to quit killing each other and quit blaming it all on white people , just saying... say it like it is and tell the truth. Quit hiding behind the fallacy
You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. I will be found by you,” declares the Lord Jesus Christ!   “What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off? And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off. In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish. Matthew 18 :12‭-‬14 NIV  “If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.  If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. John 15 :18‭-‬19 NIV  https://bible.com/bible/111/jhn.15.18-19.NIV https://bible.com/bible/111/mat.18.12-14.NIV
Does chris have cancer
Does anyone know were I can buy that white maks hood thing shes wearing?
She looks like she’d try to beat up Chris too
That's a sexy ass laugh
When did Nikki Manage change her name?
Megan is so cute omg
Isn’t a stallion a dude horse?
https://youtu.be/bx0XJ2_v9RM
Good gawd. Love me some Megan!!
Megan is so cute
Chris really looked good.... He's aging very well
If you down and need a laugh well this is too funny😆🤣 check out “When You Hit That Gas Gas” Episode 12(Clone Skit) https://youtu.be/x4eazSc2QYM via @YouTube
Thank you SNL for always keeping it real. I’ve been watching and enjoying SNL since the 70’s.   You’ve always been the best.
Chris needs a burger. Hope he's not sick.
If they are trying to do it badly on purpose then they nailed it
Is it just me or does Megan look funny ash with her mask on 😂😂
Why is he with her
dorky dude and strong ass woman, they cute 🥰
Chris Rock looks great for 55
I’m not sure I understand. A stallion is an uncastrated adult male horse. Why ‘own’ that? And why is it southern slang for a curvy tall woman? That’s not very nice.
Okay but what the heck did she ask? I swear I can't get it.😫
Was pete davidson in snl
Did the writers for the premiere have COVID?
no social distancing in this episode tho they make fun of trump for it.
This week’s SNL should never have aired, in light of the fact that President Trump has a severe case of the Coronavirus! Shame on the producers of SNL! 😡😡😡
Is it just me, or does Megan remind you a lot of Mileena from Mortal Kombat?
Hey! That wasn't the "Can you read my lips?" punchline that got pitched...
can't get more PATHETIC than to wear your underwear on your face when talking in a controlled studio environment to a distant camera.
Nice programming for the sheeple to wear masks.
Y'all, calm down. There are many more things you should be worried about than a mildly disappointing SNL episode. It's hard to get back into the swing of things with all of the crazy requirements and after almost seven months of not being in person. They'll get back into it. It was nice to have some normalcy.
I missed SNL but it felt wrong. And I feel like they are hypocrites. The whole show they didn’t wear mask, audience members sat so close to each other, and at the end of the show I started laughing when they all went up on stage wearing masks....like “uh now you wanna wear masks?!?!” Lol just goes to show hypocrisy at its best.
Megan should of kept the blm stuff out of her performance in my opinion 😩
Snl really bites
WhAts with all the fake sync singing $h1t
omfg i missed snl so much i just finished watching my recorded episodes
why are these karens so pissed about them wearing masks? get over it
ow, just watched  Season premiere. IT WAS TERRIBLE. UN FUNNY
Will snl go easy on trump since he got covid?
Watching the premier now. You guys dont like America very much. Communists suck.
This was so stupid! It could have been funny but you ran flat! Your open Trump /Biden dialogue was a joke!  You guys used to be funny back in the 80’s but for some reason you guys became very political and it’s not funny.  Really your audience that laughs at absolutely everything is brain dead. Sorry, not sorry.
Just watched it and Megan was awesome! Such a beautiful young lady.
I'm here for Jim Carrey. SnL hurry up! Upload that video. He was freaking hilarious.
OH, I thought Jim Carrey was hosting.. he just did Biden for the opening.
I'm so early can't wait for the debate skits lol😂😂😂😂
Masks dont work, just lost all respect for Rock, this is a lie.
Sad
Who’s here after seeing SNL’s Skit on the Presidential Debate? 😂😂😂
First time I’ve seen Megan wear a mask 😒
Imagine watching this in 2019
giggles..."Megan Thee Stallion"???   Ist she a He dressed like a girl?
Jim's back on TV. That's what I'm talking about. Hell yeah 😎. Love SNL
Waiting can't wait. .
🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
it's amazin how fast foot injuries heal
this show has gone down the toilet
How is SNLs youtube page not captioned by now? Deaf and hard of hearing fans have no idea what is being said, especially with the masks on. Please caption your videos and be accessible!
Hopefully Jim Carrey will be on to do his Biden act. Bring on the debate scene!!!
They better not be making fun of Trump. I don’t like him so much either but I would never wish death on anyone including my worst enemies
Meghan representing Houston,TX on SNL!
Here's how low we've gone as a country; After tonight's cold opening, we're gonna be having a debate over which was funnier, the actual debate or the Baldwin vs Carrey version. How did we get here?!?! 🤣
Meg the liar.
I hope Nat X makes an appearance
Just be funny. Don't be angry.
Chris Rock ❤️💕:Chris Rock  shapeshifting on the Jimmy Fallon Show - (part 2) https://youtu.be/Uh-jSeXuG3c
After the Covid19 confirmations, I wonder what the jokes will be about?  What’s happening to #45 is a case of “what goes around, comes around” and “The CDC told you so!”
Gonna pass, same old corny one liners, the show is coming to an end in 84 months anyway,🤔
Holdon I might watch this wit my parents.  That gon b hella awkward
Xxx is x ezXz.ex z. D x xxz
S*zzzx X so zce. Xxx *z.
this guy built an 8 foot Colosseum and held tiny insect chariot races  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1Q6VcMsmS8&t=16s
I have missed Kate McKinnon and the gang so much
Wonder if they'll make fun of Trump getting the coronavirus 🤔
This episodes gonna be crackalackin alex!
Can't wait
Unfunny
SNL writers got a lot of material to work with!
#Torysinnocent
It's gonna be so weird without the live audience.
This is what makes ppl dumber than they all ready are! 🤣😅😂
Chris rock looks like a female nurse with that shirt. No hate. just saying.
Savage
i wonder what she had said in her mask
Never heard of her...
MEGANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN THEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE STALLIONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

Can’t wait to see!
They should put Megan down.
Im sooo ready for this

Precious friend, please ponder the following questions. What is the picture of love in my life? How can I show love today?  Loving our neighbors has been an important part of the Christian life "from the beginning" (2 John 1:5). That's what John writes in his second letter to his congregation, asking them to love one another in obedience to God (2 John 1:5-6). In The Holy Bible, love is one of John's favorite topics throughout his letters. He says that practicing real love is one way to show that we "belong to the truth," that we are living in God's presence (1 John 3 : 18-19).                  When I reflect on my own life, I find that love takes shape in simple actions: sharing an umbrella, encouraging someone who is sad, or cooking a favorite meal. The moments when we're withholding love are equally practical: we gossip, refused to share or satisfy our own desires without thinking of others' needs. Paying attention each night helps us to be more aware each day, more tuned in to what the Spirit might be showing us as we walk through our lives. With the Spirit's help, we're learning to walk in love (2 John 1 : 6).              Begin your walk THIS VERY MOMENT by acknowledging that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome the righteousness of Yeshua (Jesus Christ) into your life. Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord of your life. Receive grace through faith by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross His death, burial and resurrection for the sins of all mankind. You will then be sealed, secured and justified in salvation.            Please be of good cheer in praying the following prayer with me.... Dear Lord Jesus, let us not love just in words, but in actions and in truth. Teach us to be obedient to Your call to love. This we ask in Your Mighty Loving name Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. Amen! ❤️❤️❤️
So happy you're back. Looking forward to how you've succeeded in parodying a debat that was a parody in itself!
This is literally one of Megan's biggest moments ever. I have listening to her music since December of 2017 or 2018. I am READY FOR THIS EPISODE!!!  Marty, I mean, Chris, and Meg both deserve to be starting off the brand-new season of SNL, and I am here for it. 💃🏾💃🏾💖🌈💖💖👁👄👁
SNL's timing is impeccable
Dumb hate snl it was funny years ago but now  to liberal and Chris rock is a disease.
There's GOTTA be a Cuomo sketch where he's scolding us like children. It writes itself!
Why she shoot her self in the foot??
I hope this suckazz show can pull through with some laughs.  They've gone downhill for the last 20 years mostly in the last 10.  Maybe im just getting older and laughing at people trying to be funny is now humor in itself
shorturl.ca/sgirlsxcamx468    ගණනක් පවා නම් නමුත් අපි ජීවත් බිඳ වැටීම හිරු
What a queen
MadTv > SNL
The show that has never been funny
Thank goodness! I missed you guys terribly! The world isn't the same without you! Thank you for risking your lives to make us laugh! On that note!...
Welcome Back!
Meghan Thee Stallion sends a confusing message to kids. She says her name is spelled with Thee but pronounced as The. In other words: Go ahead kids and ignore getting an education. Feel free to mispronounce words like Thee and any other words you like. It so shocking because if there is one thing all kids want more than anything is to rise out of poverty and to live a prosperous life. I hate to break it to you but the key to prosperity is getting an education. Encouraging kids to mispronounce words will only lock them in poverty and keep them from getting high paying jobs.
Chris: were not even worried right Megan? Megan: *Pulls out full body suit and face mask* nope.
Jeez, Megan, I am not worthy. I know that's the most "simp" thing a person can say, but it's just facts. Holy crap.
Well, anything to talk about?
oh my gosh she just made me blush so hard and she was only talking for like 10 seconds
Cant wait for it! We're all counting down! 🤗
I wish they would stop being so sheepish and stop wearing those masks.
I thought michael che negotiated 8 n words into his contract
Look at the sheep wearing their muzzles. Conformist trash. All puppets of the industry. Sorry, but SNL satire has been trash for years. It hasn't been good since the Farley days and earlier.
😍 Megan in that bio-suit.
Wearing masks???
There is too much material for this show just off this week. We are in crazy times but at least we have are favorite comedy show back. Can’t wait to laugh.
Their back yayyyy
Chris looking a bit thin, hope he's ok.
Chris should be worried about that “stank ass walk” next to him. Seriously, wtf is wrong with the world when songs about having a stank ass, among other trashy things, is what everyone listens and looks up to?
first snl promo that’s actually funny?? 😍
Holla red rock
Why is her head so big
Can't wait for non stop anti white jokes as per use from rock...
This is weird.
“Nope”
How are they gonna do this? I'm so fascinated. If they had to social distance during table reads what will the show look like?
God I need this show. I hadn't realized how much I depend on it to keep me sane during this world
Just be sure you know what you’re doing to not risk anyone of getting COVID-19.
Does everybody still hate Chris
I can’t listen to him without picturing a zebra 💀😭😭
6  or 12 feet apart please...safety  first 🙏....Love  From Brooklyn  For You... Both❤❤...
Question how can we breathe through these face masks ?
So basically she sold her soul lol. Roc Nation really want her at the top trynna set Tory up.
Let the records show that Red is Meg’s color.
I thought, "Why aren't there any new videos yet?" Then I remembered it's still Friday
I wonder how this is going to be.
Can't wait!
SNL is going to flop so fucking hard without a laugh track or a live audience being told when to laugh and I am here for it Yas queen
With a name like Megan Thee male horse that has not been gelded (castrated), I can see why Cam'ron would make jokes.
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos✌️
Love Megan
This is the first time I see Megan with a mask
Who still watches this show?
ПОТОМАК СВЕТЕ ЛОЗЕ НЕМАЊИЋA; CORONA, MICROCIP I OSTALA VIRTUELNA TEHNOLOGIJA - SATINISTIČKA ILUZIJA I OBMANA! + КО ЈЕ ИСУС ХРИСТ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3840whZ9t8&t=255s
If the Weekend Update isn't joking about the "Cuties" controversy, I swear to God...
Why are they wearing mask? They were both tested.
Man SNL is so bad now. I've been a fan from day one and this had got to be the worst cast to date. I use to NEVER miss an episode...if I was out I would tape it etc. Now I can go weeks without watching it because most of the cast just isnt funny. They try waaaaay too hard to be funny and feels forced.....especially, Kate McKinnon.  She annoys me...lol.  The only really funny ones are the guys left over from the last cast. Lorne is usually awesome at finding great cast but he shit the bed on this cast lineup. This is why ratings are so low. Been down ever since the new cast started. Hope he does better with the next cast...🙏
Can’t wait🥺
....
‘nope’
She's so adorable. I wish she wasn't on that hot girl nonsense
Why are they wearing muzzles?
the dems are desperate when they bring in ole toothless propaganda machine SNL. 😂👏🤸🤸🤹🎉
Please do a sick Trump skit
CR should be worried about being funny. Something he has yet to be.
I pray that everyone who reads this becomes successful in life❤️
How many pandemic jokes will they make this time?
How is she so tall??!!
What Kinda name is Megan The Stallion, SMH!!!! This is why I do not support nor listen to  Hip Hop off this era anymore because it obviously is not for me and I have completely lost touch of it as well. #GoodDay
*LORD JESUS DIED & ROSE AGAIN TO FREE U FROM SIN ACCEPT HIS GIFT* ✝️✝️✝️
Nope 😂😂
His mask was so loose, no wonder she was wearing that helmet💀
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyRsYk0LyA8
It's the Nope For Me
0:27 I don't need anymore my job thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*

Literally 99% of you won’t see this but I hope everybody has a good day, and God bless you
Definitely looking forward to it.
Bro is that the zebra from Madagascar I-
Why is he wearing a mask when he’s by himself ? I’ve never understood that. I guess to set a message?
This song is gonna BLOW🎥🎞🔥🙌🏾 https://youtu.be/voKhYUTQZSM
Moving fine for 2 shot feet
Good job social distancing bro
Meg is so beautiful!
She definelty got sworn in like Tory said....  She number 1 on trending and on snl...  Been knew she was a snake
the way i can only hear marty😭
ATTENTION: You are in dire need of a savior whether you believe this or not it’s true. Jesus is the only way to Heaven. God the father sent His son, God the son in human form, He lived a perfectly sinless life we can’t live ourselves because we’re infected with sin, thanks to Adam and Eve who ate the forbidden fruit. Jesus died on the cross, in OUR place, we shedding his pure blood that washes away our sins, and then he rose again on Easter. We were deserving of death because the wages of sin is death. When you believe on Christ ALONE to save you from hell, you will be saved and have eternal life. You receive God the Holy Spirit when you first believe and you are sealed until the day of redemption. You are born of God and a new creation. No longer dead spiritually. Don’t wait. This is your ETERNITY we’re talking about. You can die any second and can’t go back to this life. Please! God doesn’t want anyone to go to hell. He wants all to turn away from sinful living and to surrender to him. God is with you. He’s listening. He’s waiting for you to talk to him. He is gracious and full of mercy.
Love that girl. Wish her much success. Her mother (RIP) must be proud over all.
MEGAN ON SNL IM READYYY
She really missed out on calling herself megan thee mare.
I WANT WAP SKITS PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE AND CECILY STRONG AS KYLIE JENNER
humpers frizing
Y’all go check out my beats 💪
She’s built like a Horse
Does this mean there’s going to be a live WAP performance?
How much you wanna bet they get even more political this season. They really need to go back to the way the show was when Belushi and Farley were on it. This political shit ain’t funny anymore.
I can’t hear his voice and not imagine a zebra
“Like a gold ring in a pig's snout is a beautiful woman who shows no discretion.” ...
How’s your leg
Nope as meme,  ya buddy
Chris Rock is probably like "why am I co hosting with this trash"
ayyy I'm so excited!!
I'm curious to find out how they're gonna do this.  They gonna test the cast before the show or are they gonna do the show in masks? Guess we'll find out tomorrow!
I thought she was shot in her foot how is she walking.
Well this might have a different meaning now that Trump has tested positive for Covid-19.
0:38 I quit my work because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
If the lack of humor is a symptom, I think SNL might have Covid.
Chris Rock ROCKS!!!!
Yes, CHRIS AND MEG!! This is gonna be so good
Oh my gosh, they aren't even social distancing
Hope she’s doing ok these days
Y'all we absolutely need captions if videos are going to happen wearing masks. Full stop.
MC Gusto vs Meghan the Stallion who's nastiest ?? My money 💰 is on Gusto lol
Chris Rock is a Die-Hard Racist who hates all White People with a vengeance (for whatever it is, may be it remained from his waitering days at Red Lobster), Shame on you SNL that you are aiding and abetting after his last disastrous panned and condemned stand up which he clearly accepts that he is a racist!.. 😡🤬😡
Why the  he has the mask ?  Please tell me, he is alone
Never heard of her
Soooooo glad SNL is back; I can't wait
God bless Megan
Gonna be a wild show with trump getting covid 👀👀👀
Did Chris come to promote his new comedy movie Spiral? XD
"NOPE" I died!!
0:57 my whole life changed because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Are we sure that's Chris Rock?  I mean, it sounds Chris Rock/Bane.
chris rock at thirty rock... playing rock?
Better than Megan Thee Gelding, I guess...
0:49 I quit my work because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
I missed SNL so much
God I hate her.
Not a musical bone in Megan's body but ok
Skits will change as Trump and 1st wifey have Coronavirus!
Words cannot express how glad I am that Jebidiah the speech critic is no longer popping up when I open YouTube.
SNL IS GOING TO BE FIRE THIS Weekend!!!!!! #trumphascovid
🗑
god that’s depressing. i’ll pass
Can....not.... wait.... this is what we need!
She’s bigger than him
commenting after Trump got covid. holy shit this episode is gonna be a classic
Omg omg omg this is EPIC HOST AND MUSICAL GUEST!!!
I missed SNL so much!! So happy it’s back🥺❤️
I would say that those masks are so fucking ridiculous but NY is the cesspool capital of the beer virus. I'm not going to complain about it. It's good to see people actually being considerate to others from one of the most aggressive cities in the US.
Hope no mask for monologue, etc. Not necessary.
♥️
She has a cute laugh. However, I can't help but focus on her art. And yes, it IS mainly boastful accounts regarding her ability to charge random strange men (often gang members) large sums of money in exchange for sexual favors.  Anyways, she's for sure the type of cool lady our society SHOULD be celebrating, in my opinion. Love the message.
We can't say that on TV  It's a shame isn't
Chris lookin like a crackhead
Damnn...all she had to do was.....nvmd.
I LUV YOU SNL!!!!!!
Jim Carrey as Joe Biden.......ohhh this season is about to be LEGENDARY!!!!
*The New Era Has Begun*
Who the heck is Megan thee stallion???  ENGAGE YOU TUBE HOLE
I didn't know how much I missed SNL
Ugh Chris Rock. I'll never forgive him for butchering the 2016 Oscar's with all that white guilt nonsense. America was so much better before everything became about race.
Okay but.... is Chris Rock alright? 👀
I wonder if she knows that a stallion is a male horse.
Still one of the funniest comediens ever. Pumped.✊
We can use some laughter now in this apocalyptic year.
Makes me wanna vote for Trump
They keep normalizing these masks and I’m sick of it
Huh, Dave Chappelle must have stolen his new body mass from Chris Rock.
Dumb
Oh great... stupid masks. That’s what we need more of. Can’t wait. 🥱
Chris Rock is cool😎 but I can't stand Megan thee Stallion 🤢
I can't wait to see Jim Carrey as Biden.
Are they going to wear masks during all the skits lol
Please sing WAP ♥️
Please let us see some WAP
We’ve missed you snl!!! 😩😩😩
Megan = more brainwashing for the mindless masses .
PERIOD MEGANNNN 💗🥰
Yay two of my favorite people on one of my favorite shows!!!
Well, I guess I'm skipping the music segment this week.
How is she walking after that shit that happened
No social distancing?
Can't wait,  been watching since the 70s. ❤❤❤
Is Megan's outfit at 0:24 a reference to Handmaid's Tale? Kinda looks like it. Wouldn't be surprised if it was since Amy Coney Barrett belongs to the Christian sect that inspired Handmaid's Tale
Yasssss
Big scary orange man bad!
AYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE LES GOOOO!!!!!!!
Thanks for the heads up I will be watching it I love SNL
The way she popped out like that 😭😩😂
🙏 for BLACK JEOPARDY  and  Aidy dancing with Meg
Tory is innocent
These 2 looks like they are in that movie GET OUT with that mask on.
I love Meg the Stallion! She is soooooooo sexy!❤️🤪😍👀
I'm glad that #SNL is but I am even more glad that Megan is feeling much better
Does Chris Rock understand how to wear a mask? His nose is dancing above the mask's edge.  Bruh
I love Chris Rock but stoped watching SNL when it became a NBC mouthpiece for the “ I hate Trump” right .
Could they not find a better fitting mask for Chris??
I'm so glad SNL is back, I don't care if they are wearing mask for the skits or not, I'm just glad they're back in the studio.
Yasssss!!!! So ready for this 2 of my favorite people!!!!
LMAO!
SNL will get more views on this than the presidential  debate . I been waiting for them to return .
YAY!! I'm ready 🤣
Marcus the man you mean?
Megan looks sooo good YUPPPPP
Sooooo exited!!
After the debate, really looking forward to the premier. SNL’s got a lotta material to work with 😂
Ya'll are gonna have yer liberal cards revoked!!
Jesus christ just use a animation studio like u guys did for the ninja turtles skit
I am so there
I thought I heard Jim Carry was hosting .
MEGAN GOT ON HER COVID MASK AND BULLETPROOF SHOES
IRONICALLY MEGAN CONTRACTED COVID FROM THAT PROP
Are they gonna have masks on in the sketches, or only in between sketches and during rehearsal?
Y'all had to come 😂😂  back  after the debates  I was I like where is SNL 😂😂😂 New material to good to waste
"Nope." LOL!!
SNL with Chris rock noice
MTS = Hottie.  That is all.
It's gonna suck
I can't wait I have been watching SNL from it's premiere, not ready for Prime Time Players. My family knows I never miss an episode. Whatever mood I am in it always, cheers me up.
We aren’t worried either. Your show is gonna suck anyways as usual.
I'm hoping for a debate open with Alec Baldwin lmao
BE CAREFUL CHRIS!!! SHE MIGHT TRIP AND FALL NEAR YOU AND SAY U SHOT HER   BE CAREFULLLLL SHE LIKES TO TRY AND RUIN BLACK MENS LIVES LOL
glad to see her back on her feet :)
How are they gonna do the skits I wonder? It better not be some zoom conference or facetime bs.
Dis is the earliest I’ve ever beeennnnnnn
I can't stop thinking of Marty from Madagascar.
hey boo
Can't wait to have some good laughs! Welcome back, we need you!
Wasn’t she just shot?
Can’t wait 💜
Happy Happy Joy Joy!!!
Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!
Great more liberal left-wing garbage to make light of an extremely serious situation.... just the distraction we don't need right now.
I'm here for megan 🥺❤️
2 awful talents
No thanks
Did he get younger?
Will all the cast members wear masks during sketches?
There an imposter among us    Red is always the imposter
What are the sketches going to even be like? Two people who can’t hear through the masks? Like that’s not funny it’s a pain.
Social distancing doesntbapply idbyou are on t.v.
I've missed SNL so much
Megan: Chris, can you read my lips? Chris: Yes, I can, and we can't say that on TV.   You just did. LOL
Sooooooo Haaaaaaappppppyyyyyyyy
f your mask virtue signals..unsubscribing..im not republican or democratic, but it sucks that every lame ass tv show is run by democrats... this political bias in every fing thing they do is obnoxious.. too much propanda in america...
👎🏻waaah👇🏽waaaah👎🏿 You find out your partner is a            Fecalpheliac
Megan Thee Stallion will be there??  Well thats a hard NO from me!
I love megha
Good picks to kick off the season
Wheres tory lanez?
Can’t wait 😃
💚
I thought Jim Carrey was hosting
lol they look so damn stupid
I can’t wait, Megan the stallion being cute, while Chris rock is funny, a comedian and a rapper.
The ending Among us and SNL cross over
Sometimes I put ice cream in my socks cuz it keeps my feet cool
Meg is the epitome of Bad Bitch.
She's so cute!!!
If only they had real musicians on the show, I'd probably watch.
YES thank you all for working so hard to make this happen at the studio. I'm really excited for the premiere!
YES!!!
If there's not an Aidy Stallion skit imma be pissed tf
MY SISTER💙

Finally. And with the best possible host to usher in the new season.
Soul sellers every episode. yay.
Megan Thee Stallion on SNL 👌🏿
Didn’t Megan the Stallion get shot? In like bitch if her feet? Like a couple months ago? How can she walk?
Megan The Stallion, what a good role model. Great guests SNL!
The comedy arm of the democratic party is bout to start.
I'm so glad y'all are back in the studio, stay safe.
Heck yeah !!!
Chris Rock should be Obama in the cold opening.
SNL GROUPIES..WE'RE Y'ALL AT 😁😁👍👍👍
Are they gonna do the skits with masks on?
Thats gonna be a cool episode.
*so glad SNL is filming at 30 Rock again!*
Congrats Megan ❤️❤️❤️
Cb4 ate the cake for snl?
