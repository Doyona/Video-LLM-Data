9/8/24  Robert Kraft & Patriots misled Cam Newton & he got mistreated. In other words, bamboozled!  👁👁  Look how it ended up in 2022-23!  🙄😳  The. Chickens came back & 🐓🐓roosted!  😞
9/5/24  Look how it all ended after they did Cam Newton so wrong!   They didn’t even do an ad to thank Cam after he did all of this after Tom Brady.  Cam inherited a big mess!   Belichick lost his job with Mac Jones & Mac got traded. 3 years later!   It was so dirty how Cam got bamboozled! 😳😞😱
They got it back!   Cam is not a strap heap!   Look How dirty it came back in 2023,   Mac is 2-9!  👁😳😞
shannon talk bball n watever wit no credentiala main slot since 2015 unheard of. blacks lives improved since
the fake vax had nothing to do with BB decision to cut newton
I like to watch Charles Barkley talk about skip after the way he talks sometimes lol what a 🤡
Stop forcing politics in sports
Remember when the camsexuals said, “should’ve kept Cam,” or, “Cam is laughing right now”....... how did that turn out? Now Cam is back in Carolina playing garbage while Mac Jones is balling out.
Smdh ..
Surprise
Boa tarde
Either submit and take your poke or be punished!
Congratulations!!! Very good!

Mac Jones is definitely a Brady clone even looks something like Brady when he was young I think bill is hoping for another Brady.
Mac is a system guy and thats why he'll be great in NE and could be the next Brady.
He can be a back up if the right people are behind him helping him with his mentality showing him that he’s a star and they can use his brain power
So what happened now that they got beat by my dolphins 🤪😂, GO TUA!!!!
CAM NEWTON + ATLANTA FALCONS = FUN ..  We could win a chip wuth him in 3yrs.
NFL  was ready to cut 6months  prior to the cutoff.  Cam will be  ok  his real  self  will be proven.  Professional will see so will the fans
TAKE YOUR VACCINES AND SHOVE IT! YOU CAN TAKE YOUR FOOTBALL AND SHOVE IT ALSO! YOU CONTROL FREAKS! WATCH CAM GET THE LAST LAUGH!
Cam hasn’t been the same Qb since he got dominated by the Broncos defense.
Shannon needs to get educated on this jab he’s so discriminatory towards.
Linsten
Good job Cam!!..Not all blacks Athletes wants to be in the go alone get alone gang!!....
I feel Bellichec needed an excuse to play the white boy.
Cam cowboy's we love ya
Regular season we're going to see different ball game as the season goes on y'all know that I ain't seen the kids you're talking about I'm just saying
Cause of COVID. Man look that’s his decision damn
They should add he on as a coach.
So the person that is vaccinated....can still get covid and pass it along....do they still have to sit 14 days?
Hi everyone, you guys can say what you want. Let's see how this young man does doing the regular season. And oh by the way because you're vaccinated for covid-19, does not mean you will not get covid-19. There are many reports where people who have been vaccinated are getting covid-19. Be safe everyone and healthy. Thank you.
Somebody DAB for a free agent!!!!
Putting too much anointing oil on Jones.  So now, any mishaps will be a letdown.  They need to stop doing this to players because now everyone expects him to be Brady out of the gate.
Over a vaccination 🤔……DAMN!
Cam Newton = Overrated!
Cam is so overrated. Never has been great. Accuracy sucks. Can’t read a defense
Cam will bounce back. We will take him in Atlanta.
What happens if he gets the vaccine and STILL gets covid? 😵
Cam newton was terrible even before the patriots signed him
Don't really see the point of this. Jones is a rookie while Cam is a seasoned and accomplished veteran (injuries aside). It would make more sense to have Cam be the starter until Jones is developed and ready to step into that role. Sports teams should consider doing that more often.
I got a funny feeling no other team will pick Cam up. Even though it would probably be for the league minimum.
Dang, this decision came down to a vaccination?? Crazy world
Oh so that's why... cuz he chose not to vaccinate, simple n plain! 💯🚫💉  Nothin to do with his "play" especially bein a melanated brother smh... I c y I'm done with sports 🤷🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️  I hope more folks wake up soon n c this illusion for war l what it is
Last I knew, backup QB wasn't a position you drafted for. I don't think anyone playing the QB position in the NFL envisions themselves to be lifetime backup. Except Brian Hoyer.
Week 4 vs Bucs, I'm betting Tampa gets best of NE. Even if Pats OLine is stought, Tampas D line is a nightmare
Football is Shanon's strength.  He sucks when it comes to basketball.
Cam is a man no VaccineVaccine for me... Protesting
Cutting Cam Newton is making an example of what will happen to you if you go against the system,  same as they did to Kapernic.  This give me more respect for Cam.
According to Dr Kobi Haviv, Director of Herzog Hospital in Jerusalem, fully vaccinated people account for 85-90 percent of hospitalizations at his institution. Given that less than that percentage of the Israeli population is fully vaccinated, it would seem that vaccination not only does not prevent you from contracting the disease, but may actually increase one’s chances of becoming a serious Covid case.  The figures from Israel also show that vaccinated people are 27 times more likely to contract symptomatic Covid than those who have acquired natural antibodies through infection.
Here is an account from an Israeli news outlet: “The country has one of the world’s highest COVID-19 vaccination levels, with about 78 percent of those ages 12 and older fully vaccinated, mostly with the Pfizer vaccine. At the same time, Israel now has one of the highest infection rates in the world…” [emphasis added]  Let us spell out what is transpiring in Israel these days: fully vaccinated people are getting infected with Covid-19 and are in turn infecting other fully vaccinated people with this disease.  According to Dr Kobi Haviv, Director of Herzog Hospital in Jerusalem, fully vaccinated people account for 85-90 percent of hospitalizations at his institution.

If the vaccine worked why would it make a difference id Cam was vaccinated?
The vaccine doesn't prevent you from getting or spreading covid! There are thousands of people right now who are fully vaccinated with covid
Cam won't take the "SHOT" NO VACCINATION !?!? WTF!!!!
Mac Jones looked better. PERIOD!
Maybe he didn’t get vaccinated because he already had covid and when that’s the case, MANY doctors will tell you not to get the vaccine… honestly though, it’s none of our business.
In the back of Shannon Sharpe's mind: "What's your reaction?" Shannon Sharpe : "t's clear that this is nothing but WHITE PRIVILEGE.!"
Patriots get rid of key offensive weapons and Brady leaves obtains all pro offensive players and wins SuperBowl.  Patriots decide to add offensive weapons and then cut Cam.  It’s obvious Cam was never setup to succeed.  Three preseason games against subpar teams holds no credit ability at all.
So basically these guys are saying it's not ability, it's follow the woke agenda. What stops a vaxxed player from getting covid. Absolutely nothing as the proof has been shown many a thousands of times so far.
I wonder what Cam Newton's f&f think of this..... probably sucks.
Next stop. Dallas Cowboys we need someone like him.
Shannon "cdc" Sharpe
What does Vegas have as the odds that Brady will handshake snub Mac Jones post game for week 4?
Time to kneel for the unvaccinated
Cam’s vaccination status had nothing to do with it. Cam has 400% better immunity, because he already had the disease. Cam got cut because he only wants to be a starter. He can no longer throw.
Crazy to think that even with the vaccine you can get and transmit covid but if you don't have it they say you can ruin a whole operation. Propaganda at its finest
Damn vaccination politics have found it’s way to this show too…. Reconsidering if i’ll ever watch another episode again
Am I the only one who thinks Cam Newton fell apart physically after going vegan a few years ago? He doesn't recover from injuries as quickly and has just never been the same. There are brief flashes here and there, but he's just not what he could be or was.  I also believe that much of his decline can be attributed to TBI. As a psychologist, I see lots of behavior patterns that would make me ask a person about their concussion history and not "if" they've been concussed, but "how many times". He took 2 major head shots at Auburn and others against the Falcons and Saints. It's not just the big ones that hurt. Brain injuries are cumulative and he's been playing his whole life.
Cam was NEVER a great fit or good fit for the Pats... the Patriots needed a buffer between Tom Brady and whomever would replace him... they used Cam to be the hated guy and now they'll praise the guy that fits -- Cam was just there to buy the Pats time anyway... Cam Newton has never been consistent as a passing quarterback throughout his career and that's on him... hopefully he'll wind up where he's wanted, needed, and can produce to finish his career how he would like.
Once again Alabama unseats auburn.
they’re gonna regret this, mac 10 is no TB12
I like MAC Jones. He looks like a Tom Brady.
Great job Cam..  you could have gain the world ....how many people can say they where as grounded as you.....
I'd love for the Rams to grab him. But they gave up too much to get the other guy.. 😔
Dressing like fool head looking like fool . Cam desire to win been long gone.  His head too big . He just got humbled.
We could really use Cam here in Dallas. Cooper Rush as a backup to Dak over Cam? GTFOH.
I cannot get past the Cam hair... I know, it's petty but he's dead to me hehe.
But nobody truly knows about the virus he should stay out of what he doesn't know I respect him but if you know anything about a virus whoever takes it initially is okay but once it duplicates it starts all over again and your first shots will not help you doctor Herschel Muhammad
Cam was a boy among men. Everyone knows it. Cam was more interested in getting that one piece of hair  Lock, sticking up just right. I couldn't imagine him in the locker room.
Who's gonna want to put up with Cams ego and complete refusal to get vaxxed? I don't blame The Pat's Coach.
No that was an excuse, Cam is not a team player and he does not fit with the patriots.
Imagine mac jones brings a chip
It's not a real vx. The side effects and long term damage isn't worth it. You have the money. Retire. You have your  life. 4 years down the line a lot won't.
Enjoyed watching him play at Carolina Panthers!
Take medicine out of sports please. Why does it matter if a player gets the vax when vaccinated people can still both get AND transfer it?
New england patriots 2023 champions
We’ll laugh at numb bill at the end of the season
That vaccination is a scam and Shannon and skip are trying to pass this bullshyt rhetoric!!
bro i just found out that Shannon Sharpe was a NFL player,,,, like bruhhh i’m late 💀
Why are you all caught on this vaccination. A vaccination that does protect you from the virus. DO you all not know that the majority of the people who are passing away from COVID and DELTA. The chances of catching COVID and DELTA isn't lowered by get vaccinated. Do more research and stop listening to your government and news media who doesn't a damn about you. Wake up PEOPLE!
You can still get Covid-19 regardless of vaccine.  You can also spread it.
I don't see why these athletes are vaccine hesitant they would absolutely get placebos just like any politicians out there.
Most of the best QBs set out their rookie year.
Mac Jones has been slept on for years. Back then they didn't know me, now I'm hot they all on me" Mac Jones
The Patriots don’t show loyalty to anybody, that’s the last thing you should expect going there..
The vaccine doesn't stop you from getting covid so that's a moot point about Cam not getting the vaccine.
That Giants game was something I was not prepared for, I'm hyped for Mac Jones. He showed up and showed out. Cam Newton it's unfortunate but Covid struck him and without the vaccine I don't know what to say about him.
The shy syrup univariately fire because france synthetically stain like a abstracted save. damaging, moldy dog
The problem with scam Newton Is that teams don’t view him the way he views himself
All this stuff sounds convincing, until you look at the nfls track record.
Newton won’t get the flu shot. So can’t finish his hall of fame career with honor.
He was a punk anyways
Why do people act like a vaccine makes you immune you can still spread and die from covid the vaccine just helps you fight it better hopefully cause every person is different
Stop calling a Grown Man, Kid!!!
Patriots only want in the pocket passers. It fits best .
research building 7
So are Zach Wilson and Sam darnold going to be cut for being unvaccinated. They refuse to even say if they are. Lastly, Kirk cousins???? Didn’t he speak about being ready to die or something instead of being vaccinated?? Is he about to get cut?
I'm not surprised!!! Cam suckssssss!!! Shannon you can keep acting like Cam is good. He's not and you know it. LOL
If bill wanted Brady he would have did what he needed to keep him. Stop comparing. Y'all so biased it's disgusting
I think it was Cam's head top ponytail.  Yeah.....I think it was the ponytail.
Its cam choice to get vaccinated
KAM wants to be a BOZO with the Anti vaxxers . Take that .
Maybe Cam didn't want to put that experimental poison into his peak performance young strong body and he can read and is smart and can see what's really going on?? Just maybe, or nah!!??
Making no sense when the vaccination will not stop you from getting COVID! Fact check!!! So what’s the difference if he gets vaccinated or not! SMH bs
Chicago needs Cam Newton fr!! Release Dalton
People in this comment section need to just stop talking nonsense Cam isn't washed up it had nothing to do with his performance It's about the vaccination. It's a few QB starters that's much worse than Cam so cut it out people smh
IM SO TIRED OF SKIP TALKING ABOUT A BRADY-ESK!!!!! MAN SHUT UP!!!
The thoughtless c-clamp chiefly spill because shrine kinetically concern by a spiffy waiter. complex, zippy kenneth
Biden: “whether it is true or not, there is a need to project a different picture.”
Some people need help! These are experimental vaccines, which the manufacturers have no legal accountability for? It’s about money of course! To the individual though? It’s just football!
It is hard,  become the back up for a 'rookie'
People still get infected with the Vaccine Shannon...sshh
If I'm the colts I would look at cam I wouldn't see why he couldn't play until Wentz comes back.
Alabama became Quarterback U overnight. A few years ago no Crimson Tide quarterback had ever started in the NFL. Week 1 of 2021 they have three NFL starters that were all enrolled at the school the same time
Cam is Cam first and always has been....🤑
The demonic copper pathophysiologically scrape because flight suprisingly trick through a sturdy route. nauseating, numberless debt
Covid whatever cam is only good if things are going well if it’s not he gives up right away instead of being a leader he becomes the problem lol lebron mentality
Cam was throwing dimes in training camp and in preseason. Even the pick he threw hit the WRs hands before the DB took it.
Racist intellectuals if hes boy wonder for preseason then what is Lamar Jackson? They just dont want black QB to be hero's. The young guy Mac Jones will not last he is accurate but im telling you Patriots gonna struggle to get 5 wins. He is injury prone and they have nothing really to back them up. What foolishness but in their eyes they are smart to not letting Cam shine bc hes black. Imagine if Cam Newton was white 6'5 stud he would be starting no doubt.
Lose millions due to a vaccine.  It's all about ego,  glad the cowboys are staying away from this clown 🤡.  We're have a circus,  clowns are not wanted.
The Tennessee Titans could use him right now!!
Cam is only good for one thing. Modelling hats . 😂😂👨🏿‍🎨👨🏻‍✈️👒🎩
Cam didn't want the mark of the beast.
Watch cam Newton come to the bills
The Tennessee Titans could use him right now!!
Get your Vaccine AMERICA!! Team USA! I got mine. In April. I'm so glad he got cut. He sucked. I couldn't believe they signed him last year. Did you watch Super Bowl 50? Horrendous. Not a team player.
Vaccine plays a big part..Does Race?  Mac Jones looked a lot better then Cam preseason.:I say give the kid a chance..Cam is a beast but Patriots isn’t a place for him vaccine or not..
These guys know you can get covid even being vaccinated right? 🙄
I understand why regular people don't want to get the vaccine, but I don't get why athletes won't. They're travelling to different cities and meeting different people. They're at risk, and putting others (especially their own older team staff members) at risk. So of course the older coaches in the league don't have time for this bs. You're putting their life at risk so don't be surprised if they cut you.
Agree with everything Chip & Shannon said. Now, Brady is a once in a generation player.  He was the secret sauce for the Patriots success. The odds are against the Pats finding another great QB right behind Brady’s run. The Pats will be good but not perineal SB contenders.
Skip reading Mac Jones'preseason stats like he is putting him in the HOF. Did Jones play every snap against all of the opponents#1 def? How many teams went 4-0 or 3-1 in the preseason and went 4-12 5-11 in the regular season
For all you die hard Cammie fans, he's finished.  Quit lying to yourself...and BTW, COVID-19 had nothing to do with it.  Billy B. should have released Cam last year.
You can only have so many surgeries before your old news. Welcome to Cam Newton
Did all of your parents told never take or do anything off of peer pressure or force!
these 2 are making the vax angle that doesnt exist, I watch Bellichek answer that very question by saying that most the players and coaches who tested positive during camp WERE vaxed, that can be interpreted that Bellichek might actually be NOT a fan of the vax
F that vaccine your body is more important than winning damn football games. What will happen when the keep asking players to get more and more shots of a vaccine that is proving that it is not working with people vaccinated getting sick hospitalized and dying.
where's Jenny?
Roll Tide
Congratulations Undisputed for taking down First Take! SAS and Max are history.
he only getting cut because he wont get the jab
cam Newton to Houston or Washington
Cam sucks
Has anyone noticed that covid cured the flu and the common cold? No one catches those anymore.
Shannon just said “one just coach’s in the NFL, and one coaches in college.” Huhhhhhh
Vegan Cam should retire. Oh, he cheated and started eating eggs.
The day of Vaccinations stats is coming in madden 2023
Cam the raiders ,the Texans, giants if Daniel Jones starts off slow he's fish food ,eagles don't trust Jalen hurts , broncos, dolphins , there's alot of teams
Bernie, Drew, Tom and now Cam.... Diminishing Skills
Cam to Pittsburgh
If he is not a back up most likely he is not gonna play at all.
No one: Bill Belichick: We're on to Mac Jones.
Mac Jones is not Winning 10 games with Pats
Nobody wants a clown at the helm.
I remember when Cam came to Carolina,, all the sports reporters hated him. The he went to New England and was the best thing since slice bread. Well I can tell you, after watching Cam play over the years, he need to go from Carolina. Did you surprise me he was released.
The abundant police sadly wipe because advantage consquentially lock sans a periodic beef. harsh, dynamic hill
Skip and Shannon, did you  get your jabs? 555
Boycotte all teams that violate the human rights of their players.
No shot no job? Lets extend that to abortion ok? CAM SUE THE NFL and the " PATRIOTS"
It's obvious neither of these tow have done their research on this "experimental vaccine" and they've both taken it. SMH. If you're supposed to Love yourself why would you put poison in your body? Something that has not been properly tested and IS CAUSING DEATHS AND ADVERSE CONDITIONS?? And he's getting punished because he wasn't part of the go along get along gang. Y'all do know that people that are vaccinated are still catching Covid, right??
Well my Colts need a QB. Wentz will hurt his whole body first time he throws this season....
Shannon always keeps it 💯
I hope he sues!
I believe the vaccination had nothing to do with the release of Cam Newton.
One guy vaccinated one guy isn't?  Lol.  Cam doesn't want that graphene oxide injection.
Tampa needs to pick up cam cause they back ups suck
I NEVER seen a more racist organization than the New England Patriots. They get a bunch of shiny new weapons and dont even give Cam a chance. In New England they dont want a black QB. MOST RACIST organization in all of sports
The mute cart angiographically form because channel intraorally battle during a kindhearted crocus. optimal, hypnotic trousers
Why would Kam get the jab if he already recovered from COVID-19 last year? Shannon need to educate hisself on how the immune system works. Why put your healthy immune system in jeopardy for a sport? Smh!
belichick may have done it again with his Brady 2.0 in the year 2021
It’s asinine that players that have already had COVID are pressured to get the vaccine. It’s like getting the chickenpox vaccine after you’ve already had it.
ET is finally phoning home. Question is, who's going to pick ET( killa Cam) up? Lol
I called this... cam is waaaay overrated & I saw jones was running BELICHICK'S offense extremely well. Reminded me of brady when he was a rookie with the precision. I'm not surprised
Can't say Mac played better unless he is facing the same defence
SORRY HE GOT CUT BUT GET THE SHOT HE HAS KIDS BE SMART PPL DAMN GO TO THE HOSP, GRAVE YARDS ETC TELL THE FAMILIES ABT THIS VIRUS WE ND TO THINK PPL R DYING TO BE A LEADER BE A LEADER LORD HLP US🙏🤦‍♀️
I’m anti Steelers but they should pick Cam up since they need to be run dominant team anyway based on their defensive dominance we all know Ben is done and it would be actually a conversation of 2nd best qb in that division
Cam was supposed the mentor the young QB and build his confidence, not refer to him as Mac and Cheese in interviews and be awkward on the sideline.
And the vaccine still don't prevent you from getting covid
Jones played against the non starters so let us not get crazy.  Belchick played regulars
I knew The old Cam was gone when he started growing that crazy hairstyle
I just don't understand why if he's already had COVID, and knows for a fact it's real, why he wouldn't get the vaccine. I do hope Cam gets another chance somewhere, but idk if he will.
Is Cam vacsted or not? Thought he said no comment.
Definitely putting all his eggs in the same basket with Mac. Excited to see what happens this season, but brutal if it doesn’t work out
Imagine living in a world where u get fired for not getting an injection that doesn't stop u from spreading or getting it. Make this make sense. I'm living in 🤡🤡🤡 world.
How many times did the Patriots cheat and win the Superbowl?
The vaccine rules of  the NFL are ridiculous.  But what else should we expect from a league that has made countless stupid decisions in recent years.
Bill just made his worst choice
Cam has had COVID! Why tf would he need the vaccine? Natural immunity created by a natural infection by the virus creates stronger antibodies than the vaccine immunity.... any medical virologist will attest to that! They are just arbitrarily asking him to get the vaccine so it puts ignorant and naive individual's minds at ease... just like the fvcking masks. I dont blame Cam... id say "get fvcked" too!
Does anybody understand that having Covid is natural immunity! I wouldn’t get a shot that takes away my more robust natural immunity! Cam Newton seems to understand that.
Cam Newton was released because of being unvaccinated. We need to quit bullshitting. He didn’t have performance issues on the field, nor conduct issues off the field. The Patriots gave him a contract extension 6 months ago, and releasing him?! Nah. He’s a victim of medical discrimination. Cam should lawyer up.
Shannon stop pushing this vaccine on out people. Can we trust you? Can we count on you?
He wasn’t that great of a QB anyway , one of the biggest crybaby’s in the NFL . I,ll be Surprised if any team picks him up now that the season is almost in full swing .
Cam is a awesome individual an love him as a person but for w.e reasons maybe the shoulder injury i dunno  He's just not a good player anymore
As a patriots fan im not suprised once Josh McDaniels seen Mac Jones could at least throw more then 5 yard check downs he told Bill I Want Mac Jones  as my starter  Keeping Cam Around after that would just be a distraction mine as well end all the speculations now!
Patriots are going for the perfect season 2021 with 17-0 mark and their will winning the next superbowl until their dinasty become on the most superbowl winner team ever existed on the NFL.
And by the way you idiots from the CDC itself if you're vaccinated you can still contract it you can still spread it and you can still be hospitalized from it so I don't want to hear that b*******
Who gives a s*** about the vaccine I'm so sick of it. That is your own personal choice and nobody should have the right to know whether you were vaccinated or not. I agree Cam Newton needed to go he's past his prime but do not blame it on the damn vaccinated or not because if that is true that's bulshit that's taken away that man's rights and freedom in this country. And we should all stand up if that's the fact and support him instead of being sheep. The government does not rule Our Lives they work for us. Along the way we seem to forgotten that
Well vaccinated people still catch covid and u can still catch it from them
Not the same player he was 6 years ago. He simply can't fundamentally play the QB1 position anymore. Great dude. Can't play.
Fck the vaccines 💉 props to Cam .👍🏾😊
Sorry Cam we got our QB Mac Jones wish you well
Shannon being without vision, nor being able to see the reality of the fact that Cam didn’t do ANYTHING even decent last year, together with Mac about to set the world on fire, cannot accept that Cam is washed up!
Pat’s go 0-4 this year!
Brains deads playing for brain deads for the benefit of multi-$M-aires.
So....... unvaccinated Cam...........Can get the vaccinated sick??????????................HUMMMMM
Bro these democrats are getting out of hand. They're worried about a man getting the vaccine when HE LITERALLY had Covid-19 last year and is still alive. Guess what his body did? Built antibodies....So what threat is he when people with the vaccine still continue to spread the same way either way...Cam was released solely because he didn't get a vaccine that's plan and simple. You don't get named started and then released...
better than first take
That boy Shannon a puppet
Vaccinated Foh ESPCNN
The 49ers were so stupid! how can they pass on Mac Jones?
I don't know about this one gentlemen. Look like  unvacinated  discrimination.
Plan the parade folks! The Pats are back!
Plain and simple he wasn't getting the shot.... And I don't blame him.... He should have enough money to support him from now on....
Was Skip wearing Batik?, would be so cool if that was true 😄
why should he get the vaccine when if you have had covid you have greater immunity than someone who has gotten vaccinated. Get your facts correct before you make a judgment call.
I'm not surprised at all...... it's Cam. He overrated 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I feel like exactly how they said, Cam isn’t meant to be a back up and was probably told they were going with Mac. So he probably came to a mutual agreement to be released. Because if he was traded it would just be a trade as a back up somewhere
People will start listening to me. I said that cam will not be out start and that he will get cut. Cam is a good person and I wish him good luck in his future.
When cam wouldnt get the poke it was easy to see he was finished.
If this is freedom of choice then there's little choice. It's all good as long as you agree the jab is necessary or good even but when the time comes, and it will, that a requirement you don't agree with or you feel is bad takes away your livelyhood we'll see a different reaction. I've always seen through ole shae shae and he's doing his part to promote the jab, it appears to me.
Cam to WFT or Saints
So Patriots gonna start an untested rookie quarterback, and Pats fans (however many are left) are STILL howling that they gonna smoke the fully-loaded AFC east and win the superbowl. 🤣😂🤣😂💩
They juicing it Bruh was not that hard I watch every preseason game Bruh jus had a lot of checkdowns to his RB but hey maybe my tv wasn’t really working
A person's health more important than a sport. Dont blame Cam for not putting poison in his body
That’s dumb because a vaccinated person can catch COVID and will have to be out the same amount of time as an unvaccinated person.
Vaccine alone ain't gonna save anyone. Building ur immune system is the best way to beat the virus
Cam need to go back to Florida and play for the dolphins he used to backup Tebow back in the day before he went to Auburn
This is downright abuse of one equal rights to fire someone because of vaccine. It's nonsense because even fully Vaccinated people get the drama
people think he has a chance to be the 2015 cam and that will never happen....He's at the tail end of his career and is at best solid backup.
Thank goodness it's the NFL and not the NBA.  Prove your worth every year.
As a pats fan I’m a fan of Cam Newton and hope a team picks him up, I’d love to see him still play in this league.
Also cam should go to the colts
Idk this is going to happen but I feel can is going to become the next tyrod Taylor,idk why
If Cam doesn't sign with a team this year and retire from the nfl.  5yrs from now you will hear how broke he is
Not surprised, Newton needs to stop trying to be a 6'5 Running Back and focus on being a Quarterback.  He had Covid and still refuses to get vaccinated. Serves him right. I don't feel sorry for him.
53 man roster.  Not everyone has the poison.  I mean. Vaccine.  I'm very disappointed in Shannon Sharpe.  You know exactly why black people don't trust the shot or the cdc.  The same CDC who oversaw the Tuskegee syphilis experiment ( Google it ). Eugenics etc.
whos the host?
Cam can not throw the football !! I mean how many years have to go by before anyone challenges this myth
Patriots aren’t playing for a SB for a decade now.
I wonder what's going to happen during the season in the winter when all the vaccinated people are getting sick and spreading infections to other people, if they're actually going to talk about that or ignore it all together. One thing for sure though you know I'm going to be watching 🍿👀
Okay so the rookie kid does a better job than the starting quarterback the starting quarterback gets cut after a preseason game the rookie quarterback goes into his first regular season game with the beast that he did not play preseason & has a career ending injury Mac jones who Mac jones who Mac jones who Mike Jones
Bye bye Cam!
So u can play with Covid this year..if not then your saying you can't catch Covid with the vaccine..which lie are y'all pushing
When we going admit that cam was not the same cam like when are y’all going to be fr
Well,I didn't see this coming.
BB already saw another losing season not making the playoffs. Guarantee Cam hasn't changed anything. BB had nothing to lose.
Shannon a VACCINATED teacher in my daughter's class popped positive for COVID 2 days ago and that's why I'm able to telework to watch the clip of you and Skip push vaccination today. STOP IT!!! The vaccine is not the end all be all guys.
Damn they bout to make Cam beg for a job smh
I just read they cut him because he won't get vaccinated. He is one of the few I have heard about with any brains. I am officially a Cam Newton fan
"You couldn't have asked the kid to have done anything more" how about let him take a few snaps against Starters instead of playing him strictly against 2nd and 3rd stringers and acting like he's the second coming of Tom Brady. Cam is the 2nd best QB to ever wear a Patriots Uniform and he's 2-0 against #1.
At 1:23  I comes down to a vaccine..the thing that's not preventing people from getting it
The Texans should pick Cam up.
My mom got the vaccine and has covid right now.. why is this even an argument anymore ?
I’m convinced if they have a losing season it’ll still be Cans fault
Wow!! They want to blame this on a Vaccine, yet two baseball players fully vaccinated just tested positive for Covid, have to sit out.
Correct me if I'm wrong. If u vas u still can get the cov & pass it along. (Delta)
I'm wit Cam.  If he had it already and fought it off why take a Vaxx.  The man is healthy and in his prime.
Zach Wilson>Mac Jones
Love this show
Getting a vaccine that neither prevents you from getting covid or spreading covid will make you more reliable to be able to play? I can't stand commentators anymore
Wait, Cam isn’t vaccinated? Cam though already had COVID so he’s immune. That’s why he doesn’t want the vaccine. Kind of shoots holes in the narrative that it’s white conservatives that are vaccine hesitant.
Cam woke !!!!proud of my boy 🎯
Shannon is a racist, pure and simple, shannon on sees skin.
Now im100%sure Tampa bay week 4 WILL outplay the patriots there is NO way Mac Jones will beat tom absolutely no way.
ONLY in AMERICA… from Whites vs. Blacks, Rich vs. Poor to Vaccinated vs. Unvaccinated 🇺🇸 🤦🏾‍♂️…
Super looser
To drop cam was too soon bad move. Mac Jones is not ready.. experience in nfl games beats college stats any day
Get punk
Face it: bill had a full season to see what cam had (covid or not) and cam was 🗑️. He'd rather take a chance on a rookie than 2 years of trash cam
Kma pushing this vaccine everywhere pos
What does preseason mean 🤔
belichek interview goin on:   bill is it as painful to talk to media as you show?
News flash shay people who are full jabbed is getting the COVID-19 and dying so don’t do that man .
Why these guys keep acting like people can't get covid with the vax? SMH
Cam messed up when he got that silly hair. You knew he was different then.
HE WILL STILL GET COVID EVEN IF HE TOOK THE VACCINE, so regardless he’s gonna miss time. The vaccine has nothing to do with protecting to team. JUST STOP WITH THE BS reasoning.
Whatever happened to Hurd immunity 🤔
Just goes to show ya contracts mean squat
Wow! Billy B actually booted Cam!    Get ready for more “dismissals!”
I’m just confused cause you can STILL GET COVID VACCINATED! Best of luck to both QB’s
It's not about cams playing its about cams life style.
Washinton could use Cam or Houston.
I bet many who got cut was vaccination status.... u Belicheck knows you're not winning jack with a rookie QB not named Marino.
Leave it to skip and Shannon as left-wing activist to politicize sports again. This is becoming unwatchable. Camp made a rational decision there are a lot of unknowns about the vaccine and his risk of serious consequences are extremely low it's a valid choice. If Skip and Shannon had one out of objectivity they would actually look at the opposite side and say why should somebody be fired because they don't choose to inject something in their body that has limited data and limited benefit for them
Shannon "skip im surprised " Lol
The frustrating thing is,  it's ALWAYS SOMETHING with cam..
Patriots finally wised up, Cam is a sideline clown. They knew that they were not going anywhere with him. If your gonna suck this year then may as well be with a rookie right, Bill?
Nice shirt Skip.
Yo the vaccine shouldn't matter at all. Vaccines are when you put a dead virus into the body to make the body produce antibodies. Cam already had covid and beat it meaning he already has the antibodies. So why would he need to take the vaccine? Doesn't make sense.
Sharpe paid by cdc and fda now??? 🤔😂
Cam gets cut in part because of his unwillingness to get vaccinated. Ok. But even the fully vaccinated are still getting C-19 regardless. The vaccinated that get infected are still highly contagious too, so even if they have mild symptoms, they can and will spread the virus. The fully vaccinated still have to quarantine after they're infected so every single player on a NFL roster can be infected at any given time, vaccinated or not. The vaccine isn't a cure but people just simply can't understand this. It will help a individual better fight against the virus but it doesn't stop infection which is why the CDC, WHO recommend the vaccinated still wear masks and socially distance. So this idea that Cam is not thinking about the team, can possibly be out due to getting infected, blah blah blah, applies to every other player regardless, not just Cam.   Trust and believe that there will be other vaccinated NFL players that will be out due to quarantine after they're infected during the season. So this focus on Cam not being vaccinated as if the vaccines are cures is suspect at best because even the vaccinated can still be infected and out of commission for 10 days to two weeks.
Well evidence shows that regardless they both can still get covid equally. Decision should be made solely on the ability to perform and win games.
Bill Belichick doesn't like black quarterbacks and Cam Newton was just a stop gap until the Patriots got a clean cut white boy 🤷‍♂️😂👎. Same thing with Jacoby Brissett ! Tom Brady was suspended for 4 games
Right on Cam.... You just showed the world money not important.
There were these pundits who knew WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT that Cam Newton will start
Buffalo is going to win the AFC east again
One is the future one is the past.
They need to see the interview on the vaccine by Dr. Christina Clark a molecular & cellular biologist which would explain why he didn't take the job.
Cam has no back up and no starter in him ether good luck with the Houston posers
He’ll sign somewhere… hopefully to a contender in either conference
People Cam Newton is not playing on any NFL team until he gets vaccinated. The NFL told you guys a long time ago but still you guys don't want to listen.
Cam should just retire, man. Tired/sad that they're treating my dawg like an old blunt(aka the Pat Beverly treatment)
Let’s be real. New England Patriots. Had a white quarterback for the past 20 years. The Patriots. In New England where the constitution was written up. So that plays a factor. And lastly the main point was because he want vaccinated. They’re making an example out of Cam Newton to let the rest of the NFL know that they’re not playing. Look at the Bills Isiah Mackenzie. He wasn’t vaccinated at first, then he gets fined and book. Now he changes his tune and he’s vaccinated. 🤦🏾‍♂️
Ridiculous it took this long. If you're unvaccinated and working around large numbers of people you should lose your job immediately.
He’s still on that vegan diet. Since Cam became a leftist, he has gotten worse.
I can’t wait to see this man choke so Bellacheck can cry to try to get Brady back
Thing about sports you all ways gotta stay ready. Cam never got into wife beating or politics issues. Cam Newton just has to stay ready.
Cam Recovered from the virus.  Why would he need a vaccine?
Ok one of y’all get COVID and try to play afterwards because it’s so easy
Ok but y’all can’t force a man to do whatever he doesn’t want and again it’s preseason
Tom Brady gonna put that lil boy in his place 😂😂😂 watch
Lol the dolphins are gonna expose mac watch what I’m telling u 💯💯
Cam probably can go to Texas maybe?
Why they keep messing with my man Cam.
MacJ vs Shaq Barrett and JPP is going to be fun to watch.
Why is the NFL putting up with guys that refuse 2 get the vaccine .... Your choice sure but u ain't got a job anymore..... Deal with that!
Shannon of all people you are not surprised Belichick was never going to play Cam, you and I both  know that so hurry up and give your time to Skip and lets see if he can tell the truth. COME ON MAN
He's out of there
NFL
did none of you in the comments get the vaccine lmao that’s what it’s looking like
His career went south that moment  he didn't dive on the football
Brady goat
IAMATHLETE-  CAM:There's not 32 guys better then me!  Put it like that I'm not "32"!  Boy you know where I'm from!!!
Cam has already had covid. Hence he shouldn't need to be vaccinated.
I swear just the other day these 2, and every other show talking about who's starting on what team from what they've seen and thought and would do. Most, if not all, both these guys said Cam, then today he's cut. I guess his post saying "qb #1" was cryptic. He told the Pats he's 1 or none. Bill and the Pats want to compete and quick, zero distractions. To bad the bills will walk them still. And the phins and jets will maybe compete with the Pats! It's the bills division for a while now
He could still get covid during the season even if he was vaccinated. Stop forcing people to vaccinated me to keep their job. This is ridiculous
Cam will be in a celebrity boxing match by the end of the year.
Cam is a former mvp. Jones isn’t better 🤷‍♂️
If it was a close contest then the vaccine status was a factor but it wasn't a close race.
The materialistic wheel systemically beg because sand microregionally expect about a tacit stream. enchanted, salty range
I think he’d fit In Washington
Hey Skip When does a QB play against another QB? They don't unless they both play defense too!
COVID vaccine what a joke
When Bill Belichick said cam is our starter,  he meant mac Is our starter. He just has dyslexia and says things backwards sometimes. Cam,maC
ATL should pick up CAM as a backup / take over team after matt ryan.
Vaccination will be to Cam, what kneeling was to Kaep.
Vaccine propaganda
The glistening glorious watchmaker terminally love because caravan reportedly label concerning a willing pansy. old-fashioned, greedy wallaby
He'll end up in either Miami, Colts, or Raiders
Bruh it’s not the vaccine, if anything cams got the best vaccine the anti bodies. Y’all dumb.
Crazy stat: Cam Newton is 2-0 all time when playing against Tom Brady
So cam makes a personal medical decision to not get the shot because nobody really knows the long term effects left or right it doesnt matter you have a right to question putting something in your body without scientific knowledge..there is no knowledge on long term effects it could be absolutely perfect and everyone lives a perfect life....or you can be eligible for compensation in 20 years. Its your body its your decision to make that medical call.
So because he didn't want to get the vaccine is why his got cut what Shannon is saying. Man people who all got  Vaccinated on a cruise all caught covid. Just because you get vaccinated doesn't stop you from catch it man. Shannon stop on this one
MUCH RESPECT to Cam for standing by his PERSONAL choice and not taking the vaccine if that's what he decided for himself 💯
For real man this show is just becoming a vaxx ad at this point!
Miami gonna have a feast game one 😅
Aaron Donald gonna hit him 1 time and it’s gonna be over for him
the stingy patriots left 3 million on the table to let cam go, let that sink in!
I’m happy for patriots fans man, I’m a chiefs fan born and raised but I respect the patriots and I’m happy for yall
Cam will go to the Texans. Give me credit for that please.
Except now we know the vaccinated are not immune and can transmit the Delta varrient to others.  Cam has natural immunity which may provide him better protection from Covid-19.  🤔
mac jones hasn’t played one down and he is “miles” ahead of “cam newton” no way.. the media played a huge part in this
Im glad cam didn't get that shot,gambling with money is ok not your life.
The rookie will have a up and down season. But he is the better choice. Taking the vaccine should be/ remain a individual choice
It's going to be interesting having Mac Jones in charge of the Patriots. Brady never had a real rival in the division. Jones has Josh Allen. The Chiefs are going to win the AFC this year, but 2nd place could be a shootout.
Not surprised I been saying Cam is washed people can't just accept it for whatever reason
It's not because Cam wasn't vaccinated. People who are vaccinated are still getting COVID at such a high rate that there's now booster shots being made for people who are fully vaccinated. This is common knowledge. Cam had just as much chance to get covid again as he does if he was vaccinated.
Cam to eagle i smell it 🤣
Mac Jones will not win a championship. When the season start and he is playing against the first string  he will be a bust
They gone play defense and run the ball all Mac gotta do is protect the football and they’ll win at least 7-9 football games
Cam RN is what Carmelo Anthony was when he was out the league
Derrick Henry and Cam Newton would be a dangerous one two punch in the RedZone. With tannehil going on the  COVID-19 list. Cam might have a shot a at running our offense.
Just on Friday Shannon was talking how Cam was going to be the starter for this team beginning this season, what a fraud
Cam will get a job some place  else ,The Panthers dont look like they got a  good quarterback who know s he can go back there.
Well Cam walked away with 3.5 million guaranteed. The Coronavirus slip up, to which I am sure fell all on him this year, for blame.If he don’t get vaccinated, I don’t think 🤔 he plays this year, or serves as a backup. But there is something unsaid going on here. We will never know the truth, on this cut.
Texans?
Bill digging his own grave without Brady. He'll be fired shortly. Lol just like Cleveland
What a agenda,  I'm done watching these clowns.  The Vaccine dont stop the covid, thats a fact. Why is everyone pushing getting a shot or being vaccinated when it's fact .....its basically useless.  You still can contaminate others because you are still a host to the virus ( the vaccinated) so stop saying we all need a darn shot.
Mac Jones led touchdown scoring drives on 5 of 7 of his preseason opportunities. Dude possesses all the upside in the world and just needs time to develop. Last thing the Patriots need is a distracting underachiever like Cam in the mix.
Come AMERICA who really believed that Bill Belichic and the New England Patriots wanted a Black Quarterback as the Face of their organization??
As a patriots fan, this is amazing to see. Ever since we picked him up I couldn’t stand watching him in our uniform. His cocky mouth caught up to him.
Normally I feel people in this country should have a choice in whether or not to take a vaccine.  However, if you want to enroll in the US military, there are mandatory vaccines, and I personally believe that during an INTERNATIONAL pandemic, we should all be required to take it in the name of public health.  This is not a damn political thing.  This is not a Biden drug, you morons!  You are killing people and history will remember you.  Grow the F up!
Hoorah!  Cam is out! Let him go play covid ball w dogs at Michael Vick's house. They can use Brett Favre's sister as the cheerleader 👍
Pre season everyone looks good. , He's going to get beat up, bama quarterbacks are bust .
These retards are trying to take preseason stats and act like beating up on 3rd stringers is gonna make him the next brady is hilarious. Wtf has happened to real sports talk and guys who actually know the game. I can t wait to see where he is by week 5 ...My guess N.E fans want a trade
lmfao, Thank u Bill u made playing the pats easier.
Cam should retire. He's done!
Coach Belisex, lol
Crazy. Most patriots fans are conservative and lean right.   Most patriots fans are against vaccines.   Ill bet HOUSE MONEY that if  it was Mac Jones not wanting to take the vaccine instead of Cam Newton and the Patriots released Mac Jones for not wanting to get vaccinated,  Patriots fans would be going crazy.  But since its Cam Newton.  Theyre excuse is, oh hes just washed up.  Nothing about the vaccine.  Facts
Here we go again.. shannon the big talker all smoke. Last season blah blah Brady, he won Superbowl🤣🤣🤣
I was shocked they ever signed Cam. An black quarterback playing for the Patriots?
Cam was never a long term option for Bill.
Nobody is Brady esque,  Brady is in a league of his own.
🤠 Cowboys Dak is not going to make all year
They can still release u even They already signed u???
When Shannon doesn't bring up race you know he's in agreement😂
Can only imagine if Bill picked up Irv Smith and at least drafted or picked up one Top reciever Mac would sure enough be ready .🐘
Best ability is availability in the nfl.....he doesn't want to be backup but hey if he goes to a bad team then he can start he doesn't fit on all teams
As a Pats fan I wanted them to get rid of Cam after last season! Respect ✊🏾 to Bill for pulling the 🔌 . Somebody will pick up Cam.
Proud of you Kam
Fav Cam Newton moment was when they did 4 hours of "the greatness of Cam Newton" videos in the lead up to the Super bowl before he lost, not his fault ESPN did that but it was hilarious
He put himself over the team by not getting the vax and if he doesn't get it no team will pick him up.
Best move ever, that why they got rings. Shannon, you slur a lot . . .
Cam's obviously smarter than all of you not getting the jab. You all will see in times to come.
So I am wondering in the days of computer readouts and information via standardized qualifications we are relying or at least the Patriots are relying on deja vu how far we've come as a species we might as well use a Ouija board
Damn I feel like my Giants should have drafted Max Jones...
Cam got cut because he is not vaccinated against covid (he wouldn't "comment" "because it's personal") although this might not be the only reason. If you are not perceived as a team player the Pats will let you go. Selfish & not a team player if you are going to expose others to a potentially deadly disease not to mention the Patriots are running a business.
And we're going to find an interesting if the truth is told to what is the so-called European players who are not taking the vaccine and insect members of the team or get infected will suffer the same kind of consequences because just like the judicial system there are two different ways of dealing with things and people
The same coach belichick that said stidham was better than Tom Brady in my opinion especially with that part of the country they knew that the base of people out there would not go for a so-called black quarterback so it's easier to go with the mac and cheese we'll see how this plays out me I'm hoping for redemption for Cam Newton
Vaccine does not guarantee no Covid.
I don't care about Cam these dudes need to stop disrespecting Brady there will never be another Brady and I guarantee the Patriots ain't winning no Superbowl as long as guys like Patrick Mahomeboy and Josh Allen is around in Buffalo and the MAYFIELD down with the Browns There was Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw they was the two greatest to do it than came Brady did it better then them no Peyton Manning nobody won Superbowl besides Joe And Terry Tom won 6 went to 9 went to the Bucks 🤯 and won another 1 man don't compare nobody to Tom Brady and I'm a 49ers fan
9:10 They treatin it like college after 4 years next guy 🤣
I respect Cam for not getting vaccinated, he already has natural antibodies from having COVID before.  He’s a vegan now he don’t want to be injected with chicken egg yolks and who mows what else……
They sound dumb about that vaccine smh you can still get sick even if you take it
First I have the vaccine, I got it 3 days after it was available. Second what studies does Shannon have that show the vaccine is more effective than the natural immunity one receives after having the virus? I'm not being political here, I'm just curious where are these studies?   I'm happy Mac is the starter because he's the better QB, period. It has nothing to do with the vaccine.
Y’all bragging about pre-season stats ?! Cmon now. We all know in the pre-season you see the second and third string defenses. Guys who barely may or may not even make the squad. Releasing cam is a mistake. New England will see that , I don’t see Mac Jones running and extending plays like cam , sorry. And playing in the regular season against first string defenses are different
The Pat system is good. Only thing is the division will not be as anemic as it was when Brady was manning this system. We'll see.
The point of the vaccine is too build your immune system to protect you against the virus. If you got the virus and survived it then your immune system has already built up to fight against it. You dont need a vaccine. A vaccine gives you a small dose of a virus so your body can build immunity towards the virus.
I’ve heard Cam’s boyfriend say that Cam is great as a backup.
Another athlete being criticized for not being a brainless drone and following orders. Absolutely a sham vaccine. Phizer the same people who infected millions in europe with aids on purpose. 🤡 these tv personalities losing more and more credability
SHAY ARE THE CUTTING YOU A CHECK TO PROMOTE THIS VACINE? COME ON BRO GIVE US A BREAK, WE GOT A CHOICE
China virus decided the starter
That's ignorant! Having the vaccine doesn't exempt you from getting covid!! If Cam had covid before, his natural immunity by far outweighs the artificially induced short term "immunity".. Remember people, these vaccines are not 100% effective and the coverage they had is waning fast!! Stop this foolishness already!!
Sad black QB went thru illegal hits when he was a Panther SMH
He is not a "KID" He is a starting NFL QB.
The AFC East about to get mac'ed!
damn cam gotta find another team
The vax against the unvaccinated, and the vaxxed won. Or is it black or white. Shay is turning into the other quy with those type of comments.
They going to get Young Mac Jones hurt!
this is Bill B's last stand. The Patriots have to be good or it was always Tom Brady. As if it's not obvious it was Tom all along. Repeat for the Pirates and then Tom walks away as the best that's ever been. Fire the guns! go Tompa!
I only watched 5 minutes of  Mac Jones highlights on YouTube and knew it was a matter of time before he was named the starter for the Patriots.
Cam Should Of Retired Min Of 2 years Ago, What Team Would Want Him? There Is No Wisdom Of Any Team To Get Him.
Skip i don't know if u are on medical marijuana or u pick Tylenol pm instead of am! U blink your eyes 50 times a minute! U need a vacation! See u when the season starts! Go! Steelers Nation!
Cam sucks hasn't done anything since he went to the Superbowl
Any person who has a understanding of the game of football and especially the NFL. Know how to get a rookie quarterback to start a career on the best route; A decent OL, a top 10 running game, and a decent roster of pass catching TE's... So assuming someone with a million SB rings like master Bill doesn't understand that. Mac is pretty much being put in the best situation for any rookie QB. If they dont succeed, itll be on mac alone. If this happens, he wont have a prayer being a starter in the NFL anywhere, at anytime after.
Big mistake
Somebody gone look stupid this guy was rookie of yr mvp top 100 all that this kid can still play he's known for making people look dumb when u doubt him let him play his game and run the show run do what he wants
Ace Boogie, if you are watching this segment, please read this. You have nothing to prove. We all know what you bring to this league, and it's their downside, and not yours. You will be picked up in no time, because you hold a powerful place with your ability to play, that no other QB has. This is a step in your rightful direction. Heads up and moving forward with your next team. We all will be watching, and you are going to set it off this year. Have you or your agent thought about contacting the Falcons? This would be a homecoming for you and your family. Playing in the ATL with close family is a dream. The second team of choice would be the Saints. This is a popular choice. Either way, you would be back in the NFC facing the Panthers twice. Ace Boogie, You are truly the missing piece to any team. Lets get it done.......
I hope Cam gets on a team and shines
Cam gonna be on a show, "Where are they now?" He will be a trashman somewhere because his sports career is over. Him not getting vaccine has put a Scarlet Letter on his back! Even the talkshow outlets are requiring everyone to get vaccinated.
Damn Cam
Taking a shot is an option yes or no, but people are making jobs and travel mandatory for employment and travel. That means you are taking away my rights so when the government tells you to turn in your guns don't argue just do as your told NRA people!
Even having the vaccine you can catch covid..... WTF is the NFL setting a vaccination standard for????? This makes no cense to me.
Cam had Covid and recovered correct? The doctors say that the best vaccine for covid is to be naturally immune by recovering from covid. Isn't that correct or am I wrong?
Cam Newton WILL RISE AGAIN... The former NFL MVP has ran for more TD's than A-N-Y QB IN NFL HISTORY!! LAST YR HE HAD A BUNCH OF SKIP'S AT WR, OL, AND TE!! HE IS GREAT WILL ALWAYS BE GREAT AND IS GOING TO START SOMEWHERE THIS YR BY WEEK 9
Greg Olsen made Newton look better than he was. Period.
Man I called it on draft day. My cowboy should have drafted Mac Jones with the 10th pick. And let Dak walk. But no Jerry is dumb. the Goat swooped in and got Mac Jones. I even called it that he should start over Cam.
I pray the Patriots don’t win a game this year 🙏🏽
They tryna Melo Cam🤦🏿
Based on Israel’s study he don’t need the vaccine since he is 13x less likely to get it again
remmber when they said cam would surpass brady with Bill LMAOOOOOO WHETE ALL THE CLOWNS NOW
That BS vaccine doesn’t even work.
I think they asked cam to come off the bench and he said no and the released him
How stupid do they sound talking about availability because of vaccine status, whether he is or not vax he can still get the virus and spread it, and even if he is vax & test positive, he wont be allowed to play. Ya are really brainwashed with this vax, living life one booster at a time.
Dam Cam, see you in retirement, you were unable to throw the ball 10 plus yards in the last two years. It's time to sip some good wine and listen to the Migos, you deserve a retirement check for life.
Can’t make no grown man take no dam shot if he don’t want to 🤦‍♂️
Vaccine makes no difference can still get sick and can definitely be contagious.  They r questioning if the vaccinated may be more contagious
Fascinating times...it was in Cams hands and he stood on his principles but I can't pay a dude thats not vaccinated. Thats just it perfect storms
Watch Earthlings documentary to see the suffering animals go through for meat, dairy, eggs. Look at it from the animals eyes.
Big Mac and the Pats will beat Tampa.... I'm calling it
Cam Newton is better then Danny Bust Dimes.
Jenny was also cut don’t mess with skip
It is time to fire WFT coach and he knows he needs the QB manager.  He does not dare to pull the trigger for trading few draft picks for Mac Jones.   Hope owner send coach out the door as soon as possible.
Cam should join the Bucs, and back up Brady. 😏
I haven’t seen this show in a while. Skip looks like S@&%
So sick of vaccination talk Costing a job you still get sick with it, cam is not a 🐑 he’s better then the NFL socialism way it’s always political I hope this costs the patriot and adds to the karma
Hope Shannon & Skip know that you can still get the virus even though you’re vaccinated….. man they trying to program folks for real!
I'm getting Ken Griffey Jr Vibes from Skip he keep calling Mac Jones "The Kid".
RACISM. NO. Mac Jones will be a better QB than Cam by week 8
Cam Newton is garbage if u ask me
Lol guess we know now it was Tom Brady more than belichek winning those titles …. Promise this guy won’t be a Tom Brady just another bama bust .. tua will be a bust after this year too
Shannon does know the vaccine doesn’t keep you from getting the virus, right?
Patriots are going to be sorry that they let Cam Newton go. Jones is a 1 year starter on a ready for NFL college football program. May as well call bama the (minor league) or the (G -league) of NFL.  Mac Jones will end up like another andy dalton  aj mccarron , sam darnold,
Cam is joke he not serious enough to be great
Cam is washed up his best playing is behind him now !!! The new King is born and he's a BAMA boy !!! Damn ant life good !!!
Bill Belicheat and the racist White media want have the Black man to blame this season
This is a no brainer ,Cam choose to not get vaccinated alot teams released assistant coaches who chose not to get the vaccine , next .
we all know what that was all about. Brady - then cam  - nope .  Not right  Brady followed by mac jones yep that's about white.
Belichick strikes again. Why because he has a veteran back up sitting there as an option. And he stills has that rookie Stillman (sp?) for the last three years. Patriots play book is a pocket style operation. Their receiving  plays are precise and blueprinted. not running around looking for an opening.  Their blocking assignments and training for the OFF  line is to protect a pocket passer. They simply do not get holding calls in their system.
The vaccine has nothing to do with anything, ur just as likely to get covid fully vaccinated as you are when ur not. Actually Israel has there highest cases per day just the other day, and nearly there whole population is vaccinated. Riddle me that!! Vaccine doesn't work and they are admitting it by saying they need boosters. If it was working u don't need anything extra. But people r so stupid they will line up to get that too. NPC's just walking around brainwashed
This kids gonna get hurt 🤕 mark my words. I honestly hope not but I just really think somethings gonna happen
Everyone seems to forget the vaccine doesn't stop you from getting COVID....so with or without it he would be unavailable to play if he was to contract again!
I disagree. Cam could be a good back-up for the right team. Cowboys, Raven's, Seahawks, Dolphins, Texans, Cardinals & Chief's to name a few. Same skill- set as these teams starters. Money talk & Egos walk.
Cam trying to get this job paying millions of dollars and He still refused to get the vaccine!??? Wow. Smh
Cam isn't vaccinated, liability, didn't put enough distance between Jones and himself. Plus he was talking Mac up like he was the second coming.
How is Alabama not QB U????
Lol why are people surprised about this? What has Cam Newton done recently? He is not the same Cam as he was before
Thanan Tharp…..one and done.
Sadly, the best fit for Cam is the Dallas Cowboys especially if Dak isn't 100%.
Buh bye
Yo…Bring Cam Newton to the Texans. Go tell someone.
Vaccinated or not Covid doesn’t care so the Anamoly that getting vaccinated stops you from catching Covid is a lie.
Washington will probably sign Cam
Time will tell but this kid doesnt seem to be near the flake, that Brady is!!
It’ll be interesting what they say after the season about Mac. Not sure it’ll be very good
Cam has no reason to get the vaccine other than discriminatory punishments
I never thought  Belicheck and Newton would work. Not surprising. Two big egos can't work.
I think it's as simple as this. The Patriots spent millions and millions of dollars to bring in some guys that can actually catch the ball but Cam Newton can't THROW the ball.
THE VACCINE DOES NOT STOP YOU FROM GETTING COVID SHANNAON SHARP
Cam been under performing for awhile now. His best days are behind him.
Cowboys sure needs a backup quarterbacks
You can still get covid if your vaccinated... you 2 gents are ignorant
That post Cam made about loyalty… He already knew he was getting cut, and he still gave the kid a high five. Nobody can question that man’s leadership or ability to be a great teammate. I hope he gets a real shot. I just knew Cam was gonna get his shine this season in a run-focused offense. Bill missed his chance. This bout to be some bull-jive for the Pats fans this season.   Good thing I’m not one. Titan Up! Come on down, Cam! We’ll take you in TN!
Best landing spot for Newton? Dollar General 1) immediate starter 2) should pick up system quickly 3) zero negative media 4) little to no chance of injury Perfect fit
The vaccine wouldn't stop him from getting or spreading the virus
Soooo? No shot no shot @playing 😶😷🥴😳
Patriots will not have a winning season this year. Not because of Cam leaving
Come to the Texans Cam
Wrong on so many levels cam is still better than most back up QBS but he's black
If Cam settles for a backup role(probably won’t) he should go to the Saints. He’d be a great backup and it could keep Taysom Hill in his place as a Swiss Army knife.
Nof@p / cemen retention
Salute to Cam for standing up for what he believes in.
This is going to be a disaster
Regular season will tell if he ready  Point blank
Imagine this. Somebody tell Nagy to learn a thing or 2.
Alex Curry's smile is so damn fine man
Imagine basically giving up a NFL career over not getting vaccinated 🤦🏾
Cam Newton is a toxic loser. It’s on tape, he took a dive, gave up and some believe intentionally threw the SUPERBOWL against Denver!!!  I know he didn’t vacation in Las Vegas after that game. He’d of been greeted by Louie the Leg Breaker. He cost professional handicappers millions …
I’ve been watching Shannon talk basketball so much I forgot how sharp and fluid his NFL commentary is. Thank god football is back.
Why does someone who has already had Covid have to be vaccinated? Isn't the point of vaccination to introduce the system to the virus to innoculate against dangerous infection? Why are vaccine derived anti-bodies better than naturally derived anti-bodies? Why is the vaccine being pushed on people who have already had it? Something's fishy here folks.
Why are Shannon and skip acting like there aren’t thousands of people who are vaccinated who are still getting covid
Jabbed or unjabbed really? Since when does getting the jab make you impervious to c10? The protocols are meant to divide as commentators even schools are using to justify segregation. The jab supposedly is proving to only lessens symptoms doesnt stop transmission nor doesn't mean you can't contract it. Whether he was jabbed or not, is as segregated as saying tebow only got an nfl chance again because he was white. Bogus how these unscientific protocols are okay when its an agenda to jab everyone despite constant fumbling of the data which is proving otherwise. If the jab works then why the mask again? If the mask worked why the jab? If the jab worked why now a booster. If the booster works then a jab for another strand? Sports media and leagues slowly are becoming CNN
Another thing Deshaun Watson going on the market too
I feel for Cam. I just don't understand  why the pats  wouldn't keep him for this year.
I agree with S.S.  The dependability om something controllable, but coupled with performance as well made it an easier choice.  I almost wonder if Cam really knew he was on the line.
I should be a scout bc I watched all of Cam's snaps and all of Mac's snaps and I saw Mac was better. He played the style that they played with Brady. And I thought Mac just looked better. I usually don't pay attention to the stats so much. I use my eyes
He is going to Washington watch 🤷🏻‍♂️
F your jab shot! You talking demonic! Cam did right! God before a ball?
Good for Cam not getting the virus. The virus is a joke! It don’t work. It’s just a way the government can make money and control you.
I'd take my money and rude off into the sunset....the NFL has always disrespected blk QB. I wouldn't played for NE anyway. They don't want a Brutha taking snaps for their franchise.... The logo don't match. Lol They have a history of screwing QBs of color ie Davey out of LSU & Bishop of KSU.
Did skip just laugh at the end
I feel like exactly how they said, Cam isn’t meant to be a back up and was probably told they were going with Mac. So he probably came to a mutual agreement to be released. Because if he was traded it would just be a trade as a back up somewhere
"Its his choice" So Cam is a doctor? Cam is an expert on virology? Cam is educated on epidemiology? Give me a break. Anyone that is so arrogant to ignore the limitations of their own ignorance is broadcasting their stupidity. Cam deserves this fate. At least Cam just got cut. Go look up all of the Republican anti-vaxx radio hosts dying in the south because of their own stupidity.
Mac Jones got the white privilege.
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
3 and a half Million and out the door! Cam was cut because he is a Black QB! This isn't about co-vid and being vaccinated, he was cut because he is Black! @RealTru2022
Steelers hint hint... yall can make a move before the season goes up in flames.
They just cut a read option quarterback, to “run the ball” heavily… Can I have a show?!! Who do I talk to??
Only way he stay in the NFL is if the Texans, WFT, Miami, colts sign em or he becomes back up he’s worth nothing now especially if he don’t get vaccinated
This the most disappointing episode i have heard  and for that the NFL season  will be canceled  due to sick vaccinated  players.  So I will see what y'all  will be talking about then.
I wonder if they know that if the vaccine is not mandated and you discriminate against a player in any way, it could lead to litigation. Cam is not dumb. I hope his lawyers aren’t either.
Cam could go to the Giants, Broncos or Jets.
Let’s be real they cut cam cause he ain’t vaxxed
It was really no surprise... cam just doesnt have it anymore
Yeah get the shot and get it  again I thought at first you get the your good then it Changed to use food ball talk the gold post keeps moving
If Mac gets hurt who is the Pats back up qb🤷? Always plan for the unexpected, good luck Pats fans !
I think it’s funny that Mac Jones is being compared to Tom Brady… It better work out. Sad that Cam set himself up to be the vaccination agenda patsy…
Yeah when the pre season then we will see
Sounds like your telling us that when you get vaccinated , you cant get covid anymore. You still can.  But cam shouldve jusT got the shot for the team
Bill you could have let cam go to the Bears earlier this year.
Cam should play for the Giants. Daniel Jones isn’t mobile enough to navigate behind his terrible offensive line and I cant see him leading a 6-10 team anywhere near the playoffs. I think with Cam there, they could go at least 9-7 maybe 10-6 and start building a team around him for the next season.
Cam Newton is washed up
Bill like, Yes I can take out option plays now 😂
MAC ATTACK JONES, IS READY TO START, TODAY! I SAID IT BEFORE THE DRAFT.....COACH .B..I WAS RIGHT. IT'S JONE'S TIME IN NEW ENGLAND...THANKS.
The vaccine doesn’t mean you don’t catch it but it is supposed to build an immunity to the said virus but with this virus the definition of vaccine has changed but hey hopefully cam finds a home
I love you guys perspective on these subjects...real og's🤣
Bama strikes again!! We got Cam back for that SEC loss. Roll Tide! Go Big Mac!
Vaxxed people are still contracting COVID!!!  Is the league still going to cancel games when vaxxed people get COVID or are they going to continue this charade
Coach Saban, Coach Belichick are Football Twins
Shannon Sharpe is racist towards white people. He needs to resign.
Stop saying kid every sentence
Can is my favorite player 😐
You can still get the virus with the vaccine🤦🏻‍♂️
The fact that Shannon pushing the vaccine is weird to me, it’s something that’ll make me quit watching
Shocked can't lie.
It’s not enough for bellichick to win SB, he wants to show that he created Tom Brady. Mac Jones is the new Tom Brady, his new creation
Granny newton is done in the NFL!
I'm convinced Newton hasn't worked on his craft. He's relied on his talent his entire career and his MVP season was a self validation. His teammates say he's a great guy and always at the facility working out, but you never hear about him and film study or getting guys together in the offseason. Now with his physical skills waning, he's not adjusting. On top of that, dude goes off on some appointment and gets dinged for a protocol violation. Belichick did Cam a solid by not throwing him under the bus.
What does vaccine has to do with anything keep that out our sports. The man caught covid he has natural immunity better immunity than any of us that's getting the shot! its scientific fact. He doesn't need a vaccine he has antibodies now! let's talk about the sport your specialty
Drew Blesdoe had a far better career than Cam Newton
He was cut because he's not vaccinated!  With the rules in place for unvaccinated players...it would have been a nightmare to work around it, especially for your starting QB, and for someone who isn't much better than the young vaccinated rookie in Jones.  The way they train, practice, and congregate, is affected by vaccine status.  He had his mind made up about it, and NE had no choice to cut him.  It's also a media nightmare every week to have to explain and defend Cam's choice..it was easier to go the other way!
Skip I’ll take 2 cases of Dt Dew on Mac Jones winning under 10 games
Better hope Jones stays healthy
Are all 32 QBs better than Cam Newton ?🤔
I’ll be watching Let’s see what happens
They about to white ball Cam he’s not gonna play again
Mac isn't a bad QB, actually reminds me of Brady a lot. But he went from the best offense in the country to the one of the worst in the NFL. People really think we are about to run the ball like we did last year WITHOUT Cam lol. Cam was 50% of that run game.  His ability to run forced the defense to play the run much differently than they will with Mac..  I'm just waiting lol... If our bad luck continues on offense Mac is gonna be in deep fire with non Alabama weapons to help him. We are relying on Mr. Glass at TE1 and Marcus Cannon Jr at LT. I can't wait til we play the Bucs lol.  Gonna be some funny looks on Bill's face. We went from AFC Game/SB bound to HOPING we make the playoffs lol.
Send cam back to NC
When are these Idiotic people gonna understand that the Jab doesn't work... its been proven over and over by people who got it and still got sick.... so it doesn't matter if you got it or not Smh
He’s a white boy cam is black. Simple
I wish my bears coaching staff was like Bellichick
Carmelo Anthony went through this until the blazers gave him a real shot just pointing out the similarities not the sports.
It’s easy they do not want COVID scares again and again with cam who is too afraid to get vaccinne
The only thing that is scary a bit is Mac seems to put everything behind a throw that ends up 15 yards. Will his arm be able to cope with the volume and still being strong enough to throws darts
BB wanted to start Brady which was the fourth string QB at the time Cam gets cut now all of sudden 20 years ago and today we mention theirs a regret BB  didn't start Brady over Bledsoe from Jump im call 🧢⛑🎓🎩 GTFOH man.
Sharpe is a dull spoon, he makes biden look intelligent.
As a Cowboys fan I would LOVE to have Cam as a backup!!! Or possibly the starter if Dak is hurt
Mac Jones is the guy, no questions asked!
It is not can a QB toss the ball, the question is Can he do it a full speed with a defense coming after him.  The College QBs that have failed in the NFL failed because they couldn't play at NFL speed, and they could not take the hits. NFL Players are faster, quicker, bigger, and hit harder.  Some QB's can't deal with that. Cam cold take it and keep cool.  No one knows how this kid will do.  Experience is important, and this is a very complex playbook. BB will simplify the playbook for him, running plays he can run comfortably...but that means his QB will be shooting with only one gun.  He'll be easier for Defenses to figure out, and to counter, and he'll have more trouble scoring against them, because of his lack of full knowledge of the playbook.  BB did this with Tom and they were very successful, but that is because Tom is tough.  He could take the hits and keep his cool at full speed.  Will Mac Jones?
I definitely think race played a factor if u think this country still don’t view blk ppl a certain way then u should be fired from ya job I garuntee if this was hoyer he’d still be on this team
It can't be about the vaccine, bc even if he was vaccinated, he could still catch covid and still have to sit out for 2 weeks. Let's face it, Billy Belly never liked Cam.
this world has become a strange place.  Ussually it is.  if it's close one guy has to start between a veteran or rookie who you go with.  no matter the answer it wouldn't be vaccinated or not.  Damn this is a strange world!
So now they're taking people's jobs for not getting the vaccine and everybody's okay with this
Anti Vaxxers keep taking L's.
Cam is better than Mac Jones rn for the future yes i Choose Mac but I’ll play this year out with cam so Mac can get comfortable with the system it’s just smarter
Vaccinated people are still getting Covid though...
This reminds me of how the rockets did melo
So Cam was let go because he wasn't vaccinated.....😑😑😑  Child please....
People still getting covid with the vaccine .. just saying
The vaxx doesn't protect you from contracting covid though. It's already public record/proof of this so the the jab has nothing to do with it. But these are the types of bs politics that comes with being on the highest level of a professional setting. .
Cam was really good at one time but he is washed up now
Cut because of vaccine choice, SMH
I don't like the pukes nor cam however the pukes made a mistake cause jones will not be any better this year....oh by the way the Vax don't work
Great White Hope Mac Jones 😂🤦🏾‍♂️
I'm very surprised that he was released but not shocked. But if him not being vaccinated truly was a factor then that's wack
Im not a bills fan but that boy Josh Allen is about to own this division for the next 12yrs!!!
Nothing to do with VAX...  Nothing
Come to the Steelers can we need u
Thumbs up on the non vaccine QB Plus it’s the oats  He had no chance even if vaccinated  It’s new England  Cheat lie and steal and pretend your rooting for the underdog   Come on msn
This talk of being vaccinated is STUPID! The man has already been exposed to Covid-19, he has the anti-bodies against Covid already. When you have had the measles you don't need a vaccination for Measles, you have already been exposed to the virus.  Unless there are multiple variations of Covid, and there are, and multiple vaccines against each variant, then there is no reason to get vaccinated after getting it.    In time, the vaccines we have now will be replaced with better vaccines that offer more protection.  They may protect against more than one variant of Covid-19.  That is a reason to get vaccinated if you have had Covid-19, or have been vaccinated already.  Better vaccines, more protection.    That situation does not yet exist.  There is no medical evidence that getting vaccinated after you have gotten it, is better. Every week we read of a famous person getting Covid who was fully vaccinated.  Clearly, vaccines are not where we would like them to be, they don't protect you from Covid-19... yet.  Hopefully, they will get there soon.
The vaccine does  not prevent covid-19.  It lowers your chances of going to the hospital.   Look at Israel.  This league policy is idiotic.
program poor CAM
No rookie in modern times beside big Ben cam in and had a major impact in the win column. I'll enjoy watching this rotfl.  It's the Patriots you have to do what's told .do it and win . CAM ain't vaxed not surprised he's out
Cam got cut because he sucks not because of the jab
Wonder what Kyle Sloter's rating was, in comparison.....
Not sure why this is a shock to everyone. Mac was the better option and Cam won’t settle for being a backup. Better to cut him now and let another team pick him up while there’s still time in the preseason. Let Denver take him.
Cam ain’t been the same since he won the MVP. Before the MVP he was humble, driven, training to be the best and all the good things associated with great QBs. After the MVP, chasing approval, on social media to much, play to much and haven’t gotten better. Just simple facts
The pats aren’t beating Brady lol 😂
Lakers in 4
I respected skip since first take but Shan
so basically Cam Newtons time in the NFL is over because he chose not to get vaccinated....wild world
The media needs to stop pushing the shots on the people.  It's NOT a vaccine.  They are injections - and they don't protect you from COVID, just like masks don't.  This is ridiculous.  Stop trying to brainwash people into thinking there's anything good about doing either (getting shots or wearing masks).  For those fools who have already done it and those who are going to eventually give in to the pressure, you deserve what you're going to get (short AND long-term), as a result.
I admire Cam Newton more than ever now that I know he refuses an untested, ineffective vaccine that has injured and caused the death of multiple thousands worldwide against a virus that the overwhelming majority of people have at the very least a 99% chance of surviving.  He and Kirk Cousins are smarter than I thought.
Watch no team pick him up, welcome to the CFL Cam Newton. We’d welcome him with open arms
Experimental vaccine.
Cam come on home to atl or daks backup. But if I had my wish the titans, tannehill is good but not cam, close but not cam
Cam didn’t want to be a backup.
Now they’re shaming players for not getting the vaccine 💉🤦🏾‍♂️ Stand on what u believe Cam your life comes before football 💪🏾
Come over to the Buccs Cam, Brady will mentor you into the BILLY GOAT 🐐 ... 😂😂😂 they did you wrong !!!
What happens In the middle of the season if the vaxed players catch C19 because at this point both vaxed and unvaxed are getting C19 at the same rate🤷🏻‍♂️
This covid foolishness is nonsense. It makes chaos and confusion but there is an agenda behind it.  Hunger kills more than covid, Pastor John MacArthur " covid has a 99% survival rate." I know we ALL face death the important thing is your relationship to God. The righteous are always mindful of this life ending.   But fools....as proverbs says, believe anything.
Being vaccinated in the NFL is now a competitive advantage.  The writing was on the wall but Cam could have helped himself. Which team now going to take a risk on an unvaccinated free agent. Cam brings too much unnecessary baggage.
Anyone gonna confirm whether this was due to Cam not getting vaccinated or not? I don't think it was about Mac Jones have "perfect pedigree" which some weirdos like to say about "certain" QBs...You can't have Covid issues and be a wild card to cost the team games on a Bill B team...  But now they will hype a rookie's preseason stats to make it feel good and right...ah well. on Cam...might be done or land somewhere like Houston if Watson is still in the twilight zone...
Cam to Texans?
Wish my Jets would pick him up but we don’t believe in winning soooo yeah. Texans, Redskins & Steelers could use a QB.
look the nfl shouldnt force the vaccine but Jones is consistent
I find it funny how people say it’s no racism but black qbs get one chance even after being a mvp Justin fields is better then dalton and Mac Jones but he’s on the bench because he’s black sad but true
Patriots got a thing for flabby white qbs...
Cam you a free agent tho ! Just like the kid at his football camp said lmfao
I know cam done made a lot of money in the league so far but my brother these QB contracts ain’t the same as they were when you last got a big deal. Don’t let the money train pass you by. You still got talent in you!
What will be said when vaccinated players also catch covid that’s the true question
Cannot believe you guys are using the vaccine is another reason! The guy already had COVID!!!
BeliChick is a RACIST and a CHEATER
The vaccine doesnt work you clowns
No way was Cam ever more than interim. He's lucky Wild Bill didn't stick him at TE. He'll go to Houston if they HAVE to & CAN unload Watson. Cam's lucky anyone wants him at all. He is better than 32 QBs. He's 31st. But the 32nd-42 are up & comers. I'd take Fitzpatrick over Cam. But his old HC already did.
Not shocked giving where he was at. Cam still has talent and will picked up by another team. Good luck.
Talk about promoting the vaccine ,     Relax Shanon everyone has a choice respect his choice .
Cam got cut because he would not get a shot stop beating around the bush lol the NFL is only good for  is gambling now boring ...Booooooooooooooooo
Mac is "Brady-smart"..... Belichick see's Mac as Brady II. Cam is a bridge... to Mac.
Maybe Cam can go back to Carolina
Maybe Washington will get Cam 🤷🏼‍♂️
The laughable horn intriguingly glow because bomber potentially travel midst a craven client. discreet, nervous slope
This will backfire on the Patriots I’m calling it now. Mac won’t give them the best chance to win this season he is a good player but this was a bad decision cutting Cam Newton.
Mac gone be a bust
I'm sad mane cam is the reason I watch football
Last year was Cam's Keeping my job year Belichick likes veterans but Cam still thinking it College ten years into The Not For Long League.
😯
Ryan Tannehill  from T.N was vaccinated and still tested positive for covid,  along with several coaches and other players
Cam Newton didn’t take the COVID-19 vaccine
In sports if the two talents are close you go with the younger guys. Always been like that.
Why cut this guy so late where he stands no chance of starting for any other team?  So Mac Jones is better than Cam right now?  So Jines can't sit a minute to   get a bit more seasoned and more practice reps??  Amazing....make every excuse to start this guy over Cam....they even even mentioned how well he looked during a SCRIMMAHE with the Giants!!!
IThe only thing that really irritates me, is the fact that people are using this vaccine as tool to control everything. People keep trying to think that this vaccine is a cure. That if you get the vaccine you won't get it. THAT IS NOT WHAT A VACCINE DOES! The fact that Cam has already got COVID, he has just as much of a immune response to it as if he got the vaccine. The vaccine DOES NOT keep you from getting COVID! It DOES NOT keep you from passing it. Yet it keeps being utilized as a tool to control and discriminate against people.
its a cruel world
Bill betta hope he play good..I feel another bad season
I'm shocked 😲
So the vaccine is a factor for this man not to have a job 😭😭. Ridiculous
Come to Detroit Cam you can run the whole show, trade Goff for a good receiver and the lions would be good.
They got to be getting marketing money from pro football focus...
RATE MY FANTASY TEAM‼️  Starters Josh Allen Nick Chubb Jonathan Taylor  Adam Thielen  Tyler Lockett Logan Thomas James Robinson 49ers defense  Greg the leg  Bench Lenny Fournette Michael Gallup Tom Brady Mecole Hardman Robert Tonyan Gus Edwards  Cardinals defense
When they start losing don't start talking about all day in a restarting stages. Because you had Cam Newton and you let him go for something that could be overlooked.smh
They are stating the vaccine is the tie breaker. Lol..
this was obvious
It's frustrating when players can't follow simple instructions, what's even MORE frustrating is when veterans players, with diminishing skills can't follow instructions..
EVERYONE MUST TAKE THE TRUMP VACCINES
Even with the vaccine you can get Covid !!!!!! Stop this bullsh*t
Cam to Dallas would be interesting
People...this is preseason....stats will be high. why our black QBs. Should always prove themselves  80 % of the time when these white QBs just have gold thrown in their laps. No analyists will touch this issue with a ten foot pole. Y'all know when Kem showed up in New England..the FANS DID NOT WANT A BLACK QB. Tell me I am wrong on this last issue.
Cam to Dallas please 🙏
He is the epitomy of todays black man that these guys cant say....lazy...self centered...sense of entitlement...defiant..hip hop raised...
Another Great White Hype movie!!!!!
The only starting defense Mack played against was the Giants. You can't compare that to Cam. This was done for 2 reasons. 1 Cam and the vaccination. 2 Mack is good enough and ready to start. Other then that...Mack is not better then Cam.
This is absolutely the dumbest move Belidick has made in 25years....Matt Jones is not ready for the league period!
I would of kept Cam Newton for back up instead of Hoyer
Clown Newton should join WWE.
I’m convinced this is Shannon’s vocabulary: 🤣   "Skiiiiiiup"
Give him to Atlanta we’ll take him !
Let’s be honest with saying what Cam always was to the Patriots - he was a big-name rental used to sell tickets and merch while waiting to draft “their guy.” Let’s be honest about vaccines too- they don’t last forever- with the need for boosters rising we’re going to see cases in vaccinated athletes this fall and winter. Nothing lasts forever- Cam with the Patriots, or the efficacy of this type of medical treatment.
Why Cam wanted to go to the Patriots in the first place. That organization seems too racist to really embrace him.
Nobody doin the DAB😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Vaccinated people get covid as well
Vaccination doesn't equal immunity, just means if you get it or get it again you'll have little to no severe symptoms and you're less likely to die to die, I think we need to look at his lifestyle more so than if he should get vaccinated or not  It seems like people that get the vaccination many of them act like they're bulletproof now and now and they just go back to unhealthy habits, IMO
Go get the Vaccine when the Vaccine doesn’t work huh?
I like Cam Newton but he brought it on himself by not getting vaccinated. I just don't understand it.
Tom Brady lasted a hundred years in New England. Tom Brady lasted that long because he wasn't that guy.
Bro Bill not a haha sure I'll keep you typa guy, other dude practiced better, cam wasn't even showing up, like skip and Shannon say it's a what have you done for me business not a what have you accomplished in your career business
Cant wait till brady retires and skip starts talking about Mac jones and saying his full name 😭
Being vaccinated doesnt make it less likely you can contract covid.
he hasn't even played a game yet
Politrics at its finest, y'all want y'all all white quarterback league back. Brothas slandering Brothas. He started off real and faded fast. Your grandparents would be ashamed.
There will be a lot of questions as to why Cam was released. Not being vaccinated has to be near the top. The risk is too big. You don’t want your starting QB missing games or causing other players to miss due to contract tracing.
Black racist...
this might be a forced retirement for cam
So the vaccine eliminates the chances of getting COViD?
So it’s about the vaccine?  🤔
Entertainment. Two clowns; one clown lies, the other tells the truth.
Nah they were tired of Cam.
Cam > mac
Cam had covid last year and missed some time because of it. IF.........He was tested and doctors tell him he has a high antibody count which will provide the same if not better immunity than vaccine than it makes sense why Cam wouldn't get vaccinated. Shannon and Skip are making the wrong argument, Mac Jones has played better with limited snaps and Belichick feels he deserves the starting role period!!!!!
Cam you can come to Atlanta. Matt Ryan sucks 💯
@1:23 vaccine propaganda
Keep your supposed vaccine!!
As a Saints fan I'm furious... I'd love to have Cam... With all the qbs wanting to move this year we are stuck with Jameis Winston. Yes Winston will do ok... But trust me we used to see them both twice a year. I'd much rather have Cam
You're a fool, if you gamble on any NFL game this year.  The "Covid" fact, will handicap all odds.  You've been warned.
Why can't it just be that the kid beat him out and that's why he lost his job why they keep making it about him being unvaccinated. Vaccinated quarterbacks have gotten covid, so they can miss games too so why is it always about unvaccinated players might miss games?
It’s ok Cam come back up the GOAT in TB and get a ring then be the bridge between Brady and the Buccs’ future QB🤷🏽‍♂️
the one smart enough not to take expieremental gene therapy?
I feel they got to excited over mac Jones,  its still early .
Well this surprised me
Theory: Mac Jone was out of shape on draft night to deter other teams from taking him.
The Patriots is not even making the Playoffs, they're be the bulls post 1998 of the NFL
If Mac gets injured then what 👀 I think that was a dumb decision 🤦🏾‍♂️
He’s older, stuck in his ways and Black... he never stood a chance
Let's go Mac get us back to the top💙❤️
Let's be real man this ain't all about dancing rap songs this about getting the Patriots organization good and I believe Jones can do it
The vaccine isn't proven to be safe it's dumb to get it
Skip “the kid” Bayless
For the millionth time the vaccine doesn’t prevent you from getting covid.  So this argument is irrelevant.
Who cares he’s sucked. And let’s be honest cam isn’t a starter anymore. It just sucks he hasn’t realized that yet.
The patriots releasing Cam Newton is a prime example of white privilege. The patriots are a racist organization (sorry this comment wasn’t intended to be taken seriously it’s just a joke)
Just for the record  man,  people  who are vaccinated can still spread COVID16 to others .
Come on to the A Cam
Cam newton days are over. He can be a good nfl qb without going to the playoffs but he’s not strategic enough to take teams to the superbowl like brady consistently does!
No jenny😔
Release Kirk Cousins and sign Cam Newton. Please Vikings!!
Cams has always been a bum
just when i thought week 4 couldn't get any better. this is so good. can't wait!!! LFG
Cam....not good enough to start and too good? To backup?  His name is too big to be a backup.....i guess.
They dont want a black qb in Boston its a racist city😆😆😆
I actually think that Cam wanted out of New England. I don’t think that he really wanted to play for them. Look for Cam to get vaccinated and be playing for another team. Albeit possibly as a backup
The fact that Cam is going backwards in his career and Cam spelled backwards is _____ 😅 I hate this
People with the vaccine are testing positive as well though..
Cam bout to go to Vikings, Atlanta or Saints Watch
Well let's get ready for another pitiful year..
Can we stop pretending that the aging running quarterback wasn’t going to get hurt?
If you look at everything, the decision was not really that hard — the new guy is going to have to learn under fire eventually, might as well be now. Cam still has some skills but he’s only going downhill from here, just like we all do at some point. But he’ll start someplace, if not right away then when somebody gets hurt or messes up badly.
Cam was vaccinated FOOLS. He already had COVID. It’s called natural immunity. Better than vaccinated. Don’t get lost. Bill didn’t vibe with him. Now Ron Rivera gets his mvp.
Cam should've never gone to the Pats in the first place.  Too many changes needed on both sides in order to have a top tier team.
Skip was surprisingly non gloaty, he said weeks ago he had a feeling mac would start day one
Vaccine was never a factor
Can may never play in NFL again!!!!!! I think Cam has other business interests, he'll be fine. I think Belicheck was only coach Cam would conform to. But, Can't arrogance won't allow him to be Teddy Bridgewater or Jacoby Brissett. Cam will have a podcast airing some time this year, watch!
Bill is smarter than everyone in the comments
No surprise to me .Mac better QB
Fucken libtards
Tbh other teams do need a quarterback like cam it's sad because I'm A patriots fan, but the saints need a quarterback, panthers, titans need a better one, the giants, like he has other chances
It's not a vaccine and it's more dangerous than Covid.
Tuck rule says F the pats
Cam's days were numbered the minute the Pats drafted Jones.
I knew he was going to get CUT but damn but  NOT this EARLY
Skip Bayless does not look healthy.  He looks like he needs to move into a retirement home.  I love watching him but age is catching up to him.  Hang in their SKIP!
Cam's going to Washington!
I think Cam made the correct decision under the circumstances. Very smart kudos to cam !!
Im fking sad
Thank god for Cam Newton and his courage to say no to to peer pressure and the nonsense we have been experiencing the last few years.
Wow...im completely shocked but why not just keep him on for that veteran insight and that spread he causes in the defense..i get he was not a backup but money talks and i bet cam woulda stayed for that
Cam still plays?
I knew cam was gonna get replace either in the preseason or when the season. I'm not surprised. I knew the rookie was gonna play this season. No way they let him sit on the shelf for cam
The shots dont stop you from getting it. So if a person has both shots and still gets covid what will happen then Shannon Skip and everyone else who feels these jabs work?
I know the type of offense they’re trying to transition to. Heavy run and heavy play action. Not score many points but have a strong defense. Very few big plays. Maybe it can work in today’s nfl I but I guess we’ll have to see.
Shannon is such a simp sometimes wake up you can get COVID vaccinated or not 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
I feel bad for cam honestly.
Cam should pick up a mic and become a sports commentator. Fox might be a great platform for him.
Bama QBs are trash in the league Mac won’t be any different
It was the hair. They cut Cam Newton because of his ethnic look.
Nobody talking about how Cam already having had Covid means he doesn't need the vaccine.
Shannon people still getting Covid with the vaccine bruh.
Bengal need to pick him up. I'm not sure how ready Joe really is.
Gotta agree with shannon on this because I told my co-workers that cam not being vaccinated sitting out days and all of that stuff bill doesn't handle distractions very well either you straightened up or you'll be shipped out!!
Cam wont get the jab and kept "forgetting" he needed to get tested before practice. Plus he's not MVP Cam any more. As a wise man once said "Play stupid games, win stupid prizes."
The patriots made their choice and it’s totally sensible   However I’m getting tired of Shannon and skip passing their individual viewpoints on the vaccine.  What these gentleman have picked for their health is their option.  Either way. Nobody should be treated differently either way for their choice.  Same with coverage.   Thanks.
They released him because he chased down the rookie for a high 5
Lol he don't need the vaccine cause he already got covid, it's very unlikely for him to be reinfected
Fuq the whole patriots organization for releasing a veteran qb a week before the season that’s why the Pats can’t win without the goat bums
Skip praising Mac so when the patriots get success under this kid he can say..... "Oh there it is another Brady-esk QB that carried coach BB into greatness." This is Skip making sure he covers all bases on not giving coach BB his due LOL.
Wooooowwww!!! Go to the TITANS!!!
I hate Kyle and John lynch !!! How can they pass up on Mac Jones… idiots
Shannan stay pushing the vaccine. Does'nt he know the vaccinated can pass around the virus?
Let's keep it 💯 people dey cut cam cuz he ain't take jab
Booooooooo
New York giants need to get on it
Cam to the Colts 🤞🏾
people that are vaxxed are getting covid & still get sick.
I'm off that Patriots bandwagon👎👎👎👎
Houston should get him
If Cam is a baller he will backup a qb until his opportunity comes available. If he is a beast he will answer the bell!
Oh Lord, the kid looks good in Preseason and a joint practice and we are ready to crown him?...lol
I was just exposed to someone vaccinated, myself and my team. This is the future now.
Vaaaxx kills
🤔 i dont blame him the 💉 is not what you think people are still getting c19 even with the 💉 so im with cam on this one.
Patriots won’t make the playoffs
Cam is a child of God. Football is secondary.
I'm SHOCKED the Patriots cut Cam, however Mac Jones is a beast! It's nice seeing the lovely Alex on the show too!
In a few years all of you morons who took that "Vaccine" are gonna be on commercials stating "Did you or a loved one die as a result of taking the Covid Vaccine? Call me attorney at law".
SJW’s: “tHiS wAs A rAciSt mOve”.
The patriots want to go back to the super bowl!  Cam Newton wasn't getting it done!
What happened to jenny?!?
Cam played at Auburn
These two are clearly what represents embarrassment if dumbassery
You can still get covid with vaccine stupid
What's not said but probably whispered in league front offices is no one will sign him unless he gets vaccinated!
He never wanted cam clown
Except for his MVP season, Cam’s had a pretty underwhelming pro career
Dallas sign Cam just incase Dak get's hurt!
Pre season lol
What teams dont require players to get the vaccine? Thats where I would go.
Shannon wrong again. What else is new
The vaccine don't stop covid
i wanna see cam either on the colts or washington. washington would be ideal though
To be honest I don't really trust anyone throwing the football in New England right now. If Brady can't win games for you what is Mac Jones or Cam gonna do for you?
I’m surprised that Cam was released so early. Cam looked good this preseason. I hope to see Cam find a home to where he can excel in this league again. He seems like a good dude. He’s a hardworking great teammate as well. He was genuinely happy for Mac when he threw his first touchdown pass. Thank you Cam for what you’ve done. And hope to see you playing again soon. As a bama and patriot fan, congratulations to Mac Jones!! I hope to see you continue to work hard and be the best you can for the patriots.
Shannon and Skip are so pathetic.  To just say "go get the vaccine" like its a no-brainer shows you how ignorant these fools are. Telling a woman its OK to have an abortion while she 100% kills a human,  but in the same breath saying someone should be vaccinated to protect the team from penalty, or others from a .001% chance of death, is the definition of insanity. If u think a woman has the right to choose what to do to her body, then shut your mouth about mandating a vaccine. He and Skip should mention how Roger Goodell made this mess....nobody else.
Big mistake coach
Cams had covid though... hes less likely to spread covid than anyone in that building. Vaccinated people can still get it and pass it. Cam cant get it but he can still pass it. though probably less than someone whos vaccinated and doesn't know they have it. These rules need to be updated with the science
Cam had his time. He's steady declining..  Can't ball forever! He'll be aight though.
As a patriots fan I'm 100% okay with people losing their jobs for not getting the vaccine. Why risk your team forfeiting games for being uneducated
Not u put the pressure on this guy because if he doesn’t perform well I want all the negative talk like they did Cam last year
New England not A place for Black Qbs. They don’t want em
They’re giving him a chance to hook up with another team
Not surprised.. Newton was a shell of his former self...
Hate seeing Cam get cut, though I'm getting the feeling it's probably a mutual agreement between both parties. If BB told Cam he was going to start Jones and gave Cam a choice to be a backup or go to another team Cam probably wants to try to make it on another team no? Then again the season is going to start soon and there aren't many teams looking to add a starting QB.
Come to WFBT
Knew he was getting cut...
Lebron have y’all running with the KID word .  It’s pretty disrespectful if you ask me .
I’m glad newton thinks outside the box
I think Bill logic is he want revenge on defeating Tom brady.i think he believes Mack Jones has a better chance of defeating Tampa Bay and Tom brady.its bellicheck ego and reputation on the line.not discrimination at all.
He had 5 TD passes going into Week 17. Good bye, sir.
so this is about getting vaccinated or nah?
hilarious they thought a washed up guy who can't throw would start
If you are vaccinated :YOU CAN STILL GET COVID  19!!! Why is this ignorance keep being circulated.   I know people personally who caught covid from people who were vaccinated.
Patriots only winning five games this year
They cut him cuz he didn't want to get the shot. Like you can't COvid even after getting it 🤦‍♂️
Whats up with the vaccine part of this. Im not 100% sure, but aren’t people with the Vaccine still getting covid & getting sick? Im in Texas and they keep telling us more than half the state is Vaccinated but the cases are rising. So couldnt Cam have got the Vaccine & later caught covid & still had to sit out? Or if you get covid but had the vaccine, nobody cares?
This dude lost a job because he wouldn’t get vaccinated lol….how stupid can you be
I’m not surprised
Cam been blackballed. So it's not a surprise.
Typical closet racists in the comments that have to bring race into everything. Bunch of sad degenerates.
It's a VERY smart decision!
Are we going to bring the vaccinated vs unvaccinated thing to sports?? Come on Unc
If that's the case why does no one respect cam's choice... the go along get along gang...weak men
And both can get Covid and both can spread it smfh. Who is doin the thinking these days?!!
Sports center better stop pushing the vaccine which doesn’t even stop you from getting sars-cov-2 anyway
So skip beats shannon in another argument lol
Patriots perfect season...0-17 🤣😂
not surprised at all
It's all about the vaccine
bro what
Cam played himself, should've gotten vaccinated. Put the team and himself at risk, otherwise, Cam woukd be the starter.
Mac Jones must have really impressed Bill B.
Cam going to Tampa or raiders
Sad that “vaccination status” matters in deciding personnel decisions
Cams not vaccinated? OUT! GOOD
Cam Newton got cut because he sucks
Mac Jones ain't it Bill. Patriots miss playoffs 2nd straight yr
How do u go from competing for starting job...to getting released
Anti Vaxxers STAY f-Ing sh*t up for themselves and their families.
Cam and Mac both equal AMC ..   invest in AMC become rich..  it's all a distraction 🚀🚀🚀
My guess came true, that Bellichick wants to pit Mac Jones against Tom Brady and win...
Super Man Cam is dead! Not the same ever since super bowl loss
Well now cam can enjoy not being Vaccinated at home...he can properly social distance
I'm personally rooting for Mac I think it would be such a great story
Skip assumes a lot, and one of those things is that Bill never praised Tom.  I remember him praising Tom even during camp in 2001. Bill gives it out as needed, and this is taken to be a mean streak, but it's meant to psychologically motivate players even if it means they don't like Bill.  He doesn't care about personality contests.
Cam def winding up on WFT.
Cam got Covid, which means he has a better immunity to the Delta than Mac Jones, Jones is just plain better.
🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️I hate it here. Why we actin like vaccinated people cant catch covid n miss games?? N still pass it??🙅🏿‍♂️💉🙅🏿‍♂️💉🙅🏿‍♂️foh
I knew he was gonna get cut when they started complaining about that rap music
People talk about this preseason performance like it wasn’t even set up for Cam to succeed. A big part of what Cam brings is running and you don’t really do that with your QB in preseason. He didn’t get to look as good as he could but hey let’s see if they made the right choice week 1 because Flores and that defense are coming.
Well I see Cam  reunited with Ron Rivera @ Washington they don't have a QB!
these pair of morons promoting the vaccine? if cam got covid he is immune to covid! you guys are ignorants and clowns!
I hope all players that wanted to make a team got them vaccine. Writing is on the wall fellas
Of course the kid has no preseason INTs. He throws the ball 4 to 5 yds down the field 🤣😅😂
You can still get Covid even after getting the vaccine. So if you cut a player for that you’re f@cking  stupid!
No black quarterbacks in New england..  Bengals Cowboys jets miami could use cam
We see why Tom Brady is the man and the coach is a fool I can't wait till he gets his welcome to the NFL moment.
Y'all got to get Skip props because he called it he said that Mac Jones was going to be the starter week 1
Cam sucks I said it all along that  he would be cut before September and I was absolutely correct he can't read defenses.
Yea get a shot that does not work they just wanted to cut him that simple
Skip look old... Now I know he's old but he really looks old think he needs more makeup
Yiu can get covid with the vaccine so what are you really saying
Y’all got tired of seeing Cam in them Pre-game post-game outfits
I truly believe that Cam was told Mac Jones won the starting job and asked out
I can understand the fact that the Patriots are rebuilding and yes Mac had a great preseason. But when those Dolphins 1st team defense rages at Mac, if he goes down, who's his backup? That's the real question here! Who is Mac Jones backup? The Patriots whole season will rest on Mac Jones backup and know ones even brought that situation up. Who is Mac Jones' backup??? And Cam will not come back to help! Period!! Bill has rolled the dice! Good luck!
IF Mac Jones is the real thing then Bellichek is brilliant!
A study has come out saying natural immunity by having covid is better protection than the vaccine. Cam has had the virus. His natural immunity is 13 times better than the vaccine.
Kirk Cousins not vaccinated. NE is in for another rude awakening tough days ahead.
If you had Covid already, like Cam, you already have natural immunity. Natural immunity has the same effect as the vax, only better (no side effects) The Karen Covid police needs to stop, obviously Cam had no problem getting over covid last year, and he's older than most team mates. If all people from the vulnerable group have the vax, they have nothing to fear from young healthy men not being vaxed. Cam was cut because he sucked in preseason, and Mac looked really good.
So Cam doesn't want the vaccine ? I like him even more now . I hope he gets a team .
Lmao, Mac Jones will Bust
So players are frowned upon fa not gettin a vaccine??🤔 Crazy🤦🏾‍♂️
The vaccine thing is irrelevant.. the vaccine doesn’t prevent you from getting the virus or spreading .. the public is terribly misinformed. It’s actually sad how ignorant people are to the vaccine and what it does. The vaccine is Personal protection ONLY on the strength of YOUR immune system. Good grief
It's actually good timing for both parties. Many teams in desperate need of a solid starter.
This show is definitely sponsored by Pfizer . Getting that big pharma money 💰
He should go to the giants
damn
So sad to bad see you later not
When JONES goes down via injury. Guess who's going to be 📞 NE vaccine or not...
You can get COVID even if you're vaccinated ❗
Cam was and could be still a great QB. He was an amazing QB but he’s got a lot of mileage more than most because he ran a lot. Mac Jones is a great QB. Few read and understand a defense like Jones does. Jones broke every QB rating known the year he started at bama. Us bama fans know how great he is. Cam was just as good 11 years ago.
I am surprised that they released him
Cam will not be a backup
Shannon, you're normally smarter than this,  having the vaccination doesn't guarantee you won't contract covid!
Don't know of anyone noticed it's people that are fully vaccinated still catching covid
My man cam 🤦🏼‍♂️Crazy
If you catch it you shouldn't need a vaccine....
chop em up chop em out
When Cam was a free agent before joining the Patriots. I thought the Cowboys would have made a pursuit for him. Right now that he is available again and Dak is having shoulder issues. I think the Cowboys should make Cam an offer.
He gave mac jones 10 games?..8 at the most this season.
Shocking...I like Cam but it became clear that he's no longer the elite QB he was. It become apparent Jones was going to take the job.  Cam can't get rid of that social media bug and it definitely effected the patriots decision.  If you feel strongly that Cam will not be your starter after the first few games this is a good decision for both.
Scam Newton is done.
If Cam Newton had the vaccine and got Covid would he not have to wait two weeks to come back? I couldve sworn i was told that the vaccine lowers the severity of the virus not stop it. You see how ridiculous this all sounds?
Shilling for the vaccine,  you two are a disgrace
Cam just take a BACKUP ROLL PLEASE
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 pre season we go see
Yall should have been known this was coming no black QB will never play in New England
Skip is taking preseason performance to the bank. Does he not watch sports?
Can we leave vaccine talk out of sports Jesus Christ
How old is Cam now?
what the heck is going on with Skip face
They're gonna run the ball more... TBs defense is number 1 in stopping the run for three years straight. Good luck Mac in week 4. Wish that game was here in Tampa, but Tom is playing that game as if it's the super bowl
Cam Newton is just not a great qb anymore.
I didn't expect this to be the first thing I'd hear about the nfl.  I can see why they did it, but I don't think it was the best move.  I don't think Mac Jones will be able to compete on an elite level this year, but then again, he's basically a future prospect for the Patriots.  If he pans out, good on them but I don't think this was the right move.
He should give up football and focus on his modeling career. His outfits and dress up game are better than his game on the field. He's doesn't seem like he really doesn't want to play. He's just doing it just to get by and for the money.
Cowboys better sign him now
Only question is where is he going to play next maybe Houston possibly not alot of starting oppertunitys out there no offense to tyrod taylor but might be best place for him
It would be cool to see Skip and Stephen a go at it again a couple times a week
This is the NFL you need 2 good QBs
Cam is basically the nfls version of Carmelo Anthony.
Giants pass up on mac Jones in the draft
Wow. Cam will always be my dog  because he single handedly beat Alabama in college. I expected more from him in the pros. Yes, he did go to a Superbowl, but I was expecting him to be a top tier QB in the NFL.
Cam already got cv19. So he less likely to get it. Most vaccinated ppl getting sick. shay & skip spreading myth & fear mongering.
Hmm so let’s square this away…. Best to my knowledge unvaccinated players when they miss games they are fined and disciplined BUT since this big Vaccine DOESN’T protect you from getting Covid what happens when vaccinated players have to miss time? Hmm yeah if you don’t see a problem here then you’re the problem 💯
This is in NO WAY "Brady-esque".  Brady was number 199. Mac Jones was #15 and a first rounder. And Mac Jones has done literally NOTHING in the NFL.  Pre-Season doesn't count. Belichick has destroyed the Patriots. Brady is going to outplay his rookie, if the rookie even survives to game 4.
Who df is the new girl
Cam is going to Cowboy backup role to Prescott for NFL minimum veteran salary $800K!
Is my boy getting another gig?
Shannon Sharpe doesn't like a white man winning a job over a black man you can tell just by watching how angry he is
The nature of the business. Shishhh
I’m willing to bet Cam was just pissing off the front office people with the covid vaccine stuff 🤦‍♂️
Shannon tryna make it about the vaccine
it unfortunate that a vaccine or no vaccine could even enter this equation.  theres still a lot of unknowns about the virus, the vaccines, how well our bodies do at managing the disease.  yet, with all the uncertainty around it, we are be compelled to make a decision on it right now!  more or less a mandate, and on a subject where we have barely scratched the surface.  be nice if we could wait and see a little more data happen, and experts research and publish about it, before we start tellin people you "have" to do this or that.
Oh look not getting a Flu shot is causing more ppl their jobs 👀
I think this was all about a vaccine "Scare" advert/story. Cam was going to get cut either way, I bet if he pulled a Aaron Roger showcase they wouldve have to use another declining stater (unvaccinaded). Boooo on you Fox!
Skip: Mac Jones did great in Pre-Season. Browns: We were 4 - 0 in Pre-Season.  Went 0 - 16 in Regular Season.
lefties don't know what to do with their favorite group of people to exploit go against their mandates
Getting vaccinated doesn't prevent you from getting the virus. It should increase your immune system's capacity to fight it if you do contract it post-vaccination. But let's stop with this nonsense of doing your part to get the vaccine to protect other people. You get the vaccine to protect yourself.
what a plandimic.....shannon always pushing the global new world agenda....smh
are we still not understanding how covid works???? the shot doesn't prevent you from getting covid any less!!! you just have a lower chance of  getting as sick and die (which can still happen)....so Jones can also get covid and miss time like every vaxed or unvaxed person!! if you vaxed and get covid you still have to miss time
Patriots is a racist team at the end of the day not surprised by the news he wasnt a good fit for new England anyway come on home to the Falcons cam definitely will take him over matt ryan any day
Cam to New Orleans  that would be a big problem for the NFC
Well Bill got what he wanted, another white qb!!!
Because last year he was completely healthy got Covid for a few days was back why the f*** do you need a vaccine when it's all it's going to be is that
Cam is a scrub, also known as an antivaxer. No Scrub. I would not hire anyone that is an antivaxer.
Yeah I'm sure that Brady never got a high five from Belichick's are you f****** kidding me
I guess mediocre Cam is gonna have to take his clowning antics elsewhere.
Vaccine won’t stop you from getting covid doe.. you can be vaccinated, you get tested positive and you still won’t play.
Skip was right
HaHa I told you guys not to be hating me. The old FIG NEWTON IS ALL DRIED UP!!! The Hall of Shame for you CAM. I LOVE TO BE RIGHT!!!!!
Send cam to the colts please
I salute Cam. Keep your dignity and morals/principles. Bump the vaccine. Doesn’t work anyway 🚮.
Its rumored that Cam hurt Mac's hand after chasing him down for the High five. Bill took it as Cam was trying to sabotage the rookie.
Being vaccinated doesn't prevent u from contracting Covid. The vaccine potentially helps keep the symptoms  from being severe or fatal... sick of this show pushing this false narrative, Mike Vrabel is fully vaccinated and still got covid. Did he not put his team at risk??
Feel sorry fr cam but he never recoverd from that super bowl loss IMO
Running the ball heavily against an all-time great run defense.  Interesting.
They’re making this about the vaccine? Damn. I thought this was fox sports.
Yea let's bring up vaccinations of all things, f ing stupid ,I hope all the talent leaves the nfl after them being forced to get the covid vax,
If you got beat out by a rookie who has your name spelt backwards….it’s a sign that you need to hang up the cleats.
Funny thing about the vaccine even if you’re vaccinated you can still contract the c19 and spread it
Cam to the Saints or Titans
I Already Knew It Wuz Gonna Happen When A Few Days Ago..Mac Answer A Question And The First Person He Mentioned Wuz Hoyer Not Cam...Cam Only Played Two Series...It's All About Politics
Just call the NFL to CDC all those m************ are stupid and don't know what they're talking about anyway
Cam Newton = Carmelo Anthony
Sometimes in life we can get in the way of our own success.
I’m a Green-bay Fan But I’m a Mac Jones fan too. Might get a Jersey.
They do ball players like cars .. when you get old and a lot of miles they go buy a new one..
Im not even a Patriots fan but once Mac started slipping through the draft boards a little bit and was projected to possibly be picked by New England I was hype! Love seeing the next generation of kids starting their legacy. I think hes gonna light it up for you patriots fans for a decade+, congrats NE
Good for him not taking the "vaccine"
Patriots will continue losing.  The football Gods won't allow them to win now
F that vaccine.  God for cam, ER these idiots experiment on u two kno it alls.
Cam was putting the entire team at risk by not getting vaccinated. This is a really good team. You can't jeopardize the team for 1 player 😂. Cam shot himself in the foot.
I'm confused bc last I heard even if vaccinated you can still catch COVID-19 and if u do catch it u still have to sit out 14 days either way....soooo u cut him bc of his right to not get vaccinated???
I respect Cam's decision not to get jabbed, don't be a guinea pig for uncertainty. To this day, it hasn't proven effective or otherwise. If he doesn't get another opportunity, enjoy life, children, etc.
😔
Skip was waiting for this one🤣🤣🤣
The vac ain’t gone stop you from getting or spreading the virus they just dnt like cam and want the rookie
Jones was just better and younger that's it.
Here’s how I see it: if the rookie is playing as good as or better than the veteran you’ve got issues.
just wishing he could come to Florida State 😁
Stop it with the vaccine, Shannon.  You are WAYYYYY outta line.  Time will prove Cam...who HAS had Covid...and his system is BETTER than those receiving these "still questionable" shots... Cam made right decision on Covid experimental shots for "him".  And, conversely, Belichick made wrong decision on choosing Jones at this juncture over Cam. Bet---New England will lose noticeable games this year they should've WOULD'VE won with Cam.  They will not make the play-offs. Hoyer will see plenty of action.
I don't think BB cares if he beats TB12, no one is bitter about him leaving, clearly TB had more talent than the Pats last year and was the right place for TB12 to be in is final seasons.
They will win 7 games at most.
Cam listens to rap music
Remeber that kid that called out cam at camp and said he was gon be poor  He is laughing right now
Congrats and good luck to Mac Jones. Cam will bounce back just needs to remain positive.
Real black people are to much of a distraction for real white people. Cam got to comfortable
Lolol Sharpe called it
Surprised it was a cut and not a trade
Cam Newton might be heading to Washington! Or Houston if they let go of Watson
I find it ironic that he lost his job to a guy that has his name spelled backwards
The fact of the matter is that the patriots operate their team a certain way and cam was not a good fit. They like guys that come in, get the job done, play a team role, and don’t have ego. Any talk of him being cut because of being unvaccinated or black is silly. The reason he got cut is because he’s not built for the patriot way and them starting him this year does nothing to improve their team for the future.
Mac Jones is gonna be a star, great accuracy and decision making
Cam going to be the next nick foles to lead someone to a super bowl when they starter get injured b4 the playoffs
Love Cam but he a clown 🤡,he do to much!!!!Now he can wear all the hats he wants😤😒😩
This kid is everything belichick wanted and he’s white .. 😂 come on. Nobody can say they didn’t see this one coming unfortunately. Yes the Covid stuff and performance play an issue. But let’s b honest. Who does New England prefer as the face of their franchise?
If you had COVID previously you’re more protected than if you get the vaccine. In a way, he is more protected.
I'm wondering what Tom Bradys winning % against rookie quarterbacks is.    LOL chalk that up as a win for the Buccaneers.        LOL
Cam to the Colts???
Cam come back home to A town stop playing cam!!
But everyone getting vaccinated keeps getting sick.. I don't understand why they force it on people
Crazy how the media can affect decisions like these to happen
Alex Curry is just brunette Jenny Taft. Fox Sports has a type 🤣
This has more to do with Cam not being vaccinated.  People who are not vaccinated cause more risk, are more unreliable, etc.  Employers, bosses, managers, etc do not want unreliable people.  And NO TEAM will sign Cam when he's not vaccinated.  End of story.
I’m still not getting an experimental vaccine
BLACKS WE ARE GOD CHOSEN PEOPLE THE REAL HEBREW ISRAELITES OF THE BIBLE RESEARCH ...
It’s partly a financial decision.  Now they don’t have to pay him any guaranteed money.  Personally, I would have kept Cam for goal line packages and short yardage situations.
Miami pick him up 🐬patriots BELICHICK trash organization no loyalty
If it’s about players getting the shot, maybe you should ONLY sign players that have gotten the shot.
I remember a game in Carolina when Derek Anderson, the backup, was just tearing it up, Carolina was rolling. Cam Newton, at the beginning of the second half, comes running into the huddle, even though he was injured. The announcers, of course, talked about Cam's loyalty and dedication to the team, but I saw a narcissist who wanted to make sure he didn't get upstaged. I suspect that that kind of attitude alienates enough players that he never develops a cohesive team, and always comes up a little short.
Wth we goin off preseason # s to make somebody starter??  Wtf when we do dat
Getting vaccinated does not stop you from catching COVID! It only stops you from dying
Wait did Cam just get cut over a vaccine? lol
Vaccinated ppl are spreading virus plus have worse symptoms when they get variant. your cdc that y'all follow said these stats. yall straight fools.
Lol the vaccine part is total bs because you can still catch covid and miss 14 days regardless
*SUPRISING BUT CAM YOU DON'T GET VACCINATED, YOU POST CRYPTIC MESSAGES ABOUT LOYALTY, THAT DOSENT WORK LIKE THAT IN NEW ENGLAND!!!*
No mention of QB's Curt Cousins and Carson Wentz not being vaccinated, just continue to down talk Cam Newton 🤔
NFL should not test for the Sweet and Sour Sniffles.
Maybe the Camster can wind up on America’s Team?  Now that would be a match made in heaven. Lol! 😂
Stop D riding this kid who has played with the best recruiting classes for the past 3 years and hasn't done anything thing in this league., and when he starts to fell I dont want to hear it's his first year I want that same energy you all are having now.....
Belichek never wanted a black qb PERIOD.. ok, y'all have fun with that
The Pat's STOLE Mac. Get ready for Pat's Dynasty 2.0. He's the most pro ready QB coming out of college. He can't run just like Brady. However, he thinks just like Brady. That's more important in the NFL. Hasn't the rest of the league figured that out yet? Apparently not. It looks like Alabama is N.E.'s Triple A affiliate and they just sent up their ace pitcher. Lmao. I still believe Mac's poor pro day was staged by Belichick.... so nobody would draft him before N.E. at #15. Steal of the century....
I just wonder if Coach wasn't tired of hearing all the debate and just decided, "You know what? Mac's starting. That'll shut people up." But it's gotta be more than that. That would make sense if it was just Cam being back-up and Mac starting. For them to drop Cam completely, the vaccine decision had to be a part of it.
Cam Newton had covid. He has the antibodies to the virus that will last the rest of his life. He doesn't need the vaccine. Whether or not he has been vaccinated is nobody's business but his.
Exciting
Saints, Titans or Falcons. That's where I wanna see Cam💯🤷🏾‍♂
Skip has the ugliest shirt I’ve seen in a long time!
Skip and Shannon: UNDISPUTED SHEEP 🐑
It was only a matter of time before Cam was benched for Mac or released. Im still surprised to see it happen right now. I know Mac outplayed him in practice and preseason games, but you still havent seen Mac up against real, game-time defenses scheming and getting tricky. Cam may not be the most talented guy out there, but he can still help when it comes to breaking down those looks. This move was expected, but the timing was not
I hope Bill doesn't ruin this kid... He's clearly not the genius I thought he was without Brady. With this move, Bill is on the hot seat... If he Trubiskys this kid, he's done.
Cam is coming back to Carolina
Any day without Jenny is a beautiful day.
Cam already has covid he doesn't need the vaxx nor does anybody honestly this is Medical apartheid and is literally illegal.  Cam should sue for discrimination.
It’s crazy man, he went from being the face of the league to being cut
Man stop trying to shame players for not getting a vaccine. It's their choice and nobody has the right to coerce them one way or the other
This is the difference between a winning team and a mediocre team. No divas ahead of the team. Someone ring the Cowboys and show them how a team is supposed to be managed
Wow. Goes to show you media cant predict the future
Damn Cam turning into the Carmelo Anthony of the NFL except he has a Superbowl appearance and MVP.I hope he can bounce back like melo did.
How he came from bein tha starter to cut
Anyone going to tell these guys that the vaccine doesn’t stop you AT ALL from getting Covid. Doesn’t stop you from spreading either. Just keeps you out of the hospital and the ground. Period
Oh no Cam gone.  What did they have in Carolina, nothing and they still got rid of him.  Should have knew then.
😱
Sad to say but Cam is washed…he had his chance last season to prove he still had some gas in the tank & he was trash. The NFL is full of new up & coming QB’s that teams are going to build upon for a brighter future. I think the pats made the right move. Rebuild & start fresh. Can’t start new with an old washed up QB
Wow. Shocked at the timing.. not shocked at the behavior.  Belichek is ruthless. Great for winning.  Bad for relationships in the long run.
Did We See This Coming??? Maybe,  But,If A SIX-TIME SUPER BOWL QB****Delivers Championships To This Organization..And He Is Gone, What Do We Think, But, Cam Needs To Understand, With U Being Vaccinated, U Are Lowering The Risks..Of Exposing YourSelf, The Team, Games Being Cancelled..We Have Choices In This Life…
Cam Newton to Washington Football Team 🏈 is the logical choice
This sucks, because I was looking forward to hating on him all season. Hopefully he lands somewhere else.
MISTAKE... Pats will regret this mistake this year...
What happens if MAC gets hurt? I'm just saying I think cam as a backup would be good insurance even if he's a little disgruntled.
Did you really just throw in another jab about him not being vaccinated? 🤦‍♂️
Cam didn’t fit the patriots mode/mold he just look out of place
Shannon always gets surprised every time a black player gets cutt then blames the white coaches or something rathe r
At this point cam Newton is just a name. He’s been on the decline every since the Super Bowl loss
Bill is out of his mind! Wait and see Mac vs. real NFL pros. I bet he will cry.
Oh boo hoo so sad, a washed up qb gets cut cry me a river.
Maybe not everyone wants to be a lab rat!!!!!
Team first  Get vaccinated Cam did it to herself.
Will the NFL pay the players when they start having major issues from the jab?
not surprised cam is washed
Waiting for woke ESPN to use the "white privilidge" card on this.
Tom Brady left new England I didn’t skip a beat 😂😂
Whatever bill says , the opposite will happen
Can't knock Cam for not wanting to get vaccinated, but I also can't knock Bill for going with the vaccinated qb. Too many restrictions to be jeopardizing the season.
Stand your ground Cam! Much respect! We know why they cut  you, because of the Jab!
crazy to think cam would be the starter week 1….this took a sharp left turn.
He's almost done for his career!
No playoffs for the Patriots this year . With Cam cut Jones ain't taking them to the playoffs
If bill doesn’t get this team to at least the playoffs… this will forever haunt his career. You couldn’t win without Brady and you cut cam. The what if’s will trump the rookies skill to play
Alot of pressure on Mac Jones now..🤔
Is skip dead? He looks just like The Tallest stupidest Monstar from Space Jam.
Cam Newton needs to take a year or two off to fix up his passing and decision making. Like he needs a long qb camp.
The amount of holes in the vaccination logic is astounding to me. Like it's stuff that doesn't take long to find. None of these vaccines prevent you from catching COVID. It's still unclear how long each vaccination remains "effective". It's still unclear if there are long term side effects. These shots technically aren't even vaccines if you look at what a real vaccine actually is. So if it doesn't prevent you from getting COVID or stop you from spreading it, why are you taking it? Go outside, exercise, and hope you catch it so you'll have the antibodies if you want to be "vaccinated" so badly. Otherwise, continue with your normal routine. This entire thing was handled so poorly.
People are actually surprised ? Cam has not been the same since Von Miller took his soul in that Superbowl. And even before that 2015 season he has been average. Throw in the fact that he is a huge Ego and does not get the vaccine this was an easy decision for BB
Cam needs to sign with Tampa bay as backup. Once Tampa up by 40. Let cam in and have him run a play into the pats sideline and crush Bellicheck
Ron Rivera left Cam almost 2 yrs. ago? What's not to comprehend? It's not nuclear biophysics. Most people don't know what they want. Someone has to step in and make the decision for them. Belichick did just that.
But BumAssBridgewater & Daniel Jones are starters. Make it Make sense.
Y they actn like vaccinated ppl dont get/spread covid is my only question 🤔
7-10..
So what happens when the vaccinated dude gets sick? You lose him for 14 days too, correct?
Cam to Miami would be lovely
vaccine status makes no sense if everyone else is vaccinated...
Yo is this racist or am I trippin
Cam had the virus, doesn'r need the vaccine. Shannon is an Idiot making that an issue.
I’m not a Cam guy but I’m with him on this. You can’t get covid twice. So why get a vax that’s doesn’t really protect you?  Hang in there Cam
The vaccine takes away the natural antibodies,  so the likelyhood of covid infection is higher with the vaccine
Mac Jones 🎆
Its so funny that people are saying this is because of racism
Cam should look at Washington Football, Philly, Houston (depending on deshaun), Denver.
He would wait the same amount of time if he catches covid vaccinated/unvaccinated. Ask Lamar Jackson who is vaccinated
I said this when it 1st happened BOM was trying to get a superstar coach and steel filled stop pushing black is a pushing black quarterbacks
Good. BILL gets BIG Thanks for saving CAM after the way CHARL. handled Him(though that 🚪 swung both ways), but CAM HAS OPTIONS. Teams NEED Starting QBs.
Can should go to Pittsburgh and wait on Big Ben to fall apart.
Cam threw 21 times and Mac Jones 51 times. The media start driving the train on draft day. I still believe Cam sold out in Super Bowl and it was all down hill from that day.
Hope he gets signed by another team. I heard Bishop Sycamore is a good option
Bucs beat pat bucs beat Patriots   fourth game of the season
They're giving Cam a chance to get on another team before the rosters are finalized.
He's going to the Texans
Smh... why are they bringing up being vaccinated the first is not being vaccinated. Last time I check players that are vaccinated can still catch covid. I doubt covid had anything to do with bilichek decision
Thank you Cam. Although I’m still bitter about November 26th, 2010 from the Iron Bowl, much respect!! Roll Tide!
Shannon is on there just to you say yes to everything skip says😅 skip lets him have a little fun when it comes to LeBron
Why aren’t the HIPPPA laws protecting the players?  This is getting out of hand, with all this jab talk.
That shouldn't even be a factor for the FACT that you can still catch and are more likely to be a super spreader if you are vaccinated (because you more than likely won't have any symptoms and wouldn't even know you're affected)
I hope the worst for the Patriots.
Patriots vs Dolphins gonna be 🔥🔥🔥
😂 I swear they was both just riding with Cam yesterday
Cam wants to be a tight pant, funny hat designer.... not a football player!
Last year people were saying “you don’t sign cam to be a backup”   Cam is gonna be signed to be a backup.
Surprise? Cam his Whole career had been the dictionary's example of systemic racisms. Lets get real. The bots might attack this statement, the truth is a*****
Mac Jones played in the SEC in a pro style system and conference. U knew what you had in Cam. Jury still out on Mac but, Tim will tell.
Shannon shut up about the vaccine dog . Football is temporary , the vaccine gone be in you FOREVER and not everyone’s system/body  has positively received it . STOP trying to use this as a way to push the vaccine . You keep saying “ ITS HIS CHOICE” but yet at the same time throwing shade for him not getting it . Big goofy bro
To show you how bad Cam has fallen the Cowboys would rather rock the backup with Cooper Rush.  yikes
This is why Belichick is the best NFL coach in history. He makes tough decisions with ease and confidence . His players and WELL prepared and confident to execute the weekly plan to beat your opponent . In 3 yrs he will contend for another SB.
Bill B. Made the right movie because he could not count on cam with him not wanting to get vaccine and plus he wanted to play his first round pick at quarterback.
Mistake
Its Boston??
NFL needs to actually follow the science- Natural immunity far exceeds vaccine induced anti-bodies. If a guy had covid already, NFL should consider him vaxxed.
He needs to get the vaccine if he wants to play in the NFL
Shannon was really passionate about the vaccine story lol
vaccination will not prevent you from getting an infection.
of course natural immunity from having had covid already is showing to be superior to the vaccine immunity.  Wait till all these vaccinated players come up positive.  Then what?  I hope not, but many vaccinated are getting delta.
Since Cam already had covid... why does he need to get vaccinated? Make it make sense.
Cam will never start for a football 🏈 team , but as a backup quarterback unless his agent negotiate with the Texans if they trade DeShawn. Hope Cam fashion modeling career will be better than his football 🏈 career.
I think cam will go to Washington Or Houston
Let’s face it, Cam made the roster, but most likely they had asked him to be a backup. Cam must’ve declined to a backup role
Mac Jones better be good or bill belichick will look like an idiot again lol
Cam is one of the most overrated qbs in the nfl
Might be a fit to take over from Big Ben or Houston
cam newton about to destroy  the league when he gets the opportunity
😠 I don't like how Now they are making every sports & News outlet  Promote this Vaccine.... We should have a choice, this is 🇺🇸 right?
Whoa 🤯
Mac Jones isn't going to do anything. F the patriots, their dynasty ended with Tom.
Why no one talking about wentz not being vaccinated. All I here about is Cam
I never saw cam lastin wit the pats anyway hope he get a Chance to show what a freak of nature he is
A black man always gotta be perfect.😐😓
Might be it for Cam as a starter. Teams are wary of unvaccinated individuals in general, especially QBs and I'm not sure Cam wants to be a backup.   Then again, I'm sure desperation as a result of mid-season injuries could change that equation.
u still can spread covid if youre vaccinated..why they acting like vaccinated ppl cant pass covid..all the vaccine does is make you asymptomatic..but u still can spread it the vaccine does not stop trasmission of the virus..thats why they insist on ppl wearing the mask..so im confused
Covid has nothing to do with it.
How about the Vikings or Giants taking Cam?
Shannon sharpe is racist
When the game speeds up , on the real game this dude is going to fold up like a tent.
Cam is trash good move
Cam victum of circumstances... Tom left and one a ring bill in panic mode
Cam should go to Houston ! and get a massage !
A player without any obvious health reasons not to get vaccinated for his country, community and team, gets cut by a coach that believes that no ONE player is greater than the team. I'm shocked!
It's messed up if he got cut just because he wasn't vaxxed. You shouldn't be forced to take it if you don't feel comfortable about it. Damn be a "team player"
Wait til them big dawgs get in there with that pressure.. i feel sorry for the back up
The vaccine, the rap music etc....we knew Patriots fans prefer a White QB.
Well, I'm sorry at this point Cam is a backup quarterback now and unvax. So it's on him what happens next
Washington Could Use a QB cause Ryan Fitzpatrick will not have anything Guaranteed or the Jets
Cam has always been overrated. Even in the height of his success. The shelf life for these mobile QBs isn't as long. He's 32 and on his way out. He is done. Unless he agrees to be a backup.
A Shannon sometimes I questioned your loyalty as truth or what the  masses do about the vaccine…you say you from the country but sometimes it seems suspect with your answers to some questions 🤔🧐🤔
Vaccine is not FDA approved also America's been using MELANIN folks as a pawn in this medical business since forever just to figure out what works... CAM made the right choice..WAKE UP PPL
The Vax doesn't stop people from getting anything society has to stop with the false narrative
Cam Newton is more of a CFL type QB. He sucks
It's about the vac shot.. and forfeit games cam made is easy for Bill and NE on the low...wins losses and money..it's a business
I’m not surprised..I watched the  games And cam was out performed. Mac Jones looked like he’s been playing in that offence all his life.
Are they once again using a Black man as the face of "Making an example out of you?" Kap and Eric were 1st. Then again....It is Boston so..... They Harassed Kyrie for 2 years then acted outraged and shocked why someone would leave....
Belicheck dont look like a guy that like black people..he wants you to shut up.. he wants you to be your remote control and Calls it the Patriots way..
Shannon would do anything for money plain as day now you keep trying to get cam to put thatshut in his body when he doesn't have to just because you let the media and silly head ppl in the public that's sheep anyways sway you to take inoculations that's you I respect cam stand on your laurels and not buck that's what they want to do is buck break you unlike Shannon that willingly went along and did it I bet skip Vax shot was different from yours stupid head ppl being lead like cattle
When Jones was Drafted I knew he was the heir apparent. Goodell was in the back with Jones fam laughing a nd having a good ole time. He did not do that with the first pick but with the 15th? Shiiidd. Cam was gone on Deaft day.
ITS NOT ABOUT CAM ITS ABOUT THE VACCINE 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Miami or Washington for Cam. He should Just wait until he gets an opportunity. I'd advise getting vaccinated too Just so the team has more confidence, stability is important. Let's see how Mac does against those first team blitzes.
“Skip! Remember Skip?! Skip the time I said, Skip! Hey Skip I said this…remember Skip? Hey Skip? “ damn Shannon Sharp you can’t get through one sentence without saying “Skip”
GET THE DAMN VACCINE
So he got released because he didn’t get vaccinated? That’s sad talk about government conspiracy!!!!
Bunch of b.s. props to cam for sticking to his guns I wonder if bill knows u can still catch covid after being vaccinated what would've happened then u gunna cut cam halfway into the season cuz the virus broke through????
These mofos say “It’s your choice and right to choose, but  shed a enormous NEGATIVE light with HORRIBLE consequences if you do so.   I’m tired of these puppets
The vaccine should be cams choice. Good for him for not getting it
This is the right move. Cam was just a last minute band aid for last season. He isnt ever going to be the MVP he once was...and he just doesnt fit into the Patriots team-1st mindset. I also wouldnt be surprised if he refused to stay on as a back up. And honestly i dont blame him. I can still see him starting for lesser teams in the league who arent sold on their current QBs.
Redskins Vikings and Rams all need better quarterbacks to compete for a title. Cam should go to anyone of those teams
Yall don't become sheep don't bow down to the bs do not get the vaccine!!! Aside from that idk if that is a good choice think can has alot to offer that team
Why is no one protesting this???? They cut the man because he won't get vaxxed. WTF???
Bill Belitrick. Dude's Jedi Mind Tricks are unmatched
Unc been doing a lot of buck dancing lately.
Broncos probably pick him up
Cam, go to Washington. Reunite with Ron Rivera.
He lit up the  giants wow lol
Feel like Cam is getting a raw deal Cam can still give you what u need at QB he still has alot in the tank and I feel like there are team like Denver, Wash that can use a QB like Cam
Bill Belichick has been making bad decisions bc of his ego. This will be the undoing of his legacy not that he let Cam go but he choose Mac a poor man's Chad Pennington.
They pushing this vax hard.
give Jones a chance see if he impresses or disappoints let the games start before knowing if Jones will fail or not
This is a mistake
If being not being vaccinated had something to do with this, it’s truly sad and telling of what’s to come for everybody
playing well in preseason is one thing playing well in the regular season is something else wish Jones Well.
The NFL is such a Dirty Nasty Place...
Cam goes to Houston if Watson not available? Or Washington
I just never saw Cam as a Patriot, he’s too flashy, flamboyant, and controversial for that team. I see him in the South, Midwest, he can a Raider or a Charger..,
Cam's career is darn near an NFL tragedy.
Wtf wow pats ain’t playing
Way to much added pressure on jones to deliver now!! These first few games will tell patriot fans what there next few years are gonna look like lol its either gonna make him or break him.
So he got cut because he wasn’t vaccinated???
I don’t even see us goin to the playoffs anymore 😭
Take your vaccinations, trust the government!  Take your vaccinations, trust the government!  Take your vaccinations, trust the government!  Take your vaccinations, trust the government! 💉 💉💉😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
It’s crazy on how Skip Bayless called that! ✊🏾  Cam may hear from Colts, Texans, Titans, Broncos, Raiders and WFT for starting spot.
The vaccine doesn’t stop you from getting covid tho?
Cam doesn't want to be a backup.  Not getting the shot probably didn't help either.  Bill is not messing around.
Why would he get the vax? Its not working 🤷‍♂️
This all really came down to being vaccinated."No vaccine, no job" is going to sweep the nation and already started in some states.
Vaccine isn’t going to prevent time lost from covid. You are more likely to be a carrier of covid while vaccinated.
"Cam has always had Tom's number." Yeah, QBs play against defenses.
Cam trying out at TE
Brady left because he saw that the trash bill gave him he went to a loaded team Mac gives them a better chance then cam but should have had to package
But the vaccine do not  keep you from getting covid so y’all point is not valid
This a huge risk and while I know Bill is solidified in his legacy, if this backfires…that could spell the end of an era. Interesting to see, only time will tell
Shannon did you realize getting the Vaccine doesn't prevent you from getting Covid-19
The Pats are gonna regret this once Jones won't be able to set his feet once the pressure comes in week 1.
I’m so shocked as a patriots fan man …seriously no even a backup?
Who wants to have a black Backup QB behind a white QB in these Times. All the Trash Talkers on First Take or Undisputed wants to have, that the black QB plays. They push it in these shows every Day.  Player on the Team are watching this. That only brings unrest to the team that nobody wants!!!
The vax seemed to have been the main talk, from blak man Shannon.  If you are vaxxed, you still get it.  Mac Jones could get it.  Its all fake and all politics.
Yo Cam Come To The Bay Bro
So the vaccine makes you immune? Weak excuses for cutting Cam.
I'm surprised Skip didn't blame lebron
I didn't like Cam when he was in Carolina (Falcons fan here) but I was actually rooting for him in NE, go figure.
Bk up u got covid
Cam is an amazing athlete, I wish him the best, but his mental attitude is a liability, non vaccinated is typical self absorbed Cam.
jenny looking different today
I am not surprised at all that Cam got released by the patriots..... Not one bit ( in my joker voice )  Cam just didn't fit
1. Cam is not very good anymore.  2. Cam taking the side of COVID may make him unavailable again and again.
Cue the cries of racism.
YOU CAN STILL GET COVID WITH THE VACCINE. Shannon do you research.
Cam is gonna have the last laugh when he doesn't get sick from the jab🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dallas here he come
I am not surprised by this decision
Cam will be a Dolphin by the end of the week!
Cam Newton is all about Cam Newton and wasn't a team player
Skip finally got Jenny out of there
the bigger story is Jenny changing her hair 😂 why she so fine😩
U could tell by mac jones body language he Already knew
The kneeling didn't bother but if you force vaccines on these kids I'm done
But what i dont get if it is about the vaccine how come no one is talkn about all of the people that got it and still died from covid???
Vaccination status should not matter and it’s a shame that it does. You shouldn’t be judged for not getting a shot
Football team or Broncos should easily sign Cam
Back to the drawing board for Cam hate to see it but that's how it is especially now the NFL isnt playing about getting vaccinated.
They gave Cam nothing to work with last year.
Wow Shannon!!!  You just told all of us to get the 💉  like your health is not as important as your job🤔
Broncos missed on Jones
Come on To tampa baby bro
Time for the Mac Attack, let's go!!
Bill need too be fired
Wow this sucks no vaccine no starts
Cam should retire. He’s never gonna be close to 2015 cam. If you take that year out the other 10 years are barely average. He’s not the superstar people think he is. He’s Fitzpatrick he’s flacco and if he wants to bounce from team to team then that’s on him but he’s not a top 25 Qb
Its crazy how much of an athletic freak cam is and yet here we are now..
crazy that it comes down to being vax or not vax. i guess thats the world we live in now.
Wow they didn't even give Cam a chance after last year. No loyalty
i just always felt like one mistake and cam was gone, soon as i read about cam having to miss preseason time cause of covid/vaccine issues i knew it was going to be mac jones time, bill doesnt play with distractions or things that will hurt the team if it can be avoided
Cam Newton is WOKE,  he's not Vaccinated and that's why he cut him!!
Yo why do they keep calling him the Kid LOL his first name is just as long
I'm sorry, but does being vaccinated guarantee you won't get the virus??  Cos I don't know about that - I kinda respect Cam now even more.
I'm surprised I thought cam would start the season I didn't think he'd finish the season but I didn't see this coming at least not yet
cam was not vaccinated and can't throw the ball! stick to being a running back cam!!!
Let's see how Mac responds when the Storm comes because preseason is just preseason, when teams prepare for him,hmmm
Players can still get COVID with or without the shot.
I hate this type of business practice. What a blindside.
*Just like Marlo said in the Wire to Prop Joe, “I wasn’t made to play the son”. Cam wasn’t made to play a backup QB so I actually agree with letting him go*
Free cam
Why they keep calling him "The Kid"? Almost like when video games can't pronounce your name so they say your nickname
B.S.
If you are vaccinated you will not be tested for Covid 19 in the NFL
Moral to the story: If you in the NFL, get vaccinated.
Good for New England Shannon Sharpe wrong again! So happy today!
All rookie QBs are projects until proven otherwise. Only time will tell.
wow
I told yall a long time ago that Cam was finished…..
First Buccaneer Brady Super Bowl ring from last year, now this - if the Pats don't win well this year...
Wow....smh
Cam to the Texans sounds good. We need a better QB
The vax doesn’t stop u from gettin the “C” WHEN ARE WE GONNA UNDERSTAND THAT N STOP IGNORING THAT FACT?
The patriots gone regret cutting cam newton
Cam is Mac in reverse.
So because one guy is vaccinated and the other one isn’t is a reason to lose your job? I don’t think that was it
There's only like 3 to 4 QBs in the entire AFC older than 25, I'm pretty sure its Tannehil, Big Ben, and Carr, and I think Wentz and Mahomes. Basically 90% of the AFC are young QB studs. Cam just doesnt look like he can fit the mold as a starter there
Jerry better get Cam
The patriots will regret it. Relying on a rookie out the gate.
I am not surprised. I have been telling everyone sine draft day that Cam will be cut.
Mac trash💯
This is going to bite the patriots hard, because they're starting someone that Belichick thinks its the next Brady when he's not, just to stick it up to Brady, when Brady was great before Belichick.
Cam newton is going to be on the texans.
Cam newton and Tim Tebow were quarterbacks in university of Florida
Mac been knew when he ignored cam for the dap. He was saying to cam u ain’t on this team no more
I’m fine with them choosing Mac but damn releasing Cam this close to the season starting, that’s cold
No barbershop for me today I know everybody finna make it bout black and white🤦‍♂️
These 2 clowns, known as bozo , and cookie the clown, is trying  to promote the vaccination,  and  this gas nothing  to do with the patriots decision,  of picking  a quarterback.  These 2 are canceled.
curry replacing taft should be more of a story than cam
Good luck with your new gig Cam
I remember when The Who and the CDC said you could only catch the bug once. Herd immunity and all that. Also, I thought the vaxx only prevents symptoms, not infection. So if the nfl requires a negative test, not symptoms, doesn’t a vaxxed player miss the exact same amount of time and has the same risk of infection? What am I missing?
The Patriots will regret this and will have a lot of growing pains.
When I saw that distracted by rap music story, I knew his days were numbered.
That's  so disrespectful
They did Cam1Newtown dirty!!  The Audacity and disrespect;  shame on you pats
immore worried about jenny lmaoo. where she at?
That's a real good fact by skip. Cam play exceptional great against Tom Brady
“loyalty from him?!?!” but its fact, that vaccine report prolly played a part because its just a wrench in the wheel n bill really tryna get things going. i say cam goes to the raiders
Not surprising. Cam is a serviceable starter but nothing more. You have a first round pick waiting to take over. It was a smart move to start Jones.
Dont like this topic..at all if it's football stick to football don't get into vaccinated and not vaccinated....cam had covid...and if you understand the science then you know that his body immune system creates antibodies to protect agaisnt covid...so to tell him he needs to get the vaccine is not only unfair but it goes to show you that's all people are concerned with taking the vaccine 😒
Cam to the Texans🤔😑
There are not 32 QBs better than Cam Newton
I like how they dance around the obvious and wonder why....they dont want to get the black audience in a tizzy..theirs always drama with cam...
you can still get covid even though you are vaccinated ... just saying
Am I tripping or does skips hair extra suck today
Fields, Lawrence and Wilson could all be great, but the situations that Mac and Lance landed are perfect. Mac has a top 3 o-line, great coaching, a very talented defense and good receivers (taking into account the TEs). Lance has amazing coaching, great weapons, dynamic running game and a very good defense.  Both of these guys could come in and have a great impact right away. As a pats fan I expect nothing of course, but he could be very great with this situation.
I’m convinced this is Skip’s vocabulary: 🤣   *”Mhm, Tompa Bay, LeGone, LeHate, Cowboys, Diet Mountain Dew & Pro Football Focus”*
No jab, no job!
Anyone surprised about giving cam the boot is what’s wrong with the country
So cam is ice pick Isaac now 🤔 . Wtf
Cam is done... smh
BeliCHEAT may come out correct.  But I doubt it will play out because the opponents are going to bust Mac up!  Cam could rejoin Coach Rivera in Washington.
He's not that good anymore and he's aging.
Mac Jones, Jerry Jones, Chipper Jones, Andruw Jones, Jon Bones Jones, Catherine Zeta Jones, James Jones, Eddie Jones, Indiana Jones, James Earl Jones. Don't matter Cam Newton got cut.
I'm not surprised.
Patriots release Cam Newton Todays society, Patriots are racist!
Cam Newton, Isaac Newton, Fig Newton. Don't matter Mac Jones is the starter
Cam couldn't take a team with no weapons to the playoffs. Good job Bill
They were looking for a reason and got one. Simple
Maybe Cam respects his body more than a game....
People act like you not going to get cov 19 still with Vaccine...you can still get it and it don't protect you from it..it just get your body immune to it like the flu shot...the virus in the shot... they just now approving some of the shots now 🤔🤯
Vaccines?? Wow Shannon you’re despicable
😳🤯
Canned Newton
Woooooooow!
Shannon keeps coming here talking about how “one is vaccinated and the other is not.” Last time I checked,Mac Jones also declined to answer whether he was vaccinated several weeks ago.
I been told cam newton don't go there that's not where he is going to be most successful at the vaccine ain't got nothing to do with athleticism Mac Jones is younger and more ready can sound have been left 2 years ago the bears or another team would have been better for him to play at
Everybody keep that same energy about Mac💯 Bama fans know what he is capable of
It is over for Cam no way he can bounce back from this mentally or be a starter for another team you already got your money just Retire.. I ain't no hater don't @me
Funny how they kneel over inequality and then show prejudice to people who haven't gotten the vaccine.
There will be growing pains and I don't think he's fully ready yet, but Bill knows better than me. All the Mac Jones fanboys better not turn on him when he sucks. He's going to struggle at times. Not going to be an easy ride this year.
I hope Mac Jones and New England fall on on his face you cut a mvp  player for this before the season starts Bill  lost all my respect
The hoodie made the best decision for the team
7-9 season on deck
THE🇺🇸🏈🏆NFL___
If you have the vaccine you can still catch covid....??
Well! ROLL TIDE does it AGAIN to War Eagle!!! 🤣🤣🤣
They acting like you can't get covid with the vaccine🤦🤦🤦stop trying to make people take a experiment shot...what's going to be said when vaccinated player effect another vaccinated player???
Shannon wrong for this.  Cam already got COVID, the chances of him getting it again are extremely extremely unlikely.
Cam Newton > Tim Tebow
😲
Cam is the Carmelo of the nfl. At this point hes not a starting qb in this league anymore. Once he realizes that and humbles himself he will thrive in whatever role or opportunity that comes his way.
Wtf the Vaccine have to do with anything, @ Skip and @Shannon the Vaccine is still experimental, let those who want to wait, wait. You even threaten my job because of a Vaccine, you might want to rethink your life, period
Before Drew Bledsoe and Tom Brady who was Bill Belichick's quarterback ? He didn't have star
pride is good but this kind doesn't help at all. maybe cam should try canadian football league
Come to Houston and take us to the play offs
Shannon: "Loyalty is not what the Patriots do" 💯
This is that part of the Falcon and the Winter Soldier where John Walker becomes Captain America!
The patriots will regret this.
Vaccine don't stop covid or the spread and you will still test positive. Idiot nfl
Don't worry fanboys. He coming out with that LGBTQ clothing line for you.
Cam shoulda jumped on that football back in the 2015 super bowl and he wouldn’t have none of these issues..smh
Bet I won’t watch another Patriots game again
They can’t stop with this damn vacation
Bill Belichick saw all these segments and said “Ok…fine”
CAM TO THE STEELERS
Where's my Jenny? The only reason I watch Skip is because of her.
where he belongs in the cheese line lol
Popular Opinion: Every single one of y'all agrees Bellichick made our Day much better:
I mean even vaccinated these athlete can still catch it. Are we forgetting what just happened to Chris Paul this past playoffs
Good job Patriots
Top 5 landing spots for Cam:  Texans  Eagles  Bengals(if Joe gets hurt)  Giants  Saints
The Patriots aka The Great White has done it
Well there goes my rooting interest.
I hope the pats lose over 13 games lol damn idiots
CUT DALTON! CUT DALTON!
So cam didn’t take the vaccination and he gets cut. He did it to himself in
I hope he becomes a raider or charger so Von can see him twice a year
Vaccine doesn't cure or prevent the critters. I don't understand the upheaval about the vaccine. Can't work or buy bc vaccine is a force of hand to those who value their bodies in a different way.
Whats crazy is i was just watching the vid lastnight when Skip and Shannon was just agreeing that Cam would be starting, wild they cut him today.
They have to realize Mac was playing against 2nd and 3rd string let’s see how he do against 1st string
Not surprised, CAM should chalk it up as a learning experience on his pro football resume,  keep it moving CAM  / PATRIOTS didn't know how to use CAM
This needed to be done now I'm glad Mac Jones time is now the Patriots are moving forward now we look forward to Brady vs Jones 😬
I can trust bill on this but I believe cam would've gave us a better shot in the first few games. Jones first start will be against that Miami defense 😬. I wish they would've kept cam "loyalty I deserve it" 🤷🏽‍♂️😂
He needs to go to Washington 🤷🏽‍♂️
Cant wait till we see vaccinated players get covid
All Cam had to do was to get vaccinated. Lost ground and then they didn't need him anymore. No new team will take him on if he has to go through covid protocol every week.
well, there's the end of that.
Imagine getting cut after chasing the dude taking your job tryna get a high 5
Patriots are just letting people know they are in the rebuilding phase
Cam is back up at this point.
so what about vaccinated people who have the rona?
Damn Cam finally got some weapons and this happens, as I said Cam is the most disrespected athlete of all time, hopefully you get another chance I wish you the best Cam!
Mac vs Tua in Week 1. Should be a interesting game.
You know what this means. Week 4 it's gonna be Mac Jones vs Tom Brady when the Bucs come to New England. That game's gonna be a sellout.
Somebody screenshot my comment now the Patriots won’t even make the playoffs
Cam sucks
🖕🏾 the patriots Belichick I don’t fw you no more Mac Jones 🗑
Cam like "Not like this"...they didn't even give him a chance to regroup and audition for another team
Go to Dallas Cam...its a good idea💡.
Now y'all about to see how Brady was really made 📽️🎥
They’re only paying Cam $3.5 million. Why not keep as a back up? I don’t think Mac would be phased one bit.
I would've never guessed 5 yrs ago that in 2021 you could loose a job because you refused to be injected 😳
hahaha Come out Cam fans, tell me again how great he is.
That was not a smart move by the patriots.7-10 at best,they definitely not making the playoffs
Honestly the only place I can really see Cam actually starting is Houston, and that's if and only if they trade Deshaun Watson
I wish they would've at least kept him on the team. They seem like they had a good bond even tho they were competing . It just sucks because I know Cam (probably)  won't get another job.
Let’s just hope Mac Jones lives up to  hype id hate to see this backfire
Bill threw Cam off the team like he was the Undertaker and Cam was Mick Foley.  REST IN PEAAAAAACCCCEEEE!!!!!!!
I once heard a football coach say: “You just can’t trust a black QB.”
The fact that Cam didn't even make the roster is more shocking
He might as well go back to the panthers
Good sh*t cam ,don't get the vac.
This has nothing to do with vaccination
W for Skip
People on Instagram making this about race smh
Ouch it seems cam can’t catch a break.
Cam sucks is anyone shocked
Cam should go to Houston
The Patriots made the right decision, albeit a controversial one. Cam had 2600 yards, 8 touchdowns and 10 interceptions last year.
patriots will miss the playoffs yet again this year, & brady is torching these bums week 4
AFC East youngest division of QBs of all time  Tua - 23 Josh - 25 Zach - 22 Mac - Turns 23 on Sep 5
What 🤔
Mr. Bayless was right about this one.
You can't deny this wasn't going to come to past but not this soon.

This was a big surprise
Cam couldnt catch a break if he was on the bench
