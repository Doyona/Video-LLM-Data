What a sweetheart! 😍🥰
I have a Rottweiler
Awe he is such a cutie pie🥰
My favorite and imo BESTEST dog breed EVER
I know this video is old but I'm sure Bronson grew up to be a VERY big boy. Those big paws and his big head are the signs 💕 he's too cute 🥰
What a handsome lil gentleman!  🥰
A Pug named *Meatball*  I love it!
Such a sweet boy! 😍
Rooties love stepping on dogs
Yay! A Rottweiler with an unadulterated tail.
Rottweiler puppies are the cutest type of puppy. If you think any other puppies are cuter, you are confusing your preference with objective fact.
I love that Bronson hasn't had his tail docked!
What a baby! I wonder how he is now!
Good boy
Adorable
❤😊
He still has his tail !!

You named him meatball? 😂😂🤣🤣

I love how precious Rottweilers are. They’re big, scary pushovers.

This is the first experience that all puppies need to avoid trauma and future aggressiveness.

Don't you mean PAWsitive reinforcements?
Good move! Get them started out young, and small!
I love your videos! I wish you could groom my Bandit! Can you do a video grooming a Lhasa Apso?
four months old and already big boy!!! he's gonna grow up to be a gentle giant
It's up to owners to reinforce the grooming. Praise them excessively. Tell them how beautiful they are, how great they smell, etc, etc.   They will associate getting groomed with lots of praise and loving. And most will gladly be groomed. Worked for all my dogs, except one. She loved anything that stunk, especially dead animals and rotten eggs. So the nice smell turned her off. And she didn't care for excessive attention. Just a rub from my foot while she laid under my desk at work, or just laying under the coffee table next to where I sat at home. Her fav was catching and killing field rats when I Bush hogged.
Rottweilers are huge as puppies. I have a German Shepherd Rottweiler mix, he's about to be a year old and he's damn near as big as me. Obviously a bit of an exaggeration, but he's an absolute monster. His name is Shadow, and he's a good boi
What a sweetie ❤
Bronson is precious. Looks like my Sassy.
bronson @ the end was like: wheres my treats at?
Now I want a Rottie again, I love these goofy babies, they got hearts of gold and are such lovable puppies

Where are you guys located?? I have a black lab boxer mix. A year old. Around a hundred lbs. I take him every 6 months to get his nails done, at the pet shop, we normally end up doing them, with their supplies because they can't handle him and they don't have the equipment like you do, that or they don't know how to use it. But I need a new groomer.   So im wondering what state y'all are in?
What a cutie!  Gonna be a chow hound!
So cute 😢 I cry
SO CUTE!!!
The Dogs have asked me to Tell You to Stop Spraying them with Cologne!!! Their sense of smell is Very Sensitive and they don't like it. They said they aren't Cheap Hookers, Stop it with the Cologne!!!!
What a good sweet boy!

I had a rottie named Onix, he was 4 years old. He was the sweetest thing. We took him to the groomers and all he did was stay calm and give them full face kisses. I miss him, rest in peace boy.
What a super cutie! And this video also does a great job on how to well train your dog.
What a handsome pup.

This 4-month-old Rottweiler named Bronson crashed my YT app.
Our Rottweiler was a real fan of taking baths, she used to love to take some showers and groom; miss her all the time.

Look at how nice his coat looks after ❤
Great job, Bronson! But now I need a pug named ‘Meatball.’ That’s too perfect!
Thank you for many entertaining videos.  I will never stop hating the moment you talk about spraying the dogs down with cologne.  Why??? - From the perspective of a dog... Both unnecessary an torturous.
Look at that face.
so cute!! 😍
The “Blueberry cologne” gets me every time💙
My pomchi loves the drier. He always has. Except he also blocks all the warm air vents in winter. Im cold!
GIRL WHAT THE FUCK BRONSON AND MEATBALL ARE THE NAMES OF MY DOGS TOO THIS IS WEIRD...

Meatball, who wouldn't play with a meatball ? It's a funny name. I'll let my dog  play with a meat ball anytime  ! A Rottweiler is a great dog yo have if they fit into your daily rooteen !
Bronson is such a cute customer.

He’s so cute
Such a handsome and goodest of bois!!
❤❤❤❤ bb bronson!!!
He's adorable
I LOVE HIM <3 <3
I once met a Rottweiler and Pitbull mix puppy in a petco.  Most adorable thing ever.  Running all over the place, trying to play with some dog or person, only to get distracted by a different person or dog.  Insanely adorable.  The sad part was remembering that most times, such a mix is headed straight to the arena.    Pitbulls and Rottweilers can be very dangerous, but that's if they are raised poorly.  If the owner trains them well, and doesn't put them into high stress environments, they are loving and affectionate dogs who can warm anyone's heart.
omg he’s so cute my heart
Oh so cute🤗
Meatball 🐶 How appropriate. 😅
Bronson: what is this black magic
Never Put Any Parfum on a dog.  The dog's sense of smell is damaged in the long term.  Some dogs get downright sick. as a Good groomer you should know this..my Opinion
Time to play….and a treat?
Do they make clean dog shampoo
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
WHAT A PRECIOUS CHONK 🤩
Pawsitive reenforcement
Wow! Coincidence or fate? I'm literally on my way home from a wedding where the groom was named bronson!

AHHH MEATBALL  I LOVE THE NAME
Meatball needs more screentime
Bronson is absolutely adorable!!
I love Rottweilers Top tier breed
Bronson is so cute I hope he grew up nice and happy
Bronson was such a good boi!
I love the eyebrow dots on rottweilers! They're so cute!
great  meatball
Meatball is such a perfect name for a pug
I just come here for the farbic head scarf that holds the dogs ears back.
I love how genuinely clean these dogs look at the end. They always look so fuzzy like a stuffed animal straight out of the dryer
He's so pretty.
Cute 🥰
bronson REALLY didnt wanna sit still^^
Love you Bronson
Looks like a little black meatball 💩 was rolling around on the floor as the two of them played
Das a babie, I lobe dat babie
Such a handsome Rottie..
Dog grooming is great, the only thing I dislike is the perfume.... it stinks and leaves the fur slightly matted and clumped
How much does a average grooming cost? Just wondering
How do you pick the different colognes for the dog?
Beautiful!!
Rotties have the best eyebrows ever!
Great name for such a pup. 👍
Awh Bronson is adorable
Aaaaaaaw a babyyy
I work as a vet assistant and I can confirm treats work wonders with puppys. If I have to give a puppy their first shots, I always give them a treat, and then they don’t even notice the pokes
He is so adorable and I like your method
"This is Bronson, he is freaking adorable."
Why do you spray him in cologne, it's just an unnecessary waste of resources
Aww he looks so fluffy 🐶🥰
So cute
*deep inhale* Baby! 😐❤️😂
Im a vet nurse & I love Rottweilers at work. No matter how ill they are when they’re admitted, you know you’ll be able to get them to eat in order to recover.  ...Unless they’re there BECAUSE *they eat everything.* A needle pad, rocks, rubber duck, underwear (didn’t belong to owners girlfriend...)
Dang they are just too cute
Bronson is adorable!😍
He's a very good pupper.  Very well behaved boy
Adorable!!!
He is gorgeous
Such a little sweetie, and so happy to see he was allowed to keep his tail-wagger !  👍 🇨🇦 ✌️
You know it's so good to see this puppy WITH his tail. Most owners cut the tail off completely leaving a tail stub. Who ever owns this puppy kudos to you. I'm proud. ♡   He looks like a sweetheart !
Hahaahah babe does blep at the end 😍🥰
Meatball is just... such a perfect name for that dog
What a cutie!!
I need more meatball in my Life. 🤣😍
He's SOOOO CUTE
My boy Bronson!!
Bronson is SO CUTE
Please.stop spraying dogs with artificial synthetic fragrances.  They hate it
this makes me happy and sad, she's so pretty like my rottweiler 'bella' but unfortunately she died months ago.
So wonderful!!!! This needs to be broadcasted to every pet owner ever!!!!!
Great way to teach pup
Soo cute
Bronson is too adorable for words!!!❤️🥰😊
He’s beautiful
He’s so freaking cute 🥰

He's so cute. Definitely a baby attention span. Highly focused on what they want but also excited.
Sweet baby
Super handsome pup!! He’s making some hoomans mighty happy!!
A very cute boi.
Dont pet these cute mfs and even if you do, make sure you train them well and get them comfortable around other people cuz they don't listen to anybody else except their owner, I had one when I was in 7th grade, mf ripped out a chihuahua in 3 pieces while on a casual walk wit me
Cuteness overload. 💖💖💖
So cute and adorable.😊
He Soo cute!!!

He'll be a big Boofhead by his third visit 😉

I want a rotty so much. Love the big goofballs
I think you meant to say “4-month old bundle of love.”

My friend had a Rottweiler she was such a sweet girl. Even though her tail has the night of Zeus when it was swinging
Bronson is such a cutie...😊😊😊....
It's so amazing to see a Rottweiler with a tail 😍 ❤️
Meatball is the best name for a pug, if I ever get one that’s what I’m naming it
Proper beauty 😍
He's big but he looks so little he's so cute I'm going to cry
So cute
Is there someway I can nap these peoples dog cuz he's so God damn cute
Bronson says, "don't you have anything more masculine than blueberry cologne?"
I had a Rottweiler but she sadly had to be put down i forget what was wrong but she went blind 2 weeks before we put her down her name was lyiric because my mom loves music and is a DJ and she's a good singer she was the first dog I remember haveing as a kid ❤ 💔 her birthday was March 17 and mine is March 18th so you can bet she was one of my favorite dogs and every year on her birthday my family drives 2 hours to where we burried her to sing her happy birthday❤ I love Rottweilers they are very loving and protective
I want Bronson 😩
I'm going to buy a dog just so i can name it Meatball lmao
Bootiful Boy
Such a cute boi. I wanna pet him so badly
So cute 🥰
Can you  please  do Doberman
I adore dogs with eyebrows
I like that whenever u put the ear protection on the dogs they look like worms on a string
He reminds me of my pup just that my pup would die of seperation anxiety if we left him at a groomers apointment we tried once to blow dry him at a petshop where we could shower him he HATED it but he also Paw alot when he play
Omg he’s so cute I love him so much he reminds me of my old dog

What a good boy! He’s clearly been very well trained and socialized.
Hi Bronson. I love you!
Try a little variation in your speaking tone. Your monotone dead woman sound makes these unpleasant to watch
Your videos want me to get a fluffy dog and take him to the groomer bi-weekly
That’s not my dog
Soooo fluffy!!!

There are different opinions about dog colognes and other types of perfumes for dogs. In some cases, specialists say that they don’t cause any harm to the animal.  However, according to the opinions of others, it’s not a good idea and it’s best to let your dog smell like a dog.
So the shampoo is deirty
Bronson is very handsome 😀
Bronson is so cute. So handsome 😍😍😁😁

I have the at dog.
I have a german rottweiler and omg he's only like 3 years old and hes so big, he adorable and a sweetheart so cute, but back to my main point my dad got to name him and i dont think his name suits him, his name is Brutus and istg it really doesn't suit him
They don't do this for me when I go to the salon? 😥 Maybe I should let them know I'm a little scared of the hair dryer?
Good job!  What an adorable puppy!
I have 4 Rottweilers and they are the sweetest they aren’t scary dogs AT ALL

Rotties are the cutest puppies next to black Labrador who look like sea lions.

What a sweet boy 💕
I have a Rott I adopted at 11 months who is named Bronson. 😳 My kid has no tail, however.
Who’s a good boy?! Yes you are!
So sofffffftttt
If you want him clean why you use dirty dog shampoo,isn't that kinda backwards?😕😒 (Jokes)😑
Love Bronson and Meatball. I used to have a rottie mix and I currently have a pug terrier mix.
No wonder his name is meatball
My method for pretty much all dogs, but especially skittish ones, was to turn the dryer on while the nozzle was behind me and pointed away, and then after a few pets I'd slowly bring it up and beginning their hind legs. I love the treats idea! We were never allowed to use them because of possible allergies, so my positive reinforcement was lots of pets.
😘
Love watching these wish you were near me to get my puppies groomed
Hermoso chiquitín
are they trying to be like the “number 15” guy or something. not trying to be rude. but they kinda sound a little like him.
He’s so cute
❤️Bronson❤️Meatball
I want to play with meatball too
WHAT A CUTIE PIE 😭😍
Yeah because a Rottweiler totally needs to visit the dog groomer 🤣 I get it with many dog breeds but a Rottweiler? Has to be one of the easiest dog breeds grooming wise. How lazy are some dog owners?!
You mean... _paw_ sitive reinforcement??
Pawsitive reinforcement
Change all rottweiler dog names to chop
Good vidio
My mom misinterpreted my squeal of delight at his cuteness and came running to see what was wrong!
He really pulls off the head sock
👍
Considering that a dog's sense of smell is like 40 x stronger than that of humans, it doesn't seem like a good idea to put perfume on them😒
I fckin love dogs
What an adorable boy! Such a good Puppy! I really want one but the breeders around me want over $2,000 for one and I can’t afford that. 😢😭
PAWSitive reinforcement?
Someone needs to seed this to that dude with the growling snarling rotty that swears he's a good dog lmao
Absolutely love you.  Where r u located???? Will breed g my two  dogs and kitty.
Such a cute little guy! So friendly! Love his little eyebrows!❤❤❤❤❤
He’s soooo cute!!!!
What a handsome boy!
And people say Rottweilers are very aggressive dogs and are the worst dog breed because of that...  Please do know that any "Living Thing" on this planet can become something horrible and aggressive if that's the life they've been dealt... But things can be different if you do your best to bring happiness and love into every living things life...   This handsome boy of a rottweiler is so cute🤭♥️✨
Am I the only one who thinks that meatball should be called meatloaf?
Hello😝 💎
Ngl, the playtime at the end made me go AWWW
Rottweiler puppies are genuinely the cutest 🥰 They look just like teddy bears! Also, such a good strategy to get them used to the grooming process early on!
"Towel him dry"😳
Blueberry cologne... That's retarded.
Had a Rottweiler growing up. He was so gentle and sweet! Was trained to protect and could eat a cheeseburger in a single bite. So cool! Before you ask the burger was a special treat not something he had everyday. His name was Thunder. God, I miss him. 😞
Do you think you could actually threw my dog because he's a German Shepherd black lab English Mastiff he's 3 years old I've had him since he was a puppy but the problem is no one can groom him because he has a problem with nail clippers bathing him is not a problem just the nails
What a beautiful puppy...
Personally, i prefer Rotties that have tails. The ones without look meaner, but i like a good looking tail.
I’m glad Bronson has a tail, I hate it that Americans cut their dogs tail and ears.
Sweet little wholesome baby😍🥰
What a good bebe
Oh he’s gonna be a big boy.
Play with meatball 🤭🤗
He’s so cute!
Branson is the cutest puppy ever!!!
What a good boi, precious.
Rothwell are just the best.
😠 killer dog
Omg I love Bronson 😍😍
what do you need that rag on your face for?
Hes so adorable!!!!
I love him so much! How did you resist giving him a bunch of kisses??
Beautiful puppy
Silly doggo just wants the treatos
So sweet 🥺
Hes so poofy!
Cute!
Wat shampoo ur using for dead hair removal. While bathing the dogs like shepherd
I absolutely love me a Rottweiler !!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Rotty pups are so fucking cute!
🥺😍
He’s so stinkin cute. Love his name Bronson!
My family used to raise Rotts when I was a kid….so adorable watching them grow
Bronson is such an adorable puppy. 🤩❤
His parents are doing great at training him! Rott’s take 3yrs to mature and fight tooth and nail to be the alpha. Great dogs, just gotta have patients with those babies
I need to hug Bronson right now please
He's perfect
i thought perfumes were bad for dogs? like they want to get rid of the smell plus the alcohol dries out their skin?
So nice good job 🤟🏼
🥺❤️
He is just beautiful
So incredibly cute! 😍
He is ADORABLE🥰
He’s so cute 🥰
I love Rotties so much. I have 2.
His fur looks so soft like velvet 🥰
Sweet
Now that big Bronson is groomed ill pick him up now 🐕 😎he's a handsome boy!
My heart just exploded from cuteness overload.
What a cutie!
He looks so floofy 😍
So cute!
SO FLOOFY
Freaking adorable 😍
Puppy got the wiggles
Such a little good boie!!
"Meatball" 🤣🤣🤣
I LOVE HIM
That's much to much of everything. Just water, he drys on his own and perfume for a dog...come on. ? My dog is 16 now and i washed him maybe three times. And his fur is shines silky..natur do it all on it's own. Thank you..a nice purple day..
Bronson is treated better than most humans treat other humans
Clipping for cats or dogs is wrong. Do not be proud of yourselves
SO handsome!!
Bronson and meatball sounds like the alternate version to Calvin and Hobbes..   I can say that I wouldn't mind that 😁
Aww Meatball 🥰🥰
I like that his tail isn't cut off, I hate it when ppl cut off their ears or tails
Such a good boy
I would die for him
He's cute.
He is soooo cute
Omg what a cutie pie 🤗❤️
Mr poofers
I'm sooooooo happy this guy hasn't had his tail docked like people are wont to do with rotties. I absolutely HATE when people do that crap. It's barbaric and cruel.
He'll need training, also
He is Absolutely Adorable
Meatball is a perfect name for Meatball 😂
My dog is obsessed with watching these with me it’s so cute 🥰
Goodest boy ❤
That puppy face is absolutely adorable. I want one!
That is a cute dog
Sooo cute
Now that's a well socialized puppy
So beautaful dog
Cute guy
Bronson is a very Rottweiler name. Very strong, short but not too much. Meatball is also a very pug name. Very silly, like a pug.
You shouldn't use nail clippers instead a dremel or sander...
Why are you wearing a mask lmfao
Blueberry Cologne...? C'mon human.
"He's excited and wants more treats!" Hahaha, the quote of all quotes!
So cute 🥺
Ooh Bronson and Meatball are adorable!💓🤗
He’s so adorable!!
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Meatball is the obvious MVP here
Aw such a gorgeous little papa!
Tee hee hee hee
What a cutie!!!
Bronson es taaaaaaaaaan bonito 😍😍😍😍😍😍 que me ha enamorado
Bronson so cute dog
He's a beautiful puppy!
What a sweet little blueberry 😊
Look, the owners kept his tail intact. That's how it should be, and shame on other owners who don't
A fat Pug named meatball
😍😍😍😍
Bronson is a good boy who deserves all hugs and kisses
YOU COULD HAVE WASHED BRONSON'S FACE A LITTLE BIT BETTER 😒
Bronson. Right. After grooming he will get back to his bro puppies Hitler and Manson. Some people must be put to sleep.
Why do you have to wear the mask
Oh my goodness, what a cutie 🥰 such a good boy
He cute but the vid itself gay
They are so fuckin cute and adorable
A rotty with blueberry cologne.............. Fuck *pet pet pet pet*
I WANT MEATBALL
Blueberry Cologne lol

Jesus is coming soon, get saved, repent, and follow God’s will!
He is so cute!!!
All ready to jump in a big puddle of mud you didn't know existed.
Meatball💀
Lmao, Meatball 😂 -- greatest doggo name ever.
what people fail to realize is that Rottweilers along with any other dog breed aren't dangerous and aggressive by default but because that way because of their owners
Idk why but I love hearing her say blueberry cologne 😂
I don't know why, but Meatball is the perfect name for a pug. XD
Absolutely ADORABLE!!!
I WANT Bronson!!! Can I keep him?? PLEASE?!!!
Bronson is so cute with his little puppy tongue sticking out
Look at the little beans that form his eyebrows.  I love those little beans.
I'd give u a thousand bucks if u could do that with my dog goose.
My dog is scared of the groomer she is soper sweet just had some bad experience with grooming she is a small dog but she is a service dog so she is soper well behaved but she sack and has her Owen anxiety attack but she has to get gromd she is a long herd dog. does anyone have any advice to get her less scare of the groim cus we drop her off she clings to me  but here normal groom is grat with her but bisy so getting her in is hard but I feel really bad leving when she is scared because she dose so much for me any advise ty I gromd her at home and she look so bad but it had to be done

"Meatball" 👀... 😍🤎 How cuuute is that name!! 🥰😘🍝
Awe blueberry Bronson
I'm actually sick of seeing pets
😍😍
Good job.
Had a rotten rottie myself a few years back. They make the goofiest sounds!
That face is too cute
All that positive reinforcement is gonna have him puking on the car ride home.
Bronson is such a precious good boi 😭
He's Soo darn Cute such a Good Boy too🥰
He still has his tail, how a rottweiler should be
He's so cute!
there is a neighbor dog I say hi to it took some time for that sog to know me.  adorable video.
I'm just looking at this video and feeling bad I didnt learn the dog to take a showe when he was a puppy😢 now it isnt possile- only wet tipes for dogs. DO NOT MAKE YOUR PETS SHOWER- THIS MIGHT BE VERY BAD FOR THEM IN THE LONG RUN
Omg he's so handsome lol
In typical puppy fashion, the treats come out and everything else fades away
And my dad thinks that Rottweilers are natural killers who are extremely aggressive even as puppies 😒 how could someone look at this cute little fella and think he's savage
A rotisserie that still has his tail!!!
Cutest little guy
He is beautiful!
LOOK AT THE LITTLE BOO BOO. I LOVE THOSE DOGS.
Djdbhekeokdbbd!!!! CUTE PUPPY!!!!!!!
He is soooo cute!!!! 😍😍😍😍
Pugs are gross
Meat ball lol I love them both
His eyebrows are so cute
He's just a little cutie 😀!!
Bronson is so cute!!!
❤❤❤❤
I swear that dog gets bigger in every timelapse
What do you do if the ears aren’t clean when you check them at the end
I want him 😫 😭🥰💝
He's gonna be a BIG GOOD BOI!!
Is that ear cover designed for this job?
He's so darn adorable
That is an adorable rottie!

That is going to be a *_BIG_* doggy!
Bronson is handsome as shit
Bronson is SOOO ADORABLE 🥰🥰 meatball is too cute 🥰🥰 they're gonna be friends for life 😂🤣😄✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Cute🌸🌸🌸🌸😇😇😇😇
This is better. Beautiful lil baby. ❤️
While totally adorable, I don't get why a Rottweiler needs to go to a groomer? Lol 😆 I'd wash him myself. I mean, I wash my shih tzus myself until they need trimming and a Rottweiler never needs trimming. Maybe I'm missing something.
Meatball lmbo that dog is a meatball soooooo CUTE!!!
So cute
It's painful how cute Bronson is 😍💔
Happy New Year, stay safe and healthy💖🥰.
What a good boi!!!  Good boi Bronson.
Bronson looks like such a sweetie. I hope he was easy to groom!
Why are these such fitting names? 😆  Bronson and Meatball...it's perfect!
Why put a choke collar on him, it's absurd and CRUEL. You should put a NORMAL collar that does not hurt them and has those intentions.🙄🚫
?..my grand dog HATES any type of grooming and I can't stand it because I love for him to be in the house with me. He won't let you do any type of grooming, he just got to the point that he'll let me clean matter from his eyes, but anything else he gives me a growl. Is there anyway to change this behavior???
I never bathed my puppys until he was about 9 months. They didn't need one. As they were only little king Charles. They never ever smelled. They had that new puppy smell for ever. I used hypoallergenic wipes though 3 times a week. Now they are 13 I bath them only 3 times a year. Love Rotty's my sister  and dad have them.
Haay little puppy brandson how is life..
Blueberry cologne... really? Dogs are really sensitive to smells and use them as a form of communication. Showering them in tons of fake aromas is not ok. They are animals, not toys.
Que bonito es,es adorable
Hes such a cutie omg I'm gonna pass away
Why would you perfume a dog?
Who doesn't wanna do this for their own dog? That was nothing they couldn't do for him at home
He is so cute!! And fluffy looking~!
Meatball, great name
Damn, that puppy is cute!
What a cutie....love his face....
Excellent amazing job 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🥰👍🏻

I got a single light y'all a big d
What a gorgeous puppy! Can I steal him away?
He’s so adorable
Not to be dramatic, but I would die for Bronson and Meatball.
Happy Bronson 🐾🐾 Meatball Ha ha gr8 name 💙💙💙
Adorable dogs.😊🐾
Yet they grow up to be monsters I’d shoot them all if I could. A “nice” one nearly killed my dog a few years ago and that’s when I started researching the breed. They all eventually snap.
Great!!!
Nice!!!
He’s sooo cute ☺️
They’re so cute
Sooo cute 😍 Meatball 😂 💖
He is so cute

Ch-ching! $$$$
Daw
He’s so handsome
OMG he's adorable
BEFORE YOU START TALKING POOP 💩 ABOUT EAR CROPS, AND TAIL DOCKS, DO THE WORLD A FAVOR AND SHUT THE HELL  😈 UP  I WORK IN A SHELTER AND I HAVE NEVER GOTTEN A DOG WITH EARS CROPPED TO US BUT WE SURE DO GET ALOT OF FAMILIES WITH KIDS AND COUPLES WITHOUT KIDS GOING THRU DIVORCES TURNING THEIR DOGS IN !  NO BODY TALKS ABOUNT THAT !  BUT YEAH EVERYONE WANTS TO CALL OUT PEOPLE WH O CROP DOG EARS OR GWT TAILS DOCKED.  When i was little my mother pierced my ears 👂 but hey ain’t nobody said  💩
MEATBALL
If only Bronson could stay that small and cute lol Rotts get too big!!
The little towels around their heads are adorable 😍
I look at him and wonder is that Arlo, or Tucker? I have 2  adorable 10 wk old Australian Kelpies that are chubby as hekkk
Bronson is so cute!! I don't like the breed of what meatball is but he'll be an exception only because of his name lol.🍝
The comfort hoodie on this little guy is everything. He looks like a fluffy caterpillar with eyebrows, he's so cute I can't stand it.
Handsome puppy ❤️. Congratulations little guy ❤️
Most people: Rottweilers are dangerous! Me: Aw, look at the little cutie pie, giving puppy kisses!
Bronson
Now its time to play with meatball hahaa
Bronson will grow up into a 100+ pound dog beast. He's beautiful
He is SO CUTE💖
As a groomer I can smell that blueberry cologne
Hello! Can you please do a Queensland Heeler or Austrian Cattledog?
He s so sweet
So cute
Rottweiler puppies are just adorable!
That was some really nice Action.    .....If you know, you know
I’m pretty sure that dog gained twenty pounds by the end of his bath….
Great job, once again why spray anything scented on a dog???? They have incredible sense of smell, I could only imagine how unpleasant that would be for the dog and they have no way of getting it off of themselves.
Very nice!
Nice!  🌟💗
I miss my rot!! 11 years now 5 at rainbow bridge.
Bronson is adorable!!!
What an absolute cutie 😍😍😍😍
Sont Tu cute!!!

So adorable the puppy is!!! The cute 😊!!!!
Ficou fofinho e cheiroso 😃😍❤
I want him! 😍
I wish i kept my rottweilers. I really had no choice because my dad was the business owner and i was just there to train and comfort them, but i always had to let them go. These pups are so cute. I remember sleeping with them, (as in just cuddling them above my air vent with a small blanket on top while i pet them to sleep) and they were so soft and comfortable to rub my fingers against. They loved pets and would always jump around. I named one Akari, a boy who loved to watch me refill their water while the rest of the litter slept. He was always near my side (literally) and sometimes he would fall asleep while i was playing outside with him and in my lap. It was adorable. I love rottweilers. :)
I'm sorry but meatball😭😭😭😭 so cute
Meatball 😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😂 funny name  but ok
rottweiler puppies are the CUTEST 😍😍
Dogs have colognes now...?
His brown spots on his eyebrows are actually perfect

Jovi0tw
I love how despite being in a strange room,with people he can't see their faces. Bronson's instincts is to give kisses first hand,not to whimper and cause a scene,such a sweet boy! 🥰
Omg! Such an adorable puppy 🥰
So cute, will be double that size at 8 months!
Love that he the same size as meatball
Positive reinforcement might be good for my mom's dogs. They HATE having their nails clipped.
Aren't you not supposed to use scented products on dogs?  Their smell is insane, scented products can easily be bothersome to them
Awww so cute!!
People often underestimate the pure adorableness of Rotties. They're so perfect!
Look at that precious face!
😊😊❤❤
Gorgeous
It’s not their fault they are very talkative and growl and bark even though their not mad it’s how they express themselves kinda sad they get put down for that
He looks so handsome! Nice job
So cute !☠️
Bronson is such a good boy 🥺😍❤️
No dog in the world needs a f***in' cologne!   Stupid people on a stupid planet ...
Adorable lovely Bronson.💟
✍️give treats while cleaning the pet ✍️ make good memories
Oh I hope to see more of Bronson for sure. Are there more videos with meatball?
So cute 😍
Aaaawwww my old dog his name was bronson he was a pitbull
If it weren't for the face I wouldn't believe that was a puppy
I love it
Sooooooooo cute
He's  so Handome :)
Aawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
His paws are massive for 4 months
❤
I have a massive female rottie. She’s absolutely gorgeous and majestic. She used to hate bathing, and water in general, but now she’s a water baby, she loves swimming, and baths (for only me I guess) I can’t take her to the groomers Bc she hates them. So I do it all. Glands and all 🤮 but it needs done, so I do it. She’s a pretty pretty princess. Js. Rottweilers ain’t for everyone, but I enjoy mine!!!
Cute
He’s a good boy!
👍👍👍👍👍😄😄😄😃😃😃😄🐶🐕👍😄😄😄😄😄😄.....🐞🐞🐞♂️🗼🇨🇵
LOL… “Meatball”… 😂that’s awesome!!
Beautiful baby. That will turn into a big beautiful baby.
Tooooo cute❤️❤️❤️
Can you do a Dalmatian please
"Let go of me Huma!— Oh food!"
Rotties are so cute, my aunt's one was ruled by her cat who was a tiny black girl she would smack him in the face with her tiny paws 🤣
Oh he looks just like my fluffy girl!!! Mine is mixed, but she's got the same markings as any rotty, but with a big fluffy tail like a retriever, and perky ears, she's so sweet
Omg
I wish Rottweilers would stay 4 month old puppies forever! 🥰
Oi
So so cute
Such a handsome man😊
I used to have a Rottweiler stuffed animal when I was small, never ran into the dog breed before so when I couldn’t find the bead eyes because they were black and blended in with the fur I assumed the brown eyebrow fluff patch bit were the eyes.
I have 3 Rottweilers, 2 German shepherds and 6 not going to grow cookle spaniel
Nice channel.  Rots are so beautiful when young
Beauty
I think Meatball likes his new friend.
Cutesness overload
John 1:9 Be strong and courageous and Jesus  is coming
Awww he’s so cuteee 🥺🥺🥺
he looks like chop
When do Rottweilers develop the happy growl?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😭😭
💕💕💕💯💕💓❤️❤️😘😘♥️♥️💯😍😍🥰😭😭🙏🙏😍😍💗💗💯💯💕💕💓
"How you doin' chop?"
Makes me wonder if banks handed me out all those candies when I was a kid going in there with mom just to get me used to the idea of going in there later to leave them with my money.
yeah they are adorable when they are a small puppy 🐶 but when them rottweiler grow up and get big I don't wanna be near them demonic dogs from the gates of hell in the words of Ariana grande herself my reaction is like thank you next I'm gone 🤨😒 💨🙅‍♀️
I Like dog.
😘😘😍😍😙😙😍😍
Gorgeous boy 👍
Beautiful ROTTIE PUPPY.
I Love dat a dog name is meatball i Love it
baby🥺
What a fucking angel.
He looks like my Rottweiler when she was a puppy
Rottweilers with tails are so cute it's uncommon but when they do have a tail they are extra cute
Ermagherd.....i would die for bronson!! How much of a cutie is this pupper!! 🤩💛🤩
I have one but 1 years okd
Yeah!! Tail👌 Good
Aw! Bronson is cute and did so well 🧡🧡🧡🧡
I will never get why dogs have cologne sprayed on them even if it's mild I assume... I'm super scent sensitive and I'm not even a dog. Can't imagine how this must be like for them. Also they gain so much information through scents, it must be very distracting to have your own weird scent you can't get away from...
He is georgous
❤️
Where does one get said blueberry cologne…. For uhhh dog use.
JUST. SO. CUTE!!!
3 months?! What are they feeding these puppers? Is The Rock sharing his lunch with them to beef them up? 😂
Wish my man wore blueberry cologne…
Bronson my love YOU ARE SOOO gosh darn good looking! Handsome, young & sweet a total chick magnet 🐾💋
Bronson the handsome
That’s my name
Милота
Love love love!
CATS PLEASE?? ❤️❤️
adorable big baby
Μπραβοοοοοοο
SO CUTEEEEE
😍😍
What a good boy
a Rottweiler that smells like Blueberries ......what a twist!
Bronson is such a good boy! 😙 He took his whole first grooming appointment like a champ and came out of it looking handsome and adorable all at the same time! It was really cute when he gave you kisses as you towelled him dry. 🥰 I also liked that you gave him treats to encourage positive reinforcement with the blow-dryer and while clipping his nails. 👍 He's gonna be an excellent spokes-dog for his breed so sure. 🐶
Me as a dog😌
Blue berry cologne. Lol
This is bullshit!
Brandon is so cute and very clean too !!!
What a beauty!
☺️💖
Baby Chop
Omfg so cute!!!
Why are you wearing the stupid face diaper? You do realize the slave muzzles don't stop a virus right? Oh and that the " vaccine " isn't really a vaccine. Wake up Dumbasses...

Aaaaaaw he's so cute!
My Vet recommended not to use Blow-dry, she reckons it gives pet Arthritis
They’re one of my favorite breeds. I love their little eyebrows
4 months or  4 weeks?
I love the name Meatball
They paid to groom a dog like that.
Thank you for the amazing video :)

I would die for Bronson.
Meatball !!!
He's beautiful 🤩🤩🤩
WHAT A HANDSOME GOOD LIL BOI
Just amazing.
He is one gorgeous rotty
you are amazingly thorough and gentle.
It is so annoying when people say that Rottweilers and pit bulls are bad dogs. They are only mean because some of them have had a really bad upbringing
We have a naughty 5 month old puppy that looks exactly like this cute Bronson. Ours is not rottweiler, we don't know what he is because we just adopted him and the person we adopted him from doesn't know his breed either, probably a cross breed. Nevertheless, their eyebrows are the cutest thing ever.
Baby chop
Bronson is very sweet and yes he did great to his first time
Meatball  is such a cute name
Explain your smolness Rottweiler Rottweiler: *am p o t a t*
OMG HE IS SO PRECIOUS 🥺
I have A sneaky suspicion is that little fella is going to be plenty mischievous when he gets older that’s OK that’s the good ones see you there before they can really be considered a good dog they got to be bad first and they keep working on it to make sure they got that mist of part just right anyway this is a Jim mungai from Kennerdell a Pennsylvania I love animals like that and I like the lady who obviously takes very very good care of that dog do you have a good time with that little fella
Psí salon pěkné.😀
Awww
“And now it’s time to get dirty playing with Meatball”
So cute!!!
That is one beautiful little man! 🤎
I'm sooo HANDSOME: Treats PLEASE!! 🥰🥰🤗 deb in SC
This is so smart to start when they're young. It took a very long time to acclimate any of my adult rescues from terrified of nail trims and hair brushings to being relaxed, dozing and loving the high value treats afterwards.
Excellent 🍬 🧡🙏🏼
Good dog, Bronson.
I love the dogs name ! I’d like to have that name😊
Where are you located. I'd love to bring Charlie to you!
U better believe once travel becomes a little less scary because of COVID and the variant u better believe I’m making a trip down

People: "Rottweilers are SO aggressive and vicious!'  TheGirlWithTheDogs: Gets mauled by big, scary Rottweiler...kisses.   I'm pretty sure Rottweilers have the opposite of Napoleon Syndrome-they just want to be lap dogs and get the scritches and pets all day.

Karens: ROTTWEILERS ARE TERRIBLE AND VICIOUS DOGS!!!!!!! THEY WILL RIP  YOUR FACE OFF!!!!!!!!!!!  Bronson: hugs everyone because he’s afraid of a blow dryer  While some Rottweilers can be over-protective of their owners in some circumstances, They are some of the cutest dogs in the world. There are no bad dogs, only bad owners.
Hi Face. You are beautiful.
Why don’t you use those methods for all the dogs

Do you just do boy dogs
Bronson is just beginning that lanky stage that all Rotties go through before they start to fill out. Is there any better looking pup than a Rottweiler?
Can you plz do a Pomeranian.
Day 1of asking girl with dogs do dogs fart 💨?
As a petco dog groomer, I wish we were able to use treats for puppies it’d make the process so much easier, we aren’t allowed to use any treats without the owner actually giving it to us.
Meatball is a suitable name for any pet when food supplies are lacking during war time
too cute
Aaawww! What a sweet pupper!
Omg the rottie has a tail😳 I've never seen one with a tail. 🥺
He is so cute
I would die for Bronson—

I’m sorry but MEATBALL THE PUG AGGHHHHHH ❤️ ❤️
This baby is SO CUTE  Just enforces me wanting one more
“And now it’s time to play with Meatball.” Or step on Meatball. Either way, he’s beyond adorable! Still, it’s funny how a baby Rottweiler is bigger than a full-grown pug.
I love all the techniques you used for positive reinforcement, this makes me so happy
❤️❤️❤️
The  Rockweiler puppy is so cute
I love him he's so cute
I love your videos 💜
Boi is so confused at first and just kisses her so cute
Are you from nc? I used to work at a place who had that dog meatball same breed and size
Can you do a another Rottweiler
I love your videos
He looks exactly like my granny's dog that passed away a while ago, I really liked her, she was cute, liked kisses and liked it when I played with her paws. I miss her 😭 but she gave birth to two babies before she left for heaven so now we have two little boys who look cute af too
Aw this makes me miss my Rottweiler mix. He's a little protective but he is honestly a gentle giant and very sweet like this puppy
Why is it called  dirty dog shampoo
Bronson is cutie
he’s so cute
What the youngest n oldest dog you've ever given a bath too What age should dog be before you take for a bath. Do you wash stray dogs.
So  cute dog
I guess you could say you use PAWSITIVE reinforcement
Rottweilers aren't scary. My neighbor's eats rocks and drinks from the flower pot.
God, I don't think I've ever seen a more handsome dog.
That is totally the perfect name for little meatball
So cute
He's so cuteeee

How long after a dog should bathed?
So sweet
I once had a dog named Bronson, he probably got out down by the pound after my mom abandoned him and his sister at a random park
Cute
Bronson after the treats: “Dryer? All I know is ✨treats✨”
what a good boy
He's such a handsome little guy! 😍
meatball, such a fitting name
I want a pup!
Bronson is ADORABLE
Everything's fun and games until he eats 'meatball'
How adorable he is❤️❤️❤️
His head is so big🥺
He's a lil cutie 🥰😍
Do you use different types of colonge on certain dog breeds? Or is it just a vibe when choosing the scent?
Meatball be lookin like a real meatball tho
PAWsitive reinforcement....
I wish my dog wasnt so unpredictably hostile, id love to be able to take him to a groomer to take care of the things im terrible at, but i get the job done i suppose. I keep him clean and comfortable since im the only one allowed all up in his space to bathe him lol
its meatball
I love him!!!
I LITTARLY STARTED CRYING OMG SO CUTE 🥺🥺🥺❤❤❤❤❤❤🥺🥺🥺🥺
My dog would bark and try to RUN from the blow dryer she is also a Rottweiler but she around 2 years old now
Awe i love rottweilers i have two :)
Aww
adorable ❤️
Some people: Rottweilers are dangerous! Bronson: *giving kisses*
Bronson is so cute!
Bronson: *sticks his tongue out* Me: Why is he so cute?!
Meatball is a perfect name for that pug.
I just wanna say              AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Aweee is so adorable 🥺💖
I love dogs with the eyebrow markinga
The baby
This is so cute!!
AWWW! HE'S SO CUTEEEEEE! I LITERALLY WANNA TAKE HIM HOMEEE 😆😆😆!
Omg sooo cute!
Adorable
He looks so soft ong
As someone who has family with a rottie, they are so sweet So stop saying they're aggressive. Dogs are an extention of their owners. How they are treated is reflected in their behavior. Our Rottweiler's name is Bruno, and the most he does to hurt you is knock you over bc he loves people and forgets how big he is. :)
HE'S SO CUTE I'M GONNA DIE CALL AN AMBULANCE 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭❤️
AWWWWWW
She's living my dream🥺
This reminds me of my most loved dog bubu :( he was so protective to me when I was a baby 😭
Aweeeeee he’s so cuteeeeee—
Ahhhhhh I love rottweilers!!! They're so stoic and adorable!!
Have you ever done a pitbull
MEATBALL potato 🥔
“Excited and just wants more treats” Me and this puppy are the same person
I have a question. How much does you grooming business cost?
My dog was traumatized at our local petsmart. The manager said they wouldn't groom her again because she tried to bite her, but apparently (I wasn't there, my mom went) our dog was visibly scared and barking at the manager. We give her baths at home and take her to a local groomer to get her nails clipped.
Some people often confuse my Border Collie for a Rottweiler beacause of his unusual colouring, but then they say, “oh of course he’s a Border Collie, he’s not aggressive!”  I really think people misunderstand Rottweilers
WHO'S A GOOD BOY
"And now it's time to play with meatball" I love meatball, he actually looks like a meatball aswell
Cutie!

Why don’t you use a nail grinder? All of my dogs have been dark dogs except for 3 and I was worried about hurting them
Can someone tell me where this dog grooming place is! My dogs are in dire need of grooming
What a great name for such a good boy!
He is so cute
I've never clicked liked so fast
Beautiful Puppy
He is so cute 🥰😍☺️🥺

GIMME DAT MEATBALL
Can we get a video with Meatball?
He's so CUTEEE! I own a 6 yr old rottweiler,And people say there terrifying but there actually big babies,(If you train them well)and they're good protection dogs,So I'd recommend getting one if you can handle training them!😅
i want one
Can the owners still give them a bath at home? Even though they bring them to appointments?
American or German Rottweiler
I know pugs are ugly and gross so its quite fitting but even I wouldn't name one meatball
My dog isn’t dangerous or mean in any type of way he’s just retarted and tries to eat everything and he’s like 1 yo
He’s so beautiful 🤩
so cute <3
He looks like a very good boy
Rottie puppies are so adorable 😭
He is so cute!
Do you do Great Danes?
He is literally adorable
Bro I used to have a pug named meatball to!!
Not to be dramatic or anything but I would die for Bronson
I find it so cute when he's entirely soapy except for his little fluffy head, its really adorable
He his so stinking adorable! Definitely one of the perks of being a groomer. 😍
He’s beautiful
Who knew Rottweiler pups so sweet & cute...don't u just wanna hug that mug💕💞💕💞💕💞
I would die for Bronson-
My bestie has King Rottweiler (is it called that? I’m from Germany and her he’s called is a Königs Rottweiler)  (I say we in this story bcs I also know him and he’s like my dog too)  We  got him when he was only 3 months old (yes, little froggy clumsy bcs of his big paws) and he was such a cutie  But know, 1 1/2 years olds  He’s even cuter, when he’s excited he likes to jump at ppl to give kisses (but he’s already on behind legs 160cm) we keep him in his House when small ppl or ppl who are afraid of big dogs come to visit. He cries then  bcs he loves to meet new ppl and wants to play at day but at night he just cuddles with you, he’s just a big, warm and fluffy bear. We love him all deeply, he’s such a good boy and listens very well.    The sweetest part abt him is that whenever he sees someone crying he licks they’re faces and just lays down, almost waiting for them too cuddle with him. I love him deeply, I suffer from depression he helps me a lot and he makes me really happy.
Bronso: Eat Meatball  Everyone else at the vet: **HOLY SH-**
OH MY GOD HES SO PRECIOUS
Bronson is so cute and he looks like my dog except smaller and a different breed
I want a doggie 🐶😩
He's Soooo cute
Bronson is perfect
How cute is he!!!  Omg
I want that dog 🥺🥺
*MEAT BALL*
SO CUTE
AWWWW
I wonder if you can do a corgi?
Sooo cute
Aw Bronson Is adorable as heck!! Rotwhilers can be very sweet dogs but I’ve had a bad experience with one once :/ hope he’s doing better now. He was in an aggressive environment at home and ended up getting out of his yard and killed our neighbors small yorkie, the dog would’ve lived but his owners put the injured dog in a bucket and let it die and her owners found her the next day :( it was very sad. Please don’t keep a dog if you’re not going to teach it to not be aggressive
Omg I cant stop smiling
My question is dose this girl gave a dog??
Love the way he just let's her make him more handsome 💙 and gives her those sweet 💕
I LOVE HIM
Where is ur grooming store?
Meatball with four feet 😆
Ahh meatball the go to playing pug
Such a good boy!
Ok everybody, on 3!   1, 2, 3:  awwwwwwww
I need to get some blueberry cologne, for myself.
Please do a shih tzu
So so cute and funny and smart dog
awwww
This was absolutely cute
Why that puppy is so big tho-
Give me the babby
That's not what positive reinforcement is
Sorry but i can't work at your shop i wouldn't be able to give them back
this was so cute! we had a rottweiler when i was growing up, he was such a perfect little man. rotties never lose that puppy energy! <3 we live on a big property with farm animals ‘n such, so he had lots of room to run around and cause havoc lol. there will always be a special place in my heart for rottweilers and big dogs<3
do dogs that start being groomed as puppies handle grooming later in life better than dogs that come in for the first time as adults? i imagine it’s like socializing them with other dogs and new people, the sooner the better?
He is sooooooo cute!!!!!💕💕💕
love ur voice
What a beautiful dog
Rottweilers are awesome! I have two they are one of the best dog breeds. They are really good family dogs if you actually train them.
MEATBALLLLLL
Where do u work

Bronson is a badass name for a rot
Some people: big dogs are dangerous and scary! Big dogs:
Is this job fun I would love to do that
Rots are so beautiful!!
The dog reminds me of our family pet, Bobby. He's also a rottweiler but probably mixed with a labrador. He's the sweetest dog ever, gives loads of kisses, has the cutest face, and he never has an intention to bite or harm us.  He's 12 years old and his health isn't good. We tried everything to help him but i guess this just how life is... I'm gonna miss him when he's gone. ❤️
oh my GODS bronson is so CUTE
THE CUTESSTTT ❤️❤️❤️
OH MY GOD HES ADORABLE
This just makes me want a Rottweiler more🥰
Can u do dachshund?

d:

I'm so happy to see a rottie with it's ears an tail properly intact! Such a good boy, and responsible pet owners!
Meatball though. Plot twist the person was eating spaghetti with meatballs and said i really love meat balls! And the next day he got a pug he did not know what to name it so hes like. hm. I like meat balls I should name him meatball!!

Omg so cute gemmee

CAN YOU PLEASE DO A MASTIFF!!! PLEEEEAAAAASSSSEEEE!!!!💖💖💖
Awww he’s so cuteeeeee
My 8 year old dog has always HATED getting his nails done, me and my husband used to have to pin him down to do them. When we got our girl dog, I started doing positive reinforcement with treats while doing nails and our older dog got veeerrrry interested in the fact that she was getting nonstop treats lol. We also taught them to boop the clippers with their nose for treats so whenever they see the clippers, they get super excited for getting their nails done lol. I’m proud of my older boy because he was probably 6 years old before this happened for him.
Gurl Where do you get that Colone?!
what a polite young man
I want to cuddle bronson
I want to squish him . . .
Genuine puppy-dog eyes. 😁

You know a pup was given lots of treats when instead of freaking out about being groomed, the pup’s just looking around going “hey, where’d treat person go? D=”
Him: im here for the treats
The puppy is so cute it’s funny how all they want is treats
Wish my dog was that go at bath time
Rottweilers can be such softies compared to their reputation as a more aggressive or standoffish breed. Known a few in my time: There was one who was a family dog, who lived down the road from my now deceased grandma, and according to her, she would let the baby in the family ride around the whole house on her back :3 Also knew a pair owned by a body builder who ran a local gym, the way they’d just lark about and around all the gym equipment staring everyone down with the softest faces ever was adorable.
Branson is sooo cute and excitable! He's all "screw dryers and sprays, gimme treats!!" Adorable!😍😍😍
HEHEHE
Honestly how can people say some breeds are dangerous, Rottweilers are regarded as some of the fiercest guard dogs, but it's all in the nurture, just look at bronson cute little pupper wouldn't hurt a fly
Just a question do you have any tips for cutting black nails?
So precious!!
Blueberry Bronson! 😍

This hit close I had a Rottweiler named roxy as a kid as a puppy she ate rocks but later on we had to give her away because we couldn’t take proper care for her.
Can you do a cattle dog
Another misunderstood breed unfortunately. When they get attention and affection, they are extremely calm and loving with everyone. Amazing breed.
He has such a pretty face!
Awww 🥰 the little tongue sticking out a little at the end 🥰
Meatball 🥺❤️

Oh they are precious
This is THE CUTEST PUPPY 😍
A chain collar or leash, really.
I have a fear of dogs but at the same time they are one of the cutest creatures on the planet
I really need to find a groomer for my mastiff/lab mix.  Unfortunately I never took him when he was younger/smaller and has never been fully groomed. He’s almost a year old and I have no idea how he will act if I try to take him somewhere, especially if he is around other people and other dogs. I also don’t know how he would react or behave about the grooming. He really needs it though.
I love rottweilers
That dog is probably like: _I don’t know why I am getting so many treats… BUT I LOVE IT!_
When I get a dong I’m naming it nezoko on the spot
Rottweilers are so cute.
Typical Rottweiler. Only had eyes for the treats!
So cutee, I love it
MEATBALL AWEE
What a freaking cutie pie!
He’s so cute, I can’t! I want one!
He looks so innocent
Meat ball🤔nice name
I gotta say     Adorable
Note put peanut butter on the wall and do the cleaning
Meatball🤣🤣🤣 i love it
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH MEATBALL☺️☺️☺️💜💜💜💜
I would die for Bronson
i have an english bulldog named Meatball!!
It's makes me so happy his ears aren't clipped😊
Could you do a mutt like a mix of different breeds it’s for my dog💕
I love rottweilers lol
I used to have one of these.. I was around 4 and her name was harley. She was a good dog but then.. my parents divorced and we had to get rid of her.. I miss her
So cute
AWWWW
He's so adorable and such a good puppy! 😍
Oh my god that’s so cute
He’s such a cute puppy. Too bad he grows up to be an ugly slobbering mess.
OH MY GLD HES SO CUTE LOOK AT HIS EYEBROWS
Are you sure dogs want "blueberry cologne"?
HE DID SO WELL. WHAT A GOOD BOY.
OMG!!! Bronson is the best name for a Rottweiler!!!
he looks so soft. so cute
Awe, puppy breath kisses are the sweetest kisses.😂
what a cutie 🥰
Omg so freaking cuuuuute 💕
Why does my dog have black in her ear and should I be worried :(
Rottweiler puppies are gorgeous
Hes so cute
He's so cUTE
This is adorable!! Now he's gonna expect treats though when there's drying and clipping. He's so cute!!
Doggo
He’s a happy boi.
My hair stylists should use positive reinforcements on me....I LIKE TREATS🙄
Due to a rottweiler attacking me as a child, I have always been uneasy about them...but of my goodness Bronson has changed my heart! What a sweet puppy!
"now, he doesn't even know the dryer exists."
MEATBALL OMG perfect name
Uh you mean Chop’s son?
SO CUTE WAHHHH
How do you choose what cologne you use
Awww meatball so cute😍😍😍😍😍  Mind: 😂That is defenetly my futurese dog name hhehehhe😂
He's big for a 4-month old
Awww! He’s so cute!!
I HAVE A DOG BRONSON AND HES A ROTTWEILER!
Dats my dream dog
Awwhhhh i need one now
Huh meatball😏
Meatball🤣
He is so adorable 🥰
I had a dog named meatball...😔
Do a Shiba inu
Hey that's my late name no joke
I love him! I'm too scared to get a puppy tho(I'm afraid of dogs 😅)
What the dog doing
aww he’s such a good boy :)
Bronson and meatball are both adorable!
i remember when i was little i had a rottweiler and a pug and they looked just like that lol
He's so cute 😊☺️
HE’S SO CUUUUUUUUUUTE
Her: he’s really exited and just wants some more treats. Me: THEN GIVE HIM DA TRMEATS UnU
Taking care of a live is so sensitive, and it's not like you only gave them food and a place a to stay it's much more than that, that's why I'm still not sure I can take responsibility of another live even though I like them so much❤️
He's too cute😭❤️ my heart burst when he gave her kisses
Meatball? Thats rude
That’s one cute pup
Bronson looks so handsome
OMG THE PUGS NAME IS MEATBALL-
It looks like he has little eyebrowssss it's so cuteee!!! 😂😂💖💖💖
he’s like so no more treats
I love his little circle eyebrows they are so cute!
I hate how people always assume that Rottweilers are always mean, most of the ones I’ve met are some of the sweetest dogs ever. A dog isn’t born mean, it’s raised to be mean.
I have never seen a rottweiler puppy they are the most adorable thing I've ever seen
My uncles gf has a Rottweiler and while he can be loud, he is the best dog in the world for tug of war. I remember him being a tiny puppy and now he is a full adult
Awwwwweee
im dognapping this dog hes so cute and amazing and my god i just need him-
Aw i used to have a rottweiler she used to have problems but she was a good dog
rottweiler puppies are so adorable bro. then they grow up and theyre still adorable, but slightly more terrifying
My dog is about a year old, and he’s half husky, 25% boxer and 25% lab. He’s got a lot of hair, and the texture is definitely from the husky side. He’s never been groomed professionally before but I keep telling my dad we should do it because his hair is getting too long and his paw pads are really rough. But he’s also a rescue and gets nervous very very easily so I’m not sure if we should really do it.
The freakin cutest! Bronson and Meatball. I love it! 🤗
HE'S SO CYUTE :((
Love this short... u r truly made for this career... well done and blueberry cologne was a good idea...
He looks like my 3 month old Rottweiler puppy
Ohhh he is adorable!!! My fav #Rotties
‘Hes really excited and just wants more treats’ same bronson
GIVE HIM MORE TREATS!!!!
Bronson and Meatball, gorgeous friends!!! 🐾🐾🐾🐾🐶🐶🐶🐶💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
0:22 Ahh the "treats" method. An oldie but a goodie
Ok how do I get an appointment with dis lady cos my doggos need a grooming
Didn't know it was pronounced as 'rot•y•ler' NOT 'rot•whee•ler'.
That was fast!
"Grown woman GROOMS 4 month old boy"
Look at da little pupper face 😍🐶
I hate when people try to tell me how bad Rottweilers are and I’m sitting there thinking of my uncles rott(rip), who never bit someone in his life, trying not to smack them and tell them to shut up.
CUTE
AJAHSJHDJFKDJDK HES SO CUTE 🥺
He’ so cute
I have just Rottweiler puppy dog
Tik tok new tts voice?
He was beautiful…
Bronson is so cute omg I'ma doe of cuteness
He’s such a large puppy
I had a dog exactly like this he was still a puppy his name was Baxter but he died😕
He's so So Adorable and having him get Grooms at a really young age is great because he'll see it as normal and be so used to it as he gets older and I thought he did really well for his first appointment
I love the cologne names
awwwww
So cute
Can you do a Mastiff?
Theyre just so cute 🥺😭
My dad told me to get a Rottweiler if I wanted a dog in the future, first I wanted a husky but now I’ve fallen in love ;-;
He is so CUUUUUUUUUTE
He looks so cute with the ear protection this on aww😍✋
I still don’t get why y’all spray the dogs with cologne, unless it’s very subtle
FACT NOT NEEDED ABOUT MY DOG!! ROCKY!   He is a Rottweiler German shepherd mix his is a big bear with FLOOF and will not bork at you but love you instead!
Sooo flooofy 🥰
I just realized the irony of using blueberry cologne on a dog.
He’s going to be massive
Can we just appreciate the pugs name,  now I ever get a pug I’m naming them meatball
he’s so adorable!
"after his bath I towel him dry and he gives me a lot of kisses" literally sounds like Phineas and Ferb song
Omg meatball and bronson are to cute🤩🥺
All I was thinking was Aww aww aww aww aww Awwww
Chop looking hella fresh
Soooo adorabllllllllllllle ❤️
Meatball actually looks like a meatball. So cute

Dog stats: Still a lil boy Has alot of energy Gives alot of kisses  And thats all folks!
Thats a very handsome rottweiler. Im not really a rottweiler guy because well...... my pack is literally all huskies 😂 but i know a good lookin dog when i see one 😂
bronson looks just like my rottie when he was a baby, can’t believe he’s turning 7 this year 🥰

So cute!
So cute
Meatball is so cute 😭
A pug named meatball. I need that.
OMG HES SO CUTE
SHERIFF BRONSON STONE. If you get this reference, we can be friends
Meatball!!!!!!
I didnt watch the video to the end at first and was very confused to why Bronson is playing with a Meatball
They are very cute dogs
The ww2 documentary imo
I want one ☝️
Awwww 🥺🥺🥺
My favorite parts of her videos is when she is all done and put doggie cologne with a cute name.
First off, what a sweet lil puppy! Wish we had done more positive reinforcement when our dogs were puppies. Second, he looked like he should have got the jelly bean cologne cause he looks like a lil jelly bean. Finally, that is the BEST name for a pug I’ve ever heard!!! 🤣🤣
🥰 beautiful doggies.
Rottweilers and golden retrievers have such cute faces I mean all dogs do but 🥺🥺🥺
He looks so fluffy and soft.
🥺I want a Rottweiler so bad.
It’s weird seeing a Rottweiler with a tail, at 4 months
This is a good thing to get them used to pet grooming young so they are calm and not scared later on
Adorable!!!
Oh my gosh he is so cute
So Handsome
"rottweilers are so evil!" rottweilers:
Sorry, but roughly how much do you get paid as a pet groomer??
Soo cute.
I’d happily die for Bronson.
Omg he is so cute I want a Rottweiler and Pitbull
THE PUG'S NAME IS MEATBALL 🥺
Your such a wonderful sweet person and all the fur babies  can sense that. Great job 😎
HES SO CUTE
i have to stick a spoon full of peanut butter out of the side of my mouth and hold it with my teeth to get my rottie moose to let me clip and file his nails 😂
IMHO I think Bronson was more of a jelly bean cologne kinda guy. He’s sooo cute!
Omg such a sweet little Boo-bear 😭😭💖💖💖💖
bronson sounds like the most rottweiler name ever lol
I would do anything for a pal like Meatball. 🥺
Bro that dog could take my arm off and instead of getting mad I would be proud that he has that kinda strength
He looks just like my dog, Thor He's a mix of Labrador and Rottweiler
I have a puppy who plays a little ruff and he never stops playing. Ever. So I decided if I can't pet him I'll blow on his face. He still thinks it's an invisible hand that moves to fast to be caught.
He is so cute. 😍
L O O K A T T H E E Y E E E S
Seriously. WHO IS MEATBALL. 😭😍
It's weird how they use the "positive reinforcement" with the puppies but don't with the bigger dogs. And then wonder why the doggos snap?!
I love the names that these owners give their dogs lmao.
Where are you located? I want to bring my floof and floppy to be groomed by you!!!
Pawsitive reinforcement
I love Rottweilers

I was just watching this with my cousin in my bed (he was eatching something else) and then this lady said “now He’s ready for the blowdryer” and then my cousin was like “now He’s ready for the blow***” and I bursted out laughing 😅😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bronson is a Good Boy!
all your video are great. but what really caught my eye is the head towel you use during drying. what is it called and where can i get for my dogs?
Bronson is *not* a dirty dog. HE IS BABY.
If I‘ll ever be rich I‘ll adopt 2 dogs and give them the best life that they deserve
No joke I would die for Bronson
What an absolute good boy 😍😍😍
He’s adorable  And meatball lol 😂

Meatball is literally the best name fore a pug
omg we tried blow drying out dog at home and omg he fought for his life to get away😭 he was screaming and yelping 😩… to be fair he’s scared of everything but he acts like he’s a big boy… he’ll be 2 this month
I usually don't like Rottweiler but he's a cutie
ok meatball is like the best name for a pug tho
Yeees gals
Dude “Meatball” hahaha
So cuuuuuutw!
My dog was also a rottweiler :( sadly he died she was super loud when barking but such a gentle giant rip Richard 😔
Aww that’s cute ☺️
What a sweet little puppo 🐶
I love Bronson :(
Good boy ..you did awesome
Sorry if I'm rude, but i see Meatball as Fatball just because of it's color
I love how everything is just for playing with meatball and its cute
I would die for Bronson
Honestly I really hope this makes it to the people who think that Rottweilers are aggressive by nature and are willing to harm anything that gets to close, all dogs are born sort of nutrural to everything but if any dog is shown love and affection by day one and that love keeps going for the rest of its life then it won't be aggressive and this goes for even Rottweilers, the only logical reason I can think of as to why this breed of dog has a bad reputation with society is because most of these dogs are trained to either fight or to be guard dogs which is incredibly unfair to the dog because its basically devoting its whole life for either the amusement of humans or to be a barking, aggressive and unfriendly dog to "defend" their owners.
Meatball reminds me of my daisy, she’s a chihuahua mix, she’s about 15 and looks like a meatloaf or a potato
Cuteness overload 😍
I can smell puppy breath
What a cutie patootie!!!! 🥰😍
I had a dog name brownson
Cute puppers
a pug A PUG NAMED MEATBALL😭💕💕
Bronson’s having the time of his life with those treats 😂
Bronson,  wow. He is soooo cute and well behaved. The groomer and assistant are amazing.
istg why do people think all pitbulls and rottweilers are bad :( they're all so adorable and its just how the dickheads they have for owners treat/train them :((
I want it  I need it  It’s adorable
Yes, stating the obvious.... Bronson is adorable.
So... adorable
Meatball is the most appropriate name for a pugg
Nothing scarier than clipping dog nails
Wait, the Pug's name is _Meatball_ ? Why?
I love Bronson already.
The pugs name being meatball is just adorable to me 😭
"OH MY GOODNESS GRACIEOUS-HOLY MOLY-WHAT IN CARNATION-oo food o♡o"
Not to be dramatic but I would die for this dog
Great groom job...Bronson did great for his 1st time.  Hope the owners bring him back for more grooms~so he will grow up loving his visits👍
The good boye, smol, precious. Protecc and cherish
Just take my money and we don’t have to do this the hard way
Good puppy 💗
He soooo cute
AAAAAAAAAW
Adorable.  He did great. Ladies did too!!
I wub bronsonn
Cute rottie puppy 😎💪
Bronson is a gorgeous little boy
Blueberry cologne.. Because Why would you want your dog to smell like a dog.. Treat your dog like a dog, not a thing.
How do you know when to stop cutting a dog nails when the nails are black?
A Rottie named Bronson has got a gangsta feeling to it.
AWWWWW SO CUTE!
I wanna hug Bronson. Period.
"Dirty dog" shampoo.. As opposed to the shampoo you would use on a clean dog?
“Meatball” I just have a soft spot for pugs and their messed up noses because of DanTDM.
What's with all the dislikes  If you don't have heart just don't watch moron
He just wants tweets!!
I love him. He is a good boy
Do you ever groom beagles?
Meatball...I pmsl when I heard that, cracking name
Knowing a Pug is named Meatball is pretty dang funny.
AWEE! he's such a sweetie!!
Hes so handsome☺
He is soooo cute  I can eat him up ♥️♥️😋😋😋😋
He’s In love with treats lol
Aww he's simply adorable!!
Can I please snuggle with him 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Can I just mention how good of a name Meatball is for a Pug?
Meatball?! Oh god everything in this vid is so cute
Dude, imagine someone giving you snacks while they give you a bath, we like to think that we are the owners of dogs but something tells me its the other way around XD
He's so cute!!!!!!!!!
Funfact: most dogs have cute, round eyebrows
bronson just might be the cutest puppy i’ve ever seen
Now I want a Rottweiler
Look at him.. he doesn't have a thought behind those eyes.
He's so cute
I cracked when she introduced us to "meatball."
I love how puppies have that “thick” body type 😭  it’s so cute
thank you for reminding me how much i absolutely love rotties <3
I want more of Meatball
😍😍😍😍😍😍
This is a dog. I’m gonna cut his fur. He’s cute. Bye.
She grew an extra two arms and became the demigod of dog grooming
He looks my my root whiler
He has such big paws! I know this brief of dog can be scary if not trained right but I hate that some people think they are all bad and mean. This dude is a little baby angel.
This is one of the cutest puppies I’ve ever seen.
Bronson at 4 months is going to be huge lol
Aww
Cute puppy.
I would be so afraid of this rottweiler. You are a brave woman 💓
Omg he is huge
He's so ADORABLE!!
He’s so cute. What a handsome guy!
Look how gorgeous and perfect he looks!
For this puppyI feel what people call... love
He is sooooo cute and sweet 🥺 just wanted to give kisses
Oh my god his little head tilt/tongue poking out after the blueberry cologne is heart melting
Bronson is absolutely massive!!! I love it.
Aaaaaawwwwwww. He's just the best boy.
This is youtube not tik tok, get this bullshit the fuck out of here
*Bronson after the groom:* _“Mi mas kis dis leydi.”_
Bronson I’m in love with you. You’ve tugged so hard on my heart strings I’m yours forever.
I love rotties theyre so cuuuute
Yeah, my doggo is the same. It’s just changing what they’re focused on. We used to give our dog her kong with peanut butter in it and she would never let me clip her nails. Now, she sits and waits
OMG HE SO CUTE!
He is so handsome but the chain collar and lead really annoyed me 😅😰
Omg he’s the cutest
He's fucking beautiful
I love that they didn't dock his tail!
Meatball doen't want to play, he wants to smell that blueberry cologne.
Hey Bronson & Meatball🐶😍
Omg he's so beautiful
I can’t even describe how much I wanna talk to this little guy in a baby voice and cuddle him
0:07 When my rottweiler puppy was 4 months old he was bigger
What a cutie..
MEATBALL
Bronson the handsome
He's so cute
He is adorable! I’d be arrested for puppy-napping!
He's so cute😍
So nice to see a rottweiler with a long tail!
I wish I could bring u my pups lo
Meatball is THE perfect name for a pug
Bronson is extremely cute but Meatball 🥺
Cute puppy, videos like this make me want a new puppy, haven’t had a dog for a few years now.
Bronson is so adorable 💜💜💜

I have a dog like that but sliver and brown and named Blue and gives alot of trouble
Blueberry cologne :o
You are so good at this!! I admire your work
Omg such a cute and good boi 😍
My favourite part of the city was at the very end where the other dogs introduced and the other dogs name is meatball
Meatball the MVP.
And now it's time to get dirty again.
I have a Rottweiler ,now she is a big girl . She is also very cute and strong
923 down voted? Really?
BRONSON IS FUCKING ADORABLE!!!!
It's a DOGGY SPA DAY, get it right!
SO CUTEEEE!!!
I love Rottweilers. They are my favorite dog
Adorable 🥰
I feel for dogs they walk in like so calm but know what's coming yet unlike cats just except defeat. My cat would be like no and a big hissy fit then revenge on me then the nearest window he would be see ya later dad don't sleep tonight. Trust me dogs are calmer than cats. Cats are smarter than dogs but not as calm
Awww Bronson is gorgeous!
Rottweilers are great
He’s such a good boy
Soo cute
whoever named that pug "meatball", god bless 😭
I need some advice, I have a huge sweet baby boy of a Rottie who is really well tempered usually, just a spoiled brat and a coward. He’s nearing the time of not being a puppy anymore and he’s absolutely huge for a dog his age. Did I mention that he’s an outside dog? He isn’t potty trained or anything though he certainly has the brains to be, but every time I try to wash him he runs off and I’ve been considering attempting to train him albeit a little late to be suited for inside, if only for a little bit, just enough to give him a bath and let him relax on colder or hotter days. I have this exact same issue with his older brother, who’s a pit mutt and very hyper. I honestly don’t know where to start, could I have some advice?
Look at this young distinguished little gentleman
Omg this puppy is so darn cute 🥺
I like this videos in general, but I'd be lying if I didn't say that what I like the most is the emphasis she puts en the "sh" in finished
💕👍
PAWSitive reinforcement 🐶
My Italian mother would scold me if I played with my meatball.
I love him he's so cute 😍
I'd pay good money to get to play with Meatball
Wow, you did so good with him. Beautiful coat.
I LOVE HIM 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
You bribed him, how dare you 🤣🤣
Big puppy
Oh my goodness!!! 😍 what a gorgeous puppy!! 💖🐶💖
I hate a rottie puppy but we didnt know that the ppl who gave us her she was too young and she died of parvo :(
Now that is one dapper puppy
We love PAWSITIVE reinforcement! Cute video!!
Awww such a handsome little baby rottie 😍
Everyone in the comments talks about the playing with Meatball, but can we just take a moment to appreciate how Bronson gives her kisses, that's so sweet
So that's how to get a dog to bite off your other arm...
Wait did he grow to like twice his original size during his appointment?!?
treats.....treats... give me more ..... :D
Pubby good.......want to pet pubby
Most puppies are cute, I know, but I think Rotty pups might be the cutest. Tiny little eyes in their big heads, nice symmetrical markings, highly affectionate and friendly. There's a lot to love, they're just adorable.
I love Rottweiler eyebrows
M E A T B A L L
Omg he is so beautiful and cute
More meatball please!
When is this very handsome fella coming back?
When she said meatball I was shocked at first because my aunt has a bulldog named meatball, but I realized it was a pug he was playing with. Great video anyway! 🥰
blueberry cologne :)
I love the every single dog looks like a granny after wearing the happy hoodie 😂
i have a rottie as well his name is roman
Please tell me Covid hasn't delayed the filming of Bronson and Meatball series! 😝
She is really good at commentary.  She has a funny story for every client.  Great job!
Bronson is da cutest! 😍
Bronson owners couldn't spend the time to wash and bond with their own puppy?  Do they send their kids to be washed at the "human groomers?"
Who disliked this !!!??? 😤😡
Handsome boy
Meatball is a great name for a pug.
I LOVE HIM 😭💖
I nEED MORE MEATBALL IMMEDIATELY
I don’t wanna know how much that treatment costs😂😂😂
that's such a cutie 😍
He deserves all the nom noms 😍
It's always time to play with Meatball, if we're being real.
And now it’s time to play with meatball 😂😂
Meatball…  The perfect name for a puglet
Bronson is so handsome 😍
I knew I had heard the name meatball before it's a stunning dogname
Rotties are the best🤩🤩🤩🤩
Bronson's absolutely delightful!
i dont get the cologne part... just why ?
Time to play with meatball 😂.. this girl is a trip
He is so super cute😊😊😘
Puppy kisses are the best!
Meatball: loving the name :D
I am glad people have stopped altering their dogs. Who knew that rottweiler's had such long tails!? Very cute.
Meatless bolls 🤣🤣🤣
How the fuck can you dislike this video?
you sound like a robot
I need a Bronson puppy!♥️♥️♥️😘😘😘
Meatball!! What a great name.
Sweetie baby aww
Why am I binging your videos
ok why is your voice so calming and why is he soo fluffy?!!
Look at those feets!
Him such a good boy
Funniest thing when I was kid, our neighbor had a huge ass rottie, Barrett, really sweet dog when he took him out on walks.    Barrett's signature move to get pets/attention was to sit on all 4's on your foot and lean against you, then look up with the sad eyes.
Awwwww 😍😍😍😍.  He is soooo adorable
He's a good boy
She saws off his paw.   Rottweiler puppy. Hmm treats.....
cuuuuuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Sorry but the rottweiler is she not he but still cute
Look at this pumpkin!🥰
ROTTIES!!! 💞🥺🥰😍✨
Gj Bronson I know a fighting game player just like you
Such a little cutie ❤❤
Bronson has that "my entire life is in front of me" look
Bronson's nickname should be Action
Good to see Franklin’s chop when he was a puppy.
Such a cute pup.
He’s adorable!
Is Melvin dead or what?
So precious ❤️
My favorite dog was a rottie.. beauitiful well mannered and not at all bad tempered... he is a great loss to our family when he passed away at a ripe old age...
Such a good boi 🥺🥲
Excellent cameo by meatball 🧆.
I need to cuddle that puppy
aww❤️ i REALLY love to see that Bronsons breeder kept his tail on his litter. in the 90s i bread the Rottweiler n every one of my littera were docked n declawed. ita one of my biggest regrets, n i. wish id never done something so horrible. id never do that again. my son researched it n unbeknownst to me.. the tail is absolutely a part of their spine smdh so ultimately... i removed parts of the spines of numerous litters💔😢 smh i really wish i knew better back then, this is heartbreaking to even txt about. im ashamed of myself for not knowing better. what kinda breeder was i?!! 💔 smdh terrible. id never do it again. n im glad to see ppl stopped having it done. hes beautiful ❤️😊xox
;^; He's so handsome..!
almost forgot to watch this today
Lol 😂 the pugs name is meatball very fitting 😍
What’s the point of going to the groomer with a little guy like that?
He's so cuteeee 🥺
Meatball did look like a meatball
I'm having a really tough week (living that chronic illness life, woo!) and I've probably watched this video a dozen times this week alone. I love Bronson so much, would love an updated video with him now that he's older if you still groom him.
Oh what a darling! I love Rotties!
Philadelphia are specifically targetting dog videos to advertise on lol
Happy to see he stil got his tail. And not cut off because owner like looks of it
Bronson is adorable - can't wait to see him for his next appointment.
Amazing to think he will grow into a vicious kissing machine
dis ain't ova
Goes in weighing 12 pounds comes out 15 pounds with all the treats given to him 😂 Beautiful little pup
The pug called Meatball brings me infinite joy
Who ever thinks puppies are not cute must have no soul
How this mammoth is 4 months old?
Cute boi
I love how rottweiler puppies have a ''extroverted and athletic kid that bullies the quiet/shy kids'' face, what a tough big boi
I wanna play with meatball!
Awwwwwwwww I love him!!!!!
So gorgeous
And Bronson is adorable.
Rotweilers are a gods gift. All dogs and animals are but rotweilers and all the dogs that usually dont get a chance will always hold a special spot in my heart.
I love how you put him in a snood to protect his ears during the blow-dry
Of course his names Bronson
The very idea of a pug named Meatball plodding around this Earth makes me a happy dude.
Awww, look at that little cupcake...ready to maul the neighbor's kids.
I miss my Rottweiler.
(Media) Rottweiler a vicious breed with a bite force of 300 lbs and a vicious temperament....  My rottweiler sleeping in the small bed because the teacup chihuahua was mean to her, afraid of thunder, her farts scare her and wakes her up, afraid of stairs, very social, maybe a little to social (nothing like a 90 pound dog running at strangers to scare them), if anyone is entering my house she hides in the laundry room or if I'm home finds where I am, does not like tap water has to come out a bottle (usually I get tap water and put in in a bottle), food has to be slightly wet (to hard for the baby)  But she my baby....
Does the collar you use while you shower them hurt them??? I don’t think it does but if it did it would be rly saddddd
Those kisses were bribes, he heard the huskies and got worried
Not to be dramatic but I would die for Bronson
Tell me more about meatball
See you had me with the puppet but then I saw the chunky pug and I need him now.
After coming from Fido the Husky this dog is very well behaved
Something about this calm matter of fact voice saying “and now it’s time to play with meatball” made me absolutely lose it
This is therapy
Look at the size of his paws!  He's gonna be a horse by the time he's done growing!
I don't know how you do it, I'd wanna steal just about every dog that comes through that door
Rottweilers are fight dogs!! They are dangerous!!! I think Bronson missed that note.
what a sweetheart. I had a rottie growing up, and positive attention definitely got us kisses.
Such a good boy
O M G !
A very good boy
Such a handsome boi, Bronson
so r we not gonna talk abt the fact he has lil eyebrows
what a handsome little puppy
I grew up around six rottweilers, I can't wait till I have my own.
NOW IT'S TIME TO PLAY WITH MEATBALL!!!
Too cute! 🥰😍
NOO STOP GROOMING THAT MINOR NOOOOO
Remember this is how good boys and good girls get ready to become a good boy or girl each day or week
Meatball shouldve been named choncc

Lil' Chop
Hello everyone this is your daily dose of girl with the dogs.
HE IS GORGEOUS!!!!!!

You should not wash dogs 😂
You use cologne on a dog?? The human race is really whit out saving🙄😅
I kept thinking “oooh, tiny puppy” because of the baby face, and then the groomer would come into the frame and I’d realize how huge the puppy really is. Wowza.
Awww this pupper is Soo cute!
Not to be dramatic but I would die for Bronson
Awwwwwwwww it's adorable!!!! He's so chubby ! 😍😍😍😍
So cute!

Hi guys i live in 1000sq ft apartment, can i get a german shepherd or rottweiler for that area?
He's a Goodboy!
Meatball fits the dog perfect lol 👌
Yep, if you do this as a puppy, they grow up enjoying the groomers since they quickly learn how fun it is and learn not to fear things like the dryer and vacuum.
I want one like this awww
I just lost my rottweiler today...YouTube recommendations, why you gotta pull my heart strings like this??
I love it when i get to play with my balls at the end of an appointment.

When I saw your husky one who hates nail Clippers I remember pugs are the same and at times over dramatize screams
Spraying dogs with cologne is sad. Like they wanna smell that bullshit the whole day.
I like pugs but most people think it’s my favorite dog Breed but it’s really a Rottweiler. I used to have one but now we don’t have her she still alive but has a different owner now I still get vary sad but I guess she has a good  home they have another dog so I think she likes it there better then when she was with us
HE'S GORGEOUS
How can people dislike these videos. I don’t understand
He’s so cute!!! 🥺🥺🥺
MEATBALL AND ITS A PUG I LOVE PEOPLE SOMETIMES
I find it very appropriate to name your pug with "meatball"
I thought Rottweiler’s could kill I was wrong
why the fuck do you put cologne on a dog? that's the dumbest shit I've seen today
I’ve always loved Rottweilers because they look like they have little eyebrows
Omg hes so handsome
❤️Love the positive reinforcement. Way more people in the animal or even human world need to do this and the fact they don't is just so sad. The lack of education 🙄😒
“And now it’s time to play with meatball” so cute😂
Such a handsome fella 🥰
Awwwwwwwwwwwweeeeeeeeeeeeeeee look at that precious little prince!
Aww Bronson looks so cute.
Love ❤️ Rottweilers.
I’m gonna name my future dog meatball I don’t care what breed it will be.. gonna get a Doberman or rotweiler? It will still Be named meatball
Meatball living up to its name
He’s going to be an awesome buddy. What a lovely puppers!!!
Meatball 😂
Awww haha! So cute! 😁😊😁😊
Bronson made you famous
Bronson PERFECT name for a rotweiler!
I would die for Bronson.
why do I always want to kill myself when she says "colone"
I'm a certified Bronson needer
That pug earned his name very well
Meatball tickled my funny bone 🤣.
Awww, look at his big 'ol paws! So cute! ❤🐕
Anyone else hate seeing pugs? They must suffer their whole lives
MEATBALL
Meatball lmao
Cute creature
And now it’s time to play with meatball and get dirty all over again.
a pug named meatball???? why did that make me cry
There ARE NO bad dogs, NO bad breeds, ONLY bad owners and bad breeders. Period.
Cute
🤖📢
0:26 she looks a lot like Pam from The Office. Even the voice is alike.
Will it be fine for my dog, to visit grooming salon first time in her life, if she is 10 and never had been to grooming before?
Meatball is the best name for pug
I love this breed bc they have marks above their eyes that look like eye brows basically making them look even cuter when they are looking around
“And now it’s time to play with Meatball” the most important step in the grooming process.
Seriously I could watch your channel forever
After the initial scare he’s like “oh wait I love getting all this attention”
Omg too cute
Did you train meatball to play with "customers"?
The puppy was such a good boy!
i'm freaking scared of rottweilers, adult ones are so intimidating (thankfully, none haven't bited me)
I WAS NOT READY FOR MEATBALL!!!
I didnt knew americans pronounce rottweiler (hotvailer) like that (rot-uailer), sounds so weird D:
Bronson is a beautiful puppy. So obedient and gentle.
Afraid to catch covid from a dog, take the mask off clown
Imagine meeting a freshly groomed puppy that smells like blueberries. #LifeCompleted
I love him!  Also, my brother has a pug that he named meatball!
And to make it less scary I wiped his face with a rag. Sorry a fancy rag.  Literally not how reducing stress works
How in the world could anyone give this a thumbs down?  I just don’t understand people...
How do I get your job?
Never use cologne on dogs please
Beautiful baby 🥰
We have a 3 month old Rottweiler named Boomer Bronson. They could be twins!
I don’t think I’ve ever seen a rottie with a full tail before.
my Rottweiler mix was also such an handsome girl if she was clean. To bad this never was that long. If there was mud or a shit smelling pond she dive bombed right into it.
Isn't it always time to play with meatball?
don't even talk to me if you don't think rottweiler puppies are the cutest little shits.
cute puppers overload! cant take it! systems shutting down
When their little they are super sweet
Omg Meatball, help me it's too cute!! 😂😂
both pups are so precious!!🥺💕
He has his tail!!!:) that's how it should be
And now it's time to get dirty again.
Meatless ball
How can 680 people dislike this? That dog is beyond cute i don’t even know what to say 😍😍
This not a pure rott. You can tell by the head and jaw structure. The pure German lines are what rotts should look like.
Pure
Rottweilers are so cute with the little brown spots on their face. It looks like they have little eye brows lol
I follow you on tiktok! He is adorable
0:25 i wouldn't go THAT far
Too young
MEATBALL
I love Bronson!
Dog haters: "Rottweilers are dangerous!"  The Rottweilers:
What a cutie 😍
Bronson is cute af
Awww he a tail not a nub xd Hes so cute
Good boy Bronson
Its pretty pathetic to see some weird comments sometimes on that kind of channel. Some people are in extrem pain and sadness. I wish they can read their comments in few years so they can see how shameful it can be for themself.
Omg who cares about you... that Bork Bork is soooo cute 😊
baby rottis are the cutest, most clumsy puppy you'll ever have.
Why would you spray a dog with cologne???
Meatball lol cute little name
I've watched 12 of these, and they are absolutely lovely. What a sweet man!!!
😎
Oh my god look at that cute little rotty!!!😍😍😍
Yaaay meatball. I watched the video with him and now he lost his meatballs.
Then came Bronson.
Why would someone dislike this? Like seriously,  talk to me, tell me what is da problama?
could someone please explain why do they use cologne on dogs? i don't know much about dogs but as they rely heavily on their sense of smell i imagine it would be unsettling to not feel your own scent. i am genuinely very curious, any reply would be appreciated!
Sorry but her voice is giving be big “Number 15, Burger King foot lettuce”, vibes.
Soooooooo u took him a bath n clipped his nails…. How much is that gon cost ?
Not to be dramatic but I would die for Bronson
I want you to read my "go to sleep" meditation
Crazy how rich white people just get these “appointments” just for them to bathe the dog.
What a delightful job you have
i would die for brunson
Good boy!
Tô sentindo o cheirinho desse carinha fofo
Aw such a beautiful dog 😍
PUPPY COLOGNE ?!?!?!? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
H A N D S O M E   B O Y
Dog is cute as shit
her voice goes 📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉
BRONSON
0:21 it's 'pawsitive' not positive, please get your goodboi spellings right.
Great first experience.  He did a great job.  He will likely enjoy future grooms as long as you break out the treats!
I love that the pugs name is meatball
He is so cute. I also love the little “eyebrows” he has.
Meatball is a savage
pupy :3
We need updates on him. He should have his own playlist.
That puppy has some massive paws
So adorable.
Meatless ball now ;(
It’s da baby :3
Omg why are puppies so adorable
This is exceptional to share my name
I love Rottweilers
Pawsitive reinforcement
His fur is so shiny and pretty 😫❤️
Like holy hell, the differences are night and day
Where are you located?
Do americans not like bathing their own dogs?
"And now it's time to play with Meatball."
Note to self: this Meatball is not for eating.... Σ( ° △ °|||)︴
What a good boy!!!!
What a sweet baby angel
why is this the first time I'm seeing a rotwyler puppy
I WANT TO OWN MEATBALL MEATBALL I ✨ADORE✨ EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU

Is meatball your dog?
What a cuty...
He’s sooooooo cute
U mean u used pawsitive re-enforcement as treats 😂😂
what a cutie
rotties are such good babies..he did amazing!!
Why would someone groom a rottweiler? They're not dirty. Their coats don't need brushing. They certainly don't need professional bathing. As cubs?? Maybe their claws may need trimming, but not if they play outside a lot and anyone can do that with a basic doggie nail clipper.
I want meatball 🥰🥰
bronson's little face dots omg 0:51
Love the ear sleep to protect his little ears
Bronson says "I smell like a big blueberry"
His eyes ❤❤❤
Bronson, first name Charles.  What a legend of a puppy.
Feels good to be on the right side of the internet ❤
Bronson’s a beauty
Cuteness overload. 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
The dot eye brows on rotties are tots adorbs.
✌🏼
He’s adorable!!!!!!!!!

Keep his ears and tail intact ! Please don't cut them
Pawsitive reinforcement

He's so stinkin cute!!!!  Where can I get the headband they wear when they're getting dried?
God shes so good with dogs.. also what a good business to have meeting all kinds of dogs.. thats gotta be exciting...  dogs > people
I love the towel on their heads during the blowdrying... All dogs look like little Babushka women xD
Awww he’s so cute
aw he gave her kisses 😚😚
Wonder why he has a tail? I wish my Dobe had his still He has his ears
BRONSON.... ...AND MEATBALL?!!?!  2 FOR 1!
Such a good boy!
Ok i Didnt know i was a Rottweiler
I hope meatball is not a crime boss
Really wish I had thought of giving my dog treats when trimming her nails. Unfortunately that ship has sailed
He’s a clean fluffy puppy
And now Bronson is gonna run around in the grass and roll around mud to celebrate his clean, scrubbed, blueberry-fresh coat. And he's gonna have himself a ball.
Theyre so cute
Meatball? lol that's a good one. I  have a dog name T-bone.
Handsome baby :D
Imagine being a dog and ur name is Meatball 😂😂
Next appointment will be not nice
0:21 babushka hahaha

rottis are so cute as puppies
I love meatball
He reminds me so much of my dog when he was a pup, now he's a big baby Labrador/Beauceron mix
his name is definitely meatball. like i look at that dog and his name is meatball
After the blow dry he looked so floofy
A DOG NAMED MEATBALL IS THE BEST THING IVE HEARD ALL DAY
“The pug named meatball.. a television series”🥲
He really said 👅
Omg this is so sweet
I love rotties and he is adorable ! I'm in love ❤️
Ngl i couldn't stop laughing when you casually said "now it's time to play with *meatball* ".
Can you please do a standard poodle
OMG MEATBALL
The good side of tiktok
I have a BIG dog and he doesn't like baths😭 but I still try😑

My heart flew away in tiny little hearts. 💕
In my next life I wish to be born as a dog in western countries.

Doggo

She should end all videos with “and now it’s time to play with meatball”
Meatball😂😂😂
Aww that is just adorable
Meatball :D
I'm happy to see that Bronson still has his tail, too. Such a handsome boy!
Lol, meatball
And now it's time to play with meatball.
He has happy eyebrows 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Goodest Pooper
I want 12
I love Rottweilers so much
Aaaaw💚
The pugs name is MEATBALL🥺
I don't get why you need to groom a dog like this. I mean, why? I have a labrador and the only time I bathe him is when he jumped into smelly waters or something like that. Why do you need the clip the toe nails of dogs, I thought they wouldn't have to when the dog to walk around outside.
Wish that happened with my dog. She was biting my siblings and I and trying to eat the dryer.
where are you guys located??? i have a "puppy" and would love to take him over for a grooming
This reminds me of my aunt's old rottweiler. He would give you his paw when you asked him and was incredibly well trained but one day he sprinted out of their gate when they were backing up the car and was hit by a speeding car. He survived but had serious brain damage which caused him to be violent. They live somewhere where it's hard to come across a proper vet and if he would need any treatment it would be to expensive for them so they decided to not let him suffer anymore and put him down. It been years since then and I still miss seeing him in his big open backyard where his dog house stands, empty.
I don’t know how your channel popped up on my feed, but I love it.
Holy-...  *he looks VERY soft*
I want to work in a saloon that lets you do whats best for the pup i bought happy hoddies in 3 sizes got told cant use them company policy i love that you use treats to posetive reinforce
Tho i hate TikTok. But TikTok on YouTube like one of these give me life.
Now i want meetball
Hopefully the dog's owners train it well, those dogs can be dangerous if not trained or taken care of properly. My neighbors would keep theirs in a kennel all the time, they learned quickly that that wasn't the right thing to do when their kid accidentally let three of the dogs out and they came and killed two of our goats. They lost one dog and apparently the other two were injured. Pretty sure they were breeding them, the woman could only talk about the money and even called the police on us and filed a false report. That happened last Sunday and I still can't believe it happened. 🙄
Cologne doesn’t smell like blueberries. Just because you put perfume on a guy doesn’t make it cologne. Lol.
these vids are sooo cute - however, wondering why a dog would need a blueberry cologne when they have such a sensitive sense of smell and I find most deodorants intense as a human
wow my dog looks like that and my tenant below looks like that put what are the chances lol
*And now it's time to play with meatball.* 🥺🖤
why did ppl dislike this
The puppy is cute and all but girl got a nice soothing voice
This will also be the last time this dog is cute and sweet.
Awwww, he baby
Meatball!?!?!??!!😅😅🥲🤣🤣😂😂🥲🤣🤣🥲
I got cologne on ladies, watch out
PROTECT BRONSON AT ALL COSTS
Just when the video couldn't get any better a pug named... meatball.
i swear rottie are the sweetest dogs
Meatball chunky
He’s such a sweetie
awwwwwwwwwwwwww!!  what a cute little baby!
TG he still has his tail.
Meatball is a fitting name
That's an extremely well behaved Rott puppy. He must go to training
This makes me hate rotties a little less.  Just a little.
0:04 discord mods
Does the dog really need cologne? Seems a bit overkill
what a cutie!
He's adorable!   Hope he's raised as a loving pet dog , would not want to see that precious puppy innocence disappear!
What a cute lil tike 🥴🥰
I would die for Bronson
When it said it was over the pup was like its over already.... please dont stop
man the amount of product placement
I’d like to know more about this meatball kid
Bronson
The blow-dryer reminds me so much of the first time I tried to use buzz clippers on my cat.  Five solid minutes of trying to get them near her while she was screaming and writhing like they were the accursed soul-flayers of Sh'el Gorath.  The very second they finally touched her she froze and fixed me with this baffled, disbelieving look. It's like, _yes, the most these things will do is slightly tickle you. Now knock it off._
Meatball is stand ups for his name  No offense I love dogs too
Awe that is the most cutest thing 😍 💗 I want a dog so bad
He is huge and amazing
i remember when my sister's rottweiler was this cute🥺
Rotties are always super adorable
why cant the owners do that and donate the money they saved.
“And now, it’s time to play with Meatball”   Me: But of course it is
Meatball.
Let's be honest, Meatball was the star here.
I have a German Shepherd Belgian Shepherd mix named Brawnson
Is meatball also a treat?  - Bronson
this is one good boi
Bronson is sooooo adorable
wow meatball is really... meatball. Cute
Treats are a gift and curse In the doggie world
Is the cologne necessary though?
That rottie has tail!!! Wooo, happy boy! (Me not the puppy, well Brawnson too since it's wagging)
Ooohhh he did such a good job!  I’m so proud of him!
Meatball 😂
Rotties are just the best.
If I cant get that blueberry cologne, then I dont want cologne
Number 15, Burger king foot lettuce.
why the F a dog needs cologne?
OMG that’s the perfect name for that fat pug!
Does she have to get consent from the owners to film their pets?
HE SO CUTE
Turn your phone sideways
Why would people ever dislike this video
So fluffy
Blueberry cologne! The ladies must coming running after that.
Don't get a rottweiler or any very active breed unless you know 100% you can handle it. Far too many end up in shelters because their people were too busy or too sedentary.
HIS FLOPPY EEEEEEEAAAAAAARRRRRRRSSSSSSSS!!!
Are we gonna ignore the fact, that the pug's name is Meatball?
What a cutie oh my gosh
AWWWW SO CUTEEE
Vicious
She speaks just like modest pelican, but with a girl voice.
"Now it's time to play with Meatball."  OMFG, best name for a pug, ever.
That’s one beautiful Rottweiler 😍
Why would groomers spray any "cologne" or "perfume" on a pet? That's just stupid for many reasons, not the least of which being the very real chance of a serious allergic reaction when they groom themselves. There's no way it's worth the risk for your pet to smell like whatever for a few hours... and if they smell like that for longer than a few hours, it is oil based which compounds the potential problem for many dogs (and all cats).
Ahaha, he definitely looks like he’s having a good time. Gotta love that blep near the end, too (how his tongue kinda sticks out a bit)
Why do I want to have all dogs in the world
I can't even convey how much I love seeing a rottie with a tail
Never seen a rottie with a tail before, they look much better with them.
First time seeing a Rottweiler since mine passed away...
"And now it's time to play with meatball" and a pug walks in haha I love that
Look at him with no ears 😭
number 15
pls tell bronson i love him
He won’t enjoy his second wash! He’ll remember!
My cousins blue staffs name is Bronson
“This is Bronson” has the same energy of “Burgerking foot lettuce”
AWWWWW
Hes adorable
Will become a spoiled kid
HES such a nice Boy <3
How do you get into this profession?
1.3M views in a fortnight, for talking about your job for less than a minute.  This video is a money printing press...
I'm still trying to figure out something cool to comment...
I watch your vids everyday and I love seeing your channel grow! Road to 100k 🤍🤍🤍
The way she started talking had some real "burger king foot lettuce" vibes lol
you have such a soothing and melodic voice! Bronson and Meatball are such fitting names for these two honestly, what an uplifting video ^^
Hello everyone            This is YOUR Daily dose of Grooming Dogs
SOo Flufffy
Give him dem treats
thi is the cut without biting the kid in the face multible times
Glad I'm not the only one who blow drys their dog
this gave me some good memories when my rott was tiny ;-;  shes a big girl now haha. they grow up so fast ✋🏽😭
VERY dangerous dog
What a cutie 😍
He's so precious omg and the other dog is named Meatball 😭💕
You know what Kero the Wolf does when he watch those videos
Wow. Americans deodorant their dogs.
the little blep at the end 😭
That's not a puppy, that's a blueberry with a blep.
PUG NAMED MEATBALL PUG NAMED MEATBALL
That’s a big puppy
they look more cute when they have a long tail
Jesus loves you so much ❤️ I was addicted to porn, I was on drugs, alcohol, I hated people, he set me free and he can set you free aswell ❤️ all you have to do is repent and trust in him and he will change your life!! ❤️
So nice to see a Rott without its tail cropped off
Rott are the sweetest dogs ever. It's sad that so many people are scared of them. Don't get me wrong, they have super-strength and often don't realize it. But I've never met one that wasn't an absolute sweetheart.   Dalmations, on the other hand, are absolute dicks.
Can't stink if you wanna hang round with Meatball.
THE PUGS NAME IS MEATBALL
This shit is wholesome AF!
Idk why but I’m hooked at watching your videos and I keep noticing that the puppy’s are a bit bigger than you
Daily Dose Of Internet Dogs
thats what you call a "feini"
Another channel that won't stop popping up in my recommendations 🥱
Hope this dude gets to come in to you as the years go by so he has a familiar face help him out :)
Can anyone please tell me what In the world is blueberry and jelly bean cologne? I know what blueberries smell like and taste like, but what about jelly bean? What flavor? I have to know.
can he get the waves doe
Awww
What a wigglebutt!
Please use DOG HARNESS, instead of throat collar
Too cute ;_;
i love the little eye browsssss😤🤲
Meatball is such a fitting name for a pug
What a sweetie😍
the only type of dog that cuter as they get older
I like to binge watch your videos because they’re short detailed and sweet!!🥰
I would loved to be him to play with Meatball ;)
dogs like "blueberry cologne" ?   learn something every day
What a cutiepie! And omg the pugs name is perfect hah
Your channel gives me life.
Do you stricly groom dogs or have you ever groomed a cat before?
Is it okay to put perfume on a dog? I thought it might bother them since they have such a hightened sense of smell
So clean and floofy!
why does  a dog need cologne? unnecessary, leave humans to poison themselves with cologne and don't put that shit on dogs ffs
Stop spraying dogs with cologne, they're not supposed to smell like a rose that can really mess things up with other dogs
I can't find another more suitable name for a pug named Meatball
hmmm Meatball
I love bronson.
That thing will grow up to be a killing machine.
I’ve known meatball for 3 seconds and if anything happened to him I’d kill everyone on earth and then myself.
Such a good pup!
HIS NAME IS MEATBALL
Oh that little boy is so handsome!!!
The only type of grooming i approve
What a good boy
0:19  He is now a seal
This is one of the cutest channels on YouTube. Thank you for these
Everybody wants a rottweiler or pittbull cuz they think they cute but imo the lockjaw that they have is too dangerous and there r many irresponsible owners
I miss my Rott... She was the lovliest biggest softie! She passed away because our family friend didnt take care of her properly and contracted a disease when we were out in the country. I miss her so much
The cologne is as unnecessary as it is inappropriate for dogs.
Why do u have to be so monotone. Sounds so bad.
El Perro
Awesome work
Beautiful dog.
I would like this puppy to stay this size forever
He reminds me too much of the Rottweiler I used to have, her name was Anya.
But why?  1 put dog in tub. 2. get dog wet. 3. schampoo the dog. 4. dry the dog. Repeat when dirty^^
He’s a handsome boy
Dog cologne
Cute Babooshka
CUTEEEEE DOGSSSSSSS ❤️❤️❤️❤️
What da dog doin
He has amazing eyebrows 💞
He’s a big BOI
I love how she talks!
🥺pupper
A pug named meatball? Sold!
Look at those beans !
Fuzzy rottie fuzzie rottie fuzzie rottie!!
To anyone reading this God loves you soo much that he even sent his only son to die for us so live for him.🤍✝️
How much does that cost?
Meanwhile the groomers at petco cut off all the ears on the dog
This is the only kind of job I would do for free  Edit: Omg blueberry cologne 🥰
I would lay down my life for meatball
Stop spraying dogs with cologne! Some of them are even gonna try to hide that smell by rolling in shit the next time they are outside
Best Rottweiler name.
I have a rottweiler
Love to see a rotty that hasn't had their ears completely destroyed by bastard owners that want to make them look "scarier"
He handled it better then my Hank. Hank took a dump on the table and the people in the attached pet produce shop could hear him whine.
Good boy Bronson!
Big day for a big pup
What do you think smells better? Blueberry cologne or jelly bean cologne?
Aww he looks so soft n fuzzy
"Meatball"😭
Such a good puppy.
To be real.. If you have a dog and you dont know how to bath or groom its nails.. DONT HAVE A FUCKING DOG THEN. Its the basics. Dont pay other people for your Ignorance.
Meatball is the perfect name for a pug
M e a t b a l l
Calling a dog meatball is just one step away from people calling the dog "dog meat" in fallout 4
The Pug is called Meatball, dare I say that's some smart naming
I thought this video couldn't get better, then "now it's time to play with Meatball" happened.
I have a Rottweiler German shepherd pup 7 months. Both parents pure. His coat is like a rottie, feet like a rottie, head a mix of both and body like a German shepherd
Finally some good fucking news.
Play with “meatball” ??? Seriously? 🤣
I wanna see more Meatball :)
Other dogs: cute cotton candy shampoo  This boy: the DIRTY DOG shampoo
"This is Bronson." "Number Fifteen."
The best name for a Rottweiler, Bronson The best name for a pug, meatball
STOP putting perfum on dogs! Do you use dog smell on yourself?
I'd die for Bronson
Everything about this video..... just..... YES
You mean Pawsitive reinforcement right?
why does this person vaguely sound like that chills guy
"He did great for his first appointment." I refuse to believe this doggo has ever done anything not-great!
meatball :)
Let’s eat meat ball
How often should one take their dog to a groomer? especially when they can't do the necessary themselves such as giving baths etc.
Pug named meatball xd
It'll all about getting to play with Meatball at the end.  He's the prize.
What a precious
Meatball is a legend
Meatball is the perfect name for a fat boy 😩😍
Bronson. Good name.
Cologne worse thing you can do to a dog. Just because it's pleasant for humans doesn't mean it is for dogs. Smfh
Aww such a wittle smoosh 💕💕💕
MEATBALL 😍
DID HE GET MORE TREATS?!
Meatball looks the part
He's gonna grow up to make a great baby mauler 🥺🥺💞💞💞
Looks tasty but the blueberry cologne wouldn’t go well with the meat
Meatball is a great name.
I need a whole series named "The adventures of Bronson and Meatball"
So cute and such a good dog.

❤️❤️❤️
meat ball
Handsome looking boys
Awww good bronson
Very cute..  But who thought "You know what this dog needs? To smell like *blueberries!"*
At the end.  "More treats?!"
its hard to find ur channel by searching for your name considering its just 'girl with the dogs'
i want to see more meatball videos please
I would die for Bronson
I would die for Bronson
Lol the lil turtleneck on his head when blow drying him aww
I don’t think Blueberries and Meatballs are a good combo but the vid say otherwise
Meatball sure looks meaty😂
"Now its time to eat meatball"
And it truly is...a meatball.
Your voice would have more of a cadence if you didn't read off a script.
He's a happy tater tot.
It’s so cool that you have cologne for dogs, that is such a great idea!
I love it when dogs aren't croped or docked despite what the others will say about preserving breeds. Dogs look better without any croping or docking. Same with cats de-clawing.... like no.
I dont know why this was on my feed but omggg im glad it was, that puppy is so damn cute tho
Handsome lil boy
Bronson. What a great name. Now I want dogs named after 60s movie stars. Redford. McQueen. Garner. Donahue. Peck.
You are not a good person
10/10 voiceover.
They don't like synthetic odours.
I hope meatball doest become meatball when Bronson grows up.
I would die for him
We love you, Bronson ❤
There’s 397 people i hope don’t get the vaccine
welp that was fantastic
bas les couilles ..........................
SUCH A GOOD BOY 😭😭💕
She talks like a genderbend version of your daily dose of internet guy
I wish her voice was happier😂😂😂
15/10! wat a good boi!
I miss my Rottweiler Edit: they did meatball dirty😂😭
I hope they do not go chop off his tail.
Did the dog grow throughout this video💀💀
It's so cute ;-; I wish I had a puppy
Just wierd.. Do people let other people wash their own children to.. Your animal is your child.. Why dont you take care of it by yourself??
I’ll take all your dogs please
Why does she talk like the burguer king foot lettuce guy?
He’s so fluffeh 🥰
I love her voice so much 😍😍😍😍
Made my day
He just so cute.
Rottweilers are so cute! I want one in the future
Bronson can have my heart
Why do they spray a dog down with cologne... what
What do you do for a living? I wash dogs
ngl meatball is pure C H O N K
Rottie are the best breeds very affectionate but that pug was a real meatball hhh
You've got an awesome job!
If you need to clip a dogs nails then they are living in the wrong environment.
I love bronson.
AWWW he is adorable! I wanna give him a nice boop and a treat for the road.
that purple head wrap 😂 i imagine him in a spa.
Yeah he's cute for sure, but I want to see MEATBALL's episode too.
Nice, a dog uses cologne and I don't...such a cutie.
That last sentence was a real pleaser for some reason.
Hey we’re do I have to go to get my dog a bath at your place
Give it 9 months playing with meatball will turn into “now it’s time for him to have a meatball sub” lol
he's illegally cute.
For dogs with under coats do you have to use the shed shampoo? My brother has a great perenese puppy and doesn’t really have the money to take her to the groomers. Any tips?
Love the "paw" tattoo! 🐾
that looks like my german shepard labrador mix!! :))
Bronson & Meatball ™
I like how he looks soo confused yet is happy
BABEY
Rottweilers are big and how she said "meatball" the Rottweiler could eat "meatball".
Blueberry cologne! When a dog's sense of smell is as powerful as it is... 🤔
He's such a good boy! <3
fuck meatball
What a precious little baby 😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
i’m not a fan of rottweilers bc one chased my brother down our street and he had to jump THROUGHa fence and then had to pick it up and hold it to the fence to keep the dog away from him
She sounds like Goobertown Hobbies
He looks so SOFT
"And that's it Bronson is all finished"😂
My rotten hound is 7 years old and it takes us 4 cheese slices to get her nails cut. !
M E A T B A L L ALL HAIL THE PUG
omg i wanna smell that parfum spray she used
My family has never had to clip any of our dogs' nails. If you walk a dog the proper amount, they will never need to get their nails clipped in their life.
I didnt know theres cologne for pets
DOGS! DON`T! NEED! COLOGNE!
If not raised by idiot owners who make them aggressive rotts are the perfect dogs. Loyal sweet good family dogs and also super protective when NEED be. Don’t have to force that it’s in their blood that’s where people ruin them by trying to train them to be protective.
Tell the dog not to play with his food
0:47 question why the blue berry colone? Isent it a bit to mutch foor a dogs nose or do thy like the smell?
Hes beautiful!
She sounds like a female version of chills
I demand more MEEBALL
THE PUG'S NAME IS MEATBALL
Problem: ✨ Exists ✨ Solution: 🥓 Bribery 🥓
Do you recommend bringing your puppy to the groomers early on just to get them used to being there? Even if they don't get cut?.
Hes so cute and fluffy!
rotties have the cutest puppy faces I swear
Meatball is a literal ball of meat 💀
What a handsome boy!
He looks just like my puppy but mines smaller
He's gorgeous!
Meatball is the cutest dog I've ever seen
He was like "ooooh piece of candy"
I would die for Bronson
He’s a king
CUTE!!!
Hahahaha meatball!!!!🤣🤣🤣
Rottweiler's are not aggressive dogs. I hate people who buy them thinking it will be some kind of killer guard dog then treat them badly when they do not perform to the stereotype.
Aww that's a good boy Bronson
Cute 🙂
imagine getting paid to do this. These guys are living the life.
I want a Rottweiler so bad but it’s so hard to find one 🥲
ROTTIES!!!!!
Bronson is calm and obedient. Good boy.
his Lil eyebrows
Puppy always cute
I would love to have another baby like him rotties really are big babies ❤️
The little cutie reminds me of my rottie. He looked VERY similar to this doggo when he was a little puppy, had him for a good 17 years. RIP Bear. Hope he's playing with all the tennis balls he wants over the rainbow bridge
My town has bad experiences with Rotties but every time I see one, I fall a little bit more in love.
I have no idea where you are located but I definitely want you to groom my pup♡
Awwwwwww

My friend has 2 Rottweilers
So cute
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOCUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUTTTE GOING TOOOOOOO EXPLOOOOOODE
I can't believe how much money is being made off of animals dogs cats grooming they got their own stores now they have insurance I used to wash my dog's all the time and take care of them I think these people are lazy and spoiled and if their dog is chipped then it's the devil itself pet shelters I'm making millions scraping the money off of the top given $15,000 operations to a stray cat that should have been put to sleep it was in such bad shape but that doctor got paid and then they chipped it bragging how they chipped it you can have your chipped animals do flip a switch and I'll probably just all go crazy they're starting to go now children and pets God I'm sick of it and so is God nothing personal lady we all got to make a living off of the lazy rich
Awwwwwwww
He is gorgeous and u did an awesome job!! He looked so clean and fluffy! Meatball is adorable. Great job! I admired the fact you try to not traumatize him. You are gentle. Pet parents really appreciate that!
Aww i remember when my baby was that little... now hes 100 pounds at a year old
My heart ❤️ ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
U are so lucky u get to groom cute ass dogs for a living
Rottweilers are so cute
If Bronson goes missing it really wasn’t me
Pit bull pls do a pit bull
I think we need more meatball now
Do a Pitbull
I'm kind of surprised, is it normal to use cologne to spray on a dog ? It seems unnatural, and even if it's natural products in, a dog needs to have a ''natural smell'' because that is their ID, isn't it ? Is a shower enough ? Dogs noses are very sensitive... 😰 But maybe I'm wrong and I'm sorry...
Omged❤❤❤😨i what him i was trying to find a 🐕
Bro
Meatball and branson are so cute
I don't care if your dog is a female, it always a gud boi
But he looked clean already? Also typically a mother dog will groom the puppy’s, so good job fucking up that, I don’t understand this obsession that some dog owners have where they feel they need to control everything in their life including how a living breathing creature looks, if u take ur dog to be “groomed” regularly then ur just a control freak
Meat ball has a new freind
I would die for Meatball
Awww sooo cute!!!!!!
Your voice is soo soothing  to hear
I am getting a Rottweiler when I grow up
I've got a rottweiler and most people say they're mean dogs but Bronson is a sweet one.
Meatball perfect name for a pug 😍
How many cologne do u have
My dog is hypoallergenic and it's sooo handy not having dog hair everywhere 😌😌

Goddess, he’s so fucking cute 🤩
Meatball? Really?
Omg 🥰
Meatball
Meatball....is the most unusual name for a dog I've ever heard

I have two dogs that were traumatized by water in a puppy mill so we can't wash them :(
He good boy
Ooh. He had a TAIL! Adorbs 🥰
SO CUTE
Okay me next
I wish all people would be taught to constantly play with their puppies kittens hands and feet constantly. Even if they're older you can start out slow but constantly play with their feet so when they're touched their not so suspicious that what you're doing. I have never had an issue with toenail cutting on anything because of this period even on reptiles that I rescued. You start out slowly touching their feet and pretty soon it's just a constant thing while they're being touched my animals have no issues because of it. It should be taught as a part of pet life just like anything else.
I have a Rottweiler Labrador mix,and she’s the cutest and sweetest dog ever,
Awwww
Very cute dog, but why spray it with cologne? I wouldn‘t want my dog to smell like cologne...
Omg he is the cutest effing baby EVERRRRR 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Not to be overly dramatic but I would die for Bronson
Meatball 😂
He’s so fricken good!

Why's he chained?

Good boy, Bronson! Love those German bred dogs!
Who else thinks meatball is the perfect name for a pitbull
Chomke
If you’d called me, I would think you were an answer machine.
Keep strong. Dont forget that despite the evil in this world, God is full of justice, mercy and love.   Justice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world's previous perfection to be destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don't think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God's perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says "the soul that sins shall die". BUT, mercy said "I dont want to give them what they deserve. I don't want them to be cut off from Me. I love them despite all they have done/will do against Me. I want to give My children another chance. I want them to come home and live in My love again".   And love said "Jesus, God's Son, came down as a Man, our representative, suffering every temptation, pain and struggle we have ever faced, yet without sin. He took all our sins (past/present/ even future) to the cross and then crucified EVERY ONE on our behalf. Justice was paid on the cross so that we can be free from Hell's punishment, experience Gods mercy of forgiveness of sin and live in His love. If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (turn away from our sin and pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life.  He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it.  He doesn't want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through Him (not ourselves as it's impossible without depending on His power and instruction). So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to obey His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and ask Him to help us in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, or struggling or doubtful, simply be honest and tell Him that. He is not intimidated by ANY sin or struggle you are facing. ANY. He hears and will answer. If we pray for Him to come in, regardless of the condition, then He will.  NOTE: You are NEVER too sinful or messed up that God cannot turn your life around through Jesus. EVER. If you have any questions let me know!
That's a big puppy
I wanna hug that dog
Cologne...for a dog....
Look at him he’s so cute

I broke down laughing when I heard/saw Meatball 🤣   Best dog name ever. It fits too well

Beautiful dog
He is so cute
Awwwwwww he a angle❤
awwwwwww good job
Puppy with doesn't exist, it can't hurt you: *Puppy with eyebrows*
Wow what an outstanding job from these groomers. I hope the owner keeps taking them back to the same place for the rest of his life, but either way he's never going to be nervous at the groomers with this type of care and expertise right out of the gate.
Sooooooooooooooo beautiful dog sooo
Man meatball be like  "Ah shit, here we go again"
He so cute
He is beautiful
Wow. I am not a fan of rottweilers at all but Bronson is the cutest one ever. Too bad he's gonna get big and mean looking...

I love how Rott puppies always have their little tongues sticking out. He is so cute 😍
As he so cutereeee
This is Bronson, a 4 month old good boy
my friends dog got groomed the other day and  came back smelling like cinnamon. a fresh groomed, pleasant smelling dog is the best.
First of all,he's adorable. Secondly,I love that his tail isn't docked.
HE SO SOFT I'M GOING TO DIE
He’s so cute I love him omg
Do your clients have the choice of what scent you use at the end? Or is the blueberry just the “go to” fragrance? I bet it smells amazing! I’ve just always wanted to know if it’s chosen by the client or not. ☺️
A pug named meatball 😭😭❤❤❤❤
Bronson and meatball IS SOO FRICKING CUTEEEEE
Fuck yeah
Blueberry cologne?!?! 🥺🥺🥺 awww so cuteee
Everyone: omg such a cute rott! Me: Meatball is probably the best name for a pug ever.
Do you get dobermans often?
😇
I wish I had a doggo
And now it is time to play with Meatball! Awh
Ok this time she did a lot better than the last one I saw.  On the last one she almost got bitten because the  dog didn’t like the dryer and getting his nails clipped. If it were me doing this I would have not clipped or dryer the first time until the pup was more used to it.
Sheesh
Bronson is such a pretty boi🥺🥺❤❤
AWW that rott I'd so adorable 🥺
Arf, arf...
Meatball!!!!!!!!!
You do everything just right, I've seen so many groomers, and they're reaction would be "oh just a puppy only half the time".....when in actual fact they should be doubling the time for 1st appointments also having extra patience and doing the positive re-enforcement, as you've shown, and in addition your grooms are beautifully done,...If I  still had my pooch I'd take her to you all day long...👏🐶💗
“and now its time to play with meatball”
My dog is name is Bronson he is a Boxer
Does anyone else just want some of this blueberry cologne they keep talking about?
Ik this was probably implied but I wanna say it anyways ^^  When dogs get there first few groomings they are alwase chained bc obviously they with try to run so the puppy is ok 😊
This is to show people rotwilers are really friendly and people stereotype them to be mean and aggressive
4 months old and hes bigger than my 10 year old dog damn
I super enjoy your videos! :) It's also very educational as we have two dogs in our house. We'll definitely try to do the things you do at home as well 💜
I love dogs

M E A T B A L L
“And now it’s time to play with Meatball” I love everything about this sentence.
Who do this, like seriously is that legal to do this to a dog ?
Dirty Dog 🐶 Shampoo 🧴 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
I want meatball. Just saying
Let me guess, you're bathing him in your dirty dog shampoo
Thats funny, I used to bath my Rottweiler with a gas powered pressure washer and "groom" her with a vacuum cleaner power head with a beater bar. She loved it, ever watch 130lbs of dog try to stuff itself under the vacuum every time you try to clean?  The pressure washer is great if yours will let you use it on them. Use the widest arc nozzle.  It blasts all that fine undercoat off of them come shedding season. You end up with a good size pile of excess dog in short order.  Wet, wash, rinse, condition and power wash to rinse the conditioner out... great big lumps of under fur come out.
2 seconds later Bronson was rolling in the mud puddle in the parking lot.
"And now its time to play with meatball" best line of the video
Can you do a Belgium malinois

Can you please Do a Great Dane
Wht us dirty dogs sope
Please- why are you using a chain- that brings aggression in dogs because it is painful when they pull on the leash. I have no idea why your using it but it’s not a very good idea. I’m not here to judge but that is very painful for the dog and for a 4 month puppy it can really cause aggression.I also noticed this on other videos and it is painful for the dog so I’m not sure why you using it…
Can we talk about how adorable meatball is too😍
