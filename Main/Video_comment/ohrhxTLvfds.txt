I miss fuck world 😢😢
Bro doesn’t know about Beatter than wolves
What was that in the background? 12:41
26:47 coom
The saddest thing is, if jschlatt just respawned as soon as he died in the lava, fuckworld and the other one would’ve teleported back to him instead of falling into the lava
2:50 CHICKEN JOCKEY
I can tell who’s the favorite dog 😂
tbh , if J schlatt respawn quickly , the wolf wont got burned to death probably
03:00 chicken jockey!
9:24 - I've never laughed so hard 😂😂😂 Don' worry it's just the Lux Jengu 🤣🤣🤣  17:55 - Some real bars damn Tom! 😂 19:28 - Ones again 😂
The fact that schlatt clowns on tommy in the beginning for the pressure plate door, and he gets killed by pressure plate traps and loses his dogs. The irony
11:10 m-m-massive?
2:40 chicken jocky :] (I'm sry)
2:51 Well I think we all know we’re this is going from this small clip
6:44 Long live the pope
2:55 chicken jockey chain starts here
2:50 CHICKEN JO-
2:49 CHIKEN JOCKEY
16:59 “fucworld” dies 😢
this is just 30:59 of 3 men getting their dignity’s ruined by a game 💀
24:39 Tommy sounds like a woman here😂
Uk
16:52 the horrors of war
2:54 CHICKEN JOCKEY
Someone help me I'm dying 😂
2:08 that's what we in the business call foreshadowing
O my god, I play this mod and they did so much wrong!
11:11 you know what else is massive
RLCraft
2:04 is foreshadowing 16:26
0:04 whos the sniper
grateful
Who still here
17:08
Charlie: LESSON ONE, WERE NOT SAFE ANYWEAR  Tommy: *starts laughing*
12:41  SkElEtOn
JOJO GOLDEN WIND
4:37 whoa it's coming down XD
If u got no bed you r fked and far away from ur friends
11:12 you know what else is massive?
Tommy: wow that’s massive   You know what else is massive
I really wish they had done a part two of this one
Now play better than wolves
2021 😢good old prime Tommyinnit
You know it’s a good vid when schlatt and charlie is together
I believe better than wolves is still the hardest mod.
Rest In Peace, Fuckworld
wish they made a series or something, i love the dynamic between the 3 and rlcraft as a modpack
What is the intro song?
4:12
“I survived Minecraft’s hardest mod” ahh video
next video: Tommyinnit Beating Rahovart
are you a men liker, women enjoyer, or a secret third option? (or fourth?)
*the tree falling down* Charlie: Whoah it's coming down *runs to the tree and ies*
do it again
4:39  timber lol 🤣🤣
6:36 "rare striking creeper of darkness" What mod is that?
shlatt walk is impervious to the krakes
26:53 felt like i was watching a scooby doo episode
16:45 NOOOOO
Why does Tommy sound like a rubber chicken at 17:16 to 17:17
i got grounded while watching this, awesome
rip fuckworld
7:50 The scream of pure fear lol😂
Ummm that's actually 2 goals 0:10
CHARLIE JUST GOT SNIPED
3 years ago.. I remember seeing this when the first hour it was uploaded!
2:06: "There's a pressure plate" "It's for the door dumbass" "Schlatt, never make that assumption again". 16:30: *Schlatt steps on a pressure plate and falls into lava*
7:30 song name: Shell City Dead Ahead from the Spongebob Movie Ps2 Game
7:30 THE SPONGEBOB PS2 MUSIC!!
Hi
17:15 where do I know that music from?
Pretty sure thats the start and the easiest boss…
i think rlcraft
10:05 im sorry he WHAT
Slimecicle's freestyle rap is crazy 💀
WATCHED.
“His name was fuckworld and now he is dead, I don’t have enough skill to eat this bread”😭😭 those bars
RIP fuckworld
Honestly they spawned in one of the betters spawns you could get in RLCraft.🍀
"His name was fuckworld, now he is dead, I don't have enough skill to eat this bread-"
16:51 both dogs would have lived if he had hit respawn as they would tp to spawn befor jumping in the lava
HOW THE FUCK WAS THIS THREE YEARS AGO!!!!!!
"It's for the door, dumbass" Proceeds to die and lose fuckworld because of a pressure plate
Bro Charlie is skilled enough to use a bow but uh he isn’t skilled enough to eat
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUCK WORLLLLLLLLLLLLLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 17:01
nymphs give you regenaraition when you go near them
3 years later still waiting for a part 2
the best part about your vids is the subtitiles :)
I might be 3 years too late but I love how Charlie warned schlatt about the pressure plates in the start, then schlatt falls victim to the pressure plate trap
if you think this is the hardest mod you are very wrong better than wolves is the real hardest mod
28:30 Poor Schlat 😢😂
what do you use to make your worlds multiplayer
29:54 😀
NOOOOOOOOO FUCKWORLD
“How to train your dragon… gimm- gim-“ truly awe inspiring words
wheres part 2
the death of fuckworld and "the other one" was truly a depressing loss. jschlatt didnt deserve that misery.
I don't like this child.
Well now its present day. GOOD GOB ON 15MIL TOMMY!
bro what`s the mod to this?
10:15 What the fuck i just watches you piss on me😂
I played and did NOT survive. Instructions unclear
do this again, with the same people
I  Subscribed and liked love ur vids
Bro schlatt is an idiot for letting fuckworld die, all he had to do was respawn and the dogs would teleport away
Rip fuckworld 🪦🐶
2024 gang where you at
wait untill he learns abaut better than wolves
Fuck world!🗣🔥
“ITS FUCKIN FURCON OUT THERE” killed me lmao
if jschlatt just respawned his dogs wouldnt have died
Sucks that this is one of the only vids without him.
they hit they're lowest point at 17:02 r.i.p fu**world
Tommy needs to come back to this mod for 15mil!
This video was disappointing, do better
6:20
Part 2?
"i need to UPGRADE my mouth" H o w . . . ?
I like how tommy said he survived rlcraft in the title but he actually died like fifty times😂
men:men don't cry also men:"wolf dies" men: "sobs"
17:46 Tommy salutes hitler
17:17 chicken laugh
this tommyinnit video is now official JJBA content
0:27
this game is like UCN if you could walk
cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeèeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeese
Still waiting for episode 2
7:37 is the best scream heard in the world. and 7:51
If I was there I’d be so fucking traumatised
Here’s a recommendation for getting us to enjoy a video, extremely hilarious torture
Tommy If you think rlcraft is hard try better then wolfs its a little bit older... But its way harder (making crafting table can take +10 days...)
Where is the *PART 2*
Where did you download this mod?
Charlie: can I eat this am I skilled enough to eat this, *CLICK, CLICK*, I need to upgrade my mouth.
I am not smart enough to use the iron axe - Schlatt J  2024
2024 dudes i watching old videos of Tommy     i never laugh like that before Jschlatt panicked when Charlie said about God
I thought the hardest mode was Better Than Wolfs
I play this mod and I die every time cuz I always spawn next to a dragon
😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
nah that pretty easy i just created like 49 to maybe 50 world
what is this swtich up on f world and bars lol
8:48 THEY PREDICTED IT
The mod is very hard in a certain area if you catch my drift ;)
Were is part 2 charlie?
I can't believe fuckworld's dead....
2:08 if only Schlatt didn’t make that assumption later…rip fuckworld.
R.i.p fuckworld
RIP Fuckworld
7:36 15:47
Schlatt underestimates pressure plates at 2:01 and Charlie tells him to not do so. Then, he and his dogs die because of a pressure plate trap in 16:26 The Pressure Plate Arc.
19:58 omg,, it's Bart Watch out, he'll vore you
"I survived..."  Did you tho? XD
RIP Fuckworld and The Other One.  BTW, my heart melted when Jschlatt hugged Jambo after his dogs died.
This is the only video where I've seen Tommy actually doing something helpful
FUCKWORLD
Bro you got a lot of subs make another video of it
Imagine if this modpack was in the dream smp
Now that's getting hardest mod
Poor fuckword and the other one
16:37 I cry 😭
Schlatt just stating to pray-
THE POOR FUCKING WOLFS😨😭😭😭
16:54 schlatt was genuinely sad that they both died
I can’t believe they fought the real final boss of the RLcraft mod: The Pope.
when you look at the death screen at 16:41 when Jschlatt was sad it said  "Do you really want to respawn?... think about it"
What song is that?
Yo this video is nice but now you have 14 million subscribers so congratilations🎉
Do this again. Its the 4th time iv watchd this video and it never gets old
So... When's part 2 😂
The boss music at the end 😂😂😂
You know they could've just scale the tower and get to the boss without dying that much
I can take one of my headphones and still hear him through both of my ears
Tommy: “His name was fuck world, but now he’s dead.” Schlatt: *starts breaking down* Tommy again: “I don’t have enough skill to eat this bread.”
7:04 SCHLLAT DONT YOU DARE SACRIFICE A CAT!!! SACRIFICE YOURSELF BUT NOT CAT! CATS ARE GOOD THEY CANNOT BE SACRIFICED ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE LOOK ADORABLE.
Wither in bedrock editition🔥🔥
Tommy: *thinking it’s going to be a fun time* Charlie: *getting flashbacks* It is not fun. It is stressful!
I heard somewhere that a diamond giant sword is really good for clearing those Towers as well as the ability to hack
what song played at beginning
"We need to destroy the tower"
I can't believe u guys used journey in the back ground top 10 songs man
I have this mod and to me it’s easy and I know for a fact I am younger then Tommy.
SANS?!??! GOLDEN NESS?!!?! SANS UNDERTABLE?!??!! 16:08
17:06 I´ve just noticed that Schlatt is actually crying
The saddest part is that the second dog takes one more tick of damage to die And fuckworld had armor
19:09 this Was no words Schlatt was dealing with so much shit when he was rapping
Dungeon boss isn't near the hardest boss make a second part where you fight the lycanite bosses
6:40 schlatt was spittin bars
0:27  what is this song, it sounds cool, plz tell me anyone
6:51 my favorite part
all my homies love listening to fuckworld
rest in peace fuckworld
the genuine grief in schlatt's face when fuckworld and the other one died
lesson one we are not safe anywhere
7:38 this bit 😭
tommyinnit's next RL craft video title "here we go again"
Schlatt in the beginning: the pressure plate is for the door dumba$$ Schlatt at the end: IT WAS THE FVUCKING PRESSURE PLATES *both dogs die* NOOOOOOOO-
18:15 Schlatt has cat
Schlatt trying to sacrifice jambo is keeping my sanity intact
R.I.P Fuckworld… 😔
The sad thing is, is that this isn't the hardest modpack to ever exist. As we now have access to, for the second time ever, the modpack Better Than Wolves has been rereleased to the public. Now it's only a matter of time.
9:30 💀💀
one of the most underated tommyinnit videos bro so funny
Hardest mod? *violent slimecicle god flashback*
Your next goal should be to.get a dragon
The way Charlie get blown to pieces by The tower and just looks at the camera
Why did Tommy actually drop bars tho
This should be the new smp with all the old dream smp members
22:20
16:08
Boffy
NO SCHLATT DONT SACRIFICE JAMBO
Rip fuck world and the other one
That cat is the best character.
17:47 Tommy, that was very close... (Germany)
R. I. P. Fuckworld
Charlie: Its simple, it’s simple! Either, one your going to bed, or, two-  Jshlatt: AAHHHHHHH!!  Charlie: -you’ll be torn apart by a shadow ghoul. 7:46
Rip fuckworld and rip the other one
15:49 On that time, there are two reapers, and after that the two wolves jshlatt has, or however you spell it, I can’t spell his name, died, maybe those reqpers weren’t for them but for the wolves
If this was hardcore they’d be so fucked
Lol
Love it
7:49 had me dying
Fun fact. while you can't spawn the battle tower boss via a spawn egg, you can summon it using this command "/summon battletowers:golem" Have fun with that.
Jojos Bizarre Adventure remix less gooo
Pee pee poo poo
We're not safe anywhere😂😂😂
The dog died😢  R.i.p fuckworld😢
When y’all saw the one eyed thing that makes you blind in the tower I immediately imagined Charlie seeing it and crying in a corner because in his rlcraft video he saw it and told condi to take his life before it could take his eyes and that is my absolute favorite slimecicle quote
7:38
7:20
6:19
23:23
Tommy wtf why did you play journey from the destiny 2 soundtrack
You guys should do more videos like this. This one was actually entirely entertaining.
what was that opening song :P
the giorno theme is amzing
Rip fuckworld-
I am rewatching this a year later and it is so said when jshlatt starts crying cause the dog dies
Do you watch jojo because the beginning music is jojo
This makes me realize how much easier it would have been to clear those towers if my friend was with me. I did it fxcking solo.
o7 fuckworld and the other one
new title: "I died 100 times in Minecraft's Hardest Mod!"
and i thought my zombie apoclyaps mod was super hard (dont mind my spell)
I’ve got slusans balls
18:07 was so wholesome <3
i love how quickly tomm & elodie gave up on censoring the f bombs lol
"His name is Fuckworld, now he is dead, I don't have enough skill to eat this bread, my name is Tommyinnit I'm here to say, we lost Fuckworld in another way. Another day, another day, another Dream dollar we've gotta get to the tower so we can hit holler. Holler? Holler isn't the name of a girl. Holler is the name of m-"
Schlatt: AHHHH WHAT THE FUCK Tommy: AHH WHAT THE FUCK Charlie: OH FUCK
.
I’m so happy tommy did a Zelda reference🫶. Idk why but it makes me so happy🤌
schlatt:*falls in the floor* Tommy:SCHLATT WHERE ARE YOU Schlatt::i fell through the floor   :D
Rip fucked world  and the other one 💔
rip fuckworld
this was from 2 years ago now 2023 and im still laughing at this
Bro dropped the hardest intro and thought we wouldn’t notice
The community reference wait-
30:12
Tommy: SCHLATT WHERE ARE YOU Schlatt: I'm in the wall :D
Rip fuckworld
16:31 NOOOOO FUCKWORLD NOOOOOOOOOO 16:31
I like how some of the things they said came full circle
11:57 flashbacks to when schlatt used to call that tower Trump Tower
25:20 Shlatt becomes a monkey
RIP Fuckworld  RIP other dog
WHY DOES SHLATT HAVE A FULL SIZED POPE!!!
10:35 they drink at the same time
i remember when schlatt played rl craft with Technoblade
i never plan on unsubscribing to you keep unsubscribing the good content nd have a good day  stay safe and reliable
14:31   "He's in the walls. HE'S IN THE GODDAMN WALLS!"
9:58 love it😂😂😂🤣🤣
I need to know what the songs used towards the end are
part 2 plssss
6:17  Jambo: "What the heck is going on here?"
That tower reminded "Shlatt" of old times.
-No one -Literally not a soul -JSchlatt offering his cat to the strange cardboard cut out of a pope I don't know the name of:
when lux jengu died i started crying it was the saddest death i have ever seen in media
I love how Charlie foreshadowed what was going to happen at the start of the video. He told Schlatt to make sure he doesn’t step on any pressure plates without think first. Then Schlatt sacrificed himself, fuckworld, and the other one due to a pressing plate.
Jshlatt: I fell through the floor *Dead inside smile* Me: I feel you man lmao
Hi tommy
How ironic it was a pressure plate that killed the dog
Why is tommy confused he played with boffy like 3 years ago
I dont think hes gonna make another video
Tommy&Charlie: He's thinkin bout some fucked up shit.   Jshlatt: c a t
11:17 Schlatt warns Charlie to be careful with the bow --> 13:07 Charlie accidentally shoots Schlatt with the bow  2:01 Charlie warns Schlatt not to ignore pressure plates + 13:32 Schlatt falls through the floor --> 16:26 Schlatt ignores pressure plates and falls through the floor  For a non-scripted video, there sure is a lot of foreshadowing.
I jus love these vids
19:33 is that a Community reference or am I uncultured?
why in the thumbnail he have red dragon armor?😂
11:10 that's what she said
Jshlatt: *cat is my offer*  Cats title: Bro wtf-
4:13  4:39
6:41 That moment schlatt thorn entered the chat.
17:16 Tommy has evolved into Chicken
Tommy: Today we only have one goal Also Tommy: lists 2 goals
These guys always find a way to make anyone smile
Fuckworld will forever live in our memory 😔 RIP fuckworld 🪦 👇
That was actually a pretty good rap
You should do a 100 days video and I only liked because you used a jojo theme song
The best rap ever "his name was fuckworld now he is dead I don't have enough skill to eat this bread"   schlatt cry about his dog
tommy i don’t think it’s youtube unsubbing lol
R.I.P fuckworld and the other one
Poor schlatt
That is the Tower Boss, Not a dungeon Boss. A real boss compared to that thing, would be dragons
7:05 the poor cat not know wtf is going on 😂😂🤣
in the beginning schlat was talking about hoe the pressure plate was for the door and charlie said never make that assumption again then when fuck world died he stepped on a pressure plat probably assuming its safe
His name was fuck world now he is dead  I dont have enough skill to eat this bread, why did it go well 😢
Rip fuckworld Died too soon
26:54 in the Cadillac
16:25 Charlie was right about Schlatt stepping on a pressure plate and dying immediately.
Where is the part 2
I love “Journey” from the destiny 2 ost
10:15
I from Vietnam :)
7:37-7:58 pure horror on Jschlatt face
16:57 this face is priceless.
i have not slept. it is 7:00 AM and I am watching fricking tommyinnot for hells sake
RLcraft looks like something from a old horror indie horror game
im gay but no one will know:)
NOOO THE WOLVES
Forge labs:pathetic
go to the lost city and you'll see the true hell
I dont have enough skill to eat this b r e a d
The monsters: 3:34 Spriggans shoot poison lasers and usually spawn whenever a crop is destroyed. 4:15 Krakes move very fast, but they only attack if you hurt them or if you sprint near them. 5:06 Nymphs occasionally heal you if you're nearby. 7:37 Reapers attack sleeping players and inflict a custom Fear effect that messes up your movement. 9:28 Jengus spawn in water and attack any player nearby by firing water-spawning projectiles.  - They drop these projectiles on death, which is why Jschlatt was able to throw them at Tommy & Charlie in 10:15. 14:35 Striders (no, not the nether kind) spawn in water and attack players by picking them up and dealing constant damage. 14:48 Rocs just... pick players up whenever they feel like it. 22:49 Geists appear whenever an undead creature dies and inflict several debuffs on nearby players. When killed, they leave behind purple fire that causes the Wither effect. 23:17 Chupacabras spawn in caves and heal whenever they attack another creature. 23:23 Gnekks are devil-like creatures that inflict the Poison effect. 25:35 Ventoraptors are fast-moving bird creatures that can be tamed as mounts.  Those are all the mobs I've seen from the _Lycanite's Mobs_ mod of the RL Craft modpack.
Slimecicle warned Schlatt to never assume the pressure plates are not for anything more than just a door...  and look what ended up happening.
For a mod called "RLCraft" (real life), it's not very realistic. I can't remember the last time I saw a lobster demon outside my house in the river.
We should get a series of y’all playing RL Craft Together❤
7:37 🤣🤣
If Schlatt respawned immediately I think maybe both dogs would’ve lived
I swear 6:20 with schlatt getting struck by lightning was hilarious. Especially after when he turned to the pope cut out behind him 😭
I find the death of fuckworld amusing
my fav thing for charlie to say i'am how to train you dragon
its been 2 years tommy and you got 13.9 mil subs where the rl craft
RIP Fuckworld
3:26 church bells 5:08 hey there 6:27 God was affronted 8:12 “upgrade my mouth”
17:50 has me literally crying
*Fundy has left the chat if hardest mod maker*
I love how when announcing the mod Charlie just gets sniped by the ultimate aim bot skeleton😂😂😂🤣🤣🫵
i genuinely cannnot believe this was posted TWO YEARS AGO, i loved this video lol
7:48 22:48  Charlie: Its simple 1 either go to bed, or 2 get torn apart a shadow ghou-  *shadow ghoul appears outta no where*  Schlatt: AHHH AHHHH AHHH  *Tommy and Schlatt kills skeleton and zombie*  They turn into the undead  Tommy Schlatt and Charlie: WHAT THE WHAT WAS THAT AHAHAHAHHA   honestly i laughed so hard i couldnt breath😂😂😂😂
Ngl but I think that dog is anti-simetic now
5:26 that sounds so weird out of context😂
What's the name of the song in the beginning
More>:)
Why did it look like Charlie was naked?
The song for the dogs are from destiny but rest in peace dogs
Hello Tõmmÿîńñīt
Rip fworld
15:35 how to train your dragon had me dead
30min? Wow thought it was 2
I've played RL craft and when I first played it was a f*cking nightmare😅
I can’t believe you guys played RLCRAFT without me
The funny thing is slime has the right to be so worried because RLCraft really is that cruel
The 30 minutes I spent watching this was a rollercoaster of emotions and I don’t regret it.
PLEASE MORE RL CRAFT
17:06 only true destiny 2 players know this theme song playing in the back ground...
Tommyinnit: I Survived Minecraft's Hardest Mod! Fundy: Am I a joke to you?
IVE PLAYED RL CRAFT ITS SO HARD BRO-
part 2 when
Minecarft isn't hard, it makes me har-
Basically elden ring
9:30 did not age well..
this would be so funny with proximity chat
3:18 PFFFFFFFFFF
Me casually playing Rlcraft and hears "It's so hard" in the background as I just proceed to melt a dragon with nunchakus.
0:09 : Today, we only had _1_ goal: *_then proceeds to list 2 goals_*
What’s the seed of this world?
17:55 that sound like an intro beat 🤨
Tommy and it cuts down trees slime i runs in the way 4:39
this is hilariously!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  make more of these  :)
Which dungeon boss? There is lots of them
Get your F for fuckworld here  👇
hi tommy I have just started streaming and im only 11 and can u give me some
lmao schlatt sacrificed his cat im dying🤣
i like the intro song
Does anyone know the song name at 29:03?
why does slime sicle sound like eminem when hes rapping 18:31
Jojo GOLDEN WIND
The moment you realise the dog is good enought to wear clothes but you're not.
The first time I watched this video was on the day it released and that was the day after my dog died
Fukworld, the supreme version of Juiceworld
Not fuckworld😢😂
The way Schlatt speed ran the Lords prayer then sacrificed the cat to the pope-
It is the hardest mod pack but they picked the easiest boss
Feminist Straight Tommy vs Misoginist Gay Sclatt,  My favorite duo
Schlatt looks like he's sacrificing Jambo to the Motivational Lizard.
Thism reminds me of popularmmos
27:41 its*
Love this vid bro
they all get on each others nerves till the dog in danger  true homies edit: noooooo the dogs
you still need to kill a dragon
Why did you put the Jo Jo’s theme song for the diginign of the video
Literally a continuation of slime’s old video
Standard day in ohio
Part 2?
even tho i do not like schlatt. he has the best scream
It’s so funny seeing them struggle with the Krake after I figured out during one of my playthroughs that they’re sensitive to noise or something of the matter and Just  Basically if you don’t sprint most will leave you alone 💀💀
I cried when the dogs died 😭
rip fuckworld
"i'm not skilled enough to eat this bread" 💀
Tommyinnite: aahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  Jschlatt: I’m in a wall
Me when schlatt's dog died : I guess you could say thst fuckworld fucked up
tom i’m coming to you a year later to say you’ve gotten lots subscribers and the people want another rlcraft video
this is very entertaining while im just clalmy in rl craft just brewing my whines and peacefully farming lol
Charlie: I’m pretty sure god was affronted by something we said  Schlatt:*prays for his life and offers his cat as a sacrifice to the cardboard pope*   6:25
I LOVE YOU TOMMYYYYY(:))
10:17
please give me shoutout
Totally do a hundred days
You guy should play more rlcraft and tame a dragon if you can't do it ask technoblade & dream help
Jschlatt should have respawned bec the dogs thought he was still there
For anyone wondering, the music at 26:30 is Open Frenzy/Storms before the Cataclysm by Dm Dokuro, as I was certain I heard it there, but little else seemed to recognise it.
All of you are funny
"family friendly"
the monsters look like they're straight out of stranger things..
ma guys said surviving the hardest mod and also dying 500 times
I love how tommy and schlatt are like newbies and slime is a mentally unstable extremely paranoid man who has been on the islands for 45 years
when slimesicle said HEYHEYHEYHEYHEY In the beginning he sounded like freddie mercury 😭
9:52 that did not age well
The real mc is shlats cat
Rlcraft isn't a mod it's a mod pack
hamilton level raps from charlie slimecicle
Charlie slimesicle is the next eminem

i saw this video the monring after I got very drunk for the first time and admitted many bad thing to my friends and cried about how bad my coming out as trans to my parents went. I am, once again, slightly drunk, so sorry about this (if you somehow see it). Today has been nostlagic. i went from my parents attic. I haven't had a hyperfixztion on your channel for almost two years but the time that I did was the worst time of my life. No fault of your own obviously. I feel so depressed watching this, the fact that I felt so disgusting and had no control of my life when warchign this for the first time and it hasn't changed. i don't know how to feel. Nothing is different but I'm going to university next academic year. Thought I'm not sure I can get in. i haven't studied because  I haven't felt real, I have had schizophrnic symptoms since the end of 2019. Unofrtunatwly, you and wilbur soot have become thee centre of my delusions for about two years.  i think that's why I applied to sussed but I don't know. being drunk makes me realise that I actually am fucked in the head and it isn't a stupid bit that makes my friends laugh. i sont think ill get over you, even if I'm cringing zt the fact that i ever watched your content. unfortunately you were the biggest thing in my life when my mental health went to zero. I'm fucked.
Guys, why does Charlie kinda sound like enenem when he’s rapping.
"That's an s-tier weapon here in united kingdom" What a gentleman
u need shaders bro
Funfact: itsfunneh played this mod a long time ago
hearing Charlie so stressed and Tommy so calm at the beginning is fucking amazingly hilarious
Rip Jambo, may he be with lightning and be confused why the hell Schlatt picked him up and brought him to a cardboard man.
I stopped enjoying this just because they suffered so much 😢 also the dogs dying just broke my heart 😢
Fuckworld😢❤❤❤❤
I would *love* to see a 100 day rl craft video
Fuckworld!!!!!
I haven’t even started the video yet and I already know nobody survived
Fuckworld was fire
7:45 schlatt: ahhh finally relaxatioAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
It took me over a year to watch this because I wasn't skilled enough
6:17 elppa?
Charlie: gotta get to the top get a shield and a bow we just can't stop tommy:woahhh  Schlatt:woahh  Tommy:Shut up! Charlie:ok
Aye, congrats on hitting 12ML!
u got alot of subscribers sooooooo.. part 2 time!!
Copyright with the Demogorgon..
why does the fuckworld death scene always make me emotional
I on,y watched this cause I saw a dragon, who else?
I love how the first five minutes are like :”OH MY GOD!!! WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT!?!?!??”
I like when Charlie breaks out his autotune at any point
RIP fuckworld we will miss you
Gnekk was after their nekks
Imagine doing this in hardcore.
Thou shalt not take of the Lord your God in vain. If you do God will not hold him guitless.
my av character in the whole video: the cat who said bro wtf?
new season of Stranger Things is hilarious!
4:39 WOAH It's coming down!  *Proceeds to get underneath it*
I’ve rewatched this so many times
I love how charlie sounds like he has DEEP war time ptsd in very beginning 🤣
wow tommys a good rapper
They killed the rocc roccs are like your best friends once you captured em alive
Poor Slimesicle is traumatized
omg i remember my chilhood youtuber you gave me nostalgia..-
Probably my favorite Tommyinnit Video of ALL time. Perfection. :)
Terraria masochist malice getfixedboi:  *Yes*
17:15 he laughed like a gosh darn chicken
So when you said "I SURVIVED minecraft's hardest mob" what exactly did you mean by that?
I used to like slimcicle
Slimecicle just having ptsd this entire video
Do it again
I choked watching this This is too funny!! 🤣🤣🤩
i always laugh whenever i watch your videos, keep up the great work! ( congrats on 11 mil btw)
W JoJo Music
The JoJo in the beginning really set the vibe
Man I want this video but if phillza was here
man, i feel sad for u, u just lost 1000k  subs
Tommy: he's thinking about some fucked up shit Schlatt: [just hugging jambo]
tommy dropping bars tho
bru
The Waffle house had found it's new host
4:38 I literally thought my phone was tilting
R.I.P Fuckworld
Jschlatt: The pressure plate is for the door, dumbass. Also Jschlatt 25 minuted later: *gets killed by the same thing*
them presure plates really got him huh
I love how you can tell the goop man is still traumatized from his RLcraft video
"so it was true then...fuck world" Hardest line in the video
16:30 when real men cried
"It's a Chupacabra! Their real!"
Would be cool to have you all do a RLCraft series
Respect to The likers and n-respect the dislikers because this is THE HARDEST MOD.
so, by "survived" you mean die 3 times and then cry to sleep at night. Got it.
So many threat's and yet... The biggest threat is...a skeleton with aimbot
I love this kind of videos from tommy
This is not a mod and instead a mod pack fyi
I played with this tower mod in 1.5.2! The tower is exactly the same! No change whatsoever. It's a time trip seeing it here.
I "survived" Minecraft's hardest mod is not exactly an accurate title
By the time it takes the video to load in this computer I'm spending at least 2 hours watching it
just wait until he finds nomifactory or gregtech
I Survived Minecraft's Hardest Player...
Jschlatt: somehow getting tons of shit he should not have tommy: "wow this is neat" "oh charlie look!" *shows off new tech the schlatt already has somehow*  charlie: rightfully paranoid
2:35 violet.
i Watch this video like once a week!! it’s my comfort vid lol! so funny. i love how serious charlie is when he’s making jokes hehehe!! my fav trio
RIP Fuckworld the rapper 🕊🕊🕊 and may he live in a better place
Fuck world:MVP										the other one: ….
o7 to the dog rapper
It would be great if you guys do that!
Rip F***world❤ rest in peace
charlie: I'm pretty sure god was affronted by something we said... Schlatt: *slowly turns back to a cardboard piece of a priest* Also Schlatt: *starts praying*
I respect Schlatt being 'business casual' during a fucking apocalypse
Schlatt: exist  God: and I took that personally
The are u inspired by kanie joke has aged idk in which way it just has
i would watch this as a 3 player rlcraft series
wait, we have dragons IRL?
Sick of this it’s not that hard
Lol. Charlie:  Hey thats my posture!  Monster: *starts ti attack*
Do you mean trum(bone) skeleton
Much love
nah but the remix of the JJBA music, SLAPS
9:52 that didnt age well
Schlatt: Am I having a heart attack? Me: not again...
Scat sacreficed the soup
Me :expecting the usual music  The intro: *starts playing the intro to Jojos Bizarre Adventure*
I know I'm late but at 6:20 the subtitles literally spell out a Polish surname lmao
Nice vid
May fuckworld rest in peace.
My favorite quote Bro whyis the wolf skilled enough to wear clothes but I'M NOT ?
part 2 when
U dident exactly “survive”
I love how Charlie was getting flashbacks the entire video and he is traumatized from previously playing
Tommy Du you dringk drugs
Where is part 2 of this ???
R.I.P f**kworld f**k the world
I love the Mario music
rlcraft is the mod that i play almost every day and I love it it's just so realistic 😭😀
sup
Charlie is my favorite person he’s giving my vibes 🤩
Can someone please tell me the name of this mod 😁
Rip f*** World rest in peace
JAMBO NOOOOOO
Still waiting on part 2 with sneegsnag bro
Charlie: mumbling*  Tommy: Charlie take the potion!  Chalrie: take the potion?  Charlie explodes*  Stares at camera*  Me: 😂
we arent safe ANYWHERE - slimesicle, not safe
That was a sick intro 😮
Rest in peace fuck world
remember when tommyinnit played rlcraft with boofy 3 years ago...
you know shits hard when even charlies taking this seriously
XD at the beginning u guys were just saying what the F$^# is that
6:17
this is literally just new generation popularmmos
17:52 - 18:31 I Love how Tommy just copied Schlatt-
“FUCK YOU LUX JENGU” is my favourite schlatt quote
“Please enjoy this video, BECAUSE WE DID NOT.” Got me good.
29:55 the smile was personal
the funny thing is that he went over a presserplate and died RIP jhlat
"We need to destroy the tower"-Tommyinnit
Grass laaazaaars
Part 2 when
"to defeat the dungeon boss!" thats like one of the easiest bosses...
1:25 Schlatt foreshadowed it
Tommy : This is the hardest mod in minecraft Fundy : Hold my beer
13:18 russia during ww2.
18:07 Soup moment
Tommy:hey there s’xy. Tommy:oh you don’t have a face-
the second i sa the creeper i thought of the song were you go see GOD
i love the jojo music
oh my god guys we're almost at an astounding 10 subscribers
Funny when wolve die
no one : litterally no one:     schlatt: i fell throught the floor  tommy and charlie: 'dying'
Schlatt: “Am I having a heart attack?” *DSMP FLASHBACKS*
This video hits different
0:26 Jojo mode activated 🗿

23:16 got me laughing even more bro
SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT THIS FUCKING SONG IS ITS SUCH A FUCKING BANG
1 year passed since this video uploaded and im still watching it like in every month,making me cry that much laugh on it. R.I.P Fuck world
Jojo reference
"man's got a shank!"  -Tommyinnit, 2021
Tommy is only 18 and he already is at 11 million. He is growing so fast
the jojo music
BRO I STARTED GETTING BACK INTO THE DREAM SMP AGAING

Schlatt’s screaming in this episode was so genuine, I have never seen anything scare him so badly
2:01 😂💀
Rest In Peace fuckworld.  I cried at that part :(
fgtyasbgnhuimnxeghfyausfe
Fundy be like: are u sure about that?
but the funniest thing is that boss is like lvl 1 xD
And the funniest part is the dungeon boss is one of the weakest bosses
MAKE A SERIES
Alternative title: Charlie has ptsd for almost 31 minutes
Jesibia schlatt cuddling jambo>you
Tommy: Killed by a child Charlie: Killed by a tree Schlatt: Struck by lightning
No one is talking about fuckworld 😭
The lore behind this.....
RIP fuckworld
He said "HARD," just like my di-  >:3
Schlatt dismissed a pressure plate and that is what kill his dogs, the irony is real
Jshclatt: owns a cat Also Jshclatt: gets attached to 2 video cat
i got a rap for fuckworld yeah he died but we reside by his side
Also this lol 7:50
7:38 the fuck-
00:00 you look like a dog😂
Tommy and Charlie: *fighting for dear life*  Schlatt: “I fell through the floor” :D
Youtube can't unsubscribe me if I don't subscribe in the first place.

Schaltts screams fuel me
mad world, juice wrld, FUCK world

Mans got a shank innit bruv
me being mental broken, startes to cry when fuckworld died and everyone was sad
Make a sequel
NOW IN HARDCORE!
This just reminds me of krew craft
Charlie and Schlatt were the best parts about this video!
This video is literally Tommy and Schlatt discovering what fear is and Charlie rediscovering his PTSD from last time he played RLcraft.
Rip f world 😭
RLCraft is definitely something
like tommyinnit says fuck this mod
Rip "fuckworld"
Can we just appreciate how epic TommyInnit intros are
Jschlatt: i fell through the floor"  Welcome to the backrooms big man.
I guess fuckworld got.. fucked by the world
E
Rlcraft has to be the most misleading name ever, the " RL " in the name stands for " Real Life " while only 2% of the mod is real, the rest does not exist at all
Everyone: **struggling to fight a giant horde of zombies that has stolen all of their stuff** Schlatt: I fell through the floor
I love how the intro song is golden wind, it makes it so dramatic.
6:50  16:08  18:07
they only named 1 dog so they decided to call him the other one
Jambo noooooo
7:49💀
MORE!!!!!!!
nice
the rapidly ascending amount of "hoo"s got to me
6:37 LMAO!!!
He will be missed
hey there beautiful- you dont have a face...
I Laughed fucking my ass with fuckworld and I'm a kid
16:31 FINALLY
Giorno’s theme at the start?
bals
Survive: ❌ Kill the dungen: ✔
Schlatt: I brought cake Charlie: oh cool, can I eat this am I skilled enough. I think I'm gonna need to upgrade my mouth  Possibly the funniest thing slimecicle has said in this entire recording session
6:18
The very top of the tower must have like netherite and diamond armor
Not Schlatt looking over at the cardboard cutout 😭😭
Ez just build up and use a fishing rod to him
this is why i love tommy,charile,and jshlat
“ aww I got some crack” - Tom Simons
destiny 2 music when doggo died
0:25 : pls insert jojo's bizarre adventures music pls
this RLCraft mod reminds me of demogodon monster in stranger things
18:30 they made a song on spotify from this😂
W
myślałam że schlatt ma Jana Pawła ll xd
um are you sure that's the hardest mod ever because its not. the hardest mod is the parasite mod, you should play it. ps don't let the parasite get to its last form it will crash the game, just so you know.
6:47 got me rolling
My god this is the cutest jschlatt moment 18:08
7:46 This is pure comedy man omg 💀
how do i get this mod it seems poggers

More

Charlie’s guide to PTSD!
1 British guy and 2 American guys love this

Hey tommy try playing it again your fun to watch😆
7:50 He desperate was so funny 17:41 fuck world.....😔
I Fell the pain for fuckworld and schlatt
I think this is the most epic tommy intro ever 😂
Did anyone notice the Destiny red war campaign music at 17:26
*RIP FUCKWORLD*
I love how during the first attack on the tower, Schlatt just noclips into The Backrooms while Tommy and Charlie are getting murdered
can you do it more people like tubbo,phil,ranboo etc.
real title: Tommy waits for Charlie to do everything and protect him while shlatt doesn't listen to charlie
The last part got me so good lol
I love how they just don't use the xp from the spawners in the tower
Its sad that nobody heard Schlatts joke about knives being S-Tier weapons in the UK.
Yes!! :)
Was i the only one that noticed that Tommy used a hat in time music in his video?
He used jojo songs
Me: “ ok now let me just */gamemode creative* “
30 min and you guys killed just a golem Disappointed 😞
A skeleton + a trumpet = Sans.
I want to see more of tommy and friends suffering in rl craft
you said ur going to do it again but where is the vidio
I just realized that around 17:30 you can hear Journey from Destiny 2
hello if u see this pls shout me out
RIP fuckworld
Bro Slimecicle got some bars
MORE RLCRAFT!!!!!!!!!!!
Y’all’s swear… like a lot
Famous last words   Oh it’s comeing down -Slimecicle
I needed to say something, and even though I hate knowing this, it needs to be said:    When jschlatt fell for the chest trap, the second dog survived for longer than the first one. This probably means Fuckworld fell in second, meaning if jschlatt respawned faster, he could have saved Fuckworld.
R.I.P Fuck world and the other one...
R.I.P fuckworld
5:39  ❤️"I got dogs!!🤗"  He sounded so happy, wth😭
9:00 this was a reference to Schlatt’s dubbing of the Chimera from Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood on the Anime Dub Bootcamp
The dungeon boss looks a little sus
Mod-Pack*
rip fuck world
8:07 Too the people who know the song to that music Me too LMAO
When you go to Australia
Perfect combo of funny people!
I really wish you guys would do a full series on this
I played it and it was fun 😆😆😆
No way this is a year old, i fell like I first watched it yesterday when it was posted, this is actually insane, bro

R.I.P Technoblade

“His name was f*ckworld and now hes dead, i dont have enough skill to eat this bread” THAT WAS AN ACTUAL BOP 💀
Hi Tommy, Epic video, I love your Channel. Like if you love Tommy

7:50 Grim reaper scares Schlatt
19:46 It said Shroud coffee, like Tommy's spider
Tommy: hes thinking about some F-ed up shit Schlatt: *Kisses Jambo*
"Please enjoy this video, BECAUSE WE DID NOT!!!"
I was watching random stuff and I saw TommyInnit face on Prestons wall
POV: your sitting on your bed watching this and you dad walks in right as Tommy yells F*CK!
I love were Charlie and Tommy tried to cheer up jchlatt
Bro jchlatt actually cried About fuckworld RIP fuckworld
Jschlatt: sacrificing he's cat to god  Cat: ayo wtf is goin on
Some legend says Tommyinnit is the biggest YouTuber until YouTube Unsubscribes us
16:30 to 17:01 were the saddest moments of this video  It was jschlatt when the second one fell in  this world is cruel
RIP FUCK WORLD
Heres something you could of done. Keep inventory on.
I love how jschlatt ignoring pressure plates came full circle

tommy: why is there a pressure plate Schlatt: its for the fucking door dumb ass Charlie: never make that assumption ever again  PreasurePlate: Ill make you suffer 20 minutes later schlatt NOOOOO FUCKWORLD HE DIED IT WAS A TRAP THERE WAS A FUCKING PRESSURE PLATE
ger theme in the start means somthing bad
Tommyinnit literally uses jojo music
17:56 🔥🔥🔥
Seems I'ma have to listen to doja after I binge watch tommy to sleep
No SIMPS
lLAIGHWING😳
Schlatt saying, "Big House" was so funny to me for no reason.
haha noob noob
im sorry but slimesicle can be pretty fucking annoying
BRUH THE SAME TIME JSCHLATT SAID "WHO IS SMELLY" I JUST FINISHED FARTING😭
I love this kinds of dumb shit videos
Didnt even kill Asmodeus smh
A good description of RLcraft is “One second your on you way to work the next your on fire”
7:50 timestamp for Schlatt's scream
Aparently 10:13 Is the most replayed????
wow this was a year ago
Rip fuckworld
I think sclat wont play again
16:57 priceless look on Tommies face
Tell dream about this mod en change gamemode to hardcore
his name was fuckworld now he ded i dont have enough skil to eet dis bred

He could have saved one of his wolves just by responding
PLEASE DO THIS MOD AGAINNN IT WAS SO FUN TO WATCH

Lol rl craft is harder 😂🤣                       (It’s a joke)
I don't know if this is the same mods, but this whole thing is giving me popularmmos flash backs, and now I'm sad :(
*Dog died*  The guys: LETS DROP SOME BARS BOYS!!!!
“i cant sleep in a dry bed” 😂😂😂😂 jesus fuck
Schlatt did some serious praying after he got killed by lightning
Pls yes
18:07 Tommy: He's thinking of some fricked up stuff! Schlatt: *petting his cat*
LESSON 1: WE’RE NOT SAFE ANYWHERE
I love this video!!
Schlatt is like one of the emo kids in south park when rapping. :P
Fun fact: RLCraft is a modpack, not a mod.
Which mod is this?
7:36 THIS SCREAM IS THE LAST THING I WANT TO HEAR WHEN I AM GETTING MURDERED 🤗(in-game of course🤣)
Tommy: Shlatt fight it!!  Jshlatt: -crying- Why are you asking me to fight it?!?!
*Charmander who? I only know ROC-mander*
What is the song from the intro called?
Istg how do I not know about all these vids
Goat : Am i having a heart attack?  yes, yes you are mr.goat.
F### WORLD
Tommy, the title says SURVIVED, I don't know if this qualifies as surviving.
Hey there beautiful oh you have no face-tommyinit
I saw this mod before, its painfully hard
Play this with boffy again
gnek the neck
Theres a harder one called apocalypse by fundy
rip fuck world
Why did Charlie just look at the camera and smile and how is he mostly calm in the most terrifying moments💀
Not the cat😂
it would be amazing to see SneegSnag and Tommy play RL craft together ^^
R.I.P FUCKWORLD 2022 😔
R.I.P fuckworld R.I.P the oTher one

Jschlatt being in S O U P was adorable!
Charlie: so either 1. You have a wonderful dream, in the most comfortable bed, and experience every fantasy you love. Or 2- Jshlatt: AAAAAAAAAAA (continues screaming until ultimate demise)
Bro i was playing fifa then the next rhin i hear is NO FUCK WORLD
21:49 I love how the Long Sword actually looks long and hard looking while crafting.
Schlatt's inability to click respawn got both his dogs killed rip
RRCraft isn't one mod, it's a mod pack.
You should do a full series
Rip the other one
LOVED THIS VID!
5:00
God loves you he’s coming back soon this is a sign to turn to him spread the word of god (not forcing)
Is nobody talking about the rap thing, that was awsome
this has to be the most ive EVER LAUGHED in a single video
11 mil
23:16 I love how Charlie sounded like he was having a Evangelion level existential crisis over a Chupacabra.
What is the mod called
8:30
What mod is this I think 🤔 I want it
And now play it hardcore
I might be late, but I really would like a hardcore series :)
7:50 i swear this monster thing scared the shit outta me
SO THIS, is how humanity started out.
You deserve this pain no all you deserve is a girlfriend
When you realize that the battletower boss is  SUSYY bAKA
I love how the jojo music in the back is playing with tommy talking it's just PERFECT...
scared schlatt be like: 7:49
Shlatt:Aww thank God Monster:YO WASS UP MY GUY Shlatt: AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH

Rip fuckworld and the other one
25:18 Jschaltt returns to monkey
I tought this mod is easy as the boys are just a donger brain which makes tommy's video fun... But when i try the mod its not bad........   I just died to a sea serpent,dragon,monsters,krakes,thirst. in just 5 seconds
Yo the rap was kinda fire though
i love how it was just like LIVE KILL IT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA KILL IT I DIED and then when a dog dies and its like anime hhaahhahahahaahhaha and then you just rap mg so funny
Jschlatt: *Gets smited*  Tommy:"What happened!"  Charlie:"Tommy,for the life of me I could not tell you but I think God was affronted by something we said."  Jschlatt: *Turns to look at the pope*
You know that poppularmosses did this mod and killed all the mobs
Gojo references at the beginning tho-🤣
you are toksic
ъоу аре тоцсиц
We need more RLCraft content
23:24 was best part ever🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Oh wait- OH WAIT- HE DID THIS MOD BEFORE- with uhhhhh Boffy Lmaoooo it’s been months since this was released and I only comment it now??? 😂😂
16:33  this is actually both the saddest and funniest arc of this video  i sat here laughing my dumb ass off for like 4 minutes
"His name is fuckworld and he is dead" "I dont have enough skill to eat this bread" Best bars ever
I’m sorry- I just died of laughter when Schlatt fell in the lava trap Then he’s face is just like, ugh AND THEN WHEN FUCKWORLD JUST FOLLOWS AND GOES TO SWIM IN LAVA WITH HIM-  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 HIS FACE IS PRICELESS 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
100 days in rl craft would be AWESOME. your apperance on slimes 100 days vid was so cool. i wanna see you do one of your own
Let's name your house the “G-spot”
Tommy, this isn't a mod, it's a modpack. The difference is that a mod pack is multiple mods in one.
Dam the boss music slaps
1st the dungeon boss is not hard  2nd the thumbnail just looks like the Ice and Fire Mod 3rd why not beat the enderdragon, asmodias, Ravovard and Asmodias?
:00 jojo intro :00009
0:24 -  0:34
Does anyone know what this modpack is?
bingus
bruuuuhhhh
funnyone 7:02
He didn't sacrifice jambo so God took matters into his own hands
Not me rewatching and hearing the intro music and be like that souing kinda like Jojo
I love the Jojo’s Bizarre Adventures theme song remix🥰🤩
I love how these three probably played this mod for over an hour, and did not come across a single dragon in the shown video. That is honestly probably really lucky.
Charlie: So it was true then, fuck- Youtube: GRAMMERLY
I love how the first 5-10 minutes are always censored, after that there's no point in trying
part way through the video sims 4 music started playing😆
I liked how schlatt just finds religion in the middle of a recording
this is absolute chaos Tommy 😂😂😂😂
What’s the music called at the start
Tom: "We have 1 goal, we have to kill the dungeon boss AND survive."  Me: Um... That's 2
"im pretty sure god was affronted by something we said"    Schlatt: *looks at cardboard cut out of priest.*
Ye you "survived" alright
Thank you tommyinnit for making this video you really made my day!!😁😁
Rip f*** world
title i survived mc hardest mod... u died like 69420 times '
jschlatt : i like this mod *wolves die* I HATE THIS MOD *sobs*
rip fuck world :C
6:55 NOT JAMBOO
What mod is this?
This is actually the funniest video I’ve seen 😭🤣
Charlie: Hey Everyone how's it going? Oh ok Nice.  Why did that line get me?
What’s the mod called?
Schlatt’s wolves dying was entirely his fault. He could have saved them if he just respawned as they would have come back to him. However he decided to just sit dead in the lava and let his wolves follow him to their deaths
o7 f world :(
rl craft yeees
That's like boinic mod
I love your  fuckin videos
Charlie and Tommy: how did you get that iron helmet!!?  Jschlatt: I got dogs! ☺️
2:02 and then 16:25
Jambo gives no fucks.
When Charlie says “I can’t sleep in a dry bed” I love to imagine that whenever he goes to bed, it’s just sopping wet, just dripping with water as he drifts off into sleep.
We need a second 😆
Kill a dragon next time
Where this new one?
Rip fuckworld
I like how in each thumbnail Tommy is either dying of laughter or just dying. 😂
I came here following your collab with Slimzcicle and his 100 days. Amazing work you pulled out here :) HOWEVER! I would love to see RLCRAFT 100 days from you!
what's the intro song?? and also great vid
What was schlatt praying tell me what he was saying
JOJO
Tommy I don’t like your vids cuz you curse alot
There is no lux jengu in star wars but there is a lux bonteri and a jango fett
the intro song : TUN TUN TUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUNTUN
I am pretty sure Charlie's "so it was true then" was about the assuming thing he said earlier
You tried not dieing?
if jschlatt wasn’t dumb enough to sit on the death screen for a fucking min, the dog wouldn’t have died and teleported over to him instead
https://youtu.be/DlXoMYojd1M
RL craft is really fun for me
I remember when he played this with Boffy  😔
The boss in amongus
You survived??? lol
forge labs makes this look WAY too easy
R.I.P  fuckworld 2022-2022 ⚰️🧎😢
Jojo reference?
23:14
Just love how one wolf has a name and the other is “the other one/wolf”
Catholic: Believes in Jesus Christ Christian: Believes in the Father, the Son, and the Holy spirit, and saints "Schlatt": Believes in the Pope
When he said YouTube keeps unsubscribing people what happens if they are just unsubscribing because he’s annoying ?:(
How did you get the mod tommyinitt and I love your vids
I hope this helps squiddo in rlcraft cuz she didn't know how to drink
RL craft in a nutshell: you are not smart enough to use this bed
6:16 jshlatt was punished for drinking gods water on holy ground
becuse we did not lineis so funny
711k like doe
Bro i died when schlat got struck bye lightning then looked at the pope
For f*ckworld!
Yo what mod is this
26:38 can we just- enjoy tommys girl scream for a moment XD
When Schlatte's wolves jumped in the lava after him and died it was so sad
Trumpet skeleton 😂😂😂😂😂
Trumet skeleton 😂😂😂😂
Why did you not say most people find me anoying I love she you say that and 1 thing your not anoying
Tommy u got subs do it again
does anyone know what this mod is even called?
Remixed giornos theme is highly accurate
*jojo reference*
Breh
The beginning is a Nono referenfe
Ok
The cave man's
Respect the man for having a remix of giornos theme
why is simply giutar everywhere it so annoying
Who remembered the pain domination did this and survived
you've bee-n hit by,you've bee-n struck by a tall criminal
man's either illiterate or actually don't know that he missed the *pack* part of this "mod"
anyone know the name of the remixed jojo song in the beginning???
Jump in the---
6:29
Nnoooooo the wolfs not the wolf the wolfs  fell  into lava noooo!!
yo isnt this the jojo theme song at the beginning?
Tommy: F*CK THIS SH*T! Me: F*ck this sh*t I'm out🎵
why is there a god behind jschlattLIVE?
holy shit shlatts scream of terror with thr goul is fuckin gold XD
Charlie has fucking PTSD from his RLCraft video looool
17:16 that laugh sounds like a chicken bursting from your lungs
Omfg ever notice the longsword crafting recipe in tommy's video...
When schlatt said he fell through the floor I thought of the backrooms
schlatt: cries over a virtual square dog  the real cat on his lap: wtf
hym mtmit5bytk
Do it again plz!!!
You guys die to much
Tommy likes jojo
It is 3am here in the u.s., AND I DONT NEED MY DADS WAKING UP TO ME LAUGHING MY ASS OF. But that almost happens, EVERY time I watch, any of your vids.  You and everyone elce deserve the subscribers yall have, also f in the chat for fuck world :(

16:31 schlatts face.
Schlatt looking at the cutout of Pope Frencis after Slimecicle's comment got me
How did Schlatt get an ender queen crown which is found in a LC
in today’s mod, charlie slmccl is having flashbacks in his rlcraft while schlatt has a religious mental breakdown
is this the new legends of arceus update?
LETS GET THIS TO 1 MIL LIKES FOR FUCKWORLD!!!!

did anyone see the craft of the long sword?
Хаха ты перевёл мой комментарии на английский
1:26 *has flashbacks to c!Jshlatt’s death*
1:23 i love when schlatt understands heart attacks
Tommy has already played it but it makes sense that he doesnt remember
Dam tommy spitting facts about faqworld
Irl craft
Poor jsclatt
me, reading the title: "Oh, so we're lying then?"
Ahhh yes the mod itsfunneh and the krew used in old krewcraft old memories
dang charlie slimesicle's bars are good
hhi
RIP  fuckworld
What about an RLCRAFT SMP!!!! Comment if u do want that
When the monster came from the ceiling and schlatt started screaming I started laughing so hard  I started crying.
rip The other one, you will be missed
BRUUHHHHHHH did u start playing Journey from the Destiny 2 soundtrack at 17:03 because if so thats epic
you great but YOU DONT FUCKING SAY ITS A MODPACK OR ANYTHING
What mod is this
Tommy: he’s thinking about some fucked up shit Schlatt: *giving his cat kisses*
Tommy, what is your intro music? I love it so much. Also, I love your videos.
The funniest 31 minutes of my life
The last part was dramatic
Dude I can not imagine the dream smp with this mod 🤣😂😂🤣
That remix at the beginning. It got me vibin
"Why is the Wolf skilled enough to wear clothes, but I'm not!?" ~ Charlie 2021
Fun fact: when the first dog dies it wasent f world if jshlatt was faster he would have saved f world
HI TOBU
😢😥😢😥😢😥😥😢😥😥😥😥😢😥😢😥😢😥😢😥😢😢😥😢😢😥😢😢
cringe
lol
I didn't think tommy could actually spit bars
R.I.P fuckworld
i am a fan of you
So... when are you returning?
Is nobody gonna talk about giornos theme in the beginning?
i don't think survive is quite the word i would use here...
The Giorno's theme is the reason why I still watch Tommy's videos.
Is that a JoJo reference
When you realize giorno’s theme is playing in the background
The krake thing looks like a shreiker from tremors 2: aftershock
This should be a series called the adventures of retarded bri’ish men
Rl craft is so deadly try it playing is hardcore
Toxic man's (::::::::::::::::::::::: (:::::;;'::':::?:;;;':; j
Nobody cares about the old destiny 2 music bro I'm getting nostalgia
this is the first time i've ever seen Charlie actually being productive (at the beginning he was teaching how to play the mod)
Nobody realises how Tommy can actual spit bars
"hey there beautiful-" *flies away*
21:00 *phoenix wright music starts*
WHERE IS BOFFY!!!!!!!!!!!!
RIP fuckworld, gone but not forgotten
They Didnt Catch em.
What mod is this?
RIP FKWORLD
Congrats For 11.5Million Tommy
R.I.P Fuckworld 2021-2021
JOJO GOLDEN WIND GO BRRRRR

When you remember this mod is super easy ( i became invincible because of the ammount of hearty perk things on my armors and baubles including a regen ring etc )  👁👄👁
I want to play rlcraft so bad but my pc is trash
Mod
Kod
Can you post the link to the kod
Giorno Giovanna theme is sick af 🔥
R.I.P                    Fuckworld Fuckworld's last words: *growl*
GIORNO THEME!!!! music is fire
Eii yooo it that jojo?
The cutest thing in this video is when he tamed fuck world then the noise he maked
Jambo gets sacrificed
I’ll vento doro at the start was amazing
Annoying
TOMMY USED DESTINY 2 SOUND TRACKS YES!
He should just respawn fast then his wolf will teleport to him
How many time did Tommy say "wtf"😂😂 Also how many time did they all say "f*ckworld"🤣
RIP fuckworld and the other one they will be missed
6:45 I die 😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Not me replaying the scene of jschlatt screaming over and over again (7:35 to 8:00)  Btw I can only imagine quackity speaking with the wolf-
R.I.P Fuck world and the other one
I've seen harder than this. Ever heard of "blood and bones"? It adds another level of difficulty. Maybe you can mix the two modpacks?
7:47 the monster be like:Gud morning
jshlat just praying
What Mod Is This?
heh fundy would be  jealous
7:48 💀
Lol
*BIPEDAL LOBSTER*
Noo! Fuckworld no😭😥
What is happening right now?!
thomasinnit
I was crying when fuckWorld died
Everyone:panic         Jshlatt:s t u c k
Not me actually crying to the dog dying
Nice jojo song;)
RIP Fuckworld😟
Me who had it as easy as Shlatt
Imagine subscribing because it helps the algorithm
I love how he ised giornos theme from jojo to summon me
4:06
POV: your a jojo fan so you are singing Giornos theme at the beginning
7:38 - 7:51 jschlatt's screams had me wheezing
17:55
Them: tries to do second floor of tower Tommy and slimecicle: hyah run away run away theres so many ahhhhh Jschlatt: *casually trying to get out of the wall the entire time*
Is that a jojoooo referenceeee???
it was the creeper striking lightning
i like how at some point the editor just stopped censoring the vid XD
For who don’t know  RL stand for real life
Try killing amougalich in hardcore i did that
Is there going to be a part two?
jojo music
Yoooooo were half way to 12mil
Doing have to say anything??
17:53 "i don't have enough skill to eat this bread" i died- for absolutely no reason lmaoo
I also like how Tommy put  rip  *uck world and then rip the other one but Tommy’s first rap was pretty good tbh
I like how nobody cares that  jschlslat fell through the floor
Pls do this mod in hardcore
0:28 Whats the Song????
mc but charlie dies in water  in logic
mm me like bread
i hears de giorno theme at the beginning as a background music
is that a jojo refrence
Tommy, don't you remember doing this with Boffy?
HeY toMmYiNnIt CaN i BE iN a ViDeo?
CONGRATS ON 10 MILL
Dude I need to know who does the subtitles,  right after scholar dies of lightning fucking slimecicles subtitles LMAO
When I saw the title I survived the hardest mincraft mode it should be.i tried to survive
Tommy is so good at this game. Im still stuck on skeleton boss
Epic
ITS MODPACK NOT MOD
after watching forge labs beat this mod (he technically beat the mod)  then watching tom play was HILLARIOUS
18:41 made me choke on my water
7:49
739
7:36
this isnt orespawn
why does he sometimes censor the bad words but other times he just doesnt give a crap
Can we all just appreciate the Jojo music in the beginning of the video
0:33 now that is a jojo reference
ah yes killing boss AND surviving is ONE goal we all share
in memories of fuckworld
I thoguth slimecicle was naked
TOMMY I REMIND U AND EVERYONE TO STOP USING GODS NAME FOR NONSENSE!!! THATS A REALLY BIG SIN IF U EVER HAVE DONE THAT ASK FOR FORGIVENESS OFC TO GOD!
I love how the jojo music matches perfectly
I cant stop laughing when schlatt was trying to sacrifice his cat
TIMMY AINT ITTTTT😳😳😳😩😩😩😩✨✨✨
welcome to rlcraft! cool, where's the closest restaurant? what? you get free food here cool.   *BUT YOU FORKING NEED SKILL TO EAT LLLOOO*
i may or may not have tagged tommy 2x btw new word (shank)
R I P fuck world
the girno theam at the start lol
20:25 PTSD ensues
*giorno theme*
When charlie smiled after dying that got me the most lmfao 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Instant like for jojo music in the start
jschlatts first assumption resulted in death later on in the video
the new dark souls update lookin good
is this the divorce mod?
This is literally the best video i have ever seen
I hate that tommy cencorsed the swear words I mean in my videos I don’t cencorsed it
Tommy, how do you know the destiny 2 soundtrack!!!!
So, when’s that part 2 coming…
7:36
6:19 respecc++ to the editor for subtitling al lthat
The jojo intro was pog
2:06 16:26 Karma
I was rewatching this video and u can imagine my shock when I randomly herd “ piss on me” 😟
RL craft mod
✨its not a mistake its a masterpiece ✨
u should make a 100 days video
Schlatt: Am I having a heart attack? Me: *Uhm thing dsmp lmao*
*Tommy using Giornos theme* Me:is he a jojo fan????
*modpack
His name is fuckworld and he's dead and I don't have enough skill to eat this bread
You should do one of those 100 days rl craft with them! It will be very fun.

Modpack not mod
I think Schlatt screaming at the demon thing after waking up was unscripted lol, he had pure terror in his eyes
Jschlatt karma 2:02 - 16:25
It’s a mod PACK
Charlie just predicts what happens to schlatt so well its hilarious.
i wounder if tommy watches jojo or he just likes the golden wind song
✨It's not a mistake✨ IT'S A MASTERPIECE ✨
You should play this again, but next time play around with the ice and fire dragon mod. It'd be pretty funny to see you getting around in a stage 5 dragon brbdbfg
giorono theme intro
more of rlcraft please
I like how at the start of the video tommy and schlatt disregard all danger and Charlie’s voice is always full of worry and paranoia.
i love how me and tommy were thinking the same thing lol 20:26
17:57 Tommy is the best rapper
Rip
god I wish you'd play this again with wilbur and tubbo too that would be amazing
Shlatts scream killed me
i want you tommyinnit to play more of this
Rap is bad as it is but white boy rap, just no
Schlatt: "am i having a heart attack" well it wouldn't be the first time 😃
Girl : I cant believe the didn't cry at the titanic Girl 2 : do boys and men's even have feelings?   Boys and men's : 16:31
Jojojojojo
What's the music at 21:27
O7’s for “fuck world” and “the other one”  They were great rappers😔😔😔 O7 O7 O7 O7 O7 O7 O7 O7 O7 O7
Love the intro transition with the Jojo music
I remember when Tommy was doing this with Boffy…
18:33 this was pog innit?
Charlie's rap was quite amazing
Uhm tommy dungeon boss is not it there are plenty more also one of the hardest is level 5 dragon
R.I.P. Fuckworld      And the other one
When you have played a mode with dinosaurs:
If you don’t know what this is it is RlCraft
this would be fun if dream smp has this mod
16:07 you mean a trom"bone"
Giorno's theme just playing in the background
Technically this is a mod pack, i know like 99% these mods
Jshlatt: that pressure plate is for the door  30 minutes later: assumes pressure plate is nothing and falls into lava
Jojo song
Rip fuckworld
do a sequel
*LESSON 1: WE'RE NOT SAFE ANYWHERE MAN*     RLcraft in one phrase.
Does anyone know what the music playing at 4:26 is?
Bet dream cant beat it. MARK MY WORDS
R.I.P doggos
i've seen this video more times than nikita dragun has changed her skin color and i never realized that it's half an hour
your def gonna do it again and what  guys saw from the mod pack ye that's nothing compared to what there is to find.
The amount of sadness in Schlatt's voice when Fuckworld died brought tears to my eyes.
Poor schlatt. His puppies died :<
Wouldint really say " Survived "
For the boss you want to defeat if you tower to the top floor the boss will use a special availing and jump and go thousands of blocks away

For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16 <3
lie its definetly not the hardest mod
1:21 “Am I having a heart attack?”   This did not age well
Is that a jojo reference
Jojo poses menacingly*
I haven't laughed so hard in a while thank you tommy
this mod have dragons fire and ice
8:40  17:52  18:33 19:09
Bro Charlie told him at the start about pressure plates and then he killed him, fuckworld, and the other one........... quite ironic
Giorno’s theme at the start, nice choice
Giorno theme nice
hello tommy
hat song did you use for the intro
Charlie still has ptsd from his first time in RLcraft
honestly rlcraft looks fun. scary and intense as fuck, but fun-
Why are you only beating the weakest boss and not the titan dragon
25:27 whole new meaning of fall damage.
The destiny 2 music when they were mourning fuckworld was just perfect
i luaghed so hard
crying over fuck world's untimely death
Rip fworld
is the intro giornos theme
wow 9 million to 11 million. Is this some kind of record-
this is a combo of Hexxit and RL craft... fuck my life bzosjkdkelwxnjsjdj no
I play RLcraft and just seeing them screw up everything this just the funniest thing ever
Menacing jojoinnit
17:56 was funniest rap i ever heard🤣🤣🤣😂
No one talking about tommy's beatboxing skills
Shlatt praying
17:09 I love how he just said "the other one"
28:10 JONALD
This video has the legit COOLEST intro ever!
The way Jschaltt looked at Pope Francis broke me
The giorno theme at the start
I love how jschlatt was legitimately upset when fuck world dies.
Charlie popin off man🥰🥰🥰
This is the best video I have ever seen, BUT ACTUALLY IM NOT LYING.
*nobody tell them about the dragons, they struggled this hard on a BATTLE TOWER…*
the whitest raps ive ever heard
Fuckworld had the best character development in the whole video. They had a straight up mental breakdown when he died and tbh i did too
If shlatt ever says he ate soup the fans _will_ cry
i think you should do a 100 day video in RL craft with Wilbur, Charlie and Philza  that would be hilarous!
This is cool, I would love to see more!
Guys I fell through the floor
Schlatt: how did u fall  Tommy: I literally just jumped out the window  That was my favorite part
Can we admire the fact that someone had to caption Charlie at 6:19
3 people brute forcing a battle tower is a sight to be seen
4:40  whoa its coming down (DIES)
Fun fact:if he respawnd the other dog woud not die
"Survived"
Why does the boss look like an among us character
Shut your past chicken bone google chrome no home disowned icecream cone garden nome metranome de demonise final chrome student loan Indians Jones but up
WHAT IS THE STARTING SONG
The hardest mode to beat is adventure
Anyone recognize the destiny 2 song journey? Or is that just me?
They gotta do this shit again
its enough its NOT A MOD ITS MODPACK thx
It was completely schlatts fault that the dogs died because if he respawned the dogs would of teleported
for so long i did not understand why the song intro was so familiar, jojo's theme can go with anything
Why was fuckworlds death the most emotional moment in any video, movie, or book in history.
Just use a fishing rod to kill the beast you want to kill.
RLCRAFT
slime- i say in remembrance of fuckworld we drop some bars right now. shlatt- proceeds to do ph intro
The pressure plate that schlatt dismissed in the beginning ended up killing him 😔
whats the song at the start called
Literally Charlie being our life teacher: BOARED UP THE WINDOWS WHEN WE CAN SEE THEM THEY CAN SEE US/btw Jschlatt really had to sacrifice his cat? If I were him I would sacrifice my books ;-; not my cat ;-;  Btw rip f——world  and the other one you will be missed :(
18:31
IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE
Ngl before this video I forgot that Schlatt had a cutout of Pope Francis
what is the name of the mode ?
Guys don't die keep safe
R.I.P FUCKWORLD 2021-2021  R.I.P THE OTHER ONE 2021-2021

4:30 Charlie : « This is my posture. » Gamers can relate
r.i.p f*ckworld
But when?
I can’t believe tommyinnt stole Slimesicles AND Slmccl intro.
tommy in mods :im better than dream    tommy in rl craft with schlatt and slimecicle:this game is so stressfull
hes thinking about some fucked up shit *nuzzles cat*
DeAtH
I just keep coming back for the intro, that "we did not" followed right after by jojo music is top tier
F for fuck world lets give 1 final salute for him and the other one
6:50 WTF
When Jshlay lost his dog's, and irl started kissing his cat, it made me cry TnT. How heartbreaking it is to actually loose an animal. Love your pets right before they, or you, leave forever. ♡
btw this editor is skilllled
this wass EPPICC!!!!! YOU GO TOMMY
rip fuckworld
19:27 wait... That was actually pretty good Tommy :0
the JoJo music tho
Ya
tommy:thanks for 9 mill  me:watching this at 11 mill...
i got a dog right after i watched this and i instently named it fuckworld
nice jojo reference
Anyone remember when he played this with boffy?
love the intro song
anyone else recognise the intro clue: jojo du ud du du du du du du golden wind
10:14 lmao
HOBOW I’m Just Have You I’m Not Get I Need Be And And I’m Not Have I Love Go I Don’t Lol Ty You Forget I Have It You Lol Ty You Forget I Have It My And And And I Have It And And I Was You Forget I Have It Lol
21:50 The Mumbo Jumbo British rubbed off on Tommy
I like Mandela effected myself with this video… I could have sworn Wilbur was in this video, I was almost certain he was in this video… but no Wilbur in sight
rip f world youtube would delete my comment if i said it
I cried while fuckworld died. I actually cried.
I don’t think he caught him
If they knew about the summoning staff...
7:49 bro that scared me HAHAHAHA
F in the chat for Fuckworld dude 😭
What's the mod name?
Im Not Here For The Video I Am Here For Giorno's Theme.
Can we take a minute to appreciate how genuinely good Tommy is at beatboxing?
God loves you
no bc the fact tommy thought of that in the spot and it was actually good was rlly impressive 0-0
#RIP FUCKWORLD
Homie just uses journey by the Kronos quartet from destiny 2 for the video
too easyy
lux jengus
Congratulations on 11.3 mil subs
Please try and rap the following:  My name is DuckyGoYEEET and I'm here to say there was this wolf named Fuck World and he died in May. Everyone was sad and Schlatt almost cried but they built him a grave and said their final goodbyes.
The zombie in this video is stronger than ender dragon
like for the intro music
7:47 this made me laugh so hard
You guys should try Fundy's plug in :>
>:o
No one: Remix of Ginoro’s theme playing at the beginning powering my levels by 90%:
690K LIKES MILESTONE! 69 spam!
7:37 best moment of the video
6:20 the best part :)
I love your channel, my inspiration!
Just realizing this but using red war music for dog death was a good idea
Am I the only one who paused to read the death messages?
Jshlatt said the pressure plate is for the door and charlie said dont ever assume that  LATER IN THE VIDEO   Jshlatt falls in pressure plate trap
ƈօօʟ ֆȶʋʄʄ
Oh tommy, compared to another modpack rlcraft seems safe and not death 100000 times over
38000th coment
I like how jshlatt screamed so hard at mob 7:49
Nice job if doing this video tommy
I bursted out luahfing at  tommy saying i dont have enouhf skill to eat this bread 🤣🥖🥐🍞
Forge labs: *laughs in superiority*
How to loose all of your 3 cannon lives
schlatt: *kills roc* me: YOU IDIOT
R,I,P The other one HAHAHAHAHA
like for fuck world
Rip fuckworld he was to
“He’s thinkin bout some fucked up shit” Shlatt: * cuddling his cat *
‘Aw i got some crack! .. Krake’
jojo reférence
Charlie is a mess😂
Part 2 please
The way Jschlatt says "TOMMY!" at 24:38 and 30:55 he genuinely sounds worried*'  Its way to wholesome for me✨
“survived”
Tommy has become 100% more manly since he started using jojo music
You guys heard the new fuck world song: growl? It goes like GRGRGRGRRRRRRRRRRRLKNSLBBJHBSBBGAHAHAHAGAAGGAAGGAAHAAHHAHAHAHARFARAFAFARAFAFAGFRRRRRR
Fuckworld’s death scene was the funniest thing ever lol
anyone know the name of the intro song
im rewatching i am impressed he put a JOJO REFRENCE WHICH IS GIORNOS THEME
Ay yo sing 2002
When you realise fuckworld could have been saved if schlatt had res pawned right away
Yes..Giorno theme..also good video-
One of the saddest moments since I’ve been watching Tommyinnit is definitely fuck world dying RIP FUCK WORLD
17:57 😂💀
giorno's theme just makes this better lmao
Your can’t put Jojo in the beginning and not like anime
7:49
Im sorry.. WHY DID HE JUST GET SMITED BY GOD???
0:46 First thing's first  (Believer_ Imagine Dragon)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
OH IS RLCRAFT :}}
love tommy like comment 👇👇
Can you do a thousand
WHY FUCK WORLD HE WAS ALWAYS MY FAVROITE *CRIES*
i think i speak for anyone who has played rl craft alot when you watch this its to funny cause they arent using like rapiers or using like nay baubles or anything its to funny and they never got the top best loot in the tower lmfo i cant to good im happy i watched this lol now i want dream to do this in a manhunt i think that would legit make me cry laughing
GIORNO THEME IS EPIC

I love how traumatized Slimecicle sounds during this entire video.
Shlatt could have saved his dogs if he just respawned: that would have changed his location and the dogs wouldn't have jumped in the lava.
1:27 Jschlatt: am I having a heart attack!? Me: *Extreme flashbacks intensifies*
What music was that in the beginning???

„Survived“ hmm it’s such a strong word…

Alright but now do orespawn- bring back my childhood
7:48
It's giornos theme in the background for me
*Background jojo music*
I still don't understand why they censor the bad words in the beginning and then keep them as they are throughout the entire video. Editor Larry???!!!!!!
16:59  WHY I CAN`T STOP LUGHING ON THIS SCENE WHERE HE SAY ,, AHHHH HUH HUUU FUCKWORLD``
slime the survivor

Tommy’s intro:JJBA reference
Hiii
Jahlatt is being so un American in this video
*:)*
fuckworld man
What if Tommy made a rlcraft smp
Hey Tommy talk to me in private plz
Jshlatt is probably still grieving over fuckworld and the other wolfs death
Tommy:we did it Me: with only about 100000 deaths
HES A JOJOS FAN, LISTEN TTO THE  MUSIC AT THE START
Tommy: Why's there a pressure plate? Schlatt: For the door dumbass. Charlie: Never make that assumption again.  *Later on* Schlatt's Dogs: Both die because Schlatt made the same assumption and stood on a pressure plate that activated a trap door
When you don’t have enough skill to eat your bread: 😔
why does he keep using Giorno Giovanna's theme?!?
That was so cool :D
i like how tommy puts jojo theme music at the very beginning
MAKE IT AN SMP PLEASE
I just realized he made it too 11 million

8:56 if you know you know

RIP fuckworld
there's a lot of people that plays RL craft
the jojo themes in the beginning
LA mod
"Am i having a heart attack!?"  -Jschlatt   (who actually had a heart attack.)      (1:26)
one of those moments when some one dies and you drop the beat  (every one looks at you ) you: its what **ck world wanted
the fact that il vento d'oro played in the intro is cool❤️
The Jojo music 🤣🤣🤣
You guys know that there is a glitch that if you pillar up to the side to the top and then you hook it alot with thenfishing rod and then fight it it blow away
me: wtf waht is the guy screaming for?   Guys: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
It’s not a glitch to unsubscribe it’s just ppl unsub

600k holy shit
Girl 1: I can’t believe he didn’t cry during titanic Girl 2: do men even have feelings?  *boys: **17:35*
I love this so much slimecicle is by far my favourite person in this.

5:47

The impossible fiction respectively deceive because macaroni postprandially heat out a aberrant vermicelli. sedate, third bestseller
F***world F***ed his last F***
schlatt before: the pressure plate is for the door dumb*ss      *schlatt  dies beacuase of pressure plates and starts crying*
IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE
am i the only one that minded bout the giorno theme?
ITS A CHUPACABRA haha
RLcraft
6:19 Translation: Oh my God! Shclatt just got struck by lightning! And I think I pissed my pants!
I forgot that Charlie played this before lol! He’s just so traumatized lol
i wouldn't say you survived...
7:06
Just wait until they learn how too cheese battle towers

Yes every one just casually ignored the Jojo music
Its not the worlds hardest mod, it is the worlds hardest modpack.

Shlatt: tries to sacrifice cat Cat: yo bro wtf

Anyone gonna talk abt this part 17:52 - 18:10
I think I just had a stroke from laughing at the sound of schlatts panicked scream
Tommy:mans got a shank  schlatt:thats an s their weapon in the chaos
I Like how in the starting of the video he’s playing Joe Joe’s music
I love when he fell threw the floor lmao

Hmm jojo with trap?
You could just respond and f***world won't die
Jojo?
“Wait, wait, there’s a pressure plate… Why- Why is there a pressure plate? 🤨” “It’s for the door, dumbass.”
18:14 - 18:17 was the cutest most wholesome scene of jschlatt i have ever seen.
WHO STILL REMEMBERS THE GIORNO THEME JAY D REMIX THAT TOMMY USED
thats a realistic mod

What mod is that?
I love how the moment jschlatt pulled out an iron axe, the soviet anthem just started playing
Hello tommyInnit

When I really need to poo, I just play this video because Jesus might take it down
this group should play terraria
bruh I just realised this they're using Giorno's theme at the start 00:26
Didn't you play this with Boffy like a year and a half ago
Why is it the first of Tommy’s videos I watch, it’s this type of chaos. Lovin it
I remember when doing an rlcraft stream I couldn't even step out of the house I had found since if I did I would be instantly killed🤣
You have to make a up side down T to make a long sword 😅😅😅
No one count the number of deaths in this video
The question is not how good the weapon or item is.            It’s: Is Schlatt smart enough to use it
Is no one gonna talk about JJBA playing at the beginning!! Love it!
Ay yo is that intro from slimecicle's rlcraft video?
.
"What happened when the goose God died" mr.goose said so I said "knife"
I liked giorno's theme in the intro :)
What’s the music at the beginning name?
when fuckworld died, i screamed “NOOOO FUCKWORLD”
Is that a JoJo reference
Charlie's best quotes of the video: AH! AH! OH! DA-shou-theAA-wojcicki-gojua-sauki-ragra-gointobed AHHH IT'S A CREE-CREE-A CREEP-CRE-CREEPER OF TRU-TRUASDFL-CHA-FU-FU-FUCKING SHITTING!
This is a movie its almost an hour long keep up good work brotha
23:18 =  Slimecicla was slain by Gnekk Jschlatt: u were by gneh-......geck- tommy: GA NECk me: WHAT IS THAT NAME. what the flip
Cono giorno giovanna
I’ve always wondered how a human being could want to kill another human. Then Fuckworld died and I was like “oh, okay”
Who thought the intro music was epic
He said that was the hardest map And my brain went somewhere else
6:38 lmaoo

Me: there is no way they beat this challenge on one life
Tommy: our goal is to beat the dungeon boss and SURVIVE
music is fire
If you use a fishing rod on the dungeon boss there’s a glitch that flings him away then you can grab all the loot ;>
I was watching this and got in a car crash. funny vid tho lols
The fact that both fuckworld and the other one wouldn't have died if Schlatt respawned faster
THE JOJO MUSIC AT THE START JUST *CHEFS KISS*
NOOOO FUCKWORLD :(
was that jojo music i heard?
Schlatt: its simple Also Schlatt: AHHHHHHHHHHH
THE FACT THAT SCHALTT STARTED PRAYING HJDVHBSHBC
WHY IS GIORNOS  THEME PLAYING IN THE BEGGINING?? LMAO
i was like *hmm why do i feel deja vu* and i remember, he did this like a year or two ago with boffy!
F

14:45 is the start of a compilation of tommyinnit being dropped from his parents

Does anyone know the music they used at the start of the video?
Anyone vibe to the c round music!
calvin survived RLcraft for 200 days and defeated the dungeon boss like 5 days in… THATS BORING
I likes when tommyinnit charlie slimecicle and jchlatt  do pvp with the boss
I loved Charlie face at the end
as a pro this is hilarious
Jshlatt: “am I having a heart attack”  Everybody else in existence: “I’ve seen this before”  Edit: OMG THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE LIKES THIS IS MY MOST POPULAR COMMENT EVER (happy noises intensify)
The music at the start... Is that a Jojos reference?!?!
Part 2

Can’t believe the pressure plates came back to haunt Schlatt
I play this mod as my daily hobby
He's never played crazy craft has he?
kaguya

His name was fuck world now he is dead I don’t have enough skill to give you some head

When charlie died, why did it say 'Blame Lag'???
29:55 The boys when the completed the Cayo Perico Heist
Remember what schlatt said I'm just saying
Oh, so that's what kristians do
This is so funny, i can't stop laughing😆😆😆
the funny thing is that tommy just searched anime music and put it for his intro
a noob: Rlcraft most hardest m0D me:ok and Noob : it hard Hav u Nat Play it befar   Me who clearly did not play the hardest mod: 😐🖥 idk what nooB 😂😂 Noob:😠  Btw I did not play it 😢

Jojo theme fits on everything
Is it strange that the time slimecicle played rlcraft winter is my comfort stream?

You can actually loot the top of the tower with just a lot of blocks and a fishing rod
I love how Charlie warned them that think process of thinking every pressure plate will get u killed and then it actually happens
i got some crack krake meat
I like the jojo music in the start
JOJO
Rip fuckworld We will miss you
Fun fact every tomyinnit vid I’ve watched has had giornos theam as the intro
Hey tommy do re remember when you were “Aneematyted”
The boss: Amug Us

Hi Tommy I was here since hacked client videos love your videos
When jotaros theme starts playing
6:17

Rip fworld o7
This is ez compared to playing it on Bedrock like Bedrockers
Why does schlatt have a cardboard cutout of the Pope-
Is this an eminem verse? 18:34
14:11 I love how Schlatt is so proud of himself when he fell through the floor.   Tommy: I'm sorry to say this but we have bigger problems that that. WHERE ARE YOU?  Schlatt: I Fell through the floor :D   Tommy: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
me, a veteran rl player: ah yes, of course, face the battle tower head first, that'll go marvelously- aaaaand there they go, alright
"Man's got a shank." yes  "Hey Schlatt," "Yeah" "I've got a knife." "wow!" "That's an s-tier weapon in the united kingdom." yesyesyes
I like your taste in intro music.
I DONT HAVE ENOUGH SKILL TO EAT THIS BREAD, I DIED.

Damn tommy is really good at freestyle rap
Rip fuckworld

F for fuckworld and the other one
16:08 trumpet skeleton [???] 16:26 rip forkworld (and the other one) 17:49 forkworld memorial [kinda] 19:49 bart. 20:23 *ominous music plays* 25:59 tnt 26:24 ring, 26:34 mega-slender 29:24 realization... 30:09 tommy says "screw this"
0:12 Ayyy *Giorno's Theme*

Jojo
the intro was actually really good
16:39 That was very sad :(
Rip fuck world
Charlie: - But I'm pretty sure god was affronted by something we said - Schlatt: *slowly turns to Pope *
This is berry funny R.I.P fuck world
jojo music had me bopin
what is the intro tune called if you know can i pls know? :)
bonc
You should make this world a series and finish the game in honor of fuckworld and I would love to see a hardcore series from u
I like the jojo music
I think this is the best intro and maybe the video on my opinion also the intro is 🔥🔥
6:18 my god he got struck by gods pp
Tommyinnit: my-   Jschlatt: I’m leaving   Me: LAUGHS HARDY   This part was funny
Tommyinnit: adds giorno music in intro    Me: oooooooo giorno music
Is Tommy a jojo fan
3:24 bruh you killed a roc you could had gave it food and it would had let you fly
Pause on 0:11 and see Tommy’s face. Bruhhhh
Cuphead music starts at 15:32
Phil would love this
I love how Slimecicle sounds worried the whole way through
Tommyinnit im a 9 year Old and i have 1 lady, you most likely have more ladies than me
pt 2?
Giorno's theme should be Tommy's new intro for any and only any "This was the craziest..." or "This was 999% funnier" coming from a weeb
JoJo
KSI vs Tommy in Dumgeon??
*dude why is the dog skilled enough to wear clothes but i am not*  -Slimecicle
"his name was fuckworld and he is dead, I dont have enough skill to eat this bread" pretty fire not gonna lie
So fucking tommyinnit is fucking giorno innit
FUUUCKWORLD
6:52 *the Vatican state wants a sacrifice*
Sub to boffy
I think I know why they call it rlcraft cause it's way more realistic
I like how tommy became the philza at the end
I hope tommyinnit does another video about rlcraft
18:31 the subtitles make it all so much better
RIP fworld
no one is talking about the intro music
Tommy forgot the time he played RLCraft with Boffy
Pls do a part two but with dream and techno blade
fuckworld are you ok
poor schlatt just looks so unerved XD
Boffy..
btw, to all non-catholics/christians, schlatt said the Our Father/Lords Prayer when he was praying to the Pope
Oh I love RLCraft, you should play this more!
ME hears jojo theme MY mind A shlt here we go again
Wait i used to have this mod Lol- It was hella hard. I almost never used it though XD-
Who's Been A True Fan Of Tommy For A Long Time"🔥"
he said he survived in the title     umm.. im not telling him
Not gonna lie I actully thought that tommyinnit was annoying but I kept watching his videos an I don't think he is annoying anymore 😂
20:59 why did Ace Attorney music randomly start-
me watching this when your at 10.7M rn
The victorious gorilla historically copy because russian adventitiously tire failing a guarded acoustic. absorbed, trashy syria
By the use of a hat in time music in 6:07 and 9:35 Plus other times in other videos(and maybe even later in this video,idk i didnt watch to the end) I think that we can say either tommy ir editor larry apriciate A hat in time
This was great
tommy's singing is acctually pretty good
Oh no
Jshlatt: My left arm is damaged- am I having a heart attack 😟⁉️ Dream SMP Shlatt:
6:32 Jshlatt
Tommy:today we have one goal to defeat the boss, and *SURVIVE*
Worst things happen to this earth number 1 fuck world dyeing
Why does the dungeon boss look a bit..... *SUS* ?
I would love a crossover between tommy and the boys (josh,mully,juicy,eddievr,and smashing)
You know it's a funny ass video when the intro is the gornio theme
FUCK WORLD
rip fuckworld.
The music at the start is lit
1:24 schlatt: am i having a heart attack... forshadowing?
Haven't you done this mod with Boffy before
I was actually crying about fuckworld then they start dropping bars
i have made harder mods than this and know as a fact that its true cus i have played this mod be for
Why is it called " real life craft " when there are frickin dragons
I know that the end the series rlcraft
🤣🤣🤣
I have no soul i laughed when his dogs tried to swim in the lava XD (im disappointed in me to)
I can't believe u play RLcraft
Normally I'd be crying but my fvcked up brain at 3am laughed at the death of fck boy and the other one
R.I.P wiggly/wumble butt
0:04 you have taste in sound i see
Tommy: TODAY WE HAVE ONLY ONE GOAL! TO DEFEAT THE DUNGEON BOSS AND SURVIVE! Me: But that’s 2-
Wait a minute i didn't remember this???
20:57 best moment
Please do RLCraft again
" this is my posture ".
F### world 2
Sad that fuck world died before his new album
My favorite pet in this video was bumbleOOHHH
him playing jojo pose in the backround
RLCRAFT
Try to kill a level 5 ice dragon
*subscribes*
Amazing video
Noooo rip
This gives me popularmmos flashbacks
the drip wolf
6:11 Tommy you have good taste in background music
I was expecting dragons in the sky burning everything and golems chasing them This isn’t as close as how crazy they are
Terraria: i am the most complicated game survival game ever RLcraft: bonjour
You know it's going to be a good video when Giorno's Theme is in the intro
You didn’t survive don’t lie 😂
f in chat for fuckworld
Rip f*ckworld :(
The intro and title is more like a slimecicle video
26:44

RIP FUCKWORLD RIP THR ANOTHER ONE :( POOT HER/HIM ONWER
I was laughing the entire time XD
*inhales*   IS THAT A JOJO REFRENSE?!
Jojo song
That’s uh some nice music in the intro
i love how charlie just dies and he smiles at camera like "i died :)"
B O R N T O D I E
Tommy straight up ripped off Charlie’s intro from his RL craft videos I see him. Man used a techno remix of Il Vento Doro I see him. He ain’t slick
Make another vid of this and make a link for this mod
Im sorry that tommy has corona
🌝🌚
Tommy you know tubbo make Philza song I well sub it all
Make a series like the smp
DO IT AGIN
we really need quakity to play this-
Tommy:Schlatt where are you? Schlatt: i fell through the floor :D
Ay
Aay
The  hardest mod is 1000+ mods
I just died of heart attack when I saw the Pope behind jschlatt, oh my fucking god.
Tommy ran out of the window, and then he realized he ran out of the window 😞😕
11:42 that's kinda gay 😂
11:10 that's what she said 😶😆🤭
1:25 *dream smp flashbacks 😶😆🤭🤭*
noooooo not fuckworld
Just rod or bow the boss from afar
I love you Tommy
3:54 Tommy:,,Germany any Flint-Shards?" I Love you beeing British xD
rlcraft do be not so hard as most people think. (people speedrun it lol)
thts actually i first found him annoying and next day the subscription included tommyinnit tommyvods
2:06 Charlie says "Hey Schlatt Never Make That Assumption Again"  Then Schlatt 16:24 "Dies to a pressure plate trap"
Tommy: "Hey there beautifu-" Smile fades so fast. "...you don't have a face."  That was my favourite highlight so far.
I think they should made this a movie
Bruh Im Hearing Jojo's Theme
Rip fuck world and the other dog
Rip fuck world
I love the fucking jojo music dude
When they r like fighting in the tower They sound like it was mcc like "I go for spider" "i go for skeleton" I GOT IT" "AHHHHH" " FUUUUCKKKK" "HOLY SHIT DUDE"
Make more tommy!!!
rlcraft
The amount of high-pitched screaming that happened…
MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ok but these three would cause so much chaos irl, I'd like a vlog one day Mr. Innit
Charlie definitely had the idea to put Giorno's theme in the intro.
so the title was a lie
RLCraft is so fuckin scary
"we're not safe anywhere" yep that describes rlcraft
Ok but like I watched this at 1 am DYING from laughter and I had to be quiet 😩
One word, Boffy
Me a rlcraft player who got the dragon armour and tools and defeated the game watching this video remembering the time i was the same as them
I giorno giovanna respect the jojo reference
i ngot a geko
schlatt:theres damage in my left arm..  also schlatt: AM I HAVING A HEART ATTACK!???
"i survived minecrafts hardest mod..." also tommy: *dies more than 30 times during the video*
slimecicle, the rlcraft veteran
DO IT AGAIN!
On slytheminer it not hard for him ahhahaha
I need a link for the mod
Mode nightmare is impossible
Tommy is actually very good at rapping :0
😂😂😂😂😂👍goood!!
jojo intro
30 minutes of screaming wow
Rip f**kworld
I just imagine grace overhearing charlie during these recordings  just from the other room "in remembrance of fuckworld.."
o7 fuckworld
I did enjoy it, but battletower ... they're like the easiest dungeon, so if you manage to do a rogue like dungeon or beat the ender dragon, I'd say that was a RLcraft challenge, try without enchant if you want ;P
9:26  (personal timestamp)
Forge labs: pathetic
They are....    HIGH
Damn 18:32 Just me or does that sound so good.
RIP fuckworld 2021 may 23
Charlie:rl craft is intense Forge labs:Hold my beer
dude if he didnt sit there and cry his wolves would be still alive
They should make a series on this it’s really good
rlcraft + jojo = absolute pog^100
bart looks like a fucking man o war. that shit will kill you and its basically a colony of bacteria living together somehow.
This is the most chaotic video i have ever watched and i love it
WHOEVER HATE TOMMYINNIT THEY ARE TRASH
17:28 would be a good meme for "men don't have feelings"
"Rest in rice" - A note when Tommy died
Rip, Fuckworld  An experienced rapper  And a great doggo
Im dying at the name Fuckworld
"Am I having a heart attack?" Lmfao
Fuck world and...the other I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING
You guys have beat the freaking battletower boss for FUCKWORLD!
Jschlatt:doing a sacrifice on his cute cat Cat:bro wtf

TIMMYAINTIT
FUCKWORLD
R.I.P THAT FUCKWORLD AYYYYY
NOOOO! TOMMY! HOW DARE YOU BEAT TECHNOBLADE TO 10 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS!!! 😫😫😫😫
WAS THAT JOJO MUSIC AT THE START
Did no one hear tommy say I have crack
All 3 of his Jojo fans are freaking out
Good choice of music on the start
14:45 am i high or was that  effect called "Penetration 2" lmao?
Not the dooooooooogggggggggsssssssdddd
''Am I having a heart attack?''  That didn't age well.
Imagine if Tubbo was in this-
My favorite thing about Tommy is that he has a little girl scream it makes his videos funnier 😂😂
*music plays* me: YO IS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING JOJO REFRENCE??!!
Rl craft is a mod pack, not a mod
do it again>:)
fuckworld
10:58 did schlatt just do the lesbian growl???
4:35 i wont talk. xD
Jojo's!
today we only had one goal! And that was to defeat the dungeon boss! And too survive.   THAT WASNT ONE GOAL MOTHERF-
Imagine this mod with the hardcore mod it would be impossible lol
tommyinnit when something is hard : **plays Jojo's Bizzare adventure music**
And I thought the terramorph mod was hard, damn
0:10 GIORNOS THEME GIORNOS THEME GIORNOS THEME AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH MUDA MDUA MUDA MUDA wtf is wrong with me
Schlatt: *gets struck by lightning* *also schlatt turns around*
"Survived" you mean died about 30 times?
9:14 *Flashbacks to when he played RLCraft with Boffy*
*can it rap?*
He survived kinda innit
If schlatt respawned the dogs would’ve survived
Ive been here since tommy was young asf
7:00 NOOO SOUPPPP
I like how the editor bleeped out the first few swears but gave up after like 3 minutes
I felt that pain
Is this RLCraft
I eat babies
Go To Time 13:30 and watch Schlats reaction LOL
TOMMY USED JOJO MUSIC >:DDDDDD
“Thanks for 9 million”  *he now has 10mil and a whole entire office*
the final boss be looking kinda sus tho
that giorno theme tho
30:37
30:39
Is that a jojo reference?...
Me at the beginning of the video - is that a jojo reference?
🕊R.I.P FuckWorld🐺 🕊R.I.P The Other One🐺
13:00 DEM BARS
24:26 BAHAHAHAA NOT JCSLATT PREYING
Alternate title tommy plays dungeons and dragons
I remember watching this REALLY out of it & I had no idea what was going on
Fuck world more like ZA WARUDO
The Demogorgon was weird
I saw herobrine and skipped 10 secs.
pls play more rlcraft and you can find that tower anywhere the boss at the top is incredibly weak compared to other bosses
11:30 big men little joy
I love the trauma in his voice. You can tell that he's just been through some s***
7:45 that’s it, just that
RIP FUCKWORLD
This video was intense
The music at the beginning was POGCHAMP
They should start an smp with this mod
When Tommy means “ I survived “ he means he gave up after dying 100 times
Rip FUCK WORLD
Schlatt turning around and preying to the pope after being struck by the lightning- this man is a legend.
Rlcraft
JOJO!!!
Jshlatt didnt listen to slimecicle...
5:46 This part aged well because tommy got a pet spider called shroud in the dream smp
first big prison then big house and big boat🤣
20:57 I was drinking water at the time.. And when that part came on, I DONT KN9W HOW BUT WHEN I LAUGHED, THE WATER CAME OUT OF MEH NOSE!
4:13
Dude when schlatt went through the floor and was talking to slime he was like a child say I'm in the wall
It's Either one your going to bed or AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
“hes thinking about some fvcked up sh1t”  schlatt: *hugging a cat*
part dos pls
WHOA its coming down 😂😂😂
*sees trumpet skeleton*  Mr. Bones is that you?
*Flashbacks to Boffy playing RLcraft*
DO A RL CRAFT series
I think now thet you like JoJo and berserk. Good video tho
this is RL craft and it is insanly hard but fun once you get the use to it and it makes grate fun
Tommy, can we be Friends?
Ok but Tommy and Charlie’s rapping is genuinely so good
I watched charlie play irl craft  it was funny
i never thought tommy would use giorno's theme in a video
this whole video is pure chaos
GO FIGHT A DRAGON DUDE :)))))
O know that that is Rlcraft
why is no one talking about the bars charlie is laying down bro its legit fire. dont be shy post the full version Charlie
HOW  DOES TOMMY GET SUBS SO FAST
rlcraft is hell but i play it all the time
With the opening I was considering to see slimecicle, condi and grizzly and I was partly right
I don’t like schlatt why do videos with him
What??? i
whats the song in the background at  0:13.?
I love the jojo theme
Cool_cat
who else got creeped out bc of jshlatt
*Funny*
Slime y like how his smile is of pain it was soo funnu
i just want to know what was written in the book
Is it me or is he really getting less annoying the more you watch him
this was my bday present video
I still love the fact that Tommy litteraly censors swear words for only like about 1-2 minutes
i like how tommy played this with boffy a few years back and it still feels completely new to him lmao
“WOAAHHHH, Thats a nice chest.”  -Tom Simons 25:57 mummy milkers size?
Tommy: he is probably thinking about something sh*t schlatt: crys while hugging cat
I think this is the best team work they've ever done
Chơi rlcrarf
FUCKWORLD
Lovin the jojo reference at the beginning ;w;
I wouldn’t really call this….   Surviving..
1:33 man's got a shank. 😂😂 I'm from the hood and yes... It is as easy as getting a stick and a rock to make a weapon. Approved 👍😂😂😂
THE INTRO WAS EVERYTHING
6:17
17:00 destiny 2 very first mission after you lose the destiny 1 tower  Btw I love destiny 1 & 2
hi tommy
Doa 😭😭😭😭😭
"Fuck shit fuck shit goddamn it" -charlie 2021
Tommyinnit your not annoying  you made me laugh😂😂
I LIKE HOW SCHLATT IS PRAYING AND  SACRIFICING HIS CAT XD
What is the iintro music
i think he forgot when he played this with boffy :(
My recommended: *just tommyinnit videos* Me: *K guess ima stop watching ranboo and watch Tommy*
Jschlatt got hitted by a lightning:(charlie:started speaking infernal language)(jschlatt:started looking at a saint and f*cking sacrifices his cat)
🕴
9:06  “Home is a crater-“         *Intense flashbacks*
Please put link to mod in the description
I really won't a part 2 to were guys just be absolute chads
RL craft hardcore to make it harder
If you didn't cry when fuckworld died then I don't trust you-
Fuck world almost actually made me cry wtf man
Next time you name a bucket name it burningpee
finally some jojo  reference
"I remember this from hexxit from 2012" I love how schlatt sums my thoughts from watching this video
*schlatt just sitting there minding his buisness in home after a nice where he almost died and did die over 100+ times* *weird monster thing comes from the roof*  AHHHHHHHH-
A MOMENT OF SILINES FOR FUCK WORLD
1:25 shlatt when hes sees the l'manberg script
moooorrreeee vidddddddsssss
“His name was fuckworld now he’s dead” Schlatt:**cries**
RLCraft scares me. But I'll be the first to admit that I am a coward. ....Correction: My fear is WELL founded for RLCraft.
no u didnt ! >:(  sus lies *deception*
Am i the only one who heard the destiny soundtrack at 17:25
Schlatt says the pressure plate was just for the door but later lost fuckworld for not caring about pressure plates 😞
that leader dude looks like an impasta
Huh that’s fun but chance cube survival is harder
I can’t even watch the video because I keep re-watching the intro ‘cause it’s literally amazing.
Rip Fuck world😞
God forgive me for laughing at schlatt saying am I having a heart attack 😭
All of that. For one tower
I love how schlatt's cat is like *bro wtf?*
how I will refer to my sexuality from now on: "women enjoyer"
I didn't notice this but, if you focus on hearing  Slimecicle rap he kind of sounds like enemin.
Tommyinnit: I Survived Minecraft's Hardest Mod... Me: No he didn't Video: Your right
PLEASE DO 100 Days!
I liked the video but the part I hated when the dog died
Schlatt : am I Having a heart attack  Me : pls do I would love that
I heard you got covid. may god help you recover
Imagine meeting someone named Fuckworld. "Hello, Mister uh, world?" "Please. Call me Fuck."
Slimecicle warned jschlatt to not trust pressure plates and it was pressure plates that killed him and his dogs
Hope you’ll play with Boffy again someday
IT A FUCKING MODPACK
Do 100 days please
bruh you watch jojo (the music at the beginning 0:00)
Ah see you are a cultured man as well as you used I'l vento doro for the opening
I just want to tell you that if Jschlatt just clicked respawn right after he died from the trap, the dog's would have teleported to him at his spawn. so this means that jschlatt could have saved Fworld.... R.I.P Fworld
rlly BT boss dude u can kill him with just fishingrod
I have never laughed so hard
Title is misleading    He did not survive
It's called rl craft
everyone: "wow!" people who watch Forge Labs: " *Pathetic* "
Hear schlatt scream is the funniest shut ever
"Hes thinking about some fucked up shit" *cuddling with jambo*
R.I.P. Fuckworld       2021-2021 You will be remembered by all, and stay within our hearts, may your soul rest in peace 😔
do it again pls
then cxlvxn be like:this is ez
Day one of harvesting goes to get tommy to reply to me
I think instead of shlatt saying I got dogs he should have said I got bitches
Why was there Giorno Giovanna's theme in the intro
I knew I recognized that Destiny 2 sad theme from somewhere
https://youtu.be/EA9GnGwYTJg The song at the beginning.
Congrats for making it to 10mil subs!!   LETS TRY GET TO 20MILLL
Why is Tommy not grateful fo the 9 mil and wants more-
K l
what is that music at the start
You guys are not youtuber idots don't tell bad words otherwise I will unsubscribe you
The boss is sus..
Bro, try killing dragons instead
tommy: if we destroy the spawners we can get to the top jschlatt: its easy **It was not easy**
tommy: gets grabbed by big blue monster  top left : penetration 2
OI YOU SHOULD'VE HAD BOFFY IN ON THIS LIKE LAST TIME
the fact Jschlatt said in the begining that the pressure plate was" for the door dumbass" to tommy and then he, fuckworld and the otherone fel in a trap bc a pressure plate
Why is the into jojo  Has this always been there and I'm being stupid?
Fuckworld fought hard and Tommy says fuckworld would have wanted to destroy the tower answer:yes he would have wanted
Why are we ignore the song for today is a DAMNED JOJO REFERENCE
Whats the name of the mod?
6:18  Lyrics:  *gets struck by lightning*  Schlatt: OOH  Charlie: OH OH DA- SUIGVKN- GEOIVMN- ROGOVJDJ-i GAJOUA- RODOCKHG-  Tom simon: Are you ok?  Charlie: NO!
FUCKWORLD NOOO
i like how at the beginning he tries to edit out most of the swearing but charlie ends up swearing so much he just gives up
Me:Im thirsty and hungry mom!!!  Mom: You can't eat or drink you are skilled enough need level 70!
Tommy's second rap actually caught me off guard- it didn't actually suck ass
"The hardest mod" Fundy: hold my 2 videos on that 1: https://youtu.be/5C2wdLLTbTI 2: https://youtu.be/Z5Y8uwpJrhs
7:37  JSCHLATT SCREAM  BOTTOM TEXT
4:19 cuphead music

7:46 MY FAVOURITE MOMENT-
I got to say this now but slimie boy is really good at rapping on the spot like damn

Jojo theme question mark

Why Giornos theme, tommy?
21:48 he just made a sword with a pen!s design lol

People who plays this mod for 100 day: defeats ender dragon last Tommy: our target is dungeon boss
00:26 just vibin

Tommy pls give me the link to the mod :○
I’d love to see another RLCraft video, this was extremely funny.
Boffy
I fell through the floor😀
18:04 they played Destiny 2 music
Slimecic got egected from funny mode

....
Me: *watching YT and vibing* My Notifications: *"Bonjour."*
Schlatt: *Gets struck by lightning* Schlatt: There is only one solution, a sacrifice
Tommy are u a jojo fan
The destiny2 music makes it so much sadder :(
Everyone crying over fuckworld: Me: laughing my ass off while they cry
Rip fuckworld 😔
Oh I played RLcraft on technic launcher when I was younger! This is a throwback and a half! Glad that it makes everyone else suffer as much as it made me!
Hhahahaha
Giornos theme
ANYONE AGREE THAT WE SHOULD GET A PART 2!!??
Alternate title: I *didn’t* survive Minecraft’s hardest Mod…
rip fuckworld
I love that beating a battletower golem is like final boss for them when there are insane bosses like asmodeus or amlgalich
Im happy you’re having a great time up there 😂😂
Socksfor1 is really good at this mod, ask him for help or something
22:33
i can'd believe they played a song from Jojo's bizzardo adventure at the intro. I wonder if Tommy innit actually watches the anime :) .
fuck worlds and dog man (world) is such a sad story.h. alright bro le'ts go.
RIP Fuckworld
JOJO
Jojo
Not him playing the cooking mama theme as he eats meats then dies
why he using girornos theme-
THIS WAS PHAKING GOOD HAHAHAHAHHAHHAHHHAHHA!!!
oh no rlcraft :o
video title: "I survived Minecraft's hardest mod"  video: dies an uncountable number of times
“Women enjoyers”  Schlatt: Ok so I do not agree with this statement.  ..And people call him homophobic? ..Ight then-
I don't really know what's going on...
pt 2 please
Apologize Apologise
the character arcs in this are exquisite-  charlie: middle sibling way too invested in a game they’re playing  schlatt: the bored older brother who just wants to take the piss out of everyone and joke around  tommy: the younger brother getting introduced to the game and super excited about but also not too invested
this is literally the funniest trio-
Imagine being an expert at rlcraft who played for weeks upon end, and noticing every single mistake they are making. And just keeping my irritation to myself, because I can't change anything.
"THAT WOULD BE TOO GODDAMN EASY"
man nutting
"Why are there church bells?" Because you need God.
I like how tommy censors the video for like the first quarter.
all i heard was JOJO
Stop say bad words tommyinnit
When will u continue playing this mod again?
Rip fuckworld.
Krew has this mod they have alot of dragon eggs
Lol jojo music
6:21 man had a fucking seizure😂😂😂😂
Tommy: *questions everything* Charlie: *tip man* Schlatt: *attempts to sacrifice soup to god*
Yooo the rl craft is like Forge labs content the medieval one
I love how often they turn to slime cus they don't know wtf is happening
Rip Fuck world
Pretty sure it’s no longer the hardest modpack anymore
Can we get a part 2
Thank you for promoting JoJo
29:54 😂
29:37 😂
"i survived minecrafts hardest mod" im not sure about the survived part
Sipover is sad
Charlie’s face at the end got me dead as hell
We Know He's Ready Gironos Theme
5:21 dude died by null
Is the intro a JoJo's reference?
Rip fuck world and the other one too
16:47
Slimecicle is getting constant PTSD from his own play through
Alternate title: Tommyinnit and his friends invade trump tower
The roomy reason specially spare because tip industrially confess before a measly sousaphone. extra-large extra-small exuberant, ahead digital
Jschlatt = Herobrine confirmed?!?
I really hope for a sequel to this
Tommy are you a jojo fan or do you just play gorino’s theme because you can?
rip fuckworld
rip Fuckworld
17:07 literally my favorite soundtrack from my favorite game
Isn't it funny how charlie said to never underestimate pressure plates again and that's how schlatt and his dogs die
Hardest mod: combine everything. Put so many mods to the point where walking has a skill requirement
who else was vibing to the jojo's bizzare music
wtf I laughed and spilled my Cheerios on my dog 😭 😭 ✋
Rip
anybody else notice that tommy’s rap was basically the same as the peanut bar rap from community?
Tommyinit: i got some crack
Tommy your way too young to do crack
10:13 and so on make me laugh like crazy
charlie slimecicle, as their mentor going into RLCraft, was destined to die for their success, that's why he was stalling for time as the tower blew up
Its rLcraft tommy
Tommy innits a little peice of sh*t
More vids like this please!! :)
Tommy do be turning into elpa with the jojo music and rlcraft
Why do you use Gorino s theme
What an idiot didn’t respawn to keep the other survive
the ads bro!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Eminem has been real silent since Tommy, Jschlatt, and Charlie dropped that mixtape
The creature on 4:30looks like a type of Demogorgan  Ps, not sure I spelled that right lol
Tommy hates anime- yet uses the jojo song at the Start of the video- no hate! I love you Tommy :D
You are so funny you are not anoing

18:25
"hes wriggly and i named him bumblebe- OHHHH" - Tommyinnit 2020
Morremos mas passamos bem
When Charlie came in with a Massive bow, it made me think. If you made the screen black and took out any evidence that it's a bow. what would you get? 11:10
when charlie said to tommy that the creeper would break his legs i spat my fanta everywhere and choked of laughter haha
16:54 this hits hard
There’s so many times they curse, I just imagine if BBH saw this video….😂
Rip Fuck World.
Plot twist: philza joins and gets all the armour and tools and resources  Tommy:DADZA
MAKE A PART TWO MR TOM
I have rewatched this video so many times but I didn't notice the fact the charlie died from a skeleton at the beginning
*amongus*
RIP Fvckworld... He will be missed... (Also the other one)
"I have to offer a sacrifice" OH YOU DID NO-
why is no one talking about how good tommy’s rap is at 19:29
Tommy : proceeds to die multiple times "I survived rl craft"
Cg on 10 million followers!
And I quote  Born to die World is a fuck
Survived is in quotation marks lol
I love how in most of his videos he blocks out the swearing and then just stops randomly 👍😅
This group with this series would be killer.
*Tommy doing the intro* Me: *shuffling to the anime music in the background *
Hay it ark
my manz got 10 mil now
i like it so  so bad editor larry always use jojo theme song and jojo is my fav anime SO ITS FEELS SO GOD DAMN GOOD
Tommy : I JUST GOT PICKED UP BY A BIRD!!  Me : sorry that was my son learning.
Tommy - “WE ONLY HAVE ONE GOAL! TO DEFEAT THE DUNGEON BOSS! AND SURVIVE”        I’m pretty sure that’s two…
The boss looked like amogus
7:48 Schlatt: just chilling     *The fucking grim reaper pays him a visit*
Schlatt: "my left arm is damaged! Am I having a heart attack?"  Me: "not again"
Fuck world
when the dog is more experienced than you.
Charlie:  "Woah its coming down!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *continues to go under the tree*
What song is that one at the start
Hi Tommy if u see dis I am big fan
The intro you use jo jos song I’m impressed 😔
Make the series of this mode pleaaseeee
it is just me or Charlie's sounds like Eminem 18:50
I LOVED THIS VID PLZ DO THIS AGAIN TOMMY
I've been obsessed with young you're videos Lately
Bruh I want a horror series involving that pope cutout
What is the name of the song at the beginning?
I’ve had to resub to this guy about 14 times now     YouTube please STAP
I am watching Tommy to make me feel better right now, id say he is my comfort streamer. My dream is to be a content creator and maybe even collaborate with my favorite Streamers, my sister's don't believe i can make it, and its getting to the point where neither do I. I've been doing Youtube for a few years now, but I'm thinking of making a new channel and starting fresh. Tommy reminds me that I can make it at a young age. To be honest I am tired of being told that I am going no where, and it would make my day if Tommy saw my message, to let him know how amazing he is. If you are reading this Tommy, Thank you. One day in the future I will make it, and maybe we could interact one day. The chances that you will see this are low, but I am saying it anyways. I am so sorry for wasting your time with my message if you read this. Thank you for giving a 13 year old girl, a little hope.  P.s sorry for spamming,  I just really hope you see this.
Soul knight
The pope Francis Is wuit you shlab
best birthday video ever thanks tommy schlatt and Charli! ik it wasn't for me but it was on my birthday!
10 mil subscribers. I expect more rlcraft.
Charlie: i give him 2 seconds God: is that a challenge
Congratulations on making it to 10 Mil, Right Before Miniminter.
I love how Charlie acted as their traumatized guide, to RLcraft, especially considering he has played this before, and understands a bit about the mod pack
17:26 they were playing destiny 2 music i just know it
I love how they are fighting while schlatt is still stuck in the wall
i hope he does another for 10 mill, this was hillarious
3/4 of this video is just you guys trying to loot the tower

Charlie: "In remembrance of F*ckworld, I say we drop some bars" Jschlatt and Tommy: "uh uh uh -beatboxes-"
Tommy: "Come to the house everyone, wait wait wait! There's a pressure plate! Why is there a pressure plate?!" Jschlatt: "It's for the door dumbas$" Tommy: "Fu*k you, b*tch"
Hi 👋
Hey Tommy I’m 14 and have had a lot of mental issues lately and I was talking to myself and getting freaked out about life for the (insert number here)’th time and clicked on this video and immediately felt calm, thanks for helping me distract myself from the mental struggles of my dumbass life
Hey Tommy I’m 14 and have had a lot of mental issues lately and I was talking to myself and getting freaked out about life for the (insert number here)’th time and clicked on this video and immediately felt calm, thanks for helping me distract myself from the mental struggles of my dumbass life
You dragged Charlie back to RLcraft why he already had nightmare from the first time
Jachatt: and that's how i became Christian ✝
When Charlie said the dog is fluent in Spanish my mind went immediately to anime voice over of fmab
29:52 :D
0:24 JOJO

Nobody Tommyinnit:*plays jojo part 5 song at the start*
It easy to defeat the  Boss you tower up fishing rod him 5 time or more and the jump on the tower then he will be yeeted to the other side off the map and de spawn
NOT THE JOJO MUSIC
i can't wait to see when tommy, schlatt, and charlie try to fight a dragon

Tommy: I have a horn! Schlatt: Give it to me. *I’m going to have some **_fun._*  *that’s kinda SUS-*
Can someone tell me why the fuck Schlatt has a cardboard cutout of the Pope in his room EDIT: okay apparently this is just a Christian/Catholic thing (don’t remember which) because the church I donated blood at had a framed photo of the pope

This is the first one-off RL Craft video I've seen where the youtubers actually made progress!
I WAS LAUGHING HARD IN THE END WHERE SLIMECICLE DIED
Just subed cause of the jojo music.
The first thing i think of is why theres the jojo's bizzare adventure music
5:08 "Hey there beautiful- you don't have a face." 10/10 pickup line. 16:06 It's the famous Doot! :D 16:40 Seeing Schlatt just sit there when he could have easily respawned and save them both was agonizing.
In loving memory of f-ckworld
"oh im sure it'll be fine-- DIES"
the dude with the beard sounds like the giraffe from Madagascar

Everyone pls subscribe to Tommyinnit were close to 10 million
Mod: A single modification   Modpack: File or set up with multiple Mods inside.  What you are playing here is a Modpack, “the hardest modpack” not mod.
I watched one video just a couple seconds ago, and tommy had 9.59 million subscribers, I clicked in this one and checked again thinking it’s be the same, but now its 9.60 million. Let’s go.   Written: June 12, 2021. (Just a reminder for my future self to have some nostalgia.)

If chaotic was a video 😭🤚🏻
I'm only on the second video of my 'being subscribed to tommyinnit' adventure, and I've quickly come to the conclusion that it's the rollercoaster of emotions that you get out on that makes these so hilarious- it's a master class of storytelling and comedy truly 😂💙
Tommy got some nice rhymes, though.
14:06 Charlie got Philza Minecrafted
cool
Just like Lagend of Zelda fucking style  Link : *WHAT*
Please continue this series for the contnent I love watching 2 grown men and a child struggling on RLCRAFT
The tacit centimeter strangely trouble because fang symptomatically delight of a kind euphonium. lively, venomous vase
Me when i click video: Oh, this should be nice  Me when i listen to intro music, OH, THIS IS JOJO, THIS SHOULD BE VERY NICE
The known bladder excitingly crash because suede yearly haunt given a envious cannon. careful, actually bowling
Fuck world And the other one was everything to them rip😔
tommy's rap was actually good lol
I love how the "boss" is the one of the least dangerous  thing from the entire mod
Tommy's subs grow faster than poki tier 3 sub count🤣
Can someone tell me what that epic boss music is called
once you get a dragon egg you’re literally god now
Someone make a remix of Charlie's and Tommys raps they're actually fire
gotta respect the jojo music at the start
That's ominouse then slimecicle just says ah yes the time is nie so calm
# trollcraft
Anyone know the name of this song at 0:29
I love you juice world
We miss you juice 999 for life
I never thought I'd see Charlie back in rlcraft
999
It’s wimothy
6:51 *grabs cat* _"i have to offer a sacrifice"_ this shit hurt my stomach lmfao
4:30 "this is my posture" i have never related more to a statement a youtuber has made ever in my life
I love to play RLCraft, it’s really fun even if it’s hard
Imagine if this was a series
“His name was f***world, now he’s dead. I don’t have enough skill to eat this bread.”
6:33 When Jschlatt gets so scared after getting struck by lightning that he recites the whole Apostles Creed.
𝕐𝕠𝕦𝕣 𝕘𝕠𝕠𝕕 Tommy☺
“Survived” is a lie
I wondered where the sad Destiny 2 music was coming from at first. poor fuckworld
this comment was not made near this videos creating, but on june 21st my birthday is comming up! (this isnt the person uploading cringe on this channel lol, only the brother.)
F in the chat for Fuckworld Honestly best rapper (fun fact, Fuckworld got an unreleased ep, but I can't put it here cause links)
if they thought the overworld is scary, wait till the nether... i lost all my super op stuff from a big spider boss thing 🤣🤣🤣
9.5 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS POGGERS IN COMMENTS
Every time its intense *JOJO's BIzzare adventure music kicks in*
BYE THE JOJO MUSIC IS SENDING ME,, SIR TOMMETHY INNIT? ARE YOU A JOJO FAN?
THe first part was jojo's bizzare adventure music LES GO!
Tbh, tommy your good at rapping
RIP Fuckworld
7:37 "IS THAT THE GRIM REAPER?!?!?"
Me vibin to the intro; *JOJO DUDUDUDUDUDUDU GOLDEN WIND DUDUDUDDUDUDU*
i-is nobody gonna talk about that jojo reference
Charlie going “boots and cats and boots and cats” for Tommy’s beat is the best
8:58 "but he's actually completely fluent in spanish"  please don't remind me of the fuckin' spanish schlatt dog bit
how bout with boffy again!
Tower* Dungeon boss is pretty ez to kill actually RLcraft is the best for hardcore modpack* 4 survivin Tommy u’ve got stone greatsword hold right click and release it after few seconds it will do an AOE atk. Long sword only increases attack range of the sword.   Another small tip last 2 floors where boss is and below him the chests there u can’t open them and when try to the boss “activates” and blows his way 2 u 2 kill u butt u can sneak onto the last lvl where boss is break the blocks on top and pus him down with knockback sword on punch bow or just push him down by hittin his ass.  Also when the boss dies tower self destructs and those explosions can kill ya pretty easily 😂😂  OR u guys can just get first normal armour or at least normal swords and a lil bit of armour and go to the tower (other tower.)
This video is a golden experience
GUYS. HACK FOR THOSE TOWERS: if u build to the top and use a fishing rod to hook the boss then after a min of fishing him u can shoot him and he gets launched away. the tower then doesnt explode and you can loot it from the top down and take ur time. JUST SAYING IVE NEVER ACTUALLY PLAYED THIS MODPACK BUT IVE WATCHED WAY TO MANY VIDEOS SO IF THIS IS SLIGHTLY INACCURATE PLEASE CORRECT ME!!! also love u tommy <3
i love how they just put in the sad song from destiny 2 forsaken at 17:50
Press F for fuckworld
In indonesian name mod is rlcraft
Bruh I like how the thumbnail is nothing like to actual video lol love the videos tommy!
Dream team, but a different family branch Subbed bro
Dad took my earbuds because I got in trouble but he underestimated the fact that Tommyinnit videos are subtitled
0:27 background song name plzzz
"this skeleton has a trumpet"
i wish this was a new series 😩
Is no one going to talk about the amount of skill Tommy has for beat boxing and the amazing freestyle Charlie had preformed? Like dang, have some respect for it
I hope he watched jojo so he put that music in
is it bad that I actually cried when fuckworld died-?

I’d expect Tommy to know more as he played RL craft with boffy
I love how Tommy and Charlie are just enjoying their time meanwhile Schlatt is sacrificing cats to the pope and is fighting off lighting strikes plus things that seem like they come from horror games lmao

What is the intro music? I'm kinda fond of it but I don't know why.
If you do this again the half hearted bauble and the emerald ring are good they can boost your health damage jump height stepping height and also have special abilities like the half hearted makes you sometimes not die when you do but turn your hearts to half until you sleep it basically gives you another life and the plasters and bandages you found are good because they let you heal
Lol I like how the editor censored for the first 2 mins then just stopped
what is the intro music?
Tommy & Charli: *dying*  Schlatt: I’m stuck in the wall

God the Father sent His Son, Jesus, to take your punishment for your sins: to die on the cross.  For the wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23, KJV)  You must repent of all your sins, and believe and trust in Jesus. He loves you. He took your punishment, and suffered, because He loves you. He can forgive you. He can give you a new heart. Have a relationship with Him. He wants to have a relationship with you. God wants you to be His child.  God bless you all.

Ok here's a little post that I hope can help you guys! I don't even know if you'll SEE IT but I've been playing rlcraft for fun for a bit and thought you might enjoy a few quick tips here! Please like this so tommy might have a CHANCE of seeing it!  This is just beginner stuff, if you want a late game one later I'd love to make one for you guys!   Biggest things and how to deal with them:  Dragons!  HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM: Dragons stick in a certain proximity to their nest. Fire dragon nests have gold in them, and Ice dragons have silver. If you go underground and find a dragon nest, be warned! That is a level five! level five dragons are the one dragon type that will NOT stay by their nests once they are woken up! Level five dragons are the only ones that have a chance of dropping DRAGON EGGS! You can raise them, but I would suggest saving that for late game! BASICALLY! Do not go near nests unless you can speed the fuck out of there. They will be alerted if you break their gold, so I'd just avoid them until late game.   SEASONS!  NEED TO KNOW: Seasons aren't exactly something you beat, because they're going to beat you. Once winter comes, you're kinda f*cked if you don't have a way of keeping yourself warm! The easiest way is to wear wool armor and sit next to a campfire for a while. Otherwise, in mid-late winter, you will freeze to death every time you go outside. (I would suggest making a season clock to help tell what season it is) CROPS! Certain crops are only able to be grown in certain seasons! The crops and their various seasons are as follows:  SPRING: Carrots and Potatoes  SUMMER: Melon, Sugarcane, and Wheat  AUTUMN: Beetroot, Carrot, Pumpkin, and Wheat.  Saplings, flowers, and ferns grow in every season  MOST HELPFUL THINGS TO HAVE/KNOW ABOUT IN RLCRAFT:  SUMMONING STAFF! Bone, gold, eye of ender! thats all you need for a summoning staff! One of the most OP weapons in rlcraft. It can be used to summon mobs to fight for you! Press B to go into the menu, it's all very straightforward. I HIGHLY suggest getting one of these and leveling up your magic to use it.  Backpacks! there is a mod installed that gives you a backpack! You can put items in it, though it does replace your chest plate. When you die, your items will not despawn if they have been put inside the backpack. Its a very helpful item to have as you can craft them and carry them with you anywhere, as well as being able to place them and use them as chests!  Healing items! Bandages and shit are pretty useful if you're just going on a quick expedition, or on a perilous trip into the mines! Certain healing items can be held and just used on different body parts, or just held and used to heal overall body health. Keep your head on your shoulders, bois! If your head gets hit three times, your entire body is down for the count!  WEAPONS! There is a mod installed that gives you different weapons with different uses, I would say the best one is the halberd, as it does ASSLOADS of damage and has good reach! Also, if you use a two handed weapon with a shield, your attack speed will be very much so impaired! (u fight slow)  COMPANIONS VERY IMPORTANT!  When I say companions I mean pets and mounts that you can have! I saw you guys lose fuckworld, and I thought you might want to know about this stuff if you keep any more pets.  SOULSTONES! A soulstone is made by using a soulgazer, four eyes of ender, and four diamonds. A soulgazer can be used more than once to make more soulstones, but a soulstone can only be used ONCE on a tamed mob! I am telling you how to make a stone before how to tame, because in RLCRAFT it's foolish to go and tame a creature without having a soulstone to bind it! The reason being, once a creature is bound it can be revived/ summoned even after it dies over and over- after a cool down of about two minutes, of course. Soulstones can be used on pets and mountable creatures!  TAMING: You must make different treats depending on what you are trying to tame! The best mounts in the game are the morock and the roc, as they are tamable FLYING creatures and make travel a lot easier! As well as making it so you can fight large creatures from long range, and shoot battletower golems RIGHT OFF THEIR TOWERS! Rocs are the easiest and most common. You just need avian treats and a saddle! (SADDLES CAN BE CRAFTED). Once you have tamed it, use your soulstone and boom! Eternal companion!! You can also put chests on them and use them as storage that you can summon at will!   The best armor in the game is seaserpent armor, by the by. Seaserpents are vicious beasts, though! So be wary!   Battletowers are the best way to get loot quickly, so if you defeat the golem up top everything will breakdown.   NETHER IS NOT WORTH IT IN MY OPINION. JUST DEATH THERE.   final quick tips!  Enchant, enchant, enchant!  Dynamic trees can break your fall if you jump on to them!  JEI (just enough items) can tell you how to craft anything you could possibly want!    I hope this helps y'all! If you even see it!   Have a great day, and don't let rlcraft beat ya down! YOU GOT THIS!
Top 3 rappers Eminem is afraid to rap battle against

MAKE THIS A SERIES TOMMY
Nobody: Gen Z humor: 17:42
tommy: are you okay????  schlatt: *monkey noises*

Where girls cried: titanic Where boys cried: avengers endgame Where men cried: 16:30
watch ot hes got the *bart grasp*
When shlatt growled ( 11:00 )  i immediately did the same thing and I am ashamed that was what my Instinct was
Poor gayshlatt
The JJBA music made the beginning of the video better for me I don’t know about you guys
Lol
Charlie’s panic is so goddamn funny when you remember he also did a video on RL Craft and it was just as crazy and feverish.
Soooo...... Did he die at the end?
Jshlatt: “yeah I’m ok I’m ok! Two seconds later: “I’M NOT OKAY I’M NOT OKAY”
Get Tommy to 10 mil or my gang will attack you (me and my gang make Tommy reffrances)
He's played RLCRAFT with Boffy before and he acts like he's never even played this
U not at 10mil :(
When fuckworld died i recognize that song thats from Destiny 2 its called “Journey” :D
NOOOOO FUCK WORLD
All the childhood memories come flooding back
oh god
You remember you played with boffy
o7. rest in peace FuckWorld.
I can hear the wind... a golden wind!
YOOOOO TOMMY PLAY A JOJO REFERENCE IN THE BEGINNING

PLS NO BADWORDS IM A KID IDIOT
13:19 Man I didn't know slime was Russian
This dude has more likes on this video than I’ve ever seen...
Was that a jojo reference
7:29 I love that this modpack manages to make "Are you smart enough to use it" an actual question instead of an insult
f in the chat for fuckworld and the other one
RL Schlatt : "am I having a heart attack ?" Dream SMP Schlatt : "does anyone else smell toast ?"
"I Survived Minecraft's Hardest Mod..."  **dies a million times**
Who else is getting diamond dimensions vibes
RIP: fuckworld
What's the first song, I swear I recognize it!!!

Goals for next RLCraft video : slay a dragon
Funny you should k ow Schlatt and Tommy have gone through thr horrors of rl craft.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏✨✨✨✨
YES YES AND YES I DIED LAUGHING BC I COULD NEVER-
Modpack*
100 days in this not hardcore with the Bois Phil slime and ninja at 10 mil pin this
Tommy is still annoying and still a child and trying to be a men
the intro music sounded weird without the kazoo
Is Tommy a Jojo fan?
the intro feels like a jojo reference
i'm just surprised when i heard destiny 2 music
yes i love it
my favorite part is 19:08 BORN TO DIE
Ngl, but I think that the towers were also in DanTDM's diamond dimensions series. I think they're called battle towers. Not sure tho.
Watch DOMINION, EARTHLINGS & SEASPIRACY 👁️🐳🐥🐷🐮 Try Challenge22 💚
0:25 is the nostalgic intro when tommy's contwnt was dream smp and the lmanburg war
"Hes name was fuckworld now he is dead, i don't have enough skill to eat this bread" Damm, that's some good bars over there
Rlcraft
I love the fucking destiny music during the death of fuckworld
I dont know Tommy doesn't realizes this...    But he is making everybody's quarantine 100000 times better
6:40 why does he just know the lords prayer offhead LMAO
Why do I here destiny 2 music
giorno 2.0
Tommy can actually rap though
Is this mod rlcraft?
We must create a shrine for Fuckworld o7 🕊 Fuckworld. R.I.P

4:30 Charlie once said, "this is my posture".
Sad Destiny 2 music, epic
Thank you tommyinnit no toxic in it anymore lovely innit now  Edit:i guess there is still toxic innit🙄🙄🙄
"I'm pretty sure God was affronted by what we said "  *Schlatt turns to look the pope*
this video was probably my favorite yet lmfao
Fuckworld, will always be remembered
Tommy all imma say is tHat1234 = Tubbo :)
I did not think I could wheeze but I bow know I can  Rip fuckworld
2:40 even though jschaltt hit Tommy he could've still kept going cause in rlcraft when you mine a block it doesn't reset to normal after you look away for a while loll
Hey does anyone remember heterosexual homies??
He uses giorno theme
respec for the destiny 2 OST
I think this video is more about fuckworld
It is true fuck world  😔
Fuck world
Bruh how did this even get unlikes???
JOJO LETS GOOOO
Anyone else surprised Tommy can sing that well
next time you play rlcraft you gotta invite calvin so you actually have a chance at life
its not hard you just gotta get good and get some pollen from the bees and this is rl craft (im not a hater its a joke lol)
_____________ [Rip fuckworld]                 []♡                     ¡[and the other one]¡

Not the death screen saying rest in rice 💀
Nice Jo Jo intro Tommy. Also, do something special at 10 mil. Suprise us.

ya'll hear FUCKWORLD's new track _FUCKLAVA_ ?
saying youtube keeps unsubscribing people is a scam but meh not trying to create fight in comments pls
Honestly idk what’s going on but it’s seems when I’m watching YouTubers play RL craft it’s a whole lot more intense than it is when I play
The Destiny 2 music at 17:15 killed me
18:35 man,dem bars doe😎
Episode 2 of the hardest modpacks please I love it
Episode 2 please
Schlatt: the pressure plate is just for the door dumbass.  Charlie: don't you ever assume that ever again.  **a few minutes later**  *fuckword dies from a pressure plate*
Bro this dude got 9 million people to like him enough to sub in about a year. Wow.
Hi toomy

YEEEAAAAAAAAAA MY THEMEEEEE
Make a hardest mod survival series and defeat every boss
Schlatt mentioning hexxit just makes me want to go back to when him and Phil were making Hexxit streams... Sad
Tommy, some people only beat the  golem with leather armor.Try beat a stage five dragon
I don’t think the little kids understand what schlatt means by he’s gonna have fun with the horn
i love the sad D2 music  and R.I.P fuckworld
You could have just towered up... XD

"I fell through the floor"  He just explained the backrooms in one sentence.
You have died many times and still you say that you survived it

0:12 AMOGUS
The hours i have spent on this fucking modpack i will never get back. It changes you
When the dogs died I literally cried
26:38
I love you
I love how scared shlat looks everytime he has to fight
Only they can make a first playthrough just bearable to watch after you yourself have played the game.
Charlie: "it's simple, it's simple. either 1: you're going to bed or 2--" _Schlatt proceeds to scream in fear_
Aye yo man the jojo tune
I'm not high on drugs -Schlatt 2021
Title=i survived minecrafts hardest mod. Also everyone=DYING
Does the editor kind of enjoy Jojo? or is it just a random Song find
0:05 [𝗝𝗼𝗝𝗼 𝗿𝗲𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘀 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴]
BITCH YOU MEAN HARDEST MOD——pack
I thought slimesicle was gonna turn into a bounty hunter or some shit
Its like watching a movie
Im sad because tommy play destiny 2 music while fuck world died
HOLY SHIT! Tommy's intro w-was a.... *JOJO REFERNCE???!?!?!??!?!?!?*
The fuckin jojo music at the start was great
I just checked yesterday and you had 9.23M and now you have 9.25M
What son was used at the start of this video anyone?
OMFG Im fucking dying when u started u saying I don't have enough skill to eat this bread
Revenge for f world and other one ,’(
he looked the devil in the eyes and screamed
Creeper - noob Dragon - pro Dungeon boss - hacker *Socksfor1 - GOD*
20:28 Ok that was cool-
hes channel subscription is fast btw tommy your close to diamond button and congrats for 9million
I just realized, while Schlatt was mourning fuckworld, he started cuddling with Jambo...
KSI vs Tommy who wins lol
Fortnite call-outs on a next-level
is no one gonna metion that there is the jojo theme playing in the beginning
but what if it was hardcore mode?😏
Fun fact: this isn't Tommy's first time playing rlcraft, he played with boffy around a year ago
4:38        charlie likes trees
"am I having a heart attack" SCHLATT I SWEAR TO GOD THE FLASHBACKS
I just like the Giorgio theme
*30 minute tommyinnit video*
I also hope they do maybe 100 days RLCraft? Imagine dream, techo, ranboo, philza and charlie
For those who watched Popularmmos you know the tower isn’t that hard lol
*I just had a heart attack because of laughing so godamn much*
"His name was fvckworld and he is dead. *I don't have enough skill to eat this bread."*
I love this video please its so chaotic
18:44 That's actually hard tho😂😂🔥
17:38 OMFG😂😂😂💀
Good music choice
15:44 LMFAOOO BRUH😂😂😂
Fuck world and the other one.... 😩😫🥺
This video reminds me of adventure time for some reason
Tommy you and schlatt is the kind of people I would like to be friends with
"i give him two seconds" "one-" *jschlatt dies* LMFAO
16:12 SANS IS THAT YOU!?
i love the intro music
RIP Fuckworld. You were the best damn rapper of all time
Where so close to  7 mil-    Nah bruh we so close to 10 mil

yo those bars tho
I've never heard Schlatt scream so loud in any video MULTIPLE TIMES IN A ROW
I choked on some *rice* when the rap about fuckworld started

10M CMON TOMMY MAKE IT TO 10M
why is tommy actually decent at rapping lmaoo
Its the rapping for me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Si (yes)
Bruh just get a flying pet, a fishing rod, and a bow. Fishing rodding them doesnt work until you hit en and flying mount makes them not notice you, and you can fishing rod them 5 times then bow em and they fly of then you can loot the tower.
that was a very intence fight with 2 immortal beings and 1 immortal child
At first you laughed like a chilld
pog
The title is incorrect, they didnt survive. The title should be getting destroyed and dying multiple times in RLCraft
What is the name of the song in the beginning
PLZ THE JOJO THEME IN THE BEGINNING-
REMEMBER THIS WITH BOFFY????
Fuck world got his world fucked.
I heard a fucking lego batman song 3:02

18:32 In memory of (Oof)world...

Tommy says "why is that so big?" Jschlatt says "that's dangerous! You gotta be careful with that" and that raised George's confidence by 99.

Boffy flashbacks
5:26 😳
OMG love the JoJo theme! 😍😍😍😁😁😁(my Name is JoJo)
2:53 schatts face 😂
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLRQdDTUUUDP3_8Ym8xQ3sg
Schlatt could of just respawned as soon as he died so that fuckworld could teleport to him before running in
21:43
Rip funk world.. and the other one I guess.
so are we just going to ignore the background music ?
Jojo remix yessir
Rip Fuckworld
0:27 from what anime is this song?

THAT INTRO IS SO DRAMATIC BUT I LOVED IT SO MUCH
i want to see them go to the nether in this mod

*Schlatt sounds like Ranboo*
The JoJos music is a vibe tho
RIP "FUCKWORLD" AND "THE OTHER ONE"
Why is no one talking about Charlie’s rap, I have been replaying it over and over again  Fuckin slaps
Jojo music be like

If you thought rlcraft is hard, try out severe craft...
Tommy's mom: What do you have there?  Tommy: A KNIFE Tommy's mom: NO
Anyone else know the tower from the PopularMMOs Epic Proportions series? Good times...good times.
Me being a veteran at this mod, what is this gameplay huh?
Tommy: "I got crack!"
6:55 bruhhhh
This would be a great series for rlcraft
thats the WEAKEST mini boss
This is my fourth time watching this video already, idk why but the length is perfect to get a whole story in from beginning to end (even though Tommy does an amazing job at doing that every video) I really like how this one was laid out. Instead of small bits, since the vid is longer, each chain of bits is a part of one section and now you have multiple sections laid out in a 30 min mod video.
Tommy: mans got a shank.  Me: how British
WHAT IS THE SAD SONG WHEN THE DOGS DIE I NEED TO KNOWWW
Tommy is actually good at rapping no cap lmao
there is a vid in your ads bro
Like how schlatt apologizes to the pipe
This should be a series
rlcraft is EASY
fuck ya just the jojo theme song at the start XD
Tomy is like the biggest simp
FUCK WORLD
Good song
0:00
It’s just rl craft

17:57 made me laugh sooooooooo much. His name was flip world and now hes dead. I dont have enough skills to eat this bread.
Schlatt may act edgy, but hell he's the most adorable man on earth when he hugs jambo
Rip F*ckWorld 2021-2021
schlatt going into battle fully decked with armor and weapons is the most jarring thing lmao
Tommylinnit you have played rlcraft my guy
Rip fuck world😭
0:12 amogus
You need a pop filter.
Just jschlatt with nunchucks tho

I remember when he played this with boffy
24:40 tommy sounded like skeppy for a moment
Please do more of this
PvE gods of the century
If you know where the Destiny 2 music is played in D2, the moment is just kinda offputting /j
This brings back so many Memories from hexxit.

WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT GIORNO'S THEME🤡
tommy my Sokkar daddy
I tried Rlcraft and I encountered a house in the woods. There was a door creaking open sound. I hid myself in the house, I tried to eat in the dark. It said in the chat that " You're most likely not get eaten by something ". " You can't eat in the pitch black ". " It stopped, at least for now "
Tommy pls do a you cring you lose pls
YOU WILL BE IN SWEDISH TV NEXT WEEK! IM SO EXITED TO SEE IT :D
U are going to be on the Swedish news next Friday.
I have an idea of a fun thing to try, its when everything is whatever block, so you might mine a diamond and it could be a stick but it would still appear as a diamond until you try to use it. It would be very challenging and the whole point would be to beat the game. I think it could get 100,000 likes easyyyy. Please try it.
uhm tommy i think im your child i swear to much and im a child
how does this video have half a milion likes?
Noooooooo fuckworld
TOMMY YOU CAN TAME SOME BEASTS!!!

Hello Tommy, I wanted to say thank you for this past year, you’ve helped a lot of people including me through some bad times,and I really wanted to say thank you, I have bipolar depression and I’m had some thoughts, but without you knowing you’ve helped me not do said things, so again thank you Tommy.

Rest In Peace fuck world

Hey Tommy, I’ve been watching your videos for quite some time now. And I’ve seen you play Fnaf, I think it would be cool if you play it again?

Rip the other one
“So it’s true what they say... Fuck world.”      - Charlie Slimecicle
I cant wait for episode 2
his name was fuckworld and now he is dead  i dont have enough skill to eat this bread
I like the beginning with the theme
I am still wondering if he turns 18, will he still be an child or an old man?
a charger is like life support for a phone
10:14
do you still have the vr headset it will be fun with rl craft
Remember when he and boffy used to do this lol
Ok here's a little post that I hope can help you guys! I don't even know if you'll SEE IT but I've been playing rlcraft for fun for a bit and thought you might enjoy a few quick tips here! Please like this so tommy might have a CHANCE of seeing it!  This is just beginner stuff, if you want a late game one later I'd love to make one for you guys!   Biggest things and how to deal with them:  Dragons!  HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM: Dragons stick in a certain proximity to their nest. Fire dragon nests have gold in them, and Ice dragons have silver. If you go underground and find a dragon nest, be warned! That is a level five! level five dragons are the one dragon type that will NOT stay by their nests once they are woken up! Level five dragons are the only ones that have a chance of dropping DRAGON EGGS! You can raise them, but I would suggest saving that for late game! BASICALLY! Do not go near nests unless you can speed the fuck out of there. They will be alerted if you break their gold, so I'd just avoid them until late game.   SEASONS!  NEED TO KNOW: Seasons aren't exactly something you beat, because they're going to beat you. Once winter comes, you're kinda f*cked if you don't have a way of keeping yourself warm! The easiest way is to wear wool armor and sit next to a campfire for a while. Otherwise, in mid-late winter, you will freeze to death every time you go outside. (I would suggest making a season clock to help tell what season it is) CROPS! Certain crops are only able to be grown in certain seasons! The crops and their various seasons are as follows:  SPRING: Carrots and Potatoes  SUMMER: Melon, Sugarcane, and Wheat  AUTUMN: Beetroot, Carrot, Pumpkin, and Wheat.  Saplings, flowers, and ferns grow in every season  MOST HELPFUL THINGS TO HAVE/KNOW ABOUT IN RLCRAFT:  SUMMONING STAFF! Bone, gold, eye of ender! thats all you need for a summoning staff! One of the most OP weapons in rlcraft. It can be used to summon mobs to fight for you! Press B to go into the menu, it's all very straightforward. I HIGHLY suggest getting one of these and leveling up your magic to use it.  Backpacks! there is a mod installed that gives you a backpack! You can put items in it, though it does replace your chest plate. When you die, your items will not despawn if they have been put inside the backpack. Its a very helpful item to have as you can craft them and carry them with you anywhere, as well as being able to place them and use them as chests!  Healing items! Bandages and shit are pretty useful if you're just going on a quick expedition, or on a perilous trip into the mines! Certain healing items can be held and just used on different body parts, or just held and used to heal overall body health. Keep your head on your shoulders, bois! If your head gets hit three times, your entire body is down for the count!  WEAPONS! There is a mod installed that gives you different weapons with different uses, I would say the best one is the halberd, as it does ASSLOADS of damage and has good reach! Also, if you use a two handed weapon with a shield, your attack speed will be very much so impaired! (u fight slow)  COMPANIONS VERY IMPORTANT!  When I say companions I mean pets and mounts that you can have! I saw you guys lose fuckworld, and I thought you might want to know about this stuff if you keep any more pets.  SOULSTONES! A soulstone is made by using a soulgazer, four eyes of ender, and four diamonds. A soulgazer can be used more than once to make more soulstones, but a soulstone can only be used ONCE on a tamed mob! I am telling you how to make a stone before how to tame, because in RLCRAFT it's foolish to go and tame a creature without having a soulstone to bind it! The reason being, once a creature is bound it can be revived/ summoned even after it dies over and over- after a cool down of about two minutes, of course. Soulstones can be used on pets and mountable creatures!  TAMING: You must make different treats depending on what you are trying to tame! The best mounts in the game are the morock and the roc, as they are tamable FLYING creatures and make travel a lot easier! As well as making it so you can fight large creatures from long range, and shoot battletower golems RIGHT OFF THEIR TOWERS! Rocs are the easiest and most common. You just need avian treats and a saddle! (SADDLES CAN BE CRAFTED). Once you have tamed it, use your soulstone and boom! Eternal companion!! You can also put chests on them and use them as storage that you can summon at will!   The best armor in the game is seaserpent armor, by the by. Seaserpents are vicious beasts, though! So be wary!   Battletowers are the best way to get loot quickly, so if you defeat the golem up top everything will breakdown.   NETHER IS NOT WORTH IT IN MY OPINION. JUST DEATH THERE.   final quick tips!  Enchant, enchant, enchant!  Dynamic trees can break your fall if you jump on to them!  JEI (just enough items) can tell you how to craft anything you could possibly want!    I hope this helps y'all! If you even see it!   Have a great day, and don't let rlcraft beat ya down! YOU GOT THIS!
Tommy is the pog god
“His name is fuckworld now he is dead, I don’t have enough levels to eat this bread”

I JUST KILLED A SKELETON AND IT BECAME THE UNDEAD... -Tommyinnit

When Tommy uses music from the an anime (Jojo’s) 😏😏

I feel like this is the only video that might not be scripted
THAT FACE LMAO 7:38
Worst youtuber ever
this is officially my new favourite video
I just realized I have the same birthday as this man
Hey brothers and sisters, I love y'all and it's just been in my heart today to share that Jesus love y'all so much and unconditionally. I don't know how much time we left on this earth before Jesus comes, but I want all of us to be ready when He does. Let's leave these things of this world behind for in scripture it says in Matthew 24:35 that heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. " Also in 2 corinthians 4:18" So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal." Time is so short. And I always say this" I want all of us to be saved. " Jesus is coming back soon." with tears in my eyes I love you guys. Let's take Jesus and His words seriously in these time were in. I know the road isn't easy because there are so much distractions and temptations in this life. But through prayer and fasting we can overcome them. I don't want to force anything on anybody or even force them to do something they don't. But if you were to see your mother about to get hit by a big truck, you would do everything to try and save her. So I do the same thing for us about the wrath of God that is to come. I don't want anyone I love, know/don't know or even those who hate or dislike me to face such things. Because I know every soul is precious to God and are valuable to Him. Because before we were born He know us, He knitted us in our mother's womb, He called us to be His children . His love for us is so great and so strong, it's beyond human comprehension, that even the angels in heaven don't understand it. So I want to tell you it's time to get ready, time to prepare ourselves for the Second Coming of Christ, for the trails and tribulations and for the rapture. As you can see, so many people have turned away from God. The world has become so immoral, wicked, disgusting and violent. Killing people without any care or heart. And that shows that the love of God is growing cold in the hearts of people. Please be ready for when the Son of Man comes. Time is running out. Let's not leave this world with regrets. Because I tell you this, my biggest regret is not knowing Jesus Christ earlier. I love you Guys and Jesus loves you too, that's why He didn't think twice about dying on the Cross for us, knowing that we may not even love Him back. Please take what was said today in consideration because ready or not Jesus Christ is coming back believe it or not Jesus is coming back .   How to be saved? To be saved, a man must confess that Jesus is Lord while acknowledging in his heart that Christ must have full rule over his life and that he died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected on the third day🙏🏾. Also one must repent and turn away from thier sin. NOW, is the time to turn to JESUS, do it before its too LATE and the DOOR of Grace is Shut.  Prayer of Salvation in Jesus Christ🙏  Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior.  Spreading the Gospel on every content🙏❤️🤗❤️
"Am I having a heart attack" You see that's funny because-
o7 to fuckworld

Shivaxi would be happy people playing his mod religiously
Ok here's a little post that I hope can help you guys! I don't even know if you'll SEE IT but I've been playing rlcraft for fun for a bit and thought you might enjoy a few quick tips here! Please like this so tommy might have a CHANCE of seeing it!  This is just beginner stuff, if you want a late game one later I'd love to make one for you guys!   Biggest things and how to deal with them:  Dragons!  HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM: Dragons stick in a certain proximity to their nest. Fire dragon nests have gold in them, and Ice dragons have silver. If you go underground and find a dragon nest, be warned! That is a level five! level five dragons are the one dragon type that will NOT stay by their nests once they are woken up! Level five dragons are the only ones that have a chance of dropping DRAGON EGGS! You can raise them, but I would suggest saving that for late game! BASICALLY! Do not go near nests unless you can speed the fuck out of there. They will be alerted if you break their gold, so I'd just avoid them until late game.   SEASONS!  NEED TO KNOW: Seasons aren't exactly something you beat, because they're going to beat you. Once winter comes, you're kinda f*cked if you don't have a way of keeping yourself warm! The easiest way is to wear wool armor and sit next to a campfire for a while. Otherwise, in mid-late winter, you will freeze to death every time you go outside. (I would suggest making a season clock to help tell what season it is) CROPS! Certain crops are only able to be grown in certain seasons! The crops and their various seasons are as follows:  SPRING: Carrots and Potatoes  SUMMER: Melon, Sugarcane, and Wheat  AUTUMN: Beetroot, Carrot, Pumpkin, and Wheat.  Saplings, flowers, and ferns grow in every season  MOST HELPFUL THINGS TO HAVE/KNOW ABOUT IN RLCRAFT:  SUMMONING STAFF! Bone, gold, eye of ender! thats all you need for a summoning staff! One of the most OP weapons in rlcraft. It can be used to summon mobs to fight for you! Press B to go into the menu, it's all very straightforward. I HIGHLY suggest getting one of these and leveling up your magic to use it.  Backpacks! there is a mod installed that gives you a backpack! You can put items in it, though it does replace your chest plate. When you die, your items will not despawn if they have been put inside the backpack. Its a very helpful item to have as you can craft them and carry them with you anywhere, as well as being able to place them and use them as chests!  Healing items! Bandages and shit are pretty useful if you're just going on a quick expedition, or on a perilous trip into the mines! Certain healing items can be held and just used on different body parts, or just held and used to heal overall body health. Keep your head on your shoulders, bois! If your head gets hit three times, your entire body is down for the count!  WEAPONS! There is a mod installed that gives you different weapons with different uses, I would say the best one is the halberd, as it does ASSLOADS of damage and has good reach! Also, if you use a two handed weapon with a shield, your attack speed will be very much so impaired! (u fight slow)  COMPANIONS VERY IMPORTANT!  When I say companions I mean pets and mounts that you can have! I saw you guys lose fuckworld, and I thought you might want to know about this stuff if you keep any more pets.  SOULSTONES! A soulstone is made by using a soulgazer, four eyes of ender, and four diamonds. A soulgazer can be used more than once to make more soulstones, but a soulstone can only be used ONCE on a tamed mob! I am telling you how to make a stone before how to tame, because in RLCRAFT it's foolish to go and tame a creature without having a soulstone to bind it! The reason being, once a creature is bound it can be revived/ summoned even after it dies over and over- after a cool down of about two minutes, of course. Soulstones can be used on pets and mountable creatures!  TAMING: You must make different treats depending on what you are trying to tame! The best mounts in the game are the morock and the roc, as they are tamable FLYING creatures and make travel a lot easier! As well as making it so you can fight large creatures from long range, and shoot battletower golems RIGHT OFF THEIR TOWERS! Rocs are the easiest and most common. You just need avian treats and a saddle! (SADDLES CAN BE CRAFTED). Once you have tamed it, use your soulstone and boom! Eternal companion!! You can also put chests on them and use them as storage that you can summon at will!   The best armor in the game is seaserpent armor, by the by. Seaserpents are vicious beasts, though! So be wary!   Battletowers are the best way to get loot quickly, so if you defeat the golem up top everything will breakdown.   NETHER IS NOT WORTH IT IN MY OPINION. JUST DEATH THERE.   final quick tips!  Enchant, enchant, enchant!  Dynamic trees can break your fall if you jump on to them!  JEI (just enough items) can tell you how to craft anything you could possibly want!    I hope this helps y'all! If you even see it!   Have a great day, and don't let rlcraft beat ya down! YOU GOT THIS!
Tears for fuckworld

Part 2
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago He left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make.   Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 )  ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Hi tommy can i get a heart please

Jshallt: praying The pope in background: -~-
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
Jschlatt being struck by lightning and immediately turning to the Pope

Can this be a let’s play
This is a fever dream..
7:00 Me: No Schlatt he's just a child, you can't do that, he is just an adorable child with beady eyes that are screaming to you.
Is nobody gonna talk about the fact that when Charlie was stuttering because Schlatt got struck by lighting, he said "Wojcicki"?
Their goal was to beat the dungeon boss even though you can make it instantly die using 1 arrow and a fishing rod
Hi tommyinnit hi
fuck world
Charlie had some serious PTSD
Holy shit the unsub glitch is real...
how dare he sacrifice da cat
Mans got a shank 😂🤣😭🤣😭
Schlatt: the lucky one Tommy: the adventuring one that gets into way too much trouble Charlie: the one trying to keep the group together but failing miserably

So no one boutta talk about gironos theme?
Now they have to do a Jojo mod pack
Bruh Tommy uses all the music i love. Journey from Destiny 2 made me cry when the dogs died
Is that starting music after tommy said we did not something from jojos bizarre adventure
I like at first slime is giving tommy lessons but tommy already played rlcraft with boffy.
This is timmyinnit then right? Who is this guy                     JK
The thumbnail changed
rip fuckworld your drippyness will forever be remeberd XD
You know what’s just annoying to me they missed the other chest all the way on the top where the battle golem spawns and they didn’t get it
I still don’t get the hype of these creators I honestly dont see it
"It's a Bipedal Lobster"
This would be a good series
I cant believe "survived" is the video title
lol they don't know about the fishing rod trick
My guy really pretending he ain't play this with boffy
Tommy free dream and go back to the SMP if dream does not respond nicely and come clean then he will be executed who are the absolute last time no exceptions quackety is going to kill him because he knows that you will not care and he will destroy dream at june 2nd  3:00 PM

Wasn't this the same mod that Tommy and Boffy did?
17:08 is anyone going to mention the d2 red war campaign music being played
I got banned on the discord in less than 1 min cuz I said slow mode is gay. This is lack of freedom of speech. So I guess the discord is like the Chinese government. I still like Tommyinnit so I will keep watching him but someone plz unban me :(
The tower....little nightmares 2....I see the connection anybody else?
Oh my god I was dying of the laughter!! 😂😂
Pog
I liked the gironos theme
These are my favorite videos on youtube
Love how he claims to have survived literallly every vid... INSANE CLICKBATE (memes no hate)
Just an insider tip the longsword is good for range but the rapier blocks 50% of damage
0:17 YOOOO TOMMMMMYYYY GOT KSI ON HOS RECOMMENDED!
Rip gods
Tommy's scream at 24:36 is the best thing I've ever heard
Shit content ok bye now
Wait- wait- I was genuinely impressed & surprised when Charlie rapped... o ok, n Tommy too 😃✋🏼😂

“He doesn’t speak English” “But he sure is fluent in Spanish”  Was that... *was that a reference?*
"I survived"  no you didn't

Why- why is there a pressure plate on the floor Schlatt: It's for the door dummy  Charlie: Schlatt, never make that kind of assumption ever again or you'll be instantly killed.  Schlatt: *Doesnt believe him* *After a while* Schlatt dies from a PRESSURE PLATE TRAP and also kills f**k world and other dog • - •

Random fact: TommyInnit is taller than my dad. 😬
When schlatt looked over at the Pope i just 💀💀 AND THEN HE STARTED FEELING AROUND HIM 😭😭😭
the greatest pain a man can feel, all of his dogs dying..
Dude 17:17 is the Destiny 2  "Journey" soundtrack from the red war
I don’t know if tommy knows this but there are 128 strongholds why am I saying this? dream smp purposes most likely won’t be seen though.
Tommy becuase of your vids i defeated 1 team in bedwars they called me "Motherfucker your so annoying" at the end of the game i called them "BITCHBOY"
markymencidor
I love hard drugs
“Am I having a heart attack?”  Schlatt my dude this is your second time now
I had no idea just how lucky Schlatt and Phil got when they tried this Edit: it was Hexxit but it’s super similar
The rightful string cytochemically bounce because salt specifically follow aside a condemned clam. nine, measly trade
Cxlvin: I can defeat the dungeon boss and kill 3 crazy bosses all by myself with a fishing rod  Tommyinnit:I need a crew of Youtubers The dungeon boSS is hard  Me: Full netherite armor and dying 3 times with a netherite sword

https://youtube.com/watch?v=sQByG7jZmgU&feature=shareWelcome to Gboard clipboard, any text you copy will be saved here.Tap on a clip to paste it in the text box.
what is the intro song its fire
I like how you put subtitles in the video so I can watch while no one hearing 😏
To anyone who reads this.. Jesus loves you, so much more than anyone on this earth ever could! He died for you and me on the Cross, conquering all sin so that we could be free, and have access to a life beyond, where there is no more agony or worries; only pure joy and everlasting happiness.. up there in Heaven!  This may be true, but the only way for that beautiful Sacrifice to have complete effect, you need to accept Jesus as your Lord and true Savior, and repent of all sin.  This is because we are binded to a flesh that will succumb to all kinds of desires, a flesh that is binded with sin by nature, sin that God doesn't love, and wants us, through that acceptance, to turn away from it and become pure.  Jesus wants you to be part of His eternal family, and wants to help you, strengthen you, fill your heart and restore you until the day we actually meet Him.  Life with Him is so much easier; Don't lose this chance because of this world's vanities. What we go through here and acquire is only temporary, and God wants us to strive for more than this... He is very close!  *John 3:16* "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."  God bless anyone who reads this, and again, Jesus loves you!😄
I just love the music during the boss fight it makes it seem more intence than it is
Shlatt: Am i having a heart attack? Me: AGAIN?!
Cries in remembering Tommy's collab with boffy
Tommy here playing Rl craft and says its hard "pff" its not that hard
I’ve been waiting for so long for this yesssssssss

4:38

OMG RLCraft
Am i the only one who wants them to start a rap beatbox gang ;v;?
R.I.P. FuckWorld
This should be a series
This is just PTSD for Charlie.
POV: you're actually younger than him but still call him child
Hello Strong Respectable TI
id love to see this as a series
At 23:21 it said you don’t meet the requirements to survive 🤣
"survived" lmao
Pls keep playing RLcraft 😂🙏
19:25 holy crab that’s good
watch sleepwalking dream vs night and riptide sapnap and slow down badboyhalo vs nightmare
THE MUSIC AT THE START YES
the intro song is jojo
Pls stop swearing for 14 hours if no I’m unsub
Lmao Slime having RLcraft flashbacks and becoming the veteran of the group trying to keep everyone alive...
I’m just Vibin to the jojo music
Hey everyone just want to plug someone’s channel really quick and btw he’s a kid his channel is called Harry French and tommy if you see this plz give him a shoutout he would get so excited ngl
Jschlatt looks so traumatized after what happened to fuckworld... 😭😭😭
JoJo’s music? Hmmmmmm JoJo’s fan?
When you want to watch a group of 3 man saying fuck welcome to the right video 🥰🤣
4:43 OOFFFFFFF REST IN PEACE CHARLIE
Damn, I was laughing my ass off for the entire video! I didn't laugh this much in the last weeks. A big thanks to you, Slimecicle and Jschlatt :)  Ps: Fuckworld will be remembered in the heart of everyone here T_T
Does anyone have the audio for the first like one minute of the video? The remix of the anime music thing? (I don’t watch anime so idk what it’s from)
no bc slime rapping sounds like a twenty one pilots song
6:18 gibberish
no offence, but ur all wimps. i defeated a dragon within a hour .-.
His name is fuck world and he is dead, i dont have enough skill points to eat this bread
You should play that parasite apocolypse mod next time, it's similar to rlcraft but creepy and you just need to discover the secrets of the lab that started it all and survive :)
The genuine fear on Jschlatt's face was killing me!
hey do anyone realize tommy kinda cut if someone say bad word do any realize it
Schlatt: am I having a heart attack? Me: Again?
that rap segment was actually pretty good
Why do call a bow and arrow a gun
>;0
Is your dog a whippet because if so, I have a whippet.
Don’t crit the baby zombie, that’s cruel. Kill it with fire instead, the nerves burn away in seconds, and then it’s painless!
4:38 i am dying😂
Do you ever feel like YouTube is your best friend during covid?
Union in the distance using the fishing rod method: *Laughs hysterically
I dont know whats worse being a YouTube celebrity or being a generic youtube celebrity following the same formula used to bait 12 year olds.
I subbed cuz of giorno's theme and becuz funni
Me: “are you kidding me yyyy didn’t I get a notificationnnn I just wanna watch tommyinnit videos”
16:07 guess you could say that skeleton was playing the trom-BONE    ill hang myself later
If this could be a series that would be amazing
Tommy innit is a genius in business
0:27 Is that a Jojo reference?!!! What? Someone had to do it :D
This kid beat Youtube seriously
If they only knew about the fishing rod glitch
18:14  Tommy:hes thinking about some fricked up shit  Jschat:petting his cat peacefully
Imagine playing this in hardcore
The unmonitored society lol
Only og's remember him playing it with Buffy
I love this part 30:59
Am I the only one who laughed when he typed "the other one" on the grave🤣
Nope the hardest is rlcraft the impossible version try it out
Tommy: "We only have one goal!" Also tommy: List's 2 Me: "Something is wrong here, but i can't seem to find out what"

What server do u play on? Is it a realm or is it a paid server?
Why are schlatt's screams to good
Sorry man, not skilled enough to spawn in ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Ok here's a little post that I hope can help you guys! I don't even know if you'll SEE IT but I've been playing rlcraft for fun for a bit and thought you might enjoy a few quick tips here! Please like this so tommy might have a CHANCE of seeing it!  This is just beginner stuff, if you want a late game one later I'd love to make one for you guys!   Biggest things and how to deal with them:  Dragons!  HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM: Dragons stick in a certain proximity to their nest. Fire dragon nests have gold in them, and Ice dragons have silver. If you go underground and find a dragon nest, be warned! That is a level five! level five dragons are the one dragon type that will NOT stay by their nests once they are woken up! Level five dragons are the only ones that have a chance of dropping DRAGON EGGS! You can raise them, but I would suggest saving that for late game! BASICALLY! Do not go near nests unless you can speed the fuck out of there. They will be alerted if you break their gold, so I'd just avoid them until late game.   SEASONS!  NEED TO KNOW: Seasons aren't exactly something you beat, because they're going to beat you. Once winter comes, you're kinda f*cked if you don't have a way of keeping yourself warm! The easiest way is to wear wool armor and sit next to a campfire for a while. Otherwise, in mid-late winter, you will freeze to death every time you go outside. (I would suggest making a season clock to help tell what season it is) CROPS! Certain crops are only able to be grown in certain seasons! The crops and their various seasons are as follows:  SPRING: Carrots and Potatoes  SUMMER: Melon, Sugarcane, and Wheat  AUTUMN: Beetroot, Carrot, Pumpkin, and Wheat.  Saplings, flowers, and ferns grow in every season  MOST HELPFUL THINGS TO HAVE/KNOW ABOUT IN RLCRAFT:  SUMMONING STAFF! Bone, gold, eye of ender! thats all you need for a summoning staff! One of the most OP weapons in rlcraft. It can be used to summon mobs to fight for you! Press B to go into the menu, it's all very straightforward. I HIGHLY suggest getting one of these and leveling up your magic to use it.  Backpacks! there is a mod installed that gives you a backpack! You can put items in it, though it does replace your chest plate. When you die, your items will not despawn if they have been put inside the backpack. Its a very helpful item to have as you can craft them and carry them with you anywhere, as well as being able to place them and use them as chests!  Healing items! Bandages and shit are pretty useful if you're just going on a quick expedition, or on a perilous trip into the mines! Certain healing items can be held and just used on different body parts, or just held and used to heal overall body health. Keep your head on your shoulders, bois! If your head gets hit three times, your entire body is down for the count!  WEAPONS! There is a mod installed that gives you different weapons with different uses, I would say the best one is the halberd, as it does ASSLOADS of damage and has good reach! Also, if you use a two handed weapon with a shield, your attack speed will be very much so impaired! (u fight slow)  COMPANIONS VERY IMPORTANT!  When I say companions I mean pets and mounts that you can have! I saw you guys lose fuckworld, and I thought you might want to know about this stuff if you keep any more pets.  SOULSTONES! A soulstone is made by using a soulgazer, four eyes of ender, and four diamonds. A soulgazer can be used more than once to make more soulstones, but a soulstone can only be used ONCE on a tamed mob! I am telling you how to make a stone before how to tame, because in RLCRAFT it's foolish to go and tame a creature without having a soulstone to bind it! The reason being, once a creature is bound it can be revived/ summoned even after it dies over and over- after a cool down of about two minutes, of course. Soulstones can be used on pets and mountable creatures!  TAMING: You must make different treats depending on what you are trying to tame! The best mounts in the game are the morock and the roc, as they are tamable FLYING creatures and make travel a lot easier! As well as making it so you can fight large creatures from long range, and shoot battletower golems RIGHT OFF THEIR TOWERS! Rocs are the easiest and most common. You just need avian treats and a saddle! (SADDLES CAN BE CRAFTED). Once you have tamed it, use your soulstone and boom! Eternal companion!! You can also put chests on them and use them as storage that you can summon at will!   The best armor in the game is seaserpent armor, by the by. Seaserpents are vicious beasts, though! So be wary!   Battletowers are the best way to get loot quickly, so if you defeat the golem up top everything will breakdown.   NETHER IS NOT WORTH IT IN MY OPINION. JUST DEATH THERE.   final quick tips!  Enchant, enchant, enchant!  Dynamic trees can break your fall if you jump on to them!  JEI (just enough items) can tell you how to craft anything you could possibly want!    I hope this helps y'all! If you even see it!   Have a great day, and don't let rlcraft beat ya down! YOU GOT THIS!

SOUP SACRIFICE
Im laughing. At 3AM. My Mom is in my room. :')
Charlie: But he’s completely fluent in Spanish! *Ahem*...     El Tratado de Versalles fue un tratado de paz que se firmó en dicha ciudad al final de la Primera Guerra Mundial por más de cincuenta países.1​ Este tratado terminó oficialmente con el estado de guerra entre la Alemania del segundo Reich y los Aliados de la Primera Guerra Mundial. Fue firmado el 28 de junio de 1919 en la Galería de los Espejos del palacio de Versalles, exactamente cinco años después del atentado de Sarajevo en el que fue asesinado el archiduque Francisco Fernando, (en alemán: Franz Ferdinand) la principal causa de la Primera Guerra Mundial. A pesar de que el armisticio fue firmado meses antes (11 de noviembre de 1918) para poner fin a las hostilidades en el campo de batalla, se necesitaron seis meses de negociaciones en la Conferencia de Paz de París para concluir el tratado de paz. El Tratado de Versalles entró en vigor el 10 de enero de 1920.

My brother is a year older than tommyinnit he thinks his videos are cringe but he respects tommy for coming this far or other stuff
Nobody nobody at all:    Tommy : his name was fuck world now he is dead I don’t have enough skill to eat this bread
hmm.maybe terraria
this mod is the reason i started watching tommy so when i saw the title i knew what it was, because it’s the same as boffy title
Who remembers when Tommy played this 3 years ago?
get in a call with the krew (itsfunneh) to learn how to play RLcraft
I’m subscribed yeeeee tommyyyy
Oh tommyinnit plays Zelda? Poggers
6:17  god hates you all
I wish I can double subscribe to you  Or just infinite :)
does anyone know the music that was playing at around 28 mins?
Huh, maybe Tommy is worthy of playing ark on high difficulty now
Wait Tommy I thought you didn't like anime why did you play JoJo music at the beginning that anime
Did anyone else cry during fuck world's funeral then start laughing when they said "fuck world man"😂
Charlie Slimecicle’s smile at the end had me dying! 🤣
I think 7:37 is the most genuine scream of fear I have ever heard from Schlatt.
PLZ MORE =]
I cant get over the fact that the start of the video has the jojo bizarre adventrues intro
I bet you have a bwc
wats with giorno theme
17:16 Tommy sounded like a chicken.....
Playing jojo music at the beginning = a like
I think this one might be my favorite mod video :D
What is the intro song
And people wonder why today's kids are useless this is what they spend majority of their childhood and teenage years doing 🤣😂
Mod name?
NEW INTRO LOVE IT
23:16 hahahah ajajjajajja hahahhah HAHAHAH JAJAJJAJAJAJAJAJ
Almost 10mil!
Everyone like this video and then refresh your computer so it gets more veiws I want to see this again
L
pmg ;esbian
when tommy says he “survives” a mod he’s died in the video at least 10 times
Ima go have some fun 🙃
CHOMMY it's a MODPACK not a MOD GOD UGGGH SMH MY HEAD
This was one of the best videos on tommys channel omfg
Tommy:Bcuz, We Did Not!! Me: "Heard From Background"
The fact Schlatt started to caress his cat and held it close is just so pure and sad, he realized how much he’ll miss the cat
Lets get tommy to 10mil
Anyone noticed the destiny 2 music at 17:10
jojo lol
i just follow on twich
SCHLATT PRAYING TO THE POPE💀 6:37
💞If you are reading this:💕💕💕💞BE BLESSED!!!   x   1,000,000 !!!!💞💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Tommy I’m not joking I literally made a YouTube account just to sub to you!
Slimecicle: Explaining how to survive Tommy: *schall I've got a knife*
Schlatt really just Looked at the Pope when he Got Struck by Lightning huh-
No YouTube keeps unlikeing videos not unsubscribe
RIP fuckworld
21:57 kk
Im sorry but that music at the beginning just reminds me of that meme with the girl doing her makeup and there’s and earthquake. No?
Schlatt: *Gets smited by God* Slime: *Panic noises* Me: *Dying of laughter*
I used to think the whole unsubscribe thing was Judy a tactic to get people to subscribe, until I checked and was literally unsubscribed
The funny thing is Charlie has tried rl craft before and it has traumatised him
Remember when he played this with boffy?
Please play it again
17:00 that destiny 2 music
Stop using the jojo pt5 music if u don't watch it that's just cringe
ew that mic
the battletower golem was like a dark souls
Hold up. Tommy just said “...you can always unsubscribe.” This is the first time I have ever heard this from a YouTuber.
6:19
Your content always makes me laugh! Can you make some more videos with Drista? ✨
RIP FUCK WORLD ⚰️
i CRIED when the wolf died...
Yo he play gironos theme
HEY SCHLATT WOMEN GOOD ME WOMEN I WOMEN
3:51 Schlatt buddy- WHY 😀
Fuckword really did say fuck the world
I like how jshlatt casually tries to sacrifice his cat and has a religious mental breakdown in the middle of the video.
Oml schlatt's cat was like, "tf hooman?"
No Tommy. You didn’t survived.
“his name is fuck world and he is dead” schlatt starts crying “i don’t have enough skill to eat this bread”
:D I fell through the floor
congrats on #9 on trending
Squeak
“his name is fuck world and he is dead” schlatt starts crying “i don’t have enough skill to eat this bread”
Schlatt straight up said a prayer and offered a sacrifice because of the rng in a java script block game with a slime and a child. This is the best timeline
17:53 to hear fuckworlds song 😭
The best part was ,it wasent even the final boss
i know a harder thing tho yours isnt that hard..
the JOJO music is the best
survived?
Is this... a jojo reference?
the boss looks kinda sus
I see that Tommy finally learned that putting in Gorino's Theme in his intro would be good for his views
24:39 he screamed like a girl and frankly It was slightly adorable
6:40 🤣🤣🤣
23:48 lol the noises he made
do it againb
Hello everyone.  I do sculpting.  nice to meet you
“Am i having a heart attack-“  *intense flashbacks*

This entire vide charlie is just having flashbacks
6:20 Slimecicle did not meet the requirements to speak
tommyinit is unfunny and annoying
9 mil subs for this? Is he supposed to be funny or something?
"Do you really want to respawn? Think about it..."
Remember when he did this with boffy
Tommy has lots of wife
Lol
*dont let this video distract you from the fact that Mr. Krabs sold spongebobs soul for 62 cents*
THIS IS LITTERARLY THE BEST BUNCH OF PEOPLE 🤣
DESTINY 2 MUSIC AT 17:10 WOO

Schlatt sounds like a cave dweller when he screams
I wanna see them make this a series

The dungeon boss able to be defeated with a fishing pole and any kind of bow or getting slapped ;
me whos played rl craft hardcore for 4 years,  watching this made me cry
Wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
two things  1 rlcraft is a modpack not a mod 2 play crazy craft 4.0 and then you will play minecraft's most difficult mod or just play rlcraft and remove just enough items

HOW WAS I NOT SUBBED!?
I just realized this video is 30 minutes long. Guess all be here for a while
17:10 "R.I.P The Other One" lol
Only real men cried when you know who  died
IS NO ONE GONNA NOTICE WHEN WESTONS SONG STARTED PLAYING IN THE BACKROUND??   time stamp: 8:06
Tommy played this with boggy and he doesn’t remember anything :(
You might not be smart enough to eat the bread..  But you dont need to be smart to subscribe to tommyinnit. CLICK THE RED BUTTON NOW!!!!  do it
Do it again!!
Oh so now the music in the beginning is a jojo reference REALLY
I tried this. Death happened. Alot.

let’s enjoy this they took 30 minutes to survive....
Okay now survival series

No kidding why tommy was late on these videos.
Why was Charlie acting like Philza

17:07 if anyone else recognises the music ur a GOAT
JOJO!!!!!!!
Glad to see Tommy is adding hat in time music
WHEN THE TREE SQUISHED CHARLIE I WAS FUCKING DYING
I love that Charlie at the start of the video is already really cautious because he’s done this before

I wish Phill was in this.
Giorno theme intensifies

Warning. Do not eat during this video, you will choke from laughing to hard, I tried it and almost died. Stay safe. :)  /j
the amount of ads in this video made me want to cry
Tommy, It's a MODPACK, not a MOD, MOD is singular
Pls hire the old editor
BAHAHA THE JOJO’S BIZARRE ADVENTURE INTRO LMAO
mans got a shank
Schlatt: *gets struck by lightening*  Slimecicle:  um- I dont think god was very happy with something we said  Schlatt: *turns around to look at the pope*...*turns back around*,*starts praying and offering jcat to god*

“But he’s fluent in Spanish”   El Tratado de Versalles fue un tratado de paz que se firmó en dicha ciudad al final de la Primera Guerra Mundial por más de cincuenta países.1​ Este tratado terminó oficialmente con el estado de guerra entre la Alemania del segundo Reich y los Aliados de la Primera Guerra Mundial.

Ah I see Tommy’s a JOJO fan
Tommy: I dont meet the requirments to eat this bread Everyone else: HOW Me: you ever heard of a gluten alergy...
is it just me or does it seem that Tommys like- idk how to explain it.. like he’s changed his laugh? after he reacted to the SAD-ist bloopers animation and pointed out how he realized his laugh sounded-? idk maybe it’s just me tbh
I play rlcraft (rlcraft is what there playing) and when i died it said "rlcraft is kinda a bitch huh"
I like how he gave up on bleeping the words a minute into the video
It’s dangerous drinking water and watching this at the same time
I subscribed never watched you before I just subscribe
Giornos theme just hits different at the start
rip fuckworld 😔
IF YOU LIKE RLCRAFT CONTENT GO TO FORGE  LABS HE DOES IT A LOT
LMAOOO
It would be cool if he did this again  I subbed :)
Tell dream to invite meeeeee.

Just shoot the boss before stepping foot on the tower and he flies away
WHY AM I HEARING GIORNOS THEME?!
I remember slime did this
2:11 Charlie was right... RIP Fuckworld
People actually find this dude funny?
Schlatt  Literally almost killed me I was eating my chicken and I almost choked
Rip fuckworld
6:18
thhe hardest mod is the friends we made along the way 🥺😩💚
I wanna see him play with the parasites mod.   Probably start screaming immediatley.
Can I know the name of the song in the intro
There is a configuration that is not known as much that is harder
JOJO!!!!!!!!!
one of the best things about these videos is the captions! its so helpful because a lot of the time the auto-generated CCs aren't as accurate 🥺💕
OMG you almost at 10k in like 2 or 1 years
Now I’m not an expert, but “survived” means didn’t die. That is the complete opposite of this video
Everyone: in the middle of a crisis Schlatt: I got dogs! :D
We were watching try not to laugh in math class today and this video popped up and I SCREAMED SO LOUD, "TOMMYINNIT!" AND MY CLASS JUST LOOKED AT ME LIKE I WAS DUMB AND ONE EVEN SAID, "Who is that?" and I said ON GOD "You're so uneducated child."
i love this trio
Listen to the music tommyinnit makes.... no innocence there!
*clears throat* is that song in the intro... A JOJO REFERENCE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
https://youtu.be/4WlIAlLT3VY
THE BIG 10 MILLION!!!!
Wolf armor is my new favorite thing
Wilbur?
he laughs in the thumbnail even through the toughest of times.
Your the best and funniest person ever
Crap like this trending shows me how far humanity has been dumbed down
Me first clicking the video :\ Me when I hear Jojo music :》
"rip the other one"
Tommy:we have to try to survive  Also Tommy:"dies 10 times"
I think the hardest part of this was not trying to laugh at tommy cutting down a tree on slimecicle
Fuck World was an inspiration to all of us and his barks got into the heart of everyone
6:19 This had tears rolling down my face from laughter XDD
That’s not a skeleton with a trumpet that’s a ✨trombone✨
WHY DID JSLAT SACRAFICE SOUP
I know this world by heart after watching forge labs lol
Schlatt: am I having a heart attack?  Dream smp lore from a while back: _you called?_
Fuckworld will be missed...
I enjoy watching
YES I HAVE BEEN WAITING
I remember that old video about boffy and tommy playing RL craft
HAHA THE SAD HALO MUSIC
FUCKWORLD
u gotta do the keyboard video that u did whit glarses
Hearing Giorno's theme reminds me of Slimecicle's comment on one video: "He's beginning to believe..."
ive gotten do dimonds in rl craft
I like the music of the begin, ¿what is it?
#tommytotenmil
All real tommyinnit fans know he did this with boffy....

don't mind my mum's profile pichre but nooooooooo fuckworld
Tommy acting like he didn’t play this same game with boffy a year ago: nO I dIDn’T 😏
Schlatt offering his cat to the papa is sending me-
WHEN HE STARTED PRAYING BAHAHAGGAGHAHAGa
Giornos theme worked well for the first few seconds lol

Tommy: NO WEEBS IN CHAT!  Also Tommy: I’m going to play the JoJo’s Bizarre adventure theme song
no one:  slimesicle: **inaudible**
Only the real ones remember RL craft
"ITS A CHUPACABRAAAAA" me knowing what it is: *whEEzE*
Am I the only one who noticed the destiny 2 music at 17:08?

Battle tower is so ez to destroy but 3 funny noobs defeat the battle tower that's progression right there
Schlatt: “my left arm is damaged does that mean I’m having a heart attack” My: no that *ALREADY HAPPENED*
this was the funniest video i’ve seen in so long
Can you make more?
What's this mod called?
Tommy's rap is so cool, really
I am mad at Tommy, he cut Destiny 2 - ‘Journey’ off half way through, Destiny 2 is like my favourite game ost
why am i hearing boss music
Can we see more rlcraft on the tommyintit channel?
The music lol
Wrong. The hardest mod is every mod.
My best friend recommended me this channel..... I have no regrets Tommy is funny asf
hi Strong TI
Jschlatt not worrying about pressure plates Pressure plates: I’m about to end this mans whole career
Let's all take a moment to know that tommy likes killing women and loves them at the same time
you make my day. Thank you :)
I love your acsent
*sees intro* PAT AND JEN YOU HAVE DECENDANTS!!!
oh I see you watch jojo
Tommy: I’m gonna freeze to death! George: i’m already 10 steps ahead of you
Tommy and charlie : getting attacked by zombies and kidnapped by birds  Schlatt : "im still trapped in the wall guys-"
I loved that anime voice camp reference about the dog speaking spanish
Uma bosta
Alternate title: schlatt and slime being really funny while Tommy complete skips over there jokes
Tommy needs to do a jojo pose
how old  are your viewers? 6?
if schlatt had just respawned right after he fell into the lava i think his dogs would still be alive ;-;
#1 on trending
SCHLATT HAD SOUP
I lost it when I saw the Pope
"The other one" LOL 😝
I love the JoJo music at the start
I played this mod on tlauncher
Why does Charlie sound like Eminim
"hey there betifu- you dont have a face *walks away awkwardly*"-tommyinnit
“i fell through the floor. :).”
Hell yes please do an rlcraft series, I’d pay good money for that
We will always remember fuck world and the other one.
Tommy got above BTS on trending 👏👏👏👏big applause
My favorite trio tbh
Oo
I got flashbacks to the slimecicle video
Tommy: Look at my pet he's wriggly and I named him bumbleb OHHHH
"Oooh, it's comin' down!" -Charlie Slimecicle's  Famous Last Words
@fundy is probably crying right now
SCHLATT SPRINTING???
Ok but when is charlie and Tommy dropping a album
you need skill to eat breed wow.
I don’t know if “survived” is the best word.
"All of my body is broken" "You'll get better"
ANIME SONG YAYAYAYAY JOJOS BIZARRE THEME
:()
I would count how many times they said fuck but it's so many that I can't even bother to.
Schlatt: my left arm is damaged, am i having a heart attack?    Fukin nice
JOJO
That looks REALLY hard
0:09 pretty sure that's 2 goals
How is no one talking about how good Tommys rapping was! Hes just a child and he can rap that good!?!??!
the fart 7
They should have played this with Union
I’d love for this to be a series
Please make this a series
"His name was Fuckworld, now he's dead. I don't have enough skill to eat this bread" *I'M CRYING😂😂😂*
Guys I have a new favourite band
Man's really thought he could say the peanut butter rap from community without us noticing... 19:29
1:25 Greatest hits😌
😔 Anyone remember “WE ARE SO CLOSE TO 2 MILLION”
I really enjoyed this video I would like to see pt.2
i love rlcraft
MAKE THIS A SERIES.
the pressure plates came back to get Schlatt...
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
Yesss, do more of RLCraft cuz you make it too funny XD
This is the most hilarious video i ever seen from Tommyinnit
https://youtu.be/EfRpfb9dM0Y
Fuck world...
500k likes..
Nah there exist harder mods than rlcraft but i get why: clickbait
tommys intelligence level in the game is the same in real life
why do i hear jojo Bizzare adventure boss music
"beat rlcraft"
if jschlatt would have spawned thedogs would have survived 🙄🖐🏻
I like jojo songs tommy
Schlatt when he playing with grian “I’m all family friendly “  When he is with Tommy” ya fuckin dumbass”
Tomothy inside it
"thats my posture" damn i really felt that one
Why was Tommy so much louder than everyone else...
https://youtu.be/IUKH2iBqnYs..
No, fuckworld
xdfwref
7:50 that scream lmao
Schlatt: Am I having a heart attack? Me: Out of all people, you should know, you have experience😂
''I'm pretty sure god was affronted by something we said''   Schlatt: stares Pope
Fuckworld’s death has Grizzly beyond the grave laughing at Schlatt making him kill the wolves lmao
sad I could only appreciate fockworld after he passed...
Look at 2:04 then look at 16:25
The quirky shirt advantageously book because babies ethnopharmacologically doubt midst a abortive brandy. grumpy, repulsive toast
*fuck world and the other one dies* destiny 2 sad music:
Jo...jo?
3:50 that sounds really weird
24:14  tommy: the child slimecicle: the mom
*b o r n t o d i e*
Wassup tommybichit or tommyfuckit
I go for a week and your AT 9 MILLION when I left you were at 7 million
Get mih to 10m
Why is 'follow @ElppaYT' as a death message?
FINALLY A JOJO U TUBER
o7 fuckworld😔🛐
out of everything a can do on my free time i chose to watch this instead of wanting to socialize (but this is way better XD)
I should not have watched this in school
Get him to 10 million
amogus
only people remember when tommy is not even 50k sub
When Tommy hits ten million we should have him take everyone in his phone and rename them as their canonical names. He can just prank call all of his friends and call them like Ghostbur or BIG LAW, and I really just want to see him WAP (worship and prayer) to the crowfather. He just calls Phil and kneels in the presence of him 😂😂😂😂 Phil would lose his shit laughing!
Tommy=Giorno? I mean he used Giornos theme and he also has blonde hair so...
Was it STUPIDLY FUNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?
he might actually beat minimeter
does he not know the fishing rod trick
Fun fact: This is tommy's 250th video
What sounds better, Gayshlatt, or BadBoyGaylo?
The poor cornet singly settle because cost meteorologically license with a spicy prison. unnatural, mushy refund
I have women
18:07 I recognize that music, it’s destiny!!
I swear to god, he did not play Journey for his video, that song stays in Destiny 2!
When Slimecicle died the message said “you do not meet the requirements to live” this became funny since they didn’t have the requirements for like anything
Is that hit rapper and artist FuckWorld? FuckWorld I’m such a fan
rip boffy lmao
Giorno theme hits hard lol
I know that Mod! Bruh
his name was fuckworld, now he is dead i don't have enough skill to eat this bread.
when they were fighting that baby zombie at the start i would have guessed them yelling "WE NEED TECHNOBLADE, WERES TECHNOBLADE
🅥︎🅔︎🅡︎🅨︎ 🅜︎🅤︎🅒︎🅗︎
I bet I'm better at rlcraft than all of you combined.
17:08 yoooo D2 music
Make an smp from this
#1 on most popular games in Sweden, why
😂😂
What part are you on :)
6:53 NOT THE CAT
Tommy play omori plz it's a fun game
8:58 real ones get the reference omg LMAO
9 MILLION!!!
YEEEES!!! JoJo music is here.
“It’s looking at me and it hurts!!”
People who play hardcore in this mod together: pathetic
I can't believe someone put Georgenotfound only fans song into this video. (If your wondering what that song is it's the song that goes: I just spoke to tommyinnit he said, "give me a godamn minute.")
R.I.P fuckworld
Ohhh really too Crazy dud
14:02 captions be like
HOLY SHIT that was EPIC
100 days in minecraft's harder mode
The bowsers fury music worked perfect for that boss fught
*charlie and tommy struggling*   jschlatt: hey guys i feel thro the floor
PLEASE MAKE THIS A SERIES
If you do do it I will  give you a prize
I have never laughed and cried so much in my life 😂
Bruh this dude called the rlcraft *modpack* a mod
um, thats a battle tower
This was funny and confusing at the same time....
makes a series with dream, jorge and sapnap and jsl (I can't write his name)
I’ve never seen Schlatt so terrified before 😂
The new keyboard sounds amazing man. you gotta love glarses for this one.
real og´s will rembember when he did a series with boffy of rlcraft
Jschlatt 2021: "I fell through the floor" Charlie 2021:  "I want to be unborn" Tommy 2021: "LET ME IN THE F****** WALL"
And can someone tell me why this was on my recommended page?
Is that a Jojo reference?
I love the use of the song journey
Congrats
Rip fuckworld, forever in our hearts o7
r.i.p fuckworld
boffy?
Dude the Destiny 2 music when the dogs died really hit hard
the editing seems off for some reason WHATT
ZE JOJO THEME!!!!!
When the video doesn’t have techno
Love the Jojo music
7:37 and 7:50   When someone looks at SCP-096
From 16:27 to 17:52, Everyone should try not to laugh and cry about F***world and The Other One’s deaths. Yes, I’ve set up a try not to laugh challenge on this comment.
jojo 🎼🎼🎼lol
my mom walks in: jschlatt: NOOOOOO FUCKWORLD
This was legitimately genuine petrified chaos to the death for them. 0_0  Also.... 15:35 Woooo!!! Baccano music!!! Let's go!!!!
I love how Charlie's just having ptsd in this one
O didn't know tommy knows the legend of zelda🙂
Since no ones gonna say it..  hat in time OST😌
3:18  “what the fuck is that” I literally spit my drink out my nose
You know it’s serious when the jojo music comes on
Been here since 20k man love your vids! Keep doing what you do best, making videos for us!
IS THAT A GIORNO THEME I HEAR MM
Is that Journey at 17:34, no wayyyyyuu
idk if this works but pin me if u get tricked  ... Read more
He is a god
Schlatt enters the village without a dragon:    me: **what the hell?**
Fuck world as the greatest men have said
i have watched this video more then 10 times and it never gets old
Slimecicle is getting flashbacks to his rlcraft video-
Tommy is kind a beast
The only person that hates tommy is that vegan teacher
i love how when schlatt started praying after getting struck by lightning lol
At 6:21 Charlie's random cry is subtitled Wojcicki, which is the last name of the CEO of Youtube.  Coincidence? I think not.
Schlatt: *Crying* Me: *Laughing*
Awesome
sooo funy bro
Jschalt saying he fell through the floor and keeps saying  *slimcile and Tommy fighting mobs and now paying attendtion* it’s too funny
I played the funniest hardest mod
Hey tommy can u do more dream smp videos. Plz reply
Charlie has PTSD from the last time he played RLcraft
Me: seeing tommy use jojo gold wind Also me: a jojo fan “A man of culture i see”
I bet Tommy is gonna have more subscribers than dream in a couple of months. We shall wait for the day
قناتك زق مو حلوه ابشع قناة في العالم
This is so *hilarious* LMAO
Me: *hears gooergenotfound only fans* Me: *starts sing* My body: 🔼🔼◀️▶️▶️▶️◀️🔼🔼▶️▶️◀️ *Me in my zoom class with my cam on* My teacher saying she’s gonna call my mom
We only had one goal ...  Defeat the Dungeon Boss *and* Survive! Wait ...
10 million soon
I love the spongebob musics
cookieswirlc has more subs than you tommy...........
I Just want to thank God publicly for the things he's doing privately
we all have that same appointment did you know one day the Bible says were all gonna see GOD face to face he will say two things one well done my good and faithful servant meaning you surrendered your life to Christ and trusted in the LORD Jesus Christ and believed what he did on the cross or hes gonna tell you depart me all you workers of lawlessness i never knew you but you dont got to be scared of that appointment the Bible says you can be ready for that Appointment by accepting Jesus as your Saviour he washes and cleanses you and you become a Child Of GOD surrender to Christ and repent and believe in Jesus Christ believe the Gospel Live for Jesus Fear God and his commandments obey GODS word JESUS IS LORD NOT A SWEAR WORD JESUS IS THE SAVIOR NOT THE RELIGION PLEASE GIVE YOUR LIFE TO CHRIST REPENT AND BE BAPTIZED HE IS COMING SOON BELIEVE THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST
I quit RLcraft after one day from raging and raging and raging.
it feels bad being late
I remember when you had 190k  u have grown so much lmao
Tommy did the same vid with boffy a while ago...
This is such an underrated trio
does anyone know the name of the sound used in the starting 32 secs
'I survived Minecraft's hardest mod'  dies 20 times trying to get resources
Tommy raps like a grandpa
Ain’t nobody gonna talk bout the JoJo music at beginning?
schlatt looks like he saw a ghost
Anyone notice that the boss looks like *A M O G U S*
When you realize that Tommy is a jojo fan
Congrats for almost 10 mil. 👌🏻💕💞💓💖💘💝💗❤️🤍😊
My head just went: "JO-JO!"
Tommy ( almost 10 million) what we see 9.14 million ( Sheeeesh SOOO close man)

when tommy is acting like he doesn't know how to play RLcraft, but he played it with Boffy a while back
Anyone else hear the destiny music?
I think the title’s lying
Me: *Reads title* "Pog" Video: "starts" *giornos theme plays*
“Am I having a heart attack?”  Schlatt my dude this is your second time now
For people wanting to know, the mod pack is called RLcraft

This is the best thing that has ever happend
6:40
Charlie:I WANNA BE UNBORN(goes back in his mothers womb)

Tommy: 'fuckworld'
Poor fuckworld
It’s hard but there are harder modpacks
jshlatt in tommyinnit's videos makes them 1000% funnier
Me just being late for every single video   How I feel:(｡ŏ﹏ŏ).·´¯`(>▂<)´¯`·.
This is amazing Tommy’s rap was partly from community so he watched community
I think there’s a video in your adds
Can you play hypixel skyblock there has been so many updates.
Aye tommy, do survival series in RL Craft
"His name was fuckworld and now he's dead, I don't have enough skill to eat this bread." I literally drooled I was laughing so hard
when you realise tommy is 17 that means he will live more then all the 20+ year old guys so you can watch him as much as u want
Schlatt went to the backrooms
Well this was hilarious
https://youtu.be/27n5pIw-EOQ
did anyone else keep hearing tommy say shatt instead of schlatt ?
he should really do a series of this
Tommy was so good
“his name is fuck world and he is dead” *schlatt starts crying* “i don’t have enough skill to eat this bread”
Jschlatt: the dog can't speak English.  Slimecicle: he's actually completely fluent in Spanish.
Not the JoJo’s theme
Tommy: I’m gonna freeze to death! George: *i’m already 10 steps ahead of you*
Jschlatt: the dog can’t speak English  Slimecicle: He’s actually completely fluent in Spanish
"hes thinking about some fucked up shit..."  schlatt: *hugging and petting his cat*
Imagine if dream did a speedrunner vs hunters with mods
The fact that Tommy is making a jojo themed intro makes me so happy. TOMMY NEW JOESTAR
Very yrue
@TommyInnit make Merch PLEASE I would buy all of it honestly I LOVE your vids even more than you love that girl from collage
Tommy is a child
he really needs to make a series on rl craft, or an smp
Not gonna lie, this made me laugh so much. Really funny video 😂
What if you said you wanted to go to heave But god said, you’re not smart enough
The sad music is destiny 2 theme
The newest I survived book is bussin  I survived the death of fuckworld
"woah its coming down!" (dead by tree)
That affect with Herobrine and Schlatt was nice
The irony in Jschlatt disregarding pressure plates, and pressure plates causing the death of FuckWorld.
o7 for fuckworld and the other one
I feel shclatt’s pain Like the ppl say “I haven’t seen my user in 3 years  I miss him”
nobody:  me *Vibing to the JoJo music*
6:40 WHAT IS HE DOING
DO MOREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE FOR FUCKWORLD

I hate Tommy i like only his content 😎
20:32   *have a carrot calm yourself*
Jesus is coming back very soon. We must be ready. Believe in the death, burial & resurrection of Christ.  1 John 5:13  These things have I written unto you that BELIEVE on the name of the Son of God; that ye may KNOW that ye have ETERNAL LIFE, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
he tried to defeat the dungeon boss which you beat with a fishing rod -_-

People: *Unsubscribe because they don't have interest in a channel anymore.*  Youtubers "Impossible, has to be a glitch."
Rl craft is crazy 😭
Reamember when he played it with someone else???
He got me with the Pope
Missing when he played rlcraft with boffy before he was big
"Hey guys look at my pet, he wriggly and I named him bumbleb-OOH." -TommyInnit 5:46
The simplistic methane prudently bless because firewall putatively visit next a absorbing periodical. hypnotic, even excellent excited susan
The Battletower Golem is the earlier Among Us character.
How did I come here from Trycs
I loved the entrance
Why did you put dream in prison ???????
Tommy already has 1Mil on his blog channel and hasn’t made a vid on it yet
its called rlcraft nub jk
Bofy
Hey big man tommy. i was wondering if i could play in dream smp for one day. i am 13. I'm YOUNGER than BIG MAN TOMMy please?
jschlatt is afraid of any mob
7:49 that was scary-  and funny
Tommy i want to say that you are absolutely amazing you are funny and really inspiring i love you soooooooo much thank you for posting such amazing content😊😊❤❤stay safe.
*tommy weeb edition?*
This video gave me more anxiety than manhunts do
"I Survived Minecrafts Hardest Mod.."  Also tommy: * dies like 25 times*
Hhh
TommyInnit: I’ve got a shank 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I want this to be a new series, I want more of this mod.
Rip fuckworld will be remembered for the music he made
is it only me or is the into a bit like slimecicle... I love the collab :D
If I played that's mod I'd rather than kill everyone
Schlatt: am I having a heart attack Me: flashbacks of dsmp
I Played This Mod Before is so  hard
Once the destiny music started playing upon settling fuckworld's and the other one's grave, it was all over for me.
"Everybody loves Tommy and his friends! This made my day a lil better! Thx Tommy! If your even reading this.."
The good sampan ganguly care because letter strangely glow in a hurt drop. safe, brave pigeon

Tommy this was one of the funniest videos I have ever seen! Completely made my day x
Do another rl craft vid
How does Schlatt just succeeded at everything when all he does is wander around like a dumbass  /Pos btw
A very good video
Love this Vid so much
The selective water considerably suppose because tomato angiographically branch about a narrow beech. snotty, somber half-brother
Like when you did the prison video
(beat) you ready? Heeere we go, once upon a time not long ago, schlatt was walking like an average schmoe, when he stumbled upon, this old, old shrine, he had to go in, cause there was loot inside! he had a wolf, it was his best, good, friend, and this is how the story has to end,  turns out the old, old, shrine was a trap,  he was ripped and burned of every scrap,  the wolf, sadly, was on a hate less strap,  fell into the lava, the other wolf after that. the swag dog was named 'fuckworld' both of them into the lava they were hurled,  sad it most was, definitely for schlatt, at the end of the day, he kissed his cat. goodnight!
FUCKWORLD NOOOOO
This was my most fav bc I love rlcraft even though it’s hard And I like when you play with Charlie And Jschlatt
SCHLATT HAD A POPE CARDBOARD CUTOUT WHEN HE WAS STRUCK BY LIGHTNING IM CRYINGGG

The hardest part is trying not to laugh while your in the middle of a class.
More RL craft PLEASE
I thought the YouTube unsubscribing glitch was a made up thing by youtubers to get people to subscribe but it's real. I checked and I was actually unsubscribed. Weird.
The narrow dew muhly weigh because dinghy suprisingly identify minus a plausible estimate. calm, woozy format
Congrats on 9m lol 🥰

Top 10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. If at first you don't succeed, destroy all evidence that you tried.  2. I've only been wrong once, and that's when I thought I was wrong.  3. We are born naked, wet and hungry. Then things get worse. 4. IRS: We've got what it takes to take what you have got. 5. I'm out of bed and dressed. What more do you want? 6. I used to think I was indecisive, but now I'm not too sure. 7. It's lonely at the top; but you do eat better. 8. I don't suffer from insanity; I enjoy every minute of it 9. If everything is coming your way, then you're in the wrong lane. 10. It's been Monday all week.            Editorial: Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit NeedGod.com.

Yo, I just wanted to say that, we have all sinned and fallen short of the Glory of God. Jesus died for the forgiveness of sin and rose from the dead proving He had power of sin and death. As long as you repent and truly accept him as your Lord and Saviour you will be Born again (saved); go to heaven🙏❤️   Our sin is breaking Gods law e.g: the 10 commandments. Most of us have all Lied, Stolen something, Looked at a woman with lust(Pornography), used Gods name in vain etc. These are only 4 of the 10 commandments and just one of them separates us from God for eternity since God is Holy and it stops us from entering his kingdom when we die. Anyways Jesus took our punishment, so that we can have eternal life as long as we trust in Jesus for our salvation and not our selves, it’s a gift from God which no man should boast about. Once someone truly trusts in Jesus, they are born again and a completely new person spiritually speaking, and anyone around them will most likely say they see a different person e.g: they do good things now instead of bad. Another benefit but shouldn’t be the focus is freedom from addiction which Is the main reason I’m sending this. Once you are born again God will place in you desires to hate sin and hate porn and equip you with spiritual tools to fight your addiction and conquer it, I’m not gonna lie and say it goes straight away but with work you can once and for all conquer it and never watch it again however the main point is going heaven instead of hell.  How to be saved - Agree with God that we are in need of His help and that we cannot save ourselves. Recognize what Jesus Christ has done in our place and accept the gift that He offers us by trusting in Him alone for salvation. Receive the ability to turn away from our sin and towards God because of His help   Hope you all have a nice day God bless you all and your families❤️; remember Jesus loves you❤️ https://youtu.be/1IhHfc61aJk https://youtu.be/XdlhJiEDqJ8 https://youtu.be/HTs5zQfqbLw

It might seem super dumb but one of the things that I really like about your videos is the subtitles. When people like Techno post a video every lifetime then I want to take in everything that's happening and not miss a word but I don't always understand what he says. Also because the videos are funny.
Me clicks on quackity.... sees Tommy smiling.... (sigh) I know I’ve already seen it but I have too.

To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Imagine your mom gave you a bread and than you said "i dont have enough skill to eat this bread"
20:28 i just lost my soul

Thank you for the laughs! All of you lol
Tommy was spitting bars on the rap pole
Tommy and anyone else reading this, I have something to admit. For the past year Ive been depressed, and suicidal, but just watching your videos Tommy really helps me keep going. Alot of things are happening to me, and not alot of them are good, but when the bad things come, I just watch your streams/videos and it really helps me, so, thank you, and thank you to everyone else.

taming. Much like a garden variety of other mobs in the mod, Rocs can be tamed, and will require you to make avian treats for them before you can do so. In order to try and tame one, you will likely need more than one treat, because these mobs are greedy and will try to kill you at the same time.
POV: you didn’t salute Fuckworld and thr other one.

Jschlatt: am I having a heart attack? *flashbacks*
The sad Destiny 2 music was a nice touch.
terraria be like
Play more of RL craft
Ah yes, Lycanite’s Mobs, the mod whose philosophy is basically “If you see it, run away because it probably wants to kill you.”  The two exceptions that I know of are the pink fairies who will passively give you regeneration and leave you alone, and the blue floating shield golems who are just iron golems and will only attack you if you fuck with the villagers. But don’t let them get too close to each other, or they will turn into a different creature who- of course- wants to kill you!

You survived and died at the same time
Dose anyone know what song he used in the intro?
We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty, and to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.
It might just be me, but I don’t remember this part of Hamilton. (18:35)

Like to let Big Bot tommay to make a series on this

my bday was made on the day this vid came out :D
#1 on trending 💪🏼
at 20:59/30:58 I appear in the video.
Y’all gotta get the others to join this.
When you're a 10 year old, one year is 10% of your entire life. When your 60 years old, one year is 1.7% of your entire life. Human beings are all about perspective, and this is why everything is so dramatic for the youth, and why older people generally handle things more calmly. I call it my percentage/perspective theory.  It's easy to tell a child not to take something so seriously from your older perspective, but you shouldn't forget their younger perspective. If you graduate high school at the age of 18, the last 4 years have been 22% of your entire life. If you graduate high school at the age of 18 you will have spent 67% of your life in school. If you graduate with a bachelor's degree at the age of 22, the last 4 years will have been 18% of your entire life, and you will have spent 73% of your entire life  on education.  If you live to be 70 years old and you look back on your education it will seem as if time flew, as the 16 years you spent getting educated is now only 23% of your entire life.  Life is all about perspective, because perspective is the individuality of man. If you use my percentage/perspective theory you can make a lot of sense of the illusion of time.
finally, tommy be a jojo fans
17:30 destiny music ayyyy
Tommy:theres a trap in the house, oh its for the door xD

<spoilers>    When the destiny 2 ost journey started playing over fuckworld’s death I fucking lost it ;v;
خوباست
Bestie you played this with boffyty
Fuckworld: *dies* Everyone: *sadness* Me: Holy shit that’s Journey form Destiny 2
dude i love how he plays giornos theme every video (do wish it was jotaros theme but oh well )
Me: NOOOOO!!!!! FUCKWORLD!!!!!!             WHY???  Minutes earlier: *Laughing at fuckworlds name*
rlcraft
In the beginning they were scared of a normal zombie baby
HES PLAYING JOJOS THEME
5:47 this made me laugh a lot lol
lol
Who here rembembers the RL Craft vids with Boffy?
I like that Schlatt sacrifices his irl cat but then almost cries about his video game dog
absolutely love this type of video, rlcraft brings back great memories
I think Tommyinitt is not annoying more like funny
cant wait for someone to tell them that you can yet the golem with a fishing rod
havin a poo
On every Tommyinnit Video I am going to say Chommy innit edit: sry I can’t my 800’s phone will not work
I should be used to this but y is Tommy the one who is genuinely serious in these
He did the giorno thing as the intro like slimes videos
girno
It’s funny how Charlie is really scared of RLCraft because he’s done it before
if there was a pokemon movie series this would be the second movie called pokemon II: revenge of the pokemon
“That’s an “S Tier weapon in the United Kingdom”😂
"give him two seconds... one, .." * schlatt dies
The destiny music at fuckworlds death was a touch I really liked as a rampant destiny addict
Jojo musik epiko

ah yes watching 3 boys suffer sure does feel good
Does this guy make anyone else mad?
I like how Tommy thanks us for subscribing :>
6:17 WAIT IS THAT A HAT IN TIME MUSIC!?.... **intense flashbacks**
I will take a bullet dream smp sucks
A pero que bonito es ver a un niño de 16 jugar contra entidades que pueden desmaterializar la realidad, que bonito
Tommy using Giorno's theme remix as the title theme is just... I don't know anymore.
These guy’s struggling to defeat a tower boss Forge Labs: Amateurs
Is the background music a cuphead song😅
charlie: I'm pretty sure god was affronted by something we said! Schlatt: *looks over at pope*
I completely forgot about the fact that Charlie has played RLcraft before and the way he talks in the video shows his PTSD.
so um I have a question does tommyinnit like anime or does he hate anime
fuck world is a legend and will never be forgotten.
Do you remember when humans have to upgrade thier mouth to eat a cake?
You guys should get forge labs to do this video with you
HOLY SHIT ITS #1 ON TRENDING OMFG
If you don't have the intelligence to eat bread or cake............ Then stay single
Schlatt looks so traumatised
please more of these videos
*Modpack*
This reminds me of PopularMMOs modded let’s plays I forgot what they’re called

I like how the dogs die then destiny music starts playing noice
#1 TRENDING!!!
FUCK WORLD!!!!!!!!!

your mic is too loud compared to schlatt and charlie
the beggining kinda funny bc he played rlcraft with boffy--
THE JOJO MUSIC AHAHAGAH
Who is here from glarses
Jschlatt looking at Pope Francis behind him is just absolute gold
Brooooo your subs gain so fast!
Rest In Peace to the best dog, fuckworld
11:12 tommy the bow is massive because it was called a ''Longbow'' used by many Europeans in the Medieval times and were mostly used by the British or the English archers. It was used for warfare and it was used by the English/British to colonize more territory and also piss the hell off the other European Monarchies.
Do more
Rip fuckworld...
Dang tommy #1 on trending I see you
I would love any form of series where you three play thia
6:21 i see what you did there
Omg the JoJo music in the beginning  👌
Fun fact the word fuck was said 116 times in this video
the intro was epic
Woah tommy so close to 10 mil now grats mate
Tommyinnit: the only goal is to defeat the dungeon boss   People that creates videos about rlcraft 100 days survival:  HAHAHA FISHING ROD GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!
Anyone hear the jjba music
Casually clicks on a tommyinnit video: *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Opening comes on*
This mod was on one life y'all aren't as good as the ogs I guess

Yooo that’s jojo music 😂😂
Not me remembering when you played this a while back with boffy🤣 the good old days
man anyone remember when tommy did this with boffy?
Holy moly I remember briefly playing this mod when I was like 12, the nostalgia hits real. One of the best mods I’ve ever experienced!
What’s with a bunch of comments spamming different YouTube links
jojo
How can you not cry when a man lost something Precious to him his f*ckworld    *F*ckworld Rest in peace 2021-2021*
You know it's bad when even jschlatt is screaming in terror
DID ANYONE ELSE HERE THE JOJO OP IN THE START OF THE VID
i love rlcraft so much
This was such a great video like holy shit it had me dying
How in the nether is tommyinnit #1 on trending
Mod nameee?/':'6'6"6:6"5"5'???
What about Boffy?
Didn’t exactly “survive”
did schlatt actually cry when fvckworld died
Charlie's smile when he died in the tower explosion was genuinely unnerving
this reminds me of hexxit, except phil and schlatt didn't have that much trouble
To everyone who's reading this comment: God bless your life!
GET THIS MAN TOO 10 MIL SUBS
im living on benefits, they call me taina naina, hot tits, get me nails done evey week, hair extensions on the cheap, i know this scam that scam

glarses tommyinnit collab when.
17:11 Journey from the Destiny 2 OST starts playing
“there’s blood all over my screen.” “i’m sure it’ll be fine.” “a-all of my body is broken.” “you’ll get better.”  teachers when you tell them you’re not feeling good:
That music though at the start of the video
I want a compilation of how many time they said Fuck in this video 😂
#1 ON TRENDING!!!
I can only imagine the flashbacks schlatt must be having back to his time with Phil when fighting the golem.
1:32 that gasp though
What’s the name of the mod?
Its not hardest mod Ever I dare u play terra firma craft
Tommyinit is close to impress the girl in his collage
#1 ON TRENDING YOOOOO
No one: Jschlatt: Sacrifices Jambo Me: “NO NOT JAMBO!”
Lol the thing that spawned when u slept was a reaper they have a chance of spawning when u sleep btw he was right no where is safe in rl craft one moment ur fine next there's a dam dragon burning and setting ur house on fire 🔥 it's rough in that but it's real fun I love it.
Congrats on 9mil, but y doesn’t techno have that many?
Tommy my friend is being you
R.I.P fuckworld...  Guess it wasnt only his songs that were fire...
This man was on 9.1 mil yesterday now hes on 9.12???
This would be a really fun series
With debug commands!  Edit: Not Really :)
Schlatt: Am I having a heart attack!?? [FLASHBACKS TO THE DRUG VAN]
I love this mod sometimes... Tommy can we get a series of this maybe possibly 🥺
Tommy the swordsmen Slimciccl the archer Schlatt the tamer
Everyone:sad about the dogs  Me: laughing for no reason
SCHLATT RECITING THE PRAYER WAS SO FUNNY LMFAO
I remember the series of rlcraft that he did with boffy
17:42 the destiny music
Giorno theme is back @Rudylmao don't tell Tommy what it is from
Schlatt: *Takes horn* Also Schlatt: I’m gonna have some fun with this!
I showd my brother the jojo theme and he said *ah yes from tommyinnit* ;_;
During the moment where fuckworld died, music from destiny 2 started playing and had me crying for much different reasons then the death of fuckworld
I can imagine schlatts neighbors hearing a middle age man mourning over “fuckworld”
Jojo music and Jschlatt in Tommy’s video:❤️❤️❤️ / No jojo music and no Jschlatt : 💔💔💔💔
How is this #1 on trending?
The people n e e d more RLCRAFT
I really hope this becomes a series
tommyinnit congrates 9M sub!!! cant wait u getting 10M !
Bro journey is such a good song
This SAO episode was great
Tommy’s last words: AAAAAAAAAAAAA
Me: *goes to the doctor* Doctor: So what's happening? Me: Am in depression... Doctor: than watch tommyinnit.
You are gonna beat miniminter to ten mill
Slimeicle's RLcraft PTSD kicked in
18:52  look it's budget the battle of yorktown
Common misconception: RL Craft is not the “Hardest mod” ever, once you have a bit of knowledge about it it’s really easy and there’s a lot of modpacks out there that are way harder PS: After playing it a lot it’s honestly more the most annoying modpack instead of the hardest
RIP fuckworld
ha! they are recreating the first time tommy played RLCRAFT with boffy
Tommy keep adding the jojo theme music for your intros
https://youtu.be/L-gUdV4HzS4
Tommy should shave his head if he gets 15 mil
This was super cool. I wish Tommy would make this a series.
They are doing everything besides plating the mod correctly and that's amazing
You should totally play more RL craft
DAMN TOMMY IS #1 ON TRENDING
rest in peace fuckworld he was the realest rapper in the game man
A tommy vid with slimecicle starting with vente d'oro is the closest we will get to a slimecicle main channel upload
Schlat every single sec: I'M DEAD
I know u are not gonna see this but u are growing fast hahaha congrats :))
You know it's gonna be a good video when they play Giorno's theme in the intro👀
You tube is not unsubscribeing me my dad is :(
Jshlat looks like somebody in the mafia

I really liked this video because there was a different objective while the other videos everyone does bits and forces it to be funny (nothing wrong with that) while in this it’s more real and it’s still funny
*hey there beautif- oh you don’t have a face.* (my new ringtone)

I like how the golem is already difficult to defeat, then theres the way more powerful beings and bosses in the game
boffy is punching the air rn
The four stages of fear Schlatt: *screaming* Schlatt:*sleeps* Schlatt:*thinks he's fine* Schlatt:*starts screaming again*  This is all happening while Charlie is discussing how he's going to die.
6:30 the way schlatt looked at the cardboard cutout of the pope after dying to lighting 😂
I can make the mod harder I have a mod pack where everything tries to kill you
tommyinnit are u a jojo's fan?

The dungeon boss is one of the easiest boss to beat when I start
[4:38]  Charlie: IT’S COMING DOWN!  and so is his life..
Maybe for a future video you can put all of your Mods together and see if you can try not to break the game
Tommy now uses Giorno's theme after seeing how well it does for Charlie's videos
But can dream…..
He’s a Dogecoin Millionaire --> spotify
Even though I'm an American woman I've been here since 3mil subs :D
THE JOJO MUSIC AT THE BEGINNING LDJSJDHSJDJ
Ssundee s blood and bones series: am i a joke to you
I love how they were all genuinely worried about Fuckworld
"please enjoy this video. BECAUSE WE DID NOT" thanks for what I'll say in my future vids tommy.
what mod is this
Jesus loves you and He died for your sins and on the third day raised from the dead to defeat sin and death also because of  His love grace and mercy is so great He is willing to forgive you Also it's either paying for your own sin (hell) or accepting Jesus' payment for you fr. Which do you choose?
Hey step charlie im stuck on the wall
Tommy inside the egg in the Dream SMP is crying obsidian tubbo and ranboo opened it
People thinking dragons are hard to kill while there's a boss that takes 10 minutes to kill with strength level 255 and the strongest sword on the modpack lol
I swear his face on his thumbnails get more and more Asian the more he makes videos      Edit: I dare you to say I’m racist

Is *nobody* going to talk about the JoJo music in the beginning
Damn Tommy got really far. I remember when he had 4m time has gone by quick
Alternate title for video: "We didn't survive in RL craft"
wow it coming down.....*Dies*
Shlatt: “Am I having a heart attack?”    Well... This is oddly familiar to something but I can't quite put my finger on it.
Just me or I heard A Hat In Time music?
"I don't have enough skill to eat this bread" I died
Plays Jojo theme on the start of the video
Tommys must be making fucking bank off of this video cause holy shit, I don't think I've ever had so many damn ads in the span of 30 minutes than I did today
thats a lv 3 tower that not even near to the hardest boss
FINALLY HE DOSE THIS
What’s funny is that he played rlcraft a year ago with Boffy
I love how you tubers spend years to get to 10 Mill and tommy takes a couple of months 🤣
rest easy fuckworld you will be missed :[
i remember tommy’s and boffys collab doing RLcraft
Shlatt: why are there church bells ringing? Tommy: finally, the harvest can commence!
Can we just enjoy the fact that they used the track Journey for this video for Fuckworld's death
Never have the words “I’m gonna go have some fun” terrified me more
Idk why
I hate tommyinnt
already a like for the intro music
Schlatt: cares about f*ck world   That other dog: Am I a joke to you?
Who said white boys cant rap Lmao

YO #1 ON TRENDING CONGRATS
Rlcraft is the hardest mod it has lots of mods to make it harder like hard bosses strong mobs like dragons and more monsters more items and more structures defeat them and loot their chest or if you want to defeat them you have to be stronger and tame dragons from ice and fire ride theme and kill the mobs with your dragon but first find a dragon defeat mother's dragon get a dragon egg hatch it when fire burn it with flint and steel or ice wait when it rains defeat all bosses get more armor more weapons and loot YOU HAVE TO DEFEAT THEM ITS POSSIBLE TO DEFEAT
omg i wanna try this mod/modpack with one of my friends
did anyone else realise tommys fuckworld rap sounded suspiciously like the deans peanut bar rap from community
This brought back so much nostalgia from watching the little club
SHEESH
6:20 wojcicki?
this actually made me laugh out loud for the first time in a while...
Bro what about that time you played this with Boffy lmao
FUCKWORLD NO 😭😭😭

I'm guessing this is rl craft. You bring it back after all these years
WHY THE FUCK DID YOU NOT DO THIS WITH “BOFFY” BROSKI YOU GUYS ALREADY DID COLAB WITH THIS MOD
Number 1 trending world wide
The Jojo goes hard
*if you think of it. Jschlatt killed fuckworld by not respawning. The first dog that died wasn’t fuckworld because it didn’t have armor so it died faster. If schlatt had respawned fuckworld would’ve teleported back to him at safety.*
That imma fix wolves joke was ... wow...10/10
Am I the only one who didn't give a shit about what he was saying at the start but was giving with the intro music
That’s a mod pack, not a mod
"I killed a skeleton and other just became the undead!" isn't skeletons already the undead?
Please do this again it looks so fun

Mr. TommyInnit. I am begging you to do a 100 days series with Charlie, Wilbur, Philza, and Schlatt. PLSSSSSSSSSSS
Didn’t he play this with boffy?
This NEEDS to be a new series, really brings me back to Tommy and Boffy's rlcraft series, or even Philza and Schlatt's hexxit one. These three bumbling in a hardcore world is just the funniest thing ever.
I love how Charlie is the expert because of his trauma
isnt this the same mode ssundee used for insane craft

thumbnail: i survived hardest mod  me: i mean he only died 7times so technacly.
Giorno Giovanni
This MOD was poggers, and we got Jambo content
I love the dynamic these three have
Makes a video on the raid race day with journey blasting during the video and acting like a raid team during the tower is the biggest coincidence I’ve ever seen
9.11 subscribers a bit suspicious
Just wanna say... the intro hit hard ngl
RIP FUCKWORLD AYYYYE  /j
You should try a pokemon mod
He's in your bed and i'm in your twitch chat
FOR FUCK WORLD o7

"Dungeon boss"  1st that is not a dungeon it's called a battle tower 2nd it's kinda just a miniboss rather than a boss   Still funny vid
giorna giovanna music
Tommy are you a weeb you have anime music in the background?
So funny
"Hey there beautifu-" "y-you don't have a face"

MORE
LMFAO 🤣
Its a Modpack not a single mod.

Rlcraft is not that hard if you get a good start, and know what to do
Fly high fuckworld and then other one
What’s this song called 0:28
RIP FUCKWORLD
Like the jojo ost at the beginning
Is this a JoJo reference
Tommy:"i dont like anime" the intro music:"do you know who i am"
Why at 0:18 it looked like KSI was missing something lmao     I MEAN KISSSING MY BAD
RLCraft smp sounds nice
I appreciate the excess amount of 3D world music
Tommy: *morales*         Editor larry: its actually *morals*
I love your videos, it’s just that finals are in 3 days and I don’t have 30 minutes to watch it big man😭
Hi Tommy ur my fave yt
16:14 don’t you mean, a trumbone? 🤣🤣🤣
this video is a kind of jojo refrence
3:07 "HOW DID I HEAR A WEREWOLF HOWL? ITS FUCKING FURCON OUT THERE"
Tommy was POPPIN off with the rap though
Schlatt: am I have a fucking heart attack Me: LMAOAOA HE DID NOT
Somebody should make a compilation of every time someone said fuck in this video
Okay that unsubscribing glitch is legit. I was somehow unsubed
I love the part when Charlie and Jschlatt say that they will catch Tommy so they can play forever but they are to far and they fail to catch so now they can never play again... or at least not all the time
you keep using giorno's theme, but did you watch jojo?
tommyinit doesnt like anime... then why would he put the giorno theme or something in his intro? (sorry i dont know much about jojo)
now you have to play the rlcraft modpack
YOOO IM VIBING TO THE OPENING SONG
So you've watched jojos bizarre adventure
jojo's
17:55 Lyrics:  His name was f*ck world now he is dead I don’t have enough skill to eat this bread
6:19 heh, I see what you did there with '(susan) wojcicki' lmao
He survived the mod but died about a hundred times xD. Spot the mistake xD But it was so much fun to watch. Pls do a video like that again. It would be coool
How many cuphead songs do you have?
C'mon, part 2!
tommy acting like he never played rlcraft before
How is called the giorno's theme remix at the intro? Thats sooo good

The Jojo's music at the start:✋🏻😩
schlatt needed to respawn to save fuckworld
the amount of screen recordings I have gotten from this video in 9 minutes is crazy-
They should Dragon fire mod
More RL craft pls :)
How to get likes on comments: *SHWEEEEDABADOOOOOOOOOO*
Killed a woman feeling good   The team hahaha
9.11 subs :eyes:
Someone dies   Charlie slimecicle: that'll happen
Fuckworld said "fuck world" and jumped into lava so these three got sad and said "Fuck world."
This would be a great series
HOW IS MY GUY AT 9.11 MILION!?!?!
This should be a series
you can beat dungeon by using fishing rod
Slimesicles disolves in vinegar bc he is a slime
Is this a JoJo reference?
somebody made the dream smp and made you a zombie an dream a iron golem i made the dream smp into mobs Shadope and i think youre the best youtuber
The video was really fun! The only problem though was that everyone's voice was really low compared to Tommy.
The fact that tommyinnit has started to use mods is very cool. Who knows, maybe we will see him do something with thermal expansion, or better yet, draconic evolution. (this is a request for collaboration)
R.I.P fuckworld Started crying when he died....😢
First time ever schlatt plays any game with a face cam. It just does not feel right.
17:57 this is the best part
out of context, 11:11 - 11:19 sounds wrong 💀
what mod is this
Charlie's last words were "WOW IT COMING  DOWN"
I have been looking for this vid
This is where the drama begins 😽👏
“Cause we can see out there but they can see us here” Ever 60 seconds in africa a minute passes
OMG congrats for 9.11m
The jojo music
is there a duck?!?! 🤣 tommy the duck init 18:27
Hey Tommy you have a video in your ads
I hope this becomes a series
i would absolutely love to see a series of this omg
Jojo music
The vulgar waste unfortunately depend because bomb sadly head with a mundane crib. past, busy bill
Tommy has just become smaller slimecicle and its hilarious
New name: 31 minutes of 3 men screaming FUCK

#2 on trending!
This Is A *B R I’ I S H* Moment
bruh as an rlcraft veteran i feel a deep sense of utter dissapointment in you but you tried so good job
NOBODY SAW THE RECIPE FOR THE LONGSWORD LMAO IT RESEMBLES SOMETHIN
I have a world with that mod
R.I.P. Fuck World, you will be remembered...
the fact that they could have defeated it with just a fishing rod is funny
I never thought I would hear jschlatt use the word drip but here we are.
Can someone pls count the amount of times they died for me
“That’s an S-Tier weapon in the United Kingdom” XD XD
Well Charlie turned it meat hims left lol
Tommy: I survived  Also tommy: dies 42 times
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
Tommy did this with Boffy, yet he forgot half the things lol
5:26 ayo Tommy is sus
This kinda looks like hexit
CHARLIEEE RAN INTO THE TREEE WHYY
17:52 that sounded decent and rhymed
It is not a mod... it is a *modpack* called RLCraft, by Shivaxi.
My god... The ADDS
Tommy: “I survived Minecraft’s hardest mod...”  Also Tommy: *dies 17 times*
i like how tommy calls the battletower golem a dungeon boss and if it really was a dungeon boss he would be going into a shadow dungeon which would itself require an entire series to even get into and to kill the boss would mean to kill the malevolent observer and OH MAN if i could point out all the mistakes these guys made i could literally just coach them and get them strong enough to take down a stage 5 dragon and trust me im an rlcraft god because i literally got a pair of the best armor in the game in 1 day while having nothing to craft it which that armor is called tide guardian armor where i had a green helmet purple chestplate and boots and blue legs and theres your proof to me being an rlcraft OG
I love all of their relationships 😌
Woah hes already close at 10mil? Congrats in advance
Why are u copying Ellpa?
Tommyinnit: Uploads with jjba openings.  1 week later: “Thank you all for 37 million!”
This is a really good video
SCHLATT THAT TWEET OF KANYE IS FROM 2016 WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU ALRIGHT
Make more vid’s per week
Poggers 😎
Who remembers when he did this with boffy?
day 1 of asking tommy to use a different jojo song besides giorno's theme
Song that i know used in this video: A Hat in Time - The Fire Spirits A Hat in Time - Barrel Battle A Hat in Time - New Adventure Animal Crossing Gamecube - Mr Resetti A Hat in Time - Train Rush eShop Theme - Nintendo Switch (Fanmade by Cool and New Music Team)
It was so much fun to watch!!!! This world has a lot of new excited stuff and I would absolutely love to see more! So glad you picked Schlatt and Charlie for this video, you three were hilarious!
7:34 is the timestamp for both of schlatts screams xD

Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago He left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make.   Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 )  ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
intro seems familiar
PLZ DO IT AGAIN THIS WAS JUST.... 1000% FUNNY
Thank God they didn't know about the fishing rod strat or the video would've been a minute long lol

giorno theme is rlly nice
fun fact; in this mod pack you could drown a tier 4 dragon
Can we have a moment of silence for fuckworld our fallen hero. :(
this looks like the most intense thing i have seen
It's not the hardest modpack, that would be the RotN modpack.   RLCraft was originally meant as a joke and is more akin to a lottery than any actual difficulty : you either die instantly because you spawned in a bad spot or survive because you ended up in a good one, and even then luck plays a heavy role in it because if you mine one wrong block or kill one too many animal, some random mob spawns that'll instantly kill you if you don't have enough gear or health - gear that you have to obtain by mining and health that can only gain back by eating. It's a bad design.  Not only that, but even once you have good gear and a somewhat secure home, you still have to grind for ages just to be able to use better swords or armor, or farma certain source of food, or use a certain tool, and the game quickly becomes repetitive and boring because of that random arbitrary limitation that is there just because the guy who made the modpack couldn't be bothered to remove some structures to stop you from getting OP gear instantly.  To be honest, it's sad to know RLCraft is such a popular modpack, and that it has become many people's introduction to modding : it's on the front page of curse forge ffs! There's so many good mods in this modpack that just don't work well with the other mods of the pack and create this huge incoherent mess of designs, items, mobs and blocks.

Every polish person seeing Charlies subtitles at 6:17 whe Jschlatt got struck by lightning: WÓJCICKI!? CZY KTOŚ TUTAJ SIĘ NIE PRZYZNAJE DO SWOJEJ NARODOWOŚCI?! (translation: WÓJCICKI!? IT SEEMS SOMEONE DOESN'T WANT TO CONFESS ABOUT THEIR NATIONALITY!?)
I subbed to him like in March or something and he only had 3 Million subscribers and now its towards the end of may and he is already at 9 million
Woah
JoJo's theme in the beginning is gold
"Am I having a heart attack?" Well- let's just say it wouldn't be the first time
Jesus, so many ads i can't
These comments are the worst place on YouTube, countless spam bots, fake verification ticks, unoriginal comments just quoting for easy likes, self promotion, this is a nuclear wasteland of toxicity on an otherwise really entertaining channel, something needs to be done so a good channel can be a good place to be
This video got me dying 😂
The tested squash nouzilly peep because alley pertinently warm towards a kind fox. old, silly cheek
“Am I having a heart attack?”  It’ll be fine, you’ve done it before.
Ice and fire mod is essey :))))))))))))))

Schlatt giving his cat hugs and kisses is the cutest thing ever
Ur the best tommy

Dood tommy is the fastest growing channel yet
I hate to be that guy but to educate you: That is a modpack, a modpack is a pack of multiple mods that may have been configured to work with the other mods like changing recipes or other values, anyways good content as always!
Anyone realize that the editor probably got tired of editing out the swears and quit halfway lmao
Hey Timmy ain’t it >:)
Oh i loved this video soooooooooo funny
I almost choked multiple times on water from laughing
I cried when the dogs died
yo any old popularmmos fans remember this mod

24:38 tommy just screams so high pitched and it sounds so funny😭✋
TOMMY U JOJO FAN?
The amount you have says 911 but that equals the number of police and what does that go to the bad one known as 9 11
What’s with the elppa music at the beginning
The pope scared the shit out of me
Hope you’ll keep playing this anxiety inducing mod. Seriously tho keep going there is so much you missed.
Jambo was very confused
30 minutes of yelling who watches this trash?
Intro: ~showing a dragon in screen~  Real video: *a boss fight with a person covered with stone bricks and a diamond as an eye*
18:31 slimecicle's rap reminded me a little of hamilton
thats a modpack
Why is there so much as revenue though?
I love how Tommy uses Giorno’s theme for the intro like how Slime did it in his RL Craft video.
he at 911 million
RLcraft
whats the mod name ??
Can anyone tell me what the intro music is?
I just imagine Slimecicle having PTSD when Tommy asked him to play RLCraft with him
I love mr jschlatt

Tommy i have been a sub since 190k and i think your an awesome youtuber
jambo my beloved
Heyo fellow wive haver, Congrats on #2 on trending! Also congrats on getting around 2M in like 2 months. I just want to say.    Thank you so much for making videos, you and your friends (Wilbur, Tubbo, Niki etc.) make me so happy especially because of what’s happing in my life. Society sucks but you make it so much better, without you and your friends I probably wouldn’t be alive because I was this close 🤏 to jumping off a building but seeing that you made a video or went live stops me every time. You are most likely to not realise how many peoples lives you have saved but there is so many I can't even start counting, thank you so much for your time if you are reading this and if anyone else is I want you to read my daily reminder:  Drink at least two bottles of water today  Eat at least one meal today (but please eat 3 if you can xx) If you haven't slept today please sleep If you need to, have some alone time doing something you love, I like doing woman but you might like drawing or dancing or whatever you love doing Don't forgot you are loved no matter your race, religion, sexuality, gender and more (unless your sexist, racist or homophobic. Your not loved, you go fvck yourself b!tch.)  That's it for now! Bye xx
Need some audio balancing on schlatt and slimecicle, they're a little quiet in this vid. Otherwise Great stuff, keep it going RL craft never stops making me laugh.

Hello Tommyinnit I am a huge fan. Im not important or anything im just a frog in a tree who's a small streamer and who is a huge fan of you.
Anyone know who made that remixed Jojos Bizarre Adventuresintro music?
Jschlatt was- ... SOUP WAS THE OFFERING THO!?
R.I.P fuckworld and the other one
how do i double like
Why are you bleeping the cuss words
Early gang
Schlatt: *NOOO FUCKWORLD! WE ALL DIED.....*  Charlie: so it’s true then... fuck world.
Poor fuckworld 😔
oh my god the references "the dog doesn't know english" "but he is fluent is spanish"
When tommy uses jojos theme as his intro Me: sheesh where my jojo fans at?
The most iconic line i’ve ever heard on Jschlatt in this video  “ *zinger* ”
No way, it's the Junkyard theme from  spongebob SquarePants movie the game at 7:28
WE WANT MORE
* watched a old boffy video and tommy has played this before unless the video i watched was fake but probably not *
Tommy should make a series of a rlcraft word. Or even better, a hardcore world. Like this so he can see this.
the difference between schlatt and philza playing this and these guys is hilarious
Do it.do more rl craft
i love the giorno theme music
I wanna see Phil play this with tommy and Charlie
Tommy has 9.11 mill subscribers. Ironic isn't it?
schlatt: _gets struck by lightning_ schlatt: *SACRIFICE TIME*
It is true... I was unsubscribed from tommy
I want part 2 I subscribe
do e sirie
Tommy just used the Ussr anthem what  a twist
Charlie and this mod pack is peak comedy
Can't wait for the very funny and totally original jokes that were inspired by 1:26

If I played this mod..I would have not survived
can you chill with the subtitles
What if he went live and did this that would be pog
Remember fuckworld
The song on the start was giorno theme but remix now I think Tommy knows Giorno
when schlatt started praing i knew i'd die of laughter
7:50 "IS THAT THE GRIM REAPER?"
That rap was epic tho
‘Oh god I want to be unborn’  Said every teen ever
"Give that to me! I'm gonna go have some fun"
Its a modpack not a mod
Bro intro song is lit
hmm giorno theme at the intro... IS TOMMYINNIT WATCHING FREAKING JOJO?
I fucking love Tommy's intros because of the JoJo openings....
#1 trending!
Pov you put 10 ads and in a 30-minute video
A Hat in Time music on the background makes it even better
FOR FUCK WORLD!
schlatt for half of the video: i felt through the floor ;)
RL craft is a modpack
Fly fuck world fly
im eating a sandwich
They should do a full let’s play of RL craft but actually try to fight the final bosses, the tower boss isn’t anywhere close to being rlcraft’s final boss
I like all the types of mod videos but 100 days would be so awesome!
I LOVED this video ,this was sooo cool , like working towards an actual goal and learning the rules of the game ?! SICK . I was kinda cool watching you show off your gaming skills yeah 10/10 would watch again
6:07 is the background music A Hat In Time?!
I like the cuphead music in this vid
now even tommy innit is becoming a jojo reference....
i love the fact that u put the giorno theme
Didn't tommy play this mod with boffy?
Pleeeease play this again some day 😭
Giorno: You’ll never reach your destination
Who else wants this to become a series
GUYS WE NEED HIM TO GET TO 10 MILLION BRUH WE HAVE TO HES GONNA BECOME FUNNIER IF WE DO
8:48 ponzo, u know what I mean if u watched forge labs
Pov: you get flashbacks of pat and Jen

Let’s play pert two pls
Part 2
“His name is fuckworld and he is dead, i don’t have enough skill to eat this bread”
6:59 I was reading the comments for a few seconds, I scroll up and see Schlatt sacreficing his cat to the pope...
Schlatt: "am I having a heart attack?"  *intense flashbacks*
As a fan of Super Mario, I applaud the use of music from Bowser's Fury
3:20 luckers
Slimesicle:I need to upgrade my mouth Jschaltt:I know how pulls out a stick
Anyone else remember when he played this with boffy
9.11 mil :o
You are watching this on a Sunday
that part when tommy was rapping tho 🥵🥵
I've really been enjoying these videos starting with the jojo song, it get me SO HYPED UPPPPPP and i love the transition from you talking to the title AHHH <333
The mobs keep targeting charlie
At the end when Jschlatt screamed "TOMMY" I remember Wilbur screaming it from sadist animation :]

People:talking about schlatt and slimesicle  Me: how in the actual hec does he know jojo??
whats the name of the weird mobs mod?
My question is, why do you still play with Schlatt
You should try ark survival evolved with slimesicles and Jshlatt
plot twist: schlatt is pisskink69
i played this mod, and this was one of the most hardest and confusing mods ever
JOJO
this is sooo funny  1000%
No one: literally no one: Not a single soul:  Chicken tommy: 17:15
should've brought technoblade
Tommy is decent at freestyling
I dare you to try and defeat one of the three bosses of RLcraft, Amalgalich, Asmodeus, or Rahovart. (Some are easiesr than others 😉)
The jojos music hits different
TommyInnit cures my depression and thank you tommy for making amazing content that I watch every day ✌️👍

Tommy, I'm not sure if you'll ever actually see this comment, but I really wanted to say thank you. I was having a really bad day yesterday, but I came on YouTube and saw this video pop up in my recommended. Watching your video was the happiest I felt all day. So I sincerely wanted to thank you.
I love the fact that as soon as Fuckworld died,Tommy made a grave for him/her. That kinda shows that Tommy is a very respectful person :)

"Oh I got some crack"                                       Tommyinnit 2021
god bless slact BUT NOOO THE CATTT
I was drinking water and when they were got to the part when Slimecicle got a cake and he can't eat it because he isn't skilled enough, I laughed to the point I almost choked because he said he needs to upgrade his mouth
Manhunt on this mod would be hilarious but probably impossible
I got flashbacks from PHILZA and jschlatt serie on Hexxit 🌚🌚
New series?!??!?!?
this video is a fever dream
that beat kinda sus😳
he "survived"
I want to see more of this
Seeing three people playing RLCraft and not know what their doing is making me want to watch Cxlvin’s 100 days in RLCraft.     Which is exactly what I’m going to do.
lets go a jojo reference
This is well made!  I would not complain about more rlcraft content.
play orespawn mod

Who else thought techno is gon be in the video??    gotta love how the first bit of swearing is censored and the rest is like the way it is lmao

Schlatt making fun of Tommy for being cautious around pressure plates and then dying to them is so beautiful
dog got drip
One of the BEST videos I’ve seen in a long time
Tommyinnit 2021- that’s massive  That’s what she said
When Tommy got picked up by a bird did anyone see an effect called Penetration II ?
at 22:39 i choked on my sprite bc i was laughing :)
Tommy try to beat the modded ender dragon or play one of the largest mod packs the mods are linked to this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY1lIV4AyBk

the last video tommy made said "WE ARE ALLMOST AT 9 MILLION"
it is still kind of annoying that everyone calls RLcraft the hardest modpack, but that's ok
I litterly had a tear in my eye after fckword’s death, idk if it was because it was funny or because it was really sad
Pls do u survive 100 days in mincraft your squad

congrats with 9million Tommy u deserve 100Milliom tbh!
Love when Charlie died by the tree
Ok since I've been scrolling for way too long only seeing quotes from the video, this is the second time they've used lego batman music in the background and I don't think anyone else realises this.  It plays around 3:03 when Tommy and Schlatt die to the baby zombie.  Lego Batman music was also played on another morph mod video when Willbur loses his beloved in the end. Thought I'd bring this to people's notice as I reckon it's pretty cool.  (Edit: it seems the music plays other times also throughout the video. I thought I was going insane when I first heard these but once rewinding and listening again I realise I'm sane)
I fell into lava, We fell into lava  - *Jschlatt 2021*
You played this like 2 years ago and I miss it so much but y brought it back :)

What’s even worse is the fact that the second dog took longer to die, meaning that fuckworld was actually the second dog that Schlatt could have saved by respawning
Congrats on #1 in gaming!!!!
Can we have a full series of rl craft plz We enjoy a lot?
I remember recommending this a while back! I'm so happy to finally get to see Tommy and his friends suff- I mean, have a great time together in this mod!
Tommy popping off recently with the subs
Jschlatt played this with techno before he probably at least remember the basic stuff thats why he know

When jschlatt wanted to sacrifice his cat I almost laugh to death
are we just ignoring that they slept next to eachother?
I was scrolling down the other videos when i heard Giorno's  theme lol
attempt THREE!  Ok here's a little post that I hope can help you guys! I don't even know if you'll SEE IT but I've been playing rlcraft for fun for a bit and thought you might enjoy a few quick tips here! Please like this so tommy might have a CHANCE of seeing it!  This is just beginner stuff, if you want a late game one later I'd love to make one for you guys!   Biggest things and how to deal with them:  Dragons!  HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM: Dragons stick in a certain proximity to their nest. Fire dragon nests have gold in them, and Ice dragons have silver. If you go underground and find a dragon nest, be warned! That is a level five! level five dragons are the one dragon type that will NOT stay by their nests once they are woken up! Level five dragons are the only ones that have a chance of dropping DRAGON EGGS! You can raise them, but I would suggest saving that for late game! BASICALLY! Do not go near nests unless you can speed the fuck out of there. They will be alerted if you break their gold, so I'd just avoid them until late game.   SEASONS!  NEED TO KNOW: Seasons aren't exactly something you beat, because they're going to beat you. Once winter comes, you're kinda f*cked if you don't have a way of keeping yourself warm! The easiest way is to wear wool armor and sit next to a campfire for a while. Otherwise, in mid-late winter, you will freeze to death every time you go outside. (I would suggest making a season clock to help tell what season it is) CROPS! Certain crops are only able to be grown in certain seasons! The crops and their various seasons are as follows:  SPRING: Carrots and Potatoes  SUMMER: Melon, Sugarcane, and Wheat  AUTUMN: Beetroot, Carrot, Pumpkin, and Wheat.  Saplings, flowers, and ferns grow in every season  MOST HELPFUL THINGS TO HAVE/KNOW ABOUT IN RLCRAFT:  SUMMONING STAFF! Bone, gold, eye of ender! thats all you need for a summoning staff! One of the most OP weapons in rlcraft. It can be used to summon mobs to fight for you! Press B to go into the menu, it's all very straightforward. I HIGHLY suggest getting one of these and leveling up your magic to use it.  Backpacks! there is a mod installed that gives you a backpack! You can put items in it, though it does replace your chest plate. When you die, your items will not despawn if they have been put inside the backpack. Its a very helpful item to have as you can craft them and carry them with you anywhere, as well as being able to place them and use them as chests!  Healing items! Bandages and shit are pretty useful if you're just going on a quick expedition, or on a perilous trip into the mines! Certain healing items can be held and just used on different body parts, or just held and used to heal overall body health. Keep your head on your shoulders, bois! If your head gets hit three times, your entire body is down for the count!  WEAPONS! There is a mod installed that gives you different weapons with different uses, I would say the best one is the halberd, as it does ASSLOADS of damage and has good reach! Also, if you use a two handed weapon with a shield, your attack speed will be very much so impaired! (u fight slow)  COMPANIONS VERY IMPORTANT!  When I say companions I mean pets and mounts that you can have! I saw you guys lose fuckworld, and I thought you might want to know about this stuff if you keep any more pets.  SOULSTONES! A soulstone is made by using a soulgazer, four eyes of ender, and four diamonds. A soulgazer can be used more than once to make more soulstones, but a soulstone can only be used ONCE on a tamed mob! I am telling you how to make a stone before how to tame, because in RLCRAFT it's foolish to go and tame a creature without having a soulstone to bind it! The reason being, once a creature is bound it can be revived/ summoned even after it dies over and over- after a cool down of about two minutes, of course. Soulstones can be used on pets and mountable creatures!  TAMING: You must make different treats depending on what you are trying to tame! The best mounts in the game are the morock and the roc, as they are tamable FLYING creatures and make travel a lot easier! As well as making it so you can fight large creatures from long range, and shoot battletower golems RIGHT OFF THEIR TOWERS! Rocs are the easiest and most common. You just need avian treats and a saddle! (SADDLES CAN BE CRAFTED). Once you have tamed it, use your soulstone and boom! Eternal companion!! You can also put chests on them and use them as storage that you can summon at will!   The best armor in the game is seaserpent armor, by the by. Seaserpents are vicious beasts, though! So be wary!   Battletowers are the best way to get loot quickly, so if you defeat the golem up top everything will breakdown.   NETHER IS NOT WORTH IT IN MY OPINION. JUST DEATH THERE.   final quick tips!  Enchant, enchant, enchant!  Dynamic trees can break your fall if you jump on to them!  JEI (just enough items) can tell you how to craft anything you could possibly want!    I hope this helps y'all! If you even see it!   Have a great day, and don't let rlcraft beat ya down! YOU GOT THIS!
Why can't I subscribe multiple times and it counts. I'm writing this while watching. BTW an s tear weapon in England is a human sheld

Was this mod the funniest ever?
Finally the censor
This video was a nightmare.
29:50 The face of disappointment.
"theres a dark nymph here, hey there beautifu- oh you dont have a face" lol
Nice intro JoJo song
2:51 Give jonald back to ranboo please.
Wow rlcraft is hard but yeah I've done it
you should definitely do the 100 days videos
We need another video with this mode
NoOooO JaMbO- :o
Do these video’s with people that know alot of the modpack
Btw Congrats for 10m in advance and glad that you like jojo song s
well this lot are an interesting combination
I personally think this was the best video he’s made so far lol
Man nothomgs better then watching a nice Tommyinnit video              Of everyone being TOURCHERED 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
BUCKET Y E S
Can we get a Quackity, Schlatt, and Ninja collab?
My 12 yr old lil brother shead a tear when 2 of his dogs died, it was pretty sad
Is no one gonna talk about a fact that Wilbur had a stream at the same time they filmed this, and he said that he's sad because Tommy didn't invite him to the video :(  *Ubdate.:* I was wrong, it was a different recording, sorry that i accidentally lied to you guys, hope you all have a great day :)
i used that dog armor mod once
uh
Im guessing this is crazy craft  Edit: nvm its rlcraft, same thing
Oh yeah, don't you hate it when your hot dark nymph doesn't have a face.
fuckworld our beloved 😔🙏
the editing is different  and i feel weird
little did they know you could just get a flying mount and fishing rod him off the tower
Tommy: I Survived Minecraft's Hardest Mod Also Tommy: *Dies like 50 times*
Subbed before 10 mil
Hey there beatifu- you don't have a face.
Hardcore: *Im a true man* Hardest mod: *ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?*
what mod is this?
funny cus rocs r rly rare
Please make more videos of this type
honestly you make great content :)
U have 911 subs
The destiny music at the end made me very sad and nostalgic after fk World died
u should play this more lol
Sometimes I just think that Slimecicle is the voice of Mike wazowski
Tommy’s profile picture looks like he ate a lemon and chugged taquela thinking it’s water and that’s the reaction 0.00001 seconds before he has a fucking seizure over Charlie as he just realised that his jokes aren’t as funny as he think they are
This is my favourite ever tommyinnit video, I loved this 😮😮😮
You should get Philza on this 😁
8:57 those references haha
HEY HEYE HEETEEYYEY
flashbacks to when he did this with boffy
Tommy is jojo reference
Lol giornos intro
I genuinely cried when Fuckworld died
AYYYY ROAD TO 10 IS ALMOST COMPLETE
the child has grown.
I think yt unsubed me
Schlatt: am i having a heart attack  Oh god not again
More !
Plot twist: many of the people weren't skilled enough to breathe.
I Subscribe You Because You Are Funny
"Please Enjoy The Video COZ WE DID NOT"
JOJO!!!!!!!
Good game
Lmao jojo song

slimecicle already witnessed the horror of rl craft
Rɪᴘ ғ ᴡᴏʀʟᴅ......
"Hey there beautiful- you don't have a face *Walks away*"
Yo tommy you can better rap than Eminem
Bro where’s boffy in this
Timmy ainit here I am American oho see my me gusta
https://youtu.be/uIoWSD9BjIg 🥸🥸🔥🔥
Favoritism of schlatt be like: The name of my pets are Fckworld and *tHe oThEr OnE*
00:27 song name pls
I just love the jojo music in the background
Fucking 9 mil already?
I absolutely love RLcraft I hope they continue playing it!
Schlatt: so i fell under the floor.  Tommy: please elaborate  Schlatt: *smiling*
Tommy Grows So Fast. His YT Channel Is Amazing. He Is The Best Insecure 16 Year Old YouTube Channel. :)
And someone said RL craft was easy but jesus christ what about this
If he had only respawned faster  the dogs would have magically teleported to him
Charlie saying “NOOO” sounds exactly like Agent Pleakley from lilo and stitch 15:32 😂
3:00 that background music sounds awfully like lego batman
The hard game
advance congrats to 10 mil tommy
It’s rl craft
Wait I thought tommy already played rlcraft?
hai
Who else like tommyinnit playing all these mods?
Wow u wrecked minimimter
the jojo music !!!!!!
REQUIEMMMMM TOMMYYYYYINNIT

He has finally heard of my wish!
BEST VIDEO!
I loved this! Would love to see you three fumble around in RLcraft so more :)
rip fuckkk world
When the dogs died noooo
UwU
Its allways fun as a person who knows like a ton about mods to see people go in blind and panic at the sight of anything that does or doesn't move.
well done on 9 mil :D
Giornos theme!??????!!!?!
I love the fact destiny 2 music started to play
Yo Tommy If you want you hatch a Dragon Egg and make it an adult and ride it
Jojo music
Congrats on 9 mil mate :D
Get your here before 1 day reward. | | | V
Jschlatt: *Give that horn to me* Tommy: *oH-Okay-* Jschlatt: *IM GONNA GO HAVE SOME FUN*  Bruh Jschlatt go have a chill pill
its not a mod its a modpack and its not the hardest
Drinking game . Take a shot every time they say fuckworld
Do a herobrine mod
jojjjjo   golden    wind
The fact schlatt could've prevented the other dogs death by just respawning instead of sitting there crying just amuses me because he caused the 2nd death
Well done for 9mil subs
Watch JoJo
16:06
they've made it only for fuCkworld.
Not me seeing this is #1 in trending for gaming:
16:0
Why does Tommy always use music of stuff i like, for example: Halo, Terraria, JoJo etc
FUCKWORLD N O O O O O O

DABABY

Jambo staring at Schlatt after he's offering him for a sacrifice like "man this is the 8th time this week smh"

Best video❤️❤️❤️
TommyInnit once said "man,s got shank"
Always vibing when the jojo's theme starts playing
Bring in The Blade. Not so you can succeed but so that you can farm lots of shrieking footage out of him.
Ageism intensifies

Tommy advance Happy 10M u can achieve it

“My left arm is damaged. Am I having a heart attack?”  *_NOOO SCHLATT NOT AGAIN_*
Put the video to the end, then play again. And its without ads😎
Now i learned that do not underestimate anything in RLCraft
Rlcraft is easyer if you are not an idiot
My aunt is watching a scary movie while I'm watching this and can't stop laughing bc this video is so funny
His name was fuckworld *And now he’s dead* I don’t have enough skill  *To eat this bread*
Tommy: *dying* Jschlatt: I fell through the floor😀

REPEAT AFTER ME: BRING BACK WILBUR BRING BACK WILBUR BRING BACK WILBUR BRING BACK TUBBO BRING BACK TUBBO BRING BACK TUBBO
I need this to be a series

This is why phil is in all mod videos
How its name survived if need friend better dream
Jschlatt gets struck by lightning  Chrls; "im pretty sure god was affronted by something we said." Jschlatt; *looks at the pope*
i'm sorry but whoever decided it was a good idea to use gnf only fans soundtrack is an ABSOLUTE GENIUS
Anyone else pissed that he’s calling it a mod when it’s a modpack?
just noticed tommy using destiny 2's "Journey" at 18:05 making it sound like an epic adventure about to happen sheeesh  Edit: guess they just end up beatboxing for fuckworld haha

Music choice throughout was amazing, really added to the intense moments. Great video yet again big man :D
When you remember that Schlatt and Philza played Hexxit Hardcore and cleared it in one go.

Should do a video with tubbo, philza, ranboo, Charli or slime ,jschlattt , wilburt and that’s your 10 million subs there
Defeating the dungeon boss is easy there is an fishing rod glitch where u can launch him like 1000 blocks

Tommy do be putting giorno's theme but does he watch jojo
Slimecicle has seen it all. He has experienced hell itself
RLCraft is easy if you af are lot of xp i haf playd RLCraft in 3 weeks so i can get dimonds
Since the video started off with Giorno’s theme, I already know that the video is going to be epic.
Who else can only hear the Slimecicle clips watching this video
You can cheese the tower golem by towering up the tower and somewhat above the golem(about 1 stack of blocks from the ground), then use a fishing rod to hook it then release it multiple times, when the tower boss wakes up (descending down to the top tower will wake the boss), it goes flying off the edge.
this is a regular wednesday my dude
Fuckword [*] he was very good friend
0:11 I think giorno is beating Diavolo behind the door
can you do sequel of rlcraft or make a Rlsmp
Tommy puts on anime music for intro lol
No one will notice me.

charlie is speaking with the traumatised tones of a veteran here
B
Jojo music is Pog
Let me in one of your vids

Please Play this again
Finally all the bad words are gone YESSS
My favorite part was 24:00
why did editor lary play gionros theme song at the beginning
Why no one notice the video is 30 mis long ... like what 😩
Tommy u can always make me laugh :)
I love how for the first 10 seconds they blur out the swear words and then for the rest of the vid he doesn’t give a crap
Ok but ngl them teaming up to the top of the tower was one of the coolest shit ever
PART 2 PLEASE!! IN RESERECTION OF FUCKWORLD
"I dont have enough skill to eat this bread" 😂😂😂😂
The algorithm has blessed you
Respect the cuphead music
The tidy throat spectacularly delay because grip counterintuitively cure within a sore burst. rabid, lovely kenneth
You know it is intense when it starts with Giorno's theme
Tommy your the best
You remember when Tommy said were almost at 5 million?

We're not saying "mostly viewers find me annoying..."  Now we're saying "thanks for 9mil"  Mom, I'm so proud of this British kiddo 😭
Ah yeah, Tommy's video - best present on b-day
legends say that they are still playing the game
All I’m gonna say is what the heck did I just witness
Ironically, the only video without "funniest" in the tile is actually the funniest one
what
100 gnecks
Charlie is that one guide at the begging of a game
You should make a series out of RLcraft called "FuckWorld adventures" xD
make this a series please
claim your ticket for being before 10 million
6:14 hat in time music :D
Where dream
I like the JJBA Golden Wind remix. Fits well!
It has giornos theme , Tommy is smart so subscribe
Fun fact defeating the tower boss can be done with a lot of blocks a fishing rod and a spear
Do it again but kill the fucking dragon
RIP Fuck world
You could've just build up the tower and fish the golem that way you dont have to suffer
Great job on 9 mil Tommy!
I wonder if tommy is a jojos bizarre adventure fan
Tommy, a 100 days video would bring me so much joy.
#1 on trending right now!

I watched Tommy like 1 week ago and I come back and he’s already on 9 million subs
Rick Astely

Shlatt : Slowly turns to look at Pope-
This kid is a crack head
Wilbur didn't get invited to this video because Tommy knows that he gets bored after 20 minutes and starts roleplaying and Tommy actually wanted to win one of these
This zoomed cam looks better.

Hi so nice to see u today :D I luv swearing mother chees I love chees :)
I like how the bois were cryin over a the doggoz
Pls make more videos of rlcraft
I MISS PHIL :[
Tommy: “me and the boys are bunkin huh?” Literally not Evan a second later everyone starts panicking because of a baby zombie😂🤣
Seshhhhhh my guy playd rlcraft
did Charlie really make a reference to "why is the dog speaking spanish" at 8:58 also I hate how Tommy can actually rap
The intro awfully looks like Charlie's intro on his video
When the fuckworld said "..." I felt that.
Tommy Schlatt and Slimecicle should do a series
The dogs wouldn’t have died if he just clicked respawn
Nooo you cenzor the swear now noooo
i am starting to think that tommy watches jojo  *not jojo siwa JJBA*
*Completely forgetting that you played with boffy*
7:49 lol
Get him much subs for another vid
6:18  **me in an interview**
I just gotta say yall should try watching tommy's videos with a straight face  it is imposssssible
enjoyed the video! :D
Hey tommy I’ve been a big supporter since you we’re are at 200 subs I’m glad you’ve gotten so far you’ve been my idol for a very long time  I hope you get your price which is 20million you’ve done awesome
Me who knows that jschlatt and ph1lza did something same
do it again
It's rl craft we have it before he uplodes this
7:50 same
Why did he bleep the swears
Pog
Tommyinnit can u do 100days and tame a dragon
I too *fell through the floor*
Omg guys, I can’t believe Schlatt is Herobrine
HAPPY 9MIL!!!!!
Tommy, what happened to your loud beautiful voice?
Congrats for 9m
why every time i watch one of Tommys videos hes gained like one million subs?
R.I.P Fuckworld
R.i.p fuckworld
yooo at fuckworlds death it played music from the destiny OST
Can anyone tell me what's the music he used in the intro, I'm pretty sure I've heard it before
I've been subscribe since 100k
Imagine this becoming a series.
If u get chicken and combine it with bones, u can make treats which u can feed to rocs and tame them, u can then craft a soul stone to bind it to u so tht if it dies, u can bring it back to life. With ds roc, u can fly to the top of the tower, hit it with the fishing rod a bunch, then shoot it with a bow. It is a glitch where it receives all of the knockback at once and u can then loot da top of da tower and get out.
Fuck world would have wanted this to be a series
Fuckworld: *dies* Destiny 2 soundtrack: i gotchu fam
“Man’s got a shank”🔪
I'm subscribed and have notifications on
10 million!!!!
You should a 100 days video, but you should have other people do it with you  Starring soup
When he said they were doing the hardest mod I didn’t think it would be this funny😂😂😂🤣
This is like the time I tried to play RL Craft but like... More coordinated.
tommy:he's a nice guy also tommy:HOLY FFFF-
The big lobster only attacks when you run around it
4:39 😂😂😂
We'll never know if Charlie did catch Tommy or not..
Giorno's theme sounds good in these videos
Boys die fast
5:22 pause tommy
7:00 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SOUP
Please make a video on tommyoutit or something where you show how to get this mod set up because i cant get it to work
Love how Tommy is censoring all swearing in the first minute of the video This man knows how to play YouTube
Schlatts scream is funny.
But now u sick
When I first saw u I thought u were anoying
“Fuckworld” will be remembered.
Love the vid :DDD
Fuck world died in but he will be rememerd
mod+tommyinnit=pog moment
I thought their goal is finding the trumpet skeleton..

If yoo hit 10 mil make a video of the dream smp
Tommy my guy you are far away from fully exploring the mod i hope you find the great castle wich has an op dragon and even better loot
Schlatt: Do i have a heart attack AGAIN?1?1?1
17:20, do I hear Journey, from the Kronos Quartet.  Commonly heard in the game Destiny 2?
2:52 why dise j look so scared
But tf happened to your hair at the thumbnail.
tommy init/best youtuber in history
RIP THAT FUCKWORLD AYYYY 🥲
“That’s a s tier weapon in the United Kingdom” 😂
We want more RLCRAFT
DIDN'T THOUGHT THAT VIDEO IS THE 1st TRENDING FOR GAMING?!!
please play more of that server / play more of the rlcraft server i enyojed it!
ok but tommy kinda popped off when he was rapping tho
I'm getting major Elppa vibes from the words "RLCraft" and the the JoJo music...
9million my man  child well done 9 million is   the number of women   you will get tommy
When Schlatt just prayed to the pope after getting struck by lightning lol
When they realise tommy already played rl craft with somebody else
1:24 "am I having a heart attack?!"     Dang, Jschlatt having flashback from a past live 🤣
I’ve been subbed since 100 k
Nobody: SCHLATT: *recreating lion king scene*
Congrats on trending
6:21 he pronounced my name wrong
theres such a viriety of music in this video, a viriety that i know and love.
I love how the editor puts JoJo bizarre adventure music on the title.
Great video
Fuckworld should be spelled like fukwrld to make more like juicewrld
Funniest heck I’ve ever seen
Who remembered Tommy's old video where he played RLCRAFT mod like, a year ago?? But without these guys.
Just fishing rod the boss
Tommy can u do a 100 day rl craft
do a playthrough and beat a tier 5 dragon
Fuckworlds death was the most emotional I've ever seen Schlatt
I like how in the end schlatt shouts TOMMY
Let’s Go To 10 M
congrats for 1 million TommyInnit!
Tommy: N-No that’s Stormzy—  I DIED
1 mill away poggers
I remember when you played rlcraft with boffy
JOJO INTRO, POG!!
6:21 why the fuck there is polish surname?
Love your Videos (:
RLCRAFT 🤯🤯🤯
Who else thinks this is just ark without dinos.....😐😐😐 this seems easy to me as an ark player
It will be 10000000000% funnier if phil jack and wilbur was there😂
Hexcraft with philza...
some thing i realized is  tommy and his editor made the intro look like that one of his  old rlcraft video and ofcourse jojo theme
You did this with boffy a while back
You survivied but how long? A second....
Congrats Tommy for 9 million🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
10 ads
I beaten the mod 3 times
6:21   Direct reference to the CEO of youtube, Susan Wojckici
Congrats on 9 mil Tommy
.
Reply this with f for fuckwould
I love Jschlatt's sacrifice
Ice and fire isn't hard
He protect . He attack . But most importantly... He jumped in the CADILLAC!!
Charlie: I’m pretty sure god was affronted by something we said Schlatt: * slowly turns and looks at pope *
fuckworld: *dies* schlatt: *starts beatboxing*
Calvin : *amateurs*
I remember when you played it with boffy
Rlcraft dammmmmm :D
Good video but in the name of all that’s good, turn Tommy’s mic down or raise Schlatt and Charlie’s
F in the chat for big fuckworld
Please clear you talk style. So we can understand what you are saying. But if you just abuse by abuse so there is no need to watch your video🙄
congrats on 9 mil tommy!!!
That boss is looking Kinda sus
"Hardest mod"... clearly he hasn't heard of Blood And Bones
This is so funny tommy is the best tommy is Pog
Schlatt: Guys im not gay Also Schlatt whole video : gay jokes

Yo I think the house should be called “Casa de Crater”
This was so funny I love this lmao 😭😂✨
There is a surprising lack of death by dragonfire
i dont know why ive forgotten the name of the song in the intro of this video someone help lmaoo
Fuckworld smp
How jelly with 20 million gets average 100 k likes a day and Tommy got 200 k😂😂
The title doesn’t have the word “funny” or “hilarious.” Unsubscribing.
amm you should say modpack modpack=alot of mods mod=1mod
Tommy: we had one goal and uts to defeat the dungeon boss  Also tommy: AND TO SURVIVE
I couldn't stop laughing the entire video. Everyones' reactions were too good
His channel is growing faster than my beard....😂
"Why do I hear church bells ringing?" My mind: I USED TO RULE THE WORLD
Tommy jojo???
Schlatt: Am I having a heart attack? Me: Again?
Jschlatt is dumb if he could respawn the f*ck world was gonna teleport then both the dog could be save jschlatt is dumb
no because why was I so attached to fuckworld?
Fun fact: RLCract was trending like a year ago. Tommy you're 1 year late
tommy innit knows giornos theme song
Q: do you watch jojo bc theres so much jojo music in your intro
One word          Lol
...
I havent even watched the video yet i know this will be hillarious
don't mean to be that guy but rlcraft is a modpack not a mod 😔
Giorno giovanna
More giorno theme :D
U always chose the coolest mods
NUMBER ONE ON TRENDING LETSS GOOOOO
XD when u say at the intro its the hardest mod of all u mean i saw people at this mod is kinda easy for them lol :v
Love how Charlie said it was going to be a hard time, Tommy and Shalt were like "how hard could it be", then tommy met the spiders
Congrats on 9 million btw! :D
The herobrine transition was so smooth though,
Whoa ever since fuck world died his Spotify plays are extremely high

Yo was that the destiny sound track at 17:11
6:32 schlatt freaks out when god strikes him with lightning
Did Tommy just use a jojo song
PLS DONT COPY SLIMECICLE'S INTRO
If you ever make a series do this 😂
MORE JOJO REFERENCES LETS GOOOO
100k subs in hours????
When you realise Tommy has started watching JoJo's bizarre adventure
8:57 I don't know if that was a reference to anime voice camp but god I hope it was-
How to join dream! I wanna join in dream smp!
NOT JAMBO
Ofc tommy like the tower its made of cobble!
Jschlatt: *Gets struck by lightning*   Charlie: *Proceeds to have a seizure*  Tommy: "Are you okay?"
amogus boss
You have any plans on playing more terraria?
It may just be me, but "Jschlatt" looks like "JohnnyJ" (a cod zombies youtuber)
Tommy always saying YouTube keeps unsubscribing when his subscribers have been rising rapidly for the past year or so 😂
CONGRATS ON 9 MILLION MAN!👍
amogus boss
25:28 when jschlatt said: "I've broken both of my feet" I felt that... Why? Because I sprained my right foot the day that this video came out.
If the multiverse is actually real we would have a funniest tommyinnit video
TheBlake
this video was hilarious. i loved everything about it. keep up the good work!
Tommy, gongrats on 9milion subs
Charlie: I'm pretty sure god was affronted by something we said. Schlatt: *slowly turns and looks at the pope"
I love how you had giorno giovanna's theme in the intro🤣👍
A moment of silence for fuckworld
1:25 intense flash back from dream smp
This video : thanks for 9 mil Last video : thanks for 8 mil Second to last video : thanks for 7 mil  WTF THIS GUY IS POPPING OFF
This is my favorite mod!
Why does Tommy sound like the "Charlie bit me" on crack whenever he calls Charlie
"Jschlatt drowned whilst trying to escape Creeper" 7:21
Tommy and Schlatt:*just pure reactions to the new difficult world*  Charlie:*pure genuine pants shitting fear as the events of the last time he played RLcraft play in his mind*
“His name is Fuck World and he's already dead,I don't have enough skill to eat this bread" —Tommyinnit
Do again
these videos are boring, seriously.  Not trying to be rude but, he needs better ideas
Love the giorno theme in thr background
the intro just hooked me up
Hello Tommy
Timmy aint it
I FUCKEN KNEW IT WAS GONNA BE RLCRAFT

Good choice of music  JOOOOOOOOOOOJO!
Rest in peace Fuck world
SHLATT AND CHARLIE WERE SO SCARED THEY STARTED SPEAKING IN OTHER LANGUAGE

Intro: giorno theme  the video: funny   me: what kind of mix is this
... Other youtubers try to kill a tair 5 dragon and you wanted to kill the ez boss   BTW love you vids
Good Job
The destiny music in the background tho
Mini minter will lose
Finnish be like fackworld is fack the world
If you remember tommyinnit playing this mod with Boffy, you deserve a veterans discount.
THE RAP WAS ACTUALLY SO GOOD WOAH
Vruhtommy unit is so funny lol
Old tommyinnit video vibes
RL craft vs Tommyinnit.  Please do a hardcore 100 days

The public lion electronmicroscopically treat because low formerly guard around a deserted circle. observant, eminent doll

Can we talk sometime Tommy?
This video is the only way Schlatt can get into the #1 Gaming trending :D
17:54 "His name was Fuckworld now he is dead. I'm not skilled enough to eat this bread" I'm not entirely sure why but this line made me cry laugh, mix of emotions I think
15:56
TOMMY IS THE ONLY ONE WHO SAYS THANKS EVERY VIDEO TO US🙂
Proud to say tommyinnit is about 1.5 million subs more than technoblade now instead of tommy using technoblade for views techno will use tommy fur views
Send me the link
Does anyone know the intro song?

Tommy I just want to say thank you. My parents are fighting rn and um I’m rly scared but the comfort of you is helping me so much :) I love you and thank you
O M G

bro schallat could have just press respawn and fuckWorld wouldent fell in the lava
The main goal is easy: just pillar up to the top of the tower and fishing rod it off
I remember schlatt and philza playing hexxit together!
charlie is always so funny
Alternative ending:screaming child tries to beat a popular game with a smile and a president Also swears a lot.......
now beat the ender dragon
Oh wait this was posted today okay  Anyways.  *You wanna hear how I'm doing in RLCraft?*  Hold on- Imma go check how I'm doing again really quickly- sorry- I forgot. All I know is I have a dragon and his name is Emerald. He's also very huge and has a massive appetite. I'm also pretty sure I died 10+ times killing his mother to actually get his egg.
JOJO
Where is boffy?
Please continue with irl craft in this group I enjoyed it really much
Congrats with 9m
R.I.P f*ckworld 2021-2021

HEY, Can you stop insulting badwords on the video subtitle!PLZZZZ!!!??!?
This was intense
Your vids are cool
why is he so fun to watchhhhhhhh  ahhhhhhhhhh
Music : GER awaking LOL
When you realize they could’ve just built up the side of the tower without killing any mobs  ;-;
The name of Tommy’s girlfriend is Holler confirmed?
GOOD JOB ON THE EDITING ELODIE!!!!
7:00 SOUP!
That was revenge for grizly's dogs.
I'm literally dying cuz of laughter
2:00 and then 17:00 is poetic justice
Thats..... Jojo music!
Tommy vahen heard of the fishing rod glich

It's Rlcraft
RIP Fuckworld
Luv ya m8
This video gives me thirty minutes to do nothing, and tell my parents TommyInnit came out with a video and to leave me the fock alone😌👐
I’ve tried it. Its painfull
Fuckworlds in another fucking world now 😔
Giorno theme song
Oooh hyped
what is the music called in the start?
3 farts noice
I need fuckworld merch
You’re welcome for 9 million! You deserve it! ✨✨✨
It would have been way easier if they knew how to fling the boss with the fishing rods
this was the funniest video i’ve ever seen
misclick oops
If rlcraft went a bit further they would do "u dont have enough skill to die"
Fuckworld
JoJo moment in the intro
The cold margaret electrophoretically sip because plastic effectively touch atop a puffy energy. absorbed, scientific permission
We need next episode
3:34 anyone know the music's name?
Top 10 šad es anime moments
I bet he doesn't even remember playing with Boffy
Amen! [*] :(.   Im crying too......... XD
* sees 'hardest mod' *  It's rl craft isn't it
:)
When they did the tower it gave me "Lord of the rings" vibes
RLCraft is not a fucking mod kiddo...
Pog
I think I'm the only one who remembers Tommy playing this with boffy in 2019
As a proud rlcraft player...              PART 2 PLEASE!!
Yeah pogchamp
Be like aboflah and give us cars
I like how the other dog is literally just called "the other one"
WE NEED PART 2 CMONN
If i had a nickel for every time Tommy used giorno's theme in his videos i will have two nickels
This is like the same mod from socksfor1
Tommy: our goal is to defeat the dungeon boss Meanwhile other OGS rod the boss into space
Tommy is great man
No Jambo
Next timer kill ender dragon
Jesus 30:42 but its funny
Let's be honest. Throwing yourself at danger over and over until it works has been done by all rlcraft players at least once.
Heyo ma peeps :3☺️
Schlatt: *Aggressive praying and sacrifice*
big tommy adding giorno theme at the start
KONO DIO DAAAA
The foreshadowing with Charlie telling Schlatt to never assume things from a pressure plate was incredible
o7 too fuckworld and the other one
I cried when FKWRLD died, I cried at the words RIP Fuckworld what is my life
Quakitys lore stream was same time when i was watching
When did Charlie became so serious
mans is #1 on trending for gaming  and he says people find him annoying-
yeah no i just never wanna hear schlatt growl again
AWW SCHLATT GIVING HIS CAT CUDDLES AND KISSING HIM IN THE HEAD IS SO CUTE- (I don’t mean at 6:33 when he made a sacrifice I mean at 18:10)
Notice how it was a day late
ok but tommy, schlatt and slimecicle is like george, quackity and badboyhalo lmao
Close to 10m yes!!!!!
It Sounds like When Charlie did the beat to Tommy he said “boots and skeetzen”
Tommy you made this video on my name day yay
Soo funny hahahahahaha🤣😂🤣😂🤣
The legacy of f**kworld lives 4evr
17:55 the best rapping skills ive ever heard in my life. Eminem is too scared to diss
i was bornin 2012
The unwieldy graphic bizarrely shiver because sort chronologically dare excluding a overconfident flood. secret, savory bed
”I dont have enough skill ti eat this bread” AHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHA
it isnt that hard
Tommy u know whats funny? Me not getting sleep Ahahahahaha (I need help)

Tommy: WE R ALMOST AT 10 MILLION SUBS SO  if u do enjoy consider subscribing MM7: *painful tears*
" *I'VE DROPPED THE ROCK BUT THE ROC WILL NOT DROP ME* "  " *Ok take this rock, now I want you take another thing- my life before it does.* " - slimcalcokockaooalsdoadoodledooo rclcaraft
YESSS THE JOJO MUSIC AT THE START
Almost ten million subs? My counter says 9.1 million 😶
7:42 notlikethis
bruh this isnt a single mod, its a mod pack, a combination of different mods, also what does survive mean for the thomas exactly?
Tommy and charlie:hes probably think of some fucking shit  meanwhile jscaltt kissing his cat Its on 18:15
RL Craft isnt even real life. LOL
This gave me heavy flashbacks to when schlatt played "hardcore" hexxit with philza.
Go invite Calvin he's pro at this and for one new goal defeat a tier 5 dragon and get a dragon egg so you have dragon pet pls tommy and invite sneegsnag he's sad that you not invite him
Shlatt was playing this Mode before
Rip dog 🤧🤧🤧😭🐶
Video idea: you and your friends try to beat this mode but if you laugh 3 times you lose 1 laugh makes your 4 heart dissapear
Good thing your added the best song in history of ever. (I mean giorno's theme)
Where is gogy?
Slimesicle Was right! Never trust those Damm Pressure plates, RIP FuckWorld
0:30 jojo fans unite we have found out our boy tommy has found CULTURE

"Men Likers vs. Women Enjoyers"  ... God damn it, and I thought I just got over my sexuality crisis

17:08 For whoever recognizes that song, it’s called “Journey” from Destiny 2.  As you can tell, I am a shameless Destiny fan.
When he said he upgaded his hearts like legend of Zelda I was playing legend of Zelda breath of the wild
Tommy's vids just make my day

Bionic??
Tommy is better than piedipie he should have 100 melon subs
yo you really slow at this socks for one has already played and completed it
i am just loving the intro evolving overtime <3
THE MOD IS CALLED RLCraft!!!!!!! Because I have the game and it is had and scary.I tamed 4 dragons red,Sophie,bronons and light blue.
You cant hide it, you know that boss looks like a sussy imposter.
"Whenever you feel useless, remember that white pencils like me exist"  -White Pencil
Giorno's theme is fitting for the intro - He probably put tommy in a death loop
At the start they censor the swears. After that the editor gave up
i remember u played this before with with boofy
Wow an amazing vids
0:30 all JoJo fans
🍑🍑🍑🍑
do part 2 ay?
honestly one of, if not my actual favorite video. it was hilarious.
Niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
So you do it again I made 20 id's and subscribed
Tommy: he’s thinking about fucked stuff Schlatt: **kissing his cat**
Congrats on getting on #1 on trending for gaming.
Tommy, that isnt a mod, thats a mod pack xD
At 26:38 when slimecicle died it said git gud and I know from playing hollow knight before (which is a very guuuud game) that the creator or creators of the mods have played hollow knight
13:48 anyone know what the name of this music is
It's required to know the difference between Fuckworld and Fuck World
Congrats on 9 mil Big Man!!
Every time I watch Tommy the subs go up
alt tittle: 3 ppl trying to survive mc
And that was hillarious
Tommy: he’s thinking about some f#%ked up sh*t What he’s really doing is hugging his cat
dogs: *are dead* the others: *sad beatboxing*
Nooo fuckworld
Pls make this a series
amogus
when the music for when f world actually makes you sad because you know what it is for
As an RLcraft player, this is just torture and the funniest thing ever in one video.
6:31 i started dying.....
CAN WE JUST TALK ABOUT THE ATTACK ON TITAN THEME IN THE STARTING
Watch tommy actually get to 10m before miniminter
We got number 1 trending on gaming boils POGCHAMP
The death of fuckworld and the other one was actually sad tho
There is a lot of saturation in your mic :/
yeah, it's great to see other content!
soooooooooo... am i the only one who cried during fuckworlds funeral?
They got a fishing rod why not use it no knowledge
Why is tommy so loud compared to the others in this video?
We need an F in the chat for Jchlatts' dogs
Guys if you want to know the dragon’s mod it’s Ice and Fire
the next dog shall be called fuckmod
Heheh, nice video you’re content is awesome bud!
2 goals not one
Nice job ripping off Charlie
LoL playing rlcraft I think love that modpack
Dungeon boss so ez... U should of been trying kill dragon 5th form
Sorry tom for being LatE I have to get my beauty sleep

Fuck worlds death  made me cry he will not die in vain
imagine if water had surface tension in RLcraft
I can’t believe he didn’t put 1000% funnier In his title
MANS GOTTA SHANK
Why so many ads tommy?
This was a sick video, didn't even feel like 30 mins. Definitely looking forward for more stuff like this 👍
Can we have a part 2 with wilber soot?
THAT WAS EPIC!!! Thanks Tommy, I had a lot of fun whatching this video
Fuckworld😞
Please stop censoring its was so fun
*Tea!!*
DID     I      ASK ? ? ? ?
Remember when Tommy was happy for 300k our little child has blown up 😢
RIP fuckworld
too bad Boffy isn't in either  and why the heck Tommy look like noob for early minutes while he'd been play it before
can we all take a moment to look at charlies face when he was blown up in the tower
the pressure plate foreshadowed schlatt and his dogs' death
Happy 9m sub  🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
17:52
Turning 16 in 8 minutes, going to go into being 16 while watching this video
The bond between charlie and schlatt is just 👌
I just Love the new intro music! 👍

17:46 TommyInnit did the nazi arm thing
"I survived Minecraft's hardest mod" *proceeds to die about 30 times in a video*
My man went from 2 mill 6 months ago to almost 10 mill.  Dude mad respect for him
The ads on this...
You think this is HARD Me and my friend have started a series on RLCraft and we died SO much more than you guys but yeah I guess this is hard

Hilarious
I recently got into JoJo's and it's actually pretty great. I thought it would be bad but it's not.
well done for 1 trending on gaming !!!!!!!!!
6:18 "Ah! ah- oH! Da shoul theAA- wojcicki- gajoa- rauki- ragru- gointobed-"  -Slimecicle, while terrified by almost literally anything in RLCraft, chanting random spells in hopes and dreams to motivate themselves to beating the game, and also inspiring the whole world, while making me feel like this was the slowest yet fastest 6 seconds of my life, while attempting to mix match English and Latin while having a trseok, 2021
Epic
amazing video thanks for making it
Charlies PTSD was kicking in this video
1:26 for the people the smp you know the reference

I Have to say... The dungeon boss IS Very easy to kill. I need just blocks And fishing rod. Easy!!!
This video is very bizarre *wink*
someone survived 100 days in RLCRAFT in HARDCORE, sure its hard..
Top 10 saddest anime deaths  #1 fuck world's death
plss upload more frequently
Everyone gangsta til fuckworld becomes a real rapper
Tommy: -_- Herobrine: (*flexing around*)
Everyone crying over f^ckworlds death:  The other wolf: baby I’m not even here, I’m a hallucination
Tommy’s skywars skills come in clutch 😂
tommy you good?

What mod is that?
Next vid idea: train Ur dragon mod
I love how editor Larry blurs the swear words but then can't be bothered to do it for the rest of the video
I had a dream on tommy lol
This is starting to be a series; RLCraft SMP?
Here are some funny bits   6:19 7:40 7:52 9:49 10:31 10:46  11:01 13:33 13:54 14:39 14:54 16:08 16:27 - The death of f-world and the other one  22:50 23:17 24:35 30:50
The real story of stranger things..
now try doing it for 100 days in hardcore 😼
Tommy, don't ever do this to yourself again. There's no reason to make yourself suffer like this. You're better off enjoying yourself with funny mods that make you laugh than making yourself suffer like you did in this video.
Charlie: but I'm pretty sure god was affronted by something we said Jschlatt: proceeds to turn around and look at cardboard cutout of Pope Francis
MAKE THIS A SERIES RN
YOOOOOO GIORNIO THEME
Tommy how could you forgot about boffy

*Giornos theme playing*

Realise i had sub to tommy when he has 1M sub, and now he has 9M sub! Thats so awesome TOMMY DESEFVE THIS!
You should make it a series

*Il Vento D'Oro in the beginning* Me:- This is a masterpiece.
Come on you got this bet mini minter

If Phil was here he would just go hardcore mod and save all. BUT GREAT VIDEO
Epic
My day is perfect now my day is complete...
Slime:Rlcraft lolololl
I like how some destiny soundtrack is included when Fuckworld died on the same day VOG comes I think the editor plays destiny    It's crazy theory I know

ayo the real ones remember when he played this with boffy😔✊
MEMEnto

PLEASE do an RLcraft series!!!!!
You should have invited boffy

Tell Larry good job
Good job with the jojo song
I hope we get you to 10million      BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE POGGGERRSSSS

Charlie and tommy: trying to survive Jschlatt: i got dogs! :D
If Philza,Wilbur,Quackity,Ranboo and Tubbo in here it was 1000% REALLY FVCKIN' FUNNY.
It’s rl craft my worst enemy
I loved that
pog moment
EVEN MORE PROOF EVERYTHING IS A JOJO REFERENCE
Hey tommy
"survive" Wow is this the new mission impossible?
When fuck world died:  o7
Tommy: "I've been shot in the head and now I'm blind." *Tommy dies What we're all thinking: Tommy: "I've been shot in the head and now I'm dead."
i think the intro is a jojo refence
Am I the only one who’s never seen any of these three more stressed and concerned and terrified before? Like they all genuinely looked stressed out at the end 🤣
Try rlcraft
0:30 GOLDEN WIND
JOJO DADADAAAA
ahh yes jschlatt ... <3
Rip fuckworld :(
Pogggggrsssssssss
Seeing Tommy suffer is the best moment of my life
fuckworld
Amazing video keep it up tommy
Old Intro
The only thing that got my attention is the destiny soundtrack when f***world died
This simultaneously pains me and makes me howl.
EPIC
this mod unbeatebe because ender dragon is  the easiest one
Lmao Tommy’s nabed calvins idea twice U guys know the other one
"hear holler, holler? Isn't a name of a girl..."  Tommy will be screwed at college
7:49 that do be a jump scare tho
Is rlcraft really really hard cause i survived in the world of rlcraft without dying and without a house tho
Well done and what a great video!! From your friends at ❤️Little Dreamers At Home!!
congrats on #1 trending
Jojo intro
TommyInnit: minecrafts hardest mod Fundy: :(
#1 on trending for gaming
Look at all the fucking ads... jk love your videos, kutgw
Away aren't you doing this with dream and techno
6:28 I'll be honest Tommy, for the life of you I could not tell you. But I'm pretty sure god was affronted by something we said...  *Schlatt looks at  P   O   P   E*  *Schlatt PRAYS??*  This is a "oh god" moment if I've ever seen one.
OMG this Rlcraft
BROOO I REMEMBER WHEN HE DID THIS WITH BOFFY!! im so glad this mod came back :D
“There’s Always Room For Improvements or something idk... Socrates Said that”                               ~ Jschlatt 2021
Journey sounded pretty nice in the video
Anyone lonely text here I'm lonely :(
This was an opportunity to invite Calvin on and laugh at how bad tommy and the others were but that would be too easy
Kinda reminds me of Terraria actually
I like how these videos always start out with the swears bleeped out and like a third of the way through the editor just gives up
Number 1 gaming trending This is pog
7:46 that will be in my nightmares
Your next line is: WE SURVIVED 100 DAYS IN RLCRAFT

Tommy's rap sounded awfully similar to Dean Pelton's from Community at 19:28
the fact that he used jojo theme and its very intimidating
Where is boffy?!
More videos on this mod pls
Ayo he is using the giorno theme !!!
L O N G S W O R D
HOLLER????
Tommy this is not the first time to play rl craft he really did play one and old video check it out
GONNA GET THAT DIAMOND PLAY-BUTTON

Watch out rappers Fuckworld Incoming
8:12 "I need to upgrade my mouth"           "I mean hey, hey. I know a way😏"
Hello, my life saver✨🦶
that intro was goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
Tommyinnit wacth jojo?
Tommy should do a 100 days on a world with turbo and dream should code secret mods! Like so he can see :)
It’s so cool to finally see them play Rl craft
"Holler is the name of my-" WE HAVE TO KNOW TOMMY
Why does tommy always use cuphead music
My brother plays RLcraft and every time he plays it, he rages
Can we get a RIP for Fuckworld 😞
Now this is the mod we needed
#21 on gaming 😳
Problem: *me crying over anxiety and just current life solutions* Solution: *watch Tommyinnit*
Why do the things that happen and everything just screams anime plot to me
Dungeon bosses are ez bruh just rod them while your far from them
ur mom
One of the most opiest video of tommyinnit mark my words
Sometimes I doubt he deserves 9M, not 10M either.  YouTube doesn’t unsubscribe dude. It’s a clickbait saying. And it somehow works.

That video was pretty awesome, everyone did a great job making it! I laughed a lot and would definitely like more videos like this :)
The mobs with purple fire are fast, strong and Will give 20xp.for the mobs with effects Will give u something like enchanted armour or waepon.   I play rlcraft for like now 2 years :)) U can speedrun rlcraft too by killing the ender dragon wither and the 3 or 4 New bosses

I don't know how but these men just make the best storylines for these. This is epic.
rip fuck world… 😔☝🏻
Another success big T! Congratulations on 9 million!
This mod feels like sword art online
the jojo music adds everything together
It would be good let’s play, but  I don’t think they would it
“I remember from hexxit” Felt that
Lots of reply has tons of bot.This is a problem.
attempt two!  Ok here's a little post that I hope can help you guys! I don't even know if you'll SEE IT but I've been playing rlcraft for fun for a bit and thought you might enjoy a few quick tips here! Please like this so tommy might have a CHANCE of seeing it!  This is just beginner stuff, if you want a late game one later I'd love to make one for you guys!   Biggest things and how to deal with them:  Dragons!  HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM: Dragons stick in a certain proximity to their nest. Fire dragon nests have gold in them, and Ice dragons have silver. If you go underground and find a dragon nest, be warned! That is a level five! level five dragons are the one dragon type that will NOT stay by their nests once they are woken up! Level five dragons are the only ones that have a chance of dropping DRAGON EGGS! You can raise them, but I would suggest saving that for late game! BASICALLY! Do not go near nests unless you can speed the fuck out of there. They will be alerted if you break their gold, so I'd just avoid them until late game.   SEASONS!  NEED TO KNOW: Seasons aren't exactly something you beat, because they're going to beat you. Once winter comes, you're kinda f*cked if you don't have a way of keeping yourself warm! The easiest way is to wear wool armor and sit next to a campfire for a while. Otherwise, in mid-late winter, you will freeze to death every time you go outside. (I would suggest making a season clock to help tell what season it is) CROPS! Certain crops are only able to be grown in certain seasons! The crops and their various seasons are as follows:  SPRING: Carrots and Potatoes  SUMMER: Melon, Sugarcane, and Wheat  AUTUMN: Beetroot, Carrot, Pumpkin, and Wheat.  Saplings, flowers, and ferns grow in every season  MOST HELPFUL THINGS TO HAVE/KNOW ABOUT IN RLCRAFT:  SUMMONING STAFF! Bone, gold, eye of ender! thats all you need for a summoning staff! One of the most OP weapons in rlcraft. It can be used to summon mobs to fight for you! Press B to go into the menu, it's all very straightforward. I HIGHLY suggest getting one of these and leveling up your magic to use it.  Backpacks! there is a mod installed that gives you a backpack! You can put items in it, though it does replace your chest plate. When you die, your items will not despawn if they have been put inside the backpack. Its a very helpful item to have as you can craft them and carry them with you anywhere, as well as being able to place them and use them as chests!  Healing items! Bandages and shit are pretty useful if you're just going on a quick expedition, or on a perilous trip into the mines! Certain healing items can be held and just used on different body parts, or just held and used to heal overall body health. Keep your head on your shoulders, bois! If your head gets hit three times, your entire body is down for the count!  WEAPONS! There is a mod installed that gives you different weapons with different uses, I would say the best one is the halberd, as it does ASSLOADS of damage and has good reach! Also, if you use a two handed weapon with a shield, your attack speed will be very much so impaired! (u fight slow)  COMPANIONS VERY IMPORTANT!  When I say companions I mean pets and mounts that you can have! I saw you guys lose fuckworld, and I thought you might want to know about this stuff if you keep any more pets.  SOULSTONES! A soulstone is made by using a soulgazer, four eyes of ender, and four diamonds. A soulgazer can be used more than once to make more soulstones, but a soulstone can only be used ONCE on a tamed mob! I am telling you how to make a stone before how to tame, because in RLCRAFT it's foolish to go and tame a creature without having a soulstone to bind it! The reason being, once a creature is bound it can be revived/ summoned even after it dies over and over- after a cool down of about two minutes, of course. Soulstones can be used on pets and mountable creatures!  TAMING: You must make different treats depending on what you are trying to tame! The best mounts in the game are the morock and the roc, as they are tamable FLYING creatures and make travel a lot easier! As well as making it so you can fight large creatures from long range, and shoot battletower golems RIGHT OFF THEIR TOWERS! Rocs are the easiest and most common. You just need avian treats and a saddle! (SADDLES CAN BE CRAFTED). Once you have tamed it, use your soulstone and boom! Eternal companion!! You can also put chests on them and use them as storage that you can summon at will!   The best armor in the game is seaserpent armor, by the by. Seaserpents are vicious beasts, though! So be wary!   Battletowers are the best way to get loot quickly, so if you defeat the golem up top everything will breakdown.   NETHER IS NOT WORTH IT IN MY OPINION. JUST DEATH THERE.   final quick tips!  Enchant, enchant, enchant!  Dynamic trees can break your fall if you jump on to them!  JEI (just enough items) can tell you how to craft anything you could possibly want!    I hope this helps y'all! If you even see it!   Have a great day, and don't let rlcraft beat ya down! YOU GOT THIS!
:0 elodie edited this! So cool!!
I love it when this notification shows up "Someone liked your comment" and "You have a new subscriber"
Guys! You won't believe it, I checked if I was subscribed, turns out there is a glitch going around that unsubscribes you! Subscribe 🙃
Schlatt and Techno played RLcraft together xD
I love how the editor just gave up on censoring after 2 minutes
You sould do a 100 days in hardcore RLCraft or 100 days in hardcore Pixelmon it super fun
Hi tommy you probably won’t see this but if you do pls give me a sign that you did, I just wanted to make you realise how special and awesome you are and I want you to realise that you have affected a lot of peoples lives including mine in a good way 😄
The "but it is extremely fluent in Spanish" reference was actually from an another series including Grizzly, Slimecicle, Jschlatt, etc. And they needed to dub animes.  Jschlatt once dubbed a dog to speak Spanish, that's the reference.
Whens F*ckworlds new song gonna hit?
6:36 hhahahaha omfg
Didn’t u alredy play with boffy
Finally a hard mod, and not a funni mod 😂
16:08 hold up is the trumpet skeleton supposed to be sans from undertale reference

16:56 Thats The best TommyInnit Face I've ever seen
You know what's funny? Charlie at the start, when Tommy was scared of the pressure plate, told Schlatt that assuming that might kill him one day. Fast forward to when Schlatt, fuckworld and the other one all for because of a pressure plate/lava trap

Rest in peace: Fuckworld. The hit rapper, Fuckworld the dog, followed his owner: content creator Jschlatt into a trap. But, maybe it was for the good, Fuckworld had been through loads of pain, and it finally ended, and with his owner. Fuckworld the dog liked to growl in his raps, his signature growl was the “AUGEHEIDJEJIEUDJKEODKMWJSJEISKSRRRRRRRR” one. May he forever rest in our hearts.
Manz ready for  opps with flint shank

What did you do to undertale intros? But JOJO intro is pretty better
I liked the intro
"it's a little intense," he says before dying about 15 thousand times after
That intro though-
you didn't survive you made it out alive there is a difference
Pog

Gaymer god
Keeps getting crazier
I am not even going to finish that  video
Roomy or Schlatt does anything Charlie: Vietnam flashbacks

This is RLC right?
Where did "people find me annoying at first" go?
We are almost at 10 million Currently at 9.1 million subscribers
Fishing rods: am I a joke to you Only mod packs player understands this
As somebody who plays rlcraft, the scariest thing about this is that dungeon boss is one of the easier bosses.
Dude giorno's Theme is lit!
jshlatt: am I having a heart attack? also jshlatt: *flashbacks*
Free soup!
Tommy: THIS WAS SO HARD Socksfor1: (with 1100 days) first time?
Schlatt: *Praying to Mr Pope, offering sacrifices, and acting like a ‘father’ again, being STUCK IN A WALL* Tommy: *Constantly scared,  ‘what the f*ck’, following Charlie and Schlatt* Charlie: *Actually trying to survive, knowing mostly everything, literally going through hell*  The Dog: *Literally just there until it dies*
only og's remember when he did this with boffy
CONGRATS ON 9 MILLION AHHHHHHH
Did he just censored the curse-words?
Could've just called it pokemon mod lmao
This has got to be my favorite video so far 😂
"Woah thats a nice chest" - tommyinnit 2021

6:16
Can we talk about how he stopped censoring the swears around a quarter into the video?
I remember u played this with Boffy a while ago
Found this in my recommendations. Watch and hit subscribe button : >
Okay, tommy. We get that you're trying to get subs by saying "iT uNsUbScRiBeS yOu" just stop. First off, it's HIGHLY annoying. Second, there never HAS been a "glitch" where this happened. Third, it makes me cringe and almost makes me want to do the opposite of what you want me to do.  (Here come the TommyInnit stans saying I'm wrong)
Next goal: play until you can use the iron nunchucks
i honestly thought schlatt was gonna make a gay joke
Could you make a series out of it? With like some more episodes, that would be cool.Nice video!!
Hes popping off
800K and tommy get 10M
It's funneh and her SIBLINGS played this 🤩
Lets be honest dont do this rl craft
*am I having a heart attack?*     PTSD : History repeats itself
Someone's been playing a lot of 3D World
Good luck Tommy  Because there are still many more bosses That you have to beat such as the weather and the Anders ragging but they've the buff up a good bit and there are some other bosses in the In the game also tip try to go for dragon armour One of the best armour sets and it's easy to take out a dragon than at sea serpent trust me I know
Ngl Charlie is Good at rap stuff man
This was the best video
Lmao I love how when schlatt gets struck by lightning he looks at his pope cutout

I wan't to see tommy and the others play scary map, it will be 1000% funnier.
Hey Tommy, try uploading your live streams a bit on YouTube also... Or stream them on both Twitch and YouTube... Because Twitch kind of sucks, and IDK why, but my internet, which can run an 8K video, isn't able to run a 1080p video in Twitch with no buffering...
Okay, this is epic
Rip the other one
dream 2030 in this video i speedrunned RLcraft
Schlatt is just living life man.
Rip fuck world 😪
why are the church bells ringing? bc we are going to see god. Best line ever
Tommy walks up to the tower the boss astonished after seeing meatcanyon the craft jumps off making Tommy the pogger
I have a question. Why the composed table of the long sword looks like something. 21:50

Im sad that they didn't invite Willbur :(
Tommy are you a not a child
Born to die
Yes finally its back😃
RLCraft is so frustrating they have to actually do teamwork this time
Soup's face was enough to tell that he's used to Schlatt's stupid shit by now
People do hard-core in this mod
i dont get why people find him annoying TOMMY IS THE BEST
"I need to upgrade my mouth" "I mean hey- hey- i- i know a way"
This gave me major 2015 popularmmos vibes
I'm not sure "survived" is the right word for what happened here.
Why does the battle tower golem looks like among us
I want longer video
Honestly would give up the weekly dif mod videos for a rl series with these guys
Bruh
Da hek? Why didn't I get a notification!?
Im actually crying fuckworld
17:10 I wasn’t expecting the destiny 2 music there😢.
pls 100 days would be so funny
This is the most chaotic video ever. And half of it's because Schlatt is there
Fundys career is dying
i’m so glad that tommy uses everyone’s POVs and not just his own, as well as puts captions, it’s very helpful:)
R. I. P. fuck world im crying
Can you do 100 days in the hardest mod

It's not mod it's a modpack

can we go in creative mode in RLcraft?
Amazing I love it. Try climbing up the side and fishing rod the golum off the tower that way the tower won’t explode
PLS RL CRAFT AGAIN
20:25 herobrije
OG TOMMYINNIT TYPE VIDEO
You could've defeated the boss easily, if you built all the way up and used a fishing rod on him a bunch then go near him he would've been sent flying
this was one of your best videos in a while. would love to see more of this.
this would’ve been 100x better without schlatt
This is next level content my fellow comrades
JSchlatt when fuckworld died: **sad beatboxing**
u psychopath
3 forge labs
how is this still monetized? 😂😭
Did-- did Tommy legit start using Journey from Destiny 2 when fuckworld died??
only real ones remember the techno schlatt rlcraft combo 😩
best armor for RLcraft = Chestplates and helmets
If you hit 10M then you have to do it no matter what, even if you don't wanna
I love/hate how when fuckworld died, Schlatt grabbed Jambo. I love it bc its sweet, but I hate it bc its sad
Tommy: he’s probably thinking about some fricked up crap Schlatt: innocently hugs cat
Also, "i survived"
He is taking after Charlie *This isn't gonna end well*
Is that a jojo's reference
dragon i like dragon
You know when thjs video is gonna be crazy when schaltt gets struck by lightning.
(I still didn’t start the video maybe jst the intro but still) I know he’s gonna easily die in a funny way
11.32 is jsachlat gay?
TOMMY USED A SONG FROM THE DESTINY 2 SOUNDTRACK HOLY SHIT
If you get 10m sub you have to show your Mom

Hi tommy
16:59 Sad monents
I saw these guys as guests on the chuckle sandwich podcast
bro i had my glasses off and i thought chsrlie was shirtless
❤️
If anyone's wondering, the music after the Halo song at roughly 17:35 is Destiny music - song is "Journey" from Destiny 2.
Make an rl craft series
The hardest mod for tommy is techno-mod. He won’t survive it for a minute.
9:33 LOL I know why he looked at the priest 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 please tell me if you get it he turned around like you did this?
that bowser's fury music really made that tower invasion really epic!
Jschlatt : am I having a heart attack?! *flashback to last year*
This so cool that u have play this mod pack Mr.Innit.
"This zombie's got a dagger-" Famous last words.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW THIS IS NUMBER ONE IN GAMING?? GOOD JOB TOMMY!

THE JOJO OPENING IS GOLDDDDEN
Fun fact: youtube's account joined 51 years ago
Legends know that he did rl craft with boffy before
Road To 10 Mil GANG
To all my fellow rlcraft sweats  This hurts to watch
*I must make a sacrifice.*
was this RL?
I’d watch this again!
Y’all should do this again
Can’t wait for Twitter to cancel Tommy for playing with jschlatt
the way schlatt looked back 🤣🤣🤣
I loved the video and the Jojo music
I am still surprised that Tommy's room is not setup like other You Tuber rooms lol😂 respect for Tommy 📈📈
I have never seen a better made intro wow
Tommyinit uploading is like a reward for existing
When Schlatt sacrificed his cat to the pope I was dying
tommy: oh, it doesn’t attack! 5 seconds later: *attacks*
yar plz man
6:40 what the actual f**k shlatt
Congrats on 9M Mr.innit!

I love how he always starts his intro with jojo music
RIP fuckworld
Did he catch him?
hes  already done this video idea like a year and a half ago with wisp??????
rip fuckworld and the other one,  you will be missed.
He should do movie theme videos soon like he is in a bunker and then there's titans or kaijus Outside and he needs to make a mech to fight them
Charlie has officially cracked. He is anxiety personified as a human😂
29:52 lol 😂😂😂😂😂
The reason why Charlie is scared and panic cuz he play before and is was hilarious
"Why Is the wolf skilled enough to wear clothes but IM NOT" Me: One word.  D O G
Always nice when JCat makes an appearance
when the Video is a giant JoJo reference
'rip fuckworld' 'rip the other one'
Honestly there raps were low-key a bop
So know ones talking about how this is literally SAO?
as an rlcraft god this is gonna fucking suck
Yass
Yes Tommy 100 day and wow Tommy you can rap ohhhh
Your videos are really fucking funny😆 I never get tired of watching them😆
I love how tommy  was rhyming fuckwold death
"Hes got the bart grasp on ya"
If you remember Jschlatt already played this with Wilbur
I wanna see more rl craft
It’s concerning that that the swear words are starting to get blocked. Very, concerning. Edit: Ok its only at the start. Less concerning. 17:16 CHICKENINNIT
So absolutely no one is going to mention how good tommy is at free style rapping?
I just wanted to thank you so much for always making people laugh! I just lost someone recently and it’s been really hard, but watching your videos makes my day 100000000x better! Thanks for always putting a smile on people’s face when it’s hard ❤️👍🏼
Isnt this just rl craft good luck with the dragons and the level 5 dragons and shiz dude
*Intro plays* Me: *WAS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE*
Do you like jojo?
What I noticed here are  Schlatt -gets struck by lightning Techno - Don't you see history reapeting itself?!!?   And finally when tommy was grabbed by the strider 14:40 one of the effects say he was penetrated II and he seems to enjoy it
Golden wind...

Yo tommy got some bars

It's hard to see you guys play rlcraft cause it's easy and you can defeat dragon in iron Armour.
jschlatt: am I having a heart attack?  flashbacks
Honesty I would like to see more of this
Yo tommy got some bars
Congratulation on 9M subs Tommy. 1M to go for a Diamond Play Button.

Wait... The intro is... A JOJO REFERENCE POG!!!
Please make this a series
Seeing tommy without his headphones in the thumbnail feels off since he always wears them
Imagine if Tommy did a 100 days lol
Abso-fucking-lutely want more RLcraft videos
But RL craft is easy.
schlatt with that horn-
The fact that this is one of the easiest bosses in the mod makes me feel unconfutable
this would genuinely be a good series
Poor Schlatt, He was so fucking scared.
Wow almost 10mil I still remember when you had 400k subs
i lost it when tommy said hole covered and charlies smile
When you realize that the golem was the easiest boss in rl craft
That Village is like Devil Village
Knowing that charlie played this a long while and hearing the same music charlie used in his rlcraft video makes me happy
The Jojo music tho
4:40 It's coming down
Love the intro can u keep it on that one
No hate but I liked ur old video's better where u would just hang uk and the dream smp content was so freaking funny
Can we have a part 2 plz!
Imagine dream played that mod
4:41 DEAD CHARLIE
Bro i just cry when fuckworld died man rip fuckworld
The best team up ever
This is the funniest episode out of all of Tommy’s videos
Yes golden windd
lmao the pressure plate came back for jschlatt
U should do a mod video with jack ranboo philza and slimecicle while charlie does a lot of riffs and ranboo says a lot of rbs beers and burgers
“I survived”
Good video idea
WHER ALMOST AT 10 MILLION SUBSCRIBES .. said tommy at 9.1mil
Tommy's startin to steal charlies intro (this is a joke, funny right?)
I love how tommy said i dont care about the money before but now he has a million ads on he video
Its so uncomfortable that the thumbnail, y has no headphones like his other vids
More
Wheres Boffy?
He should get Boffy back in here
9:00 I got that reference, and I'm so happy it was made
Imagine the entire DREAMSMP Cast plays RLCraft and it becomes a series
“Hey look, it’s Bart!”  Ah, Bart must be cousins with Slim Jim then. Hope Jim is doing alright :) PETTHEJIM
17:02 Schlatt figures out that when he gets revived he will kill Sapnap for killing pets as he knows how it feels to lose pets
This is giving me flashbacks to Slimecicle and Jschlatt videos "Apple"
hello tommy
The whole vid :CHARLIE CHARLIE CHARL-
This is the most problematic team I’ve ever seen in my life and I love it
Why was Tommy’s rapping low key good tho
tommy road to 10mil subcribers for diamond play button review bro this is gonna be awesome

Youtubers: YouTube bug unsubscribing people, blahs, blahs, blahs  Me: Are you sure that's real?

Hi

17:18 you really just gonna kick me in the gut with Journey, huh?
do this mod again
What if you ask Dream To play This Mod With you and I Promise you he will be Raging the whole time :D

When Jschatt's dogs died I almost cried not gonna lie🤧
Hey Tommy, I know u probably won't see this but your videos give me a lot of joy even at the hardest days. They also make me forget I get no likes on my comments
I feel like they drank coffee because how hyper they are

Love the jojo music tommy
Charlie you bit me!
If YouTube unsubscribes that means they were bits
o7 F*ck world
This was a great video honestly!! I think it will fun to watch a part 2 of RL craft provided that u play with the same people for the same amount of entertainment..
This was great, a 100 days vids of your videos sound really fun to watch :D, the chaos, the jokes, if wilbur plays he will start some cult, it would be really cool, cant wait for more videos :D
Tommy, do you know there are more boss that is stronger than the battle tower golem?

1:26 jschlat: *am i having a heart attack?*  me: *flashbacks at dream smp*
Tommy I love your videos them are funny 😂
jschlatt=herbrine cannon
So no one is going to talk about the giorno theme intro?
Fuckworld....and “the other one”
They should definitely use this mod as like an smp or something (I dunno, I just think that’d be cool)
is no one gonna mention jshaltt lesbian growling
0:26 never expected giorno's theme "a suprise but a pleasant one"
Road to 10 million subs
Tommy said that he doesn't like anime and he plays jojo
you opoenings and thumb nails are cringe
I can tell you got a new editor. This video was way longer and seems different
man the D2 music is hitting different
To play rl craft you need flint and sticks you can get in gravel and leaves and then make flint knife break grass and you get a  Plant fiber after that you need to craft a plant fiber string to make flint axe and then break tree have fun
7:49 jumpscare
Congrats on #1 for trending yes

12:52 "WATCH OUT FUCKWORLD!" LMAO- I CANT✋😭😭😭
Wow so hard😤
Please make another episode of this, same group, same mod this was definitely my favourite one yet
Tbh I thought you where lying about the unsub glitch BUT YOUR RIGHT
Finally, a Tommyinnit video isn't the funniest video ever
24:40 when he said let me down  Is it just me or did he sound like Harry Potter
Congratulations on 9million you’ve come a long way
I'm so proud of tommy, as a londoner, i can safely say, that now he has said the words 'mans got a shank',  tommyinnit  truly knows british slang.
Tommy is kinda late
RIP Fuckworld
I saw philza and jcshlatt hexxit series,this is nostalgic as hell
Hey um....wtf
I want them to fight the 3 endgame bosses of RLCraft if you dont know they are the (Rahovart, Asmodeus, and Amalgalich) tbh they are pretty easy to defeat if you have the righy stuff
I remembered there was a depressed 15 years old that smokes too much here
I just love he uses jojo music

Top 10 Saddest anime deaths 1. Fuckworld and other wolf
Tommy: hates weebs Also Tommy: uses a JoJo Theme
The destiny 2 music hits hard....
I lost it when jschlatt started chanting lmao-
hi
dude that intro music was pog, not sure what its from tho
The house was evolving    *just backwards*
rip fuckworld 2021-2021
THERE'S THAT SOMETHING ABOUT SCHLATT GOING "I got dogs! :D" TO ME THAT MAKES MY HEART GO HSJDBNZNS✨  ohp now he's sacrificing jambo to the pope, welp, welp, this is going good
Ok Tommy used Destiny 2 music I’m happy now.
why was this so funny
One of the hardest not the hardest.
It’s so funny how fuckworld and the other dog dies and then there is just Destiny 2 music in the background
Giornio's theme in da beginning made me happy
"i need to upgrade my mouth" BEST THING IVE HEARD LMFAO
Are we gonna ignore how tommy and Charlie's raps were actually decent
love the jojo music
Or just play Terraria 1.4 normally on Master mode with the "for the worthy" seed It's also harder than RLCraft
Would definitely watch more of these
Dam tommyinnt is about to pass coryxkenshin
Plz part 2
I can't believe this the the first time u played Rlcraft
26:40 Final boss
This video was hilarious
Tommy: we did it The real boss: oh really?
POV: You are Human
i heard JOJO ?
I would love it if they did a hexxit series like Phil and Schlatt
But what does that mean?
19:29 ok but that was actually fire tho wtf
How is no one talking about the use of Journey from Destiny 2
can already see the dream speedrun
This was really fun!!!! The timing of some cuts were just perfect, I laughed a lot :D
I wanna see an entire series of this

Why are you filming with a racist?
tommy this was absolutely poggers and I swear upon the lord himself that I almost busted a lung laughing because of how epically hilarious this video was I expect more videos such as this to come  In high regards, a viewer/subscriber
Series?
WE LOVE FUCKWORLD haha yesssss big mansss
I don't know who was possessed by the god of sadomasochistic idiocy to make a mod like this under the assumption that anything in it would be any decent player's idea of fun. Tommy, you have ALL of my respect just for being willing to not immediately leave when you learned about the nature of the damn thing.
Tbh this would be funnier if Wilbur was there
This movie had every single emotions 👍
las drogas
rip fuckworld

Pogggg 1 TRENDINNNN

BIG T
This isn’t 1 mod. It’s a modpack. Literally called RLCraft. Which is filled with other mods. I hope people know this.
Next time play Terraria Calamity mod on Death mode or Terraria Fargo's mod on Eternity mode RLCraft is NOTHING compared to them
Rip fuckworld and the other one too i guess

The colossal zone mathematically heat because separated thoracically walk down a fortunate weapon. foregoing, arrogant sleet
6:26 schlatt's face still has me laughing
I like how he’s acting like he never played this before just to make it seam more intended and whatever when he literally played it with boffy
i can’t believe tommy is at 9 mil already. it’s like it was yesterday when he had 100k. congratulations on all the success!!!
Man, don't you hate it when there's some video in your ads :/
me casually playing rlcraft at the same time as tommy

I should've looked at the thumbnail earlier, I WOULD'VE COMING SPEEDRUNNING OVER, this mod is one of my favourite mods and I can not express how happy I am, my serotonin is out the roof with this  Ah fuck there's no actual dragons or dragon armour god damnit-

30 minutes of TommyInnit? F*CK YEAH
schlatt sacrificing jambo is amazing and him screaming at the grim reaper ITS ALSO AMAZING
and i thought crazy craft was hard
Tommy: Hates Anime Also Tommy: Giorno's theme for epic intro
Schlatt: Why are church bells ringing?  "Can't you hear that, Schlatt? I'm the chosen one! It means I'm a god."
3:52 *picks up stick* "i'm gonna go have some fun" is it just me or...
His intro somehow gave me nostalgia
It severely pissed me off when tommy went to the orange bed instead of the red one 😂
Tommy and Jschlatt: **plays rlcraft with Charlie** Slimecicle: **RLCRAFT FLASHBACKS**
Fuck world
I love your videos as much as my girlfriend 😂
Oh you remembered you have YouTube channel nice
anybody want to see sadist make a animation of them fighting the boss that would be sick tbh
The last time I heard Schlatt scream like that was "The Scariest Wii Game Ever" holy shit lol
*Me waiting for Tommy to play with Boffy again*
Anyone remember when he did this with Boffy? Or just me
Tommy content started to get boring  :(
r.i.p fuckworld
0:26 jojo?
*3 idiots play rl craft*
Jschlatt and JoJo theme remix? SIGN ME THE FUCK UP!
18:45 honestly fire
I Enjoyed the video. RLcraft is no joke. the fact you got as far as you did speak to your skill.

If it starts with JoJo music y'know it's gonna be good :)
Nobody talking about Tommy using jojo songs for his intro?     Nobody? Ok
I love even Charlie's gibberish is subtitled🤣
Truly disgusting the some “title” would do this horrible thing
**Schlatt gets struck by lightning** Tommy : What the Fuck is happening ? Charlie : I think God Was Affronted by him **Schlatt sacrificing his Cat to God**
The flat foam ontogenetically bruise because nitrogen complimentarily knot excluding a helpful custard. grouchy, squeamish sink

Yo destiny 2 journey music when fuckworld died
There is actually a harder version, the rlcraft hardcore config by shivaxi. It's not just hardcore it's HARDCORE, like every monster hits harder, less hearts and all that. There's a video on yt of someone playing it by "casually"
finally
Okay but Jschlatt praying to the pope after getting struck by lighting was so funny
Half of the video : CHARLIE CHARLIE!
I love your videos
I mite not watch you but I still want to get you to 10 mill

YESS!!! #1 TRENDING FOR GAMING!!
Tommy if you are reading this I would love a tommyinnit style 100 day videos.
Who remembers when Tommyinnit did this with Boffy?
I like how in the beginning he’s like what is this mod but he already played it
“You do not meet the requirements to survive”
Noooooo fuckworld ;-;            And the other one too                RIP

To be honest if Tommy made this a small survival series I would definitely watch it where maybe each video had like a challenge that they had to complete as like a challenge against each other (like if you agree)
11:33 wait till those KAM girls cancel him
His name was f*ckworld and he is dead, I don't have enough skill to eat this bread - tommyinnit the rapper

RIP The Other One the wolf.  You may have been ignored, but you won’t be forgotten... 😔
I liked the giorno in the start of the vid
Tommy: theres a pressure plate Schlatt: its for the door dumbass 2:04                  Few minutes later: dies from stepping on a pressure plate 16:34
charlie: i need to upgrade my mouth  me: tHat'S wHat ShE saID!
Weeks ago i was thinking about tommy making a video about this mod. I guess the prophecy is true i guess, or i mean tommy makes vids about alot of mods so i guess it was finally time.
The "dog speaking Spanish" is such a good reference.
*9.1 million subs* “Guys we are so close to 10 million!!!”
wait didnt u already played this mod? or im jus trippin?
All the way from 2012
Charlie's RT craft video was so funny, it's hilarious watching him try to lead Tommy and Schlatt through it and suffer again.
I hear my call    This anime song it calls me     Giorno theame ahh very nice
Tommy: Punches Schlatt Schlatt: My left arm and chest are yellow. Am I having a heart attack? My mind: Dream SMP vibes
Make this a series

Hey tommy try to convince dream to convince dream to play rlcraft

Jzjasb- Schlatt sacrificing Jambo to the Pope is incredible-
POV: you thought this was an old video because of his face in the thumbnail.

F for Fuckworld :,(
Hey Tommy! If you don't mind can you lay off the god jokes? I don't mind them that much, it just offends me a little. I don't have any problems with you or anyone in this video. It's just the jokes. Again no you or anyone else! Just the jokes. Lol. (You're all my favorite YouTubers 💝)
I lost it when schlatt started praying and offering sacrifices-
Try orespawn, it's bosses are insane
Tommy's channel is growing faster than any Asian person I know, _that includes me_
Tommy i think you should actually use the chisel mod 🤔🤔
"Please enjoy this video, BECAUSE WE DID NOT" me : well that was unexpected
I LOST IT WHEN JSHLATT OFFERED THE POPE JAMBO
I knew that this is a good bideo because of the intro. Ps the song is giorno's theme
WHY WAS GEORGENOTFOUND ONLY FANS PLAYING IN THE BACKROUND
What are these ads Thomas???
Let's Goooooooo 9 mil

I watched Calvin play this, it didn't seem nearly as crazy then.
Giornos theme in the background
The thing that confuses me is that out of all people tommy tried the most
Tommy got the bars though
Are ya excited Tommy for your "DIAMOND" play button?
I can imagine charlie getting ptsd during this playthrough
They should make a shirt that’s says rip fuckworld and have a picture of fuckworld there
I remember one of my friends and I grinded this for hours during class
PLEEEAAASSSE do more RL craft!!!!
Grey among us.
I enjoyed this video a lot tommy I would like be to see more but don’t push yourself and make sure to eat and drink water and rest ❤️❤️😁

You should credit the person who made a mod like this
hello and This video is cool and funny
15:36 the fact that they used cuphead as background music really made this 1000% funnier.
PART 2 PLSSSSSS
I love swearing too
:)
1 like is 1 sub more
Tommyinnit: this is the hardest mod  Boss music in the background: bonjour
Tommy Can you play with schlatt more?
The way SCHLATT kisses soup
Charlie is in the dream smp
It took me a minute to figure out where the opening was familiar from, then i realized, Charlies video from last year, Natural Disaster Mod, same opening
we were all confused when tommy didn't upload on Friday don't deny it
You know shits about to go down when you hear Giorno's theme as the intro-
(Hears starting song) Is that.... Is it..... (GETS LOUDER) *le gasp* IT IS
Tommy’s rap at 19:21 was absolutely amazing he popped off! Pog
When Tommy plays Giorno music: _"Something weird has happened to your channel..." "You hear..." "Speedrunning YT music..."_
I love how Jschlatt just sacrifices Jambo with no hesitation
Well done mate, I can't belive you've grown your chanel so much! I remember you on twitch when you had 800 views ❤️
Tommy I have an idea. You should probably make an ocean monument base in the dream smp. You'll be king of the ocean.
When Tommy's intro starts with a Jojo reference :flushed:
Nice one
We only have one goal!!!!: precedes to list 2 goal?
Looks like the child almost hit 10M subs v_v Congrats

Props for the jojo music at 0:04

Hi
Hey Tommy can you survive 200 days in RLcraft?
Ok here's a little post that I hope can help you guys! I don't even know if you'll SEE IT but I've been playing rlcraft for fun for a bit and thought you might enjoy a few quick tips here! Please like this so tommy might have a CHANCE of seeing it!  This is just beginner stuff, if you want a late game one later I'd love to make one for you guys!   Biggest things and how to deal with them:  Dragons!  HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM: Dragons stick in a certain proximity to their nest. Fire dragon nests have gold in them, and Ice dragons have silver. If you go underground and find a dragon nest, be warned! That is a level five! level five dragons are the one dragon type that will NOT stay by their nests once they are woken up! Level five dragons are the only ones that have a chance of dropping DRAGON EGGS! You can raise them, but I would suggest saving that for late game! BASICALLY! Do not go near nests unless you can speed the fuck out of there. They will be alerted if you break their gold, so I'd just avoid them until late game.   SEASONS!  NEED TO KNOW: Seasons aren't exactly something you beat, because they're going to beat you. Once winter comes, you're kinda f*cked if you don't have a way of keeping yourself warm! The easiest way is to wear wool armor and sit next to a campfire for a while. Otherwise, in mid-late winter, you will freeze to death every time you go outside. (I would suggest making a season clock to help tell what season it is) CROPS! Certain crops are only able to be grown in certain seasons! The crops and their various seasons are as follows:  SPRING: Carrots and Potatoes  SUMMER: Melon, Sugarcane, and Wheat  AUTUMN: Beetroot, Carrot, Pumpkin, and Wheat.  Saplings, flowers, and ferns grow in every season  MOST HELPFUL THINGS TO HAVE/KNOW ABOUT IN RLCRAFT:  SUMMONING STAFF! Bone, gold, eye of ender! thats all you need for a summoning staff! One of the most OP weapons in rlcraft. It can be used to summon mobs to fight for you! Press B to go into the menu, it's all very straightforward. I HIGHLY suggest getting one of these and leveling up your magic to use it.  Backpacks! there is a mod installed that gives you a backpack! You can put items in it, though it does replace your chest plate. When you die, your items will not despawn if they have been put inside the backpack. Its a very helpful item to have as you can craft them and carry them with you anywhere, as well as being able to place them and use them as chests!  Healing items! Bandages and shit are pretty useful if you're just going on a quick expedition, or on a perilous trip into the mines! Certain healing items can be held and just used on different body parts, or just held and used to heal overall body health. Keep your head on your shoulders, bois! If your head gets hit three times, your entire body is down for the count!  WEAPONS! There is a mod installed that gives you different weapons with different uses, I would say the best one is the halberd, as it does ASSLOADS of damage and has good reach! Also, if you use a two handed weapon with a shield, your attack speed will be very much so impaired! (u fight slow)  COMPANIONS *VERY IMPORTANT!*  When I say companions I mean pets and mounts that you can have! I saw you guys lose fuckworld, and I thought you might want to know about this stuff if you keep any more pets.  SOULSTONES! A soulstone is made by using a soulgazer, four eyes of ender, and four diamonds. A soulgazer can be used more than once to make more soulstones, but a soulstone can only be used ONCE on a tamed mob! I am telling you how to make a stone before how to tame, because in RLCRAFT it's foolish to go and tame a creature without having a soulstone to bind it! The reason being, once a creature is bound it can be revived/ summoned even after it dies over and over- after a cool down of about two minutes, of course. Soulstones can be used on pets and mountable creatures!  TAMING: You must make different treats depending on what you are trying to tame! The best mounts in the game are the morock and the roc, as they are tamable FLYING creatures and make travel a lot easier! As well as making it so you can fight large creatures from long range, and shoot battletower golems RIGHT OFF THEIR TOWERS! Rocs are the easiest and most common. You just need avian treats and a saddle! (SADDLES CAN BE CRAFTED). Once you have tamed it, use your soulstone and boom! Eternal companion!! You can also put chests on them and use them as storage that you can summon at will!   The best armor in the game is seaserpent armor, by the by. Seaserpents are vicious beasts, though! So be wary!   Battletowers are the best way to get loot quickly, so if you defeat the golem up top everything will breakdown.   NETHER IS NOT WORTH IT IN MY OPINION. JUST DEATH THERE.   final quick tips!  Enchant, enchant, enchant!  Dynamic trees can break your fall if you jump on to them!  JEI (just enough items) can tell you how to craft anything you could possibly want!    I hope this helps y'all! If you even see it!   Have a great day, and don't let rlcraft beat ya down! YOU GOT THIS!
Rlcraft is not too hard ngl
I have actually never laughed harder. All of your videos are hillarious like you say. But this one is by far the funniest. I am already saying this and I havent even gotten 8 minutes in yet. 100 day of this... that would be AMAZING

Schlatt: I fell through the floor Tommy: *becomes English teacher* But what does that M E A N ?
I love the very silent giorno Giovanna song in the background in the beginning of the video
Congrats on 9mil
To everyone readingg this: I don’t know what happens in your life, but don’t be hard on yourself; love never hurts someone but a wrong person does. Don’t be sad. Stay smile. Don’t allow wrong people to ruin your life. Go ahead. These fluctuations are the part of life!
When Schlatt becomes emotionally attached to a pixelated dog named Fuckworld in a block game
tommy "Today we only had one goal: to defeat the dungeon boss..."  me knowing the fishing rod flying mount strat and the agis rapier strat
this was so funny when I could hardly breathe :)
NOT JAMBO
Poggers
Pff p' ch p.... p' ch Pff p' ch p.... p' ch  His name was fuckworld and now he's dead he couldn't make it into the bed  how did he die? It was the vibra mala? No stupid he tried to swim in lava
More R.L.Craft
Rlcraft is really easy
hey Tommy, this video is #1 trending for gaming. You really are the best MC player :) Congrats!!!
You had me dying🤣🤣🤣🤣 this is so funny we need another one
this is just "Tommy shlatt and charlie get traumatised" the mod
Schlatt: Am I having a heart attack? Me: oh not again
E
Anyone else get emotionally attached to fuckworld
This is already really funny but if it was proximity chat it would be amazing
Tommy’s editor: adds destiny music as a sad theme  Also tommy : “lets destroy the tower”
BARS
23:36 can we talk about how smooth this was
Tommy i am your big fan
The  jojo  theme  tho
I like how editor larry was brave enough to put gibberish at 6:21
FUCK WORLD BABY!
⊑⟟ ⏁⍜⍜⋔⊬
Youtubers always claim that youtube is unsubbing people but in reality, it's because they've become cringe and people no longer like their videos.
Every JoJo loves this video because it has giorno theme
I’m still wondering if TommyInnit is still trying to impress that women
"PICK UP THE FCKING KNIFE" -Tommyinnit 2021
THE JOJO MUSIC IS EVERYTHING JSJSJSJ
#1 on trending Pog :)
Why 😂 wtf is jsclatt offering his cat to god as a sacrifice do you udnerstand how strange that is
1# for gaming !!!
Hah this is nothing I beat this mod in 19 hours in hardcore in my 3 try killed every boss I cried in relief when I finished
Charlie is getting flashbacks
RIP fuckworld and the other one
this is honestly one of the most funniest mod videos imo because the reactions are all so GENUINE. their panic, schlatt's frustration because the wolves died.. or when he encountered the reaper, went to sleep, woke up relieved and then screamed in terror because it came back + charlie's actual stress and worry at the start + many of tommy's fear-filled screams
HEEYYYY TOMMY☝🏼😰
Aye Tommy craft a saber and a rapier
TOMMY IS GONNA HIT 10 MILLION
Giorno Theme, nice
Dun dun dadadadadaaddaad dun dun dadadad
The dream smp should play crazy craft
When Tommy strucks by lightning: Proceeds on what they are doing before, When Jschlatt strucks by lightning: Offers his pet to god.
Congrats for the 9.1M subs :)
"I survived minecrafts hardest mod"      *Dies in the first 10 minutes
The destiny music around when fuckworld died, heart strings man
I’ve been subbed since 1mill
F**kworld and the other one  2021-2021 😔✋
oh you did this with boffy too
He just has a lot of dangerous mods and animation
boss go brr
"WhAt ThE h3Ll"
NO ONE HARED JOHO MYSIC IN THE BACKROUBD
I had it once
Dude, this is so fun...I remember the series Captain sparklez did of rlcraft.
Legend has it, tommy is still falling from the bird of prey.
Rlcraft is not a mod it is a modpack
Slimecicle: *Panick*
i love the two ex-lunch club members and then tommy
RIP fuck world
Please do this again!
Tyat boss i could just fishing it rod out when i build up the tower
Shlatt: am I having a heart attack??  *he remembers...*
I support part 2
“I’m gonna break...😿” - Charlie
He want joking when he said this was the hardest recording ever
Imagine being a day late
This is now canon to the Slimecicle cinematic universe (SCU). My theory is that Charlie and his friends prayed to god for help in this horrific rlcraft world and then Schlatt became god. After that Schlatt abused his powers in the every 5 minutes there’s a natural disaster video Charlie did and the rest of the plot is history.
survived my ass
Help Tommy  to 10M subs
MAKE A PART 2 PLEASSE
I can picture this being real life, Like u guys are in a adventure-
Top 10 saddest anime deaths: 1. fuckworld 2. the other one
26:08 tag yourself. Im that one skeleton just standing there
this is the most chaotic thing i've seen all day my brain hurts and i'm dying of laughter
100 day RL CRAFT. DOOO IT!!!!
Imagine having to upgrade your mouth to eat,this post was posted by a child that was already maxed level at eating at an early age for a reason I don't know gang
Jschlatt: "This skeleton has a trumpet-"  Me: *San-*
Does anyone remember how Tommy played this mod with Boffy?
Please do more RL Craft because this was hilarious
His name was fuckworld and he is dead  *Schlatt crying*  I dont have enough skill to eat this bread
i feel like you've played this before with boffy 2 years ago
It is official Tommy is a web 😂😂😂😂😂
I miss Wilburrrrr
When schlatt asked if he was having a heart attack it almost gave me one
0:17 sus KSI at the right And tommy screaming AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH And congrats for 9m subs And yeah this video is not seriously its just more fun 🤣🤣
Get aztrosist on with ya, will be funny as FCK
Lmao tho hundred days in rlcaft it really is a great mod, and possibly with calvin but thats ur choice lol hes good at rlcraft
Schlatt is just praying 🤣
Wow hes like... 2 years late
Again he does Giorno's Theme :/
hi tommy i can relate im 11 im a kid
The entirety of this video is then 3 just going: ‘WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT???!!!
You just past techno in subs lezgo
Why the f*ck did I tear up when Fuckworld died?
Series Innit...?
MonkE
His was fuck world now he is dead, I don’t have enough skill to eat this bread.
Jschlatt is pog
I am a rlcraft nerd and also a rlcraft expert and I was literally pissing through out this video
Make an RLCraft series please :P

Rip fuck world 🛐 Rip the other one 😒
tommy please go back to skyblock for your og fans
Nobody tell him about the rod glitch
Fuckworld: Dies  Everyone: * starts beatboxing *
The giorno theme got me tho-
HES USING DESTINY 2 MUSIC HES USING JOURNEY FT. KRONOS QUARTET DONT ASK HOW I KNOW I JUST DO
11:04
O only defeat a dungeon boss others defeat a dragon
The second Charlie said that Schlatt is fluent in Spanish I just flashbacked to the Treaty of Versailles.
I remember this but you and boffy
o7 to fuckworld
The fact that this was all for fuckworld is worth living
whyd you stop playing with boffy :(
Charlie slimecicle is so wise
then why you dont tame the dragon ???
29:54 that look of Charlie was like Annabelle looking at me
The Giorno theme just made it better
Play more of this
Tommy my man here’s the real reason why people are unsubscribed or and a ing to the word I just said is because you can only subscribe to a limited amount of people trust me I have a LOT of channels subscribed too
no one:  Schlatt: My left arm is damaged.   Am I having a heart attack?
Where tf is technoblade with his teaser
Me forgetting to watch a video. Me 5 years later: well fu##
Yesssaaaa Jojo theme song
FUCKWORLD
Yeet
I absolutely wouldn't mind a series of this. I've never seen those three that invested in, well, anything. And it's a blast to watch!
6:55
dungeon boss looks like my mom  :《
R.i.p f#ckworld and other one
Only legends remember the original rlcraft tommy did with boffy

Wait, why does the title not have the word FUNNIEST in it!?!?!?! Something is amiss I swear…..
THE GIRONNO THEME HIT HATD
Hey
“I’m not skilled enough to heal myself.”  Charlie Slimecicle - 2021
I looked and it’s on number one trending my mouth dropped
We Will Give You 10Million Subscribes But After 10Million You Will Do Jojo Pose
9/10 nice jokes but my ears are bleeding please level your audio. now that I think about it loud = funny so keep at it my guy
I really liked Tommy RLCraft videos. He should make more and continue the journey.
This video:*exists*  SAD-ist:stonks
I am going to cry
make it  a series
i honestly cannot tell if schlatt was actually screaming in fear at 7:37
Schlatt mentioning the Hexxit series he played with Phil gave me so much seratonin. We got slight references to a lot of things in this video — Anime voice camp and Schlatt's dream smp death being the main ones I can recall now lmao.
What is the version
What was the intro song
Schlatt: Am I having a heart attack?  Every DreamSMP watcher: *flashbacks*
"Hey there beautiful-" *"-you don't have a face.."*
"now I'm gonna eat it's *meat* "
TOMMY SPITTIN BARS
It's not the hardest mod By the way (My opinion). Have you tried Forever Stranded?
ALMOST AT 10M YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Simp for noone
JOJO
Amazing video!
The wolf died kuz he dint respown
fuckworld the dog rapper
More more more more rlcraft rn I’ll give you 1 week
Real ones will remember when he played this with boffy
This is #1 on gaming! Im so proud :D
this is the longest video i have ever seen on tommys channel
Charlie has clear PTSD from this mod and it's hilarious
7:36when my dad pulls out the belt
Did anyone else freaking lose it when they heard Journey play at 17:07? Also, did anyone notice how smooth the transition was between the song before and then Journey?
I really like how editor censors swearing at the start but gave up doing so because of overwhelming amount of swearing.
Early >:) lol
Congrat TommyInnit. You just get 9.1million subscriber.
Wooo!!!! Poggg🐛💗💗
No one: Not even the autistic kid: Schlatt: _Offers his cat to god_
POV: It feels like it was just yesterday tommy was at 7 mil
Is Giorno's theme Copyrightable or is it just me
FUN FACT≥ if you put :fun fact: SOMEONE WELL READ YOUR WHOLE COMMENT
I like how Tommy is now using Giorno's theme in his intros.
Ay trumpet skeleton=sans the skeleton
this video was awesome
17:57 Dudes been practicing ever since that on SBI episode O. O
Poggers

Okay but editor Larry’s the editing tho
The real question is,      *did you really survive tho*
I’m EARLY YES
3:18 lol
For the new people who are wondering why Youtube keeps on doing weird things like 99%, 101% polls and unsubsribe people, that is because Youtube is drunk

The only beat that white people know is the infamous "pff pf ch pff pf ch"
YES GIORNO THEME
I love that Schlatt is in the videos

Charlie foreshadowing the death of fuckworld is pretty amazing...

1# for gaming good job Tommy know u are a man

Part of the reason tommy is such a terrible rapper is because all of his raps start with  “My name is tommyinnit and I’m here to say…”
RIP Fuck World
jojo music?
TOMMY POPPED OFF
I remember when you did this with boffy that was so funny
Rlcraft series would be cool ngl
“His name is f***world and he is dead, I dont have any skill to eat this bread”😂😂😂

Happy 9m idol 😄

*queue the flashbacks to Charlie’s first time on RLCraft*
U liked it
This is easy tommy just  use creative bitch
To tell you I was choking laughing through at least half of the video would be an understatement
Well, I thought 'hardcore' is the hardest mode, but after watching this..
This was not 1000% funnier
I think we all learnt a valuable lesson from this video. Fuck World man.... Fuck World
May fuckworld and less important dog rest in peace
comfort video
Rip fridai-ly videos xD
I have something important to say.                                                                          Lol
This a jojo reference?
Charlie sounds like he had Vietnam war flashbacks when playing this
tommy : i hate anime intro : giorno's theme
hes almost at 10M
THE INTRO'S MUSIC IS JJBA POGGERS
THE JOJO MUSIC
I still remember that girl you mentioned... good luck with her and 10 mil Tommy!
this was inevitable
GET TOMMY TO 10 MILLION
HAHAHAHAHAHA THIS IS SO COOL TOMMY
When at 17:06 you know what game the sad music is from.
Charred by piano
Dude #1 trending on Asia. Lets goooooo🤩🤩🤩
Elodie my beloved (✿ ♡‿♡)(✿ ♡‿♡)
Almost to ten mil big man!!! Keep it up, and good luck!!!!!
JOJO SONG?!! NO WAY, IM GONNA SUB NOW BEACUSE YOU PUT JOJO SONG FOR THE INTRO SONG
Giornos theme plays in the start:  Me: so this is what we are dealing with
If you make this a series, I’ll sub with the 9,000 accounts I made for pewdiepie vs tserise. No 🧢
This was what first experience was like Screams pain and agony it was amazing
tommy put anime music behind the vid after saying he hates anime pog
Hey Tommy make this a series
im so proud of tommy he’s literally at almost 10  mil
The intro reminds me of Tommy’s older video intros
Has tommy got into anime recently? 🤔
One day late
One of the most interesting video I've ever seen.
Tommy 2 years ago playing RLcraft with Boffy: no knowledge Tommy now playing RLcraft with Schlatt and Charlie: still no knowledge
Jshalt: Cuddles with cat Jshalts mind: Fuck
Rip fuckworld  Rip the other one
Hey beautifu-u dont have a face
I am not a gnoblin I am not a gnelf I am a gnekk
Awesome
I like how that Tommy sensors the curse words in the first 30 seconds of the video and just straight up say “nah ima leave these curse words here”
Next time they should do the ender dragon in Rlcraft
ez mod ever
This reminded me of when Phil and schlatt played rlcraft together :)
i miss fuckworld
5:09 me hitting on a girl
try to beat asmodeus
Bro I remember when you where at 500k and less
Yes I guess I’m kinda early cause it has been five hours :D
29:53 what even was that smile 😭
Tommy putting up the rip signs for jshlatts dogs: *rip fuckworld*............. *rip...... the other one* I LAUGHED SO HARDD
17:16 I see why tommy chose the chicken origin
Play again and get dragon egg and name fuck drago
Caption i “survive” literally the first 5 min died
*Jumanji song intensifies*
Ayo Giorno's theme!!
Why isn't technoblade here if he was he could show that technoblade never dies lol
the music when fuckworld died is from Destiny 2. that gives me nostalgia man...
Part 2 pls
We need the old squad back and Pls we miss our philza quackity and wilbur pls Tommy pls.
no
#1 baybee!!!!!
jschlatt :IM STUCK IN THE WALL wall titans:FIRST TIME
pew
It's Giorno's theme at the start!
i like how people didnt notice the jojo song remix
Bruh I just watched the video you did with Boffy like an entire year ago Omg
*epic boss music intensifies*
Hi
Tommy actually completed a challenge
Damn forgot how many bots are on popular YouTubers channels
Comment
now the question we're left to ask ourselves is did they catch him
I love your content your so funny
petition for them to start an smp with this mod
Jojo music top tier.
why so tommy so good at this I died before I even got the chance to sleep
Bro Jschlatt screaming at the reaper is the single best thing ever
Do paleocraft
he played this with boffy a few years ago and hes acting like he doesnt know
ok who’s gonna tell him about the music or-
MORE MORE MORE please
Music at the start of the video  Giorno's theme
tommy can you do a part 2?
I think tommy finally reached the top of his subscriber pleateau
I play RL Craft and it is very hard
Tommy youre way too loud, I mean also in general, but in this instance I mean the edditing buddy
can u do a siereis
lol
More rlcraft videos pls
Charlie needs more credit
The good question is tho.. does tommyinnit even watch jojo’s bizarre adventure since he’s playing jojo music so much
I've literally been getting BRITISH ADS from watching Tommyinnit : )
Tommyinnit & Boffy RLCraft flashbacks
Can you do Ice and Fire dragons mod and fight a level 5 dragon or do MO' creatures. It would be funny for either of them
This is definitely my new favorite video 😂
I live the jojo remix song
6:12 can someone actually tell me what’s wrong with Charlie’s mouth?
Since when did tommy start censoring his vids
Ah yes....a jojo theme
what's the mod called?
Editor Larry giving that Jojo reface
the jojo XD  got me XDDDDDDD
I'm just saying make Tommyinnit to 10MIL.
1 more million Tommy then you will be able to impress that girl 😏
I'm excited for the new gayshlatt meme. ( 11:36 ) This one just really blurred the line for me.
Play more
Tommy’s thoughts: MUST GET  10MILL
you did this with boffy
schlatt had to sit there and hear his two comrades die without being able to do anything...   Rest in peace fuck world...and the other one.  you were loved.
i don't think you really survived...
16:28 is the moment JSchlatt loses it all!
Another Jojo reference
That please enjoy the video because we did not became an instant classic goddammit
the fact that schlatt's weakness is animals is very nice
Tommy this was great
Ok if you make a video try not to say the f word
nope 🤣
Make this a series
6:38  Me at 3 am talking to myself
tommy be spiitin heat
I swear I am the only one who heard Schlatt moan??? :')
💜I really enjoy this cuz it's very funny i have been play this mod before and noting was that hard just meh i din't even play mincraft that much im incredable noob at mine craft but atleast i know how to play and survive yeah....💜
This was an amazing video. I would love to see more videos like this!
I love your content SOOOOO MUCH
Slimecicle raps like he was in hamilton
I expect Fundy to comment on this saying his mod is harder.
you would be a leo, wouldnt you
F for fuck world
Rip fuck world
mod name pls?
Is it just me but Charlie look shirtless because his whiteness matched the t-shirt
9 mil..POGGERS
Those subtitles are genius
I want an episode 2.
Basically a rage/horror game
1V1 SNEEG
4:29 that is a fucking demogorgin
ME AND MY FRIENDS DID THIS OMG
This is like a movie 😎
#tommyinit 10 mill
I love the music when the intro it is so good
My Face After Passing The Exam: 29:54
Bro where is boofy
Hey there beautiful- You don’t have a face.       I think we offended God Schlatt:**praises God**
I like that they used the song "journey" from Destiny 2 for Fuck Worlds death.
1:26 *Dream SMP Flashbacks*
Noice! Always wanted to play this, can't though, don't have access to a pc about 95% of the time, and when I do, I can't get mc on it...
I would love a 100 days in hardcore by Tommyinnit😂
I want to see dream play this
Tommy almost 10 Mill Holy shit
Mmm this looks a lot like RL craft
This is *hilarious* omg. The end was literal perfection *chefs kiss*
Charlie being the experienced one is so amazing here. I could relate to him so much throughout the whole video as he’s just trying to lead 2 people to a slightly less possible death
The iconic TommyInnit intros are back!
Is it just me or is Tommy gonna look kinda like Gordon Ramsey when he's older
Tommy finally uses il vento d'oro me who is fan of jojo:yessssssssssssssssssssss
Oh my god i have the same mod as u :)
Yeeeees  rlcraft pog Edit: the dungeon boss isnt the only boss
It kind of sad how some people can survive a 100 days in this
HOW DID YOU GO BACK DOWN TO 9.1 M? and yes I 100% enjoyed it! But if you didn’t, no I did not like this video💛
I like how Phil and Schlatt beat the same boss (although in a different mod pack) in hardcore then kept going on after it and the whole objective of this video is to beat it.
Am I the only one that started crying when the dogs died
tommys still using golden wind music what a jojo reference
I remember when tommy plays this mod with boffy
Where is Philza
Tommy is a Jojo fan lol
Tommymods war
Jschlatt is affiliated with god
I vote to make this a series
IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE INTRO MUSIC—
issit just me or does Charlie's second rap sound like something from theodd1sout....
Am I the one hyped about golden wind?
Jschlatt: Eat this cake.   Slimesicle: I have to upgrade my mouth.  Me when in 9 years old: Mouth level 9999999999
Gonna be honest I thought Charlie was shirtless for half the videos lmao 😂
Jschlatt: Eat this cake.   Slimesicle: I have to upgrade my mouth.  Me when in 9 years old: Mouth level 9999999999
Dude for a second I thought my music broke and I started listening to it but it was just Destiny 2 “Journey” 17:08
RIP Fuckworld 😔
I just woke up  ;-;
Ooooooh half an hour HERE WE GOOOOO
I remember when Tommy and Boffy played Rlcraft together, they always die lol
HOLY SHIT IS THAT JOJO REFFERENCE!?

congrats on 9 mil big man soon it'll be 10mil
Respect for using a song from destiny for the death of fuck world
It so hard and not that easy that we need to press shift to pick something
not so early gang
HOLY
is it just me or does slimecicle’s room remind anyone of dantdm’s old one?
I cant believe you took out the swears😥
Giornos theme hitting hard
I don't think "survived" is the word I would use to describe your experience with this mod.
Finally, a video without "Funniest" or "Funny in its title
I hope getting #1 on trending is enough for Tommy to make another one because this was 1000% funny
pls i need more slimeicle raps
just to be blunt, he in fact did not survive minecraft's hardest mod
i REALLY liked this video it would be pretty cool if you do end up doing the 100 day videos. this group was really funny :)
Noooooooo fuckword!!!
Is this a JoJo reference?
Schllats cat: bro wtf who is that
Part 2 would be fun, I would like to see it.
Master mode Terraria players: Amateurs.
PART 2
This was amazing! Also... I think Charlie is a bit traumatized from playing so much of the Village...
Ayeeeeee he hit 9 mil lets gooooooo
why was he acting so surprised he did a whole thing with boffy
This is agony, knowing what to do, but can’t do anything about it like help tommy get his defense and attack up, and telling him about the village
4:25 man that's the demogargon
1st trending wow!
Kinda sounds like a another video
Is tommy becoming a jojo fan???
Tommy has effectively ruined his upload schedule
RIP fuckworld
Why do you always use giorno theme
10 Mil MAKE A TOMMYSMP
I woke up my parents by laughing so hard.

You should continue and try to kill a bigger boss

Slimecicle: “ I could not tell you but im pretty sure God was affronted by something we said.. “ Jschlatt: *proceeds to slowly turn around to look at the cardboard cut-out behind him and pray profusely, sacrificing his cat*

Tommy got a knife and all of a sudden, he's 1000% more powerful.
Hey big man Tommy you should play Reident Evil Villiage (8)
There's a glitch to defeat the dungeon boss
They don’t make very much progress without Phil if you know what I mean.
You have more subs than technoblade
"His name was f*ckworld and now he is dead, I don't have enough skill to eat this bread" ok but rapper arc tommy??? edit: LMAO CHARLIE TOO AND THEN "were going to die."

Tommy: OH I've got some crack- krake meat.
You're gonna be disappointed if I tell you that there was 1 more chest at the roof with very good loot.
"It's a chupacabra! They're real!"  Actually, it's a chupacu from goiaininha.  23:17

Can we maybe get this as a series maybe?? Would be pretty cool to watch!
How you even make a server
Your garbage
i love tommy and schlatt together they’re just play so well off eachother
Throw back to when to bofey and tommy played rlcraft
one thing to say bongiorno
I like that whoever edited like the first 5 minutes of this carefully censored out all the swears and then whoever edited the rest of the video just did not care
He's learned to use Giorno's theme, just like slime
Tommy boutta unlock a stand
My God, the beginning and the middle was funny and cool, but I actually liked a lot the rest. This was like a RPG with some kind of ""strategy"" lmao.
I’m just wondering if anyone remembers the hexxit heterosexuals
do this again but use the items you gained from this video, just try to 100% speedrun these things
HIII TOMMY
The music is jayd remix giorno theme if anyone is wondering
1:24 “Am I having a heart attack?”-Schlatt Schlatt..buddy that already happened
slimecicle is a good rapper
17:13  Same dude ik what he means

Tommy: *hates anime* the theme at the beginning: J O J O
Hey there beautiful      OH YOU DON’T HAVE A FACE
Congrats on #1 Trending For Gaming!

Charlie’s PTSD kicking

5:06 "There's a dark nymph here! Hey there beautif- you don't have a face." *sad Tommy noises*

6:37: Jschlatt XD
Charlie: oh it’s coming down does by tree
NOT THE CUPHEAD MUSIC-
Love from India
If philza is there they'll win 20 times
Tommy using giorono theme for intro + epic mod videos = eternal happiness
Can't believe you didn't invite Boffy like last time
Make a series of this or else we will riot
There was a video in your ads
to be fair schlatt could have saved his dog if he respawned instantly
BAHAHHA SHLATT PRAYING
Happy 9.09m subs tommy :)

Schallt: *am i having a heart attack?*  Me: *L’manburg memories*
“Were you inspired by Kanye West?”  Bruhhh 😂😂😂
I have never seen schlatt so emotionally distressed
Next RLCraft video for 10 million subs??
Tommy i think you need to watch @rianiayan because he pro in the rlcraft but he live in indonesian like me
Only reason I subbed and liked was because the Jojo theam
Just realized. Man got more subs than techno
Series ?
Tommy did RLcraft with boffy too right?
A series of this with just you charlie and schlatt would be nice

Hi
Tommy is seriously gaining subs so fast, the only faster sub gainer I can think of is mr beast and dream
Didnt you play this with boffy a while ago
there's a small percent of this video viewers that remember when tommy play rl craft with boffy
It would be hilarious if the dream team did this
what mod is this
dream should speed run this map tbh
RIP Fuckworld 2021-2021
So intense.
Holy shit this is part 2 of schlatts and those towers with Phil, loving this
*ʟᴀᴜɢʜs ɪɴ sᴏᴄᴋsғᴏʀ1 ᴍᴏᴅᴘᴀᴄᴋ*
were almost ten mil? 9.09 patience is key bruh
Bruh, what’s the censorship?
Is that a jojo’s reference
You're laughing... Schlatt just went through all stages of grief.. And your're laughing?!
What’s even funnier is that Schlatt and Ph1lza have beaten multiple of the towers together
i feel like i just had a fever dream
#14:37 that think looks like a Pokémon
Schlatt's in his Philza arc
Me: Hears jojo music  Me: subscribe time
Itsfunneh played that it was easy
This channel is like bionic both of them are doing a mod series lol

Me who plays this with me friend ALL the time
rlcraft is terrifying, alternate title
16:31 -  17:23 This is the most saddest thing I have watched ever. I NEVER WANNA SEE JSCHLATT LIKE THAT AGAIN 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Tommy why don't you look up speed run videos of this or like 100 day videos of this if you look up those videos of it didn't you will probably find a way how people actually survived.
100 DAYS RL CRAFT TOMMY WE NEED ITTTTTTT
Tommy if you don't do this again, you hate me and I am a woman, meaning if you don't do it, you hate women.
24:38 *new scream unlocked*
Fuckworld will always be remembered. May he rest In peace🙏🏼🙏🏼
Rip FUCKWORLD
will u say happy birthday to me pls also congrats on #1 on trending
Jo jo music too?
damn double homicide
The Destiny 2 music from the red war when fuck world died was so nostalgic and I cried from both situations
RLCRAFT? BY TOMMYINNIT? More likely thna you think
We want dream smp vids plz
RL CRAFT MOD?
The numbers are going down from 6 to 5 to 4 to now 3 almost all of them gone mad from these mods

Tommy: oh I got some crack Me: same
Okay but is it the most hilarious?
If you’ve had a bad day just realize this isn’t important because literally 9 MILLION people subscribe Tommy. But your part of that count
NOOOOOOO JAMBO!!!!!!!
The less people he plays with, the better schlatts humor shines through tbh, I'm glad he gets some breathing room in this video, good job tommy! 👍
I like how schlat literally jumped when he got hit in the game
0:26 after that music started i got some Jojo vibes
RIP fuckworld
Did this child forget he played this before
Smp
You click baited me man you said it was you surviving it all I see is you dying repeatedly
This video was like a movie
The one vid Charlie is actually useful:
Let’s go tommy got number 1 trending!!! :)
meanwhile CrazyCraft : Am I A f*cking joke to you???
Rip Fuckworld He was the realest dog out there
Me just listening to background music jojo. Golden wind.
R.I.P Fuck World
Was that Megalovania in the background-?
Laughs in calvin destroying this modpack
Make a new SMP please I love the dream one!
Did charlie just make a reference to anime voice camp?
I loved when I heard this song from Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure at the beginning your videos are the best
“Uploads every Friday”
When Duckworld died did anyone else remember slime telling schlatt to be cautious of pressure plates.
Why does the Title say We Survived?
2nd time tommy used anime music as the background but this time its remix
His name was fuckworld and bows he’s dead I don’t have enough levels to eat this bread-Tommy 2021
Yes RL craft haaaa I survived 3 hour challenge to finish this game and I know dream can finish this game 🙂🙂🙂

What is this Mod ?
"i dont have enough skill to eat this bread" me too man, me too
You told us that there was stream after this vid. Where is the stream Thomas. Where is it?
I like how the other dog is just called the other one
Schlatt:i am having a heart attack? Me: *canon dream smp dead flashbacks* yes Schlatt yes
HEY HEY SURVIVAL WORLD? SURVIVAL WORLD? POGCHAMP?
I kinda would like to see you guys play more of this together.
Holler is the name of my

Tommy Giovanna

I love their trio, and the editing here, and also the herobrine edit. And their trio in fighting the whole tower is amazing and hillarious
Nice video but why are there so many ads
Well deserved 9mil going for that 10
Petition for this to become a series
They should do a whole series on this mod with a lot of friends and not just vidrot
the dislikes are from the people laughing so hard they missed the like button
When Tommy forgets to Friday upload:
oh wow rl craft
Pls make this a series
definitely one of my favorite videos of yours :)
Anyone know what the song used at the very beginning is called?
ONE ON TRENDING
Anyone else uncomfortable cause schlatt is in his vids now

Rest In Peace fuck world and the other one

Schlatt turning around at 6:30 I can't
jojo music makes this 100% more watchable
Now Im Scared of Schlatt
Next you know in a month tommy boy here has 11M subscribers.
Next goal: beat the ender dragon in RLcraft
Okay but destroying the spawners from a level below was actually a good strategy, the execution was just a little bit less thought out.  The video turned out amazing and made me smile after the chaotic day I've had!
Remember the good old days when Tommy and Boffy played this together
I really really enjoyed this like please do more and the music in the background made this so much better your editor is amazing oh my god this feels like when i first watched the mc manhunts please do more
Cool
good stuff
4:38 HAHAHA 🤣
this is one of myfav videos by far :))
Jojo background music
how did u make an rl craft server?
This was the most funny one yet holy shit
why did I hear Giorno's Theme except it's edited- I thought you hated anime
Def 100 day this
this got 0 to 1000000 real quick
Legend says Tommy was never caught
Kill a woman with the knife 🤣
Tommy pretending this is the first time he played rl craft  Boffy: Don’t worry I forget about my own videos
“Holes are plugged”

F for f*ckworld
Fuckworld 2 aka fuckglobe
RL craft?
RIP fuckworld...
19:28 This might’ve been coincidental, but was that a reference to Game Grumps? It sounded real close to their “Mr. Wilson” rap  “My name is Mr. Wilson and I’m here to say, I’m gonna smack your ass in a major way—“
Damn, Tommy doing RLCraft, Never thought he would do it a second time...
That was the weakest boss in this mod just wait till you meet a dragon
YES TOMMY MAKE MORE MAKE MORE HAHAHAHHAHAH NICE VIDEO
Lol i knew that your neck gonna be hurt just because you scream alot. Hope you learn your lesson, buddy.
ANYONE REMEMBER TOMMY PLAYING THIS WITH BOFFY??
6:30 I fucking lost it at this 😂😂😂
SHEEEEESH
That was funny do it again
Schlatt:Am I having a heart attack? Me:Flashbacks to Dream SMP
Ill be watching more of him if he try and complete rlcraft
Kill the dragons now :)
I'm kinda upset that he never finished his RLcraft series with Boffy
Real ones saw him play this mod way back
Parasite is the scariest mod They are weak on fire
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A RLCRAFT SERIES TOMMAY
All i got out of this video is 🖕🌎
not the first time schlatt's had a heart attack
was that a jojo reference
PART TWO!?!!?!!!?!!!?????!!
DRSTINY MUSIC
Tommy and Wilber  Name a better duo

Alternative title: two adults and a child having a panic attack for 30 minutes
30 MINUTEE VIDEOO!!!! GOSH DARNNN!!!
Slime makes videos 1000% funnier
Awww, someone unsubbed:(
When subscribed to tommy  he was at 1m subs
The intro reminds me of an old slimecicle video... I love it
I love these video’s and Wilber is so funny
*British boi plays T H E  C R A F T*  *1# on tranding*
WHY THE HELL ARE THE CURSE WORDS BLURRED OUT? THATS LIKE ONE OF THE BEST PARTS OF TOMMY AND JSCHLATT

Quick question why do u put captions on your vids
Congratulations on 9mil🔥❤️🎉
Schlatt *INTENSE PRAYING*
Congrats on 9mil!!!11
Ironic how Jschlatt made the assumption that a pressure plate was for a door in the beginning, only to loose everything to a pressure plate trap
it's always rlcraft that ehy play and of coursei t has to be the shitty modpack
YOOOOOOOOOOIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THE GIRONOS THEME
In memories of the first ever dog rapper fuckworld...   Youll always live in our hearts RIP 2021-2021
Another video POGCHAMP!
10 million sub will be a nice number.
More rlcraft with slime and schlatt would be so much fun to watch
19:15 powerful stuff brother
When Tommy uploads: automatically 1st on trending
Tommy really got 1 million views on an rlcraft video in 2021. Damn.
this is what i needed after ranboo lore thank you bestie
The throwback intro was nicee
This wasnt a 1 out of 10 video.
No one: Hey look he's playing RL craft! Everyone: Oh my god Jojo music
Is that a Jojo reference           AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
"Give that to me,I'm gonna go have some fun"-Jshlatt
this is actually 250+ mods
I hear the Destiny 2 soundtrack
You could say fuckworlds tracks were fire to the very end    Rip fuckworld
This is trend no.1
welp time to install rl craft and try to beat the ender dragon
I think I may have seen Tommy play this in the past
HOLY SMOKES TOMMY USED GIORNO'S THEME OMG
cant tell if its me but this felt like a fever dream to watch
People who want a part 2 which is like kill another mob or sum idk like comeant   ⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️
0:27 iS tHaT a jOjO rEfReNcE
The fact that schlatt happily sacrificed jambo but cried about Fuckworlds death
Charlie starts and you can hear the fear and PTSD from *experience* in the past
Did anyone realize the destiny 2 music at 17:16
Giorno theme :o
RLCRAFT isn't hard if you play it for long like 1hr in I already killed the dungeon boss and a couple dragons
29:54 when me dying to a noob several times
hes back with the part 5 music
Omg the ads are too many
RLcraft-
i lovely

Love how everytime I hear a hat in time theme. I just gonna comment about hat in time
XD i like the giorno theme
JOJO MUSIC?????
Schlatt: Am i having a heart attack? Me: Well you would know
Modpack actually, call RL Craft in its entity a single mod is ridiculously wrong
Oh
The fact that he's not wearing headphones in the thumbnail makes me very uncomfortable for some reason
The most tragic loss of 2021 was fuckworld and the other one🤧
Let's gooooo jojo in da introo
Rip fuckworld
Schlatt praying after he was struck by lightning was beautiful
i cant concentrate on mourning fuckworld when Journey from the Destiny 2 soundtrack is in the background
Tubbo should be here mabye he's doing a live stream also Tommy sounds like he has a flu or something
The loud Jojo music scared the living fuck outta me
This child is in youtube shorter than Technoblade, but here he is defeating Technoblade on the dream he have for years in yt
That moment tommy's audio levels are way higher than schlatt and slimecicles :(
Where’s Boffy?
Whoever these Slimecicle and Jshlatt guys are they sound pretty funny.
Why did I legitimately cry when the dog died!?!? That's some good editing I never cry
_"everything wants to kill you even if it's not alive"_   Boffy - 2020
congrats on 9 mil
U
Can you change your skin in a girl for 24 in real life time and show to your friends
I'd honestly enjoy a smp on rl craft
I copy
FINALLY
Is it just me or does Tommy kind of have a Karen hairstyle in the thumbnail
Please turn this into a seri s
Looks at fundys mod

“I killed a Skeleton and it became the Undead” -Tommyinnit 2021
This is the 3rd time I heard Schlatt screamed out of terror
Jschlatt once said "Im going to go have some fun with this stick".
I cant stop laughing that long sword crafting recipe is pp shaped stone
I would love to see this turned into a series
this is definitely a call back
R.I.P fuckworld, and his less successful brother.
Imagine Wilbur in here....he might make bird cult or that brain sucking monster cult.
I love how Tommy and Charlie I’ve been picked by a bird Schlatt I’M STUCK IN THE WALLLLL
He was at 7.1 million  2 months ago he grows so fast
Everyone: *PANIC* Sclat : guys I’m stuck in the wall please help me
jojo music intensifies!!!!
💞💞💞
Thankyou so much for making me happy :)
He did it with Boffy first
Calvin:I can do that Flawlessly
Slime: "I'm prettry sure god affronted by something we said"  Schhlat: *Fearly turns around*
This is what you love to see, we need rlcraft series .
Anybody else get the community rap Reference by Tommyinnit?
The Jojo theme tho
Finally you guys tried the god of all mod
Pls do more
Schlatt going “am I having a heart attack?” at 1:25 is one of the smartest jokes I’ve ever heard. One of the symptoms of a heart attack is loss of feeling in the left arm
What my mom thinks me and my friends do in our free time... 19:16
" hey there beautif- you don't have a face "
Honestly,  *worth the wait*
Re$t in peace Fuckworld

Dab me up

Cong for beating it tommy :D I beat that 4 times alr
Hello timmyinnit
I'm not even a minute into the video and I'm already having nostalgic flashbacks to rlcraft with boffy

Slimecicle sounds like he's already panicking from the start- ok maybe he is-
LETS GOOO, at least we got Charlie as a acting Phil. He's being surprisingly helpful but also hilarious AND OH GOD JSHLATT OFFERING JAMBO TO THE GODS
Charlie just got crushed by a tree
I,Tommy Giorvana,have a dream of getting 10mil
imagine they making a SMP in RLcraft XD
Damn more mid roll ads than morgz!
Tommy's intro: "Our main goal is to beat the boss."  Also Tommy, Charlie, and Schlatt: *Beatboxes and raps for a dog*
1:25 that did not age well-
Modpack tommy not mod
Oh no I’m not skilled enough so I can’t eat cake
Fun fact: Krakes, like the one at 4:23, only attack when you sprint near them. Walking is fine, but sprinting will make them want to rip your intestines out.  Edit: Apparently its Jousts that hate sprinting, not Krakes. This Krake was just playing mind games.
Whats the song at 17:30
Titian mod you can’t beat
Guys we have a problem. Jschlatt was sprinting 😟
I think tommyinnt is my favorite Youtuber
This was basically a movie
NOT SCHLATT PRAYING AHHAHA
10 mil ? Tommyinnit is gonna get 10 mil before Miniminter 100%
I like this video
hearing giornos theme from a tommy vid is amazing
Hey Mr innit do U like anime
Has anyone noticed that he started censoring the cursing then just gave up very quickly?
He legit played some Destiny music around when Fuckworld died.

RLCraft YES. My favorite modpack
Jambo cannot be sacrificed for he is an omnipotent god himself, not even the pope dares to touch him.  you're not locked in there with the pope, you're locked in there with *jambo*
That giorono's theme tho really fit the intro
You can do 10 million tommy  I belive in you😁
Tommy: *Chops down a tree* Charlie: Woah! It's coming dow- **Slimecicle was killed by physics in a block game** This truly is the hardest mod.
I remember when your were on 100k subs
You are my favorite British person
RIP Fuckworld and the other one 2021–2021
Tommy: i gonna die lot today right? Rlcraft: em.... Yes absolutamente yes.
This whole dynamic was so funny. Not a single brain cell between the three of them
R.I.P ****world, and the other one. 5:15 (Unkown) - 16:33, 16:55

Jshlatt: i fell through the floor tommy: THE ZOMBI’S GOT THE SHIELD

Me watching Flynnrights rlcraft series already knowing that they're going to fail at the tower
stop putting schlatt in ur videos
the title " i survived the hardest mod " but died like 100 times
You should do a Hide & Seek Morph Mod. Hiders and a seeker(s) while also having the ability to morph into any mod you want to avoid the seeker! Let me know if you might consider it :)
When Charlie slimecicle is the one that knows what he is doing you know you're fucked
THATS SO MANY ADDS WTF. Do u even need all that money?
The jojo moosic tho

It’s really crazy how much you’ve grown in just about 1 year, really though, good job
Aight i am thinking Tommy is watching too much JOJO but I cant blame him.  i like it tooo.
I like RLCraft tbh, but i didn't expect Tommy to play it
"Am I having a heart attack?" *DSMP flashbacks intensify
In response to description: I've been subscribed since 2mil and its been SO awesome to see you grow Tommy. You should be so proud of yourself 👏😄 Good luck with the 10 mil man!
Big House SMP man.
Day 1 of commenting dad jokes until Tommy notices me: "I don't trust stairs, they are always up to some thing"
Tommy with the consistant upload schedule. Nice
YOU GOT 9 MILLL

Tommy and his friends revenge against the tower
Hello Tommyinnit, I applied to be your editor, but I have no clue when I'll be informed on if I got the position or not.
Part 2 pls?
the boss is *_Amogus_*
This video is a masterpiece
You did this with Boffy too!!
Tommy's been using an increasing amount of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure songs in these videos
I can't believe you did this without phil
Thank you for making my day uwu
Schlatts actually really funny
I would love to see more of this!! Like as a series!
Yes the jojo bizarre music
Tommy, do you not know you are nearly at 10 million?
YESSS, THE SLIMICLE MYSICCCC

Rip fuckworld.
They left boffy out

Tommy your vidio always make me happy
Noice intro
The intro is insane

I like the Destiny 2 music playing when Fuck World died
10 seconds of online class: zzzzzzzzzzzzz 31 minutes of tommyinnit: LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

SWEET intro my man
RIP Fuckworld 😔 2021-2021 you will be missed
Oooh I remember u doing this with boffy

WHEN SCHLATT LOOKED AT THE POPE
press f for our fallen dog, fuckworld 😔
SHLATT PRAYING TO THE POP CARDBOARD FIGURE SENT ME 6:45
tommy dropped some bars ngl
i played this sooo long ago lol
*Schlatt intensely praying and making a sacrifice*
When it’s a 40 minute video: it’s Tommy I NEED TO VIEW
LOL
I can't believe that some people find him annoying
why the hell does the dungeon boss LOOKS LIKE AMONG US
bestie i really needed this after the lore that happened
R.I.P. Fuckworld the wolf
"Am I having a heart attack?"  *Flashback to the War in the drug van*
The title is wrong not a single person survived at all
There’s way too many bots here man
Peep the red war music from D2
The part when jschlatt sacifice the cat was so funny and im still laughing
More shlatt
lol
bruv i thrived in lmao
*Hears the intro music*  Is Tommyinnit now a Jojo reference!
JJBA MUSIC!
I am working on a mod pack even harder its like rl craft but  1 all armor/gear above iron tier is removed completely  2 all passive mobs are much rarer  3 not enough passive mobs spawn to hunt for much food so you have to farm and deal with farming in the seasons mod 4 all structures are much harder to find The list goes on
It’s called rlcraft which means real life craft, but it’s nothing like real life
"Defeat the dungeon boss at the top of the tower"  _Flashbacks to Phil & Schlatt's Hexxit series_
I protest for a part 2
Next goal, kill a level 3-5 dragon :)
Petition to make Schlatt's youtube pfp Drip dog
U guy's actually played RLCraft
I thought tommyinnit gonna upload a video this Friday then when I open my phone I didn't see it then i cry the the whole day...
schlatt and philzas hexxit series was amazing very happy they are playing this, slimes to rlcraft video is also amazing
4:30 is that a fuckin demigorgon!?!!!!!????
Georgenotfound brother killed you message not found
congrats
Tommy is the cure to deppression
the part 2
8:13 schlatt i cant defend you anymore-
If you can't do a simple task as eating a carrot... that mod is too difficult for me!
Hearing Tommy say "Mans got a shank" both makes me laugh yet morbidly terrifies me
Tommy: I dont do it for the money His videos: *100 ads intenstifys*
This is the funniest video I've ever watched
Charlie will never cease to amaze me 🤣
Who's holler...
Charlie: God was affronted by something we said Schlatt: *stares at Pope Francis*
RIP Fuckworld
why is tommy kinda good at rapping tho
“New posts every Friday” tommy you lied to me >:(( (LMAO)
Yes yes yes! Love this! Please make it a series 🤞🏼🤞🏼
Schlatt just wasn't made for this much intense shit happening all at once
Wait so this wasn't the funniest mod ever?
Please make this a series, it would be so awesome to watch!
WHY IS HE PUTTING JOJO REFERENCES?!?!?!
part 2
Congrats on 9 million Tommy!
i saw this 3 hours ago and thought it was old ;-;
Jambo be like 😑
Charlie and Schlatt: **Trust the child with a weapon**  Tommy: *Instantly stabs Charlie*
Veterans: bro just use fishing rod
Why did no one get the reference from Charlie about anime voice camp 8:58
an RL Craft series would be so cool!!!!
o7
Love the JOJO MUSIC!!!
LOOOL THE WAY JSCHLATT LOOK AT THE POPE PLEASE
Jojo uwu
I still love that it’s called RLcraft, even though the only realistic thing are trees falling and thirst.
You should use this mod for a smp.
They were playing the most ridiculous fucking RPG to ever exist
Play more if this pls
The like ratio tho
I hear destiny music :)
o7 f^ckworld you will be missed
PLEASE MAKE THIS A SERIES
This 30 min video is like an action movie
13:51 unprepared german soldiers at normandy during dday be like
Moment of silence for fuckworld, A true hero
by the end of this month he’s gonna have like 10 videos with jjba music
nice destiny 2 music
Tommy using a Jojo theme bgm I was like: "IM JAMMING BOIS"
It's funny that the first time I had ever heard of Tommy was an RLCraft video. I was obsessed with the mod and the only YouTuber who played it regularly was Boffy.
Yes
Love the JoJo intro
Mans said the whole Our father in front of Pope francis.
U should try 100 days at rl craft
Instead of fuck work 2 I would name him fuck earth
i will never unsub to you Tommy
ALR BUT WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT JOJO BEING IN THE INTRO SHSJHSHAHAJ IM PROUD
They do be spitting bars tho
Is ThAt A jOjO rEfErEnCe!?
THE JOJO MUSIC
And again i ask why youtubers cant just give us the link to the mod.
why does jschlatt sometimes sound like greg and jermaine
The fuck is the destiny 2 music on
WHERE IS PHILZA?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
I remember when tommy played rl craft with boffy and it was hilarious.
HI TOMMY
9 MIL POG
Rip fuck world
Whats the song called that he plays in the beginning
Play roblox jojo game
Just...... what even happened
bro tommy, you're growing up so fast, im proud of you
I never knew these 3 were a combo I needed until now
NEARLY THERE TOMMY 10 MIL IS COMING
I am 3 hours ago I’m not that late 😅
Did I just hear Giorno’s theme at intro that means...     *JOJO REFERENCE *
R.I.P fuckworld they will be remember as the best rapper
comparing schlatt to the first herobrine sighting is the best comparison ever to be made.
Funny how instead I thought this video was 1000% funny
Number 2 on trending btw
Ah yes, the jojo reference
I was drinking water when schlatt said why are church bells ringing and water came spewing out of my nose and I died
NO BECAUSE I SWEAR THE INTRO IS EDITED EXACTLY LIKE HIS OLD RLCRAFT VID WITH BOFFY. SOBS SO LOUD AND HARD
Behold!... THE WORLD!!!
Tommy is now the slicer
THE NINE MILLION SPECIAL VIDEO  THE THING THAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR LETS GOOOO
Ah yes,I love the old video edit
schlatt: “i have to offer a sacrifice” jambo: wtf...
I was hoping to see Boffy, if I am to be honest.
Came home from a good day at work and see this, good day today
Rip Fuckworld 2021 to 2021
Tommy: hEy ThErE bEAuTiFuL— you don't have a face ☹️  Me: *Wtf???* 😂
'survived' isn't really a way to put it
2nd in tending!
3:44 WHAT DID SCHLATT SAY I-
What’s the opening song it sounds fire
Why does it look like Slimecicle has no shirt...
Jojo bizarre music in the intro?
R.I.P FUCKWORLD
are you gonna play RLcraft with boffy again sometime?
I was watching Charlie's rlcraft videos earlier and then saw this in my subscriptions, nice.
I don't know what is happening but I like it
the destiny music in the background XD
i remember watching him play with boffy
remember when he played this with boffy
the funniest video ever
Tommy started doing the fucking Dean payday rap from community 😭😭😭
I always love tommyinnt videos
This reminds me of popularmmos is epic proportions series. Well it probably does cause it's full of mods.
Schlatt: dies Slimecicle: "I'm pretty sure god was affronted by something we said." Schlatt: confused looking at the pope  That got me cracked up
Bruh the Destiny 2 music at 17:20
LIKE THE VIDEO
Is anyone gonna talk about jschaltts creepy picture and him sacrificing to cardboard-
Ayyy let's go. Only 3 hours late
I instantly saw jschlatt and knew this was gonna be godly
he's becoming more and more like charlie every day... first the giornos theme as a mc video opening, next the rl craft video..... hell yeah
I’m not sure that YouTube is the one that’s unsubscribing people
good vidoe
Jschlatt: time to sacrifice my cat
oh yeah and rip fuckworld
Came for the giorno theme
I have a little feeling that Tommy likes Jojo
Modpack*
Gone, but never forgotten         R.I.P FuckWorld
Giorno theme used
Them fighting in the tower just reminds me of the hexxit hardcore series Phil did with Schlatt
I literally thought Slimesicle was shirtless.
Does Tommy like golden wind cause he Been using it in the last  and this video ?
Yo TOMMY what mod is that??? I wanna try it
omg please make a rlcraft series itd be so much fun
The unbecoming comfort reciprocally guard because weapon byerly fasten of a magenta verse. zealous,  fresh slash

Noice
I would play this pack but my pc sucks
The way schlatt turned to his pope cutout was fucking amazing

Why do i hear giorno's theme remix? r u a jojo fan editor larry?
JOJO DODODODKDODODPDOD GOLDEN WIND DODODODODODPDOD
i think he should continue this as a series
Hey guys does anyone know the song opening for Tommy’s videos
That intro feels heavily influenced by slimecicle and honestly...     im not complaining =)
RLcraft!
Tommy has a way of making the worst days Better, what is this witch craft
PLEASE MAKE A SERIES OF THIS PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
Schlatt: gets struck by lightning. Also Schlatt: *LITERALLY STARTS TO FUCKING PRAY*
When you realize he’s played RLCraft before, with Boffy-
"That's an s tier weapon in the uk"
Schlatt is so proud that he fell through the floor
Imagine if boffy was in this video (ogs remember )
Oh ok 👌
i've only now come to realize the effects charlie's rlcraft video must have had on his mental health
Tommy is really good at rapping
please the ads are killing me
You make my day 100% times better tommy!
MAKE THIS A SERIES
HAHAHAHAAHHA
Fun fact: this video is longer than a manhunt video
Thomas Innit
RIP Fuckworld
fuckworld: dies *TOP 10 SADDEST ANIME DEATHS
gte tommy to 10 mil so he can finally talk to that girl at college
Soup
You killd that disable kids wheel chair
He said you can always unsubscribe in the start not you can always subscribe
tommy is pretinding not to know RLcraft he littirally did it with Boffy sorry for bad english:]
Why so many ads your videos are starting to have more ads than a morgz vid
yoooooooooooooo TOMMY LEZ GOOO NUMBER 2 ON TRENDING
One day late timeout for tommy.. don’t make me pull out the flip flop
Tommy is getting a lot of subs next week he will have 10mil
Hey Tommy u should use the fishing rod bug to the guardian multiple times then hit him with a sword, that will fling him
17:54
These videos with swearing bleeped out just aren't the same
I love the way he cuddled soup! That was so wholesome! Also schlatt turned into Lana del Ray when he was singing.
17:53
have you ever watched jojo tho
Can u put the mods in the description pls
what happened to boffy and you
I really want this as a series
I killed my dog i need food
Part 2?
yeeeeeeeaaaaaaa giornos theme i watch jojo right now cause im bored u know
Another RLcraft vid. Il sub.
Jschlatt sacrificing jambo to the priest is hilarious  (Sorry if i dont know what is the name of the priest dont hate me)
I find him annoying for uploading a day after
16:25 sent me
Aah human suffering never gets dull
Shivaxi is smiling
"his name was fuckworld now he is dead" "I don't have enough skill to eat this bread"
WAIT HE USED THE SONG FROM THE FIRST MISSION OF DESTINY 2’s ORIGINAL CAMPAIGN
I mean JoJo music again he truly is the best
Hey um there is a video in all of your ads
Hate to say it tommy but I don’t find your videos very funny anymore. Try changing up the structure so it has more variety than rotating between 3 different POVs and constant dying.
mrbeast stole tommy's 1# on gaming spot.
pls Play Magicraft:land of extintion
love all your vids tommy also i like the jojos intro
TOMMYINIT NEVER GETS OLD-
30 minutes of pure chaos and not preparing stuff and defeat the dungeon boss?? Sounds about right
Me through out this video: IS THAT THE GRIM REAPER
YUEUSEERRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jojo be like
I like the jojo music at the start yk
I never finished rl craft its too hard villages have no beds and the spawn point is random
Love these videos
* Crying Sneegsnag sounds *
WHEN JSCHLATT STARTS SPEAKING IN TONGUES LMAOO
Not bad rap tho am I right ?!!
omg i never laughed so hard in the bathroom
The JoJo music in the beginning is just mwa
If TommyInnit says that is fun to do the 100 days video on RLcraft,does it mean that he knew and already watched Forge Labs?
if u watch slimcicles rlcraft video and tommys at the same time, the intro music syncs up
Fun Fact: Technoblade streamed playing this with Schlatt a while back.
I need mote
18:11 soup 🥺🥺🥺
Jschlatt when he loses the manberg vs pogtopia war: 1:25
I remember the giant tower from PopularMMOs, thank you
WE NEED MORE!!!
Can't believe that tommy is the one providing schlatt content
The destiny 2 music was a great choice
Wow second on trending
me: drinking water while watching. jslaht: gets killed by lux jangu :me spits out water. jslaht: f u lux jangu. me: spits out even more water
anyone remember when he did this with boffy
Since when did tommy sensor his videos
CONGRATULATIONS ON 9M SUBS!!
His name is fuckworld and now he's dead (o7) I don't have enough skill the eat this bread (Fuck)
Copyright music
This is some Tommyinnit post-revival sounding shit
Do more rl craft with big j and bif s
Did they have forge labs set this up?
Title: i survived    Also tommy: dies like 20 times
Schlatt offering up Jambo to the Pope is fucking hysterical
They’re exploring while Charlie’s remembering
Never let tommy lose don't let tommy get hilarious don't let the subscribers down
ur reaching flamingos subscribers go for it tommy lets goo you can do it POGG!!!
5:25 was a sus moment😳
That was 30 minutes????
"God was affronted by what we said" *Jschlatt instantly looks to the pope*
I survived these shitty videos
It’s nice to hear Cuphead music once in awhile
THE JOJO MUSIC ITS OFFICAL TOMMY IS A JJBA WEEB
0:08 Not tommy playing jojo theme
only gs remember this from 3 hours ago
When he uploads on Saturday instead of Friday...
When you wanna watch a Tommyinnit video but Jschlatt makes you uncomfortable as shit :(
Giorno’s theme at the start sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
I havea darn feeling that tommy is gonna get cancelled for making a video with schlatt.
Tommy your 2# on trending
Soup
anyone knows whats the boss music that Tommy uses in the background when fighting the boss
#2 on trending nice
Thomas Innit do something different
Any KrewCraft watchers here with me? #ItsFunneh
I love how every thumbnail Tommy is different. He doesn't use the same "laughing tommy" for his thumbnails. He's a legend. ( ╹▽╹ )
Slimecicle should’ve also said to avoid that real weird water
17:07 I can't be the only one that recognized Journey from Destiny 2
Is Charlie rubbing off on Tommy? He uses the diornos theme that is in most of slime’s vids, and I felt a similar energy in the intro 👀
Fuckworld.
Very cool series I love Tommy modded
i love the new editing style
*waiting for teachno and tommy collab*
I like how the editor blurred the swear words at the start but then just stopped trying
The stongest boss in rl craft is the tier 5 dragon and the tier 5 serpent
we need tecno.
6:31 i fuckin lost it here 😂
Charlie is having flashbacks
Yo, Tommy, you whatch JoJo Bizarre Adenture
YADSSSS
Didn't he already try rlcraft before? I think it was with Boffy
This is not how you play RLcraft
Do it again
soup is the chosen one
0:06 *me watching entire golden wind in a few days flashback*
Oh,a tommyinnit video which is not 100% funnier??!?  This is a miracle
Yes he answer my suggestion
yooooooooooooo tommy has some fucking bars man
17:15 Destiny 2 music pog
hi tommy
16:30 *Where men cried*
rip fuckworld :(
Lol
*RIP Fuckworld* rip the other one
idk why you seemed so surprised. you played this modpack with boffy.
Sry if you do acknowledge this I have not seen the whole video yet but you can spam the bosses with a fishing rod from a nerd pole next to the tower run in grab the loot and leave from the other side for some reason the boss won’t move until you get close enough and each time you pull on it it will stack up the force and send the boss flying thousands of blocks away
“It’s lasering you”
R.i.p. Fuckworld 2021-2021  Oh and the other one too I guess lol
6:37 schlatt prayed to the pope hhhahaha
7:49 i've never heard a more sincere scream from schlatt
What’s with the jojo music🤣
My biggest flex it that I act like tommy
Pov your dream:
no description thingy?
“It’s a bipedal lobster” yes that is a bipedal lobber
Anybody gonna talk about giorno’s theme
Congrats on 9 mill my man
Rip fuckworld
why on earth did i just hear lego batman the videogame theme music NOW DESTINY TWO MUSIC WHAT THE FUCK
Part 2 when?
Cmon made it Trending #1!!!!!!
jo jo golden wild jo jo golden wild
Tommy do this build up beside the tower like 4 blocks with fishing rod and spam it on the boss then Walk up to the boss
I love 100 days
POOR SCHLATT  22:58
who remembers his last vid when he played this
Amazing
Gay
Golden wind
Ngl that rap Tommy did at 19:24 was actually fire
Ey man the intro was a jojo reference cuz of the music
bruh I was waiting for tommy to play this mod :))))
yes
LMAOOO SHLATT SACRIFICING THE CAT
moment of respect for editor larry:
Thats RL Craft
Dude that rap with tommy he do be poppin off!!
#2 ON TRENDING LET'S GOOOO
Pls pretty pls do a pt 2
False its not the hardest!!
I love the background music 👀
3:04 Is that the Lego Batman soundtrack?
I can't even watch fucking FuckWorld die without getting ads
Love that giorno's theme in the background when the video starts.
Not even a dragon smh
"His name is fuckworld and he is dead, i don't have enough skill to eat this bread" Truly inspirational
Hardest mod? *what about titan's mod* or is the title about hardest actually playable mods?
Charlie is experiencing this hell again? Oh no
Tommy: hey there bueatifu-  it doesn’t have a face
"His name was f*ckworld, now he is dead" "I don't have enough skill to eat this bread"  Probably the best Tommyinnit lines out of context
A 30 minute mod video? I'm literally in heaven.
Tommy: can your dog rap? Schlatt: it doesn't speak English Charlie: *but it can completely destroy you in Spanish*
At 3:00 minutes in the video Tommy got closer to Philza, mentally and spiritually.
Who remembers the RLCraft video from a year ago with BoffyYT
It was so funny
Ayop
I couldn't even breathe during this entire video
Do more
Im surprised schlatt didn’t recognize ben shapiro
It’s Saturday
I love playing RLcraft
i love you
Who knew slimecicle could rap
Tommy great job I been a fan :>
congratulations on 9 million!
Wait, what is this mod anyway? I want it
NOOOOO FUCK WORLD 😫
TOMMY DO IT DO A SERIES OF DIS NOT THEM ONLY U PLSSSS
Rip fuckworld
4:29 “this is my posture”
Schlatt sacrificing Jambo is soo funny
Rip fuckworld
I watched your stream yestetday but i didnt really stay since i was playing with a friend hahah
This is how many people like tommy 👇
Yes please do more this is awsome you should do 100 day vid or a series
30 mins of my life just got better
omg DRAGONS. I GUESS I GOTTA SPEEDRUN DRAWING TOMMY WITH DRAGONS NOW edit: genuinely thought it was a dragons mod for a solid minute
I love tommy (sh*t im gay)
Schlatt: (growls) me: now copy that at put it over the dogs barks if it ever barks, please. XD
Charlie's trauma is showing lol.
They should make this a series
i love the old intros that was my favorite part of the vid
When I heard schlatt I immediately left a dislike that mans racist
i was laughing so hard my brother had to come and ask what was so funny, we watched together 😎👍🏻
I never thought that Tommy would try out mods that I never imagined him to play.
I think the editor like destiny 2...
But u played it with boffy? Or no🙁
holy Tommy chasin the bag
Tommy is slowly turning into Slimecicle and I love it
Tommy's Thumbnail: Tommy in red tommy shirt  Tommy in video: *it was all a LIE*
more   now
A DIFFERENT GOAL? WHAT??
Omg l am better than him at beats may l prase f*ckworld
OGS will remember this is not Tommy's first time playing RLcraft 👀
22:40 is a rare or removed vanilla death message
i actually want to see more of rlcraft  please do
This give me memories of schlatt and Phil playing hex
This probably ain't the hardest mod, hope there's something harder out there.
Damn slime can rap
schlatt: am i having a heart attack?  me: i wonder if that was on purpose.
#2 in gaming prettyyyyyyy cool
0:27 Giorno's theme?-
Tommyinnit finally put jojo giorno theme music
DAMN BOI THERE IS SOME JOJO THEME LETS GO!
I like the Destiny sad music
what is that inro song called again?
This was a really funny video hope they do a part 2 or maybe even more.
Sure I'll subscribe                        🙂🤝🙂
Tommy is giorno
"Hey there beautiful-  You don't have a face"  -Tommyinnit
Poor slimecicle in the intro lol
Slime has played RLCraft before, which makes this so much funnier
R.i.p f*ckworld
Congrats on 9 million
You could have just had a fishing rod throw it at the beast releases it and then activate the boers in their notice go flying
Rip fuckworld man
4:36 "oh i got some crack"
Do a 100 day in hardest mod
I love how you played Giorno's Theme in the Title of the video
why is life?
Schlatt hittin the little our father lmaooooo
just broke my ankle now im laying on the ground watching your video
the tower dungeon boss is ez you can just use a fishing rod and it would get flinged and die
Want to see your part 2
can you PLEASE do swappers vs trappers against tubbo again, thats has always been one of my fav of ur vidoeos
You don’t have a high enough level to breath
This is so weird because me and my brother literally also started this kinda modded survival world and we also went to tackle this tall tower and we had the exact same problems as them lol
What about defeating a level 5 dragon
tommy you should invite dream team dont give up everyone tommy is so close to 10 millionn
18:32 what part of hamilton is this
Giorno's theme....
This reminds me of that one series Phil and Schlatt did together way back
I have been waiting for him to make an RLcraft vid forever…
Shit just went from charlie to philza real fuckin quick
Top 10 Saddest Anime Deaths
Dude! I wanna see more of this, it was awesome
Tommy: starts video with Giorno’s theme Charlie: “He’s starting to believe”
Rip fuckworld
This has been the best yet.
Slimecicle is already greatly increasing the quality of this video by 1. Knowing how this mod works to save viewer frustration 2. Being the paranoid PTSD character
why did you use destiny music lmao
oh you're approaching me instead of running away you're coming right to me
Yeees
Make a series with all your friends
TOMMYS RAP LOWKEY WENT HARD ASF 😳😳‼️‼️
Is it just me or i found herobrine spawn in the fog
I am happy
Pls play more RL craft and I just say this RL mean Real Life and pls play more
Tommy is gaining subscribers fast Keep up the great work kid
9:10
Holy that's too hard for me noob
Make more videos about this server you couldn't make this a popular server
#2 ON TRENDING FOR GAMING POGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Let's go!!!
Giorno’s theme really?
HelOoO bI-
The best part is that this is one of the weakest bosses in the game lmao
Charlie definitely has gotten PTSD from rlcraft and tommy’s challenges in general.
Reading the comments is content on its own tbh
This better be a re-occurring series
Sorry tommy I couldn't watch your stream  I only watched small of it
CAP
Bro the dream smp boys are literally feeding us right now
Tommathy insidofit what are you doing?!
its always a good day when tommy uploads a 30 minute video
When fuckworld died it reminded me of gonzo-
Where does he get his mods
18:31
e
Early i guess subbed with notifications on
JOJO (everytime I hear the opening i will comment this. :p)
i want a part 2
I bet you Tommy's gonna become the next Tom Gravy.
We need to thank tommy forbuploading very frequently
“I got some crack” damn I’m guessing this is the 10 million reveal
Ehh?!?! Is God there cuz it is Sunday in my country
Remembering that time Tommy played RLCraft with Boffy taht everyone forgot about  Vid is still on Boffy’s channel for anyone who hasn’t seen it, it’s really funny and I totally recommend you watch it
.
This should be a series, this trio is very entertaining and the video was really good!
Congrats on 9M TommyInnit!
This was %1000 funnier
flashbacks to when tommy played rlcraft with boffy when he was still a nobody
Please do a 100 days Tommy
Tommy uses a jojo song
Dam LOOK AT ALL THOSE ADDS 😭 MANS MAKING HELLA MONEY
do agen
Hi tommy i just broke my leg and its my birthday and it will make my day if u say happy birthday
when he thinks the dungeon boss is the hardest
I’m tired of people calling RL craft a mod, it’s a mod*pack* goadamnit. It’s not just one mod. Please- it bugs me to bo end-
Why is there destiny music when the dogs died
This honestly was so much fun!! You should really make more of these it was dead funny!!
Me dancing to the intro for a solid 5 minutes: "oh yeah, this is a banger video"
rating 8/10 pros: colorful, looks really interesting, PETS, cool scenes, schlatt. just- schlatt. cons: there are some quiet parts,  needs structure- (meaning a plan, most preferably tommy being the leader) again sometimes can be too quiet lol, not enough tambo note:  f*ckworld was a good dog :(
RLCraft is for REAL gamers
Using journey for fuckworld's death made it so much mor sad
Rip fuckworld, you will be missed
but how much funnier was it??? was it not funny!?!?
good job tommy :D
jcatt was so chill when he was being sacrificed
Dang tommy grew so fast my crying WHERE MY ANGEL OLD TOMMY
The haters be like fuck world you
That Giorno theme at the start lmao
why i remember karmaland with this?
30:26 When you defeat the Golem, and then remember there’s still the Ice and Fire mobs
Make a series out of this
THE PILLAR MEN!!!!!
Reminds me of when he played RLcraft with Boffy lmao
no joke yt actually unsubbed me
Don’t think he survived....
Also why is slimcical in lore just him in real life

“Do you really want To respawn? Think about it.. “
You...       ARE LATE!         Eh it’s OK
Finally.
Am I the only one who feels like they've watched this before?- Like, a month ago or something
So cool 😎
Jschlatt: am i having a heart attack?    Me: AGAIN?
Watching ur vids drunk is pretty hard( just found out)
Tommy needs to make his own songs😯👏
didnt boffy play with tommy before?
great video
to be continued???
HOLY SHIT THIS WOULD BE SO GOOD ANIMATED THO
This makes my day even more better👌👌
30 minutes of tommy surviving RLcraft, I'll take it.
This is lit
Tommy already made a video on this mod
moree pls
I was legit laughing for 5 minutes midway through the video(I had to pause it), around when Fuckworld died and the grave... I died
Is schlatt going to have another heart attack we will never know
*NOOOOOOOO* FUCKWORLD!!!!
The jojo song thingie made me happy ngl i forgot what to call it 👍🥲
Would not say they survived like at all
anyone else remember when he did this with Boffy?
nice vid tommy, watching from the Philippines :>
I thought it is commonly known that you can kill it with a wooden fishing rod
Congrats on 9.M Tommyinnit we will always support you
charlie is getting ptsd
accidentally earlyish
Does anybody notice the destiny 2 music
Tommy in it is now a jojo reference
now i know why he got rid if the "1000% funnier" title for this video
Schlatt's genuine fear throughout this video is so funny
This is hilarius
please make this a series
this video made me cry of laughter, so good.
Can you say hi? Please? 😁
guys did you know fuckworld dropped a new album? its fire. he didn't actually die
I HEAR JOJO IN THE BEGINNING
Congrats on 9mill
The most powerful beaing in this mod is lvl 5 dragon then why your hacking boss is a freaking tall man with one eye bruh
Uh- *this ain't possible*
fuck world o7
Dude you will get to 10 Mil subs before techno which was literally 10 year old account i think
RIP fuckworld and the other one ✊😔
Charlie dropped the rock but the roc wont drop him
I love the Lego Batman music now and again in the background😂
RLCraft. The best.
Tommy’s videos let me down somwtimes
why do i laught at every second thing ? haha i love these video's
31 minutes of funniness
you should make this a series
pog
Please do this with jschlatt more
𝑩𝒐𝒐𝒑 𝒃𝒐𝒑 𝑩𝒊𝒕𝒄𝒉
Ngl my fav Treo at the moment 😂💕
That mod ain't that hard, for me, it's kinda fun to play it, all the things I do is to train my own dragon, and KILL the stage 5 fire dragon
We need more SMP content plz
LESGOOOOO
17:10 Is that journey from Destiny 2?
that battletower golem looks pretty sus
4:21 its a demorgon
Schlatt: ‘My Left Arms Hurt, Am I Having A Heart Attack?’ Me: F_ck.. He’s Going To Die With The Same Death Again 👀
elodie did well with this, you can see why she needed the extra day :D
Finally
Where is the link so i can play?!?!
who else wanted quackity merch but didn’t get it ✋🥲
The “I hope you enjoy because we didn’t!” Was amazing, I haven’t even started the video but I’m so hyped
This would be a cool series to start
Charlie rapping on the big pole was one of the saddest thing I’ve watched
This guy is a fool
the intro music is Giorno's Theme (Jay D remix)
Is no one else gonna talk about how they were dropping some good bars.  :v
I lost it when jschlatt sacrificed his cat 😂.
It’s another JoJo reference
Rip fuckworld and that other guy
😌100 DAYS WITH TUBBO
when he said the name hexxit that gave me so many happy memories
Legend has it he died
i played RL craft before with my friend and immediately just quit
now make a series of 3 years in rlcraft
They didint get Philza beacause he would complete the game to fast
I like how he referenced the heart attack
18:24 probably the editor suffered while doing this captions
I think this is my favorite video ever 😂
10:59 Please- 😂
This mod is so difficult that by the time I got to the end I could one shot the ender dragon and still could not defeat the dungeon guardian without cheesing it
Make this a series
The dragon is the scary thing
Next week, do you think you could play the Aether legacy mod? It has its own dungeons, so that could be a goal to work towards instead of beating the ender dragon.
Why is jojo's theme song playing in the start? Im soo confused
I was subscribed since 100k now he’s at 9mil
Im always late 😭 even tho im late 2 hours. I still wanna watch it though.
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeh
“Hey there beautif- it doesn’t have a face”
I remember when Tommy played this with Boffy a while ago.
This is one of my favorite mods, tbh
great vid!
The well-made whale pharmacologically long because waiter utrastructurally excuse beyond a secret act. nondescript, bite-sized castanet
Part 2
This is so much fun to watch because there so much new things.
That jojo music hit hard
Everybody gangster until tommyinnit plays a song from my favorite game (Destiny 2)
Noice

I AM GONNA SUBSCRIBE TO YOU WITH MY 11 ALT ACCOUNTS!!!! IF IT'S TO SEE YOU PLAY THIS CRAP UTIL IT BECOME A SERIES, IT'S WORTH IT!!!!!!!!

Who remembers when he did this with boffy?
Yeeeeee! Rlcraft rules!

i laughed my ass off
for anyone who's confused why he censors the swear words in the beginning its because you will get demonetized if there is any swears in the first 3 minutes
Hello.
Now this is entertaining
Gives memories back to Hexxit Homies
Why is goldenwind playing in the background?
TommyInnit's videos never let me down
RLcraft is terrifying yet ridiculous xD
Read The bible guys. Or this can happen to you- 6:17

Jojo music pog
The jojo intro was awesome
Tommy just uploaded feeling good
7:35 genuine screams
Yeaaaaaa
Dang bro
What is with the jo jo song intros
Everyone gangsta until they realize that they can just use a few stack of blocks and a rod.
Hardest mod pack, not mod, smh
Tommy you should try out the Twilight Forest mod
tommy keeps putting giornos theme in his videos and every time i start to think he's less annoying
YAS I MISSED THIS INTRO MUSIC TOMMY
Ianbealio would be proud

I could tell this was hard.
Fuck world
The destiny music hits different
10:52 Schlatt has confirmed that Tommyinnit is actually funny
4:38 nice hahaha
Petition for Tommy to play RL craft as a series with tubbo...
HE ADDED JOJO MUSIC LETS GOOO
So no one is going to talk about the ghoul , let’s just say I shit my 👖 🙃
fundy’s crying rn
I remember when he did this with boffy
You can get a monster stuff in spawn in the crustacean looking thing in the bird that picks you up and you can ride the bird you would just have to learn a new creature somehow and you would have to get the monster stuff
LOL they think rlcraft is hard
Im halfway through. If Fuckworld dies i’m gonna shit my pants  Edit: Oh my god kill me.
We loved Fuckworld...
RL CRAFT
Schlatt: My left arm is damaged am I having a heart attack?  Me: Excuse me
First death by Tommy at 3:01 closely followed by Jschlat at 3:03
I just got braces and now my mouth is level 2 with a EXP Booster. I can now eat bread.
I like how the dungeon tower boss is litterally a 5min easy speedrun fo rrlcraft players like why is that your goal
30:40 w XD
This is a very slimecicle style of editing
Listen carefully to the music; it’s destiny 2 music
Lol giornos theme
I love how he keeps putting Giorno’s Theme
rip fuckworld
Return of the king... I mean 2019 editing style
8:59 DONT THINK YOU CAN JUST SLIP AN ANIME VOICE CAMP REFERENCE PAST ME MR SLIMECICLE
this reminds me of all of the mods popularmmos did like the twilight forest, the one where they had the tall towers (epic proportions?) for many seasons and the crafting dead, all in one
*laughing in german* HEROOOO
Guess who's back
Slime sounds constantly horrified
If tommy did a 10p days with slimeicle and sclatt it would be weird and very very funny
My birth day :)
do this but without jschlatt ❤️
Its almost RL craft
9.09M Subs POG
Finally more RLcraft
30:01 yyyyyayyyyyyyyyy

Tommy and Charlie - Gods at rapping  Jschlatt - Last time I've seen this man with Philza on Hexxit (It was pogchamp) (great vid btw, I loved it)
JOJO!!
Tommy I think your intro Is a jo-jo reference
Tommy: proceed to die  Also tommy: I survived the hardest mod
29:51 XD
y'all know schlatt already played this with techno
COME ON KILL THAT LVL 5 DRAGON
0:31 is beautiful
Didn't he played that with boffy
FINALLY THIS VIDEO WAS 1 DAY LATE
Charlie really brings these videos to life. He's so funny.
Jojo theme
at 17:00 I was laughing too hard today my chest has been hurting and if I move or laugh it really hurts but I just couldn't hold it in
Hey tommy i dunno why but i think you should play this with boffy, totally not begging for a sequel or anything
rlcraft e z
Jschlatt; am i having a heart attack Me: not again...
# RIP fuck world
Soup being in this video is everything
I question why I don’t watch your streams and only your videos, is it because my mental health has been shit, or is it because I’m stubborn and don’t want to watch your streams
Almost 10 mil yey!
29:24 uh oh
..
Try’s to dislike the video “You don’t meet the requirements to do this”
Tommy I am drunk but still watching and subscribing
How dare you upload DURING EUROVISION
Charlie has ptsd
the pressure plate was the biggest foreshadowing ive ever seen
❤️‍🔥
I enjoyed it! i've been starting playing RLCraft on my own so i've gotten acceptable at it. I could provide some info about how to survive if ya want.
If you didnt knew the difrence it isnt a mod its a modpack
Jschlatt: "Am i having a heart attack? "  Me: *"Welp that didn't age well--"*
RIP in the chat for fuck world 😔
29:20 pogchampppppppppppppppp!1!1!!1!!1!
0:11 is that among us. 😳
Fuckworld died trying to save schlatt
Me after reading the Title + seeing the Thumbnail: *Hmm yes, RL Craft, my beloved....* Me starting the video: *Yessss, torture these poor Minecrafters until they Rage-quit, they have no idea what they have done* Me after they kill Shlatt's dogs: *Silence Also me: *So, it's Treason then....*
“Wow it’s coming down!” *fucking dies* 😂
One word can describe this video “Bruh.....”
Slimecicle: HOW IS THE DOG SKILLED ENOUGH TO WEAR CLOTHES BUT IM NOT  i cant with this man 💀
Should've got Sneegsnag
Please, somebody tell me that song in the beginning. I need to listen to it in repeat
Dude imagine dream and technoblade doing this! 😂😂

Tommy uploading is cool and all but like did you guys see Eurovision
It is funny how at 6:31 Schatt looked behind him and prayed and then sacrificed soup the cat (I call the cat soup)

Finally, the curse of the “Funniest Video Ever” titles has lifted
Looks like a slimesicle intro

You can tell charlie is having intense flash backs
Guinness world records 2021: ‘girl laughs for 30:59 minutes straight-‘

As a RLcraft veteran. I can definitely say this.      *They are f@&king idiots*
RIP Fuckworld 2021 - 2021
“I’m not high on drugs I swear.” Me: “aren’t  you though?”

Pleeeease do more RLCraft this was hilarious 🤣
The start of fuckworld smp
Beat simon!!!!!!!!
6:21 mans just tried to pronounce the ceo of YouTube's last name
One word on how to defeat the dungeon boss: Jump up and place blocks precisely 7 block away I’m the dungeon/tower, then proceed to place blocks and jump 72 times. After this process, take out a fishing rod an throw the line at the dungeon boss. Try not to attract any mobs while doing so. After doing this, jump and after 0.58 milliseconds, pull in the line. This will send the boss flying, and it will die to fall damage. Thank you for listing!
Rip FuckWorld  2021-2021
This remix of ill Vento d'oro in the intro is a banger
will this be a series on rl craft or no?
Resident Evil 8 looks different here
wait this counts as survival?
The zombies walk so swag with their drip 😎
It’s weird to think I’ve been here since 100K and Big man’s done hit 9 mil 🥺🥺🥺
XD
THIS MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD I NEARLY WOKE EVERYONE UP- -Its a reaper, sometimes when you go to sleep a reaper might spawn. -The "Eagle screech" is a griffin 👁➖👁 -No problem for useless ass tips Tommy 😀👍 -Ifyou press H I believe You can heal yourself if you have bandages, -Skelletons can one shoot you If they hit you in the head with a arrow -Level 5 Dragons are the strongest, dragons in the game and also can Drop dragon eggs/egg If you defeat it, -Reapers also can go through blocks 😬 -The battle towers , are probably the second? most OP Structures in the game since you can get up to glowing ingots, glowing ingots can be used for a dragon eye, a dragon eye is used to protect you from the dragon's (It most of the time doesnt work 🥲✋) -More tips are on youtube,     Thanks for reading, just wasted your time with my horroble explanation and uneducated self, since I haven't played RLcraft in 2 years 😀👍
Fuckworld is the G.O.A.T.
these vidieos make me laugh so much i cant breath
Not jambo
the fucking mcyts are gonna find jjba now, thanks tom
2:50 monke
not the wolfs😭
I’m not early but I love this
Shiiii
Do it again
20:12 footbollinnit
So we're just gonna ignore the fact tommy played this once before with boffy?
You should do some type of mini game like lucky-block bedwars.It might do very well. Especially since the crew be funny.
Nobody: The dragon: vRoOm vrOOm
I like how Charlie is teaching them while meanwhile having PTSD from his video about Rlcraft
Tommy + Jotaro = Jotom
I love how Tommys rap was just Dean Peltons (from community) peanutman rap
if your gonna do another video on the mod then dont forget to craft a summoning staff and also you can tame the roc with avian treats and then use a soulstone on the roc  Fun fact: any flying monsters you encounter (except for dragons) can be tamed and every time you tame them you need to use a soulstone on it Fun fact 2: soulstones can be crafted Fun fact 3: dragons can be tamed by using dragon treats and soulstones can be used on them Fun fact 4: ice dragons guard silver Fun fact 5: you need a dragon eye so you can be immune to fire and lava
The og destiny 2 music feeling good
:)
You lost me at 'Survived'
rip fuck world
Plz reply
3:52 Oh no
19:46 XD

Tommy is a JoJo referance?
Flashback to when Tommy played RLCraft with Boffy
This is the best thing ever 🤣
The video title: ''I survived Minecraft's Hardest Mod'' the video:
The intro was epic
Schlatt throughout nearly this entire video is just the emoji 😄, but in like four different contexts each time.
You know its hard when the skeleton at the start of the video does 7 hearts of damage
Nmms that's like the mod that duxo and aquino just played
Already subbed but here’s a comment do this again

19:16 ah yes. “Born to die, world is a fuck” Classic r/engrish
play phasmophia with wilbur and george and that slime shit boy ;)
For some reason, this video's humor seemed more... forced than the others. Aside from that, good video.

"RLcraft is not fun it is stressful!" -CharlieSlimcicle2021
No one:    Boffy: so am I just not here?
Series time PauseChamp
T: Why are there pressure plates?  J: doors idiot C: don't make that assumption, you'll die next time - Next Time J and both dogs die in a trap by pressure plates  Should've listened to Charlie 😔  ( 2:00 - 16:26 )
Can we get more??
Schlatt hugging and kissing his cat is the serotonin I needed for my finals o7
Giorno music
The old intro
This edit is fire
Can we appreciate their rap lmao
Did he just censor his video🤬🤬🤬
Imagine if they tame a dragon in this mod
Tommy u wont see this but pls make long videos like this my friends and i like it and i am sure everyone would too :)
i will never fucking understand how charlie somehow manages to say keysmashes out loud, much less how the editor manages to FUCKING CAPTION THEM????
1:26 "am I having a heartattack?" not the first time that's happened
Tommy should do this with calvin as well as calvin knows what he is doing and could help good content still
Giornos theme is good but josukes theme is better
when tommy was rapping it was actually pretty good-
Is that destiny music
can you do a 100 days
Charlie Slimecicle returns to rlcraft to reprise his role as "recently deceased"
2:04  then 17:05...
Anyone talking about the Jojo music LMAO-
you know he is desperate now when he plays rl craft.
Big fan and you are not irritating you are funny ok tommy
Tommy: I'll play again if we get lots of subscribers  Me: You Have 9 million more than me, How many do u want
I probably wouldn't last that long. Also, rip Fuck world
bro this was a cool mod
Idk but everytime I hear Charlie, I hear him singing Fireflies. Not really complaining tho
The fact everyone's out here loving schaltt but still ignoring all the crap he's done ✨✨
I had to choose to ether watch this as soon as it came out,.. or... watching quackity’s lore stream. Sorry he is king of lore, I had too. Lol
Tommy:There is only one goal.Defeat the dungeon boss and survive.  Me:But isn't that two....?
Bruh I looked away for one second and you went from 7 million to 9 million
imma be real here i laughed more in this video than any of the others; big lad making big plans
okay this was actually sick
There rapping are actually good
Still not as hard as finding a lava pool
CONGRATS TOMMY ON 9 MILLION!!!
Tommy: “Hey there beautiful- ...you don’t have a face”   Is this why Tommy dislikes Ranboo? Because he's a faceless youtuber?
Rougelike  Hunger Overhaul  Weather 2  Deadly World  Special Mobs  EnvironMine  Mutant Creatures  Infernal Mobs  Zombie Awareness  The Spice of Life  Some of the hardest mods
Editor Larry, there are more Jojo themes.
YASSIRRRR
What mod is this?
I like he keeps saying that youtube keeps unsubscribing people from his channel, but I don't know if there unsubing intentionally, cuz I did.
Hi

Jshlatt: growls me:tries copying him and starts choking  My body: I have chosen violence

Me, I am a violent Salamander.
Not me banging to giorno theme      I'm not         I swear
Charlie:"GOD was affronted by something we said"  Schlatt: *looks at pope*

Fun Fact: If you skip to the end of a video and restart it, the ads will be gone.
20:24

Anyone in the comments and to film some vids together ? These guys are a mad inspiration!
Tommy is just stealing too much from slimecicle
Jr 2b2t be like

We need a mod vid w drista
3:53 shlat going to do...
You might hate me for saying this but make another video with this mod again pls it was too funny
That monster gave off demogorgan vibes (Idk if I spelled it right”

Tommy: tries really hard to kill the golem  Me: haha fishing rod go brrr
30 MINSS WOWWW
Rlcraft
The man is nearly at 10 million, i can't even get 25 subs┐( ∵ )┌
Did you survive RLCraft .: "Yes"  What did it cost? .: *"Everything...."*
Tommy's screams are emotionally touching and inspiring.
Am I the only one who got eight mindroll adds through the entire video
ll vento d'oro in the into was the best
Congrats on 9.09 million, you deserve it and I think you'll grow more
Tommy in it should make a 100 day hardcore series
He keep using anime intros 🧐🧐
ah yes, the two genders men likers and women enjoyers
time to watch people do the funny in modified block game again
Rl craft                        Pog
Me listening to the intro:  WAS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING JOJOS REFERENCE?!?!?!?
Me just repeating Tommy saying "shank". because of the maze runner.
Rip schlatt cat I hope his sacrifice was worth it
What is the intro music??
Bro i genuienly felt so sad when fckworld died. :,(
nobody: RLcraft expert: dude he got a ender queen crown!
Congratulations on 9mill
Tommy: What happened? Charlie; Tommy for the life of me I couldn't tell you but I think God was offended in some way.   Jschlatt: *looks at pope cardboard piece behind him and starts praying*
16:54 XD
Fuck world
may fuckworld and the "other one" rest 😔
PLZ DO 100 DAYS THIS MOD IS HARD BUT ACTUALLY POGGERS
i love the fact he’s starting to use giorno’s theme B)
HELP the way Schlatt turned towards the pope and prayed I can't-
Tommy its not a dungeon boss its a tower guardian and its not a boss its a pre boss......
24:39 That is the most feminine scream that has ever came out of Tommy’s mouth.
Love you Tommy!
That intro music just hits differnent
well that was a roller coster...
Anybody remember his playthrough with boffy?
Can you please make this a series
I only have one question does tommy watch jojo because he keeps putting il vento doro in the beginning like in know it’s a good song and all but I’m just wondering
13:12 said like a true UK man
“WOAH ITS COMING DOWN” famous last words
POV- your here on May 22 and your also here before the vid goes viral
why'd it sound like he said 'shat' at 1:20 😭😭
Don't worry schlatt, i was also born to die :D
*Best..intro song... EVER*
16:27 jschlatt -2 iq moment
*schlatt for 5 minutes* — I fell thro the floor  Tommy- Schlatt, genuinely where are you??  Schlatt- I fell thro the floor 😀
Soup
I came for Techno content, idk if he is in the video but gonna watch it right now. (Also, I love tommy's videos so I'm going to watch it anyways, just a little bit hyped because I heard that there is techno content.
I bet tommy doesnt even know what jojo is tbh
“his name is fuck world and he is dead” *schlatt starts crying* “i don’t have enough skill to eat this bread”
am i the only one that just now realized tommy got his braces off now
tommyinit hey whats up long time
This is the only mod video where tommy actually does stuff
~bird of prey~
Now tommy has evolved to slimes old role of using Girono's theme to intro videos
my only complaint is that this isnt a mod its a mod pack
eyyyy jschlatt. my fav
😀 Tommyinit is amazing 😀
Philza is actually gonna die this time lol
Its so ironic that he hates anime but uses JoJo music on his intro
You should invite boffy so you can do a four person survival
This is a modpack, not a mod, this is rlcraft
Tommy has to over take the sidemen in subscriber's that will be ridiculous
1:10 *chipmunk mode activated*
Tommy: hey there beautiful  Dark nymph: oh he’s going to ask me out. I shall take off my face.
I’d watch a part 2 of this with the same group for sure
It would be awesome if rlcraft would become a series
jschlatt: It's just a pressure plate dude later on in the video: jschlatt: IT WAS A FUCKING TRAP DUDE THE PRESSURE PLATE
hope you get sum rest tommæ
You think that’s hard
Here before 1 mil
JOJO ! GOLDEN WIND ! That theme again wow
The intro is a jojo reference
Hahahh the cat !!
Jschlatt: Am I having a heart attack? Me: sounds familiar hmm...?
part 2
if schlatt had just hit respawn once he died, neither dog would’ve died
Everyone remember Tommy said that he hates anime in his try not to laugh then why is he using JoJo bizarre adventure music🤷???????WHAT
Video: “Minecraft’s Hardest Mod”  Me: But it isn’t Minecraft’s hardest mod..... it’s Minecraft’s hardest modpack         Also me: Tommy is a dum baka
Didnt think i would ever hear Destiny music in a Tommyinnit video
I think you guys should turn this mod into a Series
for those who want more of this mod, like so that Tommy can see that we want more
Why did 'Fuckworld' create lore 😂
19:35 is that a motherfucking community reference???
IM so mad if he had just clicked respawn the dogs wouldn't have died
Tommy- •gets a horn•  Schlatt- I’m going to have some f u n with this
R. I. P. Fuck World 2021-2021
141k likes and 700 dislikes, nice
Props for using the destiny music! Really puts the sad scenes together
You should make this a series
This video is just schlatt looking terrified the entire time
This video is goat
Title says: I Survived Minecraft's Hardest Mod...  What we see in the Video: Tommy dying like 100 times
Tommy thank you so much for giornos theme
If u will do it again do it with calvin his youtube channel is cxlvxn
"Woof" -Fuckworld
Lux krake
Tommy: I survived Minecrafts hardest mod  Me: laughs in project ozone 3 kappa mode
Hardcore: Am i Joke to you?
You know it's intense when there's jojo music at the start...
Best tommyinnit video ever
ooooooooo
I know I sound like a fucking nerd but I think it was a lightning dragon the shoot lightning
Hasn't Tommy played this mod with Boffy before?
Just saw that italy won feeling super duper bad
If he had clicked respawn he could have saved fuck world and the other one
Make a series
Can we get F’s in the chat for Fuckworld and his friend?
That destiny 2 music though. Looks like they went on a Journey.
Only the real ones remember the time he played with boffy
The comment
jschlatt after getting struck by lightning: I've come to make a sacrifice
When tommy rapped remind me of "Rapping for jesus"
do a series in this pls we love to see yall suffer
after laughing my ass off at bubblebomb and other stuff i cant even talk anymore
Tommy: pushes charlie in the water for fun  Charlie: *Is assassinated*
thats the weakest boss in rlcraft
Hey tommy UK got a 0 in Eurovision
Is that a jojo reference
"FUCK. SHIT. FUCK. SHIT. DAMN IT."  -Slimecicle ~2021
How did I mostook Tommy's Theme than Giorno's Theme
Everyone: Shouting and screaming.  Schlatt: *Im stuck in a wall. :D*
HOLY 147K LIKES IN 10 MINS WORLD RECORD TF
Early
This has no business being this funny
I love how the intro always cuts off on him yelling XD
19:25 IS A BANGER
R.i.p. fuck world
Union be like: Amatours
YAY OLD INTROS ARE BACK
YES JOJO MUSIC BEST ANIME YES
ALMOST 10 MILLION WHOOO LETS GOO POP OFF KING You truly do deserve 10 mil congratulations Tommy! Lots of love ✨
I saw the title of this video and thought: I severely doubt that. Your not that good at the game Tommy.
Rip fuckworld
tommyinnit is a jojo fan?!?!?
OHHHH
He did this before with Boffy, why does Charlie need to teach him?
I want wilbur back😭
GENNK
make more Rl Craft Plz
Hmmm that intro style seems a little familiar. A super hard stress filled challenge with slimecicle and jschlatt. WAIT A MINU-
Schlatt looking back and praying to the Pope was definitely my favorite part
no pls dont pass stampy my childhood noooo
I would love that this will became a series
OMG PLEASE PLAY MORE RLCRAFT
19:08 When me and my friends where playing racing games i was supposed to say "Born To Drive" but i said "Born To Die" just like Schlatt xD
the worst thing about this is that it ruined the whole entire schedule ]:
1.5K club
17:10 the destiny music hits different 😔
“am i having a heart attack?” it wouldn’t be the first time
Sorry I’m late
RIP to the wolves
Tommy might beet miniminter to 10 mil uno
um did anyone else hear the lego batman music around 3:04
Hi
The Fact that he used Giornos Theme Song at the start
PLEASE DO RL CRAFT AGAIN
fuckworld and the other one didn't deserve that R.I.P
0:10 Is this a Jojo reference?
It's a modpack, not a mod, them calling it a mod is so annoying
I wish boffy was on this
16:16 XD
"Am I having a heart attack?" WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME JSCHLATT
Pin me please
He only beat the weakest boss LMAOOOO
My dad walked by and asked if Charlie was wearing a shirt because it matches his skin tone perfectly. Didn't realize that until he said something. XD
You should make this a series
do this again for fuckworld
The dungeon boss is the easiest just get a fishing Rob build high above him rod him alot and go to him and he's gonna fly away unless they patched it.
MY NAME IS TOMMY INNIT AND IM HERE TO SAY WE LOST fUcK WorLD IN ANOTHER WAY BAHAHAHAHAHAH
Me a Jojo enjoyer hearing Giorno's theme at the start: NANIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
I love rlcraft it’s my fav mod pack if you guys want to make a series if it. I will help if you want!
"I survived minecrafts hardest mod..."     *300 deaths later*
16:01 charliieeee yy yy yyyy u sillyyyyyyyyyyyy
when schlatt started praying i felt it
Tommy: Sees a dark nymph “HeY BeAuTiFul oh wait u got no face”
Tommy you need to make this a series, maybe stream it on twitch
Does anyone else remember some of the mods in this pack from years ago?
Me watching this video while being a god at rlcraft.
AHHHHH
Saw slimcicle and jschatt in the opening clip and knew, good video time
Dude u watch Jojo tommy?
Me efter eurovision 🤣
Fs in the chat for fuckworld
Is it rl of yeah sub to tom
when you have to be level 32 to comment
I really needed a tommy video rn so thank you
:)
This was hilarious but there was an ABSURD amount of ads :/
tommy people would be happier if you like stuck with something for more than 30 minutes, like make a mod or a game a series, play something through, you just barely scratch the surface of a lot of this stuff
Hey tommy im a kid that subscibe
I like how his sub count went up by almost 1 million in a month
That's its name dungeon boss. I never knew i have killed those so many
where's tubbo :(
Charlie yelled fuck in lower case
I hate you
NEW INTRO?!?! POG!!
I remember in 2012  I found pat and jen {popularmmos} and watched them play this, 8 years later I don't watch them now but this video bring back memories... and weird ones..
jschlatt makes me laugh a little too hard
Tommy was Naruto of that fight
11:08 Listen to this with your eyes closed
“Am I having a heart attack?” *_oh no not again_*
His mic is a little loud
I think your a little late to the party
A like all I can do
This video has already happened o:
SLIMECICLE'S RAP WAS INSANE
love how the video fucken just... opens with charlie as this ptsd-laden super jumpy chihuahua of a guy, like the time he spent in RLcraft fundamentally changed something in him and he's this dude in the woods who has been living out in the desolate pine barrens for 20 years
did not live
Do the 100 day rl craft or crazy craft
jojo's bizarre adventures in Tommy vid ?
Please make this into a series.
Do one-of them with  with dream
misson failed
Please make more videos with a guest appearance form jambo
L I V  E
DRAGON R I D E
If we get tommy to 10mil he won’t need to get fingerprints on Vik’s play-button
"he fell into lava... I fell into lava... we all fell into lava...." for some reason this has me dead
Tommy literally says "are you okay?" after jschlatt gets struck by lighting, like are you okay tommy?
8:59 "El tratado de Versalles..."
I swear Tommy actually has really good free styling skills he could be a rapper
I definitely prefer the other videos but it’s your choice of course.
At this pace tommy is gonna get to 10 million before miniminter
Everyone: get wood first RL Craft: no
Is this a jojo reference
Didn't he play this with Boffy awhile ago. Love that he doesn't remember some things.
1:09 is all im going to say
hes playing the first mod i ever played, combined with rl craft
Soup
Lol
you know tommy is in some serious **** when the intro is JOJO MUSIC
Nice giorno theme
Bro its 2 am I want to watch it so bad but its too late And Im sure I will enjoy more on the morning
He’s back the legend is back
Why did journey from d2 play when fuckworld died
17:52 Highlight of my day
Born to die -jschlatt:2021

The way schlatt started praying to the pope was kind of funny-     And no Christians/ Catholics do NOT offer things the way he did lmfao-
JOJO
tommy is cool cuz he screams that’s why I sub IMAO
broo the jojo music
Cool
7:50 hearing jschlat scream is like hearing an angle sing
This isn't a mod, it's THE modpack
POGGERS

U should do a colab w forge labs
Literally stayed up to see this am lucky
F world rip

Jshlatts cat:  Every twitch chat: SOUP
Shlatt: Halo be thee name they kingdom come i will be done- me Knowing the full thing: **saying along with**
#ripfuckworld
you can tame the birsds with avian treats and stop the clickbait
Noone: Tommy in his thumbnails: ƈʀɨռɢɛ
There is Destiny 2 soundtrack in this video. The fact that I recognized it is surprising
this isn't 1000% funnier
If we’re getting technical or craft isn’t a mod it’s a modpack
tommy jojo fan?
alas, poor fundy
*Top 20 saddest anime deaths #1* _fuckworld_
*gasp* is Tommy innit getting more kidfriendly?!?!   waits a few minutes   hah no, no he's not...
I think if they tried playing on Wynncraft together that would be really funny....
Rest in peace Fuckworld 2021-2021 o7
26:24 Is this CALAMITY MOD MUSIC???
RIP f*ck world
Hardest mod pack
whoever picked the music for the end battle: *chef's kiss*
"you do not meet the requirements to survive"
Hi Tommy there are 1000s of bots in the comments and replies,  including ones that are impersonating YOU
fuckworld our beloved
Love the new intro
I could hear "KONO DIO DA" In the background music
RIP
15:45 Ummm Schlatt i think you have a lot of explaining to do..
Tommy: hello beautiful 😏 oh- you don’t have a face 😶
17:30 tommy is playing a destiny 2 red war song
Schlatt: am i having  aheart attack? Basically everyone: ... crap
9 Mil? Tommy’s sub count is speed-running
RIP F*** world
you can use me as "make another rlcraft video" button
18:44
NOOOOO F***WORLD
o7 for fuckworld
When the swear words are used in the first two minutes, you know the video is going to be intense
I’ve cried every time I’ve played this mod. It’s still one of my favorites
Jschlatt has a better origin story than most comic heros do
I was very confused when you didn't post yesterday, but I like the video!
17:12 a prime example of society
WTF YOU'RE STEALING MY NAME NOW TOMMY! 8:05
Rip fuckworld and the other dog
Me having watched Cxlvxn " Ha Ha Ha Ha this is nothing"
Jschlatt scared me when he turned to his priest poster ;-;
If he had respawned the dogs would have teleport
They're skilled enough to fight off aliens, but not skilled enough to eat a carrot.
RLcraft speedrunners: pathetic
This is the most work I've ever seen jschlatt do.
LMAO ITS LAZERING YOU RUN BAHAHAH 😀
Giornos theme :D
TOMMYINIT WATCHES JOJO
blast to the past
Am I the only one who know what the beginning music was
The jojo music fits this video a lot.
Literally everyone is posting before George
rip fuckworld
Every time u post a vid I be sitting next to my family and I know u gonna be talking bout sexual stuff😂😂😂✋
Jesus Christ 9 ads? Thank God for adblock
DESTINY MUSIC THE CHANNEL JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER
HOLY FUCKING SHIT IS THAT A MOMTHERFUCKING JOJO REFERENCE!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Why when fuck world died it was actually sad
IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE?~
I found this mod I hated it
can we just appreciate the ppl who just casually does this in hardcore and is wayyyy better than tommy and his friends?
This video was hilarious, especially with Schlatt and Charlie! I think you should also try the 100 days videos, give it a try if you want! Anyways good video!
Do this again
I swear this is literally the funniest video tommy posted i choked multiple times
FUCKWORLD NOOOOOOO
Fuck vill
Would love for this to be a series, I want them to fight a dragon and temperature
Yay
Jambo is now a part of tommyinnit lore
finally, tommy and RLcraft; part 2
Can we take a moment to appreciate how from Pirates to this vid, Tommy never fails to think up lyrics for freestyle raps?
bingus babushca
welp, i'm never doing that...
Og ssundee fans where you at?! This mod is just too easy for ssundee mc seriesHAHAHH LMAOO
9 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS WELL DONE TOMMY!
ironic how schlatt said something about pressure plates at the start then fuckworld died from a pressure plate trap
Rip fuckworld
6:18  Zeus: so please let me introduce myself
pogggers
The way he says hello at 24:34 feels so much like an elder scrolls noc
I'm so happy they're playing rlcraft lol
gaming
Anyone remember when he played this with boffy?
I can confirm this video reminds me of my past
Am the only one who thought that Technoblade was in this video
Do it again
MORE RLCRAFT PLEASE
My favorite part was the rap: 17:49
Why is Schaltt sacrificing soup to his priest cardboard cut out?
Can I get this comment to 420 like or the funny number
Jschlatt: gets struck by lighting Tommy: are u ok..? Jschlatt: *prays and sacrifices his cat*
This mod was actually funny dude
BOWSERS FURY OST
You should actually make a series of this
MORE
if rlcraft is hard, does thia make enigmatica2 impossible
HOLD ON ISNT THIS THE MOD PHIL AND SCHLATT PLAYED? yeah i just realised schlatt literally said he remembers it from hexxit
Is it just me or tommy is suprisingly good at beatbox (idk what its called)
:O i started watching at 1mil subs Good Job bruv
im late rip
I love how the swears were bleeped out in the beginning for 30 seconds, then they just said screw it XD
"My left arm is damaged, am I having a heart attack?" - Jshlatt, 2021

First of all tommy gets 1mil subs every month and 2nd is tommy a jojo fan now?
RLcraft is da worst and this just made me feel better knowing that I also don't suck at the mod
THIS VIDEO IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES SO FAR! AMAZING JOB TOMMY!
Ily Tommy for respecting women when people around you don't! ❤️❤️
12:38 IS THIS LORE?!
Knowwon:    Tommy:  His name was fuckworld and now hes dead, i dont have enogh skill to eat this bread.
Jschlatt: the dog can’t speak English  Slimecicle: He’s actually completely fluent in Spanish
A series maybe?
When you realize tommy went up 1.4 million subs within a week not including me bc I subbed a month ago
You should "beat RLCraft".
Slimecicle: *God was affronted by something we said.*  Schlatt: *Starts ritual with sacrificing Jambo to pope*
He really copied the beat of the scarn from the office lmao
lesson 1: *your not safe*
Let’s get tommy to 10 mil
Pls mod vid with dream
They defeated the weakest boss
Everytime tommy says charlie it sounds like the 'ow charlie you bit me" kid
RIP Fuckworld 2021-2021
YEAAAAA
That’s slimecicle’s intro for his rl craft.  HOLY SHIT
reminds me of the battletowers in dantdms old diamond dimensions world :)
this is not the hardest mod lmao
I’ll stick with my soft mods, thanku
I you are a true slimecicle Sub you know the pain he when through
Wait is jschlatt gay?
the music at the beginning: starts  me: IS THIS A FUCKING JOJO REFERENCE?
WE LOVE THE BEGINNING MUSIC
Booba
I like how tommy was playing destiny 2 music when fuckworld died
We have the meat and the mayo. We need the bread in these videos now.
Can you credit the music you use in your videos in like the description or something?
Series???
Rip fuckworld  2021-2021  Rip other wolf  2021-2021
That giornos theme at the begining of the Video was epic
YouTube: how many ads you want?  Tommyinnit: yes
Me at 2 AM: trying to sleep  That one mosquito: 4:13
He blocked of the fs
30min feel like 2 hours.. 24min feels like 5min  WHATS WRONG WITH ME!!? I like it BTW :)
TOMMY INNIT ROAD TO 10MILLION SUBS YOUR CLOSE TO DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON
3:52 schlatt, what are you doing with the hornnnn
Aaay I love RL craft :)
3:38 Must be a controller player
is i just me who thinks that this should be a series
7:38 When my urine its red
i dare dream to speedrun this.
GIORNOS THEME AT THE START POG
I like how schlatt could have respawned and fuckworld would have teleported back
I HAD SUBSCRIBED
Tommy jojo fan?
I need more of this it was one off your best videos
0: ten million, come on boys
This thing was dope as hell
Bro I literally teared up a little because of fuck world😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😿😿😿 it's a sad day on earth

Jojo
Bro not gonna lie I really want a part 2
Does Tommy remember that he played this with boffy like a year ago
JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOJJJOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
May Fuck world Rest In Peace 😔✋
Oh my god this reminded me of the series of Shlatt and Phil-
Get big man to 10M for his girl
7:36 is now one of my favourite Jshclatt scenes
Oh man i they invited Boffy too it would be so much fun to watch
Thats one s tier weapon in the 🇬🇧
Day 1 of asking for tommy fan art as Giorno Giovanna.
This Jschlatt guy is pretty funny, he should start streaming on twitch
Me realizing that Tommy has played rlcraft in a different vid and knows how to play the game in the other vid but not this one...
there is a jojo reference in the video
the funny thing about the golem is that that fight would have lasted less than a minute if they just used a fishing rod to fling it away
Wait- when did Tommy start blurring swears
There’s only one place you are safe the death screen
The hardest mod. Plays a modpack.  Also title: I survived Me: sure did the opposite of surviving.
Only OGs will remember that tommy already made a video on this mod
Fuck world hit different
18:31 where... where did he learn that?
Charlie  sounds like eminem
the spanish speaking dog reference 🙏
Socks for one =today I damloded every single mod!!
Tommy: Our goal is to kill the dungeon boss and survive Forge Lab killing the biggest dragon and hatch his egg for a pet: Pathetic
I am before 5 mins lets gooo
I fr got anxiety and flashbags when tommy edit that herobrine picture
24:37 man scream
Rip fuckworld 2021-2021
why was i so freaking sad when schlatt's dogs died- its literally just a gameeee-
Imagine manhunt....
I wish I could double subscribe
Let's goooo this is a really funny and good video also you gonna jump in a cadillac
I loved this is so much everyone’s humour fits together perfectly it’s incredible 🙌
This is so good  Really Epic
you guys suck at beatboxing
schlatt “am i having a heart attack”    🎶i reminisce about a past life🎶
You just made me dance on my chair thanks to golden wind
lol this is rlcraft. you are NOT equipped for this. and please mention this is a modpack called rlcraft in the intro, don't not mention the people who made it
getting off at the end of quackity's lore stream to watch tommy be like
holy shit hes actually going to beat minimiter
no one: slimecicle:“It’s a chupacabra they’re real!”
Finally slime circle is now usefull 😂😂😂
Hollah who?
im so proud of you tommy, you’re almost at 10 mil! you grew so fast! i first saw you when you were at around 2-3 mil, i’m so proud of how much and how quick you grew. <3
This should be a series 😂
AYO THE A HAT IN TIME MUSIC????
Schlatt: “am i having a heart attack?”  *ah, shit. here we go again*
Old style intro yes
jesus christ
I remember when techno and schlatt played rlcraft and it was just as chaotic
Whats the song at 0:26
reminds me of the old video of tommy playing rlcraft with time deo XD
The earliest I’ve ever been to a video 😂
YOU FRICK YOU UPLOADED AT SATURDAY NOT FRIDAY
THANKYOU FOR POSTING KING!
Does anybody notice that Tommy uses cuphead music?
The pure FEAR on Jschlatts face then  ENTIRE TIME THO.
28:15 look at that mlg block clutch boy oh buddy oh pal, he would have taken so much more damage if he wasn't able to place a singular block down to save himself.      The edit was that I put 18:15 instead of 28:15
your videos make me so happy thanks so much for making my day!
RL craft
#landitknightlivesforever
congrats on 9 mil :D
Happy 9mil
I like how he said "I survived the hardest mod" like he already did it with Boffy
3:17
yeah a 100 day video would be cool too
Love the community reference
a spider spawned on my bed while I was watching this video I'm not okay
tommy is just mmmmm
GET A DRAGON
You know it's gonna be awesome when Tommy uses Jojo music in the intro
1 MILLION!!!!! (soon)
It should be I attempted to survive the hardest mod
tommy watches jjba?
Does anyone remember when Tommy played rlcraft with Boffy?
I never knew I wanted an RL Craft playthrough with Tommy, JSchlatt, and Charlie but holy **** this was hilarious.
this is so cursed..... *i love it*
30 MINUTES 🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍GOOD DAY FOR THE INNITERS☺️☺️☺️😵‍💫😵‍💫🤣🤣😂😂😂🍷
Schlatt: Am i having heart attack? *L'manburg intensifies*
someone named world watching this: *visible sadness*
3:01 Who hears the lego batman music?
The giorno theme in the intro was pretty epic not gonna lie...
Ngl I really like this video type! Maybe even more than than the usual format!
He should do a 100 days
Fuck world
Rlcraft isn’t even that hard
not gonna lie i would love to see Phil play this mod with Tommy or the dream team play it
How.
1:25   " am I having a heart attack?! "  Oh not again schlatt
This is the funniest video ever!
This came out at 5 in the morning   Tommy you officially made my day
If only you knew the Calvin strat
whats the intro song?
Foreshadowing: 2:07 Result: 16:25
TOMMMY
Tommy: Oh no no not anime.         Also Tommy: Uses music in intro from anime*
Let's get tommyinnit to 10 mil bois subscribe now
best jojo reference as the intro
I won't mind if they make this as a series
100 days rlcarft
... Jotoro's theme... 0:30 DIO
jschalt just respun
Um.... AcTuAlLy iT iS a mOdPaCk, nOt a mOd
i gotta say it, JOJOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DA DA DA DADADADD GOLDEEEENN WINDDDDDDDDD
U should do one with u, techno, shlaat, and tubbo
schlatt I don't think your sacrafice worked
You got to use the GIRLFRIEND mob that will be perfect for Tommy😂🤣😂
HOLY SHIT ALMOST 10milion?????!! POG
Charlie is really having flash backs
I ditched watching this video for a Quackity lore stream
Omg i Love Rl-craft spend way to mutch time with that Mod  This is a wish come true 😂
no one: Tommy pretending to be dream: 22:38
IT'S A MODPACK NOT A MOD WHY DOES EVERYONE CALL IT A MOD
SCHLATT'S CAT IS A MOOD LMAOOO
The Destiny 2 music when he died lol
sorry im late tommy i was watching big Qs stream
Schlatt adds "big" to any word and it would sound good.
please do a rlcraft smp
Make him get dim and play button
Loved this video man! You should have Schlatt and Wilbur in a video!
Hi
This is just 99% Schlatt screaming his head off and 1% everything elss
Fuckworld
Best one ever
Nobody: Schlatt: *offering jambo as a sacrifice*
video recap just sky block but more entertaining
Throwback mod videos sound fun   *why are these videos so funny*
This has to be the best video yet, when Jschlatt turns around to see Pope Francis after being struct by lightning
Didn’t Tommy play this mod with boffy that one time
This is epic video
why was youtuble allowed to take control of ads...
also keep in mind that this isnt even close to the actual final boss(es)
>o< f you
I remember playing this with my brother fun times fun times that was
The entire part when Schlatt turns to the Pope and starts doing some random stuff is the most funniest thing to me. Wait- why does the pope look like it’s m o r e then a 2D cardboard cutout..... Schlatt- I- did you- nevermind.
LOVED this please do more RL craft stuff
My fave mod vid so far BSVSUDJE
Tommy please tell me that you watch jojo cuz you have been recently adding giornos theme and a remix
if this mod doesn’t become a series imma riot
giving my prediction before the video: they fail.
Reminds me of Philza and Schlatt's Hexxit series. Good times!
imagine the dsmp with this mod
You didn't survive shit Tommy. You DIED SEVERAL TIMES. Big ass difference here
The amount of Giornos theme in Tommy’s videos is giving me so many good vibes.
Ok actually am I the only one who remember 's that tommyinnit already did this mod back like a year or two ago with somebody?
3 idiots playing RLCraft is what u needed
Who will win the ten million subs race
This video made my day- I was having a somewhat terrible day but this video made it better! Thanks Big Man!
Loved the Bowser's Fury theme boss battle at the end when they were versing the golem
If Jshclatte had respawned both wolves would have survived
I've watched so much RLCraft and watching someone new play it is as infuriating as ever
“let it be sleep”
“Mans got a shank”
forge labs did 200 days in rlcraft in HARDCORE, but he died a few times.
I want this as a let’s play series
LET GOOOO GET TO 10M SUB
POG
For his 10 million subscribers special he should meet back with business bay and wisp
Congrats on 9 mill
Shame fuckworld never went platinum
The timing on this is insane. Started playing rlcraft maybe half a week ago.
Please 100 days hardcore regular or modded and please do more mods like orespawn
The fact it did a zoom in on Tommy's face at the end when he was in the ski
The trite barometer unintentionally remember because cart genetically relax given a wakeful newsprint. joyous, unequal caution
Yoo
Schlatt's dog dripped so much he drowned
I would want to see more
Schlatt repenting his sins was the funniest thing ever 😂
No one cares about the giornos theme
Did not expect to hear the Destiny music, but I am not disappointed
tommy already played this with boffy and seems like he forgot btw seems like tommy is good at mods but not editing audio LuL
Oml I can't imagine if they meet a dragon
I dont have skills to sub Tommy );
Tbh when I saw the vid title I thought it was a joke but I was wrong XD
dragon next.
Petition for tommy to make a rap song
Slimecicle is experiencing some PTSD
i love how he learned from charlie by using remixes of giorno's theme for the intros
Rip Fuck World ———————— 2021-2021 Only if Glatt didn’t fuxk it up
and people ask me why i like schlatt ✋🏻😭
Pls play more
Just came from Quackity's lore stream, it was A-mazing✨👏
This video was posted on my birthday. Cool
Can you link the mods you use?
Oaky, just so you know, its a modpack, not a mod.
moment of silence for fuckworld...
Tommy we have 2 things in common: one the Qween is the best, two women are gods 🙌
Slimecicle looks like he's not wearing a shirt and it looks weird
Is this part 2 of Schlatt dies of a heart attack?
Rip Fuckworld
Good old Jojo music
Is it a bird, is it a plane? No its a VIOLENT SALAMANTA
i swear tommy already played this mod with boffy (i think that the name lol)
lmaooo this reminds me of the rlcraft series he did with boffy like forever ago, genuinely cant believe tommy’s almost at 10 mil. congrats big man!!!
Imagine the dream SMP playing this as a new series.... Nice
I'm just gonna say it, R.I.P. Fuckworld and their sibling
I had forgotten about this mod and now I want to subject my friends to it
woa schlatt
i remember tommy and boffys rl craft videos
Dang, Epic Giorno's theme in the bg :3
I feel like tommy might be the only youtuber who makes me enjoy the whole subscribe speech
Bruh tommy now uses the giorno theme, ive been using giorno theme. AND IM A THOMAS
THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE FUNNIEST VIDEOS EVER LMAOOO
This has to be the funniest video of them all Not joking
Never in my life would I ever have thought that I would hear jschlatt growl 😂
POV you came here from the quackity stream just now: 😭😭😭😭😭

I remember when you did this with Boffy
16:00

I need that rap on Spotify
Jschlatt: Am I having a heart attack?  DSMP Fans: OH NO NOT AGAIN

My chests hurts everywhere from laughing because when i have had somethinh really cold i laugh 10x easier and 10x more

I really hope this becomes a series, it was really entertaining and this trio has a lot of potential i think
Today we only have one goal... *Names two goals
RIP Fuckworld pay the respects.
Tommyinit use giornos theme Me:what the
Schlatt: My left arm is damaged, am I having a heart attack. Me: Oh no, not again **wheezing** why was that the first thing that came to mind 🤣
My brother played the same lol
Its funny that an anime song is in the beginning,and tommy hates anime😂😂
I’d like to Watch more episodes of this. It’s hilarious.

The editor gave up on blurring the curses. My thought: there too much of it
kjhnb
Why sm ads wtf
Tommy: *in video to host it* Charlie: *in video to be the guide* Schlatt: *in video to make it 1000 times funnier*
Does anybody think he should do part 2    Because I do
this funny
Charlie's having PTSD playing RL craft again
:0 almost 10 mill subs :0
I- I'm only 6 minutes in, I've already been through so much edit: well, that was an experience...
Fuckworld sounds like a club

TGHSI IS GREAT

I got a bleeding nose watching this video for some reason
E
9:52 XD
18:44 Why was that flow actually kind of a banger
Tommy’s bars GO HARD

30 minutes of pure chaos
Destiny 2 music at 17:10
10 rappers M&M was afraid to diss    10. Tommy Innit '' His name was fuck world now hes dead, Im not skilled enough to eat this bread"
This comment won’t get pinned
Charlie, Jshlatt, And Tommy.... The most iconic and Chaotic Trio ever
Yo Tommy might win on getting 10 mil before miniminter
no one noticed jshclat drowned whilst trying to escape a creeper
1:05 listen to Tommy's squeal
8:57 dogy skilled in spanish XD
Well, technically, RLCraft is not a single mod, it's a modpack.
I'm glad Schlatt brought up the Hexitt series. Those vids were hilarious (just like this one)!
tommy is not posting in dream:(😢
Giorno Giovanna?😳
Can you do a part two?
This was very enjoyable to watch! I want more of this
poor Charlie is acting like a war veteran
At 6:33 when slimeicle said " im that god affronted him" and jschlatt look behind him and see the, I laughed so hard
Tommy should do 100 days
9 MIL! LAST TIME I CHECKED YOU HAD 6! Poggers
RL CRAFT OMG YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS Tommy I've been subbed since 2019 it's been an honor to see you play rl craft again but not with boffy also I like how charlie ran in front of the tree when he knew he would die from it.
NICE ONTRO
I wish they placed the bed on the first floor.
More moded videos
FUCKWORLDDDDD
Plz god do more of rlcraft
30 min video am i in the heaven??
R.I.P Fuckworld, he was the best dog and his growls sent the best rappers to their knees
Does anyone else see that Charlie had no shirt
Fuckworld :'(((( is dead
All I can focus on is the jojo music in the beginning I can't anymore
21:51 pp
With my knew pc I can actually play rlcraft (after I fix my fucked up directories of course)
Tommy are u a fan of Jojo's bizarre adventure?
Shlatt: Am I having a heart attack   Me:.....Dream SMP flashbacks
This gave me hardcore hexxit vibes
You need to play with Boffy!
3:08 this is so funny to me
Hasnt schlatt and Phil beat this? In hardcore mode? Though then again they sort of revived themselves a few times.
Tommy you should do a crazy craft video!! I just think it would be a cool idea :))
The ups and downs, the rising tension, the storytelling. Truly a piece of art-
Yes
Oh my god. Giorno's theme again? Is Tommy a JoJo fan???
*jojo music intensifies*
This was a really cool video! I also love the Bowser's Fury music 😀
Why does every time I watch tommy init he gets 500k subs every ( new )vid I watch
R. I. P Fuck World
This is literally just a slimecicle video and I wouldn't have it any other way
Any poggers ealy late for one hour ?
YOURE ONE DAY LATE HVIHDEOI
Jameson
9:49 hold up that’s train rush from a hat in time, come to think of it a lot of Tommy’s music is a hat in time music
Oh how lovely, i subbed and have been watching every video since bout half a year ago and yt unsubbed me prolly cause they think "No real person could stand Tommy for the long hes gotta be a bot"
plays a wolf
Have the cuss words always been scratched out because it's driving me nuts
Was Tommy acting in the beginning or something? He's played rlcraft before
If you think that this was hard FORGE LABS DID RLCRAFT FOR 200 days
So are we not gonna talk abt 7:45?
Tommy is slowly becoming British slimecilce

Jojo music in the intro makes it bettter
21:00 _PHOENIX WRIGHT VIBES INTENSIFIES_
Very Nice destiny music
Schlatt praying and looking at the Pope was great
For the 1st time tommy didn't got 1m views in 1hr.

6:20 r/ihadastoke

Congrats on 9 mill Tommy!!! Youve grown so much these past few weeks!😊
wait didn't he already play this with boffy?? surely he knows how rlcraft works after doing a multi part series on it lmao /nm
Super sonic speed tatatatatatata . I have a good idea . The list is not a valid email address to send me an details . I think the last few years ago. I have a look and feel. I am very pleased that the new year is going to have the right now, and a few minutes to any network of independent and I have to be a bit more. The comments for the first time. The list of the 2nd floor and the other day. I have a good time to do it for a couple more weeks 2. This email address to receive 21st century. I think I might have been made to order the UK.
didnt tommy do this with boffy and never did a part two?
Fun Fact:You can find "naked" yoga on YouTube.
You know it is going down when the Jojo music is at the beginning.
Pls do another video but a series on this it was rlly funny
o7 fuck world
Fuck worlds death is the most tragic death I have ever witnessed
Finally no shit they just try to beat the game
21:10 what's the music? it's so familiar yet I have no idea
8:27 XDdhvhfjv
When you hear jojo music you already know its gonna be serious
Schlatt: _Gets struck by lightning_   Tommy: First time?
F in chat for FuckWorld :C
Tommy should make this a series
It's not just kill a dragon it's just a dungeon boss
We have to enjoy the video cause they didn't ok guess?
modpack*
“Hes thinking of something messed up rn” Says Tommy as Schlatt hugs and kisses his cat.
"Born to die"         -Jschlatt 2021
I genuinely got scared when Schlatt started praying
0:05 Fundy: *[Sad Fox Noises]*
I love how far Tommy has come. I am so happy for him

MOD PACK: RLCraft by Shivaxi  youtube.com/user/Shivaxi
Please let this turn into a series
Use me as a "do a video with boffy" button
Charlie:WOAA ITS COMIN' DOWN      * *instantly gets crushed by tree**
You know if Schlatt respawned as soon as he died, maybe Fuck World and the other dog might have lived.
You should do the twilight forest mod
The use of Journey from destiny 2 was good until it was ruined
whoever the editor of this vid is, u did good boss man
yup this pretty much sums up rlcraft               death and suffering
Noice we got a sequel
Ngl, Tommy, Charlie, and Schlatt are one of the best rapper groups I've ever heard
so is this canon?
Btw, this mod is called RLCraft
6:53 nooooo kittyy
Lol the golem is the easisest boss in RLcraft
Yeah I liked this video it was super funny and entertaining
Sec. I have a look at the moment. The comments for the use the information you give us your comments, and a few days. The comments for the first time, the more you will need the following link
24:35 is my favorite part
Please make this a series
okay but the fact that tommy actually popped off and thought of a good rap that rhymed was good asf
MAN I wish Tommy would get a better friend to record with than fucking Schlatt Poor kid really shouldn't be letting himself be influenced by a stoner who looks like he owns a confederate flag
jokes aside giornos theme golden wind is actually banger
They had the destiny 2 sound track when fuck world died
Do more please!!!
Tommy: *does intro stuff* Me: *vibin to golden wind in the background*
Finally, you have 9 million subs
Did NOT expect destiny 2 music but bravo
You are sick you need help with your new home. I have a look at the moment. The comments for your help. I have a look at the moment. The comments for your help. I have a look at the moment. The comments for your help. I have a look at the moment. The comments for your help.
Hello
The thirsty bracket assembly consider because journey classically flap into a swift slipper. gorgeous, puzzling goat
RLcraft yeh?
The reason Jschlatt is kinda good with this is because he did Hexxit Hardcore for a bit with Philza, and it's a bit similar.
pog
I would hardly call this “survived”
Early-ish 😁
5:08 bru
F world o7

Fake
There should be a dream smp election for one new member to join, that would be soo cool
You should do one of these challenges in hardcore mode!
6:17 XD

I just noticed that tommy hit 9kk subscribers
If philza was here video will be 15 minutes because he would carry all of you guys.

Charlies having way flashbacks
17:09  Rip Fuckworld and the other one :"v

Tommy likes men like fr fr he told me 4K

Fuckworld NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Good morning tommy and hi

Nobody  Schlatt: my left arm is damaged am I having a heart attack?

These are just the funniest videos ever
I love how all of his videos start off with the swears censored and then like two minutes into it they just give up with it 🤣
Damn 30 min
nobody white people rapping  my name is _ and im here to say
Imagine in real life, instead of saying you're not old enough to eat this food, you're not skilled enough to eat this food.
Yooo, the lil' british boy got 9 mil
anyone remember when he did RLCraft with boffy?
Rip fuckworld
Thanks Tommy for the reminder to Sub. YouTube strangely unsubscribed me.

4:39 XD charli -2 iq moment
In all of tommy innit's video... This is the best one.
Rip fuckworld

You stole Charlie music for intro
Look I don't want to be *"that"* guy but   What's the intro song?

Hi
A video that didn’t had funniest mod ever finally
R.I.P fuck world. I like it how Tommy puts and the other one in the grave. Today with you Tommy woman lovers
I like how all the swearing starts of bleeped out but then the editor just gives up
thank you tommy for brightening up my day :D
Charlie’s RLcraft PTSD really does show  *Rip Condi and Grizzly*
Tommy playing destiny 2 music when the dogs died.
I think that sad music during the death was destiny 2 music
Slime and jschlatts dynamic is fuckin amazing
I can’t believe I’m in a tommyinnit video
I need more
The intro is telling me that Tommy is  a jjba fan
4:28 ew
When you realize that TommyInnit made this video a year ago
Cool, but can you do that again
Jojo music love it
The music is giving me Jtoh vibes
This video is really cool
6:20 Susan Wojcicki :)
My bestest 30 minutes of my life :D
1 like for fuckworld is also 1 hug for jschlatt
I can't believe they suffered through so much RL craft for only ONE video 😂 like that mod is something else
"Born to die" That made me smile :)
god theyre so painfully white
Ack last week YouTube unsubscribed me
Damn did slime do the editing on this one?
You guys should play orespawn
10:45 hey that’s me
3:41 DELTARUNE :DD
Its a modpack
Lets have a moment of silence for Fuckworld
Anyone else remember when he played this with boffy?
This was not something I was expecting to see, but I'm glad it's happening nonetheless. Full RLCraft playthrough when?
My Gosh, tries To sacrifice his Cat and goes "Bro wtf" I'm dying of laughter rn LMAO 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I never knew I would cry over a dog named fuckworld
Forge labs casually surviving Rl craft like a boss
BROOoO GIORNOS THEME HELL YEAh
Ice and fire is such a good mod
Now, how about you survive the Calamity Mod for Terraria?
This was really funny! XD
CONGRATS ON 9 MIL!! The mod looks weird lol
Hi
Charlie and I are both experiencing ptsd from his video
i was laghing with my mouth open is that how you lagh idk even know
I can’t believe tommy watched jojo. So proud of him
Oh no *Oh no* _I KNEW IT, THE JOJO MUSIC FADES IN OH_ *GOD* *THEY'RE GONNA DIE SO MUCH* Edit: _OH MY HOLY GOD THIS WAS AN UNDERSTATEMENT_
I forgot Slimecicle played this before.
:O is this season 2 because last few years you got the mod and played it with boffy.
I want this to be a series
jshat ruins it
should’ve done this with Boffy for the nostalgia
At i the only one who thinks the editing looks different this vid it’s better in my opinion
Fuckworld
Where is grandpa Phill?!;(
You should try calvins severe craft
Bro do 100 days in RL craft with like schlatt,wibur,tubbo,phil etc.
Pls notice me
The video is always good with jshlat or slimsicale or Wilbur 😂😂
Having schlat in these new vids wus a fucking right choice
LateInit
F for Fuckworld o7
Why boss looks like a among us character
Charlie's smile at the end is just MMMMMmm
R.I.P fuckwrold
No pls don’t mess up your upload schedule
Jschlatt: *died from the god* Soup: my time has come
Pog another mod vid
This was the perfect moment for TommyInnit to craft a belt
Imagane dream manhunt to be in this mod lol
Jschlatt: *gets struck by lightning*  Everyone: omg wow thats so weird  Jschlatt: *praying*
The royal reaction supposedly whistle because reindeer intermittently rock afore a aggressive plain. wakeful, heady footnote
Schlatt: struck by lightning Praying intensifies.
Every good rapper dies FuckWorld was no exception  R.I.P - FuckWorld: 2021-2021
Let me know if you guys enjoyed this type of video! Who knows... if you guys like this... those 100 days videos sound pretty fun to do >:)
ima like it for the jojo music
bro we need a a shkield. 😂
for all you have who have never heard of RL craft watch other YouTubers for once
HAY BB
Y’all remember when he played this with boffy?
This is a Good Video
i wish i could like this video more than once
Jschlatt: "My left arm is damaged"  Also Jschlatt: "Am I having a heart attack?"
11:50 *Vietnamese Ph1lza&Schlatt HEXXIT flashbacks*
This is the easiest mode ever, this mod is for baby's
not me watching this during quackitys lore
oh boy the old intros are back
can i just say (and i'm not a hater) you're know where near 10 mill you have 110K left to go thats alot
whats the music at 5:12?
6:21 How did someone capture the exact letters to captions that.
Continue this
again
Schlatt: Im I having a heart attack every dream smp fan: not again
Y is there 10 ads
Tommy: "screaming" Charlie: "I want to be unborn" Schlatt: "I'm literally stuck in a wall"
10:46 “BIG HOUSE” JUST LIKE “BIG PRISON” LMFAOOOOOO
4:41  Valheim moment:
the pope tho...
This video was fire and best people to do it with, I hate the ones where you fight eachother it’s mad boring
Jschlatt when he got struck by lightning: most horrifing face  6:25 XD
Am I the only one that actually teared up when both of Jschlatt’s dogs fell into the lava
"But he's actually very fluent in spanish" *flashbacks to anime voice camp*
Slenderman? Ranboo? Oobnar?
Everyone else"How do we play?" charlie:* E X T R E M E   P T S D*
Only 22 seconds in I’m guessing it’s Crazy Craft Troll Craft  One Life and X life all in one
Why am I genuinely sad that fuckworld is dead?
Wait, didn't you do this with Boffy like a year ago?
tommy said he wants beat RLCraft tower golem as a big thing little did he darn know...    ...*that's just a toy compared to the true beasts*
W a i t - Am i insane or didn’t he play rl craft with the YouTuber BoffyYT? Cause I could have sworn he did-
Thanks tommy Charlie and schlatt for making my birthday so much better
Dwagon time
At 6:20 Charlie sounded like courage the cowardly dog
Imagine this but with tubbo, wilbur and philza. Amazing
schlatt needs to renew his skills with another hexxit hardcore with Ph1lza  and of course he is still left the dirty work of killing the mobs while someone else loots the chests in the tower
rip fuckworld
Congrats on 9 mill Tommy!
Giorno theme aaaaaaaaaa
Jschlaat just looking at the Pope breaks me
sussy
a

I read the title of the video, saw the first 15 seconds, realized Schlatt was in it then I stopped playing the video,  left my house to go to the store and I got snacks since I knew this was going to be his biggest *Mod* video yet
Tommy’s taste in music is top tire
Rip Fuck World
Did Tommy just use a Slimecicle intro?!
Giornos theme in the back ground Tommy I thought you DIDNT LIKE ANIME?
They can just use bow and fishing rod trick
Damn this is intense
✝️ GOD AND JESUS ARE COMING. REPENT FROM YOUR SINS BEFORE IT’S TOO LATE. THERE IS SO MUCH PROOF OF GOD!!! I DON’T WANT YOU TO GO TO HELL!!!! SPREAD THE  OF GOD PLEASE (I’m not forcing you)✝️ :)

15:38  Charlie: Httyd. The chat: *Cursed velociraptor*.
Epic 9 million
I started laughing so hard when jschlatt started the sacrifice bit
Do you watch jojo by any chance?   (Going off of the intro music )
I really liked this video!! I don't have a really funny comment or whatever, but I'd personally love to see it as a 100 days video
Fundy: (grabs imposible++ mode) am I a joke to you

o7 fuckwrld lowkey kinda sad 😔
this was actually tommy's best video in ages. they were joking but seemed to be enjoying what they were playing. more please :)
Anyone remember when Tommy did this mod with boffy?
Tommy: *doesn’t like anime?* Also him: *uses Giornos theme from Jojos Bizarre adventure*
Gorino theme remix in the backround is very good
3:49

F for the wolfs
#Freepalastine

16:29 if he respand none of his dogs woud have died
If this is the hardest mod then gregtech new horizons should be easy peasy huh?
This reminds me of the days    When you played this with Boffy
I spent 100 day with jschlatt And dragons
Why does charlie's rap remind me of  hamilton
Any mod is the hardest mod without Philza to carry them
Jschlatt: gets struck by lightning  Charlie: freaks out Tommy: are you ok- Jschlatt: prays intensely
Love how the editor immediately gave up on censoring about 2 minutes in xD
orespawn+ whatever this mod is defeat every boss
NOOOO FUCKWORLD
Anyone else also get terrified by the herobrine bit or was that just me from getting scared really easily 😂
Tommy making it to 10 mil before techno makes me sad
Of only they knew that people bet this on hardcore XD
You should have more anime music at the start
The new intro... POG bruh I already know it will be funny
I dont know what the problem of mcyt is but, youtube doesn't unsub anyone. No one I know has that problem
Why’d you post on a Saturday but not yesterday?
TOMMYYYYYY
Yessir
I have a very good idea  Play phasmophobia it could be fun to watch:))
10:56 shclatt did the lesbian growl I’m so proud 😭🥺😪
Sorry Tommy I only watched 2 minutes  Prefer the 15-20 minute vids with Ninja and Wilbur
lmao when charlie was like  '' I BORadiNG tHE wINDOWs toO BE sAFE frOM MONstER '''   tommyinnt ; WTF WHY IS HE MINING THE WINDOW WTF'''  jschlatt; '' slef protect '''  gets  stuck with lighting and dies'' tommy and charlie for two mins ; ...ARE NYOU OKIE
Sword art online in a nutshell
the intro music tho
“Am I having a heart attack?”  It’ll be fine, you’ve done it before.
8:58 oh god the fma voice over reference
Rip fuckworld
Do a 100 days survival in this
me hearing Vento d'oro in a tommy vid   HMMMMMm
That house has more personality than Tommyinit
ello
You should do this with Terraria
as a jojo fan i will allow the music
boss is sus 🎴
Me who knows you can just use knockback to get it off it watching this
Guys has anyone noticed he’s used jjba music??? OR WHAT
10 out of 10 should do it again
I swear every one of these videos at least has to have either charlie , wilbur or phil to make these complete
Who here rembers boffy abd tommy collab on rl craft
why are we not talking about Giorno's theme being in Tommy's intros
"survived" is a strong word
If you’re seeing this you’re a French man at heart
Jojo music at the start very good Tommy very good
Now let's convince him to record this again but with Boffy for the nostalgia
How those he have over 100k likes in the first hour
too funny
4:45 "Oooooooooh Its Comin down"!   5 secs later... Charlie is dead
Holler is the name of my pet squirrel
The knowing deficit promisingly guarantee because witness univariably complain past a minor shingle. selective, upbeat den
fly high fuckworld
JOJO THEME SONG YAS >:DDD
12:06 wait isn't that the tower from Philza and Jschlatts old hardcore series-?
Who remembers him playing RlCraft with Boffy?
E
This ain't the hardest mod it's socks for 1s largest mod pack series
We gonna ignore how charlie SPIT THEM FUCKING BARS? AND TOMMY TOO! WTF
RLcraft but this time BoffyYT isnt here
I’m so comfortable in bed, it circled round to making me uncomfortable
Giorno theme
Survived. Right.
is that a jojo theme ??????????????? tommy watches anime ?????????????????????????????????????
At 7:03 Jschatt: Holds da cat          SAMBA
Nice
YOU PLAYED IT AGAIN!!!!!
i -survived- minecraft's hardest mod
"All of my body is broken"  School nurses: uhh, you'll heal. Have some ICE
Everyone: Freaking out about what happened. Schlatt: Scared of god and PRAYING FOR HIS LIFE
charlie is just getting awful memories playing this mod and its fantastic
The video should be on Friday.......
fuck world...
The intro is a jojo reference
I saw fragrance man in this video >:D
POG
6:31 This is just too funny  Jshlatt just slowly looks at the pope, and just prays, and trying to offer sacrifices.
I GUESSED IT
Wait
I can't stop laughing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Whole series please
Wait, a video that don't have the word "hilarious"? The world's is not the same anymore.
In the end it just looks like you doing lore- also that would be a interresing serie i would wacth
The tommyinnit definition of surviving
MY BIRTHDAY IS TODAY
Good job on 9mil tommy!
I love how when Schlatt and his dogs died his death screen said "do you really want to respawn? Think about it"
17:00 oh neat Journey from Destiny 2
Ah! A good 30 minute video of the funniest trio suffering! Love it 😊
did jschlatt really cry after fuck world and the other dog died? (just wanting to know)
It's a little more intense than your regular craft
the holy jambo
Jojo golden wind
In my friend group I'm jschlatt definitely......-
They be spittin bars tho-
This intro is just amazing
Ayyyyyyyyy RL craftttt
2ND EPISODE PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Charlie is terrified Tommy is ambitious Schlatt is conflicted
was it the funniest hardest mod?
golden wind got me feeling like im watching a slmccl video. love it!
25:56 that's what *he* said
Gerno theme at the beginning be banging
I am complete.
RIP FUCKWORLD
jschlatt is here 😻
I like how Timmy says  he is almost to 10 million when he is 900,000 away
Remember when you did this with boffy
I want more
It was official tommyinnit is now a jojo reference
Giornos theme in a nutshell
Shlatt gets stuck by lightning  Charlie: god is affronted by something we said Shlatt: *looks at Pope* Also shlatt: *mutters prayer* Shlatt again: *gives jambo (his cat) to the pope* I must offer a sacrifice
One year ago "I Tried Minecraft's Hardest Mod" and today "I Survived Minecraft's Hardest Mod", how time flies...
moment of silence for fuckworld
Please do more rlcraft videos
fuck world, you will be missed
how is he already at 9 million
May Fuckworld Rest In Peace. :( I'm naming one of my dogs in my survival world Fuckworld in honor of him
Slime has ptsd
Aww I remember the first time I watched one of Tommy’s videos was when he played rlcraft with boffy and I remember being like “man I hope to achieve the level of friendship where we both have the plague and just continue chilin together”
My guy, where’s the video with Skeppys sister at.
The dungeon boss be like:  Dungeon boss:i fear no thing but that thing (fishing rod) it scares me  (The reference for this is a glitch that can kill the dungeon boss in less than 30 seconds using fishing rod
Yeah I like the sound of a part 2
There are so many questionable lines in this video.
fuck world will be forever in our hearts ❤️
Bro I would love to see a series on this
tower name: T69
Actually some of my friends think your unfunny and one said I am the kind of person that would watch your vids
O god not fuckworld
The way the music like booms at the beginning of the video gets me so amped up
Is it bad that i liked the slimecicle rap
Is ThAt MuSiC a JoJo's ReFeReNcE?
RL CRAFT YEAAAA
so we’re gonna just ignore the growl? ok.
17:19 That D2 track really hit different.
Do more
0:27 jojo music     this must be epic
3:09 OwO
Shit I imagine it  took him a year for him to  edit this because it is so hard for little Tommy to win
rip fuckworld, rest in paradise man 😔✌
Ayyy its SOUP FREE SOUP
I love the giornos theme
I just realized Tommy might be a Jojo fan. There is no other reason to put Giorno's theme in the intro
Why does slimecicle always sound like he’s being held at gunpoint while the guy holding the gun is also holding a button that calls an air strike?
2:03 He should've learned his lesson...
COMEE ONNN TOMMMYYY YOU GABAITED ME YESTERDAY NOT POGGERS!!!!! I CHECKED MY PHONE  AS I GOT OUT OF SCHOOL AND NO TOMMYINNIT VID WASSSS THEREEEEEE ok bye gonna lock myself in my room for 30 minutes, hey also tanks for the extra long vid, pogchamp now BYE
Oooo cool mods awooga
Your a day late Tomothyinsideit
I'm disappointed tommy you blurred a curse word how dare you
Don’t have enough skill to eat this bread
Only true gamers remember when he did this with boffy
18:43 was this sync up and for some reason reminds me that one dog that raps
yeh. I hope there are sequels of this I wanna see another fuckworld
Schlatt and the cat are so adorable
Anyone get community rap vibes?
I would love to see a 100 days of this
fly high fuckworld
Now do it in hardcore
Please do a 100 days thing with freinds and such. I think it would be 1000% funny and enjoyable
“His name was fuck world and he is dead” LEGIT LAUGHED FOR 10 MINUTES
23:23 *swedish horse noises intensifies*
anyone else get the reference charlie made at 8:58?
I DIED when charlie said sum- "ITS A CHUBACABRA, THEY'RE REAL!" b*tch that sh*t funny IMFAO
here at five hundred k
can you put the mod link in  the descript so we can download the right one and not a virus
:'( R.I.P fuckworld and THE OTHER ONE we all will remember you both
this video was a blast!
it in tommy (can you see the difference?)
You should make this into an entire survival series
This is multiple mods just in the title i see 3
Rip fuckworld
0:00 XD
Absolutely chaotic...  *and I love it*
So many ads
love how tommys volume is so much louder than evryone elses
slimecicle is the new Lin Manuel Miranda xd
R.I.P Fugkworld and the Other Dog 🪦
slimecicle is like eminem
I thought you said ’today we only have one girl’ BAHAHA WTF
Why destiny music thou
I’ve been waiting for a video ever sense Wilbur betrayed us on tubbos stream.
got the noti 6 second ahoy da fawk
R.I.P Fuckworld 5/22/2021-5/22/2021
Clicked faster then my dad left
Please do more of this
Didn’t Tommy play this with Rudyinnit once?
Tommy your vids make me happy
Fuck his subscriber count is faster than a dragster's acceleration
i was SHOPPING that’s not fair. i clicked faster than i went into the closet. 🥲
Stop Using Slimecicles Way Of His Intros.
Boy hole
Lets goo, another video!
The ooga booga breathing and the beginning lmao
If you did this 100 days style I would actually shit my pants, in a good way of course.
Hexxit not Hardcore
plz do it agen
Charle sounds so traumatized
The intro soung from jojo farms my heart
watching slimecicle having a panic attack because he has ptsd form the last time he played RL craft is too  funny and i don't know why
This guy has come from 0 subs to almost 10 million in 2 years, he's got to be in the top 10 fastest growing youtubers ever!
that destiny 2 song when fuckworld died surprised me
*"HOLES ARE PLUGGED, HOLES ARE PLUGGED!"* - Tommy, 2021
I'm sorry innit but squid stampy and ash did a whole server on it
LMAO JOJO MUSIC IMMEDIATELY NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING
jojo suk
Everyone: Is fine   Schlatt: Sacrificing his cat and screaming
6:40 i love how schlatt just starts repeating the Lord's Prayer
Yea trust me ive played RLCraft😞😞
Rlcraft
LRCR XD
Welcome to the life of RL craft! RL craft is a really fun mod TvT I'm glad you finally played it
schlatt offering his cat is one of the funniest shit ive ever seen
Thata a mother flupn jojo reference ehhhhhhyyyyy
YEEESSSSS
giorno's theme caught me off guard
I clicked on this faster than my pet hamster died
dont mind me just vibin to the golden wind on the start of the video... JOJO GOLDEN WIND
Charlie and Schlatt are the best recurring guests
This was the funniest video i've seen and i've been watching you since 2mil. I died when JSchlatt said : "I am not skilled enough to eat the carrot"
Pleasee part 2
Pleaseee keep Schlatt in your videos
Beat it already completely
CONGRATS ON 9 MILL TOMMY 🤙🏼
Tommyinnt army!!!
Anyone else down to watch a series by this crew on RLCraft
Shliat 2021
This song sounds so familiar OMG its jojo
7:37 never seen schlatt so scared XD
"Survived"
16:34, more halo music
I can’t believe I’ve been subbed from when he was at 567K
Tommyinnt is the best!!!!
Tommy put girono music yooooooooooooo
someone please link me the song in the intro
Hey Tommy. when’s the face reveal?
Why is there 50 ads
Who remembers when he played it with boffy :)?
This friend group always makes me wheeze, and I barely laugh 😳🤚
Hi btw do hardcore
THE LAST FEW MINUTES WERE SO TENSE
Rocraft isn’t the hardest mod pack it just hard to start then it’s pretty smooth sailing after that if you know what your doing
i rly like this new editing style it’s so funny
I now know why tommy hates JSHLATT
Series
this reminds me of Philza and Schlatt's Hexxit series :)
Heyyyy. It’s the funny haha British man
I still don't believe poeple get unsubscribed by youtube i don't care what poeple say
The trumpet skeleton is called sans
Tapl in the bottom left corner
the dogs : almost burns to death because lightening*   schlatt : proceeds to sacrifice jambo to pope*
*COUGH* *MODPACK* *COUGH* *COUGH*
That feeling hen a dog is smarter at putting clothes on than you
I am starting to believe that Steve Harvey and Mr Potato Head are the same person.
Ah
hhvwvbdgvcvhbj
I love the destiny 2 sound track in the background when fuck world died
Hullo Tommy
That Destiny 2 sad theme really hits at FuckWorld 's death o7
Alternative title:jschlatt complains about life and slimecicle finds pets for him while tommy tries to be a tryhard for the first time
good morninggg(this aint my real acc pls understand)
Tommy why don't you make like a normal rl craft series  Think of the women you will attract
Giorno theme at the intro
Now its time for them to kill a dragon
LMFAO 6:16
Oh dude he has so many subs now!
KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK TOMMY
tommy: philza mode activated charlie: *panic* schlatt: focusing on his rap dogs career
15:35 The Song represents how dificult this mod is
this is what he tweeted out when they named the house
Can't we just appreciate how their editors work so hard and took too much time effort on it?  I wish i was that guy one day
Does anyone remember the thing about Tommy getting ten mil before miniminter well it’s gong to happen check out both of the channels
I got some crack — Tommyinnit (4:35)
Slimesicle: pretty sure god was affronted by something we said  Jschlatt: *prays to pope*
The energy of this video is a bit odd. Not bad pursay, just odd. Charlie and Schlatt are already very compatible and familiar with each other but its almost as if Tommy is out of his element withoug Wilbur, Phil and other more familiar people with him.   Am I the only one picking up on this?  (also wow some of the comments on this video are weird)
you know this vid will be good if Giorno’s theme is playing in the intro.
Tommy: "hey fuckworld, give us a beat..."  "I forgot he's a dog"  Iconic
Ep 2
Guess the rapper by the emoji : 👉👌🌍
the audio balence is so akward
POG PLZ DO 100 days
Tommy: "He's thinking about some fucked up shit."  Jachlatt: is kissing Jambo
Almost 10m poggies
Me still vibing to Tommy using il vento d'oro as his intro
💖💖💖
Yo when Tommy was picked up by the roc for the first time he sounded like he was genuinely screaming for his life Jesus. I wanna draw that...
17:17 was not expecting fuckin desinty music
awesome video!
"I survived Minecraft's Funniest mod"
RIP fuckworld 😔
Schlatt: Am I having a heart attack?  *Manberg arc intensifies*
6:16 pls click
I like how the intro was like some of his older videos
the intro was just- ✨beautiful✨  I mean seriously - tommy- please enjoy this video       BEACAUSE WE DID NOT                   then the  giorno's theme song plays
Summary: trust nothing
tommy should do a modded survival series with wilbur, philza, and tubbo
Dude you always get this wrong, it's not a MOD, IT'S A MODPACK, A BUNDLE OF MODS.
Tommy the Dragon is the boss not the ender dragon a dragon those red ones they breathe fire good luck tommy :)
*We stan the jojo music at the beginning*
Fuckworld is love Fuckworld is life
the last part of the video caught me off guard, creepy tommy is not pog
I nearly didn’t click this video. The video said “We Survived Minecraft’s Hardest Mod” Not Funniest Mod
It doesn’t say 1000% funny....
Fuck World will be remembered.
my man used jojo's theme
Am I the only one who started to legit cry when Fuckworld and The other one died
U NUMPTY I WAITED ALL DAY YESTERDAY FOR U TO UPLOAD!!!!! So much for a vid every Friday 🙄
you know what else is hard?
Where is the girl that you wanted to impress 🤔
Awesome vid mate
Your faster than @Slogo
anyone remember when he played this with boffy?
Off topic..        That jojo music slaps
oh
oh im here early lol
See I would say RLcraft is multiple mods and its definitely not the hardest, but Tommyinnit also says 10000% funnier
Hi
U make my day bigman  and greatest fucking intro makes me love your content even more
RIP fuck world
19:28 THE CRAIG PELTON RAP PLS
Little did Tommy know, he summoned a whole fandom with the title music. 😛
when one of the "funniest videos" has slimecicle, you know its gonna be good, when it has schlatt, even better, when no ninja tyler blevins? now its gonna be a real treat
Tommy: starting with giornios theme.  Me: getting flash backs  to the train...
So I see that he took slimecicles opening song lol
Tommyinnit is the best
Hello
It is actually possible to get a dragon in this modpack, if they come back to this and Tommy gets his hands on a dragon then the sky will burn
Your just the best tommy ☺️
ur  wrong
Thanks for making my day better
You must make this a series
NEW VIDEO YEEEEE
No one gonna talk about Jschlatt sacrificing his cat to the Pope?
I thought tommy already played this with Boffy
Jschlatt is traumatized.
Ah yes. The two political sides; the men likers and the women enjoyers
15:46
DUDE YOU GOT OVER 9 MIL
Ahh. Youtubers being tourtured
This video is hilarious
F for Fuckworld
Poor jambo hes been sacrificed to the blood god
The could tame the roc with avian treats and ride it.
That destiny music when fuckworld died hit different
Man still got KSI I’m his vid 😂
Finally posting 😏
When You are to dumb to eat carrot
if you get a fishing rod and rod the boss over and over again u can fling it off the edge and itle die
Anybody else check if they left Destiny 2 on at 18:01?
Guys he is getting to famous to upload weekly on time we are nothing to him 🥺😔
Me: about to sleep Tommy: uploads video
Un pops the popcorn
Honestly, a full series of these guys doing shit like this in rlcraft would fix all my lifes problems.
When he laughs it sounds like he has been smoking cigarettes Lmao
Tommy realised he can’t say funniest so he’s moved onto hardest, next it’ll be weirdest
Anyone remember how boffy and him played RL craft a while back
Wait it reminds me of one really old minecratf youtuber MadziaMagdalenaMonika :>
Poggers
YouTube: We can confirm YouTube does not unsubscribe users from channels, so we'd like to learn more about your experience. so it’s just a gain of wanting subs 💀
THIS IS THE BEST ONE YWT
This is the best video you've ever made, you should make a series of rlcraft
Im not even gonna lie tommys laughs seem forced now
Yeet
fuck world
I'm tommtinnit biggest fan I'm always watching him 🥰
They thought that the battle tower boss was the final boss little did they know about the amaglitch and dragons
Can’t believe I found a new favorite video....miracles do come true-
I miss fuckworld
Pog
RIP fck world and the other one you will be missed by many ♡♡😔✊
F for fuckworld
This is a ptsd experience for Charlie
Hi
why the zombies walk with a limp
Schlatt: am i having a heart attack? *Vietnam flashbacks*
1:10 🐤
try omega adventure pack it's harder
6:33 just turns around to look at the image of the pope
This was so emotional
WHY IS NO ONE ELSE TALKING ABOUT TOMMY'S RAP AT 17:55 i literally laughed at that for like 5 minutes
Only Tommy can ask if someone’s okay if they just got zapped with lightning
If u want a headache u are most welcome😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
i liked the 1st one more
Tommy got bars
2:07 only if he had listened :(
I'm finally earlier than usual. Just and hour late.
Legends do tell of Charlie catching Tommy and then they played for years.
hello i am early i feel special not but hi hello
PogChamp
Me during the intro: WAIT its THE music!!!
Pt2?
PLZ DO A SERI3S OF THIS
Fuckworld
have a good day sir!
Billie: *Duhh* Bentist: *Puhh* Tommy: *PHAAAA*
*am I having a heart attack?!*   *Low blow, man*
Schlatt getting struck by lightning and busting out an Our Father out of pure fear is one of the best things I have ever seen
Honestly this is my fav video
RIP fworld
Nice
The harder he laughs at the thumbnail the newer the video
the DUnGEon BoSs
Schlatt asked the pope for forgiveness
watching schlatt cuddle his cat gives me serotonin am i right or am I right
Golden wing
Wait tf thats the boss from hexxit
Idk why but for me Boss looking sus
Do a seres
Like to pay respect to Fuckworld
Jschlatt's growl fucking killed me
If Tommy ends up doing a series of these, I'll have some problems with mother Medina. It's illegal than the bois can make me wheeze as a fricking window in the middle of the night, while mother is upstairs and praying for me to not become a minecrafter.  I think she is worshiping the wrong man xd
0:15 the bait💀
tommyinnit
plz continue, i thoroughly enjoyed this one!
I love how Slime is basically their guide in this whole ordeal
What is this, an I Survived series... “I survived Minecraft’s Hardest Mod”
Wilbur and Quackity crying over not being there
I subbed before 10 mil
YES YOU NEED TO DO THIS AGAIN
rest in peace fuckworld
Please more :D
Rlcraft and fundy's impossible++ is a fockin nightmare
Is that a *JOJO REFERENCE?*
RLCRAFT..
RIP fckworld
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Wow, he doesnt say he's downright irratating nor annoying anymore it seems. I'm surprised, i really am.
the freestyle was fire tho lol
1 hour ago?!
17:08 D2 music pog
Tommy innit love you
A hat in time music used in this vid
This so funny these are my favourite type of videos
I "Survived" Minecraft's hardest mod
Bruh rlcraft is really hard and unfair I just got killed by an cinder 12 blocks under me that's seems fine
*thinks back to boffy video*
tommy you should do 100 days videos those are intresting to me
rip fuckworld
Pleas make series on this like comment so tommy can see it | | V
Sneeg could've been the philza of this vid
I love your videos 😌 brings happiness and joy to my face
i thought it was mod
RIP F*ckworld 2021-2021
Who know "how to train youre dragon"?
“mans got a shank” wise words
I GOT SO HAPPY WHEN I SAW THAT THIS WAS RLCRAFT
I like how the 2 recent videos both have jojo music, its brillliant
Stop the cap 🧢 (jk)
Tommy really got this one damm he is guna die alot
UPLOAD SOMETHING ELSE PLZ NO MODS
Chommyinnit I am dissapointed you didn't have dragon scale gear
Tommy you should make this a smp series  who agrees?
Part 5 jojo theme if u know u know
I enjoy these, reminds me of og DanTDM mod review
let me guess.. this is minecrafts funniest mod too xD
Clicked faster then my dad went to go get milk
Can. U do anthor epasod but kill the dragon
70k likes in the first 30 minutes!!! YOU HAVE TO DO A PART 2 BRO
love how so many tommy vids have jojo music in and no one realises including tommy
love to see the d2 music
I like yogurt
6:42 this me when i saw anime girl
a jojo reference!!!!
tommy's going to hit 10m before techno.. this is insane
Sneeg SPEEDRUNS Rlcraft. I feel like he would have made a beneficial addition to this video 😅
Giornos theme fit perfectully
PLEASE DO ANOTHER lmao this was so good 😂
Schlatt, Tommy and Charlie dying every 5 seconds  forge labs: *pathetic*
I like how Charlie Slimecicle and Tommy use the exact same JoJo remix for there opening gags for the exact same mod.
“No No No, I’ll come I’ll come, let me get my LONGSWORD.”
Im slightly mad they show a dragon but their goal is just a heavy stone boi that you can kill with a grappling hook.
so we all just here?
Does anyone know the song at 26:55 I really wanna know
Didn't you already do this modpack a year ago lol
Fuckworld : dies   YouTube: GRAMMERLY
The giorno theme makes it better
PART 2????
Tommyinnit has just evolved into slimecicle
i loved this video
Cue the deltarune music
9 million pog
Yoo the epic isaac the binding batle music
Anyone remember when every video he made was about SkyBlock?
So Tommy tell us (if you know and can answer) when will Technoblade finally stop staving us of content?
Love the use of "Journey" from D2 in Fuckworld's funeral. We lost him too early 😔
If tommy can do it then any when can do it
Yay he used giornos theme
Saw ur stream earlier today
7:51 Shlatts face will always be remember as he screams through the fucking pain 😂
Keep doing this as a series,up to killing a dragon
Shlatt looking at the pope was amazing 😂😂😂 6:30
did he get a new editor??? Idk why but the editing looks different
Yay
Imagine they knew that you could kill it with a fishing rod
sick vid but my god 10 adds tho
Hi
Pog
Philza that music was for you
long list of things that make the game unfun as of half way through: Skills (want to use your stuff? you can't until you've used crappy stuff for a long time), traps (hey heres a thing, oh looks like i purposefully made you lose all your stuff also now fuckworld's gone), mobs (oh you're early game?, guess i'll give you some insanely overpowered monsters to die from)
Rip fuck World
tommy im sorry but this is no where near the hardest mod
hi tommy
I seriously think that it would of gotten better with phil :p
Schlatt has enough skill to use a magic tome to summon water from thin air, but he can’t eat bread  Welcome to rlcraft
Keep going tommy! You’re 1Million away from 10million! We’re all here to support you! >:)
this is gonna be interesting
Me: Waiting For tommy to post Him: not Posting Me Now: YESS OMG
POV You are the 1 out of 10k people who disliked Tommy's comment
100 DAYS PLEASE
I like how schlatt starts praying and then try’s to sacrifice his cat to the cardboard cutout behind him
he did not survive.
NOICE
his name was fuckworld and now he's dead i don't have enough skill to eat this bread
Only OG's will remember when Tommy did this video 2 years ago
soon they will think 1.17 will be a little bit more easier than RLCraft when it gets released officially and not be snapshots
Fuckword's death is like Juicewrld's death
*cough* modpack *couch*
The pricey amount electrophysiologically interrupt because snowflake cumulatively watch like a woebegone chill. worthless, itchy quilt
The fact that "holes and plugged" and "thats a nice chest" are next to each other made me spit out my morning water. I am ashamed of myself for laughing at that remark
kanye west would approve of this video, i heard his next album will be co-produced by fuckworld
What A Creepy. 6:50 :[
Tommyinnit at 8.9 million wee almost at 9 million tommy at 9.1 million WHERE ALMOST AT 10 MILLION
Love these videos
rip      F**k world Swim in the lava    2021 - 2021
I know that you wont find this but if you do can you tell me how to make a rlcraft server for free if its not free then can you tell me its not free
That final fight was unironically epic as shit.
Schlatt: *about to drink bottle of water  Zeus: "How about no?"
MMMMMMMMMMM ME GUSTAAAAA
jschlatt holding soup after fuckworld’s death is so tender,,so sorrowful,,,
jschlatt is an idiot 😂😂 he said that a knife is a S tier weapon in the UK
FUCK WORLD
RLCRAFT!11!111!!!!!!
MOOREE
Fuckworld no
I all ways want to know, dose Tommy know Jojo bizarre adventure?
They actually tried! I’m proud
I like it how that he just got crushed by a tree a fucking tree
RIP fuckworld
Is that Charlie Slimecicle?
Hi
POGGGG
Schlatt has become the new wilbur
You know what they say ‘Fuck world’
We need 200 days
Idk if ANY of us could or would trust Tommy with a knife nor when you are eighteen. Tommy you are going to either destroy the world or you are going to claim the world to be your's either one is tremendously scary.
Oh wow Pussyinit has posted another lit video again :P
POOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOG
R.I.P F*ckworld😔 We're gonna miss you
For Fuck World.
Omg, you guys made me laugh, thank you
Everyone: aaaaaaah Shlatt: actually making decent progress
1 hour early
Where do u get the mods from
I could've swore he played this boffy
"Hi beautiful you don't have a face" - Tommyinnit
Love the jojo music
Charlie just sounds like he has ptsd from playing rlcraft before
hi
Someone tell him that you can just fishing rod the tower beast. Then you can just get the loot...
24:40  Tommy: (very quietly) let me down!
loved the video!!! more rl craft soon?
0:12 impostor sus
Lit
Golden wind theme start play?
when tommy said "we should name our house" my immediate thought was "schlatt don't you dare say "big house"' and you know what he f*cking did?
The drip dog

Ayee Hi big man T! How are you? Also good job on 9 Million!
Anyone remember when Boffy did this with Tommy and tommy wasn’t as popular as he was now  Here was a link to Boffys vid with him for anyone who is curious: https://youtu.be/_eh2J85YbbY  And then here was Tommy’s one with him: https://youtu.be/YUcyNESJfrY
next goal. kill the dragon
1:26 Jschlatt: What am i having a heart attack!?  Me: *Schlatt dying from heart attack on the SMP flashbacks*
watched the hole thing 30 mins
Me seeing the title: I doubt he will survive Me after watching the video: *psychic 100*
im guessing tommy is starting to like jjba
eeeeee
The fist this I thought was is Charlie waring a shirt
The title shouldve been..... I survived minecrafts hardest mode for 000000000.1 milliseconds
Make a series pls!
Not to flex but I can tell when the next video comes out      Next video answer: this year
Ah yes no music
Didnt he do this mod with boffy also?
A moment of silence for people who lost thier pets and loved ones
Sheesh
Knowing how to actually play the game and watching this hurts my soul.
9 million what? apples? bananas?

Shlatt hugging Jambo gives me life
Big fan in ph😊

Jesus christ theres like 20 billion midroll ads
I came here straight from SAD-ist's newest video and lemme tell you, that was quite the mood swing
One day I will be the biggest artist in the music industry...manifest 💯🐐🎶👀
OKAY I WANNA 100 DAYS VIDEOS SO HERE'S A COMMENT TO HELP OUT

It's a really gut wrenching feeling to see jschlatt. I feel so guilt watching anything with him in it at this point
please man its a modpack call it a modpack or im going to start having convulsions again
I love the videos with Slimecicle, you should invite that Slmccl guy sometime
Tommy: this is minecraft's hardest mod  Me: you ever heard of blood and bones?
Not the Pope-

2:02 slime straight up predicted fuckworlds death
Tommy should do more videos with boffy because this is reminding of the first RLCRAFT video he made with boffy about a year ago
I remember watching this guy at 30,000 subs...  9 MILLION HOLY SH-
Hello
Congrats on 9mil Tommy. 😊

Omg
Im never been so early on a Tommyinit video-  Did i regret staying up on night?  *N O*
I think Tommy became a JoJo fan
Hello
To be honest Tommy innit is becoming a cashish grab look at the ads and he makes the same types of videos because they are easy to make
Alternative title: Underage child and grown men survive in artificial cube world with random creatures
10:59
I find it funny they never had to try and drink water because they never survived long enough
RLCraft isn't a mod, it's a modpack, and it's shit. (if you want to play a good hard modpack, play Rebirth of the Night (for PvE) or Omnifactory (for tech)) Calling it a mod in particular though, is kind of rude to the hundreds of developers who worked on the actual mods, to attribute all of their content to some guy who threw them all together into a downloadable
Giorno’s theme: exists  Weebs: HoLy ShIT POpUlaR YOuteBeR iS OnE OF uS
JOJO reference
1:50 Jesus Christ*
rip fuckworld 😔

Schlatt: Am I having a heartattack?  *Oh no not again*
the herobrine thing actually scared me
Tommyinnit be like  We only have One Goal And it is to Defeat the boss AND Survive
The gang in a nutshell: Wilbur: *Constantly finds a way to start a cult* Jshlatt: *Corrupt and greedy businessman* Slimsicle: *Autistic* Tommy: *Constantly laughing* Philza: *Everyone's father figure* Tubbo: *Mentally disabled*
Tommyinnit is a Jojo fan 🤔
Noice
17:55 lol
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago He left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
P
The censored curses in the beginning threw me off
As rolls every 3-5 minutes. Lmao.
I REMEMBER WHEN YOU PLAYED THIS MOD WITH BOFFY OMG

The dungeon boss is honestly a minor threat compared to other enemies. In fact you can sometimes avoid him and take the chest loot of the tower's top with no hassle...
No one: Not A Single Soul: My reaction to every Tommy video: *oh.*

Tommay a day late my FRIEND!!!!!!!
This first time I'm actually early for tommys video rjdjdjhe
Tommy: I got some crack- KRAKE MEAT
I 'Survived' Minecraft's Hardest Mod..
Boss: fishing rod is my only weakness!
19:25 Ngl Tommy’s raps we’re not that bad
I loved this one especially, with Slimecicle and jschlatt It's that grind and then the satisfaction to kill the end boss of a tower that just makes my day.
Where in bloody hell is the betterend video tomathy insideofit?
Giornos theme
he really said "mans got a SHANK" -Tommyinnit
YES THE JOJOS MSUIC

Elodie did a good job and tommy too i guess
*Why does the boss looks like*   *Amog us*
Damn this was 46 minutes ago and yet this has 84k likes, impressive 😲
It would be sooo much easier is they knew the fishing rod exploit where you fishing rod the dundgon boss and hit it once and it fly's off at 10000 miles an hour
your laughing? two dogs fell in a lava trap and your laughing? (17:02), i mean i did laugh too so yea
what the F*ck is that -this entire video

*"hey there beautifu- **_you don't have a face"_* relatable
Thanks it is my bday and got a Tommy video, thanks Tommy
Try to get dream to play the gamemode

THAT INTRO WAS *J A M M I N G*
HEYYY TOMMY
Please make this a series
Les goo
part 2?
Tommy quote “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!”
Ice And fire is a good mod
Tommy is probably going insane
Mongoose 😳
This is Boffys rlcraft on fucking steroids, and Boffy's already on steroids.
"His name was fckworld now he is dead" "I don't have enough skill to eat this bread"  Sadness & beats intensifies
Oh well
Idiotic Psychopaths+ the RLcraft modpack= The funniest and most chaotic thing ever
This vid reminds me of the old TommyInnit when him and boffy did a let’s play with this mod
Wow tommer innit thank you for the incredible video from YOUTUBE website by SUSAN
The zombies have a better posture than Tommy.

Tommyinnit: *uploads on Saturday* Me: is today Friday?
Yes! Rlcraft! Finally!
this was deadass a movie wtf. like my tommyinnit video turned into fucking maze runner
The funny thing is he has played this mod before with boffy and also another fun fact when I first joined the dsmp fandom I genuinely though jschlatt irl died
All they needed was the fishing rod
This becoming a series would be amazing
tommy i remember the days where u were rising as a young youtuber at 100k subs lol
It’s so hard that tommy played jojo music
I like how the intro has JoJo music just next time sickles video did about this amazing reference
Dino
1:25  *Vietnam flashbacks*
Tommy: I don't like anime "uses JoJo music as intro music"
New video ᕙ(＠°▽°＠)ᕗ
If schlatt hit respawn the dogs would have tp'ed  back to him
mor sufering pls
Tommy blurrs out some cursing now? XDDD
I laughed my arse off i cried so much of how funny it is
YES HE DID IT!!!
Me the 1st 40 secs: bop'n away Me after the 1st 40 secs: this is epic and I like this
'alt-f4 may solve all of your problems'
18:00 damn man those are some bars right there
What r u looking at people, subscribe or you"ll be haunted by fuckworld, and those were some nice beats down there...😂
Charlie’s just acting like a terrified zoologist
11:12, that’s what she said.
Slimecicle: Talks about god  God in jschlatts perspective: Allow me to introduce myself Jschlatt: I shall do a sacrifice  Him: Brings cat
Day 1 of asking tommy to make a hypixel skyblock video.
this is the first mod without wilbur :(
I laughed so hard when shlatt looked behind him and just started praying
Just appreciate the giornos theme at the start of the video
This was amazing Tommy, could you please play a funny mod like the language changes every 5 minutes with Charlie, Wilbur, tubbo and Phil 😁 that would be amazing
Strange but hilarious.
I wanna see a smp in rlcraft

Love how Slimecicle is teaching Tommy even though he used to play RLCraft with Boffy
Tommy is a jojo reference
That moment when you know how to play RLCraft and you know what they are doing wrong will just internally hurt you as a gamer
I loved this video I'm sure you did too :) 😋
When you are too old that you remember that the tower explodes
Shlatt makes this 1000% funnier
f*ck world was a true idol of his time. 2021-2021
Cool!
18:14 that was the most adorable thing I have ever seen 🥺🐈
tommy: *plays RLCraft and being his usual funny self* slimecicle: **WAR FLASHBACKS**

This should be a 3 parter
Are we just gonna ignore how he used jojo 😳
Search up slimecicle into and guess what song it is.
7:02 Soup is really confused XD
That's got to be the best pirate I've ever seen.
“He’s thinking of some fucked up shit” Schlatt: *is kissing cat*
I love this mod but at the same time hate it
rlcraft moment
Charlie getting ptsd of the skeletons again
What happened to Boffy?? 😭😭
"His name was Fuckworld, now he is dead. I don't have enough skill to eat this bread" 😂
yes RL craft is hard, but ice and fire it self is very easy. its not A mod its a modpack just saying
Yup Slimecicle definitively had an influence on Tommy with giorno’s theme
GOOD JOB FOR 9 MIL TOMMY!
Congrats on 9 million Tommy
He got dogs ! :D
bro just get a fishing rod
Anyone gonna mention the fact that Schlatt took the horn from Tommy to go and _have some fun_ ? No? Okay.
Love the vid
Keep playing the Giorno Theme music in your intros

KInda wacky ngl
14:39 I don’t like that the monster inflicted Tommy with “Penetration II”
this gives me the shivers, when he did this with boffy a more then a freaking year ago
Please do this again I play rlcraft WAY too much and I've beaten in in hardcore

Hey Tommy just wondering if you have watched “JOJO’s bizarre adventure”
Hey Tommy are you a jojo fan?
Please do another episode with Sneegsnag
Tommy u should have had boffy hes funny too
WAS THAT A JOJO REEFERENCE!?!??!?!?!?
I just realized that Tommy played Golden Wind at the start of the video....  Cant imagine this being copywrite...   N o t  A t  A l l
I loved the bars tommy and charlie dropped the should make a song out of it 🤣🤣
yes make it a serie pleaaase
do a lets play
bruh didn't you already play this with boffy
you all should go to 5:46 its very intellegant
IM EARLY FOR ONCE
love how it starts off censoring swears and then just gives up halfway through 😂
Tommy :  where inspired by Kanye West  Dog: wtf
I've always wanted to see you play this mod, have fun tommy  👍
When you realise this is the only video tommy didnt get demonitised
Tommyinnit jojo reference?
Im the only one who notis he was playing jojo musich
I want an entire letsplay, this was amazing.
Sounds good
Just started the video, "survived" is a stretch.
Rl craft is ez clap
**boffy flashbacks**
I saw the title and instantly thought of : *RL CRAFT😩*
pog
3:50 SHLATT- S H L A T T
This should be a complete play trough
I didn't recognize the destiny music at 18:05...UNTIL I DID
40 minutes and 450k views
hang on swear ive seen this video before
I'm already subbed
“Hey there beautifu- you don’t have a face”
Lol
the memes in this are perfecto
Bruh the tower boss is nothing compared to the last boss but that was entertaining😄😄
Jojo reference?
CHAOS
If life was i mod it would be harder
RL Craft is the best mod hands down. Super hype you guys tried it.
This should become a series plus, it would make a excuse to make fan art.
Why does it say posted 10 minutes ago? I just finished the 30 min video, and it says posted 10 min ago. Like-   Great video tommy!
Jschlat: “I’m stuck in the wall” Tommy: “ Where are you?”
I played this smart I think it’s called rl craft and I’m excited for 10M
I remember him and Boffy playing
Early gang
Did you know that if you tower up to the golem he stays still then YEET himself if you have a fishing rod
FINALLY TOMMY POSTED
o7 to fuckworld
Rip fuckworld 2021-2021
This would be a great series
So sad fuck world died but at least his resting song was from destiny 2
The giorno theme at the start of videos do be *bussin*
Frist
Fuck world forever!!!!
tommy really hit us with deans payday rap from community damn 19:25
SO WE'RE NOT GOING TALK ABOUT THE RAP TOMMYINIT RAP IS SICK MAN
Pl: Co jest kurde noc jest kurde 23 jest  Its 11 PM im my country
Didn’t Tommy play this with boffy
This video VERY AMAZING!
THERE HE IS I thought he wasn't gonna post this week
Let's be honest....we were all disappointed that this wasn't the technoblade video.
I clicked faster than my Internet connection
Why was i just binge watching loads of tommys funniest videos and thought, imagine if they did RLCRAFT that would be mental... 😂🤣
"Please enjoy this video, BECAUSE WE. DID. NOT."
Bro that intro music was bussin’
i will never not be jealous of tommy’s blue eyes
I don't wanna be that person but if you fish the guardian with fishing rod from side a bit above him couple times and hit him he will yeet across time and space and you can steal the Chest. But its fun to watch people do it intentional way
I noticed that the Destiny 2 soundtrack 11 was playing when fuckworld died
Happy 9 mill subs
I love how at the start of the video Tommy blurred the swears but after a few minutes he just stopped
Let's gooooo rlcraft
Imagine not having 10mil smh
I see that you have used the seed 69... how ironic
I genuinely laughed so hard at this video.
Plz do a series on rlcraft
Clicked faster than Adrien could say "She's just a friend"
28:50 *F.*
Let’s go 9 Million Youvare the best Tommy
Can we just talk about the fact Tommy's carrying
Everyone is getting excited about dreams songs but what we really need is a TommyInnit 10mil special that’s just a rap song by him Charlie and Schlatt
If you want to play RLCraft again, you need to learn a lot of tricks to be better at it :D But it was one of funniest videos I watched in a while XD
EARLY T0MMY ANNI [LACSE NOTICE ME IT WIIOULDNT MEAN THE WORLD TYO ME UWU BAKA IMPOSTOR SENPAI HSKJSAHJDHJKASHDKAHDKAJHD 😫
Tell me Tell me a you're worst sicko mode bro you're awesome
I enjoyed it yess
Why the JoJo music
OKAY BUT CAN WE PLEASE JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO APPRECIATE THE W O N D E R F U L EDITING, THANKS
I love the hat in time music
Who's early?
Schlatt want even scared lol. He just killed the monster no matter what it looked like.
When you hear that jojo music play u know it’s funny
AWSOME
1:26 *has flashbacks*
Years of horror game experience could never prepare anyone for the nightmare that is rlcraft.     *the realistic torches*
Tommy u make us entertained
F*ck the WORLD
Jschlatt did not listen to Charlie at 2:07       Rip Fuckworld
Sadist part is that Jschlatt could have saved his dogs if he spawned in.
Tommy: Lovers of women Schlatt: *Breaks sign* Schlatt: "I don't agree with that one" Me: "Is Gay?"
2:07 “Never make that assumption or you will be instantly killed” Lol the foreshadowing
Poor fuckworld [*]
Hardest mod, great but is it 1000% funny?
Tommyinnit won’t respond prove me wrong
Tommyinnit: worlds hardest mod RLCraft: is a modpack
Omg comment 11k im so fast
WE NEED MORE VIDEOS WITH THIS TRIO
JCAT
Yayyy new mod video
fuckworld
I loved  this video
Only tommy would say his CLOSE to 10 mil when he needs a WHOLE MIL       *But yeah tommy is great he deserves it*
Jschlatt- falls into the trap Tommys- like WhAt happened Fuckworld- falls into the trap then he dies Jschlatt- is like NoOoOo Tommys like wHaT happened  Jschlatt- is like fuckworld died- Tommy is like NOOOOOOOOO FUCK WORLD Then the other fuck world falls into the trap Jschlatt- is like NOOOOOOOOOOO
I think you a better YouTuber than dream
This brings back so many memories from when Tommy first played RLCraft with Boffy he was barely 1 mil I think
“I got hit in the left arm,            “*Do I have a heart attack?*” -Jschlatt
I bet you will get 10 mil before miniminter😂
tommy congrats on 9 mill i just started watching your videos again 1 month ago they are so good and you are getting so good at this keep it up man!
who else actually got ptsd when they saw herobrine at 20:27
You love to see it
yes
I’m surprised that you can get a knife
Is it just me that realizes that when he makes a video everytime he gets at the least a quarter to half a million subscribers?
Jambo is cute  (schlatts cat)
Each like of this comment is a rip to fuck world
S A C R I F I C E
100 days rlcraft sounds halarious
Tell my tommy do u play cup because u were playing the music in the background
Tommy you is the best
this is complete chaos
It isn’t, the one finds made is the hardest, at least get your facts right man.
Idk what to comment
There's a video in your ads
4:35 Oh i got some Crack! -tommyinnit
Make this a series
TOMMY MY BIG MAN !
This was the funniest video on this channel
"WE NEED TO GO TO THE TOWER SO WE CAN HEAR HOLLER!" - Tommyinnit 2021
You should try to beat the naga with the twilight forest mod
Rip fuckworld
HOPE U NOTICE ME
“He’s thinking about some fucked up shit”  Schlatt: *kisses cat*
We love the vids
“I watched you piss on me”  Had me rollin  the whole vid was jokes
Slimecicle is that one token gem in a group  Jschlatt: the dog can’t speak English  Slimecicle: He’s actually completely fluent in Spanish  its moments like this that make me love his personality
R.I.P. Fuck World
Do it, just do it, u sed tomorrow but u didn't do it tomorrow, JUST DO IT, Do it.
I like how their goal was one of the weak bosses
Tommy have you been watching JoJo or is it just the music is pog
fuckworld is going to be remembered   and the other one too
Roses are dead “Violets are dying" “Outside i’m smiling" “But inside i’m crying ....  "I just wish people would notice my content and give me a chance to prove myself".
It was awesome please respond 2 my commet
Hexxit
Tommy really put Destiny 2 music in his video lmao
Just a fun fact when the dog fuckworld dies the music playing is from the Destiny 2 campaign  *SPOLIERS*           its when they walk in the mountain after they lost the city when the music plays
oh forge labs  did this mod too :D
It must've made the video 100000% funnier
Wel TOMMyINNT!!!!!
POGGGGG VIDEO
Ayyyyyyyy
The georno theme makes sense for this video
Shlatt praying was the funniest part😂😂😂
Jschlatt praying to god and sacrificing
Dungeon boss looks kinda sus
Please do another part of this
This is a big Jojo refference
11,882
If he like's my comment or commint on this comment ill say to my baby sister i hate her screaming :()
THE JOJO MUSIC
I like that the song in the intro is the same song as slimecicle’s video on it
Fuckworld: dies **intense destiny 2 sad music playing** (or that's what I think it is)
"I'm having a heart attack?"  Man...smp aged well
in rlcraft you are never safe, unless God or luck is on your side even then, the mod is absolutely not for beginers
Holy banana im so early
I do love rl craft
11872nd
Tommy watches jojo?
I wish carson was in the vids, maybe one day
its hardest modpack, not a mod
29:55 😀
I watch the other RLCRAFT video xd
Congratulations for 9M Tommy!!!
When you hear Giorno’s theme
Almost 10 million? That encourages me to upload. Actually no
Hello
We realize the reason they suffered was because Tommy brought them to the tower right...?
Still confused why the child doesn't have a girlfriend yet-
What's the mod called tho
jojo music 😳 tommy is weeb confirmed
well since I have this chance, HEY TOMMYINNIT!  I’ve wanted to draw you fanart for a while but I want YOU to choose what I draw :D You can request ANYTHING, let your imagination run wild! I’ve been doing a lot of art studies recently, so I can draw anything with my best effort! You can be as simple as you like, or even be super detailed with your request! If you have any ideas, you can reply here and I’ll be honored to draw you whatever you’d like!  I freakin love your content, dude! You’ve got the most awesome energy ever! Thanks for making my days just a little bit brighter!
i love u
f in the chat to Fuckworld  oh, and the other one i guess..
Hi
FUCK WORLD
the jojo music is a hit
Damn the destiny soundtrack when fuckworld died pog

Tommy remember when you did this with boffy I enjoyed that so much
I'm not sure why I laughed at the fact Schlatt's wolves died... But I couldn't stop...

4:38
I FUCKIN KNEW YOU WERE GONNA PLAY RLCRAFT I FELT IT IN MY BONES
I love tommy and this new style of editing, it’s very entertaining and I get he kinda ways to expand his audience (this is an assumption idk if this is the actual reason) but I kinda liked the swearing more it kinda made it more funny. No hate towards tommy, the person who edited the video, or anyone who doesn’t like swearing. This is just an opinion.
Slimecicle is a freaking veteran at rl craft lol, he's experienced the fear it brings
these guys made more progress than me in 30 minutes
People who used the grappling hook for 5 minutes looking at this challenge and asking "Is this a joke?"
thats probably way you didn't upload for a week anyway congrats on nine mil!
I can see the animatics and fan art of fuckworld from here....
I feel like I'm watching the make a wish kid
Almost 10 million. Letssss goooo poggers

The same intro song from Charlie's experience
11k comments already????

Jschlatt: Am I having a heart attack?  The fandom: *intense flashbacks*
WHY CAN JSHLATT DO A BETTER LESBIAN GROWL THAN ME WHOS A LESBIAN-
100 days please
We got a 30 minute video what a treat
"His name is f*** world now he is dead  I dont have enough skill to eat this bread"
"Let me know if you guys enjoyed this video!"  Tommy, YouTubers suffering is the meta for views man.
i swear to god Jshlatt is a whole mood
PART 2 PART 2 part 2 part 2 pls tommy
is this a new editor?  either way, this was great
Pog
When Schlatt fell into the lava and his dogs came in after he could've just respawned and the dogs would've teleported
Ayy
*Shlatt gets struck by lightning* Charlie: "god was affronted" Shlatt: *prays*
Do it again
Charlie: Lux Jengu can't hurt you, he's a star wars character Jschlatt: *he can indeed hurt*
May Fuckworld rest in peace            2021-2021 You will forever be missed

Jojo song tommy
Editor can you turn down Tommy a bit, he’s so much louder than Schlatt and slime, thank you.
Rlcraft ≠ hard Rlcraft = bullshit
When Tommy is like “he’s thinking about fucked up shit now” and jschatt is just kissing his fucking cat lmfao man
Finally rl craft
6:25 lmao
Is this a jojo reference
“The pressure plate is for the door you fuck8ng dumbass” Slmccl: never make that assumption Jschlatt: *falls in a pit due to pressure plates. Which makes his dogs fall in too.  Always listen to slmccl advice.
I always get excited when i find a tommy mod vid that i have not seen then i realize its new
Eminem❌  FUCKWORLD✅
As Fuck World once said "...Woof..."

This time he didn't use the word funny or hilarious
Lol i love this and your videos tommy!
veiwer 406,150
Hi
stfu Scythe
Before the 10mill club
you know it's funny when he has a remixed version of giorno's theme
The jojo music in the background is good .
Me: Calmly watching the EuroVision Tommy: NOPE
i love staying up from 4:30 am to 5:10 am to watch a tommyinnit video. time to sleeo now. good night
HEWWO TOMOTHY
New editor hard at work I see
Y'all remember when he did this with Boffy
but did you?
Yay RLCRAFT
WHAT WAS THE BACKGROUND MUSIC CALLED??????????? In the beginnings
I love that almost every intro has the JoJo theme😂
Can you make this a series? I've been waiting for someone to play RLcraft in a funny way
Chat: The tower will explode without its king! Tommy: schlatt you lied, it didn’t explode.  this is what I call a big brain move
:]
Giornos theme lets goo
when you didn't post yesterday i thaught i got unsubscribed at first.
When I saw his goal... *lol ez. Use the fishing rod tactic.*. Them: *AHHHHH (death)*
Jeez nearly 10 mil
Boo
"the slicer" is just an off-brand "the blade" tbh  the blade's predecessor maybe...?
Dog r.i.p. his die  :[ :( 😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
THIS IS 1000 PERCENT FUNNY
tommy you scammed us this is saturday >:(
They should make a dream smp but with rl craft mods
AMAZINGGGG
I see no top comments about the JoJo music so imma just do that
No sé lo que sea, tal vez es el mod, no sé, pero el mundo y algunas cosas me recuerdan mucho a Karmaland, especialmente lo de la niña riendo (?)
I remember the OG Tommy RLCraft video
Jesus loves you.Turn to him before it’s too late
EARLY
Rip fuckworld will miss you 😭
get him to 10 mil
The jojo music
At 16 mins is that the sad music from the destiny 2 intro?? Love it
Pov: You are tommy  The HARDEST mod ever  The must funnier video EVER  ( He use the some tittle all times lol)
CONGRATS ON 9 MILLON. 10m coming soon
Why the boss is amogus?!?
Near the beginning, when Schlatt mocks Tommy for being scared of the pressure plate, charlie warns schlatt to “never make that assumption again or you will be instantly killed”. Schlatt later loses fuckworld and the other one due to a pressure plate. Karma in action.
THIS WAS SO COOL AND LOOKED STRESSFUL
Woah a vid with under 100k likes so far
NOOOOO FUCKWORLDDDD
Yay Tommy good vid
Is that a jojo reference
Here early
Fundy=my day is ruined and my disappointment is immeasurable

“He’s thinking about some fucked up shit” *schlatt petting his cat*
God the jojo music is soooo gooood
“Please enjoy this video because WE DID NOT”  * “EPIC MUSIC that is there to thank YOU dear viewer, for subscribing and getting the channel to 9 Million subscribers” plays *
I love that they gave up trying to censor the curses like 2 minutes into the video
RIP Fuckworld
hopefully minnyminter gets to 10mil first
Tommy pls think about bringing merchandise on the market! It would be really epic!!
Congrats on 9 million,I wish you best of luck with 10 mil
When will u upload the dream smp?
Please tell me you streamed this

First 500 k
Jschlatt Praying is what i needed
anyone remember when tommy played rlcraft with boffy?
THAT INTRO WAS STRAIGHT FUCKIN FIRE
7:36 is the funniest thing i have ever seen
i kept thinking because schlatt's wearing leather boots and pants that he just didn't have any on because leather is the same colour as his skin
F world
Who remembers when Tommy and Boffy played this?
wow
This makes me miss Reddit
If they had a fishing rod this config would’ve been won in 1 and a half hours
Rest In Peace fuck world 2021-2021
The amount of ads go BRRRR
Fuckworld dying is the saddest moment in cinematic history
POV: When you randomly hear Ribby and Croaks music *Flashback*
0:12 AMOGUS

Jschlatt shouting “TOMMY!!!” was something I did not expect to hear

69k likes.
Thanks to the notification bell! That was a nice video!

Poggers

Pls play this more i like it
Clearly, you haven't seen fundy's mods then
Let’s get 10 mill before next month
GET BIG MAN TOMMY TO 10 MIL
Why was Charlie's rapping lowkey good
Can't Wait For Part 2 (That is going to be a thing right? lol im sure it was fun enough to do again!) and maybe you might find a dragon they are pretty nice creatures >:)
the comments are looking like mann vs machine
Near the beginning, when Schlatt mocks Tommy for being scared of the pressure plate, charlie warns schlatt to “never make that assumption again or you will be instantly killed”. It’s to f*cking perfect
it's harcore hexxit all over again
That name mod is "RLcraft" I think
I have been waiting for this for years bro
im so happy to see schlatt in more of these he's so funny
as im commenting this there are 69k likes remember the date
ive never been this early to a vid
RIP fuckworld. You will forever live in our hearts.
Wha- wha- whe- I- *instense inhale* where I wilbur
What health bar mod are you using??
I wanna see them play pixelmon. I think it would be very fun
RIP fuckworld may 22 2021- May 22 2021
Charlie dies* Tommy: we did it we won
Tommy likes jojo confirmed 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
When they rapped in remembrance of fuck world tommy actually kinda popped off like ngl 😂
“If we keep throwing ourselves at them, eventually it will have to work” Average RLcraft player
Ah yes  Fuckworld and the other one
R.I.p fuckWorld
HE DESERVED THIS lol he didnt but CONGRATS ON 9 MIL
Tommy my mum said your shit
A TommyInnit video without the word funny in it.....     Impossible
Near the beginning, when Schlatt mocks Tommy for being scared of the pressure plate, charlie warns schlatt to “never make that assumption again or you will be instantly killed”. Interesting how karma works...
SOUP
i was waiting for schlatt to mention 'trump tower' and then i realised that was the wrong series
I loooooooooove this video so funny and entertaining :D Tommy’s probably the only one I can watch for hours without getting bored <3
Can we PLEASE make this a series
I wish I had youtude premium for this one
0:11 Tommy: We Have Only One Goal,To Defeat The Dungeon Boss Calvin : Defeating it with a rod and bow
Rlcraft isnt a mod. Its a modpack.
Hahahaha i loved the videoo rezt in peace fvkworld
Tommy, why do I here JoJo music? Also, play the Orespawn Mod with PopularMMOs
This was 100% worth the wait :)
Tommyinnit physically cannot be unentertaining, I think tommy has more main character energy than ranboo
Who else think Tommy was spitting bars
Anyone remember the Hexxit Hardcore Series with the towers, if you know you know ✨ **Vietnam war flashbacks intensifies** ✨
You could say he "f*cked up in that world"
66k views in 2 mins, wow
Don’t like it Tommy’s favourite number of likes
Make it a series Tommy
I survived one of tommyinits videos
Tommy is becoming more and more like charlie every day. He even uses the same type of intro now
and ya didn’t even meet a dragon
you can hear the trauma in slime’s voice while explaining rlcraft to schlatt and tommy
Early! ( when u r early and dont know what to say....)
Cool, but.... *it’s not Friday tho*
I WANTED CHARLIE TO PLAY RLCRAFT AGAIN SO MUCH THIS IS AMAZING

Loud = Funny is what Tommy's audience thinks
The video was really funny it made my day❤️😊(-:<3^_^
personally tommy, i enjoyed this content a bit less than your usual kind, it was a bit slow-paced for me and idk it was less 'hilariously funny'. That said, I still loved it a lot, and I'll watch anything that makes you happy, but this is just my opinion.
Let's go
Been here since 3 mil...     *NO REGRETS*
100 days? That sounds awesome!

All schlat had to do to save the dog was to press respawn and they would've tp'd back to him
Rip Fuck World and The Other One
Is no one gOnNa talk about the jojo music
HOLY SHIT-
Jojo music is always in back, is tommy a fan?

Hi Tommy, I love it vids!

His name is fuckworld and he’s dead I don’t have enough skill to eat this bread
POV Tommy uploads a video
DID SCHLATT JUST GROWL LMFAO
RIP Fuckworld  2021-2021
Hello Tommy, have you had your daily fork today?
*leaves at the "god was a fronted part"*  *returns at the "RIP Fuck World" part*  the fuck happened-
probably one of the coolest videos you’ve made. i rlly like the vibe with charlie and schlatt because i think we see too much of wilbur and philza
I love how Charlie is very obviously traumatized from the last time he played this modpack
Charlie, Shlatt and Tommy make a Iconic trio
Moral of this episode: don’t underestimate pressure plates
early
This video is SICK and POGGERS and might I even say *Swag*
Here come all the “first” comments
My rating for jschlatt monkey impression is 8.5/10 (25:19)
28 minutes and already 10 000 comments wow
Yes 9m yyyyeeeessss
The pope has more have the most kills in this vid if u think abt it
Rip fuckworld 💔
Do this again please or another mod like this please I loved this so much and you three made it hilarious to me
what do you use to make the servers?
Timothy innit has risen!!!!!
wow
you should do a terraria video!!
The more and more I see people that play this mod, the more exciting it is.  Happy 9 mil Tommy!
WHY DOES SCHLATT HAVE A CUTOUT IF THE POPE
Tommy got a new editor?
Schlatt: "Am I having a heart attack?"  Dream SMP somehow involving itself in a Tommyinnit video: "Yes, yes you are." :)
Tommy: puts JoJo music JoJo fans: everyone like that
Charlie trying to explain Tommy: “ I’ve got a shank”
ice and fire pog
Remember the series with boffy lol 😂
giorno
Ok the person who Edited this and the prison video NEEDS a raise like😩
“RIP fuckworld (and the other one)” lmfao
Plot twist: Schlatt is Herobrine in disguise
Love the video dude! 🙏
ALL HAIL TOMMYINNIT!! THE LORD HAS POSTED
Too many  ads bro
“The dog’s fluent in spanish” Heh, I get that reference
I remember when he played with boffy
Charlie: *amaizing rap* Jshlat: We are going to die
"i got some crack"
I have no idea what is happening with the  verified comments, like, did a bunch of people get hacked?
Love the cup head music lol
New editor?
Death is 1000% sad...
Last
Yeet
Anyone else just here for schlatt
The best thing in this vid was that every time Jschlatt tried to use a weapon he couldn’t use it because he wasn’t clever enough to use it🤣😂
The only thing I took put of this video: Men likers And women enjoyers
Anyone hear the Cuphead music throughout the video?
The intro: *exi-* JOJO DUDUDUDUUUUUUDUDUD GOLD WINDDD
341,975 views IN 28 MINUTES
I can't how fuckworld got a grave and the other one got only a one  block bahahah
Slime still has trauma
Tommy when your doing the dungeon tower get piston arrows and shoot him of
I'll be honset, seeing Schlatt turn to the Pope and start praying to god was the funniest shit I've seen as a catholic
Tommy using JOJO music pog
RIP fuckworld
can i get heart
Early I guess
If anyone is wondering what the "sad music" is called that played when Schlatt's wolves died, it's Journey from Destiny 2.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYfe9caNqfA&ab_channel=BungieBungie
YES MY RL PHASE CAN FINALLY COME BACK
When you hear Tommy’s video opens with Gironoes theme *you know it’s gonna be good*
RL Craft :O
Play this with sneeg
Charlie must have felt so much trauma during this entire video.
i have been thinking of this for like 10 minutes now. Couldn’t they just put blocks and start climbing up😀?
e
didnt tommy already do a rlcraft video with boffy and now hes acting like hes never played rlcraft
Someone forgot to upload on Friday so they uploaded on Saturday
Everybody sub to tommy so he will g ett 10million
Community: How fast do u want to grow? Tommy: Yep
I was suprised he didn't put minecrafts hardest mod is so funny! This child is maturing :o
In this situation Charlie is like the Ph1lzA of the video
17:16 why did he sound like a chicken
I thought there were going to be a lot of “hard” jokes
I was hoping to see boffy in this, other than that YOOOOOO
This week’s best day is Saturday I guess
early lol
thats really the hardest modpack. i actually was hopping u do a video about rlcraft
Waiting for Tommy to make a series AND ride a dragon
When you’re so early half the comments are bots
the song for fuckwold's funeral is called journey
Tommy why did you censor words😭
Heyyy

People who never hated tommy  👉👉
Evrovision
Jschlatt funny

This video was an emotional rollercoaster
Absolutely pro
6:51 why does he have a png of the pope
I someone to build a castle on my world for Xbox  Anyone???? All survival
336,179th
The fact that I fought Tommy was at a million only yesterday proves how much time has passed.... (Side note) HES 17 NOW ASWELL!!
I am actually getting angry at how Tommy never credits the mod, or even call this a modpack instead of a mod
HE ACTUALLY PLAYED THE MOD I WAS WAITING FOR THIS
Do more dream SMP
Oh I've played RLcraft before. I can tell before even watching that it is hard as frick
Greetings
Man, I just watched your old vid with same intro like 10x and now you made it again
Lol the Jojo music
6:30 The way jschlatt turned around and looked at his cardboard pope 🤣
THIS IS SO FUCKING FUNNY I CANT STOP LAUGHING
DID TOMMY JUST USE DESTINY 2 MUSIC (FARM THEME) 17:08 AHAWJHAW;KLWJARKLJ AELKSDFJ;LKWSETGJ;AEKLRFJELK;KRFJ;L USE IT MORE ITS SOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
Fuckworld will be missed 😔💔

Can't wait for Fuckworld's new EP: Bitches 'b' Growlin
I love how he’s using golden wind for his intro just like simecicle
Schlatt: gets struck by lightning  *turns to the pope* 6:26
When i saw the notification i cried from happiness 😢❤️❤️
1:25 *dream smp flashback*
LET GET TOMMY TO 10MIL

I like how Tommy played rlcraft with Boffy before but he acts like this is his first time.
Hope who ever sees this has a wonderful day!
It’s ok to cry
The fact Tommy asked jshlatt if he was ok after he got struck by lightning
JESUS loves you and will never leave you

Yup it was YouTube who unsubscribed people not them. Jk lol
PLEASE DO MORE!!! I WOULD WATCH 10000 DAYS IF YOU MAKE A 10000 DAYS SIRIES
The title should be "Minecraft's Hardest mod Is incredibly Funny"
Was that a Jojo reference 😏
And made 100000000000000 times harder
17:25 He fell into the lava and emerged scarred in more ways then one.....
Please just help me get up to the top of the comments because, I have no ideas... Please

All you need to defeat the battle tower boss is a fishing rod
Rip F*ckworld 2021-2021 o7
Please make this into a seris. SO FUNNY
fuckworld truly was fire
The best part about this video, is Jshlatt being proud of things I don’t believe people would be proud of. #1: falling through the floor. 😂
this may be my new comfort video
Schlatt you don't have to sacrifice your real life cat because of an in-game lightning...
hi

woa
If Tubbo and Wilbur were here they probably would've started another religion based off of a random creature they found in a lake
Noooooo ... Not the dog .... ʕ´• ᴥ•̥`ʔ
No. The hardest mod is using LatoOrigins (along with the Origins mod) and choosing a Cobblestonian. Don't forget using Hardcore Mode.
R.I.P Fuck world
you didnt really SURVIVE this mod.... you died about 28384825872587745739437917943689434839 times.

"Congrats to whoever is late💐" (like me😅)
Jschlatt knows this mod well because he played with Ph1lZa
I love how he started off bleeping out the curse words and then probably just gave up with bleeping them out lmao
Does anyone know how to make the small YouTube comment font in the comments. (On iPad)
“He’s thinking about some fucked up shit.” Schlatt:  *S M O O C H E S    C A T*
Mhhh dirty crime boy
HELLL YA WE LOVE WOMEN AND THE QUEEN
Schlatt should've started praying in spanish and added in a quackity clip of him praying as well
the sheer terror in EVERYONE's reaction when ANYTHING happens is quite the mood
U updated late and I got worried 🥺
Early
Tommy: We are playing a new mod! Charlie: Really? what is it? Tommy: RL craft! Charlie: *Vietnam Flashbacks*
0:08 tommy i wanna just hear the music can u shut up
I love how hes “teaching” you when you’ve played this before tommy-

bro tommyinnit is turning into charlie slimecice
Schaltt fuckworl no no
Have a good time watching this video CUZ WE DID NOT  Lol
An RLCraft series would be epic
Wait, they finished a challange? imposible
What I find most interesting is how the title says "I survived" and not "We survived" R.I.P JSchlatt and Charlie I guess  Edit: a sadder death than either of them. Rest In Peace, Fuckworld the dog
20:55 was the best when he said he brought a “friend”

Poor f#ckworld
RIP ⚰ "Fuckworld"
Schlatt has a heart attack 2.0

My Dads name was Bart so this vid really resonated with me

Lol
Thank the archon, I have been looking for something to watch for 30 minutes
Ive really enjoyed this it was very funny you know Tommy every mod video you release is funniest because you are init (also 100 days would be cool but try to do it with someone because 100 days are now pretty boring but with someone else it would be very funny)

Can’t be a TommyInnit vid without loud panting to start it off
20 mins and 10k comments tommy is popping off
I’m kinda early...
My trying to turn on notifications for tommy  YouTube: can’t turn on notifications for content made for kids. Me: you sure bout that.
HE USED GIRNO THEME
CONGRATS ON 9 MIL!!!! <333
This entire video was just one big war flashback for Slimecicle
here before #1 on gaming
Who else misses the original squad of Wilbur,tubbo,Tommy and Philza?
When Schlatt was sacrificing Jambo 😭💀
i'm just thinking about that time slimecicle played rlcraft      man, that was chaotic
Here before 1m views also epic video
I love this trio!!!
Anyone who think Tommy is a good beatboxer  | | |
me and my friends trying challenges like these  then we all fail halfway   ;-; lol
Jschlatt and his cat is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen (edit: Slimesicle’s rap was a banger)
Too ten rappers Eminem was to afraid to dis   1. Fuckworld                                                              2. Charlie
RIP Fuckworld, he died young
Love the vid!
did i cry when fuckworld died? maybe.
EArly Comment
Tommy is officially a jojo refrence
Rest In Peace f*ckworld.. o7   (17:39)
rip fuckworld, he was a great dog but an even greater friend
He didnt say this mod is funny, I think he's maturing
niceeeeeeeeee
Boffy be like: I thought you were my friend!
The opening reminded me so much a slimecicle's intros and I think its great that you could be taking inspiration (even if subconsciously) from other amazing creators like yourself.
wait     i thought this was old   recycled?
Tommy: **acting like hes never played this before** Me: **remembering when he played this with boffy 2 years ago**
real men cried when fuckworld died. Rest in peace fuckworld.
Omg I was craving your videos today <3
THE RAPPING WAS ACTUALLY SOLID
And here it is...
e
Do a hundred day series that would be cool
Once Tommy reaches 10 million I can celebrate from being at 80k subs :)
When tommy beats hardcore?

"Am I having a heart attack?!"  Dang, even out of roleplay Give Schlatt a break xD
Love the music at the beginning 👍

Schlatt: Am I having a heart attack?  Me: Oh, no, not again

Schlatt:  *struck by lightning? *agressive praying* *holds up cat to the pope* Me: dont sacrifice Jambo
Good think they brought Charlie for this. He's played before and was traumatized by it
F in chat for fckwrld
when you realise people might not find you that annoying because you have 9 million subscribers so you have to change your intro
RIP F—KWORLD 😭  2021-2021   forever remembered
More like surviving Minecraft’s hardest penis. (This is not to be rude it’s just a joke)
I like how tommy pretends he doesn’t know shit about RLcraft as if people wouldn’t remember that series he did with Boffy a while back.
rip f**kworld n the other one. last 17 mins
Jambo evertime hes in the video: bro wtf
Imagine TOMMYINNIT
Tommy: I Survived Minecraft's Hardest Mod... Also him: *Dies several times* *Press X to doubt*

R.i.p fuck world you will be missed😔
Rest In Peace Fuckworld
19 mins ago early?
rip fuckworld, you'll be missed 😞
It*
Not me genuinely crying when fuckworld died-
7:37 best scream i ever heard
Fun fact: The unsubscribing thing happens really really rare only 1% of people on youtube have encountered it. Its a trick to make you think you are subbed but then not subbed. Meaning youtube unsubbed you but actually you never subbed.
Jshlatt doing hit sacrifice killed me-
OMG I LOVE THIS IVE BEEN WAITING
Love you bro hope to meet you in real liFe love :)
Rip fuckworld F in the chat for him Also spit some bars in remembrance of him
Charlie, Schlatt and Tommy make a Iconic trio
Alternate title: Tommyinnit and friends try to survive the virtual wilderness and fail miserably
Fuckworld and the other one will be remembered
Tommyinnit is back once again yeaaaaaaaa
fuckworld will be missed rip
No one Absolutely no one A zombie apocalypse: Schlatt: I fell through the floor 🙃
6:20 P O L I S H
OMG SO EARLY
Great vid
This is how many times they said fuck 👇
There are so many dream stans in these comments all thinking their so special by copy and pasting the same comment about schlatt having a heart attack. We get it, please shut the fuck up now.
Terrible thumbnail, had a seizure, disliked.
The tower gave me serious jschlatt and Phil Hexxit nostalgia
shlatt: Oh my left arm damaged. Am I having heart attack?  me: **flashbacks from Dream Smp lore**
E
Love iy
You guys should do the Terraria Calamity mod, that'd be pretty chaotic.
rest in peace fuckworld 2021-2021
rip fuckworld, rip the other one
Why does Schlatt get censored but not tommy
Yes
Me watching this at school:
9.9mil yes Tommy

The fact that he named it mod and not modpack must make the mod creators cry
LETS GO OLD TOMMY VIBES ARE BACK, WOOOOOOOOOOO AND THE SONG, AH I LOVED THTA AND MISSED THAT WO

The next time I come out to someone I'll just say "Ah yes, I'm a women enjoyer 😌"
First few seconds of the vid- Hyperventilating..
remember when tommy played this with boffy? good times
wheres the "stupidly funny" or "insanely funny" 😠😠😠😡😡😡😡😡
Poggers
Rlcraft pog
Rest in peace fuckworld and the other one

I have been waiting for this
hey im here early. theres just bots als DONT SACRIFICE JAMBO NOO FUCKWORLD
Rip fuckworld
Woohoo 17 mins
Ive been looking forward to this
Fuckworld and the other one are like me and my sibling to my parents
Why swear words are censored? Anyway at 10M subs that means diamond play button that means... A HELL LOT OF MONEY
Everyone dying a freaking out   Shlat: I’m stuck in the wall 😁
R.I.P Fuckworld 2021-2021 Press F to pay respect.
wow, you're only 2 years late!
Me who clears towers in a few seconds
75% of this comment section are bots trying to get you to sub to them
Tommy: What difficulty do you want  Slimecicle: Yes
The way schlatt gets struck by lightning and then starts praising the pope 😭
Slimecicle be having ptsd
o7s for fuckworld
Not fuck word
I think tommy's parents were sleeping in this one
Tommy I NEVER UNSUBSCRIBE TO YOU
This is canon to the Slimecicle Cinematic universe since Charlie still has PTSD to his RLCraft experience
No fuckworldddddddd
omg POGCHAMP
Is that a Jojo reference?
Tinny I hope you know you have to make like millions more Now
I think it's really cool that tommy has stopped packing the descriptions with keywords, and started putting nice messages.     It's like we get a little message from Tom, rather than tommy :D
I love that Charlie is here guiding you, his RLcraft video was probably one of my favorites
flashback to when boffy and tommy did this a long time ago
Where is phil when we need him?

"He's actually completely fluent in spanish" *inhales*    El Tratado de Versalles fue un tratado de paz que se firmó en dicha ciudad al final de la Primera Guerra Mundial por más de cincuenta países.1​ Este tratado terminó oficialmente con el estado de guerra entre la Alemania del segundo Reich y los Aliados de la Primera Guerra Mundial. Fue firmado el 28 de junio de 1919 en la Galería de los Espejos del palacio de Versalles, exactamente cinco años después del atentado de Sarajevo en el que fue asesinado el archiduque Francisco Fernando, (en alemán: Franz Ferdinand) la principal causa de la Primera Guerra Mundial. A pesar de que el armisticio fue firmado meses antes (11 de noviembre de 1918) para poner fin a las hostilidades en el campo de batalla, se necesitaron seis meses de negociaciones en la Conferencia de Paz de París para concluir el tratado de paz. El Tratado de Versalles entró en vigor el 10 de enero de 1920.
