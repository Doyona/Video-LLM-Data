Do you w use green screen
Their camera/editing team is amazing. They should have a OT video where they switch places.
Anyone 2025?
Which is better illusions or trick shots? BOTH
Zac “ we are not gonna break a leg or anything”  Also Zac *slam dunks and makes a wall fall*

Dude perfect 5 best friends that believe in the lord in heaven. And 5 guys who agreed in collage to start videos for YouTube hoping they would make it to the big leagues Well look at them now Dude perfect they all care about us they care about each other and there so so funny but there is A  1 in a billion chance you make it to big leagues and with team work cooperatively working together and the best work partners. They did it FOR US! They care and they always will And because  you fans showed the love they are able to start new channels keep up the love and support.❤️
Love the Ned cut out at 2:26
Jesus loves you
I feel like coby was really passionate about this video and he was excited to do the shots and that made me feel good to know that he has very interesting (in a good way) interests.
Are you a trick shots fake I personally don’t think so but it’s been a mess going around
Why do Americans have to spend their lives screaming?
Ty’s cornhole trickshot was more impressive when they zoomed out
0:33 that tan line
3:03 he is such a child LOL

Awesome
seeing how this all works out is so cool I wish that I could do this.
you guys  are the best
they will do it so hard but í can do that for the first time
I watched this before the actual trick shot video
Can y’all do a trick shot video mixed with stunts? 🙏 that would be such an amazing video
This is absolutely amazing.. 😂😂🔥
You guys have such an amazing team. Ryan is so inventive
4:50 Its been over 40 years since Pablo Picasso passed away, to be honest.
I am Actualy from south Africa. It is super bad to live there because there is so much Violence there.I was 4 when i left.
When the behind the scenes is better than the video itself-
Love ❤️
😍😍😍
03:43 Zac is SO comfortable in his own skin, it's like he's the biggest star between everyone. What's amazing and important to mention is that both of these platforms have large teams behind them.
They all looked like giants when they stood in front of that slanted room. Loved how Ty was like "lookit I'm smol ty! now I grew, I'm huge ty woo!" like a little kid.
Me trying to understand ,what is going on 🤔
WHO IS IN THE PANDA SUIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i'm dumb I know
who is panda ?
Both Zach King and D P are amazing 👏
Tiny ty and tytan
1:12 the camera man OP🔥
i love trick shots
Whoa!
The boiling porter strangely grate because lynx rationally embarrass off a awful rate. festive, waggish sail
the upside down basket ball trick shot
This one was so awesome guys
Where is panda man 🤔🤔
loved this video !!!
When zach told it's permanent paint 😂😂😂😂😂🙃
The psychotic fan conventionally clip because curtain descriptively soothe out a elated venezuelan. bent, different motorcycle
I like Ball thick shot
I like how their twins but look nothing alike
Love both of you
sooo cool video!
Thwy teach me more engineering than my engineering teacher
2 of my favorite YouTuber’s!!!!
What camera are you guys filming with?
Great video
E
I am from South Africa
God loves you and I do too!!!
I love this trick shot
Song???
Dude perfect can’t even dunk they need the trampoline for that but whoever watch 2hype give me a thumbs up 👍 in 2hype lsk( kristipor London) can dunk !!!
Lol admit it. Who else was a day or two late 😅😂
this video is so cool!!!
When chad put his glasses on was the funniest stuff in the video 🤣🤣🤣
This just shows you how much work they put into their videos. Its not just guys shooting hoops in their backyard anymore. Well done. Favorite collab yet!
2:25 that front flip tho
3:36 i feel like zach was disappointed by it
What happened to the race in the regular video? Is it coming next week?
Does anybody knows where can I find the background soundtrack?
WHEN ZACH SAID HE PAINTED TY WITH NON ACRYLIC PAINT, AHHAHAHAAHAHAHAHA LMAO
let's gooo, the old music is back
That coby and cory look a like mirror trickshot was 200iq
This was insanneeeee
The twin scenes were awesome!
So excited for tour! This new video it awesome!
I love their Behind the scene 😍
=
=
===/
V F.  Rf ;  … £
Could Zach be panda 🤔🤔🤔
This is the moment we've all been waiting for
So you could say the mirror shot was heavily.... cory-ographed 😏
I was so excited for this one
Trick shot haven't been one for a while
Can we appreciate the camera man at 1:10 to 1:17
Thank y’all! So awesome!  To everyone: Jesus loves you so so much and He died so we can be forgiven and go to Heaven with God if we accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior! Have a great day! God bless everyone!
They found the best way to get a dead trend trending again
I mean it pays off to have twins to help out
Man, DP is a classic!
2:27 what a edit
Now THIS is something I wanna watch
“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” - John 3:16

Tyler didn’t know when Picasso died at 4:49 😂
Intro and outro music is undefeated
"Your favorite illusion!"
The camera man in the intro
went to Jacksonville tour show .team COBY . p.s. someone tried to fake garrets death (not true)
I absolutely love this new video cause I love Zac and I love Dude Perfect.
Haha
I was so excited for this one. SO MUCH WORK goes into this kind of stuff!!!!
At 2:26 I was like, "Was that Ned...?" but then I realized it was a cardboard cutout
One is caught up playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self🎈
Noice
Bill Gates and Company is releasing 750 million genetically modified mosquitoes in Florida. Call Ron DeSantis. It must be stopped now. True story.
Why didn't they show how they "got inside" the Overtime TVs? xD
Tricks shots are back
Love Zack 🔥
When people ask, What Social Influencer or youtuber do you want to be, I say Dude perfect because they have so much fun on their job! My favorite youtuber are you guys. Especially since the the only thing people want do do know a days is game, and I actually want to enjoy my life even when I lose.
yall are amazing
Loved the twins one in the bathroom
This is your first trick shots in forever and this is the best one yet
I love when he try's to dunk and instead go's flying
This video is epic
3:11 Fun fact: Inception was by far NOT the first movie to do the rotating room trick. The first instance of it could be found in a Fred Astaire movie Royal Wedding from 1951.
❤🎇😱🤯
Does anyone think the behind the scenes intro song is better than the main channel intro song
"painted with non-acrilic paint" LMAO!!
Cobyyyyyyy
2:28 Gotta Flex
I love that the trick shots are finally back
The collab that we have all been waiting for! 😁
Never heard of this Zach guy. Why did you not link his stuff?
Ty- I've been here over 60 years since Picasso passed away Also Ty- When did he die?     *******laughing like helll***
Zach literally  painted Ty with real paint.
This clear my wonders why their videos take so long
Best dp +
The best Video Ive seen in a long time thanks
LOVE the twin mirror scene!!!
Holy cow, Chad that part where you hoverboarded as you filmed was epic man!! Bet you do that all the time right, you're really good!!
That close up on  DP production guy…  I’m DYING🤣

Garret ok
Coby- “I don’t want this to become a stunt channel.” Chad- “I DO.” 😏
.
ARE YOU SERIOUS!!!!!😂😂😂😂
Yes
Ty thought we wouldn't notice ol' Ned at 2:24 .......   BUT WE DID!!!!
hi
3:44 that actually reminds me of a scene from an episode of the old TUFF Puppy Nickelodeon show called "Share a Lair" 😂😂😂😂. It's basically a bathroom trickery scene
It would be so cool to visit the DP headquarters. Just think go karts, trampoline park, basketball court, and a lot lot more. Wow you guys are hard workers and I love how you guys love the Lord! Big fan!
Can you do more face offs please
Hello Zach king magic 🪄
GIANT AIR HOCKEY GO KART BATTLE!

It is soooooooooo cool that they got the guys from Inception to work with them.
Who is all going to the dp show because I am
great collab.
That was Super Cool Good job doing that DP
Wow that’s like magic but I liked it! Y’all should do more!
Legends of the YouTube world, imagine how long this would take
This would have to say I love illusions takes a long time but definitely worth it
2:27 is that a new meme?
The collab we always wanted but never asked🤩🤩🤩
Hacksmith
