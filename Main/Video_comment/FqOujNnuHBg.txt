My new Gen-2 Rebel Cases are FINALLY in stock! Thank you for supporting 💪 https://phonerebel.com/products/rebel-gen-2-series
13 is 13! 14 is 13s! 😢
ok Youtube I will watch this and crazy work we did on it hahaha
hello I’m one year into the future and I could confirm that the iPhone 13 is gonna look the same as the 12 but the top notches is 20% smaller on each side but a little long longer also the camera bump on the 12 will just be a lot bigger and the cameras will look a lot bigger but the layout of everything it’s gonna be the same as the 12 so the mini, the regular model, the pro, and pro max model will all be the same as each other like minis and the regular model will not have AR sensors. It is going to have a A15 chip in it. You also get cinematic mode and you can change after you recorded it. You also get one terabyte model and new colors Sierra blue and Alpine green.
I’m watching on an iPhone 13 pro, I’m going to see how accurate this is
Watching this after the release of iphone 13
Leaks are correct🤣
🤡
What about Car Play???? I can’t plug my phone to the car?
A portless iphone is enough to make me want to end it there Wireless charging is terribly inefficient and theres no way to use non bluetooth headphones
Should I buy a iPhone XR or 11 or 11 pro or 12 for apple if I get one next year since I’m upgrading from my iPhone se 2020 next year. Or should I buy a S10 or S10+ or S20 or S21 any suggestions guys
But can a IPhone 12 from this year became an Always on display as well like when IOS15 canes out ??
Apple just getting the always on display??? In 2021 LMFAO MY 2016 Samsung had it
Nah, I don’t think that the iPhone 13 will be portless
🙁😯
Very very very very nice good
Wait 13
wow
All I am looking for 13 is an aluminum body on 3 sides.. to use without case.. I don't want another feature to be added 😂
Wassup guy’s everything here apple pro here.......
Yes I want the 13!
30 bucks for a case? 🤣🤣 3 usd from China, free shipping
Hope that the Iphone 13 Pro will still have the charging port. I will wait for it to be release. Without it I wont be able to sync any of my favorite music. And the MagSafe is also expensive. Thanks for the video.
so it turns out the 13 will use 20% less power due to new displays, etc. which is major. as for portless charging thats fine im sick of cleaning pocket lint out my port anyway.
So tired of feeling like I am paying for a camera just to get a larger screen/battery/processor, I would be happy with an 8mpxl rear only camera.... So BS!
Your case is too bulky. I already returned it
https://youtube.com/channel/UCTg3i4NXyPUFuSte_pYQ76Q
Well im going to wait for the touch screen  feature to be added either 13 or 14, 8+ is great for me and touch id is bomb
I love the iPhone 13
When is the iPhone 13 coming out
It might be just me but I don’t like the thought of an iPhone 13. The number just doesn’t sit well with me... 🥺
They starting to disappoint me every year... 11 pro max right now, just might go Android next year
Which processor does the iPhone work?
Realace date
Will the camera lens be under the glass instead of protruding out like in mock up here cause that would be awesome if that’s the case I don’t really like the protruding camera
man i just got the 12 pro max :/
Bought a 12 pro max for the fact I want my charge port
chances of a new SE being unveiled at the upcoming Apple event?
Fake!!!!!
I find the boxy camera very bad looking making it just like other phones,what really made iPhone stand out ia the unique camera design on the back...
I just got into astrophotography so I'm pumped
I want apple to make the camera have more pixels
Samsung>Apple
Without that dam charging port. Idk if i should wait for the iphone 13 or just get the 12😩🥲
Finally I can buy iPhone 5 now
Just got the iPhone 12 Pro😄
Bro a phone 13 almost coming got the 12 only 4 days ago
I don't think iphone will be full wireless charging because they are not as fast as wired charging maybe they will do it in 2030
For what reason makes you think ‘portless’ will even happen in the next decade? Or even ever? It’s certainly not a green way to go at the moment as the top technology for this at the moment is barely 50% efficient. It just wouldn’t make sense.
2:58 Subtle product placement
All they gotta do is make it thicker. I like the weight of the 4s felt like you paid for something bring that back
Can’t wait am still using my iPhone SE
Are you selling Nike now too?
Im going to Samsung if apple cut the port out like wtf why just not you USBc like everyone else
Can I get one 🤣?
Welp guess I’m getting a 12 pro max
I’m literally not buying it if there’s not gonna be a charging port
iPhone 13 is funny name I dont even buy new phones, intact I prefer android, but 13 is funny
There is a 75% chance of a 60% chance the notch will be reduced by 5%
Me being exited for the iPhone 13 knowing I can’t afford it 😭😭
i don't think apple would remove all ports , if this happen how  apple carplay will work in my car ????
Waiting for iphone 13 because of 120 hertz and bigger battery
iphone 13 will not come
Imagine if the price 💰 was lowered, they would be the world’s most richest do to all the affordable purchase plus the world got hit by Covid-19 so everyone income is not that big
Iphone is amazing  Bought the galaxy s21 ultra  And iphone looks like garbage compared to it  But still iphone fan
What’s with the Nike plug, did I miss something?
the always on thing has been around for like 8 years now
That dark camera cover with the iPhone shape is perhaps the sexist thing I’ve seen 😭 does anyone know if it’s possible to add a dark glass camera cover to iPhone 12 Pro Max
If future iPhones remove the charge port, I won’t be able to upgrade/have to go back to Android unless they find a way to make CarPlay work for cars that don’t support wireless CarPlay. (I’m not buying a new car just for CarPlay)
Collected all my money for iphone 13 , apple just take my money and give me ur iphone 🤤🤤
I miss you I’m glad you’re back
They just gotta make a device that's gonna be premium for years. instead of slowly increasing the specs just to get us to buy it repeatedly
The violet feather dentsply stay because knight occasionally deceive versus a clear flax. lewd, impossible cheek
Portless iPhone 13 isn’t happening. Also it will be called iPhone 13 not 12s.
Any news on the Apple Watch series 7?
https://youtu.be/bITPTBO3C94
120 HZ most important. Realy waiting
I like the fingerprint scanner being put somewhere, but hate having to lift up my phone to unlock it. Also, how will portless work w Apple CarPlay? I guess the same.
They can’t take away the charging port. The phones don’t last all day and the magsafe does not transfer data. So that would be a horrific move on there part. I have a 12 so I could care less about the 13. I will say if apple continues there shenanigans with there iPhone line the 12 phone will be my last iPhone.
Tf the iphone12 just came out 5 months ago
not loving the camera module...
The unknown scorpio concurringly frighten because screen histochemically blot afore a brash weasel. shocking, lazy death
Sticking with my product red iPhone 12 mini. The one that no one bought but everyone wants.
Please android funboys dont watch this video none asked about your comments
Remember when y'all were outraged that Apple removed the headphone Jack? And then what happened afterwards? Oh yeah
Yeah right, it will be basically the same boring crap, with very small improvements
why nobody likes the mini ??? 🥲 i hope apple continue producing it. 🙏🏻
2022: apple removed the  IPhone speaker and u should buy a wireless speaker for your iPhone lol
I don't have any reason to buy an iPhone ☹️
No charging port would be crap for the battery, crap for charging anywhere really. Half my friends don’t even have wireless chargers. And how do I get my data from the iPhone to my pc? How do i use Apple CarPlay then?
My dream phone would be the iPhone 12 with touch-ID!
When Iphone 13 will be droped?
Who else came here through MKBHD's link?
What's the phone most use?
I have a iPhone XS, waiting for iPhone 14
Does anyone know around when the iPhone 13 will be released?
Dude you have so many ads in your videos now that I can’t even watch it... drives me nuts. Figured I would leave you this feedback as I do appreciate your content but I cannot continue to watch with an ad every other minute
Please give me one phone because I'm poor 🥺
been watching you since 2014 i love ur content
im happily living with my 8plus stil :)
One question regarding the "portless" iPhone: How do I get my pictures taken with the iPhone to "any" PC? There is no "direct WiFi-AirPlay"-Connection possibility, or is there?
i have iphone 11 pro max and till notchless iphone , gonna use this ...
Can i have a phone? Pleaseee🥺
Please make Gen2 compatible with older iPhones as well! Gen1 looks great but Gen2 looks even better
Nice
I can’t wait to see what the 13 looks like
Titanium iPhones ? 🥰🥰🥰
it’s basically a android
Iphones are basically beginners phones. If your new to phones or technology get an iPhone because they are very basic and simple too use but if you want a real phone that can do anything get android. Android phones are alot more advanced and your getting way more for your money by buying Android.
It's good to see you again ❤️❤️❤️
Apple is trus
and Iam just here to know what colors will be available since I really liked the 11 ones...
Waiting for Apple 17
Will we be able to have the mag adapter on the crystal series
Sorry for the question but whats the difference by unlocking a Tesla with the U1 Chip or by bluetooth?
Basically stick with the 12 for another year waste of money
Hey dude I know you probably get a lot of people wanting stuff from you but hear me out on this one. I am only 14 years old and trying to get a new phone for my mom because it is her birthday on the16th of march and she broke her phone last week, I know that a lot of people break there phones and can buy a new one but my mom doesn't have enough money and I am trying to work to help to get more money so I can help her out but I just cant work enough. so all I am asking, is a 14 year old kid that is struggling in school and at home and I am just wanting to get something for my mom. it doesn't even have to be a new iPhone or anything it can be like an iPhone 5 or 6 or 10 or 12. I just want to help my mom this year and i look up to you as a inspirational person and want to help my mom this year. Thank you so much, From Phoenix. Let me know if you can call 0483890023. Thanks this would make my year. Love your videos.
The s21 ultra is a way better phone than the iPhone 12 pro Max in many ways.they are so far ahead of the iPhone that the next iPhone won't even have all of the features that the s21 ultra has now like adaptive refresh rate, 1,500 nits, 100 times zoom, 108 megapixel camera, 8K video, the smallest hole punch, on any phone, reverse wireless charging, recording from three cameras at the same time, single take mode and a macro camera. There are many more but I cannot remember them right now. When you see these features on the iPhone 14 do not think that Apple made these features because like usual they are just stealing the features from the last Samsung. Wach the video 5 ways that the Samsung s21 ultra destroyes the iphone 12 pro max.
Did the dude in this video ever come out of the closet?
How would you connect the iPhone to car play with out a port?
I just got my Crystal case today. Looks pretty good with the product red iPhone 12.
Watching on my iPhone 7, it might be time
If protless will happen, there won’t just be a blank part we’re the port was. There’re will be more speaker holes.
Wow so were really getting an 1tb iphone 13 this year
I wonder of they have plans to bring an iphone mini 13
Nice vid but Nike add¿
ahhhhhhhhhh. why don't they remove the notch yet. i was considering which to buy between s21 and iPhone 12, ended up with s21 just because of the notch.
Why don't u work at apple 🍎
sir ye baat sarkar tak kese pahuchaye
ow iphone 13 the battery is not upgrade then add a 120hz 😎😎😎😎 easy battery drain??
this vid is a whole lot of NOTHING
Are these still allegations or are they facts now since its a couple of months away?
So how will the Port-less Iphone hook up to the carplay in my car, that must be connected to the phone?
Can i have your old model of iphone 🥺
I was tempted to get the 12 pro but I decided to hold on to the 11 and get the 2021 iphone this year.
Do homepod mini
Auto you said the thickness will be growing. Pause
Can u plzzzzzz do a vid of the new dotes xs11 with 3 cámaras there prob fake though but still
Who’s here from mkbhd video ?
Touch ID?
Don’t like the idea of no charger port. Idk how I am gonna backup my photos, especially RAW files without the port. Unless, Apple figures something out with the wireless mag thing.
Brilliant Bro...      Sanjankamat1998@gmail.com
Man, I use CarPlay a ton in my vehicle. Removing the port would kill that option.
If it’s the same form factor with upgrades, it’s an S model. Happy to see them back!
*me watching this with an iPhone 6s :* 👁💧👄💧👁
Who's watching this video after watching MKBHD video?
Marques brought me here
Were not ready for portless iPhones imo. How do we charge them on the move? When driving? It's really not logical carrying a wireless charger around with you. Some cars don't have them yet either.
Too many ads bro
They could put the Touch-ID in the power button again like the iPad Air (or Pro idr which one they put the Touch ID in)
I’m never impressed with iPhone updates- updates on iPads and MacBook are much more of interesting lately. I’m super pumped about ARM MacBook pros
You have 1 iPhone 13
iPhone 12 made the most selling phone in history imagine iPhone 13!
Sup Philip
Waiting for Iphone 20
if there is in screen fingerprint scanner does that mean face id will be removed? or will they keep both (seems like what the video is suggesting with the two locks side by side)
EAP: “confirmed”  MKBHD: *heavy breathing*
Heart: iphone 11 mind: Xs max wallet: Realme.🙄😅😅😊
I have an iPhone 12PM right now, my first iPhone since the 4s. When the change the case design, I probably won't have one anymore. The square design is the best, hands down.  Same with Portless phone. "Wireless" charging is far too inefficient and useless. Entirely too much heat generated resulting in battery life lost, and energy wasted. Going to wireless charging is worse for the environment than taking out the brick is helping. Though that doesn't help anyone but Apple. End-users still suffer for that one.
I know I'm weirdo who even likes touch bar but, I'm really waiting for port-less iPhone.
samsung already has this ....
I honestly love Touch ID and the new features they are planning on putting in on the phone it’s great so far but the price 🥴
Your videos are not showing automatically by YouTube ! I have to find it by searching myself, although being a subscriber. Really appreciate your informations! Love ❤️ from 🇮🇳 INDIA
All the new features (120Hz, AOD, Periscope Camera) can already be found on Android phones long long time ago. "Innovative" company.
Your name is Philip? I learned that through Mkhbd
It’s time to stop spreading fake news
Marques raid...
I think they won’t bring iPhone 13 mini
Is it coming with fingerprints???? Ugh i want in screen fingerprint
Bruh I just got my iPhone 12 Pro Max chill
Why did you put the Nike hat on mid video. Thought you were gonna then say apple working with Nike on some running software or something. Or maybe you just felt cold loool.
Waiting For iphone 13 So After It's Launch iPhone 11 Price Will Be Dropped ❤️
Lol
I think people are wrong about apple just makes money  and make the same iPhone cause if u see the prototypes we will be able to understand nothing and the prototypes cost about million dollars
Also hoping for less tall notch instead of less width. Because otherwise it will look like android phones from 2018, which is baaaaad.
Like people did u not see the front of the phone?? It looks hideous!👀
It's been literally 4 years since apple introduced notch, everytime they are about to start the making of a new phone Tim Cook comes into the meeting room and says "we'll talk about the notch next year"
Who has come after MKBHD..
Apple are u waiting for all the people to switch to android because of that hideous notch!?
I like apple but apple is not at the same level with Android yet, they are picking up old features from Android and implementing them in iOS. Hopefully, iPhones will get on the same level as android when the 15th generation launches but we'll see👀
Why do apple have to make the line up names so confusing and incosistent
I'm here from MKBHD. Not a new viewer been watching you for years 😁
*Who else is back here again after Marques "dropped a link below"...?*  😊👍
After mkbhd
Watching this on a fake iPhone 12 Pro Max. I love when apple just won't release all this lol
If apple takes away the port I am switching to Driod. It's a hard decision, as andriod phones only last 3 years, while apple's last 6, but I just can't take this pointless anti-consumer behavior.
Came here from MKBHD video. 😊
Always wondered if MKBHD new this guy. Now it was CONFIRMED and it was pleasent to see an amalgamation of good coments about Philip
Wondering how many more ppl subscribe after mkbhd plugged eap?
anyone from MKBHD here?
They didn’t skip the 11s , this year was a new design dumb dumb. Can’t call it a « s » model
Can’t wait to order up my 13 pro max !
Hello!i believe that your name is Philip so i'll call you that !! I miss your videos so much and i hope you'd come back soon Love you 💗💗 from Egypt
Seriously that many ads
Drop the mini and make a Plus version. Same size as pro max but not as expensive
NOTHING COMPARE TO APPLE!!! ❤️❤️❤️
so MagSafe to 3.5mm adapter? $19.99+ lol
Wtf $30 for a case  lol
i have to buy 12 or wait 13 ?
Upgrades we need  1) Better Battery life than 3-5K Mah (12 pro max is descent not as good as 11PM )  2) Definitely something useful compared to Wide and Ultra lens / Let’s hope this new mode and stabilizer will be amazing like we know Apple can but will they  3 MaG Safe won’t be here long it’s just not something people need/want  4 Definitely a more Affordable line up S20 FE / IPhone 13 Range for people upgrading  5 Touch ID will definitely be a selling point
Port-less?? Please no... the MagSafe charges so damn slow...
I’m skipping this one, I have the 12 pro max and I love it. I know the iPhone 14 will be more different and I keep saying this but like hopefully that notch gets smaller or disappear soon...
Sir give me i phone please
Do you sell your products in India or in the east Asia.
can anyone send me an iphone💔
beautiful Nike brand advertisement
Artisan mouse pad I see you are a man of culture
Are You asking why Apple skipped the 11s naming? Where have you been Man, OMG. Did you know what happened on September 11. I Think that u have to review ur videos to some one else before Making them public.
I don’t care if they drop they Lightning port, if wireless charging is fast enough. Imagine loading ur phone in the morning from 2% to 100% while u take ur morning shower or what ever.  In this case time wouldn’t be the problem and using it while charging is still possible.... 🤨 so what’s the problem?
Apple gives us too little  for the money we  spend.
Your the only one who give us good apple contents, but  the notch has been here too long now , that why am now a galaxy person.
so all in all everything stays the same
Plzzzz give  me new  mobile   i have  2 gb  rank   mobile  pplzzz give  me  new  mobile plzzzz     plzzz olzzzz pkzzzz plzzzz
This channel has the most commercials !!!!!!
How many ads you making is watch man? I’ve hit 4 and I’m half way through the video.
These you tubers HAVE TO STOP WITH THE COMMERCIALS FOR THEIR OWN CRAP. CRRRRRINGE
We wanted USB C for years and guess what they gave us? No lightning OR usb c!!!
From Anh Em TV with love🖥🖥🖥🖥🖥📱📲

I strongly recommend you to *GUSTAVO_TOOLS* on Instagram he helped me unlock my device in no time , I think you should try him too🙏
Gosh might as well go with iPhone 11 pro max not the  12 series by Apple they got u to pay for a piece of crap like a unfinished product go just go with iPhone 13 if u dont like it not having a charging port  I’m willing to give it a shot with the iPhone 13 pro lol pretty big leap tho with no charging port but it won’t change much with my battery pack 😂 just means it should be more dust / water proof
This is true ?
iPhone   Battery Battery Battery Battery Battery Battery Battery Battery Battery Battery Battery Battery Battery Battery Battery Battery Battery Battery Battery Battery   Huge Disappointment
iPhone battery sucks
Waiting for no notch
I’m still rocking the iPhone 10s max
Big thanks to *Cyberwizard015* on Telegram for unlocking my new phone, he's really fast and trusted. I highly recommend him as the best.

hi there been watching u forever now quick question is there anyway u can remove activation lock for free
sticking with my XR till flip phone
My fav iPhone is 4s white. I have now an iPhone 6 in gold since 2015 and due to its age I went to some shops to check for a new phone, but I don’t really like the new iPhone designs unfortunately ☹️ My husband has the XS Max and he is kinda pushing me to get a new phone, but “No Ma’am!”😂 After the 8 plus models, I was a bit disappointed 😔
I hope they will have a lavender purple pro max or a Barbie pink
🙏🏼
Well, guess my iPhone 12 Pro is my last Apple phone. My SAAB doesn't have all that fancy shit for Wifi/Apple CarPlay for my stereo. Without the  capability to use and Aux I'm out.
When dumbshit thinks 30 dollar is nothing for a shitty case! ITS 3HRS OF SOMEONES LIFE WORKING!

Iphone My Favorite Mobile 😊
Twitter is making me very mad. A leak was confirmed and now everyone thinks the iPhone 13 is released 🤦‍♂️
This guy used to be so excited now he's seems blah, tim cooks apple is not steve jobs apple, two different men two different brains, steve thought of innovation , tim cook has a degree in business and looks to save a dollar or make a dollar , no innovation!!..Innovation sounds like spending money to tim cook, these "maybes" for iphone are features android has had for years , as an example right now on my note 20 ultra , I'm watching YouTube and on twitter , on the same screen....the screen splits horizontal and vertical , insane right! I can make youtube take up most of the screen 75% and have twitter take up 25% and vice versa and that's with everything not just youtube , watch a movie and surf web SAME SCREEN...I used to love apple but not anymore I will never be used by a company and KNOW it!✌️
Lets remove the port so no one can use apple car play anymore. That makes sense. I call bullshit.
About freaking time I been waiting for something really different in iphones altho late to the game but a 120hz was very necessary in a pro model
let me summarize for you. go to macrumor.
Apple: "Here's EVERYTHING, again, that not only Android users have already been celebrating for years, with more customization options as well, but...EVERYTHING we should have put in your iPhone 12...as long as you get the most EXPENSIVE option, of course!"  God...what a terrible con artist company...Apple consumers are true enablers.
My iPhone 12pro drains battery like any and screen freezes; it happened after 2recent iOS updates! pls comment what to do!
EVERYONE: Apple, please switch the port to USB-C!  APPLE: Ya know what? No ports for you.
So no charging port. Will the wireless charging be as fast as fast charging port? Can't actually use phone while charging then. I don't like this feature
So glad I skipped the 12 I’ve been saving for something this might be what I get I’ve had a 7 for like 3 years almost
Should be a different spec If  iPhone 12 pro max 6.7/battery 3+++ mah IPhone 13 pro max should be 6.9./Battery 4+++mah
wireless charging is already a no. i really wanted to upgrade too, might just go with the 12.
The notch is still there😒😒😒
Waiting for iPhone 31 😔.. Damn....
Love listening to MKBHD and JP and Zone of tech and Mrwhosetheboss etc but this guy is also the real deal. Very tech savvy and lettered. Cool dude
Always on is pointless, had it for years on Samsungs and never used it. Can we not get rid of the silence button on the side it’s old tech, put it in the control centre.
Can you please do a Pokémon go hack
Don’t buy the new iPhones without charging port, lets protest!
7:51 was that a voice crack
So how am I gonna use headphones with a jack?
Everyone: remove the annoying notch  Apple: ok let's remove charger port😉👍  Also apple fans: apple keep removing stuff but I'ma still buy it🤦‍♀️🤦‍♂️
While y'all complaining about the charger port, don't worry apple just doing ps5 move, making 2 version like charger port and digital iphone
Where are you man?? Miss you
I'd really like to try an iPhone, it's closer to Android now, but that notch, nah
I have the Xr and I’m probably going to wait for the iPhone 14 or 15. Hopefully by then they will actually innovate
Someone should tell the apple company to use it's money to save the environment, and not it's product. Maybe would gain more users.
Return my 12 pro max for iPhone 13🤗
Insightful
WTF I JUST GOT 12
Me work for appl
I really wish my life got an iPhone 12, help me get a device I love you from Tunisia 🥺💔
Is this channel are your https://youtu.be/iCevMitrCNw
To the person who is reading this, you are very precious and valuable even if you don't feel like it. Jesus loves you ❤️ He paid a price on the cross for you. He rose again on the third day and defeated death. He took the punishment for our sins, in our place. He did this out of his inconceivable love for us. He can revive your situation no matter how messed up it is. Don't end your life at any point. There is hope in Jesus. He is able to deliver you from sins. He is able to take away your depression, loneliness and suicidal thoughts etc., He is able to heal your sickness and disease. You just have to humble yourself and call out to him "wholeheartedly" and he will answer you. He set me free from porn addiction and masturbation in 2018 which I struggled with for almost 10 years. He saved me from three death traps. He changed my lustful heart. He can transform your life if you let him. You just have to repent from your sins and transfer your trust from yourself to Jesus. He is able to give you peace which surpasses all understanding, even in the midst of trials and tribulations. Fear won't grip you anymore because you will receive the assurance of eternal life when you believe in Jesus. He is the only way to heaven. He paid our fine by shedding his sinless blood for our sins. We sin through our thoughts, words and actions. The shed blood of Jesus will cleanse us from all our sins if we confess our sins to Jesus and repent from it. Our good works cannot get us to heaven. Those are like a bribe to the judge of the universe. This is a very serious thing.   We never know when our last minute on earth is. It could be any second, hour or day from now and if we don't have forgiveness for our sins, we will end up in Hell. We cannot take our money, riches or fame with us when we die. It is appointed for men once to die and after this the judgment. We have to give an account of our life to God. We only have a chance to repent till we are alive on this earth. This decision which we make in this present life will decide where we spend our eternity. Please think about this. Don't let pride stop you from knowing the truth. I was prideful before and rebelled against the living God and forsook the truth just because I didn't want to lose. If you humble yourself and call on to Jesus from wherever you are and ask him "sincerely" if all these things are true, he will reveal it to you. He will open your heart to the truth. You can experience him personally if you try it. Jesus is coming soon. If we have not repented from our sins and turned to him, we will end up in hell. This is not a religion. This is a relationship with God. I am telling all this because I care for you. Even though I don't know you personally, I know that your soul is extremely precious to God. The reason I am posting it here is because we never know when our last moments are. It could be anytime from now and I don't want you to end up in hell. Jesus is the only one who can save you from your sins and grant you everlasting life, after life on earth ends. May Jesus reveal himself to you. God bless you. Take care.
Been following for a long time! Forbes has used this a large reference for the upcoming iPhone 13! So cool
They make phones every year now like chill tf down we need to upgrade every year
Was waiting to get a 13 Pro Max but I don’t have Bluetooth in my car 🥲🥲
give free magsafe if no port charge
Just switched to apple from Samsung and will be holding onto my pro max until at least the 14 comes out
Hi Filip. Do you experience this also with your iPhone 12 Pro Max? Wherein At startup the Apple logo flashes super bright for a brief second then the screen goes dark for about 10 seconds before the Apple Logo re-appears at normal brightness to finish the startup.  https://youtu.be/Tap66n7axzM
Filip! Really good to have you back man, but please make sure to take care of yourself first, please. Hope you are hanging in there, I was going to say I hope everything is OK but I know it might not be. Nonetheless, thank you so much for all of the content🙏🏽
I wish  I could have this in the future
Stop making stupid acronyms EAP is dumb
12mini😒
iPhone 13 nomore phone in the box....
I want ceramic shield on the front glass and gorilla glass victus on the back of the iPhone 13
I personally like the idea of portless.
2:58 ??? why did you wear this hat? 🤔
jesus christ, who in the world would actually require a god damn TERABYTE phone?! i’ve had my XR since its release and i still have almost exactly half of its 64GB storage free 😂
FINALLY a 120hz iPhone. its about damn time
honestly, i don’t really understand the advantages of having a screen that NEVER turns off...i can think of a LOT more cons to that than pros
I think for a future the SE model should be the 5,4 inch that way they bring back a 5,8
Anything pop up on iphone 13 battery life?
Can you do a video on the 14" macbook and the 16" macbook release dates?
@everythingapplepro can you do a video about the issues iPhone 12 Pro Max costumers are having? Because I’ve been having this phone since January 15th and my screen keeps freezing almost everyday. I’ve been watching videos about other people having the exact same problem and it’s not the apps, it’s the phone. But ofc I won’t take it to apple because they’ll just tell me to buy a new one. There’s many other issues, hope you make a video
@everythingapplepro yo why you throw that nike beanie on like u got a paid promotion for it 😂😂I’m dead 💀 😂
iSheep
Hy I have been facing issues with the new 12 pro max microphone . It stop working for voice memo app, whatsaap voice memo , call on speaker and works fine for camera app and regular voice call. I have been looking for a fix and came to know on different forums that I m not the only one to face this issue and I have searched a lot on the youtube but no one has made the video about this issue . There isn’t any problem with app permission or anything I also reset all settings and no luck yet . Plz do make a video about this issue . This is so annoying.
I hope the new cooling means iPhones finally don't have to dim the display when they get warm, that's really annoying.
what does EAP mean
NIGHT MODE VIDEO on iphone!!!
Hi filip I’m a huge fan of your videos. I watch you here from the philippines. Currently i am studying online to continue my  education but my phone now is dead and broken i use iphone 6plus and i accendently drop it in the water 🥺🥺 please can i have one of your old phones i need to continue my education android or ios its fine 🥺 i am borrowing my fathers phone and should wait for him to go home before i can use his phone
Phonerebel shipping worldwide???
Idk why I'm watching this video. I don't have an iphone neither I'm planning on buying iphone 13.🙄
On my iPhone 6 patiently waiting for an iphone with a headphone jack, charging port and home button
Mashallah
Been watching for awhile , didn’t know why i haven’t subscribed yet lol
Anyone else still rocking a iPhone 4s??? 🤣
Great video quality - you’ve improved
Still rocking my iPhone 11 Pro Max. Waiting for the battery to go below 80% so apple care takes care of it.
Kira kira Realisnya kapan?
Portless iPhones? They are putting all the apples in the bucket with MagSafe but the charger has two flaws. 1 it’s slow 2 it gets extremely hot way to fast
Can you make crystal series 2 cases for iPhone 11 Pro Max?
And there's still that fucking notch
When is ur iPad video going to come out
Exact same case in India costs 2$..!
I saw u when u were young on the video of the first iphone......and today its very diffrent
Your a nerd but I like you and your reliable.
Hey all. Thanks for watching.  We used statistics to prove our point.  34% of people know that.
Can Chinese subtitles be added to each video in the future? But maybe this is impossible...
Probably it is time to switch to an iPhone - An Android User
Can I have a iPhone xs max and iPhone 12 pro max
What’s your perfect iPhone 12? You did a 7, an X, and an XS, you should do a 12 too.😅
How is the “new” apple car key feature different from the tesla app key i and most tesla users have enjoyed for 3+ years?
Whooopeeee! Always on display (might) be coming! Well done apple! Hopefully notch will dissappear in say a few years?
Please Fillip do more video we love u, and please if u can do a drop test for your own case
Any word on the battery life?
Port-less?  Hmmm, they better use a upgraded Bluetooth protocol.
I want a feature to allow you to record landscape video while holding the phone in portrait mode.  Do away with huge black squares on mobile recordings once and for all!  Just display a tiny widescreen preview at the top of your portrait-oriented iphone
Wait - I mean this in the most non-offensive way. You’re adorable. Lmao. Like in a baby picture way. I’m betting your baby pictures were precious too. Random, yes, because this is the first video of yours I’ve watched in a good 1-2 years. Your hairstyle was different too - this current style changes the shape of your face and ages you back. I think the last video of yours I watched was the one where you’re diving in the water with the iPhone (I forget if it’s an X or 8) inside a backpack or some type of bag to test water resistance.   Hope everything’s well, though!!!
14.2 jailbreak plz
I got the mi 11
So glad I didn’t get the 12! Come on 13!!
Why there’s no one talkng about the lens flare issues??? It’s soo annoying.
Awesome... I don’t want a port
Could you tell us the exact battery power
Any info on the new iPad Pro?
That Juventus jacket looking great, respect that drip 🔥💧
If its true, this might be the one I get. I skipped the 12 because it wasn't that exciting.
Good to see you back man.. ❤
Meh only gadgets. I will buy a new iPhone when they give us high refresh rates
Thanks Apple for giving me a solid reason to stick to my Iphone XS Max for yet another year. I can't believe it's the 5th year and the notch is still there and in general, nothing major has changed. Meh!
Max safe is garbage 😂😂😂😂
Want your cases in India But Shipping makes it much expensive
Is there any chance to increase a size of the battery ??
Waiting for iPhone 13, but i will not buy and then i'll wait for 14. 😁
I was waiting long time for apple to start making iphones with AOD, as this is the feature that I can not live without. Finally when they are about to do it, they want to get rid off the charging port, so I will not be able to use the apple car play (my car supports only cable connection). !"£$%^&*()!. I guess again I will have to stay with Macbook, Airpods and a Galaxy phone xD xD
How long does it take until apple build a smartphone, which charges with 120w, like with the Mi 10 Ultra? How long does it take until there are IPhones, wich have 16gb ram like the rog phone3? When will Apple build foldable smartphones? When will the pay-apps in appstore get as chea as in Android (now the same apps  cost nearly 3x on iPhone)? When will Apple build octa-core Smartphones, like all the other smartphone-companies? When will IPhones finally be able to zoom properly, like the P40Pro? When will in-display cameras and in display-fingerprint come? When does Apple finally come up with the idea of ​​fulfilling their cameras with reasonable megapixel values ​​and 8K video functions? The iPhone 13 pro max would have to come in the next 3 months and cost less than 1000 € in full equipment if Apple wants to be competitive again! And the SE3 would have to be under 100€, cause it is just as good as 100€ samsung A10! It will have an LCD🤣!  Even the Nokia N85 had an Oled! Every other smartphone companies sells cheap Oled-Smartphones, but Apple says: Premium-Feature🤣! Even when the IPhone 13 Pro Max would be under 200€, I wouldn't buy it, cause of the expensive apps! You don't seriously want to buy products from the most ridiculous company in the history of digitalization ?!
Apple pay more get less
HELLO BRO PLEASE GIVE ME MOBILE I WILL BEE VERY THANKFULL TO YOU PLEASE GIVE ME REPLY MAY GOD BLESS YOU THANK YOU
The abounding stem mathematically wriggle because married perioperaively offer between a permissible expansion. incandescent, gainful cello
And u cant transfer file to windows anymore?? Except buying mac book?
Why??where's the charging port..😭😭
I love stevejobs I love Apple 🍎
By when can we expect it in the market????
Good video. New reviewer looking for Sponsors for tek.
I won’t buy the iPhone 13 because i already have the iPhone 11 Pro Max and it’s still smooth, I might buy the iPhone 14 or 15 tho 😁
I can listen to his voice all day. 😂😁
I love iPhone 13❤️
Can you give me I phone 12👍👍🙏.
Anyone remember when Apple only released the "base iPhone" and the iPhone plus?
FUCK IPHONE 13!!! Cause we don't have money to buy these dang phone... Just older iPhones or new Samsung, or old Android phone.
Its looks cool.... but who cares it would be so expensive plus no charger with the phone😏
If port-less, how do I load all my photos and vids onto my computer?  I heard 240Hz, any truth to that?  Great vids!  I will be getting a 12S/13 for sure!  Oh, on the Tesla are you saying the U1 chip no longer uses bluetooth so that part that does not connect to the Tesla's sometimes would not happen ever?
everthing apple bs
I just need the touch id back then I will upgrade my 11 pro
It’s the same phone
Why does everyone take credit for cases made in china that they claim to be their own?
those cases are soooooo bulky and expensive.
when is the estimate date for the iphone 13 to come out
No fucking point to move on from the xs. Literally the best iPhone since. Until they get rid of the notch and bezel less screen. Then it’s time to upgrade, if you really feel like it.
I upgraded from my 7+ to a 12 Pro Max on day one. I planned on keeping this device another 4 years, but man, these leaks are already temping.  Glad you’re back making videos, man!
Wait he still makes these kind of vids? Would I be better off getting the iPhone 12 max or waiting for the 12s?
Can you please let Apple know to add power beats pro on the find my device cause I lost my case with the buds in it because of my baby brother and yea can’t find them, it could be use-full if they add that feature please let them know !
really no lightning port?
NO PORT IS STUPID! Just give us USB C
So. Many. Ads.
Sir I phone 13 pro max is nice
Can I please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please get a free IPhone 12 Pro Max
Ah jes... Always On Display.. looking at my moded Galaxy S2 and AOD Feature on it.
You’re so hot wtf
Woow thank god apple came up with the EXCLUSIVE new feature of Always on Display 😂😂😂
🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ 120 hz always on display portrait video?I hear it now oooo it's not how long it been out its who does it better 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣..just call it samsung iPhone.lmfao
I have iPhone 6 i hope to buy an iPhone 13 S
If we get 120hz I'll be moving back to Apple after many years on the other side.
If apple removes the lightning port then can only assume they are working on their own Wireless Carplay Adaptor
What the hell is an airtag good for? And why is everybody is so horny about it?
And...i don't feel excited at all for this upcoming iphone..😌 They took no time to remove  earphones jack, earphones..and then touch id.. now charger brick.. YET took like 3-4 years to remove those fugly notch..all they can do it to reduce the size which is still noticeable..

Hi I fell feel sorry for apple user because on Huawei they had periscope zoom since P30 model, also amoled screen since forever. Apple is barely bring this features in 2021 maybe for periscope camera and about amoled Is very recently they adopted and wait they still don't have always on display notifications and such. I switched from iPhone to Android only because I saw how much money I had to pay for an iPhone and the phone is much behind over the competition. You want more?How about refresh rate oh yes is still 60hz but wait now we catch up with 240hz because guess what?It's useless to have 240hz vs 90hz but they will ask more money and the battery will drain faster and the charger is not included. So I'm pretty sure I have so many reasons to stay away from iPhone.  :)) I hope more users will open their eyes and see how apple is making fun of their customers and in the same time they are ahead of competition only in the price range but not on features. So in the end I'm very satisfied by staying on Android because I can choose from so many different brands and features vs price.To be honest Huawei phones could be in top if not banned by USA.Now is Samsung but only because Huawei have big troubles. Otherwise Huawei it have been number one in top sales and features.
If iphone 13 still has a notch, Im switching to samsung 😬
Any leaks about the next airpods ?
I got the 12 Pro Max this year, waiting for the iPhone folding model now.
still I hope periscope is coming to the next iPhone!
My girlfriend got me an Apple watch as a gift.i was so excited..sadly I discovered that it was on iCloud lock..A friend recommended #kay_tools on IG and he unlocked it totally..nice job..

They need a better pricing on mini series.. I really want to buy the next one since I’m quite happy with my se 2020.
Pls 4 kamera on 8k pls
I got the 11 pro max not switching until like the iPhone 16
I am still in love with my 11 Pro Max. Nice screen size. Nice battery
Now I recognize that true and best vendor on here it’s legit I can say @Darklots on telegram you’re the best thanks I used the digital card it works really good,no blocking,the balance on it is even more than the actual balance I bought thanks to you @Darklots on Telegram❤️❤️
By iphone 20 we will have no power button and no volume button
I just ordered my rebel case for my 12 Pro Max. Can’t wait to get it.
what!!! iPhone 13 is coming out already wtf? i just bought the iPhone pro max. smh. should i return it and trade it for the 13.?
Like 🤙
Can i still buy  iphone xs max Brand new
Lol everything coming to the iphone has already been on most android for awhile now. Apple always so far behind but it's a status symbol to simple minded.
Ios users will be showing of AOD as if its a new feature..... 😂 😂
3:05 randomly puts his hat on 💁‍♂️
I can't afford apple products but I love it ❤️  One day I may have iPhone 😁😁
2016 Apple removes the head phone jack 2018 Apple removes the home button 2020 Apple removes the charger and headphones 2020 Apple also removes pace makers 2021 Apple removes the port
As a apple fan really hope there will be a 5x telephoto please🥺🥺🥺64MP isn’t that hard come on
iPhone 7 gang 💪
so nobody’s gona talk about him putting Nike over the adidas 🥴
Didnt the 12 pro just come out I got mine like when it dropped and I haven’t had this shit that long 😂
I hate my pro max 12 it sucks ass I regret this piece of dog crap
once apple removes the notch phones will be a really interesting thing, its hard to see how much better than can make a phone lookwise , a slab of glass with beautiful os, they can focus on battery and screen technology, i feel like they give the camera too much attention most people are not models, Who is really taking pictures of everything in their life, its nice but lets focus more on screen technology
Plot twist: Tom Holland’s brother works at apple.
Apple skipped over the iPhone 9
Literally everyone: REMOVE THE NOTCH NOT THE PORT!  apple: y'all hear somefine?
Apple will do anything to avoid USB C on the iPhone eh LOL
They remove the charging port to force people buy MagSafe to get more money! That is apple, *create the problem sell the solution* .
It's a travesty that the iphone 12 is 60hz..
Am I the only one that noticed the fact that he randomly put a Nike beanie on his head in the middle of the video???
Didn’t a phone just come out?
I have 11 pro I’ll probably wait till the notch is completely gone
I'm so tired of this consumerism, couldn't they just have added all of that this year? If cellphone companies were really eco friendly and all that, couln't they just release a new phone every other year? And the worst part is that we have allowed that to happen.
Notice the ones who can’t afford the new iPhones are kids 😂😂 ya’ll should be grateful you even have an iPhone. I got my first flip phone in 8th grade. back when iPhones we’re bearly coming out
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RoBBON_Bb8M
I need the mini with Touch ID, Apple need to put to work.
I upgrade this year in December so I’m back to watching these videos all year 🙌🏾 Got the 11 Pro Max space Grey 👌🏾 Hoping to get blue or more space Grey , n pay for the phone outright
Good because I LOVE my 12 mini.  LOVE IT!!!!!
Why are you not modding iPhones anymore? Why are you’re videos so far apart now? You used to be cool, now only here and there wish I’d never subscribed
Hopefully they manage to get the cameras down to just one camera will all the tech of having what looks like 4 that would be amazing not sure how they’ll do it tho
What apple should do is allow people to buy custom iPhones directly on their site

Hello guys
Disappointing, they keep on keeping the good stuff for later. Then the year after that they say nah it’s not happening now.
What will happen to wired CarPlay, if there's no port anylonger?
Focus live app is doing portrait video currently with all multicamera iOS phones and iPhone12 with Lidar. It does post processing on video and does a pretty ggod job.
Usb killer on kyocera duraforce pro 2
They should make magsafe charge faster in the iPhone 13.
How much the iPhone 13 cost price
Gonna buy iphone 13 for sure🧲😉
Will it milk my cow?
i wish they could just call it iphone S
Thank you for the Proser summary - your videos are so much more relaxing and enjoyable to watch 😁
me watching with my iphone 12 👁👄👁
iPhone 13 with out Lightening port  iPhone 14 with out battery 🔋  iPhone 15 with out Display  iPhone 16 with out Mother board  . . . iPhone 25 we have to assemble all parts at home....
omg, are you sponsored by nike?
It’s about time we have always on display and smaller notch, Apple does seem behind others with periscope zoom etc, however, it’s better to wait and get it right because the present day 100X zooms, are rubbish and unusable in my opinion. I’m looking forward to 13 Pro Max later this year, I have 12 Pro Max at present and pretty pleased, but I upgrade yearly. Thanks for this from the UK 🇬🇧
It’s fake
Copied from samsung
Starting early is the best way of getting ahead to build wealth, investing remains a priority. The stock market has plenty of opportunities to earn a decent payouts, with the right skills and proper understanding of how the market works
Months ago I heard that the iPhone 12 mini was going to be the best selling iPhone! Say that again
Watching this on my galaxy s21 ultra lol
This time no box 📦 phone will be dropped from the sky !
Is it that difficult to get rid of the notch 🤦‍♂️ apple are the biggest scammers out there
A less tall notch is way better than a less wide option in terms of aesthetic, if Apple cannot remove it from this year's iPhone
Typical apple, release a always on display but then say notifications won't remain on that !, What is the point in that !, The whole point of the always on display is so you can see notifications and not have to keep activating the phone to see if you have missed anything !. Surely this cannot be their solution! 🙄🙄
120 Hz display! Now it's time to get iPhone
Jeeeeezus... already an iPhone 13? All the freaking iPhone 12 versions JUST came out.  I swear... I can never and will never be able to catch up. I just upgraded from a 6plus to an XS Max (for $550) and I feel sooo out of date now. Smh 🤦🏻‍♀️ hate it.
Give me
the optical sensor on my OnePlus 7 pro leave after image that you can see on white backgrounds, I think it's an oled burn-in, I hope apple can find a solution for that if they're using it.
I am either sticking to my 11 pro max till 2022, or switching to android. I want better zoom capabilities, brighter screen, and 120 hz refresh rate or higher! Hoping that Apple won’t let me wait till 2030 though ...!
Wireless charging, more like portless charging. The Magsafe still has a cable so the meaning is completely gone
Fuck iPhone 13 Just i have 12
"Very minimal customization" From Apple? Stop the presses! 😱
Bro I wanted to order rebel case but there is no shipping option to India 🇮🇳 ???can u please sort it out for me ??!
13 is unlucky,they'll name it 20 or something
I just bought the 12 pro max smh damm Apple 😒
They better make the always on display possible for the latest models too...
Now apple road to launch a new iPhone And I am waiting for my first apple phone😀
I still haven't had my iPhone 12 yet and now they're focusing on iPhone 13??!
Also they need atleast a 10x optical zoom they are seriously behind with that I wanted this for years now
I will not upgrade from my 10s until they get rid of that horrible notch worse thing on a phone period , Touch ID in screen would be way better and just a cut out for the camera just make even more money if they finally did that alone
They skipped the 11s to avoid legal confusion with Nike Jordan 11s 🤔💭🧠🤯
waiting for iphone 15..still happy with my iphone XR 😉
iphone 13 3camera ok ,👌👍
ㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤ
Apple stay releasing "new features" Samsung had for YEARS now.
tesla is kinda late to the party, mercades has been doing that for a few years now.
Some Nike ads?
I've had "always on" on my pixel for the longest time. But I'm excited to see what apple comes up with in the future.
Dude I just got the 12 and now I’m like the 13 is so much better
Can you tell me about Blackberry phone coming....😍😍😍
iPhone 13 coming soon I want that phone
When is gonna ipad mini 6 release
If always on was confirmed will iphone 13 come with 120Hz too?
lets address the issue with the current iPhone 12 Pro Max terrible Macro capture capability ... my iphone 6s plus takes better macro shots... ...
I can unlock, lock, start, roll windows up and down with my phone now. You do have to buy a Clifford ds4 alarm/security system to do that though.
Goddamnit I just bought the iPhone 12 promax screw it man I’m not buying any more iPhones I have every generation iPhone up to the iPhone 12 Pro Max I’m gonna wait till the iPhone 1000 comes out before I buy another iPhone
Damm the 13 already ? Fuck just wait until the 16 comes out lol
Start talking about 240FPS slo-mo video in 4K
Okay but... will i be able to use my iPhone 12 pro max cases with the 13 Plus?
Why the rebel case isn’t available in  Mexico!?😟
2:43 that’s what she said
Ayoooo hold up hold up! I literally just bought an iPhone 12 Pro Max
You look sickly!
Bruh already??-
Be back...those donuts made me want some snacks
If they remove the charge port I will cry
If they go port-less then those speakers better be amazing
If they remove the charging port, I’m done with them. This wireless charging is not so environment friendly, because it consumes energy like crazy for doing the same job and is also uncomfortable for the user ...
WTH I JUST BOUGHT THE 12 PRO
I don’t like #13. So I’m good with my 12. I will wait for the 14 😁
Urgh. I've been selling these 12's at my retailer and they just kind of suck. It's like, please innovate, apple. Do more than half of what samsung does and you'll be amazing.
Worst video you talking to much about iPhone 12 pro only
The ugly turtle finally scratch because mint july fear throughout a maddening revolver. ill-informed, difficult underpants
Waiting for the 14❤️
I've been seriously tempted by the 12 Pro Max but ended up sticking with android and buying the S21 Ultra.  If the 13 has a 120hz refresh, I might finally make the jump to iPhone.
Need a new jail break for iOS 14 or a new joy stick for Pokémon go. Be a champ pls
If charging port removed what will solve problem with Apple car play because that requires wired connection
I always wanted iPhone 12 pro but its too expensive :/
You can already unlock a Tesla with your iPhone. I have a Tesla and the iPhone 11

What about apple titan concept is it true?
I just buy the 11pro and the iPhone 13 come out 😬
Since iPhoneX, I told myself that I would finally try an iPhone when it one day comes with a USB-C port. Seems like that day might never come...
Basically *all* these feature have been on Samsung phones for years...  It's also good to see apple getting rid of the charging cable, considering they still can't make one with any longevity.
Just. Get. Rid. Of. The. Fucking. Notch  Thats all I want man. I left iphone cuz OnePlus was doing high refresh rate full screen displays with great software and widgets. Id like to come back to iphone but they need a better viewing experience.
Wth wow it was only yesterday the iPhone 12 came out and now this already !
Waiting for iPhone B
It’s gonna be the same thing huh? Frick
AIR AIR AIR AIR everything is AIR, Apple thinks they r Nike or somethin?
NO charging port is such a deal breaker :(
7:04 you can already open your Tesla with your phone 🤔
iPhone gonna jump from IPhone 6 to IPhone 13. So excited
iphone notch🤦🏼‍♂️😩
You guys really ruin the fun of using the crrent phone.
U mean Samsung Pro🤣
Optical finger print sensor gonna be revolutionary... Can't wait to see
Please give me a iPhone
Hmko dedo iphone please
12s makes sense  (re design, s year, design refresh)
I don’t feel excited about iphone leaks anymore. It’s more or less the same old thing they keep releasing by giving it a new name. Nothing special but yeah extra grands to spend so that you can flex
Still rocking with my iPhone 7 Plus. I’ve been available for an upgrade since the iPhone 11 but non of the features are exiting me I think the 13 might finally get me to upgrade.
Didnt the 12 just come out g, take a break essay I’m still tryna catch up with 2016
are you thinner?
Watching this on my iphone 5🤣😅😂😞😞
Always on display samsung always had it 😂 iphone is always so boring 😭
The original iPhone 13 and Mini will have three cameras while the 13 Pro and Pro Max will have four cameras.
You guys should just grab a Samsung to get all these features years before. Can already reverse wireless charge... and can charge another phone if you want. Already had 120hz for years, already had always on display for years. Already had under screen fingerprint reader for years. The galaxy s21 also can take pics of the moon already. But if you want to be with the phone company that's only 1st to remove a feature.. be my guest
I definitely don't want a portles phone
Why is there so many commercials watching such a short clip ?
If Apple goes ahead with the moronic port removal , no more iPhones  for this  little black duck.
Believe it when I see it those tags been delayed long enough
iPhone 7: no headphone jack iPhone X: no home button iPhone Xs: no difference iPhone 11: no 3D touch iPhone 12: no charger iPhone 13: no charging port
But is it going to come in midnight green though?
I went to buy rebel case but I am Indian...  How can I do that?
Samsung already done everything
Hshdhhsh
Anyone waiting for iPhone 69?
the only reason I haven't switched my old-ass iphone 6s to a 12 is because it doesn't have touch-id. no touch id is a deal breaker for me.
I need a new Apple Watch —— my first gen battery is dieding
I find the 12 Mini should have replace the SE series instead.
Sounds like a nightmare. There’s little worse than stray LED lights for sapping your deep sleep without you even realising. I found every one in my sleeping room and neutralised them and it surprisingly improved my restedness dramatically. Now we have a phone with an always on display and you have to charge it in an open space with a charging pad or something you can’t even hide it under the bed. Big brother can’t leave us alone for one minute
if there was time stamps in your video it would be greatly appreciated
I am keeping my 12 perfect, so I can sell it and buy 13. I just pray battery is good for the first 120hz model.
How will this work for apple carplay ? Since there won’t be a charging port?
7:51 “alsoe” what a cool voice crack (Edit) yes I know their normal but some are cool
Ay don’t make me sad I got the 12 pro max
Oh yeah definitely gonna wait for the 13!
What's with that "hat move"?      Had to stop watching.
Finally a portless iPhone.. cant wait. :) :) :)
Always on display? we have that 5 years already.
They should fix the hitting issues
Waiting for a better iphone 13 mini ❤️
Can Someone tell me What is that green dot on video when you video record with iPhone?
I have a good idea about Magsafe. Why don’t Apple do it like those magnetic charging cable where the tips is removable and the cable just magnetic to that to charge the phone? Also I really love the Rebel case except there is a cut out where all the buttons. I do ‘t like that..why don’t you make it solid like the clear version? For that reason, I’m hesitate to buy 🥲
There's barely innovations on phones, the only differences is the design.
Always On Display Hahahha I Have It On My Stone age J7 Pro Why Apple is Always Late On Everything
If iphone features portless I can see the sales decline and market share drop significantly
So what happens with CarPlay and no port?  New car or some crap quality Bluetooth add on.
1:56 samsung mobile already have always on display feature and 120 hz hahahah
Soooo, it's like a S20 Ultra... from last year....
Guess I ll have to use my old iphone till it dies. Wont be buying anyphone without charging port. I’d rather buy mid segment android.
Most ‘desperately’ needed genuine advancement for the next iPhone is, 1). Solid State Battery and 2). microLED Display (micro not mini, there’s a huge difference). These two things alone should have been well in the pipeline by now, but as usual the other manufactures will be releasing this first as such their always on display which has been out for years.
So, we all gonna wait for 2022 then? This year's release seems very uninteresting.
Me waiting for iPhone 13 so I can buy used iPhone 11 at a cheaper price 🤘🏻😁
Any update on the gen 2 frosted series?
Me: debating if I should upgrade my dying iPhone 7 and get the iPhone 12 now or wait until the 12s(13) and risk the charging port
Can gift me iphone for my online class.
I am not that much rich to buy iPhone but i have old iPhone 6
I would way rather have a charging port I could actually careless about the Bessels like this comment if you agree or kind of agree.
my phone rebel gen 1 clear and frosted not yet arrive for 1 month already=(
Still dreaming i phone haha never touch before iphone 🤤🤤
Love From India-Gujarat-Jamnagar-Dhrol-Nana Vagudad Village ❤️
Me watching from my iPhone 5.  👁️ 👃 👁️       👄
Can’t wait for the iPhone 13.
What are air tags????
Got the iPhone 12 with Magsafe accessories! Hoping iPhone 14 will be a bigger upgrade in 2022
I got the first gen frosted Series and it’s great! I’ve been loving it, protected my phone from all the drops I’ve run into and the fact that it came with a screen protector is a nice feature!
waiting for iphone 13 mini
I didn’t even get iPhone 12 now they coming up with 13 fuck
They will not call it iPhone 13 Maybe 12s or 14  Pin 📌
wym portless, I use my phone when it’s charging all the time wtf
There won't actually be an iPhone "13"  so I'm wondering what it will actually be called.. maybe iPhone 2021 (or 21)... I don't think Apple will just skip 13 and go to 14 like they did with the 9.  Also the always-on screen rumor, if true, will probably implemented with mandatory accelerometer trigger like it was implemented on the Apple Watch.   It won't be truly always on because OLED simply cannot handle persisted static on-screen elements without burn in.  Samsung's OLED tech suffers from this, and AFAIK they produce the oled panels for Apple.  Its possible of course that there have been some improvements to OLED tech but my guess is they're going to have some sort of work-around for the potential burn-in problem.
I have the iPhone 12 Pro Max silver- and if they remove the port of the iPhone 13. Then I’m not upgrading
The alike faucet presently impress because purchase complimentarily arrive off a real craftsman. limping, blushing tractor
Me with the iphone 12 pro max 😂
Are you also making the rebel series case for 10x max
Camera looks like samsungs 20 series
You can never have the latest iPhone Apple always bring another one right after you purchased it like damn it’ll be $2000 and up cell phone give it a break please for at least two years and more smh
samsung note10 lite also have the all black camera alrd
Where is iPhone 20
Is the Iphone 13 has thinner notch ?
Hey I wanted to know if u could help me find away how to get games free e.g CoD ,SF5 those types of games onto my MacBook Air 2020
I’m hoping for power share bruh
iPhone 12 was a total failure
Waiting for iPhone 13
Apple should put a micro sd card slot to replace the lightning port
Battery sharing ?
Bro I just got the pro max now another one is out screw this
Won’t be getting it if it’s portless Fuck that!
I'm waiting for iPhone 20 before end of this year
Sticking with my Xs Max till the notch disappears because they just keep shrinking it every year.
Ok pixel 4 camera on iPhone got it
I would be happy with no notch whatever it takes, I would go from my 12 pro max to a se plus just for no notch...
When will apple finally release the nothless phone?? iPhone x is my daily driver, and i won't upgrade until the notch gets removed 🙈
Still on the iPhone 7 going 💪. 😖🤧
I was saving up money for the 12 Pro Max but I think I’ll just wait for the 13. What really made me want to wait is the Touch ID. If apple brings that back that would be amazing ! Especially since we’re in a pandemic and have to wear masks. You have to put your passcode/password in every time you wanna use your phone
lmao 😂😂😂💀💀💀
Can’t wait to see a case test drop with your new redesign cases! Use the iPhone pro max size!
No macro lense?
Wow this is amazing I can’t wait
The  titanium iPhone will look so awesome 👏 and probably expensive as well.
Realista , o cara não descartou a hipótese de eles continuarem com a hipótese
I'm disappointed that Apple is not changing a lot to the iPhone 13, If they are going to make it identical to the iPhone 12, I'll rather just buy the 12 and not wait for the 13, it's not worth it waiting for the 13 if they are not going to change a lot. That's my opinion.
If Touch ID returns to iPhone I'll return with it.
I want usb c
Me: Poor EAP: Rich even with just iPhones.
Apple is far behind samsung
Lmao why does he have a cheese grater on his desk😂
I really need the TouchID back.... C'mon apple
Lol iphone is becoming android. At some point all phones will become so similar they will be the same thing.
It’s makes the phone looks too thick with those cases , make them more nude thin
Bro iPhone 12 busts came out
When will iphone 9 launch???
Lol iphone finally getting android features.
apple needs to start taking there time right now we have so many iphones we don’t need them every single year i think everybody can agree we would rather see something new than another iphone x.  and they need to quit removing shit. smh. 🤦🏿
After being an iPhone user for more than 6 years ... if they Take out the charging port imma move to samsung ... sorry not sorry
Let me save you some time here ..  BASICALLY IS THE SAME EXPECT PHONE  just like every single year 🤣     and they "adding new tech" that Android/Samsung had years ago !
No one cares about the people in Europe wether we prefer an iPhone with USB port or no. SHAME ON YOU APPLE! When you sell your products, consider the fact that not only USA uses your products.
Please not portless
I hope they add always on display on the old iPhones with OLED displays. So  it can be an iOS 15 thing more than a iPhone 13 thing
Why it looks like Pixel 5
if port less  happens to the iPhone how would the ones still using windows iTunes sync there phone, would there be wireless data transferring, also how would carplay work for cars that do not offer wireless carplay
Omfg the iphone 12 just came out
13 is a bad number. Don’t buy it.
iPhone 12 so ugly
Apple is honestly just a joke at this point...
Already waiting on iPhone 14 😌 Just asking can we lock messages and photos geez!!!!   key  feature “mag safe is stronger”  I’m calling it now!!!
Lol Apple finally gets always on display on iPhones. That took almost a decade.
how can I even stream mobile games using an elgato if I'm planning to get an iPhone 13 pro max this year. :(
No charging port? They're really going for that Pro video & photography... So how am I supposed to transfer those large video files to my Mac? Okay, cloud storage and airdrop, but those are not the best for this usage.
Nice Hair bro
All I care about is that the best camera not be only available in the ridiculous, giant "max" phone. I would have bought a 12 Pro had the camera not been crippled. Won't ever buy a "max."
I knew the would release a titanium iPhone
Imagine using the back tap feature to unlock your car. That would be so cool.
WOW! looks so different from the old one! They did so much design!!!!!!!! OMGGGGGGG
3:00 you can't tell me that isn't product placement
Anyone else hear the voice crack at 7:51 when he says “also”? Lol
#MobilEOn #SeeBeyond 👌
sir can you bring ipad pro 2021 version leakes
#MobilEOn #SeeBeyond 👌
I want 13 not an “s”!
I did not care about the headphone jack or the home button. I do however care about a charging port and I will rather buy last years phone than having no charging port.
A port less iPhone is stupid
Hopefully the iPhone 13 will not have a brick form like the iPhone 12
Hell nah they needa fix the iPhone 12 I have the 12p and it has hella bugs and glitches they pushed this phone to quickly
Portless is fucked up. If they are portless I can't charge my phone on the go unless I take the magsafe charger with me and all my old chargers, lightning cables are all wasted now. FUck apple
i dont want my iphone 12 pro anymore .. LMOA
watching on my Iphone 12 Pro 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👊🏻
Is always on display iOS 15 or only iPhone 13 pro feature?
Imagine a macbook without cpu with a hole where the trackpad is located, in the hole is magsafe. Simply put yout magsafe iphone in and it transforms to a trackpad and starts to be the processor with macOS 😍😍😍
Gonna be switching to Samsung
If the display comes with more HZ i will buy the next IPhone
more overpriced crap from apple🤣🤣🤣
Yo chill iphone 12 just got released-
No Originality, Retro IPhone Design, Steve Jobs Rolling Over in his Grave
Cmon brooo i just upgraded to 12 😭😭
Hey, Faw here, I just wanted to ask whether can you help.  Lemme tell you my sad story,  I have iPhone 6 and it is stuck on 12.5.1! and  I need ios 13/14 on my device without jailbreak.  Is it Possible?
I like red
You understand that Tim Cooke is laughing his ass off at this? Also 2019 apple was reported saying they wouldn’t remove the lightning port because doing so would create even MORE electronic waste. Also people still need to connect to a PC. there is no Airdrop for PC so the lightning port will not be going anywhere. Apple has even said themselves, that have zero plans to remove the lightning port because of the electronic waste. Stop making these renders showing iPhone without one. It’s a lie, it WILL have a lightning port. Mark my words
Are you not making Gen 2 crystal series for 11 pro max?
Same thing different year
Still learning all the things my iPhone 11 does...
MKBHD is watching this video on iPhone 13.  I am serious
Mfs really in comments defending Apple for dear life. Like do they pay y’all 🤔😂
Can I get 90 fps in pubg?
Always on Display, same as Android, nothing new here.
I'll give my mother an iPhone one day Insaallah.❤️❤️
Thank God. I didn't buy the 12 mini because there is no fingerprint scanner. Still using my 2014 SE without a functioning camera!
Always on Display.... I'm sure Samsung will copy that feature....    /s
Always on display,,, finally !!!!!!!!!!!! Portrait video,,,, finally !!!!!!
If they go portless they’ll have many Apple CarPlay user very frustrated! Me included
they removed the home button they removed the headphone Jack they are gonna remove the notch they are removing the charging port what’s next the screen
How can i get iphone 12 promax
i have 12 basic here please don’t make me feel bad
No charging ports? Thanks no, dont need a real bomb in my house. Wireless charging is just really bad for the battery!
Already
iPhone letting people down selling us the same shit over and over take a break at least!
Love the Apple content, but can we take a second to talk about the Nike hat and Adidas shirt...
I might get the 13 Pro Max. Idk yet. 🤷🏿‍♂️👌🏾😎☝🏾
Micro SD card support????? Pls?
For real kinda no big difference
iPhone come quick
I love mini I just don’t like that it doesn’t have better camera….
They look the same every year Samsung been changing the game with different styles of looks and better quality phones  just letting it out there. Peace ✌
I apologise for saying this but: Always on display, portrait video, reverse wireless charging etc has been on samsung for a couple of years now so they can’t say that it is innovative.  BUT  before you comment I don’t care whether its a IPhone, Samsung, Nokia, or blackberry. It’s just a phone.
It's so cool how technology has evolved.
The top tier iPhone 13 will be iPhone 13 S pro H T max XL Y Plus
So what’s the deal with the touque? Is your studio that cold?or are you silently plugging Nike too?🤔😆
I mean ......ik u r excited but 12 released 3 months ago🤣🤣
2:15 .Am i the only one that realised that the time on the phone in the middle wasn't the correct time apple uses for every showcase, and the date was Friday the 13th? 😂
A port less iPhone would be cool but if Apple goes ahead with it they should include a MagSafe charger in the box or else we would have to buy the power brick as well as the MagSafe component.   Also if Apple is thinking to go with an optical under screen fingerprint sensor isn't that less secure and can easily be fooled? As we all know Apple cares about privacy and security and they may likely choose to go with optical and I hope that isn't the case. In my opinion I rather have it be less reliable than having zero security at all.
Why would they remove wire charging?
Bro give me only one I phone please I m not touch I phone please bro one iphone please 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Iphone 13 : no charging port Iphone 14 : no speaker  Iphone 15 : no phone( only box )  Iphone 16 : no box  Iphone 17 : no earth
They should add an Always On Display on iOS, it will be helpful, especially at night time. That’s what I’ve missed from my Galaxy S10
So when is Tech people gonna talk about the iMac redesign?
feeling bad for mobile gamers who were using elgato to stream
meh i might buy iphone 12 pro max maby   idk prob smsung s22 u lltra lads
with every leak and update my major concern is only with the batt life. Apple can't really compete with batt life with android...
I heard that next IPhone's will be 12s
So no port is a PRO feature...
And cars in the future will have wireless charging pads guys. It will happen.
it got cold mid video lol
I'm up for portless with my mag safe on the 12 pro I have not plugged in my charger once.
I just got my iPhone 12 wtf 13 already
really ??? just few month from 12 , so fast u want to leak ???
All I care about is the front display. Faster refresh. No notch. Little/no border. Camera is already good enough, speed is already good enough. I use a case so don't care about the back of the phone. Apple needs to fix the front display. No notch and faster refresh. Just my opinion
Android manufacturers: In 5 years we’ll have floating, folding, virtual phones   Apple in 5 years: We did it guys, We Shrunk the notch!
my dream phone
Still got the 11 Pro Maxx and gonna keep it till the iPhone 13. No phone rebel 2 case for previous gen iPhones? Love my series one but keep cracking the screen protector since it doesn’t cover the sides and always hits just right 😢.
How will portless phones work with CarPlay in our vehicles?  Can the MagSafe/USB charging cords do data transfer?  I love the idea of no ports but not at the expense of losing my CarPlay abilities.
I am just buying if it goes portless
I need that case🔥
features that apple won't be taking into consideration until the company shuts down
With all these features, been personally waiting for (portless, AO display, smaller notch, 120 hz) it does not feel like an S cycle, would prefer it called 13
I just can’t see Apple going from an update like iOS 14.5 where you can unlock your iPhone with your Apple Watch ⌚️ ($200 plus dollar problem to have) to you don’t need an Apple Watch to unlock your iPhone. That doesn’t make all the sense in the world: it would behoove them if you have a problem with mask wearing 😷 in this pandemic we have a $200 plus dollar solution if you buy this Apple Watch ⌚️ Vs. you don’t need an Apple Watch to unlock your iPhone because we have a fingerprint reader with TouchID features. Personally, the average consumer that buys Apple products will forget the fact that FaceID is a problem when they buy an Apple Watch ⌚️ with iOS 14.5 and watchOS 7.4 update. In addition, I will make a bet that as soon as that updates happen for both the iPhone and Apple watch ⌚️ those rumors of a fingerprint scanner in the display will drown out physiological noise out and we won’t be talking about it.  Everything Apple Pro keep up the good work. Have the best renders in the biz.
What about the battery 🔋 sizes and battery 🔋 life
Dual sim?
11 pro owner already hyped for the iphone 14 or 15
That black flush lens on the cameras looks sick. No round lens sticking out
How do Apple get their screens/displays from Samsung, who got rid of their notch but Apple can’t? The idea of no notch is the only exciting thing about a new phone at this point... as much as I’m an Apple user and always have been they’re sinking ship fast
What about portable chargers (will it just be like the normal wireless charger, but then how do you charge the charger (will it be usb type c or the one they normally use) and then what’s the point in taking out the charging port if we need the charger anyway to charge the charger??
need charger and earphones  output of the box
Have the phone colors been announced or leaked
give me an iphone bro
think apple will the the price to the peak in india
Excited for the next phone but definitely won’t be getting it 😂 I just upgraded from an XS Max to a 12Pro Max and loving it🥰, BUT I love these types of videos fr💯💯
Dang! I viewed 4 Samsung ads plus 1 non skippable Samsung advertisement on an iPhone leaks video.
Waiting for iphone 20♥️
Ugh. Just ditch the S line. It’s so much easier to just keep the numbers going. And also, im not sure how excited I am for port-less. It’s nice to have a secure charging connection. Maybe the “stringer magnets” will help.
About time iPhone had always on display, Samsung had it for years now ever since the galaxy s6 I think?
Nike beanie with Adidas sweater , whattttt
Samsung did it 👨‍🦯
I will never understand why some comments in phone videos are violent 💀
*looks like they will still have that horrible huge notch then...* like seriously??? 🤷🤷🤷
Wow Can't afford it though
Dude this samsung ad right before video...!
mmm nothing really exciting.
I prefer Xiaomi 😌 The most advance phone brand 😌 I phone 12 release and a months after Xiaomi give a speech that they're working on air charging ✌️ I like the design of them especially the Xiaomi mi mix alpha that really got me 😁
how do i transfer my videos for editing on pc if there's no port.. damn it apple :/
is this 2021 iphone leaks or 2022
Can you please do a tutorial on how to unlock a locked iCloud on iphone if you forgot the password 🙏
After upgrading from 7 Plus to 12 Pro Max there is only one thing that really bothers me - ITS WEIGHT!! it's too goddamn heavy! I have big hands and I don't have any issue operating it with one hand but do get fatigue quite fast. Not gonna upgrade to any Plus model until they slim & reduce the weight, on this "brick"...
hi ! sorry I'm just at 3;27, watching 12 pro max and S21 ultra .. what is that shit over there ? I mean, is that really the S21 Ultra ? wow I'm so disappointed  ... well I guess that he has other things to offer  but wow ... so low quality
I just wanna know. What colour for the next iPhone 13 pro or 12s will get.
I watch it but can't buy 🙄 Apple 12pro is1,50,000 rs in india😭
Yang dari indo satu server Coy
I love the fact that everytime apple shows a 'completely new' feature, it has been there with samsung a few years long
When it comes to the markets
What about iPad mini with pencil support ?  Throw in a good cam and internals to compete the Galaxy note series .
gaandoo
Idk why I'm watching this I can't even afford iphone 6 😂 forever vivo 😂😂😂
chudelke
tere baap ke had
Stronger MagSafe? So even worse for people with heart devices? Great!
Waiting for iphone 20 to get 12 pro
Fun fact: Everyone is getting annoying samsung ads rn.
Your audio quality sucks.
About your cases, why didn't you make the gen 1 cases for the iPhone 12?
Eh.
I love and hate how serious he is in these videos. Come on crack a joke papi
😍
❤️
All i want is usb c..
Why U put the hat on😁
still have my 11, not updating until they go notchless
What if there’s a port less phone’s, then will there be the cheap MagSafe included in the box like the apple watch has it’s own MagSafe thing.
Can't wait....
Samaung is better lol
These phones are coming out so fast. Can’t keep up. Lol
Does apple even listen to the feedback of customers. Customers want a better battery, they make the battery more smaller🙄 Can't understand why they don't give customers what they really want in a camera like for Samsung. So stuck up!!
12 is too much of a change from 11 to be 11s. Body shell changed significantly
iPhone 13 SE iPhone 13 mini iPhone 13  iPhone 13 max iPhone 13 Pro mini iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 13 Pro max
No ports on iPhone will just make me not get iPhone no more. Just becoming more of an inconvenience where you can do less and less for more and more. I don’t need portable social media or for whatever other reasons why we buy these devices anyways. All that stuff can wait till I get back to my desktop/tablet, I just need device for google maps and I’m good.
Noooo i want the charging port i don't like airpods they cause cancer
I’ll wait until that notch goes. I hate it.
So I think this is the iPhone that takes me from my 11 Pro Max
Why would they not take advantage of the always on display, how about more useful information like something as basic as showing the weather. I love the optimization of iPhone but oversights like this make me want to move to android...it’s just ridiculous at this point to wait another year for these kinds of things!
hoping for notchless.... wont hold my breath tho
does apple allow leaks or not also when do u think its the realease date & prices because im gonna be a freshman in college in fall, need the iphone 12s or 13 pro max 190 hz 90 fps bc i want to be a proffesional gamer streamer on nmobile and pc hopefully. love ur vids btw
iphone 15 will be just full of camera in the top
Sideways Face ID on iPad but not iPhone hmm and more angles would be nice
Need that airpods wireless charging feature
5 ads + what ever that was in the beginning just to hear about leaks... That’s kind of scummy compared to other videos that only have 2
LMAOO that voicecrack at 7:51
Nice wig
A Samsung Galaxy Ad before an Apple video Lol
Apple will always be 10 years behind lol
I want the Mini but idk if I should wait for the 13! 😩😩😩
You are vere level man
can u make a video on air-pods pro 2 and when is its launch ?
Please  i am refuge  from kenya  please help me with cheap phone
What will be the "Hero" color of that series 🧐
13 or 12S(successor) of 12 series will be great🙌🏻🤩
Please don’t no port, because no port can’t connect to elgato😩
When will do you gen-2 case drop test?
Ive had my iPhone 7 Plus for 4 years now. I’ve only used the port for charging, never had a serious software issue that a restart couldn’t fix. I’m all good for a port less iPhone.
iphone 13 is gonna release in april/ march?
Apple catching up
5% share for the iPhone 12 Mini is still a literal fuckton of phones...
I herd you all got dumped with snow down there! Not so much in Bellingham but still enjoyable!!
I wonder who inspired the AOD, and the vapor cooling chamber?  - Note 10+ User
Awesome content and great shots!
I will not go port-less.
Fascinating!
Your visuals are amazing!
need help,, do i go for iphone13 or wait for iphone14??
Next iPhone 14 "4 camera" "small camera bezel" XDDD
I'm waiting for iphone 100.
I think the pro models should get usb-c and better mag safe, if your buying a pro phone you will have a usb-c cable
Thanks for sharing this amazing video with us all
6S still the heavyweight iPhone champ- 5.5 years later. Get one before they’re gone for good. Last “true” iPhone before the lies.
#peace
Who got samsung ad in beginning of the video??
👌
Please show your Audi R8
I just got your phone rebel series 1 crystal and i am in love with it. Alot better than my old crappy phone case with a plastic excuse for a screen protector
When iphone is in my own budget i will buy iPhone 17
😁😂😁https://youtu.be/Tl-Wou65yYQ
has there been any updates on the iMac redesign?
I am waiting for the 13 Mini
Need 120hz display, smaller notch and under screen fingerprint scanner to warrant an upgrade from 8+. I hope to upgrade this year.
Hey EAP I was wondering if u could add time stamps in your videos
someone please give some advice to the isheeps to not support apple, they're taking too much advantage of them lol
They skipped 11S because of the re-design and 5G.
If the cameras are going to be the same, what will be the differences between the 13 pro and 13 pro Max?
camera looks clean
The no charging port idea is really stupid 😂
Watching this on my iPhone 12 mini. I couldn’t be happier with this phone.
I feel like this is the iPhone people have been waiting for the last few years.
Phone rebel is not deliverable to India
What gonna happen wen the runner of apple  died
Thanks for the video...  Not sure why you have to sneak ads in like Nike, come on , isn’t the youtube monetization paying enough?
Accident design, the best of American Art. Lol
So basically, same old, just higher price ... would apple ever really innovate and create something amazing? First iphone amazing
So were is the updates on technology?
I would prefer iPhone 13 instead of 12s
They skipped 11s because it will be mouthful. 11 is already 3 syllables lol. Ten and twelve are just one syllable so hahahhaha
Waiting for iphone 31 🤩😎👌✨⚡️
How many subscribers do u have from 🇳🇵 Nepal
Is Nike sponsoring you?
Why are you so hot?!
Why does everyone use the same flawed terminology of saying the notch is slightly less taller??!!  Just say it’s shorter!
“Always on” **incoming oled burn in**
Next, John Prosser says
I’m currently waiting on the iPhone 13 I currently have the iPhone xr since 2019 and I have the iPhone seven but I can’t wait for you to do a video on it when it drops
So buying an iPhone 13 mini! 🥰
Make cases for iPhone 8 Plus and with belt clips
Y’all know know damn well apple ain’t bout to put all that into one upgrade year. We’ll get one of those features. Probably the 120ghz. Other than that it’ll be camera upgrades and maybe a stronger magnet for MagSafe if we’re lucky. Other than that it’ll be the iPhone 15 before you see always on display or any other features mentioned here
It looks more like an android now, and iOS 14 didn’t help either because android has that same thing!! What is apple doing lately?
Touch ID back 🤞
7:50 lmao y'all hear that voice crack
Wait... how you not verified???
Iphone 13 photos leaked   Me who still has the iphone 6
YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY    WIRELESS CHARGING ALL THE WAY
I respect the hustle. . . But I’m not paying 30 bucks plus tax plus shipping. . . For a phone case when 5 below got them and they work as they should
Apple slacking once again. How the hell did they go from a new technology that allows the entire screen to scan our fingerprint to a small optical fingerprint scanner?
Love your work keep it up
I hope apple will dies sooner than later. And I hope China will put them to the ground.
NOOOOOOO!!!! @EverythingApplePro Flip loss 3000 XP by throwing on the Nike hat with adidas merch. On top of yet again another delayed Rebel Series release, wild times man...
Still that outdated notch
Portless phones will alienate so many cars for CarPlay
Is anyone else's YouTube lagging on the computer? My internet is fine and computer is fine...but YouTube is lagging for some reason. I notice this scrolling on a page or trying to full screen a video. Internet is 500 down so that is not it.
The skipped 11s for obvious reasons. September 11th
Gimmie that fuckin lens cover I’m lovin how clean it’s lookin I’m sick of looking at my fuckin Alien stove top on the back of my 12 Pro Max I can’t wait 😍 and fuckin Touch ID coming back this is already an automatic upgrade for me I can’t wait to trade in my 12 Pro Max 😍
I love watching videos about things which I can't buy.
5 times ad of samsung f62 in a single video
AirPods,AirPods 2,AirPods pro,AirPods Max and after that comes AirPods fast and the furious
Waiting for the iPhone 13 Pro 2022 so I can finally upgrade my iPhone XS
I’m commenting to get more subscribers. Just being honest, I have nothing to say about the video.
Everyone complaining about charging ports leaving is a moron. Yes currently wireless is a huge waste of energy as they are not efficient but also this was going to happen one day in the future regardless of how any of us feel about it. Just how technology moves forward whether its apple or somebody else.
Now this is what I call an upgrade I still naught the 12 pro max even tho trashing it for not having enough upgrades 🤣😂 I’m just an apple fan boy and spend me moooney on apple
People stop caring about iPhones from iPhone x
Waiting on IPhone 30 Pro Max
I just want then to ditch the notch 😂
No portless please, currently I’m not using fast charging since I noticed that my iPhone’s battery life isn’t the same as if I charge it using regular 5w charger. And wireless charge makes my iPhone warmer that usual, I’m trying to preserve battery lifespan, and give this iPhone in good shape to my mom, and I don’t think wireless is that healthy. Anyways this is me just making wishes haha
Terminator meme was hilarious 🤣😂
Need the charging port for hotspot while playing games, wireless hotspot makes the phone an oven!
if they put a fingerprint scanner in the screen, does that mean screen replacements won't work anymore? like the finger print scanner wont work, like touch ID wont work?
bro what iPhone are we even on I'm fucking lost dead ass LOL
Why do people hate the notch on the iphone. well in my eyes its good 😌 even though i don’t have a iphone 10 or up lol 😂
My iPhone X has been having tons of issues. I didn’t want to upgrade to the 12 pro six months after it came out. I want the better 13 to keep for several years
please don’t remove the port 🙏 apple i’m begging you
I really don't want this port less stuff to happen yet.
Wow that video quality difference between the iPhone 12 Pro Max and the S21 Ultra really shows how impressive Apple’s video handling is. And they usually make it even better over the lifespan of the iPhone. My XS Max has gotten much better at handling color over the last 2 years. Cannot wait to upgrade to the 13 Pro Max and really excited to try out Portrait video.
Hmmm... Nothing new, everything is already on Samsung s21 Ultra .. when will Apple come up with something new and their own that they have not plagiarized or stolen from others? "Always on Display" is this a joke? Samsung has been using this for several years now, it's outdated news. And astrophotography, have you seen the moon taken with s21 Ultra? This is also old news. Reverse charge? This has been on Samsung for several years now.... AirTags? Do you mean Samsung Galaxy Smarttag?? Yes Samsung have them since............ okay you get the picture, I do not need to write anything more. So what's really new at Apple???? 120Hz refresh rate? Oops I forgot, this is also outdated news....
It won’t be called iPhone 13
Just ordered one crystal g2 . Can’t wait to try it out ❤️
Hahha what portles ? I switch to samsung! 😂
i got the iphone 12 on Christmas and that phone gonna satisfy me for a while 😂
U verry nice person
Outstanding report👍👍
I really hope the new iphones are not portless
I work for A cellphone company and haven’t sold a 12 mini since November. Everyone just goes with a 12 and some mix of 12 pro and 12 pro max
Still has a notch? Not interested -_-
Add me doing a bun h of giveaways
Add me guys
Bruh they keep saying no charging port since the iPhone 5 😂
Who is here just to watch everthingapplepro after long time?
Sheeeesh just got my iphone 12 because of covid had a delay and iphone 13 leaks already😂
I am excited about the fingerprint sensor!!
Tried the 12 Pro.. but my 11 Pro is nicer for one handed us😥
These are all Rumors. There not Leaks. Leaks are real features of a product that are guaranteed to be on the product when brought to market. Rumors are what you have here as always. Not 1 individual mentioned knows anyone who works for Apple or who has worked for Apple at any point in time. These are all guesses based on previous history and future wants.
I've been saying that the next iPhones are going to be an S upgrade and be called the iPhone 12s Pro/ 12s Pro Max since May of 2020. Go figure that Max Weinbeck is copying my prediction.
Everything sounds great except for the portless feature. I do not like that idea ... You have always keep a macsafe charger in your pocket.
Apple knows how to make a sexy ass phone🔥 I love my 12 pro max in pacific blue! Something about the black over the camera makes it look so damn sleek!! The 13 is going to be one clean looking phone !!
They really need to boost the Camera megapixels
Bij plss.....i buyed iphone12promax and this 13 release??? Oh bruh sugar daddy is not easy
I've been waiting for a 120 hz iPhone for so long and now they're gonna remove the port on it and make me not want to buy it :(
I hope they work on a thermal cooling solution and it’s not just a rumor because this iPhone 12 gets piping hot at times
I think it will just be called iPhone. You heard it here first ;-)
Bhai Iphone 12 ko purana to hone de 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
As long as I’ll be able to watch YouTube 1260p 4K on my iPhone, I’ll be happy
The black camera won’t look nice
Just ordered my Crystal Clear case!
Still on iPhone 5s 😂😂😂
Watching this on a note 20 ultra 5g
Those renders on par with mkbhd quality 🔥
If you think about it, iPhone 12S Makes Perfect Sense. It goes through a cycle. S, Camera, Redesign. iPhone 6s (s year) iPhone 7 (Camera) iPhone X (Redesign) iPhone XS (S year) iPhone 11 (Camera) iPhone 12 (redesign) So the logical way of naming the new iPhone would be 12s
Same trend has Apple product as company is not terminating its front display notch. Yet there are same things are repeating inside devices if check features and model. If again apple produces the devices having notches, it wont be success.
4:34 how it acctually looks like a Google Pixel phone 9:31 again copying Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei and other companies 10:31 and again copying Samsung, Xiaomi and Huawei
Here’s the newest false iPhone info! Hope you guys enjoy!
We want macro camera ,not better ultra wide
I wanna hear more about that SE plus🥲
In screen fingerprint scanner??
When is Apple going to release their folding screen models?
So I guess we’re never getting USB-C LOL
In France, manufacturers are required to put wired headphones in the box with the phone, I don't know how Apple will manage the portless idea with this law.
How do you have all the iPhone
The irony is the whole point of MagSafe on the MacBook is that it WOULD detach quickly in the event of tripping over the cable and not take your computer (or port) with it. Having it be stronger so it grips more firmly is literally going in the opposite direction of its namesake.
When will the Crystal Series gen 2 release for the iPhone 11 and older models?
Portless so you can't access you data directly next step is to register your iPhone wirh your retina and fingerprint when you first buy it.   This move towards 1984 is outta control. My phone I should be able to access it directly via a cable connection and move files modify it etc.
Lmao these cameras finna have every iPhone owner thinking they’re professional photographer lol
I just bought an apple leather case you guys took too long
Samsung be like Apple dropped the charging port so we are too
Telling about Apple and showing Samsung ads
Samsung ads sucks
I’m done with iphone. No charger, no buy.
Main wants:  1. Always on Display 2. Reverse Wireless charging (for AirPods) 3. 120 hz display   iOS 15: multi-app display functionality   And future models to bring back Ive’s symmetry and remove the camera bump
I watch iPhone videos from time to time make me appreciate my Android phone
Always on hmmm copying android phone
So cool🥺🥺
Him putting that beanie was so random lol
Portless.... I love my fast charger too much..
I Do Not support Nike!!!
Voice crack? 7:50
https://youtu.be/pqNKvRG9bUY
Real???
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE work on astrophotography, its insane on the Pixel, so imagine what it would be like with a crazy camera hardware, AND software just as good. 🤤🤤
Who’s Waiting for iPhone 14?👇
So u telling me Apple didn’t kno the magnets were weak... a whole year to develop a phone and they did realize the magnets weak... it’s a money grab... they will fix the magnets this year then make the a faster charger next year..
Still will be inferior to S21 Ultra optical zoom....guess I’ll wait
If those renders are accurate why wouldn’t they make a speaker that spans the whole width of the phone for better sound?  Bigger battery maybe?
Dam that’s a lot of leaks.
Who painted your wall? 😵
How is portless gonna work with CarPlay?
Same biscuits different packing 🏆 we call that tech lol
Will the 13 Pros still have the blue color
Way too many ads on a small video
So what about all the CarPlay vehicles that are not wireless?
This is the phone I've been waiting for
Are you also promoting Nike when you put on the hat 😂😂😂
https://youtu.be/QD9FcFswpTo can’t believe it
Portless is dumb no body wanna be charging your phone with a big fucking bump in the back of your phone making it uncomfortable tf
I wanted to wait for the iPhone 13 Pro series this year,  but I had been using a XS Max for my photography for some time and was ready to upgrade so I bought the 12 Pro Max. It’s had to justify upgrading to a new phone every year but it’s also kinda hard to resist 😂 I’m happy I bought what I did though cause it’s definitely an upgrade 😃 I think this year I am most looking forward to the thermal management and camera improvements ✌️
So it’s gonna be iPhone 12skip
Maybe the Matt titanium will be on the 1tb iPhone 13 pros or possibly it might be just on the max to justify the price somewhat
I don’t like Always on display. Why?
Still has the notch
Hopefully they are way better than the iPhone 12 series line up , I can’t use mine, to many issues. I still love iPhone though.
Have the iPhone 12 Pro Max gonna get the iPhone 13 pro max as well and the one after that 😌
Ehh still got my iPhone X and still loving it. Gonna wait out for that peri zoom camera which made me go 😯 on the Samsung phones.
This is why the “s” phones were always better. You get the new external redesign as well as the updated internals 😃
What is the point in buying a phone I it will be obsolete in a year
Anyone else DESPISE the thought of portless?
Personally I don’t see what the big fuss is to make a phone port-less, Like are there that many ppl taking their iPhone into the shower/bath or wanting to swim with their phone to take photos?!?.....  The level of water proof the iPhone’s have currently is enough & think it be a mistake to take away the one port now the iPhone’s have but if they replace that with a magnetic connection similar to how they had with previous laptops a few years back then that’s ok but otherwise I say if it’s not broke don’t fix it....🤷‍♂️ #justsayin
Samsung already hasthe a.o.d
Y is gen 2 only iPhone 12’s damn I need gen 2 for the 11 pro max no point to upgrade to a 12 lol
iPhone 6s to 13 for me 😌
JB?
not worth upgrading from an XR lol cheapest and best iphone
Still a big ass notch. Big L. I rather keep my 8 plus haven’t upgraded cause I hate the notch look.
A Pro phone with no ports!? That makes zero sense. The camera is proving itself to be capable to the next level and they want to cripple that! Lightning is a step down from usb-c and Apple wants to get to the bottom in a hurry.  So much for getting your buddies together and using your phones as a multi-cam set-up. Oh well...iPhone you had a good run.
Apple is going downhill ever since Jonny left.    Looks nothing like a slab of glass
What about apple car play ......
Y dont he ever talk about the open side cases?
Waiting for the iPhone 13
Plsssssss 100/author ways 200 give me 😭😭 😭😭 😭😭 plsssssss give me iam from India
+EverythingApplePro I’m coming up to Vancouver today 😊
Garbage Iphone!
Please get your audio right. It’s cracking
Would In screen ID help make the notch smaller (don’t need Face ID)
I still doesn't have the iphone xs max and apple launched another iphone 13?like god please Iphone xs max is okay with me🥺😊👆
Every year same shit just making the battery and pixels little better and ask lottery price for it
Why did you just randomly put on a toque? 😂
I ordered the Gen 2 Crystal series!! Should be here Wednesday!

Fuck magsafe wireless bs just use USB c
Have notch: Huge botch!
So it’s looking like there’s absolutely no reason to upgrade from my iPhone 12 Pro Max this year.
Half of your rumors are bullshit
The Apple phones never come out like the leaks. Anyone else tired of camera updates? I'm not a photographer so I just want a good overall updated phone but all I see changing is the dam camera so overdone already.
If port less  is happening how can someone connect their wired headphones? Especially if you have a hi res headphones.
not saferv for people with pacemakers??
QHD with 120hz or only FHD resolution?
I also think the titanium iPhone will happen next year or the year after.. it’s only fitting to match the Apple Watch casing after we got the redesigned iPhone 👌🦾
I feel like it’s gonna be an S year but time will tell, still excited as always to see a new iPhone 🦾🦾
Always on display is a new thing.. Lol totally not invented by Samsung in their galaxy S3's Edit: Actually I think there was an app for that on my S2 😂
Sadly I will not be able to get the NEWER iPhones because they have PWM! I am hanging on my iPhone 8 Plus for *dear life!*
His t-shirt is fire - anyone got a link for it?
2:58 is this a secret sponsorship?
Thumbs down for middle video adds!
Watching from the 12 pro max 🌹
I like that you say the %
Nice hair mate 😂😂👌🏼
Make the cases for older phones!!!!
I’ve sworn to not get another iPhone until the notch is gone. When do you realistically thing it’ll happen?
Hopefully the SE Plus comes in at $500 and is the XR with an A14. Then who cares what the other iPhones are everyone should just buy this phone. Phones are too damn expensive just to scroll through social media lol
Cant wait for this this so i can get the 12 😌 i currently have 11 i just updated from x 🤪🤪
will you make gen2 for iphone 13?
Should I change my 12pro max with 13pro max ?  Is it worth when it’s out ?🤔
Like your logo on Tesla model..😄
I have the iPhone 12 rn soooo i’ll keep this for a long time
Nice nike promotion
No port, no buy. What a dumb decision by Apple
I’ve been waiting for a few years now and I’m glad they are bringing 120hz displays to the iPhone 13 Pro Max
That wallpaper on the right monitor is sick
"11S PRO MAX" - too many syllables probably lol
next apple phone is SE Pro, Plus full display @ power button fingerprint
Do you include screen protectors with xs max gen 1 cases
2022- iphone 55,wtf??????
Just bought the 12 but hey I’m ready for the 12s.
The Matt titanium version will be the iPhone pro pro
I’m waiting for Apple 15 LOL 😂
Hope you’re getting out to enjoy the snow!!
Portless no bueno.
Waiting for samsung note 21 or whatever they launch. I'm interested in iphone 13 but I'm not interested in buying it. I would of pay $200 more to buy other companies phone then iPhone. Iphone  S U C K S
What about Touch ID and smaller notch?
if apple goes portless now i think it'll be a huge mistake. There are still a ton of people who use the lightning port, whether it's to listen to music or apple car play. and I think apple carplay would be the biggest reason for them to not go portless. theres noway people can use the feature now if apple goes portless. and that would be a big blow on that section for apple.
wait is gen 1 case going to be updated for iPhone 12 series?
The only part of a portless iPhone that bugs me is that my car does not have wireless CarPlay so I’m not sure how that would work. I may be hooped.
I don’t like this idea of wireless charging🤦🏽‍♂️ I’d rather have a normal charging port
U r more weak and skinny now 😜
Video: iphone 13 Me with an iPhone 6s: hang in there buddy ;-;
one big question when they remove the port is....how are we going use our phones while charging if we'd only have the wireless charging and no cable charging 🤔.  That's one big trade-off in my opinion. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Are they going fix the iPhone 12/pro video problem with videoing indoor light 💡 flickering.
Anyone else waiting on Apple to fully get rid of the notch & than upgrade? 👋🏻😎
Air tag.   Why why who need it
For portless iPhone to work, I also imagine MagSafe would have to allow data transfer for things like CarPlay.
Those rebel cases are my favorite cases for the IPhone. Waiting on mine to be delivered!!
I’m not upgrading until the notch is gone
AirTags and Apple Watch probably charge the same way.
It’s basically the same phone every year! This would be my 10th iPhone... Just trying something different this year. Fold 3
Iphone is getting boring day by day. No new fun features 🙄
i was gonna buy the 11 and then i heard the 12 coming out and now i hear the 13 coming out, and i still have the iphone 7 i was supposed to trade in 2 years ago. i don’t really care i’m jus sayin it’s funny how people upgrade every year, i like my iphone 7 but if i were to ever upgrade to the recent phone it would be a huge win for me and loss for apple
That flat camera 👌👌
I want midnight green for the new iPhone
Touch ID. ASAP.
Alright so gotta wait till 2022, not much difference at all
As soon the iPhone 13 is revealed, EAP would be talking about iPhone 14 leaks already
9:23 portless charging ok, but how would work with carplay when still 95% of cars require cable to work and we know from apple watch charging cable you cant recive /give data..
What happens to Apple CarPlay if they get rid of the port? My 2019 Ford F-150 does have Bluetooth but doesn’t have wireless CarPlay. Have you heard of a Apple certified dongle to support all those CarPlay users?
you’re hot. that’s it. that’s the tweet.
bye why do i have a crush on you 😭
So looking forward to what the iPhone 16 features will be when I upgrade my iPhone 11 😑
Airpods 2 yessss❤️
Might be bigger phone since it needs all that battery for always on screen refresh rate.  Plus 1080 screen. We might have to see how it goes.  If they get super fast charging and better cameras and longer battery for all day charge that's going to be cool.
2:59. In a year and a half, Filip's hat and T will look like a NASCAR event with seventy-four patches and stickers on display.
always on display nice pretty new feature
Keep that 60fps coming!
your phone setup video
I'm not excited to see I phone 13
I hope AW 7 have more data details for runners like Garmin watch 😔
I wonder how we will use CarPlay without the charging port
Joao felix??
Got my 12 pro max a month ago gonna skip this one until they redesign the notch
I always wait 5 years to get another iPhone because they add little details each year, and after 5 years there is a big difference
7:51 the voicecrack💀
So just more "exclusive," features the competition has had for years now? Gotcha. Lol
Didn’t the 12 just drop last month?😭
Like how I watch these but I can’t even afford new devices 😂😂
99.9999% of this features already in the market.
Your phone case looks better than others 😂
Imagine getting pinned by EAP
The one upgrade that would have made an “eye-turning difference” is a 10X lens like Samsung Ultra.
Do we get a pure black iPhone for the pro models?
Already??????
Nike is now doing product placement in your videos?
120hz display was a ‘’leak’’ for iphone 12 all the way up to  even two months before launch and we know what happened, the only leaks that seem to be accurate all the time are the appearance of the phone one, but not the features ones, at least not the important ones.
Me: still owning the iPhone 11 Pro - thinking it’s still brand new👁👄👁
I’m going to like and comment on every video you put out so the algorithm recommends your videos to more people. I’m just so glad you’re back.
Portless system will be very disappointed for Gamers, cause of wireless latency
nice seeing you back ApplePro
This 12s is not very appealing. Different strokes for different folks I guess.
I could maybe understand always on for the watch. But I don’t see why always on needs to be a feature for a phone unless it’s plugged in an charging tbh
Way to many adverts !!!!!!!!!!
pretty excited for this new iPhone 13.
Boss come on you got so much of apple so donate me an apple.😂
I just got a s21
Mehh
120hz, portless and touch id ? Never. Only for Pro maybe...
I thought everything apple pro is wearing a mrbeast merch XD
Where did you get that shirt?
sorry to be that one guy that complains on iphone users because android is way better: please just look up xiaomi mi 11 its under 800$ 120hz 108mp camera (iphone 12 pro max has 18) 4600mha battery, has macro camera, and runs android. just look it up please just trying to make u save a lot of money
Do u have any info about the launch of the M1 MacBook Pro 16 ???
Astrophotography on the iPhone?? Yes, please, and thank you!!!!!
So I can’t charge with my case/pop socket on my phone at the same time...?
2:15 bruh apple didnt had that, they are always so late with features ...XD
Mounts now please!!
Hey, Pls you should not wear ring on that finger.   It impacts the energy body.
Call me when notch disappears or is less intrusive, AOD comes on, artifacts are gone, customization is better, and more control of my device, which btw I pay premium money for. It's Note 20 Ultra for now! Not interested in Samsung following Apple's path either

First
Are these Cases sold on Amazon and ships to Canada?
Back looks like pixel 4a
Must make iPad rebel series
They skipped the 7s too
Going portless is Apple's way of forcing you to buy magsafe
the iphone 14 looks far more promising now
Im totally getting one of those clear cases.  Cool to see your hard work coming to the market!
Just upgraded to Iphone 12 pro max. Sh!t. 🙄
No way would I upgrade to a portless iPhone. I’m not going to buy $30 MagSafe chargers and carrying around a hockey puck in my pocket. Just go to USB-C so people can use one cord for everything...
i want touch-id back
i doubt we will see portless this soon, or in screen touch id. wireless charging needs to be at least 25w or 30w they will not go backwards in charge speeds.
Where is the iphone 12 case drop test?
they are looky coping samsung right know
It’s just gonna be the same phone like all of them just better camera
Is there a gen 2 for iPhone 11 pro Max?
More subtle with the plugs please  bud 😂 I miss the old days
I am a gamer and Vapor Chamber is a must as thermal throttling is a series issue in iphones
Looks like a Galaxy S20 Ultra rear camera cluster.  It's becoming very obvious that Apple and Samsung are just plain sucking each other's dicks at this point. Idk how to feel about it...
So next month for the new iPhone?
I was really hoping the notch would be getting smaller not thinner. Why would apple go back to the S names? Makes little to no sense if they tried to kill the name off. I’m very excited about the next iPhone, Apple Watch, “AirPods Pro” or “AirPods 3” and everything. Good video bro. Keep us updated on the leaks and software updates! Be safe everyone!
Sounds more like iPhone 12S with most of the changes being related to the camera
what happens to apple carplay for cars if they go portless?
Does he pin comments?
So excited for the revolutionary 120hz 2k pro motion crystal clear xdr plus display!
to bad the cases doesn't ship to Mexico i was so excited :(
That cheese grater in the background looks really nice, may I know where did you buy from.
Apple adding vapor chamber & 120hz for users.  Well.. what about gamers are they gonna play on their huge latency delayed airpods? If there is no port
I’ll upgrade my 11 pro max if.... iPhone 13 PM has: -> a bigger battery (lasting longer and bigger mah size) ->smaller notch or lack of ->Touch ID back
I wouldn't want always on display
If there making huge changes to this next year iPhone ,they might not make it a 12s series.They may call it iPhone 14
Nike hat Adidas jacket😒
Me to the big pro max
Make cases for galaxy phones
I reckon the lower end iPhone 12 and 12 mini will be the phones that become the 12s and 12s mini. Then the new pro models will be something special if Apple is planning on removing the ports, adding 120hz support and an in screen fingerprint reader (possibly calling them iPhone 21 Pro to match the year)
what a lame innovative feature. i had been using this feature with my ex wife. 😂
It looks like Google pixel isn't it?
Se 3 any leaks
All I'm saying is don't remove one color and then add a different one next year. The could have kept the green and added the blue. Please for the love of God let us get a code red pro max! Give the pro series phones some more color options instead of the same boring gold, white and black. Yes I said white, that is not what silver looks like!
Apple as usual lagging behind
The king is back with another video🥳
Iphone 13 pro gold edition video
I have been waiting for iPhone 16 for almost ten years ❤ cant keep waiting 😍
This video was not sponsored by any sports wear apparel
Will the iphone 12S be getting 10bit HDR display and 1600 peak nit brightness?
I got the 12 pro
Those renderings! Fire. Loved the donuts! LOL
I'm excited for portless iPhone because once apple does it , every other brand follows. So that we can live the future
S10 had all those things already 😂😂😂
Talk about cash grab. Good lord hahaha
Can’t wait to upgrade to the iPhone 13 from my iPhone 12🤟🏻
Well, it looks like I’ll be keeping my iPhone 11 for a while 😂💯
Yo philipp when will your thumb heal lol
Subcribe like
I've expected the iPhone 10 onwards to be revolutionary but each release now still can't tempted me to buy one, especially when cheap android have become better
What do we know about the battery life of the new iPhones and 120 hz screens?
Gib me iPhone... Bangladesh
MrBossFTW Iphone Version
every year: 120 HZ CONFIRMED GUYS apple at the events: ha sike
iphone 13 will be the perfect phone in 2021   “SCREENLESS”. 🤣
Hi
I hope they don't go portless. I use wired CarPlay all the time. If they go portless I have to buy a stupid dongle
Sorry, this is not really the moon, but you get the idea here🤣
Apple copy samsung
But what about people with a mechanical heart (sry idk the english for it) cuz Apple even warned people with such an heart to keep the Iphone 12 far away or the magnets can cause problems.
Don’t cancel mini iphones! 😭
Thumbed down due to no mention of data security
Fuck man my iPhone XS Max is having screen touch issues and I think i need to get a new phone but I wanted to wait for this year. And I’m all set with a port less phone be wise how exactly are you supposed to get photos and other stuff off? Or if the phone bricks then what send it to apple? Nah I’m good
I don’t think there is any new feature in positive way (for us customers), reducing features but keeps the price same (if not increasing)
I hope they don’t take the lightning port out since it’s an S year. I’d be fine if they switch to USB-C though.
portless this year yes or no?
Nike sponsorship?
I was so sure I wasn’t gonna upgrade, but if that 120Hz is true, I might be. Damn it. 😂
Damn. I'm still on the iPhone 7 Plus and every time, Apple announces things, it makes me hesitate and want to wait for the next year model.🤣
I'm not mad that Apple would be removing the port.  I'm scared that Samsung would follow.
Brother I need a phone so give me a phone brother please
I have an iPhone Mini and I absolutely love it! I think they made a mistake with naming, calling something “mini” will always turn people off. Yes the price might be a bit high, but it’s still the cheapest iPhone 12 available.
"6:45" Yea i've been getting paid with 𝗣𝗣𝗢𝗡𝗟𝗖𝗔𝗦𝗛.𝗖 𝗢 𝗠 i'm making over $1422 a week with them!   ਹਰ ਜੰਤਰ ਤੇ ਉਪਲਬਧ ਹੈ
When are AirPods Pro 2 coming out
Your renders have improved significantly. 👏🏾👏🏾
Can’t wait for the iPhone 13 to come out so I can finally get the iPhone XS Max ❤️
What about battery upgrade..?
Love apple but we need a port for pro use of our phones
So in terms of mobile phones, do you have any idea what apple may be dropping this first quarter?? Last year they dropped the SE 2020 this year???
Here we go again ,airtags release for march or april ,then at the end of april apple decides delay for this june ,,then june delayed till sept event ,,then you get the drill grrr 😡
I tried to order crystal case but doesn't ship to India
The dam 12 just came out all that shit u put on it now should have been done come on apple ya really tripping
When iPhone 13 will release ???
I don’t want a phone with no ports, that‘s HELL
Always On?
btw if they go portless they wouldnt leave a random gap there they would extend speaker grill and move pentelope screws to the outside
Apple Car drop test?
AirTags price?
I love Apple products
Can you do a review on the new case
Can't wait to get one of those crystal case
You lose your scape
Samsumg has a always on fubktion since the s6 😂😂😂
Will apple include 120 hz display?
আমাকে একটা দিয়া যায় না....?
Shipping on your Rebel cases is way too much to ship to Canada, I can’t pay $14 and wait TWENTY days for the case mate... solve that issue and I’ll buy your case for my 11 Pro Max and my girls 12 Pro Max
Yo I heard that voicecrack 😂 7:50
Will upgrade from my Xr 😊
13 pro was gonna be my first iPhone, but if its portless that's a yikes from me. I'll either get a 12 Pro or something else then.
iPhone 13 will not exist, the teoretic name is iPhone 12S.
Thing is with apple they release something new and it doesn’t  take to long before it gets outdated ....
hi i realy want the iphone 12 pro max.but i dont have money to buy.please help me to make one.thanks
What we also do need is an iCloud storage upgrade like from 5gb to 10gb or more, and sometimes have issues like when emptying the storage it isn’t decreasing, and giving more space
I think a potential reason the 12 wasn’t called 11S was because there wasn’t a 11 mini , so having a 11S mini out of nowhere wouldn’t make sense
Hopefully that extra thickness will make the battery bigger, that was the reason why I didn’t upgrade to the 12, I just feel that apple can do a bit better with their batteries
Thank god, I was worried there wouldn’t be a 13mini, after seeing all the cancellation rumours.  It’s what I plan to upgrade to, from my XS
WTf man , just bough iPhone 12 2 months ago :D
The reason for the XS was because they skipped the iPhone 9 and had to catch up
I will give up the s21 ultra only if the new iPhone will be called "iPhone 13 Ultra Pro"  :)))
It’s it good to upgrade from Xs max To this year coming iPhone pro max ?
iPhone 13 will have 65 rear cameras and a notch that is bigger than a house
Waiting for A14x
The only way I would get an iphone : Fix overheating BS  remove the 2015 notch  120hz screen Make camera better and give me more options .. Give me more features
I fail to understand why the removal of the port? This is going to cause more issues to consumers. Wired CarPlay will no longer work. Ability to recovery mode restore. There’s a few others to. My understanding MagSafe doesn’t data sync
Is it worth upgrading to an iPhone 13/12S from a 12?
Hey man , how long would it take to ship to Australia? For iPhone X
Bro I think you will get job in Apple for sure
eager to see notchless only
I just want the price of the 12 mini to go down when the 13s are released
Touch ID + 120Hz = buy buy buy. Without either of these two = iPhone 7 will stay for another year.
Drop that peace line. It sounds weird and out of place
It's nice to see you back on the air.
hanggang iphone xs max lang aq 😂
only a matter of time before they do away with the screen.
Wow mag safe can now kill people faster if u have a pacemaker and put in ya pocket , left chest!!!!!
Would like to know more about the SE Plus! Cant wait until u update on that!
damn, so is their going to be anything exciting for Watch this year? I was gonna upgrade from my 3
why would they make a 13 mini after this years disaster? just another reason not to believe these claims..
iPhone 12S Pro Max????
How u connect portless iphone to Win PC tho?
Should we wait for it
SE Plus im excited
Always on display, really! How many years now has Android had that for now. 😏
🔥🤍
I am using iPhone 6s charger plugged in 😭
apple barely gives us anything exciting anymore. always next year......
so dissapointed "Always on" is an hardware feature , thought it could come with IOS15...
Hate it that Apple never puts in any interesting features. Wow, I can make photos of the moon. Why can‘t I have 120hz, longer battery and no fucking notch? Damn this shit is gettin sad af for apple
Am I the only one that would rather have a notch that’s not as tall instead of not as long?
Fix the glare during nighttime video 😫
For no reason whatsoever let me wear a hat .....😑
Apple please make a 7" iPhone
I thought you were sponsored by Nike when you put the hat on mid video
android users are bored 😂
Glad I got the 12 I hate the MagSafe
Just can't watch this.too many adds
MagSafe doesn't need to get stronger, it HAS to become more efficient to remove lightning. How do you connect to iTunes with MagSafe? How do you back up your iPhone with MagSafe? How do you fast charge with MagSafe? How do you transfer photos & videos with MagSafe? How do you reinstall your firmware with MagSafe?  If you VERY STRONGLY agree with my comment, you must not put any likes or comments on it.
Apple don’t give a f*** about battery upgrades don’t they? In the near future apple will tell us to buy a portable battery from  them to power the iPhone cuz the whole battery will be 1500mah . 😂
2018: This year the Notch will almost certainly be getting smaller 2019: This year the Notch will definitely be getting smaller 2020: This year the Notch will definitely be getting smaller without a doubt! 2021: This year the Notch is definitely getting smaller just not in the way you think.  I'll take these leaks with a grain of salt until it finally happens.
STOP GIVING US HOPE!  I hate how he promises us all these wonderful things (that Samsung already has) to apple users and we believe him right till the end and every single time apple is underdelivering and screwing us over... THIS YEAR with the 12 Pro Max I expected at least a smaller notch, Touch ID (in screen or at least in the power button like the iPad Air 4), 120Hz display (and always on display), 128GB BASE MODEL (not 64GB, that’s barely enough for 2021 usage) and for crying out loud A 20W FAST CHARGER AND EarPods IN THE BOX!!!!  Not only is apple underdelivering, but they’re also including less in the box... 🥲 I love the iPhone but TIM COOK is not and will never be as good as Steve Jobs..... I’m 110% sure that if Steve Jobs was still around, we would’ve had all these features I listed above and more BEFORE THE COMPETITION! With Steve Jobs apple was the superior brand and was always ahead of everyone else! Now even the knockoff brands like Oppo (the brand name is literally how the Chinese pronounce ‘apple’ in China or at least very close to it), Xiaomi and Huawei have superior tech (in some ways) than apple... Samsung is ahead BY A MILE (hardware wise, not software wise) if apple didn’t have the superior software and eco system (that Steve Jobs created by the way) apple would not be as successful today as they are now..... Steve Jobs even after all these years is STILL making sure that apple remains on top because TIM COOK can’t make better hardware than fricking SAMSUNG.... I mean for crying out loud Samsung makes fridges and TVs and all these other stuff AND STILL they deliver better hardware than apple (except the chip... the A14 is the better chip but that’s it...)whilst apple is ONLY doing phones and tablets and PCs and monitors etc you get my point.... I’m just disappointed in apple (Tim Cook)! Don’t get me wrong I love some of the things that Tim Cook has done for apple, but if you compare apple to Samsung 7 years ago or now you get what I mean....
The leaks promises so much from apple it is even hard to believe the specs you are talking about. Will apple really do that much upgrades in a one release? I don’t think so.🧐
Do you think there will be a new se by aug
Removing the charging port is a terrible idea.  How am I going to use CarPlay in my car? Like 90% of most cars, my car doesn’t support wireless CarPlay. And I use CarPlay every day. So , without buying a whole new damn car, how am I going to use CarPlay? It’s way too soon to remove the port.
Rather buy the iPhone 12 for cheaper then
This time will be on ultra telephoto with most of higher advanced on most life will be pretty
Ok what if someone fiends your airtag and destroys it, still a loss
Why does the rebel case not ship to India😭😭😭
I just bought the 12 two weeks back❤️
iPhone mini was the best one
Disliked for the amount of adds !!
Waiting for iPhone 13 ❤️
Only problem I have with portless is that they’ll have to come up with a solution to using your phone in your car for music!
no lie, i just came back after 3 years and just wow. good job on ur yt bro
Happy to hear 13 mini is still  in making and is still kicking alive.
All iPhones the same now 😴
I can live without headphone jack I can live without charger not included or headphones not included but i cant live without the charging port.  My actual phone is a 12 pro max which i like very much. But when apple does that with no charging port im gonna change to android.  I had the 3gs  The 4  4s 5 5s  6s plus  7 plus  Xs max  And now the 12 pro max  And dont like android but when it comes that far with the without charging port im gonna change to android
I would think Tesla would be very likely with the car key feature, and you could add the Tesla keycard in an app.
He put on that nike beanie in the middle of the video cause he realized he was doing adidas free product placement 😂
Wheres mah real stereo speaker
Portless and what about the CarPlay?
About notch will it remain or go
Wow awesome super
Before every event all I hear is “air tags happening 110% next event, trust bro” but it never happens.... smh
Hi can you please make a video on how to Jailbreak ios 14 with a windows pc?
What about that nike beanie?
damn i was hoping that iphone 12 mini would be a success because i really want them to make smaller phones i didn't buy a mini because i wanted the pro cameras and design + i want to get the 120hz pro next year so if i get used to a smaller phone, it's gonna be harsh getting back to a big one i wish they could make a pro mini with 120hz but it's never gonna happen, the battery would last 1 hour lol
If portless iPhones do become a thing how are you suppose to back up to your Mac??? What about cars that need the lightning port for Apple CarPlay?
Air pods pro max
S Cycle means SHITE upgrade cycle
Bro when are you going to post jailbreak and iPhone unlock/bypass videos
I just want touchID to be back so bad, thats the breaking point of buying another iPhone for me
Why. Don’t. They. Just. Put. TouchID. In. The. Power. Button. ? ? ?
IPhone 13 pro series mayn't have charging port.. Charger people brought for 12 series is going to be  e-waste. My doubt.. A120Hz display drinks more energy than 60Hz then. Still wireless charging system is not efficient and fast as wired one. So,do they reduce the battery size to recharge the battery fast..?
Go bed
Did it get cold after 3 minutes? Why the need for the hat?😆
Great video as always but I have a question for you and everyone really. I love my music, how would I move music from my Mac desktop to my phone? Thanks everyone and excited about the Pro Max model this year!
is this a sales advert or leaks video
Glaube Apple muss mal ein richtig drauf legen.
Awesome
It should be iphone 15 A15 & 15th generation
Am an android fan after using iPhone XS
Can you release your case with white sides? I’ll buy one ^^
Anyone watching on an iPhone XS?
So what you’re saying is, wait till 2022
Oh  crap my HEART!  You fools realize, what EMF amd 5.0g will do?
120hz display and a smaller notch he said hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahhahahahahahahahahahahahah
If there’s no charging port I’d just get an iPhone 12
i don't think there will be portless iPhone maybe at least magnetic port because how do we sync or restore without a port?
I just want Touch ID back
Without these, what’s coming to  Watch in 2021? Aside from a redesign...
Box camera design is ugly.
Will you release the gen 2 cases also for IPhone 11?
All this sounds like an almost lost year for iPhone and Apple Watch. 🥲. Hopefully some details will change before the release.
Can aod be added with software update on IP 12 pro mx
wtf i should've just waited for the 13 </3 i just got my 12 pro
Can someone explain to me what airtags are suppose to be for?
Give me one please I'm poor 🥺
We want video on se3
Happy valentines day to all singles there 😃
I literally hate apple. But I follow you just because ur videos are good
Thank you man 🙏🙂
Who on gods green flat earth need 1TB of iPhone storage??????????  After almost 4 years on my 8+ i was not capable of filling 256. Even with 4K 60 as standard Videorecording.😂
damn im sad to see that your phone case are not the same design as gen-1 with the open sides... Gen 2 looks like any other case now.. what a waste
Wish list: - Touch ID  - 120 hz - no/smaller notch - usb c / portless
I just got the 12 Pro Max 😃😃
Portrait video is a sin
The only thing I hate about these videos is that they make me want the next iPhone now 😅
Bruu the s21 video was a fucking lie.the camera on the s21 is way better than the 12pro.and I’m an iPhone person.that was recorded on something different
Are you gonna sponsor unc0ver?
There are too many ads throughout this video that’s it’s not worth watching. YouTube gotta fix this.
If IPhone 13 has 120hz screen then I will buy
The finger print they copied Samsung
12 min is nice but is  expensive for that size
No charging port is a huge yikes. So uhmmm
Hopefully still with charging port....how would I connect to apple car play otherwise...and i don't have a wireless charging module in my car
Why is there a iPad Pro coming out they normally come out every 3 years I purchased the last one in 2020
I have a suggestion. how about airpod cases
That looked like a wig at first tho😹😹
Carkey is already working with some BMWs
You sure theres gonna be a 13 mini? Theyre not selling well
Will we get any magnetic puc like the one with Apple watch considering the iPhones go portless?
Is it just me hated being fooled by this company ? Greedy to make profits.
S21 records as astigmatism, it's not a feature!
Touch id ???
how much will you pay this time? $2K? 😂😂
YouTube without you just wasn’t the same, thank you for being back king.
Watching this on my 12 pro after upgrading from 6s 👀
iP12 might have brought back so wanted sharp edge design but having it in the hands - iPhone12 - it feels fucking cheap. I think the weight is responsible for the feeling. It is so unnecessarily light.  I am glad for my iP11 and I plan to switch to the iP11 Pro.
I spend my most of time in “recording”,“gameplay” and “editing” and “uploading” . I need all my brothers and sisters to support me 🙏🙏🙏🙏ijg
Spot on content really enjoy watching 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Are we still getting the Rebel v2 case without the sides???
Will it have usb-c, I only have usb c chargers right now.
I follow you from Egypt and I love your explanation very much❤️❤️
I don't understand what the big deal is about "car key" for Teslas... We already have Bluetooth automatic unlock. :T
I tkink in hqrdware they gonna change the microphone and light position along with charging is onnly gonna be wirless
Nice
I hate it when apple does those stupid moves removing things,problem is that all the other major companies like samsung and others will then follow this crappy step like they did with the charger and the box. Yes,we can live without the headphone jack,i personally like wireless more because there are no more wires going to my ears,but wireless charging is not as fast as the wired solution especially on an iphone,and also if you're away and you need a powerbank to charge the phone what are you going to do? Duct tape it to a wireless powerbank? I was hoping for 144hz screen with aod so i could consider buying the 12s/13,but without a charging port they will manage to also ruin my other options because all dumbasses need to keep in trend with apple even tho they are always the ones to bash it or make fun of it
Sucks I can’t look forward to upgrading my iPhone past the iPhone 11, because the magnets in the newer iPhones are strong enough to effect Pacemakers and defibrillators, and I have a defibrillator.
No charging port? How am I supposed to use CarPlay in my car as I only have wired CarPlay as do most CarPlay users I suspect. That's a big enough NO for me personally to not buy this model. Shame - was looking to upgrade my 8 Plus this year. Oh well, I'll just get a new battery in the 8 Plus and go with it for another few years.
Seems like a quiet year for iPhone/Apple Watch. This year is all about them Macs.
I would buy the case if it didnt have the R on the back :(
If they go port less what happens to people being able to connect CarPlay, not everyone has wireless CarPlay ?
Finally      Always on
Anyone else has overheating issues when using Group FaceTime? Coming from an iPhone 12 Pro Max
BMW have had the car key feature since the summer? And from the new IX, they will have keyless entry from the iPhone
I love how EAP covers so much leaks in a 10min video when other youtubers cover each topic individually in multiple 10min videos. Not pointing fingers or anything 🤷‍♂️
I totally forgot this guy exists. Hes just here.
What happened to Samsung phone cases?
By any means if you know about apple wallet for bitcoin. is it possible?
Portless: No please no! Vapor cooling chamber: Yes please
Bro kindly make available rebal product India at Amazon
Apple : 12 MP camera stays  we dont gaf , our ecosystem peeps will buy it anyhow  !!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😂😂😂
Hey everybody 👋
why you got a giant cheese grater behind you?
Sponsored by Nike by any chance? 😂
why dont they put best texture for iphone 12 ? Apple : Stop right there !! we saved it for Iphone 13 , you ll buy it anyway so we dont care 😂😂😂 For heart issues intercepted by Magsafe ? we dont hear it at all,   all we want is make money 😂
Touch ID exclusive for the Pro models, or will all models get it?
Praying we do get a iPhone 12🅂 mini 🙏🏼
Love from pk
Apple will developed faster Chi Charger For iPhone and faster Magsafe even in Charging the Apple Watch  and With a New faster Magsafe Duo. Even to a Point of 25W 8.5W with less Parts and Try to Have Leas Hardware. in Phone and Mac and Apple Watch and AirPods not just in Chip we can lower it by 1%-2%.
Got my phone case comin on Wednesday man...boutta make my blue look crazy
Why is 120Hz only on the pros? Samsung has 120Hz on all the Galaxy’s since years, like Oneplus and others companies does. Apple has nothing with innovation to do they just want to make more and more money
I don't get how Apple would change all the AirPods lineup to in-ear. I think there's a lot of people who prefers the AirPods 2 design because they consider it more comfortable. Let's see what Apple will do
What about iPad mini 6
Ugh, if backlight does come out, I am going to hate android fan kids complaining that they had them in their cheap-o tracking devices.
Yes! I missed these!
2:58 I love that Nike plug haha, do you have a multi-million dollar deal with them?😄
Air tags useless
I Came to see what is apple putting away @13🙏😂
An ad every 2;30 min man slow down lmao
I see that hien xl wine red at the back. 👀 great choice
Skip the first 1min 15sec.
💪👊
Finally catching up on samsung!
What about ipad pro leaks ????????
I'm just hoping that the Apple VR wouldn't cost an Arm and a Leg.
Love that case bro , looks really neat 👍
these covers not available in india sad.
Bro can you gift me one iPhone 12 pro max because u have a lot of iPhones with you and everything apple pro is king of iPhones……
Titanium? That’s gonna be even more expensive.
Why give Prosser so much time. He’s wrong more often than not.
I loved the iPhone mini but because the display is awesome I returned it and will go for the Max (2021) and keep my iconic iPhone SE (2016) for reserve
Your biggest fan from Abu Dhabi 💙
i hope this model fails in terms of sale if the removal of a charging port is real. look at what happened with every other phone when Apple decided to remove the headphone jack
No charging port would be a massive problem for people with wired connectivity with Carplay and drone.
2:59 And this video is sponsored by Nike!
I am confused. So, we are gonna buy an iPhone 12 Pro S Max Mate Ultra 6 G ??
im getting sick of asking where is the 12 mini cases in the gen one series as a case company u should still be supporting ur old cases in new gen of phones
*"Wireless charging is not Efficient as wired charging"* -Mrwhosetheboss    Gallium nitrite chargers are better........
Please ship to India
There is still notch. Nothing special. Still just an old phone
Apple will try to Built it's Chips and Motherboards and GPU with less parts and Holes to better the CPU, more Battery and leaa Money in killer Strategy. With Brilliant Designers even in iPhone 13 and Mac And AirPods and Apple Watch and more. Even in Camera and Battery and Audio Chip.hire Desigeners Chips that can do that and are פרפקטציוניסטים. woz יהיה זכרו ברוך. Ap
You question why did they skip 11S but you even stated long ago the reason they skipped it was due to the model redesign! xD
what about car play?
Apple is full of shit
Nice video , king
https://youtu.be/PS-Cp1MPbog
Okay. I bought the iphone 12 pro max just now ffs
iPhone in 2021 looks like a model to update finally.... what’s up with the Nike hat brand instead of Adidas!!
Everyones dream is happening 120hz and a smaller notch 🖤
Love from kerala❤
Why the iPhones freezes after doing screenshots? And also restart the phone also?
Still not a big fan of that camera design. I hope they stick to the same design they’ve been using for the past couple of years.
The smooth Nike product placement!
It just a dream phone for me nthg else 😭
Apple skipped the 11S because in Europe it has a bad connotation that name, 11S refers to what you call the 9/11, we call it 11S (meaning 11 of September).
Iphone 13 gonna kill all the phones
Tbh Astrophotgraphy is not needed at all but would be nice to have
Putting on that Nike beanie while wearing an Adidas shirt is like busting out an Android phone on this channel
Bro when will u launch this cases in India Please launch them asap
really smart publicity for nike !! at least it's a good sponsor 😉
I’m not gonna buy a new iPhone until they make the stainless steel side rails matte like they were on iphone 4. No scratches, no fingerprints!
Some people have said that they might skip 13 and go to 14 like they skipped 9
When will the case be shipped to India?
Prosser in NOT reliable and EverythingApplePro is also feeding us leaks that don't happen. Instead of leaks it's more like wishful thinking.
it will not be iPhone 13 it will be iPhone 12s, next year will be an s year.
JUST NEED THE NOTCH GONE
where can I get this case
Im officially getting tired of these leaks
glucose monitoring would be cool af
Is it worth getting the iPhone 12 Mini when it drops its price after the iPhone 13 lineup comes out?
Ah....🧐...their is no charging port......hmm interesting 🤔
Might as well go watch front page tech!!
Just ordered my Gen 2 case for my 12 Pro I’m excited!
Bruh I just got the 12 pro......
Portrait video finally!! 😍
Will they fix the extreme camera glare on pros?
Not upgrading until they get rid of the notch
ProseerTime   Trademarked
Anyone notice how scrawny his neck is compared to his head 😂😂😂
iPhone 13 aka the Pixel experience lol
SO COOL! Happy Val Day.
Looks awesome.. the same phone allover again. I honestly would love to know what people at Apple do all year as far as work is concerned🎈💃🏋️‍♂️
When we get your cases  in India
DAMN BRUH HOW MANY ADS IN ONE VID?????!?!?!
it would be nice if they release the mini model as SE next year! it's gonna be a hit!!
Apple should make a iPhone 13 pro mini
Apple pro back on his eco 😁
Apple and Tesla are so close that one day Apple will probably acquire them
Why did u have to put a beanie on 3 minutes in
Not looking forward to the portless design. *fingers crossed* it doesn't work out.
Heard that Mag safe draws more power, so electrical bills will increase?!? 🤔
I really want a matte titanium iPhone. I loved the stainless steel on the X but I hate it on the 12 Pro, it's a fingerprint magnet and it makes the brighter colors way too flashy.
@EverythingApplePro EAP are they releasing the new jailbreak with the new iphone cases?
Always on display? Please, no.
I think that if iphone no notch is the best smartphone.
If they stop making the Mini then I might need to buy one as soon as possible ‘coz I want that size on an iPhone.
Canceled, canceled, won’t happen, not this year... The same shit every year
Knowing Apple we can expect like 2% of this to be true
Battery?
YouTube maybe full of Apple Leaks, but you’re the one I really wait for! 😁
There is a rumor Apple will release Airpods SE
why don’t u ship to india??
NOTCH !!!!!!
I got confused when he said AirPods 2 pro LMAOO
Apple sucks
Adidas lost him? Smooth how he put on that Nike hat 😄
You forgot more features in iOS 14.5 release beta 1 the new version
From Pakistan 🇵🇰
Brand stacking is a no no.....
I am planning to buy iphone 13 mini But if it doesn't have 120hz display, I will skip and buy android instead
Favourite YouTuber  Love from India 🇮🇳
Why didn’t they put MagSafe in the lightning port. I don’t like the new big round chunk on the back 👎🏻
Am i the only one who is waiting for the SE+ rummors because the 13 (12s) mini really isnt going to be a very big hit, apple needs to give us a new buged phone with a new desing for 2021
Here It's  5 a.m. but I couldn't wait🇦🇷
Until apple doesn't fucken bring 120hz in real life I ain't believing this bs they have been bsing 4 the past 2 years about 120hz being a thing on ios n a smaller notch apple keeping saying that next year will be the huge upgrade n well to be honest with apple members since they iphone x we haven't had an huge upgrade like even when going from they iphone x 2 12 pro max other than the design it isn't as big of an upgrade as even jumping from an iphone 7 to an x which is only a year older n even from the more budget flagship 2017 iphone 8 upgrading 2 an iphone x feels bigger than x to they 12pro
iPhone 12s Pro Max (that’s a long name)
as soon as the new iphone has always on display feature, I'm going to switch that from my current pixel 4a
why is there no charging
7:51 Voice crack
Would love to know if there are any iPad mini 6 rumours!
Adakah orang indonesia
So the iPhone 13 is basically a iPhone 12 Pro Max extra ??
If they remove the port my god what a mistake that will be 😔
If it doesn’t have a charger why is there still a gap in the middle? Why wouldn’t there just be speakers all the way?
I think it's because of the better battery when it comes to increased girth.
Apple is getting boring! Love Apple I have everything Apple but come on bring out something cool.
We need Gen-2 case for iPhone 11 line up
That  new camera bump looks like a google pixel. But will the tech legend comment? 🤔
I’ve always wanted an always on display on iphone but dont really want to get a whole new phone for it. Hope apple enables it as a software update with on and off toggle  If it will be portless atleast give us quad or tri speakers apple. And I wonder how computer backup and restore work with portless iphones
is iPhone 13 mini likely ?
Yeah...The 11s didn’t exist because since the 6 (this is something that Tailosive Tech said and I think he is right) there was a “1st” gen product (6 and X) followed by an S year (6s and Xs) and then a camera year (7 and 11) this would be excluding the iPhone 8...so this will be the first generation product if you will. Do bare this in mind this pattern has only been happening twice
I love Apple product about everything it . I think iPhone 13 it will be my fist phone, I'll budget for it.
if the iphone is gonna become portless, will you get magsafe in the box?
Extremely excited about Astro mode. As a novice astrophotographer, I really like the capabilities of the iPhone 12 and a dedicated mode will be just enough to scratch that itch without even thinking about buying an expensive camera.
Last time you leaked fake iphone 12 leaks. This is so fake
Whtthe?
They skipped 11s because there was a redesign.
And here I thought apple would skip the number 13 because “13” being a “unlucky number”.
Not shipping to India though :(
I feel like I’m watching the news but like Apple edition lol
Funny how apple fans think that they did something unique and Android has been doing the same thing for years
Who saw an advertising of Nike in 3:04?
i used to watch apple leaks everyday and follow it so closely for years. now i've just had enough, i love my oneplus phone, i love the features it has had before the iphone had them. but we all know, as soon as apple comes out with these features (120hz, under display fingerprint reader, customisability of the home screen, 5g) apple will pretend they invented it and sell it for double what's reasonable.
exciting things coming to the watch and phone, thanks for a good video
Hey guys.. any news on an official iPhone 12 battery case?
This is a really odd request.. if you see this. Could you send me an audio file and let me mix it to make your voice audio to sound super clear for your video?    Let me know, much love EAP bro 💜🔥
Last year you bought 4 camera iPhone and said this is the upcoming iPhone 12 pro And the iPhone 12 pro is still with 3 cameras😂😂😂 i think this also will be fake😂😂😂
Notch👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎💩💩💩💩
Hi, thanks for the info. I have a question, for different reasons that are very long to explain but I can summarize it. I have an iPhone 7 plus 128GB that stopped working. I sent it to repair and the person left it worse, it works everything but to make any type of call, WhatsApp, messenger, normal call, even record a voice message and after the "repair" stopped vibrating. I would buy a new one but I'm unemployed since March, living in another country, I have 118 GBS in photos, memories, mails, etc. on the mobile phone and I have to change the sim every time I want to make a call or receive. Among so many iPhones you have, do you want to exchange mine with one of the same model 7 plus 128? You may never read this, but it's worth a try.  best of luck with your videos! cheers!
*Me watching this with an IPhone 12 Max Pro, & AirPods Max thinking I’m outdated* 😅
Everything you said about iphone 12 didn't come into fruition. So take this video with large amount of salt
First
🔥🔥🔥
120hz and always on is the new innovation but sounds familiar. Wait, not just that
I’m excited, getting this phone the day it drops after years of having an iphone 7 🤦🏽‍♂️😂
I got a S21 ad before the video
Why so many ads, it gets annoying
If the iPhone will go portless, how will this work for drone pilots and people who wants external microphones?
Do you ship the rebel series in India ?
Can’t wait for iPhone 69420
thanks for the information, but Im little bit disappointed that the Iphone 13 is not going to have the periscope zoom
thicker body? nice, i feel the 12 is a touch too thin, so picking up the phone without case is a bit awkward.  just hope the thickness means more space for a bigger battery in the mini.
The best man is back on form
ទើបសន្សំលុយទិញបាន12pro ង៉ៃមុនសោះលូវចេញ13proទៀតបាត់សូសេត 👍👍
EAP: We will have 120hz  Apple: They said they would like 90hz
I would buy it if it doesn't get the nodge
Alus euyy
Happy valentines❤️☺️
A long awaited video is here
The saviour is here.. ☝
I love your youtube channel and I subscribe to your youtube channel. But I am an android user. I have a samsung galaxy A11 android smartphone. But I watch your youtube channel because I think you are a cool guy. And I watch your youtube channel because my brother is an apple fan but he does have time to watch youtube videos because he is busy working his job. So I keep him up to date on everything apple related. My brother has an apple iphone 11 smartphone.
I got 3 ads unskipabble before video started 😑
My 12 pro max start flickering, u can see on my channel
I knew I should have waited a little longer to switch back to iPhone LOL.  I still love my 12 pro max though.
I like the look of the new lens if that actually happens and it looks like that but I wonder how dbrand skins are gonna fit on it 😬
I dont understand why go with in screen fingerprint sensor when they can put it onto the power button
How can they make the MagSafe magnets stronger when it’s already hurting people with pacemakers
I’ll be waiting 4 2022 , I want that super zoom
47 minutes
Can you make screen protector cover the face id part too? Cuz i have used those open top part screen protector and it scratched so bad.
I am ready for the 13 I’ll gladly trade in my 12 pro max would be interesting to try no being able to have a charging port in my everyday life ...sadly my car doesn’t support wireless car play so that’s a down side
am quite interested about the battery size
Have u got any news on iphone se plus?
we need a category in video!
3:16 Jesus Christ that Samsung video is fucking awful 🤢🤢
They are copying Samsung
I just bought my 12 pro today STOPPP 😭😭😭😭
so whats up with the hat?
So no charging port means no way to connect CarPlay, unless you’re lucky enough to have one of the few cars with Wireless CarPlay. 😕
Where to cop that NIKE beanie?
I hoped for always on display for older devices like iPhone X but I guess not
Nice me to bhai ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Amazing bull shit again..... go for s21 ultra or fold2
How about ios 15 leaks?
Just ordered my Crystal Clear case!
Ok, now this is news!
After years of watching your videos, it has come to a point where I just watch your video no matter what content it is.  (Just to clarify, it has nothing to do with this video lol, I love videos about apple leaks 😬)
No please..stop removing ports..
I will be buying one of the clear cases of my 12promax how much will cost for shipping?
A nike beanie and and a adidas long sleeve?   Law breaker
I might get a rebel case not gonna lie, can anyone give me their thoughts ?
❤❤❤
NOICE
Maan give me
Where can we buy just the screen protector
A 12 Pro Mini would be my ideal phone, tbh. only reason I skipped on the 12 mini was cameras/LIDAR.
All de new features u excited talkin about has been on Samsung.. For years😂💔.. Super fast reverse wireless charger... 120htz display.. On screen touch Id..always on display.. Even A50s are having 😑.. Portrait video..... Looks like u wayy behind in tech and ideas 🤣... Ur leaks looks boring noww all ur leaks are already on de market
WTF? I’ve been using my 12pro max as a key for my Tesla MY since I got it. How is it a future opt??
Finally fully  copying the android 😂
We need vedio on se 3 and se plus and 12 s
Eap you should upload more often ... we miss you ❤️
Istg the camera bump on the iPhone 13 concepts is the same size as the apple watch displays 😂
Do you think that the AirPods Max will get a charging case like the  the other AirPods
iPhone 12 Mini isn’t selling as much ‘cause of the price. Price should’ve been like $550
When will the open case for 12 pro be available?
EAP: why did they skip the 11S?  Me: uh, why did they skip the iPhone 9!? If they’re using the number system, we gonna pretend 9 doesn’t come after 8?
I need a case for s9 plus 🥺 please
Just had to wear the hat at that moment huh 🤔
No charging port, it’s really stupid. Not everyone has a wireless charger everywhere they go
Happy Valentines day!!! 😁❤
EAP has been down bad lately
Was wondering where you went! Does your case company have your hands full?
$30 for a case. There are so muchhh better cases on Amazon for cheaper and better.   I'm talking from experience. Not to bash your work
iPhone 12s!! Better naming 👍🏻
apple just needs to bite the fuckin bullet and make the iPhones have USB C. I do not want a wireless charging only phone, ALL my devices use USB, its literally just apple iPhones lagging behind everything else.
I would just like to ask something which is better s21 ultra or ip 12 pro max when it comes to camera department
How does one say 70% chance 🤷🏽 just making shit up in their head!
Happy V day
Keep up great work...Really hope Iphone13 well be cheaper in Monthly wise Example: $28.85 or $29.75 make bigger iphone13's $33.29 but guess we well wait an see right
That back cam of iphone 12 pro Are gone we miss that. 😞
Mini led apple watch ?
Thanks for this video 😀
Hey EAP I got a question, what about the regular 12 series? Are the getting 120hz next year or never?
Always on something u can do with an update
this Wazz very good news I enjoyed it 😏!!!👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾💪🏾👌🏾
That plastic case coat like 8 bucks to make
Glad to see you are still alive 😂. Been waiting on this video. You are the real OG🔥🙌🏻
I was willing to buy iPhone 12 pro max but after these amazing features of iPhone 13 series I would wait for iPhone 13  or iPhone 12 S. Thanks EAP.
Stills notch what a flop
Still notch? Nooooo
Date me baby.. i want to be your valentine🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I swear if it actually doesn’t have a port I’m switching
286th
Even the leaks are getting boring 😂😂
I love you man.❤️ #EAP
Ok if apple goes portless with the iPhone, how am i gonna use CarPlay in my car? I dont have wireless CarPlay in my ford or honda
“AirPods 2 Pro” 😂
Yay new MagSafe
Ports sold separately
Really can’t wait for my Rebel case to Be delivered Thank you for making a case that isnt Too big and great protection not to mention the looks completely hands down best Case I’ve ever seen that covers all aspects can’t wait for the sideless Version when that releases 100% getting the rebel series with MagSafe. 👍
I wish I could afford an Iphone. It's very expensive here in India
How’s the coffee shop going? And that plot of land under the bridge interested to know 👍🏽
If portless happens, then what happens to iTunes?
Can't wait to get my case! Just waiting on shipping before I get my hands on it
No port - no buy for me !
Video starts @1:12
They are not doing iphone 13 because it's considered as badluck number
🌚 لما اشتريت جهاز ايفون اكس اس ف 2018 فجاءه وصلنا ل 13 اصبروا شوي
120hz display makes me a buyer this year
That different camera design does look far cleaner to be fair, no charging port is a huge yikes
Gen 2 Rebel 💯🔥
Dude i just got the 12
Sweet waiting for the rebel series 2 mag safe case :)
I'm glad I held out for the iPhone 13.
Ipad mini 6 launch date plzZz❤️❤️❤️
no thanks. not buying until there is no notch and 120hz
Within an hour ticket
Looking forward for the AirPods video! Your info helps when choosing the right time to buy
Thank you for the video! been waiting.
Oh yeah just to let you know I love your cases

Wow 14 minutes ago

GO TO BED 🛌
Why did iPhone skip the number 9?
you can already open the Tesla with an app
Literally just got the 12pro max today and boom this !
I am glad that i saw your channel on my notifications ...... We are glad that you're back
love your videos
Idk why apple thinks they need a thin phone. I’m ok with have a thicker phone as long as it had the features that came with a thicker phone!
*Muslims For Trump*
Why apple not minimize the notch because is so annoying when ylu play a game. I'm just commenting but not have a iPhone hahahaha. Sorry.
they need to make a red 13 pro
Back with the updates my man 😁💯
10:07-Need you with w/wet fingers now!
Yay new video lol
Why would they make the camera aperture dark? Looks like cheap trash.
W
Where the heck have you been
I want this phone sooooo. badly i have an iphone 6
Waiting man
What about iphone se 3
Anything new on Ipad pro 2021?
I’ve been waiting for some more iPhone 13 leaks 🐐🔥 You’re the best bro! ⬆️🙌
I'm literally watching this video at 12:43 a.m. in the morning. I'm not even joking and it says it was uploaded 8 minutes ago why is shipping so early in the morning
If Apple ever goes powerless on the iPhone, I feel as though that would be very detrimental to the company despite having MagSafe. A lot of people really doesn’t wireless charge their phones and I doubt people really sue MagSafe. But I could be wrong 🤷🏾‍♂️ I know I personally won’t buy a port less iPhone
Could someone explain to me why he is so skinny?
Any news on if the battery will be longer than the iPhone 12 series?
These renders keep getting crazier every video!!!
Alguien me podría explicar porque esta tan flaco?
Any word on 12 pro max battery case?
Who uploads this early in the morning
When could we expect a drop test from gen two?
I got the 12 pro max and I am really happy with it. I’ll upgrade to a new one after 4-5 years I guess
Hey!!!! I’m earllyyyy
Already? Fucking hell.
Hahahaha always on sound like copycat
Make video about AppleProRaw.....
Loving the iphone 11 pt3 looks great
Portrait video should’ve been unlocked in a software update the a14 is capable
Wow if they call it the iPhone 12s the regular ones will be called the iPhone 12 s and the iPhone 12s mini and for the pro it would be called the iPhone 12s pro and the iPhone 12s pro max
That's nice😀
Apple
Waiting for the iPhone 13 giveaway 🙈
New ipad?
Bro didn’t the 13 just drop?! 💀 Apparently I am still in year 2020.
Fake
He’s back !
Iphones are soooooo expensive
i have a question will they still keep the  blue colors for the 12S/13?!? i dont want it to be discontinued
I Hope the notch will go away
Do you make cases for android phones as well 🤔 I have a Galaxy S9
Yoyoyo
iPhone 13  let’s go
Curb your leaks?
My cat died today but you made my day.
PLZ GIVE ME A IPHONE 13 PRO MAX PLZZZ
I’ve already been able to unlock my vehicle with my phone for over a year now.
Cool
120hz is so useless... But I’m still upgrading
What was he doing in hiding for so long
Almost 2am. Ready to sleep. But the GOAT has uploaded.
Nice video
13 i just got the iphone 12 lol
Im curious. How exactly will CarPlay work with no port?
they better fuckin increase the battery capacity by A LOT for this model. really disappointed with my 12 Pro Max battery compared to my 11 Pro Max.
Time to switch to Android?
Always On display on iPhone FINALLY been waiting for years!!
I might buy that case for when I get an IPhone 12s
This is THE iPhone to get! Even though most smartphones nowadays have had those same features for a bit already.
Love the sky thing
Thank you for sharing!Hope everybody here becomes successful on YouTube 😊🥰🙏🙏
Still working towards my iPhone 12..
12 still available when 13 is out right?
Wow! Last I was this early this joke was funny
first
IM EARLY AND HORRRNYYYYYYY
Do you think the iphone iphone 13 will be the best in 2021 and I really love your vids and take care😃😎🤩
I might just wait for the 14 or 15 because I just got the 12 and I don’t plan on switching! They’re crazy! They should’ve activated the AOD on the 12 because they do have the tech for it and the phone is capable of being able to do that
My 200$ phone also have Always on display feature 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
