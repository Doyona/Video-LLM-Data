Seedflare does activate 100% of the time for shaymin sky due to serene grace. And I dont think anyone is really running shaymin ground
9:34 Leppa berry
Revival blessing is insane
You kept saying Reflect but I think you meant Counter 😂
6:30 oh ye sweet summer child, if only you knew how child support payments have damned us all...
I feel like Wolf should do a recap on this video.
Wolfe it would be cool if you reacted to this video now. I think your perspective in a lot of your grades will change.
9:32 just found out I'm super powerful
Bro messed up like 75% of these. Like half should be higher and half should be lower😂
Dudunsparce getting an S+ tier move is hilarious, bro went from being essentially a joke/meme pokemon in Gen 2, to somehow being given what might be one of the best Normal Type moves out there. I love my fat snake
Having a psychic that hits twice, gets 2 chances to crit, and breaks sash is BAD?
Annhialape- Use a multihit move with a low damage Pokémon- Use rage fist- Profit-
I think Spicy Extract could work well on an Ally Pokemon whats holding the White Herb, basically a free Swords dance on your mon
Can smeargle use revival blessing
wait, 101 accuracy?
Just in general when doing tier lists it's often helpfull to define each grade (maybe you write it down think about it or even mention it in the video e.g. S tier: This move defines how a Pokemon is used, changes battles or invalidates entire strategies A tier: means people will often take this move it is very reliable or fills a certain niche Well B: Will probably be taken, but not too often reliable or powerfull and unreliable C: usable in rare instances D: can't see anyone using this hast maybe some niche somewhere F: terrible never usable literaly only a downgrade from other moves
But I brought close combat koraidon to EUIC
Twin Beam would be great on a Mon with Technician.
22:22 gay plant
Here after 2 years…I don’t know if anyone has tried this. Most likely but…what if you doodle your partner mon. Do you just get the same ability as the partner? Doodle intimidate and have the 2nd and possibly 3rd intimidate activation….speaking of intimidate , why isnt there a spa version of it? Maybe call it Fluster or something I don’t know   Edit: 11:45  Edit: 12:05  I shouldve waited not even 10 seconds, legit. I actually paused the video and thought about doodle wonderguard but you wouldn’t even be able to hit a shedinja unless neutralizing gas was on the field…then i thought about intimidate, made the og comment the watched not even 10 seconds
Favorite part about Tera Blast is that its type of damage depends on your best stat. Its usually a special move but if you use it on say an Annihilape, it'll become a physical move.
Oh boy that Tera Blast take
i understand rabsca getting revival blessing, but the pikaclone is sitting here going "I AM THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA, THE BEGINNING AND THE END"
I know this was two years ago, stuck on YouTube tho:  Speed max and attack min population bomb on annihilape holding something that lets it hit ghost types (spec glasses? Idr)
Sableyes bst Is a middle finger to everyone who enjoys a cute little gem goblin I mean not even its mega is very good
22:25 I’m sorry GAY PLANT
Revaroom is one of the best pokemon for trick room sweeps because its move in trick room raises speed by 2 stages
6:33 actually it isn't the first ever to hit more than five, the move Beat Up can hit six times
you could use spicy extract on a confused opponent and it would be good
Tinkaton with max attack iv plus swords dance
gigaton hammer zacian in gen 10
WolfeyPLUS reaction to this should happen.
Population bomb is absurd because loaded dice
Wait cant you combo population bomb on a tera anilape to get a 550 base power move
you gotta give last respects a b+ at least, it can go up to i think it was 5050 base power after 100 uses in a row? which obviously is never going to happen organically but it would be insane to see it irl just going through like six hp maxed blisseys or eviochanseys or something
It's crazy how indifferent Wolfey was to Tera Blast, knowing how much it's been used since
Chilly Reception is, ironically, a REALLY funny move. It gives the same vibe as a joke/gag pokemon card. Imagine if they printed a Slowking with an ability that lets you put it back in your hand, but you have to tell a bad joke in order to use the ability.
tera blast c tier aged like milk
*Dondozo
Sure, an attack with 30 power is bad, but you know what's the worst crime of Mortal Spin? It's a physical move exclusive to Glimmora, which has horrible base Attack stats
I really like the ability Contrary so the down side of defense going down two stages along with attack going up two stages is negated, I know is doesnt really change its rating cause I agree its very niche and not really good other wise lol
5:00 I think you might have read that wrong..
6:57 btw you can boost the accuracy of the hit to 99% with Wide Lens, so unless your really unlucky you're always gonna hit
Me catching up on Wolfey vids from 2 years ago Top 3 channels for me rn
It hurts a bit to year him call it "Glee-Ayev" Rush... A "Glaive" or "Gl-Aye-vuh" is a bladed polearm, so it's easy enough to find the pronunciation for.
aqua cutter because they buffed gallade my goat
11:20 so... hes just not going to touch on mortal spin getting rid of entry hazards.... huh...
What if there was an attack that has a secondary effect that say if the enemy Pokémon it hits is the same type as the move it dose super effective damage. So if this move is steel and your and your opponents Pokémon is steel you’ll do super effective damage and get stab too
15:08 Genuine jumps are hearing something similar to Raging Bolt being said on a pre 2024 video
off the bad tera blast C making sure i know this video is 2 years old
Bro could not be more wrong about Tera blast
From the future: Revival Blessing did not matter
i think scovilain signature move will be good with an ally using foul play so il will do so much damage because it counts the attack boost of the target (this is the only way to use this move correctly but it sucks)
Using population bomb on an Annihlape then if it dies reviving it with Pawmot could be insanely broken if each population bomb counts as a different attack.
I think spicy extraact can be used when for example you use it on your teaamate to get aa quick kill or on the target  for a qquick kill also
I thought the video was glitched really bad but my playback speed was on 0.3😅
I’m here to propose a question; in the double legendary format, how many mons would appreciate a cyclizar shed tail? I personally imagine mons like hetran and Lunala, which already have good bulk but also have quad weaknesses, will massively appreciate someone else using Substitute, freeing up a move for the stronger legendaries to exploit. Perhaps you lead incin cyclizar with max speed to give heatran a Sub, then use parting shot to bring cyclizar back out to sack it after you soften  With heatran on the field with sub, an intimidate thrown down, a cyclizar doing chip or setting another sub up for incin or your second legendary, you can do quite a lot of damage while soaking hits with the sub, and with a subbed 4 attack heatran you can do massive damage. Pair with groudon and eruption and you do so much, with so much bulk! The interesting part is that as dragon normal you discourage people from using ground or water type moves that do well vs heatran but if you expect a fighting attack you may want a mon that has ghost secondary typing on your team, but then there aren’t many ghost types that fit into sun teams well…
22:23 "gay plant"
Silk trap: A tier Spidops: below F tier
22:24 GAY PLANT MENTIONED 🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈
seeing tera dragon miraidon in the beginning was so weird
Mortal Spin also removes entry hazards like Spikes, Stealth Rock, or Sticky Web, which would be great if entry hazards were used in competitive. But they don't seem to be. Which is weird, because it seems like Stealth Rock (for example) would really slow a certain annoying FIRE TYPE, Intimidate + U-Turn/Parting Shot user...
When say Reflect and Mirror Coat I think you meant Counter and Mirror Coat for anyone confused.
Pounce being 50 bp is fantastic for Mega-Scizor. Thanks yo technician making it 75 bp.
10:10 that aged poorly, fart forward to now and no one uses it
I was using choice band weavile cuz yippie and i used metronome and it used triple dive which was really funny
I love how panicked we were about revival blessing when it's just terribly mid
I don't understand why some moves, like Silk Trap, have 101% accuracy.
i wanna see what his ranking of moves are now that VGC has had a few years to check was good
I think axe kick gets a lot of benefits on a pokemon that's really tanky, but still hits fairly hard. That way it can take the recoil, stay on the field long enough to cause confusion, and not have to risk lowering its valuable defensive stats to deal high fighting type physical damage.
The fact he says reflect and mirror coat instead of counter and mirror coat 23:51
Pokerouge makes a lot of these way more fun
0:01 "Tiurlet and Violet"? 🚽➕🟣
2 years on rage fist population bomb... yh we have a problem.
23:33 counter not reflect
order up is a lower grade than spidops' signature move... i wonder which one has had more success
bro keeps saying ability XD
You could use spicy extract on your teammate
Bro forgot blood moon
22:22 gay plant
Twin beam is just a worse psychic, psybeam, psyshock, etc...  Except it can break a focus sash and ko a pokemon weak to psychic in the same turn. Who is weak to psychic and likes to run sash? Glimmora. It's also special so it doesn't trigger toxic debris. It hits as hard as psybeam and psyshock but can ko through a sash. How is this bad?  Edit: it's also been proven that rage fist DOES have an upper limit. That limit is 6 times. Still a potential 350 base power for a move is huge especially since you can set it up yourself.
shadow tag salt cure sounds good
Rage Fist Because power builds up every time Annihilape is hit and perfect combination with Bulk Up Electro Drift combination with Hadron Engine Calm Mind and secondary boost if hit on a flying or water type
I’d love to see Wolfe redo this video now that we are 2 years through competitive play
Gleeeee Ave rush
Gay plant played pokemon violet
10:14 salt cure sounds a lot like perish song, though perish song has a counter of 4 while salt cure does damage continuously that will kill in 4-8 turns assuming no other sources of damage and they don't switch out or heal, which perish song is vulnerable to anyways
Where is the update to this list? Lol. Would love to see the hidsight reaction
Don't forget that tera blast does either physical or special damage based on which of the user's stats are higher
I Refuse To Believe That Pokémon Scarlet And Violet Released 2 Years Ago
I think you should also have had two list, one for casual, one for competitive
I wonder if you still stand by these rankings 2yrs later
Doodle + Slaking?
A singer, an entertainer, and a dancer...  ... oh my god, the starter pokemon are CARNIVAL THEMED!!!
Lumina crash sounds like an ability, so I can't judge
so many errors in this video :/  one that you didn't correct: at 12:15 you keep saying Fillet Away reduces the user's HP by a quarter, but it's actually half!
Chilling Water is C-Tier... The background video shows, Chilling Water used on Bisharp... Clearly it is a C-Tier move...
god smeargles gonna be a menace with all these new movies
19:46 Shadow Force too I guess bypasses protect
Sir there appears to be a video in your adds.....
yoo but how manny coments do you remember? like are there any spechail coments you remember ??
why does some moves have 101present acurasy
9:32 I'm sorry great video and all but what did you just call "glaive rush"? It's made up of 2 relatively easy English words 😅
I'm loving how Wolfe is not afraid to admit he was wrong. The various corrections to his understanding found in this video after learning more is a wonderful sight and I wish everyone (myself included) could be that gracious with learning new info. Keep it up, Wolfe!
Just pair 'Spicy extract' with Pokemon having Defiant ability like Kinggambit or Anhilape and boom you have them +6 attack in one turn
Watching this after just watching a video about how a certain ideology was spread on roblox... well, it was certainly a big shift in tone.
Saying mortal spin isn't very good is crazy to me. It's a better version of the move toxic bc it does damage and gets rid of things like leech seed
I feel like doodle can be used with truant or slow start
I'd like a follow up to see how this aged.
Tera Blast got quite a lot of play
Poor year ago Wolfie calling Tera Blast C tier
Mannn, why he gotta throw shade on farigiraf like that, twin beam has some notable things to it, like being able ko through sash, and two hits means twice as likely for a crit. I think it's a fine choice for the mon especially if you pair it with calm mind, or throat spray + hyper voice
My question is...why aren't these games adding many more moves to switch up or add "flavor" to the game.
Use Spicy Extract on Contrary Serperior whilst it uses Leaf Storm
22:59 Tera electric negates this effect. It can make you use it more than once…….
17:05 electrodrift is better than collision course because it gets boosted by miradons ability and collision course is not. (I mean the terrain boosts electrodrift but collision course is fighting type and doesn’t get boosted by The sun)
11:53 i have been sketched and that mf gave regigias an good ability and that is just insane. (I’m not sure if it worked like i remember but i think it gave it a ability from my teams side and i had a Lunala on the field)
Can revival blessing boost the power of Last respects
I think that cloud nine and deltastream should also remove terrains
I dont know why people dont use kings rock + population bomb that would flinch so much
Does multi-hit moves affect rage fist?
Why is silk 101%??
why does he say ability instead of attack
22:25 ga plant
20:58 Bruh, I misread this as “every time the TARGET gets hit.” That would have been LUDICROUSLY BUSTED.
You said ability when all of them are moves
11:19 that makes sense cuz you never see hazards in VGC. In singles where it’s 6v6 hazards are way more common, which essentially makes this move a poison type rapid spin
22:22 Gay Plant
How does silk trap have 101% acc
how come some moves have 101% accuracy?
where my ice hammer at
8:45 damn I wasn’t subbed
I save Tera Blast for a coverage move that my Pokémon can’t learn a damaging move of that type.
Did I see copperajah using spin out
He called dondozo dodonzo sevral times
Bro rage fist and population bomb
10:35 The water/steel pokemon getting evaporated with this move
Na last respect scarf max speed and attack Tera ghost insane B is criminal
Tinkaton should have been the pseudo legendary for this generation
Battle bond incinaroar
doodle regigigas
spicy exract is great with a mirror herb
last respects actually gets to like 1000 bp if you die 100 times in a battle
lol that Order Up grade
Gigaton hammer incineroar
i disagree on spicy extract, i think its possible to use in doubles, maybe depending on the ally pokemons ability it could be less riskier or have more benefits. is it weird id like to see scovillain a bit more??
Wolfe: can pronounce Grafaiai Also Wolfe: can’t pronounce Glaive
I kinda like how they are moving towards each pokemon getting a signature move. Not only allows for widely spread moves to be nerfed in case it's needed, it let's pokemon fill a niche that, considering we got more than 1k pokemons, is rly good. It can also means more underwelming mons can be made better if they get a unique move, like the Lake Trio or Meganium (give her an Grass-type Aurora Veil)
Not to mention shedinja will love having a sub when it switches in on smogon 18:05
tera starstorm...
About Gigaton Hammer being countered by protect, you could always just… wait. It not being available consecutively doesn’t mean you have to click it every odd turn order. I dunno if that’s practical for tinkaton, but yeah.
I still think bitter blade should have been S tier, just because of how good ceraluge is
Personally I feel tera blast should not require terastalization, and just match your tera type. It's be a better hidden power.
If Quaquaval gets a ko with aqua step and has its hidden ability it's getting a dragon dance in addition to the ko
101% on Silk trap?
10:04 they really missed an opportunity to give Revival Blessing to Ho-oh
Half of this video is corrections
This is so funny watching this after SV has wrapped, never have I seen someone be so wrong 💀
Btw "Glaive Rush" is pronouced Glayve
This aged kinda poorly, since tera blast was able to give pokemon the ability to fully use their stats and type. Best example would be salamence, since it can get a good flying type move now
Tera normal Tera blast
revival blessing + leppa berry is the bane of my existence
22:25 "gay plant" lmao
The thing is in showdown if u give a revival blesssing Pokémon leppa berry your aloud to use it again lol
Order Up sounds like Game Freak was thinking of using a Calyrex-like mechanic for a "Dragon Rider" Pokemon. (I'm all for a move that allows little Pokemon to jump on bigger ones and become a combined beast.)
You missed upper hand (unless that wasn't introduced in this gen or was introduced after the video.)
Leppa berry on revival blessing lets you use it twice.
Imagine using doodle on shedninja
Am I the only one not seeing upper hand here? It’s a really good incineroar counter in my opinion
scandalous how wolf doesnt mention king shield at 0:59
22:21
I really love the ludo-narrative going on with Tinkaton and Gigaton Hammer.  Like yes, it's a good move and balanced appropriately, but think about what its specific mechanics reflect what it represents in the game's world:  Gigaton Hammer hits _really_ hard, as you might expect from just looking at the object it represents -- Tinkaton's massive freaking hammer.  But Tinkaton's attack stat _isn't_ high, meaning the hammer is specifically represented by the move Gigaton Hammer, and _everything else_ that Tinkaton can do is represented by its otherwise mediocre offenses.  Furthermore, the since the move can't be used consecutively, it's like the hammer is difficult to wield... which makes sense. (Look at it!)  But it's not like Hyper Beam or Giga Impact, which take so much effort that the user has to rest for a turn. No, Tinktaton's hammer is tough for it to wield, but _only_ the hammer. It doesn't _exhaust_ itself with a hammer swing -- it just takes time to maneuver it for another strike. In the meantime, Tinkaton can do other things, but its low raw offense represents that it's not going to be making *that* much of an impact without using its hammer.  So Tinkaton, as far as I know, is the most drastic example of a Pokemon whose design representation is split significantly between its stats and its signature move, all elegantly integrated as balance restrictions.  Its stats?  Not that big, because Tinkaton is just a lil pink thing.  Its Hammer move?  _Big,_ because big hammer, and _slow_ be because... big hammer.  As a cherry on top, as far as I know, Gigaton Hammer is the first move that can't be used twice in a row as a specific restriction. I mean, there are other moves that themselves take 2 turns (either by charge-up or by recharge), moves that are _unwise_ to use consecutively, and a handful whose more specific restrictions imply that it can't be used twice in a row (like Steel Roller, which requires terrain and destroys it)... but only Gigaton Hammer _specifically_ says "you can't use this twice in a row".  So they added an entirely new type of restriction _just_ to balance Gigaton Hammer in a way that also makes sense for what it represents in Tink's design!
Sad we didn’t get a follow up for the DLC
"But only X can learn it so we'll never see it" **Smeargle snickering**
Thanks
23:22 I wish I could see his reaction to Ursaluna-B getting Blood Moon
Forcing manual switches is always good
Last respect at B tier ?? It is already super strong after toe deaths and pretty nice after just one death and there aren’t many physical ghost type moves
Double Shock can be used after you lose the electric type, it just won’t have STAB.
I’d argue the worst damage is 70 because you can’t make use of technician, and it’s still very low (I guess 61 would be worse, but maybe a few attacks exist that are between 60 and 70 power) and once an attack reaches under 40 power unless it’s multi attack, then even technician isn’t even enough. I bring this up for the 50 power bug and grass moves for Pokémon like Scyther for example
Pairing Annihilape with someone who can hit him with a Multihit move is broken since each hit counts as one hit meaning a 5 hit bullet seed can increase rage fist up to 300 power
I just realized, seamgrle can use revival blessing, follow me, spore, and helping hand.
"you cant do double damage next turn if you dont have a next turn"    -me after getting baxcalibur
10:00 funny how it was never really used
Oh shit i thought shed tail was a bad gimmick move too, so cool that the pokemon that learn it are designed around it!
Oh shit wait I thought the treasures of ruin were dlc mons, I didn't know they were in the base game, that is so cool!
I just thought "a move that can revive would be cool, that would also make that ghost move stronger, sad there isn't something like that" BUT IT ACTUALLY EXISTS? HOLY SHIT!
I thought population bomb was aws, but that mon gets TECHNICAN? that's crazy!
Imagine if spicy extract actually worked like that, broken ass move!
Damn espathra's kinda nuts!
I thought tera blast was rlly good lol
Man I love this game!
Wolfey: Dondozo is not a dragon type.  Terastilization: Am I a joke to you?
spicy extract on a defiant pokemon would be nuts
Correction he said ability a lot of times insted of moves
Personal thoughts, i used farigiraf for part of my main playthrough and had twinbeam just to break sturdy. I'm no competitive player by any means and admit it's mid but it came in handy occasionally and farigiraf is admittedly a setup mon for my team.
You can use mortal spin on things that have I think it’s clear body so they can’t be poisoned
Why did you say glaive like that 😭
Revival Blessing was actually a huge nothing-burger due to the tempo loss. Womp womp.
Salt cure + shadow tag ☠
I wonder how much your opinions on these moves have changed with time, would be an interesting video
I knew Rabsca could use Revival Blessing, but I forgot Pawmot could as well. I was like “Why Pawmot?” until I rememebred that Pawmot is themed after a defibrilator.
Garganacl, Garganacl, Garganacl, Tyranitar, Rabsca, and Greavard Would be BROKEN EDIT: Annihlape Could Work With Rage Fist And Instead of Tyranitar, Would be Another Rabsca.
@9:26 "I'm givin GleeAve rush a... " bro.. I love your content, and as a pokemaniac..  IT'S GLAIVE RUSH.. Lol. Glaive is pronounced like glacier but with a V, and without an R. It's new after the weapon called, the Glaive.. 😂
If glaive rush ever gets too popular it may give competetive players a reason to bring pokemon with one hit KO moves, and then use other pokemon to bait the move and pivot into your fissure user etc.
you can spam double shock with electric tera
Uhh year kate but silk trap doesn’t block status moves, its not like normal protect
⬛
I’m sorry. Terrastalization looks so dumb, combined with the AWFUL release of S&V and the mid Pokémon designs, I’m out. I like the comp scene still, I just think Terra is an awful gimmick…
11:06 mortal spin is different rapid spin, so it removes stuff like spikes and stealth rock too
I've been going back and watching your old videos.. I really like your pokemon stuff
Spicy extract lowers the opposing opponent's defense while raising their attack. Clearly shown in the video
Actually, spicy extract has a niche use. On special attacking pokemon (articuno, calyrex, regieleki etc.) These pokemon most likely carry full special attack builds, which makes their attack useless. This niche allows scovillain to lower the defense of these pokemons with basically no drawback.
Mortal spin is just a better rapid spin?
Grass is a plant with narrow leaves growing from the base. A common kind of grass is used to cover the ground in a lawn and other places. Grass gets water from the roots in the ground. Grass is usually pigmented with the colour ‘green’. Grasses are monocotyledon, herbaceous plants.  The grasses include the "grass", of the family Poaceae (also called Gramineae). Also sometimes it is used to include the sedges (Cyperaceae) and the rushes (Juncaceae). These three families are not closely related but belong to different clades in the order Poales. They are similar adaptations to a common life-style.  The true grasses include cereals, bamboo and the grasses of lawns (turf) and grassland. Uses for graminoids include food (as grain, sprouted grain, shoots or rhizomes), drink (beer, whisky), pasture for livestock, thatching thatch, paper, fuel, clothing, insulation, construction, sports turf, basket weaving and many others.  Many grasses are short, but some grasses, like bamboo can grow very tall. Plants from the grass family can grow in many places, even if they are very cold or very dry. Several other plants that look similar but are not members of the grass family are also sometimes called grass; these include rushes, reeds, papyrus, and water chestnut.  Grasses are an important food for many animals, like deer, buffalo, cattle, mice, grasshoppers, caterpillars, and many other grazers. Unlike other plants, grasses grow from the bottom, so when animals eat grass they usually do not destroy the part that grows. Without grass, dirt can wash away into rivers (erosion). Graminoids include some of the most versatile plant life-forms. They became widespread toward the end of the Cretaceous. Fossilized dinosaur dung (coprolites) have been found containing grass phytoliths (silica stones inside grass leaves). Grasses have adapted to conditions in lush rain forests, dry deserts, cold mountains and even intertidal habitats, and are now the most widespread plant type. Grass is a valuable source of food and energy for many animals.Lawn grass is often planted on sports fields and in the area around a building. Sometimes chemicals and water is used to help lawns to grow.  People have used grasses for a long time. People eat parts of grasses. Corn, wheat, barley, oats, rice and millet are cereals, common grains whose seeds are used for food and to make alcohol such as beer.  Sugar comes from sugar cane, which is also a plant in the grass family. People have grown grasses as food for farm animals for about 4,000 years. People use bamboo to build houses, fences, furniture and other things. Grass plants can also be used as fuel, to cover roofs, and to weave baskets. n English, the word "grass" appears in several phrases. For example: "The grass is always greener on the other side" means "people are never happy with what they have and want something else." "Don't let the grass grow under your feet" means "Do something". "A snake in the grass" is about a person that will not be honest and will trick others.  Grass is sometimes used as a slang term for cannabis (also called pot, weed, or marijuana) The Grass type (Japanese: くさタイプ Grass type) is one of the eighteen types. Prior to changes in Generation IV, all damaging Grass-type moves were special, but they may now also be physical depending on the attack. Grass-type Pokémon are immune to Leech Seed. Grass-type Pokémon are immune to Leech Seed Starting in Generation VI, Grass-type Pokémon are immune to powder and spore moves and Effect Spore.Grass types are tied with Rock in having the most weaknesses out of all types with five. Since Generation I, a particular asset of Grass types is being the only type that is immune to Leech Seed. As of Generation VI, Grass-type Pokémon are also immune to powder and spore moves, such as Sleep Powder and Stun Spore. Additionally, Grass Pokémon are the only ones affected by Rototiller and Flower Shield. Those moves raise both attack stats or the physical Defense stat, respectively, when used. Forest's Curse adds the Grass type to the target's types. Grass-type attacks are resisted by seven types, so they're tied with Bug as the most resisted type. Those resistant types are best covered by Rock and Ground. As of Generation VI, Dark and Ghost have neutral matchups against every type that resists Grass. When Grassy Terrain is in the effect, the power of Grass-type moves is increased by 30% (50% prior to Generation VIII) if the user is on the ground.  Contest properties In contests, Grass-type moves are typically Clever moves, but can also be any of the other four contest conditions. As of Generation VIII, there are 112 Grass-type Pokémon or 12.27% of all Pokémon (counting those that are Grass-type in at least one of their forms), making it the third most common type after Normal and before Flying.  A Pokémon with Protean or Libero will become a Grass-type Pokémon if it uses a Grass-type move. A Pokémon with Color Change, Imposter, Mimicry, RKS System, or Multitype will become a Grass-type Pokémon if (respectively) it is hit with a Grass-type move, is sent out against a Grass-type opponent, if the terrain is grassy, if it is holding a Grass Memory, or if it is holding a Meadow Plate or Grassium Z. Since Generation VI, Grass-type Pokémon are also immune to Effect Spore; Only Grass-type Pokémon can have these Abilities. This does not include signature Abilities.Due to the decreased amount of types in the TCG, Grass generally adopts all Bug-type Pokémon under its typing. It also adopted Poison-type Pokémon prior to the Diamond & Pearl set, after which they were moved to Psychic. Similar to the games, Grass-type Pokémon in the TCG are generally weak to Fire and resist Water.  Grass-type Pokémon are strong against Fighting and Water Pokémon, whilst Metal Pokémon resisted it until the EX Power Keepers expansion set. Generation V introduced the most Grass-type Pokémon of any generation, with 21 (including Rotom's Mow form), and Generation VI introduced the fewest Grass-type Pokémon, with nine. Generation I introduced the most Grass-type moves of any generation, with 10, and Generation II introduced the fewest Grass-type moves, with three.  The Grass type and/or Pokémon of the type have been referred to using the term "plant" instead on some occasions: In the English Generation I games, the Gym guide in Cerulean Gym refers to Pokémon of the Grass type as "plant Pokémon". In the English versions of Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, he instead mentions "Grass-type Pokémon". In the Japanese versions of the Generation I games and FireRed and LeafGreen, he mentions the Grass type itself, calling it the "Plant type" (Japanese: しょくぶつタイプ). Another reference to "plant Pokémon" (Japanese: しょくぶつポケモン) is made by Professor Oak in the Japanese Pokémon Red, Green, and Blue, and international Pokémon Red and Blue, classifying Bulbasaur as such when the player is about to choose it as their starter. This is also the case in the Japanese versions of Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen; in contrast, he calls it the "grass Pokémon" in the English versions. This same reference is also used in the first episode of Pokémon Origins.  In multiple languages, such as French and German, the Grass type is translated as the Plant type. The Turkish dub of the anime occasionally refers to "Grass type" as "Plant type". The Grass type has the most Pokémon that evolve by Evolution stones, with a total of 11. It is also the type that can utilize the most stones, having at least one Pokémon that can evolve via the Leaf Stone, Sun Stone, Water Stone, and Shiny Stone.The Grass type is the only type to have more than one HP-draining move, having five of them. Grass-type attacks deal doubly super-effective damage to the most Pokémon of all types. Grass-type attacks are super effective against the three types that Fire types are weak to. Fire is the only type that hasn't been paired with Grass. In Tree's a Crowd, Brock states that Grass-type Pokémon resist Electric-type moves due to being able to diffuse the electricity into trees and the ground. He also explains that if Grass types are in the air, they cannot diffuse the electricity from Electric attacks, thereby dealing normally effective damage.  Now that you have read this much about grass, maybe you should go and touch some...
What if you use doodle to swap slaking ability
Could be nice to see an update video on this topic
can someone explain the 101% acc on spicy extract ? i dont know why this is a thing
1:06 101 ACCURACY???
"This is glyave rush"  wtf
You missed iron valiant’s signature move: Spirit Break
New Pokémon is wack. Never been less excited for a Pokémon game. I guess I’m just done with the franchise. I tried gen 8 and hated the handholding and new mechanics and the effing power creep and fairy still being broken. Only got worse in gen 9. Dang man 20 years of Pokémon. It feels like a breakup or a divorce lol.
e
Funny watching this over a year later and seeing how wildly different the rankings would be now. Revival Blessing is maybe C in vgc. I mean if Ho-oh got it it'd be decent in Reg G but that's not the case unfortunately.
Bro why is Silk Trap A? When's the last time anyone used a Spidops?
Population bomb, plus kings rock  = no move cause flinch
23:02 you can tera electric to keep using that move ik im a year late
101%? Glaive is said like clay. 11:20 Found the VGC player. Can you use Tera Electric to use Double Shock twice? 23:35 Counter.
I was trying to remember for a moment why I thought spicy extract wasn’t a good choice. Thanks for the correction😂
sleepin on trailblaze. had a zacian do that after an sd ant it was wraps.
8:56 gliave rush??? Its GLAIVE rush
THE DISRESPECT TO MORTALSPIN IS CRAZY. IT IS LITERALLY MORTAL SPIN BUT INSTEAD GIVES THE OPPONENT A TICKING TIME BOMB. AND WITH TOXIC SPIKES IT HURTS THINGS THAT SWITCH IN. IF THERE IS HEAVY DUTY BOOTS RAPID SPIN JUST MORTAL SPIN IT BACK AND SET UP TOXIC SPIKES AGAIN. YOU CAN ALSO POISON POISON TYPES WITH CORROSION
The move description of Chilly Reception makes me think of someone...
Basculegion can also learn last respects
Fun fact:if u want to know what Pokémon u want to Terastalize it’s umbreon but turn it into fire or poison,fire can counter umbreon's only weakness that it can’t counter,poison if u are a an evil person cuz it could poison your opponent so game freak made a mistake by bringing terastalization cuz umbreon used to be the staller mon
more cut ins and sub begging plz. What a clown.
for me a casual player revival blessing is just a revive item which is 2000 poke dollars
Why do people keep forgetting mah Boi hoopa 😢
Beat up Maushold + Annihilape Rage fist Choice Band = ☠️
Ok I feel targeted, I used a lot of new Pokémon on my play through (I think meowscarada, pawmot, brambleghast, farigaraf, rabscaba, and celuedge and for my starter, farigiraf, and celuedge (who is my new favorite and I made it big root for extra heals) I used there new signature moves (and I didn’t realize for a little while that psychic is twin beam but better)
Rage Fist caps at 300 base power.
What’s the song at 9:50
Apparently reflect and mirror coat are similar moves 😂 23:36
Population bomb with loaded dice:
Who else thought Wolfey made a mistake again a third time but it was just a sub plug
Bro last respects is the most broken move in the game
Shed tail is broken AF, could easily swipe a whole team when combined with a booster energy and if necessary tera on iron valliant or great tusk.
There’s a high pitch hum throughout the video, comes in and out idk why
Running population bomb with loaded dice has to be one of my favorite mini-gimmicks, even just in single player
Twin beam beats sash, could be good to use.
Watching this after a year from an evaluating point of view... Should do a review with this video and take the Mon rating and ability rating along with it. After indigo disk settled a bit in the current meta.
Gigaton hammer 🔨🔨🔨
Correction. Comeuppance is god awful. The pokemon that its given to are quite speedy and, unlike netal burst i think, it doesnt get that minus one priority, making it pretty much useless
Normally I manage to give tinkaton huge power with skill swap and sweep
"If Volcarona got Torch Song, it would absolutely be broken."  Fiery Dance is literally the exact same as Torch Song in every way except name. And it's Volcarona's signature move.
Bro imagine using doodle with slacking or regigigas as ur partner
Axe kick in duble with hydraple is great
18:37 whenever u use this move it tells the opponent that u r using it. Like it lets them know early.
22:22 Nyeh heh heh..... Gay Plant lol
I'm watching this after that one video where he used revival blessing 7 times in one battle
im from the future.. no one uses revival blesing
My man mortal spin ALWAYS poisons thats INSANE my man is in drugs or something
only the goats noticed the pokemon pokemon conquest bgm
Leppa berry revival blessing, 2 revives for the price of 1
Chilling water is such a weird move. It's TM only. The expected water and ice types learn it, but then it's also given to Ambipom and Gumshoos.
????? Why do so many moves have 101 accuracy? He says "ability" like 1000 times
Meanwhile in Pokémon Showdown Adds STABmons game mode
Spicy extract can be good if combined with swagger.
Soak + salt cure + arena trap/shadow tag
Collision course and electro drift is actually a 1.3333333333333 times boost to the attack of super effective similar to the buff of protosynthesis
Imagine you throw in Garchomp and Grafaiai and your opponent throws in Huge Power Azumarill😳
Re
Wolfe thought wrong  Tera blast is everywhere
what's the easierst way to boost moushold's population bomb accuracy to 100%?
Ain't no way blud called Tera Blast C Tier 💀
Can someone pls tell me why some attacks on the video has the accuracy over 100%?
Looking back on this and laughing at tera blast being c tier
moxie quaqauval with choice band and aqua step 0_0
Leppa berry revival blessing,
22:23 bruh who tf is named “gay plant” 💀💀💀
You could make salt cure a monstrous move  if paired with a pokemon with shadow tag or mean look.
Doodle + slacking equals death for doubles
@8:55 as someone who plays bloons tower defence, thats definitley not how you pronounce glaive lol
where did you get the pokemon moves description move accuracy and PP on a card like slide? its cool
How the fuck does a “professional competitive pokemon” player get so much shit wrong from move names, effects, pokemon names, pronunciation, and everything in between
6:44 the first move that can hit more than 5 times is Beat Up
Tera blast S tier now
Whoever cut your hair here needs to be locked up in a  asylum
Spicy extract can work in doubles if your scovillain’s partner knows swagger. If the Pokémon hit by spicy extract hits itself in confusion, it will *HURT.*
I think the mouse pokemon has skill link so it always hits 10 times but it's a normal type move so who knows
put wide lens on maushold
he got spicy extract a bit wrong.
Hey Wolfey, just a heads up there's at least one more mon who learns last repects in scarlet and violet: Basculegion
Trailblaze and pounce are actually p good in singles especially on Pokémon with technician who tend to struggle with speed, like scizor
bruh how does silk trp have a 101% accuracy😭😭
You forgot Tidy Up and Snowscape. ^^;
In the beginning, how would it compare to obstruct, obstagoon's extra effect protect
flower trick isn’t fair
101% Accuracy?
2:14 Bulbapedia says the recoil is 50% of max HP, not 25%
Fun fact about population bomb: If your moushold has the specific ability techniciann it boosts the power of any attack by 50% if its power is below a certain amount making population bomb actually go up into the range or 30-300 instead.  While its still inconsistent since it can hit way more times than normal multi hit moves theres a lower chance of getting a low roll and even then it reaches decent power even in those low rolls if you do the math. Anything 3 hits and above is what you should hope for in the very least at hitting 3 times would mean 90 power bare minimum and since you definitely dont want 60 power or 30 youll get good rolls 8/10 most of the time since the 2/10 are 1 and 2 rolls which you DEFINITELY dont want the higher rolls are more likely with only a 20% chance of being a bad roll
Mortal spin is a great way to poison bith of the opponents pokemon
Don't multi-hit moves break sash?
Quack ah vahl*
mortal spin should've been on Revavroom. change my mind
MAKE IT RAIN + NASTEY PLOT
Whats up with the 101% accuracy?
this video aged like milk
What if you taught something like kingambit mimic and turned mimic into gigaton hammer
This video aged well 😂
Salt Cure take didn't age well. lol (at least in singles)
I’ve never heard of comeuppance before this wow
Would spicy extract partner with a defiant Pokemon? Double attack boost
Had a buddy use doodle with a slaking as his partner. It became a slight problem
If Spicy Extract actually worked like that it would be the strongest move in the game 😂
when i tera'd my pawmot into an electric type, i could use double shock more than once in a row, so i think that makes it much better
I like all the signature moves we have now
These moves are too op, so much power creep
Population bomb is the signature move of the US presidents.
10:03 they found out ways to essentially make it infinite sooooooooo yeah
Doodle Wonderguard lol Also switch into Annihilape against a Maushold.... go go rage fist!
7:28 throw on a king's rock and you pretty much auto win gg
He keeps saying the signature ability instead of signature attack
He missed the fact that double shock is much stronger because you can use it as many times as you want when terrastylized as an electric type
Question, a pokemon ko'ed revived and ko'ed again, does that give a counter to last respect?
“Population bomb is the first move to hit more than 5 times”  Uh, no. Beat up.
population bomb wasn't the first one to do more than 5 hits beat up dous 6
I like Tinkaton and Gigaton Hammer. I hope Tinkaton is in the next gen and they give it a buff coz she deserves to be a menace.
The description of chilly reception is hilarious. Didn't know slowking could talk
Population bomb is pretty strong, but since it’s a contact move it’s pretty easy to cheese with rough skin/iron barbs or a rocky helmet item. Since that’s really the only thing people use maushold for it’e pretty easy to predict too
This list needs to be updated
Thank goodness smeargle isnt in this game cause OH BOY, there are a lot of great moves.
Spicy extract can be useful in terms of it's exchangability as a pokemon with a low def but high atk would lose less then it gains and vice versa it's advantage is you don't need to have the pokemon you wanna setup to preform the setup move itself
It's funny that revival blessing has an accuracy of 101
I hate the way he pronounces “Glaive”
All fun and games until your opponent uses revival blessing more than once because of a Berry + recycle
Where is Hyper Drill, the signature move of Dudunsparce?
20:37 Steven's Decisive Battle theme. Very nice choice of music. It truly rocks.
Lumina Crash is what luster purge wishes it was.
To understand the power of torch song just think about the fact that power up punch is the same but with half power
"Gleeave rush" xD
This video is a huge miss.
Mortal Spin also removes entry hazards.
22:28 Best plant online
How good are the moves that were removed from Scarlet and Violet is a better question.
Skeledirge can learn overheat and torch song. The bad part about Overheat is it lowers your Sp.Atk but Torch song raises it. And Overhear has 120 base attack.
Salt cure is honestly one of the most annoying moves to deal with because the pokemon it's put on is hard to take out and that damage will add up on top of rocks, poison, burns, spikes, as well as Garganacl just attacking you while you're taking damage. Every turn you switch out to avoid salt cure damage is a turn for it to iron defense or curse or possible knockouts. In doubles it's not as good but in singles it can shut down pokemon that don't want to be taking that damage from coming in and punishes switching with good synergy with hazards as well as forcing switches which allows setting up.
I'm pretty sure Aqua Cutter is a gen 5 move that the Oshawott line learned so it's not a new move.
why does silk trap have 101% acuraccy
Glee-ave rush 😂
Spidops signature move silk trap can also help to set up sticky web if you weren’t already faster 1:24
This has already aged horribly and it's only been 4 months
Kowtow Cleave, Mortal Spin, Salt Cure, Glaive Rush, Make it Rain (and Shed Tail, but now banned) are defining the current metagame  Raging bull being able to break screens has also seen some use, especially in draft league  Also spicy extract is super useful in tera raids
i feel like hyper drill would be balanced if it was a 50/50 move
Too bad you didn't grade trailblaze well, because it's making guts heracross super scary!
10:03 this gave me that Brawl "Actual" Meta Knight vibe with the SSS tier iirc
Expanding force
When the legendary move is in the same tier as a starter move
why are some moves shown to have 101% accuracy?
22:27 gay plant
1milion Baby
1M SUBSCRIBERS!!! YAY :)!!!
No wave crash
23:34 minor correction its counter and mirror coat not reflect and mirror coat
Plot twist: Wolfey’s videos end up shaping the meta according to his ranking videos and he ends up preparing his team accordingly
Revival blessing scares me.
Dying that dunsparce finally gets an evo and it just gets longer AND gets an op move
if you have a pawmot or a rabsca in your party and use revival blessing, and then if the pawmot/rabsca dies as well as the recipient of the revival blessing, does the power of last respects still go up?
Correction about Flower Trick: it’s even stronger.  It. Never. Misses. A base 70, effectively base 105 power attack that never misses and is given STAB. Add on a choice band and/or become Tera!Grass and it becomes even stronger
I wish we had another Pokemon game where the entire game is double battles Like Pokemon Coliseum. Having 2v2 really adds a lot more depth to the game.
Did you not think slaking and grafieye
If your oppoment uses slaking with their ally having doodle...
What happened to wideos?? I don't wanna watch a video
Mortal spin is actually one of my favorites.
Wolfe from the future: salt cure is life.
Trail blaze is basically flame charge but a grass type move
I under stand with axe kick since I was playing this game and the target pokemon used axe kick and as a result it fainted from the recoil
as soeone who has been playing vgc on pokemon showdown for 2 years i can safely say i think revival blessing should be banned, it can lead to some crazy counterplay  i think the best way of balancing it is making it so you cant use it on your uber or just banning the move alltogether
6:30 Beat Up: Am I a joke to you?
22:25 Gay Plant
Wouldn't the current haze-ey meta make moves like torch song worse and moves like rage fist better?
Tink’s attack stat should not be under 100.
This is gle-ave rush 8:56 😂
With hidden ability dragon Tera sylveon, I like Tera blast at A tier. Just opinion tho
What if you use population bomb with rage fist?
Rage Fist + Population Bomb = 550 power turn 1 attack?
I'm imagining switching an annihilape into an accuracy boosted population bomb for rage fist now.
Medacham, pure power, skill swap, gigaton hammer.
Silk trap your own Pokémon for trick room team
Twin Beam under either Tera Psychic or Technician(if?) Becomes 60BP which makes it hit as a 120BP move, better than psychic
Does the editor make the icons for the moves themselves? like at 0:21
23:45 I think you mean Counter and not "Reflect".
Just saying that Doodle is OP and broken you can change the ability of a Mon like Slacking to not have Truant.
huge power slaking or any physical attacker cuz of doodle is op
In my violet playthrough, I used a Toxapex with merciless, venoshock, 252 sp. Attack EVs and baneful bunker, and along with recover, this pokemon became an actual beast, being able to deal massive damage, recover if low, and toxic stall the opponent when combined with toxic spikes. So yeah. In my experience, baneful bunker > silk trap
is it just me or is flower trick not here?
Why didn't they add a physical terra blast, like maybe Terra Bash with the same effects and power as Terra Blast
I think last respects works in a kinda "final stand" build if that makes any sense. like, no matter what, never pull that pokemon out unless all others are fainted and it kinda acts as a possible turning point  I don't know, though. complete newbie to the VGC metagame
Lumina Crash put the fear of PokeGod in me during my playthrough, and to this day I fear the beast who weilds it.
Do you plan to do a ranking list for all moves ever?
I think that you got a bit confused with spicy extract . The enemy is at -2 defense, with is good for Scovillain , but also gets at +2 attack.  It is - Oh wait you noticed your mistake . Fine then , I'll go find someone else to correct.
Raging bull also uses whatever tera type you turn into as it type to atk
Question for chat: if you have an espathra with opportunist in a double battle and your second Pokemon uses swagger, would that make opportunist trigger?
I love how you dunked on twin beam, but little cup is terrified of it.
8:56 It's not pronounced "Glia-ve" but "Glay-ve"
Give population bomb user scrappy and hit anihalape (yeah, too many mistakes). Boom! You have 500 base power move
Looking forward to seeing people replace truant on their partner slaking.
Im scared of aqua step, pair that with moxie quaquaval and you got yourself a sweeper
On Quaquaval.  Plz use this set and comment back me if its good  1. Aqua Step 2. Swords Dance 3. Drain Punch 4. U-Turn.     220 Def.  220 S def The rest in atk
You can use Double Shock multiple times if you are running Terra Electric. Being Terrastalized makes it so that you never lose the time you've terra'd into.
you said Population Bomb is the first move that can hit more than 5 times, but doesn't Beat Up hits up to 6 times?
bro just the "Gay-Plant trade marked" during the talk on bitter blade is hilarious
"ruination is just a retextured natures madness" Super fang: Am i a joke to you
Does Doodle work with tatsugiri's commander ability?
can you use doodle on tatsugiri and then enter dondozo's mouth with the pokemon you are using
Revival blessing can be copycatted
Mortal Spin is a good move in Singles since it is a better Rapid Spin that also poisons.
9:42,12:17,13:00,13:25,17:24  ,18:15 101% accuracy?
Salt cure + Shadow Tag
Wait doodle and slacking are going to go insane
10:43 you're wrong, and thankfully that's what you hoped. it's a really good move in Smogon singles because it pressures so many switches as garganacl is gargantuanly bulky.
No way, last respects is S for sure
bro give maushold zoom lens and technician and boom, your winning all your matches
Toxic + Salt cure = double poison
Holy crap imagine mega sable eye + toxapex regenerate + slowpoke chilling reception (regenerate) stall with 2 revival blessings
Hm yes  Reflect and Mirror Coat
Me as a not native english speaker, you talk a little too fast. Put the speed in 0.75x to understand well what you were saying :p
I fought my sister on showdown the other day and she ran a revival blessing and leppa berry and I wanted to cry
Tera blast is not so hidden power
Little known disturbing fact: Gorebyss can learn shell smash
wtf is 101% acc
8:56 I have no words
4:08 dondozo gets stab for order up if a tatsugiri is in its mouth.
What about ice hammer?
Maybe revival blessing should have the drawback of the user having to sacrifice some of their HP to use it.
"Population Bomb is the first move that can hit more than 5 times" Beat up can hit 6 times.
A trick i used in my playthrough: give skeledirge a throat spray to hold and torch song becomes a 80 bp fire move that sharply boosts special attack. (once)
Revival blessing with leppa berry
im confused as to why revival blessing is so broken. like unless youre doing a nuzlocke or a no items playthrough, just use a revive
So what do you have to say about the fact that an infinite revival team has been discovered? Old news, I know, but it's a thing!
Fillet away takes 50 percent health, you literally show it happening lol
Sorry but Wolfe from the future interrupting the video makes it so difficult to focus on the video and actually enjoy it
22:23 Gay Plant 🗿
Annihalpe with rage fist and paired with bulk up would be really dangerous
Doodle alongside slaking im so excited
New subscriber here! Great and informative video's man, keep it up!
4:12 Wait...HOW do you get Tatsugiri into Dodonzo's mouth? WTF?
22:27 Gay Plant lmao
People who have revival blessing using it to revive their strongest pokemon  Edit: torch song is OP. You set up your skeledirge while chaining the move, only to use a high special attack move to destroy
When I get the chance, I'm trying Grafaifai with Slaking in doubles.
Never knew that comeuppance existed
Glee-ayve? lol
Population Bomb + Loaded Dice = every non-resist/immune dies.
Gay plant TM lmao 22:25
Axe Kick feels like a combination of Dynamic Punch and High Jump Kick.  Glaive Rush… dear god, Hassel…  Mortal Spin may not be good offensively, but defensively could do pretty well, especially since it removes binding moves which can already be annoying to deal with on their own, PLUS poisons the target, which in itself is pretty good since you can follow up with Venoshock which does double the damage if the target is poisoned.  Aqua Step is basically a better Water-Type Flame Charge.  Twin Beam may be a base 40, but since it hits twice, it’s technically a base 80 in that instance.
I respect the pokemon conquest music hard
Gave last respects a B, that got greaveyard banned to ubers. Sand rush last respects can sweep teams
I dont know if anybody has talked about it, but revival blessing can be called by sleep talk, which mean with a little of luck, you can actually revive a bunch of times
So... about that Hyper Drill... Larry's Dudunspace has it, along with Drill Run for coverage and Glare for stalling. Game Freak didn't miss with this game.
22:23 gay plant
Regigigas doodle would be amazing
1:06 101%
salt cure + dugtrio arena trap could be a good strat
"signature ability"
Imagine Zacian Crowned with gigaton hammer 💀
can we just appreciate how many times wolfey has called a move an ability
Question does tera blast count as a physical attack if the attacker has higher attack?
(>MAKIN' A LIST OF 101% ACCURACY MOVES<) <-  I wrote this title after Flower Trick was introduced in this video  Wait, how Silk Trap's accuracy is 101%?- (Actually, that's a signature move; past me)  (Edited) NOW SPICY EXTRACT HAS  THE 101% ACCURACY TOO???? HOW??! (Actually, that's also a signature (exclusive) move.)  (Edited #2) Third time with 101% accuracy, its REVIVAL BLESSING! Well, maybe it has an only PP  and it is an incredible move that's why they decided to give it 101% accuracy (It is also learned by only two Pokemon)  (Edited #3) 101% Accuracy Move #4 - Fillet Away (I was editing my comment as I watch this video, sorry guys :>) Alright, maybe its better than Belly Drum; I don't know  (Edited #4) Kowtow Cleave with ANOTHER 101% accuracy. I'm not mad, just shocked. Maybe it's a signature move of a Pokemon that's why it got that accuracy. And IT DOESN'T MISS. Why would they put an accuracy greater than 100% accuracy when IT DOESN'T MISS? Like, Aerial Ace doesn't have accuracy when it doesn't miss  (Edited #5) Well, Flower Trick is also a signature move; but from a starter. Again, IT DOESN'T MISS. And it's the same situation as Kowtow Cleave that the move doesn't miss.  (Edited #6) How many moves are they now that have this accuracy? Anyways, Shed Tail is a great move as what Wolfey said. Maybe they want to make it even greater than what people see and thought before the game released.  (Edited #7) Just after Shed Tail, there's Chilly Reception. Slowking can only learn it and its his only exclusive move.  My opinion about the 101% accuracy: Maybe that number of accuracy is been established because of the accuracy lowering moves in mainline series of Pokemon (currently there's 12 i think)  ANDDD, THATS ALL! If you get to the end of this comment with reading this whole, congrats or sorry for wasting or taking your time :> This is just a long comment about the moves with the specific amount of accuracy I didn't thought it would be like that.
Correction: Tera Blast can still be used without terastalyzing, it still stays Normal though
It’s weird seeing the difference between vgc and singles. Like mortal spin and salt cure are insanely good in singles, but I suppose in vgc they would be very niche.
I HEAR THE STEEL CASTLE THEME FROM POKÉMON CONQUEST HOLY SHIT
DUUUUUDEEEE revival blessing is really annoying by the spam of pokemon that are able to use em
Rage fist does have a upper limut at 5 hits or 350 base power
I mean, I do agree that twin beam isn't TOO exciting, but it hits twice so it can ignore things like focus sash or sturdy which isn't worthless
Shadow tag a salt cure user... That seems op.
question, if you ran maushold with a loaded dice, would it work? considering it does boost the chances of multi-hit moves, but the move is different from multi-hit moves because of its 90% accuracy per hit unlike the regular 1-5 probability and not accuracy.
Why tf are you saying Glaive so weird?
If a Pawmot uses Double Shock while terastalized in Electric, does Pawmot retain its Electric typing still?
Are there actually moves with 101% accuracy?
Quick correction about Double Shock. You can use it while Terastalized, and it does not take away your Tera Type.  This means if you Terastalize your Pawmot, you will be able to repeatedly use your Tera-DoubleSTAB Double Shock repeatedly, with no downgrade, making it a Close Combat level move with no drawbacks.
22:54  When you teralize, you can actually spam the move, its not that great, but with revival blessing...yeah, its make a Strong Mon
Torch song
*Population bomb* “The first attack that can hit more than 5 times”  *Beat up crying in the corner*
Population Bomb then a copy cat could be interesting.
9:55 pp up
Volcarona and iron moth still have fiery dance though
imagine using doodle for changing the ability of your slaking  no idea of how effective it would be but it would be pretty funny
22:22 gay plant
Fun fact: scoville is a heat scale, the higher the scoville rating the hotter it is
Hey, Wolfey! Could you make a video with the best pokémon and their moveset for raids? I'm having a hard time with 6 and 7-star ones. I know my team is not the best for them but I don't know who to use in those raids. Thanks and love your videos ❤💜
Miraidon is disgusting with Electro Drift. You need to do the total damage calculations of it considering what Miraidon does: Hadron Engine.  Hadron Engine summons Electric Terrain and also boosts Miraidon's special attack stat by 33% as long as the terrain is activated.  Consider a pure Miraidon with no item and just Electro Drift with Hadron Engine. Electro Drift on its own is base 100 special power, It gets 30% STAB, 30% Terrain boost to Electric, Hadron Engine's 33% buff. It can be between 193 to 292 base power. Then consider the yet additional buff of 33% if it is super effective.  Miraidon itself has 100/85/100/135/115/135 base stats. Jesus Christ this lizard will decimate anything it sees not a Ground type. Now give it Life Orb or Specs. Give it Charge or Charge Beam or Calm Mind or Metal Sound. What is it? Can't see the chimera of disaster you made?   Miraidon has the power to nearly one hit a Multiscale Lugia. What has Game Freak made?
Wolfey, if you tera electric pawmot, it wont lose its electric type
Twin beam is not F tier kings rock 2 chances to flinch or 2 chances to crit either way u might try to argue c+ but not f tier
Torch song vs fiery dance both 80 base power both raise specail attack only difference is fiery dance raises specail attack 80% of the time instead of 100% and is more widley avalible
Rage fist plus population bomb
Oh also to add on to double shock, you can use it consecutively if you terastillize to electric type. It will not lose electric typing if you're tera electric
Something else about torch song is its also a sound based move, so pairing it with throat spray gives you +2 spatk turn 1 and it can go through substitute
Tera blast picks your stronger attack stat, that brings it up to at least a b
Perish song, destiny bond, revival blessing, protect how many Pokemon can learn a combo of those moves?
Doodle ahould be in S because you can steal opertunitist
The funny thing about Spin Out is that you can use Shift Gear to cancel out the downside, essentially giving you a 100 base power move with no drawbacks
I sware on my life I used metronome and rolled a move that swapped hazards between sides.  Like my enemy used stealth rocks. Mentronome rolled this move, and then rocks were on the enemy side.  But I can't remember the move name and I didn't clip it. And I can't find a single resource citing this attacks existence.
What dissapoints me about comeuppance is that it doesn't have negative priority like the other 2. So if you outspeed your opponent you just don't get a turn.  I though it would work like mirror move where if you go first it calculates based on the previous turn, but no, it just fails.
I love how Recarm is basically in this game
I CANT WITH WOLF ABOUT SPICY EXTRACT LMAO
Best New move is last respects
wadda bout shedninja against doodle
Torch song is broken if you use it with shadow ball  and your skeleridge has a quick claw. I beat the game with him without any change maybe also the good luck and frienship take some part but it is a nice move
Tera rock Annhilape paired with low attack maushold plus helping hand.
I think youre very wrong about salt cure. It basically either forces them switch out or take a bunch of damage. It destroys pelliper talonflame and volcarona. It destroys dondozo. It destroys palafin. Also if you set it up right by using iron defense you knock people into body press range.
beat up can hit more than 5 times too, if you have a full party thats alive and has no status conditions, it hits 6 times
So wait, is it signature abilities or signature attacks lol
What would doodle do against calyrex
Does Double Shock's grade go up because Tera Electric Pawmi can use it consecutively? I know it eats up you tera spot, but I feel like it would be good late game after dealing with ground types and the threat of it could alter team comps on seeing it.
Phantom Force is another move that ignore protect and detect
I’m fairly certain rate fist does have an upper limit   I believe it only stacks up to 6 times  Someone was experimenting with a moushold ring target stat to maximise damage and it was unable to one’s hit the opposing Pokémon so they tried lowering it ti 5/6 hits and that appeared ti be the maximum
Mortal Spin is like Toxic that also does damage and Rapid Spin in a single move. I feel like it’s better than a D.
I made the same mistake when I read the description of Spicy Extract. What a garbage move.
6:37 Beat Up?
18:16 101% accuracy lol
when rage fist +. last respects + population bomb + gigaton hammer
I bullied a story mode team by giving skelidirge a choice scarf
When all of the starters final evolutions all have signature moves you know they’re good.
Wait until assist revival blessing becomes a viable strat... Wait, it actually is, and it is fkng disgusting with liepard.
Wait does hyperdrill break protect or not? Your edit says it does but everywhere else says it doesnt
I agree a lot with all of this but scovilion ( i so butchered that name sorry) could hit a special attacker or a tanky pokemon with the spicy extract move in double battle as the other pokemon hits with a powerful move to get the knockout i feel like it should be in c and just maybe B because of how powerful it can be against certain pokemon
A lot of hot takes, ngl. But still an opinion at best
Glaive is pronounced glayv
you said reflect instead of counter
F
fillet away does 50% of ur health, not 25%
at the comeuppance section, you were saying reflect and mirror coat. I think you meant counter and mirror coat. Sorry to call that out but my adhd brain wouldn't let it go, haha
“Reflect and Mirror Coat” He said it like 4 times how did he not catch that lol (Counter & Mirror Coat was what he meant)
I'm surprised I didn't see a future Wolfey come and correct himself when he said that Population Bomb is the first ever attack to hit more than 5 times when Beat Up can hit 6 times if you have all 6 Pokemon
What about tidy up?
Double shock is actually really good if you decide to terastialize to electric and use it again. A 120 move power without reciol is nothing to sneeze at.
He forgot spirit break
Spicy extract + Big Pecks Bombirdier
Everyone gangsta until u home claws and then baton pass into a maushold with population bomb holding a kings rock.
Wolfi: "The only move that can hit more than five times" Beat Up: Am I a joke to you? Pretty much anyone: Yes Also can I borrow your time machine Wolfi from the future? I wanna stop Hitler...
I really hope you make it to 1 million soon :) been watching for forever, thank you for being so consistently you and putting out content always ❤️
Like no one noticed "SIGNATURE ABILITY" on literally every place of signature move
Most of these moves are busted op
"Please don't use [Revival Blessing], I don't want to play against it" _And then GameFreak banned the two Pokemon from any future games._ *I will never forget or forgive what you Jocks did to Smeargel.*
I despise the pronunciation of Glaive in this video.
Tera Blast is good for Raids, especially with Moves like Torch Song to boost until Terastilizing.
Came back to hear you say glee-ave rush lol
Salt cure would only be good if you have a Pokémon with the ability arena trap.
wolfey is unknowing of what reflect does
I love your content, but I can’t subscribe in good conscience until you stop hacking/genning/cloning in the game.
ok you're a clown .... almost all of the mvoes are badly rated , is this dude even into strategy ?  or does he just do double vgc wich has a different meta ?
If only they gave Maushold access to Hone Claws
Question Do you want a Kalos dlc in scarlet and violet
Ok I dont understand why you dont like 2 hit moves, they arent outstanding but they are a good way to get rid of substitutes and sashes. if you can put twin beam in the F tier, than spicy extract could definitely go there too because its objectively worse
You forgot wave crash though
Is kings rock in this game? Population bomb gives me dumb ideas
Why does everyone say "Dodonzo"
Tera blast is also based of highest attack stat!
note for double shock: secondary effect doesn’t exist if pawmot tera’s and has an electric tera type. basically at that point it’s broken, it’s stab 120 base move with 100% accuracy on something with 105 base speed and 115 base attack
I'm sorry but Mortal Spin is an A tier move.
does pp up work for revival blessing?
Something you didn't mention about tera blast is that when you are terastalized it can be either physical or special based on whichever attacking stat is higher for the pokemon using it. This was in the text on screen but you didn't talk about it at all in your analysis.
With how broken it is and with how useful its ability can be, I imagine using Doodle on Gholdengo is a pretty solid strategy. Gives that status move immunity to your team.
Population bomb plus flinch
So spicy extract works amazingly well with pokemon that use Foul Play on the same target. Scovillan and Murkrow are an amazing use of this strategy.
Holding a leppa berry do give you another revival blessing tho
Clear amulet spicy extract doubles. It's like a better version of persim berry swagger
I deleted Revival Blessing on my Pawmot because you can just use a Revive and have the same effevt. Why is it in S+ tier?
Mortal spin also removes entry hazards and can hit (and poison) both opponents in double battles. Oh yeah, and Glimmora can get Corrosive as a hidden ability, so poison types wouldn't even be safe from the poisoning. So I think it's a little better than you gave it credit for.
Rage fist caps at 6 hits even after a revival blesing but is still a OP move
Does the drop from Spicy Extract work on Clear Amulet?
Made a number of mistakes during your original recording.  Maybe review the moves before evaluating them.
I know it is hard to miss because they already got one but Maushold also got Tidy Up which imo is S tier if not S+
Beat up hits 6 times I'm sure
No Tidy Up?
22:53 correction: If Pawmot Teras to Electric type, it can use Double Shock consecutively without any drawback because it will never lose its Electric Typing.
I really like Tinkaton and Gigaton hammer.  Tink’s movepool has a lot of utility options and the hammer means you can’t just ignore them after screens or thunder wave or whatnot.
Small correction: one person did a bunch of testing and did find out that Rage Fist has an upper limit. It's insanely high, I think around 600 or 700?, but it does cap off.
I think people are sleeping on trailblaze. Sure, it's not a good move by itself... but it's on various pokemon that can't boost their speed any other way. And/or has massively high attack. Like Slaking........ yea... Slaking gets trailblaze......
Salt Cure is fucking awesome, I love my Garganacl so much
Man this guy didn't do any research before making this video. There's so many mistakes with mechanics it's like he just read the game's descriptions for moves and decided that's good enough. Critiquing some moves for being on bad pokemon and decreasing their grade for it, but ignoring synergy for others is bad form. This is one of the worst tier list videos I've ever seen, both in execution of the list itself and in the understanding of the topic.
At the end for comeuppance, you meant to say counter and mirror coat, not reflect lolz
Twin Beam is good to break Sturdy and Focus sash :3
Twin Beam breaks focus sash and sturdy, which is something psychic and psyshock don’t do. I think F tier is a little unfair.
Oh rage fist's boost does not go away upon swiching/fainting? WHAT!? I'm just thinking in some way to purposely use a multi-hit move on it that does minimal damage. Full five hit attack makes it a 300 power move.
You can increase last respects BP by having pokemon revived by revival blessing die again. The cap is 5050 BP, yes, 5050. But that only works with a very fragile set up to get that powerful. If you have a rabsca and a pawmot in a vgc game, holding leppa berries, using that move, you can have up to 7 deaths, or have 400 base power on last respects. 450 if you decide to use your extra pokemon to Fling a leppa berry onto one of your revival users. 500, if there isn't a repeat pokemon rule
I don't think he knows about Leppa Berry Pawmot 💀
Spicy Extract raises the targets attack stat unfortunately
Spicy Extract is actually super potent when used correctly.  Setting up for Foul Play one-shots by your partner, or using it on allies who can't have their defense lowered (Clear Body/Big Pecks) makes it a Swords Dance you can grant an ally.  It's also fine to use on enemies who don't run physical attacks at all, or on an allied glass cannon with Defiant (giving it +4 attack and -2 defense).
If they still exist, a PP restoring berry would hypothetically allow you to use Revival Blessing twice in a single match. I don't know how useful it is nor when that PP restoring berry actually triggers, just thought it's worth bringing up.
Mortal Spin removes entry hazards too so in essence, it's a Rapid Spin that poisons the enemy instead of raising your speed
It's likely already been mentioned/addressed, but Wolfey actually makes quite a few mistakes in this video. Some examples include: 1) Order Up does not require Tatsugiri to be used, it simply will not activate its secondary effect. 2) Last Respects is the Signature Move of the Greavard LINE, meaning Houndstone gets it too. 3) Both of Spicy Extract's effects are applied to the target. Neither of them are applied to Scovillain itself.
So a few notes for gigaton hammer, population bomb, last respects, and revival blessing. Gigaton can get support from protect obviously but also in doubles medicham has access to role swap this gen and the ability huge power.  Population bomb can always hit 10 if you have accuracy boost item but if you baton pass a hone claws then running kings rock for a 100% flinch is good.  Revival Blessing can be used with assist so prankster liepard can troll.  Last respects to my knowledge works on a counter similar to rage fist and if revival blessing is used it doesn't lower and if that pokemon dies it goes up again. However, there is an upper limit that I think is 6. Finally Basculegion will have access to the move when it's able to be transfered. I would recommend a look at all their moves from legends as well since they were all tweaked for S/V. Sneaseler might become a must for any mix team with goldengo a counter to it.
Population Bomb is too broken.
Perfect explanation as always!
If you terestalized annihilape into normal then hit it with population bomb until it died. Then use that Revival move how strong would ragefist be?   550 basepower maybe even more. This the the most broken move ever.
screw tinkaton
Lol hyper drill is not broken it's made to break protection key word hyper drill
You forgot tidy up
WOAH WOAH WOAH 7:16 THATS A SHINY SCREAM TAIL THAT FLASHES LIKE RIGHT BEHIND THE MAUSHOLD
Spicy extract you're teammate while you have eject button or pack or whatever, Scovalian leaves, teammate swords dances, boom +4 atk and you have someone else who can better support it with follow me, life dew, dual screens or smth
Wait... mortal spin also cleans the hazards from your own field! Basically an alternative rapid spin (that also poisons the tarjet in 1vs1 or both enemies in 2vs2).
Spicy extract paired with foul play can be interesting
Dude imagine using pin missile against your own Annihilape
I didn't know that Rage Fist's power didn't reset when switched out! Oh that's great, I love it even more.
Pretty sure Chansey can learn revival blessing
So could you use doodle to remove slow start from regigigas?
Imagine if Tinkerton has Huge Power 👀
Use Population Bomb on your own Annihilape and you will one hit basically every pokemon
but this ghost dog is banned, at least in singles I think
22:25 Gay Plant™
good thing u talked sht on tinkaton in the last minute of the video lmao I woulda stopped watching tinkaton is god
9:42 you could give the Pokémon a leppa berry…
Pawmots signature move should be called short circuit since its super strong but also removes it's electric type.
I bet that they'll just ban Revival Blessing in competitive pokemon.
Gigaton Hammer sounds like a Z-Move
Chilling Water is actually an exceptional utility move in Tera raid PvE, because in 6-star raids the boss will shield itself, making it immune to status moves. however moves with secondary effects will bypass shielding. Because chilling water has a 100% rate of lowering attack, a good supportive pokemon, such as vaporeon, can cripple a raid boss' damage output over a few turns, outright killing it's ability to hurt your teammates, and vaporeon being a solid special attacker, it does respectable chip damage alongside it's genuinely good utility. i have been running chilling water and mud slap(yes, really) on a support vaporeon to push status through shields to GREAT effect
Slight correction on Population Bomb: There was one other move before this that could hit more than five times. Beat Up can hit up to six times if you have a full party.
You can use revival blessing twice if you use a leppa berry, or three times if you also have the ability Regurgitation
5:00 You goofed on Spicy Extract. It DOESN'T raise the USER's attack stat, it affects the attack and defense stats of ONLY the TARGET. It would otherwise be a hyper-OP Swords Dance.
Fillet Away is a Half Hp spend. Does that drop it tier for you?
future wolf makes a lot of appearances here and it's great. I subbed for that
Tauros .... Ash has alot of them...
I run a bulky Annihilape purely because of Rage Fist (100% investment into Attack, 50% into HP, 25% into Def and Sp. Def each) along with Leftovers, Drain Punch, Protect, and Bulk Up  Getting someone who actually lets me get some bulk ups off while hitting me for weak damage can swing a game completely in my favor, to the point where even reflect and iron defense basically means nothing, and with Drain Punch on hand I’m basically hitting everything for at least neutral damage, while hitting anything that resists Rage Fist for super effective and self healing damage  It’s actually bonkers how strong it is, I managed to get max bulk ups off and 200 power on Rage Fist at the very start of a battle once and swept Koraidon, Miraidon, Iron Thorns, and the rest of the team with just Rage Fist (if I remember correctly my opponent got too caught up in setting down spikes and t spikes, then switched to Lokix for First Impression, and just stayed in trying to hit me with Throat Chop while I kept stacking Bulk Ups)  Annihilape is one of my new favorite Pokémon and I can see it being a core member on a lot of teams moving forward
Rage fist does have a limit and it’s 6
About revival blessing I'm wondering: If I run toxic orb/endure tatsugiri/dondozo to get the boost, then revival blessing tatsugiri and get double boost from commander.
Lumina Crash is S, but move in wrong Pokemon.  For Espathra Lumina Crash is not too good, because Espathra is oriented for hit kill moves, Stored Power works better.  Population Bomb with Wide Lens increases this accuracy for 99%, With King's Rock Any hit have Flinch Chance.   Revival Blessing is Very Powerful, but in certain Situations is move is a great Backfire. Faster Pokemons  easily can Copycat this move, like Meowscarada, Jolteon and others. If your foe have a buffed Pokemon in Arena like Dragonite, you lose 1 turn for revive, and this revived Pokemon easily die.   Doodle in double battles is A.  Twin Beam i Disagree for F, 40+40 is 80, is not bad at all.  Two weak attacks is not bad because prevent Focus Sash users.
Population bomb should also be S+ imo it's broken af. Use wide lens and the chance each hit misses is 1%. Essentially only a 10% chance to NOT hit all 10. Plus technician and each hit benefits off stab is insane.
1:03  finally a move with over 100% accuracy
Just wanted to say that Dual Shock CAN be used consecutively if you are Terastalized as an Electric type, and I assume Burn Up would be the same for Fire type.  It also does NOT remove your typing while Terastalaized, so you can't become typeless with it.  Not sure if you were aware of that.
At the end, you’re referring to Counter, not Reflect.
Skeledirge's hidden ability is Unaware. You can go split defenses and hp, be bulky as hell so it doesnt matter you go last, hold lefties, and stack sp atk with torch song. Its pretty decent  Edit: for Double Shock, its meant to be used with electric tera, since teratyping forces you to retain your teratype, so you can continually use it
Fillet Away takes 50%
Correction: Population isn't the first move to hit more than 5 times. That award I believe goes to Beat Up which attacks once for each alive pokemon in your party!
Doodle+slaking = profit
I'm so confused about the Last Respects analysis. You should've given instances why would you want to use Houndstone (correction on Greavard) other than being the last Pokemon. You'd be building a team with this in mind.
Espathra's and it's Lumine Crash are an absolute godsend for raids. Kinda sucks that the two most popular raiding pokemon are phsyical attackers but even if you're the only special attacker on your team those sp. def drops really add up.
Waiting for Dudunsparse to overtake the meta...
Last respects is so broken surprised you didn't cover it
Population Bomb seemed to me to be alright if it just selected a number-110 average BP, 90% accuracy, STAB without any major drawbacks is pretty damn strong even if it's not as consistent as you want.  But with the fact that you can just make it always a 200 BP STAB move is just ridiculous-even if it requires an item.
gay plant
personally i disagree with twin beam being F tier as it has 100 accuracy and the two hits add to a total power of 80, which is 120 with stab and 160 with terrastalization, not to mention the fact that it has 2 chances to crit as opposed to just one with something like psychic. I would argue this move is probably at least C tier with that, but im not sure how many people will even be using farigaraf so it still likely wont be seen much in battle
If you run the hoist dog move with the S+ move then it is even better than before
Salt Cure damage every turn is too massive
doodle might be a good attack if you pair it with a slaking
With Revival Blessing you can give your Pokemon a Leppa Berry to use it twice
Spicy Extract sounds like a nightmare for a confused opponent
Population bomb isn't the only move that can hit more than 5 times right? Doesn't Beat Up also hit more than 5 times?
With spicy extract, what if you used it in doubles and used spicy extract first then foul play?
Rage Fist will likely be completely broken in double battles. If Bulbapedia is correct, it is boosted by 50 for every strike of a multi strike attack. Pair it with a special attacker that isn't bug type, but can still learn Pin Missile (maybe Jolteon). Since Annihilape double resists bug, you can use Pin Missile to quickly boost its Rage Fist while taking minimal damage. It can be boosted up to 6 times, meaning you can potentially reach near max power after 1 Pin Missile, and guarantee it after 3 (probably overkill). As long as your Pin Missile user out speeds the Annihilape, you may be able to have a 300 power Rage Fist on the first turn (with luck).
Annihilape in Double battles tag with a pokemon that can learn Beat up.
Have slacking as ur partner, use doodle... stonks
Gigaton hammer and salt cure carried me through the game
You pronounce glaive rush wrong and your killing me! GL-AVE!
Spicy is still good against special attackers
i would like to add that at 13:55 if you use throat spray on your skeledirgle you get stage 2 special attack boost while doing damage so it is very strong, i swept most of the content in the game with this :)
Edit: you ppl suck that's a funny joke   Isn't it nice when The World Champ makes a surprise appearance in a WolfeyVGC video
That Scovillain move could be nice for a Defiant double battle
Does Cyclizars sub combo with Anilape's rage fist?
wolfe violet paradox form keeps appearing in the middle of the video
spicy extract makes foul play godly
what about op grave dog
I feel like aqua step wouldn’t be nearly as good if it weren’t on a moxie Pokémon. Boosting speed and attack could make Quaquaval super useful
Salt cure is awesome in some raids or against pokemon that out level you. Got me through many gym battles and titans on my second playthrough without any tanks traded over. Salt cure is beautiful.
Double Shock is really really good with tera electric actually. The Pokemon doesn't lose the electric typing and you get the STAB boost so you've got a base 240 move you can use 8 times with 0 drawbacks
Spicy Extract on your partner Pokemon could be alright, couldn't it?  You get to setup and attack with something in the same turn, which is pretty wild.  Scovillain isn't a great user of the move (I think something more durable, faster and/or with access to more support moves would be a lot better, even if you have to give up a lot of power to get that), but I think the move itself could have uses if it wasn't a signature move.
wait where's houndstone's move?
“My hair looks stupid”  Are you kidding me, Wolfey? You look handsome as hell.
Spicy extract cripples special attackers and helps break walls its not so bad I think
Gigantic hammer, just hyper train and give it a bunch of attack EVs, and you’re golden
What's nice about Torch song is that it triggers throat spray so you can get 2 spAtk boosts in one turn
Couldn't you use doodle to easily get rid of truant on slaking?
It would be cool if Jet Punch became non-signature in gen 10, and just becomes the water type version of fire punch/thunder punch/ice punch
Spicy Extract actually can be very useful if used against a special attacker that doesn't make use of its physical attack at all. Not to mention you could take advantage of a Foul Play strategy with it.  The point is it's not as useless as it's description would lead you to believe.
Imagine: Choice Band+STAB+Attack EV+Normal Gem Explosion. Revival Blessing. Repeat
Dunsparce: "*sniff* D-Daaad. The other pokemon keep making fun of meee." Dudunsparce: "Alright. Pass me my Hyper Drill."
Last Respects so powerful it singlehandedly got Houndstone banned. "B tier"
In regards to double shock if pawmot is terrestilized you can use the move consistently.. I’ve wiped entire teams with just that move alone
Annihilape sounds like it'd be good with some leftovers
Isnt Beat up a move that can hit 6 times when you said that Population bomb is the first to Hit over 5 times?
Y’all heard the Pokémon conquest music durring scorch song? Nice
Actually twin beam is better in alot of ways in example substitute and focus sash
The great ace attorney chronicles BGM running in the background. This man is a man of culture. <3
21:26  QUESTION With a ring target on annilape Does mouseholds multihit move count for each individual hit ....cause...if anilape has fling or switcheroo to get rid of ring target after receiving a full blast from mausehold and then if necessary getting revival blessed ...that's 50 time ten throw in a speed stat baton passer to switch into the revived annilape....fuck it's good
Revival blessing smeargle 😁
Order up works without having Tatsugiri, and is very good with tera dragon
Scovillian spicy extract is broken use it on clear body dragapult or a clear amulet pokemon or worse case worse set up tailwind use foul play into an opposing pokemon which scovillian used spicy extract on! Footootoo found this out.This move should be A tier.
21:00 thanks god whimsicott is not in the game, that ting with beat up could have been a huge problem
Terastaralize bombardier with rock type it becomes a 160 power move
"DiD yOu KnOw DoUbLe ShOcK"  I think we get it by now  Also I'm really looking forward to using Rage Fist and Annihilape in general
SALT CURE! YES!
I'm very excited to try regigigas + doodle. Its definitely not neutralizing gas, but it will do
Wait, so the hit mechanic of Population Bomb is not rng, but it will keep going as long as it hits? Yeah, with Wide Lens and Technician that'll be broken beyond repair.  The worst thing is, Maushold is pretty darn fast and they hit just as hard as... Tinkaton??
Mortal spin also gets rid of hazards on your side, I feel there's a lot of potential there.
Honestly I've been so pleasantly surprised by all the new mechabics in gen 9
5:47 I just thought of a FIRE STRAT. So hear me out... what if you got a scovillain and a Goldengo with good as gold and used Spicy Extract on it, sice it raises the attack of the target and lowers its defense, since Goldengo's defense cannot go down it just raises the attack
Fun fact, mortal spin gets rid of hazards
Mortal Spin also removes hazards. I've been using it to great effect in that way
One cool thing 'bout Double Shock is that, since your type can't be changed after Terastalising, a Tera-Electric Pawmot can use the move as if it had no secondary effect. Pro'ly not enough to get it into a higher tier, but still cool nonetheless.
Tera-Steel Annhialape with Wide Lens + Population Bomb + Friend Guard Maushold sounds fucking absurd.
Doodle can be used to combo with Slaking [or Regigigas if it gets released this Gen], which is certainly interesting.
Spicy extract is goated if you have a teammate with foul play
If you want to panic even more about Revival Blessing, it can be used twice every game with a Leppa Berry. It can also be used way more times if you're willing to sacrifice a couple o' move-slots, since the move can be used in combination with Rest Talk. The move may even be callable by Copycat, but I couldn't find any information to confirm or deny that.
11:43if you use it while having shedinja as a partner and you target a Pokémon that has sturdy you could get an andefeatable shedinja because ita as 1 hp
Gigaton hammer
Hyper drill = gurren lagann
"First move ever created that can hit more than 5 times" man just forgot that beat up exists despite it being huge in doubles
You can actually use dubble shock twice if you terastalize and on pawmot it's ether going to bring a pokemon into the red or just kill outright
Dunno if someone mentioned this but Mortal Spin actually poisons all opposing pokemon, meaning you can drop poison on both pokemon at once in doubles, as well as clear entry hazards which I think makes up for the low power when Glimmora gets venoshock as well
instead of using revival blessing cant you just use max revivie
Get him to 1 million subscribers before the end of the year!
Does salt cure work in raids though?
💀🤓
Jigaton jammer
Ahh yes, reflect and mirror coat.
6:34 "Beat Up" can hit 6 times so population bomb isn't the first move to hit more than 5 times
Dude, spicy extract is busted if your teammate has clear body. You get to swords dance FOR them with no downside. Also mortal spin is literally poison type rapid spin.
Doodle is going to be a staple B-A tier if they add Regigigas
If you could get sniper on the grass starter through some shenanigans, you could just choice scarf sweep..
Watch's Foofootoo's video on Spicy extract and see why is does not suck. Poor imagination, Wolfe
Copy’s sturdy onto shedinja
This time you got me with subscribing, my inner me mouthed a lot:)
So, can Grafaiai just get rid of Truant at the start of a match??
The spice does that effect only to the target
Double Shock is actually pretty good if you Elec-Terastalize. You can use it with no type loss. Plus, the tera power gives you an extra boost. Could be amazing with the right set up.
9:58 what about pp ups also focus sashed shedinja is broken
Shout out to the Pokémon Conquest music you’re playing in the background. That game is a gem
Yo but Who the hell Is gay plant? 22:23
this man looks like he has a cool garage
Population bomb is a bit weird because even with perfect accuracy it will sometimes only hit twice, at least on Pokemon Showdown.
3:04 you do know Houndstone was IMMEDIATELY banned because of the move, right?
Tera Steel Annihilape + Mausholde Population Bomb  Might be a little broken
There's a lot of signature moves in this generation
Tera blast would be better if it always matched the tera type whether you activate your tera or not.
Doodle is ??? But Potential is endless. The face a friend of me made when I copied his azumarills huge Power to my Letarking was priceless
"Population Bomb is the first attack ever created that can hit more than five times" Weavile wants a word with you...
If you use white herb or clear amulet Pokémon the. Have them use spicy on your ally that could be good
Annihilape + Maushold is gonna be stupid broken. Just think on that real quick.
Also note, Chilling Water is litterally just Scald, but they removed Scald from like 99% Of pokemon. Its now a signiture of Volcanion IIRC?
6:58 imange don,t know this move broken 🤡🐷
William (I fogor salt mans name) is REALLY good from what I have seen on showdown
Is Terra Bast effected by Pixilate and change it to a fairy move? Seems like it might be useful that way.
Salt Cure is A if not a S rank Move.  If done right can be very OP.  Infact there are ways to defeat titans that are 20 or 30 levels higher with using just Salt Cure.  I am wondering if you have worked with any of these moves or just rating them based on stats alone.
The way Slowking used Chilly Reception and the Varoom immediately ran away 😆
Gigaton hammer and Glaive rush
I know I'm late, but I'd like to interject that Revival Blessing can actually be used *twice* if the pokemon with it is holding a leppa berry.
Meowscarada having a garuntee crit and crits being buffed to bypass stat changes sounds amazing. Definitely my kitty girl starter. (Just have to reset repeatedly or trade till I get a female! God damn it just let me skip RNG!)
Maushold with wide lens is so terrifying
Rage fist is just really cool and really fuckin strong so I like it
Rage fist maxes out at 300 base power
Wolfey, doodle is good you can run it with slaking!!
"This is GLIAVE RUSH," boy wtf you made me stop doing the dishes and rewind the video. Love u wolfey
6:36 no it is not beat up can hit up to 6 times if you have a full Team of six but i get why you said that cause the current format doesn't allow that to happen
15:35 if I'm not mistaken Psychic Fangs has 85 bp so I raise an eyebrow at calling it "much weaker" than a 90bp move lol 🤨
Mousehold + Wide Lens for the win lol
lol I love the sonic stamps
I just had an idea out of nowhere. What if Scovillain was to use spicy extract on a teammate with defiant? Like what if you used kingambit and scovillain and hit kingambit with spicy extract? That's x4 attack instantly. Just a thought.
Salt Cure gang rise up
Revival blessing would have been more fair if it sacrificed all of the user pokemon hp and give a specific amount of HP back depending on how many % the user pokemon had left.   In short basically sacrifice one pokemon for another. Also if they made it like this they wouldnt have needed to lock it behind 2 pokemons either.
I fucking hate Population Bomb. Maushold with Technician is the bane of my existance.
23:33 you mean Counter, not Reflect
Revival Blessing has 1pp but you can run a berry that restore your pp so you can use it 2 times per battle. Good video.
How, HOW is last respects not S+ tier
Here’s hoping that Cyclizar’s Showdown April Fools model is Yoshi on a motorbike XD
I can't believe protect is a good move in competitive pokemon lol
Twin Beam hits through stuff like Sturdy, Sash, Multiscale, Subs etc. and gets buffed by Technician to 120/100 base power with no drawbacks. Doesnt that make it technically viable/a better option than Psychic in some situations?
could u use an x- accuracy for axe-kick?I haven’t played the game
Using doodle could potentially be really good if your partner is slaking, because then you would have legendary stats without the detriment of truant. I was trying to find a way to incorporate changing slaking's ability into my competitive team and originally thought of Cofagrigus with Mummy... before realizing Cofagrigus isn't even in Scarlet and Violet. I'm glad there's an alternative!
Double shock can be used consecutively if its tera'd as elec. Not sure if that makes it much better but just a fun fact.
the salt move could be in a or b because if you use it when you are not sure in they will swap out or not
How does rage fist interact with multihit attacks?
What's a 1/ quarter?
Wait... Did you talk about Flip Turn? I remember Jet Punch, but I can't seem to find Flip Turn.
Gigaton Hammer won me the AI Sada battle.
If you use Double Shock after Terastilizing to Electric type, does that take away the electric type?
Whoa wolf was that some Valora defense/attack music I hear. Me likey
Imagine rage fist + population bomb
Aye who is this guy? He's kinda cool though
Spicy Extract is sweet for doubles. Foo recently did a video with foul play type attacks, plus a teammate that has an ability to not have it's stats lowered will love the attack boost.
mortal spin actually also removes hazards, not just wrap and leech seed. so instead of ghosts being the spin blocker it's steel  types.
Mortal spin is good in singles where hazards are more used
What was that music during the subscribe ad? Where is it from? Sounds like marvel v capcom, or The Legend of Heroes VI.
Volc does have fiery dance which is the same base power as torch song but only has a 50% chance of raising spatk. Still really good though but obviously not nearly as consistent as torch song
As for the Torques…Those are boss-only moves for the Starmobiles, which is aggravating when you realize that Revaroom getting them would make it fairly versatile.
Spicy Extract is better in Doubles formats, partner it with a Foul Play user
You actually can use double shock consecutively. If you terastalize to electric.
I really appreciate the use of Pokémon Conquest music in this video
while I agree is not the easiest move to slap on a team, I feel you are underestimating what spicy extract can do. if used on a pokemon with clear body or one holding a clear amulet, they will only get the attack buff without getting the debuff. the ability to give something like dragapult a sword dance boost should not be underestimated. on top of that, this move has really good sinergy with foul play, as both increasing your oponent's attack and decreasing their defense makes foul play hit incredibly hard  yeah, is on the gimmicky side, but it's a fairly strong gimmick
Did he talk about Tidy Up?
I think spicy extract could be beneficial in the case of using it in 2v2 matches. You can use it on your partner pokemon and still attack in the same turn. It's works as a good almost instant set up
Salt cure is good on titans and can be used with toxic
Glowup of the year is Primeape going from NU at best to the godlike Annihilape with a move that's like Bide if it never stopped charging and you can fire it when you want.
Did.....did he say "gleeave rush" and not glaive rush? Wtf
salt cure shadow tag probably op
You missed Tidy Up another signature move for Maushold it makes it an incredible anti-lead pokemon as it's a dragon dance combined with rapid spin
trick room+spin out would be broken
revivial blessing is S+??? wtf???
Dude, pokemon has been dead since black and white
The move I'm most scared of is, without question, Revival Blessing. I don't play competitive but I do watch it sometimes and it can get close. Revival Blessing could change things a lot.
Can you please pronounce glaive right, I love your videos but you're driving me crazy
Glee aev rush lol
Revival blessing can be used 2 times if you give the pokemon a leppa berry
Glaive Rush.... Glay-ve
Wolfey gives Order Up a B, after achieving rank 1 using it. Wolfey uses B moves.
AYEEEE HUGE POWER SLAKING IS NOW A THING, thanks grafaiai
'the first move to hit more than 5 times' beat up:
Dude, A Sturdy Aggron with the move Metal Burst is a lifesaver
does mortal spin work on rocks?
Rage fist is how my entire team got wiped
copying wonder guard gonna be op
23:40 do you mean "counter" and mirror coat?
23:33 Reflect or Mirror coat? ^^ i think you mixed counter with reflect
I think Spicy Extract has some niche uses. It can be good against bulky/physical defensive pokemon like Amoongus, Volcarona, etc and also have synergy with foul play.
You said Population Bomb is the first multi hit move to hit more than 5 times, but actually that's Beat Up which could hit 6 times
Spicy extract is amazing for: Breaking special attackers down  Destroying walls especially special walls But more important for you… BOOST YOUR TEAMMATE WITH CLEAR BODY (like dragapult) to incredible attack levels and avoid the downside or use white herb to negate defence drop or on Pokémon who has sturdy or focus sash to make a powerful sweep
Wolfey, you should take a closer look at spicy extract and it's synergy with foul play. If in doubles you have tailwind setup you can basically use spicy extract as a 4x helping hand for a foul play in doubles.
Out of the 3 starter signature moves I feel like Flower Trick is the best.
i now know why innialape is ghost type, so mousehold won't make it broken
Dondozo is S tier, and order up is SS tier. Dondozo isn't dragon type, so it gets super effective against something that can only hit it for 1X damage. And if Dondozo WAS dragon-water then you all would get angry at gamefreak for "ruining a goos pokemon" because now you get STAB at thw cost of a major weakness that's on almost EVERY COMPETITIVE TEAM.
make it rain's only downside is negated by the fact that it learns Nasty Plot as well
All the corrections I could find compiled for your reading pleasure:  - Axe Kick does 1/2 your health crash damage, the same as High Jump Kick. - Order Up CAN be used without Tatsugiri, however it will not increase any stats. - Glaive is pronounced "GLAY-V", not "Glee-ay-v". - (Not a correction, more of an addition) Mortal Spin also clears entry hazards from the user's side of the field, hits all opponents, and poisons them if they can be poisoned. - Fillet Away requires 1/2 of your maximum HP, the same as Belly Drum. - (Another addition rather than correction) Raging Bull removes Light Screen/Reflect BEFORE inflicting its damage, unlike other moves like Brick Break that do it afterwards. - Both Collision Course and Electro Drift have their power increased by 33% if they are supereffective, not 50%, giving you a 133 power move (doubled to 266 obviously due to being on supereffective) - Rage Fist DOES have an upper limit. 350 is its max (6 hits). Also, multistrike attacks do count for each hit.  And finally, - The physical retaliation move is called Counter, not Reflect.  Have a good day.
I have constant nightmares about population bomb
spicy extract can set up partner's foul play do 4x the damage or to buff ally (possible clear amulet)
8:56 it's pronounced glayv
Mortal spin D?D????YOUR GONNA TELL MY YOU GUCE D TO A FUCKING TOXIC WITH 100% ACCURACY AND ACTUAL DAMAGE!?!?!?dude did you have a brain fart?
Doesn't kowtow Cleave get 50% stronger with sharpness?
Spicy extract on a clear body ally or one holding the clear amulet is really good.
I love you, but do a little more research. So many mistakes in this one.
Spicy extract is could by great agains a difensive pokemon,like a pranks pokemon in doubles or a chansy in singles....dont sleep on it
Couple of ideas off rip 1. Population bomb onto rage fist whilst holdinh the ring hold item (whatever removes your immunities) 2. Glaive rush onto comeuppance + focus sash for huge damage
i hope everyone agrees that Annihilape should not be restricted to Paldea and that it should just be a normal evolution just like Honchcrow was just an evolution that was added later
Last respects with really high ceiling is just stupid in 6v6. This is how you know Wolfey never even touched singles
Very Minor Correction: Population Bomb is not the only move to hit over 5 times, the move Beat Up can hit up to 6 times
22:25 wait…   GAY PLANT?!?
This guy's grading is terrible, however it's cool to see a list of brand new moves explained
101%?
5:54 i actually see some gimmick potential with Spice extract, both as a free support swords dance on a partner with clear body/white herb/clear amulet Or a simple 100% accuracy defense drop to use on special attackers
As soon as I saw Maushold... I was like, yup, that thing is gonna be ridiculous somehow. 😂
doodle+Slaking
twin beam sounds like something that was meant for sweeping psychic type pokemon to bypass sturdy
Torch Song can also be paired with Throat Spray.
He rated Last Respects a B even thought it is one of the reasons Houdnstone got quick banned by Smogon xD
I was just playing the Ace Attorney series and legit thought I'd left the game on when this music started playing. Nice choice!
Did you not notice Spicy extract doesn't raise the users attack, but the opponents attack? It shows it in the background clip against the Chansey you're talking over... lol
Spicy Extract is a worse version of Screech, EXCEPT it can be very good if used against a special attacker.
5:50 You should have edited out your wrong explanation but is there not a use for this for boosting your sweeper? giving them sd
population bomb hits 1-10 times??? I thought it hit 8-10 times because I haven't been hit by it less then 8 times
doodle in a double battle would work with slaking
Why is a smallant stream the background..?
Something interesting is that Mortal Spin hits both opponents, so it's really good for spreading passive damage
Well mortal spin has use, its a field clearing move that can be used on ghost types, still not gholdengo though, cause steel- ghost
Population bomb + rage fist 😈
Focus Sash comeuppance when?
Spicy extract boosts the opponent, not the user
You forgot one thing Wolfy Aqua Step is also a Dance Move, meaning it can also be copied by Dancer.
I guess you have to correct yourself one more time. Ragefist actually has a limit of +300 base power, so 350 in total... not that it matters lol
Wolf using that Pokémon Conquest OST for the background music. Well done, my man.
Wait, did I miss the move "Tidy up" that Maushold learns?? Or is that not yet available in the game
Correction: Fillet Away cuts your HP down to half instead of 3 quarters. So its probably not that good...
Double Shock is actually not bad when tera-electric as electric type seeing you cannot lose your tera type. I don't know how the STAB multiplier works though. It would be 2x on the first use (base electric + tera electric), but then does the base electric go away and it becomes a simple 1.5x?
Comeuppance sounds like metal burst, but dark rather than steel
I made the exact same mistake with spicy extract in my playthrough. I got super hyped about it, thinking it was going to make scovillain absolutely insane, and then I read it again and was deeply dissapointed.
So a couple of things you didn't mention about Terra Blast compared to Hidden Power:  Tera Blast can be Fairy-Type, Hidden Power Cannot.  Tera Blast uses the higher of the Atk or Sp.Atk stat (potentially changes category to physical) - hidden power is purely Special-based. Even if it doesn't change category, this is HUGE as it gives physical attackers a coverage move that previously only special attackers enjoyed.  Order up: it CAN still be used without a tatsugiri, it just lacks a secondary effect.
I'm pretty sure Double Shock still works when you terastilize into an electric type and use it over and over.
my new favourite move is the miraidon signature move, since it looks like thunder clap and flash from demon slayer. the scariest move gotta be rage fist that stuff can do sum nasty dmg.
Shoutout to Gay Plant™️
In defensw of spicy extract. Its a move that can be used to make a teammate a sweeper or make an enemy die with low defense especially special attackers. I just wonder can defiant work if your teammate lowers your own stats Edit: tested on showdown does not proc allies defiant due to this id give it a C
Aint it DON-DOZO???
Rage fist caps at 350 I believe
23:32 Correction: its basically kind of like 'Counter' or mirror coat
I thought rage fist had a cap of 350
22:05 lmao Gay Plant
If revival blessing can be copycatted it'll b banned rly quick
Glee-ave rush
Or you be a smart wolf and delete every comment so people don't realize it happened like that 😂😂😂😂😂  and walk a bop great tusk into
Naw forreal if I'm correct pokemon fanbase owed me 50 likes
And remember I got to sit threw my no rank doubles moment where f that guy who did it to me off my knowledge the basically told to that by champion :( and watch it bop me
And do not protect that turn cause the devs made it not work on protect
I'm actually hella genius cause it packed clhloryhil
Really cause great tusk pact a bulk up with. 131 rv attack stat ugh that was randomly 0_0
So, guys, Revival Blessing clause in Nuzlockes? As long as you revive them the same combat they die in?
Dammit fuck you guys I'm a genius :( jk throw hope you have a safe night
Awe God my brain just read a great tusk on sunlight with plus 3 attack
Imma a be real with you wolf if scovillian targets your own pk with that move it made it so you 4 stacked on spawn 0_0
"Population bomb is the first move that can hit more than 5 times"  *Beat up entered the chat*  (Unless we're strictly talking about a competitive setting)
Tera Blast is the one move I hoped Pokemon would really lean into making OP.  Tera Blast would benefit greatly from a secondary effect based on the typing of the Tera's type. Burn, for instance, if you have fire. Maybe harshly lowering attack or causing flinch. There are as many status effects as there are types.  It's a move every Pokemon can use, and can only be practical during Terastalizing. Mainly Terastalize pivots would find it handy, but more Pokemon would become accessible candidates for Terastalizing. It would make the move and Terastalizing in general more interesting. Especially normal-type. Tera Blast is god awful as a normal-type move. Imagine the secondary effect of normal boost Tera Blast increases it's damage from 80 to 150 damage?
Correction: Double shock only removes electric type if you're not terrastilized so if you use it first turn then terrastilize in to electric type you gain the type back and there is no longer a drawback to the move its an s tier mover for sure
Correction, rage fist caps at 350 base power.  Also, it makes pin missile jolteon with loaded dice a pretty solid option in comp since it does like no damage to anihilape, but boosts the move to 250-350 base power 95% of the time.
Make it rain also has another secondary effect in play through, in that it gives you 5 x level pokedollars every time you use it, and twice that with the amulet coin.  This doesn’t work in comp or dens, but is a great way to make some extra cash in play through.
My question is how would salt cure work on Empoleon if it ever came to the game?  Would it take half its health every turn?
6:34 Beat Up can hit 6 times so its the 2nd move that can hit more than 5 times
Wolfey using conquest music in the video is absolutely based and champ pilled
Imagine Huge Power Garchomp with Steel Head swords dance and earthquake with doodle
Reflect and Mirror Coat? Do you not mean Counter...?
My Sharpness Gallade with Aqua Cutter, Leaf Blade, Psycho Cut, Night Slash, and a Scope Lens carried me. Even moreso once it hit high enough friendship to boost crit rate.
Twin beam is basically an 80 move that helps break subs. I would at least put that in C, especially with how strong Shed Tail is.
grafaiai with doodle combos really well with slaking
umm I think you meant Counter instead of Reflect when talking Comeuppance
Fillet away isn’t that good, I got stuck in a trainer battle ten levels higher than me and they only had a Veluza I managed to win with half of my team bc it used fillet away
Not sure if this has happened to anyone else, but my friend had a glitch happen in a Link Battle I had with him where he used Shed Tail and the pokemon that received the Substitute was still be able to be taken out like it wasn't in effect.   (Didn't even go away for the fainting animation, I used Boomburst with Toxicitry)
Give Maushold Hone Claws or Coil (idk if he/she learns it), and it always lands a 10 hit while on the field.
Fun fact: Population Bomb is classified as a cutting move. Why? No clue.
Beat up + Rage Fist anyone?
"Because it's just not a good attack" wow okay well now I understand 🤣
Is that... pokemon conquest music ?
mortal spin is really good in singles though
Population bomb isn't the first move that can hit 10 times, there's been beat up since gen 3. Although in doubles yeah that's not happening, just a technicality
23:40 someone's mixing up Reflect and Counter
Last respects carried me through the ice gym and Eri
I think you're underestimating Last Respects a bit. 300 BP is still a monstrously powerful thing to drop on something's head, even when predicted.
Silk Trap is NOT better than baneful bunker if you have merciless. I have cleared entire teams of legendaries in singles with this toxapex. My KING ❤ but yeah in any other case way better
What if you use a move and copy and it is reivivel blessing
Rage fist hit by 10x maushold attack. 550 power attack.
So many mistakes in this video
Spicy extract could be useful against a special attacker
I *think* I know the answer to this but if you give Moushold a Kings Rock, will each of the possible 10 hits from Pop Bomb have a chance to trigger the flinch?
But Twin Beam hits twice; negating Sturdy or Focus Sash!
2 pikemon =2pp for heling
I would love to see a 200base power move that only works if it hits two targets. So if your opponent protects with one Pokémon it doesn’t work.
If tera blast worked off of the tera type without needing to terastal it would be far better
Actually Mortal Spin is OP, it removes entry hazards as well. So an even better rapid spin
SALT CURE IS GOOD LET BE EXPLAIN  if you run a a hyper defensive garganacl. You can survive a wave crash from palafin. The salt cure can practically devastate the offending palafin
terra-electric pawmot can actually use double shock multiple times. idk if it’s intended or a bug but it doesn’t lose it’s typing
Splash
You could run salt cure with something like shadow tag or arena trap then sit there and watch the opposing pokemon wither away
You could run salt cure with something like shadow tag or arena trap then sit there and watch the opposing pokemon wither away
Flower Trick
Don-do-zo.   Man, if only people can read 🤣
Hey, fun fact, if you Electric Terastalize, you can spam Double Shock, no down side!
My mans favorite pokemon from this gen is the minecraft desert temple
If Collision Course is S, Electro Drift should be S- or A+ because Electric is only supereffective against Water & Flying, whereas Fighting is supereffective against Normal, Ice, Rock, Dark, & Steel.
You forgot the legend arceus moves that were added into sv
Double shock actually wont effect your typing if you terastalize electric. So a 120bp stab move that is now doubled in power and easily spammed. Pawmot might actually be a good offense threat
Tera blast on a normal type though
If you're plaving vgc, spicy extract is good on a pokemon with defiant, bc it will increase attack, and instead of lowering defense, itll raise attack again
I feel like spicy extract is good to use on enemy special attackers to set up for your physical attacker to one shot them
order up the same grade as last respects ? wat ?
Salt Cure is my fav atk. Nacil makes pokejerky of all my opponents.
He meant counter, not reflect. So many moves out there, easy to get them mixed up
Bruh you're giving out WAYYY too many S tiers This mf woulda given splash a C and drain punch an S
Rage Fist has an upper limit of 350
Reflect =/= Counter
correct me if I am wrong but items that increase PP still exist in this game right? So is revival Blessing really only going to have 1 use professionally? I do not know the rules and thought Pokemon could have PP increased before being in a match?
So there was a dark move in X&Y I believe that could hit 6 times... at least that was how I remember it. Teamwork? Forget its name... I think I had it on a Scrafy (dark fighter holds up its pants skin flap)
I am very angry with Mortal Spin not being Special and not inflict severe poison, despite being the signature of Glimmora and  the remove of Toxic MT
Grafaiai doodle on intimidate with a slacking as a partner will be interesting
23:07 buddy, using this move on a double battle and your other Pokémon has mimic, let’s just say that everyone is gone.
Sorry I just want to be sure (I don't play pokemon in a long time). 23:33 Reflect now retaliates like Comeuppance?  Or Wolfey was talking about Counter?
I too Wolfey used to call him dodonzo after i learnt its don dozo
Based off the response to the new Pokémon and new moves. It feels like Pokémon stopped caring about power creep and keeping competitive stable. The revival move is garbage in game. Like why waste a move slot when I can use a revive mid to late game or just run back to the Pokémon center. It feels like this move was specifically made for competitive and is absolutely broken in that context.   Thoughts?
Mortal spin also removes hazards on your side of the field , the only check to this move is a steel immunity although glimmora gets corrosion as an ability and can poison steels. A+ move
spicy extract could have potential. e.g against special atkers
triple dive is going to be a good move once more pokemon get it. 105BP that breaks subs and sashes
The Jet Punch is sort of just not hiding power creep... "here we did aqua jet but stronger"
a guaranteed x2 stat drop on an 80BP psychic move ...... now that is some power creep
I think Electro Drift should be rated a good deal higher than Collision Course since it gets further boosted by Miraidon's ability while Collision Course is not boosted by Koraidon's ability.
Pounce is really good on technician scizor
Pounce is really good on technician scizor
9:45 leppa berry says hello
Technician ab .
I don't think gigaton h ammer is S grade, more B IMO. Tinkaton att power is very low. Then you can't use it twice in a row.
Find some way for Maushold to hit Annihlape with Population Bomb 550 base power Ghost move go brrr
you will always get hit 10 times from population bomb, unless of course you are dead before it gets to 10.
11:11 I would Grade the move higher considering how i can also remove hazards such as stealth rock
4:01 the only thing I used order up is I want those nice sushi
Fun fact about double shock: no one reads the comments before posting about it
One correction: this is not the first move to be able to hit more than 5 times, because beat up was able to hit 6 times. So it is the first higher than 6 from beat up, but not the first higher than 5
5:05 in both the description AND the live example it says and shows that both effects are on the target, you dont set up at all.   This is just one of those swagger "hit yourself" type moves...  Edit: Future me responding to future wolf. Yeah...
Sorry, bicycle pokémon is a lot to me :X , to me, Pokémon Company is floping
23:30 Reflect or Mirror Coat ....  I would like to counter your statement with the fact that it can be good if used with Focus Sash
Your hair reminds me of torchic idky
Spicy Extract isn't so bad if you're going against a special attacker, no?
How low must your rating be to think Last Respects is anything besides S tier.
Moushold makes rock, fighting, and ghost types mandatory
You overlooked a couple key details on Mortal Spin. Hazard removal and guaranteed poison. It's basically a better version of Rapid Spin. Get rid of stealth rocks or spikes and poison your enemy at the same time, setting you up to deal massive damage with a Venoshock.
Not sure if this is correct (I checked the comments and couldn't find any other ones that did the math on it), but I did the calculations on the average damage of population bomb and got that it's expected to do ~117 damage on average, which would be wild if correct.
Feint isn't the only attack that bypassed protect before gen 9, there's shadow force, phantom force, hyperspace hole and hyperspace fury
Honestly I really like Terablast especially on a Normal type where it preforms double stab duty. The fact that it uses your higher attack stat is amazing plus it can give stab to mons without any moves of their Tera type. Icing is that it has unique animations for all 18 types. I'd give it A tier for sure.  Good job fixing yourself on Spicy Extract I was about to call you out on that :P  Agreed Mortal Spin is a bit of a letdown, it's even physical on a special attacker. Basically a weaker bp Rapid Spin that poisons instead of increasing speed. One thing to note is it hits both opposing in doubles which is potentially really solid if you need them to be poisoned hell you can even poison Steel and Poison types if you run Corrosion. I'd give it a C since it has use cases, but it would have been higher on a mon like Toxapex instead of the special atk powerhouse Glimmora.  12:36 That was half health my dude.  For Double Shock if you Terastalize you don't lose or regain your Electric typing allowing you to use it every turn.  You missed some moves: Maushold only, Tidy up: raises the user's Attack stat and Speed stat by one stage each. It also clears away substitutes, Spikes, Toxic Spikes, Stealth Rock, and Sticky Web on both the user's and target's side of the field. The user's stats will still be raised even if there are no traps or substitutes to remove. Snowscape: Replaced Hail and ups the defense of Ice types.
Glaive is pronounced Glayv by the way, it's ai not ia
Doodle in doubles with your Slaking partner? O.O
even casually tera blast has that issue. I wish it was 50 or 60 power but the type your tera type is, and it just becomes 80 after terastalizing
population bomb and rage fist when shange by tera type
Wait wouldn't the +2 atk and -2 def from spicy extract actually be really good in 2v2? As long as you gave your ally pokemon a white herb you could swords dance with them and then get another +2 from that move with no drawbacks at all
You forgot Tidy Up which uh its a lil busted idk why they gave maushold 2 signaturemoves that are so strong
damn population bomb is the first move to hit more than 5 times? i guess beat up just doesn't exist then
Everyone gangster til the beat up rage fist meta awakens
Wanted to mention that if you terastalize pawmot into an electric type double shock can be used constantly
Rage fist does have an upper limit. Population bomb which can hit ten times does not make this move do like 550 base power... It caps around 6 hits taken
I’m deeply disappointed that Spin Out wasn’t just Revavroom doing doughnuts around the opponent.
22:23 who is gay plant?
Kings rock with population bomb.
"Tera Blast is worse Hidden Power" Isn't it better to call it a worse Judgement?...
I like Flower Trick and am terrified of population bomb
Correction on Double Shock: If you terrestialize electric, you become typeless after using it and have no type weaknesses.
if you copy intimidate, nothing will happen
Chilling water seems good as an alternate version of scald that doesn't trigger the Guts ability.
Holy shit, I had NO IDEA about that Revival Blessing move, that's insane!
Population bomb with the loaded dice item. 👀 Or is it bugged to where focus lens would be better.
How can you not be scared of Hyper drill. I don't even play competitively and I am terrified of it.
Just FYI you and most everyone else probably already understood meant Counter not Reflect @ 23:31 regarding Comeuppance. Have to give it to this game for introducing some interesting new Pokemon and moves at least.
Annihilape Rage Fist + Beat up = Win?  Waitwaitwaitwait... how about a Ring Target on the Ape and a Tandemaus using Pop Bomb?
I need to test the reviving move with a leppa berry...
Yo wolfey you forgot phantom/shadow force when talking about moves that break protect
Did you mean counter and mirror coat
If you terastilize Pawmot into electric you can use Double Shock multiple times. The first time it will be 2x stab and the following will be 1.5x stab
Near the end of the video you were saying Reflect and Mirror Coat, instead of Counter and Mirror Coat.
Can you use leppa berries with Revival blessing? Or will it fail on the second use?
nice video
I think Salt Cure deserves an S because of it's an anti-wall move. Think of how many bulky water and steel types are around. Types that normally threaten Garganacl. If they switch in on a salt cure, they risk getting destroyed because they're already down 1/3rd of their health (I know it does 1/4th from the status effect but garganacl is a big boi and that hit would do a little chunk before the residual damage hits). It also kind of forces your opponent to double switch because if they're using a wall like Toxapex, they're not gonna want to take an extra hit on top of another 1/4 of their hp drained. It either forces a recovery game they can't win (they're forced to use recover and even then they'll be at 75% instead of 100) or they're smacked down. Granted pex would take that deal because of regenerator, but most steel walls are gonna be hurting badly. Especially since most don't have reliable recovery.
"glee-ayve rush"
Couple things, there does turn out to be an upper limit on rage fist, however… that limit is 350 bp after taking 6 hits, which basically OHKOs anything that isn’t immune anyway. Also I believe mortal spin has the rapid spin hazard removal effect which makes it much better, though mostly in singles.
ayo who is the editor that put in the great ace attorney music??? they deserve a raise
I’m kinda sad because I’m pretty sure revival blessing means no Smeargle this generation… They could just give it the dark void treatment though I guess, which they might need to do anyway. Or they could just be madlads and add Smeargle and Shedinja with no changes.
Rage Fist does have an upper limit, of 350 power after six hits, which still makes it the move with highest base power in the game, if you live long enough to set it up. Something else that you didn't mention about it, it counts each of the individual hits from multi-attacks like Fury Swipes, allowing you to theoretically get up to 5 boosts from 1 round, or fully boosted if you Population Bomb Annihilape for at least six hits. It also counts self-hits from confusion, letting confused Annihilape power up itself.
Luckily none of the pokemon that learn revival blessing also learn recycle or have the ability harvester. Cause pairing it with a leppa berry could get pretty annoying.
Salt Cure is one of my favourite new moves. It doesn't necessarily require a high attack stat since it does residual damage, plus does excessive residual damage to two types the Garganacl line are weak to. Can also cause swaps which is also really nice
Rating silk trap is funny because in a vacuum it’s the best move on this list, protect is the best move in VGC and this is better and potentially the best of the moves that are better. But outside of a vacuum every Pokémon gets protect and this offers a fairly marginal improvement compared to how good protect is already.
Double shock can be used consecutively if you terastalize it to electric type.
Aura sphere with lucario is OP
All I am gonna say Scizor now has a technician boosted bug type move now
Hyper Drill is not only DuDunsparce's signature attack. it's needed for Dunsparce to evolve. Same with Twin beam on Girafarig.
Doodle can get rid of slackings traunt
pairing population bomb with king's rock can be rather infuriating potentially
Wolfey you can use order up without tatsugiri, you just miss out on the stat boost. If you need dragon for coverage for whatever reason an 80 power dragon move is nothing to sneeze at.
1:30 Most pokemon in *doubles* want to run Protect. Most pokemon in singles don't. I think that's a big clarification to make here. It's still a great move, but important to note.  In fact, I feel like there should be some differing grades for singles vs doubles.
Playing on showdown, when pawnmot tera electric, it wouldn’t lose its typing from double shock, making it completely insane.
Greavards banned!!!!!
dirty strat me first reviving wish
Gigaton Hammer deserves to be an S Plus because it basically has no drawbacks you're probably just going to kill everything in one shot at the release of what I've seen cuz I have a thinkaton on my team and is and it's a menace it doesn't matter what it is it dies in just one hit so yeah good guitar and hammers should deserve like S Plus
Gay plant
SWITCHING OUT DOESN’T RESET THE POWER INCREASE OF RAGE FIST??? Has this been tested and confirmed?
can you give Revival Blessing PPup? anyone able to confirm yay or nay?
Think Garganacl deserves a spot. Stockpile/recover/salt cure/bodyoress. With Tera Ghost
It's Counter, not Reflect
somebody was watching Ninjago when making ice spinner
Make it Rain is way too powerful, how the heck
6:33 Beat Up...
Talking about population bomb and not mentioning the kings rock potential
Does anyone know if the multi hit attacks like bullet seed effect the hit counter for rage fist?
I guess the order up rank did not age well😆
Technically Beat Up can hit more than 5 times, very VERY niche and not applicable in VGC format, as it'd never hit 6
14:25 personally i dont know about how good it is in competitive but silk scarf torch song skeledirge absolutely carried my nuzlocke lmao
Isn't there a berry that can restore pp of one move? that's right REVIVAL BLESSING
Glee-Ave? Double Battle Spicy Extract combos. Spicy Extract + White Herb Spicy Extract + Clear Amulet Spicy Extract + Clear Body Spicy Extract + White Smoke Spicy Extract + Full Metal Body
Gigaton hammer
Mortal spin is better than rapid spin.. how is it bad??
Swagger and spicy extract is the ultimate glass Cannon, confusion luck
Beat up can hit 6 times, Stop getting excited and making mistakes 😒
Was not expecting SV's most terrifying opponents to be a pile of mice and a french fry man
Wolfey, you forgot about some moves, like Tidy Up and Headlong Rush Tidy Up is like Defog + Dragon Dance in 1 Attack and Headlong Rush is like Close Combat but as a Ground Attack
Hi from Sweden! Statistics on population bomb!  I ran a quick simulation study (montecarlo) on the power of population bomb since I was also interested in it.  The expected value over many trials, I ran 100000, converges towards 5.84-5.88 (95%CI) average hits per usage, which in power terms means 116.73 - 117.66.  However, the store does not end there, due to the the move works the distribution is actually skewed towards 10 hits, I'll link some proportions i think are interesting to know below.  chance of getting 10 hits ~ 35% (equivalent to 200 base power) chance of getting 7 or more hits ~ 48% (equivalent to 140+ base power) chance of getting 5 or more hits ~ 59% (equivalent to 100+ base power)  The pokemon who knows this move (Maushold) gets Technician and STAB. Which would change the power calculations to about 263 on average, with a 35% chance for 450 power and half the time the power would hit at least with  315 power.   Potential for a sweeper? Now, I am not at all a pokemon master, I haven't played since Emerald, thus I won't be able to answer this one myself. Maushold gets 111 speed which I don't know if is enough, this attack will also go off the pretty low 75 attack stat and be normal (never supereffective). It is probably walled by rock, steel, and ghost switches due to its predictability as a one-trick pony. But who knows, maybe other setups (for Maushold) will appear that provides a spot for the mice.
If you Teralize with pawmot you can use his signature move always and it's pretty broken, but then again you have to give up teralise and i don't think is worth it
Reflect and mirror coat? He means counter and mirror coat.
Quick note rage fist only maxes out to 6 times aka 350 base power it will not go up to 1050 base power with population bomb it will still be locked on the 350 base power There are ways to use revival blessing and to counter that strategy  1 To counter that strategy you need hazards such as toxic spikes spikes stealth rock paired with goldengo good as gold ability they have no chance of defoging the hazards and just whirlwind or roar them out every turn with a prankster pokemon 2 About using the revival blessing strategy you need a pokemon that can use revival blessing and a pokemon with prankster and assist and make sure to do this so that only revival blessing can be used and you can just use revival blessing forever as long as the counter strategy from above comes in play
All people discussing new moves. Also I: "Gay plant joined at 22:23"
with torch song i destroyed most of the gym leader and of the league
Wolfey: This is the first attack ever created that can hit more than five times Beat up: Am I a joke to you?
I mean, even without Hyper Drill, I can see Dudunsparce being used, specially in Trick Room teams, for one specific reason: Serene Grace Rock Slide. Truly a fucking Parafliching nightmare to deal with.
There is one use I can see for Spicy Extract, which is a Defiant mon: with one move, you drop their defenses by -2 but increase the attack by +4. And while Scovillain isnt the best, it does get two awsome abilities in chrolophyl (and fire stab to differentiate itself) and Moody.
Bro, Fire Paldean Tauros is basically better arcanine: will-o-wisp, intimidate and can break screens. it´s a pretty good mon.
Order up can be used without tatsugiri btw I used it in my play through not the strongest thing but it’s coverage it otherwise wouldn’t have
2:32 Houndstone learns it, not Greavard. Plus White-Striped Basculin can have it as an egg move.
Revival Blessing could become very potent. It may only have 1PP; but its PP can be renewed by a held Leppa Berry. More terrifyingly; the move can be called with Sleep Talk to get around the 1PP limit of the move. Rabsca and Pawmot aren't the greatest stat-wise, so it's likely going to have very low usage.  Additional downed Pokémon from Revival Blessing also count towards Greavard's Last Respects beyond 200BP and Kingambit's Supreme Overlord ability by going over more than 3 fainted Pokémon in VGC.  I do not feel the move will become a meta pick, but it will have a very unique placement depending on what people decide to do with the move.
I got swept by a guy with a Hidden Ability Quaquaval. Aqua Step + Moxie is a scary combo. Its like hitting D Dance everyturn but also doing damage
Something I think people forget about pounce is that scizor gets it. It becomes a LOT better when it's a STAB and Technician booster move
Fun fact if you tera type into electric,  you can't lose your typing an can use double shock repeatedly
I think last respects should receive at least A if not S tier, because it got that doggo banned from the OU
Give Maushold Wide lens. Each hit will have a 99% chance of hitting. The move will have a 90% chance to have 200 bp. Not including technician + stab. That’ll push it to 450 bp. Adding normal Tera, that’s 600 bp. This Pokémon is going to go bonkers.
Wait, how the heck is Revival Blessing not a fairy type move? Especially with that description?
Can you use Doodle to get rid of Truant?
you can use doodle to get a cubchoo with cud chew. S-tier
Tera Blast is too good if you realize it and very broken. Essentially it will always be the element you tera into and always cater to your stats if you chose sp atk or atk. It also does better on tera shields. This ends up being more vital then you want it to be for raiding. Should be in there on raids. Also you should note to seperate grade from competetive and raids now. Raid stats and moves will have different effect then competetive. Competetive may rely on speed where as raids don't and some healing as example may work on raids but not in competetive. HP stat becomes vital in raids where speed becomes relevant in competetive. Things like helping hand are powerful in raids but not so much in competetive often. In terms tera should be used for sure for raids when it happens with 5 and 6 star star so rely on it.   Also to note that element no longer really extremely matters but movesets and tera. Also tera is the way to play properly in raids so tera and move sets become your full reliance. So no you don't look at a pokemon's initial element it is but it's movesets attacks and if it's stats are sp atk or atk.  Also Blessing Revival isn't that good. Useless in raids and has to be on useless pokemon for competetive. A;sp why'd ypu use protect at all. You do nothing while protected given very little use of the move,
Grow up stop playing video games made for preteens.
.Reflect….. did you mean counter.
Spicy extract boost opponents attack by two
About Last Respects  Apparently the power increase increases every faint. There is no limit. Every. Faint. So let's say two of your pokemon have revival blessing. You've now got equal power 5 pokemon fainting.  And in game since you have items it's even stronger.  So you can just put out a full team of super weak mons, a tank, and houndstone. Faint everyone up to the tank, revive as many as possible, let the tank die, go into a cycle of faint, revive, faint, revive, and it's capped at 5050 damage. For reference explosion can only do 250.  Unless I am entirely misinformed and that's possible, then Last Respects is THE strongest move.
Losing my mind at that pronunciation of Glaive lmaoooo
Wont Doodle actually be really strong if your pair it up with a Slaking? The truant less  Slaking is always like a dream come true
Wolfey, in 6v6 singles, population bomb + tidy up is disgustingly broken combination, unless you've got a ghost type/priority/bulky mon you'll probably auto-lose the game.
Could spicy extract be good to set up your other Pokémon that is holding a clear amulet? Would be good for them to either attack and get +2 or maybe boost its speed and then be fully set up the turn after
For some reason when I first saw salt cure I immediately thought of your channel 😂
I wish salt cure was higher base power (like 60)  and was super effective against water and steel too
*Says fillet away takes 25%* *shows clip of it taking 50%*
If I'm not wrong Rage Fist was proven to have a max base power of 350 (after 6 hits), which is always amazing but it's not infinite bp. Saw this on YouTube but I don't remember whose video was it...
goin crazy with the vids 🔥🔥🔥
21:20 there is a limit. It’s like 300/350. It can’t go any higher than that.
Have Maushold hold a Ring Target, hit Anniahlape with Population Bomb, if it hits all 10, 550 Base Power attack.
23:30 - Calling Counter "Reflect" 3 times in a row.  WORLD CHAMP DIFFERENCE
You find out Dunsparse gets an evolution 😁. Then you see it 😟. Then it's Signature move is awesome 😁. My emotions are all over the place.
what is the hoenn ost remix called near the end
Glaive rush can miss but the next attack of the opponent won't miss
Salt cure is really good in singles. The chip is so high that you’re practically forced to switch out and if you try to defog on it with Corviknight you lose a solid chunk of health. It’s a wall like toxapex but it actually does something rather than sit there.
Can anyone help me get into the discord? I’ve tried every way I know.
Salt cure shadow tag. Gothetelle is in the game, after all.
Revival blessing. I used like 3 pp ups on it lol
Grevard Last Respects would make good chemistry with memento.
8:56 The way he pronounced "glaive" kills me xD
10:09 Your favorite pokemon is salt cure?
Doodle with slaking
MOST FAVOURITE: FLOWER TRICK.. MOST WEARY OF: AQUA STEP..
ngl kinda shocked at how low mortal spin was rated.. it’s a rapid spin w a new effect and can hit common spin blockers aka ghost types! although the cinnamon stick kinda takes over huh
People still calling them Dodonzo whe the actual name is Dondozo
Note on Double Shock: it has no drawback if it's terastallized as Electric. So it can be used consecutively and gets the tera boost and same type tera boost. It's ridiculous
Fun thing about jet punch and rage fist. Both moves got their native pokemons banned. This generations been proven how much of a wild card the new additions can be.
Every time I watch a form of review I have to remind myself "He plays VGC, not singles... He'll never know how truly annoying salt cure is."
I saw chilling water as a consolation prize for losing scald :')
aqua step is absolutely broken for one very simple reason: the mon it comes on has a little hidden ability called moxie. this is the same idea that made moxie gyarados with max airstream so stupid in swsh is it would keep increasing its speed and with every kill that speed increase did it got even stronger allowing it to run away with games.
You promised "in one week" a video about the best tera type for every pokémon, where is it? 😒
So I don't know how doubles works, but if you can baton pass hone claws to maushold and give it king's rock... Population bomb has an approximately 2/3 flinch chance. It would have been so busted in singles if baton pass wasn't banned lol
One thing about spicy extract: you combine it with an ally pokemon who has clear amulet or clear body(pult), you swords dance them and they can still attack. E. G. Scarf scovillain and amulet lando t. Lando terastilizes to rock, scovillain goes first and boosts it, then lando rock slides. If you don't run scarf scovillain has extra utility in rage powder and helping hand.
Ok, so correct me but revival blessing is a one pp move meant to revive one Pokémon, so add the leppa berry?
Oh God, I was thinking about doing competitive for this gen but uhhhh nope 😂
Why is Spicy Extract 101%? I'm not a competitive player so maybe it means something in the community, but wouldn't that just mean it passes accuracy checks and not be given a percentage?
wolfey putting revival blessing in s+ instead of ag
Overall I would say the ratings are good! I do disagree with Mortal Spin in terms of singes because it's so good for hazards, in doubles it's pretty bad though. Spicy Extract I'll have to disagree for doubles viability though. I've just tested this, but Spicy extract works with Clear amulet or Clear body in the sense that you can boost your ally's attack by two stages without getting the lowering of defense due to how the ability/item interacts with stat drops. Clear amulet is usable on any mon, slap it on Scovillain's partner with spicy extract on the Scovillain and you have yourself a more offensive version of coaching. Plus with the effect of the amulet, moves like charm or abilities like intimidate don't affect you either. It does require an item slot, but IMO it's worth for a free swords dance boost every turn. Also, it can work as a 100% accurate screech for special mons or if you know you're gonna outspeed with a physical threat. I could see it being used in combination with a pokemon like Baxcalibur, because you'd have Fire STAB as well as having a way to activate thermal exchange in case you get taunted or tormented, Spicy Extract to boost Baxcalibur up while it's holding the Clear Amulet, and Baxcalibur couldn't get burned, the one way to lower it's attack with the Clear Amulet equipped. I'd give it C at least for it's utility in this regard. Mostly because the pokemon itself is not amazing outside of moody shenanigans. But if anything would give Scovillain a niche in doubles, Spicy Extract would. Also I'm sure this has been mentioned but Double shock does not get rid of electric typing while terastylized into an electric type. The way I was horrified when I ran into this pokemon on ladder and saw it do this after I thought I was like good and didn't need to worry about electric type STAB anymore.
Rage Fist Annihilape is impossible to beat in tera raids...
Aegislash should definitely get sharpness imo
Reflect or Mirror Coat... it hurt me deeply every consecutive time he said that. It hurt me worse that he didn't future edit it... Counter @wolfeyvgc ... it's counter...
Mortal spin removes hazards too so it's much better than you think at least in singles
Revival Blessing should never be allowed in any competitive Pokémon format (except Anything Goes), Smogon or VGC.
at 23:33 you say reflect when it should be counter
revival blessing + leppa berry op
For comeuppance he probable meant to say counter instead of reflect. Or am I wrong?
22:22 top left??
Fun fact about double shock: if you terastalize into electric, you can keep using it
6:40 Wrong beat up exists ! Only used in singles I know but still
Imagine going against a ditto with imposter , in a multi battle, and using doodle.
20:45 had to go up against a I think 4 or 5 star tera ghost annihilape in a raid and like all they did was spam this move over and over. it was actual hell as literally everyone (I was playing with npcs) was getting one shot and yea sure I could've brought a normal type but annihilape could still hit them with fighting moves. I somehow ended up beating it through sheer luck.
Torch song is also affected by throat spray so you can get a plus two to special attack after your first use.
Gliave rush
mortal spin also removes entry hazards like spikes and rocks like rapid spin, thought that should be mentioned
Play now the best pokemon-like on Android "Conquest Civilizations"
Spicy Extract + Foul Play?
Scovilians move on a partner with defiant 👀
Twin Beam DOES break Sub/Sash/Sturdy though. F seems unfair.
Quaquaval's goes well with its Moxie. Speed it up and raise its attack and it can be a great sweeper!
11:08 not sure if you are aware but mortal spin also removes HAZARDS such as Stealth rock and Spikes.  maybe hazards aren't meta in vgc but that feels like an oversight not to mention.
11.24 this is the signature ability
The Meowscarada line not being able to learn pounce is extremely infuriating
wait so if Mausholdis holding a Wide Lens it'll hit 10 times all the time?
Double shock can actually become A tier if you tera electric pawnot, since he cant actually lose the electric typing due to the tera. So he can use the move over and over again
We need a metagross with gigaton hammer
Dude, grafaiai uses doodle when it’s with slaking…
slight oversight by wolfey with last respects houndstone has the abillity sand rush which can double speed in sandstorms making it a monster in competitve already being banned to ubers and thats not taking into account stab and tera but with stab the singles 300 base power goes to a monstrous 450 while the 200 base power in doubles/VGC goes to 300 and finally with tera adding onto those bonuses which if im not wrong doubles the power of moves and looking back to the singles 450 base power goes to 900 base power while the vgc base power of 300 goes to 600 and thats STILL not taking into account expert belt but what im saying here is houndstone can quite literally 1 shot anything if its tera, stab, sandstorm and using tyranitar is a easy way to set a monster up
Glee ave rush
So someone's running Pop Bomb + Ring Target Annihilape already, right?
Has anyone tried to switch the abilities of slaking or regigigas yet?
6:40 Well Beat-Up can hit up to 6 Times, but not in VGC, so basically slight correction.
Maushold to Uber when (also you forgor tidy up so meet me 6:60 in the back alley where I will bring 2 revival blessing Pokemon with leppa berry >:D
mortal spin is actually a poison type clone of rapid spin that also poisons the target. ive verified this myself
Tinkaton only has 75 bp, though
22:24 Gay Plant™
I actually like double shock a lot, I'm running electrin terrain with terrain extender pincurchin, iron valiant, and scarf pawmot. If you have electric terrain up, Tera into electric, you can effectively have a 312 base power attack because of the increased stab from terastilizing. On top of that, terastilizing into electric prevents pawmot from losing the electric typing so it can continue to use double shock
How about hitting your own anihalape with a mousehold s move Might have to use an item to be able to hit it, but imagine if every hit is a powerup for anahilape 550  power move
Yeah population bomb is kinda op in my opinion, it one shot my Toxapex with max def/max hp and perfect ivs just with the terra boost. For a neutral stab move against a defensive pokemon that is unacceptable. It's average damage is WAY above most 90% accuracy moves, it really need to be base 70 accuracy in my opinion.
Not mentioned but incredibly important, torch song is sound based, it bypasses substitute, making it a potential counter to the ridiculous move, shed tail
Love the Dance of Logical Reasoning background music from TGAA game from the first few minutes!
Actually  rage punch maxes out at 6 hits so you can get a max of 350  power. Its actually a tactic to have a partner pokemon smack the annihilape with beat up while it has weakness policy and laugh as Annihilape sweeps
Is chilly reception a reference to the second movie?
I miss your old intro
Kowtow Cleave is freakin amazeballs in practice tbh
Gigaton Hammer is THE greatest move ever added to Pokemon.
Correction, as the video showed, both effects of spicy extract affect the same target. You arent raising your attack and lowering their defense. You're raising THEIR attack and lowering their defense
17:49 . Correction: the HP of the substitute that the receiving pokemon acquires has 50% of either Cyclazar's or Orthworm's HP, depending of who used shed tail. So the move is even better than what Wolfey said
Glad to hear that Game Freak is garbage at balancing their official competitive format too, not just 6v6 singles like what all the VGC elitists would have you believe
Love your content! Please have these videos looked at by someone else for mistakes prior to publishing there are so many errors made in this one. Would prefer weekly uploads over these rushed videos.
when you pair double shock with electric tera, you won't loose your type and have a 120BP no drawback attack with 2x stab 🤔
Honestly, I like Tera Blast. I don't understand the people using it on a Dragapult when the terra ghost but meh. I have it on my fire tera Baxcalibur and it's an easy lure for Gholdengo. Which is like 90% of the games I play. So I think it's really good in that aspect. I've only played on showdown so far, but I like it is as a coverage move on my set up mon to counter the switch in. I'll admit I got Flying band Tyranitar on my Breloom switch and wanted to leave lol. I think it's fun. Would be nice for some sheer force mons too. Especially since it swaps between att and SPA. Then you don't have to run say rock slide on SPA Landorus.
My brotherino, Mortal Spin removes any form of hazard too
I feel like this video could have used a re-write/re-record session with how many corrections are slapped on top of the original footage
Rage fiat is the best
i wonder if Wolfey will cover how the Legends: arceus move and how they changed
Petition to call the boost you get for terastalizing a pokemon into a type it already is STTAB
You forgot Mausholds other signature attack tidy up which is basically dragon dance that removes hazards
My favorite is Rage Fist, I'm scared of Espathra's signature move
Is Revival Blessing + Leppa Berry viable? You'd be giving up an item slot, but I feel like trading that for two additional pokemon in battle would be mega worth
I made the exact same error with spicy extract, I thought it’d raise my stack and I was like oh shit this rocks I’m gonna make my guy a phys sweeper, then I used it realized what it did and went 😑
Mortal spin also gets rid of your sides hazards like spikes
Lol I like the Ace Attorney music on the Pokémon video
He missed Tidy Up, Mauhold's other signature move
Wolf how about tidy up, normal type dd and clears hazards
Ruination... wasn't Raticate's Hyper Fang the same thing?
Filet away is a significantly worse shell smash, exclusive to a terrible pokemon. I don't think there's any scenario where you would prefer halved hp over 1 stage of defenses down. Also you can white herb shell smash to have no negative effects. Best you can do with filet away is sitrus berry to 80%...
Reflect = Counter now
I'm surprised nobody uses leppa berry with revival blessing. Technically you get 2 moves outta it as long as you have the health. Just make the health odd numbered so when it gets cut in half it should end up with 1hp
Revival Blessing Rabsca + Choice Scarf Annihilape seems to be pretty evil combo. On paper! Cos I never seen that during Ranked Battles
saltcure is op
Does rage fist stack off of doubles team attack? If so we have a problem.
some statistics on population bomb by the way, it has an average base power of 133.43
Get Wolfey to 1 Million 👏
if you use doodle with a slaking, on like a pokemon with moxie. it could be quite broken imo
Wugtrio + Triple Dive & Palosand + Water Compaction + Weakness Policy... test it.
You missed one important detail about Gigaton Hammer. You said that you can get around the next turn issue with Protect. However, Gigaton Hammer’s only drawback is that you cannot use it twice in a row—not that you can’t use any OTHER attack on the next turn. There’s no need to Protect on the next turn if you have other effective attacking moves, which Tinkaton does (Foul Play, Brick Break, Play Rough, etc)
In pve, Salt Cure is S. You can take down any pokemon with a Sturdy Naclstack and lots of  max potions.
Spicy Extract could be good combined with Unburden White Herb Maybe? Idk
you could tera allialape into like a rock or steel type then use population boom on it for absolutlely broken amounts of damage from rage fist. correct me if im wrong
Revival blessing with leppa berries?
I would put Bitter Blade in S Tier because you can attach Life Orb to Ceruledge and make it a 120 base damage AND negate Life Orbs drawback at the same time, basically giving it the power of Armarouge's signature move but without the Defense drop.
I had a BRILLIANT IDEA... Use Revival Blessing on your Tatsugiri after making sure it faints in Dondozo's mouth, essentially ensuring Dondozo gets another set of sharp stat boosts, and then sweep like a boss!!!!  But I tried it on Showdown, and it doesn't work... :( Dondozo thinks Tatsugiri's still in its mouth. Sad day
......Why are you calling counter reflect.  you have infinite time and ability to catch these mistakes you also refer to grass surge as grass terrain at least twice.   how do you fuck up this badly?
I like the idea of Shift Gear + Spin Out Revavroom
I see why you'd put rock salt in c tier but honestly it's good because while it may not always confirm a faint if it doesn't it forces the swap out so you can use it to force changes in the opponents layout giving a chance to regain the traction you need
Imagine stealing shedinja’s ability
Fun little fact population bomb is insanely overpowered as if you use scope lens it will do 200 base damage with 10 1% times to miss but mousehold can have technician making it a move with a base 300 power
21:18 I remember "foofootoo" was experimenting with Rage Fist. It appears to have a 5 hit limit for 300 base power. They theorized Weakness Policy, Beat Up is a good set up for Anhilape.
Mister Wolfey could you trade me a random pokemon that you caught, just so I keep it safe for me? I would be super happy! 😁
I think you missed tidy up
Just like "Reflect" and Mirrorcoat lol😂
Do you know how Double Shock (or Burn Up) interact with terastalization? Will the move fail on a non-electric terastalized Pawmot? Will an electric terastalized Pawmot remain electric?
bEaT uP hItS sIx tImEs iF yOu HaVe A fUlL pArTy
I think Spicey Extract does deserve at least a B for it's uses against opposing Sp Attackers as well as the ability to boost an ally and Scovillian with mirror herb. This move does have the potential to be very useful when paired with a physical attacker under sun with Chlorophyll Scoviallian lowering an opponents defense and then followed up with an attack to finish them off.
Turns out Larry has one of the best moves in the game
You forgeted Tidy up, the other signature from Mousehold that is a Dragon Dance which also clear hazards
What if I use population bomb on anhilape , will it's power increase to 550?
I think every individual hit of triple dive has chance to flinch
Rage fist + drain punch is a deadly combo
Population Bomb works exactly like Triple axel, so with Wide lents you are almost guaranteed to hit those 10 hits
i really like doodle i have been running it with a bulky slaking. bulk up, amnesia drain punch and tera blast dark you can get rid of truant and get; prankster for setting up, mirror body to bonus back stat lowering effects or Intimidate to double lower attack, basically it heavily depends on what your facing but i tend to find the same pokemon or at least the same abilities and with Tera dark i'm prankster immune. whilst it might not be great in the best of three you have four other pokemon to help out and even if they know what you're doing you build up stats fast enough not to matter.
It doesn’t say it for whatever reason but Mortal Spin also removes hazards just like rapid spin does. So it’s a fair bit better in singles
Mixing Reflect counter hurt my head
They added a ton of moves with switch out effects this gen, really trying to push people toward using palafin with its hero form
Doodle on slaking and regigigas would be op , this move alone will bring many unused overpowered Pokemon(due to bad abilities) to use
Yeah spicy extract is worse swagger
Someone used doodle on my elektross to get levitate before my tyranitar used earthquake. That was the biggest brained shit I ever saw
Population Bomb is IT!
Slowpoke should have Shed tail.
Seriously Rage Fist on by Speed Nature Annihilape saved me in so many storyline fights where I went somewhere early and was underleveled by like 15-20. That decent typing and decent bulk and spamming Revives if needed and the reliable out-speeding was a godsend that let my team punch over it's paygrade and make up for the poor coverage I had at times.  I mean when that move gets rolling type matchups sstop mattering as much lol.
Think you forgot tidy up😅 Broken move btw
These are your best kind of videos. I like the half-scripted ones, good balance between info and personality
Torch Song also procs Throat Spray, meaning you can get a SECOND Sp Atk boost using the move only 1 time, effectively doubling your Sp Atk in one turn while still doing damage. In Tera Raids, I've found myself just spamming Torch Song for increased damage all the way up to 6 Sp Atk boosts. Even if the raid Pokemon's tera type isn't weak to fire, this move still pumps.
Twin beam in F tier? Both hits have a chance to crit which actually makes it stronger than psychic if both hit for critical damage
Ceruledge with Bitterblade also just makes Life Orb funny, because its so easy to just slash back up to full health, before taking the Lorb damage, rinsing and repeating
maybe wanted to take a little bit longer on this one, it's incredibly riddled with mistakes.
It's always fun watching Wolfey's analyses because I realize it's from a Doubles perspective.  Seeing Mortal Spin rated D hurt my soul but only because I've been playing Singles lately.  That being said it DOES hit both targets with a guaranteed poison...which is still too slow but better than thought, maybe. Obviously, the effect of moves like Mortal Spin removing hazards, Axe Kick being weak to Protect, or even Glaive Rush encouraging a follow up Protect means far more spicy (good *or* bad) results in Singles. Personally I think Spicy Extract is underrated as a concept - you can use it to weaken a target and combo much like Lumina Crash for the physical side *or* you can buff your ally in exchange for defensive staying power.  It's got versatility and I like that.  Unfortunately, Scovillain looks bad outside of sun (which makes me sad cuz I like him a lot) so it probably won't be used either way. I can't wait for Dudunsparce's reign over the metagame (smile)
Rage fist does seem to have a cap of damage either at 350 so 6 hits caps it out. So using beat up on it gets you there with 6 Pokémon. Thanks to foofootoo
Mortal spin is a rapid spin that poisons your opponent, that's great. I've seen it on lots if not most Glimmoras
Spicy extract should burn
Population Bomb can be very powerful if Maushold has Technician as their ability.   Either Wide or Zoom lens can make it more accurate to make sure it hits way more or an item like Kings Rock to flinch lock a major threat in place of it works.
I wish tinkaton was stronger for using Gigaton hammer. I wanted the gremlin doll on my team but its stats are so underwhelming it makes me upset
Wait, Wolfy, doesn’t Mortal Spin also remove entry hazards like Toxic Spikes and Rocks?   Because that means it couldn’t be blocked by ghosts any longer with that poison typing, right?
23:33 - 23:48 That guy on the 3rd floor of Celadon Department Store is crying and shaking
I mean, with spicy extract, you can use it on one of your other pokemon while it goes for an attacking move to have an attack and stat boost at the same time, or with swords dance to pretty much have a double swords dance in one turn, but the -2 defence may be a big drawback, although you could run a white herb
Bitter blade pairs well with swords dance. Using it on my play through now
Imagine we had smeargle in this gen....
Hope people that listen to this won't think that Wolfey actually meant "reflect" when he was talking about the move comeuppance, it's more like Counter.
What do you think of Pachirisu in this first season?
Cyclizar shed tail is for singles. Orthworm shed tail is for doubles.
You missed Tidy Up, Maushold's other signature move
on double shock if you are terrasilized it remains electric type and you can keep using it.
If population bomb wasn’t normal type pering it with anialabe would be gamebreaking
6:33 Can't Beat Up hit 6 times?
Ran the numbers on population bomb and without any accuracy boosts it will hit 10 times 34% (or just over 1/3) of the time. On top of that the chance of hitting  6 times is 53%. The power of this move can't be understated.
Did you guys know that if u tera into an electric type with double shock you can keep using it
As someone that used Annihilape in my Scarlet play through, I can confirm Rage Fist is AMAZING
Wow, there's so many signature moves this gen.
Tera annihilape, population bomb and revival blessing could be a potential combo then?
Give a pokemon with revieval blessing a leppa Barry (Sorry if i Said the wrong Barry) and it Can now revieve twice
If you’re terra electric you can use double shock multiple times
12:00 this could be really good with slaking
Helpful video
Wenn you give Maushold a kings rock its basicly unstopable
DONdozo, not dodonzo.
Salt Cure is actually a pretty good Move. I would give a B atleast tbh. Its especially good in Competitive.
Grafaiai and slaking. That's all I'm saying.
Ayee you got me crack up! You deserve a sub xD  Man i like how you kept coming back from the future to explain some of the skill.
Torch song dude you have to trust me it the best starter move
A question about an old move: Curse. If you terastalize into a ghost type or out of the ghost type, would the effect of the move change accordingly?
Quick correction: Rage Fist does indeed have an upper limit, but it's 300, so it's still incredibly strong
spicy extract could be funny to set up foul play
With order up I'm pretty sure you can use it without tatsuguri on the field, you just don't get the additional effects from tatsuguri
Smeargle is smiling silently
Bu-but Mortal Spin removes hazards and poisons both targets
It's Glaive, as in Glayv. Not Glee-ev.
I wanted to say a really cool rule for revival blessing in HC nuzlockes imo is to allow it to revive a Pokemon, but only for that battle. So it gives a dying Pokemon one last stand before falling.
You should specify that moves grading for double battles because you graded so low for moves that are too good in single battles and some moves or pokemon which are only good in doubles
Wolf from the future saved me from the spicy failure lol
Okay analysis video! Thanks for uploading!
Uhhh beat up your own Annihilape in doubles?
I've been wondering if I had a jolteon with pin missile and hit my own annihilape if that would make rage fist pretty strong. I don't know if this necessarily works, but I think this would be amazing if does.  I love your wideos
"If Pokemon like Volcarona..." FIERY DANCE!!!!!
If you use Double Shock, and then Tera Electric, would you get the Electric type back and gain a second use of the attack?
Hyperdrill being the most anime attack in existence, but is laid on most non-anime pokemon, makes it even better
Wait if you use spicy extract on a confused opponent and they hit that can do some good damage and could pair well with a Mon who knows axe kick
Reflect and mirror coat? Don't you mean counter and mirror coat?
Double shock DOESNT remove electric typing if you are terastalized
Ur not wrong about rage fist. I annihilape can solo about 90% of ALL raids. He’s absolutely broken.
Collision Course > Electro Drift because 3 more types are weak to fighting than electric
Who cares about ruination? that shit is banned. Old video recycling detected
Where is our best  Terratype for each Pokemon Vid? Is it no that straight f0rward?
Spicy extract is just screech with complications, what a weird choice
No!! Your hair it’s cute ♥️
4:10 that should be ‘has been’, you’ve shown yourself that the Tatsugiri doesn’t even need to be alive anymore for it to work
Good metric is how much more annoying Zacian or Incineroar would be if they had that move
Gigaton Hammer hitting for 160 and can’t be used next turn reads like an attack in the card game
Glee-ave Rush?  Wouldn't it be Glay-ve.  I'm honestly just not sure, but my brain thought it was the latter.  I really dislike Wugtrio....
Shed tail ftw
Do a video about your opnion on the new pokemon like a tierlist or something
Wolfey, King's rock is a new item that gives pokemon a 10% chance  to flinch their opponents if their move doesn't flinch. Meaning that if you raise maushold's accuracy, then that becomes a 100% chance.  It also learns beat up so ghosts are not that good of a counter.
10:30 we got a new Phil Swift.
Is the aniliape move every time they get hit or every time they lose hp because..... population bomb?
Salt cure is the MVP move for the Titans storyline. You can cheese all titan fights with it before any gym fights with just this move
I'm assuming you mean COUNTER and Mirror Coat as Reflect is a screen setup move
Mortal Spin is decent, clears hazards. This is a note for singles, since to my knowledge hazards aren't common in VGC
silk trap is a great example of a move that isn't king's shield lol
Tbh this is more of a question on a Pokémon not really on what I think of a move. Could clodsire be good? It can learn spikes and toxic spikes, typically has water absorb as an ability thus removing its water weakness and it can also learn moves via tm like trailblaze it also learns through level up amnesia. Some drawbacks could be it’s speed though
Reflect and mirror coat? I think you ment Counter and mirror coat
what you said about filet away is not quite right, it takes away 50% hp just like belly drum not 25%. also just like belly drum it raises your stats with +6 but devided into 3 different stats
Don't know if you got the notice, but Burn Up and Double Shock don't remove your type if you're Tera'd into this type, making them spammable 🙃
Make it rain is astral barrage with a drawback
22:22 Gay Plant
PLEASE MAKE A REALLY DUMB TEAM WITH REVIVAL BLESSING IT'D BE SO FUNNY TO SEE PEOPLE RAGE QUIT AFTER YOU REVIVE A SHEDINJA
ragefist and population bomb existing in the same game is super scary. That's probably why they made annihilape ghost type. But is eviolite primape a viable strat?
the revive move could actualy be broken even more you can use it 2 times during an battle if you give the one who has the move the leppa berry..  mm might be good for smeargle to get
The geniality behind “chilling reception” tho
im sorry, Lumina Crash is EIGHTY base power!?! i really like doodle, though the similarity to smeargle makes me wonder what it'd be like if grafaiai instead was able to permanently steal an ability like smeargle permanently steals moves. still, love to see slaking viability.
Reflect is now counter at 23:38
Can Smeargle learn Revival Blessing? If so....
Wide Lense Population Bomb is the Nuzzle Pachirisu of 2023, I'm calling it now...
Already 3 moves in and I can see you speak bullshit with your ratings/votes.
Wide lens.
Salt Cure continues even after the user switches out, which makes it way better than other binding moves. I think it’s an A tier move.
23:38 *counter and mirror coat
I don't play pokemon but from my experience in pretty much any game revive mechanics are a no-no they always turn out completly useless or incredibly overpowered
salt cure doesint go away from the pokemon afflicted by the dot dmg, so when you switch back in that pokemon it will still have salt cure.
A bit surprised Tera blast isn't a bit higher bc it's a flex physical/special move as well
Doodle actually makes slaking and regigias useful so yeah, it can be b+
Wouldn't Twin Beam basically be a 120 base power move? It's 60 base due to stab and it hits twice. Unless I am missing something, Twin Beam is actually a really good move.
With spicy extract you could activate moxie
You forgot one: Tidy Up, the other of Maushold's signature moves. It removes entry hazards and substitutes from both sides of the field (don't know about screens) AND gives Maushold +1 to Attack and Speed.  On its own, I'd say it's just Dragon Dance but better since you also get rid of subs, however since Maushold is too frail to set up, it probably won't see much use.
Aqua step plus moxie quaquaval. I mean you dont even need to set up
Counter not reflect*
You mean counter not reflect @ 23:47
9:46 you can actually bypass the 1 pp by using sleep talk it gives you an additional 16 pp to the move (that is if sleep talk makes you use revival blessing every time)
Salt cure is actually really good in competitive, being able to do consistent damage forever until they switch out is broken. It’s also great for forcing the opponent to switch out and waste a turn
I’m pretty sure mortal spin is a poison type version of rapid spin so it removes entry hazards (e.g. stealth rock, sticky web, etc) as well as poisoning the opponent. It should be a much higher tier move than D.
21:06 "Switching out, or fainting does *not* reset it's counter." I'm sorry, it WHAT!?
Uh Mortal spin also clears hazards. So for Glimora its just a better rapid spin. So very good  Fillet away is half your HP. So its a psuedo belly drum.
At 23:40 you are wrong. You say reflect and mirror coat. It is reflect and light screen which half the damage received. And COUNTER and mirroar coat which return back double the damage. I think you have mistaken counter for reflect. It happens all the time. All good
how could they not give ice spinner to baxcalibur when the distribution is so wide and the tm recipe requires frigibax scales 😭
You did say they could switch with Salt Cure. but damage is still Damage, using the move again predicting a switch would do extra damage as well. And its a Rock Type move as well. And because of the damage over time, it would either force a switch or force the target to take out Garganical, either way. Damage will happen. since Salt Cure sticks arround even if Garganical is taken out, kinda like Leech Seed, so Salt Cure can be baton passed.
Why do you say say signature ablity not move
Tera Blast is a B, Wolfe. Giving any Pokémon a Tera type STAB attack when a lot of solid Tera types don't have coverage on the mon is really valuable. And it also checks your strongest offensive stat, so even less limiting. It's a B. Not C.
Correction on Rage Fist, it maxes out at 300 damage :)
What happens if you tera electric and use double shock?
Shouldn't it be houndstone, not greavard who learns last respects at 2:39
Those moves can really help the compeninive game huh
Salt cure was a great move to cheese the titans with early
If spicy extract was what wolfe originally thought, itd be the best move ever
Mousehold hmmmmmmmmm give it kings rock flinch pokemon signature move hits 10 times if not missing can be broken.
Can pawmot not eat a leppa berry to refill the pp ?
You kept saying abilities instead of move
15:41 the Carkol in the background getting omniboosted from Ancient Power lmao
Rage fist does have a upper limit of 300 so only the first five hits increase the damage for rage fist
So silk trap is a good move, if only it was on a good pokemon
I think mortal spin is better then what you’re giving it credit for, the ability to clear hazards like spikes or stealth rock while also poisoning your opponent and doing a small bit of damage is really useful, i think it’s b tier at least or a tier
regigigas or slaking with grafaiai doodle would be broken.
Twin Beam isn't bad! It's basically a psychic dual wingbeat. Not very powerful, but useful against subs and sashes.
IDK about competitive, but I KOd Iron tusks at lv 20 thanks to salt cure lol
So according to this list, what team should I use in PvP?
#29 on trending in gaming, lets go Wolfey!!
11:30 hmmm wonder guard?
9:40 revival blessing with leppa berry while using both of its pokemon basically revives an entire team :D
moushold kings rock would be op
Wolfey, if you see those errors while editing, why don't you remove them in the first place instead of bringing in future wolfey? Also, there are a few uncaught errors with the special moves of Veluza, Dondozo and Koraidon
Swords dance 3x + bitter blade = lol raids easy
Doesn't mortal spin have the same effect as rapid spin? Like, it can knock away hazards too? Forgive me if I'm wrong, i just saw it knocks off leech seed and has "spin" in the name so i assumed lol
Uses revival blessing, then uses copycat
Wait, medicham learns axe kick? I thought it was lokix's signature move lmao
I think that Bitter Blade is significantly better in practice than in theory, because it's a STAB fire type attack on a mon with Flash Fire in a metagame where you can make the STAB bonus 2x instead of 1.5x. As long as Ceruledge isn't deleted in a turn, there is a very real chance it just kills whatever it's facing and heals back up to full, especially in sun
I feel like the "Wolf from the future segments" could have just replaced the info you got wrong from the original recording. Having you tell us the wrong thing and then immediately correct yourself was kind of annoying and pointless tbh.  I get that you're churning out a lot of content right now while SV is fresh and new but it just comes across as lazy editing. My feedback on your video isn't all sour though - I appreciate the work you put into the info in this video. Very useful insight, thanks Wolfey :)
11:24 Wouldn’t you be able to copy intimidate and instantly lower both opponents’ attack, or is this not viable? Edit: I didn't realise that he brought it up later like 10 seconds later
With double shock you can terrarilze and continue to use it
23:23 don't worry Wolfey, they will be giving the dog a hammer once home drops
Rage fist THANKFULLY caps out at 350, still strong as all hell but at least it can't go into the thousands or anything lol
I’ve been running swords dance ceruledge, can make bitter blade a complete and utter weapon, bonus points if you can manage to take two hits and get 2 swords dances off then the Tera fire. Bonus points for a focus sash so once you’re one shotting everything they have to get two OHKO’s off w Pokémon faster than yours.  A bit of luck involved, plus it’s slightly finicky, but if you can set it up properly then it’s really really fun to go Tera fire and get off massive attacks. With full speed and attack EV’s it sweeps the majority of casual players if successfully set up.   It’s hard to get set up though so it’s not a broken strat or anything, it’s just incredibly fun whenever you can get the plan to unfold.
23:48 counter* and mirror coat
You saying that Order Up is Dragon type when Dondozo isn't made me realize that it's Dragon type because you're serving Tatsugiri which is Dragon type.
what if you're Tera Electric can you always use Double Shock?
goated soundtrack choice editor, fucking love that game
Does loaded dice work with mausholds move?
Saw a video of somebody testing Rage Fist, and it does seem to cap after about six attacks.
Last Reapects is a B???? Are you braindead
population bomb: this is the first move in history that can hit more than five times beat up: am i a joke to you?
you do realize that silk trap only protects from damaging moves? it's definitely not "protect, but better"
i think you underrated salt cure. if you play around it, iron defense recover garganacl with salt cure can just stall 2v1s until both opponents die. it’s not S tier, but i would put it at high b low a
Wolfy, if you're gonna tell people to not use Revival Blessing when playing you, they'll use it
I got a new gimmick I'm bringing to the table. Feels free and steal. Am proud of this once.  DunDunsparce set to tank mode. 252 in health and spc def. Run coil, agility (up for change), rest, and baton pass. Hold a chesto berry to cure his own sleep for free once. Baton pass into just about anything broken ATM. Baton pass that shit into Palafin or Maushold for all I care. The only trick is switching into a squishy pokemon if you're boosting speed. Which is why I'm on the fence with agility. Coil helps with the switch in, boosting def, but if they're running a special attack fighting type, this plan won't work.
Can every Pokémon become other Pokémon by having a partner with Doodle and copying Ditto’s ability? That’s would be funny as hell
Me using electric terra to choice band double shock EHEHEHE
Pawmot is going to be a good support that just about everyone is going to sleep on.  It gets Nuzzle, Revival Blessing. Fake Out, Sweet Kiss and Wish.
Even wolfey thinks dondozo is dodonzo lmao
11:13 mortal spin also removes entry hazards like stealth rocks, which imo makes it way better than D tier
As someone using ceruledge, i can say that bitter blade and sword dance can sweep almost everything, so the only counter i know is: ,,Flash fire" and ,,well Baked body"     Ps. Terastalization boosts fire attack so this with sunny day... It's broken
Mortal spin removes hazard too so
I’m also so powerful that they gave me only one pp
You didn't mention slaking in the doodle move
#27 on trending for gaming let’s go!!!
I love how he said spicy extract increases the users attack while at the same time he showed a clip of it being used and did the opposite
Do you think lowkix hidden ability will make any kind of splash in competitive?
Foofootoo tested out the limits of Rage Fist and the upper limit seems to be 350 base power
Hyper Drill has to be my favorite of the new moves. Not only is it good, but it's what gives me the glorious evolution that is Dudunsparce 🥹
I disagree with this list... A lot actually, I think salt cure is big because it forces a switch, with that switch you can set up stronger, I know the tier list is based on competitive doubles but some moves are good in singles and bad in doubles and the other way around, but there are moves that are fantastic, some of this I dont agree but I dont disregard your experience
I feel like this video was rushed, he keeps making mistakes with move descriptions, calling moves, “abilities”, mixing up moves like “counter” for “reflect” and idk, I feel like time wasn’t taken to be certain about rankings but still appreciate the video regardless 💕
Slaking Doodle combo?????😊
Mortal spin is like rapid spin no? A really good move?
You called attack ability so many times
Spin Out gonna go crazy with Trick Room
I know a lazy gorilla that would love to change its ability and attack every turn
22:23 On the top left.
Spicy extract will soon click for Wolfe
Because of technition pounce's base power being 50 is actually a good thing.
Get dudunsparse.  Name it gurren lagann.  🤣
@ editor: i appreciate the great ace attorney music :)
has anyone tested if rage fist can be affected by a partner's population bomb? just theorizing if a ring target Annihilape could be op (ring target bc it's ghost type and pop bomb is normal type)...
Commenting for Algorithm have a great day wolfeVGC
I appreciate Wolfe using Pokémon Conquest music for the background
That's why you make Tinkatuff adamant and give it all the protein it can stomach. Gives it respectable attack. Around 90 base if i'm not mistaken. Then that move becomes cartoonish lol
I would find Gigaton hammer a lot harder to get around when the Pokemon who has it also has Swords Dance. So you can play some mind games by baiting out the protect and going for Swords Dance instead.
Nice pokemon conquest music around 14 minutes in B)
Double shock doesn't take away your electric type if you terastalize. So Tera electric Pawmot can spam a zero downside 120 BP stab move.
Aqua Step is problematic when you combine it with Quaquaval's Hidden Ability Moxie.
Annihiliape has 4x resistance to bug. Pin missile is a bug type multihit move. Half considering jolteon partner who (1) learns pin missile (2) has weak base attack (3) outspeeds annihilape to immediately bump rage fist to stupid levels of damage in the first turn
Doesn’t mortal spin remove entry hazards? Also I think rage fist has a limit of 350 power.
Wouldnt spicy extract be good to support a physical sweeper with defiant like Kingambit or Annihilape? Its a +4, right?   Update: it doesn't work because defiant only works from stat reduction from an opponent, not an ally
How is mortal spin like D tier lmao, thats one of the best singles mons right now and all the sets run it
It feels like a lot of new signature moves pair up well with new abilities... But most of the time they aren't both the signature of the same Pokemon. Like Last Respects is absolutely broken if used with Supreme Overlord. Too bad both are signature to different Pokemon. Purifying Salt or Good As Gold would both work well with Rage Fist, preventing a lot of extra damage sources that don't boost Rage Fist like Poison or Burn, but again, all signature to different Pokemon. As such, however, I feel that means that there might be a lot more strategies that involve changing abilities. I already know Doodle has a combo with Slaking, removing Truant to make Slaking more powerful, and just about any ability is better than Truant. But imagine setups that could give Houndstone Supreme Overlord, or Annihilape Purifying Salt (reducing its weakness to Ghost and making it immune to most statuses). Obviously some of these setups might require Smeargle to get the correct move setup, otherwise you need to rely on your opponent having the right ability on their Pokemon, but still, I could see someone figuring out how to make it work
Population bomb + kings rock = flinch City
idk i feel like Mortal Spin can be really good if you also run Venoshock on Glimmora...being able to guarantee poison + release binding moves, hazards, and leech seed, it's basically a poison rapid spin with slightly weaker power (however with STAB it's just barely stronger) that guarantee poisons the opponent.  I actually have Glimmora with toxic debris and stealthrock, mortal spin, and venoshock (focus sashed) combo'd into Iron Moth with Venoshock holding choice scarf...basically if my opponent isn't prepared at all for toxic spikes (somehow given there's numerous ways to counter them) I basically guarantee a sweep because Scarfed Iron Moth basically outspeeds everything that isn't scarfed + double stab frokm tera type, double damage venoshock is basically enough to kill almost anything in one hit besides sturdy and sashed mons (then poison can kill).  This is only a strat that i have on a conpetitive tem that i think would be fun to play, not a hardcore competitive team that'd be able to get far in ranked.  Still, though, Mortal Spin i'd personally put at around B...high B, low A around there.  Again, just my opinion.
21:04 hey so rage fist has a limit and it caps at 350 BP so no 1000+ BP cheese
Imagine level 1 maushold with widelense smacking an annihilape
One more thing about population bomb. If Maushold is holding a King's rock has just under a 60% chance of causing a flinch.
With double shock, you could terastilise into electric type and use again
Tera Ghost Annihilape with Weakness Policy and a partner with Beat Up.  (It does have a limit, btw.  Rage Fist can only get 6 stacks for a total 350 base power.) Twin Beam shouldn't be F.  It has the niche of breaking Focus Sash and Sturdy.
i may be wrong but im PRETTY sure that the cap for base power of rage fist is 350. i saw a video testing it a couple days ago and im pretty sure thats it?
spicy extract could work well with a partner that knows foul play 🌶
I just realized that if you use a pp up on revival blessing. You can revive more of your Pokémon during battle
Revival Blessing in playthroughs is just a singular use free revive In competitive it’s broken because there are no revives in competitive
Doodle + slacking for the memes. I'm 100% sure that once the tiers shake out on Showdown, you're going to see a lot of low level doubles games being run by Slacking and the snot monkey.
Time to take twin beam off my Farigiraf 😅
10:06 how the hell did pawmot get this move???
I think Nintendo made this game as a shitpost
It would be a funny strat if you could go to a 4v4 with the other 2 pokemon dead, amd then use Last respects
Imagine you try to use Population Bomb and they switch into something with Rough Skin/Iron Barbs or a Rocky Helmet.
The way Wolfey pronounces "glaive" is dealing me super-effective psychic damage.
Rage fist, terrastal ghost, beat up, weakness policy annihilape… I am scared
23:32 Reflect? My pal I think you meant Counter
Make it Rain. GHOLDENGO IS A B*TCHASS MF
Pawmot can learn wish as an egg move so you can revival blessing into wish to bring back something much stronger than pawmot
Is Flower Trick weaker than Torch Song and Aqua Step because it always crits?
rabsca cannot learn u-turn but pawmot can learn volt switch. do with that info what you will.... god help tournament players i expect to see orthworm with the shed tail and an EQ user to match. maushold with wide scope is scary dudunsparce is scary rage fist mixed with a pawmot would be insane garganacl i expect to see because of orthworm counter skeledirge with trick room sounds OP.
This is from a casual, so take it with a grain of salt:  Flower Trick is broken. Base 70, plus the crit, then (I believe) STAB/Tera kicks in, as well as the option to equip a Miracle Seed, if not a Choice Band. I can't math well, I'll admit, but that has to be over 200 power.
Beat up hits 6 times in 6v6
Doesn't Mortal Spin also clear entry hazards? It should be rated higher just for that. But a Poison-type version of Nuzzle is pretty good anyway imo
Looking good man
wolfe from the "less distant past" cause this is still a video... or you could just say editing wolfe.
While it's restricted, I think Revival Blessing would be really powerful in conjunction with Power Construct Zygard.
Imagine a Poison Orb Annihilape in a comp match
Singles player here. Don't know if anyone mentioned it in the comments but last respects is so overpowered, it got houndstone banned in our most competitive format.
Give maushold kings rock...it sounds funny
I don't often comment on pronunciation, but I can't pass over you pronouncing glaive as "glee-ave". It's pronounced "glayv", one syllable, it's a type of polearm weapon like a halberd or pike.
torch song throat spray is a free nasty plot that sweeps in game and i hope in competitive
Like man can you um like totally react to the  list of banned Pokemon that like just came out. Um like thanks and um yes I totally am making fun of how you talk because it's like ya know funny. (In all seriousness I love the video and your content keep it up and I hope I made you laugh)
Beat up ragefust
*2 hit move that can kill past sturdy and hit past sub.*  "Worse then psychic and psyshock . F"  I hate this man
Doodling an enemy to overwrite Regigigas' ability is quite interesting to try out.
why does everyone pronounce dondozo as dodonzo LOL
Sciszor has pounce and technician
Rage fist + bullet seed
Chilly Reception is amazing because it weaponizes being a misunderstood comedic genius
I thought rage fist had a upper limit of 350.
Electro Drift is actually even better than Collision Course because it also gets boosted by the Electric Terrain that Miraidon’s ability sets up
Wait is Orthworm good?
Filled Away, I used it and swept the entire fighting team star. For a playthrough it was super fun to use.
Revavroom using Gear Shift -> Spin Out -> Spin Out -> Gryo Ball is really impractical, but very cool lorewise lol
Magnezone will be back to its best steel trapping days now,it will terrastalize into fire type and blast past ferrothorn.On the other hand I think Ferro and Skarm will terrastalize to ground typing to get upper hand on magnezone
Spicy Extract might be a good niche against walls? Like the Chansey or Shuckle etc. pitiful attacking stats but overwhelming defense
Leading with Slaking and Hidden Ability Prankster Grafaiai and using doodle on enemy ceruledge to copy flash fire to both grafaiai and slaking.... yeh that was exactly what happened to me on my first match in ranked on December 1st.
Wait why does Meowscarada get chilling water lol
Scovillain got done dirty here despite Clear Amulet being a real thing. 😭
I found that throwing the Throat Spray on Skeledirge adds another stage once Torch Song is used, two stages for the price of one!
So Fun fact about Double Shock; if you Terastalize into an electric type and use that move, you actually negate the type loss effect that usually occurs after using the move, meaning you can spam it as long as you're terastalized into an electric type.
I disagree with Mortal Spin, it can have a niche where you might get taunted because the opponent predicts hazards or Toxic. And instead you just poison them anyway. The damage is negligible especially as a physical move on a special attacker, but that's not what it's there for, it's to bypass Taunt
6:40 wrong lmao beat up can hit up to 6 times and its from before gen 9
Woe, Gigaton Hammer be upon ye
My favourite part was future wolfey
Annihilape theory: build it with more hp or defense or something, hit it with beat up repeatedly, revive bless if necessary, commit war crimes, profit.
I’d like to hear Wolfe’s updated thoughts on the Hisuian Pokémon now that we know their updated abilities, movepools, and the way their signature moves work in S/V, but I guess we’ll have to wait until Home integration drops since I don’t think he talks about datamined info.
Comeuppance is similar to COUNTER and Mirror Coat, not Reflect. Cheers
@WolfeyVGC  In Competitive Singles, Salt Cure is super strong because you can spam it with Garganacl and deal heavy damage to all opponent’s Pokémon. Even after knocking out Garganacl, you lost 1/8 of your health, and if you don’t switch out, you take more damage, and if you do, you give your opponent a mostly obvious free turn.
Its a jam when you have Pokemon Masters music playing in the background. Also, yay fighting types gets a move that allows them to just hit really really hard~
imagine if this worked: annahilape and maushold, maushold population bombs annahilape, then gets revived by a pawmi or something maybe make annaihilape rock or steel as well
12:00 isn't this literally the same as using growl? gen 2 headass
Glee Ayv Rush
Imagine a tinkaton with gigaton hammer paired with a physical attacker that knows mimic. Scary.
ice spinner was actually a pleasant addition that I put on my azumarill
you said ability more then move?
First start with a beat up annihilape. You now have a 250 base power move. When annihilape dies, just revive it. This was a well thought out and perfectly balanced combination.
11:12  i would like to honestly disagree. for a pokemon like glimmora which should be used as a setter. having a 100% toxic that can also do damage on the way and remove setups from itself isnt that bad.    i would put it on high C or low B personally. IT IS a better version of toxic
23:32 its counter, not reflect goof ball
101% Accuracy what's the extra one For 😆😂
6:35 iirc in 6v6 singles Beat Up can hit 6 times
Mortal Spin is at least a Rapid Spin not blocked by Ghost
Will Revival Blessing allow you to do the Tatsugiri/Toxic Orb thing twice on Dodonzo?
My reaction to hearing what Hyper Drill does: “WHAT?! WHAT THE FU-“
You should've specified that the grades are based on competitive Pokemon. Salt Cure is S tier for PvE in my book, especially boss fights.
You misread what spicy extract does: It functions more like swagger. Both effects are applied to the target. This makes the ability highly risky to use in single battles
Tera blast should just be the type your pokemon can tera into it would help with coverage so much mut would need a power nerf to like 75 or 70
Thank you bro I tell you to do a video about new moves
Spicy Extract is good if you run Clear Amulet or Clear Body on a partner, or if the partner is pretty fragile (i.e. Pheromossa), and can also be used to weaken Special Mons the target controls.
Comeuppance takes less prediction than it says if your mon has a good speed stat since it works on whatever last did damage to it to deal boosted damage, not necessarily in the same turn
Hi Jump Kick does more damage than Axe Kick, so it's automatically better.
in game mortal spin is perfect for catching pokemon
Population bomb hits 10 times, beat up hits 6 times
if revival blessing restores pp, you could have a chain
electric tera type on pawmi allows you to chain double shock
Not wolfey forgeting that flower trick also never misses  Also collision course would be 200 for a super effective attack because stab as long as it's not tarastalized I to a non fighting type or at all
Could double shock be used and the next turn could you tera into electric. Or could you use it with tera to keep your electric type?
last respects and jet punch not immediate S  u ok
Spin Out then Gyro Ball
Reflect and Mirror Coat
Im really happy to see so much content from you lately Wolfey, I'm sure u are working hard to get us good content on a 2 day basis and for that im greatful, thank u man!! Keep it up!!   but pls don't overwork urself <3
A mon with 110 base HP, good defenses, immune to fake out, that resists rock slide, which both defiant and vital spirit as abilities, and gets stronger every time it gets hit? Yeah, sure. That doesn't look broken at all!
Tera Blast is great on normal types! One can get stab on it regardless that way ;)
I’m just saying, a weak attacking high defensive stats moushold with a raised accuracy using population bomb on anialape. Doesn’t sound fun to go against.
Here’s a fun thought:  Spicy Extract + Foul Play
I feel like there's something you could do with spicy extract and defiant kingambit or something with mirror herb
Wolfeyyy you should really slow down and do more research before running into producing videos! All your little mistakes add up and just create more work for yourself. :(
A team without revival blessing is at a disadvantage to one with poor competitive
Meanwhile Annihilape:  *_dies to lower a tatsugiri's health_*
a scope lens increases the accuracy of pop bomb to 99% which is REALLY nice
Revival blessing+leppa berry allows you to use the move twice
I unsubbed after hearing you pronouce glaive rush
This video feel like wolfeyvgc making a video realizing that he make some mistakes and he call in bonuswolfe for help
1.Use double shock 2.turn to the electric terastal 3.repeat
Wolfey, double shock can be used consecutively if you are terrastalized to the electric type. The game's text says that you have used up your energy, but you still remain electric type... Don't know if it makes it better or if you already knew this but Ithought it was a fun little nugget of info.
It seems that you missed mortal spin also clears hazards like rapid spin does.
Scovillain's move might actually be cracked if your partner pokemon is defiant or has an ability that boosts a stat when one is lowered
For Comeuppance, you mentioned Reflect and Mirror Coat. I hope you meant Counter and Mirror Coat.   PS, my oldest nephew is a fan of yours. I'm teaching him competitive Pokémon.
I think he might be wrong about twin beam...isn't it 80 bp not 40 since it attacks twice and it breaks focus stash and things like that almost like dual wing beat?
so doodle may be dependent on what the opponent has, but what about if you pair it with a mon with an ability you want to lose. such as . . . i don't know, truant or klutz.
No, not the Dynamax lucario all over again.
I’ve been a one trick pony my whole play through. Swords Dance-Bitter Blade lol
What about flip turn and the torque moves
Wolfey spidops has a base speed of 35 one even two speed drops won't do anything
Spicy Extract actually raises the TARGETS attack, it’s more like swagger than D Dance nvm i unpaused
1:52 this move is glicked more like wolfe glick
Twin beam breaks sash soooo.
I wish you rated the moves consistently and alone while maybe mentioning the mon it’s on, not sometimes based on the mon it’s currently on Plus all the times you said abilities instead of moves lmao Also it’s said “Glaive” guh lay ve, it’s a weapon, not glee ave
So as a reminder to everyone Wolfy plays VGC not Singles so some of the effectiveness of the moves might be different
U mixed un scovillians move
He said pounce was new…. But I remember using it on pheramosa in USUM
I think quaquaval can be great on rain teams with swift swim as a hidden ability and pair it with kilowattrel and tailwind I think you can sweep some teams
I always wondered, what's your favorite pokemon?
Gay plant is online
Collision Course and Electro Drift get a bonus of ~33% damage when super effective, not including the Super effective x2 damage or their abilities. Therefore, a super effective Collision Course and Electro Drift, with their 100 BP, have a total BP of ~266. This does not include their ability boosts.
Hey Wolfey - just wanted to let you know, if Pawmot electric type terastalizes, double shock can be used indefinitely
anyone know the soundtrack that starts playing in the background at 8:22
Question what if u give it the loaded dice
I think She’d Tail hasn’t been explored enough
Make anihallape Tera fighting and hit it with mausholds population bomb, instant 550 Bp move
Mr. Wolf, I'm really loving the content and currently have been enjoying the heck out of SV. I think I finally want to make a break into VGC but I don't know if I should start playing on showdown, ladder, or in real tourneys yet
Scovaillan’s could’ve been so good if it didn’t make you a OHKO 😭
8:12 SPINJITSU
I've been playing around with an annihilape with punching glove, drain punch and rage fist. It's fun to use drain punch to keep yourself alive while taking a beating, just to dish it all back out once to take enough hits  With two of the elemental punches as coverage I guess.
I didn’t know the negative effects of Glaive Rush could be bypassed by protect next turn, I thought that even if you protected the negative effects would carry over to future turns until Baxcalibur was attacked
Twin Beam is F-tier? But it's psychic that breaks focus sash/sturdy
LMAO went to subscribe but already subscribed
The problem with Silk Trap is that Spidops is itself a very slow pokemon so if you were ever going to run it, it would be in a trick room team. But lowering your opponents speed, as a trick room team, is obviously bad. On paper Silk trap is a very nice move but it does not work for spidops, if a faster bug type mon had it then it would be cool
Imo, Last Respects would thematically be good on Marshadow but balance-wise.. idk
I mean, I think doodle is s tier. Slaking. Been swept multiple times to life orb or leftover slaking on Pokémon showdown
double shock really shines with tera type electric, you get to keep your electric typing
but mortal spin doesnt just remove leech seed n stuff it also removes hazards just like rapid spin does
I know this is about moves but I loved the camera on PLA but the scenes in the background were wayyy too static. This Gen the camera is poo but I love the action I. The background
How does Spicy Extract interact with mons with things such as Clear Body or a white herb? Couldn't you just give your other mon a free Swords Dance while allowing it to move in that turn?
Something I noticed: Order Up can still be used if there isn't a Tatsugiri inside Dondozo's mouth, however it won't give any stat boosts.   Another fun fact is that you might have noticed the animation for Order Up changes to show what kind to Tatsugiri is in Dondozo's mouth, but if you don't have one in its mouth, then the move just shows three Tatsu sushi blocks (what Tatsugiri is based on) in the three colors of Tatsugiri (Red, Orange and Yellow.)
What happens if you use double shock then tera into electric type, can you use it again?
I never knew chilly reception existed until this video. Neat.
Mortal spin is amaaaazing in singles though It is a better rapid spin
Doesn’t Revavroom? (Think that’s how you spell it) have 5 other moves that relate to the 5 team star Star-mobile? (Someone correct my misspelling)
Man if Orthworm had more going for it, Tera electric would be really solid on it defensively
spicy extract can be useful somehow to allies especially those with defiant
I cannot be more terrified of Population Bomb 😭
With Population Bomb, what makes it even more broken is King’s Rock.
MORTAL SPIN IS CRACKED  IT IS RAPID SPIN BUT IT POISONS
Wolfey vid pog that’s a nice day now
Hey Wolfy, Annihilape and Maushold would be broken wouldn't they? Population Bomb friendly fire plus Rage Fist on a normal type resisted Tera type on Annihilape.
when will we see a wolfey wideo getting dudududunsparce to rank 1?
I've just realized that wolfey is putting out this many videos not only because of the new generation but because it's also Christmas so he gets paid waay more. Nice business idea, I couldn't be happier, I get more videos, which are looking great so far, and the wolf gets richer so maybe in the future we get even more videos. I just hope he doesn't burn out so I'm hoping he takes some vacation soon. Keep it up man you are doing great! PS: congrats to the editors for such fantastic work too
I’ve been trying as hard as I can to finish this game quickly so I can watch all of these videos spoiler free but I keep getting distracted with random side activities within the game and it’s upsetting
Should have called Chilly Reception "Cold Call"
POPULATION BOMB the Annihilape with the Maushold ability being Friend Guard.
Acr: Flower Trick also never misses. S+ IMO
oof I stopped watching on the pronunciation of glaive x.x that's so bad to my ears, sorry boss.
This whole video is a very effective anti-Smeargle campaign
actually, order up gains stab after dondozo eat tatsugiri
Someone may have rushed the first record of this video, so many “ok, so actually…” inserts 😅
I think Silk Trap needs dropped a tier simply because Spidops base speed is a garbage 35, so chances are he will STILL be slower than the opponent after it activating, and he is the only one who can learn it. So its garbage.  On the flip flop, Doodle deserves an A-tier slot. :) I've already done some disgusting plays with it
22:23 Gay Plant TM playing pokemon violet
Rage Fist actually has an upper limit, someone made a video about it. IIRC, it's around 300.
imagine using spicy extract in duos when you have a contrary pokemon as your partner.
Imagine Kings rock on that 10hit move...
holy fucking alogirthm hit
Comment for the algorithm
Revival Blessing With Leppa Berry? ;D
You said  that Population Bomb was the first attack that can hit more than 5 times...  Beat Up with a full party is 6 hits.
I can't help but feel like the animation for Glaive Rush is riffing on the Godzilla meme that has Godzilla rushing forward on his tail...
The niche of Spicy Extract imo is that under the right conditions it can be an ally-Swords Dance since it can target allies, but you’d have to rely on either outspeeding the opponents or the opponent having special attackers.
Spicy extract taegeting your own defiant pokemon????
18:39 I see what you did there
Let’s be honest Wolfey is hella cute lol 🙄
I assume if they’re gonna balance it, they have to make it not work with leppa berries or make it have a middling success rate, as if it doesn’t have either it’s gonna be broken in competitively.
why do some of the moves say 101% accuracy?
I think aqua cutter samurot with focus energy would be a really fun thing to use. Maybe not viable, but fun
I'm interested in whether Double Shock/Terastilize combos become viable.
What happens if pawmot uses double shock when terrastalized with an electric terra type? Can you just spam it? I imagine it would just take the base type away and not the terra type, but idk
Wolfey try not to mess up script (99% fail)
Love the conquest music
I think you forgot Tidy Up
Really enjoyed learning all the new info from your videos on scarlet & violet! Appreciate the content keep it up!
this might be petty but I just wish they called Double Shock something different, because how do you see that name and not think "oh cool, is it gonna be like an electric type bonemerang or double iron bash? that'd be INSANE" and then it doesn't multi-hit and its name really doesn't clue you into what it REALLY does
Definitely gonna be concerned about revival blessing and maybe gigaton hammer and probably galaive rush
The pronunciation of glaive had me reeling.
Fillet away is half health not 25% I believe
im not gonna lie... i was very surprised with the amount of mistakes in this video, im sure wolfey would agree
Population bomb + King's rock
Imagine an Impish Eviolite-holding Anger Point Primeape getting hit by a low ATK-stat Maushold 10 times before Rage Fisting with a 550 BP move from a Pokemon with 105 ATK. And, if any of those Maushold hits crit, Primeape gets +1 to its ATK for each Crit. Or, in other words... Say hello to your new god of war. The only thing that can stop you is a Normal type... Which you'll obviously have Fighting moves to use against them and Dark moves against any Psychic that wishes to go after you for being Fighting-type. And, of course, this assumes Eviolite is the best option here. Maybe Primeape would be better served with Leftovers or some other regenerative item? It's definitely good for a gimmick team at the very least.
Someone tested rage fist with Population Bomb in Doubles.   I believe the ceiling is 6 hits. One more than Last Respects.
So I wanna say something I found for double shock. If you use it the terastalize to electric, you can use it again
6:37 beat up can technically hit 6times
If tinkaton had an actual attack stat combining its gigaton hammer with dudunsparce using hyper drill would be insane
I guess Jolteon with pin missile hitting your team's Annihilape will definitely get your enemies destroyed..
oi!!!!! beat up could always hit 6 times >:(
For Revival Blessing, you can theoretically use it twice with a leppa berry assuming that works
Scyther was confused because why you would use a Fighting type move on a Bug/Flying Type
Doodle seems best for getting rid of bad abilities like Truant. So in the right teams it is essential, but otherwise just for edge cases.
I am completely horrified of the mouse
Umm wolf, spicy extract sharply lowers opponents defense, and sharply boosts THEIR attack not yours
Cant believe that he mentioned Ice Spinner and didn’t notice that it is broken against Miraidon
Rage Fist maxes at 350 base power. Still what I'm most afraid of.
#19 on trending. That’s deserved by Wolfeys high quality content.
The legendary’s in scarlet and violet are so similar they do the exact same thing
21:10 what if you use population bomb on him and then use the move?
Also, if you put King’s rock on Maushold, it can nearly guarantee a flinch, which is frightening.
Wolfey I think you might need to relook at double shock 👀 turns out if you terastalize Pawmot into a pure electric type it's able to use it more than once! It's absolutely busted!
Testing on rage fist has determined it caps at 6 hits
Tera blast also uses the higher of your atk or special
Pair Annihilape with a pokemon that can hit it with multi-hitting moves. Hit your own Annihilape, Rage Fist goes sicko mode. If Annihilape dies, use Revival Blessing. If it doesn't, use Drain Punch.
I don’t get the balancing with mewoscarda’s unique attack. It can’t miss and always crits to do 105 base power every time (20+ more than the other starters and can’t miss)
Paradox pokemon tier-list?
Imagine your in a match and they use population bomb on their own annihilape that is terrifying
Doodle is better than you're giving it credit for. Double intimidate, "Ruin" Ability, Unaware, Regenerator, Earth Eater, Thermal exchange. More than anything SV added broken abilities. It also gives slaking a chance to be meta
Varoom’s signature move could be really good in trick room teams
4:18 correction the move still works it just doesnt give u a boost
Imagine population bomb + accuracy + kings rock Pretty much 100% flinch lol
How much did you rush this video? You missed a few moves and you made several errors when describing them. Spicy extract increases the attack and lowers the defense of the same target but you said it raises the attack of the user and lowers the defense of the opponent.
Salt cure should be put higher for this reason. It can completely wall the dodonzo strat that Wolfey used to get rank 1 with. Cause after you inflict it, the opposing player has no choice but to stop the setup and restart it. Which will probably lose them the game. 1 move can totally nullify the most broken strat currently
I put Tera Blast on my Persian it already has the Stab Normal and I also have a cover for fighting with the terastalization tera blast
22:23 👀 kappa
Leppa Berry Revival Blessing is the single scariest thing ever added to Pokemon.
Isn't wave crash from this gen as well
Did you just use your own name as a euphemism for missing @ 1:52 ? LMAO
9:45 welp i met a guy in VGC he used a leppa berry revival blessing pawmot, which he has uhhh revived his back bone to 100% health. menacing
16:50 hold up Wolfey that does not triple in power. It gets a 30% boost. Big difference
Champ should have led with glim ran that revive move so she could still close with her ace that way the fight would actually be kinda fun and would have been crazy unique to see a champ pull the revive card on you for a change
Mortal Spin is not as bad imo. It’s a poison type rapid spin that can poison, but has half the power
One of the best parts of scarlet and violet, is the endless stream of content it's allowed Wolfey to deliver to us. Keep up the awesome work! 👏
Uh... Mortal SPin works exactly like Rapid Spin. That's not fantastic for VGC, but it's REALLY good in singles.
Revival Blessing bout to SAVE some Nuzlocks
shout out to gay plant
Salt cure is so fking busted for double battle stalling, plus garganacl is just different.
Rage fist obliterates Tera raids LMAO
1:06 Mortal Spin actually also removes Entry Hazards, making it pretty good (perhaps more important in singles though)  Also, Double Shock cannot remove the users Tera Electric Type, allowing it to be spammed
Congrats of trending, Wolfey!🥳 You totally deserve it!
another thing u can do with double shock is tera into an electric type after u lose ur electric typing, and then u can use the move again
i think that raging bull can be sorta meta, because it does neutral damage to Grimmsnarl (if i can recall) and it can break it's reflect screens and stuff. if it gets walled by it then it can tera into steel and probably hit it with a stab iron head or something edit: on another note, it can get intimidate which can be crucial for dealing with that hairy loser 2nd edit: after looking into it a little, i recognized that fire tauros takes neutral damage from fairy, so i think you should actually run something like fighting tera type (i dont know how to use the showdown calculator so if you know if it kills please lmk). if you have a water one you should probably just run steel tera type lol
Silk trap is just plainly but king's shield but it lowers your speed and scovillain would be a very good support pokemon for dragon types
Rage fist caps at 350 BP
Idk if its bugged or working properly on showdown, but if you Terra electric pawmaw, you get to keep using double shock. I assume this works with burn out as well but idk. Hits really hard with the double Terra dipping and you can just spam it
12:00 --  Doodle  Think about it the other way.  Are there any Pokemon with really bad abilities holding them back, like say...  Slaking, Regigigas...  that you can park a Grafaiai next to and use Doodle to copy literally anything over their abilities?
In regards to Baxcalibur’s move, it would have to be the slowest thing around in order to not take double damage from the next attack, since the downside activates in the same turn  Edit: Seems I misunderstood the wording of the move. Carry on gents
Just gonna say youve been putting in crazy work to get videos out. Great content man
Beat up can hit 6 times.
*Fuck it we* Gigaton Hammer
Can someone give me the discord link please
at 22:22 Gay Plant gets online
Surely he knows that you can in fact use Order Up even if theres not a Tatsugiri out? It just doesn't boost any stat.
great vid
i can already smell the defian ape with bulldoze partner trick room
note on Double Shock: if you electric terrastalize your pawmot, you can use it as many times as you want
Please go over Double Shock and Burn up again because if you terra then you keep the typing and can do it over again. Yes it is a niche but more information the better
"This is the first move to hit more than 5 times" beat up that hits 6 times
Correction, Houndstone learns Last Respects not Greavard
I still don't get why people don't understand the Spicy Extract description. It clearly says that it's only affecting the opponent with the stat changes, not the user itself.
Gleeave Rush
Real question, lets say i run endure on anhilape...even tho no damage was done, will the base power of rage fist increase?
love the gaa music
imagine if they add a pokemon who has harvest, and has a leppa berry, who knows revivial blessing
glee-ayve rush
wave crash
1:05 101% accurate lol
Would the meta be filled with Revival Blessing, Encore would be so good right?
"glee-ave rush" ?????
How does double shock (or burn up) interact with terastalize?
You are soo off for mostly atacks jez......
5:40 the way the description for "Spicy Extract" is written makes everyone think that. I thought that at first. Papasea and Antlerboy also made that mistake. It's a shame that attack doesn't work how it should, it would be a great setup move for forcing walls out.
Population bomb maushold + ring target annihillape = loads of boosts for annihillape's rage fist. The ring target is so population bomb can hit. If the ring target let's your enemy hit you, just have it use fling, which annihillape can learn.
Move that has any type and can use either the Attack OR the asp. Attack stat
Imagine clicking glaive rush and they switch in dudunsparse lmao
don*dozo
Correction for population bomb. There is another move that can move than 5 times. That being beat up can hit 6.
“Glee-ave” rush is gonna take me out
With regards to pounce, my technician SD Scizor would like a word with you. /LH
This man out here disrespecting mortal spin just because his format isnt riddled with entry hazards.
Basically Spicy Extract is just a worse version of Screech where it helps out the target too, maybe you could use it on an ally to ensure they deal a lot of damage next turn but it seems very situational (like if the ally has a Clear Amulet or something.)
If terastalized into electric type, double shock can be used multiple time. Haven't tested burnup yet, but i guess it will work the same too.
I want the video of the clutch 2nd round of the final game yesterday, (not the for the glory one)  That was definitely a world champ difference
Can't you use a Leppa Berry with Revival Blessing... 2 FREE REVIVES!!
Your friend gay plant wants to play😂
Trickroom Reveroom sounds very good with spin out.
Pretty sure Rage Fist has a cap of about 5 or 6 boosts, which is still bonkers but not uncapped bonkers
Picture this duo. Prankster Grafaiai with Doodle + Slaking.
Wolfey forgot that sleep talk doesnt take PP away from revival blessing and can thus be used 16 times
Throat spray Skeledirge was completely OP  for me during my playthrough
Addition to double shock: pawmot can't lose its electric typing when terrastralized
4:59 it boosts the target's attack no?
Last respects is probably just ok in doubles, but in singles it trivializes the game.
I put Wolfey in the GOAT tier
I used a Skeledirge and I am pretty sure Torch Song is only 70 base power
Annihilape "first human" is my fave Mon of this gen
I came up with a Maushold+Annihilape strat on the first days and I´ve been auto beating up or Population bomb my Annihilape and it can nuke nearly everything, the only thing is that I think there´s a cap at 6 or 7 hits. I been hitting dondozo for 85% dmg with ragefist, regardless of my Pop Bomb hitting 7 or 10 times. I don´t know if it caps at 300,350 or 400, but for sure when I hit my own tera steel annihilape with Pop Bomb 10 times it does not reach 550 power, nor it keeps going up per hit.  Great job on this one Wolfe!
Hope wolfey does a part 2 with corrections because boy he forgot a few things
"Glee-ave" kekekeke
fillet away takes away 50 percent health not 25
Never misses is different to 100%accuracy
thanks wolfe for the awesome video!!!! super enlgihting for my o wn  pokemon battles!!!
Maushold using population bomb on a steel terastilized annihilape might have potential
Umm... Where's Tidy Up???
I knew the moment I saw Palafin and Moushold on the Datadex that they had gimmick and op potential. I consider myself good at identifying strats, but absolutely p*ss as actually playing comp. Ask me questions.
Does anybody know if Hyper Drill (or Feint) break through endure?
you could use doodle with your partner archeops to get rid of defeatist
Spicy extract could be good fighting a special attacker
Rage fist sadly does in fact have an upper limit of 350.
You can use double shock multiple times if you terastalize into the electric type because it will never remove your typing.
Where new Pokémon video? But good job though, I only just subscribed and am loving your videos so far.
Flower trick also never misses (Exeption for moves like dive, dig, fly etc)   Edit:I dunno if you mentioned it
New drinking game.. take a shot everytime Wolfey called a move an ability 🥴🍻🍻🍻
Think the meta strat to break Rage Fist is to have a partner Jolteon use Pin Missile on you. Fast, not STAB, coming off a weaker attack stat, Annihilape quad resists it, and with loaded dice it has a better chance of getting the full 5 hits.   All of this means Annihilape won’t particularly care about getting hit, but decide it’s going to be the opponent’s problem anyway.
Don't worry Wolfe, I also read spicy extract wrong. I thought it was busted but was going to be a unique move forever sort of deal. As it is they could give it to most pokemon and it wouldn't be used lol
nah spicy extract bois, combo with defiant
Doesnt Shadow Force and Phatom Force hit through protect and detect?
Double Shock is actually extremely broken when Terastalized to Electric Type, because the Tera Type cannot be changed or removed by any effect, meaning Pawmot can deal 240 power consecutively, and retain its typing.
Fun Fact: You can pair Revival Blessing with Leppa Berry for double res.
1:03 101% accuracy? wtf?
Dude the blessing move is so strong
Counter
What if we Tera Annihilape into Fighting and hit it with a weakened population bomb? 😈
6:36 Small correction, Beat Up is the first move that can hit more than 5 times, being able to hit 6 times in a single turn, but i get what you mean
Wolfey: Multiple time tournament champion, certified Pokémon Master Also Wolfey: Calling moves 'abilities'
Infiltrator on Shed Tail: I'm gonna end this man whole carrer. Sure,  it's niche, but hey, that ought to hurt.
@8:56 Gliave Rush??? World champ diff I guess
Rage fist scary
S rank for the name of kingambit’s attack.also pounce and trailblaze is really good on scizor
Just had a flash of inspiration and had to hop onto Showdown to test it. It seems Clear Body and the Clear Amulet both block the defense drop from your teammate's Spicy Extract. Was able to effectively Swords Dance a Choice Band Garganacl and had Ceruledge snowballing hard.
Wolfe u forgot to mention Leppa berry. leppa berry allows u to do 2 revival blessings
It would be so helpful to see you making random pokemon teams ready for competitive so we can learn the logic behind move sets, items and combos
6:34 Beat up be like: Oh hell naw, man!
You should change the title to include that your analysis ignores single battles for some of these moves. Mortal spin sounds like a fantastic move against grass stall
Gay plant
Make it Rain isn't as powerful because it counter easily.
🤔 will you do the new pokemon?  Don't understand how revival blessing is OP as you only use it once but they would be half hp
Rage fist DOES have a cap. It caps out at 350 BP, or after 6 hits
Pawmis signature move can be used indefinitely if you terastilize tho.
doodle slacking 💀
4:55 Scovillain's move Spicy Extract is not D tier that's doing it complete injustice, it's niche but potentially B tier. IMO it's a far superior move combining Swagger + Screech - confusion. I'm setting you up for a faster teamate or priority move to pick off your now absymal defense. An excellenct example would be Armorogue, high special attack and physical defense, Spicy Exctract invalidates them by giving a useless buff and crippling their physical wall. Similar Special offense, high defense pokemon are crippled too.
21:18 this move would be crazy in doubles if you could hit it with population bomb
Silk trap 101 accuracy
Doubles Spicy Extract with physical Espathra??
Axe kick does half hp in recoil
I’m planning a team that revolves around Revival Blessing with a Leppa berry. I’m sorry but I think it’ll be fun to use lol
i love wolfey from the future ahahha
Past Wolfe is not that good. Future Wolfe is waaay better, thats what happens when you have the World Champ Difference Baby.
I mean Spicy Extract is not that bad. It's great using it against Special Attackers, sort of like Swagger, and Clear Amulet / Clear Body can negate the Defence drop, making it great in Tag Team VGC.
6:58  Population Bomb is extremely strong. Unlike a lot of other multi hit moves, it will always hit 10 times, unless it misses a hit. But it has a separate Accuracy check each time. That means that you have about a 35% chance to hit 10 times, or about 90% with Scope Lens. If you want to be annoying, you can even give it a King’s Rock for about a 65% chance for the opponent to flinch. And Maushold even has Technician, meaning each of the hits essentially have a 30BP. Ignoring other potential boosts like STAB, Tera STAB, Choice Band, or Life Orb.  Obviously it has it’s counters (mainly Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, and Ghost types), but I think it’s definitely S tier.   On a side note, how did they make a Water type Punch move before a Grass type one? The pun name is already there, they can call it Tropical Punch (or Fruit Punch).
6:56 Feel free to check my math (not my best work), but I think the average # of hits for Population Bomb is 5.862 with a standard deviation of .898. So 95% of attacks should hit between 4.07 and 7.66 times. This doesn't reflect the probability completely accurately though as 10 hits should occur about 34.9% of the time. The probability is not actually approximated by the binomial distribution due to this. If we take the condition that the number of hits is less than 10, the conditional expected value becomes 3.647. So in short the move is pretty good because the risk is low and reward is high. But the risk averse will still realize that 10% of the time you'll get 0 damage off and might prefer a 100% accurate move.
Imagine Gigaton Hammer on Zacian tho
Bitter blade sweaped so many trainers using sword dance then 1 hitting everything with bitter blade and if I get outsped I just heal to full
Are you sure Order Up fails when Dondozo doesn't have a Tatsugiri? The description says it only gets the stat boost when it has Tatsugiri but doesn't say it fails otherwise.
I always love these style of Wolfey videos, but they were a lot more corrections needed than usual and some moves like Order Up and Fillet Away weren’t corrected.
Why don't you just cut out the parts where you sad something wrong and just record it again and put it in?
if you terra u can x2shock more than once per switch in
Doesn’t Giratinas signature move also go through protect?
Man really said reflect instead of counter
23:30  Comeuppance is not like Reflect, more like Retaliate/Counter or Mirror Coat 🤔
Safe to say these are the most powerful moves we’ve ever gotten in a single generation. Usually we get a few but got many this time around.
I like running torch song with throat spray
my boy mixed up reflect and counter
great video, just wish you added the pokemon pictures when you talked about exclusive moves. Would make it easier to follow.
If tatsu dies in the mouth he still retains the order up buff
I know it wasn't that good, but I did try to utilize Steel Roller on a Trick Room Terrain team using Stakataka as my Trick Room Steel Roller, with Indeedee as a Heal Pulse, Follow Me Terrain setter, Rillaboom as another Terrain Setter with a overall good movepool, and Tapu Lele as the last Terrain user, and being able to switch out and always have a terrain up, and a support mon to keep the board up and just Steel Roller every turn with Stak...again, wasn't great, but it had a good amount of wins and was very fun
take a shot every time he says signature ability instead of signature move
Gay plant is playing Pokemon Violet
Nice to see you are truly LGBT friendly XD <3 22:23
Trick Room + Spin out
Doodle and slacking is fun
Rage Fist is the main reason I lose Annihilape Raids, seriously need to train up a good Normal type for it lol. Maybe Oranguru or Indeedee.
Slaking with doodle be like
Ngl I hope revival blessing gets banned, it just seems goofy and cheap to me.
Gen 9: if i got a nickel every time i had a ghost move with 50 base power that seem bad but increase by 50 many times and become broken, i’d have two nickels. Which isn’t much, but it’s weird that it happened twice
shoutout to Gay Plant™ @ 22:22
Imagine Torch Song on something like Chi-Yu lol.
6:35 this is if you don't count beat up in 6v6
gigaton hammer is my favorite move. there's something amusing about my little pink goblin smashing shit with a massive hammer
it would be cool to see the actual tier list at the end of the vid just as a recap :)
Is it possible to use PP up on Revial Blessing?
I caught a shiny dunsparce day one, and man i hope dudunsparce becomes viable with hyper drill
Mortal spin removes hazards
I for one am a grafaiai believer. Doodle and ability shield op. Prankster doodle a slacking. It will be beyond broken if they add regichad.
5:45 😂
Doodle could give Slaking a good ability. So there’s some utility there
Spicy extract is not that bad, use it on  a special attacker or even on a teammate in some cases and it’s deadly
King dudunsparce getting an s+
I think spin out on Varoom and Revaroom has some really neat utility with the speed drop. It can directly improve Gyro ball on the same set, on Pokemon that are already kinda slow. The little bit of testing i’ve done with Varoom on Little Cup has me excited for it.
Bro Glaive is just a regular ass word how do you mess it up?
Wolfey ily but you really gotta review these scripts. Ik it’s nitpicky and kind of annoying for me to say this but the amount of times you said ability instead of move, and reflect instead of counter, and the amount of correction edits all start to add up. Great video and I’m looking forward to the next ones, but I just wanted to give this critique
Doodle with wonder guard
2:13 just get a pokemon with rock head ability and doesnt take recoil or get one with rock head and use entrainment on the mon you want it on
Where Wave Crash?
Slight correction with Rage Fist, there is an upper limit, but the upper limit is 350 BASE POWER. Also Last Respects also has a upper limit but its 5050 Base Power and that's extremely unlikely to be hit even in casual play and in comp singles the max is 7 (with 2 revival blessings) and in doubles its 5. Tho unlike rage fist its extremely hard to reach this while with Rage fist you can just be hit by an ally mon's weak multi hit move 2-5 times turn 1 and even if you are killed you can just revival blessing and get a 200-350 BP move
DONT know if you ready these but - you do a lot of good context about ALL the new stuff. You could re upload shorter (more relevant) versions of them. Like the best new moves, the best new abilities so on.
A bit niche, but I imagine Scovillains signature move pairs well with Foul Play. Raising the targets attack to have the move deal more while also lowering their defense to help that. Otherwise yeah pretty garbage move if you plan on using it on a teammate it's essentially worse Decorate (Alcremie's move)
Some fun tech i just thought of is because annihalape is quadruple resistant to bug you can switch it in on a predicted u-turn for a rage fist boost or, if you wanna go all in, have your partner attack annihalape with u-turn as it sets up using bulk up or something like that
Bruh they made revival blessing the meta knight of Pokémon moves
Doodle is gonna slap when the ruin legends are out. Make your team immune to a relevant stat decrease while potentially setting up and keeping those stat decreasing abilities for a sweep. I can see it happening.
Order Up works without Tatsugiri
Maushold + Technician + Population Bomb + Silk Scarf, Wide Lens, or Loaded Dice + Tera Normal = God, help us all.
would love a video like this for all new abilities!
Meanwhile Houndstone is UBER at smogon, and is gonna be OU most probably in doubles. Aaaand this is why even "champion difference" vgc players don't know the game as much as smogon analysts.
This video could have benefitted from a better structure, I feel. Lead with all the generic moves first, then follow up with the signatures.
Doodle ist basically  ditto in ubers but worse. Because you have to be scarf like ditto in order to do prankster shenanigans. I just played the story with 3 mons so idk what ability  it has
10:09 really messed me up lol, "one of my favourite pokemon, salt cure". I was like did I hear that right lool Jokes aside, such a great video. Great way to learn about all the new moves!
22:22 Gay Plant
It's sad that Rage Fist maxes out at 350 base power, but that's still a ridiculous move
Honestly I think the S on Electro Drift kinda bad. Collision Course Super Effectives on a lot of different types, including commonly-seen types that are generally bulky and hard to get over anyhow, as well as countering NormalNite. Electro Drift is chasing Super Effective against two types, one of which is already commonly checked by Stealth Cocks and is just a poor defensive type in general. Flying is likely to be T-Typed away from anyhow, while a water may be kept for decent defensive utility. But I think the difference in type bumps it down to A (Maybe A+ because it's the top of A)
If you use spicy extract and your partner has foul play it can be really good and foul play is a common move still in this format, I wouldn't put it at "D" lol, because your giving foul play a 4x boost, raising your opponents attack by 2 stages and lowering its defense by 2, foul play is a physical move as well.
i never knew crits ignore stat changes, that woulda been a game changer while playing through the main story lol
Where’s tidy up?
Some extra notes to add about Mortal Spin. Getting the Rapid Spin effect is an okay bonus but it's secretly also a spread move and for some reason doesn't make contact. Previously this role of poisoning both foes was possible with poison gas, but that had 90% accuracy, or with 0.25% of sludge waves. Glimmora adds Toxic Spikes to spread more poison without having to use a second move or Corrosion to poison poison-types.  So... This move probably still isn't great and Glimmora might not have the best stat-spread or typing to use it. But I think there could be potential.
spicy extract with white herb unburden hawlucha with swords dance could be good
Doodle a huge Power Azumaril onto your Slaking
If only baxcalibur could have got ice spinner
Can't beat up hit 6 times, or am u tripping?
I despise revival blessing. In a competitive fight, if I kill an opponent, they should remain dead.
isnt beat up technically the first move that could hit more than 5 times?
Bitter blade with life orb is OP.
Your live reaction to Gigaton hammer is hilarious
22:26 top left corner lol
I feel like tera blast should be ranked higher because OF how flexible it is, the coverage this move can have and 80 base power + stab because it forms to your tera type and it will come from which ever stat is higher attack or special attack.
More errors than usual, but still a fun vid Salt Cure deserves a higher rating cuz it's a damaging move that applies a dot effect that is pretty significant, and counters pokemon with otherwise strong defensive typing. A neat property of the move is that since it is a debuff applied to the enemy mon, it persists even if Garganacl switches out. The lower instantaneous power is what led to Wolfe rating it lower in the VGC format, where each turn is very valuable, but I've seen Garganacl stall in action and it's something to respect. Garganacl has the bulk to warrant the use of this move, and becomes especially good if you give it a defensive typing such as tera Ghost. Purifying Salt Garganacl with Tera Ghost, Salt Cure, Recover, and other moves like Wide Guard, Protect, Bulldoze, Brick Break, or even a Iron Defense/Body Press setup make it a pretty good mon. Purifying Salt might work with Rest as well to prevent the sleep status, leading to Rest simply being a better Recover, but someone would have to check that. Explosion with Garganacl's respectable 100 base attack also seems like a funny surprise option.  Btw, does Taunt count as a status condition Purifying Salt would block? If not, and Gargancl can be taunted, that would make the mon a good bit worse, although still decent
Flying Tera Gyarados with Tera blast actually has a “physical” flying type move now. That by itself makes me love it.
I love the Pokemon Conquest theme Wolfey and co used. Iove that game for like no reason and I've played it so much that I'm pretty sure the theme they use is the steel type castle theme.
You didn't even mention the bonus cash from Make it Rain!!! Bonus tournament prize earnings is the most overpowered effect of them all
21:31 you can mix rage first with population bomb. Use population bomb on you Pokémon that knows rage fist, if it hits 10 times then rage fist has 550 power. It is basically a one hit KO
101% accurate 👌
“Population bomb is the first move to hit more than 5 times” Idk if anyone’s pointed this out, but Beat Up hits 6 times with a full party I guess this doesn’t apply in VGC, but it still counts as a move that hits >5 times
21:19 nope there is a limit it can be buffed by 50 for 6 times so up to 350 basepower
If Beat Up is a move in S/V, then Anhilape will be insane
lowkey, i wanna make tera blast work on Pixelate Sylveon
Rage fist does have an upper limit, Foo did a test
Glee-ave rush? It’s pronounced glay-ve rush unless I’m missing something
One thing I love about Pokemon is that so many of the low tier moves, like the terrestrialization and salt cure, have a ton of potential as super powerful niche uses. Stuff like that has the potential to be (sorta) pachirisu's level of unexpected meta impact. Just weird one-off teams that dominate the meta out of nowhere and bring unexpected big wins
The problem with doodle is that you can't copy quirk drive or protosynth, disguise, ice face, etc... :<
I love this man. The purest pokésoul ever that is my main source of information in trying to play competitive Pokémon
23:27  "Reflect and Mirror Coat."  I think you mean Counter and Mirror Coat.  "WAAAAAABUUUFEEETTTTTTT~~~!!!"  Snack time is later, get back in your ball.
What if you did Revival Blessing with Leppa Berry? Couldn't you use it twice then?
23:03 I would like to add the note that if you are terastilised, this doesn't remove the electric type, so I think it's good in that situation
Was about to correct a couple before wolfy of the future did lmao. Still gonna correct one though. You said reflect and mirror coat instead of counter and mirror coat
Something about revival blessing is that with a leppa barry it has 2 pp.
Winton overwat
Why include the incorrect info about Scoville's move? Just cut it lmao
All i’ve been doing is tera fairy bulk up rage fist annihilape to sweep noobs as a noob myself. Pretty fun till I get a pretty skilled player
11:59 bro, let me help you. Slaking, removes truant. you are welcome
Only Wolfey could pronounce glaive (glay-ve) as glee-ay-ve
Someone please help me learn how to get a population bomb + rage fist set up going
8:56 I do not think is is legitimately possible to see “glaive” and pronounce it as “gliave”
If Pawmot uses Double Shock and then electric Terrastallizes, it'll get electric type back, right? Which will also allow it to double shock again? Not saying this will necessarily be the Pawmot meta, but it's an interesting concept that adds some utility to the move.
While i appreciate and am thankful for the corrections added to the video, the amount of them, combined with the extra corrections that can be found in the comment section, i think this video was simply recorded too early either when not enough information about these moves was available or before Wolfey had played the game enough to be familiar with a lot of these moves and how they function in practice.
Make it rain is pretty horrifying to be honest.  I think we're going to be seeing A LOT of Gholdengo in VGC.
Nah bro salt cure is amazing for pokemon that are setting up
Order Up can still be used even if Tatsugiri isn't on the field. I used Dondozo on my main story team, and Order Up was very helpful
Imagine if annhialape wasn't a ghost type and he got hit by population bomb and survive
spicy extract is good because its so versatile, you can use it on special attack opponents with mirror herb, or use it directly before an ally so they get a quick swords dance
Chilling Reception is a nod to the second movie.
Population Bomb is a mix between a 55 BP 75% AC move and a 130 BP 50% AC move.
Scarlet & Violet bring you so many content and I'm love it
Man this video is riddled with mistakes and omissions :(
Okay but Spicy extract on a defiant mon
So with Double Shock can you terrastallize to get Electric type back and use it again?
This got me considering Houndstone with Last Respects, TTar for Sand to enable Sand Rush, a Rabsca with Revival Blessing and a Pawmot also with Revival Blessing, the last two holding Leppa Berry.  The plan is simple. Just die and come back to max out Last Respects.
Rage fist has a limit of 6 hits for 350 base power.
Wolfe, you way want to reupload with all the info that views have left in the comments included, also you say signature ability instead of move a lot so this video is really lacking polish, i get that you are very busy right now, understandably, but a simple reshoot shouldnt take too long for this video.   Keep up the content though, really enjoying it :)
gallade getting sharpness is crazy because it makes sacred sword stronger than CC by 15 base damage, while ignoring def boosts, wo any drawback, sharpness is actually nutty for gallade, also missed opportunity for giving armorouge and ceruledge, mega launcher an sharpness respectively
Double hit moves kill sturdy and focus sash!
Fillet Away costs you half of your HP, so it's more of a B tier.
At 3:43 not to mention that Pokémon IS THE ONLY ONE IN THE WHOLE GAME TO HAVE SPEED BOOST
I think chilling water would have been good if it was a spear attack
Prankster Doodle Grafaiai next to Slaking can be pretty terrifying.
Does mausholds attack boost rage fist and if so thats 500 ATTACK POWER HOLY CARP
Small correction I think: you mention that after regenerator, shed tail effectively costs 17% of your HP to leave a sub with 25% of your HP for the switch in, but regenerator was nerfed to heal 25% instead of 33% so the net HP loss is 25% not 17%.  Still way better than half, but way less spammable
Torch Song also activates Throat Spray so can give +2 in one move. Not sure it jumps it up a ranking but cool to know
12:35 but your pokemon lost half its health
Flip Turn is a Palafin-exclusive U-Turn.
And still we don't have a reliable generic physical Electric move
Love all of the new videos Wolfe! Keeping me sane in the holiday season
So in other words, over half of the new moves this generation are game-breaking and will make it a nightmare for newcomers trying to get into competitive Pokémon.
Wolfey maybe slow down there was way too many mistakes in this video to justify the speed it came out
Torch Song is also sound based, so Throat Spray turns it into a damaging Nasty Plot. Silly.
Can't you use spicy extract on a special attacker?
I agree that Pounce is pretty mid in most circumstances, but there is a bit of an exception. I'm running it on Scizor because it pairs really well with Technician.
Mortal Spin is so good tho! It poisons BOTH opposing Pokémon, not just the one you target!
Finally someone other than me that likes Flower Trick mind freak the Meowscarada is coming
I read up the info on Comuppance, because the description raised some doubts. Like, does it mean that it can damage the opponent even based on the previous turn?  It turns out that seems to be the case, it works based on the last time the user took damage form the target, even if that was 5 turns ago. And it doesn't have decreased priority. So a bit different from Metal Burst, requires less prediction (at least in most cases I think). Seems like in singles it could be a good combination with a speed boosting move and Focus Sash, or Endure and Custap berry, to take down one big threat, provided that Mabosstiff or Houndoom can learn Endure or some speed boosting move, didn't check that. Though if using Focus Sash, Counter/Mirror Coat/Metal Burst just seem more reliable. And if I understood Comeuppance correctly the enemy can just switch out to negate the damage altogether.
Spicy Extract + Foul Play in doubles is lots of fun. Not *consistent* but lots of fun!
Revival blessing combined with last respects is amazing, it goes off of how many fainted on your team and not how many are currently fainted, meaning even in the official format you can get it to like 350 base power, and I think it counts all the way up to 100 faints, won’t ever happen in competitive play but that duo is quite the powerful gimmick, if you’re scared of it bring special priority dark and ghost moves, they cover the 2 main builds ran by houndstone
Wolfey rushing the videos faster than game freak rushing their games
Rage fist maxes out after 6 hits
22:34 So far Pawmot is amongst my favorite pokemon this generation due to evolving him bugging out so I ended up using the 2nd form my entire playthrough. Having a tank leppa berry setup for TWO revival blessings. Atk/spe choice scarf/band is another combinations I like when terralysing for electric type because this allows you to spam double shock without losing the typing after a single use and I am going to assume it works on Burn up too so an electric terrain or sunny day partner with helping hand will allow them to nuke other pokemon.  Ground is common so I would personally rate it a B. My friends have shut it down in singles but I usually take out 1 opponent pokemon down with Pawmot and one time I had Aurora Veil up so I got both revives with my leppa berry setup. EDIT: Grammar.
Wolfey out here with consistent bangers
bro was just wrong half the video LMAO world champ difference ig
Jigaton Hammer
You can use double shock, Tera electric and use it again
Wolfe: Please don’t use revival blessing.  Me: Then how am I supposed to win? 😂
So what do you think about scovillain spicy extract on, annihilape defiant, +4 attack. Worth looking into?
We could have a weavile beat up on the new ape (srry can't spell it's name), and then have the dung beatle revive it once it dies.   Paired with a tailwind murkrow and focus sash or choice scarf Rage Fist could be a biiiiig problem.   Tied with revival blessing in my honest opinion
Fillet away  takes half your health not a quarter
Soo there is like what? 7 to 10 new pokemon that are even viable. That is what it sounds like. Which I guess isn't too bad. Just wished they would have kept the paradox mons in and maye just banned fluttermane.
I'm going to need you to say what sound a duck makes and then think about how "Quaquaval" might be pronounced
my fav moves: Aqua step. i sweeped a poor soul in smogon with quaqaval that holds scarf and azumarill with classic subs-belly drum combo
Wonder if revavroom can be used as a trick room sweeper  Also edit: Rage Fist can also be learned by Primeape (who now can run Eviolite). Also it maxes out at 300BP so it does have an upper limit
Im wondering if Pawmot and Double Shock takes away electric typing if youre Tera'd already to electric, does it un-tera you or change it to normal?
I can see Spicy Extract being a really good move in Doubles. You use it on your partner who is holding a white herb and they get an SD boost. If your partner uses, like, Dragon Dance, they're +3 atk and +1 speed. I think D is definitely too low for it.
22:38 Terastalised pokemon dont lose their typing. So if Pawmot is tera Electric, then you can use it consecutively.
Despite the attack boost, spicy extract can be very good against a special attacker. Since they won't benefit from the attack boost, you can take advantage of the Lowered defense and go for A KO you normally wouldn't be able to get
Shout out to whoever gay plant is (appeared at 22:24)
PP up (if it has 1 PP)
Glaive rush makes the targets moves always hit next turn? Could you target your other pokemon with it and then use something like sheer cold the next turn?
Use Spicy Extract then confusion move, would that make it more viable?
Population Bomb is S+ too. Its so broken. Ive NEVER seen it miss and it always connects 10 times. And if you dont properly counter youre take major damage or a ko. Combine that with Tidy Up, wide lens and technician and you got a nuke
quite a lot of informational errors in this vid
To be honest I think last respects should have gotten S tier by a lot And was shocked when it got B
Wonder if doodle works on “zero to hero”?
Earned a sub, I'm all about creators that can go back and say yea I messed up after doing some furthet research.
Trailblaze and Pounce can both be learned by Scyther/Meowth lines. Poucne can be a bug bite-lite replacement for Scizor and drop incoming mon's speed. Trailblaze can boost but more importantly, can hurt water types more than BP can.
Rage Fist and Gigaton Hammer. Two of my new favorite moves, on two of my new favorite Pokémon
did we just see a shiny great tusk pass through- edit: it's probably not, but I swear I think I saw its color being brown with a pinkish trunk somewhere in 7:19
Double shock counts as a punching move
if you Terastalize into Electric Type, you dont lose your electric type when you use Double Shock, i assume Burn up is the same
9696 likes, nice
Daily reminder to like the video before coming to comment
The fact Wolfey didn't acknowledge that cold reception is Slowking making a horrible joke then leaving as sad 😭
"Glee-ave rush" said Wolfy with a calm voice.
Would like to make a point about Double Shock: If you tera to electric type, Double Shock will not remove the electric tera type, meaning you can spam it while tera Pawmot
Someone did some testing on Last Respects. Apparently the game remembers upto 100 KOs, so in theory Last Respects can get upto 5050 base power. I don't know WHY you'd want to waste 100 revives like that, but there you go. If for some reason you're fighting a lv 100 Dark type Arceus, and for some reason let it set up 6 Iron Defense and 6 Calm Minds, has 255 in all stats, and somehow is holding an Eviolite and is able to get the effect despite being a single stage Pokemon, then you have your answer I guess? Also, if you're fighting something like that, please share because the hack prevention measures have epically failed beyond all known comprehension and I'd love to see that chaos.  Also, is Revival Blessing really that strong? You're giving up the chance to deal damage or setup, to revive a Pokemon to half health. I mean, it's strong but you're basically trading away 1 Pokemon for another at half health.
I’m most excited for the new move Wolfe Smash, which automatically smashes the subscribe button and has the secondary affect of paralyzing the target watching your YouTube channel.
Order up does work still if Tatsugiri was in Dodonzos mouth and fainted
Hey this man to 800k he’s so good at Pokémon and has a cool name Edit: Get*
Please, no more population bomb crits, please no more
You forgot Jaw Lock which is learned by Mabosstiff. It's 80 base power physical Dark move that prevents both the user and the opponent from switching out until one of them faints. Not an amazing move but it exists, I guess.
Mortal spin also gets rid of hazards lol. So glimora can get rid of hazards
Nah rage fist with mouse hold cause hit 10 times on annihilape rage fist with have 550 base power
One thing you missed about terra blast is that it uses the greater of attack or sp. attack.
Ice spinner will definitely be run as miradon counterplay... so many mons get it, it deals supereffective damage to miradon, and if it survives, its terrain gets broken
Electro Drift probably better than Collision Course simply because of the abilities of the mons who get the moves. Both abilities are of course amazing, but Orichalcum Pulse's harsh sunlight does nothing for Collision Course specfically, while Hadron Engine's electric terrain boosts Electro Drift a further 30%, which is pretty nifty.
Lol love that Wolfey decided to show off how OP revival blessing was by using it to revive Magikarp. 10/10 best use so far
Chilly Reception has to be the funniest move of all time
Another thing about Torch Song, because it's a sound move, it hits through Substitute. I don't know how big that will be in VGC, but it's probably significant in singles.  Also I think Rage Fist does have an upper limit, but it's either 300 or 350, which is still really high.
doubles spicy extract with clear amulet?
I honestly preferred it when you didn't have such a frantic upload schedule because the videos were better researched and more insightful. Don't get me wrong, I find it great that you bring out more videos but as a player, I don't feel like you're providing the same added value as before compared to looking up moves on serebii. I know the metagame is still very young, but even so if I wanted to hear general statements like "I don't think Tera Blast will be used a lot but it will probably be good on some Pokemon" I wouldn't be watching a world champion's analysis, it just feels like you're describing the moves and giving a quick opinion off the top of your head. Still, I respect the grind and hope you reach the million soon!
Broooo, thank you! I commented this video request in your last stream 🙏🙏
Make it rain is BUSTED
mortal spin removes hazards too. it doesnt say so in the description but it does do that. now we got a new option for hazard removal! shame its a signature move now, it would be dope on Starmie
I didnt agree with the mortal spin take, treat it like a better version of toxic. (One that also does a physical hit and clears hazards)
Revival blessing. Though there are a lot of good moves.
Doodle actually is actually???or s+ tier as in doubles format, pokemon that have a weakening ability like slacking would become OP because of It  if he wasn't outsped and killed
But Kingambit can learn Foul Play, wouldnt you want to run Foul Play over Kowtow Cleave? since 95>80
Correction For Mortal Spin.  It is rapid spin but poisons.
This video is hilarious, future wolfey overruling past woofey 🤣🤣🤣
Pop bomb is OVER POWERED
yeah you're pretty wrong about Salt cure, It's easily saved my ass quite a few times and one of the reasons Garganacl is one of my fiercest pokemon
The other thing is that Quaquaval gets moxie as a secondary ability. So just slap a band on that thing and spam aqua step and get to +6 in speed and attack fast
Gliave rush 😂. Iconic.
Gay plant™️
Thank you wolfie. I've been subbed for years and always enjoy your content but with this gen I'm getting into competitive and your recent videos have been so helpful. World champ difference.
Wolfey on dat grind
Sorry Wolfey I am using Revival Blessing.
I can understand why you got Spicy extract mixed up, its so ridiculously terrible that its description needs several rereads in order to believe it
Torch Song also works with Throat Spray, making the first time you use it in battle give you +2 sp atk instead of +1
Confused reflect with counter at 23:37,  prepare to be exterminated
About Glaive rush, I'm still not convinced because even if you run protect, that would mean it's bassically a 2 turn move, I see it more as a finisher to make sure the opponent dies, but I don't think it's still worth using in most cases And on Salt cure, I think is interesting that you can add other DoT effects over it, so you could use it that while the opponent is poisoned and it would recieve even more damage per turn
Do multihit moves trigger rage fist? Like if you had a tandemaus with attack down nature hit its 10 hit move would you get a 550 power move?
The entire video I was waiting for you to put Tidy Up in S+ but you never mentioned it
Hope magmoartar gets armor cannon attack in the future
Cresselia's lunar blessing combined with a pokemon with revival blessing could lead into an extended revival sequence since lunar blessing restores PP.
Really cool to see this vid, however there are so many mistakes even after you edited in corrections that im pretty disappointed
Just noticed the great ace attorney music in the background
You are good at making lots of mistakes :D
Spicy extract wouldn't be that bad if you know the target is a special attacker
salt cure is godly in singles
Terra Blast is pretty great on Sylveon. Since pixilate gives a damage boost of 20% to normal moves, it becomes base 96 power (1 point higher than moonblast) and gives sylveon better coverage if it terra's into something like ground
17:51 I think that shed tail gives 50% subs so the full 50% goes into the substitute not 25% making very bulky subs  like equivalent subs from 140 base hp pokemon when uninvested if I am wrong I will take the L but I am almost positiive I am right from playing with it and seeing the damage it absorbs
In reference to Doodle: Slakoth is in the game
Tera Blast on Sylveon is solid because it gets STAB on it regardless
How does Double Shock work if you Tera-type into Electric? Do you just become a Normal-type or do you just become typeless?
gigaton once every 2 turns? Instruct would like a word
22:23 gay plant™
I used Pawmot in my playthrough and when it unlocked this move I read what it did and thought "huh, well this will be fun for competitve players"
Bruh Last Respects was so strong it got banned lol
Rage Fist does have a hard cap at around 300 or 350 I believe. Also, it’s not necessary for Annihilape to be good. It’s been wrecking ranked ladder without it. I’m not saying it isn’t good just that it requires setup so if you don’t want to bother with that, then you don’t have to.
Comeuppance should be compared to counter/mirror coat, not reflect
double shock can't remove electric tera type so while it costs a tera I do believe it deserves a B
Spicy Extract could be a killer doubles move IF combined with Covert Cloak
Dose annihilape still have anger point ? Maby combo rage fist with a move that always crits ?
My first thought with Chilly Reception was Slowking from Pokémon the Movie 2000 saying "I could use pants," in the snow. And you can't change my mind on that.
Wait isn't Spicy Extract kinda useful to use on your partner in double battles? You can boost their attack right before going wild on your enemy. Well yes it lowers your partners defense stat but if it's physical bulk is good enough to begin with, then it is no problem or am i missing something?
Twin Beam could be good because the first hit breaks Sturdy or Focus Sash and still has nearly the same damage as Psychic
17:05 Electro drift is even better than it's fighting counterpart, because not only do you get STAB+the boost from its secondary effect when you can get the 2x/4x boost, but you also get a boost from the *electric terrain* that miraidon brings with its ability *and* the ability itself.   EDIT: miraidon is even more broken than i thought.
I also misread spicy extract to be swords dance plus lower opponent's defense and thought it was busted. The first time I used it I was disappointed to say the least and felt dumb when I reread it.
I’m enjoying Scarlet so much. This is fun. And these new moves are mostly awesome.   Long live Pawmot!
Any point in terastalizing to use double shock twice ?
14:41 Just something to note, Quaquavel's Hidden Ability Moxie to increase it's already respectable 120 base attack and a choice scarf to boost it's base 80 speed would lead me to argue it is possibly S+. At the very least, the best move to go with the starter it has, especially since while Meowscarada has Flower Trick and the disgusting ability Protean, Protean and Libero got HARD nerfed this gen
Mortal spin also removes other hazards like spikes and rocks
Mortal spin, also Salt cure are actually broken. One removes hazards, the other is the twice annoying than magma storm or whirlpool. You were wrong
Population Bomb is downright broken, if you give Maushold a King's Rock to hold. Given the attack hits 1-10 times, and each attack counts as contact; let's say you get 10 hits in... that's a 65% chance to make your enemy flinch. This combination is borderline stupid if used with this mechanic, especially if you use Tidy Up a few times to boost it''s attack before hand... Maushold using this is downright silly, because even if you only hit 4-7 times, you're almost always going to make your enemy flinch. In addition, Tidy Up removes Stealth Rocks, Poison Spikes, Spikes, Etc.  I get the feeling this is going to be banned for this reason.
Wait wait wait wait wait. Can you use Copycat/mimic on your own revival blessing and revive half your team?
Torch Song also hits through barriers and substitutes due to being sound based. Is also affected my throat spray.
What if Dive cats but with Gigaton Hammer?
I thought chilling water was supposed to be the replacement for scald but 50 bp is just terrible
Just got a thing below this in my recommended asking me to review it, so as a normal person I picked 5 stars and ticked all the boxes so expect this to blow up wolfey
chilling reception is interesting as alot of sets for slowking already have a move like teleport. so if you pair him up with ice types i think this move definitely has it's place on a lot of sets
I KNOW these videos are made for VGC but I always love looking at the differences in competitive viability between showdown solo and VGC. A good exemple is mortal spin where it's simply an improved rapid spin that also poisons which is insanely strong considering how importsnt hazards are in solo.
Salt cure is actually a very good move. esp combined with garganacli's bulk. cuz while it can be rid of by switching, the opponent will be taking a great risk of getting salt cured on a switch in predict if they decide to switch and not attack/defeat garganacli. and the garganacli user can switch it out to preserve it's own health too so it can get another potential salt cure out, possibly behind a shed tail sub-  the damage deff adds up over time the longer the opponent doesn't switch or late-game when they have very few options left and garganacli's not dead yet.  and if they do switch? they can potentially be salt cured on switch in and the dot continues. its deff an amazing move that's essentially superior fire spin/sand tomb since it lasts forever. it basically can force the enemy to switch if they can't deal with garganacli, or if they can damage it like w/low kick, they still take a good amount of damage from salt cure due to its stall potential. not even including garganacli having explosion as a last resort move if it stall's used up or if it has to be sacked-  Shed tail is very interesting, as its usefulness takes into account whether your cyclizar has regenerator, sitrus berry/leftovers(latter 2 without or even with regenerator) or not. if it has regenerator? it may get up to 2-3 shed tails per battle, maybe more if it outspeeds and U-turns.  without regnerator? Cyclizar can only use it twice max if it able to heal on its next turn somehow(berry or leftovers)  I honestly think salt cure and shed tail are my fave moves this gen, they're amazing support for teams and shed tail's legit a substituter's dream come true
Just hit annihilape with skill link rock blast and you’re good to go
Double Shock can be used consecutively if your Tera Type is Electric, though because of how useful changing your type is and the fact that Pawmot has pretty bad bulk you're better off Iron Fist + Close Combat.
When I read the description of revival blessing I immediately thought “oh wolfeys not gonna like this”
I’ve seen a video of doodle Slaking wrecking teams, and when Regigigas is allowed it could be even more broken
Thanks to BonusWolfe forcorrecting WOlfeyVGC's mistakes
Wolfey why did you go to these scripted videos when you lose a lot of your charm that made me subscribe but still get half of everything wrong
Scovillain's signature move is extremely niche. This is I think for making a glass cannon EQ'er or other physical AoE move on your side of the field, or a weird way to deal with generally bulky special attackers, similar to Swagger, but instead of confusing, dropping their phys defence. edited after seeing you correct yourself 🙊
Hearing about Shed Tail Cyclizar inspired me to play Scarlet. I don't know if I will ever be successful on the ladder or have the time to really put into it, but it was inspirational.
Now I'm not saying that wugtrio is good, but I've one-shotted a non-zero amount of pokemon with a life orb/water terra booster triple dive in the online battles. I prefer to use pokemon I like over meta mons tho, so dont take this as a reason to use wugtrio in hardcore competitive settings,  but it is usable if you REALLY want to lol
Did you mean counter and mirror coat i assume
Fun fact about double shock: if you terastalize into electric, you can keep using it
small nitpick, population bomb isnt the first move to hit more than 5 times. beat up can hit up to 6 times and has been in the game since gen 3 iirc
Yeah… last night I had an opponent revive a Chi-Yu and a Gargnacl with Leppa Berry Revival Pawmot. Still ended up sweeping with Clodsire but at that point in the game it had turned into a 4v8. Not fun but I handled it.
Mixing up signature ability and saying that word instead of signature move might confuse some people
I am surprised seeing order up so low and watching you use it in your rank climb haha
"i dont think quaquaval is the strongest mon out there" bruh 120 base attack
I can't find the subscibre button... Future Delvin here, I realized I'm already subscribed, sorry bout that... Future Delvin again, my birthday is in March, it'd be crazy if you hit 1 million subscribers on my birthday. Lol
salt cure DOESNT end when you switch out by the way
Annihilapes move only gets stronger if the move it was hit with is stronger than rage fist at that time. Say your rage fist was doing 100 the move that annihilape hit with would have to be 100+ to make rage fist do 150 next turn. Basically you can’t really do more than 150 per game.
Population Bomb is S tier.
No new moves for the hisui pokemon?
Doodle was 100% made by a huge Slaking and Regigigas fan
Probably a dumb question: what is 101% accuracy?
I like somehow started the Video at the end but scrolled back a bit and ended up at 20:50 just see the background and thought wtf is this 😂
Look i’m not a competitive pokémon player but i think mortal spin is great especially in doubles. It can poison two pokémon at a time, it does a bit of damage (so it can pick up a low HP KO), and it removes spikes and all other hazards. It’s a better toxic and rapid spin.
I feel like bike mon is highly underrated. Shed tail is awesome . But he ice spinner and rapid spin allows him to destroy terrain and hazards! And he has access to rainy day and sunny day allowing him to control weather. And breaking swipe to control attack ! This mon can completely control the battle field.
@Wolfey Pawmi’s Double Shock can be reused if your terra type is electric. And your terra type won’t drop. Absolutely insane. Also with Ghost being so heavy in the meta with goldengo and the new Anhialape being able to switch to normal typing with something like a scarf or tailwind could be really nasty to immune to ghost and terra to reset the electric.  It has that plus revival blessing and iron fist and access to Mach punch. This little teddy bear can be a huge nightmare especially against something like dodonzo who’s meta heavy (and heavy )
You might actually be able to use Tinkaton with Powersplitb-support. When everyone has equal offensive stats hogh BP moves are much better. Aaaand this can actually buff your attack by debuffing the opponent.
I do want to say I like Terra blast because if you have a special attacker with something like Pixelate or Galvanize, you’ll still have a good stab option & you’ll have the freedom to Terra & gain another type coverage  Rip to normalize though, at least it got its 20% boost 😔🤟
1:48 gum gum battleaxe
If you use Sleep Talk with Rabsca or Pawmot and it calls Revival Blessing, Sleep Talk’s PP is spent, not RB’s. So in theory you could have many many uses of RB if you got lucky enough.
I've used spin out to intentionally lower my speed to attack sooner under trick room
The vids are great! Hope you have a nice day
I need Wolfe from the future to help correct my mistakes
Wolfey I'm gonna have to disagree with you putting Twin Beam in F tier.  Sure it's slightly weaker than Psychic but it has the benefit of hitting twice which means it can break past focus sash, sturdy, or even substitute.  I would at least put it at C tier since it's not the greatest but it at least has some use and is not outright bad.
Still got the b tier 😔
@wolfeyvgc I saw someone test annihilape's signature move and it does appear to have a cap of ~300 base power. Still really good, but there was no difference in power between 10-hit maushold (ring target, for testing purposes) and 5-mon beat up.
Wolfe I love you and your content but this video has a LOT of mistakes, a little over half of which you catch and correct, but still. If your goal is to make more professional high level content to grow your channel's subscriber count, I would take the time to re-record some of these segments. Great video, and I agree with basically all your assessments, but this video felt a notch below what you normally do.
Mortal Spin removes hazards So Rapid Spin is D Too?
Spicy Extract then your other 'mon uses Swagger.  I am not a Pokemon World Champion. My lesser opinion has nothing against Wolfe's greater facts. But you're already playing chance anyways since you're playing Pokemon, so how about making both you and your opponent have a heart attack each turn?  Toss a coin, see if your opponent OHKOs themselves. Heads, they get hit and die, Tails, you get hit and possibly lose instead.  It's not a perfect strategy, but it'll clench some Stunky-holes.
Don't underestimate Quaquaval:  It's hidden ability is Moxie, and it's signature move raises its speed stat, AND it learns Aqua Jet and Close Combat.  It's literally a no-setup, built-in revenge sweeper. You bring it in against an enemy with low health and/or low speed, and then use Aqua Step or Aqua Jet to finish off the enemy, and then just let the cascade effect take over from there as your opponent watches helplessly.  It's the Minato Namikaze of pokemon.
Annihilape Tera'd into steel + Maushold hitting him. Pure damage bro
11:49 bro imagine showdown vs Shedinja
Around 23:50, you refer to Reflect but i believe you meant Counter
Fun Fact: you can roll Revival Blessing from Sleep Talk :) do with this information what you will
At 21:19 you said there is no upper limit for rage fist. Some guy tested it and I’m not sure who, but it’s 6 for the upper limit on how much it can go up
Gigaton hammer
Shed Tail's substitute has HP equivalent to the health drained to create it, making it WAY better, especially on Cyclizar.
Doodle can yoink competitive or something like that which miiiiight be wild
21:23 no limit?? Does that mean you can just use that mouse pokemon move that hits up to 10 times and get 550 BASE POWER??
I wish they gave Salt Cure to Hariyama. As a replacement to SmellingSalts,
U mean counter* and mirror coat
Forcing people to Switch out or they take considerable chip is a pretty great to control momentum, especially against Pokémon that don’t get pivot moves
So primape with evolite, tanky rage fist
King’s Rock Population Bomb…🤯
Not to be too critical, but you had to make several post edits in this video correcting yourself. I appreciate the corrections, and I don't know your editing process too well with your editor but it may benifite the presentation of the video to just rewrite and reshoot those segments, after all you are doing a recording to do the mid-edit mentionings in the first place.
Revival blessing is the most overrated move ever created.
I got good mileage out of Aqua Cutter in the main game because I paired with Razor Claw. Landing a critical on (nearly) every attack is a good time
Hey Wolf ! Have you considered that Pounce is on Scizor to place it in the C tier ? (I have seen it being used) Thank you for your content, it's always really enjoyable 😁
btw silk trap isnt really better than protect since you can still get hit with status moves during it, which is a bummer
Anyone else pick up that he said comeuppance was similar to Reflect?
Run doodle with a slaking to get rid of truant
PogU Herlock Sholmes!
Gl-i-aive? Gl"eh"ve.... Glaive Rush... Also, it seems some channels that have the pulse on the analytics are saying subscribing as less and less effect now...
How is Last Respects Not S? One faint and its already 100BP Graveard is an Uber because of it
Hello Mr. Wideoman, you seem to have forgotten that the mouse demon gets a hazard remover that removes not only spikes-like hazards, but also substitute and shed tail, also it gets a dragon dances on top of that.
What's with the 101% accuracy on so many moves? Shouldn't it be 100% or is it some new mechanic I don't know about
Pop bomb working on "I hit you until I miss" really changes how to use it. Wide Lens Maushold anyone?
Completely missed spicy extract my dude.
I really like how you corrected yourself multiple times in this video. Just goes to show even the best of us can make mistakes sometimes
Scizor and pounce stab and technician boosted move with speed control. Plus bullet pinch for priority and speed control.
sounds like Wolfe recorded this on the same day as the ability video cuz he's got abilities on the brain big time 😂
Rage Fist actually caps at 350 unfortunately
wait how does spicy extract work vs clear body
Isn't twin beam effectively 120 base power because of STAB? 40*1.5 =60*2=120?
Idk many many pokemon can learn trailbalze
I assumed revival blessing was only on pawmot and then I was very surprised when rabsca learned it too. I guess it's only those two though, so it's still pretty special. Anyway it was incredible for my regular playthrough to ensure certain Pokémon got exp in a gym or something even after they fainted, and I used pawmi since the very start so it was one of my strongest the whole time. I'm excited to be able to use it competitively.  Between pawmot, goldengho and tinkaton I had half a meta team just in my normal playthrough. Throw in bisharps new evo which I eventually used as soon as I could feasibly catch a bisharp, and that's a doubles team right there.
Terra Blast attacking type should just be whatever your Pokémon's Terra type is, even when you're not Terrastilized. That's how I initially thought it would work, since it would basically just be a replacement for Hidden Power.
Scizor learns pounce and has technician.
Almost half of these moves he accidentally called abilities.
You said reflect returns damage, it doesn't.
I'm gonna regret this... But population bomb + Wide Lens is great. It makes each hit 99% accuracy. You get pretty consistent 10-hit attacks. And if you get a Tidy Up off, and terrastilize normal, even resisted bulky mons get shredded.
Spicy extract does not raise user sp.attack, it raises targets
Spicy Extract would actually be so useful if it raised *your* attack two stages while dropping the enemy's defense by two stages. The current way it works has no real reason to be used.
Slight technical correction on double shock: you CAN use it more than once, _if_ you terastilize to electric between uses
Where is tidy up?
You forgot Aqua Step
For future videos like this, could you keep the move info up somewhere while you discuss it? I kept having to rewind and pause to check specific stats like accuracy while you discussed it.
I kind of feel like they made Gigaton that strong to create this gimmick kind of pokemon that is only strong when it swings it's hammer, but weak without it. For that reason, I still like Tinkaton!
You did not just say glee-ave rush lmaooooo
Can you do a competitive tier list of all gen 9 Pokémon?
Ok but doodle can be overpowered  Imagine a slaking without truant ?
"Wolfey from the future" more like Iron Wolf
I’d love to see a video about which New tera type combinations you think are the most powerful
You are absolutely wrong about Salt Cure, imo. Probably one of the strongest moves in the game because its on a pokemon that uses iron defense and recover. Give Garganacl the ghost tera type and youre pretty much set. I'll agree the move without garganacl is meh
I have a pawmot with electric tera and I'll spam double shock
Wolfey just getting spicy extract completely wrong is absolutely hysterical
Gleeave rush
dude IMAGINE if scovillain's move worked that way.  You could make scovillain really bad otherwise to balance it out, it would've been such a cool rogue pokemon for competitive
Water Crash?
I was confused by spicy extract too, but it actually says boosts targets attack, not users, meaning the defence drop is also given to you, or the attack buff is also given to the opponent, or both are given to an ally... Thinking back, that's really not that good as swords dance doesn't have the draw back, so while it has some use in doubles targeting your ally before they attack and getting turn 1 double damage, or utility debuffing a special attacker who won't use the attack buff, it's not that good on yourself.
So they created double shock. The theoretical best buff to ice, bug, or grass you can give and they made it electric instead. xD
20:00 While Dudunsparce is bland as hell design wise, they definitely gave it a great signature move heh could you imagine if they gave Tinkaton the Huge Power ability? Then the question is who hits harder? Zacian or Tinkaton? Probably Zacian
I feel that Doodle should be S tier. I have fought a Grafaiai with Prankster and Doodle. Their ally? SLAKING.
I love Comeuppance with Mabostiff but if it's faster then it just fails
does doodle work with an ally slaking? and grafaiai gets prankster
I love bitter blade. I used 1 swords dance to setup ceruledge and swept the champion with it alone while around 8 levels under her mons. off a swords dance, the healing is significant, around 75% or more
6:36 beat up
could grafaiai get rid of truancy on Slacking?
6:10 that's just a car
I run plus speed nature and flame charge on my skeledirge to set up my torch song sweeps
The thing with bitter blade is I just set up swords dance and one shot an healed myself to full every turn
Ohh... dang! Picture using Population-bomb on Annihilape and then using rage fist!
I feel like rage fist would be insane in double battles if it also accounts for teammate damage cause you can just hit your Annliape with a move like pin missle and just sweep the enemy team
Ah yes, the famous historical weapon, the Gleeave
Electric tera typing let's Pawmot spam Double shock endlessly
Imagine population bomb with parental bond
Take a shot each time you see a power 80 move
if you can increase the PP on Revival Blessing then that is absolutely broken even if only usable by 2 pokemon
A video about all the move/ability changes going into Gen 9 would be really cool.
Wolfey, a lot of the info in this vid is wrong. Please fact check before posting next time Examples:  4:11 It can be used, only no stat boost 5:01 Target's attack stat, but you acknowledged this 6:34 Beat Up 12:40 50%
Wait does beat up work with rage fist?
Counter
Reflect deals damage y'all. Counter reduces damage from physical moves according to Wolfey here
Meanwhile mortal spin is must use in Pokrshowdown lol
f it, we gigaton hammer
I love salt cure. It allows fun cheese against titans.
Im womdering if you used a ditto against an opposing mon with revival blessing, if you could use it and then switch out and switch back in to get the pp back from transform???? I know that would only work in very specific situations but would be really cool
"101% accuracy"
oh god you can  give Annihilape a ring target and then have maushold hit it 10 times.
Order up if you Terastalize dragon is bonkers no? Combined with eating a tastugiri?
hey wolfe! i was thinking that maybe salt cure may be broken with a pokemon with shadow tag or something like that, i don´t know, what do you think! (ps: i love your content, keep it up champ)
I’m most scared of the new close combat. The buffs they gave it are nutty.
I have tactician on my maushold with wide lense so it hits 10 times every time so it hits 400 damage if I Tera normal type that 800 damage
Love this video! I think you’ve found a happy medium between off the cuff videos and informational videos.
for annihilape using rage fist does something like fury swipes affect the amount of hits and thus raise the moves base damage?
What's cool though is that you can Spicy Extract an opposing special attacking pokemon while Scovillian runs a Mirror Herb for +2 Attack and -2 Defence on the opposing pokemon.
You don't lose your electric typing if you terastallize
Baxcalibur not getting ice spinner sucks
Correction Spicy extract doesn t boost the user attack
Chilly reception lmaoooo
Population bomb plus wide lens gg
Did u research ur videos bro
Double Shock with Tera electric has potential, you can bait Earthquakes and most likely survive it and if you get a KO you have the chance to do it again due to Tera typing. Has down sides but to mess with your opponent that might go for a psychic, fairy or whatever after your double shock, only to tera back into mono electric is nice. You can also (obviously) immediately Tera electric if you feel pressured by a psychic attack and so on but feels kinda lack luster to lose double stab at that point.  I absolutely love stuff like this, but like I said, its a little bit risky since it depends on enemy lead and you risk your Revival Blessing user.
Gigaton hammer cause it is very silly
Mortal spin might be better then it seems. That “remove bind or leech seed” is the exact same description as rapid spin, so if removes entry hazards like rapid spin it be a fair bit better then it seems. For singles anyway, especially since its on glimmora who resist rocks and already absorb spikes.  (Edit) finally tested it i was correct mortal spin can remove entry hazards.
If you tera you can use double shock as much as you want well until pp runs out
I thoroughly enjoyed this vid
If Wolfe is from the future, is he Professor Turo? Mr Editor who keeps using Great Ace Attorney tracks, please keep doing so!
if I am not mistaken I heard shed tail was also like baton pass but it was not mention in the video so is it true or not?
Mortal Spin actually also removes entry hazards in your team
If Empoleon is hit by salt cure does it do 50% or is it still 25%?
If you have a leppa berry with revival blessing you can realy make somebody rage
mortal spin is good in doubles because it hits both people and also poisons both people
"reflect and mirror coat"
Thanks for everything Wolfe! Youre a staple in the pokemon community and we love you.
Can someone explain the difference between 100% and 101% accuracy
He kept saying Reflect does damage right? I did not imagine that, right?
22:23 gay plant started playing pokemon violet
WOLFE! I CAN ONLY SUBSCRIBE ONCE! IT WON"T LET ME DO ANY MORE! I did however make sure to like it c: ROAD TO 1M LETS GOOOOOOO
Use new infernape  Hit it with move that hits 10 times Win
I love what they did with the signature moves for the starters. Instead of breaking the traditions of having the pinch boost abilities or changing their BST they just gave them really good moves
Doodle slaking
Why do you pronounce it gleeeave rush??
Wolfey: Population Bomb is the first attack that can hit more than 5 times. Beat up: am I a joke to you?
Regigigas once again getting a chance
I love the future Wolfey, but I still wish he does not become a regular thing.
Love the video
Funny how chilly reception, an ice move, is only learnable by two non-ice pokemon
Salt cure should be ok a shadow tag pokemon
Dondozo: *exists* Wolfey: Dodonzo
Torch song also activates throat spray, which means you can double your stat boost with a single turn.
terastalization ignored double shock's secondary effect, making it spammable if you go electric tera. It's really good for band/scarf/life orb
Come & take the bus
Prankster Doodle gets rid of Truant on Slacking, no taunt Pokémon out speed and out priority Grafaiai.
Mortal spin gets rid of hazards for singles
Thank god anihillape is ghost type , imagine surviving a population bomb then hitting everything else with rage fist, would make mousehold unusable in that match up
Hear me out guys: Doodle grafaiai + Slaking
You forgot tgat teraplast can tuen physical too
I didn't see maushold's tidy up and am genuinely curious about it
POV: you’re looking for a comment that doesn’t correct the video
I think for Comeuppence you meant to say Counter instead of Reflect.
I'm glad I'm not the only one who read Spicy Extract wrong
Shoutout to Gay Plant TM
This video definitely need a remake 😂
With doodle you can remove truant from Slaking turn 1
Raging Fist maximum power it can get to is 350 if anyone wanted to now.
I think that Flower Trick is the best out of the starter moves. Having the crit and a great special move is great, but the other moves are good aswell!
Gigachad Hammer is freaking scary
cant wait for the return of urshi rapid that can jet punch through protect...
wait, spicy extract raises the target’s attack, not your own
Why do some of these say 101% accuracy?
Once per battle? Or can I change that with leppa berry
Past Wolfe  Dark Type  Future Wolfe  Normal Type
I am mostly a singles player, and its really funny how we have very different perceptions for some of the moves but it does make sense, as 4v4 doubles and 6v6 singles play very differently  Still hurt to see my boi mortal spin so low graded xD Hazards absolutely dominate singles currently
21:23 Rage Fist caps out at 350 BP, which equals 525 BP with STAB
Phantom force also goes through protect
Could spicy extract be combo'd with foul play?
How is the accuracy 101??!??!!
Glaive Rush, not Gliave Rush. Glaive is a weapon.
imagine gigaton hammer metagross
Technician Scizor with pounce, bullet punch and swords dance is my solo raid killer
Hearing Pokémon Conquest music was a pleasant surprise :)
pronouncing "glaive" normal people: "glay-ve" Wolfey: "glee-aive"
I love the Ace Attorney Logic and Reasoning Spectacular playing in the background. It really helps flesh out the logic and deductions of the moves being discussed.
Would Rage Fist benefit from each individual hit of population bomb?
If you use cyclizar and palafin shed tail could be really good
About Revival Blessing... it must also be stressed that your Pokémon can refill that 1 PP by holding a Leppa Berry. And the move can be pulled by Sleep Talk. This move is scary.
I kept waiting for Wolf from the future to correct his belief about salt cure lol.
If u tere a shedinja electric tera and use double shock what will happen
Gay Plant is online, and playing pokemon violet.
Even Normal tauros got the signature move? Am i dreaming?
The starter signatures just cement them as JoJo characters.  The illusionist furry becomes Killer Queen, the Florida Man turns into a singer (Stands are named after songs and bands since Part IV) and the white Daffy Duck steps to create that one JoJo meme with DIO walking towards Jotaro.
The amount of things that are just wrong in this video is a little disappointing, because even with the future Wolfe corrections there’s still a couple things like the Veluza move that are wrong. Like, even the footage in the background shows that Filet Away does cost 50% hp
19:35   What did you expect from a deity? All Hail Lord Dudunsparce.!
Dondozo
If you were to doodle your partner pokemon that has intimidate, would it proc 2 more intimidate activations?
Pair rage fist with foresight population bomb.
Collision course and electro drift only increase damage by 30 % if super effective , not 50 %
moves not abilities
So the moves are either really good or really bad?
Glad I'm not the only one who keeps saying Dodonzo instead of Dondozo
Is not mentioned but Tera Blast becomes physical if the Terastallised Pokémon has more physical attack than special attack. Unfortunately, it stays special all times if not Terastallised.
Loving the videos! I would be interested to see you do a video like this with a singles player so we can get their perspective. I know it's not an official format but it would still be interesting to see the discrepancies.
Ice Spinner is another great ice-type buff. Still think snow should damage and buff def just like sandstorm.
From Weezing with Regigigas last gen, we have another partner to slightly fix bad pokemon with Grifaiai and Slaking
Came for the moves, stayed for the Great Ace Attorney music (dance of deduction is amazing in the right moments)
6:35 Can't Beat Up hit more than 5 times as well? 6 times with a full team :'D
So for ‘Doodle’ I can think of something, have Slaking/Regigigas with an Iron Ball, or a - speed nature and use a + speed or Choice Scarf Grafaiai, then use Doodle, and now you have a stupid powerful Pokémon ready to Rip and Tear, it’s gimmicky but it could work
I think spicy extract would be good in doubles? Use it on your teammate
The sad thing about Bitter Blade is that it’s the same power as Wild Charge. Wild Charge has recoil, Bitter Blade heals. Physical electric types get shafted so hard.
Does shed tail work like baton pass? If so I can see some dope plays happening. Regardless it's S tier
Revival Blessing with a Leppa Berry I believes allows you for 2 resurections in a competative match. I havent tested this out yet.  So if im wrong with this please do correct me. Yes it cost you an item. But i think thats well worth the trade off
if you spicy extracted defiant bisharp it'd get +4 in a turn lmao
Hey Wolfe, good video but you’re missing a lot of info for a few moves. Mortal Spin removed Hazards, you’re missing Tidy Up from Maushold, Fillet Away takes 50%, Dondozo actually gains the dragon-type when Tatsugiri is in its mouth which makes Order Up STAB, and Salt Cure is going to get much better when Home comes out.
You messed up on Mortal Spin, it also removes hazards like Rapid Spin.
A little bit of a mistake with scovillain, it actually doesn’t boost YOUR attack, it boosts THEIR attack and lowers THEIR defense - still situationally useful, but closer to Swagger than swords dance
10:05 add leppa berry
You forget that beat up was the first move that could hit more than 5 times was beat up, not population bomb
6:35 beat up tho
I paired Torch Song with Throat Spray in my playthrough, ran over the rematch for Katy and probably Grusha when I get around to it
You said lumina crash was a signature ability, not signature attack
LMAO "EARTHWORM" AND THEN THE CANDIES SHOWS UP I'M DEAD 😂😂
Missed the opportunity to rate the new moves that were added in legends arceus because most of not all were altered in this game.
does Rage Fist works with multiple atk moves? Like if annihilape is hit by bullet seed 3 times it becomes a 50+150 power?
Correction for 16:30, the boost to collision course and electro drift is 30%, so when hitting a super effective target it gets a 2,6x instead of 3x boost. Still amazing, just less so
wolfey: "population bomb is the first multihit move that can hit more than 5 times" beat up: am i a joke to you
I’m just glad I’m not the only one that read spicy extract wrong, I thought the same thing until I used it in battle against the elite four and was like oh.
Its not “Duh-dun-zo”. Literally spelled “Don-doh-zoh” just read the name
And Wave Crash?
Tidy up?
Your hair is Floofy, not stupid. Very different
If Anihilape gets hit by population bomb 10 times in 1 turn, does rage fist's power go up by 500 points in 1 turn?
I'm not first
Rage Fist + Revival Blessing = A literal Nightmare!
Fun drinking game: Drink a shot everytime wolfe calls a move an ability
Phantom Force is shaking for not being mentioned and a Protect breaker xD
Imagine population bomb paired with rage fist Tera steel annihalape
Just a note for Tera Blast, it does get changed to Fairy with the Pixilation ability. It allows Sylveon to have a single target Fairy move and change it to something like Fire if you tera.
Interesting fact about Double Shock; Not sure if it’s the same way in game, but on Showdown, Double Shock can be used infinitely if the user Terastalises into an Electric Type, turning Pawmot into a monster
It's fun how you could possibly run an undead team with Houndstone and Annihalape(?) + Pawmot and Rabsca. Lead with the two ghosts, let em reek havoc and then revive them with Revival Blessing later and they both come back even stronger cause of their signature moves Rage Fist and Last Respects. Dunno if it's even viable (hard countered by a normal type) but sure sounds fun
Kanto primeape also learns rage fist
Hearing the masters music makes me happy while listening to Wolfe talk about how awesome rage first is
Is Twin Beam not a 40 base damage with stab but twice do more than psychic?
Editor you're the goat for using so much great ace attorney music, makes wolfey's videos even better
Terra Blast should've worked all the time
Does no one remember Fiery Dance...? It's basically Torch Song but Volcarona actually gets it...
Only thing I can imagine dual beam being used for is sash breaking in singles. Double kick terrakion but epic
I genuinely feel like Pawmot getting revival blessing was a coding error they just never fixed. Thematically it makes no sense for it to have the move, it has its own unique move, and this game is what it is.
Tera blast changes whether it's physical or special based on which is higher from the 'mon using it
what is the music used?
Hey Wolfey! With the new move classifications (cutting, punching, etc) I noticed that Sucker Punch isn't considered a punching move. I feel like this is a missed opportunity. What are your thoughts?
Doodle is going to be nuts once paradox pokemon are legal
22:23 for the guy of the footage, WHAT THE HECK IS THIS
Another content creator tested Rage Fist using population bomb to hit Annialape to get a lot of boosts, and noticed that the base power seemed to be capped at 150. Still strong but not as broken as we thought.
I haven't touched the Pokémon games since the original Diamond and Pearl (I didn't even play Platinum) but after watching your videos I feel like I want to start playing Pokémon again. Your videos have great production quality and the way you deliver the content is pretty noob friendly. I didn't know a thing about the competitive side of Pokémon but you got me interested to look more into it.
When you finally destroy pokemon that was pain the ass, and then you see opponent use "revival blessing": *insert tired wojak here*
21:20 Slight correction, rage fist's upper limit is 6 hits I believe.
It really takes you out of the video at the ends when the ads for other videos pop up. Maybe make your final point and and a short 10-second end card?
11:12 actually, mortal spin removes stage hazards
Salt cure is S+ in titan battles
Why leave in segments with inaccurate information only to have the correct information presented after?
22:23 L O L
7:57 spoiler alert
Not to mention that Population Bomb has the possibility of flinching your target
Shoutout Gay Plant(tm) lmao 22:24
Good video Wolf! Here is a comment for the algorythm ;)
Double shock is underrated, at least in pokemon showdown you can’t get rid of the tera type so you can use it on repetition. And a 120 move with double stab hurts a lot
Can't you play around the Double Shock drawback by terastallizing to Electric? I don't know if this really works but it sure felt like it during my playthrough. My Pawmot just murdured every single Flying Pokemon that Larry threw at me with this move
Thanks for the video
Population bomb is cracked. Wide lens.
6:59 with lens it gets 99% accuracy, which means this move now has 90% chance to hit 10 times. This means Maushold, even without Terastalization, can hit harder than Zacian's *UN-NERFED GEN 8 SPEC* Behemoth Blade more than 90% at the time.
09:00 did you just say...g-laive rush? That's...that's not how glaive is pronounced? Unless its an inside joke within your community, in that case, woosh on me :P
Wolfe I gotta say I have to disagree with your take on spicy extract considering the new items introduced in Gen 9 especially the herb that copied your opponents stat boosts. Let’s say you use spicy extract on any special attacking Pokémon, if you have lets say roaring moon as your other slot, it gets a essentially a free sd with the ability to ko anything on the opposing field in the same turn. While it’s situational, I’d still give it a b or c considering it’s potential in 4v4 doubles which is the criteria you’re grading on.
@10:00 I was worried that Wolfey would introcude the seperate "SS-tier"...
This video felt as rushed as the games. 10 more minutes of googling and "Wolfey from the future" could've enjoyed his free week-end ^^
Maybe spicy extract can be used on wall mons 🤔
how does mortal spin get D???? 😭😭 it’s rapid spin + poison
take a shot every time wolfey says ability instead of move
Dunsparce with protect break move and eviolite is so fun
Spicy extract can be used actually. You can use it on clear body mons to get just the attack boost and mirror herb on your ally and spicy an enemy, it'll just carry over the attack boost and the enemy will be -2 on defense
Amazing video Wolfe - high quality and super helpful and concise breakdowns!  But I'm going to need you to start saying the big fishes name right. It's "Don-dozo" not "Do-Donzo". I think it's based on the mafia title "don" if that helps  (P.s. if you insist it's "Do-Donzo" I'll email Pikachu and demand they change it)
Jet Punch plus Choice Band plus Tera Water is genuinely such a broken combo, and off of Hero Form’s Attk stat, it shreds through the competition
Double shock can be spammed if you are terra electric tho!!!
yeaaaaah spicy extract! I like to use it beside power trip krookadile holding a clear amulet.  Edit. Reflect is now counter.
I love the Great Ace Attorney music.
Looks like doubles are gonna have some Slaking Grafaiai shenanigans which I'd say in my layman's opinion it's gonna be op because you have to waste multiple turns to get an ability that is neutral (yamask evos) or even more turns with a good chance of failing with skill swap
Rage Fist hits like a truck out of nowhere. Often times you forget how many times you've hit Annihilape that getting annihilated (lol) by a Rage Fist feels like it came from nowhere.
Population bomb on technician maushold with kings rock is insane
is the only purpose of twin beam to break sash?
Annihilape is INSANELY scary.  One single wrong move and you have at least a 100 base power move just being spammed at you.  And you can't rely on a Normal type to counter it BECAUSE STAB FIGHTING.  WHY.
What was with that clip of Finizen staying in to Jet Junch
Mortal Spin isn't that bad, having a poison type equivalent of rapid spin that also poisons is good for hitting spinblocker ghost types as well as doing a bit of chip damage.
I didn't see if anyone noticed but torch soung us a sound based move, if you combine ot with throat spray, skeledirge gets a plus 2 sp atk after 1 torch song.
If you terrastilise Pawmot into electric type it can use double shock indefinitely
Ya Spicey extract is only viable against a pure special attacker. Also Rage fist caps at 6 hits. Still super strong.
Funny thing: You can Sleep Talk Revival Blessing. So you can potentially just make a Pawmot or Rabsca Sleep Talk Reviver. XP
If Scizor gets Pounce that would be a decent replacement for Bug Bite
Grafaiai pairing up with Slaking potentially makes Doodle S tier imo. Nothing scarier than a non-truant Slaking, and without needing the 200 move setup it usually needs to accomplish that makes it an amazing potential combo for the double battle meta. Edit: This seems to have gotten some traction. A double protect first turn protects Grafaiai from Fakeout, and Slaking from being double targeted. Or, yknow, teach Slaking Fake Out as well. Sucker Punch for Psychic/Ghost Types with a Punching Glove as the held item is a potential OHKO.  The Regigigas Grafaiai combo would be great too but I really have no idea what kind of matchups gigas is good in, slow start made me never want to touch it...
11:24 One word SLAKING
2:33 Basculegion also gets the move, for obvious reasons.
you can actually use double shock multiple times if you Terastallizes into a electric type, still probably a c tier move but really cool to know for other moves that are like it.
Wait what about Tidy up???
Fillet away cuts half of the users HP, not 1/4, and like a lot of others here stated you did miss a couple moves. Other than that I love your videos and look for just watching the next one!
Thank you Wolfy for using pokemon conquest music
Doodle can get rid of truant on Slaking
Torch song with a choice scarf?
Ice Spinner should've destroyed existing terrain and set up a new terrain. Would've been cool if Ice types got an icy terrain, sharply raising their speed or something since the typing is booty.
9:40 leppa berries
I could be wrong, but couldn't you use a Leppa berry to restore the use of revival blessing and since its a berry there might be a way to make if effectively infinite although whether that would be worth it competitively a different question. I know I used revival blessing more than once in a battle using ether against ai in my playthrough
🤔 you could put a ring target on annhialape and population bomb with wide lens on your own annhialape then use revival blessing, rage fist would be at 5050 damage...
Are we bot gonna talk about how he got an achievement called "gay plant" at 22:24 🤨
Tidy up is really good: cleans up the mess and set the sweeper.
2:50 With Last Respects, Game Freak cleary showed us once more that they don't give a shit about 6v6. This move is OK tier (and therefore balanced) in VGC, but on Smogon 6v6 OU, this moves was so broken that Houndstone ended up getting banned so quickly within just one day. This was brutal.
Double shock can actually be spammed if you taratolized into an eclectic type. So if you commit your tera you have a 120 base power move with stab and no draw back. But committing  your tera is a big cost. Either way maybe B tier if your feeling nice
Terratiype fire magneton with eviolite is a very good steel trapper
5:53 Wolfe  There is actually a tactic with spicy extract and mirror herb Basically if you have a fast physical attacker (like roaring moon)with mirror herb,it can copy the opponents stat increase I think you underestimated this move,I would give it a solid C tier since it takes some sort of set up to make it work
what abt wave crash
Wolfe, you get an S!
So hear me out right? Maushold with scarf (or accuracy boosting item) , Annihilape with ring target. Population bomb the ape and GG with rage fist
101% accuracy???
Leppa berry revival, blessing
counter, not reflect:)
What would happen if you doodle Tatsugiri commander ability then bring out a Dondonzo? 🤔🤔 I assume you can't but haven't tried it
"i dont know how to rate this move" "Yep i was wrong , S TIER "
:)
Hey your hair looks great
Imagine Weakness Policy Annihilape together with Beat up Weavile.
Thank goodness smeargle isnt in gen 9. Can you imagine revival blessing smeargle? *anticipation ability message here*
I think salt cure was created specifically to be annoying fighting garganacl in raids lol
Do I know anything about pokemon comp? No. Am I interested? Yes
Reflect and mirror coat? Reflect raises physical resistance. But I'm with you, I don't remember what the physical version of mirror coat is called.
Honestly don’t think Revival Blessing is all that broken. The pokemon that use it are pretty fragile, so they’re possibly giving their lives for the revival, and it only brings the pokemon to half health, which in competitive is like one shot territory easy.
The possibilities are so wild to consider. What about a steel terrastilized Annihilape that you Population Bomb with a friendly Maushold. And then run a Revival Blessing mon, and maybe a shed tail mon when you bring it back.
Hey guys is there a point of the 101% acc on the move silk touch or any move in general shown here?
Order up DOES work, and still gets its seconday effect as long as a Tatsugiri was in its mouth previously. Spicy Extract works with Clear Amulet, giving a +2 boost but not the drop, letting you swords dance an ally. Mortal Spin clears hazards,  Rage fist DOES have a limit, etc etc. even with the corrections you popped in to do there's still a LOT of mistakes in this one. I'm really curious why, if you remembered part of it was wrong, you didn't comb through the rest of the moves. Many of these rankings aren't useful because you were ranking a version that doesn't exist. I get you're trying to spam out content quick as you can, strike while the iron's hot, but I expect better from you. This isn't the World Champion Difference we know and love.
Shed tails sub is not 25% hp. the sub is based on the health you spend for it so the sub itself is also bigger
How does Pawmot's Double Shock work with terrastalizing? Cause you could use Double Shock, lose your electric typing, then terrastalize into an electric type and use it again?
You had to look up Veluza's name, but I keep calling it "Merluza" XD
I'm already subscribed to Wolfe, how do I subscribe to future Wolfe? That guy seems to know what he is talking about.
*smeargle has entered the chat*
Doodle might be strong against Weather
7:30 Population Bomb is also affected by King's Rock which makes it even more broken. Or if you use Population Bomb with the new item Loaded Dice the move apparently only roles the accuracy calculation once and then picks a number between 4 and 10 for the amount of hits.
Rage fist has been tested. It's upper limit is 6 hits.
Everytime you said ability instead of move, it hurt me.
so i think revival blessing will fall flat right now but when we get ubers it will be broken. the difference between reviving something like salamance is probably not worth having an underwhelming mon but if you suddenly have one and a halve miraidon that sounds like a positive trade
Population bomb+Loaded dice 🎲 😵✌️
I love all of these new moves, despite the clear power creep. The fact that the majority of these are signature moves distributed to one pokemon gives each pokemon a niche place in any meta. Hopefully they dont give rage fist to every ghost pokemon in gen 10 😭
probably not the first to point this out but population bomb is not the first move to be able to hit more than 5 times. Beat up is able to hit 6 times but it does work a bit differently, and its a pretty forgettable move so its understandable to forget it.
Why the hell can't Baxcalibur learn Ice Spinner?
i think double shock doesnt lose electric type if you terastalize
Salt cure is super broken in singles. I love it
Glad he doesn't know the true potential of Spicy Extract in VGC Doubles.
Why do some attacks have 101% accuracy?
The number of times you said "reflect and mirror coat" and didn't correct yourself 😂
Away take 1/2 of Veluza's HP not a quarter😓😓
spicy extrac on a defiant pokemon dudee. +4 atk
Wasn't there a ground type Close Combat learnt by the new Donphan?
Being able to revive in pokemon is the most busted thing they might have ever released, even if only limited to a select few not super great pokemon, it completely throws off everything we thought we knew about damage trades. Additionally, the drill move which breaks through protect really affects the pacing of a match, and I think an interesting balance tweak could be giving it priority equal to protect, such that it would still have the benefit of hitting a pokemon using proteet if it were faster, but your teammates don't get the same bonus, which makes a bit of a game out of speed stats, though perhaps priority would just make the move even better. Perhaps then make it so it could only be used when someone is using protect, which is still really strong, since protect is used so often, and there are a number of moves even just introduced that are big giveaways that protect is the next move, which could be a mind game.
Is it bad that when I hear Wolfey say “Wugtrio” I have to question whether he is talking about the Paldean or Kantonian Pokémon? 😂
Love the quality that you put out in your channel
Fuck it we gigaton hammer
Salt cure is a good move to me. Not the best, but considering steels and waters are usually what people use to switch into rock types. It could be devastating. If I were to use salt cure on the turn you switch in your steel, you'll be losing over a quarter of your health just from that on top of any damage like status or hazards. Then if you decide to keep your steel type in, there's goes 50% of your health. Pokemon is a game of inches, and potentially taking a quarter or even half of your opponents main defensive mons could make or break your game. Even losing 1/8th each round could matter, as that is double of what leftovers heals after all.
Thoughts on Paradox Forms being banned in competitive? Liked seeing the breakdown on the the signatures; hope a bunch of these get spread around over time.
uuhm just to correct wolfey population bomb is the first move that can hit more then 5 times in vgc in singles 6v6 we got beat up way back
Spicy Extract is definitely not D tier. If you are using it to guarantee a KO on an opponent pokemon, it's better than Screech.
Hey Wolfey. Just a little bit of consturctive criticism here. This video had a lot of little barely noticeable inaccuracies that kinda brought down the experience a bit. For me at least. Maybe try to make a video every week instead of every two days? Or, at least try take a little more time polishing videos. Or maybe this was just a one-off idk. We can all tell that you've been putting way more effort into your videos when compared to your older ones, and we really appreciate that. Don't trip up now! In any case, thank you for he videos that you put out, and I wish you the best in the future.
during my play through i used all the PP items i had to max out Gigaton Hammers PP and then i taught Tinkaton protect, i swept through a good portion of the game this way
I run Bulk Up with my Annihilape so I can take hits to increase Rage Fist's power, and Drain Punch if I want some of that health back. So broken I love it
He forgot the move tidy up
23:34 Reflect?
A lot of people commenting "you missed X move" Jesus christ watch the full video
Revival blessing and Leppa berry
Hey Wolfe, can you do a tier list on all Pokémon in the meta rn?
mortal spin gave me whiplash, then I remembered you only play doubles. It removes all hazards and can hit ghost types, so it's really strong in singles, along with being a status move.
Note regarding Pounce. Outside of one specific situation, I agree it is not a great move; however, the one situation it does work is on Scizor. Pounce gets the Technician boost and the speed decrease is worth the 5 less damage you’d get from using x-scissor.
Glaive rush does exactly the opposite of what you said, the reason why glaive rush sucks is that next turn you take double dmg and they can't miss, it's better just to run d-claw without any side effect and more power points
Soooo if you Tera Anihilape, and attack yourself with maushold you get a 550 power move?   To be fair not like the big number matters above the point of KO but yeah
With doodle, could you theoretically Give Dodonzo a +4 omniboost with the toxic Tastugiri strategy?
Wolfey’s use of The Great Ace Attorney music makes me happy
Hey! Small correction, I think Rage Fist caps at 300 Base power.
I dont think tidy up was mentioned
Idk what people wanna say but Max attack Max speed Choice Specs Moxie Aqua Step Quaquavel sounds like a nightmare, it can absolutely sweep unprepared teams even without Choice Specs or Choice Scarf.
Actually, imma gonna have to disagree with you on Spin Out. Revavroom gets access to Shift Gear, which sharply boosts speed as well as raises attack. Plus, Revavroom isn't exactly a frail Pokémon, but it's not bulky either, so surviving a hit before you attack is effectively a coin flip. It would probably be better off with Shift Gear and Iron Head.
The funny thing about spicy extract to me is that it is basically a hard nerfed version of screech, a move that already exists with a decently wide distribution
18:15 the description for this move is actually soooo funny, just imagine slowking just sheepishly walking out of battle because  it’s too embarrassed about the hoke
Okay so something he got wrong is filet away he said you lose 25% when you actually lose 50% but yea its still op
What i love about this, is that these moves can become egg moves in the future, so bad mons like spidops maybe be useful in the future just for that <3
something to note about fillet away is that it does more damage when Valuza has the ability sharpness so it takes 75% of your health instead of 50%
there was some testing on rage fist, it capped afther 5 or 6 hits making it a base 300 or 350 move afther. (test was done with a mon with realy hige defence etc, with the help of 5 hit move, 6 hit move (beatup) and population bomb, damage from the 10 hits from population bomb was the same that the 5 hit move was (target lived both times) i cant remember if it lived at 6 hits.
Wolfey: If pokemon like volcarona got torch song, it would definitely be broken Fiery dance: *am i a joke to you?*
Did you forget flower trick?
Correction: Dondozo's attack "Order Up" DOES work if Tatsugiri is not in its mouth. It just does not get the secondary effect.
With every move in pokemon to date, what movesets would you run on a team of all Mews. Wait this isn't bonus wolfe
The new moves in this game are ridiculously strong.  That's it, they're just that good.
Quite a few mistakes on this video. Take more time and make the video when you know what all the moves do.
Small correction on Fillet Away. It takes 50% of HP from Veluza, not 25%.  Basically Shell Smash boost for Belly Drum Cost.
Double shock can be used back to back with tera electric. Way better than a C
Graphiphi signature move could be good in doubles with a shed ninja and a fire type that can remove his typing and make him sweep everything or use double shock
Double shock works everytime while teralised
What would be the better held item for Annihilape? Punching glove or Leftovers?
I could see doodle being used to get rid of bad abilities like truant or slow start.  Also Double Shock doesn’t lose electric if you terastilize. That’s something to note.
I paused and rewinded when I was watching the spicy extract section lmfao
14:05 what do you mean if Volcarona got it? Torch song is literally the same as Volcarona's signature move: Fiery Dance
Wolfey using Pokémon conquest OSTs 🤩
Dodonzo can use Order Up without Tatsugiri. It just doesn't get a stat boost.
I didn't know the effect of Glaive Rush, so I thought Baxcalibur was just really frail
Population bomb + king's rock = inf flinch
Spicy extract doesn’t boost your attack, it boost your OPPONENTS- nvm you’re correcting yourself as we speak.
I think it is important to mention that veluza's fillet away does 50% health. it which is way worse than lowering your defenses a bit... veluza's stats also suck, with it being very similar to bruxish just distributed worse. the aerodynamic fish that dashes at you is not faster than the colourful rounded somewhat fish shaped piece of play-doh  also electro drift i would say is better than collision course simply because miraidon sets up its own electric terrain which gives it an additional buff, whereas koraidon's sun doesnt effect its stab moves directly
Regarding double shock from Pawmot, I'm pretty sure if you terastralize into electric you can keep using the move.  Also. Pawmot gets Wish as a egg move. That thing is just a straight up cleric.
Rabsca can also hold a Leppa Berry to restore Revival Blessing's PP, so it can be used twice or maybe even 4 times per match if you run both Rabsca and Pawmot.
From what I've been seeing Mortal Spin actually removes hazards like Rapid Spin. Also I believe Glaive Rush will double the damage of the next hit you take, no Protecting out of it
As much as I liked the video, reread your scripts! There were so many typos, and when you correct a few things that are said wrong in the video, it just draws attention to the ones that aren't left fixed. Constantly referring to moves as abilities or saying Reflect when you meant Counter is passible (when Comeuppance is more like Dark-type Metal Burst), but straight-up getting facts about Fillet Away and Rage Fist incorrect is kinda bad. The footage even shows Fillet Away costs 50% HP, not 25%, and Rage Fist caps at 350, according to Bulbapedia.
Shit dude I might have to use dundunsparce now.
6:32 it’s a move, not an ability, and Beat Up can hit 6 times.
Gigaton Hammer
One strat I've been doing with Skeledirge on Pokemon showdown is leading with Espeon to set up Reflect & Light Screen. Espeon has the bonus of getting rid of spikes through magic bounce. After that I switch in to  Skeledirge with blunder policy. If the target is slower I'll just attack and if it's faster I'll sing. I combined this with slack off and swept multiple teams on showdown
Fun fact leppa berry works on revival blessing so you can use it twice
Competitive Pokemon isn’t really my thing and when most people talk about it or relating things it’s extremely boring, but you make it seem interesting and really fun! Hope you get to 1mil soon :]
Wolf from the future is so smart
Order up can be used without tatsugiri. It just doesn't have the secondary effect of raining any stat.
I disagree with Spicy Extract, you can target pokemon that only have set up or special moves which basically drops their def without any drawbacks. You can also target teammates that do not care about defense. Situational, but strong
Why 101%?
I didn't know how Rage Fist worked when I first played through, and the first move I hit Eri's Annilape with was Beat Up. That thing messed me tf up
11:8 mortal spin also remove entry hazards like Stealth Rock Spikes sticky web exc wich is A LOT more usefull is singles battle execialy 6vs6 but like rapid spin that is block by ghost his poison type make it complitaly blank by steal type that lurk around every corner
Mortal Spin removes hazards so it's weaker rapid spin but poisons. Good move. It's a B tier also you forgot Tidy Up the other Maushold move.
What if you use doodle, and your partner is slaking to get rid of Truant?
Hello Wolfey,  I really like your videos so please dont take following critizism personally if you read this. Right now I am 1/3rd trough the video, where you correct your wrong statements. While I appreciate the transparency that shows mistakes in understanding happen, I don't think they have to be shown like that. It would make a much better flow if you just edited the wrong sections out completly. Because now I'm just sitting here and have to just forget about the last 5 minutes i watched. Sorry that I can't really explain how I feel but somewhere beetween annoyed and disappointed.  Greeting and have a good day
Vaultin Veluzas!
Revival Blessing Smeargle Letssssss Gooooooo
le wolfey saying the descrpiton of spicy extract  completely opposite
I see doodle working well with Pokemon like Slaking
any jigaton hammers in chat?
I actually like Bitter Blade, if they gave Ceruledge a little more Bulk, The move combo’ed with the Pokémon would be up there with Annihilape. But sadly, that defense ain’t that bulky. I dunno, maybe Assault Vest?
Wolfey mortal spin also removes hazards since when I’ve seen other people use it it had that affect and it removed the stealth rocks on my side of the field when I fought nemona
well.. urshifu signature move hit through protect too this gen mons, abilities n signature moves mostly good to great
I couldn't wait to use Farigiraf! So sad Twin Beam is just bad
Filet away is 50% Wolfe! Unfortunate that it slipped, especially since you compared it to the other one you misread
You forgot Tidy Up and Snowscape. Also, you *can* use Double Shock consecutively, I've done it. You just won't have STAB on the 2nd one, obviously. But you do not need to be electric type to use it.
Great video! The only rank I'd personally disagree with is Mortal Spin, at least in the 6v6 singles sense. An untauntable move that not only badly poisons the target, but also removes ALL hazards? (By all, I mean it also removes the likes of Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes, which, I know see almost no play in VGC, but at least deserve a mention.) It's amazing. It gives off the same vibes as Nuzzle. Yeah it won't work on a Steel type but you can't poison those without Corrosion anyways. Minimum A in my books.
Population bomb is the single most broken move ever. If it’s holding a kings rock it will just completely shut down anything it touches
Population bomb with the abilities Maushold can get is absolutely NUTTY. even if a pokemon resists, you're getting a good chunk of their health, especially if combined with an accuracy-boosting item
Where's Tidy Up? Dragon Dance + Rapid spin is kinda broken
When it was leaked i completely overestimated shed tail. I thought it worked like substitute combined with baton pass.
Mortal spin removes hazards too. It's  also a spread move(basically guaranteed spread poison)
Correction, there is an upper limit for rage fist which is 350 base power. I know cuz I’ve been using a maushold + anhilape team
I'm not sure if it's in the game, but if you give the Wide Lens to Mousehold (which boosts the accuracy of every move by 10%), Population Bomb would ALWAYS hit 10 times, with a 50% chance of getting a critical hit on at least one of the move, so it's essentially a 200 base power move with NO DRAWBACK!
17:50 some of this is wrong, you only gain 25% of your hp back with regenerator in gen 9 (so you end up paying 25% not 17%) but the sub has 50% of your total hp - its a much bigger substitute, so you only pay 25% hp for a 50% hp substitute and a switch
Appreciate the effort Wolfey! Great video
Mortal spin poisons both opponents in double battles and glimmora has access to corrosion. Poisoning half of your opponents pokemon even if they are poison type is pretty strong imo. You still can't poison steel types with it though.
Don't worry wolfe, I made the exact same mistake with spicy extract when I evolved my scovillain
couldn't you spam double shock if you tera electric?
Spicy Extract has one use, if you use it on the opponent and they are a special attacker then the attack boost is worthless and their defence is lowered but other than than there's not much else unless your ally has such horrible defence that they have to run Focus Sash even without the defence drop
Spicy extract actually boost the targets attack and lowers defense. So it's kinda gimmicky
Beat up can hit more than 5 times too but that’s not 10 separate accuracy checks so a little different than pop bomb, it’s kinda nutty if you normal Tera maushold with like wide lens or even muscle band and use that move, so much damage if kitted out a little bit
Day 361 of asking Wolfey Wideo Man to make "Why Scorbunny is a threat" because it's hidden ability is amazing. It can also do stuff with Sucker Punch + Weakness Policy mummy.
Hyper Drill is crazy. Imagine Dudunsparce was a bear and Hyper Drill would hit 3 times and is guranteed to crit. That would be ridiculous
Did you miss Wave Crash and Tidy Up or did I just miss them?
Did he not think of usuing spicy extract to his teamate?????
Funfact, tera electric pawmot can spam double shock with no drawbacks.
I will be honest and say this: With twin beam, I think it can be decent in scenarios where you want to (and importantly, can) break through substitutes as well as damaging the opponent. It's generally isn't as good but I disagree with it being on the F tier. I think it's more suited on the D tier instead.
Doodle has an insanely good situational use: removing Truant from Slaking and Slow Start from Regigigas!
you forgot about kings rock on Maushold, as that allows it to have a chance to flinch.. on each hit of population bomb
101% Accuracy? Damn lol
6:34 Technically its beat up Anyways population bomb has 99% accuracy with wide lens. That's a roughly 90.4% chance of hitting all 10 hits. Accounting for technician, that's a 300 base power STAB move that can force its way through substitute at the cost of your item slot. I think it's a pretty good move, and is limited not by consistency but by having to sacrifice your item slot as well as a normal physical move being pretty easy to tank even if its base power is insane.  Edit: Oh ffs I thought I watched till the end of that segment before I commented only for post-edit wolfey to come in and destroy the reason for this comment existing in the first place.
I think Double Shock deserves slightly more credit due to its interaction with Terastalisation, if you tera electric on your Pawmot, not only do you get 2x stab, your electric type cannot be changed, allowing you to use Double Shock repeatedly
One thing about Double shock is that if Pawmot is terrastallized to electric, it doesn’t lose it’s electric typing, allowing it to be used consecutively.
Miraidon's move Is Better since It gets boosted by Electric terrain
Order up still works without tatsugiri you just don’t get the stat buff
MERKtatDuck tells the truth
GayPlant
I want Tinkaton to *bonk* my dong
Revival blessing can be used 2 times with leppa berry and if you do skill swap to a Harvest user you can get many leppa berries soo yes it is ruining the meta game
Grafaiais Doodle against Orichalcum Pulse Koraidon while sun is active
Filet Away removes 50% of the user's HP, not 25%.  It also gets boosted by Sharpness, dealing 75% to the user if it has the ability...which activates Pinch Berries.
Spicy extract does have a use case with the white herb in doubles. It effectively works like swagger on misty terrain except one one use. Don't think this necessarily justifies using it but it is a use case.
I think you forgot Tidy Up, another signature move for Maushold. Basically DDance +Defog is literally insane, especially making population bomb even more scary. At first I thought it only worked if there was hazards on the field, but since it work whenever is crazy.
Rage Fist has an upper limit of 350 iirc
I feel like Salt Cure is better than C after having led wrong a couple of times and winning solely off Garganacl stall. The ticking damage adds up to a lot in the late game when they can't switch out anymore. That being said, it would be bad on any Pokemon that can't fulfill that niche.
Missed that Mortal spin also removes Hazards. Not that important for VGC but very important in Singles
Fillet away takes away 50% health
Population bomb on your Annihilape with rage fist could be kinda nutty
gay plant 22:25
Order up can still be used if there’s not a tatsu in its mouth, it just dosent have any additional effect
Whenever I think of salt cure I think things are switching in and you know they are and you wanna put pressure on it but irdfk
Wolf something that makes revival blessing really strong, in ou currently, people run it on pawmot with a leppa berry, so you can use it twice, which might be something  to be considered in vgc.  also, if you electric teralize pawmot, double shock can be spammed.
6:34 beat up hits 6 times if all of your mons are alive
Since when are there moves with 101% accuracy?!
I always have to remind myself we talking about vgc not singles lol
Just out of curiosity, how does Tera Blast work if a pokemon has an ability like pixilate and then terastalizes?  Is it still a fairy move at that point, or would it become whatever the tera type of the pokemon is?
6:34 VGC brained individual forgets about Beat up, more at 11
Not only is this a great vid, due to the Wolfe Cinematic Universe I can't tell whether the way he pronounced Glaive Rush was a bit or not 🤷🏽‍♂️🤔😅
Does mortal spin remove stealth rock?
Triple dive is surging strikes at home smh
according to bulbapedia, last respects can actually get up to 5050 base power if you use revives lmao. not relevant for competitive obviously, but still fun
if only you could use population bomb on annihilape and just keep reserrecting it
Latios is gonna cry at one side knowing that some other pokemon has luster purge but way better, ie lumina crash
Quaquavals aqua step is much more useful considering it has Baton pass AND moxie which allows it to pickoff opponents and pass a speed and attack boost. It's banned outside of AG and VGC,  but that's very useful
I thought the Rage Fist limit was 6 times? Seen people test it along side population bomb and it caps at 350 base damage.   Still great but not unlimited.
Kinda weird that he released this Video as is, even with the Corrections there's a lot of mistakes. Like a bunch of moves he said never miss, but actually just have 100% chance (meaning they can be lowered), him stating that fillet away takes 25 and not 50 % health, and a bunch of evaluations that make it clear that he recorded them before playing any online battles.
electro drift might be slightly better than collision course because it gets boosted by electric terrain( which miraidon creates)
Order up can actually be used without Tatsugiri, it just won't give a stat boost
Imagine finally putting down the opponent’s Zacian or Miraidon and then a rat / dung beetle just bring them back to life.
I love the Grade System! Please use this in any future ranking video. It's what *truly* makes the World Champ Difference.
can't believe that wolf forgot about tidy up, he should feel ashamed /s
Rest talk revival blessings can be used 18 times with leppa berry
Silk trap has a 101% accuracy lol
fillet away is 50% health, and 75 if you have sharpness for some reason.
Find a way to population bomb your own Annihilape, then revive and it's 550BP... for the reals?!
Love the video, also, I am not sure if this is another Cinderachi, but its name is Dondozo
Unless I’ve encountered a bug with order up but I’ve been beaten by that move and they didn’t have Tatsigiri, it was a wild one I tried to catch and failed
Surprised you didn't mention that order up gets the stat boost even on miss or hit into protect, which feels crazy.
if u use a move that makes the target not able to switch or if u have a mon with shadow tag then salt cure plus protect is gonna be broken
Torch song is also affected by throat spray so you can get a plus two to special attack after your first use.
It’s so dumb that Lumina Crash is just the superior Luster Purge.
for anyone wondering: 101% accuracy means that it will always hit even with accruracy drops
Gigaton Hammer or Revival Blessing
Population Bomb is actually the *second* attack that can hit more than 5 times. Beat Up hits 6 times with a full team.
I still think Fillet Away is good but he said it only took 25% of your health while the video in the background showed it taking 50%
Spicy extract is not that bad like you think tried use with foul play
Rage Fist does have an upper limit of 350, I believe.  Still insane, but imagine if it was unlimited.
Rage fist stops giving boosts after 6 hits so the max damage is 350 base power
silk trap isnt like baneful bunker its like king's shield so you can still be hit by status moves so it will often be worse
As someone who's getting the game for Christmas, you got me hyped for using spicy pepper boi just to yank my heart out lmao

Great Ace Attorney - Danse of Deduction? Let's go my man
Amazing video, Wolfey. I am starting into competitive pokemon now and it really helps with the understanding of moves.
Slight correction from a Veluza user for 12:40: Fillet Away costs half hp, not a quarter, same as Belly Drum
I made the same exact mistake when reading Spicy Extract up until I actually tried using it with my Scovillain
Can't express how happy i am for your channel blowing up in popularity. Thanks for all the hard work Wolfe, you earned it
Mortal spin removes hazards though
9:42 Do all status moves have 101% accuracy
Doodle makes sturdy Shedinja possible
salt cure stays upon switch out
spicy extract doesn’t raise your attack it raises the targets attack
The fact the most of them are 100% accuracy is crazy
nice
I can't wait for ranking the new pokemon
Hey Wolfey if you use Spicy Extract on a covert cloak pokemon does it just boost their attack as the defense down is a secondary?
I think the new videos are great, but I do miss when these type of videos were more unorganized like BonusWolfe.
Terablast more than hidden power is similar to photon gayser since it can physical or special depending on the highest stat, for this reason for me it is a b tier since depending on how you spread your offense you could catch of guard the opposing team Revival blessing i think can have two pp with leppa berry, hope a pokemon with harvest or recycle never get this move, for me since it's predictable it can be shut down by either fast pokemon or pokemon with prankster taunt Salt cure could be viable with gothitelle since it has shadow tag Both koraidon and miraidon moves should be s+ tier since , for koraidon collision course gain both 50% boost when it's supereffective and is also stab so another 50% but electro drift is more broken  its' like koraidon move since it gains 50% and is stab but it is also boosted by the ability Twin bean can be good to break sturdy so it's not that bad and has 10 base stat lower than psychic so it's not so bad
if/when they add the rest of the legendary Pokémon to the game, doodle + regigigas could be powerful
Why do some moves have an accuracy of 101%? Is that like actually a thing or is it just an error?
it's always great when there's a new upload from wolfey
Cyclazar can die in a fire bro who thought it was ok to nerf toxapex but allow this thing to have regenerator and shed tail
Ummm, not sure if you know this but you were wrong when you said that population bomb is the first move that Can hit more than 5 times because beat up Can hit 6 🤓🤓🤓
Sanji
Keep it up! Your hard work will pay off! Can you do a video on how to use every good Scarlet and Violet competitive Pokémon to its full potential?
salt cure is A
Literally every youtuber Ive seen mention Spicy Extract says it raises the users Atk I thought I was going crazy for a second but nah I guess people just can't fathom it actually being that bad lmao
Why is there small ant 's stream in Background while u ask me to sub
Ice spinner was a dream
Is tera blast always special??
Last time I checked you sub count it was around 400k you channel blew up (super deserved) Good job dude!
6:35  Beat up:Am i a joke to you?
I love the choice of background music at the beginning. Holmes's Deduction is such a banger Ace Attorney theme.
6:30 not a wolfey video without a mistake
1:03 , 101% accuracy , Lol
spicy extract is good youre capping
Love the vid! It's not quite accurate that population bomb is the first move to hit more than 5 times however, since the move Beat Up can hit 6 times. It is however the first move to hit more than 6 times, so the point still stands that it is a big difference!
wolfey why game freak and big N hate bug pokemon?
Early!
totsugeki
When he was talking about the protect moves I bet Aegislash feels sad with its King's Sheild lol
That's insane
Bleybleyd
My wolf sense knew a video was coming
Imagine. Unaware Skeledirge. Trick Room team. Torch Song setup, will o wisp, hex. Boom. Heheheheh. Wolfe has already come into contact with a few Unaware Skeledirge and was very confused why a super effective hit didn't KO. One he's SUPER tanky. Two, Unaware allows you to ignore stat changes good and bad. Evasion moves no longer have use in front of Skeledirge, nor do moves like Swords Dance.
i love this guy absolute W mans
When will there be all new pokemon
i cant believe how op cyclizar is
You are my favorite competitive player! You always help your fans to build the best team!
