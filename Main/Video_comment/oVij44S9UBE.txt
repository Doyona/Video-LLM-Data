What a fool
𝑪𝒂𝒏 𝑳𝒆𝒆 𝒈𝒐 𝒃𝒂𝒄𝒌 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒘𝒂𝒕𝒄𝒉 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝒗𝒊𝒅𝒆𝒐 😅😅😅
Look at how far we've come.
This guy is a tosser,  3 years later , he has changed his tune
Oh how times have changed 😭😭
This has aged well 😂😂
2024 Update: 23/24 Season. Arsenal took Man City to game day 31 and won, however, Man City won the PL by 2 points. Arteta is doing great for Arsenal.
Watching this after we finished seconde with 89 points, best offensive, best defensive, most clean sheets, golden glove winner in Raya and most wins in our clubs history.. booooooy have we come a long way. I was just like Lee when it comes down to Arteta.. I dont think I have ever been this wrong. Thank you Arteta!
Oh the good days 😂
We've come so far
We've come so far
This video popped up again in my suggestions.   He is still whining like mad about Arteta. He needs to lower his expectations and start looking at the players more...
Loool why is this coming on my timeline when we beat city 1-0
TBT
You were saying, Lee?
I'm just watching this in 2023. He was furious at the result and rightfully so. This is the definition of nothing good comes easy. LOOK AT ARSENAL NOW! never writeoff anybody.
Wow. Things have changed.
If only he knew what was coming 😂
Watching this in 2022 November. Arteta has done so much we don’t realise.
LOok at us now.
Come again lee Judges
11 months later Lee is singing praises of Arteta
Pretty crazy how correct he is about the Lego Man. Arsenal keeping him as the manager has been great for Spurs! Thanks Arsenal keep Arteta around!
lets hope the banter continues next season
6:07 😂
6:06
I'm a City fan and think Arteta is a very good coach but this game came too early in the season for the Gunners because they were not ready defensively.
Clear fans know nothing. Just let feelings spill out. Emotional, childish...
Goes to show how clueless these guys are
Oh how things change so quick
Get him out of our club now. What a silly rant.. Shambles he says.. Won more games than any other manager in this calendar year.. I am fully done he says. Sack him now...how do you look now lee.
and what about now? has he changed his mind :D
Muppet
Lee is my best
5ft4 midgets out jumping arsenal defenders 😂
Arsenal is like a Mini Cooper up against Formula 1 cars, you can put any driver you like into the diving seat but you wont be winning anything. Bigger changes are needed at Arsenal.
I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING HE's SAID!!! 100%
It could have gone better. But it's a game of football. A fan (and I am a fan of Arsenal) has no executive role.  We elect (through blood, geography or some other random driver) to follow a particular club and that is that. No club wins for ever. Look at Forest. Look at Leeds. Look at Blackburn. There must be more constructive things to get cross about. Apply for a job at Arsenal and sort it out.  Or.... Stop being so cross and shouty.   This poor fellow seems to have issues.
Happy 90th lee
Ty can’t talk smack to anyone with a lisp like that
pundits say bruce is doing a good job and yet they say fire arteta whats the difference between bruce and arteta it makes no sense
Love gunderlan
Lee was going on about how their CBs don't win aerial battles.  I think Ben White won only about half of his aerial duels for Brighton last season...
Love how Voldemort supports Arsenal
I am a United fan and imho this man is right. Arteta is out of his depth, trust the bullshit process. Get Arteta out and start the rebuild arsenal needs. You might decide to attack me or what a United fan is doing here but that is not the problem. The problem is the manager.
You had a good coach but you wanted him out and he won the europa league the year after
It felt like my volume was automatically getting higher as the video went on
Should’ve kept Wenger lol.
Youse had a proper manager and couch in arsen wenger? But no youse ran him our of the club and now youse are bottom Hahaha gobshites
yrrrrr
Had the players fought like lions and gave their all but still lost, I think the us Gooners wouldn't be so upset but when we roll over like that, it's absolutely gutting and embarrassing.
Yeah ty..and who wld that be?in ur"expert"opinion,which top manager/coach is gonna come to the arse right now?answer is nobody..unless of course youre taking over the managers/coaches job urself!!!nope.didnt think so....wind ur neck in bruv and let the coach learn and do his job!we aint gonna get relegated but our team will get stronger/better!!😒😣✌🏽
get back to not celebrating kane goals you baldy slap head loool
The slow descent into madness here is amazing hahaha
With 5 defender still lose 5-0
Under wenger they lose but still put up a good fight...  Now they just wait to be slaughter after letting in the 1st haha
Lee thought xhaka sending off wasn't cos he didn't get the ball  Red all day long
Did this chap have a full set of hair before he became an arsenel supporter
How this man managed not to say “fuckinell” is beyond me
arsenal will struggle in the 2nd division too if they get relegated
These guys act like Saliba is the best defender in the world!
Alright new to the channel and I’m in the states. Is this guy a regular, cause this was epic?
Don't sack arteta, he's made Arsenal an easy 3 points !
Azog a Gooooner?!?! ... Blimey!!!
Arsenal season mission objectives: 1. Get rid of all our best players ✅  2. Sign mediocre players for expensive fees 👌  3. Lose all games and score no goals ✅  4. Make sure we never get nike jerseys and look cool again 👌  5. Announce ben white as new prime minister of the UK (not yet completed)   Almost there boys 💪 just one more
1st 2 minutes is repeated and repeated on this rant....it progresses in volume as it goes along  for those hard of hearing.....
Gundoland! hahahaha!
There is no better coach at the moment other than Arteta. Let Arteta stay, or this club will fall apart at the hands of a new coach. and the big question is: WHO WOULD LIKE TO COACH AT THIS TIME?
Imma Chelsea fan I'm sure y'all don't care what I have to say but check it. Coming from the other side it hurts playing against Arsenal and not having my heart pumping wondering "are they gonna get us this time are we gonna loose?" Like I used too. I was concerned back in the days when playing Arsenal like I am now when we play Man U, Man C, Liv, Madrid, Bayern, PSG, ATM etc. Arsenal should be on that level of competition UCL top four in the prem y'know. Do I want Chels to be #1 as much as possible fuc ya. I also want my rivals to do the best they can because this is sports and it's always funnest when we're all truly competing at a great level and it's unpredictable like Madrid and Barça this past decade always a crazy match(now eh).  Arsenal, being Arsenal I should be shitting it when Chelsea and Arsenal play not expecting a W. What y'all did to us last year in the FA cup should be the bear minimum and y'all know it.   Arteta needs to kick rocks, Kroenke needs to scram y'all should fcn protest or something. Pinch their wallets and the owners will listen. Arsenal bottom of the table haven't scored no points, lowest in the clubs entire history. If Arsenal God forbid get relegated dude riots all over London. Maybe that's what needs to happen.   I'm aware I'm preaching to the quier here but I guess I'm saying I feel your pain it's not fair to your clubs legacy and something needs to happen... like yesterday, Cheers.
I’m a Man City fan and this is hilarious but I do give Arsenal respect for staying and thanking the fans.
Has Lee not got a season ticket this season?
I hope to hear Lee doing a lot more ranting this season. COYS.
They will change there minds again if they beat Norwich
Lee was spot-on !
lol. you think that things will magically improve with a new coach?
Would Arsenal fans Be happy to bring in Eddie Howe??? Go bk to basics, Need to climb the table, I’m a Spurs fan I do not see Arsenal going down, even tho I’m loving it looks like an hard season again!!! I don’t believe Conte would take the mess off Arsenal the only two Managers I see are, Eddie Howe or Paulo Foncesa!!!!
DT not taking a break he hiding coz were he backed this man all season long till the europa league semi finals
Don't sack Arteta, Arsenal under Arteta became THE INVISIBLES
What....a performance..
Thats a 10 minute timelapse on Lee's vein growing
Instant classic
lacazette and odegaard use manscaped ?
Lee single handedly carrying this channel now
Mourinho in.
Gatdamn man still blaming Wenger 😁
Sad pathetic little man
Kroenke most bring back the invincible Arsenal and this is the time.
Norwich game is irrelevant
need that mic cover washed.
Bring back Dick Emery, he’s good but not as funny as the Arse lol, super club.
Bring back Emery 😀
Absolute meltdown 😂
Where's DT gone I'm missing him nearly having a heart attack each week
Where's DT nowadays lads? Has he finally got sick of watching Arsenal play?😂
Woolwich need bendtner back 😂😂😂.  Coys
Arsenal fans are paying the price for being disloyal to the best ever manager who coached this club. Remember "Wenger Out"?
All I got from this was the Grammar Mistake:  " A SHAMBLES! "   " A SHAMBLES! "
new coach new team new owner new head of transfers
Eder militao interviewing lord voldermort
God, can you imagine if Claude were still alive to see this? He must be rolling in his grave.
As a Spurs Fan I understand his point of view, He's a real fan, worst manager ever !
No club with serious ambition hires a manager who has no management experience. And look at the shite they are being linked with during transfer windows… if Arsenal had signed all of their realistic transfer targets this year they’d still be hopeless.
His chosen not to have Guenduzi, Torierra, for Xhaka and Elneny.
Country in a effing mess but people get mad about kicing a ball of wind.were all screwed by shite mps.....
Yeah get rid of Ozil...club has no ambition.odegaard please..
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Panto started early in North London
5 foot 4 migits🤣🤣
This is like being in a serious situation and you not supposed to laugh then you hear a crack and its done🤣
When Lee starts dragging and restarting his words you know your in for a good video , man building up his anger inside 😂😂😂
On his bday no less hahahah
Started of on simmer , went to full boil over.
Just bring Eddie howe plz
Johnny Sins got a point
Please call Unai Emery and apologize to him. And make him return. ARTETA is not ready. He should be in the championship...
How is xhaka a arsenal player,shocking
What happened to DT
Thanks, Lee! ARTETA HAS GOT TO GO IMMEDIATELY! I can't deal with this pressure from a totally clueless f*** team!!
Lee snapped
Arsenal in the ESL? Bwahahaha 🤣🤣
The slow build up that turns into a full blown barny is utterly hilarious!
Ty is a coward he won't give an interview
😂
Aftv and chill 🍿
This guy is the definition of an angry cockney
Never wanna hear untouchables or big club again! Losers!
What worries me is that man city didn't even come out of 2nd gear
Even the scarfs hanging around are shaking once Lee screaming.......it is painful to be Arsenal supporter sorry for Scarfs tho
It was funny now its just sad 2 watch
Listen… apart from Brentford lose I don’t think a win was expected, watch we go on a win run now…
Finished club 😆😆
We also let go Mavropanos 🚶
Arsenal football club are run by a bunch of non ambitious clowns 🤡 from the top,middle and to the bottom.  They employ a manager/coach/rookie and his backroom staff all clowns 🤡 who are destroying our beloved club. After 5 decades a fan I'm deluded,  disappointed, disgusted, angry and all fired 🔥 up. Always Arsenal.
You keep talking up ben white but he's been dreadful so far
He’s always got the best interview no long talk love watching him when They lose what a feeling
He won the FA cup in his debut season please remember that. The standard of football In the EPL these days is very high level now a days.  Arsenal will be winners again our luck will change!
Where is mr dt
Arsenal should try and get zidane.
The man said 5 foot 4 midgets 🤣🤣🤣🤣
look. arsenal is going down. stop pretending your great club.
Mad when you realise he is speaking pure facts from the heart
Really should say how he feels.
host needs to do himself a favour too and leave aftv
As a Lfc fan, ive no doubt Arsenal will finish 7-8th. Let gabriel and white partnership happen and partey lokonga and it’ll all be sorted
Relegated
"The Process" was a hook, line, and sinker. It's ok to admit, and move on with grace.
Mikel doesn't know his best 11 fr nothing is working at ARSENAL. It's a shame seeing my team play that way all I have to say is Mikel is just out of tactics. Mikel out out out out please
5 foot 4  midgets is exactly the content I needed! Lee is a legend.
00:00 to 01:00 - Idling at the lights. 01:01 to 02:00 - Engage 1st gear, fingers tapping on handbrake. 02:01 to 03:00 - Revving the engine to 4000 RPM. Lights turning from red to amber. 03:01 to 04:00 - Eyeballing the geezer in the car to his left. That geezer has the sense to keep looking ahead even though he can see Lee in his peripheral vision. 04:01 to 05:00 - Handbrake disengaged. Rear wheels beginning to spin. Smoke envelops the car behind. 05:01 to 06:00 - Clutch is screaming. Green light. And we're off......2nd gear, 3rd gear, 4th gear. 06:01 to 07:00 - Radio volume has increased automatically due to speed of vehicle. Both hands gripping steering wheel hard. 07:01 to 08:00 - Red light ahead. So slowing down a bit now. Don't want any points on the licence (no pun!) 08:01 to 09:00 - Lee's worried about his engine. So lifts foot of gas and applies the brakes a little. 09:01 to 10:00 - Pulls up at lights. Geezer in car to the left arrives a few seconds later, still doesn't make eye contact. 10:01 to 10:26 - Stalls it.
"5'4" midgets" LEE YOU'RE KILLING ME JAJAJAJAJA
He's right tbf, City were always gonna beat arsenal so they shoulda used it to work on defensive shape and such
I love this game 🤣🤣🤣
618k views!! People really wanna hear Lee’s thoughts!!
Fans you HAVE to go on strike. The players will be grateful because they don't respect their manager and to get him to go will take something dramatic. Arsenal finished 8th last season, double that to 16th if things stay the way they are...
Can Eder Militao play instead of Chambers instead of doing interviews here?
SHAMBLES!!!!
Even as a Liverpool fan, I'm not amused-know only to well what you guys are going through. Chin up, someday Arsenal will be back and don't blame Arteta, that's the squad given to him. Cheers ☺
Love the way his analysis starts in a very calm Manor and gradually builds up into an aggressive frenzy. There was a certain Chancellor in the 1930s who made speeches in the same manner. No comparisons of course though. I love Lee, he's brilliant.
If you get relegated maybe you can come 3rd next season 😂
It's even funnier after the Spuds won again..
As  a City fan who was at the game, I have to say it was the reverse of City v. Arsenal games 10 - 15 years ago, when we used to dread having to face Vieira, Petit, Henry, Bergkamp etc. We only had Sun Jihai, Joey Barton, Richard Dunne  and Giorgios Samaras, (cows’ arses and banjos spring to mind), and usually got well stuffed. On one occasion we were 4-0 down at home after 20 minutes till Arsenal took pity on us, and we only lost 5-1. I admire Lee’s passion for his club, and he is spot on with many of his criticisms, but the decline predates Arteta’s arrival. They have been on the slide for many years, but Arteta doesn’t seem to be able to stop it. I really can’t understand how they could field two left backs in Tierney and Kolasinac, yet still concede 3 from right wing crosses. Chins up though Gooners - we have been down there too, and know how you feel, but nobody ever got relegated in August.
Lee gradually gets angrier 😂
Arteta wouldn't get a job in a Sunday League team.
Wheres DT
dont blame manager its the players, 12 months ago you were praising Arteta. Joker
Too many players at the club too long, xhaka, Chambers, bellerin, holding, laca, kolashinac.
'We are now getting beat in the air by 5 ft 4 midgets' LOL
Thomas partey party t t t hard
Arsenal Fans Lives Matter ✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿
Lee Judges anger: 0:00 talking, not really angry 2:30 MILD anger 3:40 MEDIUM fury 4:53 CONSIDERABLE 5:00 FULL LEE RANT!
Trust the  process
4:30 is when his anger blooms
Arsenal are crap LOL
It never worked last 2 seasons its not gonna work even if you give him 500 million he cannot improve this team he's out of his depth wrong choice get him out yrsterday different manager get  Big Sam NOW. Hes taking us down.hes a #2 not Arsenal manager.
Spurs at the top, Arsenal at rock bottom lord have mercy I‘ve seen it all
I feel bad that it was his birthday
where is Mr DT
One of the best neck workouts demonstrated by lee
COYS
What happened to the old guys? Robbie, DT, Troopz, Ty etc.? They were more fun to watch after arsenal defeats!
MIND THE GAP !!!!
Arteta should go he is very bad coach.
Looks like dobby the house elf is an arsenal fan
This interview is killing me 😂😂😂😂 Lee is the best
I'm a united fan just came here to laugh and tell you guys we just beat your small record ..28 games unbeaten .. just a suggestion you guys can go on a run of 28 losses .. that's quite a record too guys 😂😂😂😂
Donald Trump is exploring the possibility of purchasing Arsenal.
How Long do we still endure with this embarrassments. Arteta's arrogance is shocking
Holding and Chambers, central defenders.. 😳😩😭
Have faith in Arteta, trust the process!
I used to have a bit of time for this bloke. Then I saw him not celebrating England goals in the Euros because they were scored by a Spurs player and realised he's a sad pathetic man.
Seriously, how can Gündogan beat a premier league defender in the air? That’s unthinkable.
Wenger in.
Scroll down f.c
Where’s DT??
Lee is right , spot on
He's like a Pixies record......soft,loud.
When are we playing Arsenal lol
Where do we go from here???? Is it down to the lake I fear
He is totally correct!
Don't panic I think you will stay up😂😂😂😂😂
This coach and board and owner must go…
I will never feel sorry for Arsenal ungrateful supporters to how they  disrespectful Arsene Wenger
Chambers suck
good ebening
I can't breath 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂 whoooooooo  COYS,TOP OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If we dont laugh were gonna get angry and cry... spot on 👌🏽😂🤣
There’s nobody better than pep and arteta
You have to sack this man
All this man ever does is shout and go over the top. BORING!!! The shouting is not necessary, it just distracts away from the point(s) he is trying to make. It also is not a good image for AFTV. He needs to learn how to make a point and not get over excited and not finish his point. I shall definitely not watch him anymore. Robbie had learnt the correct way to make a point and the show is now better for it.
.38 million genuine sub's, 1 million neutral's. Classic entertainment, long may it continue because I'm not sure what I'd do without these idiot's. Thank's lad's.
Ahaha i miss dt up the spurs
As an honest Arsenal fan I'm disgusted that you don't trust the process. In all my years, I've never seen a coach tactically better than Mikel Arteta and I think he's the best coach we ever have had. Back him and trust the process. We can still do this! We are Arsenal! COYG! ❤️
Why would a top coach like Conte want to come to Arsenal. It needs more then a better coach, starting from the owners right through to the coach and players. It could be alot worse, you could be playing the top teams every week in your "Super League"
With hindsight Ancelotti would have been the more solid choice.  Trophies, composure, eloquence, experience  We went with the cheap option  Remember buy cheap, buy twice
Teams that usually go for it against city imo usually do better
His voice and accent makes it 10 times better / savage.
Tottenham Hotspur top nomads bottom 🤣 🤣 🤣
So bad at interviewing
Chambers holding Mari what team in the prem would they start for. Saka  tierney and smith-Rowe only ones atm doing anything. Auba looks like he’d rather be anywere else. Why would conte go there.
That fall from grace by Arsenal hasn't been helped by AFTV one bit. When are you going to realise it's you and and your stupid channels that's been a big problem at your club for years. Fickle and shocking supporters.
I can't stop laughing 😂😂
"Arteta is a genius"...Pep.
Many happy returns Lee from a Man City fan, you have true passion for your club.  There will be a time when the Gunners will come back.  I think Conte would be a good choice for the Gunners.
Arteta out
You wont anything with chambers holding in your team
Chelsea fan here. Watched the game yesterday & was shocked how bad the players attitudes were. No drive, no effort, no support, no off the ball movement, no marking in the box...no nothing. Hope you guys turn things around soon.
You have to do more demonstration against that
Goon do lan
I'm glad I didn't watch this game... I won't watch any arsenal game anymore
Don’t follow football but my m8’s a solid Arsenal fan, I ripped him at Brentford, I teased him about Chelsea but now I kinda feel he needs a soft blanket, a stream and some soothing music.   The fun is gone, it is like repeatedly kicking his premature kitten whilst he looks on helpless with no way of defending it.
You can put Jesus christ himself in front of this team and it won't change a thing. It's a beyond average squad who have no self belief whatsoever.
He's had enough but you will still see him nxt week saying the same thing what a joke. You ain't had enough
Lee " shambles" Judges 😂
What happens to Wanger out 😂
Sorry, those fans who went up there today DO deserve what they got. You should be protesting against the con trick of the last 12 years, not supporting it.
!00% its sad now cause i expect it
Arteta should go long time ago he is not good
I support Man Utd and I agree with everything Lee is saying...we need the glory days of the rivalry back...really miss those days and I hope you guys get back to that sort of a level 🤜🏻🤛🏻
Lees temper accelerates likes my little 1litre Citroen 😭 it takes a while but it's all beast mode when it gets warmed up
Cartel💲💲💲💲💰💰💰💰😎😎😎😎
Anyone: "How you doing Ty?"  Ty: "But why didn't he give him a card though?!"
Arsenal got manscaped.
I'm 5-4 I'm a midget..lol
Roy Hodson is available. 😂
Lee's bipolar slowly creeped in
U the fans I'm England are to blame as well ...no protest ..nothing from u guys ..u only care about view ...u guys billed up banter for wenger to leave ..where is arteta protest ???????he should be blame ..saliba should be there ..he wouldn't have to use
Chambers + holding + the other guy = 5 😂
Man City don’t score headers? Raheem sterling at the emirates last season🤣🤣🤣
Wenger needs to return ASAP!
Dobby's not happy ...
What happened to DT?
I’m a Liverpool fan and Nat Phillips was a hero for us last season but won’t get much game time this season. Arsenal should take him in before the window ends
Learn to park that damn bus. There is a team in London that Arteta can understudy.
Arteta is clueless saliba is way better than these defenders he needs to leave now.
tinpot club banter fc
Chambers,elneny and holding out
ARTETA OUT
Hahahaha puny invincibles
No proper coach will come here tho LOL
I wish unai Emery was in now
For years now our defense has been crap, A new experienced coach will help but the damage was done years ago, Werner was there too long and we didn’t improve our player list also the owner has to be accountable for the decisions of the club.
Regardless of the manager Arsenal fans have to accept that they are a poor team and the players are poor. Yes the system Arteta is using is poor and does not get or allow the players to be at their best
I hope this muppet enjoys his last coaching moments because no one will touch after he's booted out of Arsenal. Waste of space...
I want to see how long it takes for Arsenal fans to realise it’s not just the manager that’s the issue
Only positive was the people who traveled up to Manchester so early
Kolasinac is not being played because he was friends with Ozil
Most the city players shorter than Judges nd every cross made my heart sad city are not a big physical side ...
Lee you have to trust the process :)
You didn't see the arguing between Mari and Arteta at Brentford game
The only person on this channel who is worth listening to 😁
The job is to big for Arteta and who’s gonna want to come in and take over this mess
I grew up watching the unbeatable arsenal ( henry, Viera,bergkamp etc..) but now they are getting hammered. Why keep the name arsenal when there is no fire in the cannon...
Hey everyone, i’m not from uk nor english is my native language. Do you know which accent he has? Is it cockney?
Arsenal will be the Werder Bremen or Schalke 04 of the Premier League...
Where’s TY and DT? They’re the only ones I want to watch when they get battered😂😂
You can see that the players generally aren't good enough. You can see that the manager isn't good enough. We thought Wenger wasn't good enough in the end, but he was. The constant during our soon 20 years of decline is kroenke. To complain about the the manager or players is to complain about headache. But you don't ask why you got headache. Arteta is our headache but the reason we have "Arteta the headache" is "Kroenke the reason". As long as Arsenal have Kroenke they will always have headache in the area of players, managers, board.   Even though we bring in Conte we will not win titles since he will not have the needed surrounding. We can minimise the headache with the panadol Conte and perhaps by changing the back 4 minus Tieny. Headache xhaka can be sold but I believe it's time to bring in the big axe and cut away the root of all evils and not just the branches.
Arsenal should have never let Unai go..
BREAKING NEWS: Arteta signs new 2 years deal with arsenal. 😂
Ha ha ha ha ha .... !!!
I love watching AFTV as a Manchester United fan. It always brings joy to my heart. VIVA RONALLDOOOOO. 50 mil for Ben white who can’t even play 😂 what are you going to do with him. We got Varane for less than 40. Anyway Carry on
Arsenal are non descriptive and have been for a few years now,l like arsenal a great club but l feared for them when they employed arteta,when he was at our club,everton,he was the same, weak,we won zilch and he was our main man,he was in my opinion a cameo 15 good mins a game player!no way will he become a top manager as he is too nice/weak.
You all hypocrite and pathetic  you know long long long time the coach no good🙄
Norwich are more dangerous than Arsenal.
LoL it's only a game why do you have to be mad?
fairplay apaet from Abu the team is shur
I feel your pain Lee and it resonates. That was hard to listen to.
I was at the game as a city fan and that is the poorest Arsenal team I've ever seen. No fight, No clue, nothing. Embarrassing for you boys. But trust the process
Only red team witch I like .sorry Arsenal.
Where is DT?
it ws nothing more than  SHYAMBALLS!!! credit to manscape ha
Lee rants are legendary😂😂
120 mil in the bin, Inexperienced coach, bottom of the league, former captain granit still at the club and has an addiction to red cards. Saliba out on loan. What a mess...glad I support Man Utd!!
Who will want to come in...??
I told arsenal fans be careful what u wish for Wenger was getting top 4 consistently for 10+ years with players like bentner and chamakh and you lot were screaming for him to be out now look at you arsenal. AFTV we’re the ones saying wenger out and made it a trend to which most fans jumped on. The board and wenger saw this and did what they did so if u think about it AFTVs negativity is the reason for arsenals downfall ur fans are a laughing stock ur teams a laughing stock just a whole joke of a club from the outside to the inside and i love to see it hahahahaaha
Mistake upon mistake. Luiz, our best defender last season let go. Played chambers at cb. Saliba let go, plays kolasinac at cb. Holding given a new contract. Cedric barely played on loan, signs a permanent deal. What a shambles
it's the managers fault All by logic. emotional cats , go gossip. Sack the man.
Lee is the new DT
you know what isnt conference level. arsenal lmao
Lee is basically a kettle 😂
Least any Arsenal fan can do is Unfollow  Arsenal from Twitter Facebook Youtube  Instagram...any social media platform. More  views or hits Arsenal get on social media  even with these Joke of displays is condoning  Arsenal product also Premier League product  We are Jokera in this league for amusement of  other fans & pundits. As long you Arsenal fans  keep buying this crap, this will NEVER stop.  Because fans still keep on buying same old shlt
Lee used to have a full head of hair before the season started.
When is DT coming back?
0-💯 real quick‼️🤣
Want an example of what a shambles it truly is. The player who fell out with the fans, just fell short of giving them the finger, and was about to be sold, was then kept, given a new contract, and the captaincy. He then leads the young inexperienced players by example, by getting sent off stupidly (again) while his side are losing and desperate.
Where is the usual host ?
The timing of the question "does the manager have to go" priceless
100% wish all fans would accept enough is enough Arterta has had 4 transfer windows over £200 million to spend and over 60 games and there has been no improvement, See some idiots saying it's only 3 games, What deluded clowns these are. All of them get out
Were is DT?
To be fair missing Gabriel and White. Partey to help protect back 4 too.
So So easy to just point at the Manager??? how about looking at the so called World Class Players, starting with the overpaid, overrated Captain??
Lee judges gives off that Sunday league manager vibe
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The thing is, arsenal fans have to accept that their club is not what it used to be, its fallen behind in so many ways. i don't even think the manager leaving would help anything, the club is just not as big as fans think it is. many many millions needs to be spent on a whole new back 4
thank you. Hearing Arsenal fans rant is my therapy
Man sacrificed his birthday to watch Arsenal play City , Lee is a true Gooner.
😂😂😂😂 sponsored by manscape 😂😂😂😂 how appropriate Arsenal are balls lol
Not surprised by a 5-0, that’s where they are at
I would never mess with Lee. He can go 0 to 100 real quick
Arsenal need a new owner, manager and recruitment.   That is the only way things will change. Otherwise, they will get relegated
Deffo reckon fans should be refunded. We’re absolutely brilliant. The players have no shame
Reminds me of Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse .... "If Arteta comes round ere with his schoolboy defending tactics....."
Must be really hard being an Arsenal fan.
CM tiemuio Bakayo Julian Draxler AM Angel correa
Trust the process
CD Milenkovic and kounde        Saliba white
Where is TY when we lose . Where is TY interview . Where are you mate
Too much.
Classic saying "people are promoted to their level of incompetence" Arteta is a classic example of that.
How old are you Lee 🎂
Sold Gnabry Chamberlain and many amazing young players and buying New Strangers who don’t Fit Hard to Watch Past 5 seasons
The difference in the level of coaching-Chelsea and Arsenal both reduced to ten men in the first half. Chelsea shut out Liverpool at Anfield, Arsenal collapse like a house of cards at The Etihad. Goals win matches, but defences win titles. The defence HAS to be sorted.
As an outsider, I can't ignore the fact that you've got 5-6 starters out injured. Maybe firing the Manager, 3 games in, is a tough call. You're not getting top 4 anyway, might as well give Arteta 15 games. Conte should still be available in December if need be.
Lee is scary 😭😭😭
If Arsenal keep on going like this then I do think they'll be starring the Championship in the face
I can't wait for his reaction when they lose to Norwich 😂😂
a defence with Chambers, holding and kolasinac v man city you won't win many championship games with that set up never min prem games.
ArseNIL should watch and study how Chelsea performed when down to 10 men against a strong Liverpool side
Shelvey not happy with saints late equaliser
I wonder WhT will happen if Arsenal start doing well. This is pure Content. 100% 😂
You guys need to get this anger to the Board and protest till someone is fired or quits
Arsenal fans have become a parody of themselves! Getting what they deserve for hounding Arsene Wenger out the club!
Where is DT??? I miss his takes in situations like this!
This loon needs to get a life. Seriously.
Lee Judges is such an old school Arsenal supporter. You can see that it kills him
Voldemort: Gunderland
Arsenal fans even lost Arsenal day on may the 4th since Wenger left 😔
Give job for matasaka
I genuinely feel sorry for Lee. on his birthday of all days.
As a United fan, I totally understand the hurt. Arteta is a scam even watching from the outer space.
Arteta really needed to start off at Everton or Newcastle, not jump straight on at arsenal
Arsenal- the gift that keeps on giving 😂😂
WHERE IS DT
:-)
Happy birthday Lee
I'm still furious how Arteta got the job in the 1st place nothing against him 1) he's not the club legend such as Pep (success) Zizou (success) or Pirlo (flop) 2) he don't have the experience beforehand managing a club let alone a big club. If he is at Madrid, Barcelona or Chelsea he's already gone. Looks at their trophy haul.
Leno for Martinez  Holding for saliba  HE HAS TO BE SABBOTAGING ARSENAL SURELY
DT where
Poor guy. It was his birthday
Poor lee his jugular vein has took some stress today 🤪
The guy misunderstood when the fans where clapping the players and Arteta at the end of the match. Come on Lee the team was CLAP
Stop crying about all the time like you're a baby, Saliiiiba, Maaaari, Kolaaaasinac, Cooooonte. Go buy the club and let your rule live. Educate yourself about the game Lee, check how many teams City has hauled for 5 at home. They are at better stage in development, they buy £100M plus players etc. Not to be failed easily, but to win games especially at home when a team like Arsenal missing players or haven't got on their feet well come to town. Man up and face to what's coming.
7 points from the top boys
Feeling sad for Arsenal fans, I being Chelsea fan
I feel the same way as Lee. It's embarrassing. It's disheartening
If you can't defend you are in trouble
Why is Cecil always laughing??!
That manscape looks like it works pretty good
Get back GUENDOUZI and SALIBA.
LeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!! MR TEMPO!!!!
U arsenal fans deserve this. I’m happy this is happening. U guys deserve this. Go partey hard. Such a bad squad and team and even if u change coach u guys are still bad.
Get conte.
Wenger's last 7 years ⬇️ Emery's two seasons ⬇️ Arteta continue the same trend⬇️  All this tells me is the Owner is the main reason we are in this mess and we need to make him sell the club for all this to end. The investment of this club in the last 20 years is a joke compared to the teams at the top now. THE OWNER NEEDS TO GO⬇️
I don't watch EPL but it needs a salary cap.
Pep keeps bigging up MA no wonder come in agent MA bring back O’Leary and adams as duo managers
Imagine Arsenal go down….. no team is big enough to avoid the drop
Roy Keane: ARSENAL They are  good team good coach n  players  :p..... . Arsenal is too good... to be relegated.... lol.   Fans: no  great players and coaches want to come too good Arsenal what a shame too good, too late,  sucks mgmt and owners
Edu brings in his Brazilian mate William to arsenal. Look at the players at this football club. Chambers. Holding. Championship players.
The fans need to come together for our club, if we don't Arsenal football club will finish lower than 8 this season. The manager is not good enough.
SACK Arteta
Only manager going to Arsenal is big Sam 😂
If defending like that is good enough to be playing in the PL earning millions then surely I'm good enough to play for a Championship team or something😂
Arsene is free at the moment !!!!!!!
Lee "at this moment in toym"  Judges
COYS
Poor lee
You guys shouldn’t have let David Luiz go. He was your best defender
Lol, do you know what,? It’s going to get worse, much worse, because we are going to go top today. Come on you Spurs.
where is DT right now i need his anger to calm me down
I hope there’s a massive protest by arsenal fans at the Norwich game and somehow get arteta sacked
“Goondolan”
I love the fact you don't hear the word BRO once.
Happy birthday Gaffer !!!!!!!
Solution : The fans should protest by staying away from the stadium and not buying any merchandise for 3 months .
IF WE WERE A BIG CLUB WE WOULD HAVE SACKED ARTETA LAST SEASON AND HELPED A REAL MANAGER COME IN AND GET THE PLAYERS HE WANTED INSTEAD WE GET 3 LOSSES AND WE WILL LOSE AT NORWICH AS WELL CUZ THESE PLAYERS DONT RESPECT THIS MANAGER ENOUGH TO FIGHT FOR HIS REPUTATION.WE NEED TO FIRE ARTETA AFTER THE GAME BUT THEY'LL KEEP GIVING HIM CHANCES UNTIL HE RUNS THE TEAM DOWN IN THE GUTTER.WE HAVE TO ACCEPT WE WILL REMAIN A MIDTABLE CLUB WITH THIS MANAGER.
the club should refund the travelling fans
couldn't agree more. The match was just painful even for a neutral like me.
Even as a United fan, if Kolasinac can get into this team at CB ahead of Saliba I'd stop supporting Arsenal immediately
For me personally, if Arsenal lost against Norwich next week, then it is really Arteta out
Wenger Out
Arteta is a good manager The squad is just terrible
Happy birthday Lee. It's the least I can do right now,, but it's still more than our club.
As a wise man once said, “IT’S TIME TO GO!”
😂
The only signing needed is the charge of the manager. Arteta out out out out out out all day long
Remember when the Goonies were saying they will make a charge for top 4 because they are not in Europe, more like bottom 4 😂
Steven Gerrard  anyone !!!
I enjoy the rants more than the games
Imagine this arsenal have to face bayern
Arsenal are officially a mid table team
Why did arsenal set up to attack against city, when you know they're gonna thump a lot of goals in
Can't wait for the international break to be over. The battle for 20th is can't miss TV
Such a good point Lee, why was Mari not playing and Kolasinac playing, because Lukaku bullied him? Arteta doesn't realise that it is his fault why Mari was being bullied. Mari should have been playing in this game. Arteta is blaming the players and not taking any blame on himself. Bad tactics, bad system, bad selection, and a horrendous way of motivating the players, because all he is doing is killing the players self esteem.
Biggest football fan Chanel on YouTube and all we do is kill our players moral and kill the mood around the club. Time to shut up and support the team Lee.
Not a good birthday I went through the same on my birthday last year
"HE'S DONE IT AGAIN THAT ARTETA!" 😡😡😡
Arteta needs an international break to set up the team the right way.
벵거가 명장인 이유
전 시즌도 역대 최악이었는데 이걸 넘어서려한다
Gundogan isn't short lol
Lee's hands are absolutely massive!! Compare his mitts to the cat holding the mic. These are like 6'5" NBA baller hands.
The pain is real
If Wolves score today, Arsenal would be the only team in the Premier League yet to score...
0-5, 9% ball possession in the second half.  Guy with the mic: "It was a poor performance in my opinion"  No kidding.
Lee is the only good 1 left
Potentially having a couple of derbies next season against Millwall is something to look forward to.
I think Arteta initially thought you know what, we won't go full defensive and take the game on which in the early phase of the game, you could see clearly. The problem is, Arteta really thought that adding another CB to cover for Xhaka being the only defensive-ish midfielder would be enough to cover any counter or attack by City when we press up high..   Arteta imo got it completely wrong today. I could understand him thinking well no Partey and our RB is very sus so Lets not go full defensive and try to attack them but he severely underestimated City's quality in ball movement and finding space and OVERESTIMATED how good 3/5 of our defenders were. Mari should have definitely been in there and I think A back 5 with Lokonga and Xhaka would have made this a more competitive match. Everyone and their uncle knows that Xhaka CANNOT BE ON HIS OWN DEFENSIVELY IN MIDFIELD.. He needs someone next to him and I think Xhaka's frustration boiled over realising that its too much hes being asked to do. I think genuinely if Arteta felt Lokonga wasnt ready for this game, then Chambers should have been that Defensive midfield cover instead of opting for 5 at the back, at least then we have someone who can cover the midfield space.  Could not believe for the life of me how easily City strolled through our midfield and the space between our midfield and defenders was stuff you wouldn't even see in Sunday League games..
Good analysis
Arsenal fans have completely gone. They don’t know anything about football anymore. They think Martinelli is decent! Calling for Saliba and Mari to play!! What?! They should all be on loan at palace mate. Arsenal fans are spangled! Tragic
I’m not an Arsenal fan but most of the fans did say last week Pablo Mari was awful so Arteta would have got stick for putting him in the team again. Goes to show how bad Arsenal are and how bad their squad depth is.
Bring back Wenger 😂😂
Arteta Out NOW
"This show is brought to you by Manscape ... your balls will thank you."   I think you've taken a little too much off
Should have got Benitez when he was available.
Hahahaha this is my favourite. I wish I worked with this bloke
He's the English Ashok
Lee speaking the truth as usual - but credit to the Arsenal fans that went to the game and gave them support -they knew that were on a hiding to nothing - but were there to back the team.
Lee gearing up
I have a thought process on this whole mess at Arsenal, hear me out. Having Arteta right now might actually be a good thing for the long run. Yes, there will be many dire performances and sobering defeats, but the club and fans will learn some humility. I think since Wenger, we have demanded we be in the top 4, because that's what Wenger delivered annually for so long. Arsenal can't just get back into the top 4 with the current mentality.   I think the club needs to be broken down and re built, with a more pragmatic and workman-line approach. I can see the club losing top players and being knocked back. Hopefully the young players, fans and coach can all come together, work hard and get back into europe in years to come.
Happy Birthday to The Judge (Lee Judges)!  I'm sorry the results didn't go our way with this disgusting performance. Nonetheless, have a good one!
Its Lee Judges, wait for it...wait for it...wait for it, and there it is at 5.41 its the same deluded Arsenal fan giving us his weekly quote "This is Arsenal Football Club", other favourites can be heard on other videos with the quote "We are Arsenal Football Club", all from Lee Judges who along with all the rest of the Arsenal fans cannot see what is right in front of them!, a fallen club, a club that is a mid to lower league club, a prop up club and as predicted some years ago it will be a Championship club, the Arsenal fans will never accept it will happen, it may not do, this season or next but it will happen as they linger in the bottom half of the table becoming less and less financially stable as the players, manager and backroom staff fleece the club, but while these fans keep buying season tickets, merchandise etc the owner won't mind until!!..CRASH! it all comes down on them...couldn't happen to a nicer club!.
ARTETA OUT
“Be careful what you wish for”
Going Down going down Mikel Arteta, going down going down I say, going down going down Mikel Arteta, playing football the Arsenal way 🎵💩
Kroenkeout **** this fraudulence
Everybody is a manager now... Easy to judge AFTER a bad result and say things like "he should have done something differently" uhmmmm yeah, no sh*t genius, if the result was bad, he should have done something different. Plastic fans should have done something different too, instead of screaming "Wenger out" now that we see what that did to the club! Talk about that instead!
I loved this interview, Cecil Is the therapist and Lee is the patient….. Cecil let’s him blow off steam whilst staying cool as a cucumber.  Cecil, a bigger stage awaits you!!
I'm 5'4 and I'm not a midget😤
Does Arteta have a coaching license?
Lets the blame game begin
Where is DT?
laff a fookin minute with  these guys
Ty: it’s only the 3rd game. 20th is better than 21st.
‘Iv had enough’! : Arsenal fans!
Its time for the fans to come together for massive protest right infront of the Arsenal football club to remove Edu and Arteta as soon as possible before its too late.
He is dead right arteta is not good enough along with the the players
We spend 60 mio for a defender who get injured in first game. 25 mio for a keeper who is not even close to quality of  Emi Martinez, who we sold for 15 mio🤦‍♂️ . I realy like Tavares  and Lokonga, but the signings we needed were : Buendia(Cazorla style) , Bissouma(Viera style) and 2 Rbs. Young Max Aarons and older Ricardo Pereira. We needed  Saliba but we sent him on loan cos he not good enough? Realy?   Players who realy aint good : Kolasinac,Xhaka,Willian,Bellerin,Holding,Chambers,Cedric...  Im woried also about kids like Smith Rowe,Saka,Martinelli and Balagun, are they overhyped? Pepe, where was Pepe? 1 game he plays 1 not... this manager is an idiot im sory..
Congratulations Norwich you're one place up 😀
10 years ago on his birthday Arsenal lost 8-2 to United and 10years later City have scored them 5-0.....This guy has the worst birthday date for an Arsenal fan 🤣🤣
.
Lol, it was his Birthday 😷😀😅😂🤣🎂 COYS
Hi . You were supporting Arteta mate.
Arsenal are not a big club... 15years ago yeah but not no more...
Bring Wenger in...
Arsenal 😩
Also loaning out with an option to buy Mavropanos for €7 million euros what the hell is that about
Lol Lee raging Arsenal are finished next time we play Arsenal were gonna batter them 6-0 rewrite history
Like Ex says Arsenal  got put in a spliff BLUD again 😂😂
Set the team up to win, give the players a chance. Best team every week, in their correct positions.
So if we got an new coach/manager what are the chances Saliba or Mavropanos could return from on loan early? I don't know the in and outs of of the loan system. And to be fair haven't seen enough of either, but I do know whatever we need it's not on the pitch at the moment.
Sorry for my ignorance, but can somebody link ty's interview, I can't find it anywhere.
I would like to see the unedited version, stop censorting the LEE!
Lee is funny man 😂😂😂
im sorry, emery
Arteta is the worst Arsenal League Manager we have had. He has broken all the wrong records.  He should of gone from last season with Edu and Vinnie  He is making players worse and devaluing them.
they will beat norwich 5 0 then love the manager again
Lee is a real one.....
Lee is the best on aftv.
Even if arsenal sign cr7 messi mbappe combined still they will never win anything...i used to curse ozil for not performing at arsenal...but now i realized issue was with the club and manager not with him...with us( madrid) he was best..
who would go there apart from  big sam
robbie made another million
Wenger is available?
Gwarn Lee football is serious business
Ben White can’t even win headers and we paid £50 million for him
What happened to DT I don’t see him anymore
Best way to look at it is   Arsenal looked like Westbrom in the week  Outclassed with youth
Where is DT ?
*When's it gonna end Wobbie*
Fair play rant 🤣
Where has DT been?
I was trying to remain positive with the win mid week but the end of the day we just ain't cutting it when it comes to the big guns. We are a mid table team at best and for that I wasn't supprised
Arsenal fans walking out halfway through first half is everything 😂😂
I’m a Spurs fans and all my friends are Gooners but arteta is. Way out of his depth Arsenal are a big club you deserve a proper manager not some rookie on his first job learning as he goes along
2:30 was the moment Lee switched 🤣🤣🤣
Absolute GOLD!!! 😂
Hope you enjoy the rest of your birthday mate 🍻🍻🕺🇦🇺
“5’4 midgets doing this to us” 🤣
When I have a bad day this channel makes me feel better.
Who else noticed Leno time wasting to keep the score down?😉😆😅
Happy birthday Lee 🔥🔥🔥
Haha love this as a city fan, cheers.
Trust the process
The worse the better shld have be 10-0, the more we get humiliated the quicker the change . I was cheering for city they are a supreme team
Times like these I miss Claude and his wisdom really miss the voice of reason.
Man that 18% possession that was a joke
I thought Jean-Luc would’ve just blamed the Romulans.
Love arsenal the giift that keeps on giving.
I love Lee Judges 🤣
As a Spurs fan IMO, Lee is a realist! & speaks sense !👍🏻👊🏻
i cancelled my netflix and brit box accounts because the only comic relief i need is on you tube with arsenal fan television
Ty: "If Wembley fans hadn't booed Saka, Sancho and Rashford for the penalty misses we would have beaten City 6-5 today, unfortunately those boos counted against us and made all the difference."
Judges is a proper plastic fan. He's never at the away games any more. Shame on you kid
Total embarrassment, why keep signing second class players, Chelsea rejects and any player that no top team wants but arsenal do , £50 million for Ben white 😂😂 seriously it’s a joke, if arsenal finish in the top half this season it will be a result
We need Conte.
Don’t forget xhaka getting red card . Completely unnecessary from him
Only man with sense at AFTV
It's not just the coach. Arsenal are just a joke and it's karma for sacking Wenger and Emery. Good ebening!
Your club is a joke . Not a big club
Couldn’t agree more with what lee is saying. The very fact Arsenal Football Club decided to appoint a coach who had no managerial experience to come in and take over a club in disarray already is ridiculous we should be appointing a world class coach no other big club would accept this why should we sit back and just accept ourselves fall further and further away it’s not on !
Get Mavropanos back
Where is DT did you guys vote him out???
I’d love to know Lee Judges blood pressure reading
After 2:10, you can see Lee begin to fully express his anger😭😭
lets trust the process guys
A coach yeah  and a new 11  that team is shocking  god himself couldn't make them good
Thats the most ridiculous team selection ever  Smith rowe and odegaard against Norwich  Lokonga and elneny against city  How is xhaka captain never mind still here
No players would want to sign for a club bottom of the league.
TY- we lost the match because Thierry Henry did not start the Match 😂
happy birthday lee🥳
I’ve just bet Arsenal to win the Championship for next season 🤣😂😅
Haw come Nigal Winterburn wasn't playing
Talking of dt has he left aftv
As a city fan I do feel for him but he is funny he reminds me of dt
What is a “proper coach” gonna do with you’re current squad? Please enlighten me
Does somebody know why DT isn't there anymore?
And call Saliba back too! 🔥
Cecil is a good interviewer.
Bruh wtf is DT!!!!!!!!!!!!
Where's dt?
Incompetence level
But you beat wba under 23’s 6-0 the other night! Thought you had turned it around 😂
Gonderland
Lee cracks me up
Lee spot on
Mikel sometime I feel sorry for you because you have messed up everything and at the end your going to get disease because of the team, therefore in peace better live our club.
at least wenger secured the 4th table with lesser players
Feel bad for this fella. His birthday ruined
Chambers is almost as bad as Jenkinson
I think I just died at the footage of Ty shaving a Kiwi fruit. F*ck. My spleens is crushed from laughter.
Kurt zouma for 28m is a better signing 💀
Whose cut that interviewers hair hahahaahahaha and this channel has gone right down wheres DT?
Trollie troll troll 🤣
Ty , It was too sunny
I love this guy! 🤣🤣🤣🤣  Midjet winning a header and scores! Shambolic defending
lee should be the next manager of arsenal...straite up. hes the only one on this channel that doesnt act up for the camera and always talks sense. the only 1 i wanna hear from. put that man in for arteta
Has he resigned yet??
Lee’s anger shifts higher and higher like hears in a car 😂
I've had the shittiest 2021 but here comes Assnal to show me that tings can always be worse
Mikel even your boys are very weak I don't know whether they get enough training.
happy birthday lee
As a United fan I hope Lee had some sort of a decent birthday I know Arsenal losing didn’t make it better but I do feel sorry for you guys hope it gets better I like it when Arsenal are competitive it makes the Premier League more fun.
Lee is right
Johnny sins is a bit riled up. Jeez ....
“Are you Norwich in disguise” 🤣
Doesn't go to the games. Shock.
Aftv and manscaped are embarrassing
He got angry but he didn't grind his teeth.... Yoga sessions starting to pay off; Kudos to Lee.
".. We laughed through it because if we dnt laugh we gona get angry and cry" 🤣🤣🤣
Shambles joke and very embarrassing.   This club is now doomed.
Came here for Lee. He's the true fan.
Make a note folks- today, Lee says he’s fully done, Arteta out now. Let’s see what he says in 2 weeks after Norwich. Some of us have been Arteta out from day 1 and haven’t seen anything to change our minds.  Lee is right in saying Arteta’s out of his depth, he’s a boy lost.
A team lack of balls.... oh sponsored by Manscaped how fitting 😂
He's done it again  0 points
Big lol
My ribs maaan 😄😄😄
Lee speaks the truth
They need to sack everyone and put Lee, Robbie, DT, Turkish and Ty in charge > no more pissweak efforts
Arsenal TV is the gift that keeps giving 😂😂 highlight of every weekend
“Chambers been seen getting done by GUNDOLAND” i love lee ❤️🤙😂
Bring back Jack!!
I don't think even a new coach will fix this.  This Arsenal team is a mid-table team.
avrraaacadavraaaa....
Was waiting for that vein to pop 😂
The Al Pachino vibes in this one.
Well that escalated quickly
really love the dedication Lee has when he said he’s unlikely to go to any league games this season
This is copy and paste interview from the next game.
Gundogan's height gets less every AFTV video I watch. For the record he's 180cm (5'11)
Watched Olympic Marseille v Saint Etienne, both Saliba and Guendouzi played class. Saliba is composed, commanding in the air, fast, can beat the press and pass but not ready for us. I think Arteta needs to go for mismanaging players now.
Ty: "First five minutes we showed great promise for the future"
You're going down, You're going down, Arsene FC You're going down.
Lee...when you're right, you're right. EMMMMbarrassing!
Mrs Rose Robert and her method works like magic I keep earning single week with new strategy
AFTV makes the weekend so much better, Arsenal never fail to disappoint! 😅😅
Another aftv classic
📶 when you have to check if the volume is broken because the interview gets louder and louder without you touching the buttons 🗣
We've had 4 coaches it won't help if we just giving the next coach a bad owner and a bad squad and BSD morale team then that coach will fail owners before the coach you have to think if 4 coaches failed its the owner
Always a better player when you aren’t in the side…  Salibas never played a game for Arsenal and Lees probably never watched him play in the french league ever but he’s 100% the answer to the defensive problems apparently 😂
Gollum is pissed.
I don’t blame anyone at the club - I blame every fan that buys a single merch item, shirt, season a day ticket - it’s your fault for funding this show!
Holding looks like a solid choice at CB. 👀
This karma for Wenger is gonna go on a while yet by the looks of it 🤣
Aubameyang interviewing Jonjo Shelvey.
Where is Dt ?
🤣🤣🤣 “what you want some...???”
Lee and Azpilicueta had wildly different birthdays
Just to be clear, is Lee, Arteta out?
I love how Lee’s rants go through gears of intensity. True passion and feelings
Where's DT when we need him.
Rafa Benitez looks like prime Pamela Anderson to Arsenal fans now. xD
4:13 🤣
I'd get Eddie Howe in with Terry Connor as assistant manager
Before I go mad! Hate to see him get angry then!
Hmmmm what did you guys edit out at 3:20 tho?
Stooopid lmao
I hope arsenal get relegated.. horrible talking fans and it would be great to see more tears lmao
They should have thrown thr kitchen sink at Rafa Benitez in the summer.
"His done it again"
Ty reaction waiting room.
20 months of trusting the arteta process....over 10 years afc fan trustin the kronkeys process. Nuff said
lee should have been a character in goodfellas
You telling me this man ate that 8-2 on his birthday 😂😂😂
Norwich at home next, that should be an easy win right??
👨🏻‍🦲
Funny how after Arteta won the FA Cup the fans were saying Arteta will win them EPL UCL Euro and now Arteta out ! Haha.  Just admit it, the club is on a steep decline since 2004.
James went from seeing Italy win the euros to seeing Arsenal getting battered 3x in 3 matches. Went from heaven to hell in 1 month.
"Gunderland" 🤣
You mustn’t forget it’s been raining
Where is DT
aasno fubo clow, is a shampoozz !!!
Just imagine we predicted this defeat before the season kicked off. Arteta cannot be our manager for the next game. If he is, we deserve what we get.
Say what you want about him, Arteta will win the league this season. As the assistant manager of City. After he's been sacked by Arsenal and returned to the Etihad with his tail between his legs.
Can someone please inform me as to where DT is, i'm missing his reaction to the current situation. Has he left AFTV? He doesnt post on his own channel either
Fans walking out, what a joke of a club
He would be a great replacement for Harry Enfield as one of the angry men in the pub 😂😂
What I take from this video is: ‘it’s a shambles!’
It's gundagon not gundalan
I bet their praying to God to finish 8th this season
Haha love how some arsenal fans thought beating West Brom’s 3rd side with close to arsenals strongest side would solve all there problems. Back to reality need a change.
As a Chelsea fan i feel sad how bad have Arsenal fallen missed those years when Chelsea-Arsenal Rivarly was so heated back when arsenal was top 4 and Chelsea Arsenal were fighting for the title
De ja vu all over again. But it's not like Asenal Fan TV to want the manager changed.
The team has no cohesion no style of play its so sad you cant expect anything
Happy birthday lee sorry Arsenal ruined it for you today x
The Judge as spoken!
So when again will i watch this club display like the club we all fell in love with?
Ty: atleast we made a history not winning 3 matches of the start of the season without goal.
YALL HAVE TO TRUST THE PROCESS
I think Arteta needs to go out on loan. He's not ready for the first team.
Arsenal aren't the arsenal of old. Your a mid Table club at best.
"We have to back our manager! It's not Arteta's fault. It's not the board's fault. It's 'cause Arsenal fans aren't trusting the process!"   - Ty
Come on it was against city... atleast give arteta a some years....
Bring back Mustafi & Sokratis 😂😂😂
I miss DT 😢
But I’m sorry Mari had been shocking lately
Anyone under 5'4" watching this video... slowly starts to cry
Conte will sort these out, no nonsense policy. Get him in ASAP
Bottom of the league. Not a single goal
Wait until you see Ben White's aerial ability lol. One of the worse stats last few years
Cecil is a great interviewer
You all just stupid , dont you se arteta is bringing the value of the club down so Ek can get us cheap. The mans a hero Go Arteta
Shame
They take one if arsenal worst player in his days and make him a coach is the worst thing a club owner could ever done, he is clew less and fragile kinder garden coach, disgrace in arsenal team🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🤠
AFTV putting more pressure on Arteta 🤣🤣. Love this channel.- from a Chelsea fan..💙
I sure hope the Arsenal board watch these videos.
Spurs fan here!😀
Even Mavropanos is better than these clowns at the back.He scored for Stuttgart today as well.
Would ♥️ 2 hear that special needs manchild Ty defend tis performance  ..
Let's not lose all hope with Arteta just yet we don't even have our strongest squad available yet, give him till the end of the season trust the process thing will get better back the gaffer
The channel secretly loving the downfall of arsenal to generate views. Let's be honest. The only reason people watch this is too see some riled up cockneys whining
Gundaland 😂😂😂
I said when the team was named it was either a masterstroke or a resignation letter from Arteta. It was the resignation letter
What manager in their right mind would want to take on the challenge of improving this team. If Arteta leaves who comes in?
Robbie really gonna be a millionaire off arsenal 😂
I,LL never being a fan again untill arteta leave, I sware
To think that unai emery was sacked for finishing 5th and going 21games unbeaten is a jock. He also got the best from aubameyang. Arteta is clueless
Most of the players for today's still aren't good enough. Not problems on Arteta problems still we need more best extra players defence, midfielder and especially forward attcker player Let's talk honestly! £120m they spend for nothing.
When Lee hits 3rd gear......
woah woahhhh...midgets?? I understand your pain but slightly offended as a city fan
Finished fc
Who is this mug!? only Don Robbie is fit to talk to Lee Judges
You can have Steve Bruce if you want boys
Not an Arsenal fan, but Claude was the best to watch when things were going bandy.
Happy Birthday 🐐
Im a spurs fan and I just love to watch when arsenal loose!
Where is DT?
Gundoland😂
Buddy finna turn into the joker lmao
pop corn settings
WENGER OUT
Anybody think Xhaka takes "playing for the reds" the wrong way?
Let's talk about the process behind the player who for me was the worst player today, Cédric Soares. This guy came to us on loan, immediately got injured and on the back of not having played a game for us but being a Kia Joorabchian client was given a 4 year contract on huge wages. That imo perfectly highlights the level of incompetence and perhaps corruption we are talking about when it comes to Edu and Arteta. But there is no oversight whatsoever by the Board... Arteta kept the likes of Chambers and Holding around and offered others new deals on the basis of having a good attitude, i.e they're nice and won't challenge him. While far more talented players who challenge him in any way are exiled. That in 2021 is not good man management, it's the definition of not "managing" actually, how is he still in a job?  Tierney at this point is actually the biggest victim of the Arteta system and tactics. Those that play in front 4 are playing in a system that is dreadful for them but Tierney is actually being ruined by Arteta...
He isn’t going nowhere. Because we just invested 130 million on him.
Spurs is a better club
LOL 0-100 real quick I spat out my tea ffs funniest one yet🤣🤣🤣😎GGMU
Cheer up you miserable buggers, it could have been worse you could have drawn or won that would really  have ruined my weekend.🙂👍🍾🥂🍺
8 0 genuinely would not have flattered city
😂😂😂😂
Seattle Sounders, Tigres, Club America, and LAFC would beat Arsenal 🤣. Small Club
Like watching a kettle boil
How can it be so similar to the same issues under Emery?
The mental capitulation after the goal was pathetic the team selection was irrational the players need a hypnosis /subconscious mind therapy session surely this group of players are not that weak
Trust the process!
Arteta’s decisions don’t make any sense. He is trying to sabotage the club!
Can see arsenal relegated this season or fighting to stay in league
Spent 120m on nothing
Bring a new manager in and he's going to want £200,000,000 to put the team right but before he can fix it he'll have to get rid of all the high earners that nobody wants. Tough job for anyone.
5-0 loss on lee 50th birthday 🤣
Wheres the TY fan cam at!!
Happy Bday Lee i think u 50 yrs old noe eh? 5-0 it is happy bday lee
I wonder how many fans will show up for Norwich clash at Emirates.
Jesús😪🤣
where are all the deluded top 4 pratts now
Where's that little Goblin TY where all dying for a good laugh..
This interview is not different from the ARSE-CITY game, moment kept building 🤣
Just worked out that 'Arteta' means 'What time does the art arrive?'.
AND THATS THE BOTTOM LINE... COS LEE SAID SO 👌🏻
I know things aren't right at Arsenal when I'm not even slightly surprised or bothered about today's result...
Can't Arteta just leave without being sacked? At this time he should now know by himself that he's not a coach not even a school team coach. 😡😡
I am not used to hear people speaking with a British accenta and I find this funny
tomas the tank as a centre half lolololoolol god sake
Lee is manscaping Arteta.
No leaders no character no proper manager what a joke! What happened to our Arsenal.
Trust the Process..... Arteta needs to go back to putting the cones out..... The tactics have no direction, we are poor.... And Arteta needs to go TONIGHT
Only one who seems real to me
WENGER IN!!!
Lee has sincerely talked for all Arsenal fans.
5 foot 4 midgets lol :D
This is the ride you wanted, Wenger out remember
Arteta please go..... You are not a legend wanna destroy arsenal why?? Leave please..!!
Well said mate
Lee is a clown, Helen and Pippa are oke.
Grealish not good enough for Arsenal. He ran all over you. AGAIN. 🤣🤣🤣
AFTV is an absolute joke, along with the club they all support. Every video is a moan about defeat. Just stop making them, stop moaning. Your the biggest joke in the premier league. You all wanted wenger out, are you any better.......no!. Spurs fan.....your welcome 😂😂😂😂
Oh nice, they bottled Lee’s berth day
Today’s performance was sickening, the defence atrocious. Chambers and Cedric wouldn’t get into a championship side.
Lee, for us to have a good defence..... We will need 3 Ben Whites and 2 Salibas +an excellent Right back.....
Lee just says it as it is & he doesn’t try cover up the cracks & and that’s why I like his interviews . It’s true as well….the way Arsenal is being run is a complete joke & it’s things like when we spend 27m on saliba and his never been given a chance it’s crazy!
Arsenals player of the month is TY.
Lee brings better analysis... Give him a coaching role
I am beginning to think Arteta was sent over to destroy the club...just wanna investigate and find out who did send him???!!!
Ty: last time we played them in the league we conceded in the 1st minute, so it’s progress.
I can’t lie I’ve trusted Arteta and think he’s been unlucky but when Lee said “where is is Mari he’s your signing “ hit me hard I think Artet is making too much mistakes now
Leno likes opposition goals and is allergic to clean sheets.
No ty interview ?? Fuming
True words ‘not acceptable’
Coach wont make a difference. The rot is at the top
Whoever blame player is stupid.arsenal problem is their tactical not player.
Release the uncut version. 3:20 theres a scene transition and obviously AFTV are censoring Lee to make him sound as positive as possible.
says the guy wearing an arsenal jersey..lol kronkie is like..thank u for ur business ..lol keep spending ..come again u lot
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA
'GundoLAN'
Who is the plank that said he will slap chambers this guy needs to be sacked
I've had enough FC
LOOOOL A GROWN MAN CRYING HAHA
Where's the TY interview?
TY:  "It's not to bad, depending on how you look at the table, we are top if you look upside down"
Attention seeker this guy
Lee is like a Diesel engine. Needs time warming up 😂😂
TOTALLY AGREE WITH EVERYTHING LEE IS SAYING
Stupid Gooners 🤣 They should have to protest for the proper owner first before sacking manager after manager ; rather they're still supporting the culprit+dumb owner and want a top coach 😂
Bring back Mavropanos before it's too late.
Where's DT?
Jesus where is DT ??
this is so funny
Where's DT
Wheres that prat DT
Arteta  is incompetent  and  a  waste
We are so done, we reached new lows this afternoon 🤠🤣🤦🏼‍♂️
CAREEEFREE - we didn't even lose at Liverpool today vs the Refs annnnnd down to 10 men....all our players given cards but Fabinho/Van Dijkk
Where is your Mask TY and Lee!!...
Rudi Garcia is available, he made lille a big team in france, bought Marseille and Lyon back to champions league while there, He can rebuild us. He Also did well at Roma the first two years even tho it ended weirdly. Not gonna win us the league but he is very good with transfer business and can rebuilding the team. Don't think we will get conte, now that he missed the chance to make his own transfers this summer.
AFTV isnt the same without dt and troopz
You man all had an experienced manager- and rather than get behind him, you all took the piss out of how he said “good evening!” I’d like to see how all you wastemanz would say “good evening” in Spanish! I bet you’d sound more bait than Emery sayin it in English! Joke fans, banter club!
I'm 5ft 4... Am I a midget... 👀
this defeat hurt's not for the resulta the real reasson it's the lack of engagagement don't show awareness not changeof mentallity lose the gain iam saddest so mutch Angel because iblove our canyon but i can't resignme a mediocer football hughs and regrets from the gooners and goonerettes from Bolivia La Paz we re the 🔥Arsenal ⚽️🥊🔥
Arteta  can't  coach the  boys  .He  hasn't  got a vision for the club. SACK  Arteta  NOW
Hello
They ask me what I do and what I do it for.  How I come up with this shii up in the studio.  All I want for my birthday is a slap on my face.  All I want for my birthday is a slap on my face.  Lee Judges rendition of 2 Chainz Birthday song
Happy birthday Lee Judges.  I am a Man United fan but I can see the passion you have for this club.
Lol why’s there’s cuts in this
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 As a Man United Fan this is so wonderful.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😆🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝
Arteta's mission is to get Arsenal football club relegated
Time to bring in Big Sam to keep the ship afloat.
Lee should be arsenal's manager. City also made arsenal look bad today.
Love listening to the angry Voldemort 🤣🤣
Maybe Arsenal might need that Manscaped so that the balls love them.
"laughing so that we don't cry" sums it all up.
That tym we used to stick on tv with tiktak now iz pure humiliation
arteta in PLAYERS OUT
watching this in 1.75x speed is funny lmao
Man City have got Gundalan, Arsenal buy theirs from Matalan.
I think the team was set up well today. Once again, it was individual incompetence that let us down. Arteta is indeed to blame for player selection, but I don't see what other options he really has. Any manager in his position would be having a sh*tty time. Arsenal is a bottom table club with bottom table players and a mid table manager
We need to give chambers and holding same treatment as sokratis and mustafi, we have given these crap players for way too long, shoulda snapped middlesboroughs arm off for 20 mill for chambers 5 years ago, but no majority of our deluded fans and club rated him, we deserve what we are getting
Arsenal set to default settings yet again by Man City 😂😭
Happy Bday Lee ! 🔴⚪️❤️
Quality rant Kwa-lity!
Robbie in court today...for walking the streets naked. Public disorder act.
Sad it happened on his birthday Lol. Same old arsenal.
Anyone else found it funny having Ty look so sad while shaving what seemed to be a potato 😅
He’s like a kettle
Kola is still here while saliba is on loan😩, no proper rb the team is sinking and all arteta does is to tell us about the massive support he has from the board. Played 3 amf still we had just one shot on target, very disappointing result.
You expect Arteta to voluntarily leave? Lol. Don't you trust the process anymore gooberz?
That anger reminds me of the smell of pies and terraces, proper fan, not happy, can't blame him. West Brom's defense are more porous than bath pumice so really the win is not an indication of any change and the prem top teams sadly mean hard matches. See how they do against Norwich I guess.
Can see the veins on his head 😂😂😂😂😂
Where is DT or troopz
Give Xhaxa  a new deal 🤣🤣🤣
I love arsenal's pain.
I had to pay a subscription service to watch that trash from the U.S. Arteta has no answers. Get him out.
North Bank
Arteta is the worst manager ever, even lampard is better than him in Chelsea
That guy Gundaland is class
Lee its been bad day for us,so nice that we were born on the same day n supporting this trash together
Am a Manu fan but like this channel.. where DT?
Arteta IN!
Lee so frustrated calls gundogan = Gundalan
High 5 everybody!
Lee stuttering mid-rant will always make your day😂
Has any one also noticed that both Lee and Turkish both said,  Arsene's plays . Scripted 🤣🤣🤣
I love watching this channel 🤣🤣🤣
It’s like watching a kettle boil ♨️
This channel the last few years has been absolute gold. 10/10.
Sambi has looked quality as has Tavares, please someone tell me why those 2 weren't started as there the future and there the signings AND can we get news on Pepe at all ffs, and the red was written all over this game.... I called it 30 kins before kick off and called who would get it and all..... were a laughing stock.... I am blown away by the selection
😭😂😭🤣
Why’s he so upset, it’s just a game?
Lee calling Arsenal's defending Conference (National League) level. All National League team managers are now going to rollock their defenders for only being 'Arsenal level' defenders.
5ft4 midgets 🤣🤣🤣🤣😩😩
This is how I argue with my wife. Start easy and build into it lol
All these players that you guys are buying and have bought, like Mari and ben white I never even heard of them. Dont know where they come from anyway. You guys have fallen to terrible standards. Shame.
RECALL SALIBA
Lee sounds like a P.E teacher that smells of cigarettes
Cant believe how arteta still has a job its unfathomable literally wtf i feel like banging my head on a brickwall
CLUB FOR CLOWNS Voldermort for caretaker boss
New manager???? Who wants to come to Arsenal and manage this club.  Seriously, these players don’t deserve to play in the premier league.
Arsenal needs a seasoned manager to bring in Precast plans and execute them...with Arteta Arsenal is in freefall. Only way is 👎
When you realize the Kronkes work for Don Robbie’s views.
If the club backed uni Emery like Arteta we would have decent team.
HaPpY bIRtDaY to you Lee. The only positive today is your birthday.
Ty: According to the multiverse theory, there is a universe where we demolished City. Well done, lads!!!
Arteta tapping Xhaha when walking off after his red card was the worst part about the whole game. Absolutely disgraceful example being set by the manager. He should be sacked for that behaviour alone
I know I am funding arsenal transfers because I am watching aftv but  I lov watching these vids it makes me laugh 🤣
0:15 Happy Birthday Lee Judges. Same birthday as my mum !! :-D
What's happened to DT?
The vain comes out, the truth follows 😂
Big up Lee!
Voldemort all sad 😂😂😂😂
Lord Voldemort has spoken
Happy birthday Lee🎂🥳🥳
Ty: I blame the ref, the officials are against us Robbie, just like the tackle on Dennis Bergkamp in 2004!  Its a conspiracy against us Robbie.
Very sorry mr Lee 😢.  Ma with u. Arsenal fun from ug🇺🇬
Ooooo the rage!!!!!
I'm a United fan and I'm old enough to have watched the Arsenal invincibles and thinking "how the hell is anyone going to beat Arsenal?". What the fudge has happened to Arsenal. I can't even laugh at them anymore. It's just sad....
Spot on Lee!
Arsenal we get bullied in defence or teams just play through us!!
Mari is piss poor
Mad to think a big percentage of arsenal fans were calling for wengers head.
They were surely Manscaped at Etihad
AFTV, the ever-giving gift that keeps on giving
My heads spinning with the speed of Lee's head rotating.
Hihi, Chambers, Holding and Kolasinac. That's a Championship back three.
your team is crap and the invincibles are not coming back
Mid table club hahahahaha
We're at least 3 or 4 seasons behind the top 4/5 teams, Arteta spent 130 odd mil on talented youngsters for depth. None of them are game changers or stars. Even if we spent 500 mil we would still not be in the top 4. Arsenal is a project, we're barely a top 10 side anymore. Talk of Conte coming in is hilarious. Tomorrow's press conference with Arteta  " Good Mourning "
cant wait for ty to still waffle about giving him 10 games
Y’all have been blaming the couch for years
Has to go. Awful football no shots on target again
When’s it gonna end robbie ???
Lee Judges has become the MVP of AFTV
Its better to go out there into the stadium and shout Arteta out instead of Crying here in AFTV, clowns
Lee’s build up is better than Arsenal’s
Coach is the problem giving Xhaka a contract,now he plays kolasinic,y is chambers still playn for arsenal upto now ,loaning Saliba , Guendozzi, Torreira n yet they r better than the ones who are there playing shame on u Arteta u have ruined our club u n Edu poor n shambolic club
Hahahaha love seeing him unhappy. Kane says hi hahahaha
Whoever plays you want effort .to watch a team stand off and give up is shocking .arsenal can't defend so if i was the manager I'd use a high press get in there faces and Try .have a go its shocking if you can't defend then just have ago ffs
Saliba and Mavropanos out on loan, 4-0 win for nice this weekend and a goal for mavropanos in the bundesliga as well says it all about the defensive decision making lol
Happy bday Lee sorry they let u down on your day. Great video as always🙌🏿👌🏾
ARTETA OUT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They have allowed 9 goals in 3 games, that's appalling and shows that Arteta is not the man to manage this team.
Trust the process guys
Time for Big Sam to step in. Don't leave it too late like W Brom.
What a bday present 💝
Happy birthday
Who's upset Lee?
Arsenal are being sold to a Nigerian billionaire
weres ty interview
Where tf is Robbie man. This other guy doesn’t do them like Robbie
lol
Stop going to the games
If only Angry Rantman was a gunner, the world gonna explode
We'll be processed to championship (club that tried to force super league) this is their "trust the process" With each day my respect for Roman and his Chelsea team is growing. With him we would have new manager even today. Arteta would be out before post match conference started today.
Arteta's non negotiables: Auba/ Laca stop scoring. FIFA manager.
Fans like Lee don’t deserve what their club puts them through, Troopz and DT on the other hand….
Its pointless to get rid of the manager, unless you get rid of the owner aswell.
That vein in his head is scarily getting bigger
Saliba❤
Big sign
5 more players the problem is not a coach Believe me this team want 5or 8pig players
Ben White is nowhere near good enough for a champions League grade team, he's at a mid table club now and that's his level
as a neutral this arsenal collapse isnt even funny anymore, its just sad really that proud fans like lee are having to deal with this sort of stuff, and Lee is spot on in his assesment as well btw
Lee , you faced the CL finalists and winners in the first 3 games. Calm yourself down. After this, Arsenal are going on a winning run.
Who are these people that are still travelling the length of the country in support of this shambles? Do they all have MUG written on their foreheads or are they just living in cloud Cuckoo land?
AUBA WASN'T WALKING OFF TODAY WITH THE MATCHBALL ACTING THE BIG I AM 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The new Claude
Ok from what i was watching Chambers manned his position, but Cedric who i would expect to be covering his blind side let the man run in behind Chambers. I blame Cedric for that goal. I would put Chambers and Holding in there before Ben White all day that how poor our defense is 50 mil and the man let the ball drop at his feet in his own penalty area for the man to score. If Gundoan beat Chambers to the ball i would agree with Lee and his criticism but that wa snot the case. Cedric and Kolasnic are escaping a huge amount of criticism. How the Latter is starting ahead of Niles is beyond me.
We just need good experience coaching, arteta is okay but just not for arsenal now this time
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When the season started, I was Arteta in, but after the Brentford game, I changed my mind. It looks like the players do not trust Arteta, and vice-versa.  The only reasonable decision to be made at Arsenal Football club is to fire the Manager.
It is clear that Arteta is trying to hide his signings by not playing them.
Give Arteta the tools to do the job ffs.
where is dt?
7:49 “Oolegaard”
We need to say sorry to Arsene Wenger else this wont stop
Arteta is guilty of deceit and needs to first and foremost go on his knees and apologise to the fans
Oh how the mighty have fallen.
gundoLan
Haha typical arsenal fans blaming the coach. No coach can save this team
Where’s dt?
Lee, you need to watch the last few games that Saliba has played, he is no better the Chambers with aerial defense.
We want more players
Crazy to see how far Arsenal have fallen
Wenger out!!!  Hahah
Same mistakes from the same players that clearly can't be coched from 3 managers
My birthday too! Happy bday Lee
Man I so love the looks on arsenal fans oh the humiliation oh the embarrassment oh the rage and disgusted feeling 😂 😂 😂 OMG I love it. I love it when people loose their sht because they sucks especially arsenal fans 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 OMG.. I'm Dying. I know it's wrong to hate and throw shades but it's arsenal 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
Arsenal problem is not coach
cheer up you have us Norwich next .
ngus 79 Love the fact that as Spurs fan I get to watch Arsenal fans eat themselves alive while also getting the odd discount on products. AFTV - the gift that now literally keeps on giving.
Arteta isn’t rebuilding. He’s dismantling.  He has such a love for Pep that he has actually engineered the fall of Arsenal so he can please Pep and say “I have shown you my love has no bounds! I have destroyed an entire British footballing establishment for your pleasure! Love me, Master!”
Unless we say enough is enough, the agony keeps torturing us forever! What's this?! Is this the team we are building?! Where is the gut? Where is the motivation? Where is the pride?!  Just bring in Conte! You will see the difference. I can see that no problem with the players! The coach fails to blend the right ingredient. We have sufficient squad that can play for the top 4! But we have no tactically rich experienced coach.
big sam time at the emirates 🤣
You entitled mugs have contributed to this with your relentless negativity. Pathetic 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lee the word you were searching for is ........... cojones
Please consider selling or stop you tubing now 😂 😂 😂 because your team is trash
Where's DT
Thank you man that’s what I agree on
Mari is rubbish btw
Where the Arteta in muggs?? I know they still here what you say now?? What?? Jokers!
Worst ting is that I'd have wake up like 6am in the morning to see this performance its killing me.
On a more unserious note, I've never heard a more British person than Lee.
Look at Chelsea defending with 10 men against Liverpool woth a point gained.  Why can't the gunners do that against Man City? City are beatable look at Spurs !!!!!! My god no improvement from Mikeal Arteta wow amazed still has a job
Wenger finished 6th : "Wenger Out" Emery finished 5th : "Emery Out" Arteta currently at 20th : "Trust the process"
Lee I agree with everything you said. It's an absolute shambles there at arsenal
Where's Mr. DT?
2:06 Gundaland 😭😭😭
My god how beautiful it is to see arsenal fans these days. Good to see arsenal where they should be:)
This is gonna be good.
ARTETA IS CLUELESS !!!  Players don't wanna play for him , they did it with emery , when the players want the manager gone they will keep losing til he is gone .
Have arsenal ever thought it's their players ....
4:34.. damn I am a midget.
Not Conference level, Incompetence level. Like it.
As soon as city scored 3 arsenal had no way of comming back
Humiliation 😡
Arteta is part of the issue. KROENKE is the problem. Arsenal have not been competitive for over a decade.
they need to get players from Ajax.
Genuine question, who would you Arsenal fans have as a coach? With the state of Arsenal atm who would wanna coach this team?
Wenger in!
Time for this make a wish program: Ex-player to football club manager project to end!!!  First Lampard, then Pirlo, next Arteta? Ole I'm looking at you too, bcuz your'e in a worst position now that you have CR7 returning.
The Blame keeps Goin on Arteta but Wth Can the next Coach do different?!?  The players in the Squad Suck!!?? The Center Backs don’t even Compete! How can City’s Short ass Forwards be winning those Headers against them!  Aside from Tierney, Saka, and Smith Rowe! Aúna doesn’t  even try to defend! Or come down to get the ball maybe he picks one or two players differently but Arsenal honestly needs a complete overhaul.. Neither Conte or Zidane are goin to want to come in with that squad
After a shortlived bliss, Arsenal back to reality!
Aftv host the picture of your looking down face carry the negative energy .
"It's Arsenal" As if Arsenal was ever a great club🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Anyone here watched The Fast Show? It's Michael Payne.
Happy birthday Lee! Just turned 16 and this is what Arsenal have done to him!
Tyrian Lannister fancies scoring a header against us
Arteta is not going anywhere. I want him to stay!!!
I'm not arsenal fan. And I don't want to throw any bad word here. But this vid make me laugh so damn hard. I think I laugh for the first time in 5 years.  I think arsenal is a great team. Just like the guy said, the team need stronger defence.
Ty; Our fans celebrating like its a party tricked the players into thinking they were doing the right thing and that they should carry on!
Arsenal is history time to accept and move on.
Ty: Arteta is getting us to Championship football to win the league.
Conte in 🇮🇹
It sounds like you lot aren’t angry, just disappointed.
It is crazy that he doesn't want play Saliba and plays those guys.
Disagree with Lee, City wasn't clinical enough and didn't need to try hard to breakdown the defense.
Chambers has been a steal for arsenal played so many years might end up being an arsenal legend
Have to laugh at  Lee,he sits there looking at his phone most of the game,how can he comment on the game.
Arsenalfan lives matter ✊🏿
Big winner today is Manscape
Where’s DT?
Why can’t Arteta manage Saliba? That boy should be playing for Arsenal. Not Marcelle.
Leave the Emirates empty...... How is it possible to play worse season after season? ahhh yesssss Arteta is a manager
Respect to these guys Aftv painful but professional to come on. but as far as Arteta goes those new signings need an experienced manager. I mean at least have a water tight defence even if you don't score wheres good old George Graham
The worst thing is i bet even Kolasniac was shocked he was starting
Happy Bday Lee, I am a United fan we just got back CR7 so  I want to lend you some of my happiness.
Since 2015 Arsenal have decided to go in a run to get relegated. And they are succeding at it. I would choose the other way around, but the important thing is to set goals and get them, no matter what. Keep fighting for that unusual decision, Arsenal. Arteta is the right man for the job.
You guys have been saying that since he was ur man. As long u lot don't get relegated.. I'm sure you will be fine in EPL. Lmao
Freddie Ljungberg
Lee is right... If ur going to choose a player ur desperately trying to get out to start over a player u bought last season then u don't know wat ur doing
Wenger in
Ty: we was trying to man Mark Harry kane for 60 minutes before we realised they hadn't signed him
No more arsenal, They are worst club in EPL, Shame on you guys, LOSERS
😂😂losers
Arteta isn't good enough to coach at ANY level. I'm so disgusted with arsenal. After 25 years of watching I just can't do it anymore.
The definition of 0 to 100 ....lee judges
5'4 midgets got him good
I wish this club I love with all my heart gets relegated,  so whoever's buying it get it at a better prize, coz they would have a hell of a job rebuilding it.
Same old arsenal.. some says after West Brom game..they had a a chance against Man City... really..!!!🤣🤣
Only AFTV is happy from all this. 🤑
At least you beat WBA U12s. 🥳
Cecil wanted to burst out laughing when he said 5ft 4 midgets 😂😂😂
You had an experienced manager but chose to insult him time and time again until he was gone. Yall never learn do you lol
we need a good old fashioned manager, go get sean dyche.
Well said Lee.  On the other note heard Lee saing about fans taking photos at the game.  To that I want to say that us, international fans who wasn't lucky enough  to be born in England, this game or any other for that matter can be the only time they see Arsenal play in person . I'm one of them,  only got to see opening game against city three years ago. IMO it's not right to call people out like that
Arteta is a good manager with poor players. Arsenals back 3 could easily play for a bottom 3 club. Dreadful recruitment in the past + new recruits being injured in the present have damaged arsenal badly.
I never want to see xhaka play for this club again he's reckless and can't pass forward
damn, even with this side, man utd will still find a way to give points to arsenal 😭😭😭😭 and this is coming from a utd fan
Arsenal have been in doldrums ever since kronke became owner Never invested in the squad  Bought players not fit for premiership Even tottenham has progressed more than arsenal  Until kronke there arsenal will never succeed
...Not Good Enough to be the Arsenal manager".............FACTS!
why isnt Nuno tavares playing? trust me, he gonna be very good, the only reason he didnt play at benfica was cause of grimaldo which is basically a number 10 playing left wing back
I've had enough of this manager he's clearly way out of his depth definitely not the man to take us forward 🤨
Get Pulis and Shawcross in
You Freddie Crouger looking Spa
It's not just arteta. The board needs to go NOW.
Arsenal is so bad worst team in London, and the premier league 😂😂😂
This bunch said that Arteta is far better than Ole
Arteta isn't a coach - he is a manager.
You get out of the club your an embarrassment
I am ready for the main course, bring me Ty's interview!
What happened to DT?
Arsenal is comedy and the fans are absolute clowns
Ty after Arsenal get relegated: Ya know, only 3 teams are able to get into the championship. That’s quite an achievement!
DONT SACK ARTETA. Trust the process please! Watching Arsenal get battered every weekend is my main source of joy
Use are a funking laugh 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Arteta out ASAP... birthday wishes Lee this could come true...
MANSCAPED over Lee's Head is a distraction
We got an unofficial 10-0. Man City stopped playing after 15 minutes and scored 3 goals because they didn't want it to be obvious.
Yall were complaining so much when you were finishing 4th with wenger and promoted wenger out. You never know what you have till its gone. Even if arsenal finished 2nd yall would be bitching and moaning about it
Where is the obese one?
good to see eder militao doing well on aftv
I’ve watched and supported this club for 33 years , this is the worst arsenal team I’ve ever seen and I feel hurt and humiliated by what I’m seeing the whole club from top to bottom is in complete disarray.
Bring Ozil back... or same quality player
Wenger out
Lee is the heart, soul and voice of Arsenal fan’s.
Chelsea were more organized with 10 men than Arsenal with 11. Trust what process.
New coach?  Your whole squad is build of dead wood.
No goal of the month for Arsenal 🤣🤣🤣
Where has DT gone?
Do AFTV know 90% of the views are fans of other clubs coming to laugh at Arsenal whenever they lose?
I clap my team off the pitch no matter what I’m so glad you lot don’t go to games anymore!! nice studio! It’s the best place for you lot
ty aftv this is gold content
Don't worry guys its only -9goals.. Lee after everygame. "i have had enough 😂😂😂😂  COYG🔴⚪️
Gundolan 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The fans that travelled there are part of the problem...... the gullible fools!! ARTETA OUT!
Wenger out 😂
5:4' midgets bully central defenders
Whats happened to DT it aint the same without him ranting
It's all OK saying get a new manager in but who in their right mind would go to Arsenal?  Certainly not anybody with any pedigree would even consider it the state they are currently in. Hence why you find yourself with Arteta in the first place
Big up our woman’s team tho
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tomorrow Tottenham could go top and we are bottom. this is totally unacceptable. any Arsenal manager should resign on the spot or be sacked.
Where is DT?
It’s so clear Arteta needs sacking and Edu
There was a manager he's now at Everton.
Sooner or later he is gotta go, better he goes now and save us from more embarrassment
Where's dt?
Arsenal give arteta 2 more yrs contract please
Happy birthday to the legend LEE JUDGES
Only 3 game ?
I dont care if we lose if we fight and go down swinging, this team is weak and time is up for Arteta. I would genuinely rather have Big Sam as manager, at least he knows his formation and tactics which arteta clearly doesnt.
Where is DT ?
Completely agree with every word and every emotion in this video
Robbie has balls??? Lmao 😂😂😂😂 . He still support arteta, maybe he likes his balls. 😉
Arsenal are the worst defending team, its been like this for a decade. 7 min in!!!! Smith Rowe is standing 10 yards from the Man city player dancing back and forth and he stays 10 yards away, instead of doubling and blocking the cross. Block the cross!!! Block the shots!!!! It takes effort and thats all, it isnt rocket science, Arsenal defending is the worst!
If this was Wenger losing we would see Wenger out across Twitter Facebook TikTok whatsapp and any other social media platform that can be seen by people around the world.... It's been three years and we can't even enter UEFA Europa league and now we are on our way to second division what a great club and "supporter"
I’m sure Arteta will do his usual ‘We played well and didn’t deserve to lose’ crap he always comes out with. He’s an arrogant manager with nothing to be arrogant about.
They did that WITHOUT De Bruyne.
Why you cutting the video for 😤
have never in my life time seen Arsenal play like dis even when we lost again man utd 8-2 they Still didn’t play like dis 😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮bloody disappointed ☹️!!
😅 football isnt everything we got aubameyang
Where is DT?
My man's just called me a midget
Ty : Klopp lost 5-0 at the Etihad in his 3rd season
I've been following AFTV for quite some time now and I find that we have a penchant for doom or gloom, boom or bust reactions; even with the more seasoned supporters. Sacking the mgr is not the solution, getting the right players in is the key.  We need a midfield destroyer and it's glaring. There is no protection for the defense.  Let's calm down and not knee jerk react.
NUFINK.
Cheer up at least you beat west Bromwich's reserve side 6.0 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Arsenal just got manscaped by man city
Beat West Brom 6:0, Arsenal is a championship team
😅😅😅
That’s down to players at least 11/12 must go, bang average
All you people who renewed their season tickets & bought replica shirts your getting what you deserve.
Captain spock from the starship enterprise having a frenzy lol..
Ben White doesn't do it either in the air haha, the gift that keeps on giving. absolutely love it.
His anger makes me laugh out really loud... Wat too funny... And felt sorry for him . hahah
Might have been an idea to have given the game a miss seeing as it’s his birthday. As soon as Arsenal went 1-0 down, I thought this is going to be messy for Arsenal. I’m surprised that city stopped at 5 goals. They could have scored 8 easily. I’m not an Arsenal fan but it’s sad to see a great club like them reduced to this.
ARTETA OUT!!!!!
Ty at least your team are breaking all records keep it up 👍
Time to support my local team leyton orient IM OUT!
The midfield is weak a good midfield will take the pressure off the defence
Whose here for the laughs 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ben white in the air is weak the options aren’t there, it’s simple Arteta’s clueless, this one isn’t about losing but afc fans need to wake up we have been getting worse since wenger left because we didn’t get the right man for the job.
Get me out of this misery💔💔💔💔
My man Lee. Your day has been ruined by Arteta 😥
"Because it was a poor performance in my opinion" cutting edge comments by Cecil yet again.
There is a process, but there is no progress lol 😆😅
We are now truly seeing how Wenger overachieved since the Stadium construction.  Arteta looks like he will end up being a good manager but only for a club where they already have senior players with an established work ethic and hunger to achieve.   That's not Arsenal right now!  I believe that Arteta could well go on to be a really good manager, but there have been too many poor performances where the senior players were not held to account for their lack of a fight/capitulation and I don't get the sense that they are very concerned about letting the manager down.  There is still a lot of talent at Arsenal but the senior players aren't showing up and they clearly won't give there all to a Manager that won't hold their feet to the Fire.  They need someone with a clear plan, who's  prepared to give them the kick up the backside they so badly need and a manager who won't tolerate poor performances without going full Ferguson boot to Beckham and all (Yeah I'm an Arsenal fan and I referenced Ferguson, but I truly believe this team left the Etihad without the portable fan treatment, let alone the full hairdryer).   We need manager who is capable of getting results with a squad that is not as good individually as the teams at the top of the league they are competing against (competing with in relation to historical precedent, and size of the club, not form over the last few years) .   A manager that has a proven ability to handle talented problem players (Guendouzi, most of the senior players right now, Bellerín, maybe Aouar....)  I think *Diego Simeone* fits the bill, and this is one Arsenal fan who believes he's the best thing that could happen to the Club right now and might just be available in the present climate.
Cristiano Ronaldo Back where he belongs. 👹💯📍🐐🔥👑⭐♥️GLORY GLORY MAN UNITEDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!
Before I get angry 😂
No use of getting mad anymore.. it is gettin boring now
You only had to blow the bloody doors off
Where is dt?
Arteta has to go, we can not wait any more arteta can’t fixed the Arsenal he is make Arsenal worse,😡😡😡😡👎👎👎👎👎
As long as we using those poor defenders then we will lose always....Arteta should just go ....
Man City Manscaped Arsenal 😁😁😁😁😁
Big up to the fans who walk out earlier, if all the fans had walked out, that would be statement 🤔
Arteta is more arrogant the wenger
Even Artetas lawyer doesnt show Up any more
No! Let us get this clear, it is not so much about Arteta but the structure at Arsenal. Even if Conte comes in and the useless structure is not changed nothing will improve. Hasn't Emery gone on to win the Europa with Villareal after his sacking at Arsenal. Most of the players right now are useless and overpaid. They might not even be good enough for the Championship. Cedric, Chambers, Kolasanic and Holding were disgraceful because they are just not good enough. Why blame Arteta? Arsenal is a rich top club. Why not go for the best players? Wasn't it silly when they got Luiz and Willian when they had passed their peak. Food for thought: if Usmanov had been calling the shots at Arsenal would it ever have been this bad? We all know what happened.
How I wish I was listening to Claude and DT for comic relief 😂
It burns, doesn’t it? You guys continuously humiliated Arsene Wenger.  Now look at you. Enjoy the fall to the bottomless pit. 😆😆😆
in 2004 Arsenal with 0 lose. Arteta is going for 0 win in a season. Remarkable manager hats of.
😂😂😂 dry your eyes baldy.
Lee's build up is far far better than Arsenal's build up play.
Araenal fans they they can win Chelsea & City 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Arsenal’s opening game of 2022-23 season will be away to Birmingham City!
Man City fans are singing the aftv theme song “we love you Arsenal we love you” banter FC and and the C stands for Central 🤣😂
Had enough? Get a proper coach in? People can’t see it but this is the repercussions of the whole ‘Wenger Out’ campaign. The club is in absolute crisis.
Lee looks like a goblin straight out of Harry Potter. :D
What a berk
You'll be fine.
You think White is gonna rescue you?
Arteta Has to go, most useless manager Arsenal have ever had, zero tactics, just pass out from the back and lose the ball with zero attacking threat, under Wenger we had Sébastien Squillaci and Silvester with bentner and Chamack up front and we played better attacking football than what we have now, absolute joke of a club have a good young side playing terrible football, the arsenal I grew up watching is slowly dying before my eyes
Aftv will never ever had ENOUGH!! They will be saying the same things every season, and hope something change. 'Be the change who you wanted to see' Start a Protest Robbie ffs, you guys have the power to do so. Its the only way I Believe. Stop these nonsense videos. Start a Proper Proper Protest.
Gundogan glided through the air like a salmon 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You’re a trash side. Accept it and get relegated 😅
Absolutely love these meltdowns, brilliant.
5 foot midgets - Lee Judges 2021
Wenger back!
Lee is Right........Kolasinac was our best defender today sadly
Where is DT ?
Big sam might save ye lol
Arsene Wenga Out! No, I mean Atertha Out!
Sack Arteta or Arsenal will end up being relegated.
Ty: "hopefully they will ban headers soon cos of dementia, then our defenders won't have to head the ball".
It’s not the coach fault, it’s Kroenke fault who doesn’t want to invest..
Look at the job David Moyes has done at west ham in less time with hardly any funds, to the shambles at the Emirates deadwood being bought for millions on top of the deadwood already there,a multi million pound championship squad next season by the looks of it.
I swear Callum chambers, Ben white and Rob holding are literally all the same player 🤣 absolute shambles
Where is DT?
Holding played well. No protection in front of him is the issue especially if you have a senior player and club captain who does that then you don't stand a chance. At least next season mid week games will be back but not in Europe but against Ipswich or Derby!
He should be called Lee The Sword coz the way he starts swinging that weapon about from 4 and half mins on is just beautiful.
Im loving this 🤣🤣🤣 arteta for coach of the season Arsenal fans after the brentford game  ben white isnt good enough. Also arsenal fans the last 2 games we miss ben white 🤡🤡🤡
Even Britain did not battle with 5 Tanks in the 1st world war front line,need  player like Viera and others , we never see Arsenal like this even tell me if I am wrong relegated club or Aliens do  play 5-4-1?
Arsenal is a joke lol 😂
We dont have 2 of our best defenders... our best central midfielder. Pre-season training isnt the best. Chill 😁. However, sell Xhaka even the price isnt right, dont see much in him. Get a huge, quick with abundant of energy central midfielder. Quickly get rid of lacazette and get a exciting young prospect. Haaland is result of gambling on youth. The new signings so far are good 😇. I do not think a new coach will work wonders. Only 2 things: 1)The team click and everyone of them step up. 2)New coach + 400 million 🤣
Look at the positive Arsenal fans atleast you will be top of the table next season ——— in the CHAMPIONSHIP !!!!
Arsenal is back!
I walked out today, it also got a rowdy as you can imagine, Mikel Arteta can’t pull this back, nor can he get us to show fight, watching the game I was confused to what we were trying to do, players not getting back fourth into a back four or five, it was a mess way before Xhaka went off too, his tackle didn’t look bad at the the time and I’m yet to see what it was actually like :(
You do NOT! Want to tell this guy to trust the process
Silly question, Where's DT?
Why hasn't half these players gone ???? It's a joke
I like Lee, he reviews the tactics rather than blaming individual players...Arteta out
Flip the table then we're in first place
Where has DT gone?
Lol. Are u mad. U need to change half of the team to get results, not a coach only. Defence line needs to change completely
TY-"Pep was sad that he didn't get Kane so we gave City a 5 goal win to make them feel better..."
Told you you would be bottom of the league by the end of the day 🤣
Arteta just needs more time, don’t lose the faith bro.
Hate i just hate this f***king club
A blame the captain
Are so call captin gets a yellow card then go's in two footed and gets sent off how can you blame the manager for gods sake....
Get big Sam in
Ty: if the multiverse hypothesis is correct then we've got to be top of the league in one of them
Fans and gammons out more like!
Lee is so high he is calling players Midg.... he is that anyway..
Didn't even score a goal yet in 3 matches . Terrible
Whatever you say about the result you can only ask your players to give it their best and this Arsenal team have not been giving their all for a number of years now. This is not a manager problem it's a player problem and only the players can sort this mess out if they apply themselves to the task in hand.
Jaysus, Arsenal rock bottom on 0 points and minus 9 goal difference. From the Invincibles to complete shambles. Conte in, turn the ship around before you go full Titanic
5 ft 4 midgets. Bit insulting baldy.
ARTETA OUT! well said lee word for word
COYS ! 🤣😂🤣
Arsenal to be relegated haha
Frustrating for me is this squad is more capable than this. Also that it took 3 goals & going down to 10 men for the Arteta to bring on an DM (regardless of what you think of Elneny)
Arteta is building something special here, have faith. If you get relegated at least you will have the Championship to concentrate on 😂😂
There has never been a process, just one man's stupid ego. The dude is clueless. His spendings are horrendous, his choice of players are rubbish. How can the players you want to ship out be the ones manning your defense against mancity? You have to really hate those arsenal fans clapping for him. How do you give a thumbs up for a useless performance like that? Some arsenal fans just love being part of failures. You can't blame them, most of them didn't even witness arsenal at her best. Pathetic.
"it's not conference level it's incompetence level" 😂😂😂
Robbies new extension paid for today......
Where is dt? Aint seen him in ages
Banter Club FC
That reminds me  I've got 3 episodes of hawaii 5-0 to watch later 🤔
Good Ebening
Where did DT go?
Hahahahahahahahahahahahaaahahahahahahahahahahjaahahjaahuaahahaujhahjahahahahahhahahaqhhqqhqhqhqhqhqhqhqhqhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣😂😂🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂😇😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂🤣😂😂😇😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂SO FUNNYYYYYYY HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Use the code AFTV to sack Arteta ... LMAO
I swear all arsenaldo is blame it on the manager its your players  there ded ballers
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👍🏼
Where is DT at ?
Oh here we go again..!! Blame it on Arsene Wengers signings..!! Same old tune..We have just spent millions on players and it's all Wengers fault..
arteta  please leave my club asap
Eddie Howe incoming
Get Big Sam at least hes a fecking manager , and not a cone boy . Arteta get out of my club !!!!!!
Hahahahahahaha Arsenal are dead, dead dead dead dead. Absolute joke club blud
MAKE SURE YOU PARTEY HARD 2NYT VOLDERMORT
not getting luiz contract extended is a mistake, our current central defenders were a joke cannot defend nullified any headers
Gonna have to pick out your PL goal of the month from one of you training sessions you clowns PARTEY PARTEY HARD ZUM ZUM ZUM ZOOM ZOOM
2:06 Gundolan 😂😂😂
No structure no style no tactics. This manager is out of his depth and breaking every record on the wrong end in the history of Arsenal. Man City scored twice without trying inside 15mins, three touches for the 3rd goal. Is this what we have to be excited about while other teams forge ahead with better managers
Not only a coach, the entire team sucks. When you don't spend on transfers how can you win. Now, nobody wants to come.
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. I understand we aren’t the best team in the world but I ask for is a bit of fight. Show me something. This game showed me the coach and these players do not care. If we keep this up all our young players will leave
Even a proper coach can’t save arsenal….
Arsenal can only beat kids now!!!
Wenger in!
Happy birthday Lee sorry you had to wach this garbage today but your not alone mate
Stop this nonsense, the managers you sacked won trophies else so calm down with your forever sack the manager nonsense.
Arsenal are a total disaster. You never know who is going to turn up on the pitch and what is going on with Ben White? Even when he is on the pitch he is hardly going to be dominant in the air, Brighton must be laughing all the way to the bank. Who is making these buying decisions and who is picking the team? It is an absolute shambles.
I can't understand arsenal fc any more.
Hey Lee I am also arsenal fan I know. How's your feelings are heart that was truly bad to watch that its really bad experience
Happy birthday lee, he’s right as always
Robbie loving this. He have 2 millions subscribers by Christmas BANTER FC
Not an Arsenal fan, but I feel so bad!!
The whole team capitulated after 10 minutes wtf
Sorry Lee but you've become the biggest flip flop on aftv
Well You won 3 FA Cups in recent years. For once As Liverpool fans I did envy Arsenal.
Who TFS Gundolan😂😂😂😂
Ahh the Gunners we know and love
You Arsenal fans are so thick all quick to blame your manager like anyone else would do any better. You got exactly what you deserved wanted wenger out who got you into the top 4 and now look at you swapping managers won’t make a difference
Happy birthday the judge. Shame the result wasn't there. Got spurs on my birthday 🙄
Don't feel sorry for "fans" who went there,they are part of the problem.Kroenke won't leave if we keep lining his pockets. Don't go to games and don't buy kits if y'all can't then all this shouting about won't do anything.
Just here to read the comments🤣. Come on you SPURS 💪🏽
Bring the n Wenger for this season only
Enough is enough, bring Brendan now to coach our team
We really need aouar , bissamou & conte
Goals this season in the Premier League: Michail Antonio: 4 Arsenal:0
Let's all laugh 😃
Gundolan 😂🤣😂
I like that Arteta benched the one player that was a breath of fresh air on the midfield the past games...
19.1% possession.. The only team with a lower possession ever in the PL was QPR against City's 3-2 win in 2012!!
So Lee got a 5-0 and an 8-2 from Manchester clubs on his birthday
Mr Wenger should come back till the end of the season and then perhaps the arsenal fans will fully appreciate how great he was for the club
Lee Forgot about Granit Xhaka red card 😂😂😂
The amount of times he says Shambols says it all😞😅
Hahahahahha
Why did you all chanted "wenger out" again? So was it a good idea?
yes!!! why saliba on loan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Get rid of that LV General ffs!!! Please Robbie he knows nothing about football let alone Arsenal,  DT and Troopz had knowledge and passion LV is just nonsense and noise!
When Lee is angry...he is angry!
What has happened to DT or has he left AFTV and i have missed that Video
More shaving of Kiwis are needed
Trust the process... delusional supporters and owner
Saliba should be back in January Simple.
Where is DT these days
i watched the match today and it was disgraceful how the arsenal players played ,the manager he hasnt got a clue if he has well then the players dont respect him ,at the end of the game i watched the arsenal team go to the arsenal fans and clapp them and aubamejand looked looked soleless ,he looked distraught ,what going on with arsenal football club the club other teams used to be afraid of now there a joke ,and by the way im a cit fan but i love football and a sorry state the gunners are .
Banter Fc 😂😂😂😂😂😂💀
Per mertesacker you're our only hope
You’re literally getting relegated hahahahahaha
The man who's name cannot be said is angry af now. 5ft 4 midgets this guy kills me
Lee should get a job in the dressing room 😅
Hey Lee, Happy Birthday from N17   Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Keep changing managers like clothes when will these idiots learn it’s not the managers it’s the owner u mugs  The managers are puppets not there fault  rip Arsenal
Happy birthday Lee! Don’t let this club get you down or ruin your life anymore. Done with Arsenal and FARTETA
I love this channel 😂😂😂😂😂
Btw, Lee is the only guy Arsenal can be proud of. True story
Lee has the intensity of an imperialist, and we should all be worried.
Arteta get clapped, Wenger gets knifed in the back. Scum Arsenal fans.
Ty “We were wearing red so so we couldn’t see in the sun
The Judge has passed sentence on Arteta: it's the gallows for the manager.
I’m glad Saliba isn’t playing wouldn’t want to tarnish him with this mess
I look at this arsenal squad and i see a team that may not be among the top 4 squads, but they clearly have a side that should be playing europa league. This is NOT a bad squad. You have proven quality players in allmost every position.  Just take a step back and look at it. You have abu, esr, saka, ødegaard, martinelli, pepe, partey, lacazette and so on.. Yet they cant score a single goal in 3 games? These are top top quality players, better then tottenhams squad for certain.   .. Then the question is who is the weak link, who is not proven.. WHO has never shown his quality.. Arteta and Edu, thats who!
Sad thing is that it was obvious at the end of last season that Arteta was not up to the job, and we've wasted a whole summer of preparation, a whole transfer window and £130million propping up a sinking ship. That's down to the Kroenke's and their lack of understanding of "soccer".
Unless arsenal get rid of the kroenkes it will only get worse
Can you believe lee is only 21.. look what you have done arsenal
At this point, I think Lee's other name is "Rant" cos every interview these days has that
Happy birthday Lee
Arteta is absolutely rubbish. No spine in midfield n defence. I said it that why not let David luiz spend 1 more year, bring saliba back n make them play 3 at the back for saliba to learn....
Saliba watching the match today, and thx God he is been loan doesnt have to play under arteta
When in doubt...blame Wenger
Steaming 😬
Where’s DT,defending is a total embarrassment to Arsenal football club
0 to 60 in 0.8 seconds 😤
It was a really poor performance I expected the loss but that was a joke,xhaka challenge was a yellow both feet were low but the games was already gone,Saliba should be here fighting for a spot not holding or kolasinac joke.
If city were causing problem to arsenal defense with crosses imagine what Ronaldo is gonna do to them 😂 Ben white might as well get ill agian
Skybet Arsenal incoming.
Name a proper coach that would take the arsenal  job.. just 1
Second goal clear foul on Chambers not given. Then the red card. Game over.
That's all right mate. Keep Arteta for life. One day he will make it happen for Gunners in the year 3023.He is building let him build his team.
lee says it spot on
Capitulation fc 🤣🤣🤣😭😭
I will stop supporting these hamrolls. Enough is enough.
Problem is these sub-standard players. NOT THE MANAGER !
So the new AFTV consists of people who don't go to the games except for Robbie? Boring
Tierney supposed to be our best player. Today we concede the first goal when he intercepted a long ball to his side. Cross comes in and Chambers were beaten in the air.
The "5ft 4 midget" line had me.. .
It's true. I am convinced the coach needs to go
I think Arsenal should just have enough, to stay up.
Norwich next, but I'm not confident of even winning against them.  They'll have watched Brentfor's tactics, and know that Arsenal are there for the taking.
Been a Manchester City fan for 37 years I've seen some great Arsenal sides come to Maine Road and the Etihad but that Arsenal side was a shambles I like lee proper fan knows his football MCFC
Aftv is finished
Should rebrand this the comedy channel
Arsenal did well to hang in at 5-0, good job guys
Lee’s right now the hell does Arsenal centre backs make Man City look like Stoke scoring these headers. We had like 8cb’s I’m convinced all individually are some of the worst in the League
to be fair uv only lost 1 game against a side ud expect to win.
Arsenals problems have been thdre for all to see for years. They are just not good enough......
Can anyone tell me what has happened to DT???
Ty: just remember, Man City were at home and we had to travel. Tired legs and that.
Man i feel bad for arsenal liverpool fan :(
Where's DT?
COYSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
If Arteta has a bet of pride in him.. He should Leave the Club
Lmao! Arsenal fans are a joke!. Delusional!. What decent Manager would wanna come and deal with this bipolar fans. The Wenger Curse Continues. 😂😂 Make amends and Apologize to Wenger!
Can't wait to see another manger come in so they can see the real problem is arsenal player is average not good enough. Unai emery win europa league after leave arsenal say it all.
Please keep this up. Regards, all football fans
Not an Arsenal fan, actually a City fan lol - but cmon Arsenal, can you guys be better than awful? The whole league is better when Arsenal is decent. Can you guys at least get back to 6th? It’s embarrassing
I was telling my Chelsea friend I thought the score would be 4-0 and he said I was being pessimistic.. apparently not pessimistic enough 😅😑
With WENGER , we said we're in frying pan , but after WENGER we went directly from the frying pan into the FIRE.
Can someone please check up on DT
To quote claudes famous words It's time to go
Happy bday lee 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
Lee, the voice of wisdom 👍🏼
When is my generation is going to enjoy good football from shambolic arsenal team. Getting tired tired tired week in week out
Arteta knows what he's doing. He bought these young players as a ready-made excuse that he's rebuilding. Clubs like AFC don't rebuild. Arteta should be out tomorrow.
Where is the process?  Just trust the process & next season we win the league,  in the championship.
Time for the Dark Lord to use his power and bring back Arsenal from the death.
spurs fans are loving this
5'4 midgets FeelsBadMan
Why did Arsenal stick with JUNK sorry Jaka.  Right now we belong to a lower devision (Arteta=Junk, Jaka=Junk,  Arsenal FC=Junk
Allow it Arsenal, no one deserves this on their birthday.
Same old Arsenal Nothing New Shambles all day long
Lee go and have a few beers to forget this rubbish happy birthday
I said it for years, you should've hired Rafa while you had the chance. He may not have taken you back to the top of the league but he would've organized the defense and stabled the club.
Who VOTE for them OUT....
Wenger in!
More signings they have spent over 130 million
Arteta, you need to go!! Arteta out! It doesn’t matter who comes in. This coach isn’t good  for the club.
Happy birthday lee
0-🤬 in 60 seconds
As long as Chambers is a center or right defender, Arsenal will not be able to win!!! even pep be a head coach arsenal fc!!!!! Chambers oh chambers Not LUKAKU, not HARRY KANE, not VARDY , even he lost the air duel with GUNDOGAN... WTF?????
Chelsea fan but Antonio Conte will turn your defence into a solid one. Arteta is good enough for an assistant coach or lower tier coach for now. Later he will come good.
Lee’s right, we need a manager who actually knows what they’re doing and are experienced.
"It's not Conference level, it's incompetence level" *DiCaprio meme*
Norwich will put up a massive fight, I know it! They will be looking forward to this ripe fixture.
9 per possession even with injuries is not acceptable its lower league standard.
Bit Michael Caine at times!
🍿
Why are you blaming this players let be honest with ourselves is this selection right even in chanpions league if you are going for draw you play this nonsense this guy is not capable for this job Arsenal is bigger than Arteta
We must not forget it's been raining 🤣
Lee is a LEGEND! Arsenal dont deserve him as a fan
Why does Lee not go to the games anymore?
Imagine trying to make a goals of the month montage for arsenal.
As a Millwall supporter you do have a brilliant CB or DM in Ballard, I am surprised you loaned him to us for a year as like when we had Harry Kane, Ballard is already ready for the premier league
Poor Lee had to see us lose 8-2 and 5-0 on his birthdays FFS
I can just imagine how Claude would’ve felt had he been here. RIP Claude, you missed a doozy. Happy Birthday Lee. Nuff respect
Bring Wenger in to steady the ship until the end of the season and then see who is next for the manager position
Not gonna happen lee aslong we still got that stan kroenke in charge nothing is gonna  happen .
Ty - stand on your head and we’re top! 👍
Still lot's of kissing in the match which was noted 🤡
This guy was watching his phone almost the whole time in live.  He couldn't bare to watch.
😂🤣🤣🤣 I’m loving this…
I don’t get why they always blame the manager, it’s the players that played bad. I don’t think it’s fair
Midget is a hate/ slur word....i sill expecting a apology
Need Ramsdale in goal for one. Leno can't pass the ball
Smallest club in london. You guys are a complete joke hahaha. And dnt blame arteta, your back 3 and goali are so bad they would not get into the starting line up of any of the top6 clubs. Sort out your defensive recruitments or you going to the championship
Man Lee. Happy birthday bro! Man you guys in Loudon need to come together and get this manager out off our club believe me  I am in the US and we are hurting l can't believe we play this bad. The Arsenal breaking stupid records! Please get this Arteta guy out. we are coming to London next from all corners of the world. We are coming from East Africa, West Africa and we  in the USA🇺🇸.
If I was Arsenal boss I would of had 2 or 3 combative midfielders that run for the team,The sending off wasn't a sending off either..... YNWA
Trust the process
Its not the same without DT Troopz and claud 😞
Lee is right, his time is up now, and all the fans do not need any more evidence to see how bad Arsenal are  falling. Bottom of the table after 3 games.
Let me tell u all spurs fans were loving this & unlike u for England Lee we were cheering every city goal 😂😂
I am patiently waiting for Ty Interview to hear how the ref and Pep was a cheat 😂
In over his head.  I was worried when he thought he could win champions league in 2 to 3 years.  That's so innocent and naive.  No one who understands football would set a lunatic target like that seeing the state of the club when he walked in.
Man City bigger then arsenal
Just a  gentle reminder that Spurs beat Man City.  I want you to remember that, hung over tomorrow morning.
Guys lets be honest just trust the process, Arteta is learning and he willncome good in future
As an Arsenal fan I'm disgusted by your comment. In all my years as football and Arsenal fan I've never seen a coach tactically better than Mikel Arteta and I think he's the best coach we ever have had. Back him and trust the process. We can still do this! We are Arsenal! COYG!
😂😂 Another battering boys!
You can only get 5 things As an Arsenal fan this season. 1. Post traumatic stress disorder  2. Delusional disorder  3. Antisocial personality disorder  4. Mood affective disorder  5. High blood 🩸 pressure
Conte to Arsenal incoming
Said it from the get-go, Arteta is not the man for the job. Experience is a high necessity for arsenal dc.
Where are arsenal fans that want to Protest Tomorrow is the Perfect time to Protest let's Save this Club
Nothing new. We will lose in such scoreline once in a while against top team
Man,arsenal is a loser,William Saliba is so good for he to be loaned by the so called Nonsense manager Arteta
I'm a Spurs fan but also a football fan. When clubs go through these situations I look to the senior players to lead. Sadly for Arteta, the senior players are letting him down.
This must of been one hell of a rant if they had to edit parts out. We’ll spoken.
Arteta In
Give Arteta a chance. We need him to entertain us week in week out 🤣
The "5 foot 4 midgets" part killed me. Hahahahahahhahhaha
Managers like Mourinho just made it look easy. Being a manager is very hard
A West Brom fan just told me football can be Poetic..I told u lots stop hype a 6nil win over a weak west brom..Now we know Arsenal level is the other Division
20th in EPL with zero goals. We might get a point at Norwich and somehow we would think we are good again. Our fans don’t deserve a team like this
ITS ABSOLUTELY SHAMBOLIC!!!!!!!😡😡😤😤😤😤🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Gundanan
arteta is a proper city agent.
Hahahaha banter
🤣That build up was epic
Absolute truths , btw where is DT?
Happy 26th birthday Lee.  If you guys didn't know Lee is actually 26 he just looks roughed up because he's a die hard Arsenal supporter.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY LEE!!!!!!!!!!!
Nice to see Arsenal heading towards a reverse invincible season
I don’t know how y’all cope😂😂😂
Ty:The weather was fantastic
With respect what decent coach will go to arsenal.  The best you could get is a Graham Potter
Glory supporter arsenal fans ,really bad losers
Talk Talk Talk.. no bite.. Arsenal fans need to use social media properly. Get a hash tag and force Arteta and the other stupid people running this club out. We need to do something at least
Its faaaaaaaaaaaaking shambles Robbie  😅😅😭😭
Lee.......Pls tell the board to sack this man
Where is Robbie bro?
How is kolasinac in team when he got relegated from schalke but saliba who got in french team of season not in team i dont get it
It's not conference level it's incompetence level 😅 love it
when arteta was first touted as becoming Arsenal coach i thought this was just paper talk because this job is way to big for him as a first job , turns out (sadly) my thoughts were correct,,
Worst window for man city under this ownership. Couldn't go after messi because wanted kane. Messi goes yo PSG, Kane doesn't happen. And now Ronaldo as well. In the same month, they bottled signing Messi, Ronaldo and Harry Kane. Wow!!!
130m and at the bottom hell no arteta is not a coach he should go and learn more
Lee: maybe am stupid🤣🤣😅
Lees rage is real. He starts calm and the moment he starts speaking he loses his cool.  I love watching his videos. Great fan
Win next game, arteta be best thing since sliced bread🙄
Its even funnier cuzz its on his birthday 🤣🤣🤣 where tf is the troopz and dt video? I vould use a good laugh
Wenger out!
Gundolan?? FFS
Arteta should have never been hired, pep proved that arteta is only good for lining training cones in training
Where is Ty we need some positivity asap
He's got go now
I said it from first day that Arteta will never be good enough. Farteta
Arsenal after Arteta in and Ozil out like pieces of sh**🖕🖕
Get Conte😑
100% agree with Lee
Let's be honest.... we're all waiting for Ty 🍿
Lee literally asked Tierney to allow Bernardo to cross the ball into the box. 'let him cross it, let him cross it...naaaawww defend it'. Why 'interview' a clown who wants his team's full backs to allow crosses into the box. Freshen it up and bring it others who can give arsenal fans a better image.
Lord Voldamort unhappy on his Bday
FLIP FLOP JUDGES
Jesus Robbie's shed some pounds
Brilliant interview. Last of the old skool. Get angry and care.
TY: at least arsenal will be promoted from the championship
Look on the bright side, EFL Champion by 2023... Hopefully. HAHAHAHA
Love Lee. Love AFTV... Without yal, I'd be going mad.
I've been saying arteta out for over a year but nobody listens. I opposed his appointment in the first place because he has no experience . We need a proven experience world-class manager.
If you flip the league table upside down, Arsenal is at the top of the league. One of the favorites to lift the title this season.
Your club is a joke 😂
Roy Keane for manager. He wants a new job
I'm disappointed granit sent off so really stupid and defences tht not enough well
The fans need to protest! We’re a laughingstock. PROTEST AT THE EMIRATES
to think.....this is the club that produced The Invincible team....wtf happened...
to think arsenal sacked emery for less.....this guy just gets let off all the time....wtf is happening...
Lee speak sense
Man said 5ft4 midget 🤣
Lee should be happy with the generosity of arsenal
😂😂🤣 Lee kills me starts of at a 0 and ends up raging at a 10 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Its funny these guys wanted wenger gone and and everthing i bet they  regret it now😂
I would trust Lee to run this team and just have Arteta put the cones out for him, which he must have done well at City.
Please stop showing Ty shaving kiwis at the start of every video.. It's disgusting.
Completely agree with Lee. Arteta should be coaching championship sides to test his ideas on. We should have got Tuchel or someone after Wenger. Think for years we've been sold too many lies from the hierarchy at Arsenal.....now it's all coming back to haunt us.....If we don't get some experience in soon, we are screwed. This is bad times for us Gooners.
Wenger must be loving it. Be careful what you wish for
"OWNERS out, EDU out, ARTETA out" "QATAR oil in and CONTE in" A.S.A.P.
Sports fans are thr dumbest sector of society.  They sit at home and criticize professions who's been in the sports for most of their lives . "SACK this guy, sack thst guy"  Arsenal HAD a proper manager who they said sack.   Its unbelievable  how dumb people are .
Arteta changes the team too many times.
Gundaland
Manscapped is really suiting the situation rn.
I want Guendouzi back man, a person who was instrumental in us winning Fa cup ...... including beating Man City ...... Xhaka no more..... we need better DM players to back track midfielders making runs
Enough is enough now. Arteta has to go, too many poor decisions in big moments. Saliba decision is borderline unforgivable, and then to play Kolasinac against the Champions is criminal
The gift that keeps on giving. Arsenal fc !!
Arsenal only goal scored on training ground
Lee”we laugh so we don’t wanna get angry and cry” legend
My faves on AFTV are Robbie, Lee and Pippa.
When you lose to Brentford then Chelsea you have to expect this result.
Lee is going to look like Claude by the end of the season
& it gets worse 30th November VIVA RONALDO comes to slaughter you..................................
Coulda got big Kris Ajer for 13m.  Woke joke club
Our tactic and selection today was amazing
Ole at the wheel 🔴⚫️⚪️
Arsenal --- the gift that keeps on giving.  LMAO!!!!
I wonder what AMN did to Arteta after the FA Cup win. I expected him to regularly start at RB after that but he's faded into the background.
Hahaha, after that rant and how many times Lee slatted Arteta and said get him out, Cesil still asks Lee is he Arteta out...Hahaha, Really Cesil. Don't forget that they making a Documentary on this crap. Never thought i would see the day my beloved Arsenal were this bad, Very very sad.
As a Liverpool fan I tbh I used to come here for a good laugh like many other rival fans but today I come here with a heavy heart.. Arsenal are a massive club who were always renowned for their stylish effective brand of football and to see where they're today really pains me "anyone team can be were Arsenal are today including my Liverpool with poor ownership and management!" I think the good loyal fans of the club need to make one major stand not only to sack the coach but get rid of those inept owners who destroyed the club and turned them into a laughing stock
I love Lee’s rants. Silver lining on getting hammered.
But Willian went to Arsenal to win The Champions League 😂😂😂😂
8 - 2 AND 5 -0 BDAY SPL 🥴
Bottom of the league 🤣🤣
I still don't understand how a match was played for 90 minutes, plus extra 3 minutes on each half , making it 96 minutes .yet Arsenal couldn't get 1 corner kick...
I feel sorry for Lee Judge Come and Join the best team in London 💙💙💙💙💙
8:35 is Reality
Makes you wonder why the fans are being charged £2000 for a season ticket.
How can a rookie be upgraded to a manager level when he obviously NOT even good enough to be a coach? Only at Arsenal you’ll see that happen.  What a disgrace from the owner to the board down to the management!
All of this saliba talk would do your head in ,he played for the u23 then loaned out and now that he's playing good in the french league he's world class .same crap with Guendouzi he was bad when he was with arsenal , always sideways , backwards passing and a shocking attitude,now Aftv want him back but never had a good word to say about him
Happy birthday Lee 🎂 Love this guy!!!❤
IF Arteta has ANY respect for the club, he'll quit.
Even Arteta coaches today on the bench Arteta looked at them and they couldn’t say anything Arteta got the wrong sort coaches around him as well they all need to go seeing there stupid faces smiling 3.0 down
Where is the anger meter??
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If our players showed at least HALF as much passion as Lee shows on the pitch - us fans can at least get behind the team and Arteta, because this is absolutely shambolic. It is NOT an over-reaction from Lee, he is SPOT ON!
one name "Antonio Conte"
Yes we need a coch
I pay attention to critical moments in the game. Arsenal looked competitive for the 1st 8 mins but how does gundogon beat chambers to  a cross from that distance?
Lee say let Arteta go before he goes MAD lol 😂😂😂🤣🤣
A major issue if the mind set of you players.Some have  been weak and care free in their attitude for over a decade. Klopp,Pep etc..wouldn't put up with players not giving 100% physically and mentally every game. Auba,sums up Arsenal, plenty of talent but decides when he wants to play. Some of these players have little respect for the fans. Arsenal are a great club but are making bad mistakes.
why was odegard playn CDM, jesus christ, lokonga ws our best player in midfield and arteta dropped him, thigs like this re the reasons wr where we are
Even Norwich scored 😂😂😂
Next Arsenal manager.👍
This nobody demanding as if he owns the club 😂🤣😂🤣
Where's DT!!
Emirates fly better….  Arteta…..lose better
😂😂😂 YOU’RE RELEGATED! 🤣🤣🤣  Next season English Championships League new team are Arsenal FC. 😂😂😂   ⬇️ arsenal is going down ⬇️ 😂😂
love ty practicing shaving his balls  let lee do them when his angry
Voldemort angry says it all ;)
I just laughed when they had a midfield 3 of saka odegaard and smith rowe loool
Kroenke, Arteta and Edu are killing the club. The latter two being a duo of circus clowns. Arteta is incapable of managing people (which is the reason we sold Guendouzi and sent off Saliba on loan). I am sorry for the talented young people we have who have to play under such an incompetent leadership
Cheers Lee for the🤣🤣🤣. "Incompetence level"  "5ft 5 midgets beating us in the air" 🤣.  But on a serious note what's happening @ arsenal is beyond a joke now
big up lee speaking facts as always
I said from get go I didn't want him at arsenal as manager
This is rock bottom
Lee gunner said 5.0 today and I didn’t think it be that bad but got give it to lee gunner he got the score bang on
Cowards FC is more like it. Cowards, all of them were Cowards today. Embarrassing
Its not the managers fault, he can’t control if the defence chooses to play shite, why not just accept your team is dead
Arteta has to resign 🤝 simple
If you arsenal fans trust the process things will turn around 😂
i can’t believe i’m saying this but David Luiz leaving the club has made this defence worse. was quite underrated actually, despite there being a mistake in him. it’s shocking that we’ve started chambers and kolasinac in the same game against city.
Man, the invincibles sold a dream for a whole new generation of fans just to leave them depressed for a lifetime.
😂😂😂😂i cant😂😂😂😂😂😂Coys!!
Cecil's really asking dumb questions, he knows where he stands with Arteta and he's still asking if Arteta should go or not😂
I was trying to find out what kind of formation he was working with
“at least the kit looked nice” - Ty (2021)
I'm sorry but it doesn't matter who the manager is. We're never going to be able to turn things around until they bring new officials in. I'm not saying we would of won the game but these officials are biased af
Its not Arsenal anymore. It’s Assnal
19 premiership managers team talk before Arsenal game: OK guys.........it's Arsenal. Fill your boots.
Priceless Lee👏
Please spare us from this misery, Lee is 100% right if Saliba isn’t better than Holding Chambers Kolasniac!!!!
We  are done out there
Auba drive away in your ferrari!
How can fans be clapping that performance? We see that every week, shambles. We are an utter shambles.
Said yday they'll score a header as sterling done same last season that 3 are done at the club chambers holding Kolasnic need to be gone
Lee is right. Arteta does not know what he’s doing.
I said that city would beat  arsenal
"Whose fault is that?"  Yours, AFTV.  You got AW sacked and now the club is finished.    I only knew what hunted thought Quickened his step, and why He looked upon the garish day With such a wistful eye; The man had killed the thing he loved, And so he had to die.  Yet each man kills the thing he loves, By each let this be heard, Some do it with a bitter look, Some with a flattering word, The coward does it with a kiss, The brave man with a sword!  Some kill their love when they are young, And some when they are old; Some strangle with the hands of Lust, Some with the hands of Gold: The kindest use a knife, because The dead so soon grow cold.
You shat on Wenger, the man who built your club. Then, you shat on Emery, who went on to win the UEL with Villareal. Now, it's Arteta's turn. I guess it's easier to blame the coach when the issue is much deeper!
👏🏾👏🏾
I just woke up in the states to this...5-0! Lee is 100% right. We deserve a proper manager this is a disgrace.
He was on his phone the entire game 😂😂😂😂 sUpEr fAn lEe fark off
1st arteta we are happy with the 1st part of the transfer 2 arteta a lot of smiles at the press conference besides he lies to us the fans reacted well to the defeat 3 arteta we started well 2-0. 14 mins arteta tells us it's too hard for me to leave and we will apologize to you for so simple as that
Lee I'll buy you a drink!
The more he talks the better it gets YNWA
I think Arteta meant he will get them the Championship in 3 years 😂
assenal deserve to get relegated. such a stupid club they are lool my team man city was generous with 5 it should've been 10
Anyone know if DT still trusts the process ?
HOPE WE GET RELEGATED ALL YOU ARSENAL FANS  STOP GOING TO THE GAMES YOU IDIOTS I AM ARSENAL FAN FOR OVER 30 YRS!
i dont wna hear it city, so wht we shud just lay dow like we did, no wy will i ever accept this arteta has to go.
Happy Birthday, Lee. Hope you live a long and healthy life.
Spont on from Lee!
Arteta has had enough time. There is big problems behind the scenes but what makes it worse is a incapable manager. It is possible to have a badly run club with a great manager I.e wenger but when you have a clueless manager also it is game over. Lee knew and saw this coming as did a lot of us. Big Sam in!
GuNdALaNd
Three first games  back to back to back losses
Arteta has to stay.
and then the defenders were high fiving each other after 5-0.. this defense is laughing stock.
Please do not let Lee comment again on AFTV..... Heart leads head
Ben white loses most heading battles, so no miss
Rip Sam Oji shameful the players didn’t go on one knee to pay respect to him
TY: The fatigue kicked in Robbie, the FA are against us. who in their right mind scheduled a Big Game against West Bromwich Albion Midweek then has us play Man City early on the Saturday? The FA are clearly against us
You lot need to stop playing football "the Arsenal" way and try to park the bus and play for scraps off the counter. There's nothing enough talent to compete with the big teams
CONTE in ARTETA out ASAP.
Lee should try to petition for the manager position at Arsenal because he could probably do BETTER in placing his players towards success than Mikel Arteta. That’s horrible tactics and defensive adjustments.
Time for big Sam
No 1 team arsenal can beat in PL this season,u 'll see
Leno out Atkinson also out Almost Every Goal there was offensive Fouls so we were Not help from the officials and the red Card was no Card at all
Arsenal are shite
I miss the post match stadium interviews
Happy birthday Lee. Do not let Arsenal spoil your day. Enjoy!
Ty and that stupid Potato and shaver bad enough this club a joke put ty shaving a potato even more stupid 😂
Voldemort child with a Hobbit = Lee
Arteta has to go the ownership an edu
Trust the process guys
Where's my miniature violin come on you Spurs
Arsenal is a disgrace
Who said Arteta was Pep's assistant? Did that come out of Pep's mouth or did we all just assume that was the case? I'm going with the latter
Lee's transition from calm to total anger is smoother than Arsenal's def to attack transition in the last 5 years.
I feel quite bad for ARSENAL fan's Its not funny anymore
YES i can taste the Arsenal tears MUUUWAHAHAAA  COYS 😂
Enough of the ty jokes it’s boring and not funny
Why keep playing Auba on the left when he is BETTER on the right lol arteta has no clue
Just get in 22 new players and you're sorted
I predicted ranting and more ranting what do we all are good at this franchise has been declining for over a decade it’s rudderless clueless spineless full stop ps the new PR buzzword from the franchise is “ Operation Endsleigh”
Happy birthday Lee! Don't let Arsenal put you down!
Players should  be able to get the sack, It's all well and good sacking managers but the likes of Chambers, Holding and Xhaka, should be sacked.
Why u believe if arteta out fix arsenal problems why ask year to year increasing players not deserve wear arsenal t-shirt
Where’s DT?
It is working , for me . I love arteta think he’s brilliant Id go as far as to say he’s better than poch lol 😂
Lee is the new Claude - IT'S NOT WORKING
Fire  arteta now😔
What's with these punch in's?? Lee must have went off loool
Sambi Navares Ben White? where is this playera.
Arsenal will be the invincibles of the Championship next year
memang main macam hampeh..dari dulu sampai sekarang..
Enjoy the championship LOLOL
"Trust the process"....Now I understand  what it means........Arteta is in the process  to get Arsenal  promoted in next 2 year for the PL coz we are going to get relegated this year 100%...Bunch of Jokers running the club and made this club to Circus football club. Unai Emery was far better manage than this clown.
I turned on my speaker to full volume for the first 5 mins, after that I have to turn the volume down... he's pissed alright
I ran out of popcorn here.
Why was the video cut into bits?
Arsenal's a proper top world class club! It demands a top class manager and top class players! It have none of that!  Probably needs top class chairmen too...
Arteta get rid start with a New top manager  now long term and the Arsenal board need to back him .then and only then will Arsenal FC get back on track and be a threat again.
Who's Gunderlan???
Coach would bring Nothng is the board the problem
He drunk defo
At this Rate I can see AFTV getting listed on  the stock market by christmas ..Robbie you genius
No better thing than tuning up to Arsenal Fan tv after loss lmao
Thing is the squad is piss poor. A new manager will get a marginal improvement but no better than top 10 league finish
I hate Arsenal wiht all my guts as a spurs fan but watching lee rn just made me sad. He really cares
No manager will succeed at Arsenal because of they way the club is being managed  We can sack Arteta now and the next manager will face the same problem  Nothing will change until the club is sold to an ambition owner
The way his anger builds up😂😂😂
I would sell Chambers and Holding for free. Useless defenders and know nothing about positioning. Handicapped by brain.
All comedies in this world are nothing for AFTV.
As long as the mug fans keep paying get ready to get used to this crap! Clapping mugs at the end
Lee’s came a long way since bounce by the ounce
Who the F… gave the thumbs down? The man talks more sense than Arteta!
TY:We lead 2-1 on yellow cards and 1-0 on red card
This sums up why i have no time for clowns like Lee and Turkish they say they want the owner gone but want the same ownership to appoint a new manager it makes no sense and you can bet your life on it if a new manager comes in and this still happens they will call for him to go what needs to happen is Arteta stays our value drops to the point Stan sells and we get a owner in who actually cares and if he sacks Arteta then so be it
I have just traveled back 20 years from 2041. I am here to urge Arsenal fans to stick with Arteta. According to my timeline it will get worse at Arsenal in the short run, much, much worse, but Arteta WILL pull it around and deliver multiple honours to this great club. I urge Arsenal fans to be patient.
Arsenal FC board should of got a top manager in in the first place long term.  This is the board failure in the beginning from Wenger .
I want lord ty video, come on don upload it right now
I think lee should have a beer during all the watch alongside
Lee is spot on as always…
Gumdolan, come on Lee you butchered the geezers name 🤣
Arsenal are the reason Lee is bald
19% possession and  0 corners 😂
The fact that this video has been cut and edited tells you how mad the judge is
This channel is blowing everytime arsenal loses 🤣🤣
Going down. Said that b4 season. One of the three worst squads in division and rank bad manager
Where is Saliba? What is your game plan? Leave the club before more disgrace...
He'll get tennis elbow at this rate
Wenger : Arsenal Do you miss top 4 with a bellow avg team?
Man said Gunland😂😂😂😂.
Arsenal premier league goal of the month?
Oi bruv mate nah blud innit.
Joke of a club
AFTV my guilty pleasure when arsenal lose lol
The true reason why arsenal can't win is they don't have a captain. Let's be real no one currently at arsenal is captain material and if there is no one to hold the team together on the pitch, no one to take inspiration from, then the team crumbles.
We went in there with a defeated mindset. Hence we did not even try! Another thing -Arsenal has never been the same since my man, Santi Corzola, left! This is shadow of Arsenal! I don’t blame Arteta. I blame the whole Arsenal organization that don’t want to buy the right players. They keep buying mediocre players! That’s a shame! I’m livid as an almost 20 years Arsenal fan!
I’m a the most loyalists of arsenal fans and I knew if I watched today after i saw the lineup I would be doing exactly what lee is in the video this is beyond embarrassing..
Well said Lee, Happy Birthday mate!
Gundogan out jumps your 6ft plus cb, Xhaka is wreck less as hell.  Arsenal fans: blame the manager
I even had to take my Coat off to watch this
INJECCCCT IIIIIITTT!
The rage 😂
🎶 YOU’RE BOTTOM OF THE LEAGUE  YOU’RE BOTTOM OF THE LEAGUE   OHHHHHHHHHHH  YOU’RE BOTTOM OF THE LEAGUE 🎶
ozil is out for footballing reasons...arteta is a joker
Lee Judges genuinely cares about Arsenal. Deserves so much better. Sad to see.
The centre halfs probably won't head it for fear of getting dementia in 70 years 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ty:   Yeah, we all know away goals count more.  it doesn't matter what net it's in
This guy keeps asking dumb questions
AVADA KEDAVRA!
Starting, kola, cedric and then elneny,xhaka,chambers,holding, that is quality arteta need,not saliba,Matteo,torera,and willock that arteta for u!!! Trust the process bushit
We've gone from a title-challenging team 15 years ago to a top 4 team, to a Europa League team, to a top 10 team and now... we're objectively worse than at least half the teams in the Prem. When will the slump end?
This makes me Cry 😢 Arsenal supporting you Hurts.
Arsenal gonna be the premier league’s Shalke
All the ty jokes are played out now lol
They have so many players out, I think people are being to harsh judging now. See where we are after 10 games.
Ty: We wanted City fans to feel a little better, because they're very sad due to the Ronaldo transfer.
I just saw the score, and looked at the league. Arsenal are bottom of the league. Even in the lean days of the late 70's and early 80's I never saw it this bad. Wow, The Arsenal are bottom of the league...
Fraudulance fam 🤣
“DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND GET OUT THE CLUB NOW” whether you agree with him or not Lees funny man 😂😂😂😂😂
Lee’s head is going to go from 🥚->🍳
watch your heart
I wonder where is DT? Haven't seen him in a while
you lot threw wenger under the bus and emery
Lees correct arteta out
“GUNDOLAN” 😩
So, I’ve listened to some of the post-match interviews on AFTV after today’s capitulation against ManCity. The common idea, which was often being mentioned, is that Arsenal fans, who came there to support the team, do not deserve what they are receiving back from the players. But my question is, what does that have to do with anything? Why do they think that the players owe them and that if they came to the stadium, they deserve to be entertained and receive the highest possible effort from the team? It sounds like the fans are carrying out a heroic act by coming to the stadium on a weekend, when, in fact, it’s a way of leisure and relaxation for most of them. The same question applies to the supporters of any other team, of course.
The channel has lost its entertainment quality. This should have been the golden times for quality content for this channel.
I like Lee, only decent one on the channel.
ILLNESS PANDEMIC AT ARSENAL. Sack arsenal chef. His a spurs fan and all our players are falling ill for reason.
Poor management, organisation, administration # Arteta out
5000/1! Betfred! Lee to kidnap! Kronke!...he only needs £2.5 billion!😹🤣
Happy birthday to Lee. 24 years old today. Look what Arsenal have done to him.
Maybe Aftv should stop making videos during this period
Children’s channel
Lee could not of put it any better. Get the clown out simple.
How AFTV have the audacity to advertise at the start of this video given the situation we are in JOKE
I just want to shout out 'Gundalang'.
ITS TIME TO GOOOO (Claude voice) RIP
wtf you cutting out things????? whats the point????
what you man saying? next week you'll be celebrating
we need Conte .I beg
It is a new low for arsenal
Playing essentially a 5-1-4 against a team who’s strength is midfield 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Lee Aces.
Happy Birthday Lee. The only Arsenal fan I have a little time for.
Lee let it out 🤣
Voldemort going off 🤣
Arteta has to be sacked. Its unacceptable. We will be relegated if arteta stays I promise you that
The bald fella needs to calm down
Arsenal football club reminds me of the Nigerian government......ITS DEAD
Please out from our beloved club now Arteta, don't wait for the board ask you to do so...
i imagine only if guendouzi was here he would have been much better than Xhaka. Losing emery was a big mistake also for the stability of the team well we got what we deserve and this will continue until the board is gone and the manager even Edu
Arteta needs to be given time, he is definitely the right man for the job.              GGMU
Happy 19th Lee! 🥳
Yo what happened to dt
Trust the process
Happy Birthday Lee! Go enjoy a few pints!
Sometimes I dunno what lee is watching kolasnaic was our best defender? For me holding was our best by far Kolasnaic was all over the place!
Tierney was no where for the first goal he should have stopped the cross way before it came in. Odegaard was no where he was like this last year and you did not see it, if he was any good he would be at Real Madrid 😡🤬. Kolasnic was piss poor he’s like a cart horse, where was lokonko and tavaras why are they on the bench. Where was Auba? If Kane was playing he would be all over the pitch helping, he ambles around doing nothing. This team is the worse team I have seen for years 🤬🤬.
You had a "proper coach" his name was Arsene Wenger and he was the greatest manager you clowns ever had !  Even in his bad times he still managed to get you boys top 4 each season,CL football year in year out and a cup trophy nearly every year.
When he called Ilkay a MIDGET! I spit my coffee 😂😂😂😂
All I ever see this dude do is laugh , grin , smirk ! At least Robbie looks humbled when it’s serious !
Ty will still stand with this team
Where is Ty when we need him
Arsenal spent the most so far this transfer window too 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If your sticking with these dead players atleast av the ability to coach and improve them and let them.b a lil bit competitive atleast..he is clueless..teams that are worse and wit less resources av a fight a grit a bite a buzz about them..they have some form of strategy or tactics...arteta has  one he cnt improve these players or even coach..get him out plllss
Ty will still stand with this team
Robbie is going to make excuses for him...
Lee is absolutely right,why is Saliba on loan when we have Chambers who has never been any good as a CB? ARTETA IS A CONFUSED AND CLULESS MANAGER.
Arsenal 6-0 west brom- arteta in Mancity 5-0 arsenal-arteta out 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Had to pop in here after seeing that result 🤣
Everything about Arsenal is hilarious. They're the gift that keeps on giving.
Arteta in! I hope he stays at Arsenal forever.
Love it when Lee starts ranting - he explains how we all feel...
we must not forget the sun is shining
All my pals gooners and don't no what expect 8th last year, city champions at home , I fill you guys , Lee judges I like he says it how is and I respect , end day two hard game out way focus now after break ,best luck you
Cecil good job 👏 you have improved
Fans should understand that players are out of form and need more practice games for players to find out which one suitable for ideal position on the pitch and lack of quality among players which is easily noticed on every game and lack of fitness among the players to compete at different level which is need to addressed and lack spirit in the position like defending clearance(very sloppy attitute on the pitch and we need players to step up himself to compete with different opponents ) I do think Gabriel and white will bring the suitable attitute that positional change ,it will take time definetely.once players finds form and team spirit that unmatchable by any kind of opponents, we need to be patient on these young player who are all learning every game and buliding up an future of the club, we will wait for partey and other players to play in the next four or five games then only fans can expect more demands from the team,now it's a team to play for the club and not with a mindset to compete with the opponents which is easily identified  Gunners are young team that needs to progress to compete at different level to rectify it's mistakes from each game Step up step up and create much better results  👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Ozil in; Arteta Out!
can arteta at least manage his team at full strength at least once before he gets canned?  hold your horses mate
As  a Chelsea fan its mad how far they have fallen
Gabriel needs to stop interviewing Lee, get off AFTV and get on the pitch ….
The thumbnail made me laugh already 🤣
Bob the builder coming in!
😂😂😂 he started calm then ends up building anger to shouting quality
Ty: We lost because the game kicked off at 12:30 and the players were just getting ready to have lunch. It was an inconvenience to them. It should have kicked of at 3:00 like the rest of the games.
arteta is not a coach arsenal need a world class manager
Gutless spineless no passion in real trouble every time they go behind they fold
Where is Dt?
Arsenal fans always blame the manager, wenger out, emery out, arteta out now. The problem stems from the management, sacking arteta won't fix the problem. I feel like arsenal managers are scapegoats for the owners. Sad
its only 3 games-Robbie
I have given up I won't watch anymore game until they sack Arteta
I don't understand people like Cecil. Fair enough I understand the neutral stance but you're a fan. Have some fire. Even Robbie loses it at times
What a performance by Comedy Fc  👏 Bravo Mikel Bravo Xhaka.
Last week these feels were saying they wanted to see Arteta play three at the back…
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 brilliant
147 M Euro worth, for an opponent team. Every coin helps. ( Voice of Puck )
Stop with the upside down table joke . It's.....
If he had any respect for himself he would have come out and told BT I’ve spoken to the players, board and staff. I want to say thank you to the supporters but I have tendered my resignation after that performance today.   Why didn’t Leno come for the 6yd box cross? Ramsdale did on Wednesday.. 🤔
I rather watch Ty shave kiwi than arsenal
ive said the same thing. whats wrong with saliba
Fun fact: Lee is actually only 18 years old, he’s just gone through so much stress watching Arsenal that he’s aged rapidly.
Bottom of league my new home
havnt watched in over a year and wow aftv has changed a lot. shilling for ball shavers and what robbie too good to do the interviews now? and why are they not doing out the ground were they banned by arsenal lol.
They are trying to replicate their invincible form..  . . But the other way around! 🤭
Ty: We lost the game because we thought we were playing against Fernando Torres. It confused the players.
BUSTER BLOODVESSEL
I wish this Judges chappy would stop beating about the bush.
Why are we so afraid to let Kroenke know we want him to sell up & go he’s the one who keeps Arteta in a job when he should have gone from the Brentford game the owner is to blame time to let them know we want them out
Where's DT?
You lot wanted Wenger out......Hilarious....
worst arsenal team i have seen in 40 years..
Happy Birthday LEE 🎊🎉🎈
Lads, it's Arsenal.
Why are you editing the interview
This was like Mortal Kombat... flawless victory.. Man City taking souls! 🤣😂🤭
Love Lee's hand gestures. They're like GTA characters from the PS2 era
I can't believe it's taken Lee this long to realise 🤣
Lee always nails it spot on yet again. 👌
They only score headers against  Arsenal!Sterling heading above Holding at The Emirates and today Gindogan over Chambers!Arsenal..smh
Were bottom  It's time for Sam
3:22 imagine what they had to cut 💀💀💀
Really what was he saying back your manager clown that’s why this channel is a joke
Amen!!!! Wenger out! Now!
Please be patient, Arteta has a philosophy, the project is on.
So many records broken today by the scum from Woolwich……. Where’s Robbie and the remaining crew. The popcorn is ready!
why's lee stopped going to games?
I’m a Spurs fan but I honestly feel bad for Arsenal fans right now. You guys don’t deserve that.
Aruba was back
Chelsea are defo the no.1 club in London but Arsenal are slipping behind Spurs,West Ham and future opponents if they don't get relegated Millwall.  Also midgets can't be 5ft 4".
imagine what lee was like as a kid lol
Destroyed by a far superior team today simple as that
Its his birthday, and arsenal have done him dirty. Makes you understand his anger.
5'4 midgets did it...Killed it!
Oh yeah, sell Willock, banish Guendozi, mavropanos and sell our world class keeper and buy a back up for 10 mil more, and keep playing Cedric. Great manager.
Aftv the gift that keeps on giving
We need Ty
Ty : "We can still mathmatically win the league robbie"
“Ben white was out” 🤣🤣🤣 Every game we lose now we seem to use the player who did not play excuse as the reason why we lost. It was Aubameyang & Lacazette vs Brentford. Aubameyang was taken off today because he was that ineffective. Ben white played vs Brentford……..  Lol
"Before I go mad" Cecil looks to the camera. Lol quality
That trimming bit is the weirdest part of this video
Robbie be making bank off this loss
Robbie loving results like this - cue RANTS 💰
The defending was in shambles but Arteta used players available. I think you guys should stop opening your mouth and just talking cheap. Arteta, Arteta, Arteta for everything.
He's so stupid, Mari has been despicable, we need to sign an exp. cb
Ty: We lost because Robbie didn’t say ‘We’re gonna do this’ as he usually does and it negatively impacted the players 😂😂
What happened to that Greek cb that was meant to be the next best thing
"5 foot 4 midgets "                         - lee judges 2021
is anyone surprised by it....my hope was they could keep it down to four....lmao....arteta out....
Ty: At this rate will be at the top of Championship and thats a w for me
You all think Arteta is the problem. So the past has not taught you anything at all. "GOOD EBENING" all of you!
Arteta has to go please don't give him 10 games 🙄
trust the process lads, remember the fa cup
Lee started off calm then he went Voldemort mode , but still always spitting facts .
I have to agree with Lee, its not personal but all signs point to him not being good enough to take this team forward. We knew we wouldn't win the match but ffs what did we just witness 😞
Lee has the passion give him the job I keep saying it
Talk so much sense, i have never cursed watching a game by myself, my neighbors knocked the door thinking i was having a fight..
Ty : We won 6-0 against the mighty West Brom Fan : But we lost to City 5-0 Ty : Don't change the topic...
Fully agree with Lee
Exactly what I thought, Gundogan won 3/3 headers in the first 10 bloody minutes
Well said.   I can’t forgive the W.S loan
Don’t forget there’s a season under Wenger where we were beaten 5-0 by Liverpool, 6-0 by Chelsea and 5-1 by Man City. Still Arteta Out!
Ty shaving a kiwi 🥝 is about as dangerous as the gunners got today 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Time to go. Arsenal are last in the league. Top flight teams would not accept this. Get big Sam in!
Arsenal fans don't deserve these performances from the team and management
Arsenal fans have been saying ‘The defence has been a shambles’ for a good 10 years
I think he said widgets, not midgets.
From an ardent man united fan...Miss DT in such watchalongs..Hope he is doing well.
Happy birthday Lee!
Get bloody Voldemort of this channel …. pathetic fan
Oh no , it’s only 1, 2, 3 games. Give him time. This is what people have been saying. Stevie wonder could have seen Arteta is out of ideas.
Happy birthday lee ❤️
AFTV I'm sorry to say but you are causing the club more and more embarrassment, this channel is no longer for Arsenal fans to enjoy, more just for our rivals to laugh at our reactions, but hey at least you all get paid for it.
Do you need Double Jabs to go to Championship games? Just wondering…
lee always reminds me of like the cray twins innit proper well mannered but will defo kill ya lol  good chap
True Arsenal needs a proper manager
Lee is like progressive rock, there is always an intense guitar solo
As an Arsenal fan I feel Arteta is using Arsenal as practice to get ready for his future at city; he’s an agent too
None of us are happy so let me just say birthday 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Arsenal is a joke and the fans are a joke.
This club has caused Lee to lose his hair
Ty: "Man City had 91% possession in the second half and only scored twice. That's a positive"
NGl you guys deserved it after you started getting delusional when you beat West Brom  lmao
You cannot get rid of Arteta after he just spent £129 million.
Can I just say that this interviewer is very good.
When you sack Arteta and you get the new Coach, i believe the new Coach will also bring new players. Its so easy and so cheap to blame Arteta. No coach would have kept us from loosing today with the players available
are we allowed to say 'midget' ?
City fan here, good luck for the rest of the season
How can we believe in him ...it is simple he changes formation every game ......he does not get best out of the players........he does not know what damn system he wants to play..... He does not have the right players at right position........and one more thing he destroyed Gabriel martinelli confidence by not playing him last season.......  One legend said very early ......It's time to go
Cut at 3:18 what happened 👀👀
Men vs boys now you know how it feels beat a club 6-0 that was no need to after the match was won. Like you did it at West Bromwich
Lee with straight facts
Ty: We mustn't forget if you flip the table around we are actually on top isn't it
Everything Lee says makes sense unlike anyone else in AFTV
Can't wait for ty reaction
Ty= we got red card and there was a sun Me= wtf bro if there is a sun can we not win
Man City legend Arteta
Lee is an honest guy who you can see is hurting. No BS, you have to feel for him.
Ty: "It's not a red. We were robbed. Should have won 5-2."
Even the lunatics in the asylum wouldn't be crazy enough to follow arsenal
Wheres Robbie
Am sorry Lee! I hope for the better of the club
Imagine Arsenal doing the opposite of Invincibles
Arsenal died the moment Kroenke took over...Arteta is part of the  Big problem, I  support this club but not this Management the kroenke management is less likely desired at all 🏟
Come on Lee get Them dirty bastards out
😂😂😂😂😂😂
THANK YOU LEE you Said everything I wanted to say
ARTETA OUT EDU OUT KROENKE TF OUT!!!!!
I LUH YOU LEE! SEE YOU SOON BOI!
Ty : tbf Arteta was planning his tactics against Ronaldo
Lee is correct
"He didn't even touch him!" lol
Remember, Emery brought Saliba. Not Arteta!
Lee chats rubbish I’m sorry I’d love to debate with him about arteta slyly weirdly
The longer he talks he got anger louder wow this man piss off
To get the owner out please buy no tickets to the games, and no gears.
Ty: personally I think that peps clothes had a huge affect on the player’s concentration
2:06 Top player Gundelan
Voldemort looking ass 🤣
The funny thing is fans dont realise they wrote this game off. Thats why they aint playing. What we do need is a baller like Arour someone who can get some service.
Ty: "Atleast Leno made about 12 saves, which will improve him."
Arsenal fans calling ole a p.e teacher, arteta what is he now 😂😂😂
Why is robbie not doing these interviews ffs???
Arteta is the gift that keeps giving us joy
Arteta 🗑
Lee is 100% correct
Ty: if you flip the table we’re actually in first place
Arsenal were lucky to get away with 5-0.  MUFC have just signed CR7, obviously he's expected to score goals but he is a consummate professional, he works very hard to be as good as he is and continues to be in his 30's. He will inspire the MUFC youngsters. Who will do that at Arsenal, any one who would stand up "conflicts" with Arteta and is sidelined and binned? He knows Pep G and his game, if his Arsenal can't give them a game then ....
I don't think any coach will take this team
I love this 🤩
Our process of concentrates on youth players sucks let Arteta coach QPR's youth academy
When Ty shows anger & start to raise his voice😂😂😂😂🙌
Ty : At least we improved from the  10 years ago 8-2 against united.
Bringing new yes man manager/coach would make any difference the fans had their chance to have their voice heard last week and we bottled it. The problem is the owners they made our club below top six and is only getting worse if we carry on being soft and passive
Arteta is the worst manager ever in the EPL...He's an Idiot, Arteta OUT OUT OUT!!!!
That vein on his head is gonna pop any minute
I keep hearing Arteta has a plan....I'm not an arsenal fan but this guy has no plan. He doesn't play to his strengths. Sends the likes of saliba and Martinez out. Changes week in week out. I'm lost.
These players lost there balls
I'm starting to feel sorry for Curtis because he had to put up with the yelling and scolding
Its the defending. 3 games 0 goals...
United Chelsea Liverpool would beat city simple as common sense sit back and hit them on the break
Lee “I’m gonna say this now “ judges
Trust the process arteta in all day, next year championship😜😜✊🏿😜😜😜
I'm loving it.......🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I always say be grateful when getting 4th place each season on a crappy budget. I can remember when all of you saying Wenger as no ambitions saying 4th is like a trophy. Cow neva know the use of him tail til when fly tek him.
ARTETA OUT !
2:05 Gundoland 😂😂
100% Lee he played wenger signings as a new manager to show what you want from your team you play your signings and yet mari didnt play, tavares didnt play pathetic all over
The players are the problem not the coach you have done this to Wenger and emery
I've been patient about Arteta up to this point but today was it for me. He has to go, they're a rudderless ship that's crashed onto a reef.
The club needs waking up, the players need waking up, a fresh direction for everyone.... Conte.
where’s dt
Lee: It's my birthday today I'm going to be calm.   Lee after the game: Voldemort rage.
To watch Arsenal this season, is to DIE OF HEART ATTACK!!!!!
Bring back ozil lol
I predicted 6-0 so a great result for the arse bahahaaaa
Arsenal fans don’t deserve this? I remember the wenger out? And anyone else since out. You didn’t know what you had with wenger.
Getting pathetic how they keep blaming the manager meanwhile the squad is absolute trash 🤦‍♂️😂
Cancel Saliba’ Loan and bring him back
Emery got the job over arteta, he was no good so we hire arteta 😒
Ty: Man City beat Liverpool 5-0 and in 2 years they won the league so we have to stay positive
7 shots on target in the last 3 epl matches get that hell of a coach out of our club
Birthday greetings to you Lee. Hopefully more birthdays will be happy 😃
Please don’t sack arteta
gonna put it out there again. 3 games, 0 goals.
Lee sounds like a angry P.E teacher 🤣🤣
1 shot in the game  19% possession  0 corners and this coming from an Arsenal team that has always been known for quick one/two touch pass and move all out attacking football with an half decent defence and possession type football out playing  teams ..... today was a fcukin DISGRACE to see and Artetta has to go for the sake of the real fans not ty 1 and ROBtyBIE 2
Arteta has to face up to it now before he does this club anymore damage . Leave now .
damn.... my man has witnessed arsenal lose 8-2 and 5-0 on his birthday
Torreira and guendouzi shipped out to keep xhaka and eleny arteta really trying to screw us over, plus willock, saliba loaned out 2 seasons in a row and instead he picked mustafi, holding, Chambers, mari, Luiz and kolasinac makes no sense, started off ruining  the club when he decided against making martinez number 1 and sold him
Lee getting louder and louder during the course of the interview is why hes the greatest
If Arsenal get relegated can they make a come back or will stay in the championship
Lord Valdamort Is getting angry
Be careful what you ask for.  That happened to the previous manager.  In Arteta Arsenal trust. Give 10 year contract. TRUST the process.
Trust the process. in 5 years time this team will only lose 4-0 to city. thats progress
There were a few edits, what did lee say I wonder 😂😂
🤣
Arsenal need Ronaldo 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Arsenal away fans celebrated City's 4th goal today. We need to change our managet today because we will get relegated.
Here’s some hope for you to hold onto: on fifa 21 this week I lost my first three games of the season with AC Milan. Those were the only three losses of the entire season, in which I won the league. What I’m saying is, Arsenal aren’t AC Milan and you’re going to get relegated.
Dam it's Lee's birthday aswell Brutal ARSENAL are finished and have been finished since end of Wenger's era
And yet you guys keep paying to go watch the match... Smh
We should have sacked him when he played a false9 against Villareal in the Europa league.
I'm almost glad that Claude (RIP) is not around to witness this. Now plan for Arteta's replacement. It's Time To Go.
I would hate to be interview by Cecil with that smirk on his face all the time. I can swear he loves a defeat.
Happy birthday Lee and you said what i was thinking straight
Don't know if you've been watching... This has been going on for 10 years.
I think Mari is dealing with PTSD from Lukaku last weekend 😂
COACH VS LENO ALL PROBLEM
Sack Arteta
5ft4 midgets bullying is  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Lee judges is too much man 😂😂😂😂
Been supporting since 1970 & this is one if not the most feckless team ever
Ty was having a go at Carragher and Neville a few days ago with his arrogance , where is Ty now ??
3:19 defo said something outrageous
Didn't somebody say that Aubameyang is back?
Sack him ! And get conte in !
Bring in Big Sam.
Pure theatre 🎭
In all seriousness tho, I really feel for everyone surrounding the club...it can only get better🙏🏾
Arsenal just keep getting worse and worse and worse. And I’m loving it
This might be nothing. But I thought I saw mari argue with arteta- I think in the chelsea match. Maybe that's why he was dropped.
Trust the process!!!! In Arteta we trust!!! Gunner Army stand up!!!!!!!
Its obviously a personal thing with Arteta and Saliba. Its nothing to do with Saliba not being ready, its Arteta having a face on.
Too good to go down 🤔😩😵‍💫
Amazon documentary gonna be lit
The most reckless thing here is the fact this knobhead went from possible sale to new contract and captain when everyone knows he's an average player and a world class liability. Not even a gunner but that was awful to watch.
Lee is a massive flip flop
Loan saliba. Loan guendouzi. Loan torreira.  Didn’t let ozil play a single minute last season. This guy ruined this club every single minute when he camed.
ARSENAL ARE DEAD ...
You guys should re-sign David Luiz - that would make this the complete comedy show.
ARSENAL ARE DEAD ...
I asked myself from day 1, what criteria did they use to hire Arteta? And why is he still at post
Totally agree Lee
I've said all along, if you want to be the best you get the best. But are owners are running this club into the ground. We will appoint another clown and will be doing this again in 18 months this will continue until the owners leave.
Watching arsenal at the moment feels like the real managers had a touchline ban and the assistant's filling in
Kroenke out. Arteta out.
Ben white watching thinking why did I sign for this club, Pepe ain’t sick he knew this was coming,
Something needs to  change asap with arsenal how we losing 2-0 to brentford 2-0 to Chelsea and 5-0 to man city today we need a new manager in now!!!!
Thank you Lee for speaking for all us Arsenal fans. Get Mikel out, Get the owners out
Seen better defending at my local pub team it's the worst manager and team I have seen in 60 years as an arsenal supporter if we don't get an experienced manager very soon we are going down why did we leave Highbury for this rubbish
Happy Birthday Lee 🎂 👏
Omg this is funny. So happy im not a fan of ur small club.
Leno made great saves to stop it from being 10 nil but Arsenal go and spend 25 million on a reserve keeper 😂🤣
CHELSEA fans : We support chelsea and we’ve already won 2 cups this year 🏆🏆  ARSENAL fans : We support arsenal but this is the only cup we’re getting this year ☕️💩
28/08/2011 Man Utd 8 - 2 Arsenal  28/08/2021 Man City 5 - 0 Arsenal  not much has changed for Arsenal in a decade!
Well I said arsenal would lost 6-0 guess I was one off😂😂😂😂😂
The worst performance Ive seen in English football in years.
AFTV FINDING ALWAYS EXCUSES FOR ARTETA THE CLOWN 🤡..YOU SEE THIS GUY WITH THE MIC...YES BUT YOU KNOW..BEN WHITE ,GABRIEL....ROBBIE AGENDA IS DIFFERENT THAN A REAL ARSENAL FAN...THIS GUY WITH THE MIC IS ROBBIE YES MAN
Park the bus 🤣🤣🤣
Edu + Arteta means disaster.Anyone can see we can't play the City way and we will get nowhere without a decent consistant defence.Been on the cards for 2 seasons. MA has to go.Xhaka ? with or without made no difference,
I'd rather be a hammer than a nail!
This is where Saliba needs to be in there, how do you trust Chambers, Holding, and Cedric to be in. Clueless
I wonder what they edited out lol
The game literally ended after the first goal!
Ty : Man City could have scored 7 to spell Arsenal but only scored 5. That’s a positive for me. Also remember the sun was out and in Lenos face.
TY;WE LOSE BECAUSE WAS RANING 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Forget Disneyland when you can have Gundoland!
Why do you fu——— keep on & on a new manager won’t change anything
It’s bad that Arsenal fans already accepted the lost before the game and still got mad after the game. This is pure comedic.
Big Sam in.
Guess you haven't been watching saliba this season then. No coach can get a player to out jump a smaller person or cover their near post. Simple. There is no one to bring in
We want Ty and Julian 🤣🤣🤣
Big up Lee.happy birthday sir.
Don't cry
Yes!! Take their tears and inject it into my veins. This gives me joy and strength
As the great one said it’s time to go. RIP Claude.
You are funny Lee, but your spot on.
Damn Lee going all out...
I like my steak medium. Not fully done 🤣🤣🤣🤣
That is not how we supposed to loss a game
These dumbs keep on saying arsenal fan don't deserve this n that while they celebrates a win over Westbroom B team bla bla bla....Bunch of clowns deserve every bit of this trash
PEOPLE SUPPORT ARSENAL BUT THIS IS THE ONLY CUP THEY’RE GETTING THIS YEAR ☕️ 😂
Ty. Man City had 11 men on the pitch. Less than half scored. Result.
happy b-day lee  dissapointed we lost
where is DT
S H A M B L E S
Clearly dont understand tactics, its clearly that the players are mediocre, in the first 10 mins arsenal played better u can see arteta’s tactics. After 2 mistakes and 2 goals everything just dropped
The players are the main problem not the manager  They clearly not playing for him.
Ty: it should of been 5-1 that was a penalty
Only Sam Allardyce can save this club.
His anger builds up as the minutes for by  What a joy.
Manscape to shave balls. Hmmm.. 5-0.. all the Arsenal team have no balls. As a Spurs fan, I see you lot with all the passion. You deserve better.
Lee Judges: “bla bla Like bla bla like like bla bla like like like” haha. Happy like birthday like Lee. Like
Saliba probably would have flopped anyway, problem is Arsenal are obsessed with weak players
Ty will be on soon . . . ."well Norwich got beat so we are not rock bottom"
Kroenke  we are excited
When Tanganga is a better defender than your entire team
Bring Koulibaly in at the back to play with Gabriel/White with Saliba and Mavraponos coming back in as well.
Quick question, who on earth would want to manage at Arsenal?!?! 🤣😂
The transfer budget has been blown on bench players! Ramsdale, White, Tavares, Lokonga and Odegaard. All bang average and budget blown! 🤣😂
Wait for TY trying to see how to were the better team and blame the referee
Rival fans right now: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
GUNDOLAN
Not even Harry Potter pissed off Voldemort this much.. Arteta is on another level.
Arsenal gonna become Newcastle 2.0, Willock should’ve just stayed in that case.
Voldemort is angry today! 😂😂
We have more red cards than goals this season, embarrassing
I think Arteta's plan is to get Arsenal relegated so that his boys have a chance to win the Championship and letting them know what it feels like to win a trophy. What a genius.
Wait. Lee. Bro. Did you watch that Chelsea game when Mari played?  He got bullied by Lukaku.
I hate everyone involved sacking wenger
Sign Nat Phillips from Liverpool hes solid at heading the ball out premier league experience wouldn't cost much and Liverpool are looking to sell
Lee’s voice getting louder and louder thru the interview😂 I totally get it though😖😫
Mari is just too slow. Can't you see in the Chelsea game. Being bullied and outplayed.  Lol. Open ur eyes
Happy birthday lee
RIP CLAUDE ♥️🥺
Ian Wright legend but so wrong in calling for Xhaki to stay…….
Not even pub football level, after 15 pints the night before. Stop going on about saliba. The dude isn't here. Talk about players that are here not they are not here.
I’ve been saying Arsenal is just a mid table team for the last 5 years and now I’m realize that i was so wrong...... Arsenal is low table team :))
It’s the players not the manager, the managers have changed but the out come hasn’t. Those players are below average.
Dose Lee rant at his customer's like that when they moan at him
Nobody: Lee:"Gundolan"
If Lee says gundoland then it's gundoland, no more gundogan
Wow.. ok! Erm.. never knew Lee was a heightist…
Pep being nice saying Arteta is a good manager 😂
WE WANT JULIAN
Lee started out calm and then went full rant haha. But at this point, I am not laughing anymore, it's sad for Arsenal fans.
Big Sam is waiting phone call!!
Big up lee tho everytime 💯
Arsenal In the mud is the funniest thing ever
Wheres DT ?
Banters aside, Happy Birthday Lee …!!!
Arsenal players have lost their confidence
None of these players seem to know or truly feel what Arsenal f.c stands for! Wonder how many of them have walked around the old highbury stadium or even finsbury park ..the traditions are lost! they do not even seem to care when their losing ..no fight..just frozen flight.
Lmaooo at “Goondalan”
I love when Lee judge grinds his teeth 😂😂😂
Everyone from the manager to the players should return their wages for the last 3 weeks. Not one of them deserve a penny
I love lee but what's the point in wasting your breath saying he needs to max the decision to leave the club cos we know he won't do that will he. agree with everything else tho big up lee happy birthday
It’s all good tho xhaka does his talking on the pitch so don’t worry😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
They had to cut some parts so YouTube won’t take them down 😭😭😭
😂😂😂
"Incompetence Level" Lool this is tough Arteta really should do the right thing now and resign it's embarrassing
AFTV is one of the best comedy channels on YT
The Rise in his anger through the video is sooo funny 😅😂😂😂😂😂
Lee is the most unlucky arsenal fan. He witnessed 5-0 and 8-2 on his birthday
the only  process is sabotage
Arteta was always a gamble from day one. Thought we were getting a mini guardiola ended up getting a knock-off. Time to go!!!
Kroenke please get out of arsenal 🙏
you should never, slag off the fans who attend every match, they travelled all that way, if they wanted to clap and applaud, well done to them, part of the team!
Ty : Life is all about how look at things and if you turn the table around we're actually on top .
No more excuses, please.
The gulf in class between us and West Brom’s kids was the same gulf in class today between city and our first team. It’s scary. I was at the game today and City are on another planet to us.
They say quitting is never a good thing unless it's drugs but they forgot about Arsenal. Am no longer following Arsenal on anything, Done.
I hope Robbie is paying Lee the most 🤣🤣
As Chelsea fan I completely understand the argument here, I watched the match and the pattern was same as when we were under lampard , like it was clearly visible that Mikel arteta just doesn’t know what he doing , and clubs are not schools for managers to learn and develop like some people say about arteta , Arsenal need a proper manager asap
It’s like they don’t know how to play football. Total train wreck.
man i wish we can see DT post match reaction....would be out of this world....
It still amazes me how Arteta survived after finishing 8th last season and getting knocked out of the Europa League by Villarreal.
Arteta out!!!! Fire the cone boy.
Ty: Thoughts and prayers go out to all the trees that lost their lives in the California wild fires of 1953
‘The defending today was a shambles’
Championship side. End of
The moment i saw auba celebrating like hes won the Ballon D’or against west brom kinda had a feeling arsenal gonna get romped by Man City.   Theyll win a game or 2 and then back to trusting the process again.
Why would Arteta go out with that line up, just why??
If Conte doesn't want it, bring Wenger back, at least I won't be bored every match.
We don't need back 3 or 5 anymore. We need back 10 from now on. Luckily they didn't get CR7 or else what he would do to us today?
I kind of feel sorry for arsenal fans but then remember how they treated wenger they deserve getting relegated
Troops said it months Back then DT didn't want the Arteta out t shirts
What has happened to our club?  Was with Mikel until this game.  Have to see, he's not going to be able to fix this, too inexperienced unfortunately.
Arsenal fans are the most stressful lots when football are supposed to be enjoyed ...lol
Arsenal Fans in 2024: TRUST THE PROCESS 😂💀
What I don´t understand is, when Xhaka gets a deserved red card and puts the whole team in jeopardy for the rest of the game, Arteta stands up from his chair and gives him a supportive pat!!! Is like, "well done"! Perplexing.
Goal of the month is meant to be for your own team unless its Arsenal
Julian “on the plus side (insert deluded comment here)”
How Mari suddenly injured when I saw him on the bench during the West Brom game? Why our defenders always missing from the team just before the games like Ben and Mari?
Arteta is the reason why Arsenal find themselves in the position they are now, Xhaka and El Neny are deadwood how he kept them and sold Willock completely baffles me.. Clown of a manager 🤡🤡
Wenger, Emery, Arteta... The problem is always the players (and the board, the agents).
i think people just want to see some passion. ok its against Man City but if you go watch say Brentford or even Norwich who also lost 5-0 Norwich atleast had a go and was just undone by a much better team, thats not the case in the current Arsenal team they just dont have a go at all.
People say arteta done how can you be done when you’ve never been good
I actually feel sorry for Lee, he’s a proper fan and he looks dejected.  This is coming from a Spurs fan. Arsenal are an absolute disgrace.
Mark my words This is our last defeat of the season  City, United, Chelsea, Liverpool we are coming for you 🔫
😂😂😂😂
well said lee, but we all know it won't happen.  arteta will stay and xhaka will start again as soon as possible. 10th place finish this year is optimitic
I think AFC earn more from the media attention they receive after a loss than from tickets or merch...You'd think that these tactics and performances were written into their contracts...honestly 😠
Deadest Club!!!
Arsenal super league team.
Where is Mr. DT in the last weeks? Does he meanwhile support an other club?
Why this fella not going games anymore?? And DT Wer the old guard aftv
Ty won't have the balls to comment on this match. Even with the Manscaped sponsor.
Gundoland 😙😀😀
Can we all start a "Leeeeeeeeeeeeeeee" chant?
Alright ball sack calm down, Arteta IN!!
Ty “if you do a headstand we’re top”
This is what happen when you celebrate 6-0 against west brom kids
Gundaland😂😂
Please bring in Big Sam as long I don't have to see Arteta's face anymore.
*To all Arsenal fans:  Buckle up!
Ty scraping that kewi would done better. Happy birthday Lee bring back Wenger, Emery even Graham
Gunduland 😂😂
Arteta out
Arteta out
“5”4 midgets doing it to us” 😂😂😂😂😂
So true. Incompetence level
Shambles FC
Arsenal couldn't have gift-wrapped a more splendiferous birthday present for Lee if they tried!
TY: there was lot of sunshine as it was 1230 kickoff and the sun was in players eyes.
Would a new manager make a difference cause it’s the same players
Its all part of the process guys...
Keep drinking Lee
Arteta out
Ty: I want to thank the NHS first this happen. The players at least modelled the kit today too
Arteta out
ARTETA OUT !!!
Why the hell let young and hungry defender like saliba go on loan twice when ur defence is the weakest part of the team ??? absolutely disgraceful!!
Arteta out
edu  Mikel Arteta out
Can't wait for Julians interview..
Ty: “Robbie I know we’re bottom of the table but if you flip that around we’re actually top”.
Poor Johnny sins!
Arteta plizz go
Be patience... Every big clubs have up and down. Trust Arteta and we can get top 8 again in the end of season. If u are real Arsenal fan now its time to stay behind your team. Believe and on day Arsenal Will become big club again. Just wait and see
Happy birthday Lee. Great interview.
“5’ 4” midgets doing it to us” 😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭
Man City defenetely weren't West Brom II  : ))))
Guendouzi over xhaka too !
Man City hammering Arsenal once again..  Lee(grinding his teeth): "you dirty bastards you've done it again!"
Respect the judge
Small tinpot finished club😂😂
Having Manscapped sponsoring this channel is funny, City went balls deep into assenal
Arteta! The gift that keeps on giving!
Happy Birthday Lee, have a good one!
Fone the police!!arse-nil got raped in manny 🥺 and best of all …..MENDY has a alibi,hez on remand!!!😜🤣😂🤪
Watch Robbie come up with his mitigating circumstance bs..
Shocking I’m embarrassing to be an arsenal fan disgusting. They say he need time he’s had 18 months enoughs enough arteta out
Ty" let's be honest Robbie,we will atleast qualify for championship,it sounds almost like champions league"
Players are clueless. Shows that the match preparation was non existent. No plan b. Smith row is our 10… what else to expect
Ty: “Yeah they score 5 today but we score 6 a few days ago so we pretty much score 1 goal more than them”
arsenal fans should just lower their expectations and support the team like Ty does. All this moaning led to Wenger gettin' fired and look what you have now.
As a wise man once said, "IT'S TIME TO GO!"
Arteta delivered Arsenal to Mancity for slaughter. His hate for Saliba and Ozil is paying dividends now.
no one wants to see this. Put on Robbie wth DT hahahaha
Happy Birthday Lee!
Whose waiting for Ty’s excuse ?
Knowing Arsenal, we will miss out on Conte and keep Arteta and sign a bang average manager after he goes.
Arsenal have no goal to submit for goal of the month😭🤣🤣
Nothing but facts
@AFTV - sacked arteta NOW !!! get CONTE IN NOW !!!
💉 it
We spent £130M and I swear that was the same team as last year plus Kola.   How can we spend £130M and the only new face is an old player we already had… 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
TY…”The FA need to introduce a purple coloured card for two footed tackles, 5 purple cards = a sending off.  The FA Association are working against us.”
Julian : Being top or bottom of the league is all about perspective. If you look upside down, we are top of the league 😄
I totally forgotten about Mari. Yeah, where is him? Is he injured?
3:19  A mysterious edit. What did Lee say?
Who else is waiting for Arteta to get offered a new contract now lol
we all feel the same way Lee, sorry they ruined your birthday
Arteta Masterclass 👌
We just got battered 5 0 and the first thing i see is manscaped. Fk this channel
I watch The Proms every year and I've never seen a crescendo like that
Happy Birthday 🎂
Where's that loud mouth DT hiding now !
WHEN’S IT GOING TO END, WOBBIE
The Premier league has to step in cz that display was a disgrace...
Me: Patiently wait for Ty interview. maybe he will blame Taliban this time. 🤣
happy 21st birthday lee 🎂🎉
Happy birthday judge!
If ty comes in here and doesn’t speak the truth. Then he is a lair. He is a coward if he can’t speak the truth and say how bad Arsenal has become. It’s a joke for someone who claims to be honest to talk like a child. The gunners are hands down a bottom tire team now. Sad sad stuff.
This is the result of signing average players. Well, let's continue to trust the process.
Lee ngl you been way to nice recently, like today you need to be more straight to the point stop giving everyone time
*HE'S DONE IT AGAIN!!!* Birthday wishes to The Judge :D
Kolasanic was not the best defender!!!! But happy birthday Lee
Do I have permission to leave and go and support Liverpool guys?
Hey, I got the same birthday as Lee! The only positive thing to come out of today 😭😭😭
Ozil tweeted "Trust The Process 💔 😥"
Ty: We didn't concede under 14 seconds the last time we played MAN CITY . We are making Progress
Lee is a legend
4:56 wait for the grind
Arsenal at least won 6 5 on aggregate this week 👍🏻
Can we deep that Pep came out and said he’s a good manager 😭 I’m ded
AC Milan all the way. Screw Arsenal.
Ty " The grass was green "
Happy Birthday Lee, so sorry Bro😔
Ty:we musnt forget that it was sunny it affected the players
The ö in özil has more points ffs
Wenger In.
Julian " This was practice for Norwich "
Ty: Who needs Champions League when you have the privilege to play in the Championchip next year!
IAN WRIGHT said it on camera that he doesn't understand the formation, style of play/pattern. If someone still says Arteta in... Do they understand better than Ian Wright.?
Arsenal got rapped and mendy wasn’t even playing
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ty:10yrs ago we conceded 8 goals,today we conceded 5.Our defence is progressing,so give Arteta time,soon he will lead us to the Championship.
Chambers , holding , Cedric, all won’t even make Everton Tottenham bench
It’s Lee’s birthday too 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 man’s blood pressure on 100 😭😭😭😭😭
Trust the process. All going according to plan.
Happy birthday  Lee. Enjoyed your arsenal defeat again !!
Arteta is in his 3rd season and he's still experimenting with the tactics and the squad! Need to get him out ASAP even for a rookie it's pathetic.
Lee: It’s my 21st birthday. Look what Arsenal are doing to me!
Ty- we used all our monthly goals on West Brom
Why do arsenal fans think conte will go there? He left inter Milan because he wasn’t going to be backed and because of the owners, there’s no way he’d consider arsenal
first time i’ve seen an edit on one of these fan cams, did the Judge start crying😧
Ty: "Man City had 25 shots and only scored 5 of them. That's a positive"
Enough of ranting , do a united style protest and show the owners they  fkn can't get away with it !
Ty: If you flip the Table round Arsenal would be top of the League! 🙂
In 2004, Arsenal made a history with 0 lose, and now they’re also about to make a history with 0 win👏
He said the same last season :)
Love how lee starts off calm and then slowly builds up his anger
Big Sam is available
Arsenal are title contenders, yes, they had a bad start, but if they stick with Arteta, in my books, they are title contenders. Yes it's going to be tough, there are a lot of good clubs, but i still think that Arsenal will win the championship
TY : There is a 1+ goal difference from today's game and the west brom game so trust the process!
What a great day it is!
Can't believe lee gets this shambles on his birthday  Feel bad for the guy
To all Arsenal fan listen, in all my years as football and Arsenal fan I've never seen a coach tactically better than Mikel Arteta and I think he's the best coach we ever have had. Back him and trust the process. We can still do this! We are Arsenal! COYG!
Well  well  well
At least we don't need to be put through this for another 2 weeks.😂
Who seen ozil tweet 😳
"XHAKA IS A KEY PART OF MY PLANS" - MIKEL THE🤡
Urgently get Antonio Conte!!!
What has arsene Wenger got to do with us losing, just make ur voice clear and stop looking for where to dumb ur anger
Waiting for julian and ty😂😂😂😂
Ty: we played on the 28/8 before and lost 8-2, we played again on the 28/8 and only lost 5-0, so that’s an improvement
Give arteta time come on guys it’s only been 3 games. Also Arsenal have +1 goal difference this week. Be positive guys
Tbh, I predicted 10-0. But atleast it didn't go that bad
Xhaka is the best of a bad bunch
Arteta out tonight
Ty: we may be 20th but we won the FA Cup. Trust the process
Robbie: “Ty, another loss for Arsenal, what did you make of that?”  Ty: “Yeah, yeah, it’s disappointing but (insert ref or weather excuse)”
The real entertainment has started
wheres DT that moist bre
Arteta in 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 banter fc
🎧 Ty: It's alright, our goal difference is +1. 6-0 v West Brom, 0-5 v Man City. Im proud of the boys. 🎧
Trusting the process at bottom of the league 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
It's only Lee's 18th birthday today too, look what Arsenal are doing to the man.
Good man Lee happy bday bro. Bottom of the league thanks Arsenal
Everything is garbage. Arteta out now !
take your time widditttt
Trust the process
arsenal are a banter club. this is so jokes.
Lose to brentford = Angry Lose to Chelsea = Sad Lose to Man City = LMAO We are officially a comedy club. Trust the process. We will win the league next year.               The championship league
Arteta is a Genius! He had a Vision to win Arsenal the Championship! And its gonna happen, the capitulation of West Brom was a thing of beauty!
big up lee- he talks facts!!
Ty: this week we won 6-5 on aggregate
*(Rant)*
Hope Voldemort invests in a good gum shield soon or he’s gonna lose them teeth, long grind of a season for his gnashers coming up
I’m sorry there’s no excuse anymore. He’s done. Starting kola, resigning granit, getting rid of saliba. HES CLUELESS
Anyone else refreshing their channel like crazy?
Giving this Man (Arteta) this much Excuses shows Arsenal's Lack of ambition as a Club, When He should've been sacked since Last season.
Championship team at best
Assemble RAT ARMY! 🐀
Get Bob the builder in 🔨
He’s done it again that arteta
First!
lol
