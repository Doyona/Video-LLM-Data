Solluminati is the reason I started YouTube. He’s the only youtuber who stayed true to himself and grew even more. He has the balls to expose the industry, freemasonry, and genuinely understands how global politics works. All at the same time he’s still beasting at hoops, YouTube, and spirituality.
Holy hell did folks forget what à box out is?
he has no moves jk get buckets
45 and 41 has never been done b4💪🏾
This is exactly how you bounce back 💪🏾

Stay strong my bro god is with you 🙏🏾
Yo So, I lost a friend of mine a couple years ago that I’ve known for my entire life. He was always like a big brother to me, so I can sort of understand the pain you must be going through right now. Take all of the time you need man, the healing process is something that absolutely can not be rushed. Spend time with your family, be there for them and let them be there for you. Good luck man, I know you can get through this and can bounce back stronger than ever.
Yo bruddah just wanted to salute your strength and your vulnerability to speak on your lost loved one and share it with your fans. It’s says a lot about your character salute to you and keep grinding. You motivate kings who do not have the focus and drive to achieve better. Just wanted you to see this eventually. Maintain your strength and control and they can’t touch you.
Man RIP to your brother man I honestly can’t even fathom it
nigga forgot his pants !!!!
So active on them boards fr   RIP TRILLER
GAYZER
God loves u man 😢
Made me cry watching this big bro. I’m so happy for you. You saved my life bro you got 2 million brothers now ❤

Rip Triller fr shit like that heartbreaking hope you pull through it man
Praying for you and your family bro 🙏🏾
So, has created the best family audience. since I could remember there was a reason you weren't hitting that milly back then and thats because thats not the audience you was made to build..like I remember disliking so much back then because of the audience you were based around. Your are really my top inspiration due to actually caring about my health and helping me start seeing things for what they really are. Greatest Of All Time in my books. One day I wish to give you a run for your money in basketball, but until then..
hope u feel better soon bro
SHIFTIN THRU DIFERENT MULTIVERSES AND UNIVERSES IS JUST ABOUT LETTING GO MY BRO, SPIRITUAL SO. 😱😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🔥. I KNOW U LOST YOUR BROTHER BRO, BUT HE WAS NEVER YOURS IN REALITY AND IN ACTUALLITY.  *I HAVE BEING SHIFTING FOR REAL THROUGH PARALEL UNIVERSES FOR A MONTH NOW, AND BRO FOR REAL REAL, THERE ARE INFINITE OTHER YOUS THAT DOESNT EVEN HAVE A BROTHER MY G.  ANYWAYS MY BRO SOONER THAN LATER U'LL GET TO EXPERIENCE IT. LOVE YOU FOR REAL, WORKER OF THE LIGHT 'SPIRITUAL SO'😊😄😄✌📍📍📍  DONT LET THEM GET TO YOU, BY AFFECTING THOSE ARROUND YOU BRO.  DONT FORGET,  YOUR BROTHERS AND MY BROTHERS ARENT ACTUALLI YOURS NOR MINES,  BUT REALLY ONLY BROTHERS.👋🏽👋🏽👋🏽👋🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  THAT'S THE ONLI HURTING, BUT LIBERATING TRUTH MY BRO.  *ITS ALL BOUT LETTING GO OF ALL ATTACHMENTS.  CUZ THERE IS ACTUALLY INFINITE 'SPIRITUAL SO'. AND THATS A REAL FACT, REALLY  REALLY, REALLY.  THE ONLI THING THAT THOSE OTHER YOUS HAVE IN COMMON BRO, IS THAT YOU ARE ALL DA SAME (SOUL) OF THE SAME SPIRIT••• ANYTHNG ELSE IS DIFERENT, (EVEN THE MINDS) Of The Soul. (AND THE BODIES) Of The Minds FOR SURE.
Sorry for your loss So,  Also would like to let you know that your brother is not upset about you feeling low and saddened by his death. You’re grieving , and sadness is an emotion that comes with grief, no one is judging you for being vulnerable, you deserve grace and space to take in the loss of your brother. You do not have to be strong right now, just exist… and let all your emotions flow whether it be anger, sadness, confusion etc. There is no right or wrong way to grieve , but just know that we all see and hear you. Time heals all wounds, once again i am so sorry for your loss and may God continue to place angels over you and your family to console you through this sudden loss.
go crazy so
Keep your head up so🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
99 overall So
I didnt even finish your last video yet but thank you soo much for that. its okay not to be okay. i just lost my brother this year too a few months ago and it does hit different. i just want you to know that i understand you and the hurt and anger. Pls keep going for him. Everything reminds me of him. EVERYTHING. and its bitter sweet. Just keep his memories alive 🫶🏽 and Long Live your brother !
Stay Strong brother ❤
Aye So keep your head up WE LOVE YOU MAN!! Ik ur brother on ur shoulder right now
Damn So 🥹🙏🏾 RIP Gawd Triller 🕊
sorry man you clowned a suicidal kid on your channel and you think we gon care bout ur fam. shits hard but karma hit you crazy broski
RIP BRO, I KNOW YOUR BROTHER WANTS YOU TO KEEP FIGHTING AND STAY STRONG HOMIE. IM SORRY MAN😭
Sorry for your lost man
to the fans who came back from his brothers video to comment your peace I love you ♥️
Rip gawd triller I’m sorry for your loss bro it’s always okay to show emotion we all love you and here for you dawg you will always be an inspiration to me family take as much time to heal and recover from this ❤️
Just watched your newest video and the comment section is blocked so ima say it to you here. Its ok to cry bro. He wouldnt be mad or upset with you. Crying just shows the real love you had for em. And the real pain. Its ok lil bro. Im a lil bit older than you and since we are human beings, unfortunately we dont get to live forever whether it be by father time or a accident or by something evil. Life sucks so bad during those times of loss. Ive been through a few of my own family members passings and ive always found that talking with others and showing emotions helps versus talking with others about it and forcing yourself to not let those emotions out and go. Im the strong silent type just as im sure you are as well but dont let your pride as a man or ego deter you from releasing some of those emotions. Cuz if you hold it all in it can break your spirit and take you down a dark path thats even harder to get off of. Your a smart guy. I know you understand already. Just trying to help out. Stay up bro. Stay positive. And stay grounded.
I LUV YU BRUDDA💚
sorry to hear about your bro, sending positivity, hope the light overpowers the dark ❤
God loves you man!
Condolences to you and your family brother🙏🏾
praying for you bro
My best friend since 6th grade middle school died in 9th grade summer we played 2k every day with my other friends smoked went to six flags a few months before he was shot and I’m 20 now and it hurts To this day can’t imagine losing someone this close
his recent video make me cry bro … never seen SO like this 💔
RipGawdTrill literally just changed my GamerTag bc I don’t know any other way to show my respect smh I’m so hurt my anxiety is so high bc I really truly fucked with bro I used to tell everybody my glass cleaner better than Gawd trill that’s how much I respected him and his skill
This is to you so i never like to comment but i want to tell you this   It's going to be very tuff when you lose a love one especially when your spiritual some people think when your  Spiritual/Woke you can't have no feelings for the dead that's not true. No matter how woke you are no matter how Spiritual you are A person your close to no matter if they are a bot passes you will feel sad it's normal. When you overcome it you will do better in life you will bounce back and that love one death will push you to even more high points, what i mean is they will boost your rate cause you do it for them. Make them happy and you happy when it's your time always remember no matter what you are.... Your still a live breathing human being on earth your no different from anyone stay strong this is from Makari  I will never forget this Post no matter what
God gives his battles to his strongest soldiers 1 love so Ima make sure to spread love and positivity through the world ❤️
We love u so, sorry for your loss bro 🕊 stay positive
Praying for u to get through it with the passing of triller man I can’t imagine the pain plz just get better so we will always be here to support

Why you turn your comments off????? Let me ask you something is the Illuminati real and if it is did you sacrifice your brother? I been studying gematria for years nows and I see how everything adds up when it comes to these “Famous Celebrities”. Solluminati your not fooling me man I already see the bs that’s going on just admit it your working with the elites.
We love you bro keep yo head up I don’t wanna speak to much on it but ik trust❤️
Hey So, Just watched the video you just posted just wanted to tell you there’s thousands of us praying for you I know your a spiritual person but you’ve helped me through so much and to see you this torn up hurts me too from the bottom of my heart I know your brother is watching you from a higher place and proud of you I’ll be keeping you in my prayers stay strong brother🙏
Damn Mann I’m sick about your baby boy it hurt to watch that video but I remember you said all these people talking about smoking niggas packs and being Dishonorable stay here and all the good heart felt people is Dying because god or higher source takes there strongest Soldiers they don’t want these weak ass hearted and minded people Rest In Peace to your brother 💕💕💐 just remember he would wanna see you win and Continue inspiring for him nothing hurts like a lost life my heart go out to you unconditionally.
SO you got all our support and me personally I recently lost my father so I know the pain of losing someone you love and are close to and you gotta know it’s okay to cry even if the person wouldn’t want that, we all gotta suffer in this life but god can push us through it brother ❤

Stop crying on YouTube for sympathy about a death while claiming said dead person wouldn’t want you to do exactly that. Go see a fucking therapist. Talk to your family and stop fishing for clout behind a man’s death.

You need to learn gematria! Yeah you sacrificed your brother, remember there is a day where we will all stand before the judge of the universe, choose where you'll spend eternity by either trusting in Christ or rejecting Him, you only have yourself to blame if you choose the latter.

Where are you going after you die Heaven or Hell ? Jesus Christ is the answer, He said that “He is the way the truth and the life. He is the only Savior. Come to Jesus and He will fill you and you will be saved and your name will be written in the Lambs book of Life. Repent and believe in Jesus Christ. Other religions are false, they cannot save you only Jesus Christ can save.Jesus said “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” Matthew 11:28-30. “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” Acts 4:12. Put your trust in Jesus Christ
This nigga said "A" league🤣 not "The"

Turn to Jesus people he died for your sins, Repent of what the New Testament describes as sin. Believe the gospel obey the teachings of Jesus documented in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Jesus is the only way to be saved, be baptized if you have faith in Jesus then you will live life with him as your example. If you need prayer i'll pray for you. If you want to keep contact with a brother in Christ i’ll keep contact with you. The love of God is beyond our understanding. God bless.,.,.

You can definitely ball on average players who are 5’10”. Go ball on some nba rookies and some college seniors where you will have a lot less space to work with better defense and where the skill level is a little more even. 🤷🏾‍♂️

Oh you thought I wouldn't pause on them stats huh. Every game was a blowout. What so about 6'3? Averaging 20+ reb a game? 0.53% ft. 19 ast to 10 TO. I'm not trying to sound like a hater but the competition had to be trash.

Every goat in history seperated themselves from the sheep that surround him.  Time to yourself can open eyes you didn't know could see .  Time to yourself gives you the opportunity to upgrade your character.  You spend all of that time grinding "2k",   Why not do it in real life ?   Cut the crap and grind, meditate, and become better.  So has given you an example...  Do you understand ?
Nice

One hundred and ninety-four ponts, one hundred and thirty-four rebounds, and nineteen assists great Career Stats. So should be added to the Generation of Miracles, Rakuzan, or Vorpal Swords. I need to join a basketball league or shogi league. This was inspiring. Thank you for sharing So.

John 3:36  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Romans‬ ‭6‬:‭23 Jesus Christ is the only way, seek Him while He may be found, before it’s too late, tomorrow is never promised.
