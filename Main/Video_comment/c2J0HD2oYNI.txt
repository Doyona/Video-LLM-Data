Miss seeing guys like Larry legend in the 3 point contest
I swtg KAT was missing one point from his score
king steph
They need to go back to the old rules in sports.
A whole rack of 2 point balls. And random 3 point balls. That’s whack rules. Leave the game alone man. Goodness
Trae was ahh
We need Dame, Steph & Klay before they retire.
Why do they even have this contest they already doing it in every nba game to see who could shoot more 3s then Steph but we all know they ain't Steph
It's dam time ⏲️
Por que curry no participo?
Yall talking bout lillard im tryna find out who dat in da white dress 😂😂😂😂😂 17:30
everybody score 20+ damn 3 was close to 26 too sheesh
9:51 “The deeper it is the better it is for him too.” -Kenny Ayoo Pause lmao 😂😂
Don't lie. Herro won 3 point contest..
Can someone explain this court to me
It’s not that Halliburton’s form is ugly that bothers me, it’s that when he shoots it I can never tell if it’s going in or not lol
it is interesting to see how the total point inflation since 90s frist there was only 25 points. now I dont know even how many points there.
I just pulled up the 3-point contest again because I was bored as shit, and of course as usual, Steph fanboys be bringing him into this. I like him but like how is that currently relevant.😭
Lije if you trynna get a estimate projections for round 1 parlays 😂😭
tray young is the poor man's Steph Curry somehow
At 3:33 they didn't count KATS POINT
Chef Curry did not participate¿ why¿
Look at the many cheating done by the referee,,He saw someone step on the line during the shoot but he didn't blow the whistle.,,,,@NBA#NBA is idiots
Who else putting parlays for Millard?
BORING, we see this every game, that why they have lost millions of fans
Very much advertising
10:28 is so clutch from Dame
He got this, he's a winner earnie (Missed Shot).....OOOH!!!! NOOO he's isn't
No one sees that at 13:09 Lillard still had the ball in his hand after the buzzer... They robbed kat and trae
Lamelo e Would have won
curry dosn't exist
Curry : I  didn’t come so he ain’t a winner 😂
who was curry ??
This year Jokić will win this..😅
ananızı s…. 2 dk ya bi reklam koyulurmu
Jesus Christ is King.
15:52
Still Steph Is The Number One.
Damian Also Do the Dame Time. In 3PT Contest. Damn🔥
8.1.0 ₱₱₱₱❤❤❤❤✓$
DAMIAM LILLARD DID NOT GET THAT SHOT OF IN THE TIEBREAKER
Dame's last shot shouldn't have been counted. The time ran out before he released the ball.
The NBA is dead y’all
Curry is the best bro... 😁👍💪🏀
Where is Steph 😢
Let's see Curry VS Dame 2025 !!!
I don't want to hear the announcers during the contest. I only want to hear the crowd noise and the shooter
some of them (a lot of them) have absolutely disgusting form.
This is the greatest 3 point contest ever 🔥💪🏻❤
А кто этих мазил выбрал на контест?😂😂😂😂😂
Foos a traitor & can’t rap to save his own life
Trae Young 1 from 7 attempts to start… yeeesh 😂
11:07 Explain what happened why Trae got stopped.
Since this is for fans, why not invite Anthony Miracola Feb 2025?  Basketball fans demand to know who's truly the best 3p shooter.
Why KAT 24 points becomes 22?
Damn .ice trae.
ajak akhdan bang
DAME TIME 🔥
DAME TIME
fuck YouTube 1 minute into the vid 4 ads already
Dame got lucky this time 🧑‍🍳😂😂 iykyk

Everyone is shit

# young very young
Halliburtons shot looks like one of those Boston dynamics robots
Congrats to Damian Lillard on winning the 3PT shooting contest.
My God I LOVE steph but these comments are gobbling up his dick like its a fulltime job. Yall know 2 things can happen at the same time right? Dame won the 3pt contest and Steph won against Sabrina. Can yall calm down? Jesus, go apply some vaseline to your assholes the way Steph is fucking yall.
And now dame got eliminated in the 1st round. 😂😅
Sabrina shot the same number 😂😂😂wat u talking abt
16:50 my god these commentators are so cringy bro. "sHoOtErs sHoOt" then says "dAmE TiMe DaMe TiMe" as he misses 4 out of 5 shots 🤦‍♀
Stellar
bruh these guys are steph`s victim he can easily win the 3 point contest easily
Boring game ....
Dame proudly holds the trophy
Talk to me, when you find someone as good as Curry. Simply, there WON’T be anyone better than Curry, EVER.👊👍👊
Talk to me, when you find someone as good as Curry. Simply, there WON’T be anyone better than Curry, EVER.👊👍👊
Where is Steph Curry?
Who chose this thumbnail man? Spoiler alert ffs, I know this was weeks ago but still lol
https://youtu.be/Y-hf_8QFhcE?si=WZ1d_iIgIkGj77Gz
Fun Fact: This is the 2nd time Trae Young got owned by Damian Lillard in the Shooting Contest since he previously got owned by Jason Tatum in the Skills Contest.
Congratulations Tyrese Haliburton❤
Wow
Wow
Can we get WNBA vs NBA for next year's all star?
👍
You just know Dame had to do it like that 😂
7 ads in one video wtf
Very nice and interesting
It's interesting how they all shoot the ball differently
Good video
So cute and so fine
cury hiç sevmem ama üçlük yarışında onun eline kimse su dokemez
Nice
thrilling match never mis it
Sabrina is impressive but a smaaller ball makes a difference. There's a bigger basketball made to help shots and handles. cant say shes better than dame but she is raw . I still admire her
Wow
Crazy how a center got second
ICE TRAEEE, LET'S GO HAWKSSS! #TrueToAtlanta
DAME DOLLA 💲🔥
https://youtu.be/Yvec4TKgB_0
Wow nice one 🎉
People just don’t know how good of a shooter Lillard is 🔥
one of the best 3pt contest ever.
Where is Luka???
Thanks NBA, I missed this and you put the winner in the thumbnail. No point watching it now.
17:25 wow..what a trophy
ice trae throwing bricks
I'd love to see them get rid of gimmick 3-point shot and honestly the money balls altogether. A three-pointer is a three-pointer; Lauri hit 19/27 but loses to KAT who shot 16/27.
why the video stuttering?
👍
🇦🇫
What is #NBA if nomore live on fb. Don't call it National anymore✌🏻
14:00 *pause! Pause!! PASUE!!!* 😂
9:45 *PAUSE!!*
Congratulations to dame  dolla For two trophies in Indianapolis..
best 3-pointer shooter in the league, everyone says steph, but dont act like dame hasnt been right at his neck for multiple seasons, numbers can lie, the ball don't
Garry payton😊
Letsss Gooo Tyrese Halibruton 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The number of ads! Bye bye YouTube
Wow Very nice Nba all Star 2024!!!
👍
Good night
Watched more minutes of adds than the video…
3 point shooter do the slam dunk and dunker plays 3 point shootout
Three-point contests are more interesting than dunk-shid for recent years
karl anthony wasted so much time looking after the ball and going the wrong way around the rack xD
3 point contest is the most exciting part of nha all star weekend. Am I wrong ?
Curry neden yok?
That blonde ref got it goin on
@NBA   Increase your views:  If you put the champion on the thumbnail, about half your viewers will never watch it.   It's a view-killer.
Anyone think the green theme and floor looks horrible?
Hm, weird. I saw people saying Sabrina's 26 wasn't very impressive when the winner hit 26 for the men. Little ass boys always finding a way to hate, lmao.
F
first guy larry bird called him out easy money
Sabrina had more
Wnba 1 nba 0
havent watch 3pt contest in 20 years...  i like that money racket stuff, you basically learn what every player's favorite spot is really nice idea and they dont try to force it like "i dont care which spot you good at there will be a predetermined same spot for everyone"
Sem steph sem audiência 😅
Onde está o steph 😢
bbbbb
bbbjkkkk
😮
That’s the slowest clock ever.. automatic 10 second rewind after the last shot and there’s only 4.5 seconds left lol
Trae Young I feel for him every year
No Durant, Harden and Westbrook? NBA u serious?
Ummmm wtf is starry I WANT SPRITE SPONSOR
Very few 7 Ft+ players shoot the 3 better than Karl Anthony Towns.
Dang KAT shoulda hit his last one
Kenny crazy.
He came back ICE Trae
The numbers of ads on this video is criminal
Dame's last shot should not have counted.
This channel is lucky i wanna see this, cause its RIDICULOUS the amount of ads on each video from this channel. This is why i usually refuse to watch anything here.
If only he tried that hard during games lmfao.
Where Curry?  P.S. Dame Time 🔥Congrats!
How can you guys have those other 2 black guys commenting all they did was Bitch about that poor girl she did alright but Curry is a good shooter next time leave those other 2 jokers off the commentary
@9:50. Major pause 😂😂😂
Wow this was good! The theatrics!
Sabrina could challenged these one 1st......
All I know is everyone who is saying Sabrina is better and protecting Sabrina. Is a Leborn James fan. I’ll just take my time to laugh at you because Leborn got the same amount of rings as Steph. It’s like supporting the women’s best dunker against Leborn it’s not even a competition. Steph is scoring and shooting with men and all stars guarding him literal legends sometimes. I don’t even know who Sabrina is 😂

"The deeper it is, the better it is for him" 😏
Dame time 😊🎉
Boring ASF
😅😅😅😅😅
Damian is so clutch
This is the last thing to keep ASG weekend alive the suspense is always a delight man how did dame miss on his last rack like that then finish him with the not game but Dame winner 💯💪🏿💯💪🏿
Garry payton est fière de lui
If Larry Bird was in it , then it would have counted FOH.   The hate it real .
Dame timeeee
Trae young trynnna finesse the money ball was high iq
adds every minute... this youtube attempt to force you into paying is really disgusting
Only ture winner is obviously Steph... Clapped all scores... Beyond stupid
Now we need a sudden death challenge with Steph v Dame
Dametime!!!!!
So far the best slam dunk contest of 2016... no debate 💯🔥🔥
the 3pt shooting, is by far the most entertaining thing at the all-star weekend
Bogi would have done it better than TY
Buckets baby 😂😂😂
DAME TIME!
Y'all know how it be man😂😂😂
That cam on Trae's face in the end was 🥶
3 point contest champion and all  star MVP... hoping he will get a ring this year.
the amount of ads on this video🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
It was a great 3pts contest
lets all laugh at trey
sabrina better lol
I think the 3 point contest should work where the contestants themselves can place there 3pt balls in the range they wanna shoot as long as the gaps between each 3pt ball racks is the same so if they wanna go back so be it
Would be nice to see the best players be competitive in this game like it used to be. I'd rather see an 81 to 82 final score than 200 to 180...
I can hear all the Knicks fans that watched this chanting F##k Trae Young 😂
Didn't this guy miss a bunch of games before the ASG?
Shaq should be in there
lol “dame time” but misses 4/5 of the last rack
is the nba going to do anything about kats long middys congrats dame.
I knew it … DL 👏🏼

Comments after the best
the 3 point contest has become way more exciting to watch than that weak ass dunk contest
nice
If KAT's foot is smaller, he wins.
Whoever came up with this idea of the whole floor being a LED screen needs to be fired ASAP
curry shat on everyone
curry shat on everyone else
Ionescu the WNBA Shotter had the same score that lillard and I think is a better shotter that ionescu is awesome ❤
Ben Simmons should be presenting these awards.
Terrible editing
Dame nerves kicked in
Where’s Sam hauser
Why women cant participate to this? WNBA players? Honest question as it probably would be good, no?
i like steph and i do agree he's the best shooter of all time. But damn the fans of him are really immature. he has his moments in all star in a entertaining 3pt shootout with a wnba star. Don't overshadow the efforts of the contestant here especially the winner. Steph fans only see one man wth
Lame-o contest because the officiating was straight trash https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiavI_IR4gM
Dame also won the Tattoo Contest
BORING
Dame doing Dame time gesture after bricking 4/5 is funny to me.
these adds are some bs, no one watches them
Dame just had to prove he come in CLUTCH
7:52 didnt have to do brunson like that
I put a bet on Trey to win😞
Contest is for fun everyone knows dame is the second best male shooter
Trae shoulda won ts😭😭
Why is are they showing that Damian Lillard won right off the bat? Why? That spoils everything
Brunson so close to making it through. Bricked the final two.
Gilak
Starry is nasty
Trae's face when Dame was on the last corner😂😂
The comment section glazing curry is wild straight glazing
3 point contest definitely a premier event lol should be last
This is the  greatest 3 point shootout for me. Until the final round it is still not safe to anyone. and hitting those critical baskets makes this year.  one of the best or maybe the best all star 3pts shootout.
Except for the first shooter, they all coming off the bench
steph be like: Let the kids enjoy😂
They should do a 3 pt contest with just centers jokic, embid, lopez etc
Bro why the spoiler in the thumbnail smh
I swear just turn the volume down during all stars so annoying
cringe af.
I propose to have a 3 point contest next time but 28 ft away, 3 balls each and 2 balls from the half court for it to be more interesting.
And they get paid what!
Dame winner cause Steph didn't want one more....
12 ads in a 17 min video…? Well played NBA 👏
hard to hear anything over the obnoxiously loud arena noise
Boring
Oh Geez  my eyes !! , 😵‍💫😵‍💫, stop it with the colors all over the court NBA, just stop it
Trey knew not to get excited on that last rack—Dame was just building the suspense lol
The bad players should have to play an extra game. The all-stars should get a vacation weekend and stay home. This game is annoying. The hype is so embarrassing. The dunk contest has putrefied. Make the bad players play for a contract.
Wow 20 ads in one video, how money hungry can you get
they didnt give norm hs flowers unfortunately
Needed 26 to get in the finals that’s crazy
Say trey had that same as sabrina?
Sabrina 🚮
trash!!!
SHIT SHOW!! COME BACK WHEN YOU HAVE THE BEST 3 POINT SHOOTER IN THE nba !!!
Steph Curry is the founder and king of 3 pointers and if you think about that he is the one who started making this when all the time since the 3 point line gas always been there...❤😂BOYEEEE
how  is KAT a three point shooter
Actually this is like the actual NBA final game which players shoot brainless 3s 80% of the time.  NBA games now is boring, shooting 3s 80% of the time is boring. Dumb game dumb 3s dumb players
Steph is just better in every way
Why spoil it with the thumbnail????
Wtf you need to spoil who won, NBA channel? Come on man.
Buenos contrincantes
So no one surpass curry in the 3 points contest
Epic contest, congrats Dame 👏👏👏👏
Curry Vs Klay would Be Forever the Greatest One !
Steph and lillard one of the biggest if not biggest names in NBA right now still doing these contests looking to compete not like lebron etc love to see it
The less time on the later rounds is dumb
I find it annoying that the NBA youtube channel always spoils the winner of the event in the thumbnail. It makes the video a lot less enjoyable to watch imo
Tyrese has a Funky looking form
17:17 Who is that in the white on the left?
Malik Beasley more interested in posing than shooting. He lost so much time because he wants to pose.
Let's face it, unless Steph is part of the competition, this is barely more than an exercise... without him I can't take this serious.
DAME ⭕️ i lived in Portland all my life I’ll always see DAME as a BLAZER and the most clutch shooter in the league, of course CURRY too💯
If I were competing I would make sure Steph was there as well. I could never call myself the contest winner without beating him.
That marketing guy from Starry looks like he can ball
what happened to Trae Young at 11:08? was he disqualified or something?
next year let’s do steph vs dame again.. damn 3 point shoot out is much more exctiting nowadays than the slam dunk contest 😂 judges even want to give the W to brown the hell
Dame Time Deep East Oakland legend🏆
Curry vs Sabrina. Curry would win the "real" contest, 29.  But something cool... Sabrina is equality with liliard ,26 😊
Steph still best shooter,he got 29
still nobody shoots it like Craig Hodges, 19 in a row!!!!! Watch that video if you want to see a pure shooter, was was ahead of his time, he would have flourished in the new NBA.
best shooter ever👏👏
Worst all star game I’ve seen
Guy Fieri is a ball bag
Dame vs Steph 3pt shootout would be dope
Dame Time
Where is curry?
Dame misses on purpose to get everyone saying Dame time
He’s so happy to get 2nd to Steph.
The court is criminal
What curry curry. You'll fools, this went to extra miles. Competitive.
Check out rich porter traumatized🌎🌎🌎‼️‼️‼️‼️
We all know 3pt contest is not fun untill steph is part of it
Karl gets 8-9 3pt during one game and he gets into the contest 🤦🏽‍♂️ bruh I wanna see real shooters like boggy and them
Khris Middleton next 3pt contest
♥️🤟🤟🤟♥️
Bricks
Basketball 💩💩
Stupid sports
Njirr kenapa olahraga ini bisa trending 😂
Stop putting the winner's picture on the thumbnail. What's the point of watching it if we already know who won??!! moron !!!
Dame is basically the clutchest dude in the nba. Clutch to end the 1st rd, clutch on tiebreaker, and clutch on the last round to win the title. Mad respect!
We need to see Steph vs dame in a  3 point contest
Congrats on second position after Steph Curry
I feel like 2020s got sucked into Space Jam
3 point contest: ALL All-Stars Slam Dunk Contest: can we get a G-league player to show everyone how it’s done?  What happened to the slam dunk contest? Are players just afraid to miss a dunk or they just do not have any type of imagination. Sad
Ben daha fazla atardım 😂😂
J me k NM m..m mm morning
Didn’t even know this shit was on lol
This 3 point contest only proves that curry is the best shooter period.
Dame Dolla$$$
What's the point of this 2x 3pt shooter and ball hogging the allstar game mvp. I don't blame the ball fans boo dame
NBA Allstar game is the dumbest game ever! only sport they teach kids to go their hardest in Allstar games only to do the exact opposite in a NBA Allstar game! at this point why even play? G league guy wins the dunk contest every year lmao
All star weekend was trash.  4 contestants for the dunk contest?  Cmon
Everybody talking bout steph curry being the best 3 point shooter. He USED to be the best. He might knock em down in events like this and practice. But i been waiting for him to hit 3s in games on my betting slips for weeks now and i stay waiting. I stopped betting on him to drop 3s so id stop losing money
Steph would have smoked  all of them.
Why don’t he shoot like this in games? maybe he just wants out of Milwaukee 😂😂
The goat https://youtu.be/EeHR521XzrI?si=Z58DB1he8gVT1ySp
Nobody gives a fuck about WHEN u shoot the money ball. That Trey Young run was looking legendary. Stupid rule
Yes dame
Lowkey miss the actual 1 min time limit
These guys are extremely lucky Steph got a different challenge.. Chef Curry would have been 3pt champ 2024
Steph and Sabrina are on an entirely different level dan these guys. Imho Sabrina should get drafted by an NBA team. She'd have a tough time defending but should be threatening enough on the offensive end.
Why they get rid of Trey young what did he do
Trae hard selling
1. Curry technically won the 3 pt contest 2. Those who voted other starting guards over Curry is ridiculously dumb-o.
KAT is him!
Towns is crazy. Htf can a 6’10-6’11 dude with insane agility and skill exist. Doesn’t make sense.
Trae have a lot of chance of winning but i guess its not his night yet. Congrats dam time
SO STUPID WHY WOULD YOU PUT WHO WON ON THE THUMBNAIL SO SO IGNORANT
Dame used Dame Time to win the 3PT contest 🤣🤣
One day, imma go watch NBA. Not possible where I'm fron tho😒
The court is cool, but I do wonder if it can be hacked.🤔
Hmb
kat bro you sold that money ball rack
17 minute video became 27 minutes thanks to the unstoppable ads
Is it just more or was the crowd for this contest just the worst? Like I thought the Indy crowd was pulling the “boo mostly every player outside of Hali” antic, but even when it was his turn the it felt the crowd didn’t vibe well or a whole ton.
Why do they have to spoil the winner in the thumbnail? I’d wager to guess most people watching the FULL contest didn’t get to watch it last night, so it’d be a lot more enjoyable if I didn’t immediately know who won.
Starry 😂 that drink sucks 🤮
https://youtu.be/1sZJDUZE9jc?si=sEB3soOSY6EZT_vd
❤
13:08 Dame didn’t even get the shot off
The best 3pt contest
this was literally the only watchable event, this all star weekend has become absolute garbage. dunk contest a laughable joke, the all star game is a joke, the whole weekend is cringe wtf. revamp this garbage. only toddlers will enjoy this shit show. anyone over 10 who actually enjoyed this all star weekend has to be retarded.
Why he troll like that tho
Starry is bad for the body no1 should drink it look at ingredients
what up NBA BROTHERS people saying BLACK kids were not allowed to be ball boys in Indiana. Black people need to boycott that city
"the deeper the better for him"😏
It's Steph then everyone elee
Dame a bitch and will not shoot my fade Ong
Karl Anthony towns is ass and should be disqualified from all future 3pt contest 😡🤬
I wish my boy herro did the 3point contest
Glad they put the winner on the thumbnail just in case. Saved me from enjoying it
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
17:26 😥 RiP City this  hurts hearing every time
Kenny is so fckn annoying goddamn
Nxtym Trae young😅
That was awful
KAT almost had it !!
Dame vs steph next year
Trae almost had them
Who is the journalist in damien back? 17:28
Nice job Damian. One thing that sucks is that Steph is still better than u from three 🙃. Not hating I’m just saying fax
if I didnt know better dame missed those 3 on purpose so he can end it with the last one...
No nuggets???
Curry and Sabrina
Dunk n three pt contest arent at all what they used ti be in 80s..... Lame
John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that He gave His One and Only Son so that whoever believes in Him, shall not perish but have eternal life” God loves you no matter what, never forget that!😊😊%,
Why didn't Steph play?
It would be interesting if Steph and Sabrina did 3 rounds too. 1st round is what they did now.2nd round WNBA 3pt line and ball.3rd round NBA 3pt line and ball.
13:08 and you can see Dame is out. He shouldn't won.
Nakaw l.a nxt🎉
NBA, these are the people we want to see in the all star games. We want to see our favorite players and the top players, not random bench players that no one has ever heard of.
I could've watched, if i didn't know who won... Sucks
You fucking  r e t a r d s, don’t make the thumbnail a picture of the winner holding the trophy! Now I know who wins and the fun is massively diminished. Fucking stupid!
that last shot felt like Curry's 2021 3pt contest win
damian lillard haciendole creer a young que tenia oportunidad de ganar dx
Curry actually won he had 29
Next year I want to see the women compete in the dunk contest.
Lame time
Was that guy fiere or...wait what am i saying, who else looks like that lol
Dame barely won lol that clock almost dead lol
Why wasn’t that one dude who went 13-14 in this
Sabrina got 26 literally better shooter than Mitchell
Cant wait for Coach Nick from BBALLBREAKDOWN to analyze my favourite player's shooting form (Dame)
Thumbnail literally spoiled the video
They really cheated in the first tie breaker both young and dame should have had 15 because go back and watch dame didn’t get that last shot off before the shot clock hit
All this, while Steph casually scored 29 pts against Sabrina 😂😂😂
I can beat Dame and all these guys in a 3 point contest no Cap
The GREEN BEAN COURT
Congrats dame
Abrets gugs
lillard missed those on purpose, you could tell
Putting the winner in the thumbnail takes away from 1st time viewers.
jajasj fallo intencionalmente
Damn, I was sweating after watching this.
That was fun
Tray young was clutch lowkey! 8 threes in a row
Wow,they all suck compared to the GOAT Curry
Coby White should be here.
trae sitting there like "aint no mf way.."
This was way more entertaining than the dunk contest. Congrats to Lillard!
why would you spoil who the winner is in the thumbnail????? 🤦‍♂
Steph so good he don’t even participate
Todas as bolas deveriam valer os mesmos pontos, sem diferença. Aí se mediria quem é melhor. Bolas com mais pontos não representam dificuldade maior.
Love seeing Milwaukee across Dames chest!!! Goosebumps man! I’m MKE born and raised!
Dame take your time in the last rack lmaooo 😅
Sorry not good at all without Steph
Should be called the Stephen Curry Trophy
Just let Dame have a good moment. Everyone bringing up Steph is just making us fans look bad.
We all know Dame missed the last few on purpose just so he could have a buzzer beater to win on the last shot, that’s his specialty
I was hoping someone would of gotten 28-30 or else dame would of lost
Steph lowkey won this too when he beat Sabrina.
why do yall spoil the winner smh
They shouldve just extended it and added Steph/Sabrina  She wouldve made tiebreaker for final
Lillard looks so scared...
Good lord do u guys wipe ur chins off after slobbering down Currys load, man didnt even compete in the contest yet here you guys are lol
💵💵💵💵💵🏀🏀🏀 🔥 🔥💪
Lighting , all this neon green and shtt,  disturbing and bad bad choice.
People will always take away from Dame just to say Steph is better. This may be the case but can’t we just enjoy greatness? Yall meat ride so hard.
3pts: Steph>Klay>Sabrina>Dame>Trae>Beasley Dunks: Shaq>Dawkins>Jordan>Carter>McClung Skills: Kobe>Wade>Irving>Kidd>Rose>Nash>SGA Impact: Lebron>Durant>McGee>Jr.Smith>Jordan Poole>Ben Simmons
Trae should of won
Every nigga that loves Sprite feels betrayed. As a Canadian wtf is Starry?
Shooting in a game is different steph will always be the best
Trae young is trash
I love diving competitions😊
Who's Steph. Stojakovic still the best ever.
You guys had to spoil it with picture of the winner 😮‍💨😮‍💨
Proud of haliburton man finally something to be proud of in Indianapolis
Damn time 🕕🕕🕕🕕🕛
Why Steph did not play with them? I know he did with Sabrina but why not in the regular?
Steph hold my hat 🧢 to Dame . With respect
Slow the video down dame didn’t get that last shot off kat should’ve won
It is funny how the NBA builds up todays players talking about 3pt records. Craig Hodges hit 21 of 24 3pt shot in a round and nobody to this day has done that since and they say nothing!!!!
Happy for Dame and glad they took Steph out the mix to give these boys a chance lol Dame ⌚️
Why everybody mad because dame won i dont get it.
"I believe I can fly", just don't cut it anymore thanks to Steph. Exciting contest, more so than the Dunkin one.
They cheated dame time didn’t get that last ball off in time 🤦🏽‍♂️
Anyone peep guy fieri smoking a cigar at the end LMAO
Tyrese form weird af but that shii goes in! 😂
17:19 #DameFame aka #DamienLilliard 🎉✨️🎁🏀
bro brunson would have stayed because towns actually got 24 if you put the video to 0.25 speed and look at the shotclock above the basket not on the screen it was red and at 0.0 when it was on his fingertips
next year add a defender and make the shots contested.  that'll tell who can shoot.
What about Klay? 🤔
Reggie needs to go back to UCLA with a complaint! “ guys I know I was on scholarship but who the hell was teaching me arithmetic? “ - after Reggie was repeatedly blurting out “ he NEEDS to him them all to have a chance!!” Yikes
LoL, imagine shooting with this distracting light on the court... What a circus.
Dame time⌚
Sabrina will cook most of these NBA superstars
Kenny talking mad sh*t😂😂he been hanging around shaq a lot
Curry won it by stat
Tbh Brunson almost had them lol🤣🤦🏻‍♂️
Dame time strikes again
It was that time
Karl Anthony towns impersonation of  lebron 😂😂😂😂😂
Kenny said [when Dame was shooting], "The DEEPER it is, the BETTER it is for him." Aye man lol
Dame been the best 3pt shooter in the league for awhile now
what happened to the sponsor Sprite?
DAME TIME #414 🕺🏽
Beastleys Shooting form is the most i really dont like im sorry man, that left hand is really sending shivers to me.
Why not put all 4 in the finals instead of the tiebreaker?
No one can beat Sabrina's 37 pts.
Karl Anothony THIS NOT YOUR RANGE BUT WE LOVE YOU DOE wish u woulda won this for the Big Man position
bro i don’t understand why neither of the bogdonovics dobt pkay bro (i know i butchered the name)
KAT out there shooting 2’s😂
Got Dame on my fantasy team, wish this mf would hit like this in games. 😤
How many fucking times he gone tell us "he has his money rack left.."   we fucking know lol
It's crazy that steph got 29 and the highest in the actual 3pt contest was 26. Step the goat fosho!
Steph would probably be top two every year
Steph still the king who scores 29 vs sabrina
Everyone here talking steph this steph that. He had 3 more points made. Mfs acting like he went out there and blew everyone out the water🤦‍♂️
Hero and duncan is lowkey men, respect them. They didnt enter the 3pt contest
Sabrina's 37 pts in WNBA 3 PT contest is insane.
Donovan will never when the 3pt contest he a more efficient 3pt shooter off the dribble then a spot up shooter and that basically what the contest is
DAME FOR SURE MISSED the first 4 on last rack to make it a little bit more fun I GUARANTEE
do you really think to spoiler the winner in the thumbnail is a good idea? wtf?
Why is there a refereee out there for this? Lol
Nice job NBA, showing the winner on the thumbnail of the video.  Thats a bozo move.
The most boring job  referee
For some reason, I knew dame was going to win this one after seeing the thumbnail 😅
No DLo from Lakers?
Does Craig Hodges still play?
DAME $$$ TIME !!!
Why Steph wasn’t in the 3 point competition
Some people better in game shooters than in 3 pt contest
TRAE YOUNG IS HIMM
Curry is better than that mcclung bum
Dame ⌚
Yes sir Chef Stephen Curry MVP! Three pointers made all-time, Legend's ✍
The greatest to ever shoot a basketball 🙌 -30xMVP- Curry🐐
Im surprised no one got a tech right there
Dame can miss his shots all game, but don’t let him take the last shot.
Dame was trolling on the last rack just for Dame time.
KAT, the first* big-man to win the three-point contest (*according to Allie LaForce, who apparently has never heard of Dirk). Also, the first to shoot more two-point-shots than threes in the three-point-contest. Not a great look for the league and the contest, do better. Fortunately, Steph came to save the day in his own event.
If u look better the last shot of damian lilliard on round 2 does not counted because the clock timer  already gone before he made his last shot... KAT must be the winner🙂
Why the second round its more short? I dont get it..
Curry's son 🤙🏻
Where is buddy hield!
This green ass court is disgusting to watch
there's a difference between someone passing you the ball vs picking it up from the tray
That court is sick!!!
3point contest better than slam dunk contest because of the stars!
Brook Lopez should be in the 3 point contest and Austin Reeves. Where’s Luka? Dame Steph Trae Klay. Even that one dude from Denver….
Is that even valid without Steph Curry? I don’t think so..
They should change the order of the events to skills challenge, slam dunk and last 3 point contest
not a shooter contest
Kar almost wing de competition
Why he dont shoot like this on the bucks
Kenny Smith has been so annoying this whole entire night it's cringy. Gotta swap him out
I wish Sabrina was in the 3 point shoot out.
Bro Steph would eat this up
Hacia años que no veía los concursos all star ..... Son una puta mierda , inflando puntuaciones 😡 da mucho asco , vuelvan a hacer concursos de verdad , esto es un show y malo
who is the better shooter ， stp or dame？
Malik wasn't shooting like that with the Lakers
In the final round they miss counted one of KATs shots
Not the revenge contest for dame 😂😂. Sitting at 34% for the season
Hey NBA  f**y ** how about the 3pnt.shooter dlo,reaves.
Sabrina could have defeated them if she were also there
Why didn't Steph was at 3p contest?
Why dame in final round he’s last shot for 16pts was not counted right? He ran out of time
Cancha así 👎🏼
Jumpshot forms are getting weirder and weirdsr
Damn,  many people writing:"Curry score 29, and 3 point contest champion score 26",but you don't take there was more pressure on Dame, I agree Steph-best  shooter all-time , but don't underrate Dame.
They r lucky that Stephen Curry didn't join the 3 point contest
Crazy to think Tyler herro or Keegan Murray aren’t on here
Dame>Steph
I was hoping brunson bring one to the city 😔
9:50 biggest pause of all time, "The deeper it is the better is"??? dawg 😂
Um? Anyone think the lights, color, and terrible sound effect a shooter? The lights is the biggest problem for me but the announcers are very obnoxious.
YO THAT LAST BALL BY DAME IN THE 2ND ROUND SHOULD  NOT HAVE COUNTED.   BALL STILL IN HIS HANDS WHEN THE CLOCK EXPIRED
Let’s go back to the old school, 1 MONEY BALL per rack. These high numbers aren’t real
Dame rlly put himself in a clutch situation at the end he definitely missed all 4 on purpose
Majority of people in the common section are “hating” of Dame Dollar for a player that didn’t enter the 3pt contest because he’ve got a gender 3pt contest elsewhere. Some of the people are “hating” on Dame Dollar and if a white player won the 3pt contest then that when the “hating” stop.
I didn’t watch the 3 point contest this night, but i figured out the winner by the cover of this video. Pls next year, don’t put the winner on the video’s cover and let us enjoy the moment of discovering the winner while watching it
Honestly Trae may have won if he has a solid first rack.
We need steph man!!
I need steph in 3pt contest -_-
Curry?????
i’d like to see N. Powell
sabrina can absolutely cook some of these stars 😂
Nice touch putting the winner on the thumbnail. Spoils everything
Thats very close scoring points. Dame was just got luck this time🏆⏰👏
Beasly over dlo? Nahhh
Kapono and Stojakovic could easily outscore these punks basing on how many bonus points ball this game has.
Wth are these ads
Steph joining would have put more pressure on him and less on Dame so Dame would have delivered 30 points
For anyone that doesn’t know this is not the pacers court, this is Lucas Oil Stadium where the Colts play
fighez
jason kapono making 26 without any of that
Curry had 29 points!
There's no real stakes in this three-point contest, knowing Steph Curry won even without being in the contest.
The 3 shots is trolling AHHHAHA
Chicken Gizzard Damian Lillard
I know Brunson can shoot but he had business being in the 3 point contest
So many ads but good job to everyone
y steph is not there in this contest?
PUT SOME RESPECT ON HIS NAME ITS DAME TIME!!!
Why wasn't Grayson Allen invited to the 3 point contest?
why step is not here
I wonder why durant never participate in this event, his a good 3pointer he could win this contest.
Noooo Brunson i thought was going to make 30 points 😢
Umay sa commercial
Now you all agree that there are categories in sports that women rule over men?
Karl Anthony Towns ❤❤ #32  What an awesome job!
Sorry for the question but can anybody explain me why Steph is not competing anymore?
Dame is officially back. People panicking on the Bucks
Not the same without Curry. But still the 3 point contest is legitimate. People are trying their best to win and it is the only part of the "All-Star" event which looks genuine.
Can even the watch the thing in 2 minutes wassup with these ads nbs
I enjoy a good spoiler in the thumbnail.
Tyrese shoots like an amputee
Нахуя на превью ставить победителя
Curry lost this contest in 2010, 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2019. Steph Curry that is for anyone confused.
Trae Young must be really exhausted from shooting threes in the Drills Challenge then the 3-point Contest damnn. And still made the top 3
Why Malik Beasley hands mechanics make me smile? 😅
This three point contest was the best
Sooo Curry won the 3pt contest :DDDD
AMD as usual My Steph curry Do me a favor. Can u be my Hero
why isnt steph here
Not including here is just BS
O kadar para kazanıyoz videoyu reklamla donatmıssınız ananaısızı sıkeyım bi all star izliyemiyoruz oropsu evlatları
Best pork chop recipe https://youtu.be/nHJFTQmPd_w?si=tCk3XP3MY8Yx-IaB
Yo if u see right here 6:53 they added him 2 points and his score went from 1 to 3 while he only made one shot in the corner and they kept those 2 points to his final score they didnt remove them
Why steph didnt participate
#DamianLillard #DameTime #Chronos 👏🏾🏀⌚️💫🏆♥️
5542
⌚️⌚️⌚️
Dame’s a fool! Lmao. You know he missed them jawns on purpose! Just for “Dame Time” That’s how you put on a show tho’ 💪🏼
Damian is at Sabrina level
Where was Curry?
I think that Bogdan Bogdanovic is the best in this
Why would you put the winner in the thumbnail? Dislike!!!
Alguém sabe me informar pq curry n está nessa disputa Pq qual motivo
Whoever wins the challenge ,gets a title shot and we keep that going . Steph vs Dame next.
Damian Lillard the defending champion. Since last year winner of 3 point shootout
Traeeeeeeeeeee😭😭😭
Naw b4 dame see steph in tgis contest he gotta prove he can beat klay..  all 3 of them needs to go against each other honestly
I just want to see Klay and Steph compete against each other on 3 point contest 😊
9:50 pause.
GLAD DAME WON
Curry’s great off the catch. Let them do a contest where someone is passing to him and watch him fly
Wow! The court looks like it's from mountain dew!
Im rooting for trae even before it started, But damn, That was close
Bogdan Bogdanovic should be here
Michael Smith must be a good 6'4/5 he's way taller then Dame
9:49 🤳 WHAT DID HE SAAAAYYYYY?!
Love watching them root for each other. Wish this admiration was present in all games, rather than win at all costs. More Olympian.
Why did Steph not compete ?
Nobody :  Reggie Miller: That Long ball is too close for him (says it twice)  DAMIEN: PRoceeds to miss the long ball
> <  3
Crunch Time! Im just like DAME LILLARD
When will the 3pt trophy be named Stephen Curry trophy? It's about time.
Dame time is now we don't care about next
the only trophy he will win lol
Please do Steph vs Dame next yearrr 🔥
Thanks for the spoil …
If I'm being honest, this should be the main event of the skills competition. The dunk contest just doesn't appeal anymore, imo.
Commentator talking about Dame's shot:" The deeper it is the more he likes it"  Pause...
again, the 3pt contest was the main event
I don't even know why Beasley is in this
your did it!
wow, this floor suck, gives you brain damage to look at. So distracting ! 😳 Must be even worse for the players, they got the light shining right up in their eyes !
Why the fuck you’ve had to put Dame on the  thumbnail  Good spoiler nba thanks🤦🏻‍♂️
how many fucking does this video have? jesus
rooting for Halliburton cause of that jumpshot looks strange but satisfying to watch
hmm wonder who won the contest bc I missed it goes on yt sees dame in thumbnail hmm I wonder
Koyacaginiz thumbnaili s2yim
sabrina would have beaten them🤣🤣🤣
Steph dropped 29 and he wasn’t even taking it that serious.
why is 3pt contest more entertaining than the dunk contest
Curry dickriders going crazy in the comments, at a point yall gotta ask yourself if yall even like basketball
this best all years
Why is so dark there.
When people say Curry could win.He won 2 out of 7 matches in 3pt contest.Don't exaggerate.He's GOAT at shooting but not god. This contest was great where guys competed in 3 freaking rounds to get a win.And how can you know if Steph would survive that bloodbath. Even Lillard won only because of the last ball.And if he missed in next round he could lose to Trae or KAT.Just admit it was great contest without jerking off at Curry pls
🏆 BUTTON > STEPH vs DAME
Dame did that on purpose so he could do Dame time 😂😂😂😂
The trophy is garbage though. Shame they've changed it, there was zero reasons to do it.
3-point contest result  1st- Stephen Curry-29 2nd- Lillard/Sabrina-26
They were lucky curry didn't join
In the second round, Notre Dame missed the final shot, so it should have been just 15 points, unable to advance to the finals. So he really should be the 3 point contest champion?😡
Steph with 29points without the 3 point ball
Donavan Mitchell is jealous of Jalen brunson he wish he was a knick
Best shooter in the world played against a girl, but that girl scored the same than the contest winner, they should have put them here instead of having their own event
why show the winner on the thumbnails you idiots
KAT's last shot of the 1st round actually didn't get off in time. he should only got 24. Meaning Haliburton got robbed because there should be no tie-break round
Pasalamat ka  Damian at wala si king  steph curry  sana dika mananalo..
Damn, he got a bit nervous at the end, he could have done easily a 29 total damn time!
Steph a B
You know guys when steph not there it's not 3 point contest😂
WHY SPOIL IT WITH THAT THUMBNAIL !? SHEESH CMON NBA U GUYS STINK!
DAME TIME
Bogi is the best 🎉❤
Goodjob spoiling it in the Thumbnail👍🏻
they're thankful Steph wasn't in the main event... 😂
Kenny Smith needs to be quite!!
Reggie “His money rack is coming up” Miller
SUPER COMPETITIVE!!!! Dame Dolla a sniper!!!!
Why the spoiler thumbnail?
W
Which again proves Steph to be the greatest shooter in NBA history
Bravo Lillard
Clay💯🔥
That court is amazing , especially with the effects
dame did that on purpose coz theres no way🤣⌚️
we miss you dame all of us in Portland
Why is Steph not participating besides his showdown with Sabrina lol
@Nba thanks for putting Dame on your thumbnail to ruin the experience 👎
With every year that goes by Kenny becomes a bigger legend in his own head. At this point he’s an 11 time all star, 6 time all NBA and used to out rebound Barkley and dunk over Shaq.
To Shaq, Chuck, Kenny and Ernie, how does it feel to be wrong about who each of you thought would win the 3-point contest, only to have Dame win it back to back! All of your anal cavities must really hurt from all that kcid gnidir you were willing to do for those other NBA 3-Point Contest Lames! 😂 And what the hell was going on with the refs! KAT's foot touched the line how many times and no points deducted! This is a preview of how the NBA's second half is going to go with the No Calls and Unwarranted Calls. Bucks Players beware!
"He's a winner though Reg, NO he isn't!!" 7:53 Kenny was trolling
Thank you for revealing the result as the thumbnail. Made it much more fun to watch.
MFs all shooting for second. We all know Dame won because Stephen Curry wasn’t  in this contest. He scored 26 and Steph shot 29 against Sabrina
Drink a shot everytime Reggie says "his money rack is coming up"
✨️💥
Saw more ads than 3pointers made
Kat was on the line the whole first rack of the 2nd round lmao  Tyrese robbed 😔
Towns underrated
People saying steph should have participated cause he would win easily. Nah he so good he got his own competition with his name on the price.
Steph may be the best shooter ever but I would still give the ball to Dame the end of the game for the last second shot!
I def enjoyed that it’s been a while since I got to sit back and watch a 3 point contest 😎💪🏾
trae could've won this one
🏀🏀🏀🏀🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾🏆🏆🏆🏆💯💯💯💯
KEEP CRYING ABOUT STEPH Y'ALL SOUND LIKE A BUNCH OF BITCHES
Dame out here doing side quests
Wow at least Milwaukee got a title this year
3Point goat 🎉🎉
The commercials in this video is surprisingly abundant
Nobody will Beat the KING OF THREE POINTS SHOT!! Steph CurrY💪😤😤😤😤
Steph n Sabrina are  way better shooter's n they weren't in the comp lol
at the same time Curry got 29 😂
Sabrina would've won this one
Steph had 29 ladies and gentlemen.
Bleh, Steph Curry would've won this.
That thumbnail spoiled everything😂
Dame Time!
Damn Steph should have won with 29
its insane that outside of the money ball markannen hit everything but one in the other four places, its one of the cleanest and yet he still lose lmao
24 to win the 3 points  contest  😂😂😂😂😂
Curry won the people's champ.
13:09 Lillard did not make the last shot😂
Sabrina could’ve beat them all
KAT should have won it unlucky
Why you put the winner on the thumbnail????????
Even my hair, JB, is better than yours. The jury must have taken a bribe to make JB the primary, but MC went crazy again.
Crazy how steph had 29 and the next closest was 26 in the entire contest😂
lilard time
All star contests whether it be nba or nfl are complete jokes. Nba giving jb 48’s and 49’s for bootleg dunks, and keeping the best 3pt shooters out of the 3pt contest. And nfl playing flag football and dodgeball 😂 Lame asf
Steph knows if he did the 3pt contest every year he’d probably win. Dame might steal 2/10 but that’s it. That’s why he doesn’t do the competition anymore. He lets others have a chance to have the title.
shout out to sabrina they should have put her in the regular contest
These are just participation trophies. The real award is who ever beats Steph.
this more entertaining than dunk contest what. I guess Zac Lavine and Gordon ruined it
⌚🏆
They had to keep Steph aside for not having it all.
?   *
it would have been more interesting if different position would do this.. imagine Jovic vs AD vs Joel doing this
The game high was 26 Steph casually dropped 29 he could have easy won the contest lol
I don't give a f. Klay is a better shooter than Dame. KD is a better shooter than Dame. Joker is a better shooter than Dame.
Next year should just be steph vs dame from 30ft plus
Next year it needs to have Steph and a couple of the WMBA stars in there.
Am I the only one that can't stand the CONSTANT COMMENTARY??
Lakers de bulunan Walker bunlardan iyi 3 Luk atıyor
⌚️
Here me out 3 point contest with a long range line
No one beats Dame the range balls . Its his favourite ball
Curry had 29. Amd lets just be real here,steph is the most pure best shooter in the league still
Karl town was stepping into the line mostly .
13:07 did Dame get that last ball off in time? Did they review it in slow motion on the live broadcast?
oh my god trae young you had this
The 3 point contest saved all star weekend. So glad I could just watch this on youtube.
Congradulations to Damian Lillard
Thanks for ruining the winner with the damn thumbnail💀
This is all scripted. Fucking bullshit
DAME really be another Curry fr.
These mf can’t shoot 💀💀 who tf picked them to be in this contest???
The court is distracting
9:50 wait what do you mean by that?
Dame’s last shot at 13:11 is not counted tho.
thank you for the spoiler on the THUMBNAIL 😂😂😂😂😮😮😮😮
It was crazy🤯 It was Dame time😎
I wish curry was there 😢
Imagine... after all this...they announce "now for the final round.. you've to compete with curry"😂... dude's wd have run for their life
Why does curry look like lillard on the thumb nail???
Why is steph not in 3 point contest? Why should he vs sabrina
No offense to these amazing shooters... but Steph VS Sabrina turned out to be the REAL 3PT contest.  What an amazing night of shooting.
Haliburton still shooting with both hands lmao  Great facilitator but geez it don’t bother you that you look like a middle schooler trynna shoot the ball
@NBA Why you put the winner on the title page and ruin the suspense of the video like I already know who is going win. Thank you 😒🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
dame time missing 4 in a row is crazy
sabrina shoulda been the winner, her feet were behind the line. If she participated she woulda won. Embarrassing for NBA players tbh
Clay Thomson and Curry should do better then all of you !!!
Why does Lillard compete? He is not even happy for win it.
Yeah steph and klay should be there to say it's official 😮
No Steph Curry, all of you are boring , how could you not have Steph Curry in the game ? Sorry A….
That's the most embrassing 3PT contest champion. Steph got 29, and the lady got 26🤣🤣🤣
For me?? Still Rey Allen 👍👍👍❤❤❤
Do they win money as well?
curry eat them all
It‘s insane that Markkanen hit the most shots in a round all evening and was eliminated in the first round!
Imagine the whole court becomes red after he misses a shot😂
Why is malik beadely even there . He foesnt even score in games when he's wide open
16:57 lmaoo look at trae young he look like a my career cut scene after playing your rival and they make them win 😭😭😭
Dame is basically the clutchest dude in the nba. Clutch to end the 1st rd, clutch on tiebreaker, and clutch on the last round to win the title. Mad respect!
I had to watch on mute because Kenny the jet wont shut the fuck up, You’re not in the competition, no one cares how you did it 40 years ago you fucking dinosaur
What’s a 3pt contest without curry nowadays💀
Y is everybody bringing up curry curry obviously didn’t shoot in this so it’s dame time y’all can’t say what would’ve happened
Ads ads ads
Where is Steph?
Kenny was just annoying man
I know Portland fans are salty 😂😂
So I gotta watch 1 min ad to start then spammed with another 10 ads. Insane.
Who was the female reporter on the baseline behind Dame when he got his trophy??
Congrats, Dame! But Curry is still the best 3-point shooter ever lived. No one can take that away from him. Sabrina, she's great.
easy for CURRY... HAHAHA
- What's Lillard's case for Hall of Fame - he's 2-time 3pt contest champ - What about serious accolades - he's a ROY and 2-time 3pt contest champion
Sabrina should join Men's 3PT shooting.
DAME SHOULD BRING BACK HIS OWN AGGRESSIVENESS THE TRUTH IS PRIMARY GO TO SHOULD BE HIM IF THEY WANT TO WIN CHAMPIONSHIP NOT SAYING HE IS BETTER THAN GA BUT GA CAN HAVE THOSE SECOND SHOT BECAUSE OF HIS SIZE AND REACH THAT SHOULD BE THEIR PLAY MJ AND SP RATHER THAN KB AND SHAQ MY BAD BUT SAME LOGIC
I was about to die if dame missed every shot of the last rack... Dame goat
Dame just filed for divorce and I truly hope this award can make him happy. Oh, did u guys see my alumni Brook Lopez in the crowd?
Curry got 29pts that’s why he’s the greatest shooter of all time. They only got 26pts
why wasnt steph part of it?
Guy Fieri stole the show with the ice and the stogie
Good highlights but I wish you hadn't uploaded the winner in the thumbnail, it takes away the suspense.
Steph would have won  lol
He’s so happy to get 2nd to Steph.
KAT was on the line on many of those.
26 xDDD
Steph still the best
Just a suggestion. Try not to spoil the video by not revealing the results in the thumbnail. I always watch other nba channels because it is more exciting to watch till end not knowing the results.
steph: bro gimme dat
For all those saying if curry participated he’d easily win. Remind me again how many times curry participated in the contest and won? Oh thats right he participated in 7 and won 2. So stop dick riding steph as if its easy to win the 3 point contest.
Now Sabrina and the next WNBA 3PT Champ gotta go up against Dame, Steph and the next 3Pt Champ next ALL Star Game.
I love this game...  Congrats to Lillard and the rest of the boys for making my day!
Am I the only one who hates to hear Kenny Smith talks
The court must have been distracting
Shoutout to Donovan wearing a jersey honoring Sam Merrill. Classy man.
Dame activated the Clutch Shooter Badge on the right time. He a 2-time 3pt Champ now. Now the fans need the half-court contest of Steph (whose also 2-time 3pt Champ) and Dame to see who will take the title of the 3pt Shootout King.
Easy win if curry joined 3pt contest
yall crying so much.. dame is the defending champ so he had to defend his title lmao
Larry Bird will teach this young fellas
These guys are the best? Lol
Even sabrina got 26 points. And nobody reached to 29 points. Except curry😮
17:25 dat TROPHY in the back is NICE 😮‍💨😂
That grimace shake Ohio rizz
Skibidi toilet ohio rizz
this new led court is so distracting. who in their right mind in the NBA board approved this shiiit?!?
Malik Beasley 🤣
The Charity 3pt contest lol
Steph and Sabrina smoked all of them.
Bruh HOW MANY COMMERCIALS!
I like how Sabrina literally mogged everyone in this year’s contest☠️☠️☠️ she got 26 in her first try and she’s in the WNBA whereas these scrubs couldn’t even get more than that after several rounds😭😭AND….Steph still got the night’s high score (29) with only one go…so we all know who really won🤫🧏‍♂️CURRY MOGS ALL
Where is Grayson Allan?
Sabrina better than these
Never should’ve read comments. Steph is my dude but y’all glazing like hell!!!
Steph had 29...
Tyrese shooting form….😂😂😂
11:42 💀💀💀
I almost forgot there was this actual nba 3point after I only watched Sabrina vs Steph
Derrick white should have been here!
Mitchell was even worseeeeee😂
Don't want to hear anyone trash Sabrina Ionescu again. She got 26 from the NBA line where she normally doesn't shoot from, and she put pressure on Steph. These guys couldn't scrape past 26 despite shooting from that same line routinely.
Damn Trey….that shit was terrible 😂
Starry ??? , Starry ?? .. Wdh happened ta Sprite ? 😂😂
Why luka never invited?
9:31 💀💀💀
Oakland Dame!!
13:06 is crazy 😭😭😭
Great build up by dame to finish on final shot
where is grayson allen?
Why is Steph not participating?
All star getting worse by the year...
3 min into the video and 6 ads already nice NBA
Dame Lillard is more CLUTCH than anyone in the league including Stephen Curry,  by the way,  don't get duped as Stephen Curry is a solid shooter,  but give me Larry Bird any day!!!!
dame scored 26 and wins the contest   steph and sabrina: ow that's cute 😅
If you haven't watched the Dunk Contest yet, please don't , it will just destroy your AllStar's momentum
if Steph was in there your cooked bro like sorry Dame
I’m glad the clowns running the NBA YT channel decided it was a good idea to put Dame holding the trophy on the thumbnail -_- totally not a spoiler… morons
I really want KAT to win this one! It should’ve another big man winning this contest since Big Dirk.
Why wasn’t Steph in this?
Dame only won because of that stupid long range AD lmao. bring back old school 3pt games.
Europe player vs USA
I know that last rack Dame was like wtf
Steph hit 29... just saying
The green glowing floor threw them off. WTF are they thinking!?
They should just be taking the top 3pt shooters in the league. Players don’t care, but I’d love to see a dominant 3pt champ several years in a row. That’s why NBA sucks. Players only care about money, no pride
Kind of pointless to separate the 3PT contest and the Steph vs Sabrina contest. It's all the same shots, same contest. Steph wins with 29. Would've been interested to see Sabrina and Dame to duke it out for 2nd place.
So gross watching Haliburton shoot basketballs 🤢 🤢 🤮
Bring Steph in he is the real winner he scored 29
Steph is banned😂😂 klay is not around😂😂 thats for sure free!
lmao dame missing the last few shots just to make the last one 🤣🤣 dame timee
So real basketball players got 30points for a perfect score an these guys get a possible 40pts and barely get 22?  I thought basketball was more skilled now?
I'm happy for DAME he would look better in MIAMI HEAT jersey!!! Yeah I'm with the shiiiiiiit 😂😂
Yall could’ve did without the picture who won on the thumbnail for those who didn’t catch it 🙄
Trae Young?  Why would they allow a career 34% shooter to compete here?
Does everyone realize they had to add two 3 point shots and a full money ball rack to this competition for “these better players” to still not even beat scores from 80-90s?  And that’s all ppl do know is shoot threes 😂😂😂 nba is sad now
They robbed markenen
I wonder if the refs feel useless out there
Dame just shut everyone the hell up who’s been talking shi about him lately
볼보이들 진짜 눈치대가리없네 공좀 가까이 밀어주지 그걸 그냥 다 멍청하게 앉아있냐 돌대가리들
Dame nervous af. And thats the only thing he will ever get. No ring 😂
I heard the "NOPE" with Beasley 😂😂😂
Why didn’t Steph play
steph rly woulda beat them too lmao
Steph: they fight for second
Sabrina would of beat all these guys 😂😂😂 good thing curry beat her tho 😂
I wish they made the time-limit longer. As a viewer, I don't want to see a bunch of rushed shots miss. I'd rather see a slower rhythm with more makes.
I thought the guys head at 1:07 was another ball lol
Tyrese has a Funky looking form😂😂
Wouldnt have been competitive if Steph was there...
The fact Duncan Robinson wasn’t in this 3 pt shootout is insane that’s why the selected big names which are bunch of low volume shooters 👎🏿😒
Should've added Steph as the final level. Like a "boss fight" lol
Dame is still right there in convo for 2nd best shooter. He shoots from any distance and anywhere. His 37% career is basically 37% from WAY back from the 3pt line. In fact Dame has the highest career 3pt shooting % from 30 feet or deeper in nba history. He takes and makes more from 30 ft than anyone ever.. including the greatest shooter ever in Curry. DAME and Curry are both top 4 in career FT% btw. A testament to how pure and accurate and repetitive their shot and form is.
If Curry joined this contest, I'm sure he woulda gotten over 30pts.
Nice spoiler as the cover photo.
Curry still win with 29
9:50 “the deeper it is the better it is for him” 😭😭😭😭
After just watching a video of Dame saying he don’t got it no more😂😂
Trae young the best ever !
This was actually entertaining being that it was a close match. No one lead by massive lead. Kept you guessing. Competitive the whole time.
The head of marketing at Starry being a brother is not surprising to me.
It’s crazy that in the old 3 point contest you might get 3 guys that hit over twenty points, now that shit is normal 😂
reggie talks way too much
Almost had a 3 way tie if Dame missed that last shot with 24pts. Then another round and I think Trae would win it.
Would be cool if you didn’t show the gd winner holding the trophy in the thumbnail, you f*cking dingdongs
Let's go any man and towns
Steph kinda took over the spotlight, and he didn't even mean to do it.
thanks for spoiling it in the thumbnail
Steph didn't even compete and still put up the best score of the night
Should steph and sabrina joined them😂😂
Still the wnba😄No one can beat  even the next 30years.
What is the point of doing 3 point contest, when it's not even 3 point lol 😂.  Like if you want to dismiss the rule i would've just shoot is inside the line 😂. It's stupid
What do you guys think of the LED court?
Y’all Know what time is it?
Steph would beat them in a 3 point contest
Why wasnt steph in the contest
This is less impressive when steph did 29 😂
Good job ruining the suspense by showing the winner in the thumbnail. SMH
Lol feel sorry for dame we all know who the 3 point king is ..
29 without starry is crazy Steph would’ve dominated this
Sbarina > 3 contest player
Dame the best pressure 3 point in todays league
The deeper it is the better it is for him 💀
Curry is the best😂
13:07 look at dame's final shot to tie's KATs score- he did not get it off in time- he was actually 0.1 seconds late. as much as he earned it the winner should have been KAT or Trae
NBA sponsor's should be in the description
9:48 AYOOOO Reggieeeeee xD
SABRINA Got 26
Karl Anthony Towns. The best big man shooter of all time. Dirk's league🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴
son of curry
Sabrina better 😂
Miami Heat's starting point guard after this offseason.
3 point contest was more entertaining these past few years than the slamdunk contest. Fight me.
Pause bros on something 9:50
Big congrats to dame time 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼☝🏼
Why would you put the winner in the thumbnail smh there goes my reason to watch the video after missing it live
Steph vs Sabrina: Steph got 29pts.  Others in this 3pt contest the closes points they got is 26 😂.
This shit is garbage wtf is this f Time trey Young  all the way
Dame even clutch on a 3pt contest god dame!
Towns is better
Sabrina scored 26. Damn . It would have been nice to watch her compete with this group. She would have tied her score with these guys. And the 2nd round would have been fun to watch.
Dam time😮
Curry could have won😢
Steph and Sabrina are better than .  Official 3points shoot contender .
man that shooting form of Dame is really good! congrats Dame!
Kung kasali curry dyan si curry pa rin ang panalo malamang
This year’s 3pt contest doesn’t mean anything when Steph just dropped 29 against Sabrina in 1 round lol
Steph dame and Sabrina todays 3pt legends
Highest score was 26… steph woulda clowned them all… klay could have atleast shot… jeez.
Sabrina >>>>>> 😂
Sad and ugly 3 point contest and even worse dunk contest. With only four contestants, in the dunk, what a joke. Had i paid for a ticket to such trash. I would have got a refund.
Steph should be in this contest every year. And i mean every year for the rest of his life.
Dame and Giannis are 2 alphas and it's Giannis' team so integrating Dame is not working as well since Dame needs the ball more. MIL isn't running hardly any pick and role with Dame. Dame is deferring to Giannis and others and not taking his usual instinctual shots to get himself going in games. He is still getting 25 and 7 which is crazy tbh considering the 2nd fiddle he's playing. MIL needs to give him more control to run the show. His 34% is partly bc of the shot selection due to trying to fit in when MIL just needs to let him be him.
#Dame time way to go bucks
Kahit kasali si Curry diyan si curry parin panalo
Sabrina would have smoked these contestants😂
im happy to see dame win
Los coge SC30 y los parte como crayola😬
Ray Allen would’ve dog walked all of them
Curry 29😂
U mfs ruin everything.....can't even watch the contest without y'all tellin us who won first
sabrina laugh watch this tournament....
Congrats to Damian Lillard on winning the 3PT shooting contest.
curry 29 point vs sabrina
Deserved...DAME TIME.
Steph won the mens and woman's 3pt contest 🐐
trae throws brick
I wish I could pull up a video and watch it before knowing who won. What’s the point of watching when yall gon put the picture of the winner
Just ONE person talk, dvmn...
Am I the only one screaming at these mofos to stop standing there looking at the shot before they move on? Specially Malik Beasley. I’m like freaking go bro time is running out 😂😂
Dame nearly choke 🤣
Commentators after the shooters makes consecutive shots “He’s Rolling!!!” Proceeds to miss the next shot 😂
This is boring. Someone would have dominated them all rounds guess who 😂
Wtf is Malik beasly doing here blud think he's a shooter 😒
Dame Time ⌚ The difference is if steph need to put that last one in clutch to win he can't but Dame can do this all the day the greatest clutch shooter #lillard
17:28 hold up
Lol Dame had to make things interesting at the end there
That big green court is hard on my eyes. It's going to fuck up my vision.
Dame seen 2k put his 3pt at a 83 and turnt up 😂
Curry just scored 29 points against Sabrina   If Curry join this 3pt contest he will surely get this one 👨‍🍳
Damn Sabrina shot better than half of these guys.
Nahhhh Dame pulled a Larry Bird
curry glazers are crazy
All of you guys have 26, Steph had 29, and he is not participating.
He lost to both Stephen and Sabrina 😂
If steph is in this contest he probably won
donavan stance looks like Draymond green ahahah
She would’ve tie for first and curry would’ve came out on top.
deymmmmm
Dame time congrats
lol with curry score, he would’ve beat both with one stone. 😂
Steph said hold my beer
Dame should thanks steph, he didnt join that event
In this contest max points are 26 by dame But in Sabrina vs Steph... Steph hits 29... Think if he was to participate in this contest 😂😂
back to back
This is a mannns worllld
They stood around waisting time by looking and watching each and every shot!!!
/timestamp
Im sorry, but Sabrina can even beat all these guy 🤣🤣🤣
Why did u change the rules this sucks
With one round, Steph shows to all of them he’s still the greatest 3-point shooter the league has ever seen. Congrats to Dame though!
Lol. Lillard did that on purpose
kenny was so annoying during this
these announcers need to retire
Dame might be the most ice cold shooter iv ever seen. Yeah stephs the greatest but this man seems to get better when the pressure goes up
should let reggie participate. he woulda schooled em all
Curry scored more than Sabrina and Damian😭
I feel like if i just type "steph" in my message nachtmare will paste his reply like a bot
steph vs sabrina are better than this 3pt contest
dame time!
lmao steph so good, he has a league on his own 😂😂
Dame dolla 🔥🔥🔥
Ofc lil win
This is crazy lol just show the winner in the thumbnail
Caitlin Clark would of wiped em all up and she would have done it from the logo 😅
tyrese jumper so ugly but it's cash
you know who won.. it's on the thumbnail..
I think referee is useless HAHA
Dont play with the best clutch player in NBA history with Lebron.
Why are there so many Steph fanboys here crying? Dawg, he ain't even in this video. Zip it up.
Wow beautiful Floor! So great i love it!
Steph won the contest!
STEP CURRY DID NOT JOIN 3pt contest cause he knows hes gonna lost again to damian😂😂😂
Shoot like kobe dame😅😅 that break-up can't fase you fam💯
Dame ⌚ 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
💯
Everyone knows the real 3 point champion is Steph😂
Not to take anything away from Dame, but everyone knows who the real king is...
I wanna see Reggie back in there
17:08 bug
Dame doing Dame time gesture after bricking 4/5 is funny to me.
Curry had the highest score...so he would have won that
This is just a warm up before the real contest begin. Let's be real 🤣
Now we need a sudden death challenge with Steph v Dame
Love that we have 2 champs tonight with Steph vs Sabrina and then this longer shootout.
Steph won both contests.. got a belt...
Dame missed all of the last rack until the last ball just tk build the suspense 😂
Dame time..but I guess that was a close one 😂😂
Steph scored 29.  So, technically, he won both.
Funny how no one score more than steph this year. They are all lucky he doesn't join the 3pt contest😂 Yet Trae “try hard” Young tried to cheat again like he did a few years ago in skill challenge. Glad Dame win over him. Lmao
Dame time ⏰ ‼️💯
9:51 pauseeeee wtf😂
Spoiler shield 🛡
Practice doesn't makes you perfect
Amazing game
Probably the best 3 point contest ever.
Nah He’s far from Steph😂
Curry still had the highest score bruh
Steph and Sabrina laughing on the side ><
Back to Back For Lillard.🔥🔥🔥
If curry ain't there Dame ain't got no competition
Do you need to put 20 sec ads every 5 fıcking minutes?
DAMMMMEEEEEE TIMEEEEE
We all know Dunk Contest has peaked. Only so many things can do. But by 2024 I would at least think they got the Judging fixed. No reason to have such crappy judging still. Make up scores on second dunks. lol.
This 3-point contest don't count. Steph and Sabrina should've joined this group.
Dame time 😂😂😂
Curry had 29. Amd lets just be real here,steph is the most pure best shooter in the league still
DAMMMME TIME ⌚️
Great 3 point shooter  Steven curry doesn't include in 3 point contest.. what a joke.. worst 3 point contest in the history of basketball..😂😂
9:50 pause on that one kenny
Steph would've won dame isn't him. Dame is not the best lmao
Trae Young 3pt Champ 2025
No sounds?
That green court is leaving me blind
the lasr rack is the most important, especially for brunson haha
Malik?
Now we need a sudden death challenge with Steph v Dame 🔥
We all know 3pt contest is not fun untill steph is part of it
crazy sabrina with 26 did better than all of em lmao
Hoe ass pinned comment spoiled the contest
Sabrina hit 26. better than all of these guys. lmao
Sabrina is bad button👇
So good steph son wins back 2 back 3pt titles
steph is like "that's cute"
Steph and Sabrina was crazy it had me on edge the whole time
Curry should have easily won this if he had competed
Curry hit 29 points haha, he is too good for the contest.
Overrated , ballhog top 75 lol lol lol
Am I trippin or is that a real life robot clown/clone/idk wtf. 17:13
THIS IS SOOO RIGGED KAT SHOULDVE WON
Damn... Dame
That 3PT Contest was 🔥!
Final round Trae shoulda got it, KAT and Dame had a lot of their shots with their feet on the line 🫤🧐
Trade Klank for Dame. EZ FIX.
17:00 OMG😂 dame time⌚️
God has a plan! Jesus loves you! The Holy Spirit guides you!
Glad to see dame didn’t let shooting 34% from three get to his head. Congrats Dame on going back to back 🔥
Bro a lot of those shots by KAT and Dame feet were clearly on the line??
I THOUGHT THIS IS A COMEback OF NBA ALLSTAR WEEKEND. BUT ADAM DID. IT AGAIN. EVERY YEAR IS A SHIT ALLSTAR WEEKEND. LOOK AT THE FLOOR. Its AN EYESORE. ADAM MCU FAV. CHARACTER IS HULK
Dame time reigns supreme in this contest
Just watched Curry cooked Sabrina moments ago. Congrats Dame & Steph 🔥
The best and competitive 3pt contest so far. From the 1st round to tie breaker then to the final round bit still it’s DAME TIME.
Dame is live in indiapolis
Remember that Hes shooting worse than Klay this season
DAME TIME 2X ⌚️⌚️🔥

And STILL!!
2nd best 3-point shooter ever!
