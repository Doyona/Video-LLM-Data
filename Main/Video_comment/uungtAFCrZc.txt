😅 Michael monster truck all make a messy truck  MIESSI
Not sure if you found this out but as you said one of the boards is faster therefore more power so on your test run you were using the less powerful one in the back and the powerful one in front that is why you went faster going backwards because power was on the more powerful board so it could push your better, the front tire is more of an assist. This is shown in cars, most cars don't even have front wheel drive because of the power thing.

Hey Jake I really like your videos because they have two things I like being creative and funny and I was wondering if you could make something fly like maybe make a helicopter or something. Pleaee
I have absolutely no idea how I ended up here. But this has to be one of the stupidest things I have ever watched. Needless to say, I had to turn it off immediately... somewhere around the 6th episode.  😳 🤔 😬 Ok, maybe it was the 8th episode. Anyways, I'll finish them tomorrow. Thanks for the laughs and I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with next.😂
4:43 can someone please tell me where i can find this build up sound effect?

I Love you Jake! You're my favorite designer youtuber! 💗🥰❤
I'd love to see you do a collab with Louis Rossmann, something related to taking something is software or hardware locked and turn it into something awesome like you're known for.   It would showcase the challenges of right to repair and the fruits of human ingenuity. Both of you live close to each other, so it sounds like a great match.
Leon 😍

Bro Jake Carlini’s editing is on another level idk how he does those cool edits
Watch out all skateboards for Carlini. He gonna make you a bike
1 MILLION SUBS
Summarize this video  Thinking about your question...  The video is about a person who decides to build a custom chopper bike despite not being an engineer or mechanic. The protagonist uses two tires, garbage, and a burning desire to create the monster bike. The protagonist faces challenges and setbacks during the building process, including having to trade electric skateboards with their roommate. The video includes dream sequences and a mysterious character named sxis who is spoiling their plans. The protagonist perseveres and successfully completes the monster bike, ready for their next mission.
I love your video please make more big build ideas
Can you build a mini bike out of scratch pls 🙏
He is INSANELY underrated.
I love you BEACAUSE your very creative
-1mil-
You'd make an amazing father
Yo GrindHardPlumbingCo!! been following them for a while, its cool to see the inspiration from them haha

It's fuck in great
I'll to 100 push ups every sing like I get (promise )
I have a idea for you to make a plane
grind hard is building the real deal
I love your videos how long does it take to make and edit one this seems like a lot of work 😮🔥
MAKE A HELICOPTER if you can 👍
Atleast you never have to worry about a flat
Do a plane but not out of cardboard and make it have a motor
Bro is the definition of good editing and making it funny I love this guy 😂
Rim ❌  skateboard✅
Hey, I got a crazy idea for you to build out of trash. How about a Lowrider but there’s only one thing you can’t use trash for the wheels no no no no no no no no you have to use the Dayton Lowrider rims for the wheels and I love it to see it bounce and do a three wheel motion with some big speakers in the back you can use trash for that I don’t even care. This might be your biggest ambitious project yet.
Also I was one of your subscribers before you even hit a 100k.

Why did you change the thumbnail??
hey jake, been watching for a bit, love the videos, and the random lore im an avid engineer myself (never done actual engineering but i understand it) and i had a cool idea Weed Wackers It seems a big problem you keep having is how to power things, you keep needing to destroy other things to build new ones, so, if your willing to try it, you can get gas powered weed wackers for like super cheap, another youtuber, Joel Creates, got one for like 2 dollars i think, and im pretty sure they are super easy to use, so you can probably slap 2 or 4 of them together and make an new engine if your willing
Looks like the bat cycle from Batman
Love your videos brother ☝️🤓
Bro Sold On This One
I got my phone back, AND Jake made a video, today is a good day

I can't believe how much your channel has progressed jake, I've been subbed since 32k. I'm proud of what you've did with this channel and your life and I'm excited to see what else you do with this channel. I'll be a supporter no matter what. But don't forget about us when you get all rich and famous! 😂 ❤ 🎉
it takes a HUGE brain to make those thing out of trash and very litle eletronicks
I loved the mech suit video I LOVE MECH SUITS I recon you should make like a power suit I know you ain't good at electronics but like evey video you stretch your capability and through struggle to impress everybody. Instead of being rich and buying eveything you use trash. Which is better for the environment like honestly you stand out from evey single youtuber that creates things  the time and effort you put into editing, also that clone thing is amazing and I love how you are so funny you add a backstory to your videos which makes it like a movie. Your sponsors are always like just make a movie sort of you always fit them in perfectly normally I skip these sort of ads but like you add alot to it it's just beyond most YouTube normally go you always have now and then goofy bits like just you are beyond. Im not begging ifor you to make a power suit and comlimenting you just so you say yes.i swear hope you see this comment.   -factstem
Green dude is back😦😦😦😦
Very good
Or else.........
who is the real you

Hey Jake I was thinking 💭 maybe you can make a little monster bike kart that’s a hot wheels and it has to have four tires 🛞 if you can do it and if you can add some flames 🔥 on both sides and have some controls that he knows what to do and finally some car doors I’m trying to keep up my best brother of the year award 🥇 Thanks dude you rule so good luck

I just thought of a domain expansion for jake:) It’s called creative thinking. This will allow him to create anything out of trash anywhere in his domain. An example of this is he can create a massive tank under his feet or armor made of steel trash cans. Keep making vids man they are great:)

WWWWWWWWWWWW|
I use to hate welding but once I got the hang of it you feel like you can do anything...and it becomes fun! Do it!!
i love your content can i get pined :)
maybe you could put the 3rd board on the front tyre, but like on the top part of the tyre inwards. and attach both the boards with an extendable rod to make sure that the skateboards are in contact with the tyre tightly. then at the centre of the line joining the 2 boards attach the stick that is connected to the steering handle.  Also maybe look at a bicycle, their steering structure made in a very specific way, research into how a bike balances because of the steering system and i am sure that it will help your monster bike steer better.  also love your videos, specially the lore in between and your positive & cheerful attitude during moments that are sometimes exhausting and frustrating. like i would get frustrated if i couldn't find my bike's handlebars
Wow
Please make a bike camping.
