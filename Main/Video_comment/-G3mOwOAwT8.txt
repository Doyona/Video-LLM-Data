Lil Baby never disappoints! '24' with Money Man is a CLASSIC! Who's still bumping this heat in 2025? I'm obsessed with Lil Baby's non-stop verses and effortless flow - he's the real deal! And can we talk about that infectious 'woooh-woooh' beat drop? Lil Baby's features are always fire, but let's be real... his singles can't compete with his collab magic!🙏❤️

Money Man the best rapper.
Yea yea yea
this shi hard
Dude can really rap harmonically and he lost a lot of weight. Interesting question why he didn’t blow up at any point…not even for a few minutes. He didn’t have it….whatever “it” is. And you can see it if you watch. Baby (combined with his backstory) has it, MM doesn’t. It’s interesting
Kobe forevee
This was, and still is a straight banger!!!!🔥🔥🔥

Only me and a chopper I can make they heart stop if I decide to pop up I can make a million every month and don't drop nothin' I found out a way to make a thousand-dollar profit, uh Pilot say it's smellin' like weed in the cockpit I done made a quarter this week in Huaraches Top model with me tryna feed me hibachi I done got too much to lose, I'm cautious I done ran it up, I got sixteen watches Which one I'ma drive? I got sixteen options Hoppin' out thirty clip, bangin' 4 Pockets
Still hard ‼️

Didn't understand two words from either of these fools ,mumble and autotune. Beat is fire tho. Yo, modern day producers are superheros.

But hey , they make more money than me so it must be cool uh. Lol
The beat is magestic
These niggas flow are diabetic because damn they ate the shit out of every verse
Money man nailed it.. lil baby killed it.. beat is overpowered…

Seeing Lil Baby doing his own thing in the back was funny
Am listening to this song right now. It's a dope song. I thought it's new. Just One week ago one of my friend played this song and I asked him the name of the song, i downloaded the audio and today I decided to come to check the video, I was surprised after seeing it has been 2 years since it was released. I love this song...i have listening to this for the whole week now... repeatedly.  Sorry for my bad english but I hope you got the message.
Next on playlist: higher brothers psy p - ghetto artist

Just discovered this song for the first time and no joke have listened to it on repeat at least 50 times (and counting)
Lol our culture today. Don’t need talent anymore to make a song popular. Just throw in a thousand female booty cheeks and it will get you 4million hits.
To be blunt,🤔 TRUE hip hop niccas know that GUNNA WAS THE 1ST PERSON to start switching his octaves in verses. HE BROUGHT THAT SWAGG and it SHOULD BE HIS PATTON but you weak mfs wouldn't know ANYTHING about a Patton or the business world so I don't see y'all getting it😢 step your intellectual side up lil guys YAXIS
This song still hits hard after 2 years

HOLY BIBLE -- 3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; 4 neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. 5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. 7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.

Oh ya'll came to see what's the ticket with Narwhal too?
We all know Nutella drowned 💀✋🏾
I SAW NUTELLA
Here bc narally said she was in this video and i had to check out the evidence
Who came here for Nutella
I was lookin for Nutella and she said she was in lil baby’s video this isn’t even his song he’s the ft so ofc she in the vid lil baby got higher standards for his video baddies
I'm just here to see nutrition bar
Wait… Is that Narally from Laura and Makayla?!?!😳
Omg Nutella in the video
love the song and the video but narally- EW disgusting😭
I’m sorry but the rest of the girls look way better than Nutella not trying to be rude but I think a lot of people would agree with that.
It the fact Nutella barely getting screen time for me that’s why she ain’t bragging about it 😭😂😂
You see Nutella at 1:37
she was a stripper 😭
POV you here from Laura and Makayla to see where Nutella at
Lol this might explain why Laura was so okay with Nutella getting Laura’s name tatted on her neck. She was hoping next video she’s in would give her some exposure 😂 I have a feeling Nutella doesn’t even make money doing shit like this. They normally pay the girls a couple hundred bucks if anything at all. Some of these rappers get these girls for free just to be in the video. So “model” where?? I guess anyone can be a model these days 😂 Nutella is only pretty with makeup on but her attitude makes her ugly af. Makayla is naturally beautiful. Can’t be compared.
OMG I THOUGHT THEY WAS CAPPING ABT NARALLY BEING ON HERE😭 I stopped the video just to look lmao
Nutella still be looked like trash in the back for a reason lol
i saw nutella like 2 times .
Oh neurally or wtv her name is she was either in the back or at the bottom 😬

For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. (Romans 10:13) Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. (Psalms 51:1-4)
You must be saved by Jesus Christ and baptized to enter heaven there's no other way.
You must be saved by Jesus Christ and baptized to enter heaven there's no other way Jesus Christ is the only way to the father!.

Give money man his respect and recognition tho bro hes BEEN doing this fire ass flow before everyone stole it.
The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. (2 Peter 3:9) Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-10)

Kobe Bryant, R.I.P. 24  I can make a cool 50K in less than twenty-four hours Ridin’ with the pack through the Tennessee mountains  VPN, SOCKS, and at least three routers  I’ma thumb through it, I don’t need no counter  Had to resuscitate a bitch, my neck almost drowned her  I got oil, I got hemp, I got wax, I got flower   Burnin’ on pre-roll, finna go to Pluto  Drippin’ real hard when I’m hoppin’ out two-door  I just met a psychedelic plug named Hugo  Thirty laptops in my motherfuckin’ condo  White collar diamonds, nigga ballin’ like Lonzo These niggas overrated like Joe Flacco  Feelin’ like Jim Jones, nigga, I’m a capo  I’ma flip a Rolls-Royce, I’m feelin’ like Pop Smoke   [Verse 1: Money Man]  Banana Cream Cake in my motherfuckin’ hemp wrap  If I don’t like the smell, then the pack get sent back  If I don’t like his energy, I push a nigga shit back  Making hash oil, listening to Bank, Big Facts  Making hash oil, listening to Scream, Big Facts  All that slick talkin’ finna get a nigga kidnapped  Gelonade got a nigga finna go and lift off  I’ma empty out the magazine when I’m pissed off  I’m on that Wedding Pie, it got me geeked  My bitch hit it twice and then she went to sleep  I drop bud on the clock with the perfect technique  I’ma hit from the rear, I wan’ grab her obliques I ain’t got time in the day for my females be mad at me  Internet racks, I’ma run it up rapidly  She know I’m vicious, I’m fuckin’ her savagely  She know I get racks, she know my mentality  Grew up in the trap watching Kobe yam on a nigga  Pull up in the Porsche, yeah, the Pan’ on a nigga  Yeah, pull up in the Dodge, yeah, the Ram on a nigga  Anybody try, yeah, I’ma blam on niggas  I’m the head bad guy, fifty different gridlines Turn a lacefront to a fire, fire hairline  I was over drippin’, I should start my own clothing line  Got two jits, dawg, I’ll die for both of mine  I ain’t never satisfied ’til my money increase  Fucked up the profile, too many inquiries  They be low-key hatin’, I can hear ’em whispering  All these baguette chains, you can see ’em glimmering  Had to make a U-turn, I just seen a roadblock  I ain’t playin’ no games, I ain’t sparin’ no opps  It’s a full moon now, so I’m burnin’ Moon Rock Livin’ off schemes, why is he on tip-top?   [Chorus: Money Man]  Burnin’ on Lilikoi, ashes look corduroy  R.I.P. Kobe Bryant, R.I.P. 24  I can make a cool 50K in less than twenty-four hours  Ridin’ with the pack through the Tennessee mountains  VPN, SOCKS, and at least three routers  I’ma thumb through it, I don’t need no counter  Had to resuscitate a bitch, my neck almost drowned her  I got oil, I got hemp, I got wax, I got flower   [Verse 2: Lil Baby]  A1 Zone 4, I’m feelin’ like Rocko  Big, big spender, take a jet to Morocco  I got pretty women showin’ titties like I’m Flacko  I came in a hard top, I’m still in the drop, though  I can make the charts drop whenever I wan’ drop somethin’  I can give my big bro a dime, he’ll pop somethin’  These niggas not real slime, they imposter  I know that my opps somewhere now playin’ possum  I come from a different type of cloth, we don’t gossip  Pussy nigga actin’ like it’s up, we’ll chop him  She diggin’ the rocks in my ear, I’m a rockstar  Come from out the trenches, gettin’ paid like a popstar  I be sellin’ weed by the P like a rasta  Who was in the car? Only me and a chopper  I can make they heart stop if I decide to pop up  I can make a million every month and don’t drop nothin’  I found out a way to make a thousand-dollar profit, uh  Pilot say it’s smellin’ like weed in the cockpit  I done made a quarter this week in Huaraches  Top model with me tryna feed me hibachi  I done got too much to lose, I’m cautious  I done ran it up, I got sixteen watches  Which one I’ma drive? I got sixteen options  Hoppin’ out thirty clip, bangin’ 4 Pockets   [Outro: Money Man]  Burnin’ on Lilikoi, ashes look corduroy  R.I.P. Kobe Bryant, R.I.P. 24

COVIDNINETEEN VACINATIONS, THE 1ST STEP TOWARDS THE MARK OF THE BEAST IS HERE SOON. A great and formidable enemy seeks to enter into the very blood of My children through the altering of your DNA. Because of the curse that came about after the fall of the first man Adam, I came to make a way for you. You are renewed and made clean again by your belief and salvation in Me, your King and Messiah, sent by My Father to redeem you by My blood sacrifice on the Cross of Calvary. Only through Me, the Door, corruptible is made incorruptible, unredeemable made redeemable. I have ransomed you in order to bring creation back to its Creator. Creator YHWH was made flesh to overcome death, hell, and the grave, and to take what was tainted and impure and make it whole again. The spiritual battle that is raging now is ultimately to strip you of the Divine image of Myself that has been placed within the DNA of My creation. Ask Me for more wisdom and revelation about this and it will be given to you. The veil was torn, access granted when I shed My blood, died and rose again. We have created you in Our image, and when you walk in holiness, righteousness and purity, obeying My commandments, I am enthroned on your heart. You are then transformed in body, soul and spirit. When this transformation occurs, the very frequency of your cells then resonates with Me and raises you closer to your Creator and further away from the lower realm and lower frequencies which keep you bound. This is by design, and when indwelled, My Holy Spirit will be the gatekeeper of your heart, and your entire being, My sanctuary, and the place where I reside in you. When this occurs, My Kingdom is on earth, as it is in Heaven. It is then that I am able to provide victory over the curse for you, preserving the Divine design I have placed within your DNA. There are many layers of revelation to know what is coded there and hidden, secrets to be revealed to only those who overcome. However, if the gates are breached by sin, lack of obedience, compromise, or lukewarmness, the enemy sets up thrones (strongholds) instead of Me, because my laws, My Word have not been written on your hearts. You have a sworn enemy whose utter mission is to destroy you. He will stop at nothing, and as My Word has foretold, the time is here when the greatest of all violence and evil against My people, those made in My image, is taking place. The battle is for the soul, and the battle is about the blood. Satan’s ultimate goal from the beginning was to corrupt the seed, corrupt the blood that carries My blueprint in you, My design for those made in Our image, your DNA. There is only one way to ensure that My Throne is upon your heart and your eternal destination is sealed, or your soul will be lost forever. Your must be born again. Your heart must be sealed with My blood. You must be quick to repent often and seek holiness above all else. Love what is true and just. Be extremely careful what your eyes see and your ears hear. This is guarding your heart, guarding its gate. It is in sealing these portals to the soul, in commanding the spirit to govern or have mastery over the soul, that you overcome. You will then be prepared for My return, and be protected from the evil one. If you have not already done so, seal the portals to the enemy now! Confess your sins and repent for the midnight hour is here! Bind the access points that have given satan legal rights within your temples, within your body, mind, soul and spirit. Give satan and all his dark kingdom a certificate of divorce and be free from the bondage, and from all the oppression and possession in your bloodline immediately! Break the curse from your ancestors back to Adam. Cover it all with My blood and command the enemy out of your bloodline, sealing it as well, the gates to your heart, using the authority you have been given through Me. Exercise dominion as a gatekeeper and a son or daughter of the Most High God, taking your positions as heirs to My Kingdom. My Holy Spirit will then have permission to use you for My glory and manifest through you in this crucial hour. *(Please see the prayers on the right hand side bar and the one titled Increased Demonic Warfare Prayer covers everything He is instructing here)* This must be done this moment!! This is crucial! Precious moments remain before the implementation of the enemy’s plan to destroy the DNA of My creation, making you forever unredeemable. The Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and it must be taken by force! Take My Holy Word and dispossess what has had control of your gateways and that of your family line through covenants, oaths, soul trades and agreements made by your ancestors. Do it this moment! In Me you will be made FREE! The implementation of the plans to alter your DNA and make it programmable by something other than Me, your Creator, are here. I control and govern the DNA I have placed within you, but if you allow man to administer anything within your bodies, that will recode your DNA, I will no longer be the controller. I will no longer recognize you as My creation. You will have become a mixture of something else, an altered form of man and technology, and therefore, not in My image any longer. Do you understand what I am saying? Truly the hour is here when you must prepare to make the choice to remain fully human, infused with My Spirit. The enemy wants nothing more than to deceive you through propaganda, fear and manipulation and cause you to allow either a mark or an implant (vaccine or digital tattoo) into your bodies that will forever separate you from Me. This is your reality right now! You must know what you will choose to do. When you open doors to the enemy through sin and through your choices in life outside of My ways, the demonic spirits appoint gatekeepers over your heart, your mind, and your soul. Then those spirits invite more, and when no repentance occurs, strongholds occur. The heart of an unregenerate man is wicked and deceitful above all things. But My Word is quick, powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing apart of your soul and spirit, your joints and marrow, as I discern the thoughts and intentions of your heart. Allow Me to write My laws on your heart and you will know truth at last. You will know what is now directly in front of you and the choices that are here for you and your loved ones. My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, but it does NOT have to be this way. Allow My glory to penetrate your spirit so that your soul will come under submission. To not allow this, means you will remain in bondage and you will be easily deceived. If I do not dwell in you fully, and your gates have been breached, another will easily influence you and take governance. My people, I have given you the keys to the Kingdom. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in Heaven and whatever is loosed on earth will be loosed in Heaven. Bind the strongman, bind the strongholds on your life and be delivered! The technology for the mark of the beast is here. It is upon you. It will be presented at first to be taken voluntarily, then very soon after, you will not be able to buy, sell or work. Do not wait another moment. Come out of Babylon and make Me King of your heart, the Divine Gatekeeper of your soul. The evil ones have set in motion their wicked schemes, as it must be so according to My Word. Many, many judgments will occur as I allow them. This is to wake up My church. You must know where you stand in your walk with Me, because in an instant, everything will change, and there will not be another opportunity to choose, because the choice will be made for you. You are either all in, or I am turning you over to your carnal mind and nature. You have the choice My loves, choose life and eternity in Me over eternal death in darkness.The time is now.  YAHUSHUA, JESUS THE CHRIST.  258

@joanne watson it says in the article the african american celebrities in hollywood are using a japanese skin lightening and bleaching lotion that changes their skin color so much lighter that they dont even look black anymore,but they deny it https://matsuiskinlightening.com/products/bleaching-skin-lightening-orange-peeling-lotion-100-ml-top-selling-product i guess they  dont want people to know they use this skin lightening lotion because they just want people to think they are naturally light skinned they should just be honest.
I love lil baby come from thailand 🇹🇭 🔥

Who made this beat
here before 24 million views
This video giving me NBA JAM vibes
Money Man killed it. Its his vibe.
money mans verse is actually insane
King of trap music both of em
He doesn't use autotune he just does something for his voice to sound like that if you look at charlie sloth he did a freestyle with him and you can tell he doing something with his body or something to make him sound like that so all yall hater stfu
1:12 Wtf is wrong wid this shawty
This slap
Moneyman A1
He sound like gunna
look up sheff g weight on me on youtube and listen to the beat, hes a thief
am i the only one who thinks this sounds like YOSEMITE ?

Baby all over.. uuufffff.
Money man out here like sadababy twin 😂

Anyone else put this song on a loop for a whole hour?
Lol i was here when this had 14k veiws...  22M Now
Fire
What bob marley son tryna pull off
chkoun jey men gneyt sanfara 😂
I agree Lil Baby murdered it but Money Man is the OG in this song. His lyrics are passin these new guys up easy
0:43 "I'ma flip the Rolls-Royce, I'm feelin' like Pop Smoke" If you know anything about Pop Smoke, this isn't a compliment to him and he'd call this man a fool for that line. This guy probably didn't mean to disrespect Pop Smoke with that line but if you've seen Pop Smoke's interview when he talked about the Rolls Royce, then you'd know that's a disrespectful line
Had to watch baby verse twice
RIP Kobe 24 Lakers
1:00 and lil babys verse 💨💨💨
Its funny that 5k people actually disliked this.
Money man is so trash I want to kill myself
Gunna would be fire on this track
"I can make a kool 50K in less than 24 hours"!!! - Money Man

I Love Da Track Point Blank, What Made It More Clear Wen He Said Rocco/Morocco Lil Baby Da Truth 💯♥️💪🏾
OK Flacco is overrated but what is lonzo then
LIl baby top 5 rapper of the year
I thought money man was like a 17 year old soundcloud rapper
Lil baby just hit this verse so hard
Why Money Man look like he forgot to take the hanger out his sweater??
Money man went off
Happy independence day Morocco 🇲🇦

Money Man Explains Glass Eye! https://youtu.be/IFJDiefzc7Q
Hello! I am a citizen of US and have been living in Los Angeles I want to sincerely appreciate Ben Hacker who helped me with an already Programmed hacked ATM CARD and I was so poor without funds that I got frustrated. One morning as I was browsing the internet, I saw different comments of people testifying of how Ben Hacker helped them from being poor to rich through this already hacked ATM CARD. I was skeptical if this was true, I decided to contact one of the people giving this testimony to see proof before I contact this hacker, and they proved to me beyond all doubts that its was really for real so I urgently contacted the email: benhacker551@outlook.com if you also want this BLANK ATM CARD I strongly advise you to contact this Hacker now thank you.

Gunna 2.0
RIP KOBE
i saw U down the street https://youtu.be/AqQ2jg4dxAA click to see
🔥🔥🔥
lilbaby could have done this by himself
that beat mixing with baby verse put me on a different planet
This song went hard on every verse lit 💯
Baby said “top model women tryna feed me hibachi”. Let’s break that down: 1. Top model women - the word “top” can mean either “one of the best” or “getting head” 2. Feed me hibachi - models are literally feeding him Hibachi on dates, but “Hibachi” can also mean “to cut” in other words “to have sex”.  Bars.
Lil baby’s verse should’ve been longer
Lil Baby realized the beat have MJ simple on it and went crazy. Respect!!!!
It actually bullshit Money man had to cop that feature to get the proper recognition
I was the snake handler for this video.
Am i the only one who thinks that money man sounds like lil yachty
Play speed 1,75x 👍🏻
Mann Lil Baby on every 2020 song

Run 🏃 it up 💥💥 Initiative Q is an attempt by ex-PayPal guys to create a new payment system instead of payment cards that were designed in the 1950s. The system uses its own currency, the Q, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating Qs for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot. If you missed getting bitcoin seven years ago, you wouldn't want to miss this.  Here is my invite link: https://initiativeq.com/invite/SM2IyMJ6Q  This link will stop working once I’m out of invites.

This go harddddddd🚨🚨🚨🚨
For anybody who has a minute to read I just wanted to let you know that Jesus Christ loves you! Turn away from sinning and tell him that you want to be forgiven. Ask him to grant true repentance. Ask his help to enable you to truly believe in him. Give him your heart. And then tell him that you believe that he is the Son of God and that he died on the cross for your sins and rose three days later. Be water baptized by a true christian in the name of Jesus. He wants to save you!!!
whats wrong with his eyes hhahahahaha
LIL BABY KILLED HIS VERSE 💕🥳🥳🥳

Best lil baby verse ever
“Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.” Deuteronomy 31:6  “You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.” 1 John 4:4  “May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.” Romans @   “I keep my eyes always on the LORD. With him at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.” Psalm 16:8  “’For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the LORD, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.’” Jeremiah @-13  “Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is – his good, pleasing and perfect will.” Romans 12:2  “I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.” John @

Jesus Christ will return very soon. Please put your faith in him, and what he did on the cross. We, as humans, live in a sinful nature. We are sinners, but the good news is that Jesus Christ sacrificed himself so that our sins could be forgiven. The Gospel is 1 Corinthians 15:1-4. Christ died for our sins, and on the third day, he rose from the dead, and ascended into heaven. Jesus loves and accepts everyone. It does not matter who you are or where you come from. He loves you, all you have to do is accept the GIFT that he provided for us. It's a gift that we do not earn ourselves. Not works, but through faith. Please get saved today.

💜💛💯
Me watching this video and dancing like lil baby  because I just made profit of my Bitcoin investment with Wp Spinger Investment goggle.  As warren Buffet says, Small money does not guarantee you a place in this market, investments take time and when you spend big you make back huge profits. No exaggeration it’s the simple law of garbage in garbage out. I started with $5000 back in Jan which was equal to 1.07 BTC and I made 4 BTC in just 1 week of investing. It feels amazing but scary at first  You must have heard of Jonathan Klein the CNN Business Reporter who not only makes his money being a correspondent but makes a ton of money from investments he is the most qualified pro-trader and stock marketer. He has spent the last three decades predicting for top firms like Barclays, Amazon and even though some marketers try to put wool over the eyes of new investors with their various Greek gift packages  Jonathan has put together a video of 5 things you should look out for before investing your money and it is absolutely free. Just send a message to kleinjohnathanj@gmail.com at anytime to get help with investing and earning your way into financial freedom.
I gotta roll one every time when this come on the play list ❤🎶

Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I have sinned against you and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, placing my Faith and Trust in You as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have placed your faith in Jesus Christ and meant it with all of your heart, you are now a child of God and will go to heaven. Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism

I heard this song 7 months ago still fire
Moment of silence for those who still can't find this song
18 For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 19 For it is written:  “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, And bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.”  25 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.  27 But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty; 28 and the [m]base things of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things that are, 29 that no flesh should glory in His presence. 30 But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God—and righteousness and sanctification and redemption— 31 that, as it is written, “He who glories, let him glory in the Lord.”
that take a jet to Morocco prolly one of the hardest lines I done heard in a minute

According to American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, many of the rap lyrics contribute to the suicide, violence, and inappropriate sexual content in lyrics that also influence and contribute to teens taking part in drugs and alcohol in a younger age

Something else for you. If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.    God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16    God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO's are real... Soon the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific.  Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, he loves you, open your heart take a chance receive Jesus as your savior.
boss shit💉🤘

Why money man so damn stiff 💀
PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I have sinned against you and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, placing my Faith and Trust in You as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have placed your faith in Jesus Christ and meant it with all of your heart, you are now a child of God and will go to heaven. Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism

Money Man so underated
The one which is and which was and which is to come, the Almighty has come in the flesh to save mankind. For in him, who was from the beginning, was life, and that life was the light of men. He is that true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not. He came unto his own and his own people received him not. Therefore, the gates of mercy and grace and have been extended to all, as many as would receive him, who are born, not of blood, nor of the will of man, nor of the will of the flesh, but of GOD.   The eternal almighty God is a spirit and they that worship him must worship in spirit and in truth. He begat a Son, and called him by his own name, JESUS. For he came in the flesh and into the world to save those them that are lost.   The whole world is covered in gross darkness and it is void of life, truth, righteousness, and godliness. The world is filled with violence, lust, covetousness, idolatry, sorcery, lies, thefts, murders, envyings, revellings, perverseness, and every abomination in the sight of the living God.   But God, rich in mercy, sent his only begotten Son into the world and he willingly gave his life, to bleed and to die on a cross for the sins of the world. For the wages of sin is DEATH and the unrighteous and the wicked shall be turned into HELL. For sin and death spread to all by one man, by whom the whole world came, Adam, even so shall righteousness and life come to as many as will receive the Prince of Life, Jesus Christ. Now, the saints of the Lord Jesus Christ, who have come to that true light which was from the very beginning, have been washed clean and have made their garments spotless by the blood of the holy lamb of God that was slain for the sins of the world. Moreover, they have received the Spirit of Jesus Christ, whereby they live holy and righteous abstaining from every appearance of evil and now have the same Spirit dwelling in them that quickened the mortal body of Jesus Christ their Lord and Savior. For it was not possible that death and the grave should keep the Lord Jesus Christ, for death is reserved for the wicked and he was without sin. Therefore, God raised up his Son from the grave on the third day of his burial and seated him at his own right hand, all power in heaven and in earth given unto the Son of God. And that he should rule ALL the nations with a rod of iron and return in due time with his holy saints to take vengeance on all they that know not God and obey not the gospel of Jesus Christ.   Today is the day of salvation and I’m sent of God to preach the way of salvation to sinners. The false gospel of “Accepting Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior” never made you a saint because it was a lie taught to you by the a world who knows not the way, the truth, and the life. But the gospel which I preach, the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, is the POWER OF GOD UNTO SALVATION TO EVERYONE THAT BELIEVETH, TO THE JEW FIRST AND ALSO TO THE GREEK.  I tell you all, REPENT AND BE BAPTIZED EVERYONE OF YOU IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST FOR THE REMISSION OF SINS AND YE SHALL RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST.   Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he CANNOT enter into the kingdom of God.   Take heed, fear God, and do his commands, for this is the whole duty of man. Blessed are they that do his commandments, that  they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates and into the that holy city.

*Hey... to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” *www.soul.fish*
Every single hip hop track that has come out in the last 10 years sounds the same. It's like being caught in a shitty never ending loop.
🔥🔥🔥
The beat go crazy
For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in our Lord Jesus Christ
Baby
Lil baby be harder than ever🔥🔥
YOU are loved and in need of a savior , we are living in the last days . Please don’t turn away from God he is calling YOU. Deep down you know there is a higher power , a higher creator . John 3:16 , for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life . Repent of your sins , accept Christ as your savior . Believe with your heart and confess with your mouth that you have sinned , we have all sinned and fall short of the glory of God.  Believe that God sent his only son to die on the cross for your sins , the price of our sins was paid in full  ! Accept his gift and you will have an eternity with him.

Because of the increasing rate that prophecy is being fulfilled, this world is quickly coming to a close. The great tribulation is about to begin, the worst time this world will ever know. God the Father wants to have a relationship with His creation. But everyone is born into sin and we need a way for us to be able to live eternally with the Father in heaven. Jesus made that way. Even though He is God, He left heaven and came to earth to be a sacrifice for a lost world. He never sinned. He was abandoned by His friends, was betrayed by Judas and handed over to be crucified. He was beaten so badly that He could not be recognized as a man. Then He willingly suffered an agonizing drawn out death on the cross. He was buried and on the third day God raised Him from the dead. And now He sits at the right hand of the Father and He is coming back any day now to Take home those who belong to Him. Just believe that He died for your sins.  You don't have to repent of sins. People who teach that, are wrong and they are not saved.  You don't have to give up drinking or drugs, etc. Just have faith that Jesus fully paid the price. After you are saved rest in Jesus' sacrifice. God will guide you and help you get rid of bad habits and to do good works according to His will. If you think you should do works, you're saying Jesus' sacrifice was not enough. Faith plus works will NOT save you. Once you believe that Jesus died for your sins, you will receive the Holy Spirit and you are sealed for eternity. Nothing you do or don't do can cause you to lose your salvation. Those who say that you can lose it are not saved. There is nothing we can do! It's all about what Jesus did! God gave us free will but He is a just God.  Rejecting salvation means an agonizing eternity in hell! In the great tribulation, the age of grace will be over and to be saved you must believe on Jesus plus resist taking the mark of the beast. Believe on Jesus now and you will escape having to go through the great tribulation!        For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16
Yeah

What Is the Romans Road to Salvation? “The Romans Road is a sort of roadmap through various gospel truths that someone, years ago, put together by selecting key verses out of Romans.” God’s plan for human salvation is communicated throughout the entirety of Scripture. For the most part, the Romans Road consists of essentially four parts. The Romans Road Bible Verses 1. The Human Problem (Romans 3:10, Romans 3:23, and Romans 6:23). The first part of the Romans Road confirms the state of every human as sinful and the state of God as holy. “As it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one;” (Romans 3:10) “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,” (Romans 3:23) After establishing that “all have sinned,” the first half of Romans 6:23 explains the depth of this problem and its consequences. “For the wages of sin is death…” (Romans 6:23a) However, the second half of the verse hints at the hope sinners have for salvation through Jesus. “…but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 6:23b) 2. Humanity’s Hope in Christ (Romans 5:8). The second part of the Romans Road further explains the hope we have in the love of God expressed through Christ.  “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:8) 3. The Sinner’s Response (Romans 10:9-10 and Romans 10:13). Once we understand our need for a savior and recognize that Jesus Christ is that savior, we can respond by moving along to the third part of the Romans Road, calling out to Jesus. “If you declare with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.” (Romans 10:9-10) This response is possible for everyone. Romans 10:13 expresses God’s ability to save everyone. (His intention to save everyone is further expressed in John 3:16-17) “For, ‘Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.’” (Romans 10:13) 4. The Result of Salvation (Romans 5:1-2; Romans 8:1). The fourth part of the Romans Road mentions two results (peace and justification) after a sinner decides to declare and believe in their heart that Jesus Christ is Lord. Romans 5:1-2 explains that through faith in Jesus Christ, sinners can enjoy peace with God, no longer separated from holy God by sin. “Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand.” (Romans 5:1-2)  Romans 8:1 rejoices in the result of salvation. Before faith in Christ, all who have sinned were condemned by their sin and destined for death. But now with faith in Christ, “there is no condemnation” (Romans 8:1) and believers are gifted eternal life with God (Romans 6:23). “Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,” (Romans 8:1)

2 Peter 3:3-4 King James Version *Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.*  Be not deceived. The Lord will be coming to snatch away His believers very soon. Unless you put your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, you will burn in hell for all eternity.
I wonder how he can understand himself the way he mumbles everything

Remember that JESUS CHRIST died on the cross for every person’s sins on this earth and resurrected on the 3rd day in Glory to give us a way to salvation for eternity to be with Him. ““ Yes, GOD loved the world so much that HE gave HIS only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him would not perish but have eternal life”” John 3:16-17.JESUS The MESSIAH our Savior is coming soon for those who believe in Him, repent of all sin and to sin no more, accept JESUS in their life, and live a life of righteousness as HE commands us to. Jesus loves each and every one of us. Repent and turn your life to JESUS, read the bible, live well in JESUS CHRIST’S name as HE is the ONLY way to salvation. Please do not turn away from Jesus christ. Tell JESUS that you admit you are a sinner as we all are, You admit that you need Him, Tell Him you accept HIm into your heart and life as your ONLY LORD and SAVIOR and KING because HE is Lord, tell Him to wash your garments clean and wash away all uncleanness, worldliness, and sin from your heart including the things that only He can see to purify everything of you and your spiritual heart, Tell Him to write your name in the book of life, to command All of you, your soul, and spirit to never leave his righteousness path that leads to Him. AMEN.

https://youtu.be/2z0TV1hE_ZE
What language are they speaking?  Just remember sheeple, that none of these so called “rappers” will be remembered 5 years down the road.  They are an embarrassment to the past legends and emcees who paved the way for hip hop.  All this is, is commercial radio nonsense.  Just more of the same bullshit.  Ass, drugs, money, hoes.  Like there hasn’t been already 500 niggas that haven’t “rapped” about this shit.  It’s one thing to sell your soul to the record industry for a little fame and money but will never have be remembered or sit on the thrown like true emcees who perfect their craft.
Lil Baby : Isn’t this Gunna beat? Money man : Shit just rap
Why the reticulated pythons in the back

Who else been listening to this song since day 1 💯
This is the Most Important post you will ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve all lied and we’ve all stolen, which makes us liars & thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that even breaking just one of these commandment makes us guilty of breaking them all.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth  Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, & endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace; except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..  So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, & through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, & the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved.  The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, & also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written(Hebrews 9 : 27);   ‘it is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .  All glory honor & praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
Song cold

The escape from what is gives me not only conflict, because it is divisive, it helps me not to understand this thing called loneliness. My self-centered activity has brought about this sense of isolation, which I call loneliness that loneliness is not separate from me.

Why sada baby change his name?
Clylt
Money Mann Is Next Real talk..... Tha Rap Game is Money
BELIEVE IN JESUS! SATAN HAS DECEIVED YOU! Repent of your sins, we’re living in biblical times. Don’t follow the crowd straight to hell. Separate yourself from all these satanic minions. To many of you, these words will not mean anything, this message is not for you. But for the ones who know God, and want to enter God’s kingdom, believe in Jesus. God, in the flesh of Jesus, died brutally on the cross for your sins, so that you can enter heaven sin free. He loves me and you that much!! Time is ticking, it’s never too late.
Friends, did you know that Father God's works are marvelous, and so is He? I am not the first of God's people to praise Him while admiring His unique creations. The writer of Psalms 104 sings of the Lord's many works of art and nature (v.24). He regards "the sea, vast and spacious, teeming with creatures beyond number" (v.25) and rejoices in God for providing constant and complete care for His masterpieces (v.27-31). Considering the majesty of the God-given life around him, the psalmist burst with worshipful gratitude: "I will sing to the Lord all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live" (v.33).            While reflecting on the Lord's magnificent and immense creations, we can look closely at His intentional creativity and attention to detail. And like the psalmist, we can sing to our Creator with thankful praise for how powerful, majestic and loving He is and always will be Hallelujah!                                      Precious one, you are apart of God's perfect creation. You were made in His image with unconditional love. Welcome the righteousness of Yeshua (Jesus Christ) into your life. Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord of your life. Receive grace through faith by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection for the sins of all mankind. You will then be sealed, secured and justified in salvation. You will be rewarded greatly and your life will be forever changed! God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior.❤️❤️❤️

I still don’t know the right words to express my Gratitude to the Great Dr Agbonifo. After been diagnosed of HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS in 2018, i was given so many health prescription and advice with no improvement, I totally lost hope, until i found testimonies of Great Dr Agbonifo in an Online research and on Facebook, Like anybody would be, I was very sceptical about contacting him, but i later did and he opened up to me and told me what was involved and he started the remedies for my health. Thank God, i was cured from herpes by the herbal medication I received from him. I never thought that herpes can be cured, from the bottom of my heart I'm truly grateful,i pray you have long life so you can help many more people on earth with your herbal medical support. Contact the Great Dr Agbonifo today, Dragbonifo @ outlook . com mobile: +2349034749874.

These mfs floating
This is the Most Important post you will ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve all lied and we’ve all stolen, which makes us liars & thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that even breaking just one of these commandment makes us guilty of breaking them all.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth  Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, & endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace; except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..  So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, & through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, & the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved.  The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, & also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written(Hebrews 9 : 27);   ‘it is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’  .

If you are seeing this comment then i just wanted to inform you that i am so proud to  be the 2,177th comment on this video. It has taken years and much effort to be the 2,177th comment. firstly, i would like to thank you for helping me get this rank. I now have a few dedications. First, i would like to dedicate my mother, for helping me in all the bad times like when i fell off a tree 4 years ago. Next, i dedicate my dad for getting me a bycicle when i was 4 years old. I would like to thank my two sisters for taking the blame for me, when i dropped my mother's vase a few days ago. I would like to thank my school bus because, without it, i couldn't have gone to school every morning. I would like to thank the tree in my back yard for the tree sap that i accidentally licked when i was 7 years old. I would like to thank my gold fish that i had when i was 9 years old for swimming around its bowl. And again, i would like to thank you all for reading this special speech and letting me get this rank in this video.
I need money man and gunna to make a song, the vibe plus flow on that would be crazy
