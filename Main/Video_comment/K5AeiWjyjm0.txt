Can't believe it's a year ago today. I remember this as if it was only yesterday. Sharp's double worked wonders that night.
Dale que siiii
Great result for the fab Blades
Amazing forward and goal scorer Billy Sharp ! He seems undying...greetins from Argentina
Next two confirmed epl promotion team:- 1.Fulham 2.Bournmouth 3.Among Westbrom,Blackburn, Nottingham forest, Sheffield Utd, Hudersfield, QPR!!  Nottingham forest/Qpr/Sheffield are my favourite wanna see one of this team to get promoted lets see.
why can't the commentator say, Johnston?
Bruce will take the Baggies down to mid-table. An absolute clown.
There was a great build up to the second goal. Why cut 10-15 seconds of great play out of the highlights?
Sharp MVP
the baggies where sitting in 6th with SB relegation is a possibility he is the worse manager just behind pardew and macarthy
Billy “ The record man” Sharp⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️🥅No. 1 No🤔The Blades no. 10⚔️❤️👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I've been to the game last night with my dad and bro. It was awesome!
Billy Sharp our King ❤ Up the Blades
That tackle by Baldock...just wow. Billy should have hit his hat trick.  What a performance !!
C'mon blades!!🔴⚪🔴⚪
WBA keeper so unlucky to be on the losing side.
Felt like they were on par for a 4 nil
Give me twitter back
Amazing game, Baldock flying.
Has Billy Sharp just done the Lewandowski’s celebration?
I can’t see either team staying up next year if you get promoted and if this is the sort of defending and attacking brought into the Prem…
Where's the red card? Pretending you won the game against 11 men. Laughable.
As a Wolves fan it is good to see MGW playing with confidence and hilarious to see West Brom clogging their way down the table. Bruce won't save them without money, which is why their owner waited for January to pass before firing the previous guy.
No wonder west brom are struggling with performances like this Millwall had the same result as the blades and both are average teams.
There was a great build up to the second goal. Why cut 10-15 seconds of great play out of the highlights?
Awful highlights. Like the team really. Lucky win
Isnt this just proof slavisa jokanavic wanted to embarrass us
Shoreham boys we are here!
Should have shown the red card​ incident and the sending off of the West Brom player for the SHOCKING shocking tackle. Another two goals for the goal machine Billy Sharp, the second goal an absolute beauty, the build up and the awesome strike WONDERFUL :) UP THE MIGHTY BLADES ⚔️⚔️⚔️
Think we are both gonna be in this league for a while .
I presume Mr Bruce will say it was definitely not a red card 😂😂
Not A Goal At Scrappy At All
Diangana missed a sitter, another WBA goal ruled offside, Sam Johnstone MOTM performance.  Good to see the Baggies playing it on the ground.  The results will come.  Go Steves!
Death, taxes, Billy Sharp scores goals.    Better luck next time Cabbage Head.
Billy Sharp is On🔥
Was asleep for this. Match. What a result to wake upto
Steve Bruce 1st game: poor start with a loss. 😱
The shit show also called Steve Bruce Conutinues at West Bromwich this time.bruce is so shit
Sharps not good, West Brom were terrible, but utd are not a great team.
Good to see the blades get it back together. Would have been a shame to see what Wilder implemented just fade away
Hasn't shown the red card 😕
Why do they never show the red cards? Pretty important part of the way the game played out... UTB
great win
I don't want to get too excited. But....
A different result against West Brom  after the 4-0: hammering we got with Sven in charge. Well done Billy, stretch that goalscoring record.
Been waiting up to see the goals again.. well done media team you can get to sleep now! Goodnight blades! ⚔️
No red card shown or build up for either of the goals 🥲… what a performance though
Why not show the red card?
Cheer up Stevie Bruce   oh what can it mean, to a fat piggy bastard   and a shit football team 😅
I love how Billy is like to Gibbs White: Well if you weren't gonna score I fucking will
Go Blades ⚔️⚔️⚔️
One of the best games of the season UTB onwards and upwards ⚔️
