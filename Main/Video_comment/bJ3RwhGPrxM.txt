In that 433 we get 2 extra attacking players might as well be a 5-5 😂 5 defenders and 5 attacks
I always love Roy Keanes loyalty to ITV. Gave him the punditry job before anyone
I think they should play 4-3-2-1
Foden’s development and game management has been handled really well by City. He’s not stagnated or been thrust in too early. He’s coming in gradually and getting rests also, he could be England’s best player that I’ve seen if he stays hungry.
I think Southgate needs to look at formation in the same way i believe guardiola does.by this I mean being able to switch formation fluidly during a match.when we see the set formation it's like right that's it,4 3 3,play in your position and stick to it.whereas I believe pep instills in his team's how to switch position during play.now to be able to play like this you have to have the right players.clever players or can run all day.you can see this in the type of players he brings into the team.most if not all of them don't stick to a certain position.they know if they go out of position that someone's gonna cover that space so they don't have to worry.always moving.not tikky tak passing but more like,I'd call it total football.and if you start off with 5 3 2 or 3 5 2 then you can switch quite well into other formations.
Cant wait to see him play as a CB
I think wright meant Jack Wilshire
pop
Love these two guys  brilliant together
As a Irish man I feel England have stolen 2 great players of us. But we have been taking English born players since the 80s so good luck with them 😀
The Next Gazza
Mings has fucking no chance now stones is on form
Kane CF, Sancho at LW and Sterling/CHO/Greenwood at RW and 2 of 3 out of Foden/Grealish/Madison need to be the xi for every game.
Foden is class. He could find space in a single bed with gemma collins
No one can do what he can in the England teams sorry but Roy kean is unfair and with him in the team we could win something
20 years from now Everyone outside of England : "Foden was better" Chelsea fans : "Rice was better"  Liverpool fans : "Gerrrrraaard was better"
They gassed Foden up juss to then look at future teams that he's not even in loooooool.
How are they not putting hendo in the teams Gareth Southgate is rubbish if we got to anything less than a semi final with the teams we played is a disappointment we should’ve beat Croatia to
Darlow TAA Konsa Coady Chilwell  Rice Henderson Sterling Grealish Sancho Kane   Bring on Foden, Rashford and Phillips  Rotate CBs with Maguire, RB with R James and ST with DCL and Watkins
Here we go again . Hype up an English player who's at best good. Next thing, start pulling him down.
Rashford is not good enough to start for England. Put Grealish on the left and Foden down the middle. Put Sancho on the left and Grealish in the middle. I'm sorry but Rashford just isn't a more effective player than Sancho or Grealish on the wing.
What ever you do don't call him a idiot! Those city boys are a little bit sensitive!!!
Every one it’s Iceland.
Rashford kane sterling              Foden        Rice   TAA Chilwell Maguire Gomez walker                Henderson
funny video of roy keane dancing 😂😂😂  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmON_k2_1bs
Its been mentioned so many times.. that u cant leave Mr. Fridge in a back 4..
Mount is not a CM. Dont be stupid.
How come England came third, with a better goal difference than Denmark?
Euros is a write-off due to an imbalanced team. Be good for these kids to get some experience and hopefully we can find some decent CB's CM's and world class GK over the next several years.
England are shite
Remove Rashford and ensure starts for Kane Sterling Grealish and Foden
Prospective ballon d'or winner
English player does well Pundits: he’s so much like *insert random player here*
One Fantastic Performance Deserves Another! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os89vEwDTaw Don't forget to Subscribe!
Imagine having AWB instead of Walker in the 3-4-3 him and TAA on the right would be a mad combo I think wan bissaka could do well as a RCB
Got decent players and I only mean DECENT with this manager we are going nowhere ..Do me a favour Wright Mason mount not good enough.not beating the bigger teams are we.
Everyone knows what’s coming. Underperforming at Euros through idiotic selection and formation. Southgate sacked.
Maddison and Foden> Ratty Grealish
Stop taken our Liverpool players it’s a waste of time and risking injury’s club before England..
If you didn't know, this video you've made you think he'd put in an amazing performance vs Belgium or France. Iceland ffs.
Henderson?
if southgate goes with a 5-3-2 in the euros with 2 DM's or a 3-4-3 again with mount and rice, no grealish or foden, or Sancho, it was show what a negative backward manager he is, with all the attacking talent and creativity at his disposal, im a Manchester united fan but foden and grealish have to start with Declan rice behind them, and than have Sancho, kane and sterling up front with rashford and greenwood to come on, you could even play saka in a front 3 as he is so versatile. and If you are going to play a back 5 gareth, please don't play 2 DM's in front of that and leave grealish and foden on the bench, southgate is not the progressive coach he is made out to be, and was the wrong coach for the job. most premier league coaches would have got to the semi finals of the 2018 world cup with the opposition England were up against. we have a better crop of players to choose from now than in 2018 so we can play more technical and continental style football, I would even give angel gomes a game, before Portugal snap him up, its not just southgate who aint good enough, neither is ole, man would rather play Lingard and dan james than angel gomes last season, who don't have anywhere near the natural talent that angel gomes has.
me and foden will win the world cup for England
People are sleeping on James Maddison at the minute seems like he’s been forgotten because of his injury
Here we go again with the England hype. We know where it ends
Watching England now is like watching the Under 21 team.
Phil Fidel is bollocks
Can’t wait for them to be ‘in a transition’ or ‘building new talent’ when they play someone decent.
Am a Manchester United fan but i can see foden is going to be the best  center mid in the prem in a years time if he gets first team regular
Footballs coming home
4 2 3 1 gives me a hard on.
Rashford?! Get him out ffs sancho in there
Foden, Grealish, Kane, Rice, Sterling, Sancho all need to play. You pick the rest around that.
I have seen this so many times over the last 30  years , the one constant is a ever changing world is England will end up disappointing..
Keanes got a scotland top on under that tshirt
Henderson is a must in midfield. Like he is for Liverpool
Midfield diamond  with winks  grealish foden mount, winks holding and other 3 interchanging positions Kane sterling uptop
He's good but he's no Dennis Irwin!
He's no Dennis Irwin though ay Roy
Not English so no dog in this fight but it’s gotta be Foden over Mount every day of the week. Surely.
Why do all 3 teams have mount in? What on earth is going on. 🤣 Obviously Henderson starts when fit, and Rashford is our 2nd choice striker, not our first choice LW....
Just another jack wilshere
Thank you Pep 😀
Southgate is gonna miss like when he missed that penalty.
Him and Grealish are the craft and guile England have been looking for a long time to push on.
Rice and Mount in the team over Henderson 😂 and rashford over sancho? Too many clueless people in the job
Foden is quality
Pressure free match, nuff said.
Put Reece James in the double pivot
Terrific attacking talent. Great fullbacks.  Just need a better central midfielder and a top class centreback....oh and a new manager
The best way to defend is by having the ball. International footy is slower paced, so dont worry so much about a shield for the back four in the middle. Focus on setting up a system to encourage movement between lines and to use space all across the pitch.  -------- | Dean Henderson | -------- -------- | Maguire | Mings | -------- TAA | Jordan Henderson | Chillwell ----- | Sterling | Grealish | Foden | ----- ---------- | Rashford | Kane | ----------
I don’t really watch international football but that’s our Stockport iniesta shining for England.
England has always had great players. But that didnt translate to trophies. So it follows that more great players wont change anything.
Need to look at getting james Maddison in the squad absolute class player
What about Madison from Leicester City 😙😙
https://youtu.be/uEo3rnU12jw
England world beaters again 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
No Henderson in any of the teams they put up😅🙈
England could win this  Every news outlet: WRITE THAT DOWN!
Rashford isnt better than sancho
Who like me skipped Ian Wright talking?
Southgate is a moron. Why persist with 343 just to accommodate walker (useless defender) at cb. His best formation was 433 which is so much better.
We need a different manager
Let’s have it right, Southgate is a crap manager
Rice and mount ahead of Henderson..Madness
Just another Jack Wilshire

Roy Keane walks into a bar...  Barman: “like a pint sir?” Keane: DATS YUR JOB
Phill Foden over mount all day every day
scholes was never that good
Jack wilshere was that good too
Walker is England’s best defender and has been for 12 months.  How’s he not making most of those teams? Even if he’s playing centre half, he has to start.
A tree at the back? Fair play.
I think he meant jack wilshere not jack grealish😂
Sancho hendo maguire Kane are the first 4 names on the sheet if we got a fully fit team the 3-4-3 works grealish is over hyped what did he actually do in these 3 games we’ve just played set 1 goal up n get fouled a lot foden bags a assist and 2 goals I like jack I think he’s quality for villa but atm he’s a bench player for England when you got sterling rashford sancho mount foden all players that can play where he plays the way jack plays bringing him off the bench to run at tired legs is his best bet doesn’t have enough end product and Kane’s ineffective when he plays
Foden is technically brilliant, and has all the attributes to really fulfill his potential. Hope he does with me being a City Fan. completely!
Phil foden is playing on the wrong side of manchester
In me 40’s now and I’ve heard all this shite time after time after time.
I think we should play a 3-5-2 with wing backs. Heres my XI                                               Pope                     Coady          Maguire         Mings Trent              Hendo              Rice                  Chillwell                                           Grealish                                  Kane                 Rashford   Important features of this team would be the relationship of Henderson and Trent to help build the play on the right and the sweeping diagonal balls from Coady to Rashford as an outlet ball.
Getting these good goals again teams we should be beating easy anyway when it comes to the world class opposition games non of these players can score them type of goals so non of our players are world class it's as clear as black and white.
Pickford in goal can't stop laughing he's shit
Surely Sakas gotta play over Chilwell in that wing-back role going forward?
Do it against Belgium or Spain or italy
Pretty sure Wright meant to say Wilshere, not Grealish
Play Henderson or Pope instead of Pickford, play Wann Bissaka in Kyle Walker role.
Foden given the peace to just go an perform unlike the agenda against greenwood smh
Phil compared to Paul scholes ia a massive complient  hope he goes onto have a brilliant career Lee Hambleton from Sheffield
Massively talented young man & great to watch. His "mistake" really needs to be put into perspective .. he ate Haribos with a girl ... big fuckin deal!! Didn't get drunk, didn't take drugs, didn't hurt anyone. Move on.
Keep it simple - best XI in their best positions:                      Pope TAA   Gomez   Maguire   Chilwell                    Phillips (/Rice, Hendo)          Foden        Mount    Sterling                         Grealish                      Kane
Tow ads from the start and tow ads in the end 😳.  YouTube is really comfortable.
The goals England scored today wouldn't have gone in if they were in a major tournament.
What difficulties has he come back from?
I would play 4-2-3-1 but have Rice and Henderson, two good defensive players but Henderson keeps the ball moving quickly and helps the right sided players out like he does for Liverpool and That allows TAA to get forward and help Sterling as he knows Henderson will sit on that right side for him incase the ball is turned over. We absolutely must not play 3-4-3 as it leaves us short in attacking midfield imo.
I'm sorry but Chilwell isn't going to that starting XI. Saka is a much better option from now onwards bring him with Foden and Grealish in the team.
They slipped Dier into that 3rd team like we wouldn't notice.
Last time Forden was on England duty he also got 2 balls in an Icelandic goal
Henderson starts all day long
Foden is an unbelievable prospect. Fabulous player.
Future England captain
Sancho instead of Rashford for me
Doesn't matter if southgate won't play him. Look at the Belgium game
Mark Pougatch needs his adanoides sorted.
Its against 🇮🇸  dont get too carried away. Its England  we shite
Foden is technically brilliant, and has all the attributes to really fulfill his potential. Hope he does with me being a City Fan. Great critiques from Ian & Roy. 🙏🏾💫👍🏾😄 You're more than welcome.
Should be played more just like Scholes was
Wrighty is right on the formation
Sterling is a fraud, play Sancho I don't want more Harrowk videos on him.
And we lost to Belgium
Roy keane always has to mention another united player. Bore off mate your team is finished and has been finished for years. Get over yourself
Henderson & Sancho have to start
England must win something  The talent we have now is just insane Forden, grealish, sancho, sterling, Rushford, kane, Alexander Arnold, gomez, Henderson, then we forget midfielders who are injured or off form like chamberlain or dele ali etc So much talent to choose from
Has Ian Wright become slightly better as a pundit? He doesn't seem as bad as he used to be.
Mason Mount should be nowhere near that team🤣
Foden is class. But lads, it was Iceland
I have no faith in any outfield formation, while we have Pickford at #1
Foden, Grealish, Saka, all terrific last night . Still big issues in the England squad. The amount of backwards passing is frightening. Very little movement with the ball and not enough making space, just tic-tacing the ball until space becomes available. Good result but this is exactly the type of play that will have us closed down by attacking teams in the Euros. Kane was shocking last night and against Belgium, Walker hasn’t been inspiring for a while. A 4-0 against Iceland is absolutely nothing to celebrate having just been edged out of the nations league by Belgium yet this is the mind set instilled by Southgate. This new ‘golden generation’ is going to be the international equivalent of Spurs, a serious team with absolutely no silverware to show for it.
Typical pundits getting carried away again. It happens in the run up to every tournament and then they tear them to pieces when they fail to live up to the hype which in fairness the players never ask for.
Declan rice wtf
So after Foden has a great performance there not having him in the first 11! I suppose it's a nice problem for England so not all bad...
England great looking squad, hopeless looking manager. If you don't get to a semi in the Euros ye have had a disastrous year.
Imagine putting Rice, Mount etc over Henderson - the captain and regular for the PL champions & CL winner.    Henderson is the first CM on the teamsheet and should be captain.
"England could do very very well" - so it's the quarter finals again.
bloody hell roy keane got something good to say who would of ever thought it was possible
International football is so shit so fucking boring.
If most teams (and they are) are playing 343 or 352, 4231 just ain’t gonna work out. Always going to be stretched in midfield and Kane will get isolated against 3 defenders
All those formations have excluded Foden. In reality, for me it'd be Rashford out and Graelish on the wing. I'd also currently have Calvert-Lewin over Kane but the Euros is still 7 months away. Plenty time to change my mind.
Imagine Foden and Grealish.....
Southgate clearly has his favorites and it's already clear he is going to try and squeeze them into formations and positions that don't necessarily suit their individual game. Easy to get away with this against Iceland won't be that straightforward against better opposition.
Its unreal to think foden has already got 2 Premier league medals in his bedside draw and he is only 20.
the 4231 looks great buit Dier can fucking do one.
Scored 2 against the mighty Iceland now he is the best player in the world.🤭🤭
I don’t get Sterling is creative, rashford and Sancho! Also Sancho should start without a doubt
Southgate in a previous interview that he knows how the pundit work, they always need to find a story to gain attention or spark "discussion" because of this, they always seem out of touch with public or fans. The fans don't give a sh#t about formations or the players that were not paying. All we want, is to be entertained.
Foden over mount... mount don’t pass when he’s meant to and shoots when he should pass
Spain would hammer England
All aboard the hype trainnnnn!
no matter what the formation, you are insane not to start hendo
They beat 10 man Iceland and Wright says they can go far lol they will fall flat on there face when the top country's come along
All those formations shown have Rashford in the starting XI playing on the left, surely Grealish, Sterling or Mount will be ahead of Rashford in the pecking order for that position.  All he does is shoot from 30 yards five times a match anyway, he's much better as a sub, I'm my opinion.  I know he can do no wrong atm in the English media but he's been awful for a year honestly.
4:23 okkayyy someone's about to have a fit! 😆
Rice over Henderson? What are these man smoking?
I was thinking exactly the same as Ian's formation, apart from the two centre backs
Amazing
3 2 4 1. Coady dier rice (cb) Henderson Trent (cm) rashford Grealish phoden Sterling with kane striker
Both Henderson's should be starting, also Kalvin Phillips and Reece James. Stop trying to fit mount in when he's not that good, also Maddison is better.
so much attacking talent and he'll still play 7 defenders
Why did they leave out Henderson ?
Chuck norris has a picture of big roy on his bedside cabinet
Praise from Keano, to a Blue as well. Something you may never see again 🤣
This video: Foden's good. Now let's look at formations where he doesn't play.
I hope the Grealish mania ends now. All the England fans screaming for Grealish showing that they don’t understand football. You can’t just run around dribbling and have no end product hardly and he can’t play to a system and needs the team to be based around him but he’s not good enough for that. We got some good players though but I think Eric dier is a waste of a man on the pitch. And if Greenwood gets back to playing you would have to have him and Foden playing
that flick and run on the by-line was sick.
Was the game shown on ITV? Or do they just get together haha
that 4231 looks amazing.
Roy gets up early every morning to wake his alarm clock up
Rice over Henderson 😂
why did denmark finish above us when we had better goal difference?
