Salute to this great person, for his contribution towards society 🙏
Two aluminum sheets of 2 x 1 meters, which are hinged in the middle, can be placed around the deceased person to reduce the consumption of wood, reduce smoke, and protect from wind and rain, and they can also be used several times. They are Kurdish and style. Or he placed a metal cube on the deceased and performed the ceremony with the least amount of wood. The income of saving wood also goes to the workers. And the air is less polluted.
Respect 🙏🙏🙏

As a Hindu I am most disturbed watching open cremations in India.  Despite the religious undertone, it is the most grotesque episode, considering the progress India has made.  Why is there no change?  Death and departure should be a very solemn, private, spiritual moment.  In India, it has turned into a facade of vested interests prying on helpless loved ones and despicable at every step.  Please see how well and dignified this procedure takes place in Western societies.  Here are some thoughts.  Build small but spacious temple/crematoriums along Ganga equipped with Western technologies which will use electric or gas furnaces.  Space and facility should be provided at these temples for preparation of the dead bodies before cremation.  The temple arcade should be adorned with deities,  and facilities provided for families to rest and pray while the cremation takes place.  For those interested in business aspects, there is multibillion dollar industry waiting for investors.  More than ten million people die in India every year.    Time to progress.
India don't burn dead body not allowed
Govt busy creating laws to disturb it's own citizens. Still i should say Mera bharath mahan,  I hope I could have died in the covid along with my aged parents, instead of living in this meaningless democracy
Burning virus-infected bodies in the open air tends to vapourise or aerosolize the virus and make it airborne. This can raise the opportunity for others in the local vicinity to become infected by breathing it in and who then can spread it to others even further away if they are travelling by car, bus, train or plane. The huge numbers of Covid infected bodies being burned on this one spot probably make it an epicentre for spreading the virus in an airbourne form.
hamare keliye kuchh bhi nahi naseeb zero . phir se same zero luck
I hate Delhi covid did a good job with these people.well-done china we indians deserve this
The CCP will soon pay

You do you believe that all this dead coast by Covid  if you ask my answer is not coz some of this dead people are old they have a different illness and some doctors are lied
I dont believe on this
Indian culture is going to claim millions of lives , people in India should review their cultures with coronavirus out of control there , river is contaminated with coronavirus it is the apocalypse in india
Sir this pandemic was well planned by big shots all overe world including india. They wanted to eliminate the poor and middle class people and rule the world. God sees the truth but waits. Truth will unfold itself very soon. We can pray for the peace of the departed souls and then hunt for the culprits and ask them what did they gain by doing all this?  Any sane person will not blame China alone  or communism for this genocide/massacre.
Salute to this great selfless gentleman and  God bless on earth 🌍
Accept Jesus Christ 🙏
Hats off to you sir and very appreciate to ur hardwork & strength  towards care for strange unknown people helps.. may god give you lot's of courage and strength for further help.thank you sir !!

Massive respect.
Waheguru ji 😭😭🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Indian rituals of last rites are very personal to Indian families who lost their loved ones...by showing such content..western media has shown their double standards of reporting...the way nytimes reported death toll of 500,000 was simply scatter plot representation and they refrained from showing dead bodies being cremated.
Sir ... People like u r real people... U r helping people when there own people stayed away from themselves...  Thank you.. for everything.. respect u for everything...
This really shows the impact of this horrible virus.  GOD bless the people who do all they can to properly care for the dead. I pray an end of the virus.
You have a good heart ❤❤❤🇿🇦🇿🇦

This is the so-called "democracy" in the Indian population. Those in power in India can collectively step down and apologize. We do not need such "democracy". Very lucky to be born in China!
2020 and 2021 are special years for the devil, leaders sacrificing human lives for wealth sickening🤮
I have carried 45000 bodies - yeah right :)
May Allah bless India
This covid pandemic is clearly caused by human hands, the people who make the heavens can't see it through the eyes of the gods, so it leaked out to the whole world. People who see that North Korea is not infected will understand, if it is due to nature, the country of North Korea and South Korea sharing the same star island will be affected, and North Korea is not infected because North Korea is closed, so this virus caused by humans, this type of people who cause this epidemic is definitely inferior to animals, because animals are beasts but have never eaten their own kind, the 21st century where civilized humans live, the world should unite and destroy this kind of animal losers. Letting it exist would be disastrous for the civilized human world. If we don't kill this kind of person, the world will suffer the same doomsday fate with it.

Let this be a lesson learn to Indians all over the world. Why can't you be hygienic? Will you die from being hygienic and protective? The problem is the culture of India, the mindset and their attitude.
It's not around 3000 even.
May God Bless Jitender and his family, he teach us the value of humanity that maybe decrease in this hard situation
Thanks for real journalism as govt and India's mainstream media are very corrupt, still trying to divert people's attention by making them fight amongst on a religious basis.
Of all funeral rites.The Islamic way of being more environmentally friendly seems like the best way to adopt it.

And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: (Acts 17:30) Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God. (James 4:4) Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. (Matthew 7:13-14)
Imagine seeing your loved one burned I'm fell so sorry for India

It’s heartbreaking to see bodies being burned/buried like stray dogs. You’re so brave because you can even handle this devastating tragedy. Please if you can read this comment, don’t forget to take care of yourself.

Genuine repentance and recitation of those words will protect you from coronavirus:  "Falun Dafa is Good" and "Truth, Compassion, Forbearance is Good".    Falun Dafa (or Falun Gong) is a spiritual cultivation practice for mind and  body that is widely spreading in the world, it is based on the  principles of the Universe:   真 Truthfulness 善 Compassion 忍 Forbearance   It includes gentle exercises and meditation. It helped millions of people  to regain health, peace of mind and obtain spiritual fulfilment. Since  1999 this peaceful practice has been brutally persecuted by the CCP in  Mainland China. More than 100 million people around the world practice Falun  Gong.

SAYA ORANG INDONESIA CALAAA CALEEE CALEE
I am from India and Indian government done good to handle this virus, but because of large population and less medical facilities this problem occur first think India's population more than 1.3 billion 2 nd in world, so if you not help us than we request not spread fake news against india. Jai Hind. India is great 🙏🙏🙏🙏  Don't distribute fake news against india, India is population is very large because of that .01-.02% death may not be large, total fake news you spread, more then this killed by isis in Syria, please don't spread fake news against India, India is a 1.2 billion people country so if 200k died then it is not big. Our hospital are good and doctors work very hard but because of large population this problem occurs. Other wise India handle this vuhan virus very accurately.
Scary as hell 😭😭😭
Western media is enjoying over India negativity ,     There is no coverage of USA cemetery even they have more number of death .
My Lord please heal the world.. Help India country.. So pity them.. The power is in your hand my Lord.  😭😭😭

I pray for you India

Waste of wood and polute air
My full respects to this man and his organisation.
he has the balls of STEEL
Too difficult to watch.
Indians victims families need definite supports to fight Trauma, PTSD , and Melancholic depression in the near future.  WHO & WPA  should give indians any supports to confront these worse situations as soon as possible.  Pray for Indians From Cambodia  💗💗🙏🙏🙏💗💗

Poora desh rehne layak ni chora fenku ne.. tumko kewal dilli ki padi hai.. aur jagh b dhyan dete to aaj ye haal na hota
This is a tragedy brought about by the incompetence of leaders.
Inhuman modi is sitting ideal seeing more deaths....

So true .
This actually broke my heart ❤
Too disgusting u burn the bodies in an open area too dirty not good for healt omg duhhhh
Be healthy keep strong. I suggest to ask Wuhan for crematorium machine..🙏
This is for the covid deniers who likens it to the ordinary flu.
In India, there are many super rich people, but they are unwilling to donate to help the poor, these rich people are very selfish.
So true.... Log itne mar rahe h or flight me travel kro to aj tak bhi on board food serve kar rahe h , ek seat chod kr nahi beitha rahe. ... kyuki flight companies ko paisa banana h. Log mask or shield utarkr khana kha rahe h. Aise hi log pagal ho gye h or companies to hamara bewakoof bana hi rahi h. But in waja se log Or infect ho rahe h. Plz
Omg! This is so horrible to see. I have not seen this king of scene in my life.
My 82 year grandfather recovered of covid in home isolation. His oxygen level never fell below 94 and he had fever few times I thank God that we all recovered without any serious symptoms 🙏🙏
This happened when your government sucks ! When political rallies are more important than lockdown at home during second wave !
why didn’t you post a charity link in the description for those who want to donate??
Thankyou sir for all of this😭🙏
and he is not wearing mask
Oh God heal your people😢😢
Can any1 please tell me what pm modi ji is doing???
This man and other sikhs are doing what govt should have done, such shameless regime Modi has been creating, people are dying and he doesn’t care
Good
In this cruel world this man made us belive Humanity is still Alive.Thank you Sir 👍
This man is such an angel for his work. This video was so heartbreaking - it reminds me how privileged I am that I live in Australia and Covid in my state was only a 2-month mini lockdown with 9 deaths total. I can't imagine the pain that India is going through. May God help those suffering 🙏🙏
Isso é plano da maçonaria

ऐसे लोगों की भावना हर लाश के साथ अपनी वीडियो बना बना कर डालते हैं क्यों बिना लालच के कोई कुछ भी नहीं करता आने वाले इलेक्शन में बीजेपी से टिकट लेना है इन्हें और केजरीवाल के खिलाफ मुद्दों को बना रहे हैं यह दिल्ली सरकार को बदनाम करने की तैयारी है यह

Lord Jesus Christ is coming very soon. Repent, believe and be saved in the name of Lord Jesus Christ.
The Government was warned about the Second wave. All the POLITICIANS  were busy in Elections. They gave importance to ELECTIONS than PEOPLES  LIFE.
Face it. This is all India's fault for not following health regulations and sided with festivities and political rallies.
He is a warrior helping out people, think of spending a whole day in crematorium,  God save us all
India has the worst government system in the world and Indian public is finally raising their voice against the corrupt government
And thankfully he is wearing PPE.
What a bs. India is a nation of 1,4 billion ppl. If only 1% of them dies in a year (of all causes), thats 14 M in a year, or 40K every  single day. So the 200K dieing not because of but tested positive with covid is 5 normal days of death toll in India during the 15 months of pandemic. Same bs. as it was with the NY mass graves and Bergamo truckloads.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Here from trinidad words cannot describe how i am feeling about this situation😭😭😭😭😭
Pray to India...

:'(😪😪😪...i think stop cremating for sometine will make less CO2 in air.better clear air to breath...i know the religious factor but when it comes to life of living ppl everyonr should understand
So suddenly he realised that there is no respect for human life in India? Has he been living under a rock?
Say sorry to Kashmir they also died for nothing just because of u and your idiot President u are still not saying anything about kashmir so bear
I pray that God should protect this humble soul
Ya Allah mere Desh ke logon par rahem karna 🤲

First Kashmir, now Bengal Mark my word Hindus are running from their home.  We Hindus are destroying ourselves. Now Laalantop, The Quint, The wire all these communist forces are relentlessly reporting about their target is Yogi and then Modi.. Wake up Hindus no one save you except yourself.  Keep your self-interest aside and think for your own existence. I am well educated with all my senses I am saying this. They are very clear in their mind.. they vote for their parties irrespective of corruption price rise anything. it's only we have to decide and vote for our own existence. I myself have witnessed their game in Bengal its very nasty we will be on the roads friends.. wake up now Vote only for BJP. Ye channel sab bika hua he doston. Dont fall in their trap. Govt. is trying day and night to restore normalcy.

Jatinder deserve Nobel prize , he honoured the dead and worked so hard even  by putting his and family life at risk .
This is the consequence of poor planning and mismanagement.
Wish all Indiana recover rapidly. We love all of you and we always support to you and family. Big love ❤️

Prayers for everyone in the whole world that’s going through this Covid times.  This man did the right thing which  should not be any cost of a grave yard sites , nor a caskets or anything when The Whole word is turning up side down . Bless his heart and soul and also all the front line people as well. Maybe god watch over everyone 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
His count of total cremations and funerals is for 25 years as the scrolled news on screen shows. The surge in huge number of cases and deaths in India came later than America and Brazil , and huge numbers of cases likely started in March 2021 in more industrialized states and bigger cities. Immigrants tell me the surge in cases and big numbers in India started in about March 2021 (this year) or surge in cases may have started even last month (April 2021), for lesser known Indian states with less cases. Now, immigrants in America say Indian backward states in the middle of nowhere are having a surge in cases even is the surge is small. They say surge in cases just started if those remote places in India had few locals who travel to bigger cities or have relatively no interaction with multinational companies or with countries like mainland china and the other countries.
Great work sir 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This is the great plague all over again
Thank You so much .. tum bahut accha kaam karta hai jitendar bhai

They're unhygienic habit makes covid case worst. That's why people commenting its ok to be unhygienic, look at this situation in india you can see how deadly it could be...
This is china's fault,
When there is a problem, there are always sardarjis first to come up to help. India owes a lot to Sikh community. We shouldn't treat them how govt and others have treated them.
History says SIKHS are always there for  help , serving sleeplessly . May God save lives 🙏
Corona is not spreading by itself ; it needs a human to spread from one person to another person. Sad truth is 90% Indian publics never follow any rules. All these days they wore the face mask beneath their mouth just for the rules / name sake..  After witnessing so many deaths now they  started wearing "double masks"..    "even if the virus is mild, India like populated countries will pay a huge price".. Last year when WHO declared corona as a pandemic , they said the same statement; 1st wave we escaped and unfortunately 2nd wave teqching us a lesson.   Even now publics are not  taking enough  precautions . News Media sending the reporters inside a corona ICU for taking interviews.  If there is a gap of 1/10,000 times of your hair thickness, corona can enter.  Eg. If a hair stuck in between your mask , u get a chance for infection.  A virus can infect u through ur eyes.  ICU is a high viral load area , one time face shields are not a safe...  Be responsible! , dont waste N95 masks and PPEs unnecessarily!    Instead of panicking the public  kindly educate the publics  , create some awareness to people. Facemasks are to reduce aerosal coming out from ur nose and mouth. mask cannot protect u from virus, surgical masks are just a precaution,  N95 masks are for frontline workers. THOSE WHO WERE EXPOSED TO RIAKY AREAS MUST ISOLATETHEMSELF FROM OTHERS, BUT THEY WILL NOT DO THAT!   What is left to contain the spread is  DONT GO OUTSIDE UNNECESSARILY! , frequently wash ur hands with soap, Keep 3 meter SOCIAL DISTANCING etc..  Put a LOCKDOWN to reduce the spread!

God have mercy 🙏🤣 but this is too much
Salute to the selfless humanitarian service espoused by this gentleman and his team. Humanity should prevail in all respects.
Jitender sir, you are a real gem🙏
You mentioned that the whole crematorium is funded on donations. Insider, it would be great if you mention any/all donation links we can help them through.
God bless you indai
Great job is done by jiterendra and his warrior.may God bless india
I live in delhi. I cry everyday. My knowns have died. One family only has a father and a son remaining, other than that every one has died
Even a Nobel prize has no value against Jitendar Singh.
Who cares
In workers bicharon ne itni zyada aag or heat ke beech me khud ko itna zyada covoer bhi kiya hua he pta nhi kese itni garmi bardasht kr rahe hen ye log. In sb kam krne walon ki azmat ko salam.
Societal believes doesn’t works at this hr n this situation shows that watever religion we r .. it’s meant to support eachother n here in this videos we can see various religion cremating the bodies with the help of each other..at the end everyone is the children of one god though we believe in different ways
May Waheguru keep you safe Jatinder Ji!!!
In 100 years time this mans name, Jitender Ji    will be a name people will remember,  in Indias darkness hour he put duty and humanity above everything else. To watch 1000s of lives end this way is the true reality of Covid.   Love to India.
kashmiriyoo py jo zulum kiyaa choty choty bachy ko be gunhaa shaheed kiyaa. bary jawan logo ko shaheed kiya. tw ALLAH pak tw dikhaye gaa naww unky khoon ka badlaa ALLAH pak dera.. tw khudaa ka khoof karo be gunhaa logo ko mt maroo India walo..
The crematoriums make it really dramatic and very sad. Although it doesn’t look like this where I live, the death toll is even worse. People seem to be complacent because they don’t see a scene like this here... I hope this is a wake up call. It’s not over yet.
Oh MUSLIMS !!!  PAY ATTENTION  Narrated `Aisha: Whenever Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) became sick, he would recite Mu'awwidhat (Surat Al-Falaq and Surat An- Nas) and then blow his breath over his body. When he became seriously ill, I used to recite (these two Suras) and rub his hands over his body hoping for its blessings. Sahih al-Bukhari 5016
Ya allah..

Omg, Lord have mercy 🙏🙏🙏
After seeing what the world went through all of last year, did they think they were immune? They were cricket matches that were packed with thousands and thousands of people the political rallies going on and concerts only 4 weeks ago. How could one country not learn the lessons of a million dead people
RIP
Very sad yes but people die, it wasn't covid they died from because we all die, make sure u know Christ as Savior & have discernment and don't believe fake disinformation videos.
Total absolutely bs
Respect paa ji 🙏🙏
Respect 🙏 We will rise again 🇮🇳

Salute to you Jitender Ji
I think i give you a minister job you will do better than others.
and i can't believe there's karens refusing to wear masks while this is happening.
More than everything I pray for his mental health.
Thank you Jitender sir 🙏🙏 Respect from Heart 😢😔😭
What a shame! At least respect the dead. Did media show any dead bodies' last rites in the US, UK, or Germany? what should we call it - racism even for the dead? There are till date more dead in the US than India. More per 1000 dead in the UK and Germany. Show me ONE picture from these countries. You cannot and you should not.  But for 'some' reason you can show that in India/Brazil? Why?  How can you be so insensitive? Media is thinking about TRP even now? What's wrong with you guys?  Do you remember the vulture photo near a malnourished kid which was taken in Africa? This is what the standard of today's media filled with closet hatred for any nation which is not from developed nations. You guys are vultures.
As we all knew, death can never come back, so this tragedy has left relatives, parents and grandparents separated forever, and only grief eats the whole country.

Thank you sardar ji❤️
please india please, your begging the world for help without first helping yourselves, show the world that with aid, you will put into practice the same preventative measures to curb the transfer of covid19, the whole worlds government's has it's crosses to bear, but with breakthroughs  in science we at least know that if you continue to allow the gatherings, no matter how much aid is given, without good practice, nothing can be done to reverse your situation any time soon
Proud to serve the nation
God bless him
Recycle the same cremation site!
Stop throwing human remains in the ganges......they'll be throwing all these in the already polluted  river ...Indian mentality is the reason why they suffer
Can we possibly have phone no of Jatinder ji in india. We would like to help him

If you are reading this, stay strong and keep safe. My deepest condolences to everyone affected by these events. I wish everyone peace and hope. During these turbulent times there is still hope in the middle of the fear. There are good news, God promises to be with you because he loves you. "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life" John 3:16.  I just want to let everyone know that Jesus loves you with a passion more than you can imagine. He gave his life so you can be free. Give your cares to him, for he cares for you  If you've got pain He's a pain taker If you feel lost He's a waymaker If you need freedom or saving  He's a prison shaking savior  If you're got chains  He's a chain breaker.  Don't let your heart be troubled. I wish everyone the best day.

Doing great thing for humanity, Be safe
Hats off to this guys, he is not a god but much more than that. Sikh community is the only community which comes forward in extreme issues and problems. Other communities most of time never raise even 1 finger or go  beyond their comfort zone. Shame on India, Shame on modi government and shame on us who have not taken this pandemic seriously.
நன்றி. சிங் ஜி
Modi government failed

Very sad to see what is being displayed.

So Sad but India had too man  people  living one on top of another. Earth needs to breath is too many  if us .. Formales dont have a lot of chilldren
How do you donate to him?
Instead of allowing immigrants in the USA.  Vaccine needs to sent to India. How did the country get infected.  Bills Gates help these people not population control
this honestly just breaks my heart💔
Salute to you Jitendra ji
O no theres something bigger. Killing them people over there. Thats crazy they need. Jesus
That is bad idea becoz more people can smell s the smoke from cremation body
That cremation idea of india is not good idea
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
If this was in the US or UK, they wouldn't have shown the graphical images seen here for the sake of "respecting the dead". Western media will never change
God bless you sir....

Salute to you Sardaar ji and your team ,keep it up for the humanity 🙏
chose a PM an ignorant Tea seller now Dying and burning like Trash 😈☻🇮🇳💩💩🖕
I hope all the Indian politicians are watching this. And next time don’t come and ask for votes. They should get middle finger for the votes.
That Sikh man seem to be the one good person in all of this. Would definitely welcome him in Canada so he could escape this hell.
And orchestrated by your friendly mass murderers, Bill gates
Carbon footprint?
Hate you china wuhan
Very sad 😥😥 video
Don't Burnt Them Why you Burning them Oh God This is Hell Fire 🔥
We have a high recovery rate also..
Lol
الله يرحمهم
Looks hot.
Don’t worry India has large population .
"But we have the oath to not let people suffer because of the lack of wood. Not even if that costs selling our homes"  Sometimes heroes don't wear capes. They wear masks, have a shovel and need wood.
Do they know body feel pain  for the fair please font don't burn your people's body
Is there any link for donations to him? Thanks
I wonder how the people that are working at the crematorium keep track of who's body they are cremating, because it seems as if they are cremating many bodies at one time isn't it a chance that they may give the wrong ashes back to someone's family?
This man deserves a big salute & due respect. People like him all over India in these times as well.. Thank God for these people, the dead are cremated. If not, the situation would be something other that can't be described.. Oh God! Please have mercy on our people & heal our land. Please lord.
WHO HAVE ABUSED LIGHT ..SHALL KNOW IT NO MORE. U HAVE REAPED WHAT YOU SOWED... AND THE WICKED  SHALL PUNISH THEMSELVES.. FOR U JUDGE YOURSELVES...ALL YOUR DILUSIONS AGAINST MY CHILDREN SHALL BE YOUR DESTRUCTION... YOU SHALL EXIST IN NOTHINGNESS FOR A TIME TIME AND HALF A TIMES..AND THEN U SHALL BECOME WHAT YOU OPRESSED... AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE NO  MERCY  FOR U SHOWED NO MERCY..AND I SHALL TURN MY BACK TO YOU AND HEAR NAUGHT  FOR WHEN YOUR CHILDREN RAVAGED MINE...U HEARD NOT AND DID NOT...AN EYE FOR AN EYE AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH..SO SAYITH CHRIST JESUS..HIS WILL BE DONE
I'm not writing this comment but pouring my best wishes. I'm broken from inside out. I'm known to write the harshest of words. Forgive me.
Did they ever stop to think about all of those ashes getting dumped into the river.. how badly they are contaminating it??
People should learn humanity from him
Our Salute to this great man. Our Sincere prayers in the feet of Lord Hari to give him strength and protect him.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
lot of wood burn and lot of poluation  the indian people can plant a tree avery year

Very distrubing visuals and pure example for failure of government and people should think before they choose the leader for this nation who going to rule us ...
In order to make profits in the stock market/Bitcoin investment one has to have a good strategy and proper knowledge of how the holders manipulate the market.

Am not saying am finding people dying good but the indian population is overpopulated so people dying is causing it to be normal  But my prayers to families who lost a precious member 🙏
Seeing some hateful Hindu's in the comments here 🙆‍♀️
The world’s most illiterate & incompetent man was elected to be India’s PM. That led to the catastrophe..!!!
That guy is a good man.
Great Help
Such a stupied thing burning dead bodies like this😏
Still in the next election we the people forget all these sufferings and smile and shake hands with those traitors who abandoned us.
Hats off u bro..God bless u..
India should stop burning their Dead person u need clean environment this unclean environment is more dangerous than corona
Stop burning your dead... Indians you are making the condition even worse... people are dying because of no oxygen...  and burning lots of dead bodies make the environment even more unhealthy for the corona patients, they will suffer more .
Government kya kar rahi hai,jub sab kuch aam aadmi ko hi karna hai to ......

Propaganda
Over population is the root cause of all problems...

That last part.....  humanity is dying  How can you trust humanity if there is no oxygen
He correctly said..IN DELHI HUMANITY IS DEAD...  Times has come that we should talk about population control as our infrastructure is over burden by this...
Uncle allah apko sahi salamat rakhe

Money money moneeeey!
Thank you sir 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I am seen this person everywhere
hm
If there's one thing i learnt during this crisis, its that punjabis have a heart of gold
This is all because of bjp government. The patients could be saved if there would have been adequate supply of oxygen.......
Only Hindus are dying
God bless u, we may have different religion, but you have a good soul, i hope the whole world will find the healing very soon, no more sickness or death, but people need to work together, and give back to nature.
Modi is responsible

My heart feel so heavy watching all this... Isn't this stuff shows clearly how we need to change our leader???  Oh my Indian fellow... Grow up and chose your leader wisely
Sikhs are so kind this is awful.
People like these literally deserve a Nobel prize. Salute to you sardaar ji! indeed!
And recently hundreds and possibly thousands of respirators were thrown in landfills in America.
I thought children had a better recovery rate then adults ? Somebody lied to us?
As a Chinese, my heart is with Indian people at this moment. Their political system cannot save their lives when pandemic comes, even dead are in queque to casual pyres. They do need have a change for better lives. Bless innocent people
india is doing  deforestation now?

We pray for Indian..! It's really faster than others country. RIP for them🙏

🙏
I can not imagine the smell of all those corpses burning
Hats off to Shunty ji...u r doing wht everyone cant
"It's not just humans that are dying, its humanity too"

I hope Jitender Ji recover from Covid . It’s sad that people like him risking their lives for others . Salute you sir
😷😷😷😷😭😭😭😭🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🙏🙏🙏🇮🇳🇮🇳🙏😭😭😭😷😷😷😷😷
The media should be ashamed how they shoot and take pics of dead corpses  THEY COULD NOT LIVE WITH PEACE, PLS LET THEM DIE WITH PEACE
At this rate of deaths, is there any need to cremate them ? Better bury in mass graves. Sometimes we need to leave traditions behind ans and use common sense
An amazing, humble, hard working man.
“if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.” ‭‭2 Chronicles‬ ‭7:14‬ ‭
In begning  Sikh were supposed to be the cream group of intlectuls . Later at the time of shri guru govind singh Maharaj  Sikhs were supposed to be a group of top brave warriors of great decipline and dedications ...these groups became the followers of Sikhism. Gunanak dev  the founder of Shiism and ,Gurugovind singh  are  also like God or DEVTA for Hindus likes so many others gods  in India..
Waheguru bless you all
"But when this is fated to happen, it will happen." -Legendary, Jutander Ji
Truly heartbreaking.
Help is on the way! The vaccine are coming but slow, it still coming.
Sikhs are the best kinds of humans.
This is exactly why we wear a mask, socially distance and don't attend crowded places, only thanks to this measurements we did not end up like India. Show that to your pandemic deniers and pray for India
Burning human bodies will make big problems Because of climate changes And many people will die of pollution  It is better burry them until the control the situation
Instead donating money to govt send money to people like him
yaa alloh😭😭😭😭semoga india lekas membaik....amiinnnnn
"If u need any help ask the one whose wearing a turban they will help without question" a statement from a bystander when I my car battery died at carpark shopping centre thus needed another car for recharge and my baby was crying inside. I asked people passing by but they refused. So i approached person with turban. They helped me. Happened in Sydney Australia
THANK YOU JI ,NO WORDS SORRY.
😓😓
Link to donate to them would be helpful....
Pray for Modi - Modi will save the world
May God watch and bless him.
My god this is soul crushing 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
guru nanak आपको इंसानियत की सेवा करने की  ताकत व त॔दरुसती बकशिश करे हमें सिख होने का गर्व है भलेही लोग हमे आतंकवादी कहै फिर भी हम इंसान का दर्द समझते है।
Just remember every one, it's not haterd, fueled by politician's, with terms like kalistan, kashmir which is saving india now, but the pure love and humanity which is there within us. Do not let any politician or group allow this wonderful love we have for one another be destroyed by greedy politician's...
I'm so sad to hear about what's going on there.
We should Thank to God every time...that we get air to breath for free...many ppl are struggling to pay for cylinder to take a breath...May God protect us all.....
Jitendra ji, your selfless service making me cry from inside
God bless you Sir 🙏
All because of Pradhan Mantri Modi
All BULLSHIT LIES
They died because of the pandemia. Simple. Add the festival, people getting into the river Ganges in droves, no sanitary measures, no masks, no distance, etc. People said nothing would happen to them because the godess Kali would protect them. Perhaps they were mistaken. At least burning the bodies is more sanitary than throwing them into the river
Feel so sad for these people 😢😢😞😞
Modiji murdabat.. He is bg in election
China will pay for using bio weapons ✊✊

My heart goes out to all the families in India right now. Do hope things will get better there soon.

Crazy, open air cremation. Do it here in the states, they charge you an arm and a leg. California very greedy and not compassionate
Sardar ji your a real legend our duas are with you all
4:03 ignorance kills ... Wearing socks, gloves, dude, you should be wearing two layer of cloths and fully cover the nose if you don't have masks. Sanitizing surfaces isn't effective, avoiding droplets  contact avoid getting the virus. India needs scientific information. Journals and news in India should start commenting on these issues. Health agents are victims of incompetence and misinformed governments that distribute medicine with no efficacy.
From 🇨🇳 to 🇺🇲 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🇮🇹 🇵🇰 🇲🇫 and now🇮🇳 > 😷 🦇
It is tradition in my family to be cremated. I took my father’s ashes to Ireland and my daughter took my mother’s ashes to Ireland. I want my ashes to be put into the Delaware River or in the ocean nearby. The American legion post near us will take the ashes out to sea for legion members. My friend had his son buried at sea. It is the best way. We still have viewings and church services done before cremation.
Greta... better not be mad at this.
Thank you to this man for everything he is doing 🙏🏽
Corona doesnt filter based on religion but news/media in the west always do biased reporting against one particular religion.
Hopefully this will stop spam calls.
❤ 🌹
This is something out of a horror movie only worse because it is real.
Thank you Sir, hamare beech aaj bhi Insaniyat ko Zinda rakhne k liye 🙏
I hope future generations rise to the task of fixing this messed messed up world we live in
whos laughing at China now?
And blind Bhakhts call them Khalistani or with different names.  Hats off.
Looks like the end of the world
God Bless India
hell on earth, truely incredible india
How can I donate to Jitender's organization online? I do not live in India and do not have an Indian bank account.
God bless this man
When someone dies they already feel so much pain on top of this you burn them in fire, imagine the level of pain the body would feel.   Only hindus/indians believe in this burning phenomenon and there are 194 odd countries around the world nobody else does this. If they do, it will be indian hindus who migrated to other countries continue to follow this ritual. Its high time hindus should analyze and assess their religion.
Salute to the selfless humanitarian service espoused by this gentleman and his team. Humanity should prevail in all respects.
Modi Modi Modi Modi  Modi Modi Modi wah Modi ji wah!
Wanna know da dark truth bout India it costs 10 to 15k dollars to be able to burn a body now dats one thing no other nation does apart from India. Blame the people out there in India they wanna make a livin of somebody’s death 💀
Sat Sri Akal Jitenderji. Wahae Guruji be with you.
Prayers from America.🇺🇸... Hang in there India, you are in our thoughts and prayers. Help may be slow, but it’s coming.
Yeah thanks for contributing to Co2 emissions
Greta Is not pleased

Soo sad😪
Bs propaganda.
I don't want to be rude but why burn bodies, why not bury them at sea it wont cause global warming
Please submit the one creator .after that you don't need to cremate your body we have to respect the body if is life or dead .
All the remaining oxygen will be consumed  by cremation plz burry them
🙏
It’s god saying our population is too big
China should help
It takes days to burn a body like that!!
Please make this video a fundraiser so that we can raise funds to help people in India
He should get a Nobel prize for his humanity
China is sending the New Deadly Viras-19 to India.. Its time for all the World to awake - Up.. Nuke CHINA ASAP
Please get some IVERMECTIN!!!!
Good man
Who are the idiots on here who have posted 487 thumbs down so far ? Why don’t you get off your backside and serve the community as this Sikh man is doing  ?
When the going gets tough, the tough gets going. I salute you.
the manipulation of media makes it look like it's everywhere on the streets,but they're lots... May these souls find peace 🙏🏻
Popilation is high there & poverty too  God mercy

Bless his heart...
Fake. News

I cant imagine the smell my gosh
Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior.
Northern California have a large Sikh population. All wonderful people.
Sikh are amazing people,
Sorry for any one who lost loved one. How ever this country is riddled with corruption and general devalues the life of the poor, sick, mentally ill and low cast   this story need independent investigation. Poverty has been killing many in this country prior to cov. What's really changed? We need  more thorough research.
They are dying because of malnutrition not covid any virus will wipe you out without essential vitamins and minerals. Burning bodies is custom in their culture not because of the plandemic.
Rip
Our prayers and condolences with everyone affected 🙏🙏🙏🙏
RIp to all those who lost their life
He should wear screen  and protect himself  too. 😢🙏🏼
where can I donate?
This guy is gift from God himself. I just prayed for 10 straight minutes to protect him and to help him stay strong mentally
I may live in America but, I pray for u and my moms family to be safe
This are the type of people that deserve a Nobel Prize Award. People who actually understand the value of human life, God help us all. Please Pray for India!
Have no fear brother. Increase your faith. Believe in God trust as I pray for you and India population and that people be more humane towards one another, be it color,creed or race. God is in control and I also pray you lack nothing for your cremations. Good speed as God will be done ✅ Amen.

Just watching this video makes me cry
That guy is awesome.  What a service he is doing.
I feel sorry but what did you expect  after having thousands at religious festivals all over India
CANCER and infection (corona) TREATMENT: - Local mediators in the cell core A- primary mediators: - Histamine, proteases-kinase, tryptase-and chemotactic factors-ecf <eosinophil and NCF neutrophil chemotactic factor B-PAF (platelet activating factor) and arachidonic acid system products (such as exanoids, prostglandins and thromboxaneA2) are the best examples. B-sequencing mediators In inflammatory cells, peptide cytokines (interlokines) produced over the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi after exposure to the antigen are also regarded as interferons as sequencing mediators. All of these in the nuclei of blood cells If we cut these nuclei and injected their fluids into the blood. If we do, all blood cells become a single function (cleanser). If we load Rh, the systemic mediators also come and the cancer cells disappear (work in rabbits) The dose is one drop   Getting rid of obesity, obesity caused ??? diseases can also be completely cured Testosterone + Rh >> kc = Gluconeogenesis (chlorine delivery) this method is more suitable   YOUR (LUCKING) TREATMENT?: - {Testosterone + Rh infusion into the hypothalamus} + {Ayaka maximum dos (CSF) infusion} > After 40 days the body will have a body like 13 years old and can give birth ...

Wahu guru gi ka kalsa whu guru gi ki fathey
Modi was so excited about doing political rallies in Bengal, ignoring his country, his people n covid-19. The virus didn't ignore India, the results of the election is now out in front of everybody, hopefully covid-19 doesn't stay away from modi for long. I guess that's the karma. Modi failed Indians, his duty as pm, as a leader of that country so losing was certain. Wish u greater defeat for the future modi.
Hygien and dirty water , there are two major problem .Indian goverment do not stop situation ,if did change mentality .
Respect to this man, God bless
I do understand how you feel and also know that the dying people will be in heaven YES! they will be in heaven to really restart another life that will be much better. We are very OLD SOUL and we understand when we die. The saddest is ours just ours to fell. GOG /Goddess bless you all.......

So sad 😞
3:29 No, you are not disturbed. You're tired. Also you accepted the fact that its not Covid or death of women & children, its sustainability that isn't there.  Disturbed is when you don't want nothing to do with it regardless if you are getting paid.
But christian missionaries and islamic jihadis need more land
you are great jitinder pa g

Im crying just watching what is happening in India, thank you for what you do Jatinder. To our brothers and sisters in India, better days are coming, hang jn there 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
prayers for india this breaks my heart
He’s truly a hero. There isn’t enough thank you’s that can be said to you, Jitender Ji  for what you are doing 🙏🏻
You have done sin , killed innocent people of Kashmir , Delhi and many other regions of India it's time to ay back . Allah caught you soon for your sins
Why they are burning people on wood why they font burn them in a furnace
Sad wat the world has experienced... I admire this guy and people who work w him
And yet everything comes from china even the spoon you use to eat your breakfast  How's about stop feeding the commies and start fighting back. You all might be scared but if we don't start something we will always be in fear. Stop running start fighting
Ye Allah ka Azab hy in logon per jo inhon nai muslmano ki saath kia abb inki Katni ka waqt hy.
In this day and age, why do people have to die from being denied their fundamental right  to life and health? Mr. Jitender Singh's statement at the end is so true. No value for human life in the capital city of India. how can you trust these people and system? Why? Why?  How do I  donate to Mr. Singh's organization?
Is there anywhere you can donate? I do not have much at the moment as I do not work due to chronic illness but I can donate what I have. I am blessed to have made a full recovery from COVID even though I had seriously breathing problems. This whole pandemic is heartbreaking. Take care of each other ❤️
So many people could've been saved if China didn't create the virus and if India would stop prioritizing imaginary friends and excessive breeding.
Sardar g Khuda apki hifazat kre.
"It's not just people who are dying in Delhi, it's humanity that is dying, too" 😭
Salute to jitenderji. I was an intern under a sardarji in chandni chowk. He was so good to me. Went with him so many times to the chandni chowk gurudwara.
Oh Lord our God please comfort their families🤧😭😰 call our God to forgive our sin. This is really heartbroken💔💔💯😢
Overpopulation. Nature abides.
The smell of burning human flesh is atrocious!
Whaguru mahar kari 🙏🙏🙏
Bhgwan apko bhut himmat de ....
Such a great men Jitender ji I solut
Jitender and his team needs a national award. 👍
Hats off to you
CHRIST
😮
Hatsoff to you sir…
Singh is king
.                           .                        .             .
THIS IS SO SAD lets all not forget to thank CHINA for this grief
I got covid19 I can't breathe too one solution that I did if you don't have oxygen in the hospital.go to open area inhale Exhale outside then take Allergies medication then nasal spray then cough syrup to survive, because I'm watching the man in India he removed the breathing apparatus because it run out oxygen then he was starting getting natural air then don't panic so you breathing normally. But do it if their is  no people around so you can get oxygen in my experienced because I got covid19 preciously Good luck and God bless you.
So sad
how stupid are they in india they done this to them selfs it was the kumbh mel 3.4 million people gatherd that is the reason for this. and they are still gathering in there 100's so dont feal that sorry for them it is there own doing
Is there a link where we can help donate to the man whose helping burn the bodies for free?
my heart goes to the innocent Indians
Prophetic to say “We are watching humanity die” and why live in a city when you cannot be taken care of - what is happening right now is gonna change the future in ways we don’t even know yet,  hopefully for good and not for the loss of our freedoms
🙏🙏Plz dont leave your home until n unless it's necessary really heart broken video 😭😭🙏🙏
Props to this guy for helping coronavirus patients for 25 years straight!
Thanks to Jitendra Singh ji for great service of humanity. Where PM has no courage to speak now Jitendra ji  is continuously doing service for mankind. 🙏🙏🙏🙏
It is either this Lie. Or the U.S.A will call B52
Here from hong kong, I feel for your heart breaks due to the tremendous loss of your city. I respect you to deliver the services to the people even in desperate circumstances. I wish you and your family have good health and luck to get through this pandemic, hope this disaster could end soon
They are relying on donations but how do we donate?
Jitender ji, saadar naman aapko aur aapke sathiyon ko.
May Jesus living God protect you, I pray
Pretty incredible how all this wasn't already expected.. if anything all of Asia should have been strictly quarantined from the start, now the world is big trouble..
But yet here we are letting China go freely with no repercussions. There’s still wet markets going on, China lifted all COVID bans but the rest of the world suffers and cowards in fear.
I have a question, does anybody know if the burning corpses smell bad?
Nice dumping ppls ashes into the water ways
Pane Bože prosíme tě , usetři nás dalších smrtí a převelikého zármutku. Děkujeme ti a doufáme, že naše prosby vyslišíš. Otče nás jenž jsi na nebesích, posvěť se jméno Tvé, buď vůle tvá jako v nebi tak i na zemi, chléb náš vezdejší dej nám dnes a neuveď nás v pokušení, ale zbav nás od zlého. Ve jménu Otce i Syna  i Ducha svatého. Amen.
All I see is footage of a man who works at a crematorium doing his job with a fabricated sob story attached. Where are the millions of bodies that are supposedly piling up in the streets? Western media is trying to convince us that India currently resembles Europe during the Black Death (a real pandemic that didn't require 24/7 news coverage to keep the hysteria alive) yet the homemade footage that I've seen showed India in a serene state. Same as here in the UK. Media is telling us the world is ending, yet nobody knows anybody who's died of covid alone (co-morbidities don't count), and the only observable changes are the sanctions on our freedoms. They're playing us like fiddles. First, nobody with two brain cells to rub together bought the "bodies in the streets of China" narrative, so they shifted their attention to Brazil and the fabled "Brazilian strain" that Brazilians themselves denied existed, and now this nonsense. Even in this footage the effects of the "pandemic" look tame at best. Absolute joke.
The fact wearing a simple mask has been made into declaring a political stance in America is concerning. I hope we can lift the vaccine restrictions for India to have fair access. I hope we all wake up to caring about our neighbors.
I dont trust of Covid 19...its only a conspiration  🤣😃😃
I think hindus should start parting the dead buy incinerating it in those machines like how many are doing since they dont have an option to bury them, Burning wood is causing pollution on a large scale, especially in delhi,the pollution levels are very toxic there.I think that in the future they will have to stop burning wood because there will be very few forests left
Blame this Modi....Gujarat  Genocide mastermind.... 2002. He asked Hindus to kill Muslims.   ADV SANJAY PUNJABI hiranandani gardens powai Mumbai 400076
Anyone know how we can donate ?
Real hero!
He is a real hero... Respect sir
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Shame on media for this misery porn. People are/were dying in many countries, but they never showed the mass burial of the dead.  West media is doing their best to malign India's image.
Where's the so called government there They should be helping but probably not they are hiding in their homes letting him deal with what's going on WOW this world is fucked up!!!!!!!
Jitinter walking 😇
False propganda. Media releasing images of people involved in gas leak and saying its covid.
حمد لله على نعمة الاسلام ان ابتعدتم عن لله ازدتم بلاء
The poor people who are struggling to deal was this crisis.
this is so sad.....imagine if we had to face bringing one of our family to a parking lot to be burned bc there was no oxygen available for them, we are so lucky to be in Canada or the U.S. right now.
If all those who died took  Ivermectine 12 mg for 3 Days they could have been saved.
Breaks our heart watching this
❤🙏❤
terrible what BJP/Modi have done to India - God bless everyone in India
मोदी है तो मुमकिन है.............Stupid BJP focussing on elections only.........God save India !!!!!
I think we , (us) could do better , by shipping over tons, & tons of wooden pallets soon! it will bug the Mexicans for a short time, but they really need the wood!
I can only imagine what he's going through 😥😥😥 I had my mom cremated when she died of cancer,She was 53 she was gone just like the dust in the wind
Then tell me about climate change.
There is some video coming out of India claiming it's about Covid, but it actually looks like news from the gas leak back in 2020
China,Italy,UK,India
In Kaliyuga , cremating a body is equal to 100 ashwamedha yaga
Sikhs are good people with a big heart.
Paji, tussi ho sant.
I used to live in delhi for 7 years before moving to australia for my masters...and seeing all this that is happening to my country makes me feel so bad that i cnt imagine how painful it is for the people that i have seen over those years...he is saying it 100% right...humanity was on it edge of dying and now with this covid crises and black marketing of oxygen cylinders it has died.  Salute to you mr. Shunty for carrying out such hard and painful task in such times. God bless everyone!
Amen
Thx brother... you are truly have great heart!!!!!   Bill Gates and his Team destroyed this world with covid19, now he is control of the vaccination. I guess depopulation is working well for him. Too many bloods at his hand.
Hehehehehehehe next time agaien vote modi
I’ll wait for answers
Why did god give them covid
Sending many prayers for your country😢😢😢
This is so sad.. 😢 The world will never forget!  CHINA MUST PAY!!!!
This is so absolutely horrible! When will it end? 💔💔💔
I dont hate chinese ppl but your governments actions is too sketchy
May their soul Rest In Peace
Here corona is not an important issue, winning votes are important. We already know now what will the importance of humans be if this government continues to rule over india.
What an amazing man! ❤
Just my opinion===(1) may use blood thinners or un-clotting medications to unclot blood in lungs, (2) and use some steroid to counter virus effects. (3) immune system reaction to virus also making lung clotting--suppressing may control disease
China is working..
True Hero
So many unnecessary deaths
Is there any way to help? Even to help fund for wood??
Mass cremations and graves because of a rampant plague that has turned the whole planet on its head. Born 1984, Australia. I never would I thought that in my lifetime, that a crisis of this scale would happen. Madness.🙁
Jitenderjis karma is recipe for moksha. Hari om
Let's pray for Indian's people🙏🙏🙏
Modi likes space program more
Share the stats, testimony, share reactions! Show some respect for the dead and give the families some privacy!
A Big Respect to all frontliners!
They're acting like half of India has been killed when in reality it isn't even 1%
Im From Trinidad 🇹🇹,and i watch Jintindra Sir doing this  incredible thing,donating his time to  this for so so many families,i get emotional😢😢.. My heart goes out to india ..Bless you always and keep you safe Jintindra Sir🙏🏻🙏🏻
🙏🏼Jesus Christ Bless India . Stay strong India. We pray for your country. Amen 🙏🏻🇲🇨
Bhai aap safe se rahiye. Great person. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Mmmmm. Mainstream media news again.
Respect +++ 🙏🙏
An cnn using this video saying people dieng on the streets of covid
It doesn't matter how much footage you show of the Indian disasters.  Some people still deny its happening. Social media platforms are creating lies  That some actually believe  This is all a conspiracy theory. It's not your eyes do not lie
Jai sikh
I don't buy it, I call bullshit
Can someone enlighten me how a country w/ so many dying at such alarming rate, and on the other side of the country, they are having Elections ?
Over populated country that has more than 60% in poverty.  Conspiracy theorists say that this is a form of population control. The Indian Gov't knew about this variant months ago. . . . And did nothing. You have to ask yourself why. Less poverty = less Gov't assistance programs = corrupt politicians  become wealthier.  My heart goes out to the India.
How many trees did they cut down to cremate
I cannot believe there’s dislikes on the video...demons really live among us. Thank you Jitendra ji, I will donate as much as I can
check your borders..china gave that to you...rest in peace...God will protect the weak
Abey lvde men kya hotha he chote bachche women sub log ek hi he zada Karune math de
Really thanks bhai. You are doing a great job. God give you strength.
People like him give some hope to humanity. World needs to rethink.
I would like to donate to his NGO... Anyone knows details?
MODi and the health Minister should be charged for Murder of thousands of Indian citizens..!
You are an angel on earth jitendar sir. May God give you courage and keep healthy.
आरएसएस कहाँ है इतनी बड़ी आपदा में जो कहते थे की देश की सेवा करना उनका कर्त्तव्य है  हर इलेक्शन बूथ पैर ये आरएसएस वाले ये बोलते मिलजाते है की अगर कोन्ग्रेस्स को वोट दिया तो हिन्दू खतरे में आ जाएगा।   ये आरएसएस आज देश की पापुलेशन कम हो रही है उसमे हेल्प कर रहा है शायद
there's a saying that the worst fate is  if you dont even get cremated properly
Pahil bat mai ye k Sardar ji log dil k bare ache hote hai,  Dusra ye k inke dharam mai koi bhi banda bhik nahi mangta sarko pe   Tisra ye k koi bhi apda ata to sabse pahle tayar hote , aam dino mai langaro se kai log khate ye seva hota  Kai bate achi hai kya sab laya jaye   Inko samaj mai log murakh samjhte ya bolte 12 baj gaye , ya naseri bolte k ye log drugs lete fala wala ,   but nasa kon nahi karta , ek  16 sal ka Londa ho ya job karti londiya ho drugs leti mahangro mai ankho dekhi bat hai .

This is so sad hope covid will end
The people like this that become victim of dumb politician. Hope you,your fams and friends well sir.
Can someone provide a link where I could donate to either Jitender Ji or the organization that does free cremation?
Thanks China for the C19. Chinese Government should pay.
Bury them n stop the horrendous pollution. V sad tho.

Wag the dog

Running out of wood. They don't even have an oven to burn all the bodies using oil. I feel that you could take a flamethrower and burn everything.
I salute u sir u are a great man and a great inspiration
Running out of wood...They don't even have an oven to burn bodies using oil.
God bless you sir ji🙏
I was told by my school day's... India is rich country... But where...rich people need all money... Can't help to get oxygen to all... By this time they would have start production of xygen... No still all minister and rich people and bollywood and all stardum people kept their ass in silent mood... Idiots shame on all these people... At least try to help now ....
I beleived it until he started to blame the covid 19virus which originated in Cjina,  for the death of children.   Children are not dying from this virus from all stats the mortality rate for children is around 0.001 or less of total deaths from covid
I praise and respect  this Sikh  man. He has such a great heart and kindness. Pray 🙏 to India
They need  properly built like the Western crematorium , clean air , this situation for health reason , imagine people working there it's unimaginable .
Jitender ji deserve's  national award, actually he deserves more then that....
😭😭😭😭😭😭
Thanks bhaia ..but don’t allow the ashes to the family ..because ashes are also infectious
My utmost respect to Jitenderji.Cant imagine the toll on him; mentally n physically.
OMG this is heartbreak big time so many so quick what happened especially Vaccine producers are massive there but not thinking ahead  in their own Country. Bless you all in India from UK 🇬🇧.
Ab khud hinduon ko bhi samajh ajani  Cahye ky yeh hindu dharam kisi kam ka nhi hai jahan marny ky bad akhri rasomat bhi aziyat dyny wali ho...
India hospital kill them they don’t die if they young people in whole world not young people die from virus only those who have some previous issues Indian hospitals kill them for body parts to sell in rich market for rich people that is true it’s happened in Punjab villages when everybody get together that don’t touch our kids so they leave every time those hospital people came with cop arrests people and say they have virus not other family members only young one and take them forcefully to hospital than another and after 2 hours he is died one alone child 17 years old who only have fever in his family died in 2 hours and don’t touch his body cos you can get virus they open his body and see all body parts are gone he is empty people are ghost these days there is life like that god help them 😢

Shame on you modi
How come so many rich country couldn't help them....
India should recover. There is so much beauty in that land, which most of us has yet to witness.
Aap pr laakho salaam ❤️🙏🏻🌹💐
Sad but these moments of humanity were someone is willingly sacrificing there own time and potentially own health to help others are all going to be snuffed out by the history that's going to be written by all the governments around the world that weren't prepared, but could have been, years ago for this very situation we knew was coming one day, we knew for years and everyone(governments) sat around and did nothing!
Pray for india🙏🙏🙏🙏
So horrible fukin horrible
Respect these guys for helping arranging mass cremation and also Indian health services working tireless everyday to save as many critical patients. 🙏
This is game of modi , he just inocent people  to dye so the populaton can get less ,plz open your eyes
You, need green planet!
Sad

I am crying listen to this guy. My pray goes out to India!
And Trump says this is a hoax
God bless all ❤️❤️
Entire BJP govt. are uneducated religious fanatics who came to power by using Public's religious sentiments, PM himself was advising public, "Ghanta Baja", "Candle Jala", other BJP leaders were advising "Daru pee", "Gao Muteer Pee", "Goobhar Ashnan Kar". It was more important for them to win elections than save common poor Indians, Modi allowed election Rallies and Kumbh Mela without Masks. Message to common poor Indian, "If you still alive till Next Elections, do not vote for uneducated Chai wala, vote for some educated people who would build Hospitals and plan health care on scientific basis and not build Temples, no uneducated Pujari would save you from death, He doesn't have any vision.
Thank you sir
Jitendra sir aap ek unsung hero ho. You are a messenger of god. Sir its bcoz of you(like persons) humanity exists. BE SAFE SIR WE INDIANS ARE WITH YOU, IF YOU CAN KINDLY SHARE THE FOUNDATION'S PAYTM NO. WE CAN REALLY CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING TO UR CHARITY... PLZZZ DO SHARE,...
Modi government is busy making temples Instead of hospital College School
Same lies all over again. Hardly nothing. a city of 20 million, I would expect it to be heavy in deaths. not even confirmed covid cases. get real. sick of being lied to by the fake news
All because of china!!!!!!!!
I can imagine the odor of the flesh burning. I’m so sorry.
God bless india and people like him
China, are you watching this?? You better do.
Sun rays can help covid infected people.
Shantee. Jinder Mahal
God bless you sir
These people still don't get it ! India along either other countrys let their countries population get out of control.  Then they wonder why the rest of the planet doesn't come running to help. Then there are millions that immigrated to other country's only contribute to the overpopulation in the host country.  When there are too many rats in the house you need to address the situation.  I'm convinced that the CCP caused this to wreck India's economy and eliminate half the population  so there won't be as many to defend when they take over. Just my opinion.  End of story.
Have any countries helped with the oxygen machine or something?
Why don't u all burry them in earth ...
curb your population 😂😂😂🤣🤣😜😜😜😂🤣😜🤣😂
Krishna is a lying fake India is dying
His son is currently Covid positive. He is risking himself and his own family whereas there are people who are taking the benefit of the pandemic by selling essentials for thrice the normal price.
This man should be given Indias greatest award.
its all a lie god of war is dead
Wtf is really going on there?! Something is very strange about this! Just The vibes and the energy from watching it and know something is off...🤨🤔
May almighty God Jesus Christ bless you and ur family abundantly for ur kind-hearted Jiterder Ji....may u ll safe by grace of God.. u are the REAL HERO,💪 Big Salute for u....Jaihind.....🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳

He is a hero, giving service for free
Petra ( band ) - Show Your Power  Destroy your false gods ,  call upon Jesus to save you. One of .his names is Imannuael-  which means God with us  Matthew 1;23
God bless their souls. And i hope that the people actually stay and home and get rid of this sickness. Take care guys
Sikh (Singh) is King in this Trying time
Horrible to see this
It’s not the human dying it’s the humanity ...
Maybe we should switch to electric or gas cremations. In regular times we won't feel the need but in times like these....😢
He is a gem..
I am sorry I know a lot of people have lost their loved ones but, the Nature is working to strike a balance. Over population is destroying this planet. May everyone’s soul rest in peace.
It's so scary In our village till now there is not even 1 case what we will do if corona come here then we don't have hospitals also
Good job sir.
When your death also raises the global temperature:
This burial method is barbaric
Lucky are these remains cremated.  If these does not stop, soon bodies will be lying and rotting in the streets....God forbid
I would like to know how to donate. Wish Insider had given us a link or some more info on that.
The air around the city of Delhi is already so very polluted , burning all these bodies are only going to increase the SMOG level of the city. Try burying the dead's instead of burning, don't forget most people are dying for the lack of oxygen.
The global elite bankers are responsible for this tragedy
Riguler day in india 👁
God bless us and help us fight this battle for all of us in the world 🌎. 🙏🙏🙏
Endgame is really Happening
He is one of the unsung heroes that we have now during this pandemic. Thank you Sir for helping your fellow countrymen. ❤️
Lets together pray to God to save our countrymen...
Maybe building a few brick crematoriums would be more effective than just throwing bodies in a shallow pit with wood.
All them people dieing daily so must be kill they killing dem because I dont understand
WHY no IVERMECTIN?!
这位老兄是个好人！
This makes me think it's the end of the world... and we need God to save people and the world has a problem so pls stay safe everyone:(
No electric crematoriums in Delhi? Too Bad for those living in that area. Chennai Got Electric one 20 years back.
What happen to d government of ?
What did these evil people think they were accomplishing in this lab?! This should NEVER occur.
The Indian Government must be responsible for this,for that even African countries are much better than India.
Lies and fake news
these people that are working 24/7, risking their own lives in this pandemic are our real life superheroes...  Stay strong India... 🙏❤️
India is super stupendous. Thousands of cremations are spreading environmental pollution and shortening the oxygen level in the atmosphere. So, it's best to bury the dead.
This is just sad... but why are cricket games still going on???
Jesus Christ! Indians are generous people.
Covid-2021 is here boys
India, most of us in America grieve for the great evil this Covid has and is doing to your people, your country.  How do you feel China for what you have done?  Are you helping India with YOUR disease?  There will be a day of judgement.  For the Lord God will not let this go unpunished
Chinese gift to the world.

Bhagwan aap sad log ki Bhala kare. Jitender Ji, Dhanyavad...aap ki seva ke liye Sat Sri Akal

So china was wrong ? At some level they were.
FRAUD! There showing scenes from the people that died in the gas leak explosion that happened in May of 2020. This is a total fraud.
This happens when there is unjustuce to annocent people in a society.this has been in india where RSS used swords to kill its own citizens who were minorities.this is just a picture , they have to see the trailer
😿 Please stay at home
Very bad situation. Why there are no electric crematoriums in Delhi?
Hats off sir....salute from sri Lanka...
Shanti ji ki himmat hey
May god heal heal our country😭
How sad.   Please let us know how to help dear God
THIS IS HEART BREAKING!! 😢
India is a country run by uneducated, criminals, greedy and egoistic people in power. This is normal. No surprises on seeing the current situation. An advise to all the foreigners - never in your lifetime visit this country.
My goodness...i didn't know india was hit this bad!
Modi will name this after covid-19 over as Modi Crematorium just like Modi Stadium.
amazing;we in the west have no idea what life is like in india,of course we don't know what he is saying.what did they die of?104 degree heat?starvation,thanks to modi?the flu?has anyone checked?how about just one differential diagnosis by a reputable dr.
bless him bless him

Salute to sardarji... Aor khakhi chaddi wale desh bhakt kaha hai ??
Have you not yet realize that the people who are dying are the ones vaccinated? Where is the people’s outrage? around the world people are being accept to be killed and continue to accept this garbage and paralyzed with fear? We have the power to stop all of this if people wake up to the truth. The real covid is in the injections, not in the people before  receiving this poison.  This is a depopulation genocide being pushed and the only way for people to accept being exterminated like rats is by fear, lies and deception. Wake up people stop offering yourselves to the slaughter for a virus created by them and a 99.10 % chances of survival,,,,, what are you people doing? Stop taking this injection
He is brave 🙏🙏 god bless him
judging by the news lies, every person in India will be dead in a couple months
I think their spreading more by burning body's the smoke is going into the air spreading its not good it give off viper like droplets of water from the body's while burning I think thay should use a proper  cremation with lock doors and theirs people are there burning body's not good where the health authority's I think thay need to think about this to much are  handling the body's not good from what I can see
Beyond heartbreaking!  India should jump to Chinese help, get politics out of it.  China has the big heart, massive capacity, extensive experience and superb speed to rescue Indians from this catastrophe.
El pcch y Rusia se salieron con la suya!!

Govt failed to arrange oxygen supply because of death in hospitals and home. At least Govt arrange the fire wood to cremate the bodies
As am Sikh, I feel so proud! Waheguru Ji will be so proud of you of helping the people in need. God bless!
Modi govt busy in selling india for political benefits future election funds and misusing the constitution system for destroying opposition parties, public daily life.  Modi supporting internal terrorists like criminals, corrupted person and evil politician for political benefits. Criminals and corrupted person ruling the state. No democracy, no Freedom speech and injustice
Shameless media showing the dead bodies and burning pyres at the time of Covid. Do you do the same with your country's Covid deaths too?
Your No. 1 vaccine maker but you cannot vaccinized your people you have powerful arms guns money nuclear but because your leaders is corrupt thats what will happen.
You, sir that make me still believe in humanity. May God Protect us
Jehovah will make sure this will never happen n the new paradise all this sickness  is because of Adam n eve n we suffer so dam sad man every body I pray for to jehovah every one hold strong amargdon  is almost here n all this wicked will be no more n new paradise
Some leaders of india are corrupt and ignorant.some rich people they dont care that why it happen so many are dying
China manufactured the CoronaVirus in a laboratory.
If we never accept our limitations as a species , such as losing a small portion of us from a uniquely perfect; often asymptomatic virus, we consign ourselves to an eternal state of fear and avoidance of life.   As tragic as scenes like this are, we need to accept the reality that covid kills generally those who would die from the next bout of severe flu, or other highly stressful illness.   There's hardly any flu deaths anymore , and this reduced number should be taken off the covid death toll for a valid assessment of it's reach and damage.  Yes, it's easy for me to say being young and healthy.  But I would hope I would hold to the same principle , as well as putting individual liberty above all else , if I  was one of the vulnerable.  I know many in that category who do.
so sad remembering all the loved ones of families who have died in India and a very big prayer to those who work hard for free to help with the medical services.
,
I love you india 🇸🇦
Omg
🤣🤣🤣
:/
i wonder what is the smell of the death when they burn it, i think the reason why covid in india rapidly increase bcoz of the smell and smoke of the death ,just opinion ,Im a muslim so this is so sad to see but i respect what they believed and i hope MAY ALLAH PROTECT US  and keep us safe ameen stay strong india💪
Can’t believe this is real life, not some action movie it’s actually happening.
In india our media is sold those who crticize modi the anchors of modi media rips him off calling them - anti nationals, paksitani, terrorists ... I wish all modi media persons should get covid and die it's harsh but govt don't have fear of media because govt manages media
God bless this man!
Thank you, Jitender ji...
This man is an absolute angel and hero. May God bless him and I pray he gets anything he desires in life.
as u saw so shall u reap🔥 free kashmir🔥
Juskuu pakatatag po kayong lahat. I hope this will end soon. We gladly appreciated on what you are doing Sir. We thank you sir
F
All the nations must start to reconsider their priorities !!! Build more hospitals !! Save humanity !
Stop hyping this BS about India! We know it is all lies. Just more fear porn!
BJP = bharat jalao party... literally this time
You are polluting the world's air and the air of the Covid patients. Time to respect the planet and people and stop this burning tradition.
Until now i dont see any politician or leaders of your country in any video or news report. Am i right?
Not sure why there are no many haters that disliked it. There is no reason to dislike. He is doing a great work for a great cause.
Call your god cow, hahaha😂😂😂
Come on hindu people, continue worshipping cow, you think cow can help you as your god😂😂😂
This is depressing. Indian govt and local administration should have done more, this is no way to die. I just hope and pray that Imran Khan handles this crisis better in Pakistan than Modi did in India.
I'm so sorry for the people of India. I'm from Thailand.
Not to forget that its extremely hot summer right now. To be in ppe and around fire in this heat.... that in itself is brutal.
Prayers for our Indian brothers and sisters..
It must be just like having a barbeque every day...
My prayers go out for India 🙏🏾
Salute to you sir
How f**king sad 😢 this is horrible. My heart goes to you India 😞
prayers are with you from canada
So where are the morons who keeps insisting that covid is just like a flu??
jitender ji....we in malaysia...could imagine the situation over there...we salute u...getting things properly managed...hats off to you sir...👍👍👍
Total bullshit propaganda being used to scare the public to death...........do your own independent research and ignore these government funded networks.....millions of doctors and specialists speaking out against the lies being spewed out by the media....go on Brand new-tube
Same as it’s always been. Fake news
And the show must go on. Corrupt evil people who want to rule the world! Stand up people, do not let you’re self get foold! Take no vaccin because it isn’t what you think it is!
All because the vaccins...
Allah tallah sabko murdar karey modi washal ko bhi
Allah murdar karey
Indian religious believes almost turned this country into ruin... And burial customs in these humanitarian crisis seem to be completely unfiting the reality.

May Allah protect India from this destruction (Aameen)
May you & your loved ones be blessed & protected 🙏❤
Salute this all frontline workers ❤️🙏🏽
May god bless us all ❤️🙏🏽
Carbon footprint?
May God help the humanity.....Pak stands with India in such critical times
Many blessings for comfort and peace during these very hard days.  Wish I could supply you with endless amounts of wood forever. My heart aches with you.
Sad. God save India.
Modi’s India ☹️ keep voting for mandhirs instead of governance and development
😂🇱🇰
Please as JESUS CHRIST OUR SAVIOR to cleanse this abomination...HE IS OUR ONLY SAVIOR!!! YOU WORSHIP DEMIGODS...JESUS CHRIST IS OUR ONLY SAVIOR...
These are the real heroes, not the politicians!
Hero
The guy is Sikh and he's helping perform Hindu funeral rituals. That's what real multiculturalism looks like America & Europe.
This is all bullshit !
"Ghar me oxygen nahi he or o mor ja ti he... "... This sentence broke my heart..
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Please Lord help India 🙏🏼 . This is so sad 😢
God please help the people of India.
It’s the vaccines
Where's the link to donate 🤷🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
omg
This is why pandemic deniers make me so angry. "Just a flu." Just because it isn't your family.... Always be empathetic. This is real.
This NOT COVID ITS THE VACCINES.  ITS DEPOPULATION OF INDIA.
India is destroyed by Modi
Wow thats crazy
300K Indians recover everday too and 2 million Indians get vaccinated everyday. Please respect privacy of Indians who have lost family members for this Pandemic porn.
Pray for India
Pls help pryers what ever our religion  god help us.🙏🙏🙏
Kali and Shiva smile on this man, and you should too. Gods bless this man for what he and his warriors due to honor the dead.
Where are all those celebs now? Only Sonu Sood seems to be doing something
Why isnt the world helping them.. They need assistance... Where is the help they need.
Many blessings to all those suffering in India from Los Angeles
my Sikh brother thanks you so much for doing this
How can we donate ???
if he alone already carried 45k dead bodies, I don't know if the 220k death toll reported by the Indian government is even close to reality.
After first wave of virus Indian government has 8 months to prepare for 2nd wave. But they did nothing. instead they did election rallies, cricket matches in big stadiums. kumbh mela, everything open for public and careless public don't even wear mask...people died due to no oxygen and hospital not because they have corona..my heart cry everyday watching this.God please help my people.
I’m American but I’m so sad and deeply sorry for this smh
Nooooooooo this is not real. This is fake news😭😭😭😭😭. You can't just expose India like that 😭😭😭. This is our internal matter😭😭🙄. All Hail Modi.
How was it in mass graves in New York and italy? Show some macabre footage from there too, you sickos
There are still people who believe COVID is not real. People are dying all over the world not just in US. Prayers for the victims and their families.
Total fault goes to BJP POLITICIANS AND MODI. He slaughter Muslims like animal. Now face the Devine justice. India will break into many parts.  IA
Covid was used to get rid of Trump. Modi next....
Indian need krrish
215 000 deaths out of 1.3 billion is 0,015%
Game for the Thrones is played well, People are just considered voting insects, as you remain divided it’s not going to change  Public has to think beyond their petty politics and come forward with one and only one platform accountability. Thanks

This is same dehli we're Muslim daughter were raped by terrorists group some hindo and Muslims men's were killed
My salute to this brave and noble guy. His work must be appreciated and acknowledged by government. I request,  he must be awarded with Padma award for such great work.thanks for his generous and kind service in such a difficult time where people are self centered.
Wow
Is there a GoFundMe for his cause
My heart is broken for India and I’m ashamed we are not doing more to help and stop people’s suffering. Cannot believe this is happening and what images I’m seeing.
Very bad situation indian donald trump doesn't care how many people die
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN INDIA   THINK ABOUT THIS ONE  ........................................  IS WHAT WOULD HAVE   ...............HAPPENED..........  IF DONALD TRUMP HAD WON THE PRESIDENCY.   THINK ABOUT THIS ONE !?!?!?!?
Bharat Ratna dena hoga inko ❤️🙏🥺
Its not only humans that are dying, its humanity too.....
God help all people
God, please protect and calm this world. Protect the doctors, heal the people of this deadly pandemic. Work through the hands of each medical staff and give them the strength to carry on for each person fighting this virus. God, I pray in the name of your son Jesus, our Lord and Savior.
This is terribly sad
Thank you sir.
Sad to say it was all planned to have mass population controll. Thanks the the yellow people and the man with the most money in the world.
Trying to take over China's spot as #1 polluters
Welcome to the New World Order all planned and staged
Thank you I pray 🙏 may God bless you & everyone in India from the UK God bless you brother
Dats  sad
Rip to all dead
Question to foreigners from India. Our government keeps saying don't tarnish India's image by broadcasting grim and sad news about this crisis. So I ask you, do you Care about India's image or ok with the citizens holding India's government accountable?
In order to make profits in the stock market/Bitcoin investment one has to have a good strategy and proper knowledge of how the holders manipulate the market.
Gods bless this beautiful, strong soul.
bill and wife responsable
Media = corona
Allah sabko apni hifzo aman Aameen sumaeen
if the covid is rising still than maybe all of you should start to respect the basics of covid rules....social distancing, and lockdown.....it is not the government who infect everyone, you are sitting there in textile masks what everyone knows....not ok....basically you should get your country out of the middle age. Stop to be dirty, stop to make babies endlessly, and stop to make always someone else responsible....and when the drama hits naturally.....stop to freak out.
He deserves national award. Such people are inspiration for humans of earth amidst of worldy pleasure and materialistic fun. They forget they r going turn into ash or be buried one day.
To all indians who are praising this sikh for his efforts or praise sikhs for their humanitarian efforts around the world, they must remember that 90% of sikhs are still peacefully protesting in Delhi for their land, agricultural identity and way of life. I urge you all to support these people and protect their interests in India.
Prayers for all those that have lost family members in India and for them as well.  At least here in the USA 🇺🇸, we are able to bury our loved ones, or cremate them privately not in the street or bury them with many others in deep pits.  I don’t know if Americans know how lucky we are.   Unfortunately We have lost over 500,000 Americans.  I pray that this Pandemic  😷 is stopped and Americans can lead near normal lives. 😇🇺🇸
let these CHINESE see what they did to HUMANITY  themselves!!
That is so sad 😭
🙏🙏🙏
A True Indian.  Hats of Sir. We bow down to your humility and service.
एक तरफ ऐसे लोग हैंं जो अपना घर बेच भी सेवा कर रहे , दूसरी तरफ कैजरीवाल हैंं पिछले 3 महीनो मे 150 करोड़ रुपय फूँक डाला अपने ऐड मे , एक ओक्सिजन प्लान्ट नहीं लगवा पाया
اتقوا الله واستغفروا هذا كله من اصنامكم وعبادتكم للابقار والقرود والفئران  حسبنا الله ونعم الوكيل👀💔
And we know who is responsible.
I don t adam it
Will Indian politicians learn any thing from these tragdues   Will Indians look for political leaders with honesty, integraty , loving and care to its people or all these don’t matter despite
lets keep the cases going ! i wanna get it to 40 million by sepember
Listen douroud e taj (available at play store) For.corona protection  Love from Pakistan 🇵🇰 ♥ may Allah safe all of us
Meanwhile...... not a single scam call in the last 2 weeks from 6 a day to 0 ....hey pros and cons just saying
Is this really a story that needed to be told? All the suffering over the past year and you have to add to it with this macabre garbage?
Dead bodies of child children usually dont die from covid may god help them but it seems like they are killing the poorest people
At this point wearing full on hazmat suits is normal
Thanks and all the prayers id good wishes to these volunteers    They are hope when the government completely failed in India
But yet they always said it would be Africa to be in trouble!! They always think low of Africa and Black people!
But I do believe Sikhs deserve a medal for this or at least something special
When the comments say Sikhs have a kind heart I be like  I don’t have a kind heart lol since I’m Sikhs religion
All Indian political leaders are  all hoax, no helps, no oxygens, no transportations, no foods for poor people, no vaccinations, no oxygen , no coordinations, infrastructure etc. haven’t seen Indian political leaders addressing the issues.  Looks like they  are all temporarily herbanating until slow down covid 19 cases
Hey god hey world please help my country innocent people 😭😭😭😭
Is the guy get into the car put hand sanitizer on the gloves ? He touches car surfaces, etc with gloves, but if the gloves contaminated with the virus, he might spread it more.
All my fellow brothers and sisters please save yourselves and you family.. now this is very serious .. please wear masks.. go out only necessary.  Rich please help the poor people please .... 😭😭😭😭😭😭 Heartbreaking scenes..
Something else is going on here. Its not the virus.
You folks think the pandemic is bullshit now? 😧☠
How can we help him ? Where to donate
Burn China.
Does anybody know if China has sent help too I heard news that they also would help India out ???
Why don't the burn them in a crematorium,?
Isliye toh yeh sardar ko har news channel meh dikhai deraha hai...
Once again, Sikhs stepping where the government fails its people
Humanity died a long time ago my friend. It's sad that many have just been starting to notice
Respect ✊ to you Sir 🙏🏽
Clothing transmits the virus.
vaccination propaganda
India has the worst government in the world that’s why. This virus exposes a governments flaws.
india..did u remember same thing when it happen with Kashmiri ppl? Did u forget same like this small girls cried when they raped... Thats from Allah ...
Someone should open a gofundme for this man after all this...the trauma and risk he is taking is incredible
I hope this man can get some sleep,  he works so hard and cares so much.
Well India you know exactly who to blame... time for payback.
God bless India whatever are God's
Looks like china deployed a biological weapon against India and the world. But our thief in the white house is fighting Russia. Instead of uniting the world and making China pay.
Fell so sorry to hear about India hey vagwan save India
I wish there was a way to donate directly to this service perhaps to build crematories for his organization.
How can I help from the US? I pray for you India I love you all. Please how can I help? Thank you for what you do sir.

Salute to this man
Shameless Bhakts had told these Sikhs as Khalistani terrorist have these people no sense of shame
How can we donate to him
jai hind! India is a super power and the best country in the world!
Respect ❤️🙏
Sikhs are helping with covid crisis while modi government is trying to gain votes by bashing Sikhs
I have got tears in eyes. I will respect you till death Sir❤️
God Bless this man and the workers who preform all these cremations and do it giving the dead and the families some dignity. God Bless the families of all these dead people and the ones who pass from Covid and other causes.
The government of india is not doing lockdown because the vote counting is going on for two states....... Government is not taking deaths seriously but taking vote counting seriously, shameful
Who believes in a cow as God. They deserve it.
All together now, thank you quid pro quo Beijing Joe BuyThem & CHINA
When you think you’re seen the worst of humanity, your also shown the best of it, karma will reward those that put others before themselves in time.   Aroha & Nui te aroha from Aotearoa  (stay strong & love from NZ)
Jitender ji.. Great respect for u.. God bless u..
It's really hard to watch.. And Jitendraji said something meaningful "Humans are not dying, Humanity is".
India is the furture Asian power of Corona virus the begger are begging for oxygen for all over the world but still its too late one day 400,000 cases x 7 days = 2800,000 now these people are crying All the time Indian people and india media said Pakistan died from the Crona virus when frist case come too Pakistan And now India begging for oxygen 😂🤣and soon now its India in all the times in international news 😂
Is there a way to donate to his organization
God Bless you sir and your family abundantly ❤💐
Is there water in those yellow and red stuff pouring on the body is it to make the body stay alive turn to ashes or get it moisture?
Ohhh Allah plz help us help India ......it's soooo hard to watch people crying 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Its unbelievable that a big country with 4th or 5th largest GDP fails to secure basic needs. But people like Jitender are humanity at its best. I don't share your belief neither am I from your country but your amazing dedication is an inspiration to me....and Thank you for all your services. Now Africa take a big note. Africa should be ready, this is not gonna be treated with some traditional medicine, chili powder or some liquor concoction. You got to take this extremely seriously.
Who dislikes this
So sad.  I feel for the people of India.
In sorry to hear this
The more people in a country the more that die so this seems about right
Jitender ji is the real hero. Please provide the link where we can donate to his organisation.
Can you please share the details, so the each one of us contribute some money as a donation. 🙏 It takes guts to do what he is doing that too for free, He's a real hero.
Can viruses be killed in cremation?
God bless you Sir. 🙏🏼
My thoughts and prayers to the people of India. This is so heartbreaking. I've also dealt with an uncle dying of Covid, and a brother (a nurse) who was incubated for almost 2 weeks, and almost died. So, I can only imagine how terrible it is to have numerous friends and family members dying around you. R.I.P to all the loved ones that have moved on.
🙏
Thank china for this
Think about it this way COVID killing the scammers in India 🇮🇳  that’s a win for us victims
JESUS CHRIST IS COMING VERY SOON!!!  BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST AND REPENT FROM YOUR SINS🙏🙏 NO TIME LEFT!!!!!
Without prejudice  I have witnessed some of indian clips where police and hindu saints are seeking help from Allah "Muslim GOD"  This affliction is a test for all of us specially who made competitor along side of one GOD and time to reflect on these grounds.  Some 1400 years ago facts found in Muslim scripture for foresight.  "& When the board a ship (in whirlpool)they supplicate Allah, Sincere to him in religion,But when he delivers them to land ,at once they associate others with them."( Chapter 29 Verse 65)  I am not preaching anyone it is just a thought for reflection as we all are thought leaders and on some extent want to live and die peacefully.  Respect and prayers for all indian brothers and sisters

Dil toot gaya yeah dekhkar life is nothing 😢
Meanwhile in the USA republican people don't want to get vaccinated!!!! LOL
They tried their new strain... Georgia Guidestones
I can't imagine the stench.
My prayers for the people in India. This is so terribly sad. ❤️
That man is not a human. He is an angel
Off topic here but if that was in the USA the cremation costs would be thousands smh
When government fails and people like him step up...I have no words...🙏🙏🙏🙏
Im Roman Catholic from Philippines and I always admire Sikhism. That man with a yellow turban is a Sikh and he still follows the hindu cremation just to honor the dead. I love this man. You are haeven sent. God bless Sikhism. Long live!
And how many of them got the covid vaccine?? 80%?...
Jitender Singh Shunty Ji - How can I donate some funds to your organization - Aap bahut hi nek kaam kar rahe hain - Wahe Guru ji ka haat sab par rahe !!
All this is New World order collaboration and propaganda, Freedom is at issue here, CHRIST came to set us free not only from sin,  but fear. If we fear this Man made Weaponized version of corona more than we fear God then it’s all over for America anyway... many more millions of lives have been lost from corrupt governments than fabricated pandemics!
Maybe India needs to assess its priorities in spending. They have had nuclear weapons since about 1990, but healthcare and basics are lacking.
Why are u descriptions and killings muslims? THIS IS THE PUNISHMENT OF ALLAAH.  اللهم احصهم عددا واقتلهم بدادا ولا تغادر منهم أحدا اللهم امين.
Salute to this national hero and his team🙏
i Williams donate 1000 thousun dollars
Mind Begs the Question: Rules - if apply to People Rules - if dont apply to ruling Politicians Ruled by - Just,Unjust?
Mind Begs the Question: If a PM/Govt Will only give Speeches,Monologues Will not give Answers Sign of - Democracy,Dictatorship?
How come they never mention victims that are men....."I've seen the dead bodies of small children and women".... I am sure more men died protecting women and children by going out there getting resources! Even in normal circumstances men die more due to health, work, and war!
Every problem has a solution in ISLAM. Whether corona or any other problem can be resolved if we Follow Quran and Sunnah completely. Plus we get heaven for eternity after death.

India became a worst country since modi came in to power
This just seems like a completley insane job. Not sure how many bodies I'd be comfortable handling these days.
It's our failure as country that we not takeal any lesson from suffering countries in past ,  it's totally gone wrong. But like jintendraji as human being serve and doing great work for people, its truely inspirational and hope to overcome this deadly pandemic 🙏🙏
1:25 My heart breaks for that lady I feel your pain god give u strength ❤
Zee news , APB NEWS , AJJ TAK NEWS . WON'T SHOW HOW PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING IN THERE HEADLINE . ITS FOREIGN NEWS CHANNEL WHO ARE SHOWING INTREST IN BRINGING OUT THE TRUTH. BUT ITS PEOPLE MISTAKE WHO VOTE ON BASE RELIGION AND RESULT IS IN FRONT OF YOU 😣😣😣😣
Kabtak ye corona  hum insan logon ko parisan karega  bhagwan kabtak
The Ganges is polluted. Stop bathing in it.
What a wonderful man, giving people some respect during the worst time possible.
👍
My heart goes out to the Indian people.  May Allah SWT bless Jitender Ji and grant him ease.  Ameen.
Basic things like water and food and shelter and healthcare should be readily available to every person on this planet because there is no reason it shouldn’t be, no reason.
I am so sorry.  Now we should come to realize what the Covid-19 has brought to humanity.  The WHO is a corrupted organization, helping to destroy human lives, not to save lives.  God needs to have his wrath on the corrupted murderers.
How nice to do this.  So very sad to see so many bodies, and the lack of government support.  The government needs to pay this and be sure their people have the proper burial
I'm crying watching this. Already played Plague Game (from Google Play Store) several times, but never know that the true story will be a nightmare. It's still a nightmare even if you already imagined it. I am sorry for your loss, India. Wish our world gets better, wish world and government takes better and wiser policies after these pandemic years.
Indian PM conducted uncountable election rallies when covid is peaking. The Indian PM is solely responsible for COVID Spread. He is a super spreader threat to the entire international community.
How many people died there everyday pre- fake virus?
No words. HEY US!!! Your people refuse to take the vaccine and everyone who wanted it, got it already! Help them with treatments!! SEND THESE PEOPLE VACCINES!!!!!
They are the real hero... "Insan mora Insanyot nehi".. Salute u sir...
RIP 🙏🙏🙏
I hope Indian people will realize now who are the real hero in their country. In this worst time you will see who the real human being is. GOD bless to those offer their services with out nothing in return, just pure love and value to humanity. They dont deserve a medal or any reward here on earth but  a highest place in the next life. To all Sikhs👏👏
He deserves bhart ratna nd not ny politician
Vote for modi. 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai'
Sikh brothers and sisters are some of the most humble, kind and brave-hearted people I’ve ever met. As a Muslim I pray for your health and safety, and everyone else affected by this catastrophe in India.
Guy said they died for no good reasons. I never knew there was a good way to die lol
Guys like him get priced Nd give civil awards Not all that overpaid cricketer n actors
Is anyone thinking about pollution due to these funerals??? And after they throw the ashes in the river...God knows what will happen after all this
Your work ease the burden and pain, of the deceased and their families. Though you may never see this, but you sir are performing a great act in the eye of god. And although we are different beliefs, I pray you and your staffs stay safe so you may carry on. Take pride good sir. And may your good deeds be returned many times Over
😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥God help us...
Modi must go..
Present government didn’t do any preparation and efforts for counter it. They now preparing for Maha kumbh for making conditions more worse.
who are these 272 parasites who have disliked this video?
God Bless you
💔💔💔
He is a hero in this war.. Deserve an appreciation from the government.
My cincere condolences to you and your country, Pakistan stand with India 🇵🇰🇮🇳
Thank you 🙏🏻 helping 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻😭😭
I just feel sorrow for those peoples,  Nobody deserve nothing of this
Bohat dilkharaash manzar hain.. Allah Paak Nabi Paak k sadqay mahe ramzaan k sadqay rehm kijiye insaniyat par.. Ameen..
It requires a lot of courage to stand in such a situation and do work. This man is doing social service at the cost of his own life. But I don't think the government has any heart, they lost their souls.
You should ask Dr Zakir Naik..only he know the solution
All government systems have failed their citizens. This shouldn’t be happening but the government wants to pocket the money leaving the citizens with the burden. God bless everyone and stay safe.
Sab modi ka kch sajish hai ......plz koi ye bta doo foreign me log  q nii mare....hamare india me q mare log
They are  one of the richest countries in the world and the poorest they have the revenue for vaccines.. no social distancing they're crowded in like sardines it's just like China
Oh God worst ,  every day media counts  number of deaths in figure, but these are  not numbers. these are deaths of humanity ,  emotions,  feelings of every family of there loved one's.
Thousands of them barefooted that's how they walk around in India especially in the slums. Wet markets animal abuse Etc. Communist China is the same way except they have futuristic buildings and dress a lot nicer they're disgusting
You need wood to burn bodies because of covid? NYC needs wood to build outdoor dining shacks because of covid. Funny how the same pandemic is so different in so many places
🙏🙏
Meanwhile politicians be like don’t blame me,.......smh
Turn you lives over to Jesus Christ ,remove your gods and stop listening to antichrists
Stop pretending that india has not ALWAYS burned their bodies, also the country has a population of 1.2  BILLION. Stop fear mongering.  Just 10 years ago they were reporting how india burns so many dead it was effecting climate change. Stories change like the wind
Jitender jii should be awarded,, he is soo kind and humble,,,
Here in America 69.5 % of isnt fully vaccinated and we have already reached the point where the cases and deaths are significantly down. But liberals wont rest until most of the population is fully vaccinated so they can say science did it .Beware of antichrists- they want to control you through satanic lies
Heartbreaking.Praying for these people.
Great Human being
sad to say.. but currently india looks like nazi concentration camps .
Wah sardar ji Wah app me sardari ka haqu Ada ker diya ..Salam hai apko... Lekin afsos serkar app Ko Bharat ratn nahi degi ..aor app se bada hero nahi koi..... Salam hai brother....

I have a serious concern here.  With so many fires burning, there is a serious risk of CO levels exceeding safe levels.  People are so overcome by grief that they are not worried about these things.  There are no chimneys, everything is in the open air.   Huge air pollution.  We must think of alternative methods which are less polluting.  I am afraid there will be deaths from smoke inhalation and CO poisoning.
मोदी को फांसी होगी अगर ऑक्सीजन ब्लॉक करने वालों को फांसी दी जाए?
Thank you sardar ji. God bless you all
Never thought I'd see my countrymen go through such misery. And we were promised achhe din..
Huge respect 🙌🏼
How do we donate to him and his cause so he doesnt even have to think to sell his home to continue his cause of cremation for free.
"It's not humans that are dying, it's humanity that has died."   This broke my heart.
A hero. Indeed.
oh my God😥🙏please you guy's stay at home and keep safe😏🙄😥
Khusron ke desh me Mard
Ab ki bar fir modi  aur yogi sarkar
Blessings on this man
And its godi media
Now where is modi ji
Is there a donation link you can provide for us?
Thanks a lot to you and your team Jitender sir. What you are doing is beyond gratitude and words. May you and everyone else keep safe and healthy.
Paji ..God bless u and keep you safe out there   What to do sir !!! Current gov. does not want APP to be strong that's why Delhi is made to suffer as this gov. Want to stay forever .. It's all dirty politics and innocent people have to pay the price with their life's  People of India at list now open your eyes  Only rich and becoming more rich n poor people suffering...
This is a living nightmare that I can’t wake up from.  It’s already been 14 months of this.  How much more can we take?  How many more deaths?  How many more mass graves?
Paji mujhe rona aagaya aap ki baate sunn ke paji aap insaan ke roop me bhagwan ho salute dil se 😭😭😭😭😭😭🙏🙏
India me jub Muslims ko sataya ha ese musebat ai ha
Modi killed us. Only common people helping each other
God bless this man x
All this because of modiji🙏🏻
God bless jatinder
They were killing Muslims before this....let those we did be safe
What a dirty disgusting country
I will breakdown and cry, these people doing what they have to do. They don't have time to feel sad, angry, happy. Carry the body, buried the body or burn the body
Sir u r awsome... May god bless u and ur family. Love from entire humanity 🙏🙏🙏
Naman hai ap ko👍🙏
Thank you for your service. May God bless  and protect you and your dear ones.
Crematorium...in future need wood in future..if this rate  body's comes....no safety. No oxygen  silly death   on God knows our future
Just imagine if India had a better health system. Might only have been 0.5% death rate.
Sin will kill us all
Dios bendiga. Cristo les ama. La sangre preciosa de mi Dios Jesucristo cubra a toda la India hermoso y bello país y a toda la humanidad. Amén. From Panamá city. Amén.
If wood runs out, dig a grave. This is not the time to follow rituals. We must have presence of mind.
Aisay community ki izzat logo ki nazron mein Banti hai,.  Way jitender zee, wahey guru, bhgwan aap pey aur aapkey parivaar pey apna sada aashirwaad banaayey rakhey....ek taraf jitender g, aur ek taraf gurdaron mein oxygen ...salute to all sachey Indian Sikh samaaj nu
They only need the oxygen to alive.The india government is a murderer,it is so useless.
May God bless you jitender ji
Does anyone know how to donate to this crematorium that Jitendar Singh Shanty ji work in? He said he is doing these cremations for free And will do it even if he has to sell his house. Such a kind soul. would love to donate.
God be with you Sardaar ji.......😭😭🙏🙏

I see 248 MF disliked this video.. shame on you all
Respect for sardarji 🙏
Should've given a link or website to help him instead of plugging in all of your social media platforms
🙏🙏🙏
He is real hero
Thank you Sir!!
Stop giving awards to celebrities... Instead give it to that Sikh man.
Imagine the stench of burning bodies in that area 🤢
N95s save lives
With love and prayers to you sadarji 🙏
Tragic and scary.  Just to inform you that N95s are tested and approved and provide superior respiratory protection than cloth or other masks.  Get online and order N95s.
Fantastic coverage on the very public Cremation Process in India, what about the ashes? How about out of the city?  How about some links to donation sites?  What food sources and product sources does India provide to the world?  What is their global population, what is their normal daily death rates before covid and now?  Give us a complete over view on everything India because its coming to every country....  What about recording of names?  Lineage, property, why has no one is western countries been advertising will, trusts, estate planning...  Gardening, home survival ?
he said true since we literally destroy nature so far as you can how covid only affects to the human but not nature but still we haven't learned our lesson and we still don't respect the nature...i believe when we learn it will be already too late.
India is busy sending rockets to space instead spending on oxygen for people
Administration should learn a lot of things from wrest of the world , how they are caring their own citizen.
Will pray for your team , yourself and family ' s wellbeing. Your bravery is inspiring Jitendraji. 🙏
drama to da max
so sad 😪
Alloh Alloh murka
People in there just be strong we been through a lot during this pandemic but here with my family we manage to cure alternative medicine like herbal treatment we been through into cough my mother is prone to covid because she has history asthma and pneumonia and my daughter, we tried our best soon the symptom started we treat it by ginger tea inhaling the aroma take paracetamol right away take immediately or use this method if it's hard to breathe go and boil water put a pinch of salt then use face towel wet the face towel through hot water squeeze it then put this on your back you have to feel the warmth feeling when it's getting cooler again wet again into hot water put this as well on your chest but warmer the results is proven and trust God.

Sorry for India 🇮🇳🙏😢
God bless you brother
Yeh uncle kon hy inka naam kia hy
It so painful yooo
Sikh's have the biggest heart in India
How can I donate money to Mr. Jetendra (a God-sent angel).  Please advise accordingly, so that I can get all my friends in Malaysia to help him out.  Thank  you
Sardarji bhagwan apka aur apke pariwar ka dhyan rakhe..yei dua h
Modi. He only cares about the votes. A useless and incompetent leader. Kick him out of office. Bring in a real leader to sort out the situation and save lives.
Didn't India refuse to observe social distancing or wear mask? Now they are feeling the wrath of god.  A video show them walking around believing that one of the superior rulers will protect them... i think this is a major reality check for them and the golden calf they praise...
Intermectin medicine (the human brand) for Covid 19
These are medical soldiers! salute!
I keep you in my thoughts and pray for India and all of you every day. You all have much courage. Thank you.
So much respect for this man. praying for India 🇮🇳 rt now
"insan nahi insaniyat mar rahi h" ...abhi bhi vakt h sbhi sudharne ki koshish kare apne or apne pariwar ke liye.
I am a Delhiite, and I salute this man for the service he is doing. I would rate it no less than a prayer. And cann't agree more than humanity is dying in this city, at a fast rate without clean air and empathy.
Allah protect you, your family and people like you Jitendar Ji.
Nobel exists for man like this, god bless you 🙏🏻
I think I found the next spot I want to poo at!
I have seen this guy few times on YouTube now and I whole heartedly Thank You sir and ur Team for ur Unconditional service. Living Hero 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Beyond heartbreaking! Modi failed India people.  Get the politics out of it. Get help from everyone including China.  China is willing to help with massive capacity, superb speed and extensive experience.  Human against virus!
nightmare!!!
Jitubhai dilse saalam  apko
Not all Saints need to be born in one religion particularly. Saints have no religion; only humanity is their religion. God bless you Saint Jitender ji.
Sir you are a super hero really
aap mahan ho sir
Hi bless one,I love India,I will be praying for your familys, from USA ,
YOU CANT CREMATE BODIES TO ASHES WITH STICKS! If you believe this BS you're the stupidest jerk on the planet. A population of TWO BILLION and he has a tiny lot setup to burn bodies with STICKS.
As many dying per capita as us at its peak don’t be fooled by the media people , 1.3billion people live in India and in far worse conditions than 99% of USA 3 times the population 3 times the numbers ? Nothing to see here but media will try their best to make it sound bad
What a load of absolute bullshit
This is all bs. Cremation has always been an issue in india. They have been burning bodies in the streets for decades. "gasping for breath in the streets" Yes, 9 000 000 a year die from pollution a year in India. 3000 a day from hunger and 1300 a day from cancer. More people die from the shits in India daily that drug murders in Mexico in a year. All you are doing is highlighting was has been happening there for decades and calling it a covid crisis.
You are Brave and kind human being, thank you Sadhar ji.....
Poleni India GOD atawaona through hii time ngumu
DELHI IS THE WORLD'S WORST CAPITAL CITY.🔥
Is there any link to donate for your organisation..please mention
God bless the individuals going through this in every country  Very tough and scary times for us all  Jitender Singh and his crew of workers Thank you for what your doing
O Allah protect to my muslim ummah 🤲 ameen indeed you are most merciful.
My tears 😭 when I watching this video better soon Indian
most efficient is the Islamic way .. very eco friendly too .. no harm to environment
Humanity is dying through lack of oxygen. Please governments around the world take care of basics of your people first before military expenses.
Fire is the purest, Fire ends all, Fire starts all, Let all these fires make a better future, and make our government learn...
Salute to you sir
😭🙏
These are people who received the Covid vacinnes. They did not die from covid 19.  This is the lie that media is trying to past onto the world. In the U.S.A. 60% of hospital patients are the result of taking covid vaccines. The side affects has them in the hospital. They're reported as having covid 19 a lie. Wake up people do your research.
"Insaan nahi mar rahey insaniyat mar gye hai!" Ufff
How can you trust humanity
This is the way off corrupt people i dnt believe in ths news  i believe in God.
😓
It’s a bad job but somebody has to do it, much respect to the main man featured, it’s distressing under these circumstances, I hope the people of India can get through this 🙏
God bless you and your family Sardaarji.
印度政府无能
Turn to Allah people.Believe in La illAllah Muhammad dur Rasool Allah before it's to late.Every soul had to taste death just make sure you are ready and be patient with what ever Allah sends your way.Ameen
Guys this virus not only kill people but also destroys the environment because of the fire used in the crimation i will pray for you guys stay safe😷
"Even if we have to sell our homes." His kindness knows no bounds.
Those who want to donate , never donate to pm care fund. These modi government will never made it to reach to people instead they will use it for their own, so  search for an ngo and donate their if u want to .
Dear Hindus idol worshippers. Please start believing in one and only creator who created all of us and this universe and things that we see and things we don't see. Maybe this is the punishment for what you and your government did to those innocent people of Kashmir. This could be the time to repent and leave the life of shirk. May God guides all of us on the path of righteousness. Amen.
😭😭😭😭
This is western and Chinese propaganda trying to destroy India.
I am literally crying to see this video Sir you are such a great man  GOD bless you sir.🙏
Kashmir ko yad karo is wakat ma wo kasy roz roz marty hn
Very 😥.
:( praying for this man and his people 🙏🏼
Matter of fact- it is not covid that is killing people, it is the lack of treatment that is killing people.🙏🏾
🙏T🙏H🙏A🙏N🙏K🙏S🙏
Shukria jutenderji
If death rate will be so high n wood n places will be that short, then we might hv to seek other option like burying the bodies.
Much more respect to the covid warrior sardar ji and I appreciate the work of the team which brings the real ground reporting which we can't see in our so called media
He is a light in all this..  may god keep u safe
Cops live don’t matter
Hero
tzk tzk tzk tzk...  I can imagine the pictures of otherside of HELL that the people there are Burning with a massive Fire
yes seems life there is no value because of this virus.....may the Lord healed the land of india and forgive all the sins of people, amen!
God bless you Jitender. You are an amazing person. 👏
Propoganda!!!!!! They aren't dying from Covid! They are dying from starvation bc of the lockdowns!!! Framing is everything. This is messed up bc Biden is sending them oxygen when they need food! And Biden is sending them a failed vaccine that they wouldnt even use here!!!
I love the United States of America but after watching this I feel that even I take the U. S. for granted at times.
I wouldn't think twice about voting him as president of any current nation.
The last sentences he said 😢
When someone wears a Dastãr, this is the kind of humbleness and empathy it represents.
❤️👍🙏n best wishes Sardarji
God Bless the United States.
Is there a go-fund-me type of account setup for Jitender's organization? i think many people in the world would like to donate but doesn't know how... I am from Malaysia.
I don't believe that to be covid not with those mask that do nothing..everyone would be sick
Guaranteed that the government is doing this to them.
The ground workers, who lift and transport the bodies too deserve lots of support and appreciation!
IF you believe it was Covid.  Here in the U.S. heart attacks, strokes and motorcycle accidents are all listed as Covid deaths.
I feel sorry for you, Mr Singh, bless you and prayers to all those perished and affected, hope this is relieved soonest. 🙏🙏🙏
Paid actors to scare us into getting the vaccines.
Sardar should be the PM of India instead of Modi. Sardar jee is the real hearo. I see him in many vidoes, taking bodies without care of his own life threat from this cove 19. Sardar jee is true human and world required these kind of people. The whole world will be destroyed if we did not see people like Sardar jee..... Sardar jee, I am from Pakistan and really find no words to appreciate you but I am saying that what are doing, you are doing great work.
So Sad 😭 Father God Touch the people of India with your grace and mercy through this horrific pandemic" guide and direct the leaders to do what ever possible, bless the countries that sent emergency aid oxygen and supplies in this horrific event! Amen 🙏
Oh, I thought tht was Minneapolis
Hes a Good man God bless R.I.P to all that have passed away 🙏🏿🙌🏾❤😭
My heart grows heavy , god please help India
Rip
Do trump supporters still think the virus is a hoax?  If so, how do they explain what is happening in India.
can't believe there are 112 dislikes. this guy is an angel.
Where can we donate to Jetinder's cremation funds for the public?
Keep it up all the people who’ve been working so hard for the public.   We will past this situation together
If he does this through donations, is there a link we can share, please?
I really hope the U.S. and other allies can help India to overcome this tragedy. Air Force is sending oxygen but it's probably just a drop of water in the ocean.
And this started in China 🇨🇳 rember that
Great Hero 🙏
SA LAHAT NG MAKABASA NITO MORE BLESSINGS TO COME PO NOTHING IS IMPOSIBLE WITH GOD🙏❤️
🥲♥️💐
ok people of the future... before we hd Ww1, ww2, us we hd Covid19 and this is one of our  Hero Vets in the future..
He said kids?
Castism, superstition and bribe are the enemies of indian Public
IM SO SO SORRY MY HEART IS OVERWHELMED MY PRAYERS ARE FOR YOU ALL
My astrologer told me that Corona is mad at Modi because he insulted Corona by saying India has beaten the virus.
I dont mean to disreapect Indians. But im just wondering. Can't they just bury the dead? I mean. If they bury the them. They will not have to wait for many hrs. Burying the deceased will just have to take much shorter time compared to burning them. Right?   And also. Burning lots of dead body will contribute big time to air pollution.  But i guessed thats part of their tradition.  RIP to all the departed souls💔
You should be awarded with best civilian award sir ji. My eyes are teary.
Commendable. All Asian nations should put aside confrontation, stop the arm race with billions spent for jets, bombs, missiles, tanks, huge expenses for drills, and assuming the instigated non existence war games . Without people, without food, fighting is no meaning. Every ecosystem system will fail if the people distracted the democratically governments. Redeploy military assets, medical teams for the pandemic services and rescue. No one will invade your land with millions infected with COVID-19. The future of Asian is inter corporation, for humanity and survival. God bless India.
I salute the Sikh communities (gurdwaras, Khalsa aids, and all other organizations) who are serving humanity!
India needs  rational..scientific  temperamental   priminister ...! Not modi
Deeply hurt love one left continuously 💔💔
Dead bodies every where......unable to see.....we stand with Indians 🇵🇰
Sikh they stand tall then rest, grateful for selfless service. They are our Taj. thanks sardar ji.
Holy warrior.
Throw em in the ganges
Lord Jesus have mercy on us.
God on earth🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️
Allah reham frma
Sikhs are not in varna system, right? Hope he and his family can survive from this wave.
Please provide a way we could assist Jitender
Veerji no words for your efforts
I am Buddhism, we are the world, I pray for India people and all the world be safe from covid please All Lord Buddha help the world can get the wonder medicine for stop covid for all the world now with loving kindness to India and all aroud the world
Or karo Kashmir ka Lockdown.
India Has Many unsung heroes...Who are fighting this pandemic on their own without any help from the government...Like Javed khan of MP who's wife sold her gold so that her husband can ferry covid patients in his auto with oxygen supply in it ...That's why india is called a diverse country where everyone is helping one another irrespective of religion...God Bless Them🙏
Where is the Indian government
Modiji modiji modiji modiji modiji modiji modiji modiji modiji modiji modiji modiji modiji modiji modiji
This whole situation is not only shocking but disgraceful. Can’t believe how badly COVID has been handled in India. Was shocked by all the Festivals and Religious Ceremonies were being held with not care for Corona safety.  Amazes me how anyone is surprised by the massive Coronavirus cases in India. While all safe help should be given to India don’t believe we should risk our countries safety by opening the borders. After all, many sacrifices have been made here to ensure that safety. India could have done the same instead of being so reckless.
Who is this Akshay kumar talking, he can do advertising for this too... He can do for anything...
They burned the bodies openly it will cause air pollution 😱
No words...I only believe God is watching Jitender ji.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
🙏🙏🙏🙏
They should have the chinese out their doing that work that's where this mess started
Jitender ji appka a/c no gpay no bejo . Whatever possible will try doing
Sir you are doing something for which we are eternally greatful Not everyone can do this everyday. I wish the best of health for yourself and your family Thank you for your service You have helped many people meet god after their journey on this planet has ended
Shouldn't people be buried instead of burning them... Feels  unhuman
Dddddddd
Bhagat Singh aapko uoar Se dhua dete honge Bhaiji 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Joke of the Millennium- Sabka saath sabka vikas 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thank you sir  for nutting on the fires before you light them
Hats off to you sirji🙏🏻 ...May the departed soul be at peace.....most painful days...🙏🏻 may we all come out of this situation soon...God bless all
I have seen this man on the news every day of this past week. I know he's exhausted, frustrated, and heartbroken, yet he keeps going. He has my utmost respect.
Salute jitendar sir..
Salute to him 🙏 But why every foreign media channel is showing his account only there are thousands of people who are working day and night and plus there are many crematoriums please go there too.
24/7 constant LYING
Bless him🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺
after all some angels don’t have wings💞
You know what COVID came after 2 months of lockdown in Kashmir and still what Indian army doing in Kashmir . Whole world are in lockdown.   God bless us.  And forgive us 😢😢😢😢
I am American.   I don't know any Sikhs.   The ones that I see on the internet seem to be kind good people.  I have developed respect for them and wish them well.  I pray for all of India
Government failed to provide basic things like oxygen,beds,and other facility to people of India.They really failed to protect Indians.They knew this virus spreads,and India has huge population.. so they should have pre planned everything.But they arranged rallies.
Paji ❤️ 🙌 salute
Aayega toh Modi hi 😎😎😎

I Know it's Expensive, But in Times Like This, We Need a Lot of Robot Helpers while Humans Stay at Home and Give instructions the Robot helpers to do the work Outside. Who Knows If Something Bad Happen again or Worst?

Is it possible to donate money for buying wood directly?
The central government got 1 year for raw materials, supplies and essential for medical infrastructure and this happened again in 2021, Where is our health minister and our ultimate julmala Gobi Ji. This happens when people vote for religion & fake promises, at least now understand that educated leaders are important and we need someone educated to bring India back from these stupid leaders.

Immense respect to him💛 more power sir. From your neighbourhood 🇵🇰
This is hearting breaking, literally living hell.  Modi needs open his door wider than 180 degree to accept helps from all over the world.
Some glimmer of humanity. Respect sardarji❤️
Really good for the old global warming, lets burn people for a fake god.
THANK  YOU  CHINA  CHINA  NUMBA  WAN

These pains will be written in the History of India for sure.
i have watching this sikh man for working covid patients for last 2 years, he is true person who working for humanity , god bless you
Very well said sir.  There isn't humanity. Human being has no value.
Is it safe or sanitary doing cremation this way?.. Don't you think that the virus would disperse even more with these kind of open air cremation.. Your literally causing air pollution to add more to the problem people already now having a hard time breathing..
You are such a hero sir. Risking your own life. Working round the clock. I have nothing but respect for Mr Jitender. The scenes are really heartbreaking. So many families have been destroyed! Our leaders are complete insensitive to the suffering of their own people. All we can do is pray this is over soon. 🙏
If u want to save India just share the video , Indian mainstream media so called godi Media will never show this . Pray for us🙏
सिर्फ दिल्ली ही नहीं पुरा भारत कोरोना से लड़ रहा है😭🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
How do we donate??
Jitender Sir, you said Humanity is dying in your city. After seeing your social work there arose a deep sense of responsibility within me to work selflessly for the mankind.  The dedication and efforts of your entire team are beyond imagination.  |Hare Krishna|
We are not able to see the fate of our loved country people, rightfully they deserve a place in God's Home, our eyes are tearing down and our hearts are breaking down,we watch you all go up to God's Home Town ❤️ U all and miss you all ❤️
Mad Respect Sir🙏🙏
கொடுமை இதெல்லாம்
All these happen just because of human.....  God given chicken,  mutton and fish but ppl in china wants to eat all kinda foods. Food is to survive and not for greediness
Answer to the question is ,its Painful ,it's sorrow, it's hard to swallow tears, it's anger, it's despair... It's even more upsetting Because you know the ones responsible for this are going to get away Scot free
Люди поумирали не от ковида а от сделанной ранее прививки от ковида!

@insidernews I am interested in helping this man. Can you please provide contact or donation details in the video? Bravo for this kind of jurnalism: focusing on facts, not drama, and showing real people standing tall during the worst modern human disaster.
It is time for all people  to fight against communism to save the world The Communists are beginning to attack the world with Wuhancovid 19 . Those who allied themselves with communism were atheists.
more powers to the brave guy !!!!!!!!!!!!!
When the pandemic started I couldn't believe it was real, but here we are now and it's still unbelievable......
WHT you say about kashmir
Thanks Jitender Ji, I am feeling shame now
A big salute.. truly truly
The problem in india are the clean and good healthy behavior on people, any epidemic can ignite in such filty nation
Finally, it was just the common man for the common man who says even if I sell my home I will ensure wood for the pyre. Wake up India! Don't vote for any of these spineless politicians. Don't support any party. These are the true warriors.
I thank you my dear Jatender from all my heart. You are truly a real genuine human being, all people are created by our Lord were supposed to be like you. Humanity is failing with the selfishness and the hate but you are the successful example of the  loving and great humanity🌺 May God protect you and your family and heal India the beautiful🙏
GodBless him and his warriors Abundantly

I'm not so customed with India or Sikhs so I have to ask because I'm curious, what language is he speaking?
India is super rich and it will come out easily from this Problem. Pakistan is just Bhikari Country. Modi hey toe mumkin  hey.
Almighty God in heavrn, please have mercy on Yourchildren in India. Please stop the corona virus to claim more lives. ..in Jesus' name. Amen
this is so sad that man is right its not just people at are dying its humanity. truly hurts my heart watching this
Bio Weapon in operation pure people they killed in the name of depopulation.
I didn't know this... But he's been an MLA, now an MP from the BJP... And he's a Bharat Ratna awardee.  He's been doing things like this his whole life. I salute him.
Overpopulated country
The are not protecting them self.stop India flight for a year not we enter any country.
Good move Prime Minister Morris, stop those who can come here and Infested the whole Australia. They went down on their own will, now they can  stay there until India control that disaster.  Indian politicians have plenty money for space programs but don't have money to build a decent health care system.  They are so false against his own people.
Insaan mar rahe hai par insaanith bhi mar rahi uskey saath..what words from a great man!!
When COVID-19 first appeared I said if this gets a hold in India it will have devastating effects. A humanitarian crisis
all the beest
India is infected such vigorously that virus takes  away more than 10 lakh people a day ......and the official reports show that 1000 people were dying a day ........government of India is not at all serious about people's lives....
This is why there is no need to oppress any human being. May Allah grant everyone the grace to understand. Amen I am praying for all the people of India from Bangladesh....
THIS HAPPENED AFTER THEY FORCED THE VACCINE UPON THEM!!
A big big salute to Mr Jintender Singhji for his relentless  work for the people ' Humanity' !
Guys we Indians really want your support...... I urge from the dept of my heart to support us as much as possible... Please donate how much would be possible according to you... People are dying just because of shortage of oxygen 😭😭😭😭 please guys help us out and pray to Jesus to save our lives😭😭😭😭 please guys......
Please do not share the visual while agni is being given to the Chita. It's a devotional process. Show everything apart from it. Let the soul go to the journey peacefully. You might gain views from it but soul will not be in peace
Such a nice man, god like
Sikh pple are humble pple no doubt respect to him 🇦🇫😢. Ya Allah Swt Raheem on ur human and guide them that burning is unacceptable stop doing shirk India please you will go astray

It seems most Indians never use disposable mask they just use cloth and reuse it all the time
Hung modi .This culprit is responsible for mass murder and genocide.Unbearable human suffering
Plsss help this strong man also...Such a hero
Feel sad and disturb about people died ,forgive them But,he is Modi good in form 4 quad  for war games against another country. Now payback from god to do bad thing.

If they cut body into small pieces then it would burn quickly. 👻👻👻
Waiting oxygen : They have to take vitamin D3 : one dose of 100 000 ui now or one dose 200 000 ui now  + 4 pills of ivermectin if he s 60 kilogramms weight or 5 pills if 70 kilogramms for 5 days.( if the pill is 3mg ) + zinc + dexamethasone if they are at more than 5 days from symptoms They will improve in the day .

Please , say around you .
🙏 ॐ शांति
At least Indian neighbor Pakistan is lucky enough where Army monitors situation in country very closely and reacts immediately with power! If such govt was in Pakistan, Marshall Law would already been imposed! Govt should be for the people by the people!
Prayers🙏🙏🙏🙏
😢😢😢😢
Where are the pictures of dead in England or America. Such Shameless Vultures making money of dead people. You can report the data as much as you like but there’s no need of showing the burning bodies of someones loved ones.
The people working at the crematoria are jeopardizing their health !! Despite wearing masks they are constantly breathing in toxic fumes !! If they don't got Covid-19, they are very likely to suffer longterm effects later in life from breathing in all these fumes. India should find another way to cremate the dead !!
Zorbovotide
May the almighty lord jesus christ bless you abundantly with good health,happy long life and may he shower upon you with lots of wealth. Which you can continue the good work you have been doing for the humankind. ❤️🙏from Nagaland,India.
No offense but its times like these when tradition needs to go out the window, breathing in toxic fumes/smoke against a backdrop of background urban pollution in a pandemic that causes respiratory issues is probably making the problem worse, especially having so many people so close together.
Delhi people are facing Modi's grudge because they lost MCD election. Shame on BJP.
Маска тагып жүріңдер
@insult_Russia <-- Telegram 🙄
dont burn dead people GOD will stop punish.
Modi besharm tu nikal es desh se, GET OUT. Pm care fund es gawar chor ne bas bengal rally mai lagaye hai.
Thanks a lot Gentle man
Sikhs never ask for anything, they just help people quietly, they don't even say what they did to get any prize or anything, they give free food and they are helping lots of people during this pandemic for free, istg i aint even a sikh and all i can say is i don't think any religion can be kinder than sikhs
How do they stand the smell of those human bodies burning?
🙏🙏🙏🙏😭😭😭
One day we will all be judged on how much we have loved. This man is an example for all. So comforting knowing that he does what he does with love and respect... 🙏 for humanity!
Vaccine experiment 😭
A good Sikh is a good man. My father always said to me. 🙏🏼😢
God bless you
Very sad situation in India. Deeply condolences to all of humans in India & around the world. May Allah blessed all of you & rest of the world.
Media must condemn China for this crisis
Please save the trees and wood
O no.. Khalistani ye kya kar rha hai... Godiyon ko isi sivein mein fukk k mar jana chahiye...
All this happen due to cruelty on kashmir implemented by india
All this happen due to cruelty on kashmir implemented by india
In Meghalaya, India, they started ekectrocremation many years ago....no need for fire wood...all india must follow the Khasi people's example...
You people had made life difficult for the kashmiri and the muslims of India  now it's your turn to pay for your dreads. But we still pray for India May Allah end this pandemic in the India and in the whole world in general.
You are the real hero God bless you 🙏
What a load of bullshit. Try cremating a pig out in the open, after one day, the pig will still be intact. That is why we have cremation chambers, it takes more than a few pieces of wood to char a human body. This is all staged and fake news.
Please sab log ghar mein raho. Bahar mat niklo
Aap asli hero ho🙏🙏🙏🙏 sir
Amazing person....lost for words
People say this virus is just the flu. Look what it's doing in India, what 8t can do if we're not careful. This is what the virus can do. Please, for the sake of your loved ones, please take care.
corana been out a year..tf they been doing?
Salute 🙏
You can donate to them on their website..  SBSFOUNDATION_dot_ORG (Can't post direct link because the comment gets deleted) Also remember... Don't donate to any govt funds.. They'll use it for election rallies
Thanks a lot,
God bless you. Such people are few who help helpless with no financial consideration. Keep up your good job. All hearts are with you.
Ir0nic how india sc@m other countries and now they're seeking for help, guess that's called k@rm@.💯
Allah pak give them sabar
They're willing to sell their homes to have wood for the deceased? God bless them. This is love your neighbor to the max!
Don’t burn your loved one, it’s really cruel to burn your faimly members in fire , stop this please, come to the true path come to the islam and read Quran with translation, don’t worship idols or animals or any likeness, please just worship only one true GOD, Allah almighty,
Good work shanty Ji God bless u

When it comes to helping the nation, the sikh community are the frontline and they do it with a heavy heart. Much respect  from a fellow christian brother🙏🏻

Insider, where can we donate directly to his organization? Thank you
Sikh are always first to protect and save 🇮🇳India PM Modi must understand this...
Once again sikh people proved why they are above us
U are my hero
Gm please stop burning instead burry them and plant trees. If u plant trees will clear The air and atmosphere. U will be provided by clean oxygen. I am very sorry to see it. Please donot take my wrong.
Religions and their silly superstitions have no place in modern society.  So many of the world's problems would be solved or mitigated if religions ceased.  Stop believing that some invisible god or deity is protecting you.  Humans can only count on each other.
Think twice when you make joke on Sardar, they are life saver when all political parties nowhere exist on ground
100% sad
Only religion is left is Sikhism, other so called preachers should learn from it
We are pakistani.... We r with any human in the world...! Because corona..... Dukhat garhi...!
I bow respect to this real Human that lives the definition of it. 🙏💪
Abb kha gye khalistani bolne wale or funding ki jach krwane wale
Hands down an amazing man ❤️
Thank you Sardarji for your seva. Each and every moment of my life I have always seen Sikhs giving unconditional Seva to people without asking for favour. Thank you ji.
Can anyone start a gofundme to help? I’ve never started an account but I’d definitely help contribute if we could... if someone could.
We will 🙏
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 You’re doing the great job sir .. .. !!
Salute to u..Sardarji
He deserve national award for his selfless contribution to the society
Great work by this man and his team. Doing for free. No expectation. Pure work. Very few people exists like this. Rest of us work for personal gain.
Respect ur work sir n respect to ol the lost soul🙏m a christian n ive neva seen in real  burning the dead body....only in hindi movies i saw but now ohh my goodness feel sad to my brothr sister m frm northeast india RIP to ol the lost soul...may God console their families😔
Politics sucka
Sikhs are the pride of India! Salute to them.
Your very kind and faithful Mr. Jitender,,, God will protect you and your team☝️🙏
Singh is king such a brave man May Allah bless u n protect u il pray for u Uncle 😭💓Ya Allah sabpe reham farma maaf kardo Ya Allah 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Actual death toll is somewhere around 5-10 lakh people in india so far.
i am proud on our sikh brothers  respect form heart
What a strong Man! 😔 😒 🙄 😖 I see the sorrow in him and can't even imagine what his life is like right now! 💔 But it is people like him that show humanity does still exist, even in a Crisis like this! I pray for India 🇮🇳 and for the people like this Gentleman and his Team! 😔
paaji is an epitome of humanity,i practice Hinduism but this sardar jee is far above from any religion of THE WORLD.
Before i suffer like that id use a bike or car air compressor, nebulizer or even an outlet from a small shop vacuum with a filter of course there are many way to get forced oxygen without tanks I used my 20 dollar nebulizer when i caught covid without the mouth piece or a portable oxygen concentrator. Anything is better than nothing.
I was modi’s supporter for a long time, but now I’ll say that he is a murderer who don’t care about anyone’s life. He just cares about power.
Yes what you doing has no equal amount to pay ...but don't show the cremations...
He is someone deaerve Nobel prize
😔🙏
Respect the dead ...
Plz people don't show this ..all know ..but showing cremation and publicizing it you are disrespecting the dead souls..
My mother was a victim of Covid... When we heard that she got it... We knew that she had to fight very hard to stay alive because she was a diabetic with a weak immune system.. One of the saddest thing about this was that no one could visit her.. no one was by her side as she passed... I love you mom.
🥺 sikh ji god bless you
Modi is doing ok because India is the biggest democratic country in the world. Indian people have freedom and choices of doing anything they want, unlike China where people are not dying and living fine but are under authoritarian system. India despite many covid deaths will surpass China soon. Long live India!
Festivals were more important than protecting relatives.. They saw Brazil. This is a huge sacrafice that will change these mortician's for life
When the god (akaal purakh) itself orders then it is done not even death can challenge.Waheguru ji di meher hai twade te veerji tutna ni sikh ni tutde.
Your service to mankind is service to GOD Mr Jitender  may the great Almighty bestow  strength and good health upon you🙏
This is stupid journalism you are spreading so much negativity that people who get covid are dying of fear ...yes its unbearable  ..but putting live creation for trp you should be ashamed ...you can also show how many are recovering daily  ...stop this spread of negativity ....you are like vultures feeding on dead ....give them respect and peace
In my life time I want to meet my brother
Jitender my Bhai....I don't know how to thank you my brother 🙏🙏🙏🙏
It is so sad but look at all those smokes
People please pray for them, prayer is powerful
Insurance companies will be happy in cases where the deaths are not verified and documented properly. I believe there are many among the dead who have some kind of life insurance policies.
How can we help support his man , how do we donate to his cause ?
Where are those evil idiot politician who promises everything during elections ??? They should be in crematorium and helping this man...where are this f * cking idiots.
Who will be blamed for this virus?
Ek ground level p insaan itna kar skta hai to socho agar neta log insaniyat ka sochne lag jaye to...Ek ek neta 1000-2000 crore black money chupaye rehta h..Uske ek crore se hi kitne gareebo ka fayda ho jae...
Keep Safe to all and Pray. Im from Philippines and I just want to support in your prayers.
heads of jitender ji  God will help you
Pray For Delhi😢
in a world ruled by corrupt governments and the rich, the poor are left to die like sub-humans....when will this nightmare end?
Praying for all the families who have lost loved ones. 🙏❤️ May all the paramedics and ones helping during this devastating time stay healthy!  In the U.S., the government is pushing the “fact” that COVID doesn’t affect children. Apparently, only in India it does. 🤔
Another angel here to help at the cost of his own pain.  I can honestly say we share this pain with you sir and your country.  While Americans are so dying to go out and forget this all happened, they do not realize that this is not yet over.  We have 2 confirmed India variants here in America.  This,  im afraid will take alot of ppl but it is us who are to Blame for this.  Ppl don't frkn listen.  They think this a joke.  They need to wake up and fast.  SMH may God have mercy on those who are doing what they need to do to do the spread.
Very good reporting, thank you very much. Love n peace from Hong Kong which has a lot of Indian friends n Sikhs brothers. God bless everyone. May God has mercy on India.
God bless you sardar ji Allah India pe rehem kare
And then they r called traitors and defamed by modi and his itcell swinesss...
Only if kejriwal ji used the money given in December to built actual oxygen plants rather then diverting it in elections in UP.
Always remember whose negligence caused all this havoc. Who was organizing kumbh mela and elections during this time
Speechless
All that smoke is making people more suceptible to the pathogenesis of severe covid.
Sardar ji आप हो असली हिरो दिल से सलाम करता हूं 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲
Man with a heart of gold ❤️.

They must burried the dead bodies in the ground, to increase oxygen availability as combustion required lots of oxygen.
A good selfless soul. Good man

That’s some serious pollution your creating there.
Thank you jitendar ji 🙏🙏🙏 plz share how can people donate your crematory?
Really an angel in human form.
He is a HERO
Like this guy said at the end, we have reached the lowest point in humanity when people have to pay for oxygen when it should be available free of charge. It is bad enough being human, we have to pay for our existence no matter what race or where we are in this world starting with our birth certificate and all the way until death. We call our species superior and advanced when all other species in this world can exist freely.
Sir...you are doing greatest work of humanity...with selfless efforts... And you are saying right..that humanity has died to far more extent than human.. Highly appreciable for your work..❤❤❤😑😑😑😑
Where is patriotic RSS as$holes?
India repent! Stop worshipping idols. Worship the one TRUE God. His name is Jesus Christ. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Jesus is our ONLY Saviour and Healer. TRUST in the Lord Jesus with all your heart, mind, body, and soul.
This is india.. Have billions of dollars for weapon purchase for uts US masters, but do not have small amount for uplifting its citizens conditions.
does anybody know that the lock down in India is starving people to death. The dead are labeld covid victims and the show here was made for cover up? I heard this and I wouldn't be suprised the Kabal would do that
God bless him and his family... People like him are humanity representatives
This man should be awarded India's highest civilian award when this is all over....! And next time the poiticians try and take credit for the success, remember his name!
Noble service. Can't tell in words. Hats off
It looks like a Netflix trailer
I'm not sure but shyad MCD is runned by BJP (highest corporators for BJP)

Impact of globalization 😷🙏
I don't understand has any other time since covid any other countries dead has been shown this way? Were we seeing graveyards and open graves in Italy and US and dead bodies like this? This is journalism??
India and pakistan should regret every dollar they spent on their defence budget
Pure world k liye sikh ek kimti chiz hai jise hume sambhal k rakhna hai kyonki ye wo kom hai jinke andar sewa bhawna janm k saath janm leta hai.🙏🙏🙏🙏
This is painful....
Show this video to those who say ' ye corona vorona kuch nhi hai'
Please I can't donate. So please 🙏🙏 if you could donate, please do. He is willing to give his entire life for us anf donating for him is the least we could do.
Our Government has Majority fault in making COVID situation worse-   -When cases were rising, government was busy in election rallies and hiding corona cases.  -Corona has spread its leg for more than an year, but still government has failed to make adequate infrastructure despite doctors warning.  -Both in April 2020 and in November 2020, Niti Ayog warned PMO about future oxygen crisis. Till now more than thousand people have died not due to virus but due to shortage of oxygen. (FunFact- Kerela is only Oxygen surplus state)  -In last 1yr, Center government exported both 9,301MT oxygen and 6,63,00,000 Vial Remdesivir injection to other countries despite having shortage in their country.  -Due to Appeasement policy, government gave green light to Kumbh Mela Celebration which has 31lakh people crumbed into a small area.  -Despite this chaos, government is busy in its Propoganda.  - Doesn't have accountability of PM-CARES fund   - It has been found that government is fudging the cases and deaths report in UP, Gujrat and MP.  -UP government ordered labs not to test Corona.   Shortage of oxygen was exposed back in 2017, but government jailed the saviour Doctor. Now we all are getting the thorn which this government sowed.  Dictatorship going on in UP- "Take strict action under NSA & Seize the property of an individual who spreads rumours and propaganda on Oxygen shortage' in hospitals". YOGI
Real life super hero
The least the government can do is to supply them with wood
That’s what you get for breaking protocols, I’ll pray for 🇮🇳
There is hope for humanity Ji tunder is a beautiful soul 🙏🙏

These are the kind of people who should run for public offices rather than traditional politicians who just care bout votes. These people understand the common man problem and have the will to help.
They are insulted by anti-nationals and khalistanis by the government.....

So much air pollution
Humanity is dying, that's why humans are dying
Salute to u sir,
Still 87 goons of RSS disliking this video.
Thank you paji🙏🏼
The Indian government is severely under stating the deaths due to covid. 3k deaths is just the "official" number. Ground reports approximately say the number is 10 times more.
Hands up to him 👍 we are  praying for him and his family...
India govt is not to be trusted  Actual death count is over a million
🙏
These are the same Punjabi farmers, and muslims who were mocked and hated by whole india few months back because of farmers protest.
It's really hard to handle the chaos with such calmness. You are an inspiration to humanity sir. Respect
And that's why hardly anyone cares about the Oscars. These people don't even have oxygen.
4:15 “When such a basic thing as oxygen is not available, how can you trust humanity?”
very nobl soul ....jitendra ji🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Bare truth laid down by this gentleman. Salute to these people and many like him who are working 24×7 to help others.
May Allah bless you all for this service you are doing.

i wonder who issues the death certificates and the cause of death, right now i think, YOU COULD Murder someone in India, wrap the dead body up and send for Cremation under the guise of Covid-19 death and no one will even suspect a single thing, and just burn the body for you..
Jitender Ji people like you are like diamonds very rare to find. May god bless you 🙏
God will bless you
He is a human all people who are selling oxygen and medicines costly are devils ....cant say anything we deserve to die

Aayega to modi he kuch v ho
Hats off
It's not only covid-19 that is killing people in India, deaths r increasing, people r dying due to the unavailability of proper treatments. Hospitals overcrowded, lack of beds and oxygen r also responsible. N all that because of a foolish criminal pm who got time to celebrate victory over covid-19, busy doing political rallies bt never found it necessary to prepare for the next one.
Pray for India 🇮🇳 its sad to see that government does not help out in these NGO causes. Sad to see that hear that hospitals have no oxygen. Most hospitals on the news featuring are private hospitals imagine what must be happening in government hospitals. Poor people must be really suffering
Thank you for the hard work,   Right now I see it, in a very populated country like India, it's better to cremate bodies than to bury , getting space to bury people and traveling long miles to the village is a problem
I can trust humanity still because of people like him that are there on the front lines everyday.
I can't wait Durga puja celebration . India Will celebrate it yesss!!
U dont need wood to cremate dead bodies. If only India will have proper cremation out in the open. It will also eliminate pollution and can save more trees.
God please help INDIA in this tough situation. I pray for India and all the people.   I stand by a small prayer this morning from New York.
I'm going to pray for all of you Jesus name I pray amen
Hats off to you.. who is atleast making death respectful for people.. god bless you and your family.. 🙏 you are equivalent to god..
Peace and love to you sir! Thanks for being a caring soul 💖
Jitender Ji agr apke jese log humari sarkar me ho, to desh ka bhalla ho jae.  Modi Ji dekh lo app....

There is so much of pain around right now that we dont know how to contain it.. god have mercy on little children and their parents.. pls dont make them orphans and no parents should see their little one die for its the greatest pain ever.... please bless everyone with life almighty 🙏
I salute all first responders around the world!!! I salute healthcare professionals around the world!!! We need to have a special day for the first responders and healthcare professionals around the world!!!  My heart goes to India 🇮🇳 and around the world 🌍!!!

They are the richest and the poorest Nation on Earth heavily populated wet markets Etc filthy just like China except China has futuristic buildings and they dress nicer

Actual toll could be above 20lakhs, government suppressing the numbers
God bless Mr.Singh
😭😭😭😭😭 omg nooooo im so so sorry my heartbreaking  RIP
Man let me know if I am not thinking on the right lines . I firmly believe Humans thoroughly deserve this. It could be you, it could be me, all of us humans deserve this. Look at what we have done to the earth. Millions of species have met extinction and million others species will probably go extinct. We have made this earth our own. We have totally disregarded the existence of other animals. We have cut far deep into the wild. We have messed up Air water and soil. Human life isn't any more significant than any other wild animal.
Award to Modi hi lega , konsa pata nahi 😂😂😂
Beyond heartbroken watching this video😢😭.My prayers goes out to the families who have lost their loved ones..🙏🙏
Allah ham sab Pakistan aur India k logon ko is bemari say bachaye
India me aloha Ka azab h ye me Pakistani Jon our insanity k Nate dua go hon k alha. Pak apna khas kram Kare India per llekin ap log un ko dafnaiye tab ye azab tale ga
So tragic to see people of India suffering this way. May god give them strength to face this challenge.
Sir how can I donate to you ??
They are the Universal person who have a kindred humatarian thought of we belong to earth , Earth doesn't belong to us.
Somany trees 🌲 cut for this purpose
Thx Joe Rogan.
Salute  🇵🇰🇮🇳
only God can  saved us from all of this have mercy on us God 😔
Sardar ji is equal to god,,a man with golden heart....he shuld be given barath ratna for his services
God bless you Sir,  God is within you
Jitenda Ji, you are Super Hero. What an important task / role you are undertaking in this troubled times.   What would the vulnerable people do without your assistance.  You and your team are Angels in disguise.  May God Bless you.
How to contact them? I would like to donate my portion to the society
from india are such lovely people they are targeting the most populated countries, e.g china, india
My thoughts and prayers are with India ❤️
Don't fire 🔥 bodies it will cause dangerous air pollution
all channels are showing hindus dying...
Personally, open air cremation is too morbid for me. I witness one of such ceremony in bali (ngaben ceremony ) and when they burned the bodies, you gonna smell the smell of grilled meat but you then realized the smell is coming from the burned bodies.
Salute you sir
Thank you Jitender Ji 🙏
Very recently this Sardar's community was called terrorists and khalistanis.
Hats off to a human being. Jitendra ji.... Delhi thanks you. India thanks you
They started gathering with friends too early. Going to festivals and not wearing masks.
Sardarji bhagwan apko lambi umaar de......🌞
😪😪😪😪🙏
Indian governments play so tough with the Chinese government why Indian can not handle the covid19.  Only China can help your people.
I want to donate for his foundation, can somebody provide me the link?
God bless him.🙏
And the sad thing is instead of managing this grim situation,our government is vehemently trying to manage the narrative
I salute you sir. I salute you. Burning bodies is a horrific sight to see. Sending your loved ones like this is such a heart breaking sight to see. I myself is a daughter. I can never even imagine myself in such state. The disappointment, anger, guilt and grief the girl had... Ohh.. What kind of world now we lives in... Allah please have mercy. Please have mercy. Lots of love and prayers from Pakistan.
My hear goes out to you. May waheguruji bless you.
Guaranteed Let The Kashmiris have their own freedom that's the only vaccine will cure the covid
God bless you and your family.

Great Work Sardarji, No matter how much you try to hate this community for whatever reason their helpfulness alone can make you their fan 🙏
AZAB akibat membongkar masjid dan menindas orang Muslim..

Salute
Not every hero wears a cape ❤️... Thank you so much for giving and risking your everything 🙏
INDIAN PM IS AN IDIOT HE JUST WANT VOTES HE WAS BUSY IN ELECTION RALLIES 8-10  LAKH PEOPLE GATHERING I JUST WANT MODI RESIGNATION 😠😡🤬
And china government decided to silence doctors trying to warn us about the virus.  now they're scratching their heads wondering why they're getting blamed for this outbreak. 🙄
So sad 😞

Seriously they all deserve a big salute...but we all should do something from our part to help others in this covid crisis......
Covid is really cleaning india of it's large population
This man is a national treasure, the hero we need, but don't deserve.
Supreme leader has failed my country....sold out media & ignorant govt. Is responsible for this🤬🤬🤬
Salute to you!!
Such a wonderful man & his team doing an extremely difficult job especially during the world wide Pandemic. Surely he is classified as an earth angel along with a host of angels on his team. God bless him, I pray for all of India in such dire circumstances. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
May God  bless this pure soul whose helping  so many people's   selflessly.
More proof of incompetence by Modi and his hired idiots as more bodies are stacked up under the watch of Modi.
John 11:25-27 Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?" Yes, Lord," she replied, "I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, who is to come into the world."
Thanks for your service
Remember the Chinese Government is responsible for this.
Whatever People government brought to throw stones on farmers .Government again should bring those people to care citizens..now check their nationalism.
We've all delt with our fair share of this pandemic, the US and Italy both went through this wave where many have died and things looked grim but there is light on the other side of the rainbow and this too shall pass.
सरदार जी आप और आपके साथी की सुरक्षा की प्रार्थना करता हूं।। और एक हृदय से इक्षा है कि आपसे मिलु ।।।🙏🙏🙏
kok dibakar begitu ya, baunya pasti kyk sate, klo islam lbh manusiawi mayat dikuburkan.
I heard things were "bad" with covid-19 in India.  I didn't realize HOW bad.
Living god
Imagine the smell, yuk
Thanks China for the Virus.
I want to donate a small sum of Rs. 10,000 to this person. Where can I send it? I would appreciate help in this regard. I am in the USA.
Have you enough courage to show graveyard in USA. Hell no, but you show undeveloped  countries in such a bad tone. A satisfaction is seen in your reporting while indian corona situation is still better than america where more than  5 lakh people die in absence of treatment . If you care about us then at least do good reporting of us don't take pleasure of our pain . Shamefully vulture journalism
Huge respect to all the helper ,doctor ,nurses n all the social worker during the pandemic. Pray for India.
Salute to you sir. Love and blessings from Nepal 🇳🇵. 🙏🙏
We voted for them .may be Modi may be Kejriwal. both are same
PM has to resign for his failures in getting Ache din to people of India and not delivering his duty and promises he made before he came to power in Centre. Godhi Media has to be stopped else it will be the failure of Democracy / President Rule should be applied - This is an emergency in the nation / Supreeme court should take control of the Government mis deeds. Online News is the best because real people real comments.
Please 🥺 follow what is safe... 😞😢..  REST IN PIECE 😭😭😭😭.. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😞
Full respect sir.... salute
Sikhs have big heart in term  of showing humanity which is 100% true humanity.
'according to hindu tradition' Yeah reporting deaths is okay, reporting about the fact that deaths are severely underreported is also okay but these ceremonies are extremely private and are not to be used for YouTube ad money.
Politicians and Diapers are always need to be changed frequently,  And for the same reason.
👏👏
The air has to stink either from burning Flesh and rotting bodies. Why can't they under a one time ruling dig a large deep trench, line it with firewood, line up the dead then put more wood and do many as one .
This was so hard to watch. I started to cry. Bless this man and I thank him for his hardwork. I wish you guys provided a link to donate. God bless.
Bemaut koi nahi marta Sardaar ji.
Great Job Sir. God Bless You and Protect you. God will surely bless you and reward you for this noble cause in these difficult times🙏
Why didn't they tell us how we could donate to him
Pray of india
इस बुरे दौर में भगवान हो आप
This is so very heartbreaking. To think this could have been stopped over a year ago in Wuhan........ But noooo everyone has to travel, has to get on a plane and help save lives. Its a sick, selfish, self-indulgent world we live in. STAY HOME unless necessary to get absolute necessities.
How can we contact him?
Godi media wont show this
these news channels are paying in multitude of thousands for images of pyres and crematoriums. Vulture media at its absolute best.
Thanks a lot sir ji. Aap jaise logon ki wajah se hii aaj insaniyat thodi jinda hai. 🙏
I am from  Meghalaya one of the state in North East India, even though here in our state the covid cases are low, it's really heartbreaking to see the people of the other worst infected states struggling to find even the basic needs of covid patients 😭😭. I really hope this will end soon 😭😭.
Must think of Indian government has done in Kashmir. People of India remained silent why they must now speak against the violence by Indian government.
Sardarji : "Me tutne wala nagi hu"   Wah!!!!
Does anyone know where do donate to this guy who’s cremating loved ones for free?
May god bless his beautiful heart 💛
Oh my God, God always with us
The creamatorium in Delhi is receiving more dead bodies than is being stated in government reports. Something is very wrong here.
Sikhs are the bravest and biggest hearted people I ever know.  thank u sardar ji.
Good people like this paaji is keeping India float. May God bless you, your workers and all your families.
It's not the religion, that inspires faith. It's people like them who do.
I can’t imagine having this job. Respect.
Salute to ji
All we pray is He and the warriors are safe too!!❤️ Such selfless love❤️, May all souls who went through this torment rest in peace😔
Huge respect to him for being humble and helpful
🙏
Bankrupt Government is not counting the dead to avoid paying compensation to survivors.
Prayers for India... God please help these people. Let’s send some vaccines their way.
I am so confused whether to like or dislike this video. It's a very bad condition in indian . Pa hi you are such an amazing person
Him and his team are heros. God bless them and keep them safe & strong.
Respact sir... 🙏
Heart bleeds looking at this... Can never imagine a loved one in this situation.. Guys even if govt imposes lockdown Or not please stay at home and take care of urself and ur family..no body can bring dead one back..
No disrespect but what is the meaning of putting red flowers on top of the dead? Thanks
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE SUED..... n penalised to the last extent...,. my deepest condolences....
Everyone stay strong. My father is volunteering in RSS radhasoami centre. He is in charge of food department. Many people are crying and have their lives on risk. Many die in sleep and never meet their loved ones again. Please please stay inside.
Salute to such a Sikh 🙏🙏🙏
Praying for the people of India.
Its probably very hot
This is wut happens when everyone is religious , always looking back...and not the future!
The devil is the deceiver people don't buy into this fake propaganda
Sikhs help hindus with cremation?
Bless this man
G-d bless this man. A true warrior for humanity.
He is god in the form of man, But some are monster 👹 in the form of man.
What a say at last
Please learn from this next time when you vote picked a good one not the asshole like this people life is priceless not like this
My prayers to all those suffering in these hard times. May god help to heal the sick and give them strength to fight this disease. A big thank you to all who are helping people in any or every way 🙏🏼🙏🏼. This is a very big crisis, i hope the govt learns a lesson to spend money constructively on the welfare of common people rather than building tallest statues, as these statues are just standing numb and witnessing hundreds dying every day.
Just want to tell people here that 3000 is just the reported number otherwise the real numbers of death in a single day is beyond anyone's imagination.. I saw 200+ ambulances carrying bodies at a single cremation ground and that city had 3 in total cremation grounds and those deployed thier told that these lines are endless the whole day.. So imagine the number of deaths that happen each day.. There's an average waiting of at least 10-12 hours at these grounds given that you bring the body along with you if seeking the token for cremation.. In India right now we are witnessing what's it's like to live in hell..
1:12, is no one going to mention that the ambulance has a sporty flat-bottom steering wheel?
I bow to this noble gentleman for his service. It is deeply depressing.
Aye , be pissed at China 🇨🇳 /ccp
How can you have oxygen in Delhi when the burning pyre took all the earth oxygen ? Can you think of that the oxygen is needed for cremation for fire to lit .. where you want to get oxygen from earth ?
Allah says in the Quran: 'Everyone shall taste death. And only on the Day of Resurrection shall you be paid your wages in full. And whoever is removed away from the Fire and admitted to paradise, he indeed is successful. The life of this world is only the enjoyment of deception(a deceiving thing).' (S.3, v.185)  Every person who passes through the life of this world shall experience death-or a cessation to this life. Just as the birth, or the entrance into this life, and the continuance of our lives in the succession of days are all part of life, so death is also part of life. For without death as the exit from the life of this world, there is no progression towards the ultimate eternity.
Absolutely disgusting. You can't even honor the dead? You have to burn them?
सच कह रहे है आप अब इंसानियत मरती जा रही है भगवान आपको साहस और स्वास्थ दे यही मेरी प्रार्थना है
Please tell us how to donate!
Imagine seeing dead bodies everyday and burn them. This is a nightmare already. I Hope other indians are safe there
这么热的天气，遗体不能马上火花，尸水流出来的病毒不是造成二次传染吗？？？？
That has to stink horribly
Its sad when people are hyped on donating to gorillaglue girl but not for this selfless man
Salute sardarji 🙏
The mortality rate is extremely low. The news makes it out to be as if everybody is dropping like flies. Of course I have compassion for these people but I also understand the truth behind the curtains
You should become a CM you deserve it... Nation needs like you... Salute you.. Thank you so much
What a brave man, while most of us are at our homes. This person is out there giving a humble passage to the dead.
Indian government is of no use.
People are dying in hospitals due to shortage of medicines/ staff/ oxygen and others outside hospitals.3 members of my family also included in this disaster.Hats off to this system which doesn't understand emergency situation.
That Sikh man is angel in the form of human🙏🙏
In india it's a civil war condition . Indian government mismanagement is RESPONSIBLE
What sardarji doing can't be expressed in words. Emotional. He is right, not humans but humanity has died
God bless u paaji.. There are other ppl selling oxygen in black marketing.. Shame on those ppl
a minor correction : its  not just hindus , all four indian religions use cremation as the primary method for disposing of the  dead .
It's heartbreaking to see India bleeding 😔👍
No one saves and die themselves
How to donate money for these NGO's ...any link
Sikho ke paas jigra dekh liya aj mene 😞😞
PMcares for their own care
Please give this great man an award! We should support munificent people like him. Hats off!

It's tragic that people r dying for lack of oxygen , unlike food this was a basic need always met free by nature. In this pandemic oxygen cylinders even when available cost a fortune and covid victims r suffocating to death.
Best medicine for long term gain  Sleep  Diet  Light exercise  Deep breathing(pranyama)  Sunlight  Spread love and care for others- I know it sounds  non profitable but always keep a happy vibe
We dont want to look ...you people have gone too bad 😞... You people Have no shame
sikh tradition as well
And they still allow religious gatherings to happen smh

U made me into tears I don't know what to say

True hero

Dat ke sardaran
So pathetic, heart crushing,  "thank u" has no value for this gentleman n the volunteers,  Almighty help them
This is my worst nightmare, I can't imagine.... That someone's loved one, first didn't got treatment of the living and now isn't getting treatment of the dead... It's pure anarchy here, all this while our souldead and braindead 'leaders' keep claiming an oxygen surplus in their air conditioned room.
Salute sir
well when you poop and bathe in the same water a outbreak was bound to be deadly
Request you to please put the donation link with the description as well so that the willing viewers can donate to the noble cause.
HIN DUZ should get forgiveness from Àllah if they want mercy. HIN DUZ are writing abusing comments against Islam.  HIN DUZ are killing INNO cents Muslim in KASH MIR and  India.
God bless India and the world 🙏🏼🖤
Of course the burial  i free.
Great job👏👍
"Then how can you trust humanity?"

India going to be like Europe during Black Plague
Misery porn for the west  - In the United States its illegal to show or film patients due to HIPAA laws that come with heavy penalties. These scenes are no different than what happened in NY last year
Stay safe sir!
Turn your life to the Mighty Lord Jesus Christ He will save you. Accept Him and call Him.
Students looking for jobs are asked about competency. What about government.
Hats off sir...  Thousands salutes to you..

Sardar Sahb. Salute aa tohnu. Parmatma tohnu chrdhikala bkshe
Dhandha full swing main hai 😂😂
Hats off sir!! Our Salute to you and your team
May Allah give strength to this wonderful man and people like him.
It is no doubt a difficult job to undertake especially during times where some relatives have abandoned loved ones.  I'm a Muslim so don't believe in cremation,  but everyone has their own beliefs and it should be respected
God please sent help to India, may God have mercy for India. 🙏
Why didn't you give us donation link in the discription box?
Sikhs have been at the forefront in India....be it saving .....other communities.....cage guruji da khalsa ......
I am from the United States hello India I am praying for you all my friends and I hope the United States hurries and helps you all with vaccines I just wish they would show this on our news over in the United States cuz they do not show the people this if we did see this everyday on our news outlets the American people would start telling our government to help Indian people I just have one question watching this video own the way y'all do funerals with the body or what ever you call it cuz I don't know why do y'all burn the bodies with all them trees when we could just put our bodies in the ground cover it with dirt and then plant trees on top of it once the graveyard is full I believe that would make a beautiful Forest cuz I wish we would do that to in the United States we do put them in the ground what day are in a big casket and that is just making wasted space because they have cement on top Underground big like the casket in my body was in the ground I would want a tree planted right over me cuz maybe my spirit would grow in that tree and it would be a beautiful tree because it would be getting nutrients from my body and bones that's my thought it would help the world cuz God knows the world needs it now and it don't need the way we do funerals cuz I believe we're doing it wrong just my opinion let me know why y'all do y'all like that thanks your friend

taab insaniyat yaad nahi aye jab india ma musalmano pa zulum ho raha tha aur musalmano ko jaan sa mara jaa raha tha tab kaha gaye the insaniyat ek bhi hindu ka muu nahi khula tha tab
As long as the virus is out there , no one is safe. This may be the beginning of the second wave that could impact the whole world. Countries with money & power should do more to help Indians. You don't want to lose a strategic ally to China do you america.
Humanity is fine— good people everywhere.... It’s your government and f’d up antiquated caste system that is the problem
You have a good heart, thank you sir

Failure of A Nation politicians.
People will start living in Mars now, rather than living on this planet called Earth...
This breaks my heart. I wonder what it smells like to be there cremating those dead bodies
Real hero.
He probably voted for Modi. Now the chickens are coming home to roost. Poor guy, I hope the pandemic in India ends soon.
Very sad
Thank you for reporting
He is a true hero!!!  And all the others who are working with him!!!  What an amazing man!!!
