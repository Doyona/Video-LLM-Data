Tbh in my opinion the argument between the two of debating who is bigger they both wrong in certain arguments and I'm a man united fan ATM I feel Man City is bigger now especially considering they won the UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE title and Arsenal were bigger in the past but currently I wouldn't say they are now like Man city is a bigger club now but it's not by much in my opinion is that fair or can someone object my comment?
Deluded Arsenal fans are the best 😂😂
City has very little history
17:46
3:33 dear arsenal fans its time to accept that you guys are not the best club in london .
Is this the video where the arsenal guy  was pronounced dead ?
City fans don’t want to be invincible. Arsenal fans desperately want city fans to want to be invincible. And it annoys them that they or anyone else is not bothered about being invincible
Robbie is too cold 🥶
1:58 Robbie that was jokes 😂😂😂😂
Tell him Robbie.
It’s funny because city in 21/22 were better than the invincibles 93 points to 90
Man city fans exist?
3 years on this is hilarious
Can’t stand this Steve….. met many horrible fans like him and that all of a sudden smugness ….
Big Steve is one of my favourite people on SB … what a chill guy
115…
The history argument is the weakest argument to use
"History FC" 🤣
Robbie with the "oh a city fan... Ive found one" haha was perfect and so true haha city fans only started showing up since 2013 😂😂
Aged well for Robbie 😂.   Aaron Ramsdale sold to saints.  Smith-Rowe gone to Fulham, whilst Jack keeps adding winners medal to the collection.
Robbie talks out his back side
"we didn't buy it, we bought wisely" still bought didn't you?
Clear win for Big Steve.. Left Robbie bamboozled with FACTS 🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆
Man city bought their trophies. City fan strongly disagree. That's when I turned vid off. Before they were moneybags they were a championship side. No money, no trophies. 99.9999999% of proper football fans will agree with that, even moneybags fans. Just as deluded as the red side of Manchester, he should be a United fan
Yep, that's why he's gone to Fulham then 😂😂😂
Arsenal is not that big brother 😂😂😂 the biggest clubs are Real madrid ac milan bayern liverpool barcelona man united that's it ( and city are bigger than arsenal now in my opinion)
Watching this video back makes Robbie look even more stupid then he was then .
Literally ANYONE is better than grealish 😭😭😭
Smith - Rowe over Grealish ok then
The delusion that is Robbie 😂
It’s always great to come back and watch Robbie’s terrible takes🤣 the 2 players he said would get in the city team are now the sub keeper at arsenal and a fulham player
Borehamwood are a bigger club as Arsenal (totally not biased as a BWOOD fan)
Grealish is an average player and even though he plays with WC players like DEbryne,Dias,Rodri and Haaland ,his numbers are still very average
Smithy Rowe gone to Fulham he was that good 😅
This aged well, what happened to smith rowe?
City has similar worldwide fans as Arsenal and has spent less money the past 10 years
“We have just turn up and win more Premier League trophies than you” End of discussion
Guys can I ask why arsenal fans are so deluded fck?
City has the fakest fans of all time lmao most of them just turned for a few years ago when they started winning 😂
This aged horribly for arsrnal fans 😂  lets have this discussion now
Champions again... Yes mate!  Big club again... Yes mate!  😂😂😂😂😂😂
Harder to go invincible in any league lower down the British pyramid than the top flight
Cole Palmer is better than Smith-Rowe
Smith Rowe isn't better than bowen let alone grealish lol
The fact Robbie picks smith rowe from Arsenal then asks who they have in that position is incredible he’s done it before on another one 😂😂
The old Skool earned those trophies. It took a lot of dark humour to get through those days. It paid off.
Still doesn't change the fact that city never  climbed the proper way to the top. Mr Oil money sheikh bought them, some great players and managers wanted the money and here we are. No honor in that. And it never should have been legal.
Entire video aged very well after the treble 🩵🩵🩵
The man city hit the nail on the head when he said imagine being 15th in league two. That's what city are a small club ran through cheating oil money. 115 breaches of ffp come down to take them out no smoke without fire
ManU and arsenal are the only 2 clubs to make football what it is today.
2 years later and city is the bigger club in 2024
i actually really like this guy as a united fan
Centurions is a miles better achievement than the invincibles 🤷🏻‍♂️ Arsenal won 26, drew 12, lost 0… Man City won 32, drew 4, lost 2 👍🏻 as he said, you draw all 38 then you’re invincible but you’re also more than likely relegated
As if he said Smith Rowe 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Arsenal champions leagues: 0 Man city champions leagues: 1
Being invisible is irrelevant when you draw half the games. It’s not that impressive.
Robbie got rubbed out here😂😂😂
I thought only ty was overly deluded, but this video proved theyre all deluded
"115 charges" bastards.
I'm a Gooner. ESR is different gear, being mugged off by Arteta atm, but BETTER than Grealish? Leave off!!
both are overrated
4:06 2 years late but Arsenal bought themselves into the league Got a huge investment in the 90s we also had won 5 trophies before arsenal won their first 😂😂
Big Steve is right, you can be invincible and get relegated lol
Delusional Arsenal fan
This aged well 😂 MCFC! 5 in one season 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
literally just saw this guy on live tv in saudi arabia watching manchester city play the club world cup dedicated fan.
That’s awsome and respect to the guy and he’s a proper supporter.   That’s why he must be gutted when he knows he’s club been handed 115 charges of cheating. That’s not normal and his clubs reaction towards the charges isn’t good either. Doing everything in their power not to cooperate isn’t a good sign.   The total disrespect from them owners towards proper fans are insane 😕 Succes isn’t worth anything if it’s built on a lie.
How is a man who supports a club who has never won a champions league talking so tough lmao delusion
alisson was 65 😂
Smith Rowe is better than grealish - city fan
White and black fat guys debating over a   s hit a ss club
As a football I want to see Arsenal win big, but fans like Robbie, make it hard for me to cheer for the Gunners.
The invincible trophy is small because it's gold not silver....
The other big teams need to stop talking about history. City have history but it wasnt as glorious as theres, but were creating more history at the moment. When pep leaves, we'll settle down a bit but we've been flying high and still are. Show somw respect
city are the better team hands down
Grealish helped win a treble. Smith rowe can’t get into the arsenal squad 😂
It’s true all Arsenal fans have left is the 03/04 season
Man City sold every single ticket for every single scheduled game in a single day  It’s Only because the old system required fans to wait until very close to the game that games didn’t sell completely but that changed and then they sold every ticket in a day
Manchester City have a lot of history
ESR is finished now no one cares about him
Smith Rowe better than grealish😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂chubby brown
In my opinion Aron could be 1st choicel
Arsenal fans were born with the crack pipe crackling
Please redo the interview once again now
Robbie putting disagree instead of strongly disagree means he agrees 😂
this didnt age well😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😃
Yet Man City won European title before Arsenal😂😂😂
Let’s run this debate back @LADbible
They go robbie 'big club again and i say yes man'!   That made me burst!! HAHAH!!
Get them both on now with city winning the trebble
Spurs may gave won nothing, best stadium tho right now, here
Sweet
Everyone's passionate
Who is this man u? Loved them now I'm fucking pissed of with them after hearing you
Loyal people don't bullshit
Should never gave changed that back once it said far
we have to have this again , after the treble
Why are fans bothered about how big their club is 🥱
The notion that city don't have a history is embarrasing
3:00 man city has a full stadium 😂
steve destroyed him 😂 hopefully man city go invincible so he can stfu about that overrated team
Aaron ramsdale over ederson 😂😂😂
Who the fuck are the centurions
here after city won the treble and is now a bigger club
Man City is building the future and im telling you the kids growing up now are city fans most of them
this is even sweeter now after the season City had...    : )
Explain the 2 billion we spent on players ?????
When was the last time you won the league or even got near it!!!! All your fans got everything wrong, remember use are only where you are because you was given Arteta and he copied how city play !!!!!
You probably think tony adams is better than Dias !!!!
Smith Rowe gets in city’s ream before , Grealish, Silva , foden , Marhrez Alvarez 😂😂😂😂😂😂
How did we buy the league was it in 2010 or sumat when we signed  lescott ????
Blackpool  must be a big club and Preston??? Rowe better than grealish 😂😂😂❤️ and this comment  was after 6 minutes 😂😂😂😂 you don’t know shit about football no Arsenal fan does you clowns !!!
Invincible team - overated great team for sure but the points total definitely most relevant.   Man city already a bigger team than arsenal. Only pool and manure are bigger than man city now
Smith-Rowe over treble winner Jack Grealish….Arsenal fans are the most delusional fans ever….was gonna say born, but they arrive on these shores and take up who has the biggest YT views. 😂
How beautifully has the title aged😂 arsenal fans deserve every bit of this pain
Treble life a year later I want this debate agian😂
humpty dumpty and samuel XL jackson should go play some football and go for a jog instead of drinking beer and arguing over teams and players that don’t give a shit about them 🤣
"Manchester City will never be as big a club as Arsenal" - Accomplished in 10/06/2023.
Can we run this video again after our treble win💪🏼
Seeing Robbie compare jack to ems after the treble is so funny 😂
City just became bigger. 🤣🤣
HERE AFTER THE TREBLE💙💙💙
Bottlers always talks about invicibles
We literally have more fans worldwide than Arsenal. We're more worth than them.  We're winning trophies - And lots of them. And this is in the current time. Not 20-30 years ago. We have the best team in the world rn and we have the single best manager who have ever lived imo. And btw Robbie. We have more fans than United in and around Manchester. We're the Citys club. That took approximately 1 minute to google. But yeah, you're the big club 👍  Big L Rob. Only other deluded Arsenal fans would agree with you.
This Robbie guy actually makes you be happy that Arsenal didn’t win. Fickle. Over his history on the fan channel it flip flops from sack the coach/keep the coach etc.
and yet still city champion this season funny smithrow not even close to grealish
The afc fan  lol  what a prat
The Grealish talks aged like milk😂
Man City defeating Real Madrid 4-0 and if they ein champions league the question will be answered
bro said City had the highest points tally in english football 😭😭
Ramsdale over ederson. Bruv💀
Look at don  robbeh trying to force smith rowe into citys lineup then they went and got city bench players and he couldnt even get off their bench
Would love for them to re do this video after this season. First question did arsenal bottle the league?
am a city fan but am not a city fan like big steve he seen it all and with that i give you my respect
Man City journey 😢🩵🙌
1:50 Can’t lie Robbie got him bad 😂😂😂😂     Edit:   2:34 And he got him right back 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Whatever happen to Smith Rowe? Grealish meanwhile… 🏆
Man City these days are a bigger and more recognised club around the world then arsenal and that’s a fact
I can confirm as a Arsenal fan. Emile Smith Rowe is not better than Jack Grealish.
This arsenal fan would say anything to get the clicks . We all know that by now😂😂
Lol “don” Robbie
One year later and Arsenal fans are leaving in droves at the Emirates after being smashed 3 0 by Brighton and seeing their chances of a league title going up in smoke
this aged well
Big Steve legend! MCFC 🔝
the word Never is a pointless statement / question , no one knows what the future holds and if we go back 100 years look who was top dogs and nobodies and where they are now
Win titles by winning games (most points) city have most points in English football history in a season
Smith Rowe over any city player is wild
I'm a massive gooner but I'm not stupid city If they carry on winning titles over the next ten years and not just fa Cups and league cups I'm talking another five or six league titles then they will have every right to talk about being one of the biggest clubs in the premier league I hate to say it but you can't make history without winning the big time titles and city are doing regardless of the money income they have had they are still winning major titles it's legal it's history but what I've seen in the past three seasons from arteta is that he can attract the right players and top players while being backed with top funds and can get a young team playing great football and from what I've been witnessesing to over the last two to 3 seasons is arteta knows what he's doing with top players this time next season I believe he will be a premier league winning coach and I don't care what anyone else thinks I do not see arsenal getting any weaker but only getting stronger than they are next season it is all exciting but arsenal right now are definitely bigger than city and I pray arsenal keep it that way this season or next
I wanna see this between barca and real Madrid.
That Grealish debate aged well
Aaron Ramsdale 😂😂
Steve is proply the most awesome footballfan in the world. Seriously.. How easy would it be to be a United fan in the 90s? But stand behind his small team City and now gets the all the benefits of staying true and loyal.
Robbie is such a goofball
The grealish disrespect aged well 👌🏾
Unless they have a beer on the side these two guys are showing inhuman willpower
Ouch.
Robbie is delusional
Just seeing this. City fan killed him😂. Sorry but it's not easy to banter teams that are winning and dominant. Best bide your time because these things are cyclical and I don't know who would prefer to be part of a large fan base watching their team lose v a small set enjoying winning
Arsenal are 💩
Dude is wearing a city top when they would only finish 16th in the league back then 😂
Big Steve destroyed robbie and yeah City is bigger then Arsenal and will keeping getting bigger
imagine this interview was now lol
Grealish is so clear😂😂😂
rob is so painful to listen to what a special man
Two worst people to do this. They couldnt have a civilized debate if they tried.  The delusion between the two genuinely gave me anxiety
Gotta have a swig of the pint when doing a cheers lads 😂
This aged well 🤣🤣🤣
Fk Manchester fans #COYG
Here's a non biased best pl teams of all time:  1. United 07/08 2. City Centurions  3. United Trebel 1999 4. Arsenal Invincibles  5. Mourinho Chelsea  6. Liverpool 2019
I think Arsenal are much bigger club they have much longer history more trophies you can't  just look at the premier League era you got a look  at all history of the big teams.
I live  in Essex and arsenal have very poor  support spurs r bigger
4:28 Robbie blud called it
Watching this I’m march 2023 really makes me laugh as an arsenal fan 😂
Now only half city player could play for our starter. Walker,ruben,rodri,KDB,haaland.
Where did you find a man city fan ?
You can go invincible and get relegated,  but you can't have 100 points and not win the league
FFP enough said
Invincible’s are over rated tbh if you break it down as a hole
As we’re a year from this video I’ll give my honest arsenal city team (THIS SEASON) Gk. Ramsdale Rb. White Cb. Dias Cb. Saliba Lb. Zinchenko (Ake is extremely close)  CDM. Partey Cm. Odegaard Cm. De bruyne Rw. Saka St. Haaland Lw. Martinelli Some of these are debatable But just I personally prefer all these players. Arsenal fan.
10:08 the debate is OVER 💥💯
1:50 it's already OVER! 💥✅
Jesus the bellies on these 2
Robbie at least get your facts right. Arsenal in 2002/03 actually lost 6 games then went unbeaten the next season.
I’m not a city fan but I can understand city fans not giving a balls about people calling them an oil club, especially by fans who don’t actually attend games and are watching from Ireland or Malaysia. They don’t understand the highs and lows of actually following a team. You can turn off the tv and forget about it, it’s not the same as lads traveling across the country and getting battered 4-0 who then have to travel all the way back with that in their head. Football isn’t a tv show, but they don’t understand that sitting in their couch commenting “No fans” over and over on city posts
1 of 30 man city fans, a rare sight
But it true.. how can you say you are best team in north London? won jack, since god knows when.  Are you mad..  You show them the all stats but they just WONT HAVE IT….. I hate that club with a passion.  Trust me..
Keep your treble 99 I’ve had my aguero moment and 6-1 at old Trafford 😂😂
Every Arsenal fan is the exact same. “It’s all about the history. Oh you can never be as big a club as Arsenal. Oh well you bought your titles doesn’t count. Well if Arsenal bought their titles I wouldn’t not count it but yours don’t count anyway.”
This season this would be an interesting debate
Lmao looking at this now
Man city will never be a big club money got you there from 2006 you was fighting to stay up and in 2008 you was rich well today good news for everyone who's not a man city fan they be kicked to the championship
I’d love another one like this rn as arsenal are top
Arsenal fans are delusional 😂 forget history it’s been and gone move on history don’t win anything & all this talk about money if arsenal ended up with money like city would they not spend it the same way on bettering the team?😅
City guy was so deluded speaking about stadium fullness, christ 😂
Crazy how times have changed. Now saka saliba  partey odeggard and martnelli would all make it to city squad.
To be honest all arsenal talk about is invincibles with invincibles throphy
2 clubs with no european glory. Least to say fair battle.
I think it's the money aspect with a lot of people with city, as much as it pains me they are bigger than arsenal rn
👁️👁️
Big Steve bodied robbie man lmao 😂
Robbie talks out his arse , he may have knowledge of the club but his debating skills are pathetic, Big Steve smashed this debate with respect and won it, imagine being this old and laughing at your own jokes to dull out steve trying to argue his point.
As a city fan, I confirm that Man city isn't just buying trophies. They are building their history as we look at how Man city sign many players they didn't waste their money on stupid players. As we see Manchester United right now(2022) they pay more money than us like signing 2 players from Ajax worth more than 100 million pounds, but Man city just bought Haaland only around 60 million pounds.
I absolutely despise Robbie
Just bought 5 man city season tickets😐
They didint buy the league, United spent the same amount and didint win it since fergie left
Put invinibles and centurions in same szn and the team With most points win and that is city
Man City are bigger now. Arsenal are a tinpot banter club big steve was right
Citeh is bigger right now pls accept that
Saka at lb 😂😂😂wow
Putting Man city against Arsenal is a disgrace in Ty’s voice 😅
Fat manc ye nans dead
Robbie keep interrupting man chill out let the guy talk then say what you wana say
You paid for it and went broke 😂😂😂😍😂
If the Centurions and the Invincibles were playing in the same season in the same league, City would have won by ten points
Robbie top G
Now Smith rowe can't even get a game at arsenal haha
Im an arsenal fan but i agree with the manchester city guys centurion argument.
i dont know what was guardiola thinking with grealish. 100 milion for that ?!?!? he is just not at the requisite level for a club like city is and wants to be and that was painfully obvious even while he was at aston villa. he is the modern day stewart downing ffs. you dont win leagues when players like that are featured prominently and 100 milion is too much for a bench cheerleader.
None are big 0 champions league
This arsenal guy is so bitter when this other dude talk about city achievements.
Robbie's brain doesn't exist
nah its the oil money
the final speech WOW . nearly moved me to tears! amazing! there was so much passion that he was uninterrupted, looked at with admiration and was in total agreement in silence !
I hate that this guy and his followers are what the media portrays as a typical arsenal fans. Utter pricks!
Grealish is better
You  Walk Down the Street and pepol say Oh he is a City fan i found one violation
Hate it when people bring up history. History has to be written. That is what city are doing.
i’m a united fan but smith rowe can’t even get on the pitch😅
Saliba easily gets in city's squad
Note he’s waring the city top when they were shit. You havnt got the right to argue with an arsenal fan mate. You support a club that’s got no passion, history, legacy your basically the United States of football. Discovered by mistake and attracted loads of immigrants to your club. If they have bought a proper football club that has passionate fans like Newcastle or Leeds etc then they would have realised what a mistake they made. Jack Grealish wouldn’t have signed for yous over one of the top clubs if yous hadn’t offered him treble the wages the other top clubs would have same goes for all your players. Mercenaries.
The most delusional Arsenal fan ever lol
Robbie is way too delusional...
Not even a City fan but centurions is a far better accomplishment
robbie is so Biased it's amazing ...
Can you imagine a Man U vs Man City with Big Steve and Andy Tate?! They’d have to clear the room haha
This city fan is a dipshit
Like two bold men arguing over a comb.
1, 2, 3, 4, I declare a thumb war
your son is board of going Wembley OMG true supports never get Board of that
Real fans, its so go too watch. Smart  and respect each other. Positive vibes.
Ramsdale over Ederson 😂😂😂 I lost it
That is one typical arsenal fan. Absolutely delusional
Chelsea were nobody? We had a european trophy, fa cup and finished third before we were bought mateee
Arsenal fans will use trophies as an argument to Tottenham fans and then they see the trophy argument invalid whenever another club argues to them. Ok mate
10:48 the off camera laugh is brilliant. It’s so true though not to diminish the invincibles, what a team. But the highest ever points total amongst the other records broken was special.
him saying arsenal having a meltdown at 7th place just shows that it is infact the bigger club😂
City and Chelsea bought their trophies, remind me though - what part of London did Arsenal scout Henry, Bergkamp, Viera, Gilberto, Ljunberg, Pires……. from?
robbie argues like a tiktok fan account
That Arsenal supporter has absolutely no arguments
This sam don is the most delusional man ever
😂
"robbie big club again"  🤣🤣🤣
City fans are hilarious
Man city minus oil money equals spurs
This Man City fan is savage. Saying it straight 😂
Treated Wenger like shit!
This is honestly my favourite head to head video
Smithrowe Is better than grealish, grealish is overhyped. Man City fans are so deluded
What a surprise Robbie being a delusional arsenal fan as always
Wow, you guys make great tv. Loved watching that.
Loads of empty seats at arsenal when they play cup games
I want ty
my man big stvie big up dem city lads batters the assna rats
Ramsdale over Ederson is a laugh
City are making history as we speak but arsenal are a bigger club at the moment
I love this dude,he looks so innocent 😇
I’m a Real Madrid fan and I think the invincibles don’t get enough credit ppl always bring them down saying Chelsea 05 and 99 treble is better because they drew so much but remember they won the league by that point so they didn’t risk it since they manager was so conservative, in my opinions they should’ve won a champions league from 97-06 one of those years at least they were on fire
Robbie is lying through his teeth. He would kill for Arsenal to be doing what City are
How’s he comparing moments like 6-1 against United to winning a treble 😂
Steve and mark Goldbridge would have a good debate
Current success of city will eventually be its history in 20 years time.....the centurions , domestic quad , back to back twice , 4 PL in 5 all of it.....
That comment at 2:34 lol🤣
Invincible is better than 100 Points  - Coming from a Chelsea fan
Edison has been PL keeper of the year three years in a row, never been done. He shared the last with alisson but still.
City better rn, but arsenal history and fans much better. I would say ESR > Grealish, mostly from this season.
Not that mad of a shout Grealish is one of the most overrated players in recent memory
Robbie is so unbelievably biased. He’s spent too much time with Ty, he doesn’t even let Steve speak
History and fan base makes the club what it is. City are generations behind Man Utd liverpool and arsenal. Fact. Maybe in 20 years time
Centurions >> invincibles
Man seh is this the history channel😂😂 Arsenal is a mid table club...deal with it.
"We built what we we got....." - Robbie doesn't realise that AFC are the original franchise club and literally PAID to be in the old 1st Division.
how did man city not buy the league lol
Does Robbie know he’s talking to a plastic fan?? I don’t think he does
Both of them are second rate!
17:35 respect to Man City guy
Who rates Aaron ramsdale over ederson with a straight face 😂
I hate the money argument there isn’t a Club in England that’s poor hello tv revenue 💰
That Arsenal fan is so bias
Steve explaining his fan journey was honestly incredible 🫡
I can't believe he used the word jealousy where was this man when they didn't have the riches to draw players to man city does he really think they would be there without their hundreds of thousands a week
Smith Rowe better player than grealish yeah robbie has to pack up and leave mann he's capping on another level
How this Man City fan trynna tell us City didn't bought their trophies🤣
There's a lot of similarities with these 2 teams. Not just the players like he mentioned buying many Arsenal players Anelka, Seaman, KoloToure, Adebayor, StuartTaylor, Vieira, Nasri, Clichy, Sagna etc... and also Lee Dixon who supported ManCity growing up but played many years at Arsenal etc...  But both have not won the champions league and have a really bad CL record with few semi-final appearances and only 1 final each.  Also look at Arsenal's 5 PL seasons 1994/95 to 1998/99  (1) 94/95: 12th (out of 22, so finished above 10 teams). (2) 95/96: 5th (3) 96/97: 3rd (ManUtd won) (4) 97/98: 1st (Won their first PL title by half a point, doing the double over ManUtd was imperative). (5) 98/99: 2nd with 78pts (ManUtd got their trophy back). Arsenal also won 1 FAcup in this 5 year period, ManUtd won 3 out of 5 PL titles.  ManCity 5 PL seasons from 2008/09 to 2012/13  (1) 2008/09: 10th (Out of 20, so finished above 10 teams). (2) 2009/10: 5th (3) 2010/11: 3rd (ManUtd won) (4) 2011/12: 1st (Won their first PL title by half a point, doing the double over ManUtd was imperative). (5) 2012/13: 2nd with 78pts (ManUtd got their trophy back). ManCity also won 1 FAcup in this 5 year period, ManUtd won 3 out of 5 PL titles.  In the next 7 seasons for Arsenal (1) 99/00 2nd (In CL lost to Barca) (2) 00/01 2nd (In CL lost 1-0 in Munich to Bayern in group stage but didn't lose at home to them, played at the StadioOlympico and also got knocked out by Spanish team who played in the final that year). (3) 01/02 1st (4) 02/03 2nd (78 pts) (5) 03/04 1st (unprecedented PL season with no losses, Champions league quarter finalists) (6) 04/05 2nd (won FAcup) (7) 05/06 4th  In the next 7 seasons for ManCity (1) 13/14 1st (In CL lost to Barca) (2) 14/15 2nd (In CL lost 1-0 in Munich to Bayern in group stage but didn't lose at home to them, played at the Stadio Olympico and also got knocked out by Spanish team who played in the final that year). (3) 15/16 4th (4) 16/17 3rd (78pts) (5) 17/18 1st (unprecedented PL season with 100points, Champions league quarter finalists) (6) 18/19 1st (Won FAcup) (7) 19/20 2nd  Overall PL positions equal to exact same average.   By the way incase any of you are confused as to why I say won by 'half a point'. It means you either won on GD or you won by 1 point but with worse GD than eventual 2nd, so in both cases the team finishing 2nd would've finished 1st if they scored just 1 more point than they did, wouldn't have been level they would've been above, so you only really won by half a point. Like in away goal rule 2 leg ties if you draw 0-0 away 1st leg and you're in the middle of the 2nd leg winning 1-0 you only have half a goal lead really as you'll be eliminated if it finishes 1-1 it won't be a tie.
Everyone is bitter about city and chelsea because they have money and the only reason this is because all your owners are tight as fuck!🤣
That was complete rubbish from Robbie saying Arsenal only lost 1 game the season before invincibles. They lost 6. Also the season after invincibles they lost 5 and the season after that 11. However in 2001/02 they only lost 3 and were unbeaten away all season. Maybe he was thinking of that season but still incorrect.
Robbie ain't half got humpty Dumpty's head
Liverpool fan I'd take smith Rowe over grealish all day long
class men 👏🏾
Arsenal fan Dont know🤣: History are Created. Every Club  Has its Own History. Talking Based on history is shit.
Pointless arguing these things with deluded Arseanal fans. Come on! Don't you know that every Arseanal player is better than any other player at any other club in the premier league? That's why they finished 5th🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Fair play to the city guy talking about his fan journey from the mud to the top, but he still didn't disprove that city haven't bought all their major trophies.
Invincibles is a good achievement, but I have to agree with the city fan (as much as I'd hate to do so), getting 100 points is way harder. If you park the bus every game, you could feasibly win a few and draw loads to win the league, but getting 100 points even with a few losses is just way too hard.
100mil is enough pressure already.. you can’t pay such a huge amount and don’t expect immediate results. Saka cost Arsenal how much? Look at his performance, he has played 3 different positions in the arsenal team. His far better than that 100mil shit
Robbie does not represent all of us Arsenal fans
This city fan has humiliated arsenal
Robbie got exposed
Big Steve is one of the funniest guy’s in the World
City won again 😂😂😂 on and off the pitch 💥
Aston Villa also has history 😂
City are making history right now they're breaking records winning trophies it's only when people look back they will realize city are bigger then arsenal in current times right now they're bigger than arsenal 🇮🇪💙
It’s true, I’ve not seen a city fan in person for ages
I’m no city fan but the clear bitterness from Arsenal fans is hilarious. There’s no group of fans who wouldn’t want what city has in terms of financials. Why wouldn’t they?! Hypocritical and it’s obvious.
Ramsdale…. Robbie sounds like Ty
Are all City fans bald frauds????
The invincible team would smoke center backs of otemendi and kompany that city team isn’t even the best city team. Same argument is with the warriors they had the best record in the nba but would that team beat the 72-10 bulls? Nah Arsenal yes we drew 12 games but a whole season unbeaten in the league that alone, is something that teams haven’t done yet. They loose 2-3 games now a days. And the second highest points were 99 by Liverpool 19/20. I just think that to play unbeaten in the Prem especially in 04 was something that we will never see again and I see the 100 points being broken before the invincible record is
No Arsenal players would get into city starting lineup I’ll just say that lol 😂 and I’m a die hard Arsenal fan
17:44 ❤️😭
The Arsenal fan tells the City fan that his team is not even the biggest in his city as if Arsenal is the biggest team in London ahead of Chelsea?
The invincibles are so overrated
i agree with big steve
I dont like City... but this fan is good and puts a bit of context to fans who've been on a journey!
I think the traditional top clubs are united, liverpool and arsenal and along the way chelsea and city joined them, idont get the hype about spurs but whatevs.  Its easy to say that city bought their history but thats not really their fault. If other clubs had citys money they would have used it as well. In say 20-30 years people might say newcastle is one of the biggest clubs.  Big clubs Will always be seen as big clubs, if not they are sleeping giants, and more heroes are coming every now and then. History and future is developing therefore i think that if city Will keep this trophy pace they Will be on a same level as arsenal. Not because of the history, but because of the trophies
Grealish was defo not worth 100 million pounds! Even when he was playing really well he wasn't worth that much!
This city fan is being a bit disrespectful to arsenal.
Manchester City fan is a twit. They are not a big club. Without the money where would they be? Probably in the championship
The INVINCIBLES have a movie the centurions has no movie
Arsenal is better than city because they have swap more than 2coaches in the last decade and they spend bigggg money.... If they do what Arsenal do they will go down the drain....
yeh but grealish is ass
Gotta agree smithrow over grealish this season
City will always be the small and loud baby
Honestly another 20 years from now and city keep winning they’ll have that “history” and the likes of these arsenal fans have nothing to argue.
This fat ARSENEL fan is just too jelous 👀
Battle of the buffet right here
Arsenal have won 13 league titles including the only UNBEATEN title ever, 14 FA cups and we are the 3rd most successful club in English football history behind only United and Pool. We will always be bigger than these johnny come latelys!
Right now city are bigger than Arsenal and that's a fact
City fans says Arsenal haven't won the PL for 15 years, whereas them haven't even notice for a century
The problem with Arsenal,Liverpool and Man Utd they live in the past and assume no club will ever be greater than them because of the history. Well with the exception of Liverpool (until Klopp goes) the other two haven’t be relevant for 20 years (Arsenal) 10 (Man Utd) and most likely won’t be for even longer! Even Liverpool haven’t achieved what they did in the 80’s, Chelsea and City are on 5 and 6 prem titles alone as well as multiple cups domestic and European cups for at least soon to be both so by that standard if they continue to win the same amount or more over the two decades which they will they WILL surpass all three. So sorry but except it those days are gone these clubs along with Newcastle are the future of success and BIGGEST clubs. Deal with it snowflakes.
Oh so making it to the champions league final does count. You hear that fellow spurs fans!!
That city fan is a melt job every where he goes. They suck on the tit of a regime that murders journalists and then gloats about their trophies, embarrassing. They couldn't even fill there fan allocation in the FA cup semi against Liverpool. Arsenal are a far, far, far bigger club than those monopolychester cheats.
the only thing these lads would agree on is which shampoo they use.
Robbie embarrasses himself everytime he does these things. The only thing they have to cling to is the invincible season. Its so embarassing and I'm a neutral.
Big clubs dont only mean trophies. Just like robbie said a big club is about everything. fans, history, trophies, how they got big and especially how known they are worldwide. City are no where near that level and will take ages to get there. If a club with the least amount of fans had the most trophies in the world they wouldnt be the biggest, they would however be the more succesfull club.
It's ok saying clubs buy trophies but you have to have the manager and leaders to bring them players together as team mates and set everyone up to play at their maximum potential
Arsenal's 03/04 team got the title "Invincibles" not because they didn't lose a match all season. It's because they *WON THE LEAGUE* and did not lose a single match all season. Also take into account that the other 19 EPL teams Arsenal faced in the 03/04 season were far superior than the other 19 EPL teams Man City faced in the 17/18 season Put Arsenal's 03/04 team in the 17/18 season and they'll still be unbeaten.  But if you put Man City's 17/18 team in the 03/04 season, they won't even win the title, much less accumulate 100 points.
10 more years and City will have more fans than Arsenal
106
manchester 'oil money' city
I’ve never seen someone chat as much bs as this City fan 🤦🏽‍♂️
Stealish is absolute dog shit. ESR pisses all over him  Stealish has spent the last 4 months warming the bench and prior to that when he was playing week in week out he did fuck all  The ONLY premier league goal he has is one that bounced off his thigh and he knew nothing about  Guys an embarrassing laughing stock
I'm a arsenal fan I think grealish is better but we got Smith rowe for less
This is proof that arsenal have the most deluded fans ever
Man city fans getting really uppity recently lol
now smith rowe is struggling
That last part of the video gives me goosebumps.
How you big club  and haven’t got trophies in 15 years lol in 5 more  it will be 20 years lol
2nd time I've seen Robbie on here and he is getting owned yet again
Man city has surpassed Arsenal already
Arsenal sell out every week🤣🤣🤣 Grow up Robbie stop chatting utter shite
Man City is making it's history now. 10-20 years from today if we continue on the form that we are on now then yes i would say that City could be a bigger club than Arsenal
let's put this into context.  Delloite has Man city down as the most lucrative club in the world. Above Liverpool, Real Madrid, juventus, man utd.  😂 you can't tell me these aren't the most dodgy club in the world. They can win titles but it will never be respected because they haven't done it properly
This Man City fan had basically admitted they bought their trophies.  ‘When Abramovic came in there was no FFP and he picked everybody’  There was no FFP when Shiek Mansour came in either. They bought Robinho for a British Transfer record, they tried to offer Kaka 500k a week and tried to buy Iker Cassias for £130m in 2009, and that’s to name a few.  Man City and Chelsea wouldn’t be where they are today if it wasn’t for these billionaire owners. They bought their success. FACT
Thomas Partey ahead if fernandinho and rodgri
Grealish is so much better than ESR and that’s coming from a very bitter Villa fan. Best player to put on a Villa shirt since we won the European Cup
My man don Robbie just basically said Smith Rowe better than Bernardo,grealish and foden Saka better than mahrez And ramsdale better than ederson How do Arsenal fans come up with this shit
Freakish is shite
It's funny how bias clouds judgement and logic. As a neutral I can say City can't replace the history of certain clubs. They're not the biggest in Manchester. History isn't 5 seasons. The next 10/15 years will be a different story if City continue to bring in trophies.
his point about the Journey of City is sooo valid! no one can argue with it haha
Im taking smith Rowe over grealish any day of the week.
both are so deluded. this is just a "yes. no. yes. no. yes. no" argument
ROBBIE CHATTING CRAP CITY BIGGER FACT
Grealish better
Listen I like smith rowe but he isn't as good as grealish don't be silly yes he ain't been on top form this season but ability wise grealish better
Right off the bat arsenal fan is delusional, time never stops and soon enough all this will be history😂 therefor man city can create history and become bigger then you guys. Yes in a way they will always be the first to achieve success but doesn’t mean they will always have more that’s beyond delusional
The one with Lee judges was so much better, Arsenal fans refuse to acknowledge robbie
robbie chatting shit when he said they lost once in two seasons, they lost 6 games in 2003, does robbie know that more teams in Europe went inviciple than more teams that won a treble, i swear arsenal fans a typical
this city fans team won the lottery and he thinks its a big club.. Robbie is right
Robbie is a brilliant and honest fair fan...
Centurions team 100% better than invincibles. Any football fan knows this
1:45 what a statement, just silenced Robbie
Gotta say I hate city but the arsenal fan isn’t really raising any valid facts
5:27 is a metaphor for all arsenal fans, Ederson is the best keeper on the planet right now. Delusion personified.
Big Steve speaks facts 💙
"We taking over the Party".💙💙💙
Robbie lost this debate real talk
Please!please! don’t ever have Ty back! Robbie is 100% better and actually debates the actual questions asked.
Man City fan on point throughout this. Can't blame them for having the money and buying trophies, any team in the premier league would take that money to compete. I don't personally respect the trophy buying but their team talent and coaching and club structure is undeniably amazing at this point in time. City fan wins this one.
Why does the man city fan have an iron cross tattoo ?
And That Is Hard 2_Write As A Liverpool Fan
Robbie Is A Great Guy, Arsenal Went 49 Games Unbeaten,
Grealish>Smith Rowe dpmo
what if Arsenal play on 3rd league in 100 years and city play like today win PL titels and stuff... sura City can be a bigger club than Arsenal. This "NEVER" makes 0 sense
When big Steve mentioned his journey as a city fan 😭💙 that was it for me. Man won the entire debate with that part. It was emotional and shows exactly what it takes for fans to do absolutely everything to follow their club Respect To the Legend Big Steve
I'm sick of rival fans going on about money all of our clubs spend stupid money each transfer window and if you want to be the best you have too buy the best players and the best players cost the most money its such a petty non-argument
This comment section is so delusional.
Looks like Steve bout to cry every second
i mean if the centurions was in the invincible season arsenal woudl still not have won the league lol 12 draws from really equals 4 wins and 8 loses points wise over twelwe games
With the greatest respect to Man City who are now a free flowing footballing institution, two relegations in the PL era severely damages reputation.  Arsenal have been going through a harsh rebuild, I cannot deny that one bit. However, even during this phase we've been able to win trophies and stay somewhat respectable.
Don Robbie surely didn't say saka over cancelo and grealish isn't even a consistent starter for city
why was Grealish vs Smith Rowe even a conversation… Grealish doesn’t even start
I don’t understand why most fans are so thick headed and unreasonable. Blindly arguing for their club without any realism or intelligence. The only person that’s come across well in this series is Gary Neville in the latest one. The rest seem like absolute mugs, these are the worst.
People who say Grealish haven’t been good this season literally don’t watch the games, see the stats, and want to make an opinion lol he’s been playing really well just in a different side and pep is asking him to play in a different manner
Stay off glue arsenal man
Arsenal fans are just delusional.. you just cant debate them
This City fan's arrogance is outrageous. Everytime.
17:45 onwards.   Being a proper Millwall Fan (not idiot who shouts crap and causes trouble) I understand how he feels and would give anything to win the FA Cup.
GREALISH IS SHIT AT CITYYYYY
Centurions is way more impressive than the invincibles
Man City will never be as big a club as Arsenal, from a Villa fan.
This is what I’m going to say to everyone who talks smack about city and saying “we know why” we’ve had success recently. All of you lot should not be talking smack because at some point in time your clubs were the highest spending clubs in the world, city will be the one top clubs in the world as time passes. All these guys are saying “history”, well clearly as time passes well have more history. The question is will they ever not are they, there’s a difference.
I just clocked Steve and Robbie are the same people just different skin colour 🤣
Robbie's abit of a hypocrite.. He knew that AFTV caused the fans to treat Wenger poorly.. It was AFTV that stoked the fans to hate on Wenger
The other  team fans saying mancity and Chelsea bought their trophy can you say that with less tears in your eyes... For we all know you wish it was your team
Smith Rowe is clear of grealish, the best bit about Robbie as a arsenal fan he is awake unlike the rest of the arsenal fan
I’m spurs but ESR has been slightly better this season. Grealish was nice on viller tho
Every time I think about the end of Wenger’s tenure at Arsenal I always think about the Quote from the Dark Knight, “you either die the hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain”.
No way Robbie believes Pep Guardiola would pick Ramsdale over Ederson.
Smith-Rowe has been better than Grealish this season and it not debatable
The first question just seems deluded to say no because “history” yes they don’t have any history now but theyre making history now, so in 100 years Man City will have that lineage
Arsenal are a bigger club than mcfc, real fans sort of.  ⚒ that hurt to say. Also the invincible team will remain that until the next unbeaten team emerges and it’s not mcfc
Robbieee burned him Alive lol
United has spent almost same amount of money as city in last few years and they still can't get the trophy
Arsenal guy gets on my nerves, he has no arguments nothing, no respect, holding on to the past, accept it, Arsenal is fucking shite.
Still backing Arsenal this guy, just take the L, Arsenal is fockin shite. Clueless this Arsenal guy, doesn't know shit about football just stuck in hystorie.
Don Robbie the Legend <3
troops and expressions should come on here
So big club means the bigger fan base? Wowww. Trophy wont count now?
As a neutral, until city win a champions league / dominate the premier league without losing a single game then, they're building the history to be a big club..But even then....arsenal did it years ago already.
Both are big clubs and thats a fact but Manchester city is a bigger club now il admit Arsenal were bigger but look at the facts. very cheap from a current arsenal fan to talk about money and attendance 😂
won the league in 1937, 1968 4 fa cups before the takeover  2 league cups before the takeover  1 European cup winners cup before the takeover   Yeah no history defo
Smith Rowe would get in over Grealish  i am not a fan of either club  Arsenal fans are sort of pathethic though when it comes to the invincibles  it is the only thing that Arsenal fans have left to brag about
(Not an Arsenal fan) Robbie absolutely bossed this. Big Steve is just speaking from passion without giving any ground or consideration.  Arsenal are the bigger club. They've won more, done it for longer and is shown because they have a bigger fan base. They aren't in a good spot now, but city wouldnt be either without all that money. Arsenal are where they are now because they couldnt spend like City and Chelsea. They will come back, because they have a bigger brand. People want to play for Arsenal. Other players don't go to City for the club, they go for the money/manager.  Also, invincible is much bigger achievement than 100 points (especially given the scenarios at the time - i.e. money wasnt astronomical, the difference between the teams were less etc.). to get 100 points, you can not turn up in 4-5 games (it's still a big achievement) but to go unbeaten, you have to turn up every week and perform for a whole season. It's an unrivaled achievement.  Also - Steve's comment about City fan's getting bored of going to Wembley sums up everyones opinion of them. Their success is bought and not earned, and therefore it's not as appreciated by the fans. They expect to win most games. Less excitement. Less sense of achievement. They are a team of mercenaries that arent playing for the badge. And the fans know it.
Sorry but this guy. Of Arsenal tv is a bloody joke shouldn’t have him on here get a proper fan on and that comes from  a lfc fan
Not an arsenal fan but I actually agree that Smith-Rowe is a better player than Grealish. Grealish is an expert at winning free-kicks, but aside from that he is pretty ineffective and slows down play too much. He is still a good player, but not as good as ESW.
The irony of Robbie saying money well spent when Arsenal have by far spent the most in the Premier League this season and done fuck all. You could say about Arsenal - money not well spent 😂
I am  LFC fan and agree with the Arsenal guy. man SHITTY are not even the biggest club in Manchester
Man City Fan: Left Bak Arsenal Fan: Left Baek
Man said ramsdale over ederson 😂😂. Good goalie but come on. Arsenal are a massive club but Christ Robbie is living in the past here
It's not true Arsenal lost only 1 game in 2002-03 season. I just checked it and they lost 6 games that season, but they went unbeaten away from home in 2001-02 season.
“Man City will never be as big a club as Arsenal”   I disagree and here’s why. We are saying about never. If we judged it based on now then everyone would say Arsenal based on history and what they won etc. What people forget is what Man City are doing now will be seen as history in 30+ years. Then you look back in 50 years and would say it’s roughly even or maybe Man City are bigger based on the history in 2070. So think about the bigger picture and the future
Not even a single arsenal player can fit into man city starting 11. From a Liverpool fan
BENFICA IS BIGGER THAN THIS BOTH CLUBS🙃
smith rowe on 10? did you forget about de bruyne lmao
Robbie is the most deluded fan going. And that says a lot when you look at who else is on aftv
Watching Arsenal and Man Utd fans these days reminds me of when I used to defend average-bad players like Igor Biscan and Alberto Aquilani. I was so wrong and now United and Arsenal are doing the same.
30 years ago Liverpool were miles ahead of United as the biggest club in England.20 years of success with Fergie and that changed. 20 years ago, Arsenal was a nothing club until they hired Wenger. Taking trophies regularly  from teams such as United, Newcastle, Blackburn made them increase their profile and stature over time, and build this 'History' that Robbie so passionately reminds everyone about. Despite his denial, Man City are set up perfectly to become a bigger club that Arsenal across all metrics. I reckon they are already halfway there. (YNWA).
Ramsdale over ederson! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
From a chelsea fan. Emirates is always full compared to emptihad
City aren't a bigger club than arsenal. They are the 3rd biggest in the country city could become bigger but aren't right now
Arsenal are a joke. Thats what people think
Imagine now… Arsenal just relegate and never come back up for the next 40 years… meanwhile Man City wins like 10 UCLs and 30 PL titles… who will be the bigger team… “never” become bigger than Arsenal? True that they are historians Arsenal fans
He’s embarrassing arsenal man…. This guys a fool
1:59 lol
God bless everyone. Give your life unto Jesus follow God
I wish one of these lads would take a sip on their pint ffs. Sat there waffling for 20 mins and the pints are still full to the brim.
Even if Citeh won the league every year for the next 50 years, and arsenal won nothing, Arsenals history would still be worth twice as much as cities. Because arsenal built their trophy winning players. Man City gets everyone pre made. This is why City fans all wank over Foden, cause he's the only player who came through their youth system that hasn't been loaned out multiple times, and hasn't been sold to a second division or relegation battling team
Fuck me how can that bald lad say city didn’t buy trophies so delusional
Check these two shirt pullers out!  I thought it was a sumo match at first
“we’ve built what we’ve got, what have you built?” facts from robbie right there
No arsenal player is good enough for city let’s face it but saka on the bench is what I’d take
ESR is better than Grealish.
Man City are making history!
SAF said No team that are Desirous to WIN the EUROPEAN CUP/ UCL can win the Domestic Treble as the focus has to be reasonably Prioritised,  these CITEH Fans never use CONTEXT FFS 🤣🤦🏽‍♂️
Hard to call City a big club right now when, after winning as much as they have in the past 15 years, they still can't even fill their own stadium.
"City have no history compared to other clubs." Before the 90s United won the league only 7 times in a century of existence. Liverpool won 11 of their 19 titles in just 17 years, did they have history before the 70s? If only clubs that had "history" were allowed to have success then the biggest clubs in England would be Sunderland and Aston Villa. Arsenal had more glory in the past, but City's making history now.
The invincibles are one of the best, if not the best sides in PL-history, but being invincible with I believe 12 draws isn't nearly as good of an archivement as having the most points ever in a season or winning a treble (of double for that matter)
Robbie was the one that allowed all the offensive and disrespectful abuse towards Mr Wenger by his fan tv, aftv crew. For a man that helped to set arsenal fc on top internationally, the most successful manager of Arsenal FC. he deserved better and for bossie robbie to allow this man and his family to be abused in such a disgraceful manner by your aftv, you have a lot to answer for, time is longer than rope and time is the master, so i would advice you to REPENT so your present success can be a blessing. REPENT ROBBIE REPENT or the KARMA road will not be an easy one to travel.
By Robbies logic Nottingham forest are a bigger club than arsenal because of the history
to be fair to the city fans they are the only club in manchester
I'm an Arsenal fan but I think the centurions had better team in terms of squad but I think the first 11 for the invinsibles was the best and most balanced first 11 in the Prem's history (1992 onwards)
City haven't thrown money willy nilly?? What oh yeh just the 5 fullbacks you've bought and how you bought a GK. Next season sold and another bought 🤣🤣 man's mad haha
Grealish isn't a wide left player... His average position for villa for years was out on the left. May start as a 10 but hes always drifted to the left 🤦🏻
im a saints fan love to see this with pompey and saints fans the interview would be over in 30 seconds  lol. ramsdale and smith rowe would get into mancity squad but not first eleven thats a joke. arsenal have a bigger history but now they are certainly not a bigger team - southampton are a bigger team than arsenal. mancity would probably still win without a keeper lol
Why do Man City and Arsenal fans make terrible urologists? Cause they'll never have your-pee-in-a-cup.
I’d say Gabriel would be in for a shout
That guy who would play ramsdale instead of Ederson is a funny guy
City fans last speech is lit man
When the don wagges the finger you no your deep in trouble
You must spend wisely that's a fact. Players we have bought have been very good for City. Not just building up the most expensive squad in the country like United and failing to win anything.
Arsenal fans have no right to say “YOURE NOT EVEN THE BIGGEST CLUB IN MANCHESTER” 💀 we all know what color LONDON is 🔵
Big Steve is a genius. Talking nothing but facts and being hilarious wit it 😂
Hair fight
All Big Steve had to say was Nasri😂🤣
I get bored watching city play nothing excited about their style yeah they win games and what not but it’s boring football and I’m not even an Arsenal Chelsea Liverpool Tottenham or Man U fan I just love football
Man city fan, didn’t think they were real
One thing they strongly agree on, being fat
Make a Real Madrid VS Barca one please
😂😂😂😂😂 esr bigger than grealish my foot comparing a filthy kid to grealish how do they even have balls to do that
both teams can talk big until bayern munich roll up, bigger club then both togher
As a city fan grealish is not up to standard, especially with 100 mil price.
Tierney Cancelo or Cancelo Walker what's better?
Call - Celtic vs Rangers fan and ask them which team is better ? 😃😂
Manchester City also had fans didn't know.
This city fan is good speaker and talks in points 😂😂😂
From 17:46, massive respect to the die hard city fans
To be fair I know more Man U fans and arsenal fans in the USA then city but maybe it’s cause I don’t live in a big state or city lol
MAN CITY ARE BETTER THAN ARSE-NIL GUARDIOLA IS BETTER THAN WENGER CENTURIONS GOT MORE POINTS THAN INVINCIBLES Come on City
"no, you walk down the streets and they say, oh that's a city fan. Oh I've actually found one" had me dying 🤣
I liked that city fan until He said they didn’t buy their trophies 🤦🏼‍♂️ surely that’s a wind up
1 game lost in 2 years is incredible
"Hey steve champions again, thanks man, Robbie big club again man thanks man" That had me dead
Mancity are bigger than arsenal
Why did Robbie not mention Aubameyang as Man City lack a real no.9 even with Jesus even including Aubameyangs poor form and losing the arsenal cap I would still argue that he would make the Man City team
Big Steve says nothing but facts
You know your a dodgy club when you would oppose democracy in the UAE, because it would cut of your supply to oil money as the ruling family that owns your club would no longer have access to the countries oil reserves.   I find it appalling the Bin Laden family that own Man City would indulge in vanity projects like this when there are kids in the UAE eating rats and people working all day in the heat for 4 pound a day.   City fans support dictatorships in the middle east. They are traitors to Great Britain.
Yesssssssss
They're just different colored versions of one another
💙💙💙💙💙
ederson walker dias laporte cancelo kdb rodri bernardo  mahrez foden sterling  saka and esr are on the bench with grealish
Man city will be a bigger club than arsenal one day. Neutral fan here
We do need someone to carry the water bottles 😹😹😹
Is this ainsley hariot?
GREALISH will get used to the team. But what matters is he is going to win trophies and he is in a winning side
when he said no arsenal playeers would get in citys team and counted 321 a add popped up
Saka left back 😂😂😂😂
Robbie fucked himself with his first answer. Of course Man City CAN become as big a club as arsenal.
Robbie stick to AFTV 🤦‍♂️
Truth is that Greslish doesn't even make City's best 11. Let alone Arsenal's or a combined.
Watching this as a Liverpool support it’s so entertaining, knowing you are the biggest team in England 😝
Do a city and united onee
The 38 point invincible point had the Arsenal man looking high in the heavens. 🤫🤣🤣🤣👀👀👀
It took Robbie a minute to think of 2 decent players for arsenal, it would take me 3 years...probably.
I have literally never met a city fan
Mans saying it's hard to get a season ticket at Emptyhad
I wouldnt be surprised if mancity make a statue of an oil tank in their stadium😵‍💫
9:23 “I’m a fair man” 😂😂😂
We fill St James on the reg, even when we're getting beat 1-0 by a League 1 side 💀😂
History FC
Why only 'Man City bought their trophies'?... This pathetic argument has to stop!
Don't agree with last question Even United spent almost the same amount but look at them. They got literally the title winning contender team and one of the best team across all 5 leagues but look at them. Spending ≠ investing.
Will never understand the logic of these history merchants 🤦🏻‍♂️ even if their club is in down the drains at present, they'd still console themselves by saying "but but we have history though" well nobody gives free points for your history flex! Focus on present, dude.
10:24
title of this video should have been, "From Barnsley to Bernabeu I have seen it all."
We need City vs United
If thats the arguement, every team has bought their trophies, the tickets to trophies are just more expensive nowdays. Yes city have spent much but so has chelsea real madrid barca and man utd. Have all these teams seen the sucess that city have? Real madrid yes but the others NO! What differentiates city from the others? buying the right players and not hyped up players that turning into deadwood or getting injured regurlary, developing and maintaining a brilliany youth academy (so have chelsea and barca) building homes and infrastructure, upgrading training facilities. if we take the english clubs, chelsea and utd have spent almost as much as city during these last 15 years but is nowhere close maintaining the same dominance/level that city has. ALSO! Were the prem as good in the early 2000 as it is today? NO. Therefor it is much harder to become the centurions  or the formidables now than for 15-20 years ago, for 15-20 years ago winning the league was like the level of a spurs team today and every other team was a norwich or a burnley side
“Even the stadium you bought it” what else are you supposed to do, grow it in your nans back garden🤣
That title 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Funny this! Not one European cup between the pair of them 🤣
09:45 "The formidables, the expendables" 😹😹this guy is disrespectful but so funny
@1:46 facts
Stop inviting this Arsenal fan... Dude has literally nothing to say, he's stuck in the past.
Borg cating shit ey
It's easy for people to say Man City brought their trophies, but it's easier to win titles with the kind of money they have spent.
Wow arsenal fans are soo deluded, I thought TY was the only one but damn Robbie is the same.
Robbie just banter without logic, all things are emotions with him. I dislike to hear arsenal fans have football conversation .
All am gonna say is CHAMPIONS OFF EUROPE YAL NEVER SING THAT
This City fan proves they don't have real fans and are only just glory-hunters. They're the new United fans.
What is going on with Arsenal fans? They are so deluded it’s unbelievable!
He couldn't have had less of an argument on buying the trophies. What does Grimsby have to do with anything?
Smith Rowe is better than Grealish right now
BS.Ask that lump about Danny Fizman who put loads of money into arsenal .
People need to remember that money almost means nothing in football if you don't know how to make a player. City signed players like rodri, dias, laporte, players that no one really knew well other then their previous clubs fans. Dias, had a wonder season and he's continuing it, longevity isn't bought, it's taught. City may be bantered with the oil money but at least they spend it right, no? united spent 80m on maguire, how did that work out? everyone was praising bruno last season because of how well he was playing, where is he this season? Ronaldo was an incredible signing that they got, however he's a hindrance on the rest of the team, bruno plays with less freedom which caps his skill, rashford is playing more passive rather then going at them aggressively, almost every united player is carelessly crossing it into the box because ronaldos there, they're not even aiming. Don't banter city if you can't talk your way out of it.
Tierney would get in at left back without question, Gabriel over Laporte, Partey over Rodri
Top 4 Chelsea Man City(UCL) negative Liverpool Man UTD
This man really thinks that Saka and Smith Rowe get in our team😂😂😂😂
All the little kids would say the Man City fan is deluded but really he isint
Enjoyed that cheers. City fan was spot on
All you have to do is ask the neutral fan (like myself) and anybody will say being centurions with the highest points tally ever is a much greater achievement than being invincibles
Robbie complains about City stadium when his own stadium is titled Emirates. What a comedian.
You cannot survive forever by drinking on past glory. There is a saying "Forget the past even if it is a glorious one". The very YouTube on which we are seeing videos  has more Man City subscriptions than Arsenal.
The Invincibles were great, but there are definitely several holes you can punch in their accomplishments. For one, look at the quality of the top 10 in 2003/2004 compared to the last 5 or 6 years. Chelsea and United finished 2nd and 3rd that season and neither cracked 80 points. Charlton, Bolton and Fulham all finished top 10, whereas in the previous season they finished 12th-18th. Another argument is that Arsenal dropped points in 12 games, that's basically a third of the gameweeks in which they failed to win. The Invincibles had a 68% win percentage. The Centurions and the 98 point title defending side meanwhile not only won 84% of their games, but broke nearly all the attacking records playing at a time when the top 10 is better quality than it was in the early 2000s. And yes, money is a big reason why their are more heavy hitters in the last 6 to 7 years than before.
Ima tell u something , some people in portugal don't know who arsenal is .... But everyone who ones a little about football loves city. It's a "new" club it will take time until it gets more fans but all the time are people borning so
The club should erect some type of monument outside the Etihad and engrave the names of fans like this. What he's been through with that club is really incredible. That statement "Ive been on a journey, division 2 barnsley all the way up to the bernabeu" will stick with me.
City have more fans around the world actually, higher revenue, higher average attendance percentage. They are absolutely a big club. City is a more recognizable brand than Arsenal outside of the UK with more recognizable players that’s big. Leeds has history, villa have history, they aren’t big.
Why would he have Saka in at LB when it's Tierney who plays LB for Arsenal? Saka is not a LB.
“You was on the front line “ 😂 Lol
Big Steve vs Andy Tate please lol.
There’s a reason why they went invincible and no one else has it’s the same reason they DONT have a ucl and the other top clubs do except city. When you get to March/April if your winning the league you prioritise the champions league and other comps and the ucl knockouts and rest players. Which allows for slip ups. Arsenal didn’t and it’s the same reason they won nothing else that season. That simple really.
AFTV is literally bigger than Arsenal
I love Arsenal but this is embarrassing
I’m a Chelsea fan but Ima just say it here. In terms of which club is bigger worldwide between City and Arsenal it’s definitely Arsenal. End of discussion
The rubbish they talk is unbelievable, never know how this guy got famous, same as the wee scouse nob
Didn’t know phill Mitchell supported Man U
As a neutral I would say ramsdale is a better keeper then ederson
Disappointed in Robbie, why is he acting so delusional here? He's usually one of the more level-headed ones on AFTV. I think Ty possessed him here
This was so good. Love the passion of both of you in the last two questions. That made this video. Thank you both
Steve’s more logical and rational than Robbie. Robbie argues with his heart and not his brain
Bro put respect on Saka name...he will destroy most of your team like the other day lmao stop waffling!
Smith Rowe 8 goals 2 assists since this interview
The funniest thing is everyone is saying how man city is the club buying their succes while arsernal spent 165 million this summer while man city only spent 127. And then you compare the league table.
Steve is a blue 💙
Arsenal are not a big club. Last league title was 18 years ago…. They hold a great record of 0 European cups/ucl and they have 0 balondor winners. They are a wanna b big club and always will b
Smith Rowe might get in over Grealish but Grealish doesn’t even play most of the time so that point is irrelevant
In 50 years Man City will be a much bigger club with much more fans than Arsenal
Robbie gotta be the dumbest arsenal fan on the planet man gosh
City have already eclipsed Arsenal, alot of cities success comes from so many arsenal purchases which is ironic, City consumed arsenal's best and now look down on them and laugh....well tbf we all laugh at arsenal and this figurehead they have on YouTube, so dumb.
He can't call himself a city fan and then pronounce Cancelo as "CanChello". So plastic lmfao
Man city fan is jokesss hahahha
great representation of an actual city fan
Arsenal better thank City for keeping this invincible thing relevant. I mean Chelsea and Liverpool lost one game each and both were to City
The fact that Arsenal fans are making an argument about something that happened more than 15 years ago just proves that aesenal arent a big team anymore. City is building their history and in 10 seasons we have won 7 titles.
All the Grealish haters will eat their words next season😂😂😂😂
We need to see big Steve V James Redmond
Grealish may start for city  but atleast Smith Rowe scores on purpose and not on accident 🤣🤣 the only reason Grealish starts is because they use him for the dives🤣😭
I’d rather take 198 points across 2 season than 1 game lost
Im not an Arsenal fan but it’s true. Smith Rowe has been better than Grealish this season
Ying yang twins
Wow they found a real Man City fan
Grealish isn’t even good tbh cheaper and better players
Arsenal fans were slating ramsdale before he went
I am in love with this series! Keep them coming!
Smith rowe is better than grealish and iam better than smith rowe
Robbie forgets about Henry Norris.
Has anyone ever actually touched that pint in any of these episodes. Talk about flat
Everyone can agree man City are in their prime with some of the best players in there squad and yet they have bottled champions league every season
People saying city don’t have history, city are making history
City can win all the tittle but they will never be a bigger club
Biggest 3 clubs in England are Liverpool, Man Utd and Arsenal. That will NEVER change
As united fan the city fan emberaassed arsenal fan
Getting 100 points in premier right now is harder than invincibles at that time
Ngl I don't like city but Robbie got duppied hard on this 😂😂😂😂
define a big club? answer me that one. For me, i base it on fan base, history, titles.. a legacy
2 people fighting about 2 player but when they face each other both of then is on the bunch😂
You have bought your trophies though. Every single one! Over 2 billion spent since your club started in 2008. And still not won champions league. Joke of a club that buys officials and FIFA top men as much as you buy players 😂
C'MON CITEH!
In 50 years Man City “history” wise will be bigger than Arsenal due to the success under pep and there only going to get better
Well city don’t have a 9 so you could definitely put lacazette in there. I’m sure aubameyang would make it on skill alone
A huge number of kids who started watching football in the last decade or so are city fans..... And the fanbase is just growing while the arsenal fanbase has been on the decline.... Its stupid to say that city will never have as many fans as arsenal has..... If we keep winning trophies its obvious that every new kid will support city.... The reason why arsenal has a lot of fans is because they were dominant in the 2000s
Saeed and big steve the next one 📈📈📈📈
Robbie knows the majority of arsenal fans treated arsene awfully, and his lot spearheaded in
Who cares about the centurions they had money back then we didn't have money we built our team they bought there team
Y they not drinking the pints 😋
if I found out something about almost every football fan in britain is that they can't be unbiased. the only one I agree almost everything with is Rory, and even though I like Man Utd. the guy that said that Varane and Maguire are better than Matip and VVD, and than nowadays ronaldo is better than salah made me dislike the united fans, lol
Man said a banter club
Ąłəx §ķıňñęř
He keeps talking about how much city spends, but Arsenal spend a lot of money too, the difference is just that city use their money wisely.
World renowned Arsenal fans are everywhere…. All delusional 😂😂😂
This is a funny city fan🤣
atm yeah city are bigger than us but we're on the way up we're fourth rn we hit rock bottom last season but we're on our way up  and no debate esr is clear of grealish this season  also respect to my guys city fan's journey
I’m sorry but bro looks fucking 45 years old and he still saying the same excuses I see 13 yo old insta talking about no fans and empty stadium😂😂😂
Wait man city has fans
i think man city are bigger club than arsenal personally now dont care about fans . emirates has empty seats every game
On that’s so true I only know 1 man city fan in ma life since I was born Nd grew up Nd I’m 24
There’s a difference between being a bigger club and a better club city is a better club but arsenal is the bigger club
robby is so deluded. unreal.
Chelsea did beat the invincibles on the day but they did go and win so not really unbeaten
Most Arsenal fans like Man City. I do. Well I did before they stated winning everything
They already are pretty damn Big
The Centurian team is better to me, the logic being because if you dropped that team into the Invincibles season (and assume they draw both games against each other), City would win that league due to having more points. Arsenal would finish second undefeated. So it HAS to be a better achievement. Like the guy said you can draw 38 games, be invincible and get relegated 😂😂😂
Invincible is better than centurians
To do what City did and get 100 points is far more impressive, especially with the likes of Liverpool getting 90+ points in the season as well. When you're going out to win every game, you will inevitably lose one or two in the process. Arsenal setting up to not get beat used to work in the prem but fact of the matter is, they wouldn't have even won the league in the modern era due to not getting enough points.
Definitely find these interesting, I’m an Arsenal fan - gonna play along and see what I come up with 🤣  1. City never be a bigger club - Disagree. Currently Arsenal bigger, worldwide and got history -but City are making theirs as we speak. 2. No Arsenal players in City team - Agree. City best team in the league by a mile and for a reason. ESR been better than Grealish this season, but Grealish warming the bench at the mo… Ake played at the weekend, Tomiyasu over him but again Ake not 1st choice. 3. Invincibles better than Current city side - Strongly agree, never been done before and yet to be done again. If it was as easy as people say it would’ve been done already 4. Arsenal fans treated Wenger poorly - Agree, some did, but not all… I think the time for Wenger to leave was the season before he did, and with hindsight people are maybe now seeing the job he did - and getting top 4 with the squad he had was crazy. But the disrespect and venom/ferocity of the criticism was too strong - and driven a LOT by AFTV… 5. Man City Bought their trophies - Strongly agree. Can’t say anything but, and they 100% would not be where they are without spending the billions they did… But, it is what it is, and I’d love it as an Arsenal fan. I don’t think that should tarnish their success, though… Still have to put it all into motion, and have ripped through enough teams cos they’ve had the money to, as Chelsea did before them, and as Newcastle will do in the next 10 years.
Ramsdale is overrated heavy. Some of the worst goalkeeping positioning in the premier and has also made mistakes this season
Saka , Smith Rowe can easily get into the City team.
I disagree with City fan arsenal are big club. Plus city can't even win champions league.
This is awesome please more of these types of videos.
Both teasn never full stadiums out and both fans never sing, end of!
As a MCFC fan the fact that he said no Arsenal player can get into city is dumb
They look like black and white versions of each other.
he's the best bald guy I've seen  after pep baldiola
Please bring more guests like this City fan, and stay away from that utter nutter of a Liverpool fan debating Chelsea fan...I could barely finish that video
This just shows how deluded arsenal fans actually are
Big Steve ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The Don being kind by gracing his presence on lad bible
robbie is deluded.
The fact he said Man City are bigger than Arsenal shows just how behind this lad is
Current form smith rowe > grealish. All time Grealish > rowe. Coming from a city fan
oh man that Arsenal fan is delusional. He talks with his heart not his head
Big Steve is wearing the wrong kit lol
Samir was a Arsenal player and then city got him 😂
Robbie always loses these debates because he has to blindly support Arsenal and their players.  Arsenal may not get a player in city’s 18 let alone starting 11
Ederson ball playing ability and kicking range is underrated
Robbie is talking with emotions. Arsenal is a bigger club yes but City to become a bigger club is isn't impossible. We also don't have any players that would walk into City's starting XI. We have whole load of potentials but City have the developed and established players.
at the end he silenced everyone
Say what you want about City but as the years are rolling on the silverware is sticking to them like iron fillings to a magnet.
Robbie a coward for not answering the wenger question.
Arsenal are a bigger club than Manchester city.
I’m an arsenal fan but yo Man City guy had me dyinggggg 😂😂😂😂
18 30
This city fella is gassed 😂
Arsenal fans are biggest whingers, cannot stand them or the club.
Big up the citizens
Love the chemistry between these two lmaoooo
There’s the difference between local city supporters and others like in my country. I respect that but guys in my country start supporting city in 2013-2015 and act like they bleed in blue when in fact when they were kids they were supporting likes of liverpool&arsenal. I genuinely believe we can’t change our fav teams and idk how many years till united win the league, i just know that I’ll never change my club
Saka can start at RW. Telling me he’s not in Mahrez’s level is bs. ESR is better than Grealish atm. If City need a proper 9, Laca can be in the team. Partey could be a solid sub for Gundogan and Rodri. Tierney could fill in for Cancelo if he plays RB. Tomiyasu could play RB if Walker is injured and they don’t have anyone to play LB except Cancelo. Gabriel is better than Laporte and maybe Stones this season. Ramsdale has performed better than Ederson this season. A lot of arsenal players could get into the team if Grealish can.
Big Steve won the argument Big Robbie resulted to insults
The hate for City’s success and greatness and how they have changed the style and play of English football is becoming quite clear and evident lol
Smith Rowe miles better than grealish
“City will never have history”. City’s making history everyday bruv, we breaking records every year
As a Man United fan, Centurions are more impressive than the Invincibles 🤷‍♂️
If Grealish wasnt English he'd be quick sold ages ago
@17:44 He put his heart and soul into that argument. That was solid.
The invincible got 90 points. Big achievement.
Tierney would get in
DONT GET IT TWISTED. CITY ARE A GOOD TEAM NOT A BIG CLUB
"Chelsea were nobody before abramovic" mate don't talk about what you don't know. Chelsea was a champions league side even before abramovic came in. Even beating the mighty invincible arsenal in CL and kicked them out of the competition. And chelsea still had more european trophies than arsenal. Know your level robbie
Arsenal fan here this current team is better than the invincibles
People talk about history this and history that, yes is a part of being a big club but in 100 or 200 years it’s not going to matter because they all gonna be going way back.
Ramsdale over Ederson is absurd.
i think city one that debate all we need is a ucl  win and haaland
Robbie is so delusional but City have bought all there trophies so I don't understand how any of there fans can be proud to support that club. And the invincibles are the most over rated thing in football draw so many games
This man city guy is not talking any sense 🤦
Genuine question what defines a big club?
Grelish is a better player than smith Rowe. Fair enough he hasn’t had the better season but overall he is a better player with more attributes. Smith Rowe may turn out to be the better player but at the moment jack gets the nod.
'Those guys in Qatar would of love that" When the club owners are from UAE! Should we go an call it ignorance and racism?
The state of that man City fan wow
Man City are just a live action fifa ultimate team
Robbie is so biased 😂
Grealish is an amazing player. So is ESR.
Smith Rowe dosent even start for Arsenal man hahah
I’m an Arsenal fan. In 1919, Arsenal got promoted because they bribed their way up to div 1. Throughout the 70s-80s, George Graham used to give little envelope jobs😅😅. Sick of people complaining about other teams’ money and acting like we’re “classy”. Was it classy to “BREAK AWAY” and form a PREMIER LEAGUE in 1992. Is it “classy” to sell 50 different kits every season for £80 each.
Arsenal is the 3rd biggest club after Liverpool and Man United.  City has a long way too go, to be bigger then thoose 3.
They actually found a city fan? Nice.
No way man just said grealish > smith rowe 💀
Here after 2-1 city 😁
There's no way you prefer being invincible one season than having the most points of all time
Centurians,Invincible.. ...Utd Treble lost only 3 premier League games and won the treble. Beating Arsenal for the title and in the FA cup semis and that champions league group! We lost no champions league games
these "big teams" fans need to start seeing smaller teams fans perspective. who cares about history? we need to win, and we need money to compete against you guys because you guys always using money to buy the best players or buying our best players, and now after we actually getting tired beaten left and right and get the actual money ,you guys shitting on us saying we are no big clubs so we cannot buy players and cannot compete!?
We need more of these type of football related videos.
Chelsea's 04 side was a better team than the Invincibles. They only lost 1 game and that too a penalty.
City don't fill their stadium and that's a fact
Beautiful sentiment regarding life as a city fan from Big Steve…and I’m a United fan. Reminds you of the essence of football fan hood
3 minutes in and the city fan is already talking waffle
I actually didn’t realise how ignorant Robbie is, he sees the rest of the league through an entirely Arsenal perspective, no objectivity.
There are a lot of kids from all over the world who have started watching football from the 2010s.....And I'm sure that a majority of them will support city.... So if a lack of fans is what makes city a small club, its definitely gonna change in the next ten years...
😂🔥
You could still take a shout for an Arsenal striker really any. Let’s just say with aubamayang because look with city’s strikers you are getting goals but could be more lethal with a proper striker and you can’t just reject auba because I know even with the current form that Manchester city would still gladly take Kane so knowing what is inside of a player as in with their capabilities then you could still give auba a shout
The speech by the city fan at the end was nice but nothing he said was disagreeing that they had bought trophies.
Smith Rowe wouldn’t get in the city squad but is still well clear of Grealish
I think some arsenal players could get in to man city just bc they don’t have very many out n out number 9s
Cringe.
Robbie is chatting out of his arse most of the times. Love you big Steve you absolute legend. Representing all the proper City fans around the globe💙💙🥺
Robbie is insufferable and I’m an Arsenal fan
ESR gets in over foden easily foden is massively overrated everytime I watch city he’s bang average and I’m left scratching my head why people rate him so highly
If history doesn’t matter then what is the point in winning anything now if it’s never gonna matter again?  Also, he goes on to say city got the most points in history. Instant contradiction?
Delusional Arsenal fans , I live in Asia and Arsenal shirts are never ever seen 😂
One FA Cup won the right way before you die, is worth more than every other trophy bought
i hate the fact that any time someone starts talking about man city it’s about the fact that they’re not a bigger club. that means nothing. it’s not a museum. it’s sport. your either winning and making history or you’re losing and becoming history. not the same thing
wait so there is a city fan?
Robbie most deluded fella on earth
It will take Manchester City another 20 years to consider in the level of prestige Arsenal, United and Liverpool has no matter how much oil money they throw around to buy titles. Im not a gunner but theres a massive difference between traditional clubs with history behind it and with once with oil money being poured in to get buy success. Richard Mille is expensive but anyone with class always picks the Patek Philippe for a tuxedo event
City are creating history right now.
Realistically no arsenal players play ahead of a city player
I think it’s ridiculous to say City will never be a big team. And as for history, city are creating history right now. 30 years from now, the trophies city are winning currently will be considered history.
Neither have a cl trophy. It’s a draw
Arsenal fans are mad deluded!
Smith Rowe?? I want what he’s smoking…
Martinelli is better than Grealish. So is Saka.   Outfootballed 11 v 11.   young team. We are coming.   Pep will need to sepdn as econd billion
Ferguson even said Phil Jones will be Uniteds best player  Not only that he also rated Scott McSauce  So this Ferguson said this, Ferguson said that is bullshit because even he gets things wrong
Assnal guy said he has full stadiums but yesterday there were plenty of empty seats😂
arsenal fans are shameless i swearr
Steve finished him 🤣🤣🤣
This City fan is hilarious
Cant afford to draw games if you want to catch City Arsenal invincible drew 12 games 😂
hes not a genuine city fan, glory supporter
Tbh im abit upset by this video, I've got to around 12 mins and no one has touch there drink 🤣🤣🤣
Big up Steve,said everything that needed to be said. Up the Blues
So first he says City are new to the party, then he says Ramsdale gets in over Ederson... Premier league champion and Ramsdale from relegation team who has had a good season SO FAR...how many pints did he drink before lol 😂😂 I know it's for argument sake..but some consciousness would be appreciated... Ooops sry it's an Arsenal fan OK nvm.
Funny how neither of them talk about the European cup wins lol 6 times
Big up Steve…. All proud blues
Yeah.. Gooner were promoting and intend to sell their prize assets soon. Selling and Banter club never change. LMAO
To all the Man City haters - ‘The past was yours but the future’s ours’.
Todays trophies will be 20yrs in the future history. Arsenal history is 2000s and late 1990s. 20yrs ago that was….
And City are a tiny club. Second division global reach and bought their trophies from dodgy petrol money. Watch Newcastle rise in the next 5 years.
The petrol FC fan is a joke. Claiming the centurions accomplishment is better than  invincibles is patently rubbish. The quality of opposition was MUCH HIGHER years ago. Man City got their 100 points against many awful teams - Arsenal got their invincible season against some extremely talented and competitive sides.
Saka is better than sterling and foden and grealish and Gabriel Jesus... Partey is better than rodri and fernandinho
This arsenal stupids are so stupid that I can't tell you .Smith is playing good and looking good because you don't have any good players on the pitch .when you are sitting in the car and suddenly you saw the tires of heavy truck it looks so big .but the same thing when you sit in the heavy truck and try to look the tires of car you can't even see . Put the Smith on mancity squad and think he looks so Small that even our acedamy players are better than him .man playing in the high level with higher challenges and  quality it's difficult to find the foot and grilish has many years to prove and he is a quality player and different than other players
Arsenal a big club? Lol 🤣
WE WANT TY ON THIS
He said henry is better than ronaldo too
City never gonna big
I'd have Aaron over exertion, because he's nearly as good as him on the ball, but a better shot stopped! But nobody else from arsenal is cracking into that man city starting team, but granted they're almost all young so will surely improve with time, then we'll see, who knows maybe city end up trying to buy them... I think the invincibles was a bigger achievement -the football was one thing but their mentality was like nothing else - but the city side of the last few years is a better team imo, but maybe you argue they haven't had enough completion as the league has been rubbish, only lvpl have been able to muster a fight here & there.
I'm a United fan. Big Steve had Robbie off here
But no champions league both of u looool only man u,Chelsea  and liverpool are big clubs
ESR has been incredible so far tbf has definitely had a better start than Grealish this season however Grealish deserves time to adapt to City
Typical gooner, better than grealish lol
Every club and their fans having a hard time swallowing the fact that City is a way bigger club than theirs for the past 7-8 years, I get it your club has history big stuff, but football is about what’s happening right now, THE PRESENT, and what City is doing right now will go down in your so called “HISTORY” and when you’ll tally the stats after 30-40 years you’ll get to know. History won’t bring you trophies lol
Man city are prem merchants and they will NEVER conquer EUROPE....NEVER!!!
City did buy their success, any team who gets money in like that wins the league
Arsenal are a bigger club end of, but city are the much better team the last decade. If City carry on they will certainly be a bigger club than Arsenal   No Arsenal player would get in that City team, saka and smith rowe on bench.  City’s best team is the best the Orem has ever seen !
Robbie on the drugs if he thinks smith rowe is anywhere near grealish
Dis city guy is spitting facts
I hate the fact a club can come out of nowhere an say they’re a big club, fair play to city the past 10 years they have been the best club in england, but a big club comes from decades of winning trophies. 20 years ago man city was just another Burnley or Watford.
Smith Rowe is a much better player than Grealish, just the fact they’re getting compared and one is 21 and the other 25
biased manchester city fan
Robbie waffling shite for 90% - normally much better
Robbie massively overrated Arsenal players.
City wont be a big club until they win the CL .. BUT I have a feeling it could be this year.
Grealish is never worth 100million, nowhere near as good as Declan Rice.
“If Manchester City Draw 38 games we are invincible and Relegated” had me DEAD
Arsenal fan? That's the don you're talking about
Why does he keep saying man city fans like there is plural.
Ruby has nothing to do with Football ( i am an Arsenal Fan). Idk why he get all the attention and had interviews, They’re much better than him
😂😂😂
One day, there’s gonna be a full on fight in one of these 😂
I see no champions leagues in the video
Citeh fan with a shirt straight out of the packet lol got a to love the effort
Just gettin Robbie to do these debates
Don Robbie investing in the history channel now lol.
So the guy wearing emirates sponsor shirt accusing city fan of Oil money funny inmit
I'm a United fan and I actually disagree with the idea that City bought their trophies. They won the financial lottery yes but there was still never any guarantees. Their transfers up until Grealish had not been marquee in the truest sense of the word. They were mostly required and well suited. They've also built the foundation and academy and instilled the idea of success into the club for generations potentially. None of these things were guaranteed initially by having a rich owner. Edit: People win the lottery every week and we know from history how that tends to go.

Please do other club fans against Epl club fans i.e. Milan, Bayern, Real, Barca etc
The Invincibles argument is perfect from Big Steve!
when the city fan talked about his journey i had some type of feeling, made me have tremendous respect for city fans and i continue to wish on y’all’s success
City are a great team. But they don’t have pedigree. The reason they are even considered a big team right now is because pep is there.   This man city team is a really more of a pep team and when he leaves, everyone will see them at the same level as Leicester city and Tottenham. Again most city players don’t want to play for “Manchester city”. They are there because of money and pep. That is why when a big club comes calling they go immediately. Mahrez, cancelo, grealish, Laporte, rodri, dias, Bernardo Silva, gundogan. You think these guys came to play for Manchester city? Naaaaa they are there for pep. And when he leaves, they are mostly likely gonna leave too or perform poorly. Look at sané, ferran Torres,garcia. The moment a big club came calling, they left
Big Steve. I'm an Arsenal fan and I don't hate the banter. I quite love it
The Arsenal Invincibles was a great team but the Centurions had the most points ever, the most wins ever, and the most goals ever and then went on the next season to get 98 points. I will take the Centurions for those reasons.
Haha Smith Rowe is not even in the first 11 or Arsenal, how can he get into City’s first 11.
I love and respect city fans like him. The ones that truly love the club and find the time to educate themselves. Just a sucking shame 99% of city fans are fucking plastic. #thebeautifulgame
You’re a businessman you’re a businessman, all it cost you is 15 years and no trophies ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
Ramsdale over ederson is pure insanity. You could go onto to spit straight facts for the rest of the video, but you’ve already lost all credibility with that ridiculous take.
How does being rubbish before your club was bought do anything but add to the argument that money bought your success?
“Little gold trophy they got out a kinder egg” 😂😂😂🤣
Arsene didn’t have the backing of the club, i would have like to see him been backed the same way that Pep or Jose were at their clubs
ESR may be over performing a bit, given how he has scored so much as a sub, but I would want to see him back in the starting XI and see how much he performs as a starter. Oodegard is performing better as a starter than ESR. But ESR is better than Jack right now
Very moving speech that in the end!
Rhodri the next kompany
They got a combined weight of a truck
Arsenal fans are so deluded man, just hanging onto that invincible season for dear life 🤣
Arsenal didn’t even sell out vs city
Ederson is the most overrated keeper
"Youre having a good tine at the party but youre gonna wake up with a hangover!" amazing
“Not even biggest club on Manchester “ legend 😂
City build Nothing in football I'm a united fan but arsenal are a way bigger club
City fans are all the same 😂😂😂
I laughed out loud when the City guy said "Is this the history channel?" at the beginning, thinking that I liked this guy.  At 16:50 I'm now turning off the video. I don't want to watch the rest of it, I don't want to hear whatever he has to say. Strongly disagree???!!! Really??? That's pure delusion. If all that Arab money hadn't been pumped into the club, Man City of the last 10 years would at best have been an "almost team"  like Spurs were for a few seasons with Pochettino! Actually, imagining 2007 City ever becoming that good is a serious stretch.
This Man City fan is so fucking annoying
Only tierney would get into city’s team, I support arsenal. It’s him or zinchenko, for me that’s the only one
smith rowe to be fair has been outstanding
Arsenal fan here. ESR has been great for us this season but I don’t think he’s a better player than Jack Grealish nor do I think we should even be comparing them. Let ESR continue to flourish, who actually gives a fuck about these comparisons.
how dare he disagree with the don?
Centurions would absolutely smash invincibles
That argument is silly .How can you campare  someone who is not yet a world class player with the one who is already
Woooow first question my man went strongly lol... Never bigger than the A sorry mate. Globally City isn't shit tbh.
I can remember before Man City got brought by their owners they got relegated and always finished in the bottom half
If pep leaves city that would be the day I believe Chelsea has a chance to win the league 💀
Man City fan spitting facts about almost everything
Manchester city should be kicked out of premier league, they are too good already 11 points clear ffs 🤦🏽‍♂️ I gave up on these man, they have class squad and the best manager.
one is living in history one's is making history in front of one the best teams and the best league.
‘You’d be supporting boreham wood’ 😭😭😭
Let's be realistic about it.  Are Man City big club?  Depends on your definition and even if go with Robbies one and say that they aren't.  If they continue with same trajectory for both clubs in 50 years Arsenal are gonna be another Leeds whilst Man City is going to be "Arsenal" or "Man Utd" that we know..  And that's coming from a Chelsea fan.   Don't understand how some of these fans on this channels can be so irrational and blinded by their bias.
Saka wouldn’t even make Man City’s bench ffs
My younger brother came up to me saw Robbie and was like “is that Lacazette” 🤣💀
I don’t get why city fans don’t just admit they bought everything? It’s not a bad thing, it’s just how football is now. Bought well, yes! But still BOUGHT
City bought their tittles. No shame in it. Fans of other clubs would probably love it for themselves but it is true. They bought their tittles.
City fans are awful
Let’s get it clear, it’s city throwing and leading the party
Arsenal's only History is the invincibility.... Nothing before that matters
ramsdale is a fair suggestion but its close
4:55 man, why cant the fans on here be more normal, i know you are passionate and all but even as a city fan, come on, emille has been insane, saka has been insane, saka is so diverse and think of this, cancelo and saka linking up on the right with mahrez as a deep lying center forward that roams to the right with sterling on the left, foden can play midfield so no worries about him and jesus is a super sub anyways in that #9 role. think of the pep guardiola style stevie. de bruyne playing balls behind the defenders with saka recieving it and running at the defence is a dream
imo yes we are not the biggest team in manchester, but neither is arsenal the biggest team in london... chelsea are huge aswell, and they have champions leagues to go with the fanbase the size of arsenal
ederson gonna win the golden glove again and he’s saying ramsdale
Emirates was empty vs City today and it always has empty seats as well
If it wasn't for City, Chelsea would've had an invincible season as well, Chelsea only lost 1 game in 2004/05 season, it was a 1-0 defeat to...... Manchester City at The City of Manchester stadium.
city CAN be a bigger club, and i enphasise can because history is made in the present and if city keep doing them for the next however long that eventually go from recent history to former glory, this team is quite new and as long as it keeps growing it can eventually surpase these big teams.
5:15 damnnn that was cold 😂😂💙
Come on city 💙 City>>>>>>All Prem teams.
ive been a city fan my whole life and i consider myself passionate but compitant, grealish has lacked skill but he hasnt played much and like robbie said, emille has been better this season which is just factual, same with saka they both have perfomed well.
swap grealish  and smith rowe and grealish dominates for arsenal and smith rowe would not be able to handle the level city expect.... thats obvious, SR is doing well because hes on an average side and being given the chance to make mistakes and has the backing of being one of their own. totally different situation going and playing for city....
Fair play to that guy wish I had been on that journey. Instead of a spursy joruney
Bro smth row is working so hard to be b tech Grealish
Smith Rowe is better than grealish
Two gud passionate lads about there teams great vid
Just one piece of trivia, my club, benfica has lost a league title undefeated, but has olso won one undefeated
the invincibles lost to paok 😙
Love these debates even if they aren’t my team Good job lad bible  Would love derby vs forest 😂
People always says many clubs use money to buy trophy. If it is so easy like u say, why your club dont do that ?
Foden better than grealish and smith rowe
Full stadiums , arsenals attendence vs city today was a disgrace. And ppl call our ground the emptihad
Don robbie is smoking that good stuff hey Ramsdale over Ederson 😂😂😂😂
😂🤣😂🤣Arsenal are bigger than man City???? Omg you lot really are dreamers. Arsenal are hanging on to the top 6. City rule the top! Only arsenal fans or City haters would say this. History my assss. Its called history for a reason. You lot are pathetically holding on to ANYTHING to keep your clubs relevant 😂😂😂😂
Only player who could get in is tomiyasu
Big Steve is so jokes
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
This guy is funny… ESR can’t even bench odegaard anymore
Abu Dhabi. Not Qatar. It’s like me saying all of your fans are from Somalia, not Lagos! 😏
Gotta get TY on here at some point
I genuinely can’t watch this Robbie without pulling my hair out. The guy needs to wake up and realise winning is the main objective in football, arsenal can carry on being a ‘big club’ while everyone else wins trophies.
Robbie is actually them guys that argue with u on Instagram . Just annoying try and put every achievement you’ve done down and make there’s out to be the best he’s actually like a 10 year old not letting people speak and mocking them he’s a grown man .
I'm Chelsea fan's I grew arsenal will come back again 💪💪
Lol of course the man city fan doesn't think history is important
Robbie ‘we’ve built got what we’ve got’ Ignoring that Arsenal just spent 150 millions
Man city are a small club. They got bought simply because the owners wouldn't have had to invest as much to win as you maybe would have done at other clubs, because of the stadium etc. Of course, the longer time goes on, their trophy cabinet is going to get more and more impressive, likely get a champions league or two as well, but there's levels to this and granted trophies is a major component to being a big club, but its about more than simply foreign investment. Arsenal, liverpool, man utd etc. were built by the fans, have had tragedies, have rebuilt under numerous regimes and owners. They got where they were organically
Grealish is shit smith Rowe is better
Big Steve is a top bloke…He talks sense…As a LFC fan,Man City are too good…it’s too hard to catch them…City are brilliant
ManCity & Chelsea bought their successes. Their achievements will never be as authentic as Arsenal, Manu, Liverpool, Leicester etc.
Fun fact… arsenal lost more games in the 03-04 season then Man Utd in there 1999 treble winning campaign 🏆🏆🏆
City fans are all former Bolton supporters who switched clubs due to a big investment from some saudis
idk why Robbie makes the argument that they paid for the team. NO SHIT, when investors buy a team there’s suppose to invest into a better squad. Tf else you want them to do.
Arsenal finished a whole season unbeaten and only lost one game the previous season,which means 2 seasons they only lost one game,unmatched
You can’t argue with Robbie this guy is literally living in a different dimension where Arsenal have had recent success
Well said mate. Cheers from Man City fans in Indonesia!
Robbie is so deluded there is no point even having a conversation with that guy
Arsenal wouldn’t even go unbeaten in league 2 now and thats 2 divisions lower than division 2😭
How can people actually think the invincibles are better than the centurions
Okay okay but those are two of the most upsetting pints I've ever seen
Arsenal are a laughable club. There is clearly not one player in Arsenals side that could get into City's. Awful, joke of a club.
i hate how much robbie talks about how city ‘bought’ everything
Gotta love watching this while city are 1 nill down at halftime
The ‘big club’ argument is clutching at straws. So Leeds, notts Forrest and Sunderland are bigger clubs than arsenal then?
The City fan is deluded 😂 😂
m not a city fan.....but arsenal fans ...thinks they have the best everyything in the world and still they were not in top 7 last year.....westam.are better then them
tomiyasu over walker this season
Arsenal fans<<<<<
The City Fan look like he was crying when Robbie said Smith Rowe's better than Grealish cause he knew he was right. 🤣
Manchester City fans not only rare af to find but they are also delusional lmao 😭
Did Robbie say those guys over in Qatar?? Abu Dhabi - get the oil state right
I may be a spurs fan but Smith row is a banging player and he's deffo better than grealish 100%
Overall: Arsenal: 13 league titles Man City: 7 league titles Last they won: Arsenal: 2004 Man City:2021 Arsenal: we are a big club Man City: SHUT UP YOU'RE A BANTER CLUB, WE'VE WON MORE THAN YOU
I feel like punching the city fan the smug shit
Deluded city fans actually believe they earned their trophies 😂 if they didn't buy their trophies then where were these premier League trophies before the takeover
Big steve takes W imo 😁
Big up Borehamwood FC!
I will say, across the world, in younger generations city would rival arsenal in fans. Im from australia and there are a lot more city fans then arsenal fans. And the arsenal fans only support them because of their parents usually and arent up all night watching the games at 2 am like other supporters.
Man City are a very good team but the disillusion from their fans that they are a bigger club than Arsenal is Ridiculous. The fact he’s strongly disagreed is embarrassing. Robbie killed him with the not even biggest club in Manchester 🤣 Saka gets in that City team. ESR on current form gets in the City team right now ahead of Grealish & Foden. Tierney gets in. The disrespect towards the invincible team from him is also scandalous. It absolutely destroys all those City teams.
does auba walk into cities side? maybe not the way theyre playing but it can work no?
As an arsenal fan this video is embarrassing,  Man City are so far ahead of Arsenal it's a joke. Most of our starting 11 couldn't even start on their bench. Stop talking about big clubs, as the city fan says who cares if you aren't winning anything.
As a Villa fan, I will have to go with Smith Rowe for now. But give Jack some time to get used to Pep's system at Man City, he will be a beast once he gets used to it.
How’s he saying grealish isn’t a wide left player and with all the money there have spent and the trophies they have won they still can’t grow their fan base and when they win a trophy there’s can’t make noise because there not a big enough club to do it
Smith-Rowe is good but playing for City is different. Every week 11 men behind the ball, zero space, the other team literally set up camp and refuse to go forward, it's hard to do anything unless you're elite level
About the centurions vs invincibles argument, let me ask you this: Do the team with the most points win the premier league or the one that went undefeated? There is your answer.
You can't out banter a City fan, once you've been humbled in div 2 and worked your way back to top 8 in the prem without money, no one can say anything. Robbie thinks tough times are finishing outside the top 4. Imagine traveling the country and spending hard earned money for players like Tiatto, Weaver, Pollock or Alsop 😂 The fans deserve everything right now. You telling me, Arsenal and United fans today going through "tough times" didn't start supporting them in 1999 or the invincibles season? The only metric of "fan" should be when you started supporting the club and where they were at the time
Robbie is so childish in these videos, acting like a teenage gooner
Plastic nothing club.
Haha Robbie is delusional
What is Robbie smoking ramsdale instead of ederson 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This city fan is making me laugh about the invincibles, if city very went invincible they would go mental and a city fan mocking arsenal for not winning a European cup is comical 😂😭
Smith row better at the moment
Not a single Arsenal player gets in that City team. And the whole debate on Smith Rowe getting in over Grealish well I wouldn’t start either for City personally
People don’t realise Aston Villa built their team around Grealish and was their focal point in attack. Now at city he’s just another player in a different system. He needs time to get used to this.
As a Chelsea fan to hear Robbie say ‘Chelsea was a nobody’ lol😂 we were still winning trophies fa cups, uefa cup… when Roman wanted Chelsea other teams were jealous we won multiple trophies and Man City are the nobody’s😂 still yet to win ucl with billions spent… look at our transfer market in recent seasons no where near as outrageous as city or United🤷🏽‍♂️
Respect to the City fan hate on City when if there club could they would bite there hand off for the money trophy and player's
Smith rowe that's it who may get into City team maybe Tierney
Arsenal fans too funny want artetas head wins 4 matches and they want to shag him now he's up and down Arsenal fans gurning Arsenal history ain't good enough to over shadow how tragic they are they've nothing to smile about but try and bash other teams when they can't qualify for europa league Arsenal stadium ain't a sell out because there all on YouTube complaining
Winning the most games (City’s 100 points) is better than drawing more than 10 games. Great point by Steve,draw 38 games and get relegated it’s not good.the league is also a lot harder now then before
“We’ve been in the mud”… facts. I love city dude
I mean I’d say as of right now that Smith Rowe is performing better than Grealish, but it’s like he forgot Sterling, Foden, Jesus & Mahrez. They’re performing better right now. I’d take Ederson over Ramsdale all day everyday, lol. Saka could fill in at RW/LB if we have injuries, I guess. Don’t get me wrong, they’re still amazing players, but in my eyes the ones I said before are just better. I’d love to hear others take on this
Robbie didn’t want to answer the Wenger question the way he truly wanted to. He was one of the main one’s who drove him out of the club
The part that made be burst out laughing was: "Try getting a season ticket at city" Robbie: "u can get that tomorrow"
I'm an arsenal fan. Grealish is better than Smith rowe. Whether Smith rowe can be better than him in the future is the question. Hes the potential for sure but currently he's not. Robbie talks out of his ass at times. 🤣
arsenal had 48 trophies in their history. city on 28. but look if city grow at this rate every year they gonna get bigger than arsenal in no time. you can see kids on the street start wearing city shirt. city killing it on new young fanbase.
smith Rowe is better than Grealish
Steve got the dub
What this Man City fan saying, City where they are now because of money! Unlimited funding, even when Mancini came in, they liked to buy Arsenal players!
The Don bossed it
You can’t be a massive club if you can’t fill a stadium. PERIOD
"Not enough to put Ramsdale in net" I'm crying😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
why is Robbie acting like Arsenal are the only worldwide bigger brand? Chelsea , Utd, Real, Barcelona, Liverpool has a way wilder brand.
Tbh dunno what planet Robbie’s on LOL no player in the arsenal squad gets into the city team on form or off form don’t matter mate!
The fanbase & historic achievements is the basis for the 'Bigger Club' argument. United & Liverpool are the only bigger English clubs than Arsenal. All three have a serious die-hard following all over the world in the millions. City couldn't/didn't reach the demographic of fanatic-older supporters, as United, Liverpool & Arsenal already had the existing strong global following. The way City initially caused disruptions to the world of football by the splurging of cash didn't gain any sympathies. The only global 'fanbase', let alone nationwide 'fanbase' are kids who also support other clubs. City although were able to gain some respect/admiration by all only recently by the type of football Guardiola as them playing. But then again, Guardiola's City tenure is still so minute on English football's historical timeline.
Robbie does not know how to argue. That invicible comment from steve was stupid. The reason its invincible its cause they won the league too
City will never be bigger, u cant appear out of nowhere, win a lot beacuse of money with lil fans and then expect to have a bigge rhistroy than others
Icl man City fan is correct
Grealish is so overrated 🤣
This same argument every time. And every fan sat across from arsenal always say invincibles wasn't good because of the draws. But break it down into who's playing. Most of that invincible team were better in their individual positions then any Manchester team including centurions
Smith-roweee, are you serious? (An arsenal fan here!)
Man citys trophies were bought without passion unlike other clubs. Leicster city for example won a trophy instead of buying it. Citeh and Chelsea, you guys keep on going ruinging football but you’ll be remebered like that..
he clearly said hes been better then grealish this season not overall
Smith roe is 100% better that grelish
Centurions are better than Invincibles.
Ramsdale? Your taking the piss 🤥
In terms of popularity Arsenal is much bigger than citeh
For banter, can we get Taiwo to represent as an Arsenal fan for agree to disagree????
I would love to see an argument with ty and big steve
The invincible team is known worldwide and in every language but the 100 points of city is nowhere near that!
City & Chelsea can spend 50mil and above for a player and don’t care ever if that player will perform or not. Coz they can just buy another one the next day. It’s totally different with Arsenal, need to think for 2-3 years to think and buy a perfect players. We create stars. City & Chelsea should have academy players playing in the first team. Only one Foden and that’s it. Cmon, city can’t say anything about Arsenal as we build from scratch. This season is the only time we spend 150 mil a season, while city spending that amount every half season (almost). I was surprised when that city fans says they didnt bought the way up to win trophies. Common dude, there’s no harm on admitting it. I love fans who honest . Same as Manyoo fans , their fans can’t admit that the officials spoonfed them with advantages from Sir Alex Ferguson era till now. Everyone can see it but they just can’t be honest with themselves. Respect a fans that can be honest although it’s bitter to say it.   The only problem in Arsenal at the moment we need to kick out AFTV and the gang. They bring no benefits to our beautiful club Arsenal. They’re super TOXIC, and the fact that they self proclaimed themselves as passionate fans. What a NARCISSIST APPROACH by AFTV. There’s no logic , you support our beautiful club Arsenal but at the same time you abuse our favourite team, our own players, our Boss Arteta. AFTV is sick and should stop being toxic and make our own fans becoming toxic as you guys.   A fans like us, we support all the way. When we lost in any games, we give support to our players and making the gain their confidence again. Never ever we abuse our players although they’re not performing. For example, AFTV can love Odegaard today, and they can hate Odegaard the next day. Are you crazy? What a sick mentality you got AFTV. There’s no benefits on abusing our players dude, you only making our player’s morale drop and lost their confidence. Do you know that?   My advice to AFTV , that’s our team, our players & our Boss. Support them all the way and always think positive that our club is totally improving and learn every mistakes they did. If not us, then who gonna back up our beautiful team Arsenal??? Manyoo fans? Huh???  Please stop spreading your negative vibe anymore AFTV. Please stop from today onwards. Stop being TOXIC, stop abusing, stop giving unnecessary comments on tactical coz you never know any of footballing methods. The far you manage a team. What? Sunday league under-9 . And now you talking about what should Arteta do?? It’s not LOGIC DUDE!!!  If you can’t support your own club. Join other club then. You can abuse us all the time.   COYG!  Always have & always will ❤️
omg they got boss baby to come on for this episode
Sometimes Foden, Mahrez, Gundogan, Sterling can't get into the team and Saka and ESR that currently can't break into his own team 11 will get into ours? Haha
Good video, differing points of view which was always gonna be the case but interesting to hear from both sides
Lmao grealish is complete dogshit cares more about his legs then playing football, he's so slow aswell he slows down city so much thats why sterling is back in, grealish looked good for villa as he had average  around him as soon as he heads to a club with competition he looks bang average
What a great video  Love it
Fuck me, arsenal fans clinging onto smith Rowe like he's prime Messi. It was saka last month. Yeah there good players but nothing special. Chill out it's embarrassing
Arsenal wil always be a superior club that city fact
Put rangers v Celtic in this I’ll be the rangers side.
My guy said we will take over United, this guy is a joker
We are bigger than you now this city fan guy is Joker
Love it 😊  Proper big banter boys  It’s all a bit of fun
IM GONNA LOSE ME YOB   If you know you know
Invincible are better by far then the centurions every team who is top of the table and not lost a game always get the will they go unbeaten headline
I am a Man City Fan.. but the other Man City fans are so delusional about Grealish. Trying to compare Grealish's  first season with Mahrez & Rodri. Rodri and Mahrez had more impact than Grealiah. Just accept this L.
God Robbie is such a clown now a days, AFTV channel and money got the clowns head
Only clueless heads think or believe that grealush is not a good player. He has been great for mancity
I don't have much to say but city is just oil money that's all
Well they’re definitely not talking about shampoo.
1. Arsenal didn't go unbeaten and get relegated... they went unbeaten and won the PL so that argument is silly. 2. Huge respect for this City fan who has supported them before their takeover. Fans like him deserve the glory that came along with their takeover but the newer generation city fan can't claim success because they have not been on the journey that this man has been on.
Big Steve is hilarious🤣
Centurions will be done again in the premier league hands down..where as the invincibles will never be done again! Just stop being salty and admit it's the greatest ever domestic achievement easily😂
Invincibles will never be touched.
Centurions is more impressive than Invincible’s. Both achievements are incredible don’t get me wrong, but 100 points is next level
Tierney gets in city team
ESR is a good young player but that's it bit no way is he in the same class as grealish. No arsenal player would get into the 3 big teams.  Banter fc has the biggest deluded fan base still celebrating their gold trophy after 15 + years embarrassing
Man City will never be as big a club as arsenal??? These 2 are just arguing for the sake of arguing!!!!! The city boy has forgotten the original question and is just going off on one, and the gooner is just all about the history... If city carry on like this, in 20 years they will be the biggest club in the epl.... Ps... I do hope not.. But anyway facts are facts... Pps.. Coys
as a person from africa i kind of agree that city fans are rare while most of the citizens of my country ethiopia are arsenal fans
This city plastic needs to slow down they've been big for 10 years if that.  Copied Chelsea and bought there way...
Robbie saying it was painful for me to report on it when it came to wenger! Wenger is the reason Robbie is where he’s at today he feed of people going on aftv and bashing wenger lol. Like people will forget. He ows aftv to wenger
I don’t care what anybody says but I have to agree with that city fan.
As soon as he said saka left back I knew he was clueless
this guy is an idiot guy seriously said city is as big as arsenal they win more but in most of the world arsenal will have 1000-1 city fans at last where i live.
That emotional rant st 17:46
Maybe some of the Arsenal boys can come and fill up our stadium if they are free.
What’s the name of the tune you guys use at 0.29
I’m starting to hate Robbie
Like fan base of city is flying...I wish ronaldo or messi would have joined but it's wasn't meant to be I guess...I can u the loyalty I have for my city is impeccable...we go 2nd division or wherever I will be always there chanting We love u city we do...like hundred thousand others...💙💙
Oh my God... Arsenal fans always delusional. I don't even like city but give me a break...
Just a fact...City spend 1.2 billion in the last decade...12 major trophies...mad innit...United spend 1 billion and PSG and Barca over 900 million...just sayin
2:35 😂😂😂😂 So Damn True. Hurting Robbies Ego
Can you do Barcelona vs Real Madrid next? Not only the premier league
Arsenal , always talking about history. Lol!!!! He should live in the past! Not in the present!
The white Guy must be a paid actor, there are no such thing as a city fan
The invincibles argument is ridiculous. Yeh you could go unbeaten with only draws, but we won the League, you aren't winning the League with fewer than a certain number of points, we got them, like everybody else who's ever won the league got them, only we did it without losing a single game.
Arsenal fan but I want trophies they become historic
Man city can't care about because they didn't have it in the first place lol
Can you do Hearts fan vs a Hibs fan or Rangers fan vs a Celtic fan? Would be braw man
a team that bought the league against a team that as history and made great squads... city and chelsea are last of the big spenders before ffp and its showing now... its a joke system teams like Everton and Newcastle can't spend what they want.. pathetic..
Arsenal fan here, I have huge respect for Man City as their footballing style is similar to ours but.. Man City aren’t bigger than Arsenal. To be a big club yes you need trophies etc but more specifically you need history of success that goes back 50+ years. With all due respect to City, Chelsea, PSG and so on but these clubs haven’t won trophies on footballing merit and by that I mean playing on level turf as all the clubs around them, instead you have billionaire owners chucking hundreds of millions of pounds on their teams which essentially means buying the trophy. And that’s why your average real footballing fan does not see these clubs as a true big club.
ARSENALLLL SHOULD NOT BE TALKING ABOUT MONEY, BECAUSE IF YOU CHECK THE FACTSSS ARSENAL HAVE MORE THAN PSG, BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ARSENAL AND PSG ARE THE AMBITIONS BECAUSE IT IS CLEAR, ARSENAL ONLY CARE ABOUT TICKET SALESSSS!!!!! NOT TROPHIESSSS
Typical Manchester City fan! Small club deluded fans, small fan base
When Alex Ferguson gets brought up in a debate nothing to do with him you know he was the goat
What I came to know is city .... don't have a stadium to own imagine , the only stadium they call home is belong to Manchester city muncipal which they pay tax at the end of every year
Majority of these are biased
This was very nice , both of these men are class
So this city fan would rather city’s history over the invincibles or the 99 treble team..this is exactly what’s wrong with football fans,it’s embarrassing that he cant speak the truth..embarrassing
Steve is talking Kak Man City is not bigger than Arsenal
I’m happy they found a proper city fan for this
City fan spot on
You don't usually get relegated with 38 points though. Last time that would get you relegated was the 2010/11 season.
It’s ok if emirates has a few empty seats becuz it a big big stadium and Arsenal has been shit for a long time. But my lord😂 Citeh living their best times, yet there’s a lot of empty seats😂😂😂😆😆😆
I'm a United fan and I actually disagree with the idea that City bought their trophies. They won the financial lottery yes but there was still never any guarantees. Their transfers up until Grealish had not been marquee in the truest sense of the word. They were mostly required and well suited. They've also built the foundation and academy and instilled the idea of success into the club for generations potentially. None of these things were guaranteed initially by having a rich owner. Edit: People win the lottery every week and we know from history how that tends to go.
@DonRobbie. Call this guy for a watch along for tomorrow's game. He's funny and passionate. Love him
man said ramsdale lmao
0:57 I stopped the video right there. He talks about history like City isn't making history RIGHT NOW. That's just being incredibly shot-sighted.
Our history begun a long time ago. We won the FA cup in 1904 but people seem to forget that ha.
Great show but Robbie can't debate to save his live. Should definitely find someone else to represent Arsenal
No Arsenal player gets into that city team, i'm not even a city fan
Man City is a money team give them a owner with mediocre money and we'll see them deplete and evaporate quicker then water.  Emile smith-rowe is better then grealish, simple fact grealish was all hype 100m for what to be a headache and bench warmer
Steve is so fucking funny. 🤣
im a united fan but tbf, right now there are much more arsenal fans than city fans rn because these people grew up watching arsenal dominate english football but in future generations with city dominating the current era of english football, city will be as big as arsenal or even better than them. soon enough they would have history and fans to back their point that city are bigger than arsenal and probably other english clubs, even united
Imagine if they replaced Robbie with Ty... This would be 3 hours longer
Absolute love that passionate speech from Big Steve 💙
Saka is definitely starting on the wide right. Martenalli center forward.
That's a very soft CITIZEN
I'm an Arsenal fan, but I've never seen someone more bias than Robbie, he talks absolute nonsense, just only cares where his next pay cheque is coming from
ESR is better than Grealish this season. Arsenal is a bigger club than City of course but Citeh can overtake them in 10 years time if they carry on like this. Arsenal fans are much much bigger than Citeh fans.
Smith Rowe could never get into citys team 😂🤣😂🤣😂 cant even start got arsenal stop overhyping your shit players arsenal
Bro arsenal fans are top banter 🤣🤣🤣
Haha, Ramsdale.
38 points we would be invincible and relegated lmaooo facts on facts
You live in London talking about you can’t find City fans. Go Manchester, you’ll find plenty. Try find a gooner while you’re at it.
Just a fact, if grealish was bought for 50 million people would be talking about what a great signing he’s been so far this season.
that's steve being stubborn to strongly disagree city didnt buy there trophies, to ignore that fact is bias
Ramsdale no chance 🤣🤣
Maybe Saka over Cancelo? Cancelo one of City’s best players 😂
Robbie is a broken record.
How does smith rowe get in the Man city team when he can't even get into the arsenal team atm because of odegard? Come on Robbie hes good but he is still young
Centurions 100 point is run of the mill according to Robbie..a record never achieved before in history. These teams have two amazing records to celebrate... invincibles and centurions.
Robbie is smoking spice this episode
well city is much bigger than arsenal now
As an arsenal fan i say smith rowe is overrated  secondly, it was never the manager, it was the players at fault
Steve is hilarious
As a man united fan grealish is better than smith rowe
We won the premier league at Old trafford during prime Manchester united era , twice won the league at Sh*te hart lane. Gooners the legendary club .
it is a lie when a fan says they doesnt care if their team to go undeafeted. it is always a talking point in the mid season if a team hasnt lost “are they gonna go undeafeted?”. but ill be honest, the centurion achievement is a massive one, but the invincibles will go down in history as one of the best teams ever.
This Citeh fan would disrespect the Ashes trophy too ? It is a little trophy too . Right ?
Love the Don, really do. But big Steve done him
tbf the emirates has been pretty empty lately
I m glad knowing some arsenal fans will die without watching a champions league trophy in their cabinet 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
These videos makes no sense....
Great guy Steve very honest
Robbie has become more of a clown over the years 🤡
sonny is better
Before, it was Liverpool. Now it’s Arsenal and Man United turning the history books. You can spare United and Liverpool because their history isn’t easy to surpass but Arsenal have 0 UCLs and think they’re ahead of even Chelsea… come on lads… there is no shame in being surpassed… not everyone supports Real or Bayern or Barca… it’s fine to admit your club isn’t a big club… it’s even better because u support ur club not because it’s a big club
Most hard headed city fan in the world
City actually has more followers on Instagram than Arsenal 😂
Respect to the city fan👏👏👏
Atleast robbie's honest
both looking like humpty dumpty.... new years coming... lets go guys... cmon
I like this Man City fan he’s absolutely spot on.
Man city fan doesn't know how to debate. Not talking about opinions
This history man putting in ramsdale over ederson is just shameful.
Shout out to you Big Steve you a legend bra
Jack needs to get sold as fast as how he was bought.. the boys at city must be wondering why city is not paying each of them over a hundred million dollars because they definitely know grealish not better than any of them on the squad sheet. They must be wondering if the price tag came with being British and being less melanated.. cause he surely not worth quarter of the sum.. one of city’s worst signing as he will not work in this system he was brought in.. he makes zero crosses and less than that amount of shots per game.. all the defenders in the team have more crosses, assist and goals over him.. his stats are the worst in the team and is being payed the most.. we need to bench him and give him two to five minutes on the pitch because he is not adding to the line up.. get him loaned out or sold next time we can move him out…
What this manchester city dude talking about Gunners are bigger team than city
If Arsenal signed Grealish he’d be their best player
As an Arsenal fan myself, I love our boy Emil as much as the next man, but better than *Jack Grealish?* - Can’t say I agree sadly.
The invincibles, unbeaten. Unless you count the domestic cups and europe 😂😂😂. Jokers
gabriel magalhaes gets in as the second CB with dias
Invincibles every day of the WEEK. Go & repeat it if it’s nothing 🥴
Big up big steve
I'm a Brentford fan so I've got no place in the argument but that City fan is deluded to think they are a bigger club than Arsenal.
City are not bigger than Arsenal. I am a Liverpool fan. I have no dog in this fight. Arsenal are massive. City are not even close
We got no chance. Arteta should have breathed on everyone so that we can get the game postponed
I'm sorry but trophies isn't enough to make you a big club
The grealish obsession from opposition fans is hilarious 😂  Jack's doing just fine, he's finding his place in a new system, I think you're going to see a mahrez like progression with him
Need Ty on here😭
City are just miles ahead of Arsenal . Anybody who plays for city are gona be better plain and simple
Ramsdale 😂😂😂😂😂😂 most overrated player. Makes camera saves & everyone thinks he’s the best ever
Living in aus I have met 1 city fan, i have truely bring dead honest met more spurs fans
If this doesn't prove been a football fan makes you lose your hair and mind I don't know what does
The don
I 100% agree with arsenal fan TV on this 1
Lads we needed Sir Taiwo on this one
Smith Rowe is better than grealish
Robbie: "ederson been abit shakey this season ann'ie?" Man City: *Literally lost 2 times in the league and are top of the table*
You'll never see two balder men
How does the City Fan get away with saying "12 trophies in 10 years", then tells Robbie Arsenal have won nothing in 15 years?
Arsenals invincible team the biggest achievement & clout wasnt the fact that they won the trophy, that starting 11 is worth bragging more over... Henry, the best premier league striker of all time. With Bergkamp in behind. Viera bossing the midfield with Petit. Unbelievable set of players.
if brentford get bought out by a saudi billonaire, and in 15-20 years they have multiple PLs under their belt, are contending for the champions league every year, and are a top 3 team in the world, are they a bigger club than City or Arsenal ?
When it comes to off stats...grealish is far better than Smith Rowe.... And both especially play in a different POSITION... As well... But grealish will be a beast in city
As a Chelsea fan, what the fuck is Robbie talking about? So delusional it’s mental
They are actually the exact same person just different colors
Arsenal sell out every home and away game. FACTS
Grealish is so much better saka ain’t there yet tbh
I can’t lie this conversation is stupid I haven’t got past the ad before the vid yet
Robbie is one of the deluded guy like most of the arsenal fans.. I thought he would be biased but same as other deluded nubs..
Arsenal fans, I can’t deal with the delusion
Rn city is bigger than arsenal
Emile Smith-Rowe doesn’t even start for Arsenal how does this man have the audacity to say he’d start for Man City 😭
Pep`s a cheque book manager at an Oil club
You can't compare oil money with anything. With that much money spent , they ought to win the league.
Says “Arsenal fan” as if we don’t know who this guy is. 100%!
Why isnt he starting for Arsenal?
Saka and ESR are good players, but they absolutely do not get into the City side. They’re not even better than Foden and Grealish and they’ve been riding the bench recently…  Don Robbie is just as deluded as the fans on his channel 🤔
GET HIM ROBBIE! HIT HIM!
Robbie is deluded . The emirates is hardly ever full apart from the big games. Arsenal are probably third biggest in London after 1st Chelsea,2nd Tottenham
Man City is just gonna replace Grealish with another shiny toy next year.
Get Jamie Carragher v Tony Bellew
Like these videos what's next a Merseyside fan derby 🤣🤣🤣
This boiled egg don’t know ball 😂
If man city continues to win big titles they will eventually become a bigger club than Arsenal that's just how it would work. I would say Tierney as lb for Zinchenko and ESR would be playing for city Pep would make him better
Strange how club fans who are not winning cling to the "history" while the teams that are winning are creating it
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 arsenal better than City comment from Robbie had me dying. Maybe years ago but not anymore FACT. We will show you who's better again this weekend! Deluded FC V City
Having the highest points on the league shows the clear domination over the league arsenal werent even unbeaten  ah cah they lost in the ucl... 😭🤦‍♂️
Man city just the Saracens of football
Grown men, them
robbie is running away with this massive dub
Not a champions league trophy between them 🤣 ggmu
Agree with pretty much every word from the city fan and I support United
Give city 30yrs then they'll be a big club in terms of fans who are there for the club not just the trophies
Wenger was definitely treated appallingly by the majority of the fanbase whuch was a disgrace.. We all know he should of leave after the FA cup win but to treat him like that was shocking and will always leave a sour taste in the mouth
ARSENAL IS THE FOURTH CLUB IN ENGLAND and if City is winning the PL and UCL this year...Arsenal will be the fifth in England... United Liverpool Chelsea are much bigger than Arsenal...20 years..winning Mickey Mouse cups...the nr of fans don't make you a big club without trophies...
History is " history".You are only as good as the last trophy that you win.City' s stadium is full .judging from recent matches.Wait until tomorrow when City beat Arsenal badly.
Gabriel > laporte and stones
Most points In English football league history? This lad really needs learn football exists outside the premier league. Loon.
They look like twins
You could not only argue that, Centurions are better than invincibles but also by how much, 10% better .
As at now smith rowe is better...but grealish at aston villa was🔥🔥🔥
Ramsdale fuckin hell Robbie 😂😂
Guy said mahrez for Cam 😂😂😂
I like Steve
How can the citeh fan deny the fact that they bought the trophies? I don’t understand his justification at all
Nope
Every club buys the title
City fans are becoming deluded they think every one of their players are world class
Robbie turned into tye lol...stop embarrassing yourself bigman 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They should have invited a fan without biases to come into the conversation
Robbie got drip, always got new js
ESM is not a starter at arsenal how would he start at city? 😅😂😂
as a mancity fan i totally agree with rob, smith rowe has been a better player than grealish this season
Robbies been smoking to much skunk...smith row and saka 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.I'm wetting myself
Man City fan,that realy exist? 😂😂😂😂
Its not a bad thing but city bought their trophies
Groundbreaking piece of work here
Martinelli would get into a man city team
Never seen a City Fan this passionate I respect you and not them schoolboys 👍🏾
Man City is already a bigger club then arsenal
Robbie really said oh we actually found one 😂😂😂🤣
Toxic
City fan here, the blue is bang on.  We see things they’ll never see  Mcfc Manchesters Only 🏆🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
No arsenal player could get in the city team facts there shit
City have been the better run club for years, Arsenal is finished
I think a fair thing to do to decide which was better between The Invincibles and The Centurions, is doing a combined XI. Here is mine:  Formation: 4-4-2 GK: Ederson  RB: Kyle Walker CB: Vincent Kompany & Sol Campbell LB: Ashley Cole CDM: Fernandinho CM: Patrick Vieira AM: David Silva & Kevin De Bruyne ST: Thierry Henry & Dennis Bergkamp  Man City Players: 6 Arsenal Players: 5  It was close but I think Centurions had more versatility to win games!
Just look at the stats, this season smith rowe has been a far better player than grealish it’s just a fact
When its the last time the big club Arsenal won a title I don't remember they in the mud 4 a while 😂😂😂 Man.City won 5times the title in the last 10years that says a lot...
talk about experience, grealish won. talk about performance, rowe won.
Sagna Clichy Nasri toure adebeyor all went to a smaller club hahahaha
AFTV truly did poop all over Arsene Wenger. Robbie should just accept this. No need to make excuses and justifications.
As a fan of neither club this is gold.
City football club can buy 100 arsenal...u can't deny that
Aaron Ramsdale over Ederson?!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
Most arrogant Man City fan I have ever seen.
Remember Mancity bought all of Arsenal Players we were so much better than them...
Ramsdale,Gabriel,Smite-Rowe,Tierney/Tavares/Saka and Partey and Martinelli all would get into Man City's Team...
That City guy reminds me of Ethan from the Sidemen but bald.
How did Wobbie not mention Gabriel in man city strongest 11?? Hes a banker
Arsenal for all their history never dominated a period. It was Liverpool in the 70's and 80's. United in 90's and 2000's. And City from 2011 till now.
Getting 38 draws won't get you a gold PL. Too much disrespect. Easier to get centurions when you have won the league, harder to get invincibles when you have won the league. Ask liverpool
I love fans like thia guy pizza drinks n girls while futbol being argued but the guy to much man 🤣🤣🤣🤣 he knows how to  fix his convo  but arsenal will always b great bro even if city win 100 trophys
Robbie u shud debate with this guy each week i njoyed it he ia very bold
Robbie shouldn't be representing Arsenal fan base. He embarrassed Arsenal, himself and Arsenal fans.
smith rowe is shit. you all we see that tomorrow
Ramsdale is not 1/2 ederson
I think this just proves no matter who you support if you are from Manchester you sound like a knob. Banter welcome.
The thing is, City got big because of money. And Newcastle will follow their steps soon.
22 major trophies ( community shield not included) for City but only 8 won prior to Arab takeover.The last trophy they won before the money came in was a league cup in 1976.They might be a currently successful club but have a way to go to be as big a club as Arsenal.End of.😁
Arsenal..there is going to be a massacre...
respect to city , arsenal defs a banter club
Smith-Rowe over Grealish all day. Mount over them both.
All 5 man city fans agree
Smith Rowe>Grealish
Don robbie was way more realistic than this egghead. Coming in and saying that city is a bigger club than Arsenal. And then on top strongly disagreeing that city haven't baught their success😂😂. In 12 years they have spent more than Wenger and Ferguson combined and they still havent won a cl
On current form yes, but overall no I still think Grealish is better.
Robbie doesn’t represent a realist Arsenal fan
That Invincible season, Charlton, Birmingham, Fulham and Bolton all finished top 10. No way that Arsenal side goes invincible in the league last few season.  The standard of the league was weaker than now. Is a great achievement. But not the greatest.
from a united fan, i think city are writing their history right now, in a matter of years, i have a feeling they will end up a big club
People who disrespect the Invincibles make me laugh. The argument “you can go invincible and get relegated” is stupid because when has that ever happened lol. We didn’t lose a game and won the league, respect respect!
Saka definitely wouldn't get into the city squad. He's a bigger fanny than sterling ever was. Smith-Rowe has shined this season but you can't judge a player on one season (although I would take him to the WC over rashford but not grealish) Ramsdale is an absolute beast and I believe he is on par with ederson and I would choose him over pickford for England (if I had ederson and ramsdale they would have to share priority for games)
Why do I only hear Robbie talk about the past on these videos? I agree that Arsenal, historically, have one over almost any club in England, but nowadays, history dosent matter. We’ve seen TikTok creators gain tens of millions of followers within a year, forget about old vines on YouTube. Why can’t it be similiar with football? I know that it goes deeper than trophies and performances but I think that Manchester City are and will be for the near future, the best club in the world.
those beers are lonely
https://youtu.be/X2gpXvKG2B4
It's embarrassing that we are pretending aftv are arsenal fans
The most annoying argument Arsenal fans make is that the ‘Invincibles’ were the best premier league team ever. They all just blindly accept it. Going a season unbeaten is very very impressive. However, it doesn’t make a team objectively better than another team who achieved significantly more points like City 17/18, Chelsea 05/06, or the United teams of 99-01 & 07-09 who won 3 back to back titles (another even harder achiever than. The best team is the team who wins the most points, not the one who necessarily loses the fewest games. It’s basic common sense. Henry was for me the best player I’ve ever seen in the premier league, so it’s not a ‘fuck Arsenal’ thing.. but being objective.. the invincibles were a great team who made a very impressive achievement, but they were nowhere near the best Premier League team of all time, and certainly not better than the City Centurions.
Respect for my city fan lad 💙
Two bald guys wearing jerseys having a heated argument!   That's worthwhile wasted time
I love Robbie but for him to “sit on the fence” with the Wenger issue is disgraceful. Wenger took Arsenal to the heights they are now known for. And he was abused week in week out, sometimes personally, on Robbie’s platform. The same fans are now wishing for the team to achieve what Wenger was achieving every season.
Credit to City for everything they’ve done. People seem to forget Man Utd have spent a similar amount of money and have got nothing to show for it. Arsenal and City are at very different stages at the moment. But if you compare Arsenal’s golden era team with City’s, Arsenal dominated with pretty much the same team whereas City have added a lot of players season after season.
Decent watch up until Robbie didnt man up on aftv treatment of Wenger.  Wenger owned up to staying too long but Robbie cant own up to going too far with his treatment of Wenger amd AFTV fostering the negativity for clicks and embarassment.
Arsenal is obviously a bigger club than City for the time being. 20, 30 years down the road the way it’s going, different story
Robbie saying emirates is full 🤢🤢
Smith Rowe is 5 years younger. At 21, ESR is miles ahead of where Grealish was at 21.   In ESR and Saka, we have two great players
The Man City guy is quite reasonable and fair but he didn't really answer the last question. It's ok to love what Man City had achieved and still acknowledge that they bought all of it. Every fans in the world will take that as well, there's no shame in admitting that.  Also, Smith Rowe is playing better than Grealish.
Should just rename these videos robbie chats shit
These City “Fans“ 🤦🏼‍♂️
"m8, I'm a fokin sellout and I don't give a fok!".
Out of all the big six arguments man city and arsenal arguments are the most fairness arguments ever
City are making their history now, regardless of how they got here. if Arsenal fall into complete irrelevancy then yeah they’ll be bigger.
As an arsenal fan this guy's hilarious we do we need someone to carry the water bottles
Steve is the funniest
This city fan 😂😂😂😂 what a spanner 🔧
Arsenal aren’t even invited to the party😂😂not been there for like 15+ years😂😂
Not gonna lie both of their arguments have strong facts to back their club
9:07 60, kepa was 75
as a city fan i can comfirm  jack grealis is so bad and smith rowe is better
100 Anime Openings You Can't Skip #3 (Male Singer) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNGonO8ja0&ab_channel=Kurowolf
City have spent an incredible amount of money and wouldn't be anywhere near where they are now without it. But i refuse to believe that if every club in the premiership was given that amount of money to spend over the period city have spent it for example, not many would reach the heights they have. Everton are a good example of why spending loads of money means does nothing if its not done correctly. United have spent plenty as well, and whilst they've still competed and europe and won a couple of trophies under mourinho, they are no where near to city. City have an incredible sructure to their club, great youth system with proven gems like foden, and have built legends in toure, silva, aguero and kompany. People can say "you bought it all" and yeh, too right they did. they've invested the money brilliantly, play the best football and win the biggest trophies. Had guardiola not bottled it in european games they would've won the UCL by now, which would've left no one to question his legacy, no that it should be considering how good they are. they were always going to have to spend money to lift them out of mid table, let alone even more to get them to the top of it. One other thing is that they've never fallen away from competing at the top. Its happened to united since sir alex, to chelsea when they've sacked countless managers and liverpool for a long period of mediocrity. Arsenal are the best example though, poorly run ever since they moved to the emirates, money may not have been in their control at all times, especially under wenger, but city really could be their template. A powerhouse in english football that wants to play possesion and show why its called the beautiful game. theyve done well this season and its great to see young players lke saka and smith rowe performing so well, thats what arsenal should be.
I hate city but the city fan was the only one speaking with facts and not being to biased towards his side.
Yes smith Rowe is much better than grealish a million time ,and that's from a Bayern's Munich fan ,
“You ain’t even the biggest club in Manchester relax” acting like arsenal are best in London 🤨
People dont realise that Arsenal Is in fact a very very rich club, they are the most expensive english club. They are known around the world and charge fans ridiculous amounts  The only difference is man city spend their money
Grealish just 'falls down' when anyone gets near to him! Great actor! ESR is the real deal! COYG!
I'm an Arsenal fan but Smith Rowe doesn't even get into our team, how tf is he getting into Citys LMFAO
I love big steve. He's really funny.
Robbie saying they lost 1 game the season before they went invincible? They lost 6?
Cut Grealish some slack Jesus everyone was loving the man a few months ago
The respect that SAF still gets from rival fans says it all.
I beg somebody gets Expressions Oozing on here with Robbie 😂
The arrogance of this city fan, my lord. Wouldn’t have thought these lot were struggling at the bottom a couple decades ago.
What makes a big club is the fan base without fans football is notting
Arsenal Fan here ...3-1 to City...we just need to play with passion and grit. I hope we get a draw against City on Saturday..
Centurions and invincibles in the league at the same time city win the league no questions
Man utd are bigger then both of them combined.
Player for player the invincible team was better. Also i think a few players could push for a place in citys lineup. Ramsdale, Gabriel, tierney, saka, esr, martinelli, odegard. I’m not saying any of them would walk into the team but they could definitely challenge for a starting spot
Emile smith Rowe in man city’s team is scraping the bench let’s be honest
Arsenal fans really do be clinging onto that invincibles season
Some dead lager
big up steve, that's a real one
Ramsdale? really? what are u smoking bro
This was unfair, the arsenal fan got annihilated in this
Yo city where's you UCL trophy your on about how good yur team is but still they carnt get there hands on European Glory 😂🤡
I’m a city fan and I would take ESR over Grealish any day of the week. Grealish has been terrible. I know he will get better, but he’s absolutely terrible now…
Just be quiet !
The first minute started so nice, and then fireworks hahah
The disrespect on Saka
English Players are overrated The only real deal English player is Phil Foden
remove pep city will be shit...thats all i gotta say
Likewise you can be centrurions and not win the league. Invincibles all the way.
It’s undeniable ESR has been better than grealish this season
You do know that Robbie doesnt speak for all Arsenal fans? How about get other Arsenal youtubers on that arent deluded and biased?
Looking at the present, you can’t dismiss Man City it’s a top club from the quality players they have, trophies and creating a system that’s creating their success it’s not possible to say they are not a big club. Arsenal haven’t been for years and yes the history cemented them as a great they need to work to start winning titles then talk about the past
Arsenal 1 loss over two seasons? Where on earth did that come from?
why dont they drink their beer?
hes got  a point about grealish tbf coz he hasn't turned up yet and emile smith rowe has turned up but regardless i think grealish has got a lot more to give
Ramsdale is nearly as overrated as maguire he’s made one decent save (against Leicester) and that was near middle of goal save only looked good cause his positioning was poor 😂
Samir Nasri
Smith Rowe is better than grealish
Robbie actually buried him in the first 5 min
Man was making fun about Liverpool spending 75 on Alisson Becker.😂 at least alisson won the champions-league
We have found the one and only man city fan.
Big clubs have done it though out their history like the 1920s 1930s 1940s 1950s 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s not just turn up with a few quid
This Manchester fan is deluded. Smith Rowe is carrying and has been carrying Arsenal as well as Saka, Grealish can’t turn up for a big club yet Saka and Smith Rowe is running rampant through the premier league without oil money.
Sorry but manchester city have always been a bigger club than arsenal if you're counting the entire history
Robbie knowledgr in football is shocking tbh
Big up big steve him n the other steve and city Xtra flying the blues flag 💙💙  For all those city have no history idiots. Being relegated, taking 30-40 thousand to games in division 2, getting taken over, that's part of citys history just because a club has won more/less trophies doesn't mean they dont have any history #UPTHEBLUES💙 #CITYTODEFENDTHEPREM 🏆
That city fan is jarring 🥱
Any season Smithrowe is better than Grealish
Let's keep it a buck 50... Sheikh Mansour thought he bought 'UTD ' ***NOT!!!*** ' CITY' Hence 19:19
It’s close between 100pt and invincible teams. Why Robbie always go on like arsenal won every game that season.
This current man city team is better than the Centurian... That team had weaknesses this doesn't
Arsenal are big club than man city
This Arsenal fan is a divvy
Yeah but they didnt draw 38 games did they? 100 points or 79 points winnings winning
Diabetes
I’m with City on this one
this white cadaan boldy talks so much shit lmao
city were nothing before money, whats he on about
Robbie just speaking bogus..EAR better than Grealish nonsense
I'm more bothered that they are not drinking thier pints.  Absolute disgrace!
Lol he thought the trophy wenger was given was the real invincible trophy
The city fan was class. Should be on more city related videos. Properly represents our fan base
Grelish is the most overrated English player I can think of. I can’t remember a player being so overhyped because they get fouled? What sort of BS stat actually is that. ESR was free, JG was 80 million too much. Not even a contest
I know Robbie makes it easy these days but this Steve fella verbally destroyed him in every way. “You can keep all that shit” HA! - Robbie talks about history but I don’t remember City buying their way out of relegation like the old Woolwich Arsenal, literally did.   Talks a lot does Rob about “you spent this and bought that, money spent well” but has he ever thought about money spent badly? Because Arsenal have got more than enough examples of money spent poorly over the last 10-15yrs!   Used to rate Robbie as a voice of reason, but maybe over on AFTV that’s an easy sell to fool people. These series vs other fans have just shown how delusional he really is.   Respect the City fan just telling it straight up. Robbie must have made enough YouTube monies to save himself and just slink off now rather than further come up looking a clown in what he says.   The bit where he was like “we’ll be back.” was probably as funny as trying to claim Ramsdale could get in City’s team!     I think this series needs to sub out its Arsenal fan as there are far more honest who don’t come across as narrow minded as Robbie… listening to him makes Arsenal fans sound like the new Liverpool fans when they went 30yrs with no Premier League. Talked about “history” and “big club” but they still won Champions Leagues in that time frame!   Arsenal fans sounding real one dimensional talking about 2004. In reality there’s probably 3 or 4, maybe 5 Premier League title winning teams since then that were better than the buzz word tag line “invincible.”
he says he doesnt care about whos the bigger club, then goes onto to argue to city are bigger?   Theyre better right now and have been fro 8-10 years, but wont be bigger until what they have done in the last few years becomes history
“You ain’t even biggest team in Manchester” I closed my MacBook 👏🤣😂
If city win the UCL they’re bigger than Assnal facts
City were Est in 2012 👍
The city fan seems classless taking everything to heart trying to hurt feelings, arsenal fan oozes class and ok with going with the light banter
Better then grealish lmao yeah right
Who this dart player up in here
Pep and the players wanted the unbeaten record not getting 100 points!
Google invincibles then centurions, shows nobody cares about city. If ESR, Saka, Odegaard, Gabriel and Tierney were in the city squad, they would all rotate in but who doesn’t rotate in the city team? City are the result of a football team being treated very well whereas arsenal are the opposite. But in the end, I do respect city bc even tho they did buy it all, they do it smartly which Chelsea and Newcastle should learn from. Hopefully in a few years, we’ll be competing with them for the big honours
Smith rowe has been much better than grealish so far this season don't care what anyone says. The stats speak for themselves!
Arsenal fans really are the gift that keeps on giving
Is this the most deluded City fan? i can only imagine the rest of the city fanbase portend they don't know him lol
City got no fans, and fans are what make a big club, end of story
Embarrassing. Aftv trying to stay relevant.
That city fan is a right bellend
Robbie is delusional, big club don't behave like Arsenal.
Deluded arsenal fan 😂 any one with common sense knows that Man City are taking over right now
Steve repressing Manny! OG City fan! WWW!
It’s tough listening to Robbie sometimes, has to be louder than anyone else and can’t take criticism. Rowe has been better than Grealish, but Grealish isn’t in the top 3 attacking mids there, debruyne silva foden gundogan. Then fucking Ramsdale 😂 maddest thing is tho, he genuinely believes ramsdale is better 😂😂
I think most Arsenal fans would swap the invinsibles season for a champions league trophy
The arrogance of this city fan is why I can't wait till the mighty GUN rises again!
I hate a lot of the guys on aftv like Troopz but I love don Robbie and always will
Strongly disagree that city bought their trophies??? Wtf
2 bald beasts
Smith Rowe actually did well against city when we lost 5-0 this guy saying smith rowe would get fined out lol wtf?🤣 the kid is one of the most intelligent players in the league just look at his passing and movement
please i beg stop getting robbie to represent arsenal
Finally we see the white Robby
At this point i agree smith rowe > grealish this season coming from a brighton fan
Robbie’s a disgrace, he lapped it up when the fans criticized Wenger, he profited from it!!
Ederson hasn't proven anything he's just a keeper in a good team that hardly get passed by, Ragsdale has proven more on a keeping statistics, look how easily crystal palace beaten them, there weren't no awesome untouchable goals
I'm a die hard man city fan and I can completely agree with Robbie I'll take smith row over grelish any day
And Arsenal never spent money they got all their players for free according to Robbie
Yes steve 👏 🙌
Robbie needs to be honest,Arsenal fans were a disgrace at the end just be honest for fucks sake.
That speech by the blue at the end 👏🏻
Bro fucking Arsenal have been shit in 11 years now and city Are on another level, and yeah Arsenal have their history but city will become a bigger club
I agree city bought their trophies, so did Chelsea , psg, Bayern, Barca and RMadrid  in the last 15 years. . Pretty soon Newcastle too but I don’t see why that is a bad thing. Clubs need to spent a lot of money so they can win a title.  Barca is in debt and they still trying to spend money.
Big Steve and don robbie are real life brothers
City fan is unbearable
I get it that City have deep pockets but fans of the other top six going on like they have a squad full of free transfers and haven't been dropping £75M on players of their own.
Ksi vs W2s in 40 years
Big Steve 😂😅😅
Robbie wasn't making any good arguments he was just being salty
COYG
Im an Arsenal fan but nah robbie sounded like TY and Julian there 1000% reckon he had too many beers before this 🤣
My turn
The two baldies
I can't lie, as a City fan, this guy is really representing us well. He has a logical reply to everything Robbie throws at him.
Wonder if Arsenal fans will ever stop banging on about that gold plated trophy and the invincible team. Kinell they bore the pants off everyone with it 🙄 They make it sound like they were unstoppable they drew 12 times that season and lost both games in the cups. I’d rather win the champions league all day long and we’ve won it six times. Neither of these have won it once.
Arse bought there success in 2ooos Danny the jeweller put 50 million in so Robbie waken up
Smith Rowe would struggle to get in our women's team
Arse aren't even no 1 in London no4
This is a typical City fan.
This season yes
Both couldn't run for a bus.
7.      26.      34
A ridiculous comment. Smith Rowe has made a good start to his career, that is it.
The Don on the verge of tears at the end lmao good speech though
From an Arsenal fan we both can agree that the only thing mising for both clubs is the champions league trophy. We just cant digest why both clubs in their prime just didnt & dont have the ability to win it. Mind blowing 🔴⚪️
I never understood how someone could be a hardcore fan of anything. I mean you aren’t playing so technically you didn’t win anything if that club won something.
A BIG CLUB? Usually a team that has lots of fans from Africa and Asia on the Internet,  oh and they win no trophies currently? They're all very jealous of the champions Manchester City.
Why didn’t he say tierney
as a eason ticket holder for 48 years  at mcfc so history mcfc  1894   gunners 1886. in 1934 city v stoke was the highest recorded attendance at a domestic football ground 84,569 An attendance of 84,569 packed into Maine Road, the largest attendance at an English football match on the commonwealth  stadium    simple the only team with the manchester coat of arms on the stadium  eg maine road was city.  so city pay there rates to manchester council united pay there rates to trafford council . so the council had one option knock it down or let city use it for a nice rent deal to put back in to infrastructure for the people of manchester der robble  i could go on and on oh on the staduim city pay more than the council agreed because they can mcfc trillionaires and we are loving it
on the invincibles if pep said  dont lose if we win we win then city would be that  invincible crap
who said arsenal dont have emty seats looooooooooooooooooooooooooool   everytime i see the side its spot the person i remember going just after we beat them in the fa cup . there was more of us there
Robbie is having a laugh , arsenal sell out every week, that Corona virus , must have done something to his eye sight
Cmon citehhhh
Come on!! you've got to have won the champions league at least 4 times to be considered a big club
It honestly pisses me of the way arsenal fans behaved about arsene wenger disgusting seen so many people spitting at his car saying vile things to him and thats there most successful manger
We know he’s the main Arsenal guy hit he’s annoying
Arsenal are not even that big of a club, no Champions league ever🤣🤣
Arsenal fan here - no Arsenal player would make the City starting 11.
Robbie's not wrong. I would pick my nan over Grealish.
The arrogance of the city fan is why people don't like Mancs.
Fair point from each side. I think only ramsdale would actually have a direct Chance at the first 11, nobody else. The invincibles season was a greater achievement than the centurions.
When your manager has ask fans to attend home games, you are not a big club.
Robbie waffling as usual
Tierney LB
We had Smith Rowe @ Huddersfield (on loan) a few years ago and he was brilliant, good luck to him 👍
LADBIBLE - PLEASE STOP USING ROBBIE TO REPRESENT ARSENAL FANS!!! WE FUCKING HATE HIM
man city still cant fill there stadium
Centurions, run of the mill thing 🤣🤣🤣 Robbie was smoking some serious stuff. Good chat but slightly disappointed with Robbie's empty seat jibes and blatantly lying regarding empty seats at the Emirates!
Ramsdale over Ederson hahahahah
He says Liverpool spent 75 on ALISSON as of he isnt better than ederson
Luckily for City football  started with the Premier League......oh wait it didn't did it 🤣🤣🤣
Manchester United, Liverpool & Arsenal are the biggest clubs in the PL. West Ham are a bigger club than Tottenham and have better players… agree?
Only man getting in that City squad is Aubameyang... Pep always wanted him
Robbie needs to chill haha g
I think this is the best agree to disagree
city will never have the same legacy as arsenal did also arsenals invincible season i think is the most amazing thing to happen in england as they did it with very little spending money
Gotta be the ugliest pair of supporters I’ve ever witnessed inc The Wealstone Geezer 🙈🤷🏼‍♂️
Big Steve the legend
Am the only one who hates when football fans act as if there best mates with the manager and start talking about what the club needs as if they are in the dressing room on a consistent basis. This Man City fan does it the whole time and just sounds like a prick.   Also ManCity always will be a tiny club built off oil 💰.
Smith rowe is clear of grealish
Anyone else worried about the beers getting warm? Drinkin them dammit!
How many different teams have got 100pts in English football? One city, there are two invincibles and one is Preston 😂😂
City probably wouldn't be in the tip flight now without the money and this moron said they aint buy the trophies
City have a average attendance of 53k when the max is 54k so this nonstop shite about empty is crap!! When I go i see a lot of corporate seats empty. Doesn’t matter if it’s empty the seats been paid for
No arsenal player gets in
Soon as he said Saka at left back he lost all credibility, what a terrible take man knows no ball
First of all, what makes a big club bigger, history, achievements, fan base world wide yes man City they're on the right track but Arsenal is still way bigger than them
Everyone is better than Grealish.
Robbie took the L here
Man City fans come out of their shells when they have all this money really hope we beat city Saturday and shut those glory hunters up
City the best club all time
Now I hope u city fans from a Chelsea fan. understand  "u bought it" all we ever heard. Can't be used no more.  And what arsenal fans forget when stan came in....... He had more money then Roman. but no arsenal fans talk about that so it's with chelsea n city . "U bought it". No no arsenal tried to buy it along with Chelsea but it never worked out it went tits up.
i'm an arsenal fan but i think as football fans we have to stop with the "city bought trophies thing" because if the president id willing to spend that's good. if we continue in that logic so real madrid bought their trophies also... so yeah that's my point of view
Typical Deluded City Fan
CITY WILL NEVER BE BIGGER THAN ARSENAL!!!!!!!!!
Not even one Arsenal player makes the city bench 🤣
The Don Robbie is always right, even if hes wrong
You aint even the biggest club in Manchester.
I agree with the fact that Arsenal is currently a bigger club in comparison to city. But its ignorant to say that City will NEVER be bigger or as big as arsenal. The history argument is true, but if city consistently win trophies or more trophies than arsenal for years to come, the stature of the club will be similar to Arsenal. History has to start somewhere. Ask this question in 10-20 years from now.
the west ham one is still the best. why can't any of these guys ever be remotely reasonable
Invincible not winning the league would be pointless. But they did losing zero times in the most competitive league.unlikely to repeat in decades. No one can bring draws up because they didnt lose hence invincible title given by all others. It didnt say win 38. No one could draw 38 but if got relegated then it would be pathetic so it be amazing and hilarious combined. But this was invincible winning the league.city haven't done this under pep but if win league it irrelevant in the main.
There hot dogs are fucking unreal
Mancity a million times better than arsenal is the only comparison with any value. Serial winners city v banter afc struggling to get any European footy.im an arsenal fan but this title is so daft it is laughable.city own arsenal even if arsenal win one game this doesn't mean anything as the points gap shows how poor arsenal are and their goal difference🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Arsenal are not back Robbie talking rubbish they’ve had a good first half of the season but could still finish 7th or 8th yet Robbie needs to stop overhyping arsenal and the youngsters Robbie was just talking rubbish here and got embarrassed by steve who was actually saying facts.
Don’t be silly !! Arsenal fans are sooooo delusional to think smith Rowe is better. The disrespect
City fans got small man syndrome
Man said keep the treble, I've had the aguero moment and 6-1 at Old Trafford. Hahahhaha absolute rubbish mate. United have conquered Europe and the world Mate. you know no boundaries outside of England.
Ohh dear. Robbie been on the old rastafarian marbloros again 🚬🚭
Robbie talks about buying the league ... Arsenal finished 8th the last two seasons and spend THE MOST last summer and are performing  better now. But City buy the league lol
Jacks not a wide left player??? huh?
Do not disagree with the Don, you'll have your comeuppance.
Smith rowe > grealish anyday of the week
Gabriel
Robbie is a fat blacker version of Tye. Delusion is genuinely remarkable
Man city fan spoke facts there at the end, 💙💙💙
ManCity plastic team. They bought every title. Petrol football club.
the villa grealish, yes. the man city grealish, no chance.
I think the one argument steve lost was the invincible talk
Now do man united fan vs man City fan
Robbie like 99% is completely delusional it’s so irritating. It’s like being an Assnal fan comes with a delusion clause in the contract 🤡🤡🤡 unbearable them lot
Wait smith-rowe has been miles ahead of Grealish THIS season
No matter how good City are, they will never reach ManU and Arsenal’s level.
Celtic’s invincible side would’ve slapped arsenal’s
The way I see it I am also an arsenal fan and city are amazing and they are now what arsenal used to be the best way to look at it is  In 2003/04 arsenal had the invincible team  In 2021/22 man city have a champion winning team like arsenal and the sad truth is things to do change in life but that doesn't mean whatever happened in the past will be forgotten or not respected because it will hence why arsenal are a legendary club but now it's up to city to shine that's what I think
Is there a shout for Tierny getting a game for city?
Smith Rowe has 8 goals and 2 assists this season. Grealish has 2 goals and 2 assists playing for Man City. How can anyone say Grealish was better than Smith Rowe this season.
If the invisibles team and the centurions played at the same time, same season, tell me which accomplishment is better? Cmon city!
Aftv is the main reason why Wenger was abused and hounded out and the rest is history.
I don’t support either teams what so ever and I think anyone can agree Man City are much better then arsenal 😂
Rodri, Cancelo, Sane… are just a few players who struggled in their first season give Grealish time
City talking about bigger club than Arsenal... They were unknown 15 years ago. Got lucky cause a Billionare decided to buy them. Its not hard to win something if go and buy the best manager and the best players. They literally have got two first team squads.
Big love to Big Steve, as a fellow Manchester Blue since 1984. I had to laugh when Robbie suggested Ramsdale over Ederson, c’mon that’s just ridiculous, Ederson is the best keeper in the premier league
This City guy does my nut in, literally clueless
I hate arrogant fans like this honestly.
man said we bought trophies. like arsenal didnt buy henry, bergkamp,pires and so many others
This is so set up
This whole thing that ‘Arsenal have won no trophies in 10 years’ is complete bull though isn’t it.. it’s just a false belief due to the 9 year gap we had. We’ve won 4 FA cups on the last 7 years
He made a good point about the invincible’s. Come from a United fan.
Typical city fan, im fed up with these plastic fans!
"When you walk around the world, there are Arsenal fans everywhere." "Who cares about that?"   That's what a big club is. 😂
Why didn't he show up when they beat them 5-0 Weaker squad Depleted team Down to ten men Shall I go on?...
Grealish needs to adapt
Interesting debate. ARSENAL and Manchester City are great clubs. Arsenal rocks 🪨 🎸 😎 🙌 👌 👏.
Arsenal do not sell out and thats a fact
Citeh fans are the worst, literally most unlikeable people around
Robbie should’ve brought up the Striker position, I think Lacazette or Martinelli would get into City’s #9 slot
Arsenal - the 'bank of England' club - a real term used to describe Arsenal for decades. Their unparalleled wealth at the time powered them to their most successful decade as a club bar none in the 1930's (unfortunately the war brought this to an end). Why do Arsenal supporters diminish the achievements of City and Chelsea because their influx of wealth just so happens to have occurred more recently? The vast amounts of money that Arsenal had in the late 20's and 30's relative to other clubs is what got them the success at the time and what the club has been built on - in the same way that the future and also the current successes of Chelsea and Manchester City is built on wealth.   Another point to mention about money and success when it comes to Arsenal is that previous to the first world war, they were in the second division and had failed to gain promotion the year before the league was suspended on account of the war. When the football league resumed, they were put in the first division because they paid to leapfrog the teams that finished above them in the final pre-war season and the other candidates. Who knows where Arsenal would be now if they had to earn their way into the first division instead of paying for it that year - it's plausible that they may have gone the same way as Barnsley (who had finished 3rd while Arsenal had finished 6th in the 1914-15 season) who only found their way into the top flight almost 80 years later in the 90's.   At the end of the day, however, all of this is what happened, but it does not take away from the success of any of the Arsenal teams like Arsenal fans love to claim it does with Manchester City and Chelsea - I'm still amazed they have so little knowledge of their own club to use it as an argument though; stones and glasshouses come to mind.
I don't think city will ever be as big a club as Arsenal, successful yea but big in terms of fan interest and worldwide fan totals? It's possible but very unlikely. City struggle to build a fan base outside of England atm, I don't see that just suddenly changing. They have international fans but not to the extent of the Arsenal. And I think that does have a lot to do with history.
Grealish £100 mill 😂😂🤣 he’s poor he can’t handle it and as it shows when he was at villa he looked good because villa are shit and now he’s at Man City he’s shocking he’s worth £35 -£50 mill max smith Rowe is way better and saka aswell defo better and I don’t support either of these teams aswell
City are nothing without their owner. Mansour City.
As an Arsenal fan I like Robbie and AFTV but none of our players starting for city’s team lol. They might make the bench.
No Arsenal player gets in.
Robbie is absolutely nuts the way he overrated Arsenal players.
One simply cannot debate against the Don Robbie and win.
Grealish is trash! They paid £100 mil LOL!  He's a £10m - 15m player
I wish wenger stayed
That Man City guy is very biased 🤣
I don't think the invincibles would touch the ball against Centurian city
“Chelsea were nobody even in London”   Yet, Chelsea won an European trophy before the takeover. Total and absolute delusion
Robbie GOT Ruined
White version of Robbie. I love it
Hey it's a ManchestVAR City Fan I wonder when his club will play the Oil Clásico
Arsenal have more prem trophys than city wtf is this guy talkin abt
City won the domestic treble in 2018/19 I think that is a bigger achievement than the Invincibles
He just makes me hate Man City more
Arsenal and United can only bring “history” to the table anymore. It's a competitive sport not a history lesson
Ramsdale OVER Ederson ..  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
this ones not even a debate to be fair. Out scored and produced him even through injury and coming off the bench sometimes
Robbie been hanging around ty too much
Grealish is also playing in a team amongst some of the worlds best players whereas smith Rowe is playing in a decent premier league team. It’s much harder for grealish to stand out - I’m sure if he was playing for arsenal right now he would be doing more than ESR is currently.
Robbie thinks arsenal lost one game in two seasons? Whoah
Loll the Don sounds so poker faced in the intro but trying to control laughter
Ramsdale over Ederson? are you tapped?
This city fan is unbearable. Oil money out the way you’re nada. Show some humility
How are they not drinking those pints?
Grealish is a better player however hes out of form and smith rowe is playing better atm
This is comedy gold
My goal is to become a manger and draw every single game in the prem so Arsenal fans can shut up about the invincible season I swear Robbie pays these man to say something about the invincibles so he can have fun as an Arsenal fan for 20 mins b4 it’s back to the shite
I bet Nasri, Sagna and Clichy could get into Cities team...ohhhh wait 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm no Arsenal fan but no trophies in 15 years? Does the FA cup not exist?
Smith Rowe isn’t even as good as Connor Gallagher. Let’s be real.
Bigsteve is so funny
Seriously if I have never met a city fan. But met a lot of arsenal fans
Robbie is SO delusional 😂.
Really enjoyed the City fan
what's the point of winning stuff, if you've got no global fans lol
Robbie spitting
This is why u can’t talk football with arsenal fans
Nah cmon everyone knows Arsenal can’t fill a stadium 😭😭
I don’t get how smith Rowe gets into the best team in the world like how the only place available is 9 but he’s not a 9
I don't actually watch, or know much about football, but I love these videos, because each man is willing to die on their own respective hill so hard.
Nice to see 2 fans that are honest & aren't fully deluded to just make an argument
⚠️ This is why arsenal fans gets abused 🤦🏼‍♂️☝️  ramsdale ! smith-rowe ! half a season and they truely believe then players could get inti man city side !!  Its not even worth a debate its just stupid & laughable that they actually believe it.
Lets all be honest. It will take Man City a very, very long time to reach the size of Man Utd, Liverpool or Arsenal. You can go anywhere in the world and see fans wearing those shirts, while is not common to see a fan wearing a city shirt outside of Manchester and possibly UAE. Creating a legacy is about much more than winning trophies. The teams above may not win all the time but they have consistently dined at the top table for 50/60 years, and thats why they are the biggest clubs in the land. Giggs won 30 domestic trophies (which is actually a madness), while Maradona won 7. One is a legend of Man United, while one is a legend of Football.
having 100 points is better than being invincible...yes it does bcm more iconic(not denying that getting 100 points isnt iconic) but practically having 100 points is better
It’s delusional to think a Arsenal player can get into the city team
Wallahi ESR is better than Grealish. No argument
When the man city fan walked in i just knew instantly just by looking at his face that he was delusional
Always hated man city  since they they beat Gillingham in the 2nd division play off final 99.....on pens. I was there at the old Wembley. I still fantasise the gills would be where they are now had they won that match!
DRINK THE DAMN BEER
Robbie with Bread 4's though 💥
Mansour what a great guy! 🤣
Jonny sins vs terry cruise… let the better bald win
Manchester City will be bigger than arsenal historic in 5 years
Gabriel gets in over any cb not named Dias.
City has a LONG LONG way to go to be a bigger club than Arsenal, facts. History is what makes a club so don't know what this cocky wank of a supporter is waffling about.   Yes you're winning things now, mainly because of the oil money that's been injected into the club but the facts are if both clubs was owned by filthy rich oil companies, and they both targeted The likes of Mbappe or Haaland, these type of players will accept Arsenal' offer over City any day. City ain't even as big a club as Nott forest and Villa ffs. 😂
steve had no genuine argument for the 'bigger club' statement because deep down he knows Arsenal are bigger. He just spent 5 minutes changing the subject. He also does seem like a genuine idiot to be fair
Robie has them jokes
As a neutral  Smith Rowe is better than Grealish and Saka
Robbie, you were chating shits. As an Arsenal fan I don't see any Arsenal player getting in Man city team.
100% esr has been outstanding
Two bold overweight lads having a good time this is football
Emile Smith Rowe is a substantially better player than Grealish. Pep would love ESR.
ESR would easily start over Grealish. Especially this season.
when the city fan talked about his journey i had some type of feeling, made me have tremendous respect for city fans and i continue to wish on y’all’s success 🙏🏽
Robbie and arsenal fans = pure delusion
The same Arsenal fan said Saka better than Sancho
I'm getting tired of people saying city bought their trophies.... Then what happened to the one's that they've lost.... Is it that they can't afford them?.... Newcastle united is now a richer club than Manchester city and I'm sure that if they don't accomplished nothing with that money... You all will be saying that they are useless... Why it that... If city Wins a trophy... They bought it and if they lose and don't end up with any... They are not good enough.... This is just so stupid... Since they are buying trophies that means they can buy some champions league titles... without competing for them... Right?... I really want some answers that really makes sense... How do you buy trophies?
They should get big Steve and Saeed on, that would be so funny
10:10 that’s the point of the invincibles. WINNING the league & NOT LOSING. Not doing only one
18:00 Steve - "One day. One day."?  "One day we're gonna be taken over by an Oil state and win all these tainted trophies"? 🤨😂
Man said Emile Smith-Rowe when at the moment he doesn’t even get in the best Arsenal lineup
Gabriel could make the team. He’s been on of the best defenders this season and could be a dangerous duo with ruben dias
Robbie don’t believe what he’s saying man said Saka, ESR and Ramsdale 😂😂 he just tryna accumlate mins
By now Manchester city is the best club in the world and even who is arsenal and the are not even better than Norwich to be honest and that is the fact
City fan myself but Man City are never gonna be as legendary club like Arsenal, respect Arsenal history
Listen, man. Day by Day that history argument by us is getting irrelevant. Right now City is bigger than Arsenal. No harm in being the bigger man and admitting it Robbie. That being said, this season we've been okay.
Arsenal is my team but when he said city will never be a big club as arsenal thats cap …city is getting there mann lets be honest
I hope you know they don't put down how many points on the winners medal - Roy Keane 2018  Invincibles rolls city centurion all day every day
Who is this guy
Im an arsenal fan but City is better in every position tbh,except gk ramsdale is level
Please get gary Neville and Jamie carragher on this
City fan talking down big clubs I wonder why. Small club, big oil.
Liverpool were 1 goal away from being invincible and came second
Saka, Smith Rowe, Tierny and Ramsdale Can Walk into the City team. Especially with City's Rotation
26 Wins 12 Draws.  90 points.  Man City got 100 points. Most wins in a Premier League season.  we don’t care if you go Invincible you can get 20 wins and 18 draws and still lose out on winning the league. 100 points in the league is literally guaranteed to win you the league.
I'm a united fan at first I thought would any arsenal player really get into that city team and I was thinking no chance but then I remembered I think Martinelli gets in that team over Gabriel Jesus in my opinion
Arsenal get more people at league cup games against AFC Wimbledon than city can have in the champions league. They’ll always be smaller than every other big 6 club.
Anybody that thinks Smith Rowe is better than Grealish doesn’t watch football. A great run of form against smaller clubs cannot be compared to multiple seasons of class. Once smith rowe preforms at this same level next couple of seasons a decision can be made. We all know what happened to dele Ali 🤷🏽‍♂️
Big Steve what a legend
Robbie is delusional
Steve talks with the confidence of a man who supports a state backed football team
Steve gets triggered when someone says citey isn't even a big club in Manchester 😂😂😂😂
Robbie is taking weeds he thinks ramsdale is better than Ederson 😂  Smith Rowe is good but i think saka i like as LB at city 🙂
Arsenal fan are actually delusional
To be fair City didn’t really need a Grealish type of player ,they just wanted to remind us that they are the biggest spenders
Big up Steve and The Don
Emile Smith Rowe in a front three which operates with a false 9. Yeah he ain’t getting in there unless it’s our B team. A front 3 three of Sterling Foden and Mahrez he doesn’t get in.
Not all Arsenal fans snort crack, forgive us
Cities titles are always and will always be tainted
Smith rowe is miles better than grealish 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 even when he was at Aston villa
Typical deluded city fan refuse to accept thy nothing without the blood money
Dislike button shouldn't exist for videos like this. Like or Love should be the only options. Great stuff!
As a neutral here… Can we all agree Arsenal have the worst supporters in the world
is that the nonce guy?
History is written every day. City are writing their history now.
Arsenal are the only team in the league to score in all their 38 matches in a single season. 2001/2002 season. Robbie substitute me let me roast that guy 😆
HOW DARE YOU HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THE DON
city never being bigger tan arsenal because of "history" is such a shit argument. history is made and if city continue doing what theyre doing obviously they will tick the history box in the future.
Big Steve has top banter  😂😂😂
“You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.” That’s a what happened to Arsène Wenger. He was a great manager but he should have know when to get out of the game at least move on before it caught up to him.
This city fan is jokes
Robbie big club yeah 😂😂🤣😂
Drink the pints
Emmanuel Dennis better than both 😎
At this moment in time  Is something robbie trips himself up big time  "In this moment in time city is miles bigger than arsenal" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Arsenal are a bigger club than City. Also this season Smith Rowe is better than Grealish.
That invincibles team is one of the most overrated in football history. Drew 12 games in the league, Got beat in both the FA Cup and League Cup, Were beaten twice in the Champions League group stage and knocked out in the quarters.
Tierney would get in that city team
Tierney would get in Man City’s team, Robbie clearly forgot the players 🤦🏼‍♂️
Smith Rowe is better than grealish but he still aint getting into City's team
That end was useless info the question was have city's trophies been bought and answer is 100% yes.  He literally said city won the lottery, it's like saying would city have won what they have since 2009 without money? Of course not, it's better to accept it rather than try and deny it.
I love Robbie but Arsenal fans needs a reality check no players would get in the city team and City are a bigger club right now than arsenal
ESR gets in ahead of Foden anyday. Foden plays with world class players, that automatically makes him look better Individually, talent wise, ESR > Foden
Absolutely no player in arsenal would get into our 11, only a few would get in our bench
I'm an Arsenal fan and even I know Robbie is chatting rubbish here.
Man city: League titles-5 Fa cups-6  Arsenal: League titles-13 Fa cups-14    Man city just like arsenal are lacking European success. So therefore we must turn to domestic success and arsenal are leaps and bounds higher. I wouldn’t say city can never pass our totals, but if any city fan says they’re bigger than arsenal with a smaller fanbase and less trophies then they are talking out their rear
I'm a Liverpool fan but the centurions were definitely a better team than the invincibles THAT DOES NOT MEAN PLAYER FOR PLAYER obviously Henry's still the prem goat
Robbie makes horrible arguments.  He always sounds delusional.
Arsenal are a bigger club always will be I’m afraid
Dumb and dumber
Aaron Ramsdale 😂😂
You ain't even the biggest club in Manchester 😂 Robbie shot him down straight away
I SWEAR TO GOD ROBBIE MAKES ARSENAL LOOK BAD LOOOL
He’s not an Arsenal fan
Watching this, it’s no wonder Robbie does the interviewing and isn’t being interviewed! Smith-Rowe in the City side? Take the red-tinted glasses off!
Arsenal are a bigger club than man city fact and I'm a celtic fan😂. Arsenal have won way more trophies than City have
City will be so much bigger than Arsenal in the coming years
Every manager and fans knows about the invincible. No one talks about centurion apart for city fans.
No Arsenal player will make Man City squad lets be honest
Grealish is better than smith Rowe,but this season ESR has been ridiculous!
Being a bigger club encompasses everything, from having fans all around the world to having a legacy to bank upon. Man City will become a bigger club than Arsenal in 10-15 years' time if the status quo doesn't change and City keep on winning and Arsenal don't win titles in that time. But as of now, City are a better run club and a more in form team than Arsenal, probably the team of the last decade in Europe or something.  But as of today, Manchester City is not a bigger club than Arsenal.
The first question is ridiculous what do you mean never if man city keep this up for the foreseeable future when we look back at what they've accomplished they will 100% be bigger than arsenal
16:38 100% in denial lol. without all that money, what the City fan would have probably been true. 1 FA cup before he passed away would be enough. lol
How dare call ladbible call The Don “arsenal fan” they think he’s a regular type of fan
That's actually a great story of Steve supporting City like that even tho he could just turn into the red side. Respect sir.
Right now arsenal are a bigger club, but in years to come city will keep writing history and become a bigger club than arsenal.
Hate this narrative that CITY has NO FANS I live half way across the world and I constantly see a lot of CITY FANS where I'm from everyday
Lol I've found a city fan, how rare are they?
This is why no one likes City fans.
Fun fact: this fat city fan can't even run 10 meters, why is he talking about ESR.  ESR>>>Grealish
They think things are gonna stay static. Clubs grow with success. As long as the club can reinvent itself and keep it going, newer generations will support them. Happened with all of them. If City keeps this up in the next 10-15 years they’ll have a massive fan base. The kids supporting them now will be adults sooner or later and it’ll spawn new fans again
The only reason man city is even relevant now is because they have pep. Once he leaves, no one will talk about them. Arsenal will always be a bigger club.
Arsenal arguing with Man City is like an old grizzled Schwarzenegger chatting to a 10 year old on steroids about who's strongest
Grealish is on paper “ better”, but ESR functionally serves a similar role to him, and if you look at practical impact along with the age difference ESR seems like a better investment atm. Who knows none of this really matters
Never knew Phil Mitchell was a Mancunian
This starts off like a segment on Jerry springer
Don Robbie Delusional
Robbie is actually done out how’s he saying he would play smith Rowe over grealish😒😒
This city fan is so deluded it's insane
Smith Rowe>grealish based on form
Arsenal have more premier league trophies than City lol
It’s such jealousy when it comes to the invincibles. You know how hard it is to continually win and not lose when EVERYONE wants to beat you. That’s why it won’t be repeated for a long time. It’s so hard! Getting over 100 points is nowhere near the same as being unbeaten in a season and this is from a fan of neither.
Little gold trophy out of a kinder egg 😂😂
Man City fans are so deluded
I think Liverpool have convincingly proven that a team can become Banter FC and back to the top of the mountain. Arsenal will be back.
Newsflash Arsenal have billionaire owner's to alot of Butthurt City haters COME ON CITY 🔘🔘🔘🔘🔘🔘🔘🔘🔘🔘
The point is that the invincibles would finish behind City and Liverpool because those teams won more games and so had more points. Liverpool could have been invincible in 2018/19 and still finish 2nd
ESR is better than Grealish and that's fact.
I hate all this tbh.. 2 fat blokes in football shirts arguing is a bit of a sad sight really
So dead this steve guy just shouts "top of the league" "beat you though" "we've got money and players" 😴 I was actually hoping city fans would have counter arguments but this guy is like a living twitter page. Maybe he's just not a great rep? I particularly liked the point "ESR would get found out in our team because it's a better team with better players" then proceeds to say "why didn't he show up against us" .... .... .... bruhhhh
City and Liverpool are desperate for the invincible title, let’s be real. I respect both teams, but they need to realise they’ll never do it unbeaten
Big baldy has approximately 2 days to live. Why? The Don has instructed his hitmen to ambush him for piping up with such nonsense.
Arsenal fans always gas up their players SMH, this is Smith Rowe's first season consistently in the Arsenal XI. Yes he's playing well, but if you're going into a big game 9/10 managers would start Grealish over him because he's consistently delivered. Smith Rowe is a baller though.
Being a city fan is defo boring
Man proved what everyone thinks about city fans. Come in with your rich Arabian oil money. Buy players, buy coaches, (name your stadium after ur rival), win championships and say you don’t care about football history. When city fall like the rest have inevitably you’ll have 5 premier leagues and a Final you lost for the champions league
Robbie needs to stop going on this. Making himself look like a clown
I love how robbie always looks the smartest in these interviews
Arsenal is and always will be a bigger club than city
Man city have no fans Fact
Arsenal fans would say their players could get into prime Barca ffs
as a Chelsea fan.. i like steve! Robbie telling us lies about Arsenal have more Social Media fans then Chelsea.. check again Robbie!
If they disallow the word "invincible" it would be like talking to the chair🤣
It is impossible to have a conversation with an Arsenal fan without them saying the words "henry" or "invincibles"
The history argument I hate it, because people think “history” means before 2000s. If city keeps winning things, in 25 years time their history would be what they win nowadays
I don't hate city cuz we ain't rivals like that and there's multiple things i could say about Steve's club but all I'm gna say is City have won the 2nd tier of English football more times they've won the league 👀🤷🏾‍♂️
Manshity will feel it when they lose pep. They acheive everything too fast to the peak. But that part of bigger club. Mamshity will never be it. Doesnt feel it when you done it from the ground up. Liverfool manu chelsea arsenal.. all over the world.. manshity n spuds long way to go to be a big club
I actually love football the way he speaks about city reminds me of my mum she loves city however I was very glad we beat them in Porto sorry mum 🙃
The arsenal bias is amazing from robbie 🤣oh my days ..how can he sit there and say Ramsdale gets in and Smith Rowe gets in the city team 🤣city are becoming a bigger club than arsenal..players would rather place for city than arsenal..sometimes take the arsenal cap off and be honest and face reality
Maltesrer head Ronnie is as deluded as ty at times
Robbie is just another typical arsenal fan stuck in the past
12 draws in invincibles. I’d honestly rather break points record
Big Steve 🐐
Holy shiiittt not even 4 minutes in and it’s spicy as hell
Smith rowe is better than grealish😂😂
City fan way too cocky lool. Obviously City is far superior now but to think 15 years of being good and online 5 league titles makes you a bigger club in Arsenal is just delusional.
You can’t put ESR in over grealish when he don’t even start
did he say ramsdale, saka and ESR get into city's team??? arsenal fans are deluded
Another deluded arsenal fan
ESR>Jack
You're deluded if you believe that City will NEVER be as big as Arsenal. The EFL was only established 130 odd years ago, it will continue to exist for millennia. Arsenal will probably still be a bigger club after we've all passed but to say "never" is mental.
Twice city have stopped invincibles from happening to another club
This defensive attitude that the fans of most of these oil-rich, state-backed clubs adopt whenever they are confronted with the truth that they bought the league is so disingenuous, they share personal experiences of supporting the club before the riches arrived and the mediocre ambitions they had as a club back then, well nobody is questioning their loyalty to the club, the truth is Pep Guardiola and his staff would not arrive at the club if the state of UAE's wealth were not setting up the foundation for it, additionally the amount of mistakes that Pep has been afforded at a club like Manchester City is not something afforded to most managers at a club which is run by proper organizations which have to compensate for losses made and do not have a bottomless pit of money to cover up losses. and a bottomless pit of litigation against the very governing bodies of their club's league when questioned about their unscrupulous activities.  Their football is brilliant beyond doubt, and Pep's footballing philosophy is genius and we are fortunate to have him in the league, City's management of the club and their finances after the initial turmoil is also commendable, but on the flip side we can see the sheer political and financial dominance they exert of the European and English football regulatory authorities, this is not healthy for football, and City are not solely to blame for this, the problem is with these footballing authorities welcoming ownership of clubs by oligarchs and monarchs with a questionable human rights record, they murdered the competition the day they compromised the competitive nature of the league for the gamut of star players a billionaire would bring to the league and in turn generate astronomical broadcasting revenues.  Today we stand in this mess where, no matter what measures are taken to level the playing field for the other competing sides in the league, by the distribution of broadcasting revenues and Equal share it barely makes a difference to the competition for e.g. City made  £168m for the 2019-20 season and Norwich made £94.5m despite getting relegated, but still, City manages to bring in 140 million pound worth of players in Dias, Ake, and Ferran Torres, because they do not need to bother investing on the other aspects of the club like a club owned by traditional corporations, a wage cap is the only way to stop clubs from unfairly exploiting the cream of footballing talent out there but we all know it will never be implemented.
Yes smith rowe has been good but he still nowhere near getting in the city team
The Don Vs The Boss Baby
"Manchester City will never be as big as _____" Why are we having this argument every single time? It's clear they have the potential not just being a big club but the biggest club in England.
From a United Fan rather win 3 trophies with 100 points in the PL than win one trophy unbeaten.
Haha. Arsenal only have history to talk but no trophy. I bet we will take trophy than history. It's been last 10 yrs man city is rising. Going forward city will gain momentum.
ESR over Grealish. Gabriel over Stones hell, even Dias. Tomiyasu over, whoever TF is standing in for Walker.
Smith Rowe is not better than grealish as steve says he dosent show up in the big games lmao
Cmon Steve even you gotta admit esr been better than grealish this season. I want grealish to do well but he hasn’t been able to hit the ground running since he came city
Ayo why has the city fan got an iron cross on his arm also known as a Nazi cross
I agree with the city fan, people are jealous of them and they say ‘ money shouts ‘
jesus thats the 2 biggest things arsenal fans ever going on about the 'invincibles'... yeahwell done you wasn't the first though was ya! and we have such a young squad.... hasn't that been the excuse since wenger? lmao
Don was right about The Emirates always selling out. Even league cup match with farmer, the stadium will be full.
Man City- the Club that buys the league!
Robbie you missed Martinelli
Damn my man looks so British in that thumbnail.
I love the agenda against the invincibles yet forget that we lost 0 games whilst still reaching the 90 points mark lol
I mean he kinda is as a United fan I’d trust smith Rowe over grealish. Grealish is Euro 2020 hype, smith Rowe is youth quality
Bro why didn’t grealish turn up when you lost to mid table palace oh no answer 😂 10 goals and 5 assist compared to like 2 goals 1 assist this guy is smoking sommet saying esm will get found out 😭
Cancelo right back and Tierney at left back
Arsenal invincible are overrated
Man City did not buy their trophies. They bought incredibly well in the transfer market. The signings they made won them trophies
in this video i see 0 ucl😏
Had to stop the video when he reckoned Man City's titles weren't bought. I'm a Chelsea fan and we've bought ours, just as pretty much every club in history has. Embrace it don't bury your head in the sand lad.
The Centurions my foot. What trophy did they get for that? The Invincibles over every team in the EPL.
Forgetting what jack did to arsenal at the villa
Aww no Robbie stop embarrassing yourself..smith Rowe good young player butvtheres not a chance in hell any arsenal player makes city's team and if they did pep would come for them...arsenal delusion spreads to all there fans 😴
Smith-Rowe can't even get into the arsenal team atm.. no way he get's into city's ahead of grealish
Brilliant that speech about city at the end. 👏
The city is soo deluded
Not even an arsenal fan but city are no where near as big
Saying city didn't buy thier trophies is deluded
Current form ESR > grealish. Overall player grealish > ESR
Ask him to break the unbeatable record. Which city can't try
All of them city hater being salty finding excuses for losing typical loser behaviour be a man stop crying and complaining. Take L and try next season
Aybo! 🤣 He wishes he had that invincible trophy! Bro that's a beautiful achievement. Especially in the premier league!
This season ESR is returning more goals to his team and there's no transfer fee but he did get a new contract. Grealish is England's most expensive domestic player and hasn't provided as many goals. There's a lot more time left. Look back in 2 years...
This guys been buying his retro man city tops online since 2012
And why do you say city spend money, what did you spend for players tree leaves. Arsenal have spend a lot this transfer window than any other team.🤨
The guy said 12 trophies in 10 years, then said we haven't won anything in 15 years..... Should he perhaps review Citys trophy haul? How many of the 12 are FA Cup or League Cup? If he sees the FA Cup as a nothing trophy then is he even a fan? He certainly shouldn't be including them as a trophy they've won if so.
The City fan not able to admit that their success wasn’t bought is hilarious.   He his delusional
17:59 up the mariners ⚫️⚪️
This City fan is fucking Deluded... City will NEVER be as big as Arsenal.. better? yes! easy right now.. but bigger? not a chance! the Arsenal invincible team were deffo a better side, that was a bigger achievement, no one in the league were as tough as the 90's through mid 2k's united team and to go play em twice with zero losses is a huge deal, plus the premier league was a lot! tougher back then, picking up points against lower lvl teams was a BATTLE and you'd get the crap kicked out of you, not like todays players, little Ponces falling all over the place and reffs blowing the whistle every 5 seconds, i see at the beginning of this season that Reff's tried getting it back to that status in the premier league allowing hard challenges to go on the wayside but of course all the little bitches complaining that its to rough, now they are reverting to the Ponce game.
All man city fans are plastic fans because it's a plastic football club. It's not an accomplishment to buy trophies. An accomplishment is something you earn. You don't accomplish something when you buy a TV or a new sofa etc so it's no different with trophies
An Arsenal fan claiming someone has bought success clearly doesn’t know the history of their own club. Does a certain Henry Norris ring a bell? The only difference between City and Arsenal is that their financial backing happened much earlier in their history. Time makes us forget things.
arsenal and man city 11                                                                      ederson      walker                    dias                                                       laporte                      cancelo                                                                     rodri                                     de bruyne                                         silva              mahrez                                         abauyamang                                         stering
Big Steve slaying with his Invincible comment. #Facts. You can be Invincible and relegated.
One good season and robbie thinks any arsenal player should be in the all time prem 11 🤣😭 talks out his ass man all the time biased to a t as a neutral grealish is far better dont let form fool you ffs when on form grealish is on another level and yes i know smith rowe is younger but currently grealish is a better player and will be for a few years
Just two tea-bags making noises at each other.
Arsenal fans always say we have history but why history doesn't give you success🙄
Discuss Tomiyasu over walker this season?
Grealish and Trent Alexander Arnold  are the most overrated English Players .
City is consistently growing overtime and how do you say city will never be a big club.🤨
That City fan is seriously deluded
How can you take this City fan seriously? Hes literally as deluded as you can get. Hes not considering anything and just chatting rubbish.
Robbie is spot on when you see someone wearing a city shirt all you think is wow I’ve actually found a real life city fan
Steve hit the nail on the head with one comment  “I wouldn’t swap any other football journey for the one we’ve been on”  Spot on! It’s been incredible.From York City to Real Madrid,it’s been a hell of a ride
Robbie is deluded the way he speaks about Ramsdale over Ederson and Smith-Rowe can get into Man City team.
The thing is I like Robbie and that but he is just wrong I get that it’s opinionated but as a city fan I’d argue the liverpool team in 2018/19 is better than the invincible
Hopefully Arsenal don’t go with a defensive mindset we are and attacking side if we lose rather lose fighting than defending and get a big score we have a team now that’s beleaving in themself so hopefully they can trust themself more
Big Steve is something different. Always with quality banter
United spent money recently  what have they won
“My owner’s spends stupid money for his ego on a club that fall into ruin without his massive cash flow” “yeah well our supporters’ echo chamber is thrice the size of yours!”  4 minutes in and I want to stop supporting arsenal and give a wedgie to all six city fans
City will never catch Arsenal in size because Arsenal won’t stay stagnant or decline for long enough for City to catch up many years of history. City will continue to close the gap on club size but won’t bridge it completely before Arsenal get back near the top. Another 5 years and City might be in a dry patch with Arsenal improving slightly. I’m not saying Arsenal will be winning titles but I can see both clubs operating at a similar level
City are going to be at the top for the next 30+ years, after that they WILL be a bigger club then Arsenal, Robbie doesn't seem to understand that history can be made.
man city will become a big team as they're creating there history to say there never gonna be a bigger team than arsenal is a deluded and stupid thing to say history has to be created
These are rlly pissin me off, they’re just looking for that headline, this rlly ain’t it tho
He's actually touching my heart with that speech at the end and I'm a Liverpool fan. And yeah they're both right about that and he brings up some good arguments, but Man city still bought their success.
I’ve still never met a City fan
Grealish plays in Europe. ESR don't know that UCL life yet
Smith Rowe over grealish
They forgot about sterling
The problem is Smith Rowe would get lost in the same way Jack does. He stands out at Arsenal. He wouldn’t stand out with Foden, De Bruyne, Rodri, Bernardo about. Let alone Jack, Mahrez, Sterling
If arsenal get fourth spot this season they bought it
No arsenal player gets in
What rivals fans forget about us that we had 35 years will winning any trophy will also a few relegations whilst united Liverpool arsenal Chelsea and even spurs were winning lots of trophies  . Now we are making up from the years of not winning any major trophy’s 🤷‍♂️
We need to see Steve and Rory
Man said Ramsdale would get into City's team 🤣
Okay, I am an Arsenal Fan but Robbie was out done here, Citeh fan had really good points, should have brought Ty as backup 😅
how can he say city haven't bought success 🤣 got banged 8-1 by middlesborough season before the takeover, what a delusional baldy
I never met Man City fan for real 🤣
Grealish dont even get ahead of grealish in that city team
He went off in the end, pouring his heart out about city to not answer the question lol.
Robbie is delusional. I’m a huge Arsenal fan but  we are a second tier club at best and none of our players get in Citeh’s starting 11.
And I thought United fans was deluded
The question should be…. Is Smith Rowe/ Saka in the top 3 players when you choose between Sterling, Foden, Mahrez, Bernardo, Jesus, KDB, ESR, Saka, Grealish If your answer is yes…then they’d stand a chance to get in the city 11…if not… then….
the disrespect in this title😤it’s “The Don”
This guy cracked me up when he said when robbies walking down the street and someone says yes robbie big club again lol
17/18 city was better then invincibles
Gabriel tomi ramsdale saka smith rowe
The bald white geezer burning the history books like the Romans did to the books of Alexandria
City’s defence is more expensive than a lot of countries defence budget
If city wins the league. Nobody cares and move on
Grealish is averaGISH
Didn't know football was about not losing games rather than winning games, Invicibles won games but City just broke the English record in the history of football winning 36 games in a calendar year. And no disrespect but none of the Arsenal players would make in this City team,levels and trophies won are there to be respected. 100 points will be very difficult to be broken just like the Invicibles, both are special in their own way,plus only team to won the domestic treble, with all that dominance from, Liverpool, United, Arsenal to some extend as well.
To be fair…Smith Rowe doesn’t make it to the Arsenal starting 11 with Saka and Martineli
This indicate a fun match in this week
As a Liverpool fan, I’ve nothing but respect for this City fan
Am an arsenal fan and our fans did treat wenger poorly
I used to respect Robbie as he seemed to be the one aftv fan that was deluded. Last two videos on here hes been nothing short of deluded.
I like big Steve from Manchester United fan
Big Steve = Big Legend
Smith Rowe has more goals this season than any city player, this guy can't just defer to 'we are champions',
ESR is nowhere near as good as grealish, and has only been impressive for a season, long way to go, grealish to this point is a much much much much better player
Pep would take Tierney in a heartbeat
Looks like oil money makes you one cocky bastard too
Grealish may be good in Aston Villa days but he is underperforming in Mancity right now considering with his price and wage. While ESR is having 8goals and 2assists despite this is his first full season coming straight from academy is very impressive. ESR is a lot better than Grealish in this season.
City fans are so embarrassing
We will see how city perform after pep guardiola
Big Steve doesn't realise that arsenal's unbeaten season actually went 49 games as it spanned into the following season being beaten by Everton which is when the world witnessed Wayne Rooney
Steve us so funny but he's so right
Mancity should know they usually buy success ,oil rich fc
Man City are like new money in a room full of rockafellas 😂
The invincibles got 90 points only ten points less haha
City have 20 trophies to go before they can even argue this point
The invincibles is the most overrated Premier League team of all time. The best Prem team ever that they won 1 trophy and didn't even retain it.  Also, what was waffling about at the end? No gives a fuck about your journey mate. The trophies are still bought whether you've been there since Division 2 or not you bellend.
I greed that Rowe better s that Grealish, but the other ten City players are better that the ten Arsenal players..And we all know to that Pep 10x better than Arteta to.
Love robbie but he can be mad delusional
Big club arguments are so fucking pointless
The difference between an empty seat at the Emirates compared to Man city is Arsenals tickets are all sold.  As an Arsenal fan myself I actually went to Man city V PSG just to see Messi an got a ticket no problem 😂🤣😂
Robbie should feel bad for all the negativity he drummed up around Wenger. Him and his so called Arsenal ‘Fan’ TV. Did it all to get YouTube views and look where it’s put our club now. No wonder it’s a hard subject for him to talk about
Football is a business . Robbie just salty his owners broke as fuxk and don’t spend .
Tierney would be the only player to get in our team
Robbie was fuminggggg 😂😂😂 this city guy was mocking it 🤣 he’s speaking FACTS about the invincibles tho 😂
I'm an arsenal fan but Robbie mentality is terrible he's embarrassing himself desperately finding something to debate we are a bigger club historically but not for long the way we're going about things
this Man City fam is deluded. As a Liverpool fan ik arsenal invincible has gone clear
I'm surprised these 2 didn't debate Arsene Wenger vs Pep Guardiola or Sergio Augero vs Thierry Henry
I’m a city fan and I hate to admit it but I’d rather have smith Rowe in my side 🥲
This “Arsenal fans” platform is bigger than ladbible. Or will be by summer 2022.
Grealish was way better than smith Rowe when he was in villa so why would you think smith Rowe would shine at city
the city fan saying they didn't buy trophies... have a word with yourself. Deluded.
Regarding The Invincible team, just ask any neutral football fans which team they would prefer :)
THE DON IS HERE HIMSELF... WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE
As an international, I’ll say in the next 10 years if Arsenal continues like this Man City will be a bigger club globally because the young kids in Africa are becoming Man City fans because they are winning.  That was the same way Man United and Arsenal got fans all over the world. Never say Never . From a Liverpool fan
Steve had robbie on the ropes
There's something that never gets brought up that, imo, puts Arsenal among the world's biggest clubs. If you took a serious football fan, someone who really knows ball, from the past 30 years or so and showed them a good Arsenal goal with blanked-out kits and stands, they'd be able to identify it; 'oh yeah mate that's Arsenal right there'. They could do it with United, with Barca, perhaps Real, and they could do it with Arsenal. They couldn't do it with City, Chelsea, Atléti, Inter or any (big) club like that, because the club's football changes for the manager. At a huge club like Arsenal, the manager changes for the club, not vice versa.
Last question is ridiculous, if the money didn't came in to Man City they would still struggle in and around the relegation zone or even worse, playing in the championship.
Invincible >>>>> centurions
This man City fan 🤦🏻 absolute fool.
I have watched Robbie twice on this show now and I concluded he is a terrible debater.
I agree with Robbie he should have in 2015 after villa fa cup
I know a lot of city fans of the older generation that don't go to the games no more because city have lost there identity
Bowen is better than grealish this season
Classic man City fan no soul.
City may become a "big club" eventually, but will always have the money excuse associated with them like Chelsea. Teams like Liverpool, Arsenal, Man United have earned the "big club" status. There is no argument for City not becoming a "big club", there is argument for City never being a bigger club that those other teams.
Ederson> Steffan > Ramsdale. ESR, Saka are on similar level as Cole Palmer but doesn't get ahead of Grealish.  Playing for Pep is not that straight forward. Grealish gonna cook soon.
For what its worth City came to the fanscore when emirate and ethihad swiped their cards. But Arsenal have been in play all along and still is.
Who gives a flying Fk.
Love to see two 50 stoners have an a debate 😉
Robbie does have a point on the invincibles  And the cruel abuse that caused arsene Wenger to leave arsenal
BigUp 'StoneCold' BigSteve
Ramsdale gets in over Ederson 😂😂 imagine.  Ramsdale would just about get in above Scott Carson.
Steve is white robbie
Do chelsea spurs next
Smith Rowe doesn’t even get into the first 11 for Arsenal let alone Man city 🤣
Arm chair pundits 🤦🏼‍♂️
no way steve got a bigger belly than don rob
Ridiculous stamenent, but Robbie has no shortage of these
Just saw the title of the video, Smith Rowe is so much better than grealish
Why henry leave for barcelona , van persie for united , nasri , fabregas, big club behave yourself ,
Wonder who the guy in blue supported 10 years ago?
Bald openings
"City aren't a big club" My advice to you is, turn on the history channel and watch Arsenals old trophy ceremonies for comfort 😂😂. because it must hurt you seeing us lift another PL title live and in color this season, Pep yet again with a double, Pep is so unfair giving you muppets down the road, united, Liverpool, Chelsea hope just to crush it around Christmas 😂😂😂😂 brutal no wonder you lot are sore looking through your grandad's old DVD's for comfort
Is the city fan called mark by any chance?
If going unbeaten means so little why has no other side done it?
City fan made a great point at the emd
City fan is deluded, his team can do no wrong… “No pressure on Grealish” for 100 mil there should be all the pressure in the world…
Man city need to chill out thinking they are the best club in the world. They are the best team in the league but when it come to CL They keep chocking better than Mia Khalifa on the dick.😂
Robbie - We(Arsenal) will be back Back where ? 😂
Fans dari Indonesia. Cityzens juara lagi musim depan💪💪
If a sheikh had come in and bought The Arsenal then, to a large degree, Arsenal would've earned that investment.    Citeh have earnt absolutely nothing. Good luck to them though.
Thats the guy in the wheelchair from little britain
Robbie needs to calm down. In 2002/03 season we lost 6
lol man.city fan doesn’t know football
Grealish is a flop 😉
Man like big Steve ❤️ proper likeable guy.. and know what when anyone talks shit bout city and money, bro big Steve is one of those who’s been through it and can talk bout it all before the money come..
Robbie the man 💪
City are a small club. Facts
Man City did technically buy there trophies let’s be fair 🤣🤣
No arsenal player gets into city, Robbie is being a bit deluded there
Smith Rowe in City would be amazing I agree with delusional Robbie on that one
Grealish has not been better than ESR this season that’s an absolute fact. How is that even debatable.
Does that guy really think, the owners are cool when a 100m player doesnt do shit? lmao
“City have no history” we won the FA cup before Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool + United and won a european trophy before Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal. We obviously dont have a history as big as United/Liverpool etc but to say we have NO history is just a blatant lie.
Think gabby makes the back 4
The wenger part I don t agree with. Arsenal still haven t had a better season than his worst
I don’t know why city brag so much about the centurions as if Liverpool didn’t finish one point off them
City will soon be a bigger club than arsenal and i'd rather win trophies than want validations from others....
Don robbie represented well
Man like Big Steve reppin the boys, go on 💪🏼💙
Robbie, you could have totally thrashed Big Steve. You’re not good at making a convincing argument. Gotta do better.
15.36.... MAN-CHEENA 🤣🤣 Naa deffo for me, Invincibles was an amazing team but it would be so much more difficult to achieve that now.
Robie just said Smith Rowe is better thang Jack Grealish :D :D :D . The Arsenal fan delusions are mind-bending.
BIG STEVE your last speech gave me chills brother, you're the best mate. and people who are out there call us plastic fans you can stick a plastic straw right up your ass. Fans like Steve are the real fans of Manchester City that's why I love this club. #CityForever 💙💙
Lool Steeve had a point when he said who are you to talk about full stadiums
Moneychester Shitty know that once New Castle buy the mercenary Guardiola its over for them.
Even as a Liverpool fan, the Centurions vs Invincibles argument was embarrassing LOL Big Steve should get arrested for that
If Arsenal get top 4 this season they've also bought it, highest spenders this season, just using Robbies logic.
Smith-Rowe 🤣
So much harder to remain invincible, especially when you aim for it from the start. It's not just about the performance, it's about the mental attrition your brain goes through all season, desperately giving everything on and off the pitch to make sure not a single team beats you.
The invincible trophy wasnt tiny that was just Arsene Wengers leaving present
Hopefully mancity plays this to the players before the Arsenal game
As an arsenal fan it's beautiful to watch this city fan speak about his journey as a city fan. From division two to Bernabeu. What a story. We all wish we had oil money.
City fan so arrogant 🙄
Arsenal fans living the past
What has Grealish even done this season
im only watching this bc i like robbie and bc i think he isnt as deluded as other arsenal fans
As a Man U fan, never thought I’d agree with a City fan but I think that the highest point total in history of the premier league is more impressive than the Arsenal’s invincible season.. in Arsenal’s unbeaten season, they didn’t even beat man united in the league (drew twice) and in the cup lost to man united (obviously I know the cup isn’t the premier league but my point is that the arsenal squad that season wasn’t actually as good as they make it out to be) I’d rather have my team going out to beat teams than hold out for draws… as much as it hurts me to say, fair play to city on that
We need saeed vs big Steve united vs city that would be fire
Simply put… without the oil 💰 MC wld be bang average.
Robbie has a fan with city can never become bigger than Arsenal but the arguments he uses are so bad. History is enough and he should elaborate on the fact that bigger does not necessarily mean better. City are currently better, no denying that but Arsenal have had something called history where they have won a huge amount of trophies which is why they are bigger
Arsenal bought their trophies in the 30s. They seem to forget that!
I’d have smith Rowe over grealish
Wsup with not touching the beer?
Man city will become a big club unless something goes terribly wrong, but they re not there yet. They need another generation of fans to grow up imo
I'm a Leeds fan so unfortunately both players are out of our league atm but if I had a choice I would take Smith Rowe.
This Man City fan is delusional
I wonder how many city fans in these comments use to support arsenal, Liverpool or United
Robbie has started aftv then got it to a point where it runs itself basically now he's a YouTube personality all in his own with his own channel and features on other channels
that speech at the end was amazing
That's a great point from man city supporter. Draw 38 games invincibles anf get relegation. 100 points is just a pinch better than invincibles. Just a salt crystal more.
I'm a United fan and I have to say Man City will never be a bigger club then Arsenal no chance no no no Chance
This City Guy is class🔥
"Arsenal Fan"   That's the Don! He's bigger than ManCity on his own💥💥
Arsenal are bigger than city
On ESR, the main point should be can Rowe adapt faster than Grealish in a new squad and pepball and perform as well ...
Wow Man City fans are deluded
City bigger then Arsenal? 😂😂 Arsenal is the third biggest club in England behind Pool and United, City ain’t even bigger then Spurs, Chelsea and Villa… this guy is a clown
How many games did the invincible team draw
Manchester City got relegated twice....
What’s Robbie smoking
What a stupid and useless debate...
Not one arsenal player would get on city’s bench
ESR doesn’t start ahead of sterling tho even if he starts ahead of Grealish
Steve saying City didn’t buy their trophies.. 😂😂😂😂. Mate cmon. Embrace it but don’t deny it. If City didn’t get bought out the way they did they would be a bottom half club battling relegation year in year out. Of course they bought them.
Arsenals stadium is never full
I'd even put Martinelli over Ferran Torres
Big Steve wearing a retro Man City shirt to try and convince us that he didn’t become a fan in the last ten years 🤣
Man City will run out when the oil runs out, nth intended
How’s Dr Evil sayin city didn’t buy their success? 😅😂🤣
Arsenal and Man United fans: We are the “biggest clubs in England” 😂 Must be fun supporting the “biggest clubs” without winning anything😂  (Recent years)
Man City are deffo the best team it’s not even a argument
The invincibles are massively overrated, arsenal fans will hold onto that for well over 100 years ffs, its legit the only argument they have in the modern day🤢🤮😄
One deluded man in red & white
Anyone can achieve 100 points these days now as level got 98 points so it will be broken soon maybe Man City again but not losing a single game in 49 games is just insane coming from Man City fan and Also I would take invincible over 100 points as its way harder
I stopped watching after man said City is a bigger club than Arsenal 🤣🤣🤣
City fan is deluded lol
As an Arsenal fan actually embarrassing watching people like robbie. Say city continue there run over the next 10 years winning another 6/7 prems and a UCL how can they not be bigger lmao
Put aside being a Spurs man I have to agree with everything Robbie says......... On the first topic.
One thing I will give to City is that they don't just spend money unnecessarily, they spend it wisely, both for managers and for players. That's why they are the huge success that they are today. Man Utd could learn a thing or two from that.
Nobody actually cares about going undefeated in the league barring Assna fans
Can’t believe he doesn’t think City haven’t bought trophies haha
As an arsenal fan I have to say Smith Rowe wouldn't get in but Saka would get in over mahrez and Grealish anyday
Manchester City Is the biggest Club in England Period! if you disagree Bring your 11 we'll bring ours. let's play for that Honor 😂😂
Must be difficult to not take a sip of a fresh pint for 20 minutes
If Pep stays, Arsenal are history
"Haven't thrown money here and there"- yet they've spent 200mil on full backs alone. Give it a break😂
Man City fan is deluded. They’re actually the worst fans in the league 😂😂
One was bought for a 100m tho
I think the point the city fans made about the invincible and the centurion team is a good point I would rather win more games and get more points than to win some games and draw the rest and be known as invincible like he says that’s all arsenal fans go on about.
Love how Steve refered the arsenal invincible trophy to a  'little gold kinder egg'😂
Im a city fan, and this man is delusional at times ngl, especially the first question
Sorry but this city fan has zeeo ball knowledge
Lets just make it straight no football club cansurvive without money in this century if you hate us well use your time machine and go to the time with football and no money spending
Ramsdale will never bench ederson he's good playing out from the back but not as good as ederson anyway , ederson is the better keeper
We bought our stadium yes it's cost u 15  Years with no trophys haha thats banter 💪
Robbies deluded he represents all the deluded arsenal fans
Mancity has good players with good squad depth then arsenal. Mancity 2ndstrings team can battered 1st senior Arsenal team any sec, any time any day. Man city plays ucl big games. Arsenal can't even play europen league for 5 or 6 years. Past is past.
We gonna smash city so cry
Robbie is not the right man for this…..Bring hugh, or DT lol
Big Steve is a clash act 😂😂😂 now to go and humble the true Georgie podcast
Did Robbie understand the first question?
I love it, robbie getting roasted
Overall as a club in there life time arsenal are bigger
This fun to see...🤭
No Arsenal player gets in City’s 11. Robbie deluded
CITY WIILL NEVER BE AS BIG AS US - FACT
This is why nobody wants Arsenal to be good again. They have not beat a single top 4 team this year and look at how they are running their mouths to the champions man shut up ederson having a “shaky season” is still better than ramsdale’s best season. You put Sterling, foden or mahrez in their starting front 3 Arsenal instantly become top 4 that’s how good our front men are. Robbie needs to relax man he sounds like them old timers that think they still got it.
2 biggest teams in England and this will never change...Liverpool Fc and Manchester United. End of.
Arsenal are way bigger not saying over time city can overtake lot of clubs but they are smaller than Chelsea arsenal Utd and Liverpool
Great show. I'm no no advocate for our manager at any rate until he proves himself with top4 but if there's one shining light in our season, it's Smith-Rowe. 8 League goals and it's barely January are you joking??! Hands down better than Grealish this season, even if City win the League. Rowe is next to Odegaard who is totally unproven. And Xhaka instead of Rodrigo lol! Not title-winning thoroughbreds Bernado and Sterling!!
I'm here Robbie😂😂😂  Chelsea fan✌🏾💙
Esr has been lvl better this season but not overall
imo Tierney ESR Saka walk into that team, Ramsdale debatable
Arsenal, Liverpool, and United are institutions, they’re not football clubs. They are literally that big. City could win 5 more titles and Arsenal would still have more of a name than them. City bought success, Arsenal pioneered and worked hard for it over 100 years, theirs a difference and their will forever be a difference.
THE NEW GENERATION WILL SUPPORT CITY AND AS FOR ARSENAL AS THEIR FANS BASE GROWS OLDER THEY MIGHT NOT BE A BIG CLUB COME 20 YEARS  FACTS!!!!!!
toxic man city fan😂😂
Classic city fan, deluded
Arsenal will always be a bigger club than city. City is not even a bigger club than Chelsea
Pep would actually pay Grealish money to have Saka in his team at RW
Edison Tomi Dias Laporte Tierney Partey De bruyne Silva Sterling Laca Saka
City nonce
Arsenal have a 100× bigger fan base Than Manchester city  Manchester city have 100× been a better team than arsenal over the last 10 years  Arsenal have 100× better history than Manchester city from 2008 and beyond that  Manchester city are 100× a better team than arsenal at the moment  Debate over 🤷‍♀️
City. Farce.
This 'if you draw 38 games you get relegated' argument is so stupid. People make out as if the Invinvibles drew all their games and got an award for it. No. They *won the league* and went unbeaten
as a united fan i have much more respect for arsenal than i do for city regardless of past rivalry. the arsenal invincibles were incredible and arsenal are a bigger club it’s as simple as that, city are not a big club
i know arsenal fans are so deillusional but how can the city fan say grealish has been better than smith rowe haha
Not a City fan but they deffo can be bigger than Arsenal one day. If Arsenal don't win titles and City keep dominating they'll overtake them
Next time drink your fucking pints
I can’t take a single city fan seriously this guy is trying to violate arsenal they can’t even get a full capacity stadium just look at the state of their fans after winning the league literally two fans in sight 😂
Big Steve repping us well, come on you blues 🔵
Robbie - "Ahh 100pts run of the mill stuff". I mean it isn't tho is it if no one else has done it 😂😂😂😂
Big Steve won the only thing Robbie says is  you have no fans and I am United fan smith rowe better then grealish oh my this when I give up with this video
Arsenal best
Arsenal man speak facts, actually he doesnt speak, he spits
If Man City continue on this streak of performances they will eventually be bigger than Arsenal. Man City has a network of sister clubs all over the world. Btw NYFC just won the MLS Cup.
Let’s be real smith Rowe isn’t getting in over foden or Bernardo silva and Saka isn’t getting in over sterling or mahrez
Steve is just insincere.
I don't think grealish is better than smith rowe but he for sure has been better than him this season , you could probably argue he has been better than foden aswell
What I wanna know is who even is that city fan no idea who he is
I don’t understand how anyone can say that going invincible in the league in a season is better than getting 100 points. Invincible season is cool, but it isn’t all that. Didn’t even win any other trophies that year.
Man City can’t even fill there stadium & the stadium ain’t even there’s 😂. A big club is fan base trophy’s & history & self made club. Not a club got
Man City haven’t bought the trophies? Hahahahahahaha
Only City fans call themselves Centurions.. literally nobody cares, melts
ESR  No contest this season.
I've been click baited by that massive white egg, I just had to see it in action..
I’m a big rowe fan but he can be in a few years. But this season he’s definitely been better then grealish
This Man City fan actually bleeds blue innit , impossible to have a debate with someone like that
Grealish is a flop
With cancelo at right back. Tierney is by far the best option for left back. Surprised he didn’t get mentioned
Robbery channelling the delusional energy of Ty in this one 🤡
Arsenal fans say there bigger than spurs coz they win things so how are Man City not bigger than you lot with 12 trophies in ten yrs
Can arsenal fans stop living in the past, starting to sound worse than spurs fam…
Arsenal Fan? You talking about Don Robbie? Are you still alive?
Assna not even in the top 4 big clubs for last two decades.
Smith rose would get in at number 10 at Manchester City did Robbie just say 🤣 I’m a Man Utd fan but even I will say that is ludicrous 😂 de Bruyne foden grealish B. Silva Gondogan where is smith rowe possibly playing there
Arsenal fans are the saltiest
I’m just pissed that they didn’t drink their pint😂
Can’t lie that pint doesn’t look very tasty
premier league trophies or league titles?
Man City has literally only be a thought in peoples mind the last 9 years don’t act like you are a big club. Genuine losers without the money you are nothing how sad
Don Robbie cooking Steve ❤️❤️❤️
I like this Steve guy. I'm dying in laughter.
I'd rather win the league having the highest  points in a Premier League season then going undefeated
arsenal is a bigger club, but saying man city will never be is stupidity, because in the future 10-15 years they probably will. smith row is playing in the 10 position.... city are playing foden and de bruyne in the number 10.... so yeah no arsenal player will get in...
Wenger was treated like shit towards the end... Especially by Arsenal fans...
How the Man City fan put ‘Strongly Disagree’ for bought success…. DELUDED HORRIBLE PLASTIC CLUB
Not a city fan but every team arguably bought their trophies man United used to sign players like Rio Ferdinand and Keane etc and no one says anything
Love the retro mancity jersey! Blue Moon for life~
Haha. I love this big steve guy. His humour and story telling is on another level
Jokes aside and bias aside, Grealish isn't worth £100 million, plus, I don't see how Grealish is better since ESR has got his chances in the 1st team. Look at the stats, eye tests as well. ESR is a much effective player than Grealish. At Grealish's age, ESR would have eclipses him x2. Sensible City fans I've talked to also said the same, what does Grealish offer that City doesn't already have except for an extra player and at that price, it's basically nothing.
Man City is a GMO club. Arsenal, Liverpool, Man Utd are organic
How do you even talk to this city fan? Their manager going on social media crying needing more fans to come to the game. 11 times relegated. Without oil money they wouldnt even be in the premier league.
Even if Smith Rowe gets into our team it will take him 1 year to perform. Same with Grealish
Who has the largest beer belly....Both...Agree, Strongly agree...
Man utd and Liverpool are the only clubs bigger than arsenal fuck city and chelsea
Smith Rowe is the Most overrated football player of all time
1. Arsenal are a bigger club than city because they have more trophies and a bigger fanbase. But those things can change so you can't say that city will NEVER be a bigger club.   2. I don't think any Arsenal players get into the city side.   3. Invincibles are better than the current city team but the centurians are better than both.   4. Some Arsenal fans treated Wenger badly, some didn't. A fanbase is made of individuals who don't all act the same way.  5. City did buy their trophies.
38 points and invincible but relegated is a pretty good argument... lol.
Yeah I doubt Ramsdale is making city's team
Haven’t you already lost the bigger picture argument when you are arguing MAYBE ONE player could get into City’s rotation? Lol. Key word rotation. Man City rotates like crazy. Because they are trying to win everything. So could an Arsenal player or two get into the rotation? Sure. Could any get into the best 11? No. Grealish himself doesn’t get into the best 11...
Three vids are fun to watch but ultimately pointless. No one is gonna concede anything bad about their club and people just end up saying the dumbest shit.
Everyone buys their trophies. No club would’ve win anything without buying players and only relying on their academy.
History comes with time so eventually city and chelsea will have more history(trophies) than arsenal
So this is what happen to dt…nice disguise
C Ronaldo is better then Arsenal players and Man City.
Jack's a snake glad it's not worked out for him UTV
Robbie’s face at 5:06 when he knows he’s cappin 😂
the history of a club plays a big part but it’s always the clubs that aren’t as big as they used to be (ARSENAL) that over-exaggerate the importance of it. Man city currently are not as big as Arsenal but eventually they will be. Chelsea have been a ‘Big Team’ for almost two decades now and are only just now or soon approaching the size of Arsenal Football Club regardless of comparing current achievements
Don’t mess  with the don again
Man City: We buy trophie... Arsenal : We earn trophies...
Im from Sweden, even I know that Arsenal has ten times more history than City.  City will in a few years have a very big hangover, for sure they will.  Sakah is the only player in Arsenal right now that will become a world clas player.  And AFC will be a better club if the let Spotify owner be a part of there club. 100%
Saka as left back??? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 This city fan needs to do some research...
Arsenal fans surely this man is just embarrassing you at this point
Don Robbie smiling 😁😁
What’s the city fan on about? Arsenal have sold out the 2nd most tickets in comparison to their capacity this season despite the awful start.
All other teams want Man City to win the league if their own club ain't winning it, That's how big Man City is.
Everyone “buys their success” now. What Arsenal will always be a bigger club because they bought their success earlier? And Man City has a decent amount of history. I mean a top 20 English team when it comes to history. Pre-2010. And in terms or international fans. It’s all about success. So Man City will soon have more international fans than Arsenal if they continue to win and Arsenal continues to lose...
Man said they were oil money and trophies then says they didn’t buy their trophies! Come on man wobble your head
Lindt lindor white chocolate truffle VS The big Maltesers
Lol I just checked and you can still get season tickets for Man City for the remainder of the season 😂😂😂
It's like someone becoming a self-made  Millionaire and somebody inheriting daddy's money and claiming  He made it alone #Arsenal all day
17:48-19:40.  Made me emotional there, great speech.
Arsenal were run by the Bank of England and that’s how they had early success. Arsenal also bought it all.
Jesus this man City fan is way over his head haha
They should get ty here for these debates
bruh these arsenal fans lol
Lol when you’re walking down the street and someone say “hey Arsenal, big club 👍🏻”
That City fan looks like my history teacher but with no hair
We finished #2, #3, #4 with giroud and #8 with auba, 10000% we overachieved under Wenger but we were blind to see that Nad we treated him badly :(( am sorry but it's true
Invincible wasn't worth £100 but city's players worth almost a billion😂😂
Man killed robbie
One can not have a constructive conversation with Robbie, he is biased and unable to think without taking the red tinted glasses off.
Surprised it took the City fan so long as 9 minutes to mention Liverpool
Bigger club at the moment is decided on where the big players want to come . City are the current big dogs in England .
ESR is better than Grealish on current form, but ESR still doesn’t get in front of Foden, Mahrez, Sterling, Bernardo Gundugan, KDB etc etc…
"Arsenal Fan"? that's Sir "Don" Robbie for you, put some respect on the Don's name.
we did everything with modest budget then city money.
all i know is that i wasnt born in the 60's 70's and 80's i was born in '98 and my team is doing whilst im alive idc what teams where doing back then they can have their history im in the middle of witnessing history thats much more important to me.
Only part actually worth listening to was the Arsene Wenger part. Calm and on point.
How many times man City been relegated???? 🤔 Can't even fill there own ground 🤣🤣🤣
As a gooner, with the first question, the history argument doesn’t really make sense because if city keep winning things like they are now, in 25 years, their “history” would be now
Check out what this moron Kroenke has done to us.  Mancity squaring with us and this trust the youth process thing for a huge club like Arsenal.
Ramsdale over Ederson? Saka over Mahrez? ESR over Foden/Grealish?🤣  Robbie truly is deluded
Here before we get smashed by Moneychester City
This banter!!!
“We’ve brought well” ye Steve you got that right you’ve spent 2 billion on players and “I can’t thank Mansoor” so because of him you’ve brought sooooo many players and won trophies if it wasn’t for him you’d of won jack shit and be irrelevant still! So the question is true city brought success 😂😂
Nobody cared abt em until some oil spilled in
Without a doubt esr is better than grealish
too bad arsenal lost to barcelona in the 06 final and city to chelsea last season. we wouldve had an insane arguement if those games went the other way
The best summing up on City’s journey from Big Steve ever Left me speechless The guy is spot on Every City hater needs to hear this 🔥💯
Imagine thinking city didn't buy their trophies 😆
Hilarious comparing the Sergio moment to the 'Treble' One is something which has not been replicated/unprecedented and the other was a senior managers final years against a massive check book. City have done well to get on the map but their legacy needs building on more than Pep/Money/Etc.
City can't even fill they own stadium even Pep pleading and begging city fans come to stadium and with that billions oil money still can't win champions league
Manchester City are a bigger club than Arsenal, pretend we’re not all you want. Just the way it is
Slowly ruining the league City are
best argument ever if u draw 38 games u are invincible, and relegated
City are not a bigger club than Arsenal 😂, what’s he smoking lol
If Man City win the UCL, they will be a bigger than arsenal, that’s facts city are better than arsenal, arsenal used to be big now they are the banter club
probably the most bias city fan you could  have  got, city a bigger team than arsenal is  laughable
Arsenal have more trophies more accomplishmants better legends of the game more history bigger brand more fans in England more fans worldwide arsenal have had success since the birth of football man City have had sucees in the 50s and the last 10 years the few City fans there are really are so deluded Arsenal are 3 times the club man City are.
Both the Centurions and Invincibles are great achievements, Centurions are more important to City fans and Invincibles are more important for Arsenal fans, both are equal in my opinion because it's never been done before and probably will be very hard to do it again, for me it's the Invincibles but i also respect the people who pick Centurions, same goes for United's treble winning side
EMILE SMITH ROW GETS IN
Grealish is still better  . And  city are better because they have won more
I think it’s a joke that a city fan should be on here, you should only have arsenal, Man Utd, Liverpool which have built clubs from the ground up, it’s disrespectful city coming in here as they have ruined English football and the Orem is becoming like the french league only one team winning as they will spend another 200 mil on players in the summer and the Orem don’t do nothing and no financial fair play in the game, it’s a disgrace and sums up the country
I just heard rumors that Pep want Nuno Tarvares to City ffs we just got him like 6 months chill Pep !
Arsenal has 13 Premier leagues and 14fa cups. City has a couple of premier leagues and a load of cash. They're a small club that won the lottery. They'll never understand how to build success from the ground up like Arsenal,  Man utd or Liverpool.
*This season? Yes Smith-Rowe has been better than Grealish. That’s a fact.*
but yes to me Arsenal are and allways will the 3rd bigest club in England , but city like villa   Spurs chealsea Newcastle leeds  , Everton certainly got the potential to compete with the big 3
Grealish is just homesick…
citys success is not organic, the big 3 of liverpool arsenal and man u have an aura about them but because of the new generation it might be lost to these oil clubs
I actually do think smith Rowe is better!
As a die hard city fan  grealish is trash for city. Offers nothing
I like how peasants are arguing over billionaires who get money kicking a ball around get a life
2:21 "your not biggest than us now" they won the carabao cup 4 years in a row, destroying the prem nearly every season and they got champions league final last season. Arsenal are nothing 😂😂🤦‍♂️
Man City bigger club than arsenal biggest joke lmao 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Man City compare to Arsenal, wtf 🤣. That 5-0 match is already answer it. Sh*t club after Tottenham,  talking about history like a nerd 😂
Arsenal have big fanbase like manutd , city is only oil money and presently winning...from india ask only manutd and arsenal is bigger here after chelsea ...
Big up big Steve - he's joke - something different in the footballer YouTube influencer space. Big up the big six show as well!!!
Big fan of Robbie but Steve won every argument in my opinion
Man united are bigger club then city where the real Manchester 3 European cups 20 leagues and yes I agree with Rob arsenal are bigger club
Only one player walks into the city team from arsenal and that’s Kieran tierney
Gabriel is better than Laporte and Stones though
I find it funny how Robbie channel was the main reason for the negativity and abuse Wenger got. People like Troopz and DT (who profited off Arsenal demise) giving abuse on the channel after games about Wenger, looking back was terrible. I agree Wenger had to go but looking back AFTV were the one of the reason for the the toxic atmosphere at the club. So Robbie is a bit of a hypocrite here.
I agree smith Rowe would shine in a city system, Steve just biased can’t talk to city fans to full of themselves! I swear he’s th  only city fan in youtub, small club, small fanbase!
I'm neither an arsenal fan nor a city fan but I think Smith Rowe has really proved that he has it to become a great footballer, when it comes to dribbling along with running no one comes close to Smith Rowe. Atm Grealish has been used extremely wide by Pep and hence he can't cut in and contribute much but their comparison is wrong as Grealish should start to be in his prime and Rowe has been the senior league for a couple of years
smith rowe’s game is tailored made for city 1 touch and move.grealish and city shouldn’t have never crossed paths
city had great history well before Arsenal in 1930 , 84 thousand record crowd, Arsenal 73 thousand at Highbury, city great away support whatever the division, Cant believe the city fan doesnt back this up and lets that tooll makes  out City were invented in 2011  , even he knows thats bullshit
I'm no city fan but Robbie is deluded here. Apart from the size of clubs he's wrong on everything 😂 Oh and the buying it of course
ESR > Grealish
I hate man city with a passion
The prime Invincibes would beat the Prime Centurions.
About Wenger, good one Robbie 💯
Totally agree on Aston Villa Grealish…he’s turned into that 100 million player…aka the money has gone to his head!!
History is shit. Man City fan base is building and building its history.  In 10 years, Arsenal will still be lower than Man City. Robby is so wrong man.
City can’t sell out stadiums and they’re a bigger club? My god
Inbred manc hahahaha
This show is just for views..not an argument lol city could never be bigger than arsenal they are better but never bigger..
If anything Grealish is the one who’s been found out for a fraud
Degrading the Don to just a fan? I would be pissing my pants if I were you.
That invincible comment about being invincible and getting relegated had me 😂
They had me at Smith Rowe being better than grealish! 😂 Absolutely deluded fans
Holy crap that City fan is arrogant
Man City fans we don’t care about oil, money and trophies 😂 mate you don’t shut up about it that’s all you can talk about
To say Man City will never be bigger than Arsenal is the most stupid thing ever
What I hear from the city fan is " we don't care."
man city are a big cllub
This is the problem with stave he says is this the history channel but then talks about how many premier leagues they have on, that they were nobody’s before the oil money like he stalks so much about his own clubs history that whenever people talk about their own clubs history he contradicts
Arsenal- no History fc- yes
That’s a Luton fan wearing the red/white shirt?
ESR has at least 7 goals in EPL this season. Grealish has 2 and missed sitters
What is this idiot talking about bigger club??? So used to bought success just take your blood money and go home to being the second biggest club in Manchester
I agree with Robbie (and the countless others ofc!) that city have of course bought their titles. But... listening to Steve and where his club were (I remember city being relegated, they did a Sunderland from the top flight down to div 2), the years of being in utd's shadow, etc.  But as a football fan, I can totally understand why you wouldn't give a damn and just enjoy the success.
He prob was the same prat that slagged grealish off before hand . Man city haven't built anything bought it there a joke
Everyone in the comments arguing over ESR & Grealish when the question was about if anyone gets in Citys starting XI. I think its fair to say Grealish isnt in the Starting XI if Pep plays his first team. Basically arguing if ESR gets on Citys bench :D
Arsenal 13 League titles    Man City 7 league titles
Proper city fan vs someone who knows fuck all about football
City has a better team and recently more successful but their not a bigger club than Arsenal
Wenger out
I agree with robbie on recent form smithe Rowe as been better
Not one Arsenal player gets in the Man City squad 😂 don’t support either club but Robbie lost this one
Expecting grealish to score loads of goals is like expecting modric or kroos to score loads of goals, they are all great players but arent attacking players
Can’t believe Robbie didn’t say Kieran tierney im a rangers fan aswell but he’s about The only arsenal player that has a shout to get in that city team.
I’d actually say Smith Rowe over Grealish based on current form this year. Think we all need to chill out about Grealish at the min.
I swear down I beg Man City to put Arsenal back to default settings cos all I see is Arsenal fans getting hyped for getting Top 4 in December so annoying
Sterling.                        Laca.                           Saka                                           Esr                   Fernandino.             Partey  Tierney.              Gabi.           Diaz.             Cancelo                                    Headerson
Saka and Smith Rowe are better than foden and grealish this season.
Arsenal invincibles drew 12 league games. That’s pretty average.
If city got so much money why cant they give that  fan a hair transplant 😂
Its so jarring when Arsenal fans bring the money thing into saying City 'bought' the trophies like say Arsenal hasn't spent a ton as well lol. Arsenal has been a banter club for so long that their fans can only cling onto the 'history' thing now lmao
Guardiola would possibly pick Gabriel over Laporte or Stones.
Kt would get in city
The Centurions would beat The Invincibles
Ramsdale getting into man citys team 😂😂😂 what is this man saying?
Man city not big club
Man City has fans???? I thought it was a myth, a legend, like Lochness's Monster or Bigfoot. With all those empty seats in every match, I thought they did not have fans.
Herbert Chapman built Arsenal. George Graham, best ever Arsenal manager who was in charge for the best ever title win, Anfield 1989 and doubles, winning Arsenals only European trophy. He built it all for Wenger to follow. It’s a shame Wenger failed in Europe, he doesn’t have a European trophy like all the elite manager do. Elite managers such as Brian Clough, Bob Paisley, Bill Shankly, Brian Clough. Even Pep and Klopp have got one
Fair play for finding a Man City fan.
Plssssss do city vs United
City fan deluded as per. Pep Guardiola is BIGGER than their whole club... how embarrassing.
People who talk about history think football started in the 80s
This city fan is so annoying
Against city this weekend                             Laca.                        Saka                                     Odegard                    Partey.                       Xhaka  Tevares.                                                           Tomi                 Tierney            Gabi.            White                                      Ramsdale
My man asked why smith Rowe didn’t turn up against city when we played 5 back with 10 men and had an atrocious defense with kolasinac at Center back 😂😂
“Arsenal fan” put some respect on the dons name yeah
"Robbi big team yeah👍🏿" ?Yeah man 👍🏿! I'm dead🤣
1. Arsenal are bigger now but city fan base is growing everyday so “will never be bigger” is false imo  2. Considering how much pep rotates the squad I agree with Robbie saka, smith Rowe and even tomyasu could be in the mix. Zinchenko gets games for city so could tomyasu.  3. Invincibles is very impressive it’s actually very disappointing that so many people try to pretend that it isn’t just because arsenal fans harp on about it. Wenger still had 90 points that season so the whole “38 draws and relegated” point is redundant and silly tbh
Big Steve is great
That was a really enjoyable 20 odd minutes never heard of that Man City bloke but you can tell he’s sensible had da don on da ropes a few times BIG UP DON ROBBIE
hes right
This guy is a joker, high on Oil money lol… the invincible team is the best football team in premiership ever, full stop and there won’t be any better… they tried to say Liverpool were and look how difficult it’s been for anyone to match that feat… the great Sir Alex said himself… nothing in football will ever match that, coming from the greatest premier league manager who won everything and the treble in 99, which still eludes Pep as he can’t win the champions league with all that Oil money, great team but we all know Pep would struggle in a lesser team with lesser resources… facts!
Robbie can only say the ‘small Club’ thing for probably another 3-4 seasons. Plastics around the world swarm to City, as they did to Arsenal in early 2000’s. So Robbie saying Arsenal are bigger around the world, won’t last long.
Robbie talking sense, City bought everything, doesn't feel the same as when the success is built from the ground up.
Arsenal fill 98% of their seats what is this endangered species talking about
Invincible or centurion who would of won the league? Exactly. Invincibles with 12 draws is hollow victory.
Arguing like kids
city will never be as big as arsenal big steve is just a giant cue ball
The reason you hate arsenal
Troopz made Arsenal relevant 😉
Erm… ESR is better than Grealish though 🤷‍♀️
City guy needs to be less delusional, Arsenal will always be a bigger club
Smith Rowe is far better Grealish was at age 20
It's literally only Chelsea and City fans that banter Arsenal and United fans  that talk about their history cause their clubs don't . I am a third generation Man United supporter, that is football heritage. It will take decades for Chelsea and City to even get close to the clubs Man United, Liverpool and Arsenal are.
Bukayo would be excellent at lb for city
Big Steve is spot on at the start especially. Saka doesn’t get no where near Foden, Mahrez or even Grealish. Saka has around 5 league goals in 2021, not good enough at the moment for a Guardiola team
Presenting to you the only Man city fan Big Steve
Personally I think best arguments for and against were pretty shocking, yes without the takeover Man City wouldn’t be where they are now, however you can’t put the consistent success down to that, for example, quite a few teams spend more than City such as Man United, thing is, City spend that money well and others are jealous that they wish they could do the same. Arsenal will always have well known history on there side but everyone does need to stop living in the past and should be wanting to win now. I think every club in the world would be better off with an owner, management team and youth building squad as well rounded as Man City’s but most owners still treat they’re club like a business.
The bigger club argument is for the former big clubs that fell off coz they have no trophies to bring up lol
Get into the squad match or starting 11...no way he thinks ESR starts ahead of Foden and Sterling on the LW position and Saka over Mahrez on the right
Robbie is high if he thinks those players are getting in that City team
Should have left during the 2015 fa cup, why as he won the same trophy 2 years later in 2017 but you say he should have left then but he left a year later in 2018 so don’t get it
We need more from outside of Europe like Barca vs Man Utd or Madrid vs Barca mix it up a bit
Man said Ramsdale and Smith-Rowe would get in the City team
The invincibles was done through winning the most games and drawing a few so the logic through going invincible drawing only is irreverent as nobody would be celebrating that
This should be on the history channel 😂😂😂 cringed the whole time Robbie was talking
Steve's banter is TOP!!  No one can forget Sweeeeing in the Car Park  😂😂
That man city feela was almost as hard work watching as the utd twat
I dont know how people say invincible was nothing average that team was the best team in premier league ... They were warriors and wtf is centutians i have not heard this thing formidables 🤦
So my question is who as better UCL pedigree man city or arsenal?  Answer:Nobody gives a Fuck😂
Man Utd have won the most premier league trophies and they're not 1st  Man City will be in the same situation in 10 years time from now  After those 10 trophies they'll be flat
Just seen the Wenger documentary and Ferguson said the invincibles stands above all else including his 13 titles
Smith rowe has been better than Grealish this season
Get a charity boxing match between these two super heavys
The only debate that Arsenal wins is the big club argument. Everything else is in City's favour. Arsenal cannot talk to City.
Man cannot talk disrespect about the Invincibles when no one else have ever done it before. When another club does it then you can talk
This is to funny!!!!! They are going in!!!!!😂😂😂😂
Not saying u don't love your team but u bought it simple
I'm Spurs fan, I 💯 agree with Robbie Arsenal. Facts is fact when it's comes to being a big club.
Both aren't big clubs, zero European pedigree
Arsenal fans think they are better than city🤣🤣 shit player, captain, owner and club😝
City have like 5 fans and they are all unbearable
Esr scored more goals than ronaldo this season at the moment
He just epitomises the man city fan base and I'm reminded of why I can't stand them.
Imagine this with a Messi fan and a Ronaldo Fan
about the big club debate, pick a random player from any big european club, just ask them which club u wanna join man city or arsenal, their answer will say it all which one is the bigger
So by his statement. City is a bigger club that United and Liverpool? Good joke pal!
Aubameyang up top ?????
arsenal 3-0 man city mark my words
Smith Rowe is better than Grealish
Everyone hating on grealish but forgetting rodri and cancelo took time to get use to the system…now they both are beast
This season Smith Rowe better than grealish....arsenal won all with out money man city have bought a team but pep has done it  at other clubs
We made City to the force they're right now. We built their club by selling them our first team players year after year  throughout the early stages of Sheikh Mansur takeover. And you have the audacity to sit there and claim you're a bigger club than us!? Chelsea is another club we have helped build.  Charity time is over at Arsenal. We're here to claim our rightful spot at the summit of the league table. Don't forget we won the league at Anfield Old Trafford and White Hart Lane twice it's also time they pay their rent to us we own their grounds 🤣🤣🤣. Arsenal will start acting like the bad boy of a club we are.
Only arsenal fans think arsenal is a big club.
Listen talk all u want went unbeaten standard don't give a fuck no team will do at why teams hate it
Lol 😂 got feeling Arsenal win it
Don’t even support City but Arsenal fans should keep quiet honestly…
In my opinion even as a United fan I reckon Gabriel has been better than Laporte this year and I still think Laporte been class as well but Gabriel been absolutely brilliant this year.
3:20 Arsenal would never drop to the though…
Big Steve and Robbie make a good duo. 💙❤️
4mins in and I'm loving it
Wow big Steve's arrogance, that's got to be an act he can't believe half the things he said
Man city fan bit delusional about man city being bigger, yes they are better but no where near the size.
I’m a Gooner but Robbie lost all the arguments: City are a bigger club now, trophies mean more than history, Saka ESR would struggle to get in City team. Edit: Last part was load of tosh, it doesn’t matter if you watched City in the division 4. The trophies were bought in a 10 year period spent like 2 billion on players. Embrace it
This city fan was a joke 😂😂 not even the biggest club in your own city mate piss off
Aaron Ramsdale 🤣🤣 ffs Robbie man
Says “Arsenal fan” as if we don’t know who this guy is.
Big up those chairs!
Is funny to watch this knowing how good mates Robbie and big steve are 🤣
Just tell me why many of arsnal players join man city if arsnal is bigger club,how mancity players wanted to join arsnal
Big Steve is a legend
That city fan needs to wind his neck in otherwise otherwise the dons henchman will burst in
As a football fan couldn't give a toss abt city 🤣🤣🤣
Does anyone notice how every city fan wears old jerseys? Trying to hide the fact they only started supporting them a few years ago!
why even ask robbie to be on this, hes never impartial & always biased. Im an arsenal fan but cmon stop overrating Ramsdale ESR saka when they havent achieved anything yet.
I find big club talk to be so irrelevant. I am an Arsenal fan and agree with Steve on this issue. I would rather win trophies.
Arsenal is true even though I'm spurs
Arsenal fans are deluded as per usual, the yute smith Rowe scores a couple of goals, now he is the best thing since sliced bread.
one thing pep should learn is that the longer he stays at city the harder it will be to find a suitable replacement
City are building the foundation..
well, hard to argue about the overall, since Grealish has been in "spotlight" longer than Smith-Rowe......  but at this moment, Smith-Rowe has definitely better form than Grealish......   don't know why City fans would have problem to admit that when it's true......   as an Arsenal fan, I have also no problem to admit that City are better squad......   both are quite evident at the moment
I’m a United fan but the city fan spoke facts saying you can draw all 38 games and go unbeaten they wouldn’t be the best team in the league the invincible team is one over rated team in premier league history
Smith Rowe is better
Robbie wid the breds😂😂 cmon
Imagine if everything was just purposefully done for the drama /viewings/money made from the upcoming Amazon documentary ... the performance turnaround, the previous out-of'the-blue bad performances after the unbeaten run,  auba drana,  manager touchline animaton etc.
Robbie always saying 'YoU bOuGhT It' but then cries that Arsenal and Kroenke don't do the same 🤷🏻‍♂️
Manchester City Without Pep Guardiola Is Just A Regular Premier League Team, but I guess money talks.
all of this just for arsenal to get destroyed at the emirates again lmfao
Arrogant little egg head 🥚 be nothing without 💰
This is so bad. I wish you could make it ressemble a bit more like A Game Of Two Halves that used to represent the pinnacle of Footballing debates. There should be a rule where each one expresses themselves in turn, and not turn into a cringefest
I’m an arsenal fan and I’m a bit disappointed as they can’t agree on anything
2 bold egg
As a city fan ramsdale never, he is good shot stopper but no-one will over take ederson place in the starting xi cus of his passing ability. And of course ederson make mitakes because everytime he tries to pass ball to his own players. Its fukin easy to avoid mistakes when you just kick longballs
I am a Man Utd fan but I like their points and statements which makes the debate more fun.
Arsenal invincible is trash...12 draws And robbie saying man city brought the titles, every premier league team has billionaire owners, what has your owners done for your club,  most owners dont care...
Robbie spitting fax
This season ESR has been better than Grealish, that may change, but I'm thinking ESR will go to the WC with England and Grealish will miss out. Man City will never be bigger than Arsenal- heritage matters and you can't buy that. Yes Man City are successful but they aren't even the biggest club in Manchester let alone England. When their owners move on or don't continue to spend billions City will return to being average, remember, just over 20 years ago they were in the 1st Division- that's the 3rd tier. They don't have the history to be a big club like Man Utd, Liverpool or Arsenal and definitely do not have the fanbase except for their diehard locals and foreign fans who chose them because they're successful atm. I'm English and in my 1st 30 years of my life I met 1 Man City fan- not a big club. Lastly, look at who the owners are and what their family do in their country- sexist, human rights abusers- they are despicable human beings with zero morality, just practising sportswashing, and the sooner democratic nations kick them and their ilk out the better- it's blood money.
Arguments are so shit from both sides
Smith Rowe has been far better than Grealish this season
Does anyone think they disagree on most questions and at the end the usually agree on the last question some questions both people could agree on but just disagree for the sake of getting views im not saying it doesnt work but iv watched most of the agree disagree but i think alot of questions could be agreed on by both people but i think they disagree scripted to do so
If it wasn't for the oil money, City would have been still stuck in the EF1. I mean, let's be honest every year, its the same thing now, City manages to be on the top of the league by December and wins the league with their high price tag players. At this point, the Premier League should add some restrictions to who can own teams.
Today, on another episode of "who can say the most outrageous footballing opinion they can think of..."
Man city are a money dependent club that's why they'll never be as big as arsenal were
Robbie is the most biased football fan around, bit fucking annoying to be honest
Robbie is making himself look a bit silly when he’s saying “you bought it” loads of teams have money
10:10 what a dumb statemnet wtf 😂 it's so much harder not making a single mistake an losing than winning mire games but losing more aswell
Gee whiz big Steve. Go for a run mate. You won't live long enough to see your boys lift their next trophy otherwise
Get a proper city fan,this ones a mug
I love how two guys that wouldn't be able to run 20 yards without having a heart attack are talking about soccer players being shit and whatever
Coming from a Man Utd fan, to say city will ‘never’ be as big as Arsenal or any other club is ridiculous. If they kept winning the title for the next 10-20 years they will 100% be bigger than a team like Arsenal if they continue to not win anything over the same period. Fans abroad in particular are fickle and would change clubs in a heartbeat to follow one that always wins, and don’t act like these clubs don’t currently count all their worldwide fans as part of why they are a ‘big club’. To say never is crazy.
Nobody respect Man City.
Someone tell steve city got half.the trophies than arsenal plus football existed before the 2010s😂
History will never forget that man citys current and future success will always be rooted down by money. They're not in there position because they earned it, but because they bought it, and that is why they will never have a better legacy than the likes of arsenal, Liverpool man utd etc.
How are people debating football in shirts that could fit two footballers? 💀 🤣
Arsenal is bigger than man city
This really showed how good the lads on the Spurs & West Ham one were. Had their heads screwed on (apart from saying Antonio is better than Kane) and were able to have a civilised debate
Someone would have to pay me £138 for me to agree to watch this video.
Should've been worded Smith-Rowe is currently "in better form" than Grealish. A lot of LW/AMs who aren't as talented as Jack are in better form currently.
Gabriel would start ahead of stones 100%
After the first Statement already you can't take the city fan serious 💀
Typical City fan.. cannot deny they have no history. The FIFA generation
Listening to Robbie sometimes is hard work - plays the same card “big club”, acknowledge 15 years Arsenal have been irrelevant. They may be a big club but they are no where near Man City, saying Ramsdale / ESR and Saka would get into Man City is ridiculous. Hearing him bang on about the invincibles is embarrassing - noone actually cares. Whats would you rather have? A champions league or invincibles?  Man is living in the past - Newcastle, Man City, Chelsea, Utd, Liverpool - any club which spends heavily do not care about anything but trophies and success, not sitting there saying “well 15 years ago we were massive and that means more than everyone else celebrating trophies” - stay living in the past Robbie, watch Newcastle be the next to overtake you
I’m not an Arsenal fan but I’ve never actually met a city fan 🤷🏾‍♂️
The delusion is strong with these, padwan.
Where was Man City just before the takeover.   Oh yeah getting whipped 8-1 by Middlesbrough.  I think the money helped them
Man City bigger than Arsenal? 🤣🤣. Good joke!
so this City fans 10 years ago wasnt watching footbal ? and after that they just start to love Man City ? :)))))) lol
Don't you ever refer to Don Robbie as "ARSENAL FAN." He eclipses your entire channel. Put some respect on that name.
How can you say city will NEVER be a bigger club than arsenal. They’re literally making history right now. 100 years from now all the titles city has won will be the history Robbie is talking about. City are on the upwards trajectory and will one day surpass arsenal.
This is whats needed man, i dont even care about football like that but its nice seeing fans from different clubs having genuine discussions about thieir teams and stuff
I'm a united fan but robbie is speaking facts man city will never be as big has arsenal, Liverpool, United bc they don't have history
Manchester City being a bigger club than Arsenal? LMAO!   They're not even a big club in their OWN city! LMFAO!!!
Ramsdale over Ederson I mean come on what is Robbie Smoking
This video should be called two men arguing about absolutely nothing.
these lot are so bald smh
Jack grealish is a flop. Smith rowe has been better. Coming from a spurs fan  Jack grealish<<<< maddison
city fan said they didnt buy all there trophies....  most deluded thing I have ever herd lmao
Ramsdale is currently 7th best keeper in the league for goals prevented with a 1.2, Ederson is currently 11th in the league for goals prevented with a -2.2. That deluded City fan needs to take the blinders off!!!😂😂
Arsenal man pissed up as normal lol better than Grealish
Combined City/Arsenal team:  GK: Ramsdale RB: Walker CB: Dias CB: Stones/Laporte LB: Cancelo CDM: Rodri CM: De Bruyne CM: Bernardo Silva RW: Mahrez False 9: Foden LW: Sterling  I was thinking about where to put Smith-Rowe
Robbie does not know the difference between a player in good form and a good player. Grealish is better than ESR but ESR is in good form. This doesn’t mean he’s a better player than Grealish
Gabriel, Saka, Smith-Rowe and Partey get into the Shitty team, 100%. Give it 2 years and you can add Saliba, Tomiyasu, White, Tierney, Martinelli and Odergaard as well.
Ederson been a bit shaky? No he hasn't
Little gold trophy out of a kinder egg he's hilarious 😂😂
Did Robbie really say what have you built 😂
I'm a spurs fan but i really like robbie he is always the most reasonable one in the farce show that is AFTV
When Guardiola leaves they will go downhill, 100%.
Robbies such a nice guy but quite allot of the time he's either delusional or misinterprets allot of the things put forward. History history history....in 10/20 years the present will be history, therefore citys history will without a doubt be bigger than arsenal, And may even end up bigger than manchester united and liverpool....Fanbases are based upon success.....if you dont have success that fanbase will gradually decline. Arsenal have fans around the world based off 2001-2004, You arn't going to get kids 7 or 8 years old watching the invincible season DVD going dad i want to be a arsenal fan, Everytime city goes out and thrashes someone 5-0, 6-0 they are gaining fans.
I'm not surprised it's the leader of arsenal fan tv.
The city man would sell his arse for money
Blackpink is the revolution
Don Steve in the building!!💙
Ok well take away grealish, smith rowe isnt better than foden and saka isnt better than bernardo and ederson just is better than ramsdale
Recency bias is prevalent with people whom think Smith Rowe is better than Grealish.
Ur famous for hot dogs, youtube views and banta 😂😂
Big Up BIG STEVE 💙💪
Robbie can’t be serious
Don Robbie
I remember when Arsenal being 4th was a meme and now it's a dream.
It’s like the Spider-Man meme
Love seeing the Don in the morning
All these Arsenal fans getting too gassed with their recent performances. Grealish ability wise is clear of ESR. No debate
That man City fan looks like a nonce
Smith Rowe is way better than Grealish smh
