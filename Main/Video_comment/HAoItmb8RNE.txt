Ucl final and for contry what a year for kai havertz
Spoiler alert.
Where is sane
0:58 How did Rudiger fail to keep that out? 😂😂
Neuer could have easily gotten that first header if he actually raised his arms 😂
As a Chelsea fan seeing both Werner and Havertz score is wicked, this leaves me optimistic for their return to the PL.
Not sure the fascination with Kimmich, he's just a German Jordan Henderson. Not that either play are bad footballers but Jordan Henderson gets stick whilst Kimmich gets praise when he plays the exact same role in CM. Clean up a bit, play a simple pass to the left or right.
Amazing the comments on here if. It was England they are a joke but Germany best team in the world!!!
Chelsea fans: this is what Werner and Kai can do playing in their best position. Don't forget that now that they seem to be 'struggling' under a system that can't accommodate them.
Germany 🇩🇪 was a EVIL country

Timo Werner will be premier league top scorer,get your bets on now,you heard it hear first,thank me next summer!!
Harry "Oil Tanker" Maguire to the ref. "Do you know who I am? I am the captain of Manchester United, I am very rich, I can give you money, I can pay you, please don't send me off." Ref to the Oil Tanker " Your game is over"
how did sommer not save Werner's  goal
havertz wener pulisic ziyech mount chelsea will rise
Let’s be honest I love England, but we’re not even top 10 for the past 5 years.
Rudiger 😭🤣😂
The goals scored in this match were next level!
neuer is so overrated lol
where is Rudigers assault with elbow , why isnt that shown, lets guess
The last two goals were out of the top drawer.
Please welcome the 3-3 2020-21 boys , Havertz and Werner !!
Clever goals from both sides.
3-3? Bloody hell Germany, you're equalling the Swiss!
Gnabry is ripping it up, has been for a long time, doesnt get enough mention!
Gnabry 🔥🔥🔥
Swiss are on a roll.
The fact kimmich acc jumped to try and save the 3rd suiss goal show how true he is not many people would do that 🤷‍♂️
Germany and Spain have a long way to go... Still think that Low retiring Müller, Hummels and Boeteng early was a shocking decision considering the season that the first two have had
Is Neuer Overrated?
Always great to see a player who makes a mistake and loses the ball but busts a gut to get back and make amends...  ... and then there’s Shaquiri
Rudiger 👎🏾
Chelsea fans : This is great 😄 People who watched the misses and awful passes: ?
I’m a chelsea fan. The only player that isn’t good rn is rudiger. So stop dissing Werner and havertz u wet yute
These two players can’t even score for Chelsea lol especially timo waste of money 😂😂😂
Havertz will probs get an inform
John Abraham is a legend
Germany's defence is a shambles
Germany cant defend properly at all
Germany will not make it out that group of death in Euro 2021 it’s gonna get long for them
Chelsea fans next weekend  losing 3 nil  😬🤕😱🤣 YNWA come on the super reds back to back keep the premier league title Lampard and his Chelsea fighting tooth and nail for survival 7 place at best no hire guaranted but that's what you get for buying your greed jealous of klopp and  our liverpool team Lampard in a nightmare our fans living the dream .💯🏆🥇all my lfc companions stay strong peace out 👋
great game
Germany a thing of beauty
Havetz looking fresh as ever
I was genuinely so confused with the Swiss 2nd goal. Is there an explanation for what Rüdiger was doing 😂😂😂
Germany are looking weak right now... best put some money on them winning the nation's league. 😂
Wow Germany are crap now
Can’t believe Germany payed 5k for that goal music
I watched this in my grandma's chalet in the swiss Alps and when we equalised I celebrated with a bar of toblerone
Why does sky use the French spelling of Switzerland?
Portugal and France are gonna destroy Germany at the Euros.
Are we just going to ignore Freuler filth chip; against Neuer no less.
There's something about Neuer conceding that makes me happy
Why Switzerland letters lowercase
Awful defending by Rudiger,turned his back on a weak cross that led to a goal and should have stopped it..That's why he aint getting in the Chelsea side any longer
Werner and Havertz for Germany: 🦁 Werner and Havertz for Chelsea: 😿
I don’t like to spoil anyone’s party but I’m quite confident all 20 main premier league goalkeepers would have saved Werners shot
Havertz loves finding his level against bang-average teams
THAT WAS A BRILLIANT GAME THE SUISS ARE VERY GOOD DARK HORSES
:)
At least we can see Rudiger is just as bad for his country as he is for his club
Gnabry is so underrated , what a player he is
So when can they do this for chelsea
Albanian and others immigrates vs germany
Apart from neuer, Can, Kross and , rudiger  this must be one of the youngest squads Germany have put out in a long time. Same with the Turkey game.
Germany’s back line isn’t good enough to challenge for the European Championship next year.
finally found a keeper worse than adrian... thanks switzerland
great goal by Havertz. he looks so silky on the ball.
@Sky Sports Football how was Shaqiri allowed to play when i thought he had covid19 and still has to self isolate ???
I don’t get how they’re not playing sane
gnabry must be worth at least 200 million
Shocking swiss defending.
Germany looked like they played Rudigar in defence.
Maybe werner and havertz only want to score past bundesliga keepers?
Great gnabry goal💯.... icie moss side Manchester city 💙
How many serbs and kosovars are in that swiss team😂
1:15 What did Rudigër Try to do?
Lampard should take notes
Germany defence not all that
Me as a Chelsea fan 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Sky sports: Werner and Havertz score   The other goalscorers: 😡🤬    Also they overrate chelsea so much  Edit Gnabrys goal was the best
Why does the goal seem so big in this game
Guys Germany let in 3 with the best goalkeeper in the world imagine if Neuer was injured 🤕
Do this at chelsea Haverts and werner
Lol
Swiss second goal absolutely awesome
Shame for Chelsea fans that Lampard bought these guys without knowing what he was gunna do with them
I am a Chelsea fan
3:52 cheeky cheeky
Can goretzka come under 40k ffs
Germany ain’t scary opponents anymore they’re average they seem to really struggle nowadays
I think for Chelsea havertz will be better than Werner
lol Gnabry scores a stunner but sky sports promoting Chelsea agenda 🤦‍♂️
Haverts and Werner should join a bigger team like Man Utd
worst German team in my lifetime
"Chelsea fans right now?" Have you not seen Chelsea's defence recently? Maybe Havertz and Timo Werner can also play as Central Defenders. 😲😲
Germany will not be winning anything important with that defence. (and yes, I watched the whole game live) 🤔. Switzerland are about the 8th to 12th best country in Europe. So if Germany are struggling to defeat Switzerland at home, then I am not optimistic about the European Championships. Germany's defence is an issue and it is now rare for them to keep a clean sheet.
As an Arsenal seeing Serge Gnabry turn into the player he is today really warms my heart but at the same time I miss him
Serge will be just like Lewandowski when he goes.
All the top countries underperforming, England beating the world number ones, favourites for the euros. Wtf is going on
Bayern Munich play better  football than Germany
Every goal was class
entertaining
Title: *WERNER AND HAVERTZ*  Gnabry who  scored the best goal:  😑
Rudiger my salone broder, what was that?, loooool!!
timo will do it in the epl, havertz won't...sorry i just don't see it in him.
Joachim needs to select their workhorse engine, Thomas Muller.
no muller no win,simply as that,only gnabry is the a real tanky aggresive player that germany use to play before,neuer needs to retire,he was never a great gk,hes hanging on bayerns name but never spectacular
That headline is awful. As if Germany won the game or something
Havertz just casually juggling the ball to goal and then finishes like it's nothing 😆
Choose your difficulty setting on Fifa -  Amateur Semi Semi-pro Professional Legendary Aston Villegendery Bayern Monstrous
Germany's manger needs to get the boot, he's won one game in 2020 against Ukraine. He should of been sacked after the World Cup 2018
Man Untieds a joke
Only time I watch International Football is when I see Werner and Havertz play.   And of course... The legend himself...  HUSTLE Merchant!
Chelsea really dominating the German game here, in both scoring the goals and giving them away
Chelsea fans: I see this as an absolute win!
German defense is a shambles.
How many times did the German midfield gift the ball to the Swiss? Not sure about this German side just yet but they have been written off before.
Rudiger is out of position for each of the goals. My god that is terrible defending. 1st Goal - he plays them all onside - doesn't move with his line 2nd Goal - he is too far forward and doesn't cover the space on the break. Pause at 0:53, he should be looking to check his right and sprint to cover that space cutting off the 3 on 2 (though his left back was up too far also, as the CB he should have been marshalling the shape on that side) 3rd Goal - Pause at 3:17 he is in no-man's land.  Could actually park a bus between the RCB and LB.  Then doesn't at 3:19  track the 9, or cut off the pass to the 9. After the 9 gets in he doesn't react or close the second or third attempt.  Again, some blame can't be levelled on the left back for keeping the 9 onside but  as the CB, Rudiger should have kept the shape so the left back can keep the line.   His reactions are slow but his positioning is terrible. It's almost as if he is used to a CB partner taking the lead on shape, offside line but his reactions are woeful. He doesn't seem to know where to be covering the space especially on a break
That 2nd for the Swiss 😍 Dinky-Doo.....⚽️
you have to feel for neuer. going from 2014 world cup winners hummels and boateng as his cb’s to ginter and rudiger the absolute bottlejobs
Werner and Havertz just in that chelsea “3” spirit
no defending just vibes
Klopp   spoilt   shaqri's   career !
Yess Werner and Kai Havertz. Incoming hate on Werner and Havertz still a thing.🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️ Can't wait when both shush them in the coming days i.a
🤔😏😴
Even maguire can defend better than rudiger. Now we all know what Maguires capable of 😂😂
This comment section is just full of Chelsea fans licking out havertz and Werner
Vexed that I chose to watch Ukraine vs Spain instead of this🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
No Swiss players mentioned in the title but two German players?...and it was 3-3.
Germany’s attack was very good
feeling sorry for Neuer. he made some very good saves. 3 goals from Switzerland were unstoppable. Its very strange why know one talks about nowadays he was on top of the world at one point
Rudiger is poor with more effort and desire he could of prevented all 3 of Switzerlands goals.
If Fifa 21 was a real life game☠️☠️😂😂
John Abraham do be lurking in the comments
Germany’s back line looking as solid as the Berlin Wall right now.
Some neat finishing tonight Switzerland second goal 👏👏
At this point I skip over comments which end like this.......
And this, is why Neuer is overrated. Comes out when he doesn't need to and concedes half chances.
Werners goal was like playing Fifa when your sweaty finger slips off the shoot button too soon 😂
Shaqiri with the hair transplant lol
Why is no one talking about Gnabry's goal
Havertz is class no matter how much hate he gets. He’s 21 and as you can see amazing for his age. Werner is getting better with Chelsea too.
Lol imagine not even beating fricking Switzerland dumbass Chelsea Everton will clap you
Pourqoi Drmic n'est joue pas?
Let’s hope Werner and Havertz both perform this good or better at Chelsea
Something weird happened in this game no one is talking about is that nuar was chipped twice.
ffs neuer 😂
Chelsea fans  are in a frenzy right now 😂😂
Why are there so many Werner and Havertz haters? I am sure that this game will give them confidence for Southampton at the weekend and beyond
What's happened to Germany... maybe it's time to replace Löw
"The Swiss have the Germans right where they want them"  1943 Newspaper - "I don't remember that one"
Ka Havertz over international break - 2 goals, 3 assists
Lampard needs to look at the position that havertz and Werner are playing
Dislike 👎
Why cant they do this for chelsea
"Delightful!"
Fabian Schar was poor, Newcastle fans should be worried.
Doesn't matter if Germany come bottom and get "relegated"... just rearrange the tournament and have them in tier 1 again.
Rudiger 😂
If Germany don't sack Löwe after the Euros then they'll never win anything again. Like Wenger and now Diego Simeone at Atletico, Lowe's past achievements is allowing him to overstay his welcome to the detriment of his team who are in need of a new direction.
Havertz and Werner are just getting used to the prem...
*Toni Kroos was brilliant tonight, left foot, right foot he has it all*
Are any of the swiss players swiss?
Gut das Shaqiri entlich wieder besser spielt
Honestly can’t see Germany beating either a Portugal or France
Gnabry scored too
Chum jezt Schwitz
That German defence had more holes in it than Swiss cheese!
Germany can’t stop drawing
Havertz was playing as an RM in a 4-2-3-1 formation here
Shaqiri is amazing on his day
Havertz's future.. probably win everything at Chelsea by 27. and Real Madrid comes and buys him for 300mill+!!
Neuer should have defiantly done better for first and collected the second the ball of the second goal
Shaqiri very good tonight
Ngl Havertz Is going to become one of the best players In the world And I’m not even Being Biased Coz I’m a Liverpool fan
Only a matter of time before they start tearing it up at Chelsea. Kai and Timo are special ballers 💙
Come on Chelsea!!
How is low still the coach of this team 😭
Werner will flop at Chelsea, but havertz will become world class. Mark my words
People forget Havertz is 21. Imagine him in his prime
havertz for germany 10/10 werner for germany 10/10 both for chelsea 3/10
Neuer is absolutely awful
Germany attack is great, but that defence is a tragedy, we’re talking grenfall and 911.
Absolutely terrible defending, this is what happens when you rely on Rudiger. The Germans look unrecognisable to the team that won in 2014. Very inefficient performance. Löwe has to go...
Werner and Havertz haters incoming 😂😂
Havertz and Werner 😍
All you see in the football highlight comment section are discount John Abraham who is a discount Amitabh Bachchan, the wannabe trolls.
What an amazing game.
Still have a feeling both will flop for Chelsea, I don't know why.
Germany have drew every game so far
As a Chelsea fan, the timo and Kai combo makes me excited 🔥
Gnarby proving us Arsenal fans why we should have never let him go.
Germany are rubbish when lewandowski isn't playing
Germany             3-3 draws                     🤝
LORD JESUS IS COMING SOON  One TRUE GOD came as human being and died for our sins. He offers everlasting life in Paradise as a free Gift. Titus 2:23 while we wait for the blessed hope--the appearing of the glory of our great GOD and SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST.
Werner gets 1 more week in my FPL team...
Havertz n Werner 💙🔥
Germany are so washed Löw needs to stop sniffing his bollocks
Gnabry is so cheeky
What a performance from Havertz! His confidence is starting to build up.
Now do that for Chelsea you bellends
The Chelsea boys at it hope to them bag a few in the prem
Leno should have played
Havertz and werner haters will still criticise them loooool
I’m a Chelsea fan and half German so this is brilliant for me as a Chelsea fan but also as the German side of me we should be doing better but I will take a point but probs to Switzerland as they played amazing
LETS GOOO CHELSEA ON TOP
I pray Rudiger never starts for Chelsea 0:57 what the hell 😆😆😂😂
we don’t care where is the san marino game
If u like this you are a weapon of war
Fifa 21 career mode
Imagine Chelsea in peak form when everyone is fit,😳
how many times chelsea players on titile?
This Germany side is probably the weakest squad they have had in a long time
Like baCk. 👏👏 Thank you.🥰 Keep Going. 🙏🏻
Big up to the Chelsea players
This is the amount of goals & assists Werner and Havertz will get for Chelsea combined this season. 👇
Can I have mad likes on this comment for no apparent reason lol?
Before 100 comments
Here comes the Chelsea fans trying to hype up their flops.....
Also a bizarre scoreline for San Marino tonight 0-0 against Liechtenstein
Rudiger is awful I'm sorry but it's true
The font on the back of the Switzerland kits is fire
Love your vids keep up the cracking work
Switzerland are a team to look out for very underrated
Germany need to clean up in defence if they want a chance against teams like France portugal and Italy
Hi
Chelsea
Too bad for chelsea fans, this is the only time you'll see havertz and werner link up and score. They love performing well, when they're not playing in the prem.........
Draw🥶🥶🥶
Kai and Timo are the best partnership is the best in CHELSEA even in Germany
They can do it for Germany but not Chelsea
Why are havertz and werner being ballers everywhere but for Chelsea? 😂
Rudiger was terrible today. Germany would've won 3-0 if it weren't for that clown
Nice to see more premier league players
Havertz and Werner will shine at Chelsea
Just give me likes and fast
Remarkable scoreline for Switzerland
First
Good game
I’m just hoping both Werner & Havertz can bring this to the premier league
If werner and havertz could do it in the prem
Yes werner 💥🔥🏆
Cant wait till ziyech plays trust me havertz and werner will only be getting better
First
Jeez what a game 😳😳😳
How does Rudiger make the starting lineup? Awful player..
Yes chelsea
