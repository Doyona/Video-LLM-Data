Why do they cut it off with Bout and Griner? 🤔
Viktor Bout probably like wth a vape pen and what is a WNBA 😂
What the USA did in NBA terms is trade Victor Wembanyama and 10 unprotected first round picks to the Los Angeles Lakers for Bronny James💀💀💀
Good news everyone. Viktor bout sold all the weapons to the huti rebels which bombed American ships
Crazy how US only had two options, Biden or Trump. You guys sure like pedos a lot.
A man responsible for untold millions of deaths around the world with his arms sales, is set free for a 6’8” WNBA player who got caught smuggling drugs. Idc if it’s weed, doing  a little time for drugs vs releasing this man is nauseating!
Let's trade man for man ......wait womannnnn😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The US should have left britney in Russia this lowlife doesn’t care about our Country National Anthem or our Flag
No way
Should of left him in jail
why didnt they show Griner actually shaking hands with " The Merchant of Death"?
Why is there no autocomplete for "Viktor Bout Britnney Griner"? Does youtube not want people knowing about this amazing moment of freedom?  Does youtube itself think trading a WBNA player for the most wanted arms dealer in history was bad?
Worst prisoner exchange in History, Thanks Biden. Trump 🇺🇸 was in office. This trade would’ve never happened
Their country their laws. Like every time I break laws I’m doing it with full awareness of the consequences. She should have done her time like the man she is. Chump
This is the moment we all shoulda known how imbalanced global trading really is
10-7 russia
Notice how they cut the part out where he shakes hands with Britney
That’s actually crazy,  the Biden administration was hilariously spineless
Pretty sure at one point Bout had to think "Well that actually happened..."
Not worth it
In other similar news , Real Madrid trades Mbappe for Juansito from the slums
It's because she's a black female lesbian. That's why. Biden likes them.
отдай мне крысу, и ты свободен идти
"Soon there's going to be a knock on that door and you will be called outside. In the hall there will be a man who out-ranks you. First he'll compliment you on the fine job you've done - on you making the world a safer place. That you're to receive a commendation or a promotion. And then he's going to tell you that I am to be released. You're going to protest. You'll probably threaten to resign.   But in the end, I *will* be released. The reason I'll be released is the same reason you think I'll be convicted. I do rub shoulders with some of the most vile, sadistic men calling themselves leaders today. But some of those men are the enemies of your enemies.   And while the biggest arms dealer in the world is your boss, the President of the United States, who ships more merchandise in a day than I do in a year, sometimes it's embarrassing to have his fingerprints on the guns. Sometimes he needs a freelancer like me to supply forces he can't be seen supplying. So, *you* call me evil, but unfortunately for you, I'm a necessary evil."
🤔 transgender goes free so a arms dealer can go gree and continue selling weapons.......
It's like changing a shoe in exchange for a mansion
she’s very very lucky she’s famous cuz if that wasn’t the case she would’ve been stuck there because united states doesn’t negotiate with terrorist
Putin is so smart how can you change madza😢323 and a Bugatti veron
That’s Crazy… Welp WW3 here we come but it’s gonna be Trumps fault if it does. How? Idk I’m not a Lesbian Black Wizard with Illusion 😮class that’s level 12 0:27
for a vape pen and we got a Lord of War sequel it's either the worst or the best trade deal in the history of man.
Добро пожаловать домой, Виктор!
Soo many people in the world are now going to die because of this stupid crappy basketball player!…sick part is the Biden administration still hasn’t gotten out us soldiers in Russias prison! But we traded for this stupid bum!!
Like kids trading their packed lunch for a half consumed lunchables
The fact that she wouldn’t even stand for the national anthem. Russia should have kept her
They are literally soldiers caught on duty in Russias jail but the democrats went yeah we’d like our basketball girl back before the Olympics 🤣🤣🤣.
The USA is weak. Their whole empire is on the brink of collapse.
The biggest trade in WNBA history.
Vote Trump
Idk but biden the worst human being on earth to let that guy out for exchange for women trying so hard to act like a nba man clown looking ahh. That man probably murdered families and has secrets could be nuclear
Kinda convenient he was released when Russia had just went to war.
Probably the only trade in the WNBA anybody payed attention too.
In GPU terms, this is like going from 4090 to a 1060 (3GB).
unbelievable 😂💀
CIA and Russian intelligence who were shaking hands
Us got played nicely
What’s funny. Is this man was spotted doing a ARMS TRADE with houthis from Lebanon buying missiles from him in Russia. He’s back to doing what he does best…… funding war. And griner? Back to being a useless basketball player who’s worse than our college basketball men
Hahahahahahaha
Sad we left a Marine and a teacher behind😢😢😢😢 Griner is a dude.
"Watching each and every single WNBA matches live" should be in his release clause.
Remember this when anyone mentions "White Privilege". Because if any non famous white person was in her position we would still be sitting in a Russian prison.
Where is the raw footage? Why the edit?
Democrats are such an embarrassment to the free world
While Russia plays chess the United States are playing marbles
Gay giraffe for Merchant of Death.
Griner is a female basketballer?
Who's the dude in the red coat?
I suppose Bout eats to much - can't afford his containment. That's the only reason why they may want to drop him😂😂
Get ready boys we are getting lord of war 2 soon😂
I thought it's only happening in showbiz/movies.
She's a traitor
Absolute worst prisoner exchange in the history of the United States. Mind you the United States could have brought home the journalist who were imprisoned as well as Brittany, but they chose not to and got played.
Pure bullshit. A delusional homo for a murderer. Makes sense.
Weird how you edit out the handshakes
The only time a WNBA trade has ever made headlines
Looks like a man
So restarted.
Should’ve left this wannabe dude in Russia. Traded a valuable prisoner for her/it is beyond dumb
Brittney is a dude.  What a horrible trade.
a Toyota for a Lambo.  Ok whatever.
A dude for a dude...just look at his walk geez!!!
Her best move in her entire WNBA "career".
Stupid decision
Now you know how Russians roll 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂big prayers
Unpopular opinion, but it was a fair trade. Both were political prisoners.
If you still vote for Joe Biden after this, you are a fool.
Was Biden in his right mind when he traded Viktor Bout for Brittney?
Bartow arena seth varney jason Powers van hom tomy thomas flbriils baker probably dtill owe the Russians for uab basketball gsnes they gambled on and lost.  Deena katsoilas greek volleyball okayer involved in gane fixing like the rest of them erre at the time.

That's what happen when you have stupid president 😂😂😂😂 let's go biden.
An entitled black lesbian who beats her spouse and hates her country is finally held accountable. It results in the worlds most prolific arms dealer going free. Unreal
It really shows that russia doesn't take biden seriously  It was supposed to be 2 prisoners for a high valued arms dealer   But it became only 1, and thats Britney who's a pot head
Back in business I see
She's a traitor look at her tattoos she has a star in each of her shoulders she's Russian mob this was planned this was staged United States got played
Worst trade of all time! Should've just kept him with the russians.
I still can’t believe the United States did this.
I'm not a geopolitic specialist, but this is probably the dumbest swap of prisoners in recorded history.
Ayy Liberals, Look At What Your Biden Did Ya Genderless Pr١ck
"Aye Viktor we fucked them" 😂
Best NBA player in the world 😂😂😂
Christianity
Russia won that one for sure.
That’s a bunch of shady guys and a WNBA player.
Now even....for Alaska.
I got a feeling he is going to get locked up again.
Это офигеть, нам преступника на должность в правительстве уже кстати а им спортсменку глупую
Exchanging one dude for another dude
God what a humiliating moment for our country......
kzBcGUs4
Them Boys So Happy To Have Him Look At That Hug Smh
That's a man
Fresh arrival of Ukrainians weapons for various African conflicts. Viktor Bout is the most important independent arm provider for the largest African conflicts - Angola, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Congo (5 million deaths) and also for Al-Qaeda, Taliban, Yougoslavia wars
Americans most messed up and fucked up move no wonder America is falling.
We exchanged a IT,for a real man trained killer..sadd days
My God, can you imagine the laughter in Russia when that deal was completed?
America sure love the trans
Strange comments really, i only admit most of people leaving comments do not understand what it is like to be in russian prison where a person is tortured, humiliated and can be killed without any concequences for prisoners. A girl is saved from nightmare and no one can count her life for 1 us dollar or whatever.
I like how they had to label who was who 😅
We exchanged a basketball player who broke the law, for a war criminal and we left behind a US Marine who was sentence to 16 years for suppose espionage. We left behind a US soldier  for a basketball player who definitely broke the law. This is ridiculous. What a joke
We the American people do not agree with this. # Brittany go back!  Put her in jail here to serve her sentence, people here be serving time for weed ! What up .......
Just like in Lord of War 😂😂😂🤣amazing this guy is the realest
He isn't actually a war criminal dude... People lie he's a gun trades man... Then every person that owns a gun store in America should be labeled a war criminal...
THIS WAS ALL A SET UP TO GET HIM BACK IN THE FIRST PLACE!!🤔🤨😒🧐
biggest mistake made for humanity… This guys going right back to work…
Biden was senile to exchange Victor Bout the Merchant of Death for a US basketball player.
Gambino columbos others im still being threatened circlle gift card scam  ticket loaders which i am not clepto fugitive s in Montgomery Al just shows how police in the rake these days security companies too and lawyers bankers
Montgomery Al is getting desperate
Mike Johnson desperate trump desperate Biden desperate bob menendez desperate john thune desperate Mississippi desperate where my children are religious cults have started up against my children which is blackmail.  Serenity jones others Eastern contracting d r Horton witness tampering bribery
Assange desperate
G.I. Joe- “We’ll give you back Destro, your arms supplier, for our receptionist you kidnapped.”  Cobra- “DEAL!”
Lmao😂😂 when I first saw this I thought this was a wedding
Only WNBA trade anyone has ever heard about
Almost like it was all set up, just in time for a war involving Russia..weird.
What the hell.
Where's brittney though?😮
What a racket
I'm more interested in who the dudes shaking hands are, real playas
This is wnba best trade so far
This feels like a slave trade to me 😅..
This never should have taken place
Two guys
Why is a Arab dude there
We fr traded a merchant of death for some random black transexual
🫣
This is like trading black mamba for white mamba haha
Based
The worst part about this is that Bout is responsible for genocide in Africa and she happens to be African American.  She had no idea who he is and what he is capable of.
It looks like him and Griner shook hands but they removed it. A sign that both him and Griner have basic courtesy.
This will go down as the worst trade is basketball history.
straight out of a South Park episode
Its like trading a rock for a diamond or some sht
Russians played this one beautifully.   Despite the fact that that Brittney whatever her name is a nothing more than a pot smoking butt ugly baboon they knew that it would prove valuable in getting whatever they want from the stupid State Department.   Enter Victor Bout into the equation, a very valuable arms dealer that they now own & which they leveraged into getting released because Americans love their baboons no matter what they do.    Stupid Americans.
This is one reason I'll NEVER vote for Biden.
lol the merchant of death for a basketball player who likes to smoke weed. america is so fucked up
Who is the sheik?
The most pathetic movement that America has done.
USA will trade their existence for LGBTQ agenda. 😂
The biggest trade in WNBA history
His nickname was MERCENT OF DEATH.
I paused this so I did t have to watch it it makes me to mad she is human garbage she deserves to still be in Russia and our American soldiers should be coming home not that pos and we have them back a monster I will never understand why they made this decision she plays basketball that like 12 people watch she’s not an important person I bet if me or u got lucked up over there u know damn we will would still be there
Only 1 question - how?
The Biden administration is disgustingly shameless eww
Cant belive you yanks did this. He is one of the worlds most dangerous men
This is just another screw up of Joe Biden.
Officially a worse trade than the Herschel Walker trade
Victor Bout played it like Nick Cage
Brooo
This is worse than the Broncos trade for Russell Wilson
This is Fuckin ridiculous. The rest of us would get one hour visit from American ambassador’s staffer. But you exchange her for a guy we spend millions for tracking and prosecuting? The “ Lord of war” himself?
I still can't believe this fuckin happened.
Sure ill trade my Mantle RC for your 2nd year Sandy Alomar😅
What a sick joke
Six foot, eight inches tall is almost UNHEARD of, in a Woman. I wonder if she was not put on an Aromatase Inhibitor, just before Puberty. Estrogen causes the skeletal growth plates to close in Both genders-(in us Dudes, Testosterone is metabolized to Estrogen.)  Giving that Drug (which is legitimately used to treat Breast Cancer) would cause a significant increase in Height.   That is why Klinefelter men (tiny balls, small muscles) are often Very Tall.  I am SURE that there are Klinefelter Men in both the NBA and NFL. They would simply need to take Anabolic Steroids, in  the "Off Season" after Puberty, to Bulk Up.
Now the Russian s have a say in women s pro sports lol...
Why did the united states government exchange a serial killer for a female basketball player? 👁️
Disgusting
I'm glad Brittney is safe.
They traded that america hating mediocre wnba player for a dangerous arms dealer? Wow
WTF
us govt knows its citizens, they know americans will not do anything to stop the trade so..... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Welcome back home comrade!
Imagine trading a literal Merchant of Death who probably caused the death of around 10k people for a crack head.  Oh, you don't have to imagine it happened!
Looks like they cut the video right when Britney Griner was about to shake his hand. What a shame the lengths we’ll go for someone who publicly hates America. Can’t believe we left Paul Whalen over there but we fight so hard to get her back. I bet she’s gonna keep her mouth shut now.
Nobody in America wants her back.  She hates America
Russia was like  "Hey Joe, if you give us a Rolls Royce, we'll give you a Ford Pinto. How does that sound?" Biden was like  "It's a deal!"
Her freedom came too high of a price.
Disgusting.
Worst trade in Basketball history.
Blinken is just slav to accept that😂
Dumbest trade off ever, way to go USA
This is some bs. PAUL WHELAN should of been exchanged not BRITTANY I’m not saying she should if not been released, but he deserves to be out
Imagine trading some nicknamed "*THE MERCHANT OF DEATH*" for  a Wnba basketball plaher who smuggled drugs to a country and didnt even stand for its anthem.
There are several ways to belt a cat. Likewise, you employ the same strategy to deal with a bully. Well done Iran, for getting your own asset unfrozen. Now remove all your assets from western banks.  How the USA made it's bed that's how they will sleep.
What a terrific deal for us...WNBA fans around the world must have been ecstatic!!! All 83 of them 🤷‍♂️
“all fun and games huh?” & now what? attachments? write? we’ll see what happens.
Why would they edit the handshake? The government doesn't want us to realize we're all just pawns for their power struggles
Imagine being the people that risked their lives to get that arms dealer.
Brenton Griner
what a f clownada
Russia took a massive W there lmfao
LETS SELL SOME AKS AND RPGS it’s been long enough
I bet Griner has no clue who he is.
No single individual (especially a president) should ever be allowed to order a prisoner swap that involves taxpayer money, convicted criminals or spies, or the release of foreign funds.   Any such swap should require an approval of the majority of the house and a minimum 60 vote majority in the senate.  As with pardons, I would always be a firm no vote.  Americans that choose to desert their posts, that choose to enter countries that re at the least adversarial towards the US, or out right enemies get what they deserve.  I have no sympathy for them.  None.
He is walking like, "I'm back bitches"😂
This is the equivalent of me trading my special mew card for some cool looking normal Pokémon
The U.S. will forever see her equilivent to a russian felon. That's embarrassing. She knowingly committed a crime in another country. She should be ashamed of herself. Good job representing the U.S. by a U.S. drug smuggler....correction, "athlete." Meanwhile, a MARINE still sits in a russian prison.
This is the best trade ever being done in WNBA history! Good Viktor in your new WNBA team!
Esa negra es también espía transexual , obviamente el intercambio de espías fue justo.
The only WNBA trade that anyone has ever payed attention to; and it was a terrible trade at that.
Our government is definitely involved with the cartels
They trade the merchant of de.ath for basketball lesbian,  it's just like exchanging a  luxurious mansion for a golden toilet seat 🚽 ... America ☕️ 🇺🇸
I’m watching basketball all my life, this is the only WNBA trade that I ever noticed
It's all Trump's fault!
A Black LGBTQ+ being exchanged for a "Merchant of death" 😢. What happened to the spies who got caught and sent into prison of Russia. At least they were doing it for their country.
Viktor Bout be like : " I am back, doing what I do best".
A complete travesty.
No way this is a woman and if I talk about the way it walks, I will have troubles
Biden is the stupidest president I've ever seen, what would make us think we should trade an arms dealer responsible for American deaths for a woman who brought weed into/out of Russia? I suppose weed and murdering/arms dealing are equivalent in his eyes.
Reminds me of Airforce One, just with a different outcome.
Disgusting
So much for not negotiating with terrorists. Joe Biden is a weak pathetic presdient. Brittney Griner should be rotting in a Russian  prison cell
So Biden's gov traded Viktor Bout a "Lord of War" with an Anti-America Basket ball player ? It's very logical....😅
Worse trade ever 😂
Mr Bout was probably laughing at the end knowing he was free only becouse a black lesbian wnba player entered russia with weed
I don't have a problem with her release.  I have a problem with making her into some kinda hero. She broke the law over there and before she went there she didn't appreciate America.  So how can the people of America embrace that!!!
The Lord of War finally came home.
Makes me wanna puke watching this
I would have tod Vic, "you owe me one"
as far as im concerned Russia could have kept that troll
What a disgrace.  Our Pesident should be ashamed. Ecery politician that condoned this should be sent home in shame. Absolute failure
Lmfao 🤣 what and embarrassing moment
Now if they traded a war criminal for Brittney griner, image who they would trade for lebron, El Chapo?
Free Marc Fogel!!!!!!! He did the same thing but nobody is coming to help him
They cut out the part where she shook Viktors hand lol
Griner should be locked up in russian male jail.
Ahh hell nah.
Russia definitely struck gold with that one.
Shitd Russia wanted him back real bad
This is the reality where everything is not equal
Sad part of Britney doesn’t know the implications she has caused this trade. Doubt she knows who viktor is or cares.
Disgusting
yes please exchange an arms dealer for a gender confused mentally ill person, such a good trade, wow. Any stray you could have found from here to Russia would have been a better and more useful pick. Thats shameful
All that matters to the biden regime is skin color, "gender" fluidity, and sexual preferences.  We were starting to wake up to their tricks ,so they had to ramp up the racism. If anyone argues that this was incredibly stupid ,then they will be labeled homophobe, racist, misogynist. That should help flare the fires of racism back up. Cant have the poors open their eyes too wide and realizing that it dosent matter to 90% what color/sex/gender someone is, we all want the same things in life. The only ones that are oppressing anyone are the ones in charge. The government oppresses all of us. And keeps us fighting each other so we dont come together and evict the whole lot of them. And we could.
a very feminine walk by Brittney🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When i seen the arab in a white robe i thought britnwy griner waa getting married or something
Libtard making bad choice, what a surprize.
Funny how they took the handshake out
Russian guy w suit got fake Hands and his real ones are tucked inside holding a gun
Bout: “Looks like they exchange me for biiiig strong American warrior.”  in thick Russian accent.
It was a GREAT TRADE. If it pissed off the trumpers,then I LOVED IT!!!👍👍👍
Way to go Joe merchant for F,,,,ing death for her
Most dumbest trade by the u.s.  smh. !
That black person is a criminal.  She should’ve never been exchanged. We don’t want her back.   She claims to be a respected athlete. Sorry I don’t respect drug addicts.
Trading a murdering arms dealer for a dumb-ss dope smoking basketball player..A Biden move.
Wokeness at its finest.  What a joke of a country the U.S. has become.
Wonder if she loves America enough to stay and play for usa
The Russian dude gets hugs and smiles, meanwhile, the NBA "dude" doesn't even get a handshake 😅 it is funny how this scenario shows who is important and who is not 😆😂🤣
Most dumbest and disgraceful move by the US to not pick the serviceman who shouldve been picked. We gave them the smartest man and should show they actually care about their men and asked for our basketball player back.  I will never understand how far up our head is up our ..... but all i can say is you just opened pandoras box the serviceman would have been much more beneficial knowing things over someone who tried smuggling thc oil to another country. Wow
Nice swap, instead of bringing marines locked up in Russia they bring over some mentally ill trans.
I bet he was holding back the biggest laugh of the century lmao
The worst trade they could've have done
Lord of War traded for Lord of Woke
Bro this is literally the dude from the movie the lord of war and we are trading him for the only wnba player who can dunk
this is just like trading Walid Cheddira for Lionel Messi
He got the one wish every prisoner would have !!
Leave him he can change his life style please
For anyone who doesn’t know there is an American soldier who has been in jail for years in Russia and they decided to trade her instead of him go check it out this disgusts me
Dang! this warlord is released for a fvcking crackhead..
She just looked into the eyes of death himself
Our president is a vagina
and just like that we have forgotten
No way that is a woman.
Why in every video they cropped out the part where she shook HIS HANDS 😂😂😂😂😂
Why don’t you release aafia who is inocent and has been abused by the usa system and was kidnapped by the same People
Daft Americans lol 😂
Cant wait for the news to be showing that Viktor is probably gonna win the war for Russia against Ukraine somehow 😂
Locked up for 14 years because of lies. Yet the real merchants of death are walking free and live like kings..... ...and probably took frequent flights to Epsteins Island.
BREAKING NEWS!!!!!!!!! This just in. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are considering trading Tom Brady for a rookie member of the Cleveland Browns training squad.
So basically you got to be trans black and an athlete and you can get away with what other can't... mark vokle did the exact same thing as this bloke and he is serving 14 years while this bloke gets out...
Glad she’s home so she can complain about America some more
Didn't show the part we shook hands with a fool. SMH
The Russian government representatives hugged the weapons dealer... Who got the short end of the stick? 🤔
Nice little edit there lol Jesus Christ 🙄
It's a SHAME to release an arm dealer Victor Bout who is wanted worldwide in an exchange for Britney Griner. If Britney was not black and lesbian, she would be in Russian prison right now. Instead, a highly decorated American Marine is STILL in Russian prison because he is white and straight. WTF is wrong with our politicians!!
I'm actually happy. Victor bout was just a vehement supporter of the 2nd amendment.  The amount of dead US soldiers blood on his hands is deep.
"Bro... nick cage plays you in a movie."
in 1945 Germany offered Stalin to exchange a Russian-captured German (Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus) with Yakov Dzhugashvili (Lieutenant) Stalin said: Lieutenant will never be of the same value as Field Marshal, Yakov Dzhugashvili was Stalin's, Older Son.
Lmao she walks like zion 0:16
You people don’t even realize this dude was going to be free in 5 years. WAKE UP.
I hope he reads some of these comments.  LOSER POS DRUG ADDICT!!!
So glad we gave up someone responsible for the deaths of thousands to get back a legally detained domestic abuser.  20 people came to her homecoming
Worst trade of all time
It's a freaking comedy 🤣
Hey I got a shiny Nickel that's worth about ten trillion dollars too me, its not worth ten trillion dollars but it's really shiny, anyone looking to make a trade with me
Bruh… American be on some dumb ishhh.. I get it.. put yourself in their shoes.. but honestly this is so dumb af
I wonder if Griner will still kneel for the national anthem... If she does I hope there's someone up in Row Z with a carcano
Why was the handshake with Griner and Victor edited out??
*It is back home,now send old Joe in exchange for the marine!!🥴🤣
So does this mean we now have pot legal federally now or is it only the famous and popular people that can still smoke freely with zero harassment????
This is the worst possible timeline for the human race
Funny, Griner walks like Herman Munster.  Is there lead in her boots? I seriously thought she was the Russian for a moment.
I mean he’s still gonna be in jail though so
Viktor instantly starts talking to his comrades about where to source weapons
Bro Russia literally traded a pen for a 7 million dollar Beverly hills mansion💀
Sorry mf
In football terms Biden trade Ronaldo for Harry maguire
Bet she got a THC vape pen waiting for her. Them woke people don't ever learn.
Russian dude was probably like man I can't believe this sh*t and bites himself to see if it's real.
This is despicable
we're fucked
"What a worthy trade!" Said NO ONE EVER 🤦🏼‍♀️
It BAFFLES me that people call him a WAR Criminal...  What does that make US Gov always meddling in other countries affairs and selling weapons to the highest bidder?    Whats worse? One man?  Or a who SYSTEM (Military Industrial Complex).
Lol the USA is becoming all masochistic, like that one simp who is desperate for  attention from people that don't even care about them while ignoring people that actually love and care.
A military judge sitting as a special court martial convicted the appellant [Paul N. Whelan], consistent with his pleas, of attempted larceny, three specifications of dereliction of duty, making a false official statement, wrongfully using another's social security number, and ten specifications of making and uttering checks without having sufficient funds in his account for payment … He was sentenced to 60 days restriction, reduction to pay grade E-4, and a bad-conduct discharge.
And just when you thought this government couldn't get any dumber... They are really doing a great job imploding America.
People are still in jail in the USA for the same crime the USA felt necessary to trade an arm's dealer to enact justice. How does that work in a thinking society
Why is a Saudi there?
I hope she reads these comments and understands how most Americans feel for about her.
Take a knee Griner.   Nobody wants you back.
She just stood there like a total goof too. No confidence.
Can someone explain why prisoners exchange is done despite the fact that the person has criminal records? From what I know the girl did some marijuana which is illegal on the country and an athlete and on the other side the dude was a arm smuggler also a big one from the 90’s...and I don’t see why they are greeting his return with a handshake like he’s some hero
Biggest scam😂
BLACK PRIVILEGE
JOE FKIN CRAZY BIDEN! 😠😠😠😠😠😠
A real hero.... Then there's Brittney griner
looks like they cut out the his and hers handshake
This is just absolute joke
seems like more of that endless black privilege - she was picked over a white guy
Viktor chillin'
Russia won this one.
Sickening
Putin waiting on him to have laughing party.
Video cuts right before, which looks like a hand shake between the two 🤔
Shame how many more are still in there 1 arms dealer is worth 1 Basketball player while those with no money stay ..1 death dealer 20 American's.sad
Law. Marriage is Between a man and a woman 👠 but it doesn't mean we hate Homosexuals. We pray for them just as we do all sinners because hell is real, God world is real, and Jesus Christ is alive. We love you Brittany G but we won't worship nor condoms what you did or do. Amen 🙏
That’s not a girl……I’m not buying it for one second!!!😂😂😂
Worst trade in WNBA history.
This is messed up. That shetty freak is probably smoking her vape and drinking wine now Laughing. The Russian guy now is drinking his vodka while closing a deal to supply bombs to destroy schools and hospitals.
Look at the guards fake hand
Let her rot in the Russian prison.  We have an American vet in Russian prison but he's not black or gay enough to save? Sickening
Clickbait, Brittany wasn't there. Just a bunch of guys
Nice job Americans. You became the lowest of the low. Not just with this delinquents but since o$(b)ma
Thus is insane!  Though I’m so happy forBG and her family
We traded an arms dealer for a drug dealer.  Yeah America definitely got a raw deal
US wants to reduce gun violence by releasing an arms dealer? Aren't those guns going to be sold to the US?
You mean Bob Griner….
WHO WAS The  Arab man at the talking to Brittany at the end of the video.
Communists
It’s like Homeland.
why did you edit the part out where she shakes hands with deathman?
AND YOU ALL VOTED FOR JOE BIDEN 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 REMEMBER HE FELL OFF HIS BIKE RIGHT AFTER COMING TO A COMPLETE STOP🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  I AM DEFINITELY ABOUT TO TRY TO EXCHANGE MY IPHONE 6s FOR THE NEW 14 PRO🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
In WW2, Stalin refused to trade his own son, who had been captured by the Germans, for the Marshal Paulus. He said: "I will not trade a marshal for a lieutenant". Now the US are trading an arms dealer for a basketball player who broke the laws of another country. The Russians must be rolling on the floor laughing. Sad that such a man is free, but that's also a nice payback considering all the political prisoners the US had jailed to force other countries to do as they want.
Viktor Bout must be thinking "thank you for your stupidity,hahahaha"
Welcome home Viktor 🇷🇺
Way to go Clown Biden.. !!! Way to go
Hahahahah merchant of death swap with lesbian?? AMERIKAAN SUCH A JOKE
WOW LIKE THAT BOTH MEN FREE!!! LAME EXCHANGE AMERICA!!! BRING BACK OUR SOLDER WTF!!! HE/SHE TOOKS DRUGS IN TRASH!!!
If Mr. Victor was so dangerous, he would not have been traded for a tattooed drug addict, but for an American marine. But that's what Joe Biden's sick administration cares about. Shame 👎
We got a basic WNBA player and we gave them Makarov! CPT Price is very upset lol
That was a fucked up trade... A vape pen related crime vs "merchant of death"??
We're in trouble now ..they just got someone that can risk thousands of life's again and we got a wnba player
I’m happy for Brittany but exchange with arms dealer Viktor??? I wonder about morons who make such decisions.
It seems fair to me and an equal swap of quality = World wide illegal military grade arms dealer, with lots of secrets of no doubt high end well known people buying these weapons to start clandestine wars for a silly anti American drug user, who plays a game that no one seems to care about!  Well done Biden you knob, absolute plank decision that matey!  Anyone would think you, are a dog that follows the orders of your masters in Russia!  Just saying................................
Vic was never suppose to be locked up that long as well, he wasn't a terrorist he was a businessman
Wonder if Bout was mad, I am only worth a basketball player?
Bro I didn’t even know the WNBA existed
Russian arms dealer : bad criminal Brittany griner: bad athlete  Damn, I guess it's a fair trade...
did they shake hands?
RUSSSIA IS SHOWING HIS VOICE SINCE HIS HORMONE BLOCKERS WORE OFF !!!!!!!!!
That's a big a$$ b.. chick!
why the hell wasnt Paul traded for FIRST since hes been there for longer ????? ffs
Should have let her/Him serve time..
What a Time to be Alive
Peak Democrat incompetence
All of that hardwork by the DEA for nothing. Pfft. Disappointing …
Wtf why did they kiss though?
Glad she is home. Hope Paul gets home soon 🙏
Man I wish we could hear what he was saying “wtf is a vape pen?”
Shawty look like a man fr
liberal america is crazy lmaoooo
This show how useless our governments are.
She looks like a Big Tall skinny man and walks like one too. Smh
I like how they cut the part where Griner shakes Bouts hand they know everyone would freak out 3x worse 😅
The dumbest move in history of the world to  swap a crack head for arms dealer what a joke.Why not leave the crack head to rot in jail she is not above the law.
Yall edited this. Why cut it? what happened that you cut it?
Why is Brittany and Victor's interaction aways edited out?
Did they just traded the literal real life counterpart of Vladimir Makarov for a basketball player?
Gay did brinty spiral in Wu Han cia noice all over .
The only explanation for this hilariously asymmetrical trade is that Biden had Brittney Griner on his Fantasy Basketball team. Friggin' cheater!!
Did she shake hands with the other prisoner? Was that cut from the clip??
Looks real. 😂😂
To think they would change her with real life Makarov, she must've been one hell of an basketball player
Why was the video edited?
Russia- “I’ll trade you my 4 bucks for your 5!” America- “Done deal!”
What a sh1t exchange . US citizens spent million $ and years to jail Viktor , and now it's released for somebody who doesn't even respect USA. Congratz to Viktor and Russians for the best prison exchange in the history
The DEA has spent so much time trying to capture Viktor Bout that it was easy to trade him for a black, gay female basketball player by the FJB administration.  My message to the DEA is, "YOU ALL HAVE BEEN SCREWED" by FJB.  You all are now a laughing stock to the world.
Brittney should have stayed in a Russian prison.
And someone just leaves weapons worth billions of dollars to a terrorist country... How many American generals and senators are already sitting in American prisons?
An arms dealer for a woke pothead.  Seems fair.
Why america is so stupid? Can anyone tell me why?
Looking like a walking stick! No wonder Russia didn't want to keep that ugly mug.
Why is the video edited?
A clip was cut off.
What a stupid trade.  Insane!!!
Its like trading a honda with a whole tank
Prisoner swap..... It's not a bad trade two people who hate America
President Ford (Air Force One) would have never made that deal.
I like poutine
did she shake his hand
USA should've left that dope smoking non-American loving beotch in f*cking Russia. Bring our American Marine home.  President Trump would have NEVER agreed to that bull-sh*t!!!
Did Griner shake hands with Bout?
Griner shook hands with the Merchant of Death!! They cut it out of the video but you can see her step towards him when it was her turn!!!
We release a very dangerous person in exchange for someone who got caught with marijuana, meanwhile we continue to imprison THOUSANDS of American citizens for using marijuana
You know this was rigged lol wow over a vape? Who's set this up? Wouldn't doubt if Dennis Rodman had something to do with this 😂
Media cut out Britney and Victor shake hands. Why?
Dumb americans
Disgusting and embarrassing on the Americans behalf
I really hope he gets back into arms dealing.  Let the world see what a stupid trade this was.  Plus the movie sequel is just the thing Nicolas Cage needs right now.
I recently saw a clip of this show in Russia talking about this trade. Russia is basically laughing at us for this. Even they can't fathom how trading an arms dealer for a basketball player is a fair trade.
Let these broads get that thang beat in.. can’t be shaming these fleabags.. don’t waste ya time trying to convince these social media women otherwise. That’s long been out the window since the s l u t walk.
Why did they cut the moment Britney shook hands with Victor? Censored everywhere
The taxpayers get a break and Vik gets to go to Russia, things may not be as good as he thinks. The Russians are not know to treat non Russians very well. Yup he is not Russian folks.
This time the trading media got hot news. Russia is going to meet its own arms dealer. Biden can use this incident to publicize it to win votes for himself. The only loser this time is the judicial system in the United States. Facts have proved that: Biden's political career is above the judicial system! This is very American democracy!
Viktor is winning big
Americaaa is so weak
Who needs reality t.v nowadays smh.. watching this exchange, felt like something outta a movie..
What exactly did the WP edit out of this video.
To everyone who is upset about the trade think about it! 🤔 if it was u
Does anybody have a link to the unedited video where both of them shake hands ??  In a million years these two probably never thought their paths would cross
Conveniently edited so we cant see Griner reach out and try to shake an arms dealer's hand. Media loves their narratives.
SO DID YOU GET SOME INSIDE CONNECTIONS..  BOUT: OFCOURSE IT WAS TOO EASY WE CAN NUKE AMERICA ANYTIME
.14 editing wow the two bout & griner must have shaken hands
He looks debriefed and ready to do what we told him to do.
0:15 Conservatives cut out the part where victor and griner shaked hands.  🤔🙄
I thankful Mrs. Griner is home.  Now, on to Mr. Whelan and others.
Putin was playing Chess the entire time while US was playing Uno.
Gotta love it when Democrats push for stricter gun control then they release the "the merchant of death" who was one of the world's largest gun dealers and terrorists...... for her. Our country is a complete mess and ruined because of the Democratic Party. Btw, that doesn't even look like them.
why they cut out the handshake between Brittney and Viktor
Mr.Victor thank you for allowing Putin to set you up. I told him it will not work. I was wrong. Please visit Russia again.
So, you telling me that the Biden  Govt trade a leftist drug user for the release of the "Merchant of Death" in a time where we still have Russian invasion of Ukraine going?  Lmao
why was the viktor/britney hand shake cut out of the video?
wow Brittnet=y is a MALE!!!! AT AIRPORT EXCHANGE !!!!!!!  TRUTH FINALLY
Common, unknown citizens wouldn't even make the news let alone a high profile, ridiculous exchange.
Why is this video edited. Either that or grinner is also able to teleport when she approaches to shake hands. Or perhaps she did shake hands and they don't want to show it🤔😄😄😄
brittanys the biggest guy there
Did she shake his hand?
We all gonna act like we didn’t see her finna shake that man’s hand!?!?
They keep cutting the video when she shakes Viktor Bouts hand what the hell. WHY ARE THEY CENSORING THIS!
How many people will literally die because of this? Joe Biden, that blood will be in your hands.
Nicholas Cage rubbin his hands together for a sequel 👏
but yet Trump let 5000 Taliban go for nothing you stupid Buffoons are hilarious
Damn this like a old school steam scam
She should have just stayed there since she hates America so bad or we should've swapped Lebron James and Fauci for her
We broke the #1 rule of the marines. No man left behind. Even if he is not a spy, he is a marine. We left a marine behind to save a basketball player that broke the law in Russia. Our intelligence community moral must be on the floor.
I hope when she starts traveling again she doesn't take her  drugs into that country and starts this s*** all over again remember traveling leave your drugs at home
I think ya cut out a bit there. It appears Grinder was going to shake Viktors hand. Hmm...
BIG MISTAKE THAT ARMS DEALER WAS A GOOD LEVERAGE. NOW HE WILL CONTINUE IS "WORK" AS A MERCHANT OF DEATH
The darkie chick is thinking--I was fingered by Russians, Oh, when can we meet again.
She doesn’t even like America!
I NEVER wanna hear crap about gun control from the left again!!!
Starting to see How laughable our country is now
Even Bout feels let down by this deal...
A pot head is not a high value asset, worst trade ever. Thank goodness we are not at war yet cause if this is how we play the game we are gonna loose.
Dumbass liberals better not complain about gun control ever again, just stfu about it!
As a Canadian looking in.. This is shamefull.
Only a fool would join the US Military", Democrat politicians prioritize anti-American athletes; over military vets.
Swapped her pot smoking dumbass for a state sponsored arms dealer responsible for the deaths of thousands of people all over the world and let Russia call the shots all the way through.  This is how we prove to the rest of the world that we are a selfish POS society that cares only about themselves. Good job Joe!
What a way to get in prison w/marijuana so stupid and dumb.
I love how they cut out the part where Brittany reaches to shake his hand too.  She has no clue  what was happening or who he is and that would have been spun into some crazy narrative.  He on the other hand knew exactly who she was and what was going on.
Why is everyone only showing the edited version?
Imagine when he finally came home, ate, took a shower, and is laying in bed. What's going through his mind?
What does it take to impeach this worthless president?
I bet the American suits felt real safe with Brittney there as backup.
CLEARLY THEY CUT OUT THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE EVIL WHITE MAN AND THE POOR BLACK WOMEN FOR SOME REASON .. I WANT TO SEE WHY .. WHERE CAN I SEE THAT CLIP UNEDITED
Merchant of Death whispering to the Brittney the Marxist: "You've been a very good communist - keep it up."
So we are trading Brittany with a dangerous criminal who is called the merchant of death who is responsible for the death of thousands What a great win 😅
They got the lord of war…secret agent…kgb…deal arms and ammunition in metric tons…we got a lesbian black basketball player
Why’d they cut the video when the two exchange words
Biden's Blue hat special in time for Christmas! "MRGA"
“For those of you thinking the US is in charge, think again. We just traded a basketball player who hates her country for one of the deadliest arms dealer in the world and abandoned a US Marine in Russia. Anyone with a half a brain knows that was not a fair trade.” SR
Why does the vidio skip in the middle of the exchange???
Anyone else notice how the Russians conveniently cut the video at the very moment Griner started to reach out her hand to shake Bout's hand? Don't want to make the black, gay, tattooed, female American look gracious, now do we? Also don't want the world to see Bout being prevented from returning the hand shake. That would make the Russians look NOT gracious. For what it's worth, Bout said he told Griner, "Good luck."
One of the worst prison trades in modern history. This is the equivalent of trading a $1 post card for the authentic Mona Lisa.
Did she and the arms dealer shake hands?
Why did they edit the hug out?
fake news. why did you edit their handshake?
Why are all these videos cropped.
They cut the part of him shaking Brittany's hand.
swap between a 'recreational drug user professional basketball player and 'one of the world's most notorious transnational arms trafficking kingpins'...
Russia 1, US 0.
You think you or I would have been traded for the merchant of death over weed charges in Russia?? Fukk the Biden administration.
This was a hell of a deal for the U.S.   Now we can hurry up and get her back to protesting the national anthem during sporting events again🤦‍♂️
And, of course, we know for an absolute fact from credible sources like FOX News, News Max, and the estate of Rush Limbaugh, that U.S. officials never once interrogated Bout, never pressured him for any Soviet secrets, never seized any of his assets, and never planted a trace on him once he was released. In fact, he was given a going away party complete with caviar and the finest champagne, and Christmas cards were exchanged. Meanwhile, the Russians got tons of military secrets from Greiner, including defense strategies, and voting booth access to help the evil Joe Biden and Kamala Harris defeat the kind and benevolent Donald Trump in the next election.
Why is there a Royal talking to her?
One happy Russian who wants us dead... One gay basketball player who hates America.
Man that American guy is tall..Russians are laughing right now at USA
We have 2 much this ain’t a fair exchange this a robbery.
Damn, why did they cut out the part where it looked like they shook hands?
That’s a war criminal walking free just like that 😂😂
She reached out to shake his hand and he just looked at it and continued to walk away shaking his head then laughing about it with the other guys 🤣😂🤣😂
Really hope something bad happens to this administration. Really bad. They are demons. The enemy of America.
I guess governments can do whatever they want with their property.
We gotta get Mike Tyson 😤 and Britteny Griner on his show Hotboxin to talk about it and blaze-up one up💨....lol
Merchant of Death is reserved for Dick Cheany
LMAO THEY EDITED THE PART WHERE SHE SHAKES HIS HAND
0:16....Britteny Griner and the Merchant Of Death...hug it out and shake hands. 🤝
Where was this?
I hope the Russian gets assassinated if he returns to arms trafficking.
Interesting how they edited out Griner shaking Bout's hand.  Watch her step toward Bout and the film is clipped to after the handshake.
Why did you they purposely edit out Brittany Grenier shaking his hand? 🤔 🧐
He better stand for the anthem next time.  The country he hates just exchanged a murderer to bring him home.
He said it best. Traded a elephant for a fly. Good job America. This woman (man) was against the National Anthem of this country and was traded for a Russians Arm Dealer during a war in the Ukrain. 1000s more will die because of this trade. I hope every Ukrainian death Brittany Griner feels every one!!! And we left a Marine over there that fought for this country. SHAMEFUL
How is the Arabian guy ????
Why they cut him shaking her hand?
This guy literally thought he was selling rockets to FARC rebels in Colombia, and the undercover agents told him these rockets would be used to shoot down United States military helicopters near Colombia, and Bout didn’t care.. that’s who we traded for a NBA player..........
One is a horrible Human being the other is a Russian guy.
Fun Fact:  There was no vape pen.
"РОССИЯ - САМАЯ ПАСКУДНАЯ, ДО БЛЕВОТИНЫ МЕРЗКАЯ СТРАНА ВО ВСЕЙ МИРОВОЙ ИСТОРИИ. МЕТОДОМ СЕЛЕКЦИИ ТАМ ВЫВЕЛИ ЧУДОВИЩНЫХ МОРАЛЬНЫХ УРОДОВ У КОТОРЫХ САМО ПОНЯТИЕ ДОБРА И ЗЛА ВЫВЕРНУТО НА ИЗНАНКУ, ВСЮ СВОЮ ИСТОРИЮ ЭТА НАЦИЯ БАРАХТАЕТСЯ В ДЕРЬМЕ И ПРИ ЭТОМ ЖЕЛАЕТ ПОТОПИТЬ В НЕМ ВЕСЬ МИР." ( И. ИЛЬИН )
china joe showed his true colors by exchanging a ruthless murderer for dumbass basketball player who smuggled hash oil into Russia...this move will comehome to haunt the demonrats
Nice trade US. You just started WW3 .
most incredible moment i've seen this year.  Britney is like what when she see vitkor but.
Of course he's a lesbian
Airport of spies?
Why have they edited out the moment that Griner and Bout shake hands?
Victor Bout stated that Brittany Griner wanted to shake his hand. Did she? Why was the hand shake edited out?  Did Brittany's decency not jive with usa press ? Elon show us the truth
Thanking media and politicians?  The public pressure got her out.  You’re welcome
Americans should have insisted that every black man in prison in America convicted of non-violent pot offenses be released FIRST
He can’t be that dangerous if he has prison term that in 2029 so I call it win for American . Brittany was just starting her time
Why was the part where Greiner shook hands with the Russian dealer taken out 🤔🤔🤔
Is that Bin Salman over there? What exactly is his interest in this trade? Oh yeah... The arms dealer
Who are the suits and sheets on the left?
I hope now we hear nothing further regarding gun control in the US.  If you can let this guy out, apparently you're not worried at all about access to weapons.
Pay attention to who made it all happen saudi Arabi, the real rulers in the world.
Black lesbian vs a veteran.    Russia laughs at us. FJB and send the trash back in the brig, she didn’t want to be here.
This dude is a tough nut to crack.
Amazing deals Joe Biden, amazing deals
The edited Viktor and Brittney’s handshake out, lol! The media in the west is laughable at best!
Victor must immediately meet and greet his old buyers and restart supplying arms and ammunition. Such a noble profession. The lesbian transmission tower may go back to being nothing at all.
Say what you will about Trump, but he would NEVER have made this trade.
Russia got a super team now.
Every person in this video is useless
This shows how pathetic biden admin is
A sad day in America 🇺🇸😞!!!!
Smh
Ask yourself why can't the original footage of them shaking hands seems to be cut from every video clip...when it was live they shook hands...as if she was working with the Russians to get this guy back...what better time to be released then the winter of the war against Ukraine...bet those drones start dropping now
imagine swapping stewpid bugaboo for weapon dealer
Ну, американцы, вы, конечно, лохонулись с этим обменом 🤦‍♂️
The prisoners shook hands right. They edit that out
Can I please trade in my “privilege” for the “oppression” poor old Britney has?
0:16 WP edited out Brittney and Viktor handshake, I've seen full video.
In exchange war criminal for a baseball is totally mismanagement and a joke decision - something is very wrong
For the US the life of it's people's especially white ones is important, others countries citizen is nothing
I support this. America must be destroyed sooner.
Agent valentine must be fuming 🤣
I’ve never been so disappointed in my country before they don’t care about the ppl only the ppl with money
cool ... welcome back
Worst trade in human history lmao i bet Russians are laughing at the US right now, what a joke 😂
OMG! We Americans do not want this man acting like a woman. Tell this traitor, Brittney, we do not want IT. Did I use the correct pronoun?
Wow! That’s something rarely seen.  A prisoner exchange between the most powerful countries in the world.  👩🏽‍🦱🇺🇸
Now Victor Bout said on his latest interview that he support the Ukraine Invasion and willing to use his skills and volunteer to help Russia 😆😆😆
I certainly dont agree with the western LGBTQ,et,etc,etc agenda and i would also acknowledge this trade was like swapping a JB for DT, lol However, Most of you bigots wouldn't have a thing to say if she was a white lesbian woman. So why the double standard? Ahh I forget typical yte behavior
Notice her hand shake with TMD was cut out
The trade is not about the gravity of the crime. It’s about exchanging one citizen for another.
Nice editing. She(?) shook the Merchant of Death's hand.
Smfh.
what is this?
Excuse me news people....I have questions!
That's a dude
Example of what separates real man and a wannabe! Pathetic!
Either she knew she was wrong from the begging and thought she could get away with it, or acted out of ignorance by not properly informing herself of a foreign country's laws, which are equally bad and could've been prevented. Either way, she deserved what happened to her because of her own stupidity.  If Russia wouldn't accept to trade anyone else (like a Marine who actually deserves freedom for serving his country) then the US should've let them keep her until she completes her sentence.  This is identity politics at it's finest.
God bless Russia! 🇷🇺  God damn Griner and the US.
If Trump didn't let Paul Whelans trade chip walk, this whole discussion wouldn't be taking place. I went with LGBT/race because they could get someone, she was the one chosen, because perhaps Russia thinks The Spy might still talk. He may be talking for we know. They could get someone out THAT DAY, they took her. Too bad if you think it was a bad deal. They have other Russians they can deal to get him out. instead of crying about her, cry about why they won't trade off more people to get him out. They have one held in Germany they can use to trade for him.
Bruh
Most despicable thing in uncle creepys presidency. Guy involved in millions of deaths in Africa is traded for 1 African American.
The Russians won. Griner didn't do anything wrong but Viktor is the price. The Russians are happy to have him back. Griner was just an unlucky pawn in this game
All this just to boost WNBA ratings? Still ain't nobody gonna watch! 😂
Well I guess the DeAndre Hopkins for David Johnson trade doesn’t seem that bad compared to this. Joe Biden you got Bill O’Brien off the hook as worst GM ever. 😂
When they lock you up in Washington DC or Virginia to do testing on you. Lol Russia.
...Who?
These are the terrible decision that diversity leads too.
Guess she’ll be more careful WHICH COUNTRY she travels to now with her drugs.
Wow.  Can you even IMAGINE how our Marine Paul Whelan is feeling right now???  She ( if she really is a she) should have to go look him in the eye and shake HIS hand.
What a stain on our history and especially this administration. I can easily see this guy in headlines again after committing more heinous crimes. Oopsie
The most popular trade in WNBA history
Oh, this is where they exchanged a high risk for America for a drug attic !!! Okay……
From this day forth, I do not EVER  want to hear another damn democrat calling for gun control ever again.   Ever.
Biggest mistake in US history
Lol, you all acted like kids crying for her to be returned and now ya are not happy !?!?!  I do understand the US traded a warlord for a 4th rate athlete, but she checks all the boxes for what is considered the perfect human !!! She is Gay Women of color, the perfect model for all woke media peeps to grasp at 🤣  If this was a movie script, it would be refused 😂😂
There’s worse people in the USA so who cares
Too bad we got no one of importance back. Just some basketball player.
He looks pretty damn healthy to me
What about the regular Americans in Russian an Iranian prisons. The Only reason why this person got out is because she's a gay basketball  player.
Can’t find the video of her shaking viktors hand.
Shaking hands with a Shiek?  She would be dead in Saudi Arabia. No mercy there. If you smell a rat it's because there is a rat involved.
Why am I seeing this garbage?
total bull shtttttttt
Another blunder for those in US leadership! Oh yippee. Nothing new
America saves her life and she will still claim america is racist.
Stupid f-ing US traitor government
The “Internationale” should be playing in the background
Nice edit of the infamous hand shake between grinner and the human killer! Disgusting!
EXECUTE THE TRAITOR THAT MADE THIS HAPPEN
SHOULD HAVE LEFT HER THERE TO PAY FOR HER CRIME. STUPID DECISIONS DESERVE PROPER PUNISHMENT, BUT NOOOO, SHE IS "SPECIAL" ANYONE ELSE HERE IN AMERICA WOULD STILL BE DOING TIME  THIS IS BULLSHlT
You sure cause that look like Anthony Davis 😂
Russia:  “So the U.S. didn’t want the Marine cause he’s WHITE, STRAIGHT, and bonafide MALE” 🤣🤣🤣
Nothing like trading a POS tranny for a POS WAR CRIMINAL... this Administration needs to be executed...
The Russians like, those Americans love their athletes but to hell with the soldiers who fight for them
Why Saudi there ?
Corrupt news as usual...where's the handshakes.??? Shame ..between detainees ????? ...
So skin color does matter? (And who you voted for?)
What a raw deal a pot head for the merchant of death ! Brandon strikes again .
Can we exchange Joe Biden for a loyal American?
an arms dealer, for a gawky fame ho. Nice job guys
This is INSANE! some basketball player who committed a crime gets swapped for a dangerous arms dealer?! Who know what that person will do now, and I bet you that if she was't a basketball player she would still be in prison no problem.
Damn Russians
Hey, she's black, a woman(?), and a traitor. It's a triple win for "Buyden".
Victor bout was a puppet in a larger scheme. A scape goat for the actual criminals that roll the real power. If you think the US isn't watching this guy like a f@#$ing hawk then you got another thing coming. There's nowhere bout can hide.
This is the start of the 2nd Cold War
Show us the uncut version
Freedom! We only value it, when it is lost. As usual, the Far right can't recognized President Biden doing anything right. Paul Whelan''  uncle was very candid about his uncle not being released.
Russia is way smarter than us….that’s why they got rid of this goofy drug addict. They were like you can have it back. Lmao. How stupid can you be to take any drugs into Russia.
A Russian man for an American man.
of course potato biden leaves a marine to rot in russia while getting out some jogger what an absolute sham
This is the worst trade of all time
Basketball player can come back smoking that weed she desperately loves while a former decorated Marine who is old and weak will continue suffer and most likely never make it back to the soil he was born, raised, and dedicate to protect with his life
No gunfire?
Why was there a jump cut when it looked like she was about to shake his hand?
We have had people in the US imprisoned for decades due to Marijuana charges and we just traded an international war criminal for someone we do the same thing to here? WTF?? How?
All the media showed was the "edited" version but whomever was FORCED to edit it intentionally left one from in that shows Griner's lean into the handshake.   I want to give props to that editor who all wanted us to see what he/she was ORDERED to cut out.
I've never been so embarrassed to be an American. Shameful.
Well thank Jesus that Barabbus is back home safe.
Well played Russia,you made our crappy leftover Obama administration look weak
Russia smoked us on that one.  They set it from the start.  LOL
Top 10 worst trades
Not a good trade. Russian won.
What a disgrace! The world is laughing at us, an Unknown WNBA star for The Merchant of DEATH, what a clown world
Couldn’t tell which one was her first glance
Should have sent a drone in, two for one…
This is some suspicious sht... Best way to hide it is plain sight.
Still want Biden as your president?
So sad that we allow our laws and institutions to be corrupted by these governments. Why trade a mental case with a drug issue for a war criminal
The Biden administration just lost their narrative for gun control.
Think I’m going to trade in my GLA250 for a Maybach AMG. Its only fitting
A dope smoking basketball player for a "Merchant of Death" Russian arms dealer.  You cannot make this stuff up.
I don't understand
Is it worth it swapping a pothead for a war criminal? I thought Americans are smarter than this.
“ IT WORKED BOYS THEY REALLY GAVE HIM BACK “ 😂😂😂😂😂
Unbelievable?! A D-List BBall player for a guy who's still capable of killing large ethnic groups while our empty-headed POTUS is losing a regime war.
How disgusting and stupid A person good at bouncing a ball for a hardcore criminal. What in the world
This is like giving up a Ferrari for a bicycle
The Lord of War for a pot smoking basketball player....the Dumacrats strike again....🤦‍♂️
Brittney Grimer is a man. Tests will prove it. Check out that Adams apple. Facts people.
Can't believe we traded for a tidley wink?
You idiotic liberals better never ever talk about gun control ever again. Trade a useless dope head, for a well-connected arms dealer to a country that's at war with an ally and is losing that war. You're all very much a bunch of freaking morons. It doesn't mean I wouldn't do business with the arms dealer at all he's willing to sell to everyone I'm small purchase but I'd still do business with him.
Well, might as well trade in my civic for an nsx now
In the Bible said that we will see worse thing.
Society is ruled and run by a ring of crime syndicates masquerading as governments who use their offices to legalize crime and fraud for themselves
What's with the Arab?
Didnt biden say he wouldnt negotiate, especially for an arms dealer🤔
Why the f’n heck a stupid basketball player is equal to an arms dealer I will never understand. This was the dumbest exchange in history.
This is so wrong😡
Arms trader probably be thinking; A: Someone's a better deal broker than me and I gotta get to learning. B: Man... is that all I'm worth? Thought It would be at least several high profile individuals. Not some nobody citizen...
It's disgusting  that we take a drug addicted  over a marine that serve his country
What a lop sided trade ever
This is like something out of a movie
She walks like a man 👨
Demócratas por obtener un voto le venden el alma diablo
Griner was born a dude with a penis.
This gov is a joke
Disgusting.  We traded an America hating arms dealer for an America hating social activist.  People will die because for this but hey at least we brought a traitor home.  This is just like Obama with Bo Burgdal but at least we could say Burgdal was an American soldier.  If you support this you're too stupid to have your opinions valued.
The merchant of death and the merchant of dikes 🙄
Horrible deal
I wonder if shittney will still kneel for the national anthem now that it’s “home “
The Marine didn’t smuggle in drugs. He’s guilty of being too white and too heterosexual.
My question is will she stand for the national anthem now?
He couldn't believe his luck! He must crown as the LUCKIEST MAN IN THE WORLD!
😡
Russia=параша🤣путин=хуйло🤣🤣кацапы=рабы задроченные🤣🤣🤣
He spent more than 10 years in jail for doing the same as Biden: sending arms to a country in war. When will Biden enter his own cell in prison?
Even walks like a man
Why they didn't show Griner shaking hands with Russian  Bout
a new low for the usa
THANKS FOR NOTHING BIDEN..... SFMF... WHEN WE GONNA TRADE HUNTER?
I'm sure Russia has enough gross rainbow flag losers as prisoners from the Ukraine anyway
What an incredible embarrassment! This administration doesn’t understand anything in regard to foreign policy!!!
shouldn't have never hapoened
i cant wait to see her tweet about how evil and racist america is.
Why did they cut their handshake?
Brittany was another racist when it happened
Sickening display
Good for her and the marine's father also agrees but a lot of military volunteers don't...  You volunteered and you didn't free anyone... You're not a World War II vet
Too bad the Marine isn't gay and black.
That's fucked up...should have kept here there!
It’s a lot of hand shakes going on‼️‼️‼️
They traded 2 chains for a War criminal. So sad
Very good!
Worst exchange EVER
Just rewatched the video and what a fake videos
You should have let me go back to my country instead of taking others who want to do harm in the world. This has to be a FKN joke
Worst trade ever
She/ he went to Russia with drugs on February 17, next day when entire world was freaking out about Russian invasion planned  on February 16.....  Think about it ...what a sane American will go to Russia during the war with drugs , knowing you will be arrested for it, unless  .....that was the original plan from the  white house to send....a transgender black lesbian for an exchange of a high profile weapon dealer right in Time when Russia is running of their weapons.....  Let's see if putin gets more weapons soon while America is withholding weapons from Ukraine.   Odd coincidence and timing
Outraged is even remotely describe how embarrassing this is. How sad that most people on here laugh about this situation. Image the race the merchant of death has had these last 12 years. We traded un patriotic American, while letting a mad man out with the resources to get back to work. WHOMEVER did this deal in America, should be tried for treason.
Ya. This was a fair trade.
Arms dealer for a drug addict lesbian basketball player... 👍
I wait for how much weaker America will become .  The humanitarian heart of this country has become politically bankrupt !
I don't want to here one more Democrat whine about gun control after this trade.
Biden traded a war criminal for a lesbian anti American talentless clown. Let that sink in.
FJB
Did you hear his voice,?
screw athletes. apparently some useless trash who can throw a ball around is worth one of the worlds biggest war criminals.
The Russian probably thought he was getting traded for someone important. Boy was he wrong! 💁🏼
Viktor Bout it's the Cheeky Alpha Elephant💪. Brittney Griner this is a weak drug addict🤢🤮
USA took the L.... Literally
This is disgusting. all the people locked up in the US for cannabis and Biden trades The merchant of death for this.
US Marine Paul Whelan should of been freed instead of that US hating Griner. She profits from the freedom she enjoys, bad mouths it then cries when she loses freedom when she stupidly violated the law.
How come griner looks Like a dude with short hair I thought she had long hair.
Russia has now offered to release Paul Whelan to Germany in a trade with them. He will be freed sooner than later, the U.S. had no other choice either leave both Whelan and Griner in a Russian prison indefinitely or get one out and keep the pressure up to get the other out. The nayayers are hilarious to listen to though as if they have a clue how international machinations work.
Why worry about an arms dealer, when Brandon give them  away in Afghanistan for free?
They cut off the handshake between Bout and Griner, this is just a business transactions - so sad this is the world we live in.
Murica
The Russians will probably mail her free airline tickets to Moscow and tell him, he left something in the hotel room.
Yeah the Biden regime in its entirety needs to be removed they traded a guy pretending to be a girl for an international gun Runner that's been held in our prison WOW , JUST WOW
What a moral outrage. Trading anti Americans is not a trade.
Trading your bottle of Cristal 🍾 for a Kirkland water botte🚰
Should of let carpet licker rot
Brittany is definitely a dude
Joe Biden was purely dumb on this one.
What happened? Why was Whalen not in the swap?  With Biden administration,  I guess, one has to be Afro American and gay to stand out…….wow, so that is how it is now.  Good to know, Mr. President, ignore the man you left behind, who actually fought for this country.  Way to go Mr President!
Just two biological males walking past each other...what's the big deal??
Veteran Paul Whelan remains in a Russian prison while a self confessed black lesbian convicted drug addict gets its freedom. Biden probably doesn't even know what the hell he just did. I guess getting a white person freed doesn't help Bidens agenda. Talk about discrimination in the NUT house in DC.
sad day in america.  completely pathetic
I need to figure out Russias trade secrets on this one so I swap places if I go to prison
Definitely an ugly trade!🤢🤮💯👍
Russian diplomats: Stupid Americans 🤣 give girl who play basketball for man who sell guns
She shouldnt be allowed back into the country.
Who are they? I've never heard of them. Is this from a video game, or is one of them a replacement for our farcical president?
Should have let her rot. Can't believe they picked that trash over military
IN AMERICA? MONEY TALKS... THEY TRADED A GAY BASKETBALL PLAYER FOR A WAR MONSTER? LEFT A MARINE THERE TO ROT? WHERE IS DEMACROCY?
I better not any more talk of gun control from these idiots Demoncrats.
She is the embodiment of the powerful American woman 🙏👑
It sure is hypocritical of Biden's administration who are anti-gun violence to do a prisoner swap for one of the most dangerous man on earth that was a weapons dealer!
The only WNBA trade that’s made headlines
"What a steal!!" –Russia after the deal.
Just like the movie he always got away
Viktor Butt said he WOULD go to war..."would".
Shake hands was cut video skip omg!
Swapping a notorious gun runner for a sports person who by the way got themselves in to that position shows once again Joe Biden is a moron. By the way Joe, you can only put one bullet in a cartridge.
Well it makes perfect sense that they brought her home. Why would they bring home the marine? He loves and fights for America, and is a known trump supporter. The Biden administration and their supporters hate that. Griner had all the qualities the Biden administration admires. She's black, she's queer, and she hates America.
The Russians are laughing 😂. They can’t believe how bad of negotiators the Biden administration is
Well make sure this guy sells a nuke to another that will use it on your country.   And you make sure to take this chick without a brain and keep her throwing balls through a ring in the air.  Wtf
Tremendous.
Arms dealer for a vape…hoo boy. Whose hand is she shaking wearing the thawb? Did he play a significant brokered the deal??
Should have left it there and brought home a marine!!! send it back and trade for something worth while a marine!!
🤔⬆️🌍🥰🛑🕤🇺🇸👨📱😳🏃‍♂️🥗💭🔥❤️💀🙏🏾🚇☕️👂📖🤷‍♂️☮️🍉
Ey Washington post, why did you cut the part when Grenier and the Russian shake hands ??
Is Brittney Griner still going to tell EVERYONE how oppressed she is?
The Military  Moto ,  "We will  Leave NO man behind "  But there he sits  in a Russian  Prison  and  this dope smoking basketball player  comes home and won't even acknowledge the National Anthem before " IT " plays a basketball game  .  Greatest County in the  world   my   @$$   !
I can't even imagine the buffet of siberian beauties waiting for Viktor back home.
Yayyy we got Brittney back you guys, soooo happy!!!
They cut out the part where Griner shook bouts hand
Weird
That's a man.
Or government is making us look so weak to world, Sadly will lose reputation for this.
More like Burt Griner
Stumbling bumbling shitshow of a president
Worst Trade in USA History...
If you do the crime do he time but this is insane she should be sent back she knew it was illegal and if that's not enough and we got her out then the thousands that are locked up for Marijuana in are country should be released  that's only fair or is it cuz she's famous or some other reason if that's so then that if messed up and unfair
The most controversial basketball trade in WNBA history
What a sad state of affairs……..
She is such a POS LOSER !!!!!! put her back in Prison.
What a waste and a disgrace
It’s like trading my Honda Fury and downgrading to a Vespa!  Wtf!
A drug addict for a warrior🗽
A worthless anti-American basketball player in exchange for a real-life comic book villain. Just when the biden administration couldn't get any lower
So many homophobic racist weak men in the comments 😆  It's Christmas time and all yall can do is stay miserable..  Welcome home Brittany!
Gimme a break!
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
Should have thrown the girl thing off the plane head first...Anti-American Biden is at it again..Scumbag
If you are white and straight this administration hates you and cant use you, if you part of the special group you are needed and used as a pawn for votes. Sad world we live in
Because of the economic crisis and the rate of unemployment, now is the best time to invest and make money. 💯
She definitely shook that man hand
Nicolas Cage traded for basketball player . . .      In all seriousness I would much rather the guilty go free than the innocent be imprisoned. Furthermore if that arms dealer was working for the US instead of the Russians we wouldn't have arrested him to begin with.
Brittany is a man
I hope she has a new found appreciation for this country
Disgusting to unleash that monster back on the world.
God, what a useless exchange. This is probably the most times a WNBA player has been even seen on screen.
Left behind an American hero for a drug addicted lesbian basketball player
Wow you can see how happy the Russians were he was set free .
Worst deal ever made in the history of the world.  Boy did we loose
How embarrassing.
Viktor Bout is the Merchant from RE 4
Bro its like  trade ben simmons with steph, lebron, ja morant, lillard, tatum and embid 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why is she meeting with some Muslim man in the back ???? Something smells bad
Lowkey should’ve kept her
Unbelievable. This is absolute treasonous acts. A pot smoking basketball player that violated the drug laws in another country?! We NEVER,EVER should have intervened. It's not like she received the DP. But you can bet our military people they have there aren't being treated as well as she was. And we trade her for a terrorist! An arms dealer who is going to attempt to and supply arms so that American military can be killed. Out president did that. That is treason. He should be h@ng.
Those are some big Russian dudes because she is an Amazon
Yaay.... He's back home in America😃
Great job Joe. Now we have to worry about an arms dealer killing Americans. We know where your brains are.
Damm this is  really live movie scene .
What a shame
This is disgusting. Lets trade a foreign criminal for an even worse one being released.
RUSSIANS MOCKS GRINER RELEASE, SAYING US CHOSE A BLACK LESBIAN DRUG ADDICT OVER DECORATED MARINE HERO - Paul Whelan
They couldn't get the marine also? You free a murderer and just get a basketball player nobody cares about and couldn't get 2 people?
They walked off free as a bird and the Brit team over there talking to who🤷🏽‍♀️?! Why she didn’t walk off free as well? Does anyone else thinks this whole thing is crazy and or feel like it was a set up for this to happen?!
Wild Theory: The arrest was planned from the beginning
Thank you Mr President!
They edit out the hand shake. STUPID WASHINGTON POST.
Now everytime you watch WNBA a country gets new guns.
So yeah edited out her shaking his hand too just checking
WHY WAS THE SAUDI IN THE WHITE ROBE THERE ❓ AND HOW MUCH CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS & MILLIONS WHERE IN THOSE BLACK DUFFLE BAGS ❓
The objective is to rid America of those wakangdians.
The wnba propably gained a new very well connected sponsor .
They want to take away your arms in America, but they hand over an arms dealer. Wtf?!??
A absolute P O S. Black privilege. After this fiasco black people are off my list. Tired of you. Don't need you.  Piss off.
LMFAO - Should have let that  stupid lesbian rot in that russian prison! An arms dealer for a mediocre WNBA player? What a joke!
We get an anti-american BLM nut and they get the merchant of death.......great 🤨
This can't be good for the morale of US military... probably at least a few of them are considering a career change to professional sport xD And who knows, maybe even a sex change :D
This was such a mismatched trade, Biden really blew it.  Typical American PR move, trading a minor celebrity famous for hating her country, for a major Russian asset who is invaluable to their foreign intelligence and influence.  Russians playing chess while America plays checkers.  It's unforgivable how stupid the Americans acted here.
Why did they cut the frame when it is Ike BG shook the Russians hand?🤦🏽‍♂️
WTF
worst trade ever for basketball junkie
Brittany is a MAN .. WTF Would Commy Joe trade a America hating MAN for a arms dealer? Why Commy Joe so he'll bent on destroying our children???
Why did you cut the shot when he shoke hands with her?
Why has Griner shaking Bout’s hand been cut out?
Why is their faces blurred?
....
Hey, Mr President, speaking about serious things, now we want the freedom for Julian Assange. let's go...Assange, Assange, Assange!!!!!
Worst trade ever.
Why you cutted out the part where victor and brittney shake hands?
Who’s the tall black man ?
Real American patriots are still detained in Putinland this very moment and yet, Joe decides to swap an infamous arms dealer .... for a pothead who shoot hoops. To be fair, the person was a woman AND a black , something Democrats can't refuse
Everyone that criticize President Biden for this exchange, JUST DAYS BEFORE WERE BAD MOUTHING HIM, FOR NOT GETTING BRITTNEY RELEASED LAST WEEK, and now that some they upset that why didn’t President Biden first get the MARINE THAT THEY TWO SECONDS AGO LEARNED ABOUT,KEEP IN MIND,THEY BEEN BITCHING ABOUT HER RELEASE SINCE SHE FIRST GOT ARRESTED IN RUSSIA, EVEN FOX NEWS BASHED PRESIDENT BIDEN TO GET BRITTNEY OUT, but now they learned about this marine,and it’s back to having their synchronized menstrual cycles!!!
We traded a wookie for that guy? What did we get besides that...thing?
Like trading diamonds for a pocket full of lint. Russia wins, and we get absolutely nothing in return.
Now do this reversal , if former marine prisoner was black and the basketball player was white this administration would have exchanged the  Marine for the Russian prisioner. Thats how the Biden administration works.
Edited trash. Griner shook hands
But we left a soldier behind this is bull
Victor Bout will now fund the WNBA, helping to increase the well-deserved low salaries.
Victor was confused who the goofy looking tall guy was 😂
I wish I  could be exchanged for somebody. Anybody. It's been so hard living in this place. I have nothing and possibly could get away from all these haters, cheaters, liars and thieves  And if I  was exchanged to a place where nobody knows me. And start life over. I might have a better chance at happiness somewhere else.
Why does video cut when he steps forward to greet mr bout?
Bro is back to business to revive isis and he will be very upset seeing USA supplies taliban with arms instead of him such loss of costumer
She gonna file a lawsuit against biden now for a hate crime for not “getting her out fast enough for being a black WOMAN”
For real she already looks ungreatful
Best Christmas gift; Ammunition factory for a ball.
This is bullshit and she does not “represent all the great things about America “
I’m surprised viktor and Griner didn’t shake hands
i like this viktor guy
Traded a nuclear war head for a sparkler…. Great job…….
In order to win a little face, it harms the interests and even the safety of more people.
If people didn't think our country was weak and dumb already this solidifies it. Huge facepalm!
Wow. Exchanging a mentally deranged criminal for The Lord of war himself. Whoever approved this is a literal shithead
Now is the time for Russians to collapse the West after they collapse the soviets
I bet this POS doesn't even lose the job they had ex convict drug user still welcomed back to the place they hate so much!!!
Who does the crime but can't do the time and gets sent back to the country they HATE so much????? Real fair trade a terrorist mass murderer for a loser ex WNBA player???
If Americans were allowed to vote on this, Griner and her worthless basketball skills would still be in prison.
…But in 2008 Mr Whelan, who had achieved the rank of staff sergeant, was discharged from the marines for bad conduct.   The Pentagon, which released his records, said the charges related to larceny. CNN reports he was accused of using someone else's social security number, and "writing bad cheques". His family, it has emerged, were unaware of events. BBC News 4 January 2019 Updated 8 December 2022
It s like swapping ps5 for super nintendo
Man how does life plays 😂 😂
Undeserving release
after all of this nonesense, she he is going to come back and score 8 massive points and 1 assist
Popping pills: 👍 Medicinal oils: 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬👎👎👎👎👎👎
putin out smarted biden again  biden got a fry putin got kobe steak
This was the worst thing that ever happened in American history
Let’s go, Brandon!
The guys having his best day ever joking and laughing with the agents he definitely just won now he’s gonna get out and probs disappear or escape and go back to what he’s doing I mean I can’t blame him I wouldn’t wanna be in jail get that bag buddy
Russia saw the opportunity and they took it. America would've done the same thing
An absolute disgrace. Should have left her there.
Imagine the U.S agents risking it all to put this man behind bars and save Americans. All for a WNBA player that dislikes her country , like wtf
Shameful.  Sorry Veterans that Joe ho took druggie basketball star over you.
Bro be like: hey Nikolai suka, long time no see 🤜🏻🤛🏻
This is like trading it with the card of trading then we swap them🦧💨
Not including other Americans in this trade is actually sinful to put it mildly
As a US marine sits in Russian prison, this clown show goes on.
Why was this video cut out. There was a point where it looks like Griner shook hands with Bout. Where is the real footage in its entirety?
We took an L lmao
Glad he's out I guess. They need to revise their laws to exclude famous baxiball playahs yee
Ladys and gents, the worst trade deal in basketball history! Is it too late to trade backsies again?!?!?
Why did we want her back again?
Brandon: "Sure this Russian is going back into gun-running and thousands will die, but on the other hand we are going to have the best women's basketball team in the world!".....
Que hace un jeque en el negocio
Putin: "Brandon is weak".  "I need to make hay while the sun is shining"....
Gee I wonder if she will stand for the national anthem now…
Wait till all the "boos" at her next basketball game, that's if they don't edit it out
Which of these two men has the better seat at the next eyes wide shut orgy
Wooo what a boss. The lord of war. Good trade
Guess we all forgot about the retired Marine accused of spying. He's still there. So we trade the literal lord of War for ....a WMBA player....
BS
Where did this happen?
Should have never taken place.  She broke the law and we got her out.  What about the other people in this country sitting in jail on weed charges?
What a disgrace
JUst 6 guys walking at an airport..................
Griner better never take a knee during the anthem again after this.
good deal... would america also exchange 1 ounce of gold against my old socks? but then your president sniffs on them... whatever
why did Brit go to Russia at the first place? what the f?
It does NOT matter now, the soul of America has already been sold to China. This was an UN-equal trade. We lost Russia won.  A wolf has just been released from captivity and will go back to his old ways courtesy of DC. What an absolutely foolish move the US government has made. Big mistake.
Wonder how much is in those two dufflebags
Griner shook hands with Bout, why did they cut that out of the clip.
Don't forget about Paul Whelan. You shouldn't leave a man behind who pledged an oath to die and serve for your country. This is an absolute rubbish decision. Letting a very dangerous Russian Arms dealer free (International threat) and getting back a WNBA player who was caught with drug traces.
There is good and bad in this. The good is that Viktor Bout got released. The bad news is Griner doesn't have to be held accountable for her actions and it shows that it you're a g ay b lack  female (?) Basketball player you are more important than a marine who has fought for the country and been in prison Russia alot longer
Why does she want to come back to a country she h8ts?  She should have stayed there. their values line up with the lefts perfectly.
Why are libtards editing this video and cutting out some handshakes?
"Oh she was falsly imprisoned on trumped up charges" yeah because which other country in asia can you traffic illegal narcotics and they just let you go?
So finally Russia returned American Garbage back to America!
Did this take place somewhere in middle east??
He jus like me fr
We traded a Russian terrorist for a worthless drug addict. The entire world is laughing at America and the biden administration.
All I had to do was invite that 7 foot black ,Ghey, blunt smoking thing here to play some b ball and it worked like a charm I got my arms dealer back!! Time to sell these ak’s!! - V Putin
Why in all the videos of this exchange did they cut out the part wher Griner gives the Russian a fist bump?
I sure would play poker with these idiots that made the  deal 😃🤣😂😅
Biggest fleece since Seahawks traded Russ
A death merchant for a pot oil user athlete, Russia a horrible country.
No amount of money would get me in China, Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, ect... Dumb, Dumb, Dumb.
She will make more money from a book then her NBA career
Over the years many have been arrested in hostile countries. WHAT THE FCK WERE THEY THINKING? No body goes to a country that arrest whomever they want!
Boooooo
How about we get a timeline for Marine Paul Whelan? Espionage is just justification for him to be released - that's an American hero. Could we also get a timeline for the "Merchant of Death"? Let's get the full story out there. Also, if they're going to let her go for "weed" possession... might as well get everyone out of our jails for the same offense. She better be saluting the flag every game. Sadly, she'll be on tour soon enough, telling her sad sob story. Make your bed, sleep in it.
He is a Jewish Russian arms dealer who armed little children in Africa. Should ha e never negotiated his release
send her back. even if russia says "no backsies" on the trade.
USA HAS BEEN THE LAUGHING STOCK OF RUSSIA..THEY STICKING IT IN WITH NO LUBE..PAUSE
What was a Saudi meeting and greeting her for??? I'm sure many Nations are happy to assist with Viktor's release!
so very bad and wrong
The incompetence and ineptitude of the Biden administration on full display.. trading a "merchant of death" for a worthless "entertainer" that hates our country. Almost as pathetic as leaving al those folks behind in Afghanistan and turning their backs on them, or trading 5 people from gitmo for one traitor... But hey, they already arm mexican drug cartels why is this any different?
Should of left her their
This moment makes me wish they were successful in storming the capital.  It so depressing to see this person out for what a e-cig
This is disgusting! What about Whelan?
Such a joke. Shouldve left her there to rot
LGBT rules the world now
a vape user who brought shame to the country vs. a marine who protects the country.
W
Let's all thank the melanin community for all their contributions to society.
Vikor is so lucky that he couldn't even believe the stupidy of how American makes deal.
This is criminal this is the most criminal thing that's happened so far this was a plan you go here with your vape pens we play like we arrest you you give us 50 million dollars which I didn't tell you and you give us our guns dealer and then we'll give you your drug addict
A bad trade .What's the real story .Too many men in women sports could that be . Or cheating of major games .  Slipping in men as women. The whole thing stinks .
These are all terrorist folks terrorist a drug addict trade it for a merchant of death
F*** that stupid b**** this is a really bad bad trade
Americans out many Russians in jail, both justified and unjustified. Those unjustified and politically motivated recover lengthy time.
Not to mention that we really don't know if she had the drugs in the 1st place. Its completely possible that 1) they were placed there and she was afraid and advised to confess by the Russian lawyers as a way to get less punishment and instead they convicted her knowing they wanted the arms dealer back. 2) Maybe they planted it knowing they would be starting the war with Ukraine and were trying to leverage both situations. 3) Maybe they previously allowed her to bring it A) because she was making millions for them playing basketball and B) because they were prescribed for her back pain but this time turned on her for their benefit. We have no way of knowing, so instead of calling someone a drug trafficker look at your own mistakes ( which you got away with) which are probably bigger than accidentally packing you prescribed meds. Republicans bad talking Brittany for 1/3 ounce of a natural oil worth probably $10 but they don't have a problem with Trump, Rick Scott and others whose companies were convicted of stealing millions. They ate fine with her spending 9 years hard labor for $10 of which she might be innocent! Fake Christians who know nothing about forgiveness and acting mightier than thou. None of these were good options. Russia was never going to give up Paul. I guarantee that Russia will ask the US to stop supplying Ukraine with weapons in order to release Paul. They are maniacal and so are republicans. A woman nor man should be in prison for any kind of "oil". Not in Russia and not in this country. Period!
Love the haircut..it's quite appropriate. Why was this dude flown to a military base in San Antonio Texas? Waste of taxpayers money for a woketard 🤨
Stupidity at it's finest
Why are they cutting the part the Griner and Viktor shook hands? They are the new bffs don't you know?😂 I just hope Griner learned her lesson and instead of protesting and hating her country, to work on understanding and helping to improve the wrongs.
Worst exchange ever. Biden sure knows how to pick them. After many years Paul served and volunteered.
Greiner looks like something that is very smelly. better get rid of her, sent him off. throw away his drugs as well to the street of philadelphia. a lot of lesbos there want drugs.
The world of power and fame can control everything like water
MAKES ME WANT TO PUKE!
Washington Post edit out the part where Brittney Griner and Viktor Bout shakes hands
Traded HER?while there's a Marine there? Should have left her there.  I' m sick of being embarrassed by classless twits
Shame on You USA, shame on You...
That's actually the biggest joke i've ever seen. and whereas it's actually really pathetic how the government runs it's businesses one can't help to ask one self... what's the darker motivation for doing something like that at plain sight.
I’d just like to know where their couches were, and parents were etc. ,,instead of warning them about what they pack going to Russia… just sayin,,🤔
And Joe Biden screams for gun control
Yeap... He shaked hands with her... Lol...
Wish they had kept her!!
Ms. Griner had gone to russia many times to play (cause WNBA doesn't pay alot) with her vape. The russians knew then targeted her & arrested her. It's all a scam & yes it sucks but imagine being her, facing 9 years - russians weren't offering Whelan at all.
SHE'S NOT WORTH TWO HOT DOGS AND A COLD DRINK.
She's trash but Biden and the people that voted for him are worse.
Rumors has it she/he/they/zhir smoked the same weed stem that she/he/they/zhir got arrested for before getting off the plane...man/shan/than/zhan.. this country ain't so bad after all....I'm sure shes/hes/theyz/zhirz is happy to be an American...🇺🇸
Talk about US getting the short end of the stick. Russia is laughing their asses off. We've been duped.
Keep in mind the US is the biggest arms dealer in the world.
The Russians know they royally screwed the USA over this one.. look at them smiling and laughing.
She effed up so bad
WTF..... She's the one who always ace away when singing the national anthem. Why for a drug addict in exchange for an international criminal?
Congrats Russian on yet another victory ❤🇷🇺 having good leaders who are strong and care about their country will always prevail
Idiots
Absolutely sickening!
Disgusting. Biden is so weak
Beijing Biden’s presidential legacy is his Abandonment of American soldiers on the battlefield like  their WOKE generals
They should have left her there. She has showed several times she does not like the USA. Plus the should have traded for our solder instead.  WHAT THE HELL HEPPED TO LEAVE NO PERSON BEHIND!!!!!
Sickening
Brittany shook vikor hand ( I know in private) look at Brittany lunge to him
Can you release the unedited video now? The one where she shakes Bout's hand?
Why would we do that? She carried drugs into Russia, she deserves punishment imo.  And what makes her that important to our society! She carried drug into another country. What am I missing.
biden makes the best deals.
F.  Ing joke
Cringe
impeach Biden
IF ONLY there was this much effort in pardoning JULIAN ASSANGE.  smh.
Joe has really lost it
The bullshit. What a joke.
A dyke for n arms dealer makes a lotta fuckin sense
An example of black privilege.
A Communist who hates America traded for a Communist who hates America… 🤦🏼‍♀️
It was at this moment we knew. We fuched up.
Nothing against her but wow exchanging a guy as dangerous as him back to a country that  Gives no fucks right now about wars and destruction …….. this is disgraceful I’m sure that guy is anxious to get back at the US. It was her fault not pay Big attention to the laws of the countryShe was at  should have let her be held accountable for her stupidity. Should have never let this exchange go through she ain’t special.
So Biden IS pro 2A now.
Put that ho back in the rusky jail and bring back the war hero not some junkie ho
So sad we trade like this and leave a Marine over there. Disgusting
I hear  BG  has 2 kids  where in the world 🌎  are they?
she looks like a dam man large hands, course voice, and  tall as  the green giant how old is the wife she's married too?
Ridiculous
Why didnt they show The Bball playing hugging the Merchant of Death??
lets go brandon
It's just a plant lol   Don't do drugs
I bet she can't wait to get home and smoke a big fat blunt and bury her face into a sloppy old vaj-jay-jay.
Putin is gonna be happy
WNBA finna have empty stadiums 🤣😂
This a mission impossible
SEND HER BACK.
Between 1987 and 2020 the USA did not purchase oil from Iran. In 2021 the USA began to purchase oil from Iran under Joe's directive.
Bravo Brandon 👏 👏 👏 🤦‍♀️
Why does the video cut out britney's and victor's handshake? Guess the handshake footage was only meant for russian TV
Evil/depraved swap.
Smh apparently she was sent to BAMC in San Antonio and people were trying to claim she was a POW. The audacity. She’s never seen war a day in her life.
She shook that Russian terrorist's hand and the media edited it out.
That quick moment at 0:17 where Bout and Griner give each other a nod. Real recognizes real.
At least Victor is free now he's a real patriot
Joe Biden.....what a dumb f#$k
Again, America is the laughing stock of the world
The world's largest weapon dealer is the USA, giving dangerous weapons to the teens in their country and givin' lectures to the world about arm mafia. Shame USA
Russians need weapons for war n Ukraine so they think VB can get it for them.
When you trade your Lunchables for a brown sack lunch
Viktor Bout, "Thanks Dude"
Worst trade in history
they should have crashed her plane
Worst deal since Alaska. I guess the Russians finally get a good deal. Good job Joe. The Art of Making Mad Deals.
Biden traded a bad guy for a bad guy , they both hate America.
Disgusting trade
Thats Cool. Thanks Mr President.
What a SHAME !!!! ... pple with $$ get away with everything while the rest of the world has to pay !!!!!
So the u.s. was against her being locked up for cannabis but.... the u.s. has thousands locked up for cannabis 🤪
Idk why but I got a bad feeling about this. Happy to see her free but is this an even trade? She was not arrested for violent crime
This has been the worst trade deal maybe ever
Welp at least she can tell her bloodline she stood a foot away from the merchant of death.
…..wtf…..this country is screwed
God this is embarrassing
Disgusting, disturbing. What about the other 2?
The most lopsided trade in the history of mankind ......
Numerous lives were lost because of this Russian. US soldiers are fighting around the world against the illegal sold weapons. This trade is very sad.
Good for WNBA, not so good for Ukraine! I bet he can arm Putin up real well. Guessing we can use more taxes to send more weapons to counter?
Yay what an even prisoner exchange.....🤦‍♂️
He sells arms to harm America; she had prescription marijuana oil in her bag... 🤔 Doesn't make much sense.
BOOO!!!   IS THE US GOVERNMENT GOING TO BAIL OUT ANY OTHEF US CITIZEN WHO SMUGGLES DRUGS INTO ANOTHET COUNTY??!!
There is American man that is white that has been there longer than her and they released her because she's black
What a shame. Exchange a dangerous killer for a drug user athlete?
The whole world, especially Putin is laughing at us right now
The big news about Britney Griner is that Paul Whelan was left in a Russian prison.
Wow, a murderer for a drug addict, Russia wins this one
Biden again gets used.   Gives up a notorious criminal to get back a gay pothead
This is BS.   Looks like Biden screwed up again.
They found the thc cartridge in a ten inch strap on!
Question is: is he the guy who is going to take Putin out??????
Dam made that girl cut her locs off she was stressed
What a win for Russia. They traded a WNBA player for someone who can actually shoot.
We are geting laugh at…
All scripted
Crazy!!!!!
You democrats are so f stupid and uneducated this is f sad
They only arested garner because of this they knew he was in the states and that’s why they got her for *0.7*
After 15 days someone would think !!! Not 15 years , boss moves Viktor
I can't believe we switched out a WNBA player who $100,000 people don't even know for the freaking guy who the Lord of War was based on
What about Marc Fogel?
first the Afghanistan withdrawal screwed up and now this flop, trading a terrorist for this thing.  just more proof that the socialist pedophile democRAT party shouldnt be running this country
Let’s just think about this… Biden is supposedly pro-Ukraine and anti-gun, yet he trades Viktor Bout (A RUSSIAN terrorist and arms dealer), for a WNBA player who wasn’t even wrongfully convicted. Terrible job.
Why did the cut out the part of her shaking his hand?
disgusting. the biden admin is looking at this like it’s a win. i don’t want to hear another word on gun control.
First WNBA trade any of us have ever heard of
My boy made it home
putin is playing chess while biden is playing snakes and ladders 🤣
Bad trade
WTF a queer druggie for the merchant of death??
Why couldn't we trade the Russians for someone like the marine they have in prison?
This is a joke right?Dang..even the Russians don't want you around.
omg she walks ,stands, looks like a man,,tall like one too. wow!!!
Sorry excuse of a prisoner exchange. We are gonna trade a murderer for a vapor with no respect for a countries laws.
SHE SHOOK HIS HAND BUT IT WAS EDITED OUT
Plunk your magic  twanger froggie !!!!
he's about to make the CODMW2  campaign a real thing.
Just go ahead and release a potential threat
She don't deserve to be free so that monster can be free such a fucked up world
The Transgressive Democrat Woke Cult Prizes this disgusting woman just because she is a Pot Smoking America Hating Black Lesbian  WMBA player And it doesn’t matter if we give up The Merchant Of Death A man some called the most dangerous man alive (at the time of his capture)  Democrats Hate America and Americans
only based thing Biden has done in his presidency
Some person breaks the law in another country, suddenly the lord of war is loose again.
This is a disgusting trade
Lol Wet Diaper for a Killer Only under Joe Xiden 🤪🤡
Another fail form the brandon administration.
Biggest Trade in WNBA History
This sums up the Biden administration's woke agenda. Trade a worthless, anti-American black woman basketball player, who's only sacrificed for herself, for a murderous international Russian arms dealer, and leave behind to rot the white male American Marine who's sacrificed for all of us.
This Country has become a disgrace. A woke gay BLM supporting basketball “”star”” who assaults her own wife and kneels to the national anthem while a military service member continues to rot. It has nothing to do with votes for lgbtq and the black community though right Biden supporters?
What about our marine
Lord of War
Just traded an evil genius for some basketball player. Weakest administration USA has ever had
Horrible trade, and they should have gotten the other 2 American prisoners for this one arms dealer. The dude had a movie made about him, and now he's back in russia?
Sus political agendas.
I will never vote for a democrat again.
Of all the people alive in the world today, there is one person responsible the most for the suffering and deaths of black people in Africa. That person is Victor Bout who trafficked weapons to corrupt dictators, who fueled conflicts and facilitated genocide, who sold landmines for little black kids to step on. Joe Biden just released that white man. Now tell me black lives matter! 😂
Top G
it's strategy they knew a bogus charge like that would be the excuse to keep her in Russia and now they got an arms dealer which holds a strategic value to the United States and because of the public outcry they had to give him up for a basketball player which holds no strategic value what's so ever it's just a ball sport and  at the end of the day Russia got the better deal
I'm so glad for viktor bout and his family
This is like trading a Nissan versa for a space ship that can jump into hyperspace
since when do we do prisoner exchanges in peace time? you know russia and other countries will start arresting americans now to get their own out of our jails...why her? She brought drugs in that country knowing it was illegal yet they let others who probably are there for jaywalking sit and rot. there is no mystery why...
We traded away a killer for tranny who can even do a layup… smh
Do people not realize that they asked for more prisoners but Griner was the only one Russia was willing to give?  It’s not like the US was only trying to get Griner back
They got a merchant of death and we got a gay basketball player. Sounds like a fair deal to loony Biden
Hipocracy,us courts have destroyed millions of lives for small amounts of weed,but how dare Russia do it
The only reason she is back is because she is black.
Biggest trade in wnba history
Begs the question,how many millions of lives has the us judiciary destroyed for small amounts of weed? But when Russia does it to a us citizen, suddenly it's so terrible ,we have to swap Dr. Death to get her back, The hipocracy is astonishing,maybe we should arrest Dennis Rodman on trumped up charges and then swap him for any old pothead,or even for Julien assange
So an American ball player is traded for a dealer who sells arms to the same country fighting against his country. Make it make sense.
Oh yeah.... USA can add another druggie...opps Russia returning their druggie to them. WTF returning her to a country that she does not care to salute to...mmmmmm. should have left it and kept the arms dealer, he more useful then another BLM
Chalk up another stupid decision for Democrats!
This was about equal to swapping a 100$ bill for a 1$ bill
What were in the two bags being carried from the Russians to the other plane? Who was the bags intended for? The UAE 🇦🇪 as a finder’s fee?
Fame or money, that's all you need. The government wouldn't have done that for you or me.
Oh great trade right there, totally worth it, everyone knows how popular the WNBA is......
America's daughter is home.
yeah let's save the lesbian drug addict give Russia back their plug and forget about the Marine 🤦🏽‍♂️
You can see Viktor is smiling - He knows business is back-
The Russians got the better end of the deal. Queer, black tatted up degenerate for an arms dealer.
Why is there a cut at 17 seconds...
Lock that b!tch back up until we free everyone in the US for a cannabis charge.
lol just as she was about to shake the merchant's hand, they cut off the footage
America, America, dear God please pray for thee
Arms dealer for this. Really, I know let's get more gun control in USA. This makes since.
this won't turn out well
12-9-2022 8pm peaceful protest Houston texas city hall
Imagine the information this guy is going to spout off as soon as he gets back...🤬
This is so fucked up and disgusting. Send that p.o.s. back to prison and release Fogel and the other guy.
Brittney Griner looks like Butthead off of Beavis and Butthead. 😂🤣😂
Traded the “merchant of death” for work points😂
Russia scored big. This is the same person that said she could beat Kevin Durant in a game of one on one. She go's to Russia knowing that it highly illegal to carry a substance. She gets traded for a much better player. What is next? She probably will be the centerpiece on every LGBT float in every parade . That is all Joe really wants is to keep the woke fed.
Lol nice edit. She shook vics hand
She's back home!!
Sickened, to the point of nauseated, that Griner was traded instead of veteran marine Wheelan whose been held for 4 years.  The bitterness is made greater by the fact that Griner proposed that the US National Anthem has no place in the WNBA and never came onto the floor until the anthem was over.
Biden: To make sure we got Brittany back I offered Russia nuclear weapons and billions in military equipment in much the same way I masterfully did in Afghanistan. Hehe.
The next terror attack will be because of the left and this stupid trade
what a disgrace.  She's no hero.  Just a basketball player.  What about  Paul Whelan ?  He's been there 4 years  .
Ask Trump why he didn’t get him out🤔
Looks like the tape was cut and started later….missing something in hand shakes
So like a KGB agent for a pothead basketball player who can't walk straight
The most lopsided trade in history.
GET OUR DAM MARINE HOME FIRST!  WTH
Released in a time when Russia need him the most.
That woman walks like a dude.
Proof of some very dodgy deals. These,are what we DO know.
Biden is making other countries love America again. The same way the popular kids in high school loved the desperate-for-friends dork they made do their homework in exchange for using his parent’s house for parties he wasn’t invited to.
VIKTOR NEVER GREETED BG??
I'm gonna speak the absolute truth. No way this should have happened. Griner made a dumbass mistake and needs to pay. Not 9 years but something. But to exchange an international terrorist is ridiculous!!!!! Typical Biden logic!
This is like a movie showdown
Deal of the year!
Disgusting. She's not worth it for a war criminal. The least they could've done is freed the other American prisoner too, but he's White, so Biden doesn't care.
Vaping saves lives,Canadian an American goverment disarming citizens,this guy will be sure to place more weapons in the streets.
Russia going to smoke ukraine out now
Now thats some previlige
What a disgusting act for the Biden WH to leave an American Marine in Russian prison and negotiate the release of someone who committed an actual crime on foreign soil, hates America, and wouldn’t stand for our anthem in exchange for letting Russia have a ruthless killer and arms dealer serving 25 years in a US Federal prison.   And the bull and lies KJP spewed trying to defend this act and unfair trade! Remember how Obama negotiated with terrorist to get Americans back? I guess that’s where Joe learned it from. You know who didn’t have to give up anything to get Americans back from North Korea?
Griners “wife” actually eats that? Yikes
An arms dealer for a dope smoking basketball player. Nice one America.
A big win for Putin! He needs this guy to get more weapons as Ukraine is draining the Russian military arsenal! Biden paid too high a price. The 'Merchant of Death' was worth at least any five Americans! Not for just a high profile basketball player and one *WHO TURNED HER BACK ON THE NATIONAL ANTHEM!!!*
they get a major arms dealer we get an antiamerican druggie and a weirdo at that
Oh thank goodness that the American Hero Britney is home , hes been held captive for to long  , screw that WHITE American straight Marine guy thats been held in prison over there for four years we don't  need him back  . We just need Britney here to shoot some more hoop . Yippee  , he's free . Brandon made a great trade  , Wnba guy for a Russian human butcher  . Im so happy  . REEEEEEEEEEEEE
Why did the russian guys carry on those blue bags? money perhaps?   Does anyone know? is this common?
Uh, Oh, there is going to be an uptick on Afro-American traffic stops.
For ever more their name's will always be linked. He's going to go back to what he was doing and we all can thank her for it.
it's incredible the usa let a man of this calibre go just to retrieve a person that hates your country and brought a vape to get high in russia. guess this is a very good day for russia :(
News flash to all the terrorist organizations around the world who want their leaders out of US prisons. Just kidnap a WNBA player, preferably one that's part of LGBTQ community.
Putin was thinking 8 months ago, hey, I got a brilliant idea how to get Viktor Bout out, arrest the black lesbian girl and trade her for him, Americans would totally go for it.
What a waste of time. Send her back.
Russia has bent America over a desk and did you know what to it............ America has no backbone ....
dose the sack want reparations for flying on an American plane, the horor
What a joke...its like trading jordan for a pre schooler on his little tykes hoop
I hope she feels intense shame.  Her disregard for Russia's law means a man responsible for the loss of countless lives is back in Putin's fold.
Thats a man 🤣
JB needs a good Impeachment... He is so stupid....
The only WNBA trade that will ever make it to the news
3D chess, Putin,; you got your Kraken.🤦
It's obvious that the video of the prisoner swap on the tarmac was edited just as Griner and  Bout was about to shake hands.
The worse trade deal America has ever made.  Good job JB...LOL..
Hold on... we traded a Russian arms dealer for a WNBA player... giving labron, Giannis, durrant, and lets say a few more other NBA stars still doesnt make the deal fair 😂 Russia took the W on this one.
No matter who was traded, that Russian arms dealer would still be freed to attack America again.
Such a bad deal what a clown show America is
The US traded a shooter for a big
Edited out griner shaking hands with him
This trade is the equivalent of trading Osama Bin Laden for Megan Rapinoe…
She made a decision to go to Russia at the onset of war in Ukraine ignoring State Department guidance AND traveled with narcotics in violation of not just Russian law but most countries laws AND pleaded guilty to such. Her and Biden’s action to prioritize her release has led other fellow citizens, truly held falsely in Russia for years already, to be condemned as the US has zero to offer for their release. No accountability for her!
I heard he gave $8B in weapons and equipment to the Taliban. …Oh wait. That was Joe Biden!
Putin clearly reads The Art of the Deal lmao
Russia is happy they got what they wanted in America we didn't get what we wanted we got what we didn't want
biden where is paul...
Ridiculous
Where is our U.S.Marine????? Stilll traped in Russia, but we get this super loser back???? The elite have spoken slaves.
It was planned?
Should’ve left her there and brought the veteran home. She’ll be kneeling for the anthem and bashing America again before very long at all.
First time a WNBA trade made the news
She was stepping to shake his hand when they cut the video at 0:17...
No matter how the Democrat propaganda "news" tries to spin it about how happy America is to have her back. Most of America doesn't want this freak back on American soil
What a sham.   We traded the merchant of death for a basketball player.  Im sure we won't hear anything out if this guy again. Yet someone who also broke laws in another country will be heralded as a hero in ours.  Goos job white house. You failed at common sense.
She's probably already thinking about returning to Russia for another visit.
Can we all agree that the fact people are angry about this women coming home before Christmas is pretty sad?
It's very sad that they cut her dreads. It may not seem important to some but for a poc to grow their hair that long it takes years.
This is surreal. His crimes are so much more than hers and he is a threat to our country; what is SHE a threat to?
Russia knew what they were doing once they got BG in custody. Free my dawg El Chapo this country is a joke
Biden beat trump ti the excahnge
A pack of gold for a pack of salt🤣🤣🤣🤣dummiest trade in human history......
Z
BLM is a sad joke!
Swap of a player with a lethal criminal. Hard to understand.
I wonder what the next thing he she going to say bad about the United States
Can we trade in el chapo Guzmán and Alfredo Beltrán for a us criminal incarcerated in Mexico
I hope she realises that her inability to simply travel without drugs means there is now a very dangerous arms dealer loose again.
Every single dumb goverment official that signed off on this should be in prison for a couple years. How are you going to relase a dangerous man like Viktor Bout for a WNBA player that got caught smoking weed. Its insane that America has sunk this low
Who is the Persian dude in the last seconds near Brittney?
I love how mad Trumpers are 😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 American Logic. -The World
Y did I think Brittany and Victor was gonna shake hands lol
Damn
They edited the part w bruh they and the Russian shook hands smh
They just traded arms dealer for a wnba player that’s looks like a man like what exactly does she offer 😂😂 she could have stayed in there a lil longer😂
Viktor be like: lol XD wtf?)
This shows how powerful are these evil people were
WNBA finna have some clout now
Griner shook the hand of “The Merchant of Death” and our JOKE media edited it OUT. She knew what he was convicted of! WTH?! This is “Wag the Dog” America now. Everything you think it’s true, is a lie.
A very sick move by very sick people.
Damn at 6 foot 9 she towers above all these guys in the video. They looked like kids to her.... Lol
If she'd been tougher, she would've grabbed him really quick and run onto the plane safely! It's what they do in movies!!
Complete  B.S
I'm happy she's home
there's an obvious cut in the video that may have shown Britney shaking hands with The Merchant... smh
That's like trading Michael Jordan for LeBron James
disgusting
Before his arrest, Bout was involved in the clandestine sale of Russian weapons to all kinds of illegitimate organizations - rebels, separatists, terrorist groups, etc. Many of these groups, due to lack of revenue sources, could not immediately pay for the arms sales, and therefore "paid" not with money, but, for example, with intelligence data, promises to commit certain terrorist acts on behalf of Russia, promises to do this or that after seizing power in their respective countries, and so on. It is very important for the Kremlin to restore these contacts. In addition, the Kremlin is very interested in what the Americans asked Bout during interrogations.
Biden is a dumbass with dementia
Glad for britney . But wish we didn't trade that dude. He's sold tons of c4 and 30000 aks etc. Or at best we could have got her and the American spy back for that arms dealer
The slag should have done her time, she pleaded guilty and no way should they have swapped her for an arms dealer, she hates America and has said so, they left the other poor bloke in jail who was supposed to be part of the deal, seems basketballers are very important in America, especially woke, lesbian ones
Nice country we live in 😂 I can’t see how Americans still trust their government no matter which political party, both blue and red have done slow ish. But hey if he’s still involved in arms dealing and this decision comes back to bite America right on a$$ very close to whole 😂 it might humble this politicians and force them to include the ppl in situations like this. You can work me to death and take a percentage of my hard earned money but I have no say so in anything 😂 this country has always been a joke.
What a shame
Here’s a fun fact: Raymond Griner Bio – Raymond Griner is a sheriff and an American military veteran who served in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969. He is best known as the father of Brittney Griner, a convicted basketball player for the Phoenix Mercury of the Women's National Basketball Association.
And yet the other prisoners that have been in Russia prisons longer are still waiting, how sad for rhem
Worst trade deal in history
Never leave a WNBA player behind.
I’d go to one of her games to boo her but…c’mon, nobody’s trying to go to a WNBA game😂😂
Why did they cut out them both shaking hands?
A high caliber criminal for a pot head  lesbian anti America? Really? You dumb. Maybe she is working for the Russians. The only winners in this swap.
A trade for a pot smoker for a mass murderer...sounds fair
Aww!  The big bad arms dealer was met with a soft and squishy hug.  Maybe that will melt the cold hearts of the haters around the world!
Stand up for our national anthem, ya Twink.
Sickening 🤬
Russia can now go back to planning the deaths of Americans. Plus keeping America’s most  valuable player.
An innocent star of basketball against a mass murderer we can see what are Russia's priorities . No suprise that vile country of mass murderers , rapists , and looters warmly welcome  one of their best.
THE MERCHANT OF DEATH has been in his jail cell plotting his revenge tour..Joe just turned his back on America and let out one of the most dangerous dudes in the world....
The first and last time people will care about a WNBA trade 💀💀💀
Biden traded a basketball star for a EVIL RUSSIAN ARMS DEALER (which Putin now has at his disposal). Meanwhile, a U. S. MARINE VET IS STILL HOSTAGE IN RUSSIA (Paul Whelan). Basically, if you're a CELEB u get first dibs to be saved, over REGULAR folks. Sends a messed up message. 🤷🏻‍♀️😬
Thank American stupidity he’s out, the legend viktor
This is all for PR,  Political party morales boost, and Biden approval rating. For the time being that Brittney was there in Russia, all the press have been talking about is her and no other American civilians locked up there.  Because she is a celebrity, black, lbgtq+, and a female he, the future votes from these group of people is why we got the priority choice here.
Biden exchanged an international weapons dealer who was incarcerated for supplying weapons to terrorists that target America, in return he gets back a basketball player.
I'm realizing more and more by the days that the illuminati is real and that politicians and governments are their tools.
It just shows how weak we became!!
His nickname is literally "Merchant of Death" and they simply let him go just for some basketball player? Not for a US marine/soldier, just a basketball player whose dumbness is why she got in trouble in the first place? USA are you okay????
How a bout a swap of Trump for the Military Guy
Why are the Saudi government doing there
Peak clown world. Truly ashamed to be American
Media is indeed fake. I do agree with trump on that one. Why cut off the footage of BG shaking that monster hand. A handshake that was initiated by her. Ridiculous
Wow. What a great trade 😐
So pos Biden trades a international arms dealer for four years
Biden administration trades a man responsible for millions of death for a basketball player. This is the world we live in. Absolutely disgusting.
Whelan is a disgraced ex US Marine that received a Dishonorable Discharge for larceny and theft. Stop pushing the narrative that he's a hero. Now he does need to come home but people forget that former Honorably Discharged US Marine Trevor Reed was released 8 months ago. Just be happy that an American citizen was released stop worrying about race, gender, social status and occupation.
Lord of war 2!
The merchant of death is free again, yay!
Left a Marine and brought back a kneeler.
It’s hysterical. I’m happy she’s back home but not bringing back a soldier fighting for our country who was sentenced for a longer time and giving up a international arms dealer for who knows what he can do is outright embarrassing. Biden and the dems under no circumstances should ever discuss about gun control when they trade away The Merchant of Death.
This shows everyone that no matter how harsh the crime was you could very well get away with it as long as you know people. If it was a normal us citizen the government would’ve let them to rot but since she is a “NBA STAR” of course they’re gonna help.
What’s in the bags and folder? 🧐 there could be more chips swapped under the table.
Worst trade in WNBA history.
This fkd up
Now I'm organizing 50. Or 100 YouTube channels. To protect human rights. Through means beyond the control of the Americans
That it is a man
You thought the Deandre Hopkins trade was bad. Biden topped that off.
She hates America and all it stands for to the point where she wouldn’t stand for it.
This has to be rated in the top blunders in his presidency. What an embarrassment. Let a gun runner go and more gun laws, what a joke. Let him go and create customers at the same time. But just like in Afghanistan leave Americans behind.
Hope she and the thousands of people whining about her think about the lives they have taken because of their actions every day and night
Lol she shook his hand to why cut it out to control the narrative
No more talk about gun control from the leftist.  They shot themselves in the foot with this clown 🤡 show.
Politics. Sucks. A notorious weapons dealer for a basketball player. Maybe Griner will appreciate the USA a bit more now. But there are others still held prisoner.
Whelan should get a sex change. That is the only way this Administration will care enough about him to get him out.
Welp America has truly gone to Ruin. Griner would not hava been exchanged if she was straight. Yes that matters. Gay is more important than bei g a true American. A selfless Marine. I hate Biden more and more every day. Truly repugnant name.
Does she like America now?????
😤I don't want to hear Biden cry about any Gun Ban policy ever again.  He released a Arms Dealer.  That is his true position....
And yet - Google just notified me that my account will be blocked for my fight for freedom! Therefore, I say goodbye to you until better times - when American fascism will be buried in the ground!
Just another failure of the administration and particularly Blinken. sad that the person who admittedly violated Russian law is free, while the victim of a Russian set-up remains in prison, but that is the way these idiots think.
Apparently, in order to return all illegally arrested Russians, it is necessary to arrest as many Americans as possible
Biden left more weaponry in Afghanistan than Viktor ever sold.
This has been worst prisoner exchange in the history of prisoner exchange, maybe ever
This was not an even exchange, but our president learned well while he was vice president to someone that did an odd exchange with the taliban.
What a joke
Viktor Bout, extremely upset about prisoner swap. Built years building reputation as "Merchant of Death" ,only to be traded for a basketball player. A woman's basketball player! Viktor says "It's insulting!"
🙏🏻
I think they edited out... where Brittney Griner actually shook the hand of Viktor Bout... which is... disturbing, to say the least. This is disturbing
The merchant of death for a pot smoking subpar basketball player 😂😂😂 we got like millions of those in the jails in the US
Not sure why Brittney wants to come back to a country she hates.
Well at least now American children will know as long as you are famous or rich you don't have to worry about breaking the laws regarding drugs! So much for that "war on drugs" BS. And you trade a woman found guilty of drugs for a weapons and arms dealer that has threatened American lives. Yep, sounds totally like a good trade. That's sarcasm by the way!
Whelan will be coming home soon. It's sad that trump couldn't negotiate w his daddy in 2018, 2019, 2020. He was too busy helping negotiate the release of 5,000+ taliban fighters from Pakistani prisons.
Should have left her there
Hes feed more than the hungry. Looks like a steak dinner walking away
I want to see the attempted handshake 🤝 what happened there that that gets cut off🤔
She could kick all of their asses in one full swoop.
She was on my mind every morning. I am so happy for her release. People have to respect other countries laws, and also find out about other countries before you go. I hope BG and all other athletes learn from this. 🙏❤️
No reason to go to Russia. Period.
Why edited? What was edited out?
So we can see them shake hands ??-_-
Ukrainians punching the air rn.
This guy with his moustache looks like Walter Mathau
naive Americans. Brittney Griner received Russian citizenship. if she returns to Russia. we will reward her
Worst day in American history
Two haters acknowledging each other...
What a load of crap. biden turns his back on a Marine held captive in Russia and exchanges a druggy for a Russian Arms dealer. These Democrats are worthless and they show how much they Don't care for the American people. Democtras are the reason our country Fails on All Levels. No Respect from any country either. What a bunch of weak anti-patriot politicians. The sooner a more powerful country takes over the better off we may all be.
Is politics. Is about LGBTQZIF people. This is a terrible world.
Sickening absolutely SICKENING
Good for them for getting back to their families
Le Chapo must be planning his escape after seeing this.
He was greeted like a hero. Nobody wanted wanted shim back. Especially the guy picking it up.
Why are they not showing this anti American shaking hands with the merchant of death? Also great move to travel to Russia in the wake of the war
They should have kept her and traded Whelan instead she has bad mouthed our country and she will do it again
She deserved to do the time WHAT DOES THIS SAY FOR THE WEAKNESS OF OUR COUNTRY, WE NEED TO STAND STRONG AGAINST DOING WRONG
I think it's safe to say Russia came out on top on that deal
Next exchange will be the ex marine for Russias Mr Bitcoin…fair exchange, sooner done the better.
I don't get it she did wrong but since she famous she gets a free trade what about the poor people we would not even get a free plate of food traded to save us instead we let millions of pounds of food rot before feeding the homeless
Horrible trade.
Why cut the vidéo
They cut her hair off
The most PRIVILEGED people on earth ( Black + Female + LGBT )
There's more people on the tarmac than a WNBA game.
welcome home, Griner. glad ur back on American soil.  /bklyn 👑
This is like trading Al Capone for Snoop Doggy Dogg.
So a privelaged  girl from the Usa, broke the law, millions spent in negotiations over a $20.00 vape!?!?
Bop bop. Take him out after the exchange
The first and last time America will pay attention to a trade for a WNBA player.
Should have left her there to rot,WP
They really edited out Griner shaking hands with Bout 🤡
What a sorry sorry trade !!!!
Damn you america that the dumbest thing you've done
Joe Biden is a disgrace.
Welcome Home Brittney Griner!! This is your country, your home, and your sanctuary!!  Savor it and teach us what you learned in your own words and let us hear the truth from you!
Trading a WNBA player who openly hates her country and can't travel without her weed for a merchant of death who will be responsible for the deaths of multiple Ukrainian military personnel and civilians down the line just so Biden can have a PR Op about how he freed a black LGBT woman. We're truly living in a timeline run by clowns🤡
Based on this I can conclude Biden  could release el chapo in exchange for some junkie in Mexico
if your black and gay you get what you want these days we brung this trash B home and left a untied states Marine WTF man
I now understand how people successfully barter their way from a paperclip to a house...
🇺🇲 Our idiotic President Bidden and Harris 🤪 such hypocrite! They earnestly tried so hard to set Brittney Griner FREE! Good job! 👍What about our military that is captive over there that fought for our country and for FREEDOM? Like to ask our mumbling Joe Biden and Harris did you honestly try as hard to get our military men home,? COURSE NOT, selfiness my God! So we trade a ARMS dealer Viktor Bout  that hates United States of America has even publically stated that he would blow up the embassy when he is set free. But we trade a anxeria druggy black priveledge celebrity in swap!!!  Who knows what this guy will do?! F*** Bidden, Harris and Griner. Reminds me of story in New Testament where Christ was over looked and was traded by killer named Barabbas!  Same equivalent as leaving those to fight for our freedom but yet left behind! Good Job Bidden, your so called basketball player Grines is more than likely getting high right now!!! 💩 Such good trade and way to go to forget our service men you talk with a fork tongue with manure flowing out! Bidden and Harris needs to go back to sewer they once crawled out from💩💩!
What a slap in the face to America!
Who seriously thought that this was a good idea.
What a sick joke.
Keep this America hater in Russia. This is a filthy thing that should not have the opportunity to enjoy the USA any longer.
Locked up for how many years in the USA? I guess we know which country victor's targeting next.
They should of been sent that girl home 🥺
Just hold his hand alright 🙄 You can tell the Russians were happy to see the Russians
It demonstrates how weak the USA has become when a really tall weed smoker is seen as a fair prisoner swap for one of the most dangerous men on the planet
This woman kneeled for us and we still stood for her I hope has attitude changed
F her FJB & anyone who supports him after this
Worst trade ever.. She knew the risks going to another country. Nobody watches the WNBA any way. Now she’s going to get arrested in China and tell them I don’t care Biden will get me out he’s my sugar daddy.. he will trade a nuclear missile for me.
Swab one drug dealer for a Russian hero?
A big win for Putin! He needs this guy to get more weapons as Ukraine is draining the Russian military arsenal! Biden paid too high a price. Bout was worth at least any five Americans! Not just one high profile basketball player!
The left, who constantly rage about guns, swapped a notorious arms dealer for Griner and not the Marine???  Let that sink in.
Britney forgot her grinder
Bowe Bergdahl, Brittney Griner? Dems are not really good at this negotiation thing!
Griner was re-arrested a few minutes later by UAE authorities for being in possession of a kilogram of meth. . .
Good job guys… Biden struck an amazing bargain..
Should send her back.
Does brittany griner realize what a lose the U.S. and the free world suffered releasing that arms dealer, due to her going to russia.
Biden will always do Putin's bidding.  He also obeys China.
I hope Britney realize how bless he or she is. Hopefully this will help her or he even the more believe in Jesus Crist. Because. Jesus Crist loves you.
Stolen elections have consequences
We got ripped off
Never again can any democrat cry about gun control. They just proved they don’t care about illegal guns getting into the hands of people who want to do you harm. Democrats just secured the release of the largest private gun runner ever. Biden is so corrupt!
Waaaaaaait a second. What's the taliban doing in this?
Welcome home Brittany Grinder 🖕🏾these haters
Bruh
Hahaha pwned USA
what a waste of a good trade!  she should have been left there,  why would we trade for somebody that doesn't do anything positive for this country?
when your bail bonds agent is russia.
It was a political move. Biden trying to secure some votes in the 2024 election but at what cost. HELP US ALL
She definitely walks like a dude
Seeing all the MAGA and ruzzian trolls trying to convince us otherwise, this is a huge win for Biden ! Well done !! And welcome home BG !!
Criminal = Criminal  Shame for the USA around the world... They should keep this garbage in TOP SECRET, hope Mr. Trump makes all the top secret files open to the public...
They cut out the part of the video where the gif them shook hands… Both are anti American losers
This is just more proof being black and LGBT in America gets you privilege, not oppression.
ahh, the conservative tears are delicious. You've all omitted FACTS like Bout's sentence was almost over - he was getting released anyway. And Whelan is GUILTY, that's why the Russians refused to trade him. Whelan was DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED FROM THE MARINES in 2008, so the US has no duty to get him back except that he's a citizen - the same as Griner - except that Griner's crime was bullshit as she had doctor's prescriptions so it was legal and the Russians had no right under international law to take her visa. Whelan, on the other hand, was a spy with false papers. He's guilty. He's gonna die in a Russian prison as a convicted criminal and spy, which he is. Sorry, conservatives, ya boy did a crime.
"Hey mizz, thank yoo vor uzing dat vape pen."  "Oh for shizzle my nizzle, use dribble down in V A. And it ain't "mizz". I identify as-  "Boris, did you get me 1st class?"
Disgraceful , Biden must really dislike America like her
Appalling. FUBAR
usa never trade with terrorists...😂
Biden Couldn’t even Talk about This Debacle without reading from His Teleprompter ?  Is He that much of a Moron ?  Or is it HE Has No Emotions ?  He is a Disgrace ! DemoRats REALLY F*CKED US With him ! Too Bad The Ignorant ones who voted for him are Still Ignorant !  He is NO Good for this Country !  A Joke:  How many Bidens does it take to F*CK Up a Planet ?…..Just 1 ! And it’s NO Joke !
wow we traded an anti american pot head for a terorist good job biden 👍
Why didn't they show the prisoners giving each other a high five?
U.s made the worst trade for a war lord over a dumbass female who got caught with drugs
Once again, the Bidens always giving Russia the “better deal.”
This world is shot.
They had a good laugh at us on the flight back.
These politicians that negotiated this ^#:#^'j has never served this country in the  ARMED FORCES..............
If Biden ever again says America needs gun control, he can go f**k himself.
We left a marine, A MARINE MIND YOU... for a US flag burner, a US anthem kneeler, LGBTQ "oppressed" moron who gets paid very well to throw a ball, and broke the laws of another country. 👏 That's a Democrat for you... actually, it's a lot like the country as it's run by democrats now... citizens are investigated, prosecuted, targeted... criminals are not arrested, set free, released early, etc.... Well done guys!!! This new blue world you've made via voting full re_T@_rded is going great! Keep going, were almost 3rd world Venezuela, you can do it!
Question is she was talking too
remember
Vlad: Camarade Victor, i need some weapons… missile What u god for the motherland? 😂
Sure glad we gave up a weapons dealer who was responsible for countless deaths... for a freakshow that smuggled weed into another country. Nice job joe!
Disgusting how we prioritize on the politicization of people of color and gender rather than character/merit/nationalism.  He hated America so the sentence should have been longer-we also left behind a Marine and a teacher.  This is nothing but a political PR stunt for the left.  Embarrassing and shameful!
This is hilarious🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Omg this is like trading Babe Ruth for Flavor Flav.
They should never have done this deal it’s sickening
An Arms dealer for a basketball player!?!, Wow..we got jipped big-time
Russia short on weapons in ukraine oh wow what a coincidence they choose him to exchange
The left's gun control push is absolutely dead. Releasing Bout is the ultimate hypocrisy in this matter.  So shut your mouths and hands off 2A forever.
I am a Filipino but Griner over Whelan? I am rolling my eyes! Who's bright idea is this? I can imagine the Russians are rolling on the floor, laughing.
Sure, let's move the America-Hating Wokester up the list & bring her home first. Let's do that. Nice job Brandon. 😞
I’d request a refund immediately…LGBTQRSTUVWXYZ Strikes Again…
This prisoner exchange will do wonders to boost the Dems 2024 reelection chances: Gain voters from three key demographics:  LGBT, women, black
Wait, We agreed to let that niglet diike out? Shea more than fycking worthless. Waste of oxygen. This deserves a 'hate crime'.
That's what America used to be. No person left behind. Always trying to get everyone home. My heart aches for all the hostages held against their will as political pawns. Lots more work to do but so proud of Biden and every American right now! USA USA!!
Now she can continue to protest the National anthem
Oh hey you killed Americans let me shake your hand : media pulls a liver king that shake never happened
By the way she walks, she probably has a kock!
🇹🇭 ♥️ Viktor i hope you don't revenge my country please
All you gotta do is snatch up an american hating lgbt woke person and you can have your way with america lol , oh i almost forgot, a blk woman because lord knows they can do no wrong.
Can I trade for a different president Asking for a freind
The United Snakes of America showed us the rest of the world once more we can't trust them for a dime. Bush invaded Irak under false pretences and wasn't punished for warcrimes, MBS from Saudi Arabia killed an American journalist yet Americans continue doing business with him, and now they traded a basketballjunky for a man responsible of arming the entire planet.
You know Biden is gonna give special treatment to minorities when he has the Vice President in the background.  No ole knows what she does but she’s at every press conference where minorities get benefited. Absent, every other interview.
Now this lickalotapuss is going to get BANK selling her story. What a world 😞
She BROKE THE LAW.  That we find the law a tad harsh is irrelevant
Perhaps, Victor Bout will donate $10 million to WNBA next season as a thank, so the NBA doesn't have to.  And perhaps, he will donate another $100 million to the Democrat, so George Soros doesn't have to.
There you go .. if you think of joining  the US military.. know this, this country    does not have your back.
Sorry but what is this? So embarrassing for the US to do that. Still a good thing for her and her family. The dude should have rotten in jail forever though.
Trans black woman who hates America and broke international law over vape pen > Marine who served his country and was falsely charged with a crime. That’s it people. That’s the privilege we live under today.
Why is there a sheikh standing around as if he managed all of this? 🤔
The America hating black lesbian ticks all the right boxes of the Democratic Party. The patriotic soldier left behind does not
BAN BRITTNEY GRINER SHE HATES AMERICA SHE SHOULD HAVE DONE HER TIME THIS IS DISGUSTING
Am coming home tell the world that am coming
one of the funniest comments yet about this fiasco. i can't stop laughing🤣
Imagine trading a wnba player for a warlord. Sleepy Joe strikes again.
Our Great Leader beats America again! Great day for a great country. Sad day for a pathetic country
No one gives 2 sh*ts that this dude is back on US soil. They should have left his azz in Russia. This is just another Black Mark in Tapioca Joe's Book! Why don't you work on cutting inflation instead of doing THIS?
Worst deal ever.
Hopefully the next wave of COVID 19 wipes out California, Georgia, Louisiana, and any other states that have NIGGERS IN THEM
El Chapo will be waiting for is prison swap.
Imagine how many people Biden killed indirectly by releasing this guy.
What a travesty
That's no woman
People in the comments upset because Viktor sells weapons, I have news for you, the U.S sells much more weapons than Russia, the U.S armed ALQAEDA, ISIS and recently the Taliban, these from recent times, we can go back to Chechenia terrorist groups and Georgia, etc... If you don't believe me, google it, it is open and public information.
Movie sh!t. Shout out to viktor
Worst exchange deal ever! The reason she was there is for the money. Let her live the "russian dream." That russian guy is going to smuggle in fire arms to prop up putin's invasion
They should've swapped her with cash or something instead of an arms dealer
Сосать пендосы
Russia wins against USA again, petty weed junkie exchanged for a global weapons proliferating terrorist.
a woman who knowingly violated Russian law, a woman who burned the American flag and knelt during the American anthem is more important to the USA than Paul Whelan, a man who risked his life for his homeland?! seriously?
Putin has played his game. Putin has made America look stupid. Now she is on her way to get HIGHHHH 🤣🤣
Paul Whelans family is not very happy. They want to know why a dogs-body black person is being freed before their son who has been imprisoned for years? It should have been both of them being traded for the '' Merchant of death '' , how could Biden settle for just this Griner sports person????
Now he can supply Russia with more arms and ammo , not a clever move by Biden when you think about it
Why edit out the part where Griner handshook the armsdealer?
Elle a fait du trafic donc pour moi c’est normal qu’elle paye . Dans certains pays , la justice est moins laxiste et c’est tant mieux . La France pourrait s’inspirer de cette affaire : faute commise = sanction et c’est pour tout le monde pareil : anonyme ou célébrité !
Bout must be shocked by this decision, imagine getting your freedom back because of some irresponsible basketball junky lmao.
She should never have made it back on American soil. Let her rot
Saudi and emirates are the people that helped break this deal.. just for your info.. the countries ppl look at as radicals are the ones out here making peace
“here’s your war criminal”  “Thanks here’s your basketball player”
This woman is gonna destroy so much. This the situation when you get lost, and your mom says if only my child would come back, I would give away my house, and then they’re like ok your child was just drunk doing drugs with their friends, have him back but now you’re homeless. She’s gonna have so much hate towards her. The US was wrong for such a trade, now putting real heroes (marines, spies, etc) in bigger trouble. This is just an obnoxious woman, It’s the same as the kid who took a poster from north korea. I wouldn’t say they deserved their fate, but going to countries like these is like climbing in the pond with the crocodiles at the zoo. Maybe they were fed and you will be fine, but maybe they will eat you alive. And all the hate is gonna go against the gays, women’s basketball, etc.
He thinking daym it was that easy 🤣🤣 we're the vodka at?
All satire
regardless what everyone else is saying, i am happy Griner is released. but I am very disappointed Paul Whalen the marine, is not released. most likely Russia is keeping him for another trade.
I’m sure the Ukrainian people are celebrating in the streets over this deal.
Welcome home Viktor 🎉
Sone phone call for your man to get.🎄
Just stop drugs!
Let's see how much she hates the United States now. If she disrespects the flag I say we send a right back to russia.
Honteux ! Une star du basket vaut plus qu’un marchand de mort?! La pression de la population américaine est déplorable 😮signé: une française
All that justice for the families who have suffer lost due to this man's dealings gone in an instant for a two bit hack who can't even play basketball.
They edited the Part where The Dyke shooked his hands 😂  Worst Trade of History
I don't mind having somebody free from Russian prison. My problem is that we have to trade in arms dealer who supplied the cartel and terrorists with weapons because some privileged athlete wanted to get high while she was in Russia.
In the sports world this trade is equivalent to Giannis Antetokounmpo being traded for… well… Brittany Griner…
Is that the dude of the Nicolas cage movie?
Victor as he's about to go home: "Heh. Thiz Amerikanz are stoopid."  Dumbest trade in the history. Biden really has a mush mind.
international weapons arms dealer released in exchange for a basketball girl with a bag of weed..hmm interesting.
They dapped my guy up. They know they won, its like scamming a retarted kid. Thanks again America for making sure that ur prized possesion is home. SMH
Meanwhile the so-called privileged white male is still in a gulag after 4 years.
this is disgusting
Why was she even in jail? This should be against human rights. Russia is different smh
This admin really likes helping Russia and Americans enemies. Biden helped Russia in 2014 when that all started. Gives the Taliban billions in weapons and hardware, and now releases a Russian arms dealer for a joke.
What a disgusting publicity stunt to get black votes. Biden is a complete piece of garbage.
Brittney Whiner. You do the crime, you do the time. Stop whining. Stop asking for special treatment. Just because you are black, it does not make you above the law. Be a man, go back and finish your sentence in Russia.
Faces were blurred as they were pissing themselves laughing the Americans agreeing to the trade
Notice the video edit of their handshake
"Griner brought weed cartridges to Russia on her own accord, knowing how strict Russians are about drugs, during heightened international tensions between them and the United States over Ukraine. [...]  And we traded her for the literal Lord of War with direct ties to hundreds if not thousands of murders throughout the world.   And keep in mind… there is a former United States Marine, in a forced labor camp in Russia, since 2018, on bullshit conspiracy charges. Couldnt even been bothered to get him out…  Hold on… last pointer…   AND WE STILL HAVE PEOPLE HERE IN PRISON, IN THE UNITED STATES, FOR THE EXACT SAME THING SHE DID"  Not saying its bad getting her out and back to the US. But than you obviously at least have to speak free everyone in the US with a simmilar charge or at least try to also free the other prisoners who are there way longer.
Welcome to home comrade Viktor!
"Victor Bout" First man alive, that has positive opinions towards the WNBA.
Male basketballer Brian Griner.
Because of Her personal fault, Many people will suffer
dang i thought she was a man, im sorry but looking at it quick i forgot it was her
They have a serious lack of judgment.
Russian official: "Viktor, we are so happy to get you back. President Putin has a special assignment for you. We need Chinese weapons to the frontline in Donbas. Can you do that?" Viktor: "Let's talk in the plane."
What movie have i seen this from?
I'm do U actually understand what doing  this deal means. Everyone they want a dangerous threat to Ur lives released they will detain and American on petty charges. And then do you know what that means....
I love the troll comments... but you know the new saying? "Once a Trump supporter, always a hater."
"I know he is the world most dangerous gun runner but she is a black lesbian"
Well is this real life, or RAYMOND REDDINGTON made a call because this is some BLACKLIST 💩 SMGDH!  TERRORIST GUN DEALER FOR A BASKETBALL PLAYER!  "BUT LEFT YOUR MARINE" 🤦🏾‍♂️🤨🫵🏾🤷🏾‍♂️😤
And the Media said Trump works for Russia 🤣🤣🤣
Colonel southern got lord of war's back again.
Edited out Griner and Victor handshake/hug
that’s like trading el chapo for a random civilian
Just my thoughts on this BS
All this is bullshit. She works for the Russians.
UNITED STATES is going straight to hell
Why it’s so difficult for some Americans to understand that keep living in the country who’s an ennemi of your can create a serious prejudices to your country. This’s so infuriating.
What a joke!
To trade a stupid girl against a real gangster doesn't seem like a good deal.
This is like trading in my crocs for a off white jordan 1.
Who did Griner meet the Shah of Iran?
People from Bartow arena in the years at UAB from 1995 to 2019 joked about the international casino system that they could individually run a Russian casino by themselves without knowing anyone in Russia or being able to talk to anyone they have ever known.  I say "good luck" to them.
Let's take a poll: who had the biggest impact on Brit's release: 1. Black Lives Matter 2. Reverend Al 3. Racist white people
We traded The Merchant of death who is responsible for thousands of lives for one WNBA player? I'm so sad for our country.
Biden can't be running again. Not bringing the ex-Marine, likely CIA spy who has been there four years for Griner is a really bad look that will likely cost him the military vote. All things considered, Griner should have been included in a deal or left there for now. This was done to appeal to liberals and the woke. Shame.
All this because some dummy wanted to bring hashish oil in her luggage. Wow.
This actually makes Man City buying Jack Grealish look good
WNBA viewership is *still going to suck* and they'll continue to lose money every year (and even more viewership now) which the NBA has to pay for 😑
Next Griner will get a medal of freedom from the President and be named Person of the Year by Time Magazine.  Just watch
did they cut out viktor and brittney shaking hands?
All Biden did was swap 1 scumbag criminal for another scumbag criminal. Both prisoners are garbage parasites. Biden probably thinks the wnba criminal is his daughter,  he is a senile old man. What a disgraceful country America has become under Biden.
What ashame that we would bring back that scumbag over a former marine.
A very lop sided exchange
Putin wins again.  He becomes even more popular.  America loses.  Griner is returning to America, a country she hates and a country that hates her.  Bout was just selling arms to Jihadists and South American rebels.  Just like the CIA.
Brintney cut her dreads ? & victor look like he on a walking battle field 😅
worst trade ever
Putin wins. Very strategic win for Putin. Not only did he get a very useful person he was able to undermine America
F B Griner F J Biden....this is the most disgraceful trade ever.👎👎👎 Free Paul Whelan!!!
how can Russia be so dumb to let go of that career criminal? USA once again beating Russia.
I do agree that if this was anyone other than a person with the same celebrity status as Brittany Griner they wouldn’t care.
Well HOPE she behaves herself she must realize  how Lucky her A@$ is to b back n America.......She needs to STOP her Foolishness 👍🤦👍👍🤦
We gotta get someone else to do negotiating lmao, we just traded a wnba player who brought drugs to russia in exchange for an arms dealer called the “merchant of death” smh
So I get to the last 5 seconds of the video and notice the man in the white robe and all I could think was him thinking "Man another arms dealer in the Middle east, Sharif don't like it."
Russia gets: Level 100 Mewtwo  You get: Level 1 Pidget
I Think President Biden got her back just to have the LBGTQ Community vote for him 2024 this was done to help him why else would you leave someone who fought for this country and Russia for someone who was in prison 10years for Marijuana😮 switch was a insane number for that but as a Soldier of you US where is your Loyalty America You gave Traded a GUNDEALER FOR A Woman Basketball player she play basketball and he play with guns and there are US soldiers WHO BEEN THERE LONGER 😮
Первым делом на на Родине она пынхет канабиса
who the hell would they cutout the video for viktor and Brittney
A petty criminal, pothead ball player for an international arms dealer.  Not quite as bad as the Taliban Five for a traitor, but just as pathetic.  And I'm sure this stoner will come back to a "hero's" welcome.  What has America become?
Why is every instance of this video missing the part where Boot and Griner potentially meet?
The next tim I hear a democratic whining about gun control!!!
Shameful. If she was white or brown, noone would care this is black privilage. She knowingly went to danger zone , is a drug addict. Why trade her for a international criminal
Fixed News & The Republicans hate any success that Biden has achieved, so they are now spreading falsehoods, fake news, conspiracy theories, that Biden preferred a drug addict to a Marine!!!  Fixed News & Republicans don't tell their dumb MAGAGA fans the truth, that Biden offered Putin an exchange that Putin rejected. Putin denied a swap!!!  Putin will only exchange one of his spy agents who will be caught by the American authorities in the future! (because right now there are no Russian spies in American custody, unfortunately!!!).  The Biden Administration has informed and explained his family in detail about their work to free him from Russia!  USA never leaves a Marine behind the enemy lines (even it's a dishonorably discharged marine, who was caught for stealing money $10,000 at his work in the army among other crimes ). Semper Fi !  Welcome home Brittney G.
The U.S has to set an arms dealer free because you like to smoke weed and wanted to bring it back to the states...The worst trade ever !!!
Is she going to face criminal charges here in America? She committed a felony smuggling the schedule 1 drug onto a plane, another crossing several state lines, and another for manufacturing since it was altered into a vape
What an absolute fn embarrassment
That's a very tall masculine looking woman.
Traded a wanted arms dealer to free her c'mon!!!
DEA agents who worked tirelessly to apprehend Viktor are punching the air now
У меня в голове не укладывается почему американцы считают обмен не равнозначным. Они никого не убили и не ограбили, у обоих огромные тюремные сроки. Двое людей в мире в этом мире почувствуют себя счастливыми. Кто это критикует у них нет сострадания.
Boy he got allot love.
Worst deal ever
Brittney has a lifestyle she can't maintain without playing in Russia.  Count on seeing her go back Feb. 23
Worse lost trade for the USA, Russia played them.
Is that all people are to this world is an occupation when measuring worth? It was a human being not one is valued more than an other.  All I see is a athlete for gun lord? so she should sit it out for 9 years because we shouldn't care about her life.   It's not that I needed proof that the citizens of America are POS that don't value human life anymore if ever. But that America is the greatest evil in the entire universe no where will be found worse. Listen to yourselves. You wanted her to stay in the toughest Russian prison for 9 years for a vape pen, your wishing her death! So glad I live in New Zealand with sane humane people and not vile evil hateful people. For all the freedoms you trout you sure lack love and empathy for your countrymen. What is wrong in America?
R u freaking serious that's a democrp t for you lo  you morons voted for him that's ok tomorrow he will forget what he did how you going to trade a dangerous man go Trump
bad trade.
U know it's something behind all this.
Am I tweaking or did they kiss?
A ну будь Мужиком.  Прокомментируй  войну в Украине.
WOW. A busted coffee mug for a Cadillac. Great trade USA.
I despise Trumplicans but this was a ridiculously bad move by the Biden administration.
Imagine the tide in Ukrainian war changes and the Russias molly whop Ukraine and the sole reason is because they let this guy go.
Americans, can you please explain to me as a foreigner what do you think about this exchange? Is it bad or good? Why did they do it now? What do you think about this woman? And why did they choose Viktor Bout? I mean, isn't he too dangerous?
Merry Christmas, Putin.
u.s got played. lol
Welcome Home Mr.Bout, we got some business to do
This shows difference between Russia and America, in Russia they will only try to get you out of pro-son if you are a friend or business partner of “serious” person or you are meaningful to them, but US trying to help every citizen even if it’s just basketball player..
The Russian army has been struggling with weapons shortages in their invasion of ukraine. What could the possibly want with the worlds most notorious arms dealer?
In 1955, The US exchanged Qian Xuesen for 11 Servicemen. Like Bout, Qian was a Merchant of Death. So, why Whelan is still in Russia???
Britney Griner, no love of country, not one bit.  Can’t wait to hear the crap that c ones out of her mouth when she lands on U.S soil
This is DISGUSTING
Shame on Biden
Viktor is saying ok I have 2 crates of ak 47s left and 1 bazooka who is buying?
Who are we trading for El chapo next season ?
griner shaked hands with bout
Paul Whelan
I wonder what it's like knowing you're the reason the "merchant of death" got out of prison early.
🤡
I didn't expect splashing Magikarp to materialize as a tall black woman with a vape pen and alpha Arceus as a Russian arms trade dealer.
No way in hell you give up a drug addict for a guy selling guns to all the worst people in Africa and everywhere else to commit crimes
Plot twist : that's actually a victor bout clone, the real one is still in prison
Traded a killer for someone that got caught with a half  gram of wax wow
wow, good exchange, Traitor for a terrorist
Semper fi Paul
She did nothing wrong n lost months of her life to a crime she should have had diplomatic immunity to
This isn't patriotism, this is down right moronic. She had marijuana in her vape and got busted abroad. He is practically an international terrorist who will now aid Putin's horrific acts against the Ukrainian people. How the actual F.
To be fair, the US is a much bigger arms dealer than this guy.  Just look at everything left in Afghanistan for the Taliban.  Of course, if you try to bring a cannabis vape pen into the United States through an airport, you will be likely be caught and charged with a serious crime... It's not as easy as bringing a few pounds of fentanyl with you as you jump the border.
Any Americans that dies or is harmed at  the hands of Victor bout or his worldwide army and PMC affiliations. including the marine that we left behind for her non-American loving celebrity will be blood that covers the soul of Brittney Griner‘s not just on her hands! as well as the people who freed her in this monumentally stupid of Showcase of solipsistic ignorance 😢
Viktor to griner  “Hi” 🚬
🦧🦧🦧 business
Such garbage. She is not worth the terriost we are letting go. The government should be ashamed. Showing how weak we are
America lookin' like absolute FOOLS! PATHETIC!!
Democrats just released a mega arms dealer back into the world. Never again should they talk about gun control.
There’s a freakin U.S. Marine locked up in Russia and we traded a merchant of death for this WNBA. Like wtf is this. Damn we look like some damn clowns. Thanks Biden, we just got f’d.
We traded a Russian arms dealer for a center that averages 17pts and 1.8 assists lmfao wow.
That is the guy from the Lord of War
The CIA ran an entire sting operation to arrest this guy during the heights of Iraq insurgency. Just think about it, it's like buying a Csgo skin for $500
You edited out Britney Griner shaking hands with the terrorist Viktor Bout.  What happened to "Democracy Dies in Darkness"?
The so called "merchant of death" has American blood on his hands and is coined as the "Bill Gates of arms dealing" --- But my bad, carry on America
This is ridiculous… how is it even possible
@ 0:22..."Those foolish Americans...hahahahaaa"
They released the real makarov from cod
Lucky guy. Haha.
What a joke
ANOTHER BIDEN GEM:  Leave all those weapons to terrorists in the middle east and now releasing an arms dealer for an anti american.  *BRILLANT*
Whats all the worry about? Send Mossad after him.
Maybe she will have more respect  for her country NOW. I wish we could send all the other AMERICA HATERS for a free stay.
wers the full vid?
This is the FIRST time anyone has been aware of a WNBA trade.
did they shave her head ?
Is that a white privilege or a black privilege? 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲😏
Biggest WBNA trade
The 2 of them would stay in jail until the sentence is done
Shame to America.........
britney didn't embrace the american representative as did the russian war criminal did the russian representative. is she just shy or ungrateful of the fucked up situation that happened on that tarmac?  also, who is the presumably, saudi representative with the americans?
DISGUSTING...The Marine should have been released first. He would have given his life for his country. She can't even listen to the National Anthem!!!
Hahahaha garner trade for merchant  of death hahaha  one addict is not worth  ir
Dam son.
Griner better make some life saving shots now I guess
From what I understand Paul Whelan was Detained since December 28, 2018. Why didn't Donald Trump do something to get him out when he was in office??????? When was Donald Trump in office again???? Presidency of Donald Trump January 20, 2017 – January 20, 2021. And wasn't Trump an admirer of Putin???? What went wrong there???
What’s in them bags ?
Russia frees a lesbian (who was caught with a vape) in prisoner swap, with US releasing Russian arms dealer mafia Viktor Bout (aka merchant of death).
Поздравляю Виктор, с возвращением на родину
WTF? Whelan got left behind over Griner? F that!!! Whelan has been there longer. Biden is no hero in this at all. What a cluster F !!!!
Brittney 'pot head' Griner swapped for the Viktor 'Merchant of Death' Bout... I thought Democrats are against easy access to guns?
This is like trading a Honda Civic for a Bugatti.
Russia was kind enough to throw in 100 vape cartridges of hash😂
Democrats are the enemy of the American people
Sad day when our government trades a known terrorist for a sports figure
Media cutting footage out. I wonder why
Biden, obviously didn’t read Art of the Deal.
Talk about a terrible trade deal
he funded so many wars
No one high profile will ever want to go to Russia in the future. They will lock you up for some bullshit and use you as a trading token. Russia just continues to ruin their own country.
Who cares that they shook hand!?!    Actually, let me rephrase. Why the hell do y’all care that she shook his hand?   Explain please..
Putin needed the merchants connections for his war.
So no more trips to Russia?
Trade for someone that hates America …. Oh wait which one are we trading ? BOTH hate America ? Wait … confused? How… what?   Lots of people live in this country while hating it at the same time. They are also given more privileges than the loyal citizens and people who serve and give back to the country. Disgusting also how it’s “ leaders “ will say anything to win “ votes “.   Sadly no one talks or does anything the original constitution was founded upon.
Man I was really expecting them to get the white Marine out first.  I mean as racist, homophobic, and misogynistic as Britney Griner has claimed the US is, it's soooo surprising to see the cis straight white male be left behind...shocking.
Should have been Whelan!!!!!!!
What a shame. Leave a marine over there and trade her for one of the world's most dangerous and deadly men.
I wanna play high stakes poker with Biden
So Russia and Putin get a arms dealer so big he was played by Nicolas Cage, and we get a unpatriotic male womens basketball player ..🤔 this will be bad for their beloved ukraine.
All you Repubs bitching forget that Oliver North sold arms to Iran. LOLOLOL
So anyone Bout kills from this point on is Griner's doing. Live with that...THAT is ur contribution to this world Britt!!!!
I hope the arms dealer has nuke contacts so we can say joe biden is responsible for it.
Every piece of news footage regarding this swap always cuts out the part where Brittney Griner shakes hands with Viktor Bout.
What's up with the sheik
Good to know that as long as I'm LGTBQTLAUX and have a bit of a social media following I can get a get out of jail free card overseas. Thank you America
Hmmm makes me want to copypaste something in the comment but i won't.
That was like trading all  of amazon stocks for a bit of weed like oz of weed
Tomorrow's ESPN, but how does the exchange of Brittney and Viktor affect Lebron's Legacy?
All her braids are gone🥺
The Munster is coming back to America? No way?!!
I wouldn’t be so happy to return to Putin!
Laughing stock 😆 😄 🤣 USA 🇺🇸 hope it was worth it 👌
I’m glad they labeled which one was the she-male.  I thought those were all men and they exchanged the wrong one.
You see that man in the white? He is more than likely the the reason Grindr is free.
Wanna bet she'll kiss the US flag now? No more protests. It's too easy to take this country for granted.
Is she gonna be considered a convict? She should be.
Some people did something.
This country is literally a joke
All them fake braids gone, sure looked like a man and walked like a man to me. I’m so sick of these DECEPTICONS!
great news !
We trade the Merchant of Death for a whining millennial vaper.
After releasing one of the biggest arms dealers in the world back to Russia - I don't ever want to hear the word "gun control" spewing from any Democrat's big pie holes again.
Stupid stupid stupid
Releasing Victor is allowing him to start trafficking again, thus more deaths in the world. And all for a useless person. This should get upset all the people in the army and civilians who risked their lives or die in war. What a joke
The giant freak who wants to be a man and plays in a dead sports league of women.
This should be a crime in itself
This doesn't seem like a fair trade
How many Ukrainians gonna die now that this fool is out but leftist support Ukraine 🇺🇦 😂 😂 😂 lmfao
We should have exchanged Biden for Griner!
Welcome home! No one should be behind bars for weed. Free every man and woman in the US serving time for Marijuana... LEGALIZE Marijuana on a federal level. End the insanity.
Lmfao... you think grinder is thinking about the graveyards full of bodies that one man is responsible for....Naaaa
For Chrissakes keep her!
Absoloutely disgrace, this prisoner swap just shows you where we prioritize threats!  A convicted arms dealer named as Merchant of Death, exchanged for a black lesbian sports star!!!  Without her LGBTQ credentials would this have ever have taken place?  NO!!
Imagine being a weapons dealers caught by America after selling weapons to their ops only to be released because of a vape pen. Like it’s great and all she’s home with her family for Christmas but damn imagine the faces on the dudes who arrested him. 😂
Biden should be impeached rn. He took a Basketball player over a Marine. Wow.
What the heck...I thought Griner in the vid was a man!
Why didnt they they show her shaking his hand?
Disgusting! All the money and resources used just to give away a guy built for this conflict that we supposedly are so against. She's gonna go on her boo hoo tour now that she was so tortured even though this wouldn't be done for any of us.
im happy for them both honestly the dude has a badass mustache you defintely need to be selling arms
Do they shake hands? Seems like they do but it was cut
This Stupid female athlete is costing all of us our national security!  She should have been left there to rot!
As a Turk  Usa… at this point you guys are embarrassing nato and your name as a “superpower”
The Biden administration was so worried about putting a "tatted feminist lesbian" and a "black" person in a foreign jail. I'm sure if it was a random straight white dude, this exchange would never happen.
What a racist situation
Why would Russia want Bout back, don’t get it?
I’m surprised it was a Muslim country they swapped , she is lucky she isn’t in jail for being gay .
What a bunch of bs they should’ve swapped for Paul Whelan instead
Thank you Mr.President.
Thanks Joez now Hunter has a new friend to get slump.
In WoW terms, this is like trading the legendary level 60 Thunderfury sword for a level 10 green sword with +1 Spirit.
We don’t want her back
Man I hate to say it but Brittany wldve just had to do the 9pc. We just released an air missle arms dealer, which could annihilate our troops and other ppl from his deals. If I was Brittany I wldve even said heck naw I'll stay if he's included in the trade, just for humanity and innocent ppl lives. She wldve been 20x richer than  coming home playing in the WNBA for them 9yrs if she wldve done that.
looks like Russia loosing the war to me hahah
Trading a Russian war asset for an anti-American druggie while leaving a true patriot of this country in a Russian cell. Absolutely disgusting.
People seriously overthinking this one.  This is a victory for all Americans.  people acting like a low life arms dealer is a superior individual.  He likely returns to torture and execution - because that is what happens in authoritarian regimes.   Brittany returns to her family, friends and life.
That is a hot mess, she look like a hot mess walking like a bad out of shape I don’t what to call it. This is the worst thing I have seen in a long time.
Did they cut the part where Brittney Griner shook hands with the merchant of death?
Coming to Netflix 2024
I though okc thunder GM  Sam Presti made some finness trade moves  haha. Russia made that greatest finness trade ever 😂
there is a-lot of people But Hurt about this one big time.
Why she has a dude's voice?
Sketchy as hell. Why is there a Saudi Arabian person there during a prisoner exchange between Russia and America? Why did they clearly edit out brittney and the war guy shaking? What the hell is going on?
Victor is the guy they made lord of war after this is ridiculous
They should make a movie.. brittney gets and fly high!!!!
Welp...think they are trying to get a bunch of us to move out...
Griner goes home to get high, Whelan left in Russia to die.  Biden POS
Viktor Bout to Brittney Griner at the prisoner exchange:  "Hey, thanks for being such a pot head."
Why cut the part where she shakes his hands? Ya'll complicit. Trump was right on this one - US journalism is pure garbage
Why did they cut out part of the video? 0:16 good job fake news
They shook hands they ended it out 😂
Sign here Mr President and you'll get a pudding cup.       Good boy..
Genuinely think you conservative freaks are just so ideologically driven that you can’t possibly even see the silver lining in this situation.   Yes, dude was a weapon trafficker. But ours was a high profile sports professional who was unjustly imprisoned for a crime with pretty wild. circumstances - she was only over there because she was being paid top dollar to play there without any information of an incoming war, and she was most likely just doing the same thing she always did, we’re talking about cannabis oil. Are you guys serious? Lol half the country is on that stuff right now.  So yes, the trade WAS fair, and obviously our government felt it was justified, and sure, it was probably for optics most of all, but we saved the liberty of an innocent human’s life by making the equal sacrifice of giving up a high profile trafficker who we are very aware of now. There are more than enough others like him for it to really be that big of an offer - again, pretty equal and fair imo.   No I wouldn’t have played in Russia, this is a proto-fascist regime we’re talking about, but I would bet any of you dumdums would have done exactly the same thing she did in her situation.   How much compassion can you lack? lol Christ
One grenade!!!😏
WTF! Damn BIDEN Team! Whalen should have stayed in jails and deal with her problem!
This is like that one SpongeBob meme where Mr. Krabs trades SpongeBob for 62 cents.
Will she protest the United States of America's national anthem..... Again?
That’s messed up that our president left a marine behind. They left a person who dedicated their life to help the US. Your never supposed to leave a marine behind. That’s why a president needs to be in the armed service prior to being elected. Because if you haven’t served you have no business running the country. Because you need to serve in order to lead you need to have experience in the field you are in. Biden is a person who takes money from others to push the others agenda. He’s a puppet for cash. He doesn’t care about the us he cares about himself and his son. Think about it.... you swap a killer for a carpet muncher? What are you thinking? What about the marine you put his life on the line for you joe?
Came for the comments. Was not disappointed.
This is so wrong. The wrong person is coming home. Biden, I supported you. You got this wrong. I am sickened.
such a high profile prisoner, biden could’ve made a better deal Griner and David Whelan for him…
Wow! Biden and his administration making America safer everyday. Boy I'm sure glad we have secure boarders...we have secure boarders right??? Well at least we didn't leave billions of dollars worth of military hardware over seas when we left right?? Right?? Well at lease we still have enough oil and ammo for our own protection of our country here right??? Right?? Don't we?? Well if not at lease we can buy our way out of trouble with the strong America dollar?? Right???
The exchange was edited… something tells me she shook his hand
Russia (plus +1) won.
Can someone explain this in Basketball terms ?
Cool. This is like movie set trading good guys for bad guys.  I am having fun watching and listening this whole thing
And no one's handcuffed
"Let me tell you what's gonna happen. This way you can prepare yourself. Okay. Soon there's gonna be a knock on that door and you will be called outside. In the hall there will be a man who outranks you. First, he'll compliment you on the fine job you've done, that you're making the world a safer place, that you're to receive a commendation and a promotion. And then he's going to tell you that I am to be released. You're going to protest. You'll probably threaten to resign. But in the end I will be released. The reason I'll be released is the same reason you think I'll be convicted. I do rub shoulders with some of the most vile, sadistic men calling themselves leaders today. But some of those men are the enemies of your enemies. And while the biggest arms dealer in the world is your boss, the President of the United States, who ships more merchandise in a day than I do in a year... sometimes it's embarrassing to have his fingerprints on the guns. Sometimes he needs a freelancer like me to supply forces he can't be seen supplying. So... you call me evil. But unfortunately for you, I'm a necessary evil."
We traded an arms dealer responsible for so many child soldiers death for a drug addict. Biden is so beholden to the black congressional caucus. They see color before they see American.
America is safer now...🤨
This guy armed terrorist groups in Africa and the Middle east he's a threat to the world
The Russian had a plan !
The next trade will involve trading missles to bomb Ukraine for zelensky's head on a platter.
That’s funny, how they cut out Brittney Griner’s handshake with Viktor
Shaking head 100 miles hour. She was talking bad about the US. N etc. She should of served her time..  Other people serve there time.We traded arms dealer for her.. She better be praising the Good Lord..Here comes those democratic votes..
what a shame.  It should have bean Paul not pothead Brittney
IMAGINE HOW MANY SPIES ARE WATCHING
They're gonna make a movie on her life now lol
She look like a dude
You'd have to be as mentally bankrupt as biden to think this was a good trade!!
Griner experiencing every trade possible LOL
They cut off the part where she shakes hands with Viktor. But why?
Dam... just like the movies!! Wow
Welp…Russia got exactly what they wanted. Their arms dealer AND a bunch of idiots buying into the division created from this trade.
The WNBA will gain a spike in views once Brittney is back on the court!
Why did you cut out the part where she shook hands with THE MERCHANT OF DEATH? 🤔
This man killed thousands of people and Americans too and sold weapons to terrorists now Putin needs him for Ukraine and then he will start wars again!  The world will pay a higher price for this!  Well, if one person is free or tests that people will die, what better choice?
😂When Timberwolves traded their whole roster for Rudy
I'm glad she's free. Should've never been incarcerated in the first place
Well now Ukraine is fucked 💥 💥
The calmness of the exchange makes it appears as if the US and Russia are one country.
Why was she ready to shake his hand 🤔🤔🤔
Such a terrible trade.
Trading a smelly man for killer 👍👍great job Joe blow
Am I happy for her and her family wow! Lots of love her way 🙏
Twice
Negative elixir trade
You just know at 0:17 they cut out Viktor Bout giving Griner a grateful smile or even a hug. He’s got a lot to thank her for!!
This whole thing is so funny 😂 lol 😂 it took them ten months to do that lol 😂
Why are all the white people mad!? 😂
THEY SHOOK HANDS THEY CUT IT OFF LOOKS LIKE
Did yall see where Brittany was shaking his hand they cut that part out
(Don Imus) 🏳️‍🌈NappyHeaded HOES
This was an espionage play by Russian intelligence. Swap Brittany out for a Russian asset. Well played Putin
России общество лучше относилось к Гранер, просто глупая девенка совершившая ошибку. Да законы связанные с оборотом наркотиков в России очень жесткие, многим ее было жалко, но закон он для всех один. Cтранные Американцы наснимали фильмов, посадили человека в тюрьму без доказательств, теперь затравят девченку.
less than 1 ounce vape cart for the Jordan of arms trafficking....Just when you think you have seen it all
Black Lives Matters
What a disgrace. At least these animals are illegal in most of Africa. Delusional tit amputated wannabe dude for a literal death dealer. America, you are run by a hair sniffing, child groping, corrupt piece of filth who can't wipe his own butt. Laughable
A ridiculous deal made by Biden. Griner for a Notorious Arms dealer who sold weapons to countries hell bent on killing Americans. Let's go Brandon!!!!!!!!!
Take a look at who she is with at the end of the video. Look at the group of people 👀 What's that all about?
Stupid biden
God is Real!💯💯💯
I shall give you this baloney sandwich with no cheese for my tomahawk steak from Ruth's Chris. Deal?
why did they edit out their exchange?!
He served the Deep State well.
Lol free the thug
As stupid as it is she got such a prison sentence, her life isn't more important than the people he will get killed now. I hope the cia put some delayed release poison in his last meal or something
Why cut out griner shaking bout’s hand?
With Bout free, Russian semi-proxy wars in the central african republic, burkina faso, and the likes just got a whole lot spicier
Best thing that could’ve happened to him was her getting arrested.
I got freed from a vape cartridge situation
what a joke we traded an arms dealer for a basketball player who hates America .... oh wait what about the other Americans being held what a freaking slap in the face .... and nobody is talking about that wtf is wrong with this picture ..... what about Paul Whelan! this news organization  is a joke
Viktor Bout's thoughts " That's a tall biotech!"
It’s as if Biden and his team want a real war lol
Shameful. Disgusting Dems using identity politics to make stupid decisions. Get the America hater out of jail and leave the Marine behind. The left is evil.
Disgusting
Viktor must be cracking up inside😂😂
They cut her dreads off..??
A big win for Russia. Congrats Putin!
what an AMAZING win for the USA...LET'S GO BRANDON !!!!!!!!
He;s like I can't believe dennis rodman got traded with me
Wait... I didn't recognize her... Did they cut her hair??? And yes, that is a serious question because that is a seriously dehumanizing thing to do to a person.
Why cut the clip where they shook hands
Just in case anyone is wondering, ​the normal punishment for Brittney Griner's "crime" in Russia is never more than few days in jail.  I remember an almost identical case a few years ago (vape cartridges at the airport) and the guy spent 4 hours in a holding cell and had to pay like a $100 fine.  I don't remember if he even missed his flight.  They just sentenced her to the statutory maximum so they could use her as leverage for an exchange later.  Which worked perfectly.  Well played, Russia.
Big fan of basketball and she should still be in jail lmao. She just forced the us to pay for a horrible mistake she made.
Biden Logic= Merchant of Death = Brittney Griner. All fans of the US. fire the GM.
Swapping a nobody vrs notorious arms dealer, sick administration
USA deep states of woke  ???
This is unexpectedly
What a waste of a prisoner exchange, swear (whatever Griner is) will never be accountable for their own stupid actions.
Добро пожаловать домой! 🇷🇺
The real danger is the precedent it sets for future wannabe lil putins that think they can snatch americans off the streets on bogus charges and try to get a sweet deal out of it
Exchanged for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout?!? Overseas us military personnel just became less safe. SMH
A pothead basketball player who hates America was picked over a Us Marine. And now Jim Crow joe and his room temperature IQ press secretary are lying about it.
Imagine trading a international criminal for a political cringe factor. This is why no one watches the WNBA..
Same way our lives are trade globally. Wake up!
Whoever approved this garbage "trade" benefiting russia should be in prison.
Wake up white people, this is the clown world you let happen. Take back control of your country. Stop letting the 13/60 have any say in what was once a great nation.
This is what happens when you put sugarplum fairies in positions of power.
So black lives matter now all of sudden, what's really going on behinds the scenes with Britney, Biden and Putin?
Traitor Joe strikes again
America looks pathetic and should be embarrassed. Why would you trade a RUSSIAN ARMS DEALER for someone who was born tall and plays with f'ing basketballs for a living?   There's literally people in America that are still in jail for non violent drug offences and you're going to let an international drug smuggler free because of f'ing basketball? The Biden Administration is pathetic and will lose Ukraine.
Aren’t there other Americans there too? What about them?!? Wth is wrong with American “leadership”?????!!!???
We should have shot down that plane.
Not worth the swap if you ask me.
not a fair exchange.  i dont think zalenski would appreciate it
I thought she hated america so much? Why did she come back?
Sucks to be Ukrainian right now
Paul Whelan served and was in one war, Brittney should be the last person released from Russia.
Just became even more dangerous for Americans.
Unbelievable. Over the marine.  Disgusting
This is what Power looks like
When are we releasing the thousands of people still in jail for weed in America.
Glad they edited out the part we’re the prisoners shook hands god’s mercy on this clown world and it ma corrupted media and government weak times indeed
About damn time Britney gets set free.
Wow dealing with drugs addict !!!!! 😂😂😂😂  probably PUTIN is happy !!!! About USA!!!!
So, Bout sell guns and kills millions of black people. Republicans call that a hero.
Wtf does a Saudi price have anything to do with this. So we trade a wnba player for an ARMS DEALER WHOS KILLED AMERICANS?????
This was edited
Derelict of duty don't even cover this.
If it was Ben Simmons in a Russian prison I can guarantee that they would not do such a trade for him.
This was a worse trade than Kobe Bryant for Vlade Divac.
Did they force a hair cut or she willingly requested? I am happy she is back in her country! Now lets bring our marine Mr. President.
I think as they are walking away the guy is telling Bout, "Man, you'll never guess how we got you back."
Republicans should be thanking Biden. They have wanted more guns for the last 60 years.
The only WNBA trade to ever make headlines.
I ain't see a woman being traded, i know what a man looks like, and the one in red aint no female.
Win for Russia…what do we get? A  shemale ball player that hates America….wonderful
Did they cut her dreads. I pray she  gets mental counseling .
Not a fair exchange but we see how dirty Russia gets.
And to think this all started over a THC vape pen.  🤡 🌎
What happened to all that caring about black people. Blout is responsible for selling arms to Africa rebels to cause civil wars. Man is responsible for the death of millions of Africans. Now a weed smoker gets to come home to smoke more weed.
Disgusting
Stupid Republicans... the Russians provided the edited video of the prisoner exchange. How do I know this? That's a secret.
I love how they edited the part out where Viktor and Brittany trade greetings
Glad she is home.
Faaaaake
Glad shes free. But what a dumb trade tbh.
I literally almost cried after I saw that they left  Paul Whelan. Imagine being him? literally a marine who bled for the country, giving him hope that he will be released... just so he gets denied so Biden can trade for WNBA player, who Im not even sure is a biological woman, who literally disrespected the flag of the USA and national anthem... and for a TERRORIST...
I veto this trade as a american
S I C K ! Leave Paul there to rot like a Jan. 6 trespasser and bring Griner home because he's the best player in women's basketball.
Why is the footage cut at the handshakes?
Our government spent tim and money to get here out of Russia prison but they left military veteran in and did not work outa deal for him.  She knew is was not legal to even fly with and to leave American soil with a with any kind of drugs is all her falt. she should have not got out. any drug not legal broke all laws drugs on airline and millons spent and a Russian arms dealer released to get het out...... weed ladyboy Vs bomb guy. thats a great trade as people are in Russian prisons for less crimes. the government left them in there. wtf she was guilty and knew what SHE was doing. millons spent secret deals made money exchanged.  for a person that knows better. as americans sit in prison for non violet pot chargers. and the goverment leaves them locked up but a coloerd lady walks free.   costing America tons of money
Why are Republicans so upset about Bout? He sells guns and that's a good thing.
When the Russian basketball team realises he sucks playing guard they gon' be pissed
The tall drug convicted dude shook the hand of Viktor. PR issues by not allowing us to see that.
There are at least 20X more Yankee-Zionist arms traders operating around the World than Russians.  The YZs just couldn't stand the competition from Viktor Bout and had him arrested on dubious American Laws ... which the USA studiously refuse to apply on their own American-Israeli0British-Indian-Turkish arms traders...!!  This is similar to Huawei's Meng Wanzhou ..arrested in CANADA.. for supposedly breaching AMERICAN laws in EUROPE....!!! The Yankee-Zionists using HOSTAGE DIPLOMACY to coerce and extort Huawei the way the Yanks did to France's Alstom and Japan's Toyota..!!  But China stared down those Yankee-Zionists and now Russia has done the same...!! Good on Russia...!!
Why’s dude trynna hold his hand? And he looks way too happy to be heading to Russia.
NO WAY WE TRADED A FEMALE BASKETBALL PLAYER FOR THE MERCHANT OF DEATH 💀
Not a fair trade! Especially during this war with Ukraine
Send her back.
A useless almost basketball player, breaks the law and gets traded ahead of people that should be released. DUSGUSTING!
Another brilliant idea of Biden. Arms dealer for an entitled America hating WNBA player that most people never heard of. We got fu cked on that trade 100x.
Well more people Will die because of his release she should have said no I'm not going to trade for that guy I don't want anybody else to die just for me and anyway I don't like America so why should I go back  today Biden slapped every service member in the face and told the American people this sports player that can bounce a ball and that's it is more important than our military members.FJB! THIS COUNTRY HAS GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION I LIVE HERE IN TEXAS AND THE BORDER IS SO OVERRAN WE JUST HAD A BORDER PATROL AGENT DIE AND BIDEN SAYS THERE'S OTHER THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT. THIS ADMINISTRATION NEEDS TO GET OUT OF THERE. HE NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED LIKE HIS SON AND CHARGES BROUGHT UP AND IMPEACHMENT. GET EITHER TRUMP OR DESANTIS IN OFFICE!
Why anyone would go to these despot nations in the first place proves they are way off the reality trail.
Lets go victor. Get on the phone with ur old connects and arm ur country to the teeth. Show the xiden regime whos boss
This makes no sense.
one dumb person gets swapped for a killer of thousands
Why did they edit Griner shaking hands.
It’s like trading a Charizard for a jigglypuff🤦‍♂️
Should have left him in jail.
Didn’t deserve it.
Got to respect the way Russia got what they wanted and looking out for their people if only America did the same for the soldier that’s still locked up
This is what Black and lesbian privilege looks like.
Who are the people on the left?
no matter what situation youre in, theres always hope. message i got from the russian being liberated.
I wonder what's in the massive duffle bag?
That POS for a dumbass basketball player. Unfuckingbelievable.
Viktor Bout "the merchant of death" had been regarded as one of the world’s leading arms traffickers when U.S. agents helped arrest him in a sting operation in Bangkok in 2008. Experts called him one of the world’s most effective arms traders and he was rumored to have been the inspiration for the Hollywood movie “Lord of War.” Suspected clients included Liberia’s Charles Taylor and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
Biden makes America proud again
Now this monster of A woman can help the US government spread anti Russian propaganda by doing the rounds on all the talk shows. I guarantee it will happen very soon.
Body language is everything:  Him-Another day in gangsters paradise.  Her: Terrified she’s in a place that doesn’t prioritize her color or sexuality. 😂
Just for this I am forever boycotting the WNBA.
🤢🤮
I don't want her in Jail but I don't want her in this Country. It is what it is. SHe a skank
What about our soldier?
A disgrace of a human is free to come back home while Paul a firmer military sits in jail. Disgrace and not right
I think we all know the time Brittany Griner received did not fit the crime. It was way too excessive. I’m glad the U.S was able to secure her release.  I’m just sad they had to trade a true criminal in order to do it. Let’s just hope Brittany Griner learned her lesson, thanks her lucky stars, and never risks her freedom over something so ridiculous again.  If she does she’s on her own.
Look how many people's moms Griner hooked up with. Serial mom banger. Someone time travel and subdue her.
The Nations involved in this should take a hard good look at this, specially Russia.  One side is exchanging a sportswoman (who had a little CBD oil) for an arms dealer (directly responsible for the death and misery of thousands).  What is that telling you?  The US should be very proud of this.
A mediocre athlete for a arms merchant with the nickname “Merchant of Death.”  We got hosed
The power of money and knowing people in the right places it will take you far in life
Another monumental failure by the Biden administration. Bending over and spreading the cheeks for the racists agenda. Proof that Democrats are pro-criminal, pro-crime.
Say his name Paul Whelan
If she takes a knee during the anthem now, I am going to be so very pissed.  I'll picket those boring-as games if she doesn't express gratitude to this country and its people.
I wonder why they edited out her shaking his hand
Back to business for Russian dude.
I hope the whole video where she shakes his hand comes out. FJB.
Yo what's the deal with the guy and the luggage something looks off. Why is he with Russian officials and Griner. Then exchange happens he keeps walking Griner and us officials pull off to left, Bout and the Russians go back to the way they came. What's going on here???
W for Russia, Fat L for USA…
They must've cut her hair then
Bad Move for USA , you release Viktor Bout extreme arms dealer. It's a good deal for Russia not for USA. Brittney will only take for granted your effort.
This worthless leach should've stayed there wtf. Shes literally useless to this country and she purposely broke their laws, which she knew damn well about because she's been there multiple times previously. She also hates this country, screw her
Ya I see this so called president traded a drug dealer for a merchant of death, and gave Russia a good win
Now might be a good time for the Ukes to do us a solid. Z used to be an entertainer, he’ll understand.
Bunch of demons On that tarmac!
America, keeping terrorism alive for profit. FREE JULIAN ASSANGE!! FREE ALL PRISONERS IN AMERICA IN FOR POSSESSION!!!  America deserves to be blown off the map!!!! Corrupt peices of shite
I'd wager that the majority of salty people have lost at smth meaningful before. Deductive reasoning.
Love You Britanty !!!Praise Be
Man this Viktor Brout is a real gangster. 12 years in prison and walks like just finished golfing. I would watch out for him
Being a good basketball player, that makes you as valuable as a international illegal arms dealer? I should be practicing free throw’s.
Breaking News- Britney Griner arrested at Abu Dhabi airport for possession of hash oil.... 😩
Brittany Grinder grinding on me tonight
We dont deal with terrorists urs you do go brandon
Just a bit of clarification for all the hand-wringers: Bout was going to be released anyway in 2029, Biden just shaved a few years off his sentence.
Yeah but...we got a basketball player, who also hates her country and won't stand for the anthem.
Yo, this is wild. Terrible.
I love how the Democrats are treating pothead Brittany Grier like she's Dr Martin Luther King Jr I won't be surprised if they resurrect a statue in her name
GIve us Barabbas
Bro the girl is 6’9 that’s clearly not her
We traded an arms dealer for a pothead
Deport her to Uganda ASAP !
Thank God and President Biden for keeping her safe and bringing her home 💙🥳💙
What a friggin shame.she’s a disgrace. Selfish bish. Should have left her there. She broke the law. Put our country at risk.
She walks like a goof
Who is the sheeks involved? so much shxxt they don’t say so much deals being done
I'm glad that the video showed who was Griner. I would never have guessed she was the tall one.
Terrible move by the USA government to negotiate for the release of a convicted drug felon but yet left Paul Whelan stranded in Putin-land. That basketball player is both ungrateful and unpatriotic to her (er.... his) own country. I see no other reason than to get more Black votes for this idiotic move on the part of the US government.
Did the check her bags for drugs?
LMFAO YOU ARE GONNA BLUR HIS FACE WHEN HE GETS CLOSE TO THE PLANE BUT NOT FAR AWAY AND ALSO, BRITTANY LOOKS LIKE A DUMB TREE
Thank you Brit Brit, for setting free the Merchant of Death, God bless, Russia.
for just a moment I was expecting the climax scene from Air Force One with Radek walking to the helecopter
I'll bet that she never takes another flight with weed in her luggage.
WNBA Trade of the Century
Russia was indeed happy to see the Merchant of Death 🤣 welcome home Viktor
Biden is very weak Trump would not have taken this deal. Just another embarrassing move by sleepy Joe.
Dawg this is like givin away lebron for a undrafted free agent
Sad day.  Releasing a terrorist for a player. It's going to bite you in the butt America!
Bullshit! *clap, clap* Bullshit! *clap, clap* What do we keep hearing about, white privilege?? Hmmmm.....
She better stand up for every national anthem for the rest of her miserable life. One up on that drape yourself in the flag that awarded you your undeserved freedom.
Send all these F*@ks to a Russian prison.
You cut out the handshake!
Why did Biden trade the "merchant of death" for a basketball player?  I think the following says its best......" I fear not an army of lions commanded by a sheep. I fear an army of sheep commanded by a lion" ...Alexander the Great
No. this trade :  one human life to another human life.  I am shocked by the comments and how Americans are not empathic, always looking for profit in everything.
Why did they edit Viktor & Britney handshake lmao 😂
That’s a bunch of horse poop
Along with the Hunter Biden investigation, they need to investigate what else did we give up.
What a loss lol
But will she stand for the national anthem now?
Worst deal. Trump wouldn’t allow such a bad deal
It's rumored when Viktor waked by Griner he said tell Biden,..........."SUCKER!"  Ceskoslovenska.
The drug smuggling sex pervert f'd up, and the American people have to pay, and that is the democrap way.
This POS wasn't worth the trade of a Twix bar ...
Britney deserves to be out ..He doesn't deserve anything !!! !!! !!!
“They called that a prison 🥴”
Released because of her skin color and the fact she’s lesbian, totally worth setting free an arms dealer. If only Paul Whelan was black or gay then he’d have been free years ago
The glue wore out,.....her hair fell out?  Ceskoslovenska.
That Griner is such a tall man.
My guess is that we gave up a hell of a lot more than just a Convicted Russian arms dealer.  I wonder if rapist joe in now going to be sending our oil to Russia.
Be afraid Alexander Ovechkin.... Be very afraid!
If it was any one of us, they would've left us there to rot.
So the US have put massive sanctions on russia and told everyone else to do the same but they will do a prison swap with russia... a arms dealer for a woman basket ball player....seems like a terrible swap
Can we trade her back for a Marine?
The media cut the tape when it appears that Brittney Griner and Victor Bout might’ve shook hands. Watch again.
Welcome home, Mr. Bout. Now, lets sell some guns.
No one cares about her
Came here for my daily dose of MAGAT tears - cry me a lake, losers!!
You all know who the BIGGEST arms dealer in the world is? Not Viktor lol. It's THE USA. Yup. We sell more weapons of death then any other country on the planet. Go USA!
It's the same as the UK government we don't deal with terrorists but they do in the end. In Britain this year a Iranian born woman Nazanin zachari ratcliffe who has duel citizenship was freed from a prison in Iran in a long running battle. She was freed after Britain repaid a outstanding date of £393.8 Million Pounds to Iran. She isn't even from Britain. After getting her out was she grateful no she complained why he took so long and blamed people. She was warned not to go to Iran but did she listen no. People need to take responsibility for own actions not always down to own country to sort fix and make big sacrifices for there mistakes. Now it sets a trend for rogue countries to false in prison citizens of countries they have beef with knowing they can swap prisoners of high value in there favour.
Rest assured any of us would be left to rot in Russia. We trade someone whose responsible for millions of deaths for someone too stupid to check their luggage for contraband before they fly to Russia. Thanks for for putting the country in this spot Brittney...Dumb C#$%@$%
If Trump made a deal as terrible as this, we'd never hear the end of it from libs
FJB
dumbest trade ever 😂😂😂😂
Speechless. The Merchant of Death for a halfwit basketball player that "forgot" a weed vape in their bag when heading into Russia? Speechless.
Save Paul Whelan, this is a disgrace.
If that blue square didn’t pop up I thought that was a huge man.
They clearly cut off moment when Bout and Griner shook hands. Fake news like WAPO is always Fake news. Nothing changes!
Let that stupid basketball b——- stay over there. Will she stand for the national anthem now? Dumb b——-.
Don’t worry everyone SF is planning another snatch & grab 😮 I betcha?!
Damn they shaved her head
Did they cut out Griner and Bout shaking hands?
Isn't there a U.S  marine in a Russian prison right now???? Why didn't we trade for him instead of a basketball player?
Thanks to 81 million of you .
Its like the Bulls trading Michael Jordan for a box of Legos
An athlete and a drug dealer? Wow the world we live in . Tsk
The merchant of death will be right back at it in no time. Good job America 🥴
If this guy goes back to funding wars, the blood is on Joe Biden's hands.
Is this isn’t a slap in the face idk what is
Maybe NOW she understands what actual oppression is…..not the spoiled, sjw, made up, self imposed,  oppression that she used to claim.
Wonder if she’ll still kneel during the national anthem now that the country she hates so much just saved her from Russian prison
So our marine is still there?
Wow the pure evil in the comments. So just leave her even though Russia refused to release two for Bout. These comments are indicative of how evil still exists in the great USA 🇺🇸
Absolute NONSENSE!!!   Someone who hates the country and a pothead!!  She is not worth this exchange!!    Don’t we have a marine in prison over there. And we left him in prison….but got THIS chick out??
looks like he already giving orders moving his arms around
Disgusted with U.S. administration
Putin learned it's profitable to arrest and imprison Black Alphabet American celebrities.
Trade for 6’9 center that still has a hard time dunking a basketball.
Traded for an ungrateful , uninformed,  lgbq who spits on our flag. She'll be celebrated on all the fake news channels and a successor to kapernick. All the while an American hero marine sits in a Russian prison. Something is wrong with all this!
She is a great American and if we had to we should have traded Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Is there anyone else we could trade them for?
This makes me sick to my stomach.
America is a failed society
BG is limping and her dreads are gone
What about the marine, grinder hates American. She wanted to stay in Russia and we wanted her to stay.
This makes me feel like I can go trade in my Nissan Sentra for a Ferrari.
Is this what they call oppression? Or privilege? I get those two things mixed up nowadays….
So we gave up the worlds biggest illegal arms dealer for a pot head lesbian that is horrible at basketball.    Dem's have a lot of blood on their hands once again.   So much for caring about gun control.   I hope this guy floods black communities with cheap 38 specials all day long.
Rigged elections have consequences
She probably has PTSD.  She needs to rest with her family members until she get's that thing licked.
So America does negotiate with terrorists after all! What happened to the big eagle?
This comment is going to piss off a lot of people but I don’t care.  If you have a problem with how this was accomplished ask yourself, honestly, is it because Griner is black, a lesbian, a woman, or all of the above?  I don’t think the limb I’m climbing out on is that precarious.
Wow that's crazy
Whose the man she’s taking to in the white clothes?
Worst trade in history!!  A guy using trangenderism to play woman's basketball for an arms dealer?  Idiots!
How wrong this is leave a US soldier to bring home a basketball player and trade for a brutal hit man. This is what is wrong with America
Weird
This is like the cowboys vikings trade for hershel walker.
Fairest trade ever
Добро пожаловать домой Виктор.  Americans pretty much kidnapped him and gave him a show trial yet they are upset when Russia supposedly does the same.
Great job Russia🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
The fact you people think you live in a Country and World that you actually understand the mechanics is beyond me. Yeah , NASA is also lying to you fools. Geocentric planet
Despicable! 🤬🤬🤬
Did I miss it or did Britney Griner and Victor Bout snub each other?
She was not a hero to me she a failure to our country, But Biden is good helping all the failures in our government as well as the people that got him in their pocket
worst deal ever she should of stay in jail that guy was to dangerous to be free.
Trade a terrorist for a American hating drug addict......🤣🤣🤣 Atta Boy Joe
Yay Viktor bout released. He's free to sell missiles to terrorists again. It only took freeing one drug addict. Couldn't put down drugs for one day to take a flight. Let's see how many lives that costs now that ol vik is free to sell weapons again. Welcome home druggie try to put down the drugs for a millisecond next time you fly.
We left a veteran Marine behind.  A father, Husband, Brother, etc... and exchanged a Black, Drug Addict Lesbian for a war Criminal.  I am proud to be an American.
This is the worst trade in US history!!😂
what a joke trade. Yeah heres your wife beating, oligarch loving basketball player back. Now give us our literal merchant of death. lol. what a deal Biden... what a deal.
Bumbling Biden left an American military man and RELEASED  this terrorist for a POT head  JUNKIE - FJB GOD SAVE THE USA!
Why is this video edited?
they gave a top communist prisoner a way for a anti American dope head just how big of a failure can our government become they are so big of failures now how much lower can they get from the top to the bottom from president to senators all the way down to the Mayers they are all failures to our country they are all anti American's people should have voted them out but Biden makes our country look like a joke again to the world he just a world failure him and his people
Correct me if I’m wrong, but don’t they have a US marine? Why don’t they do this to free him as well?
Victor Bout should sue the US government.
Aaaaaand Russian checkmate.
even if he really is an arms dealer, certainly no more than the United States, oh sorry, I forgot, the United States sells weapons to uphold freedom and democracy 😂
Well there ya go Americans. It’s all in who knows who bunch of bs. That is our worst trade deal
russian arms dealer for a wnba player. welcome to 2023 y’all. this just the pre appetizer
We got massively out negotiated
We gave them the ‘merchant of death’ for a basketball player. FREEPAULWHELAN
Quite possibly the worst trade deal in the history of trade deals
Am o the only notice the cut her hair
What a joke.
Big mistake Biden big mistake such a joke they should have left her there and gotten the military man out . I can think of three reasons why they choose who they did
We traded a guy who has a hand in carpet bombings for a carpet muncher?
Trump would never
She belongs in Russia. They had a choice and Biden Chose Brittany.. Not the Marine held on B.S charges he chose to free a pot head that wouldn't and doesn't respect America .. Just like Biden and company they don't respect America.. F J b
LMAO! They cut out the part where Griner shakes Viktor's hand. 😂
Should have left her there
Thank goodness for Democratic Leadership!
I feel like a real life Taken movie is happening and this guy about to go after Liam Neeson now
Now Putin's got the arms dealer. He will get the arms/weapons for sure to carry on with the invasion of Ukraine! . . .
I dont want to hear her on any talk shows uggg.
Thanks Joe, your dis-respect for the military just proves you are still a traitor.
There you go go buy it and finally did something probably the best thing you did since you've been in office welcome home Britney
Meanwhile, Paul Whelen continues to rot in a Russian jail. Though to be fair, he and his family said they are happy for Griner, and feel the Biden admin is honestly working to get him released. We'll see.   I personally would have swapped Whelan for Bout, then kept working on getting Griner out. But I'm not a politician trying to get popularity votes.
Shameful for America. Putin played Biden like a fiddle. And now we have less leverage to get Paul Whelan released.
Insane they do it just like the movies lol
So we go to another country break there rules and cry wolf?  Listen if you want to smoke whatever she had go for it but don't expect our rules to be accepted by other countries.
To leave a US Marine over there but trade a drug smuggler for a merchant of death is a slap in the face to every American Soldier.  Unbelievable.
Worlds biggest arms dealer deals an arms dealer in unprecedented deal.
Yep we couldn’t live without Juwanna Mann.
Junkie for a war criminal bro who tf 😂😂😂😂
We traded a pair of Jordans for Sketchers
They justes handed over the most valuable player in international arms dealing.
Black privilege
I think it’s disgusting!!! 100s of innocent people in Russians prisons! But she gets headlines!  Purely political!!! Do boost his ratings!! If I were any of the other families, I would be Furious!!!! What an even swap too!!!! Joe Biden is the most incompetent Prez ever!!!
Who are the men in suits and why are their faces blurred? Defense contractors? US or UAE reps?
I can't believe U.S.A made this deal.she had to still be in jail in Russia.
Gotta love that black privilege.
Russia owns biden
So the next step is that the US will release all the people currently behind bars for weed immediately, right?   Right?
She better never NEVER knee for our National Anthem again NEVER !!!
Who's the sheik
Democratic priorities, now instead of a veteran, she will be on every TV channel in an interview
Bruh are you fuking kidding me our country is this fuckin stupid that they actually did the trade.... fukin weeds running this country and they just keep spreading init
FN PATHETIC! Our great president at work. Probably doesn’t even know what happened. Moron!
let's let a arms dealer who gives weapons to terrorists out free in exchange for some wnba player what could possibly go wrong?
Wow
Russia gets a arms dealer, that loves Russia.  US gets a WNBA Player that hates the United States.. who made the trade? The Detroit Lions?
The Logic
Ok Mexico work out some kind of a deal to get El Chapo Back to Mexico.
Disgusting!! Biden is a limp wrist
her stupidity helped release a dangerous man, I hope she remembers that for the rest of her life
This is a pitiful exchange
You don't trade Boardwalk for Baltic Ave.
Sickening
The biden administration is a bunch of criminals selling Americans out. I can’t believe they let this communist back in our country.  What a waste
woker than woke
Yo it really went down how it do in the movies.
Bring home the other American’s.
Who was the Saudi in the background?
one of the most dangerous violent terroists in the world is less important than a wnba player that literally got caught drug trafficking wow
Looks like a cold war era movie
Wtf she dont even like america amazing she should rot in russia
So I will be waiting to see the WaPo, Microsoft Start and MSNBC, now offering a daily update on Paul Whelan. How many Americans have spent years in difficult situations in foreign prisons on drug related charges? Why was this one so important? Why the daily coverage? Biden should be negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine. Remember when we used to have actual leaders who communicated with each other? But of course then a hundred billion for the MIC would dry up. No, all we hear is this war will grind on for however long it takes (to accomplish exactly what?).   John Kirby said Griner was imprisoned for a crime she didn't commit. But "accidentally" leaving hash oil in your luggage and traveling to a foreign country where drugs of any type are severely punished is not very bright, and it is a crime.   Nice editing by the way, cutting the part where Griner greeted Bout.
He only had 7 years left to serve, 12 done I think. He was on his way out anyway.
Absolutely ridiculous
Paul Whelan, a man who served our country with honor and pride remains in Russia. Priorities right?
She shook his hand and they cut it out lmao. She probably had no idea lol
If this was a movie, I'd  leave 10 minutes in and ask for my money back. Juwana Mann makes more sense than this.
They edited it where she shook Victor's hand
It’s like old friends reuniting
Only televised trade in WNBA
Something else the Biden administration screwed up.
We all know it was obammy, obiden keeps dozing off 🤣
I'm a hardcore Democrat and fully support Griner not being in prison but..an arms dealer that has caused countless death and suffering in exchange for a basketball player?
Extremely disgraceful, literally a killer responsible for millions of deaths let go for a trash wnba player who hates her own country. Simply pathetic
Two men being exchanged on a runway you know what they have in common  they both hate America.
Traded a notorious vaper for a notorious arms dealer...who negotiated that deal?
Dogshit to the power of 10.
I intially was thinking that dude in the red jacket,would be a great body guard.Then i saw where the name thing was🤣 I'll say this though,i bet on that flight Brittney was like......and the home...of the brave..PLAY BALL. 6 Months in a Russian Gulag will do that to you.
WOW  THAT  BRITTNEY  THING IS BIGGER THAN ALL THE OTHER MEN
Griner was pardoned, so may she return to Russia to keep playing there?
Screw this joke of an admin let that nasty woman fry
No American woman should be left to suffer in a Russian work prison for a little weed if we can help it. Yes, it was a stupid mistake, but some of you are some heartless MFs.
Africans who dance naked in public to tribal music hate us for our freedom
Lol our government is a joke look up how many troops have just been left behind to die
So Putin just did a win-win
Judging by the comments something tells me she’s not gonna get the welcome home she’s expecting.
What a total b. s. move by our government.
Whoooo cares enough of this bullshit she should've stayed and our soldiers should've been brought back bidden you suck sooooooooo much
should have been allowed to ROT in Russia
What happen to “we don’t negotiate with terrorist”
WHY THEY SPLICE OUT THE PRISONERS HANDSHAKES?!!
She'll be back kneeling against this country in no time.
This is bullshit.
People are kinda missing that Bout was going to be free in a couple of years anyway cause he only got the minimum sentence for a legitimate crime, while Griner was going to be in jail for nearly a decade for something minimal. Bout would’ve been released and probably arms dealing again by the time Griner was free in 9 years.
Maybe she’ll respect other countries laws now
Don't do it Britney's not worth it. Victor very bad man.
Absolutely disgusting!! Trading a smug, unpatriotic druggie for an international gun running terrorist!! Repugnant.
Looks like the Russians were not falling for that "woke"" crap like the USA does. They must have had  a huge laugh once they realized "Brittney" is a Bret and gave "him" /they / them/ it , a prison haircut. LOL
EVERY ONE IN OUR GOV SHOULD BE REMOVED NOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is your fucked up government at work.
Viktor has knowledge of our prison system now and can abuse that for the russians. He also is a god damn arms dealer and you traded him for a random tall girl. A marine has been in there for 4 years god damn it.
The first WNBA trade anyone’s ever paid attention to
This makes me sick. This administration is utterly incompetent. And the fact that they pat their backs about this blows my mind.
The country she demonized comes to her rescue.
Russian Arms dealer looking at a stupid basketball player thinking what the hell did she do to get me the chance of freedom? Biden excited for his next diverse photo op
A drug addict for a arms dealer what a trade
Biden should be arrested for Treason , he just put every American in danger for a convict drug addict. Congress needs to act now, 🤨🤨
Who is that huge man in the red coat?
WORST DECISION EVER
😂😂 I would not be surprised if this is a movie in the future! That swap was very movie dramatic like!
So if you're a self-entitled basketball star languishing in a Russian prison you get rescued. The countless thousands of others rotting in prisons around the world get squat.
The total lack of judgement Joe Biden and his administration have is just astounding.
When you have stupid president doing stupid things.
So we just swapped “the merchant of death” that terrorized Americans and others all over the world for an entitled woke athlete that decided to smoke weed in a country like Russia only to have that person be ungrateful for the country they live in anyways…….wow. All that hard work to put a terrorist behind bars for nothing
They cut the handshake out msm is sick haha !!!
Worst trade ever.
Well gee brittney finally has a fan.
Happy for Brittney and her family, but lives will be lost due to this trade.
Fair exchange isn't wait a dam month is this 🤔
This should be treason
Should have left her there
So you can be a stupid lesbian basketball player who knoone cares about
This makes me sick she should still be locked up over there and Paul Whelan should be the one coming home.
RUSSIA got cheated, they traded Dude&Chick for one Russian man LOL
Perfect timing for Vic the illegal arms dealer to be free. Billions in US weapons bound for corrupt Ukraine available to be sold on the black market. Just make sure the Biden family gets their cut. PS. The weapons are already showing up in Europe and Africa.
His boss taught him well trade terrorist for useless people
Horrifying
I'm very glad for her and her family for her release; but I fear the death and destruction his release will impact on the world.
So weak
what  a great "deal"!   to exchange some stupid, ignorant  LGBT++++whatever "person", who btw playing for her own profit in russian team, ignoring russian laws,for hard core criminal, who will go back to his game in no time. and no one cares about former US Marine, who's doing his time in Russia for nothing. it's all about "equality " and inclusion heh? pathetic
It's hilarious every news syndication continues to use the same poorly edited cut of her shaking the hand of  "The Merchant of Death" 🤣🤣 Enjoy the programming!
horrible trade
She stepped towards him to shake his hand when the video skipped to them walking away she/he had no idea who he was.
Why did they cut the video when she shaked hands with the other prisoner??
🌎 is a stage.
Really believe if the U S  had a common sense coherent strong, strong leader the 2  would have been let out of the Russian prison the SAME TIME the U S don't have that both president and VP absolutely BAD
love how they edited out her shaking the arms dealers hand
Wonder if she’s still gonna talk crap about America or not take a knee..
That’s a loss for us we the people are now less safe than ever before and that’s all this administration’s fault. President Biden has allowed Mayorkas to destroy our border and allow fentanyl, rapists terrorists, sex traffickers,human traffickers, and so on to walk through the border with no issues.Cartels are now in control of the boarder.
Hear me out, she's a free person? Back on US soil? In exchange for 1 of the most wanted men in history?  Hmm CBD vape pen in exchange for 1 of the most wanted men? Since "freedom" isn't free, she should enlist in the US military and  sing the national anthem at every sporting event. Just putting my 2 cents into this situation.
That’s a loss for us we the people are now less safe than ever before and that’s all this administration’s fault. President Biden has allowed Mayorkas to destroy our border and allow fentanyl, rapists terrorists, sex traffickers,human traffickers, and so on to walk through the border with no issues.Cartels are now in control of the boarder.
Where’s the Marine that fought for our country USA 🇺🇸⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️WTF ⁉️⁉️Trading a traitor of America for a murderer of Americans 😡😡🤨🧐⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️Biden has got to go along with puppet masters obama and soros 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Biden is a no good bastard.not getting the Marine out .FJB
Now he could take care of his Adam's Apple..
Wait what? Why is there a random Saudi on the tarmac?
Awesome🥳
Great now we’re negotiating with Russia
I searched the comments and did find some compassion. I'm glad, thank you.
Now he can get those warehouses of weapons for the Russians to use in the Ukraine, sell weapons to terrorists all across Europe, and get the war machines going at full speed.  Great trade the military industrial complex scored an amazing win today. We will get almost guaranteed a World War in the next 2 years.
You know what's interesting? The media knows this isn't a good trade because they aren't having any politicians or anyone talk about how good the trade was. At the same time, they aren't immediately jumping on Biden for the trade, the titles aren't calling it a bad trade, etc. We saw over the last week, Trump getting blasted by the media, multiple videos of "X person talk about Trump's dinner, or terminate constitution," etc. Where's that same ferocity for this? If we don't see any media of politicians giving their opinions on the trade, show hosts talking about it, it would reinforce who the media tries to cover for, directly or indirectly.
So we get her out before the soldier who was imprisoned...
Such a horrible mistake by our horrible president. now any time any somewhat of a famous person goes into a foreign country they’re going to pour some crazy crap just so they can get another one of their murdering people out of our presence. They should have let that girl or whatever she is do her time because if it was me a single white straight male They would not give two shits about me
A professional killer traded for an antiamerican druggy.  Clear proof there is nothing dumber than a Democrat.
The racially/LGBT negative comments in here are totally embarrassing. I am sure Paul Whelan is more than happy she got set free, because as a spy, he knows better than anyone, especially here clearly, the risk of being held by a foreign government. If you feel like she didn't deserve her freedom, then none of you deserve yours.
LEAVE BRITTNEY ALONE😂
What a disgrace trading this CRIMINAL for another CRIMINAL while an ACTUAL VICTIM OF HNLAWFUL PROSECUTION who is also A MARINE is left to ROT IN JAIL BECAUSE HES WHITE! THIS JUWANNA MAN KNOWINGLY BROKE RUSSIAN LAWS and has been to the country COUNTLESS times and was ISSUED 3 WARNINGS previously. She’s a stuck up brat who’s in the pockets of the Democratic Party which is worse than the KGB AND RUSSIA at this point. I hope all these democrats children grow up to have her as their role model and wipe themselves out of the gene pool 🏊‍♀️
Happy for Griner's family but the fact remains he is against America. Why come back to a country you despise?
It's not what you it's who you know🤷
WHAT A JOKE, SO NOW IT'S OK TO BREAK THE LAW IF YOUR A PRO ATHLETE! BAD ENOUGH BUT TO LET GO A KNOWN ARMS DEALER WHO WILL MOST LIKELY WANT TO RETALIATE AGAINST THE US.
The Merchant of Death and Sanctions Buster is worth one black lesbian, dope-smoking, graffiti-covered, too stupid to check her luggage ball player who hates America while begging for help from America? The more boxes checked off the better off you are.
Just a crying shame 😢.
I just threw up in my mouth.
Atleast we did something right for once and valued American life over products, goods, and services.
Russia should have changed their minds  on the airport tarmac and kept Brittany at the best Luxury Hotel living it UP while the U.S sweat it out fearing a Russian fakeout. There should have been a jet from Russia waiting at a U.S. airport and a U.S. plane at an Russian airport. The Russian dude was ALREADY at the airport  waiting  like he was secretly released months ago!! Brittany's crime was private,  this is a  government prisoner exchange Photo OP with blurred perps.
Should have left her there to deal with the consequences of her actions. F ck her
I Call Bullshit right now. Why is Paul Whelen still there? This Man Served our Country!! A Marine that there motto is No Man left behind. And We trade a Terrible Man for a Drug addict who does not stand for Our National Anthem. Such a Shame.. Thank's President Biden. Good job.
All i know is that you and I will not get that type of treatment. We be dead behind that bar.
A guy for a guy, a tooth for a tooth.
Let's go brandon! Sing it with me now!
So they get the world's most prolific arms dealer back and we get an America hating drug addict instead of a United States Marine. F*ck you Joe Biden I hope you burn in hell.
I hope I see this guy in person. 🤜💩
Nobody cares about Britney except for people with purple hair. Should have traded the veteran for victor at least.
Embarrassing
AND THIS IS HOW CALL OF DUTY 4 BEGAN🤣💯💯☠️☠️☠️
And there's the reason why everybody laughs at America now. Especially when you got a clown in office
Let’s trade one of the most dangerous criminals on the planet for a basketball player no one even really cared to know before she got famous by getting arrested. Seems like a fair trade to me. Good going Biden. 🤡
This could be the beginning of Die Hard 6... Bruce we need you to get well
We could have made a better deal since getting her back and leaving a US Marine over their was so important. We could have traded joe and harris, how could Russia lose on a 2 for 1 trade?
Disgusting
You bring drugs into a foreign country and you’re unjustly tried??? Gtfo
This is madness, Biden is simply awful and needs to be impeached. And anyone one who agreed to this trade needs to be held accountable and dismissed from office. To trade a terrorist for an american hating pothead WNBA player is astonishing and disgusting and to leave an imprisoned Marine still behind bars is unacceptable. FJB
BOOOO. I wanted her to be held responsible for her actions
Every death he causes as  an arms dealer from here on out is on her hands.  Pretty tough to live with that reality.
This exchange should not even be happening. First off, its nowhere near an equitable trade.
AMAZING!!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🙌🏼 while our Marine, Paul Whelan has been sitting in a Russian jail since 2018. Guess he was the wrong kind of a warrior. He wasn’t the social justice kind.
United States fucked up man they shouldn't never made this deal. This is extremely dangerous
DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@!@@@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0:13 "Welcome back home Lord of War...we need your help in this Ukrainian crisis"
This is NOT something we should be celebrating or act proud of. There are still millions of Americans locked in AMERICAN PRISONS due to the same “crime” this pampered, America hating citizen was popped for. That alone is really fucked up. And that’s BEFORE you throw in she was traded for a guy literally named “the merchant of death.” This is not something to be celebrated or proud of
Trading gun runners for some useless human who hates her own country. Sounds like Brandon's America
Jar Jar Binks was traded for weapons terrorist who has killed 1000's of people. Why not Navy Seal Whelan? Ohhh! That's right, the WH rejected that idea. Instead we get boy pretending to be a girl.
Absolutely disgusting and disgraceful. The left is the enemy.
wasnt there a marine involved?
This is a surprise
They should have left her to rot in the Russian prison. 👹👹👹
And the navy veteran geta left behind!   THIS F**KING INSANE!!
A vape pen for a Russian arms dealer 😂😂😂😂😂 god America’s so fucked
For the people that says “white Privilege” still exist, this is a perfect example to see that it isnt true. That all i got to say……
BULL____. She needs to rot over there and he needs to be drawn and quartered !!!!!!!
She. Lol. I mean he can't make it in a women's prison. Back to kneeling I guess
Wow . That prison camp made her shave her head . So sad and inhumane
Ridiculous!!!, whole thing is absolutely ridiculous
Worst trade ever! Biden continues to lose.
Thank god our tranny WNBA star is coming home at last!
So if this guy ends up getting more innocents killed, then our elected officials who arranged this deal should be charged with high crimes…. Right?
Let's go Brandon!!!
No way! We traded a bomb maker for a wnba player?! 😬
When you fully understand that Joe Biden and the democrats are actively trying to destroy America,  it makes sense why they traded for a drug addicted  America hating tranny instead off United States Marine.  Like yeah here you take the world's most prolific arms dealer... and we'll take back a traitor.
This is what having a weak leader looks like
If you don’t agree with this trade… then you ain’t black!!!
Damn it we could have used her in Wagner destroying the Russian govt..long live the feds
Great. America went from world superpower to complete laughingstock in less than one Presidential term.
He looks like a really nice guy!! I highly doubt ukrain has anything to worry about!!!🤔🤔🤔
What a travesty.
Wwelcome back home America hater woke warrior. 😂
why is the federal government trading prisoners when marijuana is a class 1 drug under federal law
Leave her in Russia!!!
So tell USA, about the Russian guy that was trade for her! Never heard of the Russian!..
Poor girl, now she has to listen to the American anthem again and she so said she hated that.
Look how they edited the video she shook the other convicts hand she's an insider
And the revenge plot to destroy America begins 😂
Disgusting our government has become...
This is top tier pandering. The left will eat it up not realizing it’s a pacifier/ distraction for the horrible things to come.
Idiotic. Hmmm… I’ll trade you a self entitled POS for a arms dealer that is responsible for thousands of deaths, sounds fair.
Pathetic
No she can not stand for the national anthem an turn her back to the flag again because that’s her choice but guess she needed USA more then she thought what a joke
Why can't these people negotiate to end the war? Our priorities suck.
To everyone who voted for this clown in office, I hope your happy with this and reap the seeds you sowed
Now "The Merchant of Death" can sell his weapons to the Cartel crossing our open borders. WTF
Welcome Home Brittney Griner but lets NOT forget our Marine and the others rotting in Russian Prisons❤️🇺🇸❤️
Isn't that the woman's basketball player that doesn't like America. They could have kept her. Maybe she'll have more appreciation where she comes from... Instead of complaining all the time how she's not it doesn't have freedom... The 10x10 cell that's a lot of freedom in Russia..
Sickening, now watch Americans suffer dearly because of this disgusting trade for a worldwide renowned drug smuggler who dribbles, while veterans get left behind.
I never want this admin to say another word about fun control.
Brandon
Biden is such a usless dumb a hole
Ridiculous.
Oh crap.....now were about to hear how terrible America is again.  Interviews on every MSM channel.
At first, I thought it was all men! Took me a minute to realize which one was Britney.
Should have exchanged Joe Biden for the dribbling @#$%
Where did this exchange take place?
Wow.  American stupidity is on a new level these days.  I'm kinda hoping for ww3 tbh.
There is a US marine and numerous other AMERICANs in Russia jail and Biden used his bargaining power for a woman who won't stand for the National Anthem.  AND THEY GOT an arms dealer. Who got screwed in this trade?🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
So this Brittany crap was all a setup to get someone back to Russia? Of course it was! See America, if you pay close attention, you’ll notice how much an enemy we are NOT with Russia. Everything is just a game. A chess game in which anyone can be a pawn at any given time.
Should have freed the Marine first! She broke laws and should be treated as such.
Watch Griner after the exchange. She is shaking the hand of the Saudi prince. THAT my friends is what it’s all about. Looks like she gets to play “hide the balls” from the Saudi’s.
We did it Joe
This is disgusting that she is set free and she hates the US.
This is why all Americans need to leave Russia ASAP. Russia can arrest anyone to use them as bargaining chips to get their criminal henchmen back.
War criminal for a “basketball player”? Ooooook.
Biden... thank you for making this world a safer place... you and your administration are representing america so well on the world stage. Arms dealer for a WNBA player... makes cents.
This man is gonna play a HUGE role in the Ukrainian war !!! Wtf are we doing ?
Brandon settled for so little in trade.
What an embarrassment for our country.
Christmas came early in America 🇺🇸 thanks grandpa joe 🤮
So trade a bomb expert for a basketball player? Sounds fair boy did we get a good deal!
This looks straight out of Hollywood.  Just missing the exciting music.
Good time for a drone !
We exchanged trash for trash... Good job America!.
This is crazy , she needed to do her time.
What a disgrace. I want to trade Biden for some dog poop.
What an absolute DISGRACE......... Add it to the long list of boneheaded decisions made by this incompetent administration.
And yet we leave our military vet Paul Whelan behind. This is absolutely disgraceful. F*** Joe Biden and f*** all of you who support him and his incompetent administration.
What a waste of a prisoner exchange. Dude was an arms dealer.
You are nothing but a fool and your children are fools if they go and serve in the military decent people need to stop serving let the country fall as it may
Set him free so her can go back to doing the same thing or worse. Guess she should feel proud that her life is more important than the Marine they left behind. And she is anti american
Now we’re going to hear about what a hero she is for the next two weeks 🤮
Brittney looks like a man 🧐
Imagine being such a bitter little jerkoff that you want to see an American citizen imprisoned in a foreign country for having a different opinion.
I’ve always said this administration was the biggest embarrassment in the history of the US. Now it’s even worse. Just shows the incompetence. How do release a prisoner of that caliber for a anti American POS? Oh wait is because of her pigmentation. Because if she wasn’t it never would have happened.
These comments are packed with factually incorrect information. Americans, please fact check your facts. Facebook is not a news source, and Google is not an unbiased search engine. It's looking more and more like the end times.
Absolutely disgusting that this occurred, thanks to the POS president in the US
Should have given them Trump for free
Totally disgusting!
We get an ungrateful dike , they get an arms trafficking intelligence asset who’s weapons have been used on U.S. / British : French forces around the globe . Totally  a fair trade right ?
I mean they traded predator for lord of war seems fair
Folks, the colossal FU is going to come back to hurt us…..our government is run by morons.
Russia should have accepted Paul Whelan as well in the trade for one of their most prolific arms dealers.
If any country wants to trade. Just kidnap a professional athlete from the US.
God's sake they actually did the exchange, the americans have officially stopped being the police of the world to become the world's jester
Another brilliant move from Biden. He should have just released Viktor to the Russians and had them keep her as well.
This happened yesterday  , so remember December 7 th as Mrs Griener free day
Welcome back Brittney Griner. Enjoy your Christmas holiday amongst your family and friends.
And a marine is left behind yet an American that hates America comes home.
We trade an arms dealer for a wax smoking WNBA player…. They got a hell of a deal
DISGUSTING
they cut the part where brit shook the arms dealers hand wtf
Democratic party at it's finest
Will she still take a knee during the National Anthem? Lol
This is absolutely embarrassing and shows just how truly weak we appear to the rest of the world under this incompetent administration.........
Griner should've dunked on him right there
USA traded a lethal shooter for a center...Big L.
Question Why Did Trump not Free the Marine it happened on his watch??....... Exactly
Did biden just fund russias war effort in ukraine?
Lots of misinformation in the comments. It was reported earlier that this exchange was not easy and the US tried to get both US prisoners exchanged for one Russian prisoner, but Russia made clear that they would only allow Brittney to be exchanged. This is a very good thing.
Disgusting
America has sunk to a new low. Can’t wait until Griner takes a knee and tells ‘Merica to eff itself. It deserves that humiliation.
I wonder how all those who are ranting and raving about this story would feel if Brittney were a member of their family.
Cut out right before she shook his hand lol
Lol this was done purposely
Fuk grinder an biden💯🤡💩👸🏻🤣
We left our spy there, and traded it for ungrateful American..."  Wow !!!
So BoBo Biden is against Americans legally having guns but signs over a man who made a living selling gun illegally? Makes sense.
Terrible swap .
There's still a marine locked up in Russia and we swap for her????? Or him whatever it is called
I’m not sure which one is the woman they all look like men 😂
Definitely not an even trade 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
So we traded the "Merchant of Death" for an anti-american lesbian basketball player?  God the Biden Administration are sick.
Should have got whelan also in on the trade
A lot of people are going to die because of this bullshit trade!
TRADED A WAR CRIMINAL FOR A MBA NON BININARY AMERICA HATER .  THE MAN THEY CALL ARMS OF DEATH ,FOR A NOBODY WHILE A TEACHER AND A MILITARY MAN SITS AND ROTS IN RUSSIA.  WOW . F TARDS  ABLAZE . NOW YOU WONT LET US OWN HIGH POWERED RIFFLES BUT YOU WILL LET A WAR CRIMINAL LOOSE . TYPICAL DEMOCRAT . THIS IS BEYOND ANYTHING PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD EVER DO IN YOUR IMAGINATION OF HIM . PROVING ONCE AGAIN. DUMB AND DUMMER . CANT WAIT FOR THE MEMES ON THIS . GONNA BE GOOD 👍
Now she should do jail time here for being stupid; how tf are we trading a man who committed crimes against the integrity of this country to WNBA player
Russian Terrorist  like “Who tf is the giant black man they are trading me for!?? “
The Russian dude is thinking all this happened from a vape pen, what a world we live in.
This is wrong on so many levels.
this proves that we HAVE INCOMPETENT IMBECILES LYING DUMB FUCKS IN OUR GOVERNMENT !!!
1st off she broke the law ....2nd she admitted to breaking the law in Russia .the punishment might have been very steep yes ... but understand in every country the laws are not the same also the penalty for breaking the law. Now let's get to the  our current army member being locked up in Russia. I sure kno he didn't break any law n what's makes it worse he 1 of our sworn warriors that will loose his life to defend our land us soil and yet a sports player who broke the law got free over a US service member 🤔... just sad 😔 he's still there .....# Biden did this for political points .but it's looks very distasteful to our service members .
Such a stupid move on our part…
Why cut the video where britney(male) was shaking the bouts hand?
Just comes to show the kind of people each government values.
Joe Biden made the Taliban great again by leaving them 100,000 weapons now he’s gonna make Russia great again by releasing the most prolific arms dealer that Russia has well has now, let’s go Brandon!
For a basketball player?
You belong in Russia with all the other criminals
Smdh!
Wonder how much she HATES AMERICA NOW?
She should of remained in prison!!
Putin was kidding when he said no LGBT propaganda in his country
Trump probably would've save her not trading her 🤷🏾‍♂️ just saying
Good to be an American
I wonder how much intel she brings back to the USA.
Is this person even worth it?   They contribute nothing.
Imagine trading a weapon trafficker for a basketball player...
Damn yall that hurt 🤣🤣🤧 lmao glad she free yall some crybabies! Come on home Bg! Hope you learned your lesson. I'm dying 🤣 all yall that hurt. It's gone be alright. Pick yall head up 🤧🤷🏽‍♂️
Wait, where's the US marine veteran that was being held?
So if they ever again say it’s about guns off the streets and saving lives remember this moment people….it’s always been about control.
Now every American citizen that travels to Russia is a target……. FJB!
Amen Lord I Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  If I had 10,0000 tongues it wouldn’t be enough to say  Thank you Lord 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Bad Deal, while a vet is still imprisoned. This was political optics only. And she disrespected America, how worthless.
I hope the has a newfound appreciation for our National Anthem!!!
How embarrassing for the United States.
In hockey this is called a hat trick. In a election year this is call 3 birds with one stone. Female, black and LGBTQ.
Makes me sick.
Notice who has someone waiting for them, i wonder who is actually an important person
This is STUPID.  He is a terrorist. Also there is still a US MARINE PAUL WHELAN in Russian prison on bulls hit charges. But no one cares
What a sad day in our American History initiated by a unpatriotic individual and a delusional president!
How many will lose their lives in the future because of this?
The same women that says she hates America. This was a great idea
Whelan was Trump’s deal to do.  Moron has no right to criticize Biden who got the impossible Griner release done during Ukraine 🇺🇦 War.  Anyone mad at Biden or this deal has to be a Putin / Trump lover. The art of impossible becoming possible is what Biden does while Trump the Traitor can only steal national secrets for Putin, Un, MSB or another highest bidder 😁😁😁😁
This is the most ridiculous thing ever and PROVES that this illegitimate administration hates America. Trading an international arms dealer & criminal for a mediocre basketball player who has REPEATEDLY maligned this country and expressed hatred for it? GDIAF
Every democrat voter and liberal you know is literally destroying your retirement and your children’s future.
Russians are like....  Dude... can u believe they actually made a trade
Don’t forget to friend each other on Facebook . 😂
OMG! Now she has to listen to the DISGUSTING Star Spangled Banner again...
And the people perish for lack of knowledge there of in other words it's right in your face and they just put it right in your face and what you going to do about it nothing how many of your uncles and his cousin nephews nieces are in jail behind the same bogus bull crap yet you do nothing you say nothing so you get nothing but pure misery and hell wow
Viktor is home. Brittney is home. I'm content, content, content.
Keep her!!! We don't want her!! She don't like the United States
If the Marine was black or gay I would bet a $100 against a donut hole he would have also been freed. Pedo-Joe is a POS.
If she was white or a military member Brandon would have let rot.  We deserve what's coming
Democrats for jail this is a disgrace this administration is worse than the taliban
So your telling me we traded a wnba player who openly hates their country who was arrested for breaking another countries laws, and we gave them a Russian arms dealer. Meanwhile we’ve got our Marine, Whealer stuck in prison there. We’ve effectively made the entire world a more dangerous place freeing an arms dealer likely to cause the death of hundreds if not thousands of innocent people whilst we get back some low tier athlete who despises her country. Despicable.
Unbelievable Joe😓🇺🇸
Absolutely the worst trade in human history!
The Saudi’s own Griner now, take her to the Middle East.
So our priorities are getting a basketball player who broke the law free instead of a Marine who risk his life for this country. Now the Merchant of Death is free on top of it. Smh.
I’m surprised she wanted to come back to the US after making disparaging remarks about life here. Also refused to stand for the National Anthem.
This was purposely delayed until the midterms were complete. Brandon is so transparent!
The merchant of death for the merchant of muff. This pathetic administration slaps patriotic Americans in the face on a daily basis.
Why would we swap anyone for her, let her sit and rot. Garbage
wow so they actually do it like that? thought that was just in movies.
He should be ashamed of himself
I'll give you a Roberto Clemente for a Thurman Munson.  You can tell how old I am.
When your skin color causes the President of the most powerful country on earth to trade war criminals for your release.....  But "mUh wHiTe pRiviLeGe"
Worst WNBA trade ever. 🤣
Hmmmmmm! 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Meanwhile we still have a soldier being held in Russia but I guess we prefer this privileged pothead over a hero.
The focal lessons is: Don't Do Drugs!
Awful trade. You should left her there. Majority of people don’t like her and we trade her for an arms dealer.
BOY! THAT WAS THE DEAL OF THE CENTURY THERE!?!
We'll Ukraine is about to get destroyed
Did they make her cut her Dreads??
So they traded "The Merchant of Death" for her. But not a U.S. Marine that's been locked up in a Russian prison for the last couple years? Well, I guess after letting 13 of his brothers die in Afghanistan he didnt wanna tarnish his reputation by doing the right thing for once...???
A Kneeler for a Dealer...
Should have left her there
I guess there’s no other POWs or people who served that they could trade for. High dollar athlete yep you can have your terrorist back no problem.
I was trying to figure out where he was.😅😅
I'm reading people's comments here and I don't get what they're bitching about. No, I'd prefer that corrupt arm's dealer stay in prison, but I assume that's who the Russians asked for. I'd make the trade and get that girl home. The whole basketball thing is totally irrelevant.  You were expecting anything decent coming out of Russia? The country's a cesspool of corruption, it's the closest thing to having a whole country run by the mafia. Everyone down below stays drunk enough they don't have to deal with the fact they live in a sh*thole. I'd take any of those poor countries in Africa over Russia. So I'm glad this girl is coming home! And to a great lot of the posters below, please stop trying to turn this country into a sh*thole country too. You need a sh*thole country to live in, they're all over. Go move to one.
BIDEN TRADED AN ILLEGAL ARMS DEALER FOR A USELESS,KNEELING, REBUKES AMERICA VALUE PERSON THAT HATES AMERICA BRINER ? REALLY BIDEN ?  Who lined Bidens pockets for this bologna trade , Putin himself I bet ... This is a definitive sign Biden needs to be admitted to a psyc ward ... right after he's investigated for pay offs ..  This is Un-American !
I believe Russia got the better deal in this. We got a basketball player and they got a weapon maker. After this, i don’t want to hear democrats pushing the gun law.
If she wasn't NBA she would be rotting in that prison for years and years ... Here is what money can do for you
Well Biden and his administration shows who's therefore. Because more votes for him doing it this way.
This is like if the chiefs traded Pat Mahomes for a 7th round pick
What happened to standing with Ukraine?
Fire our GM he’s so trash
The bots are out in these comment sections today
I was outraged at first but apparently, a trade between the marine and the warlord wasn’t even on the table due to Russias fraudulent charges against him
next time leave your drugs at home
What a disgrace
Why was they talking to an Arab after? In Russia? Did the Arabs help with the negotiation?
Every single move by the installed puppet makes is horrible for Americans!
Horrible
I think... LGBT identity politics is going too far.
A mad man for a loser… seems fair.
The art of deal, arm dealer vs drug dealer
America,  here come another Crack head fir you to deal with.
DISGUSTING
The US exchanged an arms dealer for someone that kneels for the National Anthem. Let’s Go Brandon
Why in the f*** would you trade a arms dealer for her when Russia is in a middle of a war??????? Swear this administration is tryna ruin America!
She better stand for our National Anthem.
These ratios give me hope.
Wait, why the hell was there a Saudi there?
Wtf
Wow I just found out they have a women’s basketball league
That ain Brittney Griner. That's a dude lol
A very sad day indeed. The Biden administration never misses an opportunity to embarrass the USA. Pathetic!
Was a fair trade, like when I as a kid growing up trading my Holo Clefairy for the clueless kids Holo Shadowless Charizard.
Omg
Too bad.  She deserves to stay in a Russian prison.
The marine was left behind for a person who hates America.
Damn. They cut all them dreads off.
FJB !!!! As a mother of a Marine this insult is almost personal  😡 When I see JB ….🤮🤮
This sucks.
So we traded a pot head tattooed lesbian basketball player for the most dangerous man in the world? At what point will you people realize that the Biden administration must be ELIMINATED!?!?!?!?!?
Britney like 7ft tall
Sad day in American history when they leave a military man in for 19 years, and get a basketball player out. And say they are going to work on getting him out. He should of got out first.
“Brittney” walks like a man…..
One of the most shameful moments in US history. We look so weak. Putin is laughing his butt off right now.
Disgusting.
Not to be put on the Wanted List , but We Seriously need Better government officials  and critical thinkers in those buildings and as Back uppers, this is a very very off balanced trade , what is a “famous person” to an Arms Dealer for a rival country that we’re in a proxy war against? 😹😹. God gotta be coming soon.
This all look staged hoax bs to me u doing a prisoner swap no handcuff everybody walking freely like a hollywood movie propaganda again hoax not buying it
She throws an inflatable ball into a hoop. Think of it objectively, she THROWS BALLS INTO A HOOP.
What A disgrace.
So Joe Biden traded a useless jock for a known terrorist and arm's dealer? Joe,you are a useless piece of $hit!!!!!
This is a joke. Now that she is back here and has a second opportunity in a free country let's see what she does with it .
We exchange a perfectly good human being for it?
Joe's going to be responsible for A LOT of deaths in Ukraine for letting this guy go, the merchant of death is going to be working for Russia the moment he lands there. For a WNBA "star." Talk about privilege. Fogle's been locked up in Russia for longer, for having PRESCRIBED medical marijuana, that was approved to travel with it (meaning he was ACTUALLY wrongfully detained), and this dementia filled, poor excuse of a president doesn't wanna get him back.
Amen🙏🏽 may the innocent all be freed!👊🏾👏🏾🦅
Black priviledge
Boooo
So what about the several million people in US prisons for minor drug offenses. Is anyone going to try to get them out or prison?
Lord of War 2 is gonna be lit!
Damn….. war criminal for a tall lady.  USA got hosed in this deal 😮
Hold up...the marine is still there??!! Wtf?! Wow. Democrats really do hate America, and this is just one more example
All y'all can shut up about gun control now. I can't take you seriously, especially when you release the most prolific arms dealer for a pothead basketball player.
Yet ANOTHER Brandon stain on America. Trade a terrorist/arms dealer for an Anti American POS athlete. What a deal. Right yp there with the brown clown's exchange for the traitor Bowie Berghdahl.
Disgusting....let her serve her prison time there
……… I can’t even pretend anymore 😪
This woman should stay locked up regardless. Why would we waste time on someone who hates this country and disrespects and he flag. It makes sense though all things evil and dumb this country is for
Nobody hugged Britney
bros traded a shooter for a SHOOTER💀💀💀
Lotta sick and clueless people in these comments.
Today America became the best country in the world to me. She showed us she will do whatever it takes to protect her citizens. USA, USA
How stupid is this A Terrorist exchange for an athlete  instead of a Military man which puts our country in danger by releasing a known terrorist. The Athlete chose to go and violate the law of another country. But yet a Military man is still there.  Unbelievable
Why did they edit the handshakes? Didn't wanna show Brittany shaking Viktors hand?
Obviously not BG🤣🤣
Pick the zero not the hero. Biden's America.
Well this tells you that russia owns us fr and made us look weak 😡
There is a lot of money in those duffel bags that’s for sure
Why was this edited ? Did Brittney and Viktor shake hands??
I better never get arrested for weed again .
Thank you for sending her home.
So demonrats want gun control but release the world's top illegal gun and arms seller back to the streets for a dyke celebrity.   If you still believe demonrats care about you plebs and will make your life better. Well you're a fuxking loser who should be institutionalized
So corrupt. FJB.
If u go to a different country leave your stupid drugs at home
I’m so happy they traded a war criminal for a junkie.
Wow.
Pathetic
What's with the guy in the desert dress?
Under Biden, USA is a joke, spineless and gets outsmarted by "terminally ill" Putin! Not to mention China's leader and N Korea"s leader! Wish Biden (not my president), had half the spine of Zelensky! Because of our spineless president, pretty much of the world laughs at us!!!!
Why isn’t anyone mentioning that this guy been in US jail for 15 years and most likely already told what he knows. It’s not like he was just caught and exchanged the next day . Comeon now , he was probably useless and using US tax money to be fed in prison .
Griner should've served out his 9 years. Pathetic that the US government gave up so much leverage for him
White Power and privilege is real and been around strong. WoW. Turned the half black woman into a lesbian dopefiend convict.
Worst trade since the Broncos Seahawks Russell Wilson deal.
What about all the people locked up in America for cannabis? This is messed up in a big way. They released a terrorist and arms dealer for an entitled cun+ who tried to sneak drugs in to one of the strictest countries in the world. What a disgusting trade. Shows how little Joe biden cares about America. I wish nothing but the worst for Britney.
They lookin back like "Stupid Americans" 🤦🏾‍♂️
She still hates America…she was inconvenienced too long. She should have served her sentence . Ugh
Great job woke America, Jesus christ what a bunch of suckers
Young people. DO NOT JOIN THIS NATIONS MILITARY ANYMORE. THERE ARE SOLDIERS STILL INCARCERATED OVERSEAS AND THEY FREED BRITNEY FOR FUTURE VOTES.
Cold war esque shi. Only way less cool
Absolutely pathetic. Joe Biden and his administration is a travesty and an embarrassment to this country. He will soon answer for all he has done in his 40+ years of screwing Americans out of their tax dollars!!!
Thank God! And Thank You President Biden🙏💙💙💙Welcome Home Britt! We need you back here helping to make this country a better place just as your ancestors would have wanted💙💙💙💙🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
🤮
Nobody can tell me that’s not a dude…
What about the others left behind for same crimes? We bring home a convicted domestic abuser, guess since shes lgbtq and an athlete she is privileged..the others were just men
Merchant of death arms dealer 10 years into a 25 year sentence traded for a celebrity who was sentenced 2 months ago for possession.... not looking good fellas
A Good ol fashion prison swap..😂 and they say we’re civilized..
It's a clone of griner
Biden you frikken moron
Good. Glory to Russia.
Thank God she is free
Brittney is a dude
Creepy Joe could have at least traded for Paul Whalen instead of that mouthy anti American POS Griner.
At this point the jokes write themselves
Dumbest thing our "president" has ever done
So I’m assuming I can go to another country, break the law and I know the U.S has my back? Pffft works for me. Lol
A basketball player over a Marine, disgraceful.  No man in his right mind is going to want to serve this country.
Russia controlling that pick swap like I thought they would 😂
Dude I'm glad she is out but for them to trade the lord of war for a basketball player is literally and utterly insane
This is an absolute travesty. We seriously traded "the merchant of death" for a basketball player who hates her own country and left an actual veteran there who was there long before her. You can't convince me that they couldn't have traded for Paul Whelan and left her there instead of the other way around, they just didn't want to deal with the backlash from social justice warriors.
What a bad deal... Brittney griner for The merchant of death wow
Why did they cut the part where the tall lady shakes Victor's hand ?
This is hella stupid. Who would free a terrorist in exchange for a basketball player dumb enough to get caught with marijuana in russia??? Seriously???
Documentary finna go hard 🔥
This isn't white privilege for anyone asking.
What a freaking disgrace.
What a terrible trade. Where is the solider? Why is he still locked up?
What's in the bags? 👀
The fact that he's actually chatting with his Russian escorts like they are best buds is crazy! Russia needed him and 🇺🇸 got ripped off
Ugh. Annoying
Disgusting
Russia got the best deal from this. I’m not racist but if Britney was white would any one care.  Black is the new white
Viktor walking out of there like well god damn would you believe it
Drug addict for a war criminal seems like a fair trade
That dude is 43. He looks 72 😂
Nobody but God
Now let’s see how fast she takes a knee…💩
Blink First Blinken pulls of the trade of the century.  Russia gets their "Dealer of Death" back, and we get an arrogant pot smoking America-hating mouthpiece of a human in exchange. Somehow it just doesn't feel like the world is a better place today than yesterday.
The next time that National Anthem is played you better stand your as up.
I wonder what was in those heavy duffel bags? Judging by the weight, it wasnt her luggage.
There is no way Brittany was born a female
This is insane, straight out of a movie 🎥
You swap an America Hating Trans person for a Russian arms dealer and leave a Marine "Paul Whelan" behind. That is a sad state of affairs.
Thank You Jesus HALLELUJAH!!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS B. GRINER😊♥️
Like a scene in a movie.
It’s not worth to have the monkey back
Putin took Biden to the woodshed on this deal
Russia is winning 🥇
What. 1 stupid basketball player for an arms dealer. That makes no sense. Since she loved Russia so much why get her out just because she got 9 yrs for narcotics. She knew the rules. The next thing our wonderful president will want to get Steven Segal to come back. He’s got charges waiting on him. Disgusting
Nobody hugged herhimtheythem
Just when I thought biden couldn't be any worse of a president.
Hey Britney,  Maybe show some appreciation for your country from now on. You can disagree with it, that’s your right, but show a little gratefulness from now on
Breaking news. Russian arms dealer killed in mysterious drone strike.
I can't ever imagine this coming back to bite us. 😩
This is not how i remember the scene in air force one going down.
Of course they edited out her shaking his hand?
Who was the commish of this league?
People are gonna die because of her
The most Dangerous Arms Dealer in the last 30 years for a overgrown Mid basketball player we got scammed
It is fitting I suppose that they exchanged the Merchant of Death for an  ugly Confused Woman who is dead inside.
Biden just agreed to return Vladimir Lenin for the long lost key to his miter box
Sodom and Gomorrah but we call it America today!
My cat could out maneuver Joe.
I hope they had a big bowl of weed ready for her when she got stateside
Wut a joke administration
What in Arab nation is going on?  Wish could see more interaction with Grimes. At least she is walking on her own unlike the Mr Warmbier unfortunately. That still bothers me. Could have been my son and Griner could be my daughter so it’s daunting either way.
People are acting as if it was Biden's choice of which US citizen would be exchanged.  Whelan is accused of espionage so it's a lot trickier. Of course the charges are BS but it wasn't either or
She'll be doing some grinding tonight....!!!!!
Whatever ... this is stupid on steroids.
Strange times
what about the others
Why they cut the video lol look like Grinder was going to shake the guys hand when she stepped in
Biden deserves impeachment over this.
Wtf
Remember guys the government consist of the elites & only cares for the elites. If it was any of us then we would be left to rot even if it was a staged crime
How a level 100 Barter skill looks like irl💀💀💀
It's  kind of funny that you're  mad at Biden and not at Trump. He has been in there for 4 years, where was Trump when he was the President. He did nothing to get that man out, and now Biden has to do everything to get him home, which i believe he will.
Lot of Americans angry to see a fellow citizens freed from a foreign country 👀     Ooooooh it’s because she’s black. Good ole American culture for you.
Look at the merchant of death walking away with the people that hugged him while he’s point a thumb back at the Americans probably talking his trash lol what a shame america ….
I hope the president releases all the prisoners in the United States that was also placed in prisons across the country for the same reasons.  There should be full pardons to all of them!  If not, it’s hypocrisy at its best.  Releasing an arms dealer who destroyed countless lives across the globe for a person that just had a roach?  Garbage of a president but who cares if the arms dealer goes back to its playground cause we don’t, we love our guns!
Wow, now we can own semi automatic weapons without being called as “sick people.”
One anti American pos for the merchant of death. Makes perfect sence if your a Dumacrat.
Now the merchant of death can go back to targeting u.s. military
I’m realizing nowadays it doesn’t matter your crime you just have to know people that are in the right place 😢
Welcome home.
We don’t want her back! Why would she want to come back? She hates America!
Keep in mind, arms dealers are only bad guys if they’re not American
Future victims of The Merchant Of Death salute you, Joe!
Best trade ever. Young, athletic, world-class athlete for old, been out of the biz for 15 years has-been that no one is gonna trust and whose no one needs anymore.
and a american marine is left behind cause the dims had to have their poster trans mutant back on the court-now russia gets back one of their best assissains-saddest day for america-sick
Disgusting
Putin is laughing so hard at Biden about now pee is running down his leg
DISGUSTING!!! Both are criminals and shouldn't have been exchanged. JOE BIDEN, WORST President EVER!!!!!
It’s like trading a Mercedes to a scooter. 😂
I would not trade a turd for ol britney granger
Yeah, but you haven't seen his jump shot.
Let’s go Brandon has so much more meaning
The basketball player sure has a court advantage .. can’t deny that
Was the trade made in Saudi Arabia or?
Bad trade if you ask a know body like me.
Russia will probably end that guys life soon. Theres a reason why America made that trade, other than Brittney. But I am glad she made it home. Im sure she is too.
Sickening
This makes the USA look soft af. Thanks Biden
While I'm glad one of ours is coming home, who we traded to do it I'll bet good money on will supply arms to those that want to actively hurt us and our interests. Compounded by the fact that Biden will push on with his anti 2A agenda despite releasing one of the most notorious arms dealers known.
Doesn't matter, all of you tgat are outraged will forget about it in 2 days and still vote blue. Fuckin morons, your whats wrong with this country.
One 6-8 Transformer in exchange for 81 million votes in 2024.
Are you serious?? This is Fing ridiculous!!! LETS GO BRANDON!!!!
Can't wait to see what she protests in America now
All the world is a stage and these are simply actors
What a joke.  This administration is useless
So ridiculous!!! Should have kept her
Save the Black lesbian doper but let the White guy stay in prison. What a crock of bullshit.
It’s ducking disgusting makes me sick
It should have been Paul coming home not her, 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Putin: Great to have you back Victor, we need all the help we can get on the front lines.
CLICK BATE
Bold move leaving comments on
It’s not showing me anything… black screen
Unbelievable!!!
Lol, everyone saying this is a "bad" trade...if it were you or a family member in Brittney's shoes, would you be making that same argument?  Also, this idea that an arms dealer is "worth" more than a basketball player, ummm no that's not clear or even true.  We can debate it, and that's an opinion, but I could play devil's advocate and say Brittney is WAY more valuable from a name recognition standpoint.  Who the hell knew the name Viktor Bout?  We're living in the social media age, everyone here is commenting on a public social media platform...and "influence" is power now.  So anyone claiming that this trade is somehow completely lopsided is sounding ignorant.
Pathetic. The degenerate should have served the full sentence.
I don't recall any white Americans being this upset when Donald Trump was sharing classified information with Russians in the White House.
Disgusting
If she wasn't a black lesbian, a trade like this would've never happened.  It's a sad day to witness such bias in America today.
People act like there aren’t war lords walking free right or weapon dealers in the country dealing military weapons.
Sickening
What is missing is we made a trade not for a athlete and criminal leaving a US SOLDIER In custody,  it is that we Made a trade for An Athlete who KNOWINGLY BROKE THE LAW IN RUSSIA,    for a known CRIMINAL who absolutely poses a threat AND THEN we ALSO left AN AMERICAN SOLDIER IN THEIR CUSTODY!! we showed the world the life of a guilty Athlete is more valuable than an AMERICAN SOLDIER!!! This is absolutely disgusting!!!
I’m surprised she didn’t take a knee and burn the American flag!
What a joke!!!
They'll make an exchange for her but they won't release any of the thousands of people in American prisons whose only crime was smoking weed.
0:19 even bro was suprised US agreed to it
Big win for Russia
woulda been funny if griner and bout shook hands lol "thanks for being available for exchange" "hey yeah you too"
Pathetic on the USA part... A Russian loyal to Russia traded by the USA for a spiteful spoiled privileged anti American...
Why is no one talking about why she got arrested??? Hello??! It's not ok to transport drugs between countries no matter how minimal it is laws are laws. I'm so sick and tired of Americans going to other countries thinking they can do whatever they want. Respect other people's cultures, and laws!
Disgusting what about the guy? She deserves nothing!
Should have LEFT that P.O.S American HATER in PRISON👎👎
Look how happy the Russians are to see they own people compared to America welcoming back a black woman 😂
Most wnba coverage ever
Which ones Brittney Griner?      Is it the big tall dude in the back ….         Give her back to them
White Americans will never be satisfied when something positive happens to an African American.
Here’s your arms dealer back…may we have our basketball player.
Wow... Britney looks just like a dude... ;)
What a travesty this is a joke! Karma will get her and the knuckleheads that got her released.
THANKS FOR FREEING A FELLOW AMERICAN 🎉
Silly American politicians
An will she face any charges here in the USA ???
One of the stupid exchange we traded someone who knowingly took a cannabis pen to a foreign country knowing its illegal and traded a person who's killed hundreds of innocent people and now she's free to cash inn on her documentary and the book deals the stupidity
lol no embrace for the Americans
Oh yeah…seems like a reasonable trade.
What politicians will do  to save there @@@. Poor move.Lost my vote.
Boooooo
But you left the US MARINE. This admin is absolutely vile.
Fake
Oh hey! It’s Yuri Orlov😂
Free brittany bish
Ridiculous!! Giving them a freaking disgusting criminal for a law breaker who knew she was breaking a foreign law. Our country is being led by total Commies and idiots.
Pathetic
*20k views only 156 likes* that ratio lol
Sickening absolutely sickening they exchange should have been for the American soldier not this cry baby whom thinks she’s better than anyone else she hate this country he fought for this country! Makes me sick I hope her treatment here is AWFUL!
Once again our president abandons war heroes for a black woman who hates her country And Trades them for a terrorist
You idiots in the comments thats not griner
About disgrace
WAY TO GO RUSSIA! WELCOME HOME VIKTOR! 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️
Liberals must be happy.
Ok, I've been on the fence about this but after watching that walk I am convinced brittany griner is a man.
Why is there a Saudi Greeting Griner ? I'm sure there is a lot more to this exchange. How much did this cost Tax payers?
Disgusting that pile of trash coming back to America.
Grinder's wife will be getting sausage for Christmas
Embarrassing
I'm so happy she's coming home that place would have been the end of her
At least we can watch some dude bounce an orange ball around now
WHAT ABOUT THE EX-MARINE; WHALEN, YOU MENTALLY CHALLENGED WHORE BIDEN!!!!
Thank God we got her back give her 3 months and she will be back spitting on the USA yea
Disgraceful.
I hope she learned her lesson. "Don't bring drugs in foreign countries" should be her new tattoo....
is more valuable to Russian a weapon trader
Anyone who thinks this is all there was to the trade, is crazy. Back room deals do happen in the government, too, people. 🙄🤦🏻‍♀️
They cut out the part where they shook hands 🤦🏾‍♂️
Despicable failure
Biden’s America
They paid her to do this so that man can be free
Yet people still support the party of the global elites, the party that continues to sell out American citizens.
Nasty hateful comments shame on on you know who you are.
A convicted arms dealer for a pothead ball player from a sport nobody watches...🤦‍♂
A arms dealer for a WNBA athlete.  Worst trade in sports history
I’m proud of America that’s showing that every American citizen is priceless, no matter what’s it’s cost they saved her life, you can’t imagine Russian prison it’s no life after, the hall on earth
Embarrassing
first wnba trade I’ve heard of
Big mistake Biden. An arms dealer responsible for multiple deaths for a basketball player
Am I the only one who doesn’t see a chick out there anywhere?
They were pretty happy to see him, gaff # 73 from the biden administration. Should should have been left to rot!
what an absolute joke. Ya screwed the pooch Joe. You left an american Vet over there for this america hating dipshit
DISGUSTING! THERE ARE OTHER AMERICAN CITIZENS STILL IMPRISONED IN RUSSIA!
This scene was straight outta the movie “Salt!”
Big L
This is a slap in the face to the US and it makes us look weak.
Ridiculous letting a thug like this man out to continue to sell arms to anyone he can
It’s baffling how many of you actually think this is a good trade.
The Saudis bought her... minor plot twist indeed.
Wow
Should have left her over there for good!!🤬🤬🤬🤬
Despicable. Impeach Biden. IMMEDIATELY
Now you know that lesbians are worth more than Marines.
Why does she want to come back to racist America a country she hates? No I don't say that because she is Black. There are far more White people who hate this country and I would say the same of them. There are thousands of places to live no one is forced to stay in America. Yet.
Britney Griner couldn’t even look anybody in the eyes because she knows it’s total bullshit … she’ll come home and start bashing the U.S like before with her privilege saying it should’ve been sooner , then continue too kneel for the anthem
A guy who thinks he's a girl in exchange for an arms dealer. Seems fair. thank God they left that Marine there though
I am sick to my stomach
Well there you are this administration will leave a soldier behind and bring home a drug dealer
This is stupid
Where'd the exchange happened? Saudi Arabia?
Man for a man
Lol we never wanted her/it back
What a FREAKING Joke
What about other US citizens in Russia prisons? Not popular enough?🤬
I wonder if she still hates the USA 🇺🇸
The installed dictatorship we have now didn’t help Whelen because he’s white. Democrats hate white people.
Also, why the swap was made in UAE...
This was the greatest trade ever….if you’re on day 12 of a meth binge
Freed a Marxist to "Save Democracy". GTFOH! Gonna be Impeached like Castillo.
This pathetic adminstration needs a ladder and still has to look up to see the bottom of the barrel.....buy hey, no more mean tweets.
BULLSHIT !!!!.. JOE BIDEN YOU SUCK
Vik looks good there.. he lost the weight.. he was chubby for a while..
What a joke this country is , shameful
"Britney or NO American". I guess, if Whelan was a Professional Athlete, he would have been home Years ago. A Slap in the Face to Everyone that Joe and Kamala gave Extended Sentences to over Weed. Do you all realize how many Expunged Votes you all Just Lost with this Preferential STUNT?
Joe gonna welcome her home
They need him back on the street so he can sell some of the weaponry that the US gave UK Raine.
Why did she immediately stop to talk with the arabic man. What investment did they plant in our nation again?
Nice we got our big weed woman back
So who’s the guy dressed in a white robe at the end?
The video skipped over when Griner shakes the hand of a Terrorist. Who edited it, Biden.
Horrible…what a disgusting trade…
Griner and Bergdahl deserved to be left where they were captured. She’ll be made out to be a “hero” just like every other joke in this country
The Merchant of Death thanks the US voters for voting for Biden.
WTF
In Pokémon terms, this is like trading a level 1 Pikachu for a level 100 Mewtwo 😂
Did Britney Griner have a male haircut?
What a terrible trade
Imagine she comes back to the states and retires....can't believe we released a known arms dealer for an athlete...I wonder if she'll ever think in the back of her head that people are gonna die because this guy was freed...probably not
Doesn't look like a "prisoner" exchange.  Suu friendly
Government employees including elected officials who do stupid things should face jail time or at the very least a civil trial which could result in forfeiture of all benefits they received from their job.
You have to be fking kidding!! Smfh America
High profile Americans will be targeted by other countries from now on if we have someone they want freed or something they want. Your regular blue collar American would still be locked up with ZERO media attention or effort put forth to get him/her released and that pisses me off.
Well done. So you have now allowed a man that has indirectly killing millions to be exchanged for a woman of colour instead of a man falsely accused of espionage who’s been in a Russian jail for 4 years. Biden you truly are a disgrace.
Wow. Like, it's lovely that's she's out and all but do you realize who we just let go? Because of an F'n careless lady and a vape pen. So keep feeling happy for her. Let's hope this Victor dude doesn't blow up someone in your circle. Because he is fantastic at what he does.
THIS Is what Privilege looks like. Wealth + Well-Connected. Any questions?
A lot of you are missing what’s actually happening here! Royal sheikh
It’s repulsive and asinine that she was released in exchange for a notorious ARMS DEALER. What’s more disappointing was the US news media, WNBA, Sports celeb and others cheering. Now, she will be on TV networks giving interviews, book deals, and product endorsement. GREAT job by the Biden Administration. 🤦🏽‍♂️🤬
What a waste trading a spy for a drug addict.
I’d rather them keep both
Crazy Country we are living in right now...
WHO CARES ABOUT SHREK? SHOULD BE SERVING FULL SENTENCE!!!
Notice they cut out the part where Griner and Bout shake hands
She shook his hand lmao
We brought home someone who had no respect for the US and left a man who fought for his country behind and you all think that's ok.  Definitely a screwed up set of values.  Exchange the druggy and leave the real American behind.  Shame on our government!  Who says it isn't about race????!!! LOL    Pandering at it's best!
I am a super progressive former US Marine.  I've voted consistently for Dems since 2000.  I've donated to many progressive causes.  This swap was wrong.  The US has now been put in a place where kidnapping Americans will be common.
I hope Britney has a terrible life from this day on.
WHERE'S HUNTER????
So now you see what America’s care level is for those who served our country…..garbage move on our part. Good for you Russia.
With every prisoner exchange I watched prisoner of Russia was coming home empty handed and the prisoner was going out of Russia had bags of stuff with them. Just a coincidence, you think???
The lord of war is free
That's a fair trade! Lol
I’m speechless
Terrible trade.
0:18 the way it’s edited it look like Brittany and Victor shook hands but it was edited out lol
Worst trade ever
You have got to be kidding me. Seriously, if you voted democrat, you should be ashamed of yourself! You’re complete idiots is who you are!
A basketball player on a league no one pays attention to. For an arms dealer? Not fair trade. Our countries security just went down for entertainment that no one cares about.
where are all those heroes with guns like in all american movies 😁
They should of left her
Wow the “Lord of war” , the “merchant of death” for a pothead. What a deal! But let’s leave a marine behind. The US is so weak.
She hates America why even bother!
About time!!!
We have a ex marine stuck there that made sacrifices for us and we give them a weapon’s dealers for her. Wow. America is just so great.
The most ridiculous exchange to date. Makes sense trading an arms dealer for a sports figure 🤔🙄
VILE
We could ah made a better trade than that commie.. lol
That's how the democrats roll
“This has been the worst trade deal in history”   -Orange man
Pathetic. Hope the people of Ukraine are ready for the merchant of death to come their way. It will happen now that biden let him go free for a pot head.
What a joke
Disgusting. Bad enough to let a Russian arms dealer go free, but to trade him for Britney Griner, the Anti-American American?! What has this world come to….
Nah this is bs, should have kept her there
This is just gross
Am I the only one that noticed the Russians hugging their comrade and no one hugging Brittany😳
Welcome home.   Arms are available now.
5 checks on why The Democrats love this release.  5 woke check boxes:  1) Brittney hates this country & the U.S. Flag - check; 2) Black - check; 3) Lesbian marriage -check; 4) A "woman" - check; and 5) a basketball "celebrity" - check.   And straight male white veteran Marine Paul Whelan?  He has NO check boxes for the Democrats, therefore Paul doesn't qualify.
I think an arms dealer is worth a gay b ball player, and a Marine
Disgusting
This dude got traded for an arms dealer over a Marine who served..
What a joke
SO HAPPY FOR HER🙏
This president is a disgrace
Total disgrace
F****** sad what a truly sad moment in history with negotiations in the current date and time in our years for 2022 Brittney griner is nowhere near a fair trade what about the other American who is a veteran who has been there for 4 years who did nothing wrong and he's still there obviously we forgot him but we have to trade a lesbian gay 6 foot 7 b**** who plays for the WNBA like she's so important and she tried to break the law and smuggle in some b******* little amount of weed which is very trifling to me but still how did we overlook the man who is a veteran for our country who has been there for years prior still rotting away what a sad day in history for America
Disgraceful
Yeah let’s trade for a basketball player and we give Russia “The Merchant of Death” back.
Laughing at us
And leave a Marine behind
Even he’s surprised, like wtf
The most disgusting thing I’ve ever witnessed
I thought the book The Art of the Deal was written by Donald Trump, but I guess it was Vladimir Putin!
Why are the Saudi’s involved 😮
Nice to know that the Marine couldn't get out but some chick who thinks she's a dude does ..........
Keep him.
brittney griner is such a dude lol
Maybe this Russian guy can now send Joe Biden a gift.      The head the Ukrainian president…
Just like in the movies.
Amazing how the hate-trolls feel the need to splew their garbage on every single Brittney Griner video. Get a life, you incels.
Why does Russia want him back so bad? Seems counter productive if the US is supposed to be against the war in Ukraine.
Disgusting
Worst trade deal in history
Maybe dont travel to Russia during an international conflict…and dont do it with drugs.
Hey Viktor!
Trading The Dealer Of Death for a rebellious, pot smoking, hooper that doesn’t even appreciate the country she comes from. Get some veterans that served our country out.
This is insane!
Did they cut all of her hair off? It almost looks like she has a bowl cut now.
Absolute steal of a trade for Russia
That was nice.
The way they exchanged the prisoners makes you forget their even criminals no cuffs or anything even get handshakes too😂
is that a man or a woman??😊
The U.S. has just displayed their weakness.
