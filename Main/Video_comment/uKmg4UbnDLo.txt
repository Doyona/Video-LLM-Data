I struggle so much when certain triggers like holidays or bdays 🥺been battling 45 years🥺
Having more difficult days than usual. This song brought me to tears because he sang from the heart. If you're reading this, pray for me. ❤
Its sad his wife divorced him over fucking up alot becoming famous.. temptations etc its a cold world sometimes but it always gets warmer.
Country night 🌙
I’m in2025
This song helps me get over my x fiance who thought being with guys online wasnt cheating
Harmony singer on this has a great voice too
Would Love to see him in concert.  But only RICH people or people that max out their credit cards can see him live.  What a shame.  But who in their right mind  ( Even Rich folk ) would spend that kind of  money just to see a concert.  It’s just insane !!!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
When My wife passed away unexpectedly, I could've went back to drinking but I knew I couldn't start again.

Keep staying sober Morgan 🎊 🎉 👏
Trying to get sober it's hard cuz I wasted on my ex like I gave him everything my soul 2 years later I'm still f***** up over it.
Love the high notes around the 2 minute mark. Amazing work Morgan!
I just realized that the first line of this song goes with the title. I don’t know what it’s supposed to mean but I’m wasted right now so🤷🏽‍♀️

This song never gets old, so true 👍
I wasted 10 years on a skank from Florida SMY ... all wasted,  good times were  my own  imagination, nothing was real. A total Con job. Reproductive coercion should be a crime
You don't do shit but love voice
Being bi racial and being from the most racist town for your white husband to beat,cheat and SUCK
Morgan wallen you have meanings to your music ❤

I let my guard down & let this man into my life & 6 weeks later he brakes up with me like he's 12 yrs old in a text ,BASTARD couldn't even call me ,I heard this song & it relates big time, I drive a chevy also !!
Do not sit around and wool gather. I gets you nowhere fast.

Sometimes the hard way is the only way to make it stick.

Definitely wasted to much h on mine😢
…
this song is everything when you're in this exact situation
If only he kept making country today and not what hes doing now
I feel this song
Good morning my love 💓
❤
Or at least one of your songs
Can i make a remix of this song
I think we've all felt these words. When the one you love the most destroys everything and leaves your heart in pieces.
One finds themself singing this song to themself. Once you realize the time you wasted on yourself.
Real talent, this song wakes something up inside i can't describe... but it's amazing and sad at the same time. Thanks, Mr. Morgan! ❤
After 7 years, my ex reached out to me, and we reconnected, but this time I was a new man. I gave my life to the Lord after we broke up the first time, and I completely changed my habits and beliefs. After she realized the new me and what I stand for, she cut me off for good after I tried telling her about Jesus and giving her a Bible.   I wanted to see the good in her, but in reality I believed God allowed me to reconnect with her to be a light to her, and to show me what I didn’t lose.  Wasn’t easy being ghosted and take advantage of, but I wouldn’t trade the new life I have with the Lord.  I thought I burned the bridge the first time, but now it’s for good and couldn’t be happier. Praise God for His mercy and love ❤️
Play
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
His music makes feel like it’s the 90’s and the world is still cool.

I love this version way better than the original recorded version.  Your vocals are better, the instruments have a better kind of sound, I love this.  Keep it going Morgan Wallen  ❤
💔💔💔😭😭😭😭🎵🎵😔😔🥺🥺
To anybody reading this, I pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better. May the dark thoughts, the overthinking, and the doubt exit your mind may clarity replace. 💖
Why doesn't anyone realize what they have until it's gone?
Amazing talent love it
Girl! You did that!!  Wish I'd seen this video 20 years ago. Could've saved a lot of heartache.
Im a recovering not needing anything but peace and privacy
Hey Justin why don't you take a walk of shame cuz it's over and done with... Remember Brad why do you think you ran into James
Why do you think one neighbor gave you a rocking chair.... In the other neighbor was snapping sticks.. and then the following neighbor go to this web page... Look at your boy go.... Don't hold on to these premeditated resentments... Show Justin I need you to stop... You don't want to smoke kid

But
Okay
Why does it sound so clean without the trap beat?!
Hell of a song.  Too bad he keeps getting hurt.  Dude get with Jesus ppl not gold diggers
I haven't listened to Morgan in like 3 months since my ex walked away. He showed me Morgan and it reminds me so much of him. Now I play this song and say to myself, "Wasted on you." I wasted almost 4 years to a man that I tried to show him the love he never got and I ended up the one who got screwed over while he lives with a woman he told me not to worry about and happily married. While I pick up the pieces he left. I still wish him the best but man did he leave me shattered.
*I did a COVER of this on my channel:)*
*Check out my COVER....Cheers*
💯🤍 HANDSOME 🧑🏼💪🏻🧠⚡❤️🔥

I like im the problem better
Im still drinking 😊
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂❤🎉🎉😅
Reminds me of Dale Earnhardt Sr.
He wrote this to an avoidant. I just know it.
This song cuts deep. I just got out of a relationship with a guy who was a narcissist. 3 years of my life wasted. Many lessons learned. I can breathe easily now. I can live and breathe now. He was an alcoholic which made it even worse. He thought he had me under his control. One day recently i packed everything up and left. I'm not the problem. I'm moving on with my life. He lost the best thing he ever  had. I have boundaries that i will not let anyone cross, ever again. I love and respect myself so much more now. My happiness is my priority. Cheers to me ❤
Good job God bless
Me❤
Peace to all those fighting for there lives. My sober brothers and sisters , and those in active addiction. I have myself locked away. I haven't slept in 5days. If it kills me, I can't do it anymore. We are not weak or broken. It's ok, I'm sure, to say u need help. My angels are w me. God's and demons alike, saying damn check this queen out.  I think I saw the devil bow his head and back up.
#1🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
The best live version of this song
This song has a lot of meaning to me. Recently I was just friendzoned by someone I loved for a while, idk why they lead me on, I took time to be with them, I spent money, and I feel like it’s my fault. And the “ya I swore this one would be different but my heart wouldn’t listen to my head and these boots on my feet” hits me hard, I thought she was different, I kept telling myself that, but my heart did not listen, I blame myself for it all tho, I just wish she didn’t lead me on so I wouldn’t look so dumb.
Timeless
Why does this always pop up when I'm missing my loved one?
Is Morgan Wallen and Jay Web the same person??lol.. I get confused between them
There is no good times without the bad ones.  I can only be thankful for them all. Aloha from Hawaii.

This song was me also. A total lost cause. I'm 62. I walked away from it all and forgave myself.  I think thats important for people to do.  I've been clean for 1 year  starting first week of June.  Never  going back
This song is really getting me thru a breakup that I tried to save. I wake up and this song just plays in my head all day long.
My favorite Alabaster Debris Shakespeare next to Eric Church.
Country pop music
One of my favorite songs
All of this time and all of this money!
God I pray for every hurting soul reading these comments, listening to this song. I pray for peace and healing.   After 20 years of addiction, losing so many friends and both parents to over doses and now 5 years clean, this song hits different. I can clearly remember feeling this type of pain and I don't wish it on anyone. Hang in there, if you are struggling with addiction please reach out. There is a better life. There is hope. I am living proof
Im 14 bout to be 15 seen way to much for my age done way to much for my age ive lost my friends my home these hills are cursed i just hope things turn out better for the future ive from Floyd county ky we have floods here every year ive nicknamed this ol coaltown to floodtown i mean it horrible how many times it flood over here you will rebuild then another takes that away everyoke i knoe has been affected by the floods

Mom I’m Hot; I’m going 6 times Platinum Mama how do I stop 🎶
Still love this song. This young man has an old soul ❤
I didn’t write this one at 16 years old .   I wrote this one in my 20’s alone at 2300 vista st. Philadelphia pa .   She was saying she was robbed and I wasn’t going to get the money for the music .   I told her I’d write another few songs and for her not to lose hope when I sung “Last one’s gone” by me sung by your voice and Chris brown .   My roommate was ignorant and sent my music out when he heard me singing it while walking in the house . He was my wanting to be agent who I told wouldn’t get a dollar for getting my movies writes stolen I had to go to war for .   I get all my rights after my 32nd birthday this June . Hopefully the sooner the better . And I’ll come to you and ask your record company how they recieved my music I sent to Jason aldean and Luke combs “Must’ve never met you .
Chevy Impreza?  Its a Subaru Impreza..

I gave my heart but it was wasted time…
Hi everyone
The intro sounds like friends in low places
TALENT ❤
I really love his songs but from what I've read, he probably needs to tap the brakes on some of his arrogance or attitude.. on something.. hell I don't know..Stars get a lot of s*** for stuff. They're just people but with fame comes a responsibility in a sense.
Love it

Love this song... It ended up as my am alarm after I slept on my phone one night, I'd never even heard of the guy but to my delight I woke up to him singing his dang heart out on my JBL Charge 5 the next morning... I love watching him perform this track, you can see that he really feels every note and every nuance every word is really heartbreakingly beautiful. What a masterpiece.

Someday some change I’ve learned it all you will have to wait and see if not a waist of a talent I will copy every voice I’m not scared I know I am alone for no reason and not valued is a mistake she may have everything and I no I have no money take away my power and I’m nothing to control my flaws and paint a picture that you want I can do the same also I made sure  was ok and that’s a fact to emberess me and ruin my image is cowardly thoughts
Clearly, wasted on some without much morals!

Every song of his has booze in it. Has he no imagination?
Thank you for Cheering me up Morgan. Your songs cheer me up
I would play this on repeat before I finally got up enough strength to leave him... I thank God everyday  <3 for helping me to walk away and not go back for the milionth time... Jesus heard conversations that I didnt... He knew about plans that would have been my downfall. But He would not allow someone I thought I loved sooo much, kill me. God told us to remember Lot's wife, for a reason.. Never look back, or you will turn to salt <3
💔💔♾️💔💔
Loving this!!! Thank you
First time listening to this song super 🔥🔥🔥
I'm still heart broken after 10 years she did me dirty . Ps. Love the music

As a 45-year-old war veteran, I’ve lost every relationship and failed at everything. One day, I was crying in bed and prayed to God. I told Him I had nothing to offer but my broken heart. He spoke to me, saying, “It’s okay to fall apart, I’ve got you.” Then He said, “I’ve got amazing things in store for you, just trust me.” 3 weeks later Seeing my life turn around for the good and God using  Teresa Janette Brock, who changed my life. After reading about her, I found her website and reached out. Her kindness led me to a business venture I never imagined I’d enjoy. Her guidance gave me a new sense of purpose and community. Now, I feel more fulfilled and happier than ever. This song and Teresa’s influence have been true blessings in my lifE!!

This hits when you’re not wasting anything on anyone but yourself sadly at the end of the day. How many times have you/I said we’d change and that it would be different. But it always takes the hard way for myself to learn even when I have people telling me to slow down..
Your mama
Such a beautiful melody.
does he only make country music? first time listening to his songs and so obsessed, literally downloading every bit of his songs.
As somebody who listens to Rap music this song has gotten me glued. 2024❤
I was with my boyfriend for 8 years he beat me most of the time that was a waste of  8 years of my life😢
It’s hard to believe that Im getting a divorce after 50 years of marriage, he walked out on me for another woman 15 years younger.
I love him I'm 7

These guys make it look effortless in the performance.  I lost oth of my rotator cuffs and it is near impossible to play for more than 47 min.  Thought about a slide.-
I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Ah, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault Yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinking 'bout all I've wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learning the hard way again That's why I've been Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you  (that lyrics to the song is amazing)

My Favorite Morgan Song
Just saw Morgan in concert… love him. He sounds even better live. Born and raised in the same place as Morgan, I love that he stays true to who he is and where he’s from.

I love you so much. I just have so much to say to you. Everything hurts when you're not happy anymore. Sadly I wont be able to hug you and tell you that i love. I miss the memories and everything that was in the past. As long as you can smile I guess. Looks like I'm learning the hard way again, alone. Just so much damage has been done, and all I did was be there stand by your side. Somehow it wasn't enough. I just hope one day you'll be able to open your eyes and realize that I'm free from your spell now.
This song tells a the truth I wasted 15 years on someone. That wasn't worth my time of day.😢
Girl lef me for nothing i hate wasting my time with people i like this song damn it hurts tho life goes on😅

I don't know what it is about this guy but his music moves me. It's like every song he's come out with lately is telling the story of my life right now with the man Im involved with. It's funny how a certain song or a even a single lyric can bring tears to your eyes. It's as if he's speaking right from my {his} heart.. we're different hearts, same heartbreak.
If he doesn't win a cmt award this year I know it is rigged he is literally the best ❤

This song is helping me , with an cheating ex baby dads relationship with someone in my family . Have it on repeat right now
Will never forget watching him at the shrimp and petroleum festival playing accordion 🪗 with Hank jr. ! My dad Harley played guitar 🎸 for several artists at that festival and It was always an honor to grow up around such great artists ❤
J adore je découvre cet artiste quelle voix 😻😻
Love your voice that drawl
Mój tata sprzedawał znakomitych niewolników!
I agree; we have to deal with life on life’s terms. I’ve been sober from drinking for nearly a month but due to heartbreaking issues with my boyfriend I’m tempted to indulge again. I can only pray to Jesus that things will change for the better for us since I’m also powerless with his moods that can really hurt me. My poor ol’ sweet & sour Johnny is a victim of Asperger’s syndrome which can cause him to say cruel & blunt things about any of my past or present flaws. He has a PhD. In organic chemistry along with many talents but has been relegating me as some senile ol’ fool who just can ‘t do anything right in his arrogant opinion. He has a history of binge drinking & we share some serious emotional issues. Inspite of all this crap I still love him so much & shall keep my faith in the good Lord & continue to attend church. God bless America & our freedom to make independent choices. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
me àñd my mom   love. sogs
Yes, I've been dealing with that alcahol thing, too, cause of my own choices. I could never blame someone else. I chose to deal with my problems this way. It seemed to numb me at first, but now it's too much! I learned the hard way. I made a poor choice and lost a guy I met after my ex of 26 years left me for a younger woman. I take responsibility for my actions. It's no one elses choice but my own, but this other guy I did everything for. I spent my money on him when I needed it the most and supported him when he was down. He stopped talking to me with no communication. Mind you, he is an alcaholic, too, so I know it's not that! I'm working on getting sober and finding that special someone who knows my worth!!! I wasted all of my time wasted on him! I am worth it!!!!
1:47 guitar?
Dude... I've seen him 4 times and drove to 4 states from NY to see him for 600+ every time, never gets old. He's the best country singer in decades.
Like 👍 👌 💛 😙 🥰 uuuuu but you are not going to make a great addition to the world in the world is the most beautiful things that ever happen in my office that you will
❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊🎉
Days turns into years. I'm 30 + years in a relationship and feel all has been wasted.
❤to my ex.wife 😢
I ❤❤ this song 🎵  let's go
My Brother loves Morgan so much❤.
Me and my husband used to always tell each other we would die for each other, instead of saying that we decided to say I will LIVE. We aren't going to drink our lives away anymore, our bodies need life. To all the recovering addicts, yall got this! ❤❤
I heard this song on the radio today. I am not a country guy, but this song is so great I can't stop listening to it. 💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
Let’s see if I can make up a good story to get some likes
This sound is so wonderful. The person who is reading this comment , i wish you great success , health, love and happiness !
This has stood a challenging period, I respect you so much #DrEbhariagbee, you have put together a life that I thought was lost, thank you so much for curing my genital herpes virus..
I relate this song from NEBRASKA to KANSAS to TEXAS to ALABAMA
#mine
Not sure how many ppl realize the double entendre to this song. For the longest time I was thinking he was just talking about the money and time he wastes. Wasn't til I went through my own hardships that I realized he's also talking about being high off of another person.
❤
Who is still here in 2024 🎉
I’ll never be able to trust a woman again she stole everything of mine money my photo id etc and now I’m homeless she just wanted to destroy me
To the one who's reading this, I hope you are doing alright, I hope that all the pain you are facing right now will turn into a great achievement. Always remember that God is always with us. He will bless, guide, and protect us.
It's pretty funny that Morgan Wallen is technically more successful than Taylor Swift and Drake this decade. He should be #1
When  you are drunk  🥴

How the hell did you cut this years ago and I missed it. I spend a lot of time listening to the old stuff. Beautiful song brah. I hope you won a Grammy for it.
Spent 8 years and a few thousand on a woman who didn't love me back. All those wasted trips to see her in Texas, gifts, dates. Wasted on her.  This song hits like a freight train now that it's over.
Who's just listening to this song over and over
Forever Awesome

This song is a great song!
Danger is what comes with selling your soul for fame then selling thecpeople an illusion to keep em down.

I love this song because it reminds me of my dad and right now he's in jail😪😭😥
Hadnt talked to her in a year, just to confrim I was nothing but an object who provided. The person I knew it truly gone. I hope she finds sobriety man.
❤❤❤❤❤ I love the song
Drink... fuck it
Our family just buried our best buddy of 13yrs a few weeks ago. Houston helped raise our 10y old and 7yr old kids, he was one of our family. He passed away in my arms. He was buried on his dog bed with a jar incuding treats, a note, and a piece of my sons carpet where he loved to scratch his back. One of the toughest days of my life. R.I.P Houson, our family will never forget you.
People who think he’s fine 👇🏻
I love song

I listen to this song over and over. I'm praying to understand it's time to let go for good. 6/24/24
John 3:16-17 “For God so loved the world he gave his only begotten Son so who so ever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him.” God bless everybody that is reading this prayers for you all and your family in Jesus Christ name amen 🙏

I agree with this song

Sober and who
This song is incredible 🥹🥹
This is one of my wife's last songs she sang before her passing in 2022. This picture is her. Rest in peace April.
If you call on the Lord the moment you feel that urge, He will help you.  I will pray for you.
I'm glad that he used a racial slur, it takes balls to speak your mind.  His songs are hits cause he tells it like it is.  He doesn't hold back, that is why he's great!!!  Like me, he was born free and he will die free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Country
🔥🔥🔥
I can sing this song without the lyrics that's how bad I've been hurt
I wish you all the best on your new workday. May your day be full of positivity, and may you find it easy to overcome every challenge. Have a great day at work.💖
As men we feel this but we gotta keep going,  ya there's pain but it's better without and we'll be better .
I want a shot of bourbon listing to this song. I learned the hard way and the easy way..look don't be to hard on yourself and take it easy
I was about ready to say “ah this is actually a pretty good song for being pop country and not stereotypical bro country,” but then he mentioned his “Chevy.” 😂 I mean the “bourbon” was strike one and forgivable. 😊
Played step daddy took her son in as my own kid gave them a place to stay always mad eme feel like I was at fault or I started problems come to find out months later she still had contact  with her bd and all her other exs making me look like a clown. Had the strength  to leave but now I'm drained out on love. Morgan and zach been keeping me strong and to stay pushing forward
❤❤❤
This song literally kept me going
You don't hear the lyrics until it's happening to you
The hardest thing is trying to find that one person that makes you feel as loved you love them...
I love your song
❤😂🎉😊I love yours song
Wasted on you, ho
Unreal song love it 👍

Morgan Wallen, you are my favourite singer you are my sister’s favourite singer to she has he was her background
"I don't always wake up in the morning and pour myself a strong one, but when I get lonely I do." 10 years sober ❤ learned the hard way plenty of times.
"All them days i spent wasted on you"  I dont listen to country, but this song is just 🔥
King 🤴 Queen 🤴 👑 👸
I don't always  Wake up in the morning Throw a chair off the roof of a hotel and get arrested and charged with three felonies
Great song.  Comment for the algorithm.
THANK YOU .....JESUS ABD MORGAN FOR THIS SONG ... NEEDED THIS LISTEN TO IT DAILY AS IM GOING THROUGH THIS SEASON ....😢😊❤
This forever my shit
*I don't do this no more because I realize I don't need too be overindulged in a partner of a woman woman needing sex favors because I know that jokes on me and you because our ual organs are completely perfect distance from our vision l👀k.* _L👁L_
I love my wife
Is song means a whole lot to me because it remembers me about my pass when I was a kid. My step Father had hurt me and God and bless me by letting me it's not my fault
Strong
This is you Kimberly masters.
This girl I liked was dating another guy and I got her a 20$ gift card for her birthday. Her bf was pissed and a friend said he heard he was going to fight me, so I asked her for her side and she ignored me on the whole situation.
I was in a relationship 1 year and 6 months and we were always happy smilling and laughing and had fights and misunderstanding but we endured and I even courted her for 8 months and she just left me and I wasted so much on her my money, time, love so so much love and drive her to school and drive return home were both in college different schools. And It really hurt so much that she just left and never a consistent girlfriend.
Beautiful song ever
Just got real today. I feel like this song was written to me, from me.
My whole life i’ve sober about this song 🎧
This guy proves that lyrics doesnt always have to be 18+ or videos with naked girls to have more views & followers. awesome lyrics & voice❤️
Here when he was Morgan walker
Km
😊😅
😊
M
Hey been sober 8 months just recently relapsed and am wondering if some one loves u and wants the best for u then why would they put anything in your path to derail u from sobriety if they truly loved u they would not do those things just wondering I really need an opinion on this before I let go from everything this life has taught me I’m bout to hit the edge without some support am I wrong😂
He fine
I lost a 8 year relationship and the pain is still there thank you Morgan for your music it help with the pain the tears will always be there but sometimes you just got to keep on keeping on
Time to get drunk
Sounds like every relationship I ever had. Morgan is great. I love listening to the lyrics of all his songs. They really match life in big ways. Keep it up Morgan. I love ur music ❤
She had left me last 20 years ago. That's why i am alone still.
❤❤❤❤❤
Morgan Wallen is the golden boy. Just another "justified" excuse😮👎 No matter what he does,  he could kill in cold blood and walk away... nothing sticks...privilege 😮
You're an amazing singer Morgan! Blessed. Keep God first! Love you man!❤
Drunk off of love, this song makes me feel sober.
I found thus song over a year ago when I was in a terrible relationship and now we are actually not together, I wish I left him sooner and now we are dealing with lawyers and custody....
155 days sober. Praise God
와 포스트말론에서 여기까지 왔다.......
Country has been putting out some hits lately
I think of my kids and being a single dad for 21 years now. 2 kids. Both moms are doin what they do. Lol I see how much I put in every day.  Yet... im the bad guy
Good tune as well as everything 😄💯😊👍❤️‍🩹😺😃😸😂🎉❤❤❤❤.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
The guy harmonizing with him is killing it!
Bittersweet ain't supposed to taste like this...was it the perfume or the lipstick, filing the papers I'll never forget, riding these waves of regret and something that Jesus said...
Thank god i didn't waste much time on youuuuu..
Шунчалар сокин❤
This is helping me to get through my struggles currently by learning things the hard way. Relationships do suck when you don't see how things are beforehand until true colors come out of the other person. It's harder when kids are involved. That's their doing and God plan at the end.
I love this song!!! Makes me think about how much I miss this crazy girl named Sarah!!! She was so much fun!!! But she was so crazy!!?? It’s not like I didn’t see it coming !!! lol!!! But it was the best fun I’ve had in 25 years!!!! I’m not saying that I would do it again!!! I probably would!!!! But as an adult you have to know when to stop!!!! I miss you cutie crazy Sara!!!! I hope you’re doing better and grew up!!! Your kids need you!!!! I truly tried my best to help her!!!!!💯✊💔💙☮️🛠👍🏻🤣
Throw them chairs my brotherman
All boils down to one person loving the other person way more than the other person loves you. Quite often the more you love the more someone else pulls away
😊😊😊😊😊😊
Marriage ain’t feeling like it should for about a year now, after 14 years and this song popped up on the radio has got me realizing it really wasn’t my fault. Morgan your words just hit different
Hi Morgan, you are such a great singer and I went to your concert in Hershey park. love you. You’re the best singer ever.
This guy is amazing
He looks like just like Kurt Cobain.  Holy shit.
I love this song so much and I’m going to cry because I love it so much (thank you for reading this)
Man.... 😢
I LOVE MORGAN WALLEN

Why is this not on Spotify?
I went to his concert on Saturday 5-4-2024 thats when i went
I hate country. . . This song made me love it
This song hits me every single time. Morgan Wallen you got me weak in my heart every time you sing this song.
I went to his concert was lit the last three days he was here in Nashville
I believe that somewhere in the world, there are people who feel the same emotions that I feel when I listen to masterpieces like this song.

Then what did the human trafficking hotline say the six times you contacted them?
Uses N word, but then plays buddy buddy to Durk. Hard to have any respect for someone who flips for the moment like this dude.
😊😊😊😊
people who are here in 2024👇👇👇
Dude is lit he is here in Nashville concert he rocked that s***
Yessssss!!!!!
I love this song ❤❤❤
Kimberly masters......waisted on you j.f.k
I’m love alcohol 🥃, a millionaire to a broke alcoholic, but I wouldn’t have if any other way, wasted a lot of time and energy on you!!! 😢 time for a drink!!!!!
I feel this in so many ways 🤣 thank God for song writing and no shame to keep it all real 😊
This song is my life...I've wasted 20 years of my life on a man...never again
You WILL get through this... I promise you.
I like this version more than the drums with the club kick
He was just released from prison
I am off the floor, a familar place, always has been. I don't have words to ease the pain. No body belives a word I say, especially about improving myself. My confidence is missing , not missed tho, been gone too long. I see the news and its me on TV, hwy shut down and its the wrong time to be me. Dead friends, and deadends. I made moms cry and dads too, 25 years later it's a bad time to be me. Wasted on you , my memory is wasted  But not enough. RIP everybody, too young to know so intimatly. RIP Sam, Jeremy, Hound, Shane (both of you) Oden , my parents and everybody else, see you soon.
I love Morgan Wallon
I hope you see this Morgan because no singer ever comes to my home city.but I really would love if you could go to Youngstown, Ohio
💯
2024 anyone?
De lo mejor que he escuchado en mucho tiempo....Gran cantante que he descubierto hace poco,  aquí en España no se conoce ❤
Hats off great job
Amazing song
Been 98% sober over the last 22 years...  Was sht slinging drunk 98% of the time the 22yrs before that.
Spring time is dangerous
This man made see how I was  wasted on someone no good 😢😢
Hits on many levels, loved and lost. Gained, advanced and crashed. Many relationships, and many heartbreaks thinking you're providing in full. Working you're ass off, to get by, but neglecting what I was born  and raised to do... have a better family and life than I had😢
All those lawn chairs i wasted on you😂
Im 38 so ill be sober by 39? I started drinking at 26 kinda late i guess😂😂
This shit sound so much better with a real drummer.
I don't like country, but I looooove this man's voice!!!!!!
Any tabs on this version?
I don't usually listen to country music,  but this song really hit me. Iv been listening to it none stop, it's too good. Keep it up!❤
🎉 ive almost 16 every day clean and sober is a blessed day
Awesome love ❤

Wasting😢
Me after hearing the news of him getting arrested:😂🤯🤯
Thank you Morgan wallern I love this song
Thank you for letting the song speak. So many singers don't these days.
He goes to Nashville bars and sings this song and starts throwing chairs. That's the new bar chair throwing challenge. Be sure to go to the bar tonight and start throwing chairs if you want to help this singer  It's called The Nashville bar chair throwing challenge.
So bitch ass what?????
This young man can sind  Nobody like him
Something about this song ❤️‍🩹 I can’t stop listening..
This song made me tears.
it just means he that much closer to finding the right one! Love this song❤
Satan attacking this guy
I love this
This and I fall apart by post Malone describe my love life unfortunately
Man. This song is exactly me and my ex. Wish I had done things and changed my life sooner
Thank you for making me believe in love 😻
I dedicate this song to the alcoholic I no longer will waste another moment on..all of this time, all of this money, all of the sorries I don't owe you, honey. He once said this was my song to him..he was right.
Had this song stuck in my head for a day.  Tried to look it up.  Thought the lyrics were "waiting on you" and it was a love ballad.  A few hours later (hundreds of country songs have 'waiting on you' in them) and I have realized my mistake which means I didn't waste that time at all unless I repeat it. I hope this helps someone.
Looks like I'm learnin' the Hard Way AGAIN
That INSTRUMENTAL+STRONG voice ❤️

This is one of the most powerful songs I have heard in years.  Headed toward 60 next year, And at this point can no longer understand what happen to this world.  May God be with me toward my end of life days.
Starting over yell i wish it was as easy
Went and looked at my ex’s Facebook and realized she’s been dating a different version of me for about a year now. We broke up 2 years Ago. I’ve been dating and breaking hearts and running around but I always thought about her and basically would torture myself over it. But I got sober and got back into better shape than when I met her , and now I feel free. Completely free. And I’m loving it and getting used to it. I finally was able to let go knowing she moved on. But the time I WASTED feeling sad and taking myself out of the race because of her, that I regret. And this song empowered me to me let go let god and feel great about myself
So good
🔥
Bro ,I'm going through shit with my baby momma,God knows I still love em, I repeat this jamm.rock on blues dogg .!!?

Lyrics  I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Ah, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault Yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinking 'bout all I've wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learning the hard way again That's why I've been Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you
this gives off an acoustic feel to it, and I love it
Going thru break up for 4 days now but I dont even feel the need to go back. Thanks Morgan❤

This girl Nicole Alejandra ❤ she just doesn't know how much i really did love her. When i met her at the liquor store i was working at, she was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen and Even know what we went through and how it ended i still love her and would go to the end of the world for her. I haven't seen or heard from her in almost two years we had certain songs on YouTube we listened to while living together this was one of them that reminded her of her at the time ex Mike Pearson man that guy hated me for taking his girl it was fucked up circumstances never the less i hope she reads this listening to this song one day like i know she will i miss you i still live in the same exact place
"All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey"  Fucking OUCH

I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Aw, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets to burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you  Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault Yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinkin' 'bout all  I've wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you  Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen To my head, and these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learning the hard way again That's why I've been  Wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you  Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you, wasted on you Wasted on you, wasted on you  Wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you, wasted on you Wasted on you

5 years in a relationship.... I loved her I sure did but tbh that fire burnt out... I tried to get ur on bored with me but she wouldn't amongst other things that happened.... I was destroyed inside even before it ended so Im sorry if I can't cry over u no more... after u saying sorry over and over again it finally meant nothing to me.... dang I tired so hard she would have been a good one..
Well Well Well ! Every generation we are blessed to have a new Elvis of modern times.
Damn, this song has helped me through some tough shit I swear.
Morgan Wallen your passionate music , intelligent songwriting transcends borders . You have fans all over the world 🌎. Love from Pakistan ❤️🇵🇰

Him and Theo Von gotta be related
This song is me and my dad. He left me when I was 8 years old and, to this day, he leaves me again whenever i start to trust him again...i still love him tho...
I just discovered this dude, best country ever man.
This song is the truth cause I wasted alot of time on my ex Katie woomer and come to find out she was not worth i sec of my time wasted
Kimberly masters.i don't  what to say except.....I love you.....j.f.k
Then how did the pastor who intends you to spot gateway issues' wife get blood cancer after I understood separate but equal stations if you need to unsanctify? After she got the bone cancer because I got 5 on it and you can buy dirt. Plus you have Covid and amniotic band syndrome.
No. #Heleadethme
Kimberly masters, this was the hardest thing I've ever had to go thru.its all my fault...but I still love you...jfk
Dudes' music jams BUT the nword.... now what to do
morgan ur prob not gonna see this but whenever i cant focus on my school work i listen too u a and it makes it easier love ur music😃
Music saves lives.
All this time wasted
You know who u are.......j.f.k
Repeat x infinity
Love his voice❤
I always want beer. Still hurting over the loss of loved ones. But I'm happy too. And it's something I enjoy.
Thank you Chef
I learn the hard way or die tryin'  😮l😊😅😢🎉
This songs have and will remain my best 💖. It only gets better with time.
Left me with nothing
Exactly how the fuck I fell
i dont ever wanna fall asleep again , she keeps on callin me just pretendin, shes in love with me oh just end it, let me rest in peace, and im a worthless peice of shit for a person, cant show emotion its not worth it , and i hate making friends ya it makes me nervous, and i hate being alone but i probably deserve it
I joy listening to your music. I was born and raised in the country and now my kids are raised by listening to country music as well. My husband will also listen to country music. We would love to move back to the country. Here in the city I hear a lot of rap music an I'm definitely not a fan of it so when I'm outside with my dog I play country music and my youngest will come out wearing his cowboy hat and dressed like a cowboy... so you can see that we are definitely country people...
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂❤❤❤
He didn't even say sorry for the beatings broken ribs brain bleed and midland shift of my brain but denied doing it and still does 💔
I've literally loved this week I love this music
nice songs 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
👏👏👏
Yup  my Chevy , just wasted , boo
I am still listening to this song in 2024!!! I love Morgan Wallen!!! Morgan Wallen is my favorite country singer!!! I think Morgan Wallen and Jelly Roll should make a song together!!!
I do love this song...
This song hits differently. We all have gone through something, and this song helps me and lots of others. Thank you, Morgan Wallen. I appreciate your music. Thank you once again!
Just broke up with a girl of over 3 years after a fight hoping to remain friends only for her to go psycho and threaten me with assault and  forging pics. And this is why good guys go bad 😢. Its a cruel world
❤❤❤
When you’re happy you enjoy the music, when you’re heartbroken you understand the lyrics.💖

I could've used this song a decade ago
I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Ah, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault Yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinking 'bout all I've wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learning the hard way again That's why I've been Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you

I wish I wasn't losing the love of my life. I wish he didn't mention money it meant nothing. Except memories that I wouldn't trade for anything!
Damn! All of these sorry's i don't owe you honey. I don't care what genre you're into this song stands the fuck out. That boy is gifted by GOD.
I'm just a fuckup and don't care. Good song
He’s showing his left hand and right hand. Tabs are not necessary.
This song got me swaying left to right
The next star is here
That background singer was killing it. He needs to have his own stuff, hopefully he does. Does anybody know him?
This damn video gets me every time. 😢
I'm an achoholic (however you spell it) bc of my hubby of 8 yrs. B4 him I dranked once or twice a year. I'm trying to do better for our almost 3yr old son but it's hard
goosebump overload man... musical perfection.
For real this goes to my ex.  18 years.   For what….    230,000 on my Chevy avalanche
This guy here has got me thru the last few months of a shit ass break up with my fiancee. Thought she loved me but that was just a lie.  Wtf.   U loved this woman unconditionally but that dont mean shit these days.
This is the best harmony between these two I've heard for this song, love it. Keep em coming Morgan 👍
New to country music this is by far my favorite
Ive been clean n sober goin on 8 years. But this song hits whether  im in it or not .. 😢 living that song RN and it sux. But  im not lettin "him" take my sobriety years from ne. He took enough.
call of duty!
That's one of the really awesome things I love living in South East Texas. I've seen so many of these guys  that wannna be him live . Omg amd all of the  tribute bands that actually sound wonderful, I'm more of a punk band person but I'll listen to anything loud
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩

I am going to drink today sadly. I found out the man I considered my soulmate was cheating on me up until 6 months ago.😢 He was telling women he was single, all the while claiming to love me and wanting to marry me.  And last night I get ahold of his phone and see pictures, lots of them, of naked women as well as of himself. Also messages saying he's single and talking very sexually about having sex, and actually hanging out with these women. And we're supposed to be married around the end of this month.😢 I am so heart broken, and really unsure of what to do. Not to mention that we've been separated for about 8 months, and he's been back home now for about two weeks, and had only had 30 second sex with me one time since he's been back, even though I've been begging him to have sex with me. I feel unloved, unattractive, unsure, used, taken advantage of, played for a fool, not to mention oh so much more horrible feelings. How do I handle this situation considering I'm very much in love with this man?? Help 😢 me please!!!😭😭
I used to think about my access in the song. Now it's strictly for my Drug habit alcohol waste it too much time
Pour me som morgan
Love morgan wallen music
This version of the song is 100x better without the trap drum beat that the album version has.
You are my favorite singer❤ and my favorite song is last night
Missing my Apple square help world it’s 321
I am currently going through a phase of crushing and wondering if they feel the same. This song really helps lift my anxiety about him! ilysm Morgan!! Such an inspirational song!
Makes two of us waisted all that time and money
you and bailey are the reasons i listen to country
so peasful
21 years, wasted on her
This song gave me the courage to get away from a toxic human being
A body mind and soul is seriously a terrible thing to be wasting
The MALE version of Taylor Swift.. with a touch of Whiskey😅  ❤
The first 4 seconds sound like the Josh hutcherson whistle.
I am a faithful believer, servant of God Amen .

Coco closing time

I remember the first time i hear this song i was in a bar in austin and when this song came on the whole bar went nuts..what an epic night
My song “Blue Mountain State” is better than this

My husband said to me today what song from Morgan would you play me to convert me into liking him, well of course it had to be wasted on you, he was actually humming along to it 😊
Waisted time again mf 😢
LOVE  IT ❤️ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Morgan wallen big fan from Oklahoma city so cool thanks for you my name is cheyanne Johnson 16 year old girl from Oklahoma city state university city state of the message from Oklahoma city so Mom and dad and sister and brother yes please 🙏
this is the ultimate tune for the middle class people that "had a grandfather that worked in the steel mill".
Who here in 2024
The truth hit different  no matter hip hop or country  morgan has got the truth.
When I'm constipated this song helps me go. Love Morgan's message he's spreading❤❤❤
5 MF in years 😢
Great song
Definitely know this feeling!!!!
Tony, why did you do me like that?
Love how so many people say “I’m not even a big country person but I love it” CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE GRADUATED UP TO THE REST OF US!! WELCOME TO A NEW LEVEL!!!
I love it so much
When you wind up with a "project" instead of a relationship & they leave once they think they no longer need you. All that you've wasted on them...
Morgan patriot 💪💪🇺🇸🇺🇸
I love my Booze....  I will never give up tell the end.  Quitter Quitter is a Quitter in my book.  Go to Rehab yo😅....  I hate quitters for life.  Man up Bro.  Put your big Man panties on for once in Life....
This one always always puts me in my feels
I’ve tonight broke my promise to never drink. I hate myself but keep strong. I got this. We got this together as a collection we owe it to ourselves to live our best lives. ❤
What a great song!
omg i have to tell u smething. i have a crush on u your sooooo hot. 🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵 like ahhh my favorite song by u is last night my favorite part in it is we break up and the rest of it. like your sooo cute even my sister thinks your cute.
I love booze n bitchez
I know this song's lyrics is about a breakup but somehow found meaning elsewhere, as I have wasted seven years of my time, money on drugs, alcohol, and nicotine, and I am coming out of all of my addictions now, no longer being a slave to pleasure but a slave to hard work, determination, and growth.
I suffer from a lot of mental illness's and every word explains how I feel.
Good song
Hey  sexy💜💜💜💜💜💜💜❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just heard this song on FM. And i search in youtube . Wasting on you is 1st search then couldn’t find it so i tried wasted on you then i finally found it.. i love the song.. makes me realize im broken hearted but i still with my partner 😅 i love the song . Thanks❤❤❤ God Bless
Decent song but the guy is a scumbag.
I love it 💖💖 Morgan you've done so much you're so good at singing
I love your songs so much lol you are the best singer love haylee I listen to your songs everyday ❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊
I was wasted on a girl for almost 5 years. Glad i got sober
Love this song!can’t get enough of your music .You are a. Great Artist!!😘🤗
As a recovered drug addict. This song is a favorite and go tooo. Single now and staying that way.
I hope your happy now
Hang in there
Just caught the love of my life cheating on me this shit was deep
I'm sure many will relate this to a spouse, but instantly hearing it reminds me of my struggle with alcohol, the relationships I lost, the life I wasted, the money I spent and the stupid choices I made. Two weeks makes 10 years of growth sober, but this song brings me back to that decade I wasted away.
I’ve been sober 13 hrs I heard this song and remembered how much fun I had drunk .. I’m drunk again thanks to this song 😂
Right here
Damn Boy...  You Rockin' That Mullet!! I'm Wasted On You!!  XOXO
I cried when I listened to this song on my Uber ride thought about My crush who hates me :(
He made me feel better because I was in a break up with my boyfriend
This is so good ❤
Good morning and good song  🎵
We love you❤❤❤
Gold, Gold, Gold . Man he can sing.
I am addicted and when I heard this song it reminded me of all the people I hurt that wanted nothing but the best for me
Protect this guy at all cost. I’m heavy on hip pop but you can’t resist this guy….he is just a blessing to the music world.
iloveto
Músicas gostosas de ouvir e um estilo encantador e suave. Sucesso sempre! Astro americano reluzente. 📣🎵👏👏👏💜
Snappppppeddddddddddddd
I just can’t stop wasting my time I keep coming back
I love this song!!!!!!!!!!!1
I love your songs I love your songs
I LOVE his voice sooooooooo much!!! I have to listen to him daily. This isn't my normal genre of music but he stole me away. Hope he comes to my town because I'm definitely going!!!
I can  relate to this song
I like this version so much better than the original.
😊😊😊
The guitar work is fabulous and of course Morgan has a great voice.
I'm not a fan of country music but I've never listened to a song so many times.
I am a big fan
Love this song!
Sit and rotate
Plc!!!!! Make a longer version of this my man pcl!!!!!!
Fuck yea !!!
This one hits a little too close to home for me! Sheesh! That's how you know it's from the heart. Characters change, but the story remains the same!
I'm a black man and always listen to hip hop but after listening to country music that's all I blast in my car, got white ppl clapping 👏as I pass by. Good work MrWallen
Sheeeeesh noice!
Went thru a breakup just as this came out. I know it by 💔 (broken) heart.
Been really struggling lately with my mental health, this song helped me zone out and forget things for a bit. God bless you Morgan 💯❤️🔥
My mom just left me because I couldn’t stop drinking because of my depression and everything and people looks at me like I’m a drunk attic so now I might be homeless 😢
Les pido perdón a todos los socios por las veces que les empeñe mi palabra

Love this song and video, do your thing Kyle & Morgan, ONE LOVE ❤️
I so absolutely feel every single word to this song. It’s happened to me more than once. I guess I’m a glutton for punishment
LOVE MORGAN WALLEN
Fent is my drug but I’m giving the power back to me today I been clean the last week in town for Christmas it’s been hard but I know the outcome if I don’t stop now death every time you touch it not knowing naw I’m good on that anymore
This song is hitting me so hard 😭 absolute truth
I don't know how it's even possible, but country music can make me kinda nostalgic for a world I've never been and never seen. It calms down and gives a feeling of infinity of time as if our life is not so short at all. It gives me meaning and desire to keep living through this difficult time
This brand of country is for dudes who want to listen to pop music but are afraid it’ll make them seem gay
Got you covered my love Queen 👑 king 👑👑 king 100 percent now
❤love❤you❤Morgan
I love this song!!
What a nice music!! Thank you very much for the gift
So Eugene Porter ends up becoming a singer after all 😉
I like this song
I love reading the comments
Wow this video sucks I should just stick to the audio
I finally gave my resentment to my last relationship to God, and what a beautiful time to do it forgiveness is one of the hardest things to do but one of the most beautiful
lost count how many times I had this on replay
I love his songs they help me deal with my life
Nothing but facts !
Lost my partner of 14 years song hits hard
Me ex showed me this song so I song it to her after we broke up😂
Just found this band and song, and im loving it. Great song!
I absolutely love this man. He is a legend. All his songs are absolute gold.
Yessss Morgan…love this song and you too baby!❤
Don't burn my stuff please I need it
No sting if you're pink. "oh death, where is your sting? Oh hell, where is your victory?"
She broke me down, not even broke me, shattered me! I was everything she couldve evwr needed yet for what reason beside me is enough to shatter mw into the tinest pieces you can barely see! I wanna drink so bad!! Yet i refuse! I need it!! I feel it!! Yet i refuse, because thats what she wants!! I wasted my life on her 19 years gone.
My ex
M
Love this song never gets old listen to it

Never really liked country growing up cause my mom played it a lot and just didn't like the sound but this song hit hard for some reason and country music has been growing on me rapidly this past year.😂
The only thing wrong with this song is how short it is
😢😢😢😢💔
An age-old mastery ❤ in an elegant display of character 🎉 ty
🥃 🥃 🥃  Why do I pick this kind.
Bro, how you let someone put hands on you and violate your space? i hope you got even with that person who took advantage

Man seriously though that back up was pulling his weight
How have I missed you?  Really great voice and talent, Love, hooked on a feeling.
Repeat ❤
Loving someone is never a waste of time.  Good song tho
13 years wasted. Left his wife and kids for his best friend’s fiancée.
Glad to hear real as it comes. Trashville music these days is garbage with a little broke back mountain thrown in.
Masterpiece🤭

[Lyrics] I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Ah, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you  Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault Yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinking 'bout all I've wasted on you  All of this time and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you  Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet  Looks like I'm learning the hard way again That's why I've been Wasted on you  All of this time, and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you  Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you  All of this time, and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you
Keep up the great work.  It's hard but so rewarding my brother.
I've wasted to much time on people who just needed me to better them for themselves with no interests in living me I'm so over love
Never forget the nightmare   that made you stop drinking. And no matter what kind of problems you have in life   you and God can get through them .
I just spent ten years on someone.  Completely wasted.  I'm an idiot.  Now I'm drunk all the time.  Probably going to die.
My fuckin groundhog day!
Feeling it now
I that on emy ex life me
Rehab is for quitters. Let them drop be a man Jesus this I’m a victim, it’s a disease candy ass culture. Let them drop and yes it’s going to hurt , you are going to suffer. It’s called growth this generation makes me sick so weak and pathetic
Love from 🇱🇰
Me and heroin

I want to marry country❤
I once had a girl. A girl that i thought was the love of my life. We had our good times, laughs, and hard times. We broke up about 5 months ago after a year long relationship. Went to prom with her, homecoming, i even lived with her and did my best for her. Im still trying to get over her. But in reality. Relationships hurt. God has a plan to help you grow through everything in life. It hurts. It really does but now days moving forward is the only option. Keep going. Make something of yourself and figure out life as you go
Devil dude this is what you made me waste my real good stuff that mattered exchanged for real fake nothing of sny good stuff that when it's all said and done nothing what you gave me was to me what ever mattered nope you investment was sponsored by and the rest fake man, love, make love the time you've put into it all was only the big investment always was evil intent to harm me destroy my life sadly your hidden agenda has been noticed and documented my life is in grave danger I've been fooled by your heart never in the right place towards any good you had towards me nobody listens and if so they don't care if I ever emagined but who ever emagines the worst if I could I'd still what ha ha hee hee trick, trap, set up, caught stuck in the traps deceitful betrayl of the deepest like that tree falling in the forest will anyone hear ya this Shantell Mitchell life is in danger from being played by a man who I realized 3 years later I've fallen in love with a gangstalker oh my God think I'm not okay
Why is the version on spotify different? Why??
I dedicated this song to my addiction.
Dam that boy got talent!
❤

All the days I spent wasted on a predator narcissist sociopath. I thought he had ptsd. Til his mask fell off. I saw the narcissist for who he is. The person I fell in love with never existed. Pure Evil
Love the love shown to the guitarist/back up vocalist in these vids. Very well deserved
I'm shocked that all these hip hop listeners like myself found something special in Wallen's music. Got to support and get his album and go to his show next time he is in Toronto
Fuck that sober shot boys we gettin lit
HES THE KING OF COUNTRY! KEEP IT UP MORGAN WALLEN!
💫
God damn it Morgan...
Dustin was cali a chihuahua. He had a pit cant handle it. had 4 kois cant handle it. Punk bitch dadday aint here to help you. Oh my nad that was personal.
Love your music awesome take care keep singing
I love u so much Morgan wallen
❤
I use tonsir in my cell while I was in prison. This is normally Mt type of music but u can't help to gravitate to it and how I can relate is really insane like this song was meant literally for me. He really captured real life this song is on my topn5 fav. Thank you
Beutifull song, my girlfriend loves it.
So fkn relatable... Straight wasted
I broke up with my girl friend just so i could send her this.
I didnt know he did this sing. I love it.
Couple months sober today❤ Thinking about so much that has happened in my life. 😢 Hanging on to my sobriety today and looking forward to tomorrow
Beautiful soulful
Redneck music
I love you
All this time and all of this money. Im wasted on you
@kevindurant5721 how do you do it bro I can't go a day without giving in please help me free myself from my struggle
damn
My absolute favorite song by him this song is so me my chevy has 445,000 after 27 years in a marriage that was constant affairs I thank God everyday he gave me the strength to finally say no more I am finally learning to love myself for the first time in a very long time
I wish this song was 20min long...... fucking love it!!! And Im a trap music person
You can do this. Hoping you have plenty of friends to talk to. I've been the fortunate one. Just don't have the taste for it. Always loved 1 cold beer..buy meds took care of that! It's all good. Take care 😊
Lust will Always destroy relationships! In the back of everyone's mind is like the old saying,  The grass is greenery on the other side! The problem is no one accepts love and their partner as your the one, stop looking for lust outside of the relationships
Lol respect our community. Pretty much *no you can't disagree or dislike with a personal opinion* XD just like everyone else's personal opinion if they do like it. Lol
Wow your the best!! I listen to you all the time. Keep it up brother!!
bitch left me and took the kid, I end up at the bar on kareokee night after 6 shots of jack my ass ends up singing this song to a bunch of cheers and found myself hugged up next to a beautiful brunette.... sure glad I memorized all wallens songs lol
And this is supposed to be COUNTRTY music?
I love you Morgan. I cried last night on the CMA AWARDS  that you didn't win anything you deserved it
Between addiction, love, and a codependent lock, this song is everything in the world to a young girl with kids who just wants love to be true..
How can i buy this version of Wasted On You?
Aswear this song is me 🎉
I can drink, I just chose not too. It's too expensive and my drink is Bombay Sapphire and tonic, so it's kinda pricey. I'd drink one now though, got all chores done and just bored...
Well, I'm drinking at noon on a Tuesday! Cheers
Congratulations keep it up it works I happened to fall back it nothing has changed good luck to you God bless
Hits deep on so many levels. Thank you 🙏🏼
I have sobered up 21 times and I am drinking to this song today
The man i love ..made a fool too many times..I cant stop doing what he sings about..!!
THE BEST SONGS ARE CHEVY SONGS  🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️👆🌏
I wasted mine on men
Bro more self deprecating
I love your voice.
Fuck alcohol man it’s the devil. You’re better !
Ever since Morgan featured in heartless I’ve loved Morgan’s music he the reason why I’m the person I am now thanks Morgan
I would love for him to sing a song I wrote. His words and emotions are so heartfelt. You can actually feel and relate to his songs. Just love him and his music.

High bloody 5 to the bloke doing the back-up and guitar. On yersel , lad🤗

I dont do country..but this song slaps❤
He got plenty of Sauce❤ Love him

Morgan should go on tour with Bailey Zimmerman
Best heard in long.. love from Sweden
Adam Sandler on Guitar. Gregory Nathan Bencaz on Keyboard.   Good Job!!!
Definitely feel his pain and soul on this song, made me realize more and converted me back into country music, tired of hip/hop sometimes lol.
🔥Love this tune 🎶
Damn Morgan Wallen you make me have a heart attack. Everytime I hear you 🧡🧡🧡🔥😭
I can relate to this song...
this made my eyes leak soo good
Good or you keep strong it hits me for the same reasons 💪 you should be proud straight up 😉
I love this song so much is my ringtone on my phone
Perfect break up song I'm going to be using this soon
really good song, it grabs your heart
I never used to like a lot of country coming from the UK unless my step dad played it then I heard Luke Combs, then this guy and oooooooowwwwweeeeee hack pud I fkn luvs it
Looking forward to songs when he's in love with his best friend 👍
Country music is the best music
I never came to a consert but i want to see you i will be there soon i no it so i want forget about this song
Was that you Aaron Wayne Verrette? That made the last comment. Congratulations
He's getting me thru a divorce
This song hits exactly where I am at now.  She said, in a calm voice, “I never wanted to get married to you.” But it explained a lot.  Eight years swirled down the drain.
Ok hear me out: Can we get Evanescence doing a cover of this?
❤❤❤❤
Thank you
I just sent this to someone I wasted my days on wish I could replace my days men r hard to find.
The lyrics are great.  So is MW.  I wanna know who the hot back up singer is 😅
Ive wasted soo many days being pushed around by my asshole brother. Id rather waste my days drunk
love his music so much!!#favorite country singer
Man I remember 2012-2015was all about Luke Bryan, then 2015-2020 Kane brown. Now Morgan has a choke hold on me with his music ❤ I still love me some Luke Bryan & Kane Brown.
Did anyone else notice that he made a song a couple of years ago called chasing you I wonder if this is about the same person😂😂😂😂
Three Days you wrote that practiced and produced that. You kicked there f***ing a** with that. Good Job. Lidget Talent!!!
I found this song... Almost by accident and is amazing
😂Banger in Sanger Tx!!
You are my favorite country singer ever.
Don't talk to me if you don't like morgan wallen.

Imagine he is singing about our beloved country and this song hits a totally different way. Take it back Americans
I'm not even a Democrat country music fan, but this song grips me. I've got it on repeat. Makes me feel something deepl
You just gained a country music fan. Hope I'm welcome. Song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I came out of rehabilitation and cried and drank again while listening to this song and remembered what is lost and gone with the wind.
这货的歌听了一年，有点像毛不易，周六要来了，可能会去看看
Try that in South Mississippi. That's why people don't act like that down here
The chills I'm getting
Ele é o cara!❤❤❤❤
Love this song! ❤❤❤
Working on being sober too
Morgan has a good idea!
You should hear my next door neighbour sing the shit out of this song
Don’t let anyone f with yu
I don’t drink anymore an this song makes me feel good about it.
I wasted 45 years on someone and it's over now. That's my PROMISE TO MY SELF.
This helps when I haven't had a movement in several days.
BANGER!!!!!! I’ll show my kids this song someday no doubt!
I love it 😊🥰😊🥰💟💜💙

His voice is so beautifully unique that's why I love his music
I would love to be setting beside him❤❤❤
Lyrics   I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Ah, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault Yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinking 'bout all I've wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learning the hard way again That's why I've been Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you

Might catch some heat for saying this. But his voice sounds like auto tune in a way but it's way better than auto tune. Make sense? Like the way he sings. Always loved his voice

I told you this was gonna be a #1 hit
Morgan bringing back great music!
“All of these miles on this Chevy Impreza” 😂
❤
Wasted on Who? Own it 1 day at a Time
I was really kind to this girl and she goes away for someone else for no reason our relationship was fine
This song made Morgan a Goat it could be for a female or achocol in 1😂
Love this song
this man helps me with my breaks up
He is so awesome
Congratulation s Kevin, been sober 285 days sober and clean
😢😢😢 I should have went with my gut when we 1st met instead, I gave you the benefit of a doubt... and had the best 3yrs of my life until your true feelings came out and you did me the same way you did everyone else. Yet, I still defend you b4 myself..
Memories flick through my head of the first carnival I went to with a girl..I hope she still listens to this and thinks of us. Sure we could talk for hours but nothing can repair what we had. All of the time, all of the money. She was worth it all.

I'm a huge country fan and have been for years and I'm pretty sure Morgan has been out for a few years and I'm just now starting to like him. Now. I can't get enough of his stuff. The guy is damn good

🥃
Eddie.... I keep saying your name over and over!
Don't consider them wasted just spent
Exactly, 8 years was wasted on you.
0:30  He’s Elite but Mr. George Strait is THE standard.
AlcoholWasntTheProblem iWas
Back listening this song, and still friking hurts, makes me mad and sad at the same time. It really sucks to love a person who doesn't love you back, or at least that's what it looks like. I don't regret putting miles on a vehicle, praying for that person, or doing anything I did for him, what I do regret is not listening to my heart when it was telling me not to put my eyes on him. Now I've wasted almost two years waiting for him to make a decision about us, to give himself a chance to love and to be loved, but after trying everything, I have made the decision to step away and pretend like "nothing" happened. Like I never met him before. 😔 It will be hard, but I think God's plan for me is different, is something else, is a test for me to learn something out of this, not sure what it is yet, but damn it hurt to figure it out 😔
This is the 2nd Morgan wallen song in a few months I can relate to.but this one is exactly what is happening to me after 10 years of marriage,but the last year and half of breakup and get back together. This time I feel the sting,the reality of it being over.😢 This song is my reality, unfortunately.😢😢
I can't even handle the emotion I feel 😢❤
Was introduced to this song the day I found out my now ex wife was cheating on me! This song helped me a lot!
beautiful
this song always puts a smile on my face, reminds me of putting my ex's stuff in the bond fire and making smores! still best smores i ever had. lol
He sing very sample  but he make to different outside  he is goooooooood thank s
How do you do things
Pure talent and creation.
Not to be a buzz kill or anything.  It this song i. The dangerous sessions. Compared to his new songs in whatever sessions he calls them. Arent shit. Compared to the raw emotion and feelings he puts into this song in his dangerous sessions. Maybe he needs to say the N word one more time and lose pretty much anything that will give him fame. Just so that he can connect to his music without pressure, like this. Without feeling the preasure of outside influances. Making him feeling like hes something more then what he teally is. Making him feeling  more discconected emotionally and making him feel like not wanting to put in the feels to the songs he sings in these sessions. To me. The N word is a shit fucking word. But if it brings him back to a point where he can feel like he can connect in these sessions with his songs. Without the preasure of outside forces. making him feel like hes something more then who he really is. Then tnsys whats got to happen.
I've always loved rap but this guy made me realize country was awesome music too.
Me too!  In recovery
To the retards who are struggling with alcohol and using this song for reasons to stay sober. He didn't talk about sobriety in this song. So plz have a drink and quit crying so much on an addiction you created. Damn I hate stupid ppl

I Like this song
All those days in a pew I spent wasting on you. This song got me through a divorce.
I listen to this song almost every day, that is how much i like it, this is one of my favorite songs.
I really love this song, definitely real meaning behind it.
If I knew how to make a YouTube video I could sing this song really really good I got that southern draw that's thick with rythem and I been playing the guitar since I was 4 that's 35 years now
I have sooo many " wasted on you, sorrys that I dont owe you" moments in my life.

A friend suggested I listen to this song, I gotta say it's beautiful
This is one of my favorite songs by Morgan. On repeat at least 3x per week
I'm not a country fan like that. But fuck Morgan Wallen making me a liar. His music speaks to me I'm a fan

You are the best country singer ever  ❤❤❤❤❤
I love this song ❤❤❤❤
Love this song❤
amazingly perfect and talented
I remember the first time I ever heard this song... Maybe if I had paid a little more attention to the lyrics I wouldn't be where I am today. Phuck you Shawn.
Watched this for twenty seconds and bingo, pick up trucks and bourbon. Is there any new country song out there that doesn't mention beer, pickups or girls? Nope!
Congratulations on your Sobriety,from Wilmington Nc pour myself strong Wasted on Who?
Been sober 8 years. I was a dedicated alcoholic, the kind that doesn’t miss a day or need an excuse to have a drink. Worked a high stress job, had a messed up personal life plus my body was physically a mess. Could drink a bottle of Vodka a day plus whatever else got thrown my way.  Then one day I met a girl, a very special girl. Things were going good, I was able to hide my drinking from her. Then one day it happened, I got super super messed up. I mean messed about 5 minutes from landing in jail. Called her up told Her which alley I was in, that’s all I remember. I woke up the next day in my bed. Butt naked all washed up but with a hangover from hell. She came in looked at me and said Ive done this once before and won’t do it again. This is your one chance. I love you but it happens again….I’m gone…..long story short I decided I could not risk losing her. Went cold Turkey never looked back, been happily married 5 years now. My wife saved my life and it was the easiest decision I’ve ever made. Stay strong brother, it’s a beautiful world out there with tons of people who love you.😬👍
This song grabs me by the feels. Goin thru a divorce. Sober now!! This song definitely came at a perfect time. Thanks Morgan

Literally died off the shit twice
240k plus miles on my Chevy wasted on her. Nothing seems to be “you proof” either.
I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Ah, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault Yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinking 'bout all I've wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learning the hard way again That's why I've been Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you
On repeat🔥🔥🔥🔥
This guy is a masterpiece......
❤❤❤
I'm fucking hammered
Feeling is mutual fuck wit i no ya watching have Bee for a lil while
That's a breakup waiting to happen...
Don't get me wrong...Morgan's voice is phenomenal.  But can we just take a moment to appreciate the beautiful range of the back-up vocalist?
Morgan you've made an absolutely perfect song again and you have a talent that the greatest musician would be proud to play all the way up with the speakers blowing!
This is a great song and I love the message thank you Morgan
This song can be so true  whew
Sober now miss you though nuno r.i.p morgan wallen was his favorite he was my uncle but he was more like my dad becuase i never had a dad
I was sober for 11 years and 3 years ago I started drinking again.  I like to think I keep it under wraps but there are times I'm lying to myself and I regret it.  I've tried to quit again several times to no avail.  I have been going to church and renewing my faith but still struggle with the drink.  I guess what im asking is for prayers thx
His music and voice hits the soul .he is 👌❤🎵😊
It reminds me of my ex and I wasted a lot of time and money but the most I wasted was my love not any more I left and now she is trying to get me back but I can't do it anymore
love this
My favorite song.  You is Alcohol 30yrs wasted on you.  15 mos sober dont give up life can be better.
This is my new favorite song I don't normally listen to country music but I like this
We end up "wasting" so much time on someone we love, we do anything to make them happy,  we put everything in and sacrifice everything until we dry out and have nothing else left to give. Until we realize we never got back anything in return. Love can be so difficult, but the question I always have is, what's God plan in these situations of pain, of getting to know people in our paths who don't deserve us.
9am on the dot drinking a beer and playing my favorite sad songs. It's gonna be a good bad day :D
In the name of Jesus I release you from the demon!!!
51 and no F given.
not a country song without a random line about a truck
Wasted on you baby 😢
Nkounk I’m lznshzzhfkjjmhmzk
Best Country Artist Right now i Think, well actually beside of Taylor Swift 🤪
@kevindurant5722 hope your still sober. My bf is in a world of trouble due to drinking, looks like he'll be in jail for at least a year, I havent seen him for 6 months as he lives in the USA and me the UK. Was supposed to be seeing him in 6 weeks. But he is still risking getting a longer sentence and not being able to even talk to me, by going to festivals  and getting drunk outside the home. Breaking his bail. He uses the excuse I cant help social drinking. Well stop going out and taking risks. My heart is breaking that going out and getting drunk is more important than me. He knows how I feel and I'm bearly sleeping or eating. I said its not just a social problem he says it is. Best of luck to you
Racist asshole
Keep that good fight !!!   RoseDuran
I was off the sauce for 14.5 years, but 25 seconds into this song I started taking shots of Jameson.
Yes sir ant that truth learned from it walk on
Donna I love this I hate this him but I liove you this tricks him
I listen to metal, but this single song makes me interested in exploring this artist more and delving into country. Perfect song
Damn when you slowly learn after so many years of hope
God bless you. Stay strong. 1 day at a time.
😍 wooow
I’m recovering from a Narcissist Monster who I finally booted out of my life, this song inspires me to to keep her gone for good. Addiction comes in many different forms and I pray that you never encounter a Narcissist Monster.
I'm also a heavy hip-hop listener, but this country song hits differently. Nobody talks about the importance of time. Time is the most valuable thing we have! I will never let another soul waste my time.
I wish ghost face killa was on the remix
Protect this guy at all cost. I’m heavy on hip pop but you can’t resist this guy….he is just a blessing to the music world.
My Nana says she wants to suck him dry
Trying to get sober but it’s so hard being from a abusive household and growing up n the bar with my dad at a young age .. wish me luck I need it 😔
I can relate to this song to my core.
This goes to all yall ex's 😮
Although I don't see the time I had with her as wasted time, if anything she wasted time on me, but this shit hurts
29 m alcoholic. I hate the control she has over me without realizing it. I guess that's my fault
Steel toe boots Morgan
Im in LOVE with this Song!
I needed to hear this. I poured into her for years. I gave everything I had to her and it was all for nothing.
WOW I love his voice 💞😍💞
I like this song 😅😅😅 👍😊
Absolute masterpiece 🙌

Damn Morgan, you keep cranking out the hits!!!  Love it!!!
1:51  this is my favourite part❤
I love country
"All of this time and all of this money,  All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey" Reminds me of my dad. He never deserved me as a daughter, never will.
Please stay strong. Alcohol is evil. Don't drink again
Great song
Women don’t want love..
My ex cheated on me 💔  this month I'm trying to keep strong I've in an out the dark tunnel someone that will understand me will be at the end of that tunnel one day

Love for Morgan Wallen from Pakistan 🇵🇰❤️. Thanks @sundaeconversation @calebpressely for introducing us to this incredible songwriter . Good music doesn't know any borders
Now THIS - this is shitty music
Get funked Logan Waggoner. I hope you know how much I hate you. And I pray you see this and know who it is. Btw, I heard about you and the baseball coach when you were in school. I should have known you were just a pretty garden tool. Good for nothing.
Just wow!!! What a wonderful Man to spread some great news..  real truth.. relatable...... amen

Wow Nice Party 🥳🎉 Party We do what we do
Fell in love with a man, and fell hard. He became my everything. I was willing to compromise and work with him, nearly a year of a relationship, just to find out he had been talking to someone else for about 3 to 4 months of our relationship
Brandie Nichole Dean
That pain in his face is so relatable
Me enoja que  personas malvados utilizan su foto, con malas intenciones 😢

I’m not a fan of country music but this song just hits different for me. Idk why
Good song
#My six time listening to this song!!! 🎶
song that hit me hard. damn it. "all the these sorries, i don't owe you honey"
So done wasting my time on this thing we call love😂😂😂😂
Prayers
My husband was an alcoholic and this song and our home burning down changed him. He's been slobber for 1 year and 5 months. I'm sorry we had to go through all of this to get him to realize alcohol does not solve your problems. We lost everything even my pets.
I just love his songs. Im even going to a concert.
😢😮
Repeating usually bothers me but I must make an exception for.....
Feeling this 😎❤️
This converted me to country music
Music is power and it heals the tough times that I have been through. TY. ❤
proud of you! i love you, stay strong. another day of sobriety. absolutely beautiful. ❤🎉😊
My wife's favorite song about me.

I love this song!!!  It's sad but it is a good song!!!  I love it!!  Thank you for singing it and sharing, got a feeling alot of people can identify with it!!!  Thanks a million, love it.  You have a graceful voice.  Thanks!!!
First time listening to this masterpiece from my girls uncle who introduced me to this song ❤ 💯
I am Latino Central America listening to that music I liked it,,,,
Started drinking at 11 because I lost my mom to cancer Christmas night when I was 9. Wasted away so many years drinking and ruining relationships with genuinely good woman that just wanted me better. This one just hits all sorts of feelings for me.
9 years wasted on you... feel this song like no other song at the moment
Someone did a damn good job on this one
Born in ‘67 been through it all with music and here I am 🙌
His voice😮 his hair😢
I'm going to say he is the new frank Sinatra..he is phenomenal thank you for your talent dude..love ya
So much wasted😢
Even the pop stations are playing this guy that's a tad unusual but testimony to how GOOD this guy is.  Great lyrics never hurt and he and his singing buddy are so damn good together.
But love this guy beasts my friend Donna y
I never like country
Hello my name is amandaparish, and I've been to heaven and I don't want you to go hell
I would love to hear you do a duet w/ Hillary Scott (Lady Antebellum / Lady A. ) sometime soon.
Song hits different 💯
i have been drinking for about 7 years non stop. i just recently stopped. no therapist AA nothing. of my own will. its possible. only a mind set. you can do it to. prioritize and do what right for you. it might not be today or tomorrow but i believe in you use that anger to your benifite.
Dan Bongino sent me,he said this is his favorite to listen to.
He's the best singer I've heard in a long time and this song reminds me of my marriage I had  before all this time and all this money I don't owe you honey.. not a damn thing  you're badass Morgan wallen just know that
I’m Cuban and I love country music so much. Strong feeling in this song…
I'm a alt emo Black girl in my 30s and this randomly my JAM!!! Heard it on Tik Tok and listen to it everyday.
Heart shattered, wasted on you.... All this time wasted on you.....I thought this would be different, my heart wouldnt listen to my head...❤Wasted on you! All of this time wasted on you...

Asked ChatGpt to write a happy ending verse for this. Haha it did pretty here was the output:   Regretful song with happy ending   User The following is a country song whose tone was originally somewhat regretful and sad. Given the following existing song, add 1 or more compatible verses which constitute a happy ending. Like maybe he realizes it was all worth it and that, in fact, none of it was truly wasted and now he realizes that.   Here is the song to which to add 1 or more verses or other sentences:  "I don’t always wake up in the mornin’ Pour myself a strong one Ah, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets burnin’ Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can’t keep leanin’ on you  Looks like I’m learnin’ the hard way again It’s all my fault Yeah, I dropped the ball You’re gone and I’m gone three sheets to the wind Thinking ’bout all I’ve wasted on you  All of this time and all of this money All of these sorries I don’t owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you  Yeah, I swore this one’d be different My heart wouldn’t listen to my head and these boots on my feet  Looks like I’m learning the hard way again That’s why I’ve been Wasted on you  All of this time, and all of this money All of these sorries I don’t owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you  Like this pile of your stuff that’s packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you  All of this time, and all of this money All of these sorries I don’t owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you"  ChatGPT I don’t always wake up in the mornin’ Pour myself a strong one Ah, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets burnin’ Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can’t keep leanin’ on you  Looks like I’m learnin’ the hard way again It’s all my fault Yeah, I dropped the ball You’re gone and I’m gone three sheets to the wind Thinking ’bout all I’ve wasted on you  All of this time and all of this money All of these sorries I don’t owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you  Yeah, I swore this one’d be different My heart wouldn’t listen to my head and these boots on my feet  Looks like I’m learning the hard way again That’s why I’ve been Wasted on you  All of this time, and all of this money All of these sorries I don’t owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you  But now I'm standing at a crossroad sign The weight of the past lifting from my mind I see a new dawn breaking through And I'm realizing it wasn't all in vain The lessons I learned, the strength I gained Every moment led me closer to the truth  So, goodbye to the wasted nights and tears Hello to a future with no regrets or fears I'm leaving behind what I thought was true Because none of it was truly wasted on you  All of this time, and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew Led me to a love that's pure and true No longer wasted on you  Like this pile of your stuff that’s packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you  All of this time, and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you  Now I'm walking down a brand new road Leaving behind the heavy load And I'm grateful for the lessons I've been through Because none of it was truly wasted on you
Keep singing it brother! Helps me every time I listen to from going back to an abusive situation....
He great
My mom loves you Morgan Wallen for real😊
Man, he is feeling this song. Whoever she was… gheezzz…
This is my song to drugs
I'm your biggest fan!!!
YOu're the best
I love the lyrics to this song it has a powerful meaning wasted on too many people that didn’t want my heart.
Formula country is so so uninteresting.
Im a Morgan Wallen fan 200% . He can do no wrong in my ❤. His music has helped me try and come to grips with the murder of my 34 yr old firstborn and only daughter. God i miss her every second and his songs , his voice they heal my soul my mind and my heart and i thank God for how his songs reach inside me and they ease my heartache.❤
Best song ever
Your a loser

Looks like I'm learning the hard way again
❤CARTOON ... SHAGGY ❤
❤Drinking #1 for YOU #2 Your CHEAP #3 MILES ON HONDA ❤
I love this song! I feel like this my marriage 23 😢
Awesome lyrics 🥂
Me and my painful divorce after 17 years of marriage. I'm in a better place now but it still hurts. I play this song to work through the pain.
Women that do you like that are made for the streets.
She gone 27 years later
God, I love this song. I love Morgan's music
Smooth as a gravy sammich
Sorry yall did not to bother video i had no clue again truly ❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊😊
This is to good you are the best of the best❤
I don’t care whether this is a hot take or not; this is in my opinion Morgan Wallens’ best song
If someone asks you what good music is show them this.
This is one of those songs that most of us can relate to at some point in our lives
This is helping me with a breakup ..I love him but I can't let this go on .. Sincerely  Brenda Kraus
I told a hot goth girl, if i showed her a country song she liked, she has to let me take her to dinner.  I asked her where she wants to go before I even sent it 😂
This is bullshit…. Snap track…. Pop
Me with opiates , wasted everything for a high
Everyone remembering their ex and cursing them 😂
I’m a drunk who lost my family but I’m trying now…
I can relate! It sucks when you invest so much time into it! But I'm done with doing it "again and again"
Yes he is awesome
Lyrics:  I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Ah, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault Yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinking 'bout all I've wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learning the hard way again That's why I've been Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money  All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money  All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you  Wasted on you Wasted on you  Wasted on you
I Hurd this song for the first time today😢 I was helping my husband of 13 years  find his phone so I called it and this was the ring tone he had set for me.
cody you have an amazing voice and style! Merle Haggard is my favorite, you are right there with him. Dont ever change. God bless you!
Just sounds pretty.Absolutelly great.
100% Born for the grab your heart strings Dept of Country Music! It’s a no brainer….. it be un American not to like this guy!
All of these sorry's I don't owe you honey....man smh I'd say sorry if I called her out about something and she got mad because she couldn't explain..love you so much I thought it was my fault. 😢
But when I get lonely I do
Stanking bout all I've wasted on you
I don’t have anybody I miss or still think about, but I love this song and I hope the people in my city do too because I won’t stop blasting this on the way to the store any time soon 🤭
Beautiful.  I love this song.
WOW! Why am I so late to the party? What a great, great song.
Its funny now (wasn't back then) but a lot of your songs on this album really take me back to what I was going through over 30 years ago.
Same here lady see I could be there making real money
The very beginning of this song sounds like the very beginning to friends in low places
How, could, I feel so lonesome ,,I made , IT ,,I want to see you ,.I only have 100..k.but,I want to do what, I I want to do ,, my kids are smart. ,, I'm going to travel ..
2:01
I am also a recovering alcoholic and addict... I was also playing this song this morning bc I relate it to my addiction also... I didn't know others felt the same way so thank you so much for sharing... We got this one day at a time...
God Don’t love quilters!!! ROLL TIDE!!!
Love you morgan

Absolutely love this song
Stay sober and safe travels keep it up I'm still trying 💗🙏
Exactly what's wrong with Nashville. 🚮
Amen!
One of the only real country singers out there

When it comes to love nothing is waisted
I❤You Morgan!

Ive been sober for 5 months after drinking every day since I was 12 I got bad and started forgetting about the few good things in my life that I have my wife and my kids help me through it daily
Lyrics. Enjoy   I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Ah, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault Yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinking 'bout all I've wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learning the hard way again That's why I've been Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you

Just discovered this beautiful song
Looks like I’m learning the hard way again 😢
I hate country music but this is art
There are so many songs that make me nod my head and hum along to the melody. So many that just make life better and more tolerable.  This is NOT one of them.😂
Definitely has a killer voice
Best song. Acoustic version
7yrs gone.. tossed me away as soon as we got our first home together. All because he wanted to throw hands, and I defended myself.. 😢
Been having this song on replay for the past week
Morgan Wallen is getting me through this very hard break up I've been having, I can't stop feeling this type of pain but his music says exactly what I'm feeling at this moment.
Music for the soul
Bro sounds like he owns slaves
Stay strong for all recovery addicts.  This song has brought me to tears
Hey Mr Morgan wallen I love your videos and I love you my friend
❤🤠🎤🎸 good luck
I listen to this everyday and just cry..
This is ,me this is just stunning ❤❤
Rock n roll returns in the perfect time
Hey I’m your biggest fan
❤
Going through the motions of a 12 year break up and this hits home hard 🥲
My best friend showed me this song. The next thing I know I had to stopped being her friend due to issues and this song can absolutely relate of what I did for her..
Everyone over Here where I live listen Morgan for pretty much anything
This song is so helpful to me
I've got a drinking problem....2 hands and only 1 mouth.
Morgan Is My Fav I Will Die To See Him

Not a Country person.   But maybe now I am 😂 This is F'in good
Can we all just agree this number 1 for the next 5 years at the least i don't know another song that can mean so many different things that relate to so many different people
This is a very good song 🎵 👌 👏. Because to me it represents me for wasting my time on love  and time for love 😔😔😔

Dear Drugs: (plays this song) #492DaysClean
Findings out you're just a backup husband will bring to this song.
Just left a 179 year marriage 15 minutes ago. My wife was cheating on me with her brother and it's been tough. This song really got me through it. Now I'm just hoping for likes and support from simps in this comment section. Please pray for me. Also my dog is dying and I think i have gain green in my right toe. But again this song surely will cure it all. Going to seek attention now on other videos, godspeed.
hi
Wooo that was so good
i thought he said chevy impreza
7 years of bending ever moral I had to accommodate someone without any morals.
Feel this song so much, minus getting up in the morning to drink!  I cannot drink early in the morning. But feel the rest of this song!❤
0:50 I love the money signal 😊

I’m a recovering meth addict.  Current on opioids to come off meth.  I was prostituting to support my habit before rehab.   This song makes me want to take it.

Thanks to him I listen to country music now
For some reason he reminds me of Jackson Browne, not the voice but the source of his material or maybe it's when he plays the piano...lol
This song is helping me get through a break up of my relationship of 7 years

Thanks man
Read a lot of heartfelt comments, but why is noone adressing this man´s glorious mullet?
This song honestly gets me. I feel the words so much. Not to someone else but to myself. Its like i spend all this time, money, prayers and all of it is wasted. Nothing hurts more than the damage i do myself.
I wish accent music could actually be sung by DUI guy.
Love it
A certain someone makes me wanna
I guess he effed around and missed a concert.  Good job super star
I feel this song
This song.... 💔  was cheated on after 15yr marriage, then lost the next Lady I still love, to a long distance relationship and recently moved , met an absolute angel and realized I can care and actually love again.. ❤
To the woman I've loved over 2 1/2 years but I finally  get to hold her tight and kiss forever fri
I dedicate this song to you Andrea Hicks, you put me thru hell and I survived and I don't know where you are, but I'm glad it's not with me....
All the time I spent wasted on you (fentanyl) Almost 5 months clean
Yeah
This goes out to my old love …. Last Fortress. GFY
Shot of water to that!!!!!?
❤❤❤❤
Awesome songs man
Just drink on your anniversary date and that’s it🎉
Me learning the hard way again. My fault I can't stop drinking it's impossible.
Beauty
Good job
I prefer this over the studio version any day ... give me the raw and untouched emotions I want the tears riding these emotions not the mechanics broard
Thank you for your comment on my comment on this song amber to Morgan wallen
Im a alcoholic myself.. I know how this song feels so good to certain people... God bless.. keep your head up 💪
Golden
He's helped me deal with a broken heart.
It’s always the “other” person in the comments that’s the victim. Pretty sure a lot of you are the ones that wasted others time 😂
this song makes me start drinking befor ten o clock am
I love when country meets rap.. still love tim Mcgraw and Nelly
Father saids he loves you
https://youtu.be/_1aO4pCvxN0
I love you mn
My girlfriend showed me this song 🎶 it’s nice
Hi Kevin durant
This song means so much to me in so many ways
Recently changed my life for the better. All the money blown up my nose. Always thought to myself " looks like im learning the hard way again" he says it perfectly and the song really hits home
I love this song!!! I keep replaying it over and over🙂
🔥🔥🔥🔥
When I get lonely, I do.
I'm a city boy & always listened to rap , but this guy converted me 💯 I love this kind music now ! the reactions I get pulling up on the block 😂
Love this song by Morgan wallen from your favorite fan amber ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤i will never ever stop listening to your self 💕💕💕💕💕
i just got out of a 5 year relationship and this song helps me so much with the positive side of life thanks morgan i drink a bourbon for you 🍻
@Kevin Durant I'm very proud of you. We DO recover. #33yearssober
I’ve never liked country music but jus hearing his voice makes me wanna listen he really got it
Indigenous focused mental health and addictions diploma grad here; The relationship between alcohol and country music has always been strong, but this man fucking nailed it. The fact he’s a millionaire is just a bonus. It’s very clear this man has turned one of his weaknesses into remarkable coping strategy, helping heal himself, and thousands (conservatively) if not millions of others. Encore, I absolutely love this guy
🎉 5 months sober today from alcohol.
👏
Love your song❤
Thank God for un answered prayers. What a awesome tune ✌️✌️✌️
I was sober 11 years. U know what happened....... I turned 12
I love yours music
I feel like I wasted 8 years loving a woman that just decided she was tired of me one day and dumped me like yesterdays trash. I know it's not true though. I have a beautiful 7 year old daughter that's proof none of that love was wasted. Still feeling this song though.
Just found out my mate been having an affair...thought I was crazy and symptomatic again...had ro learn from her, that he was having another relationship while coming home to me...been drinking nightly....starting to understand that I'm not in control and I can't fix it, that my jaw aint made of glass, and that I'm going to be okay no matter what. This song has helped me to not feel so alone...and inspired me ro write my own music and to put the bottle down...all those days wasted on you...
I wasted 20 years on Someone 10 years ago or so and today I’m giving back all those sorrows to Universe and enjoying what time I got left on myself and daughters 🙏💙
I love this song every munch
❤
God Bless everyone!! Stay in prayer. THE KING OF THE UNIVERSE COMING SOON...MORGAN WRITE A SONG ABOUT THE WAY THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE JESUS CHRIST!!!!
You morgan wallen
This song has many meanings !!! Absolutely love it ! Never get tired of listening to it !!!!!!!! ❤😢
I’m not perfect but tried to fix my marriage of 20 years even though I caught her cheating. I still love her with all my heart even though she gave up on us. This song hits home hard.
His song to Anheuser Busch
So much love to you, your voice ♥ so so beautiful ❤
Morgan .. you out did yourself again buddy !  HIT 🎶🔥 ATX 512 jammin 🎶
Good morning to Morgan enjoy your day ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I keep watching this session. So Amazinggggggg
Love him too❤❤❤❤
Morgan wallen is the best country music singer forever and always
As a kid I hated country. Couldn’t stand it, but as I got older and went through heat break after heart break, country has grown on me. I still have my preferred music over country but it definitely has a spot on my playlist.
I never knew I'd like country music. You're awesome man.
Love from the valley Weslaco Texas
https://youtu.be/tVthyPOWc-E
Going through break up with fake friends. Anthem right here
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I am SO scared to let anyone hear my voice... BUT I feel like our harmony is synchronized with this song. We are so parallel, it's CRAZY. Hurts my heart... I'm shy & I hope this comment reaches you and just you.

Father God Won't Put Anything On You Can't Bear, In Order To Progress, Trust The Process, Trust Him For He Knows Your Heart 🙏
I just found you and it hits me as hard as the day it coalesced for all the people who felt this. I am neither a southern singer fan or a mullet fan but I am a fan of this song. So thank you.
Get it Morgan Wallen
😎😎  Lauren Alaina is way way too~u^gly~ and gross to be part of any collaboration.  That's why she can't find anyone to sing with.  Nobody wants to be seen with her or sing with her in public, because she sings like a fool and looks like a loser.  She has a pathetic low life.  Kane Brown is the only person whom she can depend on, but his music career is falling apart too because of his pathetic, amateur, lousy performances at CMA awards.   He's not gonna last very long in music business either.   "Kane Brown and Khalid can't sing is an understatement".  They both sound like street singers begging for spare change in the street.  Fire them asap
So Morgan just went full on Miranda Lambert in this one and just burnt all her shit! 😂😂 Been there.. Right down to the 🔥 of this match..
I LUV EVERY SING HE HAS COME OUT WITH!!
Lol I was 13yo and my girlfriend cheated on me. It destroyed me. The next week my grandmother died , while celebrating her life my uncle obviously noticed the pain I was in.  He said something that will forever haunt/teach me. He pointed out a girl at the bar wearing a short skirt. He said. “Every girl besides your mother and sister is nothing but a slut. Why do you think she’s wearing what she is.?” Fucking hitler  traumatizing shit man.
He owes no apologies ever?  She is lucky to be ride of him. This type of macho me first, me bigger so me better is toxic masculinity.
Shit man a love country music❤
I'm a metal head all the way🤘... but my God, this song! 😭😭💔💔
Yeah

❤
This is my new ringtone....🔥🔥🔥🔥 Wasted on You
My mom had a playlist she played for me and my brother when I was around 6 years old and I never could find this song, it was one of my favorites. We would listen to this song almost every night.
I don't listen to country at all but Wow I am a FAN of this Amazing Song
Love his music
Stay strong and stay 😅🔥🔥🔥🔥
Am broken 💔💔💔 today😢😢😢
Good morning have a blessed day gina❤❤❤
INSTANTLY reminds of my ex... good riddance, LATER! *peace out*
Instant classic!!
I thought for awhile he said “all of those miles in a Chevy Impreza” and thought he knew nothing about cars turns out I knew nothing ab this song🥲
Reading so many posts about peoples  pain... it makes me feel good about one thing.. music can not only bring people together it can help to calm a soul in distress..
Sweet love this.❤❤😊

Morgan wallens setting it off harder than anyone since Waylon was getting loaded.  Facts.
Don’t even listen to country like I used got it got so pop like but I love Morgan man he’s very talented
This reminds me of an ex who really hurt me and makes me feel so grateful for my husband who is truly my twin flame. If I hadn’t been through the pain my ex caused I may not have ever found my husband

That song is perfect
Keep doing your thing!! This song and many other songs from Morgan are amazing songs very meaningful and straight from the heart
Time is never wasted when you are doing what you believe is right by someone...
She came back three times and left everytime like it’s nothing…….all of time wasted on you
I still struggling
I wish I had a support system😢.. I am dying inside everyday. I love who I am with but hate who I am. I drink to cope. But it's getting harder.
Another excellent song added to my list for the long hours to get to my fishing and hunting spots. Thanks for the vibes!!!
THis will always be my favorite Morgan Wallen song
Arguably the best new country song as of late
Half of all these views are mine
Great drinking music even after knowing every word! 😃😁🥴
I wasted a lot of time loving people that never loved me back .I feel so let down and dumb I know deep down .But wanted to believe someobe really loved me but it wasnt love they were cheating on me .Just like my gut told me always be true to yourself .If your thinking it .Your probably right
Alrighty my friends…..thinking of a bed time song..,ma needs to shut her down…..sweet bye and by.
Good song
It’s rare to look at comments and see such positivity. Some have a story and some have praise. The power of music is crazy.

Hi Morgan You are doing awesome since Voice congrats

Божественно
My babe quay just pmo Amen!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Going through a break up an this song I listen to anytime I feel like reaching out to him. He doesn’t deserve another minute wasted thank you for this song it is definitely helping me in this ❤
This song is my life. 18 years of marriage to a woman who loved me but she couldn’t ever forgive or forget the small things over the years.. even though I did that for her. She pulled away from me and her 17 year old son and just left one morning. She is cold and I don’t recognize her at all. I didn’t see it coming. There was much more good precious things in our life worth fighting for but she couldn’t see them. I die inside every day and after 2 months it’s not easier. I’ve said everything I could think of but it falls on deaf ears.Today is our 18th year anniversary and she wouldn’t even see me. I drive a Chevy killing myself to make everything and she never worked. I was happy to provide all her needs and wants. All my prayers for her over all these years didn’t seem to change anything.  I’m afraid of that day coming where I let her go.. but not today. God help me with this empty aching heart dying inside me.
One of the best county songs I've heard to date😍
you are the best i loveee your muisc
Love drunk.
Dedicated to Tracy Marie Conner
Morgan Wallen is a piece of shit, but this song is awesome.
Morgan wallen 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 I love you
This song is so fucking bad... Musical skill level: 2. How can people fall for this scam? Hah! Good production makes people forget about shit music. People are so disappointing. This song is so so shit.
sorry dad... x_x i was too busy savin the world to be good
The blues, country music is a tribute to the blues... show me the color of pain... its not obout skin its about the heart.
Finally a blessed song and artist to put county music back on the right road again been a long time coming
we;; shit  seems i'm a morgan wallen fan
Afyer 27 yrs. My wife cheated on me and left me for a scumbag meth head. She was my love, my best friend, and my everything. Ive been lost since and im finally picking up the pieces. This song is helping me heal. Thank you
Oh, this song was written for me! I can't stop listening to it.
So beautiful, so true.
5 years 3 months sober thank you and God bless you
Me at 25 weeks pregnant waiting for my ride while listening to this song. My baby is kicking, good music.
Love this song, it's already getting stuck in my head! ❤
❤❤❤
Best song out to this day
Ballz
Bittersweet Beautiful Song!!! great songwriting!!!
He doesn’t need a Grammy or Oscar they need him
It’s not about how She did him wrong…it’s about how much time he spent getting drunk and recollecting on how it ended…took me about a hundred times listening to it..but I get it..wasted=drunk…all the time all the money…
🔥
Just wanna say thanks ….
I just found Morgan and I'm obsessed......
🖤
As a former country singer, I can assure everyone that Morgan is the next George Strait.
Recently divorced and as lonely as you can get. All my friends gone and family is there including the kids when I see them. Live alone now and this song makes me think if I changed my way how beautiful my life would’ve been. She’s moved on and is happy which I’m happy for but leaves me out in the dust. Don’t take your wife for granted and be happy with what you have. The grass isn’t always greener on the other side. 😢
Dude
Oh I love him
Durk a real one for putting this song on one of his posts, big respect Durkiio
I the times that I was going throw depression on cuzzing from my dad and just but on Morgan Wallen to help me get throw it
Wasted
This beat go crazy!!!
He left me and our four babies for a girl who carries herself so ugly, has felony charges etc. I did everything for this man and gave my all. Known him 20 years, we were married 11 and a half years ... me and our 4 babies can't understand why he put her first and threw us out to move her in. Completely shattered I loved him with every ounce I had in me 🥺😞 now me and our babies are suffering .
Thx Morgan my Roblox friend delete me as there friend and I song this song to them
I just want you to understand I love you
I like him whether he said n*g$@ or not ! Coming from a mixed person … dude you’re good we love your music 😊
Good song
17 years of my life Wasted . All meant nothing.
Don't drink and drive.
This man is a legend
starting to pour that strong one a lil too often
This song speaks to my heart. Its all my fault. All of this time and money and all these sorries i damn sure dont owe you. Wasted time on you. (YES NOT THE EXACT LYRICS) just how i feel 🤷‍♀️
I guess im learning the hard way again i dropped the ball i felt that in my jb
❤
Absolutely Love This Song! Check Out @Partyalone Version Aswell. Im 100% Sure Morgan Wallen Would Approve. https://youtu.be/nrMLnDssxtI
I can relate to this masterpiece 😭
There was this girl I fell in love with named Kristen. Every time I saw her my heart skipped a beat. She was gorgeous and she didn’t even know it. She was the perfect combination of funny outspoken smart and beautiful. I changed for her did everything I could to make myself the man that she wanted and it still wasn’t enough. I would have treated her like the queen that she is. In another life me and her would be together. Instead I’m just an also ran in her life, and I’m jealous of every guy that gets to hold her, kiss her, touch her. I’d give anything to be able to touch her lips and push the hair out of her beautiful eyes.
Omw to break up with my gf just to feel this song harder!
Just a beautiful song. Can't stop listening to this. Wasted too much time for sure on someone who didn't have the capacity to care too much, except about himself and lies. Don't waste your time. Spend your time and your love on your loved ones and on those that need your help. Spread your warmth and kindness around and don't waste it on those who deceive you and don't appreciate it!
Yes, wasted On You💔
💜
They all owe me I already sent the files in
This song makes me wanna drink wtf lean back on the bourbon baby
❤❤❤
My ex just showed back in my life about a month ago and i’ve been on the stool ever since. Tryna be stronger this time. philly ❤
I love that this country artist actually sounds country.  I also love that he's not glossed over, cookie-cutter, Nashville manufactured like so many others.
MORGAN WALLENNNNNNNNNNNNNN
If "fuck you bitch" had a reference song
Morgan thank you 🙏 just got through the worst break up ❤
This song helping me though this hard separation and hopefully soon divorce
“Just thinking ‘bout all I’ve wasted on you,, All of this time and all of this money,, All of these sorry I don’t owe you honey” hits home every time I hear bro say them words. If you’re going thru it Stay up kings. It’ll get better eventually
that voice just makes everything better 😍
new celebrity crush :) 🥰🤩😍
drug dealing mofos
Let's give it up for the guy singing harmony 🥰🥰 really rounds out the vocals
✨♥️🌟💥
Proud of ya !!!
I would love to see him in concert, but I be damned if I'm paying $500 to $600 for a lawn seat to see him.  No thank you sir.
This song has so much power 😢
Stay strong 💪
My favorite song I feel younger
😌❤🍃
Love this song!  Can really relate
I'd like to make a point that, all of his music makes women want him/ hate men, it's actually a genius move, that makes the rest of us look crapy
That's what my old life is like but I have found God
Bro you know Me bro get me out there with you bro ..... please bro 😊
Love the song. But my request is make one with George strait. And Kenny Chesney. It will be the song ever made. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ think about it. A lot of great guys
1 yr and 4 months sober keep up the good work brother it's the hardest thing I've ever done 👏👏👏
Oh gosh and this one! Beautiful! ❤
Jesus loves u
I dedicate this song to my ex fiance. That lying, cheating, married jackass. THAT JERK ACTED LIKE HE WAS SINGLE. Then came to the truth he was married. Also flirting with 3 to more women. karma Is COMING. An the good part is I told this clown that I know the woman that he was suppose to meet up. I also told him I know her ex-husband. Oh yea One of the other women her and I are friends now. Now is the time to talk to his wife.
Morgan bringing back the mullet
This dude ain’t get shit on the church man
Great job CANCEL CULTURE......you made him more popular and most of his music is actually pretty good. Now go work on the rappers that use the "N" word all day long and leave the rest of us alone
love you 🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠
This song is strangely relevant to me right now.
Wat a great song
I’m Mormon and recently started drinking I thought she was the one and I’m struggling I hope to have to find your strength
The greed of your fans are showing, getting free tickets and selling them for 800-1000$
Jesus loves u
Left abuse and violence in my life partner to my drug addiction and having  lost 2 years of my baby's life is the affect of my life and my experiences with tand the self-centered aspects that 💔 brought a broken heart into the healing process of the debacle of what's happened in mine and  the lives of others who live in my community are not the only damaging things.  I'm sad to see people hurting that I contributed to it in the past. But today is a new day and normal life will happen again but I have been dealing with the situation the design of the con is sliding of the power the hands, the shell games. I know my truth always tells it's self true lies falling apart around me because of the way ppl are learning about me from me, I am coming outside to help out with the kids for family and friends community and committed to my baby and myself deeply humble and very grateful to have survived this. decisions about whoever is going to be loyal to me to our friendship is what I am looking at.  Cutting the fat and has been awakening with undiscribable pains that can be undone with.  Wasted  on you has saves me so thankful for your work and your dedication to truth
This is an
😎🔥🔥🔥🔥 man been goin through it it's been a crazy time for everyone
Regardless of the gender of either partner, abuse can be done. If you or someone you know is in an unhealthy relationship, know you/they are not alone. We need to normalize conversations that discuss these situations so people don't feel responsible or ashamed. Everyone is deserving of love and respect.❤️‍🩹🫶🏽
Man yeah
I love drinking
Nailed it 👍
One of my favourite songs ❤️
My favorite song 🎵 ❤️
Hitting deep in the soul. Great music surpasses boundaries.
Kid can sing
She walked out that door for a "friend" after 18 years together, a house and dog ...life planned, life lost...this one hits home hard
Love your song bro
Drunk and wasted on you
I never wasted one moment with you ❤️
I’ve quit everything but drinking. I just can’t let it go
Saying sorry is taking accountability for your own actions, so maybe you need to say sorry so that you can heal. Just saying
I gave drinking a year ago the same day I stop loving you Michael
Country song make me chill & relax
I like it.
Nice song
3 years sober from Alcohol Thanksgiving 2023 💪🏻
amazing sound, voice and lyrics!!!
What's the best drug to overdose quick? I can't take this pain.
This song is so true wasted to much money and ten year of my life.  He was a control freak
My new favorite song. Love his voice!
Ive got this as my ringtone!
5 years 2 kids later, Guess I'm learnin the hard way again
I thank this man for this song.
U make me laugh   Don't dish out what you can't Swallow
Кантри , блядь как же я хочу уехать из России
For once I want to know what it is to feel loved and loyalty from someone.
Not happy but still trying to make it work
I have been single for 2 years now and that was an amazing song that Morgan did I hope he continues what he does best and that is singing wonderful songs
Let's go Morgan fallen
If I were Morgan I would never change the guitar player who sings the back vocals. He's simply amazing!
It's got my vote for pop song of the year..
karaoke nite average
I wish I wrote this song!
My son and wife was attacked by my own dog, man, all of those good times i spent wasted on you dog.
Going to read some. Prayers from the Quran to my son!!’n
This is one of ur prettiest songs cousin love Kira happy Ramadan
I wasted 10.
One of the greatest voices in music
this is my fav song
This song is an undiscovered gem. Excellent lyrics.
I been dating someone for last 10 years she just told me find someone with money she been playing with mine damn feeling like trash
And to think he was canceled couple years ago... he the king of country atm
Wow, Powerful!..
Your voice is getting even better, nice bro, singer since I was 5, now 57. Keep it up, good song. I love the note carry, very cool.
Friend of mine posted this song, this is the first time I've ever heard it, and it really resonated with me, I battled meth addiction on and off for almost 15 years of my life, this December I will have 9 year's clean from it.
I hear him singing about 3 distinct types of wasted in this song, and it’s so good.
🥰🥰 love it
This song right here ❤
Love it
How I feel ab the alcohol in my hand rn I’m not even 21 bro I’ve used this shit since I was 12-13 used to take pills too I got off the pills cuz I saw my friends strung out and now I just smoke and drink I’m just so tired of feeling sick and shit wish I was a better man
Remember boys if you leave your girl your life will come back together becouse you won't see your money shrink or disappear,for some reasom it's sad but true ,all the respectable girls/women don't want me it's always the broke women that care only bout dick and money that seem to be my type so I'm sick and tired of this shit ,I'm gonna try staying single for a while and spend my money on me
This song is fabulous and I hope he never gets rid of the guy who does harmony with him. Their voices just go so well together
It is the opposite. I have wasted my time on a nation of privileged people. Maybe if they were stuck under a rubble, they would appreciate what they have in life.
Hey @Morgan Wallace, I had a neighbor who was the son of the owner and his wife like 15 years ago. He looked exactly like you his name was keif and looked exactly just like you man. His father won the lottery. Like 30,000 dollars and they moved on with life. He was my friend, showed me a gun the morning he was moving away, and what it looked like. It was my first time seeing one in America so it was impressive. Truth be told, my only “fettish” in this world are handguns. Honestly it’s like that third true and only love in life.
Awsome song morgan!best song of the year you only have one mom!
❤️ 💙 💜
Morgan rocks
Yea at first my wife thought I mean her but na I just liked the song and related it to wasting time doing shit I shouldn't have (fentanyl) lost my job ect most my friends and if not for her and my grandkids I wouldn't be here ty god
Good song
Had 2 horrible relationships back to back. 12 Years of Heartbreak, lies and cheating while I sat Home crying and praying. So I can relate to this song. Thank GOD, my Prince Charming saved me.❤
51 days for me. Go us!
Thank you for keeping me alive. Your music teaches you to never give up. Find your happiness
Great singer

This song is AMAZING
This song hits deep...it was def my fault for our breakup, but the way it ended and have known her for 15 years and dated for 6, she just literally just stopped all communication. So this song was not me being upset with her but upset with the situation and how I wish it could have been handled diff

Damn this song is so good!!
Just left a 3 year relationship to a narcissist who always had an excuse for every time he cheated. This song is my anthem. Thank you Morgan.
Best Damn song
i love morgan wallen
This song is how I started listening to Country music 😆 Morgan Wallen on repeat 🎶
Your voice is amazing.
This song is one of my favorites that truly hit me deep, when you try and make things work , but know it will never, cuz all the lies and all the other bullshit that comes out their mouth, I try and be legit about everything I do in my life then you give your heart to someone that can do all the bullshit they do to you. Thank you Morgan for helping me get through all that bullshit too ....
This is what my brother went through with his wife before she left him, and he passed away
So needed to hear these responses we all can relate, I'm sure. All love.
Awesome song fits for Chris young
love this song amazing i get u big time xx
This is the dude who had to apologize for a slur to snowflakes. Sent to re-education camp. Just think about that
hows the world 🌍 full of “races” but still RACIST rip takeoff 🛫
Really love this song ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I love your songs😊
l feel country out my heart wouldn't list. 🤠💔❤‍🩹🙏
My BF and I got in an argument and I decided to put music on and this randomly popped up on my YouTube.... this is exactly how I feel about this relationship with him
MY BROTHER SHOT HIMSELF A FEW DAYS AGO. THIS WAS HIS FAVORITE SONG. WHEN I HEAR IT I FEEL HIM CLOSE. THANK U FOR UR MUSIC
I was with someone whom I loved deeply but to find out he never loved me at all. This song I play over and over again. This man who continues to play with my heart strings this song song helps me daily to make me realize he's not worth my time anymore.
Love his music sounds like they old country music 🎶
He just sing smooth as silk nothing being forced .that called talent and working on your craft .he LL probably get better
💯 💯 💯 2:17 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
What is the brand and model of the acoustic guitar?
🤙🤙🍺🍺🤠🇺🇸🎆🍺
Wasted on u ♥
🖤🖤🖤
Not a big country fan like some but my god Iike this dude
I hated country music until I heard this song.
Not a country music fan. At all. This just started playing on one of the radio stations that is like one of THE big 3 in my state. Like JUST started playing. Came on here to find, ITS TWO YEARS OLD? Wtf are these radio stations doing these days? I feel as though the numbers for the initial release of this song would have been top level on other charts.  "January 11, 2021, and is the fourth single from the album “Dangerous: The Double Album.” The song peaked at number 9 in the Billboard Hot 100 charts and topped the Billboard US Hot Country Songs and US Country Airplay charts. The song was also an instant hit internationally, topping the country charts in Canada and peaking at number 10 in the Canadian Hot 100 charts."  This is playing almost on repeat now on our Pop and even some Rock stations. 2 years Later. Music industry could have done this guy much better. Its not uncommon in my state to hear Pantera, Metallica then this play. OR on another station, you might hear Katie Perry, Lorde, This. No joke. Some music reaches past those hard "genre" definitions. This is one of those songs.
Very soulful and talented!
This is A classic country song..as a black male...I really like it...
It bothers me that a dumb catchy pop songs that people will forget in a month always gets a billion views but good music like this doesn’t….
Boys, love your music but even crap seats are over 500 through Ticketmaster, way too rich for workin folks.
I hate this
All I know is I miss all my old friends
Great job on the singing
He sounds good in the studio, but trash and off key live. Don’t waste your money on his concert tickets 👎
I SCEAM every word of this song. I love Morgan Wallen so much.❤
Fire content keep slaying the day
This man can sing to me all day every day
My 12 years with my ex...  wasted....
Holy shit this hits hard
this manzs got me a breakup
Потрясающая песня, душевная и потрясающий вокал😊🔥
man he look like he lip singing
This song me relise that I need to stay away from girls and fokus on myself thank you so much Morgan love you so much brother
Annasia sherrod I spent so much time and money and tears  wasted on you 💔
This is A great song
Crazy how a ten year relationship can come crashing down like it was nothing. I sit and think about all of my struggles and the effort I put into it....all of the effort wasted
Crazy
Love ❤ this song 🎵
I would never waste any time being with you. I am just blown away by you
As an African American middle aged white man I feel this song to my core.
Way to Morgan
Love this song
Great Song
Love yourself more then anyone can ever love you, then you will be unbreakable and always prepared for splitsvilles every time, banging song tho. Can't wait for fenway this summer to rock out
the break up happened. thanks for helping me get through it
I love this song
I don't even listen to country... I needed this song though.
Y’all I like this song
What the hell is this sound stupid I'd rather Listen to A Little Pony get butchered
And I should have left years ago
Just ended a 11 year relationship.  Well February 14 would have been 11 years
13 years of marriage that ended with 5 kids. This is my song.
Amazing man 👍🏻
Cutest cats and dogs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhc-xMnKthY
😎😎  Lauren Alaina is way way too~u^gly~ and gross to be part of any collaboration.  That's why she can't find anyone to sing with.  Nobody wants to be seen with her or sing with her in public, because she sings like a fool and looks like a loser.  She has a pathetic low life.  Kane Brown is the only person whom she can depend on, but his music career is falling apart too because of his pathetic, amateur, lousy performances at CMA awards.   He's not gonna last very long in music business either.   "Kane Brown and Khalid can't sing is an understatement".  They both sound like street singers begging for spare change in the street.  Fire them asap
I love this song
I told my ex when she leaves me this is gona be her song. 😢😅
As an African American woman I can honestly say music knows no race. I feel this song to the depths of my soul. Spent 7 years giving my all to someone just to find out 2 days before Christmas (2022) he proposed to another woman he met on vacation in 2019 while in Europe… all them days I spent wasted on you 🤦🏾‍♀️
Just broke up a 7 year relationship a few days ago. We both did a lot of wasting. 😢
j'adore cette chanson !
Yep wasted right now 👍
All of the sorry's I don't owe you honey! Yep! Alone is very peaceful! :)
He's a superstar
Samantha’s love this song
Wasted on You / Lyrics I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Ah, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault Yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinking 'bout all I've wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learning the hard way again That's why I've been Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you

This is a great live performance & props to his friend for playing guitar while singing higher harmonies
Amazing song !
😎😎  Lauren Alaina is way way too~u^gly~ and gross to be part of any collaboration.  That's why she can't find anyone to sing with.  Nobody wants to be seen with her or sing with her in public, because she sings like a fool and looks like a loser.  She has a pathetic low life.  Kane Brown is the only person whom she can depend on, but his music career is falling apart too because of his pathetic, amateur, lousy performances at CMA awards.   He's not gonna last very long in music business either.   "Kane Brown and Khalid can't sing is an understatement".  They both sound like street singers begging for spare change in the street.  Fire them asap

So true
I hear you from Brazil. I'm going to pick up the pieces of my broken heart. For romantics, love is chaos. 🌹
I miss my step dad 😭 every few months I hear a song that I need to listen to by myself at night under blankets and just cry it out it's random I wish he was still in our 🌎
D,g🎉heart is a good friend ❤❤❤❤❤❤Greyson
Relationships suck
Well I'm 58 and starting over four the fifth time I have fallen in love with my dream girl and she is my salvation
My girlfriend just broke up with me yesterday 😢
Lauren Alaina?  Odd looking eyes, nose, lips, and hips.  She thinks she's a singer.   She's not a singer.   She's nothing but an u..gly American idol contestant in 2011..
I fell apart  listening this song .for a 7 years relationship  that i never had.
Hey brother quick homie check up… hope you’re doing well 🤙🏽
Absolutely LOVE this song!!! ❤❤❤
PERFECT SONG! REMINDS ME OF SOME VERY, VERY, CLOSE,  SPECIAL  PEOPLE , I AM WATCHING THEIR RELATIONSHIP GO DOWN FASTER AND, FASTER! THIS SONG FITS THE SCRIPT! BUT ITS HEARTBREAKING 💯 AT THE SAME TIME 💔💧😢! LORD GOD 🙏 HELP US ALL!
❤
who else here cause Spotify down?
I'm stuck on drugs not much of a drinker
😭 idk even know rn if this is from me to him or the other way around, but I've had heartbreaks and I've stayed friends with exes & I've helped everyone else get through bs but this time it's different & I'm starting to regret for the first time in my life...
I know words to that song ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
What a great song!!
This one hits deep. Suck having to make the decision to go.
I think he got his money back writing this song. Not to mention the ladies.
This song says exactly what we all feel when it's over, for me it wasn't a romance but a family member and the words still fit exactly. All of this time, money, miles, prayers ... Wasted on you. Gifted songwriter! This song is helping me through!!!! Thank you! ♥️
There’s a few country songs I duck with & this is one of them
Starts off great, and ends ehhhhh
I love this song it’s so good !
Man, you and jelly roll could really collaborate. Similar voices with different music . I'll even say ..... Please
Great song! Keep on keeping on!
Hi my name is Josh Whitmire. I live in Vidor TX yes the same town George Jones is from. I know literally every song of Morgan's word for word and can sing and play most of them. Easily my favorite modern country singer. I do alot of karaoke in local bars some morgan songs and drake white too but mostly Conway Twitty everyone loves it. Nicknamed me Conway Whitty. Lol
I do not like country music but I’m obsessed with this song. Found it on Apple Music by accident. I just love this song.
Happy 2 year anniversary to this song! It’s my go-to when I wanna sing/shout at my steering wheel.
Thanks Morg.

My husband is and has been an addict for the last six years. I've tried everything to help him, and in typical addict behavior, he always blames his actions on me and I've accepted that. I don't know why. Maybe I just have such low self esteem that when he says these things my brain just accepts them because I already think that I'm not deserving? But I'm getting tired of it, really, really, really tired of it. He gaslights me and sometimes I catch it and sometimes I don't but he never will admit to it. He has a way of turning it around on me and trying to make me feel guilty for asking if he's used, or anything really. And he never admits to using unless he knows he's already been caught. He will say that he used because we got into a fight or because I pushed him away, it's ALWAYS my fault, he never takes responsibility for his actions. But it's been six years of the same crap, i know when he's high and it breaks my heart. He puts meth above me and our children and I'm tired of apologizing to him when I'm not the one doing anything wrong. Thankfully, he never treats the children any different, I'm the only one who sees that side of him, but I'm tired. And this song just hits home and it hurts. I need out but I'm stuck. I'm disabled but I'm waiting for my disability to go through and I haven't had much luck with that so I'm completely reliant on him. And I love him to death but he won't stop, I don't think he'll ever stop, and I'm not going to be here in six years still doing this shit. I love him, but my kids come first and they are getting older and they are smart, I can't let them see that stuff. I need to figure something out, I just don't know how.

God I know from my years and the ones I've wasted all my good days on
My  husband of 20 YEARS had an affair when I was going through a breast cancer scare and then blindsided me with divorce papers out of the blue 3 days after his 40th birthday 3 months ago. I've been devastated. This song speaks to my soul.
Wasted now
I wish morgan would collaborate with Eric Church.

Surely someone has tabs
Just ended my first actual relationship screwed it all up 3 year I messed up of my life just gone
Just left a 19 yr marriage yesterday and man does this song hit home. The only thing that wasn’t a waste was i have amazing kids from it. I’ll be listening to this on repeat for months
⁰400⁵
Sings pretty good!Reminds me of Noah Thompson another Country singer  both are Awesome 🎸🎤🎶🎵😊👍
This song has saved my soul, Going through divorce and losing my whole world. Praise God baby
This song just tugged on my heart. I went through a bad breakup and it did a number on me in the worst way.
Drinkin to this… probably listen to this whenever I get sober👊🏽🍻
best song of all time
First country song I've looked up in years!!!!
Kane Brown:  the worst singer.   The worst song in a century.  Who wants to listen to his songs?
After a year plus struggle of ending 12 years of heartache, this song helped me find the words and lifted a weight. Thank you

Music is powerful.. But the emotions that those feel, while listening to the music, is tenfold..
Can I get some love here from another brother! I lost so much of myself trying to please her and give her everything she wished of me. Nothing was ever enough
Working on being wasted right now
Great song!
That’s why I’ve been wasted on you
I am a Puerto Rican woman who can appreciate good music , this man is amazing 👏
Best verse ever in country music!! 🔥 Facts 1st verse
❤❤❤❤😊
I'm sending it to her. She's on the fence and I'm tired of the games. Damn this is 100% me right now.
Pouring a strong one now
So this is considered country? This would be just a cool ballad song =) Why is not this music more supported ?. this is a trillion times better than the dumb rap / r&b songs that the US tries to export
not bad
Beautiful
All of this time wasted on you... Currently 💯
Hi Morgan wallen Carter kitchen
I was in a Lyft going home and I heard this song and I can relate to the words of the song.
I have never ever listen to Morgan songs .Heard the name. Never been to a show . Until I met a  country.fellow on tik Tok . I  pull up  his songs on Pandora.  Dam where in hell was I at . Surer as hell must of been on the wrong side of track. I thought I would go to a show. Na I am good can't afford $1000 a ticket .  I just pass you on the street.  And wave at ypu. Thank you Morgan Wallen for  opening up wounds I keep closed for years . 🙏 You Rock Country.  I just call you the big brother and friend I never met ❤️
Country gettin back to basics I love it🍒💣💥♥️
Always wasted on you
come on ry  with me
A feeling I feel now in my life over the woman I love till my last breath
Who’s the background singer because he’s feeling the song too
im in love with this song like gowd damn this man is fire and so is this song i listen to this song and other songs of his on repeat
Awesome song.
Every time never fails I am a sucker for love. like a deer in the headlights to pray to the Lord up above. It never fails I get screwed over every time because I'm too nice I fell in love with yet another but this song right here Morgan I feel that you just wrote it just for me and like your other song that I keep playing over and over cover me up that one right there is how I am as an individual but then you never cease to amaze me it's like you're my best friend and don't even know me but you do with your music once again I'm a victim of circumstance love something that doesn't love you back and watching it all unfold in front of you but still loving that person till they destroy you is a hard thing to do anyways I got a call out that woman by name because I believe everybody should be brought to Justice in their own way all darkness becoming light so Angela Mormann your a lying selfish Hippocratic whore who pretty much acts like a refugee prisoner of an abusive controlled relationship I ain't your knight in shining armor I was your enabler and cosigner for all your bullshit well at least you know what real love felt like for a change too much for you to handle..''Angela Mormann,'” you had me at my worst but you don't deserve me at my best''.
Damn, Theo Von can sing.

Slays Morgan Wallis 😍 ✨️
I'm not big on breakup songs but this song hits the ball out of the park. I love Morgan Wallen this song helps me through my day most of the time. It's now on repeat on my playlist.
I do NOT like Country Music but I Love this Song & this Artist----he has Crossed Over to Pop Charts which is very Rare for a Country Artist--but it`s so obvious as to why---he`s SUPER TALENTED with a very Likeable Unique type of voice----most Country Artist sound too similar in my opinion----with no versatility between songs.....
This song is incredible!!!!
I love this song
Luv that bourbon
🎉🎉🎉
Masterpiece
I can totally relate to this song going through a heart break thats over a woman I wished and prayed would never come. Had a crush on her for 11 years finally had my chance clawed my way fighting for the love she had for me at the beginning that was short lived in comparison she finally told me last night she'll message me in the future if friendship would even work 😭 this songs been on repeat
He's old hos soul
Ive been so heartbroken and drunk as fuck with this song on repeat for hour's ! Going to work hungover for months this song got thru it for sure
Love this song can't stop listening to it it relates to me so much
Love pouring those strong ones in the morning 👍

So awesome
My story
The man has a very strong voice.  Nothing weak about it.  Commanding presence on the mic.  Which usually translates into phenomenal live performances that sound just as good as the track itself.
I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Ah, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault Yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinking 'bout all I've wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learning the hard way again That's why I've been Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money  All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money  All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you  Wasted on you Wasted on you  Wasted on you

That was perfect ! I know that drives it home for alot of us.
I love your songs

😎😎  Lauren Alaina is way way too~u^gly~ and gross to be part of any collaboration.  That's why she can't find anyone to sing with.  Nobody wants to be seen with her or sing with her in public, because she sings like a fool and looks like a loser.  She has a pathetic low life.  Kane Brown is the only person whom she can depend on, but his music career is falling apart too because of his pathetic, amateur, lousy performances at CMA awards.   He's not gonna last very long in music business either.   "Kane Brown and Khalid can't sing is an understatement".  They both sound like street singers begging for spare change in the street.  fire them from country asap
I can't stop listening. the vocals and the melody melts my heart.
This song is to the T... sad but true words
I've been through so much lately this song hits deep.
Cool
Come to the wedding I’m on my way to the Vatican and one day I’ll be the next pope
This song is so true  I was in love with him and he didnt care about me..he ended the relationship. Left me shattered.
The lyrics, the vocals, the melody. Everything about this song is pure genius!
This song is gonna be good for a long time
I feel like this is my marriage. Shit hits me in my soul and masterfully put together and sung. A true piece of art.
Best song on the album
How goods this song without a drum machine
I can feel my relationship coming to an end it’s been 2 beautiful and hurtful years of stress love defeat caring and anxiety but it’s okay I would do it all again I love her so much but I can feel her slowly slipping away I just want what’s best for her

I love you soooo much my mom is going to your concert in 2023 but I Walt  goo so I’m cinda Sade I be with by dad
Beautiful music 😎👌😉😱
15 years together still going strong  You leave one women to get the same shit all women are the same that is facts
My wife can be a bitch but doesn't mean I am walking away  I am a Christian I am sticking to the Christian rules until death does us part
Why break up when you can make up  Life isn't a fairy tale  fixs what is broken  Love isn't walking around the beach holding hands  It's about sticking together threw the storm
Fix it don't give up
Love this song
This is one song I'll take over a Rap song any day I felt this
When does the pain stop when you realize it was the perfect woman for you and you totally fucked up  and she's moved on with another man
love it love it love it
❤❤❤❤❤
Every  straight man can relate..
New to his music. Loving it so far
Favorite.. girls no matter what  Don't Let it be autopilot radio DJ Vee Doll Her She.

God help me I have covid n supports cut bck only got enough meat till wed night halfed my meat to last . Can do groceries tter week . If better.
I've listened to this song over a this times & I have too say this song reminds me of little big town saga with the song girl crush where the guy hears his first loves cry hoping that he'll wake up and see through his new flames bs & he finally does. I highly recommend listening to Little Big Town's song Girl Crush then Go back to Morgan's beautifully soulful song Wasted on you!
You guys should listen to the song bottom of the edge.
This song is great
love this song
I love you and your music soo uch thnks sooo much youve got me throughj alot i really Thank God for having such great artists like you ❤God bless America

Miss my mom💔
I can't think when his songs come on. Period. And I'm an overactive thinker. He starts singin' and I stop cold, no matter what I'm doin', everything freezes and then all I want to do is listen, melt into it and sing with him! Love it!
I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Ah, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault Yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinking 'bout all I've wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learning the hard way again That's why I've been Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money  All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money  All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you  Wasted on you Wasted on you  Wasted on you
Can we acknowledge the double meaning in these lyrics? “Wasted” on you… Drinking the pain away, getting wasted. 🥹
My ex wife sent me this song only about 3 months ago and it was the first time I heard it. It has a special meaning for me, although she wanted to get back together,  at 1st I was for it, then I told myself.....we divorced for a reason. Thx for reading this.
Im black and this has become one of my favorite songs
I sing through some and hum through some but dang this songs hits me hard!
I loved my husband but he was an alcoholic and so many years drinking everyday was just the norm and looking back it makes me so angry I wasted so much time drinking or canceling plan because he was drunk. Everything's changed since then this song really hits home
Real country again
It’s crazy cause I’m listening to this simultaneously thinking of a girl who’s heart I broke and another girl who broke my heart (that led to the girl who’s heart I broke). 😬
As I listened to this song I realize how much energy and time I wasted on a marriage to a person who never really loved me as much as I loved him thank you for such a great song Morgan
Damn tryin to quit drinking but it hard you better man. Then me
Aussie country music is the stuff, but this is not bad
Straight Trash.
So love his intro n so relevant to my past
I wish someone had even loved me enough to feel this mad about it not working out. Does that make sense to anyone?
This song never gets old. It hits home.
❤❤ this song
I love Morgan he can really sing love his music very much
Amazingly talented bastard.😁
This is mg go to song whenever I'm upset and depressed I turn it up really loud
Third time getting cheated on by mother of my kids this time was with a hippie from the gas station lmao,finally got me to leave ,tried before for the kids , tried everything,  learning the hardway again line hits to hard!!!
Totally agree
Omg I LOVE THIS
My feelings towards a man I've been with since 2008 and living with his alcoholism in prayer hoping he would see what he's doing to us in this sickness and never wanting to get help. Well I'm through, it's time to say Goodbye!
Morgan can you please put more tikits on for london canda so I can get 3 so me my mom and my dad can come to it this will be the first concert I go to so please do
This song isn't long enough. I had to play it on repeat 97 times.
Man I think I listened to this song about 200 times in a week …. She broke my heart
Horrible
Mumble county..👎🏾👎🏾🤮🤮
I just lost my girl of 8 years !!! I'm messed up man!!!
So much better with real drums
If one song were on my lifes soundtrack this would be that song right now -- broke down Chevy to boot...😔
This song reminded me been drinking and smoke a lot of tobacco, now I am sober from cigarettes and booze. I have save a lot money, make healthier choices and have a healthy hobby.
💥💥💥💥
Great Song
Good voice but this isn’t country. Non of todays artists are country. I miss country

When Morgan whallen is the one that kept you going through the hardest time of your life
loove this song!!! andi dont listen to country.....replay replay
Oh my good god I need to meet this man.
Love your music
Wasted on you
I. Love you so much 💗💗 And I. Love your songs 💜💕💖
8years alpst 9 years together me and my wife just come find out there's another dude, yet I'm the one to blame for it all falling apart. All the while Shea to distracted to to see her own faults, shed always deflect the question if anything was going on, and honestly today me and that dude had some words. He literally calls my wife and twists the story all on me, I walked away cause of my anger I did the right thing yet my so called(soon to be divorced) wife joins him on beating me down to the point where I just left. How can someone turn their back on someone they supposedly love and care about...fuck outta here you lost your damn mind if you think ima waste anything on you ever again....
Love his music I always feel this song. About everyone that I ever wasted my time on. Thank Mr Morgan
735 a ticket ? No ! In the day a band was hot because they were good and now the band is hot because they charge outrageous amounts for a ticket .trash
Imo I wish this was the og version of the song. I personally like the acoustic vibes over pop/hip hop sound.
You send that song why love you too
wow i am in love! ❤
Just had to walk away from a 12 years relationship for reasons I will not say, but ur wors in this song spike to me

Heartfelt YUP
I was with this guy for a year, we talked about our future and marriage. Right before our 1 year anniversary I got a message from his mom that he passed away from an overdose. I fell apart. My heart and soul was shattered and ripped from me. I was in the darkest place I have ever been. After 4 years of not smoking I started up again. I cried around the clock with a roller-coaster of emotions. I was so angry with him and missing him so much. While I was still in my darkness, I found out he had been cheating on me and I got so angry with him and pissed off with myself for still crying over him. Then in my car while thinking of him and getting ready to cry again, this song came on and it hit me hard.... I still have my moments when I miss him and tear up. I mourn for the guy I thought I was in love with, but I'm so angry with the guy who passed away and the answers I'll never know to my questions 💔 Thank you for this song!! It gives me strength and a voice I had lost within my grief...
😭😭😭😭
Man I love your voice!!! 😍😍 Had to put headphones on just to listen to this song on repeat
Imagine if this man was unfairly put behind bars just because he said something in his own privacy that most of anyone says, regardless of your race. We wouldn't have had the pleasure of listening to such amazing songs such as this one.
He sacrificed his sole for this
🎶🎼Wasted on you  I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Ah, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault Yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinking 'bout all I've wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorries I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learning the hard way again That's why I've been Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money  All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money  All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you  Wasted on you Wasted on you  Wasted on you
This has been my song for the past month. Everyday these lyrics make more and more sense and telling of my situation
Morgan is a sexy man lemme tell yea
I listen to this song on repeat  before work every day. If I had YT music wrapped, this be #1.
Time waits on no one so get on with it,…..😢
I'm Thanh made 2
Not a huge country fan but I could listen to this on repeat.

GLad I'm not the only one out there with this kind of life experiences
This song changed my opinion on country music, can't stop listening to it. 🤠
Racist, redneck sporting a mullet that can't sing a song about anything but drinking. Yeah, a real legend.
This guy be helping me through my break up.
I was wishing for a music video but after this I'm more than satisfied
I definitely dedicated this song to my best friend name Ashlee Nicole I love my lil beautiful bestie 💕 aka Lil Pot Roast ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I'm so proud to have a beautiful independent strong mindset lady like her in my life ...
Right down to the flame on this match!  Holy Shit!!! And RIGHT!!!
My 2022 recap why is this only my #3 song 🎵 ❤️
This song could not more " dead on" to describe my very complicated relationship that has become so delabiltating for me even when we are together its no longer the same and I am still left empty and and hurt and vacant inside but I can't break away because of how strongly I feel for this person and our memories which were the best of every emotion words can't describe. This song is on repeat until im strong enough to end what was the best and the worst emotional experience in my life. Music is about connecting real life emotions and passion so real and sometimes very painful it can cripple the strongest of men. Now once and a while a good songwriter finds the words to describe these feelings and put them down on paper and music that can let others know who are feeling these emotions and that connection is more valuable to move someone to begin to heal than any amount of money spent on therapy or anything we seek out to try to get through something as hard as the person who we love more than ANYTHING but they don't feel about us the same way anymore.
Anyone else here because they heard Chevy Impreza in this song?
This is song is wack
Love it ❤❤❤❤❤
Lyrics 🍃 I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Aw, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets to burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault, yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone, and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinkin' 'bout all I've wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen To my head and these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again That's why I've been Wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you

Absolutely heart touching song❤️
Amazing Words ☺️👍 Story Of My Life Wasted Time😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I could listen to this song on repeat and never get tired of it💗  Edit: after listening to this song it reminded me of me being heartbroken after going after people that just hurt the relationship, and me just crying and saying sorry over and over trying to make the relationship work.
Police are enroute for several cases of verbal abuse now
I love this song!!!! As you can see it relatable in all perspective! Job well done #classic

Any breakup album, Morgan, Adele, Taylor, Miranda lambert, post malone....They're all epic bc it was raw experience put into music. ❤
So grateful to be able to listen to this song and enjoy it but I must say I can't relate... not today satan
I never listened to country a day in my life I grew up on rnb rap and no offense I'm a 30yr old African American but heard this song today with a coworker slash great friend and he's a lot older but he was playing it in the work truck and his voice blew my mind and I didn't know the name of the song but the lyrics stuck with til I got home and I searched on YouTube and it was the best decision I made all year you've changed my view on country music and gained a fan for life thanks for such a great voice and hell of a good song I'm playing this all day everyday I've done listened to it 5 times back to back
All this $money
Wow!! Love it 🙋🏾‍♀️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song is comforting yet sad.. as I am going through a breakup after 10 years of been together.. not easy to walk away from.
I am engaged in love with my Caucasian white handsome boyfriend wealthy healthy Anthony Darcy 💍 JESUS, JESUS, JESUS christ I ask that you protect 🙏 that which have joined together ❤
Morgan...
"All of these sorrys I don't owe you hunny" hits me so fn hard it makes me cry every time.
I'd never heard of him until today. I'm not much for country music. But I heard this song and was immediately hooked. He's definitely made me a fan.ive since listened to several songs tonight and I absolutely love his music. Dern never thought I'd like country music lol. I'm converted tonight. 💯❤️
Man this guy can turn something dark into something that sounds like a love song.
I am living this right now.
Beautiful song I love it
This guy auto tunes without auto tune.

My son found his 23 year old friend dying on the side of the road from a car accident. He has turned to drinking and other things to try and turn down the pain. Music helps him the most I feel. And as me and him drove down the dirt road he played me this song. Music is not just words. It’s a feeling! Pray for my baby.

I just found this song yesterday but I love the deepness in it and me and my husband are happy but everyone can relate to this tho
I'm always telling God "I'm sorry. I'm sorry." I can never please God. So I understand when you say "All those I'm sorry's I don't owe you." I don't see why God would want me apologizing all the time if He loves me.
10x better without the trap beat.
Wish my cousin Rog could of heard this song. He would of loved it so much. RIP:(

Wasted on someone that doesn't deserve me
bruh good song
Probably the only country song I ever liked
This song is amazing! Thank you Morgan for changing my view in country music ❤
Been with my husband almost 18 years straight 26 on an off and this song makes me feel all the pain my husband has put me thew an makes me wana let go of the fact he will never be the man I married again, and the new man he is isn't who I wana be with choosing to walk away is so hard
he's epic.
Legend has it his mullet is actually singing and he's just lip synching.
Back in April I had no clue who this man was.  My ex and I were together at the time and I bought us tickets to see him in concert after a big fight. We made up that night but I became a huge fan of his music after the fantastic show he put on. A month ago we filed for divorce and I swear his music cuts so deep but it's so good and so relatable.
This song speaks volumes to my soul🖤🤍
Good drinking and karaoke song 🎵 👌
For me this songs deep but my time was wasted on addiction that was my desire for many years. Thank God for his grace ,mercy, love, salvation and my sobriety 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽💯🔥🎤✔️🎵
Bro your one of my favorites keep making good music buddy
I ain't bob john by the way was eter jon before tho
Seems like not long ago we was joking around the fire n started drinking and vibing and boom we all opened up and came from all waring families and made something happen after that..
I'm on a repeat with this one. I was just stinking if you need another singer, bassist, or a guitarist hmu! I'd love to jam with y'all!
😍
Morgan we're all sorry. Wow you!
banger iam year late bruh
😎  Lauren Alaina is way way too~u^gly~ and gross to be part of any collaboration.  That's why she can't find anyone to sing with.  Nobody wants to be seen with her or sing with her in public, because she sings like a loser and looks like a fool.  She has a pathetic low life.  Kane Brown is the only person whom she can depend on, but his music career is falling apart too because of his pathetic, amateur, lousy performances at CMA awards.   He's not gonna last very long in music business either.   "Kane Brown and Khalid can't sing is an understatement".  They both sound like street singers begging for spare change in the street.  Terminate them from country music

Fire them asap..
To my head and these boots on my feet.. confusing me. What does that mean? It is a great song though
What did he do wrong?
Plenty of 🐟 in a singers SEA 🌊🌊🌊🌊
Thank you for this song it speaks truth
Someone definitely hurt him. Not only can you hear it in the way he sings it and clenching his teeth at times but you can also see it in his facial expressions....
This mans song has got me through more goddame shit then any other song well
Not a fan of country music… But when I hear one that grabs my attention well you know it’s a good song… I absolutely love this song… Definitely in my playlist and on repeat ❤❤
Hey mom and dad cheyanne Oklahoma city for free happy day tomorrow morning for you and you would love ❤ 😍 💖 ❣
This is my brother in law's COUSIN!!!
😍
Love this song
This song has been on repeat since my breakup. Has helped me tremendously .
Looks like I'm learning the hard way AGIAN, story of my life
Am I the only one who didn't realize he's doing the high pitched parts until now?
I love this song
This song is EXACTLY my life and the past 14 months of 100% lies, cons, theft, cheating, and more.
I cheated on my ex now she's trying to bury me fuck her I beggged her to come back but it's time to move on I repented for my sins
Beautiful truthful song...  Amazing... Truly...
Good night Morgan love ❤
Cheyannelove
Shit. This had me saying “ dayummm “ Morgan why you gotta break my heart when it’s not even broke? Flashbacks. I thought I was over it until I heard this. Jesus
That is no cap
This is the best country song in the f****** world
I honestly  wish her the very best I don't look at it as wasted  time or energy  you were just  a blessing  for the next  and hopefully the last woman  that will be on my life
Voice is so melodic
Super   de belle chansons
I just adore him and never listened to this genre

It's all my fault, yeah I dropped the ball
I don't always wake up in the mornin'  Pour myself a strong one  Aw, but when I get lonely I do  Your memory gets to burnin'  Lean back on the bourbon  Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you  Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again  It's all my fault, yeah, I dropped the ball  You're gone, and I'm gone three sheets to the wind  Thinkin' 'bout all  I've wasted on you  All of this time and all of this money  All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey  All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew  All them days I spent wasted on you  Wasted on you  Yeah, I swore this one'd be different  My heart wouldn't listen  To my head and these boots on my feet  Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again  That's why I've been  Wasted on you  All of this time and all of this money  All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey  All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew  All them days I spent wasted on you  Wasted on you  Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back  Right down to the flame of this match  Wasted on you  Wasted on you  Wasted on you  Wasted on you  Wasted on you  All of this time and all of this money  All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey  All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew  All them days I spent wasted on you  Wasted on you  Wasted on you  Wasted on you
Sometimes we have to be dangerous sorry.. I don't always wake up in the morning pouring myself a stone

Even tho she broke me to pieces i will always be thankful for the good times we had and how she made me happy. Even tho she may not deserve it.  hope she's doing good. Love this song keep up the good work. And !!!! Viva el amor!!!!

Tripping thought swore hackers edit song perfected thought last verse might be missing again wasted on u, waiting on u
You have the untouchable gift of grabbing people by their guts ! You'll never be finished ! Don't make a ballad , because that will be your peak ! Just keep being you ! Thank you, man !
Yvette,  if you ever read this I love you.  💕
Here we go.
He sings like every country I know.  😎
You are the reason why I like country music no I should say some country songs lol
My marriage is fading. No real love, no intimacy, we’ve become roommates. I’ve wasted all this time and my heart on someone who doesn’t truly love me. He doesn’t love anything but the alcohol.
Just a beautifully written song and incredibly performed. Wow
i love your music but UpChurch and you need to fight
Wasted on me I'm want to hear a girl sing the opposite of what he's saying the song could be grate
This isn't the version they play on radio...that one is awesome but this one is mf gd sob awesome
Great song! I love the music and lyrics!
I wanna be a young country singer and this is  inspiring.  Thanks big dog!!
Your the best
I miss my baddies, ya gurl needed this song always
Damn American women!  Monkey-branching, gold-digging whores. Every last one of them. Not an ounce of loyalty in these hoes.
It's just me now
Y’all’s comments so depressing
Thank you Mr. Wallen. You helped me through a break up just now. Here's to you🥃
Well this is automatically on repeat ❤️❤️
I wish I was Morgan's mom. I'd hug him and say, baby, how'd you get so smart?  ❤️😉
Morgan forever 🇺🇸⭐️🏆
Regina Galloway
my uncle always listens to this song now i love it lol
You should put all your songs on YouTube kids
God Bless Morgan. F woke Marren 🇺🇸
Cheers
Omg love this song and that mullet love it
YouTube. Time isn't wasted when ur getting wasted. My time was spent well w my x, even tho its done. We were 🔥! Toxicity!, I love it, I'll leave it alone for now.
This song is on repeat! Got me through some rough times. Thank you Morgan.
Not a huge Country music fan but seriously, when are the "Country Music Awards"?  U can really feel that his heart is in it by the sound of his voice & the lyrics should seriously be on a Hallmark card!
Best song ever
Not even a country music fan...but LOVE this song! Can totally relate to it...💕
Speechless. This song is amazing
His voice is so incredible and he's so handsome
💪🏻
It's time to take our lives back!  Too many of us have been hurt by the ones that we supported the most. It's time for me to live my life!
This man showed up in my recommendations 😂 he got me to love country
His voice makes me feel some kinda' way!
Dessicated to my best friend deputy Ronnie Johnson .. sucidial . Mentaly an depression. R.I.P

I’m not going through a break up but damn this song hits my soul! Singing to the top of my lungs no lie 😂
💚💚💚💚💚

12 years of him beating me and cheating. I'm done. I wasted years listening to excuses.
Beautiful song! Love this! ❤
I listened to this song 1st time today well now 47x and I get so emotional when I hear this beautiful song.
On my Chevy truck know with full blast lisening to this song loving it . 👊👌💯🙏
Me when my dodge be acting up.
Who is the guitarist who sings with him?!!!!!!???????? I can’t find it anywhere 😢
For all the younger gen out there…I’m talking 20s and such. Guys…life does not stop or slow down. There is always someone out there to fill your spot. Don’t waste your precious time that you think you have so so much of right now doing ignorant things. If you feel the slightest feeling in your heart or I’m your gut about what you’re doing…you may want to rethink it. I got in a mess when I was just a kid guys…around 12 or 13…I was doing stuff you wouldn’t believe. My childhood and a lot of my “adulthood” was wasted… I thought it was fun at the time,and it was to an extent…crazy fun. Then you grow up and it becomes a living nightmare day after day night after night. Before you know it you’re 40 years old wondering what happened to all that time. I will never get it back,I know that…I want so bad sometimes to be able to go back to 13 and know just one thing that I know now. But…everything happens for a reason,right? Keep your heads outta the gutter guys!  Godspeed!
I here u . its a great song 2 listin too. Great song to drink to? Better to just lisen too?
I don't really listen to country, but I rock with this song.
Omg hi I'm a fan and I watched the country music awards and I saw you and I passed out I love you so much 💗 I was so happy to see you and this November the 9th today I was so happy to see you on tv I cried I love you I've been listening to you for 8 years and I'm now 12 I hope you are doing well and I will see you in the next country music awards
Cant stop listening to this omg fire
I don't listen to country or anything closely related to it .. I'm a hardcore rap/Hip Hop guy but this shit is straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I completely relate to it
Going thru a divorce process 20 years its tough I was abused and just grab my purse and never looked back its super tough but being in icu every six months was too much this song pulls me out of dark hours thank u
I guess I can’t say I don’t like country anymore….this is tough!!
This song makes me think of my ex wife and how hard I fought for her and to break her away from her addiction and the day I finally tapped out and let her go then 3 short years later she’s gone lost her battle with the drugs and she sadly passed away from them.
You melt me with every word.. Beautiful MW
OMG me and my mom and my dad sing your songs even day😊😊😊
Mine left me for his co- worker after 25 yrs. Oh yeah, every word Mr Wallen sings says it to the tee.
May you prosper like Miley Cyrus
I think it's the best song ever
This song just gives you so much feeling.
Its a good song, but so very simple. Like 10 words on verse and the rest is chorus. lol Another one hit wonder
Before this song I didn't know my favorite country song until this came out love this Morgan
I love this song it makes me stay strong. I'm ending a 3 month marriage. My partner changed into someone I didnt marry.
In the process of Ending a 20 years relationship from a Narcissist.... LOVE THIS!!!! HEAR ME ROAR YES!!!!!👍✌️😎
8 yrs running around taking care a woman who can't even admit that she keeps hurting me. All that matters to her is herself. She keeps acting like I'm invisible to her when she has her male friend over like he is better then me but In my eyes He is nothing. Like who the hell would want that sack chasers. Fuck all that Im wasting my time on her
This speak too the 1s who really been there...
So deep even his back up feels it singing with him
I'm not even a country music fan, but this song grips me. I've got it on repeat. Makes me feel something deeply❤️
We now that music isn't dead. There is talent out there. Thank God your music found us Morgan. I personally never listen to country music, but this dude's voice has got me hooked. Sick beats too.
If you want the truth I don't like it.
Beautiful !!!!!!
I wasted 10 years on someone that didn't really love me at all. Now I have someone that loves me as much as I ever love her.
This hits different when you just realized your marriage failed
This isn’t a regular sounding country song.
They say no storage for our souls who are waiting. Happy day
I love this song so much
Number 1 on the country billboard for 3 weeks straight in Canada!! Incredible song Morgan....Thank you for you're awesome talent. Love from Canada 🤠🤩
Just ended a 6 year "relationship" and heard this gem in the car. Ive got nothing in life to be ashamed of but the time I wasted believing lies.
This shit hits hard when you've ruined years of your life for someone else.
This is my JAM!!! ❤❤❤❤
Finally, the song that plays on my bus.
Imcurrently going through a rough time with my boyfriend of 3 years and its just no matter what I do its never enough. I just dont get why Im going through this again.This song is literally how I feel😒
I know Many ppl have felt this way, in at one  or more relationships, some of us learn from it and others fall back into the same kind of  relationships that will never last. There are givers and takers, but to make a relationship last, there must be give in take from both sides.
All of these sorrys I don’t owe you That’s just hit different
I hear the song every morning I get up and put the song on
Not wasting
3 sheets to the wind . I relate
Best song ever
This man gets me through the 2 breakups I had 2 and 6 years ago

Just heard this song on Big Buck Country I live in Texas, I have gone Country .. I am your fan now .I love this song 😊😊❤️
🖤
Great song he says it all
Guess what is my favorite song country 🎵
7 years, it's my fault, should've put him out the first time.
After reading out some comments it came to realize me that in western Culture there is really nothing called real love life...To roam around someone's heart is really easy going matter & trust me just because of this reason heartbreaking issues r bread & butter... No values and honor to individual and Their mental necessity...
One thing bout me is when I find a song that is exactly what I'm goin through... I'll play it over and over again till it gets old 😭😭😭😭
I love this song so much 😭😭😭 I be screamin while singing it bc I love it so much
23 years he just threw away...why couldn't I be worth it!???
Yes the hard way again why
He wrote this song that many has gone through!
After a 30 plus marriage, this spells and tells it all. Cheating husband, with no intentions of leaving. I left. Been 4 years of total peace. I owe you nothing!!!! Wasted my time. Never againtoobligate myself to anyone
Story of my last decade plus some. So tired.
Pokémon and Morgan Wallen I am your biggest biggest biggest fan ever what day ever I will hope to see you at your concert and I’m seven years old I’m seven years old I just wish wish I could see you in real life have a  🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊
I love this song so much
I’m not a big fan of country till I heard this song. Now I dabble here and there to see what’s up. Country takes a while to like if you never grew up from this music. This guy makes it easy for others to listen and enjoy. Amazing talent !
Love ur hair and I see the pain when u sing  love the guitarist u can see y'all feel that
I just ended a one year relationship a few days ago. Two in abusive relationship. Sometimes I wonder why me other times it feels good to leave but other times it hurts. Sometimes I wish I could understand why
All of this time and all of this god damn money. Hits home.
nice voice
Hi
For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
Why do I always spend money on groceries Spend all day cooking  Especially when it's beef stew Beef tips get to brownin' Turn it to a simmer Thinking oh this will be good beef stew  Looks like were having left overs again It's all your fault I thought you were hungry You're crying and I'm crying too Thinking about all, this food wasted on youuuu.  Dedicated to my kids.
I’m not going through a break up and i normally don’t listen to country … this is one of my current favorite songs anyway. This version especially ❤
Great song!:)
If it wasn't for that girl he wouldn't be here signing today
This song is so true! I listen to it everyday!
This version on Spotify?
this song hits different than other country songs, this song is truth and tru heartbreak
Great song... wow
Damn, I love this song. Feels like it was made for me and my kids' mother. And drugs and alcohol. Lol
I listen to you every day man . Your the goat
8 years + with a malignant-covert narcissist.  All a waste... every moment.
Heard this on the radio😩😩😩 literally skipped the station and went back because it sounded so good
This song and many others have gotten to me on deep levels. Thanks so much and hope you blow up beyond many musicians.
I'd say drink it up Bob!!
Congratulations
He speaks to a lot of guys. But yet we're the problem somehow
Love this song so much!!!! Morgan.. You brought me back to country.    ❤❤
This has helped me so much that I want to say thank you 😊

Itz WALDEN.  NOT WALLEN
Just got out the ICU yesterday. I broke my leg and while there they found out I'm in liver failure. No more drinking unless I wanna die which I don't. We gotta stay strong guys. I'm only 38. Let's pray for each other y'all. Stay tough. We got this🌹🌹🌺🌺🌼🌼
This song is for my brother! Love you Brother 🐺!!
Late to the MW party…and I’m not leavin’ anytime soon!  I guess I’d just tossed his name in the baseball hat with all the other bro-country boys.  My bad. While 3/4 of his songs may be about drinking (that’s country music in general I guess) they are at least well-crafted and the gravel in his voice sounds like the backroads in my small TN hometown.  He’s Kenny Chesney, Tim McGraw and Chris Stapleton rolled into one💥💥💥
This gets me in the feels every time!
Glad you passed on the alcohol and I do too and simply enjoying music on a natural high and praying we will continue to enjoy music as it is playstation on our radios phones in our world. May you all enjoy music for hoe you enjoy it...🎼🎼💖🎼🎼
Awesome song! Love it!
I know this feeling but from the other side and believe me it hurts all the same maybe more
I guess I’m learnin the hard way again 🤷‍♂️
Country music always makes me want drink my sorrows away I swear, got this habit from my mom lmao
Mental illness is serious. I  want us guys to talk about it.. I would be willing to see you talk to me than hear about your funeral.wevhave to start talking. This song saved me. Times are hard but I'm even harder.
I sing this w my whole chest!! 💯💯💯💯🔥🔥✅
This song is good as shit
This song is good as shit
This song should have come with a warning. Once you hear it, you can’t stop listening. If I was his bartender, I would put the jukebox on repeat. I love this song! So glad Morgan Wallen came back to country music.
Trees
Loveeee this song ❤
this song hits hard
He should move away from the auto tuned, trap beat infested garbage and focus on more acoustic stuff. He is holding himself back with that.
You are a great storyteller ! Love your songs !
this guy is a racist he deserves the heartbreak
Love it 👊 Spray it many times 👊
28 years of marriage went up in smoke and didn't even see it coming. The true example of a fool. (Love is blind)
You owe me another life..
I love you!! Your amazing!!

🥰🥰
Good Morning Mr. WALLEN .   That T 😻
Super.
If u think that ok lol
Are
I don't listen to country but this song just Hits Different,gotta love it
Rug.zndjsh
Jskruvlshishsnaanvfpy
One of the greatest songs around right now!!!
Wow u can tell he felt this.
Kane Brown can't sing.   We don't want to see a tone-deaf person at the ACM awards, cuz his voice is not listenable.  Even my 6 year son can sing better than Kane Brown. Kane Brown is musically tone-deaf.   How is he still in music business?   How?   How can a tone-deaf person be a country singer?  Kane Brown has to be terminated from music business as soon as possible. Kane Brown is unable to distinguish between different pitches in tone or sound as he has trouble singing the right notes.  Kane Brown is unable to perceive differences of musical pitch.   He can't sing and is not even qualified as a singer.  He sings like a toddler with 0 emotion.  By the way I love every county singer except Kane Brown....... @Starbaby!    So, you get your commission from Kane Brown for all those fake comments and views in every Kane Brown's music videos!  Are you trying to impress/convince Kane Brown that you need more money?  Everybody knows Kane Brown can't have a descent stage performance at the ACM awards cuz he's tone-deaf.   Why are you keep coming back here?    Stop being needy and stop lying to the world!!.
I still have this aong on repeat...Brother you definitely deserve several grammys for this tune
All these country singer guys do anymore is cry over chicks. Where did all the outlaws go?
Great man  great songer,great lesson for many men and women
I'm an R&B/ Soul listener but this right here ....❤️❤️❤️❤️ This touches my soul cause it's relatable and real. Got it on repeat. Keep doing your thing Morgan !👏👏👏👏
When he sings this song, he looks like he is really feeling it. Wish this song had been out 1.5 years ago when a good friend and I ended our friendship. Yes, I mean you Peter J.
Watch out for the girl fans Morgan they are just in it for the game and money. I was a talent agent in Beverly Hills California. I also worked for Elite  Model agency. I know the games!
I feel like this can be a song about addiction, all this time I've spent drinking.
To all the girls I wasted my time on lol
This song heals my soul
I drive an f-150 but yeah i feel ya Morgan.
The acoustic just hits different, man. I'm not a fan of the record version but this? Oh my goodness, heavenly.
They don't play this song enough on the radio
2:01 is the best part omg 😍

I'm glad for Morgan's success. Being a talent agent for years l am particular. about the music l listen to. Morgan is a gift to country music .
Morgan wallen could sing the nation wide jingle and it would sound great
Why is this version not on spotify😭 i love this version so much more than the radio version. This one Mr. Wallen just has so much more passion in his words and it just makes you feel the song so much more! And i love the harmony runs!
Heartless is also a good one.
I play this song loud as hell when my husband makes me a little mad lol 😂
Will I ever learn my lesson?
Such a real song. Needed this song years ago!
Song on REPEAT!!!!!!! ❤
I love this song and I keep playing it over and over. This is how I feel he feels about me. The best feeling I had felt in a long long time and now it's all just a memory 🥺
Kane Brown can't sing.   We don't want to see a tone-deaf person at the ACM awards.  His voice is not listenable. Kane Brown is musically tone-deaf.  How is he still in music business?   How?   How can a tone-deaf person be a country singer?  Kane Brown has to be terminated from music business as soon as possible. Kane Brown is unable to distinguish between different pitches in tone or sound as he has trouble singing the right notes.  Kane Brown is unable to perceive differences of musical pitch.   He can't sing and is not even qualified to be a singer.  He sings like a toddler.  By the way I love every county singer except Kane Brown.  His voice is annoying. @Starbaby!    So, you get your commission from Kane Brown for all those fake comments and views in every Kane Brown's music videos!  Are you trying to impress/convince Kane Brown that you need more money?  Everybody knows Kane Brown can't have a descent stage performance at the ACM awards due to being tone-deaf.   Why are you keep coming back here?    Stop being needy and stop lying to the world...
😎😎  Lauren Alaina is way way too~u^gly~ and gross to be part of any collaboration.  That's why she can't find anyone to sing with.  Nobody wants to be seen with her or sing with her in public, because she sings like a loser and looks like a fool.  She has a pathetic low life.  Kane Brown is the only person whom she can depend on, but his music career is falling apart too because of his pathetic, amateur, lousy performances at CMA awards.   He's not gonna last very long in music business either.   "Kane Brown and Khalid can't sing is an understatement".  They both sound like street singers begging for spare change in the street.  Ban them from country music......
Great tune

I wish I could like this great song ❤😊
Miss her, but I gotta move on
Best country song ever. It is such a good song.
What a song.  Much prefer this version over the one with the hop hop drums
Anyone hear cuz this version is just better!!
I am from Brasil and love Morgam Wellen
Me to a T
Great!!!!!
The voice didn't know the hell what they were doing to not pick Morgan Wallen.
Amazing how a song resonates with you ❤️
Morgan is the man  !!!  He be famous today and famous when me -you - and Morgan when we’re all dead
I couldn't agree. One could definitely say he (Morgan) has definitely been through a horrible relationship
I've never been in love until I meet tanya when I lost her my whole world has been destroyed life has no meaning anymore
I Love this song cause, it hit’s HOME straight to my SouL ! 😭
Might tell my gf to leave me for a bit so I can feel this pain a bit harder 😢
Mr. MORGAN WALLEN        THANK YOU FOR THIS SONG.      Gets me through the tough as Fk times I’m going through. ❤🎣
East Tennessee born and raised!!! Everything you record is nothing short of amazing. I bump your music every day. Keep them coming the 865 is behind you brother.
Can I just say the back up sanger here with Morgan can sang his but off too the range in his vocals on his tenor parts are crazy...Sang it boys..
This is such a bad ass jam, ive been there and learned time takes time.
God he’s hot.
Such a beautiful sad song.
Makes me want to get my  heart broke so this hits even harder.
Only real country nowadays

Well i can officially relate alot to this song... All my time and money just to be cheated on...
It's not about the girl it's the time that I wasted on the person that I used to be
Wether you like country music or not...This is a banger!!! Love this damn song, dude is mad relatable.
One of the saddest songs ive ever heard but cant stop listening to it
Love him
This song 🎵 just started playing on the radio station in Connecticut that I listen 🎶 too...I thought it was a new song 🎵 and thinking it was Rascal Flatts....I Love ❤️ 😍 this song ....What a phenomenal voice 👏
Amen 🙏
My new favorite song ...thank you 🌹🤠
I miss you like a mofo and I should have left them concrete boys a lone! Lol
Jonathan merriett Ava mo
I love his music SO MUCH❤️❤️
I hate country and I love this song
and just like that,  I am sucked into an unexpected genre.
My husband, son and I drove from PA to Florida this summer and that's when this song became my all time favorite! Lot of time in the car and listening to nothing but country radio made the trip go by like nothing else! I belted out every word to your song cause it touched my soul! Since we have been back from vacation it is still my absolute favorite song and I belt it out every time I hear it! Told my husband that all I want for Christmas is tickets to see one of your shows!!!! I love your music🥰❤️❤️❤️👏
Tried twice myself learned the hard way left 2 months ago and last Friday bought a house for me and my kids haven't even heard from her other than when you gonna come get your tools
Be
I love this...
My biggest fear is that I’ll grow sick of this song after listening to it over and over again…in the car, at home, at work.
Will never get old
All I've wasted on you...  yep that's it!
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉g🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
dont be sorry
You just sang my current life. Beautiful.
Thanks man I needed this 💔
My family love you and your band ever since my mom and my dad broke up me and my dad listen
Morgan Wallen man I just wish one day we can make a song together
God- I love you.  Listening on r e p e a t.  #Legit <3 <3
Love this song
If you wish the song was longer, switch playback speed to .75 🙃
This song saved my life!
Let's goooo Morgan 🤘this is a %100 hit.
No what kind of music you like this song is great
Radio on
I love this song. When I find a song that applies to my life, it makes me humble. His music is far from typical country but every country fan is sure to relate😢
Love this version w the you-ooo-oooo-oooooo-woo-oooo
I love his voice… nice song !!!
Morgan Wallen- wasted on you [acoustic cover] #MorganWallen #acoustic #cover https://youtu.be/UX3Qwr2LkLU
Anyone know if the guitarist at the beginning is in standard tuning?? I can see first fret capo but it just isnt sounding quite right.
Usually don't even listen to(new country) LOVE THis!
Only reason I wish I was still married to my ex is that she may get money by being his cousin lol.
man's a beast!!!
Morgan Wallen, I'm literally in love with this song, I can even see the message coming from it. This song will change my life from now on. I wanna thank you and YouTube for making this song appear in my phone
Recently got out of something that I didn't even see coming. Luckily I would soon see , she wasn't who she pretended to be.     It wasn't even all that long and damn it came on fast but wound up thankfully done while I still stood strong and knew it couldn't last.
Evanescence’s wasted on you hits different though 😅
All them days I spent wasted on you… He has some throwback with haunting melody to Hank Williams 😍
Perfect for someone I know- and ❤ed ..
Is it weird that Morgan Wallen looks a little bit like BionicPIG?
Bro id yell the N word just cause i love saying it, stay strong brother.
That song is perfect, it's what I wanted to say.
All of these sorry’s I don’t owe you honey….. hits home here
The second singer look like he was having constipation problems lol love this song tho
I love you morgen I am your biggest
Love this song‼️
My favorite song on constant repeat.
I’m singing this at the top of my lungs staring at my boyfriend even though we have the best relationship ever.
Mr. Wallen, Morgan bonjour mi amore'..Hello! If you decide you're going to sing the ingredients of a shampoo bottle. Which one would you choose dude, sir? Also, if and when it becomes a huge sensation, can I please be in the music video t.y.s.m. I ❤️U!!..Sir, I'd choose a more lucrative brand myself, maybe even a dandruff shampoo. ( f.r. ) I for sure would never, not intentionally Morgan, mister "wasted on you". (lather, rinse, and repeat?) 🚿... xoxoxo!  🤫Shhhh, I'd waste it on "you"...Aurvoir "snowflakes"..
I don't even like country music but, this song right here, I just Love!!! Ist for me!!
I love Morgan Wallen
This is the version that should be on the album.  Ditch the rap 808 beat.
OMG, grate song!!!
Это шикарно. По совету "Заточки"
Awesome voice!  Don’t date women who grew up on Barbie dolls @ and women shouldn’t date guys who understand chevy cars!  Lol!
Love Dangerous Sessions of Wasted On You
This is one for the guys...all of the sorrys I dont owe you honey
any more songs like this im absolutely obsessed
Best song for my kids that hate me ! Love it
Look on the bright side. He's making back some of that money off this song 😭
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Finally a break up song that isn't all sad and makes you hate yourself for losing that special someone you lost....this speaks to the reality of a break up
Let’s keep in mind here, one of my favorite country singers is Darius Rucker. Yes he is a different color however that does not occur to me. It’s OK not to like somebody as long as you do it for the right reasons They’re not racially motivated and if you don’t like that statement you can kiss my ass. Morgan Wallen is also amazing!!!!!👌👍😀
Honestly, coming from a man that proposed to a woman, and now seeing what I actually mean to her and her family. This song is what I needed...cause my next move sucks...8 years...thank you brotha I needed this....
Cheers to all my sad boys 🍻
Love this song💯
I used to listen to hardcore rap music about killing and drugs then I got a little older and realized I felt embarrassed to even play it loud. This is the music I can feel proud to hear a loud and say I love country music.
Word
Don't we all have sores I don't owe you honey
Sure as hell can’t keep leaning on you…..
He have really a good voice beautiful
Sur nuff you are country an I will always enjoy you don't never stop plez love your fan Sunshine 🔆
Love this song is my favorite song morgan ❤️❤️👍👍
Still my favorite song.
I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Aw, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets to burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault, yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone, and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinkin' 'bout all I've wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen To my head and these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again That's why I've been Wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you
I think this is better stripped down with just him, a guitar and some fred from the studio
Oh so beautiful... Listening it again and again. Somehow this song can touch your heart, even though you have no related story in the background
Jonathan merriett Ava mo
This song is awesome. I catch myself thinking about life and relationships. This song helps me when I hear it. Thanks Morgan.
Is he singing to a woman or a bottle of alcohol?
I've been wasted on you been all of this time and all of this money all of the sorries I don't know you honey days I've been wasted on you wasted on you wasted on you wasted on you
I have Ben singing This song All day I can't get it out of my head
I have Ben
I used to like this song but my wife play it so much , I’m starting to think this song is secretly dedicated towards me lol
😭 come back to me.
Most artists don't sound the same live u sound awesome
I bet Morgan wallen  don't even know how good his voice is. He started out with a horrible  voice
Ive been practicing for three days straight to sing this and man i learn so much how fun singing is, this song will forever be in my heart, and as a person that cant sing well, this song certainly helped me, thank you and keep up the great work 🙏😇
Talent talent talent and a good team!
All of this time, and all of this money. All these sorries I don't owe you honey.  Just one example of why I love and do music. When someone says something so clearly. It helps you make since of what you're going through more then you ever could! Never been a fan of country. Country got a new one now!
💝❣️💕❣️💕❣️💕💝
Cheers to the absolutely perfect backup singer
Forgiveness -Prager University, And this song..
Thanks for putting these words into this song. I couldn't have said it any better.
All of these sorry's I don't owe you honey...so much wasted smh
This song in particular I love so much. Its so good and no one will ever understand how much i relate to it and love it. I've listened to it so many times and will continue to do so. <3
heads up boys plenty of fish in the sea
The damn prayers in the pew were even wasted?! WHAT THE F?!!! I’m like… 🤯… Yet… here I go to the pew!! HHAAA! Instant Timeless Classic!!
my favorite song in the world thank you for beautiful music
the pain in his face tells it all.
I love this.
I want to hear Cartman sing this to Kyle. 😆
Right about the time she left I kept hearing this song everytime I turned on the radio. I took that as sign. I'm glad she's gone. Finally feel like I can breathe again
Always love this song thank you for YOU 🔆
I as well and an addict... alcoholic biotch...I hate this shit and in early recovery... trying to make it through the steps...still relapse but still reaching out so I can be who everyone else sees me as when I don't even know myself yet...my daughter told me to listen to this song and I never usually go out on the comment side...but I know I have to if I want to live and have my family and keep my most awesome boss in the world who gave me a second chance at my job after being a bleeeep up 😅 I believe in you and I believe that if you reaching for the branches...ur looking up instead of down 6 ft under. Peace love and prayers whomever needs to take this in as well
❤
To all women 🤣🤣
This song is so good
I love this song
💥💥💔💯
SPECTACULAR TEARS
Real life
I dont know what it is but this man, this song makes me want to mend that broken heart. Phew...
I love that he writes his own music. Anyone can sing, but real talent is writing your own song and singing it flawlessly.
L
I stopped listening to rap once I heard this song💯
This song swept me off my feet. The message is powerful and somehow comforting. Blasting it in my truck right now 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song has gotten me through the hardest break up.  It touched me to my core. Thank you Morgan, I’ve listened to this song more times than I can count
14 years together. My entire adult life. 6 years married. 2 kids. I tried so hard to be what she needed. To do right and make it right when I was wrong. Then she tells me "I haven't loved you since 2020" . We have a 9 month old I know is mine. How does that work? Now I'm walking away with nothing but debt and no home so they can have everything they need. This song is me. I love this song but I hate me. I was never enough.
Cheating sob
I love this version. The one that was released just doesn't hit the same.
When I listen to this song it makes me think so bad
Why did someone just dedicate this song toLmfao to me
😎😎  Lauren Alaina is way way too~u^gly~ and gross to be part of any collaboration.  That's why she can't find anyone to sing with.  Nobody wants to be seen with her or sing with her in public, because she sings like a loser and looks like a fool.  She has a pathetic low life.  Kane Brown is the only person whom she can depend on, but his music career is falling apart too because of his pathetic, amateur, lousy performances at CMA awards.   He's not gonna last very long in music business either.   "Kane Brown and Khalid can't sing is an understatement".  They both sound like street singers begging for spare change in the street.  Fire them.

SUPERB LIVE!!!  Even more impressive than the recorded version!!  A great "guy" song!!  Heard this playing while standing in Starbucks waiting for an order. Never heard it before.  It IMMEDIATELY got my attention with the hook "WASTED ON YOU," so I easily found it on YouTube.  A classic in its own time!!  :)
Has a Rascal Flatts sound on this song
But I Learned yes I did
This is still my favorite song ❤

I'm loving this song. The background reminds me of silent hill at times oddly enough.
Morgan wallen is the best song maker ever in history.
The GOAT. Love you my dude.
"Yeah I swore this would be different, my heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet"  That line hits me so hard everytime 💔 ugh
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow, I love this song, deja vu🥰❤❤❤

I love me some Morgan Wallen. The mullet not so much. How many other Asian country fans are there? I've been to a shitload of concerts and only saw one other in 10 years. We gave each other the nod, though.
I fell in love with someone with a bad addiction. This song says it all. They can bring you down with them.
👩👩👩👩Lauren Alaina is so disgusting to look at.  Even Kane Brown doesn't want to be seen with her or sing with her.😅😅😅😅😅😅

Why don’t you owe sorry’s if it’s all your fault?

Yeeeees😍😍😍😍

Nobody wants to be seen with her or sing with her in public, because she sings like a loser and looks like a fool.  She has a pathetic low life.  Kane Brown is the only person whom she can depend on, but his music career is falling apart too because of his pathetic, amateur, lousy performances at CMA awards.   He's not gonna last very long in music business either.   "Kane Brown and Khalid can't sing is an understatement".  They both sound like street singers begging for spare change in the street.  I feel sorry for them...
❤❤❤❤❤
Me too @ Kevin D. Sober 12/2/88...One Day at a Time
1:52
I want to get sober but I dont😓 lol dammit.
The conviction in his voice when he says “All of these sorry’s I don’t owe you honey”
Got 72 days clean and just was told to listen to this .thank you for this kick ass song and strengthened my recovery... got another 24 can't stop won't stop
Keep up the good work!!! I'm proud of you
What a beautiful song well done man seriously 👏
I didn’t know Morgan was only 1 year older then me
I'm happily married and my husband and I love this song 😍 Maybe it's past relationships or maybe it's just good music. 👍🏽
He'll yeah 🇺🇸🙌🤘
💕🌼🔥🎵🎶🎶🎵..ily
"All these miles on this Chevy" just driving to find a cure or a better place. Felt that

Not a big country music listener, but love this!!!
Now who in the hell can't relate to this song pass that bottle
Sound like he’s bringing real country music back 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Real Deal for sure. I'm 52 and was born and raised listening to country. Love this guy. Awesome, genuine and incredible artist. You are very blessed. Keep them coming brother and visit AZ
All of these miles on this Chevy !! I felt that
❤️❤️
Yo harmonies were on point!!! As a lead guitarist I know how hard it is to do that, and dude killed it
sounds like the same bass line as "dont forget me" RHCP but this shit hits
Morgan Wallen is the man. Every time he comes on the radio in the shop we crank it up and jam. He always has us TN boys singing and rocking out
man Morgan wallen just can't miss... great song great artist. where was this song when my ex and I broke up 5 years ago
I just went through my first breakup. Luke Combs and Morgan have helped me heal, even though I cry to every song.
Last time I checked your name was Morgan walker
Dude get some Botox. Your eyebrows look like 2 catapilars fighting.
don't always wake up in the morning, pour myself a strong one, although... memory gets to burning, LEAN BACK ON THE BURBON
This song hits hard
All these sorry's I don't owe you honey.  Love it!

Love This SONG Since It Came Out!! WILL NEVER Get Old! 😁🙂🙃

I was touched by this song on the way home from work thanks.
I love this song
The struggle is real✌💕
I'm not really into newer country or country in general for that matter but this song is bad ass.
No fucks to give. Hey be polite... ok sorry no sorrys to give
i’m trying to go with this song but i slip so bad , wanna reach out but i just drink
Man it's so subtle just listen to the music no words it's all there but then u bring the lyrics in like some old johnny cash  not ur style of singing but still the music brings him back, n then u come in just dam dude ur the greatest  the epitome of country break up music love u dude
Best break up song ever
Love this song
<3
I watched this song 500 times
I’ve never been a country song, but this one hits different…. Very good song
the fact they dont play this version on the radio instead...
I might just start liking country music because of this song. I actually hear the pop mash-up on the radio and I was immediately drawn to his voice. Look forward to finding other songs by this man.
I’m embarrassed just reading these comments please……
I'm naming my son after you
This song really hits home in a female perspective! Time Wasted except for my wonderful son that came out of it!❤️❤️. Love this song!! ❤️. Crank it up every time I hear it!!
What i love about this song is that it can be interpreted in many ways.  The sorrys i don't owe you honey can be a personbm or an addiction depending on your personal life journey
Totally fitting wasted my time on several fake a** #TIMMCGRAW PROFILES! All I can do is pray
Found out my husband cheated on me. We have two small kids together. My heart is shattered, gave it my all. Been listening to this song to get through it.
Forever gonna be obsessed with him and his voice.. 🤩💗 Keep doin what you do!
Every song is about alcohol
I can relate to this song so much ❤️❤️
i wrote this song🙄
This song says it all!! Yes!! Wasted on you! See ya!
Heard this song by accident. Looking for a me country white boy w a touch of soul now 👀🥰😍😁💁🏾‍♀️
Are you coming bk to I hope so
Stuck in my head 🔥🔥🔥
Hi Sexy Tom  Thinking about you already today.  Happy Monday Lover😃
What a beautiful song
I'm so Eric idk what else I cam do for you to love me and give me the unessasary action I need I can't help it I just need a lot of kindness and love like I'm giving you
So much time is wasted on everybody
Maybe you don't love me Eric like you said but i love you maybe nobody does it's okay I love myself
I love this version so much more than the original. I feel this song towards my ex/bf whatever he is. 6 1/2 yrs of my life wasted. Took care of his while his baby momma is living under a bridge addicted to everything.. but he can't give me the decency of feeling confident in our relationship since COVID.. swear he drags me back just for help with his kids
One oh your best song ever.
Big banger
My fav
I don't listen to country but this song is banging!
I feel this song in my soul. So how I feel. Luv this song.
Pretty 😎 cool Boys like it .
Anybody know what the hell a chevy impreza is?   Something so simple ruins the whole song
Dude that was fantastic
Great song...beautiful
I just like his mullet
Just letting remember. I didn't realize what I was Blessed with when I had it. I'm going get my man. It's never too late. You didn't waste time in that Chevy Baby. Love you Always

Omgosh!!! Love it! Morgan Wallen damn sure got it right with this song!!!! I'm definitely getting this album! This man is super real & I'm pretty sure he writes his own music! Not many artists can say that. Life experience sets in real when you been down that highway wondering "wtf!!" . Right after a drink when you realize what a waste of oxygen your last bf/ gf was!!
why wont my volume go past 100
Great job I love it
Such a great song. I love this so much

Great song. You sure are a little pussy though.
This song got me through a rough break-up..... Although it stings I know it was the right decision
My relationship in a song.,thank you man
This hits so close to me. I feel like I'm so lost. And I don't feel human anymore. But I hear this and it helps
I will never forgive Morgan for making my son want a mullet 😤😜 Also I'm addicted to this song rn.
This song doesn’t last long enough
I love you so much I have listened to all of you song I can how many times
God,  am I really married to lucifer? I know that we match physical now,  but I really don't remember matching when we were supposed to be married.  I go to lengths for him.  And he really doesn't treat me like a wife.  So please answer me so I can understand.  I will keep an eye out.  In Jesus name amen
I went to his concert and it was amazing
This song will always be my favorite I turn it all the way up in the car when it comes on!!
Love is over rated. Fall in love and find out the hard way.
I absolutely love this song.
Wasted on you
I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Aw, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets to burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you  Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault, yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone, and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinkin' 'bout all  I've wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you  Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen To my head and these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again That's why I've been  Wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you  Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you
Like so many others, the message strikes me hard but, saved me just the same. Still clean and sober!
I was gonna drink but I did so he’ll yeah
Its no Chente but ill fucks with it.
Thanks for making a break up much easier!
These lyrics feel real when u are going through real shit!!!
John 3:14-18 NIV  Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him.” For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.
There was no Chevy, no bourbon,  I'm not three sheets in the wind , time wasn't wasted[ ?] Heart is broken 💔  But yes. Learn the hard way, I owe myself sorries.
Wow i never thought I’d be able to relate to this song so much until last week fuck that bitch throwing 10 years away like it was nothing hopefully her fuck boy boyfriends can deal with her damn attitude. Wish i never wasted my time on this bitch only thing I’m grateful for are the 2 kids we had together.
Country loves songs have gotten me through every break up I've ever had. I can't get the emotion out without it
It’s been almost two weeks since the girl I loved broke my heart, told me her father forced her to or go to military school. I think it was a lie to get with another person. Within 4 days, she had broken up with “her soulmate” and found someone new. I believe  she did wrong but I feel like I did something wrong, I’m trying to move on, but I see her in my dreams. I loved her, but it hurts me to think about her, but she’s always on my mind. I know she used to love me, but I guess she lost feelings for me. I had never been happier than when I was with her. I still love her, and she told me that if we still have feelings for each other after high school, she will get back with me. Sad part is, I don’t think after high school will happen. I feel like a part of me is missing. And when I get to thinking about her, I tell myself she betrayed my love, and listen to this man’s songs to try to feel better, but nothing is working. Since then, I’ve had a constant heartache, I’m failing every class, and I have two classes with her where I’m sitting less than 3 feet from her, and the song that reminds me of what has happened to me, is band aid on a bullet hole. Thank you, Morgan wallen for making me feel a little bit better.
<3
Its amazing how many people you talk for... read a lot of comments in this thread....some of you probably got really good songs too!  lets hear them!
Morgan could sing the ingredients on the back of a cereal box 📦  and it would still be 🔥.
I bought the double Album and you can just hit shuffle and let it go.... never hear a bad song.
Thank you this is my favorite songs I dace to it every day😍🐶🐱😇😌☺
push play and repeat....❤✌🎶🎵
Yesssssssss I found it❤️
This song has probably saved my life a few times the last  few weeks 😔 ❤️
I’m obsessed
I don’t like country music but I really like this song
My son just went through a break 💔 up and I found this song for him it made him cry when he didn't want to and she told him that she cheated on him and he tried to hurt himself but didn't thanks for this good song
가슴을 후벼파네! 노래 너무 좋다~~
Sick Morgan. Your guitarist is a beast! Playing AND blending with your voice so well. Kudos to the soundman as well 🤌
He is a wonderful singer!  Nice song.
Best one yet
Damn old school
Him and Quinn Ewers are twins. Lol
Any alcoholic or addict can understand this song on a different level.
I no four of your songs
Go to mcewen pnd aging but I dine t get to go
Don’t usually listen to country but this different
LOVE THIS SONG
Really hits the heart in life
Much appreciated
Modern Kenny Rogers
И мелодия и голос
Чудесно!!!
Nice song 🎵  congratulations 🎊 👏 💐 🥳 👍  great  talent   beautiful  voice ❤️  sweet
he bin hurt bad look at how bad he looks
Just got out of a very abusive relationship, this song hit me hard straight to the core . This song took my breath away , listen to over and over .16 months later and still feel the pain .
Just amazing
THIS IS MY FAVORITE COUNTRY SONG RN
A part of me wishes it was me that broke his heart because this song is amazing, and he really sings it, dang!!
I LOVE this song so much!!!
I'm right there with you I love all his music 🎵🎵🎶🎶
American Badass - The ephihaby of overcoming this woke cancel culture society!
I love the lyrics  are from your  heart
Even when we were talking 😀 lol she just jojowe
I've never wanted someone to sing to me so dang bad.
So good! 🥰
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU ROSE.  I AM SO IMPRESSED WITH MORGAN'S SINGING...IT IS TOTALLY HIM AND NOT JUST ANOTHER ELVIS IMATATOR!!!!  ALSO HIS ACTING IS AWESOME......KEEP IT UP....WE ARE ALL WAITING FOR YOU IN ANOTHER MOVIE!!!!
Idk why I can’t think of it but what country song popular in the 2000-2008 does the first few cords sound like? I can’t think of it 🤣
Hey I sang this song at the first bar fundraiser I’d been too in Magnolia Beach Texas and got my ass jumped by a Bunch of good ole FAT BOTTOM girls. My voice must have been making their husbands drool at the bar. I sang it for you Morgan because your my hero.
0)
same
after that whole racist thing I was iffy about him but love him now album was iffy but it was ok
This is how I feel about every relationship I've had...
My favorite song rite now! Such a breath of fresh air !! Luke C. And.  Walker 😎🦾 Lfg !!  Duo please 🙏
Definitely wasted on you 🚮🔥
cool intro.. ummm Jeter never hit homeruns! thx bruuuuuu
I heard this song and I can hear the pain, I am now going through,  thank you Morgan, now if you could just sing him back to me I can finally put this bottle down.
I absolutely love your voice and this song. 💯❤️🔥😘 I like this version better than the studio version. 💯
A new favorite artist love this guys voice.
https://youtu.be/eEhJfq5pvjQ
I never heard him but he good
Morgan your just the best
Like that walk up. As for the waste, the hurt and the sorrow... not worth another second. There very well is life after death but, as far as you or I are care concerned, living in the present, this is the one. Don't waste your feelings or your precious life being hurt by someone who didn't give a shit about you when it counted.  Gonna play this song cause I love the riffs but I'm done crying... gonna change the lyrics.
Love this song. Only one thing, going 360 away is going in same direction.  Our education sucks. 🤣
BROOOO this isnt something some nashville countrty song writer wrote.... you can tell by his facial expressions he went thru some shit
This is my neighbors favorite song… whether they like it or not!!!!
Me to booze and me. 4 months and counting
Wack
He's so adorable, and his back up singer and guitar player needs huge credit too. I love the smirk he has at the end, because they know they killed it...Those eyes.
going through a nasty divorce right now.....she filed for divorce, i stepped out with another woman, then my current wife put her hands on my kids and i have full custody of my 12yo daughter.... i play this on repeat. she asked me one day," that about mom?"............ This helps keep it together.....
Best lyrics in a song....wow,and that voice...PERFECT!!
Girl you dont know  How much I truly loved you  Too bad you didn't share the same vision. But it's ok we all dream differently  Hope you catch your dream to come true My dream was truly was you
Beautiful song ♥️
GOAT
Man this boy is good
What makes this so good is not just the lyrics. It’s the pain in his voice you can feel the experience. And even deeper cut are the cords themselves just the raw feeling they project is so visceral. It doesn’t get much better folks.
The time I have wasted being depressed is a stupid amount.
don't worry about the time worry about the money and then the forged credit cards
Always thought he was overrated but holy shit this is amazing
Love this song
Who's idea was the damn drum beats? This is a million times better than the album version.
Love
I just went thru my whole age progression and cried
I've never cheated on any woman in my relationship even my wife I've never cheated on nobody ever why do women always cheat even when they have the man of the dreams who doesn't want anybody but them it still happens
ily morgan
i love this song 100%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Wooooh #DAMN yo.🤧✌🏾💥💥🎛🔉🔊🔊Thank you Mr Morgan 🙏🏾 Thank you. 🍾🥃
Id like to send my ex this song. And the song. In june i think about you!!
They play this in florida. 93.3. Thats where i heard it. Great song Morgan!!
Its a good song!lets learn better!  But that comes with age. Not my first Rodeo!!
This is about exes... but it could relate to many things. Drugs, Cars, Motorcycles, People, Job... the list is almost endless.
I love how passionate he is about the song
love u
This is the song to my job
Well somebody needs to tell him how to treat the cops that he uses and needs when he's doing his concerts, cause he's a pretty anal asshole when it comes to that

I’m 57 and a hard core classic Rock, Singer song writer, 70s early 80s music fanatic. Except for a few songs here and there I thought music was dead and gone forever. This guy gives me great hope and stands out above all others. His voice, his heart felt deliveries and lyrics are next level. It’s been years since someone like him has come along! Saw him in Hartford Connecticut and the energy was off the scale the entire Show. He’s amazing and I will be waiting for him to come back to the Northeast. I will drive hours to see him👍.
damn i felt this
I love country music got tired of rap even all my friends and family  even know it now that’s all I play now country and alternative,some rock never been into heavy metal and old school rock
August 2022 obsessed with this song
They tried to cancel you but love you now. You absolutely RIDE
Thank you
i love this song 😇😇😇
"ALL OF THESE SORRYS I DONT OWE YOU HUNNY" ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SONG
Definitely on repeat
mmmmĺĺpkoiiioi777iuu98y666.  oiuuoiiiììiiiio
#breakups
I am always talking about us older folks sharing with the kids songs but when yoyr child shares new artist its a gift take a listen like she gave me this artist i learn from her. #teenssharemusic #sharingmusic #musicheals
non Tammy Lee
I love your songs man three years ago my ex left me for another guy and started a life with him and its done nothing but hurt me but everytime im drunk at 10:50 or 3 am it always helps me thought it so thank you
Why ain’t u coming to South Carolina soon..come on over to the country !!! Hope all this time and all this money ain’t wasted on you.. love ya man !! Rock on!!
Can’t be cancelled ❤️ love this song
I never fw country but this song I love ❤️.
This song helped me when I was down and thinking of ending it all... thank you Morgan for saving my life. If it wasn't for this song I wouldn't be here today and all because of a chick that I thought was my everything. This song definitely hits hard and I will continue to jam this song for a long time.
This acoustic version is better than the radio version
ILove you're videos so much 💗
Great Song!!!
My favorite song
My name is also Morgan!
All of these prayers on a pew oml who broke 💔 his ❤ heart
Had to look up the lyrics bc Ive totally been singing "Chevy Impreza" instead of "Chevy and prayers" hahaa I was like Impreza is a weird choice for any song, buy def a country song🤔🙃😎
Love this song !!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Going through a break up this song is so true
😎😎  Lauren Alaina is way way too~u^gly~ and gross to be part of any collaboration.  That's why she can't find anyone to sing with.  Nobody wants to be seen with her or sing with her in public, because she sings like a loser and looks like a fool.  She has a pathetic low life.  Kane Brown is the only one whom she can depend on, but his music career is falling apart too because of his amateur, pathetic, lousy performances at CMA awards.   He's not gonna last very long in music business either.   "Kane Brown and Khalid can't sing is an understatement".  They both sound like street singers begging for spare change in the street.  I feel sorry for them
Kevin gates no time for that
Morgan what a beautiful song brother how you doing bro thanks for making such good song God bless take care . Sincerely mustangboy
The song is helping me get through a breakup right now I just keep picturing that face and saying this to him
I actually heard this song on my local Top 40 station this past Monday. Left me scratching my head because they rarely ever play country on "Y100". But, I've always liked Morgan Wallen so I didn't change the station.
I’m a Nigga 🙃
Proud of you Kevin Durant
Morgan Wallen is the only reason I came back to country music 🎶
i am a diehard EDM fan and love rap too. Absolutely despise 99 percent of country music but when it hits it fuckin hits. And i absolutely love this song
amazing country singer
Dam he's amazing!
I freakin love Morgan Wallen. Just saw him at the TidalWave Festival in AC and he was amazing!!
Sucks
I usually don’t like country and my friend told me this song was amazing, I thought she was crazy I will admit it’s not that bad
Can dedicate this one to the soon to be ex wife 🤣
Real singers sound better live and this man is a real singer.

You are the best thing to happen to country music💋
That's the USA that i loved as a kid.God bless country people ,god bless USA ,much love from Greece!!
I’m more of a hip hop / rap / pop fan, but I appreciate Morgan Wallen and this album so much it might just be the best country album in my opinion
This song is classic
Love it such a kick ass song
My and my nana and my  friends mom and friends love your music
Wasted soooo many years thinking and loving the wrong person!! Turned my life up-side down and it was a waste of time!
I seen my ex man today, I was driving out of town, it hurt to not b right beside him. Isly. Big sexy. Ur the man who has my heart, even tho we shouldn't b together.
This ones up there with the classic country ones like Tenesse Whiskey, Right beside it. 👐🏽
Song this to my wife how she makes me feel only thing we got out of our relationship is are kids sad but true
Wasted 4 years with a lying abusive cheating man. Less than a year after we broke up I am engaged to the best man I’ve ever met and regret all the time and money and sorries I wasted on my ex.
MY ❤️ WOULDN'T LISTEN 🎶

Yet another example of "Trashville" rip-offs! Where should I start? Ever heard of Jelly-Roll? Nashville is NOT country music! This kid should be ashamed of himself!
Anh hát bằng cả trái tim bảo sao mà cứ ngọt lịm như vậy. Bài nào cũng cảm xúc luôn
Amazing one of a kind voice!! Love it!!
💜
Love this!
Remember when Upchurch Upchurched and did your remix better than you.... ALL OF THAT TIME AND ALL OF THAT MONEY WASTED... When He took ya to church ⛪ and 💩 all over ya... did it faster, did it better
No one's probably going to read this, so I'm just going to spill out my heart here for a second.  A year and a few months ago, my Ex I fell deeply in love with for 5 years that I got myself together for, worked hard for, and single handedly moved us into a State she wanted to move back to where she wanted to be again and was truly happy at years prior behind a promise just to see her smile past all my fears and anxieties. Ever since she told me we would, "never ever be together again" I fell into the bottle to quiet the voices after I got her on her way safely. I've been blaming myself for the entire thing, the moment something doesn't occupy my brain elsewhere again. Living day to day with a fake smiling mask all while failing to fall asleep with nothing but guilt in my stomach even into my current relationship in fear of telling her the truth of this gut feeling... You can't just forget 5 years of fantastic memories that made you a man. But, as I sit here and listen to this on repeat on my way to work; I've finally come to grips with it all and accepted I'm not entirely at fault and shouldn't take the blame because she wasted /my/ time when all I tried to do was help from the very beginning.  TL;DR I'm not even a Country fan, but this song definitely made me feel a million times better with my situation, thanks, Morgan. You've helped this soul move on.
so good
I'm listening to this song right now and it gets to me.i just started seeing this chic and I got the same old BS I love you I won't lie to you or cheat on you.but this last past week she has been BN shady so I have not went through the break 💔 up yet but today it's going to happen.im getting out before it hurts to much more than it will already.i was single for 5 years an just been working my ass off and saving money an bought a new truck an learning to love myself and then I might her an I'm more miserable now then I was BN alone.i would rather have the money 💰 then the love at least I don't get hurt.
He's got all of this at such a young age. Keep it up Morgan!!!!
Sounds like something jelly roll would write and sing
Thank god this song plays on the radio now. I just blast this in my car and want everyone to be blessed by Morgan's voice.
How many f****** Liars equate this with their sobriety human trash stop lying
Love this Song!
😎😎  Lauren Alaina is way way too~u^gly~ and gross to be part of any collaboration.  That's why she can't find anyone to sing with.  Nobody wants to be seen with her or sing with her in public, because she sings like a loser and looks like a fool.  She has a pathetic low life.  Kane Brown is the only one whom she can depend on, but his music career is falling apart too because of his pathetic, amateur, lousy performances at CMA awards.   He's not gonna last very long in music business either.   "Kane Brown and Khalid can't sing is an understatement".  They both sound like street singers begging for spare change in the street.  I feel sorry for them
Got me soo hooked in this song everyday I am dancing in my kitchen lol love it!!!
The words of this song are real life and probably touch alot of listeners life.Great Talent

Wasting your money
I am addicted to this song
This song makes my heart beat fast, I think of my daughter who is struggling with addiction , she has been going on 15 years now, she used to be my little girl , and now I can't recognize the person she has become,  my heart aches for her to be happy, and have a happy life, no parent should or anyone should have to deal with the pain and destruction drugs cause
Yep
Cool mullet dude.
Love this song. Wish the one played on the radio had the vocalizations on the chorus- my favorite part.
On repeat
My bf told me if we break up this will be his break up song. He’s been playing it on repeat tho. Should I be nervous 😂😂😂

THIS SONG WILL FOREVER BE ONE OF THE BEST SONGS EVER MADE. NO DOUBT. ITS A TRUE MASTER PIECE. MORGAN WALLEN FOREVER MAN.
Imagine being in a Chevy Empreza and then this song comes on 🤠 🔊 🎶
Everything in this song I relate to.. except the money part I was a broke ass for the last year, couldn't work because I needed a surgery.
I fell in Love with an asshole.. This song hits the nail on the head. Except I put a lot of miles on my Toyota. 💔
I love this song thanks for the shareing

can we get a new top comment. good vibes
Hey u no what Morgen Wallen this is my best song
I just found this dude the other day..I had to get away from country for a while.. big change from Chicago and New York drill lmao.  This has got to be my favorite song from him.  Reminds me of my ex, wasted 15 mf years and who knows how much money.. I don't care about the money,  I can't get the time back... truthfully I don't even want the time back,  I still love her, and I miss her... all I got left of her is the memories, sometimes memories ain't enough
# I LOVE THIS SONG ...I PUT IT ON REPEAT 💯💯💯
one of the best country songs ever
I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Aw, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets to burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault, yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone, and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinkin' 'bout all I've wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys' I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew, all them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen To my head in these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again That's why I've been Wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew, all them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys' I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew, all them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you
I have wasted my whole life on a man who abused me in every way possible. This song hits hard

I don't even like country but omg this song is too good
I swear to you guys I'm almost always a heavy metal/ devil 👿 music guy.  I've also been playing guitar for 22 years now. But this song is something else and I can feel it in my soul.  And it rings true so many times in every situation and relationship that I can't deny how important it is for us all to listen and listen again.  I'm astonished.
wasted 24 years of my life with you
Omg its Morgan
I totally feel seem way- him and Chris Stapleton those rich voices so Yummy
Went through a really bad breakup in June and struggling with mental health issues. I stopped walking and froze when I first heard the lyrics

I love you darlin ur the best...Luke Combs,Eric Church and you Baby 🤭
Stupid so g
I've got the hiccups
your bad at singing
This song describes my 12 year marriage I ended a couple years ago. I stayed with someone who treated me like sh*t, abused me, screamed at me daily,  used me for money...and left me nothing in the end. Not even a broken heart, just an empty feeling. And now when I meet someone who treats me well, I blow it! I'm so stupid.
I’m not a country fan but damn!!!
So true
Theme song for my divorce❤️

Was t a fan of wallen so I listened to this song and then all of his other songs made sense and sounded different in a iconic way
Same lost
I also heard this song being a country music lover for the first time today May 25, 2022. I have never known of him before and I absolutely love his voice and tone of music.  I had no judgment before hearing his gorgeous song. Apon searching the original song I found the interview with Michael Strahan. I honestly think it was very ignorant of him to make such a remark but we all as humans make mistakes and deserve a chance to make our wrongs right.  He did his due diligence...in my opinion.  I still love and will listen to his song and will continue following him as a singer. BTW I am half Black half white.   I suppose this is to the point where let bygones be bygones because we will never see the same way because honestly you are white and I am not fully white so you will never see my side of the spectrum.
I wish you well my friend ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Keep up the chin my guy!!  I know it sucks.  As an active alcoholic!!!  Bro I CAINT stop  but I hop that you can👍😊
hes good cant take it from him i play guitar  in sing to you either got it or you dont hes got it !
Kane Brown is irrelevant in country music.  He sounds rubbish.  He can't even sing!   I thought it was another bad, atrocious performance at the CAM fest on August 2.
HAHAHHA my name is morgan but a girl!!!  GREAT  singer I  dont know why but every time i hear this song  i start singing this song in my room  and pretend that its a concort LOL  i swear this is my faviorite song!!!
Kane Brown is a joke!  . How does Kane Brown manage to stay in music business?   He should get fired, cuz because he can't even carry a tune.  His performances at the CMA always sucked.  He can't sing or rap!  What kind of a singer is he?   There's no future for singers like Kane Brown or Khalid.  Kane Brown can't carry anything on his own, he has to be part of a collaboration...I'm actually surprised anyone wants to work with him at all!  If truth be told, I'd bet Chris Young and Blackbear both were forced to do so.  No Kane Brown at CMA awards please.  He's nothing but a loser who is terribly overrated.   Luke is a great country singer, but there's no future for singers like Kane Brown and Khalid.  They both are a disgrace to real country singers like Chris Stapleton, Blake Shelton, Luke Combs, Keith Urban, Walker Hayes, Dan&Shay, Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan

Im sober again since July4th 2022, i had 3 years before and 2 yr 10 months before and i just threw it away. Had to restart everything. Heroin was my best girlfriend I thought and this song describes my relationship with her verbatim.... prayers yall.

This my favorite country song now
Right down to this flame of this match
Good job my favorite song
If just one person read this, it will honestly make my day. I am a guitarist, songwriter and I know people write this all the time but I believe I’ll be the one you’ll be happy to listened to. I do all my songs and my videos by myself and I make a new music video every week with my guitar. If one person could give this a thumbs up, you’ll be one step closer to helping a musician’s dreams come true. You won’t be disappointed. Just give one chance and 3 minutes of your time. Thank you 🙏 🇨🇦🎶🎶💫🌍🎸
Maaan this song GOES HARD🦾💪🏿
This is a beautiful song!! Love is expensive weather it works or not!
I have always heard the song but bad not seen the video, LOVE.
Yasss pop it off Morgan I love you Morgan 😍😘😘😊
The song I wish that never would end
My new dude this guy is amazing
This song is for someone I wasted time on and it fits perfectly
Gosh dude..I love love your music!

Im trying hard to quit drinking but i work in a gas station and its hard when im surrounded by alcohol and im trying to get my girl and daughter back thats my motivation
shia le'budlight
4:21pm Louisville KY Waiting for a Lyft Thinking of my ex.. Next 20 seconds this song I NEVER heard in my life comes on...  Thank you GOD for seeing me out of that 5 year destructive relationship.
The song that is about to make me become hooked on country 💪🏾
Fuck, this song is so good. Morgan Wallen is beyond his years. One of the most underrated and greatest country songs of all time.
🔥🔥🔥 Loved it at first note
I sure hope I get to see him in concert sometime soon.  I discovered this song a couple of months ago and fell in love!  I  am a hairstylist and get requests for his haircuts, but I honestly didn’t know who he was until this song.  He has a phenomenal voice as well. Going to listen to all of them. 😊
I'm not the only one hearing the POV of him choosing alcohol and spending his relationship wasted right?
I know this is about a break up. But for me it's about cocaine. Stole my best years from me.
They caught him saying a racial slur on video.  Radio took him off the air.  Nashville tried to blackball him.  Then he cut this track, told Nashville to kiss his ass.  The rest will be history.  This boy ain't going no where's anytime soon.  This song is worth a Grammy in it's self !!!
On repeat everyday 💯👌🏿

Real country just hits different
Nice ..well done Morgan   I love your voice and those lyrics are amazing
Jesus Christ Saves  Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.  Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.  EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:  1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.  2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.  Biblical References: 1. Romans 5:9 2. Romans 3:23 3. Romans 6:23 4. Romans 10:9 5. Romans 10:13 6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9 7. John 3:16  God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time.
Love this

This is better than the remix.
I was really a sober but I recovered the moment I listened to the song
I’m dealing with alcohol issues right now. This song makes just sense. But I’m scared of dying because of my high blood pressure, etc. Addiction is a nightmare. I’m so sick of getting the shakes and feeling like I’m gonna die. Things will get better 😊
I love you
This 💔
All of these miles on this Chevy …
This song goes deep 😢😭💔
truth 1000%,   wasted time.....
4 baby boys given to me by my women and now 5 years laterer she has cancer. This song is against then cancer and the drama and times it is trying to take away from us and our babies.

Loving the stache. Finally a gritty soulful voice and twang in the guitar.
I just heard this song today on the radio and I love it. I can’t believe it came out over a year ago. I’m getting into country music 🎼
Going thru my 3rd divorce this song rings true
Make mullets great again !
You should do a ft with durk on this song!!
Perfect mix of vocals and music
You know an artist is special when you feel what they sing as much as you hear it. Its hard to explain, it’s just an emotional resonance. This guys got it.
Ive been playing this one song for over an hour crying my eyes out
Him and Luke Combs are my top two right now... and that's no particular order haha
This is so true
I keep listening to this song thinking about my friend John ⚫️😍⚫️
speechless all I can say is THANK YOU!
😎😎  Lauren Alaina is way way too~u^gly~to be part of any collaboration.  That's why she can't find anyone to sing with.  Nobody wants to be seen with her or sing with her in public, because she sings like a loser and looks like a fool.  She has a pathetic low life.  Kane Brown is the only one whom she can depend on, but his music career is falling apart too because of his pathetic lousy performances at CMA awards.   He's not gonna last very long in music business either.   "Kane Brown and Khalid can't sing is an understatement".  They both sound like street singers begging for spare change in the street.  I feel sorry for them
This farm ttis
God this song hit me so hard in the heart. Its been three years since my girl discarded me, and I’m trying not to cry my eyes out while I’m listening to this. Such a powerful song.
Reminds me of my job.  Waking up every day doing something I hate and wasting that time away.
I love this song  I listen to it every day and every night
You can't touch music but music can touch you❤
I’ve messed up for a 2 weeks. So lost! I promised this time would be different, that I’d give myself fully….love with my whole heart and not hold back. Thought she wanted the same, it felt like she did. But in a blink of an eye she changed her mind. Told me it felt like a fantasy. Not to call, text or come over. I feel like it was all my fault. But I don’t know what to think. I’ve been drunk, sleeping for an hour here or there and not eating. I heart feeling like a black hole.
bought my granddaughter concert tickets for her 16th bday.....we'll be seeing him on the 12th....can't wait
Sucks when it's hard to stop
Catchy, excellent composition and arrangement. Simply iconic.
He is the number one top singer I love the  Guy
Geez did the microphone Kill you or something
I am so grateful I have my husband  Great song
No word can explain how relatable this is to alot of people
If you don't know me my name is Layla
Beautiful ❤️🤍💙
I get chills every time I hear this song
Damn,right on spot again 🎶❤🍺...Thank you so much for sharing your Songs,&your Heart with all of us out here! Prayers for Everyone! Keep 'em coming #Morgan 🙏✌💚😊
I'm a recovering alcoholic but I never could get wasted on you
Racist garbage is still singing? Ick
It’s been two years since me and my ex wife and I don’t listen to county much at all. But this one hit the soul. All of time and energy wasted. Put me my feels so quick. This is country I can get behind. Not the pop country.
❤️❤️💯
The guitar guy is hot
I dedicate this song to my narrsastic ex husband!!!
I spent 5 years with her and we had a child and not even 2 years after having a child I found out she was cheating which crushed me but this song has helped a lot thank you 🙏 🙏🙏❤️❤️
People suck
Pure brilliance
Divorce sucks 💔
Hell I poured myself a strong one!
I'm growing watermelon 🍉
Hmm 🤔 where was this song when I was with my ex for 25 plus years Wow 😳  I'm happily married to my Jr high school sweetie now and these words will help. God bless you
I’m black and I love country music, there I said it.
This is my favorite song
Love this song, and the message.
This song makes me want to drive to Florida and see my family and listen to it about 35 times in all the fm radio stations on the way down overnight plus talking to them hard working truckers on the cb seeing all the amber lights we shine together … just like Jason Aldean In 2011!!
This dude is the truth man and the future of country music god bless ya Morgan keep doing ya thang bro
My manager told me to listen to this song. I needed to hear it. I struggled with letting go. I cared about this girl and she didn't feel the same. Instead she led me on and then told me I was a problem she used my kindness against me. Now I have to pick up the pieces but thanks to my new friends I sure won't be doing it alone. This song hit me like a truck.
Best raw vocals in the business. It's not even close.
Kevin Durant is a quitter
OMG!   This is my ‘beat myself up’ anthem!    I am currently wasting all of my time and all of my money and still saying the sorries I don’t owe you honey🎵🎵🎵.  It is so enlightening that I’m not the only one going thru a sucky relationship!
Will be played endlessly in every dive bar in America for the next 30 plus years … a fucking masterpiece!!!
He’s so average. Every genre is hurting for someone these artist so average these days and I’m not old
Beautiful melody!
FACTS
This song should be put on Spotify
I love this song it’s the best song ever made
This man is an amazing addition to country music!
I love this song so much I wish it was so much longer even
I literally listen to this song hundreds of times....over and over and.............
I am absolutely in love with Morgan wallen and his music he is amazing it'd be awesome to meet him
This song identifies exactly what a lot of people go through reading with our heart and not our brain and wasting a lot of time and money on somebody that doesn't appreciate it this song is so true and it's home
Heartbreak hurts whoever you are in this life. I went from homesick by Cane Brown because that's how I felt to your song wasted on you. It's sad mostly the time that was seriously wasted from my life and that means something more than any kind of money. It's that heartbreak and knowing you learned the hard way again. But we all need songs like this to let you know as much as it hurts it just not going to work ever and the time thing. Dammit I'm not leaving this life sad and sorry. I'm getting what I want and it's not going to be wasted it's going to be happy. Thanks for this song it made me really think. And I love your voice but I'm ending my songs with I just haven't met you yet. Life has good and bad and I love music it's a great way to get things out even if it makes you cry. Great song I'd love to see you in person.
i Love this song! Hes such a great singer and I find his songs soothing. I love him,
Wasted on you
Great song 👌 thanks u
One of the greatest country songs of all time, people just don't know it yet
The first comment about alcohol really got to me, thanks for the words Kevin, I'm next in line to defeat alcoholism.
I’m not a recovering a holographic lol. I’m just a badass that was wasting my time on another badass which happened to be a woman. So I’m here hope that gets to the top other than hey I hope your healthy and hey I’m an idiot post that always find there way to the top.
I love how the beginning riff has that 'blame it all on my roots' vibe!! MW is the shiz!!!
Such a beautiful song
Hang in there, Kevin.
Morgan I'm a HUGE FAN  I wish I could meet you in person
I don't know how many times I've played this song!
Looks like Kane Brown's music career is finally coming to an end.  He can't sing. How in the world this guy became a singer?   Even my 3 year son can sing better than him.  Kane Brown is a disgrace to American music industry.
Not going through a break up  but this song is beautiful!!
Morgan you the best you have helped so many people from depression thank you for being you keep up the good work
Not just thinking.  “Justankin”
I feel like besides the obvious meaning,this song is also about becoming someone you dont want to be. Whether you change completely, or go back to being the person you tried to forget.
💔😞
I love all your songs . You are my favorite singer
Maybe his best song yet.
Shiiit... Made me wanna have another shot
Wasted on nothing not drinking man it gets easier.It took my ass about killing myself to not drink.It was a daily occurrence for myself.Just work the steps you won't make by yourself if not.I personally didn't have done my share of meetings lead them etc. grim reaper sobers really fast.Lucky I was id have not helped raiised my girls,seen them to Kindergarten and Graduate.Perhaps see my 1st grandson do the same!! you'll find very few friends as their plentiful when your drinking/partying.Not ones worth having unless they have your back and encourage whats best for you ultimately.Long run picture brother keep that in your windshield everytime you want to drink stop somewhere and think about you and the time under your belt already.And the consequences and person you are when drinking!!stay the course brother.
No practice for Morgan just straight talent.
Truth
155 days sober today
I'm still searching for the strength I know I have within to put down the booze. Your music definitely helps brother. Keep doing what you do.
His voice is flawless💗🎧😍
He had me on miles on this Chevy
We love you Morgan💜❤️💜
This song definitely hits it right on the nail. Wasted on you!!!!
Excellent harmony and the guitar....well can't get a better blues sound. Nice!!!
Morgan you may not see this but my friends just met you at Orange Beach Alabama I wish I was there but I was in my condo 😭 they got a pic with you but I couldn’t be there 😭😭😭😭
Beautiful
Up until now I thought that this was Tyler Hubbard. That aside this song has definitely hit as one of my favourite current songs. Kudos. 💖💖
Been with my girl for 6 and a half years.... We had a beautiful baby girl. She takes me for granted... The relationship is toxic and it's been that way from the start. I lost my father 4 months ago and I'm 26. I'm realizing there's more important things in this life rather than fighting and arguing. I feel like I'm wasting the potential I have away for a person I feel has fallen out of love with me. I need to care more about myself not just for me, but our daughter too. I don't deserve to be in an abusive relationship. That's not what life is about.
Mthr fckrs got a mullet, a fckn mullet! Haha that'a boy, you be you and you're unbreakable
Back on repeat. Gotta love, love
I stopped listening to country music for over 5 years but this song just got me into country  again.
Song on repeat!!!!!! This hits so hard
Been there!  4 yrs later still hurts…..but never looking back!!!!
Sellout. Own the words you say and never apologize
Seen him live in Billings MT back in May.  When he started singing this, betcha a** I bawled my eyes out. ❣️❣️❣️
I’m not a big country music fan but this hits home BIG TIME!!
This song speaks to your soul
You are so good you could sing the phone book or the encyclopedia britanica  and I would listen your freaking awesome I love your voice and your songs.
MASTERPEICE
Song's great for doing some cocoa puffs 💀
💕this will be different but my heart wouldn't listen
I love this song
You are my favorite kind of singer if I ever meet you You would probably be my 1st wish on a 3 wish genie I love your songs I I love your mother so much oh you're old muller Through my own You really inspired me to start singing and I
This song really makes me totally feel this 100!! I never thought broken heart could hurt like this.
LOOK AT EVERY VERSION OF THIS SONG ON YOUTUBE / LYRICS, NO LYRICS, OFFICIAL, NOT OFFICIAL, HOW MANY FREKIN MILLIONS / AND SO WELL DESERVED / IT'S ALL THAT!
HOLY SMOKE
Never get tired of hearing this 🎵 song...
It's got that Garth Brooks friends in low places twang .
Y’all don’t forget to give credit to Ernest for writing this.
I am a black person love country music this song is a healer beautiful job
I love your music 🤟
Un
❤
I thought I didn’t like country music 😳🔥
Love this song it speaks the truth good song can relate love this song thank you
This purely coming from someone that doesn’t listen to country primarily…  But, Morgan is a BIG 🐐
He’s so talented
God love this song it's great
Why am I just hearing this song? And no I'm not taking it off repeat today or tomorrow😅😅
Did u ever get any herpes and other STDs from kissing every girl in the bar ?
What a voice 😍😍😍
I'm setting outside America's best hotel and for what.... I'm wasting on you
My uncle died so it really helps me morgan
Thank God we have music, it's songs like this that help us thru life as our way to combine language with our souls vibration and communicate the glory of life's trials and tribulations. What a beautiful yet sad songs for so many of us that struggle to express ourselfs and turn to those things "wasted on you". But this song is an inspiration to let go. Thanks Morgan and co., Great tune!
Omg I love this song
Oh I love this song
Want to dedicate this to the one I was madly in love with yet left anyway without so much as a spoken word since. Broken hearts are an understatement when you're going through this bs. For me this song has helped me pull through when there were days I didn't even want to leave the house. For any of you guys going through this currently I feel your pain, My advice is to pray hard and have faith,  It may not seem like it right now but it'll get easier.
I just left an “almost” abusive relationship but recognized the red flags than this song literally would play every time I jumped I’m my Jeep to storm off and cool down… it reminded me it is a waste of time and heart ache to try to help anyone who does not want to help themselves. Myself I take this song to heart. Thanks Morgan… it puts so many vices in perspective for me.
Howdy this is one my favorites thanks for making this song
I love  the song....1st time hearing it..✊🏿
we are your biggest fans
we are lissing to your songs right now and we are kids we love you
I'm tightening up. I don't drink too much ...I drink just enough 😄
❤️❤️❤️
Hands down best voice today
💖...HERMOSAÁAAA🙌👉😁👈🔥🔥🔥
I thought I met "the one " she broke up with me for reasons that seem to be excuses not real reasons.....she said she loved me first and somehow things changed...for her. For me I feel the same as the day I met her , and this song captures how our breakup went for me. I am heartbroken but this helps a tiny bit. Thank you sir.
The darkest ⚰️ song of' em all.
This song hits home. Looking back I was more than you ever deserved.
Although I’m not a big country music fan, I’m definitely feeling this song. Consider checking out my guitar cover of it https://youtu.be/ToUc_xm48Eo
My uncle's friend went to school with him his name is Cody
Mullet king

Damn son this one's killer. I love the shit out of it. My girl says you listen to rap why you listen to country I said I am country my lady don't give a fuck.
This song has touched my heart in so so many ways ❤️ my boyfriend passed two years ago June 26 six days after his 60th birthday we were together 13 years when he found out he was dying of cancer 3mths before he was constantly “breaking up” within two weeks he’d be back begging I held his hand and told him I forgave him for all he’d done but he had to forgive himself to go to heaven I had always known he’d cheated many times but he of course denied but 4mths after he died I got confirmation he had cheated this song hits those feelings and emotions 💯❤️
This song is making me feel things 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just heard this song!! It pounds!!!!!! Cool...
This is my favorite song I love it who ever dose not like it I don’t like you
I am loving his song and I am listening to the song right now
Love this song it cant ever get loud enough
Looks like I'm learning tha hard way again 🤞

Quit drinking at 24..... 38 started back up.. women...
THE EX FIANCE BROKE IT OFF AFTER 6 YEARS ....
This song rings a bell in my head!
Incredible vocals , harmony and instruments.. they  just flow , naturally. Rare
are you in my head
When this song comes on in the car, I put the windows down and blast it. I want the whole universe to hear it, and don't feel one damn bit of shame or embarrassment for it.
I need to let go of this alcohol too sometimes I just need help to let it go im an addict and I know it now but still don't stop
Southern USA baby. Love or hate it! This kid is laying it down with his beautiful vocals. I wish I could manage him. His ideology is right on target. Don't change a thing.
I’m so addicted to your music! It’s my drug!  God definitely gave you talent!  I can’t get enough of this song!!! 💗
Be happy n drink safely.  No need to be in your feelings.  Life goes on.
I have an alcoholic husband and he was clean for a little over a year and started drinking again. It’s hard but this song really relates to me. Thank you.
Sacrificed my life for you and your "family" wasted...you could have chose right love.
exactly
Dude making people pay for lawn chairs? Give me a break dude. So full of yourself. I don’t even listen to your crappy genre but grow up loser you suck.
I love this song it is a good way to spend your time thing
Recall Step#4 when wavering..searching fearless moral inventory...Great. Song
A constant reminder of what you've lost and gotta accept it... but what dosent kill you only makes stronger. God is the way!!!❤thank you Morgan...
I love your music  So much
Can’t explain how much this song has meant to me❤️ I hope you keep inspiring people for years to come!!
13 years and two kids. That's all
My Favorite country artist.
This song was just brought to my attention last week.  My husband ended a 7 year relationship with Me at the end of April,   adter he proposed in December  WITH HIS KIDS,  He asked me to move out 4  days after I had all my wisdom teeth removed, end of April. I had to load up an entire house and u haul by myself.   He relapsed on alcohol and drugs.   Kicked me out after I paid 22 grand to get his kids back for him, paid for every vacation, I put all the food on the table, I kept the house clean, full time school teacher. He took me for a fucking ride for 7 years.  It dam near killed me snd took all my family and friends to pull me back up.   It's July now,  I m much better.  Still go up and down.  He s getting back together with his x wife now.   I ll be ok. But dam this song pretty much wrapped it up and put a bow on top for me to give to him! Thank you Morgan !!!!!!!!!
I’m wasted my time to my Husbnd who chooked me every single time coz he don’t want me to have fun he want me in the cage every time with no freedom really sad 😢
Watching him play his album dangoures tonight in NY pumped
Never gets old. ❤️
Hey man, The definition is insanity is..    YEA I KNOW 🤷🏻‍♂️😞💔
Been going thru a break up for awhile now, still mentally not okay & this song is the best 💯🥰💕🥰💕🥰💕
❤😢 this song gets to me so much my fiance of 3 years died July 2nd 2021 and everytime I hear this the memory of him and his beautiful blue eyes looking at me singing this puts chills to my soul I miss him so much. And if I could have one more day with him. we had a crazy childhood and past together he was my bestfriend and I miss him so much. I didn't waste any time on him I feel my time now is wasted without him.
I love this song along with all of his other stuff.
Hi
This is another good song it really is home. I love it

Kane Brown should get fired. Kane Brown can't carry anything on his own, he has to be part of a collaboration...I'm actually surprised anyone wants to work with him at all!  If truth be told, I'd bet Chris Young and Blackbear both were forced to do so.  No Kane Brown at CMA awards please.  He's nothing but a loser who is terribly overrated.   Morgan is a great country singer, but there's no future for singers like Kane Brown and Khalid.  They both are a disgrace to real country singers like Chris Stapleton, Blake Shelton, Luke Combs, Keith Urban, Walker Hayes, Dan&Shay, Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan.
great use of chromatics and harmonies , awesome tune
"All of these sorrys I don't owe you honey" That line hits hardest for me.  Always apologizing when it was them at fault.  No more!
💔💔💔 Who's Lauren Alaina?  A good question. This is a fact.  About 12 years ago, there was a boy who who committed suicide because this girl made fun of him being gay.  She bullied him, harassed him, and pushed him around everyday and called him all kinds of name in the book.  As a result, he took his own life.  Alaina will always be remembered as a loser and online troll.  Kim English is Lauren Alaina's mother.   She keeps coming back here, because she has some explaining to do why her daughter (Lauren Alaina) bullied the boy?   Hello.  She's all over the place on youtube trying to get her daughter into music industry.  It's not gonna happen.   Watch, she's gonna bark at me like a dog....funny woman....lol
I love him and the other musician's harmony in this song and the dualing guitars!! Such talent right here...omg. 💙🥺

I let all this some kind pain get me alcoholi a bad drug to have but help all the bullshit go back to normal and really believe I wasn't time and money
Jesus Christ Saves  Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.  Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.  EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:  1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.  2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.  Biblical References: 1. Romans 5:9 2. Romans 3:23 3. Romans 6:23 4. Romans 10:9 5. Romans 10:13 6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9 7. John 3:16  God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time.
Should of made this the album version. The trap drums on the official release killed it for me.
Listen one time You may enjoy it! https://youtu.be/tR_AlZ-X7VQ
15th time I've listened in the past 2 hours. I love this song
Makes me proud his name Is the same as mine.lol
Definitely my favorite country singer right now. Keeping it country. I like it.
Literally been drinking to this for days

I haven’t drank since 2015 I’m bout to though probably will never quite
I love all of Morgen wallens songs I listen to them all day
Wow,  Thank you 😊,  ###1...
Beautiful,  exactly ❤️
Top of the line...awesome,  Powerful and true feelings. 👍 Thank you 😊
You are the American dream come true 🙏🏻🍀😇
The funny thing is you will never truly know if something in your life will really break you as a person until that something happens.  When it does you search for any little relief no matter how bitter the sweetness, just to feel normal again. I find a little normal with this.
Love you Morgan  Erica Badgerow Davis
It's 2022 But this song is still 🔥 👌 💯.....
Wasted so many unwanted years..don't no why ...
ilovethesongthewayitalk
I wonder if other people enjoy my music
How I feel about my wife🥴
this is song is ASS
Music are what feelings sound like. You rock Morgan!!
This song ought to be the song of the decade I left my wife of 8 years cause we never got along an I'm loving it
How many women have waisted their time on you mf
Cheating bastard
Truth
Not usually my cup of tea.... But this song is fire my guy
I’ve wasted 5 yrs for some one to just walk out the door and never look back.
Love this song!!
God this is a beautiful song. Really hits you in the feels when you're at your lowest.
Shit. Finally found it. Heard it while driving home across Alberta. I laughed out loud when I heard "All of this time, and all of this money". Thoughts of Pauline came to me. Glad you're gone girl. Seriously. Some of the time was good. I never minded spending the money, but I never owed you any of those sorrys you demanded. That was just a crazy game. Hope you're good. Don't call me.

This song makes me calm 😌
10/13 Duet female harmony wasted on you. I changed my whole life for you to give up on me. You got my hi then took off running. All of the truth changed to lies because you changed up on me. Forgiveness for why jesus christ hear my calling. I pray for a guide to get through the lonley. Everywhere we went i need a way from it.
Morgan is a god to me rt now this song is for me right at this moment in my life , hard times never stop coming .....my heart's about dead never will trust nobody ever again to waste my time on too painful I'll be alone forever
Bro you have no Idea on so many levels how helped me
This is what country music has always been striving for.  God damn Morgan wallen you are good.
Yup
All these sorry's wasted.love it.
it got me through a hard bender, wasted on the hard way to learn about life.
Looks like a bot lol
I spent so many years drunk everyday every weekend. I can't begin to tell you how truly embarrassed I am at the things I've done people I fought with for the love of alcohol .I unfortunately followed in my mother's footsteps for so many years. Years I can't get back . FRIENDS I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO GET BACK,so many times I don't remember. After emergency open ❤️ SURGERY in 2009 DUE TO A HEREDITARY ❤️ CONDITION I WASN'T Aware of I can't drink anymore than 2 MAYBE 3 BEERS a day if that.The  HARD SHIT IS REALLY HARD TO GET DOWN SO WHY BOTHER WITH IT ANYMORE  I don't know what happened to me as I laid on that operating table but I TRULY BELIEVE that God Had his hand in it to stop me from drinking myself to death. It's nice to be able to drink socially instead of full throttle DRINKING TO GET DRUNK everyday and stopping ONLY WHEN I was stumbling,slerring my speech. OR BLACKING OUT and that was almost 14 yrs ago .I apologized to  Family & Friends  I'VE HURT I'VE APOLOGIZED for what I did & how I  hurt them‼️ It was the only way I knew how to make things right  ❗ To get right not just MY FRIENDS & FAMILY ,BUT WITH MY LORD & SAVIOR  I don't know what he did but I'm glad he did it ‼️ YES THE LORD DOES WORK IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS AND IM THANKFUL EVERYDAY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THEM I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON .AND THAT I'VE DEFINITELY CHANGED FOR THE BETTER FOR LIFE ‼️‼️‼️
My wife fucking around, fuck the time spent waisted on you.
I pray if she comes back I could have another chance...
Sorry that was a duet the guy playing also has some great chops. Woo!
It is so impressive that he sounds EXACTLY like he does on the radio. So many artists sound so different than they do on their tracks. This is why I love him.
I actually didn't care for this when I first heard it, but now I am completely addicted to it. That, my friends is what is the ingredients for a timeless song is.
Slaves aren't sycophants.
My ex: looks like I'm better off without you. You look awful.  Me and alcohol: yeah we know.
Certainly can relate this song
Love love this song.
Love this song
Play this song on repeat and sing at the top of my lungs driving ❤️❤️
Helped me through a Break up as well, Made me realize I spent WAY too much time and money on her and she wasn't  worth my time
Just going through some of the comments and my heart feels for you guys... We've all been here and it hurts and it's confusing. Music is a beautiful thing, let it help you navigate through life more easily. God Bless all of us and thank you Morgan for your God given talent to reach people through music. Jesus is King of Kings
This song got me through the hard times without turning too the bottle
😎😎😎  Lauren Alaina is way way too~u^gly~to be part of any collaboration.  That's why she can't find anyone to sing with.  Nobody wants to be seen with her or sing with her in public, because she sings like a loser and looks like a fool.  She has a pathetic low life.  Kane Brown is the only one whom she can depend on, but his music career is falling apart too because of his pathetic lousy performances at CMA awards.   He's not gonna last very long in music business either.   "Kane Brown and Khalid can't sing is an understatement".  They both sound like street singers begging for spare change in the street.  I feel sorry for them
WHO'S HERE CAUSE LIL DURK??
just yesterday we were cuddling in the trunk of the pickup while watching a drive in movie and the next day she just decided that she doesn’t want me anymore. I thought she was the one and she just left me like I was nothing. thank you Morgan for getting me through a nightmare.
Great song dude absolutely awesome
My new favorite song ofc.
I like this song but l love it says waeted on you😊😇
My God currently going through a breakup & he doesn’t want us to ever get back together & it kills me cuz I’ve never felt what I have for him for anyone else & I just cry my eyes out I just can’t handle this…

The story of my life....
This is literally the song of my entire situation.
Kevin Durant, great going, what ever keeps you sober! Stay strong man!
This song is entirely too short !  Could listen to this all day, every day !!!
;((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
It has been a year after my breakup with a 3 year relationship and he cheated on me all that time and I still hurt to this day bc I loved him and trusted him now I don't know what to do
Kane Brown can't carry anything on his own, he has to be part of a collaboration...I'm actually surprised anyone wants to work with him at all!  If truth be told, I'd bet Chris Young and Blackbear both were forced to do so.  No Kane Brown at CMA awards please.  He's nothing but a loser who is terribly overrated.   Luke is a great country singer, but there's no future for singers like Kane Brown and Khalid.  They both are a disgrace to real country singers like, Chris Stapleton, Blake Shelton, Luke Combs, Keith Urban, Walker Hayes, Dan&Shay, Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan.
It doesn't get any shittier than this. This sucks, how do u get a record deal, and be so shitty? Unbelievable
This song cuts deep
Suprised how short this song is. Wish they made it longer
I waisted almost 9 years she cheated then left was nothing but a good husband and father to our kids now she has them call a punk daddy
love this song
Just heard this song today scrolling through my local radio stations, gotta say it hit a chord with me.
Love this song
I've been married for 14 years and my wife said that I give her too much love and so she wants to take a break.  I focus on my health and my kids now
13 years for what 😔
I'm sorry
Love it ❤❤❤
This song never gets old! This song fits right knowing I wasted 5 years in a relationship that was toxic. I had to better myself & continue on with life 🙏
Probably the best song I ever heard
sessions
This song brought me back to country 😊
I know it's strange but you got me through a hard loss!
The truth hurts...  Good riddance Princess.  Next time I give my heart away, I'm gonna make sure she thinks I'm worth it first.
from ARGENTINA , I realy love this melodys , its like a bullet in my heart making me feel the I born in the wrong country , I salute you MEN  in keep going .......cheeers !!!!!
Qué bonito tema.

Almost #1 on the Canadian Country Charts.. this song just kills..  Morgan Wallen just making those banging songs.. thank you Country music
Yall are the most anti American P O S  I've ever had the DISPLEASURE TO TRY TO COMMUNICATE WITH....THAT BEING SAID ... FUCK YOU,,,,,THE HORSES YOU RODE,,YOU DEGENERATES PROBABLY GOT OFF ON THAT TOO... I HOPE YOU HAVE ONE OUNCE OF PRIDE WHEN MY SAVIOR RETURNS
Can anyone listen to this song and think he is yelling at himself? He just has the witness the song was writen for??? I feel this way with my daughter.... not wasted days but me not taking full advantage on making her the best person possible? So I just found a different perspective on this song after hearing it for 200 times....
the very Best ever from him cause I'm separated for a couple of months now an I needed to hear something like this Thank u brother
Mmmmmmmkkkk well that was amazing
Had no idea who this young man was. Literally heard 30 seconds of this song and I was hooked! Amazing voice! Amazing talent! Just AMAZING!
Morgan wallen could sing no more monkeys jumping on the bed i would put it on repeat
always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Aw, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets to burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you  Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault, yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone, and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinkin' 'bout all  I've wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys' I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew, all them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you  Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen To my head in these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again That's why I've been  Wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew, all them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you  Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you  All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys' I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew, all them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you  Source: Musixmatch  Songwriters: Josh Thompson / Ryan Vojtesak / Morgan Wallen / Ernest Keith Smith  Wasted on You lyrics © Sony/atv Tree Publishing, Sony/atv Songs Llc, Round Hill Works, Big Loud Mountain Music Llc, Mv2 Music, Songs Of Universal Inc., Bo Wallace Publishing, Ern Dog Music, Red Bandana Publishing

Amazing voice morgan
This song is a Masterpiece
This is my 1 year old daughters favourite song.. haven't seen my little girl in months due to circumstances and this song will be with me forever ❤️
Morgan Wallen = gout  of country singers
I ment wallen
Morgan wallet your the best! I love all your songs but this one is special.
You'll probably never see this but I miss you and I'll always love you
Listening to this half hungover after texting her again..
Sounds like Jelly Rolls style.
Who has a obesion of MORGAN WALLEN
U R THE BEST
Good songs but when are they going to label them correctly? (Pop)
I hate him
This song reminds of my job Bridgestone 🤷🏼‍♂️😭
this song is amazing
These two are fucking brilliant together. Flawless performance. Morgan Wallen is a dangerously talented individual
Waisted 32 yrs looking .4 relationships gone down in flames..no more trying
"All of these miles on this chevy and prayers in a pew, All  them days I spent wasting on you." Realest lyric ever written.  Morgan is LEGIT !
Thinkin about all the time and passion my spirit invested, Let me take the time just 2 ask you one question, Did you truly ever love me or respect me, Why even waste your time just to leave me where you left me,
💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃🥃🥃💃💃🫦💃💃💃💃💃💃🫦💃💃💃💃💃🥃🥃💃💃💃💃♥️😘😘💋💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃🫦🥃🥃💃💃💃🎶🎶💃💃💃💃💃
I literally feel this in my soul! im dealing with this problem currently just dealing with a boy not a girl. 🤟🏽 stay strong always! 💜
This song got me.through a nasty divorce....but now I'm truly free
u ever loved someone so much that u hate them and then hate urself cuz u can not hate them for nothing in the world.and then the cycle continues over and over again damn I love u girl xoxo wfbbbjilye
All I hear on the bear
I love all his songs!
Pieces of shit that should have kept my name out of their mouth main brain 🧠😤has to go far away
My ex called off the engagement and this is the song that got  me through it love you wallen
I'm not a man. But this song hits hard. Reminds me of my ex and all the shit he did to me. The end of the relationship finally came when I found out he was cheating on me with his best friends girlfriend. So much time and effort wasted on him. I'm happily married now. But man. That relationship STILL haunts me.
As a metal head, this song hits..
LOVE THIS ❤️
🤩🤩🤩
Hi
I remember being in rehab and they wouldn't let me play this song I was so mad
I got forty seven hundred cousin.. and I matched Russian?
😆😆😆😆😂😂😂😂😂😂 I like your songs
This song makes so much sense and has brought me back to reality after a hurtful break up..
This is how I felt throughout all of my past relationships, I do so much for them and all they do is mistreat me I wasted my time and my life on them sad to say it but it’s true
How do think
I was around.. you heard nuts slap on leg
$20 a piglet.. Hope AR..told me
I mean it isn't bad
felt this song my heart is shattered 💔
This sounds A MILLION times better than the single version with that GODAWFUL synthetic hihat
Could listen to this song over and over again.

My favorite singer! He has a voice and now look what he has done...He is Back on top!!!!!!
Something tells me he will be the new face of country music
Wish this song was a minute longer!
A young bad ass Tracey Lawrence!!!
Some whiskey, a lawn chair, the bbq going, and this song. Can’t beat it.
Stuck on repeat...after I was told we need a break, idk if I'm coming back straight to the divorce! I wasn't perfect but gave everything I had even when I didn't want to nor could...wasted on you....💔
My son just texted me and said come check this guy out. His voice is ridiculous.
My friend just randomly messaged me on Snapchat and told me to listen to this😂
all of these "sorry's" I dontt owe u honey
Love  this song
He's a racist
Have Special lyrics for you little man it's ( Fuck IRS)?

This is better then the orginal
Probably one of the best songs I've heard by him cause I've been there with those lyrics and it hits home pretty hard.  Amazing voice
Here to see what the hype is about. So far not bad lol
I've said my sorries, and made amends. And I'm done.
Favorite song on repeat over and over ...
No more wasted time on you messed up folks and bimbos...
I can’t wach it… discusting
Not a Morgan Wallen fan...but I LOVE this song! Hits too close to home.
So much country on the radio that ain't worth a flip, then this.  Morgan Wallen is Nashville's Golden Boy.  This is Grammy worthy !!!
❤️❤️❤️
PERFECT HANDSOME!!!❤️
отличная музыка друзья

Something like that just deal with it nothing said ever matters to bad its so bad guess have to be whore no I'm good and am good co and well worth it
Hula of a talent
He looks like a toad but his music is great
His music speaks to me in the sense of looking back at my younger years.......amazing encapsulating how you feel when a break up happens.  You feel as if the time was wasted, bu its really not the case...its learning.
I think this song is about alcohol.
Yes! I've been I'll, but I'm getting better.. Lost my English mom and NC fdaf best parents ucking patriots who understood our Constitution and our history and I lost it. So glad CANCEL CULTURE IS OVER. MOVING TO TEXAS TO MOURN THOSE POOR KIDS AND MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY, MY HERO.  SO HAPPY YOU AND RYAN ADAMS ARE BACK. I LOVE TOWNES, GRAM AND ALL THE REST. And of course, Guy Clark.  I am crying.
This song hits deep
I listened to this song for so long after the guy of my dreams played me and dumped me and I found out he only dated me because he felt bad and just wanted to seem “cool”
The fog is coming
Who else is on the toilet taking a shit
i need you to come to illinois my guy.. my girlfriend loves you lol let me get them tickets! Come to Southern illinois!!!!

This song kicks ass! Hits on so many levels.
I'm always more interested in the guitar player/ back up singers for some reason.
The song doesn't always mean to your ex-lover he could also mean to other people in your life other a toxic people in your life. The song goes out to my mom she's very toxic. She has been very abusive to me and my sister are whole life. So this song is to my mom I know it's sad to hear but it's the truth. And also Morgan Wallen you're the bomb I love this song. Keep up with the awesome songs that have put out since up down up down. One of mine and my granddaughters favorites by the way is up down
My great grandfather just died and this song really helps me alot
Percussion could be a touch higher. But this acoustic session is so clear and well played
This song helps me get over her, even though we never dated. What could of been…
This song hits my soul so hard. My wife and I are going through the hardest time of our lives together. Ill do whatever I can for her. She is the love of my life.
Awesome song
“I don’t always wake up in the morning pour”
This song isn't long enough. 😭 Repeat!!

Keep up the good fight. God bless
Morgan has good music
As an addict. This song truly bring joy to my life. Please more of this brother. Thank you
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love to drink to this song!!!! Sorry!!!!
This is a reminder that I did better in my life on a love that can never replace what I had before because it’s even better then what I had and I am so grateful I got it. I thank god with all my heart I found it. The true meaning of love . And it’s simple not wasted at all…
Charging for 415 for lawn seats in STL when bigger artist than you charge 30 to 35 are you joking Dude what a douche bag hope it’s a ghost town bro
Hi! James rike how are you? I'm kate ana 😁
Reminds me a guy I wasted a lot of time on & even tho I still love him and will always love him it’s best he stays where he’s at 😏
My goodness. All I can think about when I hear morgan weller is how much I miss country music. Crap pop with a twang is still crap pop.
Morgan sounds like cool crush cigarettes and mdma come downs
I luvvvv this fkkkn song!!!!
I'm so glad he made it after the voice!!!! Country was definitely the right choice
Morgan Wallen/Sam Hunt. That song would be my favvvvvv.
This is my favorite song
i am this song
5 years sober  😊
Omy I'm speechless 🙊 😍
Man song hits deep like some blues feel the real pain to write something like that bravo hats off to the writer and Morgan
Go Morgan!!!!!!!!
I just love this song
Awesome song
Morgan Wallen killing it. Every 👏single👏time👏
Couldn't be a more truer song. Especially the money part....
Damn!!!!!!!!!
I’m currently was sent to listen to this song from my best friend who is trying to commit sucide as we speak. From a woman that basically use him and I have to be the one he tell this too. I wish I can take the pain from Him. Please check on your people 🥺
I was raped when I was 10 by a man with a developmental disability 4 times over the course of a summer. This song saved my life.
this is a great song I relate with  it being away for 15yrs doing wrong in my life before now I'm out and it hits the spot
This is my favorite song
I'm a libra wasted time on a narcissistic waste of space
Wasted on a narcissist
Never been a huge country fan. Few songs here and there.  But...this song is raw...and beyond words.  It's a punch in the heart. Had this played for me and now it's ran through my head for days. Can't stop listening to it. It's like a stranglehold on my insides.  Every person that was involved in making this song happen is a part of magic.
Who is the guitar player????
Amen brother hit me right at home morgan
I think everyone has at one point wasted time on someone. Too bad I didn't learn sooner.
A.. fucking MEN!
Love this song ❤️✨
This is a really good song I love it Morgan it makes me think of my old house like by dirt too I love your songsss if you see this i love this song
Left my abusive wife , while in recovery , and sick with health issues. I heard this song while I was in prayer about my future, and God used this song to reiterate that I made the correct decision to leave and stay gone! Thanks Morgan
Can’t stop listening to this for the last year or so. Girlfriend gets mad every time it plays and says some is this how you really feel shit 😂😂 not even about that. Just those lyrics. Your draw. The way you put your heart into what your doing! You got it bro!!!
Guard your heart fellas there's no such thing as unconditional love. Hypergamy is real. Remember the person that cares the least has the upper hand in a relationship. F U you Cayla cheating ass HO
"right down to the flame of this match" ... play+repeat
Somehow I’m late to the game with this song, but I love it! 🥰
Thanks Morgan. Charlotte I hope you're happy now. All of my love wasted on you.
Wasted all my time!!!!
It reminds me of why I left my abusive ex husband!!! 10 years ago
I Love this song, Morgan, Your Blue Flame Hot.
I Love U. Been there done it HARD. Wasted  basted & flipped buffalo style. Now I’m 51. Hard w none of the basics in life. I Love U.
I relate to this song💀 I stayed with my ex after we broke up wishing another chance to be together. We slept and I put my heart in it hoping he’ll come back but in the end we both ended up hating one another
❤
Too bad this guy's tickets cost more than any other country singer in history,.
Have special songs for you only 💟 your beautiful voice brings memories Tennessee mountains and Kentucky Hotty I'm not Government Man And IRS , kiss My lake Cumberland ass
Why don't you just call if you want to talk, I'll talk to you I'm still here   btw I love this song too
Awesome 👌
My dream nobody but victims listen somebody can always over ride no matter how big 50 states feel out of control criminals running country see it all not safe with families money impersonation murders ordered threatened no privacy idk big deal over this and home land ice helping idk but they have say
This is country music reborn. Anyone who don't like this is a fuckin' idiot !  This boy is amazing !
Confirm for my phone only
Catchy song, love it
Wow ... Is all I can say... I feel like we all can relate some how...
Don't we all know this pain ?  Incredible song

Such a modern classic sound & story. Cheers y'all

Excellent job, gentlemen. Phukking WOW Thanks for this one Respectfully
I love your singing
I’m sitting here drinking thinking about if i passed my state exam for college and I put so much into to pass and suspense is killing my right now and this song is calming me down somehow.
I drank with the best for years. Still not to be a sook. But the timeing is incredible. Cheers
Yall idiots missing the dam point it’s about a girl you clowns now sit back and sip a cold one 🍻😎
7 years and he walked out to get high 🥺 it’s all my fault for ever trusting the process of him staying clean. All I can do is pray he doesn’t die to heroin 😔
Damn this song hits
Yes have him repeat
Ilove this song beautiful amazing masterpiece keep it up
Why are they not playing this on the radio? They made it damn near techno.. such a great song
I think this song is of the charts best lately
Hey buddy you need to be with your baby boy and your ex you need that relationship with them overall you are responsible for him and potentially her  "your ex."
I also heard this song being a country music lover for the first time today May 25, 2022. I have never known of him before and I absolutely love his voice and tone of music.  I had no judgment before hearing his gorgeous song. Apon searching the original song I found the interview with Michael Strahan. I honestly think it was very ignorant of him to make such a remark but we all as humans make mistakes and deserve a chance to make our wrongs right.  He did his due diligence...in my opinion.  I still love and will listen to his song and follow him as a singer. BTW I am half Black half white.
Morgan ты лучший, так держать

Such a waste of time !
A old friend once told me I have been cold for as long as she could remember. I fell in love once an I have never loved anyone so I have been alone for half my life so they see me as cold i don't really show emotions but when I hurt my hurt is more then I can bear to stand for everyone has seen that when the one I have always loved came back to me an I still hurt an shes been gone  a year now an my hurt has just now got to where I can handle it without crying 🖕🤕 I've not cried since I was a little kid haha
Me and my daughters mom. Right here. I’m raising her alone now.
I’m a big addict to drinking fucking sucks wish I could get better
Love this song  I love the sound of his voice singing this  song. It has a raw sexy tone to it.

This man don't miss
Angel voice...
Man can't sing a fuckin lick. Garbage
It's catchy
I proud of everyone who has accomplished a goal for there life
This song is too short. It needs to last like, half an hour 😄 Wasted on youuuuuu 🎶
Friend greg YouTuber
Wasted on the wrong one thats for sure
I wish that they didn't ban him from radio stations because of a racial slur, I mean everybody makes mistakes
Yassss
Im not a fan of country music and i heard this song for the first time and now i think i missed out on some good music, bt never to late tho.
When I listened to the words .It's like here we go again! But today I have listened to my heart and I am sure that I never wasted nor will I be wasting it on you.
Crazy great man!  Really fantastic.
Hands down my favorite song right now!! When it comes to my life this song nailed it to alcoholism to family to friends to loved ones to all my ex-lovers I was never good enough for spent too much time wasted on you!! Yes it's a reminder of all this but it gives me strength I was still good enough for the person that created all them which is God so I'm thankful for that
Great songs, great singer, great music. You definitely sound like a talent show winner. But your music is blues or pop. Why are you trying for a country fan base? You are a C - class act at best for now. I would never pay hundreds of dollars to see you. And make you rich and famous. Something isn't right about you and I would not hang your hat up just yet. People don't forget your politics very easy. Who are you? Are you going to come out of your closet and announce  you are gay. So you will be the first gay male country star in history? That would make you famous on the news but it is short lived. Hmmmm are you a 3 hit wonder?  It all remains to be seen what direction you take on  down the road. Hmmm? Personally  I don't care about your orientation  or your private life. Not my business. But I'm watching and you haven't scratched the surface of paying your dues to country music. You are in the land of legends. Tread lightly  Mr. Blues pop singer. No way will I buy your fake country sound.
Thank you I listen to this when i sad and it makes me happy
My favorite
Every time I hear this dude, I think of Toby Keiths song, American ride. Got herself a record deal and can't even sing a note. Thats this somebitch. This absolutely sucks balls.
I get so lonely but Morgan always brings me out of it

Does this guy sing anything other than ballads?
He's great man ilove his voice so happy for him
Looks like I’m learning the hard way again 😢 hard to get the strength
My ex blames me for everything and I am over it. I definitely wasted my time and gave up my job just to be with him
He'll always be a racist in my mind... No matter if he was drunk or not...
Love this song ❤️❤️❤️❤️
14 year marriage 😭 I've needed this song for the last couple months....wasted on you
Completely true. This song is so true, never could appreciate anything I did for my family going away to work and missing my family grow up without me seeing them from a tiny box so they can have a good life.
Love it
Wasted 4 years of my young life...this is for you Scott..you got what you deserved. Been married 23 years!
Why does the beginning of this song sound like friends in low places by garth brooks
How is he real like how 🤠❤️❤️🥺
I absolutely love Morgan Wallen and this song. He is absolutely amazing. This is how country music should be. ❤️
If it means anything at all but I’m not to much of a country songs! But this right here is in my top 10 of all time!! Awesome work!
This is just so awesome, country music is back,love it
That guitar is just muahh
Got discarded by a narcissist woman... though I met the nearly perfect person, single mom to a beautiful little 2 year old,   ... just turned into a nightmare of a relationship where I wasn’t valued one bit.  At times I miss her, and not a day goes by I don’t miss that little girl because I was ready to be that father figure... this song just reminds me that we ain’t human punching bags for nobody.. I pray they’re good 🙏🏻.  And hope I find some one that loves me , and that I could love back...
😍💖💖🔥
I’ve been sober for 5 years! God bless and I mean that
I'm learning the hard way again.  I need to walk away from this man.  Before I waste the rest of my life.
😎😎😎.  Seriously, everybody has to know that, Lauren Alaina is way way too~u^gly~to be part of any collaboration.   That's why she can't find anyone to sing with.  Nobody wants to be seen with her or sing with her in public, because she sings like a loser and looks like a fool.  She has a pathetic low life.  Kane Brown is the only one whom she can depend on, but his music career is falling apart too because of his pathetic lousy performances at CMA awards.   He's not gonna last very long in music business either.   "Kane Brown and Khalid can't sing is an understatement".  They both sound like street singers begging for spare change in the street.  I feel sorry for them.
❤❤❤❤
Awesome song
He feels this way about me and it kills me
Absolutely obsessed with this song ❤️❤️❤️ Morgan can't make a bad song, he is amazing!!
I love this song I love Morgan wallen man
I Love this song so much it gave me goosebumps ❤In fact I love all kinds of music but this has got to be my favorite
Looks like im learnin the hard way again 💖🎼

A long long time ago, wasted on you. Thank you Morgan Wallen for not living in the past!!!!
excellent thx a lot
❤
Luv this song 💙💙💙💃
Seems to be the right song at the wrong times in my life
I knew it was you. If you can ever forgive you the I have to.  God I miss my perfect man
Love it
Me encanta sus canciones.
awesome song. Ok this is weird I can't stand country music
I am not big on today's country music but this is absolutely my favorite song..hope my neighbour's like it too lol
I love this song. It makes me have flashbacks to past relationships. I realize I contributed to the end too. I wish I could go back and tell them I’m sorry for the pain I caused them. Sometimes you feel too much pain to recognize the pain you are causing others as well. I don’t want to do that again. I’ve asked God to heal me so I don’t hurt another person. ❤️
This hits different when you wake up and realize a 6 year relationship I've wasted this much time to someone who know matter if 6 more years passed I can't make it better and refuse to try any longer❤️
This song is one of the best breakup country songs and just period you perfectly nailed this Morgan thank you ❤️
Sounds good, I like it 🤟
@Jen Baker
I hate how much I like this song. Lol
Lol I could say the same and see the likes.  SMH
I love your songs
Love's NEVER "wasted"- if so you didn't TRULY know or really ever have love.🎶💜
jkj. no 0 0. olp
Awesome 🎵 🎶 🎵 🎶 🎵  Thanks for such a great song
I fell like we live the same life! Morgan that dude
Hey Morgan, great tunes, hell, i like em enough, id even buy my xwife and new hubby tickets!😂
I love wasted on you
My favorite singer!!
I thought it would be different this time 😔 never trust what you think is love
Love this song!! And You proof!
Just can’t get enough of this song!
I didn’t leave them broadway girl alone 😅 No relationship ended and this joint passed randomly on the radio 📻,I’m like damn son I wasted my time on the a heifer 🤣 Time to start living, Best song 🎶 of the year 🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿
a few weeks ago my mom commented something about me and yeah i really love this song morgan really helps me feel good about the songs i write and play your vioce is so good morgan love ya
Damn, wow, and jeez… ??? Any other words?   So good…
I’ve tried resisting your music so much ……stop it.
I like it nice song
Makes me think of my father. An alcoholic who I never really knew. We started talking when I was 25, 1 year before he passed from Cirrhosis of the liver… I love you Dad…
Love this song ❤️❤️
Silly me. I thought Real Country was dead.
Damn good tune
I know I've known this man somewhere in life.If so or no I gotta say this man got me feeling his music. I say that respectfully.
As a man who went through a dark phase of depression after my kids mother called it off with our family 3 years ago I understand going to hell and back. Morgan’s first hit “whiskey glasses” was still popular in 2019 & it was my drinking song to cope with. 3 years later and I’ve only touched a mix drink once this year for a special occasion. At that I didn’t finish it there was no longer a need to which I thank God for. This song confirms that and thank you as well Morgan for bringing us hits during our toughest moments you may not know this but they help a lot of us get through our days. 🤜🤛
You speak to my soul, I just love you ❤️  #thank you
I've been married for almost 30 years to a man who doesn't drink, smoke, or gamble.  He has even raised my two oldest girls as his own when their father left the state to avoid child support. I was NOT looking for a father for them or to get married again  (its a long story,  but i found out that i wasn't even legally married the first time). I will never leave or get a divorce. I don't believe in divorce unless absolutely necessary. However,  I've loved him. I was never attracted to him.  It is what it is.
Good stuff
best song. beautifully sang.🤍
I really love this song it's like you plucked it right out of my head .
I listen to this song over and over on every platform I can. Going through a divorce from a narcissist who has stolen my whole sense of self and self worth. All of these sorrys I dont owe you honey, hits me every time
When I get bullied I think of this song then I fight back I will never unsubscribe from u Morgan wallen 🥰🥰
I just come across this song a few weeks ago and its been keeping me alive.I play it all the time. Its like me singing my story....thanks 😇
I just saw Maren Morris at Wal Mart. She was a cashier where she belongs.
love this song and video!!
When i was younger, they made fun of me, for being black, especially seeing that i grew up in Jamaica, and turned out to love country music. Morgan Wallen, thank you for keeping me in love with country. I listen to you daily and i fall deeper and deeper in the stories told and the memories shared. See you at the Xfinity Center!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
💕Morgan can sing!!! Love the song 🎵 congratulations on your continued success!
mogan you need to add this version to spotifiy its better so smooth keep it up
I felt that…All of these miles on this Chevy. How many times I’ve gotten in my truck and tried to drive my problems away.
I know you will probably never see this comment but I felt like I needed to say that this song alone has helped me more then you will ever know brother thank you!!!!
This song helped me through a very dark chapter of my life
You’re the best singer in the world
Damn good song!!!
Everybody acting like he didn’t say Chevy Impreza…..

Ok Morgan Wallen I think this song was written about you & your kids ex.......  Im just saying because I heard a bird today about you & ex
“All of these sorries I don’t owe you, honey” Truth.
Omgoodness, I luv this man and his songs...............
wow
This is apart of the my life sucks playlist glad this song is here though!
Love is powerful, when you have it you can do anything, when it's missing you have no motivation
This is my favorite song
This version is so much better than the original. The popping hip hop bass does not match as well and ruins this beautiful song.
The 2 of you harmonizing is incredible
Your voice 🥰
This is such a good song. If this a #1 it better be in the top 5!
Hell yeah
This is the version. Sound quality on guitars  and vocals is so much better.
This song helped me through losing my pup and ex all in 1 month my heart still hurts but it's music like this that heals
He’s on his way to b 1 of the best in d business
💔
Saw you in concert a couple days and it was everything I could have hoped for. I've been listening to your music for the last 3 years and it only gets better. I remember when Heartless first dropped and I blasted that on repeat for weeks---even louder whenever I was forced to be around the person it made me think of the most. Thank you Morgan. I can't wait to see you take off even further. You deserve it.
Brought back a 20 year old breakup
It’s not hard to see the Eagles influence on this track.
Sings from the heart, always has an always will
Drunk as fuck rn thinking bout how my ex sparked my darkest addition..... alcohol 🙃😕😥
I love me some whiskey and tequila, but I sat the bottle down not long ago. It’s amazing how easy and hard it is to avoid the drink. Like it becomes who you are yet not who you are. I’ve had one drink since I quit, I was with my brother at a pizzeria waiting on the order, I loved it and hated it all at the same time. One hell of a self control outta control setting.
This song is amazing you are the best country singer
I wrote my own verse to this song check it out!  https://youtu.be/or_r0cgDVQU
I dont always wake up in the morning, poor myself a strong one......that spoke to me
Love you dude, I've always been a fan keep on keeping on roll damn Tide!
very good song bet ive listened to it more than a hundred times by now
3 years I put up with BS and now I can relate to this song so much more, and I love this crank and sing.
Im not sure what i miss more her or the whiskey... 😪😪
I love his voice !!!!!!! This man can sing anything !
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ This man’s voice is like butter!!!!
best song ever
Chevy songs are the BEST ❤️🔥🔥🔥
Those face expressions though lol😂😂
I love this song
Would be so much better if I was singing as a duet with you.

All I listen to is country music 🎶 But, Morgan's music touches me deeply.💙 He sings with so much soul & emotion I'm super obsessed with his cute self🙂🎶✨💙

Amazing song... it hits home 4 sure...thnxs Morgan
I don’t listen to country but flipping through radio I heard this tune !!! Loved it the moment I heard it !
I listened to his entire CD While I was pregnant with my son I should of name him Morgan or Wallen ❤️❤️
I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Aw, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets to burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault, yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone, and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinkin' 'bout all I've wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys' I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew, all them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen To my head in these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again That's why I've been Wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew, all them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys' I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew, all them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on y you

Always have to play this song twice! The best of the best!❤️
Love this song ....and the way he looks singing this song...
I sing and write songs too, I usually just perfom at the local coffee house, and at this building my boyfriends parents own. It would honestly be a dream come true to be able to make a song with him. He is my all time favorite artist.
Sucks we could only "like" once  I've watched these videos 1,000 times!! 💕
😄well this song gets me hyped 😄❤️love it, have me indignant AF 🤣

I swear he can't make a bad song! He's just amazing 👏 I'm a big fan!
Why’s no one talking about his backup singer?
IT WASNT A PHASE MOMMA!!!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I told this girl I liked her ( she was the first girl I ever liked ) she flipped out and called me a stalker despite the fact she was the one staring at me in class and looking at my stories even after unfollowing me now she’s getting her boyfriend to follow me on Social Media because she blocked me
Yo if anybody get that pass it’s this man
Hi guys, what a fuck song, it's really good. I'm from Brazil, and I'm here for the first time that I really enjoyed this sound. I became a fan, congratulations for the work.
This song has single handedly kept me afloat through my depression for literally months. Thank you Morgan Wallen for performing this flawless record. It has helped me and I’m sure it has helped countless others. God bless.
This song

Time is the one thing that makes all of us even rich Or poor doesn’t matter.  Time is all we want more time
nghe mà ưng hết cả tai , đức phúc cover mãi đỉnh
Heard this song on a TicTok video and was inlove instantly. I'm a recovering drug addict..hitting 9mos clean on the 26th of this month. No rehab no detox..all on my own. This goes out to the drugs and all the fake friends it came with. Every day is getting easier and music has been a huuuge part of my recovery. Thank you Morgan! This song has been a blessing in my sobriety. I listen to both versions in the morning when I start my day..shit will NEVER get old ❤
Is this what countries come to smdh
I feel it
My daughter is a singer songwriter and she's stuck on this song she's been through a lot and I know it's gonna get better for her when she starts this new chapter in her life
wallen u need to countinue this song

Great song! Love you Morgan!💜

If Lionel Messi did country
This my favorite song with both a beautiful lady, and a drink!

Morgan Wallen..."YOU DA MAN" Brother!!...Hope To See You In Edmonton, Canada Soon, Cheers Brother!!!!

I give up you all got your picks of women singers so you all be happy with them
20 years of my life have been thrown out the window by the love of my life
So true..memories left now  .I won't say it was wasted but it was a lesson for sure. Can only wish him the best.  Hope he gets kicks his addiction.  Becomes the man he used to be.  The one I loved.  May always. A small part.  I am moving on though.
You are my favorite singer
I usually don't listen to country but I love this song
I love this song 🥰🥰🥰
Forever classic
this song has me thinking about an ex that i don't even have 😂
You can feel his songs
Talented but what an ass
You can tell they feel this song in their soul. I sure do
I hate that I love this song because I thought he was just another shitty country singer on the radio and people only hyped him up because he said the N word but dude is talented af
This is getting me through my breakup today
I SO WISH I HEARD THIS BACK IN 2019!!!💔💔💔💔💔💔  You can hear the heartache and see the emotion on him when he sings this song....🥺
right now im seriously thinking of leaving my current relationship... its funny how music is so strong it can help you make up your mind sometimes.... its gonna hurt but i think its time to stop wasting my time with something that wont ever change
Nếu thích bản cover này của Đức Phúc thì hãy chia sẻ thật nhiều ạ. Ekip sẽ có động lực tiếp tục ra mắt nhiều ca khúc tiếp theo nè ❤
Tell me how this song makes me feel so much better every time I’m upset and I’m in a healthy thriving marriage? 😆
love the song
I love this song
This guy doesn't have a bad song. love him ❤️
Without me it’s only 53 millions views
Morgan said nothing wrong then even more people bought his music!!!!!!
Great song could mean so many things 😊
might be young, but love doesnt care about how innocent you are, it will damage you. Now im a little older and the heart ache still sits beside me and bugs me when it wants to. Wasted innocents for a broken heart.
Him and luke combs are carrying country music
Cool 😎 thanks
I wonder what Morgan Wallen and Tyler Childers would sound like together!
I love ur music Morgan...but I'm pretty sure you did this  because you accidentally said the N word and had to make things straight.
Working through a divorce and this hits home. I've spent so much time and energy missing her and beating myself up as if my life is over. I have my babies we made to help me through. I'm also working to maintain my Sobriety and this song makes me feel the pain, yet feel free from them. Thats true country right there.
Morgan OMG just came out of relationship man took my time, money etc thank you for giving me the words in a song to explain how I feel!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Dude puts out some bangers, best love songs out there.
the only way ive ever learned anything is the hard-way
The goat 🔥
Damn...👏
I love this song morgan wallen is awesome!
All them days I wasted on her self-entitled narcissist self
Man this is exactly how I’m feeling right now. Girl left me after 7 years for my “bestfriend” 🤦‍♂️
this songs been getting me through my first brush with heartbreak. i got blindsided and had no idea to respond. “all of these sorrows i don’t owe you honey” damn that lines relatable. i didn’t do anything wrong, she just put an end to it. thanks morgan for helping me through this, i’m gonna be listening to this track for a while
Favorite singer
Fuck liquor lol got a bad hangover n now voting for Heroin to be legal instead of this shit
Damn this shit hits so hard.  Even if you dont like country this is damn good song. Wish this song was around back in day but like wear country is going cuz never was a huge fan on current country growing up.
I can't wait to drink
Me and my soon to be ex wife..... shattered my heart and she doesn't even care about single bit
💧💙💕💧💙💕🔥
Thank you Morgan. You see it might be someone grasping for a way to get over the biggest heart break they have ever known.   Or stop destroying the world they have right now with OH so many ways offered up these days  You guys think your just artists musicians singing another 5 star song.. No.  Take a look hope you see your song might be someone's saving grace .
That's good keep it up
Had a really bad relationship with a girl who  cared more for my money then she did me.  I know I should have walked way but I didn’t untill it was to late. I was wasted on her, and her false promises. This song got me through it. I still listen to it and look back and still shed tears when I think about her. Thanks for the GREAT song. It helped heal me.
Absolutely love this song. His voice is so beautiful!
Like me and hockey
Your my favorite I love you me and my boyfriend listen to you all the time!!!
unreal talent unreal story unreal person! every song is an instant smash

Morgan! You never Cease to amaze me. I filed for divorce after 27 years and the hell I went through this song sums it up. Thank you I sure needed this song. Helping me get over a narcissist relationship
🔥
All I can say is Holy Shit after hearing the first time on radio
It's so true love morgan wallen I need this
I love this man's voice. ❤️ Great song.
I love your music!! Love country!!
This hits so hard right in the core of my soul. So much time and effort wasted on women who didn't even deserve a blessing after a sneeze.... It sure helps to hear all those feelings put into a song. A tear is a thousand words if it's done right, a song is a thousand tears if it is sung right. This hits the nail square on the head.
He’s incredible
Crazy book voice
This is me and all the drugs I've been on. Tomorrow is day 6 longest I've ever been without anything. And thats cause of my family and the women of my life that always knew I could do it.
2021 my but but i feel like this came out yesterday
I can't stop listening
3 years,  2 babies and this is where I am...HEARTBROKEN!!!
O-wow I know what he it talk about I have done the samthings I have wasted a hole lot of money and time but it is my  Stupidity !!!
From the first note, this song sings great.  Perfect.
Shit does it ever stop

All them days I spent wasted on you.....ain't that about a bitch!
That guy on the guitar...😍
Morgan Walken has a beautiful voice. God bless him
I’ve lived this song

This guy is one hell of a songwriter
When I hear this song I think of the place I grew up , louisana
I adore you!
This guy had me at Whiskey Glasses... been a fan ever since
Heard the song on the radio and i don't like the radio version cause I love this version so much more! Sounds much better
I though this song was my new favorite song for the first minute and then the next 2 minutes were the same lyrics.
Great music
Killin” IT YOU GO LEGENDARY
I am obsessed with this song!!!
This song is getting me through breaking up my relationship with my mom.
i got divorced, after 34 years, 2 kids, i told her to quit work, raise kids, i provided all the income for the family, i was working 92 hours a week, max allowed by law, divorce, was mutual, she wanted town, i said im never leaving country, even help her move, really nice tune, love the guitar, since i play also, thx.
I'm a person who wears her heart on her sleeve and I wasted years on a guy and now I'm doing it again
His songs are helping me through so much mentally.  🙏🙏🙏🙏
Please tell country radio to start playing this version instead!!!!
people who don't listen to country music don't know what their missing. I feel bad for the people who don't have country music in their life.
Morgan wallen is becoming my favorite country artist. I absolutely love him!!
I'm old....45....my musical influences thank God are from the 50's onward ALL GENRES,... ALL ASPECTS OF MUSIC... And I have no biases...good music is good music...this man can sing and deliver a message! How fucking good is music 🎶????
🔥🔥😍
Losing myself to all of this. Stay strong
My wife decided to have an affair a little less than 3 months after our wedding. This song has saved my life a 100 times over. Listening to this felt a lot better than a bullet to the head. Love sucks...

So much better than the album/radio version. Love the rawness without the hip-hop sounds.
This song was with me through the darkest chapter of my entire life. Crazy how words can sometimes speak to you in just the right way even if they are sad.
You the Man Morgan!!!keep trucking homie!!! Keep making  good southern  country  from San  Antonio  Texas
Goin through some shit, this song pulls me through
I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Aw, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets to burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault, yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone, and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinkin' 'bout all I've wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys' I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew, all them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen To my head in these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again That's why I've been Wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew, all them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys' I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew, all them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you
I like your songs
My favorite song love u
This version is so much better than the album version.
Cooooool
Troietil
this is one of the best songs ever made
Love this song! Speaks to the ❤ heart.
Great song
This is talent. This man has it. Love your music Morgan
DAAAM what a great song
Man!!!!!
Probably the best song I ever heard!!!!! An I'm a music affiaionnodo.. sry I couldn't spell affiaionnodo
Man, I had no idea that Morgan Wallen dated my ex. I'm sorry brother, I'll send you my therapist's business card.
Okay, but can we talk about the guy playing guitar and singing? I'm not the only one who thinks he's cute, right?
The song heals my heart
I thought this was Jelly the first time I heard it. Good tune Morgan.
Jimmy is coming to California in the morning 🌄
Inside message to André Martins Fachada;  honey I just got the lyrics going three sheets to the wind, instead of staying with Jennie Kim. LOL
Very possibly the best country song and songwriting ever.. you are great.. I'm 70 been listening to country since I was 13.  Keep it up
This is the only version I like
Wasdate
Wanna see Dominic Fike cover this song 🔥
Finally being played on country radio!!!
This reminds me of my next stimulus check ✔
Stay strong Kevin not worth it you been so strong for so long 💚💪
Alcohol is for people that dont want to feel feelings. They hurt
Lil Durk brought me here 😂 🔥
22!
This song is something that brought tears to my eyes and I don't cry😐
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I love the old country sound. He's so good
The way he shakes his head with, "all those sorries I din't owe you honey".
he turned on me in the weekend again, and him and his family ganged up on me too. I feel like they are gas lighting me. I find myself here again listening to this song. He has treated me like a princess before all of this, and I thought he was the one. I am so scared to leave him. I just don't know what to do.
....starting all over again for the LAST TIME...no more time or mone wasted.....
And this is why I treat them like a dime a dozen. No regrets. Can't be hurt
You said it perfectly  this song is like a soundtrack to my life  keep doing what your doin brother saving the world a Lil at a time god bless you
It’s been over a year since my soul felt the slice.    Finally this song helps me let go of that pain
i listen to this song at least 4plus times everyday . ili
What kind of guitar was he playing on?
This song hits home fr love this song got me thinking of all the time I spent wasted on you
It be a good tune. Sounds sooo filtered by computers. Imagine it being recorded with Tape like the good ol days!
🎶🎶🎶💯💯💯💯💯♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️Absolutely  Love This Song!!! Truth!!! FACT!!!
I love this version of the song
Looking for ways groups
My name is Kate Albert sondrae
😪
I've been listening to this song on repeat for like a week now!!! Amazing. I love the double entendre. Such and amazing song.
God Bless you Morgan! Thank you! I'm brokenhearted right now. After 17 1/2 years in a relationship, Idk what's wrong.
Good song
I started out not liking Morgan Wallen with all the controversy earlier in his career....... But you can’t deny he can sing!
One of my fovorites you can feel all the emotion
Just ended a 6 year relationship this morning and even in all my anger I still apologized to her for me wanting to love her as much as I did. On my way to work later this song came up and I completely fell apart. She made me suffer and I never owed her a single sorry, but I always felt obligated to apologize so that I could keep the relationship I desperately wanted to continue. My heart and soul are both completely shattered, but this song definitely is going to help me heal as I find a way to move forward. Thank you Morgan.
❤
Tbh ... ughh I wanna crawl into a little hole then die.
I can sing the song that’s how well i know it
I love this song I wish he would have came to the rodeo I would have picked him to go for my birthday out of everyone that was playing
He lives this song.  You can see and feel his emotions.  And you go right through it with him.  Just wow!
Love this song and Morgan , thank you for naming my 95 chevy  ss pkup , wasted on you .
Dudes making me like country. This isn't garbage
I have nightmares almost every night. Shit ain't right man. In my next life I just pray to God. I dont have the same feelings.
Hes wearing makeup
Sht hits the heart
Love this song. Can't get enough of it.
I feel this song has layers which makes it better
Awesome man love it
Great fan🤎
My son took his family to see this artist tonight in Bossier City, Louisiana...first time I'd ever heard of him. This song is just perfect - I wonder who wrote it?
Good  song
That song Tales my life
my partner turned on me the other day, and this song got me through yesterday. Today is the second day I feel lot stronger with song. - "year I swore this would be different my heart wouldn't listen ", "looks like im learning the hard way again'
Turns out you can't cancel a legend. Hell yeah, Morgan💥💥💥
Is this guy allergic to writing a bad song?
This reminds me of a verse in the bible where God shows people mercy and too many times it is wasted. God help me make something beautiful out of your mercy, something that would make You proud and smile when You think of me (and anyone else who wants this). Amen.
I heard this song and it saved me from committing suicide.
Amen good stuff!!
Algum brasileiro de bom gosto, que gosta dessa música maravilhosa? 😍🇧🇷
This song will always remind me of that special someone
As a 15yr old boy who lived through a 8yr divorce and had to do everything I can just to survive. The group I was in was horrible. Drinking, drugs, even sometimes sex. It's horrible. I remember walking a mile just to go get a drink because my dad's mind was focused on other women. And I slowly became an alcoholic. So I'm sorry for most people.
This song hits home. Regrets and emotions flood back.
This song hits home. Regrets and emotions flood back.
🤝
Think my ex would appreciate me forwarding this? I used to send her a song while she was at work everyday
Got drunk sung this at the top of my lungs neighbors called said I was dying from a heartbbreak
I love this song
I hope he puts this version out as the single instead of the rap/pop version
Hits close to home.
I love this song
El Dizzy D
honestly i am only 12 and i have literary loved morgan wallen music ever since i saw this world:)
0:40  He aint thinking about it. He's stinking about it.
This is the new single. I'm not suprised. Deep, jaming azz song.
I've been there trust me, I've been in 3 different combat zones from 1991 to 04and she was there with me but now after 34 years together she's not. Been through cancer to a heart attack
My buddy Andrew Elam just dropped his newest album early on YouTube. This banger is my personal favorite. If you like Morgan Wallen then you’ll like Andrew Elam   https://youtu.be/9U3XTg4fEs4
The emotions and facial expression coming out of both these guys is amazing ❤
also the background singer needs a solo career too cause damn
everything about this song is just so beautiful
It's just so damn catchy!
I can so relate to your songs, beautifully written and sung
Is he sober now ?

This song reminds me of someone i used to love. So heartbreaking yet so true.
My new favorite song and I’m happily married but I’ve been depressed myself. I love the melody. Godspeed everyone
Still listening in 2022! I feel every word he sang.  #iLOVEYOUUU  #MORGAN WALLEN

Man don't let nothing steal ya thunder, I have seen it all, had it and l8st it.. keep going continue growing love John hill
This song relates to me and my fake friendships
Just to let everyone one know. Morgan wallen is a fraud. He's singing songs I sang to my wife.
My wife can't know that I jam to this dude's poetry 😂
Thank you!  I kept blaming myself for my recent breakup and felt stuck. This song has turned me around and healed the pain in my heart,  a little bit a time. I am so grateful ❤
Singing from the heart!
Hear me out on this.... he needs to hop on a track with jelly roll!!!! What yall think.
Awesome song.♥️♥️
This man seriously got some talent ever since he started
I just love your voice... 💕 Your songs help me get through the hard times. Cause, I  Can't even begin to explain all the days I wasted on someone that didn't deserve it.. Thank you 💕💕
The feeling you show in your music allows your fans to feel. No eggshells, restrictions, allowances. Just feeling.
Odd that I instantly connected this to my dad (no creepiness) and not a girl… man I cant wait to get the “condolences” letter.
man this song is electrifying
This song is so good man✨
Great song. Man's a musician!
Goosebumps
cowpop
Omg. I heard someone sang this song on a karaoke and I was like who the crap sing this song. Now I'm hooked!!!!
I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SONG! I do not comment on this stuff very often, but boy does this song bring out a different emotion. Thank you for everything you are! This Song Absolutely Fricken Rocks!
After a 16 year relationship separation 💔 This song really makes me feel the pain and heartache all over. I love it and can't get enough of it. I feel like I wrote this for her😢
definetly a good son in a blacklight
Love his music
❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥💕
This is an excellent song! I'm a BRAND NEW FAN!
https://youtu.be/K2_ofrvNR3A
🎼🎶💔🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶❤!!~*🤙🏼
He knows his shit.
Everyone always tells my brother he looks like Morgan Wallen. Someone legit thought he was him once. Check out ClappedOutClassics and decide for yourself.
Love it!!!
Dammitman!!
All I listen to is country music, I have 3 different country music stations preset in my Cars radio, so if I'm listening to music it's all country music 24/7, now I'll be honest when Morgan hit the scene I really didn't care for him and didn't really value him or see his potential as an artist, But... When I heard "wasted on you"; I was blown away and my eyes were open and the more I listened to it the more I couldn't get enough of hearing it, the raw feeling and emotion he put into singing that song spoke volumes to his true potential, and the potential he has to be one of the greatest artists in the history of country music is massive, however it's unfortunately being overshadowed by the negative attention he's slowly garnered the last few years, Morgan it's not too late for you to make mends and right your wrongs and still have the successful music career I know you deserve. Good luck man we're cheering for you!!! Great song keep up the amazing work!!!
Tonight 😭🎶😭
Wonder who the bass player was, just showed fingers never a face?
Ok but his back up vocalist 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
That backup singer is DANGEROUS with those harmonies 😍🙏
Great song and amazing singing wow
Morgan is the man, I'd love to have a few beers with him
All these damn good songs I get addicted to ty bus driver lol
Thanks durk!
I was listening to this when it had 100,000 views

Unbelievable
This is exactly how i feel when i look back at my last relationship
Morgan swam through the virgin islands; now there's just called the islands
Let's go Brandon!

The only reason I’ve been able to fall out of love is this man’s music. Keeping me strong.
I'm hurting so bad this is helping to heal me slowly
Hii

You are you cute

This is more than real, how come I didn't write this 1st!!??
I need this version on Spotify pleaseeeee <3 <3
Can someone pretty pretty please buy me tickets to the Morgan Wallen concerts on February 4th at the Charleston Coliseum & Convention Center in Charleston, WV && on July 21st at the Pavilion At Star Lake in Burgettstown, PA. I'd be more grateful then you'd ever imagine. Thank you!!
Those who don't like this man, keep hating suckers. Go Morgan
1st few cords sounds like garth
he sounds even better when is live!
No time is wasted on you.even for a minute if someone makes you happy it's not wasted.
Just found out my boyfriend has been planning on leaving me with another woman. This song speaks for me. I don't have to say anything. This song says it all.
I've listened to this song 20 times in a row... Oops...21 times
Nobody’s gonna talk about the backup vocal’s? On point!!!!!  Love Morgan’s music…
Morgan. I dont even like the current state of country music. If i listen to country music i always want the classics. Hank, Waylon, Willy. But as I sat here and listened to this tonight it gave me memories of my past relationship and made me think. I appreciate that sir! you have a new fan sir!
Cool Song!  Man - steel
I have had to listen to this every day because of a nasty friend
This dude is amazing. Love Morgan..
That was perfect. I know I'm late, but i was able to match this up perfectly with Morgan Wallen's dangerous session of this song. Can't imagine how much work went into it!
Fr
HI!!!! I'm 12 and your music always makes my day better! Keep making great music!! Your songs bring me so much joy even if there sad! Love u
Wasted 11 years with someone that was addicted to meth. They actually turned me into an alcoholic so I would pass out at night  and wouldn't notice them up all night. Now I'm left alone with a habit that I never wanted.
Do you boy! ..do you! Ya got some ol soul down in ya!
Man, that´s so fucking good.
When you know you did everything right and it didn't mean sh*t to them. Now you're just so over it with a big FU!!
My girl broke up with me in 2016 n been single since
I listen to this every morning on a hour loop to just get going for the day...
I USED TO DRINK EVERY MORNING.  TO THAT NARCISSIST EX FUCK HIM
you wasted us.
KkOoa9a00aloa99a0a0o0apa90aooa99a99a9
I just heard this in dollar general and I’m glad I did
Sending love ❤ to anyone who needs it! breakup to breakdown keep fighting 💪
Its THIS RIGHT THE FCUK HERE that not "needs to be said" but because of the genius and intoxicating melodies of mr. WallERN (LOL) but back to the right now, this is some flat out medicine. Some that straight drop to balance our gentlemen peers who walked the earth a shell because they fell victim to a succubus gash that (I can only reference personal experience) but that trickbagged the man into a terrible existence that I pray all find the strength to mutually exit a toxic fairytale that happen so many times each and every cliche of a day.    Good form sir! You are the truth, you have a gift and I wish to thank you for generously sharing your craft with the world because take it for what you will but you've gained a loyal fan, saved my life and given me strength that wasnt another hopeless pipe dream or lie I told myself.
2022 anyone?
well thank you so much for this albume, but this song especially.
On repeat this morning 💔😢
you are my fav singer!!!🤩
I like this song
this song It’s OK
Music is healing... I love this song 🥰
His helping me threw a break up right nw
🩸⚰🐍💯
Someone show some love to the bass player on this track. Dude kills it.
Love this song so much. I literally can not hear it enough times.
yk i have never heard him mention a different truck brand other than chevy lol

Love you i no. U sorry we have all been there
Anyone else listening to this during school, no? Just me? 😭
Morgan Should sing this song with post Malone it would be such a perfect duet their voices would go so well together
Man is this the real Morgan wallet? Than if you are, my sister loves all of his ( your ) songs! She is like his ( your ) biggest fan
My feelings echoing this song...
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Rock Star!
Making me like country music again! Killing your competition my guy!!🤘🏾
He got me listening to this on repeat and i dont even listen to music!!!🧨🎯
Obsessed with thing song can replay the song over and over and over
Amazing talent
DAM BEAUTIFUL 💃
I'm so glad that Sirius\XM has started to play his music again. I've stayed loyal even throughout the blackout...which was ridiculous in my opinion.
Absolutely one of my favorites. Pure country no liberal concrete cowboy
What a loser. #CREEKSQUAD
He is the BEST!! Love you❤  love Michelle from from SW FL 💕   be safe you are wonderful!!
This song is my favorite I love his voice in it and the lyrics
Took the words out my mouth and put it in a beautiful song🥰🥰
Great song, still kind of poser that got his career launched from a Ring door bell.
Only 45 mil views let's us know AMERICA 🇺🇸IS FUCKED UP BLESS YOU MORGAN !!!
This every think stumped I did for my ex the 2grand I jus spent in the last 6 weeks to be kicked out and my heart wouldn't liss3n to my head or my boots and I'm back living in a caravan jus glad to have my dog with me and still get see to my little boy
This is a awesome written song
Morgan is a legend!!
It's the worst feeling ever when you understand the amount of time wasted on something so painful. 💛
I'm going through a really really hard break up and we dated for 1 year and and a month she was the best thing that has ever happened to I miss her so much 😭😭😭😭😭I can't move on its way to hard I don't know why good things leave I'm never loving a girl again I only want her but she is moving on and that hurts so much I just can't fall out of love no matter what
This song is Hot
About 30 seconds of this entirely forgettable, sing-through-my-nose-with-phoney-country-drawl performance, is about all I can take. It's completely beyond me how completely AVERAGE singers get to be called "Stars" when they're anything but.
CD
Still the only good thing so far In 2022!!!
At least 40m of the 45m views this has are mine. Amazing song.
Dude looks like a racist... his apology is straight bs, only to save his career... By looking at his mullet, you can tell he's as ignorant as they come lol
Man is he talented! The voicing is stunning! Keep on it man!👍🏻
Awesome voice and heart!
I just had a break up and I thought I was fine until I heard this 🥲
I’ve done sang this song about 1000 times  This shit hits hard not gonna lie
This reminds me on how much time I wasted on my father just for him to give up on all his kids he resecently. Gave up on us it's hard I wasted so much time and money on him 😢😭
Wow. CRAPPY SINGING. Sounds like cheap karaoke.
S☀️🌗🌤🌦🌙🌧🌗🌦🌙☀️🌔🌔🌤☀️🌔🌔☀️🌗
What if Jamie ray and Morgan wallen did a Collab?
Either he's been through a lot or he's a great artist (acting too)....the feelings on his face?? WOW!!!! I'm amazed. Love this song!
I Currently have this song on repeat. In the process of healing myself.  Hardest part is letting go of someone you love because they have proven time and time again, that they are no good for you. Practically 4 years down the drain of holding on to hope and change. This song is helping me get through.
Your range has me in my feels damnit man!! Get it!!
That man got me through the worst breakup of my life 5 years and 2 kids later but it's all good
Morgan Wallen is a racist don't buy his records or go to his concert. RACIST.....
Illuminati trap
‘Like this pile of your stuff that’s packed up in a bag’ really hits hard!!
Algum brasileiro aí que goste das músicas desse cara igual eu?
Just found  this  guy from durk 🎵  great  👍 singer!
Love this...
Grandma loves you grandpa and I dance every morning to this song while the kettle boils.. girls let the guy waste his money on you until he shows you his heart and soul keep him chasin ya.. good advice from grandma..
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

I have such an unhealthy obsession with this man 👀...lol 🤎
Terra evens

This système is hard And really control our lives  i love you baby The woman who is looking for herself ❤️
nice Morgan  Wallen
As a goth I secretly listen to this as a guilty pleasure.
Stunning
Beautiful truth, For you Cowboy
Who hurted this man 😭😭😭 shii got me sad
You that fucking dude
Listening to this after my fiancé after 7 years together because I was living w him feeling like I was on my own… It didn’t hit me til after I left and now it’s keeping me up at night…  I swear it was his doings and now I’m broken …
Makes my divorce much easier considering I wasted 3 years of my life on a cheater
Saw my ex flirting with some other guy in front of me this song helped me get through. These words are so true.
POV: ur a white girl
I love this song
Must be nice to copy jelly roll swag an hit number 1 on charts
2022 we're still going to jam this
This man got ME TO FORGET ABOUT THE MAN I HAD AND THINK ABOUT THE MAN I WANT
Bumped this Dangerous sessions all year!!
youtube version sounds better than the CD I purchased!
It got me through my two year divorce after 35 years of marriage.
Natalie carol Jenkins , you truly are the poster child of "wasted on you"  Guard your heart men and women,for the devil is a brunette and i swear by this. Was dating a porn star on the low and never knew until now.she used and abused my family and myself and is by far the biggest waste of anything ive ever seen. Wow. How did i not know smh.shame on me
These country singers need to use their real voices, instead of contrived vocal crap
Happy new year 2022
Hi I'm 9 and I love this song it's my favorite song I always listen to this   Song your my favorite!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well Wallen, my dude.... im 39 and I've decided that my new years resolution is to stop drinking for my wife and kids... Im going to used this song as a reminder... You sir, are a badass... Stay safe and Happy New Years everyone...

What's the controversy with him using auto tune? In some comment sections it's a Hot topic.

Brother your music is the best I have heard in years as a Knox baby I'm by your side man keep up the good tunes.
Morgan you are the shit
A
This authentic TN accent brings back memories from my youth, no one will EVER pronounce my name like my grandma did… “Keeely”, I miss her! Hats off to Morgan Wallen, for staying true to your roots! And may that TN moon continue to shin brightly upon you! Hoping to get back to Knoxville soon and re-look out over my family’s “Sharp’s Ridge” land.
Love from India 🇮🇳  Navi Mumbai  400705  Lee  That feeling when u hear this song  Only real heartbreak soul can understand 💔
Love his voice...getting me through!
Sounds like me. After a 6 year with my ex this song has helped me because after finding out what she did to me after all these years and then getting thrown away like trash because of what I found out and its my fault ok ill take blame and i hope she is getting what she wants now and its not me lol.

I've spent hours wasted on this song, it's so addictive! Love his music, his style, and his voice.
My cousin has a crush on you
Morgan Wallen is the Kacey Musgraves of Kacey Musgraves.
UPCHURCH
Awesome dude! Where's I'm at today!
Im losing my fight tonight.
Here from the Durk video 🤟🏾
Durk brought me here
Flooded with emotions and flashbacks. My childhood. My first love. My first, second and third heatbreaks. My accomplishments. My grief. My wonder. My goodness. My battles. My victory. Thank you for the life experiences I have been given.  Music has been the most consistent thing in my life.
Best song ever written period.  George jones etc would agree
My favorite song!! & Love all his songs! He is just Awesome! Love Stephanie ❤️
First time listening to country music. I love it 🔥
whos here from lil durk song
Durk put me on I ain’t gonna lie this man go crazy
I’m here from the the lil durk ft. You killed that song 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 now I’m a fan.
Love the flow in the beginning
My dad's favorite song
Here cause of Durk😂
Lil Durk brought me here
Why you said stanking I thought it was thinking
Good one Morgan!
Hey Morgan I thought you was country ? You made a song with durk durks city  are you city I’m not
Fine he said the N word idgaf this songs a smacker on meeeee
This got me through a break up, like a man should 🤝
This song makes me wanna get blasted drunk
Your music is inspirational bruv
I'm not gonna lie. everytime I get sad or in my thoughts I turn on this song and it slowly helps. I dont care about the money I've spent on people but my time? I cant ever get that back. especially with my sisters ex that took her life three years ago. I dont know how else to cope with it besides music
Thank you from MEMPHIS Angel Tree ....you know what you did ....now, if i can get a couple of tickets I have a cousin that wants to marry you.
I hope my man never forgets when cancel culture was trying to cancel him we sent his album sales up in support.
And to think that all of Nashville black listed this guy for saying the n word in the privacy of his own back yard. Shame on you Nashville and everyone else who tore this amazing singer and song writer down. Now everyone is realizing they made a big mistake since he went what 11 or 12 weeks at #1? More then anyone other singer or song writer. Keep your head up Morgan we got your back. The ppl really spoke and let the industry know the fucked up. Congrats on all your achievements
Who is here after Broadway Girls 👀
Here from durk 😂🔥
Man just renewed my lost faith in country music!
Fuck cancel culture, and fuck majority of my millennial brothers and sisters who are weak and utter embarrassments to the past strong generations.
Straight vibe
Im feeling this song x100
Finally letting go of my ex and this song is just 😮‍💨
I am from Europe Bosnia and Herzegovina 🇧🇦  This song is my team song  I play it on my way to work ,THANK YOU  FOR THIS SONG 🎵 THANK YOU 😊
Another great one!
got me threw a break up. thankyou "all of this time and all of this money all of these sorrys i dont owe you honey" hit hard dude
Karaoke night song...I sing it perfectly in my car...just my opinion
I think about all my exes
I don't even care that you are racist, this is just bad country. Simple and generic.
I’m gonna play this to my future ex wife!!
I wouldn't even be mad/offended if I had the privilege of being the one that he wrote the song about, but then again, if I had the privilege to be with him , I surely would do anything in my power to make him happy lol 😂
When is he going to realse his song Broadway Girls?
Love his voice love how relatable this song is!
don't sound like country music to me sounds little bit more like a rock band
Love song
I really wish I could beat depression. But its beating me..
Todo lo que hace es arte.
So talented man. Cut the racist shit and get back to good music.
10 years together got nowhere now separated geese doesn't this song hit Home
Morgan you always show up when I need it. Thank you my man. I live in your hometown of Gibbs. Wife is gone. But your music remains.
I broke up with my girlfriend just so this song could have significance in my life
I frecken love him!! Hes voice is addicting !! sexy ass hell too!!
Let me tap dance to this song on one of your stages in Kansas
Don’t usually listen to the genre of music but came across this live on tiktok and it’s so catchy I love it!!
I genuinely like this song
*looks away... and closes eyes* ....
Dude is absolute trash. This is country music's next big thing? 😂😂😂 no range.  Same song we've heard 767 billion times. Gtfoh. What a joke
The love of my life of 7 plus years dedicated this master piece to me once we broke up... Ever since, this song hits just a bit different... What a beautiful deep song...
🥺 learning the hard way
I needed this in my life. thank you
0:43 he says "stankin bout you" LOL
This song hits so hard right now😰
This song is getting me through the roughest time of my life. This divorce I'd really taking everything out of me. Thank you Morgan!
My God son you wrote that for me .. My wife is above us car accident,I cry every day. But that song goes both way when you love someone that.. I'll never take me ring off honey ...
Whoever down voted must listen to cardi b and lil nas x.
This is amazing! Could you please do a cover to lonely lullaby by owl city?
I wasted everything and myself on you Hannah. Never again.
This version has to get on spotify. The one on there now is just too computer generated for this kind of song, the real instruments in this version just bring it to a whole different level.
I'm going threw a nasty divorce from a narcissist man. This song is stuck on replay for me❤️ makes me feel a little better each time I hear it💯
The guys got a refreshing sound
Morgan Wallen is the goat change my mind.
Cliches, cheese & lowest common denominator… 😂
After i heard this song i became obsessed with Morgan Wallen and this opened the door for me for Country music, and i feel like thats all i listen to now.
My soul feels this
Not bad but would be a lot better if he would ditch the fake, pandering country twang and sing with his natural voice.
Another no talent loser that's built a career of trump domestic terrorist
Theo Von got me here
I can be having the worst of days and listen to Morgan and it seems to get better with each song. This song is my theme song for my last 10 years!
He's like a gayer country version of Taylor Swift.
I am about to weather a storm that's been brewing months now. Unavoidable. I always felt unbreakable until now. I wished for her and it came true. A for real dream come true. I call it soulmates. Nothing last forever.
He’d be great if he wasn’t a racist 🤦🏼‍♂️
Going through this shit now... Bullshit 15 years
Daniel Winters come home please Jesus so our kids are not alone I love you all no matter what!!!
my friend at school Aarilyn Lock loves his music
Man this song is crying for lil nas featuring
8
i listened to this song on repaet for at least a month straight....I'm still not tired of it (I don't think I'm capable of getting tired of this song) I've never been through a breakup before but this song is so fun to sing
Morgan
This man is a legend before his Time! 🔥 🔥 🔥 Lead guitarist is so on point with him it's special!!!!
When life tries to cancel life…………………………
Stay up, Kings. The real one is on the way. 👑
I love this song
Wasted plenty of time on a girl most of my highschool life, ruining relationships and friendships with people just for her that didnt even work out, 3 years wasted. Im thankful that ive reconciled with those people and im in a better place. This song helped me get out of that emotional mess i was in going back to april 2021. Most Morgan’s actually helped me get through it. Hes such a special artist and will always be one of my favourites 💯
this sucks ass
I’m 18 years old with a baby and recovering for a bad drug addict and this song was a reminder that I don’t need to waste my life on that bad boyfriend and drugs thank you Morgan wallen your my hero keep making legendary music your doing a great job  I love you
I’m 18 years old with a baby and recovering for a bad drug addict and this song was a reminder that I don’t need to waste my life on that bad boyfriend and drugs thank you Morgan wallen your my hero keep making legendary music your doing a great job  I love you

No dislike 🤯
This song makes me cry story at 200 likes
My #1 song on Spotify for 2021
Almost 2022 and this song is still a masterpiece
And some how juke combs gets the best  album of the year award when Morgan fs won hands down
It’s one of those times where you love someone more than anything else, and they know and it just goes on but they never give that love back but you can’t let go. Hurts so much
He’s helping me Through my break up thank you man keep up the good work
LOVE
not the forced accent lmao
This is getting me through things and is helping me see things I thought I would never see
I just want her back man
This song sucks.
This guy is just flat out a great singer
I love singing your music. I can have the worst day and turn this on and just belt it out and it's like all the crazy that's happening to me just leaves me when I sing this!!! Thank you for you amazing songs!
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔😿😿😿😭😭😭😭😭
I'm glad the mullet made a comeback. Wish i could pull one off... :/

💚🌸
Best country artist
Fuck you adds
😭 💔
I’m just so in love 🥰
He kicks ass sorry for the language
A. Very favorite song of mine ;) sing it white boy ;p love
Morgan keep pushing your music brother. I grew up with every race comments don’t mean shit these days. I’m not the best of people but people have one voice don’t remember silence yourself for the sensitive ones. If they have anything negative to say about the truth then they don’t belong here
What up with Broadway girls man please drop it in let me know where I can get it from
You were your voice is so good
Love his music 🎶 🎵 ❤
u got problems!!
I can relate to this in so many ways. She knows who she is 10 years down the drain for someone not even close to the Man I am
Morgan wallen is really all I need on my Uber Playlist.  #Facts
Your music makes me smile at my sorrow God Only Knows how much I relate too songs like this. I woke up too " Whiskey Glasses" for 2 months in jail 2 1/5 years ago  and this song made it feel like yesterday again. Much Love & God Bless Brother 🙏 #FOREVERHEALING
I wanna hear Morgan and Miranda do a duet!
Thanks morgan
I love this w
Hell yea bro u help me through a breakup
brooo i have been trying to find this guy and this song since the beginning of the year  i just couldn't remember the melody and the title until i recognized the audio on tiktok
If there's one song that's helped me through this ongoing divorce this is it.
I love your song ❤️
Help them like i helped you
every penny of every concert should go to free Australia
In my Chevy  Smoked a fatty.   That easy AWSOME!
This dude is the best
Man this song tho.🙌🌹
No it's all those days that u done helping someone else while they heal & the one didn't believe them but about when they said u should dump that one u with cause he no good for u & find out that they still wanted u but now it's waisted time away from not listening to them when you I should have done before letting go of one who heart was holding on as he was healing from something else...
Absolutely love you all the way from Australia 🇦🇺💕
Windows down radio up riding by her house don't even look
I love his voice and love pretty much every song. Incredibly talented.
Racist
Woooooop  hooooooooo love it ❤❤❤
this is not good music
Wish I was going to be there he’s badass 🤘🏻🍺🍺🍺🍺
My granddaughter  loves this song
i feel the words in in this song
isn't this that racist?
FALLEN FOR WALLEN!!
I think he read my mind when he wrote this song! So talented! Awesome! Inspiring!
Yeah this song..and his voice does alot!
Yo I just sing 🎤 and play it amazing I’m so proud of you 👍🏽
When is your next tour
Let's go pops good time bar ladies
Makes me want to have a jack Daniels and coke
Love this song
Morgan you have one of the most talented voices I have heard in a while with all of the new country coming out. You having that bad boy country look doesn't hurt either!!!
Just found out my wife of less than a year cheated while I was at work. This song hits me big time right now.
I'm listening to this because I heard he said the word NIGGER. Great music. Full support, brother!
Strong lyrics
This is the only thing that gets my niece to sleep
Voice alone he’s truly one of the most talented artists of his time
Upchurch is better
Damn this man had me going through a breakup without even happening yet 😭
Courage & Bravo ... mec !
One of the best new artists out there. Perioddd.💯🖤
I thought I owed him everything I bought him anniversary’s bday Xmas lol I couldn’t get nothing so I bounced and now I know I’m worth having I just hate it that she will hurt him lol no I don’t I hope she hurts all three that played me for a fool
Got in a car accident while listening to this song
His voice is like 🍯 🤤
Felt trapped in a relationship for 4 years. It’s finally over and this song digs so deep into me. It makes me feel so much less alone. Thank you
I wasted 10 years on wrong relationships. Cant get the time back. 😩
My internet is running slow,  must need some FIBER.  Only in #Arkansas  Covid Zombies
Lyrics🥲
Dang
Mobile Alabama lets gooooo!!!!!
I learned him from tik tok
He gets five 🌟 stars! 😊
The concert venue at North Little Rock's Simmons Bank Arena Is internally scalping TICKETS!!
He played last night at the fair grounds, the amount of ppl was crazy. Over 40 thousand in that one area, that's the biggest crowd we have had here in 20 years
I love his singing
This song nails my 2021.
god bless morgan! 💋
Hey racist guy (: 😔🙏🏽
I love this song!! I'm single and haven't experienced this on any side but I love this song. 🖤
Im from the UK and my Best Friend lives in America. Her name is Haley. We play Cod Mobile together. She shown me this Guy  today and i am thouroughly impressed. She watches these a lot as Morgan is her Fave artist, so im hoping if she clicks on this video she will see my message. Hi Haley 😊
Honestly I’d rather something you can dance to. Every country album has at least 5 ballads. I think it’s the law in Nashville. So lame, so boring.
damn, i'm not a big country music fan but this is pretty damn good.
Boy probably could have won entertainer of the year if he didn’t say the n word
I like this song a lot, but the emotion in his face gets me so bad in my feels!!!
I love you, Morgan. Lots of people do, too!
She probably saying same thing 🧐
[Verse 1] I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Aw, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you  [Pre-Chorus] Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault Yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinkin' 'bout all I've wasted on you  [Chorus] All of this time and all of this money All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew All them days I spent, wasted on you Wasted on you  [Verse 2] Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learning the hard way again That's why I've been wasted on you  [Chorus] All of this time and all of this money All these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent, wasted on you Wasted on you  [Bridge] Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you, wasted on you Wasted on you, wasted on you Wasted on you  [Chorus] All of this time and all of this money All these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent, wasted on you Wasted on you  [Outro] Wasted on you, wasted on you
Never listen to your music. But when I heard they was tryna cancel you.   I came to support you and drive your numbers up
Please come back we miss you here in California
Damn what a beautiful song. I love songs with a story. This one rally touches me 😌
Step 1: Left Click Video Step 2: Press "Loop" - You're welcome
This needs a remix
I love Morgan Wallen.  He has such a soulful voice and hope he gets back where he belongs.
His band is amazing
Omg voice 😍😍
wonder if he realizes what he's singing...sound pretty crazy if you think about him selling his soul...singing to the record company..
I am going through a break up and this just made me cry
This  song is like a heart break 💔  I love  this song so much  I am on wasted on you
This dude is epic. Recognize.
Where’s Broadway girls?? That shit is fire.
Big hugs and Lot's of love and support for you. And Lot's of luck on your tour's
Mood for the rest of my life. I got my kids that’s all I need.
I don't even like county music but this hits different
🤠🐴  NICE!
Perfect break up song
Good stuff!
I think it would be cool if he sang a song about single moms. I'm a single mom.
Such a great song the woke mob couldnt kill it
This dude snapped on this one
Guess I'll say it. Serious Garth vibes here.
Beautiful ❣️ Nuff said.
This kid is gona be Big
🎧💖🎧💞
lets go Brandon
He helps me just let all of my feelings just go away
This touched me all the way in Kenya🥺
Got me through an awful break up where he cheated ❤️
You can tell in his eyes he knows who he’s singin about it ain’t just a song
The joke of a Prime Minister of Canada gets caught wearing blackface 3 times, apologizes and remains in power yet this talented young man gets shunned and Cancelled? What a world we live in indeed!
Number 1 new favourite song and artist
I just want him to sing to me every morning
Bro this is so bad
My favorite song. And the back ground music goes perfect with the lyrics.
My baby moma sent me this song dis mornin and it's been played over an over since it came thru  I'm sorry bm for not being the best man I shoulda been
I have nothing but a great appreciation for the woman I will die for to feel sorry for me she is just to much woman for a loser
best singer of all time period!!!!
27 years wasted except for 2 wonderful kids all a big lie. WASTED ON HER
Let's go Brandon!
MORGAN ❤️❤️
Lyrics  I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Aw, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets to burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault, yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinkin' bout all I've wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys' I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this chevy and prayers in a pew, all them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen To my head in these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again That's why I've been Wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this chevy and prayers in a pew, all them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys' I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this chevy and prayers in a pew, all them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you
Come back…..& let the politics go.
This sounds so much better than the studio version! I hate the base track in the studio version. These raw cut versions really show the talent of Morgan and the band!!
phenomenal song..great lyrics and harmony
True story❤
My wife just left last week after three years of marriage left a home a family for a new man and love this song has helped me so some light
Dang, Wallen don't miss.
Thank you, Mr. Wallen.
I don't even like Country but this song is FIRE!!
❤❤❤

Loving me some Morgan Wallen ♥
I know this sounds really lame, but I LOVE THIS SONG! He is also pretty good looking too.
Black girl from chicago here! Love this song. Whew! I def needed to hear this today. Made me ball like a baby.
Where does one begin when commenting on such a masterpiece? Awesome song!
Love this song! You are AMAZING! F*ck this cancel culture BS!
If I could keep liking this song every time I played it..
Morgan is an unbelievable singer, but I would enjoy hearing his guitarist sing this by himself, he sounds great too.
Hey bro. My fiancé loves you. She was in a bad car wreck .We have a family of 5 and I think it would change her life if you could reach out to her. She is an amazing mother. Thanks man
Goosebumps!!!!
He’s coming to Lexington, Ky in December an I can’t wait.💙
This man just help me with a big breakup
My jam
This song pulls me through
Killer song and voice!👍👍👍💞
This is my shit
I hope Morgan live's longer then me and keeps writing the songs that speak to my soul!
I just know that he didn’t use it in a racist way and he uses it like a lot of kids use it everyday without any racial meaning. So I think it is stupid that they “canceled” him. I’m ready to move past this and go to his concerts and watch them sell out like bad bunny’s concerts
This song hit me so hard after a break up of 5 years. This album got me through the roughest times. Not fully recovered but a whole lot better than when this first came out. Easily #AOTY and it’s not even close.
Just split up yesterday, phone died in the truck today I usually listen to rap off of it out on the radio and heard this and haven’t stopped listening since
Real shit guys my 2 year old cat just died unexpectedly and I'm listening to songs like im going through a heart break 🥺🥺🥺🥺 Take this feeling away pleeeeease.
The dangerous sessions should be released as an album, every song sounds better than the actual dangerous album.
Morgan and Post should do a remix of this song
THERAPY 🥺😭🙌🏻
Such a talented artist its crazy.
6.8k blue-haired SJW’s on here with that “dislike” button 😂😂😂  Nobody does it like Morgan…thank you baby Jesus 🙏🏼❤️
Let's be honest. This is the ONLY VERSION of this song.
What's your Instagram
This man gets you through more than a heartbreak
He is the best country singer!🤠🥰😍
This is amazing.
SINGING ABOUT THE LIFE YOU STOLE PSYCHO ???????? STALKER MURDERER THIEF!!!!!
Perfect he's awesome
This man's power comes from that mullet.
I feel like this is me soon I never wanted this .. I tried so hard.. but let him tell it it was me
I waisted 18k on my girl.. spent a 1k on a engagement ring.. moved her out of a 1 bedroom shit apartment into a house.. bought her a 14k 2018 civic that she totaled just for her to cheat and leave me lonely and losing everything.. all I have is my truck my gun and my dog and this bottle of 101.. don't know if I wanna keep going
So much for being “canceled “
This resonates with me so hard. I remember hearing this off IG when it was still in the works and it hit hard then and is the same now.
I don’t normally listen to country I’m more of a rap person but all his songs valid Fr
He sang deep in his feelings on this one
The groovy lift correlatively kiss because seal microcephaly wail pace a dazzling latency. cowardly, guarded pink
What the cmas did to you was a disgrace so don't let them prudes
Absolutely beautiful 🥲🥲 please don’t stop bringing to us…..
That voice…Jesus❤️❤️❤️❤️
Get your record back
I’m listening to this for my future heart break…
Going through a break up with my ex boyfriend has help me so much we dated for three months
It was not wasted
I love this man . I lave singing some of his songs. Some remind me of things that have happened or HAPPINING. Love you Morgan!!
yeah likemtha eight dollars at the stupid kangaroo park
You won't learn your lesson until you stand in front of a judge, in a divorce court. You lose your kids, your house, and most of your assets. Remember this young men... marriage for a woman is an investment. Marriage for a man is a liability. Don't believe me? Go learn the hard way!!
How can anyone dislike this man or any of his songs?
I love this song
Helping me through the fact my wife left me 😞☹️
I wish I could hear this song for the first time again, so damn good!
Missing my baby iloveyou she just din know how much means to me he is my man  she my heart
Just lost my best friend and I love miss my boyfriend and my girl friend ilove thendo much imiss you baby
Learning the HARD WAY AGAIN...smh
This song is gonna help me through the rest of my highschool journey
U saved my life tbh
After failed relationships over and over again must be something I’m doing. 😘 on repeat.
💜💜💜💜
🥺
💚💚💚💚💚
He sings from his heart! I hope he can find himself.  I was introduced of his music from my son who relates to many of his songs. Just touches my heart so very much.
This man can sing!
I don’t even care for country, but this song is super catchy. Shout out to the backup singer too.
Damn good song bro!!!!! On point!
I'm going round liking all relatable comments 😊
I was giving false hope that he cared about me, just to find out I wasn’t important to him wasted 5 years because my loyalty to him ❤️‍🩹
Do you know Miss Sarah Dockery me with the blue Jacket with the smiley pink faces on it
Looked up white culture, and as I browsed tractor and inbreeding sites. I thought surely this way of life has a soundtrack, so here I am.
My theme song💯💯💯
His backup singer isn’t getting enough credit 🔥🔥
I'm 65 and gone through this a few times. I felt the same way until it brought me to a relationship that I'm so blessed to have now. All those "wasted" relationships showed me what I didn't want or need so maybe they weren't wasted.
Mate this song makes you think hard and straight❤️
Keep killing it Morgan
My God I Love His Voice/Music
Hey Wallen... Idk if u gonna even get this but just wanted to say ik the feeling of the excitement and then the worse that comes with it with the self beat down and jus bein with self when you don't wanna be..... But God love us and you are important wo the music scene too... Don't let it drag you to think differently bro... Your music good but everything in music ain't at times if you know what I mean... Idk you personally but I said a prayer for you and shii I love ya brother jus stay humble and we'll be arite😁... With love and prayer always,, Jesse Lone
This entire album is a banger. I listen to it on repeat...
All my times I should been, but I wasted on you!!
One of the best!
Mans went through some shit with the town sleep around 🤣🤣 nothing but bangers this man makes ✊🔥🔥
U want know this song first time awake up in morning listening to every day
This dude has some of the best country music around
I remember being there a few times, and you look back at them years that you wasted you're life for, and you can never get them years back there gone. And a lot of times when that happens you don't feel like you should even try again cause all them years before you never find the one that was worthy of you, and all the love you give, was really for nothing.  And some of us don't meet any body else to try and be happy and to truly be loved. You're years are all gone and besides that you don't feel like anyone would even want to be with you.
I’ll cry. When broadway girls is released
This is such an amazing song! Hits me bigtime❤️❤️
Morgan Wallet you are doing great! Come back strong. You are my inspiration I wanna be like you, I’m growing the hair too.
6 1/2 year relationship. Gone like a 5th of even Williams on a friday night. Song has been on repeat for the past couple weeks. Pray for me...
Hey I'm a big fan bro keep it up
My god have you ever made a bad song
I'm fan from Brazil
I LOVE all your songs

Morgan gets your soul in the right place. You all know exactly what I'm saying.
30 year's and I thought I did wrong.  Then I heard this. Makes me rethink it all.
This song actually did get me through my breakup
Love it ! Fuk'n Awesome .Lovin' the voices ,Lyrics and Guitar.Wow! Sexy too.!!
I just went through a breakup with a drug addict and this really helped me out
So fucking corny.. if you want country and not wannabe pop listen to chris stapleton this guy sucks
This is your sign, you'll get through what you're going through. Find a reason to smile today.
Hi, Morgan hope you are doing well. I haven't been feeling good lately. That's why I haven't been on here.
I don't even like new country but this guy has definitely got it right...
Someone told me about this song and I am going through a break now and I am finally listening to it and I am so happy that I found someone else already new man is healing my broken heart. Bryan and Jamee.
Yea he dropped the ball
How come nobody told me about him?! Amazing song that I can’t stop listening too along with your acoustic performance of cover me up — https://youtu.be/TsfDpW7PYN8 which is and I can’t stress this enough, absolutely beautiful!! I’m so glad I found you to help get me through the ending of my 18 year relationship..music therapy is real  and at some point it just clicks that I deserve love and happiness!!  You’re killing it and I’m such a fan!! ❤️❤️
I think he's cute.
I'm not gay but he's hot as fuck, and he is in his right mind. And really they band him from the cma?  That's fucked up! He should be president
❤❤❤❣🥰
How can I like this song more than once? There is just something about this song. The music and his voice is freakin perfect
Best current country artist by far!!! People nowadays hate so hard they find any reason to ruin someones career. Keep doing your thing Morgan. , 🔥
East TN fan here!  Gave up country music because it started sucking but you’ve given me a reason to listen again.  Love how you love East TN.  Keep it coming Morgan!
Poor guy got the world by the balls ,and keeps getting in his own way.
This is my guy
❤❤❤❣🥰
East Tennessee he is the best, play Luke Bryan he’s good but not like this Morgan Wallen is the best in country music
All these miles on this Chevy and what? Thats where I get lost every time. But dude dont trip about the "n word" thing. We still love you Dogg.
I remember hearing this the first time while I was next to my boyfriend at the time & feeling this sink into my skin . It hit so hard I never could look at him the same.
Please put all the dangerous sessions on streaming
Brother I love this I'm leaning it now
Will always love you Miranda May!

My nicka Morgan Wallen good song 🎵 song helps keep up the great work brother.
this song is fire
This goes both ways...oh yes it most definitely does...female sing this about a male.gettcha some of it ....
Wasted on you .oh how I can relate to well
Lyrics   I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Aw, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets to burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you  Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault, yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinkin' bout all  I've wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys' I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this chevy and prayers in a pew, all them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you  Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen To my head in these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again That's why I've been  Wasted on you All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this chevy and prayers in a pew, all them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you  Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you  All of this time and all of this money All of these sorrys' I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this chevy and prayers in a pew, all them days I spent wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you Wasted on you
Thak you for this song. I guess I am not the only one who feels this way. It's very comforting.
Qoowww crazy good
Killing it..... he can sing and pull off a mullet
So sexy ....
"I don't always wake up in the morning, pour myself a strong one.. but when I get lonely I do!....... Looks like I'm learning the hard way again!" 🎶
Beautiful music 🎶 so sick of hearing shit music and seeing naked chicks
Bro what producer heard this amazing song and thought "yeah we should add some trap beats to it"? This is perfection
Facing the hard truth that you cant hide from the future isnt easy. Emotionally being stronger than reckless decisions will come after learning the hard way for most men. Love you guys tho but better dayz are ahead.
Fire
Pure gold
this man can read a walmart bag and ill listen to it on repeat
God why I love dam song so much... All of these times I hit repeat💯🤷🏽🙋🏻
This is the song that gets me though my life
Uuuuuuuuuuugghhhhhhh *moans* I love this song
Wish this song was longer
Love his music
Had this song on repeat driving miles and miles........ The sad thing is you always come genuine and when you tell the truth they can't handle it and then your the "bad guy"...... I may have come to terms I may take a break from my dating life and just adapt, channel, and adjust myself to be the best me I can be........
All them days he spent waisted on you and he was in the pew praying and now he attends bible study in jail but I am glad your sober amazing grace amen
Waisted on you
This is the best song 💜 Morgan is da best 👍💯
Great song and his voice suits it. I would like to see the main backup vocalist and guitarist perform solo though 🤗
This man is great, i love it

I prefer this over the studio version on dangerous
https://youtu.be/zZeaS9rF21k
Wallen is quality music here to stick
I don’t always listen to country but when I do it’s Morgan wallen
Maybe it wasnt meant to be and everything happens because it happens.
This is one of those instant classics that will be around a long time... He should do an extended version that's 5 minutes long with another verse though.. It's over way too soon.
Over this weekend
Thank you Morgan Wallen god bless your band members and all the families associated with you buddy.
Me too
I call your breakups, divorces & raise you  a 23 yr marriage ending in divorce, & a work related injury on top
Shannon Macleod .
Still on Repeat!!!!!
Thanks Morgan, you just said everything I wanted to say.
I didn't give him a chance, admittedly. I'm so damn glad I did. This album is absolutely amazing.
This song has really grown on me since it came out. I used to not care for it at all
Eastern Idaho, Knows Eastern Kentucky. Why do the mountain residents of states get ignored.
I love him
i believe in multiple chances
A break up is one thing but memories just haunt u ugg fuk my ex😔
I really wish they would release a real drums remix of this song like this.
This song is the only song that can get me through the breakup I’m going through
The pain in his voice
How about a Lil credit to the man on guitar?  You rocked it dude..
Awesome voice 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I listen to this on repeat 🤷🏻‍♀️
Bad ass song!!! Definitely my favorite
The only white man that can say that can say the “N” word a still make me like him.
Can't cancel  talent.  Big fan
Theres some real raw emotion in this, just watch him, you see it. You hear it... 🖤
Yep
This is my Favorite Song.. Like I didn’t have one till Now 🤗❤️🤗
I’m in the process of going through a breakup that is toxic asf and this song makes me reckless but it helps
Dude is do damn talented.  And his band!   How I just now find it?
The radio needs to play more Morgan Wallen
I love this song!!! Straight to the heart ❤ appreciate you brother!
Request cover of  “anymore” by Travis Tritt  🙏🙏🙏🙏
Honestly, Who hasn't messed up and said something racial without giving a thought about it? Not realizing what you said? Black, White, Yellow or Red that you might offend someone else. Personally i was raised diversified and don't take words to heart.
Please don’t revoke my black card. This is a banger bruh.
Morgan does it all the time and never misses that beat
💪🏼💪🏻Boom he said it! #OklahomaSouth
Yo I had to remind and repost in this jam... Morgan!!!! 😎
Morgan I need you to reach out to me please. #OklahomaSouth
First time hearing this. At work and tears dripping down my neck. New favorite MW song.
I wonder how many ex couples both liked this song thinking about time wasted 😂
I thought I was hearing good music and then I heard this. 🖤
I love Morgan wallen...!! Keep them coming
This man got me through a breakup that has happened.
I'm sure singers and bands need money but shouldn't abide by media standards because if I was Morgan I'd have made any platform pay me for anything I bring to the table at a very premium price.
This song is very helpful especially going thru hard times
U get me to
This song got me through and is still helping me grt through the love of my life breaking up with me
He's going through sum shit
😩🙏🏼
Hello Morgan shoutout in Northern Ireland! Have you on repeat in the truck all day 👌
😘👌
Me and my girl just broke up and I said it was a Morgan  Wallen morning
Whoever sings with him is very talented too,
😓Wish i would’ve heard it when it first came out
Why is this version not on Spotify? I like this one way better
You can’t cancel my boy lol
This song feeds your soul 👉▶️
Wasted on u, wasted on u wasted on u ! One more time for the douchbags that we wasted our time on!!
I absolutely love your voice!….perfect harmony!
This shit hit different just went thru a fucked up relationship for 4yrs I felt ever word of this song
Me and alcohol. I'm a recovering addict. Sober for a year and half. I was gonna drink today but I heard this song and related it to me and alcohol 🍸.  This song saved my sobriety today. Thanks Morgan! ❤
I have a chevy
This man is the only reason I haven’t thrown myself off a bridge
Me and my baby momma just broke up today. Don’t really care because I deserved better. Just feel for our children.
I don't owe the BITCH SHIT!! Thanks Morgan Wallen!
Morgan you’ll never gonna read this but I really wanna make a song with you this song right here gets me every time I wanna make a remix amen god stay with you yessir
Morgen Wallen you are a great Country singer ever Jackie McAdams Amen.
My obsession to this song is unhealthy ✨
❤❤❤❣🥰
🇧🇷 alguém ? Haha
Vote for Morgan Wallen and Jason Aldean to do an duet/album together:
Man I can't get enough of his songs. God gave you a sweet gift. Music....
My wife left me 3weeks ago after 11 years and I've wore this song out. Thanks Morgan!
Needed this today
Support you tough guy. We get through this life a little together. Keep going
It’s so cool to know someone else from Tennessee is so famous
Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen😏🌾
Amazing song!!! ❤️
Love your music
Whenever I’m sad I listen to a Morgan Wallen song 😂 it somehow makes me less sad because I can LITERALLY feel his pain… making my pain more bearable. Also, a “little Willie” never hurt no one 😉
At first I thought he might be talking about a past relationship with a girl, the more I listen, it sounds more like alcohol Morgan’s talking about.
It's not wasted, we think we want someone so bad when in reality we are only fooling ourselves into staying. You have to go through some bad ones and make mistakes on the good ones to know what we really are looking for and how to treat the right one. So it's never wasted. I can say I have felt that way but looking back now every lady has taught me something along the way. If I changed my past and not been in one of those relationships at that time and then stayed single for so long I may have not been in the right place at the right time in life to meet my wife. 9 years and 2 kiddos later and there isn't a woman that walks this earth that can hold a candle to her. She is not perfect but she is my everything.
Love this song so much! You are a true musician! I can see it in the way that you sing your music, it's all over your face, and the emotions you sing with is very addictive lol. You really believe what your singing! I could watch you sing all day! I love love love this song! I could put this song on repeat! Your a very sincere musician! I love it & love your music! My grandson knows all of your music! He is the one that got me listening to your music!
He is so damn hot I can’t stand it 😜😍
He reminds me the singer of shanedoah
Where do you get this inspiration? I love you, Morgan!♥️♥️♥️🥺
I like listening to him helps me
My ex and I love Morgan wallen, and when we broke up this helps so much
Damn Son….
Amen
I think I broke my phone on too many. Repeats … Morgan continue being you
This man’s music makes womens panties drop! Love him
He sure can make me cry...
I would love to see a duet with Morgan and Miranda. Absolutely love him.💜
All of theses worries we don't owe you guys waisted on you waisted on you
All of this time and all of this money waisted on you Rusty . Waisted on you Daysha waisted on you waisted on you .
Jesus Saves
Fk my ex wasted 7 yrs bruh
Good county music nice job
This song hits me ...I'm in love with someone who never loved me. I don't think I'll ever get over it.
Really wanna send this to my cheating wife
This song  is some real shit I believe anyone can feel This hope it heals The pain 😉
Damn Man!  Wallen you nailed it again!
If he would make rap and country versions of all his songs he’d be #1 on everything.
❤️❤️❤️ love this song so much and all your music !!! You are so good ! U inspire me so much to keep writing music and keep chasing my dream❤️ going through a hard break up thank u for this song !!! I can’t wait to write my own songs to help others heal! You’re such an inspiration!!
Hi I hope you did a lot more songs, I listen to your songs while I drive the car. God guide you every day,
I’m confused as to why everyone thinks this guy is so great. He doesn’t write any of his material, he only plays glamour guitar. His only credit on his albums is “vocals.” He’s a country pop star.
Why doesn't this make me think of a breakup
WOW! I hear a young & jaded' Travis Tritt doppelganger. 🇨🇦✌🏻🎶🎸✍🏻♥️🇺🇸✨🌎
This song came out when I was going through a break up with a guy I'd been with off and on for 9 years. So toxic. This song right here, got me through it. I'm now in a better place ❤️ It still hits, just not the same. weird to say but even as happy as I am, something about being able to feel the pain of this song when I was in pain was beautiful. This song will always be one of my favorites, Morgan is so talented. Thank you ❤️
Imagine disliking this what a shame
Keep doing what you're doing. You have a legitimate fan in Dalton Ga that loves your music. I'm sorry for all the cancel culture stuff. I don't even understand all that, but I know good music when I hear it. You are a future legend.
Riding thru the city morgan wallen on the speakers... upchurch
Never again!
Awesome , exactly right
Justin Beiber's apology brought me here.
Obsessed
Sum happened and ur not on audiotape no more is cuz that dume shit that happed a few months ago
Sigh, Beiber got me here🤦‍♀️. I had no idea I was a country music fan TILL NOW. Holy wow
this the best song on the album
This generations "Beer in low places"  everybody... thats not a bad thing but you can't change my mind.
I haven’t gotten in a break up, but the girl I liked. We got into an argument and well y’all should know this song really helps cause I liked her for like a month after so. I’m 12  Edit: I’m over the girl I was talking about, Noah I like someone else. Chris jansons niece actually( we go to school together).
Hey
Damn...
Every song, hitter
Man just helped me go through a break up I love his music
I've had his cd playing in my car for 6 months straight. There are songs to wake me up on my way to work. There are songs like this to unwind in the evening. I've had so many different favorites♥︎ thank you Morgan. Keep your head up. Your fans love you. You will never make everyone happy. No one can.
Ive heard his songs, but never listened till this 1. Ive been missing out
Morgan is a goat and a kegend
Man deep sea diving sink or swim anti terrorism unit damage that was rough thanks for hating everyone see ya later
So talented. Great to see him at luke Bryan concert last night in Nahville
The eminent icicle inherently bare because boundary specially head out a yielding paul. plastic, nutty snail
Country Jesus & Combs '24! Make America Country Again! #MACA

Lord knows i would love to have some the wasted time back from relationships...
Whole song hits hard when a divorce is lurking.
Hard I love it
Thanks for helping me get over a breakup Morgan u are doing gods work
These the type of songs when the gang out the car🔥🔥🔥🔥
Helping me with a break up rn
totally thought this was a love song at first - HAH - think again!! Love it!
Hey man I'm not white completely multiracial but dude  mad respect for you, your music and I don't think k it's un appropriate about that stupid situation. Don't feel bad about it stop explaining and just move forward bro. Seriously though I only get racist comments for being part white from my other races than any other race.  They always focus on something so stupid. Perso al opinion why even show it the person that posted it is just as much at fault. Keep doing you bro, mad love and tbh  💯 FOR REAL AFRICAN-AMERICAN want people to stop using it than they do to. Lol I'm not racist at all siblings are part and they know it's just a word. Lmfao mad love for putting up with the only side people like to call out on the racist card and survival of their pitiful shit when I know personally how racist they are towards my part white ass. Lol so next time someone calls me a redneck that's black or brown or yellow I'm gonna expect to al.ost lose everything. Lmfao dumb ignorance so laugh it off and call me one if u ever see me to make my entire year 🤣🙃😂🤪
It’s that Nigga guy hahaha
🗣🗣
How did Morgan not win when he was on the Voice? I've watched that show before & those judges got it wrong with Morgan! It's a good thing the right person or person's noticed him & scooped him up. Damn what more could those judges have wanted? Maybe it was his song choices? I'm damn glad he made it, the guy can sing! I haven't heard one of his songs yet that I don't like. On his song Redneck Love Song he starts out & in one of the lines he sings...I got sum drawl in my y'all they cain't imatate it! ♥️ that part...😂😂
This has to be one of the happiest break-up songs ever.
I have a question for the ladies how do y'all get over it???please help me out cause I'm learning the hardway again
I love u from my sister
Aa
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wasted 2 weeks of my time on this chick that I won’t get back
Can he get any better than this album?
R _ C _ S _
I haven't listened to an album in forever. It's a beautiful thing when you can just ride. Well done 👍
I wasted years on someone I thought was going to be around forever...8 years wasted 😢 this song touches my soul...your such an amazing artist ty for this song it’s helped me heal a very broken heart 💔
I know how this feels
That. Voice. Though.

Super talented guy, made awesome song, he always has this spark in his songs...it helps during tough times..when u get wasted on someone

HERE WE ARE MORGAN FEELING DAMN SHAMED UPON OTHERS...
He should do a song called Baby The Wedding Song by Michael Bell.
This is lane gustafson
is my hound dog hollarin or is someone tryn ta sing beller
*It’s unfortunate that he’s a racist.*  I’m so tired of racist pricks. He’s not sorry that he uses racist words. We all know what he’s really sorry for.  🙅🏻‍♂️ 🚫
I'm n love
him using the n word brought me here.
Your a dork! Why are you on national TV apologizing! Never heard of you & I'll never listen to your! These people talking about a race problem, what happened within the past year with all these stupid BLM protests destroying people's lives! BLM=💩
Morgan is the best
Your trash
I am so impressed with every song this talented star puts out.  Beautiful music and lyrics not to mention performance.
Thank you for making great music! You don't hear great songs like yours too much anymore
This is helping  me  get through my now ex fiance leaving a week after buying a 63k truck together
Sent this song to my best friend to show her this masterpiece. She asked me what I was trying to say and who I was thinking about. Been in a relationship for 5 years 🤣🤦🏼‍♀️
still waiting for this version on Spotify😉
Only thing keeping me going is this song as my babies…
Morgan helps with my breakup pain
Damn i finally learned this on guitar and Im so happy 😁
All the ladies wondering where the good guys are at this what happened to those good guys

it's been some time since i have played a song over & over again, my new best country song & singer
Us country boya
Pp

This is the song we never knew we needed 😩
Morgan is one of the best artist in country music...all music currently. He is great, he is so great cancel culture idiots can't stop talking about him.
Finnaly someone brings real country back
I love you videos
Getting me thru a breakup that i have been used abused and left looking like a fool . smh good guys always finish last and get fucked first
All of this time and money that I give to help you better yourself! All for nothing but a bunch of regrets and wasted time. All wasted on you..  🙌🏻
M.B you were not a waste of time. 🥺 R.i.P i love you always...😟
When a man makes you cry, you listen. Dang, I wish this song got more play-time on the charts (he got a raw deal). We all ❤️ you Morgan!
So i live next to Coachella Festival/ Stagecoach ( I live in the City Where it happens which is not Coachella ironically but it Stands out more) I bought my stagecoach Ticket in 2019 for 2020 Since not only was Morgan Wallen gonna go but it would have been my first festival in the valley( I know i was Struggling Financially before but finally could afford it) and he cancelled when  they cancelled. So I cancelled Because even though i could risk seeing Great Bands like Old Dominion( Which tickets are expensive at the Casino they play at in the valley $300 for far back seats and i Love their song snapback, i had to cancel because Morgan wasn't gonna play at the rescheduled Stage Coach (before his Accident [ we all had drunk moments we are not proud of] . My military Roommate got me addicted to country since that's all he listens too/ Rap. From West Virginia, said he said he is never living in California but his girl got him Trapped on this coast now xD. I always knew Morgan would make it big since Up Down, even if his  First album  didn't make a big splash since I liked the way Talked( and I'm Mexican and i know we all take how we grew up to heart) and 90% of his first album. I just hope he comes back to Cali and i get to see him because Cali can be a whole different country. Bring him back to stage Coach Because im ready or just somewhere near south California because i still cant afford to travel up north or more then  1 day lol( I like Stage Coach Payment plan).
Same god I'm the fool for staying wish I could send the screen shots. But this happened on July 2 and seen a message of her and a guy talking about meeting up and fu**ing for hours and telling me she went to Walmart
Love this! Good job Morgan! Let's give it up for that background singer too! He's good!
I will always support you (Morgan Wallen) you are an amazing singer and you are an amazing person. You should be very proud of yourself. NO ONE IS PERFECT! EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES! WE ARE ALL HUMANS! WE LIVE AND LEARN!  Stay strong 💪 much much much love 💕
You’ve put so much time and effort in this song it really hits hard man. The guitar and your voice was so amazing💯💎💙
Replay button please 🥺🥺
I feel like that mullet got him feeling more country-authentic. 😆✌ love it
As long as I live, I will never EVER get tired of this song! That voice, the lyrics, the look -everything is spot on perfect!
Anyone else realize "wasted on you" means drunk on you and not as in waste of time... geeeeeez....
THIS BOY CAN SING. LOVE TO HEAR HIS SONGS

This one gets me Everytime. Especially when he says "sure as hell can't keep leanin on you" you can feel the emotion. This type of music is rare anymore.
i can sing this song better than he can no joke
Ok but who’s the guy to Morgan’s left?? That’s who I want to find

I like your song
This is the only thing that doesn't suck about 2021

This song is alot easier to take when you are married and happy after the witch you were with before.  This song made me remember that I forgot her...lol!
The only complaint I have about this song is it's simply not long enough, it's too good to be so short
Wow..this song literally stopped me in my tracks..im a legit fan...
Help me make it through all these walls I’m hitting.
I was blasting this in my car last night singing with so much attitude, feeling pissed off.....I’m happily married 😂😂😂
I had to see for myself why everyone is freaking out over THIS GUY? I don't get it. I mean his voice is just like any other country singer. That's all.
Wonder who broke his heart🤔
This is definitely a jam.
I loooooveeeee this song!

John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.

I wish this version was on iTunes I like it more than the album version

So afraid to fall in love again
I wasted 33 yrs of my life on a loser&cheater
My friend said they loved morgan wallen so I looked up his songs and this is the first of his songs ive listened to and wow I thought id hate it cause she said he was country but hes the type of country singer where its actually nice
This song honestly hit hard. I used to stay up late and waste my time a guys I didn't need, if only i'd heard this song sooner
The amount of love I have for this man's voiceeeee😩✋
This man got me wanting a shot of whiskey and a cigarette in a lonely bar and I dont even smoke lol
The "thumbs-down" people are just mad that someone is getting over them to this song.
Repeat this song and it’ll NEVER get old 🔥
Why is it that sometimes even sad songs are the only songs we want to listen to when we’re sad?
Absolutely perfect...
I think the people that disliked the song were trying like it and they pressed the wrong one and didnt notice
My break up happened 7 summers ago... this just brought it all back.
Let me just say his mullet is clean
Love this song man
Imagine experiencing Breakup  and your Brain can't forget about it because you have a Photographic memory
So catchy, wish I could write a song this good
I just wanna be a kitty sitting on your lap, can I be your kitty?

I hate country but he is really good
"I swore this would be different, My heart wouldn't listen.." DAMNNNNIT
Omggg I love you
I’m a straight man, but my god is this guy attractive as hell.
Wasted on you!!!!! Damn I can dig it! How many of us have wasted it on someone.
I like this version better than the hip hop official one
Gta bgm on that girl : *Wasted*
tfw the acoustic session is way better than the album version
Amazing.... love his voice ❤ 😍
This should be the version on spotify. I listen to metal 99% of the time. This is strait fire.
Divorced, 11 years taken like it didnt mean anything
Another good one by Morgan. 👍👍
Can I get an Amen!!! Love this song💔... 🔥 Fire
Who is the guitar player/singer in the video? Seen him before.
Best country album since Luke Bryan’s tailgates and tanlines!
Keep it up Morgan. You'll probably never see this but if you do... Your songs help me so much through a lot. You're amazing. Sincerely, girl from a small town outside of Knoxville Tennessee❤
Well I guess you cheated
Morgans been broken before it so obvious and its sad 😭
Love the guitar player/back up singer reminds me of myself love music but not wanting to be in the spotlight
Alright Wallen is 2/2 at the plate and they're both homerun albums. I fell out of love with country music but Morgan brought me back 👍💚
This song got me through doing everything for a female who is on games and wont ever give me the time of day
Heard this on the radio today and wow. As soon as I'm home I'm here listening
All I’m saying.... Luke combs and this man! 🤘🏼
Looks like I'm learning the hard way again
How can we communicate with Wallen's business people to let them know that the "Dangerous Sessions" playlist on his Youtube Channel is missing two of his accoustically-recorded songs. Secondly, we need a way to purchase them.I found out today, that it takes 3,750 ad-based Youtube streams to equal 1 album sale. I've probably bought only a couple this way lol, but I have purchased a digital copy for me and a cd for the wife.
Just announced by Billboard Monday, January 25....According to MRC, formerly Neilson Ratings, "Dangerous" was the number 1 selling album in the U.S. for a second consecutive week last week with 159,000 equivalent units; down from 265,000 in it's record-breaking debut week. It's the first country album to achieve this feat since Stapleton, November 2015, which ocurred for him not at its debut, but rather, after his CMA performance later that year. It is the first country album ever to sell at least 150,000 for two weeks straight. Also, it garnered the second most streams ever for a country artist in a single week (177.1 million) in history; a record Wallen blew away last week with over 240 million. The previous one-week stream record had been held by Combs at or about 102 million.
Ty for calling TO LAUGH 😂  It was your last Time TJB🐊 to ME !  To everyone else You’ve enjoyed the laughter about me So GLAD IT Finally HELP you ENOUGH to MAKE YOU MOVE & FINALLY BE HAPPY 😊😘🙏 so very Thankful ‼️

Tell me I can download/buy this exact version somewhere!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why would he have questioned ever putting this on the album Augh I love this song ❤️❤️❤️
I like this version better
Its like when he's singing he doesn't even try its like he's just sitting there having a casual conversation. Great talent
This man has never made a bad song, ever.
That sigh and alright at the very end....
I need to look up tour dates cuz omg. There is no words for this song!! 👏 amazing
My When Covid Dies Bucket List  #1) Go to a Morgan Wallen concert
I love him so much 🥺🥺
Your gone and gone 3 sheets to the wind his different everytime thx Morgan
This is dedicated to my ex, I won't SIMP anymore
I wanna go see him live who wanna go with me lmao 🤣🤣
He’s absolutely brilliant! He has such a warm tone to his voice. He could literally sing the phone book and I’d have it on replay ;)
Hey Morgan I love your music and I know you are going to orenge beach and I was wondering if I could get 2 backstage passes for 700$
Fresh out of a 14 year marriage with what i thought was the one. This song is helping me heal. Thanks Morgan Wallen!!!
This version is better than the producer version
Yes a song too my ex I will forever sing this
good jam
All of these miles on this Chevy
When he sang “all these miles on this Chevy” I felt that on a personal level
1:48 his little head twitch and lip poking out is just perfect haha I love it
Does he say “wasted on youuuuu oooHOE”??
Theo Von! You are the man brother!
My dog just walked in and poured himself a glass of bourbon
Sangin the shit out of this song.
This is country but old town road isn’t?? Interesting.
the billboard 100 chart brought me here
I needed this song thank you so so much
I listen to this song over and over
Welp, got a new favorite song.
I love him.
“The Dangerous sessions” hits me so hard, deeply in the soul. The “dangerous” album does nothing for me. So overly produced. Takes every ounce of soul out of it.
Exactly how i feel with my current situation. Divorcing after being together 8 years. I was completely blind sided
Feeling myself .. learnin’ the hard way too .. 🙏🏼🤙🏼greetings from GER
Keep them coming bro 💯
Shits got me crying fr fr
Hannah is his girl friend leave a like if you agree you are the best singer Morgan Wallan
Hit the Soul brother well done and sung... 🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻
It’s really sad to see someone love someone so much and u can’t get that same love back . He was in love with this girl and she tore him in many way that can never be repaired. Such a tearable thing to experience . Heartbreak is real and it’s getting more and more popular cause people don’t care about people anymore and that’s truly sad.
😔💛
For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that WHOSOEVER believeth in him, should not perish but have everlasting life.
You have solid gold country bars brother. I appreciate you
Love this song!! 🥰
hi I hope you are doing fine. I make music but it's really tough to have visibility when you're little, but I do my best to make my art known. I invite you to discover my beats and if you are not disappointed, do not hesitate to subscribe and share with your friends ;)
This man is legendary
The live versions should be the ones on the album lol
Best song on album
Really hope this version is put out. Less is more and the album version filled with a loud internet built rap track is not it. Simple instruments are what makes country music unique!
*Applause*
Me and my ex just split....it’s hard because I really love her. She’s the mother of my child. I just knew if I stuck around the situation wouldn’t get any better. Me and her are like fire and gas. But at the same time I’d take a bullet for her. It’s weird... but I just knew we weren’t gonna work. And I’ve never been in a situation like this before.. this song touches my heart and honestly makes me tear up a little. Lot of power behind this mans words and I can relate
Exactly how I feel after spending 8 years with my ex how just left me for another woman! This song is getting me through it!
So in love with Morgan and his performance here
You can feel this man's soul in this song. You speak for all of us brother.
I feel this so deep right now
I'm leaving tonight... In my dreams.
This song gets me in so many ways...
🐹🐹🐹🐹🐹
My ex dedicated this song to me where he’s the one who cheated on me 🤷🏻‍♀️
Perfect song😍😍😍🤔
Best country song out right now by a long run 👏🏻👏🏻
I needed this 7 months ago but I guess I’ll take it now❤️🥺
💖💖💖
Ahhh the harmony between them is mesmerizing 😍
you can see and hear how passionately he's singing. what a legend. ❤️
🌹🌹🌹🌹 my heart

https://youtu.be/tagy6FRlkJE

Where was this song a year and a half ago when I busted up with the ex after 9 years. Shit explains my situation perfectly
This man deserves one of his songs to be #1 by now.♡
Fucking goosebumps
https://youtu.be/fhVWAh6bSbc
Wish I was that mic 😂🎤
you can see the pain in his face
Congratulations, you got a new subscriber
Dude you got some damn great music! Keep it flowing...
Whiskey 🥃 for the soul on this , nothings more loyal than those Smokey mountains 🏔
Just remember she is not your girl it is just your turn.
IMPORTANT MESSAGE  This life temporary. What matters is where you'll spend eternity. You'll either go to heaven or hell FOREVER. Being a “good” person and doing good deeds won’t get you into heaven. The only way to heaven is through Jesus Christ because through Him we have forgiveness of sins. Accept Jesus into your heart! God LOVES US SOOO MUCH and created us to be with Him. But our sin separates us from Him. So He sent His only son Jesus to be the perfect sacrifice for our sins. Jesus died for our sins on the cross and rose from the dead so that we can have a relationship with God and eternal life.  If you believe that Jesus died for your sins and rose from the grave, surrender your life to Him today. He loves you so much. Talk to Him. Ask for forgiveness/ confess your sins to God and repent which means to turn away from your sins. Ask God to help you to turn away from your sins. Get a Bible, read it and obey it. Pray to God by talking to Him. Time is short. Jesus is coming back soon!!!   Pray something like this: "Jesus, I know that I am a sinner and that I cannot save myself. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and rose from the dead. Please forgive me of my sins. Help me to live my life for you. Jesus, come into my heart and be my Lord and Savior. Amen"   Romans 6:23
I like this one but I like the one you did alone
It is amazing how he comes up with so many double meaning phrases. "wasted on you" is another great one.  A true song writing genius.
That’s what a nice song sounds like- no swearing, no naked girls just emotions and talent.
This riff sucks and auto tune is turned to 11. GOD AWFUL
This song debuted at #1 on the Hot Country Charts and #9 on the pop charts. Wallen put six singles in the top ten of hot country. The previous record had been three. Twenty-seven of his thirty songs hit the top 50. That was also a record. He had 13 songs on the Hot 100 pop charts. Guess what? That's also a record. You name it, he broke it last week!
Immediately lost it
2:02 he ripped my heart out and kissed it all better and put it back very gently and now I know all I’ll ever need is this album and to marry morgan one day
.
This sums up my last break up
Never has a song been this stuck in my head.
I’m pissed his concert from the Ryman Auditorium got removed from YouTube!
Why are all of the best singers underrated?
Fuck Me.  I Love Him.  He sings the stories of my Life!

( *Romans 2:4* ) "Don’t you see how wonderfully kind, tolerant, and patient God is with you? Does this mean nothing to you? Can’t you see that his *Kindness* is intended to turn you from your sin?"  ❎ It's *Not* the Wrath of God that leads you to repentance. ❎ It's *Not* the Judgement of God that leads you to repentance. ❎ It's *Not* Hell or pain or fire. ❎ It's *Not* the punishment. ❎ It's *Not* his anger.  *romans 2:4* ☑ "It's the *kindness/goodness* of God that leads you to repentance."  ☑ God *Is Not* waiting to judge you.  ☑ God *Is Not* waiting to condemn you. ☑ God *Is* waiting to *receive you* with mercy, with love, with open arms.  ☑ *Jesus took* the Hell, the Judgement, the Punishment, the Wrath, the Pain, the Sentence that we deserved. ☑ God *Is Not* mad or angry at you and *will never* be. ☑ God *doesn't* turn away when you mess up. ☑ God *Is Not* an angry God. ☑ God *won't hate* you because you made a *mistake* one too many times. That's *Not* how he works. ☑ You are *Loved* by an incredibly *Merciful, Gracious, and Forgiving* Father. ☑ The *Bible* is about *You* and *GOD* ☑ God speaks to *you* through the *Bible* and the Bible is about you. It's all about *God's love* for you, *God's promises* for you, and *God's unending willingness* to forgive the mistakes you make. ☑ The *Bible* is also about God. The God who created *the world and everyone* in it. The God who saw what *he made* and it was good. The God who saw *Adam and Eve* fall into sin, and the God who sees everything you *do, think, and say* every moment of every day. ☑ God Endures. God *will never* leave you, God *will never* stop loving you, God *will be* your rock, God *will always* do what is best for you, God *will always* be by your side, every single moment of every single day. ☑ When God created you, *he made you* in his image. ☑ *Turn from* Sin, turn to God, find Life. ☑ *FEAR GOD* Jesus says you really *shouldn’t be afraid* of anything. Instead, *you should* fear God. WHY? Because God holds your *entire story* in his hands. And not just your story here on earth. God is the one who ultimately decides *where* you will spend eternity. But while you fear God, you can also *trust in his Son, Jesus Christ, who died* to forgive you of all the mistakes you make here on earth. On that day when you face God, Jesus *intercedes on your behalf* and reminds *your heavenly Father* that those sins were *wiped away with his sacrifice* on the cross. ☑ God *IS* Love. ☑ Before the *Foundation/Creation* of the World, *God knew you, God loved you, God chose you* ☑ God has the hairs of your head *numbered* Every moment of your life is *watched by God* ☑ It doesn't make any difference *how far* you try to run from God.

Glad to see someone who talks like I do bringing back real country sound merged with new country sound
I don’t even listen to country music yet this song is one of my favorites.
god i love this man
Apple Music please!
Beautiful voice✨💫☝👏
He's opening up for Luke Bryan, should be other way around. Morgan is the star.
**Adding this to my breakup song playlist even though I’ve been single my whole life.**
Am I the only person going through the whole new album? Like if you are to :)
Great singer
Man, that mullet can deliver a song, can't it? Lol....I guess the guy rockin' the mullet is cool too😂😂
Literally can’t pick a favorite but this beat hits different. 🤩
Vim pela Marília Mendonça❤️ 🇧🇷
This song I fuego🔥🔥🔥
this is just so much better then the album... i wish i could download the sounds off of this haha but  still dig the album just not as pop!
You are such a gift to all of your fans! Another hit Morgan-every single song is fantastic!♥️
Genesis Chapter 1 בְּרֵאשִׁית  א  בְּרֵאשִׁית, בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים, אֵת הַשָּׁמַיִם, וְאֵת הָאָרֶץ.	1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.   ב  וְהָאָרֶץ, הָיְתָה תֹהוּ וָבֹהוּ, וְחֹשֶׁךְ, עַל-פְּנֵי תְהוֹם; וְרוּחַ אֱלֹהִים, מְרַחֶפֶת עַל-פְּנֵי הַמָּיִם.	2 Now the earth was unformed and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters.   ג  וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים, יְהִי אוֹר; וַיְהִי-אוֹר.	3 And God said: 'Let there be light.' And there was light.   ד  וַיַּרְא אֱלֹהִים אֶת-הָאוֹר, כִּי-טוֹב; וַיַּבְדֵּל אֱלֹהִים, בֵּין הָאוֹר וּבֵין הַחֹשֶׁךְ.	4 And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.   ה  וַיִּקְרָא אֱלֹהִים לָאוֹר יוֹם, וְלַחֹשֶׁךְ קָרָא לָיְלָה; וַיְהִי-עֶרֶב וַיְהִי-בֹקֶר, יוֹם אֶחָד.  {פ}	5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day. {P}   ו  וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים, יְהִי רָקִיעַ בְּתוֹךְ הַמָּיִם, וִיהִי מַבְדִּיל, בֵּין מַיִם לָמָיִם.	6 And God said: 'Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.'   ז  וַיַּעַשׂ אֱלֹהִים, אֶת-הָרָקִיעַ, וַיַּבְדֵּל בֵּין הַמַּיִם אֲשֶׁר מִתַּחַת לָרָקִיעַ, וּבֵין הַמַּיִם אֲשֶׁר מֵעַל לָרָקִיעַ; וַיְהִי-כֵן.	7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so.  ח  וַיִּקְרָא אֱלֹהִים לָרָקִיעַ, שָׁמָיִם; וַיְהִי-עֶרֶב וַיְהִי-בֹקֶר, יוֹם שֵׁנִי.  {פ}	8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day. {P}  Agriculture skills pre-K through twelve all four marking periods no electoral no electives nothing less than Monday Through Friday     The computer they used during the fake moon landing was on a computer that only had clr alt enter and one through zero and last but not least 1 ram of fixed data  The amazing Mets was a deliberate act to keep everyone asleep while they began to form executive order 11490 oh yea same period of time as the fake moon landing  The combat of neuralink is the most important issue we need to collectively attack, the end of all starvation and homelessness and that the earth is flat     Minds of Men https://youtu.be/lWOa0oUCfVo  Neuralink  https://youtu.be/rInx6MQhxZM  neuralink dwave quantum computers starlink emp powergrids power outages in one simultaneous pulse once they feel they have enough people connected with neuralink in their pineal gland that’s what all the terminator movies is discussing right out in the open via cinematic pictures it’s easy to see if you truly are awake but everybody’s asleep and this is what they’ve been working on for centuries all the mk ultra monarch programming brain studies all leading up to this, this WON’T be a HOAX    Minds of Men https://youtu.be/lWOa0oUCfVo  Neuralink  https://youtu.be/rInx6MQhxZM   People often ask, what would they have to gain?

Love the new tracks! You sound  sooooooo nice! ❤️
Shueyyyyy.....
You’re welcome for the views Morgan. 1.6m and 1 million from me. 💙 thank you for the therapy.
Whoever she is, he sees her face when he’s singing this song...
Damn good song
At this point, I wouldn’t care if these speakers blow blaring this song 😈
Dope song! And I see you, Tyler. Killing it, boys.
Just WOW :)

This song is everything
That back up singer tho
Please do dangerous!
Another 🔥 👏🏻♥️👑Love it!
is this version on apple music
so good
this song is my anthem
Damn bro classic song
"all of these sorrys I don't owe you honey" I can't tell you just how much I felt that 🎯
Lesson learned, don't waste time and money on someone who lives 200+miles away on that Chevy.
I can listen to this all-dayyyyyyy
Very nice Music. 👌👌👌👌🌹
Well I just was sent to this one lol.. wow this is a great one.. always happy to hear from the best talent in the world today in music
♥️🎶
I farted
He reminds me of Keith Whitley but Morgan is updated it’s a new Generation
"All these miles on this Chevy IMPREZA..."  can't unhear it Lol
Thx Tinder guy for rec .
Another absolutely amazing song
Just announced today by Billboard: The new single-week streaming record for a country artist is now over 240-million. The previous record was 103-million by Combs, but it should be even more in my opinion. Even more amazing to me than how fantastic these new songs and voice and melodies are is how Wallen still has detractors and how this video doesn't already have 100-million views. There are actually writers and reviewers out there saying this album is just barely above average for the genre, too long, blah, blah, blah; and that we shouldn't buy it or subscribe in a world where far lesser quality products are out there killing it. Out of my top ten current favorite songs, at least five of them are in this set of 22 newly-released songs; and two more are previously released from this same album. I understand how people have different tastes and likes, but how can you not at least give credit to the song writing, melodies, and production produced in these songs. I challenge anyone to listen to some of these tracks, and then go try  listening to country radio. I don't get it except to say many must assuredly have a bias against him as a person or his image or behavoir and they're not looking at talent and technical perfection in these songs, because these sessions are top-notch musical events no matter how you slice it.
Such a beautiful man with a beautiful voice even his mullet is beautiful
"All of them days I wasted on you." 🤷‍♀️😪
All of these songs are so relatable its crazy. Loveeee it!
I feel like this is more about a relationship with substance abuse than an actual relationship
I only listen to rap with the exception of a few artist but definitely not country but I actually loved this song from the first time I heard it 🔥🔥
Because of the increasing rate that prophecy is being fulfilled, this world is quickly coming to a close. The great tribulation is about to begin, the worst time this world will ever know. God the Father wants to have a relationship with His creation. But everyone is born into sin and we need a way for us to be able to live eternally with the Father in heaven. Jesus made that way. Even though He is God, He left heaven and came to earth to be a sacrifice for a lost world. He never sinned. He was abandoned by His friends, was betrayed by Judas and handed over to be crucified. He was beaten so badly that He could not be recognized as a man. Then He willingly suffered an agonizing drawn out death on the cross. He was buried and on the third day God raised Him from the dead. And now He sits at the right hand of the Father and He is coming back any day now to Take home those who belong to Him. Just believe that He died for your sins.  You don't have to repent of sins. People who teach that, are wrong and they are not saved.  You don't have to give up drinking or drugs, etc. Just have faith that Jesus fully paid the price. After you are saved rest in Jesus' sacrifice. God will guide you and help you get rid of bad habits and to do good works according to His will. If you think you should do works, you're saying Jesus' sacrifice was not enough. Faith plus works will NOT save you. Once you believe that Jesus died for your sins, you will receive the Holy Spirit and you are sealed for eternity. Nothing you do or don't do can cause you to lose your salvation. Those who say that you can lose it are not saved. There is nothing we can do! It's all about what Jesus did! God gave us free will but He is a just God.  Rejecting salvation means an agonizing eternity in hell! In the great tribulation, the age of grace will be over and to be saved you must believe on Jesus plus resist taking the mark of the beast. Believe on Jesus now and you will escape having to go through the great tribulation!         I will try to answer if you have any questions.        For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16
I gotta learn this on my guitar!
YOUTUBE            ATRAK88
Oh Morgan Wallen, I love this song! Boy haven’t we all been there! Wasted time on someone!! Been there done that! I just love this song! No more wasted time move on!!!
the all the thumbs down were the ones who was wasted on.
I wasted a year!
Morgan has Angel's voice. I always get goosebumps when I listen to his songs😊😊
https://youtu.be/uw4MG1tbHVo Awesome video, Sir ! Masterpiece !
Yes I feel this
Jesus Christ loves you and He will save us from our sin if we put our faith and trust in Him! we all sinned and fell short of Gods perfect glory (romans 3:23) and the wages of sin is eternal death! (romans 6:23) but the gift of God is this   john 3:16-21: “for God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him. Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.”  and romans 10:9-13: “If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in Him will never be put to shame.” For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on Him, for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”  so God is coming at a time we least expect, and if we put our faith and trust in Him and repent (turn away) from our sin He will gift us His grace and clothe us with the righteousness of His blood (but of course death could not hold Him, He is risen!) and we will have eternal life in His kingdom where there will be there will be no more death, or sorrow, or crying. there will be no more pain, for the former things have passed away. because He loves you so much! (romans 5:6-8) but if we deny and reject Him and don’t repent from our sins to follow God, then we will have our part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death. so hear these words, repent and believe the gospel! accept Jesus Christ and confess your sins to Him so that He will forgive you and give you a life with truth, love, joy, and peace. which will never fade away or perish. this is all if you haven’t done this yet and Jesus Christ hasn’t saved you yet, also when you have time please you should watch this channel here on youtube called “Christ forgiveness ministries” and hear what they have to say, glory to God. God bless you! 🙌👑💟
Who are the haters that dislike this song... drop a comment because this is 🔥🔥
Can this be on Spotify? 🥺
Fire, I haven't listened to you alot but once I heard this song I'm hooked man. Love it all
I need this version on Apple Music ASAP ♥️
As a black man that lives in the hood  it brings a smile to my face when I get looks from my homies for playing country music. Amazing song man.
CANCEL TRAP BEATS!!  This version is AWESOME  Studio version, one of Morgan’s worst releases. No debate.
Love him!!! This is one my my favorites #MorganWallen 🖤
Morgan.. why are you putting trap beats on your recorded versions of your songs bro. That's awful. This version is so much better. Stick to this stuff man
Please keep making these types of songs!!!
Wasted my time for 28 yrs. Loved the dirt he walked on. Got sick and he just walked away. I'm better for it. Sometimes God moves us when we wont move.
That is a classy Aussie mullet.. sure he's not an country aussie
Morgans probably the most attractive person out here
"God is real. God loves you. God wants the best for you. Believe that. I do."  Chris Pratt
Amazing song ever
The way he did the money sign so aggressive like he was just tired of the bs
Original version is trash this version 🔥🔥🔥I will never listen to the original after this
Album version is straight trash, rap song instead of a badass heartbreak song you scream in the car
This version is fuckin 🔥 way better
Hits right in the heart 😭😭😭💔💔💔
The dangerous sessions as its own album with these versions id also buy
WoW not bad and i am not a country music fan good is good i guess
I pray anyone that sees this is successful in life
Could anyone else hear the start of friends in low places at the start
The whole album is🔥❤️
God goes into the body of a gay man, and people begin to leave churches, and the world abandon's God. God is doing voice's of devil's, and all witchcraft
God entered into my body, like a body. my same size. holy ghost baptism. God does voices of devils and all witchcraft and paranormal! hear voices? it is God doing
That's good.
I love him live better than recorded!!
Shew it’s 🔥
Tell me why my ex wife who's sent me several videos of her fucking other men and who has moved on and I finally gave up on after months of drinking myself to death sent me this now that I moved on
This song hits
Biden 2020
What a song I’m addicted
I LOVE THIS SONG
Terrible
This man just got me through a breakup that hasn’t even happened yet
Drinking or driving round in my Chevy cheers to you for singing our truth
You can tell from his face there’s some feelings behind this song! Amazing! You are my favorite artist
Morgan got me feeling about a relationship I never had
I don’t think you could make a bad song man I love your music and you  a lot dude you saved my life in a bad time where I didn’t think I could I could be helped and you help me a lot in that time and you didn’t even know but I want to have a jam session with you one day man I hope you see this cause I love you and your music so much
I was waiting for a song like this and who else but morgen wallen to deliver it
Joder que hermosa  cancion.
The only artist that has good music on the radio and better music that won't ever get played on it.
When he said “all of these sorrys I don’t owe you hunny” I got chills... because I felt that soo much!
YOHANAN(JOHN/JUAN) 14:6 "I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE. NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH ME" "YO SOY EL CAMINO Y LA VERDAD Y LA VIDA. NADIE VIENE AL PADRE SINO POR MI"......
❤️⏰💋
HOOOOLLYYYYY SHIT , that hit different in so many ways
I'm sorry 🦉🦉🦉
Best song I think he has ever put out in my opinion
Rocking this!!!
Target has been SOLD OUT since it came available now waiting for my order to get here
Yep, I can relate to this.....
Your voice are amazing <3
Honestly don’t understand how someone could dislike this song. Shit is fire. Mans put his heart into this.
Sing the facts of exactly what we do more than once.  HIT THE NAIL on the HEAD.  Although I’m not drinking over any wanna be man. Still wondering where  honest men are.
Not normally a big country person but damn if this ain't good!
Yeh he’s pretty good I love whiskey glasses 🥃
I'm not really into country song but this hits different.
.“Look within and be depressed. Look without and be distressed . Look at Jesus and be at rest.”
get this version on spotify please
The first 3 notes had me thinking Friends In Low Places  by Garth
Man!This is some amazing song writing.
It feels both #Devastating and #Awesome at the same time to see the number of views here.. Devastated, cause good music got few takers. Awesome, cause we're among them few 😎😀
Who's here after vevo dropped it's best if the week !!!???
This song is amazing
❤️❤️❤️❤️😭🔥
Anyone else think the first few keys sound like friends in low places ?
New subscriber here and love your songs.. Wow.
I love this version. Morgan is awesome either way.
I really hope he releases an acoustic version of the album with all these sessions on it. Some of the tracks on the album are great but have a lot of added effects that Morgan proves here - they really don’t need
I love Morgan Wallen and I really enjoy the album version of this song... but this version is sooooooooo much better and it's not even close
Couldn’t have said it better myself 100% truth
Morgan, make music like this!  No auto tune, no processing. Pure and raw. This is where you and the band shine man.
God damn this is good!
Potentially the best country music artist of all time. Love the album!
Right down to this flame 🔥 on this match!!! Word play is serious!!
Wash your hands, stay in and play "wasted on you"
Morgan wallen is stepping his game up. Scoot over luke combs!
Morgan Wallen, Luke Combs, and Upchurch are the best singers out there! Change my mind.
Mr. Wallen! Every time you sing anything, it’s fabulous!!!! All the songs are fantastic! I’m a retired grandmother of 8, who lives in Marshfield, Wisconsin. I love country music and you are wonderful! I’m so excited for you and your future in country music 😀. I’m looking forward to seeing you in concert but this Covid virus has delayed everything! Please take care of yourself and keep putting out these great songs!
Brazil 🇧🇷
Sending you love from India Morgan. Absolutely fire this song ❤️
♥️
Lord I love him ❤️ can’t wait to get my hands on his cd so I can jam all day long
I’ve had this on replay for an hour now
❤❤❤ love all his music
I'd pay him to sing this to my ex
Okay I'm back for another daily dose of this hit!
This is my FAVORITE song on the whole album!! September can't get here fast enough!!!!
This was my first intro song to Morgan and this absolutely beautiful.
Holy shit.... this a perfect representation of my last relationship....she went back to her abusive ex.... holy fuck this hits the feels
Like this version much more than the recorded. I’m not usually a stickler about songs being “over produced” but in this case, the production really does the song a disservice
The acoustic version is so much better, and his raw uncut version is better than that one. This song is my favorite and has been since he released it with just him and his guitar. FIRE🔥🔥🔥
Jeez he just said exactly what I feel rn 6 yr marriage down the drain
If you Listen to this song, then Memory I don’t mess with by Lee Brice and finally Chris Stapleton’s Starting Over....you will not be disappointed
YouTube recommended this for me. Me: thanks youtube....but who is this?
I could listen to this song all day long
https://youtu.be/lgNxwfbh_mk
This is FIRE ♥️♥️
Morgan should release an acoustic album.
This Rimes of me
Damn good song
Can we all just take a second to appreciate that beautiful bass that adds that ever present but often overlooked foundation to this kick ass song. If you listen closely that bass reverberates soooo deep
my favorite song from the album, killing it here
great album
So so so good. I really like the version on the album, but nothing comes close to this. Hits you in the feels all day and you can tell this was a personal one for him.
Favorite song !!!! Omgg❤️❗️❗️
I love it❤🔥🔥
It’s funny, I don’t like country music but I like this guys music😂
First time of hearing this song i heard it in an ad, very impressed i added it to music list! 😊
Man can you feel his words in this acoustic version!
I know it's kinda a weird thing, but Morgan has such an attractive nose
Gotta be famous to pull off a mullet that bad
I love this song
Okay I've come back to this everyday love this video and song I think hits close to home
Best voice 🙌
I have this song on repeat
Waiting and praying for the release of these sessions!
PURE FUCKING TALENT!! I DONT THINK THERE IS ONE SONG HE HAS SUNG THAT I DONT LIKE.
Amazing ✨
I love the acoustic version ❤ so much more stripped down
LOVE going to pick up the record today, have on youtube but still. Gotta support the sales ya know? My Record player deserves to play this.
Woow amo esto ♥️👄♥️✨
When I was 21 years old..ana
This guy is on it for real
Absolutely Legendary

Still up at 2am watching his new live songs . Definitely not wasted time though 😋
So beautiful ☺️ 👏🏽✨
All the songs he sings are on fire.  Especially love this one.  Car hop trays and amazon, stay safe friends.
This song instantly became my new favorite the second I heard it. Love it. So many amazing songs. Morgan Wallen always delivers 🔥🔥🔥
My mans mullet is on point. And don’t get me started on the songs.
I feel like every song I've heard him sing should be a radio single
Damn. That's a fine vocal duo
All of this time all of this money. All of these sorry’s I don’t owe you NOTIHNG! I know it says I don’t owe you honey. Super good song. It’s will be a monster hit!
❤️❤️❤️
This is song is my favorite 😍
I love it !!!!!!
I get the Garth Brooks Friends in low places vibe in the opening acoustics
I can not get enough of this song!!!
Wow... this was possibly my least favorite song on the album, but this version is so much better
If you don't love this song you don't know good music, this is so good! Song just hits!!!😍
Everyone is dropping sick music rn
He’s got money he needs to get that mole removed from his face hed be a lot better looking

I have this song on repeat. Nailed this one!
I don't always wake up in the mornin' Pour myself a strong one Aw, but when I get lonely I do Your memory gets burnin' Lean back on the bourbon Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you  Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again It's all my fault Yeah, I dropped the ball You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind Thinkin' 'bout all I've wasted on you  All of this time and all of this money All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew All them days I spent, wasted on you Wasted on you  Yeah, I swore this one'd be different My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet Looks like I'm learning the hard way again That's why I've been  Wasted on you All of this time, and all of this money And all these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent, wasted on you Wasted on you  Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back Right down to the flame of this match Wasted on you, wasted on you Wasted on you, wasted on you Wasted on you  All of this time, and all of this money And all these sorries I don't owe you, honey All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew All them days I spent, wasted on you, wasted on you Wasted on you, wasted on you Wasted on you, wasted on you
❤
Man, this song couldnt hit home anymore right now.  I live Right next to Rogersville so seeing a Local like you hit it big is so Badass. Congrats brotha, keep Killing It!!
So mullets really have returned...

This song triggered some painful past memories.  But also so beautiful!🖤🎶🎙
Acoustic of this is so much better
I SWEAR OUR SOULS  HAVE TRAVELED TOGETHER........EVERYTHING YOU SING HITS LIKE A BRICK..........BUT IM HAPPY AND GOOD ALONE JUST ME!!!!!!
This version of the song is way better than the album version. He needs to ditch the computer screeching noises on the official version.
🐐
Literally 99% won’t see this but I lost my job due to covid. They shut down all the restaurants in Cook county which then led me to loosing my apartment. I'm currently living out of my car which I try and make the best of. I've applied to a bunch of places I'm hoping to get a call back. if anyone could help me with whatever you could bc I'm needing stuff like hand warmers which I stuff my clothes at night when it's cold. Also cheap burgers/fastfood. I know times are tough for everyone these days but if you're able to help me I have paypal user name pay2winlife  If you're unable to help I totally understand  God bless you stay safe 🙏
Mere Xpression get the app

hi
This Covid-19 pandemic calls for global repentance from sin and neglecting of God; the Creator of the universe. Repent now and surrender your life to Jesus Christ.  Connect now to this prayer by Pastor Lazarus Muoka, General Overseer of the Lord’s Chosen Charismatic Revival Ministry, for Coronavirus disease healing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iap3Ynw-Ky4  He or She that commits sin is of the devil, I John 3:8 (I John 3:8). If you are into lying, cheating, bitterness, keeping malice, pride, manifesting anger, quarrelling, unforgiving, hatred, envy, contention, strife, bitterness, cursing, speaking evil of others, taking or giving bribe, selfishness, deception, kidnapping, smuggling, falsification of documents, swearing, extortion and other sinful character dispositions, you must repent (Colossians 3:5-9; Romans 1:29-32; Proverbs 6:16-19).  Such evil and wicked character will hinder the manifestation of God’s abundant blessings upon your life. If you are into lust, masturbation, fornication, adultery, prostitution (private or public), patronizing prostitutes, abortion, lesbianism, homosexuality, bestiality, watching pornography (I Corinthians 6:9-10), immoral thoughts or any act of immorality, you need to repent (Galatians 5:19-21; Mathew 5:28; Mark 7:21-23). Jesus loves you and wants to save you.

Are you into cultism, whether open or secret cult? Do you practice witchcraft or Yoga? Do you smoke cigarette or cannabis? Do you sell them or offer them to people? Do you smoke or sniff hard drugs such as cocaine, heroin, captain black, hashish or other banned drugs or snuff? Are you lusting - lusting after men or women, covetous, alcohol drinking (proverbs 31:4-6)? You must repent, stop them and give your life to Jesus Christ. Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.  Are you into marry and divorce? Then you are a sinner. Are you married to more than one person? Repent!! Marriage is between a man and a woman. Marriage is for better and for worse until death separates (Matthew 19:3-6). ‘Wherefore they are no more two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together let no man put asunder (separate)’. Cheating on your wife or husband is sin. Proverbs 28: 13 says, ‘‘He that covers his sins shall not prosper...You must repent of them, confess and forsake them (1 John 1:9).  Are you into worldliness? Don’t you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? (James 4:4; II John2:15-17). So, you must stop bleaching your body or painting your mouth, eyes, hands and legs or fixing attachments, weave-on, earrings (Genesis 35:2-4), bangles, chains and frying or perming your hair. Tattooing your body is satanic. Are you one of those that put on nude dresses, short skirts, transparent dresses to seduce men or women (a Seducer or a Promoter of lust is a Sinner – Mathew 5:28)   Perhaps you wear trousers as a woman? (Read Deuteronomy 22:5), that is an abomination (Revelation 21:8, 27). Therefore, make up your mind, repent and give your life to Jesus Christ. Are you spoilt? Jeremiah 4:30 says, ‘‘And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee. They will seek thy life’’. (2 Kings 9:30; Hosea 2:13; Exodus 33:1-6)  A Christian is not a Sinner and a Sinner is not a Christian (I John 3:9). If you must be a blessed child of God, then you must repent of your sins and give your life to Jesus Christ. If you believe Jesus Christ today, righteousness of God will come into your life and abundant life will be your portion (1 John 11-12). If you neglect this call to repentance and salvation and die, you will not escape fire of Hell (Hebrews 2:3). It is foolishness and sin to say or think that there is no God (Psalm 14:1; 9:17). Luke 13:3, Jesus said, ‘I tell you, Nay: but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish’. Cut off every besetting sin (Hebrew 12:1-2; Mark 9:43-48).   If you have decided now (2 Corinthians 6:2) to give your life to Jesus Christ and to forsake your sinful lifestyle, please say this prayer:  Almighty God, I come unto you in the name of Jesus. Father I confess that I am a sinner. All my sins I confess to you.  I am very sorry for all my sins (mention those you can remember). Lord I promise you that from today I will never continue in them anymore. I believe that Jesus Christ died and rose again on the third day for my justification.  Almighty God, use the blood of Jesus to wash my sins away. Lord Jesus, come into my heart, be my Lord and personal Saviour. I surrender my life to you. Cancel my name from the books of death and write it in the book of life. Give me power to sin no more. In Jesus name I pray. Amen!!

The French National Assembly started the revision of Bioethics law in September and October 2019, a scheduled course of action that is undertaken every seven years. Member of the province of Seine André Gattolin and Laurianne Rossi, published an article on the website of the Libération newspaper on October 2, titled, “France Must Pledge Against the Forced Harvesting of Organs.”  The article emphasized the lack of ethics law in the area of organ transplantation as an international business, which rarely known to the pubic, but highly profitable. It requested an addition to the Bioethics law to trace each organ transplant, to protect French patients as well as victims.   Article published on the website of Libération newspaper.  The article mentioned that organ pillaging has been a known, global phenomenon for a long time. It is mostly committed by criminal organizations and rogue groups in Brazil, India, and some east European countries. However, reports and investigations have proved there has been a government-sanctioned forced organ harvesting system in China for more than a decade.  The article cited a report from David Matas and David Kilgour, two Canadians, published in 2006, which claimed the majority of the victims of the forced organ harvesting are the thousands of prisoners of conscience, mostly Falun Gong practitioners, and imprisoned Tibetans and Uighurs.  The article also cited publicly available data from Chinese hospitals stating that there are more than 90,000 organ transplants annually in that nation, but the source of these organs are unknown, and the number of prisoners of conscience sentenced to death are covered up as a national secret.  The escalated persecution of Falun Gong, a well-known practice that can improve health, made a connection between a large supply of healthy organs and the large number of transplants.  Patients have to wait years for a matching organ in France, but it takes only a couple of weeks in China. This unexpected fast speed attracted many wealthy patients who were waiting for organs. The number of French citizens who traveled abroad to receive an organ transplant is increasing, as they appear as medical tourism destined to arrive in China hospitals.  Neurology doctor Alexis Genin of Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital in Paris, also a member of the organization Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH), said that some Chinese doctors betrayed the trust of the French medical system, whose best surgeons have trained the Chinese doctors during the past 20 years. He stated that it is unacceptable that the knowledge had been skewed so badly as to trade human organs on the market.  Many of the world’s countries have established laws to regulate the inhuman and unethical forced organ harvesting, including Spain, Israel, Italy, Norway, and Taiwan. Other countries, like Belgium, Britain, and Canada, have started discussions in their respective parliaments.  The United States, European Common Market, and Australia have already openly condemned the forced organ harvesting and organ trafficking.  In France, about 300 patients waiting for organ transplants disappear from the list every year. They didn't die, didn't receive an organ transplant, as least not in France, and their conditions are not worsening. So the question is, where did they go, and what happened to their illnesses? A method to answer this question is needed.  In the end, the article stated that France, as the initiator of International Declaration of Human Rights, must fight the ethic battle resolutely and exemplarily. Otherwise, France will become an accomplice of the hidden and uncontrolled organ transplant market. The DAFOH said that this is a crime of genocide, an invisible genocide.
You can hear the emotion and I love it!!!
Why am I not surprised this is another badass song?! LOVE IT!
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Amen. Repent and turn from sin! Obey God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out.
Morgan you are so Fire, i knew from day one! Happy to see your success
Awesome brother, love your music, daughter loves you.  From NE Tennessee, Bluff City.

Make a song with John Pardi please
I'll support any singer with a mullet. HELL YEAH BROTHER
I feel like Morgan Wallen is underrated!!! This men never writes a bad song! He truly is amazing
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🔺Non-Duality
This song is bad as hell...
How it should've been composed and not with a drum machine like the studio version.. it took away the rawness of the song...
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
Let’s go Morgan!!
the backup vocalist tho!!👌🏽👌🏽
Hope this version get put on ITunes. It really takes the song to another level.
Disappointed
Good Preacher on this Channel https://youtube.com/channel/UCCvDMlLteHpweVAcB5Ks3wg
why isn't this version on the album?! sooo good and hate to say but better than original.
I love warning too that’s a good one!
the new song with chris stapleton is way too good! made my dreams come true, 2 of my faves!!!
Is this Ted Cruz Jr?
You have so pretty intense marketing going on—your team must be working hard for you!
Maaaaaaan these songs sound so much better than the over produced poppy songs on the record. Dont get me wrong, I still love the record, but this is 100
Ulang ulang terus lagunya yang enak...i am replay back because easy hear
🥰🥰
I thought it was Ted Cruz in the thumbnail
You always nail it brother great job!! 👏🏻🇺🇸✊🏻 Anyone know what kind of microphone that is Morgan is using?
Classic song 🎤👏
His music never disappoints
Check our latest video we’ll appreciate it
Morgan can't even make a bad song. He writes everything into these songs. His sweat, pain, and sorrow! He is a legend!
https://youtu.be/rBnuZLsun1s
Thanks for pulling at my heart strings once again 🖤 never seize to amaze me with your talent!! Keep em comin Morgan
Hell yes. On point as always Morgan ❤
Whoever wrote this song did good. He doesn’t write his songs. Hope y’all know that.
This is unreal. Absolutely amazing

“That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved” - Romans 10:9❗️
Love your songs buddy
Thank you for not country rappin this. Could b on old school right next to randy Travis, George strait and Clint black. I'm so sick of young country.
To whomever is scrolling: sending you good vibes for the rest of the day or night. Thank you for reading!
THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION: Will you go to Heaven when you die? Have  you lied, stolen, used God’s name in vain, or lusted (which Jesus said  was adultery, Mt. 5:28)? If so, God sees you as a liar, thief,  blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins, you will  end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there’s good news. Though we  broke God’s Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: “God so  loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever  believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life” (Jn. 3:16).  Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds (it’s no  fairytale). He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior.  Please, today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and  grant you the gift of eternal life (Eph. 2:8,9). Then, to show your  gratitude, read the Bible daily and obey it, join a Christian church,  and be baptized. Visit NeedGod.com and LivingWaters.com.
Definitely needed this in my life 😭😍❤️
I would love an acoustic version of this song on Spotify, sounds much better
Damnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!
His songs are always the best! This is one of the songs that are stuck in my head
This shit is trash this is why country music is a bunch of whiny city boys
To me this song is different kind of song then im use to you singing,,but thats the way you challenge yourself.  At least I think it is.  Its very high notes to me but hey its ok. Youre a great singer.
this song gave me chills
🥺💖
i have no words for how amazing this album is!
Very Interesting'...
Bruh the 2160p really gets the mustache lookin great. Doesn’t help the sound quality though, but like he needs that
I’m not mr. right but I’ll £¥€£ you until he gets here.
Morgan Wallen is my favorite country singer. Luke Bryan, Morgan Wallen Luke Combs and more country singers.
I love Morgan Wallen
🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yall this song makes me so sad 😓 he speaks the truth
The 8 dislikes aren’t okay, this is the best thing in the world.
Another Hit!!! I'm so addicted to your Music 🎶🎶🎶🎶.
Voice of an angel 😇  literally heaven sent
0:50🤌🏼
THIS IS THE VERSION THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN ON THE ALBUM. Got this on heavy repeat and it hits home.
🔥 He's AH-MAZING! I can't put this song on pause! 😍🤩
All of this time all of this money all theses sorry's I don't owe you honey 🔥🔥🔥

Morgan, you probably won't see this, but damn man, your songs give me hope. I haven't heard a bad song yet. I listen to you everyday, and I hope you make music forever. You're officially my favorite artist.
One of my favs in the new album! Legit every song is FIRE!!! Morgan Wallen is one of the best country singers in history!! He's gonna win more awards this year!!!!
It’s such a weird thing that people watch live performances of performance that are prerecorded in professional studios lol. I want to see people perform a song to SEE if they can actually pull it off
I'm so happy they came out with this because the beat in the album version ruined the song
This song sounds wonderful in every way!
I get a feel of Garth Brooks in the guitar. love the song.
This is one bad ass song .and I don't even prefer country .
I don't particularly dislike country music, but I don't normally listen to it. However, Morgan is just something different.... Much love from Hong Kong!
Omg this is my anthem!!!! Tell'em for all of us Morgan!!! Preach it brutha!!!
When people find out he’s a Trump supporter. Dislike lmao 😂
10/10
The best song ever
To me this is a feel good song
IN LOVEEEE
I think most of us can agree we are either going through a breakup or just listening cause it’s Morgan Wallen... or both
The Post Malone of country music. Can’t make a bad song.
Wow🔥🔥
convinced you cant make bad song good job again morgan
I just found out about this guy a few minutes ago. Great song. I’m about to check out his music
I know this is about Morgan, but I gotta give it to that background singer too. He did the damn thing. This is my favorite song on the album
This is what I envisioned when I heard him sing this on Instagram the first time
Another hit I love this song
Can't imagine the improvement since the Voice
👌💕
I can’t 💀 I’m dead again. Just when I think he can’t get any better...BOOM 😭

Honestly one of my favorite artists. I cannot get over how talented this man is. He is God’s version of a Chef’s Kiss

👌🏾

Great tune
unpopular opinion but Morgan blows Luke combs away
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this stripped down version!!  “All the days I spent wasted on you” hits a nerve!  I’d listen to him sing the phone book. Morgan can’t do wrong. This album is incredible
So proud of you😭 from listening to the way I talk to this. You blowing up is the most amazing thing to see! God bless❤️
He hasn’t made a bad song yet🥰💕

I appreciate this stripped down version and honestly it takes the song to an entirely new dimension. Bravo!
im giving it to this.! Even better than the studio version.
Would have sounded better with a Martin... 😉 good stuff Morgan!
Literal fire.
Morgan will be talked about like Johnny Cash, ECT. I am Appalician and he's from Sweetwater. I'm in Wears Valley. One day he's going to be very famous.
This guy is unbelievably talented. I’m obsessed.
💗 And all the years you waste afterwards, thinking they'll come back... Promises are meant to be broken. Is love even a real thing anymore?!
PLEASE RELEASE THIS VERSION!!! 😍
Anyone else kinda hoping these songs aren't wrote from his past experiences?
Awesome performance. The emotions you show while singing this song make it that much better.
Morgannnnn! You are going to be competing with yourself for #1 spots and songs no doubt! All of these songs are golden Morgan "Midas" Wallen🌟💰🥇

MORGAN WALLEN (2021) – WASTED ON YOU (Traducción en español) I don’t always wake up in the mornin' No siempre que me despierto por la mañana Pour myself a strong one Me sirvo algo fuerte Aw, but when I get lonely I do Ay, pero cuando me siento solo lo hago Your memory gets burnin' Tu recuerdo quema Lean back on the bourbon Me apoyo de nuevo en el bourbon Sure as hell can’t keep leanin’ on you Bien seguro que no puedo seguir apoyándome en ti  Looks like I’m learnin' the hard way again Parece que estoy aprendiendo por las malas de nuevo It’s all my fault Es todo culpa mía Yeah, I dropped the ball Sí, metí la pata You’re gone and I’m gone three sheets to the wind Te has ido y estoy como una cuba Thinkin' ’bout all I’ve wasted on you Pensando en todo lo que he echado a perder contigo  All of this time and all of this money Todo este tiempo y todo este dinero All of the these sorries I don’t owe you honey Todas estas disculpas que no te debo cielo All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew Todas estas millas en este Chevy, y oraciones en un banco de iglesia All them days I spent, wasted on you Todos estos días que pasé, que he echado a perder contigo Wasted on you Echado a perder contigo  Yeah, I swore this one'd be different Sí, juré que esta vez sería diferente My heart wouldn’t listen to my head in these boots on my feet Mi corazón no escucharía a mi cabeza en estas botas que calzo Looks like I’m learning the hard way again Parece que estoy aprendiendo por las malas de nuevo That’s why I’ve been Por este motivo he estado  Wasted on you Echando a perder contigo All of this time, and all of this money and all these sorries I don’t owe you, honey Todo este tiempo y todo este dinero y todas estas disculpas que no te debo,cielo All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew Todas estas millas en este Chevy y oraciones en un banco de iglesia All them days I spent, wasted on you Todos estos días que pasé, que he echado a perder contigo Wasted on you Echado a perder contigo  Like this pile of your stuff that’s packed up in the back Como esta pila de tus cosas empaquetadas en la parte de atrás Right down to the flame of this match Directas a la llama de esta cerilla  Wasted on you, wasted on you Echado a perder contigo, echado a perder contigo Wasted on you, wasted on you Echado a perder contigo, echado a perder contigo Wasted on you Echado a perder contigo  All of this time, and all of this money and all these sorries I don’t owe you, honey Todo este tiempo y todo este dinero y todas estas disculpas que no te debo,cielo All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew Todas estas millas en este Chevy y oraciones en un banco de iglesia All them days I spent, wasted on you, wasted on you Todos estos días que pasé, echados a perder contigo, echados a perder contigo Wasted on you, wasted on you Echados a perder contigo, echados a perder contigo  Wasted on you, wasted on you Echados a perder contigo, echados a perder contigo

His songs are too good
My favorite on this album. Thank you we needed some good music

Dead and on repeat for the rest of the day!
Dont waste your time giving it to someone who doesn’t value it.
First couples chords made me want to sing, “Blame it all on my roots, I showed up in boots”
Forever a Morgan wallen fan

I've been trying to decide which one of his songs on his new album is best, but I can't! They're all so amazing and took so much talent and passion to create them. Good job Morgan!

This is 10x better then the studio version because it doesn't have that weird snap track playing in the back
Okay but what do I have to do to get lessons from his harmony guy?! He’s SO talented! 🔥

❤ hello fam If you are reading this, just wanted to remind you that God loves you and he has a wonderful plan for your life! 😁  God forbid If you died suddenly today, where do you think you would spend eternity??... If you are not sure, God wants to let you know that he loves you very much and that this is REAL LOVE — not that you loved God, but that he loved you FIRST by sending his Son Jesus to die for you to take away all of your sins that you would not perish but have everlasting LIFE!   Gods love for you cannot be measured, it has no boundaries and will look past all your faults. God saved me and set me free from a lifestyle of sin and addiction back a few years ago and my life has never been the same since. God can do the same for you if you allow him. Jesus is You have a choice, but just know that YOU ARE GODS CHOICE. And though the world may change, his love for you will NEVER CHANGE! God wants a RELATIONSHIP with you! Its not too late! He loves you!  The bible says in Romans 6:23 that the  wages of Sin is DEATH! But the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour!! Romans 10:9 & 13 says that WHO EVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF JESUS AND BELIEVES IN THEIR HEART AND CONFESSES WITH THEIR MOUTH THAT HE IS LORD SHALL BE SAVED!!  Im going to say a prayer for you! Lord bless my friend and their family with a long and healthy life. Lord I pray you make yourself real to them like you did for me in Jesus name. Friend, If you would like to receive Jesus in your heart or rededicate your life to him, then right where you are say this with me with your heart and lips outloud...  Dear Lord Jesus, come into my heart, forgive me of all my sins, wash me and cleanse me, set me free. I believe that Jesus died for me and that he is coming back again for me. Fill me with your Holy Spirit. Jesus make yourself real to me. I accept you today as my Lord and Saviour. I'm born again, all my sins are forgiven, I'm on my way to heaven because Jesus is in my heart!  Friend if you've said that prayer, I pray that from this day forward your life will never be the same. I tell you today that all your sins are forgiven, and always remeber dont run from God but run to him because God Loves You and has a plan for your life!  If you prayed with me, plz type amen! https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=900241527115892&id=100013901589755  God bless!😁     Don't believe in God??  Proof in the links!...👇  From crackhouse/drug dealer in Wash DC to Pastor! Depressed to the point of having a 40 cal to the head, TO  COMPLETELY SET FREE AND DELIVERED BY THE POWER OF GOD! Listen to this POWERFUL salvation testimony! https://youtu.be/XjTvi_wjZ9U People being filled with the Power of the Holy Spirit At Outreach Event: https://youtu.be/MKWzHeDNpqI In the streets: https://youtu.be/GWqbf7Qv7Kg  Life After Death. https://youtu.be/JYuY7Cm4KuQ https://youtu.be/GMAKSByShGU
