I think Ginge would be phenomenal in a GTA video. Maybe SDMN return to GTA6 with Ginge 🤷‍♂️
Wait…you’re someone else’s sloppy seconds of Talia!😮
My favourite quote this year: “Deji is Peak KSI”

Baldski ?
3:09 while everyone is distracted looking for the gesture, the editor just sneaked in "Baldski" there!
italy is 100% better than malta
Ginge and the Guys would be great in a "Task Master" style video.

Harry really making me doubt if I'm straight at 10:35
3:08 who else noticed that
"Y dijo Dios: Hagamos al hombre a nuestra imagen, conforme a nuestra semejanza; y señoree en los peces del mar, en las aves de los cielos, en las bestias, en toda la tierra, y en todo animal que se arrastra sobre la tierra. Así que creó Dios al hombre a su imagen, a imagen de Dios lo creó; varón y hembra los creó. (Génesis 1:26-27) 'La entrada de tus palabras alumbra; da entendimiento a los simples. (Salmo 119:130) 'Le provocaron a celos con dioses extraños, con abominaciones le provocaron a ira. Hicieron sacrificios a los demonios, no a Dios; a dioses que no conocían, a dioses nuevos que surgieron recientemente, a quienes vuestros padres no temieron. (Deuteronomio 32:16-17) 'Y recordarás que fuiste siervo en la tierra de Egipto, y que Jehová tu Dios te redimió. (Deuteronomio 15:15, primera mitad) 'Y salvarás al pueblo afligido; pero tus ojos están sobre los altivos, para abatirlos. (2 Samuel 22:28) 'El viento sopla de donde quiere, y oyes su sonido, pero no sabes de dónde viene ni adónde va; así es todo aquel que es nacido del Espíritu. (Juan 3:8) 'Oh, cuán grande es tu bondad, que has guardado para los que te temen; que has hecho para los que en ti confían antes que los hijos de los hombres. (Salmo 31:19) 'Quien (Jesucristo) fue entregado por nuestras transgresiones, y resucitó para nuestra justificación. (Romanos 4:25)  - KJV Google trans.-
Baldski on the hand 3:09 😂
Simon those feet genuinely made me gasp
"thtats tobi's job- wheres tobi?" so real
Definitely hopeful for sides to come to the U.S. eventually. Can’t really afford to fly to England just to try sides
0:00 funny how simon keeps point out how annoying he thinks it is of mr beast to do explotions fro no reason then he goes ahead and dose the same
The Patience test was one of the best videos i that house
the racist reincarnation was too funny 😂
Ginge 20v1
@Miniminter we want sides in India please😭😭😭😭
10:33 Harry with the eye contact🫠
20 vs 1 ginge edition??
Ahh loser i knew it
Harry in the sides video my LORDDDD🔥
Only one month left of 2023 dammn
You should do a sidemen hobbies channel! Where you just film your hobbies!
He is such a click bait king 😅
Did anyone see the baldiski on his hand ?😂
COOL EDITING
please bring sides to jonesboro arkansas I would work there in a heart beat
3:09 Baldski LMFAO
Dafaq was wifey or pricey
😕
The best time to have lesson in golf is now, as ur still a beginner, you wont have had enough time to get into bad habits that otherwise be hard to get out of if you had been playing for multiple years
Can we get a propper sidemen golf video with all the golfers in sidemen?
why would they bother having printed ones for themselves, ruins the fact its rare because its not. cause they never packed it, just got it printed directly
Don’t bend your legs when you’re putting. It throws you off. Just make sure you’re head is directly over the ball cause it gives you a more direct hit
£1000?
wow harry at the sides rizzing up the camera man , btw he is the most handsome of the sidmen. no gay sh*t just saying
Bring sides to South Florida PLEASE
A 6 on 400 yards hole is better than some people
Why was baldski on his hand?  3:08
so many mems in the OG sidemen house ❤
Angry ginge in a 20v1
Should play lethal company with ginge
Baldski on his hand?
damn it’s crazy i have a birdie before you xD!!! You’ll get one soon minister
“Angry Ginge is a G” but he sings about the type of people who use your charity and takes the piss out of them…
Great video love the content
He is the smartest dog! He saw 1 treat or 2 treats and went for the 2 😹😹
ginge 20 v 1
Bruh i clicked so fast just to be click baited
Bring back the  Mr & Mrs [Best couple] series Vs freya and josh Vs Ethan and faith Vs ellum and puffy  And Football Vids at the house
maybe the reddit vids should give you motivation to start doing more stuff and vlog it?
I can’t lie even these little clips with mushu and talia even make the video better even if u haven’t done anything crazy
"Where's the Bodeh" - Ginge 😂
8:19 wtf are you doing? 💀💀 its gotta be micro
THIS GUY KEEP CLIK BAIT SO ANNOYING UNSUBCRIBE!!!!

Does anybody know where can i get the same hoodie that Simon was wearing when he visited the old sidemen house?

The drawing of Ethan looks straight from meat canyon lol
Simon Have you tried football manager 24. There you can make a series about getting Leeds to become Europe's best team
Click bait 🖕
ginge 20v1?
10:35 harrys face 😍😍
15:05 acceleration
Your mother's clickbaiting poes
Minter, you gotta stop click baiting. Youre forever going to be known as KSIs friend, which is an achievement for sure, not one that youve worked on though
Ginge in 20 vs 1
If you guys keep posting Golf on moresidemen you won’t ever reach 10M
Ok Simon the clickbait is getting annoying now you lanky millionaire sex offender
9:43 how are you ment to rang wh3n all of us dont know or can confirm or deny ranking when JJ hasent exposed his womans face.... ever?
Who else saw the baldski on Simon's hand?
Once again, did not fall for this clickbait.
Baldski?
6:17
Who won the $1,000?

Sidemen living in the old sidemen house for a week video

19:43 December CPM
3:08  Why does Simon's hand say "baldski" lmao
20v1 ft angry ginge🤩
Amazing video 🥹🥹
I think for the next Sidemen Sunday they will do 20vs1 with Ginge or could be next Sunday
Ginge the Tragedy Chanter
Am I the only one who noticed the Baldski on Simon’s palm at 3:09
Simon, I'm from Malta and I love your videos!
The guy that did the drawings made em all look Acoustic
subtle flex baldski
We need all sidemen back in this house, I loved JJ's old setup, new one just doesn't give the OG vibe. That's where he reacted to his songs, reddit, and general videos. And same goes for you, this looks better.
Editor needs a raise
Mushu is so cute
Ofc Simon likes Ksimon card 😂❤
Went down on her before her wedding! (Click bate)
Im sorry but I laughed for 30 minutes after seeing those drawings
If you truly want to play golf and this goes for anyone, it is so crucial to start with a decent coach, once you get bad habits into your game it can take so much time and effort to correct them
2:45 i think i heard him saying the N WORD am i the only one ?
Simon the MASTERBAITER
Will sides come to America?
Ginge is fckn jokes I agree what a true g
When are you gonna open some sides stores in scotland? I need to try this food
The 50 cent gig looked 🔥 af lit ep
Open a sides store  in Sydney
Listen, I don't care about any other prediction but Mushus. Keep doing them for as long as this fight game is a thing. lmao
Talia is the new Cruella De Ville🤣🤣🤣
another cheap vs expensive football match vid with ginge would be cool
Yo simon stop playin with our emotions dude
if there is a troops channel for golf it needs to be just golf, no challenges, just a days game. i think it'll pop off especially with stans of sidemen
The  random baldski edit at 3:09 xD why? lol
WE GOT SIMONS FEET BEFORE GTA6
Baldski at 3:10
MAIN CHANNEL FOOTY?? REALLY???
17 on trending?!  10:34 whew 11:24 king 13:28 literally Josh
i had bruised fingernails and they fell off. so be careful
Ethan holding box is crazy☠️☠️
These vlog reddit videos are such high tier content. Please upload more! 🙏
Baldski
the nostalgia of the old house man that brought back some many memories. Fave one was the helium try not to laugh!
Simon looks extra good on his golf hat
Simon is probably the only YouTuber that can clickbait, And not have me loosing my sh*t.
baldski in his hands lol
Simon you can’t be out here giving out the feet for free 😂
Angry ginge in a sidemen patience test?
Love this editting style you have adapted, it shows you really do listen to the viewers and read the comments <3 Love ya big man
Bruv you packing your own rare cards takes them away from your fans
Ginge is a real one 😂
9:07 lovee this kind of reddit addition
Can you do a sidecards opening with Talia? Think that would be pretty cool
A casual golf channel would be great
We need sides in NZ
honestly, big ups to vikkstar though, thats goals for myself one day, to basically be able to drop 100k and not even be that stressed about the money besides event planning obviously
Yo SImon's got them alien/big foot hybrid feet. what are those?
Do a prediction challenge with Mushu and your family dog
13:28 BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
WHY AM I BLACK?
Baldski is back 😂
Whats the text on simons forhead at 0.54
denies he does it and then continue to do it again with "baldski" written on it 3:09
NAAAAAH YOUR FEET ARE GETTING CLIPPED AND GETTING INTO THE NEXT REDIT VIDEO

I was thinking 20women vs angry ginge
I hope Simon gets new wife 😂
i say angry ginge 20vs1
I'm surprised none of the sidemen houses have been turned into a hotel/air BnB
3:12 for a Suprise 😂
20 v 1 with ginge
Here is your crown the clickbater 👑
I mean...it's not really a clickbait
Ankles got sent with that thumbnail
An actual dislike for that clickbait Don't play with my feelings
Stop giving me false hopes
luv the format, also this was plenty for the month and throwing in extra stuff at end is good
I personally think you should get a sides restaurant in Newcastle
3:09 Did anyone else see what was written on his hand
20vs1 with ging
If you want ginge to be himself in a video then there can only be one........ 20 V 1
Get well soon right big toe
It's insane to see the house after so many years, I started following the sidemen bcos of vikk's tour of that house 😭
Mommy arrons gets it
clickbait king is back
I love these Hause ❤️💔💔old sidmen
for the troops golf channel, honestly keep it low production. i think the main point is just for us to see your guys' personality on the golf course.  maybe just have 1 camera person? it'll probably be more casual than having too many camera people following you around
Does the UK prime taste different than the US prime?
It the bit when he had baldski on his hand at 3:10
Baldski lol
North Downs GC?
13:45 wait what video is this picture from
At 13:28 Y DOES MUSHU LOOK SO HUMAN EWWWW
13:28 Joshu
“They are using that room for something else” definitely got a grow on to pay the rent for that place 😂
U should do a hide and seek in the old sdmn house
When will sides come to York
I need to know if the sidemen are ever going to come to the merry hill sides restaurant???
Miss those vibes
10:35 Jesus Christ, Harry. Don’t do it to em
6:02
the drawings had me dead lololololololololol, they were really good!
A troops golf channel would be soooo cool. I think it would bang and you wouldn't have to post too much
so there not doing a hide and seek in the old sidemen house?
Whoaaa that clickbait
do ginge vs 20 women be funny
Any1 see the baldski
MAKE NEW SIDEMEN HOUSE PLSSSSZZZZ
Why did he randomly have Baldski written on his hand ✋️ 3:10
the josh's face edit on mushu was so random🤣🤣
Petition to bring back Talia Tuesday😢
Thanks Simon for answering my question about Dave!
Why did he not want to say Gib’s name? 🤨
Simon at 14:40 you could have said Although my Favourite is You(Talia) and that would have been so wholesome and sweet but you are just dumb
17:50 i need to know why miniminter is seeing Cox live 😭🤣
AngryGinge 20v1???

Talia needs to chill with that toe sucking, my man Si is in the pits. He's up against a pitbull in bed  💀

Josh's face in Mushu is nightmare fuel.
03:09 that "baldski" on the hand lmao

Agreed to keep the format of your vlogs/reddit. Something  different than just a reddit review.
im loving the vlog footage in reddits
Ginge 20v1?

The sidemen cards are a lot of money.

clickbait god
You could add bts footage of sidemen shoots for vlog footage if you aren’t doing other things
This man always clickbaits me and i don't mind it 😂
Italy is a better place than England Simon, no need to cry but ur country is a big hole
50 cent had about 50 thousand people and Talia had about 15 people 😂😂😂

SIDEMEN HIDE N SEEK IN THE OLD SIDEMEN HOUSE
Baldski
Ginge 20v1
Early 💜
Josh face on Moushow got me of gard 😹
Ginge 20 vs 1?
There should be a drinking game for alcoholics where if the video is not clickbait, they can drink that day
you should do a angry ginge 20 vs 1
the king of clickbait gets me 95% of the time on both channels
Damn that resturant looks nice af.  Its crazy to see the start of what will be a billion dollar company.
why was there a random baldski on you hand broski lolz
yes make a new sidemen house plsss 😄
20 vs 1 Angry Ginge edition  👇🏻
baldski?
good stuff
Mushu with Josh's face is terrifying
Ayyy simon22 is back
1:22 1:28
WE NEED A NEW SIDEMEN HOUSE. but the sidemen are not in there prime sadly but. i thing 1 more intill sidemen stops
Mom said its my turn to be pinned
mate I want to see more home vlogs
I really dont understand sidemen's obsession with golf i find it extremely boring and also not very eco-friendly due to woods being cut down.
Nice 👍
id love the golf channel
Who was your best man in your wedding?
Sidemen collab with four brothers on the golf course
What happened to Talia Tuesdays??
Mushu is soo goofy cute idk
8:36 Man smoked some good zaza
You love Ginge, just a shame he hates poor people...
no $1000 dollars?
not baldski on his palm😭
I don't understand the card opening - they are taking limited edition signed cards off the market. That means that actual people, paying money, have a 1/200 chance to get a card instead of 1/100, for example.
3:09 Look at his hand😂
get ginge in a holiday video!!!!!
15:05 "whooooooooaaaaatttt???!!!"
The new golf love from y’all could be a fun start to a new charity event, charity golf matches
Where are the videos simon said they filmes at the old house??
Definitely did a hide and seek in the sidemen house
The history in the old sidemen house
We need a golf vid pleaase!
troops golf yes. just video y'all playing and some jokes every now and then
Dislike
I've been cluck baited
We need all of the sidemen back in that house so many memories 😂
we need a hide & seek in the SDMN house!!
So the moresidemen vids r actually in the old house...thought it was a greenscreen

the fact the sidemen member spend more than 100,000 grand on their weddings just shows how much money they have and that they love there wifes
great definition of Talia at 14:16 on her top 'Ragged'... nice I wish I could Rag it
Ginge 20 v 1 please
