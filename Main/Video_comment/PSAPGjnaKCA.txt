"ONLY ONE OF US GON' MAKE IT OUT ALIVE AND IT'S NOT YOU!!!" me in dodgeball
I've been waiting patiently I built this tower quietly And when my well of Wellbutrin Is running dry of serotonin I can say things I don't mean Or maybe it's the truth in me I feel it building, bubbling up My t-t-time is up  I'm so misunderstood, but I live for this My money's good and I came to win So step on up, and I promise you Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat) only one of us Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat) only one of us Only one of us gon' make it out alive  I've been making my Gethsemane Since I was young, my ancestry (cutthroat) Was marching martyrdom across the Radadadadumbla plains of Utah (cutthroat) I can't lie, I've been played By powerful people who get their way But I, in time, will climb my mountain I, in time, will rise  I'm so misunderstood, but I live for this My money's good and I came to win So step on up, and I promise you Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat) only one of us Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat) only one of us Only one of us gon' make it out alive  Try me!  Try me!  Cutthroat! Only one of us Only one of us, not you (cutthroat) Only one of us, only one of us Only one of us  Get on the knee, get on the knee Get on the knee, get on the knee Get on the knee, get on the knee Get on the knee, get on the knee Cutthroat (get on the knee) Cutthroat (get on the knee) (Get-get-get) cutthroat (get-get-get) (Get-get-get-get-get-get) cutthroat
While not a classic glam song I feel like Cutthroat is more of a glam song than anything Imagine Dragons have ever put out. The lyrics also have a good amount of meaning behind them unlike the rest of Imagine Dragons output. 0:09 - 0:32 Can be easily interpreted as him talking about his career, also Wellbutrin is a discontinued drug made to treat depression. 0:21 Can also be interpreted as starting drama for attention like how many famous people thrive off of rumors. 1:01 Gethsemane means "Oil press" but is more probably talking about the Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus was arrested, but also frequented, this lyric can be interpreted in a few ways, but I personally believe that the interpreted as: He is building the place where he is going to fall from a young age. After this the lyrics are pretty simple but stable metaphors.  PS: I really like small voice tick at 0:29 to symbolize a clock ticking.
I loved the heart beating, it made me think of this mornings mountain climb and running at the end to the top. I started out slow and kept speeding it up one notch a minute, in the last minute of the 30 minutes I kicked it up to like 4.5mph and sprinted to the top. My pulse rate jumped from 175-190 real fast and thats a dangerous level. So you might be right on that. 🤔 Speaking of Mr. Dragon Talent can you do a slow rhythm steadily climbing from 1mph to 4.5mph? That would be bad ass to put on headphones and rock out mountain climb. 😘✌️
My friend used this song as her cancer fight song!!!

Gonna blast this on my way to the next trial💪💪

til imagine dragons can make bad songs
♡I love this song♡

hbggc
had some hopes that Imagine Dragons was gonna go metal after this. I was wrong.
It’s a song to the demons that don’t want to leave god said what up 🎉
💋👻💋👻🤘
This sounds like it could belong in a Hunger Games soundtrack
Death from puss in boots
This is the worst thing I've ever heard lmao

Awesome
The only thing That annoys me in this clip is the Cockroach due to phobia
It’s giving hunger games vibes

One of the best song by them
really real~~~ly like this song ☆
Weird music type but still didn't stuck in my head
mode evil in the end drop
Wow! Not even a dislike at all comm. Gooooood :)
Mental illness theme song! Few can put the feelings of the broken into musical representation that they themselves can't convey. some powerful stuff!  👏 +good day playlist
At parts, it sounds like a Kendrick Lamar type beat crossed with System of a Down vibes. Unexpected, but loving it!
This is perfect for a battle Royale Trailer or a Hyper-Realistic shooter  Trailer
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯🙏🏽🤟🏽
I am so addicted to this song 🥵🥵
Ya estoy acostumbrada a esta canción y la he escuchado decenas de veces, pero esta es la primera vez que me da literalmente escalofríos
could you just imagine this being a theme song for a top heel in wrestling?
When this victory occurs, I'm immediately going to seek to fix things and won't be "triggered annoyed" nor in "dancing glee" (neither emotion extreme). I'm going to be kind of like a robot and fix things, pretty damn quick. Meanwhile, I'm pushing as much Open Source computer knowledge (like wikibooks and MAN pages) as I can mention to people _(even though I also think proprietary software and compulting can be cool)._ Well, that and prepping _(like first-aid-biology/DIY and water and theoretical G-O-O-D bags lists)_ is what I'm encouraging meanwhile _(before this kicks off)._ Tell all your mates to do that sort of knowledge quest. Just a few web-browser bookmarks here and there for casual reading can do it. Keeps things thrifty and is prepping, so it should help people hit the ground running when this occurs. I reckon it will help people. I've donated money to GNOME-Foundation (linux GTK4) and maybe others will mirror that a little bit here and there _(or maybe they'll choose the Linux Foundation, etc.)._ My comment has no hate in it and I do no harm. I am not appalled or afraid, boasting or envying or complaining... Just saying. Psalms23: Giving thanks and praise to the Lord and peace and love. Also, I'd say Matthew6.
It's like the "Death on Two Legs" of Imagine Dragons. Bravo!
This song is special.. it’s like you talking to you, the dark and the light side inside us all.. But also it’s like a message to the big musical industry, they won’t take control over the I.D. band🫶
that was bloody violent
This song reminds me of the horror comedy “Spree”
que hino
This song makes me wanna tell the waitress it was the wrong order
Scary😱 😍
Playing solo battle Royale be like:
I've never been more angry than when I ordered a t-shirt with Imagine Dragons and the picture looked like shit. I was like: 0:40
So violent too
Awful song omg
Me at auctions
This song feels illegal to listen
Dan. U ok. It kinda sounds like you have a frog in your throat
Dan. I ok
It feels like a musical number of a crime fiction play where the trusted friend of the protagonist betrayed them.
I first hear: An inner struggle between who we really are and our inner critic...... who will win? But he's speaking truth to Religion, Inc.  That would be epic to see  $$Religion, Inc$$ die because we are speaking truth to power and will not negotiate.  That's a funeral I'd attend.  What if we worshipped THIS life and each others' lives? Why would that bother an almighty God if we ignored him/her/it to be radically present...no need to worry about anything else. So much we can do now to make life better for all. Isn't meditation about the present? ✌🌏🌎🌍☀️⭐
Das geilste was es zur Zeit auf dem Markt gibt  Jeder Song ein Treffer 👍 Einfach Hammer 🔨 ich liebe diese Jungs ❤️
As a quiet kid i could easilly put this song loudly while walking at school

Now that's my favourite song

Anyone else here from nhl 22?
I love this song because it actually feels like whether a Cutthroat was singing it to you.   It's perturbing, creepy, and makes you have goosebumps.
The Mormon church is coming to an end. People are waking up to the truth.
Pretty good, though it doesn't really have that imagine dragons spark to it, has rather big "dont come to school tomorrow " energy
Wow this song sucks 😂
Damnnnnn, I really love it when they go rock. Reminds me of the Night Visions era
this makes me feel high, Big Bad Boy, and edgy, and it's fukin amazing
Some of the sounds sound like the noise that some headphones or speakers make when they are low on battery and die
Pff
Happy anniversary Cutthroat..
2:00 that toy in the kids section
I very very very love your song. I'm Michaela 10 years old. I'm Chech republik
That singing though!

This is the best song on nhl 22
This video this version 👎 i like so much the other video and other version ❤
Who's here from NHL 22?
The way dude screams 'TRRRRYYYYYYYY MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY' gives me shivers everytime.
Yes and No. Dont mess with a ouiji board in any way shape or form

Only one make us  gonna make it out alive and it's not you..... ✌️🤙try me...🥁
*head banging*
this song is a drug, i need it and i cant stop listening to
The certified sequel to Natural.
When you are really angry but instead you go here listening  Screamin' like "only one of us can make it out alive and it's not you"
Good old doomsday clock
The song is crazy and murky...   But always great 🤩
This song looks like an American horror story intro
Trump thinks HE is above the KING of JEWS and had “pardoned” 18 many times over Child molesters that “sit” in Congress. They are to be castrated or casturated correct spelling and change to alter meaning to some else- neutered chemically is what the first spelling means.
Holy shhhot Is this...the most savage song of Imagine Dragons?
1:59 esse efeito é tão gostoso de ouvir 😫

Une chanson à mettre à fond avec son casque ^^
This song means so much to me cause it woke up my grandpa from a 7 week long coma just so he could turn this crap off. Lol
I only listen to this while I’m pissed off and I’m literally going insane
essa banda merece a fama ela e MUITO BOA
Sounds like my new favorite spiritual warfare song.
How I love magic dragons, one of my favorite songs, I've been listening to you for 8 years
https://youtu.be/F1qR72JDbYQ
🖤🔥
Well. This is a different type of Imagine Dragons song lol.
For me , it sounds good but the solo part broke it ... i just dont like those types of parts  ... rest is great
it's so embarrassing that this made it through so many levels of production and no one bothered to them it sounds like shit
its like were in a war.. i wonder why this gives me betrayal vibes..
so fire man
🖤🤍❤
Bro.... SQUID GAMES!
I love imagine dragons ♥️♥️♥️
NHL 22
Holy shit this is good
It's really cool! My goodness!
This is another legend...
This is my personal hockey pump-up since it's basically about my life and also my decision to play hockey.
The "try me" at 2:04 fuckin' gets me every time... damn
Why are so many people trippin out about this song? This song is 🔥 and gets my blood pumping! This whole album is so good, but this song is one of the best. So fun to play this song while playing a fear-inducing game; instant courage for almost a whole 3 minutes!
Best comment section on youtube. No hate, no bulshit, no toxic kids. All chill. All relaxed.  All supportive. All positive. Mid stressed exam session, this is what everyone needs. Enjoy every minute of your life, it is Amazing.
My opinion this is the only song I dislike in this new album
look if u dislike this try hearing it witha good headphone instead of just speaker, so u can listen to every element & note clearly and realize that it's actually a bop
Dude just needs to let more of this out... less polish is good to.. show the human element
I swear I hear some inspiration from #nineinchnails
⛅🙏🏻🤍💛💓
OMG!  This is so bad...
Does anyone think it sounds similar to Nine Inch Nails?
I heard a "critic" talking down on this song because of how chaotic it is. But the reason I like the song it's because how chaotic it is.
Favorite song on the album!
You know it's interesting the different tastes in music everyone has. Reading the comments, I didn't think this many people would like this song, since upon first listen it wasn't good, and on many subsequent listens, this song has only gotten worse in my opinion. I can confidently say this song is down there with Digital and Dancing in the Dark as the worst imagine dragons songs that they've ever made. The instrumental and vocals in the verses aren't bad, but the moment the pre chorus and chorus kick in, Dan's voice goes from being nice and mysterious sounding to loud and scream-like with no instrumentation that would back up that kind of vocal performance.
My first listen to this was in the car with my mom, and the two of us were completely taken aback. I mean, wow! I really wasn’t a fan, but the more I listen, the more I LOVE this song; it’s SOO good. I’ve been having so much fun listening to the entire “Mercury - Act One” album and hearing the new sounds that these guys are creating
New favourite song check
BSB style, I love it ♥️ Especially how they simulate their music as well so powerful 🔥
Me waiting for a bomb anime to use this....as a fighting seen  music

Crush: Is there someone who can drive me home?  Me: TTTTTTRRRRRRTYYYYYY MMMMMMMMEEEEEEE.
I’d like to put a link to this and have this as a teaser song to one of my wattpad stories.  Imagine a giant carnivorous worm popping out of the ground to a helicopter when you hear the words TRY ME  THAT THERE IS THE TEASER FOR MY STORY SUBTERRANEAN!
stronk song
When I first listened to it: Eh. Later at 2am:                 **Goes back to song and puts it on loop**
this is part of coming album mercury
This belongs in an intro to a murder movie
Playing Red Dead Redemption 2 with a knife:

This give me the band In This Moment vibes
video games... action movies... sport games... watch the space this song  is going to dominate
I just imagine Connor McGregor's strut in the octagon to this song
This is absolutely awful
I just realized this song describes Death Note a lot. When he says "Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you," It reminds me of what will happen if Light or L reveals his identity. One of them will die. L will get his name written down while Light will get sentenced to death. Honestly, I think this is more from Light's POV because he is challenging L. After all, the song says "Try me." He knows that he'll prevail and L will die.   (Spoiler) L does die.
Masterpiece🔥
Imagine listening this while a fight with bullies at school
Why is this song so relatable on how mad someone is
Am I the only on feeling evil after listening to this

This song is like me to my inner demon, my social anxiety, shyness... Very powerful and motivating
This song is THE BEST! 😍🔥
This song is fire 😳 thank you Imagine Dragons 👍🏻
THESE VOCALS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
2:07 when I step on a lego
My grand parents told to my parents about the Beatels, then my parents told me about Quinn and now I'm gonna tell to my children about Imagine Dragons
as someone who knows imagine dragons for 'demons' 'radioactive' 'thunder' and 'believer', this is very different than what i've heard from them.
This is good for my ideal animation with my specific characters ngl
He can sing for a metal band..

i think this is a remix of cradles😂😂😂
Such a powerful song ❤️ I get goosebumps every time I listen and dedicate this to my demons.
I've been waiting patiently I built this tower quietly And when my well of Wellbutrin Is running dry of serotonin I can say things I don't mean Or maybe it's the truth in me I feel it building, bubbling up My time is up I'm so misunderstood, but I live for this My money's good and I came to win So step on up, and I promise you Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat) Only one of us Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat) Only one of us Only one of us gon' make it out alive I've been making my Gethsemane Since I was young, my ancestry (cutthroat) Was marching martyrdom across the Radadadadumbla plains of Utah (cutthroat) I can't lie, I've been played By powerful people who get their way But I, in time, will climb my mountain I, in time, will rise I'm so misunderstood, but I live for this My money's good and I came to win So step on up, and I promise you Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat) Only one of us Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat) Only one of us Only one of us gon' make it out alive Try me! Try me! Cutthroat! Only one of us Only one of us, not you (cutthroat) Only one of us, only one of us Only one of us Get on the knee, get on the knee Get on the knee, get on the knee Get on the knee, get on the knee Get on the knee, get on the knee Cutthroat (get on the knee) Cutthroat (get on the knee) (Get-get-get, get-get-get) Cutthroat (Get-get-get-get-get-get) Cutthroat
Worst song I ever heard in my 28 years of existence 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Anyone else getting Hamilton vibes?
:D THE BEST MUSIC 2021
😍😱
Quien en 2021 ecuchandola 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Energetic song😈😈😈
So good
Kind of reminds me of some of nine inch nails stuff
I wonder what the context behind this song was...
Que lindo
Amazing masterpiece by the dragons.
Pls check out my playlist it's fire🔥🔥☺
How does he kill it every time
Vous êtes les meilleurs imagine dragons
I wanna hear this in Lucifer last season
No paro de escucharla, están buena 🖤🖤
Why does it start like a DOOM music tho
If you like this song check out the cover I made (;
Remember me, as I will soon be forgotten in the world of comments ;-; ...
Ohhhh Mannnn!! it's INTENSE
My opinion their worst song
Trash-talkers be like:
Muy diferente a Follow you, la cual me encantó en el mismo momento que la escuché, y está aún no la entiendo 😅
This song is about getting rid of that part you don't like about you
Sounds like Natural but way worse. Why does all new music from my bands sound like a gimmick?
we need another album
TECHNO NEVER DIES!
my life in a nutshell equals this
Why is this giving me Nessa Barrett vibes
Esta muy bien la canción cinco estrellas UwU
Where is tech9 at
0:10 halo infinite
Just found this band and loved it thanks to 420
"Try ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  Cowardly wimps only lie........... Do Something...Anything ;D
I'm interested to see if there will be an acoustic version of this song.
I Will go to remix this Using  Pig death metal voice only on some parts of the track  i think needs 😂❤️
Temazooooooo
"TRY ME" *goosebumps everywhere*
This is one of those songs that you don't immediately enjoy, sort of like FOB's Young and Menace, but you eventually end up absolutely addicted to.
Good song of Imagine Dragons the screams style Metal Alternative AWESOME!!!.
Joss joss!!ফাটাচ্ছ মাম্মা।
0:41 That’s Jesus
It's a battle with yourself. When the medication runs out, the fight is still on. You got this.
It could have been a great Harvey Spectre soundtrack
заебись
Nosé que expresar o sentir solo es como un silencio absoluto mí memente
O my god. I am mad on it
is ma,king a youtube channel free?
Here’s a film about Cutthroat: https://youtu.be/Cp0MGOl-BQE Seems perfect.
This is my new theme song
I’m 😃 scared ✨
For real tho this song is really intimidating like- when he said “try me”
You know those songs you wish you could Like multiple times? Well, that's this song.
If there was ever an amphibia MV, the only character I could see this song fit is Sasha. Heck! Only one of the three girls will make it out alive! Edit: I hope the season finale comes out soon, because I really want to watch it.
At this point you could just fire the guitarist seeing as you know no use for him
feels like this song can fit for borderlands game song
I JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW MANY ADRENALINE SHOTS DID HAVE IN TO MAKE THIS SONG
I want by cutthroat qwp plz not kill me
This makes me think of Hamilton. I am unsure why, but I do not consider it a bad thing
its good too!!!
its a good song... try the believer everyone!
I love this song! I cant get over how different it is!
Wait wait wait, i just hear cutthroat in the song natural.
Fighting in Mortal Kombat be like:
If nature had a soundtrack it would be this
This song should be the Finals Game Anthem..!!
Thanks Imagine Dragons, keep on making weird shit like this. No more generic EDM Pop please, thank you - A faithful fan
them: wow I guess motivational music works  me: ONLY ONE OF US WILL MAKE OUT AND ITS NOT YOU!
Please make more masterpieces like this one!
wtf so good
Hmm, I wonder if there will be a clip? It would be interesting to see it
This is Lit
"TRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
Wow you know what hey mabye it is just either the sound of the singer who is the problem not the drummer or Bass player or guitar player and I say this as in like towards the end of this song the pure rock sound of drumms not the pop rock drumms sound came in and sounded good so hmm who's holding this band band is it the singer or is it the record label there on or is it the fact that they just wanna be relevant so they make crap mainstream rock music that could be put on the basic raido. Or is it the singer that tells the whole band that it needs to be relevant and that they need to be all mainstream and be on basic raido so they do pop rock not pure rock like they should be doing. Like idk anymore with this band like anything one of these things I just said in this  comment could be true at this point and we just don't know witch one and I'm really curious and want to know what it is.
Wow
🤤
This is... unique
i've been listening to this song since it came out and i just realized he says "'get on the knee"' at the always thought its some random sounds XD
This song is very angry!
I Wana make this a meme
This can be banger for gangsters/criminals series intro
Sheeeshhhhhhh Danny boy
1:56 Epic Moment
I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. (Luke 13:5) Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. (Isaiah 55:7) When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. (Mark 2:17)
Eran jeager scream from attack on titan❤️ 1:57
Devil....enemy , God's army of 1 will win , you won't!!!!!🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸
I did not expect this, but holy crap I am impressed. And the fact that this and "follow you" are on the same single really makes me excited! I just hope that this was some sort of a teaser for a new album, I can´t wait for a new release!
this song is like gonna be played in hell  when they are getting ready to fight the angels :P
Master piece  baby😍😍😍😍☠
My fight song
Al
Jeez he sounds different
This song makes me feel I shouldn't have been born...
MY IDOLS HAVE RETURNED AND I'M MORE THAN HAPPY!  I love you, guys.
People will say this song is hella scary af , but I found it a motivational song. TRY MEEE!
This song plays when you disrespect  yo parents
I want to hear this as BGM in John Wick 3
Dude I was not expecting this they usually make beautiful, sad songs but dude this song is COOL
Another music for AOT tiktok
I need a music video for this too :(
❤
Not You !!
Usually I like there songs but this song is still good just a little angry
This is why imagine dragons is better than Maroon 5. They actually experiment on different styles of music and they make risks that it won’t be in the mainstream unlike Maroon 5. Old maroon 5 was better
SUPER SONG
Everything nice but they have the same problem they had with follow you They have melodies for voice and beat BUT where is melody made something different than vocal?
*me listening to this* Dan's trying to do a light screamo now??
Bro, your bishop is gonna suspend your temple recommend for this one.
Elder Reynolds thinks he's Trent Reznor now? lol.
the band went thru a soft boi phase but got bullied and started their villian arc early
Explains the struggle of Wellbutrin and thank GOD im OFF it!!!! A good song of expression of the hell you go through and than claiming VICTORY of SELF not med.....HECK YEAH, THANK YOU!!! 💪❤💪
saying this now this is going to be viral just wait
I feel like the minute he started taking his top off his career went downhill
Honestly one of their best songs yet
Me puse a escuchar esta canción como por milésima vez y me dieron ganas de abrir los comentarios y wooooow, me enorgullece que tantos latinos escuchemos música tan buena :3
Imagine Dan singing this song in a live concert!! Woowww  Just want to see how he will act
Teacher to quite kid : say a sentence Quite kid : only one of us can make it out alive and it's not you Whole class 😱😱😱😱
This song is grade A flaming garbage. The singing is downright terrible, massive cringe every time he does the chorus. This screechy talk singing rap rock butchery is nothing like his other melodic songs. Leave the rock screaming to David Grohl and have Shinedown cover this song as it would be 100x better.
Remember when they use make songs like tiptoe, amsterdam, hear me & top of the world? I used to be a huge fan but now they just keep making a radioactive type song which is annoying. I really miss their alternative side. This is pure mainstream pop.
Ares' Song
Cringe
1:56
The best😘
WOW
Listen in 1X25
Remind me Nine inch nails "the warning" ❤️love it!!
This is surprisingly good
is it just me or does it sound like a kazoo playing starting at 1:59?
3,2,1 Sing MMA
My brain : your just like a  vampire biting the things  My hands: SLap SlaP slap!!! my legs : your stupid millionaire  Me: Your are the people said and i promise you
sounds like Kendrick Lamar - HUMBLE.
it's like a dog barking
Anybody here listen to this song while holding their neck?
I like this and what ever it takes
obviously the mv is kinda creepy
Crows represent death so good choice in the pictures
Far and away the worst one.
The best  band in the world
People say bts and kpop I say imagine dragons forever ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ who's with me 👇
This where perfect for peaking fockin blinders
1st listen: It kinda sucks 2nd listen: Honestly its not bad 3rd listen: I love this song! 4th listen: CUT MY THROAT AND LET ME IN!!
The beat is amazing tho
is Dan's throat ok?
one off the best

Love this. Reminds me of a cross between a few different genres. since I listen to everything from EDM, to heavy metal, I love all music and this seems like a hybrid between all the genres, bravo 👏👏👏👏 Also coming from a history of mental illnesses it really resonates with me.
Buena canción,  mantente firme en el evangelio mi amigo.  Mathew 7:14.  Escucha los libros de la verdad.  👍

Just leaving my comment here just in case decades from now it will be on my YT recommendation! Cuz I'm pretty sure it will!! 😉😜
This song is so fucking good.
Yeah this is my broken heart anthem
Songs for main characters to hit the punching bag to.  Not a compliment.
Been looking for this song, didn't imagine it would be this band that played this song. Lmao
Já foram melhores 🤔
Welbutrin and serotonin are anti depressants I’m on or have been on lmao.
💫🐉🩸RH Negative 🩸🐉💫
Dio mio, pues de esperarce la canción es A R T E al igual que todo el repertorio de los dragonsitos
how they sound so different-
This is literally SO BAD LMAOO I can't🤣🤣
Best band ever exist in my opinion
This song is SO SICKKKK
This song is beyond life itself
This sum pump up music bruh
Bro the verses are cool but ion like the chorus
I heard some people talking this song was bad, and now after listening, I regret searching for it. Fucking horrible
My next most favourite song
Wow, this guy is ready for battle. Not only is only one of us going to make it out alive, but he also has an army of kazoos. https://youtu.be/PSAPGjnaKCA?t=118
Music:Listened Me:Misunderstood  The Alive One: Not you  Throat:Dead Hotel:Trivago
https://youtu.be/P1BVdBi-NLI
I love how different this song is 🎧
Que música incrível
Is it just me, or does anyone think imagine dragons made this for a movie?   Sounds like it'd fit well with a fight scene depending on how it's done.
When did ID become so metal LOL?
İmagine black widow edits with ths song
So this is what you get when you drop a track with a sore throat.
imagine corpse husband sang this song with em
This song is fire
Revelation 19:21, NIV: "The rest were killed with the sword coming out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh."  JAY-Z IS GOD IN REVELATION / APOCALYPSE 11:4 AND MORE. I know this because I have had JESUS tattooed on my thigh since BEFORE I read Revelation 19:16 which says, “ On His thigh is a name written: KING OF KINGS LORD OF LORDS “
By powerful people Who get their way. ...  we are all i am an cutthroat
I love this song
me sing to my sis: "ONLY ONE OF US GON' MAKE IT OUT ALIVE AND IT'S NOT YOU!!" cut throat pose sis: "MOMMMMM"
That "try me " line  I screamed with that
THAT SCREAMS! OMFG Simply Awesome!!!

When the quiet kid in elementary school participates in the talent show.
oh my god can't stop laughing at dan (at this song)
Certified villain song. Not gonna change my mind
This song is so underrated :(
22 years LDS I feel this so hard
I NEVER imagined (heh, get it) Imagine Dragons would make a song like this (I haven’t listened to many of their songs though). Well, *expected* is better. But honestly, though I wouldn’t really prefer they make this type of music from now on, this... is really good. It gives me chills down my spine, and I like it.
Bucky barnes/Winter soldier song
Serious Disney villain vibes
GOD THIS SOUNDS LIKE SHIT WHAT HAPPENED TO AMAGINE DRAGONS?
No album after two years :( amazing song though
Aggression is waisting of valueable energi that can be used much better
Thank you, Imagine Dragons. Having recently left the Mormon church, this song and Dan's experience have really hit close to home for me. It has helped me put words to my feelings and my depression stemming from that process. Thank you for speaking your truth. You have no idea how many people it will help, Dan.
Ça dégomme les oreilles Dan 😂❤️
V like Vengeance
This is the one 🔥🤙🏻

Imagine dragons: release cutthroat  Youtubers: LISTENING TO CUTTHROAT AT 3 AM (ALMOST CUT MY THROAT)

AMOOOOO LOS GRITO DE DANIELITOUUUU
COMO QUE A 4000 PERSONAS NO LES GUSTA ESTE TEMAZO:c  SALUDOS DESDE MI CUENTA INSTITUCIONAL AJSHKAHD:3
Omg this song is so gooooood
Nice
Imagine Dragons aren’t really my thing but I like to see them experimenting with their sound
Nice
I pray for the Dan's throat hahahaha
Coming to a major league mashup near you
a powerful song, very strong on sound, lyric, and meaning ♥♪♪
Dude absolutely this song better than 'follow you' 😻😻
This song reminded me billie eilish
This song pulls me one song closer to hell
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
You're so very great voice, Dan
Fans after hearing first line-  Yeah I've been waiting patiently
This is the song that plays when you want some boss battle to attack you
Bruh dan must of cut his throat singing this....this song was right we are gonna make it alive and it’s not him ;-;
Young Fortnite players be like:
When u are in a 1v1 situation in Fortnite arena solos: ONLY ONE OF US GON' MAKE IT OUT ALIVE AND IT'S NOT YOU. when u are in a 1v4 situation with sweats: TRY ME!!!!
Great song but jeez this video scared me
Someone make a toad version PLEASE
Only Ukrainians can recognize in the end of this song word "не розумію" :D
İ love you imagine dragons song=omg song
It's just song made for fast and furious.
"Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you" -- Thought I heard Tom Araya
boa tarde
Britney Spears is bragging about getting the vaccine..     M.gk. isnt a real thing apparently... dmx was murdered..     What a waste of time and energy... for nothing.
Pretty sure this song is against the mormons
Qm gostou?  Eu n gostei .. EU AMEI ACHEI PERFEITO AAAAA
Imagine this song in concert
why all Imagine Dragons song looks a perfect fits for a movie.
I played this song in 12:00 am and Goosebumps is real
so NIN vibes
Compared to follow you, this is clearly the superior song. This is amazing.
I am so stressed by this song 🤣
Кто русский?
HOLY SHIEEEET
😂😂
Try me 👇
Expressive
i was doing karioki for this song
This song feels so 90's
Official Video Need! 🤟
✌︎('ω')✌︎

It's feels just like Survival games ...
F L O P .
Official theme song of going to the gulag
Is there a  live performance of this song? 🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️
I want a Regular Show montage with Rigby to this song.
Here before 3M views
Master peace
Wow 😍
I listen to this songs in loops
They are sooooo underrated
When people been looking down on you, then play this with headphones on full volume. Believe me, you'll feel so fucking badass!
This song brings me a weird sense of comfort when I'm angry lol
I just love the fact that this song goes from 'I've been waiting patiently' to 'ONLY ONE OF US GON' MAKE IT OUT ALIVE, AND IT'S NOT YOU' in 32 seconds.
⚡⚡
They went so hard for what? They went unnecessarily hard. But they did it, they did it for us and we appreciate that ❤️
Cool  song  becos  i  love  song😘🤩😍🥰
Oh damn what on earth is this? You guys are so creative. We never know what to expect.I absolutely LOVE it. Always giving us what we didnt know we needed. 💃💃♥️♥️🔥🔥
I wish there was a little more instruments into the song, but otherwise I enjoy the song. I gives me a sense of Roots+Friction, a song you would find from Smoke + Mirrors. Angry Dan Reynolds is a win
I would LOVE to see how Dan sings this because  I don't  get it
are yall going to make a new album? also is this song and follow you going to be in it? also please answer bc yall are my favorite band.
I would love to see them play this song live.
ohhhhhhh nice
ok i guess
this one is the coolest song ...................................
Best rock I've ever heard <3
Psychopathic vibes, anyone?

Mejor imposible
Hola, amigo mìos!

Suena increíble hasta parece otra banda
Feels as if I'm watching an eruption of spiritual deconstruction in action.
Such a different vibe to follow you. I love it!
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The dislikes are from the people who couldn't make it out alive.
dam imagine dragons never make a bad song              I feel like the world would end if they ever make a bad song
Wtf is this cool song which makes my room to third war😎
OMG IM SPEECHLESS THIS IS SOO CLASS
Even years later, they’re still producing classics
Thx for uploading. If you have a minute come watch our music videos - We're an indie rock band and think you might dig our sound. Appreciate it.
MANIA HYPERBOLE
This song is a disaster..............
2:11 is the part where I start plotting an animalistic fit of rage and revenge against the bullies in life...
I literally play this song in my car  end i didn't feel myself until i was going at 200km per hour my adrenaline went up for some reason
We need a music video for this 🔥🔥🔥🔥
excelente
im
in Love 😍😍😍😍
The opening is so similar to Castle by halsey
A lowkey person wearing headphone listing to this!!! TRYYYYYY MEEEEEEE!!!!
Very much *UNDERRATED*
OH BABY, A TRIPLE.... OHHHH YEAHHHHHHHH
I'm scared to see who this song is directed towards 😬🤣
Senti o arrepio que as msc antigas me causavam
Wow! Way to go! Now just imagine this song played live.

11:39
ONLY ONE OF US NOT YOU is what I say when flys land on my Food

This is masterpiece. It terrifies me, but I love it. It's crazy what Dans voice can do.
damn it fits for AOT AMV or sountrack. like 100 percent
Best💙
I love I too feel the same XXX ♥️☮️🌟🌟🌟

Dan's voice is so damn POWERFUL!! Love this song!

I love their new songs follow you and cutthroat. I love that even though some band members have changed they're still able to produce amazing songs
How is follow you more popular than this?
Uhm sub urban vibez
it sounds like the singer is lossing his voice
Amoooooo❤🇧🇷

Imagine going from songs like Radioactive to all the grabage theve released since. Lol the band jusy out here trolling everyone
I really wanna see a live version of this!!!!
Sinister theme 2.0))))

That's why we are fan of Imagine dragons😘😘
Wow, that 2nd verse I really connected with.
I NEED THE OFICIAL VIDEO NOWWWWWW♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
YEEEAAH!!!

I have been waiting for this one!!!!
The song is awesome.  The clip 🤔 could be way better
POV: You are watching the end credits of Fast & Furious 9
And its not you
Theres no way dan will be able to sing this live💀
Se imaginan que en los conciertos abran con este rolón, epico
YO ESTOY IMPACTADA CON ESTE ROLÓN, Y NO ME IMAGINO COMO VA ESTAR EL ALBUM
...boleh habis suara aku
meh
This song is so fucking motivational and special... Thank you from us all!
I feel like an opporotunity was missed with this song in that Gethsemane refers to Mark 12 in the bible, and these songs were published on Mar. 11th. One more day and it would've been perfect!  In all honesty though these two new songs are some of my favorites so far! I'm so glad to see that these guys spent their quarantine wisely. Can't wait to see them on tour!
I learnt some new words today
Dan Reynolds is gonna be in a lot of top 10 lists in the future!
This is not the Imagine Dragons I’m used to... BUT ITS AMAZING
The artwork in this video is truly amazing.
Hahaha vocal sounds worse than nickleback or creed generic pop song
Nice ONE ....THIS WAS REALLY THOUGHT OUT.......I THOUGHT EMENIM WAS GONNA JUMP IN AT END 😂 😂
Me: *says why I think I am right while adhering to my mom's opinion* Mom: 1:56
Only one of us hahahahaha
In love with this song
Y'know, I've loved Imagine Dragons for years, but while they went hard as fuck in this song, I don't really like it
Ive been listening to imagine dragons since 2013...        *i just realized I’m not subscribed.*
Like se sei italiano 👇
Imagine Dragons: "I've been played by powerful people who get their way..." Billie Eilish: "We're all sad as hell. All these artists, we're sad as shit dude." Dave Chappelle: "What's happening in Hollywood? ...Maybe the environment is a little sick."
So imagine dragons released a daamn soothing song and a fire blazing  song at the same time...whoa
This is very much Nine Inch Nails...
Imagine Dragons posting vids again
1.st trash song , well everybody have one
I’m back and I see they are upping their music steering away from their pop like state I’m glad
This song is like warriors
TEMON EN TODAS LAS LETRAS <3
Amazing!
TRY ME
Oh my shattered nerves! Love Love Love it.
When youre wrestling with your inner self or inner demon i would say, this would be a nice anthem to survive the battle
#lovethis
Wow! Wish, my songs would be nearly so cool...
Great for using as an advertisement for sure👌
This make me remember natural
I love this song, my least favourite part it the very end, but the verses man are fire and the Chorus showcase the rough vocals I love from Dan
I didn’t ask to watch a dying fly
currently this song its soo underrated but im sure its gonna blow up
OMG WTF THIS SONG IS AWESOME ITS LIKE THEY KNOW WHAT TYPE OF MUSIC I'M INTO
i like this song  because  very unique, and very fowerfull. LOVEYY SONGS  is so stupie, and so boring. don't worry  imaginedragone. you created  very GOOD SONG❗❗❗😃😃😃😃
I am all about heavy metal but that is horrible and hope they make no money off it, your money is not good to me!!!!
Meu Deus. Imagine Dragons é vida
the song’s cool, but it’s serOtonin (btw English isn’t my native language)
IVE BEEN WAITING
Insane asylum animations are gonna start getting made from this song... my lord it is amazing :0
when the song MOVES YOU
Awashcala patas de pollo echate. Un pun
This Poor Mans Throat... Anyone else concerned about this?!
😱😱😱😱😱😲😲😲😲
I love them imagine dragons 🤩🤘
Heard this song on a ufc add after I listened to it
MEU DEUS SAUDADESSS
He's trying to recreate the magic of "one step closer".....try and keep trying untill you reach there Dan
best im song since friction
Waiting for AMV on sasuke with this song. It's gonna be best.
I get sad seeing some people critising both follow you and cut throat. I mean it's ok to criticize I guess but damn I got sad hearing them. Felt like I have bad taste in music And I'm just being an weirdo!!
Good Job👍👍👍👍👍👍
Eh, the verses are solid but I’m not a big fan of the chorus. Probably won’t listen to this one much :/
This song gives me Billie Ellish vibes
1st listen: meh, it's ok. 2nd listen: actually its pretty good 3rd listen: ok this is a certified banger 4th listen: ONLY ONE OF US GON MAKE IT OUT ALIVE AND IT'S NOT YOU!
that scream "TRY MEEEEEEEAHHHHHHH"   me: died
The dislikes were from people who did not cut their throats
Alguna persona que hable español este 2021 sabado 27 de marzo
Godzilla v Kong vibes 🔥
SUPEEEERRR FÃ, MELHOR MÚSICA .....
I`ve  Been WAITING PATIENTLY 😎💯 it is really good 👍
And I couldn't wait for the next single, What a disappointment, this song is nothing like you guys.
This is literal garbage
Superb
Only one of us! Not you! Imagine dragons

AAA YES!!!! I LOVE THE NEW SONGS!!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
AWESOME
Happy Weekend... I have watched this a few times but I did not know what to say ... as i can’t lie... I have had days like these 🥲.... but when I do I try to listen to your other songs to bring me back to being in a quiet happy place 💜
Solo ellos hacen un regreso tan brillante
Gak bisa bahasa Inggris 🗿
The screaming.....it's not good.
Cutthroat >>>>> Follow You
scary
🇧🇷
Humanity in 40k: ONLY ONE OF US GONNA MAKE IT OUT ALIVE AND IT'S NOT YOU!
I feel like this belongs in a movie or something. This is another level.
This is lowkey creepy but way too fun. Wth😂
They should switch to more of a darker sound than a radio friendly pop band
Its Monday
I can't say anything that isn't I love all, ALL of your songs, fr they're so GOOD
Das klirrt aber gewaltig
Really makes me want to direct a real badass villain movie...
Dan: “Only one of us gon’ make it out alive.” And Now a word from our sponsor... Their sponsor: *TRYYYY MEEEEE!*      *TRYYYY MEEEEE!*
Что за Били Айлиш по Эмеджендрегански 😅
This is the song that I would put on the opening of The Punisher
This is the best fresh rock song I've heard in years. Period.
LEGENDS ARE BACK 3<
nice
No puedo creer lo infravalorada que está esta canción :((((
Cutthroat > follow you (still love both)
The ready crown contemporaneously moor because barbara reassuringly protect to a lonely patricia. thundering, best lycra
Good grief that was bad. I think I'd rather listen to Rebecca Black's "Friday" on repeat until I take my last breath than listen to this a second time.
The voices are weird in this.   Hopefully someone can cover w/a pop version.
I could do w/out the dead bug images.
Here's what I noticed about this song: while other songs are about being faithful to someone and loving them, this is more like fighting for yourself. It's a weird contrast with Follow You.
I can’t live?
I’m a kid 👧🏻 so I can’t live
2:28 that sounded like "yet im a noob"
Lyric video make a video very crazy
"gon make it out alive" this is a hunter x hunter referençe?
Snk final season op vibes from this!
saluda a los latinoamericanos
good muisic
buena cancion
Damnnnnnnnnnnnn!!
his voice sounds like he is vomiting
There's at least 3,600 lame Imagine Dragons fans
Hello Imagine Dragons you miusic wood
GOD OF WAR
Ngl, the style of singing used in the verses sound kinda "Billie Eilish style" inspired, in my opinion at least
Imagine dragons ❤️
This song should be played on a good fps game 🔥
🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳👍👍👍👍👍
I feel lika im watching *RING* 's video (those weird af images, sky, birds etc) nd  got 1 week before my death . ☠️
This is the first imagine dragons song i absolutely dislike
OMG IM SO SHOCKED I NEVER THOUGHT THEY EOUKD MAKE A SO G LIKE THIS OMGGGG IM IN LOVE OMG IM IN LOVE
This is like hardcore blood in the water
I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOUR MUSIC VERY PATIENTLY AS WELL 🤩
Only one of us is gonna like this song more and it's not you!!
what the heck was that my ears died but wierdly, il liked it
The lyrics are goddamn unbelievable
The beginning deadass confused and scared the shit outta my cat lmaoooo
Only one of us gon' make it out alive.... TRY MEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!
0:42
Imagine Dragons is reemerging!! Good to see you guys are still working on new songs!
Someone took a page Directly from the Book of KORN
This is kinda Hunger Games-ish.
Te amo cutthroat pinche canción espectacular 🥰❤️
I remember when i was sitting in my room vibin to roots and now I'm doing the same but with alot more nostalgia

2021/3/24 .. 11:16pm
Only artists who understand life and death, the reality of human soul, can understand and enjoy this song ❤
1:33 if creeper has a voice..
Maaaan, Goosebumps 🤯
This needs a mv...
JFHDHDHDH NEW SONG AFTER 2 YEARS??? BYEE
TEMOOOOOOOOOOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They should make a version with guitar riff, more aggressive sound, adding more beat to it, It could give more balance between Dan's voice and the melodie, I feel like they should also pull the voice a little. In a way it feels like a raw version of the song.
when ı get bored from solving math ı open this and get charge with their energy. they are insane...

This song in lot of trailers. Coming soon
Me: I sit in the summer, I don't bother anyone  Mosquito in my room: 1:49
This is going straight to "feeling like a villain" playlists
Man they really separated themselves from their prior sound. Fucking love it
this is totally my style, i just want them to play this at the concert 😩
AOT OP FINAL SEASON: Same energy
I'll just say that's how I imagine the Godzilla Vs King Kong credits
It's more like proving a point than actually singing 🤣🤣
All that shouting😂😂😂.....
Wow!!!
This album is gonna be Cut Throat #imaginedragons are HOLY thanks for the sample
༼ ༽☆           ╰(⸝⸝⸝´꒳`⸝⸝⸝)╯
still making masterpieces
My throat hurts
Both new songs are way too far out of Dan's themes this is kinda dissapointing... Hopefully some better stuff comes out... Hm  ..also you can't just shout words with little to no actual musical talent to it and call it a song and if you were trying to make a screamo song.. you're way off.
Idk but this song reminder me to TØP
This song is completely opposite of follow you 😀
FVCKING FIRE ! ! !
Play this at x1.25 speed; Thank me later.
Espero no se suicide misteriosamente después de esta canción o que lo empiezen a difamar que tenía problemas de algo
i am going to make a godzilla vs kong mv... I have spoken
I feel like both of the songs on this album are completely different. I love it though
Woah
a ft Kendrick Lamar it would be on fire!!
Sounds like a mix between Britney Spears and Nine inch nails 😅
i want them to win grammys  \ >.< /
This song will add in new wwe game 😂😂 2k22 mark my words boys😂😂
oh so hard for me to sing along 😂 but still like this song 🔥
Resident Evil: Village theme song? Just Predict my future
Don't know why this sounds like cradles
I thought it was Billie Eliish😂😂😂
This is very 😫
Strong vocal 🔥
This is Rick Rubin style and i love it
I' love
I swear every song they make is extremely good in its own way.
Просто вау...Я влюбилась в эту песню, вы меня приятно удивили! С каждым альбомом вы превосходите себя, хотя каждый раз я уверена, что это был предел совершенства! Безумно круто, обожаю такие песни
This will be UFC Fight Night theme song. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Me: imagine dragons cant surprise me anymore Imagine dragons *making this masterpiece* Me: 👁👄👁
As an exmo this song speaks to my soul! Get em Dan!!!
this is the worst song i have ever heard in my life.  I used to be a fan of night visions and their earlier albums, but idk if they've sold out, ran out of ideas, or just naturally became terrible artists, but this song makes me actually angry.  It sounds like whispering and then a cat in a blender, trying to be cool in front of its friends who are staging a fake WWE match in their undies.  I can't believe i actually listened to this.
Brutal aber gut
wheres Korn when you need them, because this would be some even more badass if that happened or remixed.
Guys... Are you okay? Cause it sounds like you are very much 𝙉𝙊𝙏, please take good care of yourselves 😳🥺🥺🥺
1:47 Is it just me, or is this Haus Labs instrumental? :o
I Love u imagine dragons
we want songs like dream
*serotonin 😅
YES SIR!!!!! Love the grittiness of his vocals.
i came here after Follow You and the sudden vibe change lmaoooo kjdshkjhdfv
Dan said this song was about doing battle with his own self-pity. That's right. This is a POSITIVE song.
If Imagine Dragons was produced by Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails...
The mood of the song and video remind me of AHS
Perfect boss fight music :)
How to go from "Love" to "Cutthroat" 🤣
when i first heard this and follow you i didnt get the imagine dragon vibei usually do and didnt think it was their songs but the more i listen to the two of them the more i feel it and the more i like them
"Only one of gone make it out alive and it's not you!!"
This song is now one of my favorite imagine dragon song.
That piano in the background adds a lot.
I've been waiting for this song my entire life and I didn't know it
Crudo
This feels like smoke and mirrors shiz
I NEED THIS AS MUSIC VIDEO!!!!
Sounds like prophecy to me......
this man sus 😳
Would you look at that, this song sucks, the song doesn't match the lyrics, maybe just maybe, he's reaching out to the tone deaf, imagine that...
Omg AHS vibes everywhere here ...I love it
Try me! Good song from Dragons with aesthetic mv. Just wow!
That's a dragon's roar! Good  song with aesthetic mv. Just wow!
this is so good
OMG🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Can anyone tell me if Daniel Reynolds is Rh Negative? His blood type, does anyone know??
This song fits perfectly for a misguided villain. Lol.
I think it is cradle copy
Sir I like your all song but this song gives me thrilling experience and is dangerous
Repeat mode... 😜🎧
Pov: you're the emo kid trying to fall asleep to this
Don't know why so many people are disliking this masterpiece...❣️🔥🔥

Oh yeahhSss
ESPN just found their new SportCenter intro music...
đỉnh quá aaaaaaaaaaa
This gives me horror vibes
I love how cutthroat and follow you are so different that you could think are from different bands
Anyone getting Nine Ince Nails vibes?
I appreciate you made this!
Eu amei muito!!! Vocês São incríveis,  amarei vocês para sempre.  🥰😍
ohhh god this song is just amazing you guys are just amazing !!
No wrrrreszcie wrócili!!!!😍
It sounds like intro of an anime... 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 SONG IS LIT .
Is
DIESES  LIED CUTE !!! IM LOVE ☺🤩🤩😊🤩🤩❤😍😍😍
Kinda sounds like Nine inch nails
So at the end of the song is the line “get on the knee” or is it “It isn’t you” it’s, like, the only line they don’t “translate” or whatever.
I’m so happy right now I have waited a whole year and a half for new music the day if finally here
I think I found the perfect song for my workout
Cool💖
Wow! This is it ;)
His fucking voice 🔥, i love this
He escuchado esto en velocidad 2.0 sin querer pensaba que estaba en un concierto de korn.
calm
The fuck 😳
Hmmm.. Gives me an mgk ft. Corpse daywalker... Billie eilish bad guy vibe... Is this the way forward for music now?
Lots of love from INDIA
Need a metal cover of this asap
WOOOW!
Hardcore
IN LOVE AS ALWAYS!   IF YOU ASK ME WHATS MY FAVORITE SONG OF THEM, THE ANSWER IS THAT I DONT REALLY KNOW !  THEY ARE THE BEST!❤😍💕💖❤❤❤❤❤
Holy f***. This is amazing 🤘🏻🖤
So we have to listen to this for 5 years until they try again? I just unsubscribed.
The Devil spared my life when he saw me hearing this song.
This is the Music played during a party in hell.
This has a 100% chance of becoming a theme song in the fighting industry.
.
Man, Imagine Dragons could have been so good... shame.
This would make such a badass UFC fight song
I’m sorry but what is that kazoo solo at 1:58
Omag !!😳❤️
another new one!
God, this takes me back to the S + M album. It reminds me of I'm So Sorry and Friction. Kinda missed this type of music from them tbh, cuz Evolve didn't have any songs like that, and Origins only had like 1 or 2. Definitely one of my favorites from them now :D
One divorce, two incredible songs.
This song is The lyric structure of "Halseys-Castle" and "Kendrick Lamar-Humble" guitar riff background structure.
يمه
I overhauled their past releases last year. Then the pandemic appeared. Listened to each one. Still no cure. Am I pre-ordering this new stuff? Perhaps not.
it's not bad, but not really the songs I think about when I think Imagine Dragons. I feel many of their songs are about surviving or living with depression.... or those are the ones I gravitate toward. >.>
A lot of screaming
Repórtense los hispanos aquí  | V
Marisco, que emocionate! Recuerdo cuando tenia 16 y cantaba a todo pulmon
Marilyn Manson ft Imagine Dragons
This sounded so hot 🔥
Amazing so goooood
Good one🖤
Amei
THIS IS SO FUCKIG AMAZING
Perfect song 💥👌
Finally after years thank god
I feel like this song would suit American Horror Story very well!!
Damn, this is different than their usual! It's fresh... I like it.
the teacher when you don't turn in your homework:
...
TRRRRRY MEEEEEEE!!!!!
E
FIRE
I didn't like this song Then I listened to it about 15 times Now I like it
The crying rant is horrible and ruined that song....
I feel like a Mixture of Machine ,Radioactive and Natural........
uhhh. I guess I have something to say. Utah is, like, the opposite of plains... Like... The entire thing is comprised of hills. And not rolling hills. These are jagged hills. I knew someone who had job driving people past the hills who didn't feel comfortable doing it themselves because they thought the "mountain" was going to fall on them.
Thats the kinda song i have been waiting from IMAGINE DRAGONS. They do "WHAT EVER IT TAKES" to give the best for the existing generation with full on conviction. DAAAMN that last BGM gave goosebumps.
Muse??🤣😂
They own my ears
This song sounds like a clean version of Nine Inch nails' song closer to be honest with y'all
https://youtube.com/channel/UC5whtODkaKzMZvqvwICUoyA
May i know what this kind of music is this is it pop or what, I'm new here and I have never listened to such a masterpiece, and btw what the Fandom name for imagine dragons ,I'm in I'm in .
This sounds like me one time this my theme song
Heard the music , and I was legit waiting for "first things first" the whole time.
When a sperm see his mate fighting to reach the ova first  0:40
Follow you+Cutthroat is like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
Title:Cutthroat  Dan:Yeah I did this to make the song perfect.
LOVE IT!!
The melody in the background and the drum pattern at the end literally sounds like Yin Yang by USS😂
Parece racionais o beat kkkkk
🔥🔥🔥
Love the edgy sound to this song!!
Imagine this song is from a saw movie
ohhhhh god. This is so trash. Minimalist metal vocals over a recycled logic drum beat.
TRYYYYYY MEEEEEEEEEEEE
This could be for sure in a Final Destination sequel....awesome song guys!
Are they saying "Adam and Eve" at the end?
Yeah I hear it
You *know* this is gonna be played at a hell of a lot of sports games.
I love the part where it says cutthroat in the background with that echo, it sounds so cool
🔥
EU AMO ESSA MÚSICA AAAAAA
Brasileiros? 🇧🇷
A ufc fighter needs to come out to this song!
I love this great one
How good would this be as MMA walk on music
Oh my God, this is crazy
Trash
You have no idea how much this songs have helped me man, than you!!
🦹🦹🦹
Ufffff😍😍😍😍
The lyrics are well thought out. Fantastic song!!!
Feeling like a Psycho path
People that disliked are all dead now cause they.......cut their throats. 🤷🏼‍♀️
Pinches prros creí que no regresarían, pero lo hicieron y con este rolon para sentirse un psicópata en película. Los amo.
It's the best song that I've ever listened. Thank you, guys
Cutthroat sounds like a villain like joker but more psychopath
Its very good
this fucking BUMPS
This's gonna be my favorite song!!
WTF?!?!?!
This may have to be my new - in your face theme song 🐅
AHS vibes
Cutthroat
Aight I'm gonna say it, Cutthroat > Follow You
Это просто ОГОНЬ!!!
i t ' s i n t r e s t i n g                  but not my thing..
Giving me Friction vibes and I love it!!!
just stop. COVID is already enough guys. haven't we suffered enough as a species?
it's good but im not surprised
This song is so interesting, it’s like a rock song, but in the pre-chorus is like a mixture of blues and hip-hop, the the chorus and ending is rock. I don’t even know which genre to describe the verses😂. I feel this will be the perfect song to work out to. Awesome job!
Pov : your first language isn't English and you can't understand most of the lyrics
Quite possibly the worst Imagine Dragons song I’ve ever heard. I’m all for change and if that’s what they want then it’s fine, but I miss Smoke and Mirrors Imagine Dragons.
Estoy segura de que en una parte dice, "Era mentira"
Oh, this is sick sound design
The contrast between this and Follow You is awesome! Can’t wait for the new album!
From start
Not tryna hate but this is pretty bad imo
No vocal cords were harmed in the making of this song
vem pra cima!!
Pure Emotionen in diesem Song!😍
https://youtu.be/-pHNCkERZuY
💙
I don't understand the end of everything because English is not my hobby ... but I have the impression that I am listening to a thriller
😳.   Woah.   Dark.   Love ❤️ it
the very definition of Artist
It's ok. It's definitely not as good as night visions or smoke and mirrors (by far their two best albums)
wth bro
OWW THEY'RE TRULYY BAACK!!
Ben Türküm (kimsenin görneyeceğinden eminim)
Me encanta!! Siento esa vibra de rock clásico me encantaaa!!
Сколько живу такого еще трека не слушал, просто сами послушайте https://youtu.be/X_SXjpuJKKs
When you step on a Lego.
That hook make me goosebump tho 🤯
WHAT THE F.... :D
what the
THE LEGENDS IS BACK
That's great 😍
Soothing.
Always PERFECT
Everyone stand aside! Daddy's back.
AND IS NOT YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
This song is amazing especially the pre-chorus, but if they changed the chorus to be more smooth and took out the scremo stuff at the end it would dominate the charts
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤💚
how many are waiting for the music video
Yesss!!!
meanwhile eren in the corner:
Natural+Machine huh?!
wanna see this as bgm in a movie with a badass anti hero........
Yo alas 11 pm xd 2:25 Quiero dormir quiero dormir..... Xd
Can't wait for more in this album!  (If it is an album, I don't know)
I love this song.   I mean, I love all their songs so... but damn LOVE. THIS.
Machine+Natural = Cutthroat
First line defines the feelings of every fans.  "I've been waiting patiently" 😌
1:55 This guys throat must hurt
It seems scary when driving or homework or anything else dangerous
Not bad tho
It sounds so different from his other songs
Some Sia and Labrinth a good addition?
The dragons come back! 🐲🗯️
This is different 👍
The people who disliked need a covid test, because they have no taste
This was so good
This song kinda reintroduced my to my 14 year old self. Not gonna lie, I still dig his music choice.
Lowkey sounds like Lying From You by Linkin Park
Imagine Dragons: only one of us go make it out alive and it's not you Me: what have I done 🤷
Чё ж с вами стало(
There is very little evidence that people with depression have a shortage of Serotonin. Even if it was true, Wellbutrin doesn't affect serotonin. It's a NDRI, not an SSRI. Meaning it works on norepinephrine and dopamine, not serotonin. Song still slaps though
This is, is pure me. X
Omg
maybe he had to do this song last on the album so he'd have a voice for the rest of the songs.
Is it just me or does this sound like Nine Inch Nails "Closer"?
Yes please. I needed this.
I love the power of the song, amazing
This would make a great theme song for a performer in AEW or WWE...just sayin
Imagine dragons...      Imagine dragon deez balls across ur face
Took me 3 listens... but this is now in my playlist. Welcome back imagine dragons!
Rick Rubin knows how to get the best out of every artist 🔥🔥
Love it ❤️ 😀
I love these songs
This song needs to be in BOYS 2
I missed you so much I love you♥
Why does this remind me of attack on titans?!
TRY ME
This is the Imagine Dragons I was waiting for, so powerfull 😍😍 100/10 I would recommend
Size bir tek işkenceye uğrayıp gebereceniz bir şey veriyorum artık.
Travis
¿Alguien más se imagino esta canción en american horror story?
Something new
I think it's OK like it
Never considered myself an Imagine Dragons because I've always thought their music has been boring/formulaic, but this song is really experimental for them. I like that they're trying something new. Pretty cool!
it gives me horror movie vibezzzzzz
Огонь!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This feels like Billie elish song but performed my imagine dragons
Dan give your voice some rest dude
DIOS
makes me dance!
This too good 💥💥
op dragons
What is happening???
Top
why this ins't in the top charts yet?
The Pre-Chorus sounds almost like something from The Score.
Me: has headphones on listening to this My Computer: Do you wish to continue your class?
Thank you all for coming. We’re gathered here today to honor the memory of a once great rock and roll band. One that was supposed to bring true rock n roll back into the spot light. In a world drowning in pop and hip hop on the billboard hot 100, this band was supposed to be the only shining example that rock and roll was still alive and could still be relevant. For years they waged this just and righteous war, introducing rock music to the next generation.   Alas, the fight proved to be just too much. Songs once teaming with life, emotion, and passion turned into a barren wasteland of garage band drums, piano, and synth. Songs that once featured the thoughts and ideas of all 4 members of the band now seem to be hijacked by the maniacal pop ambitions of a madman.   We take this time to remember imagine dragons not as they are, but as they once were. It’s been a great ride but Where as today it is Imagine Dragons, we all shall fall. May God have mercy on them so one day they may crawl back from the abyss. But you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. Thank you, and good night.
Person: I bet you don't know every single song from imagine dragons Me: 1:56
If they perform this live, I think it will have to be the last song of the night, no way Dan's throat recovers from this!
wow
Auh finally ecstasy
It's really great song!!! Thanks from Ukraine!
Like Whaaaaaaaaaat!? :D :D :D :D
I'm so misunderstood and I'm broke hahahaha. At least you have money to win.
Its Fantastic.
this cures moday morning grumpiness... PERSCIPTION: take until u feelz like a hooman
💕💕💕💕
How can he do this without absolutely ruining his voice?? Cause that's amazing.
Me talking to the voices inside me "only one of us gon make it out alive and it's not you cutthroat"😒☹️😌
my throat is hurt listening this
Dan: I AM SOOOOO .... me:  SORRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY Dan: misunderstood. me:...
I feel like a psychopath now 🎧📿...
I prefer follow you cause its the natural sound of imagine dragons
Dear dragons, please keep doing such INCREDIBLE art
Digital + friction = Cutthroat
This song is so innovative and amazing that it can't be a hit
I need its live performance
Needs a breakdown;p
I am hoping for an epic official Video for this song ! fingers crossed !
😴
😳😳😂
0:41 I shouted in my room..........i swear.
Beautiful
When is the official video coming out? Cannot wait ❤️
I thumbs downed....but I liked it....The part where *"Only one of us will make it out alive and it's not you"*....killed me
❤️❤️
❤️
🤘🏻💥💯😵
Gulag description: 1:32
This is real good
Looks like a werewolf series trailer, I love it
When crush says you are too weak to go to gym and lift weights  Me: 1:56
When bullies says you are a wimp  Me: 1:56
When your crush says you can't even get it up to do it with me  Me: 1:56
1:56 Dan going Super Saiyan
i like it =)
hell yea............ a new song
This song is KAI PARKER talking
Why does this song sound like a priest and an evil villain singing together?
Wow the wait was really worth it thx Imagine Dragons :)
Ya me imagino lo delirante que va a ser poder escuchar esta canción en vivo, cuando los conciertos vuelvan a la normalidad.
I'm so misunderstood, But I live for this💯👽
The Best
Verga evolucionaron como putos pokemones que esto? Esta increible
Who else was listening to this while baslilong flipping?
I just came from listening to Follow You like "that's a nice song" then I hear this like "geez is Dan a psychopath"
Absolutely 🎊🎊🎊🙏🏻 amazing 🎊
Try in 1.5x its 😻
Meu amor de Deus, que musicao porraaa
Eren Yeager's theme song
Okay guys, we hear you loud and clear... You want another Beat Saber pack.
Que temazo por Dios
The first time I've enjoyed an Imagine Dragons
guys dan is my uncle im famous now!!
Oh yeeeeessss!!!! I really missed you guys 😁😘
didn't like it actually this is not music its just screaming
I have noticed that "TRY ME" in video from instagram and already when I was in love with this sound, now my love is double 😍
The title should be:  A Sucker for Natural Friction.
Fun fact: You don't hear this song, you FEEL it.
The hungry narcissus analogically spell because lettuce dewailly rob afore a oceanic powder. mindless, green grey grieving change
I mean the production is really good
I prefare songs more like "thunder" or "whatever it takes" but not bad
I love how their songs are always above and beyond!
So who we killing?
Este tema está durito
who is AC/DC to you?
Oh god this is ... SO ...... I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY  ITS JUST SO ....                                                 ART !!
I hope they make a movie one day and its action packed and with a villain that we are actually rooting for cause he's just so charming and in the end scene he's walking away with a long black jacket and he stops, he looks back and smirks and then this song starts playing.
Let's Gooo Been Waiting For This For A Long Time
Сборка на новый альбом?
Congratulations for the new album👌🏻
It's so dark and I like that
Imagine Nine Inch Nails Dragons
I love this band soooooo muchhhhh!!!!! 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
I love the dynamic in this song and how much you’ve experienced with genres over all these years-  Shows how talented you are how you can create a song like this and follow you... NICE WORK
"RADADADA DUMBLA" this sounds good xD
You realize in 30 years this will be the song they play at fights, at hockey games, at events worldwide.  This is going to grow.
Quanto cazzo è bella porca madonna
Me jamming to this song: well this is a bit demonic for Dan Reynolds isn’t it? The demon summoned in my room by the song: agreed
I like how he straight up calls out mormonism
And my gym trainer got another song to motivate me.
Am I the only one who got LP vibes? Great song!! Chester would be proud!
sooooooo good😍
😍😍😍😍
mds do céu eu ainda não superei
This will be a good song for the upcoming suicide squad film🔥
Official quite kid anthem
This is instantly going to my favourites
Me : listen this...   Me in my brain : *The Promised Neverland*
yes
Is it bad that so many of ImagineDragon's songs fit so many of my characters in a book series that I am writing?
THIS IS THE IMAGINE DRAGONS I LOVE ! LIVIN' FOR IT
THE BEST BAND OF THE WORLD! ❤
This is well wierd not sure if i like it or not yet but its defenitnly a new derrection
🔥💜🙏💜🔥
Some  pieces of this song will be used in memes!!
Great...give me the anime for it ╮(╯▽╰)╭
One word: ROUGH
Nine inch nails vibe
I was thinking the opening of american horror story when i see this video..
HANDS DOWN THE BEST SONG!!!!!!!!!!! I MISSED YOU GUYS! LOVED IT
at the end of the song you can hear "v neravnom mirie"- what in Russian means, in an unequal world😏
Uau
АААААААААА! НАКОНЕЦ-ТО!!!! Я В ВОСТОРГЕ!!!!!
??????watafoca

IMAGINE DRAGONS IS BACK, this is gonna be a good year
"ONLY ONE OF US GON' MAKE IT OUT ALIVE AND IT'S NOT YOU," Dumbledore said calmly.
the people who disliked didn't make it out alive!
this song is like the definition of 2 people in a hospital room with COVID-19?  (are they releasing an album?)
once tiktok claims this one this'll be ruined :(

I'm in at SERATONIN
1:00 sounds like billi eyelish
If you listen to the beginning like the first one minute of machine and then you can parent to this song it’s basically the same exact thing like the whispering in the rhyming and then the beginning be
what the fuck did I just listen to
Esto  en directo puede ser brutal
Is this Grandson?
featuring Ghostemane ?
I love imagine dragons don’t get me wrong I listen to them every day but this song was way out like it was not what I expected
Loved it!!!! they never dissappoint

Wow!!! Love you 🖤💜
Waow amazing
If I'm not mistaken this is old school hard metal... It's great to hear something like this from Imagine Dragons... Shows their versatility! 💜💜💜
Bury A Friend vibes
this tried too hard to sound badass
sounds like a song that would play during a battle in some superhero movie
Beat it man
I hope they'll use this song for Mission Impossible movie
I hope Dan didn't hurt his vocal cord by singing this song tho.  Ah, that's why they name it Cutthroat
They misspelled serotonin..... >.<
And just like that... my new favorite song
i can feel suicide squad 2 feel
Wtf man .. why you shouting ?
I tried to kill my self. 5 years of hard depression. I lost a man that I loved. He died in my eyes.   That sounds IS WHAT I FEELING SINCE THOSE DAY. That.. chaos in my mind..
Great song
Kong vs Godzilla
ImagineDragons Вы лучшие😎😎😎👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼💙💙💙
Happy Friday everyone💙
Eminem: no lungs Dan reynolds: no throat
God damn it! Dan Reynolds, I had no idea that you have THAT part! Awesome, just awesome. My favorite new one.
Sounds like Dan literally cut his throat making this song😂
Dan Reynolds literally cut his throat singing this song😂
1st time listening : It's trash  2nd time : well it's okay  3rd time : it's cool  4th time : ONLY ONE OF USSS!!!
It reminded me of Hannibal of Mads idk why, I love it!!!
They release absolutely new material after last releasing in 2018 (sorry if im wrong about the year) and  surprise us with THIS? oh oh oh, absolutely worth the fcking wait.

*I'm here*
niceee
Me to my two personalities every night " only one of is gonna make it out alive!"
Damn i can feel his and my throat..
BOOOOOM Finally boomba,
When dragons grow their nine inch nails
Should be a song for Carnage vs Venom movie
It's an anthem for whatever the fuck you want it to be an anthem for. Holy shit.
this song is so weird but im here for it
My local radio station made it sound like it was their reply to the cutthroat music industry and they feared for their record deal. But his money 's good. And he will make it out alive. But not them.. os any of that right  ?? Or is it just a giant publicity stunt.  Both ways... thats brilliant.??!!!??!
💙💙
The scream😍
What’s my fav song? Anything imagine dragons ✌🏼
"You can't just mess up your throat like that, are you nuts? Dan: TRY MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
This song is enough for WW3
1st time: nah I don't like this one 2nd time: this is song is ok 3rd time: damn this is pretty good 4th time: ONLY ONE ONE GON' MAKE IT OUT ALIVE AND ITS NOT YOU cutthroat
One of the most polarising I have ever heard!
I hope his voice is alright after singing this song.
WOW!! This is powerful medicine. Thanks yall!!
I promise one day I will buy your merch.
Я вас обожаю❤❤❤❤❤
Is anybody else getting Trent Reznor vibes?
Yeaahhh rockstar 🤘🏻 HAHAHA
I'm shocked 🔥🔥🔥😎👏🖤
The only thing I can't handle about this song is that cockroach :'v
al guíen q hable en español
I bet I could jam to this when in the zone, but it’s not what I expected. It’s not deep bruh
Unique... That's all i want to say
Thank you imagin dragons
Sound like almost Linkin Park .. hybrid theory album..shut up etc Almost like that.. Wowww awesome good
Violent
why do I get Billie vibes at the beginning
Pobrecita su garganta. ;'(
spooky
Ngl not feeling it
It's not gone be viral, of course... But... Not bad... May be...
Wouuu Ronald
Fun fact: The worst part about this song is that it ends
This is my new fav song
Scaaaary
I love You"ImagineDragons"
you have to get used to this song, but if you hear it more often, it gets in your ears too
so fucking good
Spelled “serotonin” incorrectly. Very cool song though.
The start sounds like pacman
good band ....think about it x
I think this song could be remake with métal cover 😁
Only one of us is making it out alive - Daniel talking to his throat
This is the best song EVER
How did he not get a voicecrack at the cutthroat part????
Сколько тут русских?)
To the dislikers:   Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you!!
WHAT. THE ACTUAL. FUCK. I LOVE THIS
Make oficial music for this song, please!
This song belongs to the smoke + mirrors album.
Super!!!
"WAP is empowering" bich THIS is empowering
way better than "follow you"
This song is not the one I wanted but if the one I needed
didn't like it
This one of those Imagine Dragons songs which you have to listen a few times and then it starts growing on you...
This will probably get buried, but this song reminds me oddly of Death Note. Maybe it's all the clock symbolism in the background?
I do enjoy Imagine Dragons and while I think this song is interesting and experimental I don't think Follow You and Cutthroat are their best songs. I am glad that they did release new songs after 2 years though.
PERFEITOS 😭😭😭😭😭🤩🤩🥰😍💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
am a fan but honestly this one suck🤦
🎃"Only one of us''🎃 🎃"Gon' it out ALIVE"🎃 🎃"And it's not you"🎃  👽"CUTTHROAT"👽  🎃"Only on of us"🎃
hello I am 11 years old and I'm in year 7 and I find your songs sublime and I listen to them every day because you are my favorite singers and therefore I wanted to thank you for all the joy that you brought me by your songs so a big THANK YOU ! : )

Grandson Style
See you in 10 years))
Sounds like my grandma's shit
I'm a die hard Imagine Dragon fan....this song is such a disappointment. 🙃
What the hell did I just listen to?
Wowwwww🔥😍😍😍😍😍
People that are scared of insects watching this like: 🙈                 👕                  👖   I don't think you're a monkey btw, that is just the only emoji that is covering their eyes😂
My mind is saying that I shouldn't like this song but everything else is like hell yes
No one: Potterhead when you tell them you know more about Harry Potter than them: 1:56
Image  dragon rock... ???????????????????
These lyrics feel exactly like the way I felt when I was questioning my religion. It might just be a coincidence, but idk that’s just what I noticed.
Why does watching this make me feel like I'm on drugs?
Woah this is good
Bin Fan durch und durch, aber ich musste nach 1,5 Minuten aus machen! Sorry aber das geht gar nicht. Hoffe dass das Album besser wird als diese Single 😢
Famous song 🎼🎶🎶🎹🎸😘😘😎🌹❤️🌹😊🎻 Thank you 💯
Heyyyy........ tell me that this is inspiration from nine inch nails
Antes q salga en tiktok
vous régaler continuer comme sa ps: rpz les fr
IMAGIN DRAGON'S I REALLY LOVE YOUR BAND ... I'M EXPECTING FORM MONTHS BUT😭 😂😂🤣🤣😁
To everyone who once listened to it and said "nah"  come back
Beats cleard all the tensions in my mind
The ultimate running song
Oh my f*cking lord finally a song worthy of bringing trippy bass music into the public eye .. well done boys
🖤
Now you can understand some of the images on the instagram post. Can't wait for the upcoming videos
Kaz Brekker song

Se extrañaba escuchar ese sonido ❤
Pinagalitan ako wtf!😆 puro walang taste nasa loob ng bahay
I am befire 100 0000 views
this is weird
Los extrañabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
This is probably as close as Imagine Dragons are going to get to being emo
Can’t wait to listen to the new album. This should be scary movie’s theme song.
🥺Me encanta
This is the experimental shit I loved so much on Smoke and Mirrors... It's finally baaaaack
Tots es de Balears aquí
💜💜💜Arteeeeeee💜💜💜
I just have one word after listening your new song guy's and it's WOUAWWW! I love your songs and from my little Belgium I have been following your group for 5 years and I find you Awesome!Do not change! You are perfect! I hope to see you in concert  as soon as it is be possible! :-)
For me, this isn't imagine dragons song this is just rick rubin production. I think Dan reynolds send a demo of this song to rick rubin and i think the demo sound like an imagine dragons if you hear closely 'only one of us gone make it out alive' its sound like Rise up. But when rick rubin produce the song he totally changed the song into a hip-hop heavy metal i don't know what i called the genre of this song i like to see the live performances of these song.
This just fits so well into a movie soundtrack, it has that vibe and sound. Maybe a superhero movie, or something like that. Yea..yea~
Alta sorpresa me mandé, TREMENDO TEMA :)
Это моя любовь!!! Невероятно круто!!!💖💖💖 (I'm from Russia. Hello😀 It's song - it's my new love!)
The sound is like, terrible for me. But the lyrics are FIRE!
I'm so misunderstood
Wow
This song is perfect for deadpool!
Mesa Likeyyy
I love this song
I took an auditory slap
yay New song
mds é mta perfeição pra uma banda só
Miss the old Imagine Dragons but happy to see them shine
So Cutthroat just snatched the Top 5 from the list of my favourite Imagine Dragon songs of all time.....  *sigh* I'm so sorry "I'm so sorry"
Its been a while since ive stopped being a fan but this isnt bad.
But you are NOT the ONE, sorry, but you are only a part to make THE ONE alive! Come on and find me! Pooh, I forgot, that somebody is cancelling mails and conversations out of my accounts, and their new Drones flying around me, but I can’t define those, because they never landed in the garden, where I worked out and no one came to speak the throat with the cut out! All is fake, faker at the moment, when all start the fuck to fakeners, will suck the forsakeners on Earth! But hey, your money has the same machine gun blood thumb on the spiritual warroom! You are not living in heaven and on toilet you kneel deep, to get the dirt out, like me and the neighbors in the hoodie, like the effect in the middlemoodie!
We don't need another Billie Eilish clone. Stop it.
this song is  a F****** MASTERPIECE
"Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you" - The way he screams this gives me AC/DC vibes 😂
OH MY GOD IT BECOMES MY FAVOURITE SONG I LOVE YOU, IMAGINE DRAGONS
Cool !
Band:imagine dragons  Song:English  Comment:Spanish  Me:confused  Hotel:trivago
Who else gets Doom vibes when he starts screaming "try meee" towards the end of the song? Kinda makes wanna play Doom eternal with this song playing
This song is surprisingly okay for an Imagine dragons song
wow,,,they didnt disappoint again! AS HORRIBLE AS USUAL
now MEDIA PLEASE DONT RUIN THIS SONG FOR ME DONT MAKE IT RADIATION 2.0
I wonder what they will name the album I think 'To hell and back' because of how there will be one chaotic and one follow youish side.  Edit: nvm just realized other people made songs with the same name
Its been a while since i heard something so good, love this agressive sound from ya guys! Waiting for more <3
Nice I listen to this to fall asleep😂
Ex Mos in the comments be like: Dan, you ok bro?
Legend
semi tusto iftu trut hayu this is not spanish i can speak english
the dislikes are the humans who cannot imagine dragons
Imagining myself in a dark room with a mirror in front of me and inside me is the world's most deadliest soul
ImagineDragons the only one who can take me into his mood!
Trent Reznor’s disposed preferred brand of diet cola made a song.  Maybe not how we want to use our research CRISPR dollars.
I fuck with this, it's, different in a good way
I always wish can scream like Dan does. It's hopeless, but I'm terribly hopeful
it's not me
Ahhaaa I love thisss
Apoyando el arte del rock
Gracias por estas dos canciones!!! <3
Gents that is epic
🇧🇷♥️
Imagine Dragons ♥️They don't make mistakes
Why people arent talking about what he says in the second verse? Man..
Aradığın Türkçe yorum.
好讚~
my favorite ♥️
I don't think so that this song is in Spanish
Straigt up tailor made for fighting sport promo
Adding this to my “Angry Boi” playlist in hopes I’m not this mad, but a time may come 😯👌🏼 that is firreee thiooo
The film like to be an old supernatural case documentry...
Melon sent me here
So Follow You is simple pop I have no issue with that. Simple music for simple people. Cutthroat is weird. It sounds like the band's best Nine Inch Nails impression. I didn't like that it comes right after Follow You. The shift was really jarring. Overall I will say that cutthroat is creative and different even if it doesn't sound amazing. Lyrically it's Imagine Dragons so nothing too special.  Looking forward to the album especially if some of the stuff is as creative and out there as Cutthroat
Omgggg  THIS IS AMAZING! I MISSED U GUYS 😍😍😍🥰
Not gonna lie you guys have made better songs. :/
finally a good song
Terrible lie by Nine inch nails vine at the beginning
If you forget that Imagine Dragons is supposed to be a rock band, this is actually a really decent track.
The first 30secs really sounded like cradles🤨✌️😬
Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii estan de vuelta¡¡¡¡¡¡ siiiiiiiiiii
perfect villain song
💚💛💙
I may be a little stupid, but at least I don’t listen to Imagine Dragons  unironically
Is is so bad!! 🤣🤣
Future WWE Hell in a Cell Theme Song
🔥🔥🔥 I don't know how many times I have already repeated it... feels like I'm a bit obsessed with it))
Its the "try me" then that beat drops..I will always be a fan...I felt this song..cutthroat all 2021
Someone please help what genre is this because I'm straight up in love?? Please recommend songs that are similar to this because hooooly shit
I need this album to release yesterday
Wow I loved the song
DAAANG THIS SONG IS CRAZY GOOD
Probably shouldn't be listening to this song while I've got a headache, 'cause now I've got Dan Reynolds screaming "TRY MEEEEE" stuck in my head as well, while my skull is slowly shrinking and crushing my brain... Worth it, so nice to get a song like this from ID, 'cause I feel they've been leaning more to the pop side of music, which is fine, they've made some great songs, but I do feel like some of their songs have felt kinda generic, but this is a really nice breath of fresh air, which sounds weird saying from what I've just listened to. Anyway, I'mma go lie down.
eu to assim 😲😲😲😲
THIS IS WILD!!!!
Ohhh-kay! #WeSeeYou #Wolf 🦉😜
Dan Reynolds sings like a Brian Johnson of AC/DC. It's amazing. Epic Song! 🔥
estan enfermos
Wooooow aciidddd
WOW
Yeees Dan is screaming Love that
Firstly, this is much better than Follow You. FY is just a normal pop rock song - nothing special. Cutthroat is just something unique and haven’t heard from ID in a while. Secondly, I can put my finger at exactly one, but it sounds similar (in anger, screaming and style) to a past song. Machine, Battle Cry and some songs from Night Vision come to mind
I don't like it....  I'm sorry....
يعني اخطر من غسان مطر
This is so cutthroat
Que los gringos sientan que es no entender los comentarios.
Mano essa musica é top❤❤
This gives grandson vibes
very strange
This sounds like absolute shit lmao how can anyone defend this? 😂😂😂
Me: Mum, can we have Nine Inch Nail? Mum: We have N.I.N at home. N.I.N at home:
Yes! Imagine Dragons' back on business! 🤩😁😍
First time I listen to it: sounds cool                  Second time: love it                      Third time: GODLY
the song lost my interest at 0:50 because it just keeps repeating the same thing over and over for the rest of the song i mean, it comes back at the next verse but then it's some more repeated screaming
Caraca bixo '-'
am i the only one who gets some kendrick lamar humble vibes from this song
Its perfect 💝
😈
i dont know what i've just heard.. i dont know how to feel.
Alguien de los  presentes sabe hablar español o que sea bilingue o soy el unico (apenas estoy aprendiendo el idioma de los gringos) XD
Simplemente wwooww!!!  Amazing!!!
Imagine dragons have returnet
Wellbutrin: dopamine-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor Serotonin: spelled wrong Me: Does this guy even depression?
mds, como eu amo essa banda,  É BRASILLLLLLLLL 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Damn....
Que pasa con los dislike? Todo bien en casita????
This has March Madness theme to it........ Go Coogs🤘
No, what happened to imagine dragons
⚡🔥
Bitchhhhhhhh Is wonderfulllllllllll
So bands in 2020 going into 2021 learned what🤷‍♂️ having a side b matters.
Covid 20's theme
If things go terrible in 2021 too, this can be a strong contender to become the opening song for 2022.
Who's stolen my boys password?please give it back and stop playing.
Imagine this song during a Imagine Dragons concert. Everybody will go crazy haha. Can't wait to experience that (:
ASH?!
:)
Trash
Imagine Dragons >>
How lucky you all😣 you all live in USA and EU🤐
IDK?'_'
follow you is better
This is the worst thing I’ve ever heard.  I almost cried. It’s that terrible.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Adorooo
im so EXCITED for this album!!!
I like this song ✌️☠️
🔥🔥🔥🔥 listening from broomfield Colorado
This is so insane
On repeat since launched 🎶
Because of stuff like that Imagine Dragons is more than just a mainstream band. Masterpiece!
Wonder how ur voice is alive....
Yes I’ll die imagine dragons live so you can make more songs! Even if I’m dead I’ll love your songs.
Their best music are songs not about relationships. Imo
💥🔥
......?
Temazoooo
Nine inch nails-ish!❤️
You came back!
future bass?
Caçando brasileiros com bom gosto musical?!🔥
do people actually find this good ???
Im big fan of Imagine Dragons but to be honest, I dont really feel this song
Another hit💯
É incrível a capacidade desse homem de só fazer músicas boas
masterpiece
BOM DEMAIS
It’s like if twenty one pilots, sub urban and the score had a baby  I just wanna hear imagine dragons rap on a beat like this 😬❄️❄️
chevere :D!
THIS SHOULD BE GO VIRAL
0:42 😂😂
I love when the hi hats come in (2:10)
Try me is super funny🤣🤣🤣
Doctor : you have 2 minutes to live Me : let me hear imagine dragons cutthroat Doctor : it 2 minutes 50 second God : it's ok
"Eu sou tão incompreendido, mas vivo para isso,  Meu dinheiro é bom, e vim para ganhar,  Então suba, e eu prometo a você,  Só um de nós vai sair dessa vivo e não é você"   Mas uma Obra de Arte para meus ouvidos O ritmo com cada batida dessa música é incrível.
They opened video after months😂😂😂
Getting The AC/DC Vibes !!
This is really interesting. I'd love to hear singer in a Post-Hardcore band.
mi da un botto di carica
IO AMO STA CANZONE AIUTO
Trent Reznor just got Forest Whitaker eye
It's so goodddd , i was goosebump
I like this sound....-:)!!!😉Imagine Dragons are back-:)!!! Yeahhh
Gosh, I just love this song. It's so different then the other Imagine Dragons' songs, It's just so bizzare and peculiar, but I feel like It'll be kinda forgotten, just like "Bullet in a gun" - because It's so different. And that's such a shame, 'cause this song just hits so different - I feel pure madness and rage in it. We haven't got a single ID song like this (maybe "Battle Cry" is something a bit similiar, but It's still something else). I feel like already It's in the shadow of "Follow You", but I personaly find this one so much better and more interesting. This song remindes me of combination of Imagine Dragons with Fall Out Boy, with a tiny bit of The Score - It's just so good. Maybe It won't be in my top 10 ID's songs, but I still find it very enterataining. Yeah, it also gives me old ID songs' vibes, mostly "Unseen"
👍👍👍👍
I was talking with a friend and we talked about in the Origins album we liked how Dan screamed in some of the bridges of songs and we were like "He should scream more"  *this song then exists*
2 days ago and 7.2k comments wow
-After all this time? -Always Guys,you're back...I just🥺💖
Imagine Dragons were always the band that got me through hard times. Now Ive got them and the wonderful grace vanderwaal and yeah I know it sounds weird but those "two" Music-genius-persons are all I want to listen to. Thanks for everything you do!❤🔥
amazed, how to get such confident?
Epic!!🔥
I bet Dan had a sore throat
Heyy imagine dragon:)))vietnamese❤️❤️👉👈
❤️
Вы лучшие
Imagine dragons always best 😍
Remember when a random YouTube channel premiered a leaked Imagine Dragons song and it was gone the next day like nothing happened? Yeah, that was fun 😎
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Your back finally :D
🔥🔥🔥
I dont know why but this song give me AOT vibe.
So sad ;  Imagine dragons can't even make a single bad song.
Gonna take some effort to make a worse song than this in 2021 jeez
Good music, but the videos are freemasonic and satanic again yikes
Anyone hearing this song and "Follow You " together . Trust me try it together , it vibes like anything
Enjoy what's left of your life
AC/DC 2021
Well shxt fam ain't singing this oh god i mean like all that "cutthroat" lines man jesus
Not corona virus but us 👌
Underrated song
Good old and rare music of Imagine Dragons
2 songs in a day . Whoohoo!
1:50 mosquitoes flying near my ear
NIN feel
I love it
This is amazing.
Do more songs with cry!!!
Very different from the other Imagine Dragon songs, kinda reminds me of the rolling stones.
The song's superb an' all, but I dunno, it doesn't sound like 'Natural' and 'Believer' type o' Imagine Dragons... Well I jus' guess that it's jus' 'nother side o' them...
YALL ARE BACK IM SO FREAKING HAPPY
Nice work again :)
Wpw
these new songs sounds so different from everything they made earlier
Feelin like machine and natural
Is this some kind april joke, that is little bit out of date? Please....
Gotta admit, this song isn't really my thing. But I'm really excitet that they're experimenting so much!! This is going to be a really interesting album.
Монгол хүн байна уу?
dan screaming like this is surprisingly scary
Dan's scream is satisfying as hell
Reminds me of 9 inch nails
so this some kinda metal huh
Don't get me wrong I love your music but on this one it kinda sounds like you rushed it and it's not your best... sorry🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
I like this song even more than some of the other songs that they made.
“I’ve been making my Gethsemane Since I was young my ancestry Was marching martyrdom across the the Radadadadumbla plains plains of Utah I can’t lie I’ve been played By powerful people who get their way But I in time will climb my mountain I in time will rise again  Huh, I wonder who that’s directed towards?
📢
I feel this song would be the best ost  for a horror movie
A la madre, que buen contraste con la cancion anterior xd, me gusto mucho
They went from Maroon 5 to Mettalica but tbh I like the new style they’re experimenting with
This is real music
amazing,pretty powerful,love it!!!
Wth was this video very weired
Awards to the best music band
I can already see the AMV creators coming to take another song
Heavy Nine Inch Nails vibes
Love💟
This is the kind of songs you hate at first but then it grows on you
Well this is horrible
wut
Esperei tanto pela volta de vcs ❤🇧🇷
Badass
Dan to his voice: Only one of us gon' live and it's not you.
what did i just see....................................................
Finally finallyyyyyyyyyy
The ultimate baseball walkup song.
What the actual fuck? No, really, this fucking sucks
A perfect song for a villain, honestly think this specifically would fit Joaquin's Joker
😨😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😂😂😂i'm happy 😱😂😂😂
Who's here before a million view.!!??? ❤️
Por ustedes le hecho ganas a la escuela ❤️❤️
No entendí
wowwwwwwowoooooooooowwwwwwwwwwowoooooowwwwwwwwww
Esto fácil pudo estar en Smoke and Mirrors.
rip my throat
🖤
This has been done a million times better by bands like Zeal and Ardor. Why would anyone listen to this?
me gusto la canción, es un poco tenebrosa jaja y la voz de dan es tan desgarradora. una canción muy experimental, quedaría muy bien  como soundtrack en algo de terror
The amazing screaming Dan Reynolds does reminds me of I'm So Sorry vibes.
1:33 Thats me at the volleyball screaming on the other team
Imagine Dragons will always and forever be my FAVORITE band🤸🏾‍♀️🙌🏾❤💜
I dig it. It reminds me of vibes from their second album. Their 1st and second albums are by far my favorite works they have done! Love the experimental alternative sound! 👏
💃🤘😁
YOOOOOOOOO!!! I WASN'T READY!!!! THIS IS FIRE!!!!!!
Hi
This is gonna be used in a SAD-ist animatic
Again I am so happy your making videos again
Ooh, cool song.
This song reminded me of Chester, Linkin Park.
OMG, THIS IS AMAZING ❤️😱
Wow! ❤️
Good video like
I NEED TO HEAR THIS LIVE SO FUCKING MUCH
Nine Inch Nails
For this song alone I am now a fan. Sincerely a guy who likes heavy
Vaya que onda con este nuevo estilo, suena brutal
YOU CANT FIGHT THE FRIC... oh , i mean ONLY ONE OF US !
¿Cómo me tatuó esta canción? Ahh
Os cara sao foda msm
It sounds good, I like it
I like follow you a lot more and hope they push that instead of this
" فكرة انك تحبي واحد ميقدرش يشوفك زعلانه دي بالدنيا كلها ". ♥💍  حتي لو غلطانه مجرد ما يحس ان دموعك هتنزل يصالحك..  اللي بيعترف بغلطه وبيقول اسف.. اللي وقت زعلك يعمل المستحيل عشان يفرحك.. اللي وقت تعبك يخطفك من الدنيا.. اللي يدخل من الباب ويكلم اهلك ، ويخاف عليكي من الهوا..  اللي وقت متميلي تلاقيه ساندك.. اللي تلاقيه وقت الجد هزار ، و وقت الهزار هزار بردو ♥  " دا مش بيعملوا غير الراجل وبس "❤🔐
I’m sorry Dan, I respect you guys for trying something new but my ears are BLEEDING.
With all due respect, what the fuck?
Me alegra ver tantos comentarios en español
Amazing 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Tô numa felicidade desgraçada aqui Mano, logo duas músicas de uma vez, meu deus.... Q sonho realizado. 🖤🖤🖤🖤🔥

Too cool....
So cathartic.
😍😎 Coolllll
Ecco, dopo San Remo, i mitici Empire of the sun si sono sentiti in dovere di rispondere a Colapesce e Dimartino
YES YES YES YES!!!!!!
TRY ME
i feel like this songs are like oposites, like follow u is water nd this is the fire  follow u is the peace nd this is the warth, follow u is the heaven and this is hell, nd that makes this album perfect
as long as I like imagine dragons's music this song is HURTING MY EARS SO MUCH !!! :(
cara de resident evil
Nobody:  Me automatically associating this with Dream SMP
His voice has changed sounds damaged vocal cords
🖤🖤🖤🔥
I dont know why, but i like Cutthroat most than follow u. Obviosly two songs are precious!
Every song you guys come up with it’s amazing!!! I feel it in my bones!! 😆😆
This band is awesome. They truly keep showing they can do anything. For those of you who feel the need to give it a thumbs down instead of just watching and scrolling by you have no idea about being an artist. Artists need to express themselves and if you love their body of work you shouldn't dis them for a song you aren't "into" so to speak. They aren't there to fit into your judgy little pockets. You could look at them more like people. Buy their songs  instead of getting them free on Spotify. The industry is suffering..the least you could do is not give them a thumbs down. Great job @ImagineDragons ❤
Not what i was expecting whatsoever
Hold up there's two?
Lover!♥️
Bro is this my birthday because 2 songs on a random Friday? Best Friday ever :D
When imagine dragons here's a nine inch nails song
Não tem um dragão no clip
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amooooooo ❤️❤️❤️❤️♥️
This is prime ufc walk out music
Like músic dan
living your life cutthroat natural@
Mds esse album promete socorroooo
INSANE
Happy Sunday 💝♥️
Wow, this sounds bad.
I’ll not listen it every day but I fuc*ing love this group and the lyrics of this one means so much about them it’s perfect
For anyone curious: Dan reynolds has said in an interview that This new album is gonna have 2 sides to it, the follow you kinda side which is uplifting pop and cutthroat the more chaotic side of the record and will have 2 different themes. Wait thats called structure....
Uffff Seriously, what a great thing. I loved it ❤️✨
Imagine dragons critics: Imagine dragons mostly always sound the same  Imagine dragons: Ok heres cutthroat that experiments and is somthing new Critics: What the fuck this is differnet then what they have made before   Point being: You shouldnt need a reviewer to say somthings good for you to get enjoyment, if you like it, then keep on likeing it, be yourself <3 PS THIS SONG SLAPS
damn, those vocals are insane
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I love the new songs ! 🎧🧡
👌👌👌Hello from Lithuania!! What amazing performance !! Thank you for that!!👏👏👏
I can feel it in my bones...
anD i be rising to the top of the Battle anD only one of the races will stanD onto of a pile of DeaD BoDies victoriously  anD i will always taste victory
true i always make it out alive anD them mechanical clones will never make it out alive anD if cutting the throat will kill them mechanical clones then anything i will Do to kill the roBotic clones
LOVE IT, been playing it over and over.  Would be great beginning to a super hero movie.   ❤
Видео вызывает какую-то смутную тревогу
this song makes me feel like a baddass.
Lyrics is not so good hope it would be better if out as video.
Try Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!
Dioooooos!!!!!!! Que puta locura!!!! que voz!!!!! Follow you enterneció mi corazón pero Cutthroat estremeció cada celula de mi cuerpo. Esta banda hace arte pura y nadie lo puede negar.
Me listening to this at 0.5 speed from 2:09: Satan you forgot your song here
Is this about leaving the LDS church??
This song should be on smoke & mirrors
Bruh you tryna be Trent Reznor 😂😂😂👌🔥🔥
😂😂😂😂😂😂 🗑
how is it still not on trending urgh
En la calle voy escuchando esta canción y me intentan robar les mando un madrazo
Clearly Pac-Man inspired the intro..
❤️ The best
Verga esto suena genial!
❤️
I didn't like this song when i heard it first time but now i love it
This remembers me of the first music they used to do before they become so popular. It's the the type of song that you must hear it two or three times before getting into the depth of it and then, only then, you get to appreciate it and even love it.
I prefer the original by Blessthefall.
Imagine Dragons literally can't make a bad song another Banger
The amount of mormon symbolism and references!!!!!!! I’m shocked! He’s finally calling them out wow
Billie Imagine Eilish Dragons
Imagine dragons meets nine inch nails
GOOOOODDDDD
واقعا آهنگ قشنگیه
Not so much a song as a War Chant.
I love amagean dragons
The best❤️🔥🔥🔥
I like your songs such as: "Whatever it takes", "Warriors", "Demons", "Radioactive", "Believer". I don't know English and listened to them, and when I translated them into the language that I understand, I was very surprised that I was listening to my favorite songs from my favorite band that describe me and my life. 3 years in depression and life is getting worse and worse, I have no desire, let alone the strength to live, but faith in the best stops me from suicide.   I changed my whole life, because I almost killed her, and at the end of everything ...
Thx for uploading videos
Rolling Stone said “Cutthroat” is, by far, the edgiest single of the band’s career. This is edgy? It's so lacking in melody, and other musical structures, it barely qualifies as song, let alone one that's edgy. Meh. I'll pass.
It's good to be back 😌
Holy Crack!!!!   I am OBSESSED!  I absolutely love the meaning of this song (see below; assuming that explanation is real).
Smoke and mirrors theme i love this reminds us that they are rock gods !!!
Muito foda pqp, que maravilhaaa
OMG! YOU CAME BACK
this gives me machine vibes and i love it
The vocals just wow
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO WHAT IS THISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSs
Follow You= Alternative Cutthroat= Hard Rock
I don't know if I should laugh or cry...
Everything they do is gold
I want to see an MMA fighter walk out to this!! Only one of us is gonna make it out alive and it's not you!!
Просто огонь
Mozilla Hubs?! xd
Wow! This song is fu*king crazy!
💘💘💘
I just found this gem 😎
Papá: hijo apaga esa bocina Hijo: pero por qué papá?): Papá: tenémos uno más potente allá abajo...
Что за жук в клипе?
This is just wonderful!!!!
observation from my partner- sounds like they're tying to be Nine Inch Nails mixed with System of a Down PG musical theatre
This is amazing!!!
Friction vibe?
I see someone in the band isn't in the best of moods again
Wait, did Imagine Dragons just release something interesting and not just pure radio pop? I've been waiting for this since Smoke + Mirrors!
Guys imagine them performing this live. Epic.
I LOVE THIS
He sounds like he just smoked 20 packs of cigarettes
Buenísimo, mi banda favorita.
When I listen to the song I feel getting a lot of energy in me!!!  So powerful like anything before.
This song is shitty
Eren Yeager’s theme.
Disappointed
I don't like this song daaa...
Ahhhhhh que hermoso!!!!
I love Imagine Dragons because every song is so different from all the others
This song is a dare to any cover out there.
Love this.
Comeback to beginning
Я как фанат Драконов скажу, что это интересно смотрится и слушается😁
New music 😁 I'm here for it! Imagine 🐉 ✨🤩
It's really 🔥lit asf. They have tried something new and it's unique ,i am damn sure this would become famous
Sounds like an Evil theme in Pokemon !
Ah yes. More Bastille/early Linkin Park vibes somehow...
This sounds like what a dude with tonsillitis would make after listening to 'Blackout' by Linkin Park for the first time
🔥🔥🔥🔥👏🏾👌
This shit slaps......hard.
❣
oh no dan has the joker syndrome!! 🤒☹🥺😦😫
i saw some people saying "this song is not my style but good" but im saying THIS SONG IS WHAT I LOVE DANG WHOLESOME
At last a hard core ish song!!! AMAZING
My mom once asked if he was black, and I couldn't see it, but I kinda see where she's coming from now, especially in the chorus
this that serial killer banger
I wholeheartedly don't understand why people dislike this song. I personally really like it; granted I enjoy this specific style of music immensely. It's a good song with lyrics that have a very real meaning to Dan. And the people asking why this song is in a different style or demanding they not do music like this? You don't own them, they can do with their music how they wish. An artist is allowed to experiment and do as they please.  When they focused on the pop genre they were laughed at for not being alternative but now that this song is out you want them to not make in this style? Make a decision, people.
Better. But still I think you’re going into the wrong direction
My take: It's about his (and many peoples!) battle with depression and mental health struggle, he's fighting demons and he's saying HE will WIN!  I appreciate Dan and Imagine Dragons because mental health is many times misunderstood as the lyrics say yet it's so vitally important to seek the help one needs. To all those that need to hear it YOU'RE NOT ALONE in the battle you're more important than you realize. Thank you Dan and Imagine Dragons!
Awesome ❤
역시쩔어 대단해
https://youtu.be/XqXrKQinGbM
Cadê os Brasileiros🇧🇷 Ouvindo essa maravilha 😍😍
Erram nunca 🇧🇷
Great song for the beginning, during a race!
Love it !!! ❤
Imagine dragons have ruined themselves by not sticking to how there music was back in the day with night visions. It’s sad because they were great.
Two words - BEST SONG -
I'm usually not a huge imagine dragons fan, but a friend showed me this song and I can't say how much I love it!!
the piano notes have the melody of the GTA San Andreas theme! kinda
Amazing
I wanted to listen to it and i was like mmm mabey but then when I was i was like FRICK YA THIS IS AWSOOMMMMEEEE
Me alegra verlos de vuelta, soy feliz por volver a oír algo nuevo. Espero que no se les ocurra separase otra vez🤔🤣
mükemmel yani mükemmel bir grupsunuz baya iyisiniz baya yani aha ingilizce ıs actıvıted we love you sanırım ingilizce bildiğim en uzun cümle bu : ) hayk mayk ne güzel yorumdu yorumuma lıke atarmısınız hani mal youtuberlar söyler ya hah ondan işte
❤
finally we have new music and its amazing
ILOVEIT
Isso ta perfeito demais 👌❤❤ Perfect. ♡
Uuuuu this is so coollll 🤩🔥🔥🔥
Better than Follow You ))))
Whatever meaning this lyrics has, it doesn't justify how bad this song is at all. You can make a different style, you can improve from your previous works...but screaming randomly it's just a downgrade.
Dude this is so GOOD
Yo, this epic!
Holy shit! Caught me off guard but I LOVE the style change
What kind of people hate Imagine Dragons? Murderers? pedophiles? what will they do next? who hates imagine Dragons ?!
CRAZY 😍
He really cut his throat with his vocals.
Love
0:12
A real masterpiece. After long time some good music!
Love it!!
At 1:48 when you try to sleep but the mosquitoes     Yo bro, I'm sing a song
I was surprised when I watched this, I had to double check the uploader.....
I dońt good speak English . It is perfect 🥺
this song will be good to the intro of new saw movie
0:19 I‘m a bit confused. Isn’t it spelled “serotonin” (in the lyric video, it’s spelled “seratonin”)?
Damn, they have like a whole new style        i freakin love it
Damn i feel like this could make a horror movie
❤️
If I'm so sorry, Digital and Machine had a son.
I really want to listen to this live ❤
doesn't sound like that iconic imagine dragons sound
Another Imagine Dragons triumph! Love it !
Wow suena bien
Lo mejor que tiene esta canción es el estribillo.
Finally, that trilogy, which was promised by Imagine Dragons, is going to complete
D A M N
This is ok, but "follow you" is top
Someone found the definition of insanity.
Me playing Cutthroat  FBI open up 😂😂
When the world needed them most... They came back 🥰🥰
cool
Radadadada dumbla
This should definitely be in Godzilla v Kong
The quiet kid walking around the school with this at full volume in headphones
This song better be in a movie by the next year     ...I’m waiting
💯
in my opinion this is epic- i think people are rlly stupid because when imagine dragons was more pop based, they were just made fun of and dissed for not being alternative and now that they have experimented a bit more, people are hating on it for being different. like make up ur mind,
Yay finally there back!!
https://youtu.be/IjhyivNIFYo
Zeal and Ardor > Imagine Dragons
I LOVE SO MUCH THE SONG !!!
Old talon mains
*It's time to repent and seek JESUS* .He gave his life, and suffered the wrath of the Father in the cross, to save you from a eternal hell. For God loves you, but the sin must be punished. On the third day He raised from the death, showing to the world that He is God. So stop sinning and clean your life. He returns soon to judge and destroy the sinners. *Read the Bible.* *THE END IS NEAR.*
Imagine this song with dragon
Wow. I'm shocked! I love it!
I feel like this song sounds a bit like Billie Eilish 😳
I love it
Legendary :)
Is it just me or does this gives you Hamilton vibes? like its amazing like holy crap-
As experimental rock you disapointed. As dark Hip-hopish track you disappointed. As Pop you disappointed. Those vocals sound like old guy trying sing in hardcore band, even though he has no talent nor physical ability, Also, this ain´t Rick Rubin´s finest work. 0,5/10
Terrible
Is it the new Opening of attack on titan ?
The screaming is trash
Billie abla tarzı
It is like imagine dragons turned it into metal for a bit
Wow
So so good song but not best song from imagine dragons.We want more new song. Because after all you made me a believer
I loove  imagine dragons  but I think imagine dragons  just made there    first trash  song  and that's cutthroat
They are back?!?!
cutthroat
It feels like night vision
my god, this is horrible. Split up again  man
The power 🔥🔥👍
The lyrics said I've been played
The lyrics is just pike he sepl his soul to the devil
This vibe feels like korn.........idk.....
Holy shit this is bad Six Feet Under bad
idk why people hate this song i mean its lyrics are soo damn powerful just like Dan's vocals. just try delving the meaning of the song deeper and you'll definitely love it. well maybe Dan expected this. he even said it in the lyrics " i'm so misunderstood, but i lived for this"
I'm shook!!!
ajută omul acela să fie ciudat🥺
Rare
Vremo
OMG THATS GOLD!!!!!
Is this the new Linkin park??
Violent
It feels like a part of me comes back
Rubbish!
Barns Courtney’s ep released last July and now this let’s go
Что-то в Стиле 21пилотс збс нове звучание
Lyrics: I've been waiting patiently I built this tower quietly And when my well of Wellbutrin is Running dry of serotonin I can say things I don't mean Or maybe it's the truth in me I feel it building, bubbling up My tick tick time is up  I'm so misunderstood, but I live for this My money's good, and I came to win So step on up, and I promise you Only one of us gone' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat) Only one of us Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat) Only one of us Only one of us gon' make it out alive  I've been making my Gethsemane Since I was young my ancestry Was marching martyrdom across the Radadadadumbla plains of Utah I can't lie, I've been played By powerful people who get their way But I in time will climb my mountain I in time will rise  I'm so misunderstood, but I live for this My money's good, and I came to win So step on up, and I promise you Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat) Only one of us Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat) Only one of us Only one of us gon' make it out alive  Try me Try me Cutthroat Only one of us Only one of us Not you Only one of us Only one of us Only one of us...  (Cutthroat) (Cutthroat) (Cutthroat) (Cutthroat)
giving me thriller vibe
Amooooo❤
I loved machine and i love the same vibe from this
Guys I just found a new alarm ringtone!
Dang. This is almost satanic sounding.
Sooo good
Well done Imagine Dragons ❤️ I'm waiting for a new 🥺
Somehow my soul just vomited hearing  this
Perfect song for AOT AMV..
Perfection is impos..  Imagine dragons:exist Me 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽lord has blessed us with the music gods
You know I last heard cutthroat word in the song NATURAL😌
Briinnngggg itttt oonnnnnn!
Great music
This song could not have a different title 🤣👏👏
Not exactly a song you can sing along to lol!  Bit of a Firestarter vibe near the end. Quite different from Radioactive.
I usually avoid screaming songs because they're just not my thing, but I FREAKING LOVE THIS SONG!
Is this related to the new musical Treason that was released this week??? Cuz it fits so well, lyrics, images, and all!!
last two players left in fortnite battle royale me:only one of us gonna make it out alive and it not you me:DIE!
I didn't expect that. But it's so good. We need to wake up people.
Please someone respond to this, do we know when the next album comes out?
Too tough for your group
Love the rawness of the two new official videos! “Cutthroat” could be a walk in song for an MMA fighter! Can’t wait for the rest of the album! Thanks again Dan and ID! Love you guys!
i get repoman the genetic opera vibes
Awesome thanks for the song Dan
Bad ass!  “Cutthroat” made my heat tingle!  Similar to natural in theme. Love it! Thanks Dan and ID!!
This is laughably bad lmao
I LOVE UOR SOMGS THERE SO GOOD
Who agrees this would SLAP with the hamilton play
2021 the year believer is reborn
IT IS NOT YOU  !!
this somehow sounds like a blend of Natural and Machine.
Che manata!
Finally a song by them I actually like! Those guys were my favourite band in like 2013 but I couldn't bear to hear anything after smoke and mirrors. This one reminds me of the first eps' experimental stuff, hope there's more like it coming!
Love this new song!
this feels like a horror movie!!! Insaneee!! 🤘
👌🏻😭💘👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💖💖💖
Fire 🔥
POV: You searched for this.
i literally dont hv words
I always look for new from Imagine Dragon, Tommie Profit, Sam Tinnesz, The Phantom etc.
I'm going through a difficult time and this song is definitely going to be my emotional support.🔥🔥
I feel like the vocals are similar to One Step Closer
Наконец-то как долго ждал
I'm so happy right now
This song by imagine dragons is very different... And I LOVE it!!!
Not sure how much I like this new style compared to night visions and smoke + mirrors, but I still kinda like it
Love every song of you❤
😊 sooooo gooood
oooo a new song
Um, is everything alright Dan? You okay, bro?
Wow this song has metal vibes.
Man suddenly became Chester lol
If y'all are into this, you should DEFINITELY check out Blackout by Linkin Park.  It's similarly experimental and harsh and it's also just an insanely cool song.
"get up and leave"
Dios que temonnnnnn✨
imagine the dragons who wrote these lyrics !
Demasiado rock para las personas de algodón
TELL ME YOU'RE LEAVING THE CULT. PLEASE. WE'RE BEGGING. EXMO❤️
Балдёж 😍
Tiktok gonna have fun with this song
I personally like the weirdness of this song, but I'll just listen to it with headphones, it feels too weird to listen to it with speakers. It's very on your face, for that we have follow you.
Sensacional!!!
топ!
*SLOW IT DOWN!* .75
😎😎😎😎
Amazing
pov   ves a alguien que habla español como tu
My inner rock junkie is fuccing    q u a k i n g.
After listening to it I had to drink a hot lemon tea with honey
Again, an amazin song!!!
🌟
Воображаемые драконы живы!  Ну или же имаджин драгонс
American Horror Stories
Imagine dragons the biggest band of the entire world and who disagree is lying
Yeah, Imagine Dragons ❤🔥
People say its hard to have a cat as a pet. Imagine Dragons
This song exist:   my mind imagining im in a movie as the pshycopathic villain:
ME VENGOO
This would make an awesome theme song for Deadly Class TV series
Cause you're a natural living your life cut throat...
I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS INSTRUMENTAL AT ALL AKDJDKKF AND THE VOCALS?!?!!?! Dan never stops amazing me omg this is so good! Currently my third fav song from Imagine Dragons (Nothing left to say and Bad liar aren't moving in that list tho) ❤
Lets see how many people from my country India listening this song 🇮🇳
who is here before 1 million views
💙💙💙💙💙
Imagine Dragons you are my favorite band of all time!!
Machine+i'm so sorry=  Lol
Ahhh yes. I too remember listening to this in March, 2021
Just imagine this LIVE 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anyone know what radadada dumbla means?
bellesa pura
Imagine dragons going down 👎  didn’t like it that much 🤦‍♂️  *The song is messy a l little  * The most important characteristic of imagine dragons songs was that it expresses the pressures of life and exhaustion  That’s exactly why people loved their songs because it touches their reality  But not this one 🚶🏻
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFh_cMAAJ5o
Yeah sorry I don’t like this one
una locuraaaa
I love you
Holy shit and I thought Origins was a bad album...this is a new level of bad
WHAT IS THIS
Damn
Hmm. Gotta say I don’t really like this one. I get that they were trying to go with the experimental vibe like with Digital, but the screaming just completely ruins the flow and rhythm of the song. It’s a shame, because the instrumentals are amazing and the non-chaotic parts actually sound really good.
E
Súper buena, son los Mejores
Cadê os brasileiros(a) de plantão?
Your amazing guys your my favorite band
Same plot as of Rocky-1, but might be a good movie. All the best
la piel de gallina bro...son unas bestias talentosas
I'TS amazing, with all the soul of imagine dragons. I really feel this
Que canción hermosa ptmrrrrr ojalá sacaran un álbum completo con esta energía y fuerza de voz
Please cut my throat instead and save me from this abomination
✨jazzy bops ✨
🔥🔥🔥!!!
Mais uma que vão ter que baixar 1 tom ao vivo.
ohh i like the dark vibes
Lo mejor de lo mejor 😍💆
What kind of "Muse song" is this???
https://youtu.be/oEYPQ46UBSQ
i hope dan's throat is doing just fine, that vocal's lit af
I didn't know they still made music...wth
Can you pls make songs having tones like 'believer' 'whatever it takes etc.' So that we can enjoy the song more.
God im loving this so much
They’ve done it again! They never fail to amaze me!
amazing
Wow, this is amazing
Forced and weird. I prefer follow you
Muito bom ver trabalho novo de vocês i Love It!
Bang Bang Bang 🔥🔥🔥
Somehow they always make songs that could have been good, really annoying.
Cool
Ottimo sound
Demonic but inspiring
Imagine dragons es lo mejor  ,arriba imagine dragons
Cutthroat>>>>>>>>>>>Follow You,  solo en heavynesssssss
This song is good but believer is clearly the best imagine Dragons song comment yours and like if you aggre
He broke out of the cult! The lyrics from a minute on feel like a pretty powerful condemnation of the Mormon Church. I love it!
Me recuerda a Smoke&Mirrors, al álbum en general. Una canción un poco más cruda.
So much dislike.. Good to hear a billie eilish with mâle voice..
give me big misunderstood villain vibe here and im livinggg for ittt
fire!!!!
UTAH EXMOS RAISE YOUR HANDS!!!!!!!🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
I didn't think they could get worse. I was wrong.
Como este álbum tiene una diferencia tan refrescante y increíble, estaba esperando por esto
oh   wow qué pros
imagine dragons choose violence people lol
"misunderstood but i live for this"
I will never be disappointed about the songs
This is the kind of music that suits perfect for a shooting part on Peaky Blinders
Truthfully, not that good, but what can I say. I’m basic.
Perfect.
POWERFUL! The lyrics, the music, the pictures! Insane! I needed this! Love you guys and I hope to see you soon :)
Not a huge fan of this one, it just doesn’t sound like a true Imagine Dragons song... but follow me is amazing!
no se dice Imagine Dragons,se dice...la mejor banda⚡️
69,108th like. Damn, I'm early to the party. I didn't like it on the first listen but leave it on loop for a while and goddamn it grows on you. Good job, guys, and welcome back!
I love this song😍😍
🔥
Dios!!! Dan dejando la garganta en cada verso de la canción es simplemente épico señores, muy feliz por su gran regreso 🖤
Again showed up the kind of imagine dragons' songs what i wanted. Warriors, radioactive, believer, natural and now plus this song cutthroat.
Smoke and mirrors ❤❤❤🔥
Has any one notice this and follow you are opposite emotions.
this does not sound good oh my it's so ridiculously messy
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
ohHHHHH me vengo
Casimiro não gostou não hein. Melhorem.
this is giving me a headache
When COVID-30 hits people are gonna be bumping to this:(
Todo él apoyo Ánimo y fuerza para todos 🙏
Another one this is good we have two more great songs man the boys are back at it again
Follow You é melhor mas tá bom
❤
I dont like very much srry
Wow, just  W O W. This is an awesome song. I love how this song is opposite of Follow You. It’s perfect. Absolutely perfect.
It's kinda funny that they uploaded this song with a whole different Vibe than "follow you" at the same time
QUÉEEEEE? Debo admitir que sí, sufrí escuchando esta canción, no es lo que esperaba después de haber escuchado “Follow You”, y el video es terrible, aparte yo no sé si Dan trata de hacer un tipo de… Screamo noise?, pero sea lo que sea, está horrible, y ya ni hablemos de la producción ni el instrumental…  por lo menos la otra canción es buena
Did not like this one. Sorry
Wow. They released two totally different songs! They surprise EVERYTIME.  But this is the first song that I am not sure how I feel about. I'm not used to Dan screaming.. and I'm also not much of a fan of screamo songs.   But they're still amazing and I am still a huge fan! Fan since way b4 Nightvisions came out! 🥰🥰
Cadê os brasileiros que curtem Imagine Dragons?
Thats beautiful. I don't know what else to say

WHAT I FEEL THIS HIT
I-I t-theres no words..
The first time I heard this I was like :eww Now I'm like: hell yeah
This is definitely a new path for Imagine Dragons but I absolutely love it. This is the music I live for
I believe in Imagine Dragons supremacy 🛐✨
the crawling bugs at the end give me anxiety ;-;
ok this is kinda sick ngl
wooooooo
Kinda weird. I like it
This guys are so good. This is good banger
I love the variety in Imagine Dragons. Never ceases to hype me up
I love you guys but really this is worse than yummy. Wtf, so disappointed as a fan of yours. :(
Here is my new favorite ❤😍
Listening to this song makes me feel alive aaa
The backtrack at 1.5 speed sounds like the Knight Rider main theme lol
Eeeeeeee!!!! 😍😍😍❤😍😍
*Among us players be like:*
já tenho uma nova música preferido
noW THIS IS *IT* THIS IS ART
it’s the raging TRY ME for me
Fácil podria ser un videoclip de la nueva película de resident evil, es bastante similar al diseño de colores que manejan👌
Kings!
I like the beat, but those vocals are horrible.
Nou baddd💕
So happy to hear you guys again!
*T E M A Z O*
Credo, que dlç
Simplesmente o desgosto para o rei do entretenimento. #TROPADOCAZÉ
Não me arrependo de nenhum segundo da minha vida se foi pra esperar isso, simplesmente perfeito.  Bruto e metálico e "i follow you" good vibes e melancólico, simplesmente perfeito🇧🇷❤
Love the rock screams
They never disapointed me
Y los de habla hispana donde están??
Pinche rolón
Meo é meio assustador e brisante!!! Adorei😁
O música perfeita zero defeitos, aquele negócio que você fez na voz em 1:19... NOSSA SAÍRAM TOTALMENTE DA CAIXA, A parte instrumental, o detalhes, ficou perfeito parabéns mesmo
I Love them
Oh my god
What a marter piece’s 🥴
What is the vocal range of this song?
this song sucks
Que boa canção
The people who disliked didn’t make it out alive
Only the true fans love this song
WWE gonna be pouncing on this song for Wrestlemania ASAP!
Esos vocals aaaa
Se la rifaron
Daaaaaamn
Is there anyone to come back to this artist to check and hoping if they are anymore good like old times. This is shit.
This is straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥
havent checked on these guy for 6 years now. sad to see that they make moneymakers instead of actual music nowadays. night visions and their first couple of EPs were neat though. oh well.
This song is different from the other songs they have made but I mean it’s good I just don’t really like the screaming of the voices.
The video is a little bit disturbing but the music is good, very good. I've missed Imagine Dragons and now I am feeling good :)
Happy Friday
💓¡VIDA!💓
amazing, did something very different from the usual, I loved the music, it reminded me of Billie Eilish’s vibe for a moment
dang I love imagine dragons
anyone german
This song and follow you were released at the same time to show an example of my two moods ❤.
Glass Animals vibes at the beginning! Love it!
This is sick! I dig it :)
Cutthroat feels like Smoke and Mirrors and Follow You like Origins
OMG this sounds so different than other albums
🤢🤮
*BRAZIL THE TOP 1*
North cyprus   Kuzey Kıbrıs’tan selamlar seni izliyorum
this was a lot better than the other one
es simplemente perfecto
Mám novou oblíbenou písničku ❤️
Damn. Two so different songs. This one is so... POWERFUL. Amazing!
que buena quedo esta baina
the wait was worth it :3
Not a fan of this one.
Some video game will sample this song.
My revenge theme song.
Where are my imagine dragons of 8 years ago? 🥺
Love imagine dragons but this song is what a 14 year old would listen to thinking they're tough
The people who don't like this song just don't understand the way it's mixed imo it's better than follow you
This song is fire
as someone else that has AS, i absolutely feel this song any time i forget my meds . . . gotta keep that flare going at all costs right my man XD
No words...😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
🖤
This song is straight fire I love it I love if this is the direction their taking with their music I'm here for it
Puta que pariu 😍👏🏻
I need a video of Dan recording vocals for this
Tris is Samy better than the other song tbh, strong s+m vibes
Did you like the impractical jokers on stage
Y’all there’s a rumor that Why Don’t We collabed with Imagine Dragons,  HAVE THEY CONFIRMED IT BECAUSE IF THEY RELEASE A SONG WITH THEM I AM GOING TO FREAK, THE LIMELIGHT IN ME IS GOING CRAZY AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 😱😱😱😱😱
This song fit saison 4 Eren's energy so much
I love this song, it's really good. It kinda gives me Billie Eilish vibes too.
BRAZIL 🇧🇷🇧🇷
I don’t know why this song is already getting hate, it’s great and unique for them... I’m glad they are trying new styles out and if this is the new style I like it!!
Imagine dragons né pae  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
The moment I have been waiting for the past 3 years.
Los amo ID gracias por su música 🎶 tan genial
Yeah welcome new music lol
Cómo extrañaba las canciones de imagine dragons, a pesar de escucharlos tanto. Está tremendo que sigan subiendo y subiendo temas nuevos
o b s e s s e d. sooooo in love with this ❤️❤️❤️
YES I CANT WAIT TO SEE WHAT THIS WILL LOOK LIKE ON STAGE
I imaged everithing, But imagine dragons doing "sperimental" music in a so disturbing way not, But they are imagine dragons, so it's wanderfoul anyway
The King Returns
Não tem UMA música de imagine dragons q eu n goste 💥perfect💥
Бля 48 место в тренде , в России нихуя себе , как и ожидалось балдёж

😲😱😱👏👏👏❤️
Ahhh😍, los amoo
Yay!
I love this song lol oof
🥺❤️🥺❤️🥺❤️
IM SO OBSESSED
No les pasa que ✨imagine Dragon's ✨
I may have just found another one of my favorite songs. I love this!
I am very happy for your return, I love you ♥️
Похоже на саундтрек какого-то кровавого боевика) Sounds like  bloody action movie soundtrack)
This has Resident Evil vibes to it and I love it
Wow love this song❤❤
this man's voice is heavenly..
Been waiting since 2018 and this is absolutely worth the wait
The best Im from Indonesian

Cооl

Super Canción
Seriously sounds a lot like Linkin Park
Son los mejores 😍😘
You needed more instruments
I love u guys ! ❤
Woooow the vocals on this one 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🖤
they should change imaginedragons to imaginelegends
I'm loving this, hoping for a whole album with this kind of vibe.
This song is for the underdogs. Never let anyone control you and tell you what you can and can’t do. If you want something bad enough and are willing to do whatever it takes to get it you can get it. Often times the word will tell you that something is impossible, the people who prove that the impossible is possible are the people with a cutthroat mentality.
❤️
Canzone molto particolare... ma bella🔝🔥
Sinceramente mi canción favorita, porque es demasiado buena...y diferente, super fuerte.

Imagine dragons please play this in nz
Holy crap this is actually garbage imagine dragons more like imagine draggin these nuts cross ya face
I love ImagineDragons
"TRYYYYY MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!"   Really awesome song, guys!!! Such a great message that surrounds it as well. Like other people in the comments are saying, there are definitely vibes of a bunch of songs like Machine, Smoke & Mirrors, Digital, Friction, and I'm So Sorry coming together in this one song. Truly amazing. Keep on being you, ImagineDragons! WE LOVE YOU FOR YOU! <3
I love it
Only true fans will understand and like this song
AMAZING!😍😍😍😍🤩❤❤❤❤❗❗❗
Это невероятно
my new fav song

After singing this song Dan Reynolds to his throat: "ONLY ONE OF US IS GONNA MAKE IT OUT ALIVE, AND ITS NOT YOU." His Throat said: "TRY MEE....."
This is just Nine Inch Nails but shit
👍✌
You spanish?
Disclaimer: no throats were harmed in the making of this video.
I love this side of imagine dragons 😭😭😭
OMG THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!
se eles sabem fazer isso pq eles fazem Next To Me da vida

After radioactive, the radiation poisoning set in, hence this song

Meh
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates ♦️
Imagine Dragons are back🔥🔥🔥
This make want to kill someone 🙃
"I can say things I don't mean, Or maybe it's the truth in me." 😣
Anyone else getting Foo Fighters vibes?
Los seguiré esperando, aún su reencuentro
OMG ♥️
aga kalk sarki
Only I feel Nine Inch Nails spirit in Imagine Dragons song ? OH SHIT that's so  good !
One of the best songs Imagine Dragons had done!
I prefer "follow you"
Listening to their new music feels like if you were really righ
Esto es tan superior, es increíble me encanta
well, it looks like the good songs are back ❤️
The best Friday of my life♥️
Me when Momoland has a new song: *Celebrates by listening to Imagine Dragons* Me when Blackpink has a new song: *Celebrates by listening to Imagine Dragons* Me when Twenty one Pilots has a new song: *Celebrates by listening to Imagine Dragons* Me when Maroon 5 has a new song: *Celebrates by listening to Imagine Dragons* Me when Imagine Dragons has a new song: *Literally has a party at my house*
❤️❤️
Sounds like this could be in watchmen or sin city movie
This is terrible..
inspired by amogus
It's epic
AMOOOOOOOOOO😍😍😍
Fuck. This is not by accident this 2 song you just shared with us
Yeeeeeessssss
This song makes me think it could be a theme song for a WWE PPV for some reason
😂
Caramba !!! Quem mais ai se arrepiou !!!

Follow you : makes me feel so in love and gives me hope. Cutthroat : makes me feel invincible and like I actually want to be alive.
Volvieron cuando el mundo mas los necesitaba.
Yes cut my throat daddy lmao
entre estes dois lados de longe Cutthroat me define mais
Oh, f*ck eee best!
The dislikes are the ones who didn’t make it out alive
ESTOY LLORANDO, VOLVIEROOONN
Polska jesteście?
If there will ever be a AMV made on cutthroat (Akudama Drive), this song perfectly fits him.   Also this song would be perfect for a WWE PPV, probably Hell In A Cell
Unfortunatelly, second part is shitty.
Oh shit
La leei en español y creo que tuvieron un problema por hay
Oh this is... I don’t know this feels like a rock song but with an imagine dragons touch, yeah that...
THEY FUCKING DID IT AGAIN
Is he singing or yelling 😂🤣
90's pop

Imagine dragons saving 2021🙏🏻
Only thing I can picture is a man standing in front of the people who were saying he ain't gon' make it in life and driving him crazy and all that gathered made a bit insane, but he proved'em all wrong and now he's holding a knife and singing out insanely that they ain't gon' make it and there's a fear I get - the man's not kidding
Amooooo ♡♥♡♡

very very goooooooooooooood. the best
👍
I'm getting strong I'm So Sorry, Gold, Friction and Digital vibes from this haha
COME TO BELARUS PLEASE
BELARUS LOVE YOU
better than ''follow you''
The most powerfull song from imagine dragons career after Natural
As soon as I woke up this morning I listened to this song for the very first time in my AirPods with full volume. Since the first couple seconds are so quiet, it SCARED me when the actual song started haha woke me up real quick
I'm getting Digital and I'm So sorry vibes and I'm here for it.
A very meaningful song!
juste thanks you
On freaking time!
My God this is awful
Going straight from Follow You to this.  "Shit just went from 0 to 100 real fucking quick!"
Follow You is a lot better than this I hope they lean towards that when making music instead of this
So. I'm listening to this from now on
O que esperar de Imagine Dragons? Perfeição como sempre
vocês nunca me decepcionam, que hinoooo
Damn, I've been through a hard time, and i feel like they talked to me and wrote a song about my thoughts 🥺
فخمه♥️
why am i getting Shingeki no Kyojin "My War" vibes?
Nice
SIIIIII LO MEJOR DE MI DIAAA ES EDCUCHAR ESTA OBRA DE ARTE
Me-sees the notification My brain- You have now seen the importantest thing in your life
Foda pra caralho!!
ARREPIEI TODA!
CARALHOOOO
Damn, это нечто.
I loved !!!!!!
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG..!!!!!!!!!
Imagine dragons después 5 años:Ya llegó por quien lloraban
This will be 🔥
I entered youtube for science..........
I've read through the comments and I do understand why people would have mixed feelings when listening to the song in that kind of particular emotion, I'm like that too tbh. I've known Imagine Dragons ever since my first year of high school, their music legit made me happy when they have released 'Night Visions'. It was amazing as, they had the vibes that I truly wanted in the pop/rock industry. But now after hearing those songs, I don't know if I should continue supporting them like this anymore. I will give the band another chance to impress me with something the fans will really like from the Night Visions and Evolve era, that actually does help in gaining a fan music base though imo.
Жутко. Жутко круто
Добро пожаловать в реки тик тока
🔥🔥🔥
Oh my god, speechless again
👁👄👁
After listening this I can feel my throat
magnificence
Very cool🔥🔥🔥
WOW!! HOW MEANINGFUL AND MOTIVATING!! I LOVE THIS!!
Volvieron :")
reminds me of 90s industrial
Welcome guys!  We miss you so much
woww
it's too beautiful it's so amazing <3
A little bit of N.I.N influence?
The best song in the world, i love them
Pinche cancion espectacular alv
This is new
Jajajaja tan contrastante con "Follow You" jajaja Sí, muy a lo ID
Música foda     #Brasil
New imagine dragons is what I needed 🥺
Poetic! •^^•
I love them 😍😍😍
Best birthday presend ever!
Las canciones están tan bellas como el día en que se fueron
Poético! •^^•
FUUUUUUCCCCKK This song is on fireeee. Love this band so much.
Can't wait to hear this live🤗
OMG.  Did the Dragons catch the Cina-virus or what ?  🤮
Alfin regresaron
AAaa volvieronnn
I like this heavier sound ID is going for here. Kinda reminds me of Smoke + Mirrors
Surprising. That’s the word
I sent this to my daughter who is battling inside over her Mormon beliefs, the world, human love and her own heart❤ THIS song is exactly why I love Imagine Dragons. They can reach into the souls of the youth and feel with them. 💗
I don’t know how i feel about this song 🙃.
Nmms, esta bien vrgs!!!
1 cancion mas 1 vida mas
Song is not that good. The other song Follow you is way better. Also I HATE the video for this
MEU DEUS QUE SAUDADE
A LENDA VOLTOU
THIS IS LIT
MEU DEUS ELES NÃO ERRAM NUNCA
Has a dark vibe and i guess it's pulling me in.. Great work
This is so unusal but i love it
I'm so happy that they're trying new styles, presenting new styles, new aspects of themselves. Love it.
❤️
These two songs are both different from each other, I love it
Bija vērts gaidīt
Everything else besides the lyrics entices me.. I just think the structure wasn't really good like Believer or Natural
Efectivamente esto es arteeee✨❤️😔
Definitely not what I was expecting from Imagine Dragons considering their last album, reminds me of songs like Digital and Machine which were really diverse for them, I wonder if they’ll be going down this path music-wise in the future
Mrrrrrrrr O_O
Imagine dragons never disappoints us!!! Love it
Simplesmente ❤
Es un poeta ;)  Rock 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
Perfect!!!!
YESSSSSSSSS YESSS YESSSS YESSS YESSSS YESSS
It´s been a lot since the dragons released new music I missed you guys
Imagine DraGODS
Love it 🔥
Wow ♪ \(^ω^\ )
This is really bad
вау, мы рады наконец-то  слушать ваши шедевры! спасибо!
I dont know if this is better than believer
Mn.. perfeeeeeitooh
ahhhhhhhhhhhhh mis dragoncitos estan de regreso esta cancion esta super.
Viva imagine dragons
Ab banegana Friday dhaasu🤘🤘🤘
HI DAN
Memento Mori
Le di Like antes de la canción sabía que sería fantástico
They really don't know how much make me happy✨✨✨✨
* Imagine Dragons releases a rock song in 2015*   Everyone: 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍  * Imagine Dragons releases a rock song in 2021 *  People who met the band in 2019:😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡  Haha how i miss this Imagine Dragons❤
Wtf ... if I wanted listen to heavy metal I would’ve clicked on a Iron Maiden video ... smh 👎👎
Cutthroat...cutthroat damn i'm forget from which song that lyrics from
PERFEIÇÃO
Ya habia perdido la esperanza de un nuevo tema pero ya aprendi que nunca con imagine dragons
I have been waiting for new songs for some time to come
This makes sense because follow you had butterflies hatching and flowers blooming so that was about a new beginning and this has dead bugs and dead things so I think the lyric videos are connected with life and death
song of the year
Espero saquen la de enemy
Tengo ganas de bailar un cumbión bien loco.
After splitting with my wife. I fell into a hole (though we still get on.) Parts of this speak to me about saving my self without changing. This song has saved my soul
Good
This song rocks.❤️
A real masterpiece!
Verse 1] I've been waiting patiently I built this tower quietly And when my well of Wellbutrin is Running dry of serotonin I can say things I don't mean Or maybe it's the truth in me I feel it building, bubbling up My t-t-time is up  [Chorus] I'm so (Mis-) misunderstood (-un) But I live for this (-der), my money's good (-stood) And I came to win (Mis-), so step on up (-un) And I promise you— Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat) Only one of us Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat) Only one of us Only one of us gon' make it out alive  [Verse 2] I've been making my Gethsemane Since I was young, my ancestry (Cutthroat) Was marching martyrdom across the Radadada dumbla plains of Utah (Cutthroat) I can't lie, I've been played By powerful pеople who get their way But I, in timе, will climb my mountain I, in time, will rise  [Chorus] I'm so (Mis-) misunderstood (-un) But I live for this (-der), my money's good (-stood) And I came to win (Mis-), so step on up (-un) And I promise you— Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat) Only one of us Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat) Only one of us Only one of us gon' make it out alive  [Outro] Try me Try me (Ra-da-da-da-da-da-da-da) Cutthroat Only one of us, only one of us, not you (Cutthroat) Only one of us, only one of us Only one of us Get on the knee, get on the knee Get on the knee, get on the knee Get on the knee, get on the knee Get on the knee, get on the knee Cutthroat (Get on the knee) Cutthroat (Get on the knee) Cutthroat (Get-get-get, get-get-get) Cutthroat
Essa musica dá certo com o personagem degolador de akudama drive, só na espera dos edits. Amei a musica
Eso se puso interesante :)
This is such a good song! :D
waiting IT appear
This is awesome!!!!
So bad
I loved it before the virus where ntng changed now everything is changing , I think there is no other side 😢 I am not gonna move further from the origins album I guess I think from here it's changed , I've never expected these days 😢
Jaja si
Dam, this is crazy dope
Lol
Ekmek gibi olmuş
Dan was holding this power for a very long time, only did today was he allowed to let it all out.
uma fuga para todas essas más notícias circulando pelo mundo💜
juste thanks you
E IMAGINE DRAGONS NÃO ERRA NUNCAAA !!!
It gives me like some sorf of "Gold 2.0". i might be wrong, but what I mean is this is fireeee
Tell us how you really feel!  Lol
I'm dissapointed. Imagine Dragons is more and more pop band instead rock. Where is Wayne Sermon's guitar?
I love all song
Valió la espera....cada canción es de los dioses,están hermosísimos!! ❤️✌️
they're back, and they're becoming edgier than before! love this ^^
HOOLYYY SHIT I LOVE THIS
Lo unico que puede decir es que esta Hermoso👍👌
Que loucura
I DID NOT EXPECT TO WAKE UP TO SOMETHING THIS GOOD
SIMPLESMENTE PEEEERFEITO <3
It has been like 3 years since we got anything new from Imagine Dragons, so this is very welcome
اغنية ابو الروب جابت اكثر من هيك مشاهدات ل ١٠ ساعات 😁😂
So this is I'm So Sorry and Friction's daughter
Dan says cutthroat is about “on the opposite side of the record, both sonically and thematically. It’s an exorcism of self pity. An examination of my life – finding that I am beyond blessed – and trying to rid myself of self doubt and loathing. Being grateful for all I have. Ridding my mind of all the meaningless things that have burdened me. Killing the part of me that spends its days lamenting about things that bear no real meaning or worth. Finding that at the end of the day only one Dan will prevail, and it’s the one that loves myself. Loves my past. My present. Loves my mistakes and problems. My weaknesses. My illness. One that wakes every day grateful for life. That lives fully and is present for those that I love.” The lyrics are really deep especially the beginning part! Listen and try to understand the lyrics
Epic!
Living for better days, ohh for sure.
I sense a new album incoming 👀👀
FIREEEE💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
I love imagine dragons but to be truthful i like the old songs they used to make. This just doesn't sound like them
Every song they release is a masterpiece! I will always be a fan :)
❤️
.....
I love this semi-rap 😍😍
Menuda bestia de canción!!
Bof.
The people disliking feel personally attacked because he was right, it’s not them. ✨
Te amo cutthroat pinche canción espectacular 😎
와....😆👍
Damn't men this song is so awesome... I mean... It breaks the esthethic of imagine dragons... But it do it so well that it still beeng awesome... You are gods of music
I can only imagine this song live. Stay safe everyone! Stay indoors! That way we might hear this masterpiece live soon!
Really good song! That sound a little bit different of what they usually do. Refreshing
❣
I absolutely love this, woke up at 4 o clock and jumped up in joy cause i saw this
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES 🤟🏻
Можно сказать год не слышал вас, на ютубе, а тут😍😍😍😍
This song is one of the SLICKEST sounds ID has created. 🔥🔥
LITERALLY a copy of Cradles
The Legends come back
лучшие
I’m already addicted by this one🤯
Esta si me gusto  En mi opinión la otra se sintió de Relleno, decepcionante solo  Si esperabas un álbum
Another masterpiece
...wow
Started this song in a queit interesting style and i liked it, and then the screaming comes and this isnt the screams i used to love from dan and then theres no guittar from wayne nor bass from ben and i just cant take these vibes This isnt their level at all they can do lot whole better

I love a Band 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Raw  Rough Dirty!!! I like it!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
La escuché antes que la publicaran 😈
Me encanta
I love how diverse your vibe is- from songs as soft as your acoustic version of Thirty Lives and then songs like this that I can just scream along to.
Don’t compare this trash to smoke and mirrors. Imagine dragons have truly fallen
I haven't heard Dan yell in my life.😮
Regresaron Más Fuerte Los Dragones Imaginarios OwO ❤️💪
Awesomeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!
NEW SONG EVERYONE!
i love the fact that they aren't swearing in they songs love this song, this is what i can say only

Очуметь,как круто!!!!
The first lines gave me such goosebumps. This song is somewhat different from other Imagine dragons songs, his voice seems so different here (and I'm not complaining). Makes me feel like I'm in the apocalypse for some reason.
Ésta canción vale cada maldito segundo que esperé su regreso, por ellos le hecho ganas a la escuela 💞💖
These man fell off hard
Anyone else think the first verse sounds like a verse in a black clover opening?
Оххх, эта энергетика 🔥🔥
What is dis lmao...😂😂😂 Ik you are trying to mix it up but dis is only creepy...
Ay me gustó más está JAJAJAJA
To everyone who disliked turn on your location    I just want to talk:)

Im just imagining this song live version .....🤔😐
Yesterday i heard these song over 25 times and follow me 30 times i couldn't stop i love this band     Like if you do to
got to be honest thee meme Where banana is running through my head "Where imagine Dragons lol" Out of all there songs this is a pretty hardcore song. It sounds like something you would hear in 80s and 90s. If I didn't know this was Imagine Dragons singing this I would have no clue who was 🤣 Anyways hope y'all have a great day
Buenardo
I'm really excited and really looking forward. He's hitting high vocal notes and screaming much more easily, which is a thing I really like about him. The last time that I saw his voice being so powerful was until 2014 because he started to get tired and his voice was not the same for a long time. But from what I realized just by watching these short videos from the new album it improved a lot, maybe it is better than at that time, it will be really cool to see it up close, in his shows because in my opinion it is the best band to perform all over the planet, and I also hope that he will stop using pre-record but even so it does not change the fact that he is the best band with the best shows
☺
So basically... Dan is just as anxious about the Cicadas that are supposed to swarm us this Spring / Summer as we are?!  lol
Imagine Dragons: does a different amazing song  People: 1000 dislikes   Really? This is why I hate pop fans in general, you don't let a band be more experiental, change, EVOLVE, offer diff stuff. Imagine Dragons doesn't deserve this. You know why your band was so hated some years ago? You know why? Exactly for this  This is just the single, so I'm expecting the album to have stranger songs than this one. It will be masterpiece, you are just not ready if you think this is "trash" and a "disappoinment"   Sorry if I sound mad. it's okay if you don't like it or if the sound isn't for you, just don't send that enormous hate to them pls
AC/DC is proud now
Wow🔥🔥
Did Dan write these lyrics when he was 14?
This one exactly what I want to hear these days.
I really like this song it kinda reminds me of natural mixed with something TLT would make, but I'm no music critic so to each there own.   also "only one of us gon, make it out alive and it's not you" that sounds like something a Karen would say to the manager.
Me to corona :Only 1 of us can make it out alive and it's not U
This is fire
OMG it's like horror
It was so good song ♥️🎧
This feel so wierd

Smoke + Mirrors return?
Dan non riesce a scrivere canzoni che i fan possano cantare senza sputare le corde vocali e i polmoni
💯🔥
Amazing!
Imagine dragons meet nine inch nails
Loving this rage feeling when I listin to this.
Me siento como en una misión, es que se escucha todo bien épico, como si fueras a tener una batalla AJDKAJKFJAKF🖤
I really like imagine dragons but i wish there were more guitar parts. It's a bit frustrating
Ok
AAAAA LANÇARAM A BRABAA🥳
Hiii

Im kinda intrested in what this song is about I was Listing to it late last night all through the night.
https://youtu.be/XMxvcf_5lG0
This is F#$@!$# awesome. This isn't usually my style but it's kicks ass!  This is the era! Perfect song :) <3
This song is great, although the vibe i get from this song is way different than any other song ive heard from them lol
I'm sure AMVs are cooking

Música muito boa
1:55 that's just pure art  I love these guys so much!
I really loved I enjoy all 😚😚😚😚😚😚😙😙😗😗😗😗😗kiss for the best latent
Why are people hating on the song? Just because it sounds unique & different.  This song reminds me of system of a down or NIN and is pure hard rock.....I like this song more than "follow you"  It seems people have forgot rock 😔
Imagine Dragons: Creates new song Me: Browses YouTube and sees song, 'Screams' My parents: Whats the new song called and can we listen to it?!
EU AMO VCS COME TO BRAZIL AFTER QUARENTENA TAMOJUNTOKKKKKKK 😎✌️
JHEEZ THIS IS SOOO GOOD
З поверненням! 🥰
Woo hoo

Nice natural "auto tune" voice!
No se habían separado?
💙💚💛💜❤💗💖
Fuck yeah😭🖤
First of all I thought that it's sing Granson, but I do mistake.
Oh yeah! They're back!!! 🤩🤩🤩
Why do people dislike the video? :l
Song for transgenders
Alguien mas de mexico ?
Imagine how many people are joining us every second
I highkey think this is pretty bad. Honestly kinda disappointed with this new song.
This hit hard
Damn Dan! Also this is gonna become AMV fuel real quick...or GMV or hell I'm sure the military will use it.
I came on YT for teriyaki chicken recipe and found this and "follow you" on my time line. I don't need lunch anymore...
Amazing❤❤

This is such a different imagine dragons song but I lowkey love it!
Hello
Why he is trying soo hard to impersonate Billie Eilish?
Что-то есть какие-то вайбы старых песен, например, Friction. Но вместе с тем и что-то совершенно иное, новое, в хорошем смысле агрессивное. Огонь в общем ❤️
If you want to fly just  imagine dragons
the day finally has come
I’m So sorry memories :)
Imagine being a rock band and now writing music that doesn’t even feature a single real instrument other than a piano. My condolences. This band is dead.
Nice

Cadê os brs? 🇧🇷🇧🇷
He leído que somos pocos los que de verdad sentimos la música, esos tonos, esos altos y bajos hacen explotar toda clase de sustancias en el cerebro haciendo una explosión de sentimientos, desde el primer segundo se me erizo la piel, un símbolo de... WOW.. Es buenísima esta canción
Cadê os brs pra ouvir essa perfeição?
This song is very unique! I like it!
Imagine Dragons doesn't have an AWESOME bad song
This and Follow You are Imagine Dragons at their absolute best!
People who disliked: Those who are not gon' make it out alive
Po smokach spodziewałem się czegoś zdecydowanie lepszego. Dramat.

O único homem que aceito gritar comigo é o Dan e tenho dito

First time I don’t like a song from Imagine Dragons.
For the firebreathers out there. Let's Go. 🤘
I love when he says try meeee ! 🔥🔥❤️
Cuanta energía
Because of this song I just want to fight in the gulag.

Buenardo
I'm speechless
I've had a dying urge to scream out 'ONLY ONE OF US GONNA MAKE IT OUT ALIVE AND ITS NOT YOU', after 18 hours of hearing this I'm finally gonna do it
Well, this is a new sound from them. Sort of on the fence about it.
Me vuelvo loca! Esto no me lo espera. I can't believe it. I mean... Thank you!! I'm in tears.
*This could be comfortably a Suicide Squad or The Vampire Diaries soundtrack 😂 only cause its flow! amazing Imagine Dragons once again! 💗*
Missing heavy guitars with deep tune.
wow, very hard.
Nice one🔥🔥

Love this song!!!! Definitely see me and my family blasting this in the car while on the highway!
This is what i call music🔥
This song is for me
Who's here before 1 million views???
This song is fire
What a great start for weekend !
Because “Follow You” was about his relationship with his wife, maybe this was about how he thought their relationship was going and all that, because the lyrics would support that.
This song makes me uneasy. I love it.
imagine dragon good music
I live this song but one of my many thoughts during this song was: Is his voice okay? Otherwise, I love this song! I have been sharing it with everyone I know
villain slo-mo music
Já tava com saudade mds 💕
The song hits hard yay!!
this is like a present 90’s song🥺
I love your music ^^
Why did the post this at midnight
ohh rayos que les paso
One gets never bored listening to Imagine Dragons. Great job!
Ve been listening  for 6 hours and it's definitely so good. It's one of the best and my most beloved song out of last two albums + last two singles! Still Smoke and mirrors collection is totally the best for me and this seems like a that-level song❤️😍😍😍 Never expected to say this ever
Meh
Luckily they brought lyrical video or else I wouldn't have understood and would have spet alot of time understanding lyrics
My god this is unbelievable
Hi is this part of the new album or just 2 singles
Wow what a tune !!!!!
Just what my Friday needed
You want to be watching the comments like the video friend
This is a song I'll listen every morning I wake up
finally people are united again here 😂
Wow, this is such a different style but it’s still great
The future me: My money's good and I came to win😁
Three reasons I like today. School’s early release. It’s the day before spring break. AND IMAGINE DRAGONS!
God Dan didn't know you had it in you it's like you've let your dark bit out still love it though very unexpected and wild still amazing
It's bad. Really bad. Cacophony
arte
Love ittt
magic.
💛💛💛
This music on the knife round on face it (CS GO, it's a video game for the non gamers ...) it's a blast ! TRRRYYYY MMEEEEE !
Wow.
1st time: I don't know what to say  2nd time:  I don't like it but I'm glad there came back 5th time:  I love it
Que perfeição de música. ♥️
Cardi b up
lo que tanto habiamos esperado, la cancion:
Русские на месте?
Музыка - ужасна , по ушам долбит также как и беливэ . Скрим лишний
Someone's was listening to NIN while writing this... I'm here for it!!!!
and an original new song ??
I feel like this song would be in the end of a horror thriller movie....
Two songs I can't believe 🥺🥺🥺
YESH a new song- (idk if it ish but still)
2 songs in a row. Impressive
the most toxic song from imagine dragons, but still love it
❤️❤️❤️

Hay que felicidad 😭👌

DOPE
man can't wait for montages for this song!
finally you back!!
Imagine dragons goes backs to its roots  * *EVERYONE LIKES IT* *  Edit 1:- the pun is unintended
Tengo un dejavú, similar a la notificación de «Believer» del 2017. Me pareció raro escucharlo por primera vez; ahora es un clásico inmortal.
tu es un petit peu agressif
I'M CRYING, THIS IS SO SO SO GOOD
Love it!
Wooo
Ya mas digam me que há portugueses aqui também
I'm appreciating this song a little bit more, knowing that Dan had an issue with his vocal cords a while ago and yet he managed to produce these notes 😳
this is so cool, but are there guitars? where is wayne?
Follow you: lovely, supporting , melancholy plasant Cutthroat: Brutal, harsh, chaos disturbing  just perfect combination
AYUDA ESTO ES MUY BUENO, PLAY AGAIN
«I've waiting patiently» Que inicio para una de las canciones de regreso.
Is this a new one?
Los Dragones han despertado y con todo!!

Ainda não vi nenhum Br nos comentários Mas vou deixar a nossa marca aqui 🇧🇷
im 100% sure this will be used in a movie where main character is badass
I can't explain how I'm feeling right now listening to the new two songs.  As Dan said on instagram the songs are completely opposite from each one. The meaning, the melody, this is Imagine Dragons 🔥
meh
am i the only one who wants them to make a collab with the score
incrível!!! ❤🇧🇷
I'm 4 hours  late ༎ຶ‿༎ຶ
who else is true fan of believe and thunder ✌✌
Next "Believer" 🖤
Your music used to sound magical. That magic is gone... This is tragedy :(
So y'all wanted Dan to scream, right? Here you go
Imagine dragons makes the best music 😍
I like where does this song leads the whole album, Rick truly did his job
Plus the chorus sucks.
I gave a dislike to this song. Such a disappointement.
I’ve listened to this 5 times already
I just remembered of Kodaline. Such a band.
This will be 20 years old soon
Simplesmente perfeita... e tem como esperar menos da melhor banda?!
Creepy lyric video but absolute banger of a song. Imagine dragons done it again
쩐다 존나 좋아
So many good animations are going to be made with this
OMG !!!

Ahhh que felicidad escuchar nuevas canciones, se les extrañó ❤️
Follow you was a good song i vibes with it it was nice but I wasn’t take. Aback or anything. This song took me by surprise and DAMN!
emotional infused lockdown song
Русский комментарий . Песня классная и интересная .
Very very good
Yo: comienzo a sentirme triste en la madrugada  Imagine Dragons: no en mi guarida hijo de perra B)
Who would’ve thought they’d release such a song 🥲I’m so happy
Personally not the biggest fan of this. As someone whose ancestors also walked across the plains to Utah, his references to that heritage here are kinda cringe. Also, the use of Gethsemane, which is seen as one of the holiest places on Earth by my faith, doesn't sit well with me. I also am not in love with the vocals in the chorus.   But hey, that's just my opinion, if you love it, great.
The only bad thing about I Follow You and Cutthroat is that they are too short
This got some S+M vibes and I’m here for it
This should be a theme song on "Saw" movie
Me acabo de despertar y estoy escuchando esta joya, no me imagino cuántas views va a tener en unas cuantas horas, por cierto xhupenla gringos somos más >:)
👍👍👍👍
It took time but ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Who is here in 2021
Hey! Que los latinos igual escuchamos canciones en inglés.
The melody at @1:47 reminds me of something...can someone help me out?:)
Oooo, I love this!
Imaginé dragons foreve❤️

Heard 5 seconds and already like it
villan vibes song, yes, that's what i need today
This is SO GOOD <3
seem like a korn song without the instrumental
I wanna understand is this album 2 songs only?
MI NUEVA CANCIÓN FAVORITA 🔥
Who thinks cutthroat was in natural lyrics or is it only me?
Not you
Imagine Depression
Los Dragones han vuelto, y traen fuego 🤘🏼🔥

Por Dios... Parece el soundtrack de una película de terror, y me encanta
Very great!!!
Damn, Dan's voice, I missed it
This is so awesome
Wey, soy el único que murió con ese RADADADA DUMBLA! de Dan, esta bien pinche genial.
Wtf? This is not imagine dragons i know...
My birthday is tomorrow, this feels like a present.

Imagine Dragons, ya'll used to make really good music,the likes of 'It's Time, Radio active and Gold.' You used to make quality music, of late,you're not. This just isn't it for me.
Que buena música!!
whoa
This isn't a pop music it is rock and pop
Is this a threat?

this reminds a little bit of ''flyleaf cassie'' in the verse parts
Ameeiiiiiii aaaaaaa😍😍
The song starts with  "I've been waiting patiently", so awesome line we all fans are too thanks a lot for new songs
Imagine Dragons' Italian fans...can I hear a wahoo?😁🇮🇹
Omg!!!😻🤍
After waiting for over 2 years... It finally happened, they finally made 2 new songs, just 1 would be enough, but the more the better especially for them, they are my FAVORITE band ever, that's why I nearly cried, the only thing that can make me this happy is God and baby's.
Mm nice song guys
Cutthroat
OMG! Really missed Imagine Dragons, such an amazing song! Love it 💜
This is the highest pitch I ever heard from Dan since "I'm So Sorry"
Who needs drug with this song!!! Im high already 🌪

Great songs, at the same time you may learn English from it xxx
Amo cuando sientes la pasión con la que canta. No solo tienes que hablar fuerte, debes de tener ese sentimiento para que quede así de bien.  Aunque me enteré dos horas después, valió la pena desvelarse un poco más
This is great! I’m early too haha. Love this and I am a huge fan ❤️❤️
Um hello?  Still making good music I see.  Well I'm glad I stuck around :)
Absolutamente nadie:  La gente de habla hispana a la madrugada: temazo ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

For all the German fans: Guten Morgen! Seid ihr genauso verwirrt wie ich wieso so viele Kommentare auf Spanisch sind?
that's creepy
simply brilliant, ingenious
Un saludo a los miembros de Imagine Dragons Latinoamérica oficial 😺👍🙈
Happy Friday everyone! ❤
Необычно
*Нихуя себе еще один трек*
This isn't one of my favotite songs
Ya se les extrañaba
ID: I've been waiting patiently....  ME: ME TOO!!
Holy crap this is great. It was unexpected but great!
Am I the only one that finds it cool how they still release music
I bet some competition show will use this
This song gives me Jim Moriarty vibes
Que contraste entre as duas músicas. Amei as duas!
Wait is this a new song?!
such a different style
Siema
In loooove
Video: English  The comments: Spanish 🇪🇸
This video looks like a film students attempt at being edgy
Epik 2 songs in one day
Вау! Моя любимая группа! ❤
Dan you da best!!
Solo acabo de recordar que el primer concierto al que quería ir de imagine dragons fue en el 2015 ( en México), pero eran ellos o Linkin Park , y pues terminé llendo al de LP ( la mejor elección, porque quién iba a decirlo..fue mi única y última oportunidad,😭). Y después tuve que esperar a que regresaran, es así cómo asistí al corona capital en 2018 solo para verlos a ellos😍😍... (Lo mejor que pude hacer, porque con esto de la pandemia,. Quién sabe pa cuando de nuevo habrá una nueva oportunidad).  En fin...después de tantos comentarios en español y de México no me queda más que decir que...  - ¡México los espera pronto!!
This song is pretty good
De verdad que esta canción me recuerda mucho a "believer"
Ok so this an English band. What's with the spanish comments? 'Confused screaming' 😂
Follow you > Cutthroat
Amazing!!
I cried when I heard it the first time you did such an amazing job! I love you so much!
I don't understand Español.
After a lot of sweetness in ORIGINS, they are back in their Raw form.....🖤🖤🖤
The beggining looks like Helena beat - Foster the people
aqui se reportan los latinos que recuperaron su estabilidad por los Dragons
Amazing!
Wow look who's back?!
Algún Latino?
🇫🇷🇫🇷 Des français ??🇫🇷🇫🇷
🔥
I can say things I don't mean, Or maybe it's the truth in me. 👏🔝
This is not a good song. Like imagine dragons never created a bad song before.....
Now that's the classic we were missing past a year...
Oh, for me sounds like RATM mixed with ID. And that's goooood 👌
Llorando estoy 🥺💖 En verdad amooo a Imagine Dragons Me ayudó cuando maas sola estaba, incluso de mi misma, diría que me salvó la vida, ya que cada vez que me sentía mal, escuchaba sus canciones hasta quedarme dormida y dormía mejor. Y el hecho de que hayan sacado nuevas canciones es muy hermoso, ya que aún no me siento del todo bien, me siento sola, y estás canciones me hacen que no estoy sola y que mi yo, aquí está.
Yes! Imagine dragons are back! 🙌
Same energy as,   Call an ambulance CALL an ambulance CALL AN AMBULANCE     *But not for me*
Wow Dan looks angry lol
Haaaa me espante cuando empezó a cantar jajaja 😂😂
can’t wait to see how he sing this live. remember Bad Liar lol
A esperar el álbum completo con emoción
This is so different.  I love it
Imagine Dragons: *sacan 2 canciones nuevas* Yo: otro comentario en español
👏👏
Favorite band🤝
"Only one of us can survive"
Que joyita acaban de sacar. 👌🏼
7:13 Imagine Dragons:Would you like to wake up half the world with a good song?
"Smoke & Mirrors", Friction and I'm So Sorry vibes
Lo mejor del dia
I'm already seeing this as a tiktok song template
Just gonna put this in the masterpiece section just like any other Imagine Dragons song🥺❤❤❤❤
Let's go guys we are back again
My apologies, but this is my least favorite song from Imagine Dragons☹ 2/10, but I love follow you
🤩🤩🤩amaziiing🤩🤩🤩
❤️👄❤️
Ufas ufas
VOCES SAO PERFEITOOOOOOOOOOOS
It's good but take more time for the rythme
Best in the best)
Volvieron los reyeees😏👌🏽🥰
THIS SONG IS AAAAAH, PERFECT. Imagine Dragons are the best ever.  🇲🇽 ❤️
What the fuxx with majority of the comments written in Spanish? Last time I checked China is still the biggest population. There are no single Chinese comment in this??
Legends are back!
Cool, very cool 👍👍👍
Look if you're gonna scream like a metal singer, just embrace it and get some dope ass guitar riffs in there. This is just confusing.
Spain: Hippity Hopity the comments section is now our property
Wow it's amazing😍
The highlight of my year is imagine dragons releasing new music
i have been waiting patiently for this song.
OMG😍😍😍
omg im ur biggest fan im cryin rn pls shout out!
Its cool 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
OMG
A new Imagine Dragons track!!!? 😮🔥👍🔥  Edit: Just listened to it. I'm a big Imagine Dragons fan but I think I may have found the literal first track that I don't like. Maybe it's gotta grow on me but I'm not feeling it. Poor Dan, imagine him singing this constantly on tour. He's gonna destroy his vocal cords 😬
Me gusta, tétrico suena.
Yo bien entrada en la canción a la una de la mañana Mis padres creyendo que ya me volví loca
Buenisima xdd
It’s a new song??
Woooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwww weary good
Imagine Dragons, Mannheim, SAP-Arena, 2015, 10. October  😌😍😌

Nicht Ingrid; Indeed
Truly love this

Really short, but good. Only way i could pick up it was Imagine Dragons was the “Try me” sounded similar to “I’m gonna make it” in the song Natural
I would be the one that doesn’t make it out alive XD
Latinos por doquier B) venga genteee
Круто
Finally they remembered that they have a yt account
Its so good
My head is lit just like the thumbnail
Русские Есть???  🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Imagine dragons saca cancion nueva, inmediatamente yo: Agradecida con el de arriba por esta joya musical y esta banda que vale oro, plata, diamantes y todo lo valioso y hermoso de este mundo. Además esos gritos de Dan son bellísimos 😗 además del acompañamiento musical del resto del equipo es bellísimo,  Imagine dragons es una flor en el desierto de la misma basura de hoy en día 💖🖤😍
Oh my.... 😍😍😍😍🥳🤩🤩🤩🤯🤯🤯🤯
some how this so fit for a horror Film or game like Resident Evil.
OMG THEY FINALLY BACK
Love it!

Wow such a different sound and that's so cool!! ❤️
OH MY
Omg I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH 😱😍😍
Indian people like here 👍👍
to be honest this song is nowhere near as good as most imagine dragons or the other new one, lyrics don't flow and are grating.
상상용 ♡
Nice 💖

Holy Jesus, you guys changed your pfp, I almost ignored the notification.

Ok 👍
The return of the king.
Bro alrighty
Los latinos estamos agradecidos <3
Why is this sounds like a trailer for a game or something
Si ok ma stai calmo
I’m liking this darker direction they’re taking here, really reminds me of their early more rock influenced works
Imagine how many ppl watching /second and from another country.
I love this one, so hard and loud
Nooo el fandom se llenó de estupid0s possers 😭😭😭😭

It's different from what they usually sound like but it also strangely fits them too. It's kinda like one of those songs you hear in the beginning and thinking "mmmm ok.." and by the end you find yourself liking it more.
So awesome
❤️❤️❤️
I like this one :)
Saludos a Imagine Dragons Latinoamerica

Nunca me arrepentiré de haberlos descubierto desde hace años. Me han dado luz y amor con sus canciones durante todo este tiempo. Me han salvado de mucho y aún así, hacen que se me arregle el día con sus canciones.
Well that's a trip. Not what I was expecting after Origins, but I'm down for it.
Most complex song I’ve ever heard and will hear. Totally unexpected, Beautiful and Powerful as ID is.🔥❤️

I prefer follow you but I’m glad they’re upgrading and trying different sounds. Thanks for these songs!
You are the best band in history, can’t thank you enough for coming back, MEXICO LOVES YOU🇲🇽

SITTING ON THE TOILET NEVER FELT SO EPIC !!!
Asu verga se pusieron bien demoníacos jajajaja

🧐🥳🏆
Cada segundo de espera valió la pena.
love the meaning behind the song which is what sent me here, but damn... This is not what I expected and not in a good way.
Let's see how wide this band spread.  So far this song is being repeated continuously in a small town in Vietnam, where else ?
Now         This is sick
Woao
This’ll be a movie trailer song one day
MINHA FAVORITAAAAAAAAA SOCORRO
¿Me siento? Bendecida, cada fucking segundo es una obra de arte
the songs of this group enter the human imagination. And man behaves like an imaginary dragon
Este es el exorcismo de la autocompasión (from Perú)
Gracias por tanto!!!
Agradecido con el de arriba por su regreso los amo
Joder una canción nueva luego de un año se siente bien
Não foi dessa vez, Maroon 5!
Carai du nada menó
You guy are so awesome i cant.. im so proud of this band i live for this
OW THANK GOD, THIS IS SO GOOD. I LOVE THIS SONG AND HOW IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ANOTHER SONGS
This song is the best worst thing i've ever heard. How can it be so bad, but at the same time sooo good.
Hello!!
Agradecido con el de arriba, pero el de más arriba, con el todo poderoso se ha hecho mi socio mi buen amigo 💕

Me: "I've been waiting Patiently."
Imagine Dragons en su máximo esplendor me llena de alegría su regreso❤️
Vai Twenty one pilots é a vez de vocês
Idk for some reason both the songs didn't really match up to the hype and don't get me wrong I like them but it's not Like thunder which you immediately love or machine or shots or any of the previous ones. Anyways good work, waiting for the new album.
Chingona \m/
Volvieron 😍😍
Amamos, de verdad que espero con mucha emoción su próximo álbum, estos tres años que no estuvieron fueron grises pero ustedes le dan un rayo de alegría a mis días 🥺💗
I missed my gym today morning but after hearing this I am leaving for gym right now.
Ver sacar nueva música de esta banda es como ver a los dioses del Olimpo despertando.
Yay am ealy
😮😮❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm eating peanuts... and then out of the blue this pops up. Now I'm eating peanuts furiously.
Me explotaron lo oídos pero me encantó jajs
GRACIAS POR SU MUSICA <3 IMAGINE DRAGONS <3
Don't forget to go to church after watching this.
You dont know me, and i dont know you, but for one momment, you and me connect thanks to Imagine Dragons. And I want to take this opportunity to tell you that you are a great person, and that things are going to improve   Be strong
It's like a mix between muse and Linkin Park, brilliant
Please comment in english, I'm curious what y'all saying HAHAHAHAHA
WEW!
Awesome
YES I MISSED THEM
this song makes me wanna go outside and fight people
There are two modern bands I can listen to, Owl City (literally I grew up with it) being the first and this being the second
Wow. This song is the most "tumblr" sort of edgy yet. Not sure about this one fellas.
Tremendo es la primera ve que veo un montón de comentarios en español

So i think the big question is: when is the whole album coming? Does anyone have a theory?
HINO MEU DEUS!!!
This is the best moment in my life. The best birthday I could ever have.
Один ролик выходит Двадцать Семь минут назад, а другой Двадцать Восемь. Прикольно!
I think that this song is dedicated to Sir Bronn of fucking Blackwater!

tão diferente dos outros álbuns, como sempre, se reinventando
Video: 0:01 Yo: Amo esta canción.
DAMN, ANOTHER MEANINGFUL LYRICS. THANK YOU FOR THIS ❤️. STILL THE BEST.
Reminds me a lot of when I first heard Warriors on its release. This is Imagine Dragons? Very different from their others songs but still really good!
Ok
This honestly sounds like its gonna be in a movie, while Follow You sounds more like a standalone song
SHOCK
Not you!!!
I'm so sorry but better. 👀🔥

This is probably the most edgyest song from Imagine Dragons yet. It still sounds a bit good though.
Siento que es un exorcismo xd
OMG😭😭 Me encanta❤️
Imagine dragon  works    beyond imagination....
Song's not done playing but I've already liked the video
This brings me back to 2009
Ya extrañaba la música de estos Cracks
i’ve waited for this a lot
You guys are really inspiring
🤟🤟🤟
20 seconds in: mention of Wellbutrin and serotonin. Toxicologist in me: but the mechanism of action of bupropion is based on the inhibition of norepinephrine and dopamine!
Que excelente regreso, soy afortunado ser de los primero en escucharlos, gupiiiii
Damn, this is strong ... I love it
Love youuuuuu♥️
honestly the song is shit, but at least they say it directly at this point even if its a way to late
Holy crap this has such a different vibe to follow you. I like cutthroat but tbh I do refer follow you!
I've been here since the beginning on Night Visions and I'm SO proud of you guys:))
Fucking shit, I can't kill myself anymore, I need more time on earth to listen to this jewel💎

Первый русский комментарий на этом видео
La ame🥰😭 dios son tan hermosos
DAN REYNOLDS' VOCALS
ME SINTO NA OBRIGAÇÃO DE CADELAR
This song got the feeling of their old songs , and i cannot DECIDE whether I like their ild form or the new one. But one think which i very much appreciate is they aren't completely changing their genre. 🔥🔥
Muchas gracias ❤🥺
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🐉❤️
