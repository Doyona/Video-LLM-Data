lewandoski is just built different, his ability to turn players like they aren't there and either get through or pull a foul every time is nuts
Words cant describe how terrible Werber was in this game
And Man City do it again
Lewandoski should win ballondor
3:53 easily the cleanest kneeslide i've ever seen.
Lewandowski is diffrent gravy
“One team really on their game today, the other, very off-colour”- Martin Tyler
This is exactly what we expected to happen in the 1st leg looooool😂😂😂😂
Just realized that it was 8-2 on aggregate lmao
I’d love him to come to Liverpool, even if he is in the final chapter of his career.  From a personal point of view, my girlfriend is from Poland & I visit there often & I see that Lewandowski is usually idolised there.  To see him reunite with Klopp after their time at Dortmund adds sentimental value too.  I don’t think it will happen but he would have a field day at Liverpool in terms of goals.  However, Bayern would be crazy to let him go.  He should finish his career there after winning so much with them.
What
I don’t watch football much anymore but wtf happened to muller I havent heard his name in years only lewandoski that I thought he wasn’t even in bayern I thought he was as good as lewa
Coman is a solid player
Great seeing a Red Bile sponsored team get really well pumped
lewvandoski hat trick
Muller: 7-1 Salzburg 5-1 arsenal 7-1 Brazil 8-2 Barca 5-1 Wolfsburg
Lewandowski is world class, but hasn't done it in the premier League.
A hat trick handed on a plate, 2 pens an 1 he didn't know much about.. shocking defending for a champions lge game.. really really bad
🥱   (look, this is just me desperately trying to stop his goals from going in my mouth)
worst hattrick of goals ive ever seen
GOD
If LEWANDOWSKI play last UCL , trophy would be in Bayern hands from 2021
Lewangoalski and Muller smash it like Real Madrid ... PSG
And some will come and say.. OH its penalties and this and that.. The best player in the WORLD solves matches, scores goals. I prefer 3 Lewandoski push goals, in the past 3 Cr7 push goals to 1 spectacular goal once in a while from a Magician. The best player in the World in the one that is consistent and puts it inside of the net.. Lewandoski is the best player in the WORLD at THIS MOMENT
lewandowski 3 goals in 10 mins. video 3 ads in 8 mins. ads GOAT
They say Ronaldo is a penalty merchant and a tap in merchant. Then there’s lewan
mullers celebration
Vintage lewandowski. If only this guy learned how to play make and dribble, which he's defiantly capable of. He could've been the best in world.
Lewa benze the best strikers 🔥🔥
"Absolutely dispatched by the pole"🤣🤣
Wtf is bayerns goal music though
Lewandowski is the striker elite and I see him on the level of Pele, he is a living legend. So wish he could play for Spurs .....!
Bayern are ruthless.
Imagine Bayern v Man City...Or Bayern v Liverpool....
Lewandowski is a monster! absolute goal machine 😛
Thomas Muller is the dad dancing of football celebrations.
He scored 5 in 8 min so this was very easy for him 😅
7 -1 they mean 7-2
Why the Lemon givin it ears  ?
Last year Lewandowski deserved to win the bollon d'or and for the 3rd time Messi steals the trophy without deserving it. 2010, 2018, 2020
Trzecia bramka...On strzela nawet jajami... 😳
Weren't 3 minutes tho
Spanked
Why does sane always look like he doesn’t care when they score 😆
Capaldo No.7 is basically useless in almost every goal conceded.
What were Bayern playing? According to google, they played 2-3-4-1. Like wut?
lewangoalski
The first words sound so funny after seeing the full time result
7:23 reminds me of sancho’s pass to Fred vs Leeds
They all played great but muller,lewadoski and Coman played excellent
Let bayern get Liverpool we see what will happen
He DID hit it CORRECTLY.
One off the most consistent goals scorers off the generation
That Polish lad who plays up front for the Munich lads.....I reckon he could go places.
2 pens and 1 rebound. 7-1 vs a german team looool they do this eveyrweak. Benzema tho he showed levels 3 great goals against and ACTUAl football team. This lewandowski is great but doing it in germany is a joke
What a player
God Bayern goal celebrations are terrible.
HES A MUST 4 THE BALLON.DOR...SURELY🙏🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Imagine scoring over 40 goals a season for 6 years running and still not being the best player in the world.
Harry Kane’s better IMO
That music that played after each bayern goal they might aswell of left it on  they scored that much lol 😆
WHY WAS THE CROWD SO DEAD
Not really an even playing field is it
lewandoski  makes  Harry  Kane look like Carlton Cole.
I don't know who the Salzburg right-back was, but looking at the space Sané had for the last two goals, I'd stick him on the transfer list.
If that was a ronaldo  hat trick all u would hear is penaldo lol but it was a 23 minute  hat trick not 10
“Bit of nervousness about Bayern”
United need to get knocked out so we don’t have a Barcelona situation on our hands if we go through we will have 12 past us
Benzema enters the chat
And the ballon dor 2022 goes to....Messi🤣🤣
Rubbish hatrick that
Brazil germany anyone
would love to see Bayern take on City or Pool
No one gonna talk about how Lewandowski predicted how the keeper was going to kick the ball and stole it? Inapt
5 goals 9 mins vibes
RL9 THE BEST WORLD STRIKER LIVE LEGEND RL9 THE ROBERT LEWANDOWSKI
A real thumping! 👊👊👊
Robert Lewandowski the best!!
this man shoulda had that ballon d or over messi
6:03 😂😂😂
dead crowd ngl
I be honest Bayern do be conceding chances  if they play a better team they could score them chances that Salzburg missed but Bayern were too good for them
City Bayern final
wont stand a chance against any of the English clubs
Great challenge by Coman
I think a good team would rip Bayern to shreds.
Isn’t this a hat trick in 21 minutes. It should start from the whistle not first goal
Why’s the stadium so empty?
Hearing the commentary doubting bayern at the start was hilarious knowing the outcome
Barca fans will love the aggregate score 😂😂
Remember....... they were playing Salzburg 🙄
???? Hattrick with city or PSG is something but not with... Salzburg 😂😂😂😂and penalties😂😂😂😂
726409th
I think this is the first time a team got barced and Braziled
“Bayern haven’t been playing well recently”  Bayern: “we took that personally”  Proceed to batter them 7-1
Thomas muller what a player 💥
Lewa still had a y6 trim
Is it me or does Gnabry look like Apollo Creed? 🤣
LOLOLOL IS IT RLLY A SUPRISE? Lewangoalski is in his prime
Not bad for an old boy at the end of his career
What a goal machine LewanGOALski is!
The commentating at the start 😂
I think Man City PSG, and Liverpool are the only ones left in the tournament who can push Bayern all the way...
Lewandoski, the hatrick king
Salzburg are making another Haaland with that 18 year old
kinda pisses me off that Sane doesn't celebrate cant lie
Lewangoalaki best player in the world rn
Lol thats some comeback
Bayern fans are awful
Man, these Germans in this Bayern team likes to score seven against teams
Get lewangoalski at United for the summer❤️
2 are penalties lol
Bayern looks weak to me.
Yes Hyper Hybrid is back, this is reminiscent of world cup semi final Brazil 1 - 7 Germany.
PEWANDOWSKI
The veterans once again showing how it's done how silky is Muller !
Goals goals goals sums up this Bayern team. They were unfortunate to go out last season in a very entertaining tie with PSG. When the goals come, it tends to come in quick succession and in a short amount of time. I remember watching the game against Benfica. It ended 4-0 but anyone who watched the match would know it was a lot tighter than that. Benfica played very well. But 4 late goals killed the game. It was another example of Bayern not needing to play so well to not only win, but win emphatically. I really enjoy watching this Bayern team. They'll be a force to be reckoned with, but then again, so will the other teams left in the competition. It's usually current or historical giants facing off against one another in the quarters. Bayern is certainly one of them.
"They haven't been playing that well recently."   😃
Bayern literally have one of the most cleanest pitches and best stadium + Lewangoalski is class
2 pens and a very lucky goals against Salzburg get over it my nan could of scored them he is bang average.
Lewadowski ages like a fine wine and seems to get better with age. 😶 He's certainly got an eye for goal ⚽🥅🎯
0:06 "they haven't been playing that well" commentators curse strikes again and they win 7-1😂😂😂
How the hell is there a penalty 🤦🏾‍♂️ People have not dignity anymore for diving!
Why so many empty seats?
Lewandowski is simply the best striker in the world 🔥
Lewondiver
Commentator starts by saying bayern haven't been playing well recently...that went well
Barca fans with PTSD getting serious flashbacks
This should be how united play 😒
Listen, Man United might not thank me but get the contract out, put it on the table. Let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there, given what he's done since he's come in. RANGNICK'S (Ole 3.0) at the wheel, man. He's doing it. He's doing his thing. MAN UNITED ARE BACK!!!
How is it 10 minutes hat trick?
BT sport highlights are infinitely better than Sky's.
An amazing performance from Bayern Münich! Lewandowski's class, technique, and consistency are outstanding to watch.
0:04 bayern munich took that personally
With this team and this coach they can beat any big team in the world!
Lewangoalski strikes again. And definitely do not write ze Germans off.....
Spurs: at least we scored 2 goals Arsenal: at least we only conceded 5 goals
Never a pen cheats . Salzberg coukd scored one its a free kick outside box first one soft pen
SALZSHIT!
English pundits really believe kane better then lewandoski... I live in a SAD country
Tuahir Ouro-Bodi is a nyash nyamer
ya gonneeee
fraud watch alert lewpendowski. clown
It’s still absolutely criminal that Lewa didn’t win the Balon d’Or
Lewandowski has truly mastered the art of statpadding
6:03 the boy on the right is me when my uncle kept wafting his wanger in my face back in the 90's!!!
Commentator: "A bit of nervousness about Bayern Munich ahead of this game, they haven't been playing that well recently, they didn't really in the 1st leg at Salzburg"  Bayern Munich: "And we took that personally"
Absolutely dispatched by the pol. Aye okay it was basically down the middle
He’s been a quiet superstar under the radar; and he’s been racking up trophies 🏆 over the last 5/6 years. Leroy Sane’s class👏🏾
2 ballons d'or in a row for Lewandowski (2021 and 2022)
My phone wouldnt stop blowing up lol
Bayern back to their best in this match
Torito, decime que se siete...
Bayern Munich vs Man City final
“Muller knows where the corner of the net is” not for Germany tho 🤫
Undeniable for the next Bdor
Give that man a balon dor
Man , Everyone’s specks about how good is levandovsky , but no one sees Thomas Muller how good he is at his age !
Was 20 min hatrick
How bad is Steve McManaman at speaking man ffs shut up
Is that the worst/luckiest hatrick in history 🤣
Who’s Leroy zane? 😂😂
Bayern are amazing, but the defending by RB was appalling 😂
This guy is an absolute beast 💪
Bayern come into this a bit nervous not playing very well.......didn't age did it?
Give this man his ballon dor he deserves
2 pens from diving
Wonderful skills from Lewandowski, a fab player. Salzburg could have had at least 2 in the first half - good block, poor shot, but were overwhelmed for sure.
Munich took Salzburg to Cleaner!
Bro im saying it. Lewangoalski the best striker of all time!
Brazil watching this like 👁👁  😂😂😂
I would eight two be Salzburg right now..
Lewandowski is world class
VAR done correctly for once, love to see it. Lewandowski is just a straight baller
Truly outstanding playing from Lewandowski! 🤩 And what a match! Bayern absolutely dominated!
Bayern look good going forward but they look week defensively it’s okay against teams like this but against teams like city Liverpool and psg I’m not too sure
Stat pad merchant
Interesting how nobody is say Penski but I guess that only applies to the Messi and Cr7 haters
🤣😭😤
Tap ins
Muller what a player
All goals gifted to lewa. What a defence
Wait until a proper side has a go at that Bayern defence Jesus 5 of the Bayern goals were amateur hour from Salzburg to say the least. I don’t see anything impressive in this Bayern performance at all, but the delusion of fans on here is unreal it’s a Austrian side Jesus.
Bayern are a ruthless goal scoring machine!
Another record for MR LewanGoalski 👏 🙌 👌 👍 😎
Is lewandowski the most underrated striker of the last 20 years or so?
There's a strong argument for Lewandowski being one of the best strikers ever
And people will still say that Messi is better
Two pens and one peen goal, perfect
every year a team in the CL gets demolished by bayern, whilst hearing circus music several times
Penaldowski
Another team to go through a 6+ goal defeat from Bayern... this is giving me horrible flashbacks from the time they beat barca.. smh
For the past few seasons lewandoski has been miles above Messi and Ronaldo
And hes still behind Harry kane 😂
The touch for the first goal was van basten esque
boring
Look at that first penalty.  'Never in doubt' ‘Absolutely dispatched' It was an awful penalty. The keeper goes the right way he throws his cap on it.  Shows how penalties are just perceived by whether they go in or not.
Muller is so good, he makes it look so easy
Lewandowski or Messi.. I think we all know who is far taking the crown as best in the world
Wheres the 10min hat trick .??? First goal was on 11/12mins
Bad defeat by Salzburg but they  got the best goal.
Is there a reason the stadium looked half empty?
He can't keep getting away with this!
Tha second pen decision looked abit weird
But can’t leave the farmers league or it would be interesting
Whilst the praise Lewa and Bayern are getting is understandable, it was also Salzburg. Let’s all take a deep breath and calm down.
New champions league hat trick world record I think
Lewy and Bayern 🔥
FIFA beginner mode be like
everyones saying hes the best player in the world but hes against salzburg they cant win against teams in bundesliga
I sware is this fifa or real life
More like a 12 minute hatrick lol
Muller 😍😍 magician
Things that age badly: - Milk - opening statements by commentator
Why’s the stadium so empty?
lewangoalski
muller: 23 assists, 12goals this season- different class
U 8-2 see it (aggregate)
Yep, definitely scores in 10 mins. Defo not 22 mins
Holland
Barcelona fans be getting PTSD watching this:
He’s possibly the best number 9 of all time RL9
well then considering that from the guy who scored 5 goals in 9min no suprise.
Whos lewandoski i only know lewangoalski
Technically speaking Salzburg are as good as Barcelona
Best team in the world I support Man u but this team is the best
Bra71l
The people ho doubted bayern and lewa be like :  😶
They love winning 8-2
Müller having flashbacks to Brazil and Barca.😂
Bayern showing how great of a team they are. salzburg have been blown away
For a moment I had the feeling like I'm seeing Germany vs Brazil 🤭
Muller is probably one of the most underrated players ever
Poor salzberg
Why the empty seats? Covid?
Wonderful Hammering
Multiple champions League winner on this game on the LFC game we get Lucy ward bt jokers
Neuer comes back and it's like a whole different squad lol. Bayern was pissed off
Remember once he scored like 5 goals in 9 minutes
My team (Celtic) get slaughtered for being on end of 7-0 drubbings in Europe, but teams like Bayern are capable of doing that to any team as they've shown on more than one occasion
Super Bayern, wow what an awesome team Bayern Munich does have, Lewandowski the best striker in the world.
That third goal has got to be the luckiest sequence of events I've ever seen.
Teddy Sheringham: kane is the best striker in the world 😂
Lewandowski bags yet more goals against rubbish opposition! WOW!
‘A bit of nervousness about Bayern Munich this evening’   Proceeds to slap Salzburg 7-1
I’d 8-2 be Salzburg right now, rough games, aggravate says it all.
Where there’s a pole there’s a goal
BRA71L!
All well and good, but against a better team Bayern would have struggled here. Salzburg had some great chances and cut through Bayern easily.
They say 10 mins in but it was 22 mins in
How did lewandowski not win ballon d’or over fraudessi the guys has been consistent for a decade
people still wearing masks out there? .. i dont see a mask in england since a year ago lol
The underrated player, Muller die Raumdeuter 🔥
Bayern! Go and teach Manutd how to play good football plz!
The best striker in the world
God I love drinking the tears of all the pundits, haters and commentators when they think Bayern's boutta lose the tie.
LoL
Lewandowski at Newcastle would keep them up
Far to easy
A genuine contender for the worst hat trick of all time.
They smash one go out next just wait
Bravo Bayern Bravo Panie Robercie🤟
my friend had the audacity to think bayern would be out this early 😂😂
Realistically I feel like Bayern are the only team that would beat liverpool so I really hope we dont draw them in the semis
22min 22sec was the time Lewandowski completed his hattrick. What a coincidence!
Lewandowski and Muller are a pair of absolute masters. Lewandowski’s touch and turn for the first penalty, his backheel assist; Muller’s first-time pass for Lewandowski’s third, his two give-and-go’s that led to his second. These guys are on a different level.
Who’s the co-commentator here?
*"Messi and Ronaldo can eat at MY table"*
The intro made me laugh considering I just read the caption lol
Lewangoalski
2nd penalty was BS. No chance from there.
And Messi winning the Ballon d’Or 🥴
Everytime someone says Bayern is not in shape they score over 5 goals lol
Tapendowski
0:27 That football 😍😍 that passing and movement is faster than a video game!
Never seen someone as unhappy about scoring as Sané today lmao. Granted it was absolutely pointless but still
I just 8-2 see Bayern looking so good!
This man is on another level compared to Ronaldo and Messi.
Lewandowski is that guy! He's like Benzima, Cristiano and Neymar rolled in 1.
The king of fast hat tricks
07:02 that was text book Messi goal right there
HAT CHEEK FOR LEWANDOSKI!!! Bravo UEFA!!!! Champions is not entertaining to watch anymore. Where are the football players? Why is everybody acting?. If VAR is not going to take ACTING into consideration, any contact inside the penalty box should be sanctioned with a penalty kick. Today it happened the same thing with Inter. Fabinho from Liverpool faked a foul from Alexis, left Inter with 10 players and sentenced the series taking advantage of this lack of interpretation. Of course, in this case, there was also physical contact which was used by Fabinho. Same aplies for Lewandoski. FAIR PLAY IS DYING AGAIN. This is going to get worse unless VAR starts identifying and sanctioning acting with the same severity they do with fouling.
these highlights are at 110% running speed is stupid
Fastest hat trick in champions league history and that is now 6 seasons in a row he has scored 40+ goals. Lewa is the true definition of an out and out #9. 🐐
United versus Bayern in the final.
Bayern hitting form at the right time of the season, depending on the draw they could go all the way again to stop the English domination.
still don't get how lewandowski didn't win the ballon d'or last year
It only took 10 minutes and 22 seconds for Lewandowski to get a Hat-Trick. Remarkable scoring record.
sounds funny mcmanaman trying to talk proper
Please can Bayern draw Man City or Liverpool in the Quarter Finals and show them a thing or 2, like they showed Salzburg.
How good is muller unbelievable player over the years very very much underrated by the football world.
Lewandowski is proof the Ballon d'Or is a total fix the last two years or so. What a player and he'll be 34yrs old in August, his goal scoring stats are incredible.
Probably worst hattrick ever 😂
Lewangoalski
Bayern will win this year's CL. Fight me.
English people say Harry Kane is better
I don't think any team would want to face Bayern Munich when they are in this form! Well played!
Salzberg were the better team
How is it possible  that lewandowski  has never won the  ballon  d'or??.
2 goals are penalties climb out of his arse
He’s like CR7 just a goal scorer nothing else not a genius or a goat,I watched him in the euros in  2016 he was scoring goals for fun in Germany he was absolutely pants in the euros I knew then that he’s no goat, the German league is pants and we know it the hype surrounding many players these days is ridiculous
Bayern Munich will win the champions league
For all their impressive attacking play and prowess on show, Bayern looked vulnerable at times. Should be interesting going forward
If this was any UK team, commentators would be going mental
Lewa gotta be potm
Feel a bit sorry for RB Salzburg. They have some talented young players but Bayern are just different class. Lewandowski surely has to win a Ballon D'or.
If u see a big score just know muller is on the scoresheet
Bayern will batter Liverpool if they get their hands on them
So technically, Lewandowski has scored 2 hat-tricks in 18 minutes.
Lewandowski could never do this to any English team in the champions league.
Football became so s**t. Penalty is giving even for a tap on the shoulder. Not watching it anymore
Totally bought the second penalty and acted hurt. Disappointing.
Bayern’s defence is a huge issue
Wrll done! Great performance ,from Rangers fan 🇬🇧 BORUSSIA Who?
Meanwhile Salah misses 2 sitters and prem fans claim he's the best player in the world 🤦
6:49 is the most Muller goal ever.
At it again with the quickest hattrick football has seen, incredible player fully deserved the ballon dor 💙
Bayern, Liverpool, City are definitely the teams to watch for this season; I’ve been wrong about City all season but I can’t see them edging it past Liverpool or Bayern; but will be very interesting to see
His 3rd goal was definitely a last minute FIFA screw job
I watch stuff like this… and wonder why my team doesn’t play like this. It’s baby stuff. So easy going forward. It’s how it should be.
Bayern only look good because they play against teams that put 0 effort into games
My moneys on these guys
The Germans are pathetic with their half full stadiums still because of the pandemic, their government needs to get a grip
Bayern winning the Ucl this year
Zalzburg goal was a beast for left foot
“Bit of nervousness from Bayern”😂
6:04 can u please just stop
Eh, it ain’t no 4 goals 9 minutes though xD
Bayern gonna win CL for 7
Awful dive for second penalty. Yet again, ref’s making sure who they want go through.
Robert lewan-goal-ski
Best number 9 in the world 🌎 in football ⚽
Commentary is so poor.
He needs eat his own words the commentator. Saying Bayern not been playing best then bags 7 in the game lol.
At least my tolisso is getting upgraded
If ever Thomas muller could be incapsulated in a goal, it’s his 2nd there. Top class
Leroy Sane is something else. What a player
7-1 but Bochum thrashed them and lost me a fortune. Divies
Easy mode on fifa this game
Would be brilliant if Bayern play Man City in the next round.🤣 Bayern would smash them too!
Lewandowski is the best player in the world. And has been for the last 2 years
Wow, the first 10 seconds of this video aged well
Poor Salzburg
Two pens by the way not really too impressive lol
Anyone know why the camera angle is so shallow?
Bayern are scary, I would love to see them play liverpool/city
“They haven’t been playing that well recently”
Wait what?
gotta be one of the worst hattricks i've ever seen
if this man doesnt win the bloody ballon dor this year its rigged should be 2 inna roww rn
Keeper has had a right mare
Imagine lewandowski had actually signed for Blackburn 🤣
Lewendisney doesn’t deserve a ballon d’or. He legit scored 2 penalties and a tap in on a open net when the keeper was outside the box, he the proceeds to knee slide all the way to Kenya. Best player in the world is supposed to make u get off ur seat. This nonsense ain’t it man.
Lewa scored 2 penalties but no one is calling him tap in machine when Ronaldo scores people jump on him and say he's a tap in machine no wonder Ronaldo loves his haters so he can shut them up all the time by the way lewa will never reach Ronaldo legacy Ronaldo is the elite level proved it around the world and still playing in the hardest league end of his career there's only one cr7 greatest player in history were ether players run away while Ronaldo is standing his ground against the best players what a legend
What a player Leroy is!
The first two penalties pure cringe
Done a brazil
Nice dive for the second pen.
Somehow 3 in 10 isn't that impressive for him.
“Bayern haven’t played well lately” well lewandolski took that personally
This gives me the urge to watch Germany vs Brazil 2014 World Cup Semi-Final again! The Brazil fans reactions were better than the match!
this is the bayern we needed to see again, lets go
And Sheringham said Kane is better than Robert Lewandowksi.... What rubbish lol 😂
Bayern look awful at the back
Zawsze ten Sam Level a czy da sie Wyzej heh liga mistrzow Twoja Robert😉 Brawo Lewy👏👏👏
Muller is just a german bergkamp…so elegant to watch very clever
“A bit of nervousness about Bayern Munich”
Nervous eh?
Lewandoski’s control from the air is absolutely phenomenal
close game
Penaldowski
Messi will still get balon dor
Lewandowski was always going to be the talking point but I need to mention Sane, what a brilliant player he has become since joining
It's a shame because RB created so many great chances especially the first half but poor finishing and shambolic defending undone the hard work in the first leg
its a shame for me that RB salzburg got drawn with Bayern. they are a inexperienced but so damn talented group of players. Lewandowski did bits but also big up to Piatkowski for putting in a decent CB performance during a thrashing.
Got to be the worst hatrick ive ever seen that
Barcelona fans watching it getting PTSD
Lewangolski
Personally it's got nothing on the 5 goals in 9 minutes against wolfsburg they were brilliant
He ain't bad is he this lewandowski fella
6:05 real highlight of the match😂😂
0:20 "...[if Bayern don't win] their season could rather disappear on them" Oh no, and only win the league and Cup double? Disastrous!
And I’ve been hearing people say Harry Kane is the best striker in the world. Doesn’t even come close to this guy. Lewandowski is just another level
One of, if not THE best goal scorer in the world rn. Just born to score goals been doing if for years now
Lewandowski is unstoppable - unwatched scores with ease, watched to closely makes up penalties or gives teammates opportunity to score.
Brazil and Barcelona to Rb salzburg: I feel your pain bro
Forget haaland, people want to be flirting with Lewa!
Mullers been playing for decades wtf 🤣🤣
Lewandowski is a quality striker there's no denying that but hate the way they say how many minutes it took to get the hat trick like it's dead impressive two of the goals where penalties so trying to hype up the hat trick more than it really is
How often do we see a player following in a goal bound effort knowing there's a chance it's going to come back out off the post? Rarely ever happens methinks.
I knew that bayern would kinda smash salzburg but damn 7-1
Damn,  I really enjoy the way that bayern, put things in order..killer!!
6:04
I'd assumed it was 7-1 on aggregate....Poor Salzburg! Then again, I captained Sané on Champions League Fantasy Football so I don't mind too much!
the best footbal player in the World :-)
Haaland 2.0 scoring Salzburgs goal 😳
What is it about Germans winning 7-1?
22 minute hattrick not 12
Lewa hit his hat trick nearly as quick as my dad left
People might say how 2 of the goals were penalties, but the way he turned Wober both times was ridiculous. If he didn't take him down for the first one it would've been a beautiful 1st touch and finish!
it's 7-2 @btsports not 7-1
Goal machine
Lewandowski should be on his 3rd ballon d’or and we all know it
Bayern Munich took it personally 😳
Day after Teddy said Kanes the best in Europe 🤣
How did Messi win ballon dor smh
Sane literally scores when he wants haha
Penandoski
Not even 8-1
The keeper was completely trash, Lewa is a great player but this wasn't his merit. It was a bad opponent.
Are there still heavy Covid restrictions in Germany cus that is a dead atmosphere
Would love to see Lewandowski end his career at Liverpool, he’d still one of if not the most consistent and lethal strikers in the world and is still as fit as a fiddle and can play at the same level for the next 3-5 years at least
Great player but let's be honest bundesliga is bang average.
Imagine being a Salzburg supporter and having to hear the can can seven times
That 1 goal was better than Bayern's 7
Lewandowski too good in front of goal Bayern dominating
somebody made a typo!
Lewandowski got a weird celebration…
Lewangoalski
That's exactly how Bayern win CL's games they've got goals from throughout the team they don't just rely on Lewandoski although who better if u were. Bayern have to be responsible for some of the biggest winning  scoreline's in the CL just look at the Barca game in recent years
Lewandowski and muller its always them in the league and in big European nights 🔥.
Boring match !!!
Your turn Haller
Bayern are the best team in the world. (West Ham fan)
4:27 ho ho ho hoa
idk why we sold sane to then bring in greilish... I would be taking sane out the two...
Something inherently satisfying about watching the energy drink teams getting battered.
Muller>bruno penandes
dont worry they will probably give the balon de merde to messi again just to make sure ronaldo does not catch up to him.
If Lewandowski took one of the penalties with his left, then he'd have the true perfect hattrick. A goal with all 3 legs
This was disgraceful from Salzburg. Absolutely shocking to play like that in the knockouts against Bayern. That defender was AWFUL
Bayern taking the piss… making Salzburg listen to that music 7! Times…
didn't look nervous at the end 🤣
Champions League is now just a farce.
Everthing nice but they need to be more concentrated at the back
they did a 2014 Germany vs Brazil. Sorry not sorry Brazilians. I laughed so hard that night.
Still 0-0 lads
Lewa won both the first two pens as well. That turn for the first one was just absolutely unreal
I'm sure someone is currently scrambling trying to find a reason to deny Lewandowski another Ballon d'Or
Lewandowski must've watched Ollie Watkins' goal against Southampton. He did almost identical turns as Watkins to win both penalties.
Lewandowski is a world class striker ⚽️⚽️⚽️
Dear Arsenal fans, this will be us next season 🤣😅
Man at the begining of the vid said "Bit of nervousness about Bayern Munich"... Couldn't of been more wrong.
Such a shame, was rooting for Salzburg
If I had to pick a foreign winner of the Champions League this season, Munich would be that team. They are just so efficient and like tonight, absolutely ruthless and will continue scoring even when the game is clearly won.
Only 12 minutes to score a hat trick, that’s pathetic. try scoring 5 goals in 9 minutes
Ooof the Brazil
I miss Sané man, total domination if he was still with us at city.
Absolute ruthless display from Bayern, they are still a team that no one will want play in the quarters and they are still missing Goretzka and Davies
Lewandowski is 1 of the 5 best striker in the Football history ever definitely
This guy probably has the shortest average distance per goal
Gnabry looking like he’s ready for Boogie Nights
The score 7-1 Brazil  Aggregate 8-2 barcelona
Lewangoalski is the name his parents never give him
Goat St. He's scored 40+ goals a season for then past 7 seasons. Crazy crazy man
I really hope Bayern get Man City and batter them
"a bit of nervousness about bayern munich" welp....
thomas muller has been so underrated throughout his whole career. such a unique player and always knows how to find the net somehow
Lewa might break Ronaldo's record of most goals in CL season
lewa technique is CRAZY, the guy has one of the best touches I have ever seen
:)
Lewandoski scoring a hat trick in the round of 16, even though my idol Pionel Pepsi will receive the next ballon D’or for scoring 2 goals in the farmers league
germany brazil
Brazil fans get bad flashbacks from the score   Barca fans get flashbacks due to the aggregate score   Bayern never fail to ruthlessly destroy our fun.
He loves breaking records lewandowski  12 minutes it took him to score 3 today  He once scored 5 in 9 He is a man who scores goals in a hurry
Bayern are still a team to avoid in the UCL.
Lewangoalski
Best player in the world
3:08 The second place at the Ballon D'Or using the technique of the third place at the Ballon D'Or ❤
Fastest hattrick in UCL history and I’d also add.. luckiest and worst hattrick also 😂. But it’s more than deserved, Lewandowski been super unlucky in the last few weeks and had no service, about time something went his way…
Bayern are PSG before PSG
Lewangoalski shoulda won that ballandor!!
Lewangoalski with the hattrick! And The goat Muller with 2 goals! I can just feel the power of Bayern winning Champions League!
But they said Harry kane is better 🤣🤣
Alles gut
both stonewall penalties. refs doing well so far. keep it up!
Lewanpenski
Lewa should have a Balon dor already
Suiiiiii
Lewandowski does not step up in big games I heard 🤔
How Lewandowski hasn’t won a ballon d’or yet is beyond me
Lewangoalski
Well done bayron!
Lukaku > lewandowski
Rb Barcelona
While Messi continues to prove why he won the ballon D’or by scoring 2 goals in 17 games against absolutely no opposition in France. Keep those awards coming!
Literally the best striker of the past 5 years.
Lewy scoring machine
Kane > lewandowski
WATP
Ucl matches to reach 85 goals: Robert Lewandowski 104 Lionel Messi 107 Cristiano Ronaldo 121 And a 12 minute hat trick to add sparkle to it  He surely is the best in world right now
Lewangoalski
Lewangoalski strikes again🔥
Lewgoalski

Lewandowski is such a legend. Him and Salah battling for that Ballon D’or
