One of the best games of all time.
The limbs for that Reece James goal was unreal.
That roar after reece james goal gives me goosebumps 🥶😮‍💨
Bro. This game hasn’t been equalled yet since this. Warra passion
I remember it was so intense at the bridge
Great to reminisce, and Tuchel showing Conte, don't mess.
2:40 Perisic got an asisst with his left foot, so two footed
0:33
Anyone just come from the Stephens red card?
❤
Jorginho and Sterling now both at Arsenal.
Everyone talks about the North London Derby, but Tottenham v Chelsea never fails to disappoint! 😅
1:10
Another Anthony Taylor disaster
How is this only 1.9M views😭
Came back to see this match but whyd the commentator say well well well when koulibaly scored😅
Miss this time
I want tuchel back
Kane’s goal was the’ right sort of London goal’… goals only scored by the big 3 of London.. obviously other goals have been better, but that equaliser, especially because of the deftness of the header, and the Time it came, just seems like the perfect London goal ❤
Both of these teams get battered everywhere they go
I think tot just needs Harry Kane they were really good when Harry Kane was there
Here after caisedos disallowed goal because a player was “interfering with player” and was offside but hoijbergs goal in this match stood
Coming back here after 1-4 against spurs. Karma got romero back for the hair pull on cucurella
Swear I’ve watched this about 30 times
Last season was class
Who is here after Mike dean podcast “ protecting his mate Antony Taylor “ 😂😂
Who Else Came Here After Mike Dean’s Admissions??
Who here after Mike deans comments 😂
WHO’s hear after the Mike dean admission ? Unreal 😮 as if the rep for referees couldn’t get any worse 😅😂
This game is viewed alot different now after what Mike Dean has said.
Comment onMike Dean declined to use VAR to save a 'mate' and fellow referee from 'grief'
“He’s worth the money in’he Todd?” No
2:38
Well done to both their managers!     For both getting sacked
Was in MHL behind reece james’ goal was absolute limbs in there
its been a long time since we played with passion like this. no tactics since tuchel left
Who would of thought chelsea would have this amazing season after this first game, £600 plus mil spend and 12th in the league 😂😂😂
Both Tuchel and Conte are now sacked.
Imagine Tottenham  buys all the players  in the world just to hold the same smoke every season
Tottenham might be our biggest rivals😂
Now both mangers are gone
Both of these managers are sacked now 🤣
2:14 quality limbs from Chelsea
Can Tuchel come back!
come on you spursssssssssssssssssssssssss
😅
As a Chelsea fan, I sorely miss Tuchel 😭
Man, what a different atmosphere it was back then. The boos were of support. Now the boos are toxic.
6 months later, dare I say one of the best or at least most intense Premier league games ever?? Had absolutely everything
Potter don't have the sauce like big Tommy T
Thomas Tuchel: to conte look at me in the eyes😂
Ever since conte rattled tuchel Chelsea and him went down hill 😂
Why does literary every 2-2 draw between these 2 ends up in a fight or being a crazy game
Love this game as a neutral! Something happens EVERY time 😂😂
I watched this game whilst on holiday in greece. I consider myself very lucky
Looking back on this, chelsea we’re robbed
Looking back at the 2nd goal for spurs, I don’t think it was a foul because Romero pulls his hair before the corner was even taken😂
harry kane silenced the recce james hes one of our own
Everyone, chill.
Battle of Stamford Bridge I (Chelsea v Spurs 15-16) Battle of Stamford Bridge II? (Chelsea v Spurs 22-23)?
Sunday 14th August 2022
where it all went downhill for chelsea
These managers got red card lol
The way Koulibaly hit that volley 🔥
Was the hair tug not on there?
Hojbjerg 1-1  1:07 Kane 2-2  2:37
Reece James hes one of our own?🤣 harry kane disciplined the chelsea fans
lol
Managers need to grow up
when the bit happend i was like ooooooooooooooooooh
They’re talking about the foul on Havertz but what foul, it’s a perfectly clean challenge
Cucerrela stamped on romero. No talk about that. Hair pull isn't dangerous play. Should get a hair cut anyway.
great to see the passion from the two managers at the end. we've all been there. sometimes you lose your cool. nothing wrong with it. shouldnt even have been sent off really
COYS HAHAHAHAHA
*Richarlison is definetly not blocking Mendy’s vision*
0:27 first goal
Encouraging for Spurs, that even when they have an off day, they can still get a draw, away, to so called top 3 team
i think the managers should have a boxing match for charity
2nd Tottenham goal should not have stood
I can't believe that they put mike dean on var. Shoutout to younestalksfootball who explains everything perfectly
“Every single day, every time I pray, I’ll be missing you” - Kai Havertz
When in doubt: Spurs will just cheat
Both teams did their part for the disgraceful referee to ruin it all. What a poor ref!
Best game of the season so far , so proud to be CHELS UTB 💙💙💙💙
I'm a die hard Celtic fan but I can honestly say that the Premier League this season has been so good to watch. This passion is exactly what you want from a derby match. Obviously nowhere near the intensity of an Old Firm but this fixture is very quickly becoming one of the greatest derbies to watch for any neutral
Okay but why show the altercation at the end, is that a highlight as well? Sensationalism like this isn’t good for anyone but the media.
Conte vs Tuchel would be one of the gayest fights ever
Chelsea need Ronaldo and his 30+ goals.
I’m not a spurs fan but they definitely deserved it
Why was Tuchel being an absolute Conte?
Nice to see a game where tampons aren’t for sale in the mens lav.
Anthony Taylor is a disgrace.
I really enjoy these big Derby matches 😁😂😂😂
Just a bunch of clowns
Can someone elaborate these "referee decisions" the Chelsea fans keep talking about? The tackle on Havertz was excellent, Richarlison wasn't interfering with play and VAR can't overturn for a corner/freekick on Romero/Cucerella incident... Was a smash & grab by all accounts but Chelsea just have to take responsibility and not blame the ref.
Mate! Tuchel is a bad loser, when Chelsea score their second goal, he(Tuchel) runs up to Conte to rub it in his face & realising millions of people are watching & doesn’t want everyone to know he’s like a little boy carry’s on running to finish his knobish celebration! & then the not letting go of Contes hand at the end shows what a little boy he is!!
so.... the obvious fouls that were missed by VAR or the ref are not in your highlights... interesting.
I'm not a big football guy, don't know that much, but that confrontation certainly caught my attention!
So… Chelsea have sulked SO much that the FA have decided Anthony Taylor not good enough to referee Chelsea… What happens then, when Chelsea next moan when they don’t win? Another referee banished from Chelsea matches? It’s Pathetic!! Like they have some divine right to win matches. I’m sick of this pampering the Big 6 clubs. Tell them who’s reffing their matches, don’t let them tell you. What a Joke FA we have.
This game was rigged and when I mean rigged I mean rigged
great game and proper passion by the managers quality old school football
So despite na foul, a handball and an offside player blocking the goalkeeper the Spurs equaliser stood.
Fighting at the hen party again
Not a Chelsea or Spurs fan, but what a firecracker of a game!!  Conte absolute legend!!, Tuchel also. If only a certain Steve Bruce had 10%of that passion........
3:09
TT can't stop outclassing Conte every single time they face off. It's beautiful to see.
Absolute beef
Son was shockingly bad today both offensively and even worse defensively.
That’s what we love to see 🤣🤣
That should have been a var check for the Tottenham goal bc i think should have been a goal
As an everton fan i have watched almost every game of the prem so far, the refs have gone soft.
Chelsea are a dark horse this season. Thomas Tuchel is tactically more superior than his peers he is just lacking some personnel, I think Ronaldo would be a good fit until we find something more long term.
Absolute shambles of a game. Chelsea robbed with an undeserving draw. Antony Taylor should never ref a PL game ever again
Tuchel and Conte have been charged and they both won't be able to watch from the bench for the next game.
Am I correct in stating that Spurs 2nd goal was scored with a hand anf if so VAR needs melting down else what's the point?
Bread and circuses
Loved the Women's Euros, but this is the real thing, no comparison
Proper game
Always bad blood in this game….I love it
Spurs gaffer is as scummy as the players
Wish conte had put wee tuchel in his place with a swift bang to the chops
Of course the ref just had to have to spotlight and red card them both at the end, I bet he didn't know what happened, they just didn't leave each others hand after shaking it, don't old friends do that lol? They don't get rugby tackled in the street for that by the police do they?
For Spurs fans this Derby is bigger then those scums in North London
Cheats they are
The level of soccer in England is absolutely incredible!
Didn’t even show the hair pull on cucurella
both of those tottenham goals shouldn't have stood. richarlison being offside and blocking mendy's view (proven by mendy's weight on the knee to look around him) and romero pulling the hair (a straight red). hope spurs fans are happy with their one point, it's a big result when they come and play big teams :)
Chelsea
This was interesting
ANTONIO ANTONIO ANTONIO ✊✊✊✊👊🏽
first decent spurs corner and perisic was using his left foot
W zaha🟥🟥
managers fighting on the side lines disgusting neither team should get a point both mnagers should be had for bringing the game into disrepute
Thats how managers should always act. So much passion and desire to win. Loved it amazing 👏
If Tottenham’s first goal counts that means I can go stand in front of view of the opposing goalkeeper at all times to obstruct his view of the ball even if I’m offside.
Header was going wide. Why is it not an own goal?
Need to see this passion in the prem again
This felt like the Battle of The Bridge all over again, especially when Tuchel and Conte kicked off at each other..... twice! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Antony Taylor should NEVER be allowed to ref again wtf
Battle of the bridge 2.0
Love and peace from Sherpa 😇♥️
Referee disgrace
They did t even show the blatant red card offence which was ignored by officials, 2nd goal should be scrubbed off. Daylight robbery
Whenever Chelsea score and the camera pans up to the directors box I keep expecting to see Abrahamovic there
How come they didnt show cucurella hair pull huh>? RIGGED
Reece James is just that kind of player..  Sterling sleepy in man city still sleepy in chelsea.. needs to eat more meat and stop being a vegan if he wants to become a man
I’m a United fan.. but wow… Chelsea were robbed…
Spurs didn't snatch nothing it was the referee that 🙄 snatched the draw for them end of ... joke decisions spurs were average despite the hypes kane and son went on holiday 😳 🙄 couldn't be seen
Conte should definitely appeal the red card
So how much did spurs pay the ref and var?
Foul, Hand ball and offside all in one for that first spurs goal.
I don't watch football religiously but how is pulling the defender down by his hair in his own box not a free kick? That seems mad to have not been given by VAR.
Spurs should of had a red card. Terrible refereeing
Chelsea was robbed, again. 🤫
Ahhh….how refreshing.
There’s more beef between these two teams then there is between spurs and the gunners atm 😂😂
Conte would have been the perfect manger for Manchester united shame let him go
Yes we wer lucky.coys
Most captivating game of football we've seen in a long time
Martin Tyler needs to retire.
the officials had an absolute stinker
Chelsea absolutely robbed, u cant say that they weren't😂
As a united fan can only admire this passion , its alien to us since the rooney days
We need more of this  please 😂😂🤣
Only 2 games in and VAR still an absolute joke!
VAR stop the game to see one player pull another to the ground by his hair and do NOTHING????
Please sign petition to get Anthony Taylor banned from Chelsea games.
Man’s game 😉
Koulibaly stunning volley !
This is concrete proof that sport is rigged at the highest order. The prem league has no defense to this. Absolute solid proof if you ever needed it.
What the heck was Azbaluketa or whatever his name is, telling Conte.... coglione
This fixture is so clear of the NLD
the game 😳😳  3K
love how they hid the horrible decisions by the ref that lead to goals
ANTHONY TAYLOR IS THE WORST REFF ON THE PLANET HE SHOULD BE SACKED
Trust sky sports to not show the cucurella hair pull which led to the kane goal
What a goal from koulibaly
Two red cards for holding hands  🤝 😄
Lets be honest, Conte would've knocked Tuchel out very quickly.
As an Arsenal really happy with the score line; nevertheless it was a great game
Rudiger who lol what a volley ..united fan
That was a proper scrap and a good game. Premier League football at it's very best!
between
Better than el classico
I'm late, Lol!
How do you expect the fans to act like men when the managers act like children.
The most damming thing, is that if Mendy doesn't make that brilliant save, and the ball goes in then and there, more attention is given to the hair pull, and the right decision is ultimately made. VAR is actively punishing good football. My mistake, not VAR, English referees. But hey, according to Souness, it's all great, it's a man's game again, to hell with fair.
Can we talk about the ref...
manutd are so bad I didn’t even know about this game lol
Richarlison loves attention 🤣
I'm an Everton fan and I'm sad richarlison joined spurs
Why am i always hearing that sound when someone scores at Stamford bridge
That was daylight robbery spurs pulling hair and still allowed the play
Can't call them chelski anymore lol
No one here is talking about the disgraceful VAR decision when Romero pulled cucurellas hair…should be an immediate red card and Tottenham scored because of it
this is football
Anthony Taylor is so bias its embarrasing. Retire him as a ref.
I'm not sure if they always show the handshakes at the end of the game in the highlights but they weren't missing this.
Tuchel started the trouble at the end of the game, unecessary behaviour. Great game of football ruined by stupid behaviour. Don't be surprised to hear that both managers/clubs fined for that stupidity.
Talk about handbags....what a pair of fannies😂😂😂
I like the intensity, it makes you to follow the game with more passion. I think Spurs has come to a level that they can challenge Chelsea.
Amazing tackle by Bentacur
This is why 3rd and 4th place is fixed now. Arsenal don't have the experience and Manchester United are already down.
Hang bags at bridge
This is what premier league football has been missing for so long. Managers that wear their hearts on their sleeves that wont give eachother an inch
Boxing match: Tuchel Vs Conte... Who wins?
why on earth did Conte get a red card?, the german was at fault
Chelsea were superb , spurs below par, spurs got a point away,
commentating was so dead. The reactions were boring
Why doesn't it show the hair pulling.
I wish all games finished like this I would love to see klopp take on pep aka Phil Mitchell
Anthony taylor and mike dean are sped, same with spurs fans, celebrating draw instead of actual trophies😂😂
Chelsea should of won this.   How did Romero not get red card so many times in that game? Talk about bias decisions from the referee.
Unbelievable I’m a spurs fan completely thought we lost it from the first goal but no coys
That tackle on Havertz, perfectly executed
Chelsea and Tuchel have no class, that's why nobody likes them as neutrals.
Thats why its harder for a London teams to win the Premiership. There are 12 local derbies like this, with 7 London Clubs being in the division
Thought this was Tottenham vs arsenal for a minute 😂😂
You know it's a good match when the highlight is nearly 4 mins long
Trust Sky sports to not show Cucurella's hair pull
This is what we've missed these past two months. What a Premier league weekend.
Great battle up! Decent football match too 😂😂
Richarlison celebrating like he scored phantom goal scorer
Richarlison trying to steal Harry Kane’s goal 🤣🤣 celebrating like he had scored
So does that means next Chelsea and Tottenham matches will be coached by assistant coaches? 😂😂
Why aren't sky showing the hairpull before the second goal? Blatant cheats
How is the managers acting like that at the end tho XDD
Welldone to conte for not reacting with an instant slap to Tuchels face. Great display of self-control.
Royal should have been marking koulibaly he’s an absolutely clueless defender
Terrible refereeing decisions, whatever your team is.  That's why EPL refs have such a bad rep.
thanks for the 5 points on my super 6 :)
Like the old days not a fan of either but all the aggression and passion. Brilliant
*3:24** - this is how many people it takes to break up 2 people* 🤣
FA need to investigate this because both goal for spurs can't stand Anthony Taylor needs to get out of the Premier league and stop referring Chelsea games FA need to change it to 2 - 0 Chelsea
Yep
Would Kane's header have gone in without the deflection? Probably just.
I think conte got absolutely owned
I can’t wait for the reverse fixture
That was one of the most dramatic fights after full tiMe I have ever see 😮
03:07 its 1943 all over again!
Why was the hair pull from Romero on Cucurella that led to the Kane goal from the corner missed out? That's a key highlight that changed the final result of the game. Other than that, a great game to watch!
OMG ...I've sooooooo missed FOOTBALL this summer! 🤘😎🎸
I pray no team suffers with a referee like this one.
Spettacolo PURO!!! 👏👏👏
Can someone explain what Richarlison is doing when Kane's equaliser goes in? Dude sprints for the corner flag without even looking at Kane, like he's scored the goal himself.
I hate how every man and his dog runs over when a kick off starts. Just leave the two be...
Harry Kane has just scored an equalizer in added time in one of the best London derby in years… Martin Tyler miserably “and they’ve got it”
I honestly can’t believe the foul against Cucurella wasn’t given, what a useless referee.
Love how sky Dosent show the hair pulling 😂😂
great game dull commentary as usual from Tyler. Past it.
I don’t get these comments lol. If spurs play really badly and still get a point against a big club then if anything it’s better
Chelsea were robbed
One word robbed
what a great player Anthony Taylor is really helped spurs secure the draw
Camerawork at football now is awful. Spend more time showing us the managers, substitutes, so called fans playing on their phones etc while the play is going on.
chelsea fans complaining about ref.. remember last season when thiago antics disallowed a spurs goal.. and this time letting CUcurella off on the 9th min for stamping on a knee.
Kanye was in the middle of that at the end and was smiling ☺️
Some game of football
I cannot see what Chelsea are complaining about re the Spurs goals, both entirely fine. & although its difficult to tell from the highlights, I cant see Conte did anything wrong to get a red, -Tuchel clearly tried to grip his hand and didn't let go and Conte reacted naturally. Great 2-2 win for Spurs.
Good point for Spurs, I really hope they start to bully all teams like this, they have the world class players to score goals they just need 3 x romeros at the back
What a game at start of premier league
One Thing I know for sure is that when we (Forest) play Chelsea or any of the other Big 6, VAR will be in their side every time so I’m prepared for when we lose those 12 matches.
It’s clear to see the league is trying hard to establish Spurs as a successful club with their lucrative new stadium. Absolutely shocking refereeing, and Spurs have the dirtiest team in the league.
The fight was legendary.
Tuchel said the goals shouldn’t stand but said nothing of the foul for Chelsea’s 2nd??
I love this Atmosphere
why didnt you add that hair pull in the highlights? clear violent conduct
1:29 in-depth analysis. The ball deflects off Koulibhaly’s calf.. can’t be offside from a ball coming off the opposing team.  VAR is actually spot on with that one.
Conte should of knocked him out
Let's make a statement whilst the new season is underway stuff the red cards there nothing to the manager's or fines. Deduct points then this thing will end as soon as it started
With all the childish bleating about whether there was a foul before Spurs 1st goal,  nobody even looked twice at Chelsea's 2nd as Kulusevski was dumped to the fllor in a tackle. Clean tackle or foul ? Who knows but definately worth looking at. Just shows who the media wanted to win.
Tuchel and Conte just proved how unprofessional they both are..
Ref shouldn’t have sent them off. No violence, just PASSION…
Shambolic refereeing all the way through it, VAR useless too. I'd be fuming if I supported Chelsea
Cannot believe Romero wasn’t sent off for pulling a player down by the hair. Madness.
Anthony Taylor best spurs player 🥶
Premier league misses these moments! Shame everything has to be so politically correct this day and age. Use to love watching Man Utd vs Arsenal back in the 90's.
Proppah slobberknockah
The Premier League. ITS BACK!
More fight in those two managers than United have shown in years
This game had me out of my seat, so much drama between 2 managers and the fact Anthony Taylor didn’t get red carded when he pulled rucella’s hair down on the floor (it’s clear that he hates Chelsea which I don’t blame him for) and just the tension between these 2 is immensely amazing
And this is reason 497383 why the Premier League is the greatest league ever. Nothing comes close to the entertainment 🔥🙏
Any game that doesn’t resemble this is fluffy. This is what we want to see the ref was bang on too not calling fouls yeh man up get on with it adds to the drama
3:19 why isnt spence not in training kit? is he injured
By far the best league in the world
You know the PL is back when Gary Neville goes like oooh ooh ooh
Spurs are BACK!!
i’m a chelsea fan and this was only my second game watching at the stadium and what a game but a shame about the result
Sky's coverage on YouTube is absolutely awful. Missed out so many vital points about the game. Chelsea were robbed.
Sky sports not showing the hair pull. Oh ? Makes sense it’s not against Liverpool so who cares
Poor sportsmanship, does football no favours
Not a foul on Havertz, perfect tackle, got the ball.
The battle between the two managers on and off the pitch was beautiful to watch, what a game
Wow harsh game
Not the first time Tottenham have cheated to get a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge, not the first time Chelsea have been let down by shocking VAR decisions and not the first time Anthony Taylor has cost Chelsea…
Pure passion some in the league have to learn

As a Chelsea fan, it was tough to take given the decisions the ref made during the game. However, you can't take away from the performance from both sides. It was a brilliant game. All the pundits and journalists thought Spurs would boss the game and give us a beating, but we played them off the park for most of the time. The respect from both sets of players was brilliant at the end. The emotions got the best of the managers. But great game all round. COYB!!!
Tuchel doing a Klopp down the touch line 😀
Tuchel and Conte embarrassing themselves as usual.
If we are all honest here Chelsea won that 2-1
so sky spent more time talking the handbags rather then the game....
Get Martin Tyler off Commentary asap
Martin Tyler the Chelsea fan😅
People seem to think they know the game from the highlights foul here, foul that, ref agenda this, ref agenda that. But failing to mention that although it isn’t shown in highlights Cucurella stamped on Romeros leg early first half and should have been sent off… but yeah for another day😉
At the end Romero grabbed and pulled Cuccurellas hair and then Kane scored. Goal shouldn't of counted and free kick to Chelsea
Chelsea played like prime Man United in this game
Great game but the ref and var got it wrong and I can be okay with spurs having one of the goals but giving them both is criminal. The passions from everyone especially the managers were great though, what we want all the time for the teams
I can’t understand, how people watching a video that you can slow down the play time can claim the Chelsea player was fouled before Spurs first goal. Has the rules changed about no foul if the player (Bentacur) makes contact with the ball before the player???  Bentacur makes contact with the ball first . No Foul.
Spurs look terrible,absolute robbery
Dirty spuds
Why didn't it show the hair pull incident before Kane goal put things into perspective!
Didn’t decide to show the Cucurella foul that should have been a free kick Chelsea’s way?
Why not show the foul before the 2nd spurs goal? Joke VAR didn’t overturn that
Mad
THE FIRST GOAL
They will all get fined for this but secretly the prem is loving it
Richarlison after the 2nd goal trying to take the credit and celebrate like he scored 😆
For "passion" read two adults acting like a pair of petulant and entitled children.
Satisfying to see Chelsea robbed. They have 2 champions league titles and deserved neither. Spurs fan. 🙅‍♂️
Gives me real battle of the bridge vibes
Wait. Why did Conte get sent off? Justice for Conte.
Our turn to celebrate an undeserved draw at the bridge 🤣 I'll take that to the bank and back every day of the week. We were horrible
Cracking game of football but a disgraceful display by the managers. No need to drag the game down by acting like animals.
Conte living in tuchels head rent free
😂😂😂😂
Oh and btw he gets the ball bentencaur
foul, handball and an offside position all in the buildup to spurs first goal. not even a chelsea fan but absolutely atrocious
rigged for spurs
The managers went crazy👊
Completely ignored including the footage of the hair pull eh Sky ?
Koulibaly's goal was actually unreal 🔥
why did conte get sent off as well. tuchel lost his head he couldn’t handle conceding so late so he tried to break contes hand lol
I’m a neutral, but it looks like Sterling has fitted in well - think it’s going to be an interesting battle between these two!🤔
Quality , good to see some passion from both sides and from the bench .. great for the viewer ..
How much was it to persuade the ref
😂😂😂 handbags from the ladies.
Funny how they didn't show cucurella's hair being pulled lol
Tuchel is lucky he didn't lose an arm 🤣🤣
Just Anthony Taylor doing Anthony Taylor things
Lol love the passion of the premiership I honestly thought we’d do Chelsea but they was better than us but we nicked a point at the death cmon u spurs in Conte we trust 👏🏻
How can Martin Tyler almost manage to suck the life out such a good game again… get him gone
Next time someones hair gets pulled in the Prem I don't want to see it given. We want consistency!
How on earth did Reece James not get sent off?! Yellow for taking Son out during dangerous attack, yellow for kicking the ball away in 1st half, yellow for celebrating in the crowd and yellow for wiping Kane out by corner flag at the end. Should we cry corruption too?
After all that spending from Chelsea and richarlision comes into Tottenham and closes the gap 🤣
Who do you think was at fault for the scrap, Tuchel or Conte?
Lol Richarlison thought he scored the header
Tuchels a little baby. That handshake was one of a weak man
The 2 managers are a pair of fuds
How was the hair pull not given as a foul. Chelsea got cheated out of points for sure on this one
What a year this season is going to be you can already see it not so much as a united fan
Do love the way 2 men square up to each other and it takes about 30 others to sort it out lol..
I can see Conte chocking out Tuchel
Are we not gonna talk about how spurs second goal shouldn't have standed because of the foul on Kai Haverts and the foul on Cucerella
I watched it it was dramatic
KTBFFH 💙
Who here thought richarlison scored :)
Chsael manger should saked he bad fetch manger get out of there
How is that a red card for Contè??
Why leave out that hairpull on Cucurella??
Conte is class I really like him he’s a character from a toon fan
Embarrassing af
Richarlison try run off like he scored lol
Are we just going to ignore the fact that Cucurella basically had his hair pulled from his scalp which then led to the corner which Spurs score from??
Didn't fancy showing Cucurella being dragged to the floor by his hair Sky?  Disgusting officiating ruined the game. A true Anthony Taylor masterclass.  The man should be stripped of his refereeing license.
This clip does not show the full story, reffing was slow an  the var was pointless, forever blue
COYS
Chelsea yet again, 2 goals & both from our defenders, last game from penalty. This worries me more than anything as a Chelsea fan. When the hell we gonna have a proper goal machine?
first tottenham goal shouldnt of stood player was fouled before hand any other day chelsea would of won that conte playing dirty by celebrating like that
Premier league passion hasn't lost its energy
Hard to find a single comment speaking about the ineptitude of the officials today, and the impact it had on the result.  Yes the game was entertaining for a neutral, but you should still want a fair game of football to be played, if you were on the end of this officiating you would be furious, especially considering VAR is supposed to be there to rectify wrong decisions in the lead up to a goal.
Ban anthony taylor
Cucurella Hairpull,Richarlison Offside,Spurs allowed Foul Play Simply Suspect Ref/VAR?💀 FA-VARing Spurs in Title Race as LiVARpool falling?😂
As a Spurs fan what a match end to end stuff good game thoroughly entertaining match a good point by Spurs considering our record at Stamford Bridge isn't the best 1st half Spurs were poor 2nd half they were better and the subs made us more of a threat and we played better but overall Chelsea were the better team for large periods of the game have to admit not many teams will go to Stamford Bridge and get a positive result there isn't an easy ground to get a result on so a point from my boys yesterday was a good point considering our poor record there
Was Richarlison attempting to claim that Kane header the rat
I swear when a player gets his hair cut his footballing ability goes out the window. Havertz was Torres-esque today.
This was a proper premier league match, but lazy man u
If it happened to almost any other team I’d feel bad…
Great game, late goals, drama, fights and passion, how football should be
Conte vs Tuchel was the best part of the game. When WWE is in the UK they should invite those two for a cage match.
I didn’t know conte was from the blocks in north London. Park lane is just round the corner from spurs stadium, he probably went there to blow of some steam with the rest of the hoodlums round there lol
Chelski bottlers 😂
Richarlison you need to earn your stripes before you can jump into kane mid celebration. Proper man’s game today
My German wife had to explain the significance of the issue after the whistle. In Germany eye contact during a handshake is the most important aspect and anything less is one of the most disrespectful things you can do.
I don't think I've ever seen Sky Sports Premier League Youtube highlights this long. A whole 3mins 55seconds
My god did everyone get a pay cut ? Its like the 90s, best match I've seen in over 10 years.
Disgusting game. Chelsea should’ve won but officials love spurs again
Yeah I agree  with the managers the passion and love for their club. But one thing I don't understand having camara var especially in this daa and age the first goal spurs have scored its was foul by their players and off side when their defender scored that's not right
As always Taylor did dirty to chelsea
Somehow, it seems that Tottenham will be the happier of the two. Both teams look like they've gone a step backwards - none of the two will be in top 3
Tuchel vs conte,  just things you love to see Thanks PL 😊
This is what footballs all about
Conte vs Tuchel was my highlight 🤣
First goal for spurs shouldn’t of happened haverts was fouled and the still played on
When I saw Tuchel running down the touchline with those skinny legs of his I thought he was a flamingo.
Carragher: There's more space there than there is at Hyde Park.   You'll never be a comedian Carragher.
Let's hype  the prem BS done.This is BS  thankyou sky don't support  the 2 teams just BS 100% .when the power cuts come and we can't watch this winter will Sky pay you BACK.HELL NO CHECK  OUT NO FIT FOR PURPOSE. WE PAY BUT YOU CANT WATCH FOR POWER CUTS.BUT WORK  THE COMPSATION ON SKY GO .
How an earth was that not a foul on havertz?? Someone pls try explaining it to me I seriously don’t get how you can not see that as a foul
Kane scoring the winning goal in the champions league be like that meme when escokane is sitting on a swing 🤣
Spuds can't win without paying off the ref
I was hoping oh so bad to see Tuchel knock the lights out of “money boy” Andonio
The passion in the YouTube comments is incredible. Conte & Tuchel don't even come close.
Fantastic game but we should have won this (Chelsea) we were by far the better team.
From a man united fan I wish we had conte as a manager, he's class
What crap commentating for such a good game
Bmw vs fiat
“Anthony Taylor snatches late Spurs equaliser”
If you can read human body   You can easily tell tuchel lost control during that last hand shake and conte showed reflex    Tuchel did get intimated by conta first hald but    Thats not how you shake a hand tuchel
🤔 no wiser to which of these teams finishes 3rd & 4th respectively (unless Arsenal can actually keep it up and not b leaky at the back🤔) Chelsea at home and having the lead twice will be more disappointing with the result imho Typical Kane the donkey does nothing all game apart from miss a glorious chance and get equalizer in 95th minute 🙄😏
Loved seeing Bissouma protect the Boss.
Lets be serious here. Neither of Spurs goals should have counted. 1st goal was a clear foul on Havertz and then Richarlison was offside as Højbjerg struck the ball towards Mendy's goal. 2nd goal from the corner, Romero should have got a 2nd yellow and sent off for pulling Cucurella's hair and obstructing him in defending the corner. How that ended up as a corner I'll never know why there was such a poor decision from the ref on that one.  Chelsea were clearly robbed.
What a game both are fantastic managers 3 months without the prem. gets more exciting each season
I have a feeling this season is gonna go down in the history books…
Tottenham are like the kid who ruin the night out 😂 can’t they just lose peacefully ffs  Always sniping a last minute goals to get the 4/5th on the board.
Dirty should of been 2-1 Chelsea
I feel like this season is going to be crazy. It might have historic or iconic moments with the way this season is going right now.
You know it’s a good game when there’s still highlights after ft
unacceptable behaviour by tuchel
Tottenham got outclassed  Can't wait to see them humiliated at home. Dont care if its the only thing Chelsea do this year
Worry about defending the corner not crying about a foul when the ball wasn't even in play 🤣🤣🤣🤣 GET IN!!!!!!!!!
Pure Barclays... love it!
sorry but chelsea were robbed off that 3 points, tottenham fans celebrating a draw proves it all
What a game? Spurs scored two goals they shouldn’t count
Correction:its only just started 😂😂😂
Havertz needs to stop trying to be the tough guy and learn to shoot
Total domination from Chelsea. Anthony Taylor gave Tottenham the draw.
Disgraceful referring.
Where is this passion at united 😞 great game of football 👍
YES! GOOD OLD PREMIER LEAGUE. THIS IS WHAT I LOVE. Tell united that this is what passion looks like. conte would destroy tuchel
Love seeing the pain of Chelsea fans, a bunch of Woking lads in Surrey thinking they’re from London
Nobody going to talk about how the goal shouldn’t have stood due to Romero pulling cucurella to the ground by his hair? Pretty sure that’s more than foul play worse than pulling a shirt for sure. Refereee is an absolute joke
Martin Tyler is the worst commentator in football, he needs to go
Great match. Fair result. 😂
tuchel wanted to play ring around the rosies
Havertz is so unlucky !!!!
They didn’t even show the hair pull. Which was a massive incident in the game.
La liga might be more skillful, seria A might be more tactical..  but for entertainment; nothing comes close to the premier league
No replay of the clear red card of Spurs player pulling Cucurela down from his hair before the last "goal"?
Hate Tottenham with a passion
Loctite super glue 3........
many games that cost spurs playing chelsea is wot is it
And a new Rivalry is born ladies and gentlemen we love to see it
London is spurs friends :)
Dear Refs, after you blow the whistle, you can’t red card anyone. Your job is over.
like the good old days
2 men that love the game .
the cheer and chants after reece james's goal gives me goosebumps 😍
at least they have passion and drive.
Great assist from Anthony Taylor and VAR for Tottenham’s equaliser
i am loving this as an Arsenal supporter.
Rudiger would’ve had everyone smoked
The fight between tuchel and conte was amazing 😂 Class from both sides. COYS
The ref must be a spurs supporter because is impossible not to book the spurs players at least once🙄🙄
we got robbed 100%
Talk about touchy Tuchel 😂
Can’t believe the ref didn’t disallow both goals seeing as there were two clear fouls before both of Tottenhams goals if it was fair it would have been 2 - 0 but hey Tottenham will take all the luck they can get 😂 they seem to need the luck 🤣
You can’t disagree with Tuchel here, the technical fouls Chelsea made were all called back and given as fouls, but the amount of fouls awarded to Chelsea especially the one on havertz is a joke… the Hairpull is also a foul and if they judged that right initially then the corner after wouldn’t have stood but eh, as long as you get away with it it’s calm
All time Classic
Proper derby game. 👍  This reminds me of football back in the day, before everything became so soft
When are referees going to be held accountable for their mistakes which cost players, managers and team? Why are they untouchable?
Legend has it, Tuchel is still crying over Kane’s goal
Prove me wrong: Chelsea Spurs is the best derby in the modern PL era...
Spurs snatch a point and Conte makes his own point to Tuchel after the match.......loving it😂😂😂
As a Spurs fan we were very very lucky to get the point. The first half was a shambles. I know it was hot but Christ there was no want or desire to close down Chelsea. And don't even start me on Emerson Royal. Any match I've watched live that he has played in has been atrocious. Surely Spence or Doherty should be starting. All that aside I'm just glad to see passion on the touchline from Conte. The players would do good to take note.
Terrible officiating ruining a wonderful game, this country seriously needs to improve its officials, even with VAR they keep getting it wrong!!!
If Kane goes it’s game over
Loveeee it!!!
Havertz is such a bottlejob 🤣🤣
Sterling deserved an assist for that dodge
I wish as a Utd fan I could celebrate my team scoring and actually putting in a fight again watching this  Were just rock bottom and icl it's acc depressing Chelsea Spurs Arsenal are way better teams ATM credit to them
Just stand back and let the men fight it out for christ sake
Chelsea robbed and I love it
Brilliant seeing such passion from managers
Joker Conte..putting super glue on his hands at the end of the game 🤪😁😂. Teschel didn't get the joke..
I'm confused here at the end. Was tuchel just showing sportsmanship or trying to wind conte up? Either way conte seems a but fragile to be offended by a handshake  How is this allowed to stand when VAR exists. Pathetic. Reinstate the 2-0 to Chelsea scoreline and punish the officials somehow imo otherwise they just carry on making crappy decisions
If I uploaded 3 videos.. one of me kicking my mrs In the shin with shin pads on, one of me half shoving her or shaking her hand and pulling back and one of me pulling her by the hair to the ground.... Which one would I go to jail for let alone get a red card??
What a match all for one point in a meaningless august match in premier league , nothing matters till after Xmas
Both goals shouldn't have been allowed. Both clear fouls and a clear offside too
what was the beef even about
Both Spurs goals were very dodgy, but the second one especially should never have occurred - Romero obviously pulling an opponent’s hair and throwing him to the ground should have been a second yellow for him and a free kick to Chelsea, not a second corner that led to the equaliser by Kane. The ref was absolutely awful today. Having said that, Chelsea desperately need a striker.
Tuchel is a thug he doesn't like it when things don't go his way
Love a good fight!
Tuchel has no right to force Conte to shake his hand. Tuchel totally in the wrong there. Conte just wanted to walk away.
Damn, if Man Utd had a drop of the passion n intensity shown today by Spurs and Chelsea, we'd have battered Brighton and Brentford
Anthony Taylor is Spurs best signing this season.
Havertz is a doooonkey, surely hes just living of that ucl final goal? Chelsea fans?
Well done Spurs!! Deserved the win but I'll take the draw.
Touché l is a W⚓️
The hot weather bring reactions like that
Ref and VAR had a nightmare here. Both Spurs goals should have been disallowed and i say that as a neutral with no affiliation to either team.
Funny how they left out the red card before the 2nd spurs goal
Conte v Tuchel is the new Ferguson v Wenger
Ooo sauce stuff between Tuchel and Conte! Looking forward to this blossoming into an epic managerial rival.
As Man.Utd fan I never thought I will be jelous of Spurs. Passionate manager, passionate team that both never give up till the very end. Honestly I hope we get relegated this year, if we never really touch the bottom we will never return at the top.
Chelsea robbed
Chelsea were ROBBED
Red carded for not looking st someone in the eye 😂😂 ultimate 👜 handbags 👜
Didn’t spurs say they were challenging for the title this year?
1:40 he literally said it was a foul  They don’t show the foul on cucurela
Chelsea robbed
Tuchel such a baby 👶
Spurs Chelsea is the best rivalry in English football rn, so much hatred, absolutely love to see it
I am a Liverpool fan but I hate Klopp and Pep licking each other ass after every game to be honest.
That passion, the ending this is why there is nothing like football.
Love Conte !! Utd missed a trick there !!
Tommy tuchel propa chels💙💙
Perior  to Tottenham equaliser goal there was a foul on Chelsea player and before the second goal of Chelsea there was a foul on Tottenham player. The game finished draw 😁
Timo Havertz
yes some real passion back in the game, then the ref had to ruin it with the stupid red cards .
Great game but wow the referee was so poor, gave everything Spurs way, neither goal should have counted, 1st one was a foul on Havertz, 2nd we should have had a free kick on Cucurella and Romero should have been sent off, shocking decisions but at least we didn’t lose ig
Imagine these two teams in champions league in knockout stage it will be fireworks Liverpool city don't bring that Old school drama 😉
Tuchel is a disgrace.
Sucks for Chelsea cuz the score line doesn’t really reflect how good Chelsea was, but all in all it was a sick game. Conte vs tuchel rivalry is deffo one to watch. Can’t wait for the reverse fixture
Conte Don
Now that’s what you call passion!! Need more of this! Bring back the good old days
Not even a Chelsea fan but both of Spurs' goals should not have counted lol
Poor behaviors from Tottenham Spurs again. Shocking and unacceptable! Conte seems to have changed a lot since took over the post at Spurs.
Perisic is such a great player.only 33 but this man is so underrated
Can't wait till next game
The players were professional but the match officials let themselves down. I hope the hair pulling coward will get a retrospective three match ban. These players have too much money n they should not be allowed to assault players on pitch. Otherwise they will take contracts on each other like they do in South America.
Can’t believe sky won’t show the hair pull. Another disgrace
one things for sure chelsea ain’t lacking in their defenders ability to score absolute bangers from rudigers authoritarian strikes to now koulibalys volleys 🔥🔥
Want some vinegar with that salt Tuchel?
Conte came… Rattled EVERYONE.. then left!
never knew u could get red carded after the final whistle
Manager should be banned 10
Fantastic game, both managers fighting the good fight for their clubs.
Yes Conte!
Hey Tuchel get off the pitch, you've been sent off!!
Kin  handbags  , ! !
Tuchel didn’t let go of Conte’s hand. That was obvious.
That koulibaly finish is what all the Chelsea fans were expecting Lukaku to do Last season
I think it best to just fist pump tuchel in future!
Game has gone to pot !! Bit of passion and everyone kicks off !!
Chelsea robbed
Bro touchellekellel
Nasty football club Chelsea. Love nicking a point of them at home. 🤣
🇩🇪 And 🇮🇹 in 🇬🇧 mixed with the passion of feisty derby.  Brilliant.  Premier league is the best in the world.
conte & tuchel reminded me of groves & froch handshake hahahaha
Great Refereeing!!!!!!!!!!
Why where the managers behaving like that? Genuine question, I dont understand.   Did one of them drop a diss track on the other or something? :P
I thoight some people in this game should hang their heads in shsme for the way they behaved.The Chelsea manager certainly should have behaved better,when he shook his counterparts hsnd at the end.
3:08 Tuchel to Conte “Nice wig”
next time they play, Conte should use a false hand like Father Ted.
Any Spurs game against the other of the top 6 is guaranteed drama
Tuchel is right for me... if you’re just shaking hands as a token then don’t bother... you should look at a man when you shake his hand, it’s extremely rude not to in our culture... a sentiment obviously shared by Tuchel and not Conte, I guess?
As a man u fan I'm jealous of this entertainment
Hope conte at least gets the red card recinded if not both of them, all conte did was have touchel not let go of his hand-liverpool fan
So confused that conte gets a red because tucal wouldn't let go of his hand??? Am i missing somthing?
Richarlison running off thinking he had scored hahahaha
in an arsenal fan, ik you probably gonna hate but hey I’m 14, I thought Chelsea played rlly well this game they worked hard and did not deserve to draw, Chelsea by far the better team whole game
Disgrace absolute disgrace 2 fouls not given var sleeping officials cost us 2 point today best league in the world making these errors even pundits and commentators said the last goal shouldn’t of counted richarlison offside foul on havertz foul on cucurella corrupt officials again in a derby aswell shocking
Tuchel is such a low life. Like a child
Man City, Liverpool and Arsenal look like the definite top 3 this season, but battle for 4th between these two will definitely be interesting
Love it
Please make that fight 🙏🏽 Tuchel vs Conte.  Celebrity Boxing Match 👊🏾😅. What a competitive spirit 👏🏽.  Gotta love it!!!
Brilliant game, nice to see both sides with so much passion.
EPL= Extremely Passionate League. What a cracking game!
Tuchel...Kloop....Conte....Guradiola....Ten Hag....premier league has a class of coaches now....
Football is the best
Tuchel holding onto the handshake hahah love it Tuchel had more passion than the little man today
Anyone else refereeing this game and Chelsea win 4-0 or more.
What a game! But chelsea were absolutely robbed!
Maybe they'll both remember to bring their handbags next time
Robbed
The ref did you mean
What got into the Chelsea manger
Chelsea were Robbed by the Ref, both goals for spurs shouldn't have stood, I'm not even a Chelsea fan.
Tuchel almost knocked Conte's syrup off.
Tuchel trying to steal Contes hand.
ANTONY TAYLOR WAS AWFUL IN THIS GAME - SPURS MADE 9 PROFESSIONAL FOULS BEFORE RECEIVING A YELLOW, CHELSEA MADE 2 AND GOT A CARD - THE FIRST GOAL, RICHARLISON WAS OFFSIDE AND THE HAIR PULLING AT THE END WAS A JOKE - HE SHOULDNT BE NEAR A PREMIER LEAGUE GAME AGAIN
Drama in game and make better
Chelsea bottle jobs x
New Rivalry is Born shessh
I love it this is what it should mean.....
you know there's going to be a kick off when the game ends and the video is not finished
Why was the game so heated? Tuchel celebrating like he's won the trebble
The crowd got their money's worth today... They bought a ticket for a football match and watched a wrestling match for free!!!
This is what you called a derby 😂😂
Im replaying that handshake.. wtf happened there? XDD
Disgusting behaviour from both managers!!
COME ON YOU SPURS TO DARE IS TO DO
Brilliant game
Absolute joke. Blatant fouls overlooked, offside goals, hair pulling. Honestly spurs fans should be embarrassed tbh. Chelsea missed opportunities ofc but overall, Honestly, disgraceful refereeing.   Sincerely, a bitter Chelsea fan x
It ain't even the end of August...getting tasty already jeez. Calm down lads.
Not sure what tuchel was playing at there, Conte would absolutely take his head clean off his shoulders
Absolutely love it when Chelsea and Spurs have a scrap! Probably the fixture that kicks off between the two teams the most in the PL
I met a man on a train and he went to the match
Does the Chelsea manager have a nickname like “Skeletor”. He looks like a walking skeleton.
Conte got the better of tuchel.... tuchel the baby couldn't take it conte didn't look at him
Class just goes to show managers AV beef
All chelsea do is score with defenders and jorginho penalties, they seriously need a better attack.
It was an OG..Going wide of the post
Tottenhams goals aren’t real in my head. There should have been a free for Chelsea before each were scored..how can this even happen
The passion from both sides was unbelievable 🔥
Met Koulibaly before and after the match. Took pictures, had fun at our Hotel's lobby. Just an amazing personality. You can't believe how fine he is unless you see him in person. I'm happy Kolibaly made his first goal for Chelsea in his debut. Good luck Chelsea ✌️
Chelsea’s 2nd should have been disallowed for the foul on the wing.
2-2 in Chelsea’s cup final
THIS IS FOOTBALL!!
Every time I hear carragher talk I get angry
I hear jake Paul is offering either tuchel or conte a chance to fight him after seeing this
Conte a disgrace just what you expect from spurs can't even look tuchel in the eye when he shakes his  hand typical of them inferior to Chelsea and arsenal for years always will be just count their trophies doesn't take long lmao
Embarrassing all round
That game was overwhelming 🤬
Chelsea kinda of got bumped XD Everyone would be livid if those calls went against their own teams.
No problems with any of the goals going by the evidence in this video.
Bentancur touches the ball so deftly that he barely changes the course of it. Havertz would still have it right in front of him and would be able to drive at the defence if he isn't taken out completely as a result of the challenge. When your not actually taking the ball away from the player should it really count as getting the ball? Its a flawed rule
scummy cheating spurs
Two absolutely top class managers going at it. Intensity off the charts. Love to see it. Good old footy.
Official did his best as usual for kane and co and they still couldn't win .....forever losers
Conte will beat tuchel Any day
Managers acted like primadonnas.  Hugely unprofessional behaviour.
Chelsea absolutely robbed
2:45 get rejected by Harry kane
Tunchel lost it , too much pressure, doesn’t do Chelsea any favours
How embarrassing Tottenham celebrated that 2nd goal like they won 😂😂😂😂
Tuchel is a super manager. Chelsea lucky to have him.
How do they not even show the foul before the corner?! You can't not highlight a pivotal point to the game because it was a refereeing error...
Great entertainment! The football was pretty decent too 😂
Sky sports is literally the worst at highlights, chelsea completely dominated this game yet this video contradicts that
Great passion great game to watch thought Chelsea where the better first half second half thought Tottenham just shaded it just conte is like a madman fight keep fighting destroy to powerful teams obviously Chelsea was at home so there be disappointed not to win and ti conceded last kick of the game
How we got a point from that game. Chelsea look good. COYS
Better start making the Premier league a PG rating 😂
Jose and Wenger Moment at the end
Tuchel lol sit down son….. conte would rip you apart hahahaha
New Jake Paul undercard?
Just to say as a referee Anthony Taylor was brilliant today The Cucurella incident before the second spurs goal was a foul and would have given had he seen it In regards to VAR not giving it as a foul that is the correct decision It isn’t a red card as it’s not serious foul play And as there was no goal scored from that phase of play it wasn’t overturned
love to hear the whinging it says a lot
The really funny thing is… literally I did this to Conte back in like 2015 when juve played Celtic and I met him… I was star stuck… couldn’t let go… maybe tuchell was the same… 😂😂😂😂
Heated 🔥 ooooooo oooooo 👻 lol
What a game
Daylight robbery, Romero tried to pull cucus hair off
Sir Harold Kane is my hero.I support Glasgow Rangers.
The battle of the bridge
The Chelsea manager is uneducated
This game was so intense that it was still kicking off even after the final whistle was blown
Both spurs goals shouldn’t have stood. Awful refereeing and use of the var
Under impressed. Just louts on the local park between two pub teams
You what that means don't you?  A new DVD by Tottenham will be released soon.
Close game credit great game we should of won but that’s football
bruh there's a firm handshake and there's that lol
Spurs are so jammy.   I dislike the money that built Chelsea, however that's was a hand ball by son and Richarlidson was offside in play.   Var is a joke
This is by far so far the greatest game of this season
When was the last time Chelsea had an effective striker?
Honestly, considering our poor record at Stamford Bridge, I happily take a point from today's match.
The more i watch the “foul” before Spurs first, the cleaner it gets. Crackin tackle
Chelsea were robbed by the ref
Classic Chelsea fans with the excuses 😭
Koulibaly what a goat, great to see him score
The worst thing about this is that they did not even show number 32 hair getting pulled or the var check
This is what we call football
Any fellow Arsenal fans that are criticising Tottenham fans for celebrating a last minute equaliser don’t understand and probably don’t to games. Every other fan base in the world would do the same. Also, Lacazette ran straight in to the crowd after scoring a rare goal in a last minute equaliser against Crystal Palace
Chelsea were robbed and that’s from an Arsenal fan who didn’t care what the score was
What a game of football. A joy to watch as a neutral Liverpool fan
Anthony Taylor masterclass as usual, should never be allowed to manage a chelsea game again bunch of fools
Ffs there’s always drama between Chelsea and spurs 😂
This Chelsea side could be something with a recognised 9  Edit: that’s not Lukaku
Embarrassing from the managers, type of stuff you see in a playground
That is absolute Gladiators of the London derby, Batman vs Superman of the London derby, Alien vs Predator of the London derby, WWE of the London derby or UFC of the London derby.
It would’ve been a much better game if Kane and Son weren’t playing like McShaminay and Trashford
So glad this ref is going to the World Cup. Let’s watch those namby pamby Latinas bawling all over the pitch when he lets play run PAAAAAHAHAHAHAHA REFEREEING PERFORMANCE OF THE YEAR
Love the passion, it’s what the game is all about.
Why did VAR look at it then  completely ignore the Chelsea player being pulled to the ground by the hair SHOCKING!
What's really funny, are all the Chelsea and Arsenal plastics crying on social media.
This is what makes the premiere league 👍
Everyone saying before the season started Tottenham will finish above chelsea. Not only does Chelsea’s performance prove that wrong but the limbs for an equaliser and Ryan Sessenyon gassing up the fans as if they’d won the game. Proves how much a draw means to them😂
What a spectacle that was, missed football, roll on the rest of tbe season
Those fancy london handbags are getting some good use 😆
The ref needs to be fired he can’t be a ref
The fight between conte and tuchel carried the game to make it so entertaining
Luvvvvvv da passion.... what a game! We need more of this in the PL
Why is conte getting mouthy  He would get folded
Tottenham first goal shouldn't have stood 😳
Gianni vio coming in clutch
Man Utd players need to watch this game.
It's good for the competition..this is top level elite sport. There has to be an edge. Sport is about entertainment...  It's like a Fast bowler charging in..or 2 props squaring up. Bring it on
This proves the real rivalry is between Spurs and Chelsea. Not the NLD with Arsenal. It's very personal between Spurs and Chelsea and the managers showed this.
Wonderful game Manager fight and gets carded Injury time winner for us Proper London Derby 🔥 *this* is the Premier League  Let’s hope we can beat em next time COYS 🤍🤍🤍
That passion from Tuchel when Reece James scored was amazing 🔥🔥🔥
1:18 3:08 thank me later
Arsenal will smoke them both. This isn't a rivalry. This is about how finishes 4th after Arsenal. Well done Spurs.
Anthony Taylor poor referee
Robbery
VAr need to explain why certain decisions are not overturned
That is what I want to see a bit of character, both managers sending messages to their teams fight fight fight! Both teams have something to prove l, again good to see.
can tell the commentator is chelsea fan 😂
What a game
Love the passion
How did Conte get booked for either “offence”. From what I saw, Tuchel started both
brilliant game and passion ... !!!
Wonder what azpillacueta was sayimg to his former manager at the end
Tuchel trying to boy off Conte was never going to go well 😂😂😂
How has koulibaly got better shooting the lukaku
Good result for arsenal 😉
I think the foul on Cucurella ( I think that is how you spell his name) had to be a foul but I am happy that entertainment is back
The amount spurs fans saying both goals should of stood shows how delusional that fan base is
The ref swapped his Chelsea shirt with Kane at the end
This is why chelsea need a striker,they would of scored a couple more.
Real football rivalries
Good news All the Spurs players joined in The Chavs went to their Bentleys
Chelsea haven't been robbed this badly at Stamford Bridge since the Barcelona game
Commentary for this is shocking , koulibably scores a worldly.. and all we get is a few seconds later  , 'well'..whatever happend to moments like  'ESSIen'
Delicate flowers 💐
No class in London
NOW THAT IS A LONDON DERBY!!
“And it’s finished, oh wait it hasn’t finished, it’s only just started” 😭😭🤣 the only good commentary the whole game, Martin just didn’t sound like he wanted to be there..
Super Sunday indeed passion from both managers was unreal
2 average teams
Grown men....apparently!
I LOVE THIS GAME! Its called the PREMIER League for a reason
Anyone else shouting on Conte?? lol :)
That game was the definition of robbery.
Balls
I expected more from Tottenham today. Chelsea were better team. Did well to dig in for the draw. 1st goal was class. Conte vs Tuchel would end with TKO for Conte.
I’ll take it spurs are a scary side if only Havertz finished his chances we’d have snatched it
Cannot stand Azpi
Gotta love the handbags 👜
Spurs paid the referee.. straight up robbery😂
Although we played poor conte has bought back the poch magic, conte carried them players today. What a class act big up Antonio 👏
We love to see it  🍿💯😭
To anyone complaining about celebrating a draw - I've seen Chelsea celebrate countless draws when they were the worse team for the majority of the game. The fact we snatched a point here where we were second best for 60 mins makes it even more enjoyable
That's the kind of passionate rivalry we love. None of Pep and Klopp's hugs and kisses....!!
Cmon these robberies are too common for the most viewed league. How can you not call foul on cucarellas hair pull. If it’s a fair game that final corner would never happen. It is what it is.
What we all want to see in football… passion
That’s what you called a derby well done to both managers
Loving the animosity between Conte & Tuchel, wish Klopp & Pep were more fiery 😂 good game of football too could have gone either both sides wasted chances though.
My team (spurs) didn't deserve to draw this game. Im disappointed lads
Lol
Sky sports choose not to show the blatant missed red card before Tottenhams second goal. Pathetic, Agenda much?
The salty tears from the Chelski fans is a beauty to behold.
Good game, slightly ruined by sexual tension of the two manager’s.. get a room
How can u be carded at the end of the game 😂
Not a chelsea fun but cant get over the fact they sole the club from its legitimate owner, shameful, disgraceful and immoral.
Very old men arguing and shouting having to be separated in case they have "a fall" 😅 This must be that Wetherspoons Stadium
This is what a derby looks like 👏
Arsenal ❤️
Put Conte and Tuchel on the undercard of the Joshua/ Usyk fight ...👊🥊🤭
Koulibaly’s finish was bloody lovely!
why was the hair pulling by the spurs player on the Chelsea player not shown??more incompetence by Antony Taylor
Chelsea where all over Spurs , not a Chelsea fan but how they did not win ??
We were so bad! So lucky to walk away with a draw especially with those decisions 😂
Tuchel is a baby. Crying because they gave up 2 goals and lost when they should’ve seen the game out much earlier
I'm an Arsenal fan feeling angry for Chelsea. That's how bad Anthony Taylor's refereeing was
Daylight robbery is a brutal crime
Anthony Taylor. Chelsea agenda again
Referring unsurprisingly poor from Taylor and VAR
Tyler, gutted that Spurs equalise at the end. Embarrassing old biased div.
Remember when fans and pundits thought Tottenham had overtaken Chelsea as a squad and was going to challenge for the title ? But instead they was totally dominated by Chelsea in this game and had to rely on the referee to help them get a draw. TERRIBLE refereeing in this game honestly. Chelsea was far the better team with their pressing and intensity and everything else. Tottenham have improved but they are still below Chelsea.
I feel for richarlison man, he was about to jump for a chest bump with Kane after the goal but got pied😭
Tbh spurs got better before Tottenham would have lost this game before
What a game
6 points deduction for both sides, they set up bad examples for younger generations, that is not a football.
Best premier league match I’ve watched in years
The fight has got more views than this
Chelsea got robbed
Great to see the passion from these managers and the events were certainly entertaining but equally so their behaviour on this occasion deserved red cards and I’m glad the ref had the conviction to do it. Two awesome teams and altogether well run clubs.
Premier Passion....Love it 👍
So much better when there are no female commentators
wow just wow  From a spurs fan
Every day wish we'd have hired Conte.
that.was.AMAZING.
All that was missing was Robbie savage.
2 horendous Decisions cost Chelsea the game with fouls
Bet spurs are so happy with 5his draw that they bring out a dvd of it
Hair pulling is a red card.
Just grow up the flipping lot of you, set an example for God's sake , shake hands and have done with it
Handbags at 50 paces
Forget about Tottenham and Arsenal fighting.  this was better
Chelsea dropping points at home after dominating possession and playing well... It's not spurs who should be concerned
First time in years I've seen passion like this with managers and players. Truly loving football recently. Bring on the rest of the season
conte and tuchel is great
I have seen enough to know this is Spurs year---they got fight in the belly, and they have the bench to turn a bad day, into a feisty affair on any ground anywhere....
What a game👏👏
Great game icl but we should’ve won 100% Refs weren’t on our side today.
Who cares. Neither of them will win the league.
Lets be honest. Conte would murder Tuchel
Tuchel is suffering from some type of a personality disorder. A very arrogant dude
Spurs second half was good
How petty and childish of tuchel, he tried to man grip conte and he was having none of it
United fans are depressed watching teams play good football hahahahaha
nothing really happened, over hyped , looks like publicity to me
COME ON YOU SPURS
Funny how the prem YT channel try to hide the refs mistakes but keep in the altercations between managers as it’s better TV
why didn't they show the foul on cucurella??? it was definitely btw even the spurs fans i know agreed that it was a foul and a red but the ref didn't give it ???
Conte didn’t do nothing it was all Thomas tuchal
biggest robbery ive ever seen
These referees are honestly so rubbish, yet no one does anything about them
Who is giving Taylor these big games? He’s the worst premier league ref going
Fergie V Wenger Part II
This is not a good example to set for kids playing football . I’m shocked that ex managers and footballers on sky  saying they want to see more of this as it’s entertaining. Football is entertaining not brawls .
The song Eye of the Tiger should have been playing in the background of the highlights. I applaud both teams, they went punch for punch until the final whistle and beyond.
Who needs womens football.
Tbf spurs and arsenal look good its gonna be a good season 👌 hopefully it's a 4 way between City Liverpool arsenal and spurs or even Chelsea. Champions league spots will be good. City Liverpool arsenal and spurs is my shout
Chelsea fans talking about being robbed when they've literally had dirty russian money buying them all their trophies over the last 20 years 🤣🤣🤣 oh the hypocrisy!!!
They must be so scared of spurs to dislike them that much or is it jealousy
tyler is a dead commentator now
That 3rd goal was exquisite what a touch 🤝
Spurs fans have a right to be excited with the draw and chelsea fans have the right to be let down, brilliant game of footy and poor refereeing from Anthony Taylor once again but that’s football
Spurs were lucky to get two assist from the referee. Thank you Mr Taylor .I.
Tuchel showing the same terrible attitude that got him the hoof from pretty much every club he's managed.
Pulling a players hair some how doesn’t even count as a yellow card,at least?!
I'd really like to see the professional foul removed from the game. Any foul above the waste should be an automatic red. Years ago rules like 'level is onside' 'no back pass' were introduced to put the game in favour of the strikers and more exciting... Changes for the better... teams used to wind the clock down by passing it repeatedly back into the keepers hands.. that changed to sheilding the ball in the corner flag... it's pathetic and unsporting... Reece James - Hands around the shoulders dragging players down, is deliberate, intentional, unsporting and players deserve to be sent off and issued match bans for it. They're unsporting behaviour will soon change.
get this JORGINHO GUY OFF
Am i the only one who saw Bentancur actually played the ball against Havertz? And Mendy could deffo see past Richarlison for the first goal. Other than that the ref was poor
Oh yesssssss
Betancur got the ball against Havertz so no foul
Wow actual passion 👏
Hope Boris and his Spurs loving cabinet are happy
Nice to see that passion from both managers ❤️
Love both managers more now lol 😆 😂 🤣
Dunno why tuchel is saying look me in the eyes when he wasn’t looking at conte either lol
Chelsea were all over spuds so the ref had to help. Anthony Taylor needs sacking.
I sense a Sky Sports Compilation video about Angry Managers coming soon.
Its only in the premier league adults behave like children.
This game was 1 red card for who tackled Jorginho and one for havertz.Also the score should have been Chelsea 2 - 0 Spurs
make me laugh these managers and players want all the fans to behave like nuns and they do what they want
Great game, Chelsea dominated, managers fighting, spurs got lucky to get a point
BEST LEAGUE IN THE WORLD!
How can anyone even consider spurs to be a top 4 team. Kane is absolutely tragic and son goes missing in big games. Embarrassing
What is Jorginho doing just get rid of it he’s cost his team here
As great as this game one, Martin Tyler for the last goal………
How Anthony Taylor is still allowed to officiate Chelsea games is honestly beyond me
Good job sky not showing the red for romero
I’m a Liverpool fan and this was a great game to watch
Not gna show cucurella getting his skull yanked off?
Don't f with Conte, Tuchel you don't want it. Trust me.
Tuchel is such a Conte.
Conte got tacitly outclassed unlucky decisions by the ref not surprised it’s Anthony Taylor few more signings and we’ll be set like the intensity from the team
How the FA can watch stuff like this and keep Anthony Taylor and Mike Dean in a job is beyond me
Lmao
This is what the premier league is about 🔥🔥
Now this is what we wanna see
This is why Premier league is by far the best league on the planet.
What a game. But red card for romero was missing. And the 2 spurs goal shoul've been disallowed because he "romero" pushed cucurella's hair😤
Conte and Tuchel. To the death!
Spurs were lucky to get a point
I don't understand why people think bentancur tackle on havertz was a foul.The man clearly touched the ball with his toes. The reply shows that and yet people still think its a foul🤦‍♂️
i wouldnt want to mess with conte he looks like a mafia hitman
They’re both gonna get fined but they make bare money so they should keep beefing
Koulibaly did a kool volley 😁
What a game! The new rules letting the game flow more really providing more exciting open matches and I'm all for it. Gonna be a season to remember
What a great game proper derby this was
Sterling getting out of the way of the ball is the best thing he's ever done.
This is what we love to see! Passion! Can you even imagine Ten Hag doing that....?
Not going to show the Romero incident with Cucurella in to make it look like spurs deserved it? Typical sky
How is the first goal not offside or a foul? What is VAR there for? He is clearly standing in front of the keeper and the ball almost hits him
Hugo's save. Kouliballer's volley. PEH's sliced finish. Reece james's cross for the sitter. Stirling's weighted assist. Perisic's delivery.  Delight of a game.
What a sunday this has been …. Im a liverpool fan and the forest west ham game was brilliant   Chelsea spurs game brilliant 👌👌 PREMIER LEAGUE IS BACK!
Guess this is about as close as spurs have gotten to a trophy in years so it makes sense that they'd celebrate in that manner.. good for them :)
Love ❤️ Conte
Good to know hair pulling is allowed in football now gonna be pulling that trick out on a Sunday from now on 👌
Referee was so so bad, and I don't even support Chelsea
koulibalys goal is just different gravy
the fact everyone is overlooking the blatent corruption because it's "vintage barclays" is disgraceful
Ref should never be allowed any where the premier league ever again,inept,biased just a joke
Imagine lukaku was here to see his tuchel and conte fight 😂
2 managers exchange prolonged eye contact, shake hands aggressively and argue a bit and both get red carded, kind of pathetic..
Why do Spurs always get away with dirty challenges? Both of their goals started with fouls!
Disgusting Scenes by both Managers who should be setting an example to their players.
Modern football is so trash. Spurs 1st was offside, clearly interfering with play. The managers really should lose their jobs for such disgraceful behaviour.  It is certainly not sport. Such a shame because the players show great skill but who wants to watch when it is marred by corruption and ugly behaviour?
Battle of the bridge is still ongoing...
Tottenham 1st goal was offside.The player was in offside in the direction of the shoot....Even if the goalkeeper could not reach that ball..should be offside!You just can avoid the ball by 10 cm..but the view of the goalkeeper was obstructionated!
Chelsea kinda got robbed, from my personal opinion.  We're was the highlight on the VAR decision, why not show that ? It's because ........
Tuchel vs Conte Anthony Taylor + Spurs vs Chelsea  Why is Cucurella foul not in the highlights? That was one of the worst decisions I've ever seen
Chelsea got robbed
This Heat is making the premiere League exciting everyone fuming 😂😂
Can I just state a point of view; love that the women won the euros but I want to hear men who’ve played at the highest level give their views, Karen, Alex et al make valid points and understand the game but so do I, and I played for Barnes Albion reserves 30 years ago. (and that is a much higher level than the women’s game - simple biology) Would rather hear Keano and Neville etc. Can’t women analyse the women’s game and men do ours - isn’t that equality? Just saying...
I watched the game and I broke my throat at the last second
Romeros a cheat
1:18 touched got so mad cause Chelsea conceded a goal 😂
Got to love both managers passion.....especially tuchel as a chelsea fan. Loved his reaction to the reece James goal! football needs has/needs moments where they can display character and emotion, hence the clash between conte and tuchel. Adds even more to the heated rivalry!
The rivalry is back in London
This is real football, this is real competition. This is what the fans pay for...
Deduct points for the managers behaviour
A 4-Goal draw, both managers get sent off for having a go a each other, in a game between Chelsea & Tottenham.........and no Mourinho in sight?????????  Bout time we get a new spicy manager rivalry........As a neutral, I'm so hyped for February 23rd.
2 good teams ,2 passionate coaches, take note Man Utd.
I dont know what everyone else thinks but, l’ve noticed that Harvertz is costing us a lot of goals ngl. I get it he won the UCL for us but he’s really struggling up front. He clearly has no idea what to do with the ball. It’s either he shoots from an impossible position to score or he misses the vital chances we get. My honest opinion is he’s weakening our attack and he’s just another timo. I rest my case
ngl im a villa fan but conte could knock out tuchel
Passionate players and coaches…. United should take a note
Gotta get Tuchel vs Conte on the undercard of Joshua vs Usyk
Proper Derby match.
I would of loved this game as a chelsea fan but Anthony Taylor ruined it
Perfect result for arsenal 😁
The managers are a TOTAL disgrace Thank God for  Graham Potter are sensible calm manager at a VERY WELL RUN  club BHA
Join me in the drive by we gonna dip Anthony Taylor like to join 👍
By the way didn’t even show Romeros hair pull😂😂😂
HARRY KANE
This ref always. Always has it in for chelsea. Enough is enough !
Spurs v Chelsea are always great games.
3:08 Tuchel to Conte “Nice wig”
A proper rivalry unlike city v Liverpool
Corrupt refereeing must be called out in the English game this ref has been called out by Chelsea 6 times prior asking him not to be in charge of our games how many times can we ask . Then you give us Mike Dean in VAR corruption must be stamped out of this game
COYS
Chelsea still finding their scoring boots spurs got lucky they where blown away Part 2 should be great a festival in its self
Awesome 2:38 Harry Kane He got it ⚽️
Tuchel doing the good old hold me back ahaha
Spurs and their small club mentality lol. So much for all their hope lol. Chelsea reminding them of their place again.
Can we just scrap English refs and outsource, these guys are dusted
How was Richarlison trying to claim that😂😂
fine them a years wages and ban them for 10 matches
Chelsea look good
Still only beaten Chelsea twice in 30 years! You could have Saudi money and still not win, at some point it’s just sad 😂
Hard for to watch this as I follow Spurs and Chelsea equally and hate seeing either lose. Chelsea surprised me with how well they played considering the upheaval and disruption they have had and was pleased with that. Spurs on the other hand another dismal display , weak passing for the most part and losing the ball too easily, overrun and out passed. Spurs as a team seem to blow hot and cold , great one week and mediocre the next. Ignoring any quibbles about this and that from others here Chelsea deserved this match by a long way and Spurs very lucky to come away with a point. Still, it's early days yet and we need a few weeks for teams to get back into the groove and slog of the hardest league in the world of football. Gonna be a few more rattles yet as we have already seen with Man.U. and West Ham , could be a fun season hopefully.
seriously, how is the pull on the hair not a foul...? if that's allowed then they need to cut their hair...so confused how it's not a foul...
Many people knew this would be an exiting game and it lived up to that expectation
credit to spurs but anthony taylor with yet another horror show, romero pulling cucurella’s hair before the corner they scored from and a clear foul on havertz before the hojbjerg goal that they didn’t bother to VAR check. Real shame for Chelsea.
I love how everyone is trying to split them at the end. Like what is going to happen? Football players do it all the time. They act hard knowing very well no one is going to throw the punch. Stupid
Ref is pathetic
Passion, skill what a great game well done both teams 👍
2-1 goal is like acting they won the premier league lool
Best game of the season so far ..
This game is already a certified Premier league classic.
What happens when managers get red cards?
Yes Chelsea dominated us without a doubt @ Stamford Bridge, but against all odds...we clawed ourselves back in the game, not once... but twice. Last season we'd have lost this 2-0 with ease 😊
Chelsea dominated us but a point is a point. Persic looking alright. Son and Kulu were quiet. Midfield not strong enough still.
Now now children!
2 managers acting like children. Embarrassing.
Tuchel and Conte holding hands longer than the whole twighlight series put together 😂
chelsea were robbed should of been a foul first  goal and second goal romero yanked cucerellas hair back
Why does carragher sound different when commenting
Disgusting refereeing performance from Anthony Taylor. And how could Mike Dean look at that deliberate hair pull on Cucurella on a video screen, in slow motion, with all the angles, and think there’s nothing wrong with it?!?! Absolutely disgraceful from those referees!
Big point considering how bad spurs were. Awful all over the park
👜
Forget ksi vs swarmz I wanna see conte vs tuchel
Actually a disgrace how the last goal was not ruled out for a foul on Cucurella, there is no doubt that it was a foul so how was it not called?
the Chelsea manager acting far more more provocative  than conte
what the point of having VAR if id doesn't do anything
I only watched this highlight just to see Tuchel and Conte.
Not gonna lie, Chelsea, Spurs, and Arsenal, all look very dangerous this season 👀. Will be great to see how they fair against City and Liverpool, and see if they can start to close the gap on those 2.
This is what I like to see
Awful performance by the ref. How can pulling someone's hair and dragging him down to the floor not be a foul?
Foul and handball in the build up to the first. Foul in the build up before the corner on the second goal. Chelsea 2 Tottenham 0(FA 2).
Tuchel is basically Israel here claiming conte started it even though everyone can see he did.
As a fan of football I'm loving this season already lol
I think the premier league started today, the other games were just a  pre-season...
Pride of London = CHELSEA
I dont know what everyone else thinks but, l’ve noticed that Harvertz is costing us a lot of goals ngl. He missed a lot of chances in the Everton match and this one too. He had no idea of what to do with the ball. It’s either he shoots from an impossible angle to score or he misses important chances we get. I don’t think he deserves to be in this squad. I rest my case
1:18 , 3:08 The Don vs The Führer
Tommy Tickles has lost his mind!
Conte won’t be at Tottenham for long. I tell you that.
The best League in the World.
Are you not entertained!!!   I love it!!!
What a game. This is the best league in the world and it ain’t close!!
Absolute classic bridge derby! Goals, fights , red cards it had everything love to see it as a Liverpool fan🔴🔴🔴
man u to win the league...
Great to see so many English players on the pitch.
Chelsea rattled! Blaming the ref and VAR 🤣🤣
If we get Ronaldo we can win the premier league 👍🏼😃
Robbed how Anthony Taylor is still referring I will never know. Straight red card we should of won.
Lol
VAR loves to pick and choose decisions. Poor performance from the ref.
Reffs in the prem are actually shocking 😳
Big ups to the bald head goon that tried to stop the beef but ended up bouncing the back of his head against the camera
We had a bad game but still got a point.. reality check.. work in progress.. COYS
Kante and Sterling together could be dangerous uno. Never thought of it
What's more hilarious seeing Richarlison out of his depth or watching kane blank him in the celebration hahahahaha
Need more of that between managers. Nowadays they all kiss each other after the match. Bring back the mourinho v wenger hatred
Don't support either team but chealse got robbed Havertz Foul was the clearest foul and how did chealse not get free kick for cucurella getting pulled down by hair
Only one team in London with 4 European cups , levels
Chelsea bottle jobs lol
The number of dodgy decisions given to chelsea against spurs over the years isn't going to leveled up by a non foul like the one today.
Am I the only one that hates Tuchel? Haha
chelsea are always giving out then spurs are always shouting and im a brentford fan
Really thought we were gonna win screw Kate for getting a 96th min goal
Battle of the bridge 2
Chelsea need to buy Ronaldo. We need a finisher. We can’t keep relying on Haverts. Please Chelsea please but Ronald or zapata please Chelsea please
As Dave " Harry " Bassett said handbags at 5 paces
i bloody love it when managers fall out, some people say its a disgrace i absolutley love the passion.
hate Tuchel with a passion, even more so now UTV!🦁💪
What a game that’s all I’m going to say !!!
Prime Barclays right here
Daylight robbery and absolute shocking referee
as a neutral fan chelsea deserved the win ten times over it was a great game as a neutral but the second goal shouldnt of been allowed to happen shouldve been a free kick
Romero couldn't help himself after that second goal 😂😂😂
imagine shipping off lukaku just to get him back at CB lol what a finish
Cheating refs should be fired on the spot what part of hair pulling can u not see lmao wxxxxrs  they really are.2 fouls hand balls etc 2 goals we done the yids right up.and they needed help from the refs jokers
As a spurs man we didn't deserve anything but hey that's football
Prime Barclays
Liverpool fan but loved every second of this!! Especially the Barney between the managers 🤣
Nothing like the prem. oh yeah baby.
Robbery
Let them fight it out like in ice hockey !!!!,
Tottenham Hotsvar, 100% a foul in the build up to the goal
Only martin Tyler could make a 96th minute equaliser sound underwhelming
Good set piece from the 2 new signings for the 1st goal. What a finish.
Hahah as if Richarlison tried to claim the goal
The way Richarldson tried to claim that goal💀💀
Embarrassing children need to grow up
4 goals scored  Harry Kane scoring 90+6 min  both managers red 🔴 carded  what a game this was! 1
Martin Tyler screaming for every Chelsea goal and could barely muster an ounce of excitement for the last minute equalizer.  This is why Sky are becoming irrelevant and other broadcasters are making them look pathetic. When the Americans are doing a better job of football punditry and commentary then you know Sky are biased garbage.
Soprano’s style finish, Italian jobs got the fire 🔥 good 👍
Chelsea's Fans, do you still love Conte?
I wish Conte and Tuchel had a hug instead of a handshake. Would have been much funnier ! Sure ManU manager would kill for the same sort of concerns right now...
For city, arsenal fans: just entertainment
Manager's setting a good example to kids.
Tottenham drew because of a blatantly wrong decision and a technical loophole.
Carra's loving it
Don't like handbags but on derby day I don't mind things boiling over.
Classic spurs Chelsea game. One of the most heated fixtures in the country
It’s reason English Premiership are best in the world.
ah, gammon football is back. pride of England 🙄
Conte's Tottenham is a different animal and even though we played poorly today, this was a huge case of- if you can't win the match, don't lose it!
Funny how the Tottenham players thought Richarllison scored 😂😂😂😂
Love the premier league
I Love Conte. Passion. Desire to get a result no matter what. People can and will say. This behaviour was a bad thing. Which is your point of view. I loved this. If i was a spurs player that would pump me up like crazy for the next game.
Reece James o.g ?
I really enjoyed that game. It had everything. This is why the Premiership is the best and most exciting league in the world.
Same story from last season, Bottlejobs can only get wins and points against the big sides when the officials gift them penalties and other favours. They are just the English Juventus, without the trophies obviously.
The cheer from Chelsea from the second goal
is it just me or was the bentancur tackle a totally fair one? I know he only gets a smidge of the ball but it's a vital touch and he's clearly playing the ball. forget that it was multiple phases away from the goal, it wasn't even a foul in my eyes
Refs clearly lost the plot, and spurs celebrate like they won champion league . 🥴
A London derby isn't a derby without Tottenham
Martin Tyler voice drops when Hojberg scores. So biased.
Mate don't talk to me about football needing to be without these rows for kids. This was amazing and exactly what the start of the season needed. This season is going to be HUGE!!!!
Chelsea were so wasteful they can’t blame the ref for this
Wheres romero’s hair pull that is a red card 100% of the time🤦🏽‍♂️
Forget the game, these referee's are atrocious.
Expect nothing less of Anthony Taylor
Chelsea robbed
Taylor and var was an absolute disgrace.
what a game this was, it had everything 🔥
GAME OF THE SEASON COYS
Anthony Taylor was jealous of Curuculela’s hair, so decided pulling hair is not a foul.
Chelsea fans are crying - nature is healing!
What an absolutely fantastic game. Brilliant all round
Commentator said That “foul” on Havertz, he got the ball.
Conte and Tuchel 😂
Refreshing to see in this day and age. Passion and desire.
Got to say, brilliant game but I think that first equaliser has to be disallowed. Richarlison is miles offside and clearly in the keeper's eyeline. But I have no issues with the managers showing a bit of passion
so glad there was no female commentator on this. it would have literally killed the moment
Is there anything in the rules of football about hair pulling? 🤔
I rate Chelsea spurs rivalry more then NLD
Two things that are just beyond belief. One how on earth is Richarlison not interfering with play for the spurs first goal and how on earth did the var ref not think Romeros yanking of Cucurellas hair wasn't a red card offence and how  did the ref miss it in the first place. That was outrageous and Chelsea were robbed by the var ref and filthy play by Romero.
A point against Anthony Taylor , i think most Chelsea fans would have taken that before the game .
I'm a Liverpool fan, but I love Antonio Conte. He doesn't give a damn, he will give it to you, in your face.
Oh my god that late goal from kane
Tuchel's got the advantage with reach, but Conte got more power... shame it got split up
What a good this day and age with var and they turn a blind eye every time in these moments it makes a joke of the system like what the point having someone watch this and review it and think that’s totally ok where can I sign up to be a official so I can show theses jokesters how a far game works!!!!
What a derby game
Anthony Taylor should never be in charge of a football game
James's finish was a bit wonky 😄
You don’t get this energy, vibe and emotion in the womens game. Despite what the BBC try to force on people.
What a goal by Koulibaly though😳
This is what we've missed. Spurs doing a victory lap for getting a point at the bridge
My Gosh....🙌🙌
The cobbblerssssssss....
Captain Kane!!!!
Thee is more space there than there is at Hyde park!
Welcome to the premier league 💯💯
Taylor's vs van Barnevald round 2. Ding ding. Clearly swapping shirts wasn't enough. What larks. What a great way to spend a hot afternoon.
The Premier League has to be the best in the world 🌎 of football.
Conte and tuchel bout to scrap
when i was watching this game the thomas tuchel and antonio conte fight was legendary
Who will finish higher out of these two..? Answers on a post card
It’s a definite foul Bentacur. He gets more Havertz than the ball, clear foul
Corner kickers have no reason to raise their arm.Everyone can see what's happening.
This is what competitive football is about. Get these pair with Klopp and Arteta in a ring and we have a brawl
Great game from ref I don't know what people are complaining about
They don’t show what happened to cucurella during that corner no🤔
What a couple of big girls blouses, I mean really
chelsea crying on twitter is the funniest thing I've seen all year
Don’t think I’ve ever seen a worse refereeing performance, it’s obvious at this point Anthony Taylor doesn’t like Chelsea
Did anyone notice richarlison try to celebrate with Kane and then Kane just ran past him
Just ban Taylor
Tuchel reminds me of a snotty teenager
Tuchel is such a ❄️. You were the better team by far, sure. But you got done, take it like a man.
Tuchels a small fish in a big pond
Spurs were second best all game and still got a point. This is what Conte brings to this new Spurs, a doggedness
I don't know who looked worse today honestly both Chelsea and Spurs look mentally and physically unready I think man utd will still make top 4 easily. Yes you can banter Manchester United but its still very early days and ETH is still finding his feet and there's still time left of the window and Ronaldo looks like he's staying, once ten hag settles in and figures out his best eleven and gets the players playing his style of football I think we'll start flying up the table. There's a still a long hard road ahead of us and I never said it wa going to be easy but when you have teams like Chelsea and spurs competing with you for top 4 there's really not that much competition I'm confident we will finish 3rd. COME ON UTD!!!
Managers got red not some of these players is mad to me
THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW, COME ON YOU SPURS
Perfect result as a Gooner, both teams drop 2 points
As a Chelsea fan I am proud of the way we performed and we 100% deserved those 3 points. If it wasn't for: - Anthony Taylor being blind and bald - Cucurella being assaulted and Havertz being taken down - VAR having 0 knowledge on what fouls are
Martin retire please
Missed the premier league glad it’s back
Been some crazy games so far.
I find myself siding with Chelsea
Martin Tyler needs to retire, 96th minute equaliser and that’s his reaction? What happened to him man. He was more excited for Reece James goal in the 77th minute.
how that hair pulling wasnt a red is so crazy..
man I love london football (I don't care for crystal palace)
For a first sky highlights longer than 3mins
Ngl spurs first goal should’ve been disallowed
In fairness, we (tottenham fan) were dreadful but we always are at the bridge. Glad to see us nick a point, something we cant usually do away to Chelsea, good things for our season.
That was some battle. The football match was okay, too.
This is what we need. Passion. Fire. All fair and forgotten after the match
Premier League 30 Years 🎉🎉🎉 Don’t you just love it 😍
Got them both with the old superglue on the hand trick
when are sky sports going to start putting the time in the highlights
What a game Chelsea and a spurs always seem to provide amazing games and I think  tuchel and klopps German aggression is so entertaining to watch 😂😂
Robbery!
the prem is a joke with these officials
Martin Tyler ' Or has it finished?' Lol great commentary
The players should have not jumped in I wanted to see a punch up between the managers decider who ever got knocked out would have lost the game
6 mins of added time is honestly ridiculous
Lucky lucky spuds.
Chelsea trying their best to creat a rivalry as they don’t have a proper rivalry haha
That will feel like a loss to Chelsea.
We stole a point, and I'm happy
And it's finished... it hasn't finished, it's only just started! Great commentating by Martin Tyler.
Loooool Tuchel what a guy
Thomas Tuchel is a disgrace.
can see who really wants it this year..... these 2 clubs .. .. ..
Typical Anthony Taylor match. Keep this up just cancel sport subscriptions. Premier league needs to sort it.
If only havertz and sterling scored those easy goals then this wouldnt have been a shambolic of a match 🤣. But the drama was worth it ngl
What a game! The fight between Tuchel and Conte made it even better 🤣
Hand bags and the Glad rags
Great game as a neutral but anthony taylor ruined it
BENTANCUR GOT THE BALL
Kane left Richarlison hanging haha.
Rigged game as alwats
Good result from all the top 6 this week as on arsenal fan and only 2games in. Lovly stuff.
Showed the two Havertz chances but not the Kane and Son chances
Typical of Chelsea to start complaining.  Brilliant game though.
Disgraceful officiating
Dam! It's WAR!
This was like a game from the 90s full of passion aggression proper old school stuff loved it
Romero is too funny
Conte my least favourite chelsea manager after that
New major rivalry
Chelsea deserved this win sm dodgy ref someone please check him
Great game. The ref was superb. Bentancur on Havertz was never a foul. Solid decision. Cucurella hair was pulled but off the ball incidents happen all the time. Part of the game. If it’s not a hair pull it’s a cheeky elbow or kick of the ankle. Get on with it
Best league in the world has the worst referees on earth. Var is just another tool to cheat
Tuchel vs Conte 😮
Would be an interesting rivalry developing between the managers if conte doesn’t throw his toys out the pram and leave before the next fixture
Great game, spurs with Harry Kane can finally win the premiership
conte would smash him
These highlights are a joke, sky sports have dropped off massively. Missing so many key points of the game, joke.
You’ve literally missed out the cucurella Moment you are so anti chelsea
It’s always Chelsea vs Spurs that blows up isn’t it 😂
Martin Tyler needs to calm down on Spurs’ 2nd goal. No need to go that crazy…
Next seasons opener I think
This is why we love football! WHAT A GAME!
Such a fake handshake for the cameras
Ref was bang in today had alot to deal with but let the game flow n what a game.
Conte v Tuchel is a better rivalry than Klopp v Guardiola
Listen, Man United might not thank me but get the contract out, put it on the table. Let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there, given what he's done since he's come in. TEN HAG'S (Ole 4.0) at the wheel, man. He's doing it. He's doing his thing. MAN UNITED ARE BACK!!!!!!!
Chelsea were robbed.
Smh Chelsea Got robbed
Sick volley from Koulibaily, shame we switched of at the end and threw away the 3 pts, childish from Tuchel and Conte, just shake hands and move on
The duck egg blue collar on the Chelsea shirt looks cheap. What’s going on with our football kits. Get back to basics for gods sake. Other than that, love the hand bags at the end.
Chelsea always start rows.Ive watched it no less than 15 to 20 times That's 4 times against Spurs. I'm not a fan of either. I watched Chelsea play against Liverpool, Man Utd , Man City  and Arsenal they cant take it. Simple as.
Let's be honest ..we love to see it. Nothing like a bit of argy bargy and passion to get the blood flowing. It's what football is all about
Disgraceful officiating that needs to be investigated
If I was as incompetent at my job as Anthony Taylor I’d be fired tomorrow. How is he still officiating matches? He has absolutely robbed Chelsea today, and I dislike Chelsea as much as anyone
Celebrity boxing match with Abramovich as referee
Chelsea got rob
Why did the managers get like that , what was the controversy I missed the end
The best League in the world is back!
Feel like Conte didn't do much wrong on the first yellow and the final one? bit odd
Mind blowing that the second goal was allowed, Cucarella literally dragged to the ground by his hair directly in front of the ref. The ref even stopped the game and then just carried on.
Ref should never Ref again and i do not follow Chelsea or Spurs but Ref had Spurs top on for sure shocking
Cracking advert for the premier league, not that it needs any 👍
What a game. Proper drama and emotions. Fantastic 👍
Nothin better than a spurs smash n grab at the bridge ☺️.
Antony Taylor the worst ref ever
Leicester were the winners but for no reason
I’m a neutral but hot blooded Conte would dog walk Tuchel 🤷🏽‍♂️
Chelsea are has beens. And they know it. Russian oil money gone. Club will decline from 2022 onwards.
The worst officiating in PL match I’ve ever seen
The way Spurs and Conte conducted themselves reminded me so much of old school Chelsea and Mourinho. Didn’t necessarily play well but made it a brawl and got the smash and grab. Spurs definitely wouldn’t have shown that attitude 12 months ago
brilliant game of football, thought the linesman's and VAR were poor. should of been a foul on Kai before their first goal and the hair pulling before the last corner should of been a foul too.  happy with the performance, shame we can finish the game off when we are so dominant.
When both managers fight I don’t understand why the whole team has to get involved
👜 's at dawn 😂
This is a bad ref spoiled a good game and ďont know way always Chelsea has to suffer the injustice sorry but the through
Watch Thomas Tuchels post match interview and it’ll pretty much some up everything you need to know about this game, Harry Kane even said they didn’t deserve anything
Koulibaly > Virgil
Tuchel would have him. Easy.
its da history of da chelsiiiee
Aspas a legend
It's not even been a third through the season and this match could already be match of the season 😮
Great game however Chelsea was clearly robbed!!
Ohh... OHHHHH!!!  ohhhh  OHHHH
For me Antonio shouldn’t have gotten a red. At the end of the game, both managers received reds when Tuchel was already on a yellow. Plus it was Tuchel who stirred it up by not letting go of Conte’s hand yet Conte got punished more for that incident despite not having received a yellow already🤨
They are cheering like they’re winning some kind of competition. Chelsea fans cheer like Leeds fans except you don’t hear drums banging at Elland Road. Sometimes we bang drums that’s normally at away games
We definitely need a number number 9 as soon as possible
Havertz looking like Hazard with that trim
John Terry would of banged Contes missis for that disrespect
Conte didn't really do anything wrong tho
Spurs can be devastating but this game they were lacklustre
Chelsea can't take it...lol
Fun fact did wach this live
Daylight robbery if I’ve ever seen it. And I’m not even a Chelsea fan.
It was Tuchel who didn't let go of Conte's hand during the handshake. Most likely because he's frustrated with Tottenham's late  equaliser.
Missed the premier league so much these past two months. Glad to have it back. English football is peak domestic sports entertainment.
Anthony Taylor needs to be sacked! Utter rubbish!
There's always drama whenever Chelsea play Tottenham. They are always great games to watch 👀🍿.
That was not a foul on Havertz. Spurs player touched the ball by a fraction.
Ooh how the ladies euros is well and truly forgotten,  sorry ladies this is football.
Look at Arsenal celebrating like they won the league…        Oh wait- that’s spuds and they didn’t even win… 🙄
As an outsider who has no affiliation to any of the London teams... this rivalry between Chelsea and Tottenham feels way more intense than the North London Derby.
None of spurs goals should have been allowed to stand. Every time a new season starts there's always hope that the  officials will do their jobs properly but once again this isn't the case. The level of refereeing is still atrocious. To pull someone's hair like that and get away with it is absolutely disgusting. They need to remember that kids watch football too. All these idiots are teaching them is that it's okay to go up to someone and drag them to the floor by grabbing their hair. It's disgusting. Spurs are dirty cheats and their players will hopefully get what's coming to them
If during a game in the Premier League you complain about having your hair pulled, you should be playing in the WSL
👜 👜👜
Sky leaving out Cucurella being pulled to the ground by the hair, the corner before the goal. Blatant foul not given and it cost chelsea 3 points.
🤣 Handbags 👜 at 50 paces.
1:43 when did Calfreezy join Chelsea?
Conte went for a genuine handshake despite the earlier kerfuffle. What a nasty piece of work Tuchel is.
Havertz & Tuchel vs Romero and Conte
Yes the prem is back fire🔥no injuries good to no players fight on the pitch and in the dug out yeahhh let's go.😂
It was a great match but as a Chelsea fan, it was definitely a bit angering to see the hair pull being ignored, therefore leading to the equaliser. Not being biased, Chelsea dominated today. Hopefully in the future we can prevent other teams from picking up undeserved points. It is what it is though. Excited for the upcoming games!  💙
What a game, not even a neutral and this was the best game I’ve watched in years, late drama, touchline fights, football is back for now (Tottenham fan)
In Perisic we finally have someone who can take a corner its a miracle
Battle of the bridge is back!
Wow, what a goal from a central defender!
Conte hates Chelsea he's always trying to take his anger out on them grow up mate be proffesional
Coys
S*urs cheating again as per
Great game to watch but foreboding for Man Utd supporters. Either one of them would obliterate Man Utd, looking more and more like a relegation battle.
Exciting match
Chelsea outplayed spurs today from a lfc fan but they got unlucky with the result . What a shame
Tuchel nearly broke Conte's arm! Tuchel was bang out of order
Refs are so corrupt lol
Chelsea have the right feel angry at that first goal. 100% A foul on Havertz
Tottenham goals shldnt have counted: 1. Kai Havertz was fouled during the build up 2. Richarlison was offside he even was blocking Mandy’s view 3. Romero shld have seen a red card for pulling Cucurella’s hair before the second goal 4. How none of Spurs midefildera didn’t get a yellow card is shocking - Bentancur gave fouls away so many times  I’m not a bitter Chelsea fan but we should have won that game we were clearly robbed by Anthony Taylor and VAR. He shldnt be allowed to referee our games cause this isn’t the first time of he’s stupidity. Yh Havertz and Sterling shld have took the chances earlier on but still were robbed. Plus who doesn’t love the Tuchel-Conte fight🤣🤣🤣
Inject the tears
Tuchel so emotional 😆
Referee and VAR robbed chelsea the win
People need to stop disrespecting tuchel by saying conte is a better manager tichel as conte number spurs had to pat a ref to ignore hair pulling and a fould on havertz spurs should have never scored does two goals.
“There’s more space there than there is at Hyde Park!” - Pure Partridge.
Spurs were underwhelming but if it wasn’t for Anthony Taylor both of spurs goals should’ve never stood
What a game
Nice to see people who care.
Love the passion from both managers ‼️
Paul Tierney must have been on VAR today
We didn’t play well at all, lacked the ability to take the ball when being pressed, but we kept fighting and got the point in the end. Sometimes you just have to grind it out and we did that.   Arsenal are supposed to be our biggest rivals, but I don’t hate them the way I do Chelsea. The team and Conte showing we don’t back down 😤
Should of been 2-0 chelsea while spurs shouldn't of had their goals we didn't take our chances even though we had all the ball so I can't complain
Conte, pétulante pup as usual
Conte is a disgrace to football. Plays for a draw. Ain’t gonna win nothing conte
🤣🤣🤣🍿🍿🍿
I wonder who held whose hand at the end. It looked like it was Tuchel, but I think it was Conte
Chelsea team built up on Russian money with blood on their hands....
Grabbing someone by the hair and throwing them on the ground is no foul. Veryyyyy interesting
why couldn't Carragher jog on to management, his opinions are just rubbish just bin the whole script until these old farts fade into the background. Also was the pulling of to violent to show or what? say a lot if that was the case.
Tuchel was a disgrace. Absolutely rattled. Holding onto Antonio’s hands like that and pointing at his eyes! Hahahahahagagagshshshshhshshsgs  Antonio !!! Antonio!!!!!!! Antonio ! Antonio! Antonio!!!!!
Spurs had a good window, but the signing of Anthony Taylor is absolutely brilliant!
Daylight robbery
I’ll take the draw we bossed spurs, 16 shots 3 on target. We need aubameyang and de jong and fofana. We need to put those chances away spurs will be happy with that. Still can’t beat us at the bridge 😂
Did more happen than shown? Feels a little over the top to send them both off for an aggy handshake. Maybe more because of the chaos it caused 🤔
Hahahaha. The end reminded me of Arteta vs Klopp last season. HOLD ME BACK!! HOLD ME BACK!!!!!!!
Come on u spurs
This is what i like to see in football people caring about the result.
Not only is the Referee right in front of the Romero and Cucurella hair pulling incident - VAR doesnt even give the right decision when it is so blatantly clear that it is a red card and a Chelsea free kick, which would mean that Spurs don't score that late equaliser - how they havent given that is mad.
Noticed how they didnt show the blatant foul/assault on cucurella that wasnt given and lead to the second Tottenham goal
The funny thing is when watching this live, I didn’t see who scored the header and I thought it was Richarlison cause it looked like he was celebrating 😂 .
The managers😂😂😂
Chelsea vs Tottenham is the BIG London derby nowadays. No disrespect to Arsenal but they are third in the pecking order nowadays.
Epic game
By the way where is your champions league trophy ?
Hair pulling is allowed in premier league.
As a chelsea fan we got robbed ..that hair pulling last min should off been a foul and red card ...spurs cheating and there celebrating a draw like a champions league trophy hahahahaha ... you spurs is a disgrace
Biggest fix ever ….. just waiting for spurs to score before blowing the whistle
coys
Neither of Spurs goals should have stood
This game never disappoints two top managers going back and fourth like it was WWE the goals the prem is back man that Anthony Taylor guy had a howler of a game some funny decisions.
The chels did well against a team of 15 today
This rivalry is heating up 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Get out of jail card used. Ten hag yet to use his.
What a game back and forth a manager fight and possible red cards unbelievable this is why we watch the premier league
And Tuchel was to blame for both flair ups and should have had a card for coming way out of his technical area.
Tuchel outclassed Conte and Chelsea got robbed.
At last some grudge in the Prem.  So bored of everyone being so nice.  We need more tunnel incidents and things to look back on in a decade.
Where is this hair pull
Cucurella deserved it after smacking Kulu constantly Romero never forgets
Why didn’t you show the blatant foul on Cucurella??? Romero should have got a red card.
Very good match  very skillfully played
Love the passion in this game, we could use a bit at old trafford.
Arsenal are the real winners of the weekend
Going to be another great and entertaining season 😁
great to see passion in football, I'm starting to like tuchel more
All the big clubs thriving and then there's united
Anthony Taylor needs the sackp
Gotta love a rivalry
The premier league is Back lol
And Tottenham fans think they're on Liverpool and man citys level. You're dreaming 😂 total rubbish.
love that fire between the two managers.
Amazing match🤯🥳✌👌
Corruption
Anthony Taylor. Spurs legend
WHAT A GAME, WHAT AN ADVERT FOR THE LEAGUE. LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
unbelievable game LETS GOOO SPURS
I know the premier league has lost its soul but it’s great to see a bit of old school agro. 🤜 🤛
Chelsea robbed by Taylor? Imagine my surprise
WOW
Jorginho needs to stop making stupid mistakes like that in the 18 yard box. Clear the damn ball!!Chelsea needs a proven striker or we are back to distant 3rd or 4th again.
So was Conte grabbing Tuchel's hand or was Tuchel grabbing Conte's hand ?   Also that ref need to give himself a red card while we're at it . Cururella's hair is getting pulled my man acts like he didn't see nothin   Then the fowl on Havertz he also apparently ain't seen nothing 😂😭.  Then again Sterling and Havertz both missed an open net soo there's that 💀
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbcccccc ccccccccccccddddddddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeffffffffffffffffggggggggggggggHhhhhhhhhhhhhhh h the best
It's so funny to see footballer's and Manager's pretend to scrap and 400 people break it up....in rugby two scrap and that's it...it's actually embarrassing to watch....what are the people going to do who are like at the back 30ft from the action.....🫣🤣
I’m looking at that tackle on Havertz before the Spurs 1st goal and I’m struggling to see the foul.
Chelsea deserved to win when romero pulled cucurellas hair its was a foul.
This fixture never disappoints
How much did Tottenham pay the ref?  Nothing but a cheating tinpot club
Chelsea v Tottenham much better than the north London derby (arsenal fan)
No red cards yet for any players yet this season meaning the first red cards to happen this year go to 2 managers🤣🤣
havertz the next timo
If Chelsea get a striker they're competing for the title
That was a foul and a red card, teh second goal should have never happened. I am so disappointed.
What a game will go down as a premier league classic
Spurs celebrating like they won Audi cup again. Embarrassing
Finally a good rivalry
Now this is your proper London derby, scenes at the end are appalling though
Battle of the bridge Mk2
Don't know why conti got red for that  chelsea manager held onto the hand of conti for the hand shack conti was provoked into that
👜
0:57 Imagine if that had hit sterling in the face.
Highlights our need to actually field a striker.. why he didnt start broja is beyond me.. the fact the hair pull was missed on the pitch is a joke and highlights why VAR is pointless.. if you cant overturn that because its not a red card offence then what's the point? Lucky Spurs again 😉
Good lord didnt know tuchel had that much strenght  in him_ pulling conte back likd that_ good game though but not impressive€ mond u its only 2 games gone thus far_ lets see wat happens in the next 5_6 games
Red cards a very stupid decision.
Can someone explain what actually happened between Conte & Tuchel? And who was in the right, if anybody was?
Hand bags and glad rags
Anthony Taylor shouldn’t be allowed within 100 yards of a Chelsea match or a primary school 🤦‍♂️
can we all just apprecitate koulibalys for one first premier league goal and home debut goal, that was an absolute peach
Anthony Taylor and mike dean need to walk pulling his hair down is assault red card for Romero and free kick the other way to Chelsea
Tuchel gets offended at conte but he runs down the line like maureen conte living rent free in both there heads lol
I wonder when chelsea will finally stop relying on their defenders to score their goals
Spurs and Chelsea is quickly becoming one of the most entertaining fixtures.
I must say it's much more enjoyable how the games have been flowing with the refs not blowing the whistle every 2 minutes because of the slightest touch. Much more of this please!
We were robbed by Antony taylor and Mike Dean again
Chelsea was by far the better team spurs got lucky.
i'm going to love watching these two sides implode this year...their managers can't stand the heat!
Thomas just got served the Black hand.
Spurs very very lucky. Chelsea dominated this game. Chelsea need a striker though that is 100 percent true. And Anthony Taylor. I am not sure how he is a premier league ref, every game with any teams involved I watch with him in charge he is woeful.
thugs
Spurs will be happy with that draw. Twas a bit of a sloppy game for them, but Chelsea look strong this season. Their defence looks great this season
Jamie Carragher doing his best Peter Andre: Whooa whooa whooooooa Mysterious Girl
I thought this was going to be a boring 0-0 but what a game! 2 defenders scoring for Chelsea - they need a number 9 for sure
Not going to lie I absolutely loved that passion and intensity from Thomas and Conte. Takes me back to the Furgison, Wenger era. Awesome match.  Good luck to Spurs and Chelsea for the rest of the season.  Much love from a Newcastle fan.  PS. Thank you for the likes guys 💪
Anthony Taylor should never be allowed to referee again
I kind of feel like Tuchel doing that silly exaggerated celebration at 2-1 was the reason Spurs got their equaliser. Karma was like, not today my friend!
Was hoping Tuchel had pulled Conte's wig off.
This was literally Battle of the Bridge 2.0
These dopes really tryna make it look like the mighty El Clasico
Most pointless things in life: Stopping the Microwave Before it Beeps. Hitting ‘Clear’ On A Calculator Over and Over Again. Referee not checking the VAR. Pushing The Walk Button A Million Times.  Fair play to both teams either way.
ref forgot his watch
Anthony's Taylor's pay from Levy be like...  stonks 📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
Apparently your allowed to pull a man down by his mullet in the box and its not a pen...
At that point they should have told Tuchel and Conte to not shake hands at the end because of the whole game they both had so much heat on each other even more than the players
you know somewhere some jammy begger has Conte and Tuchel both to be sent off on a betslip
Needs to be something done about Anthony Taylor officiating Chelsea games. It’s gone too far now. Chelsea won the game 2-0 if it wasn’t for him and Mike Dean.
COYSSSSSSSS
Anthony Taylor doing Anthony Taylor things…
Anthony Taylor had a fantastic game for Spurs
Why did Conte get a red card? He just wanted to go but Mr Burns loved him so much he just had to hold onto him!!
Anthony Taylor man of the match for 2 assists 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Klopp and Pep chooses to just admire each other. Wish they had the same fire as these two carried today.
just came here to say that sterling miss was absolutely criminal  but cant say we didnt know what we were getting into when we bought him  2 points dropped
Why everyone automatically rates Trent over Reece James I’ll never know. Ive rarely seen a chelsea game where Reece James wasn’t the best player on the pitch or playing at at least an 8/10 every week.
That first goal should haven't counted  richarlison blocked mendy
I thought conte's wig was going to fall off
A modern day classic with the early 00s feel about the game.
Anthony Taylor shouldnt referee another Chelsea game end off
Best game I’ve watched In ages and it was spurs
Anothony Taylor OUT
Tottenham going to be scary once the new players actually start games. Very dangerous team
great match great passion from both managers need more of this! not pep and klopp kissing and cuddling after an important match
This was like arsenal vs man United in 2004
What a game, I'm not even a fan of either team but that had the lot 👏
Please God a chelsea and spurs title race this season 🙏
I’m sorry but why aren’t you showing the hair pull on Cucurella. That is a straight red every day of the week or at least call it as a foul. What’s even more frustrating is VAR looking at it. Something really needs to be done about the referees and use of VAR in the Premier League
Chelsea absolutely robbed by the officials
How did the ref not call a foul for Romero on cucrella
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Not even mad that we drew. What a game this was. Tuchel and Conte carried this match.
I’m sorry but the ref was a joke
LOOOL!
robbery
Great Game, good needle, last min goal and a shocking refereeing decision, literally peak premier league lol
When will Anthony Talylor be banned from refereeing?   He has to be banned !!!  or referee in grassroots football
Kinda looked like it was Tuchel that didn't let go of the hand in the heated exchange between managers at the end?
Gosh I love the premier League
This was epic. can't wait for them to meet again
Anny darrans is happy with this one
Referee corruption at its finest
My money would be on Tuchel. Conte strikes me as the sort to hit a low blow when the refs back is turned
As a liverpool fan i wish this would happen with our club, this passion is great, but sadly all our rivals are either relegation fodder or manchester city
Insane match, poor referring cost Chelsea today. Played with some intensity from start to finish. Anthony Taylor leave please.
Come on you spurs. 2-2 as i said
Proper Derby game ref did well played most fouls on telling the players get on with it
Can’t play the video
Pure Barclays.
It was funny seeing everyone erupt in cheer at the 77 minute for 2-1 (Not like there's time for an equalizer at all lol).
Got to love it. 2 red cards for passion, get off ref.
Martin Tyler "The foul involving Havertz".  There wasn't a foul so no free kick.
All kicking off
Clearest robbery and yet that stupid bald head will continue to ref our games when it’s clear he has an agenda against Chelsea and never gives fouls or reds to our opponents, Asshole.
Video doesn’t play sky sports sort it out
tuchel a L
How Taylor or Dean can have any involvement in the premier League still is a disgrace  everytime something happens there involved one way or another
Tuchel wouldn't let go, he was the aggressor in this case.
433rd
My money is on Conte against Teuchel if the UFC can arrange it. Blink and you will miss it. Teuchel is clearly at fault for the red Conte  should appeal.
Title race is gone for us we may have to wait a very long time to see Man City drop points
Conte would eat tuchel for breakfast let's be real 🔥
The managers should be the ones telling their players to calm down.
How was that not red card romero pulls cucurella hair
Incensed as a chelsea fan, can’t believe we threw that game, twice, a disgrace! Should’ve been an easy win but no. Sure there was a foul in the build up, but why is Jorginho playing around like that in his own box? They seem to think the game is won, and we took the pressure off and got punished.  Then at the end, sure it should’ve been a red and it’s a joke that it wasn’t given as anything (how did the ref not see it?), but its done now, move on, one more set piece to defend, but instead of doing your jobs as professionals, you let them get in your heads and decide to fight with them, literally no one was trying to defend the corner. A disgrace! Tottenham deserved nothing but we threw the game through our complacency and abysmal professionalism
Spurs & Chelsea are at different points in their development. Very happy with Spurs fighting until the end for a point.
Chelsea were robbed by Anthony Taylor. Simple as that. We deserved the three points.
Tuchel is a crap leader. Throwing his hands up in the air when his player misses a chance, it transmits to the players and the fans when they see it. No need to keep hold of conte’s hand at the end and cause another scrap, petulant. These behaviours filter down
Bonkers game
Why is the video not working
That referee needs to be investigated and suspended, cause that man was not doing his job! Since when was hair pulling allowed???? This reeks of corruption!
Chelsea fans all over Twitter wishing death to Anthony Taylor because of a game 😳 It's a Chelsea thing
such a great game as a spurs fan to be honest i dont reckon the tackle on havertz was a foul he got the ball first and it wasnt reckless but i get why people complain. Also i think Romeros foul on cucurella is probably valid to be honest however im not gonna lie it was great to watch
No video!..., and it’s back!
Another year of disappointment by the referees, both on the pitch & VAR, Spurs' goal should've been brought back and only 5, 6 metres in front of the ref & linesman
Chelsea 2 - 2 Ref
Man I love Tuchel
I'll take a point away at Chelsea. not the best result but a good game even though the ref was in our favour. Tuchel is the one who started the fights on the touch line though. He overreacted hugely
tuchel not very happy because they couldnt beat the mighty spurs coys
Why watch ufc when you can watch spurs vs Chelsea
Some of the poorest reffing I’ve seen, getting a pay check from spurs.
The level of officiating in this league is disgraceful and with no accountability
Where is HEATED in the headline, 🔥💥.. I nearly didn’t watch it.
We use to see players get red cards in these games. Now both managers get them🤣🤣
Either see out the game or take your damn chances. Don’t wanna hear about refs decisions. Should’ve done better.
The ref was a joke
This was all about which manager could celebrate there goals the best... Quality viewing that.
*THE BALD REF WAS TERRIBLE*
no stream👍
Tuchel absolutely disgraceful behaviour. He knows he acted like a child..
this is football heritage
Amazing game this why everyone around the world loves the premier league.  Well done to spurs as well. They showed character you can blame on the ref as much ad you like but spurs have to play to the whistle. First half we played better than them second half they come out fighting.  Up the blues 💙💙💙💙💙
Happy with how we played in general, spurs didn't get a real chance at all
To think Man United didn't want Conte 🤦
Sad how fans rely on Managers fighting instead of the actual game being good to say whether a game was good.
Taylor is referring in the World Cup but after this performance he shouldn’t
If it was a foul on Havertz:       👇
The refereeing was disgraceful , Chelsea deserved it 100%
Chelsea 2 - 2 Anthony hotspur
Liverpool and City laughing, thinking these two teams can compete with them.
Tottenham are the most improved team in Europe
I’m a spurs fan and I was smashing the floor when that dramatic equaliser from Kane came in.
Chelsea fans now getting to witness Sterlings incredibly tame shooting in person.
Another Anthony Taylor master class, where is this VAR convos they said they were gonna release at the start of the season?
Lmao a Chelsea vs Spurs game and only the managers got sent off. The players were excellent today of both sides 😅
Why is it not starting
Why were the managers so mad at each other lol
Conte got a better grasp of Tuchel than he does of the prem
*The premier league is unmatched for sporting entertainment. All other leagues pale in comparison by every metric*
Chelsea 2-2 Anthony Taylor
How was there not a foul on cucerela
Hahaha sky sports trying not to rock the boat. Keeping all the contentious highlights out.
Conte was outclass tactically but still managed to get 2-2 I guess some managers are just luckier than others.
Chelsea absolutely got robbed today. Both goals from Spurs shouldn’t have stood, how was that not a foul on Havertz?? And since when was pulling hair allowed in football?😂 Refs have got VAR to watch it back and still couldn’t come to the right decision, crazy to me.  Well done, Anthony Taylor.👏
nothing wrong with a bit of passion
The referee was an absolute joke. Handed Tottenham two goals due to terrible refereeing.
Very brave of Tuchel to challenge the Don of the Sicilian mafia
What a match
@TUBES & ANGE GOLF LIFE - wow tuchel got sent off in this london derby game v spurs & so did current spurs boss conte
Peter couch hair pull v Jamaica when scoring was a classic
When 2 small clubs playing for small points  Big Arsenal is winning everything COYG
Meanwhile, City were watching and realising their main competition now in the premier league is their own bench-warmers from last season...
This will be remembered as a premier league classic
Spurs deserved to win it, unlucky buy the trophies 😆😆
Best league itw 🤝 worst refs itw
VAR is useless in its current state
Credit to Spurs for hanging in, but if Chelsea had someone upfront who could finish, then they win comfortably. Not sure why dragging a guy by the hair to the ground isnt a foul either.
Why's it always the refs fault when a team doesn't get the W vs Spurs. Chelsea bottled it.
Take a shot every time spurs got lucky Lineman helping them score Havertz missing a shocker Clearly a foul just before the second corner for the goal. Referee clearly being bias  Great football game but the ref and lineman needs  huge fine for being that bad
VAR refs are as useless as bike without wheels
Why was richarlison celebrating like he scored
I'm a spurs fan but let's have it right that was daylight robbery, I'll take it all day long but we're no we're near good enough
As an arsenal fan this was magical.
I bloody love tuchel
😂🤣😭 BY THE WAY LONDON IS RED
Justice for Antonio Conte
Big manager fight at the end
This was more stressing than the Liverpool game last season.
What a game of football !! Love to see passion this high in games!
What a game what's the odds 2 managers been sent of lol
Chelsea deserved that win alot
Cheats
If James had stayed on the line ball cleared also, at the final whistle when  Antonio Conte grabbed Thomas Tuchel's hand,  I thought they were going to start to jive I could hear JiveBunny in my ears
Love the 4k quality:)
Boxing fight between these managers?
Obviously they would award that second Spurs goal to Kane even though it came off James.
Conte acting the tough guy is hilarious!!!!  Sit down sweetheart 🥴🤣🤦🏼‍♂️
Typical corrupt highlights not showing why the second spurs goal should never have stood
Rocky v drago
Love a bit of passion from the managers lol
spurs cheating again shock horror celebrated that like the trophy they’ve never won 🏆🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can we all just appreciate how good that volley was for a centre half 😂
Tottenham the most hated club in London and part of the best and most entertaining rivalries in the league. Love to see it
SIMPLY ROBBED
This is what the Premier league is all about passion, fight and atmosphere
Sky sports rushing putting a heated moments vid up
Conte v Tuchel on the KSI undercard 🥊
We can all pull about a bit! 😂
Lovely game to be fair. Tottenham and Chelsea becoming one of those exciting prem games
This is a poor refereeing display the decisions today were awful
Conte the tug! The new symbol of Tottenham fc of North London!
Coys
Bro why is it in 360p😭😭😭
Conte used all of his skill points in luck and maybe a little bit of bribery he his Italian after all
Entitled fans, singing, smiling, partying have their balloons burst in the last minute. I suppose you could blame all the play acting from the Chelsea players that resulted in six minutes added on.  Karma.
Anthony Taylor sold the match today but Spurs did what they always do under Conte, stay in the football match even when the other team is completely dominating you and they picked up an underserved point
No worries Jesus is going to smash those spuds
Conte cam this week will be extra special
360p?
Klopp vs Guardiola Conte vs Touchel Lampard vs Gerard De Gea vs Maguire  Fair play this season is really heating up to be battle of the rivals.
FINALLY A MANAGER RIVALRY !!!!! LETSSSS GOOOO
A german and Italian battle it out to the very end in Lndn.
The Prem is truly one of a kind!
Spurs blatantly cheating.
The fight was the best bit of the match lmao
romero shouldve had a red, though he shouldn't have got a yellow before. extremely inconsistent, but what a match
What was that shameful  nonsense between the managers?
I’m not a Chelsea fan but how is havertz always missing these chances and not getting corned? Don’t forget he costs 80 odd million or so too
Chelsea got robbed hard
Great game but spurs won’t get top four
keep crying chelsea fans
Now that's football
A great game!!!!! I still think spurs will finish 5th this season. Chelsea were by far the better team overall and they don't even have a striker.
Chelsea vs Tottenham is bigger and better than the NLD
Spurs are the most hated club in Prem.
TUCHEL VS CONTE ON THE AJ/USYK UNDERCARD NEXT SATURDAY MAKE IT HAPPEN EDDIE HEARN
can someone explain how is that hair pulling not a red?
Chelsea robbed as per usual how's is Anthony Taylor actually legally allowed to manage football games
Why did Richarlison try claim Kanes goal and he had no parts of it. FRAUD
They had to get this one out fast
Havertz missed some biiiiig opportunities. Let off for us today but our heads never went down
How was Romero still allowed on the pitch?
I know spurs got lucky but you lot really are milking it as much as you can to make it out as if spurs aren’t good they got a bit of luck that’s football stop crying they deserve credit they’ve got a much more winning mentality now and they don’t give up and it showed today great result for them
Reece James scoring for both teams again  - the gift that keeps on giving
Not a Chelsea fan but Antony Taylor shouldn’t ref their games anymore
Handshake more firm than Man U season so far
What a game
Kai's finishing is kiling me, we desperately need a striker to actually finish the chances we create otherwise we'll continue to come up short in clearly winnable games like this
OHCOYS
Tottenham played shocking, Kane played terrible, son ghosted and got pocketed by james, they lost the ball god knows how much, and it blows my mind how a clear hair pulling isn't a sending off, VAR is honestly useless if im being honest Tottenham didn't deserve a point at all
Chelsea will not be able to compete until they sign a clinical striker  Spurs have 4 people that can play as ST kane son richarlison moura We have broja with no experience  Jorginho needs to go  Ziyech needs to play or leave  We don't need 80 million fofana
The premier league is urging all players to go bald, yes, you can be pulled down to the ground by your hair and it is not a foul
wow.... gotta feel for Chelsea fans here. this must be the biggest robbery in recent years
Lol
Love the passion from both managers there that’s what football is about
Lucky spuds i guess
Nice
Fantastic and thrilling game, as this derby should be just disappointing to drop points as Anthony Taylor and Mike Dean love screwing Chelsea, Tuchel and Conte’s fights were entertaining
Call the police!! Call the police!! Because we have just been Robbed!!
We need more passion in the prem, it’s what makes it the best league itw
What a weekend of football .   Refs need to keep this going , last year they reverted to type .
Can't belive people hear thinking this was a great game I'm a spurs fan and Chelsea battered us again
Vintage Barclays! 🔥💯
Tuchel honestly just proved why his wife left him.
As a Chelsea fan it’s a real shame that we couldn’t see it out today. On the other hand it’s great to see us dominating and our new signings getting involved! My hopes for Chelsea are much higher after this game! COYB!!!🔵🔵🔵
Most competitive and entertaining game so far this season
Spent 95 minutes wondering where Kane was. Glad he dropped by at the last minute.
it is now legal to pull your opponent's hair
Some awful refereeing, but a fun watch from a neutral standpoint haha
ofc they didn’t show ben davies fouling havertz before the 1st goal
Anthony taylor should not have a job
crazy
Scenes😍⚪️
Arsenal fan here so a draw is perfect for us BUT ROMERO DESERVED A RED TODAY. Can’t stand him, world class talks for what? He’s distinctly average, pulling cucurella’s hair too?
Cucurella will need to follow reece james and ampadu with a trim to avoid such situations
This is why we love the premier league, Drama, passion & goals it had the lot. A classic London derby.
Second goal should have never stood, How in the world is that hair pull on cucarela not a foul. Referee and VAR are a disgrace
And this is why arsenal will have a better season than spurs. They always just scrappin a draw or a win
Martin Tyler’s excitement is uncanny!
Now this is a derby I like to see. Chaos and passion
I can’t believe it
Conte what a manger completely change the game around fantastic
What a a game 4 goals, missed chances, controversial decisions and mangers fighting. Football is back
How many times Anthony  taylor must ruin games for chelsea Man it is exausting..imagine being tuchel,your team dominates the entire game only to drop points because the ref makes two mistakes on two goal..
Great game, but RIP to that clump of hair Romero pulled from Cucarella 👀🤣
i can't believe chelsea let it slide. i mean it was the battle of the bridge  part 2
We were robbed.
CHELSEA ROBBED
Thomas Twinkel Tuchel isn't very happy
So funny how rattled tuchel was
Anthony tailor needs to be sacked
This fixture never disappoints . The battle of the bridge 🔥🔥
Spurs r awful so f lucky, crap team.
We should’ve won this game 6+ minutes referee was paid
I’m not even a Chelsea fan but how was that blatant hair pull not giving a foul and a yellow card . Had VAR and the Ref done their jobs , Spurs would not have scored that equaliser
we were absolutely robbed what a disgrace
Chelsea were robbed in this game. Yes they were toothless but my goodness, ref favoured spurs today
Surely spurs 2nd goal is a own goal from James. Looked like it was going wide at least at first glance.
THIS GAME IS DRAMATIC LOVE IT LETS APPRECIATE WHAT THEY DO FOR US COME ON U SPURS MATCH OF THE DAY
Conte COME OUTSIDE YOU SHOOK YUTE SQUARING UP TO Tuchel!!!
Chelsea doing a spurs
Perfect draw for the neutrals
Honestly this was a robbery . Havertz was clearly fouled on the first goal and Romero literally pulled on cucurella’s hair . I’m not even a chelsea fan and I’m mad 😭😭😭
Chelsea letting go of Gilmour is a huge mistake
Fuming from my fpl team that wasn’t given as a Reece James own goal, surely they’ve got to have a better camera angle in the stadium
Havertz is such a dead baller
that ref really hates chelsea i swear, the amount of fouls that was suppose to be given holy
We don’t put games away like this because we aren’t clinical enough. Same story as last season
Get in kane what an equaliser yess!!!
MY TEAM TIES THE GAME 😂
Tuchel getting angry ;))
This was a real display and confirmation that Spurs are a real threat this season.
I swear there's always a match between two big six teams every weekend lol
Conte is the best manager ! What do you think? :)
As a spurs fan we did not deserve a draw or a win, but the fight we put in today definitely payed off
Sonny 🇰🇷✊😀
Ban Anthony Taylor from refereeing, Chelsea were robbed. Cucerella's hair was pulled.
WHAT A FINISH COYS
Tottenham doing more than pulling hair in the match would’ve loved conte to say something like that😂😂
ANTHONY TAYLOR NEEDS TO BE BANNED   if Your a Football fan trend to ban him
Can we have a minute of silence for all who missed this firece rivalry. 😔😔
Chelsea was robbed. Anthony Taylor is terrible and that was a red card for spurs with hair pulling.
Anythony Taylor and the officials should be wiped out and never touch a football pitch again. Actually disgraceful. Can’t even blame the players because both goals literally should have never happened if the officials made the right decision.
It’s a derby GROW UP
Spurs were underwhelming. Conte vs Tuchel wasn’t.
That was a fun game🔥🔥🔥🔥
Best game in years, the passion, the drama, the goals, the scenes. The ref was a joke however.
This result will generate momentum for Tottenham
The passion at the end is exactly why I  Love this game and why we all do Conte celebrating in Tuchel Face 😹
Liverpool are the biggest club in England 🔥🔥🔥
What an entertaining and quality game of football from Spurs!   This is why we all love the Premier League. 🔥Best league in the world for a reason! La Liga cannot compete 💯 COYS 🐔
Charity Fc, my favourite FC!
Antony Taylor is one of the most biased referees when it comes to Chelsea. Both goals from Spurs came from fouls. Crazy
This is what makes the Prem Incredible
How the hell is Romero not sent off for yanking sideshow bob’s hair?
What a game honestly, the fight between tuchel and conte just made the game even more intense 😳😳
This match had goals, touchline brawls, an injury time equaliser and red cards for both managers. Sky could have titled this battle of the bridge part 2
This is the prem. best leauge in the world.
Arsenal will destroy both chelsea and Tottenham this season
Mike dean and Anthony Taylor robbing us again
Tuchel running like he’d won it lmao
Most entertaining part of the game was Conte and Tuchel 😂
What a game this was. Pure drama and entertainment. The premier league is back!
Chelsea where the better team, Spurs only got lucky
The real highlights were on the bench with tuchel and conte
Chelsea always try to fight us.   We will always fight back.
Ref and var was terrible
The hatred between Chelsea and Tottenham is beautiful to see - this is the Premier League
Spurs won the premier league tonight by the looks and sounds of things.
Good game
Koulidaddy was class tbf
There’s no league like the premier league! ❤️
Why has Conte been sent off
the fact there were 2 red cards and none of the players got it shows how incredible this game was
Hiiiii
Did you see the end
Get in bin tuchel never mess with Italians ❤️
How wasn’t it a foul on cucerella
Chelsea so dominant all game, fairplay spurs for sticking it out though. Quality game
This game really lived up to expectations, the only prediction I’ve got right this week😂 I had a feeling this game would be high scoring and back and forth and it was exactly that 🔥
WHAT A GAME!!! 🔥

What a game of football, the reaction from the managers summarises it. Proper smash and grab
In the deep dark forest of Argentina there is an urban legend called big foot. According to theories,it only appears when Eibar and Bolivia is playing football. People from Bolivia and Eibar describes big foot as an ugly,short hairy monkey and they call it PessiBigFootPenaltyStealer. The people from Bolivia and Eibar also says that Pessi steals all the pens from their houses and all their farming tools. But  people from Bayern Munchen and Real Madrid has never seen Pesshia. In order to help the people from bolivia and Eibar i went in to the forest of Argentina to see it with my own eyes. Suddenly, my pen is missing. Then i finally saw the bigfoot and it's actually P.E.S.S.I .I called  Real Madrid and Bayern Munchen players and we captured him and from now on he will never terrorises Bolivia and Eibar again
Chelsea robbed

Romero on Cucurella??? How is that not a sending off. Yanking his hair and taking him to the ground. Setting a terrible example as players will think they can getaway with that in the future. Thought the ref had a poor game.
