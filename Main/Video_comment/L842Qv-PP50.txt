MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS GUYS!! 🤍  For sneak peeks at upcoming videos and shinies 👀- https://twitter.com/Nokimons
Yeah, sometimes I still can’t believe there’s a dung beetle Pokémon
ditto trying to look like a normal cyclizar while walking on two legs is so funny
18:47 what are those flareon doing?
10:12 dog
8:06 Two years later the same bug still there...
10:07 Shiny drowzee chilling in a bush
Yeah, I found the shiny Mastiff
Maschiff was my 2nd shiny!
That Varoom (which I also have a shiny of) reminds me of how I got my shiny Tynamo.  I had _just_ unlocked the ability to swim, so I just dove into the ocean to see what I could find and the _full odds_ shiny Tynamo just immediately swam right into me.  Another memorable shiny hunt for me was when I found not one, but _two_ shiny Charcadets at the same time, and they were literally just standing right next to each other (yes, I caught both of them).
Mashif
Mashiff
What song is this? 22:50
5:23
Mobastiff
I react faster
12:05 And that’s a shiny Magneton  Edit: Nevermind that’s his
5:59 imagine it was shiny😭
One step at a time, no matter how long it takes
10:13 The Mabostiff pre-evolution was there😂😂😂😂
Shiny foungs😅
16:59  I knew my favorite shiny was coming
24:14 you missed a shiny eiscue 😭
My very first shiny was a mankey
It was the mastiff
Any one in 2025🍰
Just auto battle all tge mimikyus
I can agree with Mimikyu being hard to find. I got faked out several times while searching for a shiny fairy type in the timeless woods from the dlc. I found one. *I love it.*
I saw the dogo
15:55 That Varoom was on a mission..
Bruh I set this vid up while I started a hunt and there was a froslass outbreak so I went there. 1 minute of knocking out mons to increase chances and BOOM she spawns. You already know I named her Noki hahaha
12:30 Halfway point
When the shiny Is hunting the humans 15:45
I managed to get a full odds, no shiny charm Mimikyu, that I'm pretty sure I just saw and was like "I think that's shiny"
8:05 also a shiny Foongus
Hey I just watched and you missed a shiny pomi when you was catching the pomi
3:52 IT ACTUALLY IS MUD 😭
its weird to come back to these videos and see people put the top bun on
Ur so lucky I only have shiny slaking
24:39 I shiny hunted Iron Valiant, tired to go no sandwich because I thought it was dumb, and while doing that, I found a random shiny Iron Treads in the cave, which, apparently Iron Valiant spawning in the caves isn’t that well known about in certain areas of the Pokémon fandom? Either way, I eventually decided sandwich-less was dumb, and got my fairy sandwich, twice, and got my Iron Valiant, who I max hyper trained after it reached level 100.
Oh lord it’s been years
THREE HOUSES MUSIC, so glad I’m here, even if it’s two years late LOL
3:51 Who rolls around it's giant ball of uhhhhh
Pre evolution of masbostif
Anyone in 2025
I've been trying to shiny hunt a few different shiny that I tried shiny hunting back in Pokémon, black or white 2 riolu still haven't gotten it.
I got my vroom the exact same way😂
10:14 SHINY maschiff in the corner
I accidentally ran into a shiny mimikyu
Mankey was my first shiny fail
11:55 he has truly become a real sv shiny hunter
12:09 for me it was SF BRIGE AKA Durlodons Evo.
17:06 YESSSS HUNTING MY FAVE LIL BABY BOYYYYYYY (when I hunted for it in the thicket I phased on an impadimp, made me so mad I traded it away and now hate it with a passion)
I found 2 shinnies in the same hour
10:11  the maschiff
Toxapex is not a good Pokémon in competitive Pokémon!!!
It took me 3 days to find a shiny ciclazard
I also saw the challenge
I just caught eight shiny Pokémon in an hour. With just the shiny charm. No sandwich. No outbreak.
Nah bro i encounterd a shiny fortress, and it goes like this,  Me: ok shiny sandwich les goo i can catch a fortress! Shiny fortress: [legit appears RIGHT after i put away the picnic] oh hi :D Me: *HOW DID YOU-*
in the corner i think i saw a a shiny maschiff or just a white pokemon
100% honesty here, I think I saw a shiny puppy there at like 10:14 or so. I hit pause to comment. I’m probably wrong. If I’m right, I would have missed that thing irl lol  Update: I was right 😂🎉
Machstiff
BROOOOO shiny mashtiff I wanted one but failed miserably
"steenee hey steenee what cha eating got anymore"
That dog is the shiny
give me ur shiny luck.
24:01 THE EXACT THING HAPPENED TO ME
March off
i kinda hoped that it would have taken you weeks on end to get them so we could get a longer video
I saw the maschiff
Hi nokimon😮
bro my first shiny ever was a  mankey but i was on someone else's account but i still need them to trade it to me
10:41 I saw it first try
It’s hard to think Noki hasn’t even made it to 500k and he’s popular but so underrated
You missed a shiny lizard
Hey guys I hatched atleast 70+ eggs over two days and didn't get atleast 1 shiny using mesuda method. Is it supposed to take this long? (btw I don't have shiny charm)
10:14  mastiff
That one dog pokemon
Shiny Maschiff at 10:12
That moment with the Varoom was the same thing that happened to me with a normal Tauros in second dlc. No shiny charm or anything, just exploring around and then charged from the side by a green bull.
When you were geting stennee i saw a shiny lechok
Wait, never mind who is it was the dogs pre-evolution
What ever the evolved form of the pink Pokémon is 10:07

Try to catch shiny iron jugilus
22:48 Dragonspine? I can recognize Genshin Impact music anywhere 😏
I have horrible luck when it comes to shiny hunting in the overworld. I have better luck hatching shinies than I do finding them. Do you have any advice? I'm currently working on getting the shiny charm in Violet, I just need a few pokemon from Scarlet to receive it.       Please help me 🙏
You forgot all the water/sea areas
0:49 Rules: no sandwich; 2:03 so after my first sandwich…
24 hours?? Nah my brain said 24 showers
That beetle with the dirt ball is actually poop its called a dug beetle
“What the ‘Hex’ am I right?”   Me: OH BROTHER THIS GUY STINKS!! 😂
Until you mentioned steenie didnt even remeber my shiny tsareena. Whos like gorgeous
Mastiff you failed a shiny mastiff 😭😭😭😭
Maschiff

ANALYSIS OF HIGH PRESSURE SITUATION: 6:08
7:20 Same what the heck ik it was on the sword and shield dlc but not in pokemon violet IN THE MAIN LAND
Ok so from 9:00 to 11:00 he missed a shiny mushroom boy see if you can find it and if you do  comment the exact second on the video that you saw it  in and if it’s correct I’ll say it it is if I don’t respond to your comment then it’s wrong good luck
I found one of these on accident lol I was trying to get greninja
Pee
I’ve caught THREE SHINY MASCHIFS I DON’T WANT TO SEE ANOTHER FOR AS LONG AS I LIVE I LOVE YOUR CHANNEL BUT THIS HAS GIVEN ME (I’m joking when I say this) PTSD
I saw the shiny in the 10 second clip, it was a grey maschiff in a pack
it pains me to see that stupid goomy THAT IS CLEARLY SHINY TWICE IN A ROW is that just edited?
When I did my ghost type sandwich for a mimikyu it didn’t give me encounter power but I still looked for it and the first one I saw was shiny lol
Omg I love Skiddo’s shiny I hunted it for days and GoGoat looks great as well
Arevins dog pre evolution
Arevins dog
I spotted the shiny maschiff
what is the intro son gcalled
“Hordes of pomni”
Varoom was shiny hunting for you noki!

6:15 “They’re… uh…. They’re flocking this way…”
Do u know what to use thenmaster ball for?’you can get the other miraidon
I knew it!!!!!!
Bro my shiny vroom just came to me too
I got a shiny machop while watching this video in the background
Lurantis is best grass type (my opinion)
Pawmi 😂😂😂
I just watched over that 10sec clip and there was a shiny drowse next to the raid den that you missed
6:19 cooking show judges be like
I’ve been shiny drive-by-ed by a tauros in the terrarium while working on the blueberry dex so seeing you get drive by-ed by a vroom just seemed funny
I wish my luck was that good with the varoom encounter i want one so bad
The way you encountered the shiny varoom is the same way i encountered my shiny paldean tauros xD
IT WAS A MASCHIF
I FOUND THE MASCHIIIIIIIIFFFFFF, BAAAABYYYYYY
I wonder if he'll do an area lock for indigo disk?🧐
10:05 ALSO A SHINY MABOSTIFF IN THE FIRST FAMILY !!!!!! Can't believe nobody saw that
You aren’t losing it. Gogoat is cool
It’s good so see another stenee  and toxipex line enjoyer
4:33  Through thick and thin  Rain or shine This Rellor would be mi- (Immediately sees the shiny Rellor)  My favorite part of this video
my question is will there be a new hunter for the indigo area lock.
10:12 Is the shiny in the group of dogs by the cliff?
Oh my goodness Noki, you NEVER hunt Cyclizar, you hatch it for this very reason lol
Shiny mabostiff at 10:05 ???
The maschiff
4:30
While you found da rellor there was a other shiny right next to you
I saw that purple pup appear
omg I actually spotted the shine Maschiff, I was sure I would miss it
I once was hunting for a shiny Larvesta in a outbreak, first sandwich and boom, shiny Rellor and Capsakid at the same time, then absolutely 0 Larvesta
i named my first ever shiny, toedscool legs. it was funni
The mabostif (dont know if i spel correct) was purple in the 10 sec clip (the first one)
As soon as i unlocked free roam in my violet game i immediately found a shiny skiddo and it was my main party member for about half the game 😂
5:19
I'm pretty sure there was a random shiny bergmite behind you😂😂
I saw the shiny maschive
i saw it
It took one look at the back to find Shiny Lurantis!!! Full odds too. Juniper is my favorite green shiny. ✨
anyone else getting really annoyed at yt for a doubble add that you can't skip for then get to watch 5 seconds of the video to get the same doubble add you can't skip. i just want to watch this video in peace.
Oh no
What are you a shiny hunting for shiny Marinee,  a shiny steenee popped up
BAYONETTA
3:07 I was in a Discord call when I found a shiny Bramblin. My literal reaction was, "Hmm.. that Bramblin lookin a little green.."  To which my friend said, "I'm sure he's fine."  Had a laugh over that.  Also I called shiny Mankey an "Angry, moldy cotton ball". Lol
Shiny Gogoat isn't just my favorite shiny, it's my favorite pokemon, period. I love their gold horns and their lil sonic shoes, 100/10 best boy
nope a shiny maschiff at 10:11
i spotted what i thought was a shiny amoongus at 10:07
shiny maschiff
23:17 fire emblem jumps are woke me up
Is that a shiny hopip on 11.12  ??!?
You missed a shiny Mabostiff 10:05
Turned on your videos for background noise while playing Violet myself Ended up turning the game off and watching because I got so into it  THIS is the Pokemon content we need more of
I loved this series and it it making me consider doing it myself
I was watching this whilst playing and found a shiny legs at the same time lol
Nice choice of music at 21:06
found it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I Think That Toedscool Was Trying To Get You To Fail The Shiny Because I Think You Were On The Side The Shiny Spawned On So If The Game Didn’t Glitch It Would Spawn On You
I actually did see the maschiff! Maybe I wouldn't have if I hadn't known there was a shiny in the clip, though.
At 14:22 I had to rewind and pause every millisecond to make sure the Nacl in the top left of the screen wasn’t shiny and I’m still unsure but I’m pretty sure it’s just the lighting
I caught the golden bug while watching this video. 😂
I saw the shiny MASCHIEF
What are your pronounces?
I am your biggest fan noki
POV: you expect this to take at least  5 episodes
My son guesses with the toedscool that you encountered the shiny before it spawned, so it couldn’t play the animation and searched for the nearest Pokémon that could play the same animation and that’s why the toedscool was right where you glitched😂
Can I have one of your shiny Pawmi ?
i did not know Framed made Gridlocked in pokemon
I saw the maschiff
My best shiny encounter was, I was sorting my PC boxes and after about 5 min in the box I closed it and standing in front of me and staring at me was a shiny axew
The good dark boy maschif
The "luck" indeed comes in bursts, although I am rather convinced it has absolutely nothing to do with luck. The game's just buggy or something. And resetting the game usually helps. Or switching the area. Bet it has something to do with memory issues or something. But yeah, sometimes it's like it's raining shinies. Then you'll find nothing for the next eternity. That ain't luck imho. That's just bad coding.
I love all your vids, you were the first poketuber i ever watched and also you were the one that got me playing scarlet, thanks for all the funny and great content  :)
Do you play osrs? This screams snowflake Ironman haha. Plus all the osrs music you use. Awesome idea bringing those video concepts to Pokémon!
I had a cyclizar do the exact same thing. Because of this video I knew it was a Ditto before encountering it.
Scarlet Violet run at locked 20fps when in docked mode. Seriously sucks, but using a 720 display may actually help.  I use homebrew ReverseNX for docked play.
10:07 there was also a shiny drowzee o_o
Your shiny hunting skills are so good that the shiny comes to you now 😂
Bruh I saw that Maschiff immediately because I hunted them for HOURS to get one.
The varoom just shooting right in front of you was absolutely hilarious, oh my god-
I thought I saw a shiny Oinkcologne at 10:06 , or what is that pink thing on the grass besides the Tera Crystal???
1011
Unless I’m going crazy, the first Mabisstiff in the clip with the shiny Maschiff is also shiny. And yes, I did notice the shiny Maschiff right away. I tend to notice odd ones out amongst clusters like that very easily.
Why can’t I be this lucky
15:56 LITERALLY THE BEST SHINY MOMENT I'VE EVER SEEN 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 AND I'VE BEEN BINGING SHINY STREAMS FOR YEARS!! The comment on top of that just makes this moment absolutely perfect and it's definitely a clip I'll rewatch a lot 😂
Pain and pawmis
6:15 I felt like I was watching a sports channel xD
At 10:07 isn´t that a shiny drowzee right next to the terra raid in the bush?
I spotit
6:59. Did your Moraidon just skurrrrrt off without you? Lmaooooo 😂.
He missed a shiny watuetl
Mobostiff
One time i was hunting for Shiny varoom and it took 4 hours and i found 6 other shinys and i was so happy and i did catch the varoom
Nokimon I have gotten myself a shiny froslass for you and named it after you
More love for shiny marinea
I've had a varoom experience in area zero I was going around area zero not to long after I finished the game and I get dive bombed by a shiny talonflame then a while after I found it had the angery mark so I named it after Roddy Piper
shiny maschief in the corner
Blvd missed a shiny pawmi at 2:18
Steenee
I somehow have about 2/3 of all shinies in the game. Yet shiny pawmi has escaped me. Every. Single. Time. I've spent 5 electric shiny boost sandwiches + about 4 hours in pawni outbreaks along with just a lot of time in the areas it spawns just running around and it just wont pop up...  Glad that you could confirm that that thing atleast exists
isn't that first mabosstiff by the tree shadow shiny he seemed kinda of blue
I never realize that in Pokémon sun and moon team rocket found a shiny Marini. I didn’t know that shiny Marini actually look like that.
Directions to by the way, the purple mushroom did you see it?
YOUVE MISSED A SHINY DROWNY
16:08 anyone know what this song is ?
1mil views for a half dozen shinys? I need to touch grass bc I have a half dozen pages of them
I just found a shiny while I was watching this
persona 5 song in a pokemon content, nice one
You missed a shiny Cyclesr
Bro that varoom was like "you don't hunt for me I hunt for you."
Let’s go I got it
I saw a shiny flareon
oh my lord i think your luck transferred to me, right after you got your shiny mareanie, i wanted to search for a shiny mareanie. I got down to the beach and the first thing i saw was a full odds shiny mareanie
Is this a YouTube video or a movie?????
You mised a shiny
I actually really like mankey's shiny.
This man is the shiny god
Gogoat looks like loki
It's called an open faced sandwich if that makes you feel any better.  I also have the worst luck, especially when it comes to Masuda method, never found a shiny that way. I just don't have the patience.
The rage I felt when the varoom popped on screen is immense. I've hunted close to 5 hours, saw one on my screen and when I went for it, one blasted in front of me and it despawned by the time I got out of the battle. I've also found a shiny Brute Bonnet and shiny Great Tusk 3 minuets of each other so.. yeah. Luck is a crazy thing lol
Bro gets a rellor 2 min into his sandwich, I spend 5 sandwiches and get a larvesta
Why didnt you catch Axew my favorite shiny is haxorous
10:08 you missed a shiny drowzee too
I remember when nokimon had 2k subs i love how far he's come 😊😊❤
shiny is one of the maschiff in the second group that popped up , right ? edit : oh i actually got it
OMG I JUST FOUND A SHINY VOLTORB WHILE WATCHING THIS VIDEO!!!!!’nnn😱😱😱😱😱
Yep I found it the shiny Pokémon
Swablu wasnt even boosted, its normal flying (it happened to me when i was hunting axew/noibat)

Masticf
U mised  a shiny Maschiff
Alright bein honest here and I saw a shiny mabistiff and maschiff ngl
Is it just me or when he caught toedschool I saw a shiny magnaton
Is there a new game and I was so upset because I went to Battle of trainer and I saw a shiny hoppip fly off screen and by the time I was able to run away from the battle and get to it it despawned it's flew in the air a green Hoppip and just left.
Mastiff
GOGOT IS VERY COOL BECAUSE I HAV IT.
I LOVE YOUR VITEOS
Can you give me a shiny whooper
Can you give me a shiny small live
Can you give me a shiny frost lass
10:12 to the left there is a shiny maschiff
Lurantis hunt sucked so bad. Found 2 forretresses and a toedscruel before I got my baby Clover the Lurantis.
I think i would have preferred it if you did the challenge on a fresh save. No herba, no outbreaks and surely no charm. See how much your luck could be tested.
18:50 SHINY???
Got shiny baton in like 20 mins with outbreak
New viewer, completely thought you sounded like bluevacktor until you mentioned them 😂
Is it a mascheaf
my friend and me wanted to trade shinies and i completed the shiny dex and this mf kept asking for wooper
Machif
tbh imma try this, since i just got the shiny charm, imma use same rules too :D
I anticipated the shiny swablu fake out from a mile
so, what about the seas?
Pawmi was one of the last full odds shiny I got while I was down in area zero
Im doing my own area lock in Scarlet  i started with a shiny Lechonk after 3 mins  im including inlet grotto and alfronada cave in which i found 2 shiny male Salandits in the same group  seriously
am i the only one who saw a shiny hoppip at 11:12
Me who has 115 hours on scarlet and no shinies
THE MOUNTAIN SHINY WAS MY 1ST I GOT IN THE GAME
10:12 shiny mastiff?
Uhhh.. hey Nokimon there was also a shiny toedscool in the Bush in area 3 😂
Crazy vid 😯😯
Maschiff found before you
i saw it lol
18:35 the most dapper shiny ever... i guess thats me
You litterly caught so many shinies in a day ( and the others ) and I still dont even know how to make a sandwhich
It took me a minute to realize there was RuneScape music in the desert. 😂
I can confidently say Noki is my absolute favorite YouTuber.
You give me shiny luck i was watching this and i found shiny marked squawkabilly
Mastiff
I FOUND AN ABRA IN HIS WAY OF DOING IT THANKS NOKIMON THANKS
Is it just me or does the last frame of the 10 sec clip of the shiny doggo contain a shiny rookidee as well?
watching this while picnic resetting for a s hiny glimmet
I like watching Noki's videos while shiny hunting, and I recently found my target of a shiny Azurill! (her name is Gii and she's so tiny ☆)
10:12 Maschiff on the left! Promise I didn't look at other comments
It was the dog in the flock
I also saw a 3rd shiny pawmi
no fucking way man, I'm nearing 400 hours and I just learned you can zoom in and out using the right analog stick
Nokimon i discovered your video a few weeks ago and now you are my new fav pokemon youtuber your videos are so hype i love the pokemon legends arceus videos
u missed shiny 10:12
bored and looking for something to shiny hunt, what should I do?

That Varoom attack reminded me of the shiny Espartha that ran up on me at light speed and demanded I catch it
Nokimon did you miss a shiny 10:22
Get shiny spirit tomb in the snow
The mushroom top was purple on my screen
There was another Shiny Pokémon in area 3 Shiny Slurpuff it’s a green boi (At least I think it is a Slurpuff)
There was actually 3 shinies in that clip! A shiny Mabostiff and Drowzee!
Shiny mabostiff at 10:05 seconds
SHINY HISUIAN SNEASLE.
The varoom thing happened to me to
Yeah I got it right it was the maschif

I found a shiny Rellor by accident when running to a raid lol I was gonna evolve it then when I saw the requirement for the evo I gave up cuz I was not walking around with a poo beetle in my party for that long
It's shiny lock in this games?
The music that you put in your videos are just ❤. Chefs kiss 🔥

Nooo you missed a shiny maschiff
10:12 is the shiny
To a lot of you who dont know this, altaria  is a dragon type- however swsblu is not. I dont know why but its not. The swablu he got was just pure luck but i guess all shinies are lmao 😆
10:16 maschiff I think or whatever the pre-evo to mabostiff is
lmao that shiny varoom XDDD that sound, "the slap", it really wanted to slap that booty of yours XDDDD
Lil doggo at the end of the clip
Is it just me, or did mareanie's shiny change? I thought the blue tentacles become purple-ish
I just got Pokémon violet I need 300 more Pokemon then I'll have my dex done then I can start shiny hunting
Ravoom: Shiny Hunted
I saw the dogging 😄

SHINY MABOSTIF PRE-EVO
You missed mabostiff
Bob the builder
Btw, you can find premier balls for sale in bulk at the auction. I've bought 50+ at least three separate times. GREAT for stocking up. (Also, you can find Apriballs which is cool 8D)
Mabostiff is the shiny
I saw it
I just felt like shiny hunting today and I got pretty lucky. Shiny Charm + encounter sandwiches only, I ended up with shiny Camerupt, Dreepy, Glimmora, Iron Moth, and Iron Thorns. Ws all around. never found that noibat tho
I'm currently shiny hunting a Mareanie outbreak on that very same beach using that very same sandwich as I watch this video lol
I sol it
This dude just appeared one day and was a god
It’s a shiny my mbossjif
LMAO when I read the part where they hunt you now
I was watching this for like the 5th time and I got my first alpha shiny and originally thought the sound was from the vid LOL-- noki's luck extended to my game LOL
It was the Maschiff, I saw it immediately 😂❤
At minute 10 and second 13 a shiny maschiff spawned and you missed it
Oh my god how the hell are you so lucky lol how powerful is the shiny amulet thing
I love how every youtuber I've watched had unanimously decided, some without any communication with each other, have dubbed Tagtree Thicket as Lagtree Thicket. It's funny to see every time
Hear me out noodles with lettus and bread might not be bad, just not in a sandwich form
I SAW THE SHINY MASCHIFF!!!!!!!!!!!!
i watched your video and thought to myself what if i was as lucky as you, 5 minutes later i made a ghost type sandwich and after 5 minutes i caught a shiny drakloac. Thank you very much for showing in this video how easy shiny hunting in this game is. ❤️
The shiny hunter gets shiny hunted oh how the turn tables  Edit: Im a massive goat/sheep pokemon enthusiast, very happy to see shiny gogoat rep <3
I hate to tell ya but I believe there is two in that clip lol the Evo at the start was also shiny
I absolutely LOVE mimikyu (:
I got shiny Mariene random before iono’s gym
The varoom didn’t have a family and heard you were hunting special shiny Pokémon so he came right over.
Bro you skipped 2 shinys a drowzee and doge
My Shiny Cyclizar CHOSE me. He just ran up to me one day while I was clearing an outbreak. He's been with me in every competitive battle since. Just like your Varoom!
AND AGAIN AGAIN, THE MUSICCCCCCCCC
I FOUND THE SHINY POKÉMON!
I saw the shiny
I have a shiny stable too
You can autobattle the mimichus they cant get killed if they shiny
shiny pawmi is the best
16:33 sir, you say that as if its a rare thing to call it "lagtree thicket"
i spent over 2 days hunting for mimikyu and those two days were pain, the trick is to look at the costume's cheeks once i found one which just approached me and just vibed with me, then while i was panicking and making sure my team was the correct team for catching pokemon another shiny mimikyu just walks on in and checks up on its shiny friend
In my playthrough I was kind of just rushing thru the storylines and wasn’t exploring any more than I needed to because I didn’t want to run into any cool mons that I wasn’t able to catch. And I wanted to hurry up and finish storylines so I could shiny hunt lol and on my super quick initial journey I came across a shiny Oinkologne right after leaving school within my first hour of the game and then a shiny swablu the first time I found Lake Casseroya.
Shiny pokemon ✨️ 😍 👌 😎 ♥️ 😄 ✨️ 😍 👌 😎 ♥️  I love is little I lost in the past
nvm masstif
dat drozy looking kinna pink in the bush
U SAID NO SANDWITCH
what was the music playing during the area 3 northern province section?

I also got a shiny rellor really quickly during my hunt for it, so this is definitely not clickbait
BRO I FOUND A SHINY FLOATZEL IN NORTH PROVINCE AREA 3 BY ACCIDENT AS WELL WHAT
maschieff on the left
He’s just salty he missed the maschiff shiny
Nokimon
This was the first of your videos I've seen, you got the Dragonspine music from Genshin followed immediately by Fire Emblem music? Instant follow.
Before telling the answer I saw a shiny mascheif in a group😭
At the end

The shiny was the dog that arven had but it first one
I am totally not rewatching totally
What Is your fav gen 9 shiny
Wenn jemand diesen Kommentar sieht der deutsch kann kommentier hier mal
My first shiny encounter was full odds, no shiny charm. A shiny moss monster, or whatever it’s called that swims in the ocean and looks like a turtle. Was tryna get the final Titan, False Dragon, I saw some random creature in a pack and was like, “Hey I think I’m gonna save incase it was shiny.” I caught it.
ugly toys
You know that your partner pokemon can thin out the numbers in the overworld and it will refuse to target shinies right?
I really wonder why so many people have such buggy games and other players have virtually none. Almost all of mine are visual. Like when I catch a pokemon sometimes the walls will vanish until the animation of the catch is finished. Then it is back.
Saw the Pokémon
Thanks for the inspiration to do my own "area lock". I followed the same rules, no shiny sandwiches and no outbreaks. But I went one step further, i locked myself in the areas where names changed. Inlet Grotto, all the different seas, etc. It was alot of fun. Think I am going to do it again. Thanks for the inspiration and a very creative idea to really explore the region.
Did the shiny come to you ?! 😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂
In the maschiff clip I swear the foongus at the start is a shiny
Nokia this is great I love you videos
For those who are wondering what the music is playing at 23:17   Fire Emblem Three Houses - Fodlan Winds
Seeing Shiny Maschiff was Easy
Once I got the shiny charm I started actually getting shinies, and I do this exact way lmao I only used shiny sandwiches twice and I have 13 shinies
I know this video is over a month old but I don't use pokeballs other than the plain pokeball even for legendaries. So if you wanted to trade you are welcome to have all my moon balls and friend balls and etc.
Im doing my own area lock and I got a shiny lechonk within the 1st 30src
I have a shiny of my least favorite and favorite gen 9 Pokémon
I Don't actually lag much but I do play in handheld mode so it might have something to do with it
If I struggle to find a shiny because of shadows I just send out my Pokémon to auto battle. If it’s shiny then it doesn’t battle them. It’s been a great time saver.
G O L D    N U G G E T    Edit: My little boy's favorite Pokemon is Steenee lol.
Funny story, I named my first toadscool 'Legs' Still got him 350 hours later, and he's still a toadscool
the fact that you turned down the opportunity to catch legs in a premier ball pains me
Wait isnt the pokemon league field its own area too????
In area three, you dont hunt shiny pokemon. Shiny pokemon hunts YOU.
i failed a shiny toxapex
i failed a shiny toxapex

Shiny mabostiff
my first mainline shiny besides legends arceus was a sneasel on the mountain in violet, which was full odds and i almost missed because i thought it was one of those pokeballs from far away but i names her trixie mattel bc of the pink body and blonde hair and i love her to death <3
Noki's copy of Violet was blessed by Arceus before being shipped out
Wugrio
The waffle house has found a new host

"A literal Scarlet and Violet shiny" it is Blue and Yellow
Hey! I got a shiny swanky in area 1 north province also! I was just trying to complete the dex and there was an outbreak for a mon I needed so I went on over. The outbreak didn’t spawn, but a shiny did.
Amazing luck but I gotta say that I loved the Three Houses music at the end
10:24 is that not a shiny oinkologne
17:20 someone else feels my pain, finally, I actually failed a shiny Mimikyu, I am yet to redeem myself with one, it was in Lagtree too lol
Maschiff
Can you do this challenge again but for each area you can only catch a certain type of shiny Pokémon like a shiny grass or shiny dark
The dog is shiny not a big one the little one
After watching all shiny locked I went out and got a shiny iron jugulis
Congats on all the shinies, got a shiny stantler when u got the mimikyu, gonna name it Noki
I saw the maschiff
Nokimon got lock on in 6:20
What about North, South, East and West Paldean sea? They have their own area title cards.
fact about sneasel: it was my first shiny in gen 9
How does one get the League Points to show up in the notifications?
I found a random shiny Donphan just by chance. One of my friends found a shiny fletchling just by chance. We’re both just casual players.
You miss a mushroom thas purple🍄💜
I am still waiting! And i am very excited for the 3rd part
i hunted for a shiny mimikyu in the same spot and god you really learn to hate the desaturation effect of shadows in this game LOL. literally had to check each one’s cheeks one by one.  i nearly gave up but found her with my first sandwich was nearly done.
So you are counting Saccorat trail as the same area as Casseroya lake?
Shiny mashchiff
oh yeah Noki, your mom and the store with a sandwich sign gives more recipes
10:16  Is it shiny Massachiff? edit: oof, i was right.
I saw the shiny :/
Can’t wait for pt3
Hahaha yoy may think two pawmi is bad but I'm pissed... I got 4 shinies in one night, two drakolok abd two glimmora
It was a shiny maschiff
hey! what was the song you use for the outro with the violins? when you were saying “episode 3” and “subscribe” it’s a really good song and i was hoping to know what it is
What happend I can’t find the new one T-T
I am quite enjoying this channel. You gained a sub a bit ago but i must say i like this!
When’s the video coming? I can’t hold my horses ok😂
You’re gonna have to run my ones if you don’t drop this last part of the video bro
Goomy was my favorite and my first shinyyyyyyyyyyt I was screaming HUNT GOOMY at the top of my lungs
Okay great vid but the music omg holy Christ the music at the start is a bop 🤣
I want part three NOW
how long does it take for u to get one shiny
i also have a shiny gogoat
Hey Nokimom, if you were to guess what two shinies I have, what would you guess with?
I saw a foongus
10:05  I did as well and I was confused if that was a shiny
While watching this episode I found shiny mudbray and shiny gogoat literally next to each other.
You missed a shiny rookidee in the 10 second video it is behind the treee
In Soviet Paldea shines hunt you
My first 2 shiny pokemon in pokemon scarlet were sneasle and I love them and named my first shiny sneasle Nokimon because I know you like sneasle and weavile but not sneasler btw great video
I love nokimon uploads
Bro I started the paradox pokemon shiny hunt liturally 11 days after this upload and found all of them a few days ago
i still cringe everytime you call a pink shiny 'red' TTwTT
I got that just randomly 3:58 in shiny form
if there's one thing that legends arceus definitely did better, its the shiny noise and sparkles.
I’ve caught 2 shiny mareeps on my 1st day of playing
I just walked out the ghost gym town and shiny sneasel was just.. chillin. Like “hey, took you long enough.”
17:10 the ghost sandwich is so awful it turns you into a ghost
10:07 Hey umm... looks like there are actually 2 shinies in this clip. There is a shiny drowzee in the bush next the tera raid den
@Nokimon I challenge you to add shiny pokemon that can only be found just outside every city but I'd rather you have shiny power sandwiches to speed it up cus how limited your area is
can someone tell me where to get sandwich recepies?  can i buy them or do i have to make the sandwich to get the recipe?
Tbh I don't really care for watching shiny hunts in this gen, but, your videos are so entertaining that I can't just not watch yours specifically.
Noki tbh ur just bad at hunting cyclizar no offence lol 😂
Why is a minor version of jingle bells so cool
Did nobody else realize the shiny mastibiff in the same clip as the shiny maschiff
Luck is a skill
INSANE
Why not go into someone else scarlet and shiny hunt in area zero to get the past shiny forms
As the number one tsareena enjoyer i'm SO happy to finally see my girl being recognized and put on a competitive team like in S/M 🥺
Paradox vidoe when
8:04  You missed a shiny Amoongus
The shiny pokemon was a mabosstif I think
The grey dog pokemon or something i havent watched the end yet
I spoted a lil shiny dog
Marenie was my first gen 9 shiny so its awesome that you pit it in the video!
How did bro not see the maschiff.
You said your game seems to be getting buggier, I was watching a thing recently that said the longer you have the game open, the more issues it will have. I forget the reasons why, but essentially just close the game and reopen it and it should help a lot.
Noki please upload your new video final part of this I love this series so please
Blue fungus before dog
I caught the same shiny in the 10 second clip today
Amoongus
10:12 it’s a shiny mashstiff (I think that’s how you spell it)
Nokimon i got a video idea make a video where you find a shiny of every alphabet with no sandwiches just outbreaks and shiny charm
My 3rd shiny was a rellor😁✨
Hi noki p.s I got a shiny velza 😅
I decided to hunt for my own shiny Mimikyu not that long ago because the grayscale felt really cute and unique. I remembered you had a bit of trouble with yours, but I didn't have any fool me because I would just check each one to see if its cheeks were red which was fairly obvious in the shade.
I can't wait for the finally
Amazing presentation keep it up
Shiny hinting has come sooo far. Imagine telling a shiny hunter 10 years ago you're longest shiny hunt was 3 hours long.  They'd implode
I caught a shiny Corviknight and shiny Dreepy within a single hour in area Zero.
Is it just me but you kinda sound like ian boggs.
Nice edits man!!
Bro hurry up IM STARVING
Does the starter pokemon always have a mark? Haven't been able to find anything on if it's a small chance or if it just always does.
Yes, let's go!!! Saw that shiny maschiff. (If I spelled that wrong. Sorry, but stuff be happening)
congrats to that varoom on it's successful shiny human hunt!
I loved watching this because i know i can’t do this at all but i started for a shiny roller since the gold ball was awesome when i saw you catch it but keep up the amazing content man
That swobble was in a group tho I thought that’s against the rules ;-;
I was shiny hunting hoppip because I like him, he's just cute, and I was getting ready to make a grass boost sandwich,  and there was just one sitting there, and he just walked up to me, it was a good day.
I was just searching for a salazzle, and then i saw a blue snowrun and was like uh? It was my first shiny just like that
Such a cool idea for a video, inspired me to go out shiny hunting now. Anyone else?
As Maschiff was my first shiny, I know how easy this one is to miss. Not as easy as Paldean Tauros, but my Maschiff was hiding on the side of a cliff!
As soon as i opened this video, i got a shiny bisharp on my pokemon scarlet! Edit: it's also marked!!!
one of the gen nine puppies lol
I saw it
0:28 bayonetta music?😧
You know what's sad ....... I'm not eating ....
Are you going to do the paldean seas
Lol, I found mimikyu accidentally while hunting Impidimp
こう言うスポーツ系も好きです！最近ブルーロックにハマってるから個人的にこう言う動画は嬉しい
16:29 for some reason it doesn't lag for me in there and I'm on switch lite 19:46 ughhh what Pokémon game is this from I can't remember where it's from, Edit for 19:46: nevermind I found it, it's Anistar City from X and y
Not hard to do ngl
He even missed a shiny mabosstiff at 10:05
13:46 I actually have toxapexs shiny in Pokémon sword but not in violet
Love your Videos Noki! I have a really cool idea for a shiny hunting marathon with your idea. Great video as always! Keep it up.
Was that the dragonspine theme on the mountain lol
Bro u ok. Your eyes ok? Do u need help?
The baby dogo
10:12 was it the dog?
My first violet shiny was steenee so glad to see you got it Also I got it in a flying only hardcore nuzlocke so it’s gone.
You know the place you got run over with the vromm well there was another shiny in the background sorry
Bonus challenge: try finding a shiny Pokémon in the cave of poco path Where you first found miraidon.
You miss shinny at 4:30 please check the video again and give me reply if I was right
manchstiff
I watched this video earlier today and just now I got sniped by a shiny Bombirdier exactly how that Varoom hunted you. I only started shiny hunting a few days ago but apparently I'm already on your level
Noki this is a joke I will give you my shiny larantis in Pokemon sword for sinistea authentic
bro i looked at my profile in violet and it said i battled 4 shiny pokemon WHEN I ONLY HATCHED A SHINY IMPIDIMP FROM AN EGG. (i named him Minion)
He saw the maschiff       ...I saw the oinklougne
When he got a shiny go goat I realized that’s the same place I got my shiny gogoat
Can I pls have 2 shiny iron valiant for my sis I'm ur biggest fan
I was fighting Ortega while watching this video and she pulled out a shiny dachbund
Man I'm so sad I missed out on the Charizard raid!! Only have had the game for a week. I'm the only one I know that likes pokemon.. ugh any one have a trade? Please let me know
I love ur videos noki
That opening earned you a sub
That Varoom really wanted to be with you
I watched you when you only had 3k subs or so, and I wish I had subbed before since you are an amazing, Youtuber I finally saw you in my recommended, and I remembered and subbed
I was in a raid and lost to a shiny Armaroude it was very emotional :( I did catch a shiny Scovillain (the evolution before it) like five mins before though so didn't feel as bad lol
Dude your videos are crazy enjoyable and entertaining. Keep up the great content!
Maschief
I kinda found a shiny when I first started this game but when I tried catching it used whirlwind :(((
l find it
Your response to cyclizar reminds me to my response to both of my (full odds) shinies on my violet save.  I was going about my business outside the fighting squad base, i saw a tm and went to grab it. a pack of Growlithe and an Arcanine spawn in before me. yellow. i mash the dash button as fast as I could. direct hit, quick ball. his name is cheese.  The other one was while i was grinding tera raids. I was in the southern province, not sure the exact area. I miss my target a bit, and turn around to correct. at the edge of my screen, pink. my response? "hi hoppip :]". i begin to glide away. in a quarter of a second, i play that back. that pink was too light. i flick the right stick a full 180. target spotted. the hoppip was in fact sus. sus as in, the scientific name for a pig. I land on the lechonk. maybe a second has passed since i hit the air. her name is starburst. the tera den was 3 star.
No videos since last year smh
How the hell is your game lagging this hard o.O I never had (and still haven't) any issues with lag in my game  whatsoever.
If you see this how do you evolve snowrunt to frostlass
I got cyclizar as soon as I entered the area it took me like 6seconds to realise
like a few minutes before he found the shiny gogoat i found a shiny skiddo
This game is sooooo bad i hate it
Could you not see the maschiff because it was night?
Nvn it was red/white dawg
It was the ulgly shiny pug
1st foongus that was alone
Vroom vroom
I just got my first shiny today (a shinx), and not even 2 hours later I got a shiny cetoddle and it was AMAZING
I found it
Actually i can fully relate to 14:00, i got 4 shiny iron jugulis in 10min, last 10min of my sandwich.  Today i shiny hunted a gyrados outbreak, even with a sparkling power sandwich and >60 kills, i literally resetet 15 gyradoses the whole 30min, and got one single 10 min AFTER the sandwich. rng is rng guys
was it shiny amoonguss?
I caught a shiny heracross (male) in arceus🥰
i have been playing Pokemon games for over 12 years now since i was a kid, just played though Violet, and i have never in my entire life seen a single shiny in any game outside of Pokemon GO. i have never hunted for them either and never played much in the lategame, but i mean cmon after catching like thousands of Pokemon in all the games and still 0 shinys.
10:13 😮
Me and blue have something In common I spotted two of the hardest shinies to spot iron treads and and pakdean Tauros in an instant
THE LEAN TRIO
MY FIRST SHINY IN POKEMON VIOLET IS THE BIG DOG BRONZONG
How dare u 19:25
dont think i didnt hear the dragonspine theme at 22:55
Is that FE3H music in the background
the shiny sneasel part contained genshin music?
I SAW IT IT WAS THAT SHINY DOG OR WHATEVER THE NEW DARK TYPE!
Me after watching this: time to shiny hunt for gingar
It’s next to the raid den
Does anyone know the song at the end of the video when he finds the shiny floatzel? I’ve tried everything to find it :(
So I’m assuming they appear shiny before you attack?
10:12               theres a purple maschiff there...
There was a shiny Maschiff. 10:15
I think the foongus is shiny dude 10:20
Be glad you're playing Violet. It took me more time to find a shiny Roaring Moon in Scarlet than it took to find every shiny paradox pokemon combined in Violet.
oh dude you know blue vaktor that’s so dope i grew up watching red so it’s cool yk blue
I think the shiny in the clip was a mastchiff but idk ill find out | edit: I  KNEW IT
The dog
I still need to complete the pokedex man
I got a shiny roaring moon 15 minutes into my first sandwich no shiny charm
I havent seen the answer on your shiny lock but the answer is mashieff at 10:12 and when that shiny varoom ran over you that reminded me of when they same thing happened to me but with a rufflet
MASCHIF ME BOI
Thanks to Blue I was able to find my own Shiny Maschiff! If i didn’t watch your video I would’ve ignored the shiny Maschiff in one of the Tera Raid.
shiny maschiff
THERE WAS A SHINY MABOSSTIFF IN THAT 10 SECOND CLIP LOOK AT THE BEGINING OF THE CLIP TO THE RIGHT
The shiny was the doggo in the group of doggos :)
Noki, I think you forgot Dalizzapa Passage…
Bruh the shinys hunt for him now
O MY GOD HE  has't Uploadted in 7 days wow much shines are there in area ZERO and how much time is he going to spend on one video 🧐
A bit salty how lucky you get at full odds I must admit but that’s cool 👍
Can we just respect that he got 25:00 min exactly
I've started my first shiny hunt of Violet because of this video. I'm gonna get a shiny mimikyu no matter what!
Most ppl most have a bad batch of Switchs. The game runs perfectly fine on my system. No lag, bugs, anything.
10:12 maschiff
My first two shiny Pokemon were both mareanies in that beach. And I found them right next to eachother in a mass outbreak. Almost skipped over it cause I thought they were just a female version of mareanie cause they were right next to eachothef
it's getting so annoying the way you complain about lag in each vid its not as bad as everyone seem to think it is
You call him legs I call him Squidward 😂
10:07 also looks like a shiny drowzee
I thought it was a shiny Mabosstiff on the right.  I didn't even see the one on the left.
There was a shiny foongus
bro the shiny mimikue that you found looked too bright to be a normal mimikue
Manky is mint choc chip ice cream
I saw it
I went afk in legends arceus once after a battle with a sudowoodo and when I came back the sudowoodo that had respawned in its place was shiny and had been sitting in front of me smack dab in the middle of my screen for 30 minutes
bro eastern province area  two is where I lost a shiny wiglet in a losing battle am still mad since it was a child with a U-TURN team and I was under leveled i only got one hit off on the bird. ONE
12:24 Bro I'm shiny hunting with no sandwich for a shiny finizen and oh boy, that freaking shelder looks just it. I would like to know WHO in Game Freak thought making finizen spawn allways next to shelder, who has a colour just like shiny finizen. I hate shelder for that reason.
I actually got a random shiny Cyclizar during my playthrough. I was trying to find a aqua breed Tauros and then I thought I saw a Cyclizar that looked a little different I encountered and yep it was a shiny and was able to catch it in a quick ball. Also I caught a shiny Donphan not long before
that awful joke was literally me
murshroom!
while watching this video i found a shiny rookidee
Wait why i am i watching this at the last few minutes till its 2023💀
Don't let this awesome video distract you from the fact that Nokimon ignored the North, South, East, and West Paldean Seas. We are owed 4 more shinies
I WAS WATING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG
Why does the thumbnail say “SHINY LOCKED.”?
Yo Noki! Hi discovered (probably not I think someone already found out) that if you save before the end of and outbreak or just let a day pass you can softreset the outbreaks to have the outbreak you want to spawn. All you need is pathience
The maschiff on the left was shiny
0:23 is sort of... reich-ey.
Noki It's been longer than 24 hours Are u OK?
I SAW IT
Shiny maschief on the left (while I’m commenting this after the reveal, I still spotted it beforehand and I don’t blame you for missing it, it looks exactly like a rock lol) (edit: didn’t know he mentioned the rock thing until right after posting this)
as soon as i started watching this vid i accidentally got a shiny tatsugiri 😭🤍
Hi Nokimon! This was one of the best videos I could ask for on Christmas! A true Christmas 🎅🏻 blessing!😊
the Noki’s Version hahaha youre a fan of taylor swift i see xD
The first wild Wugtrio that I saw in game was shiny, I was only even a little bit sure that it wasn't the normal color at first
I saw it instandly, I love mabostiff
Thank u your luck spread to me and I got shiny roaring moon while watching
one time when i was shiny hunting whopper i used a poison sandwich, turned to the right literal seconds after i made the sandwich, “Hey is that croagunk green?” and then i was like, “is that another shiny one taking a nap?” no wooper, just fwog
Nokimon
You know that his not sleeping for days when he starts to be gone for weeks.
I found a cyclizar outbreak put on a dragon encounter 2 sandwich and found a shiny cyclizar in 10 minutes
Episode 3 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
they love you even tho that you are kidnaping the shinys and they are hunting for you now
20:39 This was my first shiny in Pokemon Violet
the dog
How were u able to stream on discord while playing on the switch?
You make awesome videos Noki
Man I found a shiny Mimikyu in Lagtree Thicket on my first playthrough. Mimikyu is my favourite Pokemon so I went to catch the first one I saw not realising it was a shiny because of the tree shadows lmao.
The shiny in the clip was a maschiff at 10:13 minutes of video
mabastif prerevolution
Did you get inlet grotto
you forgot all of the sea areas (east paldean sea, etc.)
Great as always, also the varoom gave me memories of the time a shiny sneasler ran into me while I was finding for roaring moon XD     Also I loved this video, keep up the great work! :D ♥❤️👍🏻👍🏻🌸🌸
I love ur vids keep up the good work
Bayonetta music is 💋🤩
I hated hunting for my mimikyu but it happened after about an hour. Glad to know other people had a hard time on it and it wasn’t just me.
i saw the Maschiff as soon as it spawned in lol, betting only bc i was told to expect a shiny
At 10:20 there is a shiny foongus so you missed a foongus and mashchiff
my first shiny in  scarlect and violet was mareanie, and i almost did a picnic  and lose it.
what song is that at 22:50 it’s so beautiful but I don’t remember 🥺 is it from sword and shield?
nokimon big idea make a fourth one were u catch the scarlet paradox Pokemon
I think I just found the mysterious ways 😂
I was doing a noibat out break witch was next to the steel Tera wild dragonite and that was the shiny I found that day
I want to have kids with you  And yeah, great content! Here since almost nothing 😄
I had the shiny maschiff until I evolved it into shiny mastbotiff
When you got a shiny gogoat I thought it looked like Loki 😂
shiny maschiff
I got a shiny cyclazar when i was running to a new area the lake and it ran into me.
10:30 thats a skill issue over there,i did too
7:07  The forest isnt a separate area. Its got its own name, sacarot trail, therefore its a unique area
Guys ummm I don’t know why I just get to glaesado mountain and find a shiny snorunt🫤
my first ever shiny was a male Snorunt that I randomly bumped into in Violet while in a cave, my camera angle wasn't even on the pokemon and when i turned the camera i was like NO WAY! I had never shiny hunted before but have caught  6 so far this game!
Omg I thought u used Nintendo controllers lol😅
I’ve been waiting for this yaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy
At 10:07 is that a shiny hypno?
Masstiff was shiny in the cluster at 10:12
A shiny floatzel was my first gen nine shiny actually
i found a shiny toedscule but didnt realise till i looked back on the vid
Dude came outta nowhere and got so many subs
The transitions though
I also saw the maschiff
Also in sword, I was running around the wild area, and randomly stumbled upon a much more green karablast. And that started my journey of losing my mental sanity by looking for creatures of odd colors
Lol  MY shiny Bagon took me 4 sandwiches. That stinker.
The Machiff it was grey
Was it a shiny maschiff?
YOU MISSED A SHINY SLOWPOKE PAUSE AT 7:10 exactly u can see it’s nose is more yellow and it’s body is a bit darker
You Just Spoilerd that your gonna Catch all paradox Mons from area 0
What does shiny goldengoh
I saw a maschif that looked odd
How do you find more shinny's than me and I had a shiny charm, sandwich, and outbreak. I looked for 4 hours to find a shiny fortress and still did not get it.
Did I just heard dragonspine's bgm at 22:50? Anyways good video to watch while I was doing masuda on my Quaxly for 2 days (I'm dead inside).
Currently hunting for a shiny dialga in brilliant diamond wish me luck
This is the most UNDERRATED poketuber ever I swear to god
Shiny swablu holds nice memories for me since during a nuzzlock of Alpha Sapphire I found one as my first encounter for an area and named him Trophy.
#50 on trending!Good stuff man
I cant be the only who saw that little shiny among us mushroom right
lol i love it i got shiny bounsweet in day 1 not even 2 hours in i was like what i had her on my team the entire story XD
digging the amount of RS music you are rocking. Truly the best RNG hunting music
What if mankey was a Ditto
🌠🌊🌟🌈🤍
go goat kinda look like Loki
Morytania locked
I got a shiny mimiku while looking for impadimp
I love this series but as someone that would never buy the game, I don't understand how Nintendo keeps releasing games that look worse than GBC games, and also have vast open spaces with nothing in them.
Found the shiny, it was mastiff
im being honest i did find the maschiff before you told us
I saw the shiny maschiff too
This is probably one of his best shiny hunts that's not   the masterball series
my Favorite shiny is shiny klawf.🦀
my mans lagging like hell over here, and my like 5 year old switch running pokemon scarlet like nothing
It was a maschiff 😭
The selection of Runescape Music is 5 stars. You got yourself a new subscriber!
Mimikyu is my favourite pokemon, and seeing you capture one is incredible. Suscribed to see the Area Zero video : )
I found a shiny spider immediately the first day I started playing and I’m like OH
You and Blue Vactor are my favorite YouTubers , your content is hilarious and very entertaining when I am shiny hunting
Nice Runescape music in the background. Always enjoy a nice hidden gem RS soundtrack played in the background.
wise mystical herbs
Me who has only found one shiny out of all of my Pokémon games. Even worse is that I wasn’t even looking for it.  Also dragonspine is has an amazing sound track if not the best in genshin impact (you added fragile fantasy in you video)
10:05 there is a shiny Mabostiff. If I'm right
I remember when you had 50k I love the vids Noki!
Noki, if you auto battle a shiny pokemon the pokemon will refuse to attack it. I also hunted for shiny mimikyu and battling every one with the lets go feature really narrowed down which was shiny and made it a whole lot quicker. Love ur vids.
17:51 I’m so jealous he got Mimikyu befor me and also congrats on it my fav Pokémon
I got 2 shiny Mareanies :>
Ok honestly. I was hoping youd hunt shiny wormy boi (orthworm) but as soon as i saw the shiny varoom attack you i laughed
“Rellors shiny form is one of the most unique shinys in the entire game” Magikarp: am I a joke to you
Bro missed a shiny
15:35 omg... yeasterday i spend 3 hours looking for this pokemon and i didn't found it
hey noki i have a pokemon you dont have shiny, shiny dialga
Weaviles Golden Crown is just the best
Actually, you can use Let's Go Mode to check either the pokemon is shiny or not. Because your pokemon will reject to battle shiny pokemon.  Also, you forget areas of West, North, East, and South Paldean Sea.
I wish Shiny Pokemon were still rare or hard to obtain.
I love your content and  this series and everything in general keep it up man ❤
your going to make me start shiny hunting this way this is a really awesome series
As a man who has been here since 60k I can confirm this man is physical and mentally unstable  Which is why I watch this
Not the random gogoat iv'e been hunting for like 2 weeks
That magneton is his shiny magneton
Nokimon read the dek entrance of frostslash you may take back you’re word
In mother Russia, you dont hunt the shinies, THE SHINIES HUNT FOR YOU
Why is it that everyone’s scarlet and violet games are super laggy and buggy……. Like mine has had zero problems I’ve played through the game 2 times now and no lag or glitches
Instantly seen the shiny
Wigtrio is my favourite Pokémon. I am pleased you got one🙂🙂🙂😉
NOKI! NOKI! YOUR VIDEO AT THE TIME OF TYPING THIS IS #31 IN TRENDING
I've been a huge fan of Pokémon ever since the original release. However a motor on a Pokémon, wheels, and one that looks like a cart with rocks in it.. TF? This isn't Digimon. They're ruining the franchise with this lets be real.
Don't the various oceans in this game also count as their own separate areas? They have text boxes pop up when entering them so
Cool
I randomly got a shiny rellor doing a gym test
The OSRS music gets me every time lmao
24:00 The Floatzel is SO unlucky😢
In Glaseado Mountain you should have gone for the cutest Pokémon ever: Cettodle!
Answer to Gogoat: YOU ARE LOSING IT!!!!!
And? This isnt impressive, shinies are useless.
Am I the only one to see the evolved form of the shiny dog in the clip? Like right at the beginning there was a shiny evolved form.
Lets go I was waiting for this chapter. I hear the notification and I click on it
Let me guess find all ten of the paradox shinys.
i found a shiny gogoat completely full odds in that EXACT same place you found yours! i named my gogurt <3
Lmao I did the same thing for mimikyu and it was awful
Ooooo can’t wait
tip: pokemon with dual types only have one sandwich that works . scovillain's first type is grass so that would spawn more scovillains. just a lil tip i thought would help on you  area locked journey.
Scovillin What is the first shiny I ever got
I would’ve said Tagtree thicket would’ve been east providence. But to each their own
anyone know the music playing at 24:00?? its so good i neeed to know
is that a shiny drowzee in the bush at the start of that 10 second clip?
The dog 😔
I think it was a Hypno: nope it was a mascheif
What is the music at the end in the background
*All the areas before area zero*  Me: Points to the Seas which are technically considered their own areas
I’ll just play Yo-kai Watch thank you very much
10:23 Isn't there also a shiny drowzee in the bush he goes by?
Apparently you are wrong, shiny Gogoat is AWESOME!!!
What about the great crater (seperate from area zero)
Purple dogg
12:06 Iono pov
About two minutes after you catch your shiny monkey I catch one too
I noticed the shiny Maschiff since I was lucky enough to find one myself that spawned almost in front of me
I was playing Pokémon scarlet and after 2-3 hours the game crashed, I realized quickly that my game didn't save, and I reloaded. All my progress was gone but 10 minutes later I found a shiny male sneazel so I guess it was a good trade off? (Just found out it was marked) Btw u make really good content keep it up!
The shiny varoom made me laugh out loud 🤣
It was Mashife. Or the smol red doggo boi.
I had the same thing happen to me with the shiny varoom, I didn’t know what it looked like and it was driving around my screen and it randomly ran into me, which then let me see that it was a shiny. Also my first shiny in this game
spotted that maschiff instantly, it's quite different from it's original coloring,
you cant tell me that’s not a shiny drowzee behind the terra crystal you missed.. 10:23
10:07 I can’t tell what that Pokémon is next to the Tera raid, the one in the bush, I might just have a messed up head but it kinda looks like a shiny oinklogne or how ever you spell the evo of lechonk
Im so hyped for area zero
it was a maschiff i think edit: so turns out im not blind luckily
I love a anhilape’s shiny 🥺 he’s dead so he’s blue 😭 we named Bluebury
i honestly dont know how you didnt immediately notice the maschief, its bright purple lol
Hey, i know you probably won't see this but i really like your videos, and i wish i could be like you someday, you inspire me a lot, but im kinda scared to post anything serious, but thank you noki! Keep up the great content
Sandyghast shiny better than toxipex
Got my second shiny today after 1hour hunting after a shiny gyrados I got a shiny floatzel  not complaining tho
I personally don't get the huge slowdowns others do, is it because I play in handheld?
who played iliO on google play?
Or as I call it: Tagthree lickit.
I found it
i got it
What's in the bush by the crystal at 10:23? It looks like a shiny Oinkologne
Bro mymikyu is my favorite pokemon
Nice Video Noki I just got full odds Goomy 😀
Don't forget the 4 ocean areas
Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays Nokimon! Fantastic work and excited to see the finale to this phenomenal series! 👏👏👏
10:11 shiny maschiff in that pack there on the left
Noki and Blue have been my favorite shiny hunters since arceus came out!!! Im so thrilled they are friends and hunt together 👌
Can’t wait for part 3 because it’s what I do in my free time
sliding into legs' DMs like 😘😘😘😘
I spotted the shiny Maschiff! That was actually my 6th shiny in Scarlet (also full odds).
13:45 well… about that…
Dark pupper go brrrrr Lol I noticed it the second you started passing it
He’s gonna get a friend and get all the past form shinies too from area zero
I'm a pokey nerd 2
MASCHIFF! Although not on the screen for long...
You are insane
18 mins and 50 seconds you missed shiny indeenee
I’ve never seen one of your videos until this one and… just… take my sub. Looking forward to the area zero hunt
I love your videos Noki! Also love the cool camera shots and effort you put in! Hope your channel keeps growing :]
Congrats on 200k!!!
I’ve beat the game and I still haven’t found a shiny.
Loved the vid plus the music in the northern province during the sneasel encounters.
Is it weird that part 1 made me go shiny hunt a pokemon and get lucky with it
Do you still play Runescape?
Nvm lighting
Does anyone know what fire emblem song he used at the end because I'm not going through the fire emblem sound track
The hunt I can enjoy, Shiny Mimikyu. Color blind friendly!
during my first playthrough of pokemon sword i randomly came across a shiny toxapex which i still have
Okay but that Mabosstiff at the beginning of the clip was looking pretty shiny as well. It may have just been the shading, but he was looking pretty blue.
In that 10 second clip, there was also a shiny Greedent in a bush you passed by.
bro congrats on #1 trending thats insane!!! 😁
Every Nokimon video is like a cinematic experience
You know tbh honest 5:46 it just looks like you ran into it instead of it running into you
I saw the masterball and thought area zeros hunt would be miraidon
the mabostif
11 in trending
Mabosiff
Man i remember when subbing when u sub 100k man u grew fast and im happy for u, u derserve it! Merry Christmas
Scovillain got dem apple bottom jeans
If you try to find a shiny and you don’t know if it’s a shiny auto attack it because it won’t auto attack shines
I can’t believe after all this time that you didn’t know how to zoom out of camera I’ve learned it on day one of how to zoom out the camera
Took me 5 minutes to find shiny iron valiant.  Took me 2 hours to find shiny toedscool.   WHY?
That’s exactly how I got my shiny varoom. I drove past an outbreak and he crashed right into me.
Man,I wasn’t expecting you to catch a shiny version of my favorite Pokémon Sneasel.
i definitely agree with the gogoat. Reminds me of some norse mythological creature
completely honest in the 10 second clip i thought it was the second foongus
Named my Froslass Noki :3
so noki uhm if you look at the bush at 10:23  i think you missed shiny oinkolonge
It was a shiny maschiff!!!
I saw the shiny dog  But at first I thought you meant the shiny Toedscruel in the bush at 10:07  Edit: I'm not sure... 1. Can Toedscruel even spawn in this area 2. Are there any other Pokemon in this area that look like they have pink tentacles?
Man i love you vids so much. And the Fire Emblem Music in the background, ahhhh uncompetable 🎉
Trying to get shiny venomoth in tagtree thicket at night is pain. They all look like the shiny and you're just sitting there trying to sift through all of them.  I had to give up on that outbreak it was too much and I needed to sleep lol
After the first video came out I got Pokemon violet and tried to go somewhere I shouldn't have been and the game rewarded me with a shiny hopip
Dalizapa Passage?
Why did the pokemon in front of the ters raid also look like a shiny drowzee?
Maschiff shiny in the 10 second clips lets see if i got it.
Decided to do this challenge as well. I was in East province area 2, deciding to hunt for sandygast or mareanie switching between poison and ghost encounter 2 power. I found a shiny magikarp instead, after catching that I walk down the beach just a little to find another golden Karp. Not sure to be happy or mad
Here's to hoping that I managed to *_finally_* complete my shiny hunt for my first (now intended) Shiny Pokémon so I can carry on with the game and finally finish the story, so that Area Zero Content won't be spoilers for meー (٥↼∀↼)
@10:13 Idk what it's called in English, but (although you probably can't tell if I'm cheating or not), I'm 99% sure I saw a Shiny Grondogue thereー  I make a career out of staring at colours, so I tend to notice inconsistencies in familiar spaces relatively easily. ( ´◡‿◡`)✧
I always thought shiny mankey looked like mint chocolate chip ice cream. :>
Put your mind at ease @ 3:52, the Pokédex _very clearly_ states it is indeed mud despite it clearly being based on a Dung Beetle. ┐(‘～`;)┌
Bro I thought you would do one area but you did three.Amazing
It was maschiff
Meanwhile it took me 3 weeks of hunting shiny varoom. During mass outbreaks Without sandwichs and only had shiny charm for a couple days when i got it.
By far the best quote ever from Nokimon 😂
I saw the maschiff in the ten second clip
16:30 nice stolen joke from mandjtv
damn you went looking for all three of my shiny pokemon, gogoat, wugtrio and sneasle
auto subs
👇Before 50K gang
10:12 Found IT!
I killed a shiny deerling
Man I hate your luck. Me using a friggin shiny sandwich isn't as lucky as you.
His shiny reflexes on getting cyclizer: unparalleled His shiny reflexes on seeing shiny masheif:  💩
Watching shiny hunts is not the same after watching that crazy dude catch a whole Pokedex worth xD. Albeit it took him a year and a half. But yeah. This series is still as entertaining since i get to see more shinies
That was a shiny mabostiff at 10:00
I  saw  it
*Noki uploads:* yooooo yess a new video! *hears bayonetta*: LESSS GOOOOOOO
can we all appreciate that slow and dramatic sandwich making montage
I JUST KNOW HE WILL GET ALL PARADOX POKEMON IN AREA ZERO I KNOW IT
What are the odds of that varrom doing what it did
Bruh your shiny luck is god tier, I get like one shiny a week tops and you're out here catching like 3 back to back
Right before the shiny maschiff in the shade, near the small ruin there was a shiny mabosschiff, and I saw it when you told me to look for the shiny. So tthat clip 100% contained TWO shiny pokemon.
Bro I got shiny Sneasel today too that's cool except mine was a girl
You’re not far off in having done a female locked 🔒 shiny area lock challenge. 😂
15:41 that happened to me as well... but with a dugtrio shiny.
When it comes to shiny hunting my eyes are like an eagle and the shiny was the mabostiff
A shiny maschiff
I was watching ur video when u see a shiny ✨ gogoat 🐐 and I’m playing my game and then I find a shiny ✨ skiddo😂
19:20 indeed swablu is  best
Don't look at the sandwiches when eating
nokimon the goat
Oh God I hope You can use sandwiches hunting in area zero
got my first shiny before 4k pokemon seen, it is mudbray, tried to get marill shiny, couldn't catch it tho rip marill
You also forgot the shiny mushroom💀💀💀💀
I must say I call The north province the land of dragons it is by far my absolute favorite place to shiny hunt I've gotten so many
i feel your pain, i got 3 shiny pawmi
I REALY WANTED A SHINY GYARADOS SO I GOT LIKE 12 SHINY MAGICARP BUT I DIDNT KNOW THEY WERE SHINY AND I KILLED THEM ALL
i love that you  use zelda tunes :) the wind waker one got me lol perfect for the beach due to the setting of that game.
YO THANK YOU FOR THESE POSTS I CANT FIND ONE VIDEO OF YOURS I HAVENT WATCHED THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU
I ran into a floette in area zero and was like not again and then it sparkled .
Finally got my first shiny to day
Yes new episode!!!
When you found legs it reminded me of when I started a battle than ran into a shiny pokemon
merry chirstmas people
Man said where going to do one province per video and then said sike
Please don’t tell me the shiny orange tatsugiri looked like that I think I missed one today😭
also i had NO shiny charm
I found a shiny snorunt in pokemon violet... but it was male. oof.
Oh no don’t do it to me. Don’t play the OSRS music especially hells bells, I don’t need to fall back into a deep dark addiction.
I saw that maschiff instantly I think you just weren’t familiar with its shiny so you glossed over it
I got 15 Shinys in one day😅
I saw it I saw it its a mashstiff
i know how mimikyu would be easy play on invert color
A fellow shiny Bouncesweet enjoyer I see
Technically, TECHNICALLY... the mountain around area 0 has unique spanws like garchomp and magnezone
Yeah! I’ve been waiting for this mommelt for EVER!
Bro I’m so proud of myself that I saw the maschiff, I saw the cluster and new bc of where the “rock” was positioned
I got it it is madstiff
Mabostiff shiny cus I have one
I found it is that dog Pokémon The one that has a Pokédex entry saying that kids would laugh at face when they are sad
The Maschiff wasn’t the only one you missed lol idk if it was the lighting but 10:06 the Mabostiff looks like it was also shiny
you gotta use Ricordando il passato in the next shiny fail i beg it would be hilarious
Ok THIS was definitely a fun video to watch while shiny hunting of my own!! The editing was amazing 👏🏼
24:04 does someone know where is this OST from ?
Got my first shiny today. It was a s olive that I was wanting on my team and after like five mins i saw it under a tree. (I wasn’t even hunting it I was just looking for a higher level)
You should make a sequel that's just called "going back to get my axew, scovillan and snowrunt cause I didn't get them in the area lock challenge"
these videos are amazing mixing osrs video series with the pokemon game ive enjoyed the most lately! thanks and happy holidays!!
Cyclizar is probably the most stress-inducing shiny hunt I've ever done. I did it in an outbreak during my second playthrough cause I just had to have a full shiny team. It was a good 20-30 minutes of constantly scanning the oncoming tidal wave of Cyclizar (the outbreak caused most of them to run in one direction) and dodging as many as I could...  But I did find it. It now resides on my Scarlet team.
i saw the shiny les go it was in the heard of maschiff and the mabostiff one of the maschiffs were shiny
You are by far the best pokemon creator iv ever seen good job man you give us hype !!!
Marenie was the first shiny I got in the game!
10:16 Maschiff
Is the last episode Catching All Paradox Pokémon?
I have been watching noki since arceus came out and the fact I’ve seen him grow from 90k subs to 204k subs is amazing well done noki and I hope you had a great Christmas
Why does his game not look awful😭
Just got this  for christmas less gooo
I'm addicted to the intro lmao
This channel is gonna hit 1mil subs in 2023 i know it
when he drove past the dragon raid den there was a shiny Drowzee in the bush
Little dog
Osrs music goes hard
He missed mabosstiff shiny
For west province area one, I hunted fo0r a shiny Skiddo with encounter power, title power and sparkling power at level 3 for grass types. I found one in less than 7 minutes. It also had the rare mark. Be jealous!
Prediction: they're getting all the paradoxes
10:12 shiny pup
So did he just forget there are 4 seas that are areas also?
I know you failed it but can you try to find a shiny shroodle
your friend was like STOP!!! STOPPPP TURN AROUND RIGHT NOW
Was that a shiny maschiff I saw?
the dog
The getting faked-out by a normal mon looking like a shiny has never been so true... Case in point: Spending upwards of 18 hours hunting for a Frigibax in an outbreak
i can't wait for the next video 😫😫😫
one of my favorite youtubers fr
I too, have a shiny Rellor... but mine has the Sleepytime mark! Quite fitting, as I went on to name it Thoth!
This channel feels queer coded, are you a friend of Dorothy?
The luck part, thanks to this video I found the shiny I was hunting for in a different game, shiny Dialga (no master ball like you, just timer ball) and I almost killed it with a critical hit (almost is the key word).
Watched the whole thing. Amazingly entertaining.
Still got the Wugtrio! Perfect ending!
Dang those sandwhich making struggles were too realteable.. 😭  Congrats on all the shinies man, brilliant video!
On the Gogoat, I will fight anyone to the ends of the earth to argue that shiny Skiddo is the best shiny ever.
I’m guessing that for the final video he’s going to get every shiny paradox Pokémon.
You are just getting better and better
Maschiff was the shiny at 10:30
Shiny Varoom came in like "Omae was mou shindeiru"
To be honest idk why you game is bugging to much. After week 1 I haven’t encountered ANY bugs.
The very same thing happened to me with my shiny Varoom, lmao.
I like how the shiny Varum just ran straight into him
10:12 was shiny small dog
I knew this series gave me Runescape vibes then I heard the background music!! Great series for sure
Funny how you call it Lagtree Thicket. :D in German it's called "Schmierhain" and from our first visit there we started calling it "Laghain" x)
Noki pls notice us!
Noki please notice us!
10:12 doggo
Bro this series is so good. Legitimately top tier Pokémon content.
HUGE Oldschool Runescape vibe, big W!
I found a mass outbreak of mimikyu and found one before it was even close to finished, I didn’t have any shiny charm or sandwich boost
this comment has under 10 likes lol
It was maschiffs
Playing pokemon Violet and want to complete the dex anyone want to help? Missing only paradox pokemon, stonejouner and palafin. Help would be much appreciated. Will trade back only want them to complete dex.
YOU NEED TO POST THE NEW ONE NOW
Shiny dog?!!!!!!!!??!!!
Haha. I got a shoutout.😂
noki you should make a discord server !! i’m sure me and tons of others would love to join :)
Loki on, you missed a shiny larvesta at 4:29
11:59 it's a flabébé
Is it the oinkCologne?
I thought I was the only one that called it lagtree thicket.
I found my first shiny of Violet in East area 3 a torcoal
It was a shiny maboshtiff
0:23 someone please tell me the song, it just hit hard
I love the improvement of videos man! The music, the intro, it's so cool man! Keep them up, I love these vids :)
21:04 Stickerbrush Symphony in an icy setting????? (brain malfunctions) You have weird taste in BGM choice. LOL
I AM SOO HAPPY I SAW THAT SHINY
Shiny Machiff at 10:12, left corner
I love all the runescape music in the background
you're very fruity
Maschiff
HE MISSED A SHINY CYCLIZAR
Best series content in SV game
15:50 bro was on mission a mission to get in the video and sent to the box
The Vroom thing combined with the Mareanie thing happened 2 my friend with a Maschiff she just went 2 talk 2 me cuz we were at dinner and a purple dog she didn’t notice ran into her. I was like YOU FOUND A SHINY?! You didn't tell me! My friend didn’t even know it was shiny until I told her that it was XD
I kinda like shiny sneasler,  but what up with GF making shiny ice types pee snow color?
Yeah, anytime I catch the random glimpse of a shiny or a gimmeghoul it definitely feels like a super power lol. That or optimized adhd lol.
I want the 10 hours of mareanie footage
I'm tired of watching shiny pawmi getting thrown at people! Wheres my shiny pawmi!?
8:45 Your game really just glitched in a shiny lmao
You didnt struggle atall. Dissapointed..
Your videos give me motivation to shiny hunt (only to give up 30minutes in)
Takes me like 10 min per shiny
Yep, I saw a shiny maschif in the clip!
me: hunts for shinies for hours, doesn't find any My cousin: doesn't go shiny hunting, steps into a new area and immediately finds shiny  😅😢😢😢
12:18 YOU CAN WHAT
I got Pokémon Scarlet for Christmas. Koraidon is adorable :) um so anyway I got a shiny fletching before my first Pokémon center I’m very happy :)
Just got my second shiny in scarlet after catching the Titan great tusk, a rufflet that appeared as I was catching great tusk super happy it didn’t despawn.
Noki you have became one of my favorite youtubers and definitely my favorite Poketuber. I love your videos and I only hope you continue to rise. You really make shiny hunting enjoyable to watch!
found it
Bro I was walking through Area 3 in the Western Province, and I encountered something but right next to me was a frickin’ shiny Tropius
I think I may be really lucky because I have never experienced lag in Pokemon Violet
Öö
Good job! Area zero is cool although I only have a shiny croagunk. I want to get more.
oh no! i can't believe you missed the maschiff. i love him so much. also i did not realize that the woods area was part of casseroya lake. i thought it was a different area entirely
Noki when you got that  pawmi right in the back there was another shiny pawmi pls reroll
imagine if you were hunting for a shiny pokemon that was really common in that area but then you find the rarest pokemon in that areas shiny which ends up having the worst shiny in the game
I say the shiny in the ten second clip
Mabstff
😹😹😹
Pokémon: You Choose Me
Fun story: on my way to the grass gym for the first time, I accidentally ran over a Nymble. I had never seen one before that. It was green, but I didn’t know it was a shiny until the sparkles. I caught it, but I was totally panicking. And I used Crix for the rest of the game. (First time I’ve ever beaten a Pokémon game with a shiny, let alone one caught before the first gym)
@nokimon I’m pretty sure u missed two shinies at 10:24 just pause it and I think it’s a shiny drowsy
10:23 I thought the shiny was there, next to the blue crystal
Merry Chrismast Nokimon and Happy Holiday😁😁 Also the shiny game is actually shiny Maschiff.......
Fungus Among us
I actually started this myself after the first video came out, Including the sub areas. Im currently 1 locations away from finishing
One was yellow the rest were orange I can’t copy and paste on mobile tho
You missed a shiny paw i at the first area
All of these videos are top notch. Great job!
What about paldean seas
In the moment that you found the shiny Maschiff I saw a shiny foongus
amazing video and amazing luck 🙌🏻
Now I know why he’s named revaroom
222200th
Avarage mei,calaba and arezu fan:🤓🤓🤓  Avarage sabi,volo and ingo fan:😎😎😎
Here in the first 21 hours.
10:23 im not familiar with that area too much but that pink and white thing in that bush behind the tera raid den.....is that another shiny you missed cuz it looks like oinkologne but i could be way off
How
The exact moment you were talking about a shiny snorunt I found one myself in my second playthrough 😂🥶😅
I found a shiny snesel uhhh I think I found it on Friday and in the mountains
Love the shiny Steene, Tsareena was the first shiny I got from Dynamax Adventures in SW/SH and I built her up competitively. Awesome work, Noki. Keep up the FANTASTIC content!
The excitement I had when I first encountered a shiny Cyclizar running pass by me while I was beating up a stupid Tauros that won’t stop headbutting my ass 😭 Luckily it didn’t stray far enough for it to despawn
Gogoat is only in scarlet violet and x and y
go to  18:50 i think he missed a shiny indeedee
I literally found 3 shinies in 15 minutes before the first gym lol
in one of the patches of the 3 dog bois on the right and the tropius was on the left
the weird snow you talked about is diamond dust the special snow introduced in diamond pearl and platinum pretty much only for those games and the remakes (we dont talk about the remakes)
Thanks for shiny hunting my favorite pokemon, Toxapex! I respect you champ!!
Noki I found a shiny shroodle in your screen area one
Couldn't you just use autobattle to check on shinies?
Love the series keep on going
Wait didn’t you say no sandwiches
LOL I'm so glad someone else saw the "Jeans" on shiny scovillain!
Eastern Province Area 2 has my best shiny luck by far. I have gotten easily 8+ shinies there in with only 1 duplicate shiny
Have a massive feeling area zero is gonna be EVERY pokemon being shiny
I'm calling it the area zero hunt will be all paradox pokemon  Edit: I just finished watching the video and I just want to say I fucking knew it
Maschiff!
This series is too good to be true , I love this. I thought maybe i will put up this video im background and complete the pokedex but this video didnt let me focus on the game as it was so amazing , reallyy excited for Area Zero Shinies
keep up the great work also mind sharing your luck with us also also im pretty sure the shiny in the clip was mabosstiff
Man i have 40 houres in this game and no shinies 🥲🥲
You see when I was about to sleep nokimon released a new video so i woke up
10 sec clip game, wow that Maschiff looks great, did it do something to it's fu.. NO WAIT WHERE ARE YOU GOING!!
yo is this guy cheating
You need to get axew
9:27 IS THAT ANOTHER SHINY PAWMI IN THE BACKGROUND?
gosh i caught two Venomoths in Area Zero  the first one i just went in there and 10 after there was my first shiny Venomoth and 20 minuts after a second one, bruh shiny hunting is broken edit: and i think i spell some words wrong 🗿
I really enjoy and love these kind of videos. They are very entertaining and motivating ☺️
Noki da 🐐 no 🧢
I found the shiny maschiff in the clip at 10:12
10:08 suspicious shiny drowzee
i see im not the only one whos been rammed by a shiny varoom..... it caught me off by surprise too
In area 3 of the eastern side you are the hunted 1
Can you hunt a shiny ditto, Zorua and zoroark next and some more :) good luck on that btw
Mandjtv also says lagtree thicket
Throw ur pokemon to the pokemons which may look like the same just like mimikyu cuz if u throw ur pokemon and it doesnt attack it, its a shiny
10:05 shiny mabostiff? (I forgot it’s name a little but it looks kinda purple to the right)
1:45 How dare you insult the Mint Chip Monkee
1:40 bro is dead af💀
Sandygast: Crying in the corner
I got shinny froslass today my fav Pokémon funny you hunted for a snowrunt in this episode. LOL . Merry Christmas
During the shiny Maschiff part, was the Mabosstiff at the beginning not shiny as well?
Dog
I was waiting lol
Dude, as someone who was also hunting shiny Mimikyu and took a whole week to find them, I envy but also happy for your amazing luck.
Merry Christmas Nokimon (not anymore lol) I just wanted to let you know that this has inspired me to attempt this myself. I've also included sub-areas like Inlet Grotto and have so far found 7 shinys. Thanks for the inspiration  Edit: also, are you doing the Seas?
Stenee and Marinea  Man that sounds like a big duo  Batman Robin you got nothing on this
Bruh I only have found 2 shinies.
I bet you during the area 0 hunt, he will have to get all paradox Pokémon shiny
EYY Wake up nokimon realesed a new video
If you sub to Nokimon, the shinys will find you.
MOM DAD YOU GAVE ME A NOKIMON VIDEO FOR CHRIMA??? HELL YEAH
Lol, swablu was my first full odds shiny ✨️ in scarlet
I am upset I just found your channel, your videos are amazing! so underrated! you’ve just earned a new subscriber! Good luck on the rest of the journey, you got this, looking forward to more of the series. Like I said insanely underrated, top tier videos!
I have a charmander I’m looking to trade for a high level to help with the elite four
love ur vids
Anyone else see the shiny Mabostiff at 10:05?
I also hunted axew, but unlike him I got it, second egg masuda method
shiny dogg
I found a shiny skitto in my second playthrough of Violet and I love it sm! This video, definitely makes me want to shiny hunt more.
God moda fukin dam this is so hype and your video editing is AMAZING to hype me even more
pause here 10:24  There’s a shiny oinklogne as well
The dog is shiny 😂😂😂😂
Thr way you handled the cylizar situation is the same way i handled it
Shiny Maschiff
Love the content man
I got a shiny zorua earlier today after a painful couple days of autobattling everything and that’s probably the hardest shiny for me so far, the easiest relative to how hard it’s supposed to be was shiny antique sinistea which I got a little after my first sandwich and I’ve been happy about that for the last several days
It so hard to shiny hunt in area zero
Hi
boosted odds?? I guess i dont have the shiny charm cuz im a casual but wow..
I CANT STOP GETTING SHINY GOGOATS THEY KEEP COMING TO ME
merry christmas noki i love you <3
its a maschiff like 5-6 seconds in by the cliff of that 10 second clip
mashiff
after failing my shiny droopy form tatsugiri (i have the other two forms, and i got another goomy which finishes the evo line) i decided i'd try for cyclizar. i saved, tried making a sandwich, and realized i didnt have the right mystica. so i reloaded and went for the sandwich you made. before i made the sandwich, i looked at this taruos family that spawned. i ran into one and it was normal. then i looked at the rest, and ran into another and it was shiny! after that i saved again, made the sandwich and in less than 10 min i found another taruos and a meowth! i didnt see a cyclizar, but i'll try one more time before grinding for mystica.
I WAITED FOR THIS
how do you check how long you sandwich effects last ?
Love this guys Chanel just found it and now I wait for every episode
HEY! YOU! After watching this video, and before this video, I got a shiny Paldean Wooper, AND I got a shiny Flittle in the Asado Desert!!!! THANK YOU FOR THE SHINY LUCK
Everybody complains about lag I have not lag once
I’m both confused and happy- cus you shiny hunted mimikyu but it’s not from gen 9-?
Dat maschiff though
Good luck! I just caught my own shiny Tarantoula. :)
I kind of want to do this challenge myself, do you have any tips? Doubt you'll see this but it's worth a shot.  i've been mainly mesuda method hunting, current hunt is for an oricorio ( one of my favorite mons ), so changing it up after hatching boxes of eggs looking for a slightly teal bird would be nice...
Ended up watching this while I did my own shiny hunt. Found myself a shiny Iron Hands literally two sweeps through the first zone in Area Zero!  Now I wish you positive vibes with your upcoming search for all the Area Zero mons, because goodness knows I don't think I could even get close lolol
Lol I was shiny hunting magnetometer when I found a random shiny sneasel.
let me guess for area zero yr gonna catch every shiny paradox mon? (i wrote this before the end of the vid lmao)
I'm fairly certain finding your videos increased my shiny luck DRASTICALLY. I did not find a single shiny pokemon my first play through, story and post game: 0 Shinies battled. I made my second character (made a different character for each starter) and was still debating her team when I found your channel. Watched the 100 hour video and first area locked and subscribed. That day I made a joke about looking for shinies like you do, and Smoliv was one of the pokemon I was debating being on character 2's team. First group of Smoliv to spawn, front Smoliv had a different colored Olive. (Also got a shiny Rufflet and Forretress.)  After beating the game as her (not same day) I went back to my main character to catch version exclusives and send them through surprise trade. While doing this I see a red ball in the corner of my eye. I'm like "oh, Voltorb, better keep an eye out for a blue ball" but as a white ball walked up to the red one I realized "voltorb doesn't spawn in this area". Today, after watching this video I got on my third character (new character, only 1 badge) and I found a shiny Rookidee. All three of my characters first shinies were full odds, and were AFTER watching your videos.
I’ve been trying to hatch a shiny Wooper for 48+ hours *still suffering* also amazing video I’ve only started watching your content for a couple of days now and you make really good videos keep up the good work!
Im so glad this channel blew up. These videos are so good
I remember his old pokemon legins of acrceos vids
I enjoyed the video but ngl, i think you might just be blind sometimes 💀
If you check the summary on your toedscool, you might find its from "Socarrat trail", which the game counts as a separate area from the larger lake.  if that was intentional, uh, oops!  mrry crms
10:12 (don’t know the exact time) that right there is a shiny doggo, a very good boi
Merry Christmas ❤❤
Shoutout to the ones who shiny hunted marinie in S/M ✊ oh how far we’ve come
Ay bro your trending I’m so proud of u and how far u have come I have been here since before 20K and it’s so cool to see how far u have come this may sound wierd from someone u don’t know but congrats noki
Helloo brooo so much days later
20:47 nah you're right, Shiny Gogoat is goated
I saw it
Gogoat is one of my favourite pokemon
If you’re unsure about a shiny, you can just use the Let’s Go feature to auto battle them. When auto battling pokemon, your pokemon will refuse to kill shiny pokemon so you can check if its shiny without going into battle.
i still think you should’ve got a shiny grafiyeye
My first hunts in this game were all the Violet paradox Pokémon, and I got all of them in 2 days lmao (would be 1 day if I didn’t decide to start the night before). Although, I did have a shining power sandwich, so it’s not as impressive 😅, but I’m still happy!
Bro you missed a shiny Mabostiff
Mabostiff
At 10:02 there's also a shiny Mabosstiff on the right side of the screen before the ruined building!
broo how did he miss a mabosiff and almost miss a maschiff too
In Russia, the shinies hunt you
W Blue 🫡
Good luck with shiny Iron Valiant. Still can’t believe it but I actually got 2 of them with a single sparkling power boost. Still blown away by that not gonna lie
Call me crazy but isn't the Mabostiff at 10:05 shiny? It's purple?
How’d he get different colored clothing?
Noki got violet by of u and with in 2 hours I got a shiny fletchling and then an hour and a half later I got a pink lechonk
Yayyy🎉 im following this series hahhaa
I'll tell you what, I did a Lurantis/Fomantis hunt, and it was BRUTAL.  BTW how did you do all those camera angles and poses?
Shiny mabostiff
I'm doing the masuda method for cyclizar without the shiny charm
10:14 Maschiff
catching shinies look so easy now, like i spent hundreds of hours back in gen 2 and i think i just come across 1 single wild shiny lol.  it was a super cool shiny sneasel that i obliterated by smashing the A button >.< ... the sadness still remains.
the way you tell stories intrigues me so much like a low budget netflix series that I cant stop binging.
Maschiff
Fantastic video? Do you accept offers for shiny Pokémon. Can I get a shiny doom fist while you are using Kayla ult so I can make the best tft team. K thz
Is it just me or does the tauros at 1:42 look shiny
15:20 I HAD THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPEN, well kinda. I was hunting for a shiny revavroom and I found where they spawned before work, saved my game and turned off the console. 8 hours later after my shift I knocked out 4 revavroom from the outbreak and a lokix assaults me from behind while I’m looking at the possessed motors… I named him pummel
I had a hard time seeing mimikyu as well, had to look at the cheeks to find mine. If they weren’t red, knew it was the shiny.
I'm doing m new playthrough. Where I use  only steel ground and Rock
16:52 I just find it very ironic because it IS hard to notice, yet that was my first shiny in the game. I used the let's go feature on a wild Mimikyu and my Quaquaval refused to fight it. It then clicked that your pokemon won't faint shinies 🤣
I have been shiny hunting mimikyu and have gone through like 10 boost sandwitchs and feel like I have missed 10 shinys
This is the best Christmas presents yet!
the shinny varoom was a noki hunter.
Funny thing is Rellor rolls a giant Gold Ball when shiny, and becomes golden when it evolves
At 4:28 did he miss a shiny rellor
it would of probably been better if they did make zones instead of one open world (not counting the school, or area zero) like have walls between zones but with gates that go between them so yeah a small loading sreen but it would of helped the game from having as much lag and glitches (so a little more like PLA) but idk it works ok only crashed 2 time on me so far and only a few glitches (shadows flickering, so getting stuck but it would tend to fix itself, and a few times turning invisible either my "ride" or my character, and sometimes when fighting pokemon they are inside the ground/cliff face)
10:12 I  spotted maschiff but thought it was mabosstiff's paw for a second edit: 17:14 Mimikyu is not that hard to spot, at least not to me, I went into Tagtree Thicket with a lv. 2 ghost encounter power sandwich, 199 encounters later there she is, little grey mimikyu sticking out among her normal friends
All of them?!??
I have saw a gal are on Zappos when I began scarlet but I did not know that it was a legind so I walk right past it
You are my absolute favorite pokemon content creator. Thank you for all the hard work you put into editing.
NOKI!!!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS AND CONGRATS ON 200K!!!
10:13 Lil’ purp mobster doggie on the left lol.
When hunting for the mimikyu you didnt need to encounter them to check. You can just send a pokemon to autobattle them and your pokemon will refuse to battle shinies.
found it lol
18:40 yoooo ur character is sus bruh chillllll
Let’s be honest, who doesn’t call it “Lagtree Thicket”
I saw the shiny
You’re my fav poketuber
Found it
I found the maschiff who was shiny🎉
I got scarlet for Christmas and not even an hour into my play through I got a shiny shinx  Much happy
Any one gonna tell him that the sea counts as a area too?
omg this video is soooooo good
oh boy time to catch up to you. by doing everything lol
Is it just me or was there 2 shines in that clip
naw the music choice in these videos is insanely good 😭
I accidentally did a lvl 2 flying sandwich and found a shiny bombirdeer
Yes ep 2 finally! Merry Christmas yall
It was a shiny mastchiff I studied my shinys if this game so i can identify them. Good job spotting it!
Love this video series, super inspiring for me and this was such a treat on Christmas! I just wanna say your appreciation for Scovillain is much appreciated! Too many people are calling them ugly and as a shiny Scovillain owner and Scovillain fan, it makes me sad :( Glad you like their lil jeans!
Who wants to tell him Toedscool is on Socorrat Trail and not Casseroya Lake
Noki I love your content so much! I just got Violet for Christmas and caught a shiny hoppip as my first non-scripted encounter :D
I paused the video at 10:12. I spotted it, shiny maschiff to your left
Hey nokimon a shiny drakloak hunted me too
FOUND IT! WAS IT THE GREY POKÉMON NEXT TO THE MABOSMIFF?
the wugtrio shiny looks like the pinguin suit in mario
I've been waiting so eagerly for part 2, I can't believe you actually gave use the remaining main areas in one episode for Christmas, you're the best!
Got my copy of scarlet today and found a shiny magikarp
10:04 - isn't that a shiny Mabostiff?   I honestly thought that was the shiny you were talking about. Then I saw the Shiny Maschiff at 10:12.
Hey Nokimon I think the tera floette is shiny cause the antenna is blue
You should try and get all eeveelutions and all the shiny eeveelutions
the gogoat looks like a pokemon far loki
i love your cotent and have watched since 8k merry christmas and keep it up
At 10:05 you can see he missed a shiny mabostiff right before he catches a shiny maschiff.
Even i had the shiny charm, im still getting no shinies
shiny maschiff on the left at 10:12
Bruh I have been hunting for a shiny varoom for hours. Lucky....
10:12 the michief 🤯
Nokimon today I got my first shiny it was snow and it was marked
The incident with your shiny Varoom happened to me except with shiny Hawlucha. He just pounced out of nowhere. 🤣
Noki the goat 🔥
when i caught i shiny gogoat i fell in love instantly i dont like gogoat as a mon but when i got a shiny i immediately put it on the team
Congrats on 200k!
I know the answer. 39:41
Finally let's goooo best poketuber
As a fellow shiny gogoat owner I can say that shiny gogoat looks really good, not because I have it but because it made me like gogoat a lot more than I thought it would.
i almost instantly spotted the shiny maschiff but to be fair i have one of my own lol
Hehe i noticed the maschiff too >:D guess i rlly should try shiny hunting
AYE BOIS, NOKIMON RELEASE ON THE MOST MAGICAL DAY OF THE YEAR
I gasped at the sight of those shiny's as if playing the game myself. The series is fun
I think the best Christmas gift we can get is the fact all three areas were in one video!
Good vid dude
I picniced shiny hunted for noibat and did something like 50 resets, found no shiny noibat. Found a swablu and golduck thougj
10:07 mabostiff
Man I love this series, I love this game. You inspired me to start shiny hunting in Legends Arceus and now I'm all in for SV too
Small amumgus on the left
Do season2 🔫
I hate Denny’s avulsion likes Denny’s Volgin sucks it has always guided guided me so I’m starting to college stinkily
at my last mareanie I've got a shiny Grimer and a shiny wattrew 🤡 (with outbreak and sparkling power 3)
Why does everyone keep putting shiny locked in the thumbnails??
In the 10 second clip with the maschiff... was that a shiny drowzee next to the raid den or am i going crazy
Amogus
merri krima
Questions, we’re you going to include the water or did you want to keep your hair haha
I don’t usually comment on videos but the floatzel part was amazing
am i crazy or was there a shiny mabosstiff he passed just before the shiny maschiff?? it's at 10:21, apart of the first group by the wall.
The shiny with the 10 second video was with the big dog like Pokémon, I forgot what there where called.
I’m personally offended that you didn’t catch legs in a premier ball, it PERFECTLY matches the colour scheme
Face reveal at 500k?
“Wait Nokimon uploaded?”  “Always has been.”
Shiny maschiff 10:12
I go a shiny wiglett the second I ended a picnic
I love this series <3 great vid noki:))) merry xmas man
My guy got hunted by a shiny car engine
Seeing you catch that shiny Cyclizar makes me miss Minirai, the one I caught but lost to a crash.
Tagtree Thicket utterly trolled me during my Mimikyu hunt.
Bro the same thing happened to me with the same shiny it was night in my game and I couldn’t see the shiny but also that light purple with black fur of mabosstifs pre evo is nice
Love this series
man you make these so entertaining.
Tbf, Casseroya Lake and the Socarrat Trail are included in the Northern Province. Mostly indicated by the music. However, that matters little. Since you still caught a Shiny there.   What I will say is that areas like Alfornada Cavern, Inlet Grotto, Socarrat Trail, and South/East/West/North Paldean Sea are their own separate areas as indicated in the Pokémon's summary.  Whether that matters or not, your choice ig. Luckily, you don't have to swim within the lake itself, as the perimeter (not including Socarrat Trail) is included as being part of the Lake Casseroya area.  But in regards to the Paldean Sea areas... I can understand you completely skipping them.
Let’s go part 2,excited about part 3!
BlueVacktor: The hero who saved Nokimon and shiny maschiff 😁
Been checking if this video came out literally every single day since the last video 😂 !!!!!!
you missed the shiny dog
Doing that 10 second comment thing, I see a shiny Mabosschiff I think.
Never mind
In 10:33 he missed two shinys
In 10:33 he missed two shinys
Shroomish
That magnetons not bugged he just curious
It's the maschiff
I'm honestly admired by how far this channel in what felt so quick, so keep doing you Noki, you the best
the maschiff at 10:12
Ah yes, i just got Violet myself today and now time to sit back and watch Nokimon suffer as i too suffer trying to find a Shiny Eevee :,) (shiny umbreon is my second favorite pokémon)
on 14:56/25:01 was a shiny dog on the group on the right
Happy Holidays Noki
Idk if my eyes were playing tricks, but was there a shiny mabosstiff  before the maschief was shown?
I love this guys content it’s super funny seeing people that have better luck than I do
This video is my Christmas present
This video has made me realise just how many pawmis exist in paldea
Help I got the game today and I’m not getting any great Pokémon I have loads of amazing Pokémon in shield but at least someone traded me a lvl 78 mimiku
Noki my first shiny was shiny Iron Valliant!
I'm currently shiny hunting Scream Tail in area zero, and the glowing crystals faked me out so much. It perfectly makes the body of scream tail look light purple, with 'hair' being more saturated purple, and from a distance I can't tell the eye color.
maschiff
I must say,  great shiny taste
My game is breaking to 12:03 😭😭😭
Congratulations on 200k
Crazy story: Got Pokemon Scarlet today. Played for the first time... Ran around for a bit: and I saw a pokemon that was... off. I wondered "do they have gender differences?" Nope. I got a shiny Fidough on my first encounter with one.
I'm probably wrong but i think the clip had a shiny maschiff
love the runescape background music :)
Kanto you hunt the shiny in Paldi, the shiny hunt you 15:30
Dude this video must've bine so life draining XD
Shiny masschiff
Mabbostiff
Good thing you're hunting in Violet. Roaring Moon is a very sucky hunt.
Shiny maschiff!
Shiny sneasel in this game was my first shiny ✨ EVER
No wonder episode two took so long
Nice vid! Dosuka did the same thing a few weeks ago. Looks like a hard challenge :p
So your just gonna skip North Paldean Sea, East Paldean sea, South Paldean sea and West Paldean Sea on the area locked shiny hunt?
gooooo-goat
Shiny Maschiff!
Found the shiny
merry christmas!!! i just got a switch and pokémon violet and i am loving them both so much so far
Rellor was one of my first shinies. 15 minutes later I got a shiny murkrow
Shiny Maschiff!
At 10:21 the Mabostiff on the right also looks like a shiny I got really confused when I saw it, I thought it was the answer.
Shiny maschiff!! I noticed it because I accidentally stumbled onto one of them in a group on two separate locations so I know that shiny well Also I just like that shiny because the OG colours of maschiff are vile
Every time I watch ur videos, it inspires me to shiny hunt, but I get (very much so) dissapointed with my results
10:12 purple dog. I assume that's the one you're referring too.  Edit: Okay, it was.
LETS GOO I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
I lost my shiny flittle 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The dog
My biggest pain was to have the time to get a Pokémon to make my cyclizard sleep to catch him with a beast ball
I can’t wait for episode 3
CONGRATS ON 200K NOKI!!! absolutely deserved, your videos are so entertaining and well done, this one being no exception! really excited to see what's coming up!
Childrens Game??
Noki tysm for this
I’m glad I’m not the only one who adores Shiny Steenee. In fact, I actually found 2 shiny Steenee’s with the same Sandwhich.
Once in Pokémon violet I saw a shiny manky ,but I killed it😢
your videos are just so fun to watch. the way you edit and tell the story is really soothing and makes these shiniest way more interesting, since their story is told so unique. really cool content, love it (+ you're a fellow Umineko lover🤭)
Thanks for the RS music :)
Canttty wait for episode 3
All his videos are like a cinema makes me wanna meet him irl
The dedication is crazy
Maschiff!!
Bro I've been waiting for this video
You said you got something crazy planned for area zero? Can I guess? I bet it's black and white shiny hunting right?
It's always a good day when nokimon uploads, especially when it's chirsmas
i have spent. literal days. trying to get. that stupid beetle Because I wanted my first beetle for the pokedex to be shiny, so I had no shiny charm, no shiny sandwiches, and my dumb ass used a ground type sandwich first !!   Ended up giving up. I’ll go back for him now that I have finished the game. Your three minute shiny has rejuvenated me!!
I’m the 200,000th subscriber! Congratulations!
Ty for cheering up my christmas nokimon
You stole lagtree thicket from mandjtv
Your toxipex encounter reminds me of my first shiny in this game, I ended up going AFK for like an hour and a half and my friend walks over and he says hey why is that Pokemon a different color I looked back and it was a shiny
Bro, the first video was just area 1, and now we're already getting all other 3? That's quick
I hate you... your luck isn't fair lol
I wasnt able to find the shiny pokemon in the clip soooo my geuss is ditto
Omg I was hunting for a shiny Marianne on that beach lol! Unfortunately I have yet to find one but congrats!
u forgot to do each of the seas north west east and south

Floatzel was the first shiny I got
Gogoat is pretty epic

Masstif
10:20 See that mabostiff? I think it’s also shiny. Looks a bit more purple.
Noki didn’t hunt the shiny Varoom, the shiny Varoom hunted Noki.
PART TWO PART TWO PART TWO PART TWO I GOR POKEMON SCARLET TODAY AHHHH EVERYTHING IS PERFECT
For area 0 he’s going to be catching all of the paradox Pokémon.Calling it
how do you stream your game to discord? i would love to do that with my friends
Blue and Noki are friends?! That brings me so much joy.
Dude, I loved the Vídeo, but I waited that a video like this world be longer, 25 minutes for 3 areas is kinda cringe, but it is a great video
A shiny masterpiece
I saw it. That’s unfortunate
I love this series, I wish it would never end
I think you missed a shiny
Wait I just realized Noki could get 200k subs for Christmas ITS SO CLOSE RN  I’m gifting a sub from me as a present to go closer to the 200k goal woooooo  Edit: MERRY CHRISTMAS 200K LETZ GOOOOOO
Hope you have a good Christmas nokimon
Nokimon be like, Time to wake up and shiny hunt all day
I was watching this when I accedentily ran into a mastobiff and it was a shiny zoark
When I was shiny hunting for a shiny Varoom, I got him in 1 sec after making the sandwich for poison after that I try to get a shiny Wooper but fail.
Menace to the Shiny economy
I’m so glad this came out! Merry Christmas and happy holidays :)
12:06 oh so that’s how iono came to be
Love seeing more people get the shiny Varooms driving into them! I was driving through the area and one spawned in just to immediately drive into me, but for me it was from the front so I saw it spawn and everything. All my friends hate me for it! XD
10:12 Maschiff I see him Purple boi 😊
Lagtree thickit. Hmmmm where have I seen this before.  Oh right he STOLE IT FROM MANDJTV
I ain't had much lag playing this
Wel done with all the shines
Noki: Although I Like To Call Him Legs Me: Look at them legs
I literally caught my first shiny in scarlet while watching this vid.  It was a Shiny yungoos
In east province area two in my play though i found a garados and marene back to back
This is an amazing Christmas gift
Little tip; the reason your game is getting riddled with bugs like those is because you havent closed out of it in a few days. I experienced similar bugs while leaving it run for many days. These issues are due to a memory leak, eventually the game will force close. Do your game a favour and close it every few hours or so
Its already Christmas Eve 😫
the maschf :[
IM LATE NOOOO
I like your style. Would you mind sharing your customization settings for your character?
Wow... impressive
That was a purple dog
Nokimons got the best poke content right now, keep it up!!
The tiny dog next to mabostiff with the crooked neck is your shiny
19:51 yesterday I was grinding for kinggambit and you know what happened, no sandwiches, no shiny charms, I ran into the golden chainsaw cricket
10:17 it’s a shiny Mastiff
SUB TO NOKIMON HES ALMOST TO 200K LOVE YIUR VIDS NOKIMON
Nokimon you do realise you can change pokemonses pokeballs
10:06 Can't really identify but, ain't that (the pink thing next to the blue crystal) a shiny male Oinkologne? Or is it a Tinkatuff? Really hard to tell thanks to the grass covering the thing up
merry christmas to u to noki also LOVE the vids
Found the shiny before you said it! Shiny Maschiff in a group along with a Mabosstiff.
shiny gogoat is my damn nemesis.  i've found SEVEN of them just randomly running around.  i can't get away from them
I think that shiny was a maschiff, idk just a guess
10:20 aint that a shiny drowzee at the crystal?
Merry Christmas and pre-congrats on 200k! It’s so cool to see your channel taking off like this!
It was the dog
Here before 200k!!!
I wonder why I see people lagging in pokemon, and then I wonder why I don't have these issues
It’s massiff
17:16 venomoth works the same
Idk why you always complain about the game. Have yet to experience any bugs or lag with 60+ hours played
A maschiff
The best thing that happened for me this Christmas thank u nokimon and merry Christmas
Happy holidays
If you go to cascarrafa and go to the bottom left Pokémon center you can make an encounter sandwich for fighting and town reset on the edge
It is the purple do
YESSSS I WAS WAITING FOR THIS
yes
Does anyone else get as excited as me when you see a new nokimon vid when you open YouTube
Dog
Prediction: he will catch every paradox Pokémon in area zero  Edit:I just made it to the end of the video I was right
I saw it right away! But only because I encountered that shiny early game and initially thought it was a gender color difference like hippopotas. That was my second shiny of the game that I caught.
What’s the song when he catches the floatzel from
I found it that little gosht dog its normal form is orange Aslo merry Christmas bro keep up the good work can't wait for the next video
shiny cluster Maschiff
for all of the content creators using Noki’s videos as a blueprint for their own, credit him
CONGRATS ON 200K EARLY GANG
Hope Santa gives you all the shinies you dreamed of getting for Christmas. Merry Christmas!
it was the dog, that u missed and ur friend saw, also im a bit sad u didnt hunt any of the zourarks or zourua
I f*cking popped off once you told us about the Maschiff. I paused the vid right as u rode by it, and was like "Is that a shiny Maschiff or a regular Maboschiff
I think you missed a shiny fraxure
When he saw the shiny gogoat made me sad cause I failed one
The veroom said the shiny hunter was hunted
i get being lucky. but honestly I really think you play it up for the video the speed at which you find these are just lies
Great video as always! Can't wait to see what happens in area zero!
shiny slowbro is my beloved child
found it shiny maschif
Is it just me or is nokimon is the best pokèmon creator of all time
The way you use the character expressions is amazing!
I love your vids noki
15:45 In soviet paldea, you don't hunt shiny. Shiny hunts you
The shiny varoom made me laugh out loud 🤣
Since I've started this challenge myself, I honestly wanted to compare to how you did, and honestly I'm dor doing so bad. Wish you a Merry Christmas and a happy New Years to everyone here!
10:09 , i think its the mabosstif , but It is insted , a zorua  Edit , ok It wasn't :(
Machine
Try shiny hunt mymykyu with the gray scale setting on the switch
You are my new fav YouTuber
At 10:12 you passed the funny shiny dog, spotted it first try without issue. Or so I think.
They past a shiny Sneeal
I’m a guy with glasses and haven’t watched the full video yet but, A Maschiff was lookin a bit SUS 🤔
GET THIS MAN TO 200K!
Mischief?
Part 2 let’s GOOOO
Something about THIS specific channel is just… special. It’s amazing that this guy spends so much of their time to make these vids for us
Merry Christmas
No it’s maschiff
Is it muk or grimer
lmaoooooo Charlie standing on the beach. I thought he looked like TheJustinFlynn tbch
I saw that Maschiff in the clip, but I also had the advantage of being told to look for a shiny so idk how fair it is to hold against you lol
gotta appreciate shiny gogoat, shiny skiddo was my first shiny this game
I’m the 10 second clip it was manostiff right at the beginning
I had a great Christmas,new phone and POKÉMON VIOLET!
17:42 We had the exact same reactions lol. The plain and simple "huh" at the same time as my plain and simple "huh" really had me laughing for a minute
Let me guess you're gonna have to get a shiny of every paradox pokemon
I got a shiny Cylizar by accident !!!!
merry christmas
Bro i was watching this video and farming raids then all of a sudden the second you found a shiny i found a shiny cufant. What a coincedence😊😊😊😊😊
It was the maschiff
THE DOG THE DOG IS SHINY
I'm doing this too and just got through south province yesterday. I'm in west now.
Ive been putting off cyclizar for my living dex because of these exact reasons, nice catch!
Yay I’ve already got all shinies so it will be cool to see my favourite shiny Pokémon YouTuber accomplish this (hopefully)
That shiny little angry dog 😂
these videos make me so happy even when i feel sick or down
I just caught a shiny Great Tusk!
BEST CHRISTMAS GIFT EVER
Maschiff
I got on my switch around the steenee shiny and not even a minute into playing scarlet I got shiny slither wing and it had a uncommon mark lol ong this happened
Merry Christmas 🎄
I’ve caught two shiny snorunts and both were male. I traded the second to a friend for his shiny male salandit. Life is truly pain.
I just got the shiny charm, I’m going to do this exact same challenge because of how fun you made it look! I give all of the luck I have to you, for area zero!
purple tiger idk what the Pokemon name is lol ( the 10 sec clip)
love the videos!
In both games
The shiny was a shiny maschiff
Wug
I just cannot get enough of this videos. Keep it up Noki
Nokimon. Nokimon. Nokimon! NOKIMON! YEAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH MY MY CHIRSTMAS HAS JUST GOT BETTER!
Everyone commenting U DONT NEED TOP OF SANDWHICH BREAD  Me calling u out   U deleting the comment  Me telling you IT DOESNT MATTER IT LOOKS BETTER  U scrolling acting like u didnt see this
17:00 omg its me 😱
“That they hunt for me now…”  By far the best quote ever from Nokimon 😂
Wohoo finally i enjoyd so much The first video of Area locked
Shiny gogoat looks like Loki. Also you could have tested the Mimikyus with auto Battle. Snorunt is my fav Pokemon BTW
I would say my luck is absurd, because I’ve found 4 full odds all on accident
I found shiny I see...  10:12... almost look like rock.
New video idea. Catch  every pokemon  shiny ✨️
For the maschiff province with the whole buildup I was really expecting you to have found a shiny ditto, since they spawn there and don’t appear as shiny in the overworld
Maschiff was my first ever shiny in the game so I immediately saw it! Lol
more nokimon content 🦔 quickly became one of my favorite channels and inspired me to start shiny hunting i love this series and the quizzes
I caught a shiny marenie on the island in area 2 whilst not even trying to shiny hunt. Love the series and the channel
I saw the shiny in the 10 sec clip that was WAY easier than I thought
Shiny floatzel is special to me. I'm no shiny hunter. I don't have the patience. I was just going crazy when I got the verticle climb ability for miridon in violet and I went to the top of one of the mountains and just had to stop and do a double take because I just saw a yellow buizel. It was I guess what's considered full odds and I sat there for like a full 2 minutes registering it.
i hate tarountula
it rolls around poo
Love your vids man
An amazing Christmas Present! Thank you! Your editing and landscape shots really inspire me
Merry Christmas Noki
12:02 is the lag spike
I saw that black Maschiff!! On the left hand side, for just a moment!
I’m pretty sure that the first mabostiff was shiny
17:28 This was me when I was shiny hunting for my Frosmoth 😭 The lighting of the game made it incredibly hard to tell if it was actually yellow so I spent hours just trying to get it and during sunset it’s 10 times worse because they almost all look shiny
i love your videos
You should do this but you have to catch every Pokémon in that area
Yo Noki I think there’s a shiny mabosstiff at 10:05
Cool
Ay you the worst, West Province Area 3 for LIFE
With the thing about zooming out the camera, for me at least, it actually lessens your fov lol. Like I can see further but the render distance is worse for Pokémon, raid crystals etc.
Only got the dislike for the shiny marenie
15:30 Omg, the same thing happened to me, but with a Scyther at the lake. I was getting ready to leave when a Scyther ran into me, and it was a shiny one
Merry chrimmas   If you're reading this hope you're well and  people love you!
im so happy to see someone else experince the pain of shiny hunting mimikyu in the shades
he makes shiny hunting look so easy. or maybe it is and im just too lazy to do all teh stuff required to increase the chances of a shiny encounter but.. NAAHH, surely not
Not the purple maschiff I had to replay the clip where I thought I saw it then I saw it it’s such a good shiny
I got annilhilape as my first shiny of gen 9
Ngl this series is amazing I should try this since I got the charm yesterday
im still shiny hunting marinie
what is the pokemon in the bush a 10:23 ? it looks a lot like shiny Oinkologne
Lol same here.   I have over 100, naturally caught from Nov. 18th the release date when I first started my game.  Bahaha too easy and NO Shiny Charm yet.   My first shiny on this game was a Shinx I caught right after leaving The School.   My most recent Shinies was The Starters I bred and A Shiny Blue Venomoth I randomly encountered  in Area Zero with a few others.   Then came a Shiny Finizen who is now evolved and on my team as Palafin and he is now replacing my Shiny Quaquaval w/Moxie because he is better.  Much better.    I actually like the Shiny Hunting in Gen 9 it is refreshingly random. Okay....Shiny Cyclizar is my next goal.
while it may not be christmas for me anymore (im six hours ahead) it's still a good treat for the day after :))
honestly love watching these not just for the shinies but the runescape music
The amount of dedication this man puts in his videos is insane
the mabostiff on the left @10:11-10:12
Shiny Maschiff
WAIT HUH 24 HOURS HUHH HOW
the hidden shiny
i saw it when it spawned
12:48 am o going insane or is that a purple belibolt
The exact same thing happened to me with Varoom. I was looking up where to find Torkoal in that area, and a shiny one ran into me.
I fond the dog
shiny masciff i think
Hello,Merry Christmas I’ve just got Pokémon scarlet and the first 2hrs in I got a shiny Nackli that I named lucky  Full odds aswell 1/4096 B)
Your unsatisfying sandwich looked good to me!
Mabostiff
Just got scarlet violet double pack for X-mas
Vid 2 of trying to givr nokimon a shiny eternatus aka notice me and accept the shiny
Noki has to be one of the best Pokémon creators
I remember running past area 2 in the beach and ran into 2 shinies one was mareanie and a finizen and I wasn’t even looking for them
Pokémon evolving skies tcg set has a shiny Froslass card…
Thank you for the Christmas upload :D
Literally hacking how is he so lucky 😭
10:47 I wouldn’t have known that the masschiff was shiny if I didn’t own a shiny masschiff myself
everyone say thank you nokimon for the christmas gift :)! (and merry christmas too!)
13:44 Well, today I just trolled random players in showdown with pain split Toxapex named Medusa
The angel and the devil and pure whiye annialape would look awesome
Merry Christmas Noki and fans!!

I think I know what is part 3 gonna be like
I've found 15 shinies so far in Scarlet

10:14 Shiny Maschiff noticed it because unlike it's older evolution siblings it actually changes significantly in color from standard. Paused at 10:15 before answer
10:12 maschiff on left of the screen
Annailape shiny should have white to represent an angel because he looks like the devil
So next Ep Is area zero
BUSH MASCHIFF
this was awsome! i might do this challenge myself and i spotted it at 10:12 i wont tell what it was so other have a chance to spot it
Loving the FE ost you used in this episode :)
I’ve been waiting ;-; and Merry Christmas
I think Cazerola Lake and the forest north of it are from the North province, since they have the same music as the Glaseado Mountain... well, who cares.  Great video, great challenge, great golden ball Rellor.
There's a shiny drowsy next to the den in the Bush at 10:23 in the video
W christmas present ive been waiting like 2 weeks for this vid!
u missed mastiff
i saw it it was maschiff
Intro was awesome :)
I got violet today and found a shiny salandit on like the first one I saw it was female as well
Marry Christmas
Merry Christmas
i found a shiny steenee while adventuring and i haven’t even completed half the game 😭
Song 24:11?
Merry Christmas. And you gave me the courage to try and shiny hunt in the game again. So right after I play some animal crossing and charge my switch, I'll do that
haha once spent hours hunting mareanie, before i ended up taking a break - only to run into it as soon as the sandwich ended
Maschiff
I can’t remember its
You genuinely deserve so many More subs and views
Fact i have shiny wugtrio say why the diglett glitch as A PENNIS real
POV You look to the comments for the shiny.
Reminds me of when a shiny golduck just decided to drop by and fight me. I didn't know it was even there.
Premier bolas
I found it
Mischief

Great Christmas gift
HMMMMMM i love eating sandwichs without the top HMMMM delicious  Also MERRY CHRISTMAS and HOLYDAYS
A new series of shinys has begun
i love nokimon
Rune scape music 🙄
Its Christmas but it feels like a normal ahh day
My favourite shiny you’ve caught in this series is siclizar
Well this is an awesome christmas gift!!
ALL in one video? wow
Maschiff!
🐐 Goated Christmas vid 👍
I actually cought that shiny in the clips as well... mentally screaming at the screen "WAIT! GO BACK!!!" 😅
MERRY CHRISTMAS NOKI AND THANKS FOR THE CONTENT
6:59 how did you get this shot
found my first full odds while watching this, thanks for the luck lmao
Wait wouldn’t he just save before encountering it?
OMG the shiny mastiff prevo, forgot it's name, I found it's prevo while hunting a goomy so my eyes have been trained to spot it
Funny how Noki and MandJTV both had the primal instincts to instantly make the pun of "Lagtree Thicket"
your progress as a content creator is beautiful, the intro, the buildups, you became top tier my man
wow, would be nice to find A SHINY POKEMON, couldn't be me, merry Christmas
Damn this video is so well scripted and edited! I knew thought I would get this invested in shiny hunting.
There was a shiny oinklonge in the bush before mabostiff
I absolutely love shiny toedscruel, I have one in a dream ball and it matches so perfectky
Me shiny hunting for 50 hours getting 4 shinys 😢
noki you inspired me to hunt my own shinies!!!! I've caught 23 shinies so far :)
whats the song that plays after you say that youre gonna complete every area
My guy ran past a shiny mafia dog
hi
List of missed areas I can think of: inlet grotto, glacidea mountain pass, elite four area, all four Paldean seas.
8:30 I ran into my shiny toedscool the same exact way but it was the one in the tree
I got Scarlet today!
Same thing happened to me with rellor. I got an outbreak and on the way I found 2 shiny rellors
Machiff
I caught a shiny pyroar today. Merry Xmas
6:45 what song is this?
Crimis video😖
Merry Christmas!
Lagtree  thicket is what mandjtv calls it too! And i agree its lagtree thicket
10:21 mobosstiff was also shiny
Omg amazing Christmas, I'm so happy been litterally waiting for so long
Whenever I play scarlet I'm in eternal paranoia that I missed a shiny especially something i really like like brambleghast or larvesta
Bet for the area zero hes gonna catch every pokemon there is in shiny
200k before the end of the year
That's how I met my shiny broom too he just rammed me
I paused at 10:16 and saw the purple maschiff
Merry crimas
I’m not early.. BUT.. I’m at least not late
You don’t have to put the top buns for sandwiches so ruining them isn’t nesessary   I just saw the past that you said that you don’t need it lol
Amazing content from this channel! Cant wait to see what comes next!
There was a shiny foongus right before the  shiny maschiff
You know shiny scovillain is the first ever shiny I’ve gotten in all of my time playing Pokémon
This is the first video im watching with my new headphones! Anyways, I've been doing this challenge with you, so I'll update you on my progress! Poco Path: Hoppip South Area 1: Fletchling South Area 2: Smoliv South Area 3: Klawf South Area 4: Wooper, Starly, Skiddo South Area 5: Chewtle and Flamigo South Area 6: Fidough  West Area 1: 2 Rockruffs Asado Desert: Rellor West Area 2: Cyclizar West Area 3:Machstiff Casseroya Lake: Foratress  I've really enjoyed the challenge so far, but most of them have taken me at least 2 sandwiches, which is why you already did all 4 sections and I only finished the west. Also, I have multiple listed because I kept using the sandwich in 1 area until it was over instead of moving on. Merry Christmas, and good luck with your future shiny endeavors.
Man's underrated for 0 reason and idk why
Best Sv video i have seen in while, keep it up!
I just wanted to train evs with killing cyclizard and accidentally found a shiny one wtf, full odds btw, 5mins after i saw in the vid
Plllllllllllls  do ep 3
I love your vids! Been watching since BEFORE the master ball series ( not on this acc tho )
Next episode, if you think it's a shiny try to auto battle it. If it is, it won't kill it.
Aside from quick witted, cute humor and fantastic editing, the background music is one of my favorite things about your videos ♥
Ah yes, the nokimon christmas special
My first shiny was a shiny rellor I thought it was a normal pokemon!
Mashtif
10:12 shiny in maschief grup
Was i the only one that Saw the shiny drowzze
Hi I’m Drippy Tom
Nokimon merry xmas and i got a shiny frosslass and named it after you love your vids keep it up
3:50 Rellor was actually my first shiny of the game, from a raid no less
The dog was shiny sad miss
I’m so proud for seeing the Maschiff first try. No wonder I love shiny hunting😂
Christmas merry
Glad to be of service o7
Hi, and Merry Christmas!
Hey noki, if i were you i would check your shinies for marks. I did and i had like 5 with em.
Pro tip I found out hunting mimikyu. When you send your pokemon to auto battle, they won't want to fight Shinies, so if you suspect you found a hard to see shiny, you can send your pokemon to battle it, if they refuse to fight, it's a shiny. Or you can go on a killing spree until it stops fighting lol.
the maschiff in the corner
Man, you got lucky with your shiny Cyclizar. I actually found one yesterday, but I was battling a trainer when it showed up and by the time I was done it was gone T_T
In case I go back to Pokemon Scarlet/Violet one day, which Shiny Pokemon is the easiet to find in the South area at the beginning of the game (like, when you're going to beat the bug or grass Gym for your first badge)? I got lucky and found a Gulpin but I doubt I'll be that lucky ever again.
I love that Varoom encounter XD
10:21 you better be glad you found maschiff cause you missed a mabostiff
We just gonna a ignore the purple shiny at 10:22?
I Honestly Got Shocked When He Said "ALL OF THEM"
Really awesome!
Ahhh Christmas with my comfort zone youtuber uploading a video ❤️
It was shiny maschiff, I only knew it cause I caught one before lol
great way to start my christmas
shiny maschiff, left of screen at 10:12
For anyone who wants to do a shiny mimikyu hunt the best tip I can give is to look at the cheeks, Shiny Mimikyu Cheeks are gray and normal mimikyu cheeks are orange it’s what helped me on my hunt
So did i mienxiao
I may or may not have changed my hair like your character cause it’s looks so darn cool!
Rip shiny pup
i would assume rellor is rolling a nugget around
I ended up finding a random shiny scovillain during a hawlucha outbreak, and its shiny has really grown on me. I named him Wilbur after WIlbur Scoville, and he flexes his drip on everyone. Shiny scovillain supremacy?
Maschif
this is one of the best series on this channel
Amazing video! Can't wait for area zero!
The great crater should count as 2 areas
Finally the next episode!!
Quick tip for making sandwiches, if you place the bread at the bottom of the screen it’ll just disappear and you won’t have to worry about stuff falling of when you drop the bread
The shiny in the clip is the Maschiff?
Shiny pachirisu and also merry Christmas nokimon
i would love a shiny Pawmi!   i keep hunting and havent found one yet
Finally I’ve been waiting for 2 weeks for a new video, I wish these were daily but thats a little greedy of me lol
the effort you put in for out shiny hunting entertainment is unreal. We appreciate you blessing us this christmas
I have been waiting for this video finally also keep up the good work
is just me or he did not see a shiny numel at 3:10
Yes i was waiting for this video. Im also doing this because of you. I finished the south province in 9 hours. Now i can continue the hunts.
I got my first shiny today in scarlet, christmas also the day this video about shinies released
Watching nokimon on a train
Wow shiny catcher
Sneasel was my first shiny in Scarlet and Violet after 3 days of playing. Congrats on all the shinies!
It was the maschif on the left hand side
Your luck is absolutely disgusting man. I have been so unlucky in this game recently but at least I can see someone else’s shiny hunts succeed! Merry Christmas Noki!
Maschiff
LOVE U NOKI
the reveal of this being all the rest of the provinces was so fucking hype
You skipped a couple areas but good video.
Found kinda mid shinys ngl expected cooler ones you got half already on arcus
I spotted the maschif
I'll never shiny hunt another shiny Mimikyu, I am loyal to one and one only. my first ever actual shiny hunt was Mimikyu in sun and moon sos chaining. could never "replace" her while waiting for home compatibility
15:21 you called a taxi G
This is so fun to watch man, keep up good content Noki
It was maschif
Getting scarlet and violet for christmas❌️ Nokimon upload✅️
Shiny vroom was on a mission to free his brothers in christ
I saw a shiny Maschiff on the left
Mankey was my first shiny in violet :)
16:32 second person who calls it lagtree thicket that ive heard.
gotta rep those gen 7 shinies!!! they are all some of my favs too. happy holidays, have a great day noki love your content as always!!
Could you just replace a rellors ball with gold and make it shiny
omg guys he has a master ball HE CANT FORGET IT ANYMORE :D
I saw the blue doggo, I just saw a lot of red and Al line sudden, boom, blue

Happy holidays
Merry Christmas
HAPPY HOLIDAYS EVERYONE!!! hope your day is going great!

15:20 wow, that Pokémon heard that you were shiny hunting, and rushed over to you

Wow thanks for the awesome Christmas present, Nokimon!
You miss a shiny powmi
HALP Halloween
This is my goat
I found the shiny maschiff yey :D
Thank you for uploading today, I was kinda sad this christmas and this kept me well entertained 💜   Also someone else that gets attacked by shinies!!
Ok I got to say I love these vids but truly you should shiny hunt in like pokemon diamond or pearl and see how hard that is it is not like I am a shiny hunter but I KNOW you will have such a amazing time ok lol it's just a joke merry xmas can't wait for the next video
ALL OF THEM!!!
Maschiff
Merry Christmas Noki!
I just watched ur previous vid a week ago, after watching it i instantly got two shinies in a minute without any boost after opening the game. So thx for the luck.
i love the effort nokimon puts in his vids. definitely my favorite poketuber by far
I screwed up hard with Rellor. The first few times I used shiny boosting sandwiches, I managed to get at least 3 shinnies per run, so I started over estimating how potent they were (or underestimating my bad luck), so when I used a sandwich and managed to ONLY get a Rellow, I thought, "Oh, I should reset and try again so I get a few other shinnies along side Rellow". Well, I've yet to run into a shiny Rellor since then.
it’s 1:30 and i was about to sleep until this king released a vid🔥
It was worth waiting!!!
okay so i heard when you play for hours ur game event begins to bug out so when it does ur just supposed to close out if the game and turn it back on
BEFORE 1 HOUR WOOHOO, I loved the first part and am so happy that this new one is out!
merry christmas noki you probably won’t see this comment but i pray you have a wonderful day
I was waiting for the vid and I said it’s been a while prob might have spent a week for a single shiny
The sequel is here!
You might be my favourite poketuber but please release more videos it will be better i promise ( btw not complaining
Found a shiny swablu full odds while watching😂
i got a shiny gogoat by acciddent as well
When you caught the steenie you said it’s going on the competitive team. Are you going to make competitive videos?
I have been waiting forever
Maschiff
It's the dog. The dog is sparkly!
the last shinny you caght was the first shinny i caught
You should do all the ocean areas
I was hunting a shiny dreepy when a cyclizar randomly ran into me and I panicked and killed it by accident :|.
hi
Happy holidays nokimon🎉
Shiny maschiff?
I didn't miss that RuneScape damage noise you snuck in there with the Cyclizar. Nice touch and it was appreciated!
Ive only watch episode 1, 3 times
Upset you didn’t hunt for cetoddle tho.
Your not lucky the shiny rates are like a 1 in 10 there so boosted its boring
The king is back 🎉
U missed a shiny  drowsy in west province area three before u caught the maschiff
YESSS THNAK YOU BRO IVE BEEN CHECKING YOUR CHANNEL FOR A NEW AREA LOCK EVERY DAY THANK YOU 😭😭
Subscribed
I dont like play pokemon games anymore, but you make it fun, thanks tho
I always call shiny Mankey the "Mint Monkey"
YESSS IVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG FOR THIS VIDEO
That varoom lul
Hi will you ever do a living shiny dex would watch it even if it is a our long.🤔🤔
WOW, when Noki found shiny mimikyu, i found one myself, what a coincidence.
Thank you Noki for blessing my screen on Christmas
10:15 nahhhh that’s a shiny rokidee if I ever saw one
I love your videos
Idgaf if its christmas Nokimon uploaded
Merry Christmas, Noki! I look forward to all your future videos - love them! :)
yes
I like this series a lot and I am so excited for episode three
Christmas vid yay (best Christmas gift ever)
I SPOTTED THE MASCHIFF POGGGG
This is honestly the best Christmas ever xD  Got so much stuff this year AND a Nokimon vid? Omg yes
Oml finally make part 3 faster also gl I give u my shiny luck
YEAH HEW UPLOADED
Your vids like these actually make me want to try out the challenge myself, cause I feel like we both have the same shiny odds when it comes to RNG lmao I also stumble upon the most random shinies and sometimes end up spending days on one I want  Happy Holidays!
New nokimon video YIPPEE!!!!!
YOOOOOO!!!!
Welcome to the Gogoat enjoyer club
wasn't the mabosstiff at the very start of the clip also shiny? thanks for sharing this challenge, it definitely makes me want to do it as well!
This series is goated
Dehavu 19:19
I am loving these videos. Currently working on getting the shiny charm in scarlet game and already had a few shinies run into me. I got attacked by an angry yellow balloon and a shiny goat. Also my guess for the 10 second shiny challenge clip would be maschiff or mabosstiff giving how dark the area was.
With varoom, you don't hunt it, it hunts you!
Bro has more shinnies Then I’ve caught Pokémon
I got 2 shiny's in erea zero in 2 minutes without a shiny charm
Shiny Varoom was on a mission: In Paldea, Shiny Pokémon hunt YOU.
The shiny hunted you
I had a similar experience to the mimikyu, I was hatching Sprigatito eggs and I said to myself "see the lighting in this game really messed with you, like that looks shiny"  And then it sparkled
The intro slaps!! Got so hyped
So badly thought that cyclizar was gonna get away with that tone tone of voice You we’re using. It sounded so sarcastic
Happy holidays!
Merry Christmas! I definitely wasn't expecting all 3 other main areas in one vid
I NEED to try this!
That varoom went FWOOOOOOOOSH 😂
12:05  thats not a bug the sandwich is just magnetic
Varrom is Hunt you
I love your content. Keep it up 👍
I may be wrong, but wasn't the mabosstiff at the beginning of the 10 second clip shiny as well?
A shiny makey was my fist shiny in this game so i caught it, not even 30 minutes later a shiny gible appeared. My team was under leveled so it killed my team and i lost it :(
Me and my Friend chose a Provinz and if  we found an entire a shiny team we fight against each other, but all Pokémon must be lvl 50 before the fight. Love your vids
I've been hunting storymode latias in alpha sapphire for 3 weeks now and watching your videos really help keep me going. Hoping to get it soon
Merry Christmas and a happy new year guys.:)
I love this series, keep up the great work ❤❤❤
At 10:12 there is shiny maschiff.  Edit: I was correct
hi
I caught a hundo snover and evolved it to a froslass and named it noki
This is my favorite Christmas gift
Merry christmas
I love your narration, merry Christmas!
This is the best Christmas gift! A Nokimon video!😊
I actually did see the shiny maschiff

4:55 I'm also hunting that one (but with shiny sandwiches
Love your shiny videos and happy holidays
I got a full odds shiny Mankey about 5 hours into my scarlet playthrough and a shiny wugtrio
Merry Christmas Noki!! Your videos make me so happy 😊.  I also love this series
Nokimons video is the greatest christmas gift.
I found two shiny in my violet game in under 10 mins back to back not lying
Your luck is insane, this is probably fake
Shiny Maschiff in the horde
that shiny steenee spawned in the exact same place for me
Shiny locked is dope! Thank you for this.
Found a shiny Glalie earlier thanks to a outbreak of them thankfully the eyes gave it away and found a shiny Rookiedee thanks to a terra Jigglypuff thought the Rookiedee looked funny coz of the lights of the terra then realised it was shiny
I'd like to share that I started my playthrough recently, and found two full odds shinies within the first two days
I saw the Maschiff, I don’t get how your didn’t. Fair play to Blue for having your back!
the shiny was mabostiff!
YES i've been waiting for the second part for 2 weeks i finally can watch the second part thank you for the video Nokimon
Best Christmas gift is a new vid from Nokimon!
counting the days till part 3 🔥🔥🔥🔥
