Immigrants

Police a gangs themselves, gangs with badges and guns 😂😂😂😂
This sounds like NY during the Al Capone era
The NY citizens are getting what they asked for when they boted the Dems in. This is only the beginning of the crimes to come from the criminals Joe let into our country.
usual suspects
The level of brainwashing has to be at North Korea levels. We all know NYers will elect democrats again and it will not be close.
Vote for trump 2024 November election so trump can deport all the migrants gangs out ours country
Innocent victums🤔 No really!😁 Amazing!!
Dominicanos.
Lot of sub-humans there.

Venezuelans for sure
Bet work for joe biden😅😅
The hood clan
Lock all their asses up please!!!
I know you'll can't say why this happens, but I know why; drugs is just a symptom of bigger problems; it's not hard, it's so easy to understand; if you'll could find out what the murderous black boys have in common, you'll know the answer; but you'll can't investigate this because if you do, your career is over and you might get shot in the back; wayward crazy ignorant black mothers selling her own children, fathers & communities down the drain for a pass-through check; family courts are the very emissary of death, they're sadistic sociopaths with utter contempt for life; no one's safe cause of their demonic works; they are mentally ill, you're all in on it through complacency; blacks & whites are destroying Americs; don't take my word for it, go to any family courts in any major city 8:15 am and see all the black people there waiting their turn to be annihilated: no doubt the black women's crazed children will kill one of you next
Oye platano dime tigre oye loco platanito 😅😅
NyC has no cash bail. They were all out within a few hours.  They promised to come to court though....😅
A train stops there
Usually these criminals all got the same boring nike tech style but that Prada shirt fire!
I think the police involved in a drug scheme 😅😂🤣😝😛😋😜🤪
Stupid neighbors
DA dismissed all charges

Great job officers. Now deal with the rest of the iceberg after taking care of the tip.
Alvin bragg will let them go

That money will help REfund the police once again!
Good work to the good officers who brought the gang down!
BLM
Death sentence for drug traffickers. Death sentence for violent gang members. Violent criminals should never have any rights only the law-abiding should have rights.
Black rap music, and black culture is the worst out of all races
Thank you police 🚨 officers. Keep these hoodlums off the streets forever 😐
Lock all these animals up. Take them all out.
Love that they're all in prison now, bunch of cxxts
DONT BELIVE EVERYTHING YOU SEE AND HEAR SOME NEWS MAY BE FAKE
Fake news, the majority of this people are taken to court to be witness. It happened to me while coming from work, without knowing what is going on, the nypd knock on my door and took me without telling me anything, and me and my sister hard working people just living in that area  for couple of months not even knowing our neighbors. Also a whole bunch of people they took to court came from vacation so they didn’t know anything either. Please stop taking hostage unnecessary people to make false news.
THEY OWN RESTAURANTS, STORES,BARBER SHOPS,BODEGAS, MUSIC STUDIO ,PAWN SHOPS, PIZZERÍA
Deport them all... they want to come to America to escape the crime but instead comes here only to do the crime stupid
Come get the 1457 lobby young kids selling drugs and no tenant say anything
😮All Hispanic that’s why trump say what he states 😮
This is a generational issue.
There it is folks. This, is where these teens are learning it from. The home. The family unit in the U.S. is destroyed.
They Come Here Already as Gang Members, and These Landlords are Renting Storefronts and Apartments throughout the Tristate Area.  Now You Have Low Income Immigrants Driving G Wagons. How?
as long as mexico is next to america gangs and drugs will never stop so good luck
They gotta make money somehow.
Without targeting and taking down the correct gangs, this so called take down will not make a dent on crime in the city. The gangs that needs to be taken out are the democratic legislators in the NYC council, and Senators in Albany, including the governor.
Good job.
1 year later u guys really solved the problems😂. Take 20 off the street 20 more are in their place right after the patty wagon drives away. Make drugs legal and this all stops. But nope to much $ for politicians
Look at these Dominicans you let them in the country and this is what they do
THANK YOU NYPD FOR GETTING THESE SAVAGES!  But they should conceal the identity of these officers!
Dam domi's.
Get the drugs off the streets and crime goes down.
Drugs

Jail and deported

Congratulations for the good work 👏
I said News Media is Always Very Late to the Party, But Wait Till they Find Our How Deep this Dominican Gang Thang Go. I Suspect there's Dominican Gang members in the Police Department.
Execute them today!!!
You are jealous of these KILLING BECAUSE YOU police-sheriff WANT to KILL ALL THE WRONGFUL KILLING
this is a good way to make your parents proud
We need to bring back public executions for these people
The media needs to start calling out certain demographic communities that not only can identify these domestic terrorists but virulently protect them.....way too many useless bad apples amongst them. Shame on them! 😆
Mayor Adams says  your be out by nightfall
All of these 'ANGELS' are already out, the  Police just brought them in for a photo, then the DA ordered them FREE.
Chris cross make u jump
DEFUND those single baby momas
Bet they won't go bust the Latin Kings.   They own the police .government in NYC.  Pick the little thugs with a gang name. 🤣🤣🤣🤣😍
Lock em up !!!!
3buK
They all Spanish lol no black people ✊🏾
But diversity surely s the most wonderful thing that ever happened to NYC.
Tearing up our own communities  Glad they locked them up I was born & raised in a very bad part of NY by a single mother & still never wanted or felt like I needed to sell drugs or bust a gun.
We NEED to bring back public hangings
Who they beefing with
May u continue to arrest gang bangers gang members robbers murderers and drug dealers.
unfortunately residents are not allowed to arm themselves or take physical action to defend without fear of recourse by the District Attorney. The police can't be everywhere.
These criminals are just dumb. Bring back the mafia. Get control again.
Good job 👏 👍
They were Released  by DINNER
16 arrested all let go with a fine and a good slap on the rist.
The district attorney will let them bond out on their signature and include met tickets and a few free coupons for Dunkin' donuts coffee! Way to go district attorney office!
Takedowns occur "....more and more frequently..." Really? More than four years and dozens of DTs for relatively low-hanging fruit?
Hope a judge orders them all held without bond until trial. If not, then what’s the point?
Broadway bullies Own Every Dollar 🧐 those Trinidadian MFS bout that life 🧐
About got damn time.they get these low life's off the street
Gang members need to be done and gone from this earth.
Just another left wing city 😒
Put em UNDER the jail
Are they all brown?
Why can't these people seek out a good honest living? My conscience wouldn't let me. I feel terrible when I'm late for work. Can't imagine being in a whole criminal gang.
There is a dangerous gang doing harm to innocent people in Lydig ave and Wallace ave and Holland ave one of them is called Eddie Miranda and his brother Freddie Miranda they tried to rape their own nephew 8 or 9 years old Xavier and they are both walking free looking for other easy victims  I do not trust nypd at all any more I believe there is corruption there especially 49 precint
Hey we need this done in K.C. Mo Parsons doesn't do anything  for Missouri. Take the gangs down and the meth. If you can't solve the murders from these gangs then take the gangs out were sick of it. We need people sitting in our seats that are willing to do Thier jobs! Vote Democrat!
Lol impossible it will always continue as long as their is no equality. Racism drugs no jobs high rents will cause these criminals to keep working the street and pigs don't help
It's sad to see so many females getting involved in gangs,drugs,violence and crime.
Dam took mom gmas An fathers an kids no way to to connect to the outside world now An the gun man took one of them in the car after shooting him dam he must of really wanted him
Good job my brothers and sisters. Stay Safe 👮🏻‍♂️🙏🏻💙🚔🚨
Great job!!
Wow yea thank you officers great job…🙏🙏🙏
🤣🤣🤣 please deport this garbage.
The United States allowed gang members to extend their territory in order for them to have works to do. The Fed and the CIA can help pin points where all gang members are hiding and operated. The police alone cannot do the jobs. They need the public corporation as well as assistance from the Fed and the CIA.
They have been doing this shid since the 1960s..Its never going to stop.Forget it.
These,or,grown,mens
The FIVE CRIMINAl FAMILIES in Washington DC (Biden, Pelosi, Schumer Carry and Clinton), should be arrested too.
"Innocent victims". I didn't know there are guilty victims.
This is not just a low income issue. Don Jr too is a drug addict. But no one is looking for his dealer. Just saying.
Call ICE ASAP.
Maybe they should keep them in jail for a change.
Shot them dead...cancer in society
I thought we defunded those NYPD thugs?? You're telling me they're still running amok out there persecuting good citizens??
Good job
lmao at the cop wearing the fallen shirt
Just do me a favor and keep them off our streets and our neighborhoods.
👏👏👏👏👏
to the young youth it's not worth it, you think it's all fun and games until tragedy happens think twice before doing something that you'll regret your life is worth more than this..
Go NYPD New York's finest.
Animals
This ain't nothing compared to what's going to be happening with Bidens love for illegal aliens  and open border. Thanks poopy pants for making our country so safe. FJB
Their actions show the contents of their characters..... Dr. King is so disgusted and disappointed right now over his people
This is so beautiful to watch. Clowns
Amen. Back to hell demons.
Great job NYPD and I'm sick of the violence 💯💯💯💯👍
These jackasses made enough money to all go their separate ways and start a new life with a fat bank account in a new town or city and escape the gang life
bring the electric chair back..wake up usa..get rid of anti american gangs..go cops..respect the police
NYC HAS KNOW THIS FOR A WHILE AND YEARS...YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM YOU HAVE A GANG MENTALITY...
Wow, I rarely say this , but good work. NYC needs to be cleaned up.
Mostly immigrants.
This is why you Don't take money from the police if anything give them more funds so they can do there jobs !!!
Broadway bullies lol. They got caught because they walked instead of dancing away!!
All black , we have a blakc culture problem
They will be released in a few hours.. They are protected by NYC DA, by their skin color, by BLM...
Good job officers get these cowards off the streets
Send some hashtags . . . where's BLM's statements on this stuff?
My mammie never told me Ize was gonna goes to prisons
they are so stupid thinkin' that the police don't know everything about; played/chosed wrong side of the game: a loser one

How about if you see more than 2 joggers together you can just open fire? Very good chance one of the two or even both are fucking criminals anyway...
Smh not impressed  , two police died and now it's an issue iam board 😑
They make it sound so easy to just go to work.  Let's all do it the "América" way.
So just being in a gang is illegal? Even if you don't break any laws?
New York so disgusting State all you arms robbery violence murder gangster. Fucking defund the governor and the mayor.
Love those Covid justice supporting crime.
That little bit of money and drugs... Laughing My Fucking Ass Off. Two guns and some shitty clothes/purses. My goodness this is what my tax dollars are going towards. The money machine was the best thing I've seen.
A gang that has grandfathers, fathers and sons, daughters all a part of the game. That shows you the generational decay! crime is taught and pass down 3 generations
This is just for show.... publicity, total BS... because all "arrested" will be quickly released, NYC is a JOKE! 🤣
I’m ashamed of my home in New York City shame
What the detective advise destroit that drug .or the detective put that drug back in the street .i never see in united state the detective advise destroit the drug . Were the drug go.
We do not.need criminals in the street.👀.
Very nice keeping behind bars for life.🤔.
That pendant ain't 200k lol
It's ok they back on the streets already thanx to d.a. and lefty judges
See people don’t know they so stupid I was in the federal system… The government is built 200 prison for all gang member. They let all the gang do what you want right now, you really think they don’t know what the gang be doing they know everything they just trying to build a legal case, when they finish built all these prison they’ll come get all the gang member do you wanna lock everybody up, but the worst part is jail was going to be on lockdown it’s not going to be the same anymore… that’s why I’m trying to tell people leave the gang alone because when you hang around a gang member they all follow all the gang right now and if you hang around them when they do the RICO you going to get locked up too…They building a lot of prison right now for a gang member
Hopefully New York’s DA isn’t a softy
Heat it up! No judges no tribunal get rid of it all. No wasted taxpayer dollars on this kind of mess anymore.
✊🏿Black Lives Matter✊🏽 all black people are innocent.

PIX 11 News,     This isn't a surprise at all people with Set Agendas Extreme Left or Right are On A Mission To Have It  Their Way. Everything you see is Payback For Past Transgressions  Your Fault or Not. SAD!                                                 RCJ/LEO

Just shoot them.
This what need to happen to the bridge Port gang in connecticut covering up the lauren shields investigation...
What a hero’s they parents must be proud of  whom they raised!!!  Well the problem is they don’t know who their parents r. Being thug/ criminal is in their dna 🧬 which can’t be erased. Shame on DA by protecting these thugs and not taking any serious actions
Are these the same cowards tht MURDERED JUNIOR IN 2018?? it's about time tht these chumps are finally being dealt with we have no room for these types of cowards In our society.
Good 👍 job 👏 👍 👌 🙌 💪

I bet all of them are illegal citizens
Brig back the death penalty
👏🏾👏🏾😂👏🏾👏🏾
NICE POLICE WORK!! 💙🙏🏻🇺🇸
I bet their friends will mention saying” free the homie, he ain’t do nothing”.
This gang is about as equal as the NYPD
I'm sure they're all out on bail
Chicago take notes
Some of the cops dress like gang members themselves lol
🥂 Good job
Just execute all them…
Faces of criminals, support the blue, support law and order.
Enjoy prison
Good to see parasites off the streets
I'm not the least bit impressed by this political campaign. Cops love to engage in these crackdowns when the cameras are rolling and their targets are black or brown.  But when it comes to the Mafia and other organized criminals who import the drugs, guns, and other contraband into the ghettos the cops and news media all disappear.  Try lifting a gun to a Mafiosi and you will have a bullet in your head.  Anyone else try it and you'll be swimming in a lake tied down to your car.  What's going to happen here is that organized criminals will now hire another set of street gangs to sell their drugs and make massive profits off of that activity.  Street gangs are only a symptom of the problem, not an actual cause.  The real problem is organized crime that takes place in the suburbs and which brings drugs in from overseas with the blessings of the corrupt cops and politicians who are on the take.
This is the weakest generation ever stop looking at me bro 😂🤣😂🤣
500 black ppl have to get arrested to make up for the 500 white ppl that got away with attacking the capitol!
Prison is not a punishment for these guys .they are protected and get rank when they go to jail...swift execution and chopping off hands will send a message
Serious police work   We need this in all Projects city wide
Free my Trimis, I'm not Dominican, but still free my niggas. Also shout out to the dark skin indigenous looking Dominican mommies, I SEE YOU
Glad these criminals are off the streets but one of their crimes was money laundering . All the biggest banks have been caught money laundering. Wachovia bank for example laundered $380 Billion dollars for a drug cartel and received a 160 million dollar fine . No one went to jail and they are still in business. That small fine is just a business expense when you are raking in  Hundreds of Billions of dollars .
Start building a new Rykers Isl. Put it out to sea.
They are ready to bang on each other and have no mercy killing each other "So" When the Beast Bang at your door you should be ready to go 2 War.....  Naw you rather be lead out in handcuffs like you had enough.....We are not ment to survive because it's A set up....Tupac changes
all blm pride
Nice !!
Thank you thank you thank you
Good Job..lock up all those who are destroying the community.
If Judges and the prosecuters office refuse to do they job, we the the people will come and burn their houses down!
So why are they going out and shooting people?  Why why why?
Ephesians 5:15–16 in the King James Version says, “See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil.”
My heart goes out to the police n  the dangerous job they do. As bad as COVID has been in  NY, why aren’t these people wearing masks???
Hopefully all the other cities in the country is following their lead.👍🏾
Deported them back to there country and there families
the babe in pink💕
Hell yeah, throw all these scumbags in jail. Lock em up for good
This is old. YouTube is recycling stories
get rid of stop and frisk ......u got what u deserved 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Good work. Any way to deal with the legal gangs that sell drugs to unsuspecting patients who can't afford the drugs and who aren't aware of all the side-effects?
RIP to Junior (young man killed by the psychos).  But this takedown will not stop the poor from doing stupid, violent things in street gangs.    The real problem is, everywhere in the world where there is poverty, there are street gangs.  People self-medicate cause they can't afford medical drugs, the drugs have side effects or they don't like the need for prescriptions, etc.   Poverty and racism are the real problems.   Humanity must do an honest assessment of these issues and not just quick fixes. The biggest gangs don't get arrested and aren't living in the hood. They're the ones these low-level black and latino gangs work for.
If you want to fix the city get DiBlasio out of office!!!!!!!!!!
Looks like the DiBlasio has a 20 fuc--- that city up!
Maybe Giuliana needs to come out of retirement and fix the city back to the way it was
My hat is off to you men and women  for your great efforts to control sin. Sir Lucifer The Great, I sell people's ass not Crack. Slave trader. Well not that Crack. Pay your taxes. Money laundromats are a thing of the past.
Bravo no mercy but these district attorneys are the scumbags who let them walk with no recourse nyc is turning into 1970 era and it isn’t cute. Social justice? Or now a way to not hold certain ppl responsible?
It’s hard to correct what you have done. You know who you are.
Time to shut down the dope dealers.
Take the gang members kidney I need one I am not a member..
Great job officer 👍👌☺️
Broadway Bullies lmfao what
To mini white 👮‍♀️ for me
Free dem 😜
Arrested the entire family
Well now very interesting seeing how the nypd just this November that past put out a crime statistics being 17% lower from 2020 and yes some of can read and  analyze the bull crap and also thank goodness they weren’t FBA.
Good riddance 👏
Good job NYPD
Why bother it's all the sham these people will be out in an hour claiming racial Justice ⚖️ no one will dare speak up against them because these people will be out in a matter of hours to make sure snitches get stitches
Must eliminate that shirt that cover these criminals
Now cops wanna do they job ...
Fly them back to DR. Drop them over the ocean!
Come to Simpson street in the Bronx. There is more
We need the real criminals behind bars .
good work! so much more to do though to get all of these criminals off of our streets
You want find the criminals following the money. The police is just arresting foot Soldiers.
They take them guns and drugs off the streets then put em back in the hands of other criminals
Great job bro's in blue!!!!!!! No disrespect intended, but for tactical reasons (to ensure our brothers get to their EOT's in one piece) KEEP THE MEDIA OUT OF WHAT WE DO!!!!!!!!!!! SH*THEADS WATCH TV TOO!!!!!!!!!!
Bad enough to be involved in a crime to begin with.  It's worse to be involved in a criminal conspiracy with co-defendant(s) who could testify against you in exchange for a plea deal...and worst of all to involve yourself in a criminal conspiracy with a woman.  Women aren't held to the same standards as men when it comes to snitching...especially if they have children who they'll be separated from if they're sent to prison (she'll happily snitch on everyone, including you, in order for her to get her back to her children sooner).
Good give them a long jail sentence garbage off the streets
It took the police 3 yrs to get a fuckin gang off the streets of nyc???bullshit
Please let’s make a city safe For are children’s please keep those Coward! Far away . Please protect the NYPD Amen! PS protect our children!👍🏼
If caught, you should LOOSE YOUR HEAD.By way of chopping block and SWORD 🗡
Thank you for your service honest clean police work is what we need please keep it coming God Bless you all. I have 9 grandchildren counting on you all.
GUESS SHOULD HAVE STAYED ON OTHER SIDE OF BORDER
So they go to jail waste more taxpayers money. When are we going to execute gang members...
Omg that’s one  dam gang in nyc 8.8 million people you know how many different dealers there are they got some tiny ass little gang I’d be embarrassed to put this on the news … I rather keep it on the low and plow through the city ridiculous
Broadway Bullies 😂😂😂😂😂
Nothing will change unless we end poverty. Law enforcement is useless
(Joedy 👼🦁☀️) 😠 Free my boii pookie ….  (Gabby 👼🐉🔥) 🤨 Who’s pookie?   (Joedy👼🦁☀️) Idk 🤷🏻 , I always wanted to say that 😅

His momma got arrested. LOLOLOLOLOLZ Dear Momma!
Donald Trump. Where are you buddy? Help us.
Unfortunately many court judges will  let them back out in the streets. PREDICTION: The future world dictator the anti-christ will get rid of all gangs and gangsters permanently, because he want everyone to have Allegiance to him, or work for him.
Let those people have their day in court I am not going to be the first to judge though especially just hearing the police side
And a whole bunch of muthufockers
Lol 😆 🤣 😂 😹  gang 🤣
The gang members watching this at home on their TV like: 👁👄👁
I wish EVERY gang member was taken in to custody - permanently.
It always comes to an END
What are the colors or the criminals
What AOC and her crew and kamala have to say about this
So they can do police work
Fathers wife’s and sons all in it. That’s why they never move up in life.
WE NEED THEM AT THE BORDERS

Oh as usual all good citizens wrongfully accused ya right thank goodness for bail reform !
TAKE ALL THEM IN.THIS CANNOT BE HAPPENING.PEOPLE LIFE TAKING AWAY LIKE JUNIOR PUT THEM AWAY.
I’m a black man I support law enforcement, all is not bad,  I don’t support defunding police,  I actually support increased wages, their is always a bad apple in every bunch and they should be held accountable, but most are not. Thanks for your service from a black American 🇺🇸 citizen.
It sickens me knowing all these guys are Dominican...as a native New York City Dominican I want something more positive from my culture

Really New York cracking down on gangs - must be de Blasio didn't get his memo on there are no criminals.
👎🏾
living large would get you caught.  but hey, you wouldn't see a cop arresting another cop for criminal activity they commit.  that would be news
democrats voters for sure
they will go back out. remenber who is the vice president now!!
Isn't it funny that Harlem is the Epicenter for Bill Clinton..that's his hangout since leaving the White House..does anyone remember that was Bill Clinton's choice to call home.. probably to continue him and his brother's Cocoaine enterprise he ran during his Presidency
They'll be back home soon. Its America
As long as none of the criminals were hurt. Now get them back out asap!
GET RID OF THESE PEOPLE NOW..
Please keep them locked away🙏
Great! Now execute them by firing squad in the middle of Harlem.
Congrats to the police department
A bounce of dam asses throwing thier lives aways for nothing
Lol they all was released within hours and the rest was the next day.Run the news story on that!!!!!
So fuck bodycams?
That's a really poor crew. Looks like that designer bag and medallion is shared by all of them🤣
Inter generational gangs!  I cannot fathom growing up in a family like that!  There’s only 2 places you’ll end up!  Prison or a cemetery.  We’ll never be able to stop it if mothers, fathers, and grandparents run the show!
LOCK UM UP! LOCK THEM ALL UP....GOD DAMMIT!!!

The reporter Nicole Johnson, I love her voice and speech pattern
Innocent criminals being arrested by Gangland Cops.
Hopefully the get fully prosecuted and sentenced accordingly. No BS low bail like AOC crys about just because they are black and brown.
God hates NYC
Police try to take down suppermarcists in NY
When the leaders are  corrupt and not held accountable. What make anyone believe their understudies would be different?
look at the first cop do they not pay them anymore that he has to wear ripped and dirty clothes sticking. wow how much money was spent for 3 years of this shit going on and how many people were killed cuz the cops let this go on for so long I hope that if anyone lost a love over these 3 years they need to sue the police for letting there loved be killed well letting it go on for 3 year s sickinhg
Bull shit
Give them the death penalty!
The deblassio  free ride crime spree os over .
This has been going on for 100  years there. Why is this news station acting like it’s something new.
The Blue gang doesn't like competition
The gang is so sophisticated that they don't have anyone watching for 12?  Lol.... Maybe they so sophisticated and big that they don't need to...lol
You take one out, there will be 100 to replace them. They bust the drug dealers but how about the dirty cops they have around the city.
They'll post a hundred dollar bail and be back out in an hour
We have to as a Nation "REPENT! and turn to the Law of YAH (God). Unless repentance start in the House of God, we shall continue in violence on a swift pace to destruction.
Come to dyckman……

75 years minimum for each member. 125 years minimum for the shooter.
Parents?!! These people should never be able to breed.
Meanwhile the ABI has grown from a gang to a mafia cause the white cops keep letting them grow without going after them and buying political power in the city to take down their competition. Great job NYC.

Feds in 4 🙌
Good job Officers!!!

Taking down entertainers rap artist etc who work in cohesive with them get all of them lawlessness will not be tolerated violence against Americans and innocent people will not be tolerated
May God bless and protect all police officers. Romans 13
Well done law enforcement

Take them all out! I could care less. They don't respect other people's lives.
Police gangs ...who relentlessly works to put them away?
This is nypd? Yeah best police force in the US. They should do outreach to other police forces to teach them what to do about gangs and thugs.
Good. Lock em up.
Gangs are just as  bad as al-Qaeda!
Dominicans...probably cannot even speak English.
lies
It is a good feeling when people can live in a safe neighborhood

Police always do great work, up to the courts to throw away the key. They need the gas chamber, not a sentence.
Thank God for the good guys cleaning up the scum of the Streets. Keep up the great work. Support the Blue.

Can you make a chart of the gangs and send it to me?
I hope this saves innocent people from senseless violence

NYPD still the dirtiest gang in NY
Too bad New York 🗽 doesn’t allow its law abiding citizens to lawfully carry guns. Because they could fight back and take out these gangs.
You know all the females in that crew finna drop the ball🤣🤣🤣
They were stupid you live in NYC the biggest police state in the in United States in every one of their police shows someone end up snitching 😂
So after the felons get out of prison, are they going to cancel their welfare and food stamps?

Thank God they got them 🙏
Stupid is as stupid does.
You have to make prison hard on these gangs. Separate them and crush all gangs in the prisons…brutally if you have to!!!
STARE'S also mean social media  musical STREET BEEFING as well. Which is just  a plain " DUMB-ASS" way to LIVE ONES LIFE .
The cops are a gang too..
The police don't like competition , They want to be the only gang standing.
Get rid of those parasites ! & good job NYC PD
That's That...kill people. Steal...and destroy family's....they sure were working for the Devil....see the Devil never wins only God... So we don't do what we want . .cause God will drop you on your face.   Bola!!!!!
exclusive:  No real suppliers in custody.  nobody from the docks where drugs come into the country..  nobody from the gun manufacturers.  this is called "hustling backwards"

Gangs are just small governments. No moral right or wrong that doesn't involve self promotion.
Gangsters will use mayor worlds as a message to them, he brought all this violence and crimes into us 🤔dirtiest democrats who only care about moneys.
There is more out there they’re just playing this so innocent we will catch you and trust me we will so you try to high
New york is the snitch and unloyal headquarters. It ain't easy to prosper
I said a hundred times you ain't gangsta into you shoot at the people who going to put you in jail you're not going to shoot at the police FBI CIA and all the other alphabet boys

Horrible la cadena de muertos que trae la cocaina desde que la cultivan producen transportan venden y consumen eso es muerte tras muerte. Eso es del demonio que les ofrece el dinero aparentemente facil y detras esta es la muerte
Grown ass people in a gang.  Smh
They should enforce martial law on this country bring in the tanks and helicopters and go to work.
NYPD doesn’t even know that they have these type of gang members within their own ranks 😂
Broadway bullies gang huh sounds like part of the boondocks...They must be the type of gang when in numbers get all bad ...
That pendent ain’t worth 200,000, it’s worth around 50,000-70,000USD
Go to the bronx westchester Avenue  with this type of activity specifically goes down on a day-to-day basis inside the inner blocks elder, Stratford , Wheeler Watson, Boynton Lawrence Morrison Westchester strip under the train station and I don’t give a fuck what happens to me but the truth needs to be told .  Also the 43rd is a corrupt pct detectives and high-ranking officers know exactly what’s going on. And do nothing about it which leads me to believe the key members are involved  It’s time to end the cycle oppression !!!
The cops are a gang of thugs too??
Na the moms got it 😂
Lock these c**ts  up
These white supremacist are out of control. Too much jogging
No one getting deported so it don't make no sense to arrest them they be in jail 5 to 10 yrs back on the block doing same crap. I didn't like Trump but he had a good policy enough is enough time to let domestic and foreign criminals who live in America to know if u here to do bullshit we sending you back home those born here like blacks and white life time imprisonment but it will never happen in this America
Those young thugs need to go to a Central american latino prison, then they will know what havoc is.
Good police job
To the cartel take a close look at the police officers faces... just remember how they look
Give them all life n prison
COME ON MAN aint one women under 220 lbs coming out of there the government cheese program is alive and kicking

Take this biden supporters out of the street.
They should be confined into a Dungeon located underground.
Thank you NYPD
jail time? DEPORTATION for legal or ILLEGAL immigrants? U.S CITIZENSHIP obtain by Legal immigrants REMOVED? . jail time is a joke  Judicial System is a joke  murders or attempted murders they getting DEATH PENALTY? NOPE juat jail at most DEPORTATION
Crime is everywhere in America! Lawlessness rules the day and law enforcement is selective in its enforcement! The fall of America is imminent for many reasons! IJS.
Good going NYPD KEEP DOING A GREAT JOB NYPD.
Look at all the fine outstanding people of color.
I hope they all get deported and no deal is done. because that’s why they keep coming out and keep doing crimes because the feds or the NYPD love to take information from then to keep grabbing more people and releasing this scumbags
how about bloods and cribs ?
So we are all gonna look over the fact that NYC is still being run by Italian mobs ??  Those are the real gangsters them and bvb the police department they all work together...
Free all them
You take them down and a new root grows  .
NYPD good work!!!! Keep at it!!!!! Prayers going up for you all and your families!!!!!
Camera s all ova
If they would keep their hustle about money and luxury, off social media, and violent free, this wouldn't happen so quickly. The problems begin when the shootings starts. Once people die, the feds move in quickly and efficiently. Learn from the past at least if your gonna live a life of crime. Your going down eventually. If you want it to last, keep the feds attention on other, more violent crews. And for christ sake, stay offline. Turn off them EG's and FB's.  Ahh, what do I know. Just a church boy here. Lmao.
The war on drugs is now over
They give us guns and drugs then they wonder in the fuck we thugs ¤
Agud fedem
A NYPD detective gave someone the Bunk interrogation technique.
This people are footsoldier of democratic party .They do dirty work for democratic party .

A bunch of no bodys yall arrested🤣  Knock it off😆never heard of them....LMAO🤣

Legalize drugs!
A bunch of losers that will be out on bond next week!! NYC garbage laws.
NYPD chooses what neighborhoods to let crime rise in because it lowers property values, before the police unions in bed with the Hasidic community buys it up at cheap prices and then decides they want to fight crime
All gang members can not be removed from the streets…..can you remove all police from the streets?
Breaking news idc
That’s not 200k but ok free them they just tryna make it in America just like the Europeans
In Riverdale no one was there? Hmmmm, internal affairs gotta look into that...somEone in NYPD musta warned them, that they left beforehand B4 getting caught
The pandemic set them back a bit? Or DiBlasio set them back a bit.
This is why they keep building jails and prisons  good job now throw away the keys and don't forget those that work in offices and government
Don't forget to check if their here legally 🤷🏾‍♂️
Thank you for all you do NYPD.  Take them all down.  Be careful out there 🤗🤗

God bless NYPD !!!👍👍👍
Legalize and regulate drugs and prostitution
Government create the most violence against its own citizens it Has a monopoly on it why can't we care how other live and how we live in relationships to others.if I care that you live in a home and eat food that wasn't  Slaved products is in the best interest of all of us monetary money is fake made by the banks and government so why cant we do the right thing In the age of cell phones I don't understand why we need a representative government.Great  Documentary I hope to see about the  Legalisation of all drugs and prostitution we don't need government  watch https://youtu.be/1kDXxz1Usa4 Housing is a human/civil right. A system in which access to a human/civil rights is subject to exchange is immoral/unjust. Rent is essentially payment for access to housing. Therefore, rent is immoral/unjust Landlording (if you have any sense of human decency) is not okay. No matter how "nice" you would be to tenants, no matter how much of "a deal" you cut tenants, you are effectively leveraging a person's fundamental need for shelter and survival so that YOU may personally profit. This is exploitative. Period. I'm sure there are a few very rare hypothetical situations someone could bring up to try and challenge how unethical it is to be a landlord, but just the fact that they would have to come up with these very unlikely abstract situations should already tell you more than you need to know. Also, I would like to point out that, historically, virtually every socialist revolution/uprising has to some degree contained land reforms that included at least stripping landlords of their property, and often times the outright execution of the landlords themselves. Something so universal as that doesn't happen without warrent. I hope this doesn't come off as a personal attack towards you, cuz that's not what I'm trying to do, I'm sure you yourself are a cool person, but how aware you are of fucking people over, wouldn't change the fact that you're fucking people over.Why can't every human live in peace. Every human on  Planet  should have the same rights https://youtu.be/oCWB4CMou_M
Makes me sick These offices think they're helping people They are just  Filling their pockets
Fake Unless Orchestrated by idiots to recruit More idiots to Make Money off them - basically wat Green thought he was doing or cud do wit Me Connected to the system devil Etc . . .
Where are the crips and bloods ???
JUST LOOSERS ALL LOOSERS
Damm the whole team went down shawty
Killing each other over stares.  Reminds me of a little kid and their brother or sister 'Mama he's/she's staring at me, make 'em stop!'.
Salute to these men and women who work day and night to keep us safe! Hope our stupid politicians will stay away from bailing them out.
Broadway Bullies, Trinitarios, these Gangs want to be cool so bad. Being in a gang and committing violence against innocent people will never be cool
Money that involves death is evil  , even  if u invest in property  that’s why most  criminals end  up buying useless expensive things   , it’s funny some are kids   We should not only educate our kids but also teach them the gospel of Christ  the devil is a lier I don’t see any future here it’s not late they can still repent and turn to the lord it’s free to turn to Christ you don’t need to pay any thing come as you are .
Sounds great Now im waiting to see the bad police gang to get arrested😆
Toxic human waste,  Shame how the children of today are getting taught all this.
Keep it up!!
Never believe cops
They will be released tomorrow what’s the point
Now that you got some of the so called criminals off the street now clean house and deal with the dirty cops ❤️🖤💚
You knowwww those girls were giving sloppy toppy to the whole crew too!
They will be out in a week
Then their families will act like “ I had no idea 🤷🏻‍♂️”
Legalize drugs and tax them. Use the money and resources to invest in societal needs. Clearly this war is like the other never ending wars that need to be brought to a end.
Don't waste money on housing them in prison. They're needs to be mandatory chained work camps. That's it. They will pay for their stay in prison by virtue of labor.
free da mothers
And nobody arrests the real criminals… the govt officials that allow drugs to enter. The corporations and pharmacists who prescribe prescription drugs they know are addictive. Arrest these dudes and ur politicians as well… the buck shd not stop here. This is minuscule compared to what our govt officials allow to go  on. What about Oliver north? Us gov officials who allow opium from Afghanistan to proliferate the country…the cartel leaders this gov allows to operate. People wake up. These people are small change. U can hear a fart on the other side of the world but u can’t stop drugs  from coming in. Illegal guns? Cut the defense budget and law enforcement and give it to small business and education and trades…when there is prosperity in the underclass…you won’t need law enforcement
Defund the police squawk Democrats and wokesters
WHERE DO THE GUNS COME FROM ❗
Rikers island
wow 😞
Free my people or Imma have to create huge war in America real quick
Tryna hide that face...we know it ain't because ur tryna not catch corona
USA is the biggest hypocrite what about the New York Redstone Family violating human rights why is Sheri Redstone not being charged with laundering sexual harassment embezzlement evading taxes breaking and entering leading a criminal empire running a sweat shop. People of you wanna make it legal put it on camera and sell it to the public
New York houses CBS Viacom which is owned by National Amusement s which is stealing from the poor to get rich and giving nothing back in return so yeah New York actors are acting out gang wars emergencies right Reno 911 CSI new York well acting meet real life
Trump was waaay off with his comments on South Americans 🥸
Let's clean up our streets
Aww. At first, I thought Democrat career politicians take down called gang,  nowadays, that made our cities worst than ever, esp. to their policy🤬🇺🇸
Goodbye
Good
Bums
Gangs is a thing from the 80s... I have no idea why this bullshit keeps goin on...
...The people the runs the country is the real gang members. Speaking of New York, you want to say never forget Nine Eleven, but the mass  wants  to forget slavery.  What a great hypocrisy.
How do you arrest when the system places these drugs onto the streets and the other issue is, are not the police dept considered and classified as a GANG?
Good job fellas
Hey Chicago, take notes.
If you’re trying to make more money, then why can’t you just go to school get yourself a degree and live a respectful life.
That's just the beginning, unfortunately NY city is full in gangs and trashy people, congrats 👏 to NYPD keep good work
man that pendant aint nothing near 200k more like 20k 🤣🤣🤣
Yes.... Clean the trassshhh out!!!! Time to get our streeets safe!!!
What a bunch of losers
I'm Dominican in the Dominican Repúblic and I can say WE the real DOMINICANS do not claim these cabrones.
God always balance evil out with Good.. Good job NYPD..
They already back on the streets, thanks to the new bail law 🤦🏽‍♂️
Teach other cities how to do this. In all cities work in unison and their perspective cities across the United States and shut this down. Yes it can be done. It is no accident that these gang drug dealing murdering people work in poor minority areas. Because if they worked in areas with money prestige and white privilege they wouldn't be there very long. Make it a unanimous United States crackdown. You know where the drugs are coming from you know how they're getting here in the country airplanes boats cars. You already know stop it put it into it act like you care!
Finally. Please do it all over states. Thank you police 🙏
*WASTE OF MONEY AND MANPOWER.* Addiction is a HEALTH issue, NOT a criminal issue. This FAILED WAR ON DRUGS is FAILING to stop drugs because it doesn't treat the actual problem. Quit scaring addicts and doctors!! Make it SAFE for addicts to discuss their addictions with their doctors; make it SAFE for doctors to help patients step down slowly. Focus on helping these sick people, not imprisoning them in some private penitentiary for personal profit gained just because their illness happens to be illegal. This is so backwards. It's just WRONG.
We need to send them to the Taliban.
Some people don't have a moral compass, because they're incapable of loving and respecting themselves.  #bloodyrassduncebats
Pure trash from ……..
It doesn't do any good if they're bailed out right back on the streets
Squads like this are not what Di Blasio is about, he doesn't want any law enforcement.  Sandanistas like DiBlasio know that drugs, illegals, crime, and killings are all part of his plan to destroy YOU.  Di Blasio IS a sandanista.  You can look it up.
go to prison
What about the WS gangs that went up into Capital Hill on January the 6th. The Winter Gang in Boston that has a long streak of bank robberies?
Bravo well done 👏
Why not stop these “Gangs/Crews” by euthanizing all of them.  Why put them in jail, why waste the taxpayers money?  It’s not like they’re willing to be rehabilitated in prison.  They like to “play with guns” stand them up in front of a firing squad!   Then innocent people, little children and seniors citizens can leave their homes again...  Without the fear of getting caught in the “crossfire” of these useless POS!
Is this 80’s/90’s shit still going on?!
We need more of these 3rd worlders

They will be top agents for the FBI against white people within a few days...
darkness falls across the land
hahah
Satan at work
Ya, well that is one part, one gang. What about the rest of   687 gangs, in New York City
Let's see how tough they are after the judge said 30 years in jail
Why the hell are the police protecting them by covering their faces
Look how casual they get out wtf cops shut doors when u raid 🤡🤡🤡
Someone cut a deal lol
Correct me if am wrong but weren’t gangs created to go up against police brutality/government etc? Now these morons out there are forming gangs to kill and fight among each other
No one snitching
I bet they get all that crack to Biden and his son
undercover hahaha all yall exposed now
Rudy guilliany  fixed new York years ago now these Democrats messed it up again
They got the mommas too
And than you will let them go home - tell us what judge do, I bet they going home- don’t ask public nothing y’all releasing them
I grew up in the Bronx in the 50's and 60's and early 70's and we didn't ever have these problems-something has changed-hmm-can anyone on this site figure it out ???
"Gang leader " but the man lives in a basement e his mom .. lmfao .. try doing that to the gang leaders in the US senate
I'm not siding with gangs but how come the feds and the police can't crack down on the white supremacist groups like they crack down on gang members
Great, now take down the gang members on Wall Street.
This is crazy smfh
Outstanding
I hate working 6 days a week and complaining about not making enough money in other words struggling but i rather have this problems then those.
Lovely E.  Here they come
Good get rid of these scum

No comment.
Isn’t nyc courts where they covered up the Epstein shit!? The system is way more corrupt than these low level criminals
Not to worry gangs, Kamala Harris has bail reform money.  Be out by dinner.
We gotta start paying the tax dollars to our shooters and kingpins. To become military and law enforcement
200k🤣
They need to go back to DR with that bullshit gang mierda
Good job police!....Hope the Courts keep these Losers in Jail!
Racist! Racism!  This is racist AF! FREE THEM!          They’re just doing what Democrats have encouraged for generations.
Off the streets for what? A week? Maybe two. To conduct a War on drugs and gangs you must go into the fray with a plan for victory. It must begin at the source. Our military must take out the infrastructure that creates the problem. Eradicating the poppy fields world wide is a good starting place. Destroying the South American factories and labs is good too; even the ones in the Phillippines. Wiping out the entire group who profits from the sales and distribution is good too. Send in the B-2’s and level the mountain hide outs. And if any government does not assist label them enemy combatants too. Without a real war on drugs these apprehensions are pointless and stupid. Additionally, American’s who put their lives and that of their families on the line may suffer needlessly.
BROADWAY BULLIES
And who's  behind them??
Gang members walk in to face the DA.   "Hey, guys.......good to see you again."   Removes handcuffs.   "See you next time. Be careful."
keep them in there
If they eliminate themselves we won't need to do it
That all the money...lol..weak
Not going to stop nun
Elect Sliwa
I thought you reporters be ignorant either it's not gun violence it's people violence

Job well done NYPD 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Lock these bums up! 😭
Phucking the money up smh
Being accused of a crime doesn't mean you are guilty of a crime.
Let’s make it look like the NYPD is cracking down on gangs and lock up a couple of “dangerous” gang members 👍🏾
All the gang members took the vaccine and went crazy 🤪
Every since da laws has change and more open, ** It's okay for officers to get & keep what ever a so call criminal has on them*** with out a Rico case...these officers don't do nothing for the people they rob and call thuggs,and so call protect, come around when they under investigation or lookn for someone then give out bookbags an bike's...they gangs they self......protect the kids and show better by leading by example Officers,
So because pix11 is the only camera der wat you want n award
Great scum off the streets thank you NYPD.
They're ok with gunplay and innocent lives being lost, as long as a pig pulled the trigger.
damn white supremacists .
under cover cop? just like the movies..
YES!!!!! 🤢🎊🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎉🎉
What do you expect in a Democrapic run city...now a Liberal Democrapic judge will drop all charges !
Keeping in jail for life 👈👀
I don't listen to rap
Matatan <°>[:]<°> Ribirin 🐕 👈👀
GOVERNMENT CAN TAKE DOWN ANY GANGS IF THEY WANT TO WHEN THEY FEEL LIKE IT.
I applaud these officers because this gang is linked with the trinitarios . After seeing the gang stab the teenager to death in the store their too dangerous to be in civilized society.
SYSTEM and GOVERNMENT CREATED THAN LOCK 🔐 UP THE POOR.
They were released only hours later….
Politicians and DAs there are made sure that they will get right back onto the streets to prey upon the innocent, so while I applaud the work in arresting them, I have zero confidence that anything will change there, until the voters decide they are willing to put politicians and DAs in office who will back law enforcement.
SAFER STREETS NOW UNTIL NEXT WEEKEND WHEN THEY ARE RELEASED AGAIN AND AGAIN
I hope the city builds statues of them, they earned it.
Soooo are the cops going to get arrested too? That's the biggest gang. I'm just saying....
Karmala Harris's bail money is still out there  for there help.  Shameful.
69 working overtime
Ouuu there cute cops out in the east coast i see yall 👀👀👀

Great job guys we need more arrest on them they are so so bad the NY mayor is no good hes a joke
This doesn't mean shit
So happy are streets are getting cleaned up.
😱
They keep letting people roll up in this country this what happens...border..etc
Damn did anyone catch that he killed one and put the wounded homie in the trunk probably that homie definitely dead
Of course nothing is changing over there.
Good job nypd!!!
I could be mistaken but isn't 1 of those guys arrested, wearing the white shirt is the kid who starred in season 4 of "The Wire"??
If these perps are release for whatever reason, let them reside with the judge and the judge's relatives.
Lots of fan fare for this one
Blm members lol
They'll be free
This needs to happen much more ofteb
RICO
Great job!!!!  Keep these parasites off the streets
Someone else has opened up shop there since this incident occured
Now keep the criminals locked up, citizens deserve peace on our streets, no more useless criminals, zero tolerance
Great “chests” on the ladies tho. Ijs
I’ll Be back out in a week
Wow NYC is turning back into the 90s
And this is why you don't DEFUND THE POLICE!
Selling drugs is dead now days to much technology
Dang.! The Government didn't Arrest Any 1 for The Capital Riot.. I wonder Why..
Wasting tax payer money, that's all they ever do. WHO BROUGHT THE DRUGS HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE?
so they just showed all the faces of their undercover team...and i bet u those are all illegals bringing their shiddy lifestyle to the usa. smh export them
Is there still people smoking  Crack?
200 thousand you spent on a chain & have a public lawyer 😂😂😂smh
And the scumbags will be back on the streets before you read this.   What a joke!
Streets might be safer now
They should be arresting those that bring drugs to USA not these bums. But we know who brings it here they wont arrest themselves for sure 😉
Keep them locked up!!
It's about time thank God they all need to get out down
They'll be right back out on bail
Wallstreet walks
They made the mass gang arrest easy until the court system decided to let them all go due to the stupid endless experiment zero bond BS
Petty take down
Good get those drug slanging maggots off the street
About time they start taking these worthless POS gangs off the streets. Keep this up nypd. These gangs need to be eradicated.
Out before lunch.
Congratulations 16 arrests of the lowest person's on the totem pole. If you don't cut off the head there will always be a replacement.
Damn NY is really Gotham city lol
Them people a be out of jail today judges all about a dollar
No credit to all the snitches who gave up valuable info???? See....all you snitches out there get no love, even from the police 😂😂😂😂😂
Turf or stares.....😂😂😂😂 nah its usually about money and drugs (resources). Kind of like when we invade another country for their resources. When a country doesn't want to deal with us, we take by force.
These thugs keep picking Riverdale because it's close to Marble Hill, Inwood and the Heights. It's easy to run their product and guns up and down Broadway or the Henry Hudson. Riverdale is quiet, not that much crime. This has happened a few times and for whatever reason, no one seems to notice the traffic in and out of these buildings.
Firing squad with machine guns
Those people are already out
Don't let them out prison should be home for theses people...
White NY Liberals: Racist Pigs picking on all those innocent little brown peeps. Where will I get my cheap labor from if they arrest all the brown people
All those arrested look like the criminal element. You know they smell like feet and cornchips
HEELS UP HARRIS WILL LET THEM GO SHE HAS THE BAILOUT FUND FOR CRIMINALS LIKE THE CRIMINAL DEMOCRATS THAT ARE IN THE WHITE HOUSE
Just mostly peaceful crack dealers here...nothing to see here.
They are already back on the street. Why bother?
Arrested the judges and DA who collected money from criminals too
Lol Knock warrants? Wtf.
Proof more laws don’t make you safer. NYC has the strictest gun laws. Criminals don’t care about laws.
gang takedowns? when do police do this?. oh its just this particular gang oh i see. that aint going to do shit.
Small time nickle and dimers, chain snatchers.
Like police
No chinese gangs
U know they snitchin
You can thank the incompetent nyc mayor for the surge in violence. keep voting for democrats  nyers. enjoy your shithole city.

I would like to see the documentary of this case.
Sept 2021: ~47% Of NYPD are vaccinated, I didn’t see any masks on cops and I doubt they’re all vaccinated cops in this squad.
Why does this only happen in democrat ran cities ?
NY is🗑
Racist police department going after these black entrepreneurs. It's not their fault people get in front of their guns
Who the hell uses crack anymore 😐
Wow our lives are changed for the better forever now

Bad boys Bad Boys. Whatcha gonna do?
Not ONE TRUMP VOTER WAS ARRESTED TODAY
Great work squad 🙏🏾
That chain definitely does not cost 200k😂 maybe 20k but for sure not 200k
TAKE AWAY ALL GOVERNMENT ASSISATANCE, LOW INCOME HOUSING PRIVELEDGES AND SO FORTH. YOU DO THE CRIME YOU DONT DESERVE FREE RIDES FROM GOVERNMENT,
200k diamond pendant looks about 25k.🤣
I wish the government would give these set of people option of going abroad to help fight terrorism instead of prison. They would spend number of years they suppose to spend in prison there.
They try be like power from tv show 🤦🏽‍♂️ ain’t going work
They took a lot but the few that are still in that set gonna hold the rests money and be even more rich 🔫🔫😬
This people don’t realize the damage they do to families selling there garbage.
Most likely funded and enabled by Democratic Political Party and Joe Biden Administration, product of a Woke Liberal Community/Government.. MAGA
Bravo well done 👏🏼
69 snitched on them 🤣🤣🤣
Thank you NYPD
Pure Evil pumps Poison to the people in there Community
They will be out of jail, before the inks dry on the warrant.💋🚬🔫👮

Who care the American government can stop a tarriest from getting less than an gram Of Plutonium but can’t stop hundreds of thousands pounds of cocain or herion of the streets 🤔 F.U.
With the new catch and release program what does it matter?
Keep them in jails!!! Don't let them out!!!! Don't waste all that effort! Please!!
"Including crack" 😂
those stacks of bills is nothing compared to what went down in the 80's.....the crack money was phat money!!! none of this nickel and dime bs!! lol
Why watch them commit the crimes before taking them down that's stupid
*The walk of shame, smh... **#cowardswith**🔫*
They ruin NYC keep them in prison!!
Wow! To think that just last week they crossed the southern border. That quick? Wow!

Good! Lock them up!!
Time to clean the trash 🗑️ criminals out the community

Because it's a Hispanic gang they dont want to say the names.... they are Dominican and Puerto rican and other Hispanic gangs... I guess they refuse to name the gang because it doesn't fit the narrative... smfdh😭😭😭
They'll be back on the street doing the same thing next week
Drop them off by parachutes to afghanistan
Over turf or stairs
Nice propaganda piece. "The only camera there"..... yeah cause they invited you there for propaganda. We aren't fooled anymore. The age of information has destroyed the facade of the police&what their about.
Aren't guns illegal in New York city including suburbs. Stupid idiots. Just another Chicago.
I guess that hurricane flushed them out...
Fun Fact:  Every single one was released before this was broadcast.

16 people about to be on bail
The evil liberals judge will let them walk free
Police set them up and locked up several blacks due to systemic racism.
If someone tries to intimidate you and yells Broadway bullies you know your going to laugh. It sounds like a bunch of second graders trying to start a gang
Worthless excuse for a mayor
The biggest gang is the NY government
Why de bozo even talking now? It was all his fault for seeing nyc in danger ⛔️
Send Marines to handle there gang 😎
Lol Broadway Bullies
Chicago needs to the same but unlike the nypd cpd is Corrupt and works along side the gangs.
The blues take down the blasio business out service???
Blasio: Catch and release. Also I will become Governor.
Put them on death row
But in a Libtard Socialist Commie ran State like New York. They'll be back on the streets terrorising in a few short days.
1 bullet each. I'll donate my hard earned money to donate. And problem solved.
God Be The Glory. Wrong is wrong. Bad is bad. Anybody here or is it just me? you ever notice when gangs are caught by cops, they somehow always led away in handcuffs and for innocent black stop for a traffic stop or something they shouldn't hanging on the mirror they are beating and die. Why is it that bad even protect bad but the good get bad? Now, I am glad black or white if your a gang up to no good you deserve  to be in handcuffs and up and away.
Just keep saying gangs do this gangs do that but don’t anything
They don't mind getting arrested they out next day.
Grown Broadway bullies? At least the guy with the purple bomber tried to impede the shooter.
Knock search warrant....  these scumbags should be no knock period.
Ok great the police did their part. Now is the DAs office going to do their job, are the courts going to do their jobs. Are these evil parasites going to be permanently removed from society
They will get no bail and be out in a jiff.  Probably get paid by the government every week.  Maybe even get free housing until the don't show up for their court date.
All minors no problem slap on the wrist back doing crime by sundown thank you GOVERNMENT SYSTEM
How about you guys start with the shitty politicians in office...
Let them kill each other.
AOC's distict. Just oppressed people trying to get bread and the racist police won't let them.
Funny thing Is the CIA will have a new kingpin and drug runner
Yea don't worry guys this is NY you'll be out soon .
Useless

Every city needs $$ for funding of police departments. Take down the gangs and collect.
Black Lives Matter, Dittohead!
Do NYC cops have fitness requirements ? lawd amercy band of brothers tee wearing mfer out of shape like a mfer
0:06 gang name
Throw Away the key! Where is that mayor and new Governor going to parties for the democrat party.
Why are you arresting them?  This is the culture Biden and demoncrats promote. Come on man !! Biden, JayZ and Cardi B should throw a concert to free these people.
Deport all these trinitario back to dominican Republic
The only guy who didn’t look like an undercover was the big black dude, but even he was wearing a band of brothers shirt. Never trust a middle aged bald dude in a faded Red Sox t shirt
I'm so glad Lord delivered me from that life style..🙏🏽🦶🏿
Gang gang GANG 😂
They'll be out soon. Was the Mayor's daughter part of that arrest?
They need prison good job officers.

Great! Since they're taking thugs down, and gangs, maybe they can focus o the gang that's currently in office and against the american people! They're laundering money and plaguing the citizens of america!
The war on drugs is a complete failure, you will never stop prostitution and you will never stop man, from medicating himself.
Y’all catch more drug dealers then sex traffickers f**k outta here🙄🙄🙄
Decriminalize all drugs, because the current war on drugs never work and will never work.Innocent civilians will continue to be in the cross fire....
Why go through all this trouble cops? Those scum you arrested will be out in a few months anyways. Justice system is a joke. Its a revolving door for these criminals who should be locked at least 20 yrs.
They better NOT be released.
The gang must not have paid the monthly bribe.
Like one commenter said this is what the police should be doing...not harassing a citizen that's holding a camera recording in public...
They should've hit all stash House simultaneously.
In Riverdale? Sounds about right.
This is our fault as a city
There be a new gang in there by the end of the week lol
We need this in Chicago. And a new Mayor.
"Drugs including crack "lmfao
Who cares it’s bill Diblasios harlem. Wonder if bill Diblasios wife is in this gang? She did steal one billion dollars in tax payer money by any means necessary
Worst NY mayor ever
3:09
Damn young ma
Police do the work just so they can be let out of jail the next day!
FAKE NEWS! THE NYPDK IS A CRIMINAL GANG ANYONE DUMB ENOUGH TO BELIEVE IT GET WHAT THEY DESERVE
Meanwhile police & white supremacy gangs & cults been caught infiltrating law & we have over 76% non violent people locked up & yet not the corrupt police, Congress, presidents or or bankers involved in organized crime. Smh
Those dealers sucked at their jobs
They are done, like a brotha
Thank you NYPD!!!
Nothing but a bunches of brothas
Why are they hiding their faces, they're Gangsters right🤷🏽
White people arresting minorities. They better put some white people in their gangs. Aren't there any equal opportunity laws?
Slavery sucks.
Depot them
Drop in the ocean
Hopefully the district attorney office must charge them for conspiracies to murder, and not attempted murder and let them turn on each other and they will be able to kiss freedom bye bye... into 10 years or more.
Fighting over turf that belongs to New York City cant even pay they rent #moyetti
https://youtu.be/68BmGfxqZzM
Get them off the street drain the swamp #johnnyx100 👈🏾👈🏾👈🏾👈🏾 ☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻
Democrats achieved their goals,  now it's time to put them back where they belong. Use and abuse. Better wake up.

You want to defund the police ?  pay the price
Shit, I bet half the force knew about it.
Wow its a WRAP 4 them
That pendant ain't 200k 🤣🤣
Please 🤣🤣🤣they will all be out in 3hrs
Omg lmfao that diamond charm is not worth $200k nor did someone pay that.. They always put to much on it like when they say the drugs are worth this much when they bust someone it's always 10 times more then the real price lol
If they weren't shooting people.  Let them go
BLM… would say they’re innocent hard working ppl
Wait a minute! Not one mask huh? WOW! But YOU MUST FOLLOW!?
Stay safe 💙
I can hear the snitching and flipping going on even as you read this..... 🐦
This is so so sad granddaddy,grandma,moms,uncles an aunties. Well DANG THE WHOLE DANG FAMILY !!!!

Good job police. These losers have no morals..
Don’t ya love trash collection
Lol and they want to defund the police people crazy.
Lol and throw away the key for awhile.
Loving the work the NYPD doing 👏 now put them away for life
How many are illegals? Why is nobody at least asking when innocent civilians are dying everyday?
Diversity is our strength
FTP
Oooh yikes!
Simple…start giving them death penalties right away..especially if they are guilty of murder. I guarantee you the crime will stop.
Why would they show the officers faces?
God is watching and still in control. God bless our officers who worked hard to catch these people
Good
heck yea!!!!!!!!!
Suspects- Just more “Aspiring Rappers” who is “Good Kids” and they “Didn’t do nothin”
Melanated people are more compassionate- Nick Cannon
Television shows like Empire, Power and all that stuff…is influencing people that watches these things believing the idea by re-enact these fictional drama shows is something okay to romanticize and glamorize in real life, but in real life it all just looks stupid and it’s stupid when a person wants to believe in something so fictional is some real life experience it’s so stupid.
And with Deblasios bail reform, their already back out on the street.
Put there fucken asses in prison each an one of them for ever!!!!
All I see is straight As students and BLM activists
It's about time they start getting these streetgangs all the time it's always the Italian mafia what about the Bloods there's a lot of them in New York and they do drugs and prostitution in all time to take them down to you can just take one game down you gotta take a bunch of them at a time that's how you get rid of them
❤❤❤❤
Racism! Only people of color
I have to give them credit for not resisting arrest.
FAWTY YEARSS
This it's really funny video.. Like the streets are safe now .. LOL
Right
Wow
Wow
follow the money, follow the drug users ...
I'm glad and grateful 🙏 that life is behind me in my 20s I used to sell narcotics for over 12 years. Not glorifying that lifestyle you either end up dead or in jail.
Thanks to liberal democrat politicians and policies, these people will be out the next day 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ik that officer in the band of brothers tee was smoking so much crack while undercover
No jail time,wasting taxpayer money, just put them to DEAD
Thats small time how bout the real people behind the real crimes like the demorats ruining ur city????????? Biden son hunter, the cuomo brothers ocasio cortez the penguin Jerry nadler, nancy pelosi, bill gates, the clintons,  the obamas , the list goes on and on oprah?????
Yeah New York police.
Give me a break... We know the cops in that area are on the take.
They all need to face harsh consequences.
Execute all of them. Justice served  The biggest problem with these hoodlums is they have no gun safety training or marksmanship. The degenerates seem to hit everyone but each other
Finally
Why they so mean.lol
Lol see that little money on the table and two 380 between 16 people 🤣 and one peace they all going  Split   it now day u can't make alot of money in gangs they all  Mine is well getting 95 and save the trip to jail
Mad world...
Fuck its about fucken time! It's no gang war! Its the stupid politicians allowing them go on a crime spreed! When are you the media are going to say to yourself "you kniw what guys, this is not right. We need to start telling people what is really going on" you will come face to face with god almighty. And you will be judged by him.
Good for you New York show them gang's who's the boss! Chicago watch and learn!
Good!!! Go get them all… There’s entirely too much gangster glorification making this seem like an attractive lifestyle to the youth. This problem plaguing our streets is out of hand!!
😂 they’re not scared to go to jail. They’ll fit right in and be at home.
That's so good, because the streets are getting so dangerous, this should be done in every city .Chicago is just so  bad, people getting rob while waiting on the bus, and the carjackings are just out of hand .I really think Chicago needs the National guards.... If I was in control and if people got to shoot guns, Rob people ,and  shoot the police, you're not going to be allowed on the street ,it's going to be a curfew, and every car driving down the street getting checked, so it's ways to stop the violence .The people in charged and able to make rules have to stop playing with those outlaws !
Need to take down antifa and the other ones!
I'm going to bet they didn't care about the NYC gun laws.
😂😂they fenna post bail
those designer items are fake especially that LV bag
Great job guys really great job
well there goes my weed guy....
That's how u do it take them all trash ass people
Good. Don’t forget about 45
How come Rico case don't apply for the CIA? Rules for the but not for me. CIA trafficked tons of cocaine from South America back in the day and not one person was ever accountable for it.
Good. Get some more of them. Sick of this cancer in our communities. Go to Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, Atlanta and anywhere else and round them up too!! Sick of these dumb asesss! Killing innocent people! For no reason
To hell with all of them. Life sentences with no parole will suffice.
This is great propaganda
Well 6ix9ine could help clean NY up
Is that Bradly Martyn selling his drugs
TRASH BELONG IN THE GARBAGE,  CRIMINALS BELONG IN JAIL, EVIL BELONGS IN HELL.  THANK YOU POLICE FOR BEING BRAVE AND FOR MAKING AMERICA SAFE. THANK YOU
Lol at the reporter saying 200 “k”  . Straight reading from a card . This is live Lady not a tweet lol
This is actually good police work. Fuck those scumbags. How are gang even still a thing in 2021 😂
Finally some good news. Thanks to the investigators and nypd
"Son, GET UMMM"
DEFUND MEANS DEFUND.....JUST ASK ANY DEMOCRAT.
Instead of killing these bastards just cut off a limb.
End the drug war. You dont see liquor store owners and workers shooting at eachother
Of course one of the cops has a Rasta colored shirt on how ironic I think he needs to be drug tested
Oh well....bye 👋
The yo's with their hoodies on.
when the police control the drug trade😂
I support the NYPD
And they will be right back out like always debozo nyc
Thats is one pathetic bust very few dollars or drugs the should be ashamed of themselves
Broadway bullies?!? That is the most fabulous gang ever, what’s their flag color the rainbow?
But there’s gun laws and drugs are illegal how is this still happening maybe making laws that will never work isn’t a good idea, but nah endless drug war and empowering drug cartels sounds much better
Deport them
All that money just to buy fake LV purses😂😂

GOOD JOB NYPD!!!!
Look at they face on the corner Now look Now 😂 tu no eres un gangster tu eres un Bum.
Good work by the Police. Scumbags shoukd be held without bail and heavy sentences.
Cowards cant even hold their head or show face.
Mama thought she was building an empire 😏 sloppy asses😄
Let’s point the finger at the real culprits.  This is a joke!
nice work! Out on bail in couple of days?
I wonder how many those cases are gonna stick
Relentless police work? People get killed on camera and nothing happens man they just got lucky nypd don’t do anything
Lock them up and throw away the key.
Free my niggas
Put there THUG A*S AWAY FOR GOOD 👍
Has anyone noticed how the urban communities across the country have been targeted every since the election ? In every ghetto USA right now .
Im.glad at 18 i went for a walk with my friend we where gun down by gang member he was trying to force us into sex trafficking . we escaped that morning they where to high to function. Gang are not something you want around your young children. The guy got 20 yrs plus
Somebody talking and tellin. I betcha it’s a felon 🤣🤣🤣🤣
👏👏👏👏👏
Trash bags off the streets 💪
Probably the reason they arrested them because they are latinos not  a black gang
If they have nationals domicans deported them
What's lil momma bail 🤷🏾‍♂️
About time!
Dang c19 don’t stop shat! Not even gang bangn!
But what about the child traffickers ? This is find and dandy
THEY MEAN NASTY
THEY IN COURT ROOM THROW CHARGES 9 11 DAUGHTER CREW DID IT
Butler is trying marry mayo allen she not for sale u creep
IM NOT A GANG MEMBER  MAGGEN IM PUNH IN FACE
Throw out the trash
Not many lady cops in the takedown operation.
I support the death penalty for drug dealers.
All LeJogger.
The jail out there gotta be over crowded .....
They need to get these low life no good to society things out of our community take a sledge hammer and slammed them between there nut sacks
Criminal empire? Guess it's cause I'm from Tx but that's a very small stack of cash
Imagine buying a 200000$ necklace instead of investing in your future.
This is great! Even if released or out on bond, these gang bangers know they are targets and probably under surveillance so they’ll think twice before committing crime like shooting and beating people up out in public/broad day light so the community is much safer. Also, they’ll assume and question every drug sale if it’s an undercover buy so they’ll have that fear slowing them down.  👏
Give them all life
You can thank Democrats for letting all these foreigners in. Mind you black people get blamed for al this without the news actually covering this.
Good job! Now take down the gang members in the NYPD.
They will be out on bale & back doing what they do. Garbage people. Liberal politics.
Pro Biden voters arrested?
NYC still has police?
NY is disgusting.
Once again these people 🤷🏿‍♂️
THATS RACISMS !!! CALL A SOCIAL WORKER !!!!
I'm really against stupidity like this shooting where kids are put in the line of fire are forced to do things they don't want to .... But then how often does the law play a role in it by letting out snitches to  sell drugs and put lives in danger as well and claim no responsibility think ....it goes both ways how many real crooked cops are part of it and never pointed out ....this is why I say when will we start being smart about everything. ...and saying its the law when we play right into there hands.👂👂👂👌👌👌👌
Good take the trash off the streets now y’all need 2 go 2 Chicago especially after that one month old was shot in the head from gang trash like this
😂 that lil ass money 😂 lets admit this gang isn’t Getting that much money
Im sure those criminals all got those guns legally ans a background check would have prevented it, I say this sarcastically.
It is unbelievable and just shocking how these officials think we are such fools, they called this unbelievable spike in crime gang activity.  They refuse to acknowledge the crime has gone up simply because of lack of enforcement these are not all gang members these are just criminals taking advantage of a weak system.  I’m sorry New York City we are not fools.
🤦🏾‍♀️
The cops have arrested over 64 people on the eastside and westside of Harlem, NY over the last week!
Gangs are DeBlasio's core constituents. His homies.
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that Hector is going to be running three Honda civics with spoon engines, and on top of that, he just went into Harry’s and bought three t66 turbos with nos, and a motec exhaust system!
Rico got em
NYPD ain't playing!!!👍👍👍
Wondering how many of these criminals are not only going to walk away, but walk away millionaires after the ACLU steps in, lets them off because the warrants contained a grammatical error and forgot a comma, and win a nice settlement in court for them?
Lock them up and throw away the damn key....
Hell I couldn't tell the cops from the crooks. Do they dress like that just to try to get A gun fight started
Don't trust De Blase
These gang members are a bunch of leftists like the rest of NYC. I bet you they are in bed with corrupt politicians, currupt police officers, and corrupted correction officers. Other wise they wouldn't be on that level of criminal activity. Criminals get rewarded in ways where they see no need to be a good person in NYC2021. They will be home soon. Just another day in the streets of New York.
Now to keep them in jail. That’s the real work!
Shot I used to live there on 135th.
Good stuff man, maybe know some babies, and civilians won't be killed.
As long as they get no bond it just might work out !!
Look at all of these terrorist. Idiots
That pendant is 6k at best
I cant tell whos the bad guy huh cause we all no good we just make ourselves look good by putting dirt on people s names i bet the guy in charge of operations b touching kids he aint get caught yet or beat the wife the truth is ugly yall we know it
👍🏻 good
No thanks to the High Ditz
send them back to the Dominican Republic
It stays hot in new york & I'm not talkin about weather. The rotten apple.
That's the u.s. marshals that's what they do it takes four years to investigate they put the drugs out there they put the weapons out there have you buy them and sell them then arrest you that's how the system works
Turf???? Stairs???? and they own what property???
2018 are you kidding me how much tax money is spent on that
Social media is it getting all y'all caught up you got to move like the mafia they got caught cuz they got lazy thank God I don't live that life no more
Good job making the streets safer for whatever amount of time that may be 😎👍🏼
People have gone insane... no care for humanity or themselves. Lock them up for life.
Really weird, criminals have no problems getting guns in New York
For years the lame reporters claim they locked up gang after gang when gang members say the mass criminals are the ones reporting the news, making arrest and prosecuting.
You gotta make sure they don’t grow in jail
This gang was living fancy by  destroying peoples lives. Its so sad this is happening all over the world.
Way to go NYPD. At the end of the day all the matters is the safety of new York residents. Well damn just tell everyone at the end what the plan is to do.
We sick of gangs already they plate terrorist in America enough is enough they are cold and violent
NYC disappointment rats
If there are no Federal charges involved in this. Each gang member will probably get 10-15 years in prison plus parole,until decided. No place is safe anywhere. They live and die by the sword.
Good Job! Go NYPD Go!!
A disgrace. To their community. Event hosting ... I wonder which "events". Shut those events down. Evict them seize their property make their asses homeless when they get out them and their kids and the whole family. Way too much garbage in this city.
Great reporting #NicoleJohnson 😉!
These are gang members please
No matter what happens hands will exist as long as the government allow drugs into america so blame the government for letting drugs in and for not helping people succeed in life where they choose to sell the drugs
Thank You NYPD for Cleaning house. Even though it's a small dent but it's a great start. #supporttheblue
This will end soon.
Whoever wears clean shoes an don't work themselves don't deserve to say be safe take the be safe an stuff it
No gun play out there cmonnnnn
Thanks deblasio 🖕🏿
Gangs can have guns but good citizens can't. Hm..
The DA and liberal judges only want to put fake vaccinate card holders in jail.
I’m from the tri-state area.  I also lived some years in Flatbush. Since when did dudes start wearing hoodies in 80 degree weather? These dudes these days over dress in layers. I know people will say they were robbing people back in the day with hoodies and ski mask fine. But all these dudes are wearing hoodies. What’s up?
Well, good luck keeping these Lowlifes in Jail.
Good get them off the street.
Well this a start all them kids that died it should have been faster
New York police department is in if itself a gang
What are we going to do about the police gangs
THE MEDIA ALWAYS TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR! A BUNCH OF BULLSHIT
Mona Scott we not dumb I swear this person announcing this news sounds like Mona Scott
THIS WAS ALL  ORCHESTRATED, BY THE EVIL SYSTEM TOO MANIPULATE THE MINDS OF THE MASSES! DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!
thank you for what you do officers I thank God for you and I pray that no weapon is form against u in the name of jesus,  thank u for your service and I don't even live in that state but I appreciate your police work  ,,  🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
670 riverside drive has a drug ring  a gang living in several apartments 2e and 3c and about four or five other apartments in the building.
Keep them away from the streets and get rid of bail reform.
Unfortunately these gangs are shooting each other!??? Thats a good thing let the scumbag thugs take each other out and save the taxpayers from feeding and housing these idiots just to continue their gang activities while in the joint.
😂 gangsters..they will be gangbagers in prison showers 😂
Thank you good job
As a New Yorker my city deserves all this and so do the idiot democrats that keep voting in the poor liberal leadership
Rings this big usually pay off officials.... ijs anyone can be bought
lol Mayor Deblowjobio is one of the traitors encouraging this behavior 🤣 send him to prison as well
Yes so glad you'll got them don't never allow them out again.wevthe people ask in the name of our children.
Beans
A.b.m
I hope they save some bail money or some investment money but I forgot they not educated on investment etc
Maaan. In NY, when shots are fired the rule is Duck and Cover. Been like that. The game wont change. This is Amerikka. Duh!
Flush the chit down the toilet. Human garbage needs to be disposed of.....
Gang member is just another way to say loser
Thats how you fight the gang👍👍👍
they all puss*
Isaiah 53:5, he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes, we are healed.   For salvation, we just need to follow the way they did it in Acts? They were baptized in water for the removal of sins and filled with the Holy Ghost. Here's why! The gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians 15:1-4. If we are to follow him, we must do the same thing. Death= repentance, Burial = baptism, and resurrection = being filled and rising again from the dead. That's what Acts 2:38 is.  We must obey the gospel, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that OBEY NOT THE GOSPEL of our Lord Jesus Christ... Matthew 7:21-23, Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that DOETH THE WILL OF MY FATHER which is in Heaven. St John 3:3-5, EXCEPT a man, be born of WATER AND OF THE SPIRIT, he cannot enter into the kingdom of GOD.  We can't come up with our own gospel. Galatians 1:8-9, But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. Don't be cursed.  One way for all people. Jews, Gentiles, and Samaritans. Our salvation has to match up with the scriptures and no scriptures on the subject can be taken away.  Eternity is TOOO long to be WRONG! st, John 5:39, Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.  The gospels show what Christ has done on the cross for us. The book of Acts shows us the beginning of Christ's Church and how to enter the Church, obeying Acts 2:38.  The letters were written to the Church to show us how to behave now that we are born again into the Church.  It's better to walk alone than to walk with a crowd going in the wrong direction.  Are we supposed to follow the teachings of the apostles? Acts 2:42, And they continued steadfastly in the apostle's doctrines. Ephesians 2:20, We are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone.  Don't get Titus 3:5 mixed up with James 2:14-26, about WORKS. One is a WORK of your OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS OR GOOD DEEDS and the other is a WORK OF FAITH.  Titus 1:16, They profess that they know God; but in WORKS they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate. If you believe in this message, be blessed by God in helping to spread it in the name of Jesus Christ so people can get saved the right way. God bless you..
Go America!
Broadway Bozos!! That crew is not a subset of the Trinitarios at all. I know cause I'm from the neighborhood and know who most of them punks are.
If they in a gang, they deserve the bang.
Not the super minorities  the best hardest worker the did more and deserve more than Blacks born here survivors of the world's greatest crime in history. The descendant of slaves in  America over 500yrs of free forces labor subjugate in a country built on Anti Black hatred. A no country to go to across the  border had to fight for their civil right that everybody benefits more than those who was murder beaten of those civl right. The listen in this dance with the devil seed they will throw you down, build you up to throw you down. Learn how they work with B1 Professor Black Truth fact 💯 he knows his enemies like the back of his hand sub life changing info.
New York city Always Been About Drugs And Gangster This is Not Nothing New how many Gangs are there in NY I wonder
Ignorance of others
Like the decades ago
All these cameras in NYC how can this take so long
The gang leaders, suppliers and bosses have been playing from the 'Power' script since easing into Riverdale  around 2008/2009.   They started out on the DL but now they've been shitting where they eat.
Simple minded individuals.  Fighting over turf, ok property you don't even own.  Public streets, Apartments you rent aka owned by somebody else, areas of land that tax payers pay maintenance for. Talk about turf put your name on the dotted line, you own nothing.  Even buying property &  land still never truly yours because if you don't pay taxes & maintenance  on it, it can still  be taken away🙈.  Senseless gun violence because this my area but yet you own no acres of land. If they wanted a legit business  they could have had it, but instead out here causing senseless wars.  At what cost, life for life what difference is going to make if your spending it locked up like caged animals. Now you have someone else  telling you when to sleep, eat, shower, piss etc., begging for rights you taken for granted for the remainder of your life.    Back in the day people fought old skool with their hands, even gangs way back in day where more postive out to protect the community, We in different time now, they & we killing one another over bs, a gun is easy way out, when you fight with your hands really fight one on one the damage feels like nearly death but that person lives to see another day but they know you aren't anything to play with because impact and your mark was left.
Give them the death penalty
High five 🙌
Buh bye 👋
Wow actual police work, this IS news.
They are not outlaws no pigs were shot
Harlem was all like that please from the 90s good job to police
Come on NYC, make the city safe once again
They ll b free next day thanks to liberal laws.
All white boys going out to raid ur crib smfh
Take them all and give them life no just kill them it's a lot safer 👍🇺🇲🇺🇲⚖️🇺🇲🇺🇲⚖️🇺🇲⚖️🇺🇲
FUCK TRINITARIOS  ! AMOR DE REY !
It's interesting that there were only like 3 women involved in this yet the women are the thumbnail.
Stone Flb 🏴🤜🏽💰🚶🏿😊2021
You all do all that investigation to take down the drug dealers and not the supplier, this a joke...
Give them the needle. Good job cops.
if they could pool their brain cells would solve most of this.
You should hang all of them in the street.
Execute them all!!
Do they have a car big enough for the fat chicks?  That is why  these diabetics need guns, nobody can fight with their hands.
That chain was not 200k lol
They should call them terrorists and send them to guatanuomo.
If they wanted to really stop crime they would be investigating the rich and wealthy
THEY DON'T FLASH GANG SIGNS.....TO ENTER, IT'S...FOSSIE FOSSIE, TWIST, TURN, THEN JAZZ HANDS
Gun play.
You're next mayor is probably someone in that group.
Why are you hiding your face
Diblasio and social worker will give them Mets tickets
Damn! What ever happened to protecting your own turf from rival gang members and mtg on neutral grounds  to fight where there aren't any innocent bystanders? I was never in any gang but I did have friends back in the 70's who were and that's how it was done.
What about the biggest gang the NYPD?
There are so many gangs that won't do anything
Put all their butts in prison
1:17 🤣 yea right
good job
👏👏👏👏
so where the black live matter at? where lechina james at ?
Thank God they took them down,please God bless the law enforcement officers protect them 🙏to doing their job 🙏Amen!!
Damn white supremacists
Brilliant work! We're tired of people dying.
Yeah right the white people are the founder of these gangs I mean the fat fish tell me if am wrong when have you seen a black teen with a gold chain 250 thousand Dollar opsss maybe Criss Brown or Floyd MAYWEdER Jr
All these wannabe gangstas don't realize their hurting themselves and everyone else too. Just go to school, get a job and live your life with freedom. ....
Something is wrong with this story or you have actors. There is a police station right across the street. Ain't no way gangs are going to go at it there.
This sounds like the mafia and old tv shows, like ‘The Untouchables’. There’s always been gangs and gang families. Some Italian King Pins and crime bosses are probably still behind bars. The movie, The Godfather tells some of the ruthlessness of those mafia gangs. I don’t think gangs will ever disappear because they represent family to lots of lonely, displaced people, who are left out of opportunities and the pursuit of happiness, based on what they look like or what side of the track and zip code they happen to be born in.
Damn got moms daughter n daughter smh
Why in the hell don't you walk their sorry asses out in front of the cameras without the hoods on?
Good 👍 throw the book at them life without parol The Wages of Sin is Death💥💥💥💥
Ask AOC for HER input. She has the answers for everything. Her answer is.....Defunding the Police will solve ALL problems
Sounds like the government to me...
The walk of shame... Obviously they need to pick a better line of work.  Clowns cowardly types.  Thank you law enforcement..👍
Refund the police to do their jobs.People needs to live in peace .Natural disaster and man made pandemic is enough death ...Keep them in jail far away ....May a state for them to work get and education and feed themselves
Another white supremist gang taken down!
Ship them to Guantanamo
I see there all brown if they where black not a word would have been said or any action done
MAY THE MOST HIGH GOD BLESS AND PROTECT THE PASSIONATE AND REAL MEN AND WOMEN OF THE NYPD AMEN
One down a few hundred more to go. Better odds playing wack a mole.
YEA LOCK ALL THEM UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEY ALL OF THEM EVEN THIER KIDS
Good! Now deport them!
Trump 2024
Gun “PLAY”? You mean violence or what? Cause they killing peoples out here that’s not playing.
Look at all those white supremacist.
Send them to the Dominican Republic and let them do their prison sentence there and remove any and all chances of citizenship.
People like this should be barred from The US forever!!!
Good lock there ass up permanently!
Those girls coulda found a man. Instead they found a Cage 🤣
Good. I hate bullies.
Bravo nypd
But they were just try to earn extra money, to pay rent and foods, they lost job during pandemic.
Good, now they system will let them out as they will post bond and do it all over again 🙄
they will be released  by the end of day waste of time
They would get out on bail.
How many were from the border and diblasiomis in charge don't worry you guys will be out before you can say the word democrats 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The hip hop community strikes again
The legal system keeps letting them out.  Those judges need to be reviewed.
Please court system don't let them out  Please
I use to roll wit these guys back in the day🙏🗣💯💀did over 20+ years in the NEW YORK PENINTENTARY......real respect real.....we only live once.....ENJOY FREEDOM & LIFE ITSELF......ITS ONLY TOP NOTCH IF NOT OFF SHELF......video made me write this post.......ONE LIFE & ONE LOVE ...🗣💯
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 If only they were the only bad ones, because how many others (apparently) on the right side of the law have looked the other way and being paid to do so…??? ⚖️
Theses 16 people are probably already back out on the street doing the same shit due to making bail that they probably paid with unemployment money
Excellent!     they have been sliding front men and women  into and renting in Riverdale for a while.    Now get those businesses they have established to front with in Riverdale
And they STILL won’t mention the common denominator. If they ever do, maybe you can actually start to solve the problem
Wow 😳
Wow really this fool really baggin' ppl in a Wu-Tang shirt. Kmt.@3:05🙄
Y'all shooting each other over government section 8 housing. Let's be real. No generational wealth. No real goal in life. Nothing to offer anyone in the community but bullets
That's why old drug dealers getting out of the game, this generation doesn't know how to move in silence. They want the grand stage.
NYC IS FULL OF RATS!
Bring back the Gang Task Force like they did in the 90s.....
Good!!!! Get these A-holes off the streets!!!!
All Dummies are in the Can....
Extremely interesting.
Aren't the police supposed to be wearing masks, especially considering the high amount of them that are unvaccinated? We should stop spending billions on their healthcare until they do.
They all Snitching
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
my cousin famous
Beautiful catch..Mr mayor! Who's talking about defunding
Can't believe anything the NYPD say
I'm sure the judge and prosecutors will drop all charges and award them compensation
It's NY they will all be out by end of week, city ran by a bunch of lefttards!!
Usual suspects I see!!😆
Death penalty to anyone convicted. smh
Bro they look like they was just getting by not no real money lol
In what city's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's what I thought
It’s always the same looking people.
Damn jail sucks wait until they see big Bruno behind bars then they are going to know!👁🙊🤔
Hang all those goons
Put the gang members in a locked van and drive it into the Ocean! Fuck courts, judges and DAs. Just get rid of these sad excuse for humans.
Black rise matters
Oh look a jogger team!!
Welcome to Biden and the democrat party America!!
Oh look it’s a jogger team!!!!
Everyone arrested should be proud of themselves of what they've become ... congrats 🤣
Thank You, Police Officers, for what you do for us!!  You are the best!
Thank you NYPD.
Why don't the locals just kill them that's what would happen in my neighborhood.
So Sophisticated they got caught
0:15 George Floyd?

Right on, good job police. Whoever let the cops do their jobs finally I salute you. This is what happens when the cops are allowed to be cops not babysitters. Now i guarantee that between the lawyers and the judicial system half of them will be out of custody doing the same stuff. At least they cant kill anyone for a little bit.
Stupid De Blasio youre the one who wants to defund the police. So this has nothing to do with you. He always destroys videos with his presence.
GANG GANG A NO NO  https://youtu.be/F0xWGB4VhH0
dreamers doing what is rampant in their  culture, mexico and central america..thx libs! build TWO walls!
Now that the blue gang aren't hunting down the demon plant cannabis while being hopped up on coffee we should see more of this good job NYPD
Good job NYPD God-bless all of ya  Be safe..go back home to your family...keep them of the street. Away from US and  Children and innocent bystanders.🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲.. Bring back our streets Send them back where they belong
Don't worry Kathy hochul will continue to abide by andrew cumoms baill reform policies. She will make sure they are back on the street. We all know that will never affect her or her cronies. She worked with cuomo and they are one in the same
Great work.. now what if the mayor actually supported them...
Off to Rikers Island
This remind me of the mob
I swear New York took out like 30 gangs in three years.
there was a man in Germany who knewhow to deal with problems like this.
active dreamers
Damn why they low-key look ready!!

esau love taking down Jacob down, but  jan. 6 gang attack he seems he can't find them. Well like TMH say satan angainst satan he can not find fault in themselves.
You think these are bosses ? These people are a joke. You took down a small click
What a waste of time they will be back on the street in a day or two.
Saw an armed cop outside the PIX11 building for the first time today. I’m sure it’s no coincidence
Lol. Why make such a big deal about their arrests when one of your wonderful libtard judges will get them off? When you people stop electing democrats the world will begin caring about your plight again.
Yup, now after the arrests, I wonder how many will be let back onto the streets by liberal judges. No thanks to incompetent part- time mayor, but NEW YORK'S FINEST. The men & women in blue put themselves at risk everday for us, making arrests. All that hard work sometimes goes down in vein by a single judge!!. What a shame!!. God bless the NYPD!!!.
THANK YOU NICOLE AND CHANNEL 11 MY FAMILY WATCHES YOU EVERY DAY GOD BLESS YOU AND PLEASE STAY SAFE OUT THERE  THANK YOU 🙏 AGAIN
Lol remaking of the wire wannabes
All this is hype, it's all about the money, if they took this long to make a stage show appearance then the king pin is not the king pin that's BS, he's probably the guy taking the wrap but for that kind of crime is never so simple that in  a few min a news channel is giving you all the answer. Cash is king the bigger boys will step in once bail is set and they will be back out again not all of them only the ones that's vip. 16 people?really? That's it? This is all smoke and mirrors to make you feel safe. As long as De balsio is the mayor we will never be safe.
What kind of shit is this ? 🤨🤦‍♂️...man shout out to these units. These dudes must be living in Grand Theft auto video game world. Fuck wrong w/ these weirdo’s. They addicted to crime or some shit smh 🤦‍♂️
They be let go 🚶and back on the street in no time.
Footage of them leaving jail the same day: "This is the result of Soros backed commie DA's"
Too little too late….
These gangs should go to Afghanistan to see what real gangs are like
How about covering up those officer's faces to protect them in the long run.
they just wanted milk and bread,whats the big deal?
https://youtu.be/oWUwui0In5s
These low life losers should be in prison forever. They literally offer nothing productive to society. Good job NYPD! Thank you for your work!
The needle dicked, soy latte drinking quacks that are responsible for the policies that breed this stuff, never have to live with the consequences of their ideas.
They need that unit on 144th street from riverside drive all the way to Amsterdam ny ny.
make sure no bail
Good job
NYC is becoming Ireland 🇮🇪. A crime infested place
"There is a lot of money in that white powder".  Here we see a white supremacist drug gang caught.
I pray for our safety teams always!!! A. K. A Law Enforcers! They need all the prayers they can get! May they always go back to their families in one Peace 🙏🙏🙏 God bless and protect u all! The real heroes!
Mother's?
Diversity
Not one cop has a mask on
The most expensive game of tag youll ever see
If authorities did their job there would be no drugs.If u cannot stop them crossing the border u have to admit the policy needs to change after 60 yrs of war on drugs.Time to legalise & regulate & end this criminal behaviour.Chase big pharmaceuticals.The only difference is 1 word legal & illegal at the stroke of a pen.Then the crims will have to find something else to do.
The public help and the  undercover cops Can't Forget Their snitches
The crackhead mess of Broadway from 225st 228st 230st 231st marble hill playground is used like drug useing supermarket.
Not even a dent put in it.  But good work nypd
These mofos in suits are the ones that need to be arrested.... Gotta laugh to keep from crying...
If Mayor Debozo was as strict on gun crimes and gang violence as he is with COVID restrictions, NYC might become liveable agian. But, it's good see police doing police work for once instead standing at the entrance of a BJ's dept store.. Unfortunately, the DA will likely press for lesser sentencing for the majority of these losers and the Judge will grant bail. Instead of deportation and 20 years mandatory. Defund the police, blm, with social workers and reactional basketball courts in afternoon school programs will save the world. Nope!
But these are the same ones shooting up the streets and they've been cops but when you say it your crazy. It's been happening the entire BLM era
TAKE THE TRACH OUT.
MAKE NEW YORK CITY GREAT AGAIN DONALD J TRUMP 🇺🇸🇮🇱🇺🇲👌
Wow. All those cops and they didn’t shoot one innocent person? That’s something to be celebrated. 16 arrests. I bet only 3 people will actually be prosecuted and convicted. They gotta make it sound good though!
RICO TIME !!!!
WHAT YOU GOING TO DO WHEN THEY COME FOR YOU 🇺🇲
Hope they are locked up for years and not a few hours... Disgusting!!!
I wonder if any celebrities will post their bail.
OMG they will be locked up for days. Otherwise the outcome of prison population will be racist.
All right.
I bet many are citizens of the Dominican Republic. They will eventually kick them out of the country.
As a minority we shouldn't be committing genocide in our own community's it's wrong,selling drugs is wrong period,whats disturbing is how people glorify police work on a small pond with small fish when the big ocean of fish is supplying these less fortunate NEABORHOODS and watching the destruction go on while there pockets are getting fat,politicians,cops,you name itt are turning thee other cheek,for years this has been going on,if thee authority really wants to stop the madness along with the civilians,then why not March and protest on the company's that are makeing guns,how is it that all these guns mysteriously make it to these less fortunate communitys,isn't it odd that you don't here a peep of any gold bars from fort Knox missing,and also with all this technology on hand how is it that all these drugs make it into America,as long as you have corruption in high places there will allways unfortunately be drugs in the streets to sell.💯
It seem like they should have been doing this last year when the last guy was in office was talking about cleaning up the streets but now they want to do it before this election that's coming up 🤔 you better not fall for the okie dokie.. they clean the streets y'all need to clean house
Wait was that a kid in purple trying to stop the man from shooting someone
Keep voting democrat and this is what you'll keep getting
They have to if they want to save NY
1000s more to go
Great put the cockroaches in jail better  yet put them in Rahway State Prison and do not let them out
Well done officer now don’t let them out!
Sterilization.
Thank you po po
Take down the guns by the buy back  and stop the being so lenient on the way you give them rewards so they can't trade in   these to get more gun s or more powerful gun s  or something worse  Texas   Mexico and these countries that makes these weapon s are making money off  our young and  our  economy and wasting my taxes to kill each other
Who the fuck out here snitching🤣😂
Looks to me like a publicity stunt.
Don’t worry the mayor will let them out in no time cuz COVID & the unsafe conditions in Rikers, which the mayor is ignoring
Every single news outlets continues to speak on taking down all these gangs! Now not one single white supremacy news outlet talks about taking down white supremacy! White supremacy is the biggest gang in the world!💪🏾🏋🏿‍♂️🤔🤔
So when are the people in the United States going to grow acfreaking backbone and just start executing these people for just being part of a gang?
God forbids they solve all crime, the whole system would crumble
There is good& bad wherever you go. But, to be honest I am very glad I left New York!
Do not think this makes you Governor quality you know whom.
Europeanz politicians Throw parties for name brand stuff ..okay ..so
Awesome
They not gonna do shit to them but free them 🤦🏽‍♂️
THEY TOOK THE ITALIAN MOB DOWN WHAT MAKES THEM THINK THEYRE UNTOUCHABLE….HISTORY REPEATING ITS SELF!!
Let's start asking the questions as to who is selling these illegal guns? ATF knows where they're coming from and how they are getting in their hands. Violence is the symptom of a much larger problem.
*The LORD has made me see another day and I am lovingly here to remind the body of Christ to remain steadfast in Christ. May we all keep preparing for our LORD to come translate(rapture) us to Himself. We need to remind lukewarm believers daily to turn back from iniquity. We need to tell everyone that Yahushua Jesus is LORD! I  will shout this everywhere and everyday because I do not want blood on my hands. May God have mercy on the world.😭Jesus doesn't want anyone to perish. He loves the inhabitants of the world so much that He sent me to open a YouTube channel to warn His friends ❤️ I am unworthy but I am His servant and He is my Master. Seek ADONAI now more than ever!! Repent!! MARANATHA 🔥✝️ Tell the whole world about His return. Be an end time lighthouse and shofar! Shalom.🔥🙏🏻🛐✝️🕊️🕎*
Set an example, give them all 10 years flat!!
On the GANG!!!
Violates people rights with no search Warrants ..how illegal
Why do they stupid stuff like this ?for what so they can’t be on top for a short time…work hard like everyone else does,now they all r going to get deported back to Dominican Republic with no money there goes the American dream!!!!!morons!!!!
Good job NYPD 👏
I dont even know these people did anything wrong
👏👏
Keep the in jail now or deport them to Afghanistan.
Di blasio is a joke..they'll be out in a few days.
And tomorrow they will all be on our streets again  partying and dancing because new york sucks big time,thanks to the laws we have,wreaking havoc and chaos is ok,matters well legalize the Purge
Bless them Officers, they work their ass off. May they all be safe🙏❤
Now convict them and then take them out into the back of the courthouse and let the jury machine gun THEM to death.
They will be replaced by others as we are sharing our comments now.
Free them
The ones in Tampa work with the police corrupt as hell here
NYC what a craphole city,why would anyone live there,matter of fact most US cities are terrible...live rural people and stay safe
You didn't get rid of the bullies in Tampa they are working with the police cricket as hell
Unfortunately get ready for more violence as gang territories are now available
Take out one, another steps in it's place. Take out ten, ten more step up. The government loves these gangs because it keeps them employed.
Including crack.. 😆
Damn these tanned white supremacists that joe Biden and CNN warned us about 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Great police work!!
nyc has very tough and restrictive gun control laws… how is it that this gang is able to keep getting their hands on guns. hmmm those those gun control laws don’t seem to be doing what they are supposed to be doing.
Free the guys
They are probably out on bail before this airing
Well they wanted to defund the police.........here you go. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Send in our military! We have them home for a reason bc our own country is at war with itself.
Send them to North Korea. They will be taught what real gang is about.
arrested to be let out again with a slap on the wrist if even that.
Dominican 🇩🇴
Now come downtown where another uptown Dominican gang  also operates;, Dominicans Don't Play (dumb-ass name).  I guess they have to start murdering people before NYPD takes notice; that has been SOP since Bloomberg.
Lol did she call it the Bandemic?? Lol 🍾💯💪🏾🤑
Id like to know how quickly theyll be getting out thanks to the flawed justice system.  And im not talking about bailing out
NYC ain't playn
We will be lucky if even one of them has a conviction that sticks.
over "turf" that they never paid a dime for🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Bigger gang used connections to send them in jail  Big fishes are eating small fishes
LMAO! They knew what was coming. There’s a dirty D.A up to NYPD to investigate. 8 years later 🗣
Execute them all.
Showing undercover officers faces is careless ams disrespectful to those that serve us. Give them there privacy and let them do there job,  don't put them at any risk.
No racist comments for the latinx huh? Lol interesting....
3 years watching this gang they are looking at serious time but don't worry family or not somebody is going to snitch because when you looking at the next 25 to 50 years in prison you will be singing like the temptations lol.
They didnt have to follow any laws at the boarder, Why you harrassing them now? Man!
Trinitarios still running strong. This ain't done shhhh!! Give a year for the heat to die down.. ⏳👀👀👀
Good job. I hope they throw away the cell  key
Want to make aure your operation keeps profiting?.  Dont go assaulting in broad daylight with FUKN GUNS!!!!!
This is the result of ther rap music... it just encourages and glamorized the whole gang scean... here's the big payoff kids...
I saw a lot of future doctors, scientists and role models arrested. A slap on the wrist and back at it tomorrow.
Nice fallen shirt ! And yes it takes work from 2018 so they can get out in a few days /months :(
White people are confused on how to be racist with this one in the comments. 👀👀😳 😂😂😂
TRUE HEROES!
Lol Where all them lebron and BLM comments!! Y’all quite when they not Black that’s crazy!
NYPD BIGGEST GANG IN AMERICA. GET AWAY WITH IT CUZ THEY CAN
Looks like they're going to camp, what a joke!
Thanks Honorable Mayor for his good wish...
Should've called ICE .. deportation...
After 2 years of the media and politicians telling us that the most dangerous threat to America is "violent white supremacists", it's good to see that the police are finally rounding some of them up, and getting them off the streets. Hopefully, with these "white supremacists" in custody, our streets will be a little safer now...
The cops were so nice to them. I wonder why, these violent criminals were treated so well, their during arrest?🤔
Like violence? Vote Democrat!
And the biggest focus of rhetoric we hear today is how we can eliminate white privilege on all Americans
Very soon people will campaign for their freedom
Just stake out apartment complexes. Wannabe gangsters living with momma.
There ass in jail
Disgusting and disgraceful! This evil is being past down to generations. SMH 🤦🏽‍♀️
💚🇩🇴🇩🇴🇵🇷
They will be out in 24 hours all they get is a slap 👋 in the hands😎
Put them under the jail
Good work now I hope they get the perpetrators of the covid , these are just leaves and branches let cut down the tree, dig up the roots but I know this looks good for TV
That diamond pendant not 200K 🤣🤣she think that’s Soulja boy jewelry 🤣🤣
What a disgrace on the NYPD, one of their own wearing a Red Sox tee.....good job on the takedown, though.
Why didn’t they start in the government first
Don't even put them in American jail cells, it would be to comfortable for them,,put them in s comumist nation jail. Work out a deal to ship them there!
It's a Family business with actual Jobs.  When they are Released on "No Bail" they can file for unemployment and rental assistance.
Great job officers, now lets see what the courts do????
Why does, Brother have to carry the heaviest bag.  Damn!
🔫🔫🗽 HISPANICS LIVES MATTER 🗽🔫🔫🚔😨😨
Good job indeed...
Open borders = Drugs n Crime 😆
Bail reform…. Doucheblasio will let them free within a week or so.
I wonder who is going to take down the criminals who started and continued the fing Afganistan war.....??? Bush, Obama, Trump....
Lovely dainty women  gang members are lazy  typical
Not likely going to catch em all , they're going to go underground, they're not stupid enough to continue their activities with law enforcement heat on them
Gangs are terrorists. How many people do white militiamen kill each weekend?

Damn someone dropped the ball in that gang talk about being a disappointment
And this is why I'm moving out of NY. It's really disgusting it's sad because I was born and rised in NY with all these Gangs and  High violence in the subways has made New York so unsafe to live. There has been an Exodus of 100,000  people that have moved out the City they say will never come back because of the  Violence and real estate.
Take down the kkk arrest your self
Y arrest....they will just get released
How ? I thought gun control works !!!!!! Fire the mayor
Everyone is entitled to due process. Why can’t we prosecute the unofficial gangs in the suburbs and upper middle class neighborhoods. I’m tired of seeing low level dealers and poor people paraded on camera as public enemy number one while these types of crimes and more go unpunished in other parts of the city. How is it that a politician can break the law in full view of the public and not so much as get a citation from law enforcement. The system has a sever lack of integrity.
Get money and fall back. It's enough money for everybody... Welp in this game, you've failed the mission 🤝🏼✌🏼
Varsity Midnight Joggers from Sharpton University. Repeats from the same tribe/hood - yet the media says beware of the MAGA hat!!! Burn Loot Murder De Blasio - LIBERAL DEMOCRAT FAILURE!!!!
Dumb-members! 👿
it's all for show. they will all be out shortly
$#$# FBI
CONGRATULATIONS to these policemen,  well done, officers!  Bless you.  Stay safe out there!
I'm happy cause they ain't shit
They locked up 20 ppl, put outdated purses, a few grand and a nonsense jewelry appraisal in the air and say mfs had a empire. 🤦🏿‍♂️😭 a damn empire….😂 u can’t make this shit up, media ain’t shit.
🥜
Surprise BLM and Lebrono Jamie is not repeating their infamouse line "They be hunting us everyday".
There are more than a half 1, million cartel members in New York and you just start doing this now you are such a piece of shit for a mayor
a little good here and there doesn't fix the families illegally broken by corrupt authorities
Curtis Sliwa for Major clean it up baby!! NO BAIL!!
many of the authorities will not ever get any respect from those who had their families illegally targeted & destroyed by corrupt police & corrupt courts. until the wrongs are fixed, it is clear that all corrupt authorities have declared WAR on the family unit publicly with their actions alone......
They were probably all released in 2 hours .
Sad to say but nypd is wasting their time.  The boso mayor and the DA are going to find a way to have them released
Yeah gangsters and fat females who want to be accepted instead of eating healthy they do what ever the dumb so called gangs want pathetic everyone

Thanks Biden
after 7 years of letting the drug dealers, and thugs run the city, Mayor Deblasio is finally letting the police do their job. Now if he could make sure the Judges, and prosecutors keep these scumbags in jail that may help the people of this city feel better.
Nice work Men in Blue!
Send them back to the countries they come from if not America 🙄
Look at all these white supremacists.
See nothing but worthless losers being arrested, good job PD 👏 👍
Go Blue you’re the best!
Just let all the criminals free. America doesn't care about America any longer!
Great work.  That scumbag mayor of New York will probably let them go tomorrow with the key to the city
69 keep taking people down...
NYC,  don't bullshit, when it comes to Gangs and Rico laws. Chicago be like, if the victims are opps, who cares.
Why arrest them they care about no ones life
They’ll be back out again or get stronger making connections with other inmates oh well
real life The Wire
I m not playing I m from the south now I will ☠these fucking gang bastards no arrest
Fuck em
They’re off the streets until next week
CORRUPTION OF CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS MAYOR OFFICES GOVERNOR AND STATE REPRESENTATIVES WHO HAVE COMMON INTEREST IN MONEY. THIS IS A PUBLICITY STUNT FOR MEDIA NEWS.  AFTERWARDS IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL.  MORE GANG MEMBERS DRUGS AND MONEY.  THESE GANG MEMBERS DIDN'T MAKE THE PAYMENT PLAN. AND GOT RAIDED
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 for each of them!!!
Their democratic leadership will have them out by end of day on no bond.
Bravo 👏🏽
More of this and less political theater painting bullshit on a fkn road.
9/11 MEANS NOTHING TO THE PEOPLE OF NYC
Get um!!!!😡😡😡
The system is broken, if theirs no criminals theirs no fear or cheap labor. The higher ups feed of fear.
COLOR ?????
Sad but true 20 more will take their place for the fast money.
Thank you, New York's FINEST!!!
They should come to pick up the ones on my street next
🤔🤔🤔
I bet in 6 months with all the resources they have I'll take down all the street gangs and go after the big boys but of course it's all about money, war and profits.
Wait a minute something doesn't add up here. Biden keeps telling us that "white supremacist's are the biggest domestic threat to America" but all I keep seeing is the usual suspects killing, robbing, and terrorizing America night after night. Hmmm??
at least these gangs didn't try and take over our government like Q Anon and Republicans
Tribu gang💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
Chicago needs to take note!! Good job NY!!!
I thought the Democrats got rid of all the cops in NYC...
Grandfathers mother’s and sons
Looking all sheepish. Ain't too tough in handcuffs.
BLM..........Bidens Lowlife Minions
****Yawn****
“And pix 11 was the only camera thereeeee” man they feel cool.
From the video it looks like the lady in cuff's is wearing a purple jacket trying to stop the gun man from shooting into the crowd. Watch closely 🙄
Gang members should be executed,all of them they are obsolete to the future of society.
thas wassup hate them spaniard gang members they hit my car with a wrench because i was mad that a meter maid gave me a parking ticket while i was in my car!
Now Deblasio wants the Credit. Please!
It’s easy in New York because they have so many people there and the diversity that people love so much in New York is one of the reasons along with being a sanctuary city.
Don't worry, they'll be back on the streets in no time
nothing to see here, they will be replaced by another group in a week
It's about time.
Good job officers..,get those demons off the street and in a cell!!
Let’s hope the DA and judges keep them in prison.
And they all walk free in a few days.  I don't believe our legal system cares about keeping the public safe.
Free all my popote 💚🍍
They all have one thing in common.......Guess??
Get them and their families out of nyc
Well... none of these police are undercover after this stupid news crew.  🙄  should have blurred faces.. idiots
Drugs will always bring gun violence, plain and simple
Who wants thug's for grandparents?, Dealing drug's, Fighting and Killing. SMH
Lock these thugs up for life no doubt. Give them all the highest bond ever. Now let's get more!
Y'all caught this what about the police doing sex trafficking 😥
Blue lives matter
I wouldn't say:"Gang members shooting other gang members" is "Unfortunate"
Man stop wasting time, go to BK and get those dudes.... But Good Job NYPD.
And NY politicians will have these convicts back out on the streets in a few hours with Mets tickets 🎫. Also, the same neighborhood they terrorize are the ones who protest on their behalf 🤷🏽‍♂️
Welcome to defund pilice NYC
Good job thank you 😊
Hang them all. Problem solved.
Is a shame trinitarios are a group that protects them self and others against anyone.... but since someone got permission to lead trinitarios in the street this is what is happening...
God bless the blue
Dang just showed everyone's faces, tactics and license plates.. sheesh..
Damn
This is the police work I like to see
Praying that this will save many innocent lives!
Who are the real Bad Gang And Terrorist Of NY? If You Say The NYPD ( New York Pig Department) Your Absolutely Right. They Kill And Terrorizes Innocent People Not To Mention Have A  Racist Culture Towards Blacks And Brown For A Very Long Time. Their Entire Fabric Is Woven Into Racism. Yes They Take Down These Gang Members While White Supremacists Rules And Top Their Ranks. Clean Your House First Before You Can Clean The Streets! You House Is Stink Of Corruption And Racism!
They should drop them off in Portland Oregon for treatment
They’ll be out in a few hours with a desk appearance ticket Yea the cops bringing them in but the judges will let them right back out
Show their faces, publish their names. They have no need to be protected.
Sure wish they would put this kind of effort in cracking down on what’s really destroying America: white collar crime and corruption
Nicole Johnson is a prick, and the government its behind all this.
AOC and the squirts will bail them out
They'll all be out by halloween. Trick or trinatarios! 🎃
Can we bring back hangings???? That will AT LEAST put the message out that if you murder YOU will be put to death in the MOST horrible way. 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
What happens when they are on the DA's hands.. Democrats wants them to be release..Dont press charges on them because they do it because they want bread (as per AOC)..plus the major and everyone else wants to demolish the NYPD.. They want less police..
bout damn time; they think the US is soft! End migration.
Mexican culture in America, thank Biden and keep voting Demo!!!
Those are HUD building where so called poor people were getting help with housing on 135 street…they get those apartments and harbor drug dealers. It’s been going on over there for sooooo long…I’m talking decades
The judge will just let them go
Grandfathers, Grandmothers Fathers, Mothers, Sons & Daughters....The Epitomy of A SAVAGE LIFE CYCLE. Then they got damn nerve blaming N.Y.P.D. for their downfall. 💀
Deport...
EXCELLENT WORK NYPD ! Keep it going, and keep them off the street! Rico all of them!
Thank you Chicago do the same what are you waiting for
Be right back out in 48hrs on house arrest with no one is checking if they are not running the streets still doing crimes.
Kill them all and never to exclude Corruptos democratas Law Enforcement... All🤮 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
Hahahahaha got busted chicken head
All Worthless people, willingly worthless 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
Do society a favor by lining them up in front of a firing squad.
Cleaning up Riverdale. These thugs use good neighborhoods to hide. Glad the NYPD got them
Thank goodness for the brave men and women that got them off the streets. Now dump them way out in the ocean.
I bet most of these people will be released on SR bonds by libral prosecutors and judges. Because, "how dare you assume these BIPOC offenders are criminals". Fuck your witness testamonies, physical and circumstantail evidence. You are a BIGOT if you call these people criminals.
We need 50 100 foot cells in isolation     Little boys being  big men   so ignorant  why don't they shoot each other's The "! N" WORD 2021 .
Joes kids at play. Usa is a filthy ghetto
Small fries.
Ladies and Gentlemen, your proud BLM Gang Members.
joes kids🤣
as you stop 16 , you got thousands , just waiting.  Go figure!
White supremacy is the most dangerous thing facing the US.
No bonds!!!
How did the drugs get into the U.S
I don’t see Mexicans lol I thought they were gang members
Stfu debozo / your bail reform will let them out .. and they will be gone
Propaganda
Gun Play …. Hah
No longer the big Apple.  But the Big Asshole..
How the hell did they get guns in NYC??
These racist, violent Trump supporters keep getting darker I’m tell you
When are they gonna arrest the government officials that these low lifes work for?? That would put a stop to gangs in the country.
Ok... they've been arrested... Great!.... Now.... "bail" needs to be.... SKY HIGH! 😠  (However... preferably... "Bail Denied")  Enough of this... "catch & release" BULLSH*T!... We're NOT running a "Trout Farm" here in NYC!
I personally think they should die behind bars. I don't give a fuck what happens to them behind bars. Don't let them see light of day
blm hard at work
They should clear ALL these gangs from the streets!!!
Defund the police! Defund the NYPD! How's that defunding thing working out for you now?
🥊🥊🥊😂😂😂😂 in joy the Quick chill and Turkey à la King
A lot of these gang members are not from this country , please send them back for definatly back without having them come back .
Don’t steal The government hates competition!!
In Harlem. This is why I bought body armor. Who's the bastard of a politician who thought there should be no private ownership of body armor in New York earlier this year?
Thank God
Angelic vterroris Females. FEMINIST ?
Is that young ma??
The suspects were arrested, booked and released upon completing their sentences.
Good job nypd
16 people lol take down 100s then you got something. Smh
"off the streets?"  They will be out in short order.
I’m Chicago and we never see people being handcuffed and justice being served. We just hear about shootings with no arrests
Those free payments have stopped gotta keep the cash flowing.
Shameful they have nothing better to do.great work NYPD
They will be back on the street before this time next year… Sad but true
The NYPD is still failing to arrest their Officers whom are in fact Gang Leaders....
"This gang has a legacy of lawlessness".  Really?. I thought gangs did charity work
I hate China and North Korea, but at least they dont have this problem because they send people like these to camps, maybe we should do the same?
idiots spent all that drug money on dumb sh!t. i never hear about idiots like these spending their drug money on property and businesses. Stringer Bell tried to tell you fools on the Wire. later for all that run and gun bullish!t. Buy for a dollar sell for two.
Ain't no innocents on that fuxking street
Hey de blasio, elections coming man 😃
Would be better if they track the manufacture plant .
Not true Mayor the crime rate last month didn’t go down.lol
chop the hands and feet off of these vultures.
Start chopping off some hands, public beatings and these thugs will get in line .... The Taliban knows how ...we can learn at least that from them ...
note to gang members: keep your bribe payments current to the mayor.
Sad - only 16?
Thank You. Keep these thugs off the streets. Let our kids live

Bro nigga said because of turfs Forreal 🤦🏿‍♂️
Good job! I hope they did it the right way and followed the law so these criminals don't get off
Fuck all you cowards in gangs, go to war and kick down doors in Afghanistan for your country no be grateful for the liberty the country gives you fake tough guys. Fucking cowards. How dare you bitches kill kids. You sick fucks
This is what i like to see.. now throw them in the ocean.
Give the Mayor his credit!
there are rich people living in Riverdale, around Riverdale is one richest neighborhoods only  in the borough of the Bronx  without counting the other boroughs in NYC,  in the town of Riverdale is on the same side and route of west side Manhattan  and alot of people including the authorities know that
The click bait lead could mean gang of drug-dealing police in the NYPD were taken down.  Anyone old enough to remember Serpico will realize that is not at all far-fetched.
Lmao let's see how tough they are now!
Good Riddance. Enjoy Rikers
Good for them
damn thats good prada shirt why they put it on blast like that
These people come from countries that allow this shit to go on unchecked. But according to our politicians, these are our future doctors and lawyers and inventors. Lets be honest, there's no cash bond, they aren't behind bars, they were walked through, booked and released.
Issues #1 gun control didnt prevent criminals carry guns and didn’t made criminals follow the law Issues #2 they will bail out ASAP  Issues #3 repeat
3 years for 16 members,,
Can’t blame this on black people where are those lebron James comments?
I wish there was a private organization of about 300 million people that can investigate the government and all government agencies for bringing drugs in by the boat tons. We the people should be able to judge jury and execute the same individuals who appoint themselves these positions in doing so to the american public. Fuck the system.  It's a fucking joke. The descendants of slave owners reaping the benefits of their forefathers who committed unspeakable acts to "build" this nation. Fuck em all.
Lock them up. But then Biden and Harris will bail them out
Yes let the junkies.  Shiver tonight
And…………. Their free…
Hang Em All
So wait a minute. They’ve been investigating for 3 years and only got 16 people??! 🤦🏽‍♀️
Doesnt nyc have strict gun laws that make law abiding citizens victims?
Damn a lot of those undercover police officers look good af
They should never see light of day...and judges and d.a. should follow
The left will say the cops are racist and targeting people of color.
Theyll be out in ten minutes
GOOD TO SEE NYPD CLEANING UP THE DOGSHIT!!!
Defund the Police se we can have a crime wave.  I nominate the police from Rio de Janeiro.  A** whoopings coming.
Good for to the NYPD finally they makes sense of their work.
Who gives a fuck about Harlem???
Behind bars for how long? 24 hours?
Couldnt they run faster if they didnt have to hold their pants up?
illegals?!?!!!
Lovely E.  They're watching and waiting
Siri play Jail by Kanye West😂🤷🏾‍♂️
BRING BACK STOP AND FRISK ....... WHETHER THE BLACKS AND LATINOS HOODS LIKE IT OR NOT
"We be shootin' innocent citizens erry day!" LeBLM James.
All that In part to REfund the police department,good job boys in blue 👮🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👍
Bye! Good job NYPD! Give them all the amenities legally allowed…. Just keep them off the streets!
lmao that pendant was middle of the mall shit.
Investigation been going on since 2018 ? How many people have been killed in all that time..?so whose accountable for those deaths and injuries and unnecessary damages ect? Sure needs to be more then just those in this arrest. Where's the ones who kept watching and knowingly letting them out and get away with things. That's so disturbingly disgusting thinking all that everyone was allowed to be purposely forced to surfer, indore and sacrifice threw, and all while now pats on the back are wanted now for these arrests. How much Justice is in all that. And it goes on all over the place, need to do so much better then this and better then allowing to go on so long . so sadly wrong
Father, mothers, sons,  daughters, grandparents  and neighbors. Basically a small part of "the community ". Who had legit money making schemes as well as illegal. How many Christians and Muslims? Haaaa?!
THANK YOU NYPD!!
Yes let’s just fkn announce we’re coming for you! I’m sure they’ll put out the welcome mat and patiently awaiting your arrival. Tf? Move in silence and catch em sleep.. they been fkn sh** up forever and fearing no repercussions..
kamala will post thier bail
Naw you got it all wrong , they are good boys just on their way to church. It’s a simple case of mistaken identity
16 huh? Sooooo, that leaves what? About 250,000 left!? LOL!!!
"Washington (CNN)White supremacists will remain the most "persistent and lethal threat" in the United States through 2021, according to Department of Homeland Security draft documents. "
Jail for life!!!!!
The Entire Human Race needs to Repent before God
No thanks to da Mayor Bet they all voted for him, twice.
I'm sure this is a mistake.  This manpower is needed for checking vaccine passports in restaurants.  Oh!  The humanity!
All those cops are racist for arresting those hard working folks. 🤣😂
They need to use the “race card”
Wtf? Investigating that long? Damn. Good luck on busting them again. They'll be released.
What's the point They'll be released tomorrow.
Get a job..so easy
will they be set free ??
We need the death 💀 penalty in every state …. Death for all let’s do some cleaning 🧼 🇺🇸
Latinos and black
Gangster's
Keep it coming they don't deserve to be out in the street hard-working families are leaving New York because of people like this
Wow.  Great job guys.  Now we have to work on the gangs in the police department 😁
The Bronx most buggin borough in ny right now
They will get released
Good job !
I wonder how many "innocent people" who were running and demand justice will be coming forward as an eyewitness. Still going with I didn't see anything". Good for the officers, but probably with no help from the community, but let's have vigils and marches to make it look like you care.
Good job as usual NYPD!! bad boys, bad boys what you're going to do when they come for you?.... because, they will
Great job. By the officers
Glad arrests were made, hoping they result in lengthy jail terms. Hoping Bx residents continue to stay safe with the Power Vacuum created as an unfortunate result.
Well, crime is wrong it just is. But this sheep talk Is killing me. Well let’s deal with it. In the last 100 years give or take, your grandparents came here as Irish, Jewish, Italian, a few more! This is where you come from. Let’s study history people. A&E did a special called American justice on it. Watch it and let it get you thinking. They were technically the first black people. Systematically the same treatment until they were upgraded to American white, but only because the war  coming soldiers were needed and blacks were freed and growing financially. In a nutshell Jews were given civil service, Italians construction, Irish law enforcement. These people here are gonna get the Rico law. Yes crime is wrong but y’all loooooove conviction without the Y. Just check it out. This nice life a lot of people have came from a criminal not that long ago
Let’s go nypd, clean the streets. Keep the energy going.
Wow
What happened to the guy dragged into the car???
AOC will be protesting their arrest.  It’s racists to target them.
Now if only Chicago would learn it’s the gangs not the guns but then again beetlejuice likes chaos and confusion then blame it on racism.
Felicitó a ..NYPD...thes Best.!!
I bet none of them speak English. Deport them today
Yet the BLM thinks the police are the problem!
The white man's fault for sure, white privileges fault, and the topper is white supremacy. But hey camel harris and her bail reform crew will help these marginalized folks out.
Good..!!!
Deblasio runs the drugs keep away from his profit.
Why isn't the Sickler family going to jail?
I'm surprised deblasio didn't insist on using airsoft guns and social workers
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
How come they didn't shoot? Oh that's right, they'd get shot back..and police are still being held back or worse- afraid to do their jobs and bring this sort to justice or worse they only took the job for the pay and avoid doing their duty.
What about Dr. Fauuccii and his gang?  Lying to congress and using millions  in tax payer money for R & D gain of function? Killing many..Total media blackout.
#Dems must be mad Good job #DefendThePolice
Yo them undercops could blend in really good in the hood wow and probably walked by them a million times on Broadway too.
Send them all to Afghanistan
Great news!  Now make sure the DA doesn't drop or plead down the gun charges!  Use ALL the laws on the books to effectively sentence these suspects.
Does anyone know if the trinitarios go to war with ms13 or latin kings?
Should’ve bought Bitcoin instead!
Unfortunately as soon as you take down one group 20 more pop up worst than the first.
Get rid of nycha
Thank you to the police men and police lady who made this happen. We need more police in NY.
Democrat Party base voters.
All brought to you by the Biden Administration. They arrested gang members after Cuomo resigned as if the governor and the gangs were somehow linked together.
The Broadway Bullies gang is being taken out of Riverdale by “ Archie, Reggie, Moose, Chuck, Dilton, Jughead and Hot Dog”. Oh; and also by the NYPD.
"And Pix 11 is the only camera there" snitch ass
250,000 more to go.
These are small time felons!!! All you people are slow because they are not catching the guys who are selling them the guns and drugs!!! Yall sound smart to a fool but its just going to be more small guys to take over where these left off. The police need to stop them from buying illegal guns online and drugs online if they don't its millions of kids that will just pick up where these small time crooks left off.
Inaccurate information against hardworking Biden supporters defund the police impeach Trump
Like LaBron Said "We Out Here Hunting Everyday! #Accountibilty
All you people are silly because they are not catching the guys who are selling them the guns and drugs!!! Yell sound smart to a fool but its just going to be more small guys to take over where these left off. The police need to stop them from buying illegal guns online and drugs online if they don't its millions of kids that will just pick up where these small time crooks left off.
Great job Nypd.
Hoodie off please
Anymore crime issues from gang members , between now and November , will cost Eric Adams the election. People of NYC will swing their vote towards Curtis Sliwa. The Mayor of NYC.
Police cant do nothing. Duh!
I used to live in Manhattan I now live in Massachusetts and it's sad to say that the Massachusetts police could learn a lesson at you from these cops regarding the gangs here God bless these cops and the hard work that they do.
Same ol joses
Grandfather, damn!
Outstanding! Way to go. True heroes. Back the blue!
When are we going to lock up Cuomo
Good job for all the police, now let’s hope the Judges don’t let them walk.
Start deporting them
Life time for all of them
The thing is that this Gang members will be out in a month
Deport them all!
Southeast Asia to America: Let us show you how we handle drug smugglers
Yawn. What about the other, more serious NY criminal organization .... The Trump Organization?
Yeah like this is going to stop any damn thing. Tell me you’re stopping crime when you finally stop that boat from docking at the damn port and then NYPD can finally say they did something. Otherwise you just cleared the way for the next struggling person to set up shop at the same spot. This is like celebrating patchwork on pot holes in a city of creates
Good
✊🏿
They will be out tomorrow
Thank you for your service folks
Come through now with the LeIdiot comments now please
Just like The Wire
This what Chicago needs..asap
Gangsters locking up gangsters.
This was posted a few hours ago. Are they out yet?
why were the women cuffed but not the guys
This strong police presence is triggering me. Why not just bring the social workers in to baby talk the gang murderers so that we can all be friends. BLM 😂
hoodies dont even show their face.
"This isnt a gang! They are members of the Boys and Girls Club brought together by the community to interact with one another while working harmoniously to generate monies by selling candy bars and lemonade. Your honor, to put these outstanding examples of our community behind bars would be a travesty!" I should have been a lawyer. Lol
In this particular culture its honorable to be a criminal. Who the hell wants to live in that type of society? Why do people create laws to defend criminals?
DEFUND THEPOLICE!!! these thugs need a chance to be succesful and above all, lots of therapy!!! SARCASM only..
GREAT JOB OFFICER'S Y'ALL HAVE MUCH MORE TO DO! HOPE MANY STATES FOLLOW SUIT. BE SAFE🥇
Bow to Jesus Christ you time is running out
They weren't there because the cops tipped them off. They are the real rulers because the cops are dirty.
No, it goes on, because YOU DO NOTHING TO STOP THEM!
Damnit who’s gonna be the future doctors now?!? 🤔
Democrats doing their best to keep the rent low and the local districts blue with their special ingredients: “spice and chocolate.”
FED TIME!!!! 😳
These tough guys don't seem to like Being recognised when they get arrested. Not so tough now.
We need the death penalty. Point blank.
They will all be out and doing business again, in less than 24 hours!
That’s a box of chocolates
Good riddance. Bye! 💃🏿
i take it these were not  nato drugs
People still do crack??!?! Bruh 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️. Crack thou?? Jesus I gotta get out ny. It’s 2021 grow up
Here comes Kamala Harris with her bail out funding for these criminals.
They will be back on the streets in 24 hours
Straight from south of the border. Deport them.
Book'em Danno.... then let'em all go.
They out yet?
Just kill all of them...game over.. Just like taking the trash out..
They got desk appearance tickets and were released.
Be nice if you followed up and document the charges, court dates and punishments.
Don't worry they'll be back out. Gotta keep the shootings in NYC going, right?
I wonder if the nypd goes harder for fook boys at wall at.
Now they are sweeping up Harlem because the people gentrifying the place are complaining. it's hell in Harlem no matter how many white people move there!!
Every thing for the gram has caught up to them.

Hey I thought guns were illegal in NY? Good thing you can't get weapons from the streets .go Biden
Send em all back to their country of origin after a couple very large, hostile cops "tune em up" with some old school billy clubs....break both their spirits and their bones....
They’ll be out in an hour!! Keep electing democrats!!!
Good! I hope they never get out
It's nice to see so many vaccinated
If the system was fair for minorities... THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN
They’ll be back in the streets before the police finish their paperwork
he'll let them out within a week
Put an end to illegal entry on the border, strangles the entry of drugs. End of gangs, simple solution. Politicians don’t give an “F”, truth of the matter.
If the "elites" want to thin out the population, why not start with violent criminal gangs like this?
I wish they would do this in Chicago more often
Good job, now keep them locked up.
People still do the crack ? 🤔
That's so sweet of the NYPD to let them cover up with the hoodies...so thougtful...just like France with terrorists.
Keep on bringing them in!! Open borders!! Lax immigration laws!! Yayyyyy
That the mayor that emptied the prisons and said we are safer for it?
The women should have been riding d*** instead of following d****
How come they cant bust the real military heroin smugglers?,because they sillies
The game never changes only the players they'll b replaced SMH
Listen, I noticed these gangmembers all wear masks. That shows they are really good people. The NYPD should be cracking down on real criminals aka the unmasked/unvaccinated.
BLM? The "b" standing for any shade of brown.  Yet another case of the melanin enriched class reverting to their roots of hunting everyday with the intent of hobbling anyone wearing jogging shoes, high tops.
What a waste of time and money.  Harris and the entire libtard crew have a slush fund for bail being used by career criminals. They will be out soon doing it again. Thanks Joe
Where they taking them Rikers where they may end up dead due to lack of supervision. What a city I'll tell ya.
un employed
When will the gang known as the fraudulent government be taken DOWN? Enough is Enough on them!
Who snitches first is the big question? My guess, whomever was married in
about time
biz as usual.... does not change the flow of drugs   its the feds job at the borders  and ports to stop
Great job but will the changes stick? Will they just be released in a month or two?
Well done 😎
Good job NYPD
Geez, I hope nothing happens to the perps while in custody.
Arrest today release tomorrow
Good I'm tired of them dream killers
I don’t think 4 small stacks of hundreds would qualify as an “Empire!”
We'll here it's racist like math and voter ID 💩
Looks like great work to mr
Good. Now the courts need to do their job by KEEPING THEM LOCKED UP!!
Too bad most of them are going to be free in less than a week. Then more resources are going to be spent to catch them again. Endless cycle
Its about time.   They must have been worried with all the vigilante talk lately amongst the neighborhood
They will be out by tonight
Good work NYPD let's hope the politicians don't let them go.
Good work.  NOW KEEP THEM LOCKED UP.  And don't blame their guns.  Blame criminals and  take them off the streets.
Yes put alllll those officers faces out there on the news after a huge gang arrest 😶
I BEEN SAID DENOUNCE ALL GANGS OR YOU WILL REGRET IT!!! MARK MY WORDS!!! I GUESS THEY ARE MARKING THEM NOW!!!🤣😂🤣
Thank you, NYPD for taking out the trash
They will be out in a week
Just pass a law titled "Snitching Easy", if your snitch leads to a big arrest with evidence then your financial debt and police record are wiped clean.
OMG--- Defund the Police. Quick!!! That's 16 Votes the Mayor needs to stay in power.
A rival gang works for the mayor.  They are feeding them arrest to keep operating!
Take them all off the street. And keep them off.
Yes…..this is what we want ….gang task force going after the gangs and not disrespecting and attacking regular ordinary citizens.  Do your job and respect the citizens. Peace
But....GUN LAWS....😱
Won't they just be set free in a few days like all these other criminals?
Good, get that trash off the street!!
Maybe Chicago can learn a thing or two.
GET ALL THE GANGS NEW YORK!!! TODAY THE CITY IS YOURS!! KEEP IT UP NYPD!!
Now yall want to hide your face
Off the streets for 3 hours. Then back out there with cashless bail. Stupid politicians. Ruining the greatest city in the world.
Haha! Was gonna ask if new York is full of scum, answered it for me
New York is such a shit show..  lol
200k for the pendant 😂. The 👮‍♂️ stay  lying that jawn like 20k
Hope they keep them in jail no bond!!!! They deserve death penalty for the drugs and killings they've committed!!! .
Always the same shade of can't type the color
You guys are awesome for exposing how disgusting the Trinitarios are, ever since Junior.
They should be back on the street soon enough!
De blazon helped? Wow that’s new
I wonder how many gang members we are currently importing.
Thank you for serving . Be careful . God bless you.
Obviously climate change is making them be criminals. They should all be at home in bed by tomorrow.
Take You NYPD For Getting These Scumbags Off The Streets 💪
Put them behind bars and mentally evaluated and treated before released as a positive productive member of the society.
The Broadway Bullies...Hahahaha!...it’s hard to believe these are full grown men
I seen this show before. It’s called The Wire.
Black Lives Matter 😂🤷‍♂️🤔
Who cares they'll all be out on bail tomorrow and gone with the wind.
They won't do much to them the court system it just sucks
Now that pendant ain’t worth no damn 200K … 🤔
Why are you being so nice to them?  They should be being beaten senseless while in custody...If this were Chyna, they'd be dragging the lifeless bodies into the paddy wagon.
Grandparent gang members? When the say "I'm a real O.G. " inside jail it's the truth.
NYPD KICKING A$& & TAKING NAMES!!!!
He was just trying to killing someone that wasn't not wearing the muzzle on. Order from Biden's policy  Love Q
Lol NYC having gang take down every other week
That's ironic......at 3:07, there's a gang member in the upper right corner throwing up gang signs while the man is speaking.
Bravo to you
Oh man now they got more criminals the Dems can free and pay for not doing crime.
Everyone there vaccinated?
More of these please!!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Bet they didn't see that coming. After the culture war the soldiers will be first to not have a place in Leftopia...
They have too much melanin to be locked up in NY. They'll be on the streets shortly thanks to those lovely Democrats.
No thanks to you deblasio.
Lol cover your face 🤣 😂 😆 wouldn't want ur mommy to see ur monster criminal face
All these guys are gonna rat.
No thanks to you deblasio.
Okay so what now they all get a fine and go home 🤦
Yaa, and California is giving them $300 to not commit gun crimes!  Can you say retarded politicians 🙄  🤣🤣🤣
What a bunch of chumps
Gang members?  These people are Ivy League scholars!  Leave them to their devices!
With Deblasio they will be back on the streets the next morning.
they provide the drugs then take them down after words . our law enforcement allow you to deal drugs. Fake kingpin i bet he was a plant from the start. Our goverment is so corrupt i cant trust anything i just stay out the way.
If only they can keep them locked up forever rather than just 5 minutes.
They should throw term right into the Hudson
Good deport all of them happy for the cops
You wonder why spray tan man left?
Cops getting rid of the competition for their other gang friends
You know the 🐷s took their cut
If meddling kids and a stoner dog are what foiled your criminal scheme, you probably weren't going to get away with it in the end anyways.
I understand the drug dealers were arrested but when there is demand there will be supply
The broadway bullies ........that's the name of a real gang ?
Thank you God , atleast you got the good cops doing the job that needs to be done a long time ago . Innocent people hard working people are getting killed because of these ass @#%* that have no work , and please send back the members to there own country ...
Mayor  Debozo  Always  sitting down like he do so much
16 arrested 16 let out with no bail.
Haha
Lets bring back public hangings.
the only gang members, should be dead gang members.
Lock them up and throw away the keys!
They will let over half of them back out with no bail and the other ones will get a cheap bail so they'll all be back out on the street within a month so why waste all this taxpayers money rounding all these thugs up just need to put them all in a bus drive it off a bridge into the river they're all worthless waste of space
They're just oppressed, show them some compassion
Life
Drop them in the ocean
don't be distracted folks it's only because of the midterms are approaching rapidly and then it's back to business as usual
that’s fake ass prada lol
Give them the death penalty😬!!!!!! 🇺🇸🦅🇺🇸👍
What about the NYPD themselves. There are many criminals there too
135st this has to be on the east side west side is not having that
I am shocked they aren't hailed as heroes and a statue is built in their names as good citizens!!
If you finna sell drugs you stay low and only target the jack boys. Not some gang shit. Stupid mofos. Play defense 80 percent offense 20 .
Biden’s told y’all he would put y’all in chains
They did this across the country at the same time ……ON THE SAME PLATE!!!!
Not a lot of diversity in that gang.
Young people what have you done with your lives?
What’s the name of this gang
13:53o clock
What happened to all the Cardi B videos?  Were they confiscated too?
Thousands of gangs in NY and they grabbed 16.    Lmao  What a joke to law enforcement  You guys need to hammer them hard All of them  Then you’ll find out who’s paying the $$$$$ to keep FBI an others off their scent
They will be out in 1 hour because of the Democrat policies
Oh well Dominicans

DONT MAKE THESE OFFICERS PUT THEIR LIFE ON THE LINE JUST FOR YOU PROSECUTORS TO NOT PROSECUTE.  THESE PPL NEED A LONG SENTENCE! NOW DO YOUR JOB!
Great job guys! I have been saying these criminals are too dumb to realize there is a sting operation going on and its only a matter of time before the cops come to round them up! While people were struggling these thugs took that opportunity to make life harder for everyone. Good riddance!
Excellent.  Great police work!
They should keep the cops ids undercover.
Hahaha 😀😂
Stop white supremacy.
Crack is whack
This crew thanks to the mayor was prolly released b4 this newscast aired 🙄
Harris will bail them out...   So fake news?
For people to understand not to do bad crimes...criminals need to be really pushed....like chopping a hand....so people stop doing stupid things
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👮🏾‍♂👮🏻‍♂ lock their asses up ! Gangs are literally worse than the Klan
Wow nypd is so racist. Arresting the same type of people and releasing them asap due to racist arrest. We need diversity in this type of crimes and not arrest the same people. We need more CRT in that community.
if they sell drugs then they should be held accountable for accessory to murder for all the OD's that take place.
Great work NYPD!
The dems will let them out.
Here come the PO-LEESE.
Imagine that. Arresting bad people finally
I bet the girl in orange got an only fans account. Lol.
No worrys they will be out in a week i feel bad for these cops 😕 no help from there leaders hopefully soon we can arrest the real gang members biden Harris the whole bunch guess quamo went down deblasio should get old school treatment like a 100 years ago
Yep neighbors are taking videos and pictures of the whole operation and handing it over to police👏👏👏😂🤣😂🤣
Police don't arrest gang members in chicago because State Attorney Foxx will not prosecute them....she feels the first two felonies are okay.
They supposed to be Chin Up Chest Out!! Smh they look sad af! GL
At least they enjoyed their labor day before getting busted
Eh that da will cut them lose just a typical liberal who cares nothing about the citizens the mayor is in on it he does not even really support the police.......
Are these some of those white supremacists I'm supposed to be worried about?
Lebrown Staynes’ people
Keep eyes opened on the judges, DA's and politicians.
Take down the mob and biker gangs too
There is so much more than them. A drug selling spot started right on my corner, they always sit out side on the corner, even in the rain looking like dumb dildos huddling under the awning. illegal double parking, parking across the crosswalk, loud music even late at night.  They took over when stores went out of business due to COVID. They think the store's awning and parking on the crosswalk covers them (honestly they're blatant about it) but they're idiots because just watching them from my window, I already know so much.  None of them wear masks either.   They're idiots or just don't give a F!k.
Give them 8 hours till they are out
These bozos always gettin raided lmaoo patria K!
They’ll be let out of course
i just wonder why i never see white gangs being arrested... its almost like they dont exist... or hmm... thoughts??? where are all the white gangs ... i remember the biker gang and police have a full out shootout for like 20 mins in waco texas and not one person went to jail... hell they wernt even called a gang.. they were called a  club
give them nuclear tipped bullets
Gang gang..lol
A family that does crime together  ..does time together
I bet tekashi69 had something to do with this🤣🤣🤣
Can't wait till it get cold outside so some these mfs stay inside more
So foolish and of the devil🤦🏽‍♂️
I hope they get vaccinated while they locked up 🤣
We be poisoning our community every day   Lefreebase James
You know you live THUG LIFE when you wear a useless mask because *THE MAN* told you to!  Useless IDIOTS
#fundthepolice
18-25 year old men and women not going to school or working need to go into the military. It will be better for them and society
Yay! Good riddens haters!
Good job, law enforcement!
Put each and everyone of them behind bars for years. I don’t mind if tax dollars are spent to house these fools, I’d get more pleasure out of knowing their all behind bars then I will using tax dollars to plant a damm tree.
That sure wasn’t enough money to have money counter hmm something is not right   Where is the money?
SO THATS WERE MY LOUIE VUITTON WENT...WHEN CAN I COME DOWN TO THE STATION TO CLAIM IT....
I’m not trying to be a negative nelly but for a huge gang/drug bust I only seen a couple thousand dollars worth of belongings and them stacking the 100’s on top of the bands looking like a re up for a few ounces.The big guy’s must’ve got away 🏃‍♂️🏃🏼‍♂️
How bout catching those thugs from corona too.
If this is wat it takes then it gotta happen cuz too many ppl getting shot and mainly our kids!
How many will be out tomorrow since NY doesn't have bail..
Finally Results
More gun control, that'll work!
Damn 😮
👏☺️
It can't be undone.... D.C removed president trump. police fund is frozen.  It is frustrating.
Arrest their assess!!!
Good Job Police.  Get these thugs off the street.
They'll be back on the streets in 24 hours
One hour ago, I guess they're back on street.
WOWWWWWWW
dayum, someone mummy gotta sad...LMAO
They will all be out in a week.
Good I really hate gangs. Especially the bloods,trinitarios,Latin kings ,net's. I never understood it. All it says that you are scared and want be a follower.  Plain an simple.
Sweet! Now I'll feel 0.000006% safer!
Zero diversity in the gang yeesh. I’m appalled they couldn’t even have one white gangster friend or something.
Biden will let them free soon ,like he did before..... he needs votes
NYC is a Sh+t hole, what kinds of things do you expect to be happening in a sewer. I escaped from NY decades ago...
What about the drug dealers on 34 near penn station who openly sell drugs in front of cops to crack head and they do nothing ?
Fund the police!

Give them all life and if theirs no more room in the jails put them in the ground under the jails
Why are these grow ass people in gangs?
And they say "whites" are the biggest threat in America.
Can you keep them in jail..this time?
And they all listen to that Rap trap bullsh*t
Dominicans...
Now they are on the right track
Now let’s find out why do these gangs evolved and what can be done to stop gang creation.
Not charged with RICO?????
I'll bet you any money, that they will all be out on bond within a week.
Why not arrest the drug kingpins who actually bring illegal drugs into NYC?   These guys in gymn clothes and hoodies will be on their dirt bikes in a few days....cruising Midtown Manhattan...destination.  ......STATEN ISLAND.!
Mostly probably nonfba
👏👏👏👏keep doing what you’re doing folks; gotta make the streets safe for law abiding citizens.
Illegals deport them. Or life in prison no parole.JUDGE!!
Kamala Harris will let them out with the bail out fund
Shit; ALIENS BEING ARRESTED; I’m sure you’re gonna hear what good people they are, studying for their exams.
Shoot em execution style and throw them in a ditch
Dear POLICE: the CULTCHA of these criminals is “stop snitching”, but they snitch all the time. For less than nothing.   Put up a reward, let their own kind turn them in.
They rolled out the mayor? That gang must have been cutting into his profits.
GANG ? 😳 The   Only people I see is adults that they are putting in that truck and getting arrested are you kidding me grown-ass people  acting like teenagers.  Wow
Only 16, we need more
Good shit NYPD it’s about fucking time!
Lock them all up
No bail no jail back on the street tomorrow
Deportation!   Get them the fuck out of here. All that dealing and we still pay taxes to fund their welfare. FOH.
Why can't Chicago do the same...oops I know why.. its all because of Mayor Beetlejuice...
Good job. Here in California they would get probation,  welfare, food stamps,  free housing and their kids get to go to our University system for free.
Thank God for good police work
Violent Crime Squad is in Riverdale because that's one of the last areas in Bronx County that isn't fucked up.
So at 475k a pop to incarcerate these people whether they're found innocent or guilty a year I mean how is that Justice to the taxpayers
Cuomo is gone ,LET THE GAMES BEGIN. GO GET UM ...
Do these people ever keep in shape or without diabetes? Consistently fat af.
And they will be back out the next day. Also where are these socialist workers that the dems keep saying they are going to get to police?
All they're going to do is let them go
IT's all good as long as no "innocent" black girl get shot in these raids
who you trying to kid, they'll be out by tomorrow
At a time when people are not working these drug dealers are out working yet  that's a problem.
AGAIN I SAY "KILL 'EM ALL... PLEASE..   BEFORE THEY INFECF US ALL... Please people just look carefully at this waste that take away our sanity our very breath our loved ones our very lives. Please kill them before they grow. They are like the lowest low ever. Why should they even be in prison and live out of taxpayers monies. Ask youself that... WHAT A FRICKIN WASTE!!! LORD HELP US.!!!
Wheres BLM?
Good. Very good job. Now… it’s up to the damn judges to NOT LET THEM BACK OUT! No bails or excuses.
Very good
this is like "the wire" in real life
NY is only going after gangs because they don't want competition.
Thats just a small number of people they let out now there like we got them again
Meh they will be out in a few. Just wasting time.
all that money and they spend it on clothing and accessories LMAO!
Great work police. Joe and K and swamp have them out jail in 48 hrs.. so sad
Criminal empire. Lol
AOC will make sure they will be home for dinner. DeBlasio will give them keys to the city.  The police will be put to blame.
Thank you NYPD may God bless you and shield you and give you wisdom, in Jesus name Amen .
Damn they even took ya chain lmaooo
Wow this is almost unbelievable.. NYPD going after gangs .. finally doing their jobs
She meant to say due to a lot of snitching in the beginning
This is what the police should be doing and I commend them for this. Keep it up lads and always target these lawbreakers
They’ll all be out in a few hours
Towards the end of the report it's stated that the police expect to arrest more members in the coming days. I don't understand how this was allowed to be announced publicly.
b29st vun.fyi
Nice
🤦🏽‍♂️ this mess will never stop smh
They already did their time, and out on the street again. They got released 1 hour after they got caught.
Catch and release,  right ?
Lots of losers that what they are death penalty for them week minds sad
These terrorists hav no place in society!! Send them to a deserted island!!! N stop voting for these criminals 1st politicians!!

Before jailing people like these.  Jail the studio heads of music companies, movie production companies who promote gang wars and gang violence.
WOW, the NYPD sure is doing one of hell of a job! I'm convinced!
Drugs - easy money...no alarm clock
Political grand standing before the elections. " I'm still Curtis for mayor.
