probably should of been a standing 10 count
Roided out of his head
Benns a rat
Why is he always swearing 🤬
Back when the eggs were helping.
Vargas didn't have enough tattoos, and I'm guessing that he was well and truly past his best when he took this fight
He must of had his eggs that morning
Full of peds
Didn't want to catch COVID so bish bash bosh get out of there with w
Wow, such accuracy and power!!
New Nigel nope he is not as good as old days middle weights
82 secs and he supposed to be a new nicely Ben nope
Eggs lentils
Eggcelent
Egg power
Juicy
He’ll be on his back against ubank jr
And then there was eggs 🥚
So many eggs
Connor benn acts like a roid head
Drugged up to the nuts was Benn, conman.
I think Eubank jr is gonna be in trouble.
Nasty work
Abit of an early stoppage I think first round Yano give the guy a chance
I’m not yolking when I say this was an eggcelent performance. He went in there and eggcecuted the game plan. Vargas was scrambled from the get go and Benn went in like a true poacher. Well done Eggs Benn Addict
No knock down or knock out 😮
With or with out...
Egg power!
Eubank is favourite. But it will be whoever performs on night. We dont know who that will be
Conor was on a massive amount of eggs in this fight
With no crowd back then
Nutritious eggs from grass fed chickens , that's the secret 😂
PEDS then but no can doeeee now.
Oh, I thought it was Antonio fargas, you know , huggy bear !!!
drug cheat
Funny how he’s lost the power since being done for cheating.
Connor Benn Vs Gevonta Davis , i wanna see
On the juice
He tested postive for PEDs by the way, so he's a drug cheat...the guy needs to grow a pair and fight fair.
The power of good eggs is not to be under estimated
Another dozen eggs please .
Watch this fight then watch his recent fight v dobson...power and speed gone i wonder why
This was back in the day when Benn was on PEDS!! Benn has not got the power to crack an egg now 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dam! Im gonna have to get me some of them drugs
why was this fight stopped lool
If he comes like this or better against Eubank Jr, Eubank has no chance
41 unanswered punches..  who ever thinks it was stopped too early is a moron
He was on Juice in this fight . Should of be banned for life.
I know vargas was complaining about the stoppage but he's lucky the ref stepped in on this one
Conor Benn needs to throw with less power.  Be more loose with his punches.  Because if he throws like that and doesnt finish his opponent he will gas out.
Peds does crazy things
He fights just like his father exactly the same.
Bit premature for me
I'd love to see him smash jake paul
He has serious power sheeesh
Vargas was 5 year passed his best 😂
Eggcellent!!
How many yolks pre fight Connor Eggs Bennedict Ben 🤣🤣🤣
Drug cheat
Eggy
Give the man a standing count, far too early for a stoppage
Saucy
,good combo but Early stop ,vargus wasnt hurt
Go on zammo
He got smashed
Stopped just a bit too fast.
Clearly on juice here.
Wow; just wow!!
1:42-1:51. Literally the best boxing combinations ever witnessed in a boxing ring. The speed and accuracy from Benn is godly 🥊
EGGcellent Victory
one of the best early stoppages you will ever see, hands of stone the new generation!
Top Contender 😂😂😂💉💉💉💉
He'll do spence
Juicy
love this, what a beast
Loads of people said he was on juice in this fight but what a fighter if he wasn’t
It all makes sense now💉💉
Looking at this fight now with different ( sad) eyes. I loved this performance. I don't believe he can ever, ever be redeemed now.
We now know how he’s improved
All starting to make sense now.
PED
courtesy of a fertility drug
Young man hits with bad intentions just like his old man
Needs a support worker with that reaction 👷
Difficult to have taken any more of that punishment as he was steam rolling him. Right call definatley
Benn beat another bum big deal when is he actually going to fight a decent boxer all he does is fight bums
Brutal
Why is this titled knockout? The ref stopped it he wasn't knocked out,
Apple did'n't fall far from the tree yikes.
Drug cheat connor Benn
Conor Benn vs Vergil Ortiz!
Savage bloke
He fought an old man
He will be world Champ!!!
Get this guy in more big fights!!!
Stopped way to early! Anyone who follows vargas knows he sarts off slow and is able to take a few punches. Imo ref stopped the fight toooo early. Vargas could have carried on and would have ended up winning as connor would of gassed at that rate in the 4th round
Put him up there 👆🏼
Said it 6 months ago Benn is going places from his own abilities.  Not long got back from work, (NHS), so tired for repetativity, I may have made up a new word.  Apologies 🥊✌
filthy
would have liked to see Vargas take a knee and get proper done. Great win from Benn
Don't  think Nigel !  Thought he was this Good . 🤔 👍 🇬🇧
Took him 90 seconds to realise that counter wasn't going to come, and knew he could unleash
You sure thats not a human punching bag?
He's got punching power and accuracy like his father did
Ruthless
Conor is the real deal. Perfect stoppage by the ref aswell. Big up conor Benn 💯
Beast
This guys would destroy both tommy fury and jake on same night
Future world champ Connor Benn. Love to see him move up to smash Eubank jr
Bad boy theres no stopping him forsure
Why are people wearing face nappies and welders masks.......losers.
Connor gave him a mouse with the first few punches
Think he would destroy eubank
He has a belt in the next 2 years. Easy. Absolute animal
The sad thing is the harder he punches the quicker his hands will damage and break and over time if he doesn’t adjust like mayweather had to and many others he won’t be able to fit the gloves over his casts
This was insane live, it’s still as impressive months later 😯
I do not like these referees jumping in to stop the fight like this. It’s not boxing. We want to see heart & mettle. This looks like corruption.
This guy is going to the top
Nice and steady  getting better and better will be  a world champion  next year 100%.
He’s going places
Vargas says he wernt hurt but I think the stoppage was bang on
Macklin - Gonna be a tuff learning fight
Bad stoppage. Everyone beats the crap out of Vargas early. The kid missed out of valuable experience here.
Fantastic fighter Conor Ben alll the way straight to the top of the world this Conor Ben is boss
This guys looking fire, best of luck to him. Can see big tings for this guy
Benn Vs Ortiz?
Strange he's still not top 10 in ANY of the rankings.
One trick pony and will fade away fast
Angrier after he won
Albanian champion waiting for you why you don't try man... FLORIA MARKU THE BEST 🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱
Fight was stopped way to early though. Vargas has ridden out bigger storms than that, and I got the feeling that he was surprised at the ref jumping in.
1:07
Lovely
Commentary "a learning fight for Benn"🤣😂🤣
He still had respect to hug Vargas good sportsmenship 💯
Absolutely love this man he’s a pure machine just like his dad xx oafaaf
Amazing combos
First time I've seen this guy in action.....he shouldn't be able to punch that hard at that speed....well impressed by that.....will defo follow his fights after watching that
That uppercut in the middle of the combo was top draw
Watch out 👀👀
I like Benn and think he's a good fighter but maybe getting a bit ahead of himself, porter, spence, garcia all batter him.
I have never seen so much improvement in a boxers hand speed as this kid.
Rewatching this it was an early stoppage
Its a wake up call for the division connor i think would blow porter away He hasnt been hurt yet but does he need to get hurt so who does he take next cos he cant take a lower grade fighter the only way is up
I believe in the lad in the ring and out good all round and will only better over time and for terence crawford is the best fighter around pin point accuracy and I think conor benn can be that good
Stopped early
MOST IMPROVED FIGHTER BY FAR.
Any chance of him fighhting Eubank Jnr? What a generation gap fight that would be...
CB Is On His Rise 2 Greatness & Belts Collecting
Just like his dad. Exciting!!
This is why I dont watch boxing anymore, Let the fight continue he's fine.
Feed this guy to Stanionis, that would be a fight
Holy moly mother of all things holy
vergil ortiz jr next forget khan hes done
Vargas was foolish, he allowed himself to get caught by standing head over foot, and then refused to adjust.
Conor benn vs jake paul who would love to see that fight happen
Going further than his dad IMO.
Khan is  to scared to fight the new kid on the block. Conor is off course no kid. I reckon benn gets khan out within 8.
the hand speed and power is impressive. can he keep it up until the later rounds though?
Just like his dad 👊🏿💥🤕
awesome stuff.
That speed is insane
vicious & malicious.!  He looks like a Killer
He’s good
Amir khan to fast for this guy
God every shot hit him so vicious
Yep just like my hero nigel when i was a kid. But looks like he can box better than his old man as well. Another british world champion coming.
OMG / your looking at the future world champ / I think even Benn senior would struggle against that level of performance
That short right savage hook will end Khans life never mind his career
Fight jake Paul just to shut him up
Frightening
Lovely job 👍
Impressive chip off the old block me thinks 👊
Should never have been stopped, Vargas is a veteran an could easily took those an carried on
Love watching this in slo-mo, so satisfying to see the punches land. Congrats to Conor! An obvious underestimate to see the dedication and diligence needed to pull that off.
His punches sound different to anyone else's. He looks awesome, killer instinct as well.
I hope he has the game his dad brought, being around nigels age is a privelage to have been witness to his achievements  Young benn, lookin the part and would be something really special.
Looked lovely tbf
Stopped too early. Should have at least given vargas a chance.
Accept the fight with Florjan bitch. Don't avoid it
Impressive from benn but that wasn’t a knockout. Kid needs to stay focused or he’s gonna end up another Eubank
that speed tho 😲🔥🔥🔥🔥
What happened to giving him a standing eight count then letting him continue? Boxing has become hyper health and safety and it's ruining it.
Imagine if the ref stopped his Dads fight against Gerald McClellan after 40 seconds? Connor is no hype job, but this premature stoppage disgraced Vargas, Connor, ref & the fans.
I'd knock him out with one hand in 10 seconds.
Florian Marku will Knock him out
The combinations were beautiful
I know vargas has lost alot but hes never been stopped like that
Good finish was to early though ref definetly should of left him put him down.
Will you get this man a real fight for God sake he's been at this game long enough
Even his dad said in a pre-fight interview that Conor is the better boxer than he was. I kinda smirked at that comment & thought he was just building up his son. I have watched every Pro fight of Conor's & have got to say, where did this new boxer come from??. Always thought he was ok but what he showed in less than a round in this fight has actually made me think that there may well be something that our Nige has seen in training to justify his comments. Where the hell has that speed been hiding???....Onwards & upwards!!!
Outstanding performance. In his earlier fights he was a fast tippy tappy boxer. now he's got power he's all set. Class
Looks absolutely incredible. Electric ⚡️ can’t wait to see his next fight.
Am I missing something? This performance means he can get inside and beat the likes of Brook and Khan? They're alot harder to hit than this guy! Please get real!
This was like a dragon ball Z fight! >.> How many punches did you see ? I saw 20 >.> no 22>.> No 24 was that a 24 punch combo ?
Why did the ref stop the fight
Go on conor mans on 🔥
His chin will be his downfall
Khan can and will beat you if you get the fight 👊
eeeek
Oh wow. This is Nigel's boy? Nice!
That was impressive punching the combinations he threw finish that all on the button looks like he's got a bit of his Dad's ferocity in him can't be a bad thing just hope he's got the Defence to back it up?
That accuracy and ferocity wow
He will blow away the likes of Shawn porter but not crowford, best fight will be conner Benn and crowford. Good things to come can't wait.
What did I just watch 😳 I'm speechless.
He is looking dangerous. He should still get more experience first because hasn't had much amateur career. Khan won't fight him unless it's a massive payday. Nor will kel Brooke either. Get a few more rounds in then he will be ready for a world title no point rushing him he's only 23/24.
Connor benns good attitude is totally wrong though
Amir who?.... Khan will not fight him as he knows he will get decimated.  Best he keeps with the reality tv bullshine💩
That was electric.
He’s very fast
Went 12 rounds with amir Khan...like that's an endorsement
And that's why I now watch ufc. Despicable stoppage.
😳 Dynamite... Great talent.
His dad said few years back watch out for my boy he punches harder than me . how right you were nigal.
That accuracy was mental
I want to see my brother amir khan beat down Benn
The ref is a clown. Absolute joke. Vargas was robbed
Shame about the tattoos.
KNOCKOUT???
eh? They stopped it, before knock out?  I know a few un-answered hits, but still.  But great performance from Benn.
woooooooowww, so he has much more power than ortiz, khan will get wiped out 100
As mean as his dad. Love to see him matched against Eubank jr. Benn would thrash the little pretender.
The fight should never of been stopped he wasn't even hurt
He’s even got his dad’s style of shorts! 😀
This is what you call hand picked fights!
Omg......its Nigel all over again and brilliant in his own right.Eubank v Benn the next generation.
Amir khan needs to fight this guy!!
Connor speed was out of dis world god damn
Stanionis would slap him
He certainly can bang , if he has a good engine and a good chin , he will be a world beater .
He was snapping his head back at will, those ropes kept him more upright too, watch in half speed, great stoppage for once.
Khan wouldn’t want to get in the ring with him.
Best performance so far, so powerful, accurate and knew when he had hurt him and piled on the pressure.🔥
This guy is powerful
Fury will smash this  chicken
wow!! i avn't seen any boxer do something like that for a longtime wow conor the lion is hungry give him his food his is ready wow.
Tko not ko smh
Like father like son👊
Smashed. Mate they landed beautifully
How is that a knockout?
He a smashing boxer & Arsehole like his Da 🇮🇪
dat's treal homie
WTB some sound.
Not too used to boxing, this is considered a KO?...
Ref was in too early for me. I think he should have given him another 10 seconds to try and defend himself. Nice boxing from Benn though.
Chip of the old block or what.....I wished boxing was still on BBC or ITV like back in conors dad's Day because those of us old enough watched some GRT fights,like when conors dad Nigel beat Iran Barkley what a fight Barkley and his team wasn't expecting the whirlwind in Nigel Benn that Day,just like Vargas didn't with Conor and this opponent is no mug..if it was like back in the day Conor would have millions watching him like his dad,as you can tell I was a huge Benn fan with the old dongs of Big Ben sounding before Nigel walked in GRT stuff exciting just like his dad..
He connected nicely wth them flurrys but the guy wasn't hurt lol stopped way too early
Bad stop...he got hit but wasnt that hurt
Representing IG1 - BOOM!
Ref couldn't wait to jump in 😂😂😂
Khan has a glass chin, He won't be able to deal with this 😂😂😂😂
Sorry but fighting a nearly ready to retire old fighter has and does no justice to himself
Good win for Benn...Maybe another fight against European or British opponent then Marku, then josh Kelly.....If He's successful then let him fight that tough Russian who battered Kelly and he can make that 1st step up to World level..
These breddas are slim but have vicious jabs damn!
Sweet....used to love watching his dad...great performance.
Alright mate, chill out!!
Like father like son 🙏👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🥊
B.s. stoppage
His Dad was the best fighter to watch. Great to see his son has a load of potential to replicate and maybe even exceed his old man.
The speed and power of that right hand. Jesus.
Those tattoos look stupid
Benn has beautiful hand speed and looks very strong. All the best to the Benn family.
A chip of the old block.
Those jabs were lightning fast. Great finish too when he managed to open Vargas’ hands up
Legendary fighter in the making
That fight should never of been stopped
Yay for violence!!!
Not really a knockout was it,
One of those punchs kahns hitting the deck 💯🤣
Hate when they stop it like that
Ge went 12 rounds with khan???....true years ago age comes to the equation.
Why was that stopped? 1st round and Vargas wasnt even floored give the man a chance. Media calling that a knockout, How? Yes Vargas was in trouble and im a Benn fan, both Benns but terrible stoppage from the referee
I mean is no one gonna talk ab the early stoppage ?
Big up BEN!! Like father like SON!
What a gobshite though. Guaranteed he became a fighter to be a thug.
Looks well quick sharp and powerful.  But come on Vargas is a seasoned vet. Way too early stoppage but Benn would have knocked him out properly. Would have preferred to see a knockout.
Fight Marku scary man not amateurs and see what happens🇦🇱💪🏻
He composes himself whilst throwing combinations after the first few punches before the stoppage is what I have been looking in a fighter and trust me when i say this, every top fighter should have known this already, G.O.A.T in the making, absolute fearless.
V impressive that
Faultless performance.
Like father like son 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾💪🏾
👏👏👏👏👏
Wasn’t even knocked out.
Wow. His fathers son
He will become a national sensation no doubt as much loved as the great warrior carl the cobra froch
Wow the more I play it bk the better it gets absolute class from conor 👏 👌
Simply stunning conor benn absolutely lethal 👌 👏
Is this the guy that went to train with Darren Till for a video?
If you listen to the fans with boxing you're either a useless bum or ali and tyson in one. Just let the guy box and support him, great potential, definitely proved he's one of the top prospects
Punches were so quick I’m even confused.
To powerful 4 Kahn’s glass chin
BEAUTIFUL -  Dad must be well proud !!
Ref. Should of left it. For 10 more seconds
big big fan of his dad.He has my support all the way.Can only get better.
Wow
The ref was right to stop the fight,  I know Vargas is not happy with the stoppage but if the ref hadn't stopped when he did Vargas could've been in serious trouble. Well done ref.
But has he got his dad's dress sense?
Wow them punches from 1:40-1:52 are lethal. Ref did a good job as the ropes kept Vargas up, his legs was gone.
Mans getting those new fans every day, getting bigger and better definitely gonna be a star
Ben is dangerous but he still has a lot to learn. That jab jab haymaker isn't gonna work on the elite
The accuracy on the punches is mad
World class
Wow, Conor Benn that was awesome !
Man I felt those punches
Fight stopped to early, look closely and you see the shots were not that accurate towards the end or powerful, ridiculous fight, look at Josh Warrington and the absolute state he was in on the fourth round in the Lama fight but ref didn't stop. Oh my days!!!! this would have been a good fight, we've all missed out, what a massive massive let down this fight is. Vargas is still ready to go, he's still fresh, but people here are giving a big respect to Conor's character and ferocity hence look past the facts: the fight was stopped early. Absolute joke fight, Deontay Wilder had those shots for 6 or 7 rounds and ref didn't stop. I think the ref judged the ferocity of Benn and hence stopped the fight, he wasn't judging clearly the actual shots which were not that accurate or powerful. The sport is corrupt, bad judges, bad promoters and bad ref's and not to mention awful commentators. It is the biggest let down and mismanaged sport in the world and fans deserve and can get 100 times better fights if the entirety of boxing just sorted itself out. I hope and foresee that in thousands of years to come, this sport will be completely different to what it's like now and the best fighter wins.
Wow!
Amir Khan would be best keeping well out of the way 😂
Wow what accuracy and power there from Ben. Amazing skills!
His style reminds me a little bit of a young haye
Too early
pure bred
Definitely stopped the fight too soon. Benn is looking sharp mind.
mma guy here to just say lol EARLY STOPPAGE
I've watched it back 10 times nobodys beating this animal.
Don't see anybody beating him he looks insane.
Good work.
Connor Benn eubanks Jr do what your dad's done
Benn will take over there's just something about him
Very sharp nice sting
Have him fight McGregor, I'd love to see Connor Benn chin him.
Great win in my humble opinion. It will be interesting to see him go for titles soon.
Conner Benn is fast as lightning. He will catch quite a lot in his division. Tremendous technique, speed, skill & strength! Turning time on his old man. Amazing.  🥊💥
Not to be 'that guy' but Benn didn't knock Vargas out, he stopped him. Totally different.
We don't want khan
More easy opponents
Lol he won 2 out of his last 5 proves nothing as always
I still wanna see him vs Marku
Samuel Vargas seemed to have no defense against Conor Benn, Benns punches kept getting through Vargas' guard.  Vargas took them well but then Benn just increased the speed hitting Vargas with punch after punch and the referee had no choice but to stop it.
I'm gonna practice the same punch day in and day out for the next 2 years and go out and turn someone's lights off.first I'm gonna spill a drink on them then apologise..and keep on apologising till they get mad...then I'm gonna get mad and spark him.then I'm gonna apologise to his mate..and keep on app......
If Amir Khan agrees to fight Conor, he must be either bonkers or skint.
Floriannnn Markuuuu 🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱
Fight was stopped too early khan would destroy this kid.
Stop it to early for me vargas wasn't hurt still not convinced
Would have been better if the ref didn’t jump in so early.. he mike tyson’d the guy
Haven’t seen hands that fast for a long time, if he’s got a reasonable chin will be hard to beat.
Reminds me of oldskool Kell Brooke. Quick hands, hard punches but most of all pin point accuracy 👌🏽
Hype train
Nice fight!
Hope he's carries on this was brutal proved he's got something
that right hand. just like his old man 👊
That was an early stoppage. Good performance but Eddie owns the referee lol
People need to stop saying it that the ref jumped in too early. Those punches were spiteful and thrown with mean intent. There was only ever gonna be outcome.
Definatly early stoppage
Oi ben is vicious 😳
Amazing accuracy. Very good performance against a really good fighter. I was shocked and surprised. Will be interesting to see what he does in the future. He has improved so much. Can't wait to see him again. I don't think Khan will fight him though.
Yessssssssssssss benn
Uppercut, left, right Goodnight
Run away Khan.... you don’t want none of this!!! Lol
People think that was a early stoppage!!the ref should of let him get battered for another 5 seconds.we was about to see a brutal k.o.. Lovely to watch that was.
Yep I believe this man can go all the way.
That stoppage was too early he should have been allowed to drop. Conor looking good though everything landing.
Vargas must have thought the ref was throwing punches aswell 🤣🤣
Why you don’t like to fight with Albania 🇦🇱 king Florian Marku because Because you know he will kick you down with one round🇦🇱🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿☝️👏
Woooow. Looking absolutely incredible! Lookout world haha jeez
Was stopped to early clearly see vargas still clear headed benn did good but shouldn't of been stopped
Brilliant ben great performance stopped too soon for me
Definitely moves like his old man... brutal.
Like father, like son. Loving seeing a Benn back in the ring.
PURE GAME BRED 100% CONOR IS LEGIT.
He is one hard bastard 😤
Almost 30 unanswered punches around 95% of the shots landed. Good stoppage Ref 👍.
F all you lotttt ....lol
Put him up there! FS!
Put me up there goodnight😀
Super
Connor benn Legend.
That was impressive
Cant wait to see this guy KO khan
Warrior
Precision level accurate well chosen punches he looks good and has his dads edge too exciting times
Still not convinced. All aboard the Matchroom hype train. 😴 😴.
Brutal..
Nice to see the Benn family back , looks great hes definitely up 4 it !! Hope he goes all the way ,
Mark is wIting for you he call you way you’re refusing you’re p
🥊BOOM BOOM BENN 🥊
Amir who?
He would smash Khan to bits 😄
Surprised he didnt call out Khabib Nurmagomedov
A lot of casuals need to go watch Nigel Benn vs Gerald McClellan, then you will understanding why this was a biased stoppage.
Man he's quick
Ref could have let that go another 10 seconds, guy was hurt but he was still standing.
Speed, power and accuracy, I see a young sugar ray robinson. Some big tests ahead but he got the skills and could get world titles at a few different weights. 👍
Vargas is nothing special, Ortiz Jr would annihilate Benn. Dont @ me
He said he wasn't hurt , he was about to be knocked sparko , well done Benn .
Tyson Fury was on his back on the floor , looked spark out , and the referee gave him a ten count to which he got up and was able to continue in the fight and ended up drawing with Wilder .  I think Vargas should have been given a 10 count by the referee to give him a chance to continue in the fight .  We need to remember also that this was a title fight .  It was stopped prematurely in my opinion.
Come on now, how much did vargas want it?
Wicked right hook and a fast jab see next world champ
Why take a step back and fight Khan? Follow your own path
Benn with Knock Amir Khan to next week!
Even the shots that didn't put Vargas away were terrifying. This guy is scary!
We are all blessed to have another benn representing England
Vargas should thank the ref for stopping the fight when he did Benn destroyed him.He saved him from getting hurt.
If he has pure boxing skills and that nasty edge his dad has then the Americans should be scared. If he gets a 2 big domestic fights just to build his profile then I think he can take on the Americans.
Florian marku🧨🧨😈 is caming
Stopped too soon
Good boxing but where tf did he get the Jamaican accent?
can anybody enlighten me ? these guys weigh 10 stone 7 do they lose weight and come down the that weight or is it their natural walking around weight ? thanks in advance!!!!
Its a great performance from Conor but goddamn is that stoppage early
If this young man surpasses his dad he will be a very special talent
That's a sharp jab! He's definitely got some of his dad's power!
Jermaine jeans commentating a boxing fight🤔
If the ref didn’t stop that he would of gone nite nite.
Good hands hope he goes all the way
As long as he watches his defence. He is gonna be something special. Has speed and power. He's got all the attributes. It's now to to mentality and decision making
He is much improved but definitely not convinced for world level at all
Brilliant by Ben!!!
Just wow💪🏻🔥
Chip off the old block.
Cool
Outstanding 🇬🇧  he’s his own man what a fantastic fighter he’s going to be Khan 😂 no hope khan couldn’t take that punishment NO Connors ready now for Porter 👍
Good performance by Benn but stopped way too early, don't think Vargas was given a chance
Wow
A great selection of very hard crisp fast shots there, can see his dad come out in that victory salute as well , a real prospect
Mubarak hu viyah, kuthiyah :)
I seen a guy as vicious   Oh it was his dad !
That pace is crazy!!!!!
Class act 💪
Yeah!  At last: no stupid **** from the commentators about Conor's lack of amateur experience.  Remember Audley Harrison's glittering amateur career, and all the good that didn't do him?  Best boxers to watch right now, IMHO: Berbetiev and Conor Benn.  More, please!
Was definitely an early stoppage but great start by Benn.
Everything Eubanks jr wishes he was lool
Conor Ben is my favourite boxer now
Shouldn’t of been stopped  Rematch
I did think it was to early stoppage at 1st but his brain was gettin Fryed with them shots good call

He stopped it 3 punches early, he wasn’t wobbling yet
Respecc
The power in them shots 😲🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿👑
Good work by ben, but its first round, let him knock the guy over before you stop it. His dad got worse than that against gerald mcclellan in the 1st round and he still won the fight.  That's not helping either of them.
30 hit combo. Fatality
Lot of casuals about falling for the hype... Eddie hearn loving it lol
Early stoppage... Uk refs always stop fights early
In all fairness the ref should of left it go on it’s the first round like
Bad stoppage absolute joke
Power.  This man is the way forward in boxing.  His dad is a legend.
Look at width of Benns back. That's where the power is.
Ref shouldn't have stopped it even if he classed it as a knockdown it was the first round
This guy is so sharp fast and powerful he’s got the full package 💫🤴🏾
Ref stopped if perfect timing
Benn is like a mini Mike Tyson for me, he’s exciting and one dangerous fighter!! I reckon  kahn and brook should stay clear! To young and dangerous for both! Can’t wait for his next few fights to see how he progresses👍
Gevonta Davis v Benn undercard fury v AJ
Wow!!!
His dad didn't have that accuracy very nice that
jake paul here we come
world class
I haven’t seen anyone that ferocious in years, this guy looks the real deal
Just a friendly message not related to this video ☺️ God loves you, no matter who you are, where you’re from or what you’ve done. He’s waiting with open arms for you to accept Him into your lives. I hope you have a lovely day. God Bless You☁️🙌
That corkscrew over the top right just like a GGG move started it and wobbled him. Benn noticed this and went straight for the kill. Absolutely first class.  Listening to the commentary tho they said seconds before it that it will be a really tough test for him.  Unreal how he demolished Vargas.
Big fan of both the Benn's, this was a master class tearing someone apart, he deservse to get to the next level, and push on,  my only concern is, this Vargas (who is / was good) didn't test Benn once, we need to see Benn take a few digs..   having said that, boxing is about avoiding being hit, so if he can make it so he never gets hit then were in for a treat.
Yessss.. The Benns are back.. What a performance.. Looks like his dad, talks like his dad and fights like his dad.. World champ like his dad.. ❤️❤️🥊🇩🇰🇬🇧🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿💥💥💥
Bla BLAH roooarrr everyone look how hard I am I just beat up a sack of spuds
Actually I take my word back Vargas didn’t look much hurt there. Ref should’ve waited to see if he is wobbling or dazed
Yet another example of the sky commentary experts knowing their stuff! “ tonight will be tough for Benn “ Just give us the sport. U
some people just shouldn't comment on boxing.
That was quite impressive - fast, accurate hands. One wonders if the ref stopped it too early but vargas did seem to be getting hurt. Benn would destroy Khan right now!!
Why not a standing count?
First time watching Benn and wow!
Coming on nicely, definately improving, fast and accurate, he seems to have dropped the wild swinging punches and times them much sweeter now. Come on Conor Benn
Unbelievable performance from Benn.  He was razor sharp against Formella, and now he's just done that to Vargas.  All that said, I do feel Vargas should've been given more opportunity to weather that early storm.  The man is tough, but the ref waved it off a little early imo.
At least he covers his chin now, he used always have that low guard
Wwoooow
That's not a proper knockout ,he  didn't stay down for a 10 count 😢
Great performance from a very good fighter. And still pricks thumbs down the video, racism is a disgusting disease 🤔
And Vargas can't understand why ref stopped the fight 🤣
Stopped to early
Wow that was beautiful
Feeling out process 👀
I'm not gonna google it..... Is this Nigel Benn's son ?
If you're a man fight with Florian Marku you idiot.
Double ben
Great accuracy. He still won't win a world title but very good all the same.
Florian marku Will knock you down if u fight him mate !
Even the Connor speaks reminds me of His Dad... well done champ
Cant argue with that!
looks like a mini mike tyson nigel benn hybrid ! boom  !
The Real Desl great KO
Wtf did someone speed up the the video?
Vargas can have no complaints there, the referee made the correct decision at the right time. Respect to anyone who climbs between the ropes.
That speed he gets on his throws and the power he gets behind each punch. The ferocity just screams Tyson in his early days.
What an animal, I got tired just watching Benn
Speed and power! Quality sir 👏👏👏
Exterminate Exterminate 🇬🇧
Glad I weren’t in there 😩
No standing 8 a bit quick of a stoppage but good win
this guy is next champ
Speed of the jab and then the overhand right was impressive.
I love the venom on that hook after the one two, beautiful
Like his dad great to watch scary
I always watched his Dad in awe back in the day and this is utterly scary how vicious Benn Jr is.
Why did he stop the fight? Proper early stoppage like.
I saw fatal weakness in his boxing. Conor is too soft, after throwing so many accurate punches, Vargas should have been on canvas but Conor punches no more than fast accurate slaps.
That combo was beast, just saying 👌🏽❤️
😧😧
Scary speed and power, this young man will be going places quick
Even a prime Khan wouldn't touch Ben Amir glass chin Khan 🥊💥😵
That stoppage was  bang on
I'm a big fan of benn but being honest the ref stopped that early vargas wasn't even tickled facts
When you upload the full fight and it’s only 2 minutes long you know it’s good
That was stopped too early
Impressive. Very impressive Conner is making his own name rather than living off his dads name. Keep working Conner I enjoy following you.
Wow
Really good boxer but it was stopped too early
That finishing instinct is special, get that’s smell and what foul lies can only be described as pure unadulterated violence!
Stoppage was to early
Incredible Hand speed
Conor looks sharp well done.but refere done a mistake!!!
Bad call ref, where was the 10 count? the ropes were the only thing stopping vargas from hitting the deck
Nice 💪Benn
Ref should have given him a standing count at least. He didn’t even get dropped.
🔥🔥🔥🔥👀
His punches are so sharp and accurate. Definitely a chip off the old block
Why did it stop !
The hug at the end broke covid rules - and why are they not wearing face masks? and how come social distancing rules don't apply to boxers?
commentor says this is gonna a long good fight hahahahaha
I dont know much about connor benn ,I was his dads  sparing partner , I fought his dad in 1982 and in 1984 , His dad was good and fast ,  , looks like son his doing ok . good luck to the lad .
Wow. Theres no way Amir Khan will get in the ring with him.
Oof he's got his dad's power 😳
And that ladies and gentlemen is a boxer who is not only a very humble young man, but also a very intelligent young man. A man whose own father is a huge credit to his country and whose own son is a chip off the same block. The world is his oyster, and he has everything about himself in place to go forward and do what he wants to do. And the who;le nation will be 100% behind whatever he does. Well done mate. That was super impressive.
Ben is a good fighter I believe strongly that this fight should not been stopped Samuel had a lot more in him an was not ready to be stopped...
Benn on the heavy bag in there
What an improvement by Connor, his use of the jab as a punch, rangefinder, a way to control Vargases head when he tries to rush in, then at the end he sees that Vargas moves both hands forward to block the jab, so he feints it and lands a huge right hook to the opening Vargas made for him, and from then on landed accurate power punches. Looks like they almost all connected If you get hit clean  with 15 unanswered shots and look hurt the ref has no choice but to step in and stop the fight, good decision by the ref
One guy assumed a role of a punching bag
SHEEEEIT!!!!!
That was a hard pace. Dont think he could keep that up for 12 rounds. Good job though.
Fam, I'd love to see Connor Benn take on Chris Eubank Jr!!!! This would probs ressurect the deadly rivalry their fathers had in the 90's cuh both as sickk boxers!!!
How come it was stopped?  (I don't watch the sport so have no idea)
Controlled fury. Impressive power and accuracy.
Bit premature.
Just listened to a Vargas interview he was saying the ref shouldn’t of stopped it bla bla. Lol he’s luck the ref stopped it ! He would of been unconscious in about 3 more seconds otherwise. Benn looks great. Give him a shot. 👍🏻.
0.50 seconds was Ben's only flaw in that top notch performance. A heavy hitter with aggression would have tagged him as he ducked,looked up and left his jaw exposed
People who saying ref stopped it to early, not at all he saved Vargas from a brutal KO,  Ref must have seen Vargas’s eyes disappear into the back of his head,Conor went into Animal mode.
Fair play to Connor he's no daddy's boy
connor benn vs chris eubanks jr maybe?
early stoppage imo. Benn looked great though.
Absolutely amazing!!! The way he was punching it's unbelievable!!! Skills and technique!!! Well done Connor!!!
We love you both ie connor and nigel.
another cream puff destroyed.   When are you going to step up; you're 24 FFS?!?!?!?!
Vargas didn't expect that but his next opponent will.
Ferocious, can’t wait to see where his career goes
Why was that stopped? Rigged bullshit to set up a Eubank or Khan fight.
the speed of those punches!  wow!
FLORIAN MARKU IS LOOKING FOR YOU
STUNNING.
Connor is great and only getting better with time true legend like his dad Nigel
Good work just like his father great boxer
wasnt a KO but okay
Bull!! The ref made the wrong call but a win is a win.
Amir Khan pace but with power this guy is deadly
Too early stoppage.
Stunning Performance By Conor Benn......His Father Nigel Will Be Very Impressed Along With The Rest Of Us..Phenomenal Display Of Accuracy...Speed And Power ...He Ate The Guy Up Good Style..... Future World Champion..
Ok, so maybe the ref stopped it a little early, but if the first few exchanges were anything to go by, Vargas was in for a beating. Was only going to be a few more swings before he was knocked down and possibly injured. I know boxers always say they were not hurt, but he was one good punch from going down. Benn looked too sharp, too accurate and too hungry for Vargas. Benn is not ready for the big boys yet, but if he continues on this path then he is surely going to the top.
On his feet, hands are up guarding his face. Why is it stopped. Yes he is 5 seconds away from getting KO in all probability but at the moment the fight is stopped he is fighting/defending. Its not up to the referee to decide mercy. Its the rules of boxing he had to follow.
when commentators said Vargas had gone 12 rounds with khan i turned it off
Brook/broner/avanesyan next 👍
Woah hes dangerous
Better defence than the old man, but just as quick and fluid. Definitely one to watch.
Come on now ref
Great performance. He was whooping him but that stoppage was a bit premature tbh.
Sent his head back but shouldnt of been stopped
No where near a knockout , after watching it a few times I realised the fight was finished too early
English refs....lmao
bad bad stoppage...its a fight for godsake.
Do your self a favour and watch in x.25 speed
Can I ask (not a boxing fan) why was the match stopped? He didn’t fall to the ground, nor look like he wouldn’t be able to continue, is there a rule that I’m not understanding here?
Jesus is the way the truth and the life . There is no other way to heaven except through Him. Repent before it’s too late ... it’s your choice .... heaven or hell . He loves you so much that He died for you ... He didn’t die for you to ignore Him . He died for you to turn to Him !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Change your ways and turn to Him!!!
I genuinely feel like the fight was stopped too early. Vargas bounced into the ropes but he wasn’t “gone”. These guys are warriors and should be allowed to battle like warriors. Ref came in way too early for my liking. Benn may be legit but I genuinely feel sorry for Vargas for not being allowed to fight.
Very spiteful he will go far
Wow those boxers have no legs mass
That was impressive 👌
Was it early?
That was vicious
Great hand speed. Excellent foot work.
Well done ,did well
Seemed a bit early though considering he's fighting vargas
good lord. assassin.
Powerful
Damn
omg eubank jr must be considering if he could win himself
Good fight Connor 👏  I read article my old dear sent about you and your father  anyway good luck  And believe me his faith in Jesus is very important trust me! Maybe be careful about that church or someones  extreme views 🤔
Is that Nigel Benn's Son? My gosh those punches could easily take a man's head clean off
Bens a great fighter but wrong choice from the ref lol he was still there
Stopped way to early
Dont get too carried away. Vargas was a shot boxer even before he stepped in to this ring
it was his jab
Watch how he finished him once he caught him he peppered him with a few jabs and picked his shots impressive, I loved his old boy 1 of my favourite fighter's of all time and I'm fast becoming a fan of his son got a feeling he may be like his pops and I can't wait to see him in the big fights
Hope you get to read this Conner, you sir are going to be a world champion for sure, no more living in the shadow of your Dad, the great Nigel Benn, you will be a great champion in your own right. Superb performance in every way.
Well done, you can see some of the reactions and movement his Dad had too.
Too early. Vargas could have gone on.
Don't worry, there's a quiet mexican out there just waiting for him. He'll meet his real match one day just like his papa did when he met collins.
Benns a good fighter but that  getting stopped then was a joke what a stich up that was shows how corrupt boxing is pathetic
Awesome amazing
A man definitely NOT living in his dads shadow , whoa...wont be long till he gets a world title belt a reckon , he has a punch power and the accuracy that would scare a heavyweight
Khan will put this guy to sleep easy!
Too early stoppage only first round no knockdown nothing,  refs been bought
Hope Connor stay grounded.He got some big name in that division.Will fight him ,because they don't look like they want to fight each other
Sorry that was stop too early
Benn vs Victor Ortiz Jr
Father like son.
Shame he’s an arrogant prick!!
Wow,he means buisness.
Getting on dat Benn hype train. Let's go!
Would like to see him against Lewis Crocker soon! I think it would be a different story
Just putting it out there but that looked an awfully quick stoppage....but, that jab is damn good followed by the quick right looks awesome!
Damn his hands! Impressive. Keeping my eye on this one
Stopped too early.
Stupid headlines again.
Correct stoppage.Benn is showing a bit more destructive action now.Forget Khan,beating a ring aged Khan doesnt improve Benns stock.Didnt like Benn at first but this was impressive.
a we de rars benn was doing combos like a video game ,dangerous
Jarron Ennis would destroy Benn
Vargas wasn't in trouble and the fight was stopped too early, bad ref!
Can’t believe what I just seen when the guy said learning fight for Conner benn 😂😂😂😂
Wow, I didn’t expect that! Well Done lad 👌🔥🔥
Vicious.
He went 12 rounds with Amir Khan, so???
No standing count 👀 tko not ko and way too early. Would benn of got a standing count if roles reversed????
Damn he was sharp, crisp and powerful!!!
Looked awesome against a shot fighter. Bravo.
Wasn’t a ko it was a tko
Try it with Florian Marku🇦🇱 you little bitch
That was a class performance from conor ben
That uppercut was a game changer.
This young man is going places well done Conor
Corrr it’s just like watching NIGEL 25 years ago I believe this kid Gud   Be even better ,, he’s right though the experience is his father and team to a certain extent GOOD LUCK CONOR YOUR ON YOUR WAY DYNAMITE 🧨
Great performance, shame he's such a arsehole.
Can someone explain, he was still standing so how was it a ko
Absolutely brilliant and devastating
Khan's got a glass jaw, Connor Ben will destroy him in the first round, his jab alone would be too much for him, nigal Ben done a great job teaching him talent
Conor has come on in leaps and bounds!!!
Benn is a boxing masterclass here
SAVAGE .
Fighting with passion n intention looked class tbh
Can we see Eubank jr v benn jr
too early , count him first
kinda a bullshit stopage, but he'd prolly have done him harm with another round.
What was the walk out song
The speed an power whats gonna make him deadly
I am surprised the ref didn’t stop it sooner
he picked his shots very well, didn't get overly excited when he realised he'd hurt him, took his time between punches to throw the right shots in combination, those uppercuts were brilliant.  early stage Connor would have gotten too close, wouldn't have been able to get his shots off. he kept his range so he could really get those shots off, great performance.
I think Benn eats wasps for breakfast.
Strong accurate and powerful. Looked like he wanted to really hurt him. I'll keep my eye out for this guy
Is he african, he looks african.
I remember Nigel was so explosive that he blitzed boxers apart...
he doesn't need amir glass chin khan. when did he even last fight?
Marku still waiting☝🥊🥊
FOOKING hell Conor!
nice but also a bit of a doyle
Own style own man nice work Conor
To be honest, Benn would kill Khan with punches like that.  Amir Khan has a glass jaw.
2:43, "I think this will be a tough fight for Connor" says the commentator. Exactly 63 seconds later the ref stops the fight lol
Early stoppage like but regardless Vargas had nothing for Benns onslaught
Wow
Any commentators available with the ability to not predict the exact opposite of what is about to happen please apply to Sky Sports. They spoke, I bet that they were very wrong. Winner
Good stoppage in my humble opinion.
I'm very impressed with the power + accuracy that's delivered by Benn! Who would win out of Canelo vs Benn???? would be an interesting fight!
Absolute beast. Power and precision..
Great display from Benn ruthless showing Vargas no respect and picking his punche's carefully even with the speed he's gunna be a ppv next fight ?
Well Nigel said he’s gonna be better than him so I’d be worried upcoming opponents 🥊 🥊 🥊 🤪  not sure if Eubanks is same weight class but that be a fight and a half to watch  The fathers where 2 of the best world class boxers for there time imho and both sons are looking pretty dam good and not walking in there dads shadow but have inherited some of the natural I’m gonna spark u out instinct
Christ he is fasy
Impressive
I prayed for Benn and he didn't let us down! What a talent we have here! 🥊
Looked a total mis match physically tbh I know it counts for nothing at all, but even before bell there was only one winner. Looked pumped up for it more too
What took so long for the ref to step in? He was hurt three times before the final flurry even started.
Good stuff but should’ve immediately gone to the opponent and shown some respect, it shouldn’t take the corner man to send him over to him.
Weird stoppage but he looked good.
So that's a knockout even though he didn't drop him. Lol. Stopped way too early. Joke 🤣
That last shot must have taken the wrinkles out of his nut sack.
Conor Benn vs Tank Davis I know different weight divisions but that would be a good match up
Ahh let the man go down, take a knee at least.
took him apart haha
Referee stepped in way too early
Albanian King ‘Marku’ waiting for u mate!He gonna prove u  who deserve the title mate!Maybe he has not the sponsors u have but he has the strength and i am sure as soon as he gets the possibility to fight against u,he gonna prove to everyone his class 👋
Benns  way to much for  khant  glassjaw...and khant knows it..
Benn is violent
Blistering hand speed, accuracy to die for, dads DNA and what a dad he is, going to the stars, great job Conor
Benn looks really good
The destroyer.
i had Vargas up on the cards for the first 18 seconds.
Hahaha pathetic rasta
Vargas was a spent force  nothing but a shell top level fighters will hit him back then there will be  seen if he is real deal
Damn, he showed his father's heart in this one. I think Conor Benn is going all the way someday. Vicious, gritty and predatory. Very impressive. I bet Nigel was proud.
Top trending video on you tube 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤 cuzzy went in
Proper aggressive loved it
that tense music at the start is really annoying lol
The ref cheated that match.
Insanely good stoppage by the ref
Could the Ref have given Vargas an 8 count? I'm not taking anything away from Conor, but.......
Did he say F all you lot to the crowd
Good performance but stopped too early in my eyes, Vargas was rocked but not to the point of being stopped.
😯Wow damnn what a accuracy and precise and strong speed jab and I just loved the sound of punch pounding
Great stuff, bigger fights and purses await.
💨💨💨
Somebody needs to put dream speed run music in the background
We all want Benn vs Eubank
Connor Benn is a serious boxer very good ofc has his weakest but I like his style doesnt waste alot of punches once his defense tighten up he gonna be running the divison
This fight was stopped too early, ref shoulda waited for a knockdown
Stopped to early !
We need Amir Khan vs Kell Brook and the winner can fight Conor Benn
Ben looks very good
His dad was a monster in the ring , nothaft showing hes going to be an even bigger monster  a class performance
If Taylor moves up to welterweight this Benn v Taylor would be a good gauge!!
He’s definitely improving every time...like it
Stopped the fight tooo early
All casuals - calm down.  Samuel Vargas. Is well past his best, and has never beaten a True top 10  welterweight.  When Conor fights the the likes of Shawn porter  or Danny Garcia it will be a whole new ball game.  Never mind the likes of Spence, Crawford.  Different  Gravy..
i said it from the start no doubts, this man is deadly just like nigel,, cant wait to see next victim, GOD be with you bro to the top.
If the ref didn’t step in he would have been charged for accessory to murder.
Guys a div
Like his dad him maybe a bit faster🥊🥊
Like his amazing dad said , he couldn't box, Conor can,and he has his dads skill set as well.
That was stopped far to quickly, but he would of still win. So probably the right decision
Great performance, he's going to be a World Champ for sure,but it wont come easy.
He would annihilate Amir. First round KO.
Wow just wow that right hand is like a train .Go on Benn I would love to see him and Khan .
And Benn glad the ref saw common sense.
Lets his fist do the talking.
Kahn will stand no chance against connor
That’s was clinically wonderful and absolutely savage to watch 👌👍😁
Shame he didn't make a proper apology over the happy feet comments, I can't back a man with that attitude.
Ref stopped that too early. Come on. Be real. Benn looked good but that was not a fight. It was a promo.
Spiteful wow
Ive been saying it since the amatuers. He's a devastating fighter
Jesus christ, those punches were brutal, clean as anything
No doubt this was a good win,  no doubt benn takes his job seriously and there's no doubt he's got dangerous fast hands in the first 82 secs.  But all this ppv talk is nonsense,  he just stunned a fading half decent fighter early on and got a quick stoppage.  So once again, it was a nice win, and before all the people who have only recently just started watching boxing jump in with hater accusations etc, it's early days, benn needs another fight now,  one which will be tough for him and the opponent doesn't get ended quickly.  And yeah, this on paper looked like a hard night and it wasn't,  so let's try again with another name.  If he got in the ring and did this again to another well known fighter you could then argue there was no luck in it.  We need to see him in a tough 6 to 12 rounds next
Going all the way that lad... Speed, power & precision is incredible.
I will be  honest and say that from the very little that i had seen of CB i was very sceptical about him going anywhere above domestic level in the sport.I saw highlights of a real battle he had with someone and he seemed to lack any meaningful power but my word has he improved going on this performance.Fair play to the lad and just shows what hard work and determination can do.
Taking nothing away from Benn but this was prematurely stopped. Watch vargas vs ortiz Jr. Vargas got cought but he wasn't hurt. I would've liked to see this fight go to see Benn put that work in. Very poor from the referee.
Why are people still talking about amir Khan his done, he was done long time ago, Khan would last 30 sec with Ben anyway
So it begins... definitely my new favourite boxer. 💯 he will be better than his dad was. I don’t say that lightly either. I’d love to see him smash Eubanks jr up too. 🔥
Fantastic accuracy.. Nothing wasted there... Nice work.
Thats Nigel right there enit
What an absolute 🔔 end hate him more than I hate his Dad!
Fast, accurate, powerful and definitely a chip off the old block!
Other guy didn’t even punch
this is the one  guy who jake paul wouldn't call out 😂
its like nigel is back
This is a fight, he didn't go down or wobble, he took a couple of punches, Stupid stoppage.
can only beat whats put in front of you.shame so many excellent boxers in the division but his young so will prob become a champ sometime. just keep feeding him past their peak fighters until then
They were some hard punches
Very impressive, was still a British stoppage tho..
This lad will go all the way, he's vicious.
The ref could have let that run a bit longer
If you want a big money fight I'm talking BIG money for the UK Connor Benn v Chris Eubank Jr ...
I’m sorry to say this was stopped prematurely and would have been stopped so soon in another country
Just needs to be protected from gangster types.
Definitely should have let him carry on.
Amair cant box khan i thoughht he was retired if he fights benn hel b retired after that 😏
Are u watchin ronnie pickering 🤣🤣🤣
shame chris eubank jr has retired to play poker. think benn woulld have destroyed him.
Jesus !!
Love Conors attitude. He talks like his old man too, absolute class
I'm  just wondering he punched him 3 times in the face but Vargas didn't fall.
Future world champion
Benn v Saunders!
Huge improvements by Benn he really looks the business now.
He’s got some power just like his dad ..
You could see the power difference from the start
Conor Benn looks the real deal.
World champion in the making💥🥊
I am now a fan and will watch his career with intrigue
That was BEAUTIFUL 😍 boys got venom in them punches 👊
TKO to be fair. Looks like he hits harder than his ol man.
Fast and accurate.
Jaron Ennis next? Florian Marku? I don't care what anybody says but we found out nothing new about Connor in this fight
Looks like a better boxer than Pops...
2 weeks ago I said Connor Benn wouldn't become world champion because he's not good enough 😕 last night I ate my words 😅 the kid showed brutal power accuracy and a skills beyond anything I have seen from him before his man strength has kicked in he's improved so much he's definitely getting very interesting 👊👊👊
Khan won’t want anything to do with Benn with that sort of punching power on display. His glass chin wouldn’t last very long.
i been watching this boy from the start he got that spark always loved his dad too!! khan will get hurt.
Impressive
That's a premature stoppage, he was fine, should have let the fight continue given his experience. Vegas was hurt but was covering up
Was looking at the fancy dress and paintwork, missed the fight 🥱
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 SUPERB PERFORMANCE 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 thanks for the video, SKY SPORTS BOXING
What was up with that stoppage? It was the start of the fight. Why not just give him a count?
First round he took a few good punches he was using the ropes ni need to stop the fight bad referring. He had his hand up legs where ok not good
Impressive World class proformance again ..hes improving so much every fight its crazy...he will  be a  world champion in next  2 - 3 fights .good luck conor and god bless u...
Called to early though
Conor was in that first round with powerful punches that made Samuel take a defeat. In boxing if you don’t take advantage of the power you have in the first round then you may lose the fight in the second round.
I remember Steve Collins made his old man sit down... twice.. good times.
Unbelievable Ben keep up the great work
If that had been Benn up against the ropes he would have got a standing 10. The ropes kept Vargas up why didn't Vargas get a 10 count,
Conor should just go for Terrence Crawford. Reckon Benn would destroy all the top guys!!
Conor, that is the best I have seen you fight! Seen no one with your speed and power recently. You showed what the people were waiting to see. Respect man.
The ref stopped it too quickly.
Lightning  quick 🔥
Benn finishes like AJ
Incredible.
Made his dad proud respect
Well done son...🤛🤛🤛
Early stoppage? I know benn was landing heavy shots but Vargas was still there and didn’t seem to fazed, at least see if he can recover a bit
Won 3GS last night thanks to this man.   Well done
That surprised me surprise
Ben went street on him... I need a slow motion on the last few seconds
Conor Benn has arrived!
He's not the devastating one-punch finisher his Dad was but his hand speed is far better, that finish combo at the end... whooooo!
Benn is a rising star.
Damn I felt those punches
Shame about the gobbing off like a 10 year old child at the end.
WhY he so angry who was he shouting at ??? He looked lot better than last fight
yoooo wtf holyyyy
More tattoos than talent on display here
Who put me up here?
Lean and mean like his dad
This is why you never take any notice of ring side commentators.
Typical British ref. Stopping the fight way too early in favour of the British fighter
Benn looking good but let's see what happens when he faces real opposition like Marku or Ortiz..Good kid though, improved loads.
I can’t believe how much he’s improved!!
crawford apart i,d give benn a chance against any of the top boys
Yeah you ?
BEAST
The fluidity, punch selection and differing variety of power in each of those punches made that final combination lit 🔥
Beauty from Mr.b
Good performance but calling out amir Khan isn’t gonna help u need to fight an active fighter
Why stop it.
No power from Vargas . Like fighting a Manikin .
Where’s the knockout?
Conor Benn vs Chris Eubank Jr has to happen at some point when Conor moves up to Middleweight. The rivalry continues even if it don't happen. It's great to witness the next generation maintain their father's legacy while creating their own...true or correct?
Looked world class here 👏
Woi oii ...naughty!!!
Wow.that was pure power
He is still not up to marku, what a pus
I've always liked Conor but like many others was always a little sceptical at him reaching the heady heights of world level due to the nature of his previous fights, but the Formella and now Vargas performances have really shown how he has matured within the space of 18 months. He looks solid, lightning speed and very spiteful power in every shot from every angle. Boys the most exciting uk fighter right now hands down, and could go all the way!! If he keeps his feet on the ground and keeps learning he can achieve the goals he wants!! Massive respect 🙌 🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
That was excellent
fantastic performance by Conor Benn, more please.
The Warriors code just had a wobble down in Brighton
Moments before the bell I said to the missus I’m not sure if I rate him (Benn) so much. I soon ate my own words. Well in lad
Shades of Hughy Fury mick Hennessy reckons
Bad stoppage could of at least give him a standing 8 count still don’t think benn is big enough at welter weight though to make it to the top
A bit too quick  to finish it in first round  but well done benn keep improving x
Watching Benn a few years ago against peynaud, I thought no chance is he going anywhere. But hes come on massively since then and I reckon he could definitely mix it up with the big names at the weight.
Ferocious🔥🔥🔥
His  inheritance n DNA is there like his dad powerful puncher
Benn Vs marku that's what I'd like to see
That was lovely
WOW 👏
Now that's impressive
Nigel Benn was one of my favourite boxers in the 80s/90s. His son looks like he will be more explosive than his dad🧐
All for the safety of the boxers but did look a bit early to stop the fight
Ahh that long powerful jab ! This man is strong!
Thats how you finish!
Awesome fight
There was a lot of spite in them punches
I rated you from the start and I’m glad ur up more now keep going
Jab superb,fast right hand,very impressed.
I've always known lil bro is vicious..you've got to be ready to go all in if ur in the ring with him..
I think veterens get put off by the focus on the sounds of hits instead of it being muffled by crowed noises
Watch on 0.5 speed, beautiful work Benn 👌🏼 wish it would've gone on longer but Vargas wasnt throwing back
Good knockout. Terrible shorts
Statement that yeno
Wow, pure power
Was a decent flurry of punches .. ref should have let it go on until vargas took a knee ...
All the screaming from the commentators does my head in, bring back Harry Carpenter, or Reg Gutteridge.
Benn would have knocked him out....but c'mon referee...this guy has been in there with experienced fighters.
The world is watching conor benn 🥊
Too many casuals cocky upcoming boxer think he's the top don and wants a 2 weight world champion boxer past his peak
Lean mean machine gun.
Booooooooooooooom shut upppppppppppppp!!!!!!!!!L!L
try florian marku u pussy
Very impressive
Imagine if he had the power his dad had😳😳😳
Feel like the stop was abot early but well done benn. Anyone mention Khan and him in the same sentence are silly. Benn is a young prospect who's going to challenge for wolrd tiltes. Khan is a old man way past his prime who gets koed by a strong breeze
all the class and power of his dad but, this journey is going to be very exciting.
Fantastic performance from the son of my all time favourite boxer.....well done Conor👏👏👏👍
Quality
Vargas isnt Marku..... Florian will destroy Benn  🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱
Whether anybody likes it or not. I don’t know this guy however he is the fastest punching British boxer I have ever seen. He needs a world class coach to get to the very top. He is a talent. Keep your head low
Savaged him stiff 1z
This seem like an early stop to anyone else?
An absolute savage just like his aul man ☘️👑
Calm down, Calm down! One swallow does not a summer make.
He’s so powerful it’s unbelievable he’s also so fast it’s lovely to watch a fighter like him
Amazing hand speed  and power but solipism and ego and immaturity will hinder him and he won't climb the mountain his handlers or he expects. Sad, a little like King Lear me thinks but I wouldn't say it to his face. Lol
Like the spite in his approach, he wants to destroy not play 👍🇬🇧
Thats the best power speed shape ive seen benn in,,,  fair play 👍👍🙂
A  chip of the old  block ...Ding Dong ....it's Benn strikes again !!
For anyone saying it was an early stoppage watch it at .25 speed Benn landed 11 clean shots in the space of 15 seconds which were unanswered Vargas was wobbling and was about to be brutally knocked out the Referee saved him a trip to the hospital
All I can say is 'bye, bye Amir Khan'. 🤜💥😵
amazing speed power and aggressiv as heel Nice one.
His interview after tho Lmao im not bothered by what people say but put respek on my name !!!?🤣🤣🤣👊🏽
Ref definitely shouldn't have stopped that, I wouldn't call that a knockout, and why is he calling out Amir Khan? If he wants a real test call out Chris Eubank Jr
Benn looks like he wants a legal means of killing 😳😂
Like his dad   A MACHINE
Ficking hell
That’s a statement 🥊
Jermaine jenas😂🤔 what's he doing commentator wise on here.  Of course i joke 🤙
🥊🇬🇧😎
Vargas can argue the stoppage but let’s be honest that early in the fight he should have taken a knee because he was going to get starched against the ropes otherwise I couldn’t see it going any other way. Feet planted looking to slip and getting absolutely cracked for it even though he’s a tough cookie I think the ref stopped him from taking some serious extra damage
No point questioning the refs decision mate, you were down with  next left.
*TKO.
He’s rapid.
I’m going to get a fight arranged with this guy
Boom!!!
Roadman vs Sicario
Early stoppage guy was eating puunches but not hurt
Benn vs Khan let’s hav it
top contender, top contender, put me up there! proceeds to call out Glass Chin Khan... lol
Eubank snr should take notes on how to pass the torch successfully
great win. but that should not of been stopped.
V impressive. Sensible stop from the ref
Absolute beast benn is the improvement in this guy in a short space of time is unreal. Big up yourself bro 💯
Big fan of coner benn been watching all his fights he’s Gona go along way hits hard has loads of speed deadly Can’t see him being beaten for a while good job coner unbelievable performance
This is our next ppv mega star. One of the best fighters to walk this earth. Hes got it all.  Great to see the apple doesnt fall far from the tree. 🤟🤟🤟🤟
Wow very impressed 👍🇬🇧
Wow
Power or what, good show conor,  big up your dad .
Scary speed and accuracy
Dam, connar landed pretty much every punch.  That was an absolute master class performance 👌
What's Vargas' record?
Nice punching ,very sharp🔥
Squash that beef with the over rated mouthy Albanian, fight will sell for Eddie then go for a top 10
The best he's ever been in the ring. Clinical skill with more than enough power. Really impressed 😎🤘👍
Spanked.
Rapid
Awful commentary, they were just on their opening chatter and hardly talking about the fight!
I feel sorry for guys picking a fight with this guy not knowing he is a relentless, vicious boxer with hands faster than lightning.
Connor Benn's hands are made from lead!! Seriously dangerous!
So impressed with this kid.
Chins still open on occasions, but he is an animal for sure, he could trouble the best for first 6 rounds, think hes too strong for spence.
Well done bonny lad onwards and upwards 💪
GG7
I think Vargas had better retire. He made a great impersonation of a punch bag. Benn seems to have finally learned his trade.
Vargas record last 6 fights W1 L4 D1
Always supported Connor... Even more so now😜💪👊 amazing.
Horrible, Benn ain't playing boy , khan will get slapped up if Benn is focused like this .
Savage let’s go Conor, spiteful punching amazing performance.
Wtf the ref stop to early
Benn should fight Avanesyan
Referee stopped the fight waaay too early.
Virgil ortiz is a hype job, never faced a problem opponent in the ring, Benn has a grounded experience and is better prepared   for a real fight.
I'm Albanian but florian marku is a pussy boy
You eat for breakfast Florian marku
We want to see the clash of titans Benn v Khan! I'd back benn all the way to KO Khan
Needs a proper test first like the lad said.
Is this another destroyer, he certainly looks promising.
It's all fun and games till he steps in with real competition
He wants khan come on, you won't know what hit ya
People saying that the stoppage was early are blind. The only outcome was Vargas going to sleep brutally. Fast, but justified stoppage. He had no answers for Benn's onslaught
some boy like
Was this a premature stoppage? No criticism of the referee as 26 unanswered shots is always going to lead to him having having this decision to make, and Vargas was clearly hurt but was he *that* hurt?  It's a tough one. He seemed ok immediately after the stoppage but watching him take an absolute onslaught with some very heavy shots repeatedly getting through, it was surely just a matter of time?
Hes ducking florian marku
Should never have been stopped
I enjoyed that!
Wow future legend?
I watched his very first debut fight and he was impressive then... I liked his confidence and ability but this was unforeseen he’s a fantastic fighter and will be a champion!
Early stoppage
WOW just Wow
If all boxers fought with that killer instinct more people would watch the sport 👀problem is most the time it goes the distance & gets boring
My goodness was that vicious 😱
He kills Khan in 1
I knew before even watching that the ref would stop it before the guy went down, recurring thing with British refs
Power and precision
By the way its TKO not KO sky sports  and I think that should've went a bit longer
Apple don't fall far from the tree,Total class
great piece of boxing
Defo champ in the making
Hes ready for Spence and Crawford but Eddy will destroy his career with soft touches to hype him up then when it's to late to step up and he does he comes up short. Eddy does that will all these fighters
Very very sharp, powerful and clinical!
Tbh I haven't been impressed with Benn since he made his debut. But lately he's made huge improvements and he will be a world champion soon. Easily the best welterweight in the country now.
He’s the most improved fighter I’ve seen in 50 years boxing, he started out in the pro ranks, raw and amateurish, now he’s one of the biggest punching, quickest welterweights out there, heck he’s strong enough to mix it with middleweights and he’s definitely Britain’s best prospect, good luck Conor, your dad was my favourite 🇬🇧 fighter by a mile, hopefully he’ll equal and surpass his illustrious legacy 👍
God that's the first time I really looked at benn he's vicious and hits with real power future world champ I think
Ooooohhhhh
Bloody hell, power, speed and accuracy spot one 👌
That was a demolition
Vargas had no intention of winning, he didnt even bother warming up
I wish the ref would have let them fight lol
Go and fight ugas, ennis, lipinets, hooker or even Khan, but don't call out the likes of porter, spence or anyone on their level, cause they'll destroy you.
Wow never seen this guy before very impressive
Say what you want... no one has any room to underestimate this man again, Conor Benn take your hat off bruv.. VISCIOUS!!!!
This guys is a people's champion.
Very nice.
Think Vargas should have been given a bit more time he still had his head down and hands up, this is why MMA is taking over the combat sports game
The performance of the year so far for me!
Great performance, certainly made a statement there !
benn is vicious, unbelievable improvement, hes going all the way completely!
Wow impressive.
I was a massive fan of Conor's father, loved the way he fought. Conor has a lot of those qualities that made his father a World Champion, precision, strength and indomitable spirit. I seriously believe that if this young man continues to develop as he has he may well eclipse his forebear, his future is quite literally in those astonishingly quick hands. Good luck young man, I will watch with interest.
Benn jr vs Eubank jr?
Amazing performance like this and still people in the comments spell his name wrong even though it's in the title of the video 🥱
I'm all in, loved his attitude at the end, that's the fire in the belly that his dad had, if he's as good as his dad you WILL be entertained, loved watching Nigel, and feel a buzz about conor too, ALL the very best 🙏
The fight was stopped no knock down🤦‍♂️
He won’t beat Amir yet tho ... needs more time
That was some unbelievable striking from Benn fast, sharp, accurate and powerful.
Amir Kahn is toast.
“The Apple 🍎 doesn’t fall far from the tree🌲” Very impressed. Keep focussed. 😘
Put him up there!
Seeing a lot of this in the comments but I can honestly say that fiery warrior side his dad had seemed to come out in this fight, that will matter in bigger fights
We won't know how good he really is until he gets hit hard! if he has a chin like GGG then he could be pound 4 pound! Don't put him in a ring with Amir Khan, that would be cruel.
Yes conor my brother go on u licked him up hahaha
Benn in the pocket is disgusting for an opponent pure power n precision
He's definitely deserves a British or even a European title shot after that performance!
An excellent start by Conor Benn.    But seemed a little early for the stoppage.
Why no standing 8 count!? Great performance from Benn though but Vargas deserved a chance to reset
His punches look like they have sting in then.
Conor benn don’t want to call out Vergil Ortiz or jaron Ennis but old past prime Khan 😂😂😂😂
Early stoppage he was absolutely fine.. you dont stop a fight because it looks like hes taking punches you stop a fight when hes so hurt he cant defend himself, he was clear eyed an absolutely fine looking the ref in the eye in surprise it was stopped after a nice flurry.
What Amir Khan cannot do Connor Benn done in 86 seconds
Hithimonthechin
From 1:40 (video not round time). It's Conor's accuracy for me, absolutely unreal! Just before ref stops it, his punches get more powerful. Congrats man, cant wait for next fight.
Statement made.
Bloody hell that looked brutal. Forget about Khan, aim a lot higher then that
When's the Benn vs Eubanks fight they could have there dads on the same bill
Impressive he has got the attitude and the balls to match
Conor ferocious just like his dad😃😃😃
Fight Florian Marku f
Anyone else just repeating WOAAAH WOOOAAAHHH OOOHHH WOOOOOOWW
Great young fighter with a good attitude. Keep improving with a good team around you.
Benn made Vargas look like an amateur.. wow
I think ref should have give Vargas a standing count before stopping the fight.
Even the shots hitting the gloves were doing damage. No ones safe
I remember his 1st fight... his improvement is a testament to the work he's clearly been putting in... he looks really sharp now.
There’s two types of robberies, a decision and bs stoppages. Both involves the promoter and the home fighter. BS!
Benn vs Khan....would love to see Benn knock him out!
Precision, power and speed. This kid has it all
I had 2 sips out of my beer and it was OVER!! 🍻🥊💥🥊💥🥊😳
Just became a Conor Benn fan. Hard, fast, accurate and spiteful punches . Looks better everytime he goes in the ring. Ref maybe could of let it go on a tad longer. It's hard to punch back when your recieving a flurry of shots and I think Vargas may of been able to throw back if he wasn't knocked down first. Never like it when they stop a fighter on his feet when he hasn't even been down. I know it's safety and all but still think it was stopped a tad early.
Hardly a ko
What a bloody fighter! BENN is in!
Insane fighter 🔥🔥
He looked sensational there 👏
Was it worth taking that robe off 😂
Huge improvement
This is what’s wrong with british refs. They jump into too quick to give the foreign fighter a loss. Seriously need schooling on how to eye out a stoppage. Varagas was getting stopped recently by other opponents but this was not one and given his track record he is a tough veteran and was robbed a chance to see what would have happened in the later rounds. Absolute BS!
No one else think Ref stopped it too early? 🤔
Takes after his father man with they punches
Ben face Florin  Marku  first  and after  go for  Amir Khan  bout you know you gone loose  with Florian  Marku  you know that
It seemed early on live viewing but in hindsight he would've just tee'd off on Vargas until he died
Wow! That speed was amazing.
Had to watch a few times to see if stoppage might have bin premature but after the third time you can clearly see that dude got batterd
BOOOM! SHAKAA!
bad boy 💪
Can he better than Nigel benn I think he can that was spiteful
Please help me in my ability to talk to females.
That was shocking
Vargas as now won 2 of his last 7    Benn fans don’t get 2 excited   Wait until he fights someone that punches back.,    Then and only then will the truth unravel.   Good luck to Benn   But,, I’m still on the fence.🥊😎
Is this kid the real deal??? Can he overshadow what his father done in boxing??? Can't wait to see what's to come. Forget Khan, he's a washed up has been, he should be looking at special K Brook (or is Brook a step too far)?
He the real Lion in the Camp🦁
Erm the accuracy that's coming with e speed 😟
Khan was a 2 time world champion at 24
No time for messing around.. this guys going to the top.. give him the big fights! He got it all..
Man, the accuracy of those shots. Damn.
Excellent.  Benn looks really good 👊
Performance of a stone cold killer
Punishment
Poor stoppage
He got paid to take a flop. He wasnt even fighting
Load of muppet cliches comments. Matchroom feeding their fighters has been old fighters to build interest in a fighter who will get found out even before elite level. He might even get one of the Micky Mouse titles along the way. Boxing is so cringe now but good luck to the kid, just think he is so over ratted.
0:50 tough fight that was an understatement 🤫
He should fight Marco
This kid has power
Well it’s fair to say Eubank JR got no chance against this beast
Sting like a bee🐝🐝🐝🐝
That was very impressive.
If he has half the heart his dad has he's a scary man. Absolutely legit
Jees if he has that power and speed, and he’s madder than his dad, it’s all over!
Amir khan has been to Safeguard windows to strengthen his chin for his next fight. 🥊🥊🥊
On a mission and punches well on target.. he's not messing 😳
K.O?
Bullshit modern refereeing
I don't get why Vargas did not defend himself. Still well played from Benn
The advert on yt took longer than the fight. That Colombian never felt like he was into that fight from the start.
Dig out khan or brooks to see what level you are really at Connor
Vargas was à sitting duck.
Pointless fight for Benn to fight amir Kahn. Kahn's been out years surley that's just a payday for Benn. We really want to see Kel brook Kahn
Ben looked amazing. But fcuking hell how early was it to stop the fight. Boxing is getting to soft. It was round 1. The first flurry of punches and referee jumps in.
I love kendall Jenner's feet
Adam Smith “biggest fight ever for Conor benn”  30 seconds later... And it’s all over!!
I've kept an eye on benn since day one and he has silenced every doubter by just working harder a d grafting. Proper talent 🔥🔥🔥
Aadz6(ayt6F/ 6baTy innsa(
It’s funny 4/5 years ago when he started nobody thought he would get here only if you know pedigree you’ll see he was destined for this stage ..
He will lose to Florian "The Albanian King" Marku soon enough anyway.
Never liked his dad or him, trying to choose the words carefully ask Sky are in to deleting comments & censoring
Khan won’t go near him
Amir Khan is a 💩 fighter! Don’t compare the 2!
Absolute savage... That was a proper beat down!
Brilliant 🙏
Rapid hands & amazing power for his weight . What a show by Benn! 🔥 💥
Early stoppage?
Way too early to stop it!!! Yes he was hurt, but that’s like saying you want to swim and not get wet. Particularly, the fact that Vargas is known to be durable. However, Connor looked sharp and I see the improvement and poise.
warrior
Fight Florian next🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱
Everybody will be talking about Connor Benn after this fight. Khan won't fight him now. You're looking at the next Welterweight World Champion, right here.
Looks like English boxing is about the come back in fine style .  just a shame it never went on a few more rounds so we really get to see him in action
Good boxing , but why is Ben wearing a skirt ?😊🤓😂
Anyone know why he speaks with a Londoner accent when he grew up in Australia?
Anybody who thinks benn would beat amir is living in dream land .
Benn vs Eubank jr
amazing.....KO???? should of gone to spec savers mate
Early stoppage , should have been a standing count
Massively improved. Don't forget Benn is super lucky to still be undefeated and looked really average in some of his earlier fights. If he keeps progressing, he could challenge for a world title if they don't rush him.
Outstanding 🥊Big  Benn junior Is going all the way 💥
Always knew benn jr would be better then his da
Benn looked sharp and strong, nice jab, looks the part....... Poor stoppage imo.
Wow that was ferocious.
Some improvements  looks the real deal now.
😁🥊🥊🥊🥊.. proud of you connor benn
That is the first fight where his combinations and super fast hand speed reminds me of Nigel. Very impressive indeed.
Looked absolutely mint then absolutely ruined it at the end with the big headed rant. Humility is a quality admired.
Called way to early. This a fight!! Whats the point if the sport become so sensitive
Shouldn’t of been stopped in my opinion should’ve gave him a standing 8 count as acted as if he got knocked down
JUST LIKE HIS DAD!
Stopped UK judges and refs are sad
Fair play. He has just turned my head.  Great performance, His Dad is my idol and don't think he will be as good.. BUT after that performance I'll definitely be watching him. Well done conner 👊👍
Benn is a very good fighter but I mean that was stopped early at least let Vargas hit the floor and try to get back up, what happened to that nowadays they just stop the fight when it looks good
Excellent well done that was sweet stuff.
That was some performance. Hell of a stoppage. Nice 1.
Ref is a pussy should have let it go longer
tank, Lopez, and garcia next
He was so cocky in the interview after
Lots of comments on the stoppage...too soon or just right? I think four factors are worth considering:  (1) Look at the stoppages in UFC. They are cutting out a LOT of extra "ground and pound" comparitive to the earlier years. At the same time, we are seeing more "walk away" KO's, perhaps BECAUSE the victorious fighter knows he's done enough to get the stoppage?  UFC (and the othe organisations) are a SERIOUS contender for a finite number of people who want to pursue combat sports professionally.   (2) Either way, a protected fighter can take a rematch. It's easy to argue that Vargas was a second away from a stunning counter, or whatever version of events you might like to construct...but ask yourself this: If a friend of yours at school got into a fight and was losing like this, would you have waited to step in? Or would you have said "he got you this time, there's always tomorrow"  (3) No crowd noise. Referees are human beings and the roar of the crowd is hard to block out. In a quiet arena the ref's perceptions are entirely focussed AND enhanced by the fact that he can hear can hear the breathing of the losing fighter, hear the sound of the blows. A ref standing on one side can't be sure how clean a hook to the OTHER side landed...or did it hit the glove?   Sometimes, when we watch clips of beatings that clearly went on too long, the only credible explanation (other than sadism) is that the referee has stopped officiating momentarily and is watching, along with the baying crowd.  (4) I really belive that a rule change would be good for boxing: The three point round. Instead of boxing for three minutes, this round could have been stopped at the time the ref went in.Three points to Benn. We would still see fights ended by clean knockouts, but no more pummeling knockouts which, in my non-medical opinion, do far more damage long term.  In order for this to work, I'd have four doctors watching. If three press a button, the ref gets the nod from his earpiece (nearly every other sports' ref wears one) and the crowd are alerted by a Lights system. Then the ref have the final say, but the OK to do it was not his (potentially biased and or bribed) decision.
Not a ko
He just beat  a punching bag Beating fighters who past their prime and have 4-5 loses doesn't tell me nothing.  I would to see him  how he cope against the likes of Crawford or Spence or even Porter.
Marku will slap up Connor!!
Nice a fighter who knows when to go for the kill
He shows no respect in the ring. This is how he will go far and could actually demolish some of the big names. He has no fear. He has the engine and the skills. Very exciting.
What a class of boxing 👏
This kid is the real deal, apple doesn't fall far from the tree plus he can box !
He did well once he got the opening there he went for the kill..... but I must stay the stoppage was earlier let it go on and see it wasn't as if he was KO or stumbling around he was still standing just took a few hard shots
Wow. He's gonna destroy everyone. You ever seen such fast hands? World champion in no time!
Stopped too early.
Wow that was fast like he’s old man he can proper bang some quality shots hooks and uppercuts and Vargas ain’t no mug either result Conor benn 🤜🏻🤜🏻
The way he slowed the assault to eye him up and re positon before continuing the assult again was very Tysonesque.  Very impressive finishing from Benn
I know I'm saying what everyone else is but 3 years ago he was a decent fighter. This benn looks world class. This is hard work more than natural talent
I honestly thought benn lost that
Shouldn’t have been stopped .
Khan's got not chance
This guy will get knocked out soon. He’s fat too arrogant. He’s ok but when he gets in with the likes of world class welterweights then lights out.
What a load of BS. Vargas was never in the process of going down or being unable to defend himself when the referee stopped the fight.
What a win, improved unbelievable and constantly with complete dedication. He’s got that real vicious streak like his dad. I turned over while the ring walk was on turned back 2 mins later and it was finished😂! Well done Connor Benn, really good interview with him on Bunce and Costelllo BBC.
Animal 🔥
New Conner wa rapid an let me say ppl think his dad wa good this lad can b a killer way now it all last night killer don’t think Khan or brook will want any this broner will b a good fight not Earl Spencer to quick for Earl  trust me looks like England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 have a real fighter who will take 🥊 to give a 🥊 respect Conner Ben 🔥🔥🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿✌️👍🏻🤞🏻
That speed, power and accuracy. Woooow.
Excellent performance. Benn needs to keep his ego in check, and stay on this steady, destructive path up to the top 10.
Bad intentions there lol.
Can't stop watching it masterclass that 1
Bloody hell! He’s definitely a chip off the old block. Got to be the best prospect out there now. That was savage and perfect.
I love Benn but it is a real bad time two be in welterweight devision so many good fighters at the top
Stopped far to early !
Shouldn't have been stopped
Early stoppage.. ref should of let the fight settle, would of been good for Ben
Try  with Florian Marku  how fast u are.. 🙏🙏
Stopped to early  Stop comparing vargas performance against spence or khan. Put conner in against spence and see what happens. He's been pro 5 years Spence was champion in that time Benns are living of the old mans name
THE LEGEND CONTINUES
Wow. Benn. Eubank.  Like father like son... chris won't come near to his dad. Benn very may well.
Please put him in with bronner id love to see him slap him about
Bust him up Benn, they must of forgot who your dad is, and the apple dont fall far from the tree.
Its the accuracy of the punches that is so impressive here. Watch it at half speed. he is simply not missing .Very significant performance
Mans on job vast improvements made, I still don’t know if he wins a title while Bud and Errol are around but he’s above domestic level.
Happy he won and looks to have improved a lot but did that warrant a stoppage he took a few shots but that seemed a bit of a quick call
Where's this KNOCKOUT then?
Like the way he stepped back and selected his shots towards the end, looks really good
Ref made right decision 100%
Yeah he is class. will be the best in division
Beast
Well done to him looks like a beast. BUT personally i dont like to see refs stopping fights like this. Knockout is when you knock someone out. too early
Put the punches together really well good stoppage.  Hopefully he doesn’t try to run 2 soon.
The handspeed at 1:10 Is incredible and he puts venom in every punch he throws very entertaining to watch
O m f g ..... s h i t fight
That’s right give the man hype however, when he steps up to the elite American/Mexican level he will get schooled like most Brits. He need to improve his fundementals. No point taking on over the hill Khan’s/Brooks needs to step up Danny Garcia’s, Shawn Porters etc who are just beneath elite
Very very impressed by this fighter, good to watch fast powerful punches.👍👍👍
Wow, what an improvement in him, what a display of precision punching. I had him down as a decent but fairly limited fighter overhyped due to his name. Happy to see I was wrong, on this evidence the lad has a great chance of reaching the top
What a beast
Benn jnr has changed slightly for the best  He was so much like his dad power power power and in some ways was trying to be his dad or show him I can do what you did sometimes  a name can be a downfall of a son of a famous boxer  I think they his team or dad have said less power more control look box but take a opening as soon as you see it Power is good but if it’s all you rely on and you meet a fighter who can withstand it and box you your in trouble it happened to benn Snr  IE mr Michael whatson  Mr Christopher Eubank  If ever a son has suffered for a family name and expectations it’s Eubank jnr he’s still young enough to change be his own boxer
Savage. Blew him away is right. UK may be going through its golden era right now. The best fighters in the heavy and lightweight divisions anywhere in the world.
Said ages ago this kid is class,  now people will Start to make up excuses that sammy no good etc it would wipe the floor with kelly
Savage. What a prospect.
Benn will get some great fights after this, Vargas looked like he didn't want to be there.
Tank next that's the one
wasn’t convinced on benn until this performance, he’s gonna be huge at world level
I honestly thought this fight was gonna be a war! Fair play to Conor!
Reff is joke lol
Early stoppage
That was bloody good. I came here with a bit of scepticism but that right hand is fast and hard. Well done Conor Benn.
Benns hands are vicious. Even his jab is potent. Respect for vargas. Gracious in defeat.
*kevin Hart voice* Nooo... nooooo... he wasn’t ready😢, HE WASN’T READY😩😂
He is also good looking. Ladies are gonna be all over him.
Damnnn sharp and vicious
The second he saw Vargas slightly wobble he instantly threw the upper cut which is a killer instinct 🥊
Wow, what a performance! So aggressive, powerful and devastatingly accurate. Did the ref step in too early though? Perhaps Vargas could have shown more in the way of defence as he was far too open. KO was inevitable, so good decision by ref in my opinion.
People crying about an early stoppage🤣 He took close to 25 punches without throwing back😭
Massive credit to Benns improvements bit that was an early stoppage. Had it been a couple of rounds in a 1 sided fight fsir enough but you cant just stop a fight afrer a boxer gets jit a coulple of time.
Too fast too powerful, Vargas didn’t want it after the first shot
Just need's to humble himself and lose some attitude when he is victorious. Great fighter.
Animal
The son of a Ilford boy done good. Big up Dane and loxford. And Ilford palais
Got his dads power, great improvement. One to watch.
Yes Connor Benn top performance Ruthless!!!
British referees stop fights way to early
At least let the man take a knee. The fight had only just started, he hadn't taken any damage. That was rubbish, I'm going to watch some UFC.
Load of muppets on The Ring page saying it was an early stoppage. Not in my book, the ref did the right thing. Not ready for some of the names he mentioned post fight, but massively improved from even 18 months ago.
Well done quality boxing
The way he hits reminds me of someone,  chip off the old block 💪🏿
Good performance but ref could gave him a standing 8 count let him clear his head a bit the man was bobbing still on his feet. Definitely a early stoppage. Not sure but I think the ref was on a promise the way he was looking at Vargas
Woooy playing no games straight banged him
“Knockout” 🤨
Brilliant display of speed, power and accuracy. Impressive stuff!
Premature stoppage
He didn’t knock him out he stopped him. First get it right sky please
Stop everybody ,Vargas is not a great boxer.if youre a true boxing fan stop watching sky .the commentary is so bad and one sided it's a joke .benn is good but sky will place him beside Ali.Eddie could sell sand to an arab and "it's the best sand in the world" joker.
This is the best round I have seen that displays all the fundamentals of jabs and power rights. Damn its like everything my boxing coach told me executed down to the tee
I wanna see more of him. I'm impressed with him more than Eubank junior. Ben has never disappoint. 👍🏿
Knockout?
Vargas was eating punches
wow, didn't see that coming.....neither did Vargas. Khan ain't gonna want any if that. Impressive Coner, you gonna go far.
Throws every punch with bad intensions. But that kind of pace and full blooded swinging....how long can he fight like that? Four rounds? And he caught the guy flush a lot, 15 heavy clean shots, but didn't drop him. I know it's early and he's a resilient guy. But you catch someone that clean, that many times you gotta expect to drop him. It's a fantastic performance but there are still questions. Puts himself in the conversation though.
Jesus anyone else think the ref let it carry on a few punches too long those were sledgehammers
Put some respek on his name!
Hmm. Can he be another Eubank though 👀👀 hopefully not. Massive fan of his dad.
Premature stoppage, as it was round 1 ref should have given him a standing 8. Benn did what he needed to though, looking sharp af
Benn kills Marku
Savaaaaagggeeeee
*EVERYONE* - You have been trained and tricked into drinking alcohol since you were 17.  Alcohol is a toxic drug, poisonous, and cancerous. No celebs drink or barely do, even though they may trick you into drinking.  Alcohol is good for business profits, the government taxes and the medical profession as it makes people sick. 100s die everyday due to alcohol, 1000s are disabled with pancreatitis, liver/heart disease etc which is not reported!  Alcohol controls population numbers.
Stoppage no knock out still good though
Complete and utter domination.
Fair play he looked good, you can certainly see his father in him.
Hmmm !
Watch the fight again...and count the hard punches he took before It was stopped. I counted 15.
The accuracy and power is so improved wow, what a performance!!
Wish adam smith would stfu
Reminded me of his dad ther for the 1st time. Spiteful punches and real aggression
That was a standing count not a stoppage ffs
Brilliant! 👏👏👏😉👍🥊💥
Did he miss one punch? Had no idea he was capable of that. Absolutely vicious, clinical performance. What an improvement.
If the ref never stopped it Vargas would of been knocked out the ref would of been criticized about not stopping it
Imagine coming to fight for 82 seconds 💀
Fast and clean......but one round is not boxing!
Sum1 just  got Ko :P
Ref saved him from some serious damage there
Benn is the real deal. We are always eager to see what additions he has made to his craft as he always displays a lot of improvement from fight to fight. We were hoping to see more of that. Naaah. Bombs away !
People get real this guy was a walking punchbag, he took a big beating last time out,which didn't do him any good a fighter can only take so many beatings and yes the punches were crisp and sharp but benn was 1-16 to win the fight so what happened should have happened and I backed 1st round 30-1 and rounds 1-3 at 7-1 everyone is getting a bit carried away it was easy money, no surprises here and I know everyone will start moaning at what I have said and I know conor has had no amateur experience but before you can start raving get the euro title and then we will know whether conor benn has got what it takes to fight for a world title never mind win one and finally their ain't no need to go for the British title because that would be a backward step
His hand speed is crazy not many fighters will be able to keep up with him
Who’s laughing now Kelly .
Florian marku next
Fast, accurate, powerful and clinical.   That was mighty impressive.  I'm excited to see where he goes from here.
Forget khan , benns ready for the Garcia's and porters ....time is now he has age on his side
Impressive
Wonder how long Kahn’s glass jaw would last ?  Wishing Conor a very bright career 👍
Looking crisp and powerful 👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Stick him in with GGG
Fight that kid that beat Kelly that AVNISAYAN
Eubank will smash you
Fast as F and stronger legs than his dad. No reason he can't win the belt.
Thanks for the spoiler title, as always!
That made me shout out wow
If he wants a test why call out Amire Khan hes got a glass jaw 🤷‍♂️
Better boxer than his dad, but just a spiteful a puncher at times too.
Let's not forget vargas is ranked 125th in the world. Impressive stoppage tho
Boy, Those were some clean licks from Benn. LoL!!!
Brilliant performance & I hope Conor becomes a world champ. Great & exciting fighter, already!
Superbly executed, well done!
Horrible stoppage
Shades of his old man there
Think the ref jumped in a bit quick there.
Just a shame this sport now involves Logan Paul 🤣🤣boxing literally been ruined in the last 10-15 years. UFC is much more entertaining and doesn’t feature YouTube’s
referee should have given him more time let him go down at least  c if hes shaky wen hes up its only da 1st minute but he acted like its ufc
Nigel Benn no 2, about to bring back them glorious nights again,  give it to them yanks ,love to see it in the future the likes of crawford or spence getting it 😀
Where's Khan
Way too much power for Vargas great stoppage from the ref.
Like Father... Like Son... Beast!
Wow just wow 🇬🇧🇬🇧
The improvement from Benn is unreal
Made a good fighter look like it was sparring session! Fast hands, exciting future. 🥊🥊 🏆
Errol Spence would destroy him.
No count?
That was genuinely impressive... great control of distance, accuracy and what I’d call applied power.. also good defence, pawing the jab and keeping at range, when he threw a chopping right he bought the same hand back up to defend, very nice. Finishing was excellent... he seems to have nigels spite and heart but a smarter overall package.
ANIMAL
Thats bullshit. Allow vargas to gather his composure before stopping the fight. He could of recovered he never went down. Refs stopping fights like this let's just stop boxing altogether.  Credit to benn but come on thats a soft stoppage and definitely not a knock out
Very quick hands great accuracy
Wow  He's ready now.  Khan chin will be shattered after those type of shots.
Very impressive ,,
fight was stopped far to early
should have atleast gave him an 8 count
He is literally improving.
What an amazing display, prospect to world beater in 82 seconds. I can't believe the meteoric rise in this guy's skill level.
Shame he's not middleweight. .I'd love to see him beat eubank Jr. .👊 and as for amir Khan, 😂😂😂..don't miss too close to him, the wind may just blow him over 😂😂😂
Impressive. Forget khan he’s on his way out to be fair. Avenesyan would be a great fight. Not sure why khan and brook think a fight between the 2 is box office. Both on their last legs
He got Hit Different 💭
Future world champion for sure. Unreal combination of power, speed and precision.
This is conor at his best and is only going to improve , please bring on Khan he won't stand a chance
Who was he swearing at the end of the fight?
Mate you are the real deal Connor 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Razor sharp
Bonner Ken!
Got to.give benn credit he started with his father's names now he's turned into a legit fighter who can now challenge the top guys he's come on loads.
Well done benn well done ref  😂 terrible stoppage
Stoppge a tad premature
Vargas should of threw a shot or two back he seemed shell shocked made the ref make a decision esrly cos them shots were hard but throw some back or clinch didnt retaliate once
Good fighter so far, hes got a career ahead of him. As good as his father? probably not
Wow 👏
Conor has that fire inside him. Focused. Vicious.
Conor blew vargas away with ease 🥊  he should be fighting for a world title very soon 🥊🥊
Fantastic work
That was sick !!!! Well done
Amazing display of raw power, talented !!!
I hope he's not going to be one of those who says far too much after winning as he will look very silly one day when he gets put on his arse. Khan will have no chance against him, his glass jaw will shatter from a near miss of one of his jabs
Class
This is someone special, power speed unreal
Ben looked great but that was a poor poor stoppage ! Vargas was still stood up a thought in boxing you hit the floor then got a 10 count or did the rules change all of a sudden ??? poor refereeing in my opinion ! but hey....a wins a win👍🏻
Bad intentions
Fantastic performance but that was an early stoppage
The hot prospect is starting to come alive with that ferocity, exactly what's been missing in boxing nowadays
Kudos to the referee, saved Vargas from brain damage!
He'll smoke Khan the way he don't it last night absolute animal 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Chip off the block. Good man
Stopped too early.
Fook me nigel,what ve u created here,,even im proud n he aint mine,,hats off to you conner,now thats a pure breed
Wow🤯🤯
The referee was 'spot on' with the stoppage. He allowed Samuel the challenge but it was not coming.
First fight I ever saw was Nigel Benn Vs Nicky Piper. Now seeing his son absolutely destroy it. Full circle
Bit early but a few more of them shots could have seriously hurt him.... didn’t learn much but improving fast give him the dude who beat Kelly that would be a statement
AND ON TONIGHTS WOULD YOU SPILL HIS PINT........
Wow speed
Keep khan away from that boy.
Scary hand speed that
Never thought I Would I want to buy everlast Gloves lol
That was impressive WW division put on notice.
It’s not just speed and power, it’s the pin point accuracy of his shots. Doubt you’ll find many as hungry or committed as Conner. Long may it continue 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
WTF. That was quick one 👏
That was a bit of a 'British' stoppage but he was taking big hits and not really defending himself.  The irony is that if he had have gone down he would have been allowed to continue.
Strong 💪 strong boy!!!!!
Why does he keep giving the event staff a bollocking when he wins? 🤣
Benn is a different level to Eubank
That’s crazy 😜
Poor from the Ref, see too much of that in the UK/sky sports events. Wouldn’t be happy if I were Vargas but Benn looked sharp. It could have been a good fight.
Bloody SENSATIONAL, hooks, jabs, uppers - too quick to count!!! What a win!!! Well done!😉😉😉 1:42
Damn what an improvement he had made
Thought the ref could've given a standing  8 instead of stopping it so early
let the man go out on his back give him the count at least ref shoudnt of stopped it
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Great performance don't get carried away vargas didn't throw a punch Khan and Co will great game plan by simms they went for a quick start early finish no one will want to fight benn
Wow  that kid has got some speed and power.. well done conor benn.
Good to see anyone to excel in their chosen field, sometimes even more impressive when sometimes maybe over shaddowed. I was a Eubank Snr fan when younger as I'm a Brightonian.   Well done.
Benn=world champ within 2 years simple.
He’s improvement already is 👌🏻
Froch v Bute springs to mind.
looks more like he got reffere on his side as vargas could continue without a single problem ...!
Even boxers now look like newspaper
What a performance man what a fella
Why the hell did the ref stop the fight so quickly
There’s gotta be someone better than “The Glass Chin” next for Benn.
He’s going to be a good fighter but Vargas  isn’t in the top 100 so can’t judge him on this fight. Vargas was good but past it now.
Great fighter. Shame he is not not more humble.....not a likable individual at all
Wow didn't see that coming so soon in round 1 🙆well done C. B 🥊👍💯
I’m not putting a downer on Connors performance, but you can’t say that wasn’t an early stoppage..
Sure has his old man's  aggression speed power and loves a tear up😊 Benn  ko Khan in the lst rd
The speed and power was amazing, Cannot wait to see his next fight.
Am I the only one that thinks it was an early stoppage? Standing eight perhaps?
Great commentating from  the get go again..... 'will be a tough learning fight for benn' 🤷‍♂️🤣
No joke, i went for a piss and the fight was finished
He needs to fight young Eubanks with there dads in the corners  Now that would be great
Beats up an old journeyman and people are saying he’s going to be a world champion?
khan v benn be like watching in fast forward.  rapiddd
Gosh, I don't watch a lot of boxing. This is one of the most violent looking knockouts I've ever seen. Looks harsher than UFC
Well done Conor, fast sharp and powerful..
Come on! If this was a MMA fight and stop it like that, the fans would be pissed.  He didn’t go down and the fight was 1.30 mins in. 😂 oh boxing you dieing breed
I rate Connor very highly but they should of let it go on for a little longer Vargas was not a journey man. Connors jab is becoming a real problem and his speed is increasing massively. His dad was my favourite fighter and connors following suit.
Why is he so angry? Lol
This fight just made him a PPV star
Early stoppage
YIKES!
I've always backed  Benn. Great performance 🥊🥊
Well impressed.  Looked fast, spiteful and controlled.  This guy's going places.
As sharp as Anyone I’ve seen in the ring
Just hope and pray Connor doesn't have a tragedy that befell his dad when he fought McClellan.
Is it me or does it look like it was staged?
Wonder if Jake cringe Paul thinks he can win this lad too, send him a contract, fight a proper boxer not a tea lady.
It was like a boy vs a man in there congratulations Conor Benn
Wow soooo impressed it’s in the blood welldone 😎
Should fight Josh kelly next
These referees are way too quick to jump in, some of the best matches ever would not have happened if these clowns had their way.
Why dose Connor benn look like a created fighter in ufc
Chris eubank Jr vs Connor Benn in the future
That is BS!!! You have to let the fighter get dropped in Round 1 before you stop that is insane. All rookie's blow their load in round 1 like that to look good but they don't look anything like that in rounds 2, 3, 4 and onwards. That's an absolutely awful decision. I would be fuming.
🤯😳😱👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
O.M.F.G Connor ben 2.0, dispatched vargas with absolute zero respect. 🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥
Should not of been stopped The fix was in!
Bit early stoppage
Damn he's improved !!!
Like father, like son. Makes Amir look like a hairdresser !
Wow the speed of Connor this guys the real deal
Incredible stoppage, looks as sharp as a tack with serious power behind every shot 👏
Class act
Went in there with confidence and something to prove. If he carries on like this he could be a very popular fighter
what a performance,nice and nasty
Why wear a skirt
Two words to describe this fight: POWER, PRECISION.
10 stone this weight devision is surely for little boys. Last time I weighed that I was about 12 😂😂😂.
Some performance that.
The speed and accuracy was unbelievable and he is absolutely ruthless, I think he’s gonna go all the way, but who will wanna fight this guy?😂 i can’t exactly see the big boys asking for this fight
Pile o SHITE
Was it just me or has conor benn started morphing into his dad ? Got huge confidence now
The apple never falls far from the tree
That was brutal
looks so improved.
Late from ref there.
Another hype train. Lol
What a statement
His dad nigel. Disabled a guy in fight. Boxing is no joke and this guy is onit
😂😂as if the ref stopped that ... can’t rate benn on that sorry just can’t .. ref should have let it carry on
Wooooo that was amazing! Benn needs a real test now.
Good performance but what wtf is wrong with a standing count? Stopped to early
Wow! Connor's come on leaps and bounds! Looking forward to his future as a World Champ!
Wow the kid is sharp 🔥🔥🔥. Definitely one to watch . Well done Conor 👌🏿
Shut up Adam Booth post fight, we want to hear what Conor Benn is saying
I was shocked watching this at night yesterday. I thought he was gonna get caught coming in the same way Amir Khan did. I hate to say it but he’s exactly like his dad. Completely disregards who he’s fighting and just tries to dismantle them.
stopped way too soon
Jesus that was speed
Thought he was good but after that he’s ready for them yanks would love to see him fight Errol spence
Wow! Now that is how to school a fight...
Wow benn’s hands were like lightening 👌🏽 great prospect for the future of British boxing
Son of a legend who knows he nay surpass his dads achievements
Mannnnnnn, that was so reminiscent to his father. That was such a vicious fight. Dare I say, Conor is ready for a world title shot?
Conor Benn on levels with enough experience I think he could be tough against canelo
That Conour Ben can bang 👊🏾 cold ❄️
Poor stoppage. Benn looks good though.
From a handful of fights in, if you followed him you could see the hunger and desire, just depended upon whether he'd got a chin, and could learn and grow... he hasn't half! Super performance, all the shots, footwork and feints, Tony Sims team bringing Conor on a treat! I hope they stay together. I think get the British, then European at the end of the year, if the fights can be made. Go for a stateside name in spring '22. He'd demolish Khan, Brook a harder fight but yes winnable (you never know which KB version will turn up). Massive respect to Conor, he's gonna get his chance at a world title such is the talent and dedication. The kid's the cat's tits!
i feel like the ref shouldve gave a standing 8 count? although he was not firing back his legs were still solid and maybe shouldve had the standing 8 then see if he wants it and see if he throws back after that, if not then stop it. either way great performance from conor benn ! didnt see his stopping vargas that quick.
At least 10 good headshots unblocked and more coming as he is trapped on the ropes. He was still dazed from the first one. Should have taken a knee.
Wow that was utterly Ruthless I don’t think I’ve seen  a boxer with that much Speed accuracy and power . He has one hell of a future. Amazing to watch
Good footwork,in out.He went head hunting this time but if he added body shots to his arsenal for next fight like left to body right uppercut  that would knacker his opponent out.Definately liked the way he was using footwork to avoid getting hit in first round , shows he's focused.
Wrong to spot it in my view, wayyyyy too eqrly
Bad man 💪🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Wow
I watched his dad as KID on tv with excitement with  my dad now I will take my dad to to see connor 1st title fight .  This lad is something else 🥊 Best of luck WE are all behind you mate
I think he’s ready now for a world title fight, that was brutally explosive and world class level finishing.
Come on he could have at least let him get cut or hit the floor at least once. I hate reffing like that
Destruction.
great commentary looooool.
Don't get too carried away, the guy was very poor, Benn is  good, Vargas is over the hill.
What a beast this geeza has turned quality ! 🔝
Stopped too early there but 👏 to benn good accuracy with his punches  well timed.
Shades of the old man there
Stopped to early.
Bit of a premature stoppage that?
Who is Samuel Vargas?
Benn looks good until he fights someone who'll hit him back and he will be another khan
Sensational 👍💪
My lord, that snap and speed
That jab, hand speed and sharpness was incredible... Khan’s chin wouldn’t be able to withstand that surely?
He would have won anyway Vargas too many miles on the clock. Fight still stopped a little early
Absolute joke of a stoppage.
Throw him in with the other Conor ... Mcgregor , same weight same personas
Vergil Ortiz jr would KO Benn.
Vargas way past his best
Did the commentator say, ‘this is the man that went 12 rounds with Amir Khan’ as a positive statement.
Cheers g we won bucks
Unbelievable!
A man that went 12 rounds with amir Khan 😆🤣😂 o he must be good then lol
Not a knockout though is it 🤔
Anybody else think it was stopped prematurely? Yes he was speedy powerful and accurate and im not taking that away from him however I feel the ref was way to fast to stop it, or just me?
Wow
The ko’s in boxing just aren’t as spectacular to watch compared to those in UFC.
Accurate and vicious. He’s very good off his jab
Bad ref give a standing 8 count how can you stop a 12 round fight after a minute I've watched boxing my whole life and I'm done
Wow. I thought he was a bit of a hype job (Benn), and not like his dad (similar to Chris Eubank Jnr). I suppose this only tells us that he is a hard punching fighter in the early rounds, and doesn't really tell us much about how his defence has improved (which is what I really wanted to see). But, you can't ask for anything more than a first round stoppage to prove a point, against your biggest test so far. Well done.
Think I blinked once and missed like 10 punches from benn
Don’t know how much having the name Benn helped but this guy can box box !
Slightly early ref, vargas can take that sort of thing has done before
Title is wrong! This isn’t a KO lol
Love that pin pont accuracy,,,  hes got attitude. Love it! Hope he jeeps improving. Will be an interesting career to watch. Good young Ben
Massive improvement since he laboured past that French guy over two fights, very impressive. Side note - that 'music' they play during the refs instructions is a joke.
😳😳😳😳
Very fast viscous display, this guy is no mug but Conor caught him fast and cold referee had no option. Benn is improving greatly, still not convinced this fight gave the answers. Well done Conor, no wonder Eddie is cash grinning.
Early stoppage
Conner fights just like his dad 👊
Fights a nobody and calls out a washed up fighter who's not fought in years for a money fight! Matchroom I wanna fight benn
Stopped too Early
Video should just be a gif
bit of an early stoppage I think
Ref stopped it too early in my eyes vargas is an experienced fighter who was just wobbled
Conor Benn showed he can switch it on when it matters. I always thought he might be one of those fighters who turn it on in the hardest fights but sort of under performs against lower tier opponents. Good win.
Theres a new destroyer in the benn family step forward connor what a win
Watch it back at 0.25 speed, devastating, well done Conner. Vargas did well to stay up but should have taken a knee. A couple more fights cautious fights and he should fight for a title.
Benn hits harder then all of them power 🥊🥊
He ain't playing.... that's for damm sure 😂😆🙈💪
Connor Benn v eubank jr next 🤔🤷‍♂️
European title challenge next ???
Wonder if Josh Kelly still fancies it..??
Why would you want to fight khan next though? Looking forward to seeing him fight again but against someone current, Khan fight is a pointless risk
Dare I say this too early in his career, but he looked a bit like his Dad then. Aggressive & relentless.
Amazing speed and power. Conor Benn is the man to watch... Well Done Conor.... Cracking fight
Amazing Spence got someone else to start ducking now lol.
Vicious like his dad but a better boxer unreal
Mate!! 😳 I don’t think I’ve ever seen 100% punch accuracy with 100% punch power in any fight! What a performance
Wow better than his dad already!!!!
Fury Joshua likes please
Beast
Pure heart
Got his old man in him and then some...
This man ain’t a joke
I can see a lot of Nigel In this, well done Benn
Vargas: round one 1 feel him out ...benn..: nah
Excellent footwork. Killer instinct.  I'm impressed
If they stopped a fight like that, while hes standing but hurt back in the day during the first round there would be riots hahaa
Look fast crisp sharp and powerful. But big improvements from conor. He's definitely going the whole way.  Well done 🔥
Jesus the adverts I watched at the beginning was longer then this fight damn
Another gomez.... Sanchez..
He looks fast and accurate
Btw people need to put some 'respec' on Amir's name. Too many casuals about.
Should of let him get the ko just another 10 seconds
Wow sharp hard precise
This was good match making not exactly a step up. Funny how no ones mentioning David Avanesyan as a potential opponent. Khan is at the end of his career, but it will be again good match making not a step up. But fair do's to Benn he's improved considerably, hope he doesn't get deluded though after this performance.
Damn! He wasn't messing about. Them over the pond will be watching with bated  eye's
Someone tell me of a current boxer with faster hand speed than Benn, I’ll wait...
They say the apple dont fall far from the tree! Awesome display from Benn👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
That’s the name of the the game ,get them out quick .great display Connor .god bless .
Daym! He’s put the division on watch! He would KO Amir Khan easily
Said all along he’ll win Khan wouldn’t be able to cope with benn
Very slick
British refereeing at its finest
1.57 damn she's hot.
Canelo be good.
well done to the ref. probably bought vargas another few years in the ring. it was the first round and he got an absolute beating. his chances of recovering and winning plummeted heavy. chances are if he continued he'd have taken some serious damage what probably would have ended his career a lot sooner.   he gets to fight another day. frankly though, he should have taken a knee and reset the fight and got some composure back.
😑😤  ref stoped it too early 🤷🏾‍♂️  Vargas didn't even throw a punch
Great win Conor, best jab in the division . Hope the Khan fight happens, think Khan running scared 🥊👍
Next opponent should be Chris Eubank Jnr.
Wish I could spare the cash to watch live boxing.
What happened to the standing count?
Power.... He's better than his dad.. I bet nigel agrees.. Ya still my favourite boxer nigel
Wow 💣💣💣💣💣💣
Sorry stopped way to early
Terrible stoppage.
He tore into him
Benn vs brook?
Definitely his dads son well done your smash Khan. 👍🇬🇧
What a belter he is.
Now that’s fast and precise !!
God dam this is pure savagery right here from Conor Benn ⚔ .. Bless up .✌📿🥊
Nigel has just stepped into his slippers... his son has just stepped into his illustrious shoes. 🥊 🥊
Now that’s how you finish a fight! 👍🏻👊🏻
Hugely impressive.
that guy lost his lat match and got a title shot, how?
great win, happy for him but stopped way too early.
Chip off the old block .
Vargas is shot to pieces anyway but there is no way the ref would of jumped in if it was the other way round. Early stopoage
My new favourite boxer. His hunger and viscousness is exactly what brings eyes to boxing. Deserves everything he earns 🥊
Early stop
He reminds me of someone lol! Jeez that was impressive!
yo listen I didn't even see some of those punches. he gets it from his dad
That Right hand will knock n e bod out 🥊
Future champ 🙌🗡
Tough old sport, imagine having 12 rounds of that. I'll sit on my sofa and watch thanks....
Nothing against Benn but that was a ridiculous stoppage. Vargas wasnt down and he didnt look out on his feet.
Please get a Benn v Eubank fight...maybe at Super Welterweight or a catch weight!!!
Brilliant following in your dad's footsteps 👊
Vargas looked half asleep with a glass chin
Play it back in 0.25 speed to see the damage he done. My days. Great job Conor.
Wicked love it Conner Ben and his trainer make a fantastic combination.
Stopped too early, should've given a standing count
But why did the ref stop the fight his legs was steady he could of carried on Smh
Lets not get carried away !   Styles make fights ! Vargas just a slow punch bag!   In the welter division he got monsters like crawford, porter, spence , thurman and Ennis!   Personally i think he don’t beat any of the above and Amir khan/ kell brook aint giving him the opportunity !
I think Connor is fantastic but wasn't that stopped too early? No standing 8 count...FAR TOO EARLY!
I wanna see benn vs Eubank jr please
Super Welter and fight Mcgregor
Love his movement and how his shots flow with veracity. I loved his father and I am enjoying watching Conor carry the Benn legacy on.
love it, wallop, my man he's special this kid watched  boxing for 25 years
Premature stopage? 🤷🏽‍♂️
Doesn't anyone else think the referee should of let it go for another 30 seconds?
100% 🥊💣💥💤💤 now he  wants the real smoke 🚬
He was gonna win anyways but I think the ref stopped the fight a little bit pre mature
Benn and gone
What a performance 👏
No one talking about That "Sweet Upper cut "...2 Sweet Onez' ... got Good Fast Hands & please dont ask me if I know anything about boxing
WOW
At first I thought it may have been an early stoppage but you can’t argue with 20+ unanswered shots
The apple doesn't fall far from tree .
Ruins the guy in under two minutes proceeds to wanna fight the whole crowd , how iv missed a benn in the ring 😂😂 well done brother amazing performance
too posses that kind of power on shots that are thrown that quick takes immense training. this guy has improved drastically and if he keeps training the way he is and not jumping into anything stupid this kid can go all the way!
Stopped a bit early for someone that experienced I think
Still a terrible boxer Connor Benn
Benn gave Vargas all of a minute to make an impression.. then made him eat 20 knuckle sandwiches in 20 seconds 😂
AJ, this is how you do. Finish Fury the same.
That's a bullshit stoppage, the ref should have given a standing 8 count but not waves it off, he was buckled but deffo knew where he was, Khan had him hurt multiple times like that in their fight.
Disgusting stoppage, sick of these ruining our sport. Great work Connor not your fault mate
Exiting to watch will put bums on seats
First round bloke would still be fresh should of give him bit longer if he goes down then give him the count and see what happens from there the bloke been in boxing for years he took worse than that before was stopped to early but not benns fault he done his job so well done to him.
I’ve not seen this benn much. Jesus Christ this mons a future champ
Extremely controlled aggression, eye opening display, real deal.
That was awesome man.
A KO isn't a KO now days how was that a KO?
Chip of the old block
these British referees must get good money under the table by Eddie 🐍hearn  what kinda bs stoppage was that the guy didn't even have weak legs
Apples don't fall far from the tree,like father like son, excellent performance
Calllllmmmm down... Vargas is a journeyman It was also your "british stoppage"
Damn!
Vargas should’ve taken a knee. What a performance from benn
Unbelievable that what speed...
don't get too carried away kids
Yeeeted lol
Well Done Conor...Onward and Upwards....You have the Mentality and skills to go a long long way ....
Wow he destroyed his opponent.
Connor Benn silenced a lot of critics tonight
Couldn’t believe how many of bens shots got Through and were accurate 👊🏽 but don’t stat biggin him up to soon😳
Now that’s exciting like father like son you’re the new inspiration for the next generation of kids 💪💪💪
Wtf i was expecting a KO that wasnt even a 1 punch KO! Ended in a TKO ya sky boxing idiots 😂
Seen Vargas get battered worse by Vergil Ortiz and the ref didn't jump in that quick. Typical british refs
Benn duppied that boi 💥💀😭😭
What Ubank Jr dreams about when he shadow boxing his pillows! 🤣
Wow   what an improvement  well  done  Conner   :-) ....  But  as we  all  know ,,  don't  get carried  away ,,  keep  both of your  feet  firmly  on the floor ,,  one  good  fight  doesn't  mean  nothing  ,,  look  through that ,,  and keep  focused .....  But    still  wow  well  done  Conner    :-)    :-)
Getting hate so watched it again.  Connor landed a really nice jab at 1:46 Possibly a good right at 1:48 - but that could have ben blocked as well. Very, very good jab at 1:49 Possibly one more shot landed. Why not call is 2?  So in total we have jab, a right straight, a fantastic jab, and then 1 or 2 more shot landed. And that's our fight. 4 or 5 clean shots landed.   Seriously? 5 shots landed at the absolute maximum? And most of you are ok with that? And you think the ref made a good decision? Because Connor landed 5 punches? OK then.  I said it before and i'll say it again. I wanted Connor to win. I thought he would win. But the ref made a terrible decision!
STOPPED WAY 2 EARLY
well done conor  look like a big hitter like your dad.....maybe even better
Bit early stoppage tbh
Someone tell Adam Saleh that's how you win a fight.
Wow. I thought he was a pretender. But he is a fantastic boxer. Very sharp. Onwards and upwards young Benn...🙏
New he would rip him a new one but wasn't expecting that 👏
I used to be a Khan fan early days, but benn would knock him out within 3 rounds. Benn needs to fight other top 10 ranked fighters , Garcia , Ortiz and fight for the title if good enough. 5 years is long enough.
One of the best finishes I've seen in a while. Clinical! 👊🏾
The power and speed of Ben jeeeezzzzz
Your doing very very well young man . But your dad already new that didn't he lol.  Chip of the old block !
class performance ruined by the cringe after the KO. Not a likeable guy
I love watching conor benn he is ruthless and is 100% going all the way ... well done 👏
Looking forward to watching this bout, I bet Samuel Vargas takes it on points.
Crawford time
Impressive
This kid will go the distance.  Look forward to following his whole career.
So far so good
Movements, leg work, solid jabs, firm ortho stance, this is a future champ imo
Hype job . Fs . Calls out Khan says a lot . Onion fs live in in his dads name and that’s not much . Steve Collins sorted that out 🇮🇪🇮🇪
It ended too soon! I want more! Who's with me?
Someones going home with a headache tonight and his name ain't Conor!!!!!
Great win!  Would love to see him vs. Kelly next.  Kelly slight favourite !?
Such improvements made compared to the jerky wild swinging brawler he was when he first started also the defensive footwork was on display, I say step him up no more measuring stick fighters he's peaked and ready bring em on!
Poor stoppage considering it's 1st round and he's still standing strong, Benn looked great and sharp but i feel Vargas is shot and was only there for the money tbh
I wanted Connor to win, but come on - why is no one else saying this was a soft stoppage.  Very poor decision from the ref to wave it off quickly. You've got to at least let the guy get dropped in the first round! I could understand if Connnor was beating him up for a few rounds and then this happened. But to stop the fight when he did? BS decision. This could hurt Connor because it will give him a false sense of security.    Very, very, very bad decision from the ref! At least let the guy get dropped in the first minute of the fight FFS! Look as Vargas when it was stopped - he knew where he was.  He knew what was happening.  Is this what boxing is now - you land 3/4 good shot and you win even though you don't drop the guy?  I'm glad Connor won. But i didn't want him to win like this.
Oh lawd.. poor stoppage.. one of the most inaccurate video titles you've posted this year  Damn shame
Power? How many landed punches yet Vargas still on feet 🙄 the younger man overwhelmed a spent force, let’s hear him call out a hungry young 🦁 but no he didn’t did he
No. Referee should count and wait  if he can't fully respond??
The fight could have went on at least till the end of the round but benn has improved when i thought he had already reached his peak, he has improved his confidence aswell,.
Benn is going all the way to the top if he continues like this! What an animal!
Been saying for a long time that Conor Benn is top notch stuff... even since his Peynaud days.. lets face it he was still very raw at that point 0 amateur fights so was bound to make mistakes. But hes shown since then why he is the second best welterweight in the UK next to Kell Brook. My only criticism is( since Benn had shown very spitefully he could hurt Vargas with a single shot ) the fight was stopped early.. its common place in a British ring for the ref to stop the fight at his or her discretion however its also customary to give a standing 8 count to a fighter kept up by the ropes which if you watch again he sagged against the ropes two shots before the ref waved it off. I only say this because i honestly feel like Benn is still learning and will have learned nothing from that fight... Vargas was not spent, make no mistake Benn would have stopped him!! But he should have been given a bit more time to ruthlessly finish him.
Vegas was washed up
Wow! Sharp, vicious and on point. Brilliant. Just like his dad. Deffo one to watch.
Connor was just warming up them shots were starting to look vicious
British boxing is where its at
He looked amazing well done
Stopped too early.
this was a early stoppage he should count him first and give him more time
Fast as hell and got bombs on he's hands
One of the best finishes I've seen in years.!
Thats strange... all the haters have gone very quiet
He done what Amur Khan couldn't do!
Looking like a chip off the old block.
I'm not convinced
Was it not stopped a lil early sure. They could of give it another 20seconds
Great stoppage for benn. Nice slick and fast hand speed and movement 🥊
Wheres all the haters now that was clean by Benn fair play to the ref he stopped it at the right time well done to Benn looking better and better every time you box
Even the angry victory celebration was just like his old man.
Poor stoppage, it was the first round ffs, give the fighter  a chance.
Ben .mint.
Connor Benn > Chris Eubank JR
This kids jabs look Leeethal
🐐🐐🐐
Exciting fighter
I believe in this dude... when everyone was hating him I stayed solid; more power king. Keep going forward 👑
You got to BRUK DEM UP 👊👊
Early stoppage he’s a decent fighter this isn’t a 4 rounder ffs
Does anyone have an accurate idea of how much vargas got paid for this fight?
Yes Conor Benn a boy turning into a man right there .....only way is up and cant wait to see him next time.
Amir Khan don't want that smoke.
Defend yourself or take a knee, he can't have any complaints about that stopage.
Khan's chin says " no thanks"
Try calling out hungry young  🦁
Benn is a class act beats a one fact
Crazy considering Vargas went 12 rounds with Amir Khan only 3 years ago
All the way to the bank
No way that should of been stopped
Stopped too soon.
Early stoppage.
Early
Very good referee .. good stoppage
This guy beats today’s Amir Khan
Vargas was still standing up, just stun shot.
Khan won't fight benn, he'd destroy him, he's looking the real deal and spiteful, ye spitefuls always good in a boxer, 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿😁🇬🇧
Beautiful shots
It wasn't a KO this was a TKO. Still very ferocious from Benn great speed and power
We all love a huge ko but it's nice to see a ref actually doing his job and protecting the fighter for once
Lol alright no need to shout at the spectators lol
Damn the accuracy, speed and power! Great display that will definitely worry other boxers. I can't see Khan taking this fight unless of course he is paid BIG money
Beast bro 💯👍
Conor is undoubtably up there with the best in the division 👊🏻 completely agree with his comments tonight - he needs to fight the best to know just how good he is 👏🏼👏🏼
👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
Not watched Benn for a while, he looks really sharp that was brutal
Let's play with 🇦🇱Florian Marku 🇦🇱👊👊
All I have to say is... WOW!! Benn is gonna be a real problem in te welterweight division.
Eddie has put conor in the rite fights . Not like brick top chucking his fighters in the deep end like he did with yarde , dubois and even gorman . Look at them now .
Whoop whoop .... get in .... fantastic stuff from Conor. Hats off .... I bet his Dad is still dancing hehehe
Conor just put the Benn name back on the map, expecting big things from him after this. And the way he lets off his shots is incredible!
conors speed was something else
BANDWAGON TIME
Hes gettin better n better!!! That was a good fighter he just diasected🥊💣💥
Benn has arrived! Its official 🔥🔥🔥
Would have liked it to go longer, just to put more skill under conor. Good stuff tho, hope conor goes far in the sport
Stopped a bit early.
Soon as he smells blood, exactly like his old man, just hope he can improve more and does let this go to his head, patience dude🤘🏻🤘🏻
Eat that son.
Beats pretty boy Kelly hands down
Such an improvement well done great victory
Don't rate Benn looking good for a money maker when he fights someone half decent.
Eubank Jr v Connor Benn, at catchweight
The quickest fight to be uploaded by sky sports
Got a good feeling about this kid
Stoppage was way too early. Vargas should have been allowed to continue.
Now that's a chip off the old block alright, Just like his Dad
Some of the fastest hands in the business 🥶
Click bait no ko just an early stoppage 👎🏻
Ok..line up Amir Khan..
That last uppercut was beautiful👌
a bit harsh to stop the fight in the first round when he hasnt even gone down
Well Done Conor. Will Macklin give you credit after saying Ortiz is the number one world prospect and you smashed Vargas quicker and with more class and power? No. Sky get rid of Macling and Smith for crying out loud. They are disrespectful to fighters every damn fight they cover. Get rid and make way for new decent commentators
Mesmerising hands from Connor Benn . I'd have like the referee not to have jumped in so quickly because I feel Benn would've KOd him.
I get why he is so angry, the amount of stick he gets, and with everyone callimg him out all the time, benn has improved so much and never fails to deliver, unlike soft boy kelly
I think conor should fight Vergil Ortiz Jr. Next
That was literally a vintage Benn performance!! 😂 Dad must sitting there thinking, "that's my boy" 😉   Really impressive and looks razor sharp. Definitely punching with bad intent...
Stopped well early
Sniper 🤯
Connor benn is a monster....the accuracy of those punches mixed with the speed and power gave a seasoned veteran little chance .....great performance 💪🏼👌🥊💥❤️
IDC this proved nothing, fight stopped too early.
hats orfe to Mr.Benn and hats orfe to the ref fer being switched on ....its nice to curl up and purr away fer a change
Premature to say the least   but very impressive by big bad benn  jnr
Good accurate shots
Big step up and smashed him. Loved watching his old man. Keep up the good work Conor, behind you 100% 👍
Conner there now next contender level khan 😶 or Ohara Davis 🤔
I'm not sold on him yet. He only beat Vargas who has been stopped multiple times before he's fought good opponents but never beat them.
this guys jus been knocked out in his very last fight and been knocked out by anyone decent his fought
You're owning this.... good luck to ya!
ref jumped in well to early there but conor benn improving hope he dont get an ego welterweight full of killers id like him to face a top 15 opponant next jessie vargas or a broner or lipanets
Bit of a wild puncher....there's sterner tests to come.....
Vargas had TWO wins in his LAST SIX fights and was coming in to this off the back of a KO also... Benn is developing well, but for ONCE can we not create an aura around a young fighter that is completely unjustified at this point. There is a VERY good chance Benn gets iced when he steps up against A CURRENT ACTIVE ELITE fighter.
You have to gave credit where credits due: that was something else! 00.00% of people saw that coming! 🥊💥🇬🇧
This fight proved f*** all .
The ref saved that guy.
Significantly improved. Stoppage was too early, yes not much coming back but also not many hitting Vargas clean and with the whole talk of Vargas being able to take a punch the referee should have let it go on a bit longer.  Next fight Amir Khan, Benn to start quick and pressure Khan with a KO win within 3 rounds
Has the power and picks his punches very well....very nice combinations and realising that Vargas would keep walking into that right hand all night
He's pushing all the buttons but let's give him a few more fights first.
OUTSTANDING
Explosive .. clinical ... focused ....
That was an impressive display, well done Conor, looking forward to big things ahead.
Daddy must be very proud.
Surprise no Vargas interviews!?  ....Bullshit stopage man. Vargas is known for his toughness, if the fight went 2nd half I'd predict vargas to win. I feel bad for vargas. Benn beats Amir Khan tho
Ref should I let you carry on a bit too soon
Savage
Fair play indeed and credit where it’s due. I was a Benn sceptic but that was  a very good performance. Well deserved win, it’s obvious he has been working very hard to prove his worth. Now looking like a top British fighter. Good on ya Connor
There goes the Khan fight after that
He does remind me of Khan. Very fast hands but questionable defence and chin (Peynaud fight)
Stopped too soon
His old man must be proud of him.
Chip off the old block
On that fantastic performance for khan's own health ,move on to bigger and better  things ,let khan n brook finish there careers together , awesome job Connor ,the world is yours to take 🥊🥊🇬🇧🥊🥊🇬🇧🇬🇧🥊🥊
I wanna see Conner Ben vs Errol Spence wanna see if Conor got what it takes to fight elite fighter of this division he looks quick and powerful but I wanna see him fight top rank fighters just to see what level he's on 💯💯💯💯
The fight shouldn't have stopped Vargas could have gone on. But well done to Connor proved me wrong.
Fair play indeed and credit where it’s due. I was a Benn sceptic but that was  a very good performance. Well deserved win, it’s obvious he has been working very hard to prove his worth. Now looking like a top British fighter. Good on ya Connor
Put Marku on and we we’ll see how fast benn is!
Rigged
love his spitefullness sure it was not his plan legend
Put him in and batter Eubank JR LOL
Tremendous performance by Benn, but ref let the fight go on for another 10 secs or so, stoppage was premature
If connor fights khan, khan will end up with his glass jaw smashed again
Superb performance.  Looking so good 👍
His hand speed wow.
Wow! That's all I can say to that, never expected anything like that amazing crisp quick jab, hard and accurate power punching.. if he can tighten up the defence and and work on movement he will develop into something really big. Totally gobsmacked cos I thought he was very limited when I first saw him a couple of years ago but this tonight has made me take serious notice👍🏽
Jesus Christ that was ferocious
Fair play to Connor Benn to fast from the start, my opinion the fight shouldn't of been stopped then.
Impressive.
Benn’s shorts look stupid, but the man can fight LOL
Hmmm  Tasty! 👌
He should fight Jake paul 🤣
Misleading title 🤔
Outstanding performance.
Have to admit, after criticising Ben’s lack of power, that’s given me food for thought.
Let's be serious. Benn is genuinely dangerous. Power like a mini Mike Tyson but hand speed like amir Khan. Style like Roy Jones JR. I would buy ppvs  for any Benn fight
I won't lie..I didn't see that coming. I thought it would be a tough fight. I even said as much in a previous comment yesterday.
Benn was exceptional but it was a very early stoppage.
Very nice fast hard combinations impressive
He’s fast , sharp & has a spiteful approach, I’m more than impressed
Wow . Well done Conor 👍
Benn's head is massive compared to his body
That jab has come on leaps and bounds, Vargas is no numpty, he was overwhelmed very quickly, Benn can fkin bang too
Lets see how he handles the next level
Fantastic! But I just wish the ref let it go a touch longer.
Loving all the fickle comments now backing Conor. If you believed in him before then good for you. It must be hard enough making it in the shadow of a great, let alone without all the doubters. I like many other thought this would be a test at least but while I was backing Conor for the win I stayed silent. Amazing performance. Well done Conor. Such clean sharp fast punches right on target. Who's next?
Bad stoppage
matchmaking will be hard, i dont think the top US / UK guys see him as big money PPV. He could end up having several fights against lesser known top 25 ranked boxers and one of them beat him and that will set him back. Eventually he will get his shot at a major belt and he will be too old in his late 20`s early 30`s
Disgusting sportsmanship.  Swearing after winning straight after
Deserves all the credit for blasting him away that early. But Warrington got given ever chance to continue against Lara and I think the stoppage was premature on this fight.. that being said I loved seeing be get the credit he deserves
Wow...
Bens dad was amazing
The progress Benn has made in his short career is phenomenal, a genuine standout in a division stacked with great young talent. May possibly be the biggest puncher among them all,even his hand speed seems to have come on a ton.
Holy cow
His father was class....Benn, Eubank era was superb for English boxing...  Terrible stoppage...what was the Ref thinking
Ben did well, ref was to quick to jump in! He was rocked but not gone he would of recovered if he let him take the 8 count, he recovered soon as the fight was stopped.
Unbelievable performance. Sharp shots   Question, could he keep that pace for 12 rounds? I’m eager to watch
The combo ať 1.44 to 1.46 👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿
I like humble Connor
Florian marku left uk
So Sharpe & fast with real power! Wow!
He’s a killer, simple
Love to see him knock Broner clean out
hes got speed with power and he’s handsome.  -  the whole package. good on him i like him
Stopped to early
Benn would destroy khan
Could have give him a round. Wasnt down was he. Wasnt out on his feet. Granted taking shots but you got to give fighter a second or so to take a shot and then adjust. Still think connor wins but vargas deserved a little longer to show a defence after a flury of scoring shots for me.
Hes improved a lot. He'd batter Khan
Benn is a problem. Benn V Virgil Ortiz.
Maybe it could of gone on for 10 Seconds longer but I don’t think so, benn was on point
Genuinely thought I was watching that last flurry in double speed
Absolute masterclass using the jab fainting with the jab and then throwing that overhand right beautiful boxing
This is clearly fixed
Well deserved 👊👊 some stamina out of Benn
Why did the ref stop the fight? Vargas was not done.   This is the issue with boxing, it should be allowed to continue until one guy is completely knocked out.
Good stoppage
Marku  Marku  Marku  Floriannnnn 🤜🤜✊✊✊
Avaneysan Vs Benn who would win?
I just wana know when Darren gee is fighting him
Brilliant Boxing  by Connor , don't ramp crush kill destroy  no messing about...nuff respect..
That’s the son of Nigel Benn right there. Brilliant performance.
Nigel was devastating and great to watch, junior is gonna give us another 10 years of class only better an thats something I thought I'd never say, if conner keeps busy and schools himself properly an not jumping into championship fights to early he can become a legend in this sport, and I hope he becomes a legend
Wow!! Conor Benn is unreal he's going strides
The power in those shots is going to take him a long way. His boxing is getting better and better too.
Definitely should not have been stopped
why do you encounter what you find on the way to accept with florian markun if you are a man what do you fight with the rest of the children  Florian marku champion
Kid has potential to be better than his old man, give him a serious fight and watch the kid shine💥
Good stop by the reff those punches looked solid
The quickest sky sports has ever uploaded a fight 👀🥊💥
Fast powerful and accurate
20 punches unanswered. Kids got skills
Wheres all the butthurt 'he never be like his dad's people at..?
Wow Conner Ben like his dad fast explosive and the skills he’s going all the way congratulations
Benn looks sensational here 🔥
Wow ben is super fast and destructive 😎😎👍👍
Class👌 bit undignified nonsense @the end
stopped too soon
Should not have been stopped??  wasn't even hurt??? I smell BS here big time!
He will smash khan and brook would like to see him with broner.
Beast Mode
Was a good stoppage tbh. but let’s keep it real he’s way past his best
Christ! He was throwing like Mike Tyson there. Same speed and brutality.
Chip off the old block, well done Conor, stepping out and making your own path. Looks like your in good hands there, very clinical. Always a fan of Nigel and I loved his comment “I was always about the tear up but he can box”
What was Connor mouthing at the end of the KO to the crowd?!
amir khan is washed up now he dont want no part of connor benn a young fighter coming into his prime.
GwaaaaaN Conor
😂 😂 Benn! I just knew this would be a walk in the park 😍 😍 👏🏿 👏🏿 👏🏿 this guy is special like his daddy
Ref stopped it way to early
A tad soft in my eyes, should be aloud the chance to recover and fight back so early in the fight.
Nice quick upload
Get in. Awesome job.
The ref stopped that too early...
Very fast and accurate impressive and hard puncher
I'm sure Conor's camp were hoping for a few more tough rounds under his belt from this fight.  He is running out of serious fighters to practice on now.  No way should he fight Khan. Khan should stay retired if he knows what's good for him as I think he would get destroyed by Conor.  Shawn Porter for me should be Conor's next fight. It doesn't even matter if he loses because the experience he would get from a fight with Porter will take him to the next level. Win or lose.
Beautiful crisp punches from Benn! Khan is a spent force Conor would eat him every day all day!
He’s making huge progress, be interesting to see what route they take him down. Bit irritating in his interview after though, ended up muting him. I get fighters have to play a certain character to sell the fight but jesus wept
Vargas is a gatekeeper to world level, and Benn just destroyed that gate.  The problem is going to be to find someone willing to fight him.  Khan will never step in the ring with Benn.  Looking down the rankings some names have been suggested 1. Broner - not happening, Broner is not world level any more and hasn't been since Maidana busted him up in 2013. 2. Kell Brook - depends if Brook has desire to get back in the ring.  IMO it is not a fight that will happen, Kell will want a couple of easier fights before retirement. 3. David Avanesyan: I like this fight but maybe not for another couple of fights, IMO it should be the final test before a world title fight.  I am going to suggest a couple of alternatives.  Next fight should be a fringe top 10 fighter.  My pick would be Jamal James who is a very good fighter but probably lacks the power to really trouble Benn.  Another option for much the same reason would be Ugas who is a really clever boxer
Love Benn. I’m honest I’ve followed his career since the beginning and after seeing him getting dropped early in his career against a journeyman I thought he would flop and wouldn’t go far. I thought this would be his hardest fight after seeing what Vergil Ortiz threw at Vargas. WOW!!! I am very pleasantly surprised and a couple more years should be world level. Highly shocked 🔥
Shite stoppage
That was crazy speed
Showing his dads ferocious nature there, interesting!
Wow. Punch perfect. Wish it went a little longer tbh but I’ve got to admit I’ve not been a fan of Benn but that performance was serious. He’s arrived . Can he do that against an awkward lefty from Portsmouth in Micheal Mckinson? That should be his next fight. Why fight Khan? He’s done, he’s better off fighting Brooke. So why not put 3 unbeaten British fringe world title contenders. Both have a big following so it’ll make money for both men and we want to see boxers taking chances not spoon fed washed up guys. Give me 2 young undefeated fighters sorting it out who the current best in the UK.
WOW, this guys for real, a chip of the old block, I am impressed.
Apparently conor benn wants to BEAT THE CHAMPION ASWELL AMIR KHAN 😂😂😂😂😂 another old finished washed up former name 😂😂
Put him in there with vergil i bet he smashes him
Amazing 😉 great performance!!!
Cringed at his behaviour out the ring not what you want to hear
Lovely uppercuts he didn’t see at all
Boom.
Fantastic stoppage that, so accurate and picked his punches wisely.
🔥💥🥊
Conor Benn is a beast !
Got some talent I'll give him that. Still need to see if he can step up though against the elites.
Benn tattooed him
One word... Wow 🥊🥊
Well done Benn 🥊 check my reaction vid if you have time guys
I haven’t seen hand speed and power like that since Jason Genova was hitting mits in the old worlds gym back in 2012
Wow quality
He’ll deffo knock out amir and brook by the looks of it. Well done young champ Ben!!!! 😎
Go fight the gladiator Florian Marku 💪🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱,....enough fighting bums
That was brutel he got sick of all the hate he will slap Khan that hard he would give him a new haircut! Shluld of let him let off a few more shots he was close to dropping!
Too early stoppage
Good performance from Benn and wish him all the best, however the welterweight division is stacked with great boxers and it will be difficult for him to win a title any time soon.
Eddie possibly trying manoeuvre him in a position to be air to AJs thrown as thier PPV attraction for the UK for matchroom and sky  Going in the right direction and got to potential to be a crossover star For fuk sakes he even speaks Spanish in a stare downs 😂
Big improvement NGL. Didn't think he had this in him
Kinda looked like he was gonna throw some more there 😅😬
Early stoppage
Destroyer 😎
This Been Time,amazing attitude and confidence cant wait see more. Well Done.
Conor the real deal benn 👊
20 quod that charlatan charges the British public for these cards stacked with 1/10 fans
Nice 👌🔥
Not bad against a never was.Lets see him step up to a world champion
If the ref hadn't of jumped in that geezer would of been knocked into the future. Very good from Benn.
Next world champ
Ref jumped in a tad early for my liking, at least let a man touch the canvas b4 jumping all over him, good performance by Connor Ben tho
Damn, he looked every bit as vicious as his Dad there. That was some seriously sharp speed, accuracy, power and aggression. I'm excited to see more.
Can anyone say they were watching him 3 years ago and knew he was going to improve like this? Absolutely crazy! Fair play Conor Benn, paving your own path
Funny how there is not many comments for Conor. Come on lads this is better than his Pops. Give him appraisal . Nice one Conor I knew you would f... him up quick.
Good lord what a performance. The hand speed and sharpness of those shots were vicious and incredible. Scary thing is he will only get better.
Didn't even get a chance to skin up, almost disappointed 😅👊
Great power and great speed
Absolutely rapid hand speed!
Feck me, he hits hard!
Savage
I'm impressed massive improvement
That was punch perfect. Felt the referee could've given Vargas another five to ten seconds, but he looked out of there and threw nothing back to be fair.
Lol
Has the ref never heard of a standing 8 count?
No he could have carried on..
Put him up there ffs top contender dat
Who didn't see this coming, not talking about the result. People once hating now jumping on the Benn bandwagon. Job done, keep on improving Connor.
In my opinion, i thought the ref was right to stop it when he did. Vargas was hit with some hard shots and was in trouble. Safety first. 👌
People keep writing benn off and he keeps proving them wrong.
Early stoppage, let the man go down at least
Now go and look at all the comments the duck suckers on here made when he fought Luke Kelleher
Benn is a beast!
Wow he’s going places , shame can’t say same about Hatton
Devastating from the Essex boy!  👍🏻
Vargas thought Benn was an entitled joke, easy pickings and an easy defeat. How wrong he was....
Khan has had second thoughts after watching that.  Maybe he actually will fight Brook now after all lol
Adam's commentary 🔥 like always
massive improvement from benn well done
Ref stopped too early
That vargas went 12 round with Khan, Khan isnt even a boxer he's window cleaner, Benn looks the real deal
What a bullshit stoppage
Great performance
People will still doubt him and he still has alot of unanswered questions but you can't deny the power he's exciting to watch and will cause a  problem for all the fighters in the division
The sharp uppercut he caught him with near the end.. the speed and accuracy at the final combination. This guy is definitely exciting to watch, and will be great to see him fight Khan .
Vargas was already swelling under the eyes from the jabs before the flurry. No way the fight should of carried on, Ref gave Vargas plenty of time to get him self out of trouble but kept taking heavy shots.
utter crap. split them up. welcome to back hander ref. stop the fight. . poor ref had his orders ,before the fight started.
went 12 rounds with KHAN and got hit in the face a 1000 times. I wonder what was gonna happen when he met someone with some power. derrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! Ben did all he needed to do. Hit him flush a few times. Its not rocket science.
First round. Hands still up. Still moving. That’s a tough stoppage.  I mean, don’t get me wrong, he took a good few clean shots, and it was probably about to end so I’m definitely not saying it was a terrible stoppage, but with his pedigree, experience and it being so early you’d forgive Vargas for expecting a little bit longer.  Flip side of course is that 1 more shot can always be that one too many.   Pretty brutal and impressive from Benn.
He is a dangerous man him. He bangs Khan out
I would have let it got 5 maybe 10 seconds longer personally
🔥🔥🔥🔥
No head movement they shouldn't have let that dude in the ring.
Vastly improving with every fight, becoming my favourite fighter(bar josh Taylor 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿💙) what a performance tonight 👊🏻
No too early that
Ref stopping the fight early in the first round. Thats some baby ting
Benn is different gravy like his old man...Superstar in the making
Give Conor about 2 more fights with top 10 ranked WW's and IMHO........he'd be ready for Avenesayan.
If ref hadn’t have stopped it, Vargas would have been knocked out cold or worse. Benn did everything right and his punches are hard and fast!  He just needs tougher fights before stepping up to title fights
Im not really a big fan of conor benn but that was insane. Fairplay to the lad.
The accuracy on those punches is impressive
That's woke them all up.
My fav fighter of all time ever Nigel Benn fecking soooo brilliant ...wow I'm loving Conor Benn...👍👍👍👌
He was so fast, I had to put it in slow motion. I suggest you do the same from 1:40 onwards, just totally devastating punches, and a really fantastic win, stopped at the perfect time by the ref.
Benns reputation went up in my books strong hands look forward to his next knock
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻❤️🇬🇧
Stopped abit early
Ref should not have stopped that..what a farce
Albanian King Marku said : Benn can beat only weak boxers
The fight is up already lmfao yes sky!!
Ref just saved that lad’s life.
Reminiscent of Prince Naseem (in snippets) with those quick combos, they looked venomous
In the Greatest respect to his old man Conner has proven he’s his own man and deserves everything that is coming his way 👏👏👏👏👏
Those were some were impressive shots & too many unanswered.
Early stoppage ffs
Awesome well done Connor 👊🏼
Very impressive but it was definitely a little too early, he was getting nailed with big shots but who is to say he was not just a bit shocked and may have recovered, maybe he would have taken a knee if it went a little longer.
Well done ref
Hes good but stopped too early
Benn would absolutely batter  Kelly and that Albanian geeza
Cracking performance 🙌🏻
Connor Benn fucked him up
At least 10 viscous ‘neck jarring’ punches landed without a single response from Vargas.
Amazing, and this the guy that went 12 rounds with Amir khan
Amir Khan v Conor Benn???
Come on Benn. Why don’t you fight Mark?
His attitude after the fight was appalling! Realistic who has he fought?! Nobodies!! He thinks he’s Mike Tyson. Bloody bum, calling out Amir Khan! Hate him or love him Amir has done brilliant on the boxing sport, cracked America and won world titles! I pray this bum gets knocked out! There was need for him to act like ten men calling out these pro’s who have won it all. Loser
Lets see what they say now? Lol 😂
Best KO I seen in awhile 💪
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think he should have had an 8 count. Conor did what he had to do but tbh even Vargas wasn't really even moving his head so kinda easy target tbh
Gew on my son!!!
Kahn and Brook are both finished. Benn far too young and hungry, he would tear through both of them on this form. Put him in with the guy that beat Kelly. That would be a better fight.
Great to see another Benn serving up the action. His father is my personal greatest ever fighter. Great things beckon...
Stopped too quickly
This kid going places
82 seconds? Early night for everyone then...
Stopped way to early. Not Benn's fault but ref way too keen. Benn looks Good . Very quick.
Early stoppage tbf if that was the other way around benn would have been given the benefit of the doubt for sure
Wow brilliant finish... Well done conor
Seed of a ¢[][]||\| did well
Nice one..
Explosive 👊💥👊💥💪
Sharp and strong punches
Put him up there!
Impressive stuff.
First time watching Benn, thats huge potential, what a boxer!
Where the standing 8 count ffs
Lovely work from Benn  , wish ref let it go on a little longer so he could show off more
Hungry
This is the best I have ever seen him, speed is power, and I think because his speed has improved, its made his punches more powerful also,hes fine tuned now...people saying the stoppage was early,the ref saved Vargas from possible injury who nows, those punches were accurate and coming in quick with pure venom...a second or two of that and he wud have been on the canvas no doubt
Absolute savage 🤯🔥
Wow
Let’s get me to 1000 subscribers quicker than this fight. 😂😂🔥
Buried him. 👏👏
No way on earth will Khan or Brook take the benn fight after that performance and he hasent even peaked yet!!!
Could be Britain's next big time fighter
Change the playback speed to 0.5x, then you’ll understand why it was a good stoppage.
OMG, Conor Benn has improved so much, without a doubt he has the power the skills and the hunger of a true champion. Well done Conor. Got you marked down as a future world title holder.
At first I thought the ref should’ve given Vargas a standing 8 count! Then I read that the WBA doesn’t allow standing 8 counts so congrats Conor
Great work from Benn, reminded me of watching his Dad when he lets the hands go good clean accurate power and speed from Benn and only 24, he's only getting better and very dedicated he building up to be a top contender.
Conor was brutal here. Measured clinical punching. Stoppage was a bit early but at the end of the day if you're not protecting yourself the ref is entitled to wave it off.
If that'd gone on any longer Vargas would have met Jesus tonight.
Conor Benn discovered steroids
That finish was insane
Yes Shame  he's comment about kids with club feet a few years ago. But that got swept under the rug
I cant wait for the "Amir Khan Dance" when Benn catches him lol
Conor has lightning hands👊
Benn would have definitely won but that stoppage was poor
Looking at all the comments here about Khan is hilarious..so he got Vargas in one round, big deal.. Khan got LoGreco in one round too something Spence and Porter couldn't do either, Khans fought a fight with  a bigger puncher than Connor , did everyone forget about Marcos Maidana with over a 90%Knockout ratio 29wins 27 ko's? Khan knocked him down in the first round, Khans not an easy fight by no means i think people are massively overlooking what hes achieved and who he's fought.
Dad must be proud... well done Young Connor Ben...Nigel was a terrifying fighter ,legend...
Impressive
Like father like son 👊🏻
early stoppage man ffs
F'me Connor i didnt even finish my brew 🤣
Hes gonna be a huge star
For how long will they be setting up these fake matches?
Florian Marku the Albanian 🇦🇱 King will destroy Conor Ben. Marku keep calling him but Conor to scared to face Marku
" CLINICAL "
Devistating blows ...
Wow knock him flying , I knew he would not make the count
Me whee!!
Fair play
Well done young man!
Stopped too early total bs
Early stoppage
I thought the stoppage was early so I watched it again and counted the hard punches landed from benn from 1:30 it's like 25+ .. Vargas 0 and taking heavy clean punches over and and over again not even throwing back ... On second thoughts maybe not so early Vargas should've took a knee those shots were nasty to take .. can't take those clean and not throw back especially when it gets to 30 40 punches. The more I watch the more I think yeah fair enough I can see why he stopped it his legs even buckle several times
Omg😱😱😱 the ref saved Vargas life
"F all you lot!" 🤣😂 Yes, Conor!
Another early stoppage on a matchroom card. Why can't they give the man a standing 8 count? Some good clean shots but Vargas didn't go down, he was overwhelmed by the fast start but could of recovered with a 8 count. He's fought elite level fighters, it's not like he's a plumber from Doncaster.
Bruck him up
benn is vicious, unbelievable improvement, hes going all the way
Standing 8 count?
He's stepped right up power speed the lot fuk a duck
He's massively improved. Hope we get him and Avenasyan
Ref stepped in too quick
I was just getting comfortable when he absolutely wiped the floor with him🤣 last week Khan was calling for Benn, tomorrow hel be calling for Brook🤣🤣 Well done Benn👏🏼🥊 Go for the belts 🏆
Sky KNOCKOUT  TRUTH - technical knockout stopped on his feet never went down once
Khan don't want none of that.
Everybody laughed at me when I said he is better than Kelly  They are not laughing now
This kid is the real deal for sure, so many had there doubts about him in this fight, 82 seconds... I’ll just leave that there🙂
WTF!
"virgil ortiz is probably THE best prospect in world boxing, if not THE best prospect."  -matthew macklin 2021
You can see he is developing into something pretty special. Sharper, cleaner and an exciting fighter. Way too fresh for Amir.
By "knockout" you mean the softest tko I've seen since calzaghe vs manfredo.
Mustard
Ref was right to step in and stop it,Vargas had no chance, Benn was to fast and accurate with his punches 🥊🥊🥊
Fast, hurtful shots. 👊🏻👌🏼
Vargas can't complain when he threw nothing in return whilst receiving so many flush shots. Mental speed & accuracy from Benn. Improved massively.
Does anyone honestly believe that if the roles were reversed the ref would stopped Benn that quickly?
Stoppage slightly early but Benn did what he had to. Looked very sharp. Tremendous speed. Reminded me of Sugar Ray Leonard in that regard.
Get the fight everyone wants Eddie!!  Conor Benn vs Tyson Fury!!  🥊🥊🥊
Lights were about to switched off........ early but good stoppage
Hand speed 🚀
Ref stopped it too early , he had his guard up still taking the punches after a few hit him before farce corrupt ref must of been payed off
Khan would pan him
Eubank vs benn
Vargas should have been given an extra few seconds.
The ref jumped in a bit to soon he should have at least gave vargas a few more seconds
Think ref was a bit keen for a fighter of Vargas Pedigree. Think Vargas would of gone down took a count & carried on. Even for Benn would of been better to either force him to take a count or Clean him out
Calling Vergil ortez a prospect but he’s a world champion? 💯💯🤣👀
Whatever you think that was 99% accuracy.
Watching the fight live I thought the ref stopped it too soon, on watching the replay he was spot on. Benn is the most improved fighter in this country, very Sharpe jab and hand speed.
No messing about I grew up watching nigel benn and all the other greats he is a better version of his dad
Good stoppage from the ref, Vargas taking too many clean shots and looked too dazed and sluggish while protesting.   Benn has killer instincts.
stopped at perfect time by ref, no need to cause permenant damage to  anybody in this great sport. all the lunatics saying it was early need to lace some gloves and step in the ring before talking crazy
He's going all the way to the top
Vargas took some there!  Hats off to him, he would have been seriously hurt if the ref didn't stop that!  Way Benn was going at that you would think he had been doing this for years and was a defending champ! That was an amazing statement there.  Well done Connor  Nigel would have some competition there. He can certainly box and punches like his Dad
Stopped waaay to early was really getting into the action as well.
Vargas could've been killed there. Ref stopped exactly at right time.  Benn looked sensational
The uppercut 🔥🔥
WOW!!!!!   Connor what a fantastic display of speed and accuracy, well done 🥊🥊
Monster
What a performance...20 heavy punches landed in the last 15 seconds...the poor guy had no chance against that speed
Referee should’ve at least let him hit the canvas!! Bit of an early stop for me, Great boxer though, dad is a legend he used to be on normal telly on a Friday night as a kid brilliant
well i feel bad who's buy to watch this box.....
He'll kill khan.😲
Marku will destroy this glass chin benn
Wow!!!
What an emphatic performance, don’t wanna hear nobody talking about acid tests again
Top work
How is that a knockout?!
Improved massively, Benn has become a real problem
Savage ✊🏾🥊
Just finished watching the UFC Here to see Conor smoke this dude Let's go!
Absolutely clinical they were mean shots had to be stopped
nice looking fast,THANKS FOR SHARING SKY SPORTS
Wow, that's extreme power and speed pleased to see it stopped great referring.
Now What... ?? Critics.. NOW What??? One of the fastest learning boxers out here  Well done Conar
Bad stoppage that.
✊🏾
Amazed how sharp and powerful he looked. Great future
Haha, it's like they stuck an 80s fighter in the ring with today's jab, jab, jab, straight, jab Zzzz fighter, chap got eaten up alive 👌🏻😂🍺
That was a LOT of CLEAN punches going in there. Ref was a tad sharpish.  But I think it was how MANY flush shots were landing.  Well done Young Benn. Dangerous indeed...
Fast powerful punches. I thought Vargas should have taken a knee but he was just steam rollered
Easy work.... impressive!
Great performance but lets relax with the Errol Spence, Crawford, Porter talk. He's no where near that level. Vergil Ortiz would even beat him easily
🤔 Where is the count Ref???
Ref stopped that way too early
His interview after the fight was hilarious lol. Sounds and acts so much like his Dad 🤣
massively improved speed, intensity and focus, Think Vargas underestimated Benn
Wow the speed tho🤩 you love to see it 🤩🤩
Stopped a little early but what accuracy and hand speed
Punch perfect fight
Great insight and fight prediction from Macklin.
So surly the ref gives Vargas a standing count no?
Khan hit him with twice as much shots in one flurry in their fight, but yet this is a stoppage. I do like Benn but this stoppage was horrendous!
Absolutely brilliant👏
Wow
Vargas would of fell out the ring if it wasnt stopped
Ref called it off wayyyyyy to early maan smh bloody hell 🤦🏿‍♂️ but Benn looked sharp and dangerous in what he did I like him I'm a fan and would like to see him smash through Amir Khan also lol 🙌🏿🤠
Devastating. He has the fighting instinct on how to finish! Scary! Measured! 💪👊💥👏👏👏
Hand speed + power = dangerous
Payday
Benn va eubank in the future ...my moneys on benn
How much did Benn get paid for this victory do you guys reckon? Serious question
what a statement aye an angry man going on about critisism that doesnt happen just get on with the job and stop crying i say if you want to be a true champion of boxing
Very very impressed. I am a fan now!
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 class!
That's what happens when you don't throw punches
Porter beats him. Why is Broner being mentioned? Khan won't want that fight.
Queen Khan wont take that fight. No reward for getting an absolute pasting.
Hes his daddy's boy for sure
Decent but that was so early at least let him go down and get a count wtf laughable
He's changing into a different animal
That was an excellent performance, he's come on leaps and bounds. Wow 👍🏾
That was lovely 😮
How can anyone dislike him, definitely ppv worthy now !
There's no way khan is taking this fight...
Lol I said it on live chat so meny dickheads said he couldn't stop vargas
what an absolute joke of a stoppage , vargas has been in world title fights and that ref should not be aloud to ref a fight ever agaion ,disgusting,shouts rematch
Unreal boxer connor benn
It’s just a shame we all wanted to see Eubank Jr vs Benn Jr 😔
Steamrolled
What a statement from Benn!!
Good stoppage
Wow what a good short fight
early stoppage tbh
