This dude is hilarious.  Love his attitude!
"Everything works" and pointing down there 😂 Lewis is adorable 😂
I love that guy! Hilarious!
Tourette isn't,t a disability it is a superpower
Lewis is an amazing awesome man. I love his music.
fake
Much respect!!!! ❣
Lewy just gotta be such a likable lad.
My son has tourette's so it's nice to have a face in media to relate to for him!  It doesn't hurt at all that Lewis is amazingly talented ... funny as all get out... annnnd the charm just ooozes from him!  He just seems so very down to earth.. and easy to be around.  I also love how unfiltered Lewis is!!  It's refreshing and it's highly entertaining. I think it will show others with the syndrome.. that you can achieve your dreams and what a role model they have in Lewis!!  Not that he signed up for that.. or owes anyone anything.  I just think it's wonderful that he is owning it and just being himself!
everything works
0:13 I lose it every time. It's just the way he explains the reason. 😂😂
We love you lewis  no matter your syndrome! You are one awsome  feller!
He's definitely high
My son has tourettes and I am so grateful for this video.  Thank you so much.
Wow Romesh lost a lot of weight.
These are the kind of people to make famous..
damn ive never seen him in an interview before this after listening to his music for some time now and i love him even more!
damn ive never seen him in an interview before this after listening to his music for some time now and i love him even more!
Disabled people make a lot of disabled humor😅
I have Tourette Syndrome, I would like to be like him...
Unfortunately once again the audience is laughing at the moments where he is being serious about his diagnosis. Tourette's is not funny, people. People with Tourette's can be funny because they tend to have a great sense of humor. But when they talk about their diagnosis, DO NOT LAUGH.
Mindfulness meditation... Water or swimming pool relaxing are both  good therapy... And you can comeback... Just stay away from stressors, energy drink, coka cola, coffee and tea...
😂  0:26
Love this guy so much. ❤
Everything work epic
I never realized, but he's a funny guy. Very charming. ❤
that dude is so funny
Eu uma brasileira que ama esse cara ,suas músicas são maravilhosas ele é tudo de bom, não me canso de ouvi las ❤
Ok Lewis has controlled Tourette's... saying the right swear words at the right time gee what a trouper , watch Lena Zavaroni singing Going Nowhere and tell us that she was not being destroyed by her management team and her family, see Lewis this was a child that was told she was fat when she was nine years old, that is a horror story, listen to her version of going nowhere and that Lewis is a child screaming for help
Dude is relieved he wont die because degenerative disease and audience is laughing xd
Just luv Louis, great singer, and he makes me laugh. ❤
I wonder if his use of social media played a role in diagnosis. There has been an increase of tourette's associated with tick tock and other short video platforms. I know it is more prevalent in girls and young women, but curious....
He is hilarious! ❤
Anybody else get it later in life ? I got it at age 50  - its gotten worse in last couple years
I love this man ❤
He’s adorable ! And so authentic 😊❤
Tourettes is "funny" until you get exhausyed.  Deppending what kind you have.
Everything works! 😂😂😂
I love Lewis so much! He's a riot. ❤
Was watching a video of him performing Someone You Loved in 2019 and he didn't have a single tic. Did it just hit him out of no where at age 26?
Eric Cartman?
Seeing the video of his concert in Glastonbury made me accept the fact that I have tourettes.
this guy is solid gold
65, born with tourettes syndrome,  I love how he totally owns it!
This guys fukn hilarious!
What a treasure he is! 🥰🤣👍🏼
Now, THAT is bravery.
This guy gives my brain a boner, it's so appealing listening to the way he talks and so funny!
The world n “f-bombs” is out of control, otherwise I love this guy
My son has Tourette’s.  His mothers maiden name is Giles a direct descendent to Giles de Tourretts
I dont understand. He went through his entire life growing up without getting diagnosed? Thats insane. Poor guy.
The look on the sht Indian comedian’s face is just gold 😂
This guy has a gift.
Black dude did not know how the act the whole interview…brother wanted out
Capaldi is a treasure. Embrace the gift he shares with us.
Why is this a 'modern' disease it did NOT exist in the 70s whem I was an adult..same as lactose INT and fking nut allergy...weaklings
I bet he be funny to smoke dub with
Lewis is the funniest, down-to-earth guy i’ve ever seen😂 i wish more ppl were like him, spreading joy to other ppl with his genuinely beautiful music and heart of gold ❤
I’ve worked with a couple of folks with pretty profound Tourette’s. They may have motor tics, but you will never ever know how awesome they are at trying to repress unwanted muscle activity. Yes. They do fail at times, but their ability to control tics when they need to accomplish fine motor skills is simply amazing, I guess because they have to practice it all the time just make it through a day. My favorite doc of all time was an ENT specialist whose main practice was implanting cochlear implants and doing any surgery involving the 8th cranial nerve. This man had serious tics.  New patients would kind of freak out when meeting him to discuss implant surgery or maybe acoustic neuroma removal and the like. If they were getting visibly uncomfortable with his tics he would open his desk drawer and ask that they hand him one of the surgical tools me kept there for just this purpose. The moment the tool touched his hand every tic ceased.  Fortunately for me, he did surgery at an old style teaching hospital.  That meant the surgery was essentially a small theater like room with an open ceiling and balconies surrounding it.  I used to go watch work with a zoom lens on a camera. His hands were simply amazing.  I say this as someone with 20 plus years of experience doing microscopic  inner ear surgeries and dissections on a variety of small mammals. Anyway, I wonder if suppressing unwanted tics played any role in this man’s ability to play music.
The end!!!!!
"Everything works" oh ladies~
He's like mj fix
lewis is pure gold
He needs to stop cussing- he looks like a cool guy but I wish he would not cuss.
the boy language of the woman next to him FFS
Absolute legend, amazing voice too 👍🏻
Wait y'all I have it two bc I twitch a lot to I ain't lying
His music, not so much fan of, to slow pazed, but his personalty, damn. Golden soul
The fucking master
Lewis could do standup comedy 🎭
This is the second clip I've watched of him on a talk show and he is just so funny and charismatic...seems like the rare celebrity that you could actually be friends with.  I will now proceed to search out more of his appearances and interviews...
He's hilarious. Need more of this guy.
Just love him 💙
Lewis is a fucking legend !
It’s not funny what they think when you have Tourette’s in Belmont New Hampshire. Police and fire first responders tried to take my life because I have  Tourette’s and I asked for help to get to the hospital with heart trouble! Stay out of Belmont New Hampshire. They’ll take your life if you present with Tourette’s and then lie about their actions, Governor will do nothing to protect you if you have Tourette syndrome from police violence.
that black dude is just ughh.. why so fucking serious
Just another toiletmouth
I just love Lewis and his music and all that makes him the wonderful man he is.
Cocaine is not that good anymore 😅😅
He is hilarious in every interview. Omg. He had me laughing in tears when he was on Graham Norton😂
This guy is gold both in voice and heart 💛
This guy is one of the funniest comedia- wait what? He's not a comedian? He does what? He's a singer?! Hmmm he's probably not great but I'll check him out...  *two minutes later*  WHAT THE ACTUAL FU...
Everything works 👇👇 😅
What a legend!
The good thing is you can do cocain from now.
It's amazing how this guy can go from writing and singing beautiful song to being a jolly old fuck who never ceases to make everybody laugh..i love how he doesn't care, a truly funny fellow
In name of all of us with motor disorders: We gladly accept Lewis Capaldi as our poster boy. <3
Who is here after watching the crowd help him finish his song when he had a Tourette’s attack? I have mental health issues, and I am so glad the stigma is lifting
Silly goose
Get well my favorite singer pls
_"Everything works"_ I know exactly what he meant and I love that he said it and thinks like that!
My brother has Tourette’s syndrome and suffered for years misdiagnosed and wrongly medicated. ❤😢
Id sure hate to be a person paid to be a comedian sat next to this guy lol, imagine the feeling of imposter syndrome
He could be singing about a trash can and I would cry and he could be talking about a trash can and I would laugh my ass off
Him being so transparent is a relief in a world full of celebrities being fake, fake laughing, fake smiling and shit..
this was awesome! he's funny! all jokes aside, he's an inspiration to those who have it!
you have to love him
What a guy!!!😂
My fave ♥️♥️♥️
It’s cocaine infused Tourette’s no point feeling sorry he did it to himself
Lewis: I thought i had a degenerative disease  Audience: 😂😂😂
I have suffered this.. I know how this feels. This man is a big positive soul ❤
Fake.
Everything works ↘↙
I thought i had a degenerative disease. Crowd laugh.
Stay out of Belmont, New Hampshire, Louis, the police force will take your life when they think it’s drugs, and then lie about their actions. Belmont, New Hampshire is extremely unsafe for people with Tourette syndrome, the police chief and the governor Chris Sununu of the state will do nothing to protect you from violent police action. Absolutely nothing.
They added some ill timed laugh tracks during this lol
2 mins of a good laugh is worth it, dude is an amazing guy as a person and a talented artist.
He's not had the easiest journey but that's not stopped him 1 bit. His music his voice his character is just bliss such a lovely talented guy with the world at the palm of his hand. I wish nothing but good for him and I hope he smashes the world. From mine to yours Lewis don't change for  anything you got alot of fans and we're all here with you
I mean why are people acting like this is a new condition? I’ve known of it all my life just never met anyone with it
It seems like tourettes is a British thing giving brits twitches because of sh*t cocaine, cause ive never met or seen anyone with tourettes besides British youtubers and celebrities.
You are beautiful singer beautiful writer and you just keep doing what you're doing you expressing your love So the world to see the beautiful person I love all your songs❤❤❤😃
he has the best sad voice
God bless him.
La persona nunca es la que es
... at least not right now... :D I almost died. :D
Everything works is the best joke ever! Love him!
Oh my god, he is adorable! How is someone so mega-talented also so charming and funny?
How long has he actually had it before diagnosis
Very funny lad. Refreshing and honest❤
Lewis is real, humble and extremely talented.  Love you.
I love non American broadcasts, less filtered languages.
Everything works 😂
LOVE his music and sorry to hear about it
Bro this bloke could quit singing tomorrow and start stand up comedy 😂
Jazzy is going on a walk right now and I don’t want him going out there to go out and play with her and not get her to do that so she can go out with me cand and then I
That's the best cover up I've seen. Amazing.
I just love how he doesn’t care about anything and just does what he wants 😂😂❤️he speaks and acts freely anywhere he is, like it’s his home.
I had Tourette’s as a kid and I outgrew 95% from puberty but I still have that 5%, and I remember what 100% feels like, I’m sorry Lewis Capaldi, the same thing that gives your brain Tourette’s is also the thing that makes him a musical genius. Mozart also had Tourette’s. I’m not musically gifted whatsoever but I am gifted in logic (math, game theory, and geometry make sense to me like a language I had always known
The guy could literally become a stand up comedian if he gets bored of music and singing. Amazing wit and humor!
"everything works." as he's pointing down under. :)
❤ sending hugs and his so open and funny sharing about it.
tics go away. i had one before. the thing is. if you think about it and aware. you keep doing it.
Wtf where we talking about 😂😂😂😂
When he said everything works I DIEDDDD
Stop sw3aring
So simple and genuine. Most humane singer. Even rude sometimes. 😁
Why is he famous????
I'm sorry but I've seen someone with tourettes and to me Lewis Capaldi is just another foul mouthed celebrity using tourettes to enhance his career. That said I do like his music.
Lolol he must have got the jab
Capaldi is such a vibe
God I love him
💙🎵🎶🎵
Everything's work👏😂❤️
Most replayed note never fails.
I hate Tourette's!
These clips are fun, but it's actually bringing back a months long blinking tic I'd finally just gotten rid of 😅 I don't even have tourettes? Ughhh
And Elon has Ashbergers....open, honest = good
Everything is works.
I love him
I used to employ a guy with torrent , exact humor as this guy
So funny and honest and a breath of fresh air. No fakeness just him being him 😇
I have Tourette’s and a grandson with ts.  I love you 🌺🌼🌸
His music isn’t to my taste, but he is an absolute laugh a minute!
Man I'm going through some hard times in my life lately & recently stumbled upon Lewis's music & his documentary. He's definitely A bright light & made me laugh a lot. Nothing but happiness, health & success to him. But yeah its A hard thing he's going through but through mine he cheers me up, I'm grateful I stumbled across him. Going to look more into his music as well
Disgusting mouth on him
he / you are a blessing dude. Take some time, get some you time to heal inside and we will be ready for what ever you do next.
Wow Tourette’s, mental health issues and dis-Ma-Lexia I wonder what the next trendy thing to have will be for all our great celebs? Excusing Dame Judy hope it’s somat awfull debilitating and Fatal!
Lo adoro. Il modo in cui ne parla ❤ I adore him. The way he talks about it
love him!
The fun fat guy
❤
THe vax crosses the blood barrier. Did he take the jab? I suspect yes.......
Lad is hilarious!
This didn't happen until after 2021.  COVID Vax gotem.
Why he actually so funny
Hang in there Lewis.
Who else watch the video repeatedly without get tired of the fun 😂😂😂😂. More likes up here😊
Para mí es hermoso ❤️
get well soon
What if tourettes is his cover for being on cocaine? Conspiracy theory!!!
Safe and effective. Vaccines did the same thing to me as a child and I’ll never let them live it down
"What do we want?"  "A cure for touretts!!"  "When do we want it!?"    "C*nt!!"
they are laughing at him, not with him. he's just a lardy boy with Tourette's.
I was smiling watching, Lewis is really funny guy. I like him and his songs.  Hope toretts will go away from him.  Wish you the best Lewis🍀
Fuckin legend!
God bless him
Lewis Capaldi looks like he's been eating too many of his Frozen Pizzas 😳
Hea genuinely so funny
...OK, I do almost that exact same thing with my head/shoulder A LOT. Maybe I should see someone about getting a diagnosis.
Romesh looking like a miserable tosser because the musician is funnier than him
I also have heavy tourettes, I do use Cannabis and almost never get them, glad to live in a country were it's legal
I wonder if he'd benefit from Deep Brain Stimulation.
He is so authentic
He's a naturally, genuine, funny guy is Lewis, fair deuce to ya
That's a HUGEEEE problem for me. People also think i am on cocaine but i am the only one sober in the room.
I’m fine everything works 😂
He is the most hilarious of all people i ve ever seen. He is so "giving" with everything and I hope people treats him well and takes him seriously because I can imagine he have a deeper side to. But he is just a joy 🙏🥰
Humour really is an aphrodisiac
Hy Lewis.  Huge fan. Beatles then you. Hey, I knew you had Tourette's before you did. Could you help me? All will be private Lewis.
This mf is the king ahahah
He could really retire from music and be a comedian
Lewis is FUCKING GOLD
Yeah it sucks man. I know exactly how you feel. I'm just thankful every day that it's not vocal and I only have twitches too.
I like this guy
'people think that i'm on cocaine a lot' HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH HONESTLY THATS WHAT I WAS THINKING THIS FULL TIME
Love how funny and genuine he is.
Hats off to Lewis... he's done well for himself. Nice to know some record companies are going for pure talent rather than looks.
Lmfao — he’s 100 % okay with this diagnosis as long as his 🍆 works
my son is a 'tourette-guy', too.  from his first symptomps 'til the reliable diagnosis it took us 8 years.   i suspected it, but had no proof.   when the doctor told me '...and we came to the conclusion that your son indeed has tourette', i bursted into tears.   she said "no, don't cry".   she comforted me, said that of course it's a severe diagnose but it's treatable.  my response "i'm not crying because of the diagnose.   i'm happy that his odyssee from doctor to doctor, from hospital to hospital, from medical examination to medical examination has finally come to an end.  now we know what we're dealing with"  he always was so afraid of needles...when they needed to examine his blood to look out for any other diagnose and he cried every single time because of it...when you're not able to help your kid...it breaks your heart as a mum.   and my heart broke so many times...  i love him so, so much. he's my hero.   a hero with a great, supporting sister.  ❤
What was so great was in one of his concerts with a lot of fans, his tourettes kicked in and his fans sang the rest of his song.   It was a wonderful sight.  His fans know he has tourettes and they love him and helped him out by singing the rest of the song.  Lewis is also good friends with Nial Horan and Ed Sheeran.
Did he tic before or when he was a child? There's been so many neurological issues with the covid vaccine, makes ya wonder if its that.
´Everything works´! 😀
The daily new paper dont look so bad himself, so funny when white bread have badmind, It it cocola track  sport meeting, asked? 😮😮😢😢😢😢😂😂😂😂❤😊🎉
This guy has gotta be one of the most humble, genuine, honest and funny musicians to ever exist, I can see why everyone loves him so much
man singer songwriters form the uk never stop being strange af
everything works... fucking gem
He's fucking hilarious!
Give him his own show already ****
Omfg, Lewis is seriously hilarious 😅
He's Scottish he's definitely on coke 😂
Tourette's or not, he is a disgusting, vulgar child.
I still feel like he's doing an elaborate prank on us, but I'm just happy there's someone like me in show business now. (No, I don't have Tourette's I'm just on cocaine at the moment).
he‘s a blessing.
That's what the vaxx does to you
He should concentrate on losing weight & eating healthy foods.   Possibly lacks omega fats & eats too much palm oil
Jokes apart and he sounds like the mate anyone wants to have a drink with .musicaly he sounds like a hummm to the soul .quiet impressive .fa
I love him.
I’ve always been scared of Tourette’s but he makes it seem like it’s nothing major  Biggest fear would be to get a episode in the bedroom
music so sad, guy so funny
Ele é muito maneirinho.
Who is that Indian guy sitting next to Madonna
. When asked what did u think it was... I would bet my life he was gonna say ... All the fuccing cocaine... 😂
The slight laughter at “degenerative disease” is hilarious in and of itself like are degenerative diseases funny now? 😅
I love Lewis, he’s so real
What a fucking legend, the optimism, the funny vibe, the spirit, a true spirit u can hear from his music too. What a guy. This video just makes my day honestly❤
I can totally understand because I was born with TS also.
Why did the crowd laugh when he said thought it was a vegetative disease? I’m guessing they didn’t connect the dots in real time as the what he was saying.
Is Lewis Capaldi able to do an interview without cracking a joke through every 2 minutes. Gets a little old and boring
Love him he's hilarious
My ex had this and my family always refers to him as the retarded one. That still makes me sad 15+ years later. He did the same thing and would rub his face on his shoulder and his skin was raw from doing it. He hated the meds and didn’t like how it made him feel. 6’3 man all tatted up, tough as nails and it was kind of nail biting to hear anyone try to point it out. Any disability and the stigma takes away from the struggle those going through it face. My husband thought Tourette’s was just phonetics and I had to explain that it’s physical too, some actually injure themselves badly and it’s awful. Just knowing someone with it changed my whole view.
❤️❤️
My son was also diagnosed and has the same tics. I showed him this today, and it made him happy to see someone like you also has it. He has yet to meet anyone with tics and I feel it makes him think he is the only one and some kind of weirdo. He knows he's not alone.
I have Tourette’s syndrome and it’s super awkward. Sometimes if my tics are out of control, I have to do like a public disclaimer wherever I am so they don’t think I’m on drugs.  Tourette’s syndrome is like being on drugs without the high so essentially, it sucks😂
He looks like Paul McCartney’s son
I have tourretts and it's cool seeing someone successful with this
Watching this vid made me tic and laugh so much🤣.
The black guy didn’t care for Lewis’ presence and taking over the convo lol
Lewis literally making fun of his diagnosis 😢 he’s such a positive person and so brave to Announce his diagnosis
HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE HIM???? 🤣
Lewis is so funny, love him
Love this guy❤ his an amazing artist and an amazing person!! Double win win 🏆
When he says fu... awesome he means it cause he is fu.... awesome
I adore him, he's genuinely funny and I'm glad he's relieved about his diagnosis but I can't imagine him being the 'poster boy' for it when there's so many other ppl who have it 10x worse.
If his music career ever fails him, he can go into stand up comedy 😂
Guy is geared up and blames it on Tourette’s 😂😂
https://youtu.be/5IccfT70OT8
❤
lmfao he is absolutely hilarious.
lol, he is funny lol
That must be fucking fucking awful.
Bro, I’m so sad that he’s looking like this 🤦🏿‍♂️ I don’t even know his music I just know him by name, so sad
It's one of those put me on the spot and the more comes out though. Let me be myself and I'll be right there one with ya.
It's not tourettes buddy. We all know what drugs can do to our body's. Lol🤣🤣🤣 nice cover up tho cuss from what I've seen in all your other live performances you never use to twitch and now all of a sudden you have tourettes
Prior to uncle buck
😂
Someone you loved is one of my go to karaoke songs...
There is an unannounced competition in Scotland to be a funny bastard. Everyone knows about it and there is huge competition and everyone has to lift their game.
As someone with Tourette’s it’s soo nice to see someone speaking out about th… FUCK
He obviously also has ADHD. Which often is accompanied with tics.
I am in love with this young man.
god I love Lewis. he's just so normal and open and just real. and funny as hell! could merry him like 100%
He's so funny!!!!!!!!!!!!
IF HE'S DONE MAKING HIT SONGS, HE CAN VERY WELL BE A STAND UP COMEDIAN !! 😃
As someone growing up with ADHD, Tourette’s and OCD it’s not easy. You feel like you have to prove yourself, at least that’s what I felt. Life wasn’t complete. Whether it was playing Junior A hockey in Canada, or becoming a certified Millwright. Nothing filled the void I had. Until I gave my life and my trust to the Most High God and his son. Yeshua Hamashiac Jesus Christ is the way, the truth and the life. I hope whoever reads this that our Heavenly Father blesses you, guides you and protects you from the evils of this world. In Jesus Mighty name and precious blood
So long as everything works brother 😂😅🎉🎉😢😊❤
Common Lewis W
I’m just confused why his parents never took him in to get checked out?
Heard about his condition on IG so i came on here to look him up. I had no idea who he was. This is the very first time i watch anything from him and i liked him instantly. He is sooo funny😂😂
He is so nice!!! ❤
The comedian at the other end of the couch is raging after being upstaged by a singer who is fucking hilarious, the two women are laughing away but the supposed comedian on the end looks like he'd rather eat his own cock than laugh at Lewis.
He's so normal 😂. Love this man
Lewis is just downright hilarious and damn can he sing. What a guy!!
*Lewis Capaldi swears* whole room goes into stitches 🥲🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣why is it so funneeeeeh
I love this guy so so much, fuck
his not the poster boy for tourettes but if anyone can remember the guy from big brother Pete and he won it, he made everyone aware of the disorder and understand
He's real world funny. Like that friend you have that tells the best stores and make you laugh all the time. like someone you want to hang out with.
Tourettes my f@@@@ ars##$%@
Why do people like him? Can’t stand the guy honestly haha.
THAT GUY IS FUNNY
The poster boy for charisma
lewis capaldi is fucking hysterical 😂
He s horrible
Imagine him on Taskmaster.
I had a buddy in the Navy who's right shoulder would jerk up like that and his head would turn to meet it and it would almost look like he was trying to bite his shoulder. It was starting to happen more and more frequently (our stress was steadily increasing ) and one day he did it and it clicked for me. I asked if he'd ever been evaluated for Touretts, to which he said no. He'd never heard of it. Which was not all that surprising at the time. I only knew of it because, ironically,  my brothers best Navy buddy also had it and he'd educated me some. Less than a year later, once we were state side, he had his diagnosis.  Awareness is everything. Thank you so much for sharing your diagnosis Mr Capaldi.
He is quickly becoming my number 1 on the fantasy dinner party list. Talented musically, funny and seems a genuinely brilliant guy. Love him
Capaldi is one of the few artists who's music you can despise but you just like the bloke so much.
Well it pays to advertise lmao
If Lewis wasn't a singer he would have a great career in stand up comedy 😂
You wonder why you never see Lewis do day time interviews 😂
It always makes me laugh how we're allowed to hear the swear words on the audio, but they're censored on the subtitles. Are deaf people not allowed to swear??
as someone with tourette’s, it’s really nice to see more people being open about having the condition because it spreads so much more awareness for our condition.
I have no interest in his type of music but what a fucking legend this guy is. An awesome human being.
Stop stinging about your ex bird you weapon
ugh I feel so bad.
The more you get to know this guy the more you love him
I have tourettes and I love this lol
He needs rest, he is famous enough, that stardome does not look good on him... so talanted
Wait, is that Ramesh at the end of the couch?
We need to protect this man at all costs
well done you,
I was misdiagnosed for 10 plus yrs all my other docs said it was "JUST ANXIETY" when NOOOOO!!!! it's continued on and on until MY BRAIN DOCTOR diagnosed to me with a complicated complex severe case of tourette syndrome and I also have tics from another debilitating condition. I have called FND. It's not common for people to have Tourettes and ticks from a separate condition, but.... I AIN'T THAT COMMON I'M A VERY SEVERE COMPLICATED COMPLEX CASE!!!! My brain doctor told me on the third person he is ever seen with a severe case of Tourettes and when he saw me he pointed out. Yeah this isn't anxiety. This is straight up tourettes and he also told me he sees and so does my new neurologist that I do have tics from FND as well. I hate that I wasn't diagnosed a lot sooner. I'm 36 now. It's really debilitating going for years without knowing what's going on. I knew what tic disorders were but I had no idea what tourette syndrome was until a friend of mine showed me one of Evie Meg and that Tourettes lesbians videos showing that they had signs of Tourettes and my friends told me to go see a brain doctor or go to neurology AND I DID took a very very long time but I'm happy. Unfortunate now. I have an answer but still very sad. It wasn't diagnosed when I was younger. It's really debilitating in someone. No doctors will listen to you. Any new find that right doctor that listens to you and I'm very happy. Unfortunate that my brain doctor and my new neurologist listen to me and always ask how I'm doing
There is no Tourette's. Demons are clever in this world
As someone with adhd, i get similar comments sometimes xD going out at like events or something is a total dopamin boost due ti novelty, so people think i am drunk sometimes even though i haven't had a drop
Must have got no attention as a child. Poor thing.
As I am not a watcher of British television, I have no idea who that lady is that is laughing at everything. But I agree with her.
Not only an amazingly beautiful voice but he is also an amusingly awesome, & funny, guy. 💕
Love him !
Capaldi is the most genuine and fun person out there ever... So glad he is still himself after all the success...
I love him so much. What a complete modern day icon
Absolutely funny
Funniest guy in the room
I was diagnosed at the age of 6, being labeled at that age has its toll, the meds that make you gain so much weight, and zero support from Drs or so calles professionals in neurology, to call your self a poster boy for tourettes is a ducking joke!
Maybe the most likable person lol
This guy is hilarious🤣😍 never seen a interview with him. Kind of surprised.
that’s some stress
My favorite thing about watching Lewis on chat shows is witnessing the dawning realization on the faces of the other guests of how actually funny and charming Lewis is.
To see a human being, being a human being without the worry what other human beings think is an inspiration... Fking jealous, get in there Lewis👍

Lewis and daisy were the highlight of that show
Lewis ffs
I feel he gets special treatment from others.  Look at the way the women on the panel reacted to his attempts at jokes.  He was not that funny but they overreacted.  Are they feeling sorry because he has tourettes?  I hope not as that is usually not what people with conditions like that want.

I could listen to him talk about everything and nothing, he’s so effortlessly hilarious.
Is Capaldi "all there"?
This fucking guy 🤣🤣
Genuine star.. so much z list bullshit around 'stars' these days esp on the net!
He’s Scottish and dosnt need subtitles 😂
Don’t make me laugh, right nob
Everything works 👉 👈 hahaha
Love this kid. He always makes me smile.
I got epilepsy at 23 and the way he ticks. Is what happens to me before I black out into a seizure. Brain disabilities aren’t fun and because I don’t physically look sick. Some people look at me funny because I have  a disabled bus pass and I get other privileges for being disabled . People look and think I’m pretending. I would give everything to have good health again. I’m sure he’s putting on a brave face.

The geezer wearing the glasses looks well pleased that Lewis is funny,  maybe he's not liking a singer is getting more laughs. TBF the JR show should just have booked Lewis capaldi. the women football player was boring AF and the glasses wearing geezer was boring
What a guy! 😂😂
Surely he means diabetes
CAPALDI STONED UP 💪
He's a singer? I thought he was a comedian...
Easy to get a career like his when he has his family connections. His first big hit was stolen from a youtuber. His latest billboards for his tour showed him lounging naked , not a pretty sight.
Nah he’s so naturally funny 😂
He should do stand up comedy as well,  he's so bloody funny 😁
Eric Cartman Lied about having Tourette’s too.
I don't like his singing, but I love his sense of humour. He should take that up instead, he was hilarious!
Stewart Lee has let himself go.
did he cut his hair??
Probably me, but never heard of him!
Lewis  capaldi  is so funny  i was crying  with laughter    and he is so talented  a great singer
Congress tart
I just love Lewis!!!
Is there any way I can watch his full interview online? Btw thanks for putting in subtitles. As non native english speaker i can finally understand scottish haha.
Who is this women say next to him 😠 Needs stick taken out her arse. Screwed up face looking and judging. Just over a 2 min clip but she infuriated me.
He doesn't have tourettes....Nice little thing to play on though
Fuck sake man...i think i might have Tourette's....Bastard.
Everytime I see an interview with Lewis Capaldi I'm like "That's hi- really he wrote all those songs?"
If the singing ever dries up (which it won't), dude should totally do comedy. What a legend.
He is just your boy next door cracking you up and making you laugh.  He’s crazy funny this guy...... crazy funny I love him
Is this a new series
never seen an interview with him before, he's fun XD
When he added 'fucking' to a sentence that he didn't even know where was going I lost it
not a huge fan of his music but he seems like a really cool guy
Would actually love if Peter Kay tours again or does another tv show for Lewis to feature in it somehow, either as a support act or a character in it idk, he’s just so naturally funny and honest and I love that.
He's so talented, he's funny, he's humble and he's Scottish... winnnnnnn! :)
Funny guy!
Why oh why didn't this guy try stand up makes me pee myself every interview. Scots are funny buggers.
That was best when he appeared on. TV show and said to Lorraine - I'll give you seven inches.
Loving DMC wetting herself laughing the whole way through…LEGEND ❤
Absolute legend 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 need Lewis a kev.I.n bridges together now that would be funny
WhT an incredible talent
White people have all the excuses tourets ptsd the flu bo just high cocaine insane missed the plane forgot what it was just the list goes on forever oh aye & I'm.just a fat prick
Always a joy to see Lewis Capaldi!
I thought he was a great Dr Who.
Romesh are you upset than Lewis is thousand times funnier than you ? Annoying pos
He is amazing i love him. If the singing ever dries up he can easily do stand up comedy😂
Cheer up Romesh ffs
jonathan loves romesh a lot i see
Total legend. I was in stitches watching his interview last night. Funniest guy ever. Great talent.
It really must have been a great relief when he heard it wasn't something life threating. He's got a great spirit so I'm sure having Tourette's wont get him down.
People think I’m on cocaine, but I’m not  “At least not right now” 😂😂😂
I look forward to the rest of that interview. He's an amazing guy.
You commenter are harsh
He’s always the funniest guy in the room, even when there’s an actual comedian present.
He is hilarious
"everything work" 🤣🤣
We need to protect this man at all costs. He’s just so wholesome and cute! 😭♥️♥️
Are the audience actually listening to what he’s saying?  “I thought I had a degenerative disease” doesn’t sound like a punchline to me.
I think Scotland has the highest rate of misdiagnosed Tourette’s suffers in the world (per capita)
