I know Randle had an injury but that effort and defense was disgusting to watch from him. Don't play him. Glad he got traded. Effort and no brains lost us this game from Randle. Randle lost us this game
this was really one of the best games for Brunson in his first playoff games as a Knick, i wish Randle didn't lay an egg in this series my god
7:18 here should’ve been a travel on Jalen Brunson 😢
2:41 should have been really a double dribble on Kyle Lowry, but no call…😭
This is why Obi was mad. Played the man 6 minutes and he didn't play the second half. Could've easily went differently with a better coach
1.5M 1mo 20.6M subs
Go Miami
Put some respect on the #MiamiHeat 🔥🔥🔥
Loool
(watching New York Knicks)
…
knicks in 7
Thibs dropped the ball. Playing an injured player too many minutes knowing OBI can give you what you need. Quick didnt even play this game. Yea thibs got to keep using the formula he was during season dont switch up now you not prepared for it.
I like the Heat chances in the East!
Kevin love baseball pass is 🐐🔥
Randle and Barrett suck dills all day long. Get rid of them like yesterday!
I think there's another bubble rematch that happened in 2020. And also, I'm excited to see the battle of Kevin Love and Lebron James in Finals😅
The Knicks have been exposed big time in this series.  They took full advantage of a young Cavs team with a below average HC.  Don't have those same advantages in this series.  Would have very likely been a sweep if Butler played in Game 2.
NBA FOR YOUTUBE NEEDS MORE BASKETS MADE CLOSE UPS
bring the ring to Miami Heat 2023!!!!!!!!
man its so hard to see DROSE in the bench and just clapping :(
We need to Love GOD MORE ❤️ Second to our fellow brothers  NOT hate ,quarrel🙏🤝
Himmy butler
It should be Jimmy Jordan Hahaha
The Heat are playing Great Basketball but it's not over let's get 1 in the Garden and make it interesting especially because Stephen A Smith is OFF the Bandwagon #LGK
Brunson a whole bucket but his defense and ball hogging skills has cost the knicks.  Just imagine if he get his big men involved( they are more bouncy- for defense and rebounds. I mean they are called CENTERS for a reason.  If you get Randle and Barrett involved those young scorers can facilitate enough points to contend against a veteran HEAT team. Lol  Then 4th quarter drop 26 points on the point guard who been chasing you around all game.  Again you a bucket but you don’t play no defense. If I’m sitting on the toilet and can see it then you know good and well the mavs seen it and the knicks see it.
I dont like the knicks but the fouls were crazy
i can't see tyler hero in miami heat..
Both these teams have zero chance against 76ers.
Huge crowd
Put D Rose In
Hope the Heat win it all....guts!
Just observing
Why the refs letting knicks be chippy after every play ... call it right  gab,  kevin, adebayo  all gettin hit. Watch the film #espn #nba #TNT #nbarefs
#23 should've been fouled out
forced in my home to eat drink and be with ppl i do not wanna be with if i end up with anything of urs or u steel from me imcalling fbi.
i love to see that Love has a lot of playing time. Kudos to Spo
Go mia 😊😊😊
1:28 Kevin love passing underrated 🤣
Himmy Butler🪣🪣
Jimmy Buckets is lethal. I don’t think anyone left is going to have the stamina to stop him.
3:09 two ridiculous shot clock ending three pointers in a row is crazy🤯
wow
Spo is a tactician....man DEFINITELY plays chess when he coaches...this is a tough deficit for us but we HAVE to play smarter....and with urgency ..let's go knicks
Nba is rigged and everyone is just dumb driven cattle watching the bs unfold
Man, where is ZaZa Pachulia when you need him?
#LetsGoHeat
Himmy buckets mod3
The Knicks are doomed.  Can't rebound the basketball when it mattered most.  I love this underdogs Heat team.  They will grind out games defensively to get a win.  Wow such resolve.  #HeatCulture #HeatIn5
It’s jalen B and the loser show get rid of everyone but him and ya big man lol randle and dude who name I forgot. Oh Barrett I don’t feel like deleting what I typed that’s just how it feels watching Barrett and randle chaos no period. Exactly!
is that some kind of basketball clown doing the in-stadium announcing?
o my fucking god on that martin slam
It's going to be a rematch between the Los Angeles Lakers in the Miami Heat playoffs 0:09 ❤❤❤❤
Knicks just don't want it as badly.
Arrasando como talia. 😄😄 la maquina heat.
Yeah Knicks need a center badly
It is possible that we could see a 7 and 8 seed in the Finals.
Wow,  we may witness an 8th seed go to the finals.  Ironically the knicks are the only other team to ever do it
As a Cavs fan, the Heat are doing to the Knicks what the Knicks did to the Cavs
🏀🔥
bwahaha* .icks
Arrow Crusher
Arrow Crusher
As a Heat fan, I'm glad we got K-Love. He has been a big addition to our rotation.
MY NAME IS EVAN AND I HATE BASKETBALL
The Knicks didn’t beat the Cavs because they played well, it’s because the Cavs played like trash, Heat in 5!
Jimmy THE DAWG Butler!!!
It’s so weird when your actually a fan of a team and go to a comment section that was a bunch of Warrior loving, Bucs are gonna win everything, Jimmy Butler isn’t enough, Miami needs a superstar, type people. Now it’s all love? 🤣🤢
Jimmy butler balling with a mess up ankle crazy
Im concerned that Butler is going to burn out again when he gets to the finals, or maybe even conference finals
How Bout them GOONS FROM SOUTH BEACH 🔥🔥💯
By the day, that Hawks win in Miami in the 7-8 game of the Play-In Tournament is looking bigger and bigger by the day.
The number 7 seed Los Angeles Lakers and the number 8 seed Miami Heat is proving to all the doubters that doubt them of being an actual threat for making it to the 2020 finals just because it was  a "bubble" playoffs/finals shockingly they two best teams playing in the playoffs today and of course it may not be the same exact players that play on each team respectfully but both teams still have a couple of key players that played in that 2020 final series.. but this playoffs is far from over both teams got to win five more games to make it to the finals
Randle sucks i wouldnt built a team around him. Knicks need to trade his sorry azz. 😂😂😂
Sweet victory payback 4 them pestie knicks beating my cavs... 🤦🤷 MIAMI.. style baybay....
Wheres the "knicks in 5" members at??
Knicks need to think about trading Julius. He is a good player but i feel like they could get a person that fits them better than julius
i must admit ithought the heat were too old to get to the eastern conference finals, they are spreading the workload around perfectly, they feel no pressure.
Jimmy buckets is just dangerous⚠️
Bro somebody get this man Jalen Brunson some help man
When Barret set that sneaky ass screen on Gabe, and Brunson hit the three. You could see Gabe talking shit.." oh that's how we playing" lol then I knew Miami was bout to cut ass
Miami is a good example of what good coaches can do to a team.
These Knicks are collectively missing the New York hustle. They play like they are sleep walking through Central Park with no sense of urgency or even the sliightest bit of appreciation for being one of eight teams left in the NBA postseason.
Randle is too lazy for defense
Siri, play Jimmy Cooks
The Miami Heat employ five undrafted players in their 10-man rotation: Haywood Highsmith, Duncan Robinson, Caleb Martin. They also have two undrafted players in their starting lineup: Max Strus and Gabe Vincent.   In a league featuring 450 of the greatest basketball players in the world, it’s easy to misidentify those undrafted ones as mere bums. Haywood and Robinson have been non-factors in this series. But Strus, Martin, and Vincent have been certified Knicks killers. The trio is deeply in-tune with Spoelstra’s game plan and seems to relish the expanded role with Tyler Herro, Victor Oladipo, and at times, Butler out with injuries.
Again, Kevin Love with single digit points. WTF? Come on, man. You can do better than 8 points.
NYC & GSW find themselves in a hole.  Who amongst them will stay alive and force game 7?
Crazy i never see as many empty seats in a playoff game as miami
I think it's a bubble rematch LA vs MIA
Jimmy is retiring for the heat .
Philly or Boston are going to have their hands full with Miami. Their playing with a lot of confidence.
Outmatched
👏👏👏
1:03 miami player playing football, no dribbling needed
Nba it
Jimmy Bucket!! Man if you watch him closely he has got to be the SMARTEST player in the NBA and another point, why has Spo not won coach of the year EVER ??????
Pack your bags😂
Knicks showed heart but they gotta play a smarter. Fighting own teammates for rebounds. Not being aware of out of bounds. Trying to dunk instead of giving it up for an easy lay. The effort is there but just got to think a little ffs. If you guys didn't know Jimmy Butler is going to pump fake everything close to the paint, I don't know what to tell you. You guys made the same these silly mistakes early in the season, how have you guys not cleaned these things come playoff time.
Let’s Go Heat!!!
Laki na nag ulo mo butler👇👇
Laki na nag ulo mo butler👇👇
Benedict Riley! Why did u diss us like that?
Miami..hulog din kayo SA east..promise👍👍👍
Barrett has to improve around the rim. He's below average at finishing drives to the basket
If the Knicks Put Fournier back in the lineup in New York they might have a chance Lowery is a big plus & Kevin Love has the Downcourt lob off Randles lazy Hustle. If they lose its the coaches fault for not using players off the bench. Even Derrick Rose  someone to slow the momentum of Miami
I live in Miami and obviously a Heat fan… However, I like me a good basketball game… This feels sad, Brunson seems to be doing his very best to carry the team while Randale is just giving up half the time. Brunson got my respect for ages, doing it all on a bad ankle.
1:02 that was Randle's fault and didn't even bother to trail Vincent.
Outcoached!
Call it a hot take but Miami in 7. Knicks win 3 in a row
Good game from the heat and erik my cavs shoulda did the knickerbockers the same way but they gone b on the couch just like my cavs😂
As a die-hard Knicks fan I hate to say this... but Jimmy Butler OWNS the Knicks
Can’t believe knicks beat the cavs so easy they look like a completely different team against the heat the cavs and knicks are not ready yet
They wont listen this is what happened. D rose will be a good assets on this game
8:12 this foul is another level. If the defender had is hands up it wouldn't be a charging foul but just cause he puts his hands on his dick its a charge.? Even tho the defender makes contact first because his arms are down in his front and not straight up. wtf does putting his hands on his own dick and falling himself causes a foul its so trash.?
Miami heat vs. Lakers FINALS! 🏆
Butler and the Heat at their finest!
I got the Heat going all the way.
The Knicks should fire Thibs.
Now brunson sees what it feels like to be the one carrying a team while everyone else does nothing like luka did, haha should have stayed in Dallas
Has anyone noticed how the referees and even the announcers are favoring a certain team? Maybe I haven’t played long enough especially at the cage or a Rucker park to see that somethings on.
Knicks have a squad full of first round picks that don't want it as bad Miami's group of undrafted players
Lakers Heat rematch in the finals.
Such a fun game to watch
Holy, the Nicks deserved to lose this. They looked like they couldn’t give a shit.
Can someone put d rose in the game already
Lowry 😢 😭 "U the Best" dj Khalid voice. Anybody seen the movie Hook? I'm having a moment. It's the scene we're the Lost Boys suddely changed faced and ideas about Peter Pan. Lowry, I Believe
The refs were awful
New york needs to rebuild. Those bum looking stars not giving this team a championship
Noticed that heat arena isn’t always full and crowd isn’t that noisy and load unlike homecourt of lakers and warriors.
Butlers presence alone is as valuable as anyone in the NBA.
Heat play dirty AF. Its ight though, Knicks werent ready at first. Game 4 they raised their physicality to match the Heat they just couldnt grab a rebound and when they did they got called for a foul 😂  Next game I expect them to DOG THE F out of the heat. Gabe Vincent is going to be targeted for Hard Screens just like they did in this game, next game they should do it to Caleb Martin, Duncan Robinson, Max Strouse, and put them Screens on Jimmy Butler all game, On Ball Off Ball, just put the pressure on him. Make him Guard JuJu in the post and dont go for a fade, just back him down play after play till he gets tired or taken out.
Tomorrow is gonna be the toughest game to win for the Heat but I have full confidence in them to either win it tomorrow or back at home on Friday
I'm a Celtics fan but I can't help falling for Miami.
The heat's offensive production is predicate on the refs NOT calling any moving screens.  The only reason they get open is because Bam, Zeller and Love consistently move the screens and stick their hips and legs out.  So instead of giving the Knicks a chance to go around and not switch, the ILLEGAL SCREEN forces the switch and the defense to help, thus leaving shooters open.   I swear, down 3-1, I would bet every dollar I have.  If the refs start calling the heat out on all those ILLEGAL screens, the Knicks will blow them out of the freaking water.   Jimmy Butler is a bucket, the rest of their offense is sub par.
The Knicks doing their best Cavs impression.
caleb martin is so inspirational,his giving his all,i'll give him a big credit,pls give him a duncan robinson salary..
Watching this game and that 1 commentator sounded like a knicks fan 😂
The heat went from 0 2 hero real quick
Randall seemed out of sync
But How the Fuck did they Call thwt An offensive fould on Julius randle thst was the worst No call in the playoffs
I Tip hat off to the entire team this Game though Not just Jimmy Butler the bench even contributed They know there way better As A team.
C'mon My guys u gotta Win Game 5 u gotta!I know use can.
Lakers vs heat rematch ???? 👀👀👀
Fire Thibs!!! His adjustments last night: Start Grimes and have Hart come off the bench. That's it! You have to be kidding me!
Snake Loster (Scott Foster) shouldn't be allowed to be the ref of any Nba game. Especially game 5 of the Heat vs New Yerk. Which is the next game. It is that Knix knat homer nba commissioner Adam Silver that order his refs to do these one sided injust rigs. They all got to go. The league needs impartial honest people. Not these cheating riggsters due to popular ratings of cheating teams like the Heat in favor of the more popular teams. The Heat would of gone 4-0. If it wasn't for what they did.
revenge for my cavs is sweet thanks miami
This is why Jimmy was smiling and waving at Knicks fans in GM2, cause he know he would see them again up 3-1
is it REMATCH FOR FINALS 2020 LAKERS VS HEAT 🔥
The East Playoffs are nothing like the West. You can definitely tell whoever wins the West has already won the Finals.
🔥🔥🔥🔥⚡️⚡️⚡️👑👑👑❤️🌎🏀 💫💫💫👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think heat can succeed to the chip  if they can defeat the winner in celtics 76ers battle, if not denver is the opponent from the west
This team is the wrong product, look at the staring liner of the bench, and look at the heat, every player is super starts, and NYC is overdue!
Heat fan here since 2011
thibs and his lover randle cant wait to start their summer vacay early together!
Amazing play when Love torpedoes the ball down to the other end of the court.  It's called sharing the Love!
The Heat have the right pieces. Strong bench with Hero and Olidipo ready by the finals.
New Yorkers should migrate more to sunny Florida!
This the 8 seed? 😳
The lack of playoff experience showed in this game for the Knicks
The heat is onnnnn😊😊😊
Just imagine what embiid and jimmy could have done to this league.
Give spo credit unbelievable he is truly little pat Riley 🔥
Butler vs Lebron is what I'm hoping to see in the finals. Both are a beast when they are on playoffs mode
MIAMI HEAT ARE CHEATERS...HECK They are playing a matchup zone every time down the floor... 5 guys standing in/near the lane...Knicks coach seems incompetent... ref's are blind Put a taller guy on Jimmy Butler & keep them off the offensive boards..Julius Randle is Trash Derrick Rose should be getting some minutes....💯✔️
miami vs lakers looks interesting
Knicks are going to get gentleman's swept by a bunch of YMCA players, mailmen and grocery store workers (led by Jimmy Buckets of course).
As a raps fan I’m rooting for the heat to come out the east, klow deserves another ring
What happened to when Randle dunked on zeller
To be honest jimmy basically walked through this series he not even doing anything crazy like he did against the buck's miami is just a much better team
Miami the dragon slayer..
Miami heat since birth 🔥🫰🏿
Look guys I'm a Knicks fan.. but I gotta say Jimmy and the whole heat team played really good basketball. The Knicks played horrible defense. And thibbs just wasn't involved enough
Miami goin up pretty swift
The Heat are a great  team trying to figure out why are the Refs helping them so a lot of no calls
Miami heat is incredible unselfish plays good coaching staff they rely on each other they play as a team 🔥
No need to watch the rest of this series
Let’s go Heat love see all the steals great defense !
SEND THESE CLOWNS HOME ASAP!! THEY ARE NOT ON OUR LEVEL
Congratulations Miami 🎉
I feel bad for Randle. 😢 As Lakers fan and he was a part of Lakers way back then. Hope soon he get a chip soon❤
But but the refs ,but the bubble, but nothing! Miami#1
Go Heats Go
Heats Is On Their Way To The Next Round
7:57 CMB Caleb Martin Ballin
Sana pumasok sa Final ang Heat
This is the shit bowl here. Neither team deserve to be here
all the games are good this year bless em
I can’t believe what I’m seeing from Miami with my own eyes. This is insane.
GOOD 🎮  GAMES. ROCKY ROSE GOLD..
BINg BONG f*ck ya life heat in 5!
This game…The Knicks had so many chances to take the lead but in the end their defense was too bad to stop the Heats offense which was also not that great. Good job by butler, vincent and Bam who held us off, hopefully the Knicks could pull an impossible and win games 4 and 5.
Lets go 🔥
What i love about the heat they play cohesive ball they so disciplin and condition that is a beuaty wathing them play they use everything in the book to win there IQ IS A+ playing off screen boxing out anticipating passes rebounding getting back THERE THE FULL PACKAGE OF A CHAMPION WICH THEM TH BEST / GREAT GAME KNICKS AM PROUD OF YOU GUY YOU WENT BEYOND THE  CALL OF DUTY...KUDOS OF GRATITUDE ..MY RESPECT
let's go, heat!
Steven A Smith, man Jimmy Butler is special.....😆
its a dunk party from the miami🎉
Nice Game My Heat❤😊
Should be a sweep if new York ref never cheated last game
If Jimmy was present in game 2, it could've been game over for the Knicks now.
I hope this is our year again
The referees were inconsistent and Miami flops all over the place.  That said, they pass beautifully and my Knicks can't seem to solve their puzzle offensively and deserve to win the series.
Heat is lock in for the chip
heat vs lakers... rematch
Heat vs. Lakers in Final they so Play Well defensively
Miami people  don’t deserve this team. Empty arena. WTF
New York just letting them score no fight
Carry the hell on, whoever wins, lakers in 4!!
miami lookin good
Heat!!!!!
Caleb Martin my man……Why you did em like that Sheeeeeeesh 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Heat fans are always late to the game, even in the playoffs 😂
Miami in 5
As I begin to watch this replay, I recall the last one where Love's full court passing showed incredible strength and touch as I saw it displayed again just on an inbounds pass. Moments later, he makes another signature full court pass (only Jokic compares) for a Jimmy Bucket. He can shoot too. I'm only 1:47 into this.
Lmao Robinson being salty at the end
thanks, our angels-for the "erla/or herla/or inri and emma(watson)" nere, and all the "magic powers that are kepler kepler kepler keplerkepler worlds paradises"!
Bryson's nick name should be Midus he's got that touch
Bye Knicks
is grimes an NBA player? his shots are barely grazing the ring. embarrassing.
so happy to see kyle lowry get another shot at another ring , hope the heat can come through for jimmy buckets and kyle
I toughy Scott Foster was bad but Heat had 3 refs with heat jerseys, they called 100 fouls on NY in this game
LAL vs MIA disney ring the sequel co9min up
Born and raised is Queens My Knicks are Soft AF
Julius Randle's pouty body language after any mishap is annoying af
Heat Lakers Part 2
1:26 Love is a nba legend at outlet passes
The Knicks clearly aren’t interested in winning. Most those offensive rebounds the heat were getting they didn’t even have to work that hard for. Disgusting
I've been a Heat fan since 2005. These past 4 years with Jimmy Butler have been so of the most fun I have had as a fan. This team plays together , and the culture is unmatched. Everyone plays their role. I really hope this is finally the year we win the chip with this crew , ngl it is more rewarding doing this as underdogs and outcasts compared to the Big 3 days when everyone hated on us and had big expectations.I really feel like Jimmy is gonna lead the team through it all , as we have already experienced Finals disappointment. If we keep playing like this , even after sleeping all regular season , the Heat will defeat Boston or Philly and will get revenge on the Lakers for the championship. MIAMI HEAT 2023 CHAMPS SOON.
Let D-Rose play in game 5......give him a chance to prove himself
Im getting rid of Randle.
The heat vs the Lakers in the final once again 😁😁
If suns beat lakers n face Miami in the finals Jimmy gonna put the dog on Kd lol 😂 lowry on Booker  Gon love this cuz Miami can actually pull it off
1:24. Watching your shot. Not following your shot. Admiring your nice shot. Letting your man cherry pick. Whoops.
Nag oofer si Lord sa lahat ng Pagmamahal, Pagpapatawad, bagong Buhay na wala ng pain at Buhay na walang hanggan sa langit. At iyong mga taong lamang na makakapasok dito ay iyong mga taong Nagtitiwala, nanampalataya, at tumalikod na sa pamumuhay sa kasalanan.  Kailangan nating piliin si Lord at sumunod sa Buhay na gusto niyang mangyari sa atin. Mamatay man tayo balang araw may Pangako Ang Diyos na bubuhayin Niya tayo at dadalhin sa kanyang kaharian.
That’s some BS
Miami heat fan since 2007 until. Let's go HEAT .. 💪💪💪
Heat vs lakers nba finals rematch 😯
Proud to be a heat fan🔥
As a Cavs fan this is super embarrassing. I knew the Knicks sucked but they're getting son'd by the 8 seed🤣🤣  My boys literally couldn't be softer. Such a disappointment.   And to add insult to injury KLove is playing great. Rebounding and hitting 3s.   We could of used some of that.
what happened to randle
Lakers vs heat In finals lakers in 6 like 2020
Let's Go Heat!!!
It's gonna be another Celtics v Heat on the conference finals
The crazy thing is i could see a world where this heat team takes down 2 number 1 seeds. Bam is a nightmare for both the 76ers and the nuggets
This series is over with let's go Heat
Yesss big win for miami heat
The nba needs to ban from teams like this from not trying in the regular season. This is outrageous
Kevin love must be happy because he would’ve retired if he was still wit the cavs but now his new coach using him just right 😭😭  If he wins a ring he should flex it wit all necessary means
Bam going to have some blisters from all those dunks lol! Heat looking like they don't know they're the 8th seed and about to go into the finals!
Heat - Lakers REMATCH!!
Probably Jimmy Butler somewhere: “I stroke to the east, I stroke it to the west, I stroke to the one that I love the best! I be STROKIN!”
Idk if its just me but I am not surprised the Heat are killing it in the playoffs. With a player like Butler on your team you're gonna win.
Knicks still winning the series history gonna happen
Knicks in game 7
I said it all year long... Tyler Herro in the starting lineup took too much away from the rest of the team. We play much better team basketball when everyone's getting more touches and sharing the ball and he's not in there trying to be a showoff all the time.
The nba has 2 coaches of the year brown/ spolestra 🔥 go from the play in tournament to the eastern conference finals. Nobody saw this coming. Playoff jimmy is real. No cap
Yu win quarters , yu win games
K Love's full court dishes never gets old
Go heat
The way the Knicks is losing is a normal thing they always find that way to lose when everything’s on the line these past couple of games Heart has been playing like a bum I knew he was gonna choke big time after that bad interview he did with Brunson. I remember the way Brunson was looking at Heart with disappointment I knew then Heart wasn’t serious enough to perform at a high-level
8 seed in ecf?  👇👇👇
Empty seats in Miami for a playoff game, what the hell going on???
HIMMY BUCKETS!!!!
Draymond is the bum I knew he was
L for the heat fans how are some seats empty ....... Here in Sac we had it SOLD and PACKED OUT,  people watching outside the arena it was so packed .
I'm so glad we got rid of russ
NY got that big ass dude ain’t don’t use him, defence is trash
What a great game Miami pulled out the win and lead the series 3 to 1 and can wrap it up
So the HEAT are saving this "Poetry in Motion" plays for the playoffs.
LETS FING GOOOO ❤
Himmy jimmy. The play deperation pushed them. Need hero win ship tho
LET'S GO HEAT DADE COUNTY MURDA GARDENS<<<
That Martin dunk at 4:20 in the fourth was NASTY!
The Heat are looking great right now!
I am proud of this heat team.
As a knicks fan i dont feel as bad about this lost as compared to game 3 . i felt like with this one a few less mistakes and more makes and the knicks could have won this game. Game 3 they looked completely outmatched like no shot imo
Randle & Robinson DON’T want it! 🤦🏽‍♂️  They aren’t dominating like they should be!
The knicks really thought theyre better than the bucks. Bucks had it down to bad decission when they lost, knicks just plain out-talented.
I is buffering way too much and I am getting today upset with there service. I have been a customer of there more than 10 years straight
Imagine a Lakers Heat Finals 😆
knicks are shit
If Randle got the mindset of Bronson that is attacking the ring than playing 3-ball, NYK might have made this a 2-2 game
Yo where is Miami’s crowd at???
The Knicks should move on from Randle. The guy is not built for the playoffs.
the knicks were yet again....abysmal in game 4. they played slightly better in the first half with more offensive flow and pacing, but of course julius randle has to make so many unforced turnovers and poor decisions. pair that sh*t up with barrett and you got dumb and dumber. the lack of offensive rebounding decimated the knicks as well tonight. i feel terrible for brunson because he has to do everything and this game of basketball is a team sport. i am so fed up with the knicks. randle, barrett...these guys arent the face of the knicks franchise. they aren't money players. scoring 30, 40+ in regular season doesn't mean squat until it comes crunch time. you guys disgust me. i seriously hope we make a move from giannis for next season and trade every freakin player on the knicks (excluding brunson and mitchell robinson). the starks, derek harper, ewing, oakley, LJ, allan houston, sprewell era is making me nostalgic....god how i miss those og's.
Song name?
Not saying Heat in Final coz it's not yet over. But 😊 Heat is 3-1  now.  And chances are high for them to Advance in ECF Final Gets? 😊😊😊😊
Knicks are a puppy. While the heat are this hound, out on the loose.   Knicks fans  are mighty quiet now 😂
Hemi buckets
Oh Well The Knicks really dont want to make it to the next round they been out played by Miami. They wont make it to the next Round with the lack of Defense of Julius Randle. They need to trade him
I been saying this since both team won the 1st round..LA vs MIA Finals… in my Deebo voice THIS THE REMATCH. I been waiting for 😩🙏🏾💯
Fuck yeah go miami go new york fuck yeahh! Woooooooo
Suns vs Heat 2023 NBA Finals
Miami is taking advantage of the big whole in the defense when Julius Randle does not hustle back & the offensive rebounds. Ever since he been back the Knicks lost the edge. It's over for them & Randle wont care😅
@1:05 TRAVEL INTERNATIONAL!!!!
I know the Knicks are the worst team but still surprised Heat cooking them like they are.
Knicks fans be like: No scott foster? 😟😭😭😭
These undrafted heat players play with a chip on their shoulder like Max Struss and Caleb Martin. The culture that miami cultivates within their team is like the modern day spurs. What's nice is that after a hard day's work, you're near Miami beach.
we might get a bubble rematch??
This team deserves to win this year.  They are maximizing their skills. Compared to other teams full of talented squads who stand are the 3 point line waiting for pass not playing Defense by standing around.
Knicks playing uninspired basketball all series
Lakers and heat playing like they WANT IT ….. Boston get ya shit together … ECF rematch would be love
The Heat are playing some of the best basketball I’ve seen in a long time. No team in the western conference looks as good as they do rn. If they keep this up they’ll take it home 100%
Not surprising that all the talking heads didnt know what they were talking about during the regular season,for almost every team who are winning these playoff series..
The Knicks outgrew Thomas Thibodeau Jr. We need a better coach, this game hurt to watch from start to end.
Jimmy buckets 💚
Its crazy, there is just Butler and role players and they look like world beaters.  I think the Celtics would be a wake up call and sweep them.
Wow
Eric Spolstra should get consideration for best coach in NBA.
*Can't believed my Knicks losing to an injured team WTF*
nah im done knicks is ass fr..
Ny defense is wack!
Let’s go heat, get another title.
Heat Lakers NBA finals matchup?
I know Jimmy butler is the heat's best player but kevin love is the swiss army knife of this team. I'm glad he came to the heat, much better fit than he was as Cleveland "this year"
Give it up LBJ n The Boyz Is Cuming...
Randle play lazy on defense
The heat might become the first ever 8 seed to win a championship!
Miami lost to Atlanta in the play-in game and now they are going to the ECF.
Knicks are terrible. Thibodeau is trash.
Miami Heat are the definition of Underdogs. Scratched the bottom of the play-in to most likely advancing to conference finals. Amazing
fullest heat arena
Miami was dropping dimes
Let's go heat🔥
Accept it or not, Heat is becoming a huge franchise.
this will be a heat  vs celtics
Bro forgot to dribble at 1:03 lol
I'm a Heat fan but I can't help but feel bad for Brunson. He's out there giving it his all while his teammates play 0 defense, let offensive boards go and Julius Randle plays 1 on 1 every time he gets the ball.
Heat home games always look empty bruh😂
Heat vs Celtics Rematch...
Why was the arena so empty
From Bum Adebayo to BAM! Adebayo!
Me being a Bulls fan and seeing how Jimmy G Buckets playing winning basketball and still putting in work especially in the playoffs brings a smile to us. We miss him😢😢
Both Fournier and DRose should play. They are experienced playoff players.
Spolestra is really good at making adjustments. The Heat were putting so much pressure at the start forcing all those turnover. They made Brunson life difficult.
Miami 🏝 kept taken advantage that the lower post, because they realized that the (Knicks 🏔 wasn't playing any defense at all periodically.
The (Knicks 🥶 doesn't deserve to win this playoff round.  Because no one in this team has no energy to play defense at all once so ever.  Miami 🏝was scoring to many easy baskets 🏀 on the lower post.. from beginning to end. Wowwwwwww,
We are not a regular 8 seed team
Knicks missing all of them boards  🤦
only scott foster can save knicks
lakers heat rematchhh
RIP worriers
HIMMY BUTLERRRRR
RJ is really carrying his knicks franchise but Jimmy is just different
You know damn well the referees calling all the fouls on the Nicks and NONE ON THE HEAT. The league needs to fine these referees 😡🤬
Man the duo, butler and adebayo
Caleb martins is a machine
not to sound like a sore winner but omg did the refs let brunson get away with so many push offs on vincent and props to gabe for still making brunson really have to work tonight
That 4th quarter gotta be absolute hell to witness if you're a Knicks fan..just out there giving Miami long ass possessions cause they simply cannot get defensive rebounds 😬
Mia vs LAL
Booker is better than overated Butler
🏀🏀🏀👍🏼 podcasting check us out
Anybody else think Kevin love playing the wrong sport😂
basketball is the most unfair sport
Heat play team basketball.... But I'm very disappointed in the Knicks
bravo!!!!
*A rematch of Heat and Lakers are looming*
Lakers vs Warriors game 4 is the best game of the playoffs!
Yo why is Tyler herro dress like Eminem off 8 mile 😂
Hawks fan but I’m glad the heat going this far…if they get to the finals I’m rotting for em
Spike Lee punching da air rite now..
Tyler out here looking like 8 mile
The knicks need mvp mode d rose on the cort not in the bench😓
Goodbye knicks
too many damm commercials
Julius randle with some of the worst defense I’ve ever seen
JIMMY JORDAN PLAYING LIKE HIS FATHER THE 🐐🐐🐐 MICHAEL JEFFREY JORDAN #23
RJ is buns and Randle is anus water.
This is the most impressive team since the bubble. The defensive adjustments made by Spo and the shooting has been good enough to win games. The Heat have pleasantly surprised me this postseason since that play-in loss to the Hawks.   LET’S GO HEAT
Lakers and Celtics need new refs dude they are so bad bro like legit giving the Lakers and Celtics an advantage and that's legit the only reason the Lakers have won the last two games and the Celtics can basically only win on their home floor so my point is proven nba needs to do something abt this or the nba next year is gonna just be a rage fest for fans due to the refs
knicks look lifeless, no hustle
Playoff Jimmy Buckets. Goddammit
Get humbled obnoxious Knicks fans
Randall again is a burden...
Lakers wariors
1:02 watch as Randle turns the ball over.... then instead of running back on Defense, he flairs his arms and BAM GETS BACK BEFORE HIM TO GET THE REBOUND! WTF RANDLE!!!!!!!!! He is not a Playoff star, regular season sure but not post season made.
I hate the Knicks I'm glad they lost I hope the heat finish them off
Knicks fans complaining about the refs, but the refs are the reason why the Knicks didn't get swept😭
Fuck New York
Love the game the Heat play, everyone on the floor matters 😤 love this team love my boy Jimmy hope this is his year 🙏🏾
3:21 ouffff!!!
Let go heat!!
🎉
The goonz from dade county are snatching up dubs right now, got the NBA media shook right now 💯😈
I'll never understand why the Cavs bought out Kevin Love.. They didnt even replace him with anyone. He's been a key player for the Heat all playoffs. Just makes no sense.
Jimmy want a championship let’s go heat 😎😎😎😎
Yea it's over 4 the Knicks
Poor Knicks defense for two games in a row so obvious i wonder why their coaching staff can't comprehend what's happening...
As a Bulls fan all I can say Is that this Heat team is so badass, savage, and fearless
Crazy black 8, now Heats goes to Eastern Final!
Why was thete so many empty seats???
Heat will most likely advance but I think they will lose in the next round.
White hot baby
Sucks Jimmy played so great but doesn’t have the team to win a championship
Me trying to find a Drose comment 😢
Does anyone know hot to retrieved an account on 1xbet i won on this match up but sadly i cannot open my account it was automatically log out and i don't know my account id nor the password that they give :(
The refs swallowed the whistles AGAIN. The Heat getting gifted at this point
Offensive Rebounds
Wow the Knicks are wild you have a former MVP on the bench and you don’t even utilize him at all. That’s insane.
Is it me or does the stadium look kind of empty for PLAYOFF GAME??
As long as Miami and LA both don't get to the finals, it will be a successful season.  Fuck the NBA.
Max with that steal and charge to give randall his 6th foul, his defense was essential today.
WOW the refs let them beat themselves up. So many non calls.
that was not a shooting foul on bam that was clean he kept his hands up the whole time  3:29
#Heatnation
randle no defense at all
Heat fans like this
We the avengers of the NBA 🦸‍♂️. A super team 💪. Miami gonna finish this off in da garden n buried the Knicks there at their own home😄. We goin 2 da conference finals 💯. Heat all da way 🔥. We got this 🙏🔥💯
those deep threes by Lowry and Strus were ridiculous
Why does the arena look dead kinda sad tbh
😮
Looming 2.0
The Knicks are no match for the Heat but my goodness is the other JB the real deal!
🤣🤣🤣
I’m so glad that the heat won this game and are now up three games to one against the Knicks And I hope that the heat can end the series with the win on Wednesday Against the New York Knicks and I still hope that the NBA finals is the Lakers versus the Miami Heat because I am a very huge LeBron fan!!
My heat 🔥 is on 🔥
The HEAT is on!
Has the 8th seed ever makebthe finals? Bc its possible
Honestly this series should be over already . NY got lucky Jimmy got hurt and missed game 2 . Gentlemen sweep tho  for sure
Let's not forget this team was a shot away from finals last year
I'm getting a 08 pistons vibe from the heat, them boys might do something
I want Brunson!  I want him in a Heat uniform!  That man plays like Tim Hardaway!  <3
No Herro...No Oladipo....  "D'ham!"  Imagine how far the Heat could go if they had full roster force.....
Randle man...He don't have no heart. He stay taking it to the rim just to make a last second pass that most likely will b a turnover.  Knicks losses hurt my head.
DRose and Fournier are better than Grimes and Quickley
NBA is unreal based on how basketball players in the United States were cheated by cable corporations who followed them and sabotaged them, this caused the corruption of the entire country and just the sport of basketball. NBA are the ones who cheated everyone else in basketball the most with corrupt spying by cable tv corporations who cheated us hundreds of trillions of times. NBA is no longer real, NBA is not real basketball.
Grown man team versus some rookies.... Knicks fans, this is what yall get for disrespecting DRose. DRose still the best player on the Knicks lol
Knicks can't shoot for shit.
Stupid Bucks organization shouldn't have fired Bud. The Heat are obviously better than the Bucks. They just had to get by a long regular season. The Heat were not a true number 8 seed. They look like a 3 it 4 seed, while the Bucks looked like a 4 or 5 seed.
what's with the empty seats Miami??
Jimmy "BUCKETS" Butler is a man of focus commitment and has a sheer foooking will , i once saw him beat the 1st seed Bucks in the Playoffs in the fooking playoffs who TF can do that
people getting too ahead of themselves. heat aint even past the 2 rd yet and people praising them for being 8 seed in the finals. hol up ppl lol.
Is it just me, or do the Knicks suck?
Miami again
Playoff jimmy is really about to take them to the ECF from an 8 seed lol the last time this happened I was in diapers lmfao
Play Fournier Thibs, y'all can't shoot. It's not defence its offense that the knicks need. Same problem 2 years ago
What did the Knicks learn on defense from the past two games? Nothing apparently.
I literally went up to random people and said Miami in 5 I need this gentlemen sweep!!!
IF the NBA FINALS is Heat vs Lakers. Its gonna be insane. Rematch of the Bubble
where is toppin'?
"I got 8fs for 25"
Bro randle need to go asap he thinks he a star when he’s not wtf are you shootings 3s for fry some boards and points in the paint then he throwing sloppy passes like come on yo
why was #42 flexing?
The lakers are going to terminate the heat fo sho
This team is on fire 🔥
Ref secures the bet at 8:16 😂
Miami heat
Go Heat ❤❤❤
Only reason I'm salty is because that my knicks.  But I ain't stupid, Jimmy is a beast.  Love that the knicks came this far.  They are no match for his will on the game.  Kudos the the Heats organization.   He bought in.  Knicks has to use this for motivation  next  year.
Why do we have to watch official NBA highlights in 360p?
If Miami just had one more scorer this team would be terrifying. We are winning off of physical endurance and fundamentally sound basketball we only have Jimmy buckets as a true consistent scoring threat and we are one dub from a conference final spot. Let thank sink in.
Randle is a sloppy player all over the place. Doesn’t realize he’s a big man not a guard…
the difference the bench can make is insane
Knicks look cooked.They only got 3 guys playing against a whole team. Josh Hart has really come down to earth.
i think the Heat and Celtics rivalry might happen again
These commentators suck. Wtf
Himmy Butler with 27 pts, and 10 ast, give this man some major praise taking a 3-1 series lead over the Knicks
The heat are such a cheaters I swear I saw multiple BS fouls against the Knicks and it is not a coincidence that Hart , Randle and Jalen were all in foul trouble . Got no respect for the heat
Let’s gooooo
Jimmy buckets pacing himself tonight, he knows  the collective effort of the heat team can beat the knicks. Just like what he saw in game 2 in the sideline. Game 5 he will explode in msg.
Random question but which sports do people in Miami care about for reals? Are they fairweathers or are they legit? I've seen a bunch at Heat and Panthers games, kinds at Dolphins, and nada at Hurricanes and Marlins
mamamia
1:03 how tf theres other 2 heat players in transition and theres no knicks player to even secure the defensive rebound at this turnover. The contest is pretty good but the rest just watch.
No one could stop butler .
This euro traveling is getting out of hand.  Some games they are giving players four steps.
Ugly 👹 4th quarter
Why max 360p? 👁️👄👁️
The Heat  played good but I feel like they tried the knicks I Fell like they wasn’t calling fouls especially for Brunson
That was some old school you coming to work playoff basketball that was beautiful to watch
How many turnovers did Randle have? Turnovers killed the Knicks' chances.
Mitchell fucking Robinson is big for nothing sometimes got damn
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Im a lakers fan for life but mam jimmy buckets is my fav player right now.
The Knicks lost this game when they couldnt get a rebound for like 7 minutes straight...
Can you guys imagine the type of spark ⚡️ electricity it would give this team and fan base, during the playoffs if they just started DROSE!!? Like wth are they thinking, Brunson is cool but rose can facilitate better
If Jimmy didn’t get hurt in game 1 this would’ve been a sweep
Did randal really foul out?
BUTLER AND BAM WENT OFF! GO HEAT!🔥
Poor stephen a smith 😂
1:27 Butler got to feel one of those HEAT LeBron/K Love long range passes.
360p video quality. My lord do they know how to upload properly?
Thibs sucks he should have let drose play in the playoffs coz rose has plenty of playoffs experience
Here for the Bucket Show. 🪣
Not an impressive win.
As I said, NYC is in trouble.
Miami an the whole organization know how to make something out of undrafted players 🔥⚫🔴💯🔐
I think Boston will beat them if we pass 76ers at home
it's so amazing that I am watching 360p videos in 2023!
Adebayo owned the rim tonight
Should've been a clear sweep if jimmy didn't twist his ankle Knicks getting out hustle by the whole heat team got the biggest guys on the court cant get rebound n Randle stealing money thibs mit be let go once the Knicks lose
The Knicks are pathetic as always
If it wasn't for some corrupt officials, this would be Miami 4-0
Head came home and took care of business, one more game baby! 🔥🔥
Got everybody mouth on the floor😂😂😂 told y'all we weren't playing
Bravo and im from new york
BAM! Let’s go heat!
The Heat have more than 1 Hero!! 🔥🦸‍♂️🏀
360p in 2023
What's with the 360p video?
Spoe is basketball genius
Knicks played the no defense tactic again, and have given the heat easy fast breaks n buckets.  Its going to take a miracle now.
Jimmy Buckets is lethal. I don’t think anyone left is going to have the stamina to stop him.
This is an example of "FUCK WHAT YOU THINK I'M JUST GO OUTHERE AND LEAVE ON THE COURT"
Love butler, would love to see the heat win the ECF and advance to the championship game and take home the glory. What a legend that would be. Gotta win one more over knicks take it one day and one game at a time.
never a heat fan, never expected them to have this play-off run, but I enjoy watching them advance.
Thanks to Udonis haslem heat are one win away from the conference finals
If Jimmy Butler and The Heat can win it all this year as an 8th seed, that is the most wholesome satisfying amazing thing would ever happen in basketball. Even if you're not a Heat fan. They deserve everything and lets hope they will continue for Championship.
All I've ever wanted is a ring for James Bucket Doer.
what kind of fuckin quality is this
I just remember how happy Stephen A. was when they gonna face the Heat instead of the Bucks.  They like their chances with the Heat, thinking that Heat's win is a fluke. Knicks vs playoff Jimmy with a bunch of undrafted players looks like a mismatch to me.
How tf did the Knicks make the playoffs, they is trash trash, smh
The nicks should trade for Anthony Edwards, he’s be a good fit just saying.
If this man don't sit Randle.  Why is he automatically a starter and can't slide on defense?
The nicks should trade for Anthony Edwards, he’s be a good fit just saying.
The nicks should trade for Anthony Edwards, he’s be a good fit just saying.
The pressure is actually on Miami for game 5. Not for this series but for the next round. They need to win this and get Jimmy and everyone enough rest to go against Boston or Philly which is likely going 7
give credit to coach spo, he also step-up bigtime in this playoffs....
My Heat Will be a champ this season.. Lets go Miami
I'm sick of watching Julius randle. That lazy pass to Brunson that got stolen was on him and instead of hustling back he standing around with his hands in the air. Fk him
Man, the Heat is playing beautiful basketball. Look at all those beautiful assists they keep making.
Why is this video 360p?
Jimmy Butler is the Monkey D Luffy of the NBA.
Brunson has a very Derrick Rose like style of play.  Very athletic
Bam bringing back the dunk!
305🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Jimmy bucket is a dangerous man 🔥 🔥 🔥
Where’s Jimmy’s first block????
Goddam, everyone in that heat roster can shoot the ball. LMAO They've got hidden gems from gleague
Can't imagine what it must feel like to know refs are the only reason you're still in the playoffs and still have no hope. Good thing I'm a Heat fan.
Uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh
Knicks in 7 😜😝😜
Knicks doodoo 😂
Can't wait to see Steven A. Smith cry like a little B**** tomorrow. That's what you get for gloating about a first round win.
1:28 I'll never get enough of Kevin Love's touchdown passes. What a guy.
How the hell are the Heat doing so good in the playoffs when one of their best players (Herro) and their main role player (Oladipo) are out with injury, and they were only mediocre in the regular season? That's crazy.
Im not a knicks fan at all but if they want do better they have to get rid of Julius Randle period..
Vincent, Strus and Martin Knicks nightmare
The heat Vs lakers the 8th seed vs the 7th would be wild
stupid Knicks! 😅🤣
WE BACK BABY ON 🔝   LET'S GO HEAT 🔥🔥
Kicks were  so clumsy in the fourth quarter unable to grab rebounds, they should give up and retire from basketball.  They lack focus and crumble  like btch’s
Julius randle is not who he thinks he is🤦🏾‍♂️ lack of effort, no energy on rebounds, but expects the ball almost every possession. I’m disappointed in him!! He is killing that team.
Its crazy the heat is just a team full of bums doing the most with all this ref help
Nobody's gonna talk about Caleb Martin's performance?
the only way the Knicks will ever win a championship Is when Spike Lee dies
Heat vs Gsw in finals
The fucking New York Knicks are sorry they’re a fucking disgrace to the Mecca can even get a fucking W.
"Don't nobody do it like Miami does" - Rick Ross 🔥😎
As a Knicks fan.  Heat ain’t winning no chip. :)   And y’all ain’t getting past the ecf.
Let's go 305 !!!!! DADE COUNTY STAND UP
As fan of no team, I am rooting all the way for Jimmy Butler only. He deserves a ship frfr
The heat are a game away from making the ECF that's insane, I will say this tho they kind of ruined the playoffs some what by eliminating Gianni's and the bucks I mean no one wants to see jimmy butler and a bunch of players no one knows in the ECF or the finals it's to bad giannis got hurt these playoffs views and ratings would be so much better if the bucks were still playing
miami and gsw for finalss
"Wait til Randle comes back"  Wth would he do? Ohhh scaryy
whatever happens i'm proud of the Knicks - hopefully next few games Mitch & Hart focus more on rebounding & stay out of foul trouble. Happy to see Grimes get 40 min.
Miami is playing with house money
NY players getting a harsh lesson in what it takes to become a Champion. They are playing at 92% while the Heat are playing at 102%.
🔥 Go Miami 🔥
The Knicks really talked all that trash to get gentlemen swept?
Jimmy Jordan for sure champ this year
Miami heat #BelieveTheImpossible🫡
i know Caleb is an all star. he just need more playtime focus.,
the HEAT is ON!
Miami is not scared of this team
This heat team is not even at it strongest and they still beating you guys dam
I believe the heat going to win The nba championship no one can beat them
Put Toppin on Butler
Seems like Randle shrinks in the playoffs
Our MIAMU HEAT is on track, the road to NBA finals. The more Hungerier we will get more, "WIN ON THE TOP HEAT NATION"❤💯🏀💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪🏅🏆
These uniforms confused me
1:27 Love doing what he does best.
Let's go new York Knicks
if anyone deserves to win a chip its jimmy buckets. I hope lady luck will be with miami this year
8:58 The Deuce 😂😂
Knicks getting slammed like Charlie Ward did back in late 90s. 🤪
LET’S GOOOOO!!! 🔥Heat🔥 Culture……plain and simple! Miami in 🖐️!!!
Miami Coach is out coaching New York coach.
😱
Bro the Knicks are so soft man. No blocking out, no chasing loose balls, they look like they gave up before halftime. And let’s not even talk about their free throws. Other then Brunson there’s never a trip to the line where they make both shots
Its sad to see so many empty seats 😢😢
As a Bucks fan I'm pulling for Miami all the way!
Get my boy Rose out of NY.
Knicks vs Refs
jimmy butler and max strus are not human they are from other planet they're alien playing basketball 😂 go heat for another upset 4-1
Miami might go to the NBA Finals!
bitch, NBA writers think they good. They want a LAL-MIA finals again for the weather.
Thibs never makes adjustments. Start there. Randle is a liability. Need a new coach. That will use the line up correctly!!!!
Heat all the way 🏆
You know as a basketball fan and a fan of the Knicks it’s really frustrating when certain things about your team completely fade in the playoffs. The whole season it was “oh the Knicks have a deep team, there bench is so deep😒. They play with so much hustle😒.” Now all of a sudden that so called deep team plays like the Charlotte bobcats. The reason we were playing well this season was cause our bench played above expectations every game to the point where it became an expectation. It’s really aggravating knowing throughout the season our bench would come in and give us 25 to 30 and know these niggas disappear and give us what 8-10. Pathetic for a so called deep team. I’m not even gonna go in a randle. Get that nigga out here I hate watching him play. Nigga plays that the dumb ass so on 2k putting up reckless bull shot every play. Nigga acts like he’s not 6,9 pure muscle out here playing like a bitch taking fading long twos. Just get him out man. And holy fuck we need an athletic big man like Nic Claxton cause if I see Mitch rob hiff and puff in slow motion up the court a few more times I’m gonna lose it if I haven’t already. Mitch rob all of sudden has turned into a cone in the paint. No effort. Claxton would be perfect. Fuck this team. Gg Miami. I wasn’t one of the people thinking this would easy. I just thought our team would come out and at least give us more than 1 good game.
Pitiful
Didn't Jimmy Butler Tweet Heat In 5 wow Jimmy Buckets is an amazing player Top 5 for sure.
Lets go heat ❤🤍🔥 hope we make it to the finals 🙏
Jimmy Jordan!!!!  MIKE CLAIM YOUR SON!!!  Be a father  to Jimmy!! 😄
Maybe ny needs porzingis back
The Knicks tried all their best to lose this game. I feel for Brunson. How can Lowry be grabbing offensive rebounds when he is the shortest guy on the floor. So many rookie mistakes, damn. Too much talent on the knicks but you would think it’s their first playoff.
Heat outrebounded the Knicks 44-35. That was the difference in the game.
Suns winning it all
Antedebayou > Randle
9 more wins and the job is done, lets go HEAT!!! 🔥 🔥 🏀 🏀
Love the way Jimmy Butler plays basketball.
1:27 K-Love Outlet Pass 🤯
Miami heat is the new Toronto raptors 2019
Bum Adebayo finally stepped up
Yall save yall money on betting and just enjoy the game. Betting changing the way these theieves call the game.
Jimmy Butler has been the best player in this series. He's been very consistent. I dare say he's been one of the best players in these Playoffs as a whole.
As a Cavs fan, I'm happy K Love is still in the playoffs with the Heat! And who would have thought that the Heat will go this far in the playoffs! They show out when it matters! Nothing  but respect for the Heat!!!
THE GAME IS FIXED FOR MIAMI NBA IS FIXED MY GUYS 💯💯💯 WAKE UP NBA A 🗑️🗑️🗑️ LEAGUE ITS FIXED 🤮🤮🤮
Kevin lowflop and the Miami floppers have full control of the refs and the series, let's see how the Knicks respond!!
Heat in 5
Jimmy Butler: 27pts (9-17 FGM, 1-3 3PM, 8-9 FTM) 6 Rebs 10 Asts 2 STLs 2 BLKs
Its over
3 Villanova players in the playoffs
These state farm commercials are fukin annoying!
New York Who? 😂
BAN BAM BAM out the gate‼️
Jimmy butler is the closest we can see michael jordan today
I thought Bam Adebayo gave the Miami Heat good minutes tonight.
can we stop with the idea that the nba is better off when the Knicks are good? knicks have been bad for more than 2 decades and the NBA has only grown in popularity   knicks are like the cowboys , their press exceeds their actual accomplishments
Dont matter which team u a fan of real basketball fans can agree that the Refs came thru for Miami. Most betting fans picked knicks in this game and NBA and its affiliates cashed in.
I hope heat will going to make it till the finals they are really good tem
This Knicks team lacks heart.
Bro Randles energy in negative moments is irritating. I can only imagine how frustrating it is seeing him flail his arm and look visibly  upset at every small mistake. How do you rally behind someone like that as team?
😢should’ve played D rose 🌹
How do New Yorkers have the audacity to call this a rivalry 😂🤣 LET'S GO HEAT 🔥 💯
Jimmy Butler making sure this Heat team gets to the ECG through sheer will
Wow. Heat is on fire and making history
Stick a fork in it Wednesday heat moving on
Miami Heat:3 🔴⚫️⚪️🔥☀️🏖🌇  New York Knicks:1 🟠🔵⚪️🏙🗽 Game 5 Wednesday 7:30pm on TNT in New York
Why does the Miami crowd seem so boring?
*Lets go Heat🔥🔥*
Heat are a machine in the playoffs
I wish the Heats can win the champion this year. That's the teamwork basketball game that I want to see it.
The refs seemed like they were getting paid
Last year, the Heat were one shot away from going to the finals. But hey, all I heard in Heat-Bucks series was the Heat were 8th beating 1 seed. I wonder why nobody is talking about 8th seed walking down 5th seed. All this just was to make Giannis look bad even though Giannis played injured? Where is Stephen A. Smith talking about 8th seed beating 5th seed?
I wish NY would just forfeit game 5...they owe us that after the Scott Foster gift
1 to go😂
Knicks fan here - Heat are the better team by 100% but holy damn, the calls were extremely one sided today. EVERY SINGLE foul was in the heats favor. Our whole starters had 5 fouls. Jimmy doesn't even look like hes trying and i knew we'd lose ever since that game 2 smile. The knicks seriously need to guard the perimeter better and not get intimidated by the heats defense on brunson
Wheres the knicks in 5 at
Is Miami going to be the Detroit Pistons of 2004 of 04?
It’s not over but time is closing in for an opportunity to win the series. As a knicks fan the problem they’re struggling with is shot selection and poor defense. It’s sad bc Herro & Vic ain’t playing and we making every heat player look like all stars. We did horrible with defense & rebounding this game and too many turnovers. They needa play Obi a lil bit more because Randle is forcing shots he shouldn’t be
Let Go Heat!!!...Jimmy Buckets For President 🪣
Finally bam showed up for a game 23 pts 13 reb 10-17 Fg should be doing this every game so jimmy dont have to carry such a huge load
Mitchell Robinson moves like a 7 foot muppet
I'm so disappointed in the damn knicks.  They have more than enough to beat Miami
1st seed or 8th seed. Still going to the ECF
I been waiting on this one🤩🤩
Let's go heat
Bro the heat are growing on me. Never was a fan but holy this team is a playoff machine. Jimmy Butler proving he’s top 5 nba player right now. Give this man the respect he deserves im getting a jersey for sure. Heat jerseys are also fire asf
lol they could literally make it to the finals
It's 2023, the NBA is a multibillion dollar business and they're still uploading highlights in 360p
Bam was awesome this game, finally stepped up when the heat needed him and Jimmy buckets doing Jimmy bucket things, let's go heat🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I told suckas the Knicks aint getting 1 in MIA! I told sucka JuLius RandaLLwon't make a difference. Heat in 5 as predicted.
Same Heat fans crying about the refs in game 2 are happy now 😂😂
Jimmy jordan stay playing at another level that only book and him have got to this playoffs 27 pts 6 reb 10 ast 9-17 Fg
NBA Refs are a joke these days..... no one keeps them accountable.
Pabalik2x naman video mo.
Heat on fire 🔥
Kyle Lowery flopped the whole game. Kyle Lowery got calls against the Knicks for flopping.  The NBA REFEREES handed that game to Miami Heat. Kyle Lowery and the Refs are a pieces of garbage.
heat deserved this easy 2nd round after beating the bucks.
We can agree Knicks will need to improve this off season, they improved but this was clearly a lesson to be taught. Bronson is the only keeper .
If it wasn’t for that MONSTER game to by Scott Foster for the Knicks this would have been a SWEEEEEEP EASILY!! Hahahahaaa Knicks such trash. Stop moving to Florida you BUMS!!
Stephen a Smith sick right now 😂😂😂😂
Adebayo - 23 points, 13 rebounds💪💪
Heat vs Suns NBA Finals 🔥 👀
Knicks fans salt level: industrial accident https://youtu.be/UT00dDCXj_s
The fact that Jimmy Butler's like 40% out their playing is  amazing but the fact that he got up so high the block that shot is even more amazing and the fact that butler been getting double team a lot more series than last
where are the knicks fans bragging about the 3 wins over Heat in the regular season?  They are shutting up real fast aren't they?
Like i keep saying heat in 5
Jimmy = Himmy
Heat will be out for blood next game.
This heat team just keeps getting 💪 together first it was just jimmy jordan now everyone is performing
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Someone send me those videos of Knicks fans screaming into the cameras acting like clowns over a 1st round win 😂😂 Poverty Franchise and Fanbase
Bruh after I saw Jimmy smiling after game two I knew he was gonna beat the knicks ass
Heat in 5!
The Knicks players complaining about the refs was poetic justice for game 2. Justice has been served!
its over
The way you know the Heat played a team game is that, in only an 8-point win, not a single one of their ten players on the court had a negative box score plus/minus figure. And none of the Knicks had a positive plus/minus figure, except M. Robinson with +1.
Love the way Jimmy plays ball
Knicks fans really thought they was about to go to the Eastern conference finals. 😭😭
first
Julius Randle gettin Trampled Knicks fans in Shambles The Miami bench setting a prime Example Heat in 5 🔥🔥🔥
The heat are really gonna back to back conference finals despite a worst seeding
Julius Randle has had an efficient night shooting, but he’s got to also realize that there’s other ways to help his team win playoff games. Get those rebounds, not getting in foul trouble, not looking to the officials to give him calls. This is why the Knicks are struggling, he’s become their big variable, because he’s looking for excuses to not do more than just score. The Knicks are in big, big trouble in this series
Julius Randle really not built for the postseason
Weres all the knicks fans at now talking about knicks in 5 😂😂😂 maybe in 10 years
Man the heat are not playing around. They are making sure that they are going to win the finals. If they are able to keep playing with defense and scoring than it is very likely that they will win it all.

Wow
No Herro, no Oladipo? NO PROBLEM !!!!!!! Ladies and gentlemen, our Miami Heat (the GREATEST team in the league) with a DOMINATING triumph. MIA in 5, and then we're off to SWEEP either Loston or PhiLadeLphia! I'm SO PUMPED for the squad in June to hoist that FOURTH NBA Finals championship and start one HECK of a dynasty.   Jimmy Butler III ... folks, he's the REAL Most Valuable Player of the League and GREATEST player in basketball history! The 33-year-old from Houston, Texas leads the squad with a MASSIVE double-double of 27 points and 10 assists.   Edrice Femi "Bam" Adebayo, showing the world why he is the GREATEST center in the league! The 25-year-old from Newark, New Jersey has the JAW-DROPPING double-double of 23 points and 13 rebounds. Haven't seen a CLUTCH stat line from a big man since Shaq!   Max Strus, the JUICE IS LOOSE ... the 27-year-old from Hickory Hills, Illinois has 16 FEROCIOUS points.   Kyle Terrell Lowry, the VETERAN ! The 37-year-old from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania puts up 15 MONSTER points. He's ready to win another ring, but THIS TIME with a REAL team!   LET'S GO HEAT !!!!! #HEATCulture
