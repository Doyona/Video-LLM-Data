Gk ada yang mau beli son nih tim-tim besar?
It’s not surprising Son scores with any room given. What is surprising every time is the beauty of his goals.
배뎃들 거의다 한국인이네ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 개웃기누
사랑한다! 쏜!
Son Masterclass ❤

The best starting eleven

Madison needs to know the "Team Play."  Mad cannot win ANY without a team play or be like his prodecessor K and take the T back 17 C.  Mad -  Be a team player.  If not,  please go back to where U came from rather than mess up a good team.

What a great performance from Tottenham Hotspur.. Have a nice day.. :-)
they should show at least one more replay for each goal.. 😢
Respect Captain.....M!!!!
Richarlison needs to be replaced. This guy is useless since he arrived.
SOn in mancity be so perfect
Ambil🔥 0:04
Son's dad said that he is not world class just yet. Must work harder. 😅
Love spurs
Coys

Love this squad
Stupid goal keeper.  He give the ball 2 times same actions 🎬
Please send to me BNB (bep20) 0xe92ba11c2bce62e29e01989fd7c72e490f0b564a Thank You..
What does that celebration mean?
2 nearly identical goals
토트넘이 압박을이리 잘하게 되다니 감동
son is great as always but the saves from Vicario tho.. what a save
Sonaldo asian
Son! Let's score 30 goals!
Son and madison are on fire this season🫡🫡
진짜 토트넘 우승할려는듯..
Ricarlison son masison
son good~~
우승 가즈아~~아스날 망해라! ㅋ
Few players are as consistent in the Premier League as Son. What an amazing player
No Feeling, Ange Is Angel
Vicario is amazing🧤
Son
MAD ❤ SON
Why is the video quality so bad???
둘이 세레머니 똑같이하네ㅋㅋ
video quality is pretty mediocre
캬
Son had chance to second goal but passed to Maddison. What a team player.
손흥민❤️🇰🇷
MaddiSon
480p is the best you could do ?
Every comment  is *that player is world class* their all world class like there isnt a higher level then this unless you count the chamipons league
Legacy of Keptan Sonny. What spurs really needed. 👏🏻
Will Son7 (SHM7) ever be headhunted to go Real Madrid?
빛카리오!!
토트넘이 1위 못했던건 여태 케인 때문이었음. 케인이 적폐였음. 케인때문에 케인이랑 친한 실력도 없는 요리스나 다이어 끼고 몇 년을 리그 경쟁 했기 때문에 그 모냥이 난거임
There is something different about this Spurs
Respect 🎉🎉🎉
COYS!!!!!!!!
Son is world class he's on fire 🔥🔥 Halland and Salah should be worried for this season golden boot he is very consistent scoring week in week out 👏👏
Son is a master class😊
Sonny middle shoot is just outstanding
Sssssssssssssssssooooooooooooooonnnnnnnyyyyyyyyyyyy!
Their pressing is somerhing else.
Is my phone bugging or frame rate trash by official Hotspurs 😂
Sonsational! People doubted about Son being the Ace for the Spurs. Sonny let's have another one!
Son, cómo te amo condenado :3 (y el portero quién es, Courtois? 2 buenas atajadas)
첫.골 오프사이.드 잖아ㅡㅡ
son is offside
SON! unbelievable!
Vicario is so important for this team right now. He has done a lot of incredible saves this season.
Both of goals fulham error hahah
Even in Real Life this guy is abusing his finesse shot Playstyle+ as in FC 24
They seem to be on point this season
Sonaldo
Spurs goalkeeper is God Mode
thank you postegoglu he is the goat manager right now, better than everyone including pep
Son ❤
🥰👍❤️ I'm happy to see them shining, a perfect team.‼️
Son has definitely stepped up since Harry Kane left
WE’RE THE TOTTENHAM BOYS, MAKING ALL THE NOISE  EVERYWHERE WE GOOO
Sơn ........
😁😁😁😁😁😁😁🥶🥶🥶😬😬😬
maddison should be more respectful to his captain... they didnt include it in the highlights when they both got clashed into each other because sonny was in front of him and maddison went past his way where Son thought was a pass so he took it to score and maddison got mad cos he thought Son stole the ball off him. Maybe these two don't have it yet as a duo, only Son does as he has done mostly everything.
Sonny only score bangers
손 압박 비카리오 선방

What a super goal and assist by Sonny!!!
Vicario is just AMAZING
0:50 what a beautiful fainting motion. play it 0.5 times speed.
Son❤
Hello❤
🔥🔥🔥
Coys are fire this season 🔥
WE WILL WIN THIS TITLE THIS IS OUR TIME❤ LETS GO SPURS FANS
Son is just Ridiculous. What a Legend.
Just imagine if spurs win the league😂
Tot best time
son is a world class player
Manchester united should buy son next year
👌 trophy for this year😂
Cukurukukk..empukk jerruuuukk...🦢☝️
son wasnt offside??
The no.1 Korean Guy
maddi + son
Paul Merson said Son is in no way a centre forward,what a fool that man is.
Liverpool better than Tottenham
Mitoma is better than Son 😂 Japanese skills are world class😊
Son’s pressures against the goalie started a short chain reaction to result in the ball turnover, which then immediately translated into goals on both scores. Amazing tactic!
한때는 맨유가 세계 최강이었는데. 바르셀로나도 한 물 가버렸고. 절대강자들이 몰락한 복잡한 세상이네
god of son
Sonaldo
We are winning the league
“Son is better player than overrated penaldo”, someone wrote this. Am inclined to believe it
In my  head  sonny sonny ❤❤😂
우승 가자
https://youtube.com/shorts/2HfHSm26Pvw?si=ypkYWEALdN1INmhG
Bàn thắng thứ 2 Son hoàn toàn có thể ghi bàn nhưng là 1 đội trưởng anh ta có trách nhiệm đưa đồng đôi của mình cùng thăng hoa…
Son has a crazy percentage of scoring when ever he shoot the ball.... i have seen it many times
Sonny is world class no doubt
I don’t understand why Sonny isn’t taking the free kicks?! 😠He does a great job for South Korea!
Am not a spurs fan but you lads are winning these league
1:03 아웃 스탠딩 발음 겁나 쫀득하이 맛잇네
Mano, agradeço a tudo que o Kane fez por esse time mais sem ele parece que estamos muito melhor.
I don't understand why Vicario doesn't play for Italy. Good for Spurs to have such a goalkeeper.
내가 장담하는데 토트넘  이 캐미 메디슨이 망가트린다 저놈 욕심 만땅인 놈이다 케인보다 더 욕심부리는놈이다  능력에 비해서 욕심이 더 넘처나는~  나같은 백퍼  내가 흥민이같으면 엉켰을때  욕 박았다 어디 굴러온 새퀴가 이제 그만 참아라 이 바보야
멋진 토트넘 팀이네요.
Come on you Spurs!
Son should leave tottenham. Tottenham and the fans will never get son anywhere
son was off
is nomuhyun dead?
토트넘 선수들 너무 잘한다. 한마음 한뜻으로 서로를 믿고 따른다. 주장 손흥민을 비롯 모든 선수 화이팅
Both goal son press gk and got a goal
In this case, it's Polham's trick.  Polham tried to come back after 3-0.  This is a production.  Because it had to live up to the expectations of the Hootspur audience.Soni was cast as the lead role.😊
😂 like Arsenal come January, they start breaking down 😂
Son is a machine 🤞
If spurs win the PL and Bayern not the BL then we all know that a trophy is not written in Kane's destination.
Maddi'Son'  !!!!!!!
메디슨은 좀 더 겸손해지고 소니는 좀 더 이기적이 되길.
비카리오 또한 승리의 주역
Kane was the problem 😂
If spurs can add two or three quality players to their squad in the next transfer window , they gotta be considered as title contenders ! Over the last three seasons , noone ithe EPL has been more consistent than Son . Hed be an asset to any team !
Very loose goal both TBH
coys 🤍
madisson is on fire
Tottenham are flying
This commentator is such a vibe whenever Tottenham score😂😂😂
No doubt, Son is universe class.
Son is father of fulham
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
패스는 못줄망정 소니가 받은공을 지공이라고 뺏어서 냅다 차버리고 화내는 모습에 진짜 어이가 없더라. 쓰레기 인성 소유자 본색 드러내는거에  소니가 얼마나 황당해하고  기분 상했는지.. 그럼에도 소니는 자기탓으로 돌리는 인터뷰까지 했는데 메디슨 이 악동은  인터뷰에서도 소니가 지를 막아선거라고 끝까지 지 본성을 드러냈다. 부주장 자격도 없고 벤치나 가라. 너말고 로셀소가 더 잘하더라!
메디슨이 소니한테 점점 대들기 시작했고 소니골과 스포트라이트를 뺏어가려한다.
모든 선수가 잘하고 있지만 비카리오와 미키는 매경기 놀랍다❤
what a captain .. he can finished it alone .. but his assist will give good impact for another game to their team. go spurs!!
Furaham goalkeeper is useless. I’m glad he left arsenal. Both two goals were his mistake
Son is epl best player and striker
but mitoma is faster
이기적인 메디슨에 의해 곧 팀이 분열될 듯??? 그래서 언제나 그랬듯 토트넘의 자리로 되돌아 갈 듯???
Put English subtitles please
Son & MaddiSON
두번째 골도 손흥민은 충분히 오른발로 감아찰 수 있기에.. 매디슨에게 찔러주는 공에대한 수비가 불가능했음ㄷㄷ
판타스틱 골~~쏘니^^
fantastic shooting and assistance
조으다!
Ange has now earned the most points in 9 games then any other manager in the history of the Prem. Amazing manager COYS
Son does son, Maddy is mad!!
They must win something this season with this superb form that they are, they have been in an impressive form to crown their efforts, they have to win a 🏆
Richarson
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Maddison 🤝 Son
Son légend
Son🎉🎉
Love Tottenham from Syria , Free for Palasteen
Sprinting distance when pressing in this season Rank no.1 : Sonny(1,314m) Clinical shooting, hard pressing, Pac The best striker
Sonaldo
We all know we miss the Duo of Kane and Son but after Maddison's arrival, it's not so bad, Top of the cold standings 🥶
이번시즌 손흥민 득점왕하고 토트넘 우승할것이다!  이글은 성지가 될것이다!
HEUNG MIN SON, RICHARLISSON , MADDISON are G.O.A.T , the SPURS are actually the BEST TEAM OF THE WORLD, what else, hi hi !!!!
Its good to see both Tottenham and Harry kane are doing well
Imagine being the defender that caused your team to concede two goals "That's perfection" - Harry Maguire
Said at the start of the season though James maddison would be a good bye
For a player that doesn't currently train with the squad, Son is like Ledley King who also skipped practice before matches due to a persistent injury. If the team can keep this up, perhaps they can challenge for the title?
❤
SONALDO
Great team effort.  COYS!  All the Way!!
Brilliant from Sonny and Madders and Vicario for his two vital saves....But I wonder if Richy or PEH will be given the credit and recognition they deserve for the perfectly weighted passes that lead to their goals respectively? Sadly I doubt it.   Or even Emerson for that shot block? Great result for us though..good team performance. COYS.
Son world class.... Maddison world class.... Richy world class.... Vicario world class..... Ange legend.... Loving this team 🔥. COYS🤍
Let's show some respect on PEH. That first time pass into Son which allowed him to slide it into Madders was first class. I personally hope he doesn't leave in Jan as I believe there is another layer to his game which Postegoglou can develop which he was never allowed to reveal under the previous 3 managers. He has a great shot on him, incredible stamina and is as reliable as a rock, which is exactly what we'll need going forward.
Son is back 🐐💀
richardson need to be back.
61 was our last time so here's hoping
While yoi,'re getting off on a simple win, I think ange complained about the 2nd half, but he pit Skippy on, who has just about the level of a Championship player. He also signed Brennan and put Dier on the bench, they will never be champions. My hat off to Paratici who signed many of these players, udogie, bissouma. Vicario, sarr. So I also cannot see anyone replace Paratici which tells me, this is not great.
You give Son the title of captain and the team is taken up a few levels...it's exciting football.  Really impressive turnaround this year...let's see them build on this
Nice job from Ange
I used to be a Spurs fan...but still disgusted at how awful so many fans treated Son when he went through that slump.  Personally, I don't think the Spurs deserve Son...still think he should go to a team with a more loyal fanbase... way too many flakes in Tottenham
Have to admit, Son and Maddison are pretty fun to watch.  Son involved in both goals shows how integral he is to the fabric of this team
Son pride of Asia
It's the best Four: Son, Richarlison, Kulusevski and Meddison. It's the best combination, it's a victory
Big up sonny the South Korean north London hack attacker

Ohh Yess who else is feeling.... "definitely we the Spurs are gonna win that league title and Chew every club which dares come in our road to success "thumbs up 👍
빛(light)카리오
Mady is a good addition to the squad. Son and maddy a beast to watch.
Vicario deserves a cal up for italy.
Jame s MADDISON on his prime😮
How can it be a first goal for Maddie ?
손흥민선수 골 넣는장면 수십번 돌려봤습니다 정확히 원하는 지점으로 골을 찔러 넣는 킬러가 따로없네요
Son is the best Asian soccer player in history. And one of the top soccer players in history.
Ange ball is crazy
Imagine if Spurs win the prem and bayern lose the bundesliga 😲
Sonny and Maddison the best duo 🤍
Korean from outer space
As a Chelsea fan I hope Tottenham go all the way this time.great bust of confidence and elite mentality from this team
outstanding but expected ❤‍🔥
congrats to Tottenham 2 goals score by pressing high in pitch congrats to ange for great football ,vicario,romero,vanben,maddison son all are world class players
We know they not winning the league . Master bottlers
Richarlison is the new Soldado.
Vicario MOTM
I can not wait for Newcastle vs Tottenham. Both are attacking and hard-pressing. Should be an intense watch.
Is Kulu scared of scoring? Why passing clear chances on goal?  Let's thank Vicario, he saved us.  Son, Maddison...lovely.  That man called VDV, he gives me joy, with his combination with Romero.  I still noticed Biss's absence a little, but good job from Hojbjerg.   Everyone performed excellent. Ange is the GOAT!  #COYS
ngl I am LOVING this new Maddi Son combo!! They gel so well together!
손흥민 최고
Even though we're off to a great start without him, I don't think the club or its supporters should ever forget Henry Blaine and what he did for us!
Yes Son and Maddison got some nice combo, but look at our defenders including Vicario. They've been amazing.
LOL why is it sped up? from official TH channel, should be better than this surely.
It will not last hahaha
Maddison Should go to Chelsea 😢😢😢
Finally, Spurs is One team
Sehr gut
I can’t imagine the game without Vic. He is so amazing keeper. I really love him! He is one of BEST contributor for Spurs!
Incredible! Son is world class!
same mistake twice by the same defender
These new signings have been excellent.
Vic-carry-o !
토트넘 우승 가즈아
When we signed vicario I was kinda doubtful in fact disappointed but he’s put me in my place 😂 WORLD CLASS KEEPER !
It really shows that song is a world class. Good ridance we sold Kane. Well done spurs looks like the titile is coming to white hart lane 😂
Trio Son, Rocharlison, Heung Min Son, Maddison
Son should have won multiple trophies if he was in different team.
Kipernya bagus, kiper asal italia 👍
MaddiSon combo is crazy!!!
Son is  unbelievable!
흥민이 이하   ㅡㅡㅡㅡ니혼 미만잡 ㅋㅋ 질투심 폭발
Damn😮
다음 경기엔 히샬리송도 한골 넣자.ㅎ
흠 비카리오가 잘 막네. 잘 데려왔네.ㅎ
After harry kane left son is being noticed❤❤
주급 인상해라 흥민이가 해주는것에 비해 주급이 짜다 빡빡아
ayam sayur membuktikan taji nya
p.sarr lové
Frankly I don't know why everybody is trying to play the same kind of football by playing from the back really. What happened to the Sam Alladyce style of football.
Frame of video is dropped. Please check video edit
Can Spurs win this cup??I love the way they play nowadays
Hebat ya orang asia pertama jadi kapten di club elite Inggris,class
👍
Tottenham memang luarbiasa...  Tapi team ini juga selalu dan sering mendapatkan voucher dari kepemimpinan wasit yg menguntungkan mereka. Seperti melawan united / liverpool
The club that has never won any major trophy thinks it is a big club. You sit on the table thanks to "significant human error" and the five referees that helped you cheat Liverpool
Son is my favorite  player 🎉
우리 토트넘 파이팅 ㅎ ㅎ
One indentity Mark for son is his goals  I think for him it's an abomination to score simple goals and finishes  Love this new Tottenham. Under Son captaincy it's bound to make history in a long time atleast
SON !!
very bad defender
진짜 빛카리오!!!
Please see me https://youtube.com/shorts/PgwQT0iM24I?si=JVmr1JJcRv88DfMR
This is the same Fulham as a team Arsenal draw with a lucky 2 Vs 2 earlier to the league. If we must excel or win the 2023/2024 EPL league. As a team we should start taking advantage of the smaller clubs. Even if I understood that there's no smaller clubs in the premier League anymore. But, we should always try our best to beat them. And I will also orgue our team AFC to always prepared for the second rounds of the game this season and correct thier mistakes with those clubs they lose points with and with God on our side we could grabbed the league trophy and once became unbeatable again. I commend all the players of AFC and those on the bench for doing a great job. But, we could do more as a united, dedicated team.❤
Son & Maddison, the remarkable duo.
주모~~~~캬
Come on spurs. Build Son a statue he deserves
0:50 he knows son scores before he take a shot
<3!
Even though bissouma didn't play, hojbjerg came in and put in a great performance COYS ! 🖤🤍🖤🤍
What a goal by Son 😊😊😊😊😊
말로만 하는건 아무런 설득력이 없음 손흥민은 말뿐만 아니라 실력으로도 모두가 고개를 끄덕일 모습을 보여주고 있음  오히려 주장을 맡은 게 더 큰 원동력이 되었을지도
Son Pride of Asia ❤
팀 분위기 너무 좋다~ 진짜 보는데 뭉클하네
INDONESIA HADIR  BAGUS BANGET
Great result but still getting there.Sorry Skipp still not for me looked a bit lost when came on  Just had not got that spark we need for Prem
son really started to have his shine now since kane left
ever since harry kane left they have been on form he must have been the curse
by May next year Spurs will drop to 6th or 7th of the table
It's new ❤😊❤😊
올해 우승한번 가자!!!!!!
Son
0:50 Faked by Son's motion, those 2 defenders bumping against each other. So hilarious. Fooled so bad!
SON>>>>Kane. Kane is just penalty box player.
hojbjerg is so underrated, both goals started from him
Cuti-Micky duo is top
Son and mad son😂
Top of the table
Vicario is the best GP in the league
They could show replays of the goals.
Vicario❤❤
Ange's vision is beginning to gel.  With game after game Ange is proving that he is getting to grips with the Premier League👌
THANKS VICARIO FOR CLEAN CHEET I HAVE BEDRO PORRO IN FANTASY PL 😍😅
https://youtu.be/1MCUYUMe6VA?si=x8knujNQ19iqVTrL
Dier and Hugo always shouted at Son for no reason. Maddison is also doing this shit to Son agian. Just stop doing that shit.
손흥민은 월클이다. 토트넘 멱살 케리로 1위 지킨다. 우승 가능한 구단으로 이적이 아닌 내가 내팀을 우승 시켜 버리겠다는 진심이 팀을 끌어 올리는 것으로 월클을 증명하고 있다.
손흥민과 메디슨 정말 최고네요 멋진경기 잘봤어요
Every player did a good job from defence to offence. Fantastic!
If son doesnt move and stand still. It means the player he is staring at is gonna score. Like lee kangin did
son don’t deserve 87 ovr they should fix it
*Maddi*SON*❤❤❤
Didn't the same defender give the ball away for both goals ?
Lovely win Spurs! Maddison and Son in me prem fantasy team going great guns ;)
Sonny❤
tottenham Emblem is blue bird

Man I wish I was rich enough to buy my self a ticket to London and watch Spurs Live. I'm the cursed one in this capitalism.
no matter how great Tottenham is they will never get a trophy.😂
😊
National Emergency!!!! We need another player like Son!!!! For the next generation.
빛카리오 진짜 빛쳤다
Two goals given away. passing from the back
Outstanding!!!
The way Son slides after the goal is sooo cool~ ⚽️ It's like a movie.
Son dan Madison luar biasa kipper nya juga sangat bagus
Is it just me or are all highlights videos glitchy

so good for Tottenham
richarliSON SON hyeung min  madisSON   THE SONS OF ANARCHY!  ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Kane leaving was the best thing to happen for the team, they now play as one unlike relying on one person
another sonny day!
hojbjerg seems detach from the club
Richards ❤
Vicario!!!!!!!!!!
Everyone is thinking Tottenham is in best form and might win but Tottenham have this type of start in every season and then they start to loose after 12-15 matches.
Every player ounstanding. COYS
And Fifa Still rates Son 88
Bassley can play by Ajax…. Whoh… So bad
As an Asian and seeing Son becoming a world class player makes me proud to be Asian.
두 번째 골...손이랑 메디슨 한참 포옹하는데 왜 이렇게 찡하냐 ㅠㅠ
nice win and sends us back top sonny and maddison are great together happy coys
두 골 모두 전방 압박 속에서 나왔다는게 너무 멋있다
It honestly insane how much Son has stepped up as both a captain and main goal contributor
It's his moment. Yes it is ~!
What a win!! Totally enjoy every moment of being a Spurs Fan!
From a city fan,  i hope spurs can keep this form and win a trophy at least 👍
As a Liverpool fan you guys better win fucking something
Spurs are cooking, epl this season will be something else❤❤
Kane was the problem from head to toe.for both totenham and england
outstanding!
postecoglu made this performence coz make a clean of team’s mafia group.
spurs just need a player who can atleast be better in mid field but they got one who do support the team in every way (maddison) in search of a silver they found a rare diamond
Marblous yet expected Sonny.
Every top 6 team needs a son.
Mdison dueo
sonny asian proud loveu
Rashford should take notes from Son and Bruno should learn Maddison.
sonny 😊😊😊😊
Tottenham  Hotspur  vs Hotspur 2- 0 Fulham -Premier  League *

흥민이형 지렸다
Just problem was a Kane.
Great pressure, outstanding performance.
what's wrong with the defender number 3?
이대로만가서 우승해보자
The quality of this video is so bad
So happy to see Maddisson get his first goal at home
Legend season.
Congrats, my favorite English club, Tottenham Hotspur........
Vicario ❤❤❤
The Yido's on Talksport this morn',  on about winning the league?? You only beat Fulham, at home and so you should!! Comical!! 😂 YNWA!!
sonaldo
Taking time out to appreciate Udogie Destiny 👏🏽👏🏽 What a baller! 20 years old and an absolute beast of a wingback
Always spur..
Romero underated  CB. .
Funny how everyone knew that would be a goal even before Son take the shoot
Son quá hay
빛카리오❤=shining cario
Sonny😻
What an unselfish play from Son and finish by Maddison, Love the team play~!!
Madison and Son combination, the new Kane and Son combination.
Credit to Richy his first half was fantastic! So much energy, closed down the ball a heap of times and made some great passes. Second half went a little more quiet and lacked enthusiasm but definitely a big improvement.
nice sonny!
Son 🔥
Mané>son
Salah>son

2 gol yg sama dari presing tingggi spurs
Sonny is the king ❤
Son really has that finesse shot play style 😂.
son  the proud asian
ㅇ
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Falling in love with this team.. I think i should get a team jersey 😢
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ sony!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Son is so clinical. Once he has the space to shoot, you know it's a goal
HOPE THEY MAINTAIN THIS LEVEL
Sony is perfect captin ❤
I love to take the win and all but for the second goal, i dont quite understand, isnt Sonny offside before passing the ball to Madders?
Harry Kane was a curse for tot
Tottenham play for the title !!!
son!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Aye man im a united fan but i cant lie, seeing tottenham succeed makes me happy. id much rather spurs win the league over arsenal city or liverpool
I came for the dart celly and was disappointed
MadiSON
To quote somebody’s else’s quote :  Arrest  conte immediately “ lol 😂
쏘니  2골  예상 했는데~~~1골  ㅎㅎㅎ~~~그래도  잘했다  소니     화이팅~~
Vipcario~~~~~~~~~~~!!
now, what kind of bs those haters are gonna say about the captain of the 1st team in pl? surprise me. 😅
메디슨, 비카리오, 우도기, 판더벤 영입은 진짜 미쳤다...이 영상에선 없는데 후반전 추가 시간 마지막에 수비라인 다 무너졌을때 판더벤이 미친속도로 1대1 마크하던데 진짜 괴물
ARSNAL❤
Incredible sonny
Let him cook.
Why do these spurs lads feel the need to  celebrate a goal like like adolescent school boys. They've been at it since the Delle Ali days, it just looks pathetic and childish. Be men not kids on the playround!!
우승 가즈아—-🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
How this Tottenham presses up, wonderful...
Son, Ricarlison and Madisson..
0:50 Golazo de Sonny ❤❤❤
Two amazing assists from Calvin Bassey yet again! Best defender in the world.
나이스 쏘니♡♡♡♡♡
Ange is definitely a great manager, look how he has bonded with the players. made sure they are happy and is getting the best out of the team,  That's management. I'm sure Harry potter will be feeling like Oh I should have stayed.
I don't get why goalkeepers always feel the need to fall to the ground even after making a save when standing up. That said, Son goal of the season.
Son the best
A great keeper can bring so much change
그의 아버지만 부인하고 그 밖의 온 지구인들이 인정하는 말. ''SON is World Class.''
Wow good team, GK ❤
MOTM Vicario convince me otherwise
Son is super class player ❤
토트넘의 공격적인 스타일 너무 좋아요. 상대팀 진영에서 쏘니과 메디슨의 압박으로 골을 넣는 과정도 너무 멋집니다. 손흥민선수의 상대 수비수를 넋놓게하는 슈팅 짜릿하네요. 비카리오와 로메로가 선방해줘서 골 안 내줘서 다행이예요. 더욱 발전하는 토트넘 응원합니다~~
Y not repeat highlight goals
I can watch this all day long
So its maddison who scored both goals. 1 maddi n 2 son
Golnya jatuh dari langit semua
❤❤❤❤ MERCI ÉQUIPE ❤❤❤❤
Son madrid
I know how great Kane is to both Spurs and England, but as a Gunner I always jealous Son

Romero best defender in the world rightnow!
I hope spurs win a premier league this season

Jika penampilan apik ini bisa bertahan sampai akhir musim, akan menjadi sejarah baru di EPL
Van de ven madderson and son and Romero are The best Spurs players yet this season😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
wow!! Son Great!! Last goal can his own goal. but he passed !!
Vicario will be immense for Spurs if they are gonna acheive anything this season
Vicario 비카리오 빛카리오~
He’s in my head~in my head Sonny sonny sonny~ny~ny
Say "thanks" to Simon Hooper and corrupt VAR for 3 points against Liverpool) Tottenshit) Hello from Russia!
Fast forward to December and they are in 10th😂
🍑🔥🍑🔥
Son is HIM
Both goals came from Fulham mistakes
Go head Spurs
Son ❤
Sonny MOTM
Skipp looked slow and a bit overweight as well. Needs to step up.
Legend Sonny
as a liverpool fan That 3 points of the top of the table is ours
Sorry but why is Son still at Totenham? Real Madrid & Barcelona where are you? Lol
Keep your consistency

Vicario OMG🔥🔥🔥
2 same mistake from the same player lol i hope spurs win the league
I love this team 👇
모든 구역에서 양발로 정확하게 감아차는 능력은 메시와 호날두도 할수 없습니다🔥🔥🔥
Vicario my boy is insane
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0PvM0MT4Lo
Totenham gameplay so much like Mancity.Their game has improved alot
Fulham, what shit was that
Spurs have mastered the art of pressing 👌🏾
son and maddison might be the greatest duo in the world rn
I was at the game and that one handed save from Vicario was outstanding. I literally saw that flying in until his big left hand blocked it! Superb reactions and strength
역시 손흥민❤
سون هو مفتاح المبارة
와...비카리오 미쳤다...
Loved when Maddison was hugging son than huddled everyone together. That’s brotherhood right there ✊🏾
Postegecolu = most points of any PL manager in their first 9 games (23) Son = on fire Maddison = exceptional Bissouma = unleashed Sarr = relentless Romero = gone to the next level Van de Ven = all round ability with exceptional pace for his size Porro = getting better all the time Udogie = great everywhere and excellent ball carrier Vicario = best save percentage in the PL (79%+)  Also, IMO, Brennan Johnson = Gareth Bale like potential   And this team is only going to get better this season as Postecoglu’s tactics bed in and the players become more comfortable with his systems and training.
Woaaahhhh😮
Mr. Sonshine ..
I’ve been saying this since the ucl final. Kane drains the life out of Tottenham and Son rejuvenates it 😌
'Out standing!'
Son is Coys Legend already, we must give him number 7 forever
Son and madison no Madisonny ok
Because the British are not racist, they should erect a statue of son in front of the stadium.
올해는 우승하자!!
This spurs side looks good enough to compete for the league 🤞🏾
son is the best of spurs
Son the Bomb!
Son is the best
손흥민이 대단하긴 하구나..
Son is world class....Very consistent.
That pass from Pierre to Son for the second goal was sublime.
비카리오는 진짜 짐승이네요😂
Pace of VDV🙌⚡
I actually think that with a little bit of luck Tottenham could win the league this year. They are playing very nice and entertaining football 😊
Oh no we don't get to see the throwing dart celebration :(
i don’t know which one is more confusing: Seeing Tottenham at the top of table or seeing Tottenham far more lethal with Son as Capt than with Harry Kane
Vicario is insane
best player goaly~ what the all the best Tottenham and supporters too.!!!!
We played well,but e have to take more chances
손흥민 메디슨뿐만 아니라  나머지 선수들도 이번시즌 너무 잘하고 있음
unbelievable son
Richy just needs to add goals to his performances in order to get the praise he deserve
Tottenham is playing some scary football 🫣
Please win the league so harry kane suffers😂
Ps Richarleson was pony , welcome back Johnson.....
Son's assist was pretty slick, Maddison was in space but Son sees how the defender probably closes the gap, so he holds it long enough, flat foots him and even if there was less space he knew there was enough time ⏲️ and angle. What a player. Richy also made some nice passes today. Hes great in the last third with space, positioning and short passes. Its  something which is harder to notice but he gets the ball at these angles which open it up for furtber passes. Thats one of those unteachable talents.
흥민 매더슨 조합은 흥민 케인 조합보다 더 손발이 잘 맞음!!! 멋지다
Son
A lot of unnecessary errors last night , 2 decent finishes . Madison needs to drop the Billy big bolox and play it simple sometimes. Van Der ven man of the match , awesome performance..... COYS
Vicario is insane 🤯🤯🤯
I am impressed with Madison.
Hojbjerg intercept made the second goal.  I'm glad we won, but we are going to have to tighten up against the big boys.
One day coach justin said that Son is mediocre striker, now I know that coach justin is mediocre commentator 😢
GODcario
Nobody is talkign bout Vicario
What a coach and what a team!!
Оба гола - результат прессинга.
Two mistakes two goals. Clinical
Spurs on top of the table is like an elephant on top of a tree. You don't know how it got there, but it's bound to fall off.
Жоғары пресинг 👍

Should have more goals. We have got to finish teams off . And the keeper was outstanding. And we as a team we looked as one in perfect harmony COYS

Good overall performances from the lads. COYS UP THE SPURS!
Great performance, incredible atmosphere - COYS!
Tottenham fc top the epl from india,kerala
Fullham defender Bassey help Tottenham attacker.....😂
Everyone's second-favourite team. Well done Spurs.
토트넘이 우승하기 위해서 선수들이 배워야 할 것은 쏘니의 축구기술이 아니라 쏘니의 이타적인 플레이 방식이다.
I support a very hot spur😂
My 3 son play for Spure😊😊
Don't tell me Bassey gave away the 2 goals😢😢😢
Vicario is so underrated. Watched him since his Empoli days. Absolute beast
All your goals came from Fulham mistake. What if there were no mistakes the game would have ended nil nil. Create chances and score. If not then your just a luck team and luck will end
Pain went straight to Harry Kane
Sonny be givin goosebumps
Sprinting towards the keeper, pressing the defenders into mistakes led to both goals. That's Postecoglou tactics at their best. He is a breath of fresh air to the league. No defence is safe against this team when they have this aggression and desire. Great to watch this team.
vivario
vicario was a beastttt
저 아름다운 슛을 보라 대한민국 주장 토트넘 주장 너무나도 자랑스럽고 대견한 손흥민 덕분에 행복하다 토트넘 전설을 경배합니다 손흥민 항상 열렬히 응원합니다!! 쏘니 화이팅!!
그냥  토트넘 떠나자 메디슨 시발것 아시아인이라고 손 무시하는거 봐라 리버풀 클롭한태 가자
That vicarious save is insane 🔥
Fulham good team 2 mistake from goal keeper and defender cost Fulham 3 point
Vicario should be number 1 choice for national team Italy , Donnaruma go away
Imagine if they actually win the premier League right after Harry kane left
lovin the team's chemistry this season with captain Son. keep it up boys, let's make history!
로메로와 판더팬을 빼놓고 오늘의 승리를 설명할 순 없다
이것은 나의 eafc24 게임영상을 보는것 같다.😁😁😁
Tottenham Great
Spurs makes me happy!! They'll lift the trophy.
Italian super guy saved 2 goals
Maddison having the time of his life❤
Defensive errors
AS a totham suporte sins 1961 win or lose.this team is the best.
Only 2 minutes of highlights?
Kochi will be so proud with Son 😅
One thing about sonny, he don't miss chances
Son the best
Udogie was a real beast again
I am the gooners but very resfect to the lily white especially to Son... 🎉🎉🎉🎉
빛카리오도 지리네 진짜ㅋㅋㅋ
Son, what an outstanding player!!
The end is nigh, it's the only rational explanation.
Chicken stupid club,, 😂😂 referee fc
a very good team to watch. Spurs of this season is absolutely amazing.
Son is like
Strong
😂Spurs can press
No doubt. Madders is world class
In my head sonny sonny
올시즌 손흥민 골든부츠 한번 더 노려보자 패널트킥 흥민에게 주라~
С победой Тоттенхэма! Рад, что Сон забивает почти в каждом матче.  Ура 🙌!
손흥민도 잘했지만 비카리오 개지리네
와 ㅋㅋㅋ 쩐다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
손군은 한국 유니폼을 입으면 힘이 빠진다 디자인 개선이 필요
Son did Son again
Enjoy it while it lasts, reality will hit them spurs soon enough 😂
watch Sonny right now. he is turned to a real Beast, he breaks the shadow of Kane.. he feels free to improved his ability and skill in the game.. a real top class player.. 🔝
the fact that Son has been a very clutch performer since 2015 for us isn't talked about enough. 10+ years of peak football greatness. I know my GOAT, I know my skipper... a true sensation .
케인이 없어도 토트넘은 잘 돌아 가는구나??
sonny could score 3 goals. he took one, gave another to madder and lost the other for madder's greedy play. but sonny said it's his fault. that's sonny who is leading the team on the top.
Son is unbelievable!
케인을 좋아하지만 이쯤되면 잘 나가준거 같은 기분이 드는것 나뿐일까?
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Viccario master
Both the first and second goals were created through forward pressure. Sonny ranks first in sprint distance in the league. I am very happy that Tottenham is first in the league. All players are doing their roles excellently. I♥Sonny~‼
sonny's humble attitude is the role model of a team captain. we are so proud of you!
My goodness that save was bananas
L
Look how Son pressing the opponent, brilliant
Congrats Guys! I am a City fan from Nigeria.
That press from Spurs is really aggressive. I've only seen City press lile that.
매디슨 센스 좋네..  손흥민에게 주고 달려들어오면서 오프사이드 걸릴것 같으니 순간 방향 바꾼후 다시 들어가는거 봐라..
메디슨은 신입생인데 경기중에 고참선수고  캡틴에게 저렇게 화를 낸다고???  팀 분위기를 망칠 선수임. 팀이 어려울때 저런애들 때문에 팀이 망가지죠.
dan levy is not resigning son??? he is waiting to see if he will sell or keep son! levy has no respect for son, even though he has done so much for the team....its way overdue,, sons getting chumpchange for what he brings to the team...am i wrong or am i right????
Madrid nya EPL ini mahh... Rapi bgt pressing nyaaa. Ngeriiii. Pelatih baru mereka luarbiasa
I don’t care what anyone says we can’t win without Kulu
Vicariooooooo!!! What an absolute bargain and glad to see Hojbjerg play again
Trophyless fc cheating all their way to the top of the table
Kane leaves, spurs go top😂
is caine still with the team?
If Son was in Real Madrid squad last three years he would be Balloon D'or winner
MaddiSon 🤍💙 COYS
We all wanna see celebration at the stadium 😁😁
Son is the best
Vicario is a huge upgrade from lloris. Undoubtedly. Looks very composed and Compact 🤍
Sonny 1assist 1goal 👍
The team atmosphere seems to have gotten even better after Sonny took over as captain.
Ange COOKING
I’m gonna put it out there, I think Ricky was a beast today. His pressing, hold up, tackling and chasing told all over the park was outstanding. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Son runs like cristiano Ronaldo, I love you spurs
Vicario is fantastic!
Vicario come to Manchester pleawseee
A great player Son ❤❤but unfortunately underrated 😢😢
Fixed game 😂
리그 우승하자
what a team!❤
Man, no one is talking about how well Richarlison played. Give my bro some credit. He got the assist with son and he had some good chances. No one is seeing that he is becoming better.
People should know all two goals began from Son's pressure to Leno.
kane was the problem at spurs
I can see why the boss was angry after the game. We became casual in the last quarter of the game. A little bit arrogant actually. I see that seeping in as we continue to gain plaudits, and the players start allowing it to go to their heads. Maddison needs to be free, but he's at risk of causing issues by getting in around Son when he shouldn't. He even took a bit of a dig at Son in his post match interview for getting in his way for a potential 3rd. Gaffer needs to knock them down a peg in the coming weeks.
Sonaldo is back 🥵💪
High pressing produces opponent’s mistakes and we capitalize on them with absolute efficiency. This is becoming a habit of ours, meaning we’re keep progressing into Angie ball.
SONNY NEXT LEVEL❤
What is Calvin Bassey doing????
The attacking pace from Spurs. the pressure to Fulham. well played Spurs
ㅋㅋㅋ와..ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋㅋ...
GUD JOB SON
Spurs are looking good! 👊🏼
요리스 다이어 페르시치빠지니깐 토토넘 진짜강해졌다 그동안요3명은 토토넘에 민폐선수엿던가. ...역시..빛카리오는 진짜 앞으루 쭉 부상없으면 계속출전할듯....
I wish Tottenham can wim the league though not easy

손흥민 멋지다!!
0:50 son vs 5 defenders 👏
무패행진 미쳤다 COYS
Now that kane is gone I actually like watching spurs
Man seeing this young talented team makes me feel confident about our future
Nice assist Richallison
both goals was own goals
SON and MAD SON  🔥🔥
Vicario 🔥🔥
What a goal from sony
Son had a 90% chance of scoring, but gave up a goal to Maddison for a 100% chance.
무패 그만하고 이제 패배 좀 가져오자. 패배가 없으니까 어색하네 다음 크리스탈 팰리스에선 패배하자!
Two errors? 😵‍💫
Everyone will rave on about Madison and Son (and rightly so!), but it isn't about how well you play. It's about taking your opportunities.   Fulham had two great chances to score and were it not for two incredible saves, that scoreline might look very different!   Vicario is top draw! 👌
Son and Madison are so sharp right now.
Nobody will ever convince me about the efficacy of this insane idea of playing from the back. It is beyond ridiculous!
1:38 안는게 그냥 안는게 아닌데 브로맨스 ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ
bodoh son
Without Vicario it was 2:2
Watch this Boy loves football so much please https://youtu.be/pTp-IBth0-Y?si=YOb4vxeXLScOgHKP
이번시즌 포백이랑 골키퍼 진짜 미쳤다
Win the league for Kane.
Son hiung min pantas menjadi seorang kapten atau pemimpin ... Terasa hangat dan damai ... Semua pemain menghormatinya dan menyayangi nya ... Team tambah kompak dan tidak egois ... Bisa-bisa juara EPL Tottenham jika selalu hangat seperti ini ...😊😊
Madison's line breaking is amazing!!
ayam sayur❤
are you telling me these guys are about to win the premier league, it going to be interesting
As an Arsenal this far the best Spurs side . Very well organised. Well played and congrats.
Win the league for Kane 😂
메디슨의 탐욕이 조금 걱정스러운 부분입니다...
Postecoglu really needs to make Tottenham a Goal Scoring Machine, bc what if Son gets injured one day?
Vicario가 MOM 이죠!
poor Calvin bassey😢
I already said and I will say again,that guy Calvin Bassey is a total blunder
Son is an absolute genius of the sport!! For once, Tottenham are serious tittle contenders this season!
What a team
Coyld have wasuly been 2-2 if vicario wasnt such a BEAST!!!!  Great game lads #coys
Son has been great and is the reason why Spurs won this game although NOT convincingly. As soon as Son gets subbed off, you can feel Fulham's confidence getting pumped. This is absolutely NOT a coincidence. Fulham knew there's no more Son to threaten them on the counter, they throw away their bus and were ALL IN to get at least a draw. The bench is still too weak and Ange had ALOT to do in the January transfer window.
That knee slide is so iconic.
Spur for champion this year...son the legend
Guys, i’m a Roma fan from italy, but i love watching premier league, and you’re always been my favorite team, i love you so much, i wish you the best for this season🤍🤍 Angeball is so fun to watch💪
❤Son❤💪
And yes its a SONI moment
누가 손흥민 월클 아니래? 월클 맞잖아
Yo who made the song at the end?
Son is best
hey !!  Madison!!  Don't be too fussy and just play soccer.  Should have let Son shoot.  Why did you even try to shoot?    Don't overdo it! Madison!! You are not on the same level as Son.   Never think that just because you are British you are above or on the same level as Son.   Because you keep thinking like that, you act presumptuously at the stadium.
son's brutally scathing goal
KANE WAS THE PROBLEM ALL ALONG
Vicario had some crazy saves 🔥🔥🔥
Vicario is outstanding
Nice play
메디슨 골넣고 손흥민 가르키고 무릎 슬라이딩...소름 돋는다...골 넣고 어시스트해준 선수에 대한 존경...
Hoiberg class
Стоило Кейна уйти, как Тотемхем оказался на чемпионской тропе, желаю Вам победы в АПЛ
Son ❤
Never rated Maddison.... How wrong was I ??  Man of the match could have been any of 6 in that game, well done Spurs. Postecoglu will win you something within 2yrs.
I don't know who made the call to sign Vicario but give him a raise big time!
No disrespect kane keep scoring goals cause Son is too good
who need kane? striker slow speed
Semua akan son pada waktunya 😂
COYS.........What a Team work Vicario, Maddison and Son. Back on Table
손흥민은 절대 월클이 아닙니다.
No disrespect, but are they really better after Kane left?
MaddiSON, RicharliSON!! SON. Trio😊
Защитник 2 раза обрезал, седня плохо спал он наверное
Højbjerg is fantastic
One shot One kill, Sonny! COYS!!
Why we bought Mount & not Maddison will always scratch at my soul
Vicario for Victory.
COYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🤍💙🤍💜
Teteham juara EPL ngimpi kali
The incredible Son😎😎
SON SON SON !!!... heung-min-son, maddi-son, richarli-son, emer-son,brendan john-son 😂😂 Tottenham Hot-SON😊
Vicario is huge for Spurs. Absolutely fantastic
Son❤
Jesus, in the past seasons if we used Kane Sonny 2 top??
Son is world Class and at his best form at the moment 🔥🔥
I am loving this season :)
비카리오 진짜 잘하네 ㅋㅋㅋ 토트넘 올시즌 우승먹어보장
두 골 다 전방압박으로 나왔네... 예전 토트넘과 가장 달라진 점은 역시 전방압박인 듯.
Vica!!
harry who?
Beautiful football.
호이베르 굿 👍
쏘니,, 리그 우승하자~

비카리오가 2골 막았네
Nice keeping,nice defence, nice played what a game hope the team will win the league
2 Assist by GK 🔥
Good capitain
Not to forget we are playing without Bissouma and Bentencur atm 😊
Maddi-Son is Hot🔥
Greg Secker can S my D! Are you with me?
포스테코글루 감독은 안중요해? 그가 없었으면 이 모든게 불가능하다는거 알지?
Son 🔥🔥🔥
When I saw the goal scene, all the goals were made because of good pressure, and I realized that pressure is really important
I don’t get why Son isn’t bigger right now
Hey guys, can i believe some arguments on this game between Son and Mad are just temporary stuff? just like Son and Hugo before?
Please post defensive tackles too. Our back 4 was amazing. Running down to stop the counter.
It used to be Kane & Son... Now I think it's Son & Maddison 😊👏 👏 👏
Crazy game from Son,Maddison and Vicario
Vicario...
You can see different triggers which initiate the press leading to goals. It is brilliant.
I don't get it. Why do team insist on playing out from the back when Fulham lost 2-0 by doing just that. It seems such a stupid way to play football if your team is not good enough to do it.
What is Harry kane thinking right now?
I don't care what anyone says. Spurs are still shit and will be found out
I really want spurs to win atleast the fa cup this season
Son, he deserves to stand alongside spurs legends, underated world-class 👏
Vicario deserves more compliments
ngl, it was shaky after Son, Madders & Udogie went off. Thank goodness Vicario & Cuti stayed calm and defended well.
Vicario 🔥🔥
Son and Maddiaon dangerous duo
❤ from ISRAEL
Both goalkeepers are🔥
Tototo yakapedza masports
Don't worry spursys, your wheels will fall right off as usual soon.
nice one sony!
Sonny goal ❤
Son x Maddison were amazing last night 🤯
South Melbourne Hellas.
Son sooo LETHAL
Son should come to Liverpool ~Klopp will make him win Ballon d’or ~
무엇보다 조직력이 탄탄해 진 것이 너무 보기 좋습니다. 서로 격려하는 모습!! 토트넘 멋집니다.!!!
Living vicariously through Vicario!!!!!
Why is nothing a Big Football club which is interested to propose Son. Honestly, He's just incredible.
Nothing for Son to score is easy goal . Most of goals are arts.
No kane no problem.
thank Brobbey
Super sonny
maybe they dodged a bullet with raya :(
I want to ask british fans as one of koreans. Do u think son is the GOAT among all Asian football players?
키퍼 개잘하네
Madison heung min
RicharliSON assist SON to scored and MaddiSON scored assist by SON
What a game
와 비카리오 ㅈ되네;; 진짜 잘 샀다
The press is crazy!!
공 앞으로 돌진하는 모든 선수의 열정이 오늘의 승리의 밑거름인듯  내 눈엔 우도기가 가장 멋져보였다
Nothing but injuries can stop Sonny and his teammates.  Spurs' lads are seamlessly united,  so they are getting closer to winning the championship from day to day. Newcomers like Micky, Vicario, Udogie, and Madders are in good shape, not to mention Sonny.
September's MAN of the month.
सन इज वल्ड क्लास🎉
Sonny❤
Vicario running to rolling Cuti won my heart
Their is something strange happening here...
Vicario signing of the season. // prior arsenal fan
Vicario this game is very underrated with that saves specially the first one 😊😊
Vikario😮😮😮
MaddiSon 🫶. But kulu's gotta use his right foot.
The lads worked really hard I say
Son for me is the best specialist in a drop ball.He's the best technician like Forlan but bug clubs wont buy him coz of being Asian
Pep is coming
captain son's style is back!
비카리오 진짜 잘막는다
Two errors, Two goals, Two brilliandt saves 😄
👍
히셜리송이 한 골 넣는게 보고 싶네여.
wtf is this 480p quality
This is my club, my one and only club  Come on you Spurs  COYSCOYSCOYSCOYSCOYS
Spurs pressing is pluto
Sonny 💯
Son, Richarlison, Maddison..this started to sound like mini Iceland NT 😄
To 1st place we go again 🎉🎉🎉
Yeah wait till you lot actually face a team that can play football. Then ooops.
The combination of Son & Maddison was amazing. But credit to all the players especially Vicario for his incredible saves, Richy for his assist & Hjojberg for his solid play. And our fullback duo Cuti & Micky..just wow 👍👍 literally every player did well. COYS 💪
A trophy  coming soon hopefully
What a keeper Spurs got ..lucky
Bro I'm a South American Man United fan and I still love Madders and Son...top players...
Harry what? Harry who? 👂 😅
Stupid Mistakes = painful punishment
Son legend
Vicario 🤞 though 😮
Heung min dad and heung min mom is happy at heung min son performance !
There is Son in Maddison
Let’s not forget about vicario this entire season, this guy is world class. Everyone’s doing great! COYS!
얘들아 토트넘채널에서 똑같은영상 현지해설이라고 한국 전용으로 왜 만들었겠냐.... 너네가 국뽕채울려고 영국인인척 구글번역기돌려서 손흥민 빠는글 계속 올려 자위하는거 댓글창 더러워지니까 그러는거 아니냐... 너네 국뽕채우려면 그냥 한국전용 영상에 한국말로 찬양해 안되는 영어 번역기 돌리면서 오글거리게 그러지말고 제발... 왜 굳이 영어로 쓰는거야
Very important WIN for us. Let's focus for the next game. Step by step
빛카리오
this should be longer! More replays for son's goal from different angles
첫번째골 옵사아니냐 ?
This season, Tottenham are cooking something nice. I hope the sustain the momentum.
흥민아 아시안컵 오지마 제발
이 영상을 한국의 김진짜 님이 시청했습니다.
I fear this Tottenham Team
❤❤
sony is God
New duo unlocked  Son x Maddison ✅  Vicario is a beast
great coach
Maddison and Son are a pair of nerds
For the first time.. I cannot even choose who my favorite player is. Many are fire 🔥
tottenham press caused both goals
Son is the player that will bring a title soon or later he deserves
Richalson's workrate in recovering the ball has improved so much .
우리는 손흥민 시대에 살고있다! 🎉🎉🎉
Super sonny.
Son is a world class.
Playstation goal
All these while Spurs were a one man team with Kane as the lead man. When he left, u can see that the team plays well together. I think Vicario will get more points for Spurs with his world class saves apart from the brilliance of Micky VDV and Romero.
Palestina
Romero 🔥
미쳤다손!!!!!
Our captain Sonny~~!! Forever❤
Manchester united fan here and all I can say is this spurs side is something else 💥
nice son
Maddi+son
My grandfather passed on this year and was a Spurs fan. I'm proud to say that I'm carrying on his love for this club ❤
Arsenal were talking about winning the league last year at this time, and any other team would not stop talking if they were first right now, and we have played arsenal, Liverpool, united and Brentford away🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Vicario is something else hey! 😮
Congratulations, Spurs, for winning the PL 23/24 (coming from a Cityzen)
아 새벽까지 안자고 본 보람이 있었어 우리 흥미니~~~~~~~~ 그리고 저 빛 빛카리오 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 실시간으로 보는데 미쳤다가 육성으로 나옴
#COYS I CANT SMILE WITHOUT YOU
I'm a Chelsea fan but seeing Tottenham play good football for a long time now is really impressive. Kudus to Postecoglou and his staff, I never thought for a second after Harry left they would kick off like this👏 ps: Harry would be a beast in this team now
손흥민 1골 1어시스트 굳 ^^
His father said He is not a world class.....
Son player of month September! Madisson, Vicarrio for player of October!
Spurs 💪🏻😎
Tottenham just need consistency to become champion
This goalkeeper Vicario is world class😮 is he Italian or English
Spurs fan and probably South African 🇿🇦
Vicario is unreal😮
Coys🎉
Vicario>onana
Sometimes separation makes someone become brighter. Congratulations Son.

What a team
토트넘 손흥민 선수에게 어울리는 금액을 책정해 주세요~
Son has an incredible shooting accuracy
The spurs goalkeeper ,vicario looks top ,top class.great signing
Spurs funs I told you that Vicario is a supernatural goalkeeper...Greetings from Empoli
Super cute and sweet
Vicario no 1 portiere nasional team
축구 그 자체 , 런던 그 자체 , 인류 그 자체 손 흥 민 .
결정력 만큼은 예전 호나우두 급
Dont tell me we gonna finish below spurs again
vicario have my babies already
ሁለቱም ጎሎች በሥተት የተቆጠሩናቸው😮
Good idea if we can loan messi from miami
The New Fantastic 4: Sonny, Maddison, Hicharlison, Kulusevski
Son will be top scorer this season
골키퍼가 정말 잘 하네요. 멋지다 키퍼.
good job, Tottenham
SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS o NYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Richalison very good as winger... So bad as ST
Vicarioooooooooooo
Son legend🎉🎉🎉
Playing from the back cost “Fulham” they should stop this nonsense m! 🤦🏽
wonderful son
what a goal sonny 💫
Nice one sonny!
비카리오 미쳤네 왜캐잘함?
Last year, we were sat 8th in the league, no European football, this year, we are currently 1st the in league, unbeaten. Ange for life.
Sonaldo did it again
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Lads are doing great🔥not a Spurs fan but quality in the play man..I'd like to see the Liverpool-Spurs rivalry back again
One match Tottenham wins and they say "we are back and we are Tottenham" like bro.
힘들겠지만 토트넘 우승하면 케인 슬프겠다
Sonnnnnnnny🎉
비카리오 로메로 반더벤 사실 우리의 공격력은 이미 쏘니로 인해 충분했지만 이 셋으로 인해 더이상 골을 넣은 것보다 더 실점하지 않게 되었습니다.
일부 한국인들만 sonny 까노 ㅋㅋㅋ 열등감덩어리들 소니 화이링~
Vicario is a beast. What a save..and a clean sheet for him.
Fulham shot themselves on the foot. You can't play from the back like that with Spurs.
토트넘  골키퍼도  정말 잘했다
No lgbt
as son says,,, in another classy interview, it was a team effort, so i just want to thank all thoughs that dont always get mentioned but r the heart of the team... richarlson, my man kulusveski, romero, hojberg, vanderben, vicario, sarr, udogie, Mr Romero, n pedro.. and all the hard working members off the pitch today...and last but not least, we cant leave out general Ange.,,,
at 0:52 son, now i can no longer see him do a long kick , but this one was a long kick enough
SON ❤
This spurs team is dangerous
son!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sonny's forward pressure drives them crazy
21세기이후로 제일 자랑스런 한국인이다
하이라이트만 봐도 손흥민이 얼마나 압박을 잘해주고 있는지 다 보이네. 진짜 열심히 뛴듯.
Kane ❎ Son 🔥✅
Vicario is such a beast. Like how in the world can he saved all of those shots.
흥민이 무릎슬라이딩 이제 많이 늘었네
Richarlison shooting is crap so woeful to watch ,he can't play as a striker,anyone in Spurs squad can score more goals then him.he shot off target is extremely more then on target. Spurs too rely on Son,if Son is injured or off form it's still a Spurssy team as usual. want to beat Spurs just mark on Son n Maddison n u can win the match 75%, without these 3 crap clown player,Hugh, Dier ,Davies, Spurs definitely can get the result n play way better then without them. They need to get a proven goal scorer in order to challenge the title.
I REALLY hope that Maddison n Son can get over their differences soon. Most probably just a case of miscommunication but please talk it out before the next match starts. We can’t have the deadly duo of PL at odds like this. They are still the leaders of this team anyway. COYS!
Nice one Sonny❤❤❤
토트넘 1위의 1등 공신 : 골키퍼..  Lloris 있었으면 1등 절대 못했음
Son Please Go To Liverpool, for winning all champions. Amazing Player
Good Tottenham Hotspur ❤
Spurs' pressing game is insane!
What a play for SON! He is NEAT and BEAUTIFUL!
Sonny legendaris Tottenham
0:23 1:52 미쳤다
I got a Son shirt 2 weeks back❤
The Champion😊
오늘 이유를 확실히 알았다. 왜 국대 플레이와 소속팀 플레이가 다른지...토트넘에는 챙겨줘야하는 동생들이 없었대...
이번 경기는 비카리오가 맨 오브 매치 다 하지만... 중요한건 모두 잘했다는거! 토트넘을 케인 원맨 팀이라고 한 머저리들에게 빅엿을 날려줘라.
Only reason Son is not talked about like Salah is the lack of trophies. Trophy drought will not end this season, but could it...?
son is so so underated
1:36 I feel bad for Richarlison
😍😍😍Great!!!😭😭😭
한국의 아들 최고다!
Sonny you beast!!
Vicario is better than Onana..😅
The three Sons are playing well.  As someone remarked "The Son Family".
Fulham committed suicide, - twice.
손흥민!!! 월드크라스!!!
오랜만에~ 멋진골을봤습니다 토트넘~ 멋져요~^^
My Son! The best Son, The best Player!
I think Vicario and defenders were really great in this game.
Why is son so fking good
Super son❤
흥민이한테 어시까지 받아고선 매디슨 스틸한공 흥민이가 더 좋은 골각 위치에서 터치를 했는데 그걸 스틸하냐?  탐욕이 니자신을 삼키는걸 넘어 팀 분열 일어날거다 부디 깨우치길
He is absolutely better than LLORIS
Нехер за голову хвататься! Петухи сраные
All tot players are perfect together
Well done postecoglu.👏..spurs class is growing.
Son Maddison Vicario 👍 👍
손흥민 화이팅!!😍
케인 어디갔어
앞으로 우리 히샬리송도 골 많이 넣어랏
Son Is World Class
감독이 잘 알아서 선수들의 약점을 지적하겠지만 시간이 지나면서 집중력이 떨어 지는 것이 눈에 보인다. 한두명의 스트라이커에게 의지해서는 우승은 힘들지 않을까? 로메로.클르셉스키.히샬리송.포르.비수마. 솔로몬.반탄크루.등 미드 필더 들의 슛 성공율이 너무 낮다.골키퍼 비카리오 정말 대단해요.  미드필더와 풀백들..많은 연습이 필요해 보입니다. 열심히 노력해서 우승 갑시다 할수 있잖아요.? 갑시다 토트넘 우승하러.
anybody miss Cain?
Oh Son, you do indeed rock!
Vicario is better than…..
골키퍼 잘한다..
WE ON TOP 🔥
Son of King.
Two times same Error from Defender
Nice win
SPURS💙💙💙
Deep pressing playyyyyy
I hope son will be the top scorer this season
Spurs on fire 🔥
Vicario is great transfer for Tottenham... Great goalkeeper
That goal scored by Son is more dangerous than electricity ⚡ 🔥
it's now or never.....champione, champione, champione.....
그 와중에 보이는.. 골기퍼 선방 미쳤네 정말... +_+b !!
이순간이 언제까지 갈지 모르겠지만 . 오래오래 그들이 행복한 모습을 보고싶다
pray for the SONS stay healthy yo guys, COYS!!!
토트넘 캡틴이자 레전드 손흥민😮
손
Van De Ven is good player
Lookslike spurs have hit the jackpot with all their Signing of last summer.
매디슨 진짜 잘스카웃햇다
압박과정이 너무 좋네 ㄷ
쏘니 폼 미첬다
Vicario is Incredible, Son & Maddison is word class but.. Ange is Legend
행복해 보여 ㅠㅠ
Imagine Tottenham winning the epl without Kane
😍😍😍 son
After Kane,  Son is the king
Bruh. Richarlison is as good as me on the pitch
Lads We are Gonna Win the League 🗿✔️
Maddi +  son
No doubt that Son is a lethal Striker !
Vicario is another level ❤
Spurs have become a joy to watch ❤️
everybody praise son and coach for this tottenham season but goalkeeper has done a lot , credit to him
❤비카리오 Vicario❤
Palhinha to spurs who says no ?
Fulham?? Build up ?? 😢
'Maddi` `Son`
Spurs are gonna make a history this season.   Well done Maddi-Son.  Well done Spurs!!!
happy!😊👍💕 nice! Vicario~!
Raul jimenez es malisimo.
Wow
What an unselfish play from son...that's why he's a capt!
Vicario what a save ??!!
비카리오 폼 미쳤다 ❤
What a beatiful moment son
I dont want to hype up Spurs as a United fan, considering the years that have been, but Ange is doing wonders for this club and i am enjoying it. It this is true and consistent, i hope spurs win the league :)
세계최고리그 1위팀 주장, 득점2위
Madisson make the diffrent
안녕~~~♥♥♥
Boys on fire 😅
두 골 다 전방압박에서 나왔네ㄷㄷ 전술의 중요성!!
Son makes everyone's ability as its highest level.❤
비카리오 슈퍼세이브! 히샬 어시! 쏘니 골 ! 쏘니 어시! 메디슨 골! 토트넘 승!
Son > Kane
와우 저걸 패스해주네
Change the weak Center backs..защита слабая
손흥민 폼 미쳤다 슈팅ㄷ.ㄷ
Son🎉🎉🎉🎉
비카리오 잘하네
what a match❤
두 골 모두 손의 압박에서부터 시작되네요. 멋집니다~
와우
I love S&M both!
Its not just Son and Madison That goalkeeper is lowkey underrated
Son is actually goated.
I use Sonny as number 9 in PES 2019. very good for quick counter
good press...   that make two goals!!!!!
Maddi  + Son !!!
손흥민 멋져요 ~~
Picture perfect! from September’s player of the month❤
욕심 많은 매디슨 ! 왜 손흥민한테 화를 내는지? 다이어 요리스처럼 손흥민이를 만만하게 보는건가?
Vicario is awesome
2 defensive mistakes… 2 goals. Huh!😵‍💫
백업이 너무 부실하다
Ngeri pressingnya
Vicario!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Son and Maddison. Loving this duo! COYS 🤍
Zero RESPECT for sprus u guy's on 1st place bcoz of Referee and VAR guys 😅😅😅😅
Did anybody else see Maddison getting visibly frustrated at Son for that overlapping during the potential 3rd goal?  I notice that happens almost every match actually lol. Son and Maddison are very happy together when they score, but they're also very quick to express frustration and blame when things don't go their way. Son does this a lot too actually. These "mood swings" go unnoticed when the team is doing well, but does become a factor that brings down the team morale when things aren't going well.   Anyways Spurs are playing very well this season. Maybe it's because I'm so used seeing them win, that I am noticing these finer details more often.
Son harus pindah club jika ingin trofi
Maddi+son🎉
Madisson key of totenham
Vicario was the best. without him spurs 2-2 fulham
Some great pressing
Son is a player who can surely score a goal in each game if he has the right opportunity or given the right assist. Likewise, He is a world class who can easily record assists as long as other teammates can score goals.
Spurs having their best season
메디슨의골..나이스 팀웍... 소니가 슛을 할 공간이 충분했지만 골욕심 버리고 가볍게 어시스트로  메디슨에게 완벽한 골 찬스 선물....^^~~
How many goals are scored when an error is made 'playing it our from the back'?
⚽️Sonny~👏👏👏👍🤗
Speechless
Well done victorio
1 goal and 1 assi
므찌다
손흥민최고! 빛카리오도
Son is Korea’s national treasure.
Oh captain my captain!
Richi was good but he need to practice on his shooting .....
Pride of asia =Son Light of asia=Buddha
High pressing from Spurs
Thanks
Don Ange Spurs team are improving game by game Keep going guys💪🏿 ✨  COYS 💪🏿💥
Harry kane was the problem
전방압박!!! ㅎㄷㄷ
Son Heung-min is a world class soccer player born in South Korea I grew up on the outskirts of beautiful soccer and I'm blooming at the English Premier League I always support Tottenham and Son Heung-min here in South Korea, a beautiful country I hope Tottenham win the Premier League this season And I'd like to thank the Tottenham fans in England Stay healthy and happy then
I would like to know how many goals  this season has been scored by the opposition from errors made by playing out from the back.
I love Tottenham & Korea & Chillingbourne. 🧡🧡🧡
교체맴버가 하나같이 최악이다
SONALDO ON FIRE 🔥🔥
Son completely success to replace harry kane's role
Son isn't amazing anymore.
토트넘 - 케인 + 메디슨 = winning team
Maning-Maning Si SON✌️😀
Love all spurs players ❤❤❤❤
Vicario saves 2 goals. MOTM.
Still waiting for richardlison to score
Capten son❤
Izin share
Who would’ve thought that Tottenham will seat on the top of premier league without Harry Kane.
Son is a very good person...give his ball to maddison
What a shoot, what a goal from Son!!
비카리오 진짜 잘한다!!❤
You have Son Goku. Superb.
stop leaking score results you idioooot
Vicario best goal keper👍👍👍👍
손흥민도 골 잘 넣고 토트넘도 1위 유지하는건 좋은데 메디슨 손흥민 나가는 순간 아예 다른 팀이 되는게 걱정임  겨울 이적 시장에서 좋은 매물 데려오는게 시급해보임
Cuti...👍
Love to see Son having such a great turnaround season! Tottenham are firing on all cylinders. Let’s go!
Though Maddison was a bit selfish in this game we all know that Sonny and Madders duo is incredible🔥 And wowww Vicario was a BEAST. Come on you spurs
FANS SPURS FROM BALI
우리흥민이 월드클래스 아닙니다 ㅎㅎ
지금 손흥민의 시대에 살고있음에 많은 한국팬들은 늘 감사하고있습니다 대다수 한국팬들은 여러 구단의 이적 제의가 왔을때 그의 경력에 우승 트로피가 있길바라며 토트넘을 떠나길 바랬지만 손흥민 선수는 토드넘 팬들을 위해 그의 남은 경력을 토트넘에서  마칠것으로 보입니다 그가 일시적으로 폼이 떨어져도 토트넘 팬들은 그에게 늘 관심과 사랑을 잊지말아주세요 앞으로 한국에서 100년가까이 나올수 없는 위대한 선수입니다 손흥민 선수 하나로 인해 수많은 한국인들이 늘 토트넘을 응원하며 우승하길 기도하고 있습니다
Son is the best
Incredibly Spurs has come to the top of four leaders of EPL.
흥민아 이번 시즌에 우승과 득점왕 또 먹자.😊😊
Most improve thing is their press absolutely amazing
Vicario ❤❤ Hojbjerg ❤❤ Son ❤❤ Maddison ❤❤
Son 💪
spurs juara liga inggris ketika kane pergi
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmazing
이대로쭉 연승이어가길 바랍니다. 토트넘 화이팅.
Romero is a great player
Sonaldo lifting premier league ? Actually none of us would hate it.
what a captain .. he can finished it alone .. but his assist will give good impact for another game to their team. go spurs!!
Son's pressure defense led to two goals.
Kane must be punching the air in Germany right now
Maddi + Son + Vicario = Maddison V
돌아왔구나 손태식이!!
world class
Son recently is like a fast Kane.
damn that defender pulled the same error twice. lol
son the next park ji sung
James Maddison has already been a gem 💎  for Spurs
look at that shot by Son wow.
비카리오 골키퍼는 숨은장이다  👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍😊
Son is literally the best in the world when it comes to these curling shots
look at that h.kane...u will be regret it
Madders was made for Spurs, the guy is balling like never before.
Son is not selfish
All Spurs player play hard on ground. Spurs will make a great result in this season.
LETS GO Tottenham ----잘한다 최고다 토트넘
FC 24 Finesse playstyle+ goal!
2x kslhan ftal kill you!!!
MaddiSon
두번째 골은 정말 소오름... 압박에 커팅 당한걸 본인에게 수비를 몰고 마지막에 어시....ㅋ 호이비에르 정말 일꾼이네
make a statue for Sonny in front of the stadium after his retirement.
MaddiSon, Perfect harmony!
Son is great!
Mudh2n totenham juara liga inggris  Bosen city city mulu yg juara 😅
V13
WWOOOWW !!! Tottenham Hotspur❤ hm_Son is World class.👏🏻  what a player. He is a South Korean.
Perfect kick! Outstanding Son!
As AN Arsenal fan, it hurts me everytime I see Maddison pulling the strings for Spurs. Man was easily our player for 40m but Arteta prefers Odegaard more.  OMG! I'm so sick to my stomach.
that goal by son...the word 'surgical' comes to mind
한국산 손까들 다 뒤져라
If Spurs win the title after Kane left. And Bayer Munich does not win the title after Kane joined. Haha.
Sonny 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Arsenal fan here: It's not like Vicario is world class or anything, but I have to admit he makes the saves we expect keepers to make.... And then more.
I already said from the beginning we can challenge tittle this season with Ange.. outstanding performance last night
Kane was the problem
two free gifts from fulham defender lol
Tottenham Go Go Go number One
🇰🇷 KOREA
빛카리오 최고다...2골이나 막았네...
captain ❤❤❤sonny
Never, ever, ever leave Sonny unattended around the box.
Lucky …
Of the Son, By the Son, For the TOTTENHAM !!
Top class Vicario
0 trophy
Sohn Heung-Min seems happier now than when he had Kane.
Nice one Sonny!! 🎉🎉🎉
No needs Kane
Imagine if Spurs won the league title the same season Kane left...
Vicario is the unsound hero this season so far. What a brilliant keeper he is!
대박
2 gifts
Tothenham on top of the table Kane departure is a blessing Kane's Bayern is also on top Son is exceptional
They just need to believe, and they can win the PL.
Sorry kane...  I don't miss you anymore
Korea Selatan memiliki tingkat kelahiran terendah di dunia dan merupakan rumah bagi banyak orang Asia Tenggara dan Asia Selatan. Jika mulai saat ini semakin banyak orang Indonesia yang berimigrasi, maka pemain Korea-Indonesia akan menjadi yang terkuat dan mampu meraih Ballon d'Or. 🇮🇩❤🇰🇷
Korea Selatan dan Indonesia akan saling berhadapan di final Piala Asia. Jepang lemah! Korea dan Indonesia adalah teman baik 🇰🇷❤️🇮🇩
Today's highlight is when Sonny made the opposing defenders express affection to each other before he shot lol ❤
요즘 토트넘 기세,팀웍 역대급!! 모두 부상없이 이대로 시즌 1위 가즈아👉
Just started new era of Sonny & Madisson
Son scoring from scraps again. 0.26 xG total vs fulham. Spurs need to improve or the collapse is guaranteed.
The last 10 min is disastrous.
손흥민 선수! 부디 아프지 말고 오래 뛰는 모습 봤으면 좋겠습니다. 우리나라  최고의 선수가 최고의 무대에서 뛰는것 자체로 너무 감사할뿐입니다. 항상 응원합니다.
Think this fan base including myself have never been so wrong about a player. Vicario is top drawer 🤍
1:04 "OUTSTANDING and yet, expected from the skipper"  Pretty much sums up Son. Nothing left to prove, but still delivers. Puts his body on the line and gives it his everything, every time. The type of captain any club dreams of having.
IM Gunners but really so like look spurs played this season. I think big Ange very fantastic job no doubt
Shout out to Supahans. We are Men with Ven
Vicario is My Man Of the Match.....
double son 🤝🔥
Number 10 and 7 like old times Just not Kane has the 10
Another great win boys we believe in ange p and the boys coys less pressure on them no eruopan football let's see how we and hopefully we can get back into eruopan football give ange p time Great start coys believe
mistake from the same player twice
Vicario gg
those saves from the goalkeeper 😮
Сон просто топ игрок
진짜 어떻게 우승 한 번 안되나 😂
매디순 이 잘했네
It's been a long time since Vicario, Van Derben and Romero Tottenham were so strong
Was not worried about this game like the past 7 games and sitting at the edge of my seat I  knew we had this one wrapped before kick off.But i am worried if we lose Sonny and Madison at the same time to injury they are the only ones that can create and score the rest have not got that talent
Kane gone,, son became legend
Son, Maddison, Richarlison, Jonhson
1 man gave away both goals 😂
난 한국인 이지만 경기가 꿑난후 운동장에 난입할수있다면 비카리오 골키퍼에게 가겠어 그는 영웅이야
손까 새끼들 부들부들 하구나 아하 즐겁구나 평일새벽🎉🎉🎉
Son is world class 🎉🎉🎉
Vicario crazy!!!!
Why no replays
Spurs❤❤❤❤🔥💯
빛카리오 와우~~
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🔥✨✨🔥
Hmmmm liverpool and tottenham should switch position in the rank table 😎
what a keeper, vicario~!!
Son the best LW 😊🥰
Saw on BBC Sport site someone say "take Son and Maddison out of Spurs and where would they be?" I remember when they would ask "take Kane out of Spurs and where would they be?" right now we would be top of EPL, that is where. Loving it right now.
man I love Vicario
Son Perfect SENSASIONAL in Asia👍🏽
wow Son is too good!
Back tolol from fulham
손이 주장된 다음엔 이타적인 플레이를 많이 하네 !
Van de ven the new jan vertonghen
son   Nice!♡
What a save.. Vicario amazing performance!! another clean sheet..
손흥민  최고!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Holy shit Vicario...!!
defensive masterclass far from what we had with conte
Wow Top on the table.. COYS
I love Sonny!  He is really cooooool~~~
손흥민 첫골 진짜 자신감있게 페인팅 후에 한명 제치고 잘넣었네요 예전의 그 자신감 있는 손의 모습을 다시 보았습니다~
There is 3 Son in Spurs, Son Heung Min, Richarlison, & Maddison 👍🏻. Good job Spurs
We can't be so happy and being easy. We still got  29 games to go
Top of the table 😤😤
It's great to find a vieo just to point the goals and some interesting moments. A 10 or 11 minutes video is too long for those who want to know the score.
와!!! 손흥민 슈팅 대포알이네
Wow fantastic. So happy  Tottenham is world club  So amazing
Who wouldn't admit? son is top class level❤it's Sonny's time 아버지만 빼고 모두가 인정한 월드클라쓰 흥민쏜❤
Son ❤❤
Happy for them!
Great save vicario.
No doubt ,Ange is very good manager ✅
그나저나 후반전 경기력은 글쎄... 벤치 자원들이 더잘해줘야겠다....
No.1 son 🇰🇷💙
MVDV singing has to be up there for signing of the season that guy is everything we needed x10
비카리오 우도기 로메로 오늘 진짜 잘했음🤩🤩
son! my son!!! my captain son
씨발 해설 칭챙총이라 했냐 ㅅㅂ
Tottenham only have to solve three challenges this season. Son's replacement, Vicario's stable passing ability, and Bentancur's return
What a save from Vicario. We actually have best players from all around the nations🔥
That was Mad, Son.
감독의전술이뛰어났다. 전방압박을 쉴새없이해서 두골을 만들어냈다. 엄청난체력이었고 팀워크였다.
I hope it's road to Champion
Que pedazo de gol Son 😱
Kebanggaan Asia, son ❤
spurs goal keeper is great!!!what a saved and big hand 🖐️ 🖐️ ❤
Trio Son is the best : Heung Min Son, RicharliSon, MaddiSon
Sonny..just killed me
Spurs won a good goalkeeper
비카리오 진짜 잘하네요 손흥민 2골도 가능했는데 양보 대단함
Super Son!
Spurs jual Harry kane sekarang jadi tim yang belum terkalahkan, MU harus meniru spurs nih jual Harry mujaer
토트넘 키퍼는 진짜 잘구해왔어
무적 토트넘!!
이번 시즌 토트넘이 큰 업적을 남길 것 같습니다. We are Tottenham, we are Tottenham, super Tottenham, from the Lane! we are Tottenham, super Tottenham, we are Tottenham, from the Lane!
골키퍼가 진짜 잘막네
what a win!
Tbh it was very dangerous at 2nd half
Makin moncer aja ini spurs setelah ditinggal kane 😅 calon juara ga nih
손케 듀오 해체 되니까 손매듀오 결성했네
Thanks for 3 poin ❤
Both goals conceded from defensive mistakes from Fulham
King Cario !!!!
첫골찢었다 오마이
와우 쏜형~ 골에 어시스트까지~~ Goat Son!!!
Isnt the first goal offside?
토트넘 감독 바뀌고 넘 잘한다 기세 안꺾이고 이번시즌 좋은 성적으로 마무리 가자
Sonny and Madison are BEASTS❤❤❤❤
Son's  dad:Heung Min is  not not a  World  class...
Vicario is wow.....
케인 없으면 토트넘은 중하위권이다 드립치던 아스날 레전드 할배 지금은 뭐라고 할지 리액션 궁금하네ㅋㅋ에릭 다이어 최적의 포지션은 벤치다 실점이 적어진게 가장 크다
비카리오 확실히 실력과 노력으로 차근차근 올라온게 보이네
Somethings wrong with kulu
The team that Ange made COYS
Clinical
Tottenham  hot  sperm
MaddSon looking GREAT!!!
did Son and Maddison have conflict at the end? they seemed unhappy..
One things I realise the different between last season and this season although Kane score a lot for spurs but as long as he is not scoring or slightly out of form the team lose but this season the team rely on not one person but the whole team
Seriously legend
Happy for all fans
Maddison and Son are even more compatible than Kane and Son ever was. Kane leaving was such a blessing. Son could finally lead the team and be free to score under a great coach in Ange. So much fun to watch!
Would like to see bentancur back in the mix an excellent play maker
son the next city players
Tots is cooking 🥶🥶
한국 새벽시간에 봤는데 쏘니 결정력 대단하네요. 축구보느라 조금 피곤하긴 해도 너무 즐겁네요.
how a team can turn around with new coach?! putting right pieces and raise players potentials! Ange, Son, Maddison, Vicario!!
When is Richarlison going to repay the 50 million that we paid for him
0:24, 1:53  기막힌 선방도 2골을 넣은 겪으로 잘했습니다.
Tottenham are really trying this time
Its not his first gol but stil love it ❤
오늘도 즐겁게 하루를 시작 감사 손 ^^
Vicario is phenomenal.
Last season Haaland dominated the PL, this year's all about Son. 🔥 Love to see him getting the recognition this year, what a wonderful player with a true captains mentality. World class! Well done!
I'm loving big Ange instead
help from refree
Edit videonya sayang sekali tidak niat 😔
Triple son
Vicario 🔥🔥
Son still amazing but Vicario woww golden glove is wait for him.
Son 🤝🏻 Maddison
Two same mistakes. Fulham🤦🏾‍♂️
Wow...... this guys is just amazing! Hands down best Asian player all-time!!
❤
Gass terus Spurs 💪💪💪
비카리오 비카리오. 진짜 물건이네...ㄷㄷ하다. 손메디슨 히샬리송 폼 올라온다. 우슨 가보자!!!
비카리오 선방 미쳤고 수비랑 공격까지 완벽함 ㄹㅇ
Vicario man. Gigi Buffon is back.
Richarlison scores again. He will be top goal scorer this season.
SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON~~~~~~~~~~
MaddiSon !!!
I have nth against spurs but they got too free goals today
선방 엄청나네 😮
Son 🐐
MADdiSON
who would've though, Spurs are better without Kane, maybe because Maddison and Son gets more freedom to exploited their opponent, while it used to fill by Kane.
공포 기록한 선수들 말고도 비카리오가 존나잘하네 ㄷㄷㄷ
The corean Man 🔥🔥🔥 (Pep)
Both goals coming from high press…….they don’t allow teams to play from the back. Hope Poch is watching
Vicario 💯💯💯💯💯
Son more super star than BTS
Imagine Kane , son, Maddison and kulesviski in the same team, it would have been the current best offensive combination .. Ange has exposed fraudeta in his first season, who keeps on moan about the time for rebuild
손흥민 화이팅^^
오우 소름 돋아
쏘니 짱^^♡
Vicario???🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This team will be winner finally this season.
리그1위 👍끝까지~ 리그우승 하자☘️🇰🇷🍀✌️
와..  우리 쏜 월드클래스~
2골 모두 전방 압박의 효과.. 쏜슨..콤비 대단하다... 골키퍼도 대박....
손 존에서의 감아차기는 진리구나
World class sonny and classy Maddieson
토트넘 화이팅 !!!  자국에서의 A매치 이후 클럽에 복귀하여 치룬 첫 경기여서 체력적으로 많은 어려움이 있었을텐데  부상없이 승리로 이끈 경기인만큼 정말 수고 많았습니다..  1. 지금 교체로 출전하는 선수들은 마음이 좋지 않겠지만 교체로 나왔을때라도 감독의 전술에 녹아들어    짧은 시간일지언정 자신의 모든것을 보여주길 희망한다..  - 토트넘은 이번시즌을 시작으로 다음시즌은 챔피언스리그를 포함하여 유럽리그를 포함하여 자국에서의    각 리그를 소화시켜야 한다...그렇게 하기 위해선 지금의 벤치 멤버들 역시 쉼 없이 뛰어야 하기 때문에    감독에게 자신의 이름을 각인 시켜둘 필요가 있다...  - 후반 중반이후 일부선수들 교체이후 집중력이 떨어졌는지 주도권이 풀럼으로 넘어가 제대로된 공격이    이뤄지지 않았고 위험한 순간들을 볼 수 있었다...벤치 멤버들의 실전 감각이 확실히 떨어져 보인다..    이전까지의 수비에서의 모습들은 좋아보였다. ( 빠른 수비전환, 선수커버, 빠른 볼 차단 등 )  - 지금의 벤치 선수들이 더 많이 뛰기위해 이적을 희망한다면 토트넘에서는 하루라도 빨리 백업 선수들을    영입하여 감독의 전술에 녹아 들 수 있도록 만들어야 한다고 생각한다.. 2. 각 기사들의 내용중에 호이비에르의 이적설이 계속 나오고 있다...  - 개인적으로 호이비에르의 활동량과 수비에서의 압박은 좋은 선수라 생각된다..허나...수비형 미드필드로    계속 뛰기위해 볼 간수 및 연결패스의 정확도를 지금보다 좀 더 높여야 하며 탈압박을 하기위해 개인    능력( 넓은 시야 및 볼 배급, 좌우 방향전환 패스 ) 을 역시 좀 더 높일 수 있다면 분명 더 좋은 선수로    거듭 날 수 있을것이라 생각된다..  - 또 한명 맨체스터 시티의 미드필더 필립스 영입에 관심이 있단 얘기다..    개인적이지만 지금의 필립스라면 영입을 고려해봐야 한다...필립스 역시 매번 교체로 나오고 있지만    나왔을때 경기 내용을 보면 대부분 걸어다니는 모습을 볼 수 있다..또한 볼 없을때의 움직임, 볼을 받기위한    움직임, 볼 간수 능력, 좌우 및 다양한 방면으로의 볼 배급, 선수압박 등 전체적인 모습을 봤을때 너무도    부족한 것이 많다고 생각된다.. 물론 감독의 역량에 따라 바뀔수도 있겠지만 현재로썬 아쉬울 따름이다.. 3. 감독의 전술과 선수들과의 궁합은 매우 좋다...허나 교체 이후 주도권이 넘어가는 것을 많이 볼 수 있다..  - 힘들겠지만 교체이후 선수들 특성에 맞는 공격 전개방법을 시험해 보는 것도 고려해 볼 필요가 있지 않을까???    전술 자체를 바꿀수는 없다...허나 공격 전개 방법( 히샬리송이 원톱으로 올라갔을때 뒷공간 침투보다 좌우를    활용한 센터링 및 등지는 플레이를 통한 공간 창출 등 )의 비중을 높인다면... 4. 이 부분은 개인적으로 가장 희망하는 부분이다...  - 지금의 토트넘은 경기내용 뿐만아니라 선수들의 분위기도 매우 좋아보이지만 우려되는 부분이 바로    벤치 멤버들과의 호흡과 분위기다...경기 종료후 선수들의 모습을 보면 표정이 매우 어두운 모습을 볼수 있다..    이 상황이 지속된다면 선수들간의 화합에 금이 갈 수 있기에 이에대한 대비책이 필요하다고 생각된다..  - 두번째는 공격 시 좋은 자리에 있던 자신을 보지 못하고 허무하게 공격권을 넘겨줬을때 선수들의 모습을    보면 모두가 하나같이 팔을 아래로 내려 패스를 왜 안했느냐는 듯한 재스쳐를 취한다...    물론 이를 지켜보는 이도 아쉽기는 마찬가지이나 이는 자칫 선수의 사기를 떨어뜨릴수 있으며 선수간에    금이 생길 수도 있지 않을까???? 분명 허무하게 볼 소유권을 넘긴 선수 당사자는 더 아쉬워 할 것이다...    물론 경기 종료 후 화해의 의미로 안아주기는 하겠지만 이러한 모습이 계속 누적된다면 선수간의 믿음과    배려가 줄어 들 수있을 것이다...    차라리 그 선수에게 팔을 내리지 말고 박수를 쳐주거나 지나가면서 등을 한번 토닥여 주고 "아쉬웠다"    한 마디 해주면 자신감과 다른 선수에 대한 믿음이 더 높아질 것이라 생각된다..  지금의 분위기는 안과 밖이 매우 좋아 보인다...시즌 끝까지 유지하기 어려울수 있겠으나 최대한 오래 유지되길 희망한다...
Vote son for Korean president 👍
What a beautiful team!!
As a arsenal fan James Madison is a blessing to Tottenham
물 흐르는듯한 손흥민 골 장면
황세라 짱이뻐
Super son
Son, he is a perfect leader.
Maddi+Son again!!
This game's MOM is vicario!!
Spurs plays better without kane cuz all players use thier ability to full potential now.
Maddison copied Son!!! Son is the father of the team.
저희 흥민이 월드클라스 아닙니다.     맞는데요? Son's father once on tv show  said he is not world class level yet. BUT he has become top class now 2023
I am just wondering , what’s wrong with spurs 😂😂😂
Son could come with whoever playing football Meddison? That's fine but i dont say Perfect. I want new conbination with Son!
골키퍼도 잘한다~~ 토트넘 화팅!
Captain  son best
토트넘 골키퍼도 선방했네
Kane was better 'player' than any of now, it's true. But we just focused on how to 'use kane' dat time. Now all squads are focusing on how to 'win the game together' and that's why we're better team than before. And who made this kinda team? It's definately Sonny.
BTW.. what a steal is Vicario. Such an amazing gk. I feel sorry for the other team We got an amazing GK!!
그저 “빛”카리오
Son, Maddison and Richarlison’s forward pressure was effective. In the second half, for some reason, the substitutes who should have been more active played more passively.
MADDI-SON! *copyrighted
Mate
THP No 9 bila berada di generasi yg sama dengan ronaldo brazil, dia gak bakalan bermain di liga inggris apalagi bermain untuk timnas. Paling dia cuman bermain di liga arab 😅😂
Son could've totally socred the 2nd goal but gave it to Maddison and you can tell he appreciated it after.. love this !
Tottenham sudah menemukan pengganti hugo lloris 👍
The difference is Sonny is in or not....
Son and Maddy are fantastic players. Only gripe is that Maddison needs to position himself correctly and not overlap in positions with Son. Hope they sort that out for the next game.
Son has been carrying Hotspur to the top team!!! Proving Son has opened the door to the BIG legend of EPL.
Soooooooooooooooooooooooon
Son could have scored 2nd goal himself but he gave it to meddison. What a guy.
손흥민 정말 자랑스럽다😊
Damn, Kane was holding this team back 😮
not enough Kane..😢
No Kane.(but) No pain.😂
Maybe this year is the time to win
We are on the top 🤍
another class
No one would have said Son was selfish for taking a shot for the second goal..... BUT Son passed it on to Maddison as Mads was in a better position!  World Class and Selfless!  A true Totteham Legend!!!!!  PS though my surname is Lee I AM NOT KOREAN!!!!!
Sob and Maddison are worldclass
축구도사 손흥민
쏘니 폼 미쳤다
As a korean, I like to tell that don't forget nice pass of Richardson to Sonny! Spurs need enhanced Richardson to keep no. 1.
모두 멋지다~
Richalson is better off buying and selling another player, Mikel Oyarzabal, who is suitable to play at Tottenham
Who is this Kane guy everyone keeps talking about?
수비수들 수비성공 골키퍼 슈퍼세이브도 넣어주세요 실점이 없어서 득점도 가능한건데 오늘 모든선수 활약 대부분 멋졌어요 😊😊🎉🎉
Son is difficult to discribe
비카리오 최고다
토트넘 레전드 손흥민 no.7
After watching this match, I say  "why not for spurs this year?"
비주전과 경기력 차이만 극복하면 진지하게 우승경쟁 가능하다!!!!
VICARIO 💯
Son is something else ❤.
Thank you, Son, thank you, Maddison. Thank you, Angie. Thank you, Tottenham. I'm in the lead. Don't talk to me. Arsenal fans are crying in the corner.
bro why is video quality like 480p
흥민이가 또?
Solid victory.
Son
People ranting and raving about Son and Madders but surely a special mention should go to Bassey, who was outstanding. Two assists, and nearly made it a 3rd. Top player!
World-class performance from Sonny, Madders, Vicario, and the rest of the team. Keep this up and let's shut down all of those haters out there. COYS!!!
fantastic, Son is world class!
Vicario is fantastic!!!!!!!!
와 대박 두 골 다 엄청 강한 압박으로 만들어냈어. 토트넘 대박! 손흥민 대박! 그리고 비카리오도 대박!!
Richy very good this game

Sonny is on fire again. What a team.
팀윅 캡틴손!
Serius mau tanya yg no 9 di Tottenham itu apa si fungsi nyaq
Semoga Tottenham bisa terus Menjaga Konsistensi sampai akhir Musim.... Son + Maddison incredible best player this season....
out-standing!!
비카리오가 있어서 이겼음 ㅋㅋ
Give credit to son People who said son is nothing without kane needs apology Or are you all going say son is nothing without maddison now?
son is Crazy
손흥민 폼 미쳤다 케인은 손흥민 억제기였다. 트레블 가즈아~~
두번째 또 한번의 감아차기도 가능했지만 그는 메디슨을 택했다.위대한 팀이여.
Vicario 10,  Son 10 , Maddison 10.
폼 미쳤다🎉
흥민아 다치지 말고 건강하게 시즌 보내자
Romero had a superb game. Maybe If Messi says he’s the best Center Back in the world, he probably is right
Vamos rapazes com vontade e amor a nossa camisa sempre 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
The Son Heung Min with Maddison is really compatible and scary, they are helping Tottenham fly high this season ❤
👍👍👍👍👍
Senang melihat perkembangan Spurs sejauh ini. Tentu saja, karena Spurs tak memiliki jadwal di kompetisi Eropa, mereka jadi lebih fresh dibanding tim lain. Tapi tetap saja Spurs musti menambah kekuatan tim mereka untuk memastikan gelar juara EPL sekaligus mempersiapkan tim untuk UCL  musim depan.  Respek buat Spurs. Respek buat EPL.  #forzamilan
마무리능력 또라이보다 위네
He makes it look so easy. And as for the team, i absolutely love their teamwork right now. U can see eveyone’s contribution in this game
Son need going to Manchester city or realmadrid i want see son in champions league
What a legend, Captain Son
손흥민~   겸손함과 지혜를  모두갖춘  리더중의  리더~  토트넘은  복받았네요
god of son
Niiiice. Long Live Israel.
I thought Kane and son was a goo duo but son and Maddison wow and vicario what a keeper
Sonny ❤ we are proud of you 🐓💙
와~ 슈퍼세이브도 어메이징하네~
손흥민❤
쏘니~~~~~~~~ 사랑한다~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lovely footwork from Romero in that final highlight.
This is one team
Kedua gool yang di dapat hasil preshing yang kuat
Son is  sprus sun  🌞
Vicario is an unsung hero!! He is my MOTM.
손흥민 개 잘하네
Madison is the premier leagues Bellingham
비카리오, 매디슨 데려온거 진짜 누구냐 칭찬좀하자
its always spurs no.7 & 10
What a save! Vicario!
홍 민 쏜
すばらしい
2골 모두 손흥민의 전방 압박으로 찬스를 만들었다.
our heung min son no ggab chiji masem sipsakidlya another legend class
Son, Maddi(son), Richarli(son), Emer(son), John(son). 😂😂😂👍👍👍 COYS!!
If Sonny has been playing as a central striker since the first game of this season, he might have scored more goals than Erling Haaland.  He scores many goals even without playing full-time in every match!⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️❤
Son is incredible you can’t stop him
Sonny perfect👍❤️
I always believe him and he get it.
love son!!!🎉
fantastic ~ SON !!!
손 메디슨 로메로 비카리오
케인의 심정은 어떠할까?
Sonny is a true legend, not Kane. We reached UCL final without him and we are off to the best start at EPL now 😊
골도 골이지만...두골모두 소니를 비롯해 전방압박 잘해서 수비 빌드업  방해 가로채기에 의한 득점 ㅋㅋㅋ 좋아요
song is God...nice 🎉
COYS!! 대한민국의 자랑 손흥민!!!
Tripple Son!! Big Vic!!
son is good at soccer
2023.10.24 9:15
At this rate it wont take lomg for sonny+ madders to replace sonny+kane as the best duo in pl.
Most amazing about this team is........Youth!!!!!
아침에 자고 일어났을때 손흥민선수의 멋진 활약 뉴스를 보면 하루가 너무 행복하게 시작이 됩니다. 손흥민선수 늘 건강하고 부상없이 행복한 선수생활 이어가길 바래요. 멋진모습 보여줘서 너무 고맙고 앞으로도 멋진모습 응원하고 기대할게요. 고마워요. 👍
비카리오 없었으면 어떻게 됐을지 몰랐다
spurs should buy some good subs in winter to keep this momentum
we were shit in second half.
Yes It is~~😍😍😍 Son😘😘😘
Top League in the World, Top team of the League, Top of the team,  Top of the World!!🎉🎉
손흥민 매디슨 비카리오 이 셋이 진짜 핵심인듯 2군 경기력은 진짜 작년 토트넘과 다를게 없더만
골을 넣은 장면들을 분석해보면 공격에 시작이 전방압박에서 시작된것을 알수있음. 손흥민과 공격수들이 전방에서 압박하며 만들어낸 골임. 현재 토트넘은 아주 인상적이다
very competitive....
Kane is the winner ... 🏆
That Italian goal keeper is legit!!!!
Vicario saves everything even while sleeping.
Mad is Son
So beautiful!
Outstanding MediSon plus that supergood goal keeper
23-24 champion spurs
손흥민은 염소다
Nice one sonny and maddison!😆
2번째 골 보면 그냥 딱 손흥민 감아차기 존인데 양보하는거 멋있다. 요즘 토트넘 폼 미쳤다!!
Is this my tottenham cos I'm really suprised
Sonny, who is more dedicated and selfless than anyone else but still gets called a troublemaker by his teammates.
Vicario will be the best GK in 23-24
👍👏🙏
Credit to the Goalkeeper
👏👏👏👏😆👍
Son is 10x better than rashford
Richarlyson uma merda
Even Tottenham press and play better football than Manchester united.. ten hag really a fraud
전세계에서 가장 민주적으로 운영되는 축구팀, 개인의 자유도가 가장 높게 피어난 축구팀. 토트넘 모든 선수가 골을 넣는 기록을 이번 시즌에 기록하도록 쏘니는 더 후배들에게 자신감을 불어 주어야 한다.그것이 진정한 레전드로 가는 길이다.
World Class! 👍
토트넘팀이 월드클래스가 되었다.
골키퍼 비카리오도 쥐린다.... 쏘니, 메디슨 비카리오 최고👍
Son of goal
What a fantastic duo 🎉
골키퍼 미쳤네 ❤❤❤
Tottenham can win this league. They are on fire 🔥
Sonaldo7🫰⚽
호이비에르는선발써야되 흥민이 골어시 기분좋다
Sonny~~~~~~~~~~
토트넘!!!!!!!!!
This is Sonny!!  What else?!
Was that not offside? Son's goal
We know son and Maddison is world class but can we talk about vicario this man is a absolute beast
I believe in Richardson! 😀
I honestly think that Goalkeepers should be rated based on their "saves" and not just mainly on "clean sheets". e.g. When Casillas was with Prime Real Madrid, he had some of the most "clean sheets" mainly because his teammates were monsters as well and always on the offensive. He only had to really defend when his defenders are failing. I mean, you can get a "clean sheet" in one game without really doing much as a keeper since your team is always on the offensive and would do most of the work.   Not saying that GKs are useless, just saying that they should be rated based on the cruciality of their saves.
Kane is too selfish, if he passes all his miss chances to his team mate, probably Tottenham will have win the league. You will now see the real potential of this Tottenham team. By the way, I am Liverpool’s fan.
Son a mom😅
Vicario is best GK  he is world class !
Captain's avenger
❤❤❤❤❤
히밤! 사랑한다 흥민아~!
대단하다
Do you know son?
빛카리오 진짜 미친거 같다ㄷㄷㄷ
whats with this dogshit video quality again? did they fire their social media person and bring back the intern responsible for the first few highlight videos of this season?
Son ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Son from Manila FILIPINO 💯 son FILIPINO PRIDE 💯
The best improved position is goalkeeper ❤
골키퍼가 든든하네
Maddison son❤

Duo son
Great Great Wonderful SONNY!!! Son Maddison Vicario are our HERO
Vacario, 17 mill. Now that has been a bargain.
If we win the title many I really mean many will be in tears with smile.
Shaky end but great game! COYS!
World class Son🇰🇷👍🏆⚽️🐐
실력도 인성도 최고!! 닮고싶다 ㅎㅎ
토트넘 골키퍼 선방 또한 멋지다. 손흥민 멋져버려!!!!!
chemistry of old and new players are sick. go spurs
손흥민 개멋있어!!!
I miss Kane but Son and Maddison duo seems to be the most light and fastest striker in the EPL 23-24 season. And also we have one of the best GK with excellent caracter now.
this season’s spurs look like made of sterner stuff compared to the spurs of old. there is more grit to them and can win ugly games. see if it can last the whole season but there is reason to be optimistic
Vicario is a top 5 keeper in the prem right now and nobody can change my mind. Some of the saves he’s been making have been incredible.
My sonnnnnnn🔥🔥🔥🔥
흥민아 축하한다 한잔하자
가자 스퍼스 우승할수있다
진짜 리그 우승하는거 아니야? 케인 우짜누...
Madison and Son are reminding us of Kane and Son 😅😢😅❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
와 진짜 우승하겟는데
'빛'cario
le meileur joueur, Son.
Vicario is incredible, holy reaction time
o!!!! my!!! god!!!  thanks god!!!
주전 다 빠지니까 콘테 축구가 시작 되었다
국뽕은 가스실로 가야 한다 개추
They are like Superman.👍🏻
Who hary Kane?
0:24 what a save from VIC 😮
비카리오 겁나 든든하네
Great duo!
Amazing!! Let's go!

Son ❤️
The spurs goalkeeper is so good
케인 토트넘 경기 결과 볼때마다 하루하루 괴롭겟는데
빛카리오....
역시 손흥민!
Spiner  Son !!!
Richy has been a great winger and had decent midfield action, but he's been awful on any shots at goal. I think he'll make more impact away from forward.
1:12 son heung min's brand new song
쩔었다. 기분 좋은 아침이다.
Calm play by Son near the box. I hope Tottenham's youth players learn that calmness. Warm heart but cool head. 👏👏👏🤍
GK Vicario  👍
쳐직이네요~~손흥민 화이팅
Maddison ⚡👏
sonny 가보자고❤
와~ 손흥민,메디슨 멋지다! 그리고 비카리오는 진짜 빛이네!!!❤
Thats why o really love Son
Love to hate them , hate to love them. COYS !
매디손듀오 덕분에 요즘 행복하다 토트넘 우승했으면 좋겠다 이번시즌 너무잘하는데
Could have been at least 4-0. Kulusevski keeps on getting himself into amazing scoring opportunities, and then he'll play a silly unnecessary pass where he could have just had it himself. Any chance that goes to Richarlison WILL be wasted, however, credit to the guy - he made some pretty nice creative passes. Still the guy just doesn't cut it, and he should be replaced by johnson for now. Son was amazing as usual, so was maddison, albeit a bit of confusion at the front in one of the chances. Van de venn impressed me in particular, he really is quite fast and so far reliable, making a great partnership with romero who always does his job. Them two allow ange ball to work, as in a back two system, whilst in possession, your back two need to be on top of their game. Kudos to vicario, his ridiculously fast reaction time has saved us more than it should have. That corner save was ridiculous. Thank God for Ange.
wow
비카리오 엄청 나네 이 기세면 시즌 맣 PFA 베스트 11에 뽑히겠다
손 지리네
가즈아~!!!!
Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooon~~~~~~~~~~~
vicario is a BEAST
메디슨 흥민 세레머니 한거 보소 ㅋ
이상적인 게임, 팀이네요. 손흥민이 넣고 매디슨이 넣고, 다른 공격수와 미드필더도 가담하고, 수비도 제 역할하고, 무엇보다도 골키퍼 비카리오의 2번의 선방은 대단하네요.
Super  SoN❤
Son is back..

Good game
이런 쏘니를 우레이??? 따위와 비교를 하다니 중국은 쓰레기인듯 ㅋㅋㅋ
골키퍼 진짜 개멋있다.
Ришарлисон отдал голевую передачу! Да, согласен, пока не везёт. Очень надеюсь, что он, как можно скорее, решит свои проблемы. КОЙС из Кыргызской Республики! Оба гола - результат отличного командного прессинга. Но после тройной замены расслабились. Есть ещё над чем работать.
MaddiSon🔥🔥
손흥민 is Korea's honor
이타적인 어시까지 진짜 미쳤다 쏜!!!
손흥민이 골 넣어서 기분이 좋다 ~~
Vicario..... Vicario Vicario!!!! What a save.... TWICE!!!!!!!
Spurs go !
손흥민이 너무 자랑스러워요 👏👏👏
Nothing beats  Sons and  his friends~~
기회가 자주 오는 것이 아니다. 최선을 다해서 우승 가보자!  우리 한 번 최고의 토트넘이 되어 보자!
This keeper of ours is something else 🇮🇹
It's awesome to see this team playing on the field. Really good guys. ❤
where is Dier??
NICE JOB SONNY, NICE JOB, SON!!!!!  ONCE AGAIN!!  Love this guy!!!
Hey Maddison Don’t break the rules of Ange
Amazing Sonny n Meddi
손흥민 메디슨  교체후  토트넘공격  실화냐 ?  완전  개그수준
New legend duo🤍
비카리오 개잘막네
oh  my  godshy
개잘하네 손흥민
Sons of Spur are kicking ass! ( Son,  Madison, Richarlison)
Good save, good goalkeeper
son
God job son🎉
MaddiSon !!!!
https://youtu.be/Gs6ygBvWh7I?feature=shared&t=42 What a run. This is the start of the great goal. Son made the scenario.
Son !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No doubt. Son is world super class.
손과 메디슨의 골도 좋지만 비카리오의 골 2개 선방은 미쳤다. 반사신경 ㄷㄷ
Son really went "fine, anyone english will do, then" after Kane dipped
치명적인 공격수와 철벽같은 키퍼  손,비카리오❤
오 소니 미친넘이네
비카리오 슈퍼세이브 👍 👍
what a nice goal
Son is gay.
토트넘 승리 축하합니다~!!!
son : world class ❌ son : universe class ⭕️
super saves & super goals
결국은 숀과 공격수들의  최전방에서의 강한 압박이 상대팀에게는 부담으로 패스 미스를 유발하게 만들었고 그게 골로 연결됫다 특히 숀이 전방에서 뛰어 압박한게 결정 적이였다👍 숀은 팀을 위해 모범적이게 항상 최선을 다해라🤞 리더잖아🤗
호날두에게선 볼수없던 주장의 면모
Typical son goal
bro spurs might actually win
2골 다 시작은 손흥민의 전방 압박에서 시작됨 골도 골인데 진짜 열심히 뛰는거다
비카리오 개잘하네❤
두골 다 손의 골키퍼 전방 압박에 의해 실수를 유발하고 뺏았은 볼을 골로 연결시키는 과정을 거치고 있다.
And there was "SON-SHINE" after the "Hurri-KANE".. !!
Getting rid of the absolute liability that was Lloris, and on top of that, adding Maddison who the clown Gareth Southgate doesn't fancy, is looking like the change that was necessary for Tottenham to finally win the premier league.
always dynamic shooting and goal. Sonny!!
Nice one sonny
우승가자   스퍼스 111
Today's game was good.  However, I am worried when I think about when Son Heung-min is called up for international matches.  I think the rest of the players need to improve their goal scoring ability.
문득 새삼 손흥민 대단
for Son, by son, of son
토트넘 영입 진짜 잘했다
It'll be funny if Spurs win EPL and BM doesn't win any trophies this season!  IMHO, Kane departure actually helped Spurs as everyone is contributing more now in both high press, offense and defense....
스트레스  확풀리네
Heung-Maddi-Son ❤
Love this team and Sonny 🔥
Son worldclass
전방압박 진짜 숨막힌다
두 골 다 전방 손흥민의 압박 시작으로  인터셉트 그리고 골!
Spurs go top that’s unbelievable
Maddison x Son💥💥💥
Best squad!!!!!!!
나있쑤~
메디슨 손흥민 안아주고 싶다더디 진짜 꽉 안아버리네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Are you staying up all night to cheer for us🙏Tottenham won^^ Please don't come to Asian Cup. You'll do well!Tottenham first!Lovely Sonny💗💕👍🎉🌿⚘️😊
새벽을 설레게 한 하루
0:42 ~  son goal   1:15  son assist, maddison goal!!!
이번 시즌 우승 한번 가자~~~~
손.메디슨 미쳤네 ❤
Wonderful GK
Harry who???
세계 어떤팀이든 손흥민은 골대앞에서 수비수2~3명 또는 3~4명은 달고다니는 경계대상1호..이번 경기도 전방압박과 멋진슛 잘했다
Cool Son!!!😎👍
Great goals 😂😂
비카리오 미쳤다 ㄷㄷ 골 적어도 2골 막았네
Like ange said Need to keep it tight till the end
Son making a wonderful goal, and support. Vicario making a great save. What a game.
Sonny 💯 Madders 💯 Vicario 💯 LETS GOOOOOO
히샤를리숑 응원합니다.
S.M duo fantastic!!
한국의 보물, 손흥민 폼 미쳤다 🇰🇷
굿 손이랑 메디슨 굿굿
Soncridible❤️❤️
Son is always incredible
They really gonna win without Kane lol
King the Great Sonny!!!
와~ 두골다 전방압박으로 넣어 버리네~ 쩐다~
우승 ㄱㅈㅇ
Son's dad was wrong!
비카리오 진심 빛이다 ㅋㅋ
토트넘 수고하셨습니다👏👏👏 오늘 흥민이는 대단했습니다🫶🏻👍🙏🏻
Ayam cayul😊
다 손흥민 전방압박으로 골 나왔넹
위대한 쏜~~~~~~~❤
Son and Maddison they're twins
Son, the Absolute Distroyer🥶
Captain son , Guardian Bicario , Galaxy  level COYS !! 👍👍👍👍👍
골결정력 지린다 진짜 ㄷㄷㄷㄷ 흥민이 ㅋㅋ
Vicario is fantastic
Son is living legend😊
Cooooooool
Vicario is the man of the match for me, two crucial saves.
The new numbers 7 and 10 are better than the old numbers 7 and 10!
Son+Maddison = win
Bruhhhhh Son!!!! He is the man. The man carries Tottenham. He is not greedy and selfish like Kane!!
비카리오 ㅈㄴ 잘하네 ㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌ
크.. 우리의 손!! 최전방 공격수로 골결정력 어시~ 뭐하나 빠지는게 읍네~ 최고의 전성기인듯
소니는 역시 이타적이다 😊
Nice
There is no objection. He is the best striker in the world
Go Tottenham for 1st rank in this season. 🎉🎉🎉
In my head ~~ in my head~~ Sonny Sonny Sonny~~~
Sonny❤
키퍼 미쳤다 2골이나 막네
Super goal 👏 👌
son is korean guy
폼미쳤다잉 😅🎉
Come on you Spurs we're flying higher to greater heights This is our seasons  I'm so proud of  how we've undergone transformation.  Madison keeps cooking 😘 Son has gotten his scoring boots what a player
Korea Best.
SON & MADDISON    VS   SON & HARRY         Which is BETTER ?
What's more amazing about the two goals is the pressure given to the Fullham defenders created mistakes in passing and led to chances for the goals.
즐겨라! 뭘? 승리를!
What the vicario
Let's go spurs~~~!!!❤
Son is best 🎉
Genuinely thought spurs would struggle without Kane
MaddiSon!!
Son zone: nothing but the net.
Sky is the limit if Spurs beat palaceqnd create a gap, its down to Daniel Levy if he will go all out in the January window, you guys might never get a chance like this again for a generation.
사랑해요❤❤❤❤손흥민선수 하고싶은거 다해~~~언제나 믿을꺼니까❤
오지게 감아 넣었네 흥민이형 나이스~  어시스트도 개굿~
SON!!!🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊❤❤❤
MAD Y SON
bryan gil should be given chance in place of richarlison
What a save by the Italian number one..i mean viccario
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
하 ～손흥민 너무 잘한다🎉👏🏻
I‘m proud of you
손흥민 🥰
요새 토트넘 화끈한 공격이 너무 좋다!! 시원시원해~!
빛카리오 선방 지리네
비카리오 선방 미쳤네
Top class High press!
멋진 경기..... 트로피 한번 들어보자~~~
바카리오 진짜 물건이네
wow my son
SON Z+D
Harry Kane thinking in his karma life 😂
Maddi+sonnnnnnnnnn!!!❤
glory glory tottenham hotspur coys
Son is Mad ❤❤❤
매디슨 욕심부리지 마라   팀이 우선이고 그러면 우승한다
두번째 골은 손흥민이 직접 넣어도 들어 갔을 것 같은데, 매디슨에게 넘겨줬네... 잘했다!!! ^^
Vicario amazing performance 👏👏👏
Congratulations! Son, Maddison and Tottenham!
손흥민 우리는 그의 시대에 살고있습니다. 멋지다 대한민국의 자랑
Pierre ❤ one of those great performances that goes unnoticed by the masses.
노 요리스 노 케인
I always watch every game, only difference is now im looking forward to it, last season I was dreading it
Sonny and Medicine are a fantastic match
와우~~ 흥민이가 넣을수있는데 어시스트하네 흥민이는 상대팀에 두려움의 대상이 될수밖에 없다
He is korean
I love Son and Maddison
Son and maddison are amazing together
MaddiSonHeugMin were fantadtic.
Vicario is a beast. What a save..and a clean sheet for him.
Super Captain Sonny❤ He's in my head   in my head❤ SonnySonny~ny~ny❤
started to like spurs after this New coach Ange showing drastic great changes - city fan
Sonny🎉🎉
손흥민 봉준호 김연아 다니엘헤니 퍽킹 레츠고!
감독의 전술의 중요성 저런선수를 콘테는 어떻게 사용한것인가?
MadderSon, so hot right now
Both Spurs goals came from intercepting Fulham's play from the back balls. Why they keep playing like that when they can't keep the ball pass the half way line ?
손흥민 어시스트 상황이 골 상황 보다 수비수도 더 적고 공간도 더 넓었는데 메디슨에게 욕심 없이 양보한걸로 보인다.
In your head in your head sonny sonny sonny eh eh eh
What a game!
이번 경기에서 진짜 손흥민으로 돌아온걸 보니까 문득 새삼 대단하단 것을 느낀다!
outstanding!!!!!
word class team from sony~~
오늘의 경기로 손흥민의 월드클래스는 증명이 되었다. 모든 사람이 인정할 수 밖에 없을 것이다.
Ga Ja ~😋
And luckily Vicario is in between the posts, COYS!
Kane? Who? We have son.
Vicario is so so underrated. What a crucial save
He's in my head. Sonny. Sonny.
Good job
son is the most unselfish no9. good assi to madison.
Shisi SonSon!
romero the best
Thank you so much❤❤❤
Still can't believe it that mr.spaletti choose gigio over vica with tremendous performance in the most difficult league
므찌다 므찌~
vicario…crazy defence
No Kane,No lose❤nice one sonny!
COYS
Amazing no Ref or Var stuff ups, great goal by Sonny, Maddison sealed it. This is a game that last year we would have lost, unbelievable turnaround COYS
쏘니 멋져부러 😊
World class son  World class maddison
난 예전부터 케인이 없어지면 흥민이가 날아다닐줄 알고 있었어...  아무래도 케인이 유스부터 성장해온 찐 성골 슈퍼스타이다 보니  케인에 초점이 맞춰져서 흥민이가 조력자 느낌으로 플레이해서 그렇지...
스킵 out
영상 감사합니다.대한민국은 지금 출근시간이라 출근하는 지하철안에서 잘보겠습니다~
Sonny madde duo❤
How can you be putting out stuff like Matchday Uncut and Inside Spurs and still post these embarrassing highlights which look like they were edited on an Atari? You gotta pay the highlights kid more, Daniel.
손과 매디슨의 시대가 왔다
Kerja baik, Ada harapan masuk 4 besar
손흥민 폼 미쳤다
Son classs
두 골 다 전방압박으로 만들어낸 골 와우
올해 챔스있었으면 쩔었겠는데.. 아쉽네..
He's  in my head    in my head❤ SonnySonny ~ny ~ny❤
Sonny ❤❤❤
전방압박 미쳤어 ㅎㅎ
손흥민 메디슨 그리고 빛카리오
vicario good! loris out good! dier too!
vicario is criminally underrated
Son's father said that "he is not a world class"
SON BROTHERS
Maddi Son!!!!!!!!!
Bro I am an arsenal fan but what am seeing shows why this season is going to be tough
토넘 1위 순항중?
요즘 한국어 영상에서 손까들이 안보이더만 죄다 영문영상에 모여있네! 손까=나라의쪽=일뽕=토왜=2찍이들! 😂😂
MadiSon🎉🎉🎉
son shoot! pass! mds onside line! best of best!
Sonny and Maddison, everything will be fine, right? the best duo
포스테코 감독님 ~스텝분들~~선수님들~수고 많으셨습니다~~~토트넘~지구끝까지 응원합니다~~~~~~~~~^^
히샬리송과 클루셉스키가 살아나야 1월 아시안컵과 네이션스컵 위기를 버틸수 있을텐데. 쩝
Double outrageous. Son is stunning.~~~
Wouldn’t play as well as we are now if we had Kane. Son is more fluid on the striker fole
손흥민하고 매디슨 전방압박 모는거 상대편 입장에서는 무서웠었겠네요..ㅎㅎ 역시 손흥민 부상만 조심하자 아주 잘하네요
인 마이 헤드 슈퍼 쏘니!!!!!❤❤
소니는 올해 어찌 골 넣는것보다 어시스트 적립하는게 더 어렵냐? ㅋㅋ 어쨌든 1골 1어시 했으니 올해 30 / 10 정도 해보자~~
아웃트로 브금 아시는분?
메디슨 점점 케인같아지는거 .....
Maddi Son
Our team 💙🤍
Amazing Super Captain Sonny❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ and  wonderful Maddison❤❤❤ Come on Spurs🎉🎉🎉
Greedy Maddison. If you want to become worldclass, THINK TEAM FIRST NOT YOUR GOAL. Today I was so disappointed with your complaint to Sonny. Why???
역씨 쏜~!!^^
One goal and one assist but not enough spoken about son's high pressing that led to both goals. Son initiated both goals,.finished the first and assisted the second
SON IS A BEST PLAYER
Crazy moment!!!
Vicario and Maddison really has resurected this dying club 😳
Its time for Vicario  Donnaruma
Very Good Start to the Season and Glad for the Win today But we definitely Need better Quality players to call on from the Bench...The Drop in Quality when We make Substitutions is concerning
손.메딘슨도 잘했지만   비카리오 선방은 예술이다.2 골 막네
비카리오 엄청 잘막네
احبكم توتنهام و مشجعيه
Not the best performance with Fulham's defensive errors being the diff. Oh well.
MaddiSon
After replacing the main player, the team showed performance at the level of the second division in the last 10 minutes. Without reinforcements in the winter transfer market, it is impossible to finish fourth, let alone win the championship.
Pucuk Pucuk Pucuk
1:51 빛카리오 선방도 미쳤다
SON is a legend
손흥민 메디슨 로메로 반더벤 비키리오 폼 미쳤다💯👍
완전 다른팀이 되어버렸네 ㅎㅎㅎㅎ
son...living legend!!
Could this be their year? Man City looks off their best.
Wow 흥민아 너가 골을 넣는 날 너무 행복해~❤  다치지마~~
nice one sonny
빛카리오...그저 빛..
쏜!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
저 코스는 손흥민이 가장 좋아하는 위치 👍
Maddi Son
손흥민 대단하네 굿 1골 1도움에 골키퍼도 2골 막았다 와우
손흥민 대단하네 굿 1골 1도움에 골키퍼도 2골 막았다 와우
Everyone did such a good job today especially Son,Richy,Madders,Romero n Vicario. Wait a sec,that’s like half of the team. 😂😂
What a beautiful team !!!!! COYS 🤩
Vicario blocked 2 goals
Anyonghaseo For Heung Min Son. Congratulations & Goodluck. Kamsamida.   The Korean Sensational.    Saranghae = I Love You For Heung Min Son.    Son Heung Min We'll Be Better.
I think MaddiSon is stronger than SonKane 😮
잘했네
공격엔 손매듀오 방어엔 빛카리오 완벽한 경기였다
COYS🇮🇩
Son❤❤❤❤❤
흥민이형 1골1도움 🎉🎉
흥민이 흥해라
son son son
MaddiSon back at it again! COYS ⚪️
The Korean Sensational For Heung Min Son.
nice sonny~~~~!
Pressing from the front, one of counter is to pass quicker that those pressing get exhausted quickly
토트넘 지금도 잘 하지만 히샬과 쌥쌥이가 폼만 더 끌어올리면 최고일듯 ㅋ 오늘 경기 잘 봤습니다. 행복했네요
Excellent Save From Guglielmo Vicario The Italian Sensational + Goal From Heung Min Son & James Maddison. London Derby Winners For Tottenham Hotspur Against Fulham FC In The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium Score By 2-0. #TOTFUL.    Commentator : Rob Daly & Clive Allen.
I'm so proud to be a spurs fan at the moment ❤❤always making me happy
Sonnny❤❤❤❤❤❤
Vicario best GK this season so far
메디슨 쏘니는 캡틴이야!!
가자!❤
Son offside
Son and Maddison looks like better than Son and Kane. They were also incredible and legendary. HOWEVER, SPURS found another combination. !!
손흥민 폼 미쳤네 ^^  축구 볼 맛이 나네 ㅋㅋ 손흥민 최고 👍
Wonderful Sonny, cheer up Tottenham ❤
흥민이형 진짜 너무 머시써ㅜㅜ
📷🎯
son 🔥🔥 nothing kane..
No doubt. Son is world class.
sons day 😂
i know it was a tough watch the latter stages of the game but i actually like how ange takes care of his players to prevent injuries. we have another game friday so wouldn't want players getting tired.
국뽕렉카 구라뉴스 보고와서 손메 헛소리할거면 댓글 달지마라 좀 쪽팔리니까
No kane? No problem!
son on top
Madders interview is truly disappointing on NBC…sonny got in your way!? He assisted your other goal
can i get a hi from the best team in the world ?
Before the start of the season no one hoped anything about Spurs. But they are really overperformimg under Big Ange. Son and Madders, what a duo!💙🐓🔥 No one miss Kane right now!
멋져 🤨 good!!!!
World Class Team 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Son and Maddison duo is incredible
