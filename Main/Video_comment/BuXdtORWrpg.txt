SpaceX has mastered their landings 🙌
Message to boss Elon musk please: I urgently need you to read this I'm just a teenager but I have big plans or bigger than big I won't divulge all the information but  I will speak one  The cell separator everything in this world and outside it comes down to cells so for example Water with high levels of pollution as I said it all comes down to cells and molecules so in water the dirt cells don't mix and with the cell separator a lot can still be created I've seen your story I'm not just a fan who just wants attention to get rich I want my opportunity to make my mark and make the future even more advanced please  Think about it let me have a chance to be someone extraordinary
BANG...BAM....BLEWWEIE !!!!!  GREAT WORK KIDS !!!!
that landing was CLEAN bro 😎
Fun fact: T+0 is exactly 420 seconds into the video! HA! Elon strikes again. Lol
Why does Starlink have NO customer service? 4 days without internet and no response from Starlink..
Starlink please come to indonesia

WoW 🙂🌍
Hey Elon, I was in the US Army and would love to be of the first people to put foot on Mars. I was diagnosed with a pituitary tumor that was unsuccessfully removed so I do not know how much longer I will be of use to Mankind. I scored so high on the military entrance test and finished in half the allotted time, so they thought I was cheating and made me take it again under close observation. I scored higher the second time and finished even faster. I would only ask two things in return for my service. 1.) Let me get one of your electric cars to use until I leave. (I sold my vehicles so that I don't run anyone over if I pass out from the tumor.) 2.) Build a library and name it after me when I die. EyE SEE YOU ⚡👁⚡
Very Cool 🚀👍🇺🇸❤
Launch control this is spacex we are go for launch range is go and weather is 70%go
Thank you Elon.  Keep it strong.  Keep going straight.  The three sisters are laughing.
Amazing😍😍😍
Elon - i like you
Throwing trash satellites to space.
Am i the only one who saw UFO's on theleft screen of stage 1 on frame 11:42-47?🙄
Hello, I am from Uzbekistan, does the internet work fast?
SpaceX rockets are becoming very smart by auto control. AI have helped the space field to move a big step and minimize the risk of failure launching for quipment and human. Great contribution!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1miMI139vI&t=7s   As I said before, vertically landing a cylinder 9 meters in diameter and 63 meters in length (first stage of the starship) is not an easy task, not to mention that in the case of falcon 9, its first stage is on average 48 meters high. and 3.7 meters in diameter. It's like putting a gigantic pencil on its feet, any wrong inclination can destroy the rocket when it lands. However, landing a base with that diameter and 4, 5, 6 or 7 meters in length is much easier, any country with a good spatial structure can do it. Therefore, I propose that the tanks be built with the cheapest materials possible, that is: only the tank cylinders would be discarded, if there were no conditions to be reused by another recovery system (parachute). As for the jet engines, they would only be used to return this base containing the rocket engines, and the jet turbines are an extremely tested and easy-to-control product. even on the rocket's ascent, these turbines could be turned on as well, contributing with an extra thrust at launch and up to 20 km when oxygen in the air is still abundant and could be used. Not to mention that this base is so small in relation to the rocket that even the small gables used for stability at the beginning of the flight, similar to those used on Saturn V, could be easily transformed into wings at the time of landing, in which case the landing could be on runways. normal. We live in a time of paradigm shifts and the truth of the past may no longer be valid in the future. We have to open our minds to the new. I am creating a model rocket company and as I do not depend on its profit for a living, I intend to use the eventual profit in researching new solutions for aerospace engineering, one of the topics I intend to research is this theory of mine on the use of Reusable and Recyclable Rocket with autonomous landing system, I intend to associate groups of experimental rockets with groups of model airplanes and develop equipment to prove my theory.
What a beauty!
How many of the total deployed satellites are functional still?
finally starlink is now not just a dream :)

UFO just passed by the ISS 1:30 hour ago.
This is beautiful 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Notifications getting lost by some notifications for another that shows only spaceX.” “ as when I asked if they were connected tO NASA even the said no! 😞..just got another one from them while watching!
9:33 they really need to stay with the ground camera on theses clear days. I need to see sep, 2 stage light and fairing sep.
❤
the stage 1 landing will not get old for me in a long while
When no one claps or celebrates as wild anymore cause it's as routine as an airplane landing. How far SpaceX has come 😄
I bet elon could go pro as torbjorn
Shadow ban??? I search for SpaceX and a bunch of hype channels come up, none of which I have ever thumbs up and all my SpaceX channels do not show up.
More space junk.
Good Job Guys
7:02 let's fly!
15:30 It's always fascinating to watch the kind of technology SpaceX has that enabes Stage one to land successfully 126 times.
My God, that is so beautiful to watch a rocket just drop out of the sky and return to its pad. INCREDIBLE!
I loved watching it in real life at cocoa beach Florida
Mars colony soon 🥰🥰
I’m still waiting for Starlink in my area: reserved a slot a year ago.

Nice to hear this host again.  She does the best job talking through things and explaining everything
🦚
To Space: You have all done a great job in the LC-39A. It looks like a dream come true. I would suggest that you had a permanent system of webcams (7-10) showing all the hard work that normally we (your faithful followers) don't have the right to testify. It is just a suggestion, because your own ideas have been great until now. And...  let's go to Mars!   😀
One mission per day.....one politician leaving the position......don't worry i am a silly boy
Jessie fan club 🙂
Goin' To Mars. Written August 27, 2003, the day Earth was closest to Mars in 70,000 years! Quite a cosmic cool connection!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZa2P6OVVsc
😎😇⚡️👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
Lovely launch, landing 🙂
SpaceX should really add *narrator introduction* in their small streams like these. I knew this one was Jessie Anderson but have hear before, but not all voices are recognisable.   Good liftoff, landing and video otherwise 👍
https://youtu.be/F75JXJVr93k
It would be nice to see a full screen of the booster falling through the clouds.
🍻
Another one in the bag, good job as always SpaceX, keep up the standard.
Whats the name of the song that plays at the start? Its so damn chill
GOOD
Hell ya
Always interesting seeing these launches from the transporter/erector. Spacex sure has a lot of erections!
When does King Turd, the philandering Musk Ox get strapped on and jettisoned out of this planet permanently?
Was that landing close or was it close. Legs only just made it.
Can't get enough of this, flawless execution. Congrats SpaceX

Someday there might be paying customers on a barge, protected by blast proof glass. Imagine that experience. I wouldn't fly to orbit but I would let Stage 1 land yards away. It would rock your shoes off !
с ш а   фантастическая   страна
Where are the youtube scientists who were telling me why the video loss is impossible to fix due to the shock waves on the drone ship antenna?
Has SpaceX considered a drone camera providing a view from about 100 yds from the landing boat?
That never gets old
👏
Oo
Has anyone else noticed how the insulation surrounding the MVAC engine pulses rhythmically like a heart beat???
Elon if it wasn't for Jesus Christ you'd be the most interesting man in the world.
I do love good CGI and science fiction shows like this.  Thanks.
This Awesome Show - never gets old!! :))
Gotta say it again. Entire rest  of aerospace industry: “A rocket that delivers a payload into orbit, then comes down and lands itself-on a boat? Never happen!” Elon Musk:”Hold my beer”.
Whoever needs rain tell him to take this big ass bottle rocket over there !!
I would like to see what happens on the drone ship after the rocket touches down.  Keep the cameras running and let us see how the rocket is made safe for transport
126th landing!
Always love the ladies doing the audio....
The1st stage came in a little hot this time! It seemed to be descending at a higher rate of velocity than we're used to seeing, but that's just me. Great footage! Go Starlink!
The launches seem to get better every time and Spacex must now be the most active commercial satellite carrier.
It was a beautiful day, great footage, first stage landed, and Jessie was announcing. SpaceX FTW!!!
รู้สึกตื่นเต้นทุกครั้งที่ได้เห็น
Amazing
They are deploying the legs closer and closer to the landing pad. On the right camera, you can still see the legs deploying and locking.
Alright......I have wondered this since day. What is the ball of fuzz on the second stage engine pipe, i see it every time. Insulation?
Utterly amazing how routine this has become. Once this level of routine happens with Starship space exploration is going to get crazy!
Always fascinating and inspiring.
I love watching the numbers on the first and second stages after separation envisioning the arc that is represented by the numbers for the first stage and the continuing rocketing of the second stage and imagining a third person view of the action.
Stop talking
Meh...  just the 8th flight.   What a transformation of the industry.
Guys this is awesome, amazing… CONGRATS !!!!!! Almost goong to see the airpleanes departure…
That’s best landing yet … thank you Starlink!
16:28 they are our neighbours
Nice work. I'd like to see fairing separation from the ground camera. I recon that'd be cool.
When I finally go to Mars, can she be the voice of the ship?!
Why do the boosters sometimes land in the sea and other times land on land..?
So you have no problem with this wanker shooting tons of space junk into shallow space, so he can con you out of another buck, because a couple hundred billion just ain't gonna cut it for one boy. You need to work on one of his factories!
Mr musk. You had a year to pay 5 million dollars. How much did you lose to Twitter? https://youtu.be/O0KyFG0l2XI baphomet is taking more now
ET phone home😂
What was the Stage 1 POGO Callout at 4:04??    Took me back to the early Saturn V POGO issues with stage 1 and 2  @NASASpaceflight - Any possible answers?
Beautiful!
😎👍
Great job to Jessy!
so epic! best landing footage!
Leg deployment seems to be getting later than I remember. Just got there in time.
11:42 when I see a flashing dot, among the clouds
Just yesterday or the day before there was one SpaceX launch, and now a second one - amazing frequency. SpaceX has made such launches routine. Kudos to them.
Great job!👍👍👍
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
They way I see it, spacex could have always streamed these barge landings, but they pretended instead there were “technical constraints” right around the moment of touchdown, until they perfected the landing, and now the barge landings are available for everyone to see.
In the Bond flick "You Only Live Twice" we see a rocket landing very similar to what the Falcon 9 first stages do. The Bond people gave it their best efforts, but real life is SO much more dramatic, and it's REAL!
sweet ride back down thank you spacex teams
126th successful landing... closing in on the shuttle record of 133... Can't wait for them to beat it!  OL J R :)
Why can't we see the deployment of the Starlink satellites???
Amazing achievement SpaceX!  The countdown audio actually matched the clock!!  Keep at it, and someday you'll get that fairing separated by the time it's separation is confirmed.
I just got a side friend putting it in the box ready to store home system ready let's go pick up made green coins and brown white blue and me let's go set for the month ready let's go two pennies good times food stamps and cash to receive two pennies suppose to be posted post
I can I can I can I can shoot shoot shoot
Shoot
This is becoming a routine. Notice how the landing is almost always bang in the middle. Can't wait for a successful Starship liftoff and landing.
Keys car and all home sweet home home car keys home sweet home store home car key store home car key got come on it's here right around something a time I can walk so what shoot
That might be the new benchmark for the smoothest dead centre landing to date. Never gets old.
always amazing.
We happened to be visiting Kennedy Space Center and found out SpaceX was launching. We opted for the tour to see the launch pads and rocket up close. So impressive when you see it standing there. We got to witness the launch and it did not disappoint. Impressive to watch in person. Last time I saw a launch, it was the shuttle Discovery. I love watching these videos but seeing it in person, really is amazing. It's a must-do.
Anyone noticed the debris floating by as the booster returns. What is that stuff?
Oooo, looks like the landing legs did a little more work than they normally need to do there. ;)
At this point, NASA is just very expensive grift for lazy, incompetent engineers.  SLS will only ever fly maybe once.   It wont be going to the moon.
I am so glad to live to see this advance development in space exploration. I was gifted to witsenss in person the liftoff of Apollo 15 in Florida at age 5. T/H mom and dad!
Just another day at work.
another fire cracker, going up and coming down..  lol..  next..?
another "satellite" launch?  YAWN.
"From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Matthew 4:17   "But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also." Matthew 5:39
Elon Musk is a homewrecker
perfection as usual
Too much commentary. I thought we were dialing it back.
that landing was soo smoooth
Elon musk is that you??!!!???!
Watching First Stage touch down. Never. Gets. Old. <3
Getting the cameras working is always the final step.
It would be awesome to see Buzz Aldrin go up into space again before we lose him. 🚀👨‍🚀🇺🇸
I wish we could have an announcer type of voice like from a football game  or soccer game making it more exciting to hear
I just watched the satellites going over my house in Catalunya
Awesome as ever!! Making it look so effortless, and yet no one else is able to even come close. Keep it up SpaceX!! Can’t wait for Starship launches to become as routine as this!! Go SpaceX!!
It's almost impossible to comprehend the rate of decelleration stage one goes through - from over 7000 km/h to 0 in just a couple of minutes - and then lands on what is relatively a tiny speck in the middle of a vast ocean. Tolerances must be to within a tiny fraction of a degree with those thrusters and grid fins. It remains incredible - even after all these years.
Not bad too bad, for a trampoline 😝
Awesome as ever!! Making it look so effortless, and yet no one else is able to even come close. Keep it up SpaceX!! Can’t wait for Starship launches to become as routine as this!! Go SpaceX!!
As regular as buses!What exciting times we are living in👍
16:29 UFO
Imagine the day we'll see the heavy booster caught by the chopsticks on a regular basis like this! before the end of the year??? go spacex go!!!! I want to see this.
I never tire of this.
yeah i just saw the starling from trukey like yesterday
Wonder that's the Sonic B00m is like at 15km high when rocket passes you by at that altitude?
Bullseye!
Absolute bullseye landing…. 🤩 Nothing short of exceptional, feels like we’re witnessing the future…. NOW!!!!!!! 🫡✌️☮️
No matter how many times I see this. It’s always incredible. And getting better every time.
Amazing.
just think how busy the FSB agent that as to write up a security threat report every time space x launches a starlink mission must be
Bad to the bone again.  Great view all the way down from both the drone ship and the booster.
The announcer should mention that right after the fairing separation, when they switch back to the engine view, (9:58)on the right screen, just to the left of the engine bell you can see the fairing falling back to Earth.
Lots of pollution!
Question: what is causing the ‘pulsing’ of the alloy shroud covering the second stage; it’s like a heart beat? I assume it’s a pump possibly, but it’s a pretty slow beat for that?
Strange to see the pulsating of the foil cover on the second stage. Never seen it do that before. Made me wonder if there was a propellant gas leak or a partial engine instability causing thrust pulsations. What does anyone else think?
We saw the string of satellites moving across the sky overhead here in Montana last night.
SpaceX rockets flights are getting smoother than modern air travel...
Every launch from now on is a record, that's pretty AWESOME 🤩 Go SpaceX 🚀👏👏
Getting boring, way too easy now.
One of the best views of these that I've seen!!!    Still want to know: What happens to the 2nd stage???
It never gets old seeing that landing.
Finalmente no hubo caída de señal de video durante el aterrizaje desde la plataforma y del booster. Me parece bastante ilógico de parte de ellos teniendo ya activa la red starlink que opera a tan alta altura y con excelente ancho de banda para poder recibir y transmitir esos datos sin problemas
The first stage landing gets me hype every single time! 👏🏽
Just saw those starlink satelites fly over Greece👍👍
i like to see at launch the new tower in construction lmao
anyone think the california fires are started on purpose..
WOW es increíble , siento que presencialmente se ve mucho más impresionante .Podría quizás ir como trabajadora de limpieza y ver eso?🥺😅. Hace unos cuatro minutos salió una notificación sobre el que quería comprar una red social , parece que habrá más polémica alrededor de el nuevamente...
I liked it better without the constant yammering commentary. I've gotten to where I just turn the volume down except for the launch itself.
FIFTY THREE more satellites? 😭 Good god lol
Finally a good landing video
Another Booster Bullseye, SpaceX sticks the landing again, just like Friday. 👏
🤗👏👏👏😎💚🎶😍😍😍
As Ed Bassmaster would say..."Oh would you look at that".
Why is the covering on the 2nd stage beating like a heart?
Amazing effort once again well done.
:52 seconds into launch nice pressure wave
Enjoyed another great launch and landing but video was marred by a large white rectangle blocked about 1/4 of the screen.
No video cutout on landing! Amazing work to do that! Best one yet! Amazing work to keep a stable connection through all that time and environmental changes
Yes this is fab watching tons of petrol, oil, going up in smoke! Liquid oxygen? I thought ,i am stupid, that oxygen was a gas in the air we breathe? Have you taken all the oxygen from the air? And thats why its dry?  I Dont expect an answer, i might be fick, however, i dont pretend to be anything other!
Nailed it!!
thank you for sharing, always inspires me, greetings from Peru
4th launch in a week??? SpaceX making launching rockets feel like it's nothing 💀
Too much talking!! Can we get a second channel that is just rocket audio with no talking?!? Thanks for the consideration!
Fun fact: Satellites are basically continuously falling, But if they're moving at the right speed, they fall at the same rate that the curve of the Earth falls away from them.
At 70 km stage separation is confirmed. There is no longer any thrust from the Merlin engines which have already been shut down. But the first stage continues flying upwards for another 65 km purely using its momentum...
I remember watching the Gemini and the Apollo nail biting missions on tv back in the 60's---wondering whether they were going to make it back.Now its a walk in the park.
It's amazing the rate they are launching these. I can only imagine how busy they are making all these satalites.
Elon Musk, the closest thing we'll get to a real life Tony Stark in our lifetime, probably.
Awesome landing
What was the pulsing on the second stage after stage seperation?
Starship will have to make this landings perfect all the time. It's good practice for Spacex in my opinion.
🚀🛰️🎉🎊🇲🇲🇭🇹🇦🇫🇺🇦 ⋯⋯🤡🇬🇧🇺🇸🫡🫶🫰👍
إن شاء الله سيكتمل المشروع مع نهاية العالم 😏
This is as close to a religious experience you can get,  as an atheist.    Love this......   😁
nice，shutdown CCP need your help.🇺🇸
The stage 2 covering, which normal hardly moves, was twitching and pulsing like a box of frogs:  anyone know what this was all about?  Thanks.
we've seen it over my town too
I love that this has become so automatic.  Space x is great
I don't believe in coincidences, but holy cow, how the landing on the drone ship and the SECO-1 happen almost simultaneously, is this chance or science?
Epic🤌👏
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think landing number 1000 will still be as impressive. Never gets old to watch 🖖
Boy the webcasts sure have gotten shorter!
What's the point of these satellites? Is this part of a military contract?
16:31 im banned from r/UFOs for pointing out the truth so id appreciate and give credit my username is r/fuckufomods. is this how starlink first deploy? randomly floating in space and then docking to one another? cause i see a UFO going towards earth and another one at a considerably higher speed but in the opposite direction.
So routine now. Boeing has NOTHING on them nor any other private space company
How do we know this is a different launch? It could be footage of any of the previous launches. After all, howmany of those things can you put in orbit before people start crashing into the trying to get to the ISS or even the moon???
Again  . . .  and perfect !!
Good job
Never. Gets. Old.
SpaceX, you make this look so easy. Great engineering and great teams.
Afmazing
Absolutely,positively.........NEVER GETS OLD.....nice job...Everyone!
What happens to the 2nd stage?  Burns up and adds more space junk?  When will that end and return to earth to be reused...if ever.  The low earth atmosphere cannot continue to accumulate this level of debris.
What SpaceX does never ceases to amaze me!
Hi Jesse,  it's a success when you are around for SpaceX Missions 🙏🙏🙏
I'm old and have seen the entire NASA rocket program since Mercury. It was always a given that you can't land a rocket on its tail.  Turns out, not so much. Blows my mind every time, and right on the money too. They've got this figured out.
Wow just wow.
Just a thought . . . your commentator always describes "Max Q" as "the point where Falcon 9 sees the highest dynamic pressure".  The rocket doesn't "see" anything.  How about, "the point where the Falcon 9 vehicle experiences the highest dynamic pressure".  Again, just a suggestion for a more accurate description of the event.
I forget.  What happens to the second stage?
Why is there a 2 minute intro with just SpaceX logo?  5 seconds would suffice….
I've watched dozens of these launches and it's a huge thrill every time.
Wooow....
Russia and China are seething...
What a landing. That was sweet as a nut! 👍 That's how you do it our Jeff!
This is the first launch I ever got to see in person. It's an incredible experience for anyone who is interested in space!
Need more starlink sats. Here in Charleston SC it works great, but if I go to NC I have no coverage
The quality of the video coverage is as always outstanding!
I will never get tired of this view
Dear #ElonMusk ❤️❤️❤️ Beautiful...fantastic!!
Impressive video feeds.
Why can’t we stay with it to watch the release of the payload.
I never get tired of watching stage one landings.  Waiting though to see a starship booster landing.
Pretty amazing.
Love the rockets. Hate the satellites and trash in space
DOGE
They no longer show the coast phase and the deployment of the Starlinks.
0 Emissions and Carbon Neutral. Well done space x
Astra so jelly
Nicely done on another launch and in the uninterrupted views all the way down.  I hope Jessie gets tapped to narrate and host the Starship orbital test flight. I much prefer her to the minimalist commentary of some other more recent launches.👍
They can quit saying attempt to land.
When we getting spaceships on VEVE from Spacex Elon (DOGEKING) Musk :)
Landed off center, what is this, amateur hour?
So another set of anti ballistic Misille  satellites got launched?? Sweet!
WOW
Missed it! Sorry! :(
I’m watching the StarLink launch with my StarLink internet service.
Lift off looks so easy. Those engines are quite impressive.
Amazing stuff.  Whatever happens to the second stage after deploying the cargo?
Can't wait for the 90 deg and 70 deg inclination satellites and subarctic coverage!
Great landing footage!!
I'm curious just how much it costs each time they have one of these lift offs for the satellites.
I like how they said they will shut down all 9 MVAC engines when they clearly meant all 9 Merlin 1D engines.
This never gets old or boring. Thank you for sharing. 👏👏👏😎
good job spacex good job... I do miss seeing your announcers, I thought it was always to spacex credit that they used real people and not some plastic-like PR person like NASA and others do.  And now you've even stopped even giving them a screen credit ?? I don't get that, anyway it is your broadcasts that where the best that I judged all the others against.
Oh man, that feel when touch down happened so smoothly. What a landing !!! I love this tech
Never gets old.
Master peace 😀😀
Exciting how it became so boring😀
Super smooth
Seeing the first stage land on the drone ship never gets old.  Added bonus when both views work. Just amazing
What are those wires that come off the mvac when it ignites?
Got it down to a science! Never tire of watching this marvelous work from all of our space dreamers!
I'm happy that ukraine has lots of internet access.  I'd be happier if the product I put a deposit down on over 1.5 years ago.. the day I got the email from spacex.    Now people are able to drive around with them and use them on boats and such..  but I still have to battle with att for the only connection available to me.   a 300kb dsl connection that sometimes gets as high as 250k. Hurry up and take, the rest, of my money!    Cool also that the price increase will help cover the cost of all that ukraine swag.   I comment here because there is NO way to communicate with starlink or spacex about starlink
Exciting every single time.
👍👏👍🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🤸
Best landing video I have ever seen, none of the screens were interrupted, it all went silky smooth, zohan would say.
damn thats a amazing landing
🤍🔆
Could you please stop littering Earth's low orbit please?
Show us the deploy. Please!
So cool to see the legs extending at last possible moment on the BargeCam. WOW!!
What were all the items under the first stage, bottom left, T+3:30 - 4:00?
Thanks! Appreciate the work the team puts into making these launches publicly accessible.  Fun to see the tower going up near 39A
Booster landing have become so common, people don’t even cheer for it anymore.
Was a bit scary how steep the re entry trajectory was. 😅
best video of a landing I have seen yet!!!!
Astonishing to wrap your head around what a spectacular achievement this is. Totally amazing!
So nice to see the interrupted landing of stage 1!  I never get tired of seeing this amazing technology.
Thank You SpaceX! Again! and Again!
Great landing!
How many flights has SpaceX done compared to NASA at the same point in time?
Congrats! Any comment from SpaceX side on why they stopped showing satellite deployment on their launch livestreams? These are just as awesome visuals as the landings imo (even if technically less challenging).
I love how everybody is just so chill like they’ve done this a million times
@spacex stop playing with Falcon HEAVY and launch it.....!!! lol lol
It’s now routine surgical. Congrats SpaceX team.
It's unreal watching that landing.
What better way to advertise Starlink than to have a seamless HD video stream from two sources showing the continued evolution of the services that Starlink will provide. Bravo
Booster landing is *STILL* the coolest thing ever.  I will never find it old.
Is it just me, or do the second stage cameras looked flipped? The image from the camera that is closer to Earth should be rotated 180 degrees. When they switch camera views, it looks like it is going east to west.
Just 15 years ago it sounds unbelievable. Amazing how this launches now become smooth and "boring"....
I miss the old format. More information and host on screen. Bring it back!
I can’t imagine how much effort the team had to put into getting the uninterrupted landing footage. Congrats Jami and team at company X😁
👏🚀
Lets go spaceX
What causes the metal foil covering the second stage engine to quiver every other second or so? Is there course correction going on, by those nitrogen gas engines?
Meu programa preferido
Millions starve while Over 40's   play toys  with Billions. Its just disgusting on almost every level. balance must be restored at some point. It wont come soon enough.
Brilliant coverage of another seamless launch although i would question the commentator when she says, 'Main engine cut off is where we shut down all nine of those Mvac engines'. I thought there was only one Mvac engine and that was on the 2nd stage, the first stage engines are optimised for the atmosphere, not for a vacuum.
Why no video of the announcer / presenter?  It made the launch coverage more friendly and personal. I also miss the progress updates of the starlink system itself.  I know they have a very busy launch schedule, but I don't see why they still can't have video of the announcer and a brief system update.  How many satellites will this make in orbit, ground system upgrades, new functionality / products, new user areas, etc.
This the third one this week?
so many rocket launches increasing your temperature there and burning forests
Just flew with a guy at my airline, he never knew you can land and reuse rockets. I would say the majority of people out there are not aware of what's going on at SpaceX.
06:50
Anybody know what that white stuff is floating around behind stage one after stage separation? (9:51) Looks like blocks of ice or styrofoam. You see this at every launch. Where does it come from?
Congrats SpaceX! 😎💪
The _land_ in Newfoundland rhymes with _band._ 🙂
Why do we not get to see the deployment anymore??   I know it adds time to the  stream, it is just nice to have a big finish at the end.     Keep going SpaceX, It would be soo awesome to see you land on the moon with humans before for any other space agencies does.    👍👍🍺🍻🍺🍻
54 is my favorite number. So I feel inclined to ask: Why not two stage ones on top of each other and make it fully recoverable?
Launching satelite daily🔥🥳
TIME STAMPS:  Liftoff: 6:56 Max-Q: 8:15 MECO: 9:27 Entry: 13:53 Landing: 15:28
The Vox off is 😍 congratulations to SpaceX and to all workers.
Nice Visuals.  Excellent footage.
SpaceX is getting better and better. This was a perfect landing, smoother and more accurate then a year ago. Can't wait to see the Starship.
Genial 👍🏼.  Gracia
Love watching starlink launches via starlink.
Always wondering why we dont see the zero speed on the first stage.
Superb landing and coverage.  Landing rockets on a boat has become "normal" .
Congratulations SpaceX
Whoa!!!! Stage 1 had perfect video on the entire decent! Woo hoo!!!! Way to go SpaceX Team! That was amazing!!!
Bravo!
Gorgeous video of the first stage landing!
I keep forgetting this gals name, but it’s nice to hear she’s back and providing launch updates.
Again?? Wasnt the other launch just yesterday or smth
Sung to a popular song:  Op nin’ my beer top Watchn’ my roc-ket flop Sounds real loud, but don’t go to the moon I want it to blast off Not make’n my heart cough  Just goes up and then comes down real soon  Waste’n away, try’n to get to space Drink a lot and, it makes me go p133 Some people claim that E-lon Musk is to blame,  Cause he says, “Bozo” “Hold my beer and watch this”  Have a new girl-friend Loves me a lot and then Lights the fuse and starts run’n a-way I try not to bribe her By buy’n some more fur But she laughs when it fizzles and stays  Waste’n away try’n to get to space Drink so much that, it makes me go p133 Some people claim that E-lon Musk could be the blame  Cause he used to say, “Bozo” “Hold my beer and watch this”  Got to the bathroom Had to go real soon When my girl-friend said, “Hurry let’s play” I zipped up my britches She had me in stitches While she’s a’ watchn’ it fly’n away  Wasted away I watched it get to space Drink a lot and, can’t wait to go p133 Some people claim that E-lon Musk WAS the blame,  But now I says, “Baby”: “Hold my beer and watch this!”
14:56 : Stage One Transonic   Repeat & Enjoy the landing
These are becoming as reliable as people's cars
Never gets old to see these launches and landing.
WOW!!.............. just....WOW !!!
Why has starlink been down for the last 2 days all across the country
We need the first Mars Lander to be called "My Ass" because it will be cool when "My Ass" sets down on Mars
Well done SPACEX!
星链+海钓直播交易平台！！！！！！完美！！！！！！
Love watching these evolutions. Never gets boring! Go SpaceX
Don’t be fooled this is Reagan’s Star Wars program (strategic defense initiative) better late than never…
I miss the 1.5 hour feeds, just saying.... @SpaceX
Суперрррр!!!!
12:53 there is a black ball flying in the clouds on the left camera
Super, Super, Super!!!👍👍
Why did it seem that the foil on the second stage was moving so much? Its like it had a beating heart never noticed it before.
Casual launch=)  Remember guys how it'll be 5-6 years ago...
I know the satellite deployment is the main show, but watching the first stage land is just never going to get old!
Awesome lift off   What a view back to earth.    Very good the split screen.   WOW perfect landing!
👏👏👏
Brilliant landing Space X, thanks for the videos. 😃🌝
Just how many more starlink missions are there going to be?
Why do you guys keep cutting off the end of the video before the satellites deploy from the launch vehicle?
This is the fifty-fourth starlink mission.
a bit bumpy
The 1st stage landings never get old!
Man that never gets old!
Best landing yet!
Another great job, Go SpaceX.
Elon Musk changing the world 🌎 a car 🚗 and a rocket 🚀  at a time.... o.o amazing.....
“I feel very strongly that SpaceX would not have been able to get started, nor would we have made the progress that we have, without the help of NASA.”
15:40 This Was The Historical Landing Ever
I do not mean this question to sound so weird, but it probably will.  Why are we launching ridiculous amounts of satellites lately just because we can?  Like every other day it seems.  What's the purpose of launching more?  Are that many more people using Starlink, or is this a strategic thing?
이번주에만 3번째 스타링크 미션? 스페이스X는 이제 뒷집 잔디 구경가듯 위성을 쏘아올리는군요; Unbelievable!!!
Awesome landing of stage 1.
Батутная система работает без сбоев !
SpaceX is on track this year to launch more missions than the rest of the world combined
Wow! Congrats on another successful launch. 😊
Sad they don't show the deployments anymore! A mere tweet doesn't do it justice!
Another awesome launch/deployment, can't wait to get my starlink
I don’t know, but this landing has been the craziest I’ve seen yet. It looked like the booster was coming down at an angle and was either over- or undershooting the barge… aptly named a shortfall of gravitas…
DEAR EVERYONE AT SPACEX,   GOD BLESS YOU MY FRIENDS.  I AM VERY PROUD OF YOU AND VERY HAPPY FOR YOU.  I HOPE ALL OF YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE.  I LOVE  YOU.  I LOVE SPACEX.     GOD BLESS YOU MR. MUSK.

I HOPE YOU HAD THE BEST AND HAPPIEST 4TH OF JULY OF YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.   I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL AND THANKFUL. EVERYTHING HAS BEEN A MIRACLE AND FAR BEYOND MY WILDEST DREAMS.  I ABSOLUTELY FEEL LIKE CRYING!  ( INSPIRATION4 WAS AND IS BEYOND BEAUTIFUL AND BEYOND EXTRAORDINARY) THANK YOU SO VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY MUCH MR. MUSK.   I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL AND THANKFUL.  I LOVE YOU ELON. I LOVE MR. ESPARZA AND ALL OF MY BEAUTIFUL FRIENDS.  🙏  SINCERELY PETER
Congratulations, awesome launch
こんなに当たり前になるなんてすごすぎる
Utterly amazing how routine this has become. Once this level of routine happens with Starship space exploration is going to get crazy!
Beautiful images
Congratulations SpaceX nailed it yet again 👍🏻
Just amazing!😀🚀🛰
👍🏼 Watching via SpaceX Starlink, as usual! Best  coverage to date: countdown, shockwave, second stage engine "breathing" and glowing, landing cam split screen! All awesome! 😎✌🏼
Great job!!!!!
太稳了～！！！
it's unreal how routine these launches are getting..
…sorry SPACEX, missed the livestream - my NEWSMAX show jus’ ended! 😕 - Tony [Anthony Aaron]
That was expensively boring
Hey, Jessy! It's always awesome to watch those rockets, best to hear it narrated by you, you rock!
That booster landing continues to amaze me!! This landing especially, because you can clearly see how the atmosphere gets thicker and thicker. It makes you think about how tiny it actually is, because you'll see the darkness of space from about 12km and up, but below it's thick enough to still see somewhat of a blue sky.
Amazing, great seeing rocket launches becoming such a normal thing now.
I would love to see SpaceX place some powerful lights on starship during its orbital launch so we could see it when it's over the USA in the evenings... Like a literal beacon of hope for humanity. Please upvote so this idea makes it to Elon.
If all goes well then SpaceX may launch 70+ missions in one year  ..  Then next year maybe 80+  ...  Then next year maybe 90+ ...  Then after that may become first aerospace company to fly orbital class rocket 100 times and reuse it's first stage booster 100 times  ...   Exciting times ahead !!!
A M A Z I N G
Thanks for putting more space junk into LEO, what a accident waiting to happen...
Man I love watching those landings!
i want to see starship launch like this
insane cadence
Another beautiful landing!
Landing legs deployed at the last second it seemed!
We are living in the future.
I think SpaceX could use one or two side fuel tanks to get the rocket back to land directly, no need to use a drone ship at all. just a small enough side fuel tank. and, no need to drop it either, land with it and reuse all. however, they wouldn't "waste" time on this kind a tech, since F9 will be retired, StarShip will be the only one after all.
Thanks, SpaceX, for regular extraordinary. The only thing that could make these great booster landing shots better is another camera on the opposite side of the booster so we can see the drone barge in waiting for a longer time. And a barge camera pointed up.
I love how casual they make it seem now
OK, now it is slowly getting old.

I AM WAITING FOR SpaceX first Spaceliner to launch
like it’s nothing.
Are they launching daily?
I was at Disney world when it happened but I didn't see it though.
Your launch cadence has no chill, great job Spacex team.
Designed rocket in highschool :)

I just watched this on the news abc from Brevard  county... i live in polk.... it was  so breath-taking...you all are àwesome and thanks for including me via youtube *)
We won't know how many Elon babies there are for this launch until April of next year.
Why is the ground camera out of focus? I have always wondered about this.
Excellent landing coverage, runs like clockwork. Congrats on the successful launch.
Merhaba  Türkiye spacex vasıtasıyla gönderdiği uyduların başarılı olması beni spacex ve ekibine dahada yakınlaştırıyo sizlere minnettarım 14 yaşındaki bir erkek çocuğu olarak kendi ülkemizdeki alamadığımız destekleri ve hevesleri bize verdiniz teşekkürler sizi çok seviyoru   Maddi imkanlar kapısı beni durdurmayacak ve inşalah yakında iş birlikleri vs birliktede ćalışma imkanı buluruz
I wonder if/how SpaceX can optimize their F9 launches & landings even further, with the data each new mission gives them? Any room for improvements?
🎉
This is amazing!
Today's fact: The meat industry contributes most to the increase in global warming every year. Deforestation is second. Around 68% plants are likely to become extinct.
Great job as usual spaceX.. haven’t seen another country attempt to do the same..
One thing I'm missing is the hour long livestream after the launch, so you can see where it orbits. Especially if there's a live view as well
Proud to be one of the first 1k comments which will soon be like 500k
Hey, no more video cutoff while landing. Now the feed is transmitted through Starlink? Vibration resistant?
Why not begin recovering the 2nd stages?
Cool
yeeaaah full landing video 👍👍
It's sooo cool to actually see the booster land! Did they fix the signal stability issue? What changed?
The booster kinda landed fast, I thought it failed but damn it slowed down quick enough.
Nice one spaceX!
dude tht was awesome
thank for watching!
Rocket go brrrrr
Man, this stuff is amazing!
Finally the landing video didn't cut out
First
I was watching from the KSC visitor complex, amazing roar of the Starlink!
Thanks for sharing. Never gets old.🚀🚀🚀👍
Extremely outstanding just how casual this has become.
i love spacex
W mission
3rd

15:24 yes, no interruption on either side of split screen. One of the best landing/touchdown ever.
ok
That descent couldn't have gone better, beautiful.
First
Thanks!
