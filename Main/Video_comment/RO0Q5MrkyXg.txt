Funny seeing Joe straight flexxin
It's nice seeing Derek helping out smaller creator's like Joe Rogan.

Did they have a debate on finasteride or any other hair loss treatments? Joe has made some factually inaccurate statements about finasteride and DHT, and this could be an opportunity for Derek to tell people the truth.

When Derek turned the camera I thought he was trolling, Joe looked like a madame Tousseau Doll lmao
Yessss! You made it Derrick! Top of the world! 😆
Derek looks so happy
Why is the podcast not on youtube? I cant view spotify. This is bs
Oh boy i sure wish spotify wasn such a piece of shit service and actually had podcasts in my country
Sick!
Did Derek ban more dishes more bishes???
This one was REALLY good.
Can’t believe Derek believed Joe Rogans excuse for his HGH gut.
Love you
Jeff bezos natty or not
kind of disappointed in this podcast. You have so much knowledge that I was wanting to see for myself and understand, but joes rant kind of suppressed that.
Joe is just mirim this supra physiological being of lean deltoid mass
Just watched the Joe Rogan podcast you were in. Awesome show. Super funny at times. For some reason I thought you were in Toronto.
Crazy you are up there with Rogan. You deserve it. You saved me and thousands of others many health problems. I discovered you when I was researching an oxandralone only cycle. Lmao. 2 years later I'm  still natural. But whenever I do my first cycle, I now will atleast know what I'm doing. Thanks Derek
LETS FUCKIN GOOOO
nice dude
Disappointing
10,000th comment. I checked ;)
Well deserve

Joe Rogan is not worthy of your channel...
Derek do the Ed Norton American history x transformation natty or not .
You made me teary eyed this morning..... so fucking proud of you
Since the Rogan podcast you’ve nearly doubled in subscribers that is insane
RIP
where are you bro i miss u. ❤️❤️❤️🥵
2 weeks with no videos. I do not approve
Bro everyday my gym routine was my post workout meal and watching your videos where you at man ?
Yo where you been man? Two weeks without an upload..hope you’re enjoying your vacation
This made my week 😆
Bro goes on rogan then disappears. He's officially been kidnapped by the illuminati.
Is he ever coming back?
Can you do a Natty or not about Mark Ruffalo’s transformation for Hulk and what you think the Hulk’s stack is?
Congrats pretty big meeting. No homo I love joe too he's great
Why didn't you pull your boulders out on Joe's show? He called you small
UPDATE: Joe drained all the testosterone in Derek's shoulders and threw him into a cave. Derek is now rebuilding his shoulder mass so that he can climb out.
I came back to this video wonder where the hell is Derek it’s been 2 weeks !!
After the podcast Joe murdered Derek
I for one am happy you're taking a break. After all, your next real break is at 2M subs you god damned machine.
USADA sent a cease and desist letter to Derek after the podcast
Where tf are you Derek upset face times two!
1 million man 👑
we love you derek!!! biggest fan ❤️ watching this for the 10th time! ps please bang my girlfriend
Where tf is Derek?!?
I heard Derek got covid
Derek took a fat break. He hasn’t posted in a long time, for Derek at least.
Brah where you at? Did the UFC mafia put out a hit on you? Awaiting new material.
You should make a video on increasing testosterone naturally!
bro where the new content. you muted by youtube or what. that insta shutdown mustve put you on silo watch
Spotify shuts me off everytime i go to watch jre. Also I don't use a VPN
BRO WHERE U AT
Did joe rogan kill him??
Do a video on Conor McGregor gaining 34 pounds
Well, guess fame got him, hes gone. I bet New video in a month saying hes boxing lex fridman
Joe could’ve gotten so much more out of Derek imo..
Cover Kim Jong Kuks latest doping test. He uploaded on his channel. That man needs proper justice.
This must have meant you were right about Joe Rogan on that old video. I think that’s how I started watching this channel. It started off with Jon jones then joe rogan maybe lol
Where has derek been? Hes been mia since this podcast.
Where you at Derick? Ive been watching this clip twice a day everyday for 2 weeks.
Just listened. Well done Derek! However, I feel Joe wasted the opportunity a bit... Derek is a wealth of scientific knowledge and the interview could have been so interesting and informative for his audience, but Joe just wanted to talk about poop, pee and UFC... 🤷🏻‍♂ No scientific deep dives into the deployment of supraphysiological hormones?! WTH?!
What is it with all you people complaining that he's still not uploading? Jesus let the guy rest will you
Happy to see him taking a longer break from YouTube.
Joe killed this man.
What 's up with his content... There's been 2 weeks now
bruh where did derick go
I think the reason it took this long to hit a million is because this is most likely the channel that hit a million subs with the most loyal and diehard/informed listeners out there. There are other channels like Leos, steves, I’d say even huberman that have crazy high quality information in many different areas and some of the same. But as far as the pharmacological/endocrine information…mpmd did it first and did it best. I’m so proud of you Derek as a listener/fan/student/customer for years I couldn’t be more thrilled. Big daddy delts is finally getting the recognition he deserves.
He's gone AWOL since this video. I think he did DMT with Joe Rogan.
Bro how have you not even reviewed Miles Garrett
Derek is taking a small vacation after hitting a million. Dude needs it
Has Joe Rogan kidnapped you or something?
Where the fuck is Derek?
I like how he got his million subs then quit
Hey could you guys like this so that Derek could answer?  Hey Derek. When it comes to passing on genes, and athletic/muscle building potential; is it static? Or can the thresholds/potentials of what you pass on change with extreme amounts of training, and PED use? Do you pass on the "learning" of building muscle mass? Excuse me if my question is badly formed. Thanks!
The collab I've been waiting for!!! Hahh hopping on Spotify now!
open a store in europe and youll make bank costs like $200 for shipping and import tull
Prediction! Since we havn't heard from you since this, i predict you are in Turkey getting your fixed!
You go mia bro? Where you at lol
Yo man I'm not sure if you will see this or bother to respond but I heard George Lockhart who is a combat sports nutritionist say it was impossible to lose fat and put on muscle at the same time. I have to disagree. I lost 100lbs by lifting weights and dieting and I put on a lot of muscle. Had never lifted weights before in my life. When I started I couldn't bench 170 and now I can push 250 for 10 reps. I started at 300lbs and got down to 180. All of this took place within a year. No supplements at all. All my nutrients come from my diet. Is he full of shit or am I a genetic exception?
I did my first cycle. 175mg of test a week. Was 12 weeks. I'm 3 months post and haven't lost any strength or very minimal is that normal or was my test probably fake?
No uploads in 2 weeks. I miss my new delt lord videos to watch!
The psyched substance guy has lost his family because of his roid rage, oh wait he's only doing "TRT"  hahahaha
Jesus is the truth reach out if you feel empty or like you have nothing left, he’ll accept you no matter who you are or what you’ve done
Jesus is the truth
I miss the daily uploads, although, if it is only a break then it's a deserved one.
Yo bro we the people need our nitric please restock soon
Hope dude is taking  a good long mental holiday. wouldn't even care if hes on haitus for a month or 2. been on the grind for so long gotta have a nice break. Respect
Get on Rogan then abandon your audience. No post in 2 weeks
You okay ??? You’ve been missing
Beast
Review chu gummies please
Well it's been 2 weeks? Hope you are ok
jesus. what happened. he went joe rogan and forgot about his youtube channel? 3 weeks ago man. where the vids at man

Damn it's been a while

Why does joe Rogan look like an old ass grandpa in this thumbnail?!  I cannot unsee it.
Bruuuu where are you it's been 12 days
Hey Derek please do a video on Ephedrine 🙏🏼
i need help.  I have been working out for a while now, and i have been having thse weird feelings. in some positions my arm veins start to feel pumped, like no exercise at all. am resting, ready to sleep in my bed and my arm veins start to bulge out, and the onl way the veins unpump is to chnge my arm position. it feels like they get blocked quicly in certain positions. I this perhaps colestherol? i whey 75 kilos and am 1.80 meters but i think my fat percentage isnt that high for me to have the veins "clogged". I dont know...am seriously thinking about asking my doctor.
Do Conor mcgregor bulking to 190
108K likes and 509 dislikes lol
Hi derek, is there any way where i don't have to pay £25 for shipping? It's extremely expensive and for someone who isn't financially equipped its kinda making me avoid picking up your products. :/
No New videos for 12 days???
Rip Derek
Roe jogan
How have you not done Aaron donald
Hi derec ! Does a anavar not open bottle ( expiratory date is may 2019) is safe to use ? I heard it is but it will not but ass powerful as it is suppose to be .
Derek is taking a supraphysiological break after achieving Joe Rogan Podcast
Whoaaaa look it’s Roe Jogan!!!!
I just found out I was unsubscribed from your channel.  I've resubbed, but you might want to check to see if yt is manipulating growth, or whatever happens that they cut people off from you.
Can i ask you what pulse oximeter do you use?
You dead bro?
Petition for Derek to change his legal name to delt-imus prime
Bro we need gorilla mind stock in the U.K. I wanna buy some stuff but the shipping is hurting my feelings.

Dude you havent uploaded a video for like 2 weeks .....Are you still alive ?
I love Derek so much seeing him smiling makes my heart melt :,) god bless you king 🙏🏻😌
Hey Derek, is there any guide line that one can follow, to read about nutrients, cycles?
Bruh he hit a million subs and then dipped
Awesome podcast!
We can see you Jamie👀
I thought this was fake lol
Derek go on the real body building podcast.
Come back from your little break already
I've been eating an extra plate at dinner every day for a year and i still haven't got any dates i don't understand what im doing wrong.
Damn Derek your shizzle is blowing up. Well deserved 👏
Woooooooooooow lets gooooo
Damn he has 1 mil now that’s awsome
Beast
Joe Rogan steroid cycle coming up :p
Hm
My estimations tell me that we will have reached 2 million by October 2022. Let's get it!
Already approaching 1.1 million subs. 2 million next let's get it!
my man went into hibernation :(
You should get Dana White and Joe Rogan in the same room to see if it’s the same person. It’s like the Rock and Deayne Jonston, they are both very popular look very similar but you never see them in the same room. Might be the same person. You never know
Where banana
React to daddy tren on tiktok pls
ITS BEEN 10 DAYS. DID HE DIE?
Is eggnog good for post workout?
Might just be the camera angle but you looking like rammy next to joe flexing 😂🤣💪 can only see ya head and tips of the delts
Bruh where are the new vids
Nice looking studio I would work there for free that would be so cool!
We miss you derek
Killed it on Rogan 💪. I've been waiting for you two to get together.
Did Joe Rogan eat you?
Conor McGregor 190LBS lets talk about it!
What I've Learned just came out with a new video about protein. React?
The podcast we all been wanting to see:) Congratulations Derek and congratulations to Joe for having this stud on your show🔥One of the best podcast I've seen and honestly my favorite episode. Fucking awesome chemistry and awesome episode all around👍🔥🙏
You did a great job bro 💪💪💪
Sweet
Derek i hope you see this, but there's new drama going around. Remember Adam? Well he's going through a lot rignt now and people are exploding the comment section mentioning your name and saying TRT caused it, saying he abuses it, saying he started going downhill after meeting up with you for pod casts.. i think people are out of their minds to come to such conclusions with no edvidence but it's going on. Wanted to tell you, maybe make a video on it and try to contact Adam. Poor guy.
I just realized it means lifting plates, I thought this was a cooking channel.
Hell yeah Derek!! Btw the tape you want for your mouth is 3M nexcare durable cloth tape for gauze and splints. It’s what James Nestor recommends in “breathe”. Works for my beard through the entire night and has been a game changer for morning energy. Thanks!
Duuuuude no way man! You fucking did it!!!!!!!!!! Hard work and big delts can get you far!!
That's the first time ive seen jamie
👏👏👏🧨
Derek can you please analyze and give your opinion on Charles Oliveira? I've got a strong feeling he is on some sort of PEDs. From a good, but not great fighter he suddenly becomes a power puncher, with great chin and cardio. His fight with Porier was suspicious.
Algorithm bump
Finding Derek's channel 4 months ago really helped me get my shit back on track. Idk the guy at all but love him and appreciate him like a brother.
Awsome!
It was quite a surprise. I actually opened spotify
Do you play games derek ? Im just wondering
I wish u guys had a recurring segment
I'd love to see the subscriber/nonsubscriber interaction ratio on this vid. You've got a supraphysiological amount of dedicated subscribers. Much respect/love.
Need to make a video on nick cannons gyno on his new movie misfits
I thought I'd never see the day. Congrats bro!
How good is 475 on a straight bar deadlift in freshman year of high school

Two of the realest dudes together. Love the podcast.
Conquest Complete.
Help beef patty some stupid person is stealing her content and putting it up on YouTube.
this is sooo awesome to see two great people meet and talk to  each other
Jokos new pre disect video ?
i would love to see a video about drug use in Strongmen competition
it’s so weird not having MULTIPLE mpmd videos to watch a day, which is a testament to how much time derek has put into this channel. he deserves all the love he’s been getting AND this much needed break from recording his own videos.
I'm telling everyone that you take steroids
Where’s Derek,no video for a week?
derek we love how far youve come, and we love you and you deserve all the good coming your way
LFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh mighty Delt vader, what art thou thoughts on mcgregor's weight gaineth?
Derek please do a video on the new mcgregor pics, I'm pretty sure he's juicing hard
Is no one gonna talk about the ceiling?! So cool!
Why haven’t you uploaded in over a week? Taking a break?
finally !
Yo Derek idk if you see this I’m a natural lifter I have a great head of hair I hoped on creatine for a few months but I have been super paranoid I’m decreasing the quality of my hair. Is it gonna cause any noticeable hair loss? and if it does can I reverse it’s affects with keto shampoo?
Studio Spoiler
That is some kinky shit bruh
Pierre Poilievre
Big Boy doing Big Things.
When u dropping more videos? I've gotten spoiled with multiple a day now nothing for the past week or so
That N**** on an Android!
Hey Derek you should do a video about Conor Mcgregors photos of him now at 190lbs. Is he on the sauce, or just getting fat? 🤔
Congrats Man! Huge to be on JRE!
MORE PLATES THAN DATES!
Toe Rogan.
good stuff, huge fan of both
Bro stopped uploading after jre
Where’s the new content?
GET SAMM HYDEEE ON THEREEE
it's awesome to see what what your channel has become! Gear nerd comin up in the world !
Yo Derek! Have you thought about covering Conor Mcgregors new transformation after his leg break? There’s some speculation going around that he hopped on Sauzule to speed his healing
Now I’m never getting any turkestrone..
Hey did you get stuck in Texas ? I'm starting to think Joe has you moved into the compound and wont let you go🤣🤣🤣
WAY TO GO BROTHAAA
Ayo what happened to the Instagram?
Why does Joe look like the penguins henchmen from Arkham City
train by day JR Podcast by night, all day
https://youtu.be/Cd44SMpa3tk
derek your honestly my hero
Loved it, hope you get back on Rogan again soon.
Whos this Joe Rogan guy? might have to look him up.
Derek bro it would be cool to see a fridge and gym tour from you.
Hey Derek. If you ever do a Pre Workout break down again, could you go through Seth Feroce Axe and Sledge line? Mainly, his one called 'Seventh Gear - Extreme Pre Workout'. I think it would be cool. Seth is a pretty straight forward guy too like yourself. Enjoy all that comes to you man!
Joe Rogan
Fuck yesss! You are one of my favorite youtubers keep it up man!! 💪🏻
Its so funny he tried to build suspense at first as if everyone doesn't recognize the red curtain
I knew this would happen as soon  as Schaub started talking about you
Woah what the fuck man hit a million? Last I even looked you were still at like 500k. Congrats dude.
EPIC
no way lol
Been watching you awhile. Happy to see something like this hit for you. I like Rogan alot as well, nice to see him bring you in.  Congratulations. This is a pretty prestigious jump in reality. Never thought it before but now More Plates More Dates is actually a pretty humorous tag. Noticing it going to MDMP fast haha. Kinda feel like one of my buddies struck luck. LOL.
did joe kill ths guy. where are the new vids?
Can you do a video on Conor updated body, a lot of people claiming steroids. I personally just think it’s a bit of fluff weight and lack of endurance training.
Derek please drop some merch, I wanna pre-order the pre-order
Im really happy for Derek on the success but Gorilla Mind will never be in stock again TT
Where is your Instagram
Why does something tell me if his IG account got deleted, this is yet again another example of double standards and another victim to the SJW movement.
like, fuck yeah, dude
Has Derek peaked and quit YouTube?
Did Derek's instagram get deleted?
WWWWWWWW Letsss goooo
Anyone know how to speed up muscle recovery and or soreness without gear. Been struggling with this for about 5-6 months. Whatever muscle group I hit is sore for a good 3+ days🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️trying to incorporate more triceps but It seems like twice a week is max unless I can help the soreness. Any reply would be appreciated
Does anyone know where Derek is? He hasn't posted videos in days.
God damn, 1hr - 1hr30 is just wasted time. Joe waffling on about people getting surgeries and then waffling on about some other shit about UFC and Derek really doesn't care. Derek noticeably bored and uncomfortable at this point. Hope it picks up again..!
So awesome
What happened to your Instagram man
Where did your instagram go ?
daaaaaaaaaaaamn that's Jamie!
I want to see a natty or not on Connor McGregor, I know he claimed natural and everybody else is on steroids but have you seen him lately
this dudes name is "More plates more dates"....the literal epitome of a meathead DBAG whos "success" relies on steroid abuse...SOME FUCKING HOW PEOPLE SUPPORT HIM WHAT HAS THIS WORLD COME TO LOOOOOL
No shit man! Joe damn Rogan. Can't wait.
for some reason I always thought Jamie was behind a glass window.
WHERE DID YOUR INSTAGRAM GO
congrats man
You guys are one sharp surgical blades . Amazing humans and super intelligent.  Uncle Joe is super awesome 👌  . Namaste 🙏
Has your Instagram been removed? Or have I been blocked because of Leo?
Incredible! Well done!
Congratulations Derek! You made it!
Hey Derek where's your Instagram
The crazy thing is that I'm subbed/have notifications on and I only saw this now, well after finding out you were on there from Greg's channel and subsequently watching it before this.  Congrats and awesome work Derek, much deserved.  This was an awesome podcast (listened to it twice).  * Imagine you don't get much constructive criticism, so heres one if you happen to ever check rando comments.  Don't worry so much about using thesaurus worthy words all the time/especially in a casual conversation (know it's part of your brand, but I guessing Rogan was probably a little tired of hearing efficacious/deleterious by the end, lol).
How small was he..? And could you rest your nuts on the top of his head if both of you was standing?
Derek has an android 💀
Where are u daddy and why's ur ig yeeted
Devon Larratt, juice or no juice?
You are a fucking god.
LETS GOO THIS IS HUGEEE
So what's up with GORILLA MIND shirts and apparel????
Great show! Really enjoyed that one
What did you say on JRE to make instagram ban you
Yoooooooo can’t wait
Hell yeah bout damn time
Why did you not call out Rogan for his head growing so large from HGH. Also.... is he really 5'8?  Tell us
You deserve it!
yesss we need this
Congrats that’s huge … joe is the man
Congrats man! you deserve it!
Fuck yeah Derek!!!!!!!
yo. wya Derek? world needs you rn
What happened to your Instagram Your Deltness?

Good for you man🤘dreams come true
Congrats on the podcast w Rogan! You make great and informative content. Good luck in the future!
Your the GOAT of the fitness community. You made it to Rogan ain’t nobody got anything on you.
No way

Bro

Holy shit.
Off topic milo sarcev gets owned 😄: https://youtu.be/YT9LRuSB2gk
That probably means you made it, right? It like being on TV back in the day.
Eff yeah, baby!
Anybody know what happened to the MorePlatesMoreDates Instagram Page????
Hey Derek, I think a video about Conor McGregor's recent mass gain would do well and be very interesting. He went from his foot being a balloon to his whole body being one. What do you think about his rapid growth while nursing a broken leg?
MR PLATES WHY DID YOUR INSTAGRAM GET ZAPPED
So....what happened to ur IG?
This is so overdue
Awesome 😎
Awesome!!!
Have you seen Nsima from Mark Bells' power project video on his before and after blood work from taking Fadogia Agrestis and Tongkat Ali? It made some pretty interesting changes it make for a good video of you giving your thoughts on his blood work results. Heres the link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdZh4kcP2L0
Awesome
Yo fyi your insta got deleted(?)
Where you gram go?
Whatever cycle he was on fucked his shit up face to the side n everything when he talk.
I can't find your insta account what happened
Yo what happened to your IG? It says user not found? Or is that just a bug
This is a primo meme template
derek can you review umzu and their testro-x / redwood
You said in the previous video that there are combinations of compounds you could take that would be equal to or better than taking tren. What mix or stack of compounds would you recommend as a safer alternative?
Let’s goooo
Can you make a video that says what blood test to ask for and only that you may have one I’m going to scroll after this
You're living the dream buddy!!!!
You gotta cover Conor Mcgregor.  The internet is losing their collective minds over recent photos. Lol
JOE BIDEN JOE BIDEN
Waiting on a video about Conor mcgregors latest pics… he’s definitely enhanced. Thoughts Please !
Damn from selling me sarms 5 years ago to the Joe Rogan podcast, amazing what one can achieve in such short amount of time. I honestly thought Joe Rogan was a wax figure and this was just going to be a funny short clip or something 😂
Is that Roe Jogan in the back?
Got to get them shoulders gains 💪
Sam is punching air rn
Woow. Congrats man
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Dude seriously F that old studio he had. What a disaster that was to look at.
Damn, good for you Derek. You blew up!

These Delts are going places! Luckily they brought Derek along too.
Amaziiing! 🥳
Best podcast in a while too 👍
Wow that's huge, good to hear :) -Shaye
EPIC!!!!!!!! Congrats bro thanks joe love it
JRE #1744 Derek from More Plates More Dates Runtime: 3 HRS 7 MINS So Derek's reaction video to the podcast should be close to the 11 hour mark! 😂 Can't wait! 🤗 Congrats on the 1st million subs! 🎂
I’m very proud of you, Derek. I’ve been following you back when you only had 20k subscribers. You’ve come a long way. Great job.
I remember when you had 20K subscribers you replied toy comments on every video. Congrats bro! You’re a great guy.
So Dope! Congrats bro

Fuck yes brother!!!
Seriously: this is the single BEST 1m special video idea ever.  Super creative and extremely satisfying as an outsider.  Congratulations.
Congrats! You deserve the success you have achieved.
I rarely comment but this is really dope. I remember when this channel was tiny. Well done!
Please start posting on rumble
Hey Derek, could you make a video on insomnia and the best methods/supplements to use to help with sleep. Thanks…

Great to see dude, nutty how fast your channel grew
The camper/planetarium look is a relief, glad Joe isn't broadcasting from inside of a Star Wars oven anymore.
He fucking did it!!!!!
Derek and Joe = Killer combo 💪👌
No wayyy
I am subscribed about 2 years on your youtube channel can't believe this happen! I will definitely check it out.
Fucking congrats dude!!! I couldn’t freaking believe it when I saw you on Rogan. Absolutely amazing
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
HELL YEA BABY!
I really enjoyed this podcast a lot up till you and joe started talking about women. Wow… I mean good for you to just say exactly what you want in a partner but honestly… hearing you say that you would prefer a partner that is not as successful as you so that they can support you better… ick…the thing is I know you are being truthful and it’s probably what alot of guys want But… wow… gross.
🙏🙏❤well deserved
Howdy! Just listened and watched the whole podcast and you Derek are a true gentleman and  quite informative and knowledgeable. I hope your visit to Texas was welcoming.
Just listened to the whole thing. Was fucking entertaining dude. Happy asf for u bro
Is Derek natty?
Just subscribed after seeing you on jre x
U should have mentioned Adam, I think he deserves to be on the podcast much more than anybody else.
DMT Derek more tren hmm🤔
Joe Rogan: Hey Derek, wanna come on the podcast? Derek: * deletes Joe Rogan steroid gut video * yeah sure thing
Happy for you. Your doing awesome. There's no limit to how far you can go. You only live once. So make the best of it!!!🏋️
Yo you should do a podcast with Rich from Entrepreneurs And Cars next
Finally got to see Jamie at the back there 😂💪
Derek interrupted too much, never added alot like we get to see him do on his channel. It started getting good last 30 min.
Wow!! 1M+ Congratulations Dereck!! I remember when I first suscribed there were around 15k suscribers. Long way since!!
I’m not gonna lie Derek you don’t know how to hold a conversation you kept saying “yeah” and rogan had to carry out the convo
amazing
I came here after hearing from you on the podcast
you are gonna talk with about HGH plomboism
I would love to see you guys talking about hair lol!
Seriously what was Joe thinking with that red space capsule room? Gave me claustrophobia just by watching.
you worked so hard for this !!
Finally! Knew this day would come
YOOOOOOOOOOO MIND BLOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Happy for you Derek. Great podcast. I wish more of the time was spent tapping your vast knowledge of TRT-related topics and overall health and fitness items, but it was good to see you just shoot the breeze with Joe. Great exposure for you as well. Cheers!

Great podcast! 🤘
Bro I've been watching your YT channel for a while love the content....but when I heard you were on rogan podcast couldn't wait to watch that episode...it's was amazing 👏...I enjoyed every moment 🙌
My guy is rocking a phone from 2004 with this video quality
Alright
About time! Good work :-)
lol wtf
big ol smile on my face after watching this
Epic crossover event
Fuck yea man
DEREKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
Good job mate, I remembering watching your videos over 3 years ago, and now you here! great achievement !
I wish I could be on joe Rogan. But I'm too average to become famous
How dare you disrespect Rogan
dude so proud of how far you’ve came bro!! congrats on 1m
Joe Rogan probably used to be 5.7 but years of too much hgh and trt along with bad diet choices made him 5.5
Good job bro! Also kind of cool to see the behind the scenes of Joe Rogan podcast.
Over 3 hours of the podcast but felt like less than an hour listening to you guys
Test levels doubled
Joe Rogan looks like he has a Joe Rogan mask on. WTF!
Congrats! :)
That’s awesome! Can’t wait!
Yo Derek when can we get gorilla mind in Vancouver
Proud supporter leave an algorithm comments In like every video. Pretty sweet for your publicity but kinda a bummer Joe’s a tool
1 mil clicks for a 30sec video
You are one of the few you tubers I could actually say that I'm truly happy for! Congrats Derek!!
Joe is a legend
wow from GLL to this, that's some wild 6 degrees of separation
LETSSS GOOOOOOO DEREKK
Holy crap
Legend
Dude,  Have you, or will you, ever do a breakdown on Cris Cyborg's supplement schedule? She honestly doesn't look like a woman. What is she taking?
Fuck YES!
One of the few Rogan eps I have watched and enjoyed in a while TBH. Reminded me of the old JRE days, seems a lot more political focused now with Joe's anti woke/anti covid/anti vax rants which I just find a bit boring and monotonous, although he obviously still tried to steer it in that direction at times.   Joe really seemed to genuinely enjoy your company, and I think you came across well, not over reaching where you didn't have domain specific knowledge and speaking with confidence where you did, in what I bet that must have been a pretty stressful experience. Good stuff.
Loved it! You had Joe In awe…. Can’t lie, I was in awe too.
DDUDE YES
Why are you there..U more woke than him
I hope he name drops pka or welcome to ban world
Can’t wait!!
One of my favorite episodes of the podcast
No way!!!!
Congratulations! Between the two of you no one can find vitamin d or derminator 2's
Dude, congratulations man!!!
yessssssssssssssssssss
You killed it on the JRE. The 3 hrs flew by! Congrats! MPMD!
This is huge. But not as big as your delts.
The king of pharmacology and calling out BS being on the JRE platform is amazing for the lifting community as well as those who are unable to detect who’s natty and who is not. Doing the lord’s work Derek.
Just subscribed after your JRE podcast. Unfortunately hadn’t found you before, but I’m here now! 👊
Oh damn, I was hoping this day would come.
Hell yeah what an awesome surprise !
More plates more delts baby
Damn. Congrats buddy.
congratulations, great episode!!!
Wait , i thought jamies was like an AI like Jarvis.
HELL YEA BEEN WANTING THIS FOR SO LONG
At first, I thought you were pranking us with a cardboard of Joe over there behind you.
Great episode, great channel!
I live in Joe Rogan's head. It's uncanny.
Damn u had like 100k last year!
Yahhhhhhh. Congrads
Algorithm ✔️
Dude I’ve been fucking waiting for this collaboration! This is dope af
All hail Joe Rogan
LFGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
this is absolutely incredible i remember watching supraphysiological years back when he was just a random roider going on about dutasteride and minodixil and wearing tight sweaters trying to cold approach chicks. this can't be real
yeah! well done.
Joe is massive right wing grifter douche…unsubscribed.   Damn, you were one of the good ones.
Congratulations on 1 million and it's about time these Two Worlds Collide!!
What!!! This is crazy
I thought that was a cardboard cutout of Rogan until he moved. bahaha
cool of Joe to mess around
More than deserving of this
This is awesome ... congrats!
LETS FUCKIN GOOOOO
Finally
would you review testro-x by umzu? the creator claims a 1000+ ng/dl increase in his test and that seems like a lot
amazing
woww Insane lightning room and Joe Rogan nail it as always haha WIll fuckin enjoy this show !
WOOOO
Congrats on 1 mil and getting to be on JRE!
holy shit
Amazing congratulations well deserve
Do threedotcorey natty or not
Congrats
The # ucking 🐐's.....
Guy who hasn’t been without his shirt off in any of his photos because he looks nothing like he did when he was on tons of PEDs but is somehow an expert on it.  Nice avatar looking nothing like you actually do.  Prove it wrong fraud
Letsgoooo
The starts on the ceiling are awesome
Derek’s net worth just increased 1000%
NO FUCKING WAYYYYYYYYYYYYY
this is gonna be badass
. JRE IS DOGSHIT MOST OF THE TIME. GLAD YOURE DOING THIS
lfg

Dude this makes me so happy my two favorite people. Love this shit
SIIIIIICK
Omg! this will be wild
Kind of a perfect match  What a bro moment
watched the whole podcast soon as it came out. it might just be the most super physiological JRE podcast he's had yet <3
Derek can you do a video on whether it’s true or not your body puts on weight in the winter ? I realize I tend to put on a few extra pounds in the winter nothing major but it seems no matter how strict I am with my caloric deficit I still keep those pounds on until it begins to heat up again.
ONE OF US MADE IT YEAAAAAH
The big leagues now Derek boi
Listened to the podcast today and really enjoyed it, I didn’t understand half of the vocabulary but I could tell you guys had a good connection! Congrats on the 1 mill 🤙
Ggg
BRO. WHATS WRONG WITH ME. IM HERE GRINNING LIKE AN IDIOT. THIS IS SO FUCKING AMAZING. FINALLY MY DREAM COME TRUE. YOU DESERVE THIS DEREK. LETS GO 2 MIL
https://youtu.be/RubBzkZzpUA
Huge W!
Hahahahha idk Joe Rogan is just such a meme. He usually talks about really interesting topics but his videos are also so random and chaotic at times, I don't even know what is going on.
Fiiiiinnnaaaalllyyyyyyy
that's crazy dude
Joe looks like someone wearing a Joe Rogan Halloween mask.
Good podcast my man
Good for Derek!
THATS MY BOY
Yoooo
So awesome to see you make it
Wow, that's crazy.
Nice one man! Finally on jre! Hes mentioned u a bunch of times before! Happy to of subscribed before you blow up in subs again ! Good job dude!
Bro, you are friends with Joe Rogan! Simply amazing what you have done. Clear that he and you really got along and you’ll be back on his show again.
4doorsmorewhores
Awesome ...Never took steriods nor want to but I'm glad theirs an outlet of information to protect those who are using so that they don't mess themselves even worse, or even for medical reasons.  Joe Rogan always open to listen and have regular broish intellectual chats.
The fact this got a million views and is less than 30 seconds lol. Bet he wishes this was monetized now
So happy for you!! Congratulations!!
No way
Good on you man!
Happy for you mate.. much love from the UK
Just listened. Great show.
wow
Hell yeah! Podcast was dope too.
What an epic milestone.
Ha ha, this is BRILLIANT ! Derek looks like 10 Christmases came at once ! Coach Greg gotta accept the challenge !
this is awesome
Video itself almost got a million views, what a legend!!
Jaime!!!!
Are you CIA too? The media division right?
Was expecting a sauna tour for 1 mill, guess this will have to do it then.
Crazy to think Derrick had 200k subscribers a few months ago. Great job man
NO WAY
I don’t know who this Joe guy is but he has a huge future if MPMD is collaborating with him!
WOW AWESOME
Congrats, it was just a matter of time. 💪🏼
heck frickin' yes!
Congrats Derek! It gonna be awesome!
G-SUS 🦅💀🍰🌸
Let's goo
The prophecy has been fulfilled.
The Roe Jogan Experience. Congrats, dude.
Are you Canadian?
Boom
He made it brahs!
Might as well go all in! Gotta eat some elk and smoke some DMT 😂
Best F’n JRE episode hands F’n Down!!!!  You need to be a recurring guest more so than nearly anyone else. Felt like I was watching my two inner minds having a perfect conversation with myself - amazing chemistry 🧪 !!!
Well done Derek 👍
my man is progressing
NIIIIIICE!! "WHHOOOOOOO!!!"
Whaaat!? Bout time!
joeeeeeeee the maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnn
Good job man, all that hard-work adds up to where you are
Wow I always thought Jamie sat at the head of the table and not at a separate table. Who knew
Lets gooo
To bad joe just rambled the whole god damn time and only asked derek like 5 questions. Joe has been getting bad at that lately. Shut the f**k up Joe we want to listen to your guest.
Congrats D. Exciting to see someone as honest and hardworking as you, succeed. Well deserved.
Godamnn just finished watching it I wonder if you worked out here in Texas ?!!
Fucking legend
Good job man
YEAHHHHHHHH BUDYYT
Wow, Derek is such a great guy, always promoting less known channels.
Oooh yeah awesome man 🙌🙌🙌
Who is this guy?
BIG W. CONGRATS MAN
Broo you sounded like a teenager about to ask their crush out on a date. The nerves are reaaaal.
Mans is about to blowup good shit Derek !
Joe got the Rolls Royce ceiling
Illuminati
Bro… the show was amazing and I love you you didn’t get roped into commenting to much on politics and kept it classy. Definitely one of the most anticipated shows and it didn’t disappoint.
Heard about MPMD in gym circles but never looked it up. Been a Rogan fan for years so I was excited for this episode. Gotta say this Derek guy is definitely an expert in his niche. New fan here
lets go
Wow, jRE!
Lol, we’ve been asking for the JRE since I subbed at 50k.  Congrats bud!
KYLE LOVES YOUR ALGORITHM #RSK
Fuck yeah
do video about indian bodybuilder Raja ajith. love from India🇮🇳 😍❤
This is amazing! Congrats on all of your hard work and how much you've taught us over the years.
Wow man, Good for you! I've known you since you had around 100k subs and always used to think why you didn't have more, you made it!
Congrats Derek!
Yeahhhh !!!
So awesome
Plates for dates on Joe Rogan!! Congrats :)
Straight to the top - Next stop: The White House :D
RSK
Holy Shit...  I genuinely have not wanted a guest more on JRE more than you Derek.  Congrats brother, well deserved and looking forward to it.
You know you're on the right track and consuming quality info when your fav YouTube bro nails it!
That’s awesome dude 👏
You the man!
Congrats 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
So thats what the rest of the studio looks like. Cool.
Can you do a video on Conor’s updated physique
Yohhh that's amazing! 🔥🔥🔥
holy shit haha
your photoshop skills have improved tremendously bro nice
WHOAAAA
Great episode. Look at Joe!!!🏋️‍♀️👍🏼
Love this. So glad to see this man growing and getting recognised for it.
You know your doing good work when you get invited on to JRE.
Wild. Used to read your logs on the good looking loser forum with a bunch of pickup nobodies. You made it bruh. Would you mind passing the tren and maple syrup?
So please I hope you see this, start doing your research on me now and when i post my transformation, do a natty or not. See how wrong you are.
Congratulations. Hopefully your channel blows up more than it has.
I'm tired of you accusing people just because they look a certain way. I will be doing a one month and a two month transformation and I guarantee you're going to think I'm not natty and I want you to do all your research and say what you think so I could shut that shit down. Not everyone has shitty genetics. Not everyone needs steroids or all that shit
Cute
Bro!!! My man! Psyched!
Heybquick question when a freak comes out the woodworks and you question their natty status dont you think that could have negative effects? Not everyone's juicing bro and you doing the natty or not shit is like putting down the hard work people put in. Imagine you're natural with freak genetics and then some dude comes along saying your juicing. Were supposed to just "take it as a compliment" I think you need to stop with that shit.  Especially with people who are making a transformation and want to be an influencer or even a trainer.
Congratulations
I am dangerously weak. Years of addiction. Being poor with not the best nutrition.   But now I have my own house and I am getting back up after being homeless probably 300+ days in my young 26year life.    What can I take that will not change my mental state too much and can help me workout like a beast?
Damn! From GLL forum to Joe Rogan Podcast… Congrats Bro
Epic!!! "A workman is worthy of his wages"- somewhere in the Bible. Bro, all your hard work and integrity towards your audience with your content and products has gotten you this far. Big ups fo sho.
Listened to the whole podcast twice I still can’t believe you’re on there Derek!! Congratulations!! 🎉 Joe is my favorite podcast of all time you guys were awesome together the hours flew by
I ironically discovered you like 4 days before rogan. Weird how that works…or is it?! 🤔
Inspired gang, can’t wait to watch it
Wtf joe rogan got old all of a sudden???
cooooool
Dude u came a long way! So proud of u! Been following u for years! Just a couple meatheads trying to find our way! Lol wow! Awesome man!
Finalllyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Hey Joe! May I come onto your podcast? I confidently feel I have plenty of amazing topics to discuss, I know I need to be heard! Not only would I be a dream to meet and be in the same presence, but I also dream of how talking about specific experiences could majorly help plenty who are stuck in the cycle.
WTF???
I've always wondered what it looked like around the room since the 📷s faced a specific angle
Was waiting for this one.
That ceiling is awesome.
Congrats on the YT God-Status, you deltoid God
Wow both of my fathers and my mom Jamie
Hola
Whoa, Respect!
Just want to put a little algo boost.
Yoooo
Hey Derek could you please do Conor McGregor PED analysis? He has blown up to a HUGE size recently, just check out his recent Instagram photos. Please!
No way dude that’s dope
AHHHHHHHH SHIITTTT! THIS WILL BE LEGENDARY!!
yeah buddy!!!
Congrats BRO
my man
Hell yea man! Congratulations,so fucking happy for you man! You’ve made it!
Not that my comment matters, but I really enjoyed Derricks conversation on the Rohan experience.  He is a wealth of knowledge. Especially for a guy who’s on the gas.
Derrick has made it in life :P
Banger JRE episode
Again cheating happened with Arvind Spartacus  Derek check his latest Instagram video on yesterday sheru classic competition for pro card
THIS IS SO HUGE GRATS DEREK
Thought this was going to be a video about joe on roids
This is awesome. So happy for you :)
Holy f*#K!! The combined knowledge will be unmatched for centuries! 💪
congrats for the level up
That’s it, fam! You made it! Congrats!!
Well Done.
Congratssss
Literally the dream of many to be on the Joe rogan show. Will be a great show.
Finally happened
Congratulations Derek, you deserve it mate.
Do you talk about bubble guts?
congratulations bro.. awesome...Lets go for 2 Million now...
After listening the podcast I can’t imagine what a leap this means for you. Now that you have had that interview it could potentially make your business boom even more than it has since YouTube. I imagine if he likes your line of nootropics and supplements he can not Only potentially invest but advertise your products and get you much more outreach
DUDE YESSSSSSSS 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️!!!!!!!!! OMG YOUR CRAZY KNOWLEDGE ALONG WITH JOES CRAZY KNOWLEDGE?!?!! TELL ME WOULD ELON MUSK SAY "INTERESTING" IN A GENUINE WAY AS HE PETS HIS INVISIBLE BEARD??  OR WOULD ELON MUSK WATCH THESE TWO AND SAY " I TAUGHT MY SON X Æ A-12 ALL OF THIS WHEN HE WAS 3!!!"  AND BREAKS HIS TV BY THROWING THE REMOTE AT IT.........GUESS WE'LL SEE!!!  ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
He did it!!!
What jacket is that, that dereks wearing? Looks noice.
You did such a good job on the podcast bro. So proud.
What a beastly collaboration
2021 date, 2009 video quality
DOPEEEEEEEEE
Epic.
Omg
We made it
I am gonna do the pull up jamie
Oh my god! Well done dude
More plates more based.
Could listen to you guys chat shit for days
Straight to 2 million.
No way!
Let’s go Derek!!!
Wow. I didn't know Jamie was an actual person. He's so fast that I thought he was some sort of AI.
TRT hawk “made it.” Lmao this just goes to show you can go from the small YouTuber I was subbed to when he used to give honest info and real dosages and info about different cycles, to a dishonest TRT clinic peddler touting absolute nonsense about different dosages, what’s possible regarding results, and fake natties and now half truths natties for clout and profit.   Big mistake with the Soosh Insta post it shows you don’t look like you’ve ever lifted in your life now and it’s because you’re probably on TRT dosages. It lasts for a while but eventually supra-physiological mass will diminish even with TrT. Think I’m wrong? Look at the greats and even More lies more flies looks deflated now. You’ve become the Anakin Skywalker of YouTube fitness. You’re power and influence has grown but it cost you any honesty you had left and probably more than that, & you were supposed to be the chosen one what a shame.
Hell yeah man congrats
YEsssss been waiting for this to happen for ages!
Yo! He did it 🙌🏾
Idk why I always imagined Jaimie inside a booth or something. Lol
Amazing that he finds it weird when people straight away can tell that he's Canadian haha
Very cool meet n greet ...godspeed
Thank you for letting us finally see Jamie as well as the fact that he has a mullet.
I thought it was a Madame Tussauds figure 😆
Holy fuck
Fuck yeah 💪🏼
the poison dwarf.
Yooooo what is this a cross over episode!  Hahahaa
YES BRO!!
Rappers and certain type of people brag about having stars in the roof of there leased ass, salvaged titled ass, old ass fkn buckets and shit....Rogan got 'em in the roof of his studio.   ...LEVELZ.
Proud of you dude!!

Hey people I’m new to the gym stuff pretty much and I was wondering if it’s true that creatine contributes to hair loss I want the gains but I definitely don’t want to lose my hair is it true or not
Was so excited to see your name pop up on my new podcast list!! It was only a matter of time Joe brings you up often.
I am tooooootttalllyyy checking this out
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BEEN WAITING FOR THIS

I’ve been waiting my whole life for this

I really enjoyed the podcast, congrats man 💪
Derek knowledge and personality
I think Rogan hired Derek to be his personal dietitian and performance enhancing advisor. 🤩
Been waiting on this since Joe said he wanted to have you on
This feels like a fever dream I'm so happy for you watching your videos since sub 100k
Been waiting for this!!
It was great listening to it! Loved the part at 2:59:16 when you were speaking about doing podcasts just to do it and the primary focus being the business. And the strategy was to just do volume and let it take care of itself. Can only do that if youre genuine. Big respect Derek!
What a savage
Congrats, brother. 1M subs is definitely an achievement, and being on JRE is just icing on the cake.
Seeing the studio from any other angle makes it look like when you glitch into cutscene rooms in video games
This is the definition of awesome. 😂
I have supraphysiological amounts of joy running through my nuggets right now. Hell yeah dude.
no way!
Hard work pays off.
Another one for the algo
Sick
Awesome dude!
Congratulations Derek 😍
Sweet the more dates side of the channel.... wait  Fire emoji x10

Such a great guy Joe. I was such a fan of his character way before his podcasts. Always loved how strong and honest he always was and didn't take shit from anyone. I was so right about him that he is now the most influential personality online
No fucking way! Congrats bro, you deserve it
Too bad Joe Rogan is cringe

Also talk about Joe's fuckin HGH gut. Don't go the whole podcast and not bring it up, I want you to ask him about it directly now that you can finally ask one of these dudes in person.
Just finished the podcast. The longer it went the more I enjoyed it. It made me happy to hear that JR wants to do another one, because, regarding you, there is so much to speak about! Congrats
It was a great podcast! Well done
Joe rogan looks tiny
Happy for you  keep going  !!
Chad of Chads
HELL YES!
I've never seen so many positive comments, you have over a million genuine supporters. This made a lot of people's days just because they were so happy for you. Let that sink in, support like that can't be measured and is worth more than 10m+ casual subscribers. Well done man.
Still surreal, yet I always knew you’d make an Awesome guest on Joes show🎉🙏🤙
Congratulations well deserved

Wings of Redemption is 2 people separated from Joe Rogan
About Time!!!  Prepare for lift-off, Derek.   Stay humble!!
Congrats! Hard work paying off
Would love to see a video of you talking about Connor McGregors physique change over the past couple months.
Oh my fucking god
Congrats. Great things happen to solid content providing people
It was a great podcast, congrats and thanks for all the great content!
That's what's up brother
Winning big time
Let's fucking go!  Amazing job Derek, this is a testament to your hard work, knowledge, and honesty.
Damn, I have never seen Young Jaime's desk, mind blown.
Haha. Epic.
Congrats dude!!
This is the first time the Joe Rogan podcast has reached super physiological levels
Congrats bro! I did a double take when I saw this episode in my Spotify recs. That’s amazing.
THIS IS MERELY A DISTRACTION! RELEASE THE SAUNA CUT !
So happy for you man...you deserve this
Congrats man, it must feel strange at least
So awesome!!!
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Shit yes!
awesome!
Woooo! Yeah baby! That's what I've been waiting for! That's what it's all about!
Was talking about the riding the bus to meet fat girls on tren/getting pegged on tren videos to a gym bro and then the podcast comes on that night 😂😂 it’s well deserved congratulations
Excellent work, sir!  You deserve it.
Good for you!  You've earned it!
no way!! thats awesome
Studio looks dope joe
Good shit bro
how are you that famous though?
For the win.
MPMD saved my hair and inspired me to start working out.   One year later, I have quit smoking cigs and have put on 20-25 lbs.   6'3" 210 lbs feeling the best I have in a long time.   Thanks for your insight and hard work Derek.   Also, your pre and nitric are the bomb.   Congrats, you deserve this man.
so proud of you derek!!!!
Congrats you deserve it quality content and you're far from a shitty person!
That’s dope
First time I actually can see his studio clearly
Joe doesn't look natural. Make a video on him.
This podcast was so EPIC !! loved it man!
Absolute legend. You've come so far bro 🍻
Natty Or Not on McGregor?
My mans
What a great 3 hours! Loved it
Invite Sam Seder on
Congrats!!
Boom 💣, drop the 🎤 - well done 👍🏻
Get a phone from the 21st century!
Very well deserved.
Hell yeah. Congratulations man. Excellent episode.
Just my interpretation, but I feel like you were bored of Joe's conversation at quite a few points? Maybe?  I know Joe's not dumb, but he also loves his bro science & talks just for the sake of talking a lot of the time, & that there was SO much more interesting topics more in your wheelhouse that you couldn't even get close to discussing because of his waffling.  Congrats anyway bro, & hopefully you can get back on to spread that supraphysiological knowledge far into the algosphere
Congrats on 1 mill
the first time I have seen the ceiling in that place. looks cool.
Fucking dope you got on with Joe. From where you started to where you are now is insane! Congrats on the success you beast!
HOLY SHIT IT HAPPENED!! CANT FUCKING WAIT!
So epic. Well deserved my man !
YOOOOOOOOOO THE MASHUP I NEVER KNEW I FUCKIN' NEEDED
I remember watching you when it was literally “more plates more dates”... congratulations Derek
Wow bro, I didn’t see this coming, congratulations
🙌
A great episode.
fuck yes
I am so excited
yikes :(
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Joe looks like he’s about 5’3”
Finally
Congrats and well deserved bro! Keep it up
My first time seeing the ceiling.  Now I know why people trip out when they see "shooting stars"
Holy shit!!!!!!
Great job Derek!
Wow. You made it brother. Congratulations.
He made it. The death star delts are getting everywhere I love it
This is the greatest crossover episode I never expected 😂
WHHHHHHAAT? That's awesome.
Hey Derek, love the content. This question relates to trt test levels. When one is on trt your levels stay more stabile elevated  then without and thus there is a benefit as you have stated even within normal T levels. I am wondering does this benefit come from a direct result of the higher levels leading to more muscle mass or even being more constant does this not lead to greater mass gains since it is still within normal range? Or is the benefit seen more through jus more stable energy levels which could theoretically lead to harder training and more gains? Thanks for your time and insight
Yooooooo
Outstanding podcast i was going bonkers when I saw you on theee
Killing it. Thank you for what you do. Lost 100 then put on 10 of lean muscle with your help. Appreciate ya

Hi been watching your channel for some time now, never commented for the "algorithms" soz, that's so amazing you've been on the JR podcast props to you my man. Amazing how articulate and clued up you are.
Legendary!!!
Congrats Derek! I’ve been watching your stuff a really long time and seeing you on Rogan made me genuinely happy for another persons success.   This maybe the 1st time actually in my life that I really, really honestly feel that. You if anybody deserve everything and anything good coming to your way. Great persona and in your videos the positivity inside of you shines through your voice and mannerisms.   Keep it up! Here’s for the future millions to come!

Congrats Derek, huge milestone I am sure for Joe to finally meet you. Seems like he was a bit awestruck by meeting you...:)
That’s awesome. Congrats Derek
1st time i saw Jamie. i think
This made me so happy. You have no idea bro. My mom died in October 2020, my dad in 2011, I'm 23 and man ever since my mom's death it's been agonizingly hard. I think I found your channel around that time last year, you for sure had less than 500k so I'm just saying for you to make this progress, meet Joe Rogan, it makes me so happy.
FUCK YES
I'm a big fan of both of you guys
Congrats! 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉
ONE STEP CLOSER TO PSYCHEDSUBSTANCE ON JOE ROGAN
Well I'm rocked up now...
Damn near shit myself when I saw the episode not knowing this was going to exist.
Well now every male in the age demo of 18-75 will be on TRT🤣💯⭐🔥🚀
Ayy, made it
Awesome
rogan is soooo fking pathetic
Well done
Yeahhh buddyyy
Ahahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!! DEREKKKKKKKKKK wtffffffff let’s go
congrats..awesome
Omg omg omg omg FINALLY!
Fak man! Such an amazing accomplishment. I subbed to your channel when you had ~ 200k followers. Congrats and continued success from Los Angeles Califas hermano.
Man, I tried to explain to my gf about mpmd and how huge it is he’s on rogan. I don’t think she quite got it but damn when I saw the clips pop up on my YouTube I was like “yessssss Derek made it!” I think we all agree he deserves the platform. Keep it rolling Derek!
holy shit
You should do another video on Conor McGregor now that he bulked up to 190 lbs. He looks quite a bit different now, I’m definitely wondering what your thoughts on his recent transformation are.
couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
More delts plz
Couldn’t be happier for you. You put in the time and gave us so much great content over the years. It’s easy to be happy for someone who works that hard for so long.
Dude. You're famous.
Awesome episode!
best podcast ever
Your face reminds me of regan grimes
So dope! Listened to the pod when it dropped on Friday, saw Rogan live on Saturday, bout to listen again for anything I missed while furiously doing delt flies and lat raises
Such a good episode, was so hyped when I saw it was out
Derek was never my friend.     -Dana White

Keep doing what You do and don't ever change man and I'll be a lifelong fan and customer 💯💪🏻🦍🧠💡

Kyle wants your algorithm strong.
God this is so sick!
Congratulations 👏 Derek
Joe acting like someone who's never been in front of a camera before lmao
:0
Hell yeah brother!
It was a great episode! Great job Derek!
Derek: “Hey guys taking a quick breather from the ol’ YouTube, should have a video for you tho.”  The video:
Your channel will take some awesome leaps and bounds after being on rogan! I've been hoping he was going to have you on for so long! He's always referencing your channel so it's about time! So awesome! Congrats Derek!
holy shitttttt congratulations
dude its crazy how many people just love for being the bro everyone needed
Lets fucking go Derek!!
OH LORDDDDDDDDDDDDD
OH SHIT
HOLY SHIT
Day 2 of asking Derek to review Sean Nalewanyj’s pre workout and other supplements
Congrats so happy for you 😃
Called it!
no WAYYYYYYYYYYY
Lol Spotify better pay you for the amount of trials and accounts being opened just to hear you talk to rogan. In all the time he’s been on Spotify I never listened to him, but now is a reason to I guess.
Killed it bro!!!
Can you do a natty or not on helmut strebl? I wanna believe there is a way he is natty tbh
I’m so happy right now
Great episode! Supraphisological dose of adjectives my dude 💪🇨🇦
I'm so hyped Joe rogan was the whole reason I got into fitness thus finding more plates more dates and a hand full of other genuine fitness content creators. Congrats man can't wait to smoke a fat one and watch the podcast
As Ronnie Coleman would say: “yeeeeeeaah buddy!”
We did it guys! WE got Derek to JRE! 😂 But on a serious note, the solid info presented in a no nonsense manner, backed by the time put into meticulously researching the concepts and topics covered is why I watch and "rewatch" mpmd vids. And seeing the community back Derek so is pretty sweet. Glad to be a part of it. Congratulations Derek!
Great podcast probably going to listen twice!
This is crazy and amazing
Pretty disappointed in the direction Joe steered the conversation. Everytime you started to get into good info he would go off on some random tangent.
Your fans are so stoked for you DEREK! Awesome!!!
Awesome
Holy shit congratulations!
So humble if someone deserves to be on Joe's podcast it's definitely you congrats
fuck yea!
Dude totally wasn’t expecting this.  Big props to you Derek.
Hell yeah! Legit happiness for this bro, well done
You’ve made it to the Mecca of the bros
I was ecstatic to see you and Rogan talk. I hope you two will circle back for round two some time.
Awesome.  Well done.
This is awesome!! I’ve been waiting for this!!
Congrats on the recognition. You should do an Onome Egger natty or not
Cool, you went to Fuddruckers!
Made it to the big time now.
Hahaha this is class!
HUGE
jaundice joe
Amazing
great episode of jre.  one of my favorites as of lately.

Supraphysiological gain in subscribers loading.
Dope ASF!  Just now seeing this... Major congrats.  You've been a big deal, but JOE ROGAN?! DOPE SHIT BRO!!!
Congrats
Good job budda!
It feels like a friend or older brother seeing Joe.   Lots of road already taken, much more to cover.
Oh snap!! 💯😱🤙🏼Hanging out with Joe Rogan. I'm losing my mind over this🤣
holy shit it actually happened!
YEESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
My boy Derek went straight Goodwill Hunting on Rogan!   Proud of ya!!!!

buzzed for you mate, congrats and 1000% well deserved - long time coming
Don’t forget to test the DMT
Holy Effin Sheet.
Kyle wants your algorithm strong
HOLY SHIT
That’s awesome!!
Dude where did you get that jacket?
Probably the dumbest podcast I have ever listened to. Talks about how women are supposedly getting surgery for men. Didn't push back against rogan's completely stupid vaccine stance. Have some self respect for yourself.
red panty night!
Awesome you deserve it.
Aren't you the big shot we all knew it was coming you're the best man
MPMD and Joe Rogan are my two of favorite podcasts, along with High Intensity Health.  Congratulations on 1 Million Subscribers. You regularly provide really useful information and what I find especially refreshing is your honesty and integrity about the relative usefulness and necessity or lack of necessity of certain supplements. The Bodybuilding Supplement industry is still infused with the manipulative and deceptive tactics that Joe Weider and Weider Enterprises established in the industry. The so called Godfather of Bodybuilding was objectively a complete and total scam artist sucking the dollars out of aspiring bodybuilders by promoting severe over training and useless garbage weight gain powders. Fortunately there is more useful information now than when Joe Weider was scamming the average bodybuilder.
Knew it was only a matter of time. Grats bruh bruh.
I called it
Kyle wants your algorithm strong. And congratz Derik!
dude you know how to celebrate. Congrats and well deserved Derek!
That’s so awesome to see was waiting for the day. Can’t wait to see how much subscribers you’ll get now
My 2 favourite people together
SHIIIIEEEEEEET
Congratulations man, you’ve earned it

Can't believe Roe Jogan invited the delt lord to be on his podcast. Crying laughing emoji *3
Now this is a crossover the universe needs.
That’s so fucking awesome
QUESTION, why are your eyes red in most videos, are you high out of your mind to deal with the cringe reddit posts or is it something else?
About time 💪💪
LET'S GO BOYS
My two favorites on one podcast.   Great appearance.  I’m guessing 2m followers is right around the corner.
I need to see those legs Derek. I got questions man... Lol I got questions.
Bucket list ✅ congrats to a normal guy getting after it👍👍
📈📈📈📈📈 ALGOBOOST
YOUNG JAMIE IN THE BACKGROUND
I feel like I saw a bunch of stuff I wasn't supposed to see lol!
Ewww why is this in my fees
Wow
I found your channel when you made the “Palomboism” video about Joe. This full circle thing is so rad. (It was a great episode too btw)
Derek about to go from 1M to 2M in the next week... Lmao.  As a pharmacist, I'm impressed with the amount of shit he's learned on his own... Solid effin work!
WOW what a huge accomplishment and great job with 3 plus hour interview. Can’t wait to see your recap video of the experience.
So happy for you dude, playing in the big league now

Congratulations you made it 👏

BROO, BEEN SO COOL TO SEE YOU GROW OVER THE YEARS, FUHHHKYEHHH DUDE
Matthew 7:13 You can enter God’s Kingdom only through the narrow gate. The highway to hell is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way.
let's fuckin go Derek
Not gonna lie, thought Joe was a wax figure until he yelled out.
Man. My fiancé and I have been watching your videos since you had 60k. Seeing you at 1 million now is awesome. Keep it up!
holy shiit i couldn't believe it 😂😎💪💪 congrats mate
Thats INSANE
Holy shit!
Joe Rogan:  "Dude.  If chimps were everywhere and they had full freedom the way people do, we'd have a FUCKING SERIOUS PROBLEM.  It would be chaaoosss, you wouldn't be able to leave your house. If there was as many chimps as there were people you would never be able to get to your car.  They would mug you every chance they got. They would rip your fucking feet off, and f**k your a**.  If you don't think chimps will steal babies and eat them, you haven't been paying attention to the literature.  Crazy 800-pound silverback BURSTING through the tree.  OAAAHHHH  OAAAAHHHH  OAAAAHH  OAAAH OAAAH OAHHH  Samoan babies that can run fast, I mean that's what's gonna survive.  Fuckin diesel, diesel square headed destroying machine. Fast, twitch muscle fiber angst.  And finally his life has become special after years of neglect.  OOOAAH  OAAAH"   Derek: 🗿
Great podcast!  PLEASE DO A NATTY OR NOT ON CONOR MCGREGOR

Holy shit brah
WOW. Congrats mate
Good podcast very surprised actually lol

Respond to kyle
Took derek 90 seconds on the pod to say disproportionately 😂
Maaaaaa boiiiiii he did it!!!!!
Yeah Buddy
joe hitting a front double bicep is hilarious.
Damn right Derek. You da man home!!!
Oh my god it finally happened
Fucking awsome dude‼️
They need to get More Dishes More Bishes on next, the real reason we watch these videos.
And here I was thinking "If Derek doesn't do a full sauna tour for his 1 mil subs video I'm unsubbing" but HOLY SHIT was I wrong. How do you sub to a channel 10 times? Asking for a friend.
This is so hype.
DAMN DEREK
By far one of the best episodes ever ! Congrats on the success man ! I been watching you since you first videos man.
Perfect format for your long winded ass lmao  Fr congrats dude. I love your content and I'm halfway thru the pod and it's fire
Definitely one of my favorite episodes!  Great stuff man!
This is badass! Found your channel from Joe Rogan a few months ago when he recommended it!
Derek is about to get a super-physiological boost in subscribers.
Supraphysiological Levels of Proud!!! *hundred emoji* *hundred emoji* *raised fist emoji*
I really celebrated this event! Enjoyed the podcast a lot... Harrassed my girlfriend the entire day saying: "DEREK MADE IT TO JOE ROGAAAAN!!". She got quite annoyed after hearing the same story for like 15 times yesterday. But it was damn worth it <3
The crossover I've been waiting for 😝🤟
„THE most epic crossover of our time.“- NYT
TRENDING
Fucking amazing man you did it
I dont like how there's so much chit chat on joe rogan. He gets some of the top talents and most knowledgeable in the world on different interesting subjects, and everytime he talks about mma and weird people on the internet, like plastic people.
Duuuuuude Joe Rogan is on More Plates More Dates?!!!  Good for you Joe!
Yeah man, fucking right ! Happy for you
Noyce!
I was pumped to see you went on Rogan. Two open minded intellectuals having open dialogue👌🏻
Wow what a great video, this inspired me to keep working hard and believe in what I create. Who's ever reading this I hope your goals also work out. - Tom's Audio Show

Watching Derek grow from the bottom. Makes me realise that anything is possible.
our master joe rogan
WOO BOIIII
Congrats man! This is so impressive and innovative for a 1 million sub video! My fav podcaster and BroScience expert in one video! Not many ppl will I watch a 3 hr video on but this will be one of them!
Yoooooo
You can't handle the position you're in regarding the 'fame' (yeah we could maybe use I different word here. let's just digress) and 'influence'. Many can't. Joey bag o Hogan's can't. Your politicashitbags can't The Queen of frickin england can't. But that doesn't allow you 15 minutes to have all the 15 year old boys hanging off your jock. You'll wind up worse than that schmuck Jordy peterson. I am Lucifer. Get out of my way. And we will chat more later.
OH SHIT
Crazy
bro i swear i first started watching your channel when you had 40 thousand subs now youre on joe fuckin rogan!!! you deserve it man cheers!!!

Derek looking Alpha as fuck!!!!!!!  Yes bro, delighted for you.
This is the only interview I’d sign up for Spotify for. Big respect.
Can't wait
Can I just say how composed and precise Derek was on this interview. I feel as a long term watcher of his channel he had to chase Joe’s train of thought too many times
I've never been this happy for a guy I've never even met
It’s for the algorithm

why does joe hogan look like death? is he okay?
Just need the 80's style  action movie tie in. Two  wise cracking, TRT supplementing podcasters go undercover with navy seals to rescue Elon Musk who is stuck on a faulty orbiting SpaceX Starship toilet which is going to ignominiously flush him into the vacuum space in next 90 or so minutes causing humanity to lose all hope in the process.....
Derek is really gonna make us wait till 10 mill for the full sauna tour isnt he?
I'm so happy for you.
Yeah!!!!!! So fkin excited!!!!! Congrats

I love you content and have learned alot and I appreciate the hard work and effort you put in! From a big fan in east Tennessee 👊🏼 thanks brother
cant wait to watch this one
Congratulations man. I've been following you pretty much since the beginning. This is awesome.
WELL DESERVED . nuff said
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him! "Go and sin no more."-Jesus
So happy for you dude!
Man been watching you since the beginning and man you couldn’t have done it any better
Rogan's a moronic dbag. Still happy for you tho lol

LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO
Grinning ear-to-ear. Obviously the episode went well. I saw the clip on JohnJones. Good analysis. Too many people give John a pass, including Rogan and the UFC testing folks of course. I get why Rogan doesn't destroy John to some degree, but definitely isn't completely honest about Jones either.
He invited you so you would stop exposing him !
YEAAHHHHHHH THE BOYZZZ!!!
Damn man
Started from the bottom now we here!
Proud of you dude, this is huge!
Saw/listened to it this AM, was like “yo boy made it” congrats dude
This is huge
Bigggg day for Derek !!!! I’ve been watching you grow for a long time now and I can’t believe what you’ve achieved 🚀
No fucking way... that's a greenscreen.
More money than brains.
Yo Derek! I heard you talking about your sleep apnea and possible deviated septum. I am not qualified but I believe those are actually symptoms of a poorly formed jaw.   Basically the food of modernity is too soft so when we are growing up there isn't enough stress placed on the facial muscles (and orthodontics recess the mandible) so the muscles form down and back into the throat. I think you have some sort of malocclusion (I do too) of the jaw, which is also a cause of teeth grinding.  Some resources I've turned to to learn about this is the YouTube Page "Jaw Hacks" and the book "Jaws: The Story of a Hidden Epidemic" by Sandra Kahn and Paul Erlich
Awesome! Congrats man🍻
25 on trending gets gooo
Wtf no way fuckkk
Duuuude this is so surreal! But amazing!

You have reached such a top tier that very few people do.  I knew you from the GLL days, and you still remain humble and chill AF.  Congrats on your top tier success Derek, keep crushing it in life.
Hell Yes!
WOOOOOOO
Algo comment for Derek 🥲
You can feel the testosterone.
This is amazing man! Watching it right now and loving it! Forsure gotta see another JRE with you
Congratulations my man!!!🎉💪🏿
Lets goooooooo
Algorithm!!!
love your fucking name buddy!
This man deserves every ounce of success he’s achieved.  He’s such an inspiration to me💯
Damn!
My boy leveling up, about time!
Lets goo Derek
95% of the time I feel annoyed by others' success, not bc of jealousy but bc I'm a borderline sociopath & want my life to be the only one on an upward trajectory.  That being said, THIS makes me LEGITIMATELY happy. As a man in my early 30s, I wish I had a big brother/role model like Derek to guide me from ages 16-21. It would have saved me a ton of brain damage from listening to moron gym bros, anxiety over trivial issues & I'd have made infinitely more progress on my physique.   It's clear Derek actually cares about helping the young guys, seeing as he's always preaching truth (even if it's unpopular) about protecting your health, why steroids aren't smart most of the time, why its important to become good w/women so you can move on & focus on the important things like building a successful business & family, etc.   That's why even a sociopath like me feels a real sense of pride watching Derek on JRE, especially after all the years of hard work 👏👏👏  Congrats Derek, here's to the next 1M subs brother👍👍👍🙂🙂🙂
Haven't listened to Rogan at all since he moved over to Spotify.. Guess I'm going to have to cave in now.
Holy shit!
LET'S GO
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO
Yesssss!!
Congratulations bro
Leeeeet’s goooooo boys!!! A shot for every “super physiological” & “efficacious dose” said. See you on the other side🥴💀
Congratulations 🎉!!!!!!!

Proud of you Derek
Awesome!

Hell yeah bro!!
This is fucking crazy because i was wondering when derek was gonna be on joe rogan like 15 minutes ago
Finally my boy
I hope you tried out elk before you set this up
Top ten bodybuilding-pop culture crossovers
Awesome
Congratulations, Best way to bring in 1 million!

Omg!!! Yessss
Was an awesome podcast. Joe is a great guy. Gtfo of Canada and become a regular
Woo... Ow yeah!
Holy shit Joe Rogan got to meet Derek
Thanks to Derek, we get to see the more of the new studio….Joe having rolls Royce star lights is so Joe Rogan
Supraphysiologically GOATed
I thought that I had seen my last full episode of Joe Rogan's podcast since the spotify move corresponded with him getting whackier but I guess not. It's going to be a huge disappointment if he doesn't recommend eating elk meat and doing saunas.
LMAO BRO a couple days ago I was thinking about when you were going to go on JRE and lo and behold it happened!
holy crap happy for you, congrats
Damn
YESSSS FINALLY I AM SO FUCKING HYPE

Wow...going to check it out .. i stopped watching Joe .. gonna check this one out👍👍
Congrats Derek!!!
WOW
Bro that episode was so good.  I haven’t skipped more than 5 Rogan episodes since I started listening a few years back because my job is super boring, but this one was awesome.  You really opened his eyes to the reality of doping.  I loved your bravery in speaking out against the obesity positive movement as someone who was over 300 pounds just fat for all of highschool and got my shit together with help of forums back in 2010 to learn how to eat and train and eventually sauce.  That episode is going to catch so many new eyes on your channel that may potentially save their lives from premature death after hearing your content.  Best of luck to your growth man, 1 million more!
Duuuuude!  That’s amazing, hella big flex 💪🏼
Hell yeah man hell yeah
Lit.

You were kind of shy and a bit awkward but your content was so fresh and you were brutally honest not just about the industry but yourself too.  Well, here you are. You deserve all of the success you've had and more, Derek!
For a moment there i thought the thumbnail was shopped 😱

Please tell Joe Rogan all his favorite fighters or on gear.

Wooooooooooooowww yess
Heck yes dude!  Can’t wait to listen!
Oh shit
Fuck yea brother! Bout time
Yeaaaaaaa
More plates more dates more joe rogan!
Rogan is a halfwit sometimes….and sometimes I can’t stand to hear his arguments and perspectives but damn he really is the best, so I still give him the respect he deserves and suffer through whatever I disagree with him about, and even if I hated the entire episode or podcast I know I at least came away with more knowledge than before I came into it with.  Derek on the other hand is always a satisfying super physiological cycle of delts and Humbleness run concurrently with a minuscule dose of intelligence that seems to have the adverse reaction of itching my anus that I just love to scratch by making sure to catch every video he puts out
Will be interesting to see how much subs Derek gets from this podcast to see how much influence Rogan has. Yesterday I was wondereing why I got no MPMD notifications, was getting worried. First JRE episode I'll hear in my life!
He fucking made it
Bro that’s Fuckn awedomeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrr

Imagine if Coach Greg was there too.
Congrats, bro!
Your smile says it all brother.  Congratulations!!!!  You absolutely deserve it!!
Superphysiological ...
YEAH BOY!
LETS FUCKIN GOOO
Carbon isotope ratio test is to determine age of something. The ratio changes over time and we have the ability to detect that change. Anything carbon based created in your body will have a “new ratio” profile. As it ages it changes and becomes “old.” This is true for all of them. This test then determines the age of the testosterone in your body. More time from production to use indicates storage. All external sources of test will be “old” as there is nothing you could do to reduce that production to use time to the period in which a person could use it
Congratulations. Great job! Very cool

Congratulations, well deserved.
Wow, that’s awesome man. Couldn’t have happened to a better person. Congrats!!!
Derek has officially made it
Let me explain you how nice, charismatic and insightful Derek is. I am a woman in my 30ties. I don't take any PEDs never will cuz I am not not interested in them, don't need them. I am also into women, so not here to get excited over his delts or sth 😅 I have NO REASON to watch More Plates More Dates as the only thing we have in common is love of sport and interest in bio chemisty. But Derek is so knowledgeable, funny,  fair and respectful guy that I became a fan instantly and been watching him for years. I learned a ton of things, some are of direct use to my sport and recovery regiment, others are information I will never need, but the bottom line is - a good youtuber doesn't need a gimmick to get an audience. He can just be a nice guy sitting in his sauna, who just takes the time to prepare high quality, informative, insightful, well presented and entertaining video. And personality shines though his content too. It is not hard to spot how nice of a person he is outside of the youtube world. The way he talks about stuff is never arrogant or hateful even when he disagrees and that says a lot.  Well done Derek and good luck 👍
This will be my first Bro Jogan episode in a long while
Yasss, looking forward for this
Umm like like umm like like umm I'm on like Joe Rogan like umm
First time iv ever seen Jamie.
Congrats Delt Lord! 🔥
Im so hype!
wow! You are about to blow up!
Congrats my guy !!! Couldn’t be more deserving! Get it !!
