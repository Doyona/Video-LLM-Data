How in the hell is anderson still bowling so quick at his age
Jimmy I love man
Jimmy, great bowler in any part of the world now
2:55 what that mf is saying???🤨
Hi
Highlights package includes singles!! Wow, not much of a highlight. Was a disgraceful performance. Lucky no one gets to see it on TV anymore!
Jofra archer ... ?
Congratulations Anderson for becoming no 1 test bowler
The day the legendary batsmen of all time from NZ Ross Taylor retired NZ couldn't able to win atleast 1 game. At one time it was strongest in the world beating any country. McCullum is coaching ENG...why can't Rosco coached for NZ team definitely NZ will reach their heights. Comeon Rosco i want you to coach NZ.
NZ did bad that game and will be hoping to get a better run in a few days
Indubitably this is the best Englih team in decades. And the thing to notice is that the team is comprised of the same players who were playing under Root's captaincy a couple of years ago. Just the change in mindset and here are the results! Thrashing Nzl at home with such dominance. 🔥
Why do the commentators want green wickets in India when the climate doesn’t allow the wicket to hold? It is pretty much like a bad workman fights with his own tools When you don’t know how to play spin, just blame the pitch and escape your failures and techniques to play spin. Indians never complain about pitches when they lose in sena countries. White people are always complaining, just can’t swallow their failures. Wants everything on their terms, colonialism have not died yet in their minds.
Still talking going on for indian pitch.... accept it folks y'll don't know how to play spin all in all. Spinning pitches are nothing to do with all this advantages, it's about your skills, temperament, courage of defence... who lacks it gets a nightmare about that quality spin
Jimmy is great test bowlers of all time
Dirrr
Dirrr
where is mike hesson  former nz coach
Bowling 135kph and he’s 40😮
These highlights are better than the previous ones
Day night cricket tests boring 😴
gareth southgate batted well..
Geez, there are so few highlights they need to show our guys picking up singles to get it to almost 6 minutes .... NZ cricket def on the decline
This Anderson lad is a prospect
Great , but could not watch the England cricket match because that would mean I have to also buy BT as well as bloody paying for sky , and the corrupt bbc licence ,(which I will be cancelling shortly as I don't watch live TV anymore ,, so although I won't be able to watch live cricket only stream it , its not going to make any difference anymore ,its all about control so f**k you rip off b**ches ,I will catch up some other way you parasites !!!!!
A pitch is decent when it is comfortable for white cricketers. Otherwise it's not good. They say as if after they bat on a spinning track the Indians go and bat on another pitch. What piece of jokers
Thank you for producing this highlights package. You were scraping the barrel for things to put in as there wasn't much of the game left. Instead of seeing singles could you have replayed the wickets, or even shown Ben foakes taking a ball whilst stood up to Anderson?
On another note have bt sport deleted their india vs australia highlights? I can't find them anywhere
well done Brits....love from New York.
In my opinion, at no point nz looked as tho they wanted to win🤦
Mitchell looks like a good batsmen! Shame the other Kiwis didnt do well but Broad was on fire yesterday.
Jimmy, Jimmy Anderson is going to past the legend, Shane Warne Test wickets of 708 during this summer‘s (2023) Ashes. I wonder which Australian is going to be his 709? Surely he has to do this achievement, it is written in the stars to do it in the Ashes. I only wish the legend Shane Warne was alive to see you this achievement, and both Jimmy & Shane could have a beer together.🍻🍻🍻 RIP Shane 🌟 . Jimmy Jimmy Anderson, you’re a unbelievable legend 🌟🌟and you’re 40 years of age and still playing.🍻🍻🍻
To have any chance in the ashes , they need a good finger spinner
Daryl Mitchell is a very good player
Was that 8 wickets to fall to balls either hitting or would have hit the stumps?  And with Broad bowling that is a big surprise.
BT Sport is a joke. Shouldn't be allowed anywhere near cricket
England best team in cricket
Another magnificent Test performance. England are just a delight in all forms of the game imho!
Broad needs to take a long hard look in the mirror. Englands most expensive bowler in the second innings.
Show the DRS!
Sir James Anderson....take a bow!
India v England 5 match test series home&away should be a fascinating series
Two real GOAT 🐐, jimmy and broad
Watching Jimmy is like an old master at work, very few seamers get to this age and still perform brilliant. The likes of Hadlee and late Malcom Marshall come to mind.
Stokes racks up 12 wins as captain this being the 10th in 11 matches and sixth in a row. A 267 run win all done by the first session of Day Four. Stokes and McCallum are just intent on entertaining people with great cricket but seem to be winning at the same time! I suspect the Aussies won't be so arrogant come the summer given their thrashing in India and how England beat India last year by 7 wickets.
Well done padding out the video with anything you could find around the wickets
Wish that trumpet player would go away
I've waited 15 years for this win in New Zealand about "bloody" time well played lads. What a special team this is🤣😃
Crap highlights
Again, badly put together highlights and consistency. Whoever is responsible needs to get another job. Well played England - otherwise you would not know they were really untouchable in this test.
A word of advice to the channel. When an umpires decision gets reviewed it is customary to show the damn review!  Muppets
We may lose the odd match playing like this, but we wont lose a series, we are witnessing Test cricket being turned on its head, England will dominate Test cricket until the other nations decide to follow suit.  I love it
Could have highlighted the wicket replays rather than random singles?
This is an underrated achievement from England. To win a test  in New Zealand, regardless of how their form has been recently, has been something we haven’t done for 15 years. Like the Pakistan series, we are doing things we haven’t done in a long, long time. Also Jimmy is the classiest bowler in the world at the moment, a master at his craft at 40 years old!
Feel a bit sorry for Broad that Anderson came in and took away his five for.
These highlights are weird, editing needs to be more thoughtful
Barely even a test for England.
Not sure the Anderson/Broad combo will ever be beaten in terms of wickets taken.
The highlights were that bad they decided they needed to show singles to get it above 5 minutes 😂😂
Bazball is taking England to new heights. Let's see how they will be successful in India and Australia
Jimmys career average now into the 25s.  7 wickets in the match at 7s.  At 40 yo……..Absolute machine!
Bring on the Aussies...were on fire
When they show singles in the highlights, you know it was over quickly.
England are unstoppable at the moment. Australia will be quaking in there boots after there shameful display against India today! 😆
Great win lads 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
3:10 139kph? Anderson can still ramp it up! 💥
I don't understand that why other countries are always blaming Indian team for pitches? I think they don't know the phrase called 'HOME ADVANTAGE'. Every team does that, if india loses in SA/NZ they say well played. When they can't beat us in home they say doctored pitches. There are two types of bowling in cricket, SEAM and SPIN. You can't call yourself great while scoring against seam and getting trolled in spin. Double standards........😂 Also, well played Anderson and broad.
interesting to see how these players would fare against england. yes ik taylor is retired etc  guptill will young fin allen taylor neesham degrandhomme jamieson boult henry fergueson
Kiwi's put to the sword on their home turf 👍 😁
If indians lose their first test at home, they will prepare turner and spin friendly pitch in the next test 🙄 🤔
4 for 18 with economy rate of 1.71 p/o at 40 years old, between him and Broad 8 wickets for 67 runs. He may be closing his career but those figures, any bowler would be happy with.
40 years old and bowling 140
What weird hightlights! Why show the singles but no replays of wickets etc
Ohhhhhh Jimmy Jimmy!!!
Not by the barest of margins
Where was BT Sport’s evening highlights show? These tests are played overnight in the UK so English supporters in the main don’t get to watch much cricket.
Pathetic performance from NZ non competitive
Brilliant work lads, did not miss a ball and it was worth every minute. Loving the new attitudes, keep it motoring and keep playing the fluid game it's working very well.
“Home pitch bully” that’s all I hear about Anderson! Over 250 wickets abroad now though 🤣🤣
Kiwis krushed
Jimmy Anderson is my all time favourite bowler & he also plays for my team Lancashire.4-18 of 10.3 overs.He's so economical.I think he could carry on for 2-3 more yrs tbh.If he can avoid injuries.Butlers my favourite batsman also Lancashire.🏏
Come on NZC, give us a longer highlights please!
Quiet reminder that Jimmy Anderson is 40 years old. Absolute legend of the game
wow at this age Jimmy Anderson bowling speed  is between 134 to 139 . What a great bowler .  playing a swing at this speed is really tough. I always been his fan even he performed always against india.
Poor performance from NZ
NZ need Jamieson and Boult desperately.
Around this time 20 years ago, Anderson was playing in the 2003 World Cup. 20 years later, he is still here.
