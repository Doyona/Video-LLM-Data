I've been using these apps for few years now and highly recommend.. so far I've claimed back a total of £1363 :) Checkoutsmart £720, Shopmium £333, GreenJinn £192, Quidco Clicksnap £98, Topcashback Instore £20. Warning though, make sure you retrieve your balances regularly. There use to be an app call Shopitize which went bust few years ago and people lost hundreds of pounds as they had cashback still in their account! Apart from that, all the apps have been amazing and got to try so many things I never knew existed! :D
I'm Italian and after seeing the way you cooked the gnocchi I was screaming
Might be blind but what is your referral code for shopmium. ?
1. I would have loved to see you take the pringles, blend them with a little water and use in the sandwich XD 2. Not enough vegan options in London???? 3. Gnocchi is normally put into boiling water, and it's cooked as soon as they start to float 4. Alpro yogurts are soya ;)  Please do a video eating only supermarket, restaurant and cafe ''waste'' (products that expire that day or they have too much of) :)
What  was the referal code  for shop mom. .I am on android and I can't use apple  link...thanks
Just to let u know for next time kfc chips aren’t suitable for vegetarians/ pescatarians

Where’s the Nando’s and McDonald’s I watched this video for😤
Anyone in Ireland know apps like the ones he used in this video?
Pringles and toast look so good 🤤
Death to the Coronavirus!
This is so cool. Thanks for sharing. I like Pringle’s
Y didnt he just have toast on have the pringles as a snack
It’s very disingenuous the photo to this video is literally Nando’s, M&S, Pret etc but you didn’t get a single thing from there.
You live in west London possibly somewhere close to Perivale or hangar lane
Where do you get your stock footage from
I rewatch Ben's videos all they are so professional this man needs an award for his editing 👏
Why does this guy look and sound like he's sick of himself, AND sick of being a youtuber?
5:32 this hurts (I'm Italian). By the way great video as always Ben, you are soooooo underrated!
I used both apps for my weekly shopping today and thanks to you for making us discover it bc i save £5 😅
Hi Morris.  I just want to say thx for bringing your content to YouTube. You are part of the reason started youtube and have 7 video out . So thx for being there for us
what car do you have?
I missed this video for a week, so this time i decide to subscribe to this channel 👍👍👍
I don’t enjoy many YouTube videos but yours are insane 🙂😀
Can we talk about the quality camera
bro this guys videos are so underrated
Please don’t make gnocchi in this way again. You should cook them like pasta. Boil the water and cook it in the boiled water 😭😭
Free food but you have to have money in the first place to buy it
Hi Ben, I love watching your videos and I'm very inspired by them. I would like to recommend you to create a user on the free app Friendspire. It's rather new and is for getting recommendations from friends and people you follow within categories on Food & Drinks, Movies, TV Shows, Books and Podcast. I think it would be a huge benefit for you especially with all your traveling, to be able to collect all your restaurant and bar recommendations on there. Then it is easier for us followers to quickly find your recommendations if we are in a city that you have visited earlier. It's very easy to use and free and I would love to follow you on there. You can also save things for later e.g. if you're planning a trip and finding restaurants and bars prior to going. Hope you will consider it! Have a lovely day 🤩
I'm surprised you didn't use TooGoodToGo after the last video
wiw
Did he just fry nochi?
Download postmates and use code IRDYGK on your first purchase for 100 bucks delivery credit. Enjoy :)
HI! anyone else that has been using shopmium? and would recommend it?
I dont know how you've never had a chip butty before
Do it without cashback app
I'm a student at the university of Hertfordshire, the student support there hacked my laptop and android phone and leaked it out to millions of people when I was just 20 years old, I'm now 22.  I wanna give this uni the negative image it deserves.
Dude, you need some meat, it will help your body. :)
Only took you 1 min 16 to explain what the vid is when we already know..   Nice one
Chips in a sandwich is called a chip butty 😂
Always a joy to see your videos Ben
Why does Ben eat an ungodly amount of sauce???
Me from the north thinking that anything on bread works 😂
You shouldn't of toasted the bread when having a crisp sandwhich or it will be dry!
what camera are you using ? or suggest for cinematic camera, Thank you  :)
Its call a chip buttie lol.. staple for kids in the UK growing up.. how have you never had one?!
That gnocchi transition though
most underrated youtuber
please can you do the customisation on the mini
Ben has the best content around
so underrated 🤩
Do you know why your phone is bugging by any chance?
I’ve always liked your videos Ben and have told people about your videos which I rarely do but for you to say there is a second spike has frustrated me really. There isn’t a second spike it just goes up and down in certain places and countries. Educate yourself first before you go around saying second spike because it makes you sound stupid
wtf since when did he live in ealing
Could do with cleaning those dirty greasy indicator storks on your BMW. 🤢🤮
Way better than jmx
How was the best free food in the video (subway) glossed over in 30 seconds and not really explained at all?
If you want extra credit feel free to use my code -  9b3c3v Reply with yours and ill use it :)
Your cats ugly
The way you pronounce gnocchi annoyed me
ahah that's my local tesco's
Go on the worlds shortest flight
posh boy can't eat a crisp butty
Those KFC fries are fried in the same oil as chicken so idk if you care but technically not vegetarian
Bro u say free food homeless people doesn’t have bank account
Bro, these videos are so good, don’t ever downgrade your content always put it out on YouTube cause we all love it!!!
Love your content came from your Ramadan video and stayed ever since!  Your effort really inspires me keep it up!, road to a million
Instead of completely cutting out meat and dairy you should’ve gotten tested to see if your body has reactions and should’ve seen a dermatologist!
Wow.
You could just eat Pringle alone and drink water. And done. Stomach full infact bloated. You wouldn’t need anything for 2 days. I Am lazy and do it all the time.
*Thanks for saving my food dept*
Anyone here from the trending Page?
You’ve never had a chip butty 😳😳😳😱
id love to smack this guy in the face, his nice, humble, vibe seems abit forced
When man didn’t butter the bread
French Fries Sandwich is literally my favorite snack :)
Loved the video man! Keep up to good work! :D
Are ben and millie dating?
millie ;)what did you have to do
I was waiting on this
Mans never had a chip butty before? Nah
why he’s orange
Was getting really confused as wasn't sure if you were saying three or free as you were saying free for both. Think it was meant to be 3 for free but it said free for free. Confusion
Eats mozzarella.  Eats yoghurt: 'I don't eat or drink dairy'. Ermmm you do realise mozzarella has dairy in it right?
This guy doesn’t miss
Not free, you paid money for a lot of the items before you claimed the money back thus claiming it be free......alot of people don't have money to do these offers in the first place so this was a bit of a fail
Referral code; si5d5p
Why do you drive a old bmw you used to have a better bmw
it's a shame that Alfie Deyes got so much hate for doing this video :/
Did he really just dip gnocchi in ketchup
congrats on trending again ben!! great that you've had the break you needed (hopefully managed to work more on bringing back postyouth) :)
I’m gonna try a challenge like this I think.... Love your videos mate 😍 love from Japan
NAHHH bro gnocchi and ketchup;()--------------------
@clickfortaz
Literally so funny watching this as an Aussie when i was  a kid i would always go down to the servo just to get white bread and smiths chips to eat in a sandwich and use leftover hot chips from my fish and chips to make a sandwich

Didnt you eat cheese? Thought you dont eat dairy?
I ate free LEON food boxes everyday for like 2 months. Still had at least 30 coupons left, but the promotion expired during the lockdown :(
The people you get food off have obusisly bought the food
500k🔥
Don’t really see the point, it’s living for free right? billions of people live like this every day, not for a week to film for a video. My friend, you call the video living for free but your driving around in a convertible man.
where’s the referral code?🤣
6:19 wtf
I 'accidentally' left my phone at Millie's house so I have to go back. Well played Ben. Well played.
Free food for 2 days but spend £20 on fuel travelling between collection points 😂
Crisp sandwiches bang though probably shouldn't have toasted the bread imo
9:58 free free?
To cook the gnocchi you have to put them in a pot with hot water, when they start to float it means that they are ready to eat.
Eating free food for 48 hours, in a convertible and in a nice London flat. I appreciate this though, you always have some great video ideas and this can be so helpful.
I love ur videos bro and i hope u succeed in life. Keep it up😀👍👍
Sad that basically all Things like this dont work in sweden...
He looks 16 but 18
Is Topcashback legit?
What’s the shopmium referral code
Where were you in Croatia?
if you download the costa app you can get £3 free store credit
Never had a chip butty, smh
That yogurt wasn't finished haha
Pizza Express gives free pizza
So without the app we cant do it then?so its clickbaiting then
Do a video about your daily routine
Great video but how have you never had a chip butty before😂
Why toast the bread?
Ben being tall makes the fridge in his friend's kitchen look tiny 😂 midget fridge
Mmmm water - the tastiest of all the sauces
U could have got more just eat  credit if u complied about the food mess 😂 works all the time
I have used Shoppium in the past during my first year of uni, the cashback is a bit slow and it is on a few of the others I’ve tried (names aren’t springing to mind, you will probably show others I’ve used) they’re good apps
did you film in mykonos and croatia?
Gnocchi in a pan nono 😅
Who else found Ben from JMX but now watches every vid
So hyped when he uploads
Most forgetful video I've ever seen lol...
Never had a chip butty. The most Tory thing I've heard in a while
loved the video but thought you should of done more than 48 hours, maybe tried the challenge for a week?
Well done on 500k that is such an amazing achievement halfway to a gold play button.
Simon Wilson style 😎
That transition at 5:29 🔥
Woohooo finallyyyy a vid is out🤝❤
Me living in Australia like 👁👄👁
love these free food videos!!!
bangers every time i- ☠️
You should have used mayonaise for your Pringle and the Fries Sandwiches .
So basically you have to pay for it and then the app gives you your money back?
pls make a video about being a deliveroo rider again and telling all the customers to subscribe to your youtube channel (it's a challenge though) LOVE U FROM THE PHILIPPINESSS ♥️♥️♥️
Anyone else sad it’s only in the UK 😣
4:33
“Never had fries on a sandwich”  I could’ve fainted when he said that😱😱😱
I love chip and  catchup sandwiches, as we call chips in the U. S. French fries. Love that since I was little and still love it.
Good slap in the face for Simon Wilson who lied with sob stories or steal to get free food
Ben did not cheat by using the source, as he’s only eating free food. And source aren’t food so it does count.
Absolutely smashing the content recently. Take the breaks when you need them man, cause burnout sucks
What’s the code
What does Ben do on a daily basis? Is he studying? Or he lives off of YouTube?
Quick hack: use the mccdonalds app over and over with different accounts for any hot drink (the accounts take 30 secs to make)
Congrats on 500k Ben! Absolutely love your content :)
Kfc chips aren’t pescatarian 🤨🤣
Easy my friend got to eat free food for 4 years in prison
Love your channel
plss do a house tour
Ben Morris has such a clean computer setup ngl bro wish mines was that clean!!! 👍🏻
I love this guy, ben mate come on my podcast.
Why do British people refer to regular ass paper as A4. Like bruh, it’s just paper 🤣🤣 idk kinda petty, but 🤷🏾‍♂️
sour cream and onion pringles + butter+ bread is godtier
Columbian cold
Ben Morris is so underrated he should have so much more subs than he has. If you read this Ben keep up the good work
Your cat is so beautiful what breed is that Ben? great video once again 🙂
Great video! Loved the transition!
You can use this referral code 'da67w4' for the shopmium referral code for the Pringles offer.
your videos are elite
"I think that was just my excuse not to got the gym, but we move" - Ben 2020
Is Ben and Millie dating?
How many times did you go to 🚽? 😀
I saved this video to watch when in bed at 11pm cause that's the best vibes to watch Ben's vids
Cheeky chip butty
The effort to go and actual get the receipt back 💯💯
here you dating flossie or olivia
Ben I think I saw you in Croatia a few weeks ago but I was to scared to talk to you was that you?
U ate meat? KFC fries are cooked in beef oil.
Disappointed that he didn’t scrape the yogurt pot out
Didnt realise so many apps with free food!
Why toast it!?
Providing the Sunday night entertainment once again.
He hit 500k subscribers! I'm so proud well done man
Literally all you do is complain...
Bens videos are actually bangersss
I love your videos normally and you always put in a lot of editing effort but this was pretty feeble ngl...
define satisfaction...    5:28
You forgot your receipt, then you forgot the receipt again, then you bought the wrong yoghurt, focus man wtf.
Ain't gonna lie I still have those muller yoghurts now
Could you do a about you vid? Give a bit of depth into your life, did you go to uni?
Why doesn’t he have more subs?
Hello
Innovative, ingenious, appreciated ✌️
Great video idea! However, every time you cook gnocchi like that an Italian dies :(
What's the referral code for the first lunk
I think cash back is technically cheating. It takes more than a day for the money to go into your account (sometimes it doesn’t even) So for that day you’ve spent “eating for free” you actually haven’t.
If butter was allowed, could have made himself a crisp sandwich! Would have been yummy for sure :)
Love your videos keep the good work.
Please upload often I love ur videos
Every ben morris video is downloaded cause of how good his editing is
banger! as always
doing this challenge is easy living in the UK it seems, not canada tho 😩😂
Use me as a button if you have watched this vid right after the champs leauge final
Caffe Nero, Greggs and Leon used to all have freebies when you signed up for their membership program/app.
Shopmium referral code is 5ra7au 👍
love the originality, really enjoyed this!!🤍
I love your videos! Greetings from Greece
You were on my flight back from Split!! But I was to shy to say hi haha 🤣 you also looked exhausted! Lol
Ben, your videos give me so much inspiration, and I urge you to keep making those vids. We all appreciate your out of the world editing and please, keep going with these vlogs, and challenges.   We love you!
lol pescatarian means diet consisting of vegetables in addition to fish/sea food not dairy 😅
Congrats on the 500k! Totally deserved
The king
u can get free glazed krispy kreme donut if you download the app or if its your birthday, pringles and donut?
Maybie do a ubereats video on a boris bike....
Didn’t realise you’re based in Ealing😂
Bayern vs psg who will win
Fun fact there are more planes in the sky than boats, crazy right
1:45 lol
Congrats on 500k ben!
The fuel of the car costed more than all the free food would cost lmaoo
Never had a chip butty, are you even English??
Pls tell me where you got your cat from 🥺🤘
Your a vegetarian not a peskatarian
Starbucks gives a free drink or food for your birthday too
That is the driest sandwich 😂😂😂. So glad you added sauce- I’ll say you aren’t cheating 😂😂
You should try to find unicorn food.  That would be so very cool. 🎂🍰🍡🍦🍧🍨🍩🍭🍬☕
Did anyone notice that most of his Videos are how to get free or cheap stuff?
PLEASE PLEASE DO A DAY IN THE LIFE also please tell us what you do to have such AMAZING hair lmao
Life is back on track now Ben is uploading
Congrats on 500k King 👊
People who are watching PSG vs Bayern rn
One of the most underrated you tubers. Keep up the good work Ben
Forgets receipt, uses sauce in his cupboard & picks up the wrong yoghurt. Typical Ben videos, and I love it.   Anyone else would just lie, and not show these things but Ben is truthful. Love how your videos have matured, and evolved man, keep up the great work.
Best youtuber in the game
What car you driving?
I lived of free food for 13 years       It's called being a child
Welcome back Ben another amazing video.Really think you need to get more sleep you look tired the whole way through.Stay safe Liam.
You should have paid for the water etc
These videos are so good and fun to watch 🏆
disrespecting the crisp sandwhich im disappointed
Ben is the most underrated YouTuber. He needs to be for known for is entertaining, original content.
Ben uploading at half time of Bayern vs psg is a blessing
I just have to say that over the past month I have absolutely binge watched ALL of your videos, and the amount of time and effort you put into each and every one of them is so worth it. The wait in-between each one isn't something I can complain about
Water isnt a sauce 😄
5:28 ngl that transition was clean
The alpro yogurt is soy not almond btw :)))
I’ve been waiting for this!
your such a great youtuber, love your channel ily ❤️
I now have 40£ on my bank account and no job, but I would probably die faster from eating this kind of food than not eating at all, nice video though ✌
You don't understand how glad I am that you just uploaded 😳
Such a real life channel and I find watching your videos really interesting
How have you never had a chip butty😧😂
This is just every day for a cannibal
"pringles on toast"
I lived of free food for 13 years       It's called being a child
Me trying to watch this normally.   My internet...   Stoopid im not gonna let u get the chance
Is that the Razer Deathadder elite on your Mac? If so, that's the same mouse as my one   cool video idea I look forward to finishing it
Ben can you do car videos on your second channle or something similar to that?
That sandwich 🥪 looked GRIM. Should have just eat them separately. Or used some butter instead of sauce
Great video
New whip?
hey !!
Who agrees that YouTube should show who disliked and liked a video to see all the haters and the normal people
You put so much effort into editing the videos, WOWWWWW
LOOVE IT
Love your bed love from india
Amazing video
