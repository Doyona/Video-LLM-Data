You need a leaf blowers so you can blow off all the loose snow over the motor on that thing your snow rail that's covered with snow on the motor a leaf blower will probably clean that off
Nice place.
Why are we watching people watch this thing go up the mountain. I wanted to watch the machine go up the hill. 🤦‍♂️
Roman Atwood is still Alive!
Loved this video and watching my YouTube gusy having a great experience 😮
We all can agree that Gavins 3 wealer is pretty cheeto.
Gotta love when HDsparks and Cleatus bring a group come together. Looked like a blast.  I had respect for these guys until heard @5:29 the crack on Westin Chaplin and then saw one of the Cboys (Ben?) @10:08 making another fat joke crack on Keton.   Just those two infantile asshat jokes ruined the whole video for me. Remaining respect for the Cboys =0 and Unsubbed.  I expected better from those guys.  So disappointed. I thought they had more class.  Mad respect for Keton and Westin for hangin tough.   And my hat if off to Cletus for sticking up for his bro's in his absence . That's a real friend and a standup guy.  Well done Sir!  "never meet your hero's"  is absolutely right.
All of yall + Travis Pastrana 😱
Man I tell ya, my family and I would love to do something like what you guys are doing. It looks like to much fun, as usual it seems like it's only something for the privileged and nothing us poor handicapped individuals like my family and myself could afford at all.
Just bought my tix to the Cleetus racing event in Indy on May 2,3 .... How Fun!
On this series you need to end with ' duke's of Hazzard them song  Epic
It's awesome watching you guys having fun on and in your tracked snow toys. My favorite part of this was seeing that beautiful Black Hawk flying and landing
At least the landing is soft compared to freestyle with a mega truck
Rewatching 2024 as 2025 is in cupped ! 🇺🇸🥃👊🏻🍻
Man there is nothing life with buds with  money
17:09 I think they forgot to cut out the drone hitting tree part😅
Rad❤
This is going to be awesome. Love seeing all the youtubers. I've been watching Bobby Layton mad off recovery. A bunch of you guys.
Bet yall won't go save Cali  and go put out the wild fires and help around
Cleet for president!  CLEETER 2025 !!   ❤    Cant wait for a blackhawk 500.. soon as cleets heliport is ready, you best beiieve blackhawks gonna be the new crown vics 😂
You are the best people MAKE the best video in the USA    I am a big fun of your channel
Great content
Love Shenanigans
silly ?where r all kids and wifes never see them
Cleetus the snow Travis pastrana😂😂
Why is Roman Atwood there?
The coolest collaboration we were waiting on
wheres dave
Its a bummer ya guys never got to ride with ken block.. you guys all would of had a great time.. PJ Baldwin is another great dude you guys would like too..
I’m just wondering how to become part of this friend group!! Badass!!
I wanna think from the comments on Cletus’s last video that the “incident that shall not be named” occurred during the time of these recordings. Something to do with a helicopter and a snowmobile from what I gather… I can see why they wouldn’t wanna post that for legal reasons. What happened is probably WAY to big of a legal (FAA) issue or looks very bad for someone’s image. Either way it will most likely never see the light of day.
5:32 cleetus: " that's my dawg"
Don't forget you guys wouldn't have nothing if it wasn't for the people that like you.
I'm surprised none of them smoke weed.
I would say it's probably Mr Sparks.
Which one of them own the cabin?
That's what it's all about is. having fun with all your money. Normal people can't do that. They don't understand that.
My girlfriend name is Palmer
It did look good to me
more of this!
going through themountains has got to be my favorite missions to fly
cgi
Freaking awesome!
And this is how YouTubers get killed ! 😭😭😆
I love all these snowed in videos!
Cool guys
Build a helicopter pad with stairs down.. loved the barge.
4:38 Why is bro getting so close w the camera 😭
Every toy except a hovercraft.
Please make this a yearly thing. I want to see this again with more people even.. this is awesome
I have served all my life, need a helping hand
Dave you're talking about a 1.9 mil bid on q helicopter.  All I have is a bag of coins on the dresser it's hard to watch you. Even though I love you.
Heavy D wires off 1.6 Mil while eating Tacos!!  Towing must bring in the Mo! 💰
My compliments on your love of Kässbohrer - Piston Bully. The PB400 is a nice machine. It looks as you have the "Park Bully" or "ParkPro" w/ you. My personal fav is the PB 600 Polar. Outstanding machine. As a 29 season SnowCat operator, I got a bit of chuckle w/ you messing w/ Cleetus and Cory . Your mtn getaway way adventure looks like a riot.  Happy travels.
Diit
When y’all do these multi part videos, I wish you would link them in the description
What site did he use to buy a blackhawk does anybody know???
Awesome video love it!  Lots of friggen fun
Where’s diesel Dave thou ?  Not seen him for a couple vids hope he’s good and well
O LA LA AMIGOS...ive played in the mud..sand...water...hay...pool..but u guys are something else GOD gave u life..the snow n forest and u got the snow mobils for you to play n have fun with...ur a bless people of da LORD..amen

Awesome. What a cool crew.
Robby! 😀
I have been having to watch videos about how to battle depression because when I watch your videos on your YouTube videos all I want to do is have fun like you guys do good I'm 60 years old broke as a joke on social security 900.00 a month is not a lot to live on but I do survive barely. How do you enjoy watching your videos on how much fun you guys have and I do live vicariously through you guys how are you guys up at the cabin and having fun I sure wish I could do that too. 😎🤠😎👍
Rest in Peace Ken ❤
So, can my make a wish be meeting and hanging out with yall? Im terrified of flying, but you make it seem fun!
This is absolutely amazing to see, heavy D, whole diesel crew ,whistling Diesel, Cletus and One dude was even like yo can we borrow the 2 million dollar chopper to go get Westin too 😂😂😂 ❤ I love the Adrenaline Brother hood !! Sign me up boys 🎉 I’ll send her in the top of 5th 😂 Do it For DALE !!!
Where is grind hard Plumbing at ?????
12 YouTubers die crashing into mountain in Blackhawk helicopter😢
That's what I need a man weekend like that
I would have liked to see your ripsaw in this clip
Did i just get clickbated?
Keep the tracks go over the pond at home
Imagine getting 1 life, and it's going THIS freaking well
I love snowed in!
DAVE!! WHY AREN'T YOU JOINING THE CONVOY AT THE BORDER??? USE YOUR PLATFORM TO HELP FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY!! I know you might say for the sake of your channel that you're staying out of politics, but your viewer base are already freedom motha lovin patriots that would agree. Also, it's not a political issue, it is for the politicians, but not for the American people. However, there are likely a lot of your subs that don't know what's going on. Probably the younger demo, the biggest target by the elites to indoctrinate, that could use an eye opener. Dude, you could unite with a lot of the other big channels in the diesel/auto category and make a real difference (whistling, JH, cleeter, CBOYS, etc.), think about it man, it would be huge. Your pansy Governor even went down there to support. Use your platform dude, let's make a difference, you have a sick fleet of trucks. You know you'll even make some money.
Cletus jumping that snow rail had me chubbed up. Not going to lie… I was rocking a 25% Chub on that cleeter
wow. what a dream to have a weekend like that and to have those type of toys. I love these videos!!!
This is a hundred times better then last year.
This is literally best thing out on YouTube so cool that you guys do these what an awesome experience it must be
Idk anything but $1.6mil for a Blackhawk seems like a STEAL! Why are people buying Bugattis and Paganis when they could have Blackhawks
1:38 167 Mph? That's pretty damn quick, wish I'd have a Blackhawk
Heavy D and Cboys collab? Hell yeah!
What a place the ultimate billionaire play ground
epic
Mad MAX : Alpine Episode - They even got the dog !
It is so cool that I live in wendover we’re Dave jumped brodozer over a plane and let’s be honest that jump has to be the coolest jump we’ve ever seen
Next year should be guys only.  Leave the wifes and girlfriends at home.  😒
The Blackhawk is sick 👍
Is that the same cabin that Dave showed under the snow. Looks totally different.
I need one of those snow rails so I can get back to the top of the sled hill
Bucket list trip
I’d pay 10k just to be there and watch
You guys could have should have just made a TV show out of all of this   Why’s discovery or someone else not filming all these guys
5:44 just casually spending up to 1.9 million like it's the price of lunch...  Man it must be nice to be super rich
Lmao Flys the drone into a tree xD
Man, not gonna lie I’m jealous I’m not a YouTube dude to do shit like this.  What a wild world these guys get to live in
Cletus😂😂
No one sends it harder than Cleetus
Everytime I watch the part of them getting out of the helo... I know it's okay but fuck D!  Stop exiting the rotor arc at 12 o'clock!  Those droop stops miss and it's a wrap.
I wonder how much gas they used.
Dave is living everyman dream life!!! So awesome to watch !!!
I like how he casually spends 2 million dollars like no big deal..
Awesome! and i like the avengers theme!!
Awesome !!!
I would put wider tracks and skis on the snow rail.  She won’t sink as much and it will have more traction.
Where is Diesel Dave?? Great time with great people
How many cabins do you have?? Just the two?
Cboys represent🤜
I'm surprised you don't have Danny Duncan in some of these YouTuber meet up videos. He would be a wild one to collaborate with. Not sure if you have already or not if so I missed it.
Snowmobiles just remind me of Ken Block 😔
Blackhawk collection?
I'm all for having fun, seriously I really am.  I just can't fathom what this all costs.  I was brought up to be very careful with my money, simply because I, me, had to work for every penny, really hard.  I do appreciate you all having fun.
Another epic adventure ❤
Cody? I can't even imagine the cost of trasnporting that huge beast.  For what? Let's see it do something.  Or is it just paralyzed there.
I'm with Evan but I think the fact that it's Dave's Blackhawk would have made me comfortable 😂I hate heights
Congrats Cleetus on the blackhawk!
Y do i gotta b a brokie
You Guys do a lot of freakin great job with yours vehicles. Shame that I don't live in US. I would like to flight with You in Yours Blackhawk even if I got fear of heights. Greetings from Poland
Daanng this is literally within a 45 min drive from my house...i live in Logan
This series is a masterclass in content creation. What a crew! Cannot wait to watch what comes next 🇺🇸
1 mil  602 thosuand and 500.. Wow what a deal 😅🤣
He dropped 1.6 mil like it was nothing!!!
Jeez Dave! Phrasing!
Im not a jealous person. Never have i ever been. Im so glad people can do these things and have tjis much fun. But when does it cross the line of being happy for them and wishing you was thier/them? Like.... I wanna play too bro! 😢🥺😢🥺😂🤣😂
These guys look like the characters from M.A.S.K with their suits and machines
Unreal episodes man!
we need more of these snowed in episodes
Snow rail needs wider tracks.....
We're not mr beast two year anti social get to come
I've never been around that much snow. I always wondered what it's like.
Why lie about height jumped , people still are going to watch. Literally imagine if he jumped 50ft high. Actually if u can prove so I fly in 20mill in high end toys to that location .
This video is very wholesome. Livin the dream. Nothin but smiles.
Boys at the cabin. "So deep."
The perfect collab doesnt exist... This:
am I the only one you noticed monster max in the background lol
Nobody that is at the Snowed In series bought that Blackhawk.
This is not only F***in awesome. This is so wholesome and brings joy to my heart to see all the youtubers I watch on a daily basis enjoy their passions together.  Keep it up Heavy D Amazing content
Cleetus was dialed on the jump. !!!!!
With the sound of that car and the backdrop of those mountains and snow and the epic jumps....fucken beautiful.
This is amazing I love the idea of all the creators and there builds this should be a yearly thing 👍 dunno if you know of the but the grind hard plumbing guys do amazing builds they need to be there next year 🤞
Looks like a awesome weekend!!!
You got a winch on that thing lmaoooooooo
Yes the c boys I asked for them 💪
I would really like to meet Heavydspark i wish I could meet you guys
Looks like load of fun.. guys
This was epic
All these machines and ropes and no snowboards??? To do some snow surfing behind the vehicles on a rope
Looks like a lot of fun.
Cleetus IS THE PARTY. But the real hero’s in these videos are editors and camera guys. I hope they get time to have fun and play too.
The Black Hawk was for Cleetus! 🤣
That was a blast to watch!
Evan Breaks everything
Sweet video, I dig the collaboration between all your you tube friends!  Cleetus us all what commitment is! Epic air time awesomeness 😎🤩
Why not longer videos. 20mins is nothing
Came back to see Roman’s reaction knowing he bought it. But I’m so confused.
Please I'm NOT Hateing on anyone of these Guys except Whistling Diesel can't stand what He does.   But I'm happy for them just wish I could afford to have just one of those that they destroy and think nothing about it.
Yo wen r u going to invite me
There wasn't a sign for Ben to run into this time
Children playing with toys
whoever edits your videos needs another raise.
@grindhardplumbingco should have been there
Love this
Robbie looked so excited yet scared. He's a down to earth guy that just works bloody hard and is good at what he does. Keep being you and don't become one of these over the top YT's that does it all for likes. 🤙
Omg roman at wood that’s a throwback haven’t watched him sense I was little
You'd think cleetus would have a parachute to cook whatevers gunna be running
Cleeter for the love of all motorsports please chill in the snow brother 😂😂.
Holy shit what a crew!!! Need more!!!!!!!!
Dave is a bad influence on me too, so far I have bought a dump truck, Sany, can am all because of the channel
I wish I would be there
Being trapped in a cabin in the mountains with a bunch of h⁰rny women would be way cooler than all my idiot buddies. I see them all the time....
Watching now knowing that its romans bird, how did we not get that right away? 😂
Oh man..... you NEVER exit the rotor disc off the nose! Especially with it sunk in the snow!
Damn what time 🤘🏼🤘🏼
Legends
Soooo whoever makes the original sand rail is about to legit be making snow rails.
Im waiting for the part where he jumped too far...
I've been watching you all for a long long time, but especially the CBOYS. It's so cool to see you all get together and have a blast together. Pretty crazy that you guys get to do all that stuff just because you guys bust your but to entertain us and create revenue to do it all.
Loved it
Cleetus needs the Blackhawk just to carry his balls around.
Cleetus OMG🤣🤙
5:40 SO THAT WAS ROMAN'S BLACK HAWK?????
Heavy D that looks like a wonderful vacation but where is Deisel Dave in his shorts. Wow, what a jump and I should say many jumps.
Even just to be out there on a snowmobile with you guys would be way to much fun!! That looks like so much fun. Way cool.
That was epic. Dave Sparks is one of the coolest dudes to invite all his buddies to a winter Wonderland with every toy you could imagine two thumbs up brother.
The snowed in vids never disappoint! Truly some of the best collabs I’ve seen!  Just pure good times!
I definitely gotta figure out how to link up with y’all during the winter. Cause that shit looks like too much fun. I’d never leave until the season was over.
Must be nice to be rich!!!
Cletus hates fat jokes 😂😂😂
You guys gotta have grindhardplumbing out next year.
Was grindhardplumbing didn't make the list?
Love the c boys
Cboys brought me here !!
I'm glad cleet stood up for Westen with Romans comment. Kinda makes Romans comments about "contrariety" as weak as goats  piss!   Westen has done well on his weight, give a brother a break
So he buy this for a friend or is this gonna be a cluster black hawk?
Sounds like ol Cleeter is about to be the brand new owner of a Blackhawk. 🚁
All my favourite youtubers in one video, what else could I honestly ask for
It’s nicknamed the crash hawk for a reason he needs to buy a Huey. That’s the real freedom bird.
He needs to buy a Huey
I was nervous that it was Dave or Garrett flying it like that over the trees. Glad to see they brought out the pro for this flight.
Teach Me How To 🏀
Robbyyyy
Hell Yeah Brother! Cleeter with the full send
Did you fly a drone into a tree?
Hell Yah Brother !!!!! That was EPIC !!!!
Haha buddybof mine is another name for cleeter
“You got a winch on that thing” real classy dude…. Weston is a stand up guy with a big heart
The Snow Rail needs longer and wider skis.
And here in Mn today it was 40 degrees outside and what little snow we had shriveled up like a dip in 50 degree pool. 🥶
Suscribed to all channels, I gotta learn spanish anyways, might as well make it fun! ahaha  Thanks for all you to!
Cleetus definitely needs to come with you guys to the next Turn Em’ & Burn Em’ in Alberta!!!!!!
So...@romamatwood where is the podcast at? You had some pretty good guests and were gaining hard core. Then drops off the face of the planet and nothing to tell your listeners? Jw
These snow videos have been sick!
f'king awesome!!!  I'm an old dude, but I love it.
i have never been so jealous in my entire life lol. one day maybe D will take me for a blackhawk flight =)
Hell ya
Pretty underwhelming.
We know Cleetus just bought a Blackhawk
This would be one of the funnest weekend trips ever. Those bunch of psychos would have a great time. Also, can you imagine the Net worth of all of them combined in one place? We're talking probably over $1B with Roman there
I wish i was that famous 😢 that looks so fun
The Rat Pack of Motorsports
The absolute dream!!!
Great Americans
this was an amazing video. a lot of my favorite youtubers. bring danny duncan and westin
Looks so fun!
KOOL STUFF MR. HEAVYDSPARKS, A LEDGEND.
You guys are crazy. Have fun and be safe. Good job. Thank you 😊
I think if the rail had bigger wider skis it would do better in powder. Thing is sick
The real question is. How’s Maddie feel about that jump?
This is the stuff you dream off right here. One day. One day.
Who says money can't buy fun maybe I should start a channel on all the crazy go fast boat stuff we do here on the great lake of Erie ? nope don't want to work that hard good stuff guys thanks
Love cleetus taking up for Westen , That's mean that's my dawg 😂
Always exclent Cleetus that was Epic. Dave you need a new black hawk
Great to see Robby Layton here! Great channel starting up and always love to see Cleetus!
love it how all my favorite youtubers are all together sick trip
put wings on that snow rail
When you take your boys to the cabin in your own Blackhawk. That’s peak life goals
👀👀👀👀 is Cleet getting a Blackhawk ???????? 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Bad ass
Was Cody here too?
Utah rednecks!😂
That jump was sick AF
I am ok with '90% of our videos endig with broken equipment' as long as they don't end with broken people!
Lol Rich white guys are undefeated!
Best series y'all do by far! Love this!
They should invite. @grindhardplumbing
You can’t help but smile and have a good time watching these guys play in the snow with some awesome toys.
Blackhawks have skis you can install, just like a Chinook. Look into it guys.
This is actually obsurd ... the amount of money this guy has to be bringing in is unreal, literally this guy must be a hundred millionare at least. From what? Who knows, but whatever lol, seems like all these guys make so much money they just dont know what to do with it meanwhile most people work 10x harder and dont even make 1/100th.
I would have much preferred to see Jake Sherbrooke overs cboys
W vid
My favorite time of year when snowed in epoisodes come back hope u do at least 10 this year ! Also show some of ppl just hanging in the cabin . Cooking would be cool
Just a whole lot of good clean funsies! Eh?
This was pretty big SAUSAGES FEST. 😂😂
If that Blackhawk sank/shifted in the snow while they were exiting…. Personally woulda happily waited for those blades to stop. 😅
So glad all these youtubers are coming togethor, its so fun to watch collabs.
I'm always happy to see other people succeed in life but at the same time watching these TV guys, YouTubers, etc with millions of dollars kinda makes me feel for the average working guy giving everything to barely scrape by.
Dang I watched Cleets vid, hada no idea Roman was there too
This man is going to have his own air force
Really wish Ken Block could've been part of this
Come do another jump 🦘
Basketball people are to good to do stuff like that before a liberal comes in the comments 😂😂
Ole black hawk cleet😂
Cool times
Show us more of the madness🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤙🏼🇦🇺🇦🇺
Now that's the definition of a Boys TRIP
Is that a cool gathering 🪄✨💫
Cleetus enters the matrix... again.
ok bro first off sick video honest heavyD never disappoints the Cboys video this week is going to be sick and I'm sitting wishing I can both get a sneak peek at the new video  which is just awesome but the Cboys were in my home state and I didn't even get to meet them
Best video when cboys heavy d and whistlindiesel and all in the same video
Disabled veteran diesel mechanic engineer.   Can I come wok for you?
Rad that Robby Layton was invited. He deserves it.
Best colab in YouTube history
I congratulate you Mr. Sparks on all the success. - Long-time Fan
The greatest collection of creators all having fun in the snow bro this is awesome bruh!
Why not try and get an Apache Helicopter.
Oh to be young again.
I want in lol
makes me so nervous every time they approach or exit the blackhawk from the front
You can you youtube buds need to do a voters outreach program to secure our freedoms
Remeber vote republican in 2024! Dave save America!
Very KOOL
Not a huge fan of snow, since the only bone I ever broke was using ramps to jump my sled as a kid, but this looks epic
Just awesomeness all around..
They flew over me when I was driving
Good to see Robby Layton!
I look forward to this series every year!! Awesome job, Dave's a legend for doing this yearly.
This has to be the coolest group in the world right now. What a blast that must of been!
I need friends like dave Sparks
So disappointed... The jump is just basic at best. You guys have unlimited funds, this could have been better, be honest. Someone on a pulley, on a garbage can lid, would have been way more entertaining.
Man how haven’t I seen your channel before found you cause cleetus
5:32 see how cleetus stands up for western, true friend, why is Roman Atwood even there 🤣🤣🤣
Was there a safety meeting before This
i thought roman was one of the side eye guys for a sec
@lilduval city Boys up?
Livin the dream !
"a buddy of mine wants a Blackhawk" WHO COULD THAT BE
Why are you hanging with Robby Layton?!  😂😂.  That’s a new low.
are the cboys fillming this to
Dude that cabin is insaneeee. Is this Idaho?
Should have left Paddles on that thing not trax
That was some sick footage of Dave! Also the blurry jump editing was insane!
Stoked to see that Robby Layton is hanging out with you all.
I’m actually surprised with Roman’s comment about Chaplin and needing a winch kind of a dick head move tbh
Cleet needs the HELLTRAXX in the rear of the d Sandcar.
This looked like a riot!  The most fun I have ever had on any type of snow machine was on the Yamaha Snowscoot  This was in the early 90's and we had about 15 guys on them with a nerf football playing tag.   Those things are so little and lite you would turn fast roll over and off the machine have to jump back on and get moving again.
All my favourite YouTubers in one video… 😮 🤙🤙 y’all kick ass man
You guys need Westen Champlin at the cabin!
Awesome!
Sick keep going and love the videos and I've been watching for years and not disappointed once keep it up
this is so sick
Absolute carnage! And I love it
Front skis on the rail are waaaay too thin and short!
What’s the app 1:37
Youtubers bidding on black hawk helo...I did life wrong.
How to look like a duche bag while buying a helicopter…
❤❤❤❤❤
George saying “not a double though” knowing he’s the camera man and has to ride shotty. I’d say the same thing 😂😂
The Come back of the 70s stach is amazing
Last year was way better. Not the content per se but the edit and story line. Last year was like watching an actual tv show or movie, this years just another YouTube video
Something you don't want to hear I know. However, I feel it must be said. At this moment,  The majority of Americans are having a very difficult time keeping food on their tables.  And I feel you chose the worst possible time to post a video of the wealthy elite destroying millions in toys. I could be wrong. I am happy that good fortune has allowed all of you the luxuries.  But keep in mind. You are 1%. The rest of us are seriously struggling at the moment.
not needing a winch for westen XD
I'm liking that Pisten Bully.  Looks like the perfect cat for the one snowcat family.
Well none of that sucked
Woowowowowowowow you are so blessed to have what you have , I  am struggling with no heat , major water leak . Working for Walmart an being a retired NCO not making much money , but I have my belief in GOD soooooooooo
Cool to see Robby Layton, would have been cool to see Goonzquad.  Next time, swap them out for WhislinDiesel
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 супер
I respect how you included the cboys and gave them actual screen time where Cletus was all about himself.
Cleater McFarm Tan is always golden! 👌
Next video.  A large group of YouTubers go missing in the snow covered mountains of Utah in a Blackhawk.
What engine is in the sand rail
Looks like Dave doesn’t understand that walking to the front of the blades is the dangerous spot to get decapitated...
Love the forced videos of commercials of crap I’ll never buy. Thanks for the waste of time.
let me put it simple Son ole HEAVY’s got it goin on nowadays 😂 also I just looked down as I was writing this and iv got on the black and white Sparks Motors shirt on , man I didn’t get that call for the W9!!!
hahah EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I feel bad for Dave.
So much for new video everyday 🤦
Garrett bringing all of these guys together is so friggen kill. Especially cause they all do big numbers!
I been looking Forward to this weekend with everybody!!!! Last time you have all the homies over, it was awesome content!!!!
That thing needs bush plane skis it would work
Flies a black hawk, buys another blackhawk, then takes a new snow cat to build a ramp for Cleetus to straight up send the snow rail off. Dave Sparks just doing great things, hats off to you man keep it up bro👍
Please do not exit the black hawk to the front of the bird while the blades are spinning!
Cleet is so genuine. He doesn't like the fat jokes about people he considers friends.
More of these! 💜🔥
Yoo all my fav YouTubers together GOATED Coby’s diesel and Roman and Cleetus
Would love just to be a this You tuber Winter Camp sipping on some whiskey and pointing at all the cool shit!
You are hero man... Living a dream... KING
Epic video, every year I wait for the boys snow videos, Fabrats would have been great there.
Im really getting tired of "The Muscle." Every time he pops up in a video its just negative macho vibes while everyone else is just being kind and enjoying life.
Awesome content. Can’t wait for the rest. And daves place is beautiful….dreams of having something like that.
see this is a prime example men don't grow up we only grow old  the inner 7 year old will always exist
Man I wish I could be down there with you guys
“Oh man, what a deal!” Hahahah
Id love to be out there with yall looks like a hell of a good time
Hang on a minute. 'a buddy of mine wants a Blackhawk' who could that be ? Pretty involved getting type rated on a Blackhawk...
The man bids on Blackhawks like we bid on action figures on ebay lol
Awesome video
good to see robby hangin out with the big dogs
WOW amazing
No matter where Cleetus is he puts on a show !
I feel like I got unsubscribed
Snowed in season, definitely best part to winter on this channel
I looked forward to the snowed in content each winter pls tell me you got another 1 hour vid like last year.
Fucking epic!!! is all there is to it
that "snow" rail is basically useless in loose or deep snow
Cleetus is the man that was sick 🤙🏻 @HeavyDSparks love your content keep up the good work
didnt yall learn from ken block
i dont think cleetus the giraffe could walk under that helicopter blades lol
so sick!!!
i’m so jealous yous guys are freaking awesome
Its Amazing how much money people give these  greedy rich snobs
The snow rail needs wider front skis and wider tracks
When all your fav YouTubers come together. Couldn’t get any better than this. 😊
Snow rail? No way it's the Powder Keg! LoL
Love jour videos bro
Love the snowed in series!!
This is awesome!
Sound of that snow rail gives me a chubby
Sherp!
Honestly one of my favorite videos I’ve seen on YouTube in a long time. Stoked to see Cboys working with Sparks, two of my favorite YouTubers!
Hell yeah
lets be honest... you could have a 2+ hour raw video that has 2+ million views - the amount of go-pro's and HD recorders on that mountain was incredible. That was an impeccible feat worthy of its own DVD. Thanks for putting this together - hope to see more footage of you all collaborating in the future!
This is epic, thank you for sharing
Yep.He`s a BaaaD influance all right.
I love the way Cleets voice kinda quivers when he says "  can ya pull me out?"
PUT SKIS on that UH60
Great friend Dave !
I would die out there without a snow suit and boots.
That scared me when yall landed and it looked like the blades were so low when they walked out 😅
you need to get some skis put on the hawk, we run em here in alaska and it keeps you from sinking into the snow, doesnt add many limitations on the ch47 ( thats what ive always worked on ) but pretty sure its the same on hawks. they are made and manufactured here in alaska
Awesome episode 👏 👌
It’s the best when all your favorite YouTubes collab!
props for picking the best  / most deserving youtubers and bringing them together. grind hard boys next!
The blackhawk have any issues being parked in the snow?
Vanity overload
That snowrail needs some fenders on the rear lol
How big is that place to hold 30 peeps dam
I like Robby but where and how does he fit in he the one where Dave said well we better at least invite him no offense but he definitely not on the same league at all and don't get me wrong Robbie looks successful with his body shop in all but compare that to Dave and cleet a big ole NOPE
Hurts my soul seeing this much fun happen 20 minutes away from me 😂
Really like your  content and videos just started watching very entertaining awesome stuff.
I love your videos always seeing ppl get together and have fun. Always a blast
Best episode ever boys 🤘
Ride on guys I loved it I can't wait for more
Play this needs to put wider skis on there and wider tracks with maybe a little bit longer flaps on the tracks and everything will probably really go through that powder snow
Cleetus -"Hes lost a lot of weight recently, hes down to 300"😂😂
Why don’t you guys just keep a strap inside your vehicle that way you’re ready to be pulled out at all times because you’re going to get stuck in a snow rail thing
Thanks for taking us along!  I just want to say to everyone that you too can do all of this if you work hard spiritually, mentally and physically. It is not taught anymore but the sky is the limit if you want it bad enough!  Dave and Cleetus and Roman and Cody and crew and everyone else all dream big and inspire us who are all working toward our own dreams, thank you. Except maybe own a blackhawk but you get the idea!
Love seeing all you guys bringing each other UP and having fun. That's the way. Love it!
Is the hot tub cauldron up there?
Unreal boys 👏👏👏
Love every channel but when Atwood is in it it is a Big fat No
I can’t wait for the day I can just casually eat tacos and drop $1.6 mil on a Blackhawk 😩
Maybe try without the snowcat. I could groom a trail for my half ton too
This is why I watch YouTube instead of TV. Epic day!
lmao but i`m really stuck, had me dead
Gorgeous country!
This is what you call hanging out with the boys. So badass 🤟🏼
That jump just needed David Attenborough narration to be perfect
AWESOME GOOD TIME!!!!
Thanks for flexing your fun money on us 😂
Sounds like cleetus just got a Blackhawk
Holy crap is there nothing that you don't own LOL I'm dying to get a helicopter one of those single seat mosquitoe. You're my kind of people crazy ass shit going on all the time
Cant wait to see what Cleetus does with his Blackhawk
Gonna see if the cboys know what real snow is😂. They are one of my favorite channels, alongside this one.
Needs more track, a lot more track
boys when can we see some content of the new snowcat i love watching the snowcats work and this Collab is sooooo good.
I don't think you'll drive th Blackhawk out of that! 😅
Gotta give it to Cleetus. No one believed in the snow rail, or even that he knew about snow. Then he shuts everyone up by being THE ONLY person to send it off a jump that day.
Wheres westen at???
You need to bring some Free Skiers like Alex Hall or Mac Forehand and pull them off those jumps!
Can u even put the love muscle in the Blackhawk  after he eats ..or will it  struggle may need a shinook. If he gets hurt .better leave him inside
What brand are their jackets? With the K on them Ik it says Ktm but I’ve seen them elsewhere without
I guess out of any fuel gas in e85 is the best no gumming up and you ain't worried about the batteries freezing like Tesla charging
Should have invited @grindhardplumbingco
I'm giddy you invited @RobbyLayton He seems to be a genuinely great guy... Plus his recovery6 experience might be needed
Epic show no joke
Definitely my favorite episodes! Snowed in for the win!
Bro mint sauce
All the Boys having fun !! Thanks Dave for making it happen!
Snowed in my fav part of the winter time videos
Wider skis and some coil overs with a low spring rate in the front and this could turn into a sport.
How tall is cleetus wtf
I think Cleetus needs a Freedom Hawk for sure
Yall make the best videos! Always puts a smile on my face when i watch them!!
I’ve got nothing but mad RESPECT for you, your brand and your accomplishments. Your content has always been AMAZING and never disappoints. It’s always encompassed your goodness and core values. Your collaboration with Loud & Proud hardcore MAGA white supremacist WD does nothing positive towards your hard work and brand however. 🇺🇸🇲🇽 Best always a Patriot US Marine Corps Veteran.💙
Heavy D Sparks spends money like water. 1.65 Million on another Blackhawk. And he is not even bothered by the expense.
@mikepatey 👀 is was that your Blackhawk that Dave bought?
👌
Anyone else just see dollar signs?
Insane video.  Well done . Look forward to the next one
That Sand Rail is nuts - quickest way to un-make any road the ploughs cut!!
This is the best series that you do , love that you are able to bring so many together and share what you have worked so hard to build.  Thank you
Its great seeing you guys having so much fun.
I miss the old cleetus.
So is your Black Hawk still considered an H-60, or does it revert to Sikorski's S-70 civilian designation since it's demiliterized?
Fcking epic!!! Damn I wish I was there !!
It's just dreamland. Paradise for boys and men !  Who owns the cabin ?
I am SO JEALOUS !!!!!
By far my favorite videos of the channel. Keep it up I need something to look forward too 🤙
Monster max was a no show which is wise of Cody cause it would've been an embarrassment 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
As long as Dave doesn't wipe out , he can airlift you to emergency when the rest of you do 👍
Bad ass , makes me want to leave florida?
Amazing
needs a heated cab
Hell yeah, Im was stoked to see robby Layton
i know why whisltindiesel wasnt on the episode but i know he is gonna make it
What a video 🫡
sheesh the propellers on the black hawk was very close to there heads
Man this is the ultimate collab😂 you got cboys, cleetus, whistlin diesel, Roman Atwood. Great job on the vid
My head exploded seeing all of you together.  EPIC!!
GOLD ❤
everything about this video is fuckin beautiful.
This has got to be a yearly event…..if not 6 monthly……it’s AMAZING!!!!!!! As well as being something I’ll NEVER be able to attend…….Dave, you are my absolute hero…🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾
Dave tell the boys to post
I love the cboys do more stuff with them
I saw your Blackhawk flying over Bountiful yesterday around 11am. That thing looks SO sick!
Love this series. Could legit make a new tv show from this. Where you at discovery
Epic content boys! 🤙🏻😏
🎢
Thanks for Showcasing Northern Utah / Beaver Mt .. Greatest snow.  you lucked out.. we hadn't had snow forever ..then the last 2 weeks got dumped on!
Yes I love this collab ❤
You should find out how far you can fly. A sand rail a.k.a. Clitoris. Like maybe from one mountain to another . Remember, there's only friends when there's no competition. Why don't you have a black c*** race you know? Through the canyons as close as you can come, put one's life on the aint that? What Ken blocked did?  And travis until he jumped off that building and landed on his spi'm
15 minutes in, vleet looks like a news interview of Florida man. 100%
Clitoris McFarland takes off where Travis patrera can no longer do the innovator now the records all belong to you. Not too bad for a drunken rat in front of a camaro with the three twenty boys back in the day
This crew = no better content period!
That is completely awesome!
What a life to live
I can't wait to be a part of Snowed in next year. This is a dream just hanging out with the boys and having a blast in the snow.
Not a fan of listening to bunch a dudes eat tho
What a great group of you tubers let's Go wish I was there!!! All my top channels
I just wanted to see the snow rail buggy. That's pretty cool.Don't follow any of these guys YouTube. All I hear is brown nosing in the comments. What's really going on with a bunch of guys snowed in together up in the mountains. My question is: where are all the women at?
roman atwood is the lorax
What a great video.
A Cboys and cletuss McFarland collab
I love these cross over episodes
Best series ever
Man this reminds me of the good old days when my buddy had his cabin. We would ride for days with our tracked 4wheelers and bikes. The snowmobiles barely got touched, and they were Turbos, and Nos.  But you guys are definitely on a whole new level of Toys.
Man i love everything you guys do, but you need to make that week more diversified. More color other than that chocolate milk...
You’ve gotta get some skis on that thing!! That thing is so awesome!
Dude you should definitely pick one subscriber to come hang out with you guys for a week  that would be a trip of a life time to hang with everyone in one spot.
%#$@$ that guy for making a fun of" Westen" for a laugh   im unfollowing that goof  !  😡
READY TO SEE MONSTER MAX IN ACTION
Hmm, how YouTube millionaires live ... "I wonder what we should do next? ... and then what?"  For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?                                                                                                                                  (Mar 8:36-37 KJV)
"This is the ultimate guys' weekend."
I’ve watched about all the HEAVY D VIDEOS I CAN FIND & these snow ❄️ videos are by far the best the SNOW RAIL IS THE 💣 BOMB it’s just so cool to watch you guys jump it and get it stuck over & over & it still work how amazing you guys definitely know how to have fun wish I could participate YOU GIYS ARE AMAZING PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING ALL OF YOU GUYS ARE AWSOME!!!😊
Do y’all have paramedics standing by lol.
Cleetus seems to have every toy and tried everything but will he get his own helicopter? Is he ready to fly with the big boys, with a real big boy toy?
Its so good to see the Cboys representing Mn being I live only a couple hours from them. Cboys and Sparks are my two all-time favorite channels so its truly awesome to see this video.
I wish I could get to meet you all
That Was SO SO SO UNREAL & EPIC That There's  NO REAL OR GOOD WORDS TO EXPLAIN  IT, JUST NONE AT ALL  !!!!!
Hey what's up hope you guys are being safe having a blast you put together something great with all of the best YouTubers and id love to see more of this and waiting on your next blog drop love what your doing spending time with family and friends cheirsh that all the time you have tomorrow not promised . Seeing everything yall do makes me want to get up and have people like theses guys i like to see you guys do something with hard grind plumbing
We need to get cleeter in a rock bouncer!
Man, this just puts a smile on my face....What better way to have fun, than to bring along all your friends to play?!
@fedeperlam quando trasformiamo il cayenne sherpa cosi'?
I can't even dream about this much freedom anymore 😅 can't imagine how nice it would be to have even a week of this a year. Hell I'd be happy to be able to dream about not having to worry about the light bill once in a while 😅 at least for a moment I'd have some peace 😂.  At least us 99%ers can Live vicariously with the videos😂🤙
So cool to see Robby Layton here. You can tell he is a little intimidated by all these big youtubers !
Snow much fun!
I had a smile from cheek to check watching this. Good on you boys!
a buddy of mine wants one AKA Garret
These are the best videos !!!
I am honestly surprised you didn’t have the ski’s on your black hawk.
This would have been An Epic Episode. Only if The CBugs wasn’t There..There Just Not Loyal Friends in My opinion From watching There Channels. Just to Clarify The guy who Literally made there channel Jake Sherbrooke. They Threw him Under the Bus & Just Cut Him out All Together. That’s Not a Friend in my Eyes. If I Make it one day Everyone who’s Helped will Rise with me..
Of countless years and hours of hopes shattered and comebacks all adds up to that special moment 🤙
Hell yeah brother how many ppl watching just bc our boy Cleetus is on here
Yes!!! Robbie is hanging out!
I hate the fact you bought a blackhawk for less money than it costs in GTA
Don't forget my invitation to come out for the week next year... lmfao I've only seen one snowmobile and that was a drag sled on dirt. I'd definitely like to (try) ride a back-country sled. I'll be waiting for my invitation 😂...  keep up the good work men!!
Cleetus getting a blackhawk!! you heard it here first
cool video
so much fun! while you were playin i was pulling a tracked suburban out of a hill side!
What a crew!! HeavyD you are one amazing man, way to share all of this greatness with so many others, including us!
best youtubers all together
You need a snook helicopter to transport your troops
The snow rail is AMAZING!!! Best video I’ve seen in a good while.
everyone pulling wheelies on a snowmobile dont forget thats how ken block died
Man's buys a new Blackhawk I'm over here struggling for food oh the American dream
That’s awesome,Cleetus is the man
That had to if sounded sick in person    The snow rail and the sleds too just echoing in the mountain
Dave is too rich, I love it!
I have waited all year for this!!!! You all are awesome but better together for sure!
Absolutely insane guys!!!!
best collab ever
Black hawk "is" the crown Vic of helicopters!
I'm so envious, we had 100 degrees fahrenheit yesterday!
Epic content guys
getting black hawk is actually better and cheaper than buying a super car. the skies is the limit.
Yall should collab with the nelk boys
😱🤭🤣👏🇳🇴🤠
Cleetus: "hey Dave, build me a jum-"  Dave: "how big?"  😂legend
sounds like cleetus is getting a Blackhawk
You need to get bradon price
Have you ever thought about making a machine that blows air from the underside at 200 degrees with blowers to melt snow?
Thank you.
always been my dream to have a snow day like this. also liked the signature drone crash in tree.
Big kidz in a big sandbox of snow....looks fun and crazy
Wow im so jealous
You should get with @whistlindiesel to build track for monster max
Where is bud? I haven’t seen him in a while
I'm snowed out.  My neighbor blocked the road to my cabin!  I need help!!! Sending an email to the info@ address, because I don't have Instagram or any of the other social medias.  I think it's uncanny how you are doing a snowed in series right when this happens to me.
Epic video Dave!  This is what I came here to see!!!!
Soo awesome to have friends like that
I think the best part of this is when someone said something negative about Weston and Keaton being bigger dudes and Cleeter defended them , Cleetus is a good dude
Because when you have too much money, you waste it!
"Boom Got It" casually buying a 1.6 million dollar helicopter, Heavy D has bigger fish to fry going on in his head.
YouTube avengers edition... editor makes him black widow... GREAT. Now I need a new keyboard!
👍👍
Wow what an awesome video
..........😄
"Cleetus is gonna get that thing pregnant the way he's holding the bars." LMAO
Dude that was SOOO SICKKKKK!!! 👊🏽
Love your videos!!
Dave, Can you share what auction site you use to bid on these helicopters?
Always love to see it, you got all these guys out there in full snow gear and then Dave's just out there in a hoodie lol
What a sick group of youtubers! Such an awesome video and event you made for them,Dave. Well done. Only one guy which i would like to see here was Matt Carriker. This would be then definitely all of them from my list.
Roman, cleetus and cboys in the same video?? Am I dreaming?
Man now that would be a trip of a lifetime right there.  Enjoy looks like a great time
Love everyone coming together. It's a shame the G.O.A.T couldn't join. R.I.P and enjoy looking down Ken❤
So freaking COOL!! Mr Dave living his BEST LIFE, BABY! So fun to watch!! Every morning needs to start like this with my perfect cup of coffee and some epic DieselBro crazy shenanigans with Mr Dave🤩🙌🤩🙌
Sick collab
Must be tough for Cleetus to not be the top dog and the center of attention in a group like that.
Love it, a bunch of everyday friends having fun.
Need a fucking shirt with Cleetus on it with a bubble sayin. “You pussin footin it?” LOL
And you should get the grindhard plumaco, boys. And they got some toys that go in the snow You should get kevin from junkyard diggs he loves playing in snow
wow all of this is like dreaming haha it looks so much fun! Enjoy it!!
wow !  Yall win !! Best content since the hay day of nitro circus  !!!!!!!!!
That black hawk is the coolest shitt ever
Oh i lovveeeee this sleeping next to the phone for the next episode epiccc
So when does the Blackhawk take all these guys to the Demo Ranch resort?
Thats awesome robby layton got invited out with the big youtubers
This is so awesome 😮
Cheeee hooooo
Estimated height/length of that jump jump,anyone?
Casually getting to your Blackhawk with your friends is like GTA in real life
I've said it B4 and I'll say again,   its good to be in Dave Sparks's Tribe!  A couple days at the cabin,  good friends & cool toys?   Epic 👍🔥😉💕
Would that buddy who want a Blackhawk be Cleetus
So next episode is of Cleet destroying the snowrail. 😂
So happy to see Robby Layton there. I hope he gets a good sub bump, guy deserves it.
Thats the ultimate goal. Cabin in gods country and flying in all your friends on a Blackhawk and having all the toys you could want.
Slow motion lookin funky
That all looks like so much fun!!!!
Oh how I miss snow vehicles.  Thank you for letting us be a part of your antics.
Boys with too much money 😅
the fact you got all legends in one vid is crazyy!!!!!!!!!
I wish this video was an hour
Love it!
I love the snowed in episodes!! Wish I had a YouTube channel just so I could get invited!!
Epic weekend I bet.  Bunch of tonsils together.  What could possibly go wrong?
This and Barrett-Jackson all week are the two shows that will waste my days.❤
We all wish we could be there, even just to watch and smell the fumes and hear all the whoops of joy! Thanks for the vid!
Ya know what if these videos through the eyes of all the channels , Dave Sparks is a very generous,cool dude.
The tracks and skies probably needs to be a little bit wider for that sandrail to not get stuck so easy + they need to fix some sort of fenders over the tracks to stop them from slinging all that snow forwards.
How many million dollars of gear is here
Love the snowed in series ❤
Cleetus Sand Rail is BADASS on those SNOW JUMPS
Dave and cleetus when they  Get together you know it's going to be a badass video and Dave topping it off buying 1.6 million Blackhawk your the man
Freedom factory Blackhawk coming soon and ocean rail is to
I thought whistling diesel was coming up for this event?
So hype for the @cboystv stuff. Dope combo we didn’t know we needed
I love the temporary acid trip when Cleeter jumped the snow rail in slow mo😂
Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick!
I am not getting a Blackhawk you guys 😂
Cletus always goes straight for the tracked machines I think it's safe to say they are his favorite
OTT shenanigans with big boys snow toys - what's not to like here. The next one's gonna get watched!
😂😂😂❤
So sick this event between friends. It's amazing this playground with all this toys.
Dude,,,i am speechless....This is gonna be a epic series!!!
Man wish I was rich an hade buddy’s like that nothing but fun an good memories 😅
Looks like so much fun out there.  Big kids Playland!
Probably the greatest multi Colab of all time
Man would love to know how much Dave’s net worth is 😂 casually 1.7 million bidding
7:04 champ out my seat with laughter 😂😂😂
It's like watching the same thing again but from wish
MAN I would love to see more content like this
You guys are nuts
Nothing like stupid stunts for fun.
These guys shrugged under the rug the fact that they promoted the title scam... Even afyer everyone knew they were a scam...   And hey, where is Danny Duncan?!
"you should be fine"
I have to say I look forward to this video every year now it’s awesome that you bring all those guys together I remember the Jake Paul and Johnny one glad you keep doing it hats off to you
what a great video the colab with everyone was cool!!!
Coolest vid...dave to cleet "im gunner fill your hole in"... lol
To much BBC going on in this video!
Cleetus is the epitome of Full Send lol
The "Rockstars" of 2020s ....
Too many rich A holes together at once its à pissing match😂
What ever happened to that big foot video from a year or two ago that the muscle said was coming soon?
That swnowrail is sick man
wow what a great time be safe god bless
There's nothing worse than being short on power. Well, maybe an endo and beaver tail. 😂 Too cool! I love the sound of these rad engines!!!
@4:40 - Hans became a hugger :D
this video had my adrenaline pumping the entire time!
This should be a annual get together every year
Where was  diesel Dave? Did I miss him
Great fun , thanks
Where was  diesel Dave? Did I miss him
Would like to see some good names of snowmobiling in this pack. Muskoka freerider, hayden throop, boondocknation, brett turcotte, chris burandt. That would be huge with all the snow toys.
You guys should have invited Ethan from Grind hard Plumbing Co. He has a Hayabusa snow bike amongst other snow toys!
Cboys +Cleetus+Heavy=epic thanks boys keep up the good work
This is the best collaboration ever. If you all get together and continue to do different content, 2024 would be set!
Some expensive play toys. Love the slow mo jump of the ramp into the pool.
Epic content!  Dave this NEEDS to be a yearly event!
Love that thumbnail, where cleetus watches himself fly... 😂❤
Jumped tooo far?  IF he jumped and it broke ...that would be too far but it's still in one piece. Epic jump.
Don’t do Garrett Mitchell
👍🏼👍🏽👍🏻❤
Bro this makes the cboys look professional as fuck
You couldn't make content fast enough for us. These snowed in episodes are already awesome
That's called a "step down" jump... I like your content but your 50' tape measures aren't quite accurate. Cool build but don't stoop, pls
Is it me or is Cleetus really tall?
Hell yeah, stoked Robbie Layton got an invite!!
I'm celebrating a $30k stock portfolio today, started this journey with 6k. I have invested on time and also with the right terms now I have time for my family and the life ahead of me
Fucking amazing 😬👌👌💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻👍🫡
Crazy how this is my backyard !
Epic jump brother, keep on keepin on...
I think with wider tracks and larger skis the snow rail could really be a thing. ( and fenders)
Cleetus bar none greatest of all time! There always has to be an ignorant person in every crew
The epitome of cool is bidding on a 1.5M helicopter on your phone while eating a taco.....
Dud i love ya n very much love your crew camera men woman etc yall are amazing i literally watch this channel to be like ok whats next👀.... But im gunna say i almost got scammed on tiktok watch out yall!!!
Ah wish the video was longer. Cool to see everyone there having fun
Looks like a blast and everyone seemed to be having fun and in great spirits. Did any of the machines break or malfunction to the paint of non use or deserting its riders?
This series is amazing!!!  Can’t wait to follow along, this looks like an unforgettable time for all!
Bring the Demolition Ranch crew up to play in the snow!  Invite me!
if this isn't the ultimate guy's trip i don't know what is.
Absolutely awesome
Love seeing all my favorite YouTubers together
14:18, Cleetus says " Build me a jump." I paused the video, went to get my helmet, put it on at my kitchen table, just to WATCH the rest of the video, because I know this is going to be epic. Update: Sure enough! I can't wait for episode 2!
Us poors can only dream 😂
if i wasn't watching youtube all day i could probably spent 1.6m on a blackhawk too... instead i'm assisting D with buying his by supporting him
Bro just casually buying a Blackhawk at lunch. God I wish I had f off money.
Loved watching this!!
Hell Yeah Brother !
Id give a testicle to have been able to hang out with those boys on that weekend! Maybe both 🤣. What an awesome group of fellas and a stellar fleet of absolutely amazing RIGS! jealousy at its finest! KUDOS GUYS!
Yeah I bet you do got a million dollars like frr you ain’t gotta show it off to everyone heavydsparks like fr most people aren’t like you
Boys Trip
Where can we get that army green Kit Heli ops hoodie Heavydsparks?  Kit Heli don’t have merch on their site, thanks for the awesome videos
could have been an hour long 👏👏
Why am I not up there with you guys like come on
Brokeback mountain YouTuber edition!
Seems like Heavy D is assembling Black Hawk army now...😂😅
Best part is no Side by side blog guys!
Wild!!!!
Cleetus's snow rail needs wider tracks for all that power.
You guys having all the fun so awesome. Sick jumps
MSM TV is lame compared to content like this.
Now that’s how you do a winter weekend! All the toys you could need and the great company to go along with them. How do I get in on one of these weekends? Haha
Diesel Dave, you're best video yet. Not so much talking more action that is what I like And I generally find what I like a lot of people like.
Cletus McHangtime 🤙😎
I look forward to this gathering from last year until we are dead
Between HD and Cletus these 2 channels are kicking out some awesome content
Laughed my ass off about picking up Champlin.
Keep posting more videos that was assume what a crew of guys
So cool that Robby Layton is involved now.
That Buddy is probably Cleetus seeing how he got his Blackhawk rating the same time Dave did. Selling retired military equipment to the American people when they leave literally billons of dollars of equipment behind after leaving other countries. Gotta make that money off us citizens while we give it away to everyone else. The amount of Helicopters and other vehicles and equipment the government left behind after Vietnam and in Iran, Iraq for example is just insane.
That snow rail needs those extra wide Simmons skiis.
2:19  I DID NOT JUST SEE THAT!  I was trained by the US Army to turn wrenches on the H60.  HOW HAS NOBODY TOLD YOU TO NEVER ENTER THE 10 o'clock to 2 o'clock AREA OF THE SPINNING ROTORS?!  I have seen Army archival videos teaching us that those blades will separate your boots from your knees if a gust of wind hits them just so while you're in range. I have seen videos of helmets come off shoulders, still strapped to chins, because those blades flap with no remorse.  NEVER APPROACH/DEPART A BLACKHAWK FROM/TO THE FRONT!!!!  Put a video camera at the 9 o'clock position watching the helicopter. While the blades are rotating, hold collective full down and push forward cyclic. You'll see....
I wish my friends had the same level of motivation as all you guys, no one ever wants to go do anything.
....I had a dream last night, that ''MY COMPANY'' was one of the companies that did what that one in KY did to DAVE's BLACKHAWK to MH53's the BIG BIG ONES like the new OSCERS or wutever letter they are up to now, I BEEN ON a 53E ... was on the USS OKINAWA LPH3 1985-1988 ... anyhow...  we came up to help you HEAVY LIFT some stuff that was just out of limits for the BLACKHAWK (at alt or wutever) so it was safer jumping up to a HEAVYER HEAVY LIFTER copter....   anyhow....  was pretty cool like PICKING UP THE FREEDOME BUS and pulling it up into the air and puttin it back down by the cabin cuz the tracks like decentragrated or at least DISSASSEMBLED THEMSELFS VIOLANTLY about 32 miles away when the WHOLE CREW wanted to go the AS THE CROW FLYS DOWN THE HILL TO THE PIGGLYWIGGLY or wutever they have up there lol .....  anyhow the DREAM was AWESOME!!!  MUCH FUN HAD BY ALL !!! just wanted to share...  back to the FUN IN THE SNO DONT YA KNO :)   1:40 unpausing.....  (in my head I hear the opening to TOP GUN when you all get that BLACKHAWK ready to fly!!!!)  HHAHAHAH LOL ROCK ON !!!  ''LOVE JOY COMPASSION <-----the ROOTs of ALL THINGS GOOD !!!!! :) ''  '' '' .ELEVATE not escalate !!!!! ...the ONLY THING...  ...that should BE BANNED...  ...IS THE HATE !!!!!!! '' (ALX_MKL_me) ''
So do whistlindiesel and lujan have a thing? The girl in the white after the helicopter flyby is 100% her!
Sherp is russia vehikel is bad to help russia!!!
Robby Layton .... Nice to see y'all have some "down"  time even though you're still filming 💞
That's a no brainer Cleetus getting a black Hawk.
You play hard what an amazing crazy time these people get to enjoy. Hell Yeah Brothe! r
Fenders onthe rail
dude just casually drops 1.6 on a blackhawk? how ? where? cos youre gonna get guys in suits in shades coming after you a la MIB.
Argh why is Hans face grey he looks like death warmed up.. sorry dude I luv ya but you don’t look to well in this aye hope everything is okay
First time actually watching the snowed in series as it comes out
This group is CRAZYY! Holy
I believe a caught a glimpse of lujan there. Didnt know girl we're allowed 😅
You should build a tow truck with your buddies make the ultimate tow truck with your buddies
Look at all the Freemasons in one place just missing Matt carriker he must not be as highly ranked as the satanic freemasons
Snowed in episodes are my favorite content of yours. Plus you had all my other favorite youtubers there 😂
Yeehah
Dave, looks like Cleeter Rail needs some snow management on them tracks. Something to divert it away from the passenger compartment.
every time you think dave cant get any crayzier he kicks it up 100 notches love it from australia
Did hands really just hug cletus???😮
That's some awesome rides out there you guys. Stay warm and keep it together for sure it's dangerous. And those are some dangerous moves taking and bringing those rides out there that's not meant.,or made for that at all. And you guys are straight up rocking it out. Y'all should try to get Micheal sabo that has A Polaris to build A tracked vehicle out of one of his builds collaboration video.
Hey heavy d sparks are you doing the cauldron this Year?
Just casually buying a black hawk that’s pretty normal
B o us with there toys, hopefully nobody got hurt.
I think Ken Block would have enjoyed being there with y'alls
Well done... Well done
Mam you guys know how to have fun, and I don't mean cliche rock star crap, just a pile of wholesome sheit.
13:33 George's face is priceless
I love these!!! There so fun to watch and I get even cooler in person
You should make some shield for the backseat of your rail it'll keep the snow off you or at least help
Now that right there is American dream I wish I could do that one day just live life
Snowrail needs some real tracks
Cleetus said he was gonna get a Blackhawk
that ski rail flys down the hill!!!!
What windisl si no the challenge
Why is Heavy D soo cool and down to earth???? Because he worked very hard for everything he has. Wish I could meet him someday and shake his hand.
Next to flying seaplanes, running snow cats comes a close second funnest things I’ve done in my lifetime 🙌🏻
Roman got that mullet rock in just so he can fit In I guess, lol, very cool collab! I have to admit love seeing this ..
Most amazing slowmo
Love these snowed in series! What a sick experience to be up there!
Love the content, loving the toys!! Keep it coming
I think Hans is in love with Cletus!!!
Is there anything left for Dave to do???
This would be my dream vacation with all the best peaple
Ecclesiastes 6:9
Awesome! Behind the scene video of logistics would be awesome! from bringing all the toy to the cabin, food service, sleeping arrangement. loved the snowed in series from the start!!
Literally my biggest role models all in one video! So happy you are all together can’t wait to continue this series!
Best colab in a min time to watch 3 more povs 😂😂
Snow cat would be fun for an operator u would never run out of material
Just Awesome and another Blackhawk coming in 😎. Glad to see Robby Layton  made it 👍, But Where's Diesel Dave? Have a great time you all deserve it💪. Great party your putting on HeavyD 👍
Great video guys!! Keep up the great work!
Hear me out! MonsterMAX on tracks.
This hyped me up bruh seeing all of my favorite streamers hopefully I can meet all of y’all one day
Come on now.....What on Youtube is better than this!!    Dave is killing it!!!
So much better without the paul brothers. these seem like genuine folks.
This is the absolute best video ever!
That’s one way to start 2024, Absolute stellar content! One of the top YouTuber collabs.
When your friend says build me a jump. You say how high!
You got a winch on that thing? Lmfao
Hell yea love the boys all together
Epic, I love the snow.
I love all you guys. Been watching a long time. I like and don't comment much. You guys are all awesome though. I watch Cleetus and you all the time. I love to live vicariously through you. Heavy machinery is my favorite. Also the snow stuff. And the racing. There's so much. Wish I could afford to do it myself. You guys are awesome!
As someone once said to streetbike tommy "you can go twice as fast"
its nice to see hans compliment cleeters jump. usually hes a critique expert. then again , the wizard wasnt present so that probably explains why hes enthusiastic
Best you tube vid of 2024
Love to see Robby in on this!!
Awesome 👏 ❤
Those can ams on trax look sweet to
nenenenenene
Sure glad there's no laws against having fun because if there was lm sure you guys would be in trouble 😵‍💫. Very interesting 🤔,an thanks for sharing.
Bidding on a blackhawk for a friend?  🤔🤔 Cleetus Aviation? 👍👍
Of all that cool shit they have out there i want a Sherp there a multi purpose do all machine
first thing that came to my mind when I saw that jump was ''I BELIEVE I CAN FLYYYY'' lol.
Bros out here living the dream !!!!
I’ve never seen so much money in one place in my life WOW!
I just gotta give props to heavy D n his crew. You guys are amazing to put on a event for the pop stars!!(jk) great job n you guys are definitely blessed!!
Is that wd i seen
Yeah cleeter is totally getting a blackhawk!
So what happened with Weston?
You have all just showed me what happens when dreams come true!!! I wish I could be able to anything close to this in my life. Congrats brothers 💯
looks like a bunch of rich dudes stroking their egos lol how annoying
So sick!!
only word i have for this video is Epic!!
If you could add it into your trip again.
Cleetus put a smile on pastrana’s face with that jump and made him a little envious that he didn’t think of it.
F'n YouTube money!   Love it!
Why this dis on Westen
lost mad respect for this dude. show off
2 sets of ads within the first minute is wild
What an absolutely amazing operation!
EPIC, Dave you are one cool MoFo. What good are toys without friends to share them with? Awesome content guys!
Where is diesel Dave
What I've learned is that if you want the coolest friends to show up for a great time, just buy a race track or a mountain. Simple.
M.O.R.R.???
🔥💕👌👍
Didnt expect to see Wistling Diesel here 😂
let..... me..... join.... you.....
We need a Sparks & Mcfarland channel!
Totally awesome that Robbie Layton got invited to Snowed In !!
Mr. Beast content has gotten so corny, artificial and repetitive.. all these guys and the Cletterverse of friends are making content nobody can touch.
These people are no longer in realistic zones for the average person.
9:06 A monster maxx video we wont see for another 3 months 😂
I got to fly in a Blackhawk while over in Iraq. What an experience that I will never forget.
9:56 diversity!! Ha!
Love this collab
Love this series but where is demo matt
Love the cabin videos in the snow!!!
The first start of the video when you were getting into the Black hawk Roman should be code pilot
I love this little series, looks like the funnest time you could have with friends.
Bring Hans along to be the cook?  kitchen or office, thats where his type belong......
At least whistlen diesel was only seen once! That kid will purposely break every machine upthere he has no respect from me every single other person there does that kid is not cool just super disrespectful!
Best part of the year when Dave has everyone come up to the cabin!
Running out from under that moving blade w it sitting on unstable snow would freak me out. ... flying is fun
Heavy D throws the biggest toy party ever.  I love watching these episodes with all the boyz
Great video
Wow I could watch that content for hours. Thank You.. You Rock.. And I think You should name Your new cab over big hips because of the big back end. Just sayin.. LOL..
God bless rednecks with paychecks! this is awesome
Sadly back to reality, I cannot ask much as I am just 1 person who cares, my request is who in this group understands the importance off Ukraine unfortunately needing to remove this Russian assault from their lands. If I could ask 1 request, please join together in as many areas of your various channels public viewers support and find a way where togetherness can show your unwavering desire to support Ukraine in the unfortunate war they have been forced to fight. No country should have a war placed upon themselves when a leader like Putin decides he is looking for a land grab within a sovereign country who never caused any military actions. Just imagine how strongly and with complete determination you would respond and commit to this event if it was USA who was under invasion
dayum😂
What's better than a black hawk?
2:53 Haylujan spotted. her and Whistlin Diesel are for sure together.
Good job
Where is @SXSBlog and the Michigan boyzzz!? @HeavyDSparks @CleetusMcFarland
How much would it cost to rent a perhaps smaller cabin like this but with plenty of toys to go with the boys, man just for 1-2 days that would be so fun.
I could load my sled and be there in 2 days!!
The amount of work you and your crew put into every single thing you do is so immensely impressive!!! I’d love to be able to experience it all one day!!
So perfect seeing all these lads together enjoying life, yes some extreme events are happening, the audience knows the group as a whole are both filled with adrenaline and excited to explore the boundaries during this first time snow gathering. Best wishes, hope the memories will become a favourite in life 👍👍👍👍
"a friend of myn wants one" hmmmmm what two just got there Blackhawk license ? cleetus n the man himself! that'd be cool to see cleetus get one.
This is such a great video
Awesome to witness thanks for sharing, Dave...
Please please invite grind hard plumbing Co... this is so amazing seeing you all get together!! Wish my Channel was big enough to do stuff like this with you guys
hi
Badass🔥🤘
Atwood … LOSE THE MUSTACHE
I like this version of the show. Cottage life is real life. Bring the big toys and you can have a blast. We been doing that for many many years. This is my normal life on a different budget.
DAAAVVEEEE BROOOTTHHEERRRRRR😂😂😂😂😂 YOU WERE BOOOOGYING in the black hawk that low fly by was insane
You need some bear paws on the Blackhawk if you’re gonna be landing in snow..don’t forget dynamic rollover brotha..peace
G’day Heavy D, Sparks motors team, teams guests suppliers supporters & Co ;-)  Holy dually BatMan Such an epic fun day, with awesome fantazmigorical toys, with the mechanical know how to keep it all running in freezing conditions is exceptional.  And the cinematography is absolutely brilliant too, ( even the drone crash..again..) much kudos to the whole team of teams.  So looking forward to seeing the next episode of snowed in, jumped up, octane boosting, rip rawing, SLAGs ( screaming like a little girl) in the back woods with a few mates!  So we’ll done coordinating all these wonderful entertaining peoples with their amazing toys on the same week just to play!  Totally wizard! Lol..  Congratulations on another Black Hawk Betty…  So go play, create magic, enjoy every moment of now!  With many source blessings with truth clarity love light laughter happiness joy fun play creativity adventures abundance wisdom wealth health and may peace be with you all! Victoria Australia 🇦🇺 xox
This was AWESOME to watch!!!!! Can't wait for the rest of them!!!!
This is the collab we didn’t know we needed and definitely didn’t deserve. Awesome content 👍🏻👌🏻
That was the best YouTube video I watched in along time and the cboys put up some good videos out there.
My buddy (cleeter) wants a Black Hawk. Fixed it.
You are all so blessed! Never take it for granted! Love watching your success and thanks for letting us ride along!!!
So cool!!! I love this representation of good clean wholesome fun! Not the boozed up lunacy that is so pervasive by many in our society.
As a south mississippi boy, I could only imagine how much fun I’d have with Dave and the boys on the mountains!
Where is Diesel Dave ?
This is one of those videos I could have watch another hour of.
We can all agree that we need more collabs like this
Dam what I would do to have a day like this with good people like allu guys
Thank you for putting this together Dave, absolutely something I look forward to every year. It’s been a good distraction for me today as I am laying in bed sick.
Damn these videos are epic
Now yourself and Cleetus has completed the Blackhawk training, can you fly with Cleetus as your second pilot ? Just watched this latest video, remember your earlier video together and this popped into my mind
My dream squad 😮
Pays 1.6 mill for a helicopter and acts like it's nothing 😂
That's a lot for a chopper
My favorite episodes! Excited Cleet is getting a black hawk! Would die if I got invited one year!
Epic
At least there is something to do in the winter🏂
it literally seems like you guys are living in a different reality.
Funny Robby Layton’s name wasn’t plastered on the screen lol.  You’re too wholesome for these guys Robby. Don’t stoop dude
Heavy d whistlin diesel roman Atwood and cleetus McFarland and c boys some of my favorite YouTubers 🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
Just casually dropping 1.7 million
Did anybody see monster Max it looks so good
Bidding on a Blackhawk because my buddy wants one? Cleeter? You getting a Blackhawk???
It's not ideal when Dave Sparks repeatedly says "I'm gonna fill your hole" 😅 😂 no wonder Cleetus wanted to abort and go on them trails ...jks 😂
Snow rail drag racing.
Dayum! Cletus’s black kawk entrance was amazing! Like a effing dragon jn the night!
Only watching for Cletus and hans
Hans:  You want chocolate milk and cookies?  Epic delivery, Bro!
I wish I could come with you guys! And just watch as you have fun and maybe be the one transporting the people back and forth. and it would have been just an experience to go to the USA
All my favorite people in one video
Awesome content, you really put the meaning in go big or go home . Goodfor you  guys , you really put on a great show !
Welcome to the biggest sausage fest in Utah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PARTY!!
shame on you
Don't forget what happened to ken block be careful
Loved it brother. That is all I can say.
Nobody has a bigger winter swag than Dave Sparks!!
Definitely a fun video.
when does Richie Rich arrive at the cabin?
Hi lts Ravi here from south Africa. It's LEKKER fun meaning epic fun
A M A Z I N G ! More-more-more-More-more-more
Is it deep so deep
15:00 . The more complex the mind. The more the need for Simple play. You guys are proving that to a tee.
So stoked on this series!!
WTF! Even Robby is there. Awesome trip
always love seeing the cboys make an appearance
Been waiting for these vids!!!
Awesome! Next episode please😊
If there’s a tick in a box to aim for. Yep. Tick! Nailed it.
I would love to go do that with them
Why you doing Cleets bidding Dave😂
FUGGIN AWESOME 👍👍👍
It would be nice if you added a channel to these guys,no clue who they are besides Cleetus,the rest are just no name/no fame wanna bees
That's was sick. All of it. Lol😅
Hey D. Can I come play with you guys ?????
Dave has no idea he said “I’m gonna fill your hole in……” 18:27
you're missing a few others that would make it fun...  Derek from vice Grip Garage..  and Paul from Fab Rats.. they both like HP and ain't got much fear..  Looks like a great Time,  hopefully everyone comes home intact..  it's a Given Whistlin Diesel's gonna Blow something up or Destroy something nice..  Wait for it..
More please!!
Big smile on my face the entire episode long 😃👍
I can only imagine the diesel brothers contacting insurance “ yeah a couple of guys , Blackhawks , ski adapted machines and might boil them in a mega wok with a few other ideas “ 🫣
It's so sick seeing litteraly the top youtubers I've watched all for 8+ years all together
I watch every single one of yall on YouTube, I sure hope I get to meet all of you guys someday, yall are rowdy n inspirational, yall need to come kick it up in Idaho sometime
Love the c boyz
“Nothing better than being stuck on the mountains with your buddy’s”  Next scene 🎬 ——   “All hop into black hawk”😂😭  Like they couldn’t fly out love these guys fucking living! & doing it right! No Nonsense straight character & respect.   These men/women are the good that’s still left in the world they just trying to show us we can do what we love too.. don’t let the corruption blind you from the GOOD!
FREAKin EPIC!!!
The need for fenders on cleetus's snow rail is epic, And wider tracks like 2 3/4 foot wide would work awesome..  lol
Flying the Blackhawk there was a big flex
Love seeing the avengers together! Cboys are finally recognized in the big leagues! Love to see it!
Wow, so much fun playing in the snow ❄️
Awesome looking trip.....don't threaten Cleeter with a good time!!!  Ever!!!  Be safe and have a blast guys!
All I gotta say is I trust these people more than those meeting at the economic forum in davos
DUDE WE NEED GRIND HARD PLUMBING CO PLSSS
Robby Layton?
Epic fail on the sand buggy needs wider tracks and fenders should’ve known that all that power where you think the snow is gonna go😅and the power with no wide tracks, of course is going to dig down
That snow rail is insane
This is just like my vacations....take away all the toys, the black hawk helicopter, the mega cabin and the vacation because I am a dumb dumb without a youtube channel with a blue collar work ethic.
This is a small towns net worth in 1 video 😭😭
Dave deserves everything he does hard-working man well-deserved
Hey, we have a 2010 Kia forte, we're looking for a TWM short shifter, but it so happens when I go to the website it only gives me links to other websites. Got any advice?
Not bad boy's  But all this track action and no tank ! In the snow. I guess that is to hard for you boy's  lol. Reverse Psychology
Hey yall, just be careful. This is how ken block passed going too hardcore :/ DDon't go out there alone!
Watching those guys ride in on Dave's BBC with smiles on their faces,, was poetry.
all of my favorite creators
I’m in Logan and would love to come up there with ya!
Amazing as always!!!
That was soo sick seeing that thing fly!
tax the rich.
I have 0 followers, 0 videos, BUT I want to have some fun with you guys! If I pay for my plane ticket next year, can I invite myself... I mean, can you invite me🤣🤣🤣🤣
I would suggest slightly bigger skies for the sand rail.   I think that would help with it's performance in the powder.
its crazy how most these guys are famous but dont have any actual skills aside from buying cool stuff and filming it. robie can paint but hes probably the least famous
Badass getaway.
I’m lookin forward to the videos of your new Blackhawk
By the way I think I am jealous 😎🇦🇺
These guys make the most entertaining content on YouTube.
Why didn’t you invite Matt Carricker?
Epic video 😂😂😂!!!!!!
You guys are nuts I mean nuts 🔩😎🇦🇺👍
This series is NUTS! I love it!!!
Get Starlink in the Blackhawk…
Cletus hawk!!
I loved the video. However the was a problem with the UH-60 ops. I'm an experienced UH-60 and UH-1 crew chief. You broke a big rule when you exited the Hawk, while the blades were turning. NEVER exit a UH-60 to the front when the blades are turning. A small amount of forward cyclic from the pilot on the controls, and the rotor system can drop down very low to the front. By low, I mean take your head off low. Always exit to the side when the aircraft is running, the way your pax did. There have been fatal incidents with main rotor blade strikes to the front of the aircraft in the past. I hope the other pilot (I'm assuming he was the PIC) brought this up to you after the flight. Also I hope that you debrief with the other pilot, and crew chief (if you have one) after each flight. Also if you carry pax, you really should have a qualified crew chief in the back to keep the pax under control and safe.   Love your UH-60, great content, be safe!
You should invite the guys from grind hard plumbing they have some cool snow toys
I can't believe all the fun you guys have😅I'm so jealous 😅Please be safe 🙏 ❤️ 💖
I would love to see you guys ride and films with chris burandt
Where is @MikePatey and Scrappy?!
DUDE... this has to be the most exciting gathering I have ever seen!!
I still dont get why snow tracks are at those angles.  Is it for the purpose of staying on the track at high speeds?
When again are you acquiring a CH-47?
Epic adventure 😊
You should make that snow cat so the snow doesn't get in the engine or on you people
A 100% sausage fest ...  not a single outdoors, ATV riding, adventurous woman !   Was also hoping to see more Whistlin' Diesel and his Monster Max.  Maybe next video (on both counts) ??
I've done that to my racing trike it's insane
This 70 year old man has seen a lot of things in my years but nothing like watching you all play on that mountain
Epic. That is all
This is a great group I bankin on cboys last year and this year
On FB, a friend posted a short on this. And, "HeavyDsparks." And, here I am... Sub'd
I was across the road skiing when you guys did the hill climb in the snow rail, it sounded awesome!!!
Watching while anchored at a remote island in the Bahamas and I can't believe how amazing this video is! So much respect! BTW I am writing this while my wife is rolling her eyes at me.......Hahaha
Garrett the video you put out suck compared to this what's with that
Just wondering when the "wives" weekend is at the cabin, when the boys stay home with the kids.
Cant wait to see everybody’s content from this trip
Those Blackhawks were probably the ones that North Carolina decommissioned a few months ago. My buddie's sister flew them down to Alabama and got to get on the NASA super guppy that happened to be on the same airfield.
It's like cold Glamis.
I like cleetus sticking up for Westen Champlin "that was mean that's my dog"
Time for bigger skies and longer and wider tracks for more flotation so it doesn’t sink so hard in the powder
I look foward to these videos every year. You all are awesome
If  didn't pick up Western I'm gonna be pissed..only authentic one besides cleetus
Sand rail needs 4wheel tracks. That looked like SO much fun. Ty for taking us along
❤
The first video of yours I watched was when you guys had the big hanging bowl and you made "Bro Soup".  I've been hooked ever since.  I absolutely love the snowed in series every year.  I think if you put wider tracks on the snow rail, it will be 100 x better. The rear would get buried less and it would better the control and speed. I love the build, it's a great idea!
Looks like a great time with great people
Maybe next time have Demolition Ranch.
Hans is like Cleetus’s voice of reason, but Cleetus doesn’t hear a single thing.
Riding out there must be nuts
When i live in Southern Canada and cleetus mcfarland has seen more ft of snow in one video than I have in whole life
Well, you win.
You guys are savages I love iiittt
how long until there buying  an f16 and and an aircraft carrier
What an awesome upload! Amazing friends in an amazing setting! ❄️ 🏔 All star crew
i like how bobby layton always and i mean always has to wear something with his name on it,so people know who the hell he is i guess!!!lol
That’s so cool y’all got together. I would love to see the videos that you guys keep on the low. Lol
ah yes,the joys of being rich!!!would love to try that someday!!!lol.
Where's your cabin? It looks like around Beaver Mountain by bear lake where we have a cabin.
YES!!!
Got to throw some track fenders on the snow rail
Ive never rode a snow mobile or been in snow that deep. It always blows my mind how those things seemingly ride on snow like a jet ski does water
Awesome video
Love the crew this year
That blade was so close to cutting a head off
WOW HOW AWESOME AMAZING IS THIS VIDEO.....Thanks so very much and stay SAFE guy's.....                                                                     Old F-4 Phantom 2 fighter jet Shoe🇺🇸
Got to pull out the excavator hot tub and warm up!
I love you guys I wish I was there
This is great!!!
Epic trip!
Dave should be entitled to first drop of the footage from his place . I can’t imaging the logistics, planning and stress he and his guys had to deal with having all these guests over.
Twin turbo a sled
I'm already in the 801 please!!!!
glad I get to live through your eyes Dave, Cleet  you guys have fun and that helps really with my stress  kipster
"A buddy of mine wants a blackhawk." aka Cleetus. LOL
Why did the bring roman atwood ?😂😂😂😂 guys gay
I LOVE THIS
Literally looks like the greatest time ever.  Holy hell.  Dave has EVERY toy known to man at this point....living his life to the absolute fullest.  Such an inspiring man.
Should've had grind hard plumbing
Thanks for the video! Smiling watching this. My boys with the bad ass toys! Fired up my pitter and ripped through the snow just now in your honor! Love you guy! Stay safe..
This is all epic. But thumbnail dude needs to reel it back a little. Unless you show Cleeter jump the house. Please.
"you got winch on that thing?" 🤣🤣🤣
Just a couple of guys joshing around.
Another blackhawk?  Chinook all the way!
That must be nice to be able to hang out with all the homies, doing and getting to watch other people doing cool stuff.
This video was nothing but amazing every shot of the camera! Hat off to Ben for taking control of that beast
Can’t wait to see it
I want to see monster max 2 try and drive up there lol
who's place are they at
Need to add some snow fenders on that thing
It's cool to see Robbie Layton with the boys!
The skis, going through the trees on that snow rail look gnarly
I couldn't stop smiling
id like to know if theres drama between these youtube channels trying to make themselves look good if front of everyone
Where's DieselDave???
Love this series! Thanks to all the guys who do the work in the background
they took bens joke the wrong way. its funny. they made it weird @cboystv
After what happened to Ken Block, I'd find a different hobby, personally.
So you have cletus and roman, but not Matt?
Btw boys av had yous on ma tele in Scotland afore youse done YouTube ! Gasmonky as well at must b 6 years at least next invite keep me in mind lol 😜 loving sparks channel as well 👍
When will we see some work on the wrecker build???
I wonder who the buddy is that wants the Blackhawk 🇺🇸🦅🇺🇸
Airmail
McFarland snowrail motocross.
So miss playing in the snow, why did I move south?
Jeepers. It's like an episode of Mad Max on snow. Yahoo!
WD there with monster max! The snow adventures just keep getting better and better
A collab episode of everyone at the end of the weekend showing behind the scenes how all the channels came together with preparations, filming and logistics would be interesting to see.
DANG! I'M JEALOUS! LOVE YOU GUYS!
I'd like to see that rail outrun a avalance in the BC bugaboo's.
epic video! epic toys!
This was a great video and one of my favorites
"Snowed in episodes" with a blackhawk for trips to town 😂
You boys always have the best time! You can include me!😂
Dave said hes gonna fill Cleeters hole 😂
Cleetus i think your flight would have been way better on a BlackHawk don't you agree?!!!!!!!!
Slow mow with the piano music that was perfect. Made you think Hanable Lecter was driving the sand rail. Just a normal day in the nut house.. oh we do this all the time... Lol. Keepemcoming
How come the girls never join the fun?
You guys are having a great time. That’s awesome. Love playing in the snow with machines. Keep pushing those envelopes guys enjoy. Be safe.
Blackhawk Friday sale, two for one!!! Woohoo! Let's go brothers!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
rip ken block
Bring it really mountains without a groomer to get it to look good do it  in nature mountains without man made jumps  just a dud
Can you be my best friend diesel brothers?
That looked way too fun. I should've been there.
ive never seen hans like someone as much as he likes cleetus
Money doesn’t buy happiness…..maybe but it Sure makes It easier.
Love the videos
Where can I buy your  tow ropes you use
Nice cabin and land does that belong to you
Oh hey the doubted the Cleeter, never doubt the Cleeter
Awesome, just awesome brothers !  Keep filming, helping and having fun !
18:30 Dave really loves Cleetus he wants to fill his hole…!!
Dang!
I’m so jealous! Looks like a ton of fun
damn, i need an adventure.
Good to see Robby Layton up there with y'all.
Crazy how they went from one video drag rave ruby to now best friends and doing crazy shit together 😂
someone needs to learn to sling with heli now lol
LET'S GO DIESEL DAVE SIR AND THE WIZARD. THEY WILL NEVER BRAKE EVERYTHING.
@HeavyD ...they make skies/snow shoes for UH-60s
I am so stoked with where the youtube community is at right now its awesome, everyone you see in this video are all helping each other to become better human beings and move up in this crazy world and having blast while doing it🤘
Awesome stuff!! Cletus is fearless and a bit crazy IMO. Can't wait for the next installment.
I’m jealous of what ya all do!  Lol
This is AMERICA!
By far the best episode ever, also love seeing "the muscle" make an appearance in these videos.
💯💯💯
THIS CONTENT RULES
Exiting the rotor disk at the 12 O'clock is a no-go. Where's your crew chief? They're supposed to keep PI's from doing dumb shit like this.
Love this series
Way cool!
That slo-mo effect is so bad. Just play it in real time
Was just in Salt Lake city and the videos don't do it any justice in Utah
ive never gotten to ride a snowmobile, never got to even see one in person, its not common where i live i guess but if i ever got the chance id hope it be somewhere like this that has so much snow touching the ground is not a option. a foot maybe 2 is the deepest ive seen an it was only around for maybe 2weeks to a month an that was the worst storms we've experience in my almost 40 yrs of living here so in that time frame maybe 2 times has there been what i feel like is enough to ride something like that so for me id have to travel from ky to where ever has snow like that. we get it but a couple inches is all we usually get a good storm will be 6" an its usually cleared up in a week or so so nothing that ever sticks around long, but id love to get to try them in a place like this.
❤❤❤ massive fan of yours.   and good to see roman atwood there. fan of his since forever ❤
That’s a lot of testosterone!
I love the snowed in episodes. Can't wait for the next one already
Looks like the skies on the Snow rail need to be longer and wider to keep the front end up on the Snow
Yes everybody was in the video cboys to whistlin and Roman 🙏🏻
thats literally how every auction site works they just dont extend the time its smart to wait till the last possible second especially if you have great internet
Robby laymen looks like Clancy wiggans
Stay safe in the bird man. Rad seeing cboys invited out this year
The squad!! All the boys and all the toys. So good.
next level awesomeness! 😄
You guys need to invite Braydon Price out next time and great video.
Sick!
So how many subs do i need to be worthy to earn an invite to this absolute glory of a time?
What would be the modern version of having this on a DVD
Id love to fly with him and help with rescues. I could help in medical since.but i live why to far away.
Nobody should be allowed to have that much fun, lol, great vid.
What a great time it must be.  Glad to see Robby Layton there.
Amazing
Cleeter only know go big or go home!!!!!!!  The giraffe loves him some right pedal!
Need to be there
"We have so much diversity here" says one of 30 white guys. LOL!
Awesome good guys just having all the fun
The muscle is my hero
I'm sure you are all being very conscious of your carbon footprints right?  LOL.  Where is the other Dave?
That was fun!!!
Cool seeing Robby Layton there, he’s an awesome dude
This would be so much fun. You guys are just pretty damn crazy and a good way. Clitus definitely knows where the loud petals at.
Snowed in is so cool .it's cooler than hitting the lottery
Best host I've ever seen
I watched Cleetus’s episode of this last night and this one today. Not only is it awesome content, but it is motivation to take life to the fullest! Keep it coming my man!
WD yeah i saw a couple of them crash lmao
C boys whistling, diesel, cleadis McFarland grind hard pluming co
I can't take Roman serious with that duster 😂
That weston chaplin comment was fucked up by roman. It would have been fine if weston was there when he said it but otherwise its just talking shit. Glad cleetus said something.
INCREDIBLE
Awesome
This is anyones dream or at least it is mine. I would do anything to be part of this. I think this is litterally what my paradise looks like if I have to Imagine it.
Gotta great idea for the tracks on Cleetuss snow buggy.  Could apply to any with tracks.
Epic video
It’s Cleetus’ sand rail..
Much wider skis and some wider tracks and that thing would be quite awesome
Hands down, the best youtube of the year for a few seasons running is Snowed In. I don't usually say anything, but thank you for this epic entertainment.
Awesome video as always
Who was the cool guy who made the winch and chain comment about westen... not cool
Whole lotta Bromance at the cabin .. 🤘
Good shit
Best collab ever.
all I can say when I see this is hell yeah
Larger skis and wider tracks and she won't be so prone to getting stuck.
Little fucked up talking about a man’s weight like that
Next year you got to get the boys from grind hard plumbing and Edison motors to come out
Cboys in the house!!!
your team builds crazy machines!!!
Epic!!!!!
Heavy D needs to purchase a chinook just saying that would be a lot cooler if he did. Ultimate recovery vehicle
I'd love the opportunity to go have fun like that.
I’m glad you guys buried the hatchet since the issue from that race @ The Freedom Factory.
This video is was dreams are made of
What a wonder land. So badass
Saying this video is Epic would be an understatement! It's way past Epic just not sure what you would call that!!!! Paradise in the powder!!!!
That’s was so good,Heavy your good man You entertain so many friends
So Sick...Much Love to everyone there...
5:55 Cleetus with the good moral standing!!
Getting to attend a snowdin event with all the high profile youtubers would be a dream come true!
I want to be a camera guy 😁, I only need $50k a year, I watch everyone's YouTube channels and this looks fun as hell
You’ll have to get the song treetop flyer from Stephen stills. It’s kool.
It really is the like the avenger youtuber edition, this is awesome
So snow buggy sucks cuz it’s not like a snow,aching at all, ratio of body to skis and body to tracks and skis to tracks is not right. But still cool AF
Way to Go ......Fun in the snow.....with them toys😊😊 build a snowman ⛄⛄
maaan these are the best videos
Damn 1.6M for a BlackHawk that’s pretty cheap.
What engine is in the Snow Rail ??? Love that sound.
Should have had demo Matt out
And just like that a whole new sport is born.
EPIC  !!!!! Dave Sparks & Cleetus TOGETHER ... on snow = Broken Internet, or mind ,Whichever comes 1st // maybe BOTH 🤣🤣🤣
this is going to be the best collab ever
Wow way to much fun for sure.
by buddy you mean Cleet
A buddy of mine is looking for a Blackhawk...... hmmmm it has to be Han's for sure. Definitely Han's not Cleetus, Han's  LoL
Honestly this is the coolest thing ever boys! Living the dream being able to do stuff like this
Wow what the F.… is in that snow rail sounds like an old Yamaha Banshee on steroids
ALWAYS Look forward to these vids every year.. love you guys all are awesome
yes, I am jealous. they are the winners because they have the most toys.
What an AWESOME video guys!!! Thanks!!!
What an incredibly frustrating, but utterly effing badass machine! Lol! It just needs a wider track, and a hard start track pre-load type uh giddy-up... Cuz stock sled tracks ain't cuttin the mustard! Sweet action! Lets see WAY more sled-neckin in the next videos! :-)
Very cool that would be the best time...
What a crew to be with. So awesome. Cleetus is a savage lol
I’m a big Robby Layton fan and he didn’t even mention this on his channel yet. You’re a great guy Dave, for bringing these guys in on this adventure!
This would be so much fun to do.
Wheres disel dave!!?? Did u guys break up??
Happy to see the Cboys got an invite!
Awesome ❤❤
Cleetus is getting a Blackhawk
18:54.   Lol Heavy D says “I’m gonna fill your hole in” Not sure why, but how he said it cracked me up
That was awesome guys
Did anyone notice the loose strap on the tail of your Blackhawk, 1:26 into the video right side of screen?
L Roman Atwood for that comment about Westen
Epic video.  Awesome calab with everyone but man, cleetus is a hard act to follow!
I imagine in a thousand years time, some paleo-videographer is reviewing this footage, just thinking "Our ancestors must have lost their minds from breathing all those exhaust gases in the atmosphere"
The most epic trip with an epic group of humans
Heavy D is a great host.
🇵🇱Poland
Love diesel Brothers and cleet collabs. Get to watch the pure savagery from two perspectives 🤘
Dudes will watch this and be like “hell yeah” and I did in fact go “HELL YEAH”
This is the best series of the year
So awesome to have that many toys just to have fun with family and friends this is epic can't wait to see more videos like this
6:30 thats how auctions around us are . My dad and I use that extend technique. Can definitely get it cheaper doing it. Drag it out until 11-12 pm .
Need to do a sweepstakes to have fans cone up and play for a weekend with yall
Nice Cletus is getting a black hawk
The snow rail needs bigger and wider tracks and wider longer skiis in the front.
what a great idea, as a photographer i hope you have some good photographers at the location, the jump of cleetus to take a photo like this is the ultimate dream photo !
I wished these vlogs were 1+long
Can't wait to see cleetus black  hawk
Now will it water skip? Lol
19:58 hes a big snowcat guy now so he can groom the trails like those eyebrows 👀
Damn! Heavy D is a real life Bruce Wayne he's buying all the heavy duty or military vehicles just for fun like they're toys wow and Cleetus's jump were Fantastic 🔥🤘👏
Love you guys cboustv roman Atwood Ohio boy 4 life, disel brothers!!
Who's doing all the cooking for that  crew?
How come Matt from Demo Ranch didnt get invited..cz the whole gang is here..
Getting my cboys fix from Dave sparks. Awesome!!!
Been waiting all year for this series can’t wait to see more!!!!
🤟🏻💚🤟🏻
So sick, keeps you on the edge, need more .  Thank you for all your videos.   Can't wait for the next one.
Crazy video, I love it. It is literal gold Keep up the good work on 1:26 it looks like something is hanging loose on your blawk hack on the right in the picture
That blackhawk is the absolute best color you could have picked!  Also I must say this is the most money I have ever seen in a single youtube video...
I bet Cleetus is getting a Blackhawk 💯💪
I love how Cleetus brought you all these guys together for the races and now they have become great friends and the content that comes from their hang out sessions is friggin’ epic!   It’s cool to see them building each other up instead of shitting on each other for views. So cool.
More CBoys next episode!
Sweet 🤠….Loved this content
Yet another group of guys that has learned how to turn their lives into a nonstop holiday!!! Congrats
We want Hillbilly. He is the man
Jacknife, Like and sub!  Their cool!!! 🇺🇲🤘🤘😎🤘🇺🇲
dave fcku n yours freinds..... havin all that fun fck ..lolol ABSULUTE AWSOME cant wait for part 2...🚁❄
Were did whistlin desil and i think westin, were were they
Is this the Cleetus show? Or heavyD’s channel? Haha
I commented the same thing on Cleetus’ but I hope you realize you guys created a whole new genre of off-roading! I bet there will be a bunch of guys running sand rails in the snow next season!
Awesome, again
This channel badly needs a editor
This is rich
Can Dave and Cleetus fly the Blackhawk together without the Veteran pilot?
Chinook.   Just think about it, could take toys with you, carry everyone, heavy lift for recovering.....
Snow rail needs wider tracks
The entire time I’m watching Cleetus running that “Snow Rail” I’m picturing it with a front tub extension set up similar to a snowmobile making a HUGE benefit to keeping that front end from getting buried so easily as well as reduce any drag from down force friction. I’m picturing the tub actually moving up and down with the suspension somehow. Also, some sort of stabilizing snow deflector/high fender design to keep the snow from loading up the engine and passenger compartment. There is definitely a formula to making that whole concept work beautifully and I don’t doubt the wheels are already turning in all those fabricating brains in the group. 👍🏻😎👍🏻
Sparks just bought a second Blackhawk,  wonder who's in mind for pilot and 2nd ?
Previous video.....Cleetus, "i don't know why i need to be Blackhawk certified, but here we are".  This video.....Dave, "i have a buddy that wants one........bam, i got it...Blackhawk bid win."
Its gonna be 40°c (about 106°f) and around 85% humidity where i am in Australia today (its 7am and aready over 30°c)......Ill swap you in one second flat. That snow looks sooooooooooooooo nice! I am beyond envious!
I would be humbled knowing I had friends, especially friends like you guys. This was a great video, the mountains, the trees, the snow, the amazing company.  Oh, and chocolate milk baby oh yeah, lol.
No such thing as jumping to far, only testing for fatigue or part failure. 😂
Just weird selling Robby Layton in these videos, he just doesn’t fit. The odd one out 😂
This video is 100% proof that you become the average of your 5 closest friends.
Ad heavy
The YouTube premium black hawk
Idk like it was ok but u have even there from ctboys an all u filmed was a sand rail that was kinda lame tbh 🤷‍♂️
Can’t wait for tomorrow!
1:22 1 goose away from shutting down YouTube
holy shit, when i dream about heaven, this is actually what it looks like!!!!
Live in south MN. We dont get powder like that....
Wow what an amazing group of YouTubers having a cool and fun time!! Just one thing missing Demolition Matt!!
MOAR
All the toys.
So Awesome!!!!
This is efing awsome! :)
🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼
You guys should do snow rail racing like trophy truck racing. Hard packed track with some gnarly jumps.
E P I C  !!!
Cool group of people I just wish Cody wasn't there
Snowed in is for sure the greatest series of all time… just one episode in and im already hyped for next year…
These are the type of friends I’d have if I wasn’t a fatherless coward insecure asshole. Im trying tho. I need a mentor for sure.
Invite me I want to play please
Sick video again! Even better as last year, you Guys keep getting us amazed
1 minute in and this video already broke the internet
Right on! Christ protect you all!
I would watch 100 episodes of SNOWED IN. Keep them coming. Incredible
Biggger the horse power the wider the tracks need to be.
👍
Surprised to see Layton without Hillbilly. Looks like a blast.
Epic trip fellas,Heavy D is a legend
Monster Max in the backcountry should be interesting
Just think of the net worth of everyone on this mountain. 🤯
I am still wanting to challenge Heavy D / David Sparks and Diesel David to a arm wrestling challenge and a Tug-of-war don't be a chicken I also will take on Hans as well I really love your alls video's but I know that you all will not win the challenge
"the muscle" is such a tool, dude only shows up when there are other famous YouTubers around. Is he still scamming people with his money schemes
All these guys living their best lives! Friends, family fun and toys lol
CBOYS!!
This series is the best thing on YouTube thank you Dave and the guys!
Wish I was....
These videos are sick 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Snowed IN 2024, HELL YEAH!
Couldn't you just put bigger tracks and skis on the sand rail? Wouldn't that make it way better?
Wow that freaking looks soo awesome! You guys get to have the greatest times!
Guys, I don't know what to say!!!!   Thanks so much for bringing us along!!!!  Awesome content!!👍
Ok that was good tv
Here's your dervisity...is see alot of swinging Richards..but no ussy!
All of you dare devil guys are every mother's nightmare!  LOL!  First time I have heard that Sparks is a bad influence.
THIS IS LITERALLY THE BEST CONTENT POSSIBLE...HANDS DOWN!!!
Love these snowed in series! Keep them coming!
Thats just great fun you all need a little down time and fun.
Hans being Cleetus's concierge getting him choc milk and cookies and e85!  Chefs kiss
I'm seeing Monster Max in the back of everyones videos, I'm waiting to see what kinda dumb shit Cody does lol and Ben wasn't kidding, this is like the Avengers of top tier creators lol
Man that was amazing thanks Dave
Is that Roman with the kinda mean comments? It would suck if it was
Wow. What a weekend this would be. Every toy you would want in the snow. Thanks again for sharing with all of us. Be safe. 😊
Stoked to see Cboys there and of course Cleeter and Roman.
That was amazing. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I look forward to this series every year. Such a cool event
Are you sure you shouldn't have brought the other helicopter since it's a medical evac helicopter?
That thumbnail though…🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Sweet
I challenge anyone to provide a link to a more epic adventure with more epic people than this.
You guys just made my day.  This was so fun to watch.
Go Bills!
Sweet video. Awesome to see all the guys there. Gonna be some sweet upcoming vids.
SWEET looks like a snow globe
You guys really need to get grind hard plumbing co out there.. they got some awesome toys. it would be a great video
Makes me miss the winter of 97 in Alabama all the brother and ladies snowed in at a buddies place with a sail boat in the front yard .  Love it D!
what a trip that would be!
Roman Atwood calling out Westin
Bro i am in duck creek utah and there is non stop snow
Epic! Always been a dream to do stuff like this with buddy’s! Keep kicking ass!
Been waiting for this to drop finally 🙏🏼👏🏻
This is by far the best series on YouTube
Dave brings out 50 borrowed toys and one cool build and thinks he's king 💩. I'd take any other one of them lads fleet over heavys...whatever ge actually even owns....😂
Couldnt wipe the smile from my face that entire episode, what you guys are doing is fantastic. Super Super keen to see more of this, Cleetus can drive anything the guy is a weapon!!!   Hopefully we see you all in the great land down under!
That slowmo looked terrible.
Best video I have seen in a long long time!!! Freakin awesome!!!
Cleetus just treated it like its his drag cars give it everything its got
Unreal, could you imagine having all those toys to play with 😍😎
I guess Matt Carriker is not big time enough to play with the big boys in the Snow. All the ones who show up on Matt Carriker channel is here, but I guess every does not think a Texan can survive the snow.🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣
Best content on the net!
Nice place dave
Most epic thumbnail eeeevvvvveeerrrr!
There ain't many things that makes me jealous, but this experience they're having here does!
comment for the alg, here from cleets channel, greets from belgium!
This is the Greatest all guys in the snow having fun video Ever! No one died a Hero though.
Best series ever. Can't wait for More
I love the cboys so much they are so awesome
Absolutely Epic !!!!! Can never go wrong with Cleeter and Dave !!!
Very cool!
love the snowed in series just the best fun and content
Hanns !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!should start a personal assistant school, he is the best at his craft by far .
Hey what’s up bros how y’all doing much love
These are great 💪
AWESOME!!
Something is loos in the tail, have u seen that? At 1:29
The ultimate in "boys and their toys", so epic.
I really like the Cleetus collaboration s
This is absolutely crazy. Love it!!!
Wow you boys sure live the life , one of the best videos yet , so is that black hawk for cleetus ?
glad to see the Cboys getting recognized as the best of the best.
"A buddy of mine wants a black hawk". We all know Cleetus Freedom Hawk is incoming
Love seeing the cboys 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Amazing!!! All you guys together is always a great time!!!
My favorite series on YouTube by far! 💪🏼🤘🏻🇺🇸 I hope and pray that one day I might get the chance to fly in a black hawk 👊😎🇺🇸
money really changed roman for the worse, now hes just cringe trying to be a blue collar boy, hes just a predator in actuality
I love the idea that there's a good chance one or more of these guys will survive the apocalypse.
Nice to see Hunter there
Dam it boy that is fun
🔥
Ha ya that's impressive
Lot of muppets under one roof😂
Should have invited Grind Hard Plumbing out with their Hayabusa snow bike conversion.
Absolutely love this series
As someone who maintained 60's for over a decade, that tail gear box fairing having an unsecured fastener drives me nuts.
Just a bunch of boys has got to play with toys have fun guys
was not expecting Robby Layton up here!
Shit c….
Where is the Grindhard crew?!
I know most liked the snow machines adventures and the jumping or even the blackhawk helicopter but i got deja vu fever just seeing the log cabin. i thought i walked into my parents loghouse, definately built by the same group of people.
AGAIN JUST SHOWING OFF HIS MONEY.....
Wow, awesome. Looks so fun.
What a ridiculously high quality video! WOW! Some of those shots were completely epic and so well put together. Thanks for all the effort, glad to see you sneak some fun in. 😂🤣😂
what a life
This is amazing to bad I'm not a youtuber
Pretty sure Hans has a crush on cleetus
Lots of Epic Content from these Men. Thank You to everyone.
I hope this series goes viral/trending and is talked about for a long time! EPIC!!
It has been decades since I have played in snow. Never did we get that much but I  miss it. It would be cool to be up there.
snow rail = SNAIL
That looks like a lot of fun
Boys toys so cool. They must make a shitload of money. Good for them
Awesome video  Where is diesel Dave?
To much money
Another BS thumbnail. Reported.
Use all the people you have met up with
Cleet the SAVAGE
awesome series.. love it.
Definitely need to figure out a way to keep the snow out of snow rail. Fenders or a way to deflect. Maybe a type of enclosure for cab, then you could run a heater. Pampered life would be better. Lol
In the words of sniping soup, "just a couple guys being dudes, couple dudes being guys."
Great video, bringing your buddies in in your Blackhawk is a major flex 👍🏻
This is epic!
Cleetus, I could make some custom rear fenders for the rail to keep that snow under control.
Which ever person said you got a winch on that thing about Westen thats mean. Thats messed up. Jokingly or not.
Just awesome, awesome people hanging out, having fun and doing awesome stuff.
You got everyone topped with the black hawk! Let's just take a minute to appreciate what a down to earth guy you are, your buddy with the long beard I see with you also has a tremendous heart! God bless you! Such a great friend, and to offer assistance in so many situations, very impressive at the least! Your one of the best! Keep moving forward!
I love this series so much
This is the best time of year!! Minus politics 😂
Great video!  I was skiing at Beaver Mountain, which is just on the other side of the valley, and I think I heard Cleetus going up the hill!
Cboys! No snow in Minnesota... Or mountains. Awesome video everyone.
Hurts because i keep thinking of Ken. I hope youre all staying safe.
i bet the other black hawk he said a "buddy" wanted it , its going to be Cleetus lol
The snow rail needs bigger tracks and more gears.
You guys always go on my birthday week. I'm so jealous! Have fun boys!
@sparks the snow rail needs bigger feet in the front. more surface area keep it up on the powder. awesome vid bro
BADAZZ!!! Where is Westen???
Hell, I thought last years gathering at the cabin looked like the most amazing time!  I dunno tho, after this opening video it's lookin like this year is shaping up to blow it outta the wat.. er snow!
I love seeing my favorite youtubers just having fun! cant wait to see the next episode!!
the dig t at westen was a bit uncalled for
Cleet sittin down eating some cookies and chocolate milk was great
well now we know what the new cboys vid is going to be
hi guys,Iam a french canadien from quebec city ,lots a snow here,not that mush lol,whats better to be with the gang in snowmobiles crasy and no women to hahaha,I cant do that no more I had a accident who got me paralize,Ienjoy whached the video thank ,waiting for par 2
Thank you Dave. This is just an awesome snow experience. Really like this you-tubers gathering, having fun, do keep it save.
Does drag and drive count if you were to carry your El Camino with a black hawk to each event? 😬
Clets face when he got to the top is just epic
The YouTube Bilderberg Meeting
Simple guess… 5.2 million in toys out there?
roman atwood is a groomer
Have an awesome trip, and try not to break yourselves. Equipment can be replaced, and bones take time to heal.
Reminds me of the blackhawks that crashed in Snowbird 2 years ago.
I wonder if Dave and Cletus can fly by themselves now. Soon to be Dave and Dave it sounds. I would say one day for myself but that would be BS lol
Where are they hiding all the race fuel, diesel, and gas?
characters!...fun!
I'm glad some people get to live the dream!!!
Atleast if someone gets hurt you can fly them to a hospital quickly
Where's the video on the r1 on tracks
Are you guys all Mormon. Dang . Didn't see one beer or bong rip. Not that you should be f'ed up with helicopters and horsepower.
Snowrail needs wider tracks. Probably should just stick to groomed trails.
Some of the best videos I have watched man. Makes me so pumped  to be subbed to most or all of of you guys. Huge inspiration to me man fr
I love watching these and seeing all my favorite YouTubers together having a blast! If possible you guys should try and do a summer one as well! I’m sure all of us would love that too!
Too much fun guys!
love seeing grown men living the dream
Think I know wants the 60.......
With Cleetus having just taken his blackhawk licens, what is the chances his getting a blackhawk
Totally spelled the beans on the Blackhawk
Now Cleetus needs to get seat time in the brodozer
What a great guy freaking legend doing this for his buddies
What sucks is i follow all these mfs....so now i have a list to watch 😂🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
I PROFESIONAL
Dave just ready and willing to just drop 1.5 mil on a helli.  Me buying gas to get to work-😬😮‍💨 welp now im broke.
5:55. Props to @cleatus for stepping up for @weston
Hahahaha broooo that shit was so dope an exciting to watch I didn't want it to end lol Damn I live in Utah an it didn't snow much down here this year 😢 I'm  disappointed 😅
H D I am from the tropics Jamaica never see r touch  the snow before but ever year I watch you I wich a day will come and I get to US have to come and watch you guys if u permit me bro I love watching
So Cleetus is trying to get a Blackhawk. He just got the license...
what a series to start the year
That looks so fun
buddy looking for a Black Hawk == Cletus?
Why would he thing Cleetus lawn dart with most of the weight being in the back? 😂
My uncles cabin! Always a good time being up there!
If they invited Mr. beast he would be like "On this Episode we are buying a Mountain" 😂
Casually Spending $1,6 M on a Black hawk so casually is the literal Definition of  Financial Freedom and abundance, Super motivated to work hard and Smart to reach Such heights
I'm so jealous this whole video looked so much fun.
how is demo not there?!?
"Trapped" in the mountains as they take a Blackhawk to the their spot
This experience must be the coolest thing ever. You’re an absolute legend for setting all this up Dave!!!
Soo sick. Come flying in on a blackhawk. Thats the most badass thing you could do. 😂
Now I know why women live longer
Must be nice
Im waiting to see how stuck monster max gets
I blocked cletus from youtube,  get rid of him.
I don't even live near snow and I want a Klim one piece suit....
Dude I just want to see monster max play...  please
Playing in the snow, EXtreme. AGO.Bro., edition 😮. Everyone should have a go-pro to record their fun here. 😀 I can imagine I'm being there with a go-pro. 🙃
I actually agree Bro, Dave is a Good bad influence cause it almost seems like I want each and every toy that could possibly be used for fun and stupid adrenaline stuff...!!!!❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❄❄🌍
what a perfectly placed eagle boost overhang. gosh dang brother!
Absolutely love these snowed in episodes!! This would be the most fun and best time, period!! So much fun to watch!
Wow epic for sure!
I can't wait for the rest of these. The snowed in series videos are just killer!!  Dave ain't fooling anyone.. that Blackhawk has got to be for Cleeter 😂🤘🤘
Hope everyone stayed safe. Lets never forget ken block.
Whistlin Diesel shouldn’t be there.  He is a terrible person.
The snow rail needs wider tracks
I wonder how a very big set of paddles would do in the snow
So sick y’all brought the cboys out they have worked so hard man
Sooooo freak’n awesome!! Man..
I love this every winter! You guys need a summer boating trip with all the guys!
So is whistling diesel the group snowflake? It’s the only reason I could see him in this group
You guys are living everyone's best life
18:50 “I’m gonna fill your hole in” is wildddd

SICKINGLY AWESOME HIGHT THE DEATHRAIL OR DEPTHRAIL😝😆😅😂🤣TAKEN FIGHT☠️☠️☠️☠️
"Snowed In" is one of my Favorite series

Who ever  was clowing on Weston is a pos. Props to cleet for immediately sticking up for him.

Casually bids 1.62 million dollars whyle chomping down on tacos, epic.
it looks nice yall are the best and stay safe and best of all have fun and stay safe spark boys and congrats on the new blackhawk
I dunno. Feb 3, 1959.  Never put that much talent in one flyer.  But dang what a sweet time there!
Petition to make cleetus get a fucking rode and a real camera to film on my god it’s worlds of difference. I know George been working out
Enclosed cab on the snow rail coming soon.
I'm guessing that friend would be Looking for a blackhawk would probably be garrett mitchell
You are an awesome guy D.Sparks
Don t show CLEETUS that rear camera angle! I caught myself "flying" DA BLACK HAWK...... LOVE IT.....PLAYING WITH TONKA TOYS!
So awesome to see so many good people getting together and having a blast
But shitty throwing shade on Western, he has equal subs compared to Heavy D and Cleetus.
So cool seeing all my favourite channels having a blast! Awesome vid for real! Made my day!!
wish I had friends like you and all the guys! Great stuff!😉
Some snow flaps on that snow rail would do the trick!
What could  possibly go wrong?    Epic vid
Very very cool,,you guys are incredible,,😮
Sounds like cleetus is getting a Blackhawk 👀
I cant think of a single thing to go wrong.......
At 1:30, something is loose and flapping on the helicopter tail. Or is that supposed to be like that.
what a trip for the books
These snowed in episodes are the best ever! I look forward to these each winter! Keep up the awesome videos you guys are killing it!!!
love ❤ it , need all the content, wish i were there 😢 you guys be sure to have a blast ya deserve it
Ol cleeter is about to have a black hawk it sounds like
Bruh, im from Baltics started no skill no boost;no biches; no oil pressure...my boy picked me up for some 8pool in hes 5series bmw manual 3.0disel 160kw....  After the 35km sideways whocares drive he told me live a little like diesel brothers.
Sooooooo pleased/surprized to see Robbie Layton. He never takes time to play. Congrats Robbie on making the list.
Cleeter, Whistling, and Sparks. You need nothing more. Man, I love this series and when these guys get together.
Heavy,would you please through the worlds biggest sliding party,no motor vehicles, just Runner sleds toboggans red Pasta sleds. Intertubes type sleds with air and a air mattresses,on the long hill Garrett climbed in his video.Groom it So it's all Freshly groomed to quarteroid conditions. I think it would be the world's biggest YouTube club and the world's biggest sliding party. All-in-one and yes, alcohol should be there because there should be no motorized vehicles there. I know it's a lot of paperwork for people to sign. But imagine the views you would get
Stay happy my brothers
Granted you guys get the snow  but bring your  butts to the upper peninsula of Michigan in the snow belts in sub zero temperatures and play lol😅 man up lol
Awe, come on Heavy don't leave us hanging.
Loving the calabs of my favorite creators. And inspiring videos.
A buddy of his = Cleetus lol
Wow so much fun
freaking Epic Stuff Guys !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wouldn't of let anyone out of that black hawk until those blades stopped spinning from the cameras point of view it looks like there only maybe 10 inches over Robby's head . Seems dangerous
bidding on another blackhwak for a buddy....  hmmm who else just got a license? lol
Honestly other than Dave, WD, and Cletus I’ve never heard of the other creators. Looks like all had a good time so far.
I want to see whistlindiesel corrupt robby Layton lol. Robby is just so nice and looks like a good boy. Cody needs to corrupt him lol
Soooo whens Cody getting a Blackhawk?!?!
YO HEAVY TELL CLEETUS HE SHOULD RENAME IT "DEATHRAIL" OR "DEPTHRAIL"😈😁
You guys are the shit what a blast i love the snow
Look forward to this every year. You all are living the dream and taking us along.
I don’t want this to ever end
So Hans only hugs Giraffes. Got it.
Yall need to invite grind hard plumbing they are done real amazing guys like the rest of you
Back at the cabin for another year
The Spark's brothers  and gang are hard to guard at all times ! If I were in trouble I would hope they were the first to show up !
This over in Montana?
That looked fun 👌👌
These videos need to be at the very least, 1 hour full of epicness! Love these dudes!
The Blackhawk needs some skis
I love the fact that your so upfront of how much things you buy cost. 1.6m for a blackhawk is wild to hear! Congrats man! hell yeah
MR. D I NEED A RE'EDIT WHEN THE RAIL HIT'S ITS PEAK WE NEED A BALD EAGLE TALKING LIKE A BIG DOG SINGING THAT CLEETER TOON THAT WE KNOW AND LOVE RE/EDIT PLEASE!!
Put some air bags on the bottom of the beast .exat. is a good thing .
I'm sooooo glad that the Cboys are getting invited out to this stuff! They totally deserve it. I've been following them since before covid and they 100% are one of the most genuine and funny groups on youtube!!
Now all they need is Grind Hard Plumbing Co. up there and the "Avengers" team is complete.
Your Snowed In is the most epic wildest snow and toy extravaganza ever to take place on this planet!!
Where's diesel dave
Love this video, that's the ultimate grown mans playground!
You know who you really should get out there?   Colinfurze.
Epic

18:51  “I’m gonna fill your hole in”
What happen you don't have the outdoor hot tub this year LOL! Man I'm so jealous I would love to have a place like that and love your cabin that is killer I have a summer place on Lake Huron that I go to in the summer that I go every weekend it has a private beach with my own dock I have a boat and 3 waverunners. My friends come out and bring their family and we go fishing and water skiing and tubing and i go out in the winter sometimes to go ice fishing but I need a place like that for the winter I just don't have any big hills or mountains it's mostly flat around here.
snowed episode 1 (for the 3rd time)
This episode reminds me of the Jake Paul and Logan Paul episode from 2022. Such an awesome time, keep em coming boys!!
Man you guys do the wildest stuff!! Hope I get the chance someday to hang with y’all for at least a day! You’re my type of people!! Great video as always fellas
Nothing like belly landing a BlackHawk. 🤘🤘🤪
Awesome vid! Love these mountain cottage videos!
Whistlindiesel / Cody could have been using your help with that dozer. Looks like getting a hauler was a nightmare for him thw  having to dismantle it all too absolute nightmare. Can't believe they didn't check the air intake before they started a fire under it for hours 😳  that thing would have fired right up
Probably one of the coolest machines and jumps I’ve seen in the snowed in series or just in general. That was badass
Didn’t know baby giraffes were allowed too fly
c-boyz!
Best TV on here lolllĺ
Love the snowed in episodes!!! The snow rail is epic….
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MINNESOTA WILD BABY!!! lets go cboys, they be wild at
FLORIDA BOYS ARE THE CRAZIEST!LOL
The snow rail needs some fenders and wider skis for the real deep powder!! 🚗💨🇺🇸🦅
Crazy how I discovered all these YouTubers then they start to hangout together these videos are so cool. Love the cboys love Roman been watching him the longest. Love cleetus been watching him for a long time too.
You need to set Cleater up with some wider tracks and wider front ski on the snow rail and it will be money.
Keep ‘em coming. You’re living the dream for all of us froze in.
As a day of 5 kids what I would give for a stress reliever vacation like that 😂😂
I was wondering if you could build a snow plow for an electric wheelchair.
Cool. I've seen every one produced... I especially loved the HOT TUB. This  is redneck stuff without the alcohol induced stupid stuff..
Every video is just a new goal for the boys. Love this series! And it never ceases to amaze me how everyone is all snow geared out and you're just in a hoodie 😂
A weekend snowed in like that with all the toys.  Wow that would be a blast 💜💜
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Sheesh! Sick trip boys!
Rich boys and their toys.   With no regard to the costs of when they break something.     Must be nice to be young and stupid 😂.
Absolute dream living that life, thanks for sharing!
Witlistdesel by like I bought a Blackhawk without a permit
EPIC!!! ❤❤
3:40 PAlMER ? my last name
Please 🥺🥺
Please 🥺🥺
I knew I’d see the cleetus is getting a Blackhawk comments 😂
Ask Brandon price to come
Ken Block would have been a great invite. RIP.🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪
My favorite content of the year! Magical things happen when you have so many personalities together and so many toys to play with.
I love these episodes. When I lived in Scandinavia i had a snowmobile but now i live in a warmer country with not so much snow. But one day i will buy another one. Have a blessed week.
You guys. probably never get cold cause you're Testosterone is just pumping.😅😅😅
Living the dream, boys.  Thanks for sharing it.
How much is that property I think they rent it? I'd like to buy that property just to hang out with them I wouldn't even charge them rent for that week! :)
I dunno how you did it. But literally every YouTube I watch is in this group
Yo Dave FYI the tie down on the left  tail  hold down which looks like it's loose yo😮😊
The cooling fans are packed with snow😂😂 on the buggy
This is the Future 😎🤘🏼☀️☀️
Omg lmao that's was amazing 😍❤😮
We neeed to get this video to #1 on trending
That snow rail is a deathtrap.
Funny shit !
The snow rail gets stuck because it's tracks are to skinny
Thumbnail is such clickbait 😂 looks like something Eddie hall would come up with.
There’s YouTubers with 2 million subs that just watch TV on their channels that haven’t moved out of their parents house yet…
Anything Heavy D and I'm in. ❤
love it
So cliter bought one.
To hear all these grown man giggle like little kids...priceless!!!
Where is Dave?
I am guessing a small block v8 in that Cletus mobile!
so much fun having you guys got a little bit of heven there
O snap Dave just told Cleetus secret he's getting a black hawk so if we see Cleetus trying to sell a CPL toys then we know for sure keep your  eyes open people
Should've fast-roped the boys in from the chopper 😂
Comment for a kick butt Cleetus full send on a "Snow Rail" prototype. The Sparks crew did an awesome job fabricating those bad ass, one of a kind and TOUGH set of tracks.
I love the boys!!! Cormorant boys!!!
This was epic and watching this I realized this is why men die young lol, play hard guys 👍
Solid Hoonigan style! ❤ KB4ever
Nice work, if you can get it.
Does it have a winch? Hahahaha omg that's fucked up but so funny
This is how I wanted to my future to be as a 10 year old, just unlimited toys
One of you should own a starting fluid company!
Cletus is awesome
Dude - You bought another BH !!!!!   EPIC.
He trying to see block
havin one UH-60 is awesome but two ! DANG
Next move after the Blackhawk will straight up be a Chinook that they'll use for hauling a vehicle and 50 people up to the cabin. Gotta get some air lift content with the Blackhawk, like showing us what it can hook and transport.
So Kool to have so many famous Youtubers all together in one place to have fun. Makes great content. Keep it up guys!!!!
Great video 🔥
Thanks for the content
Freakin insane! Gotta love the boys coming together!
Layton nation !!
Where is Diesel Dave????
This is truly one of my favorite series! I look forward to snowed in!
"My Buddy" wants one... Hmmm. 🤔🦒
nice video
Tracks?....... We put that shit on everything. DAVE.... How about putting tracks and a power train on a helo????  Start small with a fecod..... Then with an all out helicopter !!!
If it goes well, absolutely brilliant…. But if the black hole goes down shit, I’ll lose most of my favourite YouTube channels… is it a risk that should be taken?
I figured Cletus was getting a Blackhawk. Why else would he be taking training classes for one?
This is epic i cant wait to see the next episodes!
So glad to see Roman came!!!
Yessss dude!!!! all my favourite YouTuber in the same video hell yea brother  Cletus, Roman,c boys with Cody best thing ever !! Never thought I would see it
This all sounds very much like Flight 571
You know with this series you have all my favorite Youtubers can’t wait to see what Winston, Whistlin diesel and supercar Ron are going to be doing though
Nothing better than this! Period~ Can't thank you enough for all these incredible feats of engineering & creativity... Bringing us all along to watch makes it EPIC!
How are these videos so short lol love it though
You're done
MANDELBAUM MANDELBAUM MANDELBAUM
That BlackHawk wouldn’t be for Andy Frisella would it??
The snowed in series is AMAZING!!!
Murphy diesel still read his
Cletus is the man!!!!
Dude! Never go out the nose of a Blackhawk. That is the lowest point of the rotors. Always go straight out from the sides. Even worse with that deep snow and unlevel surface. People have been killed doing that.
Been loving this series. Looks so fun. I miss snowmobiling
Hell yeah
May want to pack that landing areas.
I found a military big transport boat but you don't look at your comments
Which one piece is Cletus wearing?!
❤❤❤
Your going to need another cabin up there lol 👍👍💚
The ski's on the front of the snowrail need to be about a foot longer and 4" wider. It would really help it keep from burying itself.
That buddy better be cleetus!
If Westen Champlin joins this might go down in history as one of the best collaborations ever
is cleetus looking for that blackhawk
I’m surprised Dave doesn’t have ski’s for the Blackhawk.
Dave is Lazer focused yea😂 high on life
wow
Cleetus getting a Blackhawk 🤔
hell yeah
I love when all you guys get together and tear it up....
Been looking forward to this series.  Thank you, everyone nvolved❤
This is the series I love almost the most
Which “buddy of mine”? @ 4:26
Is that your cabin that was buried? Do you have the episodes of you fixing your cabin?
Doug and a few of the sxs blog guys would be cool to see here too. Pretty full house I'm sure.
I feel like I'm there in spirit.  I would give anything to go spend time there with you guys.
Heavy. D man I hate snow an cold u make it look like fun
I bet it’s absolutely awesome being there.
Best series on YouTube
The less dave sparks the better. This was a good vid
Cleetus know the deal fr,, " that was mean, thats my dawg"
I love snowed in.
Man this is my ultimate dream to do this kind of shenanigans with great ppl
awesome
Clete needs fenders on that snow rail.
I want to create a youtube channel just to be invited out to snowed in.  This looks like way too much fun, with way too cool of a crew!
So wholesome. love watching these series :D
Wow.  Didn't expect to see Paul (pilot) in this one.  I figured since Heavy D and Cleetus had their license, we'd just be seeing those 2.  Could imagine seeing a better bunch of people hanging out together.
if you are in Mass i would love to go on your BLACK Hawk ty
Only a mattet of time before one of you ends up crippled or dead. You should involve Whistlin Diesel more.
Coolest thing ever man
boys dream right here !
You got all my favorite Youtubers together
So Sick!!!
I wonder if that friend that wants an blackhalk is garrett?
So after watching this video i have to add a new thing to my bucket list :D wanted to be there from start to the end. awesome video guys.
He did my boy Westin dirty😂
George is such a huge chevy guy, I'd of loved to seen his first reaction to seeing monstermax and getting a ride in it.
Love these snowed in vids...
Remember on the hangover movie when chow jumped off ceaser palace and starts singing that should’ve happened in the part when  he jumped lol
Dave you  are a great guy to do that with your friends
Do it while you can!
Glad Robbie Layton was invited
Snowed Involved is the best YouTube series hands down.
You guys are so brave  awesome
Good stuff
ooh , too cool 😅😊
Epic!!
12:55 it needs double width tracks and much bigger skies.
I GPS'd 167 on my GSXR... On a track...😁
all the channels i watch lets gooo
U can separate the men from the boys by the size of their toys!
So stoked to see the rest of the shenanigans that went on.
I so look forward to these every year. Keep up the great work buddy 👍
The thumbnail is so epic 😮
If the chopper fell out the sky youtube would loose millions 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Need some tracks for monster max
I wish I could go there and hang out with all the ogs of YouTubers
No one needs a Blackhawk-15
These are the best series. I love seeing all of you guys together.
Hydrocarbons are amazing!
A buddy of yours wants a blackhawk... by any chance is he built like a giraffe?
BANGER!!!!!!!!!!!
Loved seeing Robby there!
The cboys!!!! The collab I didn’t know I needed!!!
Cleetus is getting a black hawk 💪
Epicccccc
You guys should do some HDR video.  I'd love to see the contrast on the snow vs everything else.
awsome
This guy us super rich. What does he do foreal foreal?
Heavy u guys have to much fun  to cool😂
167 mph?!? Jeez, I knew Blackhawks were fast, but DAAAAAMN…… Dave, what’s the top speed you’ve gotten her to?
You boys be safe out there remember Ken block
You guys are over the TOP I can’t wait to see you guys in the next!
Look at dis unit.
You’re missing a turn lock on the tail panel boss. Right by where you have the GoPro
I would kill to be out there ripping with cleeter and all these guys! I think when anyone asks who their coolest friend is they respond Dave Sparks hands down! What a blast
This gives me DC mountain lab vibes
Badass series 😊
Just casually buying another Blackhawk at lunch. Another day in Heavy D's life.
Awesome start to the Snowed in Series 🤟
love these videos
Greatest videos you guys put out are these snowed in ones. LOVE THESE!!!
Cleetus or Whistlin’ for the Blackhawk?
4:20 "A buddy of mine wants one", I bet its Cleetus loool
Nice Video People << Thank somebody lol🤷‍♂️✌️✌️
Love the winter video with all of you guys together! I can't think of a single thing that could go wrong! Lol
CHAOS, MADNESS, and JOY beyond words - you all rock it!
So cleetus gets his black hawk licence and immediately tries to fly his sand rail? 😂😂
Dave you should do a day in the life I love that video you should do it
Love this series
This is the best series on the tubes!
A bunch of men with toys, what could possibly go wrong? Loved the video brother
These videos are always the best of the year!
How much yall wanna bet his "buddy" that wants a Blackhawk is our boy ole Cleetus?
Great video
There isn’t a single billionaire in Dubai having more fun than you guys. So awesome. Have fun
Florida man don't know snow...heh
Wait all year for this series it’s one of if not your best!
Epic footage. Well put together video. We'll done editing team,
I can see a All Track Drive conversion in the future.
Buddy named Cleet?
never put in a proxy bid, its rigged the auctioneer bids against u and raises the price to what u bid
So crazy
This video is pure perfecfion. Look forward to it every year!
Yall build the jump I'll pin it to win it lol
Air wolf vibes with that black hawk ❤
Ol cleet cleet out lookin for a black  hawk lol 😂
It's funny how in love Hans is with Cleetus!😂 EVERY TIME 😂😂
Keeping bringing cleeter to all these events he makes it way more fun
So I just seen something wrong with ur helicopter at 1:28 there is something not attached and looks like its broken
Work hard play harder!
Did they notice that there is some type of metal strap loose at the 1:26 mark? I was in an aviation maintenance unit in the service and that would not be let to fly with that being defective.
The crew that built it are really talented 😂
What good is money if you don't have some great friends to enjoy it with? The answer is, the richest man on earth, with 0 friends, is actually the poorest man on earth. Friends and family are worth more then any sum of money
You guys are getting me off my butt and showing me what I can do to become successful. Thanks for all the good work that you do. You deserve this vacation
I couldn't imagine how much fun this would be, stoked for you guys!!
That's got to be the greatest time ever
Where was Dave?
How about a snowed in podcast? 🤔 Thoughts?
I hope to see y’all come through Brigham again soon. I met Dave at 711 when y’all pulled the car out of mantua. Much love.
AMERICA 🇺🇸
gon need a winch for westen champlin 💀💀💀
Does Dave own this cabin?
Exit at the 3 or 9 o’clock position. The front (12 o’clock) is the most dangerous. Wouldn’t want anything to happen. Love the content, keep up the good work.
When Cleetus Jumped the Sand Rail, All I heard was Bald Eagles.
Legit best videos out! I’ve been tuning into all the YouTubers stuff this weekend ready to see the trail ride and what y’all get into. Keep em coming!
Been waiting for this! Finally about time!
robby in the wild good someone got him out the shop
Couldn't imagine what it feels like to be there. CRAZY CRAZY.  you have to have something you need launched jumped held wide open past anyone. Just holler lol😂
I've been looking forward to this! You've got a great crowd up there this year too 😁👍 We don't have snow like this in the UK, I can't even imagine what it's like out there! I am so jealous 😅
hell yha lets goooo
Snowparadise
I'm glad everyone's having fun but please be safe remember rip Ken Block
Buck list item right here. Don’t let even drive anything. At the same time please let him to entertain us 🤣🤣🤣.
can you have 2 much fun? not with this crew
I would love to be a part of the snowed in series but I live in Canada
Y’all are absolutely crazy
Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out fresh snow anything 2 feet deeper you don't go in because you're not gonna make it you're gonna sink it again doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out
I love carnage no matter what trail mater says
I'm impressed Monster Max made it, after what happened in it's last video.  lol
We have the same piston bully, have you been getting engine code 10300 (crank case pressure sensor) for no reason?
If you hang/ hook tarps around the bus engine to the ground.  Then use a heater . The heat will quickly heat the engine.  This is done in northern Canada.
I watched you guys all weekend up there
Cleetus getting a blackhawk... 👀
Cleet needs a Blackhawk you say?
The who's who of you tube..are you kidding?? This is the red carpet of you tube.. probably the most fun watching content out.. good job
Cleeter is the man. 😂
Deez Nutz HA Gottie
"let's meet at the airport, we'll pile in the Blackhawk and fly up to the cabin" then allll those toys up there including a monster truck 🤣 just bananas
A buddy of yours wants a blackhawk....aka cleetus
This is why youtube works
My only complaint- stop talking with your mouth full lol
I love the snow but I hate the cold that comes with it. Lol I am a southern girl. Give me 50s at least with snow. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
this is hands down the most jaw dropping video of the sowed in series yet sick fun times man,its the experience of a life time with amazing people...awesome
I don't know how y'all can stand Cody. He needs to be cancelled. I'm so glad Cleetus didn't put him in his video.
Love it when Cleetus told  Dave  to build a jump, he just immediately says how big.  Doesn’t stop to ask if it’s a good idea, or maybe wait and drive it some first.  It’s a great idea Cleetus.  Love it when these two get together!
Love seeing the Cboys there!
Should have invited Rory…. Bet he can’t go hard enough 😂
This is utube gold ... Thanks Dave ,And all the other creaters
Well except the funny one lol just kidding love you Hans 😂
Every year you put on the awesome events. Bigger and better every time. I fear you may run out of room in the cabin. Might be time to level that up as well.
Alright you got the decent sisters now you need to even worse with Mr. Mullet
Shit so dopeeee..    Even crazy to think Ken block was doing the same thing riding a snowmobile and died 😞
Love it all ... your the best thing on ... but I don't get the attraction with whistling diesel everything that guy says is negative ... the people is this video are the most positive people on the planet BUT THIS LOSER SORRY BUT CALL A SPADE ♤ A SPADE NEVER STOP LOVE FOR ISRAEL BECAUSE GOD WINS 😢
Well I take it back heavy D and Robbie are still good friends what do I know I’m just some sad lonely injured veteran talking shit about people I know nothing about
Some ski's on the blackhawk would be sweet
So cool that you brought all these dope YouTubers together
This is how  the  big boys  are   playing 😊
highlight of the year... 2023 was a looong year.. :D
Wow man keep up the good work.
Those front skis are tiny looking. I'm surprised they didn't break off
Sooo,,, Cleetus is getting a blackhawk????????
Monstermax???
Dude I would love to do this!
Yo y’all leave some 👍,🖖🖖
Love the snowed in series
clout fest is what it should be called, terminal dweeb overload
Cleetus buying a blackhawk

So dope! Come to Canada this summer !
I love this series just when you think you've outdone yourself in the previous years you guys keep stepping it up every year
