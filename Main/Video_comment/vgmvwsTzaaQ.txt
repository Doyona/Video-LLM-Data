I watched this live and am always coming back to this
I still can't believe I just found out 💚🛸
TOMODACHI LIFE MENTIONED RAHHHHHHHHHH
Coming back here on May 6 2025. 3 mos before Iluna's 3rd debut anniversary ❤
Are you really jordan your voice is similar tho
debuting with a really cool original song is insane! and ren’s just naturally amusing and funny 💚
Coooool and the debut song is really amazing!!
8:40の「でも俺からしたら君らの方がエイリアンだよ」で頷いてるのとかなんかわかんないけどそこがめっちゃ好き
めっちゃかっこいい
его голос так изменился
好喜歡你的Blue sugar，它真的很好聽，足以讓我循環播放超過一個月不換歌曲！ 之前沒有追vtuber的習慣，但從今以後我會常駐在你的頻道✨🥰 Long story short, I love your singing! Hope to continue to watch you in the future (hope the reaction is correct🥺
wait why does ren's voice sound not like the ren in the horror game streams ?O_O? edit: never mind that was probably just my imagination
18:54 ayo what's jowol doing here 😭😭
ㅎ
Coming back here and rewatching again~ I dunno. I just love Ren's debut moment, his big day. You're really charming, such a positive person/alien. ^^♡
When re-watching debut streams, I realize how much of a simp chat is-
Eyyyy, fellow water, piano, and dinosaur lover, let’s gooo!!! Never came across anyone who loves water as much as me, so that’s awesome. Favorite VTuber by far. (Even if I can’t catch your streams because work.)
God damn its really been 7 months since they debut... god damn time goes fast
woooo 1K comments!! ❤
Thanks you Alien Prince for coming to earth 💚
왤케 귀여워
😭😭😭
This will never not be a legendary debut stream to me!
Still a great debut ❤ had to rewatch
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
me when guessing what it was in his pocket thingy: *wEeD*
Oh God! You did a very good job on your first stream! I'm proud of you 👏✨
11:01 reimu it's ur time to shine bae✨
He wrote the song?  Insanely good!! His vocal is genuinely a banger
Is it just me or do you sound like sweeto tunes?
If you could be my Punk Rock Prince, I would be your Garage Band Queen~ I'm sorry I don't hear the word punk rock often I HAD to say that 🙃 (although i'm super late for this)
9:20 das cute
Великолепно!
I like Ren Zotto
I like the music u made🎶🎵🤍
Now he is my favorite vtuber

I’m looking forward to listening your new songs.Ren’s song is cool !!!!🛸 I’m Japanese ,so I’m not good at English, but I want to communicate on chat.So I sent messages in English.🌟

Dark magic called anime-
I’m speechless and wish for this alien Prince’s hand in frickin marriage!!! I know I need to get in line but OMG💍  Ok so as far as I can tell are personality’s match so well. He’s Australian and so am I, he doesn’t like superheroes with Spider-Man as an exception just like me, we both hate summer and finally we both hate sports but don’t mind a bit of tennis   Ren bby if you wanna go on a tennis date hit me up~💛
Bro it's crazy how much this cute alien prince has blown up in a matter of eight days
The first thing I thought when I heard “blue sugar high” Was “watermelon sugar high”
9:23
Bruh I've been doing nothing but binge Neil Cicierega for the past three days, instant oshi <3
I know I say I love all the nijisanji members... but this one has actually stolen my heart. PLEASE SIR UNHAND MY KOKORO <3<3<3 But real talk, this was such a lovely and chill intro. I'm looking forward to watching your stuff and hanging out with this crew. Also, I think your goals are inevitable tbh. Like, don't even worry, it'll happen. It's got to, you've got all the tools!
26:43 “My people need me~ brBlbrbrbrblrblblbrbr” AAAHDBSJSBS
22:17 LMAOOOOO WHY IS HE ADORABLE
the fact that we have so many similarities on our likes JDBSJSBS >////<
HIS CHUCKLES AND GIGGLES HDBEJSHS T_____T
Back to the time that I haven't heard your voice yet there's something pushing me to stan you and choose you as my oshi in ILUNA. I think it's a great thing I followed my guts. >< nice to meet you, Ren. 🤍
This is probably the first time that I'm thankful for what the YouTube algorithm recommended to me 😭. I'm a few days late, but congrats on your debut! Also the song is such a bop, I love it!!!
Dislikes: bullies. Likes: Takagi-san and finds it cute. ... wut?
a non depressing backstory? owo
How did nobody notice that he described dogs when he said he liked cats  😭😭😭
damn he has a very nice voice and i am not talking about singing
saw waterparks and was sold
He loves cats. I love him.
Call us Earthlings. Please. I'm begging you.
what a beautiful voice😁
ANIMAL CROSSING LANGUAGE😭😭😭
Im starting to like this guy

顔と声がいい
I LOVE HIM
I'm sorry you can't make the edgiest character on a random alien planet and name him Risotto and then not expect me not to laugh  (I love him but its just so funny to me)
Welcome Ren!

dark magic called anime 😭😭😭😭

Why are you giving me ang wattpad boys vibe I like it but congrats to your debut
GAYYYYYYYYYY
OH MY GOD??
Fan name suggestion: Zorrens ?
Likes music and water, but is not a merman? Missed opportunity
I lost it when he ascended 💀
THE ANIMAL CROSSING SPEECH WAS SO CUTE HAHAHAH
The song's a banger‼️ I wish I saw this yesterday but I wake up at the oddest hours so I never got to watch it live🥹
YOUR SONG IS AMAZING! Is it available on Spotify?
23:25　可愛すぎるkawaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Came from a clip of vox calling this mans zaddy and that song blew me away wth
Honest question, does ren zotto's species normally speak English? Or animal crossing?
Am i just the only one who keeps listening to his debut streams right after listening to BLUE SUGAR?? And keep replaying those vids. Its just he's voice is so soothing especially whenever he laughs??!!!!! OMG!!
Ooooooooo my new cute son 😭🤧
Great to see your debut rizotto , keep it up and have fun
the SONG IS SO FREAKING CATCHY I LOVE IT
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I already love him the moment his music started 😩🤚🏻 omg didn't expect that one
as a fellow australian, i'm a bit lost in terms of the schedule. Since he says he lives in australia, in every state it's always the same day just different times all around the country but he says that his debut stream 2.0 is on a monday but that would be on a tuesday in australia. this debut was on a monday. I'm kind of confused sorry. please correct me if i'm wrong about anything. :))
Jeez, I should've watched this stream A LOT SOONER. Understandable lore, passionate at music, straight up shows his original song, I love at least 3 animes from his list of favourites, a punny guy  I'll be looking forward on future streams :D
NO I LOVE HIM
Yo, he's somewhat like me when it comes to superheros :0 I'm not usually a fan, but Spiderman can take my heart LOL  Edit: Rewatching just to listen to Blue Sugar TwT  Edit 2: Just realized, he's playing Genshin Sunday?? I'm excited for that! :0
Yay!! Another genshin player!! Les gooo!!!
Why do you look like you're trying to tongue punch a glass hole in the screen the whole time?
https://youtube.com/channel/UChtGZqsMxPPR7zrzVQW0D8w
Animal crossing LMAO
Great debut and even better song
Wow I love risotto
He seems too cool. Get rid of him
Welcome to nijisanji ren!! Luv the song!!! I saw a comment saying you’re like a big brother, and i agree!!! That song killed me i swear my heart rate stopped from the excitement and adrenaline.
いやぁ...本当にオリジナル曲が良すぎてハート鷲掴みにされてしまった 衝撃的すぎて一生忘れられないや  I’ll never forget the first time I heard your original song.
It was stunning, it was gorgeous, we Stan we love, YES ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
He's so cool But I love his lore is "I used to murder people but I got bored" Also the song so good thank ren💜 Please put the song on Spotify
9:13 his third language 😭
Do you have your Spotify
Your song is sooo lit!! Whatta banger. Congrats to your debut also, im looking forward to your streams
what is this dog shi lol
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                    /.,/. ,. ./,/.,/.

Wow this debut was of another level. His story telling is great, the music video was of really high quality. His singing is so good! And his speaking voice and laugh is to die for.  He seems really easy going too. I think he will go really far🌸  I also really enjoy meditating and breath work too ^^ Hope you can do streams about that in the future~ looking forward to hearing more of you and your music Ren🛸🖤

as a competitive swimmer...      i totally agree cometitive sports suck.
holy shit he has the same birthday as me
This is my oshi, bye
Oh my my my, you love Owl City and Waterparks too 🥹💖 that's why I can hear bits and pieces of the influence on your debut song (which is absolutely wicked wonderful all on its own btw) looking forward to hearing more songs from you, you've got such stellar vocals- lit what sucked me into Iluna apart from the brilliant character designs was how you delivered your intro line, it was astronomical!
CONGRATS ON YOUR DEBUT REN ! Blue sugar was amaizing 😈🛸🖤🖤
Welcome Ren Zotto! Anyway, your debut is just sooo— Yet your song, ABSOLUTELY FALL IN LOVE WITH IT!!!
Reliens would a sick fan name for us extraterrestrials haha
YES SO CUTE
HOLY FUCK
he's so cute omg
I think he sings beautifully! ！ ！
Finally someone lisens music 24.7 ;^;
no hamsters sadge
"If any ghosts out there wanna haunt me" has the exact same energy as "hey there demons it's me, ya boi" and it was in this moment I knew, even more of my life is going to get spent watching nijisanji vtuber streams.
Ok but why does he kinda sound like Jordan Sweeto tho 👀 nah but seriously, awesome debut! Can’t wait to see more!
He looks like rin from blue exorcist
How are you so talented, you’re amazing, the lore video and the music were both so good 😭💚💚
Dino bros 😌
HYPE! YOU'RE SO GOOD UGH 🎉💕
im stuck at 24:19 on repeat.
OWL CITY AND WATERPARKS OMG YOU'RE MY KIND, ALSO CONGRATS ON YOUR DEBUT REN!
Idk what he should call his fans but he sure could finish his streams with a "See you later invaders!"
日本語可愛い....( *ˊᵕˋ* )💗 I like your voice!!!!
That Animal Crossing language was so on point wth 😂😂 Also congrats on your debut Ren. Blue Sugar was cracked and you're such a sweetheart. Can't wait to watch your upcoming streams 😈🛸
His backstory is “fuck it we ball”
EYYY CONGRATS ON YOUR DEBUT
LOOKING FORWARD FOR MORE CONTENT :D
his “i like trains ☺️” was so fckin cute my goodness
Blue Sugar High is a goddamn banger, how amazing of a debut, seriously well done!!!!
I love how his horns look like a harp
HE LIKE WATERPARKS AHHHH
Made me spat out water with that animal crossing impression. Thank you for the fun stream Ren!
Omg protect ur alban sunny😭
omg original song is a banger
i was literally laughing when ren shows his model amd the chat goes broom wooshing sha, down bad chat😭
sad i couldnt make it cuz of school :( i really like his singing tho so blue sugar made up for it :)
THAT SONG IS A BANGER!!!!
oniichan frfr 😍😍
This guy gives me big brother type vibes which I like. I can't wait to watch more things from you Ren!
yeah okay i am in love with you
I thought he would have deep voice kyo's but his is cute and he can speak in animal crossing 😌
i know i'm not the only one who thinks he's the english ver of sonny c:
yo who doesnt hate bannana strings?
Love cats? You dont need to say more!!! Is there a chance for him to play STRAY? just curious
his horns ripping the hood of that sweater was such a nice touch I was dying hehehe
Hope to have a chance to hear Ren play the piano🥺😭
Call us Risottos, my liege 🙇‍♀️
<3
Omg your music is so dope!
he's so cutee
Welcome Ren!! You're so adorable, you like music and play nintendo games 😭🖤 immediate oshi material (also blue sugar is such a bop omg)
Not going to lie, when I saw he dropped a song as his debut I was expecting something that leaned towards rock or hip hop and that made use mostly of his lower range, but I was pleasantly surprised! His higher range is amazing and I loved the song a lot too. It’s so catchy and the synth in the bg gives me life, and I think it compliments his voice well. Congrats on your debut and for surpassing 160k subs, ren!!! Looking forward to more music from you 😈  — a fellow game ost enjoyer and punk rock enthusiast
hates summer,, same...prefers cold, same....paranormal shit ayyy yeah same. nocturnal my mannn haha
The original debut songs😭😭❤
Fan name: earthlings? 😂😂

Omg that's such a banger
Seeing your fave bands really shows the inspiration you got for Blue Sugar. I wouldn’t call it punk rock or emo but def pop punk or alt pop. When I first heard it I thought of hellogoodbye and the ready set
I really love your voice your song was amazing congrats on your debut man 💜
Congrats on debuting! OMGGG I love your song, sooo cool! I love the edm and autotune vibes, and your voice is amazing. I can't wait to see what more you've got to show us and maybe even a sneak peek into how you created your songs?

Congrats on your debut Ren! First and foremost, that song was a complete and unexpected banger and I will gladly keep listening to it.

Omg I loved this debut stream so much🖤🖤
We all thought he was a daddy, but he's more like a cool big brother. And he thinks Spider-Man is okay when he doesn't like superheroes. That's all I can ask for. With great power, comes something or other. All I know is that I want pictures of Spider-Man! Have you gotten those photos printed, yet?
Welcome to Nijisanji!!!! I love, love your lore animation and the original song!!!! I can't wait for the streams and I can't wait for what's to come!! I'm already loving you (I'm sure I'm not alone on this)!!!! <333
