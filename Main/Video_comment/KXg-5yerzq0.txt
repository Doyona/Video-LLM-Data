What’s the coordinates to the entrance of the deep dark area
Please. Someone help me find the silent trim!!! Is it in the world?
I got your map recently, and I went down into the deep dark  The wardens you placed in cages were a terrible idea in practice, I completely see what your plan was, it was a treasure vault, but you have to sneak past a warden to get it  However, what those wardens do is they kill every single thing that moves above it making the majority of the deep dark in near permanent darkness, I had to place a bed next to each and every spawner, and just die over and over again while hitting the warden with my sword  Other than that however, I love your map
Is there a silence armor trim here?
Does anyone know if the dwarves mine/the founders smelting area is in the bedrock version of the map I can’t seem to find it and neither can my friend can’t find it
Please update your map version Marketplace add-on is not working
Where are the entrances?
Where is it
I think it looks like Undertale's new home, your construction is great, it never ceases to amaze me.
Would be better if jungle had main door to fit story saying jungle was first.
This has been my favorite video so far 😮
Where is this cave on the map @TrixyBlox i can't find it  Thanks !
Mhh... Like Goal not reached :D
I've made a character strictly based on your USW and I'm working on a book too based on your incredible building and terraforming skill
Giant Dwarf me thinking of Mirror Mirror
I Love the world ❤❤❤❤😊 But I can’t get it😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
i gotta do it....   I AM A DWARF AND IM DIGGING A HOLE!
you are incredible ❤
You are Amazing
where is this? edit: it is under the ruined portal
But what about the bone tribe are they not a part of all this. Do they only have a relationship with the wolf tribe
♨
One of my most recent SMP's use this map. I claimed this city as my own. Very useful knowing the way it was made.
I forgor this existed ☠️
Rock and stone everyone!
It looks like asgadian god's forge
Mojang should hire you.
You don’t know how happy I am to see how fucking Epic the jungle and dwarf statues are.
I cant really find what command to use to mask the roof + add glowberries any1? Like how do you randomly place multiple blocks to make it look more realistic
insane, do you think my lets play does it justice?
How do that Did you use World edit 🤯🤯🤯
IF your looking for more USW content ive just started a survival series on my channel! it would mean the world if you could check it out! enjoy ^ _^!!
where is this cave located in the USW? is there an entrance?
This episode is litteraly that one city in The Lonley Mountain in The Lord of the Rings series
Where is this on the map?
Cool
I can't put into words how amazing I think this is
If this thing ain’t a game  by 2026 then I lived for nothing and my whole life was a mistake
I literally just spent a half hour struggling with a 8x8 roof before seeing this.
A
How about mineshafts
Bro just make the mangrove swamps
I swear, someone is gunna download this world when it’s done and make EVERYTHING functional
i understand the idea but the headdress feels a bit out of place and inappropriate in this one 😅
WOW!!! It is very awesome

Imagine all the sleepy market dwarves occasionally waking up because of a bat activating the skulk sensors lol
Idk if anyones noticed but every biome in the inter biome mining network has had something bad happen to them:  Desert: pharaoh summoned wither Jungle: the jungle temple being cursed  Mesa: wolf tribe was chased to the savannah  This means that the inter biome mining network might not be happening at the time when we are playing it
What about connecting to the mesa, jungle and desert
Trust me, this world worth for 1B dollars Mr. Beast will buy this minecraft world
how can one face be so punchable
I would 100% watch a tv show of this
the devotion is real
So the dwarves are the equivalent to undertales monsters.
And I’m proud of my dirt hut….
To bad the wardens have the sonic boom ability now. Even in its cage, the wardens still dangerous
Overview 19:37
Where is the caves exactly in the biomes
Dude leave some hoes for the rest of us
Bro, my PC gonna catch on fire if I play this
Quick question what r u doing abt sonic boom?
Can you make a gate leading a Dwarvan castle
where can i download the map? / donde puedo descargar el mapa?
There are 2 types of minecraft players... Type A: cant build a simple house more complex than a wooden box.   Type B: the guy who builds a continent, several ancient civilizations with rich lore and culture & cities.
I wished so hard that you build a Lord of the rings style cave and you did, love it!!!
The shape of the world reminds me of the world from CrossCode aka the “Croissant”
I think you shouldve made the jungle entrance at the bottom since the jungle king was the most important of the three
I would love to swim there 😂
could you hire somebody to make custom mobs? maybe like an dwarf villager and custom sculk mobs, like an sculk zombie, an zombie covered in sculk. and maybe an amethyst monster and an alive lush cave flower
What's the difference of Dragon City from Monster Legends?
You should make the village cost in taiga biyum
Absolutely obsessed with those videos!! They inspire me a lot and I always find myself doodling while watching them
This is my favourite upgrade so far
Please become a real life architect...Within a few span of time, U will be known as the best architect living...  :)
can you play as a server with friends?
The amethyst roof actually looks cool with the white wall
this countruccions are amazing, good job
I stopped watching USW for a bit and i'm glad I did.................................................................... Because now I can watch a bunch in one go and not have to wait months for the next vid.
Its like a fantasy
YOU ARE INCREDIBLE, I don't think 250,000 likes are enough for your builds, it should get over millions of likes cuz your builds are masterpieces! I don't get why some people in the comments are demanding, what you're building is more than enough already yet some people aren't that satisfied..
It's interesting that the faction known for their toughness is called the Copper faction, Copper is notably weaker for Tools, Weapons and Armour than Bronze and especially Steel, Copper is a softer Metal than Iron, it's easier to deform and harder to shatter, but when it does deform it stays that way until you bend it back to it's original shape, Iron in contrast is harder and thus more brittle, but turning it into Steel makes it less Brittle  High Carbon Spring Steel is arguably the best material to forge a Sword from, it has excellent edge retention and it can deform like a Copper Blade without the deformation being permanent, or rather it literally has Spring-like Properties, as the name of the material suggests Springs are in fact made of Spring Steel, so a Sword made from it has similar properties, however the name Spring Steel covers a wide Range of different Steels as seen here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_steel
Anyone else notice that the dwarf statue is basically just Thor from marvel
Insane
Please make an upgrade on the strongholds please.
where Swamp?
When is Mojang gonna hire this guy 🤣 Goddamn.
Mojang should add these to Minecraft these builds are so cool
This series is the SINGLE GREATEST use of Minecraft.
Imagine if at the end of all this it’s just an over 1,000 episode playlist called “how to build the ultimate survival world”
I'm from Philippines i really love your videos
bro made blackreach
best THING I EVER SEEN IN MINECRAFT HISTORY (in my opinon)
You should do the  BIRCH BIONE
it is stupid for the jungle king statue to be kneeling before the dwarf statue
I like that the title of this one have clue of which biome is being remade... I want to replay certain video but I have difficulty to find which video is which biome...
You should rly make this into a server with actual npc and players ,that would just be awesome you know
😎
USW usw...
U r such sn inspiration to me
well, the warden doesnt work well for this because of its ranged attacks.
Rock and stone!
I love these so much thank you for doing this
But the amathest roofs looked so good
"And to make way for"PRJNCE ALI MAKE WAY FOR PRINCE ALLIIII
The warden is a "mini" boss? xD Yike
sir please your empty world download link
You should make a frost faction
Trixy try makeing custom mobs for usw it would bit cool for a little bit more lore
hey trixyblox! I have an idea, for every new update can you add like a mini-biome island? so like an island that is like one biome, not HUGE but well, like one entire biome made into an island
Kinda reminds me of Elena kingdom.
That lava channel and its statues is so kriffing cool!!
Where  is the strong hold?
I think that this map would benefit from things like the Create mod a lot due to how many implied contraptions you've been making
this is beyond amazing! i am so excited to download this world when it comes out!!!
epic keep up the good work :D  👍
If you are the first person to read this, you have equipped fugnikin bird and is the god of fugnikin bird. Congrats
This guys says epic so much lol
In the end you sould transformer THE END
what shader are you using?
minecraft
Trixy could you please make this a marketplace content for bedrock edition and a cool thing you could also do a skin pack of all the dwarfs and pharaoh
I will show this channel to my mother and tell why i want to be a gamer
👏 wonderful
3:35 for anyone who wants to skip the dragon city ad
Will you update the nether and the end as well?
Hey trixy blocks....I have watched many of your building.....I actually quit mine craft for a long time...but im back in it....building a dark souls rpg map....its very large....and I'd like to work with you....my gamer tag 'armored sparrow'....   I'm not famous for my builds....but I believe you might be impressed honestly...  I'm not here trying waist your time.  I get it....why would you waste your time with a nobody like me....but I say it again...im not famous...and I don't want the fame...I just wanna build a cool world...I grind hrs upon hrs every day....while juggling my true profession...being an author.   I really think you should see this build.💯
11:23 what happens with his voice when he sais planning?
Would this places have villagers ??
I just thought I’d ask sense your one of the best builders I know if you could build something for technoblade
he called the warden a mini boss...haha
This was CRAZY impressive wow!
Is this going to spawn villagers?
Are you going to be making a stronghold?
hobbit homes??!?!!DWARF CAVES!!?!?!?!?! is this a spin off from the hobbit😂😂❤❤❤
I dont                                                                                                                                           yea
i wonder if he will put mods in the USW
I feel inadequate at minecraft watching this, holy shit this guy knows how to build
a lot of the expectations of 1.19 sure aged like milk
by far the best episode yet! keep up the amazing work :)
I didn't like how you made the wardens as guards. I'd like it more if you made a giant warden statue in the middle of the build to show that they made friends with wardens and if you go near it it should summon a warden
I so love this project, it should never end.
The real name of the warden is william
Trixy blox
I love every video you have
I've seen dragon city from Mrbeast
What version is the map gonna be in?
Will you be adding the Mangrove Forest when it comes out?
Is there actual npcs in usw
So I just read that this map will be finally releasing in August. So I was just wondering if I can get it on my Xbox. I know how to download mods and maps from Mcpedl so if the process is similar I can pull it off. I'm aware I'd have to subscribe for the download and that's something I'm willing to do to get this legendary map on my Xbox. Lol
Amazing buildings
After the Wild update I gotta say them dwarfs must have been very very VERY powerful to trap the Wardens. Honestly I would have taken up a more, forbidden area where the Wardens dwell that was sealed off after they were awakened from Dwarfs mining too deep. The dwarfs were attacked and were overpowered with even there iron golems being no match for the beasts. In a last desperate attempt to prevent them from reaching their city they sealed them in blowing up their previous caverns leaving a whole network of abandoned outpusts right under the city infested with sculk and Wardens. If would be sooooo cool to accidentally stumble upon an ancient opening to one of these caverns and carving through the ruble only to find the ancient horrors that hunted the dwarfs generations ago
You should have changed the copper factions library into a armory
I like how he described the wardens as minibosses even though they're stronger than the ender dragon and wither combined. How much of a gigachad are you?
10:37
Lplp
"Giving as minibosses" that aged poorly
This is so cool
You should keep the water channels dark and light blue wool
Nice build, but you seem to have forgotten one teensy aspect of the wardens…            Those things have more health than the Ender Dragon
Amethyst is my favourite gemstone. It was _supposed_ to be my birthstone, but my lazy ass slept in... for two weeks... already tired of the world and I hadn't been born yet. Anyway now it's aquamarine lol 😎
Is the island made out of 16 mill blocks or is it that large
This is so cool! Even if you wouldn't have mentioned the Hobbit in the video this build would still remind me of the movie and i think that this just looks amazing.
The story and lore for this is getting better and better every video and all for it. : )
Wait why there is only 208, 000 likes I don't understand
30% subscribed is insane! It's usually 7% or something!
If I ever become a tv show director, I think I would love to make a tv dedicated to exploring this world, kinda like a lord of the rings tv series, you do good work man👍
THIS IS RUBBISH HE USES WORLD EDIT! I MADE A HUGE BUILD WITHOUT WORLD EDIT. WHY CANT HE!
I know I should not criticize this project that has taken months but I feel like the surface biomes aren’t populated enough
nice job thanks
Can you make Asian city
The skulk is gonna spread
I hope you don't mind if i use a similar design for my base. Even it is not goimg to be as big as yours because i build it in survival. Thanks

11:16 “Finally I made some finer tweaks to the final details”
Trixyblox make the USW free please this is absolutely amazing 👏
question are those dwarves actual players or is that cgi
DUUDE that’s truly awesome
For the religious building could u do one similar to hindu or budism? I’m dyslexic so please comment if I spelt things wrong cuz I know I definitely did lol.
I feel if the roofs was made of crystal it well be better and give it a cool purple light effect cause the cave is already dark and its hard to see as a player and it well give it some of the 1.18 feels
This guy is making elden ring 2
I think you should try adding a female leader for the snow mountains. It would be a nice shake up.
wish you added a deep dark biome with warden with trees and stuff to customize the end portal
Video starts at 3:35
do you know when it's going to be released
Mojang should do some special coding and make special villagers for each village
Can’t the warden crawl through the ground now to escape?
Woop wööö00p
Wow. I kinda fell away from watching your videos because I lost my old account and for the life of me couldn’t remember your channel name. But I’m glad I’m back. Love you’re videos!
is the world 16 million blocks or 16 thousand blocks because in the first video it says 16,000 blocks or 16,000,000 blocks?
Grian is shook
Will you be upgrading the nether and the end as well?
Trixy: 250k likes for next part  Video: “at 207k” Trixy: Eh good enough
hi can you please incorporate some of Russia’s famous locations and architecture in the snowy biomes? love your vids 💛
You are the biggest builder I've ever seen.
Mangrove swamp: “I’m about to ruin this man’s whole career”
Me: damn that's awesome, i might give it a try.... My Pc: don't you fucking dare
"I see that 39.9% of you are subscribed" Stop copying Dream it hurts my brain.
please tell me you will make a samurai village!
I love it!
This makes we want to go watch the hobbits lol
oof the wardens will be tough to beat, walls dont do much bc theyve got these screams? that can do damage regardless of walls in a 15 block horizontal radius and a 20 block vertical radius meaning they can still hurt you even if youre 15 blocks away and 20 blocks up
This world is amzing i would totally explore it but sadly it's on his patreon and am not willing to drop my money
Mangrove biome
This is so cool! I really enjoy these episodes because you are so good in adding beautiful details it looks so cool!!! FANTASTIC VIDEOS! ^^
it would be so much nicer if trixy made costum mods so that it will be more immersive would be pretty cool                                                  Edit:i just tought about it and he could just add plugins
Can I get this on bedrock edition?
It’s not gonna be easy to take the stealthy approach with the warden since now it can sniff you out
Someone/you should take this and put a (limited) modded spin on it, like using tinker's construct so the forge is legitimately operational, and some unique weapons/enchantments for the dwarves. I believe you're able to limit crafting for certain items with data packs, so you could theoretically have tinker forge molds in the mine, and make it so players could only create unique weapons in the mines. That way, OP weapons can't be made off the bat and take away from the experience. Also, custom NPCs could be a huge addition. Just a thought.
Hermitcraft starter bases be like:
i would like to sugest that you change the amethyst faction roofs back to amethyst.
he somehow made an ancient city EVEN BETTER!!!
I honestly liked the amethyst roofs better
Dude, this is great!
It's there a reason you didn't use any actual cooper blocks in the build? Just wondering because I love them and I think it would be a nice way to brighten it up a little
To me the Warden sounds like the balrogs. They were maiar corrupted by Morgoth before the dawn of time and took the form of monsters of Shadow and Flame. They were killed off in the war of wrath at the end of the first age save for their commander, Gothmog who was killed when Ecthelion rammed his pointed helmet into Gothmog's chest and they tumbled down into the Fountain of the King and Durin's Bane who fled when Beleriand and Angband were destroyed after the War of Wrath and fell into a deep slumber until the Dwarves dug too greedily and too deep and it awoke, killing Durin VI and forced the dwarves to retreat to Erebor. Orcs set up camps in the mines of Khazad Düm renamed to Moria until the Fellowship of The Ring passed through an fought many of the orcs and a cave troll until they awoke Durin's Bane and Gandalf confronted the creature and fell down into the great chasm of Moria, using Glamdring, the same sword wielded the king of Gondolin, he struck the balrog man times and chased it from the deep pool up the endless stairs and channeled the lightning to kill Durin's Bane.
you need to put in mangrove wood as well in the shores of the mushroom island.
Kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaak
Warden finna mess us up with the Sonic Boom
amazing!!!
Can i play it on bedrock?
thats some god of war type shit
Imagine if the world had corrupted :0
PLEASE make a fake sun for the dwarves
What hapend to the bundle?
Best video ever
Me gusta esta serie quiero ver lo que sigue
Man, now just imagine if this was modded and you had some of the mods that let you make custom npcs and all that! Obviously amazing as-is in vanilla, but its fun to imagine the possibilities with modding!
This is absolutely amazing art, but I have to say it doesn't make much sense for the gold being poured into the smelters to already be molten.
this is just too epic.
the fact he keeps on blowing my mind with every new build he’s done is unreal <3
Damn that actually looks gooooooooooooooooood!!!😃😀
If wardens are miny bosses, I am scared
I wonder can you do the sky next?
I have a question. Can you “beat” the usw? If so I think you should be able to work with the factions to get different endings.
Still waiting for someone to make a whole modpack and story line for TrixyBlox's map
Imagine if someone made an animated series about this , that would be cool
*Shamelessly writes down story to use for D&D campaign*
1. MrBeast style of editing is distracting, dizzling and unnecessary. 2. Your face is too close to the camera. 3. I don't even want or need to see your face in the first place.  4. You're too "big" of a youtuber to even read that comment or care. I'm preaching to the choir.
This dude should be a engineer.
Make it free
Will there be a way to play this on bedrock
0:44 that aged poorly
Usw will only be played in minecraft?
PLZZZZ MAKE A MOD PACK FOR THIS!!!!!
second video of this sieries that was sponsered by monster legends, i think?
notice how shiny his teeth have gotten over the past few months
God damn that's FUCKING GORGEOUS
No so I just noticed the island looks like a guy, and his eyes are the river to his mind, you need to do some cult surrounding that, and some huge story with Easter eggs just scattered everywhere
Reminds me of that Diggy Diggy Hole song.
oh my gosh! It’s sooooo cool! Caves are my favorite thing in Minecraft and this one’s way better then normal ones! Also when it’s done and we can play it do you have to be on Java adition
Remember when Minecraft was just a game of crafting and mining?
I remember watching your video about the underground kingdom!! However I didn’t have an account so I could’nt subcribe to you, but now that I do I can get notifications each time you make a video! Also I absoluty love your builds!
💯💯
my god. im in awe.
Imagine if someone or some game organisation made a whole game based on everything trixy is making and we could get an amazing open world game all cause of the genius minds working on the USW
instead of mirroring the two factions, you should switch the copper factions library out for like a place for training.
Don't forget about the mangrove swamps
I want nothing more than to ride the minecarts around that city
Just admit it, you copy and pasted the dwarves Lord Of The Rings kingdom into minecraft
On the Outer Islands that formed, megacities there would look  awesome, there could also be an ancient pirate city where the pirates could come from
This is actually incredible! Like I don’t think many of us have fully wrapped our head around how detailed and laborious this creation is. It’s insane I love all the ideas and still can’t get over how u actually implement them so well into the game, wish I could do this with my friends you have actually inspired us to create something like this (on a much smaller scale of course). We all can’t wait to play this, mad respect 🐐
Cannonicly those dwarves are fucking dead because the warden
the hanging conveyor reminded me of the one in star wars ep2 (attack of the clones) in the droid factory
Pov me just join
this is incredible
My god, this is going to be a BIG thing when it releases... I know I said it before but people are going to do lets plays of this in their own YT channels, there's even a chance Minecraft itself will buy permission to put this in the actual game itself. This is absolutely massive...
While theres not enough positives I can say, I have one slight worry, and that is with the skulk you used. This might be such an unintended death trap since now the Warden can be summoned in different places
The themes in this world are awesome!
please tell me youll add mods to expand the loot you can get and make some areas like this forced to be late game
I honestly believe someone is gonna start an rp world out of this
"Guild" would probably be a better description than "Faction" when referring to the two types of dwarves.
Mojang should hire you
Poor guy didn't knew at the moment they gonna make warden op
I would join the amethyst faction because building and crafting is more my thing.
I already know very many Minecraft players will let's play this
why doesnt this have more likes and views :l
Mods!
I wanna see trixy blox play build battle, i would pay 1M dollars to watch him play build battle
Dwarves? Oh well   I AM A DWARF AND I'M DIGGING A HOLE.
I'm not a good builder and I always just make a structure my base and I might make this my base, anyways well done as always trixy!

When will this be done and is it going to be on bedrock? I wanna explore the far places in that world
i'm really excited to play this, saying you did an amazing job would be an understatement
Sad problem is anyone with an average computer won’t be able to enjoy it cus if render distance
I would love to see a hobbit/lord of the rings build. Like Gollum’s cave, or the trolls village. Maybe one of the dwarvin mines/fortress/cities
add an eco system of new mobs and this world will be truly magical
What shaders do you use?
I love how inclusive you are! You try your best to accurately represent all cultures you gain inspiration from and/or base a building off of. I also like how you made the IBMN/IMN with the statues and entrance. I wonder why the bone tribe wasn't included? Also, the dwarves culture and beliefs are nice. The way neither of the factions are inferior is great.
I think there will be a huge multiplayer server, hint the USW being popular, then a link to download the world for themself I dont know if im totally right and its already stated, or im totally wrong haha.
How much will the usw cost?
Yo where is the panda bioam in this world
I don’t understand how people can be so talented. It looks amazing!
you should add mods and make a modpack
this is sooooo nicccce you have such talent
superbe construction, du bon boulot l'équipe 👍👍
Imagine a mutant warden spawns there  Mutant warden is 4 times bigger than the original size (only imagination)
You should’ve kept the amethyst roofs for the Amethyst Faction and given the Copper Faction some copper block roofs imo
I remember playing Dragon City when it was on Facebook lol
this dude and sci craft should meet up and build something that can only be rendered in on a nasa super computer
I don't know if you have any Nether lore, but Minecraft put ruined portals into most biomes, even the ocean. Would you put ruined Nether portals throughout the world? Or do people build there own?
Just a sprinkle of mods and an ultrapowered pc and monitor, = the PERFECC world
Him: so with that let us take a look at the usw's new upgraded caves Random cat food ad: allow me to introduce myself
I do really love seeing huge builds like this. This is spectacular!
It's kinda like deep rock beacause it's dwarfs and underground
Wow this is AMAZING I'm so excited for the other biomes!!!
i think this would also look super amazing with a great mod with new mobs etc. definitely going to play this when it releases
your work is incredible! every video is a delight. just be sure to avoid burnout and ask for help from your community if you need it!
Wow he so good that he didn't even have to play
You should make this a server or realm or whatever it's called
Literal god tier building.
I'd love to see a version of moria done by TrixyBlox
that's not legal how do you build that good
Imagine Pixelmon or Dragonfire on this bro, that would be sick
Gives me chasm vibes
Me when I realise that there ar e creepers walking around here
Whenit comes out you should add a screen you where you can upgrade character
By far one of the most beautiful build I ever seen !
Mojan after making the warden invincible Trixyblock:maybe making the warden as a boss is a mistake
In my minecraft world/headcanon, the dwarves don't have a religion, relying on technology and strength instead of a god to help them survive. Also, the Dwarf Empires are either  technocracies or a dictatorships.
I don't know which faction I would join, I'm good at both PvP and Creativity.
The jungle city path should be caved in because of the curse
after completing this project can u do a hardcore series
Hey Trixyblox, how did you get the 1.18 stuff in caves to spawn naturally in worldpainter while not screwing up the above ground area? Populate will mess everything up on the surface...
Will this world be on bedrock
Makes me think it would have been cool to have a statue "holding" up the ceiling.
These caves and tunnels remind me of the Deep Roads from Dragon Age. Very cool! :)
what about the ancient portal? on the 1.19 update there’s a new music disc called disc 5 sound of this disc is someone finding an ancient city and the warden and he escape from the warden finding an ancient deep dark portal and you hear a portal sound but sound of souls screaming and he seems to walk through the portal finding a monster that seem to be stronger than the warden and you hear the ancient portal losing up a power and the portal close that means a person is trap on the portal………………          or it might be a person summoning the monster
I really want to make a map like this on my world for the fantasy comic I'm making. This also give me so many ideas. I love it
this has got to be the coolest thing you've done in the USW thus far, omggg. amazing work as always!!!!
I absoulutely canot wait for the complete world!! so proud of you and your journey on this project!!!! it would be some extra work and if you haven't done it already it would be top notch if you could mod the villagers to the dwarf skin and have them working there in game. Each and every one of these builds are Crazy Awesome and each time I am astounded by the creativity and the architecture! KEEP IT UP!!! you're freaking awesome!!!
The "Founders' Smelting Area" should just be called "The Foundry" Little play on words for ya.
Nope 1.19 is the wild update
If you didn’t know even pros can’t take on the warden without Dying cause it has more than one hundred hearts
Can you add dogs
You’re literally making a whole new game and I’m here for it. Mojang should compensate you in some way for all of this incredible work. Feel like I’m about to play a WOW style rpg within Minecraft.
You make mods look useless
I love your content 😊
Once you have completed the world, please could you do an overview video of everything that you have created? The best series ever!!
Rock:I am a stronk guy.  Trixy Blox:Hold my mouse Rock:I take it back!
You are amazing!
I don't know why you stupid mods keep banning me
well if the warden escape all the dwarf are gone because theye have anothere attack when he open his rip cage and release a sonic attack the one shot even in netherite armor and could go in walls and theye can swim and canot die in lava making the warden op
When is the next Episode coming out
Make the upright structure Minecraft world on your merge store
this is incredible. i have no more words.
Nice
R/ sent me
POV: You are bored and don't know what to do.
😮jd
You could make an abandoned underwater city once inhabited by merfolk, but the something tragic happened with then that was caused by an elder guardian attack.
What’s the ip?
The like goal was a littel big 56k to go after 2 months
Rslash sent me
how about the nether??? is ist possible to restrict the nether to an similar area ??? it would be Awesome if u could terraform parts of the nether :)
You could make sort of an underwater city, with ocean monuments in the middle...
What he builds in 1 days can't do in 10 years
I feel like the snowy mountains should be like japanese style housing if that makes sense
I’m getting some powerful erebor vibes here and I love it
Why the heel do I wanna live here?!?!?!?!
You can use spruce or dark oak slabs/stairs to make parts of trees. They look like a lot of the wood
I swear the cave totally gives me the Erebor vibes 😭💯 I wonder if you will also add some Elven builds as well?
Hey what if you added mods like for actual dwarves?
sick super good but brooo what about the portal duuude thats like the best part of the deep dark
anyone else notice trixy getting paler has the series goes on?
My jaw dropped with each and every structure u built, the level of imagination and execution Mind. Fucking. Blowing.
I’m getting some Nidavellir vibes from Avengers Infinity War. Dwarfs smelting different metals to make some of the most powerful weapons.
Omg when can I play
I NEED THE NEXT ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
adding mods like create and tinkers construct would make this already incredible build that much better
please keep doing this series, ik you dont have enough likes, but i liked it and i want you to make more
Is this world out yet? i’ve been waiting for so long to play it 😭
how many players did u use for the end of the video?
allright so 1,17 came out in june and 1,18 in december.if the pattern continues 1.19 will be released in june 2022
My question is will there be npc mods for the empires? Or will they be a empty world for the player to explore and do what they wish with? As i am curious to see.
You are so f ing good bro. I learned so many things out of your building skills!
I was like “no way he’s still working on it”. Cuz I saw the video was like a year ago and holy shit mans still goin!!
It's great but I think if you spend 3 month on the next project it's must the something interesting 🤔
Can you add The Shire from hobbit in this world?
Can you recreate Erebor in minecraft, or can you make The Shire or Minas Tirith
Ur teeth are whiter than they were a year ago keep up the brushing 🤙
this map gets too lonely idk y there are no villagers in certain areas
U can add a train track to go from the Mesa biome to the forge
I hope it will be playable on bedrock...
Hi, sorry for asking this question here, but on your first video, how did you load all the chunks to be visible in worldpainter?
This is the most insane build cities I have ever seen.
when will it be available on patreon since it doesn't appear to me or every time they update patreon, by the way they do an excellent job
You must do the nether and the en right?
I love your content and I would find it really useful if you did a video on how to use world edit and other programs that you use
Buddhist monastery on snowy mountain would look so epic @TrixyBlox
Me again, with a kind reminder to REACH THE LIKE GOAL FOR THE REST OF THE UPGRADES TO THE ULTIMATE SURVIVAL WORLD!!!
Cant wait for this to release!
Bruh, you haven't posted in 2 months
I've been playing mincraft about 7 or 6 years and.. IM STILL BAD AT BUILDING!! i should be more talented like him!. (to be honest)
I feel like he is making the fortnite map
Are you going to remake the nether?
The conveyors in the mines reminds me of the one in mustafar in star wars
Pls upgrade nether and end too it would be so coooollll
Well now that wardens can shoot through walls it’s gonna be hard to explore
Oh boy, I can bearly wait for more! Good luck!!!!!
Warden has a range attack so it will destroy the people in the city
Hey man don't you think a lost civilization underwater would be a good to add
Bro the seed
And you re buildings are cool but I'm from different country. That means I can't download Ur buildings. That's awful. I don't need to give my all money to buch of buildings! 😡😡😡
That survival Island is awesome! But  one thing, I'm waiting the world download, and I hope it will be fee download. Last Island was a lot of costs. So I don't like it.
Is it gonna be for mcbe and mcpe?
Why Are you not doing more vibeo
So amazing
Hey trixy you forget the ocean monument and ancient underwater ruins
I’m getting a kind of malacor meet udupoa vibe and I love it
Dude this is insane. It must be hard to put in such a huge amount of work only to end up with a 20 min video but trust me it was definitely worth it. I honor your effort a lot. This detail in both constructioan and design and even background story is nothing but overwhelming
Sad for Bedrock editions
I am literally so stoked for this project
We want part 8
построй например бункер военных
The island looks like pac man
The Island looks like pac man
I hope mat pat makes a video on this worlds story
Is this map going to be available for console?  I’d kill to play this on PS4!
when you do snow montains/taiga and viking ships and towns and sauna!!! ok ????
Suggestion: you could add a barbarian camp or Viking camp for the tiga or snowie mountains.
It will be verry coool to have a datapack for all of the custom trees. Like if ju plant a jungelsapling it will grow just like your custom trees. Can you do that  ? it will be really cool !
I love seeing the giant world develop but I have an idea, maybe you can make a Survival World Series to show your building skills in a non-creative world! Good luck with your channel!
When’s the next one tbh
I hope the next biome is really awesome. Ive been watching these videos since the plains biome video came out and ive just been waiting for the world to come out. Though if it doesnt come out before the end of summer im afraid it wont be as downloaded as it should be. IT would be spectacular to play this world with friends during summer break. I know 100s of hours of work has gone into this world but don't give up yet. Steam through the last two biomes and finish strong. I guess
When will the next episode come out trixy?
You should have made the gold trenches deeper and added 'heating elements' under them to keep it flowing. Otherwise, h o l y  c r a p
Can you play in creative
Please just hire him already Mojang 😫
Actually. I have a request that can i upload your vedios at my channel pleaaaasse
Next video on snowy mountains
When are you going to upload another video? It's been almost two months :/
Hey TrixyBlox, under one of the biomes that isn’t connected to the mines, redo the abandoned mineshafts as a way to show how others failed with their mines when the dwarves succeeded.
We need an viking village in the snowy biome and sapmi inspired in the taigas
Its a Dark Lush Cave! huhu has a nice ring i think!
We should make a mod adding tribes pirates and bandits and making the world come to life with the create mod adding things like difficult bosses for each biome
yo rslash sent me here
I'd hate to be the dwarf who's job it is to maintain/fuel the lanterns on the ceiling of the cave
You need to add a mod that just adds some items like bone armor and weapons for the bone tribe, amethyst and copper tools for the dwarves, etc. Just a suggestion, but I thought it would be really cool and would create some more immersion.
If this is the best survival than dont you need to do the end to
if its so hard to do your project hire some builders to help you your usw series has to give you a lot of money right?
*You* *are* *very* *Genius* *How* *your* *brain* *working* *?* 🤔
the cave really gives of a hobbit battle of five armies vibe
That guy in the cave looks like thor
TrixyBlox: Not finished a minecraft world.  Dani: First time?
You should have a Japanese style village in the taiga biome with cherry blossom trees
Haters Are Just Jealous. Hater? There's no Such Thing As A TrixyBlox Hater.
Hey umm just asking umm  2 months 👋😐 yo u done yet
Oof 59k likes away from part 8
Will this be available for purchase on bedrock???

My friend can’t play 1.18 so would it be possible to get a non 1.18 version?
Is this for phone
Red fort
Can you maybe also make like a mod for this ore find someone that can make a mod for this
You also may make some cabins in ALL the map (except in caves i think). They are cute and it trow in the trash the sensation of a empty map/world  And i dont like to pass my nigth under a hole or anything like this
Bruv, just post the next video 😂
I want a movie director to make this into an actual movie or show
Common we Need 250000k Linkes!!

WE NEED MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No pressure😁😁😁

I just want to know if there will be a way to get this on console
damn after one month not even 200k likes :(
Can i copy some of your ideas?
this is just crazy
Damn youtube should gain this more views! It's BEAUTIFUL 💕❤️ Is there a  swamp biome here? Is it part in the plains? If not are they gonna be added? The new swamp biome was really cool and thought what you think.  I thought it will be cool too.
MAKE AN  hindu ritual center
Where will the warden bs held
Please make monk temples in the snowy mountains or taiga
Trixyblox makes a dope workd* me who cant even make a house
You should build a volcano on the island with a volcano tribe.
You have to get This on the marketplace, im a bedrock Player and i would kill for this map. So please do it
Hey, is this map on your Patreon??
Please add a hindu temple in some of the one biome
This is why I’m good at building now thank you so much for the inspiration
I liked how he put the dwarves in the mountains just like the hobbit can't wit to play this map
Waiting for another part...
USW nether portal and UNW- ultimate nether world please and one indian temple for indians
Where can i play that
Trixy, this would be even more amazing if you add small bits of the create mod or something else to operate doors  and other such mechanical devices, it sounds like a lot and you already done a ton, but it would be amazing to see.
Every single one of these videos get better and better. Thank you for putting the time into making this.
Where is the ocean monument
If Mojang sees this they’ll hire you in a instant
I am indian but so so so so so so so good good this world to make  sever    to playe
On Market Place soon?
It would be cool to think the giants lived there 10000 years ago but a massive storm stroked turning everything to stone then as the cave grows dwarves found out about this discovery
You should make a island biome made up of small islands.(i know its not a biome btw)
Everything you make is so amazing i'm speechless. I usually give up building a giant tower😅
You think that you could have a map of the usw island in the far islands past the usw?
Crazyyyyyy
This is absolutely stunning, but I can't stop thinking how incredibly empty and creepy it'll feel to find these gigantic cities and structures all alone and abandoned
Чем-то напоминает завод дроидов в звездных войнах и логово орков
When he releases it will it be available to bedrock?
I call the call of the warden home.
Instead of a cage with a warden make the home of the warden so the warden can't be cramped in a small area.
Nvm
I thought you were gonna make the home of the warden
If i ever played this in survival I wouldn't want to mine anything lol 😂
greetings from Indonesia
The snow biomes should have ruins if a Skyrim like Norse civilization with the remnants living in historically accurate Norse villages along the coast
bro like this
That lava not being symmetrical is pissing me off
The only thing I'd change about this video is making the dark cave clips much brighter, I couldn't see anything as you were building
Likeeeeeee!@!!
do a pireat one that will be in the ocan
It would be cool to have another door that's been  forged shut, this one leads to a smaller city was was taken over by skulk. And remember, skulk grows when things die, so a city of people would be a perfect place for it to run rampant.
I have idea for you , you can build abounded steampunk bunker or city, of once proud nation
Oppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

A hyper continent in the Jurassic era 298 to 199 million years ago
This is really giving off some Erebor vibes and I love it!
Pls
Can you make a custom spawner
This puts Mojang's Deep Dark Cities to literal shame
If you also do the nether and the end that would be extra cool.
These builds are always surprising me how cool the turn out, absolutely incredible work here. Keep it up! Im super excited for the final results but my pc is going to explode anyways bc of these massive creations D:
I seriously can't explain how amazing this is. It's totally mesmerising. The fact you sink so many hours into this, making massive original designs, while still making lore for these things is really inspiring
🇧🇷
Im inlove with this build, it looks so much like a dwarfs mine, you know what imma watch hobits, this was amazing !
The patreon dont have brasilian money, its 23 reais, that's só much for us, please made sometingh '•-•`
MY MIND = 🤯 MY EYES = 😍
Bros just building hagwarts
Mate this USW with the distant horizons mod is going to be out of this world! Seriously, excellent work can’t wait to see the finished product! Of course, take as much time as you need.
Hey I love what you do with this minecraft world but I would like you to be aware that the Allay ( the voted mob) will be locked in pillager outpost's cage like the iron golem so I wanted you to know it for future pillager outpost 😉.
im gonna laught if my pc go in fire but cant wait to see the world
So beautiful beautiful and beautiful 🤩
When you're done is it possible that you can import it into bedrock
In ten years you’ll change Minecraft with a great team! ☕️
Can you please make it free because am only 9 and I have no money and I can't get
If you want you can ad an another episode or two to transform 500x500 in nether and something in the end so those two dimensions dont be boring.
Trixy plss Upload more usw videos its been a long time since you have post😣😣
WE NEED NETHER UPGRADE TOO
i won't sleeping knowing that the lava from the dwarf statue's hammer doesn't fall right into the middle.
Does this map work on mcpe
Like to trxy blox!!!!!!!!!!!#^#^#&÷
Why are the comments like this
Minecraft should hire you to desire their ancient city
It's almost scary how good he is at making this stuff
The best build I ever saw
I loved the world more then minecraft world
This is insane!!
Nice video bro!!! Can I make the ultimate Survival world in unreal engine 5? (Making it photo realistic) (asking you permission)
What texture pack do you have?
Thank you soooo much for creating this beautiful world!  Perhaps you can build a small island beyond the sea, with a nation on it. The islanders' ancestors were criminals, being banished to the island long ago when the different factions in the main continent were still strong and prosperous. Since they are criminals, people of different origins and races are there, with a chaotic mixture of weapons, materials, and building styles. The islanders swore to take revenge and return to the continent, so they spent centuries constructing a legendary fleet with hundreds of mighty ships, plotting to conquer the continent. The fleet is currently sailing toward the continent. However, the nations in USW have declined in strength, and also have a lot of squabble between them. So the player would discover this shocking news from somewhere (perhaps the forest?) and need to search for the sailing fleet in the mid of the ocean and destroy it.
I will ALWAYS watch these videos
Cant wait to see the finished USW!!
how much is it?
this will take until 2100 or 999999999999999999999999999999999 years from now
Wow this was epic!! But one question...which part of the island this place is???
POV:you go mining for diamonds and u findthis
Anyone been waiting 10 months for this and each video makes u want to play more
Literally the coolest map ever
Cant wait for the ancient  city deep dark and mangrove
Am i dump or is that not even half a million blocks across?
Will you update this to 1.19? And will you also overhaul different dimensions?
bruh
since you have done a water and underground base. u should make an asgard type sky base
World updated on Patreon ?
Please, please, please build rivendell in the snowy mountains
WHENS THE NEXT ONE IM SO EXCITED
Can i download it using media fire when its done?
This looks so much like erebor from the hobbit bro!
Is is just me or this  cave looks kinda like the hobbit?
I want to download this map for free
Sao anh không ra video cho em xem ?
will this map be available for public download?
The USW was so great build even how its hard to work I hope we visit that USW it's exciting to me becuz I love nature
You going to do the nether and end?
I took too long to suggest basing the jungle temple on Angkor Wat in Cambodia, so I'm just going to go ahead and ask you to make a pagoda somewhere. Maybe the taiga...?
It’s the lush dark
Mcpe?
At this rate go and build a whole damn already mate .... story - ✅; art - 😍 and vision - ✅. You are sitting on a million-dollar idea, my man.   I would really appreciate you could at mods to if you could add NPCs and voice lines through a mod  .... this is really close to a AAA world design.
It's fucking AWESOME
How to download the map
He keeps mentioning “special” and “epic” loot, is he going to have mods or data packs? I can’t imagine too much vanilla Loot, diamonds I guess, heart of the sea, netherite tools maybe, enchanted books, maybe I’m just spoiled by RLCraft but Minecraft vanilla doesn’t seem like it can supply much Epic Loot.
I can not see
Add an oak forest in the corner of the plains
Plz transform the stronghold (again)
Hurry up I want to play it so bad!
honestly it's funny to me how you can make of this in one month but the real Minecraft developers make a fraction of that in a year that really just shows how slow they are...
Wait why is the mesa the wolf king shouldn't that be the savanna?
wow.
Do a upgrade for the ancient cities and make the cities have their own civilization.
Next should be stronghold and/or nether
Probably make a server with the mod that makes u do quest and stuff, also some other good mods it will be pretty good😁
Thinking about void decoration of bedrock
You inspired me to create gigantic builds in Minecraft. I also quit Minecraft. Then I saw your channel. And it inspired me to play and create. Now I create builds and mods. You are the best builder I've ever seen! I wish I could get even one of your builds. But I don't have any money. I will continue creating these gigantic structures. And I'm also transforming biomes like you! If it's okay. I hope you can finish this build and create more things that make me more inspired. Thank you for being the best builder that I've seen.
You only have 2mil? You should have more subscribers because your builds are impressive!
I think you should make one of your biome with Chinese/Japanese style, that would be cool
Wow
yall need to blow this up... we haven't hit 250k likes... yikes
Wow
ive set up a patreon account to join you when USW come out. Your the first youtuber i will be actually donating to. :)
I think you can do the other dimentions to
Stampylongnose and iBallisticsquid should do an adventure map series on this
I only have consoles so I’m really hoping it’s also bedrock since I really want to play it
I have a feeling this USW is amazing its  a masterpiece 🌌🌌
Wtf this is so cool
Where is the new video it’s been a months
Is the map already downloadable?
You are so good at building and coming up with stories behind your builds. I wish I could be as good as you.
Me checking every other day to see if theres new vids eventhough I put notifications on
WOW!
Awesome 👏
What about nether and end
*sees a beautiful breath taking build*  "Don't leave just yet there's more"  Me:there's more?!?!?!
How to download his world
How to download his world
bro I love your builds , I have taken your patreon for 5 dollar but I cannot find any of your builds from this series  plz tell how to download
If your doing the nether you should add a volcano
Did you give up on this world…? It’s been over a month and 2 days
i love how the minecraft jungle king is the exact opposite of calamity mod terraria's tyrant jungle king
WHEN IS THIS THIS COMING OUT!? I really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really wanna make a video using this (ill give you credit) on my other channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzrFQjQEKTcWBi6ebYf7_8g) because this looks SOOO GOOD!
I know of at least two people in this house who are getting excited for this release. Amazing detail.
once this releases I might make a modpqck for it
You need to continue!
genuinely cant wait for this to release, me and my friends are planning on playing it together when it finishes. Are you planning on doing anything special with loot, like having unique enchantments or anything? it would give more of a benefit to searching around rather than just going straight for netherite or something lol. either way super excited, cant wait for this to be out :)
Please tell how much it will cost us to play USW
I have an idea maybe you could add the ruins of a stronghold and inside the end would contain a kingdom owned by a Dark Overlord or something
I hope that u can cover the LUSH floor with moss and clay pools so that it’s a lush cave. Also it’s pretty funny/cool that the cave has all three biomes lol
The lush cave was just a drip stone cave with vines and a deepslate city, now it’s been corrupted :( don’t worry, I’m still a fan of ur channel, it’s just my feedback
I see the four statues as elements, earth, fire, stone, and wind.
Upgrade the sky with a jack and the beanstalk type build
this world will definitely be more than one terabyte
Could we PLEASE speed up the process to 250,000 likes? It's been like a couple months since this video was posted!📆
The geodes are actually 1.17- i played 1.17 and i found geodes
5:36
LOTR will make this more awsome
I literally cannot wait until this world drops. I will become a patron just to get this world. Love it!
im shure u  are main ornn on league. If u are not Why  did u make a  forge  uhhhh?
Hello Trixyblox I have a question for you I need to know if you can create me a custom  world with the biome's spread out and they have their own area but I need all of then form 1.18 no mods because I need it in Minecraft education, I also need bad lands really big for kingdom allover the biome's I'm doing this for student's and teacher I don't have any money but maybe you can make it in to a video series but I need it done before summer, I would be most grateful if you do Sincerely Mr.Gaming
I was thinking about this and, I think you should build a deep dark biome covered in skulk to show where the warden originated from.
so awesome and I can't wait to play it
18:56 Hahaha... "mini" bosses...
Duuude I knew you were making a mining network in the mountain of different biomes, but I didn't think you'd go full scale and built a huge cave system under an already beautiful surface, awesome job! Really liking the list format to separate each segment of the video, it helps prepare us for each new crazy addition you'll be adding to the build!
When you finish everything, will it become public without patreon?
What is the seed
Absolutely stunning builds! I had an idea that in the dwarven cave there could be a modded boss fight and if you beat it, you would unlock a powerful weapon as dwarves are the best crafters. You could also incorporate it into other biomes so each one unlocks a specific item. Just an idea, keep up the amazing work!
How does any of this have anything to do with the ultimate survival world just how
Delete this video
You made the worst video The underground island is not even a part of the survival world
When will we have the map to play on it?? Its just soooo beautiful!!!
We haven’t reached 250k likes yet
That was sooooo unbelievably cool! Everything was great but my favorite has to be the dwarf statue
Im doing the same and thx for the inspiration ;-)
These cities are bigger than the ones from skyrim. lol
Plzz can you do an temple for taiga or snowy mountains . Plzz make it a kashmir village plzzz i would be happy to see it
make the RMS titanic in Minecraft in honor of the most beloved ship and famous shipwreck this april 10th 110 years after the sinking of the ship
I love this project!- It’s hard to pick between the amethyst or copper faction, but I would probably join the amethyst. What about the stronghold? Are you planning to incorporate them? Or is this considered the stronghold?
Why not make nether or end better?🤔
How do I play on this?
This gives me some Beautopia vibes from Adventure Times !
A new boss is coming in minecraft warden
Can’t wait to try out this new map pretty soon cause it looks epic
I am at home
If you open a server using this map you are making it would be awesome to play in this map
Will this be available on bedrock
Idea: how about makeing some custom mobs or bosses Comment and like if agreed
Can you release the WorldPainter version because me and my friends want to build the building our selves
It would be amazing if you added a Japanese building style for the snowy mountains
When you release this map, will you be able to download it on bedrock
You should add a burning sword
Can you imagine usw with mods?
How long did it take for you to make the USW ?
You should make it glowstone an gold instead of glowstone and cobble to make it realistic
yo blocks build battle ?
How do you zoom out like that and see you build
Okay, I'm going to have to bring this up since nobody else is. The whole dwarves-wardens situation is HORRIFYING, do you not see that? That's the EXACT story of every indigenous community in the world that has ever been colonized, people come from the outside and steal their land and their resources and when they fight back, they are framed as the bad guys. That's what my ancestors faced at the hands of British colonizers for two centuries. I'm genuinely disappointed in you, honestly. The fact that you're trying to make up so much lore for this (and taking "inspiration" from minority communities like the native Americans for the wolf chief, etc) but you don't have the minimum courtesy to at least think twice before glorifying colonization is absolutely pathetic.  And I say this as someone who rarely gets perturbed by people doing random stuff online. Sometimes things are mistakes, and that's understandable (I'm hoping that is the situation here as well, and I hope you will rectify this.) Also, I say this as someone who has generational trauma because of British colonizers. My family was directly affected by their actions and we had to flee our home country in disgrace and terror. All less than a century ago.  And before someone comes at me and goes "hurr durr this is Minecraft chill" or "grow up it's not that deep" yes, yes it IS that deep. I absolutely do not condone cancel culture and I have seen firsthand that people can change and rectify their mistakes (whether knowingly made or not) and I definitely do believe in teaching people when something they're portraying or glorifying is wrong, especially when they have such a huge platform.
He's gonna make literally everyone in the world play minecraft
Honestly, I'm not even going to build ANYTHING.  I'm just going to live in the jungle or savanna. Also, no automatic farms for me. I want to make sure I find the secrets and not like mess with anything, so I won't spawn any bosses or go to the nether unless he upgrades the nether (Bastion and nether fortress would be cool or even a village).
I am just blwn away, I am hoping Trixy makes a whole movie after the map is done!
Trixy you forgot about the swamp I think
What is your texture pack ?
Is there a bedrock map download?
Imagine something like this in Hytale. It looks incredible!
How much money will we need to pay if we want to download this world for ourselfs
wait if this ancient or not ancient if its ancient then why is it still working?
This is so cool
So... ahem.... where are all the likes?
trixy i loved this episode too ofc but what about swamps and birch trees
Can you make a little like starter map and spawn area in your world that would if you could build a map of the island just asking for that
You can't forget the nether
Imagine being able to build lmao
Please make the birch and mangrove as islands beside the main island from the usw if you do this it would make a lot of people so please do this
Which build is better? The desert pyramid or this cave of insanity?
Thank you for all the work, I love it!
Are you going to call this founders forge
For the next part what if you do a volcano in the snowy mountains? Just a thought
When is episode 8 coming out?
Where them like
Ide love to see a revamped swamp biom and birch biom, since those are being updated in the 1.19 update. It would be cool to see those.
Sooo amazing and inspiring!!!!
Hey Trixyblox, ever think you'll do a swamp revamp? I think you could really bring to life a crowded, debris-laden bog so thick you have to go by water, with mushrooms grown so large they nearly tower as large as the new mangrove trees. Probably wouldn't be in this world, since let's face it, swamp grass is ugly- but you could make a swamp village and even revamp the witch hut too! Food for thought ^^
Also, where can we download this map when it comes out?
This world is for java or bedrock
the fact this started because of a little mistake, scaling the world bigger than planned, and now we are getting these masterpieces
я один с украины???????????????????
Will you update the nether and end?
Are you building in the snow biome next
POV: you maxed out in creativity and talent
1:50 What happened with your voice? it cracked
it would be cool if the nether was the main island but nether
100% copper faction
Could you build a Viking themed village in the snowy mountains? With a cave with the world tree Yggdrasil?
I'd love to play this Map when it is done. It's so cool
Great job!
how are you able to move the statue around as a whole?
Do PewDiePie hardcore base
Mind blowing
Hey trixy I tried to make a big tree in the end and gat all of the roots and the trunk done but I have given up because I could not get the branches and leafs right maybe you could carry the torch for me and create the the massive tree yourself if you made a video of this you would really be making my day and please comment on this if your up for the task thank you so much for all of the effort and time you put into these amazing videos
Mom and dad said I have to get pinned
I can’t wait for the tiga and snowy mountain biome. I know he’ll deliver the best 👍
wtf thats so amacing
and put in the ship like some one fund this place and ther is a treasure and add some things  from your mind and how they died and thank you
pot in the deep dark city a  wrecked ships  it well be good i hope you like my idea
this is an absolutely beautiful build
H o l l o w K n i g h t ?
You really outdid yourself on this one.
I’ve found out bout this maybe 2 hours ago and have watched the videos backwards but I’m woundering if these will be on ps4 aswell when released? And is there a rough idea when it will be released?
When you end the world, will players be able to download it?
جميل
This man is insane
The first build in this cave transformation reminded me of nidavellir
So happy I was there every step of the way. Great applause to this madman for creating, in my opinion, the single coolest thing ever created in Minecraft. Can’t wait to see what he does next.
Can you please make it so bedrock players on PC and IOS or android can play the map i cant aford a PC
I've been wondering about when the Usw comes out will it be free? or will you have to pay to play it because even if you have to pay i will do it.
do the tiga next that is my favorite biome
Can you get it on concel edition when its done
no words. too epic
The dwarfs weren't living there, they were hiding. An ancient enemy will soon rise again, the preperations are almost complete.
Well done
also you should prophy update the build on some of the older builds like the desert, dark wood forest, plains and the mushroom swamp and if you don't want to well jeracraft updates his older builds and i think that these biomes need some updating
how about the other biomes since they sould also have some form of trading in orther to prosper like these kindoms
You should make the entire world with all of the continents. That would be awesome!
About halfway through I forgot this was Minecraft. I’m 99% sure this is a completely different game using Minecraft as a base...
I hope he does a massive Viking village for the snowy bit
*me: getting lord of the rings and the hobbit vibes*
Will you tackle the ocean biome as well? If you do I think it would be cool to have it half above sea level, and it be abandoned. Like a Minecraft version of the lost city of Atlantis!!🐠🐠🌊
Trixy why you are not transforming snowy and snowy tiga biome
Now I wanna try to build something like this in my survival, but not sure if I can generate something as awesome as this thing…
Idea: make some changes in the nether biomes as the others seem boring and that way you have a cooler adventure oh also the end needs upgrades and if you can... Can you remake the end city's? I will be glad and if not I already understand
Is this world available for mobile
now the question is... are ya gonna do the nether and the end as well?
Land Of Wano🤔
you really intend to make it, I like your content, continue my friend
I have a suggestion you should make a city in the sky on a cloud it would be cool
Video starts at 3:35
we would need vikings for the mountains
You should mod this so it is more realistic and has more animals.
WHEN IS
How long did it take you to learn how to build like this. Im amazed
No one. How impressive should the builds be?  TryxiBlox: Yes.
that ATLAS form mythology was great one to use
it would take me centuries even just copying this build, don't even think of building in survival
Oh god my pc can’t handle this
That dwarven statue is incredible
OH MY GOSH!!!!!!!! that final tour gave me chills!!!!!
I cant wait to play this world
bro you need to write a book series. im so in love with the lore you've created over this series and your other builds. you are so creative and so talented.
World*
Is this Minecraft is on the server I want to join in that wolrd
What seed did you use in this world
#TrixyBlox After you finishing the USW, Can you make a "Video Trailer" about every biome that lasts a few minutes what you did in this ultimate world, to show people in a few minutes what is USW and not sending 10 videos of 20 minutes+ and add before "Have you  heard about the Ultimate Survival World in Minecraft?" That will be very helpful
Question: Did you make already the Snowy Mountains and Taiga?
C'mon Mojang just hire this guy already.
Wow! this looks insane, but how is it possible to travel millions of blocks just to get to a different biome? that would take a very long amount of time
FüR fORtnITe
You haven´t got any hobbys bro
once its out you know ima download many mods to play ark in minecraft lmao
So assom dod 😊
17:20
Headcannon for the Dwarfs, they were inspired and dedicated their work to the God of Forges and Fires Hephaestus.
bro can make a badass game in source engine
hello algorithm if you would please get this vid more views thank you~
Are you going to recreate the End / Nether too? Doing one big fortress each, recreating the area with the dragon and the entrance of the portal Would be great, kinda wouldnt be complete, if the area with the final boss would be the old way , right
12:35
Collab with tango tek and customizing tektopia mod for better villagers specificly for this world would be like Minecraft 2.0
How do you make a lush cave look better than it already did
What about the swamp and mangrove biome?
yo is it done????
id join the copper faction cause i like weapons
Emperor ice kingdom
Please release!!!! I want to play itttt
Bruh this map can be role play
Make A very very very very GIANT SWORD ON THE CENTRE OF MAP DIGGING DOWN TO HELL AND CONNECT THE END OF THE SWORD DEEP DOWN TO NETHER
Making somthing like this even in creative is amazing
What if this guy joined hermitcraft
i absolutly love the ultamite survival world i love the way that trixiyblox to crate 1.1 scale builds  i think you shoud do the taiga i have some ideas a midevil castle a lumberyard and a taiga vilige on the coast whith a giant port plz put them in thanks
I'm still really hoping that after you have completed everything that somehow we will be able to get it all on console. It is by far the coolest I've seen to date, my sisters kids & I watch your builds all the time. Minecraft is there favorite game.
Where is the cave door?
how To download This World For Free 🥺
Nananananananananananana batman
Question, are you going to do the nether and the end
Next episode is an under water city
This mans creativity is built different
For the snowy biomes you could do a viking theme
For the snowy Mountains you should have a Legend like the wendigo.
I think this is my favorite biome yet!
Ur racist if you dont like my coment
I think you need to make them more city like. Some food shope, pet shops etc. It makes it seem more lively and fun
So hard to fond quality yt vids these days. This video was amazing and gave me so much inspiration
this series, as a writer, motivates me and inspires me so much so thank you and amazing job so far
What shaders do you use . It looks awesome.
just a quick question: will this be for free or locked through your patreon? i really would like to play this when it is finished!!
Hey what’s your say I heard that you’re making the entire Minecraft well where’s the ocean monument I mean there’s no ice in Monument kinda missing something big I mean why the elder guardians and I love the story and also I hope you’re having a good time see you bye
Pls do the sea next
This is one is my favourite build!
BEAUTIFUL!!!!
It's going to be pain in ass to destroy all those buildings that have the warden calling bloks on the roof to stop the warden appearing, I would recomend chanching the blocks to something else or putting bit much fever of thme on the cave
Went this is done I wanna see game theory do a video on the lore in this usw
This is Amazing!!
TAKE MY MONEY ALREADYYYYYY
I really hope you make this a very dangerous area or else we will have virtually unlimited ores
I have a question will there be npcs?
Mojang should hire this man
7:28... no actually, I really like the first one a lot more.... just gonna say it.,,
i’d really like a spartan and or viking part with the viking part you could maybe make large rivers and have wolfships(that’s what I think they are called lol). that would fit in with the cold themes of the last two biomes
I really love how the dwarves have this brain and brawn team
Would this be available on switch minecraft?
Just saying when you finish this project a hundred days would be much appreciated
Will it be free or do i have to Pay ?
@Minecraft should add this to its game but I don’t think they will because too much realism
Will you transform the nether and end?
I have a lot of ideas, so if you like one, please do it: you can add KRAKEN or sunken city.  I don't know if you can add new monsters or bosses, but it would be great if there was some kind of monster that only moves in groups and roams all the biomes!  You can make an underground mushroom kingdom where there are glowing mushrooms and maybe a new boss who is a huge mushroom that releases poison.  These are some of my ideas, if anyone likes them please like the comment.  😁😁😁
I can do better than that bruhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh lollloollooloo
is there going to be a nether transformatoin
OMG
im mostly wondering if you're going to release it on bedrock edition aswel once its ready for release
Once I get a PC which will probably only happen after this is all done. I most definitely am buying Minecraft Java to play on this world!
TB you are invited to my minecraft server acne smp the of my server is blue magic and you are invited the name of my channel is blue magic also the day i don 't year 'idon 't know too i sing this year or 2023 or 2024 or 2025 or 2026
Are you going to add custom mobs for each of the towns and city’s along with the biomes?
Idk if ur able to do this. But it would be super cool if u could add in ur own soundtrack of different themed background music for all the different biomes when ur in them.
Hi Trixy, I think it would be awesome if there was a secret or secluded society that was technologically and architecturally advanced with buildings like the main High Rise invasion building.
Is this going to be a server or something?    By the way this is the first time I see one of this videos, so I would be very grateful if someone could update me
Im hoping someone will make a modpack that would add more immersion and mobs to make this world a Legendary adventure
Im just hoping tlauncher has this if it doesnt im flippin buying minecraft and buying this mans patreon to get this
Great video, even though it didn't end up being what I was hoping for. I was expecting the snow area(s). Maybe next time? |-°)
This is amazing! Are you upgrading the End and the nether as well?
in the taiga have a fox tribe like you hade a wolf tribe in the savannah
i se spedruns on this
I deadass will subscribe to the patreon just so I can play this
This is amazing! You are an admirable man!
You should add a mangrove swamp island when the update eventually comes  out it would be amazing to explore 😀
Wow your USW is looking amazing! Can't wait to see your next addition!
You should build berk (how to train your dragon).
When this map is completed can we play it in pocket edition minecraft
This guy is making better things than mojang themselves
Hey trixyblox I know your planning to just work on the last 2 biomes but I also think a sky civilization with also be interesting to see
Please make a Iceland and water
Is this bedrock playable
I love your work :)
Can you please tackle the Illager factions
@Mojang Hire Him Please
I wish I could play it for free my mom won't let me buy ur Patreon 😢
Hey, now that you've done the underground of the ultimate survival world, I was wondering if you would also build a legendary sky kingdom with angel warriors and so... Would be sick!👌😍
large dwarf statue.... funny
Your work is awesome...   what have you think for Nether & End & Endcities... ❤️❤️❤️
wow that is amazing 👌
I couldn't focus because the tune in the background reminds me of Myth & Roid's Forever lost so much XD  My brain is trying to listen to it but them goes ,,nah, that's not it" and tries again
Custom npcs need to be a thing
woww when I look at it back it looks like Fortnite Battle Royale Map😂🤣🤣
can you meke a under water abandon city please
Video starts at 3:37
I legitimately want to live there oml that’s so cool!!!!
Try it with rtx on
swamp biome ?
I love how the dwarf is the tallest statue😅 Anyways great video as usual. You never disappoint 🥰
Heres my ideas for the end the stronghold will look like a under ground temple as for the end the obsidion towers can look like hands and for the end city you can make it taller and bigger and a bigger end ship and end villages for the endermen
Heres my ideas for the nethire you cand restore the nethire fortress and bastion and nethire villages for the inhaditents of the nethire
I have a good idea for the nethire and the end
While your down there.....
Kind of wishing that the series was in order instead of last to first
You should ad some npcs that fit with each biome by using mods or something
Epic is the only word
Would there be ANY way to get this world on bedrock, holy hell it is so nice  On Xbox One X to clarify
I hope someone makes a mod pack to go with this map!!!
Your Dragon City link isnt working.
Will you also upgrade the nether?😌  All the stories behind fortress and bastions and end will be amazing if u do so😌🔥
One question? Why are you making the warden a boss like mob? It’s supposed to be a mob you have to avoid I’d like it if skulk shriekers were uniquely found in those rooms and you have to be quiet and get the loot but if your not well… you know what happens
Put it on the marketplace!!! (When done)
This will be insane to play especially with questcraft releasing. Playing this in car will make it even more insane. This is so cool
please transform the nether
Wow, its unbelieveable... I'm in ORE......
finally some representation of my fellow dwarfs!!!!! DWARFS RISE!!!!
When can we buy the USW also when you post it please make sure that it on console: xbox, switch
Hey in the tiagra you should make a north west town
Hey are you still going to use some of Minecraft’s old canon?
Respect this man’s hard work
He actually risked the world With snapshots, Snapshots are buggy so I’m surprised that he actually use the 1.19 snapshots
The hoe be like: I feel left out
nice lip gloss pufta
Absolutely insane
hey will you replace the crimson wood with real skulk blocks when 1.19 comes out
Title: This is fortnite
how do i get all those ores glowing like that?
almost 40% sub rating? duuuude, most people that comment on that, are like at the 5% mark, you're doing FANTASTIC based on what all I've seen....
And the sea temple?
This is pure insanity
Is there going to be a mod?
Dude this is crazy
In the snowy mountains, can you make the ice castle from frozen?
Now build this on a mountain surrounded by waterfalls, it kinda looks like want from one one piece
I would love to see beta testers play on your maps they are amazing
I have a question. Do the Dwarves pick which faction they're in? Or are they just born into a faction and they stay there.
Bro sow nice
This is the best upgrade so far! Good Job!!!😍😍😍
i wish i could find a youtuber with a survival sieries on this
I'm sure, youve already thought of this, but just in case you haven't. Instead of risking using the possibly currupting snapshots, use placeholder blocks. Specifically those update blocks, that just have the dirt texture, and green text, that says "update", and use those, that will correlate to the blocks, you want them to be after the update. Or just use modded placeholder blocks, and change them after the update.
Mans playin in Minecraft 2
Deadass the best builder on minecraft EVER everything he makes just has the most beautiful,  playable and just lore heavy builds ever
Minecraft should come to your channel so you be a developer builder
Ngl this man should design the maps for hypodermic skyboock
I'm sorry, but that intro music sounds way too much like a Ford truck commercial, and it ruined it for me :(
How about the stronghold
You sure got some patients
Are you gonna do something to the nether, stronghold, and end?
Can we play this on 1.16?
How to download this map to minecraft? I m really excited to try it
What happens if we don’t hit the like goal?
We won’t be able to dig straight down because we have no idea where it is.
You should add your own biomes like a volcanic biome cause what else created the island, Plus you can use the lava ponds in the overworld for it, Cave of a dead dragon which could be the creature of the bone tribe's skull.
THE HECK?! YOU SOUND LITERALLY JUST LIKE TOMMYINNIT!
When Will the mod be realeset?
are those mobs, NPCs, or mods I mean the dwarves, and by special loot does that mean special loot through mods or just normal vanilla loot?
:0               its too good to say too good
i know this seems insignificant in the grand scheme of things but i never noticed how well gold ore blocks and glow stone go together. it literally looks like molten gold. kra-zee
Map link please
mumbo jumbo x trixyblox
Will you have villagers in all the biomes and villages?
I have followed this since it began, and I keep getting more and more stoked to experience this amazing world you are creating! Great Job Man! Keep it up!!!!
Playing as Guts on this map will be wonderful
I want to this mod
We have same name btw :3
Dude!! You should really try the Create Mod to make some of your decorative machinations *actually* work!! Like the Trains in the Messa biome. The conveyors, etc. It would look even cooler since they actually function!!!
Does this world have ore generation as well?
Hi, I would like you to make all the city of Nosgoth from the game "Blood Omen 2".
How to download it
When can we download this?????
This is the best build you built on the ultimate survival Island it's amazing.
make it freeeeeeeeeeeee
Image if he did this in hardcore😱😱😱
And can you add class and races and what race you choose that’s where you spawn and make a faction war and costume armor and weapons please.
those streams of molten gold have to be my favorite addition to this build, rly standing out in the scenery :D
Looks a little bit similar to Mata Nui island xD
Would love to see an East-Asian theme (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) in a future build!
Ohhhhhhhhhh😮😮😮😮😮😬😬
I want this
will it be free tho?

Pls make it a hardcore adventure
I would love to see some kind of Roleplay Gameplay after everythink is completed😍🔥
Is this avail in bedrock if you realeas it
amogus
Request: transform a 9 year olds first minecraft build        (Just an ore block house)
I wish I could build that good but like that’s ever going to happen lol but these builds are so cool and I could never build anything close to what these look like
Ayo is that wano?
mans a literally god. I need this world.
Just when I thought this man couldn’t make Minecraft any cooler or anymore detailed he proves me wrong
This man builds mega structures easily wile I have trouble building a floating island
You ment 18000000 spired mile
"... And we're not even done yet." "Final Additions: *proceeds to list at least 2 worlds worth of work in 8 bullets...*"  Thank you for all the work you're both doing on this world for your supporters. It is truly magnificent what you and Steph have accomplished with this USW. Amazing. Thank you.   My favorite part is your planning. Wow.
So just to be clear, if I subscribe to the diamond tier, I will be able to download all the worlds on bedrock? Also has anyone tried downloading them onto an iPad or other apple device?
How are you so good
Hey Trixyblox, are you planning to have a modpack built around the USW?
Question: will this world have Mod support?
You need to host a server, where you let the players experience the story with NPC´s and missions
This inspires me to work on my oc lore 💀  Great video and designs!!
Love this series, would you be upgrading the. Nether ikr the ocean biomes like the coral reefs and adding shipwrecks?
I want this but my mom will not let me get the pack 😭😭😭😭
I`ll never belive that you are not building the island of Mata Nui
Is there any download for this world bro
Dude, what you did is INCREDIBLE. I can't wait to try it !
u should so do this in survival lmao
whens the download coming?
one day the minecraft channel is going to comment on this, if it hasn't happened already that is
can you pleas customice a Part of the Nether too ?
I wish i have minecraft but i am poor
Man this is all very cool but do you get time to sleep like you building this for us but your doing this 24/7 like sleep for a month without making these videos pls you will be tired
I don't know if you already plan about it but i think for us, players, that it would be great and add an objective to add some "adventurers notes" that could be last writtens marks of adventurers, those books could save some of the lore of this world. Like one or two books per villages to know some of the relations between thems and their history. Maybe you already plan about something like that but i ask whatever (sorry if i have bad english btw).
are we allowed to download the map for free when its ready
And now imagine he makes an insane RPG Minecraft Server based on that
This is absolutely incredible Trixy. You should be proud of what you’ve made. I’m about to buy your patreon
#mojang @mojang HIRE THIS GUY
Make a server out of it !!!
Actually the dwarfs have a class system aswell cuz just because the classes arent the capitalism classes it doesnt mean it isnt another system. This one is conservatistic in the elders ruling and stufying and the younger ones working. We have the upper class in the elders and the lower class in the youngers. The only difference is that its easier to climb through the classes
next ep soon pls
If we wanted to play this world with mods, generally how well will that function? I'm certain mod ores wont generate but what about modded mobs?
I like mining so I think of myself as a dwarf. Now, to the point, where can I find the entrances?
Why do the hierarchy sound like it's from arcane⬆️↗️⬆️↗️⬆️↗️⬆️
i hope it has the bedrock version of this maps:)
i hope i got rlly good pc so i can use these shader
I can't wait
But when we will have this map to download
Yes
Imagine adding tinkers mod to this
The way he does it so fast scares me
Wow nice map 🎉🎉🎉👏👏
Its like if Minecraft had a DLC
"Yeah we added the wardens as mini bosses to keep you guys entertained"  *wardens laugh in being the most powerful mob in the game currently*
I swear this is just absolutely beautiful, awesome looking, and will revolutionize Minecraft when complete.

Snowy mountain
Can you build the snowy mountain village
Next snowy mountain
Please know you mount the next
Dam all you gotta do now is make a mod for it
Video starts at 3:35
Maybe someday that humongous continent can have a mysterious island where there are many creatures that thought that went extinct millions of years ago.
nice!
Will there be a nether?
I hope there's a good survival mod that'll work well with this. I feel like Minecraft's current survival gameplay doesn't match the depth of the USW's worldbuilding and scale
hjg
yii
iiy
Will you upgrade the Nether?
You need to do the nether. Its practicly a part of the USW, Since you got a nether portal in the middle...
I know you just did the mine but can you do a mother underground structure it the cave village it just a village underground but it’s like attack on titan it’s got lots of walls and some are full of zombies that took over the other villages
This is the best minecraft build I have ever seen in my life. You’ve made some really great stuff but this is your best. I haven’t seen anyone build as good as you so far.
You should definitely add scattered dungeon throughout the entire world, that would be awesome
i wonder how long each individual area took to build
I’m on bead rock can I still join when it’s done?
You have to add things that look like the elven kingdoms in lord of the rings
I would love seeing something like this in wynncraft
You should leave the snowy mountain biome for the Vikings. Also, love your work and keep up what you're doing.
I want to see Kaer Morhen from The Witcher in either the Taiga or Snowy Mountains. I think it would make a really cool addition to either area, as well as add extra lore.
video starts at 3:35 until there, its just sponsor and explain
UGH I CANT WAIT FOR THIS MAP TO RELEASE T A K E M Y M O N E Y
since the dwarves are good weapon makers you should add special enchantments to some of the weapons you can find on the forging tables, like sharpness 7 or high unbreaking abilities
ratio ratio ratio ratio
ratio =pi no desimal
i got 1.19 on May 1st
Will you be upgrading the nether or end worlds?
This is awesome man good job
HOLY SHIT
Can you make a floating island up in the sky it would be very cool
I can not wait to download the usw    Keep it up man
It would be cool if you built a Ice castle
Keep up the good work I can’t wait to play
You KNOW that if you get this island online that its not going to last even a WEEK right? i mean everithing is somehow going to be destroyed by some dudes or that people place blocks everywhere bc pvp's yknow
Maybe to one of the other forests, i have an idea:  a mysterious forest exists somewhere in the usw world, and a part of it had trees which only existed there. The trees had amazing properties making the people from other biomes wanting to chop down the trees and use it. But there was a tribe that tried their best to protect the trees, which most propably was their home, but when i mean trying their best, they went so far they made a disaster that killed thousands of people.
Can’t wait for it, one of the reasons I’m getting into Minecraft again
Can you copy the map into Berock edition plsssss 🥺🥺
PLEASE JOIN HERMITCRAFT U WOULD BE SO GOOD ON IT!!!
I think it would be much nicer if you include the nether
When will it be possible to download ?
This is amazing!!!! It must've taken a long time to make.
Wow
You're beautiful and I  jealous.
The video start in 3:37 for god sake stop all the bla bla bla + sponsors shit and get in to it
ummmmmm, what about the nether and end. triple the amount of work. though i recking you could make a really cool nether fortress.
i cant believe its been 10 months already. this build has become something better than minecraft itself
Please snowy Mountains  🥺🥺
no way this guys straight
you are really good at building
I love the way you build these different  mega builds. I can't wait to play in it.
bye the pits kasadun its beautiful!!
im new to your videos but im already hooked in. Your amazing at this, Keep it up.
We should definitely do the Taiga biome. I dunno if this would be possible, but maybe we can go for a Viking theme for it. Taigas usually have a few or several mountains and Vikings usually have their villages nearby them.  Edit: y'all have to help me reach the 250k like goal if you want it in motion.
i cant dowland it
The amount of patience he has is insane
i read the Percy Jackson seizers and Atlas is the father of Zoe Nightshade, he holds the burden of holding the crushing weight of the sky
Trixy,will building be ok on the main island
That deepslate frame is actually Minecraft trolling us with amogus
This map that's been work on is incredible i wish to know where to find it so i can play it in minecraft.
Great job Trixy it looks really nice.
where is the cave located?
Can you make a update to I.18 because I just bought it I can’t downloaded it
You can ask someone to make a mod to change villager trades and textures according to biomes, NPCs that help uncover the story and maybe new animals...
a lot of hobbit vibes! i love it :) beautiful
Just two more!
Can I experience this on bedrock?
Definitely not me staying up all night waiting for updates from this series
I don't even play minecraft, but I'm hyped for this
ANYONEelse MILDLY annoyed that the hammer providing th lava isn't centered behind the kneeling statue?
amethyst, easily
Jj
Hjk
Ukl
Zhj
J
I love your videos but why my guy,why do you keep So long
Japanese structures for the mountains plz
Damnnn
Nice  And keep working
Well done and great artistic work, but you missed a perfectly good chance to make a hanging city for your dwarves.
I really like this addition to the world. I do have some suggestions though. I think for the Copper Faction you should add copper into their roofs and for the Amethyst Faction you should add some purple blocks if the amethyst blocks are too much. I feel like this would help differentiate the two sides easier at a quick glance and add something fresh to the build. Another suggestion is to add more big caves if you aren't planning to already and they don't have to be as big or detailed unless you want to do that. I really enjoy this series. Keep up the good work bro!
I wish I could build like this but I've got a bit to practice. BUT, these videos are amazing and i love all the timelapses in these videos. And Imagine a whole team doing this.
Mojang should make U first builder of Minecraft. You are absolutely genius. If Minecraft would look like ur USW i think whole world want to play this game. Cheers from Poland :)
So can we get a modpack customized for this???? Something like ancient warfare 2 + minecolonies and some dialogue mods
I can't wait until this world releases
I can't wait! When should we expect this to be released?
Can i download this for bedrock ver?
Trixyblox pls make it free so your viewers who cant buy it to play pls trixyblox
:o
USW deserves a new name imo or maybe initials that means ultimate survival world and another thing like Unis Salvos Wahan or something like that in another language that wouldn't break the immersion if the initals are mentioned in the world i don't think i'm clear
While I really enjoy what you have created here, I have one major thing I think about: the statues. They do look magnificent, yes. But I think having another group build a statue of your leader, depicting them kneeling and 'below' their own would probably be seen as a major insult to yourself. (the way the statues are currently placed could even be seen as some kind of execution scene) I think a less politically difficult approach would be to place the other statues a bit further out, standing and holding the lava flows from above, this would definitely lead to fewer tensions between the different groups. (that is just my opinion. I am not an expert in politics nor on statues. Maybe you have another, even better idea on how to make this build even greater)
you are unbelievably good at building!! the contrast of the purple amethyst banners with the yellow glow berrys and the orange copper banners with the blue roofed buildings is just beautiful!! i cant believe you're this good at building and im so glad that you're sharing this with the world and eventually making it available to play!part of me doesnt want it to be done so i can keep seeing all of these amazing builds in progress but the other part of me is extremely eager to see the end result!!!! keep doing what you're doing, its amazing!!!!!!!!!!
An RP server of this once it’s done would be EPIC.
Trixy: releases world Everyone: DOWNLOADDOWNLOAD
Amazing!
What's the name of the shaderpack?
I would like the snowy Mountains next PLEASE !!!!!!!🥺🥺🥺
I watched the first episode when it was just uploaded, all of the episodes are so great! I'm so exited!
Minecraft in 463636363 be like
Bro that is amazing!
Every video, he never ceases to amaze, I mean wow, just wow
is there be a  mod for this?
bro as respect for your build you need to be called the god of building in Minecraft
every new video i go, no way then i believe and then until another video comes out im gonna go no way again.  Trixy raises the bar every video, and once USW is done, expectations will just keep on soaring and soaring, higher and higher than the last build.
damn i can never build this 😣
oh my
I think the Snowy Biomes need to have a cool, story no pun intended Like a Frost Queen or King
you should partner up with a mod programmer to make this like a fully fledged mmo world too!
Can you please upgrade the strongholds
homie how are you not on hermitcraft your skills are incredible and your deffinetly family friendly from what I've seen
look really pretty remembered when the u started this series off
My guy made voya nui
How about transportation its gonns be hard and theres on ly 1 village per biome
You could build something in the cave to show the effect of all the smoke
Hire Daniel Kraft to make you custom mobs
Bit too flat??
Can you make a warden cult in a ancient cave
Absolutely stunning, I’m amazed by how beautiful and how much you can create within this game. Keep up the good work!
If I download the world, can I make my own DLC? all rights requested of course.
Holy fucking shit the statues are fucking insane!!! That's amazing!
If  amphibia was in minecraft
You guys are awesome.
We responding a different biom
You should make it where we were randomly spawned into a biome and when we die we have a week to join back and when we join back responding in a different biom
I think you should put in a god of war reference because I get god of war vibes when I watch the usw
we waited 1 month and you do caves instead of what we ask for like where drowns live or yeah please read your comments
Please, when you finish this project, I would love to see you making the entire Middle-earth from the Third Age of the sun and Valinor. You could talk with scholars and base the model on Tolkien's artworks and Peter Jackson's movies
How big is this hole? Would be greatly appreciated to know!
I wonder if he will do anything with the nether, have some sort of ruined portal which once’s repaired leads to a nether city
This is fuckin amazing!!🤩
What about the mushroom biome
Will the map have a separate patreon tier ?
Is it available on switch
Command block mobs?
Elven place next????? It looks great btw.
This series ist so great 🙃
Amazing. Just amazing.
Why not add lore cuz then creators can make lore videos on it even tho i love all the builds 😁🙃
is this world for free? =D
This is going to be so freaking amazing once it's complete and out in public. Have you come up with a price yet? And do you have any plans for the nether and end?
That’s insane
@TrixyBlox You are an absolute god at what you do! 🙌 Very well done sir!
It looks unique it’s really cool
This would be really cool to put like 10-25 people in each biome and just watch everything go down
I just wish he would make this survival world free 😞 dream that wont come true
This gives me lord of the rings vibes
Hey this was uploaded on my dads birthday!
I am so super exited for the usw it looks and sounds super cool. Don’t stop ceep going
How to train your dragon vibes
Cut you make the ocean
the statues look SICK bro!!!
This gives me hobbit vibes
will you put the map to public download or do we have to pay to get the map
A tutorial on that dwarf statue would a so cool, would love to have that in my world.
Will this be java bedrock crossover
When will it be ready?
Watching all your builds for the USW series makes me feel like that I don't even want to break a single block when the server is active because it'll be destroying a master piece.  Quick question: would you also be letting bedrock players join the world also or only Java?
fr can they stop adding new mobs
Where can I download this map ? :O its amazing
What system do I need to play this, damn!
For the snowy mountains a Himalayan temple could be cool
@TrixyBlox i need thus question answered. If i buy the patreon for one momth to get the usw map, will i be able to play it aftrr my subscription is over??
TrixyBlox when you give the world download can you also put it on marketplace because us bedrock players want to play on it too! If not that's okay :( (He prob wont even read this lol)
Question tho- how do you film these????
Finally ⚡
Communist dwarves
This is amazing your build is awesome when this map will be release because i want to play it is this also bedrock edible because my minecraft is bedrock not java
AMMAZING😃
This guy has way too much time
so beautiful!!
This guy is so underrated tbh
Bro i love mythology so i'm really glad you added dwarves  Im too hyped for this map say goodbye to my GB when this releases
Minecraft should make this the tutorial world
This world will be the most beautiful world
When is this going to be released
oh my god. this is insane. ur insane. this is so damn cool
It just completely blows my mind how you can do all of this
It would be so cool if to get to this place the tunnels that are connected to the cities above were actually mazes and only those who are "worthy" can go through the maze
Please make a volcano island in the next episode
Will this be downloadable on bedrock edition? If so, I would like it if you made it free on the Minecraft store!!
Next the nether and end
Man your imagination is amazing
you consistently  blow my mind
U can name the tiga biome evil civilization who discovered the Nether Portal and help the Nether monsters to come in the original world
I think, when the whole project is done and dusted, a good shader (maybe even a mod) that creates specific atmospheres for all the environments would give this already jaw-dropping project a gigantic boost. For example: Thick dark fog in the woodlands, no clouds in the desert, a purple haze lingering in the mushroom swamp. Also..custom islands?   I also honestly think, that if someone took the time to create a couple plug-ins or mods, combined with the USW's immersive story and amazing areas teeming with atmosphere, I see the potential for a huge roleplaying SMP. Imagine world of warcraft, but with the flexibility of Minecraft's template. Of course, it would require immense resources to maintain, with a wide array of moderators and active server-hosts, but the implications would be huge. Imagine, different races (similar to the origins mod) with all of them residing in one part of the map, clans of warriors, knights, druids with differing abilities and ranks, like the nature centred magic of the jungle-mages, or the destructive powers of the bone tribe's shamans. With independent cultures, with their own goals and histories, the possibilities could be truly endless. You could also apply certain anti-griefing measures, like not allowing certain items to be used unless the player wielding them has a specific role (like a dwarven weaponsmith being allowed to use lava).   Just imagine: You get the greenlight to join the server, and you get directed to a selection menu, where you can pick your race and profession, with all the pros and cons of your selected class, as well as which culture you will join. You pick your role as a dwarven weaponsmith, and you are spawned into the great underground city, with the starting level of 1. You get a humble little shed, and you begin working. Your higherups give you assignments, and you carry them out. First, you are tasked with transporting metals from the mines to the great furnaces and sorting the smelted ores into their respective storage facilities. As you are promoted to level 2, you are overseeing the crafting and smelting processes, making sure the coal never runs out, and that the iron is turned into pickaxes instead of hoes. You progress higher and higher, and as you reach the higher ranks, you are introduced to the application of special kinds of enchantments, or dwarven blessings, that give dwarven armour their characteristic capabilities that distinguish them as the highest forms of craftmanship. But you may feel that this life underground doesn't really suite you as well as it once did, do you spread your wings. You venture out to the surface and seek out the greatest order of knights in the realm, and offer your special service, in exchange for high pay and a knighthood. As you can access special enchantments in the enchanting table due to your high status as a dwarven weaponsmith (this is achievable by pretty non-intrusive, complementary mods), your skills would greatly benefit the order, so they take you on, and you provide them with special enchantments for their weapons, while you get the prestigious life of a knight. Now imagine, that there are hundreds of players like you, who are all trying to make their way up the ranks in their respective fields, and you begin to see the level of fun this map could provide.  This is merely a conservative view on what an amazing experience it would be to participate in such a grand world. If we wanted to take it a little further, we could even introduce new types of weapons, armour, or food, but these are of course just speculations. The point is, if this concept were to actually manifest itself, this world would provide the basis for one of the most ground-breaking, and entertaining servers in Minecraft history.   That is a pretty wild idea, but i is fun imagining what a server akin to WoW would look like in a sandbox type game like Minecraft, and especially on this map:)))
I think after this he would costomize nether
I wish this could be added into the Minecraft store so we could download it on like gaming consoles   that would be fun and I would definitely get it.Anyone who reads and agrees leave a like!
Awesome 😎
I’ve been watching this for MONTHS but I’m still not sure if he’s going to transform the nether and end too… Anyone know??
mahn if u need actors for the mini showcase just hit me up😉 I'm being serious...
he just said the wardan a mini mob!  lol wardan is the strongest mob it can kill u in prot 4 neterite armour
Everytime I think there isn't much to improve, I stand corrected. This is insane!
then creeper spawning everywhere and start exploding 1by1
i really hope he’s getting paid for all his hard work every time i catch a vid i’m more in awe
Every video is better than before
I’m new here so how do I enter in this world to play?
I'm just imagining getting a group of 100 or so people and running the world according to the lore
This is amazing
Bro I just wanna see cities in the surface
Sick one
Will there be a seed for this whole ultimate survival world once the work is finished?
Could u try and make a Mandolorean map
I SO hope you're gonna make a buddhist monastery on one of the remaining biomes Q_Q
wow its been 10 months. time sure has passed. i feel like i just remember you designing the map
gib.
dude every time you post one of these I'm endlessly impressed by the amount of detail you put into these, the dedication that must take is incredible. also I used to LOVE dragon city as a kid, it's so cool u got a sponsorship w/ them.
playing this with mods would be mind-blowing
What’s the point in saying “I will continue the series if I get 250 000 likes” it’s not like he’s gonna give up on a 10 month project that has made him a bunch of revenue
Wow.
How do the undrground people know when to sleep?
WOW! Cave City its beatiful
How about the ocean give it a little bit of life
This reminded me of Blackreach from Skyrim
would it be possible to have this in hardcore? that would be fun and cool! :)
Question Is this in Java and Bedrock addition
I like what you build very much but i feel like some spaces are very very empty and dont look as if poeple live there
Have you got a video on how to become better at building, as in how to be like more creative, I don't think I can make a really good beautiful house without a video, I would like a breakdown on how to get better at building, e.g. houses, builds. (Main one I'd like is Houses)
The way you build is how I see my builds in my head but it never works out that way lmfao great job looks amazing
will it be singleplayer or multiplayer
I might steal your statue designs, bonkin
the statues !! fire! damn TrixyBlox can build, and he has shown it through all these years! "WOW!" is all I can get out of my mouth ...
Is this gonna be downloadable for bedrock
Dude is like gold finger if he touches the mouse and go into Minecraft he will totally change the dame thing
OG in chat
Whats the deal w mon spawning down there
Does anyone know if the underground in the other biomes as well as mountains will have ore veins, or do just the custom mines have ores?
When you start working on the nether, what if you made two piglin-inhabited structures. 1: A ruined Blackstone Bastion (probably make it more castle-like.) 2: A wealthy rich Quartz and Gold City. I have played with the idea in a creative world, Oxidized copper looks really good for a roof in the nether.
Nice
at 14:00 those big banners could be "family banners" each ancient dwarven bloodline has a banner that each member of the family add an embroidery piece too when they come of age.
... wtf.. this was fucking awesome! I loved it wayyyyy to much! I just want to explore it and live there. I am in just pure shock on how beautiful it is.
The next biome can be taiga by my opinion.
Do this caves have ores ?
You are an architect, story teller, producer, screenwritter, youtuber and if you use nft you'll be a millionaire. You are a TRUE Artist!!
i love ur builds but personally i wish there was a little less large-scale symmetry
I like monster legends more
I wonder if the nether is included in this series.
It is realy nice buut it would be cooler if you made the dwarfs home like the hobbit ore something like that. Sorry for my bad english but im from belgium.
Bro this guy makes my day
*Adventure Time*
while watching i noticed a face on top of the fire in the timelapse 12:14
That incredible
hey trixy can you also pls let us download for free pls🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I'm getting this the second it gets out ommmgggg it looks incredible!!!!!!!!
What if this guy was in hermitcraft
Interns of the end for the dragon and the end
You should do a collab with Jerracraft
talent
This is going to be amazing to play, I can only imagine what it'll be like the first time through.  And then modding it for the second
THANK YOU. I IMAGINE TO BUILD THIS BUT IM VERY BORING TO BUILD. BUT YOU BUILD IT WHAT I MIND. VERY THANKSSS
Now emagine this with mods to make it EVEN BETTER
Can i download this insane map ?
i cant wait for the map to release its very beutifull its even better than pro builders and ur a GOD builder! this map is gonna be awsome when in release
Correction: Ultimate SUSSY World*
Fun fact: here in Germany,  "usw" stands for "etc"
This is brilliant and all but don't forget to go out and touch some grass everyonce in a while
Come on Tiger and snOw
Imagine exploring this map in vr
I feel like without an availability of npc options, the map is gonna feel kind of empty. Might have to set up the world on a server in some sort of Wynn craft style
Now, don’t be shy, show us it without shaders and invisible item frames 😏
Random suggestion: since there’s now a underground ancient city, I would love to see an ancient sky city. Kinda inspired like the country Nepal 🇳🇵 and a heaven feeling inspired by Ancient Greek architecture.
will the usw be available to all patreons or just the gold/Dimond teirs
I'm ngl you gotta be one of the top 100 Minecraft builders
It would be so cool he he got someone to program custom mobs. So the area would have dwarves that actually live in the city.
I’m guessing this was a different Pharaoh and not the mad evil one? Lmao  This is seriously amazing
I can't believe it had been 10 months
This is so insane. You both are so talented. The builds are so talented and creative, with so much inspiration from so many irl places and cultures, and tie it all together perfectly. Great stuff.
It would be cool to see parts of the Dark Souls world and/or the Elden Ring world in Minecraft, done by Trixy of course.
Brilliant build, amazing effort on everyone's part (the build, backstory, etc.), and overall just an amazing video
Best transformation of the series yet. I cant wait to see the world finished
make the swamp biome around the mushroom island and make the mangrove swamp at the end of the swamp with glowing mushrooms and fireflies (✯ᴗ✯)
will it be playable for bedrock?
This guy NEEDS 5 million subscribers! He is insane at building!
Whats the Shaderpack you use for your videos
Only one problem with the USW… How could I build anything other than an eyesore compared to your magnificent builds???
3:05 hur hur challanges
Did he seriously use an unlit camp fire for the bellows eyes!? This man's mind always amazes me
I hope he makes more biomes in every update that has one
dwarven statue tutorial ?
What about the nether???
rootin 4 u dood, cant wait to play this once its completed. This map is gna make me play mc again
He deserves more likes 🤦
Will the final product going to be free or not, and if not how much?.. thank you
I have. A question I accidentally misheard something and now I don’t believe I know where the entrance is 😅
at this point. i wont be surprised if he recreated the entire nether for this world.
quick suggestion, the taiga can be japanese themed
I seriously hope some YouTubers do a blind playthrough of this or something. This seriously looks incredible
What shaders is this
IVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A GOOD BUILDER LIKE YOU TRIXY!!!!
You should totally add your own armor, tools, and other stuff that would make the world come alive! Just a suggestion, if you weren't planning to, you don't have to.
Will this also be available for bedrock edition?
This is the besttttt world everrrr
Yes it be great idea to make your kingdom under a huge mass of unstable spikes ;)
Will you be modifying the end + end city? A crazy castle would be insane if you can make it out of blocks that the dragon cannot remove. Or just have a command block function so that it cannot destroy blocks
THIS IS SO FRICKING EPIC MAN
Make a nether portal tutorial
Ik this might seem like idc but how do we claim the rewards in dragon city?
I think this might be my favorite biome. Also, it is cool if you added two or three extra ones. My thoughts would be an under the sea, sky island, and archipelago. Not huge like the others but more like a DLC type of thing once the map is done. Keep up the good work.
Imagine this stuff was built in survival mode… imagine the collecting… the math… the finding… the building… all of it! In SURVIVAL mode.
Is he doing the nether and the end too?
ohh this is gonna be a banger
Diggy hole *intensifies"
Damn that seed is beautiful
Eyo is that Hephaestus
will i need minecraft on the computer to use this world?
is this on the ps4?
Definitely my favorite build so far yet. I'm always amazed how you manage to top yourself over and over again in so many different ways. Thx for your work and inspiration!
When are you releasing this download to your Patreon?
maybe when you do the snowy parts you can put a snowy village turned into a Viking village with a big wall around it with archer towers at each corner...
Karl would be proud!
Suggestion: For the Snowy Mountains on the highest peak can you make a ICE DRAGON that guards treasure in a long forgotten altar of the Snow Mountain People.
Really cool build wish I would be able to play it when it comes out but I have bedrock but epic build! 🙂🙃
Minecraft should buy this from you and make it a type of world you can select on the both Bedrock and Java
I've been following this project moderately closely and I must say this is an incredibly creative project. I'm usually not one for selling Minecraft worlds but man this really fits.
Does each faction have their theme around a specific material? The Copper and Amethyst factions makes me think of the Desert for Gold, Jungle for Emeralds, Bone Tribe, Outlaws’ TNT, and Witches’ potions.  Is this on the money or a shot in the dark?
How about for the snowy mountains it’s like Mount Everest with camps along the way up
SEGREGATION
Reminds me of the hobbit. I love the Erebor style upgrade
Really cool
I am so excited to play on this map with my friends
OMG! This looks great! + THERES A LIBRARY!!!!!!!! Heh yeah uh I’m probably going too live there and study history, lol Your just sooooo good at this! It looks good even with no mods! Good luck on building all of the other things.
i already play dragon city lol
Can you download this on bedrock?
All I can say is wow
The Gordon Ramsay of Minecraft
How long did it take you to build the entire island?
imagine having your base in this cave. fly around with your elytra to everything you need.
how do i play in this world omg
You fogot the swamp biom and mushrooms biom
How much will the map cost to us?
is this map survival friendly
O M G
Omg yes take my money please even make a beta i would play
Is this java? I want to play with my family on this island but I only have java
Trixy 🤝 being an architectural genius
bro ur INSANE
l
One thing's for sure... this guy must work with mojang in designing minecraft.
is it gonna be free
I wanna play in this Map so bad...
bro, you have been doing insane but this build takes the cake. i cant wait to play this man
The copper faction makes me so sad that we didn’t get copper golems
i like to think about how much lord of the rings you would have had to watch for this build lmao
It’s insane bro massive respect
I... I... wha... and... ya. I can't word after watching this! This is mind blowing!
I can imagine you git this comment a hundred times now, but did you know, that "USW" in german is the short version of "und so weitet" which means "and so on"
Nether
dwarf not short enough
can i play your maps on xbox?
That is awesome!
I can't wait for the time when he releases this for us to download
My potato pc would never load this amazing beautiful world
SO.. this is basicly Erebor from the hobbit
The age of Dutin BEGINS!
hey trixy, think smaller! Not all builds have to be huge!
download size is probably gonna be equivalent to GTA V
But when can on bedrock edition
IDIOT RELEASE THIS MAP
Your builds are like nothing else. Insanely cool. I would definitely pay to play on this map. Imagine how epic it would be if your USW turned into a massive server like Hypixel Skyblock…
All i can say , this guy is freaking genius and creative!
Hey can you add coustom loot tables
You're just THE BEST RLY!!! Everyone should Sub you :)
The last part is breathtaking view as if you're watching a dwarf kingdom movie
You're  really great at building things 😍😍😍
will the map be free download or patreon only?
PLEASE TELL ME THIS WILL BE AVALIBLE IN BETA! (idc If I have to pay but if so pls lemme know)
If I downloaded this map my phone would literally die
I have been following this series from the beginning, and I have never been so completely enthralled by a Minecraft series. Good job Trixy & Steph you guys are legends🤩😏
I would love to see you on hermitcraft. You would be an incredible addition to the the series
Imagine this guy's trainsforming the Nether in USW, damn my phone will be hella dead 💀
Seriously @TrixyBlox.   Both your efforts should be made into minecraft. The lore is so interesting and I really enjoy the finer details put into the cities etc.   Cannot wait to explore this map
It's really great and awesome at the same time, You deserve more subscribers than you already have, I love your builds <3
Actually, minecraft has a lot more biomes
i have a great idea for a story here  the dwarfs united under one king that both represented the values of the amethyst and copper faction he was a very smarte engineur and a fearlessfighter  only under him the dwars truthly united. But unfortunetly he got cursed / or lotr style got brainwashed by the gold and turned into the warden. After you prove that you are both a great warrior and a smart inventor you cold fight the warden and after defeatinf him gaining a very powerfoul axe the symbol of a fighter and a crossbow a great powerfoul invention and maybey also a book with some great information or xp
imagine if orespawn was still a thing and was put into this map
O M G !!! This is so clean !! I tried myself to build something like this before, but my skills are too much low and I didn't suceed to do something that i was prood of... Now I saw it, I want to restart the project and see if by being inspired by your blocks combination, i can do better !  So thanks a lot for being that creative and skillfull, thanks to you, I found this desire to build again ! Can't wait for the release of the map..  :3
HELP!
The reinforced deep slate thing is just an elaborate among us troll
I couldn't handle the level of insanity of this build. Every episode literally gets better and this the best example of it. Hopefully you slow down for now coz I'm having a great headache from being mindblown by this build😂😂😂😂. Anyways, love your builds and always be supporting and hopefully I can play this map.
P
Skyrim Skyrim Skyrim Skyrim Skyrim Skyrim Skyrim Skyrim
How about the nether and the end
I hope Hermitcraft or any SMP will play on this map on their offseason... it can be called season #.5 or something, it would be cool if any will do
dudes making a whole movie
Will USW world be available for everyone to download when it’s done?
Everything about this and the world you've made is SERIOUSLY COOL!!! The lore, the layout of the builds, I just can't comprehend all the time and effort you took to make this possible. You deserve the praise you get!! Keep up the amazing work!!
Awesome
These are the only Minecraft videos I watch! Keep it up!👌🏼
Pls make this usw for free
Holy cow 🤯
Trixyblox..... I admire your work soo much bro
Its going to be a shame to play on this map with a 5x5 dirt hut
It will look op with shaders
Question  :  can we play in USW on minecraft version 1.16 ??
omfg imagine if Empires SMP season 2 is done using this map 🤯
i feel like this guy’s face changes every video
Is the world download free?
I Want Snowy Mountain Next
and seriously volcano, moon and sun and an alien planet🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😅😅😅😅😅🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
and maybe even void🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😙😂😂😂😂
transform nether and end too ( including an end city )
You have properly outdone yourself that is awesome
Video starts at 3:35
I've been loving this project since the beginning, but this build was so beautiful it almost brought me to tears. You and Steph are doing amazing work. I'm really looking forward to playing this map. Also, I'm hoping there will be a regular upgraded dungeon, not just the cool Warden cells.
SUGGESTION: maybe even add some mods/have someone add some
Imagine someone makes a mod for this world(which is having the people/mobs in through the bioms and places) i would've been cool
UK version of yeat (jokes)
You should take inspiration from the Himalayan Monasteries for the mountain biome, they would be perfect for incorporating lore and exploration to the mountain biome.
Is this included in the  patreon
I like it I'll sub you
This was beautiful, yet I feel like the Warden should've been able to take a few smol bois.
hè brings mega builds to an extreme level
Can't wait for the next episode. Amazing work keep it up 😃
Can bedrock join the game🤔🤔
If only mc looked like this by default! This looks gorgeous
Master peice
Do customs weapons
You are so good at this, this is so impresive, i love it !
Is this build available to download? Btw this is amazing work.
That was tooo much work ....
Trixy deserves more attention especially for this series, this is amazing and awesome!
OH SO COOL
Mans just made "separate but equal" in minecraft
It would be great yo have an ocean cities and a sky cities too
Hi What shaders do u use and will the USW be free? 😁
5:56 amog-
are there gonna be like normal caves like when you strip mining like is there generated ores everywhere
Hey trixy can you upload this world to mcped cause I can't do patron
you should add some pirate camps around rivers where there is some treasures and maybe even a treasure map
i love this project so SO much
imagine this man in hermitcraft
I love this series. It has inspired me to try my own hand at Minecraft worldbuilding
For your next steps after the map you should team up with some modders to make some custom mobs and bosses like the wolf and bone tribesman,  dwarves, cowboys/raiders, maybe mummies and maybe some custom armor and gear. That would set this to a whole new level
This is AMAZING!! ☺️🥰
Reminds me of the deep roads
is it a modded survial world? or just like a normal vanilla one
My favorite YouTube series in a long while. Every time I see a new edition uploaded I'm so quick to click
Yoh should build a giant arena for events to be held in the world
This is amazing, I think this might be my favorite build in Minecraft
Is this bedrock or Java?
When this comes out i have to play it. I have seen every video for this project, you are doing amazing work bro keep it up. Please contiune doing what you do.
Now that is what we call 1.19,why don't you put trap
This man has infinite possibilities, endless creativity and is just so smooth.  Absolutely insane.  You cannot compare this to anything.
Minecraft hire this mans
Can we expect to find this on bedrock edition?
for the tiga or the snowy mountains you should add the igloos with the little room under it but the little room is a under ground network connect to the village your gonna build there and the lore for it is when it gets to cold they go into the tunnels and found something horrible in a room so they sealed it off.
my favorite part of the vid was the forge
This is 100% my favorite upgrade so far! Great job!!
You need to do the nether
can you make the other islands. with people  that left the main island
When the island is done challenge  some youtubers to survive 100 in the island
to be honest i dont want the wardens to be in minecraft im already scared of the caves itself 😭💀
@Mojang you might need to upgrade the structure
This is getting more and more amazing
Bro, Imagine 1M players played and every 100 thousand of them represent different tribes, it would be insane
I would be really intrigued if you could hide a little Month Python reference... Still, these builds are fantastic, and probably among the best I've ever seen.
Insane and shoutout to your absolute gem of gf
You should make a greenhouse in the snowy mountains. It would look really nice to have greenery flourishing in the beautiful snowy landscape.
Your a legendary builder
What about a ocean biome around the map?
I can’t wait to see how the usw turns out to look like
Attack on titan underground city wall maria be like
Omg the last minutes Killed me 🙄 The Hole Video was it dark and theenn the White Background aaaaaaa my eys 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 But respect this project is amazing  :)
Please put a Shrek reference in the Swamp
As I see those glowing eyed statues I can only think one thing "Gotta killed for extra RUNES!!!"   I've been playing too much Elden Ring...           Nah nevermind, I havent even beat the game yet, therefore I clearly havent played it enough!
Imagine those hanging conveyors being functional through the Create mod... that would be pretty awesome, honestly!
Are you going to do something with the Nether?
please do the winter biome next
Jesus loves you-
Is this world going to have a custom nether/end?
This world is going to be insane to play in man
do the snowy mountains next
Transform the nether for that map :) if no end:| dragon area not endless end :)
Is it me or your island is looking kinda SUS ?
This is probably the coolest thing anyone has made in Minecraft
You would be perfect on hermitcraft, not just building, but creativity with lore.
Will there be npcs in the game? I dont know much about minecraft so i have no idea
This is so beyond fucking legit
I really want to play on this but sadly I cant get patreon :(
cant wait to play it and build a shitty dirt house in the planes biome and never touch the world again !!
Do the nether next pls
I'm so excited for this! :D
Do a hardcore world! Im interested :D
Just Insane!!! Awesome work
will the world be available on bedrock edition?
for the religious building in the taiga, you could do something inspired of Norse stave churchs, or the Pagan temple at Uppsala. You could also inspire of Northern European styles of houses, like in Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, northern Norway, or Svaalbard. You know the cute little colored houses
Hear me out it would be cool if maybe in the GIANT dwarf area they had a the main mining tunnel which led to one big and long ravine that consisted of multiple mineshafts which eventually one of the railroads led to an ancient kingdom (I think it should be somewhere in the plan biome, but also cool in the snowy mountains) where a king held the portal in his stronghold under his kingdom to enter THE END. I don't know if you already have an idea for stronghold, ravine, or mineshafts, but I think this would be pretty cool and maybe expand the storyline some.
When its released, will you make a lets play yourself?
this reminds me of those dwarven mines from Hypixel Skyblock
20:59 I think those are portals the wardens came from
You never fail to amaze me
Honestly I love it but it would be cool if you built a giant amethyst deposit
Dude you never fail to impress
I think this is my favorite area so far!!!! Gorgeous😍😍
wil thuis word be availeble for Minecraft bedrock when its done?
Could you put the build link please??
Will this map be available for people on minecraft bedrock, or is it just for Java players?
Your love and dedication to minecraft is why we love and are dedicated to watching you trixy
not pigeon piglin
U should do the nether with pigeon villages and upgraded buildings and stuff
What about the ocean?🤔
imagine this but you add mods and make it a modpack.... then make an smp out of it
Mental
This is lit
I can not wait for this to be released
A giant dwarf that sounds weird
I wish i could build like this! It's SOOOOOO well made ! LOVE IT
the content is jaw-dropping congratulations
Will the usw be available for bedrock?
In the snowy mountains literally just make russia 🇷🇺 (you know how cold it is there)
Can u get this map on bedrock like a mobile or PS4 because I don’t have a pc
This was absolutely insane
Jeracraft x Trixyblox???
why is this #survival it makes literally no sense
How much is the world gonna cost?
You should make a mod pack for custom mobs
I think the amethyst roofs tie in to the dwarfs being the oar focused faction were a good tutch , making everything skulk makes it seem as though the city doesn't belong to dwarfs but to a race of skulk people.
Wow this gives me Erebor vibes!! Very nice.
Can you make a small snow golem village in the mountains
Unbleavable!
Trixy Blox Can u Tell Me pls when we Can become the Seed pls
Trixyblox love this world. how can we play it again when it comes out? and how would you do Japan style Build both the outside and  the inside?
I better get my pop corn this is gonna be a good one
Please do not rush this. Take all the time in the world to finish this absolute beastly masterpiece. I cannot wait to play the story
would love to see Tibetan/Buddhist architecture featured in the mountain biome :)
Every time I see one of these videos, I want to play this map more and more!
wow
Bruh this dude needs to give me some world painter tutorials
Ssssssss
Why is this dude not recognized by Minecraft yet? He’s insane!😍
The epic-ness of U.S.W. is immeasurable
HEY TB PLS MAKE NETHER AND THE END I WANNA SEE UOW U MAKE DEM COLLOER AND BETTER
I seriously can't wait to play this map! It looks amazing!!!
congrats you made a sort of revamped skyrim in minecraft.
Omg this is SO amazing
With quest craft now a thing this would be amazing to implement to vr
Damn my pc is gonna crash from this world 😂
You are insane
I would suggest upgrading the surrounding oceans, new shipwrecks and ruins?
dude, you are one of the best level designers I have ever seen
HOW THE HECK DO YOU DO THIS
Please send a this  map in one of your video s
can there be a secret village hanging from the lush ceiling
You  should make a mod for this
How can I also get this map?  (On phone / Bedrock) This is awesome work!
Will there be other tools than just the basic Sword, shovel, pickaxe, axe etc.? like battle axes, long swords, special bows, daggers etc?
*это так красиво 😍*
Can't wait to play it!!!!!
Honestly what you've done for the Minecraft community is insane! Keep up the amazing work you're doing, can't wait until the U.S.W. is released!
This doesn't even look like minecraft now its so beautiful.
i need this map
This build would look AMAZING with the create mod. Please make a video with the mod.
Thanks Youtube for NOT notifying me...  I love this story so far! (and yes I did have the bell on)
You should get the midevil mod for war hammers and much more weapons.
you say the wild update is one of the best updates but if this is in real minecraft it was the best update ever
Staggering work, I’m so excited to try this
Just wow, I'm blown away.
אני אוהב בנים
You should add a huge kingdom on the snow biom
Imagine giving this man LEGO to play with
At the end you should to a bonus and add the crate mod and make door open and more.
You should work to Mojang and your ideas are awesome
it looks like fortnite
Can you make the world for bedrock edition
the more u build the more im having trouble picking a place to live in evary place u make is amazing
This cave looks rather "small" when compared to the extension of the world. Will the rest of the island's underground be available too? Sorry if you already explained it and I didn't notice.
"giving you guys mini bosses" YOU CALL A WARDEN A MINI BOSS???
I don’t know if you’re already planning to do this, but you should make coral reefs as well as mermaid civilisations! That would be so cool
When the usw is down can we downloaded it?
When the usw is down can u make a download Link
I love this Serie, will the Nether and the End be included to?
These updates are why I joined as an Emerald level supporter. All the snapshots so far are cool as hecc!
For the empty bookshelves you could change them to backwards looms, they look just like empty bookshelves 😀👍
you work at Mojang lol, amazing build
Eredor  de  Hodit
Holy shoot man, this is amazing! I have said this before, could you make an Ancient Nordic worship place in one of the colder biomes? Like, combine a Game of Thrones weirwood tree and some statues of Odin, Thor, and so on. For a village, harbors and longships are of course necessary.
Is there any way to get this world for free?
I am even a subscribed to you please give me the world plssss 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
bro can I play this world on mcpe  as I like your usw  a lot so can you please provide me the usw pls 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Bruh this is sick
you gotta get a developer to make this an actual game. the story is epic and you already have a world for it.
For your next building make a reference to fnaf if you want
I wonder what's Grian's reaction to it.
I think that when you are done with the map you should make or ask someone to make a mod for it
I think your better than Grian
I swear if theres no yeti in the snowy mountains.
U said secrets amogus sus
How do I get the world when it is done
EVERYTHING JUST LOOKS AMAZING
Is the Nether also possible to upgrade?
This has to be one of the best minecraft builds in the last ten years, if not the n. 1
I absolutely love this one! Although it would be cool to ad a big spyglass in the middle looking out to the light or an opening like in your Underground Kingdom. The spyglass requires copper, and amethyst, so it would be the connection of the two factions.  Overall amazing build though, I love what you've done with it!
You should make a arena for mountain and make a smp series there
Wait till the dwarf realised making gold weapons / tools are shit
If this pays off, I'm sure it'll be worth every penny!!  Greetings from Brazil❤️🇧🇷
Shaders shaders shaders shaders please
I'm waiting the USW as much as all the big games coming this year, as always you did an amazing job
A gorrila statue on entrance of jungle ruins
eternal city vibes
You are awesome!  😎😎😎
Do the stronghold nekst pls
Where i can download this for free;(
Just discovered your channel and your builds are AMAZING, completely MIND BLOWING, like this must take SOOO LONG like WOW
RIP To whoevers pcs cant handle so much ;(
Bro I love your vids but you really need to shorten the intro. It was 3 ½ mins long but other than that it was a great video. Keep up the good work
I wanted to know if the USW will be available for people that are not patreons or in other word will it be free for everyone
Such a great project
This world could literally be an isekai world where this continent is the last human stronghold against the demon lord
I was wondering is this map going to be available to public for free when its done or do i have to pay?
If I may make a suggestion, I think in the taiga biome or frost mountains should have elements of Celtic and Norse buildings respectively. Maybe a stand in Highland castle or perhaps a longhouse of the local Chieftain.
It is said that during mining the dwarves would have a anthem like song that  Tells the tale of the acient dwarves during its early times in the cave the song  Would be heard to the entire cave system Striking fear to those people who are trespassing and the song is also a way to see if a person is hiding inside as a dwarve cause only dwarves can sing the song it is said that during the repeated  song the spirits of the acient dwarves will be heard singing with its ancestors  I am a dwarf and im digging a hole  diggy diggy hole diggy hole
I have one question, do you intend to make a custom arena for fighting the Ender Dragon?
Bring back memory it been 1 year since I play Minecraft
This is a masterpiece , every time it gets infinitely better
Amaizing!
Freemium isn't free, you tricky block. Stop promoting micro-transactions to children. Dragon City isn't epic either. It's a bad game that makes tons of money from micro-transactions.
Is it just me but the cave looks like the temple thing in vox machina,  when they fought delilha
haha crossiont go brrrrrrrr
All of your USW videos are super epic, but this one is definitely my favourite. I can't wait to actually explore it!
Trixyblox can make a good build without shaders Change my mind
asian inspired builds pleaseeee
Why don't u try to see if u can get it on Minecraft Nintendo switch for
i find ur voice very calming and i always try and watch these at night. i swear it takes me 5 tries to finish one vid bc i fall asleep every time LMAO
When you mentioned the forge i immediately imagined quests where you can make your own weapons based on what kind of materials you've gathered throughout the journey there, perhaps like making special amethyst gems or different sorts of copper that can give different abilities when applied to weapons and such? that are like the enchanting books of the underground or just making cool weapons with even cooler abilities that you can only create in the underground with specific elements from your journey before you come here if that makes any sense. I honestly can't wait till this is all finished if it hasn't blown me away now It definitely will once everything is set and done
Man why dont u make new models for the mobs, u can get a mod maker he might help and make the tools of the caves, here is a mod maker, https://youtube.com/c/SkylorBeck ,and 3d modeler, https://youtube.com/c/DanielKrafft
Can you build a Castle on the top of the Snow mountain?
hectic
i wish i could download this without money
Fucking sick🤯
Can I play in bedrock
Dude will be done in 2025
Amazing work. Really loving how this is turning into a more and more interesting story. And as always, amazing builds.
This whole series is so incredible!
r u gonna transform the nether tho? (also very cool cave :)
YOUR INSANE!!!!
Yo trixy got a suggestion, a small nether corruption zone where he'll it's self has leaked through a great portal made by a lost civilization.
I cannot wait for it to come out 🥺
If this whole ultimate survival world finished, Mojang should Collab with trixyblox and other Minecraft creators on YouTube especially the biggest of them and make a 50 minutes - 1 hour fantasy vid about this lands story. If this happens it will be epic
I am a dwarf and I dig diggy hole
Imagine Trixy on Hermitcraft lol
This reminds me so much of God of War
Really hoping for a bloodbourne like city in the winter biology, frozen over decrepit crypts. Can’t wait to see more
how has this man not been hired by the Minecraft builder team yet
The moment this world is done, I can already tell how many Minecraft players would play this world
Do you plan to transform the Wind or the nether i think it can be cool
Bro wash your hair
Did you rename the video?
Trixy showing raw iron pouring into forge. Person like me: "Oh yes! This looks good but it will look good even in my inventory".
I can't wait to play this its so cool
UwU
Please please upgrade fortress and a in water city also make the cave little bit more bigger
This is fantastic. With every build you amaze me more and more. I cant get over the beauty of this, you should really work on video game level design. People like you could make the most gorgious games in the industry.
Could have called the founders smelting are a foundry
I'm currently building a large D&D inspired world I created, all thanks to you and your creativity. Your builds are something I look to when I'm getting "builder's block", thank you for the inspiration and the time you've taken to make this for all of us.
I wish you will make a greeks in mountains but i think its not possible.;__;
This is amazing. Just imagine if sebody makes a mod to fot in this amazing worlds, with all the races and side quests and such stuff. That'd be so cool.
timy to prep my popcorn..
MINECRAFT SHOULD COPY THIS ANCIENT CITY AND MAKE IT JUST LIKE UR BUILD SO NICE
I love the idea, but won’t the wardens dig underground? They won’t stay in their cages I don’t think
what wouldve been cool is if one of the tribes in the cave system (dwarves, jungle king, pharoah, wolf tribe, etc.) betrayed them and their statue’s head was broken off and on the floor
To play
When is it gonna available
Will you be upgrading the water biomes?
Not to discourage but the Pharoah sratue would've been better for the giving lava to the forge because of the sun God ra
Can't wait to loot all the valuable blocks and steal from everyone
Pure masochism
Ugh I have too much lore to learn in my lifetime
Your builds are   ultimate  A lot love from India❤️❤️❤️🤩🤩🤩
"separate but equal" - I *really* prefer "two sides of the same coin"
I think you have mastered your craft man!! No one else is even close to you in these builds, you have so much detail, lore, research, and scale in every single one of your builds and what you do is truly mindblowing. KEEP UP THE HARD WORK you are insanely talented!
How will I be able to doenload/play this
I don’t think there is a word beyond epic to describe what you do, you are incredibly dedicated
Is it gonna be on ps4?
I love it
Incredible colour palate!
I have a really good idea for the cave, just the amethyst side the copper faction should have a copper belt and under the stone shell,the ores (Copper and Amethyst) will cover it of course the  amethyst and copper will half the cave.i really hope that you would impliment these changes.
I don't care what anyone says, the talent this guy has is remarkable.
🔥
Ngl if you add the sea lanterns on the bottom layer of water. That will add some lively touch
i wonder what hardcore would look like in usw..
do you plan on doing the nether and end because you could connect portals to the dwarve faction of fighting to bastions in the nether and find a way to connect the other faction to the nether fortress. and a cooler end battle to incorporate the whole story of it being the ultimate survival world
AAMMMMMMMMAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZINNNNNNNNNNGG!! I always look forward to all your videos, they are so creative and incredible! I can't wait for this map to be out, I haven't watched the Steph blocks videos yet bc I don't want any spoilers for when I play! I would have to say my favorite part was seeing the molten gold being poured from bucket to bucket. Idk why but when I see anything that resembles molten metals in MC it just UGH it hits the spot for me lol. Can't wait for the next update!!
dude this is sO PRETTY
Nice, will it be able to play in mobile with no problem?🤨🤨
I wish these worlds were available on Bedrock Edition lol
Your building skills are insane
Trixy's ability to make all these amazing things on 1:1 scale is already incredible, but the lore and precision with it all makes it SO enticing. He's not just making a good looking map, he's making a world with a whole intricate story behind it and I really appreciate it
I admire you both so much for putting so much effort into a amazing world. I do have a question though. Will this mod be available on bedrock edition?
Trixy. I want to download and play this... But i dont know how..
Imagine tweaking this build with the create mod to make the gold and smelting functional. That would be so wild.
So the dwarfs have all this gold and only use it for tools???
How is this survival?
Ravens in captivity can learn to talk better than parrots.
the scale of what you're doing is truly breathtaking. I cannot wait for the final product (if there ever truly is one) and thank you for all you've done!
are you gonna do buildings in the nether or customize some of the builds you find in the nether?
Insane
You truly are amazing! The amount of effort and time you put into these builds are unreal! Most people would give up by the 40 minute mark! You truly are amazing and definitely deserve more subscribers than you already have! I personally wish I had the Motivation and skills you have, I really can not wait to play! I also hope people will do let’s plays and bring more attention to your work! I really hope you blow up (as in your Chanel subs not literally) I hope you have a nice day / night !
Video starts at 3:34
Great build! I’ve been watching you for a while now and I think it would be really cool if you joined a server like hermit craft
Vanilla is Not Good Enough.
These are beautiful! The dwarf statue fades into the background s little tho
This will be a Survival-World? How?   Downloadable Map? How?   I dont really understand it. How can Survival even bring you through such a giant Space? Wont you  be at the Peak (Netherite Armor+Elytry) before you even explored 1 full Biome??
Is it going to cost anything to play this map once it’s done?
you should do an ocean faction I think it would look AWESOME
That was incredible. You are doing so well, man!
How do you skan the q are code
bedrock?
Your still at it
https://youtu.be/qQXdJsHhhzw
I love that there's an actual lore about it, sounds really interesting.
this is looking great so far! but are you going to tackle the nether and end? if not then i still think this will be a great project
You should join hermitcraft! They just started a new season and their all great builders and i think you would enjoy it
I can’t wait to get my hands on this map. I plan to make my own changes to it as to “creatify” it. Basically I’m going to take advantage of everything that could work in create mod like doors, trains, etc.
i cant wait to play this with my new 3070 and shaders
idk how but its keeps getting better
Great builds but where the portal
Dont forget to add the society's military force or some kind of recruit/soldier training area. that would be a very good addition
I would love to play in that but, my pc wouldn’t even be able to handle me clicking on the world
Make it for le and free so all  can see you hard work when it is completed
im so glad you have  over 1 million sub you deserve it
bro playing survive will be so easy to get resources i mean he builds stuff with gold and diamonds 😂😂
Whoa this is amazing <3
Drums Drums in the deep
I am physically unable to express how much in love I am with your creations. This isn't only gonna be the most beautiful world but it's also just a peace of art! Hat of for that dedication man. Just pure shock over that beauty
I hope this will be available on bedrock edition
what is the name of the structure pack with the glowing ores i love it
This is definetly my favorite world
the glow plants would be great for a lotr style elves build
It’s a man’s world
Question,  will this map fially be free to download,  i would love to pay but live in a 3rd world country with no online payment methods available,  i wish i could but i can't,  so would i be able to enjoy the map for free?, and love the build
I have a huge idea. You should try to contact a mod maker and ask them to create a modpack that tied with this map
You have the best details that I have ever seen
This video reminded me of Troll Hunters Tails of Arcadia! Supper Cool
can u do a tutorial i wanna rebuild
This is so above and beyond expectations, which is what I think almost every time you upload. Simply amazing ❤️
This has to be my favourite one but I’m a little disappointed that you scraped the amethyst houses that being said I would love to see some of the houses of the copper faction to be made of copper
Could you have a sea queen or king ? Also could the kingdom look like what we think Atlantis looks like ?
2 words: HOLY S**T
Hi, will you do a kind of angel tribe city ? I mean a tribe in the sky (like a greec Olympia style or something?)
Will you be adding npcs?
I cant wait to get this
You should try to put this as a survival map on bedrock if possible
The USW should be a server for all online players to play with custom mobs and items with NPCs. Also, when you start the world you have to pick a race... Nvm I'm just describing D&D
will you keep on building this if the like count isn't 250,000?
Great job this world looks sick and I can't wait to play it. One complaint tho. The dwarf statue is not in the center and the laba is not on the center and thats annoying. Everything else is fine. No super awesome
This is definitely my favorite upgrade so far!
dude I've been waiting for specifically the two remaining biomes and now they're not just last, theres stuff inbetween too wth
this is really secksi
I still can't unsee the island looking like an among us.
What about the nether?
Si beautifull
great video bud
I wish I could have seen Minecraft like this when I started playing. It would be amazing if this was added as a map to the main game...
I think you should hire someone or download a mod for A.I like goblins,dwarfs etc
If you wanna skip the advertisement for dragon city, go to 3:36
I've been following this for a while on another acc and I feel like dark oak needs something else, I would love to see a massive canyon_like build in it! I love this series
Add NPCs
Why does the island look like the fortnite chapter 3 island lol this guy predicted the new island
Once again, this is INSANE!! You didn an amazing job! I love this series
This guy has so much time in his hands, he's probably sold his soul to the devil and killed him for the contract to not backfire.
Yes, Dragon City is F2P. Just like all the games advertise. Of course, there aren't really any good F2P games. In fact, Minecraft might just be the most F2P of them all. Java edition, at least.
I want to explor that shit so bad in mc vr when its finished
Ever going to tweak the end dimension
I'm getting strong Lord of the Rings vibes
I wonder if he will do anything with the nether and the end
Were do we spawn
hey I loved the amethyst-designed rooftops, you have to include them somewhere, they were beautiful
Btw I feel like it’s stupid for a game to waste there money to get sponsored in a video because as soon as someone hears “today’s sponsor is… “. The person will immediately skip the part of the video with the sponsor.
So good man you deserve so much for the hard work u put in, cant wait for more
at the time that i sent this chat, i havent seen all the video, but my jaw just continues to drop, i wish i had money to donate, this world is deserving of thousands of dollars.
I really liked the the amethyst roofs on the buildings I thought it was different but still fit the theme of the city.
My mind has been BLOOOOOOWN !!!!! Good stuff mate !
Is it available to download now?
man i wish i could like the video like 500 times, your work is amazing
damn, this is amazing, keep up the other worldly work 👍👍
i love your stuff, i cant wait to play this one
Are you gonna redo / do a mangrove swamp biome
Do you plan on upgrading the swamp when the wild update comes out as well?
this would be a great map for faction/kingdom servers
MOOORRREEEEEEE
Is there any date or timeframes when we can expect this whole project to release or are you taking it more on a rolling basis and not setting a hard release date? Either way phenomenal work.
We REALLY need to address the continuous racism and racial stereotypes used in this series, Trixy. We know you don't mean any harm by it, but using indigenous caricatures and putting a very stereotypical war bonnet on your Native American inspired statue is just... not a good look. Please, PLEASE reevaluate what you're doing and do more research into the cultures you're using as inspiration, and maybe don't use some of them at all. Please talk to actual people from said cultures as well before deciding to use their culture in such an appropriated way.
Omg this is the greatest build I have ever seen in minecraft
I am a dwarf and I am digging a hole
If only I had Java I would instantly get this, of course only after getting tear down
Can you add it on tribe based on a tribe that lives in the polls that can eat a purely meat based diet and survive for at least a month off of only animals and no vegetables or fruit. For the Tiga of course
please please put this map for purchase in bedrock!!!!
Minecrafts reinforced deepslate thing: Amongus meme. How trixybolx will upgrade it: Giant Minecraft Creeper.
This dude can't grow a beard 🤣🤣🤣🤣
please tell me you will add sculk blocks like shriekers and catalysts to the USW when it come out
Amazing stuff so far! PLEASE also do your own version of the end for a epic boss battle against the ender dragon to finish off your version of a vanilla survival world!
the video starts 3 and a half mins into the video lol
Wow!
Origins mod plus this map would be insane!
Maybe a big nether portal in the elder dwelling area so they could actually get the warped wood and soul sand for the soul fire
Awsome
For the two next biomes, it would be cool if the rulers were women, similar to this episode’s founding fathers. :)
I am the coppre faction
Someone better make a massive server out of this
Are you going to transform the seafloor, ruins and ocean monuments?
dude imagine they added these structures to minecraft. The game would reach a whole new level of awesomeness
There should be a usw book, ik steph has a channel talking about usw, but a book would be cool too
Are you in Java or bedrock
Can you please let me into one of your videos so I can rickroll your whole fanbase?
Could you make Custom villiger trades
Can You get the WORLD download free
The caves are truly extraordinary, that's for sure. But can we just talk about the amazing episode soundtrack?? It seriously gave me chills!
This guy is crazy, thats very cool
wow i can't even express how insanely cool everything in this vixeo is💜🖤
I can’t wait till the next ep.! TrixyBlox is an amazing Builder.
When upgrading the mountains region you should create a race similar to white walkers from game of thrones. I think that would spice up the world even more. Love the videos!
what is the seedd please
it kinda looks like erebor from LOTR
Will the be the end
Again please release this for bedrock
Wait… WHHHHHAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HOW COOL IS THIS??????????????????
😨
how you make the roof of this cave
mountain biomie please
one of the things i think would be mid blowing to the hitory of the USW would e something i saw on this video: https://youtu.be/gjGBP0E4zEs basicly, i think it would be very cool if trixyblox did something like various underground ancient citys that were there before or to go and make a new city that would be on one of the biomes with something like this, or even better, make so those acient cities were under this cave of the dwarfes, there are various possibilities to go and do something based on the video i show. Continue to make amazing videos like these. :) P.S:  @TrixyBlox if you do think of my idea as being interesting and you think on using it on some future video of the USW, then i would like if you could pin my comment an give it a heart :) P.S(2): sorry for bad english i'm brasilian
Trixy if you have 1percent of your viewers subscribed and you so that means you got roughly the 200m views
As much as I love this, I wish I didn't know about this so I could fully discover it later on. It's just so freakin' good!
imagine how many players this guy had to hire as by standing dwarfs in the showcase
Are you going to do the nether?
Hey could you make a HUGE really realistic and cool ender dragon build? You’re such a good builder and you could do it really well!
Question: Can you draw? Because the way you build those statues indicates that you have some knowledge of human anatomy.
This is amazing, you did a great job on this one and on all of them, i just can't wait to see how the rest of the buildings go
Idk if there are any lotr fans out here, but that reminds me of the Mines Of Moria
Wich texture pack have you??
every update after 1.12.2 is shit
@TrixyBlox Do you mind making a couple of videos showing us your detailed process? Stuff like copying, mirroring, and world painter trix. I am interested in making complex builds, but can't find any videos that help. It would be really appreciated.
Hello, I'm from Russia. I love your videos about building in minecraft.
You should put a super powerful sword in the center of the forge for when you release it.
I can't wait to see the Taiga and Snow mountain builds. I've followed this series religiously Awesome creation Trixy
3:35 video starts
If you made Minecraft structures Minecraft would be better
Amazing man!! Can’t wait to play thing
Will this be playable on bedrock?
The only thing that worries me about these builds is that they are so big it might become... lonely Like the only other player-like mobs in the game are the Villagers, and they don't really fit in the dwarf narrative that it's being created in this case My question is if you're gonna use some type of mod to add some type of npc, or are you just gonna leave these huge constructions empty?
you should make a world for the hermitcraft
Bro this world looks epic, but you're milking it dry, you get less and less likes each time, people are getting inpatient, be careful, you got my sub tho
i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When it will be Public broooooo
Ide
I think there is a secret weapon or tool, and I don't want to know how strong it would be😂
do not forget the nether and the end
This is already looking better than the premature release of Cyberpunk 2077. This is supposed to be a huge compliment, since the game costed 60€ and was a major letdown upon its release.
Trixy holy good god oh my gosh. I don't even have an exclamatory phrase powerful enough to express the awe I am left with after seeing this build. This is my favorite build I have ever seen you do. The statues at the beginning in the forge are possibly the coolest and most beautiful things I've seen made in Minecraft. So well done. I won't ramble on any more... but this is amazing.
You should make a mod adding new items for the USW
4 minute intro 😢😱
After You can survives in the world
Imagine if Mojang hired this guy for the 1.20 update -  Lore: 10/10 Exploration Factor: 10/10 Builds: 100/10 Playability 10/10
This is increasingly looking like something I won't be able to afford when the time comes. LOL. But I do like window-shopping it.
I'm just waiting for him to do the end!
This is so cool! Will it be multiplayer compatible?
Are you gonna do anything with the nether?
Damn
This would look sick if there was blue lava
This is a whole battle royale with a storyline
theres one question: how long would it take to travel the 16 million block map. ive seen a youtuber walk 1 million blocks as 1 million special and it took hours.
Does any one know how we can get this on console
For the boats you should make some similar to Viking lobgboats
Maybe you do the theme of the snowy mountains that there was a big war betheen the people there and another tribe and that most of the people died and almost everything is broken and damaged. Hope you like it!
Are you going to modify Nether and The End,because that would mean a lot to the USW.
Make the snowy mountains like isolated people that are very advanced and have a fort on the mountain please
Will villager's skins be themed for each biome? For example having dwarfs in the caves instead of having vanilla villagers. This would be a great addition!
imagine using create mod to make some blocks move circularly in this world
Few questions… first though AMAZING!!! 2nd how are you getting the videos?? Like how are you recording a video while you are working on the stuff? Also how are you taking a build from one spot and moving it to another?
i mentally can not comprehend how much time this would take to make and play for example me and my friend were traveling to a woodland mansion we started off going the wrong way on our map for 3000 blocks and then finally got there after another 3000 blocks and in total to travel 6000 blocks it took us an hour or so but this is 16,000,000 BLOCKS?!?!??
Can we all agree that he is and will always be the best builder. He spends so much time to build these.
Quick suggestion, the Warden may get an ability based on digging underground, as I believe there was a tweet that stated that the Warden would get a counter to pillaring, so you may want to add some kind of datapack that stops them from exiting their respective dungeons. Or they could escape and wreak havoc, and that could be fun as well.
The Dwarves need some semblance of self-sustainability.   A farm for Mushrooms and Glowberries would be good, as well as even some Mooshrooms.  With the light sources they have or should have access to; Lava, Glow Lichen, Glow Squids, Glowstone, Shroomlight, and Soul Lanterns/Campfires, it would be enough to probably grow mushrooms.  The Glowberries are natural to the caves, the Mushrooms were traded via the Jungle Kingdom and the Cows from the Mesa. The mushrooms took easily down in the caves and became a ready supply of food both for the Dwarves and Cows, which slowly became Mooshrooms over time. They could then either be milked for Mushroom Stew or slaughtered for Beef. Other foods were more of a luxury, since they didn't keep well in the damp underground.
This has to be my favourite upgrade so far. The sheer amount of detail that has been put into this is amazing. Also, It reminds me of the How to Train Your Dragon franchise which I've always been a huge fan of. Great Job on this one I love it!
Idea: Maybe add a huge landmark smack dabb in the middle of the world, I was thinking like a tree or something. Maybe every civilization has a history to the landmark? Idk just an idea 🤷‍♀️
With the height of the world being increased it would be amazing to have a sky city !
My favorite part so far.
Your PC can survive huge builds with shaders can you tell me about your PC
You're sooo good bro
Wtf
Will it be possible to download this for free when it comes out?
This world would be incredible for non cringe role play
I do wonder if hes going to use regular villagers or some kind of npcs to inhabit all of the cities! I admit it will seem kind of lonely if its only you and friends in the world
Nice dungeon. One small issue. Wardens can burrow underground.
Imagine if you did this in survival
That was amazing! Could you maybe make an air city for when you have got an elytra!! Can't wait for the next part!!!
Ma Boi Here Used MakeUp To Look Fantastic For His Fans Respect
look like lord of the rings
Kerennn
I wish I could do this
The Taiga biome in Minecraft has an igloo with a mysterious dungeon with the ingredients to reverse a zombie villager. So maybe in the Taiga biome there can be an alchemist isolated from the village.
Question: after you finish USW and after many years of update and the adding of new biomes will you upgrade the USW or looking at the world generation will  you make a new continent
Will we be able to download this map?
collectable banners are such a cool idea!! it's like explorer achievements
Bro I just came
This is epic!
how are you not in hermitcraft
is the nether getting an upgrade aswell?
so cool !
If i may make a suggestion you could use stained glass to make a void/bottom less pit
I SEE AMONG US
Each video is getting better and better can’t wait for the final product
Are you going to do Nether and end in this???
I really want to download your builds in my world
more more more more more!!!
Epic
Your so underrated
This will be my FAVORITE place when the world comes out
arent you scared that players ar gonne make everything broken
are the nether and the end going to get an update aswell?
This stuff you made will probably become a base building element and recipe copied by many custom map,quest and server builders this is litterally esatabilising a new foundation for minecraft community and fandom
It would be soo cool if trixy were to work with mojang. Imagine him being responsible for the designs and overall world look, and that implemented into a working world gen system.. Anyways love your vids, and that you only gain more and more attention. ❤
are you planning on doing the nether and End as well?
Will you add mods to make a better experience
“To add a little ambience, I created some simple lighting arrangements” *creates a mind shatteringly complex structural lighting system the likes of which the world has never seen
Your builds are absolutely incredible! I wish I were able to access this world myself! Amazing job, as always.
AMAZING VIDEO!!! Please cut the intro shorter though, 4 minutes just to get into some gameplay seems just a little too long. Will say i do appreciate the background info, i just like to see more gameplay personally! Keep up the amazing building!!!
I hope I have my pc before this is released I really want to play it 😁
Is this the 1.20 minecraft update?
Hey, I love your builds you are the world edit king.  I was wondering if and how to get this map on XBOX once you are done.  Thank you !
It is milking the series but can you be so mad at someone who built something like this?
Trixy making build eps for like months us waits for months just to get the U.S.E map break and the hard work
are you going to do the nether?
Trixyblox: let's start off with some basic dripstone stalagmites... Me: he's already done better than i ever have 😯
thats awesome
This is insane!! The quality of ur videos is sooo sick
Dude you can build a whole map with minimum rest but I can't even build 2 houses in under 3 hours
Anybody else wants Mojang to hire Trixy as their official game-momenuments/villages/whateverhugebuilding designer?
im going to have to get my friend to explore this with me
Can this be played on bedrock
amazing work am in love with it .  io wonder how big the world dowload would be.
I could never do this
you should code ai players into these builds unless you already have
Imagine a mod pack for this map, for example: goblins, Ogres and so on. How cool would that be. Anyways, I love the video. Your skill is really epic. You really should try to enter a build competition maybe and see if you can win. Good luck with future builds! :D
is there a world download?
The problem with this is that you don't want to break anything because it so pretty
Can android use this?
Watching this just blows my mind
I really love the caves and cliffs update, but I feel like we need more cave biomes!! The deep dark will certainly be a great addition, but ice caves, maga caverns, answers fungus infested caves would add that little extra, you could have some cold mobs, some hot mobs, and some familiar infested mobs, let's hope Mojang keeps expanding the caves
Youtube videos that make me wish I lived inside Minecraft (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*.✧
Guys, fyi im a massive dragon city fan as well as minecraft player, the link applies for existing accounts too! Just got the stuff lol. Edit: Though iv'e progressed far in the game i can tell the dragon will be relatively OP for new beginners.
When can we play this
I hope this be public server not a privat so we can sosialce each other
Ihave a question will you remake end and nether?
Can someone tell me what shaderpack he is using in his videos?
its godlike
You should definitely consider improving the nether, and maybe even the end.
Do the snowy mountains You can make a yeti and it’s hideout Mysterious ice cubes of frozen survivors A giant castle like the one in Frozen
Is it Minecraft?..
Mineshafts and Strongholds be like : 😐☕
That's looks cool if you put that four kings in evry corner of the cave and build something special loot or something in the middle.. But still looks awesome tho..
Pretty sus.. ............................... .  ............................................................................................................................................................................like imposter
Crazy
absolutely epic!
This was three days ago Ok
Who satisfying it is😌
Even if you give me 100 players I can only imagine to make some thing like this.
Sick build my man
Hey just a thought u could make the npc’s give you quests
You should really do a collab with Jeracraft, I think you two would really work together well.
Our account is so underraited
Ur should work for minecraft this is amazing, ur deserve more subs , I subscribed too
Thank you for entertaining me .  I know that it takes you so long to make these videos and editing so thank you
add a mod to it
Make a frog king
Add custom mobs
what about the stronghold or the nether?
i seriously cant wait to play this map.
Can you play this on bedrock and pocket edition
Someone needs to stop this man, with his powers, He's Making Minecraft To realistic His powers Are So Powerful, He's To Good!
This is okey dokey
lol it's more complicated then the trignometry question in my book!!
This nice  survival word
" Diggy Diggy Hole, Diggy Diggy HOLE "
Surely the first one to comment
TrixyBlox, r u gonna do the nether and end?
It's beautiful man !
How about the celestial TIAMUT from Eternals 🤔
im absolutely amazed... so much talent and imagination... you my man, arent a builder, you are an artist
cool potatoes
Imagine this in VR
It looks like Bionicle
Totally not like skyblock lol
lotr vibes
This, again, is incredible. I love how you always approach your builds from a practical and aesthetic point.
:)
How is this man not on hermitcraft
I SEE THE PAIN IN YOUR EYES!, but actually this is terrifyingly cool!
Will this world be adventure mode friendly? Because I don’t want to mine anything when it’s done.
This could make a really good modded server where you can choose what race or faction you want to be for surviving
Alright, someone HAS to make a roleplay series on this map
U mised fish in the water 😁😁😁😁🐟🐟🐟🐟🐠🐠🐡🐡🦈
I like the shaders
amazing i feel like back to Erebor
You should use create mod to add some unique features
how-? the statues look so cool the the dwarf housing look so cool
THIS IS MASSIVE
Yeah... It's kinda, rather sad u didn't add the end portal...
I saw musu
I can't stop feeling that this is overdone, I think that a survival world should be rather simple and its details much smaller in scale. The player is going to feel more like a spectator rather than a player in these enormous places and I don't think that it's what survival Minecraft is about...
Love this project, but that hat and hair reminds me of Home Alone. :)
And Put A Swamp
Make More Islands Pls
Id really love to add a few modpacks to the game especially the waystone mod since you need to travel that much
Are ther going to be a nether biome? Love your work
simply breathtaking
Are ther going to be a nether biome love your work
now the only underground structure missing is the stronghold, great video
Hi Trixy! I love all your builds and have been watching for ages. you've really outdone yourself with this build! Just wondering will you be putting this in the minecraft store on console (xbox and ps4&ps5 ) ?
yall wondering how did he capture the scenes? lol me too
what’s the seed
I would suggest not putting sculk sensors for the roofs because when one goes off they all will and it will be an incredible annoying sound in survival.
Hmmm I know it wasn't your intention, and you've done your best to bring diversity to this world but uh. Bro. It might be helpful to look at your group of statues and put aside the context of the backstory and look at who is standing tall and proud and who is kneeling. 😬 Im not gonna lecture you or anything but the optics are kinda not great.
Him: this dark city is not finished yet (Me who is struggling in making a normal house): *yes*
Will this be available in pocket edition
Sugestión: A Dragon mountain, like in the hobbit, maybe, could be great, without a Dragon inside, just the mountain being alusive to the Dragon/s. Or maybe a City in the clouds, like skypea, or a floating Town or castle. I think that wathever you do, It just become a great and EPIC part of this USW.
Are the dwarfs gonna be NPCs?
Will this be available for exbox
Hypixel needs to hire this man
Truly gifted I’ve never seen something like this look so good
This might be the greatest minecraft creation ever
playing this map with shaders and vr will be cool
where end city dungeon?
where nether dungeon?
Cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Will this be a pc only ?
I still think you should make a giant ghast nest in the nether
Okay nah dis fake    HOW IT SO GOOD
This kind of reminds me of the book “City Of Ember”
Loved these videos and they are simply incredible on how you are able to do this but is this going to be released on Xbox or just PC
I am going to start a warden uprising and destroy the dwarves I am but a little gremlin
This looks like something out of ‘Lord of the Rings’
I like your content keep the good work😊
Wow holy sh*t man... Absolutely killing it with each video! I'm getting merch
OMG!!! You really dodge this man, big congrats!
hopefully someone makes a mod that ties in with USW. it would be sick if there are bosses, smart npc and interactable blocks.
Dope
The agnosticism of sanctimoniousness is nearly independent in its omniscience.
I got troll hunters vibe.
Hey TinyBox, i have 2 questions:  when the map is finished, do you plan to release it to everyone or you will be paid?  And mods will be compatible with your map? It would be very interesting to put mods like Ice and fire and make a sever, it would be even lighter because you wouldn't need to put them in biomes or dungeons
Awesome story building! It reminds me a lot of the Dwemer in Elder Scrolls
how i wish game companies incorporate this type of story telling in creating the actual game...
GAH DAMN. beautiful details and the fog behind the statues in the end clip was sooo good!
Btw this bedrock edition, right?
whats the ip?
This man’s dedication is insane! I would quit halfway through, that is, if I could build so well!
For the snowy mountains you should make a Buddhist Tibet village
I get blown away even more with every new video bro. You’re an INCREDIBLE builder!!
Dude. You’re so freaking creative like how do you come up with these things! And the amount of motivation you have and how fast you get these things done is insane! Bravo 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I have a plan in the snow biome by putting a giant stone statue that protect a giant city that have a lot of treasure
TrixyBlox was actually building a "Deep Dark Kingdom" instead of Deep Dark City.
is there a way to preorder this world. cuz i know i want the finished product
The only thing all players will do after this USW is done is: Breaking the design for materials
So your telling us, that if the video doesn't reach the Like goal, you won't make another video??
You are one of the best Builders in Minecraft😱😱
I really can't stress enough how excited I am for this. I WANT TO LIVE IN THAT WORLD
I can't believe we play the same game tbh.
That would be so cool if there were cave citys
This is absolutely beautiful.
no way i just watched this video for free
Dude you're insane, tremendous work, so great 😃 👍
Please make it on the Minecraft store for free because I'm on PS4 and won't be able to get it like the comment if you agree with me
The forge is probably borrowed from the MCU. The ones who made weapons for Asgard. Exact same thing shown when Thor made stormbreaker.
Any chance to get this on Xbox or mobile
Last episode?!
Dude this thing keeps getting more insane and spectacular. Amazing job you madlad
After this entire project do middle earth. Then Westeros and Essos all 1:1 scale or close to. You'll have content for years.
I've always wanted to do something big like this in Minecraft, but it would take me decades because I play bedrock edition and don't have access to world edit
Great video as always Breathtaking building Overall pretty poggers Buut... My singing monsters>dragon vale>dragon city
Can you please add a Hindu Temple in one of the biomes
Looking forward to it being completed,  totally gonna check it out
Wait did he say the warden is a “mini” boss. That thing 3 shots maxed out netherite armor. I am scared of what a the actual boss is in the USW
Bravo! This was beautiful!!!  It is definitely my favorite so far, I can't wait until the whole map is out!
19:33 "So lets take a look at the caves"  *Mac and cheese ad summons*
Every video I think when I start the world I'm going straight there happens every time XD
Sup
You should make a meme worshipping zone inside of a big hill with lava and stuff
Soo whats the server ip
like the whole USW not just the caves
you think he would ask to add this to the console minecraft store? I'm willing to bet that Microsoft or Mojang would consider this massive world to be added to the store is Trixie offered, and it would make some extra cash along the side with the proper deal.
wow, i always quit creative mode after placing 2 blocks, are you even human?
Woah holy shit
They should put this your work an made masterpiece in New update can do a demand a mine in the caves
An idea I had, for the snowy mountains, perhaps make a large cavern with a village carved into the stone with lava rivers to keep the occupants warm and sheltered from the harsh environment outside
How do you do this in Xbox I take much longer on survival I thijnk
Unsubbed, don’t ask for subscribers :)
I'm a little concerned about the new warden features ruining this build.
I love seeing you build up this world, I can't wait to see it in full!
Oh, this will be so cool when its released! :DD
There need to be a Giant Hammer  in between the wolf tribe and the pharaoh and also amassing, absolutely beautiful stuff.
Why is he wearing lipstick
u should make your vids of the USW a bit longer , id like to see a longer version of your work
You shoyld have a modlink with the map so you can use special mods while using the map
I hope this map was actually a map on action RPG Game
"Its a fucking masterpiece."   -mossbag
Imagine all the mechanics that can be made in this map with the Create Mod. Oh the possibilities are endless! Amazing so far and I can't wait for the finished product.
It would be cool to see a Herobrine statue somewhere and a civilization worshipping him.
Snow moutains  next please
this isn’t just building in minecraft, this is making art. you are truly talented and i’m in awe of your work, it’s flawless
Make this into a server
Why hasn't mine craft hired him yet???
What about the jungles
Mojang should hire you
Bro it’s so amazing how you can make something so terrifying and yet so beautiful at the same time keep up the work a true masterpiece that’s what this world is so proud of you bro keep it going
every time I see there's a new video here I get SO EXCITED because I KNOW it's gonna be amazing :D and I get pleasantly surprised every time, you always exceed my expectations :3
what about the nether??"
Your creativity is amazing 😁😮
this is INSANE 🔥
It’s crazy how he does everything alone imagine if he had a team working with him this world would be 10x greater then it is but I still thinking having a Japanese themed place would be amazing IMO
Oh god, this is amazing!
Understanding that these builds are all done vanilla, it would be awesome to see a build incorporating the Create mod to have some of those massive gears spinning as well as other moving objects in the world.
Deep Dark cities aren't even released yet and there is already a better version
Hear me out custom nether and end
I'm one of the 60% non subscribed lol
i feel like this isnt coming out till 2024 lol
Imagine someone taking this world download when its done and added a few mods like the create mod and making all these things work and move like those giants cogs for the dwarven door. Take your aesthetic masterpiece and make it an engineering marvel as well
how do i get this map i already got your patreon
On the final video, if we get a certain amount of likes or views will you give the world download for free?
I was just thinking about THE HOBBIT when i saw the buildings you was building all of that u build was just takling from the HOBBIT and make something from your fantaci and make some great builds. And a Nice detail would be, if you have maked a big treasure-room and I was lokkede off and in the big treasure-room there was. The dragon SMAUG from the HOBBIT laied covered buy the gold and over of his eyes was open and was not covered and if you was down there you never Come back up.  PS fucking Nice build keep up the good work (:
I just hope for you that you can update this world to 1.19, in some 1.18 snapshots you couldn’t update the worlds…
Amazing man you have come so far and you are working so hard and you deliver you and your team proud mate very proud
those build was very good,this  is make u r in the hardcore world or survivng my favorite part os the jungle,mesa,dark forest and the cave
You guys gotta try Steph Bolx's channel. The Story is amazing.
If i ever play this, i dont think im going to break any blocks, this world is just so beautiful
snowy mountains: please make it so that it's a futuristic village that is hiding in the mountains
How did you get all these mods in 1.19 snapshot?
what if this was the new dwarven mines update for hypixel
Also can u do a nether biome? That would be amazing
You should add an Asian/East Asian themed culture in the USW, that'd be really cool. Loving the USW already though
amazing cant wait for the world to be done as well as 1.19!!
Your wolf chief statue is racist no offense don’t let it happen again plz
When this world is finished, it's going to destroy my brain. It's just too amazing!
What tools do you use to make these?  Amazing.
I must say when you built the amethyst and copper factions, that was my favorite part!! NGL the amethyst faction is my favorite.
Awesome!
i dont know why but this bild gave me how to train your dragon vibes
My PS4 would explode if it could download this
I would love to see a Viking reference in the Tiaga biome
Crazy stuff mate
I just subscribed to the channel and will be a member soon, as I am very passionate about the project. I'm starting to watch the other episodes, so my question may have already been answered a thousand times and could create discomfort for the old audience. But if anyone has patience, I would like to know: Will there be a Nether already created by the team millimetrically?  If the answer is no, I wonder why they won't.
Let's hope this becomes cannon to the official Minecraft lore
...how...I’m In shock! It’s all so cool!
if this world was a game on its own with realistic graphics like GTA of TLOF I think it would be one of the greatest of all time
What is the server bc if i want server i can play is gonna good
What about the nether?
this is a modern day bob ross
It would be nice if the copper faction have an armory instead of a library
So damn epic 😭. I was getting into the neo-khuzdul (dwarvish) language and then you updated. Thank you very much for this, it really made my day! I hope you get more and more subscribers because the builds you make take so much time and effort!  Also, the storylines are so great and mysterious. As an author myself, my mind is blown.
Like,for mobs
Is he going to mod this guys?
ahh yes… I see the incredible cave of darkness in which all I see are glowing spots scattered randomly ahhh beautiful…
I can't wait to play this map, but deep down I know my computer is definitely not beefy enough.
hey when everything is done can u pls put the downlaod without patreon for the first week becasue i cant subscribe in patreon my parents wouldnt allow but i rlly want to play this
I AM A DWARF AND IM DIGGING A HOLE
Omg this is just….. AWESOME
Haven’t played Minecraft in years but I really want to break it out just to play this world
i love your vids you'r so good ar bulding and thx for spending so mutch time
Is there any way that i can get the world for free because my parents dont want that i gave money on the internet
Love your builds as usual, but doesn't the Warden break blocks? If you put villagers/animals in those caves or the player walks by, won't it break blocks and charge towards them?
Holy fucking shit bro
I absolutely love your builds. They’re incredibly intricate and well thought out. Have you thought about incorporating more gold into the dwarves builds?. If their main resource is gold, and they’re virtually running nonstop, then maybe it should be more incorporated into the statues, or pillars, to showcase their main export/ resource?
The feeling i get from the status is the dwarves subjugation the other factions that is why all the others are kneeling
Wow that’s is awesome looks amazing but what you should do at the end of this map build is have someone design a mod pack for the world because I reckon is would make it like 100 times better and 100 times more immersive and could add to the story telling and exploration aspect by a lot so please do it
i dont get it, how are u SO GOOD AT THIS, I get tired after just trying to build a half sphere and are recreating all 7 wonders in 1 day
waar zijn jouw wimpers
You! Are! INCREDIBLE! I can´t wait to play the map. Thank You!
Just one question, are you going to build in the nether and the end ?
Those statues... WOW! I'm in awe.
20:39 best shot
Guys the ultimate survival world is almost done c.
Hey I’m I downloaded dragon city and I didn’t get my reward? Little help?
I’m not sure if you’ll be able to do this but you should transform the other realm’s such as the nether and end
This build was insane 🔥  Though would this world have a texture pack of its own to make this world seem real and good for RP
Wow I’m so amazed you added more islands!! 🤯
Will you continue to update the map with new Minecraft updates?
yo what would be epic is a massive civilisation video on this with like 1000 people.
I think you should incorporate a large meeting hall at the center of all the biomes. Sorta like a friendly zone where the chiefs/leaders of the factions can meet.
This is magnificent 😍😍😍!!!
Is this map compatible with console
This keeps getting more and more beautiful.
I can't be the only one who is really excited for this but also wondering whats gonna happen with the oceans.
Holy hell... I wish I could muster 10% of what you put in!
Make a sky city or heaven/paradise
Somebody put this man in Hermitcraft
It's just impressive
You should upgrade the sky with a giant cloud city
Dude I just realized... Once this world is out someone should totally make an RP server (with TB's permission of course and ONLY with his permission)
How is your shader called?
Everyone who watched plz like!
Get to 250k!
that's it I'm fucking killing everyone in this map NO ONE DISRESPECTS DWARVES, NO ONE...Dwarves are the best race to ever exist in any fantasy world (beside Elder Scrolls coz their a disgrace to Dwarves). you got that I won't let ANYONE fuck with Dwarves especially Dain ll Ironfoot coz hes a complete badass who dies at the foot of Erebor AND STILL WINNING, GOD he such a badass...and also Balin is epic too..
Definitely a TRUE survival world at this point lol
you have to much free time
someone please make a mod with new armor weapons, mobs n shit to go with the lore of this map
Why must he put my square home to shame 😭 I wish I had build skills like this
have you though about adding a water/underwater city?
i don't have patreon and i don't want to waste money.  i would love to visit this world once its completed
U are the best man-builder ever
When the world is done will it be available on Bedrock edition? It would look dope with RTX.
Trixy, you should add a small cave thing with walls guarding it all around and then put wardens inside the walls (attack on titan reference)
This is actually the most mind blowing thing I have ever seen. I don't even normally watch Minecraft content but this entire video had me transfixed. Amazing job!
It would be good to put asian style buildings into taiga
THAT WAS INSANE !!!!
Despite the success of the serie, its awesome to see that you’re still passionated about the project and didnt transformed it into a big cash machinery. You could have juste drop it as a 1.16 Map and thats it, but no, you want it to be the USW with all of your heart ✨
300 players on this map would be a lotta fun
10 months already? Damn times flies!
i can’t wait to see let’s plays in this world, and i’ll definitely be playing it in as well !! it’s beautiful, as always. hats off to you trixy
They should add kinds of cloth able to be crafted on armor to muffle house :)

Idk man The build in amazingly impressive but the whole Warden thing is that it has destroyed the city and that's why the underground city is deserted and in ruins.
This is so gloriously excessive I love it so much.
make like a viking design for the snowy mountains and like a village thing on the taiga and like theyre having a war against each other
in my opinion the tiga pepole worshipt a big dragon but the rich guys in the big house stole an inportant tresure and that made that made the dragon turn into stone and die
Incredible job, Trixyblox!
I thought the qarden was already part of 1.18?
I can't believe I've been here since day 1!!!
that map kinda looks like amogus [i am not funny]
Amazing
Add a Vikings live on the snowy mountains biome
Dragon city link isn't working
I doing this on bedrock edition almost done the main island
These manage to blow me away every time, the narration mixed with your talented builds really make this the perfect video. Keep it up!!
Trixy  you forgot about the swamp!!!
I have a random lore idea… what if the dwarfs worshipped the warden which both factors have a chance to roam the library by completing a visit to each of the biomes?  (Just an idea I had lol)
What shaders do you use
Possible character idea: A robotic type person created by an ancient group of people. They roam the land in search of people to sell to! They are a wandering trader type of character although they are extremely powerful due to the items they collect around the world and other dimensions.
Please make this map a bedrock-Java cross play server
Bro, your insane! The quality of those statues, and the scale of everything is blowing my mind...
I can’t wait to discover this world, and I’m even more excited to explore this city. It’s so beautiful, I just love it.
I wonder if you can make it so that if you steal the gems from a tribe they will hunt you down, that could be cool
"Pretty cozy" *immediately adds ominous candles and a painting of a skull on fire*
too infectious.
Are you gonna do the neather and the end?
<3
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.
Do you plan on doing an underwater type city in the future?
WoW👍🏼👍🏼
I wish I could subscribe to you a thousand times. I can't even express how much I love these videos, and thank you so much for making them!!!!
Meanwhile that one guy with low render distance
God can you jus imagine if this got made with create or something?? How amazing would it be if those giant gears and doors actually rolled open and all that
Imagine if this generated naturally in vanilla Minecraft.  That would be awesome!  Btw really good job on the videos as always.  You inspire people like me, so thanks for keeping us all adventurous!
when downloading the world, do the shaders come packed? I need to know, I really want to check this ting out in its full glory!
great work! keep going at it
How is this possible? Is this made by Hand? Are there tools helping?
This is so cool!
Actually incredible! So sad to see that the like goal isn't getting hit :(
Why is the lava falling from the dwarf's hammer and the bridge held up by the king not aligned????  They should meet at the center!!  9:14  It is more evident here
You absolute madman.
just thought about this like the transformation of minecraft from only wood,dirt and stone blocks to  update with monsters and lost cities below the earth soon
I’m just imagining serious events going on here as well as children from the different civilizations coming here on their school trips
Are you also gonna update the nether and end
Hold on. At 12:52 the section below the crane looks kinda like a Minecraft furnace. Was that intentional or accidental?
To let you know someone copyed this idea and it is in the bedrock Minecraft shop (mostly useing the exact same placement but worse)
Is this for Java or bedrock
MAN ,YOU ARE INSANE
I'm super impressed. It seems impossible but keeps getting better every time. A suggestion for the statues; maybe you could use more emeralds in the design/clothing/crown for the jungle king statue? You used some already ofcourse, but just to show his importance compared to the lower two statues, because in his current pose you can't see the emeralds from far of!
This is one madlad
EVERYONE LIKE NOWWWWWWWWWW
Can't believe it's already been tan mothns
Hope you don't mind but I'll  be nicknaming this city "Moria"
Honestly feel proud of him and steph that they did all of that in just 10 months
Only if you owned a NFTworld. damn your world would be incredible
Wow he built all of this in 22 minutes… would have taken me about 10 months…
This cave really reminds me of Breath of the Wild somehow!
Trixy! With all your fantastic talent, you should so join the Sandbox Game community too! I'm a minecrafter at heart, so I know nothing is quite up to the Minecraft experience, but there are some cool things, specially for artists like you that for sure would make the Sandbox world closer to all the great things Minecraft is still yet to become. Who knows? Maybe Mojang or Microsoft see the potential and join Sandbox on a Partnership or something!  Either way, you should so check out MagicaVoxel for pc and Voxel Max for the iPad, if you already haven't. I'd love to see your art in those mediums too! ❤
Dude, amazing job.
i can’t wait to see let’s plays in this world, and i’ll definitely be playing it in as well !! it’s beautiful, as always. hats off to you trixy
So cool
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
every single piece of this is a Work of increnible Art !
But cookie run kingdom
Will this be available to all platforms?
watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlqOV6nyJOY
Are you able to get this on bedrock
All the builds are very beutiful!! But let me ask a qeustion,whats a GIANT dwarf? Jk
Can you please make the taiga a Viking type village
Will the USW be free?
let me ask you wtf bro how so good just like actually wtf how so good
In the snowy mountains build a castle like winterfell from game of thrones
I've never squealed so loud in my life,  this is amazing😀♥
When are you going to done?
PLEASE DO A VIKING/NORSE MYTHOLOGY BUILD IN THE MOUNTAINS WOULD MEAN SO MUCH AND COOL. SEEING I AM A PEAGAN
Alternatively Title: I spent a decade mastering this piece
you guys never cease to amaze me with theses builds and stories. yall keep it up #STAYBLESSED #333
I have an idea. Instead of an above ground amethyst geode have an enormous crater with amethyst spikes and spires pointing out from the middle and smoldering lava in the center. Like when the meteor hit and shattered it sent shockwaves through the land, making curved spikes of amethyst sorta like a downslash shockwave attack in a video game. Like a half a crescent.
HOLY—oh my goodness this is so beautiful and detailed, I can’t imagine how long this took! You are truly a marvel my friend.
I have dragon city already :D
Holy shoot this is SO FLIPPIN EPIC like i'm so impressed with the amazing lore, beautifully done buildings and creative ffn designs like omgg T^T thank you for creating these beautiful masterpieces seeing you guys slowly make this world better and better is always such a joy!💕
This is phenomenal! I love the diagonal dwarf king statue rather than a traditional, flat side model! Very creative and fresh!
I freaking love underground builds so this has easily been my favorite episode so far
Is this world work in minecraft pocketedition  ?
Yesssssssss the Minecraft legend is back!!!!
Maybe you should make a bedrock edition if people don't have java but have bedrock
I love your builds so much and each one gets better. One question, what shaders do you use in these vids?
love the builds but was wandering if u were going to do the nether
For the snowy biome can you build a destroyed Castle on the mountain side
Wow! Just... Wow. I´m lost for words, incredible work! This is real talent!
respekt
I love all the effort that is being put into this project.
Will this be available on the bedrock store?
Just imagine building this in survival
I thought of something cool, what if there is a dwarf graveyard but more like a temple and each grave has a skelk block to hold the dwarfs honor and experiences.
when the survival is complete will I be able to play using Tlauncher and not the official paid mc
It’s all fun and games until your pc can’t run the world
Holy SHIT.
can you make a film at that map  i would subcribe if you make the film
hello, I'm just starting to shoot a video on the channel, I'm shooting recipes. I will be very grateful if you watch and rate my videos, thank you in advance
erabor ?
if the copper dwarfs are all fighters and worriors, i kinda missing a training place for them. we have a forginig place fro the wepons but worriors have nowhere to train. or am i worng
you should make a new survival series using this world once it's finished!!!!!!!!!!!!!
can you build me erebor i will pay you
just amazing
oh sweet lord, i want this to be the next HUGE thing in minecraft, i mean it allready kinda is, but this can evolve in smth so much bigger
What if I already have an account and want that dragon??
my dude just recreated the city under the mountain from the hobbit
For the snowy mountains, could you do a really cold area of the mountain  so cold and abominable that no one explored it?
it would be very cool if you added custom mobs tools and items
Make the Taiga a russian themed
you can certainly tell that the Dwarves haven't fully forgotten about their issues and grudges with the surface dwellers despite the jungle king's best efforts. Just look at the positioning and poses of those statues... :D  Also are you planning to do anything with the ocean monument and undersea ruins? What about the coral reefs?
When this map is finished, you should host an event of factions for each civilization. Last one to survive wins.
So how about the nether
What About Axolotls!
Are you gunna change the Nether and the end in this world?
Wow I love the hobbit and the lord of the Rings and you captured that style perfectly. I love it so much!
Please use mods to make those weapons and npc
just wow imagine this worlD with create
hello , i wanted to give you the idea of making the snow or taiga  biome as a viking biome ...  thx me
Build the mob grinder from minecraft story mode
that men is dirty and gross af, yo look at this sweaty boiiiiiiiii.
Fantastic looking build!!  Love the Dwarven theme (fan of LOTR's).  Only thing that drove me nuts was the lava flow off the Dwarven statue wasn't centered.  My OCD kicked in lol.
Minecraft: *Upgrades Caves Trixy Blocks: *upgrades caves more
Will the usw be available on bedrock
Please add Star of David 🔯 to the dark forest synagogue
The funny thing about this world, is that technically its surface area is larger than Mars' moon Deimos.
Oof, if only this was going onto the minecraft marketplace. Consoles are nice but this world is better!
Can bedrock player's play to????
Are you gonna do the nether? I think it would be sooo cool! Love the video! Nice work!
Please upgrade end and nether as well
statues are insane
Sadly if you look at the views and likes. They are getting lower and lower. I know it’s incredibly hard. But you need to bring them out faster. Still love it though. Just some facts
It looks all so damn epic, especially because of the glowing effect of different types of lights in contrast to the dark blocks!🤩
super nice
Are you going to make this a mod? I really want to play it, it looks so good?
i want to write a novel using this as a reference ... is it ok
This map will go down in Minecraft history 🙌
Like skyrim
This was crazy amazing, my favorite one so far!  Keep up the great work!
Could you build in the snowy mountains a massiv ice cave ?
Please build a Knightly order city inspired by Bretonia from warhammer 2 in your next video pls
That is awesome! I don’t really want to think about how long this took because that is a lot of work. Even with world edit. My brain hurts just thinking about if.
This is the best  USW's  upgrade
For the nether, I feel like you could build a throne with a demon on it. You cN also throw in erupting volcanoes as well as making the fortress much more massive.
This is becoming so so good! im so happy im following this journey!!  i do really really hope that you will take into cosidiartion of using  pieces of the sami culture in the snowy mountains. Id really like to see more cultures since youve kind off already done the typical "american movie cultures" you know
one thing that would make this world even cooler is if u make challenges like maybe find this  item and put a hint in the text that would make the world way more intresting and so u can learn more lore also threw that way
It would be very cool if this world had o mod for it so there would actually be npc,s custom weapons and that kind of stuff
When can we play this map?it is so cool!
I get exited for every new version. I feel like every new update is the best one yet.
This is incredible! Reminds a lot of Skyrim's dwarven structures and Blackreach, which is basically an underground hub connecting all the dwarven dungeons together.
What about the swamp, maybe a sky island or something
Upgrade the ocean monument, end world and nether :)
i really liked the amethyst rooftops designes tbh
trixyblox, the god of building and design. love to see it, and definitely some needed inspiration. much love
my mans, you have such a big imagination it’s insane ❤️
@Everyone. Click That, Like Button 🔥
Video actually starts at 4:20
Definitely one of my favourite builds by far! The amount of detail and creativity, just jaw-droppingly amazing!!!
This is my favourite build in this series
Amazing  It would be super cool if you add a version with mods to give even more live to the places 🔥
Not gonna lie, this place is the best out of them all. Although I was kinda expecting some sort of nether portal somewhere in it. Either way, still epic!
Add new ores
where do you get your inspiration from for your designs and builds?
I really love ur work, it's very beautiful but I've one question. It's possible to do a french version of adventures on ur map ? Sorry if my english is bad haha ^^'
when u have a huge amount of skill and a huge amount of free time
the dwarfen archetecture you have created really looks like the archetecture from the Hobbit
It looks great! but i'd like to see a deeper, darker and abandonned ancient deep dark city with dark secrets inside of it. Ah yes, and i'd like to see your take on dungeons
Just wow
Please add Indian culture in any of the biome
You have drawf why don't have elf
you should do a play through to this when you are done with mods for more fun
If I manage to play in this masterpiece, I would rather not to break any blocks because everything is just good.
I want this map so much it looks so awesome
When you transform the end?
this is the best series!!!!!!!!!!!
The nether
18:25 Ironic they became the prisoners of the prison they're supposed to be guarding because wardens are prison guards
I can not wait to play this amazing world this is insane i love this video’s to watch keep up the good work
I would suggest adding a Hindu temple with indian architecture.  I would be Unique, interesting and fun to explore!
Your builds are fantastic  Will you be modifying the nether and end dimensions? I think it could have massive potential
Hypixel skyblock shud hire u man
Hey i'm a dwarf and i'm digging a hole, diggy diggy hole, digging a hole!
Do this in the Nether
dear youtube algorithm,  stop showing me minecraft videos.
Please add pirates
I would want to support with money but im broke
Imagine you play in phone 💀
Will it be available for consoles?
make sure there's some ventilation for the cave because with all that fire heat and burning materials
It's epic and I would still love to play it... BUT by now it has lost its "vanillaness" for me. I mean, the "glass fire" building trick for example looks great from a distance but it ruins the mood quickly if you see one close during roleplaying. Giant cranes was ok, a single person wont be able to operate them so  it's just a bunch of abandoned wood material packed.... I could belive it would exist inside minecraft, but a giant forge with this many imitated funktional parts... just way over the top to be called vanilla/playable like  I'm not against the scale, im against certain building tricks that doesn't make sense an this many funktional parts.
I Think Is Great If You Add A Kingdom Like A Kingdom That Dominate The Surface
all i can say is "AMAZING"
Ngl the shape is kinda sus...
Cant wait for the release of this world
I can litteraly imagine a Ultimate chaos island movie with all these aspects.
The deepslate frame is a portal like end portal frame
How do you even come up with this stuff?
The dwarf statue in the back at 20:40 looks really cool. Just saying
mannn I'd love to see a movie abouy this world
I  CANT WAIT UNTIL THIS IS FINISH, ME AND MY FRIENDS ARE EXITED TO PLAY THIS
Wow….. just wow…. This is incredible
Reminds me a lot of Blackrock Mountain in World of Warcraft.
I didn’t think it was possible, but this area is even cooler than the ones you built above ground. I’m in awe!
Amazing!
I’d love to see something like a Greek temple somewhere in this world! Maybe on top of one of the mountains?
thanks
Please please please let the map be free and please put it on the app store cause I don't have the money🙏🙏🙏🙏
Abi cok güzel videolar yapıyorsun ekstra okyanusda yapabilirsin
I officially now see TrixyBlox as Minecraft's best Loremaster
5:55 amogus    im sorry
I think you should use red fire and orangish themed buildings on the copper  side of the city
how is this survival friendly, you are using blocks that take a long time to make as decorative blocks
Imagine if the forge actually moved, that would be amazing, I can actually think of a few ways to do it.
De cave looks rllyyy doope! Well done
I have no words for you trixy... The underground statues look beautiful.. Even beyond beautiful... They're like historical wonders.. I really cannot explain how I feel, but know this, I am glad to have been subscribed to you. You have outdone yourself mate. Keep it up buddy.
NEXT : MAKE A ATLANTIS
Why do I feel like I will have to sell my kidney and buy a rtx 3090 after this survival world is finished?
Question will you update the nether  🤔
It would be pretty cool if you used this world on a 100 players event
So cool
Greetings TrixyBlox, I am currently recruiting youtubers for a large project, I hope you will consider...
Don’t forget the nether
Can you play this map on minecraft bedrock edition?
You know what I want… This to be the official Minecraft Tutorial world 2022.
3:36 the actual video starts from here
Wow, thanks for all the effort real treat to watch 👍
A lot of people may question. How does he do it? He has trained his brain to remember how to build very abstract but beautiful builds
WHOA. that is AMAZING.
лагает наверное 0_0
please move the camera further away, it's a very uncomfortable distance
Wait wait wait, you want the warden to be the mini boss of the dwarven mines? You do know the warden has 2.5 times the ho of the elder dragon right?
I sadly don’t have java edition and truly hope that this can be converted to bedrock. I also would enjoy doing a series on exploring this entire area on my channel.
we really need mods to  make the story real
Honestly what you've done for the Minecraft community is insane! Keep up the amazing work you're doing, can't wait until the U.S.W. is released!
Do the dwarves have vitamin D deficiency?
why don't u build somrthings in the hell?
Downloadable for bedrock?
Dragon
Jaw dropping build but the warden is not a mini boss it has more health than the wither and ender dragong
I find it funny that in the Dragon City ad, they used a Ice&Fire Dragon egg to hatch what is clearly not a Ice&Fire Dragon
Awsome video but can you add my steam punk hidden bace idea in the snowy mountains or let me know you did or don't want to do it? Have a good day
I'm curious to see how the island will look like without shaders
I'D WILL LOVE LIVING IN THIS CITY'S
Anyone else feel like at the very end of this build series, there will be a mod pack recommendations, so it feels more alive, than the bland vanilla mobs?
U should start a survival series after the usw
Rip off DragonVale sponser
Hmmm.. would love to see the nether transformation soon....
Hey Trixy, would it be possible to add this world to a public survival server? It’s completely non-profit and has a fairly small community. I’d be sure to give you credit for the world.
If people were willing/able to, I could see thousands of people being allocated a civilisation and a small group being new foreigners to the island for a massive roleplay world.
We need a nether and an end transformation too!!!
Love what you are doing with this creation! I have been watching this series from the start and each time i have to ask myself, “how am i going to be blown away this time?” Because no matter what i see or what you do i am always blown away. The dwarven city was absolutely amazing and i love the lore behind it, and i cant wait to be able to get a much clearer view of the story when it comes!! I also can not wait to have this opened up to be able to share it with my friends, i have already showed them many videos of it and they are just as excited as me to get the chance to play on this world!
can u PLEAASEEEEEEEEEEEEE upgrade the desert well 😏
When is the map or sever available?
Absolutely amazing job once again! The amount of work you put into details not even shown in the video is crazy!
Once you are finished make sure you reach out to some cool youtubers so they can play this world as an SMP world. I would love to see some professional players play rather than plan myself on this
I feel like this world is a great place to rile play I wish I had a computer to play on and years after you release this world  I hope all the structures will not be severely messed up
I would love to see a Norse-inspired culture! Especially, with a nautical aspect to the society just like the Viking Age. A pagan/heathen temple would be great too and maybe use architecture inspired by the Stave Churches found in Norway. Oh, and please add runestones throughout the biome. Either taiga or snowy mountains would be fine.
So..... are you gana updated the swamp?
God loves u all ❤
anyone know what shadders he's using?
this is awesome
Can’t wait to play
This cave update looks so sick, I love the design
A BABY GLOW SQUID 9:03 on the left
how big is the world file size?
This is so good. What the heck
I don't have the money to buy the USW, but I was amazed.
Wish I could get the Map
with the machines I mean
do not wory i will make your dream a reality
bro you just beat hypixel skyblock
This will be connected to the cities?
You should do the End and the Nether too
I didn’t think it was possible, but this area is even cooler than the ones you built above ground. I’m in awe!
The next thing after you are ready with the world, as a minor upgrade would be some npc that would buy and sell stuff
im getting "the hobbit" vibes
Make a China town in the Taiga, since it's got snow making it look like it's Chinese New Year every day
Suggestion/question/challenge can you transform Minecraft bedrock edition's END
This brings back a lot of memories of LOTR
Can't wait to see my fav minecraft youtubers to have a let's play series such as Geminity, Mythicalsuages and Fwip. Good job
I absoulely love this series!!!
if this amazing world were to be combined with the create mod, imagine the epicness
how can anyone dislike this? I don't see anyone else doing this
To be honest i know for a fact that there will be 100 days in hardcore video on it
You had make the ruined buildings
I really love how you used the Draven Architecture from the Hobbit
Hoping he would make a giant vault where all diamond blocks and netherites are kept and find the secret key to open it,that would be cool
I have been waiting for months and finally it has come true
Please give me seed
This must've taken forever to make
Yea I’m going to make a copy of this seed
in the tiaga update can their be a queen or female leader?
It would take me years to build this
We need abandoned cities/villages
This looks beautiful! As a descendant of indigenous people from the Amazon rainforest, I felt a little disappointed that the jungle king didn't have anything that made his culture stand out. The Wolf Chief and Pharaoh had headpieces that represented their culture and I was kinda expecting the jungle king would too.
19:44 The Mines of Moria
As a Skyrim nut this gives me so much Skyrim vibes that I really love it looks amazing
You should add some jails and Mini quests like stop the Out landers from painting on the great leaders statues Etc…
sorry philza but this is sooooo better buts philza yours is too :)
trixy plzzzz build a volcano at the end of mountains and at the base of volcano lives master armourers who are with an alliens with dwars as the lava comes from the volcano through natural small fishers to the caves it will make the map more interesting  plzzz
have you ever thought about being a architect?
🤯 Every episode gets better than the last one! Keep it up, there is nothing that’s remotely close to this in the Minecraft community! I’d personally join the amethysts because I’m more of a creative/intellectual person. I’d probably be playing some music in one of the halls of the amethyst part of the city.
this is awsome!
I want ot say something this looks intense also can you upgrade the dungeons and stronghold in your usw
This inspires me to play Minecraft!! This is really cool 😎
Trixy, the amount of effort and magic you bring to life in this SINGLE MINECRAFT WORLD is surreal. the detail you put into every single little thing is just amazing, i cant believe something like this is even possible. i cant wait to see this world fully complete!!
I didn’t think it was possible, but this area is even cooler than the ones you built above ground. I’m in awe!
Are you going to release that map on the Nintendo switch?
This was cool but suggestion, if they build a city next to amethyst geodes, wouldn't it be smart to make one that's mostly broken or mined?
This was an Epic transformation! btw Trixy, I have not yet seen you add any birch trees to the USW yet so dont forget to do that if you haven't already. Keep up the great work!
This is actually insane!
i remember when you posted the video you mention at 7:10 Your talent and persistence with your builds is among that of top minecraft gamers. I salute you
Will you still be updating this world with any other new possible biome or building updates to the original Minecraft worlds? Great work looks absolutely amazing! Will definitely be playing on the world.
Nice work! I feel like a germanic culture akin to vikings with architectural influences linked to paganism, i.e: heathen hofs would be the most fitting for a snow biome. Either that or moscow.
Great video as always, can you do either the Taiga biome or the Tundra in a Viking style with a Stave-Church?
I would love to see a mod pack that adds in plot relevant items along with maybe a functioning train mod for the old west, but that's perhaps asking a little bit too much (asking a lot. Just saying it would be cool not asking for it. Please don't take it the wrong way The build itself is enough)
Not my favorite episode but still pretty great keep up the good work
i like the architecture and composition, but i do find the underground build very derivative of your past underground city build, and you fall into the same pits   its one large open area, with some multi-layer things thrown in it; it doesnt feel like a cave chiseled by dwarves with layers in mind  and the colors are primerely dark grey, grey, and brown you of course have more color variation with the flags and the rooves, but i think it could benefit from you know, feeligh bright and saturated hanging banners! bunch of lamps! colorful buildings and pathways! have lave next to soul fire for contrast! so much stuff you could throw against the dark background to make it super bright and interesting! y'know
It would make a little more sense if they used glowstone over campfires for light or have ventilation shafts
I am in love with the underground builds
the dwarven lore sounds a little bit like the elder scrolls lore... i like it
This cave project is AMAZING I'm imagining implementing this cave with the Create mod
All I can really say is wow...just wow.
I'll be honest, I was hoping for a deeper, blocked off dwarven city that had been overrun with skulk and the wardens, and the dwarves abandoning it leaving many treasures behind  Overall though this is an utterly amazing project so far, and with all this lore you could totally get some people to make a modpack that integrates into this map insanely well, and create a Minecraft experience on a scale never before seen.
your so cool🤩
You should make some Polynesian inspired builds on the naturally generated islands
This would be a cool anime ngl
I am confused, how are you so good at building I am 67/100 , you 250/100 I love your content, keep up the good work.
This is awesome 👌
Junge das tumbniel sieht aus wie fortnite digga wtf
imagine building this in survival
I can barely build a tree house, and this guy..:. He builds the whole Minecraft 🤯
the deep dark city reminds me if have city from artemis fowl
So next is sky,neither and end?
nerf miner
This series is awesome. I do think you’d get more views with a more captivating thumbnail. They’re all too similar
you could just leave the cave generation do its thing around the city
What shaders are you using?
What about the nether and the end?
It would be cool if you could make a pirates Cove somewhere on the map
I love this I just wish the Dwarven statue was two headed, basically the hammer the Amethyst craftsmen and axe the Copper warriors
Image if he hosted a Minecraft civilization simulator in this ultimate survival world when he’s done.
i kinda dont like how they are other islands beside the island
I think a statue of Fafnir would have been a nice add on too
bro sheshhhhhhhh i wouldn t make this if a had my entire life
Please make the end Dimension Nether and all structures over there more epic than the vanilla Minecraft!!!!!! I hope he reads this  Edit: oh don't forget to upgrade Stronghold too ( the way to the end )
Forge like you touched on really brought back the memories of the dozen times I have read and watched all of the hobbit, and especially the extended editions of DoS and BotFA, in which their is so much intrigue in the caverns of Erebor, all the way from the foundry’s to the halls, and especially the molten gold causeways, and the chase with Smaug coming after them as they ride the minecarts down the rivers of metal
The city style really reminded me of Minas Tirith from LoTR, in how it is tiered and layer getting smaller and nicer as you climb your way up
Wait u need a birch biome its also a different tree type maybe u can add a flower Forest to it with a birch village and then a secret well next to it with a log cabin mix it with oak trees too to have a unique look
I love the dwarf so much! It looks sick!!!
How to get that map?
699,000TH VIEW
as soon as I heard dwarves my mind instantly thought of diggy diggy hole
This build looks sick!
Camera work at 12 minutes going crazy I love it
Yo, I wish I said this earlier, but I try think it would be super cool to take inspiration from the city menzoberranzan in northwestern Faerun in the Toril forgotten realms DnD setting. It is a subterranean drow (dark elf) city, and concept art for it is super cool
You improved more every time I watch your videos it’s like your skills keep improving keep up the good work
Epic! I wonder what Tolkien would think...
This is actually so awesome
can you do the ocean
this build was too good. Best underground build i have ever seen
I can see many people making a lot of SMP in this
Viking in the taïga pleeeeeeeeeeass
Pov: Lockdown
You should make the nether custom if you go through the nether portal that you made, it would be really cool to re-create the fortress and bastion
i hope u put in a mod so every village has different villagers as well as make them have realistic “attitudes”
Would be interesting to see the nether be upgraded especially when players fix that nether portal ruin.
You are INSANE! I am mind blown by your work!  Do you ever get sick of Minecraft?😅
this is my favourite "biome" now, you're great at building and I just love the statues!! can't wait for it to be finished!
Imagine if he made his own mod pack that had specific weapons that are better than diamond or something? Or New characters?
Jesus Christ is Lord confess with your mouth that he is Lord get baptized put God first seek him with all your mind body and soul love your neighbors as yourself. Seek God while we still have time. Be blessed brothers and sisters
How the heck has mojang not try to hire this man yet
Now, you are better than Grian at building
Minecraft should add different civilizations that are large and or small and are more advanced or less advanced and you can help advance these civilizations/citystates/countries. From tribes to empires. It would be so cool and it would add so much content to minecraft.
Can you make a city like Sofya from toram online?
meanwhile there is me doing square houses
When can we get this
This is insane. I was happy to watch an 1h video but to find out that he compressed it into only a 20m video is amazing. Not to mention the story, earned my subscription
you gonna convert the nether and end too?
All of your builds are just amazing!!  But for me personally this is my fav
You should really be designing your own game, this is amazing
Your videos are amazing! the amount of time and quantity you put on your videos and on youtube is astonishing, dont stop keep up the good work.
I think you should “update it” in 1.19 so that you can add all the actual skulk blocks instead of warped stem. But still, better than grian
You should make a guidebook for some lore and to help find your way
i would join the copper faction
Bro is just built different
Will there be a bedrock version of this map?
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Is it just me or does this have big Lord of the ring vibes? Another amazing job my trixyblox well done 👍👍👍
This projects is so ambitious! It would be fantastic to litter about some sci-fi/movie references around the map as low-key Easter eggs. I’d love to help out with that.
Now I'm more scared with the new update.
When this finished, I wanna see youtubers playing it
3:35 when it really starts :/
Transform the nether. in the same world incorporate a nether portal in the masa biome
Your creativity is incredible.
The building legend is back boiis!
Get rid of the scult blocks they spawn a warden each time they go off
The Wardens dig underground and despawn after 60 seconds, without being alerted of anything
you've got midas' touch man
This guy is a great builder but try doing it without world edit currently on xbox two year old realm 7 kingdoms so far have my own crew of builders everything placed by hand
I think it would be a great idea to incorporate a dragon/ dragon tribe in the snowy mountains that ancestors slain an ice dragon centuries ago and over decades have built a great civilisation around the legend of this tale. Keep up the great work, I’ve just stumbled across this series and have watched all the videos till now. I love the truly remarkable builds and how everything is coming together!
This..... Is....... INCREDIBLE !!!!!
Awesome. I was a bit sceptical when i Saw that u were upgradig caves. But u always surprise me
This is so incredible my guy, I'm looking forward to explore this entire world! I think I might even make my own lore with it :D
you better have put some axolotls in that water! love the build
Back on trending bro!! I'm so godamn excited
Wow, The more I see a new map update the mire it makes me want to play it :(
I bet the next biome transformation will be the swamp and that Trixy will wait until the full release or a future snapshot of 1.19 for the new Mangrove Swamp and frogs and all that stuff.  Edit: Nevermind, I forgor that the USW doesn't have a swamp
i want to see ice temple in snowy mountains
In the snowy mountains can you do the Northern Water Tribe from Avatar the last Airbender please.
I love this guy he is soo talented :) have a nice day TrixyBlox
Are you able to add usw on the market place?
Your constructs are quite good, it's very remarkable, that also almost not everybody can do it, what is sure is that your work is rather nice (I don't judge), I can say it's perfect,  So I finished my speech 😂 (yes I know I'm pushing it a bit), I'll leave you another comment... Keep on regaling us 😋 Bye bye
This might be my favourite episode so far
Can I quickly say as a suggestion u should make it so the player has to restart the forge? And by doing that they can be give really good gold items? Perhaps?
Have you seen the beauty of this vid 666k views😂😂😂  Get it 666 THE DIVEL IS HERE
I wanna se this map in a form of rpg like wynncraft
Guys, we need your help to stop the genocide war in Ukraine. Put the pressure on your government all you can, they must close the sky above Ukraine so we can stop putin's nazis for good.
Imagine this map with Ray tracing
The cave gives me hobbit vibes
I think you should add more light sources behind statues or use different materials to build them, because they blend with background too much. Otherwise I love it.
This is amazing!!! Do you also upgrade the other dimensions (Nether, End) and the ocean or even the sky with a ballooncity
Will you also upgrade the nether and the end?
Imagine some-one using this as an SMP having creeper explosions turned off just to not damage the builds. I could see this becoming a fun thing for a small group to do together.
here before 1 million views
Just wondering, do you plan on also uploading the finished map to the bedrock marketplace to make it available for all players???
how is it with the End and the Nehter
living legend
When tf will they upgrade End?
This isn’t even going to work as a survival world. There’s wayyy to much resources and free stuff. I’m not sure what world your living in but this ain’t good lmao
Guys, we need your help to stop the genocide war in Ukraine. Put the pressure on your government all you can, they must close the sky above Ukraine so we can stop russian nazis for good
Top 5: Bad Things to be with a RUSSIAN WOMAN... https://youtu.be/YSZ0VvFbu24
omg dragon city! brings back so many memories lol
He said "250k likes for the next usw episode" as if he will just ditch this project if he doesn't hit the like goal
I love everything about this
It's a shame to build a dirt hut in this world
My in bedrock knowing I can't play this: uhh interesting
ive been looking forward to the snowy mountains for sooo long now pls gib <3  love the project
Suggestion: Make settlements outside the huge island, that were colonies of the cultures on the island. Those should look similarly to their mother cultures, but need to have subtle differences (depending on the new disadvantages and advantages on the settlements). Would love to see that, love your videos and amazing dedication!
If you do the snowy biome next can you put a huge frozen statue of god that only the people that live there know,and that they are Christian’s but that there is an epic story to it🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
how about an epic statue of a female?
Dude you need to get someone to make a plugin that adds custom weapons/armor to this and then get a texture pack with it, basically a mod but it'd be cool.
Builders be like at start this build looks terrible at end best build in world
This is so sick, ur a veeeery good builder
Peak MineCraft
What are you supposed to do in this world actually, most players won't outdo any of the builds you made, so for me that kind of kills the best thing about minecraft
Am i the only one getting erebor vibes?
Question, will this be available on pocket edition? Cause (sadly) it’s the only version I have besides education ;-;
every episode of this I watch, I cannot wait to even download it, yet load in the world. Also what if there can be a backstory of why the USW is isolated from the rest of the world. I would love to see that
who else had dragon city before it was a sponsred game
Every time I hear the whole subscribe thing I think of only 1 youtuber, it is becouse the more people where subscribed (almost 80%!) then unsubbscribed
can you make a hockey rink in the taiga even as a small easter egg?
The I-BMN is quite an interesting concept. I wonder how the cultures differ between "humans" and dwarves.
The desert needs more stuff is so boring other than those two things
Fcking beautiful. I love the deep dark dwarven caves
Jean this IS reali Nice build
The mountains and/or taiga need to have an old nordic style.
You don’t have to do commands to get the sculk blocks just open your inventory and find them they were added about 4 or 6 months ago
Everytime he transforms something, I'm like "yhup, this is my fav one", and then he makes an even cooler one in the next video 😅
I'm afraid that my phone will explode when I download this.
i can’t wait to see let’s plays in this world, and i’ll definitely be playing it in as well !! it’s beautiful, as always. hats off to you trixy
Aren't dwarves 'sposed to be short?
you could create a resource pack with the weapons and tools from the dwarfs and you can name a axe to turn it into a warhammer
AMETHYST GEODES CAME IN 1.17 NOT 1.18!!!!!!
wow
Can't wait for 1.19 :)
why you doin this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odUZyJrup4c
Just asking but will there be custom mobs idk if u already mentioned it
bro that end time-lapse was epic
Br he started last year and now WW3 is starting. we had no clue when the first USW world vid came out
Also idk what it is about the jungle king statue buts it’s sick, like I can’t put my finger on it but it’s just incredible.
i think it's a good idea to add tinkers construct to make the forge functional
If you ever wanted to you could make some big abandoned civilizations on those 1.18 generated lands where the people who sailed to the island came from
wow
Bro is this going to be in pocket and bedrock edition????
Can’t even begin to think how long this must have taken.Great vid, love the story!!!
It just hit me! USW Island looks like _Amphibia!_ A giant lily pad island!
Will you be coding this?
This guy should build on 2b2t
You've turned minecraft into a new artform.
This is amazing! I'm still working on my Skyrim inspired dwarven dungeon I started in 1.13 update, haven't even started on my Moria build yet! 🤯
cool
This is looking great
As always, incredible
I know you did a coven or witches in the Mushroom Biome, but if it fits into any of your remaining builds might you consider a pagan covenstead as a place of worship? I'd be happy to provide references for my pagan church's location as well as the plans and current layout of my covenstead. ^^
Amazing
NEED ARCHER TOWERS
How would I be able to get your worlds from your patron
Looks like Lord of rings
pog. new upload
Best birthday gift ever 🎉🎊👏🏿
this build should be in minecraft marketplace
Will you add some custome weapons?
I am gonna be honest its ginormous and i Love it!
Are there going to be custom mobs/weapons and armor that go along with the story? I'm pretty sure as it's shown in the video but I'd love to know more about those if so lol
We need a texture pack for special items. With optimize this is achievable, meaning special swords or items have a different look than vanilla, like with hypoxia skyblock texture packs
use glow lichen to light up the caves :>
The map will be free or no because I actually really want to do a survival world here
This man is way too good.
As a person who likes origami imma join ameythist fanctions
This content is soooo good. I love the breakdown of everything in this build. You are truly talented.
So cool!!!! Thanks for all the work you do, Trixy!
As happy as I am that this exists I wish it could be an actual game with good npcs interactive mini games and a forced story line
So cool is amazing
I can't wait for this to be released! I want to play the world so bad. I also want to play with adding some custom items to the world. It seems like the perfect place to test a lot of the things I would try to add and balance in minecraft.
I love how he calls the warden a “mini boss” when its literally the strongest boss in the game and can one shot full enchanted nether it’s armor
All these builds really are amazing in scale and quality, but if you’re upgrading Minecraft, I feel like everything you’ve been building so far is a bit… too big. I could be wrong, maybe it will be different when I’m actually there playing it, but I feel like the scale of everything is not quite the Minecraft feel. Not a bad thing, but.. ya know what I’m sayin? The huge scale makes it feel a bit less like vanilla Minecraft.
Freaking awesome 😍
Omg this is so amazing as always. Please do the Nether dimension and maybe the End dimension too!
LETS GO AFTER SO LONG sorry I got too excited
Hi
how to make camera flys like these? its plugin mod?  i hope u did not do it manually.
This is just stupidly good.
can't wait till it's finished, probably one of the only maps i'd buy
Are you going to do the neather and the end as well? I love the caves looks ammazing
Good
I love how you made the liquid gold pouring into the forge! So much color under a cave that goes so well with the deep slate but not too much color that it doesn’t feel like a cave anymore. I keep getting more and more impressed as this video and series goes on.
what i find really cool is that the gateways to the biomes look kind of like the ministry of magic main hallway from harry potter!
Bro the statues man of the charts, you put so much effort into your videos and I love them can’t wait for the finished product
I really want to know please let this be in. bedrock
HELL YEAH
Hmm i wondered if the things that's stopped you from mining into that places is trap, barrier, bedrock, lots of obsidian plus lava or more deep dark places with warden.
Bro imagine this with forging and crafting mods
in fact you can do a minecraft social experiment
As next project you could build the backrooms. (the main nine levels)

2 Chronicles 7:14 if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land..
Question will this be available for pe and bed rock

Wake up babe! TrixyBlox just posted a new video!
bro making perfect mmo rpg map <3
I wish I had thst talent
https://youtu.be/BZrYTQ18Xg0
I… I have no words
Thirst 3 Minuten 40 seconds are literally just trashtalking
You should add some villagers
Rock and Stone!
I absolutely love all your videos, I'll check out the jungle ep on Steph's channel soon!
what about an iceberg biome upgrade? With a fishermen town
That's one of the most ambitious projects I've ever discovered! I would love to give the island a try when it's done!
The Erebor was quiet since this came out
Minecraft needs to just straight up hire you to be their new lead designer.  The things you come up with are insane.
We need to get this man on Hermitcraft
Everyone check my new song I just dropped from uk 🔥
Will there be Custom  and new mobs ?...🙄👀
hey thixy I have a idea, I don't know if u thought about this or someone else told but try adding modded armor,tools,weapon new blocks etc. it would make ur ultimate Survival world even more better I mean the word(relics) u used will define modded things really well.btw I love ur videos good job, keep working on it.
The image for the video looks like fortnite map
this world is turning into a scary monster
That looks like a Bionicle’s map lol
"Aight, let me make an entire underground country." 😂
in the sword and axe memorial, if the part of sword and axe were made of weathered copper, it would be more beautiful
This is my Favorite  build yet
after you finish the usw you shuld do asgard
You know a good idea would be is the player spawns on one of the random biomes. And a starter kit is given to him that's base on the biome theme he spawned on.
Oh and if u see this vid plz like or else he won’t release the Taiga Biome vid soo like plz like the video
im SHOOKED!!!! THATS INSANE!!!!!  I CANT EXPLAIN HOW AMAZIED I AM!
Bruh when will the taiga video Be coming out I’m soo exited for that one ur soo talented honestly
mount olimpus in the snowy mountain
Can you add a watch in the mountains called Doug's Lodge?
You should also do the nether and end
Wow... This is gorgeus! For me, The USW is done, but... yeah
Maybe it could be cool to add a place with ruins of statue and stuff... also check out the disney movie Atlantis for good inspiration :)
Add more protection to the caves like add skulck shriekers so that wardens can spawn. Maybe could be a defence mechanism the cave dwellers incoperated and mad friends with some friendly wardens
What about making all  these ancient buildings from every biome look like they are ruined?
I haven't even watched the video yet, but it's gonna be amazing.
How will we survive hereHow will we survive hereHow will we survive here? I can't even break a block in this world! Everything is so beautiful!
Baruk khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu! 🧔‍♀ The Dwarves of Kazad Dum would be proud! Something many get wrong and maybe you can add something like it is a giant hammer. The thing most get wrong about weapon and tool making is, you don't cast weapons and just sharpen the edges. They would be far too briddle. You need hammers and anvils to work the material and give it the right strength. I hope you did not encase the city completely in bedrock only the roofs so we can later extend the city into the depths of the deep dark.
Can't believe the put the island of Voya Nui into Minecraft
Awesome!
Hey Would u make Shaders/ modes? Witch one will help get better in map
Upgrade the end and nether
Is it coming to PE because i really wanna play that map if it isn't its fine
why does this remind me of the dwarven capital city of world of warcraft lol
I can already see the million minecraft YouTubers who are gonna play this map when it's done I can't play it because I'm mobile but I'll enjoy the reactions of YouTubers
I have a suggestion for another video you should do a house in every update but with 1.17 1.18 and 1.19
Not gonna lye, this current iteration of the deep dark city really didn’t age well at all. When comparing the state the city to vanilla of course.
Do you need a new world when the 1.19 update arrives or will it added to the world i already play in?
Will this be a survival public server?
Would be neat if he did a nether build so when the portal is finished you spawn somewhere really cool!
I am wondering will this just be a map or will there be a mod that would be associated with it? Like some mod or mods that incorporate fantasy elements.
this is amazing and all, but wont the copper in the banners age and turn green?
Although you have made great builds but this cave one is my personal favourite keep on
i actually unsubed for the sun-begging
Just a friendly reminder to anyone reading this comment, this is Minecraft that you’re watching.
this is absolutely amazing
I have no idea what to say this is bloody insane and words can’t described it
TrixyBlox, what would it take to have you as my Minecraft build teacher? I need you to teach me how to build builds like yours! They're AMAZING! And basically impossible to replicate or make something with the same build technique!
my intelligence: +2  This guys intelligence: + 99999999999999999
This map would make a good movie set
I’m curious to know if there will be a nether and End. It will be AWESOME to fly around the USW with an elytra
I didn’t think it was possible, but this area is even cooler than the ones you built above ground. I’m in awe!
is this available for bedrock edition?
To whoever is reading this : May God bless you ! You’re gunna do great for ur school year ! Put God first and everything will fall into place ! John 3:16 says , “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life!!!!. “ 💕 JESUS IS THE ANSWER TO EVERY PROBLEM YOU ARE FACING ! HE IS THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING ! He loves you and I love you too ❤️
I have an idea. You should make a mod for all of the creatures in the world so they are also special. Maybe the last episode?
SO EXCITED FOR THIS!!! I've never been so quick to support a creator on patron! tysm for the hard wokr @TrixyBlox team!!
random question: is the warden one of the 13 sins? and if yes then wich sin does it represent?
A collab with SystemZee to add more uniqueness to USW?
@TrixyBlox world file size is going to  be huge so can you make a server for bedrock
It is time to get right with Jesus. nobody is automatically gonna go to heaven at the end of it, we all have lied or stolen or had sex before marriage and the punishment is hell. Jesus died so you can get a clean slate and forgiveness of future sins if you repent of them once you commit them, so you receive the gift of forgiveness by following him. When you start you have to stop sinning, and follow his word and obey it. That’s following Jesus. Read your Bible
Glad that I found your channel. You really got a cool content ❤️😎  Keep posting!
Lets goooo
Can you add elfs in Taiga?
Omg it,s epice
Fuking insane, great job, keep the amazing work up m8
Me is confuse
11# on trending sus
wow, just wow
Best episode yet!
This is incredible, absolutely beautiful and can’t wait to explore it when it available. Just an idea, maybe you should do the Sami people in snowy mountains? (The Sami are an indigenous people who have their traditional settlement in the northern areas in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia, from ancient times they lived in lavvos, large tents. many engaged in reindeer herding,others lived off fish or agriculture. Keep up the good work! 💪🏻
wow, i can't wait to play this map
Gut
Are you going to include non-lore related villages? So that theres more than one per biome? And are the different villagers going to have new skins pertaining to their tribe?
I cant wait to play on this map i have watched from the begging and i am so exited
Imagine if someone makes a 1-2 hours animation/movie using this map and its lore that would be amazing to watch
Great video
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YeV1CS5zIsI
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YeV1CS5zIsI
Will you upgrade the nether and end ?
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YeV1CS5zIsI
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YeV1CS5zIsI
wait, is the 1.19 out already?
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YeV1CS5zIsI
You're Builds are So Unique Keep up The Good Work Idol Trixy ❤️❤️❤️
BRO THIS IS GREAT AND EPIC! ! ! IT WAS LEGENDARY YOU STRIKE MY HEART WITH THIS CITY I HAVE NOT SEEN THE BEST IN MY LIFE KEEP GOING TO MAKE YOUR CONTENT I LIKE AND YOU ARE ONE OF THE BEST YOUTUBERS WHO DOES THIS. DUDE YOU ARE MORE THAN THE BEST, YOU ARE A LEGEND! ! ! ;)
We need some small caves in the usw
Comment for the algorithm!
Can u pls upgrade neither
whats the name of the song thta played at 9:09
Just wow
🔥🔥🔥🔥
The statues are so cool and the design are very creative. Each of them has a reason why it's standing there...
You should've added some dunes in the desert
Absolutely beautiful, but are you gonna go in later on and use the rest of the sculk blocks?
Why does this guy not 10mil subs yet,because that's what Trixy Blox deserves, he needs more subs for what he's doing
This is why I says that in minecraft we can build anything. And this build was amazing hats of to you 👏 👏👏.
Day 5 asking mushroom island
Please do some flying city
Please do an ocean video
I think im going to say it this is the best build yet
Can you make the same map but on bedrock?? So more people can play the map an watch your videos.
Thats so insane i say that everytime but HOLY SHIT
You probably have all of the biomes mapped out but I need to suggest this. There could be an ancient/ dead civilization underneath the mountains with a building style similar to the Isu structures in Assassin’s Creed. I guess that civilisation would’ve also been extremely advanced before they collapsed leaving their technology behind
Amazing as always, the only thing I would change were the tents in the caves, which weren't that good.
Beautiful!!!
I love to see that he is still posting vids
It's 100% worth waiting a month for a new video
Wait where is the portal thing from the ancient city ??
i love these videos. they are so cool
God I wish this guy worked for Mojang
you're different gravy...nah I mean DIFFERENT GRAVY!!!
Soo *epic*
wow amazing man
nice publicity implementation x)
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THESE!!!!
Pog
Loved this episode. Nice Job, so beautiful.
No-one is ready for this to be finished, it will be so emotional, the months journey, hopefully would be worth it in the end, hoprfully he's happy with something that we couldn't dream of, it took me a while to build a little house, this guys designed hundreds of thousands! This man, is the true solo builder, in my opinion atleast, love ya TrixyBlox, you're a legend, and I am not the only one who thinks that.
BEATIFULL
living there would be such a vibe
This one reminds me of the underground kingdom a bit :D great job as always Edit: welp you mentioned it and added the atlas statue from it lmao
My goodness what is this music 20:20?
Heyyoo, LOVE the USW series thank you!   I was looking over your list and realized you forgot to incorporate a biome. THE OCEAN BIOME! If its not to much to ask, is there going to be a ocean tribe of any sorts? Maybe Mermaids/Sirens involved?  Once again, You and Steph are doing amazing with the USW and cant wait for the rest!!!
Is there an end portal?
nice
is it possible to just buy the patreon once and still get all of the already existing projects or do you have to subscribe and pay every month? oh and wich patreon subscription level do you have to buy forthe USW?
This reminds me so much Erobor from LOTR- But it’s so different at the same time :0
Are you inspired by the book eragon for this because it really reminds me of jt
He should make snow place prison
When it comes out it will be super epicc!!!
One of the things I just realized is how useful horses will be on this map, usually I forgo them since theres so much wooded/mountainous areas but this has large flatish areas between POIs
I speculate that the guys in these caverns have something to do with the stronghold. The amethyst faction might be responsible for the end portal.
Will it be possible to get this for bedrock? Or will I have to go buy Java?
how to you build this stuff please teach me
I hope there is a diggy diggy hole easter egg xdd
YESSSS FINILY ANOTHER EPISODE ;)
Once this world comes out I’m buying it
I like your channel because you work so hard and support that😊
It is great but I can be better. I mean If U hired a peron ta make mod For U that would concetrate on adding those civilizations, this would be hilarious
I love ur builds and videos i think they are so cool
Great Video!
are you a designer ?
I don't understand any of the lore he said in this video.I can easily understand the lore he said in the last episodes but for some reason not this.Probably because my final exams are only 7 days apart.
How ar you so good in building in minecraft my minder is blowing🤯🤯🤯
How have Minecraft not hired you yet
Hello a fan forma Brazil here, your builds are awesome, can you make video of tutorials and tips
Now I know my place to get stuff :)
you are nothing short of a magnificent artist!
Could I play this on PE too?
Love the builds but will there be an underwater guardian temple?
Literally nobody: *The guy who has to refill the giant lanterns:*
I'm speechless
Download link:)
Война на Украине!!! 😫🇺🇦💣💥
Remember when he was at less than 900,000 subs they grow up so fast
imagine this guy on hermitcraft
Onother phenomenal build
Nice
This keeps getting more and more beautiful.
This world would be perfect for a modded multiplayer adventure! Love your videos
Too bad the dwarves went almost extinct after most of them starved to death
Are you okay Trixy? Dont get burned out over this holy moly
WHAT!?!?? you already hit 2.1 million subs!! i didnt notice grats bro.
I'm going to be happy when the Nether and end comes up
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
There should me viking villge
Every time he just get better! It’s not human, he’s something else entirely.
Are you going to make a specific plugin or a mod for this?
Im surprised his PC hasn't blown up yet.
Incredible work !!
Damn, one of the best builders ever. Love it and continue the work :)
This map makes me way more hyped than official Minecraft updates
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus
It's amazing
What you build is so incredible! Im so interested what you build in the Taiga biom
I love these videos, I know it will eventually end, but its kinda sad that's gonna happen. But I love it for what it is and enjoying everything you have created :)  Keep up the good work
I think it would be really cool if you used a datapack to add dwarves, and maybe other mobs too!
You are the best Minecraft builder I've seen in yt dude exceed my expectations everytime!!!
When I hear you explaining your builds at the beginning of the video I always think "There's no way he's gonna do this, it's way too ambitious"... yet you always deliver on your promise. What a madlad.
9:17 Am I the only one who thinks this look a bit of lonely mountain? And a bit how someone mede me think how those dwarf cities look in Eragon.
A giant mod pack with huge and hard bosses would make USW it's own game
HOLY FRENCH COURT THIS IS AWESOME
What about the sea or the sea tmeple biomes
this is building in minecraft in other level. nice talent
its lore is soo cool
Wish MC would use this map for future events, by far the most impressive map ever made.
The reinforced deepslate is a amongus meam and will not be in 1.19
so beautiful!🤩😲😃
its cool if you also transform the end and the nether:)
Epic & Cool
This looks awesome!
I wonder if there’ll be an underwater biome/upgrade? 🤔
Hi Trixy, u should also transform the end and the nether!! :)
The statues are absolutely epic.
holy crap this guy is talented
Would you think off adding redstone
I have every single dragon in dragon city
this man made zelda botw in minecraft
How big wasthe replay mod file for this video?
Imagine Mojang would hire builders and the 1.20 update would incorporate huge randomly-generated cities, dwarve-caves, dungeons with nice new loot etc.
is he doing the nether and end??
ah finally
L
You should make a texture pack that kinda get a vibe with the USW
Trixy if u can answer me I have some questions:   how long is it gonna take to finish this project?  Is this map going to be pay to play ( patreon ) forever or are u gonna make it free after some time?  Thats it.
Quick question will you be upgrading the ocean biome as well
Who else think blox should collab with @Sytemzee to make mods of different mob and other features
You should work at mojang 😂😂
I didn’t think it was possible, but this area is even cooler than the ones you built above ground. I’m in awe!
What about the nether and the end
🌯
CANT WAIT TO PLAY!! Your build are amaizing!!
I love it
Upgrade the nether pls pls.🙏🙏
Oh, this is a great video!
bruh the dwarves look so odiny. brilliant build shows a lot of commandingness i guess
Your world is so beautiful that I created my own plot for it, dark, mysterious, magical and mysterious... However, for the completeness of the plot in this world something is missing...  I presented the Forge of Kings in my story as a special tool, a gathering place for the Four Lords in order to forge another relic that will support their strength and allow them to do more good (my plot and the plot of @StephBlox are not related) There is a request: can I use the finished map in my videos when I create a series in Minecraft in Russian, while leaving a link to your channel and your girlfriend's channel?
I build a lush and gedod last week
woooow. AMAZING! You're better than Notch
wow thats crazy
mann it is really amazing how you build ( recommendation : you can add modded mobs so that it really feels awesome )
May next be taiga biome with after Mongolian Russian types of buildings. And there is an idea to make custom nether, if it is possible, and custom stronghold.
Just imagine of this world And turn into a 100 days of Origin mod
Bro how the f you doing this
It would be very cool if the music was in the map too.
I think it too much sculk
You are a genius
Piękna
Its beautiful😁
you are insane
the concept of the statue is cool but the placement is not good, for me.
I thought this world was free 07
This would be a nightmare to traverse if the Warden spawns here
Boring build tbh, to symmetric.
Production value just keeps going up and up, good shit man.
10/10 man to perfect
Since there are ruined portals in the survival world I would love to see some kind of improved nether fortress or some kind of ruined  nether kingdom.
You always out do yourself, can’t wait to see what you do next
I didn’t think it was possible, but this area is even cooler than the ones you built above ground. I’m in awe!
How is this Minecraft YouTuber able to create better world building then some of the crap I see on Netflix 🤨 Congratulations Trixy, you've got me more invested in watching USW then I am in watching a movie people paid money to see on the big screen
You should design the structures for minecraft.
WITH THIS WORLD
I WANNA PLAY ON A SERVER
You never fail to surprise me! This is amazing keep up the good work.
gib me download link now
You are very talented 😱
Can't wait to try this world out once it's finished
incredible work as always!
omg
Doesn't the Warden dig back down when it isn't active after 60 sec?
I love how it was all based on Erebor from the Hobbit which was one of your first builds on the channel
Reinforced deepslate is for portal u can find in game files a portal statue  and it looks like the reinforced deepslate thing  Edit: Just go watch @camman18 video
Your minecraft builds are so relaxing ❤️
This is so cool 😍 I especially am amazed by the statues of the founding factions
I'm always so excited to see these builds! It'd be great if the mobs received new skins according to their biomes to give the villagers particularly a bit more variety!
21:00 im sorry to tell you but the fram blocks are confirmed by minecraft developer among us meme
Amazing work, anyone else think he could destroy everyone in hypixel build battle
Although it's great, I know for a fact most people would use his builds for their own materials and uses. Basically taking the builds materials for their own benefits— such as builds, redstone systems and etc.
Are you upgrading the nether too?
The Copper and Amethyst factions are probably inspired by the ancient civilizations of Sparta and Athens
can tou do east asian country for the taiga biom
you should also upgrade the ocean monument for usw
OMG wow :()
Where is this guy's 3 million he's doing this for us
Are you going to transform the nether
It would be EPIC if you did the nether and, main end Biome
Did you say it's been TEN MONTHS?! Damn! It doesn't even feel that long!
Giant dwarf statue?
I'm always blown away, your imagination is off the hook!
Can you also ad elves/dark elves
mann think about making this whole map in survival
Mojang seriously needs to hire this guy
Make sure there was a mermaid city
Could you make a nether vulcano in the mountains and end islands at random spots above the world so they also get recognition?
Finnaly , some good content
and atlantis
could u build a elves kingdom?
Could you make gicantic ore veins with maps leading to them so mining is fun?
This is mindblowing, well fucking done. Get into some Web3 modeling ser and you gonna be immensely rich
Trixy why wont you apply dlto mojang builders hahahaha, that could be great and mojang added this USW world as tha main minecraft world generation.
Your builds are insane but its q shame they are hard to see
when will this release
you didnt even reach the like goal on your last vid, why are you making this
I'm so excited to play USW! Thoroughly enjoying the journey of watching it all come together
Love the content keep going!
The "mysterious stuctures" were an amongus meme LOL
I would love to see an Indian reference, you can maybe try and replicate an Indian temple :D  Love the map and the work that you do 👍
Were you ever thinking of making a mod for this map ? I mean it like making those civilizations population and something else
Am I the only one happy that it’s 22:00 long
This one is amazing. I kind of wish you did stormterror's lair from genshin impact
Will you be adding mobs???
Would be 100% more awesome if the game coding is   as cool as the builds
6:50 those who think that the statue looks like Thor from the Avenger holding Mjolnir and Strombreaker like
Is this only java? I am a bedrock player and this looks soooo cool!
Open a server when it’s done
Imagine if there were custom bosses which thrived in each land. The main four would be   "Auteleme (AU-TA-LE-MEH) Lord of the Lush"  "Phunra (FOON-RA) Lady of the Sands"  "Wolcabal (WOL-CA-BALL) Lord of the Mesa"  and "Mardenal (MOR-DEH-NALL) Lord of the Caves"  each boss would drop loot exclusive to them but specifically their "Sacred Emblems" which can be combined into an item which is key to solving the mysteries of the USW and whoever would possess this relic would unite the people and become the ruler of the USW
you should try adding mods (gobber, end remastered, ect). I think they might be useful for upgrading the nether and the end.
Imagine Black Plasma Studio used this map in their animations, it would be siiiick
I love how the original dark city is just a giant amogus meme
so no entrance?
*Waiting for other two dimensions*
So @TrixyBlox, do we have to pay to play on the usw? And like also wwowwowowwowwwowowow
Love it
Nice
Wow! You are really a genius. How about adding scandinavian /norse styled builds in tundra. that would be amazing!
Verbesserst du auch die Netherbiome und das Ende?
woah...
Honestly, at this point I think you should try and create a special mod for this world in order to make things even more alive! Great work, sure am going to get this once it's done
Is it posible to play the usw on bedrock??
Thank you so much that you spend sooooooo much time to make a cool survival world
Can't wait until I can download this!
Where do u enter the caves in the jungle mesa and desert
thats just an amogus meme
is there an elf in the map? I mean there is dearf now hehe
Is there going to be a custum stronghold
This getting real good! Can’t wait to play it soon with my friends!          If only I had a friend who played Minecraft…..
The map itself should be a game in its own!
Watching here from the Philippines!
Are you going to build something in Nether
Bro someone could tho a 100 days
69k Likes *Nice*
u are best
If this world is done do you have to play Many???
From the discord it sounded like you weren't going to update the world for 1.18, what an awesome surprise!  And I was literally planning a dwarf themed world to play on this map, now I'll have tons of inspiration!
The snowy mountains should be where the ancient frost Giants reside. Like their final resting place. It would also explain the LARGE skulls that keep appearing everywhere
Star wars more meme
lol usw in german is the same as etc
ay could u make hanging mountain village next?
How are you building so awesome how
Inter Biome Mining Network (IBMN)
I cant wait for the Usw, I love your builds, truly amazing.  I just hope you also transform the end and at least a small portion of the nether. But despite all that, I really love everything thus far, keep up the good work dude.
shut up no more ADs
You should ask someone to create a recource pack with custom mob models
Will there be nether upgradation too?
damn was excited to see a crazy lush caves :(
You need to add the ice and fire mod as a feature
Here at 69k likes
Nuclear station in Ukraine is being bombed right now by the russian army!!! This is the biggest disaster in the world BIGGER THAN CHERNOBYL!!! Please support peace in Ukraine!!! STOP PUTIN!!!
Building starts at 4:23 for anyone wondering
Honestly I don't know why some of you are not subscribed after watching this.
DO THE NEATHER DONT FORGET THE NEATHER
SO cool I wish i can build that detailed Builds that you made SUPER COOL
So cool
This project is honestly the best Minecraft project I’ve seen on YouTube ever. The amount of detail you are putting in to every little thing is amazing. I can’t wait till this project is finished because I would pay every penny to play in this or explore it myself
If there is a copper faction, will you add some craft with the copper ? Im french, i dont know if that's correct, sorry
Can happily say i've been here since around 400k subs. I remember once he liked my comment saying "this is not just a boy playing Minecraft. It's fucking architectural geniality!"
I really want to play your map as soon as possible, but I also want to give you as much time as possible to to make your builds as each one more amazing than the others
Wait, is the USW only for Java Edition? If so, then... Then... I might stop watching the series, why watch it when you can't even play it in the future? Welp, we gotta wait...
Soooo quic question and correct me if you have already done this but what about the neather?
Bro, you can build Westeros?
I'm just waiting for content creators to get their hands on the map to play an SMP
USW citizens: Great! Now we can mine lots of gemstones, metals and stone types. What are we going to do with it? Massive statues, obviously.
You should make a mod for this too
I feel like all this builds are way too good for Vanilla Minecraft!
This was a genuinely FANTASTIC suprise! I didn't expect a cave episode and even saw the teaser on discord going what in the world is that? MY GOD I AM SO READY TO PLAY THIS WITH THE FAM! Keep up the amazing work and you can be sure you have my sub to patreon once it's done maye
Is he planing to upgrade nether too?? 🤯 That would be insane ...
Imagine if he actually used mods 🤯🤯🤯
t
I've been waiting so long for a new video from you! Your buildings are REALLY IMPRESSIVE!
ametist roof was looking super good bro . why did you change it
finally after 1 month
OMG!!! I wasn't subscribed!! I've watched for ages and I swear I remember clicking it. Sorry trixy . Love the effort you put into your vids, keep it up
You maybe forgot 1 biome what is dat is birch forest
Idea, stone giant
Can you give me shader pack?
A Subnautica like base would be really cool to see as either a main building or a secret area for loot :3
I'm speechless. I was excited to see you tackle the lush cave, but was not expecting this. Amazing work my friend, I can't wait to explore this world when it's finished
We would like to a see a cyberpunk City map that would be so great
I've never understood how you manage to build such statues out of square blocks. My brain naturally breaks down every time I try to build something like this. There are no problems with everything else, but statues... This is my Achilles heel.
Quick question, does any one know where you spawn? I assume its on the middle of the island but i’m not sure 🤔
Nice
Petition for Bamboo Forest Upgrade!  You can do so many amazing designs and stories with Chinese traditional or mystical elements similar to the panda village in World of Warcraft
You should also make an episode with custom weapons and stuff
Hrm. Well then. I will die if this is not free. But if it is less than 10 dollars, insta buy.
Will there be a modpack to help tell a story that you would recommend to use when playing this map or will you have a custom mod pack that you feel would enhance the gameplay? I think the world in vanilla its self is something so insane and it will be grate to have that vanilla feel on such a cool map but I feel like some mods would really bloom with such a lore rich map. Please let me know if you are considering adding or suggesting mods or not ❤️
you should make a mod hwere you have jungle, dworfes , wolf tribes and the pharores insted of villagers
It,ll be cool if you could somehow make on one bedrock
Will this be available on mobile? :c
I wich i had Java 😤😤
I don't  know  why but i want technoblade  to do a series  in this world as i am big fan of minecraft  story mode
Just PHENOMENAL!!!!
Are you planning on recreating the nether and the end too?
the Founders statues are so freaking gorgeous that I feel like my head is going to explode. I can't wait to take in their grand splendor in "person" once the USW build is complete and the world download is made available. this project has had me excited since the start and every new video only adds to the hype !!
This would be beautiful even without shaders.
Been here since part 1, so happy how far this has been improved
From what he said at 14:00, I reckon the whole thing will be covered in bedrock except for a secret door you can find using hidden books.
a few hundred players should simulate civilizations on this map, good or bad idea?
You should upgrade the nether
I adore this series! I would love if after the usw is released you could add a video with all the Easter eggs and such for people like me who don't have an opportunity to play the game. 😁
this is awsoem but pls leave the among us referance out
This might be tmi but i love watching these videos high. Your voice is wonderfully relaxing to listen to and your build style is always a blessing to watch.
This is so amazing im- WOW You can build sooo good and the parts of this build mix so naturally together. I realy hope you can finish this and its incredeible when i think of all the time you spent on this. Respect
Why does the ancient cities remind me of The Ministry Of Magic from Harry Potter
The reinforced deepslate structure is just a among us troll...
How much will this build cost?
Don't forget strong hold
Will you do the nether after the overworld?
i am impressed
about how long to i can buy it
It’s kinda mad that this was a 1 mil subscriber special and now ur at 2 mil
Wow that's amazing, how long did it take you to make this, even up to the Minecraft update now, it's really awesome
pls also transform nether and end in this world
Breathtaking as usual, keep it up!!👌
🌟🌟😻🤩🤩
When you do the snowy mountains you should make the town inside the mountain.You could take inspiration from the elf build, but more like a Norse society.You could make a building where they take ice and snow and turn it into water for a farm.They have a bunch of leather armor, as that’s all that will warm them up.It can be attached to an underground port with Viking ships (this probably won’t get in, but still.)They won’t have very much metal as mountains don’t usually have much metal, so they will mainly have wooden and stone tools and houses.They will have an armory that doubles as a training center, as they are based off of Vikings.They will have a tree farm and stone mine to continue to build and replenish lost weapons (mainly axes.)They will naturally have a farm, as they have slim pickings in snowy mountains.They farm cows for leather and pork chop, horse for raiding and upon death more leather, and wheat for the cows and horses and the leftovers can be used for bread.They would need an enchanting room, as they only have leather and stone or wood tools.They might even have a mob grinder for potions to further increase they fighting style( this could model after berserker’s.)I’m not sure what kind of church it would be, but it at the center you could put a trident with channeling and loyalty three to simulate mjolnir and gungir combined (and even something similar to that with the sea temple.)You could put banner at the entrance to help keep in heat.You could put in a cooking room that doubles as a smelting room, because they would do so little with pipes going all over the place to transport heat.A library would be a nice place to enhance life, as they have been all over with stories about the other biomes.It would be easy to show how they disappeared.They could have been attacked by other civilizations, or got a plague or disease from them (they could have even gotten the curse from the jungle.)This forced them to leave after many died, with the remaining dying from the cold due to lack of supplies.I really hope you use this idea, but if you do you’ll probably have to cut a few things.
Breathtaking, I love it
How many GB Ram mobile is required to play this map without any lag
The main island reminds me of all the bionicle islands
i’m so excited for the snowy cold biomes!!! will there be one file or separate files for download on patreon?
literally all of this is amazing! lore-dope, building-doper. are you planning on changing the biomes of the nether as well?
You missed epic opportunity to make copper golem satue
Will this USW map is acceptavle for bedrock edition too? I mean will we able to play it from mobile? We are waiting for it to finish  and play but if it cost some money and dont allow mobile minecraft then I think we will continue with watching forever)
Tixyblox will you update the different vanila cave biomes? I know I would be a lot of work but it would be really cool!
this is an incredible build my favorite transformation you have done
I have a suggestion you should make an abandoned spider zombie and spider infested town in the spruce biome
if you have another village, you should do like a mission style building
Next on mountains You can add some sort of massive castle of ancient builders with village in it.
Damn, that was the craziest cave build I've ever seen. Imagine seing this on live action that would be very cool
Minecraft se queda completamente pequeño comparado con todo esto que estás haciendo. Felicitaciones 👏👏
Hey Trixy, can you play your maps on bedrock to?
Absolutely WOW! I cannot wait to play the USW I'm really looking forward to experience you're hard work.
Perfect 💕
looks amazingly good
I hope in this world that the nether and end will also get huge upgrades.
cant wait for it to come out. want to know if your doing the Nether
Carrying the Minecraft community like the atlas statue
I feel like there needs to be more diversity. Perhaps, a massive copper vein (which was added in 1.17, the second part of the Caves and Cliffs  update) on the Copper Faction's side. And, maybe a some sort of a massive amethyst geode hanging from the ceiling on the Amethyst Faction's side.
Omg I love this video
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeepic!
I am silent viewer btw your building its So amazing
Imagine this as an smp
You should revamp the nether and the end in this world
Reminder not to use "eskimo" in your next video as some find it offensive
You should build some drums, drums in the deep in there.
This would be like really fun in adventure mode
woww this is great. the connection between the diffrent biomes is like a doctor strange
What about the nether
Ive been waiting
Amethyst   -    Copper                     =    Athena     -   Sparta?
9:00 look in the water, the lava reflex faces and they look pretty cool
I feel bad for the older dwarves. The older you get, the more stairs you have to climb.
I thought I was good at building in Minecraft, but you‘re just on another level!! Massive cpngratulations to this amazing world!
Diggy. Diggy. Hole.
It's late right now where I am and I started dozing off in an attempt to finish this video, and had a dream where I shot a basketball hoop and I had just yeeted my phone. Also, this is really impressive; can't wait for the taiga and mountains!
Why does he not have eyelashes in 1 eye
1.20 is the covid update, completely irrelevant but i'd thought i'd tell you
The USW gives me some skyrim vibes
What a suprising treat!
I wanted to ask, that are normal caves also present on this island?
With the village in the cave not being exposed to sunlight, won’t the villagers die as soon as they are within simulation distance of the players because hostile mobs will will also spawn and not burn?
we need modernized civilizations outside the USW
That's sick
I think with some mod’s it’s much better
This is a man of focus, commitment, and sheer fckin will.  I would have given up in ep1 if i were him. The map was accidentally too big but he continued. I respect you
My man literally got no life
Does the nether have its own race of people?
damn bruh
I think I will die in that place.. Because you know I hate dark Cave and under world dungeon...😥😢😫
Ayyy
This is just incredible! The majestic gorgeous builds, the effort, the stories I can’t wait to hear!  This is Awesome!
this was quick
This is ansolutely unbelievable. Cant wait for 1.19! (And this of course)
The Thing in the deep dark is a troll from mojang they said that its an among us
The best USW episode
Amazing work man!!
I've been playing Minecraft for 11 years and this is the greatest project I've ever seen!
I'm Sorry But Just Saying that for poor gamer this world will be laggy lol (Sorry THo)
is there an "in-universe" name for this world?
I'll just wait for some YouTuber to play this cuz im 100% sure this will cause the destruction of my phone, can't wait to see the final ep of this seriesa dude
Will this eventually be free?
The USW is so huge. You have to make a mod with fast travel to make it even playable
Wow. Just wow. That is the coolest thing I've seen built in this world and that's saying something. This world is going to become the best one ever. This is amazing
ong i would slap so much mods especially the ones having to do with the mobs to make it way livelier
do women exist in this world? lmao what a boys' club
For your next project, that would be awesome if you made a map for the Origins mod!
Making things with just cubes is too difficult . Other than maths exam 🤣🤣
I love the dwarf kingdomI’m so happy you’re building one
Do you need to team up with an author to write a book about this.
Now this is some serious skill in pixel art 😎😎
holy, mad respect my man great video and great builds
You insane
bro 1.18.2 just came out 😭
What is the dwarfs made the foundation of the magical sword and the wizard just used a powerful enchantment on it.
Quick question.if your upgrading all of Minecraft does that include the nether,the end,and ocean monuments?
I think there needs to be a Defence system before entering the ancient city to stop people from waking the evil with in
How to double like a video??
My only gripe about this is that the vines could have a lil more cyan in them as a contrast but overall insane build trixyblox :]
whenever you do the nether, you should do a region that was inspired by the hell scape of the Doom games, like Kadingir Sanctum and the Necropolis.
let's take the moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into the  content for us..❤️🚀🚀👍
Are you going to update stuff like the nether and end? or just the overworld. Im honestly confused if your just updating one dimension for the USW...
I didn’t think it was possible, but this area is even cooler than the ones you built above ground. I’m in awe!
I loved the glow squids man. really ads to the life of it
I loved it!
love how the reinforced deepslate is just an amongus meme
You should make a reference to AOT that'd make the map look cool
Such a magnificence, subscribed this time
Remember guys, only 2 people are building this masterpiece.
Next snowy mountain
Anyone who steals the gems from the statues is a cruel and unfeeling monster. There is no debate on this.
Dang dude! You put so much work in to it!
you should take the hat off mate, you're sweating like a pig
Very nice work you are armesing one
Y’know, it would be crazy to play this in vr.
Very epic
Op man
Taiga next
Trixyblox really deserves respect. If you appreciate Minecraft and what you can do with it , you should subscribe..
the creativity and dedication on all of these videos is nothing short of astounding. i don't even play video games hardly at all but i'm looking forward to the release of this map so i can try it out!
Of all the people who say they are subscribed to not subscribed ratio you have the biggest Subscribed ratio White after you is fit MC
Do you have a Bedrock Version?
I wonder where the axolotls will appear in this massive world
Me and my 4 brothers mined out a new mountain from the update in survival and mined all the way to bed rock and built elabor with stone pickaxe,s over a few months nice to know people who commit there lives to minecraft as well
What shaders are you using?
love this series i can’t wait for it do release
AYOO
You have creativity something I don't have
what are the best mods fr this map?
Hidden feature idea: about 1 million blocks off the coastline make the world border like “the farlands” as a throwback and remembrance of how far Minecraft has really come
Huh, nice
See if i downloaded this world i wouldent want to destroy Any of it not even the grass bc it’s to beautiful
Honestly ever since 1.17 deepslate has become my favorite block in Minecraft. Especially the tiles.
I already know that I’m going to have to play on such a low render distance since this map is so big and awesome
So is this just a amazing showcase or is this actually going to be playable, and will this suppose to be a mod or rather a thing that can ONLY be played with mods? Still looks great!
Will naturally generated ores spawn beneath the surface of the USW
I think this is the best building in that word and your entire building so far
could I ask you for some tips on building
Final final USW map come wait this part very long time
Upgrade the sky next (Skyislands clouds etc)
I’d start playing games again just to play this
This is my favorite thing you’ve ever made.
Looks stunning. Keep it up!
Easily my favorite build yet!
Pls tell the ending song name  Your videos are amazing
Cant believe this project is almost a year old,great job m8
Letssgooooo
Do you have the nether and the end
Everything in this world looks amazing. I wouldn't want to break anything
hey will you replace the crimson wood with real skulk blocks when 1.19 comes out
im actually waiting for u to make ur own npc lols. ur god of our survival world. hope to see interesting npc
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
Let's give some respect to this guy creating these things for us and working for hours respect 🙏 👏
you know, once this World is completed, it would be amasing if they used the TTRPG mod (that's still in the works and probs won't be completed for awhile) to create a campagin on it  Like there is the main island that could have a fantastic story, but there is also the new generated land that could be considerd "the far lands" which would be an awesome expansion to it
GGs
Can u put it on the minecraft market place for free pretty please
Mojang why!?!?!
39%? People rare get 5%  Bruh anyways Minecraft build
Hey! Jesus loves you! God Bless! https://youtu.be/eqkOqz3vGyc
I didn’t think you would actually take my advice and do the mines of moriea
I love the clear implications those statues give regarding the dwarves and where they feel they lie in the hierarchy of things compared to the other tribes. 😂 Certainly not a meek and modest people. Also, shouldn’t the jungle tribe gate be the central gate, since they were the first to make contact with/be contacted by the dwarves?
Best video of 2022
Amazing builds and landed, I’m wondering if it has all the ores and stones underground for mining in survival, and if so are they distributed the same as standard Minecraft
Yo when you do the snowy mountain please play the lonely mountain song that would be awesome :D
Imagine Mojang hired him to build the structures and terrain in minecraft
Favorite upgrade so far hands down
I only have one questions: how does the baby dwarves lives? Obviously they cannot work tirelessly, they're babies, who takes care of them??
you guys should make a lore accurate usw mod/modpack
I have been waiting for this episode...
Unbelievable!
*I bet when you enter this cave you'll hear the boss music*
What about the ocean monument??????
You should add a ruined part of the city that was abandoned. This could be where the wardens are free and where they guard the prisoner that they keep. Cuz they’re called wardens for a reason
Can't wait till he makes a place for the elytra, I'm going there first to just get around the library in this huge cave!
NIDAVELLIR (from Avengers infinity war ) Minecraft edition... Must have include a star too...
That statue of the dwarf is the most badass thing ive ever seen in minecraft
Dude, your work is out of the world
Dragon city sponsored you two times i think
Truly insane
Who else is here for their Jeracraft fix?
It’s always important when representing other cultures to be careful about stereotypes and other issues. I think you have done a pretty good job at being respectful, but I would say that without the context, the wolf kinds statues might be misinterpreted due to the headdress. I don’t think you need to change, it is just worth being aware of it,
I genuinely heard the subscription rate go up and was pleasantly shocked! "Wow," I thought, "I'm glad others are subscribing too! I subscribed after the very first-" and then when I checked I literally wasn't subscribed 0_o Whelp, now I am lol! Just a PSA to check to see if you really are subscribed or not!
Just a suggestion but maybe you could add fast travel or something like that
Hey trixy after you finish this world you should make a animation of the whole world and maybe a mini movie?
Serious lots vibes
I can't wait to play this full map
You should create a Minecraft SMP with your fans and create a story/video based on our decisions.
The build is impressive and cool. I just feel like the deep dark city should have been more decrepid and broken. It feels a bit too alive and clean.
THE MOST AWAITED UPDATE VIDEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Ur hair looks very nice <3
Keep up the good work bro
You've gotta make an underwater section like Atlantis. It'd also be cool to see a nether section and an end section.
U DID ALL THAT IN ONE MONTH????? WHAT
i wish i could get a free download of world
Come on, netizens, let's increase likes so that the next episode will be uploaded soon!
bruh why you sped 100h on this buld
Hey trixy so the most commeted biomes will be the tiga and mountains I also am sure your seeing my commet as i noticed you used the idea i asked of So if so can you see this commet and give it a reply?  Anyway as for tiga i think you should do a viking theme Viking ships/cannoes or whatever they call them, loads of lumber piles, a few huts, a spiked wall like the wolf tribe, maybe a dungon with a drawf in it for some lore? And beef with the mountains biome  The moutain biome i feel should meet with what you think of if places like alska, green land ect. So large winter coats, igloo houses, powered snow traps for the Vikings that tresspass and plenty of healthy relationships and less known to the whole island that you have to find, maybe they are secluded most? And sense they are moutains use ice caves and ice spikes/spires for high ground and some scout towers and stuff Knowing you youll surpass all of these with soaring colors and crazy builds, both the tiga and snowy moutains are my fav biomes    (Dont forget a yeti in the snow caves/ ice tunnels for potental tresspassers)
Somehow, im still wondering where the wolf tribe got its name from, as the mesa and taiga are at almost opposite ends, and its the taiga where wolves are at their most common, so, maybe an in depth explanation to this in the next video. Besides this, the whole project is coming along nicely and i cant wait to see the finished product
39% subscribed Is actually pretty insanely good. Fantastic work with audience retention!
Hear me out you should add a giant gold storage kind of thing like what they have in the Kingdom of Erebor in The Hobbit movie
3:36 this is for skipping the sponsership
i hope i can get this on mobile!
You’re a legend man love the content please keep going
not to disturb you but what about the nether and end dimensions
Holy heck you mad man! great work
You should have made this the stronghold, do you already have a plan for that? But it was amazing
Looks like the best spot to live but mobs would be a pain in the ass
so the dwarves wield stormbreaker and mjolnir
Such Astounding build, just need fog effect to bring out the cave atmosphere.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH SO AWESOME I CAN"T WAIT TO PLAY ON IT!!!!!
Broo this is so crazzzyy
Will this be available on mobile
It's been a month?? Wow im getting old...
I kinda liked the amethyst roofs maybe add large banners with the 3 designed of the different cities
Love the hobbit themed deep dark!
This entire build reminds me of the hobbit, the gold smelting in a dwarvin place, Dwarves being underground , and dwarves being hated
I want to see the tiga and snowy peaks
I understand you probably didn't intend it this way, but can you see how it might be insensitive to have a group of POC kneeling before a white man? It looks like they're subservient to them. I understand this would take a while, but I would consider rebuilding that area because you're calling to mind some very unfortunate imagery.
That was worth my 20 minutes
Nexts upgrading Minecraft swamp biome 1.19 update
EYYYYYYY
wow
this is definitely my favorite episode of the series!
Been waiting for new update for a long time
I think that some one should make mods that go along with the story that will make it even better 😀
Legendary video, the story was so amazing, cannot wait until the next one
Watching this while eating was the best
Danggg
What about the nether and the end?
i would join your patrion  but im not paying that much!!
bro you gaining weight? hit the gym take care of yourself
this is truly amazing you should make like a heaven and hell theme for a different build???
Love the build and the lore you put into it. My favorite build was the statues of the founders, it seems your skills have grown since I first started watching you. However, I feel the use of the Warden does not fit with the spirit of mob. If your up for it I would suggest making another area that is just for the deep dark. This area would focus on the use of stealth and the Warden being an unstoppable force of nature rather than a creature to overcome once 1.19 fully comes out. Also I would love other builds that feature the different cave biomes cause while I do like your build it seemed too mashed together. They wouldn't have to have huge cities just other places to explore.
We need Costam mods just for this world it will be awesome to see Dwarves in the city and other npc and lore with mods that support the role play I really hope someone consider this
i swear thats not how lava loooks wait did you place own eacjh lava block! bruh this makes it a billion times better
Omg
once your done with this you got to make a world edit  tutorial
Would I be able to play this on my phone?? I don't have a gaming console or a computer but I would still love to play! Would I be able to?
I cant even make a house without it looking like a box
Coming from dragon quest builders, how much are your height limits and block limits? We can't fit any of your builds in that game but I like how the dragon quest builders blocks look better at their 128x128 pixel blocks instead of minecraft 16x16 and I made a texture pack myself to bring those block pictures into minecraft but only to 1.18 part a and need to see what else mojang added to the game and see what we have in dragon quest builders that can be used to make the blocks look less pixelly. So how do you make such large builds with millions of blocks so quickly when it takes so much time to mine each individual block and put all the new blocks in place? What is your ultimallet equivalent hammer to mine anything as is including plants?
Sheeesh
The last scenery are amazing it give me chil and super good builds
at this hes might as well build a planet
:]
can i have your shader pack pls i really want to see it
I have no words for this epic build!
Will this be available on bedrock edition
How to download
The is so amazing ✨😱😃your builds are so awesome
Cool
amazing
keep it up trixy
You make me jealous by how much you build
Love this
Man you are the best ! 3rd march is my birthday ! thx bro it would be great if i reach 250 subs before april !
You should have made a horror inspired dungeon maze for the warden, it would make the experience 100 times more terrifying.
Dude!!!! that looks awesome!!!!
That dwarf reminds me of Dmitri from MCU who lives in Nidavellir and forges the greatest weapons of all time in MCU including the infinity gauntlet
Its amazing! Amazing!
Its finally here!!! ... the AWAITED!!!  😎😎 Arival of a new episode 😭
Dude I've been watching this series ever since it came out and your doing amazing
Are you gonna upgrade the nether too?
He said that show your support by liking the video well I have been subscribed for so long lol and I commented also so😌😌😌
I love the theme of the entrances to each biome. But I think that the Jungle biome door should be swapped with the Sand door. Just to stick with the value the Jungle tribe had on the inter biome mining network. Just a thought it still all looks amazing so keep up the great work Trixy.
I can't wait for this to be done
When the DSW is done will people be able to play in the DSW?
all i can say is wow.
I wish I was this good at building, keep doing what your doing you bloody legend. Best wishes from Canada
Theres no birch biome tho...
Will you do it with the nether and the end ?  this map will be very nice
After all of these magnificent builds, something popped in my mind. Will you upgrade the netherworld also? 🤔
trixy for the next video why don’t you add vikings in the snowy mountains?
maybe u could combine looms in the deepdark library to indicate that some are stolen BEFORE they discover how to protec themselves from above ground people
A Nepal/Himalayas themed mountain biome would be so cool!
Right now Russian tanks are firing at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Watch online: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYUT36YGOh8
Will this be avaible to donwload on mobile
This is so fricking awsome
Have I ever said how insane this is? Because it's absolutely insane how much work is put into this world to receive that outcome. I am stunned each time. Every time I think, well he can't improve this game any more, I am pleasantly surprised at being corrected.
AAAAAAHHHHHHH bro, this is possibly my favorite episode! I'm totaly gonna buy this!
Nobody:               Me: *I am a dwarf and Im digging hole*
For the new islands nearby the USW island, imagine if trixy did a DLC! It could be something like the hidden red stone engineers too advanced for humanity or even the “Garden” a place with incredible resources and loot but an evil lurks underneath its surface
trixy pls shout out but your builds are sick
A giant dwarf statue. PERFECT!
Couldn’t wait for this😁
Wow. You've really outdone yourself on this biome!
this update was far too copy and paste for me, personally. however, still enjoyed it!!
i can tell this episode particularly took a lot of effort, it's 10000% paying itself off 👍👍well done
Hi there I LOVE all of your vids!!!  Here is a idea for the mountains biome you could put Mount Everest and use nepal culture for that biome just and idea but can’t wait to see what you do!!!
Nice
UNI
This is AMAZING! are you thinking about doing the nether as well?
I still find it crazy that he is able to make cubes into something so magical and magnificent!
so that's the trading hub basically
He probably had to shear each and every one of those vines. Respect.
Where swamp tho
Nice
Im glad he’s going all out. He’s bringing Elden Ring to Minecraft
Alright. You win! Take my money!
Are you doing the nether
hey Trixy! i want to suggest to upgrade the nether and the end too. i think it would be realy cool. this is awsome! i know how tideus it can get, but it's really nice what you have done from scratch. keep it up!
i'm not going to lie yall should make this ultimate survival world a server so multiple people could play with you guys and make this map come alive
what about bedrock?
I kinda want trixy to join hermitcraft or smth
This. Is. Awesome.
I think he should update the mobs
I loved it but you forgot to add a area for the axolotls because axolotls live in lush caves
Now I’d like to consider myself a good builder but…  Jesus.
Does the USW have any matriarchies? This series is so cool, I think it would be cool diversity. If there is already one, I’m sorry! Either was this is so impressive.
Have you thought about tackling the nether? It can be a place where the ancestors reign after their death in the overworld and it's where they look over their people
You should make a weapon mod
Damn goodluck on that
cannot wait to see someone playing on this map🤩🤩
Holding out for that ancient Roman architecture somewhere!
Hey! Probably an idea never to happen in this scince it's a survival word with no mods, but it would be really cool if there were grappling hooks, working so they would launch you forward.
MY DUDEEEE!! YOU MAKE SUCH GREAT VIDEOS! You’re amazing!
What about the nether
Ohhhmazing lol. Sadly I don't Watch her series I don't want no spoilers 😆
this is all really amazing but I think that the dwarven city could use a huge palace at the back of the cave to fill out that section of the cave because all the other sections are completely filled out and the back not being filled out makes it stick out a little to much. Of course this palace would have to be built and designed around the statues, lava channels, and minecart system
@TrixyBlox since u have added a dwarves faction that is technically a race from the midworld are u going to add different races as well?
Truly stunning. If only minecraft was like this all the time😆
This episode was so amazing!!!!!!!
I don't know if you guys plan to build anything in the taiga but can you build like some kind of cabin village with woodcutters?
I can't believe how hard you work on your builds. This is a masterpiece
Just incredible
Amazing as always
FOR ROCK AND STONE
Make a viking village
this is the definition of dedication
Will there be a way to get this on Xbox?
Trixy blocks i would like it if you add some costome weapons and mod in it so there could be more adventures
When this is done, will the players be able to get everything they need from loot etc, or will they need to play normal survival minecraft as well?
Make a undertail reference in the mountains like snowdin
Why the head dress. Why.
This would make one epic server
my mans literally incorporating segregation into his dwarven factions.
I am pretty sure this is at least a little bit inspired by the hobbit right? The conveyer belt, the statues  the endless supply of gold and gold pouring down into the furnaces yep yep
"Gold tools are powerful"  -TrixyBlox
All I could think ....holy shit
The legend is back
Do The nether
Yeeeeeeeessss
This should be a movie
I am 100% joining the paytreon just for this!!
bravo! :)
Omg this is epic! Your builds just keep on blowing my mind!
For snowy mountains I would say a norse theme for them would be very cool
Fortnite
Awesome! So cool
Man, look where Minecraft is now  Back then, we're just making Aether portals, trying to summon Herobrine, Watching minecraft monster school  Good ol' times
This is so fkin cool
Bruh man  is
Saya sangat suka permainan minecraft ini ia sangat menakjubkan dan menghibur membuat anda rasa gembira 🤗
best part : statue at the beginning lol
I cant wait to build my dirt hut starter home in this world!
British
for any snow biome, can you make it russion themed? it would be fitting
Its bittersweet knowing by the time your done the map will already be updated into oblivion
Imagine this AMAZING map on a Public Minecraft SMP!
Your best upgrade yet
I wouldn't be suprised if you joined Hermitcraft
would love to see someone do an overhaul of this USW with the Create Mod
I dream one day  to build as good as u
This is amazing!! Serious dedication my man
The lava coming down from the Dwarven King's Hammer being off centered doesn't sit right with me. Made it look a lil wonky IMO. But everything else looked absolutely amazing
brooo idk why but this gives me god of war vibes
That man needs actually more attention for what he’s doing
Will this be on mobile
Won’t the warden just dig down/despawn and escape
please do the dimensions!
I don't know how it's possible but your builds get better with each video. This was a stunning build and I am really looking forward to exploring it for myself
Trixy can i ask some questions? for the way you said that we are not able to dig straight down onto the deep dark, did you mean you made something out of blocks or redstone to stop it or will you use commands, if you do use commands, imagine stumbling across the command room
Prettty cool 😎🤪🥴😂🤔🤩🥶😱🤤😳👍🧘‍♂️💃
Idea : Abandoned castle in snow place
Drip Leaf Obstacle Course!
How do I join the smp
i thought it was not a dwarf statue and the statue holding a mjolnir, also the dwarf look like viking too
This map should be a separate game by itself
This mans pockets are going to burst when the map is out. For real.
2:28 i am a player and i am nearly lvl 20
what an amazing build
I'm a minor, so I can't really join your patreon; I still try to support you by turning off AdBlock. I hope this world doesn't end up patreon only, although if it does, I will still try to support you as best as I can
Absolutely amazing! I’ve loved seeing all these videos and can’t wait to play this world!! This cave kingdom so far is my favorite. Only thing I don’t like is that the lava source is off center which bothers my OCD but other than that it’s amazing!
How the heck u do this. Seriously do you even go thru one hour of this! Hopefully u get the most support for this project
Let's gooooooooooo
Will this be playable on bedrock Xbox?
youre amazing dude jeez
does this work on realms?
TrixyBlox the story of the wolf tribe is cool. But you said the native people-the wolf tribe of the mesa ones lived in mud and stone homes. Homes like that gust can't go away so were are they?  Are they are some ruins in the mesa mountains come on you can't say that doesn't sounds cool.
I am curious of how you will upgrade the ancient city
One of my favourite ongoing series for Minecraft on YouTube ATM, love it ❤️
please upgrade the end and nether too!
Mojang needs to hire this man to make their structures
Donate your merch to Mr. Beast philanthropy
World download? Plz
THIS LOOKS SO DOPE! Awesome build once again :) You never fail to amaze me!
I found this series yesterday and watched all of it. Now, only a day later, there's another episode! I remember seeing someone say something about customizing caves on one of the other episodes, cool to know you did it! I haven't watched the episode yet, but judging by the previous ones, it's going to be beautiful!
I cannot wait to go through this world in vr
you couldve used looms to make empty looking bookshelves. Beyond that though, It's all incredible. I mean, the bookshelves are still incredible, but I feel like they could be even better
Ngl I would pay any price for this world and Ari have been following you ever since you posted the first ultimate survival world vid
mans is goated
This could be something straight up out of Dark Souls
Its every thing so amazing, cant wait for this to be out to play
I made a new account but have been watching this from the very beggining🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I am taking a multiple month long hiatus from Minecraft after burning out on an anarchy server I lost everything in, but you can bet that the moment this drops I will be returning to run a survival world here! Keep up the great work!
Will u do end and nether?
My favorite part was defiantly the statues. I love the build as always and would love to see more
Ooh you should build something in the nether too maybe
This looks straight out of the Lonely Mountain's forges, at Smaug's Desolation.
Wow this is one of the coolest ones yet!
i want to play on this map so bad
I really liked how you added Dwarves at the end when you were showing it off
Who wants grian to be a builder of this masterpiece?
7hrs ago OwO
with how magnificent this map get every time I sincerely hope it will be available for 1.16.5 users, it would be a shame if not
The amount of work you do to bring us this amazing one of a kind content is amazing! Thank you!
You NEED to do some Elden Ring inspired builds, like imagine the capital city or the erdtree In minecraft 😍
Dude this is EPIC!!! I can't wait to play in this some day!
Verrrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Talks way too much, shows too little
so are you doing ocean stuff? Also are you gonna add the new mangrove tree from 1.19?
Hey Trixy! I was wondering would you ever do the end or nether?
this is the coolest mincraft build i have ever seen can't wait intill you finish it.
I request a volcano in snow biome
the wardens will definitely make a great "warden" for the dwarves treasure but I do feel like that having to fight them is kidna impossible, they have twice the health of the wither and can 2 shot someone in protection 4 full netherite armor
Can you make the download for the world for  PlayStation
Can you make this for bedrock?
It souds better as copper clan and amethyst clan
Add a mod specifically for this map find someone to help you
Can the shaders and resource packs ur using be included in the world download at the end
okay but can we get someone to update this world with tinkers construct elements?? that forge would be sick as fuck with tinkers construct fr fr
Love your builds! You truly are a talent and I appreciate your hard work and creative ideas (Steph as well) this is by far my favorite!
if you make a mod it can even be better
why not sponsor DragonVale??
A minecraft developer said that the big portal like structure in the middle of the deep dark city, is actually an amongus meme lol
Soooo amazing as always
Can you please do the 3 illager factions (pillagers, vindicators, and evokers) please I want to see an abandoned village that was destroyed in the first raid of the USW.
Grian who your builds are amazing and honestly props to you love your channel please keep It up.   P.S I like Grian too he is amazing I was joking they are both amazing builders.
I cannot say enough how much I love the detailing in the arches, floors, walls, everywhere! It literally made me gasp. I want to steal your skills so badly you don't even know lol (Also watching these videos motivates me to keep working on my own big projects! UGH I love your stuff!)
I love every thing about this
I hope there will be costom friendly mobs for the areas
Noooooooooo 😢
I loved the amethyst roofs
I have an idea, when he mentions that in the past of USW history, there were primeval creatures and beasts inhabiting the island. What if there are those beasts were inhabiting the lands beyond the great seas. Like when you go to explore, you might encounter those creatures.
Did someone say free builds?
https://youtu.be/ytWz0qVvBZ0
This has to by by far the best build in the USW yet, and thats saying something! This is also one of the first places a player would want to go to in the beginning!
Jesus Christ saves from sin. Romans 3: 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Hebrews 9: 27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Isaiah 64: 6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. Revelation 21: 8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.  Romans 5: 8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. John 3: 16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 14: 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  Romans 10: 9-10.  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Jesus said John 5: 24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.  1John 5: 10-13 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God..  Ephesians 2: 8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Romans 8: 1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 1 Corinthians 15: 3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 2 Corinthians 5: 21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.................................
Id love to see someone make a mod that placed actual NPCs in the world
i am so excited for the world to come out
absolutely incredible work as always, I'm stunned by the amount of work you get done in each episode. Are you planning on also altering the nether and end?
It would be cool if you collaborated with some redstone YouTubers and made a redstone area, or upgrade the existing areas with working doors and traps
This keeps getting more and more beautiful. Can't want for the next update!
For one of the islands, I'd like to recommend karst topography/cockpit regions.
I just wanted this and I’m in love with the build l, I am obsessed with the hobbit so I just love the building’s, the gold system, the music just everything, you’re doing a great work can’t wait for the next one!
I just knew that there had to be some Hobbit inspired features in this build
What about the nether
if this was made into an mmorpg server you could play that would so be dope asf
I love these videos, I think it would be really cool, if there was like a “Lost Kingdom” where bunch of animals would live, seeking to escape from extinction, Idk, just a suggestion.
You're a beast builds is amazing and you spend so much for this series Salute for you! I really like you're builds.
"Impressive... obi wan has taught you well..." - Darth Vader
I wish I could play this but I’m completely broke
I hope someone makes a modded dlc after this drops
Upgrading the nether 💀
Wow! This is amazing! I have a suggestion Maybe you could build a black market in the caves where the bandits trade with and sell with others
Yo
This guy should be part of mojang company
I am a dwarf and im digging a hole.
im just going to start off with wow... these builds are all fantastic! the caves are everything they needed to be and more. great job! but i am wondering if hes going to tackle the nether or the end. and with the mention of far off islands will there be surprises on them as well?
The first 4 minutes are worthless; skip them.
Dragon Kingdom in the snowy mountains please
Among us crafter
The island is sus
gosh i've been waiting for so long :))
WWO HE'S UPDATING THE CAVES TOO!?!?!?!! Cool!
those statues you added are super sick!
LETS GOOOOOOOO9
You should create a giant azalea tree!
Me gonna buy this also Im on mobile world import....... CRASH
You could add some redstone to your builds to improve it :))
Bro… unbelievable
This is absolutly crazy, I can only wait until I can play this for myself! As a side note, wouldn't this be cool as a server? Like how hypixel skyblock is but with more lore...
is this downloadable on bedrock ?
when ur don’t you should do a plauthougj
bro this goes so hard. amazing vibes for sure
noice
you def deserve to be on trending, your buildings are crazy
I really love this series! And I know that it’s probably a lot to ask but it would be cool to see this adapt with the new stuff coming with the swamp biome revamp and the dark caves/ancient city’s!
Warden will be the newest mob!  Allay:AM i a joke to you?
I like this builds and the story but still how are they travelling 16 million blocks? A gate way, a teleport stone something like that?? It would be better if we know how  they travel such a long places to do tradings or adventuring.
Bro just saying when you release this everyone will have the best experience of their new minecraft adventure, im so hyped
I really hope you include the nether biomes, and end cities.
can you add a Minecraft dungeons mod
You should transform the main end island
Favourite part was the 4 statues. You are truly insane holy moly. You're amazing. And by you. I mean a of you working on this project
you should transform the nether after this USW
When one is a Gamer, they can live a 1,000 life's.
Wow this is awesome! Keep up the great work ❤
The release of the USW comes before my parents wedding in most impotence
ONE PIECE FANS: THAT'S WANO COUNTRY
I just realized that's want your done with this big world how are you going to make the biome civilization more realistic like are you going to make a mod for the NPC in the biomes or something
this guys insane
So would the main island have natural or anf caves?
:)
You inspired me to build but I don't build on this scail (yet)
no lie the music at the end kinda reminds me of hhtyd in certain parts
I am so excited to play this in vr!!! It will be soooo cool, it I so amazing, great work!!!
Eppppiccc
Trixy is like equal but different
Amazing bro which mode is this
Honestly all that is such good material for a full scale RPG game
every single time i think "oh he could put something there" during the timelapse, something gets put down in that spot. Absolutely incredible! the painstaking effort and attention to detail really shows
Holy shit
You should turn it into a data pack :)))
Like I get you want subs but like when you got over 2M. You got stop using percentages…. Like sure your 39 is over 1M for crying out loud…. Come on dude
I truly can't believe your dedication in making these videos with good content for us. Keep going you are awesome!✨
WOAH, THE STATUES LOOK SO COOL :0
Hope the makes in on the Minecraft Marketplace!
If this wasn't edited, this video would be so long  Seriously lets take a moment to realize how long these builds take
Very nice job keep it up 💪🏻
nether?
When your parents say that games are bad for you but then you come up with this:
The dwarf statue was INSANE and the banner designs for the amethyst and copper factions were really cool too! Keep up the good work!
Can you play this on mobile
I have a question. Don't wardens crawl back into the ground after a while? Is there a way you prevented this?
I don't think Trixy will answer me, so I'll ask to you all guys. How much do you think we'll have to wait for the final release?
A cool idea would be to have plugins available for the map to have certain villagers with quests and dialog
and nice story about this
Cool!
I think we all know what the dwarfs will sing as they mine.
i am a cooper little fighter
Looks amazing like always! Keep up the work cant w8 till the end project!
Absolutely incredible keep it up!
What about the ocean monument?? Don’t forget about that.
will you be changing old builds with the new blocks from 1.19?
Awesome! I really hope we can have this map on PE...
wold it not be awseome if mat pat did a theory on this map
Mojang really should hire you for making something like a new and improved Minecraft Story Mode. Both the world and the story you've created with it are incredible.
I wish you can also include the stronghold and upgrade it
"We thought this was an epic way to incorporate the Wardens into this transformation , giving you guys mini bosses to tackle in your adventures"  For a start, I am absolutely loving this series... But no... Just no... Wardens my friend are by no means mini bosses.... They are literally the strongest mob in the entire game, they are pure and simple just Bosses.... And are frankly terrifying to come across...
this man be taking the term world building to a whole nother level
The snowy biome should be a mix of erebor and Moria the lost kingdom of the dwarves before going underground inside the mouth ants in the snowy biome
Add a skulk shrieker so the warden will spawn because the warden will be despawn by itself if you are not spotted for a long time.
Imagine how many creepers spawn in the cave and blow it all up.
Are you gonna be doing anything for the Nether in the USW?
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯👏👏👏👏👏
sheeesh
are you going to do the nether and end aswell?
dasdass
incredible amazing best transformation Yet!!!   (c;
New episode let’s go
Bro soooooo insane !!!!!
And I play on PlayStation
I play Bed rock but will I still be able to Play the USW
This whole map would be amazing for some kind of Dungeons And Dragons
I like the vid before I watch the video I already know it’s finna be sum good
literal goosebumps
honestly, your creations are amazing and the music you added really fits. Man, it even adds nostalgic vibe
I have a feeling you're not going to leave nether without an any update
I have to ask, am i the only one that really wants to see an abandoned version of this underground city?
Can you release your creation on Minecraft I really want to play it please make it done tell mojang to upload your adventure pack by trixyblox
i had a seizure when i was eating KFC and saw your video, finnaly a good video while eating
Ok👌 this is some beautiful building, you never fail to dissapoint me and ive learned a lot about buildig from watching your content
With every new episode I get more exited for this adventure. But latley I want to read a fantasy book about this amazing and magical world. It would fit this whole project so good!!
People that won't be able to play this cause they have a trash computer say "I" *I*
Dude…. This is frickin SICK
looks great, except for the fact that you'll have to replace the skulk blocks once 1.19 comes out.  And you should have the warden be friends with the dwarves, and add skulk screechers and stuff. So there's stealth :)
How? You truly have a building talent
You can say the jungle King BRIDGED the connections
Don't forget the nether and end. I would love to see you do those too
If I were you, once the world is finished, I'd put it on the marketplace for players on Bedrock Edition
Omg! This was amazing. Like what the heck, you are so talented man. I hope you know that there are only some people in the world that have the dedication and love towards big projects like this and you are one of them. Everything you create is stunning and I can see how much time and effort you put into each build.
Babe wake up, new USW video dropped
Are you going to add custom interactable NPCs to tell the story as you play?
I want to see someone recreate the entire USW using the create mod
you are the greatest Minecraft builder I know, Minecraft should be employing you to build things in their trailers. great work and amazing video.
Can you make the emerald block a little more visible? (7:42)
I love this guys builds, i wish I had half the talent of him.
It would be awesome if this survival world would be available for bedrock edition players also
Hi TrixyBlox! I was wondering if you could upload the USW to Mcaddons or Minecraft marketplace! Thank you!
I wish I had 1 percent of the patience you do
that would be a wild game of hide and seek
This guy is a legend
Maybe you can make your own biome related villagers in a mod createter
we need a upgraded stronghold
what the HECK HOW IS THIS SO COOOOOL. I can't wait for when the map is done
You aren't human.
Just too good of a builder.
Maybe you can do a Ocean city and a sky city
Will this be on the console marketplace. I believe that U should get together with Microsoft and put it up there considering that this is a seriously popular series where millions of people are watching. It would be a shame if this isn't on console
Is this a tad unbalanced
Someone give this guy and his gf awards for creating one of the most detailed and massive mega builds of all time and doing it completely by themselves
This is literally the coolest thing man. Hope it can get released on the xbox marketplace! I would literally pay like $100 to experience this world
Waiting for the download of the map
When you don’t have Java
This is great and I love it. Unfortunately my brain doesn't like the fact that the lava from the dwarf statue is off center. However I'm not saying it is bad as it is one minor detail in an otherwise perfectly built... build.
Where to install the map
This series is getting along so well! Can't wait to be able to play it :P
I love your videos
dang minecraft needs to hire this guy
Will this be available on pocket edition
amazing
I honestly can’t wait to give you my money so I can play this, hurry up please 😂 Nah seriously this is straight up incredible
still awesome
I want to download your world
Is it just me who noticed this, but am I the only one that sees that the dwarf statue’s axe kinda looks like the dwarven axe in Skyrim?
will the usw map be paid like a patreon thing?
my favorite part so far, along with the jungle
Well if we have Dwarves, we do need elves.... maybe 2 races, 1 in the jungle the other in the tundra. Jungle: Silvan, Tundra: Moon
Will you update the nether and end
Is this elden ring?
grian, Master of Building TrixyBlox, King of Building
Will we be able to play this on a console?
My mind is blown. I can't imagine how you're generating this much amazing content so quickly. My favorite part is your scripting, I think it helps me really appreciate the builds.
will you make weapons for each group?
As somebody who absolutely adores Dwarven architecture and caving in minecraft you somehow managed to merge both together in perfect harmony. Also using Erebor as a reference was a fantastic choice as it's an amazing area. A big thanks to you and Steph for creating this honestly staggering and absolutely gorgeous survival world. I'm enjoying the hell out of both the building and the story videos about the world and can't wait to see what's coming next
Anyone else really wondering how he got those shots with the warden? (He said it’s a datapack, but I’m still confused on how can a datapack add that)
Yoooo a socialist dwarven society thats so cool
Impressful
this build by itself was just as crazy as the underground kingdom in my opinion
Is it possible to play this on a phone or Nintendo when this comes out?
I have such a good idea for the snow mountains… you should create a huge ice cavern with a lost tribe which was abandoned by the rest of the tribes and left to freeze in the snow mountains but instead they created there own strong tribe which is ready for revenge…
I just want you to know that i was in that 39% subscribers❤❤
Now do the same in survival lol
Can we download your amazing builds i subbed
At this point these videos get a thumbs up before I even watch. Regardless of whether you like the design or video, the amount of time going in is insane.
realllyyyyy wished you would've made the copper factions roof copper :/
it would be cool if there were windcraft elements like magic and stuff i know you prob can't do that but that would be cool
LETS GOOOOO
Mans just made the fortnite map in minecraft
ie been waiting since the first epesode and i just want to say that it was worth it i loe your content keep it up and cant wait untill the next part
Will you put it on the marketplace on bedrock edition
You and your team are just amazing
This is indeed, insane.
Are you gonna add the deep dark portal thing?
I'm going to buy Minecraft again just for this
🤠👍🏿
Wauw :o
I’m so fucking excited for this.
You and grian should work together I mean both of you guys are great builders. Who wouldn’t wanna see a collab?
do have a backup copy of these world you know just incase you accidentally delete it
If only you could have added Create mod to this world, it is sadly not on 1.19 tho...
Will you transform the nether too?
this is so cool and probably takes soooooo long. are you gonna transform the end or nether?
Holy crap how do you even do this??? Like is the amount of talent this takes even legal??
Any programmers tryna make the Ultimate Mod?
Id love to see a swamp Biom in the world
im early..ye
Wow. That was amazing! And the final shot of the entire build was jaw dropping!
I think you should get someone that is experience with the create mod so instead of having to imagine giant doors with giant gears opening and closing doors why not just do it with create I'm having the vats be filled with rava and then have them tilt over and drop the lava into another area or having canals that raise and lower water levels maybe get mods that actually add boats so when you're playing you can build your own giant boat and sail to the other outside land to bring back your treasures back to your Homeland aka the Giant 16 million block Island p.s. you could also add draw Bridges
No way that its already TEN MONTHS 😳😳😳😱😱😱 it felt like you made it in maybe idk 2 months. I still remember how i was impressed with the first video of USW. I gotta say this, you did a great job dude. Its amazing.❤❤❤
oh my god, you outdit yourself with this one!!!! Every video makes me more and more hype for the release of the USW map, and i think by the end  i might just bust through the ceiling in excitement * the cohesiveness of the whole city is a-ma-zing, with how you used the minerals AND lights sources to make everything bright in spite of being underground. the minecarts system is by far gonna be my favorite part to play around with
when this comes out is it going to be free
This is so beautiful it doesnt look like minecraft anymore as the levelnofndetail and scale is off the charts. Just wow. I wonder how it all looks without fancy shaders, probably still epic but I'd be interested to know.
Really amazing build!
You should add copper veins to the wall
I really wanted to see the snow biomes first but this build has really impressed me, it’s amazing
I absolutely love this, almost surreal, underground dark city theme that u got going on here, amazing job man!
You're a god at building
this is crazy good.
make a temple or castle in the mountains, and make sure you add a penis easter egg in the ceiling of it
amogus island
LIKE IC YOURE WATCHING IN 2024
Giant dwarf?!?!?!
It looks really cool
Your builds are so detailed keep up this amazing work.
You just never disappoint, do you?
You should upgrade the end and the nether....
Looking forward to exploring this!   I can't wait to own it myself.  Great work!
It is a beautiful build but what could be cool yo explore it is adding npc where you can accept quest from.
The warden may break blocks to avoid players cheesing the fight so what if they get triggered by the skulk sensors and break out?
To bad the reiforced deepslate was an among us meme.
How do u still look healthy after putting this much time into a game😂
Trolls for mountains
Can this world be played in 1.16 which is my favorite version and the only one I play?
You should make the mountains have a big castle
This may be incredibly difficult or even impossible, but for finalising this minecraft survival world, you absolutely NEED to give it soundtracks, like when you enter this cave an intense but yet nostalgic-feel song would come on, etc. It would really make this world so much better..
Insanity! I'm insanely impressed!! 👏👏👏
Will it be available on bedrock edition?
Imagine all the mobs that will spawn here..
u have the imagination of an entire production team.
Question, how do you place glowberry vines and keep them at the length you want? They keep growing for me.
What shaders do you use?
The reflection in his eyes looking like my pfp
Is it going to be mod friendly?
ughh!! i cant wait for the snowy biomes! i love snowy stuffs😆
Can u make ultimate dugeon
Nice caves dude.
What shader do you use
This is amazing!
Are you gonna be doing the End and the Nether?
Damn, its truly insane
This has some kind of modlist for playing with? it really looks awesome and it would be amazing playing it with mods that add the civilizations or simply complement the gameplay
Are you planning on upgrading the end and the nether?
Today episode was really freaking beautiful
Him factions Me a reader 😏
I was kinda hoping for a different approach on the deep dark lore. It's too mysterious just for it to be:  "How cute, a warden! Let's kidnap it without the deep dark ever going against us!"
I hope that he add mods to this world
What about the end and nether?
That is going to be nearly impossible to invade… then I found their greatest weakness. Their greatest weakness? Let me explain how to invade this system: First of course to break the very clearly there spell shield of some sort surrounding the outer dome of the cave or invade through two doors simultaneously. The doors will be more costly but would be the better option for a many kinds of armies. Then seal the other door. Next step is to do daring raid on the forge capture it for a moment, then break the bridges leading to the living sections and burn all water transportation of the entire cave. Then do about a 3 year (at most) siege allowing no food to the living parts while also blowing heavy amounts of smoke into the sections (since it is a cave, there is no where for the smoke to go but stay there.). This will be a very costly war.  Do not destroy everything, that will cause problems with the enemy you don’t want.  The largest problem you will face will be the wardens, but lots of smoke and fire will keep them away.
does anyone know what shaders he uses? theyre really cool and i wanna try them out
Umm, could you add some indian mythological structures in some biome? The designs are actually awesome
This series is so epic
Amazing as always
Hi, can you make the snowy biome Buddhist or Hindu? I would like Asian representation in the build ty! 😀
Every time I think this series can’t get better, I’m proven wrong. This is hands down your best work yet. Are you going to include the Nether and the End Dimensions in your upgrade? If so, I’d love to see your take on the building styles and lore of the Fortresses and Bastions.
These builds are why I subscribed and all the nice details in the builds
Hell nah This has been going for ten months
In the tiga biome you should build a tree house village you know because the trees are so big (this is just an idea btw you don't have to do it)
It's awesome it's like a Minecraft  movie but with mysteries, adventures and historical features keep up with the vids👍😎
The amount of effort put into these videos is out of this world
Are yu gonna be doing anything to the water biome between the desert - jungle and behind the witch island? Like a mini atlantis build, a small ancient ruins or even a giant crater like Dean's blue hole found in the bahamas? Ik yu've done the atlantis idea before and may find it gratuitous, thus a temple or monument isn't needed. But it would be otherworldly if there was a giant trench or hole/cavern for those who like the water....or have thalassophobia. Anyways love the content keep up the outstanding work!!!
My guy is upgrading a city that hasen't even been released yeet
What if this become a mmo server?
For the snowy mountains pls pls pls do a camp from either explorers from the mesa that disappeared or the family from the woodland mansion
You're videos, creativity and effort continue to amaze me, all this time and effort and planning you have taken just to give the ultimate world is awesome. Idk how much more you want to add onto this map but you could maybe add a hidden underwater city, which we can access with water breathing potions, have crashed planes, ships, aswell, blimps and cruise ships or something that matches the lore and timezone of this map. Could have a metropolis style city and a hidden mermaid cove or sirens/krakens  (with crashed ships) which adds to more lore
I've heard the warden might be able to burrow... so watch out
i wish there was like a minecraft roleplay movie for that island ?.. if that makes any sence.imagine actual "characters" living at every house, town,biome. :) :")
its just amazing hos i think everytime that it coult be any better but yet he does it and makes it even more awsome. bro how do you do this?!
It would be really cool if you would make a story modpack to this map, that had a wide story, that people could buy or get by being a premium member👽
Will this be playable on bedrock?
I would chose the amethyst team
It would be cool to see a version of this map with create mod stuff in it. Any voulenteers?
Absolutely incredible build, you never fail to impress!
Will this also be available on Bedrock Edition?
I hope you build the nether too
One word: How?!?!
Your like actually insane
I SEARCHED AT JUST THE RIGHT TIME!!!!
You should build a huge sunken ship/ocean area if you haven’t already
I love glowing things, so this build was awesome!
This cave is awesome, honestly it reminds me of City of Ember.
This is truly stunning however I feel like by scrunching drip stone and lush cave in one with the deep dark your missing out on some epic floor looks from the lush caves. Like the floor foliage and pools of axolotl and tropic fish are a big part of lush caves. The extreme amounts of clay etc. just missing out on some key stuff. Maybe make more secret caves that don’t appear in videos and just add to the rest of the secrets.
just a reminder that the skulk blocks on the rooftops all connect to eachother and if you run next to them the whole city and every roof will make crazy loud sounds, i think you should use otherblocks for them but apart from that... 🤯🤯🤯🤯
Will you be doing any of the other dimensions
you've got to admire the creativity. Keep up the good work.
I love your vids keep up the good work
Wow amazing!
Man your work is amazing ! Can’t wait to play on it ! Will the Nether be included? And will there be a end portal somewhere as well?
This projekt is so great and i am looking forwart to the next parts of it
Best one yet
I absolutely LOVE the dwarves aesthetic. This is going to be INCREDIBLE once it drops
I'm just curious will u be upgrading the nether and end after all they are part of survival?
Love this series cant wait to play it!
So cool! This has given me inspiration to make a deep dark monument.
this gives me chilles watching, i love everything you are doing keep up the amazing work <3
You seem like such a chill dude love the videos
Shit. I'm four hours late.
Its so cool to think that I have watched this series for 10 months AND I have moved since then keep up the good work man
God world edit must be nice
are you transforming the nether?
wait jungle giant spider so jungle australia?
Why is there no swamp biome?
TrixyBlox needs a team of YouTubers to help him. Not 2 YouTubers, 5 - 6 YouTubers.  I say we try to get Minecraft YouTubers.  Maybe Grian? Like look at his season 8 Giga base!   If anyone wants to, comment who you think would be perfect for this.
wow, you and steph put so much hard work into this, and it shows! amazing work as always :)
Great video You should do a war between biomes or survival series with subscribers when the map is finally finished.
Just amazing. I can’t wait to play man
🤯
This was the best transformation so far! keep up the epic work trixy!
Are you going to modify the Nether and the Ender
i can't wait for the map to be finished! I'm hoping to explore it with my bf together to get him into minecraft! Amazing work both of you keep it up :)
I love that every structure has a purpose
Incredible. Dwarves are my favorite fantasy peoples and you've done them such remarkable justice with this! I literally had chills at the end reveal. Also, loving the little glow squid popping up throughout, they make a great decorative feature as well haha.
Vikings in the forest
Are you gonna do anything about the nether?
I love the editing.
are you going ahnge the nether and/or the ender? great vid btw
those statues represent kinda slavery xd
got really exited then remembered i’m on xbox
Wow that's a neat new skin ;)  This build is insane! With the short amount of time between episodes I wasn't prepared for the scale of it all. Those statues and how the lava flows between them are sick, it's all just so well done. Awesome episode!!
When a warden has the same amount of health as the Ender dragon and the Wither combined
Beautiful, you should tra to make relaxing video with your work. Just speak more slowly end soft, it would be perfect🥰 ✌️
Is it released? Is it free
I’ve been so ready for this!
holy moly
Yooo this map is becoming sicker and sicker with each video you’re uploading. Congrats for that and keep up the good work!! I can’t wait to play it.. Last but not least, here’s a suggestion for the snowy mountain theme: Japan!! I think it would be cool to see a japanese temple there and a torii gate; it would fit nicely. This is just in case you haven’t decided yet😅
I wish the lush cave is more enchanted and not industrial. But it's still very good considering you're connecting it for the lore
Proceeds to forget the end and nether. They should be transformed too. It would be interesting.
This is stunning work. You are so talented Trixy.
*Trixy talking about wardens guarding hobbit treasure* We thought that this would be a fun way to incorporate the warden as a "FUN." "FREAKING." "MINNI-BOSS." The WARDEN?! yea...... "minni boss"...... right
Those statues look soooooooooo good man fantastic work
Wow. Just wow. This is truly amazing! You really have outdone yourself. Love your videos and builds, keep on making them they’re really good!!
Absolutely insane 😍
Comment
Amazing as usual. This upgrade has to be one of my favorites so far.
Can you make me a world
20:57 omg its obviously amongus
Very nice build, as always! Have you thought about upgrading the nether?
So sick!!! Can’t wait for this to be done so I can get it!
we are the dwarfs and were digging a hole, diggy diggy hole
Hello !! My favorit part was the city part on both side of the cave, and I really loved the banner design moment. The Copper banner is really beautiful with the green and orange colors. Thank you for this new really exiting episode !  Also, would you like the idea of a mushoom luminescent cave ? I know it isn't a Minecraft biome, but since we have the luminescent tree blocs from the nether, I always thought they could be incorporated nicely with mushrooms. It could be a little closed easter egg zone under the Mushroom island, with no direct link to the surface since it isn't a real Minecraft biome. I hope you'll like the idea, even if you dont add it ! Kisses and thank you again
Wait will there be a nether
You should do a civilization video when this map is finished. Or do a youtuber smp
I feel like when this map will be realased alot of YouTuber will make alot of series's.
loving the series. its so epic
It’s a shame that there’s no dwarves in game to populate the city. Come to think of it, cave villages could be a cool idea in vanilla.
This man deserves a break
Idea : Make a structure/mineshaft/room/fossil underground and fill it with dirt/gravel/sand for the players to excavate it. A marker overground (which could be a small structure) could tell the players where to dig.
1 Word Extraordinary  (i suck At Building 😭😭)
You need to upgrade the nether and the end
it would be rly cool if you worked with a redstone master and they redstoned a bunch of the things you made
Maybe anyone knows this. Will this Monster be playable on xbox?
In the snowy biome you should make one of the mountains a volcano.
Will this be available on bedrock?
Really love the USW and can’t wait to see it myself in game, I really really hope that you also upgrade the nether in the same style as the overworld, as in a huge island surrounded by lava oceans and having all the biomes and structures of the nether upgraded, personally I find it disappointing to have a great custom world then a completely vanilla nether.
Noooo not the weapon molds 😭 especially made of gold
"you wont be able to dig straight in" will you be using the new reinforced deepslate stuff, or will you be using bedrock?
I don't care who you are what you believe or how you think. I think everyone can agree these builds and the planning going into them is pure art and just insane.
you should make a large city using the tektopia mod so all the villagers have a proper role
Rock and stone forever ✊
If you want to go one step further, you could upgrade the nether and the end
will the special relics be custom enchanted gear with lore things? you could even use a texture pack to make them actually have custom textures, though I don't know how exactly you can change them.
The snow biome should have a Hindu or Buddhist temple
i’ve never actually seen a “people are not subbed compared to subbed” youtube stat with more than 20% subbed, good job mate !!!
Oh I like it Picasso
How do we get a world download
My absolute favourite build
Heck yeah 🕺🏾🕺🏾🕺🏾
This upgrade is definitely the best one so far
I love it , you could make this one of the best fantasy movies ever made
These are truly amazing keep up the good work 😳😱
Will the market stalls have custom trades villagers? cause that would be a nice way to make it actually somewhere you can gear up for an adventure without just being chests full of loot.
"Oh it's beautiful." - director Krennik
as incredible as this is, the war bonnet maybe wasn't the best move...
I can make custom items and mobs so if want reply
pov: hypixel skyblock crystal hallows in 2077
pogchamp
Are you going to upgrade the nether/end?
I got a he-man and the masters of the universe… it looks awful, not even the original voice actor for he man comes back. It has nothing going for it.
I think it would be interesting if you had to save the underground city from getting overgrown by sculk. You could place sculk catalists around so you would haveto go around getting rid of them
this guy is making a whole ass game at this point
The big sender thingy is a amogus meme
Are you going to do the nether too?
I don't even have words at this point.
I have an idea for USW, what if you also upgraded the main end island.
And like all the mini biomes
R u going to add birch forests
Wow, just wow! By the way, copper faction without doubt
This totally needs a custom in game soundtrack
Nut case, absolutely a mad man, the amount of work ethic u must have us crazy, keep the work up and keep impressing and out doing urself
You know, you should get a couple mod packs to really add some variation of items, gear and other things, to make every biome just a little different
this reminds me alot of Lord of the rings lol
These episodes just keep getting better and better each time
It looks great are you still going to do spawners I heard you say the Warden things were an upgrade for the spawners. I would love to see you upgrade them.
I like how he bases one off copper even though it's a completely useless ore and material... like a fighting faction based off a material you can't use to fight... like what?
WOW!!!
This dwarf statue is  amazing!!!
Bro this gives me Troll Hunter vibes
Hey ive got a really good idea for a next project. How about you rebuild the map of zelda botw
Really cool how the dwarf city has roads connecting everything  Reminds me of the deep roads in dragon age
IMAGINE PLAYING ON THIS MAP WITH 1000 PLAYERS BATTLE ROYALE OR STH
Mad insane builds. Your builds make me want to play minecraft again.
I'm getting hobbit vibes. 😂👌
are u planning to add any npc's ?
I wonder if dragon head from the bone tribe.  the dragon was living in cave. My reasoning is because in north’s mythology there dwarfs name Fafnir who got turn into a dragon do to his own wrath.
the amount of worldbuilding (literally) in this series is incredible and the lore is so interesting to follow!
You know it's a big build when 32 chunk render isn't enough.
this is like skyrim but in minecraft
Idea: you should make one of the corridors that leads to a different biome have an infection of skulk
Is the second statue inspired by the staue in the Ministry of Magic?
I can't wait for this amazing project to be finished! It's gonna be the greatest map ever! When you do the snowy mountains, I think a cool idea would be a castle hidden in the peaks of the mountains! 💜
I can’t wait
Incredible as always, Trixyblox! I always look forward to your videos
sheeeesh
The warden more health then the wither and does 4 hearts per hit, in prot 4 netherite. Please tell me how that is a miniboss  Wonderful build as always
this would be so sick as an origins server.
Don't know if you've already answered this but will you be updating the nether?
I think I’ve asked this before but will this be available on mobile? I really hope it is because I’m on mobile and would love to play this world.
This is really cool. Are you going to be doing anything special with the nether or the end?
Lets hope he doesn’t devolve his channel into cringe like so many others.
Hey do you know what would be a good idea if you were to hollow out the giant skull in the middle of the bone tribe and make it a battle arena
All youre builds are so fabulous i dont know how you do it but youre very very good at building
This is amazing! Can’t wait till it’s done, and will you be updating the world every time a new mob gets added?
Me when you post a new vid: YES! YES IT IS FINALLY DONE
Can’t wait to explore this when it’s done because I love to explore things like ruins in games and make ruins related stuff.
with the amount of lore that is surrounding this map you could make a whole separate game out of it.
is this gonna be installable in bedrock and java?
this is masterpiece
I love you… I wasnt sure if you would use the new updates to the USW and that made me sad. But now its the PERFECT USW!!
For some reason the thing I really liked was the Copper Faction's banner? Idk the colours just flowed really well into each other and it had a cool shape. Of course, as usual, everything you build is absolutely insane and beautiful. can't wait to play the finished map
Isent a mc world 3x3 milion blocks world?
I just wanted to take a moment to appreciate the hard work and dedication that you've been giving to this project. I found this channel when the second episode was released, and I've honestly never looked forward to a project's completion so much as this. The amount of detail and care to create something so intricate and lore-filled, and the inclusivity of so many unique and different cultures around the world is honestly amazing. Thank you for creating such an amazing project, and i cannot wait to play the final thing!!
good vid
Every single episode gets 10x better!  I'm so hyped for the MOUNTAINS
I wonder if he's going to change the nether or end
oh my word dude this was absolutely insane!!!!!! I'm definitely gonna get this map when it's out! I do have a question though, is there a way that we could make this map into a bedrock server?
Video starts at 3:36
TrixyBlox for Hermitcraft2022
You should apply for builder at Hypixel
You can use the WALL from GOT in snowy mountains.
Damn man, seriousley, everytime I see a new USW video I just feel the NEED to play this!! ToT But I don't even have a good computer that could process all this epicness :'c
Where Skyrim reference
So glad 1.18 gave you (and us) more than what we bargained for! The USW is now the top of the glorious iceberg, and the Ultimate Outlands will provide an awesome “side-story/extended story experience”!
Du bekar! Khazâd ai-ménu!
Only three hours and there’s already 1700 Comments
So good
si for  bedrock  and Joanna
Will the usw be available on bedrock edition
release date estimate?
You really are a blessing. This world is just so detailed and has so many cool ideas. I can NOT wait to play it!
Love this! I'd love to see some Ainu structures in the snowy mountains biome! The Ainu are indigenous people from the Hokkaido region of Japan, with some really interesting history, customs and culture!
Are you able to play this on x box when it comes out
How were we supposed to use that QR code? Grab my second phone? 😂😂😂
When this is all done I'd love to see someone take several hundred people and divide them amongst the biomes into factions and see what happens.
I would consider the caves to also be a biome too!
Amazing
Not gonna lie but i think for a long time there is not going to be better update than 1.18.
Are you going to do the nether
The reinforced deepslate frames were an among us meme reference. I don't beleive that mojang is planning on doing anything else with them, though I could be wrong.
Do you have lore planned for the Sculk?
Wow i like
hahaha GIANT DWARF statue haha
This is fantastic! I think I would be in the Amethyst Faction. And sneak and trap the Wardens!
I have never seen someone do such a monumental task. Nj. Dirt houses are still bigger builds(joke. Nothing is bigger than this)
Very cool builds Trixyblox good job!
Minecraft dig sites- the forgotten update they said they would add but we never heard of again
125,326th view here! :D
Absolutely incredible!
I have a question is the going be more mops and boss
This is so epic I love it  But I just realized, how about swamp biome 🤔
This... Is on another level, holy shit
pls pls do bedrock after
Most people say that Minecraft is a kids game but look at what this guy built no child could build such a beautiful build like this!
when I saw the cave it reminded me about the underground kingdom
Nice.
Can you do this again, but 10x bigger? xD The biomes are kinda small. Maybe next project with a team of 3/4 or more?
There's no one else like you. I wish you were minecrafts new developer or something.
Make a Dragons lair in the snowy mountain
Love It! honestly I don't know how you have the patience and the will to stick with it!
gorgeous
It's jaw droppingly good Trixy, seriously 😱
Well, the idea of ​​having a warden guarding resources is a good one, but he will disappear after +-30 seconds if there are no vibrations nearby. So you need to use shriekers.
Should we mention, apart from the incredible appearance of these statues, that they correspond to a human morphology and not to a Minecraft morphology ? Guess we should use imaginatiooooon and think that the USW is a representation of a real world or something
I love this series so much! I’m always super happy when I see a new episode is up!
I LOVE Dwarwen mines
More than 3.30 minutes before even starting the video wow 👎
An idea for the mountains. You could add three kingdom with the story of a war almost taking place but a king would organized a peace meeting with the other but later he would had fallen into madness after finding and examining one of the totem statues from the jungle natives. After he would of been near the statue he would then kill the other kings by poisoning and killing to take all three kingdoms but after killing to many citizens of his new kingdom his guards would the have to kill him.
PLEASE make a huge castle in the mountains like an emperors castle
Everytime I check to see if you uploaded you upload the very next day
hey wasn't the paroh evil
Maaaaan take a nap or holiday for some time 🥵
Hi, nice
i think there is a dragon in the cave called smaug( I didn´t nabed this from the hobbit Nooooooooo)
Dont forget the nether plz we wont a big sobries for nether plz
20:34 looks insane
You single handedly show the world that Minecraft can be a way to express creativity. Every one of your builds are breathtaking and has that “Trixy” flair. I’m sure you’ve inspired so many people to go out there and build what’s on their mind. You’re an artist and a damn good one.
Its my birthday tomorrow
ehuhfdsnf kooooohhhhhhhh
I would love a video in which you show the tools you use, commands with worldedit; where you explain your thought processes, once this massive project is finished. I'd imagine just an hour long video where you uneditly talk and explain your process of creating these amazing statues and builds
obsessed with your creativity C: love It
Are you going to be doing the nether?
I think you need nether builds.
Anyone else seeing Tronjheim?
Be cool if there was a lore server for this
This is sooo crazy
very sad
Yes
This video derserves so much more likes
imagine this world with mods omg
I might have trouble making myself leave the caverns XD
Commenting for the algorithm
very nice
Is there gonna be a custom texture pack for this world?
I would recomended also some nether upgraiding. only some small details after entering the neter.
Well my builds are weak compared to yours, any chance this will be available for minecraft bedrock edition, looking forward to your next video and when its all done i will be watching them all from start to finish lol
It’s amazing how far you come. I remember watching part 1  to this video and have watched every part since. Your builds are amazing, can’t wait you to finish it.
Favorite biome build yet
Unbelievable 🤩
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
I real hope that alex mobs will work on this map
hah,, the build you'll eventually make for the deep dark update is gonna make me poop myself. in a good way of course, haha. good build as always, my friend!
Anyone else thinking of "Diggy Diggy Hole" while watching this
We are very comformed to the world.
How much will this world cost
Yo, quick question, will the Nether also be revamped, as to provide a lot of interesting exploration there as well? (if it's enabled for stuff like Netherite)
I actually watch this the same day he did this video!!
Where can I find this cave
great stuff man. I'll definetly buy the map onces it's out
Still after all this time... I see usw... and I read "und so weiter" wich means and so on in german xD
When is the map coming at for free
If those are the caves i just can't wait to see what you will do with the nether
Incredible!! Everything about the USW blows me away. Keep up the amazing work!
You definitely need a volcano to top everything off. That would be ultimate!!!
Looks sick! I can't wait to find all (if not most) of the hidden lore when it drops!
You should also do the nether/end for the usw world
good job man 👏👍
You should make an stronghold and a nether biome upgrade
this guy should be added to hermitcraft
We need a lotr level movie in thid world
This was so big that in survival mode trixyblox needed speed ll to get around normally
Will you make this available on console and mobile phone
Can’t wait for the tundra, nether, ocean and end!
I've been playing minecraft for around a decade now and this is, by far, the coolest shit I've ever seen. I can't wait for you to finish this map, honestly at this point you could easily sell this for the price of an entire game, spectacular work! Keep it up
Do mountain next but there is a volcano
Yessir
you should do a resource pack for the villagers of each biome, don't you think?
OMG THE GOLD! THATS SO CLAVER!
I have a suggestion. A giant sword stuck in the biggest mountain in the mountain biome.
"I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole. Diggy diggy hole. I'm digging a hole" -Simon the dwarf
To be completely honest, TRIXY ABSOLUTELY DESERVES TO BE IN HERMITCRAFT IN SEASON 9! (fyi this is just my personal opinion, you don’t have to agree)
will you also then nether upragden in the USW?
Great video
Another masterpiece ✨👍
are there any full lore books or videos about the entire history of this realm? I think it would be incredibly fun to build a dnd campaign around, and the players can explore the areas they go to.
I really love every part of this word, I’m so excited for the momento you are gonna released it 🥺🥺🥺💕💕💕
Day 1 of asking for aether kingdom ⛅🕌☁️
It’s so amazing just doing it my mind is blown I also learn something new everything video and you put so much effort into it it’s just AWESOME 🤩 love your vids keep up the great work!
Trixy back with another banger!
I am absolutely going to buy this.
imagine if Minecraft was like this but endless
Maybe upgrade the end portal and the end toooo
this is true dedication.
...and i thought that my builds were ambitious, jesus christ 😭😭 /pos
Close to a year
you should make this into a realm or server or something once done this is too crazy not to have like a multiplayer/rpg aspect its just perfect
It would be so cool to see some custom Mods that introduce custom NPC's and mobs, even events and what not
US ultimate survival XD USA ULTIMATE SURVIVAL ADVENTURE XDDDDD
Ur building skills are amazing keep it up love ur vids!
I love solving lore of games.
3:34 to skip the sponsor
The underworld atleast the  village of caves looks like hollow knight one 🤤
Thought using minecraft play this on VR which would be evem more immersive
Hey TrixyBlox, out of sheer curiosity, did you grow up reading the Builder’s Handbook out of the four books they released back then?
Imagine like 200 players playing with this map and making their own nations, wars and all that
Can you please help me with a minecraft project
this is epic!!
OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOD THIS IS THE BEST ONE YET!!!! I’m BLOWN away. Yet again, you have lit a fire in my Minecraft spirit.
The amount of lag is gonna be urkaoqkqnwywbwnshsbwvwwbejsyedien.
you should do the nether
This is so epic! Can’t wait to play it when it’s finished🤗
amethyst faction all the way, this whole world is incredible
Epic.
how many gigabytes this this world take up
Hey can you make a small abandoned cave that leads too a place that has some ruins that the dwarves tried to makea a expansion to the city but then a "warden king" took his warden army and took it over so they dicided to block it off and if you can find the hidden cave you can enter a overgrown sculk ridden warden society. it could tie into the story of the dwarves easily. it could also lead to some tresaure and some other cool stuff.
Make thé nether or the lender
Is there anything this man can’t do tho
I really want to play this
I am speechless. Your work is one of one. I have never seen anything like it. You are incredibly talented and the sheer amount of work you put in these builds is inspiring! Great, great content keep it up and also I hope it is rewarding enough and it makes you happy because that is the most important thing. Thank you so much for everything you do for us through your videos. Good luck in the future.
aw man wait till the dwarfs realize the wardens respawn XD
I feel like you could write a pretty good fantasy novel. This world is like the playable version!
Will this be available for bedrock? If it is, I'll probably never go outside for a couple of months.
i would like to ask if you plan to touch the nether at all, i would like to see what you would do with it but it is completely understandable if you don't
is this going to also be on minecraft bedrock editon
Every single episode manages to be better than the last! Incredible
Nether next?
I think the mines could be nicer with tinkers construct
These statues are getting a lil too good trixy
If you are still looking for inspiration for snowy mountains I think taht you may find some good ideas from Genshin impact's Dragonspine
Can you do snowy Mountain next please
if i was him i would have made this world pay to play
Will the outlands be open for the establishment of player based kingdoms?
Is it going de on the bedrock marketplace
If i could i would subscribe a second time.
I love it! I'm so looking forward to playing this map when it comes out! I have been wondering though, are you planning on transforming the nether as well? I would love to see your take on a bastion for the usw!
The skulk roofs felt off.
Your builds are crazy as always, this is just a great channel for minecraft-, especially building lovers. Can't wait until the map is out!!
I don't wanna give you any pain or anything, and I am not telling you how to do your job, but what about the end and nether? I understand if you cant do those because it's been a lot of work for you to do just one world, and to do two more would take a long while. I am still very impressed
You’ve left me in awe
sheeesh
This has to be one of the coolest things I have ever seen
I can't believe it had already been so long.
this is incredible
My predictions: Taiga would be wikings style, and snow mountains would be or medieval magic castle style or antarctic style
It would be cool if you build an Archipelago with 1.18/1.19 theme for like the post game (?
The portal frames are a trolle! They are an among us imposstor!
I'm always amazed by your works, looking forward to your next project!
What about hiding some custom command block weapons?
you should have someone make a mod or do stuff with commands so you can actually find dwarves and other people from the biomes other than that this is amazing
Do you ever plan on adding this to the bedrock store
I wonder is he gonna do the nether or the nether is just gonna be the original lol
This is shaping up into such a masterpiece! Congratz to the artist :)
honestly this would be an amazing 1.18 skyblock map
All of your builds are truly amazing! Cant wait for the next video for the series!
this is art
I dont even play minecraft that often anymore but ur videos are one of my favourites to watch on youtube for sure when they come out|
Upgrade nether pls.
This will be so fun to play
Will the USW be on minecraft marketplace???
Jesus Christ he’s done it again
I have been waiting for this forever Thank you for posting
what goes through your mind while thinking about this all? i wouldnt even be able to imagine building anything near this level of detail and ontop of that you make it so all makes sense to make it feel more alive and buisy while nothing is there. I absolutely adore your videos!
HOLY MOLLY THAT IS BEAUTIFUL 🥳😎🤯😮
i have an intersting question, the villagers you use for all these builds and market trading places and all are they all ready maxed out or jsut defalut?
oh?
and no plains statue
Man ur crazy 😂😂
This is so epic, but i have a suggestion when u get to the snowy mountains u can make a floating island with a wizard tower that will be tricky to ge to, i think that would be insane
Pleeeease do a tutorial for the atlas statue
This is the coolest one yet in my opinion
This is easily my favorite upgrade so far. I cannot wait to explore this entire world!
How long did it take you to start huge builds like this?
You should make Russian/Slavic style archetecture in the tundra/taiga region, it would be dope to see some sort of structure like St. Basil's Cathedral
*Cries in 12 render distance*
Best so far
this is sick!!!
Another great addition to this beautiful map.
DAMN! Everything about this world is just so grand and epic! Like GoT or LotR or something! I love this!
you are insane at building
Dang. This series gets better with every new development. Thank you so much for making this TrixyBlox! I can't wait to play on this world myself when it comes out! :)
I love it!!!!!!Please make more of these builds!!!They are VERY GOOD!!!
there no plains tunnel
:0
Hi tryxiblox why dont you Add a gaient land for gaients❔❔❔
Not just a great builder Thats a great plot aswell
Every episode gets more and more insane... It's amazing!
I've thought that the update would be a hindrance to the USW, but it turns out that it made it much more amazing
Lol I just had finished rewatching the last build episode for inspiration and this just tops it all
There's no swamp biome?
can you do some nether stuff too
ur actually insane, mad respect
I love this so much
I'm going to attempt this kinda world type build in mcpe I'm going to build this same type of castle underground but the cave is smaller but is still good for building and I'm thinking of having a tunnel to the deep dark cities from the mine as if the people there found it and trying to go in but no one returns because the monster lies within
When the wild update releases there are gonna be some more biomes lol
I want to see the final product but I don’t know what I’ll do if there are no more of these videos. These are awesome keep it up
👍👍👍👍👍✌🏻
INSANE! WANT MORE
If they put this map on the switch I will be downloading it
What if everyone on the server destroys the buildings 😆
i already know that i m gonna get mega lost in those caves
the statues look soooo epic
VERY nice Video!!
Imagine uploading this world to a private server and doing a survival playthrough with some friends. That would be dope
im honestly so excited for this to be finished so i can play it and maybe get some friends to join with me. id love to have a faction thing where we all choose to stay in a specific biome area.  my one question is will the world be  continously updated to work with the most current version of minecraft?
We're is a stronghold
I wish this was on bedrock
Minecraft just needs to hire this man
Here's an interesting question. Where does the Minecraft world take place? Earth? Earth in the future? Earth in the past? A different planet? Another dimension? The inner Earth? A flat Earth?
This made me wanna go play Skyrim again
Beautiful
60% HOW HE IS SO GOOD
Im the 1 thousand comment
This building is so epic! I cant even explain how great this is! I cant wait to explore it and find all the secrets.
This remind me so much the Hobbit, the part where they restart the gold smelter in the Mountain. I really likes It so much Is really cool great job
This is absolutely stunning!  I was wondering, since the USW seems to delve a bit deeper into classic fantasy, if you are going to add elves too, now that the dwarves are present (I mean you can't have dwarves but no elves they kinda go hand in hand. I think an island with venetian-style architechture would suit them really well, they could be sort of outsiders who mostly dabble in trade. Also, to put it more into the whole upgrading minecraft & adding story thing: A huge earthquake or another enormous power could have ripped the island apart, letting the city centre sink into the sea (atlantis style, to address the underwater exploration part). So you would have a sort of doughnut shaped island with the most valuable/important buildings sunk in the middle. What do you guys think?
Cool 👍👍
Can you make a server of this it would be so nice whit diffrent leaders that are real players  npc in all clans. Sorry for misspelling i am not very good at english
In the snowy mountains there shouLd be a mountain that goes up to the build Limit and at the top a hoLe that goes down to the void
are you upgrading the stronghold or the underwater ruins in the next video
The USW, with realistic graphics and not the blocks, would be an awesome Dark Souls game
I'm blown away
Ayo the forge is INCREDIBLE i wish i could build something like that Also is it going yo be avaible only to java?
Imagine how crazy a TrixyBlox survival series would be, with his building talent (wink wink)
will you do another website for pepule who can't open pateron?,like me.....and will it be 100% freebie?,can players play in this world with multiplaer??,please respon and thanks,your big fan Adem✌❤😄😄
looks like there's 5 builds left unless he leaves out the nether and end limensions then it will be 2 builds left
you think to upgrade stronghold and nether fortres bastion?
I love this project !!!
I can’t wait for the snowy mountains!
Where are the shriekers that summon the warden?
I bet the only reason people are gonna come to this place is to ride on the minecart system. Also this build is my fav in the USW yet! I love the way the different colours contrast yet complement each other so well and bring so much life to the caves! It’s also really nostalgic  bc the massive cave overhaul was the first of your videos that I watched
I wish deap dark city looks like this and I have a story for this but it's too long
Man, u are insane, I love all of your vids, I've never seen builder better than u 😮
Hi
this is looks like 2000 of the best minecraft builders ever and they all collabarated to mkae this but nope its one person and then he made this like how but the only thing to nake the entire usw better would be mods like npcs and items
HOLY SHIT ONLY 80K VIEWS IN AN HOUR???? I JUST REALIZED HOW UNDERATED YOU ARE
I feel as if someone should code this to have an origins mod, that would be cool 😎
Have you thought about hiring any "beta testers"?
i think it would be cool if he made a texture pack to go with the build
this guy prob has made somewhere from 750K to 3M USD from his youtube channel. most from the USW series.
It looks amasing👍
I love you
This is beatiful its looks very good and i would like to know how to build luke this
Its full of fun and games in the USW until that one friend in the game decides to make a new "Atomic" Saga in the World
What happend with the USW if you dont reach the Like goal? I love the USW yaay the next Episode.
Im sorry but at first i thought that was your haircut 😂😂
This dude Trixy is crazzyyyyy with it
I recon for the statues kneeling down they would have a sword a stick it into the ground and lava would be in the middle of the swords
Somewhere in the plains you should hide some hobbit esc. Thing such as  The Shire for a easter egg
erebor but wooooooooooooow so cool
Hmm... I do hope that, whenever you return to the villains of this series, you make some statues of the I think your friend called them 12 demons or something? Had some minor ideas there, if you're interested:  Basically, take the concepts of mobs(whether they be from vanilla minecraft, minecraft dungeons, or minecraft story mode) and having the demons be in wife/husband pairs, with various mobs being their children(though perhaps having The Wither being a weakened avatar to one). With the known mobs being entities that combine aspects from both parents. In other words, the parents have half the attributes of the mobs they represent, while filling any gaps in their forms with whatever you felt like adding.
You do REALLY good
your content makes me want to make a hardcore world
You should collab with Jeracraft, he has a “Deadmines Tram” that he says could lead to other islands!
23k like and 2 dislikes.... god your content is good
You should put this map on the marketplace
Glowing squids be there like O_o
Do you think you will Upgrade the Nether ? ( Nice video btw )
This city alone is the perfect map for these Minecraft 100 days civilizations videos.
if minecraft had npc’s this man would have the greatest minecraft open world rpg.
doing great cant wait for it to upload
Will the download cost any money? Will we have to be a member or subscriber to get this world?
This was the BEST so far!   LOVED IT!😃😃😃
DWARF
Builds like this make me wish bedrock edition had world edit and a world paint thing
Keep Going and good luck/
Can you Make taiga biome kind of Finland/Lapland style, it would bee cool 🇫🇮
Your creativity and builds are insane
This will be painful to mine out somethin so beautiful
I am NOT a bot, but I wonder how many subscribers I can. get from this comment... 👀 Current: 1.08k (BTW love the builds TrixyBlox)
This looks truly incredible. Although I have one thing to say, despite how amazing these builds look. It's going to feel quite lonely and abandoned when you're exploring them. by adding in an enormous amount of villagers and wandering traders, it would really improve the experience!  PS: I would join the copper faction!
YOOOO! I have been waiting so long :)
Great job on the build
give this man some respect for thos statues
Hey Trix can you remake the  nether 😆               Heh just 😂 kidding
You should transform the end and nether   structures
You should make a map rebel inc has good máps to choose from
It’s beautiful !! Respect +++👍👍
Were you inspired by an old comment?
Can you maybe stream your work on the USW, it would be cool.
can you make costome mobs ?
One suggestion: Now that more islands have been added because of the update, it doesn't make too much sense lore wise for the people of the main island to have remained there and not explored or traded with people outside the island. I recommend adding something like difficult to traverse rock formations around the island, or remains of large water monsters e.t.c. Stuff like that would explain why that never happened + would make some awesome additions imo.
As usual, love your designs.:D
Here's an idea: Why not have an axolotl town kind of thing under the water of the city?
I love it!! brings me back to lord of the rings!!
Once you built the snowy mountain town please make to town hidden : >
OMG there are no words! Keep up the good work, its so satisfying how good your are
Its just looks so quacking insane
make your intro shorter dude it was 4 min long
I'm sub Brazilian
My toxic trait is believing I can do all of this in survival
3:35
mojang needs to hire this guy
upgrade also the nether and the end
This is literally one of the best builds I have ever seen and I spend the entirety of my life on youtube trying to upgrade my cube house.
I love this, keep up the good work, i hope this turns out good, and hope your channel grow more
Wow that s so cool
u should make an ocean empirre
This episode sponsored by Carmex
hi, i have been following this series for a while and am feeling like the dark oak forest is king of drab compared to the amazing builds you have done in the other biome, I mean no offence but I was thinking like, a massive haunted cannon that ties into the lore somehow in the Dark Oak
Being the biggest fan of The Hobbit and LoTR, this is literally the best upgrade for me, 1018373617/10.
I love your new skin
i would LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE a realistic volcano in this lol Also HOW AND ITS SO BIG, Im legit prob gonna buy your  patreon just for this when it comes out its so good
You are the GOAT.
Words cant describe how awesome this whole project is
will the world download be free after its done?
The coolest thing ever that could be added to this is that it could become a giant multiplayer map and when you first join you can choose what biome or area you want to live in, this could give the map a more lively, story feeling
BEST UPGARDE EVER THE BEST BUILD I HAVE EVER SEEN AND AN UNDERCUT ON THE SUPPORT THIS DESERVES A 100% SUPPORT
This is awesome, goddamn.
I think it would be cool if you added people who leve in the sky. Maybe they have casteles on top of the clouds.
When he finished this he should do a survival world Ik he knows where stuff is but it still be cool to watch
I think this world would be so much better if it had custom bosses like the fero (srry I spelled that wrong) and maby the mutant mobs
Absolutely beautiful probably the best of all the builds I can't imagine anyone else ever being able to build something like this
'A giant dwarf statue'
I love the new build it’s the best so farr I’m building something very similar on a smaller scale. Btw statue people are very very hard to sculpt so good job!
I have a suggestion for the last two biomes. I think either Buddhist or Shinto religions/structures would be really cool. I have been playing a lot of Legends Arceus, so I'm thinking the Taiga would be a perfect place for Japanese inspired builds. Maybe even some shrines surrounding foxes, like in Ghost of Tsushima.
With the update making new distant lands, it’s like the USW island is the main game and the far lands act as a post-game adventure
It would be really cool if you could do a "civilization" event when this map Is done
Can we just appreciate how the audio instantly starts with him saying "I spent..." so that when you spam the left arrow key you can make a beat
7:58 me when furry
Love your videos and your builds, keep up the good work!
its giving me god of war vibe ;-;
This just be the best one yet
i can't believe this has been going on so long! i love watching these videos
Trixxy I fuckilove you bro great videos keep em coming
At first i was like : I can play with one or two friends, it's seems nice. But now i'm like : Okey. So i need at leats 30 people and do a factions serv or somethings similar.   The work put in the creation of this map is just amazing. Definitly the most incredible map ever thank you so much for all of that <3
When this is done will it be bedrock compatible cause I don't have Java but will like to try this
i cant play 1.18 😥
Oh I have an idea what if you try transforming the nether bastian's or Fortress
Best thing to watch after a long day at school!
Your a king at turning the survival worlds
Funfact!: usw. is a german abbreviation for "und so weiter" which translates to "and so forth"
I really hope when it is done it can be played by tlauncher users too TwT
The whole entire lore of the usw would make a Hella good dnd setting what an amazing thing this is
Reaaaaaly Nice and Upgrade you the nether to (im sorry english isnt my real laguage )
I loved this upgrade so much! I’m so glad you incorporated the new cave and cliffs and wild update! Freakin brilliant
The map when is finish is going to be free?
Hey, i know it's probably sad and dissapointing, but... It's pretty much confirmed that the 20:56 structures are basicly an among us meme, which the game creators incorporated into the game as a joke. If you don't belive me look it up. One of the creators even mentioned it on his twitter, or instagram. And if you right click the frame with a flint and steel the whole portal gets a layer of glas, which really starts looking like an among us person.    Great Video by the way!
The fact you pulled inspiration from your cave kingdom build makes me wonder if you got plans to pull from your sea kingdom build at some point as well.
those statues and their layout was absolutely beautiful, dude
Is no one gonna talk about his lips damn I can almost see my self in them.
Ultimate gg
I'm in love with this world...  Take your time mate.
It is such a cool project. I cant wait to download the World!
Thoughts on the stroghold?
You should upgrade the nether and the end
how do u keep the wardens from digging down and despawning?
you my man are a legend
I truly hate designers like you. Well, I also love designers like you. But I'm so inspired by the builds that I'm overwhelmed!!! Why do you have to be so damn good?!!!
when you finish the map try doing a civilization sever video
All i can say right now is ''oooohhhh YEEEEAAAAHHH!!!'
Modus
Will this be on bedrock in the marketplace?
This episode was just amazing and the creativity used is genius level keep up the good work dude
huge inspiration thank you🙌
This guy is making a more complete game than Bloodborne inside Minecraft
THIS IS SO COOL!
Can you make an abandoned house in the snow biome
You should do an updated version of your Underground Kingdom with the 1.18/1.19 features!
This guy is making a more complete game than Bloodborne inside Minecraft
I can't wait to play this in minecraft!
Talks about dwarfs in a cave:  My brain: "I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole, diggy diggy...."
I think a big Kingdom in the North would be really nice.
Hey man appreciate your hard work and creativity I have a suggestion for you can you upscale the biomes of nether and the end dimension and end cities
Awesome, i love the way you put some details into this project, even the floor's got some beautiful design.... I can say if this build is perfect 👌💯
I can't even wait till i play this Map! I wouldn't mind paying Patreon for the map either! Gosh Damn
How on earth are you making such magnificent statues?? Pls can you make a vid with some tips at some point?? Am really struggling to get good at building so i can make a medieval server.
where ancient city? i only see normal city. the ancient city is small and cramped and scary
Dude, with every video you blow my mind. fuckin sick man.
Then give to dream smp to make a society or something
these just keep getting better
It loos like erabor from the hobbit
TrixyBlox legendary video ends…  Me: looking for “Super Like” button
Ebic
Next Episode: Do a secret pillaged training site at the top of the mountains, kinda like the League of shadows training area in Batman Begins… 🗻🏯
Wow these keep getting better and better you go
I think that a Eastern orthodox style might be nice for the taiga village?
Im always so conflicted between not wanting to watch these so I can play the world blind and wanting to see every update
I can tell you love making a narrative, and I’m all for it!
This is such an awesome addition!
How long did it take you to do
I love it it amazing but since you have  Dwarf what about elf. Im sure you  already have plans for next. Can't wait to see next
MOD THIS
I wish i coule build as good as you.
you should add geysers above the cave with alot of steam coming out to show the steam isnt all trapped in the cave
Its my birthday today and i completely relaxed watching this video (Netherlands)
They said the Reinforced Deepslate bricks(did i spell tht right?) were a Among us Joke
Will you upgrade the nether and end as well?
This is so amazing!!
The bulids are amazing and is remarkable how much time put into the bulids truly amazing.
Suggestion for snowy mountains: Something kind of like Moria from LOTR
If no one turns this into an rpg or rpgmmo ill be disappointed
I love the build truly, but I'm upset that that's all you did with the warden. Its generally a terrifying mob and its meant to be a truly horror experience when encountering it.
I'm exited to see it when its done😁
Man, I'd love to see that could you do in Hermitcraft
Howmutch will map be
Is the USW also for Pocket Edition? I’ve been watching from the start. Spam this comment so he will say something
Wow Cant Wait for the Map!
Can you upload it for free plz
This is absolutely amazing we’ll done. Will you be upgrading the nether and the end
Noice
Hey TrixyBlox your world is insane but i think it would be even better if all of the structures would really work, like trading special stuff with the villigers or so and there is a german yt called tjc (thejocraft) who is amazing in such stuff maybe a coorparation would be cool?   Sry for my englisch 😂 not my best
USW = United States of the Warden
Great build keep up the hard work.
I don´t even know what to say. This is freaking awesome!!
Please do a buddhist template for the snowy mountains
copper golem would be nice as well❤️😭🔥🤘
That looks like mogus
Just a question, where will the End portal located and will you also remodel a part of the End dimension? Amazing work here btw

Somehow you keep outdoing yourself, can’t wait for this to release!
there is 0 reason not to subscribe to this guy he's literally the best Minecraft YouTube
Ok I am just gonna say it... WOW. That is incredible!!! Mojang should higher you for the game designer because you are probably the best builder out there! That lush cave was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.  Good job! 👍
This comment is a sacrifice to the almighty algorithm gods.
Is the USW also for Pocket Edition? I’ve been watching from the start. Spam this comment so he will say something
I cant your videos never stop!!! I discovered you since two weeks and already a big fan
This looks amazing, and the statues are absolutely fantastic. I love this serie!
Just imagine that you don’t know trixyblox. You’re searching for a custom world and you see THIS masterwork...
what do i think..? two words, HOLY SH1T
It is unfortunate that reinforced deepslate is just part of an among us reference
Will you be upgrading the nether and too? And will you add a stronghold because that would be really epic
this dude has a lot of time on his hands
Funfact: usw in german is short for "und so weiter" and translates to "and so on" For the scale of your project it is somehow fitting :D
When you realize these are made in a Block game where 1 block is half your size...
This episode was insane!! Very good job!
"So with that, lets take a look at the USW's new upgraded caves..."  *Taco Bell Ad*
12 mins in and i cant believe what my eyes are seeing :D I really want to play it but sadly my parents wont buy it and im not mad i cant experience this masterpiece bc it has so much work it will be crime giving it for free! You have my respect bro.
I AM A DWARF AND IM DIGGING A HOLE DIGGY DIGGY HOLE DIGGING A HOLE
How long does it take to cross the USW on foot?
first
fav serie keep it up! cant wait till the next!
I have an idea what if there was a tiny faction of people who were like animal tamers or SMH but like randomly placed as an Easter egg
10 months lol
This looks so good!!
My computer is lagging just watching this video. I might buy a new one just to play this map.
Yo how is this produced? How is the 'panning through timelapse' thing done?
This episode reminds me of the hobbit movies! Keep up the hard work!
yeah ill def buy this map when it drops at this point, like you could charge 25 bucks id buy it
Is the map going to cost money or do you just need to be a patreon to download it?
I LOVE THIS WAYY TO MUCH
A normal survival minecraft world is 3 milion blocks wide and loong. So this island can't be 16 milion blocks... False advertising!
Please tell me this is gonna be free....
*snap* just like that the video ive been waiting to come out for months is gone
Cool build btw
I can't wait to play this map!😃 it's gonna be the best ever!
Are you gonna add a mod that makes dwarfs and better villagers?
Trixy, you should make a custom end, like philzas end Lantus from series four.
I N S A N E
Spammm pooooogggggg
*Cave. Not caves
Are going to Upgrade the End and the Nether?
I just have one question,will this work with mods?
This reminds me of places u can see in souls like games
The fact that the main lava flow isn’t central is far too annoying
Can you do upgraded never an end and custom dimensions
Playing without shaders in this area would be impossible lol
Are there going to be npc just walking around the kingdoms
So. F***ing. AWESOME!
This is so epic! Keep up the good work!
I have to ask whats your shader? And please do keep up the work I would love to see the finished world.
Can you make this map in the marketplace for the people Who play on bedrock edition please? From italy :)
Where’s the download link
My man, u looking a little chonk. Are u getting any exercise while working on this huuuuge project? We r excited abt this project but please take care bro
When all of this is said and done you should make us server with this map I think it would be a lot of fun to play this on multiplayer
WOW 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏cool
At this point, This Minecraft map is as Big as a AAA Playstation Game
This cave looks soo amazing. I'm really impressed of how much afford you put into your builds. Also what I'd love to see would be some changes to the nether and the end too.
8:17 that head dress looks great, It looks really accurate, to my tribe at least.
what if the dwarfs have a little skulk in their body and they can feel the vibrations of the ores and that's how they found them?
Dude who isn't subbed to this guy his building is literally on another level and he is super fun to watch who ever isn't subscribed is crazy
there is no word for my exitment, your work is amazing, can't wait to live with my fellow dwarfs homies
are you gonna do the sea temple
Omg yay! Someone told me that this vid wouldn't be out by now. I wanted it as a late bd present but here we are! Amazing vid!
best project
Another day, another trip underground. I'm beginning to think the Great Spirit likes Onua best..
Contrats on 2 millions
I hope there will be lore in the library
This lore is nice... Not gonna follow it but it's nice I like it
Wait whata abaout the end?
Holy smokes this one was epic🔥
Love this. I’d join the amethyst faction and use stealth against the warden.  Could you please do the taiga and or snowy mountains next? Maybe some kind of ancient ski resort would be cool.
This man is an absolute madlad. This is crazy! 🔥
Props to this guy seriously. The amount of work he puts in is insane.
It's crazy
This mini stories have a big potential to become an move series ore a normal series, this is crazy, I have go an entire script in my head
HOLY CRAP, when I play this with my buddies I am claiming the mines as my own, every day in the week no doubt about it! Epic video dude!
I was wondering if you were going to upgrade the structures in the different dimensions ?
The games that I shocked, went looking at someone creativity is either Minecraft or Terraria
Can we use the usw in servers? If so, im gonna be playing with my friends :D
anyone else notice how he very much didnt say where this is in the world? love that adds a nice bit of exploring you need to do!
i think the deep dark city is an ancient ruin of a prosperous city made by the ancient ancestors of the villager race, dedicated to all the original arts, with magic, and music, and art, and story telling, and even it's own language, and the worshiping of a powerful, godly being, resembling the warden, that they made the central part of the city to resemble. this is like the story of the titanic. the city was supposed to be impenetrable, and it wasn't supposed to fall. but then, the scientists researching the wonders of the caves, and the surface discovered a powerful substance, which they brought within the walls of the city. this substance started a plague of death, and suffering. they could not escape it. it spread too fast. it then developed a monster out of the great guards of the city, the warden. within a matter of a week, the entire villager race was extinct accept for but a few who managed to escape, and the city was left desolate, and devoid of life accept for the monstrous guards of this tomb, which lurk under the ground, waiting to be awakened so it can kill yet another victim. i think you focused too much on the fact that it was a prosperous dwarven city, rather than make it a huge, barren ruin of something that was once great, but now is fallen, and dying. but otherwise, great job man! you never cease to amaze me with your firm, and ever growing ability to stand out, and make something truly wonderful. i absolutely loved the sheer immensity of this build, and the amazing detail you managed to put into the statues, and other elements of the build. the idea of the factions was genius, and i loved how you used that big brain of yours to combine the elements of all three cave biomes, and even the amethyst geodes! just the growing sense of effort you put into making something big, beautiful, and even with a back story, is enough to set an example for all the builders out there, and inspire me, as well as agreeably a LOT of other people to make something that we are proud of.
should you play this (when it comes out) on adventure mode or normal survival?
Can't wait to explore this beauty 🤯❤
I love seeing the shulk sensors lighting up as you build. Almost reminds me of a lighting storm on fast forward.
This is insaaaaane!!!!! Seriosly seriously cool!
Amazing
that's so mind-blowing to see, and it's such a cool map, the amount of work and care is unmatched, very unfortunate that I won't get to play on this map since I'm a bedrock player but it's still so cool to see the map develop over the past months
I really love this series :)
Despite your amazing builds overall, accepting notourious companies such as Dragon City as a sponsor ruins the magic here. Games like Dragon City intentionally rig loot crates and other items in order to find a balance between keeping loot decent, but not perfect, so they buy more crates. In other words, this sort of game leeches their pay-to-win profits by convincing young adults and children to spend money they don't have. That brings me to my next point: Children. A game esentially based off the exchange of real-world currency for gambling enables kids to start (and get hooked) to gambling from a very young age. I personally do not support the idea of accepting sponsorships from selfish companies, but suit yourself.  Reguardless, before people reply to me saying, "hE hAs To MaKE monEY soMEhOW," I understand that. However, for such a large project, I can guarentee there is a large ammount of sponsorships. Even then, creators tend not to actually directly communicate to their sponsors, instead connecting through 3rd party companies, desperate to get in sponsorships for decent cuts. What I am trying to bring in to words here is that for large projects like this, pulling in millions of views, I *am certain* there are more sponsorships out here. Companies such as Social Point and Plarium Games only get in sponsorships due to their will to offer obsurd ammounts to creators, so I don't blame you for going with them. However, this is my personal message to you just letting you know these companies are the ones causing gambling addictions in children. (God I sound like a 30 year old karen, writing a flipping essay over this xD.)
Man I have no words, but here is what I can say. You are the greatest and the most TALENTED builder I (and I'm pretty sure everyone else watching this video) have EVER SEEN. Great job man, I wish I had your skill
Music was amazing! Great work. I’m more excited for this than any actual Minecraft release!
Wow, I can't even say more about this than wow that's amazing
This is my favourite build you've ever done I love the hobbit and I love your creativity so to see them combined is amazing I love your content
You are a genius when will this Minecraft world be posted when it’s done what type of code
You truly amaze us trix hope you continue this! i really admire you! Wish you keep healthy and safe same with steph!
Boegoe
Man are u build massive, not say extremely good will the USW map be available for people outside of patreon?
I live for these videos
Ngl these builds are good like JUuST a bit better than I can build. HMm hMm can't build basic house. Anyway. What shaders are they. I'd really like them to enhance everything
Dude, you and steph are so cool. So cool.
How is this guy so incredible? I love everything he do.
Everytime this is just more impressive, tho i wonder, is he gona do the end and the nether aswell??
I hate dragon city u.
Wow im not even gonna lie bro this looks freakin awesome. I dont play minecraft but i sure as hell will be for this! When does it release?! (For free to the public)
This reminds me of Blackreach on Skyrim
Yo
For the mountain biome you should make a Slavic themed village with the Slavic church
why do I have to pay more for your patreon just because I play on bedrock, it is not fair, I want to play in this world!
Why is dwarf tall
While watching this I wonder, what happens when Minecraft reaches 1.20?
You are my hero :O
Wow, godlike building.
Each one of these episodes blow my mind! It’s truly amazing how you mange to add so much detail and explain it all so well.  Thanks for the amazing content and I’m super excited to continuing watching all of the following episodes.
Do you planning to add ellfs city to usw? They have realy cool house theme. And something like great underground tree would be super cool and allso it would be great opportunity to add realy lush caves or even amethyst forest.
You should put a barrier around the world
I live your Videos. This looks so amazing :)
11 minutes in there is a time lapse of him building the underground bridge and the glow squid swim lightning fast lmao
I haven't been this early to any YouTuber's (with 1M+ subscribers) video, ever...
THIRTY NINE PERCENT????
I have no doubts. This man is the best builder in this community. I have no words how beautiful this build is. Good job Trixy!
this man is really stalling to not build the taiga and snowy mountains, personally i love these biomes
cant wait for release
I would like to see in the taiga forest a North Idaho themed logging town/silver mining Town, like the Silver Valley or Saint Joe Valley
i know it goes against the whole ultimate survival thing but i feel like some data pack or mod to incorporate npcs to make the BEATIFUL areas of this unbelievable world feel less barren and empty like how there will be jungle dwellers in the jungle pharos in the desert dwarves in the mines to give you objectives and rewards
The skulk on the dwarf marketplace could serve as a bell alerting the dwarfs that someone is looking at there stuff. It could also alert them if someone is trying to rob something.
Have you ever considered getting into architecture?
I think you should make some bandit tents or towers
Would be so cool for u to do this for the nether and end but it looks so good anyway
You're literally a god in building things and creating an epic world
U did it again !! Fantastic build looks amazing xx
You should do the part of the ocean around the island
This is an insane project  can't wait to see the finished product! You really put your effort into it, and I love it! You're insanely good at this :)
Wonder if trixy could hire a redstone specialist to come in at the end and make some of the mechanical things actually functional. that would be wild!
I love these videos, I cannot wait for it to be finished it's already epic! 💖💖💖
I love how it’s called USW because in Germany we use USW as a shortcut to say “und so weiter” witch basically means “and so on” Idk why this is so funny to me but I love this series so much you are all so incredible builders and I’m so happy I discovered ur channel
Are you goin to do the end and nether?
6:59 this is not a dwarf statue this is a Fat Thor statue
TrixyBlox build is crazy as always.
This series is amazing and I love how much detail goes not these builds. I also have some ideas for future builds and some suggestions. 1. I would love to see a secret medieval castle in the mountains. 2. Dungeons around the map would be awesome like an mmorpg game 3. A railroad track all throughout the map would be awesome like people traveling throughout the map 4. Little huts or houses in the empty parts of the map but not to much like secret houses 5. Rivers and ponds throughout the map would look awesome 6. In the snowy parts of the map could be like a cave or multiple with frozen animals or cavemen in them 7. Maybe add secret dragons or a dragon in the sky would be cool 8. It would be awesome if you could add like a mushroom forest or like a magical/mystical forest 9. A lava place with a lava golem or something like that 10. Mythical creatures around the map  11. An elf forest or city  That’s about it sorry for all the idea it’d be cool if you could add at least 1 or 2 of them
What if after you finish your plans with this island, you create your own biome or another island with custom biomes of your choice?
This map is in desperate need of modded music. Imagine an amazing score plays as you first lay your eyes on this masterpiece of a build.
This cave is the best build you ever done in the USW. I love it.❤❤❤ Big kiss from France 🇨🇵❤
Now we just need a mod that will add All the new stuff for this map
Will u give us free download pls  Pls give free download so everyone can expreience it for free pls  🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
This whole project is worthy of a book trilogy. I’d 100% read it
I don’t say u HAVE to but if you are bored you can always make a nether version as well
I’m sure this is exactly what Tolkien had in mind when he wrote lord of the rings, But you only just released your last video, how on earth did you get this much done? 😑
i would love to live there
I love this 😀
This is amazing! I'm actually speechless..   Btw, will you guys add a nether makeover?
Is there any chance you will be adding the USW to bedrock
try also upgrade nether if that possible
I love how he’s out here making Mega structures and I’m trying to make a house
😲👍
Anyone realise that the laver from the hammer is off center
Take all my money, even though I don’t play Minecraft anymore
U should join the teams where they build the earth, 1:1 scale
Those fuc*ing statues are impressive man...
Can you please do tutorial on the wooden mansion
I’m really hyped to see what you will do with the nether and the end, and what the lore will be for these two!
Don't forget the "portal" of fortified deepstone
i kindda think the jungle king looks like jesus
Every time you make a new builds on the beautiful biome , I wish that I could also build like you and you have inspired my in minecraft journey ❤️ Great video and builds 👍🏻
Mmm now this is the good shat
someone needs to mod this map. It’s all well and good on its own as a build, but if you try playing this in survival it’ll feel vacant and lifeless. need that lively touch to it
Now do it in hardcore
bro your an awesome builder and im happy that u get to share  this my favourite part of all your builds are the law the underground build are all ways the best keep up the work
Idea: make other little islands off into the ocean with treasure and ship wrecks to explore.
Pls improve the nether and the end too it will be so good
Woah
This is like showing Leonardo Davinci: Skyrim, Red Dead Redemtion, fallout and an unlimited amount of squares, and saying: "mix them" truly amazing work i can't wait to see the finished result!
You honestly should be invited to hermitcraft it’s really weird you haven’t received an invite yet :PPP
Soo cool man I wish mojang could add everything you did in minecraft tho
I literally cannot comprehend how every episode is better than the last. This is breathtaking...
I'm in love with the Founder's Statues. Also, I think I would belong in the Amethyst Faction.
In ep2 I bellive, it said ice castle in the snowy mounains. This might mean than there will be a possibly japanise or more likely a native american castle with a dungon network that made to house the end portal.
What's the plugin that makes the light more ambient, as seen in the video?
That forge is incredible!
I love this series! Always wonderful to see this world grow
Finally
Make something like a united nations of the USW
i bet mumbo jumbo could make the doors work! he does amazing things with red stone
Can you do the mountains next
imagin a huge roleplay server on that map that would be SOOOOO sick
Maby Can you make a Big hammer
every time i say "this is the best one yet!"
im just commenting for the algorythm
Will there be a stronghold?
TRIXYBLOX: SUGGESTION In the SNOWY MOUNTAINS you should MAKE a LARGE SHIP FROZEN in ICE
I love the USW
Loving the videos
Trixy in every new episode: this is the biggest update so far. Love it
The statues look really cool, but it looks like they are slaves or lower races to the dwarves
I can't wait to play on this map
verry nice build again but personly i would like to see more lushcave elemant's in there
for one of the colder biomes you should do a Viking theme with a Norse mythology curch and some Viking  boats it would be really cool! and there'd be a lot you could do you could also have small abandoned villages\monestarys from past raids
ELOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
When complete, is it possible to play this world with a friend, or is it only singleplayer friendly
i know its really random, but i would love to see a maze/labyrinth in the map. it would be dangerous if you get lost, but profitable if you escape. maybe a dangerous mob or town in there as well! if not thats cool! this map is so good it doesnt matter what you add it will be perfect
as always sooo impressive! ty for putting so much effort in those builds. these statuary look fantastic.
Amazing job, man!
I may have been following you for about 2 years now and you still shock me everytime with such great content... Your build skill- 100000/10 Your creativity- 1000/10 Your efforts- 10000000/10 Love you so much man, keep up the good work, love you💖💖💖
This cave puts Erebor to shame!!!
Salute to ur brain for these legendary ideas to ur hands to make these to ur eyes for looking at the screen for long times
Woah TrixyBlox you Really! Are an Artist in Minecraft
You're a genius man. Just a complete fucking minecraft mastermind
20:41 the ominous glowing eyes of the dwarf statue
Transform the end island
I have a question what will you do when you are done with the Usw and a new update comes out? Love Your build keep on going😉
Just amazing....
me not even owning a premium Minecraft acc nd dreaming bout playin in this word once its finished
You should really use the mod "Custom NPCS" to make the world and the cities more epic and lush. U know as an afterproject or something:)
You should make some kind of transportation vehichle (a special horse or something) scince the world is so big
Jejr
just 1 word : I N S A N E !!! awesome statues :D
Cant wait to play this World!
Dude you are insane
But... how... is this... POSSIBLE MAN UR AWESOMEE!!!!!
like hungry
Clap clap
Here's an idea (it would take a lot of work): add rings around the USW in the ocean that have different ocean biomes (not custom just vanilla) open ocean, kelp ocean, coral reefs, artic ocean; that stuff! just so that we still get some ocean adventures.
dude this guy is very good at bulding have never seen any body build this good
TrixyBlox always finds a way to impress us!
Your brain and creativity are a true world treaasure. Thank you for this.
Will you do the nether and end
You are the talent
Damn he's crazy
this is insane well done
Could you also upgrade an ocean monument and maybe do a small underwater city like Atlantas? 👉👈
USW more like und so weiter
Welp. Guess my plans to play this world with the Aether 1.18 port are a bust.  Anyway... Beautiful as ever!
Amazing bro😁😁😁😁😁😁
Dude, I LOVE your work soooo much!! Keep up the great work m8!
Absolutely amazing! This is way more elaborate than I could have imagined when I first saw this project.
I absolutely love the look. I wonder how long that would take in survival lol.
I tought that you couldn't do someting better than the mesa biome...you just prove me I was wrong!! This is incredible
Since we're talking about dwarfs in this episode how about elfs in the snowy mountains? 🤔
Wow, you are so talented.
wonder if there are going to be naturally spawned caves or just the custom ones
Hi im your fan and i want to say can you explain how to download finall map
Will USW be available for Xbox?
Not sure how I feel about The Warden just being a mob in basically prison cells. In my personal opinion it would have been cooler to have a whole dungeon for the treasures instead of the small cages of treasure. Imagining Dark medium/big hallways to walk through, With treasure vaults. And being careful of the Wardens wandering the halls as they search for you. Instead of just opening a door and killing them without stepping inside. It would in theory keep the same lore details, except they have a bigger place to wander in captivity.
this series was amazing
Man, this is SICK in the best possible way. It's insane how much time and effort you put in this project. I love all of the biomes, but those statues omg... They might be my favourite part so far
Here at 45 minutes <3 love your work mate.
I thought Dwarves were a bit more stocky in stature
I'm very much getting Khâzad-dum from LotR vibes from this.
This is so cool
I’ve Watched all of your videos 3 TIMES
so when will you release the whole thing? after world war 3?
Video idea: Make multiple of dwarven cities, make some smaller or ruined.
this is the craziest one so far fr
Me: Oh amazing statues! Also me: *Boss battle music*
I think u can add ores in the statue of the mine, and from time to time racks fall from the ceiling  so make some stone & racks parts on the cave city floor.
INSANE
This right here is breathtaking. That's theft. Give me back my breath right now.
This is sooooooo CoooooL😭😭
Absolutely gorgeous. And with the final view of the completed Dwarven City, I couldn't help but feel like singing.  "Far over the Misty Mountains cold, to dungeons deep and caverns old. We must away, ere break of day, to find our long forgotten gold."
Looks good man
hey I know you! You were in Home Alone right? One of the robbers!
Mojang watching these videos: write that down! write that down!
Won't those skulk blocks spawn wardens in the middle of the city?
The origins mod will fit this so much
You really should transform nether biomes and the end dimension too
little is known about the dwarfes
I really like your USW series 🔥 keep going 🙌 / can you add some new things for the new islands so this series won't end so soon :( + idea : sky islands like terraria ? I think it can match the USW lore so good 🔥
The amount of work you put in for this one map is astonishing, the addition of lore to it makes it even greater of an experience
Let's goooooooooooooooooooo!! ur back with more upgrades!! EPIC
Only 41 minutes after it was downloaded: i feel like a god
I mean, this map could be the best server if possible, imagine all the things you could imagine
Every video he looks more and more tiered, pray for this man he’s doing gods work. (Keep it up looks great
3:33 to skip the sponsorship
It would have been fun if u added a black market
Well this map be free to download when it's done as I would love to play this map when it's done
This map is like a nicely decorated cake that you don't want to eat
This Map would BE AWESOME with RLCRAFT or Some compatible mods from it
I love the fact you're even focusing on the Caves to make them as epic as possible in this already epic world! I hope you pay the same attention to the surrounding oceans as it would be dope to see an underground town/city, beautiful coral fields and sunken wrecks and ruins to explore
Please add a swamp land on the USW because it is going to be a huge addition because of the 1.19 update in which the swamp might be updated  Ideas for the 1.19 swamp: Build a swamp village with the new wood type, make a lake for frogs and maybe a frog statue, and most importantly the witch house  Like this so he sees this comment!
If mods are included for the map its gon be even more insane
Bro this is legendary
Respect
Bro, you’re insane. So talented. Keep up the amazing work!
I guess the next ep is gune be the ice mountains
HECK YEAH ANOTHER ONE!!! everything looks so cool! I live in fear of the warden tho.
TrixyBlox casual 250k like goal ez for the TrixyBlox viewers. No like actually I will buy that T -shirt
I think the Warden room should be a little bigger and have more loot but it's looking great anyway
Bro, I don't even get to breath before the next one comes out. Thanks a lot (no sarcasm)
Is there also something for the nether?
cool vid
I usually dont like creative projects because it is too easy, but this, this is in a whole other world. It is so cool, keep up the good work TrixyBlox!
This is truly the best Minecraft series imo
Trixy i think it would be a good idea including a resource pack so that you can add villagers to the markets  in  every biome so that they blend in :)
Bro I have been checking everyday to see if this video has been uploaded!
love ur builds
I'm sooo hyped for the final finished world 🤩
I get so excited every time i see another update for this. I will definitely be playing when it comes out
Finally
Amazing
Shadiversity ----> "CRENELLATIONS!!!!!!"
i will literally download the map and wont touch anything, ill just walk around and appreciate every single thing uve built on it cause its the most beautiful thing ive ever seen in minecraft, gives me goosebumps.so detailed and amazing, keep up the great work bro u have some serious talent. congrats for real!
My man becoming a legend
This content creator: finally i finished upgrading all minecraft biomes.  MInecraft development team: im finna end this mans whole career (ADDS NEW DIMENSION)
Are you gonna do the nether aswell
Wow awesome! if i will be sponsor i will be able to download this world?
This is better than the Underground Kingdom, the Kingdom did not show greatness, but here you have surpassed yourself, you have become more experienced in building, congratulations!  The only problem I've seen is that these dwarves have nothing to eat but fish.
the cave kinda reminds me of the dwarf cave with the dragon from the lord of the rings
Love these videos!  Don’t really care about lore or anything, I just appreciate the effort put into this.  It looks great though!
I am SHOOK at this update this is absolutely amazing i can't wait!
cringe-worthy white savior LMAO. L
🇺🇦❤️ chain ⬇️
And, There is my favorite!!!!!
did you all build that
I really love how you’re tying the world together. Building up the landscape and story in such a way that everything feels connected. Even some of the other biomes that you haven’t shown us yet(like the snowy mountains) feel connected based on all the history of all the other biomes.
Dwarfs!!! Fuck yeah!!
I didn't realize intell after I got done watching the video that I was the 4 person to click on it...
Amazing! Are sky islands next?
It's funny that usw in German means etc. Great work. I can't wait to download it.
19:98 Why dont you add the ,,Misty mauntains cold" music?
I love your cave builds so much!!!!!!
you could use shroom lights as giant glow berries.
Very rarely do I click on a video that fast. I'm so excited
will you update the world when new biomes come out like the mangrove swamp
I haven't played survival minecraft for some time and I'm waiting for this amazing map to release so I can start playing it. Btw, will you add human mobs  in your locations?
DUUUUDEEEEE  That's just AMAZING omg
Revisit this world with create, your imagination will go wild
This was brilliant kepp up the insane work
mother of god this is epic
nice!
19:00 But the warden disaperas underground after some time ._.
Hi Trixy, you are doing an amazing job for this project it's beautiful, I wanted to ask if for the next episode you will update the ocean with its various structures (temple, or the sunken houses) I can't wait for the next episode
That would be great if trixyblox's crew and forge labs do a 100 days on an upcoming trixyblox map ultimate survival world with some particalar mods depending on different biomes like,wild west mod in messa biome and some tropical animals in jungle biome,that would be great
yaaaaoooo
Hey trixy, i loved your caves and all but had a few questions Will you change the nether, and end, and do you plan on adding modded custom mobs called dwarfs and customer mummy mobs, and did you hear about the new 1.w18.2 command where you can spawn any structure anywhere
It would be super cool if you added like 1 or 2 underwater caves with a “secret” palace that holds some of the necessary materials for a conduit
Wow
If this world was made into a server, it would be awesome
God?!
🤩
This is such a great video! I love how everything turned out!!!
TrixyBlox I want to give you one advise: be proud of yourself and keep going! But idk or you are such a game/internet guy but please don’t become a emo
This map would be best with custom mods to fit its magical theme
I love you and your work but the subscribe thing and the like thing followed by hey go to this other channel and oh by the way heres a full minute from a sponsor was just so exhausting.  I know I can skip it but I want to be supportive 😢
Aren u gonna add a upgeades sea i relly wanna see it
BTW, 20:58 that is an among us troll :P
Please search for some kind of a custom npc mod so the usw feels more alive
Looks fantastic
Greatt video 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
How many time did you spend on it ?
Now that you have dwarves maybe put one of the other biomes made for some giants
Lol this guy is hell bent on making the creators of Minecraft look like they spent an hour making Minecraft.
nice
This is by far your best work so far in my opinion. Its a shame mc doesnt havr npcs to populate your world other than villager
I love the hobbit reference and I can’t wait to play this awsome map
Awesome build I love it ❤️😍👍
:0
I really liked that this felt like the underground kingdom build, that was my favorite TrixyBlox build, keep it up love the videos
This is a hobbit reference
This looks absolutely amazing I love every single video and the stories behind each biome
Probably my favorite so far
it is amizing and ireally like your vids
16 million block island.. is that the area or diameter
God dammmm I love dwarfs. Small beaded hard working builders and miners 💪 💪 💪 💪 let's flipping gooooo
Do snowy mountains and it should have a viking village in it
You know that the Dwarves are tough enough to beat the Wardens because their leaders can kill Orcs with their heads.
Someone needs to make a mod pack to fit this world!!!
I'm speechless :0 this is breathtaking!!!!
Dis is a beautiful build love all u do🤗
Are you going to upgrade the nether and end also
Anyone else get Erebor vibes with all the grand statues and dwarf theme?
If I could I would send this series of videos to the Minecraft’s developers.
I love these videos, the amount of effort and time that you put into this big build is amazing. This is even for us to see and wander around and explore on! You are truly a great creator, my best part was the parts where you built the statues.. They looked amazing. Thank you Trixy and keep up the good work. Although, I cannot play on this map because I don't have minecraft, this would be insane to be on. Love this!!!

Will there be custom mobs
just truly amazing how much detail you can put into one build. And the name. USW sounds like a giant ship it would be cold to see a ship named the USW in the world
🔥
Literally the part Ive been most excited about from the start was the cave & tunnel system!!! I cant wait to see whats next now!
Did I just see red stone lamps in the deep dark cities
I'm only waiting for the full USW to release cuz of how GODDAMN EPIC it is Love the work you've done man, keep it up
I like your builds really much. Please make more like this!
Wow, your buildings are amazing!!! And i really like the dwarves with their Architecture!
I wish I had the patient to create something like this I have the ideas I'm just impatient
You are the best inspiration for me to build in minecraft You are amazing And i don't have words to say about your build,It's AMAZING!!!
I really liked the amethyst roofs in the dawarven kingdom before you changed them out
Can you make and 50 minute video, so that it isn't that uncut of footage?
Amazing video as always. Tho maybe the copper faction should have a training grounds instead of a grand library. Where the eldest dwarves act as the masters and in charge of training the younger generation into fine warriors. Either way, amazing work.
Finally I was so excited
Plzz try transform end and nether
**EuOahyA noises**
What shaders do you use
The people who are currently working on Minecraft should hire this man to work on Minecraft
So the Warden became the Prisoner
People dislike this because they can't believe this a god builder like that and god builder like those exist
Hes the best builder ive ever seen!theres no way i could build like this
Cool
A‐
Bruh finish the series
The amount of work and build you put in to this is awesome
I’m glad you changed your skin 🤣 that old gradient shaded Robin skin wasn’t doing your style justice.
Ooh just saw this notification lol
This is my favourite build so far because I always used to have underground bases! Love it!
Trixy your every build of your is a god build you are never gonna be forgotten and you will always be the top imagine that someone is better then you bro
I love this project but i have a question: when the wild update comes there will be many new additions to the vannila biomes will you add those features to your biome recreation and will you update the world when a new update comes even if the world is done  Love your conten btw
But gold is such a weak metal…
The snowy hills biome and Tyga biome just be Canadians and Russians
Insane!!
Just because of the massive scale And Being build on 1.19 i can't play this Map Because my PC Is Slow 😭
Bro you're awesome. No one can descibe the feeling of watching these great builds.
It would be cool if there were a lush and stalactite mini group that got kicked out of the dwarven nation
i would join the copper faction
I'm excited for Snowy Mountain Biome!
Will the map be downloadable  ￼
are you going to add custom mobs
Im loving this series! Keep it up 😀
will the map be mod friendly? since it's just so insanely cool
Waiting for it to be for public I won't play but I'll watch ppl I just know this will be fire series
I would really like a tutorial on the dwarf statue with the axe and hammer. it looked soo cool
So many blocks so much effort bravo Trixie block
SOO COOL
This build was op
This made my day 🥰
The whole time I was thinking of “I AM A DWARF AND IM DIGGING A HOLE”
Are you also upgraidng the Nether and End
Wow
Pog
This is amazing please don't forget to put this on bedrock too
Phenomenal work, although I feel you could have used slightly more variation in the market place, to provide less of a sense of uniformity that markets generally have. All in all, wonderful build!
This is so so smashing! I cant wait!!!!
what about nether?
Using a grappling hook mod on this map would be very good
What a legend! He’s upgrading massive part of the game before it’s even released! Build looks incredible as always, keep it up man!
I'd definitely end up cheesing the warden 😂😂
Yoooooooo
OMG! I just saw that you uploaded this video and I'm so freakin' hyped on it! 🤩  Thanks for this truly amazing project!🙏🏼
@TrixyBlox I got it right on the community post, the inter biome mining network
AMAZING 👏🏽
Bro you are a ery good so can you a big use full Castal pls   ❤️❤️❤️❤️ form Bangladesh thank you
Sadly that this map will not be awaible on bedrock
love your content bro 🙏
This is so magnificent
please realese this on forge when its done
I would definitely join the Copper Faction. I didn't watch every episode of survivor for nothing
This project is just so awesome!
I hope the usw includes a transformed nether and mabye end😌
Cant wait to play this when its done! Buying a better Laptop so it can run smoothly! Keep it up Trix!
Next episode is gonna be the nether, i guess?
and i cannot even play this    FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
Yesss hipe this up buddys. I am so *_happppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppy_*
Can't wait to see the final result!
16:00 Hanging *Converyor* System lol
imagine everything in USW with connected textures...
me looking for youtubes comment like O.O
This is truly incredible, and I wanted to know,  did you get this world painter map to generate land under y level 0, or is it still at y level 0? at least for the USW map itself.
I can’t stop watching this channel’s videos
Will you transform the nether
after your are done, you should simulate civilization.
Something viking inspired in the taiga would be cool
Will you transform the nether
Wow,wow,wow.I like your buildings!!!👍👍👍👍
Will you transform the nether
Kind of a shame that I've stopped watching Minecraft for a while. It's been a few Months.
I really want to play this map but i also love building but anything i would build would just be nothing compared to what’s already existing in this map
Incredible job
is it for Bedrock?
I made ur jungle temple in my survival multiplayer world My friends were impressed and i introduced them to your channel and he made desert temple (ahh he is better at building than me)
I never thought you will do ancient cities and lush caves so soon. You are great. Can't wait to play this.😍 Good luck for future transformations!
where i can download it??
😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
I don’t know if it’s intentional but the dwarven city reminds me of Dragonsreach in Skyrim with the multiple levels.
the dedication this guy has is incredible
I would love to see Himalayan architecture (Buddhist temples, shaolin inspiration) for the snowy mountains
Will this include minecraft bedrock?
i just came across your video and i have full body goosebumps! this is amazing and i’m so happy to be apart of the journey!!
This upgrade was definitely one of my favourites!
Let's go
1.19 already out?
I love this so much thank you!!!!!!!!!!
What you're doing is amazing, but we both know that five years after you end this project you will need to do another version with the new updates and stuff
Will you be updating this map every update?
I forgor that this was gonna release today. Am glad because this came as a very pleasant suprise!
YES YES YES
I cant wait to watch some youtubers to play this map
You should definitely collaborate with a modder to make a special mod for this map it would be sick
just realese the map saussage boy!
Your original underground kingdom inspired me to make my own  It's not as good if it's even possible  But I'm proud of myself although I'm not finished
Cant wait for the snow biomes and stronghold😉😄 And thanks for all the time you put in to give us videos, respekt man✌️
Imagine a huge kingdom on this
This is literally amazing- you're amazing for making all of this !!!!!!!
Somehow reminds me of “The Hobbit”...
in legit annoyed how much this is being milked
Every single one of your builds is truly remarkable! I love watching elements slowly appear to form various objects within the build! I especially love your statues, those are also really impressive! Well done on this build, as usual, you've outdone yourself!
5:54 amogus?
early
Will you tackle the Nether and the End?
Can we all Take a min to realize that this is INSANE
How to play this Map please ?
would be cool if there were maps you could find in the USW island that lead to really good treasure far out in the 1.18 lands
I really appreciate what you put into this man, transforming everything in this world takes plans, creativity, and mostly time to build, the fact that you guys do everything from building filming and editing also keeping an update for us is amazing hard work Keep it up!!!  <3
😳
God dude you and Steph are so creative and talented it's actually mind blowing. Nothing but respect for this labour of love my guy. Keep up the amazing work <3
This is actual fire can't wait for this to be finished and released
When the world is done, will you do a world download?
GREAT vid!!!
I enjoy the content by liking the video. Do you?
Let's gooooo
I'm so incredibly excited mate. Can't wait to play this with me friends
noice
How amazing
Ouuu hell yes I’ve been waiting for this!!!
i love how you use world edit
You're so close to the finish keep going!
feels illegal to be this early
Definitely wasn’t sitting here reloading the page waiting
Yeeeessssss
I'm especially excited for this one man...  I've now completely ~ caved in ~ to being a TrixyBloxer for life ⚔
hi
So cooool dud
And we wonder why his videos take so long to come out
WOWWWWWWW
I love your builds and can't wait to see it all done.
These videos never fail to amaze me,I can’t wait to play this!!
the fact he got 1,7K likes in 5 minutes shows how much we appreciate the time and effort he puts in his vids. lets all support him as much as we can❤️❤️🔥
As a joke, you should hid a big hallway that looks like the back rooms some where on the map lol
How can i support you?
LESSSGOOOOO
Yo early squad
DWARFS?! ROCK AND STONE!!!
<3
is the USW FREE ???
POV: You wasted an hour just refreshing the page until you realized you are in a different time zone XD (it's 19:05 here)
Thank you for all the time you are putting into this only to entertain us!!!
I say this every time, but I think this might be my new favourite!💜  I definitely think Trixy & I belong to the Amethyst Faction! I also don't think I'd be brave enough to face the Warden head-on... I'll stick to stealth thanks!🤣
Amazing as always Btw im not a bot
188th
You uploaded your first USW episode and I immediately subscribed

First
Can't wait for what the USW would look like when it's finished! Anyways, once again a great work! Keep it up Trixy!
Trixy, I love this series! Is it possible, when you'll finish, combining all episodes into one BIG video?
You just made my day better Trixy, thank you.💙

AYYYY NEW UPLOAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4:23 for anyone wondering when the building actually starts
i knew it was ganna be caves
These videos makes our days better
What if you made a Cave With a villige hanging from the caveroof and yeties Living in the bottom 😉 (ive Said this in one of the first videos if you wanna know more about my idea)

Great 👍
a
I hope thisll be as nice to play as it is to look at
So what happens to the deep dark in this world when 1.19 fully comes out?
Can we appreciate how much effort and time he put into his vids!!
The amount of hard work and determination TrixyBlox puts in his videos is insane
yooo this is getting better every week
I’ve been waiting for this
I really love these types of minecraft videos
Can i when its finisht buy it and make it a server
You are the coolest person I know
as Minecraft quickly updates this map will update too, of course until the map is released.
For taiga do small village i love small villages and taiga biome too
at 16 million blocks, is it really an island?
🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️💜💜💜💜🧡🧡🧡🧡🔥🔥🔥
People won’t build new homes in this world they’ll just live in the ones Trixy built.
yo he forgot the swamp bio
52nd viewer 😁 unnecessary to say but yeh
I'm waiting for the world DOWNLOAD
Too bad it's not for beta😔.
Ive waited for this!
Finally!! LETS GOO
Very nice
I love these
cant wait for the next part keep up the good work
You posted an update about when the episode would come and I thought it would be any minute now then I realized south africa is 2 hours ahead of the uk
ill bet anything on him getting inspiration from zoras domain for the ocean monument
Ayeeeee 🔥🔥🔥
3 views...58 comments...yeah that makes sense youtube
hello everyone
Will it be available in bedrock?
Let’s gooooooooooooooooooo
SUBSCRIBE
Ngl I have never clicken so fast on a YouTube video ^^
finally another one
Hey there! Back again with my usual idea! I would love to see one small element of adventure maps added to this. In an effort to make sure that the transformation is appreciated in all of its glory, I’d love to see the end unlocked only after players have found specific artifacts held by each of the biomes. Only after the players have collected all of the artifacts can they unlock the end and get an elytra so they can finally get to soar over this beautiful creation.
Yaaaay, we're getting closer to the ultimate survival world
I love when you post sooo much😩
YES!!! More beautiful changes!!! ❤️
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOO
Thank you so much for being the best ❤️
