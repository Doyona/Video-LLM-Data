“I really hope nobody finds these diamonds” he says eith his coordinates opened up
WOW THIS HAS TO BE REAL, NO SCAM XD
I can Win this without Breaking the Crafting Table
He get chest full of diamond blocks But if he gets it he will die because for some fucking reason your considered a hacker when you have too much diamonds
I'm actually wondering if this is satire or not but it seems so

This smp is for bedrock or not?
Tp me my gamertag is Neonalfa1471
Outbreak the crafting table
Lol
you literally have anough (maybe i spelled that wrong) blocks. just take chest, crafting table, (even if there was no exit under the crafting table) and just build up, place crimson netherack thing and put these vine thingys on it, ull be still 1 short but just wait 1 minute and BINGOOOOOOOO 120 IQ (thats not 160 XDDDDD)
BRUH..
If it imposibble no one can escape this prison
YOU LITERALLY HAVE OTHER BLOCKS. MINE THEM.
The vine growing is an extra escape
Try me ill play that server later

I wold break every block
You also have 2 chests
BRO......... my ears are bleeding
Thanks for the diamonds ;)
i would've used the crafting table to build up and found the exit accidentally
thing is i would have break every block so i could build up and leave but i guess i would find out and win anyways
Copycat :/
Him: "To beat it, you *have* to use these blocks."  Also him: "So we don't need any of these blocks, just break the crafting table."  There's a word for that, I believe it's called cheating.
Indoneisa
*hi*
Bro just like let the vines grow?

He needed the chest
Wtf how am I supposed to know that one. If I was here and I'm secretly invisible and saw a hole the whole time. I will never join his server again.
this is fucking scripted
I created the server then i joined it says restart minecraft or reatart the tlauncher
You clearly said you have to use those blocks in the chest. Shutup
Use chest and other blocks
The first thing I would do was break every block so I could build out but I guess I would have won anyways
I would have build up with the crafting table-wait that was the key all along!
Is this on red or pink
I can't join smp
Noooob
Didn’t find it sad face is it a lifestyle red or pink
