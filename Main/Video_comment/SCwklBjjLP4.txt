tbh ive been watching the fellas since launch on youtube and ive never heard of any of these other podcasts they behind the scenes connections too..would have never known.
So did everyone just leave Brian and move to work under the fellas? Not saying I have a problem with it... Just didn't realise that alongside the Co hosts, producers like Elliot, Gio and Runner Jack left to go work for the club. Even guests like Flav 🤣🤣 It's crazy how everything can change so quickly.
working there must be the best job ever
There's too much going on. Prefer the podcast

This series actually inspires me to want to learn production and editing so I can eventually RUN to the Fellas HQ with my CV, begging for a job. I'm serious as well! ha
With the creative work that Chip does, could you film a BTS for the whole process of one project and release the video once the project has finished? I think this would be a really interesting watch.
