Bro jit had no jacket, no jeans on but when he came out the house he had a jacket, jeans and money. He had no money. He had shorts on and a fleet and a long sleeve shirt. Just crazy and he had no money jit was broke
He would just enough school outfit. He came out the house. He was just like that that don't make sense like how in the world. That's so weird. Are they already on the trip? I just don't know how he's getting his clothes right there. He couldn't have changed Coco's because he's going out on a trip.

Mabu has that special mix of skills that are separate from being a lyricist. Skills that artist usally learn the hard way and over many years of trials and tribulations in the music industry. He will be one of the greats of his generation,  without a doubt.

https://youtu.be/ZZ5LpwO-An4?si=UGiYYK453xvFipfh I invented the folk coz spoons still bend n I git a silver tooth I'll burn into an icicle to keep forever I cried my tooth in half to sedate my hatred immediately I began to speak of the curse of the gypsy "you should never speak of the curse of the gypsy" The Guiseppe 🦋 I bled from my left nostril and my left ear it run nice red, vivid fluid so quite fair  So Rasputin's language become eight broken bones as my dads does says it's slap stick  But hung on my silver hook  From left nostril it spins  Language phenomena From the left ear lobe it drapes more, so the peripheral vision isn't squinting my only friend I txt immediately said I should be dead of an annuersym I had a boyfriend once because when we met he showed me his I.D. I kept this secret like life or death; 6th break up he took enough to kill himself five times.  I found a bag in a tree of countless 100mg morphine and more 365mg muscle relaxants I stood at the foot of the bed for less then some seconds before the rage at the bottom of my feet made my lip twitch I did this once for three days then jigsaw held my fate over the cops over three days silence I'm above the law cartwheel becomes a tumble weed I saw the sun by this I mean the limestone univers; my revelation is "I've been that since that in France"*descent I vomit a single fine stream of liquid vomit like a shard of light as the son shines through it, then I'm proud I vomit the visual metaphor of a shard of light from the heavens very relative appearance I was proud  I had a bf once coz he was a trans he had to decide, but my decision to break up with him the 7th and final time after 15 of being back together and free of the ward over the unusual escape from suicide
EXIT UPON ENTER black&blue mask harshest of  I SEE THE SMILE  Vivid as blood vvivid as silver

This is the best music video I have ever watched
My son is 6 will be 7 in May . Well he loves getting on here and Spotify . Idk everything he listens to like a kid he bounces from this to that quick. Well to my surprise THIS is his favorite song right now 🥴 he was scared to tell me so my nephew did last night … why am I head bopping though ???!! Tell ya why , my boy he’s good some nice taste I will say . And he also listens to Billy Royce recently I wana say he said they was related . My baby boy gonna always be just that but he’s growing up and one thing my daddy did was always played music or let me listen to whatever was it all good probably not but for Asher rn it’s the beats that are catching him and I love that . He says one day ima play something, that’s right . ❤ Happy Friday to All Y’all 🫶🏼

‘For the time being I am putting a moratorium on staff participating in external events,’ [FTC Chief of Staff] Howard wrote. The message was sent to the head of the FTC’s major offices, including those who oversee all of the agency’s economics, antitrust lawyers and consumer protection attorneys. In a follow-up message two days later, Howard said that any staff who were scheduled for public events should cancel those appearances. ‘I want to make clear that for any situations where staff are currently scheduled to do a public event and thus need to contact event organizers to withdraw their participation, the message they should convey is that they are sorry they can no longer participate due to pressing matters at the FTC,’ she wrote. … The temporary moratorium on public appearances may hamper efforts to portray the agency as newly transparent.”); Christine S.

69 vibes… not s good thing either…. 💩 is whack
I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the chip go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the chip is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on chip . hail chip. hail chip . The spinning chip, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the chip spins, showing its lightly salt covered yellow skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the chip scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating chip. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of chip I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of chip I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. chip spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious.

So much great graphic design, so much suspense, so much greatness in this one video. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life.

I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. well pleased like chip. Thank you.

Have you guys heard of Lil Mabu going to the hood? Apparently he took a trip to the hood so he could make it out, since he has never been to the hood so therefore there has nothing for him to make out of/escape from. He did this for the sole purpose of people not being able to tell him that he had things handed down. He did it solo, on his own, nobody gave him extra help or cash of any kind. Rumors about him are untrue, but whatever goes around comes around, just like an echo sound. Rumour makers found out it was karma though, as Mabu achieved success. In contrast, Mabu also said that he could never snitch and make three hundred thousand dollars. Some people are hating on him on the internet, and he told them to get off and meet him in real life, in the hood, of course, where he said that. He also said that women are psychotic, and have the desire for his infant, but Mabu was 17 at the time of his trip to the hood, hence the women had to wait. Although he was 17 at the time, women desired sexual intercourse from him. At the same morning, before the trip to the hood, he woke up on some distinguished feces. Apparently, the only partner that he needs is currency en masse, including the fat stack. On a trip to the hood, he was a burning star like the roof of a Cullinan. Possibly he meant he was the sun. Mabu also knows that putting a bounty on his enemies' heads will cause their downfall, alongside that he knows the most favoured dance of his so called enemies, which is the "Runnin' Man". His so called enemies on the hood mistaked him for a cop, and due to that absurd error, Mabu's response was to start chuckling.
Bunch of 15yr old kids are fans of this 🤡
"i heard the opps favorite dance is the runnin man" HITS HARDER THAN DAD'S BELT💀
This hits

I hear a lot of controversy about this kid I've never really cared for his music I do listen to a lot of drill rap but I'm not a fan of this kid but what I am a fan of and what I do think is fuckingawesome is the fact that you got a white kid making drill rap but he's not acting like a tough guy he's actually pointing out the fact that he's actually not that's awesome for once somebody is actually famous for wrapping and they're not trying to pretend like there's some hard-ass or something it shows kids that you don't have to be a tough guy to be cool or fit in or even make this type of music you don't have to be murderer or a killer you can just be yourself like I say I've heard of kid before but I've never listened to his songs I actually ended up listening to this song and watching the music video because my ten-year-old son asked me if I could play the song for him I will always promote my kids listening to music like this for sure and I made sure I pointed out the fact to my son that this kid is not trying to look or act tough or like a killer or drug dealer he's just a kid who wanted to get into drill 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯

WE MAKING IT OUT OF THE HOOD WITH THIS ONE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon.The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

This is one of the greatest work from a bacon I have ever seen especially on 17:24. I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12.That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt.

This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. So much great graphic design, so much suspense, so much greatness in this one video. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon.

This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42. I am crying. This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you.

Ubriaco, mi scopo una troia Da quattro giorni, non so manco il nome (Scendo dal BMW, salgo sul Range Rover) Louboutin, le ho comprate con borchie Canada Goose, incappucciato la notte Completo DSQUARED, entro in tribunale C'è il tuo amico infame, lo guardo negli occhi Così sa bene cosa deve fare (Fare, fare) Lei mi tocca, tocca le mie collane Scemo, ho preso quindici coltellate E non ho parlato, giuro su mia madre (Giuro su mia madre) Pure il mio manager è stato arrestato Billie Commando, tagli in faccia a caso Ho il cazzo girato, fumo dieci grammi di estratto Pe-penso agli euro, fighe non mi distraggono Tasche piene e i DSQUARED mi cadono Ho due ferri, nei boxer son scarichi Li compro ma non so manco il calibro In un giorno spendo stipendi interi Se lo sa mia madre sicuro sv– In un giorno spendo stipendi interi Se lo sa mia madre sicuro sviene

New 69
When did Timothee Chalamet start raping bro
Jusst hooe bro dont do no six9 shit
bro tryna make it in 💀
Track is not bad by any stretch, and yeah it’s cool kid’s got a sense of humor and is finding a way to exploit what should be a hard pass into what’ll likely be mad lucrative for him (or like, more lucrative for his very heavily integrated family name in nyc, if you wanna be semi-petty)  But, I do gotta say if this shit is given the green light, then the entire drill scene shit you go and say even the whole rap game itself is “yeah nah I know in that song I said chop on my lap and I’ll shoot a cop no prob” or “fight me and see what happens” but irl this youngster has not never once been even remotely as tapped in on the real ass life or death type shit that rappers make songs about, and yeah a LOT of fools (now and even back then) were cap to one degree or another.  So TLDR; my question is, despite this kid saying he’ll slide your block but with his family business’s name, their bankroll, his 600k world famous Latin/Greek philosophy ass havin prep school watching him, does anyone here have a single worry in their hearts that lil mablu bustin shots out the window at you? Cuz I’d be willing to put money on the fact that it’s 0% chance (paying fools a bag to head hunt is different) look, long ass comment I know, I just like rap, especially shit that hits hard, and knowing this is being backed by actual street demons out there makes the whole scene seem like it’s cool to cosplay as a shooter when in reality kids got a 13mil family net 🤷‍♂️  Congrats to anyone who read all that. I just care about the integrity of rap culture (and I know, it’s not even my place to say shit really given my white as shit-ness) and I don’t see this shit helping that shit at all I see it turning into some shit you’ll see some 9 year old Korean girl start getting plays next n shit…
We gone make it outta tennis practice wit dis one!!
W song fr🔥🔥🔥
The bell hit harder than those slaves used to get hit by belt
Bro embraced the jokes PPL were making and absolutely killed it
WE MAKING
Ok hear me out I made so much fun of lil Mabu but if you listen to his to new song it’s kind of good. Also if you think about it rappers aren’t actually gangsters most of the time like Tupac he was actually a major in theater. By no means did he grow up rich but he wasn’t a gangster. One of the only rappers I know that was a gangster is easy-e
Bro this hit harder than my dad

Not the boo crew reference
Heard this a while ago and just found it.hiya hard asfff
Coolest white boy I’ve seen since yesterday
This dude reminds me of that one dude in that super rich family from California who went and joined a gang. They called him blue eyes. Look up the story. Living the street life ain't cool. I highly doubt this dude even understands the street code which is really dangerous. People living the street life are not your friends. Only the people who say "I don't want to live like this anymore" are your real friends. Someone's going to take advantage of this dude. You don't have to be a tough guy.
Happy 2 months anniversary
This type of shit so cringe
Man needs a feature with yeat
bro are you sure you're white your insane with that rap
I took a trip to the hood so I could make it out
This shit good
He said the n-word

Honestly, make cool fun songs and don’t rap about nothing or rep shit you not about. Don’t involve yourself in no bs. It’s okay to say NO to mf. Never be a yes man. If you not banging say that shit in your songs. If you from the white neighborhood and like hanging in the hood say that shit.

made another version of this music:  Yo, let's take a trip to the hood Where the streets are rough and the folks are good Gonna see some things that you've never seen And live a life that's real, not just a dream  The block is hot, the corners crowded But that's where the real ones go, so don't be doubting Got my boys with me, we're ready for whatever Making moves in the streets, we're birds of a feather  We hit the corner store for some snacks and brews Gotta keep our energy up for the things we're gonna do Got some dice in our hands, ready for some gambling Got some girls on our arms, this night's gonna be a rambling  The music's blasting, the bass is pumping The people are jumping, we're all just thumping This is where we belong, in the heart of the city Living life on the edge, it's gritty but pretty  The night is young, the stars are bright We're living life to the fullest, we're doing it right So come on, let's take a trip to the hood Where the streets are rough and the folks are good

Could never snitch all that pisses me off so many plp say they would never snitch they not a snitch but never been put to the test bc they would fold real quick, Ive had the FBI on me at 18 I've had the cops and drug task force on me years later I've never folded but most that say that would fold right away and be crying like a baby there plp that will snitch to get out of a couple days in jail
"put bread in your head and watch u crumble"🔥
Kids stay in school and stay out of the hood if you ain't living there. This kid giving off the wrong idea. A lot of solid people have taking A trip to the hood and never made it out. This kid obviously has connection (family members)with in the Law/justice system/government, it's the only reason he's able to move like that. You don't gotta go to the hood to make it happen on your own aint no type of opportunitys in the hood, but one and that's school. Read books you'll find better role models in there if you don't already have one. You can look up your community leaders within your communities for guidance. Gangsters look out to help in anything they can for their communities not destroy it
Mabu is my favorite rapper

yo! ain't getting tired of this
Bruh this dude
Dislike cause we saw too many black people and we don’t know which one to frame!
1:22 yeat???
After a couple of listens, I'm starting to realize this guy might be a genius. Or at least smarter than we all think. This whole production was incredibly well put together. Not only that, but his acting skills are really good. His tone of voice, the small mannerisms, facial expressions, and confidence on camera makes it feel like he was very intentional with how he wanted to portray himself. I found the irony behind the contrast of his suburban character and hard hitting type music to be hilarious. It was funny without being corny, and that's because his musical ability is impressive and enjoyable to listen to. It's the perfect recipe for a viral sensation. And the effort he put forth, I think, is underappreciated.
Bro said FUCK THE BURBS 😂 🔥🔥
This is better than years bells
Europe started nyways. European mixed with who now?? Only the only one who bet on himself to monkeys! BUCKLED IN. Or HOLDING ON LIKE A THREAD! He still let go!  She almost did too and I found out why women live longer than men! We all laughed nyways!

Bro reply to this. If you could never snitch
I’m not hating I’m just gonna say this as it is relative to hip hop history. There is no respect in the game for a white rapper. Hip Hop is was a movement in the black community that was essentially a vessel to make art and conscious work for blacks to speak on the injustices and disparities of growing up in a compromised area void of many opportunities. This is the epitome of what a culture vulture is and it’s really a shame because black history is getting erased left and right like it wasnt here in the first place. Mos def even said people ask where is hip hop going? Well, this is it folks. This isn’t even talent these are nursery rhymes my 14 year old sister can write.
Bitch I woke up this morning on some different shit 🔥🔥
LIL MABU GIT LITT 😝

John 3:16 KJV For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.       Matthew 4:17 KJV From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.    2 Corinthians 5:17 KJV - Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.

This shit is tough 🔥 🔥 🔥
This song go hard
jokes aside i went a high school that had a bunch of trust funded wannabe gangster kids trying to act good and sell drugs and flex guns where they had no business doing so. A couple of them ended up dying of drug addiction and a few ended up locked up right after high school. people who grew up with everything handed to them, living in rich ass suburbs, gated communities, they see gang life as a way to look cool and hard, likes it’s just some type of style or mask you put on. I don’t know shit about the hood and i never will, just crazy how young rich white kids see it as something to emulate to boost their own ego and act like they came from something hard when they didn’t.
Conethazine flow over pop smoke beats, this kid really is a jacker

That’s just stupid you go to the hood to get the pack to sell it, not bc your single mom struggling to support the family, etc. but just so people can’t say you got shit handed down. So risk getting locked up with grown ass men, killers instead of just asking your parents for money knowing it ain’t go hurt they pockets. Make it make sense

😂😂😂 yeah I may not know u but u sssSCREAM the stereotype so what u expect?? Don’t put shit on the internet if u don’t want to be judged. It’s only the biggest way to BE judged by ppl😂😂😂 ppl are funny, they don’t want to be judged but they make content like this or stuff that the biggest hypocrites or biggest judges of character of ppl without knowing that person, will judge.  Ur scrawny lil behind us only 17 but u think u can kick anyone’s ass with those tooth pick legs n skinny jeans hahahaha. It’s ok tho everyone ur age thinks they can take on Mike Tyson. It’s expected. Ppl r gonna see this comment n be sure to comment on this😂😂😂 it’s to be expected. hahaha. Cuz some ppl r gonna probably not like my comment I just wrote then they’re gonna comment me back negatively. even tho THEY don’t know me n will say rude things. But that’s ok, I expect it. It’s the internet. Who cares anymore. It’s s more funny than anything, I feel.

I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

The dancing cat, This made me tear up. How could such a cat do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin.

I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young woman. Thank you.

This guys a marketing genius…
Hello to those who read this, I take 1 minute of your time to tell you that Jesus loves you with all his heart and that he calls you to follow him, because he loves you so intensely that he is put on the cross to wash away your sins because he loves you more than anyone in this world and Jesus Christ has a plan for you and know that he is coming soon and this world of depravity is over the point of disappearing  Jean 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me  jesus is the only way *not buddha *not Muslims * not spiritual *and even less your Sunday evening yoga that will save you  John 8:58 ► Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am   Exodus 3:14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you..

This shit fire ay mabu if you see this shit tryna make a song my new shits hard bro not as hard as this tho
making it out of the castle with this song
i get it. its a good song. but being a rich kid from a nice neighborhood doesnt mean your parents just give you money. i know plenty of people whos parents are rich and they dont give much to their kids. sure, they can stay at a nice house and will most likely have food and be safer but they dont give you any more money. maybe 100 bucks here and there not much more than what someone who makes working in the hood would get.
that transition when he walked outside was cold
“You did diddly daddly didn’t you”😭
you play LoL?
my favorite line is put some bread on your head you start crumbilin
disss it fs

Hope this is all worth it in the end
I get the Book Crew reference 😂
в этом что-то есть
Homie tryna be a gangster too hard. You don’t needa throw the act up dawg, you have talent, why make the style corny cuz it ain’t genuine? And if this is what you’re aimin for, to be a scary dude, why? Bein scary ain’t fun man. It’s stressful. Bein fly on the sidelines is where it’s at, maybe your ego wants you to be “hard” tho. Whatever the case, best of luck.
Sound like comethazin
I swear to God you kids HAVE to pack heat these days because you would just get beat up everywhere you go if you didn't lmao no wonder yall are so mad these days, look at these weird ass gay rappers yall have to listen to. I'd be mad too lol

This dude so corny - as a white man who grew up in the bad part of town on section 8 single mom several siblings ebt to eat etc and had all black friends and grew up in that environment I can really spot frauds .. and this clown is no different than slim Jesus, 6ix9ine etc. & he makes white guys who actually have that past & history have no credibility- FUCKIN CLOWN who profits off of real life struggles of inner city families SMFH

Bro why does he always have something with a kid
wait "u went to the hood to make it out" wow
AYO NATO PROD
Wha this was made yesterday
White 69
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
He really just pursued his educational prowess on us 🔥🔥🔥🔥

MABU ON THAT DEMON TIME 😈
ONE TRIP GOD-JESUS Because of the long distance to the pickup point I like to limit my visits to the heap I put out my garbage on to one trip. Today I had four parcels and I prayed LORD how am I going to make one trip? (pan, box, bag, banana tree) I put the box and the bag atop the pan (upside down) on the tree branches and pulled them along – one trip! JESUS always has an answer and He made only one trip to the cross on Calvary for us for all past, present, and future sin. Give all your garbage to JESUS; He disposed of it all in just one trip.

lil mabu jus hits diff
🔥🔥
Not the boo crew script 😂
HE did dat♡
"I took a trip to the hood so I can make it out" is a comment on modern poverty that shows how the rich mock the poor by lowering themselves to their level and humiliating them. Just because lil Mabu is successful doesn't give him the right to mock those who have struggled and haven't made it out of the hood and are less successful to them. Lil Mabu uses his economic worth to mock and humiliate those of lesser means.
THIS KID ON ANOTHER FUCKING LEVELLLLLL
🔥🔥
