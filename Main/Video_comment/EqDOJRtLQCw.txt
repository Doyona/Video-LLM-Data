Here after Darby finished climbing Mt. Everest
AEW❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🙏🙏🙏
Lol u thought that's Professor from Money Heist 🥴💀
Darby allin is the best just wait and see
Darby’s promo skills are nowhere to be found yet.
It was so obvious that he was going to miss Sting.The emotion is palpable.
Darby allin and sting have a great run together as a tag team and it cool that they won the aew tag team championship together,good moment
1 out of 10 people die of allitude sickness
he need new mentor....maybe DDP
darby fan!
Darby you are my current favorite wrestler.
😢😢😢 please don't die
I literally zone out every time jay white talks!!! Just drags and drags ZzZZZZZzzzzZz 🙈🙈🙈
He’s going to become sting with the attitude and promo. Nice marketing
I love you Darby Allen i hope you succed in Mt Everest
I do like Darby but I feel like his character is one step away from doing an arena shooting
I hope they finally start to push Jay White as a singles in the main event scene, he had soooo much momentum coming from NJPW I couldn't wait for him to sign over here, his in ring work is brilliant his mic skills are second to none I mean dude is champ material but they have to build him back up and get rid of the side show juice he needs that strong leader type like in NJPW
Darby new partner should bd irange cassidy
1:13
Im gonna miss my childhood hero sting so freaking much man its sucks but Darby will take the torch 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Logan paul ksi
Aew prime
Jay White "hello my name is korg"
Darbi is not coming back. Mt Everest is deadly
Darby better not coffin drop off Mount Everest.
Darby must find 2 new partners to be his allies for tagteam fights.
Back to being an unknown..
His physics looks better
Bro reminds me of Jesse Pinkman
Been watching Sting since I was a kid. Hope to be watching Darby for years to come with my kid.
Suprised they even have that many people there lol. You can hear the echos from the chants with how empty it is.
What happened to Aew? I watched like the first year or so and recently been watching here and there but it’s changed a lot.
Darby is really getting annoying. Too bad he is a babyface and we can’t boo him lol
Everest legit has frozen ppl on it and sliding down this last match is going to be his last unfortunately
A clown
Idk why but Darby reminds me of Jesse Pinkman
Jay White sucks
Turn Jeff heel and turn on Darby
Turn Darby and Jeff into heel partners
You are thinking you are the beauty and Mount Everest is the beast????? Wishing you the most breathtaking adventure as you conquer Mount Everest. Stay safe and enjoy every step of the journey, sending you strength and courage as you embark on this incredible accomplishment. And blessing you a safe return. You perform too many dangerous dangerous stunts why are you saying these things???...........Sting's match was awesome, Your jump from the ladder was truly wonderful and brave... Absolutely outstanding performance Sting, Darby, Nick and Matt.....
Sting, you are an absolute legend in the world of wrestling. Your incredible talent, dedication, and many iconic moments have left an unforgettable impression on fans like me. Thank you for the countless memories and for being an inspiration. Your legacy will forever shine bright...............
Darby come back alive champ we need you at AEW.
Darby Allin is crazy but still I love him one of my favorites in AEW but he needs to take a break after everything that happened at Revolution absolutely yes 🔥🔥
Whaaaat???🤔😤😤😠
Stay alive darby  please im gonna pray for  him love you
Jay is such a treat on mic, wtf 😩
W DARBY ALLIN
Dear Darby : please stay alive
So why is Darby and Jay white wrestling ? Clearly no reason just because Tony wants to make a match
🎉darby joing bang gang
I don’t get the point of climbing Everest. You walked up a snowy rock and didn’t die. Wow
I didn't know Aaron Paul had a brother. Them two look and sound alike, trippy
“You don’t need a criminal lawyer. You need a criminal lawyer.”
Did darby allin say on aew big business is his last match?
I mean you don't have to go climb Everest...not like you'll be the first, it's a junkyard for the rich.
Darby will most likely die on mount everest. Most people do. Thats nice darbys last match was teaming with sting. RIP.
Darby Allin is a great wrestler, thank you <3.   If you have the spirit to jump off a ladder onto a glass sheet with steel chairs, then you have the spirit to climb Everest.
Hes not actually climbing Everest 😂
No one cares about Darby Allen bye bye
good. hope you stay there
✨💜💫
"You can scissor our daddy ass" best quote😊 ever
IS that vitaly??
Idk if I wanna meet this brawd mount Everest he's bout to climb that's  personal
May God be with you Darby🙏
Darby is the only reason i tune into A.E.W anymore
darby tag with hammerstone or mansoor
This is to wild like that Ultimate Warrior promo. This guy is legit one of the reasons why I liked AEW from the beginning. I hope he does it and it satisfied after. Please slow down in the ring after 🙏
I'm confused so is jay white a heel?
save this for ppv
this is kinda sad , hope he actually comes back from the mountain
I dont support in people going to MT Everest, We already know whats up there, no need to Risk your life for it.
Darby is legendary
You need to come back bro! Go concur a mountain and make sure you come back in one piece
Waiting for the next video...Darby Allin does coffin drop off mount Everest
Darby 🥺🥺
What was that whisper about?
Protect Darby Allin at all costs. 🙏🏾💯
The nice thing about climbing protocols is they they’re generally designed to protect and save lives.  AEW protocols seem to be based on different priorities.
That boy finna die
Just don't give him a mic.
I'm worried because if he reaches the top of Mount Everest, he might decide to jump off it  Through 4 glass panels and on a pile of chairs of course     And he might survive
Let’s go Bang Bang gang
These two should be in the main event
They did put the rainbow color mix at the end which was the OG dynamite graphics.
First of all. Sting did not get a propper send off. That was a garbage match with garbage minded opponents and they did stupid crap that embarrassed the legends that were there and watching that bullcrap.  Secondly Tony Khan needs to put an ankle bracelet or a shock collar on Darby Allin for his own good because Darby Allin is a frickin mental case.  And thirdly I do not want Jay White on the microphone its frickin annoying.
Ugh.  Now I'll get emotional over Darby in Mt Everest
Darby could definitely die from this bro that’s fucking crazy. I know he’s a stunt man but fucking hell.
jay white is money
Welcome to the Nepal🇳🇵🇳🇵 Darby
Bring back sting
Climbing Everest. BEAST....
Seriously he is the only wrestler that is actually cool .and is relevant outside wrestling besides cena and rock.pl3ase dont die darby.
Excellent segment
I hope Darby survives Mt. Everest. He’s got balls for even attempting climbing it.
Now is the time for Darby to get the big push to the top of the company
Jay White’s hilarious 😂
What channel will this be on please like tnt snte it and what day hste watching all Aew on utube
Bang bang scissor gang is grade A dog shit, anything Jay white touches he ruins. The Acclaimed have been red hot for 2 years straight since joining Jay white they have sunk
I know Darby had a really tough life over the last several years. I really hope and pray he's not in the mind set of what he used to feel and that being around Sting really changed him. Everyone loves you Darby, be safe brother. Come back home and kick some ass
🤔 new nwo? Just like sting joining the wolf pack, and still did what he wanted but, but semi had their backs. I’m old school
The real Cero Miedo.
that was painful to watch
When your only homie graduates and leaves you in high school 😂😂
I don't know why, but I feel like Darby is depressed and wants to die. I hope I'm wrong and he continues doing good things in AEW
Amazing. This weirdo app will show clowns like this thing maim themselves for the entertainment of *bleep bleep bleep* (yeah that's you pubeless nobodies) yet I can't say certain words. Welcome to the most twisted, perverted and unintelligent era of the world that ever existed.
They act like Darby didn’t wrestle in AEW before Sting
I hope they do Darby right, and don't drop the ball like they did with Wardlow & The E did with Solo!
He’s sacrificed so much but he needs to start taking care of his body ❤he also reminds me of Jesse from Breaking Bad.
In a time in human history now when apprenticeships are being laughed at I respect what Darby and sting did..Darby could have lone wolfed from the gate and sting could have said “You’re on your own kid” RESPECT to these men..Especially Darby not loosing himself when he lost Gigi..Respect..💔♥️🫡⚔️⚜️🦾
If Darby survives Mt. Everest, he seriously should become a World Champ. Since day 1, Darby has been 1 of the best parts of AEW.
Boys are abit overtanned
Nick Wayne and Darby!!!
"A distraction that Stings quite a bit" Sting showing up at WM and costing Roman Reigns the title in a bloodline rules match the same way he showed up and helped Ziggler win against the Authority at SS "confirmed" Lol 🤔💭💯🕵️‍♀️🤼‍♂️🏟️🤯🤯🤯
Jeff hardy fit goes crazy
Derby is stick man. He should eat steak.
Darby Darby Darby
This man is the heart and soul of AEW! He is 💯 a Main Eventer. Give him massive opportunities and continue pushing him Tony Khan 🙏🏼
Manifesting Darby to be the next Green Boots when he goes to Everest. 🤞🏻
Darby Alin is one The Greatest AEW superstars bro. This guy is World Class 🐐♟️☠️
"I can't replace the Icon Sting"- Darby Allen.
Darby better keep tht bat in his gimmik
I hope Sting is there in the end when Darby wins the AEW title
Darby is to AEW what STING is to WCW. Franchise
We gonna miss sting man
Darby is the heel here. Jay came out, gave him points on what he could’ve done better in his match, show empathy towards darbys physical and emotional state, offered to hang out instead of fight. Darby then whispered some sort of threat in his ear and almost assaulted him with a bat. Smh
Darby should do us and him a favour and retire with Sting
coffin drop off mount everest?
What next? A year off. Boy take some crazy bumps.
Darby: "Are you done Jay White? Are you DONE?  Jay: "I'm done" 6:36 😂😂😂😂😂
God luck Darby ❤👌👍👍
❤️❤️💚💚🤲🤲🤲🤲🇧🇩💯I want to go to that place, where I can live in peace and sleep forever in peace.  If necessary, I can sacrifice my life like a hero to maintain peace in the whole world.  I want to go to such a country.  And so I think, only America knows how to value such people and has been doing it in the past, is doing it now and will do it in the future, God willing.  ❤️❤️💚💚🤲🤲🤲🤲🇧🇩💯
Darby is probably one of the most technical gifted wrestlers in AEW its his time to step out of the shadows and into the light
I wanted to slap Jay so badly when he said 'Sting is gonnnne' in that singsong voice lol. The guy is a very underrated heel for sure.
What no way I didn’t know he was homeless how did aew   Sing him then
FACE
Darby, Darby, Darby, Darby, Darby 🤘🤘🤘your the man brother! All the best man🤙
Darby scissors ✂️ hands..😂😂😂
Sting is retired and Sting has passed the torch to Darby Allin! Darby Allin has Sting’s Baseball Bat to deal with Jay White and The Gun Club and they will have a match at next week episode on Dynamite
Man he casually said he might not make it from mount Everest like he is forshadowing himself being in danger and know he not coming back
Darbs, may whatever God you worship be with you. Don't die!
Why climb something to possibly die of hypothermia? Dude really likes his death wishes. Hope he reconsiders but good luck
Best wishes for a safe and successful ascent of Mount Everest! May your journey be filled with strength, determination, and awe-inspiring moments.
Jay white accompanied by those clowns takes away a lot of credibility
Good Luck Darby Allin ❤
WHERES DARBY’s SHIRT FROM??
DARBY ESTA QUE SE CAE DE BUENO 😍
What's next for Darby?  More than likely a serious injury.
Speaking from someone in a time warp from the 80's, is this the same Sting? Like Sting vs. the Great Muta? Watching it on the superstation WTBS?
Aew dead but this video got 200,000 in a day not including every other video from yesterday plus they tv rating idk something dead don’t usually generate anything if you ask me
Darby I hope you make it back stronger than ever, but it was an eerie promo. I’d hate for him to foreshadow or speak something into existence, let’s hope not. I couldn’t stand Darby when aew started, but he grew on me and puts his body in the line. He definitely has passion for the game.
😮😮
Doing right by Sting by having a meaningless bump off a ladder through glass hahaha what a joke, praise by fools
He has the same voice and cadence as Jesse from breaking bad
Dead ass crowd
This felt like a goodbye, hope he doesn’t die damnit
Thank you sting 😢❤
Survival rate of Everest is 96%, that jumps to 99%+ the more recent you go. Remember Darby’s just some rich guy paying the indigenous folks to carry him over corpses
AEW getting a lot more views on their YouTube vids compared to others. I hope this translates. So happy Okada is in AEW !!
Lame
Give him the world title already
Mount everest literally just had a avalanche a week ago. Horrible idea for Darby allin.
Sam Smith
Darby deserve a World Champion
Bad feeling about this one... can't lie...
I feel super weird about this like a bad feeling but I hope for the best sincerely
Darby, you better come back from Mount Everest! you are an amazing wrestler and i hope to see you continue your career!
The only one pilar right there!
TK needs to send someone else on that My Everest trip. It would be so dope for Darby to be about to summit and then Jeff Jarret runs out of nowhere in wrestling trunks and lay him out with guitar.
Does Darbs PLAN on not coming back from Everest? or does he just plan on doing some stupid death defying stunt?
Dides 100% not coming back from Everest.
Last. Pillar. Standing.
I’m so happy for you Darby for saying the name of Mount Everest proud to be Nepalese. Always welcome to Nepal Darby
Darby sounded like Sting after White spoke
“ then you came to aew and did what “ lmaoooooo
This kid is a total Jay-brone.
Hey TK.  Document video crew with Darby Allen when he attempts to climb everest
Still prefer the Goth Switchblade look
Darby allin and hook should be partners now that'll be awesome there both great wrestler s
You will conquer Everest Darby. No doubt about it. 😊All the best out there.
Darby Allin’s sole purpose in life is to go out in a chaotic blaze of glory! Mount Everest, are you kidding me?!!?
Please don’t die, Darby 🙏🏾
Am I the only one extremely uncomfortable with his saying that he might die? Like, for the next two months we all have to just fucken *wonder* if Darby Allin is still alive?
Bullet Club Gold 4 life
Welcome to Nepal Darby🇳🇵
What did Darbs whisper to the switch blade??
Welcome to Nepal🇳🇵(Mount Everest)🙏 you’re safely back, that’s my wishes for you and request to god🙏🙏🙏❤
Darby just fcking cooked Jay White as bad as MJF did, this dude is totally done for me, I don't know how I am supposed to take him seriously anymore between all the goofy comedy promos, losing to a 1 legged MJF and getting verbal annihilated by 2 of the 4 pillars lmfao
Praying for Darby,hella people died trying to climb mt Everest and only few lived to tell the story
Sorry Darby , dads left you to spend time with his friends at the retirement home   Let Sting rest and enjoy his retirement
Dude you're from Washington state ... climb Mt Rainier first and then see about everest.
00Darby
We love ❤️ you in Wilson NC Darby Allin I was at your Revolution match Sunday first time watching you live ever you're the reason I started watching AEW Dynamite please think twice about this climb.. Sting was my icon. Don't let Switchblade beat you to a pulp. I'm a die hard fan of yours.
Damn bro, I literally dont know how I feel about this tbh.
I love you Darby allin please be safe on the mountain Everest all of us need you back here in AEW in one pieces alive.......
he should have a storyline where he feels like an abandoned child and act out against his opponents.  culminating to a title shot one year later with Sting in the crowd.
U know I kinda see a passing of the torch from sting to Darby and I wouldn't be shocked if Darby embraces this new ride and he grabs the trenchcoat he already has the bat paints the other side of his face as stings and we have ourselves a new sting. That's where I see this headed in due time
You know what would be cool, if he planted an aew flag and a sting flag at the top
Prayers sending to bring u back safe
Mt  everest  wtf why ?
Jay White is MASSIVELY overrated. Probably the worst right now. He got exposed vs MJF. He is a talented tag guy as FTR was able to show but they make everyone look good. Juice outshined him as well & really should have his spot. His ceiling is mid card. Period. Not even upper mid. He should NEVER hold a world title with this gimmick & I can see a TNT title perhaps, or AEWs Intercontinental Title.  I wouldn't even get mad if he carried RoH for awhile & developed more. He can lay claim to a World Title technically & maybe be appeased. Not the AEW title though.   Meanwhile the BBSG makes no sense. He is dragging them down. Terrible idea.   Darby is an upper mid, lower upper in THIS company at best. I'd give him an AEW title like Mankind as a thank you for loyalty & the stunts but in reality it's NOT actually going to put the butts in the seats & we all know that.   MJF has a feud lined up with him over the fact that he was able to defend the titles 2 on 1. Darby ran away. Some "pillar."   However they have to give the title to Adam Cole first, Swerve Strickland before that, & quite possibly Wardlow turning on Cole before MJF takes his loss back from Wardlow. So that's how I see it going  Swerve to Cole to Wardlow to MJF to Darby. Then FFS give Jay Lethal a chance. He deserves better.
Darby has made me a true fan!
darby was there for muta and now sting.  This man is good, and im glad it is seen.
Hopefully he retires ! No talent
I'll tell you what's next for Darby. Retirement as well. By age 30
🏆🤼‍♂️ Love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, soul, mind and strength, and love your neighbor as yourself, Jesus said. And to turn from sin and follow Me ❤️📖nkjv 🧎🏻‍♂️🙏😑🕊🇺🇸🕊 🏆🤼‍♂️
Darby has grown so much as a talent under the the guide of Sting. When he debuted, he could barely promo. But look at him now, not only cutting solid promos, but switching gears mid promo effortlessly. He went from being emotional and saying goodbye to ready to rip Switchblade's head off in a mere second. And he did it well.  God speed Mr. Allin. Hope you have a successful climb up and back down, and make it back safe. AEW needs you, you're currently the only pillar left standing.
Why is AEW audience so little?
I wish Sting wud tag along for Mount Everest with Darby
Darby goes back to being a mid carder. Sad but true. Darby's done the main eventing because of Sting not because of his own talent.
Hey JW if you Man enough . How about one on one with DB at Atlanta
I hope Allin gets the world title ASAP and he deserves every bit of it
Darby you better not  take yo ass to mt Everest but if you do I hope you make it back in one piece Bro frfr
Darby without Sting is like the other members of Ravens Flock.... He's just there. Unremarkable.  Without Sting, this guy's a Lodi
"I was homeless" ehhh Darby, you chose to be homeless in your car. Nice try at trying for the sympathy though.
Seeing Darby without Sting feels so sad. 😢
respect for darby
Everest is 95% death 💀 , what's he UpTo?
We hope you come back from Everest Darby. Thank you for all you've done and make sure to kick some ass against Jay White
Is it part of Darby's gimmick of whispering things in the ears of his opponents to throw them off? If not, it should be.
Those tears, those are joy tears :)
What a great piece of business this was. Wow
We all know Darby wants to climb mount everest only to jump from it
So Darby is also raiding Becky’s closet?
Well come to Nepal 🇳🇵  Darby ❤️❤️🌹🙏🙏🙏
Good luck Darby, can't wait to have you back.
Adam Copeland should be Darby's new partner.
Oh geez.  God I Darby makes it back okay.  He's been one of the pillars of AEW, since the beginning.
The way jay cut promo is so mesmerizing
Is Darby going to jump off Mt Everest and livestream it?
I would mind Darby adopting some version on Crow sting for a heel run
Hope darby makes it through mount everest 330 people have died climbing it many of their bodies are left up there frozen forever super risky climb
I like that Darby has been bequeathed Sting's bat. That's a nice touch.
Jay White is really not that good on the mic.
Jay White is 🔥on the mic 🎤 Darby was great here too.
Still not a fan of Darby Allin.
We love u darby
Will pray to Bhagwaan pashupatinath about your safety darby . Come visit nepal ,  come explore real heaven. God bless you darby ❤❤❤
Darby Allin is the next owen hart if you know what I mean
Darby allin cant cut a promo has no charisma
Bro i miss sting already
Where are the real wrestlers I remember. Little boys everywhere.
Here's your new tag team partner... STUUUÙUUUNG!
Bang Bang Scissor Gang🎉🎉🎉
jay white is getting so comfortable in AEW. sick promo
Is Jay White suppose to be a heel or a face?
man in the crowd:he won genius
Darby needs to be aew champion for sting and sting father and all his fans and family friends too he is awesome
I love that Darby gets to carry Sting’s bat. He gets to carry the torch while still being his own man. Get home safe from Everest dude. Take some awesome pics for us all, then come back and wrestle your heart out. 🖤
So is bullet club gold face or heel
Smark: Climbing Everest is easy nowadays  Mother Nature: Let me pull Sting's bat off of Darby Allin's frozen corpse for you!  Mankind Never Learns
GOOD LUCK DARBY.....
Darby you are the man
Surprised TK is letting him climb a mount Everest, sounds pretty stupid.
Mount Everest Pakistan go on darby
Darby is a fearless fighter
Whoa man! Mt. Everest?! Bro, you might die!! I mean I know thousands climb it a year but still! Darby is such a daredevil!
Darby bouta coffin drop off of Mt Everest😭😭
Why does this promo feel as if Darby is saying goodbye for real?!?! AEW? You keeping check on Darby's mental health for real? Please, Darby, know that you are loved by many for real. Please, just take care on Mount Everest, and don't plan anything stupid. Please. If Sting meant a lot to you, then so do you for a new generation of fans.
Darby, stay away from Mount Everest. Don't climb it. Live your life.
I don’t care what company it’s in but one day I desperately want to see a Jay White/Cody Rhodes feud
Besides Mjf its Darby Allin for me in Aew hands down. That coffin drop is a thing of beauty idk why nobody thought of that.
Darby's about to reach the summit but is exhausted. Heavy snowfall starts to pick up. He starts to hear a guitar riff and thinks he'a hallucinating and then all of a sudden IT'S STINNNGGGG
Why do this sound like a goodbye
I can't wait for jim Cornette to react to Darby climbing mount everest 😅
People keep forgetting that Darby was the TNT champion before sting got there and had a few wins under his belt and didn’t need sting. Help increase his popularity but he didn’t need him, with all due respect I mean no disrespect
You don't have to lose a match to put someone over . especially losing a retirement match. Nobody would had gained anything pinning sting. Sting put Darby over by teaming with him.
Jay white vs darby aliin will be amazing match instant classic ❤🥰😍🤩👍👏
Soebody stop him from mt everest
6:40 Darby cooked this boy in 30 seconds...with the TRUTH
Darby will breathe with the switchblade but it's kinda cool the icon sting left him the black baseball bat
lezzgoo darby <3
Mount Everest# If he dies! He dies!
Two guys that weigh about 165 pounds😂
Welcome to Nepal ,Darby
Altitude sickness, avalanche, and negative degree weather.  Thats a battle
Cornette is right. Darby is nothing but a flashy indy spunk🤣🤣
White is awesome
I’m gonna be low key pissed if he does die. He better fucking not. Jk 😂 but no all seriousness though I hope makes it back from the Mt. Everest.
Cool. A company pays you so much money, put you with a legend, to help boost your career, get you extra attention and spoon feed you titles and wins,  just for you to willingly risk your life climbing a mountain. AEW could release/fire Darby and I don't think anyone would really care... Or at least wouldn't care longer than a month. I wonder when Darby Allin will decide to grow up?
This sounds like a man saying goodbye. I think he might intend to die on Everest. Someone needs to check on him.
Fkn boring AEL!
Wait why do they have 3 of the same belts?
Darby should tag team with Mark Briscoe
Darby is nothing without  sting
Wasnt bang bang scissors gang face?
Darby’s is going to climb Mt Everest?! Plz be careful man.
Darby got into his moms closet
ello
This might be a really good chance to give darby a solid world title push, he's got the crowd behind him a solid amount
Jesus please be with Darby and protect him amen
Darby is sting reincarnated he has to keep stings legacy alive even doing the famous sting no sale 😢
🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵
don’t die darby
Xin chào
Sometimes it seems that dude have a f'n death wish or something. I admit, Allin fears nothing. But i don't know, man. So many people died on that mountain (even people with a lot of experience in climbing) And they are still there because it's too dangerous bringing their corpse away. That tag match was good, and i'm all in to give props to Sting for his amazing career, and i'm glad for him he went out on his own terms. But i hated that glass spot. Not because of the glass. It wasn't even part of the finish. It lead to nothing. That risk seems worthless. Thats not a in ring story a professional Wrestler would do or tell IN the match. Like i said, i'll give him credit cause he fears absolutely nothing. But in my eyes, that guy isn't a wrestler, he's a stuntman. But maybe i'm tooo old for this 😂
Hopefully Darby not gonna get any Injured after match with Jay White because he need Climbing that mountain without any injury
I need help pls rate "bounce house of tampa llc' 1 star on google  the guy is racist... pls AEW Universe !!!!! One person can make a difference  thank you for helping
Tony khan needs to stop him from climbing that mountain.  😂😂 bro this speech sounded depressing. I don’t like the vibe. Someone stop the guy. Get Dave meltzer out here 😂😂😂😂
How pathetic he gives up the tag belts because sting quits he could have got himself another partner
This isn't Atlanta, it's Duluth
This was the best promo by Jay White since coming to AEW.  Good luck on the mountain Darby. I hope you film that coffin drop.
Please don't die, Darby
Nothing, time to retire
Why bring roh title in aew
Darby should  show sting that he can  do it with out him
He shouldn't of given  up his belt because of sting mot there have faith in yourself &be grateful 🙏 that he's  got a belt it not easy to get a belt
He's not dying. In 2024, the groups they have now and technology is great.
Darby you are the greatest part of AEW alongside Sting. Go for Everest and I’ll be rooting for you all the way through.
a lot of wasted talent there
First of all he needs a new shirt looks like he escaped a bear attack 😂
Since Sting has retired, does he have to change his name to "Stung"?
Never seen him like that he such a legend and so emotional
If he dies on that mountain then TK is the biggest idiot ever. Why let your talent, LITERALLY, risk his life? This isn’t some thumbtack spot, shits serious. I’m actually scared for the guy.
Darby to climb mount everest Darby once said he doesn't mind dying
Jay White is a STAR.
Darby you don’t need Sting you did it before you can do it again. I was homeless before also. Darby you can do it
Wrestling is not Fake! And neither is the NFL....😉......😯
If he actually climbs Mount Everest I’ll be concerned
Everyone pray for darby safety as he takes on MT EVEREST.
He’s mega rich he’ll have the best equipment etc so he ain’t gonna die🤦‍♂️
He should return from Mt Everest in the Crow persona. 👀
You can do this Darby!!! Fingers crossed!
DARBY ALLEN VS. MOUNT EVEREST DARBY WINS💪
4 people a year don't make it back from Everest. Good luck Darby, bro. That climb is an incredibly bad decision.
This is how Jay White should always be used.
Mount Everest Welcome to our home man Love form Nepal darby❤❤
jay on the mic is gold 😂  Darby was quick with it though has come along way 👍
Mt. Everest is no joke Darby: hold my bat
Honestly this promo is so eerie. I'm so scared for darby
Need a harbored championship for aew. You have some of the best talent for those matches in the company. Darby, Jeff, Matt, penta, phenix, rvd, hangman, archer and sure I missed a few.
So  Darby is tag champs with himself?
Darby will be new sting
I miss Sting already 😢
Is Darby allin from Atlanta Georgia or something
May Allah almighty bless Darby Allen  May Allah almighty continue to give him wisdom patience and virtue to overcome obstacles and challenges that he may face or encounter  he is a great wrestler and very talented
We miss you STING
This company is mad. Why would they allow a guy to do something so dangerous. Could you imagine Austin taking off to climb a mountain 😂
I pray that darby return safely
I think Derby is Psycho in real life
I'm surprised Darby hasn't used actual dynamite
Jay White is the most overrated wrestler alive.
Tbh I like aew it's just not the same with sting on their :(
I'm rooting for everest!
Please come back Darby from everest
Man looking at Darby without Sting is really sad. Let's what he can do now that he's by himself.
OMG AEW SUCKS 😂
They better give this man a World Championship run in the near future. He put his body on the line last weekend so Sting could go out on his own terms. Now, he's not only gonna fight Jay White next week, but after that, he's gonna climb Mount Everest. He better come back in one piece & when he does, they better start preparing him for a World Heavyweight Championship run. If there's anybody that deserves it on that roster, it's Darby Allin.
what matters is does darby see christ in sting.
if you are really coming to climb mount everest.. then Welcome to Nepal🇳🇵Darby
“Bang,Bang Scissor Gang” That Definitely Really Sus Like Why Whould even Call yourselves that 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
maybe cody rhodes
Darby has a interesting path ahead, he has everything to become world champion after swerve
Is Jay a face or heel ?
I'm thinking this whole Everest thing is code for something else but not quite sure. Maybe going after Christian Cage?
Lord Jesus Christ is the Only Way to Heaven. Repent & Accept Him as Your Personal Saviour. He will Accept You as His Child. See You in Heaven. God Bless...❤
Come back to us Darby
Time for Darby to man up on his own. But if he wants to throw his body away and end his career short, that's on him.
Great promo 👌
Darby is carrying Stings bat now, does that mean he’s the new Sting? His successor?
Darby just got eviscerated by Cornette
Joins The House Of Black
Im becoming a huge darby fan. Hes got the two most iconic looks of sting molded together. He is a very skilled wrestler and has that Pop about him. He is going to be great in the buisness and sting couldnt have passed the torch to a better and most himble canidate! Also dude went from super skinny to pretty jacked in the last 5 years showinf his dedication to the craft without being a roider
I like Darby but holy shit he gonna end dead one day doing these spots.
Jay White's rly cooking in his recent promos.  That's the Catalyst/King Switch AEW needs!
I wanted Everest in 2008 after my last tour in Iraq  Had money saved , was going to get my gear  But they couldn’t give me medical clearance to train and climb  I tried 4 times , all turn downs  I suffered a bad cold weather injury when I was training in Germany ..  Climbing that mountain is real world stuff , not like wrestling  You die up there , you stay there
😢 I am so worried about him. I love Darby, he’s amazing so much so I even named my newest furbaby after him. 🙏🏼🙏🏼
Damn, it’s crazy where the 4 pillars are now!  One is suspended One is injured One has basically quit the company  AND NOW ONE IS GOING ON A DEADLY MOUNTAIN CLIMB!!! 💀
I miss Jay White's Switchblade dark character. This just feels abit funny and off.
I Love Darby and he gotta keep that intensity going i hope he keep that Stings Bat
Hey darby. I will seriously buy that bat off of you. The durability is amazing. Love the material he uses. But yeah, he has big shoes to fill now. I dont think darby is staying much longer.
✨ATLANTA✨
I really don't think it's wise to have one of your wrestlers or under contract climb Mount Everest with the potential of him losing his life But that's just me.
Jay's promo just...flat. Oof. That was poor.
Juice Robinson sounds like Korg
That tag title is gorgeous
Darby seems exited, crying ,or high. Cus usually he has a deep voice
He should win the aew world championship since he has no other tag team partner
How are you supposed to take an emotional promo seriously when the man has face paint on lol
I thought Darby was homeless in Seattle? And I hope he follows the Sting persona.
🤡
Close your eyes while listening to this! Once they are closed now picture Jesse Pinkman talking lol
Darby Ailin is a bad ass wrestler and i like it
The mount Everest thing is a bit over the top and a little attention seeking unnecessary moment, but we all know Mt Everest is no joke.
Please be safe Darby don't die man. 🙏
Pray for darby. He is young and reckless.
Yo Darby  u are the coolest  wrestler  in aew
Why he dressed like 2000s jeff hardy
Hr could at least paint the rest of his face now n bulk up
😴😴😴😴
Strange promo, someone’s gotta look out for this kid
Darby is a real one 🐐
no Excalibur you said it right the first time  2:45 it's Bullet Club Gold music, not the scissor gang music get Bullet Club Gold away from the acclaimed now to the promo Jay missed the opportunity to announce that The Gunns will be in the AEW tag team tournament especially when Darby said 2:16 so the next team that wins this congratulation Guns Up👆👆 for The Gunns to win
What about Hulk Hogan's last match? And Hulk Hogan's retirement celebration? Hulk Hogan has yet to have his last match, Hogan's yet to retire, and Hogan has never had an in ring celebration like this before. What about it? What about HOGAN
Jake Whites new Zealand accent mixed starting to sound very south African 😂😂😂
Darby looks like a lost little boy 😢
I liked Darby taking a jab at Jay's run so far at AEW. It has been underwhelming, and hopefully by taking such a jab they are hinting that Jay will be getting some sort of a much needed push.
Darby the glorified backyarder. Please retire.
When Darby talks you can tell that he's a little slower than when he first started wrestling
He reminds me of jesse pinkman
Oh no what will spooky jesse pinkman do now
I pray he doesn't come back
Good luck on mt.evrast
Darby rules
whatever you do darby get everything that you could get for mount everest get a jetpack or a parasuit if you had to because even for the best mountain climbers that mountain could be the most dangerous mountain for literaly everyone
It's a lot of poop on mount Everest and they make you carry ya poop around because it's becoming so much. Darby wants to see dead bodies and poop 😂😂😂
Bro, Darby Allin needs a vacation, heal up. Man, I tell you what, everyone is behind Darby, when he wins the AEW world championship, I feel the roof would blow off. Dude deserves it. But so do many others in AEW! damn! AEW is the damn best in the world! No matter what, lets all enjoy the best wrestling show every Wednesday, Friday and Saturday!
I like this kid, but he seriously needs to slow down. that glass spot was needless and could've ended so much worse. and now he's off to climb Mount Everest. like I admire the balls of the guy to pull off stuff like that but tbh wrestling is about longevity and right now Darby seems like he's doing everything in his power to keep his career as short as possible. i'd hate to see him retire early so I hope he slows down a bit to deliver some more great matches in the future
Darby is the shits
AEW IS THE BEST 👍🏼
darby make sure you comply with health and safety climbing Everest wear safety shoes, ear plugs and glasses
The f*cked up thing about climbing Everest is that going up is only half of the work, coming down is just as dangerous.There is a reason why a lot of climbers disappear and die during the descent from the summit. I hope Darby doesn't take any unnecessary risks, because that mountain is unforgiving.
He published that they have to give more value to one of the greats JAY  WHITE 👆
Good luck on Everest, Darby!
Darby welcome to the land of Mount Everest ♥️♥️♥️
What is this mount everest
Lets all pray that darby comes back from mount everest. Its no joke trying to climb that.  Also, i thought bullet club gold became faces with the acclaimed and daddy ass
😢❤
Darby i can say one of the OG AEW guy that come since the first  So i hope AEW not ruined his carrer
Don't give up your belts Darby partner up with Daniel gurcerier would make a fantastic tag team he would always have your back as you him and he's a brilliant wresler as you are please stay and partner up with Daniel am shore you won't regret it please consider it say you will ❤❤
👑 🗡  👆
Darby should join Bullet Club Gold. Have a Heel run please.......
What if Darby came back from Everest as sting??
Don't disrespect the cardblade😂
It kinda pains me seeing Jay White cut these quick cheap promos without anything to properly work with.
Adam (Edge) join Darby
Jay White seemed strangely hesitant and a bit unsure of himself in this promo. Still, Darby's bits were really good.
Darby has given Sting what Sting wanted to give back to the community. Applause to both of you men
This guy is such a dork.
In my opinion Darby has earned the right to at least start climbing the World title ladder.
Good luck on climbing MT Everest Darby, will pray you conquer it and come back from it in one piece please 🙏🏻🤞🏻
Darby is super Star
This segment was way too long. Jay White is Great in the ring, but lousy on the mic. Keep His promos Short.👍🏾
Darby you son of a gun don't make us nervous like that. Stay safe Darby! Will be waiting for you and good luck at mount Everest!
Geil Big Business Darby Allin vs Jay White ❤
I hope Sting's Sons will become a tag team & dress in His 80s/early 90s Style.👍🏾
maybe streamer on twitch as "gothic make up princess"
May Darby Allin have a long and healthy lifestyle. Thank you Sting and thank you Darby Allin..💥🔥🦂🐺🤘🏾 And Jay White needs that AEW or at least TNT title...💥💥💥💥💥💥
Darby is the fucking goat
Now all Stingers support Darby! What an awesome guy! Hope he comes back from Everest in one piece!
Fkin boring
Darby will never die comeback with success all the best darby 🙏we pray for you be careful gi and finish your dream fulfilled
7:06 Darby said something about being real fucking bored with something
Without Sting is like something else bro like the faze Jarvis meme "it's so haaaard"😢
Please be okay Darby your the greatest
Cool 😎
Is that Jesse pinkman? Lol
It never would have been an issue before. The emergence of Taiku Watti has ruined Jay White for me lol. It's so hard to take him seriously when I keep waiting for him to say swear wolves
Be careful Darby we love you good luck sting will miss you
Andrade, Miro, now switchblade, every wrestler in a slump is given a fantastic match by Darby. He makes everyone look amazing
We need more darby allin. Stay safe buddy
If Darby comes back from Everest, it's time. It's time to put the belt on the kid.
Anyone remember Bradshaw claiming he would climb Everest, that all went very quiet lol.
Darby is the best
Applause to darby and sting
Darby? He can paint his cute fingernails now. LOL!!!! Maybe pink or red???? Diverse and woke rocks!!!
Jay needs a big win
All im saying is Don't be surprised if you see 1993-2024
I am genuinely worried about this Mount Everest adventure he plans on taking. I recently watched "The Society of Snow" film and remembered the gut wrenching unforgiving weather conditions this survivors of a went through. Different situation but blistering weather all the same. Truly praying he will be safe 🙏
Darby is future in wrestling ❤
Welcome to Nepal🇳🇵 Darby
It might not mean much but I'm freaking happy they brought back the entrance tunnels
Climb Mt.Everest? This kid wants to die. Professional climbers that have decades of experience and training are laying frozen for eternity and their bodies will never be recovered. This kid really has a death wish.
I’m confused I thought Jay white was a baby face now with the bang bang scissor gang ?
Darby is wasting his money on Everest
Bullet Club Gold is heel but The Acclaimed are face?
Come back safe for your fans Darby🥰💞💞
Darby is gonna breathe with the Switchblade...Which will be good, he'll need all the oxygen he can get to climb Everest. 👆✌️  (Sidenote: Enjoy the trip to Everest Mr Allin, well earned!)
What Darby whisper?
I hope Darby be ok 😢
god, darby really saying bye to the fans..god I hope he makes it back in one piece
Either control this guy or release him, he’s going to killing himself in the ring one day
There is a French Arab dude that climbed Everest without any prior training, so if you’re crazy enough everything is possible I guess.
It's time for someone to have Darby's back.
The stuff that Darby Allin has done in the last few weeks may take on a completely different meaning if he doesn’t make it back from Everest. Hope he makes it back safe!
Darby finna learn what it’s like to breathe with the switchblade 🤣
to me Darby is not one of my favorites but always having him "have to be with Sting" the last few years (I mean like all the time ... not every so often esp if Darby grew up as a Sting fan and he wanted to do this) ... was holding Darby back character wise ... I think now he can change and/or grow, moving forward
Darby was homeless he never sed 😅
why don't they go golf together
jay white kissed the bat he crazy😂
I am really proud Mt Everest Is in Nepal 🇳🇵!!! I am glad!! ❤❤❤
What did darby whisper to jays ear😇😭😭..
He might be the only wrestler “please don’t die” applies to any time he enters a wrestling ring
I’m praying Darby makes it back safe
Jay White really needs to stop cutting promos while moving unstably. Hard to take him seriously like that.
Sounds like a sell out (fart noise)
Can Taika Waititi get Jay White in a movie already?
Him climbing Mount Everest is my biggest concern, and is not to be taken lightly. we beg you to come back in one piece. We love you.
Big Bill & Brian Cage as next tag team champions 🙏
imagine he responded with... "I like turtles"
I think AEW should do a Darby Derby and find a replacement for Sting. Do a round robin style matchmaking and do the finale on a PPV.
Did I miss something? Did Switchblade and the Gunn Brothers go back to being heels at Revolution?
If Darby makes it to the top of Mt Everest he will probably just jump off of it into a bunch of fluorescent light tubes
Darby performing a coffin drop from the summit   In all seriousness I wish him the best of luck,  love you Darby🤘💀
He will tragically die being sacrificed for Sting knowing AEW and their dark energy…wouldn’t surprise me one BIT!
Jay White to Main Eventer to Mid Carder!
What kind of random thing is that to say in an interview? lol. Mount Everest? It’s cool, but to just come out with it in a promo… hmm.
Dudes legit got a death wish.
Darby Allin will be a watchable wrestler for years to come.
He's gonna turn heel
Jes gonna turn heel
Is that jesse from breaking bad?
Atlantis Jr needs to b he's partner
Jay White is fucking fantastic on the mic, holy shit. I’ve never seen him before, and I lived through The Great One on the mic. I also saw a lot of CM Punk. This dude is up there.
I’m confused is jay white heel or baby face ?
He should change his mind about climbing Mount everest..
He acting like he's gonna die
Climbing Everest will be a huge challenge for Darby, but I know you've climbed several dangerous peaks in your career and life in general, and you'll handle it😊😢❤
You better come back alive because we really need you 💗
Darby vs. Sting should've happened smh... pass the damn torch....why oh why
the fact that he's one of the least injured aew wrestler is insane
Darby is putting his life on the line at Everest . If he climbs he might have to stop and come Back expert hikers are still up there. Beware rainbow alley.
You are warmly welcome to my beautiful country, Nepal 🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵 love you darby🤗🤗🤗 and all the very best for climbing mount everest 😇😇😇
I dig the new dynamite logo
Sting really put Darby over as the future hopefully he accomplishes his goal with Everest
🎉Darby is a class act. I don't disagree with Jim Cornette very often... but I believe Darby has brought explosiveness and something exciting and unique to pro wrestling. He is a tough kid in world class shape... I hope he reaches his goal!
Why’s he always dressed like a teenage girl
Welcome to Nepal 🇳🇵 Once is not enough.
People have went up... and never came back... stay safe dude.
Somewhen down the line darbs will be aew world champ and sting will come out to congratulate him  I hope it’s soon  What a visual that would be
Wtf is this booking, why put the belt on sting and darby to do nothing   ...
Jay White is just amazing on the mic!
💀💀💀🔥
Damn...that kinda sounded like his "goodbye" to everyone..... 😮
What the f*ck is this? Dude is basically saying he knows he’s going to die climbing Everest? That’s a strange thing to say on TV. Especially if he’s legitimately going to climb it.
If he dies, he dies.
This man is not coming back
DARBY ALLIN reminds me of a YOUNG JEFF HARDY!!!
With only 1 week of build and 1 promo between the two this is how you setup a match. This is gonna be a banger, give the win to Switchblade Jay White and this can reposition him as the singles star that he really is. Darby be safe and we all pray for you to climb Mount Everest and return home to AEW.
I wonder what he whispered in jay white’s ear
Why would they cheer this man for saying he was homeless in downtown Atlanta lol
This was the best Dynamite I have seen in a while ❤❤❤
Darby will get to the peak of Everest and then Christian Cage does a run-in somehow
Dang this promo feels eerie. God please don’t let Darby die on Mount Everest
C'mon Darby, please don't die, we need you to be our champion 😭
Hope Jesse pinkman makes it back from Mount Everest
Give Jay White more TV time he's great
Darby should have painted other side of his face and sting wiping rest of paint off
Darby looks like homeboy from breaking bad
Jay White NJPW >>>> Jay White AEW
I've never liked Darby but TBH AEW Needs to go All In(Pun intended) and make him the biggest Babyface in the company, Give him a proper Title Run and make this guy as big as MJF.  This is your best homegrown Babyface and if Tony and AEW don't make him the biggest Babyface in the company they will waste the momentum he has going after Sting's Entire run with him.
The feeling is restored ❤
it  sounds  like  was  watchin  the  warrior again   after  his   promo   last  one
Darby needs to be DLC in the next skate game he already take 0 fall damage 😂
I thought jay white literally just turned face? Whys he a heel again?
What happens to the tag team belts?
He needs a tag partner.  ⚡⚡
What if he actually dies?
Darby Allin is this generation, Sting.  The torch 🔦 has been passed.
I mean Darby has a good point, Jay White haven’t done much sense. Jay should easily be in the AEW World Title picture.
Time to get a real job
Welcome to the land of everest Darby  Welcome to our country Nepal❤
Is it me or does Darby Allin remind you of Jesse Pinkman?
i want darby's shirt !!
I was really hoping that Darby would retire the face paint in honor of Sting and adopt a new look. It's a missed opportunity.
Does Darby have mental health issues? The was hes talking about Everest makes you think he legitimately wants to die.
Darby Allin.
I wouldn't gloat about climbing Everest. SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE CLIMBED IT NOW. should have the name changed to garbage mountain. It's not even beautiful up there now. It's just trash everywhere
So happy for you Darby for saying the name of mount Everest😊 proud to be a Nepalese🇳🇵
I’m not a fan of Darby’s but I truly admire the adoration he has for Sting.  This definitely has “goodbye” vibes to it. Hopefully the guy makes it back.
The first time darby has been on his own in so long. I wonder if aew will keep em has a kid card guy or make him a bigger deal now. btw darby dont die on that mountain💀bro is a wild human
Damn Darby perfectly getting the bat under his chin was smooth as hell
I figured sting would show up to hand in his title
Going on vacation for 2 months and see if he comes back alive from MOUNT ABEREST.
Hopefully a new shirt
Jay White shouldn't be in Charge of his own Creative....just No
Darby amazing he easy beat switch guy
All AEW matches are the same. No DQ, no rules, exchanging forearms, too many false-finishes, and anti-climaxes.  MJF and CM Punk made the best program so far in AEW.
"What is Darby Allen without Sting?" Darby should have gently pulled the microphone over to himself, asked Ol' switchblade how many TNT Championships he's won, then slid out of the ring and walked on back.
why? this match makes no sense?
It's strange that Sting was Darby's mentor and not Jeff Hardy.. Style-wise, look-wise, even gimmick-wise, Jeff would have made more sense as Darby's mentor than Sting.
Has anyone taken crazier bumps than Darby? Honest question. He’s borderline suicidal so it would be difficult to imagine.
After this promo they have to make Jay win, right?
the Sting traits have not only rubbed off, but it's now almost a torch passing for Darby. I love it and it's a really cool character touch to Darby's personality. we are only one show removed from Sting's retirement and Darby is so incredibly over as a result of it. dude didn't say a single word and they were chanting his name, the cheering for his Mount Everest announcement. dude has it. the day he finally wins that world title will be on the level of Jeff Hardy Armageddon 08 or Bryan's world title win at Mania 30.
Well he will still have his stupid face tattoo  without sting
Lmao how is he still walking after that spot
RIP Derpy
Esto parece una carta de despedida 😿
Why do I have a bad feeling about Darby going to Everest 😢
Bro why tf are you climbing Mount Everest??? What's the fkin' point?   Doesn't make sense. This sounds like a farewell.
New pillars: Darby, Swerve, jay, Christian cage
give darby jeff hardy
Good match darby! But stop making stings retirement match about you!
There is a very real chance that was Darby’s last ever promo. If not, when he comes back from Everest, I propose we christen him “The Immortal” Darby Allin.
Darby scissor hands it's actually spot on ngl 🤣
hopefully this leads to something for all of them.
The grim reaper must be lovin this for darby?
Darby still has a chance to back out Mt. Everest. Your life is way more important than some stupid mountain climbing. Please reconsider. You have a great career in AEW! Don’t piss it all away
🇳🇵🗻welcome
everyone in the crowd looks like they haven't showered in weeks
Jay White should have took the Belt from MJF,Even know i like Joe as Champion,but there decision really killer Jay Leathel legacy in the states,He is probably the most decorated champion in AEW..
On my pro wrestling podcast, I've praised Darby Allin time and time again. I'll never forget seeing him skateboard down the ramp and clothesline Chris Jericho. The dude's fantastic. So many moments in AEW. The dude's unique. No fear. No intimidation. Best of luck to him with climbing Mt. Everest. I should probably actually talk about it on my show.
I think an extra large pack of bandaids is next for Darby
To hear him so casually say he might not come back alive 👀
Taz 3 on 1 no the bat evens the odds for sure
Darby is going to be the last hope for AEW and he's going to be alright because Sting showed him the ropes on how to be a professional wrestler on and outside the ring
Darby
Climbing Everest? We welcome you Mr Darby. We treat guest like our own brothers and sisters..🇳🇵🇳🇵
My respects for darby allen just reached new heights ❤ love this man
Darby having Stings Bat with him at all times from now on is the good shit.
If darby sadly dies hell go down as one of the best at this young of a age
I don't love every Darby Allin match - I feel like he often gets himself hurt for low stakes, but I love Darby the person - just this fearless ball of human conviction.
Please tell me Darby climbing Everest is a shoot. Lol
Kissing the tip is wiiiild crazy, Jay.
So wait... are BCG still supposed to be heels and The Acclaimed still supposed to be faces?
I’m seriously going to be praying for Darby the day he climbs Mt Everest  🫶🏾
New pillars: Jay, Adam Cole, Swerve, Wardlow
5:02 Before Stings AEW debute didn’t Darby Allin defeat Cody Rhodes for The TNT 🧨 Championship at AEW Full Gear ⚙️ 2020 ?
Thai man is insane.
Please make it back safe Darby
He’s right jay white hasn’t done anything since he left new Japan and that’s just sad
Can Darby still defend rhd tag titles
Yeahhhhhhhh
Yes
Whenever i see this guy jay white i always remember how damian priest destroyed him in Roh reminds of how undertaker planted Shawn Michaels
Darby please replace the legend icon sting from orange Cassidy
Why do the bang band crew remind me of 3 count?
Darby coming to our country to climb everest? Would be nice to meet him once but that's just a dream I guess.
darby is a great and determined worker, he will climb that mount and come back victorious , he is indestructible
jim cornette gonna have field day with this one
Darby been my favorite Aew wrestler since I watched episode one. This promo got me. Hope you make it back okay Darby.
I'm going to miss Sting💯💔😥🦂 Be safe on that climb Darby.
Welcome back to mt everst...Nepal❤we love u darby..🎉
....I thought white was a baby face literally a few day's ago 😂😂
Nepal 🇳🇵🇳🇵💝🙏 🤗
Nepal 🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵💝🙏
Decent build up... Hope the match delivers
I was homeless right here in downtown Atlanta..... fans start cheering! 😂 wtf
Imagine signing okada nd osprey nd Mercedes nd still being #2😂
Welcome to my country, Mt Everest is our roof. Welcome to Nepal, darby Allin. This will be life time experience that will always live with in ur soul
Darby won the Tag Titles  against Big Bill and Ricky Starts "The Playa from the Himalaya" and now he is climbing the Everest, how ironic
I honestly think Sting's last match should've been against Darby.
I like how everyone is ignoring how horrible Jay Whites promo was😂. Typical AEW comment section
Danhausen should team up with him.
Heaven is myth Nepal 🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵is real Wlc Darby
Heaven is myth Nepal 🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵is real Wlc Darby
Darby can't cut a promo without almost crying. Aew is horrible yuck
Darby with stings bat fighting chefs kiss honestly I was hoping he would get it after the match but this is better now he’s alone like sting was back then against the nwo and now he gets to use the bat to help him
Come to India we are waiting ❤❤
Love the new stage set and colour schemes of dynamite, and best wishes to Darby climbing Everest!
This kid seems depressed
We will be waiting 🇳🇵
Darby Allen vs Dustin Rhodes needs to happen please 🙏
Makes the most sense
If Darby could die for Sting, he definitely can conquer Mount Everest.
Time for Darby to evolve from Robin into Nightwing. Good luck on your climb, dude.
Darby is coming to Nepal to climb mount everest 🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵
Darby is the next Icon
Just fake his death and return to AEW with ice/blizzard theme entrance
Hope to see u in Nepal god Shiva will protect u will reach top of everest n back safe to ur home aew
And now im worried for Darby Allin.
❤ I love Darby......he attacks everything like it's his last day.  Thts all you can do
Look at darbys manurism
Uh, I get that Jay White is a big deal in Japan where he doesn't have to talk, but what's the big deal about him here?
DARBY ITS SHOWTIME!!!
Darby and Switchblade will meet at Big Business!
Darby had gotten better at promos
Pray to god Darby doesn’t die on Everest
I seriously worry about Darby doing climbing Mount Everest. He needs to train with professionals. Even then there is no guarantee.
Omg darby nepal 🇳🇵 for attend mt.Everest climbing mountains 🏔️ it’s tough thooo❤❤
I would like to see Darby carry on Stings Bat for the rest or majority of his career no matter where he goes to
Welcome to nepal Dardy allin  ❤❤
Good Luck on the climb, Darby  This promo felt so grim, I think it just now hit him how dangerous this whole thing is gonna be  I hope he makes it back in one piece  Also, I love that Darby has inherited Sting's bat, I really hope he keeps that with him as a regular aspect of his character
His whole career was dependent on Sting - now that sting has left, he will sadly become irrelevant
God please be with Darby..
What's Big business is  having Darby regret his alignment with sting , and create an. Angle where he double crosses sting , and say F you sting 🤣🤣🤣🤣, than have a blow off @wembley
AEW is on fire again, holy shit
Saw Darby wrestle about 5 yrs ago while he was homeless & I knew he was going to be someone special ❤
Jay white is gonna retire Darby next week...
Darby Allin will climb one mountain (Mount Everest), and then return to AEW to climb another mountain (AEW World Championship).
Good luck to Darby climbing to Mt. Everest. Got to have a lot of endurance for that
Darby got to step up his game even though sting is now officially retired from wrestling Darby is on his own now next week Darby and Jay white one on one
TF is he wearing?!?
Please come back after everest darby , im watch aew because you and sting . Be careful for mount everest
Darby Allin Absolutely Never Disappoints
Man, darby has grown so much. From barely being able to cut a promo, to having his best promo segments back to back. My man is ready for that champ.
Darby blows
Regardless of what he does, he needs to do it quick. His career is going to be short…Mark Briscoe should have been a choice for a tag partner. Jay White should be the top heel in the company.
Darby Darby Darby !!!
What I really want to know is what did he whisper to him
Safe trip Darby 🙏
Darby Allin is the Sting's Passing of the Torch. He is the new Crow, the new avenger. And if he continues this path: a future icon himself.
I f**king hate this gorefest stuntman. But I get some people like it. Each to their own. Moving on.
Welcome to the Himalayas Darby
Jay is such a good promo. His style is unique to him. I love it.
I love darby ,good boy❤❤❤❤❤
Did Darby put on weight or something?  He looks bigger than I remember.
He'll be first pro wrestler to climb Everest if he succeeds
7:04 what did he tell him?
The wrestling world would burn if Darby dies on Mt. Everest and the scary part is that may happen
Darby Allen :- only active and alive piller of AEW
Can’t wait for next week’s match 🔥
Well said by Darby Allen said are done Jay White!!Jay said yep done.🤣🤣🤣🎤🎤
Welcome to Nepal  Darby  and good luck  for highest peak my Everest  we will be waiting
Jay White is not gonna make it happen with the American audience, just stop, he's not good enough
Best of luck to Darby Allin on his journey to reach the top of the World.
Best of luck to Darby on his trip to Everest.
Sting really made me like this guy
I'm sure Mount Everest will be a relaxing trip for Darby Allin.
BANG BANG SCISSOR GANG !!!!!!!
Darby Allen is one best...I like the guy...Jay White comes out with buddys and feel like he heel again. Darby Allen have safe trip that mountain and come back one bro!!This great interview watch and he put title down in ring.💛🤍🖤🎤🎤
What’s next for Darby, absolutely nothing cause he sucks, he was only relevant cause of the icon Sting, Sting will be missed Thanks to the legend the icon Sting
I'm sure Darby Allin will go for the TNT Championship again or be a future AEW International Champion.
DARBI is a future Icon.
There are 3 certain things in this world:  Death Taxes and Darby Allin climbing a Mountain 🏔️ 😮....
Looks like Sting passed his Crow powers to Darby because he looks more buff and spooky than before. Even added glass shards into his face paint.
Darby Allin is INSANE for climbing Mount Everest because some people don’t survive. Darby vs Jay next week should be an excellent match really looking forward to seeing that
Darby has given Sting what Sting wanted to give back to the community. Applause to both of you men
Fingers crossed Darby comes back from Everest in one piece.
Vince McMahon if he accepted Darby, Allin wouldn’t have to do this. Man Vince really screwed the industry. Give this man the world title.
The Catalyst!!!
Please don't die, Darby! We need you in one piece! Come back alive and be careful! Mount Everest is no laughing matter! 😟
Not even Mount Everest can scare Darby Allin 😮!!!

Good Luck Darby climbing Everest 💀👍 AEW 😎 F the haters
This is the moment Darby needs to step out and truly forge his own identity. Can't wait.
