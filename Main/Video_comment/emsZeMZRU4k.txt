Who’s here after Adama Traore joined Fulham?
This video is awesome :)
I love wolves
Areola is a joke
i'm italian but this commentary made me excited, well played lads!
Тут есть русские?
I think Adama is a great player he improved a lot. His only problem he seems to do things the hard way to get a result instead of taking the easy option. Like you don't always need to run down the line to make a cross you can do an early cross or work some passes into a better position for a cross. He can even cross when a defender is in front of him instead of beating him first on the dribble. Look at Spain without him they still manage to get crosses in but through passing.   The reason he scored this time is this is a rare occasion he receives the ball from a pass and then is expected to kick for goal. Adama spends too much time trying to dribbling first far from goal than trying to score. That's why he rarely scores anymore. If he wants goals for himself he needs to receive a through ball from a pass using his speed.

🇵🇹 Wolves!
I was a very poor person, who was not always lucky when it came to playing the lottery.  I have played the lottery since I was 19 years old and now I am 45 !!!  ... which means that I have been playing the lottery for a long time.  The highest amount I have ever won was $ 400 ... funny, right?  But one day my story goes down in history after I discovered this man's name on the internet ... I heard that he is the best when it comes to winning the lottery ... well I never believed it, I just decided to give it a try.  My luck  !  for the last time!  so boom !!!  My life changed in seconds.  This man is a very strong voodoo who provides numbers that will never fail.  After all my years working and fighting to win the lottery, I finally won ($ 30,000,000) and it wasn't just what I won, there are so many more!  Dr. okiki the great!  is the name of this great person, send a message  or contact by WhatsApp now +2348071452791 ... percent remember that I am not writing thist just for fun.  I have suffered and struggled all my life.  But now I'm okay!  So I know that many other people have been through the same thing and are still going through it !!  Only then is it possible to win the lottery and not miss this opportunity!  It's life changing!  you can also be happy in these parties with your family and friends !!  don't you dare miss this opportunity !!  I'm saying that some will think it's not real !!  your lost!
Offside 1 bulu tangan aja di anulir, *LIAT DONK WASIT LIDA KAMI.* 🙈🙈
And here we are now, Adama Traore scores his annual goal. World class!
I loooovvveeeee Wolves Tv!!!!! 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️👐🏼👐🏼😆😅
Extended highlights?
Jesus Christ loves you, so much that He died for you on the cross, to pay the penalty of your sins so that you wouldn't have to. Put your full trust and believe in Him for salvation today, because who the Son sets free is free indeed 🙏🏻 Kindly consider receiving Him into your heart as your LORD and Saviour, it's the best decision you'll ever make 😊 (Romans 10:9-10 and Ephesians 2:8-9)
What happen with Raúl Jiménez
It should have been 2-0 the first goal count.
Adama after shooting for the 1000th time this season finally gets a goal.
Fantastic finish🔥
monster adama again...👍👍
ADAMA strooooooooooong 😂😂😂
Good to see Adama scoring again,such a great player 100%!
Am happy to have Adama traore on my Fantasy premier league ❤🙌💪
That's not offside. #VAROUT
fulham vs portugal
Amazing football from Wolves
Adama!!!! For me u are Best player in the world
Robinson is a good leftback
Now that was a goal.........Willian Jose robbed
VAR really really 💩💩💩
Adama is a 🐂🐂 Bull
Should VAR OFFICIAL learn from playstation for offside regulation?🤔🤔
Take a look at the eyes 👀 of traore glancing for the teammate bear hug, and he avoided it, making the teammate catching air😂😂😂2:02
Adama 'BabyOil' Treore
The commentary on Adama's goal🔥♥️...a blast that was.
VAR is the worst thing since sadam Hussain
Adama is back! Let's hope the Mexican wolf is ready soon.
Nice shoot
Adama got them thighs even if the keeper got to the ball, he would of ended up in the net 😂
Are u kidding me? how is that goal disallowed??
Adama Traore should be worth 15-25 mi
Totw?
If Traore could finish better he would be the best winger/attacker in PL
VAR is ridiculous, ruining the beautiful football
Poor willian Jose robbed of his first premier league goal
fixed result and even what time to count the goal.
A unexpected beautiful goal.
Wolves is secretly Portugal National Team. Just look at their kit. lol
Renat Dadashov. Azerbaijan 🥰
Was a good goal but i think alphonse areola should of saved it.
2:10 they're always so violent when celebrating with Adama 😂
Adama ! Daaamn !  Oh and... what the actual ****, VAR ?!
Really ADAMA turned to BLACK ADAM from justice league
He's a heck of a sportsman.. impressive to watch! Shine even brighter BEAST
What a goal!
SERIOUSLY VAR
🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸
VAR is killing football 🙄🙄🙄
These wolves commentators should be given a raise their work is exemplary 🔥🔥🔥
Let's go hunting again🐺
Everyone soon changed their tune about Adama! The guy is a beast and a world beater on his day. Been saying for ages he is something special and we must keep him at all costs. Yet again man of the match for us becoming a regular thing now.  I also had a bet on him to get the first goal... 😄
Adama needs to be trained to place balls,or curve them his legs have enough power,like Thierry henry,and he would be world class striker.is their a trainer in wolves,who can put him into ball placing practice for hours facing a goalkeeper!?
Craben Cottach
God help fulham. Its a good team with good manager🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Adama's the new Hulk. Great win fam !
Fabio silva✨
That's the FUT Birthday Card version of Adama 👍🏻
Great goal and great commentry
Offside reaaaaalllllyyyyyy????? Ridiculous
Adama adama
Come on Wolves! We were able to win a very important game against Fulham. In a divided and very boring match, it was epic to win it at the end of the match, which gives us a little peace of mind at the table. The VAR is a shame, check the regulations also because you cannot charge an offside per arm.
ANOTHER ARMPIT OFFSIDE
VR just F*****G things up in each n every game. Why the F**K this thing still exist??
I seen us scoring more I'm happy with one goal win tho up front we are getting better keep that energy nice football let's go big yourself up team balance sharp shooters🎶🕺🏾🎶🌟😁
Var is a big scam in football. How could var disallow wolves clean goal
Wolves needed the good judgement of the referee to get that sOle goal
Beautiful goal. Keep working in the final ball. You got this Adama. World Number 1 if you can focus.
You try to take a balanced view..but that VAR decision is just..(sigh)..
That's the way to do it .always wolves 🐺⚽️👍
What i shot i felt that shot would have broken the wrist of the goalie if he got a hand to it
It's not VAR that's the problem. It's the planks that monitor it ! That was clearly a goal .Two arms equally along the line. It's good Traoré won the game fair and square in the end. What an absolute unit !!
Adama is a beast!
Even though it got given as offside even though everyone knows that was never offside I think it will still give willian Jose a lot of confidence because he knows he can score it’s just about doing it in games
Is this Portugal National team?
lucky
Stupid offside decision
Wolves away kit is really a dead give away. Its basically the portugal's home kit already
Beast goal
Why did they not allow that goal? Did they count the arm too?
We need this season over, hit the reset button with 2 centre halves, a creative attacking midfielder and a no9 recruited. Its not been right all season.
Honestly I feel bad for Fulham, losing in the last min is terrible but I’m happy that we won and Adama finally got a goal
What a goal
Fábio didn't got a call from U21 Portugal coach to play in Euro, imagine the amount of talent they have. He is U19 right now at national level alongside other future Portuguese stars as the 2 wingers, Umaro Embalo and Felix Correia etc.
Finally wolves wearing Portugal kit
Change the offside rule or get rid of VAR. Shocking decision.
Wow, that VAR call! How on Earth did they make a decision on that one.......?
Good win but I hope Neto is fine.
Adama if in fifa oh no
Great win!! Very tense but great goal, keeper could’ve done better at his near post but traore just blasted it!
Cruel from Adama. Consigning Fulham to relegation
Adama selección🤩
We have to keep adama players like that win you games the one player to get on that pass is adama💪and in the back of the net. Yes he needs to do it more often got to keep him.
How does somebody score from that angle?  Simply astonishing.
If Adama could finish like this just once every few matches, combined with his other abilities hed be a top pl player.
VAR .???
Adama siendo Adama 😍
ยิ่งสุดยอดมากคับสวยๆ
You could just imagine the scenes at moleneux when that rocket went in 🙇💥
Its No offside bro. Why I tell still hate VAR. It will make EPL decreased
Muy bien Semedo
That Jersey reminds me to Portugal
This jersey looks damn good
That strike from Adama 🔥
Si por ese gooooll gane
A thrilling game
That strike was just awesome last minute. Deserved to win the game. 1 goal ruled out but. Good Play by wolves. As a Liverpool fan.
Adama is a beast. What a goal!
Var needs to improve asap. This was an atrocious decision. That was proper cross, good header overall a fantastic goal ruled out by stupidity. (Arsenal fan)
He took it personally whe people said he only got pace and no end product 😂
Is william jose goal was offside?
dabba trailer
about time the big guy scored again! he's so fast and powerful you guys really need to hone in on that skill 💪💪
I miss Raul back in the yellow and black wolves
that goal made me $50 :)
Silva needs to be starting every game when we've invested 36 million on him lol goal and an assist in his last 2 games, both off the bench. If you add up all his minutes, he's only played about 10 games, 3 goals and 1 assist, very good for an 18 year old. Silva could be a big player for us next season!!
damm, fulham thought they're facing Portugal lol
No joke,if Adama will move to a top 5 team he will be more sensational 😊
Adama 😜❤️
I like the celebrations
Imagine if you guys wouldn’t have won the game after that MINDBLOWING var decision. Srsly while I was watching the game there wasn’t a doubt in my mind that’s Jose‘s goal wouldn’t be given. Var needs to be fixed for the good of the game
What about Fulham no 30 player hand in offside decision?🤔
Adamaaaaa 💥💥💥💥
0:58 What an amazing usage of technique. They would've call handball if ball hit Podence's arm on that line. And they give offside for that. In terms of VAR, EPL is the worst.
He tried to score a goal.like this against Chelsea, today ot went nice
Fulham.vs Portugal Selection team
Super saiyan Adama
My adama jersey has been in the mail for a couple weeks now can’t wait to get it 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Чётко по времени красавцы
Finally,Adama !
Adama this season: Goals - 1 Assists - 1
Fulham vs Portugal
thanks bro
Thank you Wolves.
VAR call was complete bullcrap. Glad we still got the victory. What a banger from Adama!
wow finally adama scored
What a goal fr Adama the man they call him a beast  💪
Волки красавцы!!
what a goal!!!
Go wolves
ADAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!
Brazilian Love wolver
Fulham blow their chances once again. With Newcastle inconsistent throughout yet unable to take opportunities. Along with West Brom & Sheff utd they will  surely face relegation.
А
Thank you - from a NUFC fan.
Amazing goal
he needed this for his confidence. lets keep it going adama!!!
Good job adama
HE DIDN'T NEED ANYBODY!!!!!
Esse uniforme é em homenagem a Portugal?
WOLVES ARE THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yo se que llegarán lejos,
fatality in last time...
Nice one Adama👌❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yes,is me and my idol Adama again!!!!
Merci Adama de me délivrer à la 93eme minute et de permettre de faire gagner 1000€ j’ai toujours aimé les Wolves , le karma me l’a rendu, merci
The limbs in my house 😂
Good to see Adama scoring again,such a great player
Adama a la Eurocopa 🇪🇦💪
Bien adan solo te falta jimenez buen camino
fabio is finally sparking, he's had a good 2 games. keep it up kiddo
Qué pedazo de gol de Adama, le metió una potencia impresionante a la pelota, de otra manera no entraba. No siempre hace golpes, pero los que hace son todos GOLAZOS.
The highlights made the game look better than it was, but that was a fantastic strike by Adama. You have to feel sorry for Jose being robbed of a goal, though.
Cómo le hace falta Raúl Jiménez..
Stockly park don't know what they're doing anymore
Thank u Adama❤️
Wow
It seems that they do not have forwards and if there are, none scores, they are very bad

Yes Great. Well deserved 👍♥️
FWAW🟠⚫️
kinda hard to believe semedo played for barca. the guy just gets bodied and loses possession easily to much
How did the heist not save that but lovely slot but he shouldn't have been beaten at that spot and angle
👍👍👍👍👍
