So glad I moved out of Georgia last year.... 22.5 out of my 23 years were in GA, and I do NOT regret leaving after seeing this.
Yeah you can tell by the comment section on any vaccine video how badly We the People want Your vaccine.
Fantastic news. God bless the great state of Georgia!!
Hold the line Dawgs
Ok Georgia might be among the lowest with those vaccinated, but look at the numbers, they have had 2.38 million cases and had 33K death since the pandemic started that are "COVID related". That means that there is a 1.38% chance of death if you currently live in Georgia. There are other things with a higher percentage of causing death than this virus. Stop pushing this fear-mongering narrative, and let the people decide on their own.
Georgians are smart, period.😆💯🎯👏🏾
Swine flu vax 1976
So glad to be from GA!! I know alot of others other than my family that have not had the vaccine. Our family had the vid a few weeks ago but it was not bad at all.
For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 6:23
But more importantly, we must support Fauci's Pfizer stock bottom line. Or JoeJoe will see to it that  you will be unemployed and denied life-saving medical care
Great! Let’s go Georgians
They had clearly developed Nanobots before this old Outer Limits Sci fi episode.  https://youtu.be/S0r6w3pNpGc
When they come up with a vaccine that gives you eternal life then I'll consider it. Otherwise, what's the point ? You're going to die regardless.
That's right.probably bc we're not stupid enuff to TRUST government.stick it in urass~
NYC has fewer people then Georgia, one of the highest vaccination rates in the country yet more “deaths” 🤔 sooooo why are y’all reporting on Georgia having a low vaccination rate? Are y’all trying to say vaccines don’t matter? Oh right of course not
Makes me want to move to Georgia.
Are the current death rates in GA highest among Margie Trailer Queen supporters?
2 Corinthians 7:1  1 Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.   James 4:7-8  7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.  8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.   1 Peter 5:8-9  8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:  9 Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.   James 1:12-16  12 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.  13 Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:  14 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.  15 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.  16 Do not err, my beloved brethren.   Galatians 5:16-25  16 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.  17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.  18 But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.  19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,  20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,  21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.  22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,  23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.  24 And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.  25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.   Ephesians 4:22-24  22 That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;  23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;  24 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.   1 Peter 2:11-12  11 Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;  12 Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
You really have to be foolish to get any of these "vaccines".
‼️‼️KEEP AWAY YOUR ARMS FROM THIS POISON ☠️ 💉☠️👈🏻SMART PEOPLE 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

Probably because of the black population. We have more reason not to trust America or it’s government
Smart patriots in Georgia!! Power to the People! Let’s Go Brandon!
Grand Jury Court Of Public Opinion on YouTube. Get information and tell the world...
CDC in Georgia tho 🧐🤔mmmmm mmmmm k
So
isn’t that a blue state, but the media keep saying it was right wing, white supremacists that where the ones not getting the jab. oh yeah you assholes lie for a living.
Guess what they just discovered? A new highly virulent variant of HIV-1, and according to Oxford University scientists, it appears to cause more rapid disease progression than other versions of the virus. People infected with this variant, named VB (virulent subtype B), have an average viral load that is between 3.5 and 5.5 times higher than usual for an HIV infection. what's next? God gave us the rainbow because he said he would never send another flood to purge the earth. Welcome to the new flood Covid and HIV.
Now if only Georgia can stop Stacey Abrams ballot harvesting scheme.
Respect to Georgians
Us Georgians also have the lowest infection rates across the US for such a popular state. We are a safe haven for Yankees and Californians because your own policies collapsed everything right about society. That’s why Biden rebukes Georgia so hard, he hates what he cannot control or manipulate just like Fauci.
Pure bloods, my kind of people.
I applaud you Georgians.  At least I know when the zombie outbreak starts,  that GEORGIA will be safe for a while.
Coronas gonna kill us all!
Seems I remember a group of men who could easily explain this…if only I remembered were they went off to
Babies needs booster chairs for adults🤣
Black folks ain't down with 'Tuskegee expirement part II'
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!
And yet georgia ranks, per capita, lower than  a lot states with higher vaccination rates
Yayy Georgia!
Good for Georgia!
Because we've been played and they dont stop the spread. Most of the people now have natural immunity thanks to Omicron.
They are waking up
Media is the enemy
Israel has 90% of their slaves, I mean residents, jabbed with their 4th jab, and they have the highest covid spikes, and still enslaved with mandates.  Obviously Georgia is on the right track!
Georgia has bigger problems!  Stacy Abraham's!  Liar just like the fake Media puppets 🇺🇸🇬🇧
The next gen Omicron shot through my whole family so fast I didn't have chance for a booster, nor do I need one at this point; and that's probably what most Georgians are thinking right now.
No mask . . no vaccine . . no problem . . ever.
Damn who knew they were based!?!
Go Georgia🙏🏽 CDC  petri dish No weapons Formed against us shall prosper ✍🏾
Well now we are all finding out that they are pure genius in Georgia! I am not living in Georgia and I am not from Georgia but I must give appreciation to Georgia that is good keep on doing what you are doing and remain god with a little g remain pure in blood pure in blood to your father who is God the first man. Way to go Georgia you have the lowest numbers of these people that have taken the blood of the beast and have been fooled to a no return road. So now I say to you with the booster shots. They are now talking about a fourth shot and also a annual shot. I say unto you where the heck does it end will you have to have babies born with horns.? Satan is a CD that is stuck on repeat this has been done before. It's not anything meeeew! Cow 🐄
I hope before anyone makes this decision, they pass by the medical pros and cons to look at the insurance actuaries. Deaths are up 40%.
Nobody cares anymore and they don’t have Trump to hate on so how about Hillary for being the treasonous pig that she is? Then maybe you’d win back a viewer or two.
Atlanta does not speak for the entire state thank god for the south the true rebels
Very soon now there will be hundreds of health officials saying "It was your choice, no one made you take it."
Georgia isnt scared
READ THE ROOM.
Who cares?
Lets go Georgia <3
Looks like I should move to Georgia
I think once people realize after they catch covid and recover from it, it is far better protection than a vaccine. That's why it has slowed down, and that's why it wont go any higher from here on out. Vaccine great for those older and immunocompromised, but once you catch covid and recover, you gravy.
Good for Georgia…….probably because blak folk can’t get an id….NO?  More like they are smarter than you liberals give credit
*CANADA and AMERICA are forced to have poison shoved into their body, their livelyhood and human rights taken from them. If people stand with Tyranny and Communism they themselves wish to be slaves and enforce slavery to their fellow peers.*
Cigarette smoking is estimated to cause the following: More than 480,000 deaths annually (including deaths from secondhand smoke) 278,544 deaths annually among men (including deaths from secondhand smoke) 201,773 deaths annually among women (including deaths from secondhand smoke). - CDC website   If any of this was about about health then certain issues would not exist anymore. You can legally buy cigarettes at a store and kill yourself and others (through second hand smoke). This is *NOT* about health. This is about compliance and control. This is no longer a conspiracy. This is factual.
Good So we dont get fucking killed bye the government
I live in GA.  Over the last 6 months, I have endured COVID-19 plus two chest colds that may have been Covid variants.  No vaccine and never been to the doctor, my natural immune system is self-evident.  Today I'm healthy, feeling good, and will never get the jab.
Fuck off with this bullshit... Good for you Georgia!!!
As a Georgian I thank everyone for their support it means a lot to us! I know our vaccination rate is a bit on the high end right now but we’re trying to bring it down to the triple digits soon so all that we need is patience.
https://youtu.be/6nSXHrmOy8o Big money grab
I could be completely wrong, but Im pretty sure Georgia is doing pretty well against covid, at least where I am at
Just a quick search shows that they are 8th on the list for most cases. This should be dove into further but just that 1 source says this content is bullshit. Would you like to CIRCLE BACK with information on how Georgia compares to states with 75% vaccination rates?
At least one State is not full of retards.
Staci Abrams can fix this. Let's elect her!
Im shocked comments arent turn off. Its like they are 95% of the time on these boogie man covid vids. We all gonna die from it.......rahhhhhhhhh. Ive had it 3 times now and its no more than a fucking over rated cold. My immunity is strong and well!!
https://youtu.be/F-MS6ArMmdY
Who cares?
I took two PFlZER shots. Came down with Covid. Lasted 17 days. I’m not getting a booster shot. I now regret getting the two PFlZER shots.
WOOOOOOO LETS GO GEORGIA ADD ANOTHER W TO THE LIST
Psalms 91:7; There shall no evil befall you, neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.  Psalms 91:7-10; A thousand shall fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; but it shall not come near you. Only with your eyes shall you behold and see the reward of the wicked. Because you have made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, your habitation; There shall no evil befall you, neither shall any plague come near your home.  I humbly pray Father, God also has highly exalted  the Anointed Savior’s, name, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Yeshua Mashiach (Jesus Christ) every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; praying God’s will be done! With thanksgiving to our Lord our Righteousness Father God! So be it! 🙏Amen!🙏 Amen!🙏🏼
Well this explains perfectly how Greene became their representative.  Clearly people are lacking in the critical thinking department in Georgia.
wow what a shocker
Our local news stopped reporting the “breakthrough” cases because they were equal to or even more than the unvaccinated most days.
And we’d like to keep it that way
I will never I repeat never get the vaccine
In the hinderlands of GA where a MTG can get elected, it is no surprise they don't want a life saving vaccine. The ignorance quotient is pretty high.
"Fewer shots going into arms" they are obsessed lol
Good!!!  Less brainwashed people!
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Georgia dude here, nobody gives a shit about the vaccine. People who've gotten and plan to get boosters don't bother anyone who isn't vaccinated. People don't bother each other over this crap. Honestly, Georgia has been pretty chill about the pandemic aside from when this all started.
“Why ya’all keep thinkin us southerners are ignant?”
Why we need FDA this corrupted Organization?
Heaven forbid they should make their own decisions! Propaganda is not news.
DISLIKE! THUMBS DOWN!
Micah 3:5-12  5 Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.  6 Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.  7 Then shall the seers be ahamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.  8 But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the Lord, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.  9 Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.  10 They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.  11 The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us.  12 Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.
Geaux Georgia
Good on yah Georgia! Hold the line.
So proud of Georgia!
and yet their cases and deaths don't seem to be any different than states with comparable populations.
Theyre choice. Shut the fuck up already
We're good. Fear mongering does not work in Ga.
Nobody here trusts the government and if you actually came down here and looked into our low income places which are everywhere you would have some insight as to why.
Those people are tired of getting shots and still getting sick. Pfizer is the only one profiting here. You shooters are just stuck being lab rats for the next 15 years. Good luck.
Probably cause they are smart
Stay pure, Georgia. I’m proud of you even though I don’t live there.
Covid scam
It’s time for the American people to stand up and fight for our Country, Our Freedom, Our Families Are We Want have a future. we also need to stand up for a constitutional rights as Americans.We are not a communist country so what gives the Democrats the right to in force something on to the people. It’s against our constitutional rights…..
Georgia is doing pretty well against covid
Revelation 9 New International Version 9 The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss. 2 When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace. The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss. 3 And out of the smoke locusts came down on the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth. It's a movie 🍿🎥  coming from ArchAngel Michael

Georgia is doing better than most states
Ok
Covid data is inflated bs
99% survived “covidL without treatment
The media is starting to sound, whiney
Engineer and Release. Follow the money trail there you fine the killers true Terrorism blood money. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I'm surprised Georgians got that right considering how wacky they are.
I could be completely wrong, but Im pretty sure Georgia is doing pretty well against covid, at least where I am at
Those worried should wear covid resistant haz mat suit ppe with helmet with filter and battery and leave everyone else alone. like: Powered air purifying respirator biovyrz air helmet by microclimate  Ne-1 helmet Air device helmet.  Air safe face shield.  Vihelm helmet  Aircube helmet 3m versaflo hepa filter helmet system...
Live in the 912, never took a shot or anything when covid became a thing , never got covid
When will the media fucking stop?
Madea don’t give a F.
P
Most people do not need a booster shot.
Should be zero
Really well Rhode Island has the second highest vaccinations and is now the the highest in Covid cases per capita well above Georgia in cases so what tf should that tell anyone with damn common sense hmmm
Georgians aren't so bad, when they're not stealing elections.
Let the Republicans reduce their own voter-count with misinformations and conspiracies hahaha.
Looks like Georgia has common sense. 👍🏻
By now, almost everyone has been vaccinated, had covid, or both.  This fear mongering over vaccination rates is sooo 2021.
Good for them.
Good! need no vaccine
Great job Georgia. Hold the line.
Meanwhile, 34,000 people in Georgia have died from Covid. Nice work.
We in Georgia will be glad to take a shot for a vaccine that works.. But so far, there is not one... Thus all the people who have gotten the  shot are still getting and distributing Covid. just as they are without the shot...
That is good news for the health of Georgians.  Funny how high vax states is where there is more illness.  Some say the vax actually increases you susceptibility to the disease.
Have a dislike!
But GA turned blue in 2020, you mean there is something wrong? Were we lied to?
Smart people👍🏻
Most Republican states are sick with their ICU filled with poorly educated sick people who refuse to wear face mask, keep going to parties, and refuse to get vaccinated.
Dam Pelosi stock is losing a few bucks and Pfizer bonuses will only be 40 mill instead of 50. Fauci get back on cnn and make up more garbage
Oh no! They are thinking for themselves and their freedoms! jo we are putting you in front of the teleprompter again! The fear gas is wearing off
That means people in Georgia are smarter than people in New York. The vaccine is only partially effective against the original Wuhan virus. You've seen it does nothing to the Omicron.
That means the smartest people in USA live in Georgia. If you think about it.
God I hope every one of these antivax idiots contracts Covid and gets the worst possible symptoms as punishment for their sheer stupidity.
Do Democrats still think 50% of unvaccinated covid positive people still get hospitalized? It seems so by this thread!!!
And yet despite this low vax rate, Georgia has below average new cases/death rate.  Seems like Georgians are making a good decision.
I miss the part where that’s my problem
Great - I’m a pure blood
Okay.
I live in Ga don’t bring that Covid bs down here , we are fine
Good 💉🧟‍♂️🖕😷
Why does this matter.
Nice
Vaccine acceptance is racism
Based freedom fighters
Go georgia!
Omincron is all the booster you need.  It cancels all other previous strains.
Probably lowest reinfection rate too…
Good.
thats cause theyre uneducated.
Put all the unvaccinated in internment camps till after the election,Democrats would vote yes for that,Foxtrot Juliet Bravo !
When are they going to make China pay for this
That’s cuz black people don’t trust the government and for good reason too
Fly by night scam
Ignorance abounds.
“Crack pipe Biden , No body wants your sons habits” check out this song by loza lol
Yet somehow these people miraculously are still alive, weird.  It's almost as if there's an extremely high survival rate.
Why is this BS still making news?
Do you believe that ANY disease is curable, without medicine? Do you believe that Jesus is the BEST doctor out there? He heals, He cures, and He delivers you from ALL oppressions! He healed me from depression…without EVER seeing a doc! For more healing evidences, check out Apostle Kathryn Krick’s videos on YouTube! God bless you all ❤️❤️❤️.
Stat strong Georgia and fight the power.
Georgia the smartest state all of a sudden nice….  👏
Why expect more is republicans
ok and? who cares if Americans die loo
W georgia
Arrest fascist fauci
Interesting change of narrative. Stop focusing how ineffective the jab is and start focusing on how few people have been duped to get it. It’s almost like an admission of defeat. Sorry, your propaganda didn’t work on more of us, media.
It’s time to move past Covid
You can get as many vax shots as you want. They don’t work. We want our money back. Most have a money back guarantee and don’t ask you to sign your rights and life away.
Smart people in Georgia  !! Go dawgs !!
Georgia has one of the highest black populations in america. So what you gonna do democrats hunt them down and shoot vaccine darts into their necks
Dang Georgia covid cases are also down a lot this month too
No one cares
Clearly Georgia didn’t and does not need a vaccine. We stayed open during the plandemic and have a surplus of money. We have a booming economy compared to the rest of the country. We know not to trust government and big pharma. Georgia will be just fine without the poison they’re trying to push on everyone.
Did I ask ?
I Positive Omicron But I get treatment from government . Thanks
If nobody took it then all this would go away
Awesome state!
Good on them! They don't want to be another statistic on the VAERS system.
Natural immunity....not being counted.
Who cares?
The interesting storyline is how many work for our are related to someone at the CDC which is in Georgia. This was short but interesting.
Ben dover
right nobody cares about vaccine anymore due to severe side affect. Make america great again.
Georgians are smart.
We are all moving to Georgia!
Low # of sheep as well
For one day black cats outta the bag lol or she’s back dang god hope she’s gone cry baby always followed and probably still does
Georgia won’t have side effects or long term damage. Yay Georgia!
Maybe they are more aware of the dangers there...much smarter people.
This is the 👎 button
Honestly, the narrative is dead.   No one cares about your stupid vaccines.
One day Pfizer cries about not making as much money as projected. The very next day they’re pushing more boosters. This is all about money.
And Israel is among the most vaccinated, and experienced high rates a few weeks ago. So what’s your point?
The people in Ga are smart!!!
Yeah that’s because people in GA are illiterate and stubborn asf.   I can say that because I unfortunately wasted 6 years of my life in GA.
Screw the vaccine  It’s evil 😈
Screw this vaccine  It’s evil 😈
Well if it’s the dump supporters keep it that way
Who cares? Other than the last election, Georgia is an absolutely useless state.
Hell yes Georgia!
Who cares? Get vaccinated or don't, it doesn't affect me. I had Covid twice and got the J&J. I won't be doing anything else at all. You can boost and mask my dead body after you kill me. Omicron was a gift to humanity.
Hell yeah
No one cares anymore let it out.
“Fully vaccinated”. The moving target that never stops moving.
W GEORGIA
Who cares?
Good for Georgia!
imagine being forced to take the shots just to attend school.  so much freedom
Lmfaooo lets go
Shaming and bullying are only acceptable for Neo-Libs to do...no one else is allowed. It's the only way they can succeed lol
We are not afraid!
Cause Walking Dead could start there.
Good for Georgia
Great job, GA! No need for these shots
And this is one of the reasons why I am eventually going to go to the uk 🇬🇧 and become a citizen there.
Well done Georgia!
Make it stop!
People are done receiving the lies of the vaccine having anything to do with stopping the spread of Covid and are daily seeing the horrific vaccine injuries occurring. Time to move on to returning to pre-Covid life, but we are unfortunately stuck with Joe as president. What a disaster he has been in one short year as the president.
Even if you request to have these kinds of videos removed from your feed, they still *recommend* you to watch them.   LMAO
Who cares
Can’t we all just for once not make thinks political right wing extremists, and left wing extremists I see you as well.
Nobody cares
Good. Let them make their own choices.
Georgia is #9 in total deaths, but let's not get vaccinated....dur mur gur mur seestur iz mur wyfuh
We don’t want to get the booster I don’t see a point
Lots of black folks live in GA. THEY remember the Tuskegee experiments.
Georgia probably also has fewer cases of myocarditis.
They not stupid
Enough!  Nobody cares about this nonsense anymore.  Move on to the next globalist hoax.   Climate change… isn’t climate change back on the hoax table?
Go Georgia ‼️
Bunch of dummies.
I don’t care about your vaccine status as long as I’m not paying for your hospitalization costs
I was forced or lose a very high paying job.
Good
Mark 5:34 And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.
Good, my state is keeping it real
smart people in Georgia
That’s because they’ve seen the guidestones.. and have brains in their head.
The part to me that's a joke is how creative the media has been the last 2 years to keep this shit relevant...
based
Well now the CDC finally acknowledges natural immunity works better. Took them long enough to. It’s been known about since victorian times. Lol   And now the scientists have crunched the data and found (using Sweden as the control group) that the lockdowns/mandates only lowered the death rate from the virus by point two percent —basically zero.   So ya getting back to normal life is supported by the real science.
Seems Georgia believes the lies less than everywhere else.
Georgia #1
COVID vacuum 😜
And your gonna say Biden won the election in Georgia but people won’t get vaccinated in Georgia. Get outta here.
I go to the University of Idaho. Idaho is a very conservative state but the university is about 5 minutes away from Washington so our university is heavily influenced by Washington liberals. The county I live in doesn't have a mask mandate, but the university does. It's a bunch of balogni
Betting non vaxxers who don't want the chemical in their bodies .....smoke cigarettes and vape.  At least 80%. And I'm good with no mandates.   And a vaccination card is required for ER admission.
Sic semper tyrannis
Georgia is near the lowest on everything. .... IQ levels, education level, common sense, etc.  Except for Mississippi maybe.   And Bangladesh.  They should actually be proud.  geez.
Glad to see people see how ridiculous boosters are.
2 Timothy 2:24-25 As the Lord’s servant, you must not quarrel. You must be kind toward all, a good and patient teacher, who is gentle as you correct your opponents, for it may be that God will give them the opportunity to repent and come to know the truth.
There are cases when HIV is injected with booster and if you don’t believe me just google it
2 Chronicles 7:14 Then if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and restore their land.
So
Covid is fixing stupidity in the Red States.
TIFFANY DOVER???
NEVER TRUST THE GOVERNMENT
DONT mess with Georgia
Rightfully so. #FearMongers
Luke 15:10 In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.  Matthew 3:8 Do those things that will show that you have turned from your sins.  Acts 3:19 Repent, then, and turn to God, so that He will forgive your sins.  Luke 17:3 So watch what you do! “If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him."
I wonder if the Georgia Guidestones have anything to do with it.
Matthew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach his message: “Turn away from your sins, because the Kingdom of heaven is near!”  Proverbs 28:13 You will never succeed in life if you try to hide your sins. Confess them and give them up; then God will show mercy to you.
Looks like the shot does not really work as they would like for us to believe it does.
fewer people vaxxed means more dead people - most of them Republican. this means more votes available for Democrats
4The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers so they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. 5For we do not proclaim ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake. 6For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,”b made His light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.c
2 Corinthians 4:1-3 1Therefore, since God in His mercy has given us this ministry,a we do not lose heart. 2Instead, we have renounced secret and shameful ways. We do not practice deceit, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by open proclamation of the truth, we commend ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God. 3And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.
Hell no. F*ing gremlins.
I will never again take a Vaccine.
Sorry but you guys are supposed to be smart, you went to college.  People are becoming immune because they are getting the virus so at that point vaccines are not necessary! Do your homework! Vaccination rates aren’t the whole story!!!
At this point we have to subscribe to shots every three to six months which only protect from serious illness and death if we want to stay up to date with the vaccination game.   We can all spread it, vaxxed or not. It’s up to the individual to keep themself healthy enough to not die from Covid, or to self isolate.
So what? Shouldn't you be talking about the number of cases per capita, or maybe the number of deaths, since those things actually matter?  We've already seen that vaccines don't reduce transmission.
Dislike Button
Then why are Democrats so intent on controlling Georgia?
Nobody cares
The smartest people in the country live in Georgia.  Go Georgia
Go Georgians!
Covidiots💯
Does it matter if Georgia is no better or worse than other states when it comes to cases, hospitalizations and deaths??
Omg who freaking cares?
Cause no one cares
People are waking up finally. The jab doesnt prevent jack it just makes them millions.
Meh. Who cares anymore?  It’s only upsetting when they die and leave children behind. Or when they fill up hospitals so heart attack patients can’t be admitted etc.   If they aren’t creating orphans or killing people with other medical emergencies then they are perfectly in their rights to decline a vaccination.   If you believe in conspiracy theories then the shot feels like a real threat. We have to give them their freedoms based on their own beliefs. As long is it doesn’t kill/harm innocents.
I'd be more understanding of vaccine mandates if the vaccine stopped the spread of the virus. Because it only mitigates symptoms (and may not even do that, especially with the new variants), and because of the horrible side effects it may cause, both the benefits and risks of this vaccine are primarily individual. The individual thus must be the one who makes the choice. For collective decision making to be defensible there must be a collective impact being addressed. Right now there is not. You are equally likely to catch COVID from a vaccinated or unvaccinated person. The vax might reduce your risk of a severe illness but that's for you to decide cause you can still get it and you can still pass it on.
Fuck ya vaccines
Ridiculous human beings wanting to control other human beings…GTFO
Not surprised😂 👨‍🌾🤠
Lol nah ill never get that shit
It's been 2 years. Time to resume life.
Stick yourselves with those jabs. I'd rather have omicron then another fauci ouchie.
I've always been for vaccines. The mandates, propaganda, disinformation, censorship, and coercion is what made me skeptical of this one. Government sure is acting like they have something to hide. If there is no ulterior motive than a little bit of transparency would go a long way in convincing the vaccine hesitant that it is safe and effective. If, on the other hand, this is depopulation, a corporate money grab, or some other "conspiracy theory" it would explain why they are shoving it down our throats so hard. In short, those pushing the vaccine mandates the hardest are either evil or stupid because if they were good and smart they'd realize this BS is what is making people fear the vaccine. If the vax really is safe and effective the ruling class needs to start acting like it and put some skin in the game. Get rid of liability protections, stop the censorship and end the mandates.
Over 924K people have died from Covid.  Nearly all were unvaccinated.
Inbred states dont have high I.Q's
hmm i wonderrrr whyy
Weird how Georgia has about the same infection and hospitalization rates as rest of USA.  The vaccine must work in mysterious ways.
Simply fascinating....now back to my nap.
You would think, if vaccines made a significant difference to infections and death, the "curve" of the disease would be noticeably higher and wider than states with higher vaccination rates. It is not.
A lot of people got the first two doses already so covid isn't spreading as rapidly in Georgia as it is in a lot of actual red states because the GA govts have actually done a decent job keeping the misinformation out of GA politics outside of the far south and northern regions of the state.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates—🎈
Those who got it ; got it. Now lift the stupid mandates.
stop worrying about georgia.........they are really worried about the $$$$$$ that they didnt make
Don’t take the poison folks!
The news can take a giant dildoooo and shove it down its throat. Stupidasses
Ever notice how covid is low n gets all the attention? Yet more are dying from drugs n alcohol and they are promoting those??
And..
based georgia
KING JESUS CHRIST is returning. Please repent of your sons and get right with GOD. He is the Way the Truth and the Life. He knows your name, your problems and your sorrows. Turn to LORD JESUS.
Georgia has some smart citizens
But they failed to show their actual covid numbers to prove that you do not need it
Whats fully vaccinated? Is it the amount that fauci wants? Because he has flip flopped alot lately
Vax is a joke! So glad I didn’t get it. All of you long term will regret ever listening to those fools. None of you noticed how the records on exactly what’s in it are sealed for 50 years ? Why’s that? That’s so nobody in this lifetime can be held responsible.
Because it doesn’t work except to give stroke or heart attack and reduce human existence
Not that Georgia cares much about facts or ever did, but Covid cases and deaths are still significant. So, congradulations, you've retained the "freedom" to die. Maybe you should change your state motto to "Georgia, a great place to die from a preventable disease."
I wonder why 🤔
There's only seven states that have more dead than Georgia,that not great!
The vaccine is a joke real trap it’s all about control
Let’s Go Darwin!
Awesome! F$&@ that useless jab!
Maybe cause people are starting to view this as a fucking joke, that never ends.
goodjob georgia!
Georgia is the smartest one so far.
My Dad died from covid in March 21. I felt it was my civic duty to get vaccinated to protect others. I caught covid about 5 weeks ago. It was bad. I thought I was dying. Fastforward to today and I'm still having shortness of breath, headaches, lightheaded, joint pain, deaf, and the most ridiculous sore throat ive ever had. My friends that didn't get the shot lost taste and ran a fever for 2 days. WTH. I was lied to, and people in media covered up the lies. They also shot down and ruined careers of those who did stand up.
Good shit Georgia!  - Your neighbors in SC
Smart people....
Unvaccinated people can catch and spread corona, vaccinated people can catch and spread corona. What’s the point of a vaccine mandate at this point?
God BLESS Georgia! 👍
Georgia sucks
And we are doing GREAT here in Georgia. I live here and we live our lives normally. I love the choices georgia has made for our state. They’ve done a GREAT job protecting our rights and freedoms I love Georgia! ❤️
Who cares at this point.
There's got to be a way to blame the former administration for this.
So if we follow the science... To protect the protected from the unprotected, we need to force the unprotected to protect themselves using the same protection that doesn't protect the protected...
They don’t want it! Leave them a lone! Besides, the worst of the disease is behind us.

Every person I know who has or has had Omicron (and I know several) are all previously VACCINATED!! Every person I know who has NOT gotten the vaccine has not even had COVID....PERIOD. Do the math.
there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.
figures...
Great for Georgia! No I want to see the infected Covid numbers compared to infected flu numbers!
Let's Go Darwin!
I absolutely cannot wait to get boosted!  Getting my booster has been on my mind for over 2 years now. I really need to stop beating around the bush and get it done.  It is a really big responsibility to get boosted. Dont do it for just your self or your job that would be selfish. Do it for your family, friends, and even your neighbors. (Especially your neighbors...!)  I just haven't decided which booster to choose quite yet. You would think that two years would definitely be long enough to decide which brand of booster  or boosters is right for me.  There is just so many booster companies on the market to choose from now.  Let's see starting one of the first companies to come to mind H.K.S., Garrett, Precision, Borg Warner, True North, even Ebay has boosters available.  Originally I only wanted a single booster, but now I'm really warming up to the idea of forced compound boosters, that way I would have a better chance at surviving against all these factory created supercharged monsters.  What? Forced Injections?   I thought we was talking about Forced Induction....!
Love my state.
WOO!! HOO!! Makes me proud to be a Georgian!!........An UNVAXXED Georgian!!! I'm proud to share a state with so many independent thinkers!!!  👍
Live here in Georgia, most people may not be vaccinated but most still abide by masking indoors. There’s still some that don’t but for the most part a lot of businesses require it and people abide by it, at least in Atlanta. I think that’s helped a lot tbh.
I love how they track vaccine rates like it's some kind of market share but do not track, nor report vaccine effectiveness rates! Report on the amount of vaccinated people who still got covid and still did not die. Line up thoses numbers. But you cannot and wont. It would just expose your lies!
Nobody cares
That's because their not stupid
FDA Executive on vaccines for toddlers https://youtu.be/6nSXHrmOy8o
Fun fact, for all those applauding Georgia on their vaccine hesitancy, Georgia had the 10th highest COVID death rate for 2021. It is interesting that the state with the lowest percentage of people who have been fully vaccinated (Alabama) also had the highest COVID death rate for 2021 which was nearly twice the national average. Wonder if that's a coincidence. All because these snowflakes are either too scared to get a vaccine with now nearly 2 years of safety data, too stubborn to admit they were wrong, too ignorant to understand they are wrong, or too callous to care about the burden of the unvaccinated on the healthcare system and those around them.
Damn right.
Covid down over 60% and they are still trying to scare us. Come on and just get back to doing the news. The media will milk this even if there are ten cases left. The public is tired of the lies, the BS, and all the scare tactics.
Good for Georgia!
Government always relying on scar tactics. They want to keep the masses in Fear.
Moving there
There's a very good reason that people who live in states like Georgia  always find themselves listed  on or close to  the bottom of things that make America great
Georgians are really smart people!
The Coronavirus Will Be The End Soon.
No surprise, my state is a living L
Good. You fuckers have been pushing this for too long. Everyone who has it got it already. So leave the rest of the people alone
Looks like people from Georgia are pretty smart they caught on to the fact the jab ain’t about the virus
it's been a lie to lead you into AI world transhumanism....
Glad the folks of my state are resistin' the pressure
And.... so fucking what! Do a story on Clinton and her shenanigans, you know real new 😒
If people are still getting vaccinated of course the number of vaccinated people will go up but the number of the people who are going to take the vaccine will decrease   Is my math wrong????
So proud of my home state. Stick it to the man.
Georgia???  No way. I’d never guess. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
They don’t work 🤣🤣🤣🤣 so yeah good luck
All the proof you need to not get jabbed https://youtu.be/6nSXHrmOy8o
Why can't people defecate on the sidewalk? It's an affront to the Constitution! It's my feces, and not my problem if someone else gets sick from it, right imbeciles?
see yall on herman cain award
Lol this is dumb
Georgia remains among lowest for vaccine administration nationwide..no shit only thing that lives their is stupidity and outdated people ready to be terminated.
And?
No one wants your Zombie Vaccine.
Georgia should fare well in the upcoming months and years.
Wow
the pandemic is basically over call it something else
Good for Georgia. They are ahead of the curve in understanding the scamdemic.
Please GFY Pfizer.
Link
Good for them. Just 2 days ago we had an employee pass out after getting the booster, it was an extremely dangerous situation luckily his fall protection harness saved him. More people have been out sick from getting these shots since the beginning of all this crap. Think for yourself before you let the government into your veins.
Nice
Media keeps the scam going for global masters.
Good🙌🏽
They aren’t stupid in the South.  They don’t scare easily like the northern states.
Ecclesiastes 1:9  9 The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.
Good for Georgia.
i live in Georgia we don't even have mask mandates in my town and most people are actually happy so all i have to say and you can quote me on this "screw the C0v!d vaccine before you know it it will be just like a flue shot!!!" ps spelt it wrong on purpose to emphasize how stupid this all is
And Georgia remains among the highest for common sense
Let it go. You’ve lost.
And yet…. Georgia doesn’t have wide spread outbreaks.  Weird….
Go Georgia!!
Keep up the good work Georgia!  Show the rest of the nation that you're AWAKE AND DO NOT SUBMIT to EVIL SCHEMES!!!!
Good for them
Michigan and Georgia have 10 million people. In Michigan 68 percent of the people are vaccinated vs Georgia’s 53 percent. Yet Michigan has more Covid deaths. Lol
IT’S NOT A VACCINE..STFU
Flu weaponized by attaching it to spiked protein to cling to the masks
fuck you Georgia . get your shit together ...
Good!! Yeah because wer all SICK and injured from your injections!!!!!! Gahh!!!!🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
Who cares?
Good for you Georgia!!
11 Alive is nothing more than lefty propaganda just look at what these shills put out in the past.. Absolute Garbage and.. LET'S GO BRANDON !!
based
As a Texan, I’m proud of you Georgians ✊🏻. No need for that bullshit
So what
Yahoo! Go Georgia! We don't need your Media fear mongering booster shots.
Woah. Your next headline should be, “Alabama has the lowest gay marriages.” Or maybe even the fuc**in “sky is blue today.”
Seek truth fellow internetters. You are not alone.
I'm from Seattle and I came to visit my Family in Georgia. While I visited I noticed nobody wearing masks so I went to get my booster. I SPENT 2 HOURS WAITING IN LINE AT WALGREENS! !AND I HAD AN APPOINTMENT! I yelled, I made a scene, I never got my shot. I told them they should be ashamed as I walked out.
Maybe because they don't work?
GO GEORGIA!!!!! 🇺🇸
I guess I’m moving to Georgia. Most of the intelligent people are over there it seems. The rest of you can burn in covid hell.
I'd rather live in other countries than anywhere south of like Maryland lmfao
Why do blacks refuse to get the jab??
Yet some how Georgia sits 15th in deaths from Covid PER CAPITA, while VERY vaccinated states like New Jersey (#3) and New York (#8) Massachusetts (#12) are all in the top 10 most vaccinated states and all have more deaths PER CAPITA than Georgia. This video should be titled: Despite incredibly low vaccination administration, Georgia deaths are still lower than many highly vaccinated states.
Who gives a shit. Fuck off
"(for) COVID-19 (,) Georgia remains among lowest for vaccine administration nationwide" so let's #ConvinceItForward
Only Georgia is on the forefront fighting against the elitist, if we could only be like them.  My support goes to all of you Georgians who are destroying greedy investors revenue streams being made off of booster shots.
Georgia remains a hell of a nice place to live! Fuck Biden, fuck fauci and fuck the MSM!!!!
Arrest fauci
My body my choice 😀 i didn't get any vacine and I am healthy and hungry 💪💪
What’s the point? got both shots still got Covid.
Go Georgia
I'm in GA and not vaccinated. Will not vaccinate till forced to, trollolol
If Big Pharma didn't know that the vax would lose efficacy in only a few months, then how do they know what the side effects will be 2 years out?
Good for Georgia
Yay geogia
And a huge death rate.
Georgia has among the highest drop out rate for high school and college students so the people there aren't very smart, anyway. We can afford to lose a few people from Georgia as they aren't going to benefit society with their presence. Just use up our tax dollars and resources.
Poison
That's because of FREEDOME
Still talking about this huh
Why is this news? Folks keep getting and spreading Covid with the jab. What’s the point anymore? Looks like the people are sick of all the nonsense.
Did that affect the number of Covid cases or will the media only give us the information it wants to in order to cause false concern
the supreme court already ruled against biden, face it and roll on
We just ignore it till it goes away. Like a annoying kid telling bad jokes.
All those WS POC, Why would they not trust our government. I mean our vice president said she wouldn’t take it if a certain person wasn’t in office maybe that was the beginning of the doubt they have
I'm a lifetime liberal, who's highly-educated, and lives in Savannah GA. I skipped all C19 vaccines and focused on making sure my immune system could handle Covid with crazy stuff like Vit D and Zinc...I (like everyone else) had Omicron recently and it was a breeze. Having moved here from NYC back in 2018,  It's been so amazing to live in a city and state that didn't close down, enforce masking, or stigmatize people for having very reasonable objections for taking a legit experimental vaccine!
245,000 views only 562 likes.  Enough propaganda. We are over this putting each person against each other.
Good for them
Whoops. Georgia. HERE THEY COME !!! You guys gonna get the attention from the ones above.
Smart people in Georgia! Say, fake news why are you avoiding the breaking news of TREASON on our 45 th POTUS? You helped so I assume you will just ignore until the cuffs come for you?
Notice the number of comments and the theme of most of the comments? Yah, the trash is over with. On with life
Which translates into fewer heart attacks from Fauci’s secret juice for Georgia…. This great news!
Hell ya! Let's go GA. We stand for freedom!
I’m not surprised lol
Go Dawgs!!!
Who cares
You may have noticed there are two conflicting narratives being told simultaneously that attempt to explain the stagnation in vaccination rates: 1. That the vaccine is readily available to everyone who wants it, but there are many people who are stubbornly choosing not to take it -- because the people are supposedly stupid/uneducated/misinformed 2. That the vaccine is only readily available to the "privileged"  and that most people who really need it want it but can't get it -- because the "system" is supposedly discriminatory
Just a reminder that the US Covid death toll is 3x that of US death toll in WW2 and the blood is on the hands of media corporations spreading anti-vaccination misinformation to a population that is repressed by capitalism's unnecessary hardship and desperate for a purpose in life
This is fake news: Georgia is among the highest for vaccine administration nationwide.
Blacks don’t want jabs
https://youtu.be/RB2shlIZkyY
Huge Georgia W
And?
Oh word, they left the comments open lol
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
It's going war for human souls. We are in the End Times. 🙏 Turn to the LORD before it's too late.. 🙏 Jesus is the only way to GOD and heaven.
TIL Georgians are smarter than pretty much everyone else
Go Georgia!!
Can someone please tell me what fully vaccinated means? How many shots is that
Just STFU, media are the most hated people in America
And fewer deaths and fever hospitalizations so yeah the fear mongering failed. Awww poor establishment snowflakes are big mad.
Take yo clot vaccines ill stick with out any vaccines
Woooo Hell yeah! They’re going strong too!
Oh, how I love taking my dog for walks and watching the grass grow.  She's so happy.
What's the weather in Atlanta today?  It's cold up here in Park Slope Brooklyn NY.
People are waking up
https://youtu.be/6nSXHrmOy8o  No thanks
Good for GA! Stand strong! Why so much pressure to take an experimental jab?
Stop with your democratic BS. I haven't gotten it I have never worn a mask nor vaxxed. I have cancer through whole thing. Worked around sick people through it All so stop the BS
No matter how wonderful and detailed a man's plan may or may not be, the result is in God's hands. In his heart a man plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps! Book of Bible, Proverbs 16:9)
It also has the highest rate of the 13%
To everyone : Fear God and give him glory because the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heavens, the earth and the springs of water. (Book of Bible, Revelation 14:7) As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. "Tell us, they said, " when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of age?" Jesus answered, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains !(Book of Bible, Matthew 24:3,7-8) Jesus began to preach, for the kingdom of heaven is near  !( Book of Bible,Matthew 4:17)
Eeewwwww be scared, be scared!! Lol at the graph, look at the graph...be scared..ppppfff GTFOH!  Your scare tactic ain't working anymore..at least on people with a brain
MEET GOD WITHIN 🙏
It’s useless don’t get it.  More money for big pharma
Black folks don’t get vacc’d
Well done, Georgia, well done.  I'm sure the liberal precincts such as Atlanta proper are amongst the highest as that is where the cowardly dwell.
I guess people listened to all the Democrats that were saying they wouldn't take a vaccine developed by Trump administration.
Go GA!! I've never been more proud of our GA residents! Those who have resisted, keep it up!! 😀
Moving to Georgia!!!
Buy my children's book on Amazon called: Hey Mon, Cool It.
Lies, lies and more lies. Now that Bill Gates fohndation exceeded the 400 billion mark and the scum tax sucking politicians have recieved all their kickbacks ofcourse they are going to tell us the numbers of this Chinese man made virus is going down just so they can say, See, the poison shots worked.
How are we still talking about Covid?  The Media just won't let it go
"If you have to be persuaded, reminded, pressured, lied to, incentivized, coerced, bullied, socially shamed, guilt-tripped, threatened, punished and criminalized ... If all of this is considered necessary to gain your compliance -- you can be absolutely certain that what is being promoted is not in your best interest." - Ian Watson
The home of MTG...go figure. It's their choice to get the vaccine...with or without the proper knowledge...but then again what is proper knowledge?? The truth is what that individual wants to believe.
Boost these nuts

The miraculous human body is capable of creating its own vaccine for any virus 🙏❤ utube Andrew Norton webber miracle of distilled water-nsearch radio. Go to forty minutes of video for information on how to cure all viruses.
the highest for STDs as well
Don’t do it, trust in your immune system. Take preventive measures to increase or maximize your immune system. It’s not worth the short or long term risk of side effect including death. So why not just wait until you naturally catch it and deal with the covid risk only? Instead of possibly having to deal with two sets of deadly risk.
Great we like freedom of choices!!!!!!!!!!
before the vaccine. wwasnt georgia doing really well in numbers?
You think people are starting to see through the big lie of "covid"?
Based.
meanwhile third world countries don’t have even have vaccine options
Georgia doesn't wanna play ball huh? We gonna have to fix that
They probably have the lowest percentage of people dying from heart attack
Keep on being them “good ol boys” smh.
Hank Aaron
This report brought to you by Pfizer.
Got damn right!  Government injections: turns out they were not safe nor effective
Go Dawgs!
they don't wear mask here either.
yay Georgia smart people there
Good stay strong everyone.
Everything the left claims, pushes or supports turns out to be wrong when the truth comes out.  If your government supports it you should fight it vehemently.
What about Sputnik
No one trust's the deep State and the Beast's lead demon
Wait a minute. More than half of GA are jabbed all the way? We’re stressing over boosting? Give me a break. There’s no story here or no “cause of concern”
The mosquitoes in Georgia are the size of bats and as hungry as vampires. I would be more cautious there of malaria.
So many things to report about and you choose to report on people who don’t have the vaccine. Anyone vaccinated shouldn’t be scared of unvaccinated people it’s why we got the vaccine right ? You media have me lost
That's awesome, go Georgia!
The USofA is well on its way to 1,000,000 dead. Why is there 90% compliance on seat belt use? Only 31,000 deaths per year there? On the way to ICU most antivaxers have second thoughts.
Nobody needs fucking boosters you freaks live your life!!
The Covid lie is widely known.  We will never take the poisons of liars.
I live in New Jersey. It was a nightmare. So many restrictions
Y'all's funerals, not mine.  You've been warned for years now.
Russiagate
Fuck that poison
Good.
but Georgia voted for Biden so why arent they doing what Biden wants?  its not like it is a Trump state lol
No one believes you anymore. Stop lying. No one wants to give their money to billionaires for snake oil cures!-). Tell it like it is or go f yourself
Well a new study said this shot has a negative efficacy against omicron.  Paper still needs to be peer reviewed but if it is the case no one should be getting boosters.
Because people are waking up
Good. Keep it that way.
Side effects are worse from the jab than not even talking it and letting ur immune system handle it self
Black people learned from Tuskegee
Yeah Georgia has the most republican hick retards
They are simply the smartest
Because literally EVERYONE got sick with omicron right after the new year whether they were vaccinated or not…so what’s the point of boosters and more boosters?! This is getting ridiculous at this point
Good work Georgia!!!!! Keep it up
MAJOR GRATITUDE GEORGIA
stop calling it a vaccine,,,its not  ,we call it false advertising ,, snake oil is what it is
We are done with COVID. You scumbag journos must want some HONK.
Don’t trust it
Smart people in Georgia.
People still talking about this nonsense??? We can move on now, thank you!!!!
Coming soon:  "Scientists baffled as Georgia has fewer heart attacks in young adults than the rest of the nation"
WE can smell a rat from a mile away. Not happening.
192,000 views and only 399 likes…?  Great job on the recommended videos and  removal of the dislike counter YouTube, you soy boy beta cucks
Lol
200,000 views and only 396 likes. 🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣
That's a decision for the people of Georgia. We have a federal system of government. States have wide-ranging rights. The Federal focus should be on making sure as few tax dollars as possible go to Covid-related care. We now have vaccines. People shouldn't have to take them. But the Federal tax-payer shouldn't have to bear the financial brunt of any Covid-related illnesses that the unvaccinated may incur.
Yikes. With 60k covid deaths in January 2022 alone- it is a real shame how they will not vaccinate. I thought Georgia was mostly Christian and valued life.
Smart people in Georgia
I LOVE GEORGIA!!!! SOVEREIGN VANGUARD!!!!!
Good. Dont take rhe shot
It's nice seeing some states remaining strong and avoiding an experimental drug when it has been proven to not stop any thing.
Thia just in. Black people dont and never have trusted big brother. Shocking i know 🙄🙄🙄. How is this news??? Lol. Im not even black. And anti race baiter. But come on.  Why the hell would they trust yall to inject them??  After what youve already done to them??? You actually thought they woukd be up for the jab??? Hell even rhe white folks dont want it. Thats should tell ya right there lol.
They ain’t too bright down there.
I see a few people upset that some people chose a different option for their health than they are being pressured to take. You people need to get a life. Georgia is doing fine, why are you so obsessed about other people's chpices they make for *their* bodies?
Based.
George's very smart it does not want the federal government messing with their people you do not see what's happening do you you do not see the ideology that's going on do you why can you not see it
https://youtu.be/6nSXHrmOy8o
Great job GEORGIA! We were able to maintain order and stability here because we didn't go as crazy as the other places. From what I can see our grocery stores and economy are A okay because of it.
And yet less covid deaths than pretty much any other state along with Texas and Florida
That just means Georgia are the smartest people in our country
Why would anyone want to take an Experimental shot.
Good
And their case rate is average. The vaxx is defective.
Good job Georgia! Smart. The media is just pushing fear and hate! Enough! Back to FREEDOM!
Awesome news maybe they’ll destroy inventory soon when it expires
It’s adverse effects are stronger than advertised and it’s far far less effective.   Don’t give in to coercion like I did.  Hold the line
The booster leaves you with a cough you can not get rid off. Do not waste your time.And the news is the best liars of all times.
Is that graph like the one the WH used to show the drop in gas prices where if you look at it dropped way down but if you look real close it dropped 2 cents? People don't want to be experimental test dummies in Georgia
After seeing how the media lies to the people why would anyone believe anything these people are saying .
Why vax if you still get covid?🤡 they ain’t with all that bullshit y’all forcing on us
Next, we talk with Pfizer ceo about how he’s going to improve profits next quarter   Later, why your infant needs a booster, and is your family safe if your pets remain unvaccinated?
Who cares?
Georgia still in their losing ways it seems.
They said 1 shot. I say no shots
Go Georgia. Resist.
Superbowl
I blame Atlanta
Never more proud to be a Georgian
what happened to the data right after 11/21? the blank spot.. someone lost all the data.
Do people still believe the lying with statistics? Like just come on america, the gig is up
The civil war is over, move on Georgia.  Death from stupidity is high in Georgia. Stop watching Fox News.
Good job Georgia! Keep sticking it to these swamp creatures!
And if that little psychopathic elf Fauci wants to come down to Atlanta, we'd be more than glad to give him a super booster vaccine. Up the ass 😅🤣😂🇺🇸
The news is now about getting a booster shot verses “Covid” deaths, “Covid” related hospitalizations, or Covid positive numbers.
Good Georgia. Now do something about your real disease. The rampant far left voter fraud!
NOBODY is "fully vaccinated."   That is either "misinformation" or "disinformation", perpetrated by the media and bureaucracy.
They can push their scary numbers around all they want, but if they come knocking on my door with a needle in their hand...  They will experience the meaning of frontier justice
Just tell the truth... You're targeting the melanated community! I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but everybody know the truth now, so y'all can stop making yourselves look and sound stupider than you already have... It's just comedy at this point! But you have a job to do so carry on! 🤦🏽‍♂️  #JustSayNoToDrugs
They fail to mention that the case rate is just about exactly average for the US in GA, even with the low vax rate.   It's almost like....   It makes no difference at all.   Hmmm...   Funny, that.
Nice to

I think it's time to put an end to this charade. The Covid experiment was a reason to to force the vaccine. The horrific effects of the vaccine are now undeniable. Soon the world will know the truth, and many will be devastated by the decisions they've made for themselves and their families.
Did it really take all that just to figure out nobody wants them
Take your booster ass shots on somewheres else nobody wants them
They realized the definition of "vaccine" has been changed. Along with dozens of other words that used to mean one thing and are now meaningless.
No surprise.
This administration has and still is running this country in the ground and they still trying to push this shit on people😂😂 typical stupid ass idiots
The vaccine is useless and us Georgians know it💯. Doesn’t prevent,cure it, and no it doesn’t lower the death rate you stupid idiots🤷‍♂️. Now again. Why take it???🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
My state South Carolina too!
Keep up the good work Georgia !!! 🤙🏻🙌🏼
Not to take away from Braves talent but they were able to practice all year and won the World Series. Shoot out to my home town ATL.
All of these Arrogancian  Eugenicist Billionaire  "Shot callers" who planned,bribed ,corrupted everyone possible to carry out this Genocidal Hoodwinkery with Total Luciferian Forethought, actually believe they have acquired the telomere Genetic tech and their going to be immortal? After killing Everyone? Really? Let me enlighten you. Once all the Wives and moms compare notes on the Death toll truth from your bullshit. They are going to be really pissed off in a collective kind a way. They are Going to reach in to their purses, and start returning pairs of Balls to the Men in the house look them in the eyes and say...Git to it!  And you Fkrs are gone,history,horizontally room temperature. That is Historically how Justified Revolutions and purgings of tyrannical  Governments full of "Women and Queens" are toppled.Like we have now. These Beta males aren't running things. Semper fi
Love GA lol ppl just live life as usual. I caught covid in GA no symptoms.
Chicken for Vaccine. Free bucket of chicken for every jab ;)
Beware, the WHO and elites have just created a new HIV variant which causes aids at a way faster rate. Please be advised, this happened shortly after a young woman cured herself from HIV with Natural Immunity. Covid is no different than every other government disease released to the public for political gains. Research, learn and protect your family. Fight tf back 🤷🏿
Georgia is doing the right thing Shame On whoever doesn’t think yes
Because people are getting real sick and tired of it all. This pandemic as turned into a political  tool to control peoples lives. If there is one thing we Americans will never put up with, it's being controlled. We have been jerked around and lied to about this pandemic from day 1 since this pandemic began. And and just about everyone is sick of it after 2 years and want their lives to return back to normal. This virus is never going away. it will become like every other virus out there and we'll just have to learn to live with it.
And oddly, Georgia has 95 percent of new hospitalizations are those same triple quadruple vaxxed people.   Will Pfizer be OK?
Aaaand the Darwin Award goes to Georgia. For turning down a safe, free vaccine that reduces the severity of covid and frees up ICU beds and heath care resources for those who truly need it. Way to be selfish 👍🏻
I bet most of you quoting Orwell have never read one of his books lol.
lmao "please get the vaccine!!" no lol i just dont go out in public, possibly endangering other people or myself
(From a Georgian) Even my doctor smiled and never said another word when I said "That shit ain't ever going to happen.
Good!   Now cover the reports that they're not doing anything positive.
Good
Goodddd, America's finally beginning to wake up🙏
Good on them!!! 👏
Georgia keeps Winning!
Good job Georgia!!!
Good
good for gorgia
Why do we still care for the unvaccinated? They get it? good. They don’t? Oh well. We’re all going to get covid eventually unvaccinated or not. We won’t be immune until we all get covid. Some will be fine, some will die. Humanity will adapt and continue. That’s what happens. it has for our entire existence. “BuT wE kNoW bEtTeR nOw”. People ate tide pods… 😑
so the democrats won georgia back in the election but somehow ranks lower than republican states in vaccinations? sounds like more evidence for a rigged election
good
Its because people are smart like me not to take thejabs...
God bless you truckers and all of the supporters! Stay safe and united!
STOP
Based Georgia. We should all be as smart as them.
Has muh Russia invaded muh Ukraine yet?
Practicing there own rights so let’s get off the goddamn shot train actually report real news not fake.
More fear mongering and BS.
No one cares. We all are getting covid and 99.99997 % are "surviving". You statistically have a higher chance of dying from malaria than covid so ya... let's move on to something else now.
They are smart. Pure Bloods.
👏🏼🎉
I love Georgia
At this point they’re really just trying to shame people
The reason why is obvious. The black community, due to infamous incidents like the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, don't trust the American medical establishment. Frankly, it appears their skepticism has merit.
Get up stand up! Those of us that haven't gotten it, don't want it. Stop pushing it, allow bodily autonomy and the freedom of choice our forefathers fought hard for!
Like who really give a rats ass
Goergians are the smart ones .
Where does every liberal want to go party? Florida,why because it’s a open state….except of course for the really rich liberals who go to the super bowl with 70 thousand people who are not wearing 😷.But they all feel safe because they knew on Monday when all the kids went to school they would have to be wearing them . 🤨
Good job Georgia way to lower the avg
The unvaccinated are destroying the economy.
Thank God i live in this beautiful red state.. We have paid zero attention to all the BS and have done exceedingly well this ENTIRE time. My businesses take me all over the country, and Georgia is one of the few states ive seen where life has been, is, and will continue to be normal.  Now if they could just lower all the prices back down to Trump era please. ✌️🇺🇸👍
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LETS GO!!!!
"Fewer numbers of Covid shots are going into arms."😂😂😂
Keep up the good work Georgians.My body belongs to me not the government.👁️
That’s good news. Good job Georgia!
In a few months, they'll have the lowest HIV cases.
Great Likes to Views Ratio... and Arent we done with the Plandemic Malarkee already..  why is there still covid news??
I bet the city dwellers are the highest boosted. Rural people don’t feel the need to get vaccinated or boosted simply because they are always around the same people. Same for Alabama. I’m not sure we can say too much else about it….
Woopdeefuckindoo
This is SO 2021....On with REALITY......
Good
Hell yeah brother
Probably highest IQ there.
I will never get a shot period out of these covid shots they are a joke
Georgian sound like really smart people
Stay out of Ga demons
Some how the state that turned BLUE has the lowest vaccine rate...    You expect me to think nothing shady happened during election.
Pls bring mask back it hides my face .. 😞 my siblings point my insecurities
Good for you Georgia!
Smart people! Stop pushing this ☠️! Ya gotta love this shill for big Pharma. It’s sickening!
why should I care?
It’s almost like people have realized the vaccine doesn’t work and the whole thing isn’t as scary as the tv said it was.
Bioweapon
Fake news. 🖕🏽the jab and the booster shot
This isn’t news.
Based Georgia
Smart people in Georgia!
Yeah Georgia is not as stupid as people think I only know one person vaccinated in the state by their own accord and he's a dumb ass Satanist. 2 nurses I know were hospitalized after first jab.. that's about all I know that took that poison.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
No one cares.
Well, at least Georgia is South of the 35th parallel, meaning generally speaking, they get enough sunlight for people to techinically produce enough vitamin D in the wintertime, unlike my state, which is north of that line, does not.  However, melanin, age, weight, & sugar consumption CAN impede one's vitamin D production.  And in case you missed it, Israel finally acknowedged the negative effects of vit D deficiency.  D is an immunoregulator, so it can both ratchet up the immune response or knock it down (esp in fighting autoimmune disorders).
🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🥳🥳🥳🥳 Don't poison your children and yourself 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
so proud of my state. Let’s keep it going y’all!
Stop injecting your bodies with poison! Look into the ingredients!
Georgia, Georgia...  Everyone's doing just fine Good old common sense keeps Georgia on my mind 🇺🇸
They are smart people in Georgia!!!
I GUESS A LOTTA PEOPLE IN GEORGIA ARE SAYING NO!   RESPECT FREEDOM OF CHOICE PEEPS! ✊🏻✋🏻💉
This story tells us nothing pertinent. . . .   And the results are showing ……???
the protected needing protection from the unprotected by forcing the unprotected to use the protection that doesn't protect the protected has nothing to do with science.
cool beans
Is the virus survival rate still 99.75 ??
Hopefully Arizona gets our numbers down too! Good job Georgia!
Yeehaw!!!  We’re proud of that, here in Ga!  I bet the libs are really upset, we’re possibly committing murder!  Now, if we can keep the greasy chicken lady away from our governors mansion we will be doing even better!
Go Georgia good job
Would like to see the dislikes lol man turns out boosters lower your immunity hmmmm maybe people are realizing they’ve been played. Some are…
Lowest vaccine stats and yet new cases are dropping at the same rate as the States with the highest vaccine ratings. 🤔 It’s almost as if it doesn’t prevent anything.
Who gives a fuck. Why don’t you talk about Russia for a week until that blows over
It’s pretty bad here. I got boosted and my mom texted me telling me that she was ashamed of me. So I just wear my N95 and hope that I don’t get Omnicron. Judging by the comments though, I don’t think it’s going to get any better any time soon.
“The horror!”
Oh no, good thing the disease kills 1/10 the number that obesity kills. Wonder why they don’t focus on making us not fat?
Whats in the shot?
I wonder why they didn't mention hospitalization or all cause death
Boosters do not work lolol its all a money and power grab for the powers at be
Georgia is the 8th highest state for COVID deaths; not quite number one. Keep up the good work
Georgia will have the highest population in 2 years.
I would get vaccinated but then I would have to live in fear of the unvaccinated.  I don’t need the extra stress.
I really hope the comments are being sarcastic… the fuck Georgia? Are y’all stupid or something?
Who is still getting these vaccines that don’t work??
Mandate. Man date. No
Proud to be from georgia
Emory is forcing all its student to get the booster, despite its own faculty published an article talking about risk of myocarditis from COVID vaccine in young male adults (the article is on JAMA, with an impact factor ~50, so highly credible)
Ok?
And? Mind your business.
Go Georgia! Good on you!
Who cares?
Good for Georgia! Stay that way!
good job GA
Based Georgia
They just refuse to let people be left alone huh? Can’t mind your own business can you? I seem to recall fall of last year Georgia had some of the lowest case rates of any other state according to a CDC map. So seem to be doing fine.
Yall are so miss informed its not even funny!! I'm glad 1 state in this pathetic country is standing for something right, i thought it was gonna be Tennessee honestly but georgia would have been my second guess, it's truly amazing to here some mericans haven't been brain washed yet
Check out Heather McDonald fracturing her skull after passing out on stage after the booster  https://youtu.be/0ml0UhlQxBk
Georgians are paying attention... you do not need the vaccine!!!
You can have 15 boosters , I don't care .
Real human beings and real patriots!
these mandates need to end now.
also its weird that a state that basically won the election for the democrats is not getting vaxed . does that mean that they are democrat voters not getting vaxed? if so its time to start forcing people to get it because thats not right
Or another way to report this is "Georgia is first in making their own decisions".
is it the white community or minorities that aren't getting the vaccine? we need to get a campaign out there that speaks to them and will get everyone of all races to conform and comply and get the vaccine
I don't believe that Kansas is over 50% "vaccinated". I think you paid lackeys just crank up the fear pron....its either "it's terrible that only 50% of our State is Vaccinated!! GET THE SHOT!!" OR "Wow, at least 50% of our State is vaccinated, so just follow the crowd....GET THE SHOT!!!" If this HIV/baby Fetus/MRNA cocktail was so great and so many people were getting the frankenshot you wouldnt need to be selling this bullshit so hard.
Where are the covid stats? (Not the booster stats...)
Good, keep it that way.   Why are you MSM types so desperate to continue pushing these experimental pharmaceuticals that apparently don’t work as advertised?
Fearmongers
Yee yee huh
Not because black people cant get the vaccine. But because black people don’t want that shit
That cause mfs in Georgia retarded 💀
Georgians are smart
I may consider moving to Georgia. Smart people.
Who cares.
Good for them!
Good
Who cares?
What they don't want to talk about, is how many jabbed people are infected with Covid as compared to unvaxxed, and how many are hospitalized.
Well, c9vid has a 99.995% recovery rate without the vaccine. So the vaccine is pretty much pointless in the first place. But it sure does make billions and billions and billions of dollars.
BFD enough already.
And Georgia is still flourishing. They act like this is the plague and yet the city is functioning like normal. Any abnormalities is forced by the government to comply to non sense
Awesome!! I’m one of em
STILL NOPE my community here in Georgia are actually doing just fine, so nope.... still
I live in georgia and I am vaccinated and have had my booster
this is a positive advertisement for georgia
YT is desperate to keep the pandemic alive.
ZZzzzZzzZzzzZzzzzzzzzZZZ
Watch the latest Project Veritas report on the FDA and vaccines.
We’ll, he’ll we all know 19 is the total IQ of Georgia!
Funeral homes making bank lol
PLEASE leave us alone.
Georgia is probably the healthiest too. Fully vaxxed and boosted folks are finding out the hard way. You can't fight filth with filth. Period.
🤷🏽‍♀️
I’m proud of Georgia
It is no wonder there is so much doubt in the general public if you lok at the available statistics. Georgia has the lowest vaccination rate, howver its case rate follows the average seen across the nation. I believe in vaccinations however the political and commercial hype is hard to swallow.
And your point is….
Total deaths 883576 blue states  538466 red states 345110
And look at that also one of the lowest cases count in nation.  Who leads again? Ah yes. As of February 14, 2022, the state with the highest number of COVID-19 cases was California.
And what of it?
Based Georgia
BREAKING: no one cares
vaccines work. recent study by state of Washington ( Jan 5 '22 ) says non vaccinated 14 time more likely to be infected. and infections can be worse, like death.
👏
Love to see it
Please stay the hell away from Georgia with that poison. We are doing just fine without it
Weorgia
Shove your fucking vaccine into your eye.
Cuz we ain’t sheep
Georgia here I come
Go Georgia! heck yeh. Hold the line
This is because of stupid Brian Kemp. Such an idiot.
It's because the vaccine is useless against omicron.
Good for Georgia!
Great one less trump voter.
Proud of Georgia
That’s cause nobody cares after omnicron turned out to be nothing but some sniffles
No one cares
It sounds like Georgia must have an educated and intelligent community that knows the covid vaccines do more harm than good.
Maybe the people of Georgia are smarter than gave credit for!
Smart people
Good job Georgia! 🥳
I imagine this has a like to dislike ratio something like 1:1000
Sounds like people in Georgia are just smarter than those in other states
Good job Georgia!
... and in a few years half the country will be envious of them. It's a nice feeling knowing you don't have a rushed, experimental mRNA concoction flowing through your veins.
No vaccine!!!
People from Georgia are dumb.
I wouldn't give it to a stray dog or cat
Yep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRH55jnauw&list=RDenRH55jnauw&start_radio=1
People got smart.  Big pharma lied about the vaccine, overpromised the benefit, and minimized the risks.  Hopefully, they will be sued.
Bulldogs, Braves and Anti boosters. We’re #1!!!!!
NC here, no vax, doing fine.  I know many who got vaxxed, only a few got one booster… and all of them say they will NOT take a/another booster.  NC is done with the lies.
Glad to hear that the right-wing extremists are avoiding the vax.  Hope they continue when the next plague comes along.
Besides the fact that your cult audience is the only people that care about covid anymore..uhhh someone has to be last in covid vaccines..who gives a shýt
So you're telling me the biden voters aren't listening to biden
We don't trust you.
Idiots from NYC, Los Angeles and Atlanta preaching to Georgians don't know a damn thing about actual Georgia, haven't even been to real Georgia and don't know the culture at all. There's ZERO chance you're getting them to take it.
Okay and? People that wanted the vaccine got it, and the ones who didn’t, didn’t. Whats wrong with the fact people can make their own choices about their health?
It's because Georgians do not trust the fake government that cheated us out of a real president and are trying to kill us with a vaccine nobody can trust we are not stupid and will not comply with liars .
Exercise, eat correctly -Get Covid, survive Covid, Covid antibodies abound!

Maybe there’s hope for this state after all. The fact that people are smart enough to NOT run out and get this experimental POISON shows that we are not as dumb as the media portrays us to be. And Stacey “lard ass hippo-crite Abrams is the most hated woman in this state!!!
I live in GA, Been Unvaccinated and life is normal as it has ever been.
Good
How do you spell scamdemic? - Answer- vaccine!
Don’t tread on me l. Racists
Just means more natural immunity, which is superior (because its to multiple epitopes, not just one piece of one protein).
BRUHHHH I WANNA CRY, HOW R PEOPLE SO DUMB. I literally like can't fathom how ppl think that the vaccine is bad/harmful. Like I get that you have lead poisoning from your childhood, but damn
The Media is garbage. Like the jab works anyways. I guess we need to keep getting boosters until our immune system does not work! I blame all misinformation on the media. heck they can’t even get the weather right pieces of trash! Anyways go GA and all the wise people who live there who don’t live their lives in fear because of the antics of poor journalism and false propaganda to make certain Americans feel less than because they did not conform to the media’s socialism administered by Brandon and his house of misfits in Washington DC!
J mo
That graph is on par with the number of cases…makes you think doesn’t it?

They didn’t tell you cases were down too. End all mandates and Covid vaccines
I would recommend placing peer-reviewed medical journals into mailboxes across the state.  Perhaps that will sway some minds towards the general direction of the realm of science?  Sorry that your uptake is so low, from Seattle.
The south 😅
Let me guess, it has something to do with a demographic that’s disenfranchised that isn’t being given a fair opportunity to be vaccinated. Or something like that.
Good job Georgia! Freedom > tyranny.
The reason why ivermectin was shunned was because they (pharma and government) were working on a pill and they would lose money
Good for Georgia.
Ok? And?
Booster for what?
the  jab is a bioweapon arrest the medical political and fake news mafias
How about you show the actual infection numbers? Florida and Georgia have some of the lowest numbers, despite the high number of elderly who have moved south for retirement. Trust the science!
Cause we smart lol

Remember when Biden.. Walinsky and Fraudci Fauci all told people you wouldn’t get it or spread it if you got the experimental injections..lol
Gonna give it the Ol’ George “Moops” Constanza: “Oh no.”
Georgia prolly has lowest death rate too
I'm vaccinated and still got sick, why would I boost?
Who cares? Stop talking about something that is pretty much over.
No one ever: Yea we are just following Florida's lead and it's going great!
If you don’t believe the numbers, then take a walk your local cemetery for freshly dug graves.
The gov't thinks we're stupid... When they start getting the national guard to perhaps use force to make us, I have no issues shooting those with the intent of dealing out the gov't's orders.... 5Genocide....  Flagged all day.... We ain't stupid....  Love how they sprinkle the media with blaxks and Hispanics to try to make it seem like they are about looking out for the minorities.... Just so you know Biden, we are the MAJORITY .... Fuxk a vaxx....  The constitution was implemented so as to not abridge freedom of speech/expression, as well as the press....

Wrong. That's not what the Mayo clinic shows.

So what ... No mandates.
Why would anybody take a drug that the drug dealer won't sell you unless granted complete legal immunity from all injuries and death caused by their product?
Strong state
Good, because that governor did the right thing to get rid of these nasty vaccine mandates
New York, New Jersey, Michigan, MA, PA all with higher deaths per million than Georgia.
We are still talking about this? if they were gonna get it they would have gotten it just let it go.
Do not poison yourself with their experiment!!
I’m from Washington state and I’m unjabbed and proud 😍
💜FREEDOM🇺🇸🇨🇦💜
Good.
So if the vax don't work, why keep injecting poisons? Are you stupid? Do you know doctors are not even bright? That's all I have to say. The media needs to playing with the devil too.
Georgians are wising up!
Fraud election, what did you expect from the residents!?
Cause us Georgians are smart people and are using their God given common sense and intuition, I am so proud of my state, not sheeple being led to the slaughter. Georgians  see through all the lies of the 3 letter agencies in charge of the so called science and all the lies of the fed government and there illegal occupation.
Do you know what data dusting is?
Keep going strong pure bloods 🩸
good ...Less sheep here then woketard states like commiefornia
Are we really still talking about vaccines?
Good
Hats off to Georgia! Your election was stolen, but at least you're getting this right.
So there will less zombies in Ga in a few years…..
good!!
Hi 👋 👋 👋 👋  https://youtube.com/shorts/nzZlVhwc3Tg?feature=share
well done Georgia, keep up the good work
Why not talking about Natural Immunity? I know is bad for business!!😂
Heroes all. Embrace the suk libtards
and probably the healthiest
Looks like people are finally waking up..
I’m concerned
Who cares? Stop fearmongering. Maybe you should talk about all the highly vaccinated places with record high cases instead. Also, good job on censoring the comment section. Wouldn't want too many "counter-narrative" ideas to be floating out there, you censorious pieces of human garbage.
damn still havnt got 1st shot and just got back from Mexico
Fewer because vax’d and boosted people are getting it!!
Where’s the Hilary story? She committed treason! Trump was right! FAKE NEWS! I’m headed to Joe Rogan  to get the real story. Bye!
That’s sad
