We Miss Pessolano narrando la Liga en USA
What is the commentators name?
when messi can score from 25 ez but not 12 lol
Diego pesolano te esperamos en spn
Adios vaquero
10:30 last goal for Barcelona 😭😭🐐🐐🤴🤴
Messi last game I found it
Messi last game with Barca 😢
All words should be in all Spanish by no excuses
What happened to Barca???
what’s this commentator’s name?
Lionel the tap in god🤣🤣
insane knuckleball from Soler. Leave it to Messi to miss a pen but absolutely ping a FK off the post.
4:28 why this is our best CB pairing😂
Erró el penal pero después una obra maestra genial genio
Messi really should practice those PKs
What's wrong with Lenglet? Why does he keeps screwing up his job... sheeeeesh!
A Messi que le pongan barrera en los penales para que no falle.
With pique in the back line we will suffer he needs to realized he’s finished and let someone better replace him. As much of a Barca fan I am I have to admit he is no Ramos
arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrco!
free kicks are easier for him than penalties
Og jerseys?
Referees all over the world SUCK!!!! What is that yellow card for Racic??
So easy to be a commentator in Spain. Just when a English commentator has to be at their best, these guys just have to shout "Gooooool!" Every single time. No variation. How boring.
Ter stegen 🔥🔥🔥💪🏽
Koeman out, bring in Marcelino. All goal keepers stay up late studying Messi. That's a fact.
Remember when Europe was pretty much exclusively white? Shouldn't have let in all of those googles and sand googles. Disgusting.
Accept Jesus today before it’s to late, before the 7 years of the great tribulation! You are going to go insane, your not going to want to be here for it, I promise you.  Accept Jesus today before it’s to late, accept Him today.  Believe that he died for your sins was raise from the dead and you will be forgiven of all your sins.  You will be gifted the gift of eternal life in heaven.  Come now before it’s to late.  Brothers and sisters you know the score.  You know what’s coming you know whats happening.  Jesus is coming soon!  He’s coming with great glory and nothing is going to stop him, nothing. I don’t want anybody to perish, I don’t want anybody to be here during His wrath, I don’t want you to go through it.  I am saying this through love, I’m saying this because I love you dearly, I’m not saying this to condemn you, I’m trying to give you hope, grasp it, take hold of it and accept you are a sinner, you know you are!  Accept that you are a sinner and believe that Jesus is the Lord God Almighty, that He became a man by His own will, He became flesh walked on this earth and lived a perfect life fulfilling all the laws so you don’t have to.  He died on the cross after receiving the most heinous horrible punishment and man could face.  He died on the cross, shed his precious blood so that you could be forgiven by the shedding of His blood, the Bible says for without the shedding of blood there is no remission for sin.  His blood has been shed for remission for all sin, Believe it today!  That he was buried and on the third day was raised from the dead, and you will be forgiven you will be granted everlasting life and you will be raptured with the rest of the church, you won’t be left behind.    All those who trust in their own works to keep them safe, well I’m going to be a good person the whole of my life and then I’m going to get into heaven, wrong I’m sorry but it’s wrong, nobody is good, nobody, not one person on this earth is good.  For if you confess the lord Jesus with your mouth you will be saved, for it is written that heart that man believes unto righteousness but with the mouth the confession is made unto salvation.  Confession is saying that you are a sinner that you believe Jesus is the living Son of God, the only Begotten Son of God, the sacrificial lamb of God.  That is what saves you brother and sisters, ladies and gentleman, Catholics, Protestants, whatever religion you are come out of her my children that is what the lord is saying.  Come out of her and come to me.  Repent means change your mind, turn away from the world and come back to him and he will wrap his arm around you, and love you no matter what you do.  He is ready to forgive you, you just have to accept it, the gift is there, just unwrap it and wear it, like a dress or a fresh new new suit.  Wear it, own it, believe and receive.   Get out there and tell the world, even if it’s a 30 second video about Jesus coming back, it doesn’t matter what form or format you use, get out there now and preach the gospel, get out there now and plant as many seeds as you can water as many seeds as you can.  Preach the gospel today with passion now, Gods anger is kindled against Israel, against the world!  He is coming soon!  The Lord bless you, the Lord bless you  And keep, and keep you The Lord make his face to shine and be gracious unto you And be gracious unto you The Lord lift up, the Lord lift up, his countenance on you and give you peace. Shalom
El balón ⚽️ quiere a Messi, lo sigue siempre
pique and bosquets really should consider retiring
I got 4 ads... Remember when it was just one?
The funny is that Messi literally did the same thing against Valencia a few months ago. He missed a penalty and scored instantly with his head when alba got the ball...
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Pura mentira cuando messi falla el penal, dice que los dos equipos invaden el area y no es verdad solo cillisson se adelanta se debio repetir el penal pero como no existe el var a favor del Barca se tragaron el gol en el rebote.
Can you guys get me to 10k 🙃
John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!
Brilliant downs and ups
Messi is always performing at top level.💯🐐
Lenglet y pique que defensas tan malos

Judgement, in turn Acceptance, are fallacies because one is Informed and Functions under a unique Gold Standard birthed amongst varying blends of cultures and religions, not a vacuum 🎈
Goooooaaal
Barca got a penalty, Messi asks the ref can I take a penalty from outside the box
Oo9{and {on ⁹9o9p
La estupidez tiene un nombre: Valencia FC 😑
He can't even score pens why do they call him pessi he scores free kicks like fessi 😎
This was no comeback🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Dude both messi and carlos goals where amazing dang what a good game 👍👍💯
Que buen NARRADOR HERES! I QUE COMENTARISTA DE LUJO TAMBIÉN 👍🏻
Men are happier than ever, And Women Hate it         Iove every moment of it 💀💀💀💀
PR7 is gonna have to clap for Inter Milan  winning the Serie A title when they go to Juve may 15th lol
Messi did not miss, Keeper saved it. there is a differnce.
I feel bad for that defender that got shot to the balls man, rip his future kids man that shit sounded like it hurt like a bitch damnnn
a pk is just a pass to the back of the net.  how does messi miss so many?
Commentary other than english🤮🤮🤮
Misses a penalty and scores a free kick. Typical Messi.
How’s Messi gonna flop the pen that hard then score that banger of a free kick
I hate this announcer
Griezmann is finally showing his true brilliance; De Jong is Barcelona’s future, he shows it every match.
announcer dude loves to roll his Rs like 18,000 times lol. we get it man, you're spanish
Worse Barcelona team I’ve ever seen in the past decade
Que bien que narra este tio 👌
We don't need a Pessi, We need. Messi, the GOAT. Next stop, Atletico Madrid.
Afte that win, the game vs Granada hurts even more.
...the net's so big...it's like missing the broad side of a barn...
people are ignoring how clutch griezman has been at the end of the season
The first two goals were just scrambled goals no skill involved. Just tap ins. The third goal was good.
7:54 pessi at his best. Barcelona barely won. Valencia could have easily won if they didn't blow so many chances. 4:50  Barcelona defense is brutal to say the least.
Barcelona won but Valencia played a better game
Pagando a los árbitros y FIFA y al bar llevando 50 maleta de euro 50 maleta de euro para que Villareal pierda lo vio difícil Barcelona tras empatar 1 a 1 sacaron las 50 maleta de euro se dejaron golear que corruptos vergüenza deberías darle comprando a todo sabe que falta 4 fechas está ardido atlético de Madrid es campeón si señora y señores atlético es campeón
Even though he conceded three goals cillisen played amazing
Lets go
That free kick mannn!!! Messi knew where he was going to place the ball... didn’t even look.....all up in his head.
Esa basura de pique ya no sirve.
Por q vrg hay tantos comentarios en ingles
😂😂😂😂😂
anyone else lose track of how many nearly crucial penalties messi has missed at this point.. i dont care if he saved it with a free kick goal, let Griez or Ter Stegen take your pens if your star player is the GOAT of choking from the spot
Valencia should of won this game. Not scoring second goal before Barca scored gave them chance.
Pique: please, retire from football. How do you think of doing a sweep in the area that didn't even touch the ball, that you could cause a penalty and that to make matters worse, are there people who say you're "good"? I am sure that at this time, you are not.
Este es el equipo que necesitamos
9:58 when Messi stares in to the soul of the gk not gonna get me twice
I think at this point we are not surprised that Messi scores a free kick 😳
@9:30 why didnt the goalie just catch it or punch it wide???
How lucky is Barça? Geezus
Tan yorones los jugadores del barcelona dan berguensa
Can someone tell why we aren't on 2nd place? We're ahead by goal difference...
Keeper off his line. Should have been retaken either way
De jong is insane ... i love that guy :o
Even though pique at 4:10 got blazed by guedes he still hit 31km/hr which is shocking
Lenglet ni umtiti deberian jugar mas
They play so good without Roberto
bro barca messed up in valencias last goal they let him shoot no one pressured the defense needs to work on that
why is Pique still playing in the team idk, he has absolutely no pace and is making a complete joke out of himself in the field. Barca were doing so well without him, he came into the squad and now the defence looks more vulnerable than ever
Why isn't this in English? Where is the english version?
De Jong is barça's best player (besides the 🐐)  Lenglet has been offering so much creativity despite being a CB these past couple games!  Griezmann gotta stay! He's doing great :)
Que buen narrador !
Okay guys, now I need you to not lose to Atletico. This is going to be the first time I’m rooting for you, don’t let me down.
Minuto 8.30... "el arquero Netherlandes"!!!??? 🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦
Can we all appreciate the sprint that busquets did there to get the rebound from the pk!! What a smart player
Thought my video kept freezing but it was just these people talking in Spanish lol
Que pasaría hoy en día con el Barcelona sin Messi???
Carlos soler probably had best goal of the week
11:40 that was dirty asf
valencia wasted so many chances
That Clutch gene came out in Messi
How do you actually have the nerve as a defender to dispute that handball? He clearly reaches out to stop the ball from getting to de Jong.
Partidazo
Pedri is useless as always
Messi went 0 to 100 real quick
Why pique play He is slow incompetent
Instintiva la mano del penal  jajaja admitalo que os equivocaistes
Besides messi FRANKIE IS ON FIREEE THE MAN IS PLAYING HARDER THEN ANYONE RN
Messi doesn't like easy goals that's why he misses penalty kicks and makes free kicks.
Messi don’t score pens😭
10:25 MA-JES-TE-RIAL !!!
Messi, the type of player to miss a penalty for being to easy of a goal and score a free-kick because it’s more of a challenge
De Jong is now a hole player.
Happy to be alive to see Messi
Basquest is the farthest back in the penalty and get their first gangsta
That Soler goal.. wow.
Love it every game is like a finale now 😬
Why is Pedri missing the goal? Does he have a problem in his eyes?
Messi the type of guy to miss penalty then score a free kick
The last two goals of the game was astounding!
u wont find anka sorenson on my sportsmen list
where number one where number one where number one go barca go messi go team go messi go barca go team go
Is it just me, or should riqui puig come in for pedri instead of moriba? ruqui always changes the attitude for the team when he’s on the pitch.
All you pagans speaking English yet no one mentioned the fact that the two goat commentators are missing for this game? Shocking, I am flabbergasted that an international audience could let that run past you like that.
Next season barsa needs a midfield , a center back and crucial striker!
am i bugging but aint messi just cut his beard
Barca is absolutely getting better :)  Marvellous!
Barca d need to be addressed
announcer's 1st goooool was excellent!
Por fin un resumen en español! Mas resúmenes asi por favor
Ronaldo scoring twice and Messi responding a few hours later, just like the old days
The third goal, is perfection, a work of art by the one and only creature that can do such things ....MESSI.
Damn messi just loves choking on pens😂 Wheres first place huh🚬
it’s hard to tell if Barcelona will win bc they start off losing the game but just to come back😅
Messi king!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lol Valencia played better smh but that’s football
Barca got lucky
I know everyone will be talking about Messi buy my gosh what a goal by Soler, absolute belter
The way Soler barely celebrated that amazing goal, that’s true class.
Best goal of all the game Soler, damn what a stunner
Yoooo De Jong and Griezman changed. They’re just kicking ass. Frankie has gotten way better and a lot more confident.
Barceshit is a piece of garbage.
Valencia's keeper was about to kill his team
Both goats scored two goals today to save their teams 🐐 🐐 🔥 🔥
Although they lost, Valencia gave Barca a hard time with those counters. Really exposing their fullbacks high positioning.
Soler's foal....beautiful! Messi's the GOAT
Yo nomas pregunto, esos balones no pesan, xq  los balones donde juego parecen piedra
Where is coutino
Messi el mejor del mundo por siempre 🥇🥇
Can someone tell me why Koeman wasn’t on the sidelines today?
That free kick by Messi was ✨🪄✨
Atletico will beat them next week,,they were so lucky today.
how are we conceding so many goals recently? ugh
I don't understand how Messi has an easier time scoring bangers of free-kicks than penalties
I been saying since Barcelona bought lenglet he's bad and that being nice he's horrible always losing his mark so stupidly
Where's roy hudson?
Props to Valencia bruh beautiful 2nd goal👏they played good🔴🔵🔴🔵
Messi es un cobarde tirando penales....es el jugador mas inflado de la historia
Today Ter Stegen where completely absent minded on both goals.......still we got the win ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️❤️
My dad and I are Barca Fans we put our hands on our forehands when Messi scored the free kick then Soler GOALZO made us surprised we were like What The Foc and then we say that goal was a banger jesus christ what a goal.            😂😂😂
Pedri missing that early chance is unacceptable imo
im a barca fan but that 2nd valencia goal was pure class. best of the day.
Hard , crazy , full of heart  game.
Un gol de Valencia  el jugador arenpujo al portero,  el la penal deberia ser roja  siempre se ve que los comentaristas estan contra barcelona  no solo los albritros.
Valencia should have had 40 before Barca scored their first.
Anyone knows Messi all time penalty conversion rate ?
Solo cr7 puede meter los Penaldo pero Messi mete los tiros directos.
Messi fr the GOAT 🐐🔥
I don’t understand why you guys are posting the Spanish commentary when this is the English version. You guys already have the Spanish version.
Messi misses pens so they won't call him Pessi but still manages to score a brace.
This team is going to give me a heart attack, I swear.
Barsa❤❤❤
ngl we kinda cheap shotted valencias keeper
Honestly came for Ray Hudson's commentary but goddamn one of the Spanish commentators did rival Ray's energy!
FRANKIE HAD AN AMAZING CHANCE AND PASSES IT TO PEDRI
Damn how we failed against Granada
Damn... when Araujo goes hug his teammates, he turns into a whole umbrella. Man is so tall😂😂
Muy mal le esta pegando a los penalties Messi....wow.
Que insoportable como grita ese forajido, y la repetidora que tiene atrás de otro charlatán de primera, que siempre tiene algo que decir, una pena que no se ponga los botines y nos enseñe todo lo que sabe, de paso Messi puede aprender algo.
I hate that imbecilic yelling..... "Goooooooaaaaaaaaaallllllllllll....". It's fun the fist time you hear it, then it just  becomes irritating and childish, and what's even worse, they do it in all of South-America too (as far as I know).
inche Messi,  es el mejor !
Carlos soler que golon un gol divino estos majes no sabes Por que nunca jugaron el futbole
Why isn’t this in enghlish
Messi tiene Suerte ese leva
Messi with that free kick tho 👀🔥what a beast
Sup new vid
Did sergi get a yellow for pulling guedes early on the 1st half
Ter stegan overrated  How can you let that in
Para ganar el campeonato, el Barza, tiene que jugar asi con deseos de ganar.
That 1st penalty was not a penalty by any means
That handball was not a straight red? Reallllyy?
Would appreciate notation of English commentary on your videos
For those yall flaming messi for penalty miss, cillessen was off his line but since messi scored again they played advantage :D
Messi is in a different LEVEL
Pique out
Me da gusto por grizman que esta anotando goles
Valencia playing very well just 4 games in the season with Barca and Real! Very stupid team
Being sports has some of the best commentators
Goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooolllllll this guy comment is something 😂
It seems to me that Messi's freekicks are more likely to go in than his penalties :))
Why do they let messi take penalties? He may be the worst pk taker in history.
Forca barca
Haaland is already > Cristiano
And people still call pedri a top 5 youngster
The goalie came of his line when messi took the penalty.
Good Barca! I dont want you to win la Liga
Don’t understand why messi takes the pens
Barcelona defenders sucks because they can't seems to know their positions but hey 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
intentional hand ball in the box to prevent a goal scoring chance, should've been a straight red.
Messi is the only guy who misses a peno but makes a freekick.
messi is the best, that’s it
About to be 30 league goals which is great for anyone but at 33 very few can do that
Where is Coutihno?
Give me ray Hudson
Penal espantoso dice el narrador, todo el merito es para el portero que lo adivino y lo tapo
The amount of times Valencia missed their chances
Needs a lot of work defensively. First set piece goal was just awful defense.
Valencia could of easily won this if they werent so selfish, could of honestly scored so many tap ins. & also messi should give the penalties to someone else already, its obvious he isnt the right player to be taking them...
pique out man
Pique and Lenglet 💪💪💪 leading by example.
barcelona is such a unit nowadays, they play like 11 motivated people working together to win. HUGE improvements
Nice free kick from Messi☝🏾
I don't care if I can't understand, never play the English commentators again. Ray Hudson is so cringey
Im so proud of greziman he has proven himself
best league in the world
QUE ISQUIERDON DE MESSI! Y VALENCIA NO SE QUEDA ATRAS GOLASOS TAMBIEN
Is time to accept that Messi is not good to take penalty shots!  These kicks must be given to someone else!!!!!
By the skin of their F'N teeth Lionel Messi and Barcelona stay alive in the La Liga title race.
Well one things for sure cr7 is definitely best when it comes to penalties. Not free kicks though.
33 goals conceded in 34 games. That's the problem with Barcelona. 24 by Madrid 22 by Atletico. Lenglet, Umtiti, Pique. Those are the real problem with Barcelona.
If Pedro start to score and Goal keeper stops leaking, we want be sitting on the edge of our seats.
Moriba should not be playing for this team
Griezmann and nessi today pin point perfect
I don't speak a word of Spanish, but I already knew he described Messi's free kick goal as perfect
Aún siguen de pendejos y estupidos desde Koeman y terminando con Koeman.
Even if Messi misses, he scores 😂😂
Unpopular Opinion: Pedri is ass still.
Messi, Grizzi, and De Jong on peak form these past games 🔥💯
Most exciting La Liga season in so many years. Loving it
Messi en el tiro libre mirando directo a ese ángulo donde la puso 10:11
As a real fan, I’m happy to Barcelona vs Atletico. A tie would increase real chances of winning la lugs.
Pique is over He have to leave the club
Soler better be nominated for puskas
Any barca girls from NYC ?
Problem with Barca is that if Griezman and Messi don’t score we will lose
10:13 the commentator says he has a feeling that if the ball goes over the wall it’s going in for barcelona’s 3rd goal.
Messi get the full motivation from cr7 brace huh
Messi scoring open play goals from pens👏👏😂
That's insane by Barcelona but what a second goal. Nothing you can do with that strike
Why that hand ball is not a red card ?
ARRRRRrrriiba
Cillessen was off his line
Messi takes FK like penalties, but I will say he was off his line this time around. Still didn't look confident taking it.
Golazo de soler y Messi wao
Bestial Messi
pique; trojan horse? 4:30
Lol Messi missed a penalty but scored shortly after in both games against Valencia this season in La Liga. Ultimate deja vu
El narrador digo ganamos 😂😂😂😂
He's not leaving Barcelona
Barcelona DE PENA ...gana ....2 penales , bien poco de futbol//////
Someone please rescue Soler from that dumpster fire.
That moment after watching Messi net the free kick, when you thought that was the best goal of the game!
Koeman doing something right fr they still need to improve against big teams but we’re alright for now
What a game
Ahora ya se sabe por que valencia puede ir a segunda..tuvieron la oportunidad y no la aprovecharon
We need a 9 to finish all the created opportunities asap!
where's hudson?
You could tell Cillessen knew his old teammates. Despite the loss, he had a solid game.
Messi is goat as a Real Madrid fan
pedri deserved the whole team to smack him after that miss
❤❤❤❤❤
Shoutout to Griezmann who also had a great performance!
Barcelona won barely, Valencia was the better team today
Messi gonna start taking his pens outside of the box lmfao
Penalty should be retaken
Messi is great and all but when was the last time Barca beat a big team? Juventus back in October and before then in 2019... think about it
Suerte del campeon
El penal ubrierra estado repetido
Game against Atlitic Madrin will decide everything, with a win over them Barsa will be in a better spot than Real since their remaining of the schedule is much easier as well as they don't have to focus on champions league. Just need that 1 W over Atletic M
Barca needs solair
Why the spanish commentary? Why not Ray Hudson?
Nadie dice la FLOR DE KOEMAN 😂
Quien es el commentarista? Es muy bueno y tiene mucha pasion.
Lenglet needs to go
Lmao Barca’s first goal would of been a retake for the pk if messi didn’t score, the guy commuted another hand ball at the line.
Ahí si con esos equipos se agrandan pero que habla pasado con el Paris saint German???????
Can we talk about Ronald’s speed!!!
Does anybody know why this is in Spanish commentary rather than English ?
Gooooooolllllllllllll
Ayo
Without busquets that first goal would not be possible, what a touch
That second goal by Valencia😳😳😳
Pedri what are you doing?
Cillessen is an amazing keeper. His defense was weak!! I could see his frustration.
Again, Barca conceded goals today and they were lucky to have won the game.  If  Valencia has better quality players, they could have scored more with the chances they created.  Barca needs to admit that Barca's defence suck really bad.
Lucky Barcelona and Valencia was better team!
The commentator's not here, but let's say it anyway. "Magisterial from Messi"
Wouldn’t be Barca if they didn’t go down in the beginning, come back to be winning, and let in a late goal to keep us in suspense
La Liga > That Overrated League
if barcelona won against granada they would be first place
Barcelona really needs to improve if they expect a win against ATM
داءما و ابدا التحكبم لانقاذ البرصه 🤣🤣
Messi.Solo necesita subir su poder un poko y los pisa.
No koeman
I only see one 🐐 and he scored 2
Keeper off his line for the penalty
It wasn't an impressive win as it could be if we won against granada
10:30  JUST UNREAL!!!!!!!!!!!
When Messi fans make fun of Ronaldo for too many Penalties while Messi tends to miss them
I hate VAR so much!! Why didn’t they call that a hand ball, VAR Is there for a reason. So dumb.
El Barcelona ha perdido y empatado muchos partidos porque fallan mucho. Vean el 0:32, la que se come PEDRI cerca de área pequeña. Y luego viene el rival y se las clava.
Messi and Ronaldo saved their teams today it’s gonna be a sad time when they retire
If Barcelona got that penalty from that handball, soler would’ve never scored that shot  I’m talking to the people that actually watched the full game..
De Jong is playing incredible, and Greizman has been playing solid for a while now!
post the spanish highlights for barcelona more often
I still can't forgive koeman for losing against granada at home
Idc what anyone says but that should’ve been a red card on the Valencia defender... Most handballs in the penalty box are unintentional and result in yellow cards, this one was clearly intentional. He misses with his head so to stop Barca from scoring, he extended his arm. Later, when Messi took the pen, the goalkeeper was very much beyond the goal line and can’t move until the ball is kicked. That’s not what Cillesen did... Remember when Ter Stegen did the same thing? The opposing team where rewarded another pen. Still won🤷‍♂️
Cuanto le abran pagado al Valencia para q pediera🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
Barca needs Donnu ASAP
Ronaldo and Messi with the brace this weekend 👏
*el próximo partido Barca VS Atletico sería de infarto*
Por que los comentarios son en Ingles??
Mas suerte que esa no se puede preguntar...
Este argentino mala leche se quería morir con los goles de Messi 🤪😂 y el otro ecuatoriano que cree que el fútbol es para matemáticos 🤷‍♂️😂💙❤⚽️ que viva el fútbol
Game of the Season
Honestly without messi koemans tactics would be shit. Thank God for bringing an alien to our team 😭🙏
legends would remember paulista and costa's fights during london derbys
Barca got gem like De Jong
I'm no ref but wasn't that a foul on ter Stegen during the first Valencia goal? it look like #2 was straight up obstructing his path n knocked him down
My day isn't going well....i want Barcelona to draw 😌😌😌
Goat 🐐
🔴🔵
Messi vs valencia😂
the Messi freekick trajectory breaths improbability for any goalie to save. Stunning talent!
How was that handball not immediately a red card?
seriously pique and busquests need to go to china or mls they re not fit to play at barca anymore. i hope barca can find good fits for there positions soon
Sorry, did Basa change the coach? I missed that?
Good we won
Honestly, I feel like we're still a mid-table team. We can beat average teams all we want and boast our confidence but every time we face a top-tier team we get shit on. This was and should be an excepted win. Good luck to koeman vs atletico. That'll show how average of a coach he is.
La defensa Barcelona
Pique has done his time
Why tf yall still clowning Messi EVEN IF HE SCORED 2 GOALS FFS. OKAY he misse the penalty, but YALL IGNORING THE 2 GOALS AND A FREEKICK
De Jong is unbelievable, one of the best players out there
The Goat’s saving their teams today. It’s a good day for football
Nothing is more satisfying than seeing a Messi freekick swerve into the post🤤
still cant fathom how Valencias first goal stood but thats football huh
Soy yo o me equivoco, soy fanatico del Barca pero ya el tiempo de Piqué acabó en este equipo. Retírese señor con la frente en alto, pero ya usted no está al nivel que el Barcelona exige..., un aplauso por tu aporte y tu historia pero ya es suficiente
I was expecting Ray Hudson!
I love this commentator
Simple Messi
This commentator is mad annoying
Búsquets is soooo slow
Everyone talking about the comeback, but no one talking about Soler's goal? Knuckleball screamer into the top corner, damn near took the roof off the net.
Seems like Barca defense always try to compete with their attack.  Their attack scored 3 goals, their defense conceded 2 goals.
Suarez vs messi
Messi always missing penalties just get him off them, he’s not clutch
Messi goat free kick
Barcelona always relax when they're leading. Thank God the match ended else it would have been a draw in 10 more minutes.
Alguien que aga un comentario en español digo si los narradores son latinos 😜
Messi should just stop taking penalties
Vamos vamos Barcelona vamos vamos a ganar que está banda que ganemos
We need to tighten up on those defensive mistakes
I know Ronaldo has scored more goals, and Messi has more Balon D'ors. But we all know that both of them are the goat.  If you are not counting Brainwaite  But seriously, you can't compare the two. They are both entirely different players. Ronaldo= 🐐 Messi=🐐
By winning their remaining 4 games, including against Atletico, Barca actually helps Real win La Liga.
Messi how do you wanna score 🤔 Penalty =nope 🙅‍♂️ Free kick = yeap😎🤙
Who needs a coach?
Wat a goal by carlos soler 👏
Koeman looked a bit different today
Que mal tiró el penalti Messi. Sigo siendo tu fan, pero vamos tío
Man Pedri could’ve passed it to messi would’ve been a phenomenal team goal but this game got me so scared happy to get the 3 points hope we can take away atleticos next
Where the haters at ?🤡🤡🤣😂😂😂
Toxic Barca fans after Valencia scoring a goal : I knew we would bottle it. This team has no energy. these players are trash. Same toxic Barca fans after comeback : let’s go I knew we could do this I love this team so much.
look like messi miss neymar he wants to slow down n rest so neymar can cover the left side this was good plan neymar fits this team n barce style  who ever made the deal send neymar wanna messi work over time alone n hate messi n barce
No mames, que golazos
cr7 just call for Messi
A win is a win I guess but Barcelona play like shit
Honestly Lenglet isnt that good man. You can tell even messi doesnt really like him.
Barsa son cagones fanfarronea  x eso no van hacer campeones
I came for Ray Hudson
Bro you could tell Messi really wanted to score that free kick after missing penalty
By definition, there can only be 1 🐐 = Messi
I need Ray and phil here pls BeinSport
That second Valencia goal is a stunner
Cillessen better than Neto tbh
Me and my friend Messi are comeback kings
2 lucky goals lolz and Valencia the shitters couldn’t stop the first goal for them and etc so dumb
Messi free kick goals this season: 3 Ronaldo free kick goals at Juve: 1
Wait wheres Koeman?
Now if we beat Atletico we can still win the league!
Barca were so lucky today man
Messi misses the pen but still scores, and then scores a free kick. What a relief
Messi scores free kick: Carlos Soler: I can show you something better
Messi back probably hurt rn
La PUlga and La Petit Prince form a ecstatic duo.
Damn he missed a pen but made the freekick🐐🐐🐐
Prediction I might be biased  Real 2-0 Sevilla Bacerlona 1-2 atletico
Bald koeman 😂
Pedri needs to get better at shooting...
Ray Hudson's obsession with the Riqui Puig is officially creepy. Week after week, it's "This is the perfect situation for Puig, who never fails to impress."  It's to the point where Hudson is now criticizing every touch by 18-yr-old Ilaix Moriba. "Riqui wouldn't have done that!" Flat-out weird.
Where’s ray Hudson 😡
AYYYY FARÇA BARÇA 💙❤️💙❤️💪🏿💪🏿
messi. what a 🐐.
I got like 10 heart attacks watching this games. Man barca really loves come back lol
Messi can miss a penalty but can make a free kick... goat things
Ade Tovar and odegaard 21 watching this: 😢🤡
3 goals in 12 minutes. Barcelona’s comebacks are incredible
Where is Ray Hudson :(( We misss you RAYYYY!!!!!
In coming Ronaldo fan boys
I actually think griezmann should of been the man of the match he did excellent. But not mad that Messi did.
Why is Messi so good
Messi is too GOATED 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🤩🤩🤩🤩
Isn’t that a foul on Ter Stegen?
Carlos soler what a player👍
Messi : Penalty = NO! OpenPlay = YES! Penalty = NO! Freekick = YESSS!!!
Sergi Roberto Man of the Match
when will goatwaite play
wheres the english commentary breh i wanted to hear that so badly
Where’s ray hadson
bro how does Messi miss that pen then score that free kick😂😂🐐
this highlights are fast asf 😳
A lot of emotions in this game it was tough seeing how much Barcelona were suffering in this game but Barcelona did it! Lionel Messi the Greatest of All Time scored 2 goals one of them seconds after missing the penalty and the other one was a Free Kick. Never lose faith Barcelona fans La Liga will be Won by Barcelona this season let's always be positive! YO SOY CULE! 🥁🥁🥁🥁 Plus Antoine Griezmann with a goal and the celebration 😂 Great! Barcelona fan always!
Griezmann and Messi are on fire but that defense is so shaky.
Puig could have done better than Ilax
expecting ray hudson commentary:(
Barcelona deserves to win LaLiga. They were supposed to beat Grananda comfortably but my finished club Real Madrid paid the ref to help Granada beat them, my club robbed Osasuna yesterday and also paid Elche to purposely miss a pen against Atletico Madrid. We are UEFAdrid for a reason
I hope your watching Madrid
Messi the GOAT!
VAR is useless
Barcelona win laliga this season anyone barcelona fan
Sevilla knows what to do next 🙏
Incoming Ade tovar
Messi is the goat no question
is he better than lewandowski right now?
I wonder how Ray Hudson reacted to that Messi free kick goal
Messi is too good
I’m in a discord with Madrid and Barca fans and they were spamming about “pessi” and when he scored two goals they went 🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐
what a day for messi and ronaldo, both with important braces. goats 🐐.
Here before the trolls come in.
YOO
Nice
dont ever give me the "messi can't perform when his team needs him to"
Messi missed a penalty to stop online abuse he can’t be called pessi tonight 🐐
I still don't know how Pedri missed those chances.
Ronaldo had 30 free kicks goals in 2011 while Messi had 4. Today he tied him for 56 fk goals. Absolutely nuts. With 200 games less.
Karma to the haters
You can never doubt Barcelona 😢
bro messi and his free kicks are the best, tell me a better live story
Holy that was close
Messi once again shows why he's the goat
Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi scored two goals today there still showing their best 🐐
Ronaldo and Messi the comeback kings today
The fact that im scoring and assisting more than all of real Madrids attack(besides benzema)
Messi the goat cheaters never win Valencia first goal was a foul and we should have had a 2nd penalty for handball
Messi when he's in the mood is nothing short of amazing! 👏🔥
Barca almost bottled this one lmfao
Finally Spanish Commentary
