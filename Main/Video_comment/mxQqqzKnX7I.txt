AND I BRING IT. YOU SEE HOW UNNATURAL IT IS.
3quency are the Best
❤️🔥🔥🔥
I just love her❤❤she’s so amazing ❤
2:34
Doja did her thang
3quency doing the i didnt sell my soul version
I love how Ciara dance now like me I be like I use to be turning up but now I got daughters that be hawking me gotta keep it cute
Was Ice Spice mad that she wasn’t performing at that moment? 😂😂😂
Ay Jennifer lopez, eso de los besos, ya está pasado de moda....ejejejeje Madonna y Britney dejaron el altar muy alto, y jamás serás grande de la generación del pop. Eres muy buena bailarina pero jamás sera una reina
This performance was very tame compared to her VMA performance… I hate online fans because she only toned it down because of the hate she got for her VMA performance with people saying she was “doing too much” and she needed to be “more appropriate for kids” and other bs.
Chloe ❤❤❤❤
Ovo muzika je hao svidja mi se tako da znas jer je super 20 ocena
I feel like these Chloe’s AMA performance started with so much promise, but it didn’t carry that same energy throughout. The intro was powerful honestly too good for what followed. After she came down from that elevated height, the energy dipped instead of building up.  If she was going to end on a more relaxed “chill and vibe” note, then the intro should have matched that mood. Otherwise, it feels like a shift from serious and commanding to just laid-back, which took away some of the momentum.  For me, Chloe’s best live performances as a solo act so far remain:  Feeling Good (Uncut)  MTV VMA performance  BET performance   Those ones carried consistency and fire all through. 🔥🔥🔥
About time we saw real talent on the stage...
Her breath control!? Wtffff
3Quency did it better
Rewatching, I love that performance so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I like 3quency performance more 😁
She's Beyonce replacement
Who's here after watching 3quency performance?🙌
Chlöe Congratulations on all your ventures Blessings from myself 2 U & Your Manager
I love you girl ❤❤❤
Beyonce
YEAH ACTUALLY. I`D BE GIVEN THE CROWNS BACK. THEN GAVE AND GO. SONS IS HORSESHOE CRABS ACTUALLY. BIG PEOPLE IS KI11ER WHALE AND MONSOON. ANNOINTED FOR LONG LIFE. FATHER BE ROACH. ANOTHER ANNOINTED ENTITY. BROTHER THEN. WHAT BE BROTHER. BROTHER BE LADY BUGS. ABSOLUTELY TERRYFYING. I WOULD NOT.
I remember watching this live on tv. great work🔥🔥🔥🔥
I feel like Beyoncé holds her back on purpose!!!  This song and so many of her others prove she could be the next Beyoncé! Younger and more talented! Beyonce sweating 🥵
i'm still trying to figure out the lyrics to the dance break part!
Wow so skinny but not
🍎🥭🥭🍎🍎🥭🍎🥭🍎🥭🥭🍎🥭🍎🥭🍎🥭🍎🍎🥭
YESSSS!!!! 🔥🔥
Love the performance but I absolutely hate when performers do church/pure like themes then sing about sin, she came down to that stage like the angel of ratchedness
When I liked Bey .. this was her best performance in my opinion this and who runs the world live
https://youtube.com/shorts/Jv6tOH0fe1U?si=XQnMvo1QtY5VG5Ep
I don't see Beyoncé. I see Chloe trying to prove a point. She doesn't realise it's too distracting though.
I am sure she syed the girl from the Bronx!  She should have just walked away!
Love Chloe this was the best performance
So talented!!!! I can listen to take it thereeee all day
Keep Flossing Chlo, keep Saucin’ Chlo, we see you and we Know you will and can keep up the Flo!❤ Performance never disappoints little niece👍🏾
Ouuuuu Chloe🔥🔥🔥
Everything she does is Beyonce old dances and movements.
I just realized that the only time someone is trending is when they do things that make people talk about them
What An Amazing Performance 🔥✨🌟✨
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hands down the best. The stepping scene did it for me. Cemented this as 100% Fresh. 💯
❤️🔥
Ateeeeeee ❤❤
Chloe is so underrated!! This song and performance? 👌👌
The Best Performance From The 2021 American Music Awards Too From Chloe Bailey Too ❤😊❤😊❤😅🎉

I had the audio cassette in the year 2000. I cried every time I listened to it 😭❤.
Her voice is amazing!
1:00 cupcake versions
I thought CHLOE will be the next big thing she totally promote this song but sad the album FAILED.... Even the SECOND album still a failure!!!!!
My mind screamed "Beyoncé!!" Right when it started!!
😍❤️‍🔥
Now wait what is Gaga doing in this 😂😂 I love it tho
This is one of the best performance ive ever watched, i keep coming back.. whatever she tapped into was def authentic.
She don't look happy in this performance
One thing for certain she is absolutely NOT lip singing. 😍🥰  I love this lady!
Came back to this after seeing a guy on IG create a choreo for it…. bcuz she really snapped tf out
This plus the vmas really shifted something I'm so sorry she didn't get more support
adele hazé 14 agnos cantava como hoy y era ermosa y hoy no lo es mas si tiene otro luk pero lo que cuenta siemdo cantanté es como canta y no cuanto miden ni pesan no es un concurso a top modfelos y muchos son descriminados por eso y que buscan vellas canciones o top modelos
Amazing breath control fr
Looking at this in 2024 really shows how much you’ve grown as a solo artist!!!
Goodd
God loves repent 😊
Young black women should have a baby and she still look good that's a real black woman's body with no filters enjoy your black body from the ancestors
Well I love her that's her real body, that's her real body black women
Shes got a lil Janet in het
Wow
she sang tf fuck outta this song
I like to buy Chloe it was her real body, it was a real black woman's body when she was born with
Whenever I hear her and her sister I get the chilllssssss
Showed OUT like a real GawgaGUH!!! ❣️💅🏿#PEACHEZ🍑
my lord this woman's talent is out of this world
Não consegue nem andar e cantar ao mesmo tempo
What made me like her at 63 years old, it was actually her body that she was born with
This is a real performance, movement covering your entire set. Bomb visuals and Intro and keeping up that choreography 🤌🏾🔥👑
I'm 63 years old, she's not even in my category I'm at a category with Al Green and Marvin Gaye, I like about her that's her body she was born with that body come through generations she can pay for her ass or titties and that's all I can about her, if you find any white woman that look like that she paid for it trust me
Why I love about this video all those women it was their real bodies
I like about her it's her real body it's her real body I'm going to say it again and it's a real body she's born with from grandmama her mom that's a real body
Why I like about this video it was a real body
The dance break is EVERYTHING
she was trying to summon sasha fierce but failed 0:33
Choles a baddie and i want to like her as an artist. But i cant. She such a damn PLANT. and its crazy. Her music dont really hit. Shes okay as a performer especially if you love that cake. But her image aint it.
Still Sep 2024.    Real Thickness, Real Brains, Real Voice..... Real Talent
Ohh she bad bad❤❤❤❤❤
OMG ❤❤❤❤
Killed it!!!!!!
mother
Ok
Very magnifico
She look just like halle 😂👏👌
BEYONCE BOOTCAMP
Glossy floss
This is real ass, what day was born with no plastic
What made everybody trap not to clean twin she killed it, I'm not gay I'm 63 years old I watch her grow up, I was shot
Chloe in beast mode. I don't know why her manager didn't promote her album because it was banging songs and videos.

How is she able to sing and dance like that  without being out of breathe ,she's amazing . Go girl 😭😫
For Anybody trying to learn the chant She does during the Choreography at the end its " He can’t live without me because my ass is fat. I don’t need your shit, and I don’t need your Cash App. Have mercy. Work it on the left, then work it to the right. Work, work—all this ass up in my jeans—That you can’t get up in between. Tryna get a piece of me? Imma teach you a couple of things. Work."
Who here in 2024 august😂❤️
Omg 😮she is so freaking sexy 😮
This made me look at her catalog because I already knew she could sing…. However that stage presence?!?!! 💯
Come oooooooon! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🔥
So mad we cant find the original in the pink
Vocally no, visually yes!
Hai
I really hope she does other genre's and collabs
2:31 ❤❤
I love her performances ❤
It's 2024 and I'm still gagged😭
Her breath control is ridiculous,to sing and dance and still sound amazing. Her performances are always captivating🙌🏽💕💕💕
Lord have mercy🫠
1:15-1:21❤❤❤
The way Coco was SHOOK! 😆
Sasha Fierce in the house 💅🏽
That’s the new Beyonce
Who y’all think is better in the industry as an artist for females. Victoria Monet, Beyoncé, etc. All them doing they thing honestly that all I have to say.
❤❤❤
I wish they didn’t take down her other performance in the pink suit- THAT ONE WAS ITTTTT. The choreo was everything
Body ❤
When she said take it THERERRRR❤
Okay but 2:33😍😍😍😍 note was perfection
🔥🔥🔥🔥
2:42 the best part
2:31 - 3:16
Bet she didn’t know that she would be the little mermaid Ariel and 2023
Oh Lord Chloe 😍😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Unfortunately Beyonce is her manager/producer ? That's a sure way 2 keep talent in its place !
I was wondering why her performance mercy was deleted . That one was so amazing
Her voice control is craaaaazzzzy!!!!
I'm now officially a stan❤🎉
Did anyone noticed theres noo video of first performance of lord mercy in pink outfit? She killed the dance there it's gone for some reason
Definitely did that ❤❤❤❤🙌👏👏👏👏
Adina Howard ok girrrl that’s was So Dope❤❤❤

We just straight out encouraging pornography now. Piece of shit society, poisoned the whole fkn earth with this disgusting behaviour.
🌏🌎🌍🌏🌎🌍🌏🌎🌍🌏🌎🌍🌏🌎🌍🌏🌎🌍🌏🌎🌍🌏🌎🌍🌏🌎🌍🌏🌎🌍
She was born in the wrong era. If she came out in the early 2002's, people would be debating chloe vs Beyonce. But then again, beyonce would probably get her father and Jayz to blackball Chloe. Crazy times i tell you
The dance break at 2:41 is my favorite to come back to
Ma ma u came to EAT OMG!!!!!!!🩵🩷
2:38
She’s on beyonce level, but beyonce wont help to replace her lollllllll
SHE ATE THIS TF UP
❤❤
Chloe is amazing legit might go straight for her lol ❤❤ 2024
2:37 Is HER moment!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
It’s weird how these celebs are mocking Christianity and are rewarded for doing so but let them try to mock Muslims.
Is it crazy to think that Beyonce  slowed her career down because she thought she could surpass her in music one day .. I mean Micheal at one point was the king of pop Beyonce is known as the queen for whatever reason but he was that nigga back then and went bankrupt and was known to be a weirdo when he died .
I can't wait until she blooms into a dynamic live performer. She's better but I'm waiting patiently for her to find her and flourish.
❤❤
ling?
😮 if you don't know how to make use of your massive light show just show outer space... that would have been more visual appealing 😮
She sounded so stable throughout her entire performance even though she was jumping and everything! Big applaud on that. My jaw was to the floor the entire time I was in awe.  Also jealous she got to perform in front of BTS
Chloe will be the next  Beyonce in due time?
YOOO, Stop trynna be Queen Bey…
this is amazing
Im sorry...Chloe's thickness /sexuality is always more on display than her actual vocals....... look forward to actually hearing her sing
.
Booty’s not that big but those thighs are huge. Lord have mercy.
What happened to your 2021 VMA performance?
Trevor Jackson is kayvon
So she starts off as an angel then she goes down to hell...ok...got it.  I do like Chloe!!! The industry is just a trip.
You did some stuff on Instagram that was unnecessary
Trevor Jackson sorry for acting fast
Vai miúda 🥰
Good job chloe ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Next beyonce❤
❤
Love this song
Wowwwwww
😊sexy
She killed that!!!
😍😍😍😍😍👏👏👏👏👍
I love how ur vocals sound live ❤ (a few artists I used to listen had pretty bad live vocals and made it hard to listen to them tbh)
У нее такой шикарный стабильный голос, восторг 👍🏻
You did gurl 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
She ate
This lady is the replacement of Beyonce ❤❤❤🇿🇦🇿🇦
Chloe knows how to kill it with only one stare amazing she dances way much better than Ashanti and Shakira and Beyoncé and Tamar Braxton
Look at her face at the end, she knew she ate that up!!!!!
One of her BEST PERFORMANCES🔥
my child!!!love her oh my Gosh
Neraka incess ✍️
Neraka incess ✍️
Neraka incess ✍️

Oh she got loose
Meanwhile, the Hyung line of Bangtan nearly stood up out of their seats 😂
I will never understand why people hate on Chloe. She is beyond talented...the next generation Beyonce in her own right ❤
Kau riak. Hati hati ko pilih teman.?!?!hahhaha. Kau riak. Hati hati ko pilih teman.?!?!hahahah. Kau riak. Hati hati ko pilih teman.?!?!hahahaha.
At Chloe what do you do with your backup dancers costumes when the performance is over do you put them up for auction do you put them in storage what do you do with your ladies who are your beautiful dancers clothing and it's just a random thought that occurred
2:36 The choreography is AMAZING and the girls singing sent chills down my spine. She’s definitely a star!
She Ate💯💯
O corpo dela é tao lindo
🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿
What a song and what a performance. So much talent in one person.
That was superb awesome 💯
All this assets in my jeans 💀
Chloe Bailey is a true inspiration.Go Chloe 🔥
She is incredible! She is better to do solo then duet. Other one I can stand at all.
Princess bey ❤
So talented ❤
Chloe we love your mercy❤
❤ when your heart is on 🔥🔥🔥🔥
SHE WOULD LOOK BETTER IN CLOTHES EVERYONE DONT LOOK RIGHT IN A ONESEY,,,,,,,,,IF U TOO HEAVY
The remix went crazy 😂❤
This performance was terrible, mic was low and dance moves didn’t match the song
Outstanding Performance  Chloe way much better than Beyoncé & Nicki Minaj high speed Chloe high speed I definitely love your performance
*The inro is so beautiful literally live for it.!*
I heard someone sing this on tic toc and had to find the full song
Just another copy of Beyoncé 😂😂😂😂 Lack a lot of originality
chloe is so underated she did a beyonce performance and danced? this girl needs a grammy!
😍
*WHY DID THE MTV HAVE MERCY PERFORMANCE GET DELETED OFF OF MTV YOUTUBE CHANNEL WHEN SHE WAS WEARING ALL PINK?* 🤔
I don’t how many times I come back to watch this performance! It’s literally my top 3 of hers! 😍😍😍
She sounds so much like Beyonce
WOW!!
She Ate and did not leave a crumb for the girls. 😂
out of bref lol
dumbass beginning
Girl! YOU BETTA STEP! yesssss hun!
#YokGang
ate
Chloe's proformance is really amazing.
The red led lights behind her that made her hair looked red makes her ariel duplicate, so cute
Chloe > Normani
She came to play and the tears were just the icing on the cake for me. Her vulnerability and power at the same time. Vocals....check. Choreography.....check. Stage presence....check. Shes more than ready and I bet Beyonce was so proud watching this.
🔥 🔥 🔥
Holy mf shit!!!! That was INCREDIBLE!!!
Honestly she’s one of the best!! She deserves so much more recognition. ❤
That was gross😢
Beyonce Watching : That's my girl!
She atee this performance up I love her so much the Energy the emotional every thing about this performance atee❤❤
The best ever!
Chloe is  Actual Talent ❤
I want legs like her 😢😭😭😭
This is so awesome
She so young beautiful and talented. Her voice speaks for itself, I don't think she has to sexualize herself so much to the audience attention.
THE LIVE VOCALS ARE INSANE OMGGG
idk why people choose to forget that chloe is a PERFORMER right to her core!!
Can anyone tell me what the girls are chanting as they stomp? It’s so empowering lol.
She killed it 💯❤️💯
Still can’t believe BTS was right in front watching this beauty and awesomeness 🥺
2:42
2:43
yo the backup dancers tho. 🔥🔥🔥
Reinonaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
♥♥♥
Commanding a stage that big is the LITMUS. Passed!
You can really see that Beyoncé’s mentorship. She’s so talented omggggg
Beyonce should be scared! Chloe can definitely take her place if Chloe plays it smart and leave that contract with her. Asap
Her voice is far superior to the sexual nature of the performance.  All of that is so unnecessary.  Too good of a singer for that.
Still Cringe to me
Chloe Bailey Cancer ♋ 🦀  GANG 💪 💪 💪
OK I'm sorry to burst yall bubble but beyonce is a EXTREME vocalist so there is NO WAY she can sing better than her. I have to admit she can dance but Beyonce is also a professional dancer :)
0:48
Why can’t I find the original where she’s performing in the pink? It was so iconic
She is the next big thing!talent..image...presence
🔥🔥🔥
I neeeeeeed thé ending part ina song “HE CANT LIVE WITHOUT ME CUZ MY ASS FAT”
CHOLE!!🧡💚💜💛💙❤️.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
I still hate how she hasn’t taken off the way she should.
Wait I’m on YouTube after I went to google to find the first performance but this one is on here that’s so weird. Maybe that first one revealed too much
She is literally the next Beyoncé sooooooo talented ❤❤❤❤
What is this crap
I cant find her vma performace vid???
Anyone here from the album teaser?
I’m tryna learn the choreography at the end 😭🔥
Little mermaid's sister was showing BTS of all new world
She has no competition what’s!!! She’s just going strong she’s hungry for this and honestly she reminds me of Beyonce even though she’s not her but she is just as Talented!!
Can't believe I got to know today, when I asked my wife why she named our baby Chloe ❤️
So ready for her tour 😍💕
She just massacred slaughtered assinated that performance but I expected nothing less cause she is a gifted artist and so young
HER BEST PERFORMANCE
AMAZING!!!.  She actually sang the song live and danced her ass off. Much respect. She did the damn thing.
Anybody got a audio version of this?
She has the talent the look 😍. She just needs the sound to match herself.
COME ON CHLOEEEE
WHERE IS THE MTV PERFORMANCE CHLOE PLEASE
Bodiiieeeddddd❤

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💯
locuraaaaaaaaaaa
Somebody lit a fire under her ass before she went out
Performance would've been amazing if she wore something else. Just tired of black women always oversexualizing themselves.
2:40 eu amo tanto essa parte aaaa 💖
EPIC 🥶
Girl can SANG
All I saw was Beyonce Vibes
Chloe is so beautiful, I hope she never have  any cosmetic surgery are body surgery. Her and her sister is so beautiful the way they are.
Honey the woman can dance!!
I want her with a headset mic. So she can really kill her moves 10x more, the vocals are ON POINT. imagine being free from holding the mic🔥🔥🔥
Chloe that dance break at the end was flawless !!! I’m very impressed !!!

This is different caliber!

Freaking hot performance 🔥🔥🔥♥️♥️♥️
Perfect!
I like her slot. At first I didn't. But I'm a fan. She could sing her ass off and dance. I respect her. She's like a little Beyonce. I'm proud of her and her sister
She is a sexy R&B Female artist of all time
Why are the dancers wearing masks to perform that’s so stupid?!
I love it friend
Fucking love this young Queen. I look at you and your sister and know the future of entertainment in safe hands 💯💃✨❣️💁🏽‍♀️💯✨💃❣️

Chloe’ KILLED IT BABY 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Does anyone know what they’re saying in the chant?
🤙👊
Thickness laws haf mercy!

Say what you want about Miss Chloe, talk ur shit and run ur mouth. This girl is a STAR. She's gonna be around for a long time and she's not going anywhere.
Am I the only notice the vma performance gone
😍
Period (done) end the show! It's over! It's a wrap! And good night folks ! Lmao you ain't got to go home buuuuuuuuuhhh🤪
A collabo with Normani will be bomb😊😊
She literally had NO MERCY! The performance always lives up to the song! SHE LEFT THE CROWD SPEECHLESS! SHE MURDERED EVERYONE AND LEFT NO WITNESSES!
Bruh u can literally tell tat she has sold her sold to the demonic!! The witch vibe bruh can't y'll see?
Dayum, this girl is on fire!!
She Killed that Performance 😈😈😈
Why don’t I realize how good she is
Dayummmm!!!!! 😍😍
Her voice is so angelic Omg
killllllleeeedddd IT!!!!!
Her welcoming performance.
The fact that she performs this phenomenally in what could be considered the infancy of her career is astouding. She should be taking the world by storm right now.
That was such a big SLAY !!!!!!
Beyonce knew what time it was gonna be when Chloé & Hailey hit the scene
And visuals too
0:52   2:33
Chloe and BTS= perfection
Ya entiendo😳 por qué el Hoseok me fue infiel
God that intro is SO ICONIC!
amazing performance, but terrible camera work! Chloe deserved better
I wish she’d actually sing the all words out, so it doesn’t sound so spotty; it would have made the performance better
I’m so glad she rocks natural hair styles 👍
Beautiful song beautiful wonderful fabulous fantastic wonderful voice Chlòe congratulations you are beautiful Chlòe ❤
She killed it
Black people are so easily entertained this girl is a real singer, and we have limited her talented to just shaking ass. Her and her sister together was something different. And the world couldn’t wait to tear them apart.
2:43 This!
Honeyyyyy!!! I just love the whole performance vs video. You never get the same thing
Why does it sound and look scary
We found our new Supreme.
She was just fabulous! Love her!
What a performance 🎭 she’s amazing 🥲
❤
No no no this is not my cup of coffee. Not good than official video.
The satanic symbolism is so obvious, anyone that praises this is out of their mind.
Yea boo
what a stargazing performance from my all time crush😍😍😂
Sis is NOT to be played with! Gather y’all coins cuz it’s her ERA!
2:11 é Lula 2022
🔥🔥💕❤️‍🔥
I just dont see it, a Beyonce knock off that really has no stage presence and definitely has no vocal range live...that was all pre recorded like all of her performances have been....just have to keep it 100...
she is not singing,,,she is lip syncing  I have never heard her sing live, its obvious she is singing over a pre recorded track. You guys cant be that grey and if you are dont admit it!!LMAO
Those pink swimsuits are Everything! And they practiced COVID safety guidelines 😷😉.
I just know bts happy
❤️🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽
2:42 "You can't live without me because my ass so... I don't to need to. I don't need to ask ya. From the left left from the right work work all this ass up in my jeans you can't get up in between tryna get a piece of me imma teach you a couple things work!"
She aint a lazy artist  very entertaining
Maaaaannnn she is ALWAYS on point!!!!!
I gasped jaw drop I liked your preform ace imagined dancing it with you in my jeans your kool and awwwww HERMOSA AKA GORGEOUS 💜1️⃣💜1️⃣🌹❌⭕️❌⭕️🇺🇸🌸💫🌸💫🌸🌸🌸💫🌸💫🌸💫😇
Up*
She ate all the girls ip
Her outfit tho she is FIRE
GIRL YES!! 👏🏾🙌🏾
She ate.
Ella es una mujer poderosa, waaaah que presencia escénica tiene está mujer. She is amazing
Could she be coming  right behind  Queen Bey???
When you're the Protege of Beyonce of course you'll be talented and kill every show 🤗 🤗. Chloe and Normani are so UnderRated that it's Ridiculous. STAY SAFE EVERYONE. GOD BLESS.
Beyoncé done taught her some thangs!!
Beyoncé got her cold as hell! She fire 🔥
Extraordinary experience. YYOU GO GIRL,ITS YOUR TIME....
I like this nahh she did good🔥🔥
Looking very ritualistic at the beginning but I definitely enjoy the dance breaks
BEYONCE, is proud. protege fr.

Clhoe e uma rainha
She immediately bodied without no fear you can see the sadness on her face and that look means You deserve what you got to those haters yessssss chloe Slay Queen and the Backup dancers 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
ATE & ATE
Shame the only way chicks can sell a song these days if they slap their 🐈 on the floor. Smh
Pure talent
how many Beyoncé‘s do you need we need
What a tremendous performance she is amazing so beautiful too such incrediblel artistry with music is absolutely magical⭐🌈🌅💒🍻🍷
Nice
The fact the she is compared to queen b in a good way say alot but this performance is showing me chole not Beyonce and I love it
This young lady is extremely talented  but I have to call it like I see it. This visual representation is extremely sacrilegious. It's making a mockery of the church. People open your eyes, stop being sheep cause you will surely be led to the slaughter and not even see it coming. Be very careful of what you let Penatrate your souls.
It’s giving star fire from teen titans
Now THIS is an “Have Mercy” performance! Keep going, sis!
Amazing
Just wanna  say watching  all  things  chole  and  happy  I found  this goodie ☺
💣🔥
She understood the assignment!!!!!!
WE need more of Chloe
Lip syncing
This girl is amazing
Who’s here after her *AMAZING* BET performance?!
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🔥😘
BTS:👁🫦👁
A satanic proformance, but it's a good song.
She did amazing
Keep going
https://youtu.be/db-koRJbW0Y  Watch this summer time jam!
She did that sh!t 🥰❤️
Chloe do everting, she can sing, rap and dance sooo beautiful.
The next Beyoncé
this one is waaaaaay better than the VMA’s one like wow, this is what we except from a performer, creativity like for this step part ? SO GREEEEEAT
She is so sexy I love this song 🤭😊
God damn she did so good the solo dance was like WOW I was shocked and happy and surprised at the same time girl keep going Chloe😘
Nothing exceptional  from my point of view. I was expecting more from her
She trying to be Beyoncé
I can't even hold a conversation on the stair master. I don't know how she can sing like that while she dances.
She did that!!
VMAs was better! Beyonce still pushed off the cliff!
She’s good, she is a performer 🔥❤️
Ritual vibes
Pure talent! She did that.🤯
Io mi chiamo Chloe
Phenomenal performance 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
It was the end fa me
oooooooo YA!!!!
I'm late but it's giving Queen B 👸
Not a lot of people can work a stage and command attention as a solo artists from the jump like this. I’m so proud of her, she holds her own up on stage with full confidence 🤩
She has an awesome voice and breath control. But she does NOT sound like Beyonce and isn't trying to... Beyonce has a distinct voice. And a faster and sharper vibrato. But I do think it's Beyonce's voice in the background saying "flossing like I do" softly in the background
I have seen her performance for each award show and she kills it every time. She evolves she learns and it slays everyone. Chloe is a mfkn legend
KILLED ITTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Olha o anjo sogra🤩🤩
That “now what” facial expression at the end
Yessssssssss!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I LIVE
Wow 😍  se rifoo!!!!👏👏👏👏
It’s kind of funny here the “why keep saucing like I do” and” boot so big” in opera singing lol
2:42 can someone pls tell me what the lyrics are at this step part? 🥺👉🏾👈🏾
I’m convinced that people are so used to tone down performances, when someone does something that is not tone down people want to complain and say that artist. Personally, I like to be blown away with over the top performances.
The little laugh at the end of the song gets me every time..she’s so adorable 🥹❤️
People need to pay attention to this girl. She's incredible live which is the true test of skill and talent. She's profoundly talented.. here comes Chloe yall
Baba Chloe did that perfection
I liked this song very   Much 🙇🏼‍♀️💃🏻😘🙃👰🏼💋💄🥰😘👄
How Jesy Nelson thinks she performed at the jingle bell baw
Chloe is phenomenal in everything she does I love her music ❤️❤️❤️
So fire🔥
It was the vocals for me but the mic drop!!! 😍❤❤❤❤❤🔥

Beyoncé level performance !!❤️
This was sooosooooo good
She's so beautiful
The new Beyoncé
I hope shes this generations Gaga i mean by being theatrical and over the top music videos, that is missing in the industry right now.
Not a stan but omg..... this gives me goosebumps . Pure pure pure 🔥
i wanna see chloe perform live so bad she's just amazing
Do we have a studio version of this cover?
From her voice, dance , presentation to her black woman body😩 everything about her screams Queen ❤️👑❤️👑❤️👑❤️
I like this performance better because she is not showing a lot of butt.
Well done young lady!!!
THIS PERFORMANCE LEFT ME SPEECHLESS WITH GAPING LIPS.
She is outstanding and incredible I Luv her soo much
“BoUtY sO bIg LoRd HaVe MeRcY”
She's talented, but she acts like she's just so much BETTER than everyone else. No one's better than God.
Her voice is so smooth even when she's dancing tho
n consigo ver ela,sem ver a beyonce
She just reflects Beyonce to me. Yes I know that he mentor  but.....
its weird people compare her to beyonce 💀 like no shit she's been around her since she was 4
I looooooove chloe
Killedtttt TTTTTTTT ITTTTTT!
She’s amazing!
That performance was everything 🔥🔥🔥
❤️❤️❤️❤️
To the people saying she is Beyonce's clone, that's not an insult dummy💀💀Beyonce is about to be groooown grown it's good there's someone thats coming for her spot. Plus Chloe isn't exactly like Beyonce 😁 she's bringing a lot of new elements in.
Incredible!!
https://youtu.be/5Zf4jl2Jrcw
She has a delicious thick legs
Pftaaaa
Matthew 7:14) because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way , which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.
That's thick, that's perfection. I'm not even human, but this girl is life on a wire. So damn thick. 😍
Actually the singers that will have a big show like this one I don't know what y'all be doing but that was common to go all the way out  showtime
girl u poppped tf off
Ok😏
I hate prerecorded vocals and auto tune cause even if some one singing live there always going be a person saying she lips sync  smh when she not I guess people don't belive some people can do with out it  some don't use that stuff but if u singing really good it prerecorded or autotune  it can't be your real voice over it  🙄
Damn: some women have bodies that go on for miles! (Said the deprived man)
Lawd Have Mercy, work Nubian Princess!
Oversexualized
She ate
I'm obsessed with her!!! you're doing great girl
Who is the choreographer?? I NEED to know
Elle fait comme Beyoncé
I Love You Chloe 💘
OMG SHE ATE THAT!!!!!!!!!
There you go Ma, so you don’t give a crap about what ppl say
I love her so much as artist
I love how much she has evolved music ,I can't wait she brings a album out
Eh not really impressed by her. Song sounds like any other and she looks like a teen. No thanks
I like Beyonce but. I never thought she could sing.  Chloe is pretty, can sing and work her body with no sweat.  Shakira and Cierra are the best dancers yet
1:31 now who's gonna say she's lip syncing
She kill dem wid di dutty wine 🇯🇲

In the infamous words of Lauryn Hill: “Everything you Did has already been Done” … Keep it moving folks! Nothing new to see here…
👏👏👏👏🔥
Fue INCREÍBLEEE
Fireeeeee🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍it’s never the same choreography
NO , PRIVATE, no
Very well performed! Love the Red Locs , she's so pretty too. It's nice to see a natural body on our sistas! 👍💃🙏 🌹
Was this talked about enough or am I under a rock?! SHE WAS GIVINGGGGG
Baby if Sasha Fierce gave birth…this is HER!!!! I livvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeeee. Come on CHLOEEEEE!!👏🏾👏🏾
I found this again and I can assure you that it's still the best performance I've ever seen in years. Her voice is so stable and her dance is just wow. Hoping to see a Treat Me performance soon.
Elevation
It’s very disgusting
Slayyyyyyyy 🙌🏾
10 minute intermission.. thank you
Amazing! Simply amazing. Keep doing you! Not everyone will understand but they will respect it! ♋️
I hope you featuring BTS for your new song
Yes do what you do best chole ❤ switch up each performance 👏
It's sad when perversion becomes so normalized that people no longer even see it! ...and they even applaud it and support it!! Reminds me of what happened to the people of Sodom!
Not impressed 🧿
Q merda
🖤🖤🖤🖤
She really cried throughout this performance. You can see the tears on her face. Love you, Chloë
What's up with her eyes blinking like that with her mouth open on 0:34f that was weird ).Seems like she enjoying herself on stage .Congrats to her !
I ain't even know you was wearing white until the end💊
I love her, no hate here but she is so out of breath
She dope period
What???😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😩so good I just can’t
Some competition for Beyonce its about time
Jungkook was looking for real
🥰🥰
My boo
This entire performance screams beyoncé. I know Beyonce made her run on a treadmill singing for hours she was not going to be out of breath by the time she got on stage.
That girl ate
Gurl came to slay!!
She did amazing , REALLY commend her for taking the VMA feedback and making changes which made it 100x better , I feel like she had a lil talk with Beyoncé for this one 😂
this what jesy nelson thought she did
The serve!!! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Idc idc Chloe fuckin ATE. #SHE FUL
so powerful this woman~~~~
Be Uhew tho, not Beyoncé 😒😏
Her timber is UNIQUE… I love it
Damn… she tries way to hard. Another Beyonce understudy
She is Beyoncé is she had the talent of Cardi lmaooo 👀👀
She killed it!! Who is she she’s amazingly gifted!!👏🏽
She did all the choreo and I am slayed. I’m dead. I went to heaven. 😩😍
That was an amazing performance!!! Energy insane.
you were on growish
And THATS how you zoo it.
She's a clone of Beyonce, where's the originality?
Is it bad that I see Beyonce in almost everything she do? I know that's her mentor and all but I almost feel like she doesn't have an identity YET... Extremely talented and beautiful!
Y’all telling she 'killed' that performance are *DEAD* yourself 💀 ..not bc she's not talented but without LIFE in her . ALL Celebs are SoulLESS 🎭 ,okay bye.
I hope she will find her own persona,  shes very talented but looks all beyonce to me her singing style and dancing costumes all project beyonce, could be wrong but thats what i see and hope that dsnt over shadow all the potential she has as an artist!! Amazing performance though💃🏻
LOL!!!!!!!!  TRASH... Fake!
🧘🏾‍♂️😌 oh my.
So you all want us to be gay right ? hhm that's cool
But it’s still a big NO for me I rather watch the real Beyoncé (my opinion)
I didn’t even know she performed until now. Will Smith stunt even made people forget that Beyoncé performed.
this just made me stupid .. literally killed my braincells ..   cant believe how dumb music is these days ..
My wife & shit
Best performance of the night
Wow what roll models for your daughters 🤣
She is baddddd, but I love her and her sister Haley together!!👏👏👏👏
Her performance was lit🔥🔥🔥..
3:01 HITSSS DIFFERENT❤️❤️❤️❤️
U could dance gorlll
MY QUEEEENN I BOW IN YOUR PRESENCE KISS THE GROUND YOU WALK ON
😲 This is Giving Replicate #Beyonce.. She needs her own identity.. its kool to do a few things as your mentor.  But make your own style.. she is irking.. .Nothing is real not even the dreads
solamente veo estas presentaciones por mis favs, pero cuando la vi quedé impresionada. la amé
i didnt realize she was thick like this damn👀❤️
Wow rap and performance 🎭 another level
This is so sad
literally one of the most FIERCE vmas performances ever.. chlöe and normani are bringing back what it means to be a  pop star tbh
How can we celebrate this depravity??? Open your eyes people
Is a performance this or a ritual people wake up & live an read between the lines.
Ama best performance ever
0:55
Respect
Lil beyonce in training
I need to learn the last part of the dance
Oh, she ATE!!!
And this is by far the most watching from every angels from bts fancam
She actually sings the whole song
Receiving all the powerful doing what's best for you first...you did well Chloe...the trolls out here can't even come close...be about it!
She's extra mega thick
Shout-out to their production in that the sisters switch up the arrangement for different performances so their songs don’t get stale.
I hear + see Beyonce on this one.
I don't care what anybody say chloe is a performer dance,sing and play a instrument keep shining baby girl
Ariel vibes
Chloe you are amazing 🤩
U murdered that lighskin💙👑😘
💍💍💍
Beyonce did the job with those girls especially Chloé trained them well.
You know the Industry going to tell her to slim down some probably 10 lbs, that's what they do No Doubt 🎶
🔥🔥🔥🔥

Go head 👏👍❤🙏🥰
She did that shit like it was rehearsals😍😍😍 AMAZING!

Beat performance I’ve seen of this song so far
All I gotta say is Beyoncé teaching them well and we'll see 🙏🏾💪🏾😘
The way Chloe killed this performance and looked absolutely stunning. And also all I can think about is rn reaction cause I have seen so many videos of him reacting to this and he looked so excited😂😂
Ladies & gentlemen this woman here Cloe is the definition of perfection idc she’s so damn pretty I’m stuck 😂plus she’s all natural god bless her always I love you already queen if I ever hit the jackpot I swear your mines 💯💪🏾😂😎
A fuegooo, que poder de presentación 🔥🔥🔥
The heir apparent to Beyoncé

Oooooh Hunnay have Mercy!!!😘
Girl is fire!😌
Just bad af😖😩🙈💗💗🦾😌🙏🏽
YAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSS GIRL U KILLED THAT 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😍😍
Chloe , Normani ,& Doja are the holy trinity of this decade and they’re going to dominate the entire Music Industry 🔥
The beginning is wowwwwwww
POV: you here because of the reaction BTS had
Very nice performance 👏 👌 👍 😀
No se supera nunca
Loved everything about this performance I loved her face at the end like yes I did that. I’m a bad bish.
So I was watching her VMA performance and people were saying that she was lip syncing. Like hello? How does this sound like it’s lip synced? It sounds so authentic and live.
Simple people brainwashed by the media, you look stupid with those masks on.
She’s Like what you got to say this time around huh ❤️❤️❤️😜
🔊🎶🎶🎶🎶
Her solo album is going to be fire 🔥
DES PRO-UNION ????????????????????? WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT??????????
DES PRO-UNION ????????????????? 0.0 0.0 0.0
MAIS EEEEEEEXTREME EXTREME
Why can't you use a head set chloe?
Vixi mais uma beyondemon
The biggest of the era !
This performance is so much better than the  VMA performance. Keep progressing lil sis!
I like it when she SINGS LIVE this was too much for no reason. Plus she did NOT need all those dancers she is ENOUGH!
How to ride and surf lol cholie I would like that she pretty lol
Beyoncevibes fr
She did absolutely a perfect performance.she danced so hard and kept her vocals flawless that's what's up Chloe!!
She did her shit period🤪🤪🤪🤪
I'm adding this you're doing a very good job Miss cut Chloe Bailey I love you love you love you country style City style love you baby God bless you more to come stay blessed be you and only you don't let nobody take that away from you the world is not right be you young lady God bless you and many more the Nolen Family pp
I need a studio version of this!
She sound like Sasha fierce
Please see bts’ reaction to this 😭😭😭😭
She did absolutely AMAZING! She's coming into her own!!!!!
I think she should use a face mic when she’s planning to dance cause she’s a full body performer
Them face move though it's like doo doo doo
Chloe is probably the only performer today who can ACTUALLY pull a Beyoncé without looking ridiculous. Props to her, she’s got the pipes and the moves!
Excellent I couldn't even take my eyes off the screen I thought I had missed something or I would miss something but I think I blinked so I better go back and watch it again cuz I'm sure I miss something
Girl you can teach beyoncé a couple of things she never been able to perform live like that and not get tired it's better you said in your music cuz I know exactly what this means you can teach a whole lot of them how to be a lady first then we can move on to the dance makeup and music class out
The new Beyonce?
Love you Chloe B.
Vocals on point. I hate comparing artists, but she really gives young Bey 😍
Do not worship these idols. Satanists stealing your time and energy. Jesus Christ is the way the truth and the life. No man gets to the father in Heaven without Jesus They wish to drag you to hell These wicked celebrities conjure up demons.
2:40
Baby girl is from Twerkmenistan!!!!! Yassssssssss yassssssssss yassssssssss
In my opinion the rituals are getting stronger
The camera work here was awful
The Choreographer deserves an award for this 🔥🔥🔥🔥🏆
what are the words they were chanting in the end?
Aye, Yas girl!  No mfuckin crumbs
was this Beyonce??...oh it's Chloe...
essa sim tem fôlego
The dancers are so good
2:42 😍😍❤️ OMG ! 👩🏾‍🎤💃🏾

When you sound like the album dancing in heels 🙌🏽! Go awf Chloe ❤️
I just glad 😊 she can finally be herself 💯
Maravilhosa
Watched this a million times and all I can say is wow!!!
This is a fantastic way of how I say I like to show respect to America 🇺🇸 for growth and development of earth protection for an equally positive role mode as I am not who you think we gotta work work positively 🔥🔥🔥🔥😇😇😇😇😇😇
hey I'm here again i can't stop watching it 🥺🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️
Love everything about her, can’t believe some people hate this song 😭💔 I’ve been obsessed with it for so long now and she sounds amazing
2022 February loveeeeee this performance
I'm literally watching this often and being inspired! OMG BAILEY THE QUEEN!!
I hear Beyonce's voice in the background. Chloe is just being used as vessel to promote trash. Bunch of witchcrafts and weird nonsense.
hate when people do "the clap" during live performances 🙄😩😫
She a wonderful talent. I love her.
does anybody have the lyrics for the step team breakdown?
!!!!!!!!!! Yessss another 1 pleaseeee
Chole your so amazing🦋Wow
Chloe has changed over the years in a beautiful way ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥💖💖💖💖
Chloe killed this

Okay we get it she is grown! Come out with some grown shit please we need you to get us through this time Chloe and/or Halle!!!
Its live if you're confused.
Lord they don't even attempt to hide the shit any more🤦🏾‍♀️
Can we appreciate the dancers? Daaamn, what force, what bodies, can't take my eyes off! You go girls<3
Muito fodaaaaaa essa mulher amei a apresentação!
Waaay better than her vma performance 👌🏾, the hair, the outfit, the choreo, everything looked so sharp and clean.

That old serpent got Meagan and all the rest of em parading around like whores. And y'all love it.
Saweetie thought she was serving this 😭

Omg this was amazing the choir at the beginning and the girls talking towards the end really put a spin on the song and performance I loved this😩🔥💯❤️‍🔥

Yea...she is CLEARLY beyonce's protege. Image AND vocals.

She’s learning!
Beyonce whooo

I love Chloe and this song but she be looking possessed like MF lol
You killed it Chloe proud of you. Just be yourself, work hard but Give Almighty God praises and he will take you to New heights
I can’t lie she ate this performance
Yasssss Chloe! When you started dancing, my eyes got watery and I started clapping too. I felt like I was looking at my daughter perform on stage😆. Great job young lady! Great job! 👏🏽 👏🏽
The one and only Chloe Bailey
My favourite live performance of 2021 ❤️
Yes yes....love her
Amazing!! 😍🔥 El final maravilloso 🔥
The "b o o t h e e s o b i g" tho 😂😂😂
I love the sample and the beat with the rnb vocals. The intro with the chorus. 🔥🔥🔥🔥👍👍👍😭😭
This performance was 90% dancing. Performers don’t even sing anymore. This wasn’t good at all.
TALENT...... PeriodT. Just like when she and her amazing sister, they change up their own songs and it seems like a new song. Go on Ms. Chloe...... live in your own glory.
Me encantó
She’s a really good dancer!
ayeeeee🖤
Alright Chloe alright. I love it.
Istg thoughts on namjoon vibin to it immediately
This is how I pictured many many years ago “if Beyoncé has a kid” thought ( she passes as Beyoncé kid) loved this performance 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
Girl you did the damn thing 🔥
She definitely understood the assignment 🔥 she bodied that 💅
she doesn't sound the same at all it didn't make me enjoy the video ✊
Did she just end with the “suck it” motion?? 😂
On Fire 🔥
We need a Chloe & Mulato song!
My favorite part 2:43
Awesome performance
she deserve more recognition
2022 i will meet you chloe bailey love you 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽💯😫💕
🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍
Magistral ⚡️ I rewatch daily this performance and I don’t how it gets better every time. To the entrance, dancers, looks, stage presence, lights, syncing… to the last detail everything is perfect. And God the red locks 🤧 You are outstanding Chloë💫🔥
No one noticed chole crying and her nose is snotty
That was a that was her
A maior de todas ❤️
She is the queen of  performing 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why does she have to copy Beyònce?🙄aweh she needs to be herself . The real her.
I’m in love 😍
Amém🥰🌬
She’s my grle
This was an amazing performance! Great job everyone!
Look at her face. Wow, she just performs while tears (I hope of happiness) run down her face. This girl is awesome
MAJOR Bey vibes!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯
A pesar de que me encanta como canta la chica, creo que se están cargando o mejor dicho opacando su nombre CHLOE con tanta copia, imitación o como queráis llamarlo a Beyoncé, entiendo que sea la madrina musical de la chica pero de eso a quitarle su personalidad o su esencia musical para sacar otra Beyoncé, no me parece correcto, la chica lamentablemente es una simple copia de Beyoncé y es una lástima porque tiene talento de sobra para brillar como lo que es CHLOE
Chloe ur so beautiful ! love this song !
holy crap, she was actually singing? for a sec i doubted it.. omg... she is so powerful
2:42 the moment before the killing blow.
omg
She was stunning omg. Her stage presence is on another level and her vocals too, im obsessed.
I DONT HAVE ANY PICTURES OF THIS WHEN I WAS THERE BECAUSE I WAS SO EXCITED
Is this Beyonce reborn or what....she does everything like Beyonce....her styles is Beyonce
Can't we just love her? Her attitude, her talent and her passion are excellent in every performance. Dont be haters!!
I'm in love with this song. Love you, Chloe
Ela é a própria Beyoncé
She thick must of had surgical
After that performance she need to teach me a couple things😍awesome performance 👏
She’s soooo cute. Like legit adorable. I really do love her sexy side. It’s great for her badass performances. But the sweet side on the daily is such a big part of her personality and I appreciate it too
She ate it up!
She kept it simple and nice enjoyed
Am I the only one who does not see or feel like she's trying to be beyonce? She has always had that sass and power she just happens to be good at dancing, singing and stage presence....  you guys are the ones pulling out comparisons down to hair colour and stuff like beyonce is the only one who can have that hair colour 😭
ButY SoOo biG AHhhAhaAHHA i loved it though it was an amazing entrance
That talking part should be a part of the song
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🙏🙏
Beyoncé could have found her rightful heir
Watching her talking about this performance she said she was crying the whole performance... I thought it was just sweat 😅.. but it's great it didn't make her voice crack or throw her off I probably would of been so wrapped up in my emotions and been all over the place 🤣🤣🤣
Sheeeesh
Mamma!mamma she did that!!! Yaaaz queen
bts was there to
34 sec what was that
She did that!!!
I love how Chloe and Halle are so vocally amazing that no one can even compare to how good they both are! What gets under my skin is why Chloe has to shake her ass to get views. This song is hot but clearly the lyrics get her to loosen herself and use her body to get more  attention yet her vocals alone should be able to get anyone’s attention! There’s no reason why these young very talented girls should even perform sexually to get attention and yet here we are. Their older music actually have meaning to them and don’t need to be sexualized like every other song on the radio. Does every artist in the industry need to sexualize themselves to be known everywhere?
El cuerpazooooo Dios mío
She's not the next beyonce she's the next Chlöe the queen
She rocked it !!! Love it!! ❤️
Yeah Troyce was right🥴
HAVE MERCY!!!
The last part gave me Beyoncé Coachella vibes, but she took everything and made it into CHLÖE. I’m so excited for her debut album
Ooookrrrrrrr Giiiiiiiiiiiiiirl👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
que voz!! como ela consegue performar desse jeito e se manter tão estável, eu me apaixonei por ela depois de assistir essa performance
At 2:18 and 2:33, you can see that she is crying🥺🥺 She's so passionate about her craft!
Chole said on her New Years Instagram Story that she was in tears thru the whole performance.
The next Beyonce ♥️😍
2:41 Chlöechella??? Amazing
wap 2.0
Let’s just take a moment to also get into the deep feminist imagery though?   Like the choreography and pink motifs are giving me pussy on 🔥 while Medusa, a priestess of Athena, was turned into a Gorgon by Athena as “punishment” because she was r*ped by a man who attempted to destroy the temple she prayed at.   However, a common feminist reading of this is that Athena did this to Medusa so that *Medusa would never have this atrocity happen to her again.* A lot of  anti-ed blogs are named after Medusa as well - having a relapse and need help? Ask Medusa.   Chloe out here fighting the good fight AND giving all of us some great bops. Please put respect on her name.
This performance really different from music video performans. I think her voice  is not real as shown.
You can tell Beyonce is showing her the ropes right down to her facial expression at the end of the song.
Happy New Year 🎊🎆🎆🎈2022
Go, Girl!
Mama Bey is proud !!!!!!!
I need a studio version of this
2:17 & 2:33 she was actually crying😭🥺😂
Chloe said she was crying on her story I can tell but she did that 👏🏾 love you chloe 2022 gonna be lit🔥
Last time watching this in 2021🙌🏾🔥🔥💕
I KEEP COMING BACK 15× ............MY GOD
she killed that i am in LOVE with her 🙇🏽‍♀️
She was crying the whole performance. That amount of passion is so missing in today’s artist. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Each performance gets better and better and on top of that she can sing and dance and still sound good while doing both!
It its true that she take a lil bit of beyonce in her. Everything she did was reminds me of beyonce but is that a bad thing ? Absolutely not. Chole is still chloe. Legendary performer like beyonce cant die just like that. Somebody needs take to continue the crown.
Back here Bc she said she was crying during this performance and she legit was….she hid that so well tho. I wouldn’t of knew if she didn’t say anything…a true performer
2:42 "You can't live without me because my ass but I don't need ya -- And I don't need ya ass! Shakin' (Lord, Have Mercy!) From the left (Left left) From the right (Work! Work!). All this ass up in my jeans you cannot get up in between trying to get a piece of me? I'm gonna teach you a couple things (Work!)" If anyone was wondering what she said during the step routine.
fun fact: Chloe was crying throughout this whole performance
Yoooooooo I I ammmm Mount!functioning!
Que Maravilhosa
eu amo que a Chloe faz um conceito todo angelical pra cantar sobre bunda!!!!! Rainha🤧🧡
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥!!!
i swear i come back to this shit everyday cause girlllll eat up
Amazing performance!! 💪💪
Funny how they all dress like Beyonce now. The uni with no legs and booties or high heels.
She is really amazing. Love love you girl
Dreamed about you Chloe💭 Singing a song called SAMALEKUN🎶 Don’t know what that means but it sounded 🔥🔥🔥🙌🏾🦋

Stop comparing her to Beyoncé. If she was white nobody would even think about this comparison
Can you Say slay
She is so gorgeous. 💘💘
A month later & this performance still has me in a chokehold 😭😭 ! She really ATE
That voice and the choreography is soooo  amazing👏🏻💞
Bitchhhhhhhh this was amazing!!! I am screaming
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥵🥵🥵
Ngl I’m YEARNING for the studio version of this 🥺🖤
Just like beyonce shes totally a diffrent person on stage
Beyonce can clone herself. Wow!
Now thats a performance
She was a lot more chill in this performance compared to the VMAs. I think that’s a good thing!
Um arraso, ela não decepciona nunca ! Mas não supera a performance dela no MTV(VMA's), lá ela botou fogo no palco todo !!!! 🔥🔥🔥
There is only one Beyoncé and I feel this is a mini Bey knockoff. Nothing special. Sorry. I said what I said.
Miss Chloe I know you want to have your own identity but girl baby Beyonce You Finna kill it for the next 15-20 years I'm not even your age group I'm 60 and I am so proud of you showing off you what you was blessed with work the room girl work the room
I was thoroughly impressed 👏 the girl has stage presence and can dance her behind off kudos to her
She did the most LOL
Her voice is very good but i hate how the industry pushing that "sex appeal" rapper image on her 🙄
Smh..from classy to trashy..
giving me beyonce vibez. biggest fan from kenya
Jesus Christ 💗u
Not ashamed to say...THE LUST IS REAL ON MY PART🤣
This was an amazing performance from her. It didn't feel as if she was trying too hard, it was all very natural, precise, and polished. I like her VMA performance as well but this is leagues above her first performance of this song. I love the song and I'm happy to see her star power rise with every performance.
Sweet
Felt Beyonce in this jam
I want people to give her time to grow as an artist. A lot of our favs had to grow into the artist we love today. She  got this!
Yall are tone deaf. The first VMA performance was way better
Amazing just amazing♥️♥️♥️♥️
cool girl😍
It really just feels like Beyoncé 2.0
Yes chloe! You are that girl
Lmaooooo look this bish is a STAR, it’s undeniable. I can’t look away when she’s performing, every second is ENTERTAINMENT. She’s unique & extra & puts her all into it. I appreciate her hard work.
She did that 💃
Its a Beyonce clone and Im here for it
If anybody dares dislike this video.. I'm gonna sue you to court bitch😂😂😂😂
She's fuego 🔥💥💣
mami entregou tudo nessa performance, é a minha favorita
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Chloe keeps eating and not leaving anything for us. Lord have mercy!! 🔥🔥🔥
She reminds me of beyonce, i love the fact that she had locks
That’s right baby girl 🔥 Just cause you got it, you ain’t flaunting it. You’re saving it for something special Queen 👸🏾
This is so much better than the VMA performance!!! Choreo was clean
This person is literally killing SUGA 🆘 like had cut his head, injury his leg  I dont think we will see YOONGI. Or the YOONGI we remember after all the trauma he probably done suffer already
Eu to completamente sem estruturas, senhor
SCRRRRRRRRR🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🥵🥵🥵😍😍😍😍😍😍
She can teach you a couple things
https://youtu.be/x2896j1EGGQ k
I love her outfit.
not a fan of her. but she killed this and sounds so amazing live
SLAYYYYYYYY
Oh this was fire !!
Baby boy da Beyoncé estar diferente
I love this song
OH MY GOD
Shes the Britney yaw.
Her VMA performance still needs 2 be on here.
Her AMA performance still needs 2 be on her.
We need to start giving credit to these backup dancers. Doing all that high energy choreo + jumps in heels, skin tight outfits and a MASK...
Still can't get over this. She really killed this performance, and she is only going to get better. Still jamming Have Mercy, but can't wait for the next song as well. Love her!
she,s made of skin,she's hooked on wine,she's make me fly,Make me hit the sky.....
Greatest performer rn idc
I Hope all the beyhive have noticed the babyboy move :)
She LITERALLY out of breath... But she cover it amazingly with her dance... So .... Win win solution 😍
Como se supera ?🤩
she is dancing AND singing live her voice is soooo 🔥🔥🔥
Am I the only one getting Beyonce vibes from this performance??🥴
You can tell Chloe is involved with beyonce. The choreography was so beyonce like. So good 👏
What are they chanting in the last part of the performance?
I don't want no one saying how she "barely sang" but complain how everything else "isn't live." Pick a struggle. Pick a fucking struggle.
i’m back because you ate downnnh
Chloe making it both religious and sexy 🥵🔥🙏❤️
The end though😍😍
Ok, someone help me out... I could have sworn I seen a different live performance other than this or the vmas.. which one is the very first live performance?? Tell me I'm not tripping cuz I can't find it anywhere!! 🤷🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
No one has their own style anymore. 😜
I can’t believe the level omg I’m shakin
🥰 that’s right Chloe 🥰 remind the world how beautiful  and sexy natural black women really are 🤗💯👏🏾🙌🏾👏🏾🙌🏾👏🏾🙌🏾👏🏾 love this performance 🥰 ima get locks too

What is amazing is although people complained about her VMA performance ,it wasnt bad 😭🤣. I can watch that shit and still get goosebumps. That is amazing.
Queeeeeeeeen
She killed this one!!!
Chole out here representing for her Godmother Bey lol
Now this is an artist I would go and see on tour. She has definitely came a long way and I'm excited to see her grow and explore. The fact that I can hear her voice and enjoy it also the fact that it's not over sexualized. Very classy, she looked like she could've done this all day. Excellent Queen!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
SHE IS THE NEXT ERA OF CULTURE OMFG CHILLS😩😩😩😩❣️🤞🏽
Crazy talented
Babylon repent! For the Kingdom of God is at hand! The Bible says it is appointed for all men to die once and then comes the judgment. Get your life right with the only who can only make things right! The Lord Jesus Christ 🙏🏽 this world 🌎 is passing away but God’s word stands forever.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎶🎶🎶🎶💃💃💃💃💃👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 STANDING OVATION BABY GIRLLLL YASSSSS 10'S ALL ACROSS THE BOARD!!!!

Beautiful performance!!! I adored her VMA’s performance much more (her energy was so raw and undeniably her! Never understood how ppl thought she was dOiNg tOo MuCh)but don’t ever get it twisted she NEVER disappoints 😮‍💨🔥✨
Not as hot as the VMA performance,but still enjoyable non the less
I need to know the chant @ 2:43 😩😩
🔥🔥🔥
Our queen . You slayed it , you killed it , you gave it all. All of your backup dancers just like follow leader. You are a great dancer, singer , actress , rapper and even choreographer wow
The prostitution in the music biz is crazeeeee!! Damn, I'm tired of our young ladies being tricked out, especially with the amount of talent we possess. That $ in exchange for their souls is powerful. SAD!!😞
I hope u can take this stuffing😏
Her and Normani gotta do a song together😩
Chloe ate...PERIOD!
I love how every performance Chloe does with this song is different. Like can we please give it up for the talent. 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿

It’s the note at 2:35 on that “Take it, Take it there” 😍

INITIATION RITUAL IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY
I am becoming a fan
This was the best performance of the whole night
So pretty
She killed it. Beyonce boss vibes for me. Keep that same energy Chloe
She MF DID that!!!! You better go young lady! The entrance, the looks, the voice, the moves, you got it sis! Ugh LOVED this!
Ok babe we see you😘
Oh my f#ck. How is it even possible to make such an amazing live creation like 2.9 trillion times better 🔥
I'm kinda obsessed with this performance
Good form Nicki Minaj copy cat
That mic is on 💯💯💯💯
Love this song 😩
WAIT- STOP THIS IS HER SONG???!!! I'VE BEEN HEARING THIS IN EDITS BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IT'S HERS WTF 😭😭😭😭
It's over for you Beyoncé, Lol
Something very off-putting about this. The eye roll and the tears and snot and red eyes, she looks high on something. I'm just not here for it. I be tryna be, but I'ma have to sit this one out 🪑 this is shortly after the late night porno vibe post and delete thank you message, argue with ya mammy clover kisses 😂
She’s literally a copy of Beyonce…. Singing a song about her p and how her ass is fat while dancing seductively….all these songs are the same. Why are women of color reduced to big asses being their only value?   She’s no longer using her voice or platform for anything meaningful she’s just another woc reducing herself to the hyper sexual persona every other female artist has. It’s not about singing it’s about aesthetic and marketing pandering to the male gaze. Writhing onstage and singing about sects, literally exuding the misogynistic stereotypes feminists say they hate… this isn’t empowering. Singing and acting raunchy sets women back decades. When I see woc doing this I wonder if Sarah Baartman was alive what she would think of these public displays.
Chloe is crying why performing 😢😭
I can't believe I'm saying this I can't believe I'm just not seeing this Chloe is crying can anybody tell if you came zoom in on her face she is crying while performing she is so beautiful and amazing I love her please don't crying it breaks my heart ❤️😢😭
Why is this in 720p 😅
This was GREAT. Might be my favorite performance of this song so far
What the?
Extremely entertaining!! I ain’t gone lie, it’s refreshing!!
I need this version on spotify choleeeee babyyy🧡😏
Loove the red locs yessssss
Presentación épicaaaaaaas
how did bts reaction to this
Loving these extensions on her.
I'm seeing a lil Beyonce with her moves
Chloe’s making the kind of music I didn’t know I needed. Not only is the sound good she performs live all the time. Immaculate dancing. Damn
Yasssssss Chloe 🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍😍😍
This girl could be the next beyonce
🔥🔥🔥🤘
I can hear Beyonce on this performance
were those tears apart of the performance? i know she plays a character with this song but i just noticed what apears to be her crying at 2:32
A negona é boca de escopeta 😱😘
Will burn broadway down live..total performer
Mulher performa mais pelo amor de Beyoncé.
This is up there ⬆️on the list of my all time favourite performances, she really killed this 🔥
Her best performance of Have Mercy yet!! Love seeing her grow in his individual artistry
yes
That's how LIVE sounds 🔥 NO lip sync ❌
the comments forced her to not be fully herself smh
Okay she SNAPPEDT AGAIN! 😌🥺❤️✨
I see a beyonce written everywhere I look
The backups doing that in face masks tho!  😷 🤯❤️
I think she found her niche with performing this song now.
She did that
This is by far one of the best performances of chloe Bailey, simple, classy, sexy and professional. Love to see more of this! 🔥🔥🔥
3:16 she gave everybody that look like “ Now what “ , you can definitely tell she improved so much since her VMA performance! She slayed
beyoncé must be so proud of her daughter
beyoncé vibes🔥
Yes ma’am
This is sooooooooo BEYONCE!
Pure nasty and of the devil
anyone wanna joins me if haters say " shes too much " let smack their ass !!!
who is just looking proud like parents when bts reacting this masterpiece 😭
her performances keep getting better and better ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
the fact that she is just debuted , i love all the fire she got !!! 😘
Just dance if you want to , you dont have to hold mic 😂
https://youtu.be/OA6NEWoelJI
Can’t stop watching this !!
this is embarassing. why does she stomp on stage. she needs kitten heels to make her walk more gracefully
This is her Say So moment
Isn't that Beyoncé's move from baby boy at 2:30?
Off The Map.Take Off!
Where's that other video of her performing :'(
This is the best presentation because they finally gave her a well thought out choreography.
Who notices that Beyonce is one of the backing dancers. She is beside her the whole performance. She even takes the mic from her near the end.
Chlöe did a GREAT job in her AMAZING performance!!!!! 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👍🏿👍🏿😊
Bet she won't make another good song
Bakit parang ginaya ang mga concepts ni Beyonce? 🤔
I can tell what will be BTS reaction but why chloe u did really great
I’m a week late to view this in high definition, but I’ve seen the phone recorded versions and was still as entertained.
Wow!!! The energy and confidence
Shes going to Beyonce replacement good job!
Remind me of beyonce
ay
Werk it Chloe!
Yassss❤
She ate and left no crumbs😍 ♥
She gives me Beyonce vibes!! But nobody can be queen B lol. Nice performance
to much Beyoncé and not enough Chloe
Massive improvement from the VMAs performance 👏
Chole said stop playing in her face 😈 I live for it
I’m in love ! 😍😍😍 She could be this generation’s Beyoncé
collab with Minaj
Only ojs remembers her from let it shine
big ciera vibes
The best performer of this generation.
The love version sounds so much better.
So much better than the VMAs. This was a great performance
que presentación tan impresionante dios, chloe sos hermosa
She sounds so good even she's dancing she can control her voice that's amazing
I fee Ike she’ll be the next Beyoncé of our generation
OMG! THE LIVE VOCALS ARE OMG!!! SO SO SO BEAUTIFUL
Best song of the year
And fuck what y’all talm bout. Beyoncé is proud! She did that.
Absolutely amazing her voice is a gift
Her best perfomance yet.She keeps getting better
YESSSSSSSSS chloe im in loveeeeeeee with this performance and the outfit hair dances moves and the dancers and ending was everything 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤
AMAZING JOB AS ALWAYS BABE!!!!
Not my type of music but meh.
I would've loved to hear her singing live on that intro
Rm breaking the backrest 😩
.
Have mercy!!
I just want to know who said she didn’t have it Beyoncé the Queen herself said she did wtf you go against that !!!!!! Team Choile team B
La Nueva Beyoncé!!!
I love the fact I grew up watching yalk
😭😭😭🎉
First time ever hearing or seeing her. Damn this was an amazing performance!!
Why people think Chloe can't just have grown fun Lord Have Mercy
Im here for it 🥰💕
Damn now that Iggy retired she is the best rapper/performer
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You all keep fussing about wanting to hear her true vocal skills but they're more concerned with selling yall sex because sex sells.
This performance is an upgrade from the VMAs
Purrrr she better be learning from Beyoncé
SHE IS AMAZING!!!
I don't like this song... But I like her
Good performance but I hope she sings songs that have more meaning and show her beautiful voice. This is a Saweetie song and she is destined for bigger things.
Have mercy
I love it but it has Beyoncé all of it yess chole you better work and apply that pressure
Not me watching this everyday religiously lmao 🤣💀
Well dam*! She killed that  sh*t.
She killed it
I'm afraid she served
I love me some soulful and powerful vocals, but Chloë has every right and reason to want to evolve and to test her boundaries. As it’s been said by others, she has enough material that proves that she is an ultra-talented vocalist - she to me, is taking this time to develop aesthetic and presence and I think that only proves that she’s the whole package. She CAN sing, but she can own a stage and serve as a performer too. I’m here all the way for hernew direction. Let her feel herself out and be multi-faceted. Nobody is one dimensional. Besides, while I feel like her new material will focus on female empowerment and owning your sexuality, I’m sure the album will have a sprinkling of what we know to change up the pace. I hardly think she’s done with songs she has to SANG, just taking a detour and having fun being her own artist
It's crazy how many people come back to this everyday.This song is legendary♪
Wow, All the work it takes to pull this shit off is amazing. Love it.
Not as good as the other performance
TAKE NOTES: Chloe will teach you a couple things! You BETTER PAY FUCKING ATTENTION!! Because right now! RIGHT FUCKING NOW!! She's educating other entertainers how to do this SHIT!! (she's a hard working woman respect)
Yeah totally
Seems satanic. Don't know why.  But no.
That was a nice performance Chloe
Chile, somebody pissed her off, because when she threw her hands up & that look at the end was like and what slim or biatch🤣?
She is trying to crossover get over it
She can sing and perform ❤️ I just love her energy!
56
i'm getting the queen b's vibe..
One of the best performers and vocalist of Gen Z!
She said now what....
Stupez
Too much Beyonce not enough Chloe…. Great performance regardless
Best performance by far. Felt very natural
you can tell she was hungry and mad!!! i love her energy. she's also so cool off cameras
She can hardly breathe
Out of all have mercy promotions I love this one the best SHE DID ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
$$$$$
It was playback right? Well regardless not original for me…still too much like Beyoncé
oof. she doesn't look like she's enjoying herself. girl, if you need help, say "spinach".
Beyonce's twin
Chloe just keeps getting better and better ✨😌
Was she crying?
Mini Beyoncé this my shit
She hit a million finally..BEST PERFORMANCE OF THE NIGHT!
She seemed a lot more nervous and contained and scared here. I think she’s filled to the brim from all y’all criticism
Só não faço igual porque não estou de tranças vermelhas.
I'm so confused why aren't Halle and Chloe together? 🙄😭
This song and “Love Me” by Lukaz are literally the only two things getting me through hard times, thank god for music! I love you. 💝
This is just too good 💀😩
Pues que se puede esperar de esta talentosa chica.... Esta siendo entrenada por una de las mejores cantantes del mundo BEYONCE!❤  Su carrera está apenas empezando y ella esta por lo más alto ya! Será muy pronto una de las más extraordinarias superstars!! Chloé me encanta! Ella es perfecta! Tenia ratos largos que no veía una presentación así... Cantando en vivo y tremenda Choreografia a la vez!!! Yesssssss❤😍😍😍💯💯💯 DINAMITA PURA💥💥💥💥💥
I wanna see BTS reaction to this☺
Killing it. So good
Well damn. Show out then Chloe! I’m so proud of how far she has come. Yes, we know she can sing ppl but she’s doing something that she loves so let her experiment with her craft how she wants to. This not about y’all.
https://youtu.be/RsqINIHKEJg
I expect a better code of conduct. I wish Chloe all the best for her future, if this is how she wants to express herself, who am I to judge🙄🤫🤐😁
I ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Her and Normani making a song 🤔 will make history 🥲
Copia de beyonce
She reminds me of Britney spears.  If she plays her cards right she could be the next princess of pop
I loved the performance period.
She absolutely killed this n will keep getting better!! Follow the blueprint Chloe u got this girl!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Time for a new song sis

Demonic

Insane ❤️❤️
this is so hot u girl ate the stage
It would’ve been iconic if she was flexing her vocals along with the choir, that’s the only little thing that was missing for me. Just to let ‘em know she’s still singing. 🌶
Chloe... have mercy on us pls!! 🔥🔥🔥
Chole thinks she's Beyonce!
Stop letting them invade our music #FreeChole✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
Wayyyy better performance. Really good!
Her fucking breathe control??? It's on another level omfg

That's a goddess right there
Beyoncé said, let me rest but ama give you Chloe in the meantime
🔥 ❤
I wish normani performed
What happened to the singing though??? Her ritual looks on pointe
Chloe slayed this performance! :) I liked this performance! :) "You can't get this thickness out of your mind!" :)
Here at 999K 🙃
Queen Aphrodite who...
This performance 😍😍😍
i love it i love her
OMG!!!! YOU´RE SO AMAZING!!
unpopular opinion but the beginning didnt make sense it was a completley diiferent vibe to the song i didnt see the point to it it BUT idc coz she slayed it such an amazing performer!
Great voice, dancing and stage presence! I’m a fan!!!
Illuminati
I keep coming back it's just that good
Oh she fucking ATE!! We love to see it. Love to hear it. Love to stan it.
This is great. She's a good dancer, the music is awesome and she looks amazing, I just wish she had a more powerful voice (like Beyoncé) during the choreography. Her voice sounds a little weak.
Damn. That stage design.
“He can’t live without me cuz my ass fat” LMAOOO THE CHANT AT THE END I LOVE IT
come through with the step
Amamos 🇧🇷❤
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
OMG 😭😭 I WANT TO SEE HER LIVE!!!😭😍😍😍😍
How would it be if the lyrics weren’t always so vile and sexual.
Yesssss Gurl 🧨🧨💣💣
I have watched this a million times and I am still not over it. Chloe killed it
Como sempre, MARAVILHOSA!!! Like a angel
She's gorgeous
Yasssss girrllll ❤❤❤ so fire 🔥🔥 i wished the first part had more singing so Chloë can show off her ANGELIC 👏 BOMBASS 👏 MOTHER 👏 FREAKIN 👏 VOICE! and the last part can be ALL ABOUT that dance break y'all! Chloë is everything and more, so i get that shes tryna show up for ALL DEM CATEGORIES! I swear if she turn this song into a 10-minute serenading, acting, rapping, dancing  flaunting  anthem i'd sign up for all of it !
You better get it, girl!
I am simply in love with everything about this performance and her😩🤌😍
so amazing
How many are here after watching BTS reaction 👀??!
Now I know thjs isn't the little girl that was in Tyler Perry's 2008 movie Meet The Browns! And the little girl that was singing holy music with her little sister as a child!
bodied this. I really think you'll be proud of this for years to come 🔥
This is my first time hearing this song, and it's giving me beyonce vibes🔥
You NEVER fail to impress
.
I came here after she talked about BTS .she is such a great performer love her.i really loved her performance. One of the best😇😇🥰
WOW!!!

♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
♥️♥️♥️♥️
She so much reminds me of Tinashe🥰👑
She and her sister had such a cool and artistic vibe. Now she’s just like any other, sad.
you killlllled it ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Come on Chloe.
I need the audio version of this performance
she's incredible
แซ่บ
💣💥💣💥💣💥❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Lipsync?
I like how at the end she was like “y’all happy”😂😂😂
She is so talented,  hate to say it but she reminds me off beyonce only in small times
To much Beyoncé
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
holy freakin smokes
INCREDIBLE!!
Sasha Fierce came into her 😳
Almost to 1 M let’s keep streaming Chlövers!!! 🤍🍀
You can tell she’s Beyoncé’s protégé
🔥🔥🔥
her breath control is insane
giving me much Beyonce vibes , great performance
1:50 they are the Beyoncé vocal
That drop, spliiiiiiiiiit💯👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Show these girls how to put on a show! Kills it every time!!
All I smell is demonic and Beyoncé y’all could get mad
She killed it!
Chloe used no pre recorded vocals for this performance  This 100% her natural voice while singing and dancing and I loved it
Ladies and gentlemen. . They got her 😩😳😔
Still and will never be Beyoncé.
I like it. But I miss more vocals
Pqp perfeita
The intro was THE best of this performance! Everything else was a Beyoncé 🙄😒 Kelly Rowland should teach B about management.
LIsten. Let the girl have her fun and experiment. That's what this is for. Plus, the red hair looks soooo good.
All young women do is sing about their snatch and shake their behind. It’s pathetic. She’s more talented that this.
💓💓💓
Repent and get right with GOD. KING JESUS CHRIST is returning!
She forgot to lick the mic
She’s is very talented but Normani is better dance singing without having to be overly sexually but she is amazing in her own right
She sold her soul for sure
AYUDAAAA SIENTO QUE ESTA PRESENTACIÓN LA VI HACE TIEMPOOOO YA MAS QUE TODO LA ESCENA PRINCIPAL CON LAS BAILARINAS OMG tengo problemas
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Damn my dream of being the first Chloe popstar is over 😭
the choral intro...insane. truly.
She so sexy 💯🔥
Belíssima
Say goodbye to beyonceee
Another Beyonceeee
Wen ur lol model is behive =chloe
OMG🤯👑❤
Why at 2:33 it looks like she was crying?
Beyonce birthed her.
entregou
QUEEN
só acho q se tivesse sido no brasil, a performance teria sido perfeita, pq essa plateia --   podre de mais
Amazing performance!
Eu acho sempre macabra as prrfimances dessa música . Uma vibe satanista e cerimonial . As pessoas não percebem o que está na cara. A adoração a agenda iluminati e  o ritual oferecido pra glorificar eles . Ela se vende e se oferece no palco  Ninguém nota
Bro I'm gay
Chloe is that girl!🙌
I don't like her anymore
Loved every bit of the performance.
little beyonce <3
🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
U can't tell this ain't powerful
Excessive perversity!!!
This remind me of Nicki Minaj performing Good Form in an award with little mix
How are they singing a trashy song so beautifully??? 😂
Some of y'alls "compliments" are so backhanded. Chloe changes one thing up and all of a sudden yall come out of the woodwork saying all this. Anyway, this was beautiful just as beautiful as VMA. I liked VMA a bit more, but I love this one too. Awesome work Chloe!
You better werk Chloe!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
i kinda miss those days when she’s not lip syncing (which is not a bad thing if any singer is lip syncing), when she sings live, she’s more expressive. still a good performance tho.   no hate towards her tho, i’m a big fan of cxh.   and pls don’t educate me on noticing wether someone is singing live or not, yes you can hear her breathe and how it doesn’t sound like studio version, because she prepared that, it’s called pre-recorded track, she might’ve dance while recording it to make it sound ‘realistic’, but you know, you can still notice em.
CHOICE - FINAL FELIZ (CLIPE OFICIAL)! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slX9lLCdyP4
I keep coming back to this last performance because to me, this is the one that's going to truly catapult and cement her as a long lasting artist in her career. All the comments of "she does to much" and what not was notarized as she gave them the level of entertainment that Beyonce would have in her performances, with a more crisp and classy finish. Her team and herself did well in terms of musical arrangements as it also gave her time to breathe properly during her dances and vocal execution. I'm proud of her and it gives me some form of excitement to see what she does next as an artist. Chloe I'm cheering for you. Keep killing it!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Não sei quem é, mas tá tentando ser a Beyoncé
always supporting 💚🖤💜
FIRE!!!!
WOW, is she the next Beyoncé?
Amazing
Definitely the best of your generation. Keep doing your thing young queen. Remind me so much of aunty Bey and definitely see you being just as big as her. 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🍑lawd have Mercy
Arrasou ... Manteu se afinada mesmo dançando
Beyonce vibes 🥴
Giving Formation vibes
Love me some Chloe 🥰
Wow!!!!!
HER DANCERS KILLED THIS!!
All Beyonce nothing original here.
Any ARMY here who is thinking how our boys survived this?!🤡
Awesome performance and vocals 👏
Entregou tudo cara pqp
No words 🤩🤩🤩🥰🥰🥰🥰
She is thicc af.
Incroyable elle a tout tuer 🤯👏🏾👏🏾
I just love how each time she performs this song, there's different choreo 😍 and that ending makes me smile every time. She was like "now what" 😁
Purr
she snapped
Seen before, too Beyoncé for me, from the performance to the choreography to ent up with the look.
She's the only performer currently giving it her all on that fucking stage kudos to my girl CHLOE!!!
I want😈 BTS member's reaction😉😏😂😂😂😅🖤🖤😏😏🙈🙈😂
Im tired of her already
I hope I can watch this live in front of me, that will be totally legit
Top performer in the game right now. No 1 coming close.
She remind me about Beyonce.. the voice and the dance skill just wowww
Here after kim taehyung reaction 💜
A TRUE PERFORMER! I HOPE HER DEBUT ALBUM WILL FOCUS MORE ON RNB!
Tag yourself I'm that one fan you can hear getting her LIFE over the entire crowd
School of BEYONCÉ. You learned from the best, and you've graduated first class!
Just sing.
can't stop watching this wow
For the people in the comments saying she’s “Lip-singing” go to the fancams with BTS In them. Her mic was very much on she gave what was supposed to be gave and she’s getting better and better as she should I loved this performance. ❤️
I never thought id see so many female powerhouse headliners like we have now. It doesnt matter if they sing or rap our Black Women are owning these stages!!! YESSSSSS!!!!! SO PROUD OF HER!
I’m sorry but I am so mad at the cameraman. How could you move to the side of the stage when the performance was getting 🔥. If you don’t know what I mean…  3:04 - to the end.   Y’all should’ve been cutting to different angles. Who was hired that day?   Some👏body’s 👏 getting👏 fired 👏
3:04 am..In Philly. Just watched....DAMNNNNNNNNN GIRLLLLLLL!!!!!!!! SHE FUCKIN DID THAT CRAZY!!!! WOW
The perfect girl
lmfaoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo SOMETHING is OFF here!... lololololl   It's either the music, or the choreogreo... somethings' off... and it makes her come off as WACK!
Introduce me to his PAPPY! And did
I can’t stop watching Armon Wiggins got it wrong. This is the best thing of the show.
this is like the 10th time ive watched it and im still shook
See this performance was what I was expecting than the other ones that’s she’s done.
KILLED IT
GIRL YOU WE'RE YOU AND YOU WERE BEAUTIFUL YOU WERE THE MOMENT YOU EVEN HAD BTS ON THE EDGE OF THEYRE SEATS
🗣AAYYYEE I liked this!!! GO CHLO GO!!! She just needs to drop another HIT tbh this song cute or whatever but definitely doesn’t show her full potential. Her performances are getting so much better
q lacre mds
Amazing performance and I thought the VMAs performance was great also.🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🔥🔥🔥
Look how far some will go to express themselves, what are they saying though.
I felt like I was watching beyonce.  Wonder if beyonce's ready to let her new young sexy recruit take away all her glory because she can!!!
Yaaaaasssss Chloe woooooo killing It babe I love the break dance woooo twerk it
people need to quit coming for my good sis, folks always critiquing hard-working people. they need to direct that energy toward all these mediocre celebrities and influencers. Chloe out here studying the greats and developing her craft. Can't wait for all the new music, the locals don't know she's a producer and songwriter. Regardless of what she does on social media, babygirl talented.
Lord have mercy.
she is a FORCE!
Yes she did good this time
i just love how bts was in the crowd the entire time....LMAO poor kookie
Her face at the end said is that conservative enough for y’all?
Um yes princess. This was very well balanced however camera man needs a demotion lol. The tears were a wonderful touch.
My favorite performance of hers to date
She is everything! Love her ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Her performances make saweetie performances look like kindergarten 😭
😍👏👏👏👏
the vocals
the beyonce vibes tho
https://youtu.be/0qxk2Ur2frA 🔥
https://youtu.be/0qxk2Ur2frA 🔥
Can y’all imagine a remix and live performance with Normani?!?!?!
Wow just wow, perfect performance from Chloe 🥰
LA ROMPE MUY HIJUEPUT4👏🏼👏🏼❤❤🇨🇴
Please don't
That’s the one! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
God I just keep coming back for this Goddess
What is people gonna do when JESUS com back
THIS QUEEN- 😭😭 SHE IS SO BEAUTIFUL PLZ😭✋😩 Ma’am I think you dropped this:👑
Mulheeer! Pqp 😲😍😍😍
Im so proud me clapping 👏 and screaming 😱 💯
Ate!
She did that ❤️
Terrible singing
Omg
Chloe is a mega-talent. I see the Beyonce - type industry standard performance (which, in her case, is quite alright - guess who her MENTOR is). BUT HER FANS SHOULD REMEMBER AND UPHOLD THAT SHE IS A MUSICIAN.
These souls have been so lost.
How her voice so sweet? Its like pure honey😳
I want a hair tutorial on her dreads. Ik random
ISSOOOOOOO, a gente tava precisando de uma artista dessa na atualidade, entregou de mais.
It's because of this that I keep repeating: Beyonce wah the pioneer of "nigga" - with respect - vibes in the female industry, but right now we have a lot of artists who can do the same that she did. Not inferiorizing Queen B. But at this time, the others deservs the same cheering and respect.
Chloe is so talented
10 years down the road she will sit down with Oprah to explain how she was forced to be sexy/sexual.... 🙄
I like how she wraps her dreads for different performances ..always giving something different .and she gave us Chlochela
Its too unoriginal for me... reminds me of somebody 🤔
meh.😑
I dunno.....feels like a low-rent Beyonce.
Has Beyoncé all over it …
She's a literally goddess
Is it just me or is this giving Nicki Minaj - Anaconda ??!!
Caraca, que mulher foda!! Arrepiada do começo ao fim dessa performance
❤️❤️❤️❤️
i love when she dances...and then the background dancers 🤌🏾
This will go down in the books
I love thissssss❤️❤️❤️ Go girl I'm rooting for you really hard🎉
The performance is stupid and ridiculous where is the vocals
Amazing how everything is turning into something stupid!
Weak singing for her on this performance.
😞
Chloe is a Boss, she slays this song every time she preforms it. I just love her... get it Miss. Thang
Definitely the BEST performance of HAVE MERCY to date💪🏾
Less trash and rachet ! Coolll... Criticising you worked good.
Omg...!!!!
This New Generation of Beyoncé 👌🏽 Perfection.
Maravilhosa
This is her best solo performance to date. She pulled it back and commanded the performance instead of the performance getting away from her. Bravo! I knew she could do it.
Oh my Goodness she killed it!
OMGGGGGG
No i see why BTS breaking their necks and smile while watching
She's like a mix of FKA twiggs and Beyonce
ela tem muito futuro mesmo! mas acho que ela tem que aprimorar bem a dança
The real og's remember when her and her sister were on Disney  channel
That's why people say she sold her soul why is she acting all possessed coming down
I straight up got My Universe performance of AMA after her performance ended & i couldn't skip that😭😭 She's an ARMY too. Well played Chloe 👍💜💜
🇧🇷
Literally the next in line chosen by Beyoncé and people still throwing such shade…the Queen has spoken so y’all can chill
The female performances always show more butt than talent......not saying she's not talented, I'm just tired of seeing the same dance moves jeez.
I just came here to laugh
She's absolutely iincredible!! and all this jumping and dancing just not to be out of breath while singing?! QUEEEN
I get so excited seeing Chloe perform! Give me the energy niece!!!
Need a new song already
Gurllll the hell, hands down best performance I’ve seen in awhile ❤️❤️✨❤️❤️
SHE BODIED THISSS@!!! beyonce better BOOK HER FOR HER TOUR CHILDDD
You can definitely tell that Queen 👑 Bee 🐝 Is her mentor, but she's still giving her own style & vibe! She's amazing!
Im sorry i see a beyonce nicki minaj copy
Love this song but please for the love of my playlist, give us at least one more song before ep or album
CANCER GANGGG!♋📌
I need a collab with Megan
Idc that song makes no damn sense sex sells
A bey descansa tranquila pois seu lagado tá salvo
TUDOOOOOO✨✨✨
She's summoning at the beginning
I feel like I am watching bey
It’s amazing how she can dance, control her breathing and continue to perform. ⭐️
She was the best performer of the night. Exactly what POP needs
This audio?
Good job bae❤❤
Su presencia escenica es increíble, diosaaaa
U go girl
🛐🛐🛐💖👏🏼
<333
Ameeiii
Loveeeeee
She is incredible 😘
Man her confidence is on like a 20 out of 10. She knows that ain't nobody touching her right now
CHLOE!💥💥💫
It's  like I'm  listening  to beyonce
I really wish there was more originality but I guess wat “they” say goes if you wanna last in the industry.  she’s a very talented female, while this was a good performance it’s s played out!! How many artist NOT JUST BEYONCÉ have we seen preform like this? The theme, the way the musics being played,  the choreography EVERYTHING just feel so ritualistic😒 it dont take away frm her actually talent it just don’t broadcast it either 😮‍💨
I guess cause nobody wants to accept that this girl is grown she does too much !!! Keep winning Chloe 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I honestly think her MTVA performance was better💁🏼‍♀️, she did ok here it was still good but not as good she didn’t sing as much here and she sang and danced more at the MTVMA...like she had me hooked
Absolutely killed it
Amazing and Unstoppable. I can't wait to see what's next from her
Beyonce has picked her heir to the throne. Now we watch it unfold
T H I S  I S   A M A Z I N G
Yep!!! that's it. Ja Drama approved...meow....
Nailed it.
Yasss !!! Sista !!!! Girl you smashed it !!!!🤩
Cada presentación es mejor que la otra <3
You killed it, sis! 🗣💝
Not the eye roll at the beginning-
No
❤️👑🔥 #Chlöe  #HaveMercy
Wauw amazing performance!you can tell that Beyonce is her mentor!💕
Is just me all this has beyonce all over it
this one’s better than the first performance, I was scared she’ll be doing TOO MUCH but she’s not here, she’s starting to know how she is and not just copy Beyoncé

Wowwww
The Mic was ON
Now this looked like a Chloe performance. This was waaaaay better than her 1st one. She looked like she was struggling with her choreo that first one because she was trying to do Bey but this one....a slay. We got some Bey we gotta learn yo drop but overall, I see Chloe
https://youtu.be/v_E9szhH9wE
Great job.
Hoseok was breaking his neck trying to see this performance 😂
🛐❤
Beyoncé’s daughter lol Love her
Salvou essa premiação
LENDÁRIA
Good performance. Needs to get a headset thing & not use that mic
The next Beyoncé
I love me some Chloe! #Chlonce’
perfeita
Gosh ...wish I cud dance like that. She's fierce
Yea it’s a no for me Beyoncé need to put in Dance rehearsal around the clock and the fact that they’re pulling all the strings to get her performance in slots is really irritating because you know we all know that Normani is a way better performer than her like Chloe got a voice but sometimes it’s annoying and Normani could do a full set and still keep her voice control I’m not a hater I want to see both of them win But if you ask me Normani first Chloe second and I won’t even give Chloe second because your voice is annoying but OK
But why does every single performance have to start with a catholic reference 🤠
My girl was on the stage mad asf!!! Don’t play with her!
She is good.  The problem is, sometimes she just exaggerates.
Watch it, Beyoncé
She is simply fabulous, I just wish sometimes she put the song on the back, she don't need to sing it all, cuz she dances a LOT, obv it's difficult to sing a long, so let the song do the job sometimes
She has a beautiful voice I’m pretty sure she can do much better than that, that style it seems to me is coming to an end.
performance de milhões
Sorry but Beyoncé is the BEST 🌈
a true performer ✨✨
Waaaaaaay better than the first performance !!!
best performance of the night
QUEEENNN THINGSS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzvaRerfSE
as always your live performance never disappoint queen i love you
Riririrri
Her and normani would have a mind blowing collaboration!
Esta mujer me tiene a sus pies
I can’t get into her🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
Is it me? Does this seem a little satanic? I love her, this just a little weird!
Beyoncé You've created a Monster!
MY BABY BOO!!! EAT EAT EAT EATTT
You can see she studies her craft. She's getting more and more polished. Love to see it.
SHE IS LITERALLY THE MOMENT!!!!! ALSO HER DANCERS😭😭!!!!! SHE FKED THIS SHIT UP👏🏻👏🏻
She dead ça
Bruh she went in u can tell she learnin from Beyonce surprise didn't lick da mic respect her musicality genius gangsta no cap lol stay safe RIP Malikah Shabazz Young Dolph Gunther BLM God bless stop all dis hate checkout The Main Squeeze 🙏

🔥🔥🔥🔥
This performance was so good but the Camera angles was horrible somebody Need a pay cut
Anytime she performs I just see Beyoncé
Okkkk Choleeee u did that lol
Least fav artist . Sorry
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
YESSSSSSS💋💫
The end felt like an anthem
Amazing 🔥🔥🔥
Omg yea this performance was it!   The dancers, everything
Omg the opera in the beginning
I’m probably one of the few that loved her VMA performance & she killed this one too👏🏽👏🏽LOVE how versatile she is & leaves you wanting more🙌🏽Her star power is definitely ascending⬆️⬆️ & I am here for it💁🏽‍♀️⭐️💯
❤
She delivered!!!!!
Why does every performance have to seem like a sacrifice or seance in the beginning. It's not necessary 😕
This performance wasn't her style. She use to be more herself. A really classy young lady. Not all slutty  acting! Chloe incorporated everything 'Beyonce', who by the way doesn't dance at all, THIS slutty! Damn!! Chloe's own style was EPIC This performance isn't an original stance on her music. She's comes across, like a copycat.. A cookie cut out of Beyonce Knowles. Her own style was really awesone, if not better than Beyonce. Why was her own authenticity shunned?! Her performances look SO forced upon this BEAUTIFUL Angel.  #SexSells #BottomLine #MONEY
She did that🔥🔥🔥
Her performances are getting better. She is a fast learner.
I actually liked her first live performance of this song the best. This one was cool too though.
She look like she was getting possessed
LMBO amazing performance but why do I feel like she's TRYING to get the internet to make an illuminati video about her... That's just more publicity these days.
This queen ready to rule the world
PHENOMENAL..... GREAT COMPETITION FOR THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.
These chicks betta get a new wardrobe im bout sick of the glittered out bathing suits..and swimming on stage moves..really come on we've seen it! Already..
BEYONCE?
Why is nobody talking about this performance? She literally killed this
Murder Scene🔥🔥🔥
YASSSS QUEEN♡
Flawless
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Go Chloe girl 💯 been watching you since you were younger. Absolutely amazing how far you & your sis have come 🥰 Wow girl can move it 🔥 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Why keep bossing like she do?
Chloe Girl you're amazing i Love u
Chloe coming for that #1 Spot!!! Looking forward to her future Songs and Performances!! Well Done Nubian Queen!!
You betta do that shit girl!!!
Beyoncé is definitely her influence
First “Teach you a couple things” note was SICKENING
Amazing ❤️Had to watch it 4 times .. you did that yesssss hunni🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nothing but Beyonce here
Clöe
Go off then Chloe!!!🔥
Lawd…she wants somebody to put her fire out soooo bad 🙄🙄😬😑
Vindicated!!!💯💯💯❤️❤️❤️ That’s the face she made bitch!!!🥰🤣🥰
Chloe rocked it !
Chloe be serving Beyonce Vibes!!!!!. I know some of y'all will come here and be like"Chloe is Chloe not Beyonce" 🙄.... I said what I said and y'all must deal we can see Beyonce written all over this and it's beautiful
best performance of the night. SHE ATE DOWN.
So embarrassing. Alien dna demon. Ya’ll really can’t see? Zero spiritual discernment
Iconic beyond words
This was an amazing performance. I wished I saw more originality though. It’s screams Beyoncé. The outfit, the choreo, almost everything. Amazing performance, but Beyoncé is making Chloe a second version of her.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
these singers only talk about their asses.
Beyoncé has taught you well!! I am here for it all ❤️❤️🤩
Okay fuck it up friend!
Get it Chloe!
Essa performance ela entregou
Great performance but for me it was a little watered down compared to her other performances I think the Beyoncé comparances got to her but still is a force to be reckoned with she’s simply incredible
Cause she came to slay not play🤷🏽‍♀️
Yassssssss!!!! This was so much better!!  🔥🔥🙌🏾🙌🏾❤️❤️
She is beyond amazing and beautiful
What I don’t like how she’s working really hard on copying Beyoncé and not trying to be HERSELF
Fuck it up Ms. Bailey😝😝🥰👑💜
yeeees Girl!
SHE IS BAD TO THE BONE❤
She’s so talented!! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
When they first came out with the yt covers i predicted beyonce would make her own label and sign the sisters. I never predicted her taking this route, her intros was cringey to me. Her being so revealing and sexual is something I never thought would happen, I’m surprised beyonce is letting her go this route.
She did great for what it was but there was nothing original about it. Too Beyoncé-esk for me.
How can everyone not hear that she is a direct copy of Beyonce? We already had one. We don't need a direct copy.
Wow, her her performance kinda looks like Beyonce's
Yes ma’am
SHE FUCKIN DID THAT!!
She’s A Star, Ladies and Gentlemen 🌟
lil boring to me, she look like she was tryna remember the steps, plus it dont fit her
Cornball
They all show out on my soul
Shes the new Britney Spears
yeah...u did that
#1#LOVE LOVE#LOVE THIS ONE#LOVE IT
She got alot of money backing her...just made her into a star over nite
Love the growth! So much better than her MTV performance.
Girl u did that
She is bad ass! Amazing performer and singer!!
where's the other one?did she kill her?
When you took notes. got confidence posses talent UNDERSTOOD THE ASSIGNMENT AND DELIVERED TOP MARKS ON NEXT EXAM!! Reworking "video choreography" to fit "stage choreography" was A COMPLETE SUCCESS
Chloe honey I hope you taking heed to your comments darling they are noticing the change in you honey so keep this up! 😘
🙌🙌🔥🔥🔥Yooooh she possesses soooi much stage presence...👌 performance, just wow
Favorite performance 🤍♥️🖤
I love her but she needs to be herself not Beyoncé on the stage!
Breathing controls are amazing
On your way babygirl
Nice Illuminati ritual.
Britney spears should watch and learn from her..
She is like Beyoncé 😏
it's literally giving Bey vibes
2:42 can somone make an 1 hr video
Wait was she crying? I’d be crying too💜 you made it Chloe
You can tell Bey is her mentor love it
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Killed it 💫💥💫
I love love love it
Better than last time
Ok gurl
i will never understand this girl we alredy have one beyonce and she sings better and we have seen young beyonce too so find your own identity sorry for being rude but its annoying why do need a some version of beyone when we have the real beyonce
Yes this was great but let's not overlook  or ignore the signs of her invoking the spirit right before she hits the stage and don't say that I'm wrong but this is the same path that Beyonce took when she went solo the signs of her being possessed as Beyonce use to get are all over Chloe it doesn't mean it's a demon but whatever was taking over Beyonce when she would get ready to perform is with Chloe now if you lay attention to every other artist when they perform you could see that they just don't have that spirit with them trust me when I say it but soon she's gonna talk about an alter ego which I think she did as Beyonce did way back in interview with Oprah they bodies are being taken over by some type of spirit Normani performs good but u don't get the same thing from her as u do when Chloe perform and also Chloe is the only one that if u pay attention to her performancez she's the only one that u can see invoking something I can't explain it but if you know then u know
Goddess in the flesh 😍♥️
Keeps getting better everytime!
chole you ate it!
Go awwf!
Perfect
I feel like this was way more polished than her vma performance. She’s really excelling at her craft.
Lord forgive me for watching this crap
THAT WAS THE BEST PERFORMANCE THIS YEAR
Amazing!
An original
Una de las mejores presentaciones
Why does she remind me of Queen B... Can't wait to see more from Chloe ❤️
breathtaking
I see Beyoncé in her everytime she performs. Normani better ckme back already and have a collab with Chlöe.
What in the demonic entrance I just watch
She's THE MOMENT 🔥🔥🔥
Não resisto a essa batida 🙏
i love the fan cams, the energy in them is off the charts!! more bass, more crowd, more sound!! check out the fancams ya'lll
You can’t say that some of this choreography isn’t from Beyoncé’s Homecoming
She is perfecting her skills. She’s going to be a huge star.
Bey's first born
I really thought this young lady was classy… 👀NM
the dance breaks are everything
She's proven herself to be a force in the industry.  Let's appreciate and embrace her.
kween
Weird.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
so amazing
This is an incredible performance.🔥❤
That split. LORD Have Mercy.
Chloe I mean you coulda left some food for the rest of us hoes who ain't ate yet. I mean damn.
Well damn 🔥🔥🔥🔥
idk what yhe procedure is but i think im pregnant
Bts would've loved your performance💜💜 Beautiful vocals and performance❤❤❤❤
The NEXT BEYONCÉ💯💯
Very talented but beyonce agin cant do it
SHE SLAYS
BTS was watching this performance omg my boys ajajajjsh
beyonce
Definitely see the Beyoncé influence. She needs to keep that mic in the right hand only cause the queen never use the left hand for her mic EVER ! Lol
👀👀👀👀
Beyoncé everywhere in this
Excuse me Miss Ma'am, but you GAAAAAAVE🙌🏾🔥🔥😭
Queen Chloe 🤩
Perfeitaaa  aaah
These females still selling this sexual image? It’s played out smh
DO YALL HERE THEM LIL BACKROUND VOCALS AT 1:45
Glad she is responding  to the critique well. Took the queues to be less Beyonce clone, sharpen her dance moves, and do just enough to not channel  "try too hard/ do too much". As long as the lollipop videos are at a minimum, she will rise.
GIIRRRRLLL  I LOVET IT !!!!💗💗💗💗
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa meu Deus sou chloer
Want a new single 👍
*_Nữ Hoàng Của Mọi Người_*
*_Nữ Hoàng_*
Futura fodona do POP/R&B ♥️
truly a performer!
YASSS🔥🔥🔥
Her music arranger needs to be fired. The transitions aren’t clean at all. Chloe did great per usual though
This song isn't that great to be this "DRAMATIC". In fact it's just not a good song in general!!!!! Like I don't even listen to this song, but whenever I come across  it. I laugh so hard!!!! It's the disconnect between how she's sees herself, the performance, and her feeling this song, vs how her energy ain't matching with this song, lol. I don't even like Normani's song(forgot name). And I hate comparing them. They both have more and better potential, than a Beyonce could ever dream of. Then their giving.  But Normani's song(forgot name), had the energy that this song doesn't, to accomplish whatever Chole's trying and failing to push.   What are they doing. Chloe at this rate will be a subpar, cover of Beyonce's earlier career, if she was a female rapper. While Normani is again forgotten. They might as well proved with their talent. Then serving the expected, black Girl, sex = Grown woman and desirable, it doesn't . To still end up bottom trash, and looking stupid. SMH!!!!!
Every time I see this girl she convince me more and more that she sold her soul
braba q desgrama
OMG, Queen! 😍❤️
Okay it’s time to stop the Beyonce comparison this performance to me seemed like CHOLE not Beyonce ! She’s starting to come into her own ! She killed it . Now we just gotta latto stage presence to where choles is 😩
THICK
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA SIMPLESMENTE FENOMENAL!!!!!!!! QUE PERFEIÇÃOOOO!!!!!!!!
I hope she has strong songs written for future projects. She's a strong vocalist but song is a bit too gimmicky (in my opinion) and limits her.
uauu
I didn’t watch the vmas I haven’t for a while  I bet this was the best performance of that night
She is such a great performer! I cannot wait to see her in concert one day. She'll be worth the money.
Lord Have Mercy Chloe kilt this Performance!!! She ATE and LEFT NO 🍞 CRUMBS! Her red lockes was everything🥰🥰🥰🥵 And her breathe control is everything Wow!
I’ve been trying to keep the song out of my head, it’s sooooo hard😩
A mamaãe Queen B  fez o trabalho dela certinho
Couple more runs on the treadmill with vocals & it's OVA 🗣️‼️‼️‼️ Big Improvement...She been workingggg👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Have mercy on me Chole 😩🥵🔥🔥😘❤️❤️❤️.. That was a great performance,I love you ❤️🤗
Copiaaa da Beyoncé, Falta ORIGINALIDADE!
Sensacional
Lets be honest. Sis is an amazing singer and I like that but I feel like she was cutting the words of her songs and she only sang about five words in total and I praising you sis but you was focused more on the dancing than the completing your sentences xoxo
Hello. 👋🏼 Jesus is coming back soon, 🕊I wanted to tell you to find God, 🙏🏼 before it’s too late.
Staaaaaaaaar
Much better performance.
That’s how you a clear a bitch 🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
I love her voice
i don’t know who is her but the best performance 🔥🔥🔥
Superb!
We're loving the red locs
Perfect
Her dance break tough😍😍😍🤞🤞🤞✨✨
Wow this performance was pure perfection
what are her and the dancers chanting at the end???
amazing performance everything was on point!
Anyone noticed the watery eyes and tear she wiped off in the beginning??
Get it girl👏🏾
Whoever is behind the creativity for this lady's performances deserves a lot of dollars 💵
she is so pretty<3
AMAZING CHLOEEEE
You were AH-Mazing, babe!
🗑
ALWAYS EATS
New Beyonce
Chloe absolutely killed it, she switches up her routine and the way she sings her lyrics everytime she performs it and it keeps getting better and better!  I see 👀 ya Chloe! 🔥🔥🔥
😍😍😌
Be low on gas and deo and soap and food and air freshener or stop paying tv to make fun of me for being nosey to stars.
THIS WAS A CLEAR CLEAN PERFORMANCE OF THE SONG AND IT WAS 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just wonderful ... teach meh ;)
How many times I've watched this?....about 100 times😂😂😂😂
Serving bawdy
I love how every performance of this song is completely different!!!!!
Cara já sou muito cadelinha. O pop precisa dela
OMG  beautiful 😍
She's elevating every performance. Taking notes, studying, and  understanding all the assignments.👌💥💯
💖💖💖
Sem dúvidas a melhor performance da noite 🖤✨
Sis is really following the Bey blueprint I luv it every sec of it! U have to perform & perform like it's the last time u goin touch a stage that's why she's 1 of the best to ever do it! Chloe' goin be 1 of the greats too long as she stay focused
RITUAL FULFILLED.
Wow Insane
Los mas felices de esta presentacion fueron los bts 😎
ARMYs should have noticed something familiar in Chloe's final move.💜  Wonderful, Chloe.  Spectacular performance.🥰
This is so Beyonce..
something about the energy is off
Tava com preguiça de dança e cantar?
Sounds kinda Beyonce-ish... Doesn't she?
رجعو ولداتنه لكوريا 😍💔..
I would be ded. Rutted and gutted I would be so out of breath she did amazinggggg 🥳🥇
Bts see this :👁👄👁
Terrible forgettable and boring … 🥱😴…..😂😂😂😂 She was definitely STIFF. She not really about THAT Life! 😴
👸🏾
Not impressed.
By far her best performance, no one is touching her. one song and she is like this? Queen shit ♥️♥️♥️🔥
Amazing!
BIG, and im not talking about her booty 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Chloe and Namjoon …. I want to see that happen 💜😄
💖
Why did it look like she was crying though, well she had tears on her face, noone saw that?😭😭
Esta mujer es la mejor moviendo el botyyyyy
Stop using the Beyonce formula; find your own path.
This would have been my pregame jam back in the day. Reminds me of fun times.
God 🛐
The next Beyonce
First glance: is that Queen B? Looks further: Chloe? Damn she good
Now this is a CHLOE PRODUCTION
um lacre
Arrasa muito essa menina
Beyonce deve tá muito orgulhosa ❤️❤️❤️
posta em full hd mulher
Chloe have Mercy on us ma'am ❤️😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥I love to see your growth and continuous growth despite some of the harsh comments about your sexuality. I say keep your Head up so your crown doesn't fall, it's your journey and I'm here all the way for it. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️Love you Chloe all the way from South Africa 🇿🇦
She's a hell of a performer, I love her stage presence🔥🔥
I am extremely proud Chlöe!!!
I must be old because this sound like crape to me!
Perfeita meu amor
Ai q delícia de performance
I think she forgot the jump in the last dance break but it’s still so smoothh
mulher, tu serviu muito
She is good. I specially like her vocals.
Young lady has ample thighs.
💜
SHE nailed it
Iconica e incrivel como sempre
HER SERVE
Um super like diretamente do Brasil!
This is her bootylicious era. Beyonce had hers and now she having one too. You couldn’t pay Beyonce to perform that song now.
Damn Her Live Is Better ! TBH. She sounds like Beyonce and Ariana at the same time woooahhh.  This is my first time to watch Chloe and now i'm falling 😍
Why are WE THE ONLY group of people who have to be half naked, pants hanging off cursing and talking about how to use our body parts to sell music? No other group dose this. Then blk woman want to be respected by blk men but look at how you carry yourself. And this young adult is probably still a virgin and talking about her Laffy taffy, and it ppl twice her age thinking it's cute. This is another problem our community has normalizing premarital sex and violence. Others sing about love and happiness fully dressed without violence and cursing and still make money. Our ppl are creative don't get me wrong, but it always ends up being negative. Until we do better as BLACK people and change our mind set this is all we will have in the future is a bunch of used bodies.
QUEEN
Chloë got me 💙
Underwood the assignments
Yes Chloe you ate that shit up! Girl you slayed so hard I am officially a Chloe Stan! I noticed that Beyoncé signature move from Baby boy! Love every minute of this! 😩🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
Best of the night. Period!
Best best performance
Amazing!!!
She looks a little bit like beyonce in this performance
now *thats* a Body! lawd #havemercy
Why didn't they give her playback for those quite parts??
She is amazing. Your future is bright chloeeee
😍😍😍😍
this performance is not much different from the VMAs but her vocals are always good...
Ela soa como Beyoncé e Ivete Sangalo, vixe
la choré est top!! et beaucoup mieux maitrisée que lors de ses précédentes perf!
One thing I hate about award show performances is the crowd is always so fucking dry and just horrible no matter who performs award show crowds always have that stale 'I dont wanna see them" attitude.
Too much Beyonce in this performance. She literally replicated some of Beyonce's moves
2:42 slayyy
Amazing song, outstanding choreography, great singing, awesome performer = THE BEST PERFORMANCE! Congratulations Chloë!
Que talento❤🇧🇷
It’s the energy for me
It takes another level of skill to be able to sing, and I mean really sing a song while doing choreography but Chloë makes it seem easy 😂❤️
I really need an album she's so talented 😭
I really love how she is able to blend vocals with her rap, there are very few people that can do that...
Kill't it!!!
Me remembering BTS was there 😉
Beyonce vibe?
O orgulho da Beyoncé, brilha mais Chlöe sua linda
I am so proud of her🥺💜 it brings tears to my eyes that she's living out her dream 💜💜💜💜
Omg. I am ARMY. I Watched AMAs . I saw Chloe, too. I shoked her voice and talent......Now I cheer her music...❤👍👍
The DRAMA.
ELA É O MOMENTO, E NÃO TEM PIEDADE NENHUMA COM A GENTE  AMO
Yesssss!!! Now THIS is it!! So much improvement from the VMA's! 🧡🧡🧡🧡
Wow the performance is very good
this gives me the same feelings as lizzo bringing out a flute.
Chloe is the new diva 💃 🩰 🕺 she is so extra i am LIVING EVERY PERFORMANCE! this takes the cake
Beyoncé, it’s u ?! 😳 no need second Be ….
Sexy performance 💯👏👏 bravo Chloé
I feel like she listened to the critique and has improved DRASTICALLY. This is amazing!
I'm so blown away yallll 😩😩😩🤸🤸🤸🤸, this is an excellent performance
When the cheer began!! I screamed!!!
😮‍💨
My sister asked if this was from an old concert of Beyonces. I have to admit, had I not known who it was I would say it was Beyonce. Wasn't that special.
Why am i crying…
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
This is one of the best performances in the last decade or so. Everyone else(except Doha Cat) has been very stale and boring to watch .Apart from actual singers, most of the new performers do not know how to sing nor give a show and Chloe has just done that! Very proud of this performance and she is going to get to the top very soon. Congratulations  Chloe.🎊🍾🎈
Serving bawdy
Yess Queeen!!! 😭😭😭 Goldddd, performance was epiccc ahhhh thiccc 😍😍
I loved this performance!! Although I was watching it on TV and wasn’t there, it was a great experience :)
I can't fucking lie this chick is fly as fuck
I trust I agree I believe and I receive i decree and declare by fire and by force in the mighty name of jesus thank you and amen and amen and amen
Personally i still love the VMAs performance, but this was great as well and more polished. Good work Chloe!
This performance was *chefs kiss* WOW CHLOBEAR 😍😍😍😍
Her voice is😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
❤️❤️❤️
Nice one. We're a music production team - it would be great if you could check our tunes as well. Respect
QUEEN
i thought she was the next Beyonce but apparently she cannot even sing her own song live well so No. There’s still no next Beyonce lmao
She toned it down a lil huh
Perfeitaaaaaaa
I'm old school and this beautiful lady performance was amazing.!
Witchcraft
Um luxo!!!
It's the end of a thing that matters. I pray you have a good end. For there's a way which seems right, but the end is death. You may think you're threading a good path but at the end you'll realise if it was s good or wrong path. Just hoping it might not be too late Chloe. You may love God and music, but you gotta put GOD first. God created music. One of the ways we worship Him is through music however, you gotta put God in front of your Melody. If you claim you love Him ask yourself, "does your Melody Glorify Him"?
fucken beautifulllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
like there's anything new here
superior en todos los sentidos, que bien se sintió ver esto en vivo
Im so obssesed with this..i cant stop watching this esp the dancebreak at the end😭
You snapped!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Liberal 🤡 - Real Life Title
I love her confidence and at the end she was like yep I ate that sh** up black girl magic  🎩 👩🏾
A certain nobody (cough*Normani*cough) was ended.
those hips never is superstars work out.
The Bible prophecies that one day without the mark ( in hand or forehead) you cannot buy or sell.  Does this seem similar to anything going on now? Will you believe in Jesus Christ when you see with your eyes this prophesy come to pass?
Wake up, Jesus is coming soon!  Repent and believe the gospel:  Christ died for your sins, was buried, and rose again the third day, according to the scriptures.  He is the only way to Heaven.  He alone can save you from your sins and eternal torment in hell!  He loves you and doesn't wish that any should perish.  Time is running out; please believe on Jesus.
Im in love............... She is crazy talanted.. listening  her since 2012.......... Chlöe 🔥
🥰🥰🥰
she looks great
Chole! Chole! Chole! Thats all I can say. You done left me speechless Lawd Have Mercy.

https://youtu.be/-AaOr_g8nlQ
This reminds me of Beyonce Coachella
Now I felt that
It's giving Porgy & Bess intro
Okay, Beyonce Jr. We see you! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
UMA PERFORMANCE MELHOR QUE A OUTRA,DE FATO A MÚSICA É DIGNA DEMAIS,AMO! ♡🗣
TUDOOOOO
Ela se entrega como a mãe dela
chloe ilysm
MY GIRL ATE IT ALL UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I liked this a whole lot, I haven’t been the biggest fan of the “oversexualizing and the licking the mic” but this is hard work, this was subtle but yet tasteful and she still kept with the theme of the song without doing overly to much this was very good. My mom always told me less is more sometimes and in her case I like this 🥰
i love this song and she killed this performance!
🔥
Pura arte e entrega
excellent performance from Chloe
Why does it seem that most stars are using the red/cult type aesthetic? It's very played out lately...
Yasss🔥🔥🔥
This was super polished. She wasnt over humping the ground. It was about the performance. We love you Chlo!!
This bish copied Nick minaj performance 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Huge improvement from her first performance of this song. You can tell she is working hard.
Now if anybody come on here to say she doing too much, watch yourself cz i know where you live👿👿
HER OUTFIT HER HAIR HER PERFORMANCE WAS EVERYTHING
The intro looks cultish as if they are worshiping a fallen Angel
I became her fan when I watched her awesome performance in the AMAs and I'm so happy to know that she's also a fan of BTS!! ARMY loves you Chloe!!
🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺 Warning‼️ Judgement is coming! The sins of the people have been very great , the land is full of bloodshed and full of perversity. The Lord will recompense their deeds on their own heads. Let at the people tremble for the day of the Lord is coming, a day of darkness and gloominess.   Anoint your eyes with eye salve that you may see— repent of your lack of faith and spiritual understanding!  Come out from under Babylonia so that you will not be partakes of her sins. Separate yourselves because judgement is coming!!  REPENT‼️ For the kingdom of God is at hand.   Those who are sealed with the Lords name will be spared. He does not wish for anyone to perish. Repent and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. The Lord has no pleasure in death. For why will you die? Turn yourselves and live!!!   Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.” ‭‭John‬ ‭14:6‬ ‭NKJV‬‬  “Blow the trumpet in Zion, Consecrate a fast, Call a sacred assembly; Gather the people, Sanctify the congregation, Assemble the elders, Gather the children and nursing babes; Let the bridegroom go out from his chamber, And the bride from her dressing room. Let the priests, who minister to the Lord, Weep between the porch and the altar; Let them say, “Spare Your people, O Lord, And do not give Your heritage to reproach, That the nations should rule over them. Why should they say among the peoples, ‘Where is their God?’ ” Then the Lord will be zealous for His land, And pity His people.” ‭‭Joel‬ ‭2:15-18‬ ‭NKJV‬‬ 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨
CAMERA angles why are you not giving this performance the justice it deserves. Wide vs Close Ups?
Gorgeous
This is LIVEEEEEE
Jesus Christ is coming back soon! please take it serious what he spoken of is coming to pass right before our eyes.. it’s not a joke,so  y’all need to know the saving salvation of ur soul..that is in Jesus Christ who bore our sins He’s the way the truth and the life He brutality died on the cross to pay the penalty for all of our sins so that if you acknowledge you’re a sinner that’s sinned against His law and you turn to Him by confessing with your mouth that Jesus Lord and believe that he was raised from the dead and call upon his name and repent of ur sins you would be forgiven and saved spared from damnation and Heaven bound God bless you❤️
Maravilhosaaaaa Mamãe Beyonce deve estar orgulhosa 

This was her best performance yet! Great

This performance was perfect. Nobody can say that she “did too much” this time.
I was NEVER READY FOR THIS PERFORMANCE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yassss
Great job! Mama Bey has taught her well, but my gut tells me this is not who she really is as a Professional singer. However, in order to keep up in today's young pop culture, this type of performance is influenced. Beyonce knows this.
A collab with Normani would be amazing!
This performance was everything you go chole😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️
She went HARDER on the choreography for this performance 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Love this performance I pray she come with big hits in years to come
Loved this performance! You can see chloe essence here
OKAY POISON IVYYYYYYYYYYYY
Not the motivation dance break moves at the end 😭😭 plus the added fact her dancers were doing the infamous loves lies BMA performance moves as well 😭😭
Okkkk Chloe 🙌🏽😍🔥
Ten!
she’s so theatrical I LOVE ITTTT
Yesss Giiirrlll just like that right there ! I knew there wouldn't be any disappointment I like ever version of this song she has performed so far. Just switching it up and adding new things it's  greatness and hard work u can tell.
yassssssss she killed it ☺️💛
Be careful of not borrowing too much from Beyonce. I already see you borrowing her clothes from Black is King.  Could be a more interesting dancer. More alive, more spark. But we can only do so much. Twerking and crotches flying through the air doesn’t really impress me anymore. Would have been nice to hear a new song at this time too.I know I’m coming off harsh but that’s what my eyes are seeing and perceiving. I’m kind of strict.
Beyonce been real quiet since this performance okurrrrrr lmao
Ela entrega tudo ❤️
Such a Diety
The whole thing felt like I was watching beyonce❤
I just came to see the BTS reaction from different angles and still can't see their face I'm having a mental breakdown from this!!!🤣🤣🤣
"👁️"
pisa em mim chloe, arrasou mt
So far this my favorite performance. She did really good.
noice!
Great performance
No hate but she was summoning some shit, her eyes were all the way in da back of her head when she was on the swing. 🥴
Ladies and Gentlemen CHLOE 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
But is she gonna have another song soon or …
No, just no
Uhhhm yes. That’s definitely it!
Her dancing get mad better ever time 🤩
It reminds me of nicki performance with little mix hehe, and I just love chloe killing it.
Definitely Beyonce feels but definitely her own sound
She is super thick good gosh !!
Can you guess this song? New video uploaded weekly! https://youtu.be/owOXdobF-Ls
SENHOR JESUS PAI ETERNO
Chloe took all that everyone said about the VMA performance and perfected it. Daaaamn 🔥! This was so flawless... so well put together.... kind of calm and can we talk about that choir sounding so angelic while singing about big boorrraaaays 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I forgot to mention the Opera in the beginning!!!! It gave me chills
Killer body ❤️‍🔥🔥🔥🔥😍
SHE ATE
OK Chloe!!! I most definitely see the improvement much more precise and controlled! She's coming!
honestly never seen a live performance from her before but i love her stage presence
Sound was off
Esse espaço é seu!
Every time she perform this song i get a new favorite version of it. I am so proud of Chloe she tore that mf stage up. I noticed she been working on her control all her moves was clean and I can tell she took the criticism from comments and worked on it. Awesome performance and that Red is Everythang!
Chloe is already a legend. The amount of control you have with your vocals and performance is unmatched for a “new artist” or even artists your age.   With other performers, sometimes their dance compensates for their voice but you knocked me out on BOTH
A PERFORMANCE.
Girl, you should have uploaded this earlier because I watch their performance about TEN times already on other channels 🥲 You could have got my views
Chloe had the right amount of energy, precision, excitement, and attitude. Beautiful performance
I miss when the camera used to catch audience reactions. Because this performance definitely blew people out the water!
She's not doing too much Y'all just having lower standard
❤️
all jaws on the floor rn
Okk this what I like!
She ended that performance like “ what else do y’all want from me” I love it
Yaaay!!! Chlöe.
ALL I CAN SAY IS YASSSSSSSS !!!!!! I’m sitting here at the plasma center bout to fall out my seat dancing with sis 🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😅😅😅😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️💎💎💎💎 Bossing,Flossing,Saucing,Costing
I just screaming like a proud Mama!!! Get it baby!!!!
YASSSSSSS CHOLE, YOU DELIVERED SIS!!!!!!! 🥰😭😍😍😍😍😍
Yes ma’am 👏🏽
Nice moves chloe, I Love everything about this performance.
I really do appreciate your performance and I love it very very much . And just like what you have been performed at VMA was really hit me badly 😩❤️ ily 🤟
oh damn just damn.
It was an alright preformace.
I've replayed this so many times!   @ChloeBailey, what are all the names of your dancers please?  They also did amazingly! Are they also the ones doing the cheer during the stepping? #ChloeAMAs
BTS in the public : 👀👀👀
This was better than the first show!! Still look like Beyonce,.wish you would sing a little bit more. Such a pretty voice
This was amazing!
Yes ma'am
Best performance of the night. Chloe is a top tier performer and she just keeps getting better
You did great Si👑💜
Chloe is thick thick
She came through hard! This was quite a performance!
Queen B's vibes🤩
DAMNNNNNN
Have mercy 😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘
She killed it!
I seriously love your attitude 🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️ It's Fire😘😘
MDSS ELA É PREFEITAAAA
She did a great job. I can tell she was a bit nervous but I have no doubt that she’ll grow and develop more in the future. I have nothing but high hopes for Ms. Chlöe.
That Good's
Best remix
She ate this performance up!!!!! Yaaaasssss Chole!!!!! She just gets better and better!!!!!
She ate and left no crumbs
I love the suck it move at the end. That was for all these joes that keep coming for her. Okaaaay Ms. Chloe girl. I see you.
Chloe always knows how to put on a performance and really never disappoints
The improvements and confidence ❤❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
She slayed this. This is one of the best performances she has ever done. She is really a force to be reckoned with.
FLAWLESS! <3
CARALHOOOOOOOO, MISERICÓRDIA 😭😭
The dancing is better. Keep that choreographer.
PERIOD
YOU WERE ANGRY!!!
Chloe is the perfect embodiment of a Cancer. I know y’all see my girl tearing up. 😂❤️
Smashed it! Love her. Keep making us all so PROUD! The world loves you 🔥
Icon
Sis killed it 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
I love that she wasnt as experimental with the vocals this time, since she sounds sooooo good! Everything was so on point, so happy to finally hear her beautiful vocals without any of those inflictions from those previous performances (they weren’t bad at all, but i just wanted a performance where she sounded more like the track to see her amazing live potential 💕)
I've never clicked so fast on a video! Chloe gurrrlll! We don't deserve you. Lawd have mercy👌🏿❤️
My girl!!
Dude that was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Go on your voice is powerful and love your red locks 💖💖❤️❤️
Wow. this girl is just an amazing performer https://youtu.be/UkQ-OpMe-Ek
BREATH CONTROL!!!! 🙌🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Cute
Vocals check Dance check Performance wow
Baby so proud of you ♥ ♥ ♥
Shes not a queen   SHES A GODDESS
Ja neh... she made it  She is one of them now
The backup dancers were so amazing but could have giving them a better bodysuit bc while they were dancing their black panties is slightly showing through the leggings. But overall the whole performance was so amazing.  Love the stage presence.  Chloe did so great.
When I saw she was crying I was balling my eyes out I felt the energy
‼️EXCELLENT ‼️Yes! This is what we want from you girl!
🏔GOOSEBUMPS 🌋 You look 👀 AMAZING 🤩 AMAZING 😻 CHLOE‼️
Beyonce's 2nd version.
OH LORD HAVE MERCY
The creativity gives me Doja Cat vibes
Her best performance of this song so far. A PERFORMER
best performance from "have mercy" era! ✨✨
She’s giving us what we’ve been missing and so much more. 😍
BOUNCE IT TO THE LEFT LEFT, BOUNCE IT ON THE RIGHT RIGHT‼️
She is Janet Jackson level talent and then some, she will reign
His vocal 🔥✨✨
Beyoncé part 2
This was so so beautiful 😍 my baby maturing like fine wine 🍷
Now i know why jhope breaking his neck for😁
Chloe is coming for the grammy
Actually they tell you when to applause y’all was searching for more😭😂😅
What was y’all waiting for to applause, more; are y’all crazy😢😢😢😢
She ain’t here to play she here to serve
Chloe you really did that! The mic was ON, the choreography was fantastic, Breath control 10/10! It's only up for you 🙌🏾🙌🏾
❤️🔥
This was a really good step from her usual a little too mcuh energy but she looked a little to underwhelmed. Just a little more energy’s chole
Wow speechless. That was great
This red hair fits her personality!
Omg. She's iconic
the fact that this queen is my age and slaying!!!! I could never :(
A melhor que nós temos!!
Beyonce rihanna nicki  Used to be the biggest names  presenting the black diva image around the world.  Now chloe is with the team.
White people always clap on the wrong beat
Yazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz     Have mercy 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
AMAZING ❤️🕺🏾
She ate that mf stage up
The backup dancer doing the splits did so good😭😭👍👍
good JOB
I loved this performance better than the VMAs. The overall performance was better and loved the dance break!
Okay i now see it....2:13 and 2:24 ...hearing it without watching it will make you think it's Beyonce singing This girl is out of this world🔥🔥😍
I know you full Chlöe because you ATE this No. ; Lord have mercy!
AMAZING!!
I can’t get enough of this song and I think she’s sooo talented, but I do think it’s a shame that’s she’s now another artist who’s having to go down this route to gain more of an interest for themselves. Her music with Halle was so unique, so raw. THIS, it’s just sex, sex, sex. She’s so much better than what she’s doing.
They better STOP sleeping on this girl. Her songs need to chart where they should be because she is giving. Btw Chloe, Hallie and Normani - STOP sleeping on them girls and let the queens take their spots
Mama can perform and I'm here for it😍😍😍😍🔥
Yes Chloe Bailey❤️❤️❤️
How to be this woman fr
Good Job!! Love the Red Locks!!
Now hunny , that’s a performance!!
All the girls curvvvyyy❤❤❤
LEGENDARY 🔥🔥👍👍👍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I could watch that walk for the rest of my life if was so good
goddess!!!
you killed it
Yes Red Locs...let us know Ariel is coming.
Didn't Bey put her on? Yep she the right one 🪄💃🏾💞
If she puts God first as she said. Then He would shown her this wasn't pleasing into Him. Ijs
That was 🔥🔥🔥🔥
wow the breakdance is all
The fact that the way in which she performs the song and the song itself changes everytime IS AMAZING AND SOOOOOOOOOOOOO INSPIRING - I wish I could perform my music one day! 😆 💕 👑
She has a wonderful voice 🖤
Perfeitaaaaaaaa, maravilhosa, a patroaaaaa
This was amazing Chlöe!!!
She ate that! 🔥
Amazing..... chloe is the best for performance 2021 !!!
You delivered, ate and left no crumbs and I love how at the end you basically told the haters to "suck it" with that move
Yeeeesss! She performed tf out of this song! They did that! 🔥
Beautiful beautiful
You , Normani & Doja Cat cat are such great performers i hope to see you guys collab one day
If you were wondering if it would ever be another Beyoncé????? Boom there she is #findthelie
SHES SO STABLE WOWWW
idk its kind of a disappointment she barley sung and i shouldn't be able to know ans sing her lyrics  for a longer period
Academy award
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥SHE CAME AND SHOWED OUTTTTT!!! GO HEAD BOO🙌🏾
2:43 till the end is my fav

OMG
Soft porn yet again. Yawn. 🥱 I admire the singing and dancing at the same time without getting winded 👏
Well…that was definitely in the pocket 🧐
You're a ducking QUEEN
I'm a stan! man!!
❤️
Chloe im super proud of you ! The more you perform the better you are !
😍
So much more refined! Excellent performance
I wanna see bts reaction 😂
Amazing! ❤️🙏🏽
Yes she sounds like Beyoncé God Said These  Ppl Need To Leave We Got To Go Before The San Andreas Fault-line Split/ Seperate Not Enough Sewers and Might Happen After Dark...Queen Of The Damned Too "The San Andreas  Fault-line Curse"
Con todo respeto para los artistas que se presentaron en esta premiación pero BTS y CHLOE tuvieron las mejores las presentaciones
Been waiting for this to drop 🤍🤍
Beyhive approved 10000x
50 seconds in and she ATE already, didn't even open her mouth yet!
Not a fan of the song or of the performances of it (the phrase "aggressively mediocre" applies), but I am extremely happy that she is finally getting the attention that she and her sister have looooong deserved.
Was she crying the whole time?? I wonder what was happening with her that night… when I watch her AMA interviews she was giving off vibes like she’s had a rough week… hope everything is good in the hood, love you Chloe!!
DEU O CARAI! A MULÉ TIRA A BRABA HAHAH
Beautiful
I LOVED IT!!! GURL SHOW EM!!! WHICH YOU DON'T HAVE PROVE ANYTHING EXCEPT TO GOD!!! UR AMAZING AND IVE BEEN FOLLOWING YOU SINCE DAY ONE!! DONT LET THEM TARE YOU DOWN OR MAKE U INTO SOMETHING YOUR NOT!

i want her to ruin my life
I'm in love with this woman 😍😍😍😍
Yo this was better then her vmas performance i knew she get better as time went on like her choreo on point the entrance on point vocals on point i cant wait to see where she performs this next hopefully the soul train awards and the grammys
ICONIC
Great voice! Great song! Great dancer! But it’s like to see Beyoncé! A biggest singer without personality! I would like to know Chloe and I’m waiting for it! ☺️
c'mon steppinggggggg!
Beyoncé reincarnated
Vocals and choreo on 1000⚡ too infinity and beyond 😁
This was amazingggg. Love how she is coming into her own ❤️❤️
Queeeeeeen
Give us everything Queen
Chlöe! You did THAT!!!!💯 #HaveMercyBaby💜
YAAAAAAAAAS
Beyonce's Child!!!!!!!!
You did amazing Chloe 💗 can't wait to see how you continue to grow as an artist ☺️
This is soooooo Beyonce
Amazing performance! She didn’t have to do all the extra or be all extra. I think she took notes from what her fans have been saying. And it shows. Great performance!
the performance was great but am I the only one who thinks she looked kinda...not happy? is that just a look she has? Maybe she was just tired from performing? I'm new to Chloe so i dunno
The way my girl Chloe ate this performance up. Best performance of the night without a doubt. This was even better than the VMA performance which she killed.
Best performance of have mercy yet.
The attitude i felt it throw the screen yaaasss miss ma'am
Mercy
Go Chloe go!!!
I looooooove that she always changes her performances ✨ 😌 she is amazing and I love the red locs😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 she toned down the performance from her MTV awards one I miss the extra-ness lol but still love it ! You go chloe 👏🏾 ❤
why I do feel Chloe performance is often cringy? Oversexualized and her vocal and dance performance is too reminding of Beyonce's style. Also, this is obviously pre-recorded.
Wowwwwww
y'all she got it down PACT on her THIRD performance in 2 months. It takes artists  YEARS. lol let that sink in. She is lethal.
💯💯💯❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Way better then that tv performance
Muito filha da Beyoncé!!!
iconic
That’s got Beyoncé written all over it and I love it
Casi igual q la presentación que hizo nicki minaj en 2018 en los mtv vma
She sounds like Beyoncé
She IS the moment! Period
She is so damn amazing 😩👌 No wonder hyung line couldn't take their eyes off her.
Wait!!!! How about the winners?
Dona da porra toda ❤️
Every performance is better than the last. Keep it up girl 💕
Único respiro dessa premiação
👏👏👏I see the improvement. Go Chloé!!!
Period. She did that 👌🏾👏🏾

Normani home crying .  gurrrlll Stop lip singing  chloe is the Queen
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
Yes Queen Chloe work 💅💅💅
Another day Another Slay....
Beginning sounds demonic to me. But whatever. Carry on... Great performance not crazy about this song tho. .
Get it!!!!!! Love💗💗💗💗💗
Omg was that Lizzo that screamed “YASSSSSSS” when she hit the split????
Wow just amazing!!
Why was she crying? I just noticed
Top notch performance and beautiful singing voice and I love your dance moves and I love your outfit and gorgeous hair 💖💖💖💖💋💯💗💗
her presence is amazing!!!!
that mic was on!
This was excellent, Chlöe 😚🙈🤍🤍🤍
This Performance was Amazing!! She Nailed it 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 I can't Wait For her Next Single!!
I love that every performance is different and Chloe fuc*in murders every performance
BTS WATCHING THIS 👀
Lord have mercy on you girl 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amazing
Why do humans give away all their power to ritualistic events? Chloe is a great artist she doesn't need to "bow" to any lou cipher to show her skills...but then again...they won't even let anyone perform now a days with an "ode to ye ole' horned one"!!! One day I hope Chloe doesn't have to do these paganistic performances for these coven and sorcerers- its really getting played out frfr!!
She ate that tf up
All I have to say is “I’m Proud”💜
I was not able to see her performance but damn! She's amazing! 😍 I was curious because she was so sweet and supportive to BTS. 🥺 Hope to see more of her performance. Definitely added to my streaming playlist 😘
1:49 🙌🏿
She's holy sheyt Beyonce today ❤️
Best performance to date
$jahqueezy05 its my birthday monday ill be turning 16
I love Chloe and her performance but tbh I feel like she was holding back a lot in this one . It didn’t give what the other two performances she did gave . But idk maybe that was intentional.
She is incredibly talented😍
not her best performance, and it's not a bad performance either.
Kadang kalo nonton live performance artis lain kadang cuma nikmatin aksi panggung sama dance doang kalo vokal gak terlalu suka. Tapi beda banget sama chloe, walau nyanyi nya sedikit putus2 tapi enak banget dengerin vokalnya.
You deserve every bit of recognition coming your way. Legend in the making
@chloe you did the damn thang once again with this beautiful song. Your on to a long & prosperous career in this music. You are definitely gonna get your E.G.O.T.
Normani should’ve performed to but the industry is all about light skin it’s sad
Yes Chloe! Perfection ✨
YOU ATE THIS UPPPP!!!
Loved it so damn much. The best one yet  Can’t wait for the future songs to slay me this hard
One of the best I seen last night
Flakaaaa te amoo muchooo
I don't really like her don't know why, but i admit she is really good, she knows how to do her thing, i enjoy this performance too much.
😍😍😍💖💖
Her VMAS were the best because she gave vocals and energy but I love this as well. Chloe x halle never seems to fail
already a star.
WE LOVE A BLACK QUEEN 👸🏽
🔥 🔥🔥
stole the show 💗
She Murdered This!!!!!🤩🔥❤️🔥🤩
Chloë, you've grown so much as a performer in the last few months. I'm so proud of you!!
I 💘_u Chloe😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😊😊😊😊☺☺😳😳😳😄😙😜😝😝😝🐍🐱🐍🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅📹🐴🐴🐴😂👅👅👀💦👄✌✌✌

Love the balance of the one
and she did this singing LIVE! there are very few people who are doing it like her. she's incredible
You go Chloe do you boo great job!! <3
Look how she ate that *again*
You keep getting better and better Chloe. By far my favorite of your solo performances so far. We need more of those beautiful vocals 😍
I wish people understood that it’s not her trying to be Beyoncé, it’s the industry and that “Sasha fierce spirit,” influencing her to transform into this generations Beyoncé. She’s not doing it on purpose.
I would really like to know more about her loctitian her & Halle's "locs" are always so pretty - I didn't know "locks" in general could look so good & styled with such versatility <3
🎹✨🌹💣
AMAZINGGG
such a great performance!!! props for the dancers, they were so gorgeous and talented 👏👏👏
Great performance! And damn such a beautiful voice even live 💜
Amazing performance 🔥🔥🔥
My girl Delivered,Served,Ate and left no crumbs😍😍😍

2:35 I can ’t this part is very addictive, girl you did so well🤍!!!

Chloe took notes, studied, and killed it!
You can see the confidence and energy she puts into her choreograph. She stays in character throughout the whole performance and hits every move seamlessly.
She ate and left no crumbs 🍽️🍽️🍽️🍽️🍽️💥💥💥💥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Rent was due and she overpaid it
Number 1 at this moment in time. Great stuff and confidence.
YOU SERVEDDDD
What new gworl is coming out the gate performing like this at their second award show performance? The vocals, stage presence, stamina, charisma, and choreo were all there & my sister delivered a polished performance with the energy leveled out throughout the entire thing. The girls gon learn to stop playing with Chlöe period cause she’s NOT one of them!! Anyways Grammy’s us NEXT please, 2022 is Chlöe’s year!! 💖🐍☘️
Amazing performance! I really hope her next single will let her show out her amazing vocals more ❤️

THE QUEEN 🔥
Chloe is just giving us a whole cinematic performance every time
Idk i like her but i prefer she be herself and not Beyoncé
You're over here picking up where Beyonce left off, and I'm here for it.
Gente, a Chloe é muito boa, mas parece que não tem controle na respiração. Igual a Olívia, tem muito o que aprender. Ela está num nível onde não se deve apenas julgar só justificar. Espero q melhore durante o tempo.
✨QUEEEEENNNNNNN✨😩😩😩😩💜
Black excellence in person i love you so much my chlöe sending ❤️❤️❤️❤️ from Algeria north Africa Arabian fan
YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS UPLOAD
By far her best performance of this song yet she’s trying her best on stage and you can feel it, in a few years she’s gonna be unstoppable

Chloe!! Hey queen! Girl you have done it again. Constantly raising the bar with each performance and doing it flawlessly. I am so proud of you. It is a joy watching you blossom into the star you are ✨✨✨
Every time I see Chloe perform, I just want the album to drop so we get a longer set, she pours so much energy into each performance, Brava Chloe! Love the red locs! 😍❤️ 🎭✨
That dance break had me hollering! It's great to watch Chloe's evolution as an artist 😊

Chloe is fast establishing herself as a solo artist that do her ting both solo and with her sister irrespective of what others may think about her continuous development.
This isn’t that good. You can definitely tell auto tune was used a lot in the actual music vid.  Dancing is fire tho.
The choreo/step routine EXUDES Black Excellence. She is a beacon of Black Excellence🤎✊🏾
