Chris E-MTB the whole Nakasendo would be cool….
Amazing video ❤
Comercial videos are too long before watching this youtube video. I closed it before watching.
12:00 I doubt the bear would have any compunction about eating you. They don’t mess around.
I'm heading there next March and can't wait ! I would love to know the name of the second traditional house you stayed in though, I could only see the first one listed
I had a deer burger in tsumago that was indescribable. I live knowing I’ll never find it again
14:03 “the sound of a running stream”  *slurp*  No, Chris. That’s not a running stream that I want to hear.
I don't comment too often but gotta say you guys are my best duo. I have been watching Chris ever since I was a kid and I wanted to visit Japan ever since. Booked my first ever trip to Japan this summer and now I have to rewatch his old videos again haha. Thank you so much for filming Chris and thanks for bringing Ryotaro back. You are the best!
Ryopororo!
Chris, please be nice to Ryototoro. He's a real one💝
So, I know this video is old news now, but I just had to drop a comment…which I never do. This video inspired me and my 4 travel companions to carve out a stay at Byaku Narai in October 2024. The drive from Nagoya was stunning (and not at all difficult if you’re even just slightly adventurous). The town, the views and the vibe there, the hotel, the food and drinks….absolutely unforgettable. So much so that I just booked another stay there for my next trip in a couple months with 4 new travel companions. Sincere thanks to you and your extended vlogging family for the content you all provide. I so appreciate being able to live vicariously through your videos when I miss my home away from home. Can’t wait to check out Lost Bar on my next trip! Couldn’t quite squeeze it in on my last trip. Anyways, just wanted you to know how much your work is appreciated and the impact it can have on people. Our journey to Narai is one that we could never forget and much thanks is owed to you.
When did Natsuki make that Mr. Miyagi joke? I need to see that video
team soil room
I went there this winter too~~~ love it
Beautifully filmed video!  Could you please tell us where you went in Magome for dessert and matcha?  Thank you! \
Hey Chris your the best on YouTube   How do I find these places to stay? I looked on booking and abnb and couldn’t find the one your friend had? Thanks
Affable room
Loved the video! I highly recommend following the trail from Magomejuku to Tsumagojuku on foot (7km). It's such a beautiful hike and there's a cute house in the middle of nowhere where you can sit by the fire, enjoy a cup of tea and talk to the friendly owner. There are also beautiful waterfalls that you encounter during this hike.
I would love to see you do this with Connor for the whole five day trek
17:25のエアコンで雰囲気ぶち壊しですね
Please redo this with hiking and stuff and adding even more history as well. Would love to see more about this place(s). Could easily watch this for two hours.
i know its unreasonable  but i am upset u didnt try the john lennon icecream
This video, in summary:  "After dinner, we had to go get lunch. And then checking in to our next hotel, a quick soak before dinner. I'm very hungry."
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
it seems very foolish to eat bear meat, specially raw, since bears are full of Parasites, eggs and tape Worms, wich humans can be infected with, i say the same to raw horse sashimi and chicken, sometimes japan has very strange choices of Food.
Firstly, thanks for letting me know about the spiders - saved me a long screaming run. Secondly, what happened with the cash? Did someone pay up? Did you have to write an IOU?
Can't believe I missed this video, what an awesome trail
Even as time passes and the surface of the city changes, nothing remains the same in terms of what lies at the root of Japan's unique culture. The common root of the originality of Japanese culture is the uniqueness of its geopolitical isolated location and the influence of its special natural environment. Even if culture and knowledge are imported from abroad, it is not dominated by them, but rather, after a certain period of time, it is able to select and discard the content, integrate it with its own culture, make repeated improvements to fit its environment, and eventually create its own new style.  This is due to the influence of Japan's unique natural environment, which is both rich and harsh, and is very different from the natural environment on the continent.  Japan's original country name "NIPPON" means "the country under the sun," but its other name is "YAMATO (WA, DaiWa)," which means "peaceful harmony between people and nature.　In other words, the name of Japan is "the country under the sun," meaning the country of "great harmony between people and nature. The history of Japan is very old, about 2,000 years since the reign of the Emperor, but it was during the "Jomon Pottery" culture about 14,000 years ago that humans began to form villages and communities and live in this island nation. (It was about 30,000 years ago if the Neolithic Age is included.)  Surrounded on all sides by the sea and geographically isolated from the Eurasian continent in the Pacific Ocean, this island nation has a warm and humid climate, and because it is a volcanic island, it is blessed with abundant underground clear water resources, diverse vegetation, and fishery resources. For this reason, people have lived here for tens of thousands of years, enjoying the abundant nature and living in peace with nature. However, while the natural environment of this island nation is rich, it is also harsh and has both light and dark sides. Since ancient times, the people of this land have respected human harmony and have lived in peace by working together as a group. They have shared and enjoyed the blessings of nature by pooling their wisdom and collectively overcoming numerous severe and harsh natural disasters, such as frequent volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunami, summer typhoons, and heavy snowfall in winter. This is because this island nation has a harsh natural environment that cannot be overcome by a single person. Individual power is too weak to face the onslaught of nature, which can destroy the wealth we have built overnight. Therefore, many people should suppress their egos, dislike confrontation, and work together to create a livable environment and maintain cleanliness, and then work together to prevent disasters before they occur and to restore the environment after they have occurred. This is the most wise, efficient, and rational way to maintain peace and harmony in each other's lives, rather than to create more chaos by insisting on each other's selfishness, which has given rise to Japan's unique teachings, culture, and behavior.  The ancient name of Japan, "YAMATO" or "WA" (peaceful harmony between people and nature), represents the wishes and reality of the people who have been trying to survive in the rich and harsh natural environment unique to island countries, which is different from the dry and stable land of the Eurasian continent. And it is in this ancient Japanese country name "WA YAMATO" that the essence of Japanese culture, the origin and secret of its unique culture, which is very different from the cultures of other Asian countries on the continent, is hidden.
That black room was stunning. Nice to see you talking about us for kind of the first time with Sharla.
I like ole Ryotarou...Miss him
what are the best walking shoes for Japan?  I want to look nice and stylish but the same time give my feet some cushioning.   How about those new Aaron Roger dress sneakers?
These places are just indescribably beautiful ❤🌿 Thank you for taking us with you ^^
That was lovely seeing the traditional towns. Such beautiful architecture, and lovely gardens with the houses. A shame Japanese authorities don't build bypass roads and car parks down the outside of the town and pedestrianise the centre, but that might yet happen in the future.
5:35 Please tell me you made a t-shirt of "She loves my slurp"
11:04  now hes just having too much fun with the editing 😂😂
Imagine going somewhere and not bringing a credit card with you... oh, wait, didn't bring CASH
I think the guilt should come from the bear being wildlife, whereas a cow/beef is a farmed animal bred for slaughter and eating.
Chris is more of a food vlogger than a travel one 😂
とても楽しく見させてもらいました。 素敵な紹介動画です。共有ありがとうございます。
I can't help but think of samurai x and samurai champloo when I was watching this
“She loves my slurp” this is why Ryotaro is the loml
I find it very interesting how Australia and Japan have so many of the same spiders. That was a lovely female red back spider 🕷️ if I’m not mistaken. Great video.
Beautifully made video. But then, i'm pissed so everything looks beautiful 😂
👌❤️⛩️
Those ryokans sure look nice, but they charge 400$ per night 😅
I love how traditional and preserved those towns look! And that last house you stayed in...looks so cool. I could see staying there when it wasn't too cold...otherwise the lack of any insulation would be pretty hard to deal with in Winter lol.
Using cash is good. Using card is bad. Why is that so hard to understand?
I hope my final form is ryotaro when I'm his age 😂😂😂
I love every time Rytoro is trying to passionately explain an aspect of a ryokan, Chris dismissively cuts him off with a short quip. Like just let your mate finish what he was saying you don't have to force a comedic insert every 2 seconds.
Narajuku harajuku its all the same
Missed opportunity to say how much you enjoyed the winnie the shapooh shapooh.
Chris, I was there on the hike from Magome to Tsumago a few days ago. It's worth letting people know this is Mamushi snake territory. I was literally inches away from stepping into one. It's the most venomous snake in Japan and I could have died. People should watch very carefully where they are stepping.  Not to mention, it's also nice carrying a bell for bears. Thank you for the recommendation though. Magome was the best part of trip for us. ❤ - Ps: I met Sharla at the Gokofuji station today. She was a sweetheart and overwhelmingly kind. What a lucky guy you are. 😊
Very Curious what month this was filmed, my guess would be September or maybe early October based on the leaves and weather?
Chris was pretty boring in this video honestly, not like his usual self
14:29 So... how did they pay then lol
wow what a cool trip i'd love that *_* i am pretty sure i could never afford it though it all looked very expensive...
Ive got some wood for you to smell Chris, every morning when i wake up 🌄
Ive got something for Ryotaro to slurp on 😉
Bear casually strolling out of his Big Blue House 😂😂 and making his cameo in Japan
Brazilian government would never allow a restaurant to servel a meat of native animal, however you may find some doing it illegally.
Ryotaro is such a great tour guide- lots of nice little insights and factoids from him. Awesome video as always!
I love binge watching these vlogs
I really want to move there 😢
15:25 editor you knew what you were doing
I swear Ryotaro is aging backwards.
I've had bear sausage, way back when I was in my early teens, at a Native American powwow. I'd love to try, what looks like, bear bacon, haha
15:57
I too love ryotaro's slurp and yes I would also pick his room
Wow, this is a bucket list trip! Thank you for sharing ❤
Wow! Chris, you never cease to amaze me with your erudite and fun  commentary. Well done!
Chris says the journey series are Patreon backed, but I'm legit saying he's getting extra funding from more the Dr. Jelly and NO MORE VOLCANO...
I love Ryotaro's room/building! I would love to stay there. And possibly never leave.
Chris not just the cars spoil the atmosphere and the very sarcastic British guy who I like to hear him narrate, and the videos with Riotoro are some of the best that
Absolutely the most beautiful scenes of Japan I've ever witnessed. Just gorgeous. Will be there in October for a 10th wedding anniversary and can't wait to experience this  !  Thank you for sharing this.
The bear 🐻 😂
He said take the car 😢😢😢😢
They so smashed
I’m doing the same trip. But I can’t find the traditional house you rented. Can you give me the name or a hint?
Did I say today that I love your work man !? I lie, I freaking adore it. Thanks brother.
Ryotaro is my favourite character from the whole of Youtube. Chris is the third.
I've already booked my ticket, I'll be in Japan in October :)))
Gorgeous!!!! Adding this on my to-visit list!!!
The 10:40 cut was so sudden I thought it was an ad
The bear walking behind them while they were talking about eating bear made me laugh my ass off
A friend recommend me your channel and is really awesome! Japan has many interesting places and well, food is outstanding!
13:14 I thought you said Sumago for a sec and I immediately thought "Is that an anagram for Sugoma?"
Risottoro is amazing as always
J... E... T... S..., JETS, JETS, JETS. lol didn't expect to see that in a japan video hehe
You Guys are the best. I love❤ Your Crew and Natsuki......I would love to see Japan and Okinawa. Shout out from France but original from Toronto CND. 🖐🖐
Hi Chris.  I went to Megamo.  I’ll be back in Tokyo next week.  Where is your shop?
I'd be interested in trying Japanese bear. I live in New England and I've NEVER had bear that didn't taste absolutely awful. Omnivores are not meant to be be eaten I suppose.
I was eating and looked up as the bear was just walking behind you guys 😂 I had to rewind and watch it again just to make sure I wasn’t losing my shit!
awesome!!!
love the "faffable" room!
I honestly thought he was gonna say "restraunt has contract, with bear"
John Lennon frequently came to Japan privately for family vacation with Yoko and Sean. They stayed at a vacation home in Karuizawa, Nagano prefecture that Yoko’s family owned. Yoko is from very rich family and Karuizawa is known as rich people’s favorite summer resort just like Hampton or Martha’s Vineyard. I have visited a hotel near their vacation home. John and Yoko liked the restaurant and cafe at this hotel and some menu were still advertised as John’s favorite. Nakasendo is famous tourist destination in the same prefecture, so it’s very possible that John had visited there.
We stopped at that Nikuman shop around closing time back in early January 2019. That old guy at 15:26 was so nice, inviting us in and chatting around his fire eating Nikuman until well after closing time.
Mr British 😂
Since I will probably never be able to afford seeing Japan in person, your wonderful videos are always a joy.   Those three towns were gorgeous!
The room feels like you're in a Bond villain's lair and you all should look around for listening devices.
the colors are gorgeous!!!!! i love the camera work, as always. and yay, more sharla content ^3^
Polygamy?? Nice famiy
Japan looks so clean, the people seem to genuinely respect their land, and take care of it unlike where I live.
Jon Lennon is my father and I am sure he ate there !
Cultural or not the freaking slurping....
That's your boyfriend that is
YoKo Ono is my neighbor in NY... Never knew she was my neighbor till few months ago.
A bear that has been feasting on marmalade would probably have the tastiest flesh, so Paddington isn't off limits is all I'm saying.
i want to go to japan so badly
You probably already do this, but can you do some shorts of each video lie the best bits of each town in a short i reckon itd be really popular.
Does anyone know the name of the traditional home he stayed in towards the end of the video?
Sharla was in the bear suit while yall were eating bear.
Have you ever been to Sanya? Or any other place off the tourist map???
Have you ever been to Sanya or any other place off the tourist map???
these small towns are so damn beautiful
Ryotaros' room
Stunning!!!!
Okay as a Brit, Ryotaro's "Mr British" is hilarious.
Lmao at "wax on, wax off, fuck off". 🤣
"She loves my slurp" I nearly spit out my coffee
Cant wait to go on the biggest bulk ever in japan
Seeing the bear in the background and I was like am I high or insane? 😂
10/10 video!
More often the beaten path videos like this! I love this kind of content, and would be cool to see you visit a bunch of different maintainers of different crafts that a lot smaller towns in more rural areas pride themselves on.
I watched this video after beating Ishin and now I can't help but chuckle at a British man staying in a traditional inn smh
That last house was stunning!
anyone else think sharla was dressed as the bear and ninja behind them 🤣
As someone with misophonia, I don’t think I’d survive Japan eateries lol or Ryototo 😂
Thank you for the adding the maps!
smelling each others wood i see.....
Im definitely doing this trail!! Looks so picturesque and the food looks like I'm going to need to diet after
I am just crying at how beautiful everything there is and how much I want to go there..
Congratulations, Chris and Sharla. You both make such great content and seem like genuinely good people. To many years of happiness and good fortune.
Bear?
I liked Ryotaro's room better.
I do wish this was a full hike. I love the last few hike videos and i look forward to seeing more if you continue to do them.
The super rapid switch from me taking excited anticipatory notes, to me hell nope'ing it once there was a mention of spiders...  Would there be fewer arachnids in spring? Please?
About 90% hotel/restaurant advertisement, 10% actual village content.
LOL LOL LOL Ryotaro is such a joker
N----.No.
I'm just finishing up my trip in Japan and I went on the route from magome to tsumago and it was such a peaceful walk with a really friendly volunteer giving green tea halfway
Ryotaro’s British accent is S tier
2:05 zesty aah
chris brought out the big guns with this one. he brought along an actual bear. if this video isn't his most successful work yet, i'm going to be very disappointed.
What month/week was this filmed on ? I'm considering going back to Japan next autumn (for maple leaves, mostly) and that seems like a pretty nice hike to enjoy it fully.
Glad to see Sharla is a New York Jets fan
"Morecambe and Wise go East".
It’s also divided by electricity frequency
“She loves my slurp”… 🤣 never change Ryotaro, never change
Mindblowing beautiful 🤩
Nagano not only has great food. There are also a lot of nice beers out of there as well.
Chris you are looking more in shape now. So proud of you.
Awesome video mate! I'm just playing catchup after returning from 3 weeks in Japan myself, Including visiting your Fried Chicken rock on the coast of Hokkaido near Otaru. Your winter in Hokkaido video with Pete inspired me to do my own week-long road trip up there! Cheers mate!
5:42 Ryotaro with the rizz
i wish i could teleport myself there.
Love these kind of videos. It was the reason I followed years ago.  I keep them and wait until I need something to bring my mood back up after a long day of work.   Have you ever considered doing a journey across Japan but only in an ev ?  I have not seen any ev videos with this kind of aesthetic and planning in Japan yet. Plus as someone whom I think never drove one, his experience might be interesting.  Maybe even sleep in one. Also congrats on the engagement.
The irony of Chris complaining about the cars ruining the aesthetic and him driving the whole trail... LOL
thanks for the video!
"She loves my slurp" 🤣🤣🤣🤣 That is absolutely beautiful all of the places but I do agree with the 2nd being somewhere I would want to live, those little village houses would be a wonderful place to stay, is there a link...?
Miatas make me angry too
Ryotaro makes slow motion strolling always look so sexy and chill.
I still haven't forgiven you for taking Conner instead of Sharla to the most expensive hotel in Japan so it was nice seeing you take her to a few nice places in Nakasendo even if you had your 3rd wheel companion Roytaro (who is wonderful).
Right?
Please never stop making travel videos like these they are awesome !
Places like these make me fall in love with Japan again.
I love ur videos, it is mostly entertaining, somewhat educational, and fun to watch.  But to be perfectly honest I really miss the miserable n cynical Chris, also the hate mail edition, and "wacky weekend" videos.  Seems like ur ''happier" ofc nothing wrong with that, but it looked like ur life is full of rainbows and unicorns. Happy for u, but pls bring the miserable n cynical back!
Is it me or does Chris sound less miserable now. The sarcastic remain the same though.
Mr.Slurp the one to dethrone Dr.Jelly
I think that Chris should hike in Japan’s three national parks, I’d especially love to see Chris in Daisekirinzan.
I'm already planning a trip to Tokyo, kyoto and osaka this fall but this makes me want to start planning for a second trip to visit these places!
Lovely places to stay! Really enjoyed this.
16:13 Are you able to share the name of the ryokan in Tsumago? Planning a trip for this fall!
That bear edited in 😂 I can’t
Wow, Ryotaro actually does a passably good British accent. I'm impressed. And after all the videos you've done explaining that Japan is a cash society, I'm shocked you would have done this without bring a wad of cash. You didn't take your own advice.
How about this time you make a series video about all hidden gems place across japan?
Insider leak: Sharla is pregnant right now. Shhhhhhh
Chris lowcar enjoyer confirmed.
That's the happiest I've seen you in any of your adventures, Chris. A solid breath of freedom I bet :)
Apparently John Lennon stayed at the Mampei Hotel for four summers in a row, from 1976 to 1979 (With Dean and Yoko, the family enjoyed long bike rides on the plateau, in the middle of nature and second homes) So I guess he also went to the ice-cream shop too
Love!
So glad! Taking time to see you is worthy.✨✨✨
Just dump some water on your head. Lol
Hey, who is the guy with the Heat Mate? His videos are so cool.
I don't care what you say. I love my Honda. Lolololololololol
Thanks!
Sometimes you eat the bear sometimes the bear eats you.
I’ve visited the narai back in 2010. It was the beginning of December and raining. So we were only there for a short time. But it was great to visit. Nice atmosphere. And almost no cars😂
I might miss it but did you drive to Nagano from Tokyo? I checked the fastest transportation option from Tokyo to there but it seems you need to make at least one transfer.
Don't swear!
Love this look at an amazing part of Japan. So beautiful!
Who comes from neuro sama
this is nice, its been awhile since ive watched a travel video from your channel chris, im hoping for more travel videos!
As someone who is well over 6 feet tall, I think I would break everything in Japan. Those seats do not look capable of holding me.
awesome video!
zaru soba is my absolute fav healthy japanese food!
Pete deserves this!!! Boo!!
do sharla started a mukbang career ?
I've been watching your videos practically all day long for the last 2 days. I've never binge-watched a channel before, but your videos are amazing.
😊
The videos with Ryotaro truly are the best
holy moly, I just LOVE the music in this video! It's so stylish!
I feel like I would choke to death slurping like that.
What Chris says: "There's not much separation between indoors and outdoors." What I hear: "Bugs are everywhere and will crawl on you in your sleep."
Faffable I'm sorry Chris
Chris drinking a traditional Irn-Bru at the end there.
Your shots are always so beautiful, the production quality is truly on par with what I used to see on like tv reports or documentaries (but even better bc of the fun commentary 😊) This also straight up went to my japan travel recs haha I'd love to hike a part of that trail! It looks so calm and just remote enough for what I need in my life atm...
That ''storage' at 8:12 is indeed a kind of storage called 土蔵. and they in fact sealed the door in case of fire with some clay. If you look hard enough you can still find some even in Tokyo.
Is it a rule that when sitting the dominate hand must be bumping against each other 😂
Mate, the production value on your videos has been consistently top-tier for years, the actual content is always an impressive blend of informative and entertaining, and the way that you balance self-deprecating humour and light-hearted cynicism with grounded humility and sincerity makes your stuff easy to watch, not to mention your roster of awesome friends. You've accomplished a lot, especially in recent months, and somehow I feel like you are underrated among your peers, and although there is an endless stream of thousands of people yelling their thoughts at you, I feel compelled to say - good work bro.
I traveled in the late Spring-very early Summer, so caught the sakura 'season; that pleased me a lot, but I can see that Autumn has a lot of charm, too!  Thanks for bringing us along : ))
Not sure if it’s your new editor or a change of style but the editing was a great laugh
video request: a day with a bear hunter.
Ryotaro makes it MORE romantic smh
how did you do the bear in the background?? that's quite impressive to the untrained eye... thought you needed a green screen for that
1:15 car casually drives by, blasting Too Much Volcano
Mr Slurpie LMAO
5:41 legendary Ryotaro moment.
Ryotaro's "peasant" hit so hard I felt like paying him my taxes.
Looking good mate you and her both any private ''xxxtube etc'' reproduction tutorial videos in working for an American Brit, more or less Native in Japan?  Not that Ryotaro isnt a good start as an exntened family, for these trips ;)
Ryotaro can slurp everything. He can probably slurp steak as well.
damn these places look so lovely
Wow, Ryotaro has become really good at english. As well as lost weight and turned old :O Good to see him again.
"right" 🤣  Good video sir 👍🏻
John Lennon's favorite ice cream wasn't Ben & Jerry's Imagine Whirlled Peace?  Seriously?
Such a beautiful place
Faffable room. I like the lighter colored wood and warmer lighting.
I spat my coffee out laughing so loud when the bear walked on by in the restaurant... Winnie the Pooh.... LOL
Literally JUST booked accomodations for a 5 day hiking trip along this trail :D probably my dream holiday. can't wait for spring
Was not expecting to see my favorite football team in a video about japan. GO JETS
Ryotaro’s slurp hey yoooo
Regarding John Lenon: Ono Yoko's family owns property in Karuizawa, and he frequented the big fancy hotel there while in country every year.  Ono's house is still there (although abandoned), not far of the quaint old main street - near where Emperor Hirohito met his wife playing tennis.  There is also a large plait of land around the corner from that which was once owned by the Tokugawa's that was part of the forced forfeiture of property by the Americans following WWII.  While that property is now a retreat center for Christian missionaries, they have kept the old Tokugawa property boundary markers that bear the name in place.  Super cool history there.
I’m in Japan for 3 months and I guarantee you I’m doing that in a week maximum
Totally lost it when I saw the bear 🤣
Glade your guys are back..i loved your videos in uk congrats on the belt..and see nasty too..almost valentines day..well be safeu ne...nasty coming back..omerito again on the belt
日本人だけどこんな旅したいよ
Poor Winnie the Pooh oh my gosh😅🥲
That’s so wrong she likes his slurp she must really taste good no friends but that just wow I can’t look at soup the same again even though I like Ramen😅🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Yeah, slurp
I would subscribe to your patreon for bath time with broad
Im jealous of you, but then again you are a part of a ring of the most famous people in Japan right now. I try not to get jealous but I am. I love  bushes in japanese towns and I see some.
My wife and I stayed at a hotsprings hotel in Gunma. It was beautiful in the mountains. We didn't see any initial D races though...
Is it just me or Chriss has gotten Hotter especially in his thumbnail?
Sharla is such an adorable cutie, I love that you two are together and love when you make content together! ❤️
I love your content, it's so cool to get to see all the amazing things and locations in japan through expertly directed cinematography in the form of YouTube vlogs! P.s. Sharla is absolutely beautiful and I love that you two are together! ❤️
feels bad eating an animal that would rip to pieces and eat you, but cows which are docile calm animals that will literally lick your cheek and nuzzle you... lol don't get me wrong I don't feel bad eating either but why tf do people have this fuzzy feeling about bears? The real world isn't a cartoon you aren't eating teddy bears. It's wild game which is far more ethical than farmed meat... people are strange.
I would love to live there
Ha… photobombed by Bear as he’s on holiday from the Big Blue House…
More please! Awesome to see Sharla and Ryotoro in your videos too.
So you wouldn't eat Paddington, but you would Kumamon, poor Kumamon 😂
Miata spotted!
Well that's a nice touch with the text on the video here and there! ☺
Chris I know it would be a lot of work, but it would get millions of views if you and anyone in your crew would do the whole 5 day hike and filmed at least the interesting parts
HAHA you really should do a podcast in an onsen😂
Finally a normal thumbnail!!!
going to the country side and doing another one of these but every place you have to go to you must write a well thought out haiku
I’m actually doing the Nakasendo trail right now with the Conqueror Challenges! This is so cool! ❤
"she loves my slurp" -Ryotaro 2023 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If you have bear meat remember to cook it well done, It's not like beef and you will have explosive dhiaria for the next 3 weeks if you even survive.
Great video. I love these chilled out episodes in the countryside.
it's weird you say you didn't see that many spiders in all your years?  I've noticed when I went to Japan in early october there were lots of spiders outside compared to another month like May where I also visited (same-ish locations). I figured there must be one season more pleasent for spiders (and as I hate them, i'll avoid this time of the year I guess, haha)
I will never look at Winnie the pooh the same way again. Lol
ice poseidon was here
So this is where you would wanna be when those tsunamis come? Or did they reach here too?!?
Sharla's a Jets fan? Who would have known. Represent, Sharla, represent.
you should do another QnA video!
I'm curious how they handle the mosquito problem on the hotel
821k viewers in 4 days?! Damn. I have been watching Chris' videos for almost 10 years and he has done some great videos in the past, but it's crazy the amount of views he is getting recently and for this video. I guess he got a bunch of new subscribers from all the collaborations in the last year. This is just a pretty basic Nakasendo video no different to any J-Vlogger that's done it, but I guess he has done very well to sell himself. He has put in the effort so I guess its starting to pay off.
It would be cool to see you visit, Aogashima. It's said to have an estimated population of 170 people and the last google images that were taken were around the year of 2018.
I definitely want to walk the Nakasendo one day. Seems like a great way to see the countryside and stop for food each day as you stop by the towns.
Ryotaro has a solid fake British accent 👍
Okay.
Keep up the quality videos ,love watching your videos while making plans for when I go in September 😊
Not to be “that guy” but the proper name for bear bowl would likely be the “on” reading for kuma which would be yuu, so yuudon.
Id reccomend if you ever have a chance, try kangaroo meat aswell Id imagine bear taste game'ie which was the same with roo for me but I really love it
If I ever make holidays in Japan I'm gonna rely soly on Abroad in Japan.
We're going to Japan for two weeks in April, largely inspired by years of your videos! What was the name of the ryokan with the houses you stayed at in Nagataki? Thanks!
15:27 I laughed out loud seeing a Yankee cap in remote, mountainous Japan. No wonder the Yanks are the richest team in baseball!
Chris, if you haven't asked Sharla to be your wife yet (i havent seen your videos for a while), you hurry up!! She is a keeper, in any country of the world!
faffable room for the win. I love these travel videos & the cultural stuff you include is just wonderful. This place is just beautiful. keep up the great work!
Beautiful beautiful beautiful work
nice
Not very hidden is it, John Smith.
Chris should get Kumadon on the menu of his restaurant
5:42 HAHAHAH I'm dying
Lovely video, very enjoyable. Beautiful scenery, really looked like being back in the past. I'd appreciate more videos of this type, please.
Ryotaro (Risottoro) is my favorite Abroad in Japan guest star,  hands down.
That it's finally me and you, and you and me. Just us, and your friend Steve.
Loved it. You guys are holding it down as my favorite channel. One thing tho.. wheres Dr. Jelly?
I just realized it's only a matter of time til we see Chris and Sharla in an onsen together...
At 13:17 the water wheel behind you is rocking back and forth, do you have any idea why please
8:38 i never thooguth i'd hear a japanese man say innit xD
The hotel room in the kura was absolutely gorgeous. I would definitely choose it.
When I retire, I want to live the rest of my life in a Japanese mountain village, and no one can stop me
I miss these kinds of videos, keep them coming please!
Gimme all the travel videos!! It's like travelling with friends
Oh! I've been to Magome! It was stunning. Didn't get to do the hike either, but we did get a little further west to Shirakawa-Go
unleash the ultimate attack: *risotto slurp*
Attenborough vibes with the commentary
I am planning an autumn trip to Japan and I'd love to know when this was filmed, as the way things look this is exactly when I'd like to try to go. Coming from the frozen north my autumn happens a lot earlier than it seems to in Japan.
This is so well done! This could be a Netflix documentary
What is the name of this last Traditional Japanese Home? I can't find it in the Web.
A video about Japan with a good amount of British sarcasm always brighten my day.
Tell me you're dating without telling me you're dating : Chris - 69 HAHAHAHAHA 😈
Bath-time with broad is something I need
@5:41 almost spit out my drink lmao
The hotel is so beautiful! Japan has so many different faces and we love all of them.
With tourists coming back to japan, I wonder how many of Chris' viewers went on a pilgrimage to natsuki's salon in yamagata.
I really like the more intimate videos like this one where you spend more time in an area vs going to 50 place. Also these places are beautiful
Ryotaro is like the third wheel during a date
Love the Video!
What makes these towns even nicer is that unlike every other town in Japan, there are very few visible power lines.
Ah yes... Ryotaro and his cheeky lines are back 😁😁😁
my heart dropped when the bear walked behind them LMFAO great video!
Mountain villages are beautiful
I walked from a JR station to Tsumago and then to Magome (downhill direction) in one day a few years ago. The sunset from Magome is spectacular.
I know the loud slurping is a culture thing, but I can't still get used to it!  LOL.  Don't get me wrong, I love Japan, I just can't get used to it.  Thank god is not a deal breaker for me to live in Japan.
The logo of the byaku in is so genius It combines the roman numerals 100 and the kanji 百
"She loves my slurp" - Slurp King Ryotaro, circa 2023
Actually walking from Magome to Tsumago leads you over an old part of the Nakasendo trail and it also goes past a few waterfalls. You guys missed out on that. There is also a great Chaya just outside the village of Magome.  There is also a post office with working ATM in Magome so a bit of exploring would have gotten you some cash.
You remind of David Attenborough they way you describe scenery. With comedy of course
there is something different about the  editing. almost sure there was enough b roll to not use the same over and over again.
Chris be careful what you joke about! Abroad In A Pan was a joke and it happened so it might not be too long before Bath Time With Abroad is an actual thing! XD
So, might have missed this but are Sharla and Chris together? An innocent question, as I'm just ignorant but have followed them both for some time.
When your parents chaperone your date
Phew, in the first few seconds I feared, there will be now Ryotoro - Jokes anymore😮‍💨Please, never scare me like this again, Chris!😂
Is it me, or this video looks like it was recorded on hdr and poorly converted to sdr? The color profile looks like trash and it's over sharpened at some points
Chris knows that in order to get me to like this video he has to be half naked in a bath.  Bless you young man.
Nothing has made me want to visit Japan more than this video. Those towns and hotels looked incredible. Of course, the cuisine looks great as well.
Loving this content. Definitely putting this on my to do list for my next trip to japan ☺️
Dude when you gonna marry her? She likes you so much…
Not enough door between room and the spiders D:
🤣🤣🤣🤣 I absolutely lost it with the strutting bear.
It's absolutely amazing to experience such a different perspective on life and the surrounding beauty. Almost feels like under all the things from day-to-day life, we forget to take a breath and absorb instead of being sucked into the craziness. Thank you for sharing this and I wish you all the best :)
LOVED this video!  Missed these kinds of videos, as you always put so much attention to the details around you, and it's fascinating for someone like me who can only hope & dream to go to Japan someday!   So kudos to the return of these videos!!   Also, you made autumn in Japan look stunning!!   Great to see adventures with Ryotoro as well, and now Sharla!  yay! Thanks again for this video, it really hit the spot!!  Looking forward to hopefully more!!
I think that much of Japanese culture is really beautiful, but the noodle slurping... It does not please me.
Not sure if anyone else agrees with this but my favorite part about this channel is that unlike a lot of other Vlog/travel channels Chris picks locations that you truly would not have every heard of. Obscure tourists stuff that still is accommodating.  So I guess this trail will get added to the list now.
That shabu shabu made me so hungry that I need to order some food as stores are closed and the bread I have would not satisfy me after seeing that godly treat. Thanks a lot man
Get outta here xD the garden around the last house is just wowowowowoowwoow 😍
I could already tell from the last two videos but it seems you LOST a significant amount of weight.
@4:25 how was the raw egg Chris? Tummy go boom?
the only thing I see is a third wheel on a date
Cars are much better than those "beautiful streets."
Mushroom Mushroom!!!
All spiders are venomous chris.
1:34 They couldn't have introduced Ryotaro in a better way.
Must be awkward to be the third wheel in such a passionate romance between Chris and Ryotaro.
Love your videos!! I can't wait until I get to explore Japan!
21:32 / 21:51
I was not expecting this vlog to be funny, but you got me hahahaha! Thank you for sharing your experience!
Hah - faffable vs affable, I like that one
Love these videos!! Never stop. I love seeing different areas I would otherwise not know to check out. So much cool architecture mixed with the nature. And the nice rooms you guys got felt so unique but also homely. Damn i wish i was in japan
how did u get that Bear to walk past.... Impressive
I can imagine the room you stayed in for the second night would be pretty cold in the winter with those shoji window dividers.
Watching this before bed, just took a huge dab.  The bear and ninja really messed with me. Haha I couldn't tell if it was a person in a costume or what at first.  If it was me I'd pick the more modern room in the first hotel. I really liked the black walls and the overall layout. Very cozy indeed
Nice side facts for the trail:  There are signs at the beginning of the towns explaining rules to abide. One of those rules in the old days was also that if you knew about any "hidden Christian", seeing as Christianity just like anywhere else in the world was trying to take over everything, that you could report them for money. There supposedly were quite a lot of hidden Christians and you might find some statues where the faces have been taken away but some features of statues may remind you of Maria.
Ryotaro is the goat
Its nicely done please ask norm to do one with u
I live in Nagano Prefecture and I had no idea that this place existed. Thanks for filming this and giving me and many others more traveling ideas!
Damn, Tokugawa really was a strategic genius, who comes up with that?
Background:  Sharla just being ravishing
69!!!!! NICE!!!!
Leave Sharla at home next time
4:50 Of course they'd sit on the wrong side again hahahaha
Thanks for the great post. I walked part of this trail 6 years ago. Please remind your viewers to wear long trousers. There’s a weed growing which gives rise to a horrible itchy rash which takes weeks to heal. It’s ugly . and unpleasant. Happy trails.
These are fantastic videos...keep making more. From Japanontology
No longer "hidden" is it then?
Great video and just looks amazing.
Risottoro is back!
John Lennons favorite ice cream has the same vibe as George Washington slept here or if you are British Queen Elizabeth
Man i thought ryotoro would be third wheeling, I was so wrong. Hope charlottes ok 😂😂
Amazing. Gorgeous. I so hope to visit this some day. Chris, your videos are well executed, amusing, and educational. It makes me so nostalgic. Thank you for all your hard work.
Hello, I adore your videos. On all your travels would you happen to notice if the places could suit vegans? I know it's not your thing, but it would be lovely if you remembered a few possible spots. 🥰
Fantastic! I love the traditional architecture, so cool 😚
If ever the opportunity should arise, maybe visit a old mining village. I was always intrigued by the seeming lack of iron ore Japan had. But maybe I just got the wrong impression throughout the years?
U make good vids to fall asleep to Chris. Soothing voice.
would have been better if more scenery shots were there
For a second I was expecting Stew Pork to be a British character played by Rissotaro
I honestly don't have the words to describe the beauty of towns like these. This is one of your best videos yet Chris. If they had internet I would move to a place like this in a heartbeat.
The bear and the samurai were great.
What do you call those chairs that have no legs in 17:20?
10:59 surprisingly only once huh? I would thought more the one but okay.
What a dream
Hi Chris, you've polished your craft to the pinnacle of purveyors of Japan.  You rank with Donald Richie, Ezra Vogel, and Edwin Reischauer and with Ryotaro as your doppelganger--the two togther are without equal.  Cheers... (BTW, that "New York" sweatshirt was like an infestation; nice choice with choosing basic black.)
This place looks so beautiful! Would love to go there someday 😍
Don't eat Xi Jinping meat, you might turn communist.
Of course, Chris, there's that ONE elephant on the tatami you have never spoken about... yes, I'm talking about Sumo fighters... when are you going to show us your take on this iconic and typical Japanese tradition? It should be right up your alley ;) P.S. These walkabout videos are an absolute delight to watch since they often show parts of Japan we outsiders never get to see... including some stunning views and intriguing traditions. I can't imagine them to lose any interest at all... it shows us the often hidden beauty of Japan
Even after acknowledging it, still sitting eating with elbows bumping, haha.  Really enjoying the walking casual videos btw.
Ryotaro's "She loves my slurp" was hilarious. : 5:35
abroad in japan?? but youre not a woman
I need to say that your footage looks stunning. Amazingly beautiful pans and colour grading!
Any concerns about eating the bear meat?  Bear meat is known to carry trichonosis.  Just have to make sure it's thoroughly cooked.  Aging it doesn't get rid of parasites.
I loved this video a lot! It was entertaining, gave me a lot of insights into not so well known parts of Japan. Thank you and enjoyed it. 😀👍
Really enjoy your videos like the fact that you take the piss but you have total respect for your surroundings and the people.keep them coming
Woohoo Chris
A history lesson Along with the tour. 👍
This is where I’d rather go to in Japan…YuruCamp and Initial D were the reasons I learned more about the Japanese mountainous countryside and it’s small towns.
Lol. I’m pretty sure I’ve seen in multiple videos yours included to always have cash in Japan. Especially in rural Japan.  We all make mistakes lol
Ryotaro's level of English is incredibly authentic
This is so beautiful, I have to save it to watch, again!
I'm going to add these locations to my list for my next trip :)
Great!  Just loved this!  More like it, please!
Hello, I am Yukari living in Austraria as a working holiday. I would highly recommend you to visit Beppu, Oita. The town is very foreign friendly.Thanks
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
AWESOME  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
AMAZING  😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
12:44 NOICE!
faffable
Great video. Is this the weather I should expect second week of Feb 2023…. Looks warm…. Hoping for cooler weather. I already know there’s no snow. I should really think about Hokkaido instead of Nagano area.
Gotta get that Trichinosis
5:40  “She loves my slurp”  Ryotaro you dog! 😏
Pooh bear noooooooooooo😮
Right handed eatter should have sat on right side Bumping elbows while eatting Is frustrating
That bath looked gross
Beautiful Sharla in the beautiful garden ❤
ofc  yr  gf   <3
They only have one hidden village in the mountains?!
ryotoro   !!
I have to say Ryotaro's room looks more like a traditional Japanese house with a modern twist to it, looks super cosy and I would definitely take it over Chris' room.
Did you get a new editor or am I just noticing some minute changes in the editing style of your videos, I like the subtle use of the vertigo effect.
This is beautiful and so is Ryotero. Just a compliment ☺️
I’d rather take Chris room over ryo.
A romantic weekend with Sharla: 🙂 A romantic weekend with Sharla but also with Ryotaro: 😍
This is a neighborhood that became a tourist spot , japan is awesome
This is the best Wombo combo team ❤️ mutch love to you ❤️
Wonderful video. You all seem like very lovely people.
Love the editing of the video and the amazing shots.   But I don't know how i feel about the bear meat. Since it's in the winter. Does that mean that the animals are being killed while they are in hibernation(asleep)? Doesn't seem right...
Definitely the affable room. Ryotaro's room was oddly claustrophobic
The thumbnail Chris looked more like Anime in Japan
faffable
Is Natsuki OK? I miss his savantness… Another high quality touring Nihon video Cheers and thanks! When will you and Sharla marry? You are cute together!🤩
The editing is improving day by day. The Bear and Ninja were really cool.
You guys are adorable!  God bless 💕
i had never rly gotten the "thanku for making videos, it got me through dark times". i mean its a nice thing to say. but it always seemed to be on the most random types of videos.  however. these videos of chris just going around in japan doing stuff. the funny shit he says, the attitude and even his voice lmao. it have actually given me a feeling of calm in a time i wish i didnt have to experience. so i get those people now. and damn, thank u chris. thanks for making such good videos. im sure that for you this seems just as weird as i thought these comments were before. but it is genuine. it really helps. i hope you enjoy making these videos, because it really have made shit times bareable for me lately. even rewatching old ones.  cheers.
Yes Chris, I like your travel videos and your unique way of rendering them makes them fun with sone Brit humor.
9:26 holy shit those stairs gave me flashbacks of the house I grew up in as a child. First house my family lived in was one of those super ancient farmer houses and it had those exact kind of super narrow, steep wooden stairs! They were a fucking hazard. It's a miracle we fell down so rarely in the 13 years I lived there lol
the quality on this one is insane!!
For the record spiders are not poisonous they are venomous. Things that are poisonous are only a problem if you eat them, venom however is injected. As a gneral rule if you bite it and you die it's poisonous, but if it bites you and you die it's venomous. This is big pet peeve for me lol
how was the bath heated?
Chris is such a gentleman, has his GF hold the umbrella for him. English prick.
Love seeing Sharla in the vids!
Great video! How did you travel from Tokyo to Naraijuko?
Poor Sharla hanging around as the third wheel watching Cris sniffing Ryotaro's wood. Still shippin' Chryotaro
Nice video 😊
When are you gonna hold your wedding with Ryotaro?
12:55
Looks like a Sanyo OTTO stereo system from the late 1960’s early 70’s in the inn.
12:46 , Classic
Allways a good episode when Risottoro comes along.
that bear & ninja was top notch edited. for a second I thought Sarla was in bear costume
she loves my slurps... NO COMMENT O_O  LOL. Awesome guys
Poor Sharla having to third wheel a lovely date for Chris and Ryotoro.
That Magome Village is straight out of Genshin Impact Inazuma island.
Goat chris
So how did you pay them?
I pity the fool who attempts to visit Japan without first binging Chris' and Sharla's channels
Did the GPS and the internet worked well? Is it safe to explore around in the mountains?
That might be the most CGI i have seen in an Abroad in Japan since the infamous plane crash.
Thank you for taking us on such an amazing journey !
come on Chris, you didn't have to drag along Sharla, just to hide the fact that you wanted a romantic getaway with Rissotaro.
Mr.Slurpy and Mr.British are a good team. I guess Sharla can be Mr.Pretty?
Ryotaro o moteru neh? Ottokomae 😉😉
Hey man! I just wanted to say keep up the good work. Your videos helped inspire me to finally travel to Japan and it's been the best time of my life. Keep it up man you're awesome!
She loves my slurp 😁😁
I really want to go the last ryoukan. Its look like legit samurai houses.
“Economic prosperity.”  Haha. What’s joke.  And, do you know exactly HOW they became prosperous? They had skilled laborers. Do you know where those skilled laborers came from? About 500 years ago, the japanese barbarically kidnapped 50,000-200,000 Korean doctors, scholars, farmers, blacksmiths, pottery makers, artisans then the japanese FORCED the Koreans to teach the japanese these invaluable skills.   Before the so-called golden age of japan, there was the true Golden Age of Korea.   But most foreigners don’t know Jack about that part of japanese history. Conservative japanese deny this happened.   Japan. A joke.
The first few snapshots of Ryotoro was from previous videos that what I thought so when he actually appeared in the video kind of surprised me lol. And seems that Sharla was the third wheel lol. BTW, I enjoy this type or vibe of video sort of relaxing and comforting. Keep doing so Chris and thank you for taking us along
"she loves my slurp" had me dead
Serious question for someone wanting to leave their home city(LA): How would someone find work in Japan? How can I START there?
A culture vulture 😂
Best place to stay and eat in this trail is of course Magome Chaya, rated as best restaurant in the region. I cant believe, You didn't visit it!
Nobody cares about Joe Biden 😂
I did a day trip to Tsumago and Magome juku from Nagoya and LOVED it! Those buns were heavenly…… Great video!
But what we all want to know, Chris, does Ryotaro make a better cup of hotel room coffee than Connor "The Voice Actor" VA Dog?
6:20 you see char holding the umbrella for this king
This had all the beauty and charm and wit I'd expect from a Chris Broad video. But the bear... and then the ninja made me stop the play so I could choke with laughter.  Excellent video Mr Broad and team. Excellent.
I am absolutely baffled none of you thought to bring cash.
Walking*
I will never recover from knowing that Ryotaro's wife likes his slurping 😂.
Not sure if Chris and Ryotaro realised how much danger they were in. A ninja literally snuck past them and got attacked by another unknown assailant.   Glad they're fine.
What I love about your travel videos is getting to see the things that are off the beaten path and what you would never learn about in travel books. There is so much I want to see in Japan now that there’s not going to be enough time in just one trip.
Chris, you and Sharla look great together. Happy for you
Joining us on this romantic trip is Ryotaro, Japan's loudest sucker.
So lovely 😍
Moooaaarrr we neeed moaaarrrr gimme me moaaaaarrrrrr
Japan is really pretty
Beautiful
That bear walking in the background is hilarious!
You have the best job the world!! Love you videos man, it is so relaxing!
20:49 Ryotaro's superhuman aura just kills the ninja without him even noticing
I'm glad you came to my hometown!☆😆
He sounds like someone that does this type of documentaries:-)
I tune in for the wood smelling
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT SHARLA IS HOT! BUT DAMN!!!SHE DAMN SMOKIN'!!! LOL!!!
I live in Tono, the region of Gifu where Magome and Tsumago reside. Super happy to see a video about this beautiful place I call home!
i am definitely going to walk this trail one day!
Fucking love you Chris! So proud of the health progress you've made. You look so much healthier. Cheers 🥂 mate
💕💕💕💕
Chris, your production is next level. Not to fellate you, but your camera work is absolutely exquisite. I see the quality of your videos only ever going up. It's a good time to be a fan, my man.
I love videos with Chris and Ryotaro. Feels like the old days. With Sharla, it's just a bonus!
Ryokans with onsens and red meat are Chris’ version of “A day in the life” videos.
"Mr. British"
It's so hidden only a fat white guy can find it.
next time go on a double date and bring ryotoro's wife 🌝
Really a fun series of places. It's hard not to find something to appreciate about Japan.
Man, this seems like it would be a nice journey to have if ever I was to visit Japan. :)
I don't want to be 'She loves my slurp' age.
I'm sure bear tastes good, but in the wild they smell HORRIBLE. It is impossible to describe the scent. It's musky, rotten...offensive in every way. If you smelled a bear after it had been killed, you'd likely never want to try the meat.
Ryotaro x Chris is the best relationship 🤣😂🤣😂😂
Ryotaro means Unable to Detect Sarcasm in Japanese! LOL!
Well nobody asked you to do it! So who cares!
Finally visited Japan on a business trip. Stayed at Tokushima, but visited Osaka too! I must admit, I fell in love with the country, it's nature and it's people! Watching your videos helped me blend in, knowing their customs, what to expect and how to conduct myself when interacting with the locals. Thank you for that, Chris! If you want a great panoramic shot, go to Tokushima on a sunny day, and climb up the Mt. Bizan. The 360 view is breathtaking!
"How does your wife put up with you?" "She loves my slurp." lmfaoooo a sex joke in an AIJ vid?? 🤣
#45 on trending in the USA.
"She loves my slurp" HAHAHA Ryotaro is iconic
"she loves my slurp" 💀😂
THIS is my new travel goal.  Only I want to actually hike it.  Then at least I have an excuse to eat like ALL THE AMAZING FOOD, with at least a little less guilt.   So hopefully working off all the food calories by hiking.  Are there tour guides that specialize in that?  Eat all the good food then work it off hiking?  That's what I want.
You lucky bastards! These villages look so god damn calming and beautiful.
Absolutely stunning!  In a really fun twist of events, I may be spending Christmas through to New Years in Japan. I never thought the trip was going to happen, but if I have a clean bill of health, I'll soon be booking flights and rental accommodations. Both myself and my travel companion want to visit rural areas more than urban areas; I just hope I will be deemed fit to travel. I hate waiting for test results.
Jonty?
You know it was really nice of Chris to allow Sharla to come along on this trip with him and his boyfriend Ryotaro
Thanks for a cool video, hopefully I'll be able to visit Japan one day
Instantly excited as soon as i see charla taking part in the video! Yay for you two
Like a samurai, up in the sky... Cold steel in the afternoon.
Ryotaro's room is cool, but I definitely liked Chris and Sharla's better.  I love these kind of videos, I hope it does well!
Affable
How am I gonna survive as a vegan on these trips tho
Love this ❤
Loved it. Nice places and food
MORE WATER WHEEL!
Is it me, or does sharla look pregnant?
Not sure about the cgi touches
Great video! I'm honestly so impressed by how in shape Chris is every time I see him in videos.
i really like the videos with the japanse guy
“She loves my slurp.” Has to be the quote of the year!
Been there! Really liked it :)
We went through this area as part of our honeymoon! We got the train and a bus from Hakone to Magome, and then walked from there to Tsumago - and it was absolutely wonderful! Beautiful views. Did you end up seeing that teahouse on the way? The guy there had photos from one time he was visited by Joanna Lumley, he was so nice.
Bear causally walk in the background
No NOT miss out on trail between Magome and Tsumago. Its the easiest "hike" you will ever make. Infact its more like an easy walk. You can do that walk in half a day.  Stuning forests gentle streams and small "stair-case waterfall". Highly recommended!
Definitely The Wolverine film got the right feel. Really love the look of Magome. Wish we travel to Japan and take car there one day.:)
Just heard a British person call Oreos “chocolate sandwich biscuits” and I finally understand why the Revolutionary War had to happen.
Mr. British, everything looks so expensive, but its so beautiful ! greetings from Colombia.
People eating bear feels like a reversal of the natural order
Finally my favourite guest on this channel - Mr. Risottoro - is back! Loved the video, the jokes and the beautiful picures. These old Japanese towns have such a unique flair, 100% something I want to experience someday.
4:26 black shirt buddies
Ryotaro: Poor gaijin, can not even slup properly!
Bears tend to have parasites. Any concerns of that in Japan?
Hi abroad it seems there is someone thing missing in your life i hope u find it in due time....
Of the countless videos I've watched on this channel this one in particular makes me want to book a trip to Japan immediately.  If I ever do find myself fortunate enough to visit Japan, the Nakasendo Trail will absolutely be on my itinerary.
Chris’s wife has really gained her weight after they met
All the towns look exactly the same 😮
Omg how freaking creepy is that bear? And how is it going? Omg nightmares!
A bath without Connor @CDawgVA? Blasphemy!
Beautiful scenery such a good video the editing has leveld up i enjoyed it thank you Chris.
Ryotaro: SLURP!!  Japan: 👀
Black walls have a strong energy
Id stay in the black cosy room it looks more safe :) and the area looks beautiful wouldn't be eating a bear though sorry
Look at that pig talking. Can't understand a single thing about the Asian culture, wisdom and EDUCATION!
Editing felt a little different this time - more fast paced than usual? Not a bad thing, just something I picked up on. Felt like a lot less "downtime" where the footage is allowed to speak for itself.
Super channel 👍👍Add hungarian subtitles to the channel plz plz.🇭🇺🇭🇺🇭🇺🇭🇺👋👋👋
Honestly, almost everything looks better in the rain especially any sort of greenery. The darker/deeper green colours just seems so much lush.   Also, this is easily one of my favourite videos you've recently put out. The scenery is beautiful and Ryotaro is hilarious. Hopefully, it gets far more views as well.
Mr Slurp, like Hannibal Lecter.
Amazing Sharchrisro!
God damn i love Ryotoro, hes just too damn funny
How did you pay if you had no money?
I was just looking at that
dude, next time i want to see the brothels.. f.k the mountain scednery .. the montains wont go any were.. the brothels .. do :D
"she loves my slurp" I am dead.
How many young people live there though? Everyone seems to be older. And a village with no kids, has no future.
Hidden? Not very hidden anymore
The urge to travel every time I watch your videos gets so much stronger. Thanks for cool videos like this Chris!!!
Who goes anywhere in Japan without cash??
Booked a night in Magome for next month. The next day I see this. Can't wait!
the adventures of Sharla, MR affable and MR fallible!
I really love these travel videos, especially where you visit old villages. So it's indeed a shame they seem to be doing not as well as they used to.
Looking good Chris.
If they had no money what did they do for being able to pay for things? 😮
Absolutely beautiful! Thank you for bringing us along. 😎
started watching, turned off as soon as you came up with the no car virtue bollocks,
10:43   .... I got a strange feeling of Deja Vu
I nearly choked on my sweet tea when Ryotaro said his wife loves his slurp! 🤣😭🙈  Jokes aside, this is such a beautiful video! I love it when you guys walk around different parts of Japan, enjoy the scenery and environment, and taste the local cuisine 😋 I can almost feel the atmosphere! Looking forward to more of your content, Chris ✌🏼✨
Amazing video! I appreciate the research and documentary style you do your videos in. The balance with your humor and artistic style are such a treat. Someone else voice on this video wouldn't hold the same charm. Thank you for sharing this experience with us. I loved this video.
How is the last ryokan called, please?
This is just beautiful, I hope one day I can travel there, it looks so relaxing
why is the color a bit wierd on this video?
Ow u fat again
love it
Justice delicious
Welp, one more reason to go to Japan. How dare you make me want to go there?! 😂 This was just so calming and gorgeous. I love mushrooms too so I’m here for all the food and gorgeous pictures.  And I’m happy to see Ryotaro back😁😁
God it looks so beautiful 😭❤
mentions Sharlas channel, but not Risottoros, that's why he is sending bears and ninja after you to kill you off
You look more and more Japanese each video. Eventually, you're gonna look like an anime character.
@4:52 that was so powerful, you could use it in a video game
That bear crossing the room was unexpected and hilarious!!!
5:59 Aww.... Sharla gets her own room. How thoughtful XD
Welp, that's on my must go list....  Thank you for showing these places!!! ❤️ Absolutely gorgeous 🥰 oh and the food too.
Inazuma Genshin IRL
🧐😲
This episode was edited so well!
Gorgeous video Chris! thank you for sharing another wonderful area of Japan with us❤
Did Sharla have an okay time finding meatless dishes? I'd love to see some of the more mushroom-centric food. When I went to Tokyo it was fine finding vegan food in the cities but as soon as I left the cities it became infinitely harder.
How old are these guys
I enjoy this kind of videos the most! Please do more videos like that! ^o^
Not followed in a bit. Are Chris and Sharla dating?
I'm wondering if that bear was a local celebrity.
Chris, you know you can't show a bathtub without using your Connor-bathtub scale
I will always love your travel videos!
Wait did you just say they don't take credit card and nobody brought cash and just skipped a story of how you got out of there?
this guy makes Japan look great but doesn't tell you dark side of racist the country is China and South Korea is actually better.
Japan is just a paradise😍
Imagine dating and not bathing together.
Chris! Been watching for eight years🤘 The bear and ninja really put a playful edge on this video. Plus the 69 innuendo 😁 Good stuff!
MORE RYOTARO TRAVEL VIDEOS
You have to visit Koyasan, south of Osaka. Or the art islands of Naoshima or Teshima. Plenty cool content to be made there
I like Ryotaro's swanky walk. 😄
Showing off your budget with that bear CGI huh?
Bath with Aboard would be a good podcast
5:45 sharla knows
Always fantastic to watch and discover. ‘She loves my slurp!’ Can not be unheard …😳😄
I used to follow a Canadian outdoorsman who killed and ate bears. I asked him what the meat tasted like, and he said "Very good beef."
I know you have probably seen most of them but I would love to see more wacky weekend videos in love hotels.
Hear me out, the new podcast, abroad in a bath
Something really special about your videos that you never get from watching streams and in some cases other Ytubers, everything feels Japan is kind of the same thing, arcade, ramen and anime  after awhile you tend to not care about visiting/watching Japan videos but when I watch your videos it's so refreshing and I fall back in love with Japan. 💗
I stayed in Magome during my first trip to Japan and it was truly magical. I didn't know much about the hiking trail there but after seeing this I have to go back sometime and experience it in full.
This is an awesome tradtional place in Japan thanks for the showcase
abroad in japan? you’d think, like, half of ‘em would be broads
Loved it! Those are my favorite types of videos! Also this one looks really good. Different than your usual videos. Is this filmed on a different camera or is it different color-grading??
Kampai!
Another great video!!
Nice one on the bear in the background! And the ninja. 👍
Real title of the video: I Escaped to Japan's HIDDEN Mountain Village with my two wifes
So bear meat is typically quite tough and gamey, sort of fatty really. The ageing process is essential for making it take less overpowering, and the boiling process help incorporate the fat into a thin broth evenly distributing the flavor! It's difficult to find decent tasting bear outside of places like this in Japan, or Siberian locations. Absolutely fascinating stuff!!
Chris you were on top form for this one! Really made me laugh.  Have you used the record player?  “You bet I didn’t!” 😂
The highlight of this video is that bear. And that ninja.
Leaving for japan in a few years definitely gonna hike up this!
I knew I recognised that street in Naraijuku! I used it as a gorgeous scene backdrop in a Pathfinder Society 1st edition scenario. Love that Chris gets to show me more of it. Ryotaro was definitely channeling my old fellows playing mahjong NPCs.  Keep up the attempts on Chris's life, Ryotaro! :D I think you nearly got him with "She loves my slurp". ;)
8:40 the main dish of the room def. is Risottoro
Absolutely stunning, a great way to see old Japan. Thank you for sharing 😊
Fantastic video Chris! The traditional Japanese villages look so beautiful. ❤
My boys are back together for another fantastic video!
The bear edit got me haha
I think that’s where wolverine got shot up with arrows
i was very impressed by that bear walking behind them in the restaurant
I feel like Sharla is third wheeling
P.S I love Ryotoro!
.... was that car playing too much volcano 🤣🤣
I love seeing all tree of u in one video 😁
Old school AIJ 🙌🏼
Video has more of a classic Abroad in Japan vibe. 10/10 would watch again.
No, please don't say that videos like these don't do well, they're my favourite type of content from you
How about go to an island in the archipelago of japan for a change like Tsushima
Ryotaro's british accent impression was spot on
This would be the perfect kind of video to share with my parents, but their English is not so great :( they love documentaries, and your content always reminds me of documentaries back in the day. Maybe one day, someone will make German subs :D   But regardless, always appreciate your content Chris!!!
"She  love's my Slurp" - Ryotoro, 2023
It's great to see Rissoto back. My favorite videos are always the documentaries and the ones in which Rissoto tries to ki... uhh show you around Japan.
the bear lmao
Chris do you like Tabasco sauce?
❤❤❤❤
I literally just got back from a trip consisting of Nagano(incl magome), Osaka, and Tokyo(Shibuya etc) - to see Chris do videos in both areas I went. Funny about the credit card comment though, I paid for my dinner by card
can we have a Dr. Slurpee meets Dr. Jelly special? thanks Chris!
Really enjoyed this!
Healthy and tasty Japanese food. 🤤
I'm loving the more informative videos like the days of old! Thank you!!!
nothing can beat Mr Slurpee's comment
"A certain meat, that might be an acquired taste"  *Cuts to Ryotaro*  Because of course...
Keep'em coming bruv 👍
Abroad in japan videos not making me feel like buying a ticket and go to japan right away CHALLENGE : IMPOSSIBLE
Oh my god this looks so stunning. I may need to add this to my travel plans.
Can't believe they were smelling each other's wood in their rooms
Never stop making these content. It's inspiring a lot of us to visit Japan, and not the usual Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka route.
I'm sure I've seen a video of Chris saying how important carrying cash is in Japan? Did I imagine it? Did he forget his own rules AGAIN?  In other news; rumours that Paddington, Pooh, Yogi, Booboo, and Rupert, have hired a hitman remain unconfirmed at this time.
10:54 aaaand... we won't have Abroad in China anymore.
Oh I did the same section as this video a few years ago. It was great, onsens every night and beautiful sights all day.
Man it's good to see a travel video with Chris and Ryotaro again. It's been a while, honestly kind of nostalgic. I've missed seeing Ryotaro more often in these.
just me or do slices of bear look like underpants???
06:50 - I bet you would have played the record player if you had a vinyl of Too Much Volcano!
I'd go with Chris' room solely because I can't stand steep stairs. They freak me out.
nice video
awesome video as always but..... has anyone noticed the way Chris acts in front of the camera since these year's video uploads compared with last year? More natural, no forced jokes, no rushed feeling of having to say something silly or awkward in each shot.....just more natural overall
Love this kind of videos, keep up the good work!
いつも日本を紹介してくれてありがとう！
Your videos are amazing! Please make longer videos<333
A hotel room with good pour over coffee equipment? A nice touch.
You and Ryotaro are getting along for some reason. I'm starting to think you might be friends
I love these types of videos <3  adnd now I think it's a shame I left out that trail on my last japan trip due to the time limit.. gladfully the country lowered the restrictions for tourists :)
Affable all the way!
Cash is king!
I love these kind of videos! And I think one can really see how much effort goes into making these. They let me dream of the time I can finally go and explore the country myself :) Thank you for the effort :)
Nice move on 0:55
Did anyone spot a bear? ahahahha
So beautiful & picturesque - and such clean air. X
Chris is really looking extra affable nowadays. Must be all that chess boxing.
Chris is looking so healthy, great work brother.
Looking at Crhis on this video and Chris 6 months ago 7 months ago really shows the progress he's made on his weight loss journey. Look at that fantastic figure he has in the 7 minute mark!
Looking very fit Chris!! Nice to see your progress
At the start of the video I was like, where is this? This can’t be Nagano because it’s winter and everyone’s skiing/snowboarding now. Chris says Nagano. Well, this was obviously filmed in autumn!
Eating while watching Abroad in Japan is a must do.
Nice of Chris to bring his SO along on this trip, and Sharla of course
I want Chris to go to Kyoto and interview Shigeru Miyamoto and ask him to get some info about Tears of the Kingdom
I mean, the favorite food of a musical icon is still culture. Just more popular culture than traditional.
Chris, your content is relatable, fascinating and fun. I really enjoy your videos and you give me ideas of places to visit every time I visit Japan. Thank you! 🙌🏻
I love these type of videos, including the last one, where you just discover another wonderful bit of Japan.
Anyone in the comments a fan of phelous? Dinner interupting bear!@@!
Really looking forward to the next wacky weekend style show on this channel. The Adventures of Mr. British, and Mr Slurpee!!!
When are we going to get the Dr Jelly vs Mr Slurpee showdown?
Amazing video. Two really beautiful towns. Enjoy watching things like this a lot
i did that walk but magome was my start point !! it was an amasing one except it was august(very bad idea indeed)
lets start a poll of favorite baby names.
Hey Chris, loved the video and couldn't help but notice the amazing autumn colours. When was this? I've been pondering and considering an autumn trip to Japan, and I'm trying to pin down what time would be the best for the monsoon season to be  safely over and the colours to be in full bloom. Also yes please for more travel videos, they're what got me hooked on your channel and they're the next best thing to actually traveling there myself!
And once again, they sat the wrong way around and were bumping elbows while eating. I thought the last video was the start of you both remembering to sit the other way!! We all had so much faith!!! You let us down!!! xD All kidding aside, I love these videos exploring places like this and showing them. They are so beautiful!!
Awesome video! Come to Okinawa and hang out :)
I would love to see you do a series on traditional or non traditional Japanese crafts and the places where they do it.
Mr Affable, is the 🐐
Quite rude of Sharla to intrude on Chris and riyotoro's date
Great video as always.
Love these kind of videos, much more interesting than the ones of some extreme sport or eating contest. Really well made!
IT'S NOT AUTUMN!!!! "CHRIS" "BROAD" LIES AGAIN!
Thanks!
Absolutely stunning, the black wood is spectacular. I will definitely visit it when I come to japan.
Laughed out loud at that bear 😄
Chris Broad just lost 420 social credits when he called the bear meat as Winnie the Pooh. 😂
for a split second the bear scared the hell outta me
If you slurp like Risottero all the Ladies will fight for your attention
Awalk in Japan is now my favorite thing!
Man, that bear walking in the background really cracked me up
Chris love your vids from India  Just what you need after a tiring day after school
Comment
Mr British and Mr Slurps. Is it 48 hours walking incl car ride?
I think you feel guilty for eating bear because they're useally endangered, but if the local population is healthy and thriving I don't think it's an issue to sustainably hunt or cul them, especially since they have massive territories and could end up fighting if not done
Lol, funny how Mr Miyagi sounded a lot like Natsuki.. Very beautiful areas in this vid. Thank you for sharing it with us Chris, Sharla, & Ryotaro.
Sheesh them ninja and bear effects 😂💅
Haha whats wrong with you? Going somewere in japan without cash?? That's just stupid =P How did you get out of that predicament?
"Favourite thing in Japan" - Broad statement innit? :D
Loved this!
These travel videos are one of my favorite types of your videos, so I hope you don't stop doing them completely on account of the algorithm suppressing them or the broader audience not connecting with them!
Mr Slurpy and Mr British, together again, and it feels so good! This was hilarious 😂😂  14:24 Waaait, if you couldn't pay by card, no one brought cash and there wasn't any ATMs, how did you pay for that meal?? Did you just walk out lol
I live right next to Magome and visiting during covid was amazing. Not a single other person on the streets.
An Abroad in Japan video with Ryotaro where Ryotaro doesn't try to kill Chris through some wacky misadventure? I call shenanigans, sir! I demand a refund!
16:27 - Looks like an early scene from a horror movie where the unsettling, theatrical man you're renting a room from first welcomes you.
You feel more guilty about eating bear, compared to beef? There is some sense in feeling a bit of guilt, about eating domesticated animals: Animals born and raised to be eaten (who only exist, for us to eat), and who are often mistreated and kept and transported in bad conditions ...but there is no reason to feel guilty about, sensibly and sustainably hunted, wild game.
Oh man charlotte is a jets fan?? That’s a rare thing these days
**bear casually walking in the background** LMAO!
Just curious, what did you guys do since none of your guys had cash 😂  Btw, thank you for another amazing video! Never thought about visiting Magome until now
Thank you for the awesome video~ I love to see videos like this exploring Japan, Thank you for bringing us all along for the trip, I hope it was an amazing experience Thank you for your hard work, Keep it up m(_ _)m  (Also glad to see Ryotaro again for the first time in a while)  I hope everyone is having a lovely day, Have a wonderful rest of your week, Be safe and Take care out there wherever you are (^=W=^)7
Respect to Paul Ballard.  Awesome job matching that classic Abroad In Japan feel while still injecting personality into the editing style in a subtle way.   ABROAD IN JAPAN WATCHERS WE ARE ABOUT TO BE EATING GOOD FAM!  THE GREAT ABROAD IN JAPAN ERA HAS BEGUN!
I've missed these kind of videos so much. Just you and a guest (especially Ryotaro) showing us different views of Japan you typically don't see.  MORE RYOTARO
I love the chemistry between you and your boyfriend Ryotaro. Very nice of you to bring him on such lovely trip.
Another top tier video Chris! Loving these walking/fitness-related videos so so much. It always brightens my day to see a new upload from you, especially this close to each other! Also 10:20 was a missed opportunity to edit the word "LAFFABLE" on top of Ryotaro haha
lookin great bruv
loved the chill tone and atmosfere of the vid. insanely well made and composed, should do these more often
🐻
Is the cam he uses the vlog cam in the descreption? if so its a steal perfect cam for vlogging.
No idea how you record the sound, either is very quiet there or the recording/editing is perfect.
It's just me and you and you and me.... and your friend Ryotaro *doot doo doo* Ryotaro
My good Sir, could you please make these videos a little bit longer? 🥺
I'm not surprised that Lennon's favourite ice cream wasn't ice cream but soft serve.  Yeah add as much flavours to it as you want...Soft Serve is $hit & has nothing to do with real ice cream.  I woke up recently and haven't had any coffee yet.  Not gonna retract what I've written though.
We got Joey as Dr. Jelly. Now it is time for Ryotaro to become Mr. Slurpy
Not trying to start anything But Sharla seems to be glowing 🤔 🤰
I can just imagine Norm doing the Leo DiCaprio-meme where he's pointing at the screen...
I wouldn’t of gone down a dirty road with that slurp but your outburst set me off. You’ve dirtied me.
new podcast: Bathing Broad™️
Horse, bear, puffer fish… what’s next?
I was kind of hoping you were going to tell me John Lennon's favorite ice cream was John Lemon.
hi Chris, when was this video shot? in the fall? it cannot be that warm now in this area, right?
This brought back good memories ☺️. I made the walk from Tsumago to Magone in 2009. With lack of transportation options back to Tsumago we were offered a ride back to our minshuku in his mini-van by a local farmer.
is it just me? or someone also noticed that there is a forest golem at 20:36?.
20:52 That is a very handsome 300 year old man 🙂
Hey Chris I have recently gotten into watching sumo! What are some of your opinions on sumo?
Nice Job
Chris, another outstanding video. Please never stop, you are such a natural in front of the camera and I love your storytelling. We need more of those walking-tour videos!! Love from NZ
sinister is chris favorite word
How does your editing and camera work keep getting better every video!?
so happy to see risottoro again!
This was so refreshing! Hope you make more videos like this! And you and Sharla are so cute together!
Absolutely stunning views! I almost died of laughter when the bear crawled behind you :D
Thankful that you shared your trip to these hidden towns along the trail.  It’s similar to the Cinque Terra in Italy. 👍🙏😎
Such a good video! I loved the bear and the ninja walking being you guys 😂
Chris’ room!
wowowowoww
You wanted romantic, why wasn't ryotaro the camera man then?
ryotaro in every good tourist spot Connor in every love hotel Pete will be always the pack mule joey And natsuki in every vacation destination  Pete has the short straw
Love your content
...do you think they ("we") should take back their island? now it´s the time he got no men left to fight on that other side
"She loves my slurp." - Ryotaro, Autumn 2022
My Japanese girlfriend says Ryotaro speaks like C3PO xDD  Great video btw, always love watching them :)
when i grow up i wanna be just like you and albo
I really love the videography in this one!!!
I adore than you're a channel about Japan that's not focused on Anime. It's nice to learn things about the ACTUAL culture of the country every now and then
a few more places to add to my "must see" list
Is this the same post town trail Tokyo Lens did?
Saw Ryotaro and waited patiently for the usual attempted murder 😌
'She loves my slurp'. Oh  my god 😂
Where is my intro music 🎶?
"She loves my slurp." Ryotaro just effing SENDS ME
When I read the title, I thought Chris went to Konoha or something.
The production quality on these videos is INSANE! Thank you for all your hard work and keen attention to detail showing us life in Japan.
I hope if you did any video back home, that you add those also so we can watch.
It's not that it doesn't do well -- these city walks are wonderful videos. I think people just knew you were on vacation and didn't know when you'd be back.  Now that we all know you've returned from the UK, people will start watching again.  Shinpai nai kudasai.
“She loves my slurp” - Ryotaro
why did i just watch a short where they showed bear worms and why you shouldn't eat bear meat XD yikes
Incredible video Mr. Broad
Got a cold ? Voice sounds deeper n a bit nasaly
So beautiful
This is such a beautiful place
Okay that steamed meat filled bun....drool.
The absolute Britpanese chaos of this experience that you've shared with us fills me with determination.
Chris you're my favorite creator and i don't just mean for youtube. Hands down across everything....shows, movies all of it. The style of shows, the content, the quality of the video and editing are so....beautifully done. Thank you.
It really is like stepping into another time
Gosh those rooms are absolutely gorgeous. They look so luxurious, i love the dark color scheme.
The egg in the noodles gives it a carbonara type consistency. Creamy almost. Looks good
I don't understand why youtube doesn't promote these travel type vids as much as others. These are my favorite!
Just an observation about your... umm, slurping dilemma, Chris. Try with less noodles. I noticed in one of your early videos you were trying with a rather large amount compared to Ryotaro and the other gentleman you were with, so it's no wonder they can quickly slurp them up with little effort... but it seems they never explained that to you, perhaps for their own amusement.
Counterpoint: Paddington has been marinating in marmalade for decades. He is probably S-tier food material, honestly
Does Japanese bear not have Trichinella?
Chris dude! You look soooo good!!!!! Congrats on your fitness journey really paying off, inspiring stuff!
Love these travel videos, Brilliant.
It's nice seeing Chris with a girlfriend XD.
Thank you so much, you really do make the most beautiful, wondrous parts of Japan accessible to all of us who love it and crave knowledge about it. My life is genuinely improved by your content.
Picked up a little verbal tick there Christ, right? Gotta turn it left, right? Indeed.
Costca coffe like they drink 200 years ago 😂
currently saving money  just so I could one day visit ginzan onsen villege 🥲
Sniffing wood eh... lol
I'm a photography major in college rn and were doing landscape photos rn and man sometimes I really wish I lived in Japan I feel like there's so many beautiful places and landscapes there like there aren't many places around me in the detroit Michigan metro area unless I want to go on a road trip which most of the me and my boyfriend don't have cuz were broke college students
I did the Tsumago-Magome section of the trail with a girlfriend about 15 years ago. Was a glorious experience. And… one of the Minshuku (traditional bed and breakfast) that we stayed included some special items in the Teishoku (meal on a tray). Basashi and Inago—- raw horse meat and fried locust😮
Risotto man is so wholesome
Walking the Nakasendo, Chris? Hardly.  Having lived in this area for the last 20 plus years, I wouldn't recommend anyone walking between any of these postal towns as the very busy main road is a total nightmare.  The towns are lovely though but can get very crowded during the holidays and weekends and the car parks are expensive.
Oh shit, Ryotaro has a channel!  Nice.  How the fuck don't these videos do better? They are literally a Unesco heritage thing, preserving and educating on culture
comment to boost view rate
Love the travel videos, very inspiring to get to know some of the less known beautiful places in Japan and totally visited some of the things you have done in past videos. Also went to Narai Juku with some friends last year in the same ryokan and it was amazing!
I love travel videos!
It’s the whole set of people not just one that makes Abroad in Japan enjoyable. Really fun to see familiar and new faces and the quality of videos given.
Looking forward to the new podcast: Abroad in a Bath
🤣 new channel name/retirement plan!... traveling forever until passing on..and call it abroad around the globe 🤣👍👍.
Love seeing the travel videos and the beautiful views in more hidden trails of Japan!
I walked the Magome to Tsumago section of the Nakasendo in December, and it was very beautiful. Mountains, waterfalls, a very old tea house, and even little bells you can ring to scare off the bears!  If I could do it, I'm sure an accomplished athlete like you would have no problem.
While I wish the consumption of all meat would end (I don't eat mammals, but I am not a vegan or vegetarian -- would like to be one day if I can ever afford to give up the little meat I do consume without having to live solely on rice and beans), it's not entirely hypocritical to feel guilty for eating a bear but not cattle. Cattle are, sadly, raised to be slaughtered for our tastebuds. Most animals raised for meat don't have the best lives and are therefore being put out of their misery when they are killed. When it comes to other animals, especially ones that aren't raised for our desire to consume meat, they're just out there living their lives naturally and minding their own business when someone with a weapon comes along and kills them. This not only leads to the death of an animal in a very unnatural way, but we're either taking away the food of an animal that actually needs meat (humans can easily survive without it, as we can find the things that are in meat that we do need in other ways, unlike other animals which actually do need meat to survive), or we're taking away the natural predators of other animals whose populations wouldn't "need" our involvement to control their population if we didn't kill their natural predators. Not to mention nearly every place in the world has been conditioned to see eating beef as normal, whereas few places eat things like bear on the regular basis.
I love that trail.   Just so beautiful.  There is someone who offers free tea as you are walking. Once saw a woman drying sweet potatoes.  Never stayed overnight so it was great to see the inside.  Next time.
Been missing your videos! Thanks for the motherlode this week!
You are looking great Chris and seem a lot happier. Keep up the great work!
We walked from Magome to Tsumago a few years back.  Unfortunately just a day trip from Nagoya but fantastic nonetheless.  We were there in Winter but would love to go back during other seasons. The views along the way are spectacular and the villages are both amazingly beautiful and welcoming.
Thank you for showing the world a side of Japan people like to pretend doesn't exist. I love videos like these that show what the country side is like. Looking forward to more hiking/walking videos this year
The thumbnail gives off mid 2000s romantic comedy vibes
Always a pleasure to have a new Abroad in Japan video. Didn't expect two in a week.
Loving the exploring videos
Chris eat Pork Bun. He is whole man now!
Maybe it could be that Japan is more accessible to travelers than south korea is. maybe it could be for other reasons unknown to me, and I'll welcome thoughts about this dynamic dance between Korea and Japan. Being a local Korean in Hawai'i our culture is very heavily "Japanified" more so in the sense of the state's active public cultural events tend to run an annual circuit of Japanese culture that disregards the other cultures of Hawaii with the example of the Obon Season as to where enough, the Honolulu summer lantern festival is purely dictated by the shinto church. I respect your exploration of cultures west of hawaii, However I feel you have fallen for the capturation of Japanese culture as a potential superior to other western asian cultures. You enjoy finding experience in the Japanese culture but what about being objective to the other cultures adjacent to Japan that bring insight to the western asian arena?
I enjoy these videos. I'm hoping my next big trip will be Japan so it's nice to see what's out there... Even then, there's a lot of stuff I just won't have the time to see, so at least I can get a bit of a look here.
was that a miata
Ah I know the joys of a female best friend, those two could rock it either way.
Sorry Chris. Your Sleeping area looks like a jail cell with paintings. I have to go with Riataro's.
This was great thanks Chris
I remember Food Wars having an entire episode or two dedicated to bear meat.
These are the best, Tokyo videos are great and all but you never see this and with Chris as host 🤌🤌🤌
ryatoro's room, i prefer it, more japanese :)
Risotoro - Best. British accent. Ever !
16:38 im so high.. this moment is soo random...
Loved this video! It’s comforting, educational and just great to watch! And as one who edits videos for work, great editing!!
Did you get a new camera or lens? It seems like the quality has improved even more, or maybe I have been watching too much trash taste
Faffable room, it feels like a rustic Japanese cabin or something
My guess is the meat is human, I haven’t gotten to it yet but it’s my guess
Everything was so beautiful, it would be a nice place to visit  This Video gets 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 🤗 👍🙏
It's a Beautiful place to go to, but a question? You said the three of all of you didn't have any cash on you. So My question is how did you pay for everything? 🤗👍
2:05 that walk of Ryotaro is so sassy lmao
Chris... We will meet some day. Remember this....
At last Ryotaro is back, kinda missed him.
These are a pleasure to watch + We got Ryotaro and Sharla
Slurping in Japan means they love that ramen, perfectly acceptable
Fantastic video - like a magic
"Too Much Volcano!" plays from the car @1:17, as Chris complains about cars occupying rural streets. Didn't he say he drove????
Thank you for the continually visually stunning videos that make me long to return to Japan, Chris.
This brings back so many memories! I did this trail the last time I was in Japan. This and Miyama are definitely my favorite spots in Japan (so far). If you ever get the chance to do this, I recommend using the luggage service that transport your bags from Magome to Tsumago. There is a 1.5 hour hike that you can take between the two towns that really spits you out in nature. There are even bear bells all along the trail! Definitely recommend! Can't wait to go back
This is by far my favorite area you have highlighted in Japan. Many people associate Japan with futuristic technology, but I love the history and nature. More please!
When I imagine a trip to Japan, this is the mental image I get of tranquil exploration. The calmness and beauty is poetic. While I feel the major cities are what I would end up seeing, this experience is what I would long for.
10:20 Shitt i read that Fapable at a glance
Mr Slurpy would make an awesome shirt and Villain for Dr Jelly to battle
I have actually never had the desire to visit Japan.  But after watching so many of your videos showcasing both the good and the bad, I am in the budgeting and planning process of making the excursion to this land of unlimited beauty!  And this coming from a Canadian!!  Wonderful objectivity Chris.  Thank you.
Those earth walls will be poo and straw. Do not lick.
All I think is, poor poor Pete, after he's forced to be a backpack carrier in tokyo, the next video is this Hayao Miyazaki esque trails
the wood is dark from a fire treating process that strengthens the wood and preserves it longer so villages can save materials and time by repairing less frequently.
Amazing video, is this filmed with the Sony A7S iii or is this the Panasonic Lumix g85?
That hotel room is bigger than my apartment 🤦‍♂️
I love the colour edit on this video. A real vibe. And I love videos like these is general
I love the ninja and the bear in the background!😂👌🏾
Thank you. I used your video as background noise while eating dinner.
Absolutely stunning, thank you for sharing! These are the kind of adventures I want to do whenever I visit Japan.
As someone who’s special interest is Japan, thank you Chris for posting these videos. Always such high quality and a familiar face I can watch when feeling down. Wishing you (and Sharla!) all the best in the future Abroad in Japan endeavors!!! Sending endless support from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania!🤍🍜🍡🇯🇵
You make me wish I would have had my honeymoon here 🤩 so quaint and beautiful scenery!
I know what I must do now if I ever go to Japan.  I have to hike that trail
MMMMMMMMM bear.
Great video. While I enjoy the vast majority of the content Chris puts out, it's videos like this that I'm especially fond of. Simple travel and discovery in beautiful and unique places.
Love your videos but they generally don't help My travel fever even though i'm going to Japan in summer. Too many places I want to visit but only 3 weeks to do it all Sadge. Any tips on where are the must to visit places overall?
Great video!
I really enjoy these. Please keep showing these hidden gems.
Loving these types of videos and enjoy all the information around it. Definitely added to my potential list of travel destinations!
Cool this is the type of YouTube that should be trending
I'm glad to see more videos for it make my day better.
You look so good man!!
Really love it when you show us the sights xx
Banger video
2:30 That's some @Junk Food Japan editing style right there
The fact that an rx-7 or possibly a miata pulled out into the shot made it just that much better. There is nothing more japanese than that. 👍
Top notch content. Nakasendo Trail is one of the areas I most want to visit when I get to Japan finally.  The only thing I worry about is hotels/Ryokan having issues with same sex couples in more rural areas. I know most love hotels seem to have an issue, I wonder if rural areas are the same?
Gimmi a studio out there with good internet.. i'll be juicin for life baby
She loves my slurp. It's 5 am here I was not ready for this 😅
I would by a shirt with Ryotaro's face on it and says Got Slurp? Pls do make one.
"wax on wax off F*** off" By Natsuki. lol 🤣
"She likes my slurp" We need that on merch right away please XD
I weirdly didn’t see this video until I actively searched up Abroad in Japan on YouTube, and I have notifications for all of your new videos.   I would love to see more of these travel videos ! It really gives me different ideas on where to travel to when I eventually visit Japan!
Two video's in one week??  This is absurd!
I love the travel videos! Every time I watch one I wish I was there! They show you places you wouldn’t exactly think to go to either.
Your travelogues are art, love this sort of video!
you guys ate bear-dong? EDIT: I went back and listened and there is no 'g' of course... almost though, almost.
really loved this, the mix of history; the lore; the visuals. keep um coming
Staying in a 400yr old house would be so cool!!
Podcast with mister Slurpy..*snickers warmly*
Just yesterday, a made the decision to plan another trip to Japan next year in the warmer months (just got back from skiing there) and do the Nakasendo trail, and then this drops!
9:35 no thank you
Mr slurpy is my favorite person ever
My neck of the woods! 👍👍 Also maybe I'm mistaken but isn't the thing Sharla was eating おやき、not まん? They're usually grilled and filled with veg like eggplant, nozawana, or pumpkin.  Also, I can't believe the rookie move of not carrying cash in Japan. 😉
7:40 Ryotaro with some mischievous plan 😂
You know, I was actually grinding my coffee when the coffee grinding scene came up 😂
Ryatoro’ I missed you
I live in the mountains and love when it rains. Really makes natures colors pop. Especially the green. Love the video!
If I go to Japan, I might choose to accommodate at Ryotaro's room. While Chris's room looks cozy, the store room  uniqueness is appealing.
another great video by dave in japan!
Comment for the algorithm
Having Too Much Volcano play as if the passing car was listening to it was a great touch 1:15
Not sure how I feel about the region being prosperous because of the daimyo constantly travelling
British cat and Japanese dog on vacation. Same vibe lol
Dude.. Natsuki's Mr. Miyagi is ON POINT!! Hahahahahaha. 13:52
now now, we need to see conor & rissottoro in the same video 🤣
It is very picturesque, and it reminds me of some mountain villages in the Alps in Switzerland, with wooden buildings and houses... the difference being that it's traditional Japanese architecture.
Ryotaro the 3rd wheels.
I’m starting to think Sharla and Chris are an item. Getting them vibes.
It's so nice of you to have invited Sharla on the trip to hold the umbrella for you! I bet she felt privileged. Hell, you even got her her own room separate from you and Ryotaro. Nice!
Ryotoro said it was the least stunning because Chris was on it.
Why are you being all nice Chris? Its obvious that none of you liked the last house really yet so polite! Geez. What have you done with the real Chris Broard?
The Man, The Myth, The Legend, Slurpman Ryotaro is back with another assassination attempt on Chris! Great video as always!
Still trying to get another £20 from Too Much Volcano…
I have never understood the raw egg thing please explain
only one drone from swarm *heartheartheart*
Oh snap I live like 30 minutes away from Narai-juku!  Can confirm, Nagano's "shinshu" soba is the best I've had in Japan.  The valley that holds the Nakasendo, Kiso valley, is probably one of my favorite hidden gems, so many villages and places to discover.  Hope y'all get a chance to explore more of Nagano in the future!
this video had some of the most aesthetically pleasing shots ive ever seen. the last one was also just as beautiful im loving 2023 AIJ :D
Chris is looking handsome as heck in these thumbnails lately.  That year of health consciousness is showing.  Cheers.
youtube money treating you well i see chris
13:45 you guys finally sat to the correct side of the table!!!
your videos are so good chris. amazing stuff.  i feel like it your just getting better and better.
Sharmander absorbed all of Chris' lost weight
Taking good influence from Tokyo lens and then some
I've never noticed that your left-handed as so am I. Every time I use chopsticks people get confused that I use my left hand.
The bear cracked me up! Really enjoyed this.
Thank you for showing me another place to add to my list to see. How is there not a “ she likes my slurp” shirt?
Really beautiful colour correction on this film, Chris. And a fantastic video otherwise.
14:36 >lives in Japan for 10 years >forgets that it's a cash-based society
oh beautiful. Every bit of it, even the random bears and ninjas and slurping. XD
Liked for the return of Risottoro
Ryotaro’s british accent caught me off guard lol
Chris Broad's (not so) Bizarre Adventure   =To be continued=>
Guys... Chris has had Sex... I can tell. He is no longer a Virgin
Winnie the Shabu
Another certified banger
If I were more confident with the language, this is definitely the kind of Japanese vacation I would love.  Out of the big cities, in the mountains, beautiful scenery, and authentic and historic towns.  So awesome.
Want more walk and talk videos like this,Chris.
Finally some more videos within a smaller amount of timeeee, genuinely my fav channel to watch by far!
Awesome video! Makes me want to go back to Japan. Hopefully soon! 😄
i like video
We all know Sharla is the third wheel in the relationship between Dave and  Ryotoru
i love chris broad  lmaooo  forreal tho every video is fresh, not alot of youtubers can say that.  he has got the feel of a documentary mixed with the nice warm youtube humor, its best invention since bread and butter.
I liked that you showed a lot of meals, love to see it
Wow what a stunningly beautiful place
That bear passing by tho, my goodness, shocked me 😅😆
Forever my favorite youtuber and master storyteller of all time! Can't wait for more sir :)
Never thought id see Sharla wearing a NY team’s jersey 😂😂😂😂
Yes. More walking series!
Love Sharla being the thirdweel hahaha
Really appreciate all the hard work you put into these videos! Keep at it
I liked him more when he was angry and single
I don't know how long you've been putting kanji and explanations for niche Japanese things that foreigners may not encounter outside of Japan. I've been studying Japanese for about a year independently, and this little bit of editing is greatly appreciated.  Sidenote, when I finally get to Japan, this might be an entire week of my itinerary.
Brilliant video and not an ounce of CGI in sight
Without Connor splashing about is it really a proper bath ?
god, the production quality on these videos always blows me away. makes me desperately want to visit japan some day. thank you for the hard work!
I've been a subscriber for many years. This was one of my very favorites. Well done!
Dr Jelly has a nemesis now..... Mr British 🤣
Keep up the good work Chris! Looking 💪
Your videos are like a window into Japan. Thanks for doing what you do!
Chris using the entire budget for that walking bear in the background
damn i totaly did not expect the video ending O_O i was like yeah nice good there is stil ahlf the vid left xD this was so well made i totaly did not noticed the time running by - lovely sscenery, lovely narration - it really is a very beautiful place
Another video already? You’re spoiling us Chris - great work as always!
That ryokan looks fantastic, holy smokes it’s ¥50,000 per person/night!
Where I come from, that outdoor tub would be known as a "trough."  With a human or two in there, it would probably attract those yummy local bears.
What I read and heard about those traditional storehouses is that because the wall is so thick and earthen, it maintains a steady comfortable temperature and humidity all year round... so the answer depends on when. xD
Thanks chris very pog
am going to be doing this in 40 days, I can't wait!!!
oh my days leave ryotoro at home next time plz
This is the content i originally subbed for, though i do love the Journey Across Japan series as well
CHRIS WATCH OUT A BEAR AND NINJA WAS BEHIND YOU!
Obligatory Youtube Algorithm boosting comment. Those were some nice shots, very relaxing to watch wit ha cup of tea.
I walked from Magome to Tsumago one day in spring a few years ago and it was one of the most picturesque days of my whole trip to Japan. They're not lying about the bears either, the whole walk has bells to ring to keep them away!
Chris, who has been posting travel vlogs for how many years: I need to get out more  Me, who's only been able to go on two genuine trips in the past 3.5 years: uh oh
just a recommendation chris, would it be possible to list the places you go to in the description. like an easy access link to google maps of all the places.
"she love my slurp" i lost it hahahaha
I learn japanese for a week and can read 30% of the ice cream sign
1:23 a miatiaaaaaaaaaaa
Let's pump the viewership numbers up. Love these videos. I almost cried every time I see the beautiful natural scenery.  Thank you Chris for bring me the joy!
FAFFABLE ROOM, definitely,  Great video, Great content 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Id feel safer in FAFFABLE.
I'm sad to hear these kinds of videos don't do as well as they used to. I really appreciate them and the quality of them is amazing. Keep it up Chris.   P.S. I would pick your room... despite the ugly coffee table.
Ah, these are always a relaxing watch.
OH MAN, Ryotaros english has gotten REALLY good
A really gorgeous video, all the architecture and nature was just absolutely stunning! Glad to see these types of videos again ❤
cup of tea🤣
So... How did you pay if they didn't accept credit cards? Using Dr. Jelly or something?
THE SLURP JOKE KILLED ME
I love these type of videos!! and the area looked absolutely stunning.
Obligatory comment to help with algorithm.
colors look fantastic
So glad Chris has focused back on YouTube. Glad he was able to focus on himself for a bit but YouTube needs Chris Broad!
let’s go 2 videos within a month you should stream a trip like this over a few days!
Great video! Thanks!
I love it, "MR. SLURPY." In the state where I grew up we had the home of the foot long weener called "MR. WEENIE." 😂😆🤣. It was a drive in and the servers would place the trays on your half open windows. That long secret garden looks like my grandma/obachan's home in Hachioji. Her home is now surrounded by parking lots, sadly.
The vibe..
Whether I'm right or not, I'm choosing to believe that rather than use AfterEffects or CGI for the bear, the whole team decided it would be funnier for Sharla to dress up and just shuffle past non -shar- chalantly
Now I found a reason to go to japan. John lennon favourite ice cream!!!
you should actually walk some of the road, now that youre all fit.  i went only to tsumago, it was wonderful indeed
Absolutely stunning! The trail will definitely be on my must-see list, if I make my way over to Japan!
Did Chris buy more new lenses? The visual quality here is astonishing... another step up. The colour depth is also noticeable... and the editing. 🤌
Watching Abroad in Japan finally in Japan. Thanks Chris for all the wonderful videos through the years.
Hey Chris, your videos always help me escape my busy life. I’m always stuck between my schoolwork and my cop-op work and these breaks are a life saver. Thanks for your amazing content ❤
I’m intrigued how they sorted the issue of eating lunch and then not being able to pay 😂 Did they have to wash the dishes in the kitchen that night?
That special effects scene with the bear must have taken hours to complete and clearly blew the film budget!
I love these kind of videos!! Japan so beautiful!!
So happy to see another video with Ryatoro. Dream team cast with gf and his greatest Frenemy.
Chris went with Sharla and went on more dates with Ryotaro
THIS! THIS IS PEAK CHRIS. Exploration,lore, food, a slurping Ryotaro!
The bear actually scared me holy moly hahaha
I really enjoy these kinds of videos :)
i think cris just brought sharla as a cameraman and the real date is with ryotaro.
that bedroom, with just a bed and three stools next to it facing it.... what the hell happened here?
I like how Sharla sneaked in the background while you were showing the bear meat.
Are you ok Chris?  Seem tired
I used to love Blue Peter. Chris, you are my new Triangle window. Thank you.
Chris has gotten hotter, noticed that since the Christmas vlogs.  💜Love it when you shoot content with Sharla!
Oh wow another Chris and Ryotaro driving and eating weekend, now there's a classic I've been craving!
Lucy in the sky with soft cream ?
love seeing ryotaro
Dayum.... I freaking love how cozy and beautiful Ryotaro's ryokan room is. I could stay in there for weeks easy.
Idk if it's just me but the color choice for this video feels different from the usual! It's higher contrast, I think? I'm curious if it was due to the different light in autumn/winter or just a stylistic choice, to me it feels a bit less realistic but it really makes the foliage and wood colors pop :) And these locations were extremely beautiful indeed, it must be extremely relaxing to take some days off and unplug from everything in the depths of the mountains
12:44 (ಠ ͜ʖಠ)
Love this one. Such gorgeous locations and really well showcased. Thanks Chris and all 🪴
1:23 Noooo!!! How could a Miata make you angry :(
Your cinematography skills just keep getting better , Camera Chris
400 hundred years ago when ryotaro was born.
Nikuman we have in the Netherlands as well. But we call it 'Broodje Bapau'
"She loves my slurp". ROFL.
Whoa! Just look at those ultra realistic special effects! I thought Sharla had become a ninja for a second there. 😉 Nice job editing! That place looks gorgeous.
Might be a good idea for the graphic to show the entire Nakasendo, then highlight the specific bit that you went to. Same with any of the other trails. The graphical presentation as is can be misleading.
Absolutely beautiful 😊
Need to live in that final house at least once
For me this was one of your best videos, absolutely loved it. If I ever end up taking the family to Japan this is where we're going.
Definitely Faffable, there is something about the 1 1/2 floor setting that I just love. Maybe someday I would be able to articulate it.
Is no one going to talk about the bear behind em
I love the fact John Lennon endorsed that ice cream, maybe Yoko influenced him?
Amazing and Gay
"Because of my slurp" LOL
Video ruined as soon as i saw the Evil sharmander.
I enjoy these, and good seeing Ryotaro as well. Thanks!
Ryotaro's room
Wait so how did you pay for the meal lol
Riotoro's wife should be happy with such a strong slurp 10/10
Mr British vs Mr Affable
you really should bring Ryotaro on your videos more often. i miss having him around, i joined when way back when your videos were mostly with him (5/6 years ago) . This video reminds me why i followed you and still tune in after so many years. BRING BACK THOSE VIDEOS YOU PIECE OF SHIT!
💙👏
This video made me very happy!
Yes, it is possible John Lennon did visit that ice cream shop.  In the mid/late 70’s, he went with Yoko and their son Sean to Japan.  Yoko was born in Tokyo, Japan and came to America permanently when she was in her late teens.  I have seen photos on the net of them in Japan.
I got as far in the video as you eating Bear again .. I will try your channel again in a few years
It's amazing how easily you three make me want to see so much of Japan.  Hoping to see Tokyo this year and then do a Northern Japan trip in a year or so.  Beautiful!
Glad to finally have Ryotaro back so we can experience an authentic British accent instead of the fake one Chris uses for views.
Gotta appreciate how Chris flew all the way back to autmn. Man of dedication.
I'll be in Nagano this May. Excited to explore the area.
Another A -walk- in Japan noice
I just ate "John Lennon's favorite ice cream," also Royal Vanilla, in Matsumoto.
The main resting points on this route are not exactly hidden. They are quite touristy and appear in most travel guides.
The most impressive part of this video is how well colour matched the bear walking behind Chris and Ryotoro is.  Bravo editor, bravo 👏
Being there breathing the air and taking in the view would cure my sadness immediately
the walking bear killed me! Love the creative route and the regular scheduled videos! Worth the Patreon Backup!
One thing that sets apart your videos from the rest is the drone shots. Absolutely love them as they congeal the story/tale you are spinning.  Where do I sign up for the AbroadInJapan drone school? Here's to a fabulously healthy and productive 2023!
I dream of visiting those towns, it's so beautiful.
We were going to do the trail from Magome to Tsumago on holiday that was cancelled due to Covid.  This video has confirmed we really missed out, gutted! 😭
the bear walking by was the best!
New t-shirt idea - Mr Slurpy!
Love the little history lessons in between the beautiful scenery!
Beautiful videography and content !
“She loves my slurp” - Ryotaro, 2023
How was the ryokan at the end called? Looks nice
Sharlas such a 3rd wheel. Connor and ryatora are boyfriends
This video was beautiful. The architecture and the nature are spot on. Really cool to get insight from multiple perspectives as well.
It’s possible that John Lennon really did like that ice cream.. he was a frequent visitor (and I think resident at one point??) of Karuizawa, Nagano! And THEY have pictures of him 😆
13:23 classic chris
It is always nice to see sneaking bears and ninjas behind Chris and Ryotaro 🙂
This editing is CRAZY
Niceeeeeee
So THAT'S what happened to Bear from The Big Blue House... a sad and delicious end
I've been watchin your content for a long time and because it has been through cast to tv. I've missed subscribeing.  I pressed the button and you deserve it! Have a nice weekend!
20:14 What are the charges?! Enjoying a meal? A SUCCULENT Japanese meal?! 😂
love how it advertises for john lennon when a majority of americans know he was an ass
🙏🙂
….and the ninja too!! Nicely DONE 😂😂😂😂😂😂.
loving these walking videos! Inspires me to explore my own city, San Francisco.
I love when you guys visit lesser traveled places like this!
HE DONT MISS
pls tell Ryotaro that his slurp is overrated
bear jerky is my fav jerky, probably my fav meat
Love to see A fraud in a pan, Risottoro and Charmander hanging out together.
was there in Oktober 2022! so nice. have you been to the waterfalls on the the trail between Magome and Tsumago?
Nicely done with a bear walking by in the background 😂😂😂 👏👏….
Sooo, someone's discovered the slow mo button on the camera? Is it worn out already?
3:32
This is a great example why those of us who have been here a while and don’t live in Tokyo say get out of Tokyo see more of Japan if you’re coming here.   I went back up to Tokyo in June last year (to see cursed child) and it just felt like another world compared to where I’ve lived in Japan.
cor blimey mate a sodding bear just walked past in the background
I think for a traveler who hasnt been to japan or the area ryotaro's room would be really cool for the 'authentic' feel but chris and sharla's room is definitely better for local travel when you've seen japan enough for a hotel to just be a hotel again
Loved the bear and ninja 😂
Oh my god the CG bear walking past the frame in my peripheral vision TERRIFIED me 😫
Wait, you've buried the lead, here - how did you escape Magome without any cash?
I'm going to reply to EVERYTHING with a SLURP from now on💁‍♂️...     For the rest of time🥸
You would think that Chris would not like soba noodles anymore, because of that challenge that he had with that one friend 🤣
Loved this video. It definitely makes me want to visit these locations! So beautiful! Also, nice to see a romantic trip with you and Ryotaro... and I guess a bit of Sharla too!
Abroad in Tub
What an enchanting place! I wish I could escape to this mountain village myself this weekend🌄
I like these travel Style videos. Japanese countryside is just so calming!
×ZARU SOBA   〇MORI SOBA
Kudos to the bear and the ninja for being good sports in the background :)
Chris takes a lovely romantic trip with Ryotoro.  Oh, and I guess Sharla came along too.
I just want to say i absolutely love everytime that you bring out a new video, especially as they get more frequent as i see! These will help me alot in my travels to japan this year
If I ever am lucky enough to be able to build my own house, I need to get hold of that hotel's interior designer. Well, the one that is responsible for Chris' room.
I was like "Oh what a romantic trip for Chris and Sharla!....why is Ryotaro there???" lol such a beautiful area.
How does Chris always show use things we've never seen before?!? For someone who's been all over Japan and shown us so much, it's surprising he can still find awesome places like Nakasendo! Can't wait for all the videos this year 🤩
Narai Juku is one place I absolutely want to visit next time I'm in Japan.
kumamondon
"She LOVES my S@)*#"...
Do Chris and Ryatoro always intentionally sit to eat so their eating hands get in each others way? :)
Hmm Chris seems to be alot nicer to ryotaro this episode.. makes you wonder if Ryotaro paid for it all 😉
1:34 I legit thought he's about to say Eid Mubarak lmao
Another mr.affable classic
The architecture is just so beautiful and timeless. Fills the eyes and the soul.
"who slurp tea like that"  Moroccans does it every time
Chris is my new inspiration, hes doing what i do on my fitness journey, once you reach a certain point you want to walk everywhere and drag your friend with you.
Nice to see Chris with his girlfriend. Oh and Sharla came too.
Great video Chris :)
Traveling an old travel route start to finish would be a great video. Where I used to live in Gifu has part of the Nakasando and there was a local matsuri to I guess celebrating it.
Very Good color grading Chris! I really enjoyed this one
Those steamed buns looked great
great video my guy. Back to the basics of what makes this channel a classic.
I love the editing, though I question my sanity as I watch a bear casually walk past behind you.
Back in Japan mere minutes and already you've travelled the Nakasendo Trail. Impressed. :)
the wax on wax off ... f-bomb off had me in stitches
6:31 wow you can only get those from either Dungeon chests or Making a skeleton kill a charged creeper
Dude this is the content that got me interested in the first place. Love it man.
I can see Chris being influenced by Connor in this video
Bet you weren’t aware when that ninja sneaked quietly behind you guys as you toasted😉. 👍🏼👍🏼😄
this is the kind of video i like the most
Mr. Slurpie lol
My wife and I hiked a portion of the Nakasendo way in Jan of 2019, it was absolutely beautiful... and cold. Staying in Narai was so different to all the other cities we visited in comparison and we loved it. Great video which brought back great memories.
damn having to cutt out multpe people for every joke of somoene wlking behind htem must've been horrible to do. looks fucking great though!
いただきます!
Love the ninja 🤣😭😭😂
Dude, this is breathtaking.
kumamon meat 💀
3:52 - John Lennon's favorite ice-cream
I loved it!
Looking great Chris! Keep up the good work!!
I love the urban planning advocacy that comes out in your videos - once you are in a place where you don’t have to rely on cars, you realize how sickening it is to have places designed for them and nothing else!
Thanks, great video and great to see all 3 of you together
The kind of content I come back for, seeing parts of Japan that you'll not normally see and always appreciate a little bit of history sprinkled on top of all the food and alcohol 🤣
Is it me or you look younger Chris 😅
wouldn't it be cold in the winter if there is only sliding doors?
5:06 Come on Chris, open up your throat and relax your jaw😹😹😹
A lovely video of history, thank you for this and the humour!
Seems like a very nice place to retire to but wish they would leave the bears alone ffs..
Chris, do you do any filming in HDR?
I think we have the new alternate name to the channel, Mr. British.
Glad to see the old chris is back, cheers mate
Entertaining and informative. These villages are so JAPAN! I enjoy your travel videos the most. Will never see Japan in person but this gives me a taste of the country. And btw: I am glad that you are tasting the local cuisine and not me according to an old German saying: what the peasant is not familiar with he won't eat.
Always enjoy a chance to explore Japan through you Chris, thanks.  Does anyone know the name and location on the last place they stayed for the night?
Please tell me that was Sharla in a Bear Suit and then again dressed as a Ninja rather than some digital CGI trick. Please.
Mr. British and Mr. Slurp 😂
Mannnn what is going on today?!?! I’ve been waiting on some more content ; but 2 uploads?!?
its interesting to see how much healthier he looks in comparison to some of his older videos, looks almost like a completely different person altogether
Outstanding content as usual! Congrats guys!
12:47 heheheheh
When Sharla was like “I have no comment” I died 😂😂😂
Love the background edits with the ninja and bear! Beautiful locations… would love to see more!
My dream is to go with you three to visit these villages and hot springs. Thanks for uploading on a cold winters day. Made me so happy ❤❤
Ever since that video that mentioned that you shouldnt sit on the left of a left handed guy, I always take notice on how literally everyone sits on Chris' left
beatiful
Thanks!
Nice to see the content start to pump out again.
Don’t stop. We like rain and baths!
Risottaro….Pfffttt nahhh Mr. Slurp 👍 heck yeah!
I’d love to live in a place like this gahh
lol human DONG 🤣🤣
When was this filmed? Like early fall?
Don’t usually comment but bloody heck that bear was amazing tracked and lit, took me a couple of seconds to work out if it was placed in or real. Nice work Chris
whats the temperature there? that your walking only with a t-shirt... or is it pre-filmed?
Love the travel videos! Also cool bonus Japanese history in this one
Always great to see Ryotaro!   If you guys forgot cash and there aren't ATMs, does that mean you dine and dashed!?
The b-roll is extra crispy and cinematic this time around 👌
I always love how much effort you put into the production of your videos. The make a place in the sun look tacky 😂
RIP PADDINGTON
I did this back in November! SOO MANY ICE CREAM SHOPS
Thank you for your video! I love this trio and I honestly come to your vidoes to relax and unwind, its so nice to watch. Thank you!
Yaaaay! Travel videos!!! I love these!
Bear
I don't know how far behind this is from your boxing chess match, but Chris you still look great, hope you still feel great.
So how did you pay that restaurant with no money?
Nice.
I am planning on moving to Japan in a month and the Nakasendo is the first thing I'll do once I get settled in. Thanks to Norm's video and yours  I now have some more inspiration 🤗
Just to make sure - Autumn is mid November!
Thank you for doing your travel videos. When I was younger I had a huge fascination with Japan (kind of a weeb) but as I got older I essentially fell out of it. After watching your videos, I'm reminded of why I loved Japan so much in the first place. Your videos of Hokkaido are my favorite and I really hope to visit there in the near future. Thank you so much Chris!
Really enjoy when you talk about the history of an area.
7:32 is the most english/american ryotaro has ever sounded
So happy to see the return of the travel vids!  Fun that Sharla will be in a lot of them (I'm assuming)  And Ryotaro 😄as well!  The travel videos are what our family got into when we first discovered the channel!
Lmao that bear passing through
Glad to see this guests on channel! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Your chemistry with ryotaro.. inject it directly in my veins 😩😩😫
"Thankfully in two seperate rooms" wow. I never considered you were brave enough to share a room with Ryotaro!
So much meat. That was the worst part of the 'restoration', Western meat eating. Japan should reclaim its meat-free heritage.
Ah a travelers town
wonderful, thank you mister broad
Two videos in two weeks? We're eating!
I walked the trail from Magome to Tsumago a few years ago with my dad. It's great to see it get more coverage because it's so damn beautiful.  There's a look out just up the hill at the end of Magome. I must have sat there for hours just sitting and staring at the stunning view
The smile on his face when he introduces Sharla. Awesome... and yeah, there is his sidekick, too ;)
Ryotaro is such a sweetheart. Sharla seems nice too
Great video. Good to see Ryoutaro again.
Loved the CGI Bear and Ninja!
The video is great! I've been watching all of you to prepare for my trip. Thanks!
I just booked my trip to Japan for October and I am planning to walk the Nakasendo trail between Tsumago and Magome. Thanks for sharing Chris, I'm very excited to see the Nakasendo trail!
So, given the nice weather, is autumn the high season for this area?
She loves my slurp - Ryotaro 2023 ...f*ck me dead...XD
i feel like the super high production value of chris' videos and especially the b-roll and the colorwork goes kind of underappreciated. im glad you put so much good work into your videos
"All right Mr British" was the icing on the cake.
I love these Travel Japan vids! I get to walk vicariously through your point of view while I save the money needed to go back to Japan sometime soon!
Chrizz Broad
Poor Paddington bear 😂
Have you ever done a video on Himeji Castle? I would love to see the inside of that someday, if they allow filming in it.
Great to see some bears being eaten up, the smug tossers.
Dammit, take my likes like a vending machine! Goddammit, Chris and Scharla, Take. MY. SAD. CANADIAN. LIKES. 🤣
This feels like so soon after your walk across Tokyo video- I'm not complaining. What a treat- what beautiful surroundings spiced up with your usual sarcasm and entertaining antics. Your videos just keep getting better. I feel like If I ever get to Japan I will know what to look for. Thank you as always.
Added to my list of places to visit. Thanks for sharing.
From a Twitter account I found online who recounted John's trips to Japan he states, "John and Yoko would escape the summer heat and humidity by heading to Karuizawa, a resort northeast of the metropolis, and stay at the Mampei Hotel. The former Beatle was a frequent customer at Cafe de Minoriya and a fan of their vanilla soft-serve ice cream." So I guess this rumour has some credibility.
1:18 nice choice in music in that car. ;-)
Yay another old scholarship video!
a new video already nice!
i hope you paid Sharla for the camera work
Amazing content man💮💮💮 beyond beautiful is an understatement.
Actually the Beatles did tour japan... The ice cream thing may be an over-exaggeration, but there's a chance he did actually eat it.
Wise words 13:52
As someone that is allergic to the mushrooms we eat typically in America, would I be allergic to the mushrooms eaten in japan? plz say no cuz that seems to be in every food there
Sharla? sydsnap? Getting the Japanese blondes mixed up I guess there is a reason why everyone hates trash taste 🚮🤪👨‍👩‍👧‍👧👨‍👨‍👧‍👦👩‍👩‍👦‍👦👨‍👦‍👦👩‍👧‍👧
you get a downvote for eating bear.
The voice over microphone is a bit quiet compared to the camera mic
Oh wow, this is the first I've heard of eating bear! Fascinating. All of the villages are beautiful.
I'm surprised you feel bad about eating bear 😄 bears are ruthless, violent, generally awful creatures. Unlike many predators that kill their prey first, bears don't bother killing their prey and rip them apart while they're still alive. It's quite horrendous.  Meanwhile cows are generally very peaceful, friendly even, and they're adorable. They spend their days lounging about and will actually befriend humans and act like dogs if raised that way.  Don't get me wrong I still eat beef, but I definitely feel worse about eating beef than I would about eating bear.
Having a car drive through their tourist district is such a Japanese thing to do. It makes all sense though from their perspective. It's wide enough, innit? It's got road signs on there, innit? Then I'm gonna drive through it. Beats having the city pave extra roads that go around the tourist spots.   Says the guy that just drove right through the ninenzaka district in his family car in December.😅
Paddington Bear stew.................I'm good thanks - but I really do enjoy the travel vids keep em coming please :)
I got scared for you when I saw the bear, luckily he seemed friendly. Great vid!
Hey Chris Amazing video as per usual. I absolutely love when you sneak ASO into your vids never fails to make me laugh.
I love these travel videos and walking videos to see more around Japan and the day to day I love it !!! By far my favorite of your videos
chris, to slurp your noodles, try grabbing less noodles, you can even practice with just one. for a long time i slurped my noodles just like you and just grabbing less noodles at a time spared me of these embarrassing moments when i couldn't slurp my noodles.
Makes me want to go back and go on that trail, can you let us know what the cost of the inn and the house costs?
Ryotaro is just a magical topping every time he joins 😇
Great to see these travel videos again! And it's so fun to see you with your brother Ryotaro and hunny-bun Sharla. Too Cute!😍
Didn’t know Sharla was a Jets fan lol
I was so confused for a second when the bear walked through the shot
Great video chris
ryotaro has the most mancunian accent ever
I MISS YOUR STUDIO. You spend so much making such an amazing studio and then never use it.
I like the psych experiment during the intro of bear segment.
Ryotaro can't drink alcohol? IS RYOTARO PREGNANT?
looks like a good place to escape for a break
the bear scared the shite out of me. Love the video, another location to my list of places to visit :)
Love is alive and well in Japan. It's always great to see a relationship continue to blossom over time. Too bad they needed Sharla there to film it.
Looks amazing, looks like *Japan* ! That´s what it´s supposed to look like. Wow.
Nobody in the comments is going to mention Ryotaro's "she loves my slurp?"
Ryotaro's room looks sick.
Loved the video. So beautiful!
Chris is quite the dashing young man
Dump that woman and get back with Natsuki
I can't wait for the video series of Chris walking/jogging across the entirety of Japan! :D
love it !!! keep up chris
All these years, Chris and Ryotaro still sit next to each where their dominant hands get in the way. Well, I guess they learned to sit the other way at least once!
I don't think Sharla would appreciate you going around "smelling some wood" mate 👀
I'm off to Japan in about a month on a year-long visa and the Nakasendo Trail is at the top of my list to do while I'm there, will have to make a stop at Magome for sure!
Really enjoyed this video, just wonderful all around
Absolutely stunningly shot video Chris 😍! I swear the quality of  these videos keeps getting better and better! I really appreciate being able to come on these journeys with you, it feels like I'm living vicariously through your experiences!  One day I'll get to Japan and live these experiences too, until then keep up with the amazing work! Looking forward to more of these videos 😁 xx
LOL Was not ready for 13:53
That was Ryotaro's best intro yet, speaking a new language just for this video! I love these videos set in the countryside focusing on the "old" Japan and the way people used to live. So pretty and tranquil!
I love that your videos have this crisp but cozy quality to them that always immerses me into the places that you visit.
did you get a new mic? your intor sounds i bit more raw and growly than before, like I can hear that your have minimum facial hair
i could never in good conscience eat the bear meat now that Chris has put thoughts of pooh bear in my head but the destruction of my childhood aside great video i enjoy living vicariously through your experiences with these videos
Well dang Ryotaro you made me squeal with laughter - so naughty!
Ive missed these kind of videos with Risottoro
I love Chris and Sharla becoming mainstays on each others videos - I bet my mum chriss xmas present would be a ring that made her happier than Gollum in mount Doom - theres still time
ANOTHER ONE. ALREADY!!!! I’ve died and gone to heaven
I miss these types of video and I would be lying if I said I didn't miss Ryotaro in your videos. Hope this video does well so we get to see more of it 😊
I love these videos where you take us on a journey to explore all the Beautiful places in japan!
The random bear startled me lol but I prefer Chris room. Those stairs look treacherous.
Predictions for 2023: Chris will walk the Nakasendo as a fitness challenge / Journey Across Japan. Maybe Nakasendo one way, Tokaido on the way back. Slurptaro will start an ASMR channel.
Time to retire the skinny jeans Ryotaro
you missed a great opportunity to put affable and laughable over the top of your heads
thank you for todays video
Sorry, Ryotaro got the better room. The modern look is nice but I'm staying in a Ryokan, I'd want everything to be as traditional as possible, even if it's less convenient. 😅
Me and my friends will be in Japan in September. You give us great information and inspiration for our trip. Thanks 😊
Risottoro
Brilliant video, the scenery is amazing.
that bear cg caught me so off guard i laughed out loud. great stuff. always nice to have ryotoro around as well, we miss him.
I like gaming much more than just vlogs but u somehow make it my favorite thing
You guys need to switch sides when you eat! I love how your travel vlogs are almost like a documentary. I guess that most people like the snarky, sarcastic Chris as n journey across Japan, but I have always enjoyed your more serious information videos. 👍
I mean, bears are very ecologically important while domestic cows are not, although domestic cows suffer a lot more than bears, so it's debatable which is less ethical to eat.
Ryotoros british accent is pretty good lmao
The place looks very scenic
Why would I escape a place like this, my god I'd love this.
You look really fit Chris 💪
"she loves my slurp" 🤣🤣🤣
Love to see Chris’ villain arc kicking off as a dine and dasher this video
Love your videos. Miss Japan. Thanks for enteraining me, Chris Fit.
someone learned to use cgi, just sad I saw 0 fighter jets ^^
I'd like to compliment Chris's presenter voice. Very professional.
Everything looks so expensive.
Love these kind of videos! But I got the feeling this one was more about the food than anything else haha
The "outside bath" is a vat where you usually mix cement...
Is Ryotaro third wheeling or Sharla? haha. Love the vid Chris
I adore videos like this, though they do make me sad that I can't spend months of every year exploring Japan!
Abroad in Japan has just fully adopted the early 2000s discovery channel, traveling guy with an accent
That bear scene killed me!!! 🐻🤣
I was just there (all 3 towns) in November.  🍁
I was just about to ask when this was filmed as I thought it'd be a bit too cold now, but then you just said it was Autumn
Two abroad in Japan videos in one week! It's not like I am complaining or something.
i thought that bear and ninja was real for a second lol
You didn't even try the ice cream?
Ryotaro has a wife???!
Your content is so beautiful and fascinating. Really captivating to watch. Educational and fun 🎌
Just recently subscribed, ONE day I will get to Japan, but for now am LOVING seeing your adventures! Keep up the awesome work!
12:45 Trash Taste’s Influence on Chris
“She loves my slurp” legend
Peasant.
comment for algorithm
2 videos in a week, we're eating well ! Thank you Chris for the amazing content
weird hearing proscuitto referred to as parma ham
meat and mushrooms...2 things I don't eat lol. looks like I'm going to starve to death😅💀 we're visiting this November and I'm excited!
As a backpacker this is the fastest a trail has gone from 'never heard of it' to 'how much are plane tickets'
I've seen worse compositing in mainstream Hollywood productions a million times over than that bear at 11:10 . Holy crap that was clean.
health question for Ryotaro next time you gents eat bear. I hear that, just as with wild boar, bears contract trichynosis. Tiny worms(nematodes) that make you sick when they get inside you alive. Does bear meat get tested before it's served as shabu shabu?
The editing in this is great, I'm really enjoying the added little FXs popping up here and there! What a beautiful set of little towns, I'd love to visit them.
I comment for the algorithm and for my love of this content
Affable?/Fappable?
Nice video. Lousy description details this time around. What gives I wonder....
Lord please make it possible that me and our family can travel to Japan 🙏🏽💕 it’s so pretty
That bear scared the shit outta me 😅
Chris, your video production quality is so good. It's been really great watching your creative evolution over the years. This is easily the production quality I would expect to see on a Travel Channel or Food Network. Fantastic.
Love this location a lot! Thank you for showing us - I had no clue it existed.
That bear meat looked like rows of Y fronts!
Really brave of Chris to leave his girlfriend around an alpha male like Ryotaro.
Such a beautiful area. I'll do the Magome-Tsumago trail(actually Magome-Nagiso) but continue with Matsumoto and Shibuonsen on a five night sidetrip from Tokyo in May. The part of my longer travel I'm looking forward the most. 😻
Will we be getting a "Taken for Garnted" series in 2023?
Absolutely loved it! Let’s have more of this kind of adventures Lovely to have Ryotoro again! Sorry Ryotoro I preferred Chris & Sharla’s room! In fact I love this room I was wondering how can I book it for my upcoming Japanese trip! This trail is amazing I really want to check it out! Thank you 🙏🏼 for a fun traditional Japanese holiday break ! The only thing I would leave out is bear meat 😩Take care Sabrina🇫🇷🇬🇧
Not so hidden anymore :/
This video was just so relaxing
Man, thank you. I was having a horrible day, finding nothing i could relax to, and then you come with a Mountain Village video which i love. Thanks for this moment.
Awesome video. Stunning architecture and beautiful nature. One day I go to Japan
I just realized how much I missed these types of narrated videos of you. I like the others to but these types of videos have a special charm.
For everyone not asking, it's a 1ZPresso JX Pro manual coffee grinder.
I'd love to see some of the gardens in Japan. I kinda bought a Japanese maple, which led to another, which led to another. Next thing I knew I had 30 cultivars purchased or on order.  Good thing most can grow in pots.
asdfasjfh my grandma had one of those record players built into a counter like that! I remember everyone saying it was worth a lot of money, decades ago....
10 pounds of makeup
Great video Chris, I'm glad that you can once again post these classic travel and tourism videos.
Amazing work on this video, I really appreciated the vignettes and arts. Take my like!
As always very nicely done. Thanks for the inspiration for my first trip to japan - Nakasendo looks awesome. But I am guessing i have to learn as good japanese as rissotaros english is now
The bear walking behind genuinely scared the shit out of me 😂
Oh I would totally love to go through the whole walk. The views must be stunning.
Nice to see the three of you having a fun trip for us to tag along, don’t need anything else.
Did you have to wash the pots?
Really liked the cultural background and the way you presented it. ご苦労様です
I stayed in the guesthouse right next to the water-wheel you choose to speak from 😂 I absolutely LOVED Magome! It is breathtaking and at night, they lit lanterns all the way from bottom to top of the village, beautiful! Also, better at night as there was less tourists. Highly recommend visiting!
Mmm...accidently clicked when i opened it to halfway through and first thing i heard was "it's just me and Ryotaro smelling wood ..that's all it is" hehe the images 🤔😹
holy shit another video I'm so happy, your videos singlehandedly motivate me to open my genki textbook 💀
Ryotoro and Chris smelling wood? Tat sounds way too wrong 🤣🤣
Ryotaro is so funny, I'M TEAM FAFFABLE
I like how they talk about bear meat you see an animated bear walk right behind them. Good job by the editor putting that in.
Not the fucking Bear in a Big Blue House walking behind them in the background 🤣🤣🤣
glad to see Ryotaro back on the channel because whenever he's in the videos, there are lots of food 😆😆
We definitely need Bath time with Broad as a real podcast
2 videos in the he same week?! No way
F A F F A B L E
2:05 Ryotaro serving some glam
It would of been more credible if they had a picture of John Lennon with the ice cream 😂😅
Are we really not going to talk about the bear that just casually walk by two British men eating bear meat
I enjoyed the last one hope you keep this going I really enjoy it ❤
nice to Ryotaro again!
Arigato gozaimasu, (virtual) mate! 🙇‍♂So glad you're ramping up the video drops this year; congrats to, and for, everything last year.  Always a pleasure to see The Ancient One—Ryotaro-dono @RyotarosJapan... Always an honor and the *utmost* pleasure to see The Beautiful One, too—Sharla-sama @sharlainjapan!!  ⛩Keep on keeping on, Chris-sama!!⛩
these videos make me happy. Thank you so much!
Is this something one can do without speaking Japanese? Looks amazing!
it's 3am here on my timezone, when i saw that bear walking behind i got surprised lmao
Man these locations were absolutely gorgeous! Thanks for the nostalgic peek at our previous Autumn!
Your videos are top quality, putting countryside to shame XD.
The worst thing about Chris not being Fat anymore is that the constant Rio-Chris trying new foods are now a rare thing 😥
Loved the bear walking behind you at dinner. ILM
That hotel room was designed by Haruki Murakami
Manapua is the balls!
Love these!
i have checked out some videos from Gifu i was hopin you would cover at some point.. thx ^^
I prefer the faffable room. Has that old timey feel.
Natsuki saying, "Go F yourself," is my ringtone now :3
So you know it's got to be horse meat.
"what about bear dong"
Mr.Slurpy "She Loves My SLURP"!😝
i love how sharla is the sane mature one to supervise the two children xD love it.
Sad that these travel videos don't do too well anymore, these are some of my favourite content on Youtube.  Chris somehow makes Japan look even more beautiful than usual in these shots and it's so interesting to find out about these places. Top notch as per usual Chris!
I did not expect to see a walking bear in the video!!! haha hilarious!
not hidden then are they :)
Love your videos my only complaint is its too short I want hours
Loved the video Chris! Absolutely amazing area. I would like Ryotoros room more I think, the building was so cool. Kinda sad this video was shorter because the towns were really nice I wanted to see more! I think you should drag ryotoro along to walk the whole trail sometime but anyway thanks for the awesome work as always!
15:57 LOL
This bear walking behind you scared me as hell
New segment, Aboard in a bath. At least you are getting your time in, without Connor beating you there.
I know Ryotaro is a married man but that slow motion bit of him wlking shot from behind, very respectfully, daaaaaaaaamn!
I love bear. Tastes almost exactly like venison, but it's a bit sweeter. My favorite way to cook bear/venison is with a heavy amount of oil+butter, chopped onions, finely diced garlic, and S+P, left to simmer for at least 30 minutes. I make it every chance I'm gifted the meat
That bear and that ninja caught me off guard lol
The walk from Magome to Tsumago is one of the worlds most popular (and breathtaking) hikes, lots of fantastic waterfalls and views. You really missed out here Chris
I'm finally moving to Japan this March after years of watching your videos. Thank you for everything Chris!
"Wax on, wax off, fuck off" 😂 Didn't expect to hear that here
I did expect Cdawg to just appear in the hot spring
Your videos really hit the spot with maintaining high production value but not feeling overproduced, feels a lot like older youtube.
The innuendos in this video are on another level 😉
Absolutely amazing scenery on the trail, definitely on the list of places I need to visit in Japan! Thanks for sharing. Brilliant video as always, Chris.
I'll never recover from Mr Slurpy.
This is engagement!  Surely it will drive traffic to this video, because I will have fooled the Almighty Algorithm.  I may have screwed it up by putting the word 'algorithm' in the comment.  Dangit, now it's twice.  I'll try to cancel it out by putting my favorite time stamp in the comment at 5:45 .  Get 'em, Sharla!  15:06  I couldn't find any info on green poisonous/venomous spiders in Japan.  The Redback is a version of a Black Widow.  Is there an invasive species?
I spend 3 days in Tsumago at a 800 year old ryokan and it was fantastic, he wasnt lying about the enormous amount of spiders lol
12:21 Chris is going the Food Wars route!!!!
THE BEAR
I bet John Lennon will enjoy that ice cream in heaven.
2 videos in a week?! Chris gone mad.
I can't stand the sound of people chewing and slurping and I'm wondering if slurping is truly a cultural thing in Japan? Like a thing of respect?  I'd love to visit Japan but I'd probably need to wear ear buds at restaurants...
That bear walking behind you came out of nowhere. My mind was tricked into a WTF moment for a second.
If you guys didn't have cash, how did you pay for the meals? 😅
"who slurps tea like that!?" Japanese people hosting traditional tea ceremonies: Huh?
thumbs down for promoting of hunting and eating bear.
I think these videos are less popular because they look like a pure advert of 20 minutes long. I would prefer more friendly chats and to see more of Sharla and walks, rather than food.
Joking about Vivaldi aside, I really enjoyed this video and I really enjoyed Paul's editing too. It was different but entertaining.
I just finished watching the video and liked it a lot! I have to say I prefer Ryotaro's "safe" house compared to Chris', the safe house felt more adventurous. I also have a small suggestion: You could add the Japanese writing for the places' names as well like you did with all the different meals and the fireplace, as someone studying Japanese I think it'd be nice to see what kanji these different places use in their names.
One hour in, 54,000 views.   Travel videos don’t do well anymore?  Your videos are amazing.
norm did it first 🥱
Hi there~ usually I don't comment, but I just wanted to say that every city in this video is... Simply gorgeous, I don't know! I really dream to visit Japan in person one day. Keep it up with the good job, Chris, your travel vlogs are always so fun and cozy to watch👌🏻 (Yes... Even with Ryotaro... You two are so funny together 😂)
That looks like a must visit place on a trip to Japan, do love your travel video content.
New video already?! I love you chris
Thank you so much for your content Chris! It’s really amazing! Not only your videos but your entire journey of self improvement has been really inspiring!
As long as you’ve been in Japan you seem awfully triggered by slurping….. that and going into the inaka without cash….  I suppose the whole fish out of water gaijin thing is part of the act
Chill mode nature videos are always the best.
Ryotaro: "She loves my slurp" 🤣
While I would love a tour of Ryotaro's rooms, I wouldn't want to sleep there. Chris' room for the win.
The last place you stayed at was beautiful!
looking good chris
How could you do this to me Chris?!? I just finished eating and now I'm hungry again :(
you ruined the video with the filter,
2023 gonna be amazing
WOOOOOOO!
Love the historical context mate. Big up Tokugawa dem
undoing your gains with travel food
I can't believe the prophecy from the Tsukiji fish market video came true and Chris and Ryotaro finally smelled the wood! 9:03
She loves his slurp.
Are the spiders Poisonous or Venomous? Ones way for dangerous
Mr Brittsh! lol
Is this shot last year?
Venomous not Poisonous :D
But... Mr Abroad, you never said if John Lennons favorit ice cream was any good 😢.
Chris really just rotoscoped something walking behind him and Ryatoro... not once, but twice. That's dedication. I don’t even want to know how much time he spent on that visual gag.
Nice for Sharla also to appear.  Ryotaro is behaving good for a third wheel. 🙂
Mr British and Mr Slurpy on their great Adventuers.
🎶 JAPAN WE KILL THINGS  THAT WE LIKE🎶  FAMILY GUY
"6 to 12 months of the year" - 12 months is a year though
Bathtime with abroad would unironically make an entertaining broadcast, just chris drinking in a bath chatting about life
Dr. Jelly and Mr. British colab, please?
Why do you never show japanese girls in your videos
I love the second room! It has a more natural feeling to it and the exposed materials are personally more comfortable
Nice bear
That bear in Backround food part i was wtf
pretty
Chris u need a group and hike that trail
it's just me or ryotaro's english pronunciation has improved a lot?
Awesome job chris
Good stuff Chris 2 videos one month WP also love to see you walking and doing exercise to get to your goal gl!
Very nice, I'm really enjoying these walking videos a lot. One thing I noticed is the transition between staying in a traditional inn and tasting the bear meat is strangely instant, was is intended?
Oh hi Cris you didn't get my comment about the VMP will it's work on Amazon prime and Tubi
I don't mean to alarm you, but there seem to be 2001 CGI animations roaming the place.
Why does Japan looks so much like anime I watch 😅
Always enjoy your content, Chris – but as a huge fan of both walking and Japan, this sounds absolutely perfect. Hope you guys had a good time down here in Dorset over Christmas!
Those 60 fps B-roll shits are just amazing!
Nice to see some of these off the beaten path kind of places!
Anybody else see the bear at 11:04? 😂
A perfect video to wake up and relax with before a shift
I just got back from doing the Nakasendo! stayed in Nagiso after trekking from Magome through Tsumago. So cool to see you make the trip too!
she loves my slurp
Wtf was that bear in the background??
I was just in Narai-juku in early December. Sadly it was just a day trip from Matsumoto, but I wish I had stayed at a place like BYAKU!
It looks so lovely.. those baths. Even better if there was snow around. I would be worst tourist.. I would just find first inn with solo bath.. and just soak for the rest of my vacation.
Oi, Chris, we the British can't listen to Vivaldi because of the DWP,  I wanted to throw a andline phone across a room upon hearing it and I haven't had a landline in 10 years
A broad in Japan:  0:55  Abroad in Japan:  14:24   🌈 _The More You Know_ ⭐️
Kagamoto
What’s the difference between doburi and gyudon
The Mr. Miyagi bit got me, as well as the wandering bear lol
when was this recorded? Is it warm in Japan right now?
While I love the convenience of cities, it's places like this that I feel are the best to live in for peace of mind and soul.  Also, better chances of surviving if ever there was a zombie outbreak. Imagine being in Tokyo during one of those. Guaranteed insta-kill.
A picture of Kumamon was in my high school American Government textbook. I was the only person in the class who knew who he was, if you would believe it.
The background looks so bad when you faked the restaurant just for one bear lol
Abroad in a bodybag, lol.
Goddammit Chris. Yet another place I need to go to before I finally unsubscribe from living.
Nice to see Chris finally escaping Connor
Whenever you open bath i expect Connor inside :D The conditioning is real
2 posts within a week!? It's like a magic
For some reason I got a bit of a jump scare from that bear walking across the background 😂
11:03 LOL that's insane, how long did that take to edit??
Parma ham? Jamón serrano más bien XD
she does  love the slurp sexy time yes🤣
In this video Chris smells Ryotaro's wood and we learn that Ryotaro's (mr Slurpee) wife loves his slurp and then they get 69:ed in Magome
Chris has turned into a true Japanese movie person, audio desync and all!
Nice job sneaking in that too much volcano while also using the pan effect to create the illusion of sound travelling. :D Beautiful location!
Hi, Chris and company! I’ve been wanting you to make this video for a long time. I throughly enjoyed it. Love the historic and scenic towns and trail. So beautiful. A real taste of old Japan. I hope you will do more of these videos. I enjoy the travel videos very much. They give me several ideas of places to go to when I finally make a trip to Japan. Very helpful and inspirational to me.😊 Love Ryotaro for these classic Japan travel videos. He finds the coolest places to visit, stay and eat.😊
I love these, thank you!!
Cash is king.
I just wanted to say thanks for posting videos Chris, you really do allow me to live in Japan vicariously through your camera lens and that's something i really cherish a lot so keep doing what you're doing.. ☺🤗
I see they continue to sit in the opposite sides still, after many years of friendship
There is definitely a disturbance in the force. Light travelled slower than this ABJ upload.🤯
What's the name of the second hotel?
ooooh this is beautiful! both the towns and the accommodation! I must get myself to Japan in autumn sometime so I can stay in a traditional building without suffering from the heat and humidity I usually get in August  😅
Chris, these videos are amazing. Journey across Japan 2.0! I've watched every video and will continue to watch! Thank you so much for your S+ tier content
What a coincidence! I'm currently doing the Nakasendo Trail on the Conqueror Challenges and I'm 10% done. I'm past the Pâtisserie Sadaharu Aoki. Cool!
Chris: "making fun of Ryotaro slurping." Ryotaro: "but have you heard about the mushrooms"
Great video.   Please keep it clean, and don’t curse/bleep yourself in post.
I know her 😇😏
Really interesting vidoe. Something i would love to do when I visit Japan
We need a Mr British series.
This is certainly my favourite style of vid. Great to see the different parts of Japan.
Those slurps convinced me to like and subcribe.
The B roll for this video is jaw dropping
Love the editing in the background of 2:49!
Is there are reason you stayed only two nights ? I mean, at least for me you don't need to rush such projects i appreciate all the work and if you would have done a 5 day trip and filmed it I would have also watched a mini series with one video for each day. 😆
The shrines @ 21:19 🤯🤯🤯
Sharla: "this is my boyfriend Chris, and this is Chris's boyfriend Ryotaro"
I'm just getting into hiking, and I hope to try the Nakasendo trail. Yaya Ryotoro and Sharla too! Is there a trail to hike Japan tip to tail like the Apailachian Trail on the east coast of the states?
The bear in the background lmfao 😂
Looks beautiful, amazing history and John Lennons favourite ice-cream 🤣
YOOO! LOVE THIS. Keep doing this please!
Heres a question for sharla,  does chris ever think about anything besides his next meal?
Thanks for the regular content Chris, great videos as always!
I'm digging this style a lot sir. As someone who is visiting in October, this is right up my ally.
I love this videos so  much
I love these types of videos! Its a good way to learn more about the beautiful more less common parts of Japan , The food , the scenery and the ambiance that these villages produce is mindboggling! Keep up the great work!
Narai Juku is amazing in the rain, but a must-visit during a decent snow fall for .... Is that a BEAR!?  Never tried it before, but pretty interested now!  I gotta visit again soon!
Ryottoros english is improving a lot!
you look like you have lost weight.
absolutely gorgeous place. def adding it to my itinerary when im in Japan for 6 months next year. Also the bear brought a grin to my face and you can tell chris and ryotaro are close friends by the way they mess with each other, great video as always guys and awesome work as well from Sharla.
Japan was always for me a place I found interesting but didn't really have an urge to visit. But this video really changed my mind on that
Damn, we're on Chris' walking arc!
Commenting for the algorithm!
You and Sharla have a wonderful chemistry on camera. 🔥🔥
Im really addicted to this channel, I got so happy when i saw a new video was out
good to see sharla 3rd wheeling chris and ryotoro's date
The places you went to look nice with all the nature around but I agree on the last place with the not liking the spiders lol. The places you stayed in are interesting, too. I can't imagine eating bears though.
I love walking videos 😍
Loving all the extras Chris has hired for this video; the ninja and the bear must have enjoyed being able to work with such a famous youtuber!
"She Loves My Slurp". It'd be a crime *not* to turn that into merch!  Really though; I enjoyed this trip down Nakasendo Trail. Gonna have to add that to the future travel plans list. Great to see Ryotaro and Sharla too. Thanks for another video so quickly, Chris.
:o that was a very cool look around. I like these moutnainy places. :3 I would love more on the mountain areas. It looks naturally beautiful. I would appreciate more of this everytime. <3
I love this type of video from AIJ. Clicked super fast!
I have missed these trips with Ryotaro lol
"wax on, wax off, fuck off" hahahahahahaa XD
I just had a meal, but I'm starving after watching this.
I think I’m just gonna have to save a ton of money and take a month long trip to Japan! There’s so much I want to see because of your videos!
omg everything there is so beautiful
Really enjoy the videos. Keep up the great work!
I Love This!! Keep up the amazing work!!! Thank you for the effort you put in Walking all about for us!!! ☺
Ryotaro’s room is the room id have to stay in at least once. It has vibes. Staying again would depend on comfiness.
I am dismayed that Ryotaro stole my pick-up line! (1:34)
11:08 the bear making a guest appearance 💀
New Abroad in Japan vids in short order - good times ahead! BTW, those joro spiders may look wild, but they are completely harmless. They generally don't bite, and even if you somehow manage to get one to bite you, they aren't very venomous at all - all those comparisons to black widows and whatnot are just urban myth BSery.
Oh wow! I was listening to the podcast and there Chris announced that he's going to release a video and suddenly my YT notifs went up! What impeccable timing!
First Winnie the Pooh, then a grizzly just walked by.  Why...?
Record player and fresh beans with a grinder. Can’t ask for a classier atmosphere. Love everything about this video. Keep the content coming bro !
need more Ryotaro been a while since he's been in any vids
The Japanese tourism board should ban the driving of cars in Nakasendo trail.  For preservation purposes.  But, it's up to them.  Enjoying ur vlogs here.  Thanks buddy 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
“She loves my slurp” Ryotaro merch when?
Poor Sharla, feels like she's the third wheel on this romantic trip with Mr. Slurpee.
What's the name of the place you were staying in the second night? I'm seriously considering staying there on a trip next year.
Nothing super insightful to comment here, just doing my bit to appease the algorithmic gods—AiJ is one of my favourite channels and seeing uploads like this brightens my day. Happier to see a new Ryotaro appearance than Chris will seemingly ever be, haha. Thanks for doing what you do!
So beautiful! Thanks for sharing… just a quick question… If a traveler were to visit this particular area, and spoke very little Japanese… would they be able to manage ok?
faffable undoubtedly
Are these spiders poisonous or venomous, Chris?
I would love to take that trip on a motorcycle
りょたろ !!!
13:19 with all this walking talk, this got me thinking, i think its about time for another Journey Across Japan but you only walk to your destinations
Chris doesn't want to be a hot tub streamer..    He wants to be a hot spring streamer.
Isn’t slurping expected? Trying to be quiet seems like more of an English thing. Assuming Ryotaro’s wife is Japanese, she probably would be more surprised at a lack of slurping noodles.
Okay, it is added to my list to visit by train!
She loves my slurp!
bro, you did level up ! damn !
o no.. dont tell me you guys are shabushabu kumamon~~
Two Abroad In Japan videos in a week? Christmas has come early
So glad to see that regular releases are becoming a thing again! Have you considered scheduling these visits to where you can interview the locals like the bear hunter and people who run the traditional inns?
Really like these videos, always informative but still very cinematic. Cant wait until I can go and experience japan myself
You heart Riotaro manly advise Slurp and your wife will love it😎
"Paddington the Bear" lmao
If you eat Paddington is marmalade on top obligatory?
5:39 hahaaaaaa oh my lurrrt
nice
I love these videos!
Now I wonder how you paid for your lunch in Magome if you couldn't pay by credit card and none of you had no cash with... 🤔
great editing....awesome vid
"i never had Vanilla ice cream like this before" isn't necessarily an endorsement ;)
I spotted Sharla in the thumbnail! I’m here for some cute couple shenanigans and likely lots of sarcasm from Chris.
That was some amazingly stunning scenery!
When you started talking about it being autumn a little later in the video, I had been thinking it must have been filmed around then and it wasn't filmed super recently... aside from the fact that you and Sharla have been away from Japan for a bit here giving that away, it was really that I could tell that you've lost noticeable weight in your face since you filmed this video 🙂Keep up the good work there - I know it's hard, but the payoff is definitely noticeable!
Poor man’s Richard Hammond
Cant believe i have watched chris for like 10 years now. Hey chris send me some fried chicken from japan?
Nice to see Chris traveling with his partner.  Nice also to see Sharla joining them.
This is stunning camera work.
Abroad in Japan video is always so relaxing
Lol risotto is 3rd wheel lmao, is it me did Chris sound like David Attenborough while he narrate. Risotto's room looks like a damn mosoleum crypt.
I was kind of wondering like, Sharla is vegan... I think? So do these places have accommodation for vegetarians and vegans or do they just bring their own food?  Yes, we did see that eggplant bun tho
I read that as _Nintendo_ 😅
"She loves my slurp" We need this printed on some merch 🤣🤣🤣
So Walking In Japan is gonna be a series now? Nice, now I can see you upload more.
I did this walk in 2019 after renting a car in Nagoya and driving out to the country. Was one of the best decisions I made on my Japan trip - highly recommend!
I don't ever wanna eat bear meat after hearing the terrifying ways that parasites and worms can kill you from nestling in your brain and spinal cord. Hard pass for me.
She loves my Slurp should be your next song
Why don't you collab with BALD and bankrupt ??????????????????????
That video in particular feels very well shot. The views, the colours, there is something beautiful about it.
Ur looking good chris keep up the healthy lifestyle
This type of content fits really well with the channel. Keep it up
I'm only happy when it rains, i only smile in the dark !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love the B and B motherfucker !!!!!!!!!!!! 69 NOICE !!!!!! I always bring cash, how do you think i pay for the BITCHES ?????????????????
Nothing beats a good old Chris and Ryotoro video.
6:13 GIGA CHAD Christopher Abroad making his girl friend hold the umbrella. One can only hope to be half as affable as this specimen.
I really like this sort of video, so will make a comment in the hopes that more people have it recommend and want to watch it
Chris you look great, you look like a twig now
Another walking video? and with Ryotaro and Sharla? Couldn't be better :)
5:42 SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH Riotoro chill
AFFABLE
Beautiful towns; can't wait to get back to Japan. Hopefully next year!
These places kinda reminds me of Tryavna (in my country Bulgaria), maybe because that town is famous for its woodworks and beautiful wooden houses.
Thanks for another great video, Chris! Now I got another place I need to add to my "to go" list when I finally get to Japan.
Nagano is where I want to go to study, this fall for the end of the year. Hopefully I can save enough in time!
00:53 Why is this elderly Japanese man in every scenic backdrop in every video?  Is he the minister of tourism?
2 videos in one week!? It must be CHRISmas.
Who else wants to see a "making off" for this video in which both boys are forced to endure hard labour to pay for their food?
These types of videos are the best
Nice thumbnail dude, keep up the hard work man.
Good thing Ryotoro is there because without him it would be a trip fully controlled by a Canadian vegan. And no one wants that.
Mr. Slurpee!  lol
Two videos in a single month?! you spoil us Chris.
The views are amazing
I've missed these videos
Very nice and amazing locations.  Just wondering how to keep warm in those houses in winter
20:20 woud you say... porchestra? ;)
May as well start one of those walk tour channels too.
Lovely towns, but honestly what blew me away was that seamless edit of the bear crossing across the background! 🐻
A vacation with the two big loves of your life, can't ask for more.
Im curious, how did you guys deal with paying the restaurant staff?
No one talking about the random bear scrolling along as they devour a fellow furry friend?! 😂
damn, now i'm craving soba...
❤ such beautiful pictures
<3
You've found your look - very nice.
that bear at 11:11 was terrifying
I'm so excited to see more travel videos! I love the older videos but it's also nice to see more updated videos post-pandemic (I still hesitate to say that tbh) to see what's new and what has changed. Keep up the amazing work!
How did you pay if you didn't bring any cash? Dine&Dash in Japan?Please tell me its not so!
I always love the travel videos! Please try to make more. "Journey across Japan" has become my comfort series. And who wouldn't love to have Chris, Risotorro and Sharla as youe travel guide?
Practically a meditation video. Lovely entry to the series.
We’re making progress. A romantic getaway with Sharla not Connor… I mean, Ryotaro is there but progress.
I think this type of video never goes wrong and I really love the bear edit LOL
That CGI bear looked really good! Lmao 🎉
12:45    LMAO
Are my eyes tired or did that bear look like it was actually walking inside the restaurant 🐻🍜
i now know ryotaro is a mushroom addict. he keeps mentioning it .
That bear walking across the screen 😂
Great video bruh,
So its Slurpy Risotoro now...
The slurp is only not disgusting when done by children.
Loved the jokes in this one! 😄
Big slurp + big reverb= WIN
I could never get enough of these travel videos, a slice of the past in a modern context showcasing the beauty that is Japan.
Just got back from Japan and videos like this have me planning my next trip already. Keep up the good work!
What a timely video! Was looking into the Nakasendo trail a couple weeks ago
Quite possibly some of the most STUNNING scenery I've ever seen! I live in a very bland and un geographically diverse part of my state and I'm so jealous of pretty views!
It really is nice to see more of rural japan.  Tokyo and the cities in general start to all kind of blend together and are a bit boring, as is yet another abandoned building.  More rural japan visits please!  Maybe even a farm or ranch or something like that.
Okay.
Very nice touch to have the car at the start playing Too much volcano
Another interesting and enjoyable video. Is the Nakasendo different from the Tokkaido? The towns look just like the Ukiyo e prints. I want to visit.
OMG that ninja @ 20:48 is such great editing!!
At first I was thinking a 3-person trip might be kind of awkward, but actually I can see how this was very beneficial to have a 3rd person to help with filming duties while the other two converse or show things off.  STRATEGERY.  Well done.
Yay Risottoro is back. (Yes i always understand taht when you say hsi name.
11:03 my god that scared the shit out of me
Never get tired of your adventures. Information and culture a wonderful sample size of Japan.
That CGI bear in the back threw me off so badly
A chad in Japan tbh
keep making these videos!
When can i expect the new hit series taken for garnted? Where you put our resident peace loving meditating pacifist monk in the most perilous of situations while you sit on the side and laugh while taking drone shots Chris?
Love these travel videos, so glad to see you posting more of these again <3
Chris....come on, putting Sharla in bear suit? 11:10
Holy, new upload already?
Paddington would taste like Marmalade.
Lol
11:03 NICE job editor
The bear in the background lmao
Ryotaro still solos you
Oh hey it's Englishman in Japan! Keep up the good work Chris
Chris: Have you ever had gator tail? if you are ever in the southern USA (FL, AL, LA, MS)... I recommend giving it a try. Very chicken like.
Love the vibes of these videos!!
YOLO
I love these sort of almost calm travel videos, gorgeous scenery and sharp repartee
Hey bro, you're looking SLIMMER in that thumbnail! e: In the video too :D
You're an inspiration. Love the way you film your videos!
Chris on a journey becoming a ninja
Leaving a comment for the content engagement algorithm
Aye Nosotros Papaya to you my friend
Thanks for the video. The sound engineering is improved? It sounds good: There is little noise from outside while you are walking around and narrating.
I like Beer and I like meat. But bear meet? That's crazy.
Another walking/exploration video (I adore the previous one because it's like an adventure) plus Risotto returns. 2023 is starting off well for this channel. Looking forward to more videos!
Ryotoro third wheel LOL 😂😂
Another video already?? Yooo im so excited for this, definitely some of my favorite places in all of Japan, how is it that perfect looking??
For years the Nakasendo has been popular with tourists from The Netherlands. Great video!
Oi
I wanna live in that traditional town
Walking the Nakasendo trail is a life goal for sure, so insanely beautiful
uff... i loved ryotaros room more than the super modern one. both are really nice tho. but bath outside FTW
Finally Chris could escape!
What the fuck Ryotaro 😂
Well made as always, Chris- the edits were bearly noticeable
i see chris and ryotoro keeping the "chris is left handed and ryotoro isnt, so lets sit in a way that we bump arms while eating food" tradition alive
always love these type of videos from chris
Ryotoro had the better room.
yay for more Abroad in Japan uploads!
Leave it to Rizzotoro to make a comment that might cross the demonotize boundry.
hey man great video, but the audio sounds a bit off
That bear was scarily realistic. 🐻
Affable in japan
Yes. I've been there with friends in 2017, hiking a day trip from Magome and taking the bus back. I still remember ringing the bear bells and eating horse sashimi in the ryokan 😆It's a fond memory. Thanks for taking us with you to this nice area of Japan.
I would love an affable room with faffable characteristics
Love this new video frequency! Getting my fix of AIJ
really look forward to your videos Chris, MORE uploads :)
always a great day when you upload! cheers Chris :)
What a lovely looking place 😊
1:23 poor little mx-5
I was JUST thinking that it's been awhile since we've seen Ryotaro, but I'm so glad he's back :D Not to mention Sharla is also here! Also huzzah another video~~~
Love the subtle shoutout to Ektar 100... one of my favourite films to shoot.
These drivers and their bumping ASO.....
2 videos in less than a month. Amazing.
I know people have been saying it a lot, but you’re exercise plan is really paying off. It’s always great to see someone accomplish their fitness goals.
Sad these don't do as well, fingers crossed this one gets through!
Love this series. I can almost hear Quinlin's steepling his fingers, "Yes, Chris...walk more! You'll be hiking more before you know!"
Im surprised u dont seem to be wearing jackets! I thought japan is cold in the winter...
We all know what Connor would be doing with the bathtub - resting and enjoying the view.
that country looks beautiful
Japan's map looks like a nice steak. That just me?
"She loves the Slurp." I can't even 🤣🤣🤣
Mr slurpy
"She loves my slurp."  🤣 My man! 👊
Great video as always Chris. 2023 is off to a great start already!
Nagano is amazing.  If I ever move away from Okinawa, Nagano is near the top of my list of places I'd love to live.  My first time to Nagano, I went to a small izakaya with a client and ordered "kujira bacon".  I thought I was ordering quail eggs wrapped in bacon which is awesome...but that was the day I learned "kujira" means "whale".  0/10 - it was gross.
That first Ryokan was insane! I can only hope to stay in a place that nice
I love escaping from a busy city to a secluded area for a change of pace
Ryotoro slurp 10/10
What are you running from?
Another video this week my god we have been blessed😂❤
Im green with envy, nakasendo is on my bucket list!
Another video this week my god we have been blessed😂❤
great video! you use the BEST music
I was litterally thinking yesterday "why hasn't Chris done a video on the Nakasendo?"
Spoiled with all the videos lately!
“How does your wife put up with you?”  “It’s my slurp”  That came out of left field and caught me completely off guard
I love that you're uploading more recently. I have been watching your videos for years. You represent Japan so well, it gives me wanderlust. You're awesome! Great video!
Let's goooo!!!
Hey Chris
Is Ryotaro the camera man or the 3rd wheel? Both? 🤔 Lol 😂
2 videos in a week? ,I'm in heaven.
Lovely.
It's always interesting to see these kinds of places that many tourists may never know about
Abroad in a schedule
Ryotoros waifu is very lucky lol
Between the Joey, Connor and Gigguk...I ike Chris the most.
Oh hey, it's "Whining William" I love this guy! pretty darn affable actually....
Poor Sharla, third wheeling Chris & Ryotaro. Luckily she didn't find him amongst the fossils in England 😅😉
Yes! love when ryotaro appears
I miss these types of videos Chris!  The good old days when you and Natsuki would drink and laugh too. ❤❤
the garden looked so peaceful
A home cooked meal in front of me and a new video from chris, what more could I ask for??
Hooray for more videos!
Your content keeps getting better and better, congratulations. The fanbase very much appreciates it.
I love the new theme of walkning everywhere! Walking across Japan when??
Bankrupting political rivals by making them stimulate the economy, that’s genius
That looks amazing. Might have a goal on where to go for my next holiday.
Since when does Chris watch Naruto?
something is up with the mic, idk what but audio is different
Chris never misses with the content
I clicked at once when I saw this video.  I love this new exploring/walking series :D
Perfect timing for lunch 😊
Always a good day when Chris uploads.
Chris in the thumbnail looks like he's getting handsome as time passes since his older videos thumbnal made him look a little "older"?
Nice to see Pete last time, and Sharla and Ryotoro this time 😊 Will Natsuki, Connor and Joey join you during the other videos in this series?
I'm so glad to see more of these walk around Japan videos! Super nice to get to see more of daily scenery and life in Japan!
4 days since the last video- this feels weird, so ungodly weird-
The return of risotto man!
For the past few days, I had been binging Chris's previous videos and streams. I am so glad that you came out with another video and that too so fast, a video with Rissotoro and Sharla no less!  P.S. I am loving these walking type videos!
Nice of you to take both your girlfriend AND your sugar daddy on this trip.
CAPTAN CHRIS HAS RETURN  THESE VIDEO NEVER GETS OLD
2 videos in a week?! It feels like Christmas already!
Yess
Ryotoro and the mysterious meats
🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃
Two uploads in the same week?! Chris has blessed us all :)
2 uploads in 4 days, Chris has blessed us
SHEEESH really spoiling us with these bombass vids
At least Chris and Sharla and Ryo are having fun in this video
Is there a reason why you use a more western pronunciation and Sharla uses Japanese when pronouncing Ryotaro's name? Just curious from the last pod. Excited for the video!
So cool to see how fit you’ve gotten in the past year!
I love that treck.
great to see ryotaro (and his impressive slurp) on the channel again!
Finally a return of Risottoro my hero. First video in a long time worth watching.
Yaaaaay Ryotaro is back! :D
Noice Chris
Always really nice to see an Abroad in Japan video show up in my notifications. Really can't wait to see what's in store for 2023. Love your videos Chris.
Hello Chris
2 Chris Videos in a Week LET'S GOOOOO
Honestly,  your videos could be made by a professional documentary crew. I can't believe how much you have improved in the last few years. Amazing!
Two videos so soon back to back!!! Chris is cooking something special this year
Hello from Taiwan, Chris! Hope I can make it to Japan one day~
Mr. Affable pls like my comment.
More walking. I like it. If I can make the trip, I’d like to spend much of the time strolling.
I am indeed a part of the Notification Squad and while it is sad that this content does not perform as well, I'll watch anything with chris in it as long as his shirt stays on
Good old travel videos, I don’t know about other people Chris but these are my favorites amongst all your top notch videos 👍
