we all know you enjoy wearing the dresses
Damn im the latest comment in 4 years on your most pop vid
Boy, bye! 👋🏼
Now you need to make a video coming out as an abuser! Oh wait...
i still laugh bc colossal pointed out the blue teeth thing 😭
we need u back bro fuck the controversy
"So that was a fucking lie"
aaaaaaaaand he's an abuser.
Why was he dating the girl then?😂😢😅
4:13 damn….
Hm
The fact ur white and use the word "clarp". Uhh is this dude hate himself or what didnt realise we couldnt say clarp
Coming out... as an abusive piece of shit?
Yet this same person uses gay as an insult?
1:22, well!
Aged like milk
Who's here after he was exposed
You didn’t come out as  your true abusive self
…as an abuser!
1:23 did not age brilliantly
Coming out as an abuser
Coming out as an abisive arsehole to be more accurate
I don't believe this for one minute. Clout Goblin. The famous Internet sensation celebrity will say anything to maintain
I think you're adorable
"You're a knob off camera" haha that didnt age so well...
Lizzard
Always the virtue signaler....
As an abuser?
Here we are gathered today
@1:20 oof! well, THAT didn't age well! Lol! 💀
Ew good he got exposed
yo he really is like john lennon
And here we have imallexx coming out for the 32nd time 😂
.....
4:26 uhh buddy... that is 6 (including this one) not 8. Surprised your editor did not fix that.
0:35 what did he mean "the fact you are white"?
Bros eyes are fucking light up/pos
i love that darkness reference
WE LOVE YOU ALEX YOU ARE AWESOME!!! <3333
I find it so sad that hating bi people has become part of amour culture. Respect to you Alex man!
Omg, go back in Alex,  we can't cope with you out!
You look very pretty.  Something about perfectionism is that it's not good.  There's always somebody better than you, and somebody who's worse. You're just fine.
Hi Alex, 1st of all thank you for all the joy you are creating. you are hilarious. I am going backwards and watching all of your videos. Each one of you guys has slightly different twist of humor and makes your interactions priceless. I know this video is for 2 years ago but just couldn’t hear you saying you are (were) depressed and just pass by. Idk how you feel inside but to me in your recent videos you look much happier and I deeply hope you feel the same inside. No one deserves to be depressed and above all, who brings chuckles out of others in this chaotic life. I don’t think it be far from truth to say we love you and we are here to listen So just talk away…😊🤗
His eyes are beautiful in this, so blue!
i am cristain and hold deep southern values but i do not judge people and never have alot of people think cristians hate gay people but tbh a true real honest cristain who really reads the bible and follows the word doesnt jugde anybody and loves everybody unconditonalyl regardless of there views or beliefs or who they like. anybody who tells u you are going to hell or anything like that for being gay is not a cristain or a follower of god, they are a piece of shit person who makes real cristains look bad and give us a bad name..... I love u and ur content bro
awesome mate 👍
I don't understand why people feel they need to come out ... Like anybody else actually cares about your sexual preference? that's insane to me... Push people should just keep their sexualities to themselves it's a personal private thing keep it that way
What is that trim
What is that trim
What is that trim
What is that trim
What is that trim
These all look like statements 😅
Im bisexual and i find you dreamy 😍🥰👿💋
0:40 slightly racial that slur is mate. Us black people don’t own the word clart, and the fact you labelled it as a black persons word and it doesn’t have the best meaning is basically hating towards dark skinned people
So close to 300.000 subscribers
So, did he come out without coming out?
dude when did he come out like?
He ain’t lost his love for YouTube he’s just got a sense of humour about himself he’s not likely to laugh at just anything he’s got a brain
Good on you for being loud and proud and genuine with your homosexuality now try be loud and proud and genuine while apologizing to slazo...... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
feel like this whole video he was being entirely sarcastic. but i cant tell-
Mad this was 2 years ago, I saw this when it first came out and it just showed up on my recommended
He’s on a nob off camera ! So sick of this we’re here we’re queer crap if they want equality then shut the fuck up and be miserable and insignificant just like everyone else
"I'm happy, no I'm not" thats me every single day
:∆
The hair is alright
this video feels so much older than a year wtfff
love your hair alex yes
love you alex yes
Why are his eyes so blue
Bruv, I hate it when you're in a room with people and it's dead silent, it drives me insane, which is probably why I annoy my mom and siblings when watching a movie I like too comment through the movie because the silence really bothers me
y dont u "come out" with ur hands up alex we found the cp
well done, so proud of you  UwU
lol craig
Alex just be you. Thats good enough. I love watching you it always cheers me up. Don't ever shut up.
Jesus your eyes are so blue. They are so pretty lol
I didn’t know he’s bi omg yessss
ayy
where did he say he’s bi
Love the sinner hate the sin We love you alex but...
30 secs in "have no friends". Well you had one until you falselly accused him of phedofilia and ruined his life . Coming out takes courage and its comentable . The same is true for admiting your mistakes and apologising .
I thought you were straight until I saw you in the lgt hoodie then I thought you were lgbtq or just a really tone deaf straight guy
Was George the one who bullied you :/
bro you look fancy in that dress !!
Fuck em just be who you want to be and that's just genuine. I hate people too so your not alone and a best friend what is that?
alex reminds me of a young jimmy saville
i enjoy seeing him in the dresses.
“but i’m happy😀…. no im not”
Those eyes are incredible
Pogmeister
As cheesy as it sounds, you being open about your sexuality makes it feel more normal for me to be bi. Even if the people around me don't accept me.
dont care + didnt ask + ratio
That’s kinda gay
I’ll be honest; I’m not used to gay people. I’ve not interacted with many. For that reason, seeing gay people being touchy-feely around me makes me slightly awkward, lesbians too.  I’m not anti-gay though, I’m not homophobic. Good on anyone who is brave enough to stand up and say “this is me!” Most people who give others grief for how they are, simply do it because they’re insecure about themselves. They build themselves up by tearing others down.
ha gay -a pansexual trans man
I enjoy appreciating someone's company in silence and just enjoying the moment, but it has to be with the right people
Ha Gayyyy!
unsubbed
coming                   out
Alex don't worry about negative people I'm a fan of yours, I love your reactions, I love u to bits in a friendly way, I'm a straight guy no judgement here I would love to be your friend because you are cool, Down to Earth, funny and amazing and wholesome to watch, all the best for your future content, much love brother!
gay
Oh thats why he had something on his pants while watching james charles back then
Gay
I’m havin struggles comin out but my mam will 110% think I’m just attention seaking lol
I’m I’m late but lessssss goooooooo
I think we could tell your gay
Hi Alex, you probably don’t remember me, but I remember you. We went to school together, more specifically, we went to Ashley together. Please correct me if I’m wrong, but from what I recall, you were the bully in school. Particularly, you bullied me and some of my other friends. The reason I bring this up is because I think it’s important that you as an influencer own that truth. I realise now that we’re in our 20’s, and likely a lot of your bullying was due to internalised homophobia. I’m not looking for anything from you, honestly I don’t even care if you reply or apologise, I just wanted to give you my two pence after a friend sent me this video.
Clickbait
That’s gay.
Alex: I'm not straight  Me:same Everyone else: we know 😁😁😁😁😁😁🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
at least he aint accused another innocent guy of being a pedo yet
Nice
You are not special

BEANS
Bi boys for life ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜😎👍.  🏳️‍🌈
I feel like it's kinda hard to find many bisexual creators I enjoy watching like you and as a bisexual girl myself, this just makes me prouder to be part of this community. Congrats! And sorry I am so late lol 🥳❤🏳️‍🌈
hey! i know you won’t see this but i recently realised i was bi! bi squad!!  💖💜💙
You're kinda a wanker of a person Alex but glad your confident enough for this. Being straight I can't even begin to imagine it's a big thing to come out with.
You’re a bottom... And then you’re the loudest eboy... Back to back like that eh?
THE STRAWBERRY DRESS AAHHH!!!!!❤️❤️❤️
Your eyes are so beautiful  And you rocked the f*** out of that dress
The dress he has on in this Im literally getting that just in black but saw it pink like that but wanted to get it in blck and now i see he has it and i was talking about getting this dress 2 weeks ago now i found this god

Why do u look cute in that strawberry 🍓 top just say alex
When people think us gays only do the seggs
bruh
Wow Your so brave it’s definitely  not like you blatantly said that you are gay in the pass I’m not saying it’s a bad thing but every one makes this huge thing on coming out just for attention it’s 2021 who the hell cares it’s not 2016 any more were people was edgy every minute.  I know I’m contradicting myself but we need more people come for cementing the acceptance of the LGBT+ but in your case yeah no one cares.
The “I’m a knob *on* camera” got me dead
.
Your valid mate. I'm bi too. 💖💜💙
I subbed in the first minute when i watched one of your vidz😁, hope you have a good day
He kinda cute tbh yeah I have a fortnite pic as my pfp. Relax I couldn't find anything else

Yo babes
Why are your eyes so blue
No fucking shit
"Your too scared to get a hair cut".....
IS HE GAY
As  a pan  gender fluid person   People  say all the time i can't be  And well You Really make me happy when watching your YouTube   makes me laugh so thank you for posting
God what is it with bisexual people wearing strawberry pattern dresses😩😩
AYYYYY YOU GOT THE STRAWBERRY DRESS✨✨✨

I feel like you shouldve been a member of The Inbetweeners 😅
Somebody's gotten into the Spice Melange
Hi
Big gay Alex
🔵     🔵      👄 🍓👚🍓
Is Alex not straight ?
I always knew he was trans
Gayyyu
Not again 🤦‍♂️
please i love you bye
coming out as pyro fan
Bruh you’ve got a lisp like wisp
Alex: I am the most unfulfilled person on the planet  Me: Finally, a worthy opponent. OUR BATTLE WILL BE LEGENDARY!
How tf you still can make videos after Slazo idnk.
so.... is Alex a bottom or not?       *we need answers*
Slazo
alex: 💙👄💙
Congratulation! ❤
Good for you mate
1:07 omg that's so sad
I can't bare staying in a room with people when they aren't talking either
I like your dress 🥰

Wtf is up with this dudes hair, looks like Zebedee from football factory
Love the strawberry dress
No hate but u have went through so many hair cuts 😂💅
pain
i love that he wears the dresses it’s so cool
3:13 well there goes my anxiety
Why do you seem so depressed
Agreed. Silence is annoying and awkward and I always have to fill it in with music or YouTube videos just playing in the background🤣
Batty man
I want to come out as bi but i also dont want to get attacked in the street soo
*n o i c e*
i feel like since alex came out, he’s been a happier person with himself. im not saying everything is sunshine and rainbows, but now that everyone knows — i feel like he’s able to become easily satisfied with the things gets done and is going to keep doing. he’s making plenty of changes for the better for the better of himself and i have massive respect for that.
90% of this video was a phat mood ngl
amig0p
Buck from Ice Age... that’s where I know you from
wait you didn't tell people you were lgbt? I thought you told everyone, I never really watched your vids though I just thought it was obvious
State of u , u look gay
kinda gay ngl
Kewp er' coming Al
Gey

Long term plan is to grow this channel and eventually make it your main?
alex putting in that one clip of him playing football to prove that he’s good in like 7 videos is a mood
nice cloths man you got style
you are gay is that a jojo reference
Best Eboy because he is called Alex, I know from experience :^)
You always remind me of the guy from umbrella academy the one who talks to the dead
Does anyone know where the clip of Alex playing football comes from?
BOY! Your eyes, you accent (are Brit or somewhere over there?), your everything! I'm a Mexican guy in love with you. Cheers for this joyful vid!
Oh nigga u gay!! 😂
Alex clart is a Scottish word.
Stfu
Not gonna lie that thumbnail is pretty gay
I think i like alex more after watching this vid
hi alex! where did you buy the dress? i'm just wondering since you look snazzy :)
yukk
cutting out the answer to the bottom question only proves that you are a bottom, alex im sorry
WAIT. IS THAT THE STRAWBERRY DRESS??????!!!!!! THE SAME ONE THAT ERET HAS????!!!!! AHHHHHHHH CROSS OVER OF THE BISEXUALS!!!!!!
Someday I hope you happy and relaxed because I don’t know where I would be without you Thank you Alex 💖

Your eyes alright?
Your eyes are ocean manhhh
Hi Alex I’ve been a subscriber of your other channel for years and I love your content but it did start to feel like you weren’t so content with it anymore because those videos clearly take a lot of time and energy to produce. I’m so excited about this channel because it seems more yourself and I just feel like this is a little safe space so thanks so much! I hope you’re well!
Such beutiful eyes
tbf im the same on the whole silence thing. overthinking sucks ✌😗
Bro they have to be contacts 😳

Coming out as a boring idiot.
Apologize to Slazo and all the other people you've stabbed in the back and made false claims on.
I have the same thing about being quiet with the gnawing in the brain and everything. Its nice to know I am not alone
Win for the boys       Even though we already knew so we have stayed winning

Love you bae
💜
Well done Alex 😁😁😁

Wait, if Alex was bullied at school and went to school with belle delphine.......
I need the strawberry dress...NOW
I’m gay 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩
Alex has discovered a filter to fix his insecurity about his eye colour damn you could see how pissed he was that people preferred George's eyes in his eye reveal
Wtf is ur eyes bruv
Shit hair mate
Hello Alex How are you today? I hope you and your family are keeping safe from the virus? Keep up the good work on your channel sir. Also Merry Christmas And A Happy New Year
Haha u gay me gay too (rally the gays )
You've said you were bi back in 2019. Don't exploit the LGBT for views
Bruh this was obvious
Respect to this guy
alex: 🧿👅🧿 “i bisexual x14”
i love you alex :( ur so wholesome <3
Gay
blue gatorade eyesssssss
I always knew he was fruity
Please like me
Am I the only person who didn't know
Didn't you already come out like 3 years ago?
is that the kid laroi
I literally am the exact same with silence like I was once in a lift with my friend on a uni open day and it was so silent I burst out laughing because I was so uncomfortable
No
No matter what, I gotta say: the editing is on point, my dude
congrats alex!
George is still a nonce
You’ve come out more times then Trisha Paytas has
Cuuute! Glad you are back <33
So proud of you for standig up for yourself! Congrats <3 #LoveIsLove
the extortionately priced strawberry dress of my dreams 🤩👑
gay
I'm proud of you <3
no one asked 0w0
Dude, you already came out as bisexual in your other channel.   I'm pretty sure that most people already know this by now.  Edit: Never mind, this aged poorly.
How much more milk can you get from being gay? Fuck man a few videos a few tweets. The only thing you are attracted to is money.
When people think being gay must mean you have to be feminine, please-
Topic of the video coming out ✨everyone but his eyes thooo✨
screw anyone who is disgustingly rude to you about who you are. You are still a great content creator!
his eyes are extremely blue
Com in me
i want that dress!
3:01 It's clearly Will, not Alex
Is it just me or did he not talk about coming out at all?
This gives me insane frazer from bad education vibes
holy shit!!!!!!! i'm so suprised!!!! it's almost like you haven't used it as a excuse 1000 times!!!!
4:19 and i felt that
Guys im coming out in imalexx video i am a lesbain thanks thats all
I'm not Bi or Gay I'm straight but you kinda cute man
ayyy pablo ramirez yelling out “goooooooooooo”
OK we’re all agree that Alex in the strawberry dress is the most serotonin possible.
U slagged Glasgow !!!!!!!
Thank you. That's all
The dress over the hoodie is a fit
why is this my new favorite video of yours
So proud
nice work
You're a lovely person. You make life better
That’s gay
rumor has it he's still wearing that dress
alex you literally came out 4 years ago but im not judging, get them views lmao
Miniminter n ksi jelous of u n memeulous rn
mmmmmm video in recommended? must click it then & get angry about & type mean comments cause it's not my fault for clicking the video, youtube made me do it!!!!!!!!!
When I saw the title I was like finally
"Giving up, giving a fuck."  Is a quote i should get tattooed.
I thought you were gonna come out as gay 😔😂
I stan you so much especially after this
i love your teeth, i wish my teeth were shaped like your's, im so jealous
Huh
so you are gay? nothing new. move on
2:58 killed me! 😂
didn't you already come out
BENDER
Wdym single? What happened to Lewis??
Do Alex and Eret know eachother? Strawberry dress
💜
Finally a male bisexual, we are few and far between compared to female bisexuals
Alex: wears the strawberry dress  The Eret: *The day I lost my identity*
Your amazing and let nobody push you down
Glad your coming out :)
Why is everything rainbows
ello alex, im so proud of you and I love seeing you happy it's the cutest shit ever
So we can all prove George, James and Will aren't homophobic
And here we are again, me being attracted to alex and will forever cry about it.
I had to watch 3 times before I found him discussing sexuality because sexuality discussion is normal on my lovely non homophobic side of the Internet that I'm so lucky to have found
I hate quiet places now all my friends think i have adhd
not how he has the strawberry dress i- king shit
Fun fact that no one asked for, I'm bi as well 🏳️‍🌈👄🏳️‍🌈
OMG THE STRAWBERRYDRESS
Lmao why are people with 1950’s beliefs here doe         Just let people be what the want Jesus Christ
I love these type of videos they r so chill!!!
I love this
I also dislike silence and I can't stop talking it's one of my biggest faults everyone I know says I talk to much so this will now be my excuse
Excuse me mrs tik toker that said this video is wrong because it’s apparently click bait you don’t get mad when jay station makes a video about summoning a dead rapper you don’t say shit eh
YES!! YES!
Alex you try your hardest and it really shows! Keep it up!
i want that fcking dress so badly mate
I don’t understand why this comment section is full of homophobes
I’m sorry but I can’t stop acting up around Alex 👀
What's you size?
Mate I'm a straight male and I would wear a skirt sometimes :)
Omg I came out the same night December 30th. It went well
Me and my boyfriend hate gay people
👁️👄👁️ Alex slays in the dress
we love u bby <3
Why are your eyes so blue in this video
no i have been click baited
George at 0:30 :😢
ha gay
You where right I wasn’t subscribed fixed that mate
Wait I never knew he was gay or is he not gay I’m confused.
ALEX I HAVE THE SILENCE PROBLEM TOO. IF THERE'S NO NOISE ILL GO CRAZY
This closet must be crazy if you can come out this many times
Why does alex have a random dress? Doesn't he live with George?
I HAVE THE SAME FEELING WITH SILENCE
I can’t tell if ur wearing colored contacts or if u really have blue eyes, they’re too blue
I love an authentic Alex waffle 🥰
this vid was really funny i'm soo looking forward to seeing the new content on this channel!
i first saw Alex in an eboypodcast video and since then wondered who he was. and here he is-- on my recomended-
*ERET AND ALEX THE STRAWBERRY DRESS DUO.*
Yesssssssss
So...what is he?
Imagine boyfriend
I want that dress so bad but I’m poor😩
STRAWBERRY DRESS STRAWBERRY DRESS WOOOO
I WISH I HAD THE STRAWBERRY DRESS WTF
we know
IS THAT THE WILBER DRESS 👦✊🏼🤚🏾😯🥱🤧😶😲
Ngl the fact his face was out of focus the whole video annoyed me
Yeah I’m bi still haven’t come out mainly because I can’t be arsed
if alex dyes his hair blonde he can be prince charming from shrek
Alex alex alex...... dresses are cool n all but-please fucking style yourself the strawberries look like something a fucking kindergardener would wear
How did he get the Eret strawberry dress?
ok but seriously being bullied for who you love is so childish, its 2021 folks, get in already 😳😀
Alex is gay pog 😳😳😳😳
Him telling us to go away if we don't talk Me:I'm just shy
Love seeing Alex trying to be relevant again
"I'm authentic bAbYyyyy"
I also hate silence, but the kicker is that when I get anxious (like when it's silent) my brain freezes and I can't think of anything to say, which makes me more anxious and basically it's a vicious circle and we love to see it lol
Still so disappointed what you did to Slazo. And I was a huge fan of yours before I read up on the situation. Hate to unsub, but no toxicity this year🤷‍♀️
The podcast with tommy has changed him He heard "have fun" and he got shook all over again
I just wanted to say that you gave me the courage to come out to my friends and I haven’t been happier since
Crisp
No one carea

Out of all the YouTubers I watch Alex is the one I’d most want to be like genuine friends with
I didn’t realise how relatable alex is😃

I feel like Alex kinda looks like the lead singer from Blur
If I don’t talk I’ll die
u kinda look like bling bling boy
Alex in the strawberry dress
i know you were gay from the time you posted a lazy vlog
You have really nice eyes better than george
How did you know you were bi???
“I’m happy” *thinks about it* “No, I’m not”
I too am a knob at all times
Alex :D
Why are your eyes so blue
Most racist member of the eboy:imalexx
YOUVE GOT THE STRAWBERRY DRESS 🍓
Alex rlly said 🗨👄🗨
I absolutely love you so much. You, joshy, and memeulous mean the world to me. You are the reason I want to keep on going In life. Words can’t say how much I love you guys . Thank you guys for everything you do. Never give up and always be yourself 💕💕🖤🖤

I'm so proud
Good first eret now you with the strawberry dress. I love it so much
Alex why are your eyes so 🌀
being single is okay!!! people make it out to be not okay but it is honestly great to be yourself outside of a relationship! I would hate for anyone to feel bad for being single xx

I’ve got no clue who this mate is, but this video was so chill I felt compelled to sub and like. Honestly not sure, but aye keep up the good work 👍
As a depressed person, my room is a fucking mess. I havent had the mental willingness to do a thing.
i like his eyes a lot
you good?
This is one big cry for help dudeeeeee go to therapy
my tip for your hair, shorter at the back, longer at the front + messy fringe. don't do middle parts plz, ur hair is like mine as it doesn't hold shape so it ends up looking like a wet mop XD
Alex turning up the contrast to have sparkly anime eyes
Since no one is answering the hair thing, it doesnt look horrible it looks great✌
So he’s not gay
omg i love ur eyes but im confused- r u part of lgbtq or not?
Omg he really said 🧿👄🧿
Oh I thought you were gay lol
He looks like fraser from bad education but with smaller eyes
Alex your eyes look blue but abnormally 💙👅💙
is this the cast reveal for the next season of drag race UK???
We knew alex
Coming out: the sequel out 2021.
I miss the old Kanye, straight from the Go Kanye Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye See, I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye What if Kanye made a song about Kanye Called "I Miss The Old Kanye"? Man, that'd be so Kanye That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye [Laughter]
i swear im the only person here who didnt know alex was bi. like. did i just accidentally skip any video where he ever hinted or outright stated it to us all or like- or is this a joke- i- pls be true that would be so cool
Anyone know the song used at 0:35 to 0:51?
I’ve missed u

“i’m not straight.” fully support but uh- hasn’t he told us this like five times already baha
Okay but where did he get that strawberry dress I NEED. Lmk if you know :)
HE HAS THE STRAWBERRY DRESS DJSJEHDHDBSW
I believe Alex is the only youtuber I watch for personality and not content
Like the hair m8
i like this better!!!!! these videos are way nicer
This was a very nice chill video It made me smile :)
Little did i know Alex would wear the holy strawberry dress
Got to admit,  Youtubers being honest  like this is a rare sight. It's wholesome.
We all knew it
Your eyes are really blue if you’re not wearing colored contacts then what is happening
Yay
I wrote in that assumption box “i prefer memeulous over you“-
“I don’t have a best friend 🤷‍♂️” George: *kicks down the door holding a gun*
Glad to see a new video from you!
The colour filter gives you the drugged out eye look
I appreciate your content and the content even all your friends do (ya ebois and then ya know..... iNabber....lol) and I think you guys are genuinely just making youtube content and having fun. I also don't consider any of you problematic and never feel like wanting to off myself after watching one of your videos. LOL So thank you for being you. You took a break and I missed you here. Because you never make me upset even discussing big topics and honestly, we needed SO MUCH of that while you were gone.....so listen....don't leave again :P Take breaks, make sure you practice self-care.......but ya, we will be here waiting even if you take off for 4 months. :)
Omg you have THE strawberry dress!! Goals!! Beaut!! 🥰😍😍
Alex has 99 shooting
His Adam’s apple hurts my neck
You come out the closet more then I go in the fridge
Much love to you. 🖤💛❤️. Love what you do my darlin. You do you always. x💋x
How does Alex have my dream dress 😭
Is this Eret part two?
THE STRAWBERRY DRESS
Didn’t know this channel was a thing but I’m here for it ❤️ love you
It’s nice to see some actually original content from alex
My guy why do you sound like Ricky Gervais? Like you have the same mannerisms...I cant really explain it but please someone tell me I'm not the only one
ily but please apologise so i can go back to loving ur videos again </3
Look at you strawberry Alex 😩
Alex eyes look amazing
My sister came to me earlier and showed me this video, specifically you reading her assumption, and that alone made her really happy. Thank you for making my little sis happy, Alex.
Haha gay
Is this a cry for help ? Do you need help with depression? :/
alex fembooy
HOW THE FUCK DID HE MANAGE TO MAKE A DRESS ON TOP OF A H O O D I E LOOK GOOD?? THE FUCK??
To be on trending in 2020, just be gay
Alex I also hate silence your not alone. Also love your content
i really like this style of video!!!
hey, are you alright?  i know ur crackin jokes but r u actually like good...?   like im here if u need a chat, dm me on insta @katarinaknill lol like ik u prob think its dumb, and u obv dont know me but im here for u man.
your eyes have become fluorescent
I did want I wanted and disliked. Click bait
“Authentic baby” my favourite human in the world 😂😊
oh wow! Alex remembered the password to this channel
I think like loki you were born a frost giant
#30 trending
“Given Up, Giving A Fuck!!!!” Love it 🤩🤩🤩🤩
the strawberry dress,,,,,fucking jealous
nothing said about all of the fake allegations you made alex
Your eyes-
Raaasa so much clickbait
alex your hair is flatter than i want my chest to be please-
If you feel you could've done something better than you did, at least you tried! (this is short ik, but i just wanted to comment lol-)
i didn’t even mean to click on the video but i’d feel bad clicking off 😭
Alex is best boy
omfg deadass, i hate the silence. i thought i was the only one, but it's just horrible when it goes quiet lmao
Oh the strawberry dress wonder where have I saw that before 🤔
I love the strawberry dress so much but I can’t afford it :c
this just became my new comfort video
"You're a nob off camera" the assumption says "I'm a nob on camera" actually just a mood
Nobody cares, why is this on trending?
hair looks good
What camera do you use?
That's cool bro also who are you?
Well I, for one, think your haircut looks great
i totally understand the hating silence thing. my family is always annoyed because i either have youtube or music on like all the time, but i hate sitting in silence so much. they just think i’m addicted to my phone
1,000 comment was me uwu.
Bisexuality does not equal relevancy
1000
Coming out was a fuckin bitch. I’m a bi guy too btw and it hurt me for years. But it was so worth the pain for everything I have now. I have the most amazing friends, the most supportive family, and I actually had the courage to come out. I never knew for sure if I’d be able to do that, but I did. Love from one bisexual boss ass bitch to another ❤️❤️
I like your haircut Alex it fits you face its pretty
WHY DOES EVERY SINGLE YOUTUBER HAVE THE STRAWBERRY DRESSSSS
Gay
Good boy🔙https://youtu.be/Ik4phuXyHag
Wait why does alex remind me of joey from friends
ur hair is so pretty alex
Sees Title: George
Are you coming out as straight or something?
everyone who is bi has a strawberry dress apparently
Bit gay that init?
Literally Alex coming out for the 10th time we Stan that💖also quarantine is the BEST thing that happened to Alex’s hair😌
How have you got 80k subs...ur literally boring AF!
saying you hate silence and seeing people agree makes me feel better about myself cause I talk tonnes so there isn't silence and always worry people hate it
🔵👄🔹
That moment when u didn't realise this was a second channel
Ha gay
Omg he actually uploaded
I hope you find someone that you can experience a comfortable silence with. It's such a nice thing to be able to be in someone's company even when it's silent and have it not be awkward :)
Awkward silence make me want to fucking cry i hate it so much 🤠
Thank you
the most beautiful eyes have cried the most tears 😢 you all gud Alex?
🤢
Why is he coming out?
Are you the grinch or a goblin or elf or Gollum ?
Why is this shxt getting recommended to me?
Not sure why YouTube recommended this to me ...read the title and thought it was some little mincer coming out the closet...still no idea what this vid was about 🤨
i love every imalexx video, also a statement
Ewww
Anyone else not even know about this channel's existence until this video got reccomended
I think its lovley that you like wearing dresses I think the strawberries are very nice
HE'S GOT THE FUCKING STRAWBERRY DRESS ARE YOU KIDDING ME NOT FAIR
I genuinely enjoy this content. It feels more casual and chill and it doesn’t feel as performative (performative isnt a bad thing!)
Hello!I just wanna say that I love you and the Eboys,so,so much!You guys really make my day and make me laugh.Thanks for being such a fantastic youtuber,I love ya! (Platonically!)  •Plus,why the eyes so blue?Are you okay?
Flippen hell man did u inject sully into your eyes?
Nice click bait knob
I'm the exact same way about silence. It gives me awkward tingles the same way people describe what ASMR does to them.
😲
As a serial false accuser of rape allegations
hope mans is doing aight.
alex eyes said 🌊👄🌊
Pray for this woofta 🙏
Coming out about being a backstabber???
May god have mercy on you
Big gay

** hey guys!Who else is trying to grow their YT channel during quarantine. Let’s help one another. Much Love
Who really cares if anyone comes out! What a self-indulgent attention seeking nonsense. Can I join in and come out? I'm straight I think all the straight people should start coming out then you'll realise how ridiculous you all sound! Nobody gives a flying toss about your sexuality. I'm banner Ng your channel
My coming out story is stupid....I took a guy to my school dance kissed him completely forgetting my mum was a teacher at my school....
he looks like buck from ice age 3
So wrong.
Pretends to be shocked
I didn't know this channel existed until now omg

Greta Thunberg has a Brother??? How Dare He! 😆😆😆
again lmaoo
His voice reminds me of the 11 year olds when they first enter high school and act hard to the older kids " CMON BRUV " " PUSSYO " my greatest memory of high school is when I was in year 10 and a kid in year 7 acting all hard tried to barge past me and he bounced back and fell over  LMAO
is your eye alright mate
So what's new?
ALEX HAS THE STRAWBERRY DRESS
wait why did i really like this video. like this might just fall into the very exclusive rewatch when stressed category
Excited for the future content, Alex! 💕 And the dress is so cute.
It’s 3am so I keep reading his name as Alex amiright
I loved this video! Nice and chill😌
wtf do you want from me?
https://youtu.be/-cHg7hwrV-Q
🏳️‍🌈🤢
Welcome back Alex 🔥
How to be on trending: 1) make a short title stating your coming out or you have "big news" 2) make a long as intro  3) cry or get emotional
Oh ffs another gay
if this is queerbaiting ill bake my phone into a pie
never seen anyone rock that strawberry dress so much before🔥
nah Alex I ain't subscribing to someone who accuses their mates of rape and paedophilia
Well you make sick content and I’m glad your back and You are and inspiring and you do you so you are a cool man 😁
Eye eye backs to wall from now on!!
YouTube Trending mods if you see this I expect better from you guys
Why u gotta click bait like that bro
Your actually cool. I never subscribed to people but I randomly found you and I'll subscribe because I think you're a breath of fresh air
We knew
He has the strawberry dress 😭😭😭
Didn’t ask
Its becoming obvious now that you aint straight, but we dont care what sexuality you are. We only care that ypu keep making content and your still the same humorous person you are!
Let’s hope we leave you in 2020
Unsubscribed.
-of my house          After lockdown
Why are you gay mate 👍
Welcome to the family alex ngl I kinda guessed when I first started watching the eboys and then watching ur vids u just give off the lil vibe and most members of the lgbtq+ community have what some us call the 'gaydar' but it dont just go off wiv gay ppl it goes off wiv all lgbtq+ ppl so yh love what u do man it's funny amazing and makes me happy to see ur vids especially when I had a shite day u and the rest the eboys make the day better. Sending all the best .  Also LOVE THE HAIR LOOKS GOOD 😆😊
Why not apologize for false rape allegations?
Alex's eyes are like the pure, azure sea of melting your troubles away and piercing blue shallows through the inner thought of the MIND.
I knew he was dating memelous
Ayooo that’s kinda gay
i love these kind of vids
so we’re all gay asf and bottoms here? nice
I came out of the closet as straight to my mum
Alex and his blue eyes ❤️❤️
Stop wearing blue contacts.
egg
Alex your haircut is beautiful
You sound like a Hospital Radio DJ.
billie wrote ocean eyes about alex
this made me happy :') i came out as bi to my family this year and i was nervous but it went really well !

Most people could tell you weren't heterosexual
That is one spumpy looking ikea armchair
/hug @everyone
Clart?
dresses on top of hoodies? sounds like a trend to me

You are my favourite E-boy memeber
Yo it’s himmmm
The editing thoooooo🤩🥳
This was fun to watch, bring on a better year for Alex in 2021
also that's the best dress ive ever seen.
not only am I the 700th commenter but also hell yee, Well done for coming out
Your eyes 😭🤭
Eyes
I wanna paint your nails ah...
Finally, gay clickbait
How shocking
Canceled
generally concerned   is your hairline ok?????????
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
U make me feel sick
Is he acc gay? Cba to watch the full video
Alex why are you so cool. You're just such a cool person
Is he actually bi? I’m confused
Well I clicked to Dislike Video

"I'm so depressed-" I cannot believe how hard this made me laugh because SAME "I'm happy... no I'm not-" ASKHSLDJRBR

I like your eyes.
Since when did you have a second channel
"I hate when people don't talk" Yes!! It gets so awkward if you're with multiple people and it gets quiet 😩
Say yes to the dress
Love the new filter, makes your eyes pop
Gaeeeeeee
Clart bit made me buss up
I knew he was a gay
Why is this trending😭
Keep being you Alex!!❤️happy new year!! 🥂
Well done Johnny Angel😂https://youtu.be/yvs15lnxqPk
sorry alex i joined ur Instagram live yesterday but i forgot about this video-
Did you come out tho?? I’m still confused
Alex should make a video showing off all his dresses
Persecution will never be a personality, your boring
Hey do you like epic montages. Do you like comedy. Are you a gamer. Are you a pro. Then check me out for the best life  God bless you 🙏🙏🙏🙏
The only sport Alex is good at is jumping in and out of the closet to confuse us
Ur gay bro pattern up
It was always obvious lets be honest
Oh god oh no it’s S2W all over again (jk)
1:27 I just about lost my house had I not bumped into this, Check it out just search for ., *f u n d a i l y p a y*
alex seems like such a fun person to chill with
Sir, sir.
Gay
Your awesome 💕
i’m not happy either bud. friends now. 👍🏻😭
i just flat out started commenting something then just got sick of what i was saying and stopped and posted it. ignore me rats
i cant h
Alex looks like a little girl in those happy country movies. Still cute tho
Dress tour? Like a little catwalk of your collection :)
Why eyes so blue BRIGHT BLUE
His eyes look really pretty 🥺
No matter what we all love u ❤️
mate try a buzzcut this isnt a roast itd look sick
But where is that dress from
technically 'can't stand silence' is Sedatephobic. :3 probly not to the phobia level i'd hope but it is essentailly what you described, Alex. :3
Liked that song !
Alex you’re great ! Keep up the great work !
Wait you have the strawberry dress?? That’s perfect
Wtf what? Why this channel The title Bruh
Being gay is pretty gay...
As an introvert Alex would probably hate me
You’re doing great :)
Love it all, more dresses!!
I love this style of video should definitely do more
this is the biggest cry for help i have ever seen
I watched two ads for you on this one. Enjoy an extra beer on me <3
You have a Reddit! i would love to see you react to it :)
Yeah your hair is cool
I love chill Alex, reddit reddit reddit
i forgot i subbed to this channel
Love the dress
What the fuck are you wearing contact lenses?
do this type of stuff on your main channel! i enjoyed this more than some of your main channel content (no offence) :)
Alex does feel a lot more relaxed and himself in this video, this is a Alex were much happier to see
Loved this, missed seeing you
alex: "I hate when people don't talk* me: "heh.. well i guess he won't like me then";-;
Versatility is the spice of life.
"You're the loudest eboy" Mate have you heard Will?
idk why this video was recommended to me but im glad I'm here😌
alex you look so happier 🥺
I actually just came out publicly as asexual today lol
I’m so proud and loveeee where your going with YouTube
epic
He didn’t even come out on this vid wat a click bate fair play
thats so interesting that you say you cant stand silence. i get that so much i used to feel the same way! but idk it changed for me because i kind of forced myself to try to endure the initial awkward feeling of it because i found myself always trying to fill the silence and that is so exhausting (which i still do a lot though its still a thing i actively try not to do) but i realize now that being silent with someone and like being ABLE to be silent with someone is so intimate and nice. like its not your responsibilty to fill the silence all the time. it really isnt. and just because youre not talking doesnt mean youre not enjoying each others company. at all.  to be able to sit with someone and have it be silent for a while is so powerful in so many ways. Its not that they dont want to talk to you or you dont want to talk to them its just enjoying each others company without the pressure of having to be entertaining all the time. cause you dont have to be. theres so much power and intimacy in just being silent for a while with someone. its awkward and weird at first but i feel the same sort of pressure and its good to try and let go of that. anyway love the video and the dress and I'm proud of you for posting and making the decision to post different stuff on here. keep going plss you have all my support and love always  <3
You ever just 🥺 watching Alex’s videos
king really said 🔵👄🔵
Your eyes are literally so gorgeous

I dont care what you are Alex just in general to all LGBT people dont be ashamed of being a bottom and be proud if your a top. there really are only three tops left in the world the bottoms are over running the world, there really are alot of us. lol

Bro beans, you do you! love your vids and courage.

Alex scares me because he’s reached lots of success with his career and has lots of friend but if still depressed and if I’m depressed now without that stuff.
I have had a terrible day at work and this has made my evening, raised my mood a bit :)
As a snake?
I really enjoyed this, I could see in the way Alex acted and edited he really enjoyed this more relaxed approach and it made such an amazing video (Not saying I don't enjoy his other content). Really looking forward to more videos!
Be your self's mate I love Ur vids Ur and inspiration to us all my friend
I’m loving this content man ❤️
Image getting a like from alex
when did you start a 2nd channel
he really skipped answering the “you’re a bottom” message as if we don’t all know that pretty much confirms the answer is yes
again?
Reddit videos incoming
Your bro also mocks you for being bad at fifa? .... same
Ur eyes are so blue. Love the dress
again?
alex, you are a beautiful human being, i am jealous <3
... how did i not know that alex owned the strawberry dress
do reddit vids
when alex looks better in the strawberry dress than i ever would😤😪
🧿👄🧿 hey
I like your hair cut though Alex
Very proud of you!
I didnt know you had a second channel, thank you for making easier for people to feel comfortable to be themselves tho I myself am bisexual and people like you make it easier ❤
omfg Alex in the strawberry dress is something I didn't know I needed😍😍
Love ya work
alex: im going to be uploading to this channel a lot more me: doubt
Eyrlorr everyone oim ollox
Um is your eye alright mate??
Ur gay
i wanna see a photoshoot w the strawberry dress
i feel like this will be the equivalent of the s2w channel and he’ll start doing reaction videos with george
Who else is really hyped about 2021 on this channel
Alex we love you, I’m begging you won’t stop posting because of the lack of views... we love you and will never stop. The views will come back. Love u always n we know Kavos is the prick not u❤️❤️❤️
Alex coming out again? He is really trying to be Trisha
I feel so cool being on this channel
3:40 i love this man
The editing is awful tbh
wait the strawberry dress?!?!? I'm jealous...
We all know you're a bottom give it up-
i came out as bi now i gotta come out as nb to my parents 💀 yikes
Im here at 2 hours how lovely
I love this video, very chill and still very funny! ☺️
I love everything about this video and content like this!!
U look like I'm alex
the second channel is back....
Gotta love a footballer that rocks dresses
Why are your eyes so goddamn blue lately?!
if alex is down i hope everything can turn around for him :)
Your eyes are really blue I hope you're ok
It was clickbait but like we already knew so
Enjoyable video. Thanks 👍
Top tier video
The production value wowowow welcome back
also, tHE DRESS OVER THE HOODIE FOR SOME REASON LOOKS FUCKING AMAZING
your haircut looks beautiful al<3
bi king
Love u in a dress Alex and a hoodie 😂😍♥️
I bet you're like 60% bottom 40% top
I love the posting random things , it’s almost nostalgic in a way
we all know youre a bottom
If you didn't like obsessive fans that'd be worrying because James Marriot told me I should make an Eboys shrine
this was such a fun video to watch🥺
strawberry dress! hell yeah
Are the YouTubers above u in those trash bags?
me: *sees title*  me: again?
I think his hair looks nice
so is he gay or not
Alex: I’m not straight Everyone: we know
So made up for you alex ❤
Omg you have the strawberry dress. Ive wanted it for so long
btw ur hair looks good
lies.
Missed you!!!
Alex looks like dobby 😱
Silly old you Alex and your second channel POST ON YOUR MAIN U SILLY GOOSE
Your hair looks amazing 😍😍
i need that dress
3:15 that’s some strong ADHD vibes lol
ngl i’m pretty jealous of the strawberry dress
no one:  alex: 🧊👄🧊
:))
This video was funnier than it had the right to be
You look cool in a very uncool clothes and hair cut....🤣🤣    I Likey
Keep up the good work man all your fans love you and your content 👍👍
This was really nice it’d be great if you want to do more videos like this ❤️
teal and orange
Hair looks peng
i love these little videos
You see my question is why do you care if he's a bottom or not it's none of your buissness and quite frankly I think it's quite invasive him skipping doesn't give you conformation it means he doesn't wanna answer do that with what I will
I think It really comes across when you enjoy what you're making. I love watching this type of video where it's just you turning on the camera doing whatever the heck you want. :)
thanks for making my christmas bearable ❤️
glad to see you back <3 hope you have the best 2021, you deserve it! ❤️
alex where did you buy this dress...? !!
Alex, you are every swag
Love your videos !
The contrast on this video is *F L Y I N G*
alex ur hair looks great don’t worry
⚠️bring back sims 4⚠️
I already knew
Everytime someone is biphobic, alex comes out again
why are alexs eyes so vibrant
I’ve tried coming out three fucking times to my parents and every time they invalidated me saying I’m not experienced. IVE HAD THREE MALE RELATIONSHIPS AND I HATED THEM. Like come on, don’t you read the signs?? Anyway me close friends remind me my sexuality and gender is valid.
ngl i actually like the side fringe better than the curtains but i love them both
Anyone from twitch remember epog?
OH I thought he changed the channel name for no reason haha
I like your hair♡ maybe could use a bit of thinning out so it isn't so abrupt, but I like it. I'm sorry you're depressed but I hope you throw those bags in the bin and keep your chin up!
Do you remember epog?
Andrew Applepie tunes 🥰
I think its cool that your back man, just don't feel pressured, not just pressure to upload or make it good, but also remember that we'd be happy just seeing you for even a minute, even if its a video with no context and your just talking (or being screamed at by George aha)
THE ERET DRESS! EVERY BI BOY WEARS A STRAWBERRY DRESS!
i feel like alex has come out like 47times
alexs eyes r so blue in this
I've missed this, glad you're back mate <3
hi alex i love your videos thank you for uploading!! 💙💙
My friend also really hates silence. It makes him uncomfortable and it makes him start to retreat. I never heard of anyone hating silence as much as he does until now. Now I must go share it with him lol.
yayyayayyayayayyyy
Alex likes wearing woman’s dresses  But he also can’t pronounce his ss
You and CallMeCarson would get along
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
Editing this good on the second channel? Yes please
Alex: Coming out... Me: He's STRAIGHT?!
Alex rlly out here making my horrible day a little bit better
Nice to see you happy
I saw the notification and I thought my mind made it up
From: 🔴👄🔴  to: 🔵👄🔵
this was really refreshing i haven't watched your vids in a while but i laughed a lot
The haircut is 🔥 my dude.
4:21 the pain in his eyes lmao
Wait he has a personal channel?? With less than 100k and I found it but accident??
Bro Alex in the dress just hits differently  😳
Shalom
animesexual alex
george is his bestie!! 🥺
The strawberry dress makes mE FEEL THINGS
Who tf hasnt subscribed yet?!!!!
Tell Connor we all think he is a great editor
I want a strawberry dress, don't be shy alex drop the shop you got it from lol
I love seeing that he's happier and I hope he is actually happier. Great video, I hope you enjoy making them again. I'm glad your making videos on this channel, I'm proud and you're doing great. The dresses are beautiful. Everyone's talking about how his eyes are so blue and I've been simping over his eyes for a long time. His hair is beautiful. Where's the pink for the microphone thingy.
Green eyes would suit your hair colour and skin tone so much moreeee
Your hair looks better now than it did, but ngl I couldn't tell the difference at first
mrs i’m not gonna do a second channel? fed up with the lies, unsubbed 👍
🧿👄🧿 < Alex eyes be like
so glad you're back! loved both of the videos ☺️
Post whatever you want, we’ll love it all <3
“i’m mentally ill” said very cutely, very on brand, and very relatable
are we supposed to be surprised
Alex comes out? What a shocker..
wow he's really flexing on us all with that lirika matoshi strawberry dress
i think i missed the time when 5min videos were a thing
Alex only kept the dress assumption in so he could flex his £500 dress to us.
the dresses are snazzy, looking dapper
Alex got 'em Paul Walker eyes
Actually Alex I really like your haircut.
reddit content incoming
why are your eyes so blue in this video
i also have two bin bags in my room, its fine xoxo
Bi god I ever would of guessed
I feel like this channel is a one to one chill sesh. I love it
Turn down the saturation mate you look like a colins key thumbnail
Love love LOVE this! The editing is off the scale, man! I'm glad you're back making content that you want to make and that you're happy with, well done Alex! :) <3
Alex,your channel is literally so therapeutic 😏
Wait is that the lirika matoshi strawberry dress??
tf, your editing has gotten so much better while you were gone
coming out is the best thing on earth
Alex we already know you're gay
Guys its not clickbait, he did say "Bi" at the end of the video 😤
honestly, the black bin bags in the corner are the biggest statement about how shit all of our mental healths are now- frick covid, frick Boris, frick society - yes I'm making that a clothing line ;)
This was such an interesting video loved it ur eyes are pretty love ur channel
ive spent over a year thinking ur eyes were green
wait are you actually bi?
Erets strawberry dress -
i am so famous omg
What  do you use to edit your videos 🤩🤩
alex is simply loud because he is the main character of the eboys
Responses when asked about relationship status   George "if I speak I am in big trouble"  Alex "worried I'll get myself in trouble"  🤔🤔🤔   (This is a joke)   2:56  4:08
your eyes are literally so pretty wtf 😭
Pop off, King. Glad to have you back 🙏🏼😍
alex really always looks like 🌊👄🌊 now adays
Really I never knew😂
mhm and the 'internet gaylord' hoodies in rainbow colors didn't tell us a thing 😁👍
I love this video! Honestly I just like hearing you talk about random topics, I find it interesting! so I cannot wait for these videos 😊❤
so proud of u al x
We all enjoy seeing Alex wearing the dresses as much as he enjoys wearing them          Edit: I came back to see 69 likes here nice!
bb everybody knows already
cw ALEX SPOILERS - - -  - -  HE'S NOT STRAIGHT????!!!?
yes second channel alex yes
who has nicer eyes? george or alex?    we all know it’s alex xx
as soon as i saw this i thought damn hitler would have got us all years ago (off topic)
Genuinely glad you’re making whatever content you want and not stressing yourself out for YouTube, you can tell you actually enjoyed making this video and I hope you continue making content like this instead of pandering ❤️
Sir u are so pretty

i read the title and was like alex... we already know that
The editing on this video is 👌👌😌

Ok but your eyes are scary mate, you look like ruddy Gollum
You should just use this as a shitpost channel where you do stuff like this, reddit videos, Q&As ect
We know your not straight babes x
i love how chill this got to the point where u were sat wearing a hoodie underneath a strawberry dress lmao
e y e s

I love your hair and if anyone wants to dissagree with me then ill fight you 😂🥺💗👍
Your hair look amazing alex <3
yaya
Now that’s something I bond over Alex with, I can’t stand when people don’t talk. I find it so hard not to be doing something especially talking. Its so hard to actually stay quite in any situation I’m just glad I’m not the only person who does this lol.
lol
Alex you actually did really well with your hair :0
‘I’m authentic babE’
I am generally so so glad you are posting on YouTube again!!
