Pne are dirty barstewards, paid the price in the end😂😂😂
Junior firpo 🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴
Junior 🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴
I cant  belive  my classmate walked out  with the leeds :⁰😊
How can anyone sat that wasn't a penalty 🤷
Who knows what happened to the kid who ran on the pitch at the end of the game
Gruev
Grandissima vittoria nel finale,  avanti così Leeds! 👏👏👏💪🤍💙💛
Its amazing how anger can blind you. Im sure when Ryan lowe calms down, calms down , he will admit to himself he's a twat. 😂
Why does the PNR continue argue?? Their manager says it hit his body first...?the replay clearly shows it didn't.... don't they know replays exist or something????
Typically, after scoring...1) Dan James prefers celebrating alone 2) Crysencio Summerville prefers celebrating with Wilfried Gnonto 3) Joel Piroe prefers celebrating with Georginio Rutter AND The Whole Stadium 😂😂
The cunts we’re after Dan James from the start
It wasn’t a great penalty pretty weak effort fortunate keeper went the wrong way if he had dived the other way would have been an easy save.
Best side won and kicking lumps out of us lost.  Try play football next time Preston and you might win
I hope that Leeds United make it back to the premier league next season
Did Ayling make it?
Preston are the most delusional and pointless football club in the country.
Are we at last beginning to see the real Firpo? Looks class on that wing...
❤
Sweet revenge, PNE baited Meslier and got him sent off .... so cry about our penalty goal lolz.
Preston were lucky last time and cheats this time. Late goal, but it was the very least we deserved. God knows how he dares show his face, but the cherry on top was Ridsdale in the crowd, chewing a wasp 😂.
Interesting to hear that Leeds have pinpointed norwich for an easy 3 points on their way to auto promotion.  Disrespectful and arrogant to say the least .  On a different note as a canary we can only say many thanks to our best manager over the last 30 years . Looking forward to saying hello to your supporters in midweek.
Piroe taking penalties <3
That was a terrible penalty shot. Piroe got lucky.
FairPlay gutted 😞 that pne conceded the penalty    It was good atmosphere in the way end very loud is well
JUNIOR FIRPO, since he’s been back, 1 goal conceded, 4 assists in 3 games, most in the Championship.  That defending, eh?  Long may it continue!
Preston were horrible.
Preston have to be the dirtiest team in the league surely!
Preston didn't come to play football. The Ref must of come on the coach with them. Lol. He was terrible
Come on Leeds! Fighting for promotion, hope you get it.
Penal regalado
After all the disappointments and injuries Patrick Bamford has had wouldn't it be great if he scored a few more and had a great (rest) of the season. Both for him and the supporters of the club. It takes a lot of inner strength and commitment to keep on trying when things go wrong and people are doubting you.
That was harsh on Preston.  They deserved a point in this game.
02:02 Me when Burnley lose 5-0 instead of 8-0
anti-football lost today
My team heading back to the premier ooh i pray to u Lord
Very cynical Preston side today. Whole hearted team though, so respect
I,ll always love leeds,
Great cross Firpo. Class.
Think preston rocked up at the wrong stadium today....Headingleys about 6 miles away. Shocking way to conduct themselves & mirrored their attempts to kick us off the pitch on boxing day. Only 1 team trying to play football out there. So glad justice was done in the end.....just amazed they finished with 11 on the pitch. Shithouse of a team ✌️🟦⬜️🟨
Get in Big Jon celebrating with Daniel James in the corner! MOT ALAW
Summerville⭐⚽️
Rutter and Firpo should appeal their yellow cards. The ref was absolutely abysmal today. Like shockingly brain dead awful!
Great revenge for the previous away game against this dirty team. Love that it was a last minute penalty that won it too 😂
Well done Leeds, hope you go up. But not at the expense of the mighty Saints
Filthy, filthy, PNE and their deluded manager who claimed in his PMI that he was proud of his team.
Lots of positives here but could have been 2 points lost ….How many yellow cards did Preston get ? Summerville James and Rodin are the bedrocks ….I still see Bamford missing chances and getting too easily shrugged off the ball …Rutter loses possession and his efforts on goal are most times weak but at least he takes them on . Let’s keep closing the gap on those leaders!!
I'm not a Leeds fan - but they play some exciting football. James and Somerville - talk about creativity !!
That is what  Preston  get  FOUL AFTER FOUL AFTER FOUL!  Get lost you clownssssssss  MOT
We are a different proposition than we were a month ago
Preston dirty w**kers
and at the end not one preston player shook the hand of the ref  speaks volumes about preston
Gk 🎉
Albo jestem ślepy,albo ten faul był kilka metrów przed polem karnym. Pytanie:czy ja zwariowałem,czy sędzia?!!!...Aha, oglądałem to wiele razy,a sędzia tylko raz i bez powtórek...Rozumiem, że u was w Anglii druga liga nie ma VAR-u?...Bo u nas,w biednej Polsce,stać nas na ten wynalazek-nawet na zapleczu ekstra(?)klasy...
Dan James just can't stop scoring can he? P.s. what a ball from firpo btw
💙🤍💛
It’s difficult to play and get a decent result against a team constantly fouling,,and the ref seemingly on their side,,but a bloody well deserved 3 points lads,,well happy with that👏👏👏
Back from game, hard fought win against a dirty team and a shocking ref, well done leeds MOT ALAW
The steward cerebrating with Dan and the fans. Passion.
Atmosphere was a bit flat today at Elland road so hopefully that’ll pick it up a bit for Saturday!
People criticise Firpo but he always gets down the left flank and being a left footer he gets crosses into the box. Byram or Spence, when we had him always cut in on their right foot which slowed play down and became predictable. Well done Leeds. 3 points needed with Southampton winning.
Preston played should stick to Rugby
PNE got their just desserts, play like they do an that’s all you deserve, it’s about time the Refs got tougher on them, they seem to get away with way too much
This one is for Jaidon and his family! Rest in peace, Donna ♥ Marching On Together 🔵🟡⚪
Vamosssss
Unbelievable Save From Illan Meisler The Iceman Sensational + Goal From Joel Piroe & Daniel James. Leeds United Winners Against Preston North End In The Elland Road Stadium Score By 2-1.
Gruev needs to be appreciated! Айде Илийкаа🇧🇬
Farke will have to find a way to select Giorginio, Bamford, Piroe. With the return of Struijk for me the ideal would be Meslier, Rodon, Ampadu, Struijk, Firpo, Gruev, Kamara, Piroe, Giorginio, Bamford, Summerville with James aged 12  GO LEEDS UNITED
That was never a penalty… But deservedly given after the previous 90 mins of absolute halfwittery from the Ref. Hope he’s sacked in the morning.
MOT  Greetings from Argentina
Love the shithousery showing the Preston players whining after the final whistle. Sometimes you get what you deserve.
This was a horrible game to watch. I don’t think we played well at all today but I think for the first time all season we played fairly poorly and still won which is a massive positive. MOT
This was a great win.. amazing resilience well done lads.. Let’s go… 💛💙💛
Leeds deserved the win. Should of been 3-1 before half time !!!! But all in all it's another 3 points keep winning lads mot Leeds Leeds Leeds 👍
How many thousands screamed noooo when Bamford picked the ball up.
A win is a win 💪 MOT
A guy called "David Webb" saves the game for Leeds he gave us a pénalty 😆
The ref was poor and lost control at times, Preston kicked us up in the air but we stood firm and I'm pleased for Piroe, he was ice cool when mattered, on to Wednesday MOT
Our hardest earned 3 points this season in my opinion, great team performance. In Farke we trust. mot⚽️🤍💙💛
James!
Preston and cov are nasty
Dirty team preston,so glad we won that made my weekend cheers lads MOT 💛🤍💙
Ledson getting in the refs face at the end. You cost them the game you shithouse, I suggest you watch the replay.
Cmon lads... More points to ensure promotion - not playoffs
The Ref made some bad decisions i thought...MOT
✌️🔥👍
Newell's Fan = Leeds Fan. Vamos Leeds!
Paddy, you always were a team player and had a good game, good man for making the right call. Also, you just have to say well done to the taffy mighty mouse 🙏🍻
🎶 we're whiney Leeds and proud of it, on 1 leg, like an ostrich🎶 2 straight reds, rodon, 2 minutes ish, blatant, last man, kamara flying kick
Well done James getting man of the match from sky sports,workhorse.😊
Leeds  blocked my post, for singing dirty Leeds song, and pointing out rodon could've had straight red after 2 minutes, and another straight red for Kung Fu kamara
Hughes should have been sent off after that second foul,thug.
See that everyone else agrees they were dirty as hell, no wonder their manager had that herpes shit on his lip,don't trust the same bottle as that man , then came out with that absolute dross after the game, hope they still fine him tbh for talking absolute crap 😂
Handed the victory in overtime by the ref - big teams commercial advantages...complete joke.
Somebody needs to tell Preston this is football not rugby. Classic dirty tactics from a poor quality team.
Well we knew it was not going to be easy and it wasn't....good win luck was on our side abit..well played lads..mot.
Thanks for sharing, shared.
Might as well put leeds rhinos on pitch with Preston, they tackled like a rugby team
Bloody needed that today, keeps the pressure on,,, 🇬🇧🇮🇱🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿MOT
Good win against a bad side on the day. They got their goal and sat in, chose to play dirty and disruptive at every chance to get a draw.   Maybe if Preston actually attempted to play football they might have got something from that today as when they did play they looked half decent. Half the game resembled a rugby match and ref was poor not to get a grip of it.
Onwards and upwards lads , let's go and see Delia for another  win.
Good work lads..... don't need a heart attack though 😂
How can that player have a go at the Ref at the end??? He stuck his arm out to stop the ball. Does he this those tens of cameras didnt see it? What a first class plonker but the right result for Leeds v PNE RUFC.
Ref was blind
Dirty fouls DIRTY NASTY PRESTON
Preston player who handled the ball for the penalty crying to the ref at the end what a muppet,go back home now preston you've had your cup final 🤣🤣
A deserved victory, against a bunch of  complaining cloggers
Another match ruined by a poor ref foul after foul and nothing every time leeds touched the ball this cannot go on.
Why argue about the penalty at the end ffs, it clearly hit your hand ryan ledson so it's a penalty you cheat. Preston got what they deserved.
I still don’t know why the Preston players were whining on about that penalty. It wasn’t a foul by Rodon and it was a very clear handball. Lowe said VAR wouldn’t give it. He’s in cloud cuckoo land if he thinks that 😂
Big points 💛💙🤍
Good win but we wernt good today
Preston are a dirty pub team that us3 scumbag tactics that reflect their manager...they are going nowhere.
A bit of momentum 🎉 Keep it going, (Motherwell Whites) 💪
Anybody else get the cold sweats when bamford had the ball in his hands? Great result.
I was screaming when I saw Bamford taking the ball... luckily Piroe took and score this. Farke really instilled order and discipline! Well done lads!
Well done. Vital win.
Great match with good old football tactics, and the mighty Leeds came out on top. Loved it!
Massive win 💪 MOT
Well done lads ,it's the result that matters
You can see why they worked so hard to get Meslier sent off at their place.   The reaction of Ledson at the end of the game arguing with the ref claiming his arms were by his sides was an embarrassment.   Forty fouls and eleven yellow cards over the two games shows what tactics Preston decided to employ to beat us.  With a stronger ref in both games Preston would have been lucky to have a full side out at full time in both games.
A late win for Leeds I am very happy for another 3 points ❤❤❤
Leeds are definitely getting promoted to the premier league. A good return I predict
Dirty Preston tried their best 😂
02:02 James hugging the steward during the celebration was wholesome AF.
Enjoy your day out Mr Risdale?
Haha #18 arguing with the ref at the end saying his hands were right by his side. That was one of the most blatant handballs I’ve seen 😂
Handball even in the box?
Happy with the precious points. Missing to much chances specially Rutter.Sincerlly I don't understand his  £33m that Leeds paid for him wasted money. Subs to late in the last 15 mins but happy with the points.
Leeds 2-1 Cheating, horrible, time-wasting, rugby side PNE
Leeds earned 3 important points hard and deservedly. Congratulations!
C mon Leeds 💪💪
Shout out to Junior Firpo, thought he had a cracking game
The ref should never be allowed to referee a match again what a plonker.
Siiiiii / Yesssss vamos Leeds❤ otro triunfo importante 💪 saludos desde Argentina
Preston are dirty af, and that ref is a scumbag for letting get away with it nearly all game, he was giving leeds players yellows for fun totally corrupt refs needs to be held accountable
Thought ref did well in the first half, didn't let them get away with all those fouls without a few bookings, but he COMPLETELY lost control in the second half. PNE not interested in playing football at all, and were clearly just going to keep fouling, time wasting and starting scraps, at which point the ref completely bottled it
Should've beaten them on Boxing day. This was a let off. I thought it's 1 point but Piroe made it 3. Really hard work against a mid table team.
It was a must win game and the lads did fantastic against a miserable dirty average side......I will be honest though when bamford had the ball in his hands I was worried. Piroe slotted brilliantly great win......now bring on Norwich Wednesday. MOT
great win piroe kept cool on pen did not try to blast it.
Top win
piroe big game player 💛💙
WOOOO 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Lovely stuff 👌
Oh my God Leeds don't deserve Dan James
Hard fought well deserved victory ✌️ the ref a joke apart from rewarding Leeds a penalty the ice man step's Up and Scores a lot of pressure for joel Piroe to take the pen got the ball off Patrick but if he's on the Park 🏞️ Joel Piroe is the No 1 to take the spot kick 🙏😍🙌🤩. Preston a bunch of thugs honestly if that was us tackling like that the Ref Dick Turpin would of sent half our team off . Only thing he got correct was the pen FFS. The whole team played as ONE 🙌 and for each other brilliant 👏 Lads. The last thing to say so much respect for Jaidon to be at Leeds United today after hearing about the sudden passing of his Mum what a shock. I have just heard Daniel Farke speak on Radio 📻 Leeds and they have dedicated the Win today for Jaidons mum both teams wore black arm bands as a mark of respect 🙏. Thinking of you at this sad time Jaidon R.I.P to your beloved mum prayers 🤲 and condolences to you your family at this sad time 🤲love and respect from all of us LEEDS UNITED fan's 🦚🇮🇨🤍💛💙
The win today was only a band aid over the same issues we have, again too pedestrian, sideways and backwards passing.. predictable as well.. teams are able to move across with 2 banks of 5.. no movement off the ball at most times.. we only won because they had a brain fart in defence to gift us a penalty.. once forward no overlapping, Rutter is missing too many chance's and, not popular I know but S/ville is too greedy.. saying all that a win is a win...MOT.
Vital win against a dirty side, class
Woke wife and dogs up celebrating that winner. Worth it 👍🏻
💙💛💙💛
Karma is something isn’t it
Elephant sized Conkers Mr Piroe, Well done Lad! WAFLL
Good lads
This is why Piroe needs to start over Bamford. He's a clinical finisher whereas Bamford is not.
Some of those Preston fouls. XD
Could be a big moment in the season that! Proper punched that air today thanks lads made me weekend
We were rubbish today. Not good enough if we want automatic
Well done lads - maybe Preston try and play more football and not indulge in the dark arts. Didn't work this time - lets beat Norwich now.
MOT 💛💙
