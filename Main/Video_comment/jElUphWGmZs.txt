Day and night, it still beats in my mind, both the series and the soundtrack were so catchy.,eager to see more random bullshit go ,Steven ,Marc and Jake in the MCU.
They say that he's hes Marvel's Batman I ponder
I'd rather watch Ben Affleck as Daredevil.  Yes, I am that unimpressed with this show.
Kids are waiting for marvel movies 😂😂 Men & legends are waiting for pan inda movies 🔥🔥
Welcome to the new world of the mcu moon knight
agents of shield back to mcu 36
Maybe there be a new uniform for Moon Knight
MCU's Marvel Studios Moon Knight Television series is gonna be the Best & Greatest Television series that no one has ever done on the small screen. Not even DC comics can easily pull this off. I'm proud of Marvel as well as being a Marvel superfan for Moon Knight deserving a recognizable moments.
MCU's Marvel Studios Moon Knight Television series is nearing the "Now Streaming" sign and I really cannot wait to watch this. I really loved and liked psychological horror-creepy vibes or feels like you know when you are gonna get scared.
In 1 day left, you're about to see MCU's Marvel Studios Moon Knight because he might scare you when you seeing him went after you.
This is the live action yu-gi-oh! I always wished for.
“What are you!” *an idiot sandwich*
"We protect the vulnerable at night and deliver justice to those harming the innocent person/s lives". That's another iconic script line made by me.
bro is that Whyguy?
🔥🌙
on disney+  aka imma pirate it
hope they don't woke it up.
"This is the best/worst day of my life!" Love that line!
Malayalam ❤️🔥
:D
I am Vengeance! I am the Knight! I am Moon Knight!!?? ))what
This like a new Disney+ series of ms marvel full season 1 2022 07 01.
I think rc world love to see this
ive been waiting for this for decades i ahd a bunch of moon knight comics in the early 90's just so freaakkin awesomes one i remembered the most was one where he and the moon knight spirit seperated and with doctor strange were fighting off cheops and cobra men in egypt the spirit of apophis was in moon knight and the cobra men were trying to vanquish apophis til doctor strange came in and attacked them helping moon knight its been many many eyars since i alst read that one
Thor love and thunder????????????
Voces en tu cabeza😎😃😑
I wonder if Dracula Will finally give Moon knight his money
too many spoilers in this trailer
The range shown by the actor in just this one character is amazing.
Marval got its own batman now
RANDOM BULLSHIT GO!
This is legit the marvel version of batman because dark knight and moon knight
Excited over the top!!!  Looking forward to watch it soon
Disney got killing too

To*
At*
If i had it I'd go crazy a first but then later I'd get use ro it

DOGE GF TO THE MOON!

TRASH MOVIE.
Guatemala 🇬🇹 Let go
''only on Disney +''   LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
meh. :)
Woah! Cant wait for this new Mortal Kombat series!
Son of b**ch, I only have HBO MAX and Netflix.
This is gonna be so awesome!! Same kinda vibe as deadpool? Can't wait for me and my family to watch it.
Only 6 episodes? That's why I'm cancelling my subscription. Been waiting for this series solely.
white dead pool
Duplicate batman😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Moonknight bgm 😍
Why do people want to watch a show about a possessed man? Marvel has an agenda...Scarlet Witch (Wanda -Witch), Dr. Strange(Male Witch/Occult), Morbius (vampire) etc. No more are the days of just being bitten by a spider or experimenting in a lab this is purposeful.
Realy... They copied Noob Saibot? 🤣🤣🤣
He look ghost from antman
?
just make it a movie ffs
I love they gave moon knight shadow eye's
Hello, I'm from Ukraine the city of Sumy. I don’t know who to write to the war has begun. No job pregnant girl. Very difficult financial situation. please help who can.
I remember back when I played Ultimate Alliance I used to play as him, I always told myself “I’d love to see a movie of him someday” although it isn’t a movie (but eventually will be in one for sure) this show looks phenomenal and a dream  come true
He is like Batman/ragman and the Punisher all wrapped up in one
Judging by all the bots and fake comments this is going to be another bait and switch dumpster fire
I want the amazing Spider-Man 3 please marvel
It's more like the Hollywood version of kaalo the desert witch
Knowing Marvel and the subtle shots they take at DC, I have a strong feeling that this Moonight will make us Batman fans, reconsider how a cape crusader should be on tv. I'm so looking forward to seeing the Marvel version of Batman, it's going to be badass!!
Copy of batman🤦🏽‍♂️
Marvel made a batman, hope its better.
So how did he make his costume?
The neckbeards and incels already hate this, because they lack the necessary thinking skills to realise that the main character doesn't actually realise he's Marc Spector or Moon Knight in the beginning, so, yeah, he's gonna be scared shitless by all the weird stuff going on around him at first.. It's like Thomas Anderson/Neo at the beginning of The Matrix...
It is in 3,1 nights week of new Disney+ series , marvel studios moon Knight full s1 2022 03 30 31 04 01. Is about Oscar Isaac!! Was on Netflix movie x men apocalypse 2018 and triple Fornier 2020 /- the Bourne legacy , the promise,, dune / star wars the last Jedi, the rise of Skywalker 2019 Disney+.
Not set in the MCU apparently, which could be a good thing.
Imagine if Sam raimi helped make this we need a soundtrack for moon knight, we need Danny elfman
Was all for watching this until the director became the world's biggest crybaby about the depictions of Egypt I'm regards to WW1984 and Black Adam, like does he not even realise how stupid he sounds when he hasn't exactly made an "accurate" depiction of countless things in Moon Knight?  Gets his 5 minutes of fame through Marvel with this series an does nothing but criticises others work, as a massive Marvel fan that's seen everything brought to screen, I genuinely hope this series tanks bad because the director sounds like a spoilt brat because others don't make things based on his personal visions an think the things that provide people entertainment should be political statements 🙄
Is it just me, or does anyone else notice that moonknight sort of looks like ermac?
0:20 i think i know this Scene
So this is like Shazam but Batman.
Jacked.  This is an understatement.
Wasnt this the series were the dude who was gonna be knightmoon died? they replaced him?
I like he's like "are you living inside of me? "Uh, no, It's a little more complicated than that." So relatable.
Sorry, just a "not comic reader" but is he like Osborn who has some kind of schizophrenia or something?
tbh forgot it was a show and not a movie
Cuevana en ti confio
He made a choice with that accent...
Batman greater than him
Is this copy of batman
Too many trailers feel like I watched the series already lol
0:22 That looks a lot like Werewolf by Night. The chance is that he’ll be introduced here and be there for his Halloween special.
finally marvel has a batman who travels the globe and is not stuck in one city.
R.I.P. Gaspard Ulliel
Moon Knight belongs in the DC Universe .  DC should trade someone for him. HawkMan for Moon knight..HawkMan is a better fit for Marvel. I know there's falcon already but it could still work 🤷🏿‍♂️
I hate to say it, but the CGI looks god awful
This is ground breaking for all the forgotten mummys out there that can finally see themselves represented on screen for the first time ever thanks to shitsny+ take a bow as Mickey mouse sacrifices another virgin to his overload of evil
So this actor dude is Apocalypse and Moon Knight. Interesting.
Sorry but this looks horrible, why?
Looks more accurate than better than that Ms. marvel show.
0:14 How Luciferian is this :)
0:04 this sounds like Carlos Bernard lol
Moon muss mit  universum avengers spielen
I love how spoopy it looks! Who wants me to make a cinematic moon knight twist movie after this show?
Fair&Lovely Batman😛
Is that poe
Strong wahmen's leads beta btch Manzel in distress.
A white Batman. I’ll pass.
Considering marvel has not put out a marvel series without it winding up being disastrously bad, I have a hunch people are not gonna like this once they see the actual show. Remember everyone, this is Disney+ after all
This really does look like marvels version of Batman lol.
So excited to not watch this!
Wish this was actually going to be about Moon Knight but I guess that’s a Choice disney made.
Algorithm.
Oh look a batman reject XD
Ah yes "RANDOM BULLSHIT GO" super hero
She should be allowed to become a Super hero!!
Is he batman but in a white suit
Oscar Isaac is such a great cast!
Will a hero one day focus their efforts on fiscal justice ? Tax evasion is an evil worth fighting.
Would be cool to see him interact with Deadpool
i wish they put the random bullshit meme
Pay Streaming to watch 1 episode per week. Nobody deserve
classic skybeam
Sooo it’s Batman……. But Egyptian.
As someone who read Moon Knight for a number of years across a couple of runs.  This is not Moon Knight. Usual Disney bait and switch.
Marvel just can't stop being awesome. Batman sucks especially compared to this awesome show
I have a feeling it’s not going to be as “Dark” as everyone was making it out to be…
That Werewolf by Night special they're doing around October better be a MK tie-in if we're only getting 6 episodes.
The chaos is close🌙
Ek week me kam se kam 2 episode to do
I’m so tired of this 6 episodes format. It’s just not enough. Marvel surely knows how to make movies, but I can’t say the same about shows. Just copy Netflix and what they did with daredevil.
Can't wait to see him crossover with blade.
Broken-sexual with a broken psyche trying to break the brawn of law breakers as he breaks the law by playing the law... From Batman to buttman...
Random bullshit go!!
Marvel, why did u reveal it's a werewolf?
Manifesting the "random bullshit go" line to be adapted to the series
This looks insane and Good
Cheap batman
amazing
It's a copy of Batman!
Bait and switch incoming
VENGEANCE!!!!!!!!
MOON KNIGHT VS The rabbit pattinson
Jelek banget kostum superhero ini
When your taking so many antidepressants, til you suddenly say... *screw it!*
Song choice is sick
Let's hope Moon Knight series has a post credit scene.
I’ve always been a fan of Moonknight… I’m not a fan of this storyline…. WTF 🤬
I really cannot get over how super over-the-top mind-blowing the cape turning into a moon-shaped.
Marvel's Moon Knight is gonna be more of hell of a fun and exciting wild ride to Marvel superfans around the globe because they're giving them something newer to their eyes. I really loved and liked what he said, "we protect the vulnerable And deliver justice."
Not gonna lie he kinda be like marvels Batman
It looks like the action sequences are goona be dope🔥🔥🙆‍♂️
Batman😍😍😍
Yayy CGI
Omg its batm… wait ?
The CGI looks terrible.
Me animo a verla
I think Marvel has finally got a Winner here.
marvel: this is going to break stigma for a mental illness we historically suck at portraying and shouldnt portray moon knight: mirror reflection trope 😬😬
This will not be good
only on Disney +... and pirate bay*
wait...its only 6 episodes long? wtf man
Goon Knight
I see this and I get excited but then I realize it begins at the end of the marking period.
I'm getting old waiting for new season of daredevil
I love return of the mummy!
Spawn Noob Saibot hybrid....
This looks like a homerun…I reall hope it is. Always loved the deepness of this character.
looks nothing like the moonknight i read about
Ok confirmed this is marvels batman
So does he moon everyone ?
Marc Spector is white. If Disney became so europhobic to the point of even making MJ halfie, at least make him Egyptian.
He is looking more like a mediocre mortal kombat DLC character rather than a marvel superhero.
Thank God they got his design right, couldn't imagine I'd be the least interested if they went down the taskmaster road again 🙁
Batman looks great!!
Please do not cross 1.83 million views upto 10pm.I invested 200 rupees in this
RANDOM BULLSHIT GO!
I hope this isn't as trash as the other Disney+ mcu shows
So basically the white Batman
I lost it when I saw the cape.
Marvel batman
March 30th is literally my birthday
*S a y a   a s l i n y a   3   o r a n g . . .*
This looks freakin amazing! Never realized how sick moon knight actually looks
Should’ve released this week, I got nothing to watch rn 😤
Man I wonder what type of creatures will be in this…… looks amazing 🤩
batman: i am the knight  moon knight: i am the moon
We're almost out of time for all the people who didn't care about Moon Knight before to hop on our friendly neighborhood band wagon. We will be departing on March 30, 2021 3am SHARP! 😂😂😂
Please Spider-Man movie launch Spiderman movie name Spider-Man vs venom
Trash actor tho
Why is there only six episodes? That’s a really disappointment
Cliche and cringe
I'm holding back on judgement.  It's a subjective call and I'll have to wait to see it.  If the character is as manic, in your face and out of control as portrayed in the trailers, I don't think it will last.  He can have mental issues, but he also has to have some sense of control for the audience to buy into it.  That's my thoughts on it, waiting for the actual show.
Who would win? Wolverine or Thanos?
Is that Werewolf by Night or its something else?
Zа РУСЬ - УСРУСЬ! Russia!
Can i just say I LOVE THE CAPE
UwU
I hope they use one of his most famous quotes "random bullshit go"
Random bullshit go!!
I was hoping for James McAvoy but nevertheless all the best👍👍👍
Moon Knight🌛, Moon Knight🌜, cant you see?
I still don’t know how I feel about this. I mean so marvel tv shows are 0 for 4 with me. And I’m not a fan of this multi personality thing with moon knight . The origin story was just fine and awesome. Why change it.
This is looking to be the beat MCU Marvel show yet.
What about thor 4 trailer  When are you going to release
"Random Bullshit Go!"
JUSTICE
I can't believe poe dameron 😍😍😍
White Batman 🤣
yerk
Full CGI
Not hyped. I m waiting for ms marvel.
this series gonna be epic!
I hope we see moon knight collecting his debt From Drakula, that big fking nerd
Looks like this show won't disappoint😌🔥❤️
Marvel be cool if you made a show for war machine
Moon-Knight is the Low Budget Batman of MCU.
every next trailer this looks more like a regular marvel movie, rather than the dark pseudo-horror/thriller the first trailer was trying to sell it off as.
Favorite series incoming
RDCWorld really made Marvel make a show
Totally sucks 💩💩💩
why does it look like deadpool
Hmm… this seems lighter than I expected
You have to make movies after this. HE ia very great character.
Thor 4! THOR 4! WHERE IS IT?
Reminds me of an old movie spawn which is a good thing lol
月光仮面！
only disney+ and dizibox
Great. Can't wait of this moon knight..
Cool
punisher is supposed to be making his comeback in season 2 of moon knight
4 in one marc steven  Jake  and moon knight
Omg warewolf  🙀
Anyone know who's going to show up in this series that will tie him into the Avengers ? (Not literally become an Avenger but one of the existing heroes in MCU )
Not sure about you guys, but I love the little horror aspect, and these series will be legendary for sure! Another thing, what a lovely accent! Bless, and let's go!
This character is possibly one of the most fascinating live-action characters Marvel has ever portrayed. The psychological thriller vibe is chilling, and I think Oscar Isaac is going to nail it👍🏼
I like the way they are going to do the multiple personality thing. Showing them that they interact.
This looks like its going to be good!
Oscar gonna rock this show really!
hyped for the series, but sick of this music
hmm looks like venom story
only 6 episodes? :(
Random bullsht go!!
It's the purple thing again!!!!
Naga ... Appo sherin dan Heroineah .. idhu ellam nanga 2000 la parthutom 🤣🤣🤣😂😂
I need 100k without video 😜 best luck my dream 😥
Walmart Batman lol
Ohhh yeahhhh!!!!!
best worst day indeed
i dunno getting tired with all these superheroes stuff the market is oversaturated now
So his other personality is learning about his own superhero career? Actually a very creative way to introduce us to the character and tell his backstory.
nightingale
looks childish.
Most hyped for a Marvel Show since Daredevil
The only marvel Disney+ show I will watch
I'm waiting❤
Moon 🌙knight is 100 times better than Ms. Marvel Trailer 😀 - Change my mind
"We are Justice" !!
the one thing i want them to do is not make moon knight a clear cut good guy and have him kinda go thru an arc
Looks better than Kamala fuckjng khan
costume looks good but the original costume with black feels more contrasting and better looking
He changed his accents from someone else
this is like black panther for bipolar people
0:21 YES!! They are going for his "doesn't feel pain" aspect and I LOVE IT!!!!
Batman but white
Bruh we only get 6 episodes?? I don’t care how long they are, I want more
If there is no "Random bushit go" I'm gona get dissapointed.
I actually can’t wait for this
joker ในร่าง batmanสีขาว😂
Have You Ever Heard Of The Brand New Series Final Space👽
Hopefully after Blade and Ghost Rider are rebooted, we can get a Midnight Sons movie with Dr Strange and maybe Man Thing if they ever bring him to the MCU.
Marvel never disappoints
When Fiege said this was gonna be the most violent one yet I was like sure but Moon Knight is literally impaled in this short so I’m thinking Fiege was correct
He was one of my favorites in Ultimate Alliance.. after Spider-Man of course
The wait
E
I can already tell that he's going to be on the list of my top favorite characters. So hyped for the series
HYPE
Enough of this...you already had convinced at the very first trailer.  Leave the rest for the actual premier
Pls don’t be bloody comedic pls be rlly violent and a 15
Hoping this series will have long episodes 🤞
I can not be satisfied with only 6 episodes 😫
I hate it when marvel starts relesing clips of their already hyped up shows and movies
“whou’ uh yuu? uh yu livin insiduh me?” -oscar isaac
HE'S TOO FUNNY FOR YOU, GIVE UP CORPOS
He reminds of the batman
the end credits at the end of the show is gonna be sooo good
I can't wait for this movie
O yes this is the best series ever gonna be bro ahh epic
cringe
Sasta batman
My new personality
Random bullshit go!!!
Was that werewolf by night???
Kay moonknight hindi mai bhi relise hoga
He can become a doctor but instead he became a cgi warrior. His father must be disappointed .
Many people can relate to their other half inside themselves . This series is gonna rock hard! 🏅👌
He sounded like jarvis
As a lifelong die-hard Moon Knight fan who has just about every issue he's ever been in.... I'm trying hard to stay positive, but the more I see the more nervous I get. I know this won't be a true adaptation of the comics, but I hope they grab at least some of the essence that makes Moon Knight who he is, and not a completely different character with just the same name, which seems to be the case. I'd love to see some of the supporting cast from the early comics.
Where my RDC fans at hahahaha!!!
I am very excited for it 😻
I just nutted..
we all just appreciate the content this man and his crew makes it's just a masterpiec imagine what's he's gonna be doing the future. 😍😁.....❤❤

DC Batman in white clothes 😭
Moon knight ❤️ is great super ✨🥳hero
I'm excited for all of this but seriously Cloak And Dagger straight getting shafted by Disney WHY IS CLOAK AND DAGGER NOT ON DISNEY + SHOW HAD 2 SEASONS AND WAS AMAZING WE EVEN HAVE A PARENTL SETTING NOW PLEASE MARVEL WAKE UP!!!‽
when you will release Thor 4 s. trailer
The fact that they still manage to have the song since it's first trailer is really relieving. Hyped for this series 💀✨🥵
Music is so good
MCU have Dr Strange, Ghost Rider and Hellstrom established, Blade and Morbius are coming soon, they're also making Moon Knight more supernatural in this series.  Anyone else think they might make the Midnight Sons movie soon?
I'm actually interested in this one because it looks like we don't have to know a 500 page essay word for word to understand a hint of dialogue
The Kashmir files
ahhh, him protecting people. getting a better feel for it now.. let's gooooooo
Give us thor love and thunder trailer waiting from 1 year .
the marvel Batman
I thought Moon Knight is a movie...
Thor love and thunder ka trailer kab aayega
Incredible
I can’t take seriously with that accent
I can’t wait for this, I feel like this will be one of the best marvel series. The only thing I don’t like and don’t know if many people like this, there are only 6 episodes but at least we have 6
Why did they copy batman ?
Is this character from the comics
Reality woman : are you living inside me? baby : *start cry  Alien man : are you living inside me? alien : groarrrr
The way his face changes from crazy to super serious is just amazing
iron man is coming back....... oh u will know i am right !
IM SO EXCITED
Was that a werewolf or Anubis attacking moonight
Deadpool + vision 😂
This Looks Incredibly Different From Any Other Marvel Movie Or Show In A Good Way Cant Wait!!!!!!
Наконец Бэтмен от Марвел
Moon Knight finally arrives next week!
I hope this show gets to be as violent as Daredevil.
I am Batman.
Some cgi looks like crap man :/
Looks like low budget Deadpool 😂
Moon knight & Morbius same day I guess.....
Eddie: We are moon knight 😂 DP: We are friends 😝
Lets goooo!!! Bloodless, Goreless Moon Knight Lets freaking gooo Retarded MCU
Perfection 😏
Only ten more days to go, I look forward to the premiere!
0:17 And hence forth we'll be called the Justice League 😂
so hyped, Oscar Isaac deserves all the attention rn!
*When Moon Knight is at its final episode:* "This is the best worst day of my life"
Too bad Chadwick boseman is dead else i'd have wanted black panther to meet him in the end saying he's making too much noise so they had to meet! Seems plausible to me atleast!
Batman from marvel 😁😁
the cgi needs more crisp but im still very excited to see this show
It'll be interesting to see where they go with the story in six episodes. I'm assuming these will be hour-long episodes? Or will they do what they did with Hawkeye and let each one get progressively longer as we go? Either way, I'm looking forward to this show. The end of March can't get here fast enough.
Can’t wait 🔥
Well Loki was the only Disney series I liked...hope moonknight beats it 🌚
Ayo the acting that shows he's literally lost it truly amazing 😂... Hyped for this 🔥
Pity how it’s not a part of the MCU.
Literally been counting the days
" This is the best worst day of my life "
Is it R rated
“OMG it’s Poe from Star Wars” You Are About To Destroy Child, Are You Sure?
This could top my favourite series LOKI
OMG THIS LOOKS SO COOL
😴
“The Lord is my shepherd; I have all that I need. He lets me rest in green meadows; he leads me beside peaceful streams. He renews my strength. He guides me along right paths, bringing honor to his name. Even when I walk through the darkest valley, I will not be afraid, for you are close beside me. Your rod and your staff protect and comfort me. You prepare a feast for me in the presence of my enemies. You honor me by anointing my head with oil. My cup overflows with blessings. Surely your goodness and unfailing love will pursue me all the days of my life, and I will live in the house of the Lord forever.” ‭‭Psalms‬ ‭23:1-6‬ ‭NLT
Wow... The moon knight fight for justice? That's new
What's more amazing other than the release of this show is how good the CGI is going to be.
Ethan Hawk looks like Kevin Bacon here
i wont him
Everyone loves the song but i find it so annoying. Hopefully its not in the actual show much.
One of the best thing about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieve sometime.he always respect us,the audience and his team and he is polite in all his video. We congratulate ourselves on this achievement more to come ❤...................

Fake spawn
Might as well release it already, so many teasers
I hope its better than hawk eye and winter soldier series
😂😂😂😂
Batman?
Thanks to whoever made this video. Actually, it looks better than the previous ones and shows slightly more healthy interactions between the alters. It is very nice to see the hero of my childhood shown in a way more appealing to modern eyes. Even if there are some inaccuracies, I just hope Moon Knight as a series and as a superhero gets more recognition.
🌜🦸🏻‍♀️🔥
That music
I’m confused and excited
HYPE LEVEL: OVER 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can it stream on 23 of march
I seriously can’t wait for the show! I still can’t believe moon knight is finally gonna get his time to shine on the big screen! Just bring in ghost rider and everyone else and I’ll be satisfied!
Only 6 episodes 😐
🔥🔥
ah so, vengeance but in white
I wonder how/if they'll connect this to the current MCU if they don't introduce him in MoM
White Batman
അമ്പിളിമാമൻ 🌙
0:07 Day n Nite 0:12 Midnight Me: every night at night
Wow great
Moon Knight is going to be fire 🔥🌙
"We protect the vulnerable and deliver justice." ❤️❤️❤️
Doesn't look like the original moon  knight  at all. Another failure from marvel studios.
Marvel's Batman is coming =D
Truly an amazing character hoping they show more of his scenes as moon knight in the series
I really really hope this is an Anubis and not THE werewolf by night 👀💧😅
SOOOOOOOOO EXCITED!!!!!!!!!!
The mask looks really bad. Marvel needs to move on from the CGI suits and make something practical so we can actually get a quality product. How do marvel properties 10+ years ago look better than what we’ve been getting today?
I just skeeted all over my draws watching this😩
Que buen trailer, me emociona como iron man en sus tiempos
6 episodes? Seriously? SMH 🤦🏾‍♂️...... Oh well. I will just wait until it's completed in 6 weeks, then I will watch it all whenever I feel like it, just so I can get it over with. If only it was longer.
Please yaar all clips mat dal9
So batman palet swapped having multiple personalities
GO RANDOM BS
and where is the Sun Knight or Star Night???😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂0 😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥
Wtf with the cgi
marvel ka batman🤣🤣🤣🤣
Moon Knight has been my favorite superhero of all time for years. When Kevin announced this show I flipped out… and the fact that it is finally here… I just can’t believe
His suit's bulletproof too, that's awesome.
can't wait :)
LET'S GO
If Stan lee were here,moon Knight Ms marvel will not be realeas oh lee😓😓
Please delete me marvel cause there is cpt marvep
What i know is imaging moonknight was in Avenger endgame War. Thanos must be whooped as by moonknight. Not only that i can't wait to see moonknight  together assemble with avengers. Gonna be lit🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.  Such a legendary movies.
Marvel about show people how to truly Batman. The realistic take is cool but comic accuracy and story telling is what makes the MCU what is today
Jeremy Slater, the head writer of this show is writing the upcoming Mortal Kombat sequel for New Line Cinema.
I saw the Werewolf by night (I assume)....
All the episodes gonna release at once ?
I'm very excited!!!
".. And deliver justice" sounds like Batman, oh ik, he is a variant of batman...
Oh My God. Must protect Steven
This is going to be a great show,,,,,,,,
อมกกกกกกกกกกกกกกกกกกก อยากดูมากกก กรี๊ดดดดดดดดดด
Bring on Blade
:O
White Batman?
Finally dark MCU character
Whichever one’s coming, I can tell you all right now, that this show going to be an immense roller coaster ride for all the marbles, senses, and sanities that we can EVER handle in an MCU Continuation!
While it may not happen I hope Dracula owes him money
He going to rock on disney plud
Looks dope
Damn..i just realized that it's a series..
Why aren't you releasing the trailer
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂قالك on Disney plus only😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You should've debuted this show tonight/tomorrow.  It's the Equinox.
While brice white by light.....
Does he throw random bullshit though?
I am still mad that the 'Random Bullshit go!' meme is not real
Нуб Сайбот, ты нас не обманешь
Justice, the answer is justice.
Jeez the suit is dopeee 🔥🔥🔥
Yo this show looks badass. I can't wait to see it. Oscar Isaac is gonna nail this role
"this is the best worst day of my life"....literally what I said b4 going to bed
Please, please, please be Dardevil-Tier. Don't over indulge in planetary stakes, or scene breaking attempts at comedy.
So venom but he is a white batman
ME: Still waiting for the Thor 4 trailer!
First the multiple personalities, and now jumping off rooftops with that skull mummy thing!! It is also pretty cool how the cape takes the shape of crescent moon!  Moon Knight looks very interesting looking forward to it!
Remember killing isn’t Justice
Yessssss
Awesome
"We protect the vulnerable and deliver vengeance" -moonknigth 2022
So wonderful
This is gonna be the best one yet, I'm so excited for this. Really glad it looks like they're doing Moon Knight justice
Prepare for 6 episodes which each contain at least one or all of the following.  Anti-white.  Anti-male.  Anti-Christian.  Anti-West.  Anti-Conservative.  Anti-Male.  Anti-Straight.  Standard Hollywierd procedures.
if they pull this off i think it has the potential to be my favourite show of all time
hopefully it wont have a lackluster last episode
I hope its rated r
0:22-0:23 i love that shot
I know it’s so good by the looks of things. They had me at Oscar Isaac, he’s an amazing actor and to get him in the MCU would be awesome 😎
6 episodes, what is this, a British show now? Lol
RANDOM BULLSHIT GO!
BRO HAHAHAHAHA THE WAY HIS REFLECTION STARES AT HIM AT 0:02 IS SENDING MEEEE
0:22-0:23 werewolf by night confirmed?
That song is getting old
This truly looks epic!
The sad thing is we won't see any scenes of stanlee in any series or movies😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
It’s like batman ini? But just different powers
I wonder if any of the comments on this video are real.
10 Days to go!
So excited
Unfortunately , Amazon , now owns MGM studios .......which means garbage James bond, movies not counting multiple other crap, such as the new" lord of the rings " tv filth . Good by to James bond , hello to AMAZON woke "bs" garbage 🗑️ .
Cannot absolutely wait for Moon Knight. Gonna be awesome
Abrace a sua loucura.🤪
This looks epic
Its more like Noob Sibot the theme hase to be noob sibot becomes
What’s up with 6 episode events ?? 8 sounds better 😌
Batman ripoff. Get original Disney.
First season should have 20 episodes 🔥
mmm Dena from Ramy looking mad fine
Moonknight
❤❤❤
Ohhh me vengo
The MCU going the supernatural road is going to be a hell of a ride. So hyped for Moon Knight
SUPER hyped for this BatMan film. God I love Marvel 😍
6 episodes only?!  man make 1000 episodes pls!
I am so excited
So he's like MCU's Batman
Gonna take some time to get used to steven being the main character instead of mark but this is gonna be the best marvel show yet
Why can’t they just do 13 ep series like with the Netflix ones
Good good see
Batman begins!!
If this character picks up in popularity. The cosplays at comic con gonna hit a lil different. 💀😳
Cannot wait to see Moon Knight said "Random Bullsht Go!" in his series HAHAHAHA
Being along time MoonKnight fan I can honesy say I never thought i would see this day I cant wait for this to premier
Demonios amigo, realmente espero ver algún día a Spider-man y a Moon Knight trabajar juntos en el cine
I cant wait for y'all to see how f**king awesome Moon Knight is.
Hell yes
holyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
I AM SO GODDAMN EXCITED
And torrent
That british accent is pretty bad lol
Khonshu is actually an ancient Elder God who predates the Earth and was merely incorporated into the mythologies of its mortal inhabitants after settling there at least one million years in the past. Freaking ELDER GODS are part of the MCU  wooow😩🙏🏾What a day
FINALLY!! There goes a Batman in MCU
WHAT IN THE ACTUAL HECK THIS LOOKS SO COOL
I cant beleive its actually happening, I remember a couple years back when videos were made of how moon knight was soo underrated and fans begging the mcu to give him his own series and more attention, now its actually happening Thank you Marvel ❤
Loved Moon Knight since my early teenage years when he joined West Coast Avengers, it's great to see some of the more left field characters getting a run out. Great Lakes Avengers, anyone?
Lol this looks rediculous.
Only six episodes? That's a bummer
who gives a f*** about batman. Moon Knight baby
I am so excited for this I am about to explode, guys I'm seriously
I seriously can not wait like this show is gonna go crazy
Hyped
FUCKIN 9 DAYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THIS IS THE BEST WORST THING OF MY LIFE!
He's like Batman. But with MPS.
0:22 Is that warewolf by night?
Drug addicted Batman is gonna be the best thing of this year.
So Moon Knight is sort of like Batman?
i honestly love seeing Oscar Isaac perform! He's gonna be an amazing Marc Spector
0:24 probably how I’d react to finding out I have powers too lmao
The more new footage I see, the better it looks and more excited I get!! I wish it was more than 6 episodes, but at least it IS Moon Knight. Can't wait to see what he'll be in after this show. The Moon Knight Rises!!!
Let's hope it delivers the batman sucked so bad let's hope this does it justice or at least something good for the sore eyes 😩😩😩
Marvel knows how to mix it up
Expect disappointment and you won't get disappointed
Cool!
I can't wait. and that suit is the best since Black Panther's in Civil War. a scene stealer.
6 episodes. Hopefully they’re 40 minutes eps.
Random bullshit GO!!!!
AYO I just saw moon knight throw random bullshit, it’s finally canon
Gonna be better than stupid batman
Why did you call me Mahk
Moon knight gonna be lit iinit
OMG this looks amazing!!!
Batman is done
We want the punisher back
I like how this seems to be implying that Steven Grant is one of the DID personas. Gives a nice in-universe accent for the TERRIBLE accent.
How many MCU fans here?
this series looks amazing, i reckon its gonna be the best out of all the disney plus ones
Cheap copy of batman but with powers
Moon Moon
Are they gonna bring him into the other movies eventually for like the next avengers films?
That looks ASESOME!
I saw a Demon thing!, there's gonna be monsters in this WOO!!!!.
Imagine Moon Knight in the Sailor Moon show.😂
Netflix 1 ; Disney plus 2   I think Disney plus is soon the Nr.1
He better get his money back from Dracular
🔥🔥🔥🔥
is this show weekly episodes or just all at once?
*How about after the viewer number come down for Marvel shows, Disney does a one-time run on ABC-TV? It would be nice if kids who don't have Disney+ and/or an Internet connection can enjoy that which Stan Lee wanted to bring to all kids.* 'nuff said.
Please make Mike Tyson a character of strongest of all avengers
cause day n nite
Lookin solid
Moon knight is basically marvels version of batman
They need to stop with this 6 episode bs
The problem with marvel is that, due to the way they try to setup these characters in an interwoven way, most of them have "superpowers" but aren't actually "super heroes". Like... wanda maximov doesn't do superheroing. Ant man doesn't really do any super heroing. Thor really doesn't do any superheroing. Like yeah they'll save the world because the villains are interwoven into their stories in such a way, but almost all of the mcu heroes don't like "fight crime" and stuff. Notable exceptions were of course spiderman and (on a galactic level) captain marvel. Its really really refreshing to see a real honest to goodness crime fighter
Awesome clip I am very excited Moon Knight Series 😍😍😍😍👍👍🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
wait... is that... A KID KUDI SONG IN THE BACKGROUND
CGI is terrible, but I'm still waiting
This make me crazy 😍
This will be the best thing Marvel has ever done, I THINK
I didn't know about this hero, but the look & stylization of the costume is 10/10!
I hope the violence is somewhat realistic. I know it's not R-rated so the brutality of actual combat won't be seen, but I hope they at least push the envelope.
I hope they make it wierd and dark like the comics
Besides daredevil, this will be the best marvel show as well coming in at 2.
In short. . .I can't wait damnit!!!!
Waiting 🌙🌙🌙
O
This is gonna be amazing
THESE FIGHT SCENES ARE GONNA GO SO HARD 🔥🌙
Batman who ....like I've waited for moon Knight live action since I was 8 years of age when my uncle showed me the comic and now that Robert pattinson disappointed me with his batman I need moon Knight in my life more than ever Oscar is gonna kill it way more intense than Bruce with the marvel humour I can't wait
I am just little disappointed that it’s only 6 episodes, Disney please make season 2 for all Marvel shows 12 episodes at least 🙏🏼
Just WOW !!
What if was excellent. Hopefully this can be as good.
Dc has Darkknight marvel has moon knight 😂
"There's Chaos In You, Embrace... The Chaos!"
I wasn't a fan after the trailer and the Super Bowl spot, but this is getting me a little more excited
I’m so hyped
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
My fav superhero since i was born is in live action😍. I'm dreaming.
It looks so good!
I love the way they use Day N’ Night for Moon Knight, the song definitely fits the mood for this character, 1 week to go!
The white knight strikes back!
Anyone tell me which can be Villain of this Moonknight Series??🤔
Christmas setting?
YES SO STOKED
0:23  That's having attitude!!!
ummm kinda looks like NOOB SAIBOT from MK11
Now watch while Marvel makes any cinematic iteration of Batman thus far look like amateur night.
its gonna be the best i am sure...!
idk bout everyone else but the more I see the less I like, pls commit to spooky or dont
I am Vengeance I am the night I am moon knight
With Disney buying marvel, we’re never gonna get a gritty realistic daredevil or punisher again
The thing about Moon Knight that I really hope they keep is that he is a FANTASTIC weapon but a HORRIBLE super hero who constantly worries or even freaks out the people around him.  There was a story in West Coast Avengers where he made this guy who was in a criminal organization based around Zodiac signs swear he would give up crime by swearing upon the moon. The guy, Taurus, went back on his word and for an entire issue we had Moon Knight scare the hell out of this guy by reminding him that he swore on the moon. Eventually the guy steals a plane and crashes it and dies, just because he was that afraid if what Moon Knight *might* do. Hell, in the beginning of the issue there's a character who in the 80s was the equivalent of Marvel's Batman (lives in the shadows, is ominous, detective by night, etc) and even he sees Moon Knight in this mood and tells the guy "Hey bud, good luck to ya. I'mma head out."
Oscar is going to kill this role!!!
I hope they don't miss up this show
Looks great, am I the only one who doesn't like the suit though? Hope it gets an upgrade at some point
"This is the best worst day of my life" loved how he said this.
Looks like a CGI fest :/. Would be nice to see some fights with a real suit
Can't wait
"SuperHero show/movie with blue/purple beam in sky"... love it
Let's gooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!
ONLY six episodes 🫤
looks boring
I’m a bit worried about the big laser shooting into the sky lol
Moon knight - batman, you got a friend in me
Moonknight trailer: Uoooo the mcu is killing it the best shape ever uoooo lets go feige! Ms Marvel trailer: the mcu is turning into a pile of wokeness its done and buried rip! Man, get your sh*** together
For Marvel fans, and those who are familiar with the character, probably are very excited by every Moon Knight trailer.  It really looks great.
A Marvel/Disney show that actually looks good, I'm shocked.
4 hours ago
I CANT WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Tengo altas espectativas con este personaje<3
"This is the Best worst day of my life " Wow
Let’s gooooooooo
I hope each episode we see a new personality of moon knight
Hyped
Been reading the hell out of these comics for the past months!!! I cannot wait!!! I hope we really see the chaotic reality that moon knight is in!!!
He’s about to retire 🦇Batman
I don’t understand why only 6 episodes on these shows
Favorite Marvel Superhero right here
Haha. The Batman at home.
I get more and more excited for this everyday
Every single clip they release just makes me more excited for this show
Why does he have an English accent?
the best part. all of this is inside his head. or is it.
They’re gonna disnify him when he’s supposed to be like a schizophrenic split personality, insane person.
It's always a treat to be a Marvel fan! I can already tell this is going to be a great show. 🌙🔥
Impresionante!!!
Better not be disappointing
So it’s only 6 episodes? 😐
wot r u? r u loik livin inside of me or somfing?
Batman of marvel.
I wish this series was like 12 episodes long. I'm already excited
Steven Grant??? Steven Grant Rogers???
Fun fact:Marvel got the MoonKnight reference from Daycare Attendant in Five Nights at Freddy's Security Breach.
0:16 RANDOM BULLSHIT  GO!
Is that a jackal!
Random bullshit man?
So we have a Batman in MCU
Venom, moon knight, morbius and hulk all of them have two person in one body
Mujhe 1000 like chahiya
WOOOW
This is why i love marvel they'll still not show any complete fighting scene but a teaser fighting scene just to make you hype😂, this might be one of my best series of 2022 because i love moon Knight from the comic and MCU moon Knight i pray they don't hold back with this character we need some real brutal in the MCU i can see blood on he's cloth and the action sequence will be dope i know because marvel never disappoint
Please release tomorrow. i cant wait long.
👍👏👏👏
Fire fire everywhere......marvel is the place where you see❤❤🔥🔥
The more I see, the more excited I get! This truly looks incredible but gutted it’s only a 6 Episode Series though! Wish these series were much longer
Moon Knight is basically unhinged batman. Banger character
I am very excited for this an ms marvel
My friend: So is this marvel’s Batman or something?  Me: 0:05
0:22 badass
Oscar Isaac in these clips is impressive. It's hard to think that this is the same guy as Duke Leto Atreides.
I love how his cape forms a crescent shape when he jumps down the roof. This show is gonna be awesome
Wish this could've been a movie
Why i think moonlight is same as dark knight with different concept.😂😂
MARVEL I'M SCREAMING RIGHT NOW!!!!!😩🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
im gonna have to stop watching these at some point before they start revealing too much, but GODDAMNIT im so hyped for the show.
The first trailer was a bad impression to me, since the extra editing made it look cringe-y, but after they released the elevator clip, I'm able to see all the tv spot in a way that truly excites me
Still can't belive how awesome Moonie looks in this, and the fact that his suit is more like a mummy (because Khonshu is the Egyptian God of the Moon, nice touch)
I want justice! I am Batman! Oh no, wait, I’m moon knight!!!!
الحمد لله على نعمه ايجي بست
Wtf, that's the werewolf
Waiting
DAY NIGHT 🥵🥵🥵🥵 🚬🐛
Only thing Marvel needs to work on; Either 6 1h episodes or at least 8 45m episodes
I Think About This show DAY N NITE
Leaning into the mummy angle for the costume was smart.
I'm so excited for this!
The cape making the moon shape I'm hyped!!!
Hype hyped sooo much hyped for this ..... 🔥💥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Triệu hồi phê phim , w2w ,tenticker
Anyone got anymore Kleenex mine has ran out from watching this TV Spot?  😅
Havent been keeping up with the most recent Marvel shows but I’m 100% coming back for this. Love Moon Knight
Hype💯
Again the world is in danger ⚡
This looks amazing 😍  Although gotta say, Americans doing British accents is always an absolute riot 😂
This is why I love being a moon knight fangirl.  Fans are just so happy to be getting anything moonie that it’s just all positive.  Only negative comments I ever see are from people that don’t know the character
and a one step link to Star Wars is going to help my 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon game a lot.
0:21  bro casually pulls out the stick he got impaled with. This show is about to be a masterpiece
This look expensive quality series
Do you think we’re gonna get some reference to “Random Bullshit go!”?
I can't not WAIT been reading Moon knight comics since 96' one of my all time favorite marvel characters....next all I need is a Midnight Sons series.....which rumor is they are building towards it
the only reason i subbed to disney+ tbh
Bruh it’s the white Batman lol
Batman better ……
6 episodes sucks
This looks amazing
Greatness 😁🔥🔥🔥🔥
This series will easily be one of the best for the mcu. Easily overshadowing whatever that mess they are calling Ms marvel is.
Looks really shitty ...
meteu essa?
I'm so excited with this since this is one of the fresh ones we know nothing about and they are now finally getting their shot
Ramy's Sister
much awaited series 🔥
Hope there's a Lego of this figure
Now I see who moon knight was fighting with in the end of 1st trailer
managing expectations cus the comedy looks like it’ll ruin it
I'm interested to see khonshu.😉
Noob Saibot
Dc: Please don’t copy from Batman  marvel: ✍️👨‍💻
Me who wanted a Thor Love And Thunder Teaser trailer: bruh are you serious  Me after getting a million Moon Knight Trailers: it is acceptable
So do we have the “radom bullshit go” in this movie or not ??
Looks like the magical version of batman aka the better version.
He starting to sound like vengeance
Start the hype train boys
I can't resist MCU's Batman 😂
I hope they don't hold back on the darker themes of Moon Knight
Proud to be Egyptian , can't wait to watch it 🔥🔥
My own personal bias helps but I know already this’ll be the best Disney+ show once it drops and a new fan favorite
I hope daredevil is in this show
Awesome!
We comic readers going crazy for this show 🗿
That lucifer type wing shield 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Maaannnnnn, I am really exited to watch Moonknight❤️❤️❤️
It looks like a character that is improvised on basis of batman  This has flashed to me when he says:we protect the vulnerable and deliver justice  Actually looking forward for  dc marvel union in future days.I hope it should happen soon😀
6 episodes only? Whats next by Disney, 4, 2?
This show is gonna be crazy. I can't wait!
And Spiderman????
👍
0:07 I still can't get over that hidden figure (bottom right of the screen)
Better than Captain Marvel!
Bro once I heard that Cudi, god damnit I think I'm aroused
0:21 что это
Only 6 episodes?!?!?! Wandavision and Falcon & TWS had 8! Hawkeye too.  Any way, i hope they do the character justice.
I'm so hyped
Lets hope it's better than the last few offerings from Mavel and please stop the manufactured comments. Everyone knows real people don't talk like that
This show looks fantastic
_I am a fan of Dark Night_ 💥🔥🖕
Ok, He is Hot... I get it
Ohh boy ohh boy, looks like MoonKnight is going to fight Anubis first 🤩🤩 Bring it on soon please 😌
Can’t wait. Actually I may just wait until the 5th episode 😂
i'm vengeance
Day`n`nite
Watch this 👇👇
boom fuckin boom
0:22 werewolves ?? 🤔
This is gonna be great.
Marvel has me so excited I’m ready to go into orbit without a spaceship!
Omg each new clip is making it seem better and better. I think this is going to be my favourite marvel series!
i don't like the fact that it's Poe's actor (Star Wars)
❤️❤️❤️❤️ sadless gaming ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Is moon knight a copy of bat man
Bgm🔥🔥🔥
I saw this character a few times in ONE VIDEO GAME called "Web of Shadows"...
Coming soon Marvel's Split
Awsome yaaar
0:23 🔥
This is a unique series indeed.
Its like goblin in spider man
Where is THOR 🥺🥺
Random Bullsh*t Makeup!  In the name of the moon, i will jack you for katamine
just gets better and better
Did anyone mention that Marc Spector looks like Tony Stark?
moon knight is finally getting the recognition he deserves, what an underrated character! Would love to see his role in phase 4-idk
I Cannot Fecking Wait For This To Come Out, WOOOOOOOO!!
His British accent could be on par with don Cheadle in oceans franchise
This one reminds me of Norman Osborn from Sam Raimies trilogy 😂
Please make this darker, there is too much bright lightning, and for once Marvel make a serious take on one of your heros, this is your chance, and Moon Knight is a vicious character, so please enough cute jokes and comedy bits with this one!  .. Yes we need a Marvel Batman!
So there is magic mummy’s dragons and aliens
This literally the what I asked for in a Batman movie.... Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. The Batman is good. Blah blah blah.  But he moves more like the [Dark/Moon] Knights I am familiar within comics.
i need blood and brutal and dark story not super hero all win that make me sleep
If Batman is Black AF1, Moon Knight is Black AF1 wearing Black AF1
When is the new moon 🌚  Moon 🌙 knight
He probably still thinks that Dracula is a big nerd who owes him money.
He has powers? I thought he didnt in the comics.
Looks awesome <3
Now we can see new Avengers 😚
💖
I can't wait I can't wait.. this series will be aladeen
Wtf is chasing him?
Day and night
whit batman dah 😌
I'm so hyped!
The BGM 🔥
Hope this up to the level of Peacemaker.
Batman im MCU
bri'ish people be like: WO' ARE YEW
This looks like it’s fire 🔥
Batman banne ki koshish
Hype
This is the best worst day of my life.👌 he got me.
This tv show just already need it a second season
When does it come out?
Why did they make Eterlames into a movie but not Moonknight is beyond me
I have a feeling this will be very watered down
I am getting Batman vibe from Marvel? This is going to be huge...
It's funny, someone actually thought to criticise Oscar Isaac's performance here.
hyped
POGGERS
Day and night 🌚
He’s bulletproof now? Since when?
Bruh I’m ready!!
This series is gonna be LEGENDARY!
This looks fantastic!
Ok.., that shot's pose is LAME!  0:16
There’s stuff that’s a bit scary but somehow I’m drawn to it!!😂😂
MCU Superhero/mystery/horror/thriller series coming on Disney Plus Moon Knight 🌑🌑🌑🌑🌕🌕🌕🌕🌙🌙🌙🌙🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
People who don't know Moon Knight: So is he like Batman?  Moon Knight fans: It's a little more complicated than that.
This Character Deserved R-rated Show But Disney😑
The only marvel show I'm not excited for is Ms. Marvel.
Moslim ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Me : Who are you? He: it's complicated!
Going to 1st horror style Disney+ show  and wil take marvel shows tp next level  and also give nice horror track to test in MOM
I NEED THIS SERIES NOW
It's gonna be epic
Marvel ka batman😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Epic Moment rn
The best worst day🤣 This guy is messed up in there
10 more days to go..
I hope they add the “random bullshit go”
this looks incredible, I love Moon knight comics since I was a kid.
Now they have to introduce Sentry so we can get Sunman 🌞 versus Moonman 🌝: Eclipse of Justice 🫥 written and directed by the Incredible Hulk.
I wish all episodes com in together
JUSTICE
Did I see a warewolf?
I thought the moonknight was supose to be Jhon Snow from the Eternals movies.
0:22 Werewolf by Night ??
I’m a huge fan of Werewolf by night. But if he’s truly that small they’re doing him dirty lol
Can't wait man
This will be good if they don't PG-ify it to hell to fit in line with the other DIsney + MCU shows...
0:22 Anubis Or Werewolf By Night ?
Is this an actual song
Oh i cant waiiiiiiit! :3
Looks peak
So marvel  moon knight  is going to be  Dark Sad Brutal
00:14 are those larping idiots back ?
Best worst day of my life. 👍
Looks good I would be happy if it wasn't 1 episode a week though I prefer the Netflix model watch as you want, some shows I forget what happened in the last episode.
La bu bildiğin bizdeki Akıncı 😂
music... i want it
It looks so cool...! The more I look the more hyped I became, can't wait for it!!!
Sasta batman
I'm glad Oscar Isaac is using his normal voice as Marc Spector because his British accent as Stephen makes me cringe every time I hear it 😬
Moon Knight is when the superhero Knight Knight and his pet Moon Moon combine via magic.
LAYLA!!
GOTDA,N
Moon Knight: 🌙 My mind: *Day n' Nite 🎵* Olavo de Carvalho: 💀
I’m literally shaking with excitement
I already like Steven 😆
I'm so excited for this series
His cape looks so freaking cool!
The overuse of CGI is disgusting, still excited tho
AMAZING !
what was that Creature that is fighting with Moon knight
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ayo there are werewolves too lesgoo
This will deliver the quality,I wanted from the mcu shows but unfortunately didnt get
When marvel makes Batman
Make a Disney+ show longer that’s longer than 8 episodes you cowards
POE
Stop copying DC🤬😡
"The Best Worst Day Of My Life" love it can't wait
2 episodes at a time would be nice…. Just saying 🤷🏽‍♂️
This looks dope. I really hope Disney doesn't Disneyfy it.
White batman is here 😍😁❤️
Yesterday was the best & worst day of my life 😩😩😩
çok segsi
Yo the cgi looks awful
I see the werewolf there👀 COUNT ME INN
the batman series looks good
Blade cameo?
JUSTICE
Moon Knight makes batboy look like a walmart "superhero"
Anyone know the name of the song in the Moon Knight trailers? I really wanna add it to my Spotify playlist
The crappy music, costume, writing and casting really is a waste of this great character. marvel has been going downhill ever since black panther.
กลิ่นอายเเนวๆ Alien vs predator เลยโคตรจ๊าบบบ
... this seems fun....
This is the best worst day of my life🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ogm wow
Kerala 💛🥺💔
If this does well as a series I’d love to see it turned into a movie 🎥
❤️
Best worst day of my life
Super excited 😍😍
0:12 looks straight ripped out fom the comics!
YYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yea I’m not digging his accent
I can tell beforehand 6 episode is too less for this character
Oh great, something else for them to ruin.
Woah!!
Oh my...god🤩
batman forever kids.
the batman was great
Goosebumps 😳🔥🔥 can't wait 🥺
Jaby koay already saw 2 episodes how ?
반달가면ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ아 응애에요~
Was interested until Disney's little Florida stunt, now no more Disney/Marvel for me. It's fine though since they only put out trash anymore.
Day And Night....
Marvel stays spoiling everything before it comes out
This is kinda scary and creepy...
I didn't watch the comics This explains alot
Where’s my money Dracula???
That Cape which made the moon symbol looks so cool man..I'm so hyped for this show
Where's Thor love and thunder trailer?
i hope its rly good
THANK u for the video.
Moon knight is like the dark knight of marvel
AYOOO WE GOT A SKY BEAM!!
huh?
It's reference from THE DARK KNIGHT
Moon Knight looks unreal! 🔥
Claim ur below 2 k commets ticket here
So bush man is not coming?
Crazy it's taken this long to see Moon Knight in Live Action!! I still remember the first time I ever saw the character was in the 2006 game Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
Moon knight is undoubtedly gonna be one of the best marvel shows so far, I'm also going so far to say that this is gonna be indeed the best MCU  Disney+ show so far!
I wonder if punisher and moon knight will meet.
For those who dont know, that werewolf is not andrew garfield. Its the werewolf by night from the comics.
Starts streaming on my birthday let's go hahaha
Are we only gonna get 1 episode on the 30th ? Cause if that'd the case I'll just wait till all episodes come out and I'll binge watch em
IN 10 DAYS!!!!!!!
So now this'll be our second character in the MCU that talks to their other self/themselves in the mirror, the first was the Green Goblin in NWH. Lol
i hope they make "random bullshit...GO" meme 😂
10 more day's 😫😫😫😫
His cape and costume is so aesthetically and visually pleasing. I think people will find him to be cooler than Batman!
random bullshit goo!!!!!!
Wow… str8 wow
Alright I'm hyped for this.
Thank Khonshu!!! We're SO close to the release!!!
Bro just release it already! I'm hyped afffff
Sorry but I'll be a lot biased coz I'm a batman fan and have recently watched the movie but I really think Marvel should stop putting in unnecessary humor and dependence on VFX that ruins the authenticity of the scene but this looks good looking forward to it but of course it can't generate the excitement or Adrenaline rush I got when I first saw the batman trailer
Sasta batman
What song it's so cooool
Seems like there's another episode of "where is the skybeam"
I just cant wait to seee..thiss looking  fantastic 😍😍
Whoa .....
NOPE!
Al fin no hay chistes
One Oscar Issac was enough to make this series at least good, but two?!
Reminds me of Spawn!!
Moon knight is gonna come out the day I finish midterms... NOW THAT IS LUCK
Hyped firely 🔥🔥🔥
I am so excited
Batman?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah yes
I'm excited for the series
I like the short episodes it's like a mini-movie.
Please be good. I grew up with all the comics of Moon Knight.  🙏
W
Gwyndolin pulled some major strings here
Too short.
Love you marvel ❣️❣️❣️
6 episodes better become 10 real quick
Can't wait!
Firee
This is the best worst day of my life 😂😂
Protect the vulnerable Deliver the justice Sounds like white Batman
If y'all don't picturize random bullshit go then I'm not watching
Warewolf by night looks sick
Just release the whole goddamn movie in YouTube.
Just gonna say 'BRING IT ON '🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
In 2010 I met this fantastic character (I state that I had been reading Marvel and DC comics for some time, but in that year I met Moonknight) 2010 was a very bad year for me .. But thanks to you I had a better life . .. Moonknight (he's in the top 3 of my favorite characters for many years now and I will never tire of this character, just like daredevil, he is my absolute favorite Marvel character.) Is a very similar character to Batman and azrael but at the same time very different. A mystical, cold and disturbing character at the same time. I remember reading a lot of comics about the knights of the moon that year and I liked them a lot. I can't wait to see this series, let's just hope it's ruthless and violent just like in the comic's.  Among other things, I have always found that moon knight reflected me a lot in certain aspects, In fact it was he who helped me in my darkest moments...  However I have noticed that The Moon Knight Movie Adaptation is similar to Ninja Turtle Costumes. That is, it is a mixture of the costume of the bataffleck, leonardo and raffaello from the films😂 (Many times in the comics he has blood on his hands, and he is also very violent, for these reasons he will be censored in the series unfortunately ...) (And then he at the beginning, in the comics, collaborates with an enemy, who will not be in the series, this already makes us understand a lot of things about the series ...) then he becomes "good" after they understand that he and the enemy have two different purposes collide and Moon Knight wins by killing him. But in the series probably none of this will happen .. (And My favorite character of marvel is:daredevil, moon knight, the punisher, (black) silver surfer, the cosmic ghost rider, anti venom and black panther.)  (But then he uses throwable half-moons and a stick in the comics. We probably won't see any of that in the show.)
Only one week more to go
i want the last episode 6 got Avengers cameo
This is the best worst day of my life
i love how marc and steven have different accents
Finally a better marvel content after loki
Are all the episodes coming out on the same day?
Gliding is same as batman 🦇🤔
Where’s his weapon? the staff?
😱 fans are going insane in excitement!
Moon Knight is undoubtedly gonna be one of the best Marvel shows so far, I'm also going so far to say that this is gonna be indeed the best MCU Disney+ show so far!
Marvel please Sentry New comes the sentry angle of everything and this comics involve one above all and divine creator and fulcrum and on form Beyonder and  Omniversl Angel race and Lucifer dark Angel and every Marvel comics characters this comics involve
0:22 Dope Af 🤷‍♂️❤️🔥

Only 9 days !
I love this moon night is cool I never read the comics but I just like to think of it as marvels bat man
0:22 wtf moon gid vs moonknight? Crazy bro. Can't wait for the episodes.
Walmart version of batman
It would be kind of crazy if the finale ended with him feeling "normal" like the series events that just happened were in a dream but they did really happen, just not as he remembers.
Moon knight- The Father Of Batman 🔥🔥
හද මාමා උඩි යතේ ❤️
I would love to see him with Deadpool
Imagine even more better VFX in the movie .
LETS GOOOOOOOOO 🌙🌙🌙
Is moonkinght 's cape is bullet proof🤔🤔
everyone gonna be hyped and then the hype will instantly die down after they watch the first episode. we have to wait 7 days for the next episode and then 7 days for the one after and 7 days after that and another 7 days after that and finally, 7 days for the finale
0:22 is Bat-man Villain From Dark Knight?
THEY MADE ENTITY 808 CANNON LETS GOO
Noob Saibot???
Moon knight costume design is amazing 🤩 it's looking good More then batman ☺️
Where's the Thor teaser trailer?
its gonna be awesome
He's kinda like Batman mixed with Spawn but way more powerful!
So basically Batman?
I can not wait!!
I’m sorry but the cgi eyes look really bad and I can’t get past them.
0:19 "Also you can't even imagine how much ketamine we consume"😂
Cheap batman copy
really excited out of excitment
Bruh released it already 😩😭
0:15 I thought I saw Moon Knight protecting Frodo Baggins 💀
I hope this is actually grueling
Moonknight is the best
Dammit that what are you such a bbad accent i hope that was the only one please lol
10 DAYSSSSSSSSS
Meanwhile in an alternate universe DC is killing it, and Marvel is on their 5th Ironman reboot lol.
This is gonna be great!
Brooooo!!!!!
Andrew Garfield cameo at 0:22
Thjs teaster hyped me up
Would have preferred Gambit
The CGI... 🤢
🇳🇵🖤
The crescent of his Cape as he jumps is sick af
Yup... Another MCU style action comedy.
Marvel's Batman
So no one is gonna speak on how they pushed it to the 30th......smmfh I can't wait that long....BRING IT OUT NOW! 😂😂😂
Thats how you truly deliver a series's trailer. Unlike some other COLOURFUL ones..
am i the only one whos excited for this but cant tell whats even going on
Costume is very nice😍
If he didn’t say “Random bullshit go!” I will riot.
I can already tell I’ll be obsessed with this show.
Is that monster werewolf by night (mark russel)?
MCU FAN OR DC FAN
we are waiting to watching moon knight movie...😊😊🧡...
Will they release all episodes together?  Or 1 episode per week ?
Mirip seperti ninja tapi asalnya dari Mesir,aneh yah?
I wish this was more than 6 episodes.
Idkkkk that scene where he protected her with the cape looked terrible, the CGI for the cloth did not mix well with the background, especially when the bullets hit the back. Looked like it needed to be smoothed out more
I m dc fan... Dnt know why I am liking this hell... This tune is my ringtone... And I am eager to watch this series first time in marvel
This looks trash. Hopefully I'm wrong
I saw the Werewolf by Night
0:22 Werewolf or Ancient Anubis Slave?
Kava en chak tawh ve....😂
I need to see him team up with spidey
The Marvel Batman is here 😍
240 hours need to go by quicker.
Hyped af
Please let this be good, I've waited years for Moon Knight in the MCU
Haven't been hyped up for something after LOKI (atleast not this much). Can't wait 💚🖤
OMG 😍🔥😲
Looks like he's going to use a british accent in one personality and not in another
Ddddduuuddeeee!!!!!
Why are all these Disney plus shows only 6-8 episodes
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.   May God Bless you all.
Omg the cgi is so bad😭😭
Batman at home is amazing
Man, that "accent" is terrible
Why six episode
*Waiting* 🤗❤️
Is Frenchie going to be there?  Will they show his husband?

Can we get Cloak and Dagger in the MCU now that Moon Knight is here
Ay they doing to much now stop with the trailers they are going to ruin the whole thing
a
welcome to the marvel universe ✨️
I got fricking GOOSEBUMPS!!  So HYPED.
Can't you release it before date..we r waiting 🙂
They'd better include Moon Knight's iconic "f*ck this bullsh*t" knife throwing meme
will be this series available in Hindi language
"Random bullshit go"
0:09 why did you call him Mark?
I fear for the sweeping changes they are making to the character 🤦
East or West this is the best 🤣😂🔥
this looks so amazing, so different, and so good. i hope this one is good
Only on Disney+? nah we're pirates..
Justice 🙄 wow so this is the batman people are talking about
Will you introduce Darwin (Armando Muñoz, member of the X-Men) into the MCU?
cant wait although subscriptions are going high ASF
marvel please stop making kid-friendly shitty stuff & show me some blood
Hype overload
Imagine Ronan vs Moonknight. Their suits are so epic
This is gonna be the best Marvel Studios show. It's almost here 🔥
Marvel's own BAT MAN.
This is gonna be good!
Every time marvel releases a new trailer of MoonKnight, I'm getting more excited
White Batman yay
This show is going to be epic can't wait.
Him: “Its like the best worst day of my life!”  Me: agreed…
Dam can u see hot toys making this figure
CAN'T WAIT THIS LOOKS SO AWESOME
I have a signed copy of the comic from the author, found it at a yard sale for $1
Marvel: let's make a different Batman! Disney: Yep, make it white and don't makeup black around his eyes.
Man this is going to be dope!
This show is going to push Moon Knight's popularity to a new level. Let's face it, folks, he deserves it. What a great character.
Fight club
Excitement at peak
Disney streaming is garbage.
I smell a bop. Perhaps the MCU's best series alongside WandaVision, Loki and Hawkeye.
Was THAT the werewolf by night
Black Widow teaser and trailer flashbacks
I love the way Marc happily says *"This is the best worst day of my life!"*
A Whopping 6 episodes......
We requested to release moon knight BGM  i hope you are responding positively
Marvel should stop   It too much videos every day
Hell yeah, I'm in😍
Got to see more of May’s character finally. 🇵🇸 ❤️ go May!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Then please release the whole movie in YouTube 🗿
I'm glad the costume deviate too far from the original design
I LOVE THISS
I gotta stop watching these, the hype man! Gonna be the longest 10 days ever
Mason dye is perfect for Hulkling.
> ms marvel
this is so sick !!! hyped up so much
This is the best worst day of my life.
👍👍👍
I wish cole Sprouse to be the young Billy Maximoff/Kaplan. This is a wish of many people. Plz marvel... make it happen.
About time for Moon Knight to ask Dracula about his goddamn money
thai finna be mid man. this has nothing on the batgoat. mcu fell of. ratio.
The best!
Mid
Oooh... that is cool. "Best worst day of my life"... what a line. I may use that myself next time. XD
🤩🔥
I miss the early 2000s were this was inverted. Comics were freat and the movies sucked. I miss that time for now normies like you thhinkt hey care about moon knight all of a sudden
You know what, I never read Moon Knight's comic book (well I just started to read some American comics dc and marvel last year, so I started to read some great arc first (eg, secret wars, coie, etc)  if there is a great story of the character, please comment!) And this trailer from the start made me so excited! Can't wait to watch it!
I was  dying for no reason that i know when he said *This is the best worst day in my life* 💀💀
Hoping for daredevil levels of badass
I wish this story  continues multiple seasons and not just 6 episodes. Cause I don't like this 20 minute x 6 episodes format. I want more character development and much depth and not just cartoon characters!
Is his costume fabric like mythic cuz Deadpool already proven that white costumes don't go well when you're about beating bad guys to a pulp.
He honestly reminds me of jedi temple guards
0:22 : ANUBIS!!!
Just wish they'd found an actor who was physically imposing. Moon Knight is not supposed to be 5'7".
Cheap version of Batman
MANOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HYPE SÓ ISSO
I really into these moon-shaped weapons, very cute.
To Everyone who sees this comment: Keep pushing in life and just never give up! You are a wonderful person, you can achieve everything you want, God may bless you.🥰🥰🥰
So happy moon knight finally getting the love he deserves.
Please Give us  Thor Love and thunder trailer🥺
i love how marvel's universe is expanding and how they all got plans for every hero there is. i'm grateful to be alive and to witness all this.
The mummification of his suit is absolutely amazing and an amazing detail seeing as how his powers come from an Egyptian god
I am so lucky that my exams are starting on 30 march😍😍😍😍
Let's get a bit more of a serious tone not make it all a comedy special
Whoaa🤯🤯
Excited AF.
I guess somehow palpatin returns

One of the best after iron man 🔥
It's cool that they're giving him the suited version as well but at the same time that feels a bit too soon for him.
This is the best worse day of my life😎
Bgm Gives goosebumps

*Another great piece of casting! Not one actor seemed off ! This.... my goodness! I can already tell the whole worlds gonna be hooked once the show starts releasing weekly!*
So his cape is bulletproof but not his body??
Ya aw yeter bütün heyecanı kaçtı dizinin. Çıksın artık, sürekli yeni bi klip paylaşıyolar, birazdaha klip paylaşırsalar diziyi izlemiş kadar olacaz
Moonman
How are you ☺️☺️
Starting to look like Batman Year One.
I like how Marc or Moon Knight says 'we' protect the vulnerable instead of 'I' protect the vulnerable, keeping the D.I.D aspect of the character
Hyped for this oscar issac split personality acting will be amazing . And exited to see moonknight God kaunshu 🔥🔥🔥
Absolute cinema
I can already Imagine supes reaction to this
🔥🔥🔥
Day N night .. I liked this methapor 👍
What if he’s 5 variants living in one body
Don't f this up Dizney.
i really like the character, esp david finchs reditions, but why does this show has to look so cheap  (but also clean),  whre is the gritiness ?
This video was so good that! One direction went to the other direction Taylor swift fell off her treadmill Alan walker stopped walking Twenty one pilots lost 1 pilots Chainsmoker stopped smoking England became Landless Panic at the disco stopped panicking Snoop dog stopped snooping
Its dark
0:23 "This is the best worst day in my life." I can see a meme material there!!😏😏
Meh. Too much CGI.
Noob Saibot
the best years for Marvel Studios. A lot of great series/movies coming! ❤

Osm😍
Right on time, getting TV installed in my room and just ready to watch moon knight. istg this is like the first show like i really deeply invested in. I read all the comics that moon knight fans suggested to read to understand this character, wait for the trailer,featurette and follow all updates about Moon Knight series on mcu reddit. CANT WAIT TO WATCH IT!!!
Marvel's Batman...
THIS GETS MUCH BETTER WITH EVERY TEASER WTF!!!
YES!
The BGM 😭❤️🎈🔥💥
This is going to be the best Disney+ Marvel show out there-The supernatural themes and plot, the epic costume design, and not to mention Oscar Isaac’s amazing portrayal of the character in recent trailer footage. So excited for this show!
Waiting for 30 March 🔥
i feel that this show will make a ton of people go like "wow having a personality disorder is cool"
Thor trailer
I am so exciting for this series release it first Disney 💝💝💝💝💝
I thought it's going to be a movie..😐
SASTA BATMAN 😂( my opinion)
Beatifuily
Esperando a série para assistir.
Jai Shri ram
[At some point in the future…]   Moon knight tv show: *every episode is released, you’ve seen them all, it does extremely well and the hype inevitably dies down*  MCU fans: This is the best, worst day of my life!
I'm really hyped for this show! but god dammit why only 6 episodes? :')
Esto será épico, papus
Can't wait to see the "Random Bullshit" attack
Next : Marvel moon knight uploaded

One of the most unique characters we've gotten from Marvel in a while. Everything from the tone, cinematography, and concept looks amazing. Love this step that the MCU is taking. Very excited to see this.
So did they just get rid of his third personality, Jake Lockley? The character needs all three.
Man. This keeps getting better and better.
Dr strange super
I'm so hyped
Not gonna lie, every seen I suit Moon Knight looks like some top tier VFX
Ohh I thought it was a movie in cinemas 🤧
Can it be the 30th already????
I am  waiting
0:22 what moon knight beating in  bathroom is anubis confirmed!!
We need the "RANDOM BULLSHIT" on the show
Is that warewolf
Welcome to the MCU Marc Spector
When garbage becomes the new norm.
Bhaukal...
Please be good.
Where  Is  Jake?
I might get Disney+ now & not use this spotty online website.🤔 Nahhh.😋
I am so hyped for 2022 marvel movies and tv shows.
Man i love series more than movies, better told story lasts longer and free to download

Just had a massive grin on my face through all of it
Let’s go

Hollywood aparchit

Arey bhenchod maza aa gya

JUSTICE

I love seeing all the beautiful arab people😵💫
This actually looks so good and I can't wait!

A sad excuse of Batman
It’s nice seeing a character I’m not fully familiar with be on screen since now I get to familiarize myself with them
i love marvel, we are marvel.. so excited
This looks incredibly good.... BUT I MISS THE 9 EPISODES LIKE WandaVision HAD! Bring 'em back, please
Falta poco je
I need to see this like NOW!!!. Right NOW!!!. This better go into a film after the six episodes run.
A la verga Batman
ten days to go
Yess love more Layla content
Gene harika ötesi birşey geliyor hadi bakalım...

Please  stop making pg 13 content..
오
The shot with Khonshu at 0:22 is **chef's kiss**
Moon Knight < Batman
Noiceee 💪🏻💯💯
So much potential but the 6 episodes are scary
Hi
Every time I see more, my excitement grows my boy Moon Knight is gonna dominate Marvel Phase 4!!
Oscar Isaac is gonna own this role! Can’t wait!
Batman?
If in 6 episodes, he is not going to say “Dracula owes me money” even once, I’ll sue them
lendario
0:22 WHAT IS THIS CREATURE ??! It looks like a Deviant in Eternals ! This series will be INCREDIBLE 🤩
Dang was hoping he wasn't cgi
It would be for very first time in my life. Moon Knight.
March 30th can't come sooner!!!
Only 6 episodes :O
All I want from this show is for Marvel to re-create the "Random bullshit go" meme
I'm going to be on top of the MUSIC INDUSTRY, I promise 😈🌎📈🚀
So early
Mientras más veo más me gusta 😍
Someone should smack in WB's head and say, "This is how you keep your DC Fans happy."
Wtf wtf man💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
WandaVision, Loki, Hawkeye, Falcon and next Ms. Marvel AND Moon knight? Hell yeah, I'm pumped
Vengeance
Oscar issac is gonna rock this show
No Way I saw this in the first 35mins Posted 😂😂
Man can’t wait!
White venom or something idk Highly excited to watch
Ok, I know he never actually canonically said it, but if they don't include the meme phrase "RANDOM BULLS#*T GO!" It's just not good...  "RANDOM BULLCRAP GO!" is also acceptable if Disney won't let them say it normally
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Finally A Fresh Storytelling
0:11 *I'm Vengeance, I'm the Knight, I'm BATMAN*
The suit looks soo good!
We want a Indian super hero 🥳🥳
LESS GO
This is so freaking badass!!! I really want to see this 😨😨😨
Batman, Eat your Heart Out.
Justice, the answer is justice🦇🌙
Vera level Vera level waiting  Marvel fan from Tamil Nadu 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🤔
JUSTICE and Batman goes hand in hand.
There is so spoilers
JUSTICE!
"This is the best worst day of my life"  😂
This is my best Wrost day of my life ⚠️😂
My mind always says moon knight 💥
I am Vengeance... I am the Knight... I am Batma... Oops wrong video
Dad He's Batman!!I've seen him on my TV!!
Великолепный лайк за качественные видео, как всегда увлекательно и интересно, спасибо 🙌
JUSTICE!!!
Six episodes doesn't seem like alot
holy smokes!!   OVER THE TOP!! ..wicked.  ~bye bye; Batman. **here comes the 🌙 moon-man!   OMG 😮~!!!  🙌⛩️🕉️☯️⚛️⛩️🙌.
"This is the best worst day in my life" 💯 exactly
Maybe it's couse I'm not familiar with the characters but this looks kinda silly to me, even by marvel standards. Everyone here seems excited though so will wait to watch before I say much else lol
This horror vibe makes this show more intense/intresting and just can't wait to watch it 😍
On my birthday moon and night 😍😍😍
day and night
Wish DC could have one oh wait Warner will just kill it.
Bloody hell
not even exited for this ...looks same like other marvel movies.. waiting for morbius to be honest
OMG! Is that the werewolf by the night?!
Why does he sound like Gordon Ramsay in the beginning? 😂
Very good
Still mediocre with that Disney formula and not embracing the heart material. Being too soft so general audience can turn off their brains and enjoy it. No artistic qualities. Most of it doesn't even look that good for a 2022 TV show with Disney's budget. I am still hyped but truth is truth. Disney ruined Marvel and Star Wars. They don't have good directors and writers who have passion or any interest in the heart material but this kinda looks promising, however highly limited ofc.
Batman
lucid dreamers gettin excited🌚🌚
If they can pull off Marc's dissociative personality disorder then they can definitely pull off The Sentry and The Void dynamic in the future.
Keren ini mah . . .
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm hyped for this. This could be the best MCU show ever. Also, when are they going to reveal Anton Mogart/Midnight Man because he's been confirmed for the show and we know is the actor.
Please release the theme song🙏
this feels like horror yet comedy at the same time.
This looks like the perfect suspense series, I’m really excited for this one 🙏🏽💜
First Marvel tv Imma watch since Wanda vision, hope it's good.
Woah waiting
I’ve recently read some 1 Star reviews on all the 2021 MCU stuff and I’ve heard many complaints about their plots, humor, character developments and Disney overall. But this series will definitely prove them wrong. The supposed Marvel Batman will definitely be a serious one with an actual mature feeling to it. In other words, this may not be kid friendly, but at least this will give the fans that have left after Endgame (or maybe even at some point in Phase 4) something dark, something mature, something filled with more action than jokes.
I'm looking forward to see what they do with this show. A psychological horror show is gonna be awesome and new for the MCU.
looks so overrated
dark moon light knight
The sad part is that you can’t use Disney+ in my country so I’m definitely not gonna be able to watch it :,)
Sasta garibo ka batman 😂😂
srsly, this series is going to be one of my favs, moon knight? I REALLY CANNOT WAIT!!!! the more clips they gave to us the more I got excited😭
Primero XD 👍
And violet if u seeing this 🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔
So excited!!!!
Hyped up
Talking to your alter egos should be made like William Defoe in Spider-Man. Oscar Isaac should talk as both personalities in a single shot. Waiting for this series. ❤️
I Respect Everyone who were involved in this , Seriously the best piece that I' ve ever seen on YouTube ,HATS OFF TO WELL ALL ! LOVE YOUR VIDEOS 😁😁😁😂😂..
I was excited until this trailer now I am really worried about the series

SHOOT ! THIS IS COOL!!
i'll be shock if moon night say, "i'm vengeance"
So hyped 😀
I saw Batman yesterday and I thought it was alright, so seeing this after seeing the dark knight would be a fresh sight seeing someone with a cape and acting serious.
I will watch this series because of his acting ❤️❤️❤️
Looks sooooo good!  I can't wait to watch _M  O 🌙 N K N I G H T!!!_
Moon knight is soooo cool!!!!
I'm hyped.
So cool
Where is Thor: Love And Thunder Trailer?
Moon will prevail
This looks soooo good, I am so hyped
I m not gonna watch this show       I m gonna binge watch after it ends 😅
Love him so much his acting is sooooooo good
Let's goooooo
It looks so good I just cannot wait for it, it better be in the TV-MA profiles which would make it so much more better seeing a more brutal side of the MCU
Marvel just trying so hard to be DC now, but they need to understand that they're character's no where near as great and serious like DC. But I maybe watch this BATMAN wannabe series.
Sure hope it isn't the same capeshit that the movies are
Woooaaa, why 10 days feels so long :/
your teasers really Teasing me
This looks DOPE! 🔥🔥🔥
he may kill the bad guys to seek for justice, unlike a certain hero who kills the bad guys by hospital bills
Hell yes
Excited for this Batman's variant in mcu 😂
Oscaaaaaaaar
Goose bumb literally
Hopefully he makes it into one of the mcu movies, or better yet, gets his own.
So basically Batman.
Why why why make Eternals a Movie  and not a Series. ... You Should've made a Moon knight Movie ... You'd made a ton of money and more people would see it
i love the batman 😍😍
0:22 oh that was new cool scene 👀🤎 werewolf💀
just ten days left
Está increíble
When the Thor love and thunder teaser get relese 🤔🤔🤔
respect marvel

Superhero movie. Whaat. :p
This is gonna be one of the best Disney plus series we'll see
6 episodes are not enough!😤😤😤
This series will be the one of the best series ever in marvel
So hyped
Hope they don’t do a lot of comedy…. Hawkeye was the worst series (after Hawkeye I really got scared of what they will do with wolverine and more mature characters)…. Please keep wolverine with deadpool 18+ movies…same for daredevil.
CAN'T WAIT 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Is available  in hindi ?
noice

Oscar Isaac was born to play moon knight one day👑🌙

❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥
Goose bumps!
Less than 2 week from now!!
Sooo hyped!!!!!!!!!
finally moon boys getting the love he DESERVES.
Hmm something strange just happened. For once I watched the trailer for a new serious and thought "do I really care? Is it worth a watch? More rehashing of same superhero story tropes and cgi" never in my life did I think I'd come to this. But I think I'm finally seeing all these shows as just reskinned cash grabs :(
Moon knight was always my favourite character of Marvel. Because even Taskmaster can't copy his fighting style
I died watching this
Black Knight: 😖 Dark Knight: 😐 Moon Knight: 🤩  😂😏
"This is the best worst day of my life!!!!!" OH CRAP I'M DEFINITELY IN LOVE NOW
Only 10 more days, but I can't wait. Plus there's only 1 episode per week.
Moon Knight, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Deadpool... all proof that the white eyes work on film. Can someone at Warner Bros pay attention to Marvel and give Batman some white eyes already!?!
*Marvel BATMAN*
Ahhhh!! I'm loosing control please release all episodes at a time not by weekend by weekend  day's. I can't say that's not matter you release is it this month or the next month cause I have to watch it like now!!
"This is the best worst day of my life" 😂😂😂
i really can't wait for this series to come out
Why don't they release some more footage like this so that we can get to see the whole film without it getting released?🙂
This really gives me Batman vibes
This is the best worst day of my life!!! (Legendary line lol XD)   But when it comes to legendary lines "With great power comes great responsibility" takes the lead in mg heart forever
Bro uh always come up. A incredible editing and awesome songs man appreciate it loveit
oscar isaac’s acting looks crazy
Pog Moon knight
Moon knight is gonna be more than just Batman rip off
So watching it wishes it was rated R. Feels like it could
So excited 🤩🤩
I SCREAM! 😱 That will be AMAZING 🔥
I wonder how they are going to cover so much in just 6 episodes, gonna be an absolute banger!
Omg just release it already 😫 I can't wait.........
Thiss iss going to be classic
0:04 - 0:05  uh someone correct me if I'm wrong, but people with DID (multiple personalities) can't talk to others in their system via reflections right? If this was a magical multiple souls in one body situation then fair enough, but it's known that Moon Knight has DID and Marvel has confirmed it when this show was first announced.

Who see werewolf
Moon Knight should really team up with The Batman.
In Loving Memory Of Gaspard Thomas Ulliel (11/25/1984-1/19/2022)

After Loki... This is the show that I'm most hyped for🔥🔥🙌
Is this gonna be 6 episode on single day?
Words cannot describe how excited I am to see this
i really wish they showed all the suit footage in the trailer
Wow looks great 🤘🏻 well done
So it was a jackal probably a representation of anubus
WOw this Batman ripoff seems promising.
12 minutes and 27K views already?! Wow. I mean, seriously, WOW!!!
*This character is possibly one of the most fascinating live-action characters Marvel has ever portrayed. The psychological thriller vibe is chilling, and I think Oscar Isaac is going to nail it.* 👍🏼
basically marvels batman, looks really good tho.
This is definitely gonna be the best MCU show. Can’t wait!
Where are you youtubers🤔🤔
I am batman
I cant wait to see this legendry production.
*The way the MCU is expanding and ushering in a new Saga is gonna be insane to witness firsthand. I'm almost impatiently waiting to see all the new characters come together.*
Moon night is defferent to all Avengers family 😁
So he's basically look like batman
I will need lots of ketamine to watch this show
*"Not choice, Responsibility!"*
Se ve chido. Xd

"This is the best worst day of my life", relatable on regular basis
MOON KNIGHT looks like the most unique addition to the MCU since Iron Man. Like IM, he’s to an unknown commodity to most, with potential of enthralling the world!

Hello
Looks Amazing.  I Love the part where he says this is the best and worst day of my life, while laughing and almost crying at the same time. Lmbo. Oscar Isaac is the Man. The show looks awesome on the trailers, can't wait to see the first episode.  Disney, I wouldn't get mad if you let me watch it early. Lol. I wouldn't tell. Lol
this is very nice and cool
😍😍😍😍😍
Loved the moon and the night! ...   Today
10 days to go. Lest's goo..
👋🏻💥  Guess the Character from this
Thor trailer? 😞
👏👏👏
I am in for the Best Worst Day of my Life !
Oohh my .... You are testing my patience 😍😍😍😍😍😚😚
How's 6 episodes gonna be enough?? We need more!!
Lover
Too bad they wiped the character from being Jewish. Such a let down. It's as if they were to remove Daredevil's Catholicism
This is the best worst day of my life.
Everywhere i go i see you . Waiting
These visual effects in this series look awesome and I just can't wait to finally see the series! Defiantly gonna be one of the best MCU series on dinsey + so far.
This series is ooozing with the potential to be something rememberable in the MCU!🙏👀
Is that Werewolf by night we saw
“We always have a choice! You had a choice when you killed my uncle!”
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oh My God, I can't wait anymore...

is moonknight a part of the current MCU? or is it based in some other alternate universe?
This looks amazing, I’m really excited for this series
I'm glad Marvel is leaning more into psychological thriller and horror! They might as well do that in Doctor Strange 2, their Werewolf By Night Halloween special, and their Blade movie!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Most anticipated superhero of 2022, The Moon Knight
I AM WAITING FOR THE SERIES
