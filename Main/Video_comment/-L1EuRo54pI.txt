I hope Resident Evil Requiem on PS4 too like this.
I'm very happy this Game on PS4
One of my favorite games ever.  Been playing since the beginning of the Super Nintendo days so I’m a bit of an oldie but this game is perfect in my opinion.  Loved the original back in GameCube as well but this remake feels polished.
3 years
take me back to this time
Remake was mediocre
Nice

The greatest remake
Thanks
No habrá ganado el Goty, pero si el corazón de todo el mundo.
Remakes de RE2 e RE4 ficaram tão bons como os originais, além de muito bonitos também, incluindo o RE3 Remake(pena que este e ruim kkkkk), mas outros dois estão sensacionais. RE7 também é muito bom.
Voltando aqui pra lembrar do trailer do State of play que foi inesquecível é inesperado, foi um Hype do caramba nesse jogo
This remake achieved the impossible .
This was a year ago. Now we got a seperate ways dlc. How time flies...
This is the Best remake of resident evil!
im back again here after chapter 16. for several month i was super excited for this and now after baby eagle get home. i had nothing else to do :(
I love this
don't mind me, just watching this thing once again.
I just want the full song that’s in the intro. 🥲 amazing game, it will always be in my top 3 games ever.
Just finished this masterpiece or a reentry.
Masterpiece 🔥
Leon looks so handsome 🔥
I come after I finished the full game, and all I have to say is that CAPCOM has made a masterpiece, In my opinion this Remake it's one of the best, comparing it with the three that have been developed, and I even think this one it's much better than the original made in 2005, and of course, the classic one will be always in my heart, but I truly believe  We needed this Remake,, Claps for CAPCOM.🎉❤
Game is actually a masterpiece
nice!
CAPCOM managed to capture lightning ⚡️ in a bottle once again. Perfection!
اهي نزلت ي رجاله ونزلت ع البلايستيشن ٤ كمان😂😂💕💕
Tomorrow it's so on baby!!!! Just got to get through tonight! 😆😆😁😁🥳🥳
12 hours remaining until release.. Its been a long wait but worth it!
What is the name of intro song?
Cool Welcome Home Leon RE4 Remake (2005-2023).
PSVR2!!!
Belleza el flamenco pero sin el feo Reguetón
Next Devil may cry 1 remake with re engine
Xbox one
for ps4 is there any
please dont butcher this one
The most beautiful game Lady Resident Evil 4 from childhood
My opinion is to drop the game earlier… cause a lot of people like me we working on summer season and this is gonna take 6 months to play it

Mortal Kombat 11 - State Of Play June 2022 Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games
Este juegazo en un VR - Realidad Virtual nos va a volar la cabeza a los que ya lo hemos jugado infinitas veces y los que no, a los que llegan de nuevo y será un vende-visores VR. El RESIDENT EVIL VII de PlayStation es una EXPERIENCIA que debes de sentir-vivir una vez en tu vida.🤯  Espero y deseo que ojala lo saquen para PC en VR también y casi acto seguido del lanzamiento, este tiene que y debe de ser el pistoletazo de salida para programadores y usuarios para que todos nos adentremos en este inexplorado y extraordinario mundo de la RV - Realidad Virtual de la mejor mano que uno de los mas grandes de todos los tiempos, haremos un exorcista cuando escuchemos: ¡ Detraas de ti ImbeSil !😄
I hope capcom dont cut any original content from original re4
they better bring the mercenaries game mode back
The water looks like jelly at 0:55... Sony and Capcom please gear up your PSVR2 powers. Make the water look like real water.
change his lius face because luis's face is like a pendeco
where is the laser sight????????????
This makes me wanna buy all the RE's for collection
Best game of all time. Although quite early for the remake i believe.  The original still plays just as great.
Old is gold ☺️❤️
I like how the remakes casually replaced the Revelations spin-offs between main entries in the series.
Im so exicted Capcom dont dissapoint us
tank you for  resident evil 4 rimek  I'm happy for  sony
❤❤❤
TOME CAPCOM, TOME MEUS DINHEIROS 👐💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸
Is there a ps4?
Also I'm hoping capcom doesn't mess this up like how they did it with the RE3 remake
Who wants to bet that even once the remake is released, Capcom will still port RE4 to PS5 and Xbox Series S/X anyway?
Can't wait for the RE4 remake to come out! It's my favorite game out of the franchise!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👍🏽
Hello Capcom, stop making a resident evil remake, resident evil 4 don't need a remake, is perfect when you make it, why you should do a resident evil Survivor remake in 3er person, or better a resident evil of Billy Cohen, Jill Valentine, make back to life a pierce nevans, so many characther And you making a remake! Is Jake weskers a live, Sherry, Leon, what happen with Neo unbrella, where is barry? Etc etc etc, but make all resident evil in 3 person pls!
I hope they can add in co-op multiplayer.. that would be amazing
Watching this PS Showcase Trailer was the best way to start Summer 2022 Ever
Unbelievable
Hi IAM VIGNESH . I LOVE THIS GAME VERY MUCH 😍😍😍😍😍😍 I CANT WAIT PLZ RELEASE THE GAME QUICKLY😭😭😭😭😭😭
THE announcement for pushing to back to previous gen was a big big turn OFF. Cant expect a true next gen RE Horror game for now. A big let down.
Seeing how badly Capcom fumbled RE3 remake, has me a bit skeptical.
Rosalia confirmed in the soundtrack at the beginning. We love to see it. 😘💅
Please keep the car music
Meu resident evil favorito Marcou uma geração.
Please i want Jill and rebecca come in resident evil 4 remek please 😰😰💙💙💙❄️❄️❄️☃️☃️❄️❄️🥺🥺❄️❄️🤲🏻❄️❄️☃️🌧🌧🌧❄️❄️☃️❄️❄️❄️💙💙🥺🥺🌧❄️

Beautiful Spanish music at the start, can’t wait for this game
The Fact that it's coming out on my birthday is just PRECIOUS!!!
バイオ歴26年初期世代の者です。 バイオハザードコードベロニカをリメイクして欲しい、一番人気の作品で歴としたストーリーがあるのにカプコン扱い方雑かつ残念！再びファンから大炎上並みの要求！4以降はリメイク要素ないです。
Hype
I hope this makes its way to the Switch. I remember getting a Gamecube at 9yrs old solely to play RE4.
I hope it comes to ps4
رزنت ايفل 4ريميك  👍

Looking forward to the "El Gigante" fights. I wonder what the Plagas will look like......

Resident evil 4 is kinda overrated I think they should remake Resident Evil code veronica before resident evil 4
They better add a trophy for shooting krouser's military hat off during his fight
Man ….. why not on ps4
Is this real 😳😳😳😳😳
Re2 remake my boi was so happy looking, now he’s just ☹️
PS4 please
The starting music gives me chills and goosebumps.Masterpiece music
I hope this Game on PlayStation 4
Can't tell enough how hyped I am for RE4 Remake looks the excellent what I've seen in the trailer I just hope Capcom retain a majority of what was the classic original, go on Capcom do us justice like you did with RE2 Remake, not long now.
No ps4? ;-;
Capcom know what they're doing bringing back these gems. One of my favorite RE games.
😱😱😱😱 RE4 🤩🤩🤩 puede por favor PS4 😭😭🙏 PS4 RE4 ME GUSTO 🤩🤩🤩 😎👍 POR FAVOR PS4
I REALLY HOPE THIS GAME WAS NOT SHORT AS RE 8
So excited for this!!!!! I can't wait to see the classic enemies and bosses in their new designs! I also hope we have the laser on our gun.
Is this only for ps5?
Is it gonna be on ps4
Regenerator and chainsaw, and of course leon help. It's very full of nostalgia
😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
People from Spain have Spaniard accent, not Mexican accent as the original Resident Evil 4
It will be on steam?
I am evil rassin wait all yours on May canel of YouTube
This is a big f u to Xbox
Notthe same voice actors?
1:28 are you telling me Bitorez may behave as Mr x in re2, like chasing and that? :DDDD
Viva España!
A lot of big games coming this year
Leon definitely didnt have that sloppy pants and jacket in the original. Maybe the devs needs to learn proper fashion and more fitted clothing that looks way better?
it looks like they might make Ashley less annoying, i never found her that annoying but i’m cool with that
I really hope we get a Leon S. Kennedy and Ada Wong skins in Fortnite from Resident Evil 2 remake and 4 remake and the Skins will have 3 edit styles Leon's edit styles will have RPD police uniform from Resident Evil 2 remake which will be his default look and his other two headed styles will be from Resident Evil 4 with his jacket and the other edit style will be no jacket and for Ada Wong her head styles will be her red dress from Resident Evil 2 remake their other edit style will also be from Resident Evil 2 remake which will be her trench coat and sunglasses look and her third edit style will be from Resident Evil 4 remake and Leon's Resident Evil 4 we make along with Ada Wong's Resident Evil 4 remake will be the only sneak peek that we will get of the game hopefully they will release these two skins if they ever do end up making more Resident Evil 2 remake and 4 remake skins to fortnite on the item shop for Halloween
Sound thai
Resident evil 0 next! Like to make it happen
Bem legal top jogos futuro verdade trabalho saber fezar tudo 2023 demorar  Pode deixar remake gosto coisas download grátis WiiU importante ideia  🖥📺🎮👌  WiiU remake  PS3 remake  PS4 remake  Switch remake  PS5 remake  PC remake  Xbox remake   Tem bem gosto 👌🎮📺🖥 original  WiiU ou Wii original  Xbox original  Gamecube original  PS2 PS3 PS4 PS5 original  Switch Nintendo original  PC original
When resident evil 4 the original will launch on ps5?
Надеюсь будем ждать еще и resident evil code veronika в ремейке тоже не плохая серия с удовольствием поиграл бы в нее
Don't cancel the weapon case, the leons kicks... And most of all we believe that game needs new game + with weapon case like the original all completed
x
IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL!!!
Hopefully this one would be the same one just like the old ways!
will we have a russian voice acting?  or we second grade?
The Suffering Remake Playstation 🎮
I wonder what Ramon Salazar, Krauser, W-3, Venrdugo, and the big cheese are going to look like in this remake.
Alright Capcom, you've gotten my attention and interest in an RE game I hope this is as kickass as it looks
Resident 4 ps4
Deberían hacer el remake de “legacy of keane “
Are this re4 is remake? Like both of last re2 and re3 remake? Or this is something different?
Will I do like Resident Evil coming back i  was hoping fro this.  Microsoft allows Mac users to use X-BOX Game Pass by giving them an app Sony please give us Mac users the same thing for PlayStation Plus cloud gaming? As Windows 10 and 11 are words not self to say.
Please remake on ps2 original version on Android devices
Leon Scott Kennedy: If I could just forget what happened that night...even for a second... this time, it can be different...it has to.
FANS: "RESIDENT EVIL 4 REMAKE WILL NOT COME IN NEXT 5 YEARS" LEON: "HOLD MY HANDGUN"
Amazing ❤
I wish they kept Paul Mercier as the voice of Leon but other than that, this looks like a faithful and gorgeous remake. Can't wait.
You are full of fake games even if once there is nothing real people do Dolphin emulator
Where's everyone going, bingo?
I might be in for a remake of 4, but what about Code: Veronica?
If i hear..help me leaon!!! Im Turning it off and getting a refund lol
Now it’s time for re5 remake lol
so many spanish comments here....wow
IT BEGINS NEAAAAAAAAAHEEEEEEWWW..
I m ready to use L1+knife+kicks 😍
Ps4 también?
Please  play station bring this game to ps4
Hearing That Morir Es Vivir With Ultra Remade Graphics.
I am very excited for this, but they should have done Code Veronica before 4.
Resident evil 4 as it was awesome like the controls. Like aiming without moving made it seem more scary. I’d keep the same controls.
I can't waiting 😩
🙏🙏🙏🙋‍♂️any EMI option PS4 ps5 please sir please EMI😢😢😢😢🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Please don’t make the game looks dark. I can not see anything in the dark. My eyes hurt. I have that experience in RE6 and it did not cool. Darker does not mean Scarier. RE4 original was bright yet still spooky and scary af. Please make it easy to see, Capcom. 😅 Besides, Leon’s face show some tiredness. I understand that he must have been through a lot of drama since the zombie apocalypse happened in RE2. But Leon does not have to look like he is in drug. Leon in original RE04 was healthy and handsome, I would love to see that energy again.  Last but not least, please don’t make the adventure shorter. The original one gave me vibe of a full adventure which is very thrilling. I have played the game more than 10 times so I would expect a lots of this 2nd RE4 version.  I want to make sure the team can see my comments and hopefully they can still adjust to some of these comment. I believe you guys will read the comment.  Anyway, I’ve already missed original RE4, I’m about to play it again. Thanks the team for making me feel nostalgic. ❤️
Is this going to be a play station only exclusive?
Ps4
La verdad me causa demasiados sentimientos encontrados, mi papá jugaba este juego por las noches cuando yo ere un peque . El anotaba las partidas en la puerta de mi habitacion para no olvidar su progreso , lamentablemente el murió y me quedo ese recuerdo sujeto a este gran juego . Ojalá yo pueda jugar el remake!
Threres no for ps4??
Can’t wait to pop some heads only to have parasites coming out of them 😊
Y a  k n o w  w h a t  t i m e  i t  i s ? !
Resident evil 4 best game play station
Is Resident Evil 4 : Remake On PS4
So it’s just me that’s pumped to see how they remake Krauser? Guy was a beast.
Hope Ashley don't scream like the original game
This looks flawless
Hopefully Leon can dodge just like resident evil revelations 2. Still excited for the new controls.
"Whatt're you buy'in?"
It comes out just 4 days after my birthday and I'm claiming it as a late birthday present.
Capcom : Over here, stranger *Release teaser Resident Evil 4 Remake Player : Ahhh, i'll buy it at high price
This was the best resident evil game ever made
The nostalgia from the ps2 era.....am coming for you Ashley
Got it on the game cube,  PS4 and now finally on the PS5 next year. Its going to look amazing on my LG OLED. Let's hope it runs at 120hz
Memories 🖤
ma pe ps4 nun lo fate??, ma come c'è gioco se la ps5 nun se trova, io nun la pago 1000 euri dagli strozzini
Best horror survival game ever. Can't wait. This is a reason to buy the ps5 (if i can get one)
isso ta incrivel 🤧💟💟🥺
el momento ha llegado
Leooooooooon😊😁😁
Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeellllllllllp... Leooooooooonn!!
I'm over here supposed to be getting free games but now I got to pay money
This game and this version of resident evil is magic ... Re4 remake ❤️
time for the next gen ultra HD leave ashley at the top edge of the ladder and pull out our sniper rifles
So glad this is PS5 only!
Bruh ps5
"Ah! I'll buy it at a high price!"
Please PlayStation PlayStation 5 ko please bahar nikal dijiye na Flipkart se stock se🥺
Lookin ⒮⒞⒜⒭⒤⒠⒭ than eVer
Ashley just looks wrong
They should remake Resident Evil 0, Resident Evil 1 and Resident Evil: Code Veronica. Like if you agree!
I hope they improve the controls...
Wow i am surprise, even thought is "Remake" they not change Leon face so much not like Jill in RE3R.
I m Just Excited For Handcannon And Infinite Weapons To Shot Into a zombie Heads
Can't wait to find out what Capcom will chop off this time. Will it be Assignment Ada? Separate Ways? The Mercenary Mode? Or perhaps we'll be lucky and they'll remove all these extra modes like they did with the RE3 Remake.
Let see Crapcom turn RE4 remake is exactly like RE3 remake.
I hope its in second person like the original.
ps4 ?
Got this on the Gamecube back in the day. Fell in love. I cant wait.
😭😭😭♥️♥️♥️
Amazing
Que salga pero yaaaa
Now I get to hear “LEEEOOOON” in HD
I love this remake I waited along time I still play the original I hope theres a chance itll be like resident evil village and come to ps4
Ps4 plzzzzzz🌚
I have never buy games .but for the resident evil 4 ..i will buy this game ❤️
¡Uno de los mejores juegos vuelve!
Juego ctm buenooo weonn
No only PS5 pls  If the Spiderman Will be only PS5
To create new games? No. Why. Let’s just transfer all the games from ps2-ps3-ps4 to ps5. It will take 5 years. Then we’ll just transfer it all to ps6.. yeah… cool.
1 of the best games ever made , hope they get it rite and even better than  before , I didn’t think much of Resident evil village , to much hype train for that game ,
Wrong move. Don't fix what's perfect.
thank you @capom  for remake.
Nostalgic
I think that a highly approved improvement would be to make the cattle still NOT show signs of infection at the beginning of the game and that they interact in an ironic and / or suspicious way with Leon, being complicit in the kidnapping of Ashley and set in a daytime climate (Very clearly in the game). As this progresses, the herds become more aggressive as the weather turns night. They did something similar in RE 5, if you remember, in the intro the cattle don't attack you.
Welcome back Leon S. Kennedy!
ITS HAPPENING
Can't Wait😮
were is PlayStation premium I have been waiting for all night
no talking zombies? come on xD
تنزل على البلايستيشن او على الجوال
I swear capcom if you mess up this one just for being too focus on SF6 and make this remake another RE3 I swear I blow up a whole building  Edit: or they triying to recorrect their own mistakes with this remakes and then finally we will see a V and VI with horror survival and action in full glory as RE should always have been. Or they just want a cash grab and disappoint us as a company to all of us.  I hope I am wrong on the last option.
Does This available for PS4 🥺🥺🥺
wow this remake much more better
Welcome back STRANGER ‼️
Show ME LEON S KENNEDY AND ADA WONG AND IM BUYING IT
I love that this happened but I’m a lil disappointed they chose to reuse the voice actor from the second remake when re4 was a much more matured character who changed due to raccoon city’s incident but I’m still nevertheless excited for it
Ashley : " Leon help.. !!! "
Well I’m sad not everyone can afford a PlayStation five I only have a PlayStation for pro so I don’t even get to play this game this is irritating but it is what it is nothing about it 🥺
Para mim R4 e o melhor resident de todos. Esse será fenomenal só no aguardo
The best😭😙😎
kafayı yemişsiniz yeni oyun çıkarsanıza eski oyunları dayatıp duruyorsunuz. Re4 serisin en iyisi olabilir aynı kalitede yeni hikaye yazın.
I cant believe 🤩😍
btw i don't get the hype behind the same game? they should've created something new with similar feel to this
Thank You So Much for the Remake of this beauty, Can’t Wait 🥺❤️
One of the best game in the world 🤩🤩🤩
finally
Over here stranger 💯🧥
I hope they remake re4 but in the same vein as re2 so it is more tense atmospheric and scary with better puzzles and less all out action hero
Um forasteiro
My  reported me twice for no reason
Графон супер, тут одни эмоции
Playstation Exklusiv ?
レオンがケツアゴじゃありませんように。あとPS4でも出してください(-人-)
Hope they keep mercenaries
Sony and Capcom I love you
more than 15 years waiting for this
Is this Exclusive?? 😃
وأخييييراً نزل الريميك للجزء الرابع من ريزدنت ايفل متحمسة له مررررره🤩🤩🤩🤩🔥🔥🔥
نزلوها مترجمه
still waiting to the RE 3 remake...
podrían haber hecho un trailer más concreto… como mostrando así las cosas no
Wuoooooooou amaziiiiiing
*Un Forastero*
Wait is it only going to be for the play station?
:,)
Hope re4 remake will be better than re3 remake. Re3 remake is a disaster.
I hope I'm not disappointed. Please Sony do something epic.
I hope they really put a lot of work into this one, add new weapons maybe a krauser side campaign like assignment Ada. I hope they keep Leon’s awesome iconic lines too.
si salía welcome al final de espaldas o si se escuchaba su voz nomas al final del video si la rompias rompías el internet xd
UN FORASTERO
MEU DEUS TRADUZ EM PORTUGUÊS AFFFFFFFFFFFF😡😡😡
Скорее  бы поиграть  в этот шедевр
I know there well be a big changes like RE2 and 3 remake, I just hope it have the scary experience I expect
YESS
Will this come to Playstation 4?
Ashley shouting at Leon in RE Engine
PS4 PLEASEEEEEE 😢❤️
Where is RE3
insane
The next remake will be re 5
How to ps4
dudes they should remake thee whole entire resident evil games franchise
Is this the remastered resident evil four
Lounch ps4 iLove resident evil 4 remake and i cant ps5
Im so excited for this game i cannot wait
Нихера не понятно но очень интересно
Will it also come on ps4
Out last 3 ??????
RE 4 was amazing on Wii, I hope this is just a remake with realistic design, everything was so cool in this game! Can't wait to play it
❤️❤️
I just hope RE4 can somewhat match the original.
When will  Japan finally grow up and make adult  games like Shadow of rome again? RE is a  child game
yeaaaah
o remake mais esperado de todos os remakes da história!
This game no more in PS4?
Did they make Leon chubby or is it just me?
WOW con el soundtrack!! Y Ashley
Nooo mejor hubieran sacado el 9
Only PS5??
ah the remake of my favourite game
Waiting for regenerator
These idiots should do a code veronica remake. Re4 is a classic that needs no touching.
This would be awesome
Estos si eran rde 🤙🏻
3 days after my birthday
cant wait to see regenerator in the remake
Stop remaking games and charging retail 79.99$ that’s fucken cornball!
So, Leon has an character arc now, apparently. Nice.
Nomas diré esto si no lo hacen a la altura que es resident evil 4 que no es cualquier cosa es RESIDENT EVIL 4 tomaré un avión iré a capcom iré a poner una queja en escrito y me iré pacíficamente gracias
Türkçe alt yazılı eklemeyi unutmayın Beğenin üste dursun
wow l3ba cool
Re 8+7= 4
I wonder if there isa  merchant in this game like original one
Favorite game of all time, hands down. I'm really worried that they will disappoint, since it's such a high bar to pass.
The fact that we get a small glimpse of Leon new face in the beginning just shows us Re2 Leon model was trash 💀😭
❤️❤️❤️
I really want this game, but I dont think ill be willing to pay $60-$70 for a remastered game that came out over 10 years ago. Ill probably wait until the price drops.
Yup.
RE4 = PS4
Another remake that nobody asked for.
I just got done beating this game the other day
Iam so exicetd for this trailer
The best!
Looks so awesome, I played the original Resident Evil 4 game several times
should have been RE1R
please, keep the intro that says RESIDENT EVIL FOUR.
I booted up professional mode to celebrate oml p-mode is a headache lol
It's for Ps4?
1:38  The hype begins
That was old lady from resident evil 8
💖💖❤❤💖
شكل ليون كان جداً فخم ياليت ما تغيرونه
Hope to see Leon be Link with the kokiri sword 🗡️ forestt🎅 fighting krauser zombie mutant. tt
Hope they don’t f*ck up like the way they did to RE3
what I'm waiting for is : welcome...what are you buy it..
I hope the AI from Ashley would not be so stupid this time, or we could have the choice to switch characters during the game like in Revelations 2
why these RE remakes so dark.
حماسسس
I'm surprised and I don't know what's strange because the game has been on ps5 for a long time
Plz whats the name of music 00:21
ماهو اسم الموسيقى في الدقيقة 00:21
مدا افتهم وين الغريب اللعبة صارلها فترة موجودة على ps5 و اكسبوكس ؟؟؟؟ ماهو الجديد

Resident Evil 4 Rem🤩🤩🤩🤩
Oh great! This game is coming in my next birthday , so cool
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Ganados castle : Mobiesss tivi, Mobiesss tivi wkwkwkw
The original Resident Evil 4's musical score was some of the best of the entire franchise, so I really hope that they retain most of the music, or simply "revamp" it for this remake. Absolutely unparalleled in atmosphere and sonic worldbuilding.
Hopefully they change does horrible controllers
Lord saddle,it is settled then….mwehehe
Resident Evil 4 + DLC ( Playstation 5 / PC ) Thank Capcom Community and Playstation
Lets goooooo❤️❤️
for ps4 please :C
That touch of RE 8 looks fantastic on him.
"Morir es vivir" time
Resident evil 6 Remake 💜
🌵
اتمني ان لا تدمروا اللعبة يا كابكوم كما فعلتم مع ريميك الجزء الثالث
this game is already scary AF, I had it on my wii then that stopped working so I had to buy it again for my PS4, I didn't finish it before so I'm trying to finish it now  if I had a PS5 I'd ask myself "do I really want to replay this nightmare again ?"
Vivir es morir.
Los genados
Will the animation where you look at her skirt from the bottom be kept?

Eu estou sonhando ????
Can't wait to play this remake ♥️♥️♥️ I've played Re4 on all possible platforms can't wait for the ps5 one
MORIR ES VIVIR, MORIR ES VIVIR
Kein Interesse , Grafik im Trailer schon so naja.
I am shocked; I haven't heard any "Leoooonnn" in this trailer. :p
This can’t be true
Iam waiting for ducky bhai techno gamerz and beast boy shub to play this game
I am still crushing on Ashley Graham ❤️😂
Please Remake  resident evil 5
So it won't be on the ps4?
I'm being forced in buying a PS5
Un forastero!!!
I don’t think this is a right thing to do do man cause Leon’s actor actually passed away right after the 2 remake of resident evil
PlayStation for life
ashley looks like "hit or miss women tiktok "
„Cochelo,cochelo“
Gracias, infinitamente gracias💪🏼
We need 2 part of this game, since RE2 remake, it looks like not gonna long as the original one
"Te voy a hacer picadinho!"
Wow,👌👍👏👏
I only fighting with Ramon salazar
🥹🥹
Oh my... Babysitting Ashley in Ultra HD graphics.  I Can't wait, I Hope it will be in PC also.
yes yes yes 😄😄😄🎉🎉🎉
Nothing wrong with the real game
“What are you buying?”  Looking forward to hearing the merchant say that to Leon. LOL!
Love the scenery so much in this game One of the bests🙌🏻
Wweeeeelcome !
So this is finishing off the zombies? And the flamenco in video input lol
merchant: haha, what you are bying capcom : haha, when you are bying
Espero que pongan las VOCES DE ESPAÑA no LATINAS y espero que no la caguen, porque es el juego con mas remasted que habido.. Un fallo y se arruinan jajajajaja
czyli znowu odgrzewany kotlet, Capcom się skończył…… dobra to kiedy ten „wyczekiwany” remake Skyrima? (LOL)
Do this on ps4 bruh
PS4 😢
It should come on ps3 as far as graphics are concern
RE 4 was the best in the series thank you so much Capcom,letz go!
siiii
That mf franchise so beautifully made that even remake keeps popularity after 17 years of release.
Whatreyoubuyin
adaaaaa!!
i hope it will be available in ps4
Not impressed. You can make it look pretty, but you can’t capture the performances of the original cast. Why is it everyone is afraid of the female form? Why cover up Ashley’s body and try to hide her feminine form? Is Ada also going to get the same treatment?  I’ve played the original more times than I can remember, so I’ll stick to that.
Detrás de ti
Sumpahhh bagusss bangetttt... Semoga gak kalah bagusnya sama yg originalnya
Duh pengen main tapi gx punya ps5
Finally the best resident evil game ever made is getting a remake after all these years
Where's mommy ada
wereeem wereeem welcome back 😂
Ashley lookin like Belle Delphine😩
Please be for PS4 as well 🫣
I hope Resident Evil 4 Remake is more or little bit more terrifying than the original.
Buying it yes definitely 👍
Onimusha final fight  deep down  plase 🙂
Im so excited for this game!! Love how they kept the same Leon model from RE 2 remake, he looks HOT🔥
New uncharted game plase 🙂
March 24, 2023 is the “initial” release date. I’ll wait for the “REAL” release date, delay is so common these days, more likely it’s already part of marketing.
Ən çətin şeflərdən biri Krauzer idi psn2 də uşağlıq illərim👍👍👍
Tək oyun budurki 6 dəfə bağlamışam ps2 də uşağlıqıma qayıtdım 🥺🇦🇿
Hopefully and do not cancel scenarios as a step in the resident evil 3
Everything looks great, but there was something that bugged me: at 1:29 we can see the mayor (which is great), but what's the deal with the hands? His hands look very small in comparison with his huge body.  Other than that, I swear by the almighty gods, by the time this game comes out, I'll have my PS5
wow
Now, remake Haunting Ground hahaha
Why the flamenco music?
"Morir es vivir morir es vivir" chant the Ganados Priest
Can someone tell me cause I wish I can replay all the resident evil games how many until now did they remake did they remake RE1-2-3-and now 4
クラウザーとウェスカーは出るかな？
The former "Village" Resident Evil has came back...
My favorite game oh😍💙🤤🔥🤯 yes
Now i buy a ps5  Thank's Capcom!
No PS5👎🏻
Xbox
Still Leon help?
Hype izzzz Real Woah 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
I'm gonna buy this
🤮 Original my Best frend
"Oh hey, the remake looks promising." "Title: PS5 games"  "This is going to be released for the PS4 too though, right? *Right?"*
Esta muy buenoooooo😍
Genial
only ps5 ???
UN FORASTERO!
I really hope they’re not turning it into a horror game
You know what, the remake Leon actor sounded like the original Resident evil 4, Leon voice. The animation looks so beautiful and terrifying at the same time! I heard the Resident evil 2 team worked on this, and I have a feeling the Big Cheese is gonna be like Mr. X and Nemesis where he stalks you. Ugh, if it true. The girl who running must be Ashley. I been hearing rumors that Clare will be in it. Ada dress looks the same to me, even if it looks kind of different. I been seeing pictures of the Gandos, they look demonic I could been wrong once the game is fully out. Can’t wait to see Ramon, Salazar, Big Cheese, Krauser, Gandos, Plagas, wolves, dog, Verdugos, Regenerador, Del Lago, Garrador, Queen Plaqa, Store Keeper, El Gigante, and U-3, looks like being realistic
Where are my peeps that wanted Code Veronica remade instead at
Written June 8, 2022 Shamefully, I never played the original RE4 when it launched in 2005, but I heard it was CapComs best RE in the franchise. I’m hoping this remake is 100% like the original so the fans can enjoy.  Also maybe eventually, it’ll come to iPad so the mobile players can enjoy.
ps4 getirin berke abim kızıcak yoksa size
They skip code Veronica?
What use of producing PS5 titles when you can’t even cater to the demand for the consoles?
Is it gonna be on ps4?
Merci j'avais pas fait le 4 sur gamecube la je vais l'avoir en remake comme le 2 et le 3 au top !
Lian:Ashley.up stairs (F..forgot the Name):OK.Its the game time
Lol why not you release it on ps4 too
Ethan winters will always be remembered
Ps4 please 🙏🙏
yes
Несмотря на то, что русских тут не будут жаловать, мы все ждём с превиликим удовольствием
Leon
Ojalá sacaran para PS4
I don’t want it to be as campy as the original so I hope the game keeps the same atmosphere as the trailer, also love the sounds in this.
Really hope this game retains the campiness of the original and capcom didn't make it too serious and gritty.
Finafuck***lly!
Hehe.haha /Thank you  Come.back/Anytime 😏😏
Please, I want to hear the "Resident Evil... 4" when press start button, just like the PS2 game, please-please-please-please-please...
Oh boi
Anyway Justin Timberlake no more cry me a river mv  Powers vs spears please Banging Greeks no stroke guarantee
Better be better than RE3 remake 🤦🏼‍♂️
dude, please don’t tel me this is PS5 only.. most of us are still stuck in PS4 land and won’t have a shiny new PS5 for what seems like years.
Idk if i'm interested. Looks way too much like the original but with better graphics. And the theme is too similar to RE Village.
I don't have pc , I will play all my favourite games in future ,it's my hobby ...
LEOOOOON, HELP!.
Os speed run devem esta querendo ficar em coma pra acorda em 2023 kkkkkk
This looks more horror, like the original prototype of RE4
👎👎
Leon is back bro
that opening really have some Ace Combat Zero vibes!
Unfortunately, it seems they're completely dropping the corny but iconic 90s action B movie aesthetic for a dark and moody Zack Snyder-esque direction. I'm absolutely not a fan of this, hope I'm wrong... Just hearing this game described as "reimagined" already raises several flags for me. At the very least, the original game is still available and unlike the rest of the remade RE games, aged extremely well and didn't need a remake at all imo (not to mention there's the excellent fan-made RE4 HD Project), though a graphically overhauled remaster à la Bluepoint's SotC or Demon's Souls would've been much better.
aaand the old remaster still looks better.
Resident Evil -4 Any Possibility to Release in PS4 .....
Very nice....i wait for this Game long time ago......Greetings from Dj Oldschool...!!!!!
Can i playing this game for my ps4 pro?
Leonnnnnn helppppp
Forasteiroooo
Toooop
Welcome back stranger
Hopefully, Ashley can get down the ladder by her own now
Super my favourite
Fml. Make a new game instead of just remaking old stuff.
Can't wait to see Leon doing suplex in 4k 😂
i hope this one  takes longer then the RE3 remake
I'd rasted ni pe shield
saddler voice is bad .. likes for the original
What y buying stranger
the way Leons legs move while walking makes me worried. I think that RE2 REMAKE looked better
*¡Mátalo!*
🤯👏🏻
Skyrim: There is no other game that has more ports and remakes then us. RE4: Hello There
RE 8 with Leon.S Kennedy
هههههههههههه بعد سنة نايس
This is facking trailer!!
Neden Ps4 ve Ps5 değil sadece Ps5 için böyle olması gerçekten üzücü
I hope the next remake is going to be Outbreak 🙏
Bom, eu só espero que o RE4 seja dublado em português
will ashley being usefull for leon except open a door? we'll see
This is it, the restored piece of legendary treasure
أعظم اعلان ممكن تشوفه 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 الحمااااااااااس مليووووون

Tinha que ter o cara falando  RESIDENTEE IVOOOOO FOOOOOOORRRRRR
HOW MANY PESETAS DO I NEED TO HAVE THE MERCHANT IN THIS REMAKE?!? Also leave the striker glitch 🙏 🙏 🙏
돈콤 놈들 일 안하고 사골만 준내  끓이네? 그리고 베로니카 먼저  맹글어야 대는데 이건 어쩔TV?  ㅇㅡㅇ? 9이랑 레벨3나 빨리  맹글어와라, 일해라 돈콤!!!
lets be honest, we've all been waiting for this since they remade the second one
It looks very great 👍😃🤩 I want to play it right now ❤️🤩🧟
I played this game for over 17 years , and now i am so hyped for the Remake , capcom you better not ruined it
牛逼啊，迫不及待想玩了
tener que esperar tanto :C
RE4 is what sold me to the franchise!
Mírenlo! Está heridooo! 🤭
I hope it’s third person
Finally ... ❤️
Jogar vai ser uma experiência e tanto, para aqueles que já zerou muito ps2, vai ser surreal.
Didn’t this re realease on ps4 now on ps5
yes!! top 3 best games ever created
Yassss
Now i'm gonna terrified by regenerator in HD!?
It would be fun seen two Don Jose's at the same time with those graphics
I remember playing this on my gamecube as a kid and shittin bricks🥹thank you !
O jogo remake mais esperado da década
Yessssss
I wonder how Salazar is going to look in this new remake… my guess is that he’s a lot shorter. But jokes aside I think this remake will be a hit. Im already in love just by looking at this reveal 😍
No Paul Mercier?
Aaaahhhj...la cambana....
Se essa voz for do Saddley deixou a desejar
I really hope the level of gore won't be toned down which likely to happen. RE4 has the most gruesome deaths happen to Leon in the entire series so far after all
that is insane and very cool maaan !!
my favorite game bruh played it on the ps2 so glad it's remastered
Tá muito tooop❤
Bring it Also to ps4.
Nostalgic times of NGC
Credo RE4 já deve ter tido umas 37 versões já, kkkkk 😂😂😂
Got some rare things on sale, stranger!
No mms como que hasta marzo🙄
So... NO screaming villagers and NO chainsaw buzzin' ... Lame trailer.
If this game is not for PS4, I will kill myself😔
Regenerator its coming
Saddler, you're small time.
¡LUIS! ♥️
Help me Leon aaaaaaaaaaa
i can't wait
в конце леон уплывет на невидимом гидроцикле
A masterpiece with a remake that’s going to also be a masterpiece. 😎 I look forward to this classic. It’s going to be better than Village.
Is that all, stranger?
Cant Wait
At least ONE FRAME but cinematic?? Ofc no! We're gonna to sell you your expectations. Use imagination and pre order! FASTER!!(before real gameplay will be shown)😂
Oh yeah time to kick it real old school
Je ne suis pas un pigeon, je ne suis pas un pigeon, je ne suis pas un pigeon, je ne suis pas un pigeon, je ne suis pas un pigeon, je ne suis pas un pigeon .......... Et merde je sens que je vais craquer !
Le castle zombies: Mowgli has finished 🤣🤣🤣
Soy fan de chris pero este juego es genial y mi infancia,lo quiero ya.
Captain wesker ! Where is chris !?
Trailer de re4 remake Yo: como se veran los calzones de ashley remasterizados.
Still have the original RE4 for ps2. One of the greatest games ever
the castle is gonna be beautiful😭
One of my favourite residents evil
I hope the chainsaw man is still in this. He was terrifying but the remake wouldn't be the same without him
It will launch on Ps4 Or not.
PA ADELANTE Y DISPARA: EL JUEGO
Really excited !! Thanks for remake capcom 🤗
My only reason to stay alive until next year
Im waiting.thanks Playstation.💙💙❤💙❤💙❤💙💛💛💛💛🧡💜🧡💚💙

The best RE is coming
The world will ablaze if there's a res 4 part: 2  Where Leon returns for unknown reasons but things have changed
Si le cambian la falda por shorts a Ashley  Te mueres xdxdxd

How many times will y'all buy resident evil 4 XD
Ojalá lo doblen a español 🖤
hlo bbs
THIS GAME USE 2 GIVE NIGHTMARES AT PS2,,, DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN AT PS5??
Was kind of hoping Capcom would also make a Code Veronica remake
Heh heh heh.  What are ya' buying?  What are ya' selling? Microtransactions.
Love to see the merchant's iconic lines "What do you selling?"
Now I can't wait for the screaming of "LEON HELPP"
Absolutely gg
Tomara que não desrespeitem a memória desse jogo como fizeram com RE3 Remake. Aquilo foi um escárnio, parecia uma DLC de RE2 Remake.
I hope its not the same mecanics as resident evil 2 or 3 remake.
Now this is Resident evil 4  Better than this game  There's none !! And that's a fact
Dino crisis when
Weeeey
Para que quiero juegar un título que ya jugué en su tiempo? Solo por los gráficos  de actualidad?
I can hear them screaming... *¡un forastero!*
Caramba está bonito vey
*CAN’T WAIT*
Legendary game
OMFG but what about using Leon's original voice?
This is how I remember the graphics to be like
Ok but like i didnt see anything
Resident Evil Platinums finally have continuity. 0,1,2,3, FOUR, 5,6,7 and 8.
i literally cant wait
Merchant: Hehehe Welcome Backk
Finally, we can again hear Ashley constantly yelling "Leon" in 4K resolution 😂😂.
just hope not short like the rest of the remakes been
Lo jugare. Justo cuando termine mi aventura con el juego original y completarlo 😎😎😎
i hope they add something new in this remake
We can now see the villager leave his shoes on the stove in today's graphics.
I'm so happy Sony has been going back remaking their classic RE games.  Resident Evil is a series I feel is for a lifetime..these games just don't get old and the early batches of stories are terrific.  I really hope they go back and do even more.  I don't think I'll ever get tired of Racoon City or the Mansion. I feel like there so many other stories that could be told that was going on during that time from other characters
At least americans will learn about flamenco now!
asley si beban bakal muncul kembali
Censors flirting .... Cucks
LÁZARO BARBOSA DE SOUZA
la plagas is back on action
PS4? what not?
So stupid…… that I have to wait until next year. I WANT IT NOW
I was eagerly waiting for this moment. But why release is so late 🥲
礙事莉回歸～ 新的惡夢又要開始了
Krauser ?? Merchant ??
up play staeshan uppppp
My all time favourite
Well. Seems to me the next one will be Skyrim.
Yes yes yes  resident evil 4 come back bro😍 Merchant: "welcome" "Come back anytime" 😭😭
Ps4 🤡
Honestly I’m tired of remakes… RE4 was a masterpiece and this is just some fast cash.
Caraca vão reaproveitar tudo do residente 8 pra fazer o residente 4 é incrivel!
Another remake yay 🙂
IMPRESIONANTE !!
Depois da falta de respeito com resident evil 3 remake eu não pretendo investir dinheiro nesse.
Ashley pantsu remake 4K
Lion s Kennedy 👑
can't wait to hear "LEOOOOON, HEEEEEEEEEEELP!!!"
Please don't remove krauser
"He he he thank you!"
Didint play remake of res2 and res3 but i will this one.
Leon ! HELP
Ashley channnn 😍😍😍
Bad!!!
I loved the trailer but leon's old voice was something else.....
I really love re series, specially re4. But do we really need a remake for this masterpiece?
これは熱い
Ps 4?
leon help!!!
My all tym fav game  Best game ever made Best among all the franchises ❤️
finally a re4 remake at modern hardware is just insane
this is what I was looking for....
أتمنا تضيفو رزدنت ايفل 4 على PS4
are we gonna hear ashley calling leon again like “LEON HELP”
No way I'm have ps4 but i can sel it buy xbox?🗿
i see they adding more of the resident evil 4.5 to this cant wait love this game been on every consol from gamecube - ps5 if u can believe it
🔥🔥🔥
This and 6 was the best resident evils ever made
I hope PS4 has a port too, RE 2 and 3 on PS4 look amazing, this could easily run on PS4
Wow can't wait
Question is will they keep the currency pesetas because when the original game came out Spain had already changed to the euro
Yes!!! I cant wait for that Perfect Game!
Wow big change
Great game, but for me not my Number 1 RE game, still very awesome game.
Is it only going to be on PS5..?
So many memories from back in the day, when we played this on ps2.
So hyped for this. Looks incredible so far and RE4 is one of my all time favourites. Really hope they keep the village and castle largely similar, wouldn't mind a bit of a freshen up on the island area though as I don't think it matched up to the others
hola
Annoying flashing strobe lights throughout the whole trailer.
HELP ME LEON!!! HEEEEEELP!!
LEOOOONN! HEEEEEELP!!!!
Am i the only one who wants the old controls but slightly updated? I mean, the new system is cool and all but RE4 was about the new (back then) controls. Loved it that you couldn’t just move around while aiming haha. Call me crazy but that’s part of what I loved about the older RE
One my favourite & scariest childhood game 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Can we look up the skirt again?  Edit: Oh and will she scream my name every few seconds too? LEON LEON LEEOOOON!!!
I need the remakes of resident evil outbreak 🥺
is it gonna have the dog?
يارب تنزل على ps4
GRACIAS CAPCOM😍🥲❤️
Morir es vivir 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
It’s not fair that it not coming to ps4 becuse every game that came out it’s always on ps4 and ps5
No problem White House  Univisión building Miami is eternity rock bottom all seeing 👁 we love you Gaga
Ja man
Por favor no pongan la cámara móvil 🙏🏼🙏🏼
Me gustaría que los juegos de Ada se mantengan y sean por separado
Nos deberían decir para cuando el próximo trailer 🙏🏼
Thank you capcom for making our dream come true ! ❤
Nie odpierdolcie znowu maniany i dajcie polskie napisy
Welcome back, Leon & Ashley! We've been waiting for you!
HEH-HEHEHEH-HEHE-HEHEHEHEE nice one stranger

pleasebegoodpleasebegoodpleasebegoodpleasebegoodpleasebegood
Can’t wait til resident evil 5 & 6 remake 🤪
Capcom must not commit mistakes with this masterpiece in their hands.
actually Ashley looks atleast like a young woman 😊.
I'm really looking forward to move that camera any direction I want without it turning back by itself and walking while pointing my gun 😤
Cant Waitttt🤩🤩🤩🤩
Wow awesome…..if only I could actually find a PS5 to buy in the store…….
I can't wait to order Ashley to hide in dumpsters again.
UN FORASTERO!
Y dino crisis pa' cuando apa??
I've got mixed feelings about this.
Y si lo hubieran lanzado un día 24 de un mes 4 del año 2024? Sería algo.......ni se cómo describirlo :'v pero ningún creador haría eso porque sería mucha coincidencia
I swear. Leon never gets ugly.
Wow🤯
Bye Buddha spell in Asian dna or human trafficking pattern no unique looks right Vishnu no more suicide freak

*_L E O N H E L P , H E L P M E L E O N!!!_*

Este momento justo este momento de mi vida se llama felicidad 😍
Please don't mess this up!!!
Wow amazing
2023? блять
im very excited
Whattaya boyin?
so Code Veronica gets no love?
Is this a remastered version of the original game?
Over here stranger
They gotta tone down the crazy over the top action in this one because after this the series went down hill. A more grounded tone is needed.
Finally
😍😍😍😍
para mi que estan quemando la franquicia a mas no poder
Running out of ideas to make new games so they keep remaking old games boring asf
They should have hired Paul Mercier, this Leon is supposed to sound more confident and chill.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Un forastero! Where's Code Veronica?
Remake, remastered, reboot. Stupid developer shouldnt get money from us players
IS THIS A PS4 EXCLUSIVE ? PLEASE NO
Liooon! Hel me Lion! 🏃
Remaster 5 if they keep co op make it more horror then action based
Can it be march already?
Escutar novamente aquele atrás de ti imbeci
Excited
Finally re4 remake can't wait
Silent hill REMAKE PLEASE 🥲
Should have been CVX. 4 doesn't need it.
merece la pena seguir viviendo ¡viva la play!
Breve no computador!
I hope it doesn't get the re3 treatment
Dioos literal llevo esperando esto años
Lo unico que quiero ver es la imagen y la jugabilidad que le van a dar a los regeneradores, el gigante, los garradores,  el U3, los novistadores, los lobos, las plagas y los verdugos... Con esta ambientación oscura será terror en estado puro 😎🤘
@mikewave
Este juego va hacer una mega BOMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Will they release it for ps4 as well ?
CAPCOM has really got back into the swing of things and hit their stride with the Resident Evil franchise since 7 and the remake of the 2nd game. I trust they'll do just as amazing with the reboot of 4.
I want sleep now and wake in 3.24.2023 🔥
Będą osrane gacie.
I still need to play the RE 2 remake. I’ve never played resi games, both original and remakes I feel like I’m missing out, but I’m so far behind I cba 😂. I do find myself watching death montages and what not here and there for this franchise I dno why. All I know is that the regenerators will look hella sick in this
Me hicieron volver a sentir cómo un niño cuándo era feliz y no lo sabía . Simplemente gracias ❤️
Please, can we walk n' shoot at the same time?
My favorite in RE series
Nice
Why sony don't have real Indiana Jones ?? You have stupid lego Indiana Jones
It's me or they just intend to remove the spanish voices of the ganados. Please don't remove this, it was 99.9 %  of the game !!
3rd person please 👌
This just made me want to replay RE4, haven't played it since 2012. Don't really care for remakes.
😁
just waiting to see JACK krauser
Thank you play for this!!
Played the original back in 2007. I’ve played countless great games in my lifetime and the original will never be topped for me as the greatest game I’ve ever played.
1 day after my birthday, well done capcom
Pra ps4 né né Sony ps4 sonyyyyyyyyyy
Can’t wait to see Salazar hilariously in HD
Why Ps4 its not avilable
Zzz
I hope all the bonus weapons are in
Yo solo espero que esta vez podamos avanzar aun que se nos vaya al cielo la ashley
Que cool tardísimo se me ocurre verlo ಠ益ಠ pero aún estará grandioso ya revivieron una parte muy buena de mi infancia ojalá y ya lo pueda jugarlo uy así que acércate lion Kennedy (✷‿✷)
Cant wait to hear ashley scream over and over again saying leon help
I hope they stick to the source material faithfully and not remove sections like RE3 remake.
very bad, the worst game of RE
LEEEEEOOOONNNNNNN!
I am so excited to download Re4
Ps4🙏🏼🙏🏼
شكلها حتكون اسطورية😍
I want new games not remake
Надеюсь в рашке выйдет
Efsane😍
Je l’ai fini 20 fois  J’espère qu’il vaudra vraiment le coup
Não estrague esse jogo Capcom. Por favor
Please dont remove the "Serenity" theme of  the save room 🙏
PS4??????🙏🙏🙏
This RE4 it will be chaos
sheesh
I hope they don't make this into a game dedicated for speedrunners. Again.
They would make more money if they port it to ps4 too
PS4?
un forastero!!
LEOOOOOOOOOOOOON -Me and Ashley
06/06/22
NANI!!??
Is that shot of luis from the ambush inside the house part ????
too bad , i just bought RE4 HD from steam for my pc.. but.. it's okay better than PS2 emulator.. because my pc is low end 😓
PS4 ? 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Re4 remake vai ser épico
im gonna be optimistic after the great assassination of RE3 Remake. And Re4 wasn't that great to begin with
It looks beautiful, I do not know what else to say, this will be the only reason to buy a PS5.
"We in Kazakhstan DO NOT support the war in Ukraine, this is our official position, please add a separate region for Kazakhstan in order to avoid them in the event of the next and already coming sanctions, since we have nothing to do with them! KAZAKHSTAN DOES NOT SUPPORT THE WAR! WE DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE WAR IN ANY WAY!"
Really hope they don't butcher it like the re3 remake
I'LL BUY IT AT A HIGH PRICE
Fighting Krauser is going to be insane
😍😍😍
Porfavor que esta vez los zombies gallegos no suenen como si fueran de México solo pido eso
I read some lady sued capcom for her art they stole when making resident evil 4. Hopefully they cleared up the mess
busco sugar mami ;-;
At this rate, we’ll have a remake of Resident Evil Village in 2032.
I have also played the older version of RE 4 but looking to  trailer it looks like it will be more interesting
Mano uma das melhores noticias que recebi esse ano, infelizmente não jogarei porq o ps5 não tenho 😥
Cant wait to hear Ashley saying pervert🤣🤣
The community needs to listen to Paul Mercier and Carolyn Lawrence in the main characters 🥺
I'm glad to see horror games are making a comeback
SIIII !!
will this be availabale for PS4 too???
Mis expectativas se cumplirán cuando salgan los tentáculos y las bazucas del presidente de Estados Unidos en H.
Buenas tardes, para mi resident evil 4 fue en su tiempo uno de los pocos juegos que me marcaron para siempre. En éste nuevo remake para mí lo más importante seria que profundizaran más en la historia de los personajes principales del juego y también en los aldeanos del pueblo. Me gustaria ver por ejemplo, como llega Salder al pueblo y que les dice a los aldeanos para que se inoculen las plagas en sus cuerpos. También como sería la vida de los aldeanos antes de que llegara lord salder a meterse en sus vidas. Gracias, un saludo..
The Chainsaw man: Ahhh yess my childhood nightmare
Member when RE4 was an action game? Yeah I member.
I'm crying 1😭😭😭😭💓💓💓
My only experience with this game was on the Wii. I’m super hyped!
Does Ashley gonna make us angry in this remake as well??!
Song please ?
So i cant play it on pc?
Esperemos que los españoles sepan hablar español en este juego
This video games looks like game I play on Nintendo in last decade
WOW...WOW...WOW... I WANTED REMAKE OF RE4 FOR SO LONG......CANT WAIT...
Sonho realizado com sucesso!❤️❤️❤️
0:10 why is the date in some retarded format? there is no 24 months...
All aboard the Hype Train. :)
It'll be on PS4?
pls dont make leon's pants so baggy
I hope they don't change the AGARELO
Llegados a este punto quiero que saquen versiones de Resident Evil 4 en todas las consolas, como la ps1, la n64, la snes, la dreamcast etc.
Can’t wait for them to remake RE5 so we can finally have Chris punching grass skirt African natives in 4K
Bin ich dumm oder ist Resident evil 4 nicht schon draußen? (Ja endlich einer der auf deutsch schreibt make DEUTSCHLAND great again again again)
F não tenho ps5 :(
palhaçada essa demora prolongada
cant wait to see what unnecessary stuff they censor
My money is ready
Uhh yeah but why it doesn't even remotely feel like resident evil 4 ??
Where is the remaster for “Resistance Fall of Man” one of the greatest exclusives ever 🐐
the last resident evil remake, some will understand why
My only wish is that they dont change the saving music theme
I swear I've beat this game once on GameCube and in VR
Gak sabar nungguin game nya rilis🤩
My most repayable Resi  Cant wait!!!
Yes.
My favorite "shooter" on Wii.  Would love to play the remake with a pointer.  Those controllers felt limited in a FPS, but in a game such as this, it felt great!
Rip Code Veronica for now..
😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴🙄🙄😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
Where's my Dino Crisis 2 remake?????????????????????????????? Capcom, PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!
I looooooove this game sooooooo much 😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ahhh Ill buy it at a high price
언제 기다리냐??? ㅠㅠ
Our CHILDHOOD MEMORY'S will be HD soon :D
I'm gonna be really mad if the Ganados aren't as goofy here as they were in the original.
Un forastero
김레온과 애순이 기대한다.
Love it all, kinda missing og Leon voice actor though...isn't he supposed to be more experienced and mature since RE2?
@Beastboyshub 🌝🤌
"so Leon ,we meet again"
"Welcome! I've got some rare things on sale stranger."
Estara para ps4?
地獄よりも恐ろしい恐怖！！
Can't wait to see more
Vaya mojón fe trailer:/
Ik the original was solo but please make it co op in some type of way I love re 4
I hope one day resident evil 5 remake comes out
Mega geil freu mich schon richtig auf das game
Nostalgia: the game.
Parang medyo mataba si Leon dahil sa Jacket. Umpisa pa lang naman ng teaser eh, for sure marami pa mababago haha
Ahora que acabo de pasarmelo en vr….
Wow, this is amazing, I can't wait for this
I really wanted to see a remake of this legendary game probably the best resident evil game i have ever played
why not re2 code veronica??
ААААААААААААААА
Mmmmmmmm 🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍🙃
Oh me vengo... Faraón lov shei
really hope the old voice actor for leon comes back for this one🥲
the DAY. AFTER. I BUY THE ORIGINAL.
Is there any chance that guy will survive in this remake ?
I'm 18 years old again watching this. As long as it's like the original, I am totally down for it.
Just hopefully I can survive 1yr to play this
Cogedlo. Cogedlo. Cogedlo. Cogedlo
I hope i'll be able to walk into Salazar's castle  hear "morrir es vivir" shoot the guy in the leg, and suplex him.
Arrabelo ! Morir es vivir...
@mbboy45 on t’attend pour ce jeu
*detrás de ti imbécil!* 😂
Nostalgia is hard withim Playstation...
Bellissimo io che lo giocato ai tempi su ps2 mi aspetto molto
😍😍😍😍
HERE IT IS  STRANGER
O jogo foi tão bom que irão relança-lo?
Did capcom delete some screen or some gun,or add new content
This gunna be sick can't wait 🤙🏾💯
I hope there’s rag doll physics.
Still dont think this move was necessary,cause RE4 still holds out amazingly to this day,one the best games ever created. This remake is for whiners who hated RE4,and a sad reminder that gaming industry is creatively bankrupt.
Wow
"Heh heh heh... Thank you!" Capcom ,  "Ah! I'll buy it at a high price!"
Im not feeling this new Leon model. Not even in RE2, that buttchin is just so unnecessary and wack lookin
they better not be cutting things out like they did with RE3
If the action is not over the top like original, I'm out
CANT wait for PC release as well
Morir es vivir!!! I’m so excited!!!!!
From the radio contact at the beginning, i hope Leon is not really alone in the game, i hope there is also a Spec OPS squad that operates behind the scene. Or maybe just change the two local cops to some Spec OPS squad that supposed to be leon's team and butchered them like the two local cops. Just to fix the all-time meme of resident evil 4.
01:58 Ashley looks like the model Ella Freya.
YESSSSSSSSSSSS
oyyyyyyyy Super
Can't wait to see regenerator on this one
This Trailer Surely made my day. After the remake of RE 2 i always wondered if Capcom will remake RE 4. The original RE 4 is a Masterpiece. It's a perfect game and many people were saying it don't need a remake. But this trailer surely made an impact. The game looks so beautiful and at the same time so scary. This remake will sure set the standard for what a Videogame Remake should be.  Can't wait to play it.
Junge ich kann es kaum erwarten <3
I really hope the game shows us how Leon ends up there….since we saw him, Claire, and  Sherry at the end of RE2 remake. ☺️
Is reality lol thought it was meme
"Captured in PS5", shows PS3 graphics
NO WAY FA-
Why not PS4
No for ps4?
The game that gave birth to 3rd person over-the-shoulder survival horror...
I'm gonna play this game on PS2 emulator on my phone right now ❤️
Ohh ouiiii   ca va etre  topppp ouiiiii
О. У меня на днюху прям)  23го марта. Прям как раз.
Why dont ya guys try to remaster Devil May Cry 2? Cause ı really dont think re4 needed a remake.
Go Hed-lo
This is certainly cool, but maybe instead of raising prices, open stores in Russia?
Wow
I hope Ashley will be usefull 🥲
حماس الف  بس ياويلهم مني اذا طلعت ل 5
حماس الف  بس ياويلهم مني اذا طلعت ل 5
for ps4 got?
ready for this masterpiece👌
OH YOU PERVERT !
Remake remake remake remake remake remake
My childhood 🤧🥺 I hope it will be like original, this game was (and still is) iconic
imagine the laser scene in remake.
Hype!
Next remake Code Veronica
🇧🇷Que coisa mais linda, sensacional, capcom mantém a essência do original e caprichem nos gráficose e jogabilidade,vai ser susseso,nos superpreenda! What a beautiful, sensational thing, capcom maintains the essence of the original and excels in graphics and gameplay, it will be amazing, surprise us!
Resident evil village was trash I hope this one ain’t
Would be nice if you could use a wiimote with it, wii version was the best, but I assume it's going to be analogue sticks only.
I hope they beef him up just a little bit!! Would be a great addition to his character development.
LOL NO PS4??? NOOOOOOOooooo ps4 version !!!! -.- perderan mucho dinero.
wow,that's crazy 💥💥
remake of 3 was really disappointing, please don't let us down with this capcom
I will leave my girlfriend for this game  If I have one
🌷💕🔥💓🌹🥰😘🤍
🥰🤍🤍💓💕
💕🤍😘❤️‍🔥🌷🥰🌹💓💕🔥🥰🥰😘

1:43 it sounds like Far Cry 4 menu
Maaan the wait is over ❤️
le plue beau jour de ma vie
"Morir es vivir"
Dino crisis : okey You forget me Now...
I'm waiting for Ava bikini mods
ANJAAY AKHIRNYA
My best part!  Leon! Help!
Morir es vivir, morir es vivir..
All I needed to hear was the sound of the Spanish guitar. At that point I knew we were in for a treat.
I wish they hire the same Leon re4 voice actor
Leooon heeeelp
Miss mr regenerator
Ada Wong!!!!!!!!!!!!! 💖🔥
I'd almost given up hope.
00:42 01:21 01:30
When will you distribute minecraft?
I wonder if they’re gonna keep the peeking feature with Ashley😂
Excited to play RE4 with the gameplay. Thank you
Beastboyshub would be shocked after seeing this
UN FORASTEROO!!!
Thank you for making this remake ,gonna buy this game soon as it's released will be so nostalgic to play it with awesome graphics.
Viva Las Plagas!
Não anunciaram que terá para PS4, mas acho (quase certeza) que isso é de propósito, a Capcom quer surpreender todo mundo, e para mim esse trailer é justamente de PS4, o de PS5 terá um upgrade, certamente.
no was the listened to the fans this cant be real :D
juste un de mes jeux favori je l'est fini 10 fois étant petit et je m'en lasse jamais franchement trop reffet
Feels like home.
best chapter of RE games
Pls Dlc for Resident evil 8🙏
As much as I love RE4 having a remake, I just wish they don't do it like the RE3 remake. So many things removed from the original game in the remake. Disappointed on it
I was so excited for this until I found out it won't be on ps4.
no mames esta genial el remaster de RE4
Samlekom mamank 😎
🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖
wooow que bien resident regresa  el 3 del mes 24 del 2023 :D
Sin Shinji Mikami esto huele a fracaso.
Un Farestero!!!!
Abhi majha ayga na bhiduu 😎
ОЧЕРЕДНОЙ ВЫСЕР
“What’ya buyin?”
Hyped af
Was really hoping for Code Veronica to be next
希望卡表炒的冷饭能和2一样香。如果上了电脑，碍事莉穿什么就由不得她了。
Resident Evil 4 was my favorite horror game for over 15 years and was in my top 5 favorite games until I played The Evil Within 2 but im definitely buying this and it may become my number 1 favorite horror game
Вот, что мне не нравится в " resident evil ", это длинная ночь  Хотя игра смотрится красива
No PS4 then? :( Damnit!
If in this version Ashley doesn't yell "Leon, help" every 5 sec I'm not interested
The intro with that guitar is so nice I've heard it like 100 times by now
lets hope its not 4 hours long
Wow! You got permission from a jacket company to use their bomber jacket. I wonder if it is only for the trailer or will it get put in the game.
Still no Parasite Eve? No Legend of the Dragoon?
Sevemuybien
Can’t wait to see ada and leon scene…
Reminds of village 😎
He'll yes re4 best re game ps2 game cube wii ps3 Xbox 360 Xbox 1 ps4
I'm serious... If the monks don't talk like idiots "ahí está" I won't play the game!
I'm looking forward to Resident Evil 4 Remake, I will play this in PSVR 2
Why do we need it?
Could Capcom top a Masterpiece? I think re4 doesnt need a remaster cause is already perfect.
I hope resident evil four remake is not on par with resident evil three remake
Fiquei até ecitado 🥵🤤👌🏼
Resident Evil 4  Ramake -  PS5 March 24 , 2023 - Trailer - Coming Soon 03, 24, 2023
Hands down the best game in this franchise
Dhr
Where is RE VERSE !?
What 'er ya Boyyin'?? = If they don't bring the same VO actor to reprise the role of the Merchant = BAD REMAKE.
This part of my life... this little part is called happyness...
I Wonder how they will do the Rollercoaster in the Castle
It would have been cool if the person who made Leon's original voice did it again for the remake
I need this opening song in my life
If the game is going to do exactly the same as the trailer, Surely will be the best game in history.🔥🔥😱
This is how you do a remake Rockstar
Poggers
RE4 has a special place in my heart.😁
I'm not quite sure this game needed a remake. I mean, the HD versions did the job. There's nothing else to add. It was perfection.
¿Where is Code Veronica Remake? 😠
I wonder if this is going to be like FFVII: Remake based on what Leon says at the end.  I have a feeling that they will recount certain parts, but in the end it will be something more. At the end of the trailer Leon says he wishes he could forget the events that happened. Then he goes on to say "This time, it can be different. It has to".  Unless he's referring to the events of RE2.
*Ashley: - HELP ME LEOOOON!!*
Can’t wait
Could you at least use the original voice actors!!!
Chief Mendez is literally ripping of Mr. X's look. Now he's wearing a hat too
wooooo here we go with the nigthmares of screams of that demon with blonde hair
Diálogos censurados kkkkkk
sem necessidade, pra que mexer num jogo que continua super atual e envelheceu bem, tudo dá capcom é remake, mais fácil pra eles pegarem um jogo de sucesso e usar o nome pra ludibriar , do que trabalhar em algo totalmente novo
I understand the earlier games been remade but RE4? Nah. It seems to just be me though so I’ll just show myself out 😂
Ada wait!
Is it free?
So sad this new resident evil will no longer in PS 4 😢
Ta' potente 👍🏻
No me cagues el juego Capcom que sea original. Y ponme al león guapo 😡☝️.
PlayStation exclusives are annoying. I just want to play the game i don't want to buy a whole new console to do that.
Ay mamasita que emocion los dejo k se me queman los frijoles
impatient
no puede esperar a ver que se lo pase y lo suba completo en su canal jordi wild
1:20 Of course they give us a glimpse at the Mauser Red9...
Morir es vivir
Pongan el online gratis
This game doesn't need a Remake so I think I'll be skipping this one.
Un forastero, avisar a los demas...
Biohazard 4
if you cant suplex enemies ill be really disappointed
Kheeeeeee❤️
I really hope they go all out with this. If they do this right this can become the GOAT.
YES! they gave Leon decent look and not look like a peter puffer. Thank you Capcom
ps4 or ps5
on ramadhan release ... yeay !!
My favorite RE ❤🙏
Punto negativo: le cambiaron la vestimenta a ada que eso es algo muy importante por que ella llevaba un vestido rojo en el re4 original  Puntos positivos: los gráficos son increíbles, León esta increíble conserva todavía su mitica chaqueta que tiene en el juego original, la voz de León esta bien para mi, se ve también que incluyeron a la ballena zombie que eso es espectacular y tambien aparece luis será  Igual es un trailer, mucho no se pudo ver, solo espero que la historia del juego sea casi igual que la del original y que no cambien cosas importantes como el maletín, las armas, los primeros jefes y escenas de esquivamiento como la del pez gordo en la batalla final y la de krauser cuando pelean con cuchillos en su primer encuentro.
lol when they shaped the N, I was thinking its gonna be a netflix show 😂😂😂
Woo, I played this game in 2006 in a PS2 and now with the new generation consoles this see it incredible.
Leonnn helppp!!! started again 😊
Ojalá que no allá cambiado mucho la historia
i wonder how they approach the part where with the Girl. I'm getting flashbacks of the "Leon" screams.
"Detrás de ti imbécil", justo en la infancia,  espero poderlo jugar esta joya de residente evil!
Woooooooo!!!!!!!
I wish it was for the PS4 also
This is too much milking
Depois do "maravilhoso" remake de GTA SA, faço as palavras do Leon as minhas 1:53
no way yes🎉❤❤
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Mega Nice 🤗 thank you Capcom ❤❤
Looks clunky
Наконец-то
Bring me the Iron Maiden, my favorite enemy in any RE game.. Was really hoping to see it return in RE7 and 8. Missed opportunities lol
im so tired of studios remaking games.
Daaaang girl you losing that Russian war  Swing at his manhood  Bla

Regenerator trauma...
2032 : Remake of remake👍
Now do re5 and re6 😄
Is it going to be available for ps4????
I’ll pick this up when it’s $20 because by then I’ll have a PS5
It's sad Capcom has nothing to offer anymore besides remaking their old games ...
Surprised they didn’t just slap on a funky Kong mode to the original and called it a day.
Trailer de revelação que não revela nada.kk
👀
¿De verdad van a vender otro remake de otro resident evil? ¿Estamos faltos de ideas? Y si algo funciona, explotarlo hasta la saciedad ¿no?
I hope the controls are better and no quick time bs
Por fin 😍
No lo puedo creer!!!!
What ya buying?
amazing
Why does it not say psvr2 support here and it did on the state of play, I think it’s because you accidentally leaked the psvr2 release date 24 march 2023👀
Leoooon help
The graphics  Night screen 100% like horror movies and real
Release the ps4 version
After what they did to RE3 I have very low expectations.
I can't wait to see what Mercenaries will look like especially "Hunk" NeckBreaker
Agarrenlo, no lo dejen ir.
I'm so excited for the Merchant
Welcom stranger!! Again!!!
LEON, HELP!
No me gustó el trailer Pero espero que sea un buen remake Porque re4 es una joya
I can't wait for playing this powerful game!!! Hope the remake is as strong as the original!
This is just hype
Capcom: Let’s Remake an Old Classic.  Also Capcom: But let’s cut out half the content of the original.  Loved RE2 Remake and super excited for this but hopefully this isn’t a RE3 Remake situation all over again.  RE3R they had the opportunity to take one of the best classics of all time and make it better.  Instead they chose to make it worse.  You can’t even play the beat version of RE3R until you get to nightmare difficulty.
So existed to see krauser in this remake next year. 🗡🖤✔️
RESIDENT EVIL 4 REMAKE ❤️ XBOX ONE S/X 👍 PLAYSTATION 4 👍
The character looked older in the original here they looked like teenager
Childhoods adventure and fun coming back in most terrifying way 😍😬
Wow 👏👏👏👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍👍😃😃😃😃😃😃🙏🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
my best resident Evil game 😍😍😍😍
Re2/3 should have been a bundle. I will wait for this to price drop. I can’t continue to pay 60 bucks for a remake with little replay value.
I remember my aunt used to play it when I was really young, today that aunt of mine is having her own baby but the game continues, it really holds alot of memories. So excited for this.
what a time to be alive
RE 4 was my fav RE game next to 3
Morir es vivir ??
With unreal engine that's will be awesome
애슐리 예뻐진거 실화
It’s a lot darker this time I hope the gameplay is a new and improved version of the original! 😤
I still have this Original one ❤️❤️
Ojala dure sus 30 horas
this game didn't need a remake
I like Ashley face here, worth to looking for :D. Can't wait to see Leon & Ada face too, must be cooler than RE2.
please Capcom, Playstation and Xbox dubbing this remake of resident evil 4 into Spanish latin america mexico in Latin America you have many fans who play your games and buy them at a cost Dubbing into Mexican Spanish and not only in remake of resident evil 4 but also in Previous deliveries, both in interface, as substitutes, and in Mexican Spanish dubbing, please not only Spaniards have their dubbing, they have to be the same with us, those from Latin America, Mexico please.  and please don't forget to remake resident evil: code: Veronica.  I would not mind paying a little more if they put the dubbing in Latin America Mexico.
por favor Capcom, Playstation y Xbox doblaje este remake de resident evil 4 al español latino america mexico en latinoamerica tienes muchos fans que juegan tus juegos y los compran a un costo Doblaje al español mexicano y no solo en remake de resident evil 4 sino tambien en  entregas anteriores, tanto en interfaz, como suplentes, como en doblaje español mexicano, por favor no solo a los españoles tengan su doblaje, tienen que ser lo mismo con nosotros, los de latinoamerica, mexico por favor.  y por favor no olvides rehacer resident evil: code: Veronica.  No me importaría pagar un poco más si ponen el doblaje en Hispanoamérica México.
can we get it on pc too
This will ever be a great success or the biggest flop. Living up to the highest rated RE game this should be fun to watch. Resident Evil 1+2 remasters where amazing. Resident Evil 3 remaster was awful. Which way will it follow.
my favourite Resi Game ever....
Resident Evil 2 2019 Masterpiece i want just like  make Resident Evil 4 another Masterpiece please please please thank you ❤
Well it’s about time
Man where’s Leon’s original RE4 va
exclusive?

Cool, many zombies again, but on ultra graphics.
I hope this remake same as orginal of course with improve, cant wait to play🔥🔥🇮🇩
Veronica X wäre besser gewesen,  der 4teil war kacke
De trás de tiii imbeci aaaaa espero q tenha a dublagem foda q nem o original.

I can't wait to be eaten alive by Regenerators in HD.
Again? 😒
Play 4?
Morir es vivir
Please sony remake re1 and re0...
Can't wait to hear again : LEEEEEEEEeeOOOON !!! HELP ME LEEEON !
WHERE'S THE SPANISH GUYS
Esa guitarrita y castañuelas...!!!! ahhhh 😍😍
scheisse 1 jahr noch sieht aber geil aus
Ansioso de mais por esse game ❤️
FINALLY!! finally, they showed us the Announcement trailer for this game, plus the gameplay & graphics on the cutscenes are perfect but are we gonna be able to switch between characters throughout the game for example we start off playing Leon but when he gets knocked out we switch to Ashley and then Ada Wong. details people, details!
I’ll wait to the end of 2023 when it’s on sale for $20 lol
perfect 🔥🔥
Wish we had Leon’s original voice.  The game has so many opportunities to fall short in many ways since the original is a masterpiece.
No way this is real. Am I dreaming?
i'm so exciting for this game
Como seran los regeneradores :0
❤
Woooooooow
😍😍😍😍
The best ever resident evil 4 ❤️
esa ashley :P
I would love a physical collection box with Remake 2, 3 and 4 + all DLC included on disc.
Out of all the RE games, this one is hands down my favorite and can't wait to lose my head a  billion times again XD
I only hope they don't cut away half of the game, like they did with RE3
It doesn't matter, gc version looks better.
It's time enhanced Chainsaw and Iron Maiden ptsd
RE great. But let's go Dino crisis
wow just wow n i was here playing re 4 on pro mode
Hermoso! Unos de los mejores juegos clásicos estará de regreso. Sin duda se viene grande!
its happening its happening
Leon in Resident Evil 4 2023:  I can't imagine the pain and suffering these villagers must have gone through, I need to find whoever is behind all of this. Leon in Resident Evil 4 2006: [scoffs], Where's everyone going? Bingo?
Leon.... HELP MEEEEEE.... but in Remake
No
Is this game coming on ps4 pls anyone tell me
"Ahh, I'll buy it at ah high price"
Best re
Joder sacar juegos nuevos  La creatividad  de la industria está muerta desde  hace muchos años
Finally,  Resident Evil 4 is coming!
Sooo exciting, cant wait to play it soon 😎😎
re4 rereremake🤣
Capcom did us dirty with RE3, so I'm gonna wait until reviews for the game start coming out before I get it. Nevertheless, I'm super stoked, man. I remember playing RE4 on the Wii when I got it for one of my birthdays in middle school. Such a fun game!
They better keep Leon's bingo one-liner
Não vou me empolgar, não vou me empolgar..... VI O VIDEO 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
We all kind of expected it to happen. It was just a mater of time. Now, how many want a remake of dino crisis?
Pra mim sem sobra de dúvidas e o melhor da franquia! Nossa passei a noite vendo esse trailer kkk ahh quero muito jogar
Top muito esperado
Will it be censored like 3?
Is that Ada Wong? 1:28
See you again Leon.
Ojala arreglen el "Puedes corer, pero no te puedes escundir" O no Jaja
I am disappointed that we didn't see the merchant asking Leon what he'll be buying.
Is this remake going to be an 18+ like the original one or have they watered it down to make it 15+ ?
I'm still waiting for. New onimusha
Can’t wait!
Who is Leon talking about in the end? Who is on the picture?
POV: you live in Southern California in 2022 and are the last sane and rational human left
wow
Wow amazing, Can't wait!
PC or Steam please 😇
Just make a new game you greedy shekel wanting pigs
Got some rare remake on sale, stranger!
Leooon heeelp me ... !!
Please remove the zombies(las plaga) using guns 😂
YOOO THIS IS SICK BUT ANYWAYS ASHLEY IS STILL USELESS 🤓
If it becomes a failure like RE3, then Capcom can save it! Since they destroyed the best part of the series
i hope ashley be more usefull😂
Siiiii!!!....Siiiiii!!!! D:< !!!
no ps4 , resident evil 4 remake sales must be dropped
Tanto tiempo esperando, y lo hicieron 😭
wasnt needed
pls the name of song
El juego mas Sobrevalorado,  con versiones hasta para la tostadora,  alejándose desde su salida del survival horror y enfocandose casi casi mas en ser un  mal shooter. Es de risa como capcom los compra con espejitos, practicamente les roba el dinero y todavía le agradecen
I hope they don't rush this one like RE3 Remake
I hope we still get the dog in the beginning. I aint fighting El Gigante without him.
I have finished the original its just awesome
I'm really excited. I hope the voice actor for Leon is Matthew Mercer or the a voice actor with a more mature vocal range for Leon. I'm also excited to see Luis Sera. Please be better than re3 tho.
Yeeeees....😍😍😍
Take your bets now, is it a horror game or action game?
I don't see much point in remaking an already perfect game.
OMFG!
Hope we can play as Ada
niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I don't know about this. The way they cut and censored parts of the VR version of game, like Leon flirting with Hunnigan, Luis talking about Ashley's ballistics, even cutting levels out of the game.  They'll probably do that for this as well.
Next Game: Devil May Cry 6. I guess🤔
La verdad no creo qué nadie este afanado Capcom, deberian hacerlo completo y bien, no hagan lo de RE3 remake, yo sinceramente aun espero mi DLC de la torre del reloj, sin cobro adicional.
8й резик хорошо заметин в 4ке ремэйк 😂 только вот 4ю плойку набрили, видать временый эксклюзив 5ой 😘
I feel sorry, sad, disappointed, it's very unfair, it's only on ps5. It should be for this resident Evil 4 remake on ps4 as well.  not everyone can afford to buy ps5. i am thankful there is ps4. moreover, resident Evil on ps4 is already a lot and should continue with new games. it depends on the game on ps4. why is there no resident Evil 4 remake on ps4?
please, there is resident evil 4 on ps4, hopefully one day ... don't just be on ps5 And PC only
I've read many people praised RE 4 but never   had time to play it. I'll make sure I won't miss this one.
I hope this game won't be rushed like RE3 Remake. The original game is already a GOTY.
I am hoping this game stays true to the original but I am hoping it leans a bit more towards horror than action.
I wonder what they're gonna do in place of those quick time event sequences considering qte's aren't really used in games at all these days.
aku haram bisa memainkan di ps2
I gotta wait till 2023?! Man.. The wait will be worth it for sure. I love the resident evil franchise!
Help me Leon !
Thats awsome one
Im glad they acknowledge that this is their best RE game to date
Thanks Capcom this chapter is my favorite ever
RE4 on the Oculus Quest 2 is game changer!! Being in the game is so intense! Hopefully they release this version for PS VR
welcome stranger
lovely 😖
after seeing this just imagine what  they'll do with 5
I want to see the new ashley's pantzu
is that Ada or Ashley? Ada wears a qipao dress.. But the hair is too dark to be Ashley.
Hopefully they keep the cheesy lines like "Where's everybody going? Bingo." or "your right hand comes off?"
Capcom is going to mess this up I’m sure but I’m still going to buy it and hope that I was an idiot for posting this.
Not buying if it misses one single detail from the original.
So excited 😭
Para cuando harán el Remake de Dino Crisis? 🥺
I hope the game will support the Ukrainian language.
Every single one of these remakes has been nothing short of a masterpiece, can’t wait
Mb re6 😒
RE 4 Ashley : Leooooon Help!  RE 4 Remake Ashley : Leooooon Yamete!
Vivement le lets play de bboy
“Welcome”
Respect
I honestly didn't want this, the original is already fine as it is. I'm not so hype about it but I'm still curious of how it turns out.
Heeeeyyyyy ive got!!
boy a comprar este juego si trae idioma español latino
people saying Capcom nailed it with RE2 remake so why can't they nail this.. whilst I fully agree with the notion of the RE2 remake being incredible, let's not forget that they screwed the pooch with the RE3 remake. they cut a lot of content from that game, whilst making Nemesis nowhere near as intimidating. I reeaaally hope they don't cut bits out of RE4, but got a horrible feeling they might do 😔
Is that all stranger......
这次PS4没上!!只有PS5上有!!! PS5还是得买!!!
"LEOONNN HEELLLLPPP... HELP ME LEON" - said Ashley calmly
We all deep down are waiting for our MERCHANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ой,вот только не обделайтесь снова,выпуская очередной "ремейк",ведь то,что Капком сделала с третьей частью игры-достойна расстрела тех людей,кто имел причастие к созданию того "ремейка".Игру просто уничтожили по факту,растеряв 60% всего геймплея,и 40% её реиграбельности.Мне такие "ремейки", сделанные "на коленках на этих выходных"-не нужны,так как стоят ваши "шедевры"-баснословно дорого.))) 🤭 🤣✌
Again? I'm not buying another RE remake until they do Dino crisis!
Gúzel oyun
I'm so excited to hear Ashley yelling at Leon for help, again!
Guys do you know if the game will be available on Switch?
So excited 💪🔥🔥
RE 4 is one of the worst parts... they should have make a remake for code veronica... or even better > Dino Crisis 1 Remake
Keren kaya di sinetron 😘😘
現在都給我在那邊重製 就飽了阿
morir es vivir
Looks awesome, but RE4 was perfect as is and Code Veronica needed the remake more.
UN FORASTERO !
Надеюсь, что трейлер не обманывает, и роскошная дубленая куртка вернётся.
Wow really 🥰🥰🥰
If Ashely doesn’t scream “Leon heeelp” I’m uninstalling
Encuentro que igual deberían tirarlo para PS4 ya que la mayoría de personas tiene PS4 se vendería más
Hold up, does the merchant guy also got remake for appearance??
Neat
I can't wait to hear the iconic "Un forastero" again.
its going to be hell'a cool
Come this for Ps4?
Help me, Leon. LEON!
Xbox
Sony do remakes of their CE errors. It’s a nightmare!
Better play RE4 on PS2. The time was gone. Let the past where it belongs. Do not wake up these museum!
🤦🏾‍♂️ better playing the original. Remakes are so stupid and the gameplay are almost always worse than the ORIGINAL. It’s just about the visual.
This is the remake
Niceee
Oh this is one of my childhood memories.Happy to see the remake version of Resident Evil 4😍
¡Agárrenlo!
Yes! :D
Il mio gioco preferito 🤩
Leon Better sound like a man in this remake or remaster. Made em sound like a teen in the RE2 NVM they did this will be a excellent game.
This is going to be insane
Es tan hermoso
1:17 that's the most fire looking fire I've seen in a video game
Louis side mission will be able.
I hope this time stranger can recieve bitcoin💰.
WoW estoy muy emocionado y ansioso por jugar esta remake
" ¿What are you buying? " Es lo que espero volver a oir.
UN DIA DESPUES DE MI CUMPLEÑO SIUUUUUUUUUU
Please I need this on ps4 I love this game so much and I want to play this version of my favorite resident evil game
Leon!!!  Helpppppp!!!! 😑
Yeah, I liked this one SO much I immediately played through the entire game again. Nice being able to keep all your gear for the second play. Can't wait!
Mods available??
I never thought it would happen. This is such a dream come true. Thank you Capcom. I can't believe it's official now. It is finally worth buying the PS5 now..
Wow it's happening!!
Excellent
Let’s hope this is better than the RE3 remake.
They should bring it to ps4 also. A remake of Legend of Dragoons is also needed!
I've never played an RE game before. Feels like they have been shoved in our faces the last few years tho.. RE 7, 2 remake, 3 remake, RE 8, and now 4 remake... Just feels like a lot for only 5 years
Thats what im waiting for
Dude PS5’s don’t even exist. 🤣
Finally 😌
no puede ser
0:11 We will survive GALM 1...
May favourite , got remake
Please, create a Ukrainian localization.  Ukraine is not Russia. 🇺🇦🙏
Please, create a Ukrainian localization.  Ukraine is not Russia. 🇺🇦🙏
Es un hecho, me comprare la ps5 para jugar esta joya
Loving this kind of "soft reboot" to the resident evil franchise. For me re4 is up there with some of the greatest video games of all time. And so far this looks amazing.
it wish it is in TPP . i am getting sick of playing FPP games like RE7, RE8. i hate FPP
que increíble
No me agrado nada que le cambiarán el rostro eso es desagradable
Ashley 😍👌
this looks way too serious compared to the original.  NO THANKS BRO.
TAKE MY MONEY
Lion Lion Lion Shut up 🤬
so nice ... Dino Crisis next
This game looks way darker than the original which is ok I just home they also keep the charm from the original
欸 真香
RE4 VILL4GE
saya benar² berharap game ini memenangkan penghargaan game of the year di tahun 2023
Leon🤩🤩🤩 the power of resident evil legendaris
Looks like the voice acting in this one will be better, at least I hope 🤣
Well!!! I'm really nervous about the moments and the kicks ? Maybe conserved or ad new?? What's going happen!! 🙂😅
It’s about Fucken time
Let’s hope it’s more like RE2 remake and less like RE3 remake.
This won’t be a true resident evil 4 remake if Leon doesn’t say “where’s everyone going bingo”
Kinda feel line the “this time it can be different, it has to” line implies there will be significant changes
"LEEEOON"
Oh another game coming to psvr 2
Sounds like they got rid of all the over the top voice performances for the villians.... sad day
Ok but if he doesn’t say “where’s everybody going, bingo?” I’m gonna lose it
ahora si me comprare la play 5
👌😎
No ps4?... 😢
" Je je je Thank You"
I’ll buy it at the highest price !!!
Thought it was a Puss in Boots game.
Pog
This is too smalltime.
LEEEEOOOOON!!!!!
I mean... not that I necessarily **hate** that this game is getting a remake, but it feels really unnecessary, especially since Code Veronica hasn't gotten a remake yet. That game honestly needs one far more than RE4, and I will admit I'm disappointed we're getting this before a CV remake.
Arguably, the best Resident Evil game in the whole franchise.
I’m both excited and terrified to see what they’ve done with the Regenerators.
si yo pueda comprar un PS5 solamente
كلاوه
the original RE4 still amazing , and this one will make me smile while playing😁
I am expecting memes.
One of the worst and terrible trailer tbh lol. But I just hope the game has tons of value to be played over and over like re4 OG did.
Sold! Looks absolute epic and even scarier than in '05
The PS5-con continues, rehashing old games.
Madre mía del señor. Voy a estar contando cada segundo
one of the greatest game of all time ..
I’m so excited 🥺🥺
This is remake
só as lendas do play 2 vai sentir a pura nostalgia dessa relíquia em 4k
My favourite Resident Evil. Ground braking game. Can’t wait to play it!
I cant believe it 😲
Please don't cut 70% of the game like we did in RE3!
Yesterday when I woke up and opened YouTube  I felt like I won’t be glad and excited more than the moment I was watching the official announcement of RE4 remake! Can’t wait to see more of my favorite characters the Agent pretty hair and the Spy in red! ❤️‍🔥
Super-geeked for it. However, given how many times I've played (we've ALL played) the original on Gamecube and PS2, I hope they expand the campaign and give us 2-3 more chapters and a bit more Ada. The OG was expansive and practically perfect in every way, but, as one of the Best Games of All-Time which has seen countless re-release, we need fresh mayhem :)
Как же убого
Please, create a Ukrainian localization.  Ukraine is not Russia. 🇺🇦🙏
*My body is ready for daddy Leon!*
La españita llena de podemitas y comunistas, duro con ellos
Where's everybody going?
Es mi juego favorito espero que sea digno de su legado , hay muchos juego buenos que envejecieron mal pero resident evil 4 lo jugo hoy en dia y sigue siendo igual de bueno que el primer dia que lo juge, no voy a altas las expectativas con este remake puede sali muy bien o muy mal no hay punto medio
C'mon Sony make it available for ps4 users plzzzzzz
Que seja lendario e Atemporal assim como O RE4 Original
J'ai fait l'original pour la première fois l'année dernière et franchement graphiquement il passe encore crème c'est juste les contrôles où tu sens que ça a vieilli. Vivement !
Dino Crisis Remake pls
جميل.
Как вы заебали делать ремейки блядь ,а когда уже начнут делать ремейки на ремейки ремейков???
Can't believe how fast views are coming for it in 1 day
they just replaced Ashley with Heather from Silent Hill.
0:31 NETFLIX?
Piensen un poco en los jugadores de playstation 4
hay papa no me imagino como sera vitores mendez salazar krauser y sadller con este remake ya mutados
We need code veronica remake
*gritando internamente*
UN FOLASTELO !!!
I can’t wait to see 4k Ashley goes LEON! HELPPPPPPPP!!!!
Please make it possible on ps4 😭😭🙏🙏
Надеюсь игра будет от третьего лица...  Очень крутая была игрушка на PS 2 в своë время! Одна из любимых моих игр.
Really again. Re4 the game that has been on every console since the gamecube. Can't wait to play this one on ps10 and the equivalent xbox. Nintendo will probably be another sega if they keep up with the gimmicks.
3d高清無碼
What're ya buyin
Hopefully we see regenerator at the next trailer
Bro look it the Red 9 He is holding 🔥
can't wait to hear "What are you buying stranger?" again
End with those days when the games are color brown but this time ashley wore red
Best of the best of best BESTTTT game I ever played 😍😍😍
@playstation don't be selfish put it on ps4 too because not all of us can afford ps5
I hope they have the dont shoot the water easter egg still
I am excited for the Regeneradores
Ashley is actually beautiful?????
I am so looking forward to this.
Hope it's scary like these games should be
Morir es vivir!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
Queremos dublado em BR
I hope it's longer than the new re2 and 3
I wonder if they can incorporate the ragdoll effects back into this like what they did in RE2, but then it will clash with the point earning system to upgrade weapons. I was extremely disappointed they removed it in RE3, felt like a huge downgrade.
Nothing about the island? And the Merchant? I'm a little bit worried.. Capcom don't ruin something that is already perfect. 😬
can't wait for praydog's vr mod
Awesomeee!!!
That's cool and all. But I'd rather that you remade code veronica X; the true resident evil 3 😁
дублёнка пропитка (8
the only game im excited for this year
Ah Classic 🦁🚬
Sony  por favor  faz  o jogo vim com dublagem  em Português  do Brasil. Este  jogo merece  😀😉. Vai vender  que nem  água  no verão. Aqui no Brasil 😍😍😍😍😍
an interesting game
Ashley: Reeeeeeeeeeon!!!
ada wongs outfit looks terrible
capcom make the game 30 hours plz thanks in advance
Censorship incoming
Wait its exclusive for ps5!?
PS4? 😢
NOSTALGIA 🇧🇷
Resident evil 8 part 2
Imagine the regenerators in this remake.
"20초부터 시작되는 음악이 기존 4편 초반부에 차타고 가는 내부라디오 음악인건 기분탓인가

Yesss💯
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.      !.!.!
Hóng
My best game ever! i hope that’s will come completely without any cuts. I hope also to see extra chapters, different puzzles and they put horror in the last chapters because in the old RE4 it turned to actions in the final of the game
I hope they remake the P.R.L 412 too
I 100% sure we don t get 20 hours gameply like orginal game and thay may delete some locations
Minha nossa ,😯
I can only see darkness throughout the whole video
finally
2005: brown 2023: blue
Por fin 🥺 ya se la fecha para ahorrar y comprarme una consola nueva para jugar re4
Add Arabic language please 😊

MIAWAUG
"You receive our sacred body" seems like tichy gren voice from Dark souls 2.
Yep me too.. And if they mess it up.. They are SCREWED!
Days gone 2
I am very disappointed re4 remake is not coming to ps4 please capcom bring it in on ps4
The new Ashley looked so cute, I wanna rescue her already 😂
Mi niñez está devuelta
الله يتسر
I might buy a PS5 just for this. Should I? 🤔  (Started gaming on Sega Genesis, Stopped gaming at Sony PS2)
Cant wait for the remake of this remake and its remake turbo edition in 10 years
I love the original zombie noises......"well in, well in, well in" so hope there's some more funny noises they make in the newer version.
неужели я дожил до этого момента
I hope this game brings RE 3.5 elements and an acuarate spanish 😁
Leonnnnnnnnn
Oh wow I legit thought this remake was just people seeing RE8 and thinking it was going to be a RE4 remake. Similar to the whole Pikablue situation.   That said from this commercial the game is almost unrecognizable. Hope they change the weapons a bit or add some new weapons in. Just hope this game delivers because people weren't sure about the idea of remaking RE4 since it's already looks close enough to the RE2 and RE3 remakes as oppose to what the original RE2 and RE3 were like. I'm still part of that camp that feels remaking Code Veronica would've been a better idea since that game desperately needs a remake and is so overlooked despite it's a pretty critical part of the RE lore. I just hope that Rebecca Chambers games I'm hearing about it something to look forward too.
If you guys mess this up your screwed! Lol
PS4 😢
In my opinion, Code: Veronica needs a remaking way more, rather than Resident Evil 4.
頼むから３みたいに糞にするなよカプコン
Now I will have to relive the nightmare of facing the Regenerator.
Where waiting for it I am so excited
After so many years, this game is my childhood definetly waiting to play it
Game coming for pc ps4???
Come here
why is he so young like in Part 2?
نتمنى وجود ترجمه
I'm always hoping they release the evil within 3 soon. Also it would be amazing if they do Dino crisis remake 1&2
I hope they will keep the Merchant
get rid of the island and make the village and castle longer and you have a masterpiece
🖤❤🖤❤🖤
Will be on ps4?? 🙏🙏
PS4 😭😭😭😭😭
i rlly hope
PS5 and PC for me. Gonna play this on the go with steam deck
Finally!!!!!#!###
It must be on ps4 too, the console is still exist you told us that you’re gonna support ps4 ‘till 2025 what a ridiculous is this
The game that got me into gaming all those years ago, it holds a very special place in my heart. Welcome back Leon.
Not hype though. After Vampires, what next? Drug Cartels? 😂
El foresterooo! 🤣
I wish they would remake Re 3.5
What I would love to see in this game is this one thing only…  Being able to see the light of the enemies torches approach you as one huge hoard from the distance.
สิ่งที่รอคอย
Hope its not as bad as the gta trilogy
برجع للتعليق هذا بعد سنوات و اقول لنفسي في المستقبل كيف قدرت تصبر 9 شهور على بال ماتنزل هاللعبه العظيمه !!
非常期待！！    Cool ！   >_<
It's gunna be sick
Yeah I keep my expectations in check with this one......
Садомазохизм очередной, с ароматами англосаксонского дерьма!
🔥
Finally!!!!! I was never more exited for a video game trailer... I hope Capcom won't disappoint us
Imagine regenerator would look like😳
Hate this game, it turn action and it's the end of survival style
Code Veronica ?
Can't wait for this beauty to come out, only 30 months for the 3rd of doubledecember 2023
YOOOO my fav resident game
Never played RE 4 but tbh I really hope that go with the horror element like in RE 7 because  these are the only horror games I can enjoy
Part 4 is the best for me.
Can't wait to destroy my X button to dodge those big rocks
ههههه ماهذه التمظرط
Wow!!
yes !!!!!! there is RE4 !!!!!!
ذكريات رزدنت ايفل 4
I will lower my standards and assume the whole game play was changed, so I don't get massively disappointed when it comes out.
The original RE4 was an epic it moved the Resident evil into AAA category and people still play it to this date.
I played it many times it was the only game in my box for 4 years until i got to know about San Andreas.
I have beaten the original game at least 100 times. Not exaggerating. At least 100 times. Still beating the game 2-3 times a year. Can’t get bored of it.
Ya man you got me
Thank You So Much for the Remake of this beauty, Can't Wait 🥺🥺
W końcuuuuu !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Kupie na xboxa
This is gonna be a masterpiece, but we all know Shinji Mikami's original game will be better than this, even if it's graphics are out-dated.
오우야 잔인한 마을 나오던 4편이 리메이크 되는건가 기대되네~
This nostalgia hits hard! I really hope they release this for the PS4 as well...it only makes sense because they released RE2 & RE3 remake for it. 🙏🙏🙏
Моя любимая часть. Но похоже нам её не видать
Pss... enseñar esto y nada es lo mismo y con 10 meses de antelación.  Humo.
Hopefully the dog will be playable too
Welcome, what you buyin? hahah thank you
I’m excited less for the game but the amount of hate speech the fans will throw at the creators
Finally !!!!! Resident Evil's masterpiece get the royal treatment , i knew they were going to do it. Time to hear her say one more time : " You are a pervert " :-) 🙂
i am so ready
another remake?
The new Ashley model is the Dutch beauty Ella Freya.
Is it coming out on PS4?
Big risk
can we still flash bang the bird|??
Leon handsome 😀😀😀
HYPED!
They should’ve done Code: Veronica instead.
I don’t get it. Why are they trying to remake perfection?
В этот момент пукан Русяева взорвался. Ведь "КО-КО-КО РЕЗИДЕНТ 4 ПЛОХАЯ ИГРА КО-КО-КО"
El mejor residet evil en lo personal
"muere, muere, muere, muere...:"
Still remember those enemies you had to shoot with the thermosight at the leeches inside. Was so terrified that I couldn't even aim anymore
when ı wacth, wait that sound in some where "what are you buying" :D
❤
it did not work. Its not letting me play GTA Online. I don't understand. Why it keeps saying could not load from cloud servers
Meh. I had hope for Dino Crisis Remake...
1:28 ADA WONG IS BACK
My favorite game ever
I’ll never forget ever
PLEASE... Don't Be Like RE 3 Remake 🔥🔥🔥
Too bad the voice actors are different. Saddler and Salazar's voices are unique.
The Best RE
"Ahhh! I'll buy it at a high price!"
looks like the took the resident evil village platform and modify it and replace the character model....and some tweaking...lets see how in the end how much difference this game and village
no ps4?😔
POR FAVOR QUE NO RECORTEN ESCENARIOS NI ENEMIGOS, CREO QUE CAPCOM YA APRENDIÓ DEL ERROR QUE HIZO EN RE3 REMAKE. QUE ÉSTE, SU MEJOR JUEGO, NO VAYA A COMETER EL MISMO ERROR.
Now i can face my fear of the chainsaw guy in the highest definition to date!!!
Looks like Leon’s going to rescue a young Jodie Foster😅
Ashley no longer looks like an chimpanzee and I hope she's still equipped with ballistic missiles.
Not enough remakes! Stranger!
The important Quistion is Is it going to be better than the original game I have 34   years old I played it in February 2005 with my Playstation 2 at that time I don't think it's going to be  better than before
Ps4
I knew there was going to be a RE version of 4. Yet when I saw the trailer, it still gave me goosebumps.
I hope the zombies still saying araaarerooo

Capcom don't you dare make this another expansion of RE2 remake
Is it coming for 8th generation?
porq ps5 y no ps4 :(🤧
A wait is over...
i wonder how would the developer handle the decapitation scene / death scene
I will buy PS5 just to play this masterpiece 😍😍😍 been waiting for this since a long time its like A DREAM CAME TRUE!!! Thank you capcom!!! ❤️
Hello stranger! what are you buying?!🧙  Aaahhhh excellent choice! Hehehe🧙…
it looks insane
If "The Merchant" is not in this game, I will not buy.
would be nice if the fkn reverse dlc that came with re8 would come out less than 2 years after re8 was released
Better have the real mercenaries mode not that garbage from the village.
Trust Gods to resident evil t shirt you !!!! 👽👽👽👽👽👽📎🌍
Just Like before me and several people think RE 4 doesn't need a remake, but let us see this one. Waiting....
😊ada di PS4 tidak ya nanti nya?
Resident Evil 4 Remake
Please do not cut anything 🙏🏼
nice
I remember back when re3 remake came out and i was like, i hope they remake re4, my dreams have come true
Best game ever made by RE series
有沒有阿姨很大
If krauser is in this game I hope he's not difficult like he was in the original
Y ahora resulta que cada juego de ps saldrá solo para ps5.
Imagina reviver o terror que era ouvir o Regenerator, Salvador pqp kkkkkkkk
Hue
Resident evil village remake haha
Please let this be just like the original. If it isn't 3rd person with a lot of melee options for combat I'm going to be thoroughly disappointed.
Ansioso pracas com esse jogo!
As soon as this game is released, Capcom had better get started on a Code Veronica remake.
Ashley Glowing up & atmosphere is feeling darkness
Hello friend 😉Big Like 👍👍👍 안녕하세요. 응원합니다. 좋네요.👍
Who still can't buy a PS5?! lol. 💯
Resident Evil 5 Remake Please!
They make the creepiest environments!  Im getting this lol
Okay. But they better remake Resident Evil 5 too. I want some more HD Chris.
Yeah!!!
releasing on my birthday😍
متحمسين ❤️‍🔥😂
Aff não dá pra ver nada nessa porra
Just don't redo 5 please gawd lol
Ada not wearing dress in this remake 🤔
great!!! but where is Code Veronica? that game came before this one, i really hope they don't forget about that amazing game!! Regards from one of the bigest fan of the saga
Gee what's next? RE5 and RE6 gonna be remastered?! This is just plain stupid! I get it remastering 2 and 3 but 4, 5, and 6 are perfect the way they are!!
For all the people watching this video who you got Chris or Leon ?? But resident evil never really been trash so looking forward to it gotta entertain the fans🔥
Just so everyone knows this part is where I believe Leon is looking at the other officers body on the bbq in the beginning (NOT the big cheese boss fight ) 1:17
What about Resident Evil Code Veronica Remake??
空耳がまた聞けるのか
Wow this will be like the 5th remake/remastered for re4, whats next re1 remake for some lousy upgraded graphics?
Re
Let's hope a certain * someone * is as annoying this time around lol.   Wonder what all they going to change here.
I am very excited! thanks to play station 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😙😙😙😚😚😚
Map? Spain Voices? Mexicans Hotel? Trivago
Berleezy can’t play this game if he doesn’t beat Resident Evil 2 remake before 2023.
I wanted code Veronica before this.
Creo que en este remake cambien los acentos de los pueblerinos
CAPCOM! Code Veronica plssssss
The dream has come true 🎁🎊
Ashley is CUTE!?  They better not censor out all the dialogue like they did with the RE4 VR release.  EYES ON YOU, CAPCOM.
Leon is the best player
It has that vibe of RE7, where all the happiness started. oh man.. Ada ♥
I just really hope the villagers to be white and not poor and speak like Catalans or Spaniards at least (being the game located in Spanish Pyrenees), and not like Mexicans, please!
WELCOME!
Ps4 ?
see   ada in those costume    ok    take my money    lol
Best game ever
Here's hoping it sticks to the original as much as possible. From the whole atmosphere of the game to the part where we control Ashley in the castle.
I'm so hyped for this, resident evil 4 was and is still one of my favorite games 💗
They could've made Leon a bit older then his re2 baby face nonetheless I'm hyped
"LEON HELP!" with RTX ON
Meu Deus QUE HOMEMMMMM 😍
Voy a extrañar el actor de voz de leon matthew mercer, ojalá sea buen remake para que compense 😢
No lo jodan como la basura de remake barato que hicieron de RE3
Poor Ashley
CAPCOM: "I've got something that might interest ya! hehehehe." THE FANS: "Un Forastero!!!" ALSO THE FANS: "Been a long time , comrade!"
TPS is best
I think that iniciated ace combat zero
24 del marzo del 2023 las filas para comprar el vídeo juego Resident Evil 4 remake están largas  😂😂😂 como sera el día bueno a esperar
anyone knows what's the title for guitar song in the opening? it's kind of a flamingo or some sort yeah,  so cool
Gritos de perra loca en 3 2 1 AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😃😃😃😃😃😃😃🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
FJB!!!!!
Resi 4 is still really playable so I don't get why it needs  a remake, Code Veronica would benefit far more from the remake treatment.
I truly hope that this doesn't turn out like resident evil 3 remake
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH QUE LOCURA
No Code Veronica then?
My childhood game with my homies those days :)
Does anyone know if the music at the start is original, or already has a full release and title?
炒冷飯巨作
the thing i don't understand is why code veronica has not being released as a remake when resident 4 is after code veronica
🇧🇷😍😍😍😍🥵
Canadian Carlos? My maple syrup isn't ready!!!!!!!!
Will enemies fly from a high kick like in original game? If yes then with modern graphics its gonna be hilarious 😂 But if it's made smooth, would be also cool, because hand combat animations in Remakes of 2 and 3 are basically usage of knife
TEM QUE TER UMA VERSÃO PRO PS4!!!
Hopefully Ashley will be less annoying in this game than she was in the original.
Vocês tem que lança esse jogo pra PS4!!! O remake mais aguardado não vão lança??? Sério???? Tem que lança PS4!!!
0:53 but why does she have the stupid anime girl run?
Fãs do mundo inteiro aguardam ansiosamente por esse jogo 🎮❤
didnt know the year had 24 months
Ojalá no cambien muchas cosas pero tiene muy buena pinta el juego
Please make this game for PS4 also, I beg you
The uncontrolled, ungoverned use of thought and feeling has brought about all kinds of discord, sickness and distress. Few, however, believe this, and keep going on and on continually creating by their ungoverned thought and desire, chaos in their worlds; when they could as easily as a breath face about, using their thought constructively with the motive power of divine love, and build for themselves a perfect paradise within the period of two years.
Me acabo de venir
I wish they had the original voice actors though....it really makes a big difference
يا زينهم الملزلزين جيش ملزلز🫡
LEON HALP
I hope melee moves are as fun as in original.
I have just one word:  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Where's everyone going, Bingo?
1:17 Isn't that the luis sera's voice?
Oh no I have to rescue Ashley again, this time in HD with next gen graphics.
🥺🥺🥺
Tá bonito demais, eu vejo algumas alterações que podem ser boas na game play, o principal é muito bom ver um jogo que mudou a sua geração volta com os gráficos lindos acho que não tem momento melhor para o retorno desse jogo, a Capcom nunca esteve tão preparada para fazer um jogo como esse, domara que erros do RE3 sirvam de experiência para esse. tentando segurar o hype
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
super gorde amige
4 is my least favorite but it's still a great game.
it's not on ps4 so i do not care will not be buying
tomara que dublem, a fã dublagem que fizeram já é muito boa, mas um dublagem oficial seria massa
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

will the remake come to pc aswell, rather buy it on pc then to buy 600+ ps5 .....no wait a 1000+ ps5
This better have a COUCH CO-OP MERCENARY MODE!
After what they did to RE3 Remake, i'm not being catfished again. I'm coming with very low expectations.
Oh no did you get brand new voice actors …. I was hoping that we get the original guys again
Hahaha once again masterpiece is coming...lets play🎮🔥childhood memories...🥺just i am going to buy ps5 for this game...
I know it's the same voice actor from the RE2 remake, but his voice pitch is way too high in this trailer, should be lower like the original, since he's definitely supposedly older on the timeline isn't?, that voice isn't suitable at all.., like a teenager 😒😒😒
Ps4???
I know it’s a remake but i’m hoping this one is more true to the original and expanded upon
Okay It's Game Time
Im all in love the franchise 🤟💀
Does anyone know name of the song in the intro? Its amazing i need it
So excited, resident evil 4 is on my top 3 favorites of all time.
Please bring back cooperative mercenaries mode.
Finally
Please!!! Verónica deserves a remake too!!
Who cant wait to save Ashley again and again and again?
Wow it will a masterpiece 👏👏👏👏
Gostinho de infância voltando com tudo 😊
Maybe I'm being a bit nit picky here but Leon's clothes look a bit off, especially the pants, it's as if his clothes are too big on him.
Sick
I need to see a cuter ashley graham for mod :) and scarier regenerator. Hope they're not ruin this
LEON HEEEEEELP!
Can't wait to see the Verdugo in this reboot!
I played this multiple times on the GameCube and now can't wait for this one
But will this one get an iPod port, as well? :o
pietro lombadi
Please don't cut content..!
буду ждать прохождения Куплинова
Am I crazy or did certain scenes in this trailer look like "the village" from RE8?
They Better Use The Same Voice Actors As The Original 2005, Especially Leon's!
LEEEEEEOOOOOOONNNN
Morir es Vivir
This game is generating way more views, likes and attention than the new FF16 lol. The power of RE4
I'LL BUY IT IN A HIGH PRICE!!!
umarım berbat etmezsiniz...
Cade os BR???
выглядит как игра на движке юнити
Eu vendo esse video e lembrando q sou pobre e nao vou ter como jogar 🤡
Wow 🤩
They butchered RE4 VR already, can't wait to see the interviews filled with excuses why they had to censor this one too.
Now i wait For Resident Evil 5
MEU PAI AMADO🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
The only RE I've ever beaten because I had a GameCube... Awesome game!
Please add the melee attack  variation not just kick and suplex😉😉
No ps4 version?
Can we also expect Resident Evil 5 remake? 🤔🤔🤔
Oh come on admit it! You waited for a chainsaw sound!!!
i hope a "full game content" remake. RE3R was a shame
hello stranger...   what are you buying?...   what are you selling?...
Is that all, stranger?  Heh heh heh... Thank you!
I'm nervous about a remake one of the greatest games of all time 😬
Is there a full version of this spanish song at the beginning?
One of the few games I’ve played through in one sitting. The gameplay & atmosphere were amazing!  Bought it for the GameCube when it came out in the afternoon, played till 2 or 3 in the morning & wanted to play the rest the next day. Went to bed for 30 minutes, couldn’t sleep & started the game again to finish it around 5 or 6 o’clock. One of the best gaming experiences ever! :)
The graphics are so cool, so beautiful❤️🇧🇷
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa mipichula
YEEEEES !!!!
Why is the date wrong? There aren't 24 months.
Is that all stranger?! Hehe thank you 😉 ahhhh this is hype af can't wait to replay this masterpiece!!!!
Hope they will put it on ps4
Luis my beloved
The Best Resident Evil Ever!!! ❤
Digan lo que quieran :) Pero se saltaron Code Veronica y no se me olvida.
Thanks to Capcom for the fact that we (Russians) will not be able to play it!  Games outside of politics?
Can’t wait to get that fully upgraded Red 9.
Cómo te decía, Ashley siempre me agrado.
Oafff
Am i The only one who’d like RE 1 remake in style of RE 2 and 3 ?  Considering that RE 4 is getting remake treatment of 2 and 3
HOPE THEY KEEP SOME OF THE CAMPY ELEMENTS OF THE ORIGINAL
Espero que todo este igual que el original, tambien que pongan algo nuevo verdad pero que se respete todo lo anterior y que no pase lo mismo que paso con el remake del 3 jaja :((
*TÁ DIFÍCIL CRESCER NO YOUTUBE, MAS NÃO VOU DESISTIR DO MEU SONHO!!! ❤🙏🏼 🍃😃*
Я люблю пивоооооооооо
Need on pc
Onde é que aperta pra ir pra 2023 logo???   Com toda certeza estarei com meu PS5 até lá. 😎🔥
The original is the best resident evil game along with resi evil 2 original. Now they've remade it I hope it doesn't disappoint! The re2 remake was great I hope this can live up to it too.
SOLO SE VA A PODER JUGAR EN PS5? me muero
Какая хорошая игрушка была! Лучшая из всей серии. Но у меня подозрения, что и её переиздание испортят.
Here we go again. I have cube game. I had fighting with infection.
Ахуеть!
The onIy thing l need to know about this remake is: Does you're right hand come off?
Show us Ashley's big ears you cowards!
This time I will not fall for Capcom's bs, RE3 Remake was a disgrace that changed Jill from one of my favorite characters to a whiny Karen and RE4 VR was censored trash. I'm certain the RE4 VR censorship will be brought over for this demake.
I’m so happy 🥺🥺🥺
I sure hope Sony releases more PS5s if this doesn’t get a PS4 port.
When Code Veronica?
TAAA TIRANDO,  RE4 ATÉ Q ENFIM   POAAA
Song name?
I'm so glad I never finished this game.  Few months back I quit and hoped they'd remake this.
Can't wait to get decapitated a million times by the chainsaw guy...
Ждём годноты
Another re4 game that I have to buy 😳😳. I just recently finished it on oculus ffs
Perfect 🔥🙏🏻🎮
Só tenho uma coisa a dizer LEON HELPPPPPPPPP!
chills
YES FINALY !!!
I'm really happy for the Re4 Remake I didn't expect this. how great 🙏
Honestly, I hope they do it like re2 and 3, I'm really enjoying the over the shoulder style
Still can’t believe this!!!!!! CAPCOM THANK YOU
i hope there are plenty of new monsters and not reusing old ones again.
Screaming, crying, but most importantly, sighing.
nope
Can't wait to hear "Detrás de ti, imbécil" again.
Krlhoo nem fudendo
So hype!!
Incoming "This game will be the second coming of Christ" comments from sycophantic fanboys who never stfu about anything
je suis si heureux d'y n'avoir jamais jouer, je vais découvrir ce chef d'oeuvre incha'Allah en 2023
Song?
Blue is the new Brown
I'd love to see Luis and the Merchant playable in the Mercenaries this time around.
スッキ
The Remake that nobody ask for to one of the best games ever made. It looks gorgeous. I just hope that they haven't done a Resi 3 Remake on it and ruined it by stripping out sections of this lengthy entry in the series.
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos~ 🟥
i literally want to cry tears of joy right now
It’s time for another Resident Evil game , oof .
Hope that they will still include the Mercenaries mode compared to RE3 Remake that Mercenaries is not included.
?Ahi esta!
@Capcom you guys should do  code veronika
2:05 great rocks texture resolution :D
Campaign : $70 Separate ways :  $30 Assignment: ada : $30 Mercenaries : $20
A dream 😍😍😍
Considering I just went back and beat RE4 again after my 208384827th time, finally I’ll have the remake to play over and over again 😂😂
Meu sonho se tornou realidade!!! Não me decepcione Capcom
I attempted to play the original remake for the PS4 after playing the 2 and 3 remakes. I couldn't get through it. I'm hoping this does the original justice so I miss no sequences unlike 3.
RIP Code Veronica 😭
I either need every goofy scene from the original intact, or they make this even goofier MGS Twin Snakes style
AWESOME cant wait for resident evil 8 remake!!
Im happy but sad at the same time because no Code Veronica remake 😔
I love how capcom found their formula in remaking games that they've already done. lol
LETS GOO
People are still waiting for their PS5 though...............
Why did they skip Code Veronica ? 😞
Lyon～～～～～～～～
Leon!
Xbox one e Ps4???
Great, now ima have to do a resident evil marathon tonight
Potato station
Why ps5 only?....ps4 please..
I hope to all mighty ilah. You will find yourself in jahannam along with your rest of your Satans family members. It's game over.
Solo falta el 5
They better keep the cheesiness
Espero que los ganados tengan voz con accento espanol esta vez y no mexicano y que usen las lineas iconicas originales que decian jajaja sino van a estropear lo estupendo que fue.....me encanta mucha la linea "detras de ti imbecil" jajajaj....
EITCHA PORRRAA
Can someone PLEASE tell me the name of the song?
YESSSSS
It's been a long time, Stranger.
Hope they fix the lighting and make it brighter. And make Ada Wong hotter.
Wonder what krauser mission would look  like
Gonna be PC too
amazing, ramake of the best resident ever. how does it feel to play such awesomeness on a current console😢❤️❤️
I mean why not? re4 is their best in the series
But re3 remake was trash T_T why
Bruh stop doing remake please release some new resident evil with new storylines
Great! But looks like Leon sliding on the ground...
Capcom, I want this. But I want Luis and Ashley more.
Morir es Vivir
I really hope they kept the "Help me Leon!" and "LEOOOON! HEEEEELP!" voicelines
On the RE engine? Wow this is amazing leave all the corny stuff and give me 4k graphics... Ashley thou ehhhh on the fence
I'm just gonna wait for all the games to be remastered, so I can play them all. I've only played 5 and 6.
Enough of remakes, game developers! Come up with something new, for a change!
Un forastero. !
The game that kept the series alive is finally getting remade! Awesome!  and a throwback that This used to be my most played game on the PS2. beat the game many times.
This can’t get here soon enough. So excited!
Wait so is Ashley’s model Ella Freya? I can kinda see the resemblance
Наконец то! Ееееебать копать
Ashley be looking bad tho.
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTT???
アシュリーの写真、ちょっと、どうかな、原作より可愛くないような…、別人になってしまってるような、リメイクでアシュリーは重要なキャラ、４はアシュリーの可愛さも重要な魅力の１つであるから、アシュリーが原作以上になるかどうかで評価は変わる、「アシュリー可愛くない」とか「アシュリーは原作の方が良かった」と言われると、他は良くても評価下がる、「他は凄く良いリメイクなのに、アシュリーが残念」というは、不味い、 ４ではエイダ以上にアシュリーはマドンナ的存在やからな、 リメイクで、アシュリーの可愛さアップは必須やと思う、  アシュリーの胸の揺れの表現も大事だね、上手く揺れれば、「揺れがたまらん」と話題にもなるし、アシュリーをどこまで表現するかも重要になってくる、決して原作と大差ないリメイクしてはいけないキャラやと思う。
No saldrá para ps4?
Infância revivida com sucesso.
YAY NEW GAMES THANKS SONY
DONT FIX THINGS THAT ARENT BROKEN! YOU'LL JUST FCK IT UP REALTIME!
RE:3 Remake was pretty terrible...so IDK about this..RE:2 Remake was great tho
Finalmente um remake!
Okey... The little cabin of the beginning looks wey creepy surrounded by those trees
yes yes yes!!!!!!
I hope capcom didnt rush to make this one. RE4 is the best of all installments and people need this remake to live up to its original. RE2 remake was the best but RE3 remake and Re8 is enough for me to be a bit sceptical on the future franchise
I cannot wait for this! IM HYPED
My fav RE in whole series. I'm hyped!
Help me, Leon!
Take my money 🤑
"Hello stranger..."
The Leon model looks odd. Think it's the bottom of his trousers, but I can't quite put my finger on it. Hopefully the game is better than the 3 remake. Resi 4 was a long game so be interesting to see if "reimagining" translates to a much shorter game like the 3 remake ended up being.
Esse será o grande jogo do século. É muito emocionante ver o remake de um grande jogo que  marcou não só minha infância, mas , de muitas outras pessoas em todo o mundo.
Llevo esperando AÑOS a que esto sucediese... PFFF
How many copies of this game are gonna be made? Just leave it alone already.
Is 5 next to be remade
Leeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeon!
I always play this game up until I meet Ashley and then get tired of it.
pls dont fk it up
FINALLY.
AAAAAA
CAN’T WAIT
.اخيراً
Leon!! Help!!!
What if RESIDENT EVIL 5 was REMAKED soon?
With that ending, I believe they understood that RE3 Remake was horrible and this one is going to be an amazing and unforgettable remake.
Ni modo, otro motivo para vivir.
Please we can play as louis serra
*grito de fan en modo chica* vivire para ver esta belleza ufff <3
Definitely getting the collectors edition for the chainsaw ps5 controller
Buen y hermoso trabajo Capcom, podrían lanzar este trabajo también para ps4    para todos sus fanáticos. 😁
Até que fim pouha
Excited for this!
ОАОАОАОАОАОАОАОАООАОАОАОАО!!!!!! КАК ЕЩЁ МНЕ ОПИСАТЬ СТЕПЕНЬ СВОЕГО СЧАСТЬЯ!?😀
I've probably played re4 over 400 times and still never get bored playing it...
If i can't obtain the Chicago typewriter I'm gonna riot.
A remake is equal to reviving thousands of memories 🌄✨✨✨🌈👑🌌
I love Playstation please do not stop be the best Sony ;)
Many thanks to Sony for Resident Evil 4🆒♥️♥️♥️
Konami what are you doing? Where are the silent hill games ramked
Very sad it is a ps5 exclusive game
YES LOVE IT This game has had its own players for more than twenty years, so keep paying attention, and bring us new part as well.
Thank you for making this it was needed I hope it is at least true to the content of the original.
The replay value for this game is ridiculously high. Glad this was created before the microtransaction era
Can't wait to see how they have made Salazar and Saddler and hope they still have the awesome weapons like the mine thrower and the handcannon and of course The Merchant!!!! - "he he he he thank you" 😂
4 was always my fav
You're just as beautiful as the day I left you
Va ser exclusivo solo para ps5? Me voy a matar si es a si
looks awesome, though i hope they manage to find a way to keep/modernize the comedic undertone of the original game. That's an important piece of puzzle that made the original game such a timeless masterpiece
Lets hope that they don't bungle this like they did Nemesis!
¡¡¡Este es un momento histórico para los jugadores de videojuegos y los fans de Resident Evil!!!
I never get to finish this game , this is a big chance for me
Hoping that this game doesn't have an Ashley yelling "Leon!!! Leonnnn!!!" 😂
One of the greatest games ever created. So nostalgic
Her new hairstyle is crinnnngy XD I'm not even a fan of the new environment buildings they look like fatal frame rip offs using the poor quality lighting from re2 remake.
WHAT ARE YA SELLIN
Que bien ha envejecido Resident Evil 4 con el pasar de los años.
i bought RE2 remake so i would get a RE3 remake, RE3 was a short game and somehow the remake was even shorter, skipping all puzzles and even entire levels. what a spit in the face.... i never liked RE4 as it felt more like a metal gear game then a RE game. im gonna skip this one just like they skipped Code Veronica(tho it would probably of been as half assed as RE3 was)
Did you send out those invitations? I told you no more than 50 people!
I kind of wish we got a Code Veronica Remake instead since I can go back and play 4 just fine on just about any console on the market. Still I am looking forward to an improved version assuming this turns out more like REmake 2 and less like REmake 3.
Пушка
Hey aca!!!(welcome stranger).
🔥😍
Can't wait to see speed runner 👍
No wayyy brooooooo😭😭😭
We have to wait almost a year for the release I can’t wait.
It’s going to be a long wait but I’m going to be so excited to play this, the original was just amazing
🎵Morir es vivir. Morir es vivir. Cógedlo, cógedlo, cógedlo... Muere, muere, muere....🎵 Welcome back the the real Village.
Will it come out for PS4?
Que saquen el 1 y el 0 en remake. Ya jugamos mucho el 4  . Yo creo que el 1 y el 0 pueden ser muy buenos como los remakes del 2 y el 3
Agárrenlo!!
I hope there’s an Infinite Ammo on this Game
but the real question is: can we still flashbang crows?
Best resident evil ever, all the weapons and upgrades and i still felt scared to go around a corner. It was perfect. I want  to see it with awesome updated graphics and everything and if they could add some new stuff that fits into the game, then that would be awesome. I always wanted to play through whole game again with ada wong!!
RE4 keeps following me! Started on PS2 then gamecube, xbox360,PS4 and nintendo switch. I just cant stop playing
Wow so realy wow yes i love it now !!!✌️❤️👍🎮🎮🎮🌞🌞🌞🕹🕹🕹🤒🤒🤒
It's not the same voice actor is it?
Release Number 120
Capcom has my respect
Can't wait to see them regenerators. 🥹
Best game in PS2
Оооооо даа!))))
Um forasteiro!
Miralo esta herido, ojala no le quiten las frases originales xD
The graphics and gameplay look like a ps4 game very disappointing. Capcom should have released a longer dlc on RE8 thats where the standard is in terms of graphics and gameplay
😢😢😢
MORIR ES VIVIR MORIR ES VIVIR
Merchant: "What're ya buying"?  Me: This game!!!
Sweet!!! Now we can try to look up Ashley's skirt in 4k now 😃
ojalá y no borren a salazar, krauser ni a del lago
Favorite horror game Resident Evil 4 😌👍😀👏
brabo
Se os Regeneratores ja deram medo no Ps2, imagine agr como serão ????
As a game designer, I can say that this game shaped my history and the way I think about games. Could play every day and I would never be bored. Can't wait to play this reboot, especially the village sequence. The best RE ever, for sure.
as someone who grew up playing RE1 - 4 as a kid. RE4 Classic is trash i welcome REMAKE4. Now lets get some CODE VERONICA REMAKE capcom!!!
It won't be released in PS4 :'(((((((((
LEONNN HEEEELPPP
Now we get to see the merchant in his glorious 4K life form
*"This time (REmake 4 hopefully being horror) it can be different (Action-oriented Original RE4) It has too.*  *- Leon S. Kennedy.*
The one that ruined the franchise.
Caralhoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo hahahhha
Nostalgia 😊 Please don't delay the game 👍🏻
RE4 is my favorite game of all time and I'm so excited for Psvr2 and Resident evil 4 remake.
Would love to see how Krauser and all bosses will look in this game. All new content is welcome and would love to see Albert little cameo, but nothing should be cut from the original game. I wanted complete original game with additional content and love that it's coming in Psvr2.
Se ficar igual a bosta do 3, nem continua...
Not feeling it. RE4 was about being a buddy cop movie and 80s one-liners.
un forastero! en 4k
The chainsaw guys are gonna make me terrified again just when I was young playing this game on ps2.
Welcome Stranger
yessssss!!!👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
I'm hoping for some new content involving Ashley and Luis.
Aha! I will buy it at a high price.
this is why i love sony so much !!!!!!
Look great! Next has to be Code Veronica! ;)
CADE OS BR QUE AMA RESIDENT EVIL 4 ?
Que bonita se ve Ashley
They already did a vr port they also needed a remake
thank you capcom!
The original game still looks great to me. I'm glad that new players will be able to experience the game though, since it is a bit archaic in its gameplay.
Like a boss
I hope I can get a PS5 til then....
This is called "An unbelievable Game", 🎉🎉🎉👍
Love this game playing at night😍
wow its only going to release for Ps5? i hope xbox buys out the rest of theor franchises.
Ashley looks cute. They'll probably downgrade her "ballistics" though.
Let's goooooooo
Why ps 5😭,
Ya se acabaron las ideas en el gaming ahora solo hay battle royale y remakes no más
Let's make this trending
It’s a beautiful
Next Gen starts here!
Ok, I don't want new RE4 anymore.
re 5 remake please
See rockstar? This is how you bring back memories
❤
Sou Nutelinha , só jogo se for dublado Kiridinha :x
5 фрс мне уже обеспечено )
will the game have Polish subtitles?
Forasteiro!!!
wow este resident evil es maravilloso , no veo la hora de jugar este remake .
Man i hope they keep Leon corny and bold like the og RE4, the game was cheesy at times but it had a certain charm to it.
Can't wait to see regenerator's design at this remake 🤯🤯
What??? is this real????
We played Village. And we play Village again.
Hands down are favorite Resident Evil game of all time!
INFANCIA PURA
I never played the original so i’m definitely excited about this!!
Morir es vivir
Nossa a trilha sonora esta incrível, gráficos muito bons, espero que eles mantenham o que ja tem e apenas incluam mais cenários, conteudos e personagens!!!
OOOOHHH ME VENGOOOOO!!!!

"Monsters.. guess after this there'll be one less to worry about"  Something tells me there won't be that kind of smack talking from our hero in this RE
My very very favorite games of all time.
Im in love
I like 😍so much for this game but releasing Re4 game ps5 platform only because I don't have ps5 I have ps4 so I want this game for ps4 platform
LEON
anjir game RE terlegend remake juga official jg
AL FIN!!!!
🤩🤩
2:04 I thought I saw the merchant man 😔
Looks like they're adding content rather than cutting it this time! Cannot wait!!
Unbelievable it's coming
Calling it now that they aren't going to do this game justice. It's simply too big, too large of an undertaking to need like 3-5 years.
This is a huge gamble for Capcom , it can be either RE2 Remake which surpass the og or another RE3 Remake which isn't a bad game but didn't live up to the og. Either way I'm still hyped for this....
･:*+.\(( °ω° ))/.:+
PUNFORA ESTELO!!
And Resident Evil Code Veronica? 🤕😭
УРААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААА
leeeonnnnnn hellllpp
I am soooo hyped guys this and next year so many dope Horrorgames yessss Sir
If they don't keep the length and most of this game as it was before then I vote to sign a petition for them to re-release it in that state! This is by far the most iconic game in the series, if they don't keep everything how it was just improved they will have a fan uprising no doubt! lol
No one asked for this...
I can’t wait to play it
Here we go Bois! Back to where all the hype truly started 😎
VEM CARALHO!!!!
Oh come on dear Capcom,bring it for PS4 too... easily could be handle it🤔🙏😎
MORIR ES VIVIR!
I hope it comes with Separate Ways as the original..
What happened to resident evil reverse
Espero que ahora sí los aldeanos españoles hablen español
I am already pump for it ..one of the biggest successful games with Leon in residential franchise
Que emoción!!! No puedo esperar
Esto es real😱😱😱😱😱???
I’ll buy this for sure. I’m also joining the vr bandwagon this time. Just give me half life Alex as well Sony!
Over here, stranger!
gracias capcom
Con tal de que no sea otro bodrio como el remake de RE3
Really that far away . Can we stop With this sand just release Things and not tell us a year ahead of time
Me as PS4 player 😭..
Resident evil 4 remake I'm glad it's being made but until I get my hands on a PS5 all I can do is only watch other's play it. If can I get one by next year. If not watching is all I can do.
This looks like a 1:1 remake and I'm okay with that.
Yo Estuve Allí, Fui Parte De La Historia, Jugué Esto Con 8 Años, Ahora Con 26 Jugare Está Pieza Maestra
Just don't change the voices please of the zombie. and don't go woke here too
44444
they hear about what we want and thats nice
Ashley is beautiful - that's it, I have to play.
Resident Evil 4 was the best from the series that I ever played. Hopefully this second rebort is better than the trash HD remake that came out a few years ago 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Jurenme que esto es real por dios
One of the best games , it needed a remake Let’s goooooooooo🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
If it’s not ps4 compatible I can tell you where to insert disc other than the ps5
I hope this is not too much expensive to buy. This game is the reason I have become a fan of the resident evil series.
only gotta do 1 and code veronica and have a fully modernise resident evil franchise
is this game available on playstation 4 ?
i hope my 1650 can run this game 😔
It better be souly like the original... or else I'll be sad.
I'm really looking forward to this but I was hoping for a Code Veronica remake 😕
Incrível 😍
Неужели
Господи! Я уж было испугался что это адаптация от нетфликс!
LEON.... HELP....HELP ME LEON!
PONI LEMPAR BERAKSI DI DESPACITO LAGI BOIS!!!!!!!!!!111
Just thinking that after this there is only the remake left for code Veronica, it gives me goosebumps
I’m sick of this medieval setting that is butchered in video games. ‘Village’ was such a let down where Capcom should have kept it city wise and in third person — RE2 was perfect
Yaaaaaaasssssss been waiting for this one since they have remade all the others up to this. 😁👍
My fav game love it
I hope they keep improving the graphics to the new gen consoles and graphic cards, because THIS doesn´t look still like a ps5 game. Im pretty sure that a ps4 pro could do the work still.
Only for PS5 ?
Resident Evil 4 REMAKE should include Krauzer, The Mercenaries and either Separate Ways or Assignment Ada, as well as some of the extra weapons, such as the Chicago Typewriter.  In addition to that, they should consider:  Operation Javier as a DLC expansion. Making a Code Veronica Remake.
Can't imagine a world without RE!
let's just hope that Costello finally gets his food and we met our friendly second amendment connoisseur
The original Resident Evil 4 is a grand achievement..... STILL sells. I don't know how hard they worked on this game, but I'll wait for the reviews.....but my review counts the most
El principio es extremadamente épico con el paso doble, las castañuelas y la guitarra española.
КАК ФАНАТ ИВЕЛОВ Я ЛИКУЮ
It would be cool if they tried to do what the prototype RE4 tried to do, with the fixed camera angles, that allow over the shoulder aiming. for combat. I think the best thing this game can do is really sell the creepy woods feel and atmosphere, in order to differentiate it from the original.
BEST GAME EVER CREATED
No pre-order stranger!
そんなことより、アウトブレイクまだ？PS2のグラフィックでストーリーもそのままでいいから、待ってます！
The best RE!
Cool 🙂
Leon!!!
This is one of those remakes I've been waiting for. Along with Silent hill and the parasite eve series
Wow amazing  So excited for this Remake Game
Welcome back “STRANGER” ❤🔥🔥
Please don’t change anything beside better mechanics and new graphics. Other than that is a big no, don’t make it shorter or delete any character.
Resident Evil 4❤️‍🔥♥️
LEON! HEELLLPPP!!   Now in HD.
Arată chiar bine.
get ready for the whole new generation of "help me LEON!"
illo que me da un infartooooooooooooooooooooooo <3<3<3<3<3
Why don’t you stop remaking great games purely for profit, and come up with something new and original?
Can't wait to hear spaniards speaking latin american spanish in 4k
жду в день релиза в пс плюсе)) или ни как прдругому ...
damnit i cant wait...
Remake?
look forward to !!!
the fact that they skipped over code veronica kinda makes me sad but can’t wait to see what happens next
I’m about to finish this in vr and now there’s a remake, dream come true
So excited ❤❤❤💎
Will it only come out for ps5?
No chainsaw guy 0/10
It doesn’t need a remake
No lo van a sacar para ps4? Apesta la mercadotecnia :c
О даааа я дождался этого :))))
Is it just me or does Luis Sera already sound Canadian?   “Wrong place to vacation, eh?”
Fix the PSN
Cant wait fot this but why Leon looks fat? his jacket is too big
Time to find Ashley again...
The legend is back
Iam happy about this but i really hoped for Code veronica :)
I hope my boy the merchant makes a return
Espero que a CAPCOM não estrague essa obra prima. Minha nostalgia nesse jogo
No... Clair Redfield not back
EL MEJOR JUEGO DE RESIDENEVIL Y AHORA VOY A REVIVIR MI INFANCIA
Nooo merci ! Je voulais un RE3 remake, mais comment on a pas, je laisse tombé la saga. Je suis fatiguée de Lion.
Ver esse trailer e lembrar de Bitorez Mendes, Osmund Sadler e Ramon Salazar, sem precisar pesquisar, mesmo depois de mais de uma década sem pegar nessa obra... olha... isso é impacto.  Por favor, Capcom, se a Ashley continuar birrenta, deem pelo menos alguns gritinhos diferentes pra ela... porque "LEON, HEEELP!" e HELP ME, LEON!!" me dá pesadelos até hoje.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh coe menor quase infartei aqui
I know a lot of people who will love this.
espero que no la caguen y que no vuelvan a ashley una mujer empoderada segura de si misma que pueda matar zombies y que le de ordenes a leon... y lo peor de todo seria que ya no use pollera.
resident evil 4 is just legendary. nostalgic. euphoria. re4 remake gonna be astronomical
Almost at 6 😎
1:52 I hope they didn't remove the car music
😍❤️❤️❤️❤️😃🥲👍👍
ps4 please capcom
I think capcom is trying to make re4 a scarier and darker version than the original and I love that
This game has the worst controls in history and playing isn't even worth consideration
Bro I freaking love this game I would love to start over again  new graphics too 😁
Help me Leon HELP
Resident Evil 4 ❤❤😭😭👍👍😎😎🤯🤯🤩🤩😍😍😘😘
YESSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!
No tienen ni idea lo que vengo esperando este remake, me hacen feliz.
Time to grind re 4 over n over again till this comes out
Ashley en mejor calidad :D
How do they not show a quick cut of a chainsaw starting at the end of the trailer?
At the beginning when I saw this is state of play, I thought it was going to be abandoned not residential evil 4
Ashleys hair seems off when they cover her ears to me, like looks super bulky compared to og
It's amazing,because this game is  the favorit RE in PS 2. 👍
I grew up on those capcom games , sorry this looks like 🗑. If it ain’t like the last 2 games it’s 💩.
No to będzie grane.
Can’t wait for this one to have subtitles so I can understand the dialogue this time!
very well representation of Spain and amazing game
One of my favourite game finally get remake. Idk how many time I replay this game. Hope can get decent PC before it came out.
Merchant: "Welcome, Stranger!  Got somethin' that might interest ya'.
I walked 11 kilometers to get a PS2 copy as an 18 year old, because I didn't save enough for a return bus ticket. It was worth every effort. I am a 34 year old pot bellied man now, let's see if it's worth the download effort.
Blown away by the detail. I almost can’t recognize it as re4 it’s so different. If they can pull off what they did with re2 remake then this will be a masterpiece.
LEEEOOOOOON!!!!
I'm such weird person  I saw that ada part for 10 times
Wenoamechaintesama 😎, tumajarbisaun 🤧, wifenlooof 🥵, eseliftsterbraun 🥶
Espero que añadan "MINIMO" un dlc de "Voces Clasicas" para escuchar de nuevo "AHI ESTA" "MATALO" "DETRAS DE TI IMBECIL"
Time to play as Chad Leon again 😎
Te voy a hacer en picadillos, boy am i gona buy this one if its on the pc too!
"Help me, Leon!"
we all came here for the merchant isn't that right, *strangers?*
Anybody knows the name of the song?
Will be Spain this time or still mexican people? hahaha
Resident Evil 4 - State of Pay
Still waiting for dragons dogma 2 💀
I have not played RE4 !! I am hyped
Noooo why on ps4 no 😭 Please You will make a ps4 version please 😭🙏
remember its a REMAKE not a REMASTERED. So dont be too mad when they change it up alot
I hope they make ashley more helpful. She was annoying sometimes. Also I hope they keep inventory like the original. Moving items around to make space was hella satisfying.
Хуета,ещё та.
Hopefully praydogs vr mod ends up working for this, re4 vr was already fun with quest 2 graphics
Yooooooooooooooo!
what????
Capcom if you're reading this, go back and remake resident evil 3 again.
This is the only non T virus RE game I liked.  I’ve beat this game so many times.  Really excited to see this remade.
show de bola!! porem um game que vc zera muito rapido para pagar mais de 300 reais em lançamento, ai acaba não valendo a pena! comprei todos os outros no lançamento, zerei e estacionei, não sei se esse pego no lançamento pagando preço cheio não
RE4 is great, but what I really want is CV...
Where's my infinite rocket
Code Veronica please !
I hope they keep Ashley screaming lioooon lioooon
finally, the best title in the history is coming. Thanks you capcom
Now only Dragons Dogma Remake is missing.
if that will be similar to RE2 remaster-that will be so cool
This is pathetic. Too many remakes. ROFL
Ну поки що, ахуенно!
Finally.
きちゃーーーーーーーーーーーー
Considering I can't buy a ps5 in my country atm, I am PRAYING that this is coming to PS4...
Yeeeeeessssss 💓💓
hoping they still have the save theme on the remake🙏🏾
It's Ada in a turtle neck for me
as much as I hate it not being on last gen I support this games release more then Gotham knights for the simple fact 2 years is more understanding the ps5 and xbox series x has not been out that long i think Gotham knights is gonna feel that pain in sales while this one might have more success since it waited a little longer to do it its very easy to support early forced next gen when you have $1000 to throw at a scalper or got very lucky when billions of people dont have your luck or money waiting till next year so more next gen consoles can be sent out was the right call
Resident Evil 12  ?   4   3  ?  😐🗣👤👤🗣👤🗣🗣🗣🗣👀
Finally !  will pre order this game !
Epic!
YEEEESSSSSSSSSS🙌🙌🙌🙌😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻🌋🌋🌋🌋💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃
"Un forastero!" return????
Im exited for it... But that was a terrible trailer.
"LEOOON, HEEELP!!" in 4K.
yieeyy
Leon help me leon is back
Can't wait to play 😍
I Hope they respect the intro voice
So is the og cast returning or is it gonna be another capcom recast
I wonder if they keep the line about "ballistics".
I hope to see the game on ps4
Leon x Ada
Get ready for the PC mods come next March...  Also...merchant better be the same voice.  I was waiting to hear at least and audio of.. "Hello stranga"
I understand the complains but anyone saying that the remake of resident evil 2 was shorter than the original are just moronic. The average time it took to beat was 6-1/2 Hours and that's someone who was a game veteran. Understand that in 1998 games were not at all what they are today and so the idea of taking time to find key items and explore in weird areas or secret locations was a new system to most. So the remake of re2 is 8ish hours if you just do the main quests and don't diverge at all. The average player is about 30hrs. Re3 on the other hand was a joke but looking into it, this was not their priority and was being developed alongside re2 remake and that is the fault of capcom, they royally f*cked up. But supposedly this has been in development for years and, to most, is considered *the best* Resident Evil. I'm optomistic but there is the possibility they'll release another RE3, but I doubt it. Maybe got cocky with RE2 release and rushed the 3rd, but just hopeful they learned their mistakes and keep it as is - if not, add more content - and do is another RE2.
Super hyped 🔥🔥 cannot wait
"Morir is vivir"
Resident Evil 4 Remake? Just shut up and take my money now.
¿Nos hacía falta otro remake?
Stranger, stranger... Now that's a game!
I wanna see how the regenerators are going to look
unas ganas de tener la red9, tmp y striker trucadas al mango. manso juegooooi
Sólo por esto, me acabo de poner de meta una Play 5 en 2023, no se diga más.
LEON KENNEDY
Action game not "Survival Horror" lol, anyway nothing special, for now, the original was overrated and meh.
Apakah disini asly akan tetap menjadi beban nya si leon wkwkwkwkwk LEONNN HELLLPPPP LEOONNN HELPPP  CUKKK CUKK!!!
OH BABY!!!!!
I really hope it has all the unlockable weapons/armor from the original game
I've never liked RE4 so far. Let's hope the remake can change my mind.
Leon ! Help me leon !
Agora eu preciso de um ps5
the tech and visuals are there for sure. I'm more worried about the pacing as if they wanted to keep it surprising they'd have to change the sequences , bosses etc. Otherwise it's just gonna be a re-skin. It's not just the visuals that have to be "the same but better" but gameplay as well. Hard to pull off.
One of my favorite games. Too bad the remaster for this game had bad control movements (for ps4 and PC) i couldn't play it....
My only concern is that they don't cut out  curtain parts of the game out
Leon without Paul Mercier feels so wrong
Para cuando el remake de resident Evil 8?
Demais, será q vai sair pra ps4 ou apenas pra ps5???
Rapiiidooo rapiiidooooo
I hope they release PC physical copy for this one, I was able to purchase an exclusive physical edition for RE2 but they never released any for the games later.
Loved resi 4 more than anything, I've not played & completed any game as much, finding all the secrets & easter eggs was great, really hope they stuff this one full of as many...especially having Ashley call Leon a pervert for the wrong camera angle, so much went into tha game, hope this one lives up after the disappointing REmake 3
遂に来てしまったか
Ufff👌
As spaniard, i would be upset if they change our mexican accent and our 80s life style XD
"Hysoka appears"
the visuals are crazy already but I'm hoping it's better than original it's definitely overrated
PC?
This is gonna be awesome
Que fome que ya no saldrá en PS4 igual:(
Quem tem os jogos do RE não precisa dos filmes.
This game will also come for ps4 🥲
Where’s Luis at?!
This game has almost as many releases as skyrim... :-)
Olee pokemon españita y ahora resident españita. Orgulloso de ser español.
Legendary))
W'
Joder por fin españoles 🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸 arriba, reconquista y vox 😭😭
Low poly , low texture enviroment . I doubt this will change until release. They need to overhaul the engine and use new lightning too. Look like an old gen game.
Of course they have to milk the RE4
i hate all resident evil
If they censor Ashley or dialogue (or anything) I'm boycotting this and starting a fan remake.  Ballistics or bust.
when does he come?
So I guess Leon hasn't aged in 6 years?Ashley is less hot already and the gsme will be cut by a 3rd....idk about this.kinda shows how bankrupt the games industry is when they can't make anything original
Be prepared to lock and load, stranger!
I wanna get some cheeks clapped
It is coming to ps4?
totalmente innecesario y la caida de la franquisia
Never played the original but heard its the best one. Guess we'll have the next-gen RE2 and RE3 to play while waiting. What ever happened to that announcement anyway?
duda importante...... ¿estara para xbox???
Awesome!
Idk man.....  getting re village vibes.... not sure ginna need ti see ganellay
حمااااااااااااس
Freuee mich so drauf
so much love for this
Can't Wait ...
GOT SOME RARE THINGS ON SALE... STRANGERS
It looks great! I'm still not a fan of the Soy Kennedy look they've given him from Resi 2 though.
Hope the priest plaga still walk around saying "moldy std"
knew it
ashley RE engine
If we can't peek on Ashley's underwear this isn't a remaster of RE4.
No sé cómo expresarme ahora, re4 es y será siempre mi juego favorito de re, muchas gracias por hacer esto ahora
Agora é aguentar a Ashley pedindo socorro em 4k
PS4 please🙏🙏🙏🙏
Y esa música de flamenco del principio???
🔥
Compatível com PS4 ?
Caralhooooo mano cadê os br
I hope we get a weapon wheel of some sort in this game. I love RE4, but having to constantly go in the pause screen for your inventory gets old real fast.
This better lives up to the original or be better. Excited to see the whole village, castle and boss battle in RE engine
Ai minha vuaida, ai Jesuais!!!
Dauert noch lang aber, Ick Freu MIR!
0:14
The intro Looks like s Netflix serie's Narcos hahahahaha
I hope they keep Leon's one-liners.  "Where is everybody going? Bingo?"
Where'd everybody go? Bingo?
Sixth .. 2022/6/3 - 2:51pm
FAITES LA DIFFÉRENCES ENTRE INFECTÉS ET ZOMBIES POUR LES INCULTES !
deveria sair pro ps4 tambem
Morir es Vivir
I hope capcom don t cut parts Like re3
I look forward to mods which will save this game from being ruined by woke bulls**t.
Code Veronica next.

I wish Capcom remake the Dino Crisis 01 and 02 game 😢 some of us hopping that to happen
Where's everyone going bingo?
Only for PS5?
One of my favourite of all time
I am meh on this, unpopular opinion i get it, but its only because this game is what started the shift from survival horror (which i loved about RE) to action, I must admit though that this game is an amazing ACTION game
YES PLEASE
they prolly messed up the gameplay ill wait for the reviews
24 месяц?
asley tetap beban
The whole world is shaking rn
Can't wait for "Leon! Help!“ in HD.
Why remake
YES LETS GOOOO!!!
cojelo cojelo cojelo
bỏ hết tiền vào mua truyện rồi k có tiền nữa đầu xin các bố đợi khi nào con lớn con kiếm đc tiền rồi thì hãy ra game ạ
Lá vem bomba
looks like cheap unity 3d game
This is What i want!!!
Bah bah
Resident Evil 5 Remake when?
Ahhhhh!! xd
I can't wait for this game to get ported to the next gen consoles coming out in the next 15 years
I can see my PC burning
I really hope they do the original voices and dialogues as a Hispanic myself I enjoyed the zombies swearing at Leon 😅
Can't wait to play this on VR! [Remembers Giant bugs] 😨
MY HEART IS HAPPY
CODE: Veronica next please.
In Galicia they don’t hear nor make flamenco😒 And I expect voice actors not to be Mexicans again.
All y’all are giving the reason for them remaking these games and slapping 60 dollars on it
Não decepcione Capcom. Por favor
let's f*cking gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I can’t wait to play the game next year on the PS5
remaster of remaster of remaster
So glad this is multiplat. More ppl get to enjoy this.
I can't wait 😭
Welcome
Seems that Ashley doesn't carry that much ballistics this time😅
OBRIGADAAAAA, TOMARA QUE VENHA PRA PC TAMBÉMMMMM
Osmund saddler 🔥🔥😭
Me who have only ps4 and this game is only for ps5
Just hope they don't cut out the great cheesyness
O game mais vendido do PS2 no Brasil, tendo finalmente o seu merecido remake. Espero que não tenha cortes!
Gente 😎 es oficial tenemos resident evil 4 remake 🥳
Atleast include the ps4 pro :'( its the same RE engine on village
Me lo fece scoprire un vecchio amico, parlavamo di un possibile remake, eccolo, Lorenzo aveva ragione, spero sia degno.
I'm excited for this but I will no be excited for the heavy breathing regenerator and iron maiden
Bingo ?..... ;(
Huh, this look more scary than OG RE4.
I've been waiting this to be remaster and now it finally happened
Best way to play the original was with a wii-remote. This might look 50x better, but the shooting will never feel as perfect.
Same re4 with new graphics.....plz create new Re
Time to go back to ..."LEON LEOOOON. HELP ME LEOOON" cant wait.
E assim a Capcom lucra rios com haters metendo o pau nela de todos os oados possíveis ❤
"Welcome Stranger.. What are you buying?" ... The only thing they need to say for me to buy this game..
I hope Jarl Balgruf reprises his role again
Yes! Thank you Playstation! Capcom! And all the staff!! Btw we are waiting Resident evil 6 remake in 2029-203+ maybe..and RE9 203+
The best Resident evil game played it on ps2
many version of this game.. I can't take it anymore!!! why? they don't remake resident code veronica
hopefully the controls will be better than it was on gamecube
Imagine the massive outrage if the game gets cut down like REMake3
Now we have to save Ashley in 4k.
Wanna pre order pls launch pre orders now.
I can’t believe it they announce it 😭❤️
Dude enough remakes there are literally so many different versions of the game
Shinji Mikami, who worked on the RE4 scenario, wrote it in just three weeks, so he was left unskilled in the scenario. I hope he's been reworked into a satisfying scenario in the remake.
"What're ye buyin...?"   ;)
LEON HEEEEEEEEEEEELP
Does it have actual Spanish voices?
Yessssssss less go
UFF!!!
Era isso que a gente esperava da Rockstar e dos GTA
Just don't let it be so overly scripted like the last games...
господи только не обосритесь
Capcom hitting homeruns after homeruns ⚾
Can't wait for Ashely to scream her lung out on my ears again. LEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON HELPPPPPPPPPPPPP
I hope they incorporate some elements from RE 3.5
I don't think Leon's one liners aee gonna be on this one
AJESTA
為何里昂的背影看起來很胖
мегахорош
I doubt that this can hold up to the original
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
С нетерпением жду)--
ااااااخ يالشوق اااااااخ الجمال اااااخ يالمتعة راجع  يا جمااااااعة مب مصدق 😳😳😳😍😍😍 الحب رااااااااجع ليون و افضل الأجزاء  رزيدنت ايفل و افضل لعبة في حياتي رااااااااجع  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Everyone will simp for ashley now
I feel old after watching this Trailer
V6 conseguem estragar oq foi bom! Cagaram no 2 e 3.  Expectativa é caganeira no 4.
inb4 5hr game only
Ganados ps5
RE 4💕🤍❤️‍🔥🔥🌷🥰💓😘💙
the village looks smaller
Im ready putos
Can you imagine people going crazy over fake news of a bloodborne remake and playstation keep making remakes of games that like 10% of customers want.
I prefer the original voice actors
leooooooooon -ashley said
Leon's voice in the end was so chilling! The game looks amazing.
Please next Metal Gear Solid Remake
Bet you capcon gonna have am exclusive pre-order for authentic replica of Leon's Jacket for t least 2k+
i hope they dont censor the jokes like they did in re4 vr
Ps2 graphics...
I'm not holding my breath anymore for this series. Too many past disappointments.
Leon Help! 🤣
La boucle…
الحماس يمشي فيني
Is this a dream?? Am I dreaming???
Are they just going to skip code Veronica
Meu Deus:D que demais
don't let us down CAPCOM
They could have made the movies so much better instead of basing them around Mila Jovovicth (typo)
You're Welcome
😍😍😍😍
YEEEEAAAA finally is remake 🤩
As a game designer, I can say that this game shaped my history and the way I think about games. Could play every day and I would never be bored. Can't wait to play this reboot, especially the village sequence. The best RE ever, for sure.
Holding off until playlength disclosed, 3 was an utter embarrasment
Re4 is the best resident evil series from all
With real Spaniard voices this time?
I Remember the one zombie I call a white rubber monster I f***kn left my PC and ran away when I see him 😂
I dont think that game will come this 2023 When globalists are plotting to make us homeless and unemployed to throw us into welfare. I just only remember “ Youll own nothing and be happy”
Greatest Game of all times
SE VIENE PAJA
Ashleyyyy 🤣
Shzuejdjjxjx yesss!!!!
is it coming on ps4?
welcome
Please,make Ashley less crybaby than the original >.<
I’m glad Capcom cares about its classics so much.
Ah memories...
JODER!!! Esto es emocionante!! Estoy feliz  (PD: este es el comentario en español que buscabas)
Can someone remind me what content in a nutshell was cut from re3 and 2 remake? If I remember correctly originally re3 was short on it's own. Can someone elaborate more?
now we can get angry with asley in 4k
,😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
ในที่สุด!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YASSSSS LEON'S JACKET IS BACK BABY!!!!
I,m so Hyped ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
It s HEREEE its REALLY HEEREE😍😍😍😍
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssss
I need this now!!!
I wonder if Ashleys gonna be just as annoying in remake as she was in the original😅
como fã da Saga o RE4 não é o meu favorito por conta da ação e de alguns cenários como a ilha, eu espero que eles melhorem de verdade o Survivor horror, que chegue perto do nível do RE1 Remake e nada dessas reimaginaçao que estragou um pouco do 2 e destruiu o 3.
If this remaster enables us walking while shooting, its gonna be amazing
I remember playing this on PS2’!!!!
can't wait to see the merchant
I’m excited for the idea that we might be able to use Leon’s jacket for the whole game on the second playthrough and beyond. That was one of exactly two flaws with the original.
I don’t understand a company patting itself on the back for another crappy remake. I also can’t understand why people are willing to shell out money on the same tired remakes over and over. Honestly Xbox line up looks better.
Is this ps5 only? I hope ps4 pro too
shut up and take my money
اخيراً 🔥🔥🔥🔥😭
Vai ser o melhor remake de todos da franquia.
Great trailer but can't help thinking if they're remaking all these RE, why not remake RE1 and REZero too....? Would love to see those in modern graphics and gameplay.
It really could've been Code: : Veronica, they've just resident evil eighted 4
Can’t escape Ashley’s scream not even here
I don't know re4 remake released
To PS4
Hope Ashley don't forgot how to call Leon for help
soundtrack and audiodesign are very messy/questionable yet, let's see how the final version turns out
Re4 didn't need a remake, but I must confess, this looks amazing.
Most things about RE4 is perfect, except the disapponted final boss. Even the sub-boss Garrador is so much better in term of challenging and excimenting.
всегда любил эту игру , очень хочу поиграть в очередной ремикс. Но я живу на территории РФ ....
habrá versión para PS4?
Leon😱
Too bad it's only for next gen.
Разъеб Михалыч
Ashley looks very cute, still her voice is still the same tho... Annoying as ever 😃
Guys I think I have been teleported back in time I'm seeing a new resident evil 4 trailer
Didn't like it.
New Ashley is cute.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Wonder what modders are gonna do to Ashley with this one!
CAPCOM BRING BACK ALL RE GAMES IN RUSSIAN STEAM!!!!!!!!!!!
Love the location *_*
LEON LEON LEON!!!
نبي دبلجة بالعربي او ترجمة ما يصير كذا ..!!!
This game was the reason I got a GameCube.
Everyone's a gangsta until Ashley say "LEON HELP!"
Finally, it's about time we see the merchant again   " *What're you buying?* "
This Version better have 2 Punch Rock hitting Scene!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
hope this gonna be another masterpiece like RE7, RE2, and RE8..... and plis no more cut content like RE3 aka RE2 DLC..... and hoping we got a lot of new stuff here too
You forgot THE GAMEPLAY!
I don't like the newer younger-sounding Leon.  Hopefully he's at least as sassy as the original RE4 Leon in this remake.
I can't wait to play it. 🔥❤️
EXTRANJERO!!!!
I am looking for  herror based  experience
I didn't get into this franchise until people had already lost faith in it. As a result I have never once played RE4. That said I cannot wait for this to drop so I can experience my own version of the memories so many of you have of the original.
YEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS
Leoon heeellppp
I'm still waiting for the silent hills
I want to stay single for now..
is it a remake or another new game????I've never played resident evil 4
Yes!!!
Leon: "This time, it can be different..."  "i will do some overtime..."
Esse vai ser Day One pra mim! sem sombras de duvidas <3
el agua se ve toda chafa
I only wanna see one change just make ashly mutie
WELCOME STRANGER!!!!!
Cant wait to be ada hope she has campagne too
WOT ARE YOU BOIYIN STRAYNGER!!!
It will release on ps 4 ?
Resident Evil 4 on PS5 next year? No way! (Way.)
IF THEY CHANGE THE MERCHANTS VOICE ACTOR ILL BE FUMING.
I don't have a computer or video game but I will definitely watch some streamer playing this wonder
Old gen???
The best game in history.👏
Capcom的財富密碼

apakah si beban tambah jadi beban
I wann see krauser
I loved the trailer but I think it's really cool to release it only for the most advanced video games
crying in spanish right now
Ah yes finally i can see new ashley in r34.
A rework of a 10/10 game surely is going to be tough, can’t wait to see the results
to me the perfect RE4 was the Wii edition. aiming was gaming peak for me. you can't do any better than that.
Ashley: "leon help"
Can't wait for the Mikeburnfire playthrough of this with Zack
solo para ps5.
Never played this game, this remake will be something to look forward to 😁
IT IS HERE
Morir es vivir...
The graphics are next level
My childhood reborn
Ps4 🤔🤔
I cannot wait to hear "HELP ME LEOOOOOON", sounds like music to my ears
Sembra figo, chissà cosa ne pensa Sabaku No Maiku.....
No gameplay no es bueno.
Another year another resident evil 4 rerelease
What's Leon's jacket gonna look like!!?
Who else thought of Netflix at 0:30.
Sounds more like Mexico lol
Hopefully this still has at least a little bit campy feel
Something is wrong with leon s jacket
If they ever gonna cut Regenerators sequence from here, i won't even touch this game
oooh lets goo
Очень информативно.... захватывающее... мдаа
Just amazing !
Modders when the game is out: "Its free real estate."
Yuhuuu
Ashley: LEOOOOOON  Leon : Not this again
Ew I don't like Saddler's voice
This game has to be as long as the original but I’m super excited and cannot wait here comes my childhood😁😁😁😁
wait.. just wait... my favourite part
Please don’t mess this up
Can't wait to hear Ashley scream again
*Childhood Memories will be Born Again*
Oh you want to buy a ps5 and the deluxe version of this game? NOT ENOUGH CASH, STRANGER.
AT  least the best RE! " Detrás de ti imbecil!!!! "
Nicee! Let's gooo!
Next, Code Veronica, please 🙏
Better hope the Broken Butterfly is as broken as it was in the original.
ну да зачем чет изобретать можно все игры тупо ремейки делать
Ohhh no gonna get ruined by woke garbage
Ahhhh I’ll buy it at a high price
Офигенно!
Dang... can't wait...so hyped
Oh yess, can't wait to meet my boy, my friend, my soulmate, the merchant
Ahhh.... Lord Sadler I can't wait
Favorite game of all time, hands down. I'm really worried that they will disappoint, since it's such a high bar to pass.
Ahhh. Looking forward to Ashley slowing me down in all its remake glory again.
обоже 💔 мне есть ради чего жить ещё год
LEOOOOOONNNNNNNN HELP ME
morir es vivir
hope they keep some level of cheesyness in the remake
Ну наконец-то! Круто, обалденно, великолепно, изумительно, шедеврально!!!
Esto va a ser épico, papus
Lets see if this remake can replace the original RE4. I know its a longshot but hey.
Very dubious about this one. Excited and hopeful no doubt, but reserved.
mientras no la cagen como el re3 todo bien
They need to make Leon bigger and more mature
Hollywood and the gaming industry only know how to do remakes now...lol...no creativity
more cult enemy monster villagers, leooooooon................hellllllp
Interesting to see how you can remake a game that still stands up 100 percent today.
Nice! Another one RE remaster. I hope, one day, to see a Silent Hill 2 remaster too
can't wait to watch a YouTuber play it
I can't wait to get the metal armor for Sherry , now in HD lol
Resident Evil forever
Whataya buyin?
What about code veronica?
Please please please, to anyone complaining about this remake, simply keep playing the originals.
حماااااااس🔥🔥
Hype!hype!hype!
*ISSO NO PLAYSTATION VR2 SERÁ SIMPLESMENTE INCRÍVEL!!! 😁🤩😆🥳🎉*
Espérons qu'il soit aussi bon que RE2 remake et qu'ils ne fassent pas comme le remake du 3 c'est-à-dire retirer la moitié du jeux d'origine.... Croison les doigts..
Just finishined RE4 again on the steam desk last night. This announcement is f*cking Awesome!!
Get out 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
🔥
Il miglior Resident evil, lessss gooo.
Ohhhhh yeahhhh boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiissssssssssssss 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Great picture, but I hate the 3d model of Leon from RE2 remake, because he look weak. Leon from re4, re6 and films looks like a strong person.
Waiting for that merchant guy.
I really hope this isn't a trim down version of the original, which has been the trend with the other remakes
THIS BETTER NOT BE A SHORTASS RE3 REMAKE MOMENT AGAIN
Lord Sadler...
I can't wait to see the regenerator in freezer room in 4k. Even ps2 graphics terrifies me in childhood times
Лучшая часть. BIOHAZARD навсегда в моём сердце. Это будет лучший ремейк из всех
não destruam o legado de resident evil 4 pfv
Leeeeooooonnnn!
This could be the version of RE4 that it should have always been: a sequel to Resident Evil 2, rather than some one-off B-movie action adventure (which admittedly I still loved).
Wow
R.I.P. Ada's iconic red dress
Resident evil 4 Remake 🔥🔥🔥
I wish i had enough money (And Credit Card too 😟 because i will play pc one) to buy this game in 2023
Leoonnn helpppppppp
Это просто Апппппуппительно!
leon!!!! Help!!!!!!
WOOOOOOOOOOW I'M SO SO EXCITED 🔥🔥🔥🔥
So at this point RE5 remaster is guaranteed
Only remember, Ashley statement "Leon Help" Love saving typewriter and it's Music.
im so happy i called my dad
PS4 😭
Great i just a bought a ps4 😔
I love that Leon's jacket is the RE 3.5 jacket.
well.. my only hope they won't remove the line when you look up to ashley from downstairs ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Только для России будет не доступна
Me like alot of think a remake of Code Veronica makes more sense.
What're ya buyin? What're ya selling?
looks like a ps4 game the polygons are too sharp and cheap
perfect birthday present
AWESOME!
bring it to PS4 please.......
もちっとした餃子!おっｐいのペラペラソース!
Интересно, под юбку все так же можно будет посмотреть.  И как сильно пофиксят бой на ножах с Краузером.
So glad I got a PS5...get to replay old games again and again and never play anything new 🥳
YES! It looks great! Hopefully, day one!
And this is just a teaser for the trailer... Helpppp
The mini skirt lives!
things that am afraid, there will be no "overtime" dialog.
outlast 2
Ty Capcom
yes Yes YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
No VR no Buy!
Будет очень интересно наблюдать за тем как изменился Леон с ремейка RE2🤌
Yea, this did not need a remake.
overrated game 💩💩💩💩
¡Avisar a los de mas!
Hope these remakes will eventually lead to a complete reboot of RE 5 and 6, getting rid of what made those games very un-RE like.
One of the most popular games in South America
I’m kinda worried we aren’t getting a wise cracking, one liner spewing Leon in this …
Nunca es tarde para conseguir un trabajo
Sino la cagan. Cambiando las cosas q ya tiene el juego, es y seguirá siendo el mejor residet evil de todos los tiempos.
Hope they save original "ballistics"  too.
Why im not hyped?
Childhood is back
ah more resident evil remake.. no dino crisis remake capcom?
Original: "Remakes, guess after this there be one less to worry about"
Un forastero intensifies.
Leonnnn!!!
This'll be interesting. The only resident evil game I've played is RE4, this remake looks to be decent!
The merchant guy it also part the game too.  Every time you meet him in the  village, middle of woods and castle and says " *Got some rare things on sale Stranger* ".😄
AY ME MOJE
Now I can look under Ashley skirt in HD
Pointless?
I cant wait to play it i just hope it wont end up like 3
Оо это божественно)
I hope Ashley is no longer useless
But what about Leon’s original voice actor? :(
I love that they're listening to the OG fans of RE and are adding more the horror elements and not just limiting it to it's campy action roots. I got a decent 4K Roku but I need to get a TV that's able to output the Variable Refresh rate as well. Time to start saving.
"Don't come!"
honestly didn't think the rumors were real, well its legit now.
It's like re7 all over again but it's re4. Can't wait to play it!
finger cross really hope they make it a success like 2 and not butchering it like 3 . . .
Leon : ah (bleep). Here we go again. Ashley : LEON HELPPPPP!!!!!!
Esperei por tanto tempo por isso.... PlayStation euuuuu te amooo❤
Easter eggs to be found 3.24.2023
It's a remasterazation ?
WE ALL SAW IT COMING AND ITS FINALLY HAPPENING LETS GOOOOO
The fact that this trailer has fixed camera gives a lot of liberty to the other RE games. Put it on, please!!
😭😭😭
Lord Saddler
In the last shot Leon looks a little chubby
Yeah the thing is going back to Resident Evil,    Since they eFfed so badly the last two iterations.
I hope she not mad when i peek under her skirt this time in 4k.. haha
LEON LOOKS FAT PLZ FIX IT
🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Best RE of all¡¡¡
رزنت ايفل 4 العشق الذي لا ينتهي
О, это я жду.  Радует, что каркас оригинала оставлен, такими и должны быть римейки - максимально похожими на оригинал, но на новых технологиях.  Миша, 32 годика.
It would be even cooler if this game had VR SUPPORT!
Why does this masterpiece need a remake?
Is it Third person?
Yep, that's what I'm talking about because we Resident Evil Universe superfans needs this to happen. Oh by the way, Tom Holland is perfect for the Leon Scott Kennedy (Leon S. Kennedy) role while Hailee Steinfeld is perfect for the Claire Redfield role. 💯💯💯👏👏👏👍👍❤️❤️❤️
Please don't ruin this remake
Can't wait
Xloss
La verdad un tanto pesados con tanto remake, re4 fue el primer resident que jugué y es tremendo, eso no quita que porque jueguen un poco con la luz y texturas vaya a pagar 60 otra vez estamos locos o que xDDDDD  Estaría bien recordar esa esencia y no hacer juegos para “speedrunners”, capcom para mí ahora es Dmc y Monster Hunter poco más
I can't wait to see luis sera 😟
Lo único que pido es que este en español latino
1:46 every BIO-Title in every remake sequel: Globalization (1996), Welcome to Raccoon City (2019), Assault on Nemesis (2020), and yes "NEW TESTAMENT" (2023).
Ok this only makes sence if its going to be a PSVR title if not if going to be worse then the Wii version
How will they mess up and subvert this one? 🤔
Capcom. Doing what they do best.
Its official trailer?
I hope they include the bingo this time
J'espère que capcom c'est inspiré du vrai Resident Evil 4 le vrai jeu d'horreur qui n'est jamais sorti celui avec les fantômes  et les mauvais esprits et pas encore nous faire un Resident Action Fps non merci de toute façon capcom avait annoncer que Resident Evil 4 Remake serait différent et sera le vrai Resident Evil 4 qu'à voulu dire capcom en disant cela ?
Oh my! Been waiting for this
Fellas, are we expecting the return of kicks and suplexes?
can't wait to hear "what are you buyin" and "what are you sellin" and "heheheheh thank you" in 4k
Can't wait to see how Regenerators and Iron Maidens look like... :0
Dont fk up the game pls.
But I want it now!
Are they bringing back Sandy Cheeks to voice Ashley? (Yes, the woman who voiced sandy cheeks in SpongeBob did Ashley's voice over, you'll never unhear that now that you know)
Sold!!! Its a win win...either its a masterpiece or if not, I can still play the original which is a masterpiece 🤣😁
Is It On PS4
1:28 aia
Leon help!
Pero lo importante no sale... Los ganados Hablan en español o español inventado?
Hopefully we can still take a peek at Ashley skirt and with a trophy to go with it for the effort 😆😆😆 but what about Code Veronica though that game could really use a remake!!! 😢
Leooonnn!!!!!
O melhor resident que joguei incrível   ✌🔥
LEOOOOOON
Can we move while aiming this time? 💀
Things that already in my mind when i saw this trailer:   "Welcome stranger"   "Leoooon helppp!!"  "You stay here with leon, he's better with the ladies"   *Regenerator's breathing sound *  "Mister kennedy~"  "Comrade"   *Jaws music out of nowhere *  *That spanish music in the car's radio *   "No thanks...bro"   *Chainsaw man netflix adaptation *   * Bald dude cosplay as kaneki ken*   *Haha laser parkour goes brrr *   *Ada's grapling hook sound effect *   "Where's everyone going?...bingo?"   *Villagers screaming in spanish *
Shooting in WII version is superb.
Only for ps5 and not ps4
PS4 And PS5 of course
🌹resident evil 4 🌹
LETS GOOOO
Dude this is real???
Leon is Backkk
Наконец то ))
Ohh yes Here we go again!
Someone needs to go to prison for skipping code Veronica
I'm literally hoping with fingers crossed that they didn't cut down the original gameplay length in this.
If this game will be sold twice. I will buy it twice.. I hope they will stay true to the original game and even expand on it. Thank you Capcom!!!
So....... No code Veronica remake ever? 👎🏻
ძლიიიიიიიიიივს ერთი წელიც დარჩა და შემეძლება ბავშვობა გავიხსენო და 2ჯერ პირველად ჩავიჯვა ამ თამაშის თამაშის დროს.       P.S. გუგლ ტრანსლეიტი არ დაგეხმარებათ.
I hope the sounds are much more creepy and scarier this time. Like in the castle when you keep hearing chants of "Monyas vivir" repeatedly.
Rule 34 artists on they're way like :🏃‍♀️💨
Imagine meeting the merchant ...again
got DAYUM. Isn’t the original on every platform known to man already?
Este remake va a tener mucha censura
solo para ps5????? manuda panda de mamones!!!!!
This is my childhood memories, love this game, finally RE4remake
IM SO HAPPY DUDE
Re4 is the best game I've ever played,And if it gets a scarier remake version I'm down to it.and please don't cut anything from the original
I feel they gonna remove the unlimited knife
niceu niceu ^_^
I hope RE 4 Remake will live to it's expectations of the original RE 4 and won't end up like RE 3 Remake
Leooooooooon, help me Leon!!!
"Its a big cheese."
LEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNN !
Reserv
Bro no paul mercier :(
I never get bored of this game, I can re-play over and over again at different times in life and still enjoy it.
Please Capcom, the entire game has to be here, all the details, all the locations and characters, Everything! please this game is so important for all of us, blow our minds.
hehehehe hahaha
This looks beautiful! I loved how they kept the shot of Leon in the car looking at the picture of ash! I’m extremely hyped! I hope they keep the whole shoot in the head and kick 😂or suplex!
I excited to see the world with RE engine will be amazing the village, castle, and the island also got annoy by "leon help me leon!!"
Nice
So glad the chad Leon is back!
El mejor juego de la historia acaba de resucitar.
Capcom I thank you for Making my childhood Awesome and Now I thank you again for the Remake Of the best resident Evil game of all time this is the best moment of my life right now  Capcom You're the Best Ever
c paso
Holy moly I can't believe I didn't even think about this being the next remake... Resident Evil 4 is one of the scariest games i've ever played when I was a kid.  I hope they can capture that fear again and this will be another masterpiece.
Something feels off. Why is Ada in her RE6 outfit? Why does Leon have PTSD instead of being the lovable action hero we know and love?
My favorite game!
It’s not brown ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I'm so pleased it's in third person.
Coming on PS4??
There's a video in between the black screens
1:58 who else already can hear ashley's scream ?
If they ever put it on PC I'll check it out but until then, have fun with it PS people!
Four days before my birthday :'000 it' s a sign
If they cut out the ballistics line, I aint buying.
Conveyor
Oh my gawddd!!!!!   This reminds me of that HD project for RE4 - - well, that project can now rest ;-)
what kind of lether jacket is this ????????????? !!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love PlayStation. PS4 AND PS5?
Looks scary, ngl. But it’s not giving the same vibe as re4 if I’m being really honest. Felt like re7/8. But can’t make any judgements, yet. I just don’t like how Leon still sounds so young. His re4 VA was perfect
JE NE SAIS PAS QUOI PENSER ... JE VEUX DIRE...  EN 2024 ON DOIT EXIGER UN GRAPHISME PHOTORÉALISTE, MAIS LA J'AI L'IMPRESSION QUE C'EST LA MÊME QUALITÉ QUE RESIDENT EVIL 2 REMAKE DE LA PLAYSTATION 4😕
DIOS
I'd honestly just prefer a remaster, keep all the same stuff, just better graphics.
The trailer looks amazing , I expect nothing less than a 10/10 on the remake
The One of the Best Game or The Best Game not sure... But This is Tears of Joy. When We have Leon with Punisher or Magnum or Shotguns in that village. 👍 Say woohoo with Us. 🤗
Wondering what regenerators look like...
Эй снаха!!!
Please Capcom: release for Ps4/Xbox1, like you did with Village.
IS RE4  going  to be on ps4 any chance or is it just ps5.
Regenerators and the Chainsaw man are gonna be terrifying
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
really? only ps5?
Let me guess: cut content, doesn't feel like the original and way too dark to see what's going on.
Please launch in ps4...
It's going to be lit🔥
The VR version on Quest is extremely well done. I hope the remake will get a great VR version as well.
I hope the game is as long as 4 or longer with the original bosses, enemies, guns and newer bosses and enemies.
gotta say, Code Veronica done dirty here  I pray all the content and monsters make the cut,  I don't want another RE3make situation
Censored garbage
02:05  О ГОСПОДИ ЧТО ЭТО ЗА ДЕРЬМО
q buen momento para ser fan de RE4 pero mal  momento para ser de xbox
3.24.2023 , thats all we need to know ❤🔥
I can't help but be excited for this one in particular. Let's just hope there were no drastic changes from the original, to the worse at least.
¡Olé!
I'm just waiting for a remake of the  "NO THX B R O!!!"
It seems they are really trying to emphasize the horror aesthetic this time around. I can dig it. Though I absolutely love the unapologetic over the top 90's action movie atmosphere of the original where Leon is a total Chad dropping one-liners all day. I expect this one to take itself more seriously.
this is nice, thanks. but can we remake some metal gear solids please?
I skipped r4 when it came out on ps2, maybe i should give it a try now.
Whoever made this game, don't hired back those useless team who made RE3 remake
Hope capcom remake Resident evil outbreak and code veronica too
I can’t wait! Hope the core gameplay stays the same. Suplexing in RE engine is going to be awesome!
The game that revolutionized the gaming industry.
Ok really cool, but where is Dragon's Dogma 2?
Why only ps💔
They should bring back original voice actor from RE4
I hope they have the same Spanish dialog "Mátalo!"
I've never play this game because watching my older brother played this when we're little traumatized me like I remember having nightmares about the chainsaw man(?) it's so scary 🥲 now I'm already 20 and I still won't play this lol I'll just watch my brother play instead
Se viene mega Doctor Salvador remake 😮.
Espero que el doblaje de los españoles del juego esta vez sí sea en español de España, el anterior era sudamericano y quedaba raro. Saludos!
Again? Really? And everyone happy? Almost everyone here play this game before. And do you want to pay again for this game? Century of Remastered. Please, Stop doing this. Create new game. Find new ideas. Stop creating 8, 18 or 25 chapter for one game universe. Find something new
2023 goty easily
А где кадры гемплея?
Ohh cool, on my 26th birthday 🥲🥹
I hope Ashley as annoying as an old version...
Please make a.i. ashley more clever.
Where's Ashley's Dumbo ears?
LETS GO!!!!!!!
I could hear the collective AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! from everyone whatching this!
Let's wish that Ashley is way more usefull this time
Leon better be looking badass like the og resident evil 4. Not the rookie look
Wow
Lol watch as like half the game is cut and the same models are used like in RE3.
Finally. I will get to hear his beautiful voice, once again in all his remade glory.            “What are ya buyin?”
Son robadooooooos
Hasta la Vista baby !!!!!!
😍😍😍❤❤❤👍👍👍
lol y yo aqui con mi ps4 XD.  vo a comprar pero una chompu igual seguro sale.
The most wanted Remaster🎊🎊
They need to step up their graphics game.
Leon is back 😁 ha ha ha ha ha The power of pony hair Anjir berapa generasi dari gamecube hp ps2 ps3 PS4 ps5  Berasa tua gw, dr anak anak sampe punya anak
El remaster del remaster :0
Hope the character control will still be similar to the original.
I hope Leon is still as sassy as he was in the original
I'm excited to see how terrifying Del Lago is going to be and hoping they keep that little easter egg when shooting at the water from the dock!!!
La caAmpaAanaaaa....es hOora de resar....
Ah I’ll Buy It At A High Prices 😍😍
I need to buy Ps5 as soon as possible!!
Music same. To same?
LETS GO
op
Capgods stay winning 🏆
Goosebumps
I hope they keep all the cursing of the Los Ganados. I can't wait to hear them curse again.
I hope Code Veronica is next.
I already miss the OG voice actors :(
Boy, I sure hope they don’t make us want to strangle Ashley like the original did, heh… heheh.🥲
Please let resident evil 4 remake be the last game for ps4
Please let resident evil 4 remake be the last game for ps4
yooo what?
do the same for re5
When i hear Ashley Screamm .. im kinda grinning for no reason xD
My favorite RE is returning.    My hype levels are over the limit. PLEASE do it right! I want RE2R levels of adaptation and creativity.
Capcom will never stop selling this game :D
Ps4 в жопе
Yup this is pure hype right here take my wallet fam :D
Leon from Newbie pistol using cop zombie survivor to Badass knife wielding secret agent zombie killer RE4 Leon at his prime is back
Going to squeeze my wallet when the preorders go live.
Can't wait to buy it and I hope Code Veronica: X gets the same treatment too!
Capcom please dont ruin my childhood, this is my best childhood game for sure. Don't cut any content from the original plzz
Wow just wow... Capcom always knows how to get things going again.  They have their ups and downs, but man when they're up, they really go up :)
Never played the original but 2023 is the moment.
графика говно.
Wasting time remaking a game that didn't need to be remade. Meanwhile bypassing the one RE title that would have benefitted from being remade.
El momento a llegado 🤯🤯
L E G E N D  İ S   C O M İ N  G !!!
Gracias por poner a paco de lucia de fondo
GOOSEBUMPS!!! Wow, this looks incredible! Looks like they've upped the horror element of it and visually it's just stunning. CAN'T WAIT!
if they didnt cut anything from the original "i'll buy it at a high price"
Why is this on Playstation state of play? They not got big enough titles of their own that they can put on?
YES!!!!
what if chris redfield shows up and hes just like "chris redfield" and then punches the rock
Well, let's hope they did not cut lots of content out and jumped over many things like they did in the Residet Evil 3 remake, lol. They took their sweet time with the Resident Evil 2 remake and thanks to the success of it they just released a clone of Resident Evil 2 Remake asap and it turned out to be mediocre in a sense.  I really hope this RE4 is just as long, suspenseful and atmospheric like the original. Otherwise I won't have any fun. Not hyped for now, I am interested.
Can't wait for the updated mercenary gameplay and updated merchant. :)
me vengoooo
С этого дня в режиме ожидания
❤️❤️❤️❤️💜💜💜👍🏻👍🏻💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐❤️💜resdnt evil 👍🏻 2023 “””.
Don't Cut the double El Gigante encounter.. or you better show me Mike
I really hope that's not luis's voice, Sounds a bit weak.... at the very least it's a downgrade from the Og. Like Ashley's redesign tho games got me Excited.
ааа эти мурашки  ожидания
can't trust capcom after RE3 remake
Loving this kind of "soft reboot" to the resident evil franchise. For me re4 is up there with some of the greatest video games of all time. And so far this looks amazing.
To be honest. I like the original faces better than this. But lookin forward to this experience!
I hope this is closer to the RE2 remake and not the RE3 remake.
Such a waste of time and resources
Yes
And Code Veronica ?!
The best RE in the series
We will see Ashley screaming "Leon help me Leon" again in ps5 version.
I'm gonna say the same thing I said when they announced the Lion King remake... When the original is already perfect, you have no where to go but down.
i just hope they dont cut stuff out like they did with 3
if they've tried to make it straight horror instead of campy, I'm hard pass
YESSSS RESIDENT EVIL 4
Jeahhhhh.... I can't wait.... I'm Happy
i miss los iluminados
Is this RE 4 remake? A lot of people don't like RE 4 and say RE 4 is bad but I just enjoy the game.
I have played re4 on almost everything. Console, PC, VR, even Mobile when it was a thing, this game is practically a part of me!
I hope that they develop in Windows as soon as possible
Just wow
nooo pls let me see the new REGENERADOR!!!!! they where the SCARIEST enemy of this game
Leoooon help me!
Can’t wait to buy this game AGAIN, and get yelled at by Spanish town folk, like home.
Praying they don’t used RE2 remake controls and stick with something similar to the original
with Unreal 5 ?! WOW !
Ashley looks very pretty.  I always liked her AI when moving out of my gunfire when I have to quickly turn & fire unlike Sheva who stands there staring at me & blocks my shots.  Essentially taking one for the enemies.  When that happens, I have to walk around Sheva to connect shots during heated battles.  It's so annoying!  Was it that difficult to modify Ashley's duck or get-behind-my-gunfire AI & apply it to Sheva that they totally disregarded using it?  Will definitely get this game.  I have played every N.A. released RE game over these past 22 years except for Survivor thus far. Capcom next needs to modernize the 5th cannon game in the franchise; Code Veronica X! Would be perfect for a VR version too!
on my c1 oled i'm already scared
ERECTION !
Finally bbs gonna like it🤩
Remember the tiny guy who sounded like Peter Lore? "It may surprise you, but I am only 20 years old."
I genuinely disliked a lot of the original but this one looks like it may redeem RE4 for me.
I immediately have a hint where the last part of the vid might be.
This is gonna be awesome!!
Take more time you can cause we need this better than we thought!
Just 4 days ago i was playing the original one on steam...for no reason. I was just having some old time fun. And today this trailer drops. I can not express my happiness...it's beyond everything at this moment.
Now, lets see how much of the original they change or flat out cut from the game.
why did you show me a powerpoint
Well I’m buying me a PS5
It's Not Coming In Ps4?
No way a game coming out literally on my birthday I gotta get it its fate bro
De mis juegos favoritos , muy emocionado y con ganas de jugarlo ya 🥲.
MORIR ES VIVIR
As long as mercer is Leon im happy.... But it isn't
Game terbaik di ps2
Code Veronica should have been remade. 4 is fine the way it is.
4のリメイクはアツい！！
I’m curious how this will turn out.   CODE: Veronica is due for a remake…
This is the one remake that literally just needs updated graphics and that’s it, if they change any of the monsters in any way I’m out! ❤
😍😩😍😩😍😩😍😩😍😩
MORE
I hope I'll have a ps5 by then...
Hope Capcom's own outsource sweatshop studio M-Two had no involvement with the project
Yeeee3eeeeeeeeeeesssssssß
Release it on ps4 toooooo
i wonder how regenarator looks likes...
LEOOOONNN HEEEEEEELLLLPPPP!!!!!!
Cool, but wake me up when we get the Code Veronica remake!
🤑
What are you buyin : our old friend used to say
Matando güeros!
Gta 4 remacht
I mean this is cool and all but I can't believe they skipped remaking Code Veronica X.
Ps4 😭
top
Terrible voice actors. Was that Luis? Fakest spanish accent ever 🤦‍♂️ and don’t get me started with the priest. He sounds more British than Spanish 😂
Im happy but i don't have my hopes up considering how they butchered RE3 remake.
Waiting for it ❤️
Who’s happy? Who is happy? 🎉
Can't wait for this Remake tho.... At last one of my Favourite childhood game will get his own Remake besides RE 2 and 3 tho ✨✨
This has the potential to be game of the year if they do it right
Leon! Help!!
i like it❤
¿Quieres mi riñón? No hay pedo, Por este juego lo doy todo, 1200 horas que le tengo dedicadas al RE4.
Si Ada ya estaba hermosa en el primera remake, no me puedo imaginar aqui, pero donde chotas esta el vestido rojo ?
I better be allowed to look up HD remaster Ashley's skirt
plz don't tell me Ada is without cheongsam this time
Будет ли перевод на русский - это очень интересно
김레온! 그가 온다! 김레온! 그의 시간! 김레온! 찬양 하라! p.s.  아! 근데 ㅅㅂ! 에슐리 왜 너프됐냐...(1분57초)
I’m so pumped this is next level amazing 😍
If this is 100% true to original and with quality of life improvements we have another masterpiece of a masterpiece
Can't wait for this remake. This looks way better.
I wonder how U3, El gigante, verdugo, and Bittorez "big chief" mendez will looks like
Слава богу я дожил до этого.
That one segment I can't wait for; Defending Ashely in the house being attacked by infected villagers on a stormy night.
nem tô acreditando
How do you improve that which had no flaws🤔
as a man that owns 5 re4 copies across all platforms do i get a discount?
leon : sir can i ask you may you see this girl  other people : ARAREROOO!!! ARIESTA ARIESTA  when we found her become teamate "LEOOOON HELPPPP LEEOOON" TF this girl
*To hear the: LeOooooOOn HHhHeAalp, will be heard with improved sound*
Please add walking and aiming at the same time.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSAS
Finallyyyyy
If they remake RE 5, I hope they not add Sheva and keep it the way it was originally revealed. Chris solo against hundreds of Majini.
EEeew they redid some of the voice acting.
Yuhu.... Favorite Resident evil... I play this many many time and finished many time too... Can wait for Buy can Play.. 🥰🥰🥰🥰
I think I saw Jack Krauser in the trailer...
No OG RE4 voice actors...utter fail
2023 😵‍💫
I Cant Wait to hear Again "LEON LEON" 🤣 But Still I Hope It Lives To The Hype!!!
LEON!!!   HEEELP!!!!!
Redfield Lineage: Remastered
LEON!  HELP ME LEON!!
1:19 luis sera
DON'T BE SHY SHOW US LEON'S FACE CAPCOM
Let's hope they focus on the main Game and don't try to add another "great" Multiplayer again.  But look's great so far.
Shinji Mikami doesn't even have a head or limbs anymore 😔😔
I didn’t play this orginal game yet, Now remake is released, I am waiting for it.
Finally
I wonder if we'll get a few twists. Like saving the dog actually makes it harder later on or it helps in more then one mission. A few more interactions with Luis. A much more realistic Ashley who sounds and acts like a terrified high school girl and gets stuck in traps or freezes up if there's too many enemies or runs away making her more vulnerable to be taken. Bruh I'm so so so excited. THE REVEAL OF THE REGENERATOR 😭 I need to breathe.
Leon Kennedy is the hottest videogame character. Prove me wrong
Man I miss old time
I am literally SO EXCITED
Achei uma bosta
Crazy, this on nxt gen…i haven’t even plyd my , re 8 yet..
Is still Eduard the same face model ?
i hope code Veronica too😀
🔥👏
Super excited for this. Also people should know from the start this isn’t going to be a 1:1 remake of RE4, it’ll be it’s own thing which I honestly don’t mind if I wanted to play RE4 I’ll go play RE4. Still hoping the iconic stuff is there though like the Regenerators. Super Hyped.
Ashley face look like mary Jane watson wkwkwkwk
Agarrenlo! Basta hijo de put4 Eeeeeeh acá!! Morir es vivir, morir es vivir.... No dejes que se escape!   De entre tantas cosas que no queremos echen a perder, una de ellas son los estupendos diálogos de los enemigos.   It's that all stranger? Hehehe thank u
OMFG! I'm so excited, i will literally be reliving my childhood!
Capcom: Got something that might interest you hehehehe
kohedlo... kohedlo...kohedlo....
Can't wait to see that guy who wears a bag over his head and wields a chainsaw!
I JUST HAD THE BIGGEDT NERDGASM OF MY LIFE😫😫😫😫😫
Hands down the best Resident Evil game.
Hello Stranger...
See you 10 months later
Awesome 👍
You guys are so slow  capcom is going to butcher this game
Capcom, resident evil 4 holds up very well. We want code veronica!
And ps4 players are disappointed as always
I hope they keep Ashley's ballistics
WE NEED RESINDENT EVIL VERONICA REMAKE
The OG RE4 was such a lightning in a bottle game, it's gonna be hard for the remake to be able to hit all the notes just right. But without getting my hopes up I do look forward to what they do with it
Remaking 4 is just so dumb and unnecessary.  Already a perfect game as is.  Why not Code Veronica instead?  Completely passed that game over.
Por favor que no dure 5 minutos cono el remake del 3
I have mixed feelings because resident evil 7 and 8 were great but resident evil 2 and 3 remake were short. I hope nothing gets cut from the original I do like the updated graphics and character designs
If the bs scavenger system is in the game  its not gonna be fun , are bosses gonna be easy to kill , stupid its ps5 only
Yo esperaré a que alguien lo juegue en stream y ver cuánto dura. Porque puede que le hayan cortado muchas partes al juego por acelerar su lanzamiento...así como sucedió con Resident Evil 3 Remake. Así que...me lo tomaré con cautela.
ojalá este disponible en ps4
I'm excited af for this.. graphics look crisp too.. just need some gameplay now
0:46 Leon's chin XD i cant unsee this XD
التحفة الفنية رجعتتت ❤️❤️ اتمنى تكون كاملة بدون اي قص بالمحتوي 💗💗
As long as I can suplex priest and find hand grenades in crows I’ll be happy
Un Forastero!
really hope it gives valuable items and coins on killing the zombies just like original one , otherwise I will end up avoiding the zombies rather than killing them
I hope to be alive when the remake comes out. This game was my childhood. I played it so much on my PS2 the disk got scratched and had to pick up a used copy. Time flies by!!
Gracias capcom te amo
Give us Code Veronica Remake!!
Why? The original is a classic. Just make a new game.
Maybe they will cut lots of content like they did on re3 maybe
Welcome back, stranger!
Dla tej gry warto kupić nową konsolę
I am so hyped 🔥🔥
1:25 PTSD
LEON!!! HELP!!!! PTSD intensifies
TE AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO CAPCOM
We need FULL PSVR2 compatibility!
:O This game is gonna be releasing on my birthday man 2023 gonna be the best gaming year.
BALLISTICS
At 0:31 I thought it's going to be a Netflix series 😂
Can't wait to see the Merchant again and get to hear his "what are ya' buyin'?"
I better hear him say "Where's everyone going? Bingo?"
LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEON HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELP
Espero que não estranhem igual o 3 e 2.
How can they not have the original voice actors again?!? I really want to love this but half of the reason why I love the original is the cheesy dialogue that it had.
Finally, the remake we all waited for.
LEEEOOONNNNNN HELLLLPPPP!!!!
Si bien este juego no requeria un REMAKE, el RE 4 original es una obra maestra. Se ve genial la nueva ambientación, le dieron ese tono tan particular que la villa requería. Pero, me quedo faltando ese sabor de "DETRAS DE TI IMBECIL" o "TE VOY MATAR"
My childhood 😍😍😍😍😍
Will this also come to xbox?
Here’s hoping for full PSVR2 support
sheesh
NO LE QUITEN NADA DEL JUEGO ORIGINAL, ni siquiera al monstruo del lago como si fuera un GUSANO cualquiera, ni el U3 (IT), ni el perro compañero....tal vez las rocas asesinas si para que el remake de RE5 no vuelva a perder el control con las rocas XD  y las patadas de Van Damme con ondas expansivas no hacen falta aquí si realmente se busca sentir vulnerabilidad. Si se mantiene a todos los enemigo, personajes y con todos los escenarios RE4 remake ya sera perfecto. Ojala Ashley tenga un minimo sentido de supervivencia y pueda huir por su vida o arrojar un florero como cualquier ser vivo. XD   Quiero volver a entrar a esa cabaña extraña con un habitante hostil por primer vez, asustarme con la primer plaga bajo la noche lluviosa, escuchar la respiración forzada de los regeneradores y todo lo demás con Leon al mando.
Yes they finally made a remake of resident evil 4 after 17 years yes can not wait to come next year 🤩❤️
Where are my villagers?  "Look out behind you imbecile"
Leon: I want to forget about the pain, this time could be different Dr Salvador: hold my beer you son of a b…
Yeeesssss
and why wasn't Veronica's code made??
I can tell already they have ruined it
Oleeeeee!!!
3.23.2023 Its like hearing that hearing that your oldest friend is moving back to town.
I can't wait! RE4 has been my favorite game of all time. I honestly thought they wouldn't remake it but this looks really promising.
Ya quiero que sea 2023 poder comprarlo y pasarlo todo
Yes sir🔥
Only for PlayStation 5???
O ultimo RE jogavel, começo da decadencia. 2 e 3 foram os melhores de LONGE.
Ya puedo saborear ese Remake 😍
looks like it's scarier than the original.☠😱🩸
Y me olvide ojala le dejen la misma voz a Krauser pero puede ser que no 😓
Será para ps5?
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!
don't get cut like RE3 plz
i cn hear the name! LEOOOOOOOOOOOON!
El modo mercenaries ojala lo mejoren bastante
I learnd little spanish in this game. "¡Mátalo!"
el remake que nadie pidio pero que todos necesitabamos :)
STOP SKYRIMMING GAMES MAKE SOMETHING NEW
I hope they don't change the typewriter music  ; )
Keep the combat mechanics similar to the original, or at least as fun and balanced, don't cut anything out, but add to it (Kinda like RE1 Remake) and you've got the potential for one of the best remakes of all time. The OG RE4 is unbeatable in my opinion but I am looking forward to seeing how Capcom handles this!
LEOOON, HEEEELP
Ya quiero ver a Krauser o Los regenerados
trust me a week ago I've played Resident Evil 4 again just for memories, but now I've to wait almost a year to Experience a whole new adventure 🔥🔥🤩🤩❤️❤️ Thanks @capcom & @Playstation
This was just the village. Now just imagine what the castle is going to look like!
My favorite Resident Evil game finally gets a remake😄😄😄😄
IMAGINE GUYS REGENERATOR IN THIS GRAPHICS !
FINALLY
re3みたいに超短縮したクソゲーになりませんように…
Sensing a lot of male duck-facing in the future
It better be camp that’s all I’m saying !
Yo esperaba un Code Veronica con locura.. Pero bueno, tampoco nos trata mal Capcom cierto?
Whoa, they’re actually remaking RE4?
Am I the only one thinking the graphics look kinda worse than the other two remakes? Or maybe it's a slight change of the art style?
Honestly I thought it was fanmade
Amazing game !
Can't wait to see the merchant and hear his voice again. "Welcome! What are you buying? What are you selling?"
FINALLY🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hmm..neat.
This game has been re released so many times its kind of a running joke at this point
La joyita de GameCube por fin tendrá su remake
Look how cute and pretty ashley in this remake.
@ Enis Kirazoğlu
Coming out on my b-day!
.....
Wooooooow yes!!!!!!!!
Eu: tem uma voz gritando na minha mente! Amigo: e o que ela diz?  Eu: LEOOON!!!! HEEEEEEELP!
I AM SO HYPED
Help !!! Leon , help ~~~~~
just see the Ada .. ohh gosh that awesome 1:28
I've played re4 so many times it's not even funny lol i might get it on oc so i don't have to buy a ps5
Boooring
باورم نمیشه آرزوم به حقیقت پیوست رزیدنت ایول 4 😍❤️دوران کودکیم داره زنده میشه
ah shoot here we go again
Al fin un remaster y no un remake !
Thank you capcom for making its remake 😭😭
We all been waiting for
If you STILL can look ashley's  underwear, I'm happy😂
This saved the state of play
Vengo del futuro, van a quitar enemigos
I feel like I'm only one that doesn't care about this lol horror games ain't scary there just boring same with horror movies
Por lo que más quieras Capcom, recompensanos con la duración y deja el modo mercenarios, no la cagues!!x favor
Wesker ya GK botak kah disini
I haven’t played the 3rd remake yet
Where is Dino crisis ?
Been waiting years for this. Super excited!
It was about time we got the Goat 🐐 of RE back as a remake. Can't wait to play this gem again.
Necesito las voces originales de los ganados, aunque sean un easter egg. El meme necesita revivir. Si no escucho un "Detrás de tí, imbesil" al menos una vez en la partida... Este juego no será digno de ser un Remake.
Cool! Thank you!)
🥳
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Офигенно 👍
it seems Capcom could teach a thing or two for R*
Hmmmmmm will never play
Eu vou resumir esse remake em cinco palavras: FAI SE FODA PRA CARALHO !!!!!!! Tô animado pro lançamento 😁😁😁😁🎉🎉
The Remake we all have been waiting for 😍🤩
My 1050Ti: Adios
I know everyone excited to see our beloved merchant!
Cuidado con el colesterol de tanto refrito del refrito del refrito.
Whaddya buying, stranger?
6 days before my birthday! Awesome and please be longer not like RE3.
Looks cool. I hope they don't cut any corners this time around, though. Wishful thinking, perhaps.
Soiscool tu te souviens de ce que je t’avais dit pendant ton live Re8 !!, ba ça arrive 😆
Espero no este recortado como los anteriores remakes
Esa Ashley no parece bobita como la primera
I was going to say I hope they do this remake justice... but with their track record of 2 and 3, leaving and cutting content out. I'm going to expect a sub-par experience. Obviously the visuals is heading in the right direction, looks amazing. However, gameplay has taken a generation or two back with prior remake(s). Yes, make the game pretty, but that doesn't mean take more gameplay out as a result. /facepalm
Estiiiii seraaaaa epicoooo!!!!  Alll finnnnnnn
It is comming on PS4 right right!?
now must buy ps5...
im excited like a doggo for this
O no
It's coming to Xbox too right?
Спасибо за новую одежду Ады. Не перестану этому радоваться... qwq
I just want to live long enough to see RE4 on a Holodeck-type device  I’ll play it again then too
Este juego vas a venir muy diferente de la primera historia 😎😯😯😯😍😍😍
So excited, I hope much of this remake.
Nice
This Game Will be diferent
*Mano do céu O Jogo Vai vir diferente do primeiro lançado*
Zettai kaimasu
this look sick
I couldn't have opened YouTube to a better recommendation
They better not give us the RE3 remake treatment.  Bring the heat Capcom
oh boy, cant wait for the latex mods on ada
as long the decapitation is there... I'm gonna enjoy it 😂👌
Gaming legendary era get started 😈🔥😈🔥😈🔥😈🔥😈❤️❤️❤️
*that voice*   "What are you buyin' ?"
一開場就有猛藥 不錯
I can't wait to hear Ashleys call for "LEON!!!" again
Un forasteiro
Ada Red dress where
¡Olé, olé! 🇪🇦
超楽しみにします
Next year : let's remake RESIDENT EVIL 5
Nice
You know people are excited for this game when in 6 hours it already has over 1 million likes.
Yess!!! Another Reason to liveeeee❤️❤️❤️
Whaaaaat
¡Morir es vivir!  As much as I like this serious approach, I still hope they keep some of the goofyness. 😀
re 4 have a lot of enemy variants, i wonder what they will looked like in this remake.
ну вроде бы ничего так ) надо будет заценить)
I hope they dont mess it up once …. again …
The hype is real
Yes! My husbando is getting another remake on his most famous game!
¡Bien!
It's about time!!!  NOW give us Code Veronica,.Zero.and RE5...
Next one resident evil 5 remake
The return of a legend!
LA HYPE EST A SON PAROXISME
We are gonna heard again the LLEEEEOONNNNN HEEELPPPPPP!!
Sad that PS4 is already being left out but if you think about it, maybe it was for the best so Capcom can maximize the hardware of PS5 to bring us a masterful experience once again. One question though, is it gonna be a third person shooter just like the original? Or is it an FPS this time? I mean the VR feature worries me that it will be just like Resident Evil 7 where FPS was the one they used in favor of VR.
It won't be available on ps4 :((((
I love this game
LFG
Finally !!!!!
Ждём!!!
I'm a bit sad to see that Ada is no longer in a dress
Выглядит потрясающе! Есть ощущение, что разработчики делают все правильно!)🫡
Ahhhhhhhhhh  porfin!!!!  Ya falta poco  !!!
It better be as long as just the original 1 plzzzzzzz don't make it short 🤞😬🤞 but awesome as we get to relive this master piece once again!!
Leooonnn helllppp.... -Ashley2023
I can't wait...😭😭 i am wait for 10 year for remake best graphic thank you capcom
Wait... This isn't a remake?
Finally.... At last it became reality all fans really need this game
El forastero!!!
Apakah Ashley tetap beban :)
Finally!!!
Can't wait to see the Regenerador
Remake 1 already
Morir es vivir... 👀
More anda more remakes….
Leon Helpppp!!!!
El remake que nadie pidió
ES HERMOSO
Now we will have "HELP LEON" in 4k!
Considering there was unfinished content that never made it to final development from the GameCube. Capcom are going to give us all one heck of a long long nightmare playthrough, and of course certain enemies will eventually make a RE4 Remake debut that if a decision could be done. I personally see this RE4 Remake becoming the true master contender for game of the year for 2023. Also as it only right from Capcom end to give us a taste of horror preview gameplay before the end of the year. I have great anticipation as everyone else will feel that this Resident Evil classic is going to be a flawless victory.
What a way to Start of State of Play.
I just want Nick Apostolides to reprise his role again! He was great in RE2 remake and infinite darkness!
I don't know why but capcom is the only video games companies that doesn't let you down
Ashley : Leeeooooonnnnnn Helllllpppppp
Ah yes, a remake of a game that didn't need a remake. I hope it's better than previous two half-assed remakes
why are all the comments in spanish?
The trailer gives a very serious vibe. I hope Capcom doesn't change the tone of the original, the cheesy camp is part of why the game is a classic
Eu ainda continuo achando desnecessário um remake de RE4 pelo menos por enquanto. Acho que antes dele deveria vir o Code Veronica que esse sim precisa de um remake.
I already know this is gotta be scarier than the original re 4 just hoping it’s as long or is longer than the original. Re 3 dropped a lot in ranking because of how short it was
I hope they keep the melons animation, if you know what I mean...
No me creyeron... Pensaban que estaba loco Mi momento a llegado
Tener que proteger a la weona ql de nuevo, pero lo haré mil veces solo por escuchar "watareyuballet" and "watareyuseled"
I really hope the amazing atmosphere is still there, it's one of the best in gaming history.
Didn’t think capcom would remake a game instead of remasterd the game
У меня встал.
Thought i wasn’t gonna be hyped of games for a while after elden ring then this trailer dropped
Am I the only one who noticed Leon and Ashley are in their 3.5 outfits?
yean can't wait to get screamed 'leon help' again for the thousandth times again
el mejor juego de la saga ha revivido que alguien me pellizque si es un sueño ( gritos de perra loca )
I’ve never been so happy In my life 🥲
I love the fact that they are remaking them all, but have they completely forgotten about RE1?!?!
What does Xbox have again, something gamepass?
Where that Leon muscle come on he’s not re2 no more 💪🏼
My body is ready
I'm just doing it, I'm going all hype in! I really want to. I've been a fan since the beginning, and obsessed one and I can't wait to see this
Este fue mi primer resident evil que jugué 😍
15 fps?
Ps5 controller has gyro. We can still waggle.
Day one!
My prediction is that it doesn't live up to the original. 2 Remake was a weird moment where the remake recaptured the insanity and tone of Resident Evil 2 but with better hardware.
Thank you, PlayStation!
Ahora sí quiero mataaaaaar o me voy
This has made my year better. It'll make next year the best!
only ps 5? 😢
Code Veronica better be next, it's one of the most underrated resident evil games ever.
LETS GOOOOOOO!!! Then remake the very excellent cooperative experience that RE5 is. That would be incredible.
I hope after the ps5 it come to the ps4 version
I don't think this game needed a remake as much as RE 1 , nevertheless I'll definitely buy it
Somehow I feel like the remake will be a worse game overall and lose the original's unique tone.
Wow no way the best Resident Evil Ever
mi videojuego favorito, espero este epico el remake
Please don't try to remake the entire series. These are soft remakes, okay. But don't call these canon over the OG.
i am waiting for this game just to release the dog from the trap.
I can't wait to hear Ashley screaming: "Help me Leon!!!"😂❤
Ada and pants? No way.
почему Эшли выглядит как азиатка? - в оригинале и новом фильме она была более милая и европейской внешности
Wow
👍
Era necesario el flamenco que no sonaba en el original? Lo demás un 10
"LEEOOOOOOON, HELP!" -Ashley
Dios!! 😍😍
Will this be launched on ps4?
One of the Greatest games ever made is going to get a whole lot better. Praying this overachieves expectations
A remake that I'm sure everyone will like but nobody asked for.
Ah .... Ada outfit already a lost for me 1:27 Why would they change iconic things
No puedo esperar a volver a cagarme del miedo con Los Regenerados
This better still include Seperate Ways and Mercenaries mode
So happy 😍
All of my money.
Mix feelings about this.
I kind of wish they'd do RE1 or Code Veronica instead. I'm one of those people that found RE4 to be far less enjoyable than the original three games
Amaaaazing memories....It was the best looking game on Gamecube
I hope dino crisis remake
CAPCOM: "How many times can we get them to buy RE4?"  Me: "Sir may I have another?"
Looks gorgeous, but I actually think the original still holds up amazingly well lol
Can't wait to see Albert weaker scenes
"Leon's brown sheepskin leather bomber jacket appears with permission from Schott NYC." This is going to be on Steam, right?
🗣🗣
"LEON HELP!!!!"
I hope they wont censor the lines from louis like facebook did 😄 We need some fun back in video games, keep it true to the original:)
The Regenerators are going to be on the horror level of the Baby from Village.
Lastima que solo va estar para ps5 nomas
Vou poder Reviver minha infância!😃 Não vejo a hora de ficar xingando a Ashley e mandando ela parar de gritar "Leon Help"
"Huehuehueha!, What're ya buyin'?"
This is the best game I ever played & still playing until this day… just scares me how the boss fights gonna be like 😫
¡¡¡WELCOME!!!
RE4 didn't need a remake. Watch it be worse than the original.
I swear if Ashley shouts  LEEOOONNN HELP once, I'll throw a PS5 Not mine, since I don't have one
So is this the remake like resident evil 2 and 3?
Я так и не понял почему должны страдать мирные  люди ?
Wow! This 's I always hope and finally!
Я так понял что в России не ждать(((((
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
Cuando sale
Some fixed camera angles will be cool if that's how it's shaping,  dunno about the whole game though, it'll fell alot like 0, to me at least.
Only onps5? Shiiiii
I almost never buy new games on release day, but this is gonna be a play-at-launch-on-midnight game for me... beyond excited
Donde carajos esta el were you buy!!!!
What about Resident evil 1?
Maybe it's just me, but I wish they designed Leon differently compared to RE2 remake buttchin Leon. If you look at Ashley's redesign, it's still somewhat retains anime-esque features. I wish they made a Leon that more resembles the original RE4 cool face in a realistic way of course.
I feel so great right now
mostra mais da gameplay, mas que trailerzinho furreca porra kkkkk
All we need is RE1 revamped and my childhood nightmares will begin again lol
Thank you so much Capcom for making this legend years later.😭
Need a PS5: "not enough cash, stranger!"
semoga ps4 masih dapat
IM LITERALLY FREAKING OUTTTTT
LEON!
Wait. Is it Matt Mercer as Saddler?
Wow!!! 😲😲😲😲
I caaaaaaaaame
I am disappointed, whoever needs this? RE4 og being the game that was released on most systems, now they just spit on it and move on? Also we have the HD project, and they just make it worthless too? 8 freakin' years, and now it's nothing?
REMASTER 5 PLEASE 🙏🏽
They better not cut any corners with this one..
I really love RE4 but it's already playable and it's not bad at all. should have remake Code Veronica
Resident evil 4 is the only one I’ve never played. Looks like I’ll finally have played all of them once it drops
no se siente bien ver que el titulo se parece al de RE7, RE8, 2 y 3 Remake.
espero q tenga harta rejugabilidad ya q eso fue lo q me encantó del Resident Evil 4 original :D
why i hear everytime "help me leon" lol :v
Eh the novelty of these remakes is over after the second one for me
Shot the water
I need help stranger's is this game coming to ps4..
Finally it is announced. Re4 remake. Welcome back Leon Scott Kennedy.
Lo esperaba reviven lo mejor de la saga RE
Glad they changed Leon's character model. I hated his and Claire's design, especially Claire.
The PlayStation the best on world game
I love this game. I would love to play this remaster
Espero un buen juego de está nueva entrega del remake mi tía en paz descanse ella fue la que me metió en esta saga de resident evil y fue el primer juego que me enseñó a jugar sería muy lindo revivir esa infancia en este nuevo título :')
このクオリティでアウトブレイクお願いします🤣
o melhor resident evil agora foi refeito ✨
Me: Where is Resident evil 4 remastered? Sony: Ai esta
Espero esté la opción de mercenarios y pueda estar HUNK. O revelar si Mike el del helicóptero que nos ayuda si era el o no. 🥺 Diablos como quisiera ver a HUNK de nuevo.
Yes
UN FORASTERO!!!
Not gonna feel the same without Paul Mercier as Leon's VA for RE4 Remake.
Wait Till Dante Ravioli Hears About This
I can't wait for Resident Evil 7 and 8 to get remade!
He vuelto a recuperar la fe en el mundo
I hope this time Capcom give us a background about Ganados, children, Salvador... Well, all the questions let unknow on the original game.
Wuhuuuuu cant wait🔥🔥🔥
Solo espero que este remake no lo estropeen como lo hicieron con los remakes del 2 y 3 y que sean fieles a la historia
acabo de nacer de nuevo!!!!
cant wait to see the lake monster
I wish Leon has the old voice 🤦🏻‍♂️💔
"Hehehehehe....Thank you"  - The Merchant
That bad i think i cant play as Ashley or ada. Only leon xD
“What are ya buyin?” This.
Let's Goooo !! 🔥
It's not the that we wanted but the game... that nobody needed
IM GOING TO CRY
¡¡Un forastero!!
¡Agárrenlo!
OH MY GOOOOSH this is incredible. Im super excited.
Vocês acabaram de desenterrar o tesouro de infância de milhões de pessoas
Valley of something right link
day before my birthday i know what im copping day one 😏
Increíble hasta dieron la fecha exacta del lanzamiento eso me tomo por sorpresa aunque sea hasta el otro año pero si me tomo desprevenido que hasta dieron el mes y el día pensé que solo dirían en 2023
Este si se ve más terrorífico que el 4 original, lo espero con ansias 😏
Thanks capcom
They ditched the RE Remake 2 Leon design. lol
А почему Леон толстый такой?
no code veronica x?
Yo lo prefiero jugar en ps4
Sony c mamut con la exclusiva me dan ganas de comprar la PS 5 pero si fuera eso esperare para ver si realmente lo amerita y también ver si se quedara como exclusiva en caso de que no me convenza o no se quede como exclusivo para siempre esperare para ver  si después sale para PC.
voy hacer picadillo
Espero no la caguen el 4 es mi favorito
If I can’t peep under ashley skirt, it’s a bad game.
I hope it still retains the action oriented gameplay of OG RE4.
I straight up creamed
Eventually in 2025 we'll get extreme testosterone fueled boulder punching action remastered
Love this back then can't wait for it to come back , the best game I've ever played
Ojala q salga para ps4 también 😭
easily the best game of the entire series super excited for this.
Bro this have the potential to be the scariest RE game if it’s done properly
AAAAAAA  RESIDENT EVIL 4 🥳
I remember this being a lot more yellow
I’m guessing Ashley got nerfed if you know what I mean
Will they make it more horror-oriented or shooting-oriented, is the question. Tho, I do am excited for the game. Besides, RE4 indeed is a masterpiece at its release. We'll see.
- Got some rare things on sale, stranger! - What're ya buyin? - Ah! I'll buy it at a high price! - Not enough cash, stranger! - Heh heh heh... Thank you!
There it is dude.
It's not a remake. It's confirmed it's a reimagining.
A nova modinha agora são os remakes! Os estúdios não tem mais criatividade...
Please don't mess this up Capcom like you did with RE3 Remake
Holly bananas. This is unbelievable!
NO LO PUEDO CREEER AMIGO NME ESTAS HABVLANDO EN SERIO????????????????????????
Conque no recorten mucho contenido del juego como lo fue el remake del 3, todo esta bien.
1:16 PS2 Polygons on the skulls? Dang! i thought it going to be a Next-Gen Graphics 💔😒
ждём!
AMK bi gow gostermediniz
looks generic and bland, keep it up with the remakes guys, very original.
เชี้ยยย ขนลุกมาก ภาพแม่งอย่างสวย!! ตำนานกำลังจะกลับมาอีกครั้ง 😱
Some people were waiting for "Code Veronice", not another game where Leon is main character. Okay, let's see what this game provides.
imagine Del Lago, Dr. Salvador, Bella Sisters and El Gigante in The Remake
They might as well just cap it off and remake RE1 and Code Veronica too
Great, but no version for the console where the original re4 was created for. NINTENDO😥
Espero y no la cag3n como con resident evil 3 remake 😒
I think I just came a little. 🥺
I hope this version it's more serious and scary, the original was fun but very goofy and more of an action game.
I love that it's going to drop on my birthday
هرمنا من اجل هذه اللحظه
Bro el primer juego que me llevo a él mundo del gaming,lo juegue en la Gamecube y me lo e pasado más de 6 veces,hoy es un hermoso dia
wow
Só faltou o cara gritando "UN FORASTERO!!"
What a great announce, I hope the game keeps the legendary phrase: "Detrás de ti, imbecil"...
I still play the original often, will be weird not having tank controls and it looks like they are using RE6 Leon 🤮? I’m not for sure, but it sounds like a different VA from OG as well, tragic. I will definitely play this, just don’t expect too much.
Years after years hopping to have Dino crisis again 😩
It's hard to describe to people just how groundbreaking the original Resident Evil 4 was when released. It came completely out of nowhere and far exceeded everyone's wildest expectations. The best version is on the wii with the motion controls as they meshed well with gameplay and it was always hilarious when you messed up aiming your guns due to fright.
Solo espero que sea fiel al original, por favor.
I just have one request, make Ashley more useful. 🙏
Ain’t no way ain’t no way ain’t no way ain’t no way ain’t no way. I’m so excited
フォォォォォォォォ！！！！
Let's hope they get the Spanish right
Obg Capcom, Reviveu minha infância 😩😩
Un Forastero!
morir es vivir
honestly can't wait to see how the game is going to look
I'm interested to see what they'll do with Ashley.
This should be the last remake. 5 was meh, and didn’t even bother with 6.
siluman poni lempar is back
Então a Capcom resolver fazer OUTRO remake do R.E 4 pra tirar mais grana do povo  e nada do remake de Dino Crisis. Parabéns mesmo pelo trabalho. Fala um reimagination nesse também, igual aquela merda do RE3 que vcs fizeram.
бля осенью че нельзя было ? либо не показывали бы до зимы
Holyshit I’ve been waiting for this
- Atrapenloooo - ¡No dejeis que se escape! - Te voy a hacer picadillo
1:57 the new ashley is cute but i hope she less annoying in the game.. 😂
Ashley annoying : Leon. Leon. Help me Leon!
This will be one of my best reasons for investing in a PS5, I’ve waited years for this remake to finally get announced and to experience at top quality
来たー！
I can't wait to see on how many content they will cut on this remake. xD
take my money
Mi dinero 😢😢😢
Where's that classic cheesy action movie tone? Feels like this takes it a little too seriously for what RE4 originally was.
No se si escuché bien pero León dice al final q esta vez eso que sea  diferente  Un mensaje oculta que Da entender una de dos que el juego será diferente mejorando el tema del survival y menos shooting o que será igual como el original pero con mayor dificultad que no quiere decir q sea más survival, no creo q de ese mensaje dando a entender w será un juego corto como el 3  Se viene algo épico tengo fe, tendré q comerme el.orgullo y comprar la ps5
พี่เอกจัดแน่นอน100%
Salvare a ashley 100 veces mas
Woooow!
I can see what Internet is about gonna do to Ashley in this remake, i don't really like it.
Ereto estou 🧟‍♂️🤪
Look forward to the gameplay, hopefully with the failure of the 3, they must be taking this 4 seriously.
Go Capcom go capcom 😎😎
Se nn tiver os ganados gritando "UN FORASTERO!", "ALLÍ ESTÁ MÁTALO!", "DETRÁS DE TI, IMBESIL!", "MORRIR ES VIVIR", "EEEH ACÁ!", "AGARRENLO!", "TE VOY A MATAR!" eu nem jogo meu parceiro! Nem jogo kkkkkkkkk
O medo que eu tô de cagarem meu jogo favorito 😓😓😓😓😓
Maybe I'll live just long enough to see a RE5 remake
I can already hear it.... LEOOON... HEEELP...
LETS GO LEON NATION
Leon coming Back lets get it and we bout to body some zombies
Remasterizaran el resident evil 5?
This looks very promising, heres hoping is more like 2 remake than 3
Wao Ps and capcom yea yea yea . ......
POR FAVOR NÃO CAGUEM ESSE JOGO COMO FIZERAM COM RE2 E RE3!
Hoy murió el mundo del gaming
A minha infância diante dos meus olhos ❤❤❤😭
ojala quede el presidente español Sebastián Piñera
Since we got burnt last time with the Re3 Remake. I heard rumors that this one ends at the village fight.
Oh cool. An already perfect game is getting the watered down treatment. Nice stuff.
OMFG!
Esta demasiado espectacular, superaron mis expectativas. No puedo esperar para jugarlo. 20/20
A lot of ps5 games but a shortage for consoles🥺
el diablazo, que maldita vacaneria, namas falta el remake de la most wanted
Not a big fan of the new voice actor for Leon but I'm really excited to see how the game looks and plays
Another remake?? Lol
Esto va a ser épico papus
I hope they  make it super scary
I only have one question :- have much is Ada's bikini outfit DLC gonna cost?
I get that the script will be updated, and dialogue will be completely different   But please, tell me they'll keep such glorious lines like "Your right hand comes off?"
After RE3 remake I'm very cautious about this
a
the jacket better stay this time
que padre
It’s going to be so fun and scary playing this on PSVR 2. Can’t wait!
No more RE remakes for me unless it’s on sale.
can't wait to face to face with Dr Salvador and of course Regenerator. That was enough to give me goosebumps on my spine..
You got some big shoes to fill...
half of those comments are spanish
Se viene una obra maestra damas y caballeros espero que Capcom vaya a respeta el contenido original y ponga otro nuevo contenido de juego
Ps4 ?? 😭
Can’t wait to see Ashley’s ballistic in Ultra 4K.
so many emotions. my favorite game of all time!
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah let´s goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Now capcom should do all the dmc games like this💯
Man, I can't wait to be traumatized by Regenerators again... now in 4k!
Nossa pelo gráfico vai ser o melhor resident da franquia
Un forastero!!!
I can't wait to see the "What are you buying" guy!
The release date supose to be 8.15.2025, to put a perfect balance between the original game 20th anniversary, and the 30th anniversary of whole franchise.
acabam de matar a infancia de muitos
“Viva Resident Evil 4 once again!!!!” - Luis Sera
Paul mercier voice for leon?
This is masterpiece
Capcom, por favor, trate isso com o maior carinho possível
Woooooo...
man, this is the one resident evil game that I feel shouldn't get the remake treatment. I knew it was going to happen but I think the game's campy nature is going to be completely lost in this one and that's most of the game's charm. I don't know, prove me wrong Capcom but I'm totally fine with just buying the original game over and over and over and over again on the next console you release it on.
I hope this have VR mode too
Ojalá Ubisoft haga lo mismo con el remake del primer Assassins Creed
Que guapa se ve Ashley, a ella si vale la pena cuidar
Todos nos hemos vuelto a reunir aquí. Todos aquellos cuya adolescencia fue este juego y le daba qlo el vato de sierra jajaja. Dios, qué hermoso. Vaya día más cool con Stray y esto.
Gracias a Dios no le cambiaron la raza a nadie
PRL Im Coming
Ojalá también se acuerden del re5
I believe in Capcom this time. They will not cut contents, they will expand it
I’m excited.
Aaaah I'll buy it at a high price!
Re5 remake. Next 😍😍
This was really exciting to watch. Thank you Capcom for bringing RE4 back in all it’s next gen glory.
Did I just saw the re4 remake
This remake makes me wanna live.
Leeoonn.... Help.... 😂
Melhor que GTA 6 haha
THEY USED A DIFFERENT VOICE ACTOR FOR LEON
Resident evil has been having it's renaissance lately, the remakes have been fantastic, and RE 7 and 8 were amazing new entries
Luis sounds like Eddie from stranger things 😂
Hope they don't mess this legendary up like they did to Re3 Remake
The beginning looks like Tristram in Diablo 3.
Confirmo que varios crecimos con este juegazo y promete mucho por las imagenes presentadas. Solo espero y no nos den una version mutilada en cuestion de historia como en el 3 y que al menos nos den una buena re-imaginación a la historia original. Y otra cosa esa ashley se ve mas hermosa que la original <3
And when RE Reverse?
I'm so happy :))
Not usually a resident evil fan but I know this game has to slap. From what I understand, this game defined an era and subsequent games tried to be it
sony is releasing spiderman on pc   and RE4 remake
I guess it'll be on next gen only...
No puede ser que un trailer me haya puesto tan manija lpm!!
Why is there so much bean in this comment section
Después de jugar a esto podré morir en paz al fin.
Poni lempar is BACK
AL FIN QLIAO VA A SER MEJOR DE LO QUE ESPERABA
It's release on my birthday date. Makes me really can't wait for that game to be release.
Alright so now we wait for 5 remake
I WANT MERCENARIES MODE WITH ALL OF THE CHARACTERS FROM EVERY RESIDENT EVIL MERCENARIES MODE!!!!
We need a ps4 version too because there's no post here if someone selling it their price is too high like 70to 80 thousands rupees Make par version too
canmt wait to hammer this on  a 3080 @ 1440p 270 hz
Ballistics incoming
Not on ps4?
So is it ps4 and 5 or just 5
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't they remake this one twice already?
All I want to hear is: Hello stranger!!!
Only ps5?
Un forastero.....😂
I feel off right on the bat with this somehow. Not because of original RE4 sake or RE3 Remake sake. Just...something's not right down the line. It gave me goosebump.
Just wooooow 😍😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
Estoy alucinando 🤯
una cagada el trailer sinceramente esperaba mas minimo un minigameplay
I really hope Ashley actually dose something cool in this version
whaddyabuyin..
I grew up watching my dad play, and beat this game over and over again. I CANNOT wait to experience this again!
Sony, please buy Capcom!!!
Hmmm WELCOME STRANGER
I hope they don't do a RE3 Remake with this
Grande jogo. Um clássico
The best of this state of play so far🔥
Major disappointment if they’re using same voice actor guy from REmake2 (2019) for Leon. Those two voice actors for Leon and Claire were beyond awful. They need the original Leon, Paul Mercier.   Secondly, I hope they update the final boss fight. As great as RE4 was, the final boss was ULTRA-plus LAME.
Hopefully they leave in the laser trap and Leon being able to pose in Sadlers chair
Finalmente siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
IT'S THAT ALL STRANGER? HIHIHEHEHE THANK YOU!     LEON HEEELLLP
YESSSSSSS!!!!
How many times will I buy this game. Find out next time on Dragonball Z!!!
Great now i need to get a ps5. How that will be possible i dont know...
Gostei, vou comprar
Can't wait to meet the merchant!!!
То лучшая новость за себя, на данный момент
CAPCOM: lanzara por fin el resident evil 4  ALDEANO: AHI ESTA!!!
Old memories when we out of ammos 😅
Que te cuesta Rockstar hacer esto? Eh??  Juegazos como el San Andreas, vice city, gta 3 y bully lptm merecen estooo
The legend reborn
Е бой
remake? remaster? all the way
Please capcom dont you ruin the experience for  us
The original was honestly just so goofy, absolutely hilarious and fun to play. This looks way more serious.
アシュリーがポリコレに屈さなかったことを賞賛したい
IN JUST 295 DAYS
Oh my
اخيرا 😍
IM SO HYPED!!! HOPEFULLY IT LIVES UP TO IT!!!
That Great Gfx game 🔥🔥
LOL!!!!!!! 2023?!?!?!?!?! hahahahaha yeah everyone will forget about it by then
Increíble. Qúe momento en la época de videojuegos, se organizaron todos parece
I hope they change the graphic only
I was having an absolute horrible day, then I seen this and now I’m so happy.
I wonder if we’ll still get the same weapons like in the original game or we’ll we get brand new weapons
Que pena que no lo van a sacar para ps4😔😔😔
ITS HAPPENING
Does this mean Capcom is skipping Code Veronica Remake? Please say it ain't so.
Alguien sabe si sale para play 4 o solo la 5
THE BIG CHEESE IS WEARING A HAT
the king game capcom is back
AAaaaaa Leooonn!!!
The real question: Will Ashley be annoying too in this remake?
I want to know how are they going to fix Ashley, hopefully she won't be as annoying to protect this time around xD
Жаль что у нас не выйдет..
I think this looks amazing but here's hoping it doesn't up like RE3.
No es mí juego favorito, pero para cuando el outbreak ?
Welcome back stranger.......
Is it going to be for VR2????? I hope so
is it for ps4????
lol, next gen really doesn't begin until 2023   what's the rush to get a next gen console?
AGARERO!!! (right?;;)
Most definitely NOT buying a game I just bought off steam on sale and completed in sub 20 hours just to pay full price for ray tracing 🤣
hello regenerator my old friend
UN FORESTARO
My body is ready
Why are there a bunch of mexicans in the comments? This is the English PlayStation channel
oleee esa guitarrita,toma mi dinero y sigue tocando
SO, its time to save Ashley once more in high quality graphics. I'm in
solo dejen el juego tal como esta o incluso mas largo y ya, no me lo recorten como el 3
sort of a waste. they shoulda remade CV instead or before 4 remake
im giggling and kicking my feet im so excited
imagine remake Regenerators T_T
Hopefully this time it's an actual Survival Horror game instead of action horror
Si el que vende las armas no dirá: ¡soooooooon rrrrrrrroooooobaaaaaadooooooss!  no quiero nada.
Oh wow this game will be great for the 10 scalpers and 100 streamers that have a PS5.
Capcom I love you
I just had an Uncle pass away… I remember being little and watching him play this on the Ps2… he would be so stoked to see this “Oh yeah I’m definitely getting that.” Miss ya unc imma get it for the both of us.
NOOOOOOOOO
xD espero siga el truquillo de verle las bragitas a ashi en HD jejejeje
Very Nice!!(◍•ᴗ•◍)❤✨
Why ashly's face like this, not like a original game 😢
Will the game lenght be as long as the original ?
Cuando vi esto casi vómito de la emoción
Coming in Xbox series x/s and pc 🔥🔥🔥🔥
code veronica, when?
Seguimos con el Leon con barbilla de Popeye, seguramente se verá increíble y tendrá dos tres cosas chidas, no lo dudo, pero será muy corto y lineal igualito a RE3 Remake. Y no está mal ya que me gustó. Pero va a ser eso, tal cual como RE3 Remake, será como jugar y a la vez ver una súper película de una súper producción de Hollywood que siempre quisimos ver en el cine de Resident Evil, pero no más que eso. Si esperan un juego largo, extenso, argumentado, lento, disfrutable, agotador, cual una buena serie de terror de muchos capítulos, creo que estaremos muy decepcionados.
To arrupiando ate agr
ترا راح تنزل عل اكس بوكس سيريس اكس واس وال بي سي
i hope the will add new stages/new chapters, new cutscenes, new playable character, and new modes.  and the last second on this trailer feels like devil may cry V vibes when it shouting "devil may cry". i know, both r capcom.
El juego que marco la todos (incluyendome) tendra un remake <3 Nuestras oraciones fueron escuchadas.
Why even announce this? If it doesn’t come out till next year? I want to finally hear about some stuff to play this year that isn’t a yearly series.
Saddler: you will receive our most sacred body. Leon: no thanks, BRO.
I am looking for the comment of the legendary youtuber of India Beast Boy
Wow, I love how normal the new villager designs look, or at least how different they are
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
One day after by birthday! This is one of the best video games of all time and an absolute classic. I'm really exited to play the finished product!
Sera canon?
PSVR2!
¡¡¡UN FORASTERO!!!
Clothes on Leon look very baggy. And I guess the idea of game is to look for a girl who can move freely around map? This is very cool!
Shut up and take my money
يا رب ما يقطعون فيها ويخلونها كاملة
INFANCIA <3
I’m so excited ahhhhhhh!!!!!! I really hope they stay true to the original,but I’m still super excited for this remake!
If you can't be called a pervert I'm not playing this game.
Leon, Help!!!
1:58 Wow... nice
Yo queria pa ps4 :'(
This is one of the best news of my life 😭
This is pure happiness 😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥
PLEASE DON'T MESS THIS GAME LIKE THEY DID WITH RESIDENT EVIL 3 "REMAKE"
Where's everyone going.. bingo?
Ps4 ?😥
"Welcome!"!
Dammit capcom take all my money
How about PS4?
all the spanish people flocking in
Is it gonna be released on the PS4 too?
To be honest when I saw th "N" I thought "oh no Netflix, not again!"
😭😭😭
OLLHHHHHHHH GYESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Vaya... Quien diría que este gran clásico de PS2 ya tendría su remake oficial... En la verdad solo espero que esta nueva versión capte la misma esencia y atmósfera característica del material original.  PD: Si los aldeanos no hablan en español y no dicen: "Detrás de ti, imbécil!" no quiero nada xD
And where the f is crouser please dont remove th knife fight
I kind of dig that they didn't modernize Leon's outfit, his pants are straight cut like they were back in 2005
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
How about making new innovative games???? No?
For ps4 please
Deluxe Edition comes with Leon's shampoo and conditioner
They really should have gotten Matthew Mercer to voice Leon again, since he's older in this game than he was in 2.
Saddlers voice is softer than the original
Isso está acontecendo pohaaaaaa
Voy a llorar 😭😭😭 es el mejor trailer que he visto
Where is code Veronica
TIC TAC ⌛
Porfin el mejor videojuego de la historia Re4 tendrá Remake 😍
Terimaksih kasih banyak CAPCOM. Akhirnya game masa kecilku di-remake 😁👍 mudah-mudahan kita diberi umur panjang untuk memainkan game ini tahun depan
new ashely looking cute
I will buy the cheat dlc, please don't judge me I am disabled.
😍😍😍🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷👍🏼😜😎❤️
Resident Evil 4: Back to Bingo
Can we get an outbreak remake or code Veronica x please? Literally no one asked for this
Missed the chance to make the release date 3/23/23
It's time for me to go back to my childhood with this game
I just have this to say: UN FORASTERO!!!
😭
Love
🥰🥳🥰🥰🥰🥰🥳😍😍🙏🙏🙏🙏
惡靈古堡四令我印象最深刻的是艾絮莉的裙底褲。
So no Code Veronica remake? Still kinda disappointed in the RE3 remake..
I don’t know man, this doesn’t feel legit
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Oh yeaah!!!🔥 very suddenly
Bingo
Im excited but somehow i felt like it wont be great as original
I hope they don’t cut anything out like in 2&3 remakes..
The best Resident Evil game, now as a remake? now this is something to look forward to!
I want to BBS play this
Is Ashley Ella Freya?
is that will be available on ps4?
VAMOOOOOOOO TE AMOOO CAPCOM TE AMOOO LEONNNN
Hehehehehe thanks you... Capcom
Yeeeeeesssss
se estrena en mi cumpleaños excelente que buen regalo me voy ha dar
I REALLY hope they made Ashley a lot less annoying in this😒
Cant wait to experience regenerators and iron maidens again
DIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOS
Dang. This is coming out on my birfday!
Pensé que no lo hiban hacer la pregunta es si lo compraría por qué lo he jugado tantas veces me lo sé de principio a fin no se si realmente lo compararía está difícil, a menos que le añadan nuevas cosas hay si pensaría en comprarlo.
Kinda bull that it’s only for the PS5
Shouldn’t it be 4 Resident evil for the title logo? 😂
the graphics, even through significantly improved compared to the original, still looks a bit rough in some scenes and could be improved.
Que bien el remake del "detras de ti imbecil"
This is one of the greatest games of all time... I hope they stay true to the original but also bring back mercenaries mode!!!
Soo hyped for this😎
Disappointed there's no (from what it seems) PS4 release. Guess I'll just have to hope it's also on PC, as I've got no plans of getting a PS5 anytime soon if at all.
yooo
No hay pa play 4 pues :(
idih ganteng bro
Sweet geez, coming from job and looking at this, what a great surprise!!!!!!
hope the boss fights remain the same
I have been waiting a long time to this!
if it's anything like village - I don't want it
LEOOON HELP!
Super excited! But don’t even think about removing the QTEs!
people: RE4 REMAKE OH YEAH🤩 me: SAVING ANNOYING ASHLEY IN 4K OH NO😢
resident evil code veronica is next
me hice pipi
super pumped for when they get to the RE6 remake <3
Now i can curse the girl for slowing my progress and making me spend more bullets in 4K. Yay!
sinceramente se ve bueno pero el resident evil 4 no necesitaba un remake yaque el juego es perfecto tal y como es
Gaming changed after 20 years. I wonder what the remake of the remake will look like 20 years from now.
oh come on! did you really have to change that iconic atmosphere!....this looks like almost every creepy game that came out within the past 3-4 years. Resident evil 4 was always instantly recognizable in every shot.
pls someone tell me that they use the same leon face model from re2 remake. either way, im so exciteddddddd!!!
Please Capcom leave the merchant and have his iconic lines
morir es vivir
UN FORASTERO
KAPAN RILIS! AYOK GUWE SUDAH GK SABAR🔥
Does anyone hope this game will have the same bosses as the original version but better
if i cant look up ashleys skirt i dont want it
0:25 Goosebumps of 2005
almost a year away. you guys can keep it.. i dont want it
Vamosss
llegó la hora de asplastar
YES 🔥🐐
Infanciaaaa uuuuyyuu
They need to not touch the absolutely ridiculous script for this game. "Your left arm comes off?"
I already have it on ps2
I wish it had the original RE4 Leon look.
Finally the time has come
Dato curioso: Los remake de resident evil tanto el 1, 3 y 4 tienen el mismo mes de lanzamiento. Esta si que es una empresa que se compromete. 🔥
انا ماحبيت شكل ليون شكل يعتبر كانه شاذ هذا لايناسبني شكله القديم افضل بكثير من هذا الرسم السيء لماذا رسموا ليون بنفس طريقة الجزاء الثاني انه سيء حقا .
Visualmente está lindo, espero que a Capcom não nos decepcione.
Face of Leon kenedy is stuck in this game.
espero no se cometa el mismo error de resident evil 3 remake , de acortar el juego sacandole escenarios a tremendo juego
hemmm gimana ya?
Finally now they can start working on Code Veronica or Outbreak
I really hope they don't make it to unnecessarily edgy and horror focused. So much of the charm of the original was the goofiness and Leon's snarky one-liners
So wonderful I'm looking forward to it's release in June
A Ashley nessa foto 1:58 tá linda, esse remake prometo
They better not butch it like RE3.
Ashley's new character model: **exists** SFM artists: *it's showtime*
only on ps5? how about pc
SE VIENE LO BUENO
Very nostalgic
Quanta nostalgia a voltar a jogar esse clássico
SIGAN ROBANDO CON ESTOS REMAKES POR FAVOR
yo: no me lo creo  el buhonero: pues te lo crees,ahora WELCOME
Yep..i just waiting for another dose of Ada Wong~
pc gammer here haha i was expecting more graphics changes like resident evill 2 & 3 remastered
How we remember resident evil 4: this trailer.  How it actually was:  “Your right hand comes off?”
Un Forasteroooo!!!!! Version HD
PS4 ? :(
viendo la cara de ashley siento pena la tremenda friendzoneada que le metio el leon
Can’t wait to do that easter egg where the giant monster eats Leon in true HD!!
The Lake Monster is gonna be 10x more scary now
1:18 finally picked Spaniards as Spanish voice actors.
Nem fudendo cara...... Esse jogo vai ser foda!!
SIAPA YANG MERINDING GAESSS!!!!??
¡empieza a rezar!
UN FORASTERO!
DEJENME PRE ORDENARLO DE UNA VEZ !!!
Será el mejor remake del año el mejor video juego de la franquicia de Capcom  EL JUEGO DEL AÑO SERA DE LUJO 😎❤️👌 LEON SCOTT KENNEDY 🇺🇲 reviviendo recuerdos bellos
I swear if both Ashley and Ada dont have "ballistics" ill buy the PC version just to play with mods. Also I dont like the new voice actor for Leon. The original Voice Actor was perfect and they should have waited until he was available or willing to voice this iconic character. Either way looks amazing and I will be playing the original this October to prepare myself for the remake.
The remake I’ve been waiting for since they started remaking these!! 🙏
Ostia tío, esto será flipante!! Ya tienen el nombre Español "Resistente Maldito en la Iberia a todo gas"
SIIIIIIIIIIIII
BROOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! THE BEST GAME I'VE PLAYED AS CHILD IS BACK!!!! If capcom decides to cut some parts as they did with RE3 remake they're gonna take the big L  Game graphics looks sick can't wait to see how it's gonna look like in PC with rtx on
I guess the graphics and models needed to be redone the ground up since the lawsuit they had last year about them stealing someone else’s graphics data and not properly get it through the right channels
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
¡Cógelo!  ¡Cógelo!  ¡Cógelo!
ashley looks so different than the ps2 version, she's so cute
Ashley gonna have her school girl outfit as dlc. Ada hopeful to have her side missions. And mercenary modes
Where did everybody go...bingo?
yoooooo
Este juego me lo pasé cuando era pequeño, teniendo 10 PUTOS AÑOS, me demoré 1 año, no entendía ingles, pero joder lo hice. No puedo expresar la felicidad que siento por el remake.
i am not really excited after what they've done with RE3
"Un forastero"
幹 這炒飯我還不吃爆
please stay true  to original
That’s awesome that they are remastering it but why are they waiting a year for it
Morir es vivir, morir es vivir
ngl, this looks kinda bad
Que increible 🤩🤩 …aunque hubiera esperado un poder grafico mayor para Playstation 5. Pero bueno seguro estará increible!
"1998... I'll never forget it..."
Não tem mais o que inventar aí fica fazendo remake de jogo antigo.
I'm a little disappointed they should remake CODE VERONICA before this! 🙁
Oh boy they're gonna cut alot of stuff from the original for sure
When is it coming? Please tell
Detrás de ti imbecil 4 remake!! Is back!!!
Ojalá venga con la opción de elegir la vestimenta clásica como en el RE2 remake 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Wow that's what fans want
Leon Kennedy corte C. Tangana
Exclusivo de PS5 PlayStation Ganó 😎
happy pride month to me
Uhh finally a real hype begin
Creo que le quieren dar un toque más oscuro que el original que era más balacera de gratis
Aprendeu Rockstar
Was hoping to see the chainsaw dude in the village.
I hope the game still has its action elements like stunning enemies and then punching them.
Abang poni lempar makin ganteng
What's with the verdant forest?
And people where thinking it will be the cut content which had a mansion and a zeppelin
Ayudaaaa, me enamoré de la nueva Ashley 😍...
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BABYYYYY LETSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Love the spanish guitar, SO HAPPY THEY STUCK WITH RE2 REMAKE LEON
Excited about this one!!
Como PS5 no tengo con la Wii me entretengo
I mean…this game didn’t need a remake but ok.
Our leon is back? 😳🔥my childhood
Ps vita
Resident evil Village but set in Spain, dude they didn't need to remake RE4, it is a perfect game already, and now they probably going to do some suspense and horror stuff that wasn't the key aspect of RE4, but okay, guess will have to wait and see
Ehhhh I like the Spanish guitar at the beginning of the teaser but I get the feeling that this game is going to take itself much too seriously and we won't get any of the charm of the original, I'm hoping I'm wrong but I can't shake that gut feeling.
Capcom... Please... Do NOT ruin this masterpiece you had created.
REMAKE ?
Hope they bring back Jarl Balgruuf to voice Saddler.
If I could just have Code Veronica X
Trust me, you guys will pay for this even thou you already play this for thousand times. Greatest survival horror game ever in my opinion🙌
Man, PlayStation win this year presentation hand down
Make Ashley MORE annoying, please!!
Yup I’m buying that
Will it be compatible with PS4? I cannot wait defeating Salazar again on this remaster, still remember the desperation in beating him
It’s cool, but was REALLY was hoping for Code: Veronica before a RE:4 remake!!
and no RE8 DLC, what a terrieble franchise
PS4 por favor
Here it comes! The REAL Village. 😏
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
optimize the game like re3
Espero sea largo como el juego original y no le corten nada, recuerdo pasar horas en el ps2 jugando ese resident y saltando como kanguro cada que esos aldeanos locos te decían en las orejas TE COJI..!! HAHAHA
Falta Code: Veronica
Morir es vivir...
I JUST HEARD A PODCAST SAY IT'S GONNA BE "WOKE". I DONE HEARD THEYS GONNA MAKE THAT THERE MERCHANT IDENTIFY AS AN "AMMO-SEXUAL"!!!!!
LEON, HELP!    4K 60FPS
Hopefully they didn't axe the suplex.
LETSGOOO
Yessss
this is only on ps5?
UN FORASTERO
will there still be zombie Napoleon?
Aaaaah
I was caught off guard i had to check this is not april
Ashley won’t be ugly now lol
Si no escuchamos frases como "DETRÁS DE TI, IMBÉCIL!" "AGÁRRENLO!" "TE VOY A HACER PICADILLO!" "UN FORASTERO!" "MIERDA!" no es una remake!!!
Un forastero!!!
ashley's face looks like it was modeled after ella freya
Should have been Code Veronica though
I want to hear "leon helpppp" again
Don't forget the RE4 HD project mod guys! For me, that was like a remake.
Wait is it PS exclusive?
SENHORAS E SENHORES O JOGO DA DÉCADA!!!!! ❤️🇧🇷
*_I LITERALLY CRIED, THAT'S HOW  MUCH THIS GAME MEANS TO ME_*
I hope they don't cut anything that appeared in the original game this time around.
AAAAAH
Este momento de mi vida, se llama felicidad 😭😭
ME VENGO AMIGO ME VENGO
YAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!
This is pure happiness 😭😭😭
Es exclusivo solo para ps5? Osea es muy buena noticia este gran remake, pero y los de ps4 que? 😔
Meme de Fry
EU TE AMO PLAYSTATION
espero que n seja de 3 horas como o foi o outro, pfv capcom, faça esse ser incrivel
i swear if you cut content capcom, dont  make us down
To be perfect, they need to make Ashley SUPER annoying. If we had to suffer through it, the next generation does too!
We have had re4,re4 hd, re4 vr, now re4 remake damb this title has got more versions than gta
Honestly I expected it to look a lot better, graphically speaking
mi infancia reviviooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
1:53 why is leon acting sad doe😂
Recuerdos....esto sera genial!!!
RIP Code Veronica and they better not cut content with this one!
Apuesto 20 dolares a que censuraron los "misiles balisticos"
the PS4
as someone who didn't get to play the original this is gonna be sweet :DDDD
That music in the beginning made me really want to vibe to some Spanish music
Veo que Ada Wong no usará su vestido rojo :(
0:59   RS 4   BETA (3.5)  hoockman map
WHAT AN AMAZING GRAPICH ^_^
Nobody asked for this, but we will all play it.
Let's hope it's the full game and not ruined like resident evil 3.
llevaba años esperando esta hermosura
Why must they used that RE2 remake model ? 😥 Leon looks fat
Mek remake
I'm still playing the PS2 version. A slim PS2 ruined my disk, and I had to wait for a replacement.
Para los que las productoras nos vienen cagando la infancia , esto no puede fallar.
I really missed the vendor.. hope you can still kill him with eggs
Finally this is the one I’ve been waiting for, RE4 has been my favorite game since I was a little kid.
ya puedo morir tranquilo
S2
¡MATALO!
Well this is unexpected and to be honest I don't know what I should think of.
Why are they remaking a MASTERPIECE?!?
Whattaya buyn
Im so ready 😍😍😍😍
Acaban de revivir la infancia :,D
One of my favorite game on *PS2* can't wait to play it again in next gen!
Leooon! Heeelp!!
I really really hope they pull a re2 remake, but better, and not an re3. Resident evil 4 is so big, they absolutely have to go all out
I can't believe in my eyes :'( It's happening
Olha só! Agora sim vem o Ramake mais top! Vamos esperar. Até lá a galera já comprou o Play 5. Koeeee
When they remaster RE5 if they remove the Sheva tribal skin i will riot
😍😍😯
Got some rare?
Que bien regalo de cumpleaños he recibido por parte de Capcom. Joder cómo pienso anticipar este juego por mis huevos.
Help! Leon
Estará en ps4? O solo en la 5?
Hoy revivió la industria de Capcom otra vez ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
amazing!
Mais um resident evil arruinado, com referência á re3 remake e re8, e a lore de wikipédia !!!
leoooooon
👍
Oh no, i think they are ditching the RE4 Chad Leon look and goin with the RE2 virgin Leon model. 😢 Lookin like he's gonna be a lot more serious than the original too, pls i NEED those dumb one liners.
これは本物…？
I'm not saying I'm against it but.. lit got to much free time maybe.. try idk something new..
RangooooooooooO!
Oh boy I cant wait for a re 5 and re 6 remake haha
Leon help
AGARRENLO!!!
I’m so excited!🙌🏼
Porfin un juego que se va a poder rejugar como enfermoo
man we are never getting a code veronica remake
Been waiting a while for this I’ll have to finish my original re4 playthrough to compare them both
This is what Resident Evil should be
Oh no only in PS5.? Waaaa
I mean obviously the VA was gonna change but it was quite jarring when I heard Leon speak. Still super pumped!
no way they just put this only on PS5 tho like why are they tryna lose money....  sad sad
I hope it's as snappy to play as the original one. I feel the last few really made the controls sluggish and weighty for no reason.
This is when it all started going down hill.
Me acaban de revivir mi infancia!!
Take all the time you need Capcom. Just don't cut out parts of my favorite game please.
Plz capcom. Dont cut any scene... like re3...
Yooooo
re2 remake leon, nice.
Part of ada wong is DLC, Well f for u capcom
Базарю, только основываясь на этом ролике Денис Карамышев сделает новую нарезку на канале спустя столько времени. Отсылая на ролик в котором призывал CAPCOM делать ремейки, и что только он будет в них играть.
Now they better remake resident evil 5 my favorite one because I hated 4
I never played the original so I'm looking forward to this!
I can't wait to hear the villagers say "ach, borell" on loop again!
While im excited for this, i was really hoping we would either get Code Veronica or Dino Crisis.
uwoooo manusia paling tamvan come back,btw poninya kurang panjang
mi tio se castro ritualmente en el baño de una gasolinera con un abrelatas y habia sangre por todas partes y le hicieron al conserje limpiarlo y ese conserje era yo
I swear if they didn't do the infamous Ashley screams...
Se ve rarisimo pero le tengo fe
"De tras de ti, imbécil" Please bring that back haha
Soy fanatico de toa la vida de RE4, me compre la ps5 para puro jugar esta obra maestra.
Bruh this game has had more re releases then gta V
I think I'm the only one who hoped for something else... Still, I'm happy for the fans of RE4.
Let me guess.. 5$ DLC for each unlockable costume including Ada Wongs original dress.
Moneymaker for the psvr2 this one. I've never considered buying one before but I'm definitely going to now.
I can't wait for this game and the callisto protocol
So my heart can't take Capcom and Sony
I wonder if they can remake resident evil 0 and 1
Announced like 6 hours after I bought RE4 HD on my Steam Deck.  Oh well , I only paid $5.00 !
Pela primeira vez na história o Jogo Oficial ficou muito melhor q os Mods!!!
I hope they don't change up the character too much.
My friend past away last year  we always waited for this Game...I love You brother i wish You were here to see this :(
não chore cartão de crédito, é só o começo
Updated monsters and bosses and new dark environments here we go 🤤🤤🤤
Onather disapointment🤔?
Can't wait for the censored dialogue!
ME MOJE
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
will be censored trash with california pulling the strings, not buying
One half of me is excited, but the other half is worried it might tarnish the original.
Still won't be better than the Wii version
É REAL 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
daddy capcom can we have an outbreak remake next?
This was the weakest state of play I've ever seen
UN FORASTERO
Tomara que não seja um fiasco como foi o RE3.
Repitiendo el mismo error otra vez. Se encaminan directo a RE6
All new voice actors ?
I always dreamed of the remake of Resisent Evil 4. Now it has became true.  Are we gonna see more of the Merchant, though?
UN FORASTERO
Por un lado me alegra que todas las grandes marcas estén haciendo "remakes" de toda la infancia. Pero por el otro, me da pena saber que se hayan dado cuenta que no pueden crear nada nuevo que supere sus clásicos.
YES YES YES
Aparentemente..."reciclado".Mas espero grandiosamente estar muito enganado,e espero também que seja um jogo q nos faça zerar dezenas de vezes.
Genial, sale a la venta en mi cumpleaños. Espero que este juego no sea tan corto como lo fue el RE3 Remake, tanto que parecía DLC del 2 y no un juego aparte. Por que el remake del 3, si fue muy corto y me dejo muy decepcionado, era bueno, pero no excelente como lo fue el RE2 remake.
WELCOME !!!
This made my day!! It's what I've been wanting for YEARS!!
is this a fan made 🌚☕
🥰🥳🥰🥳🥰🥳🥰🥳🥰🥳🥰🥳🥰🥰
I hope this is availabel on ps 4 too..ps 5 is too fckin expensive😂
why can't they release it on ps4 too 😫
Me at 1:29 Great. The big cheese. Young men and women who haven't played the original: What?
It's fake. Es falso.
Im not liking baby face Leon in re4, hes supposed to be more experienced and confident.
GANADO 4k
hey what about PS4? you dont provide with enough PS5 stock so its a waste this game will exclusively in PS5
Remake or same game😬
Saldrá para ps4?
Merchant: Whaddya buyin? Me: RE4, again!
Skipping over Code Veronica :(.
Por mucho que odiemos admitirlo tú y yo lo compraremos c:
The end of ps4
OhMyGod.......
WOW!!!!!!, This chido goes, I want it to come out!!
wheres the swag with this voice actor and new Leon?
Alguien sabe si va a ser solo para PS5? :(((
Did they stop selling ps4 in India?
The hype level is unmeasurable,let's gooooooo
I CANT WAIT FOR BINGO
"What are you buying" miss that line
He He He He! Thankuuuu!(Merchant)
Anjayyy Leon S.Kennedy
That mother miranda symbol replacement illuminados symbol

Anjay re4

Wow, we're getting this AND the VR port of the original.  what a time to be alive
Semoga asley tidak beban

Resident evil 3.5 Remake !!! Leon jacket
WOOOHOOOOOOO THE HYPE!!!! i hope the game is longer than the original
Lo voy a gozar como no lo puedes imaginar

PLEASE IT HAS TO BE THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL SAME DETAILS 💎
Espero que respeten las voces en español y las frases de “un forastero” “agarrenlo!” “detrás de ti imbecil”

Dream finally come true,,can't wait to see Del Lago the big Salamander in this remastered
Leonnnn help! Help Leon!
the best news of 2022 can't wait 🙌
Will this be coming to ps4?
Se viene uno de los mejores remake  de toda la saga de  resident evil  hasta me esta entrando un poco de nostalgia  al ver el trailer xD    P.D.  si perdiste la cuenta de cuantas veces te pasaste el re4  o sí hiciste entre  otros el desafío de 0% de precisión entonces eres de los míos 😏😏😏
COMO A CAPCOM YA NO SE LE OCURRIO NADA PARA ESTE AÑO DIJO HAGAMOS UNA REMAKE QUE MAS FACIL Y SEGURO QUE NOS SACARA MUCHOS MILLONES
nooooooooo
Is Aidan Gillen playing Sadler? Sounds a lot like him.
Mi yo niño esta feliz. =)
Woow
Maldita seaaaa solo para ps5 no cometan el mismo error que con gamecubeeee porfavor saquen pa ps4 😭😡😡😡💔😭 apenas tengo el ps3  si tan solo vieran mi partida de ps3 de re 4 supieran cuanto amo este videojuego😭😭😭💔
Noway after all this year 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I guess the Spanish music is bringing all the Spanish comments to the top
I'm so surprised about this announcement. wow. so hyped.
Con que no sea un remake como RE3
Me da un poco de miedo e inseguridad pero.... no voy a negar el amor que le tengo a este juego :')
Forasteroo
WOW esto es increíble! Resident Evil 4 es mi videojuego favorito, y me da mucha ilusión poder ver el estreno de su tan esperado Remake. 💕
5 dias despues de mi cumpleaños!!!!
Now just give me an entirely new scenario starring Luis Serra and be done with it. THEN I might get more excited for this.
already played this
no way !
I hope Ashley will be less of a burden this time.
Literalmente el original es una exquisitez de juego, no tendrían nada que cambiar de la historia o los diálogos, más que mejorarlos y tal ves agregar más historia de la que ya tiene, espero no fallen
me alegra haber sido de los pocos a los que le encantaba la misión de proteger a Ashley, ahora con ese nuevo lavado de cara!!!! UUUUFFFFFFFF!!!!!!!
KELAZZZZZZZZZZZZ
Las plagas is back baybee
It was inevitable...and it didn't disappoint! I can't wait!!!!
Who is in the photo that Leon is holding?
Sera solo para la ps5?...
bruh seeing all these remasters has got me hyped for in the future when they remaster resident evil 5 and 6 the coop is gonna be crazy
por lo poco que se vio sera diferente
woooo por fin ahora solo queda esperar, ya jugué el original y lo jugué un montón de veces en mi PS2 y ahora a esperar a este gran juego para volver a disfrutar.
Now I actually need to buy a PS5
Please Capcom, you have a golden opportunity and were talking about the GOTY of 2005, it's not a simple game, DON'T drop the ball like you did with RE 3 Remake.
Ai meu coração
Molilasdidi Molilasdidi ...
As a huge fan of the original and someone who enjoyed the remakes of 2 and 3, this looks intriguing.
Wow is amazing the background so creepy
HeLp Me LeOn
FINALY!!!!!
❤️❤️
I dont know man… this is tough. This seems to be taking a far more serious direction I just hope the campiness is still somewhat intact
Un forastero 🥺
Espero que no recorten jefes u localidades del juego original, como hicieron con el 2 y el 3, mucha gracia.
太香了
I hope  this remake will be better than RE3
Ashley do be looking a lot more like Cheryl from SH3.
Morir es vivir !
Is it really PS5 only though? I understand not having a PS4 version and I get Xbox exculsivity and all that but I'm hoping this gets a PC release.
Nem chorei só fiquei tremendo
Hunk getting his own game too?
Mano... MANO!!!! Sem condições!!!!! Eu preciso de um PS5
Ah Nintendo no le gusta esto 😤 ni a su breath of the Wild 2
No PS4 release?
I want more of wesker, so he better be in it since he was in the original 4.
ashley beban
So this new face of leon is getting a franchise ??, caunt me in 😁👍
aaahhh me acaban de revivir mi infancia 🥲
Put this game on PC and every female character will be modded on Day 1 of release😏
What you buying
Senhores cadê os novos jogos estamos cansados de Remasterizado
Eso tilín
trophies easy rsrsrs please
Ese inicio, ese flamenco, eso es Resident Evil 4.  (No he jugado el original nunca y dudo poder jugar este XD, pero sinceramente el factor Hispano en este juego es lo que le da su esencia y al juego original).
Y ese buhonero donde está!!!! Me urge que me diga “Welcome” ☹️ y que me truque mis armas
Waiting for remake version of: "Detrás de tí, Imbécil!"
Espero estar vivo para esas fechas 😂❤️
esto cada vez se pone mejor
Sure hope that's not salazar va. Not liking the new one so far.
2023? Oh no
So we can hear  Leon! Help me Leon!  in better resolution?
Can’t wait to see that chainsaw guy
Three Capcom games announced during State of Play...something's definitely going on..
Anyone knows if this is for ps4? Or just ps5
Espero nos cuenten mas acerca de Luis Sera ;D
Can’t wait to see how the regenerators look!
Looks like the big cheese is gonna chase Leon like Mr.X. Bitores Mendez even got the hat on.
el hype que tengo 😁
is leon the same model in re2 remake?
FINALLY!!!! BEEN WAITING FOR THIS! FAVOURITE ZOMBIE GAME EVER!
Glad to hear Leon's brown sheepskin leather bomber jacket has been approved by Schott NYC
Ashley gonna scream in HD now
Aceptemos lo que todos realmente esperamos es saber como sonarán ahora los ganados, aún dirán puedes correr pero no puedes escutir??
Ok
É O RESIDENT EVIL 4 REMAKE 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
No tengo palabras para describir lo que siento ahora ...
If they do to this game what they did to RE2, it will be a masterpiece!
Ohhh... is this going to have 3/4 of the game removed too like 3 did?
Daqui a uns 5  anos eu jogo kkkk,tô sem console de mesa por enquanto
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ki foda
Can't wait to watch  "Leooonnn Hellppp" moment 😂
Helpppppppppp!!!!! Leonnnnnnnnnn in my head.
No for 3 hours to beat the game.
I just hope they don't give it the RE3 remake treatment and remove half the game, I expect this to be at least as long as the original bare minimum or I'm not buying
Que bien ahora me falta una ps5 :)
I hope in the remake they add some new stuff like some stuff in the original 3.5 build
Epic game of Capcom 🎮
leon se comió a Ashley xd
Take me money🤩
Luego code veronica ❤‍🔥
Nostalgic!!
Re4 never fails to entertain. I gotta have a ps5 now
It looks alright... I won't say anything until it's out tho
I just hope the parts where I'm protecting Ashley she doesn't scream LEON every second and actually runs from Grenades
Where’s everyone going? Bingo?
Ta re gordo Leon.
will it be on xbox series x
They really seem to be going the horror route in this remake, but i hope they don't forget about the action style and backwards suplexes!
ME CORRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOO
Para.mi era un remake innecesario , pero me ha dado un hype tremendo, este juego la va a romper en ventas ,. Va a hacer un juegaso , mejor que el 2 capaz, espero jugarlo pronto , gracias Capcom
Not anothe LEEEEEEEEON screem....
Eu vou rir demais se esse jogo tiver 50% cortado igual fizeram com o RE3 hahaha
Solo para la Play 5? Uff menos mal lo vi a tiempo, iba a comprar la Ps4, pero viendo los juegazos que se vienen, mejor ahorrare para la Ps5 directamente. 😌😍
Meh
One of, if not the greatest horror game of all time! This remaster makes it looks brand new! I cannot wait!!
I sort of hate how much they're using this "RE" logo. Makes it seem like it'll be no less different from the last two remakes that came out. Remake Resident Evil 5-8 while you're at it.
Please be third person 🙏🏻
Eh? cosa? davvero?
Wow. I honestly thought that was the end of the remakes but this looks incredible.
I hated the original game.
Finally,RE4 was the best in the series
Nice pixels, shame about the tone and delivery being completely off, and if all that pre-amble junk is actually there in the beginning then the game's pacing is already a big concern too.  This is going to be another Resident Evil 3 Re-make, isn't it. :(
PS4
Solo puedo decir!  No la caguen como con el remake del 3 🤔🤔🤣🤣🤣
This gets me hyped asf. I loved the original but playig it again in 4k with updated physics and graphics is just so cool.
É de arrepiar, vai ser lindo demais esse remake!
I’m really loving that it feels very much in line with RE2 remake. The art direction, character model/voice of Leon etc. A true sequel to the masterpiece that is RE2 remake. Love iiiiit
after remake 3 I have little hope in this game ill wait for it
I can already hear someone screaming at the top of their lungs "Leon! Help!"
na posta , este va a hacer el mejor remake si lo hacen bien . ya era hora del remake de esta joya
Rockstar should really learn from capcom on how to make remakes and remasters.
I hope I still alive till the game comes out
Resident 4 en ps2,ps3,ps4,ps5,ps6,ps7 🤣😂
Noice...can't wait to land german suplexes on zombies.
loooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
I wonder if they"ll replace Ashley's skirt with pants in this new version. Leaving her with the original could be "problematic".
Solo espero que sea en cámara de 3ra persona! 🥹
We justed asked for a normal game, not a masterpiece...
Was waiting for this to happen.
Did they changed Ashley clothes? I prefer the original sleeveless one.
EPICO!!!
Esperaba al final el sonido de la motosierra..😈
MANOO
TAKE MY MONEY RIGHT NOW
I wish they kept the original voices
Ahhhh! I'll buy it at a high price
I hope Leon keeps his jacket in the remake
After what happened with RE2, RE3 and Village, I'll wait.  I'm expecting between 20-40% of cut content from original.
Boo that's the best they can come up with, I want something new for $60 plus dollars not something old. RE4 is amazing but it just seems like it's low hanging fruit. Been there done that. Next
My favorite Resident Evil is now a remake. Time does fly so fast. Love how it looks so far 🖤
Este fue uno de los grandes de mi infancia. Espero un gran trabajo por parte de Capcom en este juego!!
👍👍👍👍👍💙
nanananana epico dios
Time for everyone to go to bingo again.
LEON!!! HELP!!
Pria manis, poni lempar, otak mini is back
NAA , AMIGOOOOOOO
Un forastero
LFG
As happy as I am with the news of a remake of RE4, I'm a little worried because I don't think it will make the same impact as the other remakes since the original RE4 had the shoulder cam already. Maybe they could improve the aiming system and probably make Leon moves more agile, but I don't see much of a revolution here and I fear only fans of the original title will truly enjoy this game for the nostalgia. Those who are recent fans will find this remake as just another Resident Evil
I can hear Ashley's irritating voice already...
MAKE A DINO CRISES  REMAKE
Please don't mess this up like you did with RE3 remake
espero que não decepcione a gente🙏
Vuelvo a ver mi infancia otra vez y sé que de muchos también, ya extrañaba la emoción que sentia al jugarlo. Capcom se la juega todo con esta versión, eso me emociona aún más. Ahora solo necesito comseguir un ps5 XD
I FKING NEED IT IN MY LIFE
Sooo excited for this iconic game!!!
Amazing 🤩
so, all the ppl that swear this would happen.,,, uhmm, what about now??
um dos melhores resident
"detrás de ti imbécil" 😮😅 pues a ver que tal, a ver si se animan a sacar el 1 con estos graficos para tener los 4 primeros
After seeing what they did to Resident Evil 3, this is a hard pass until it is on sale for 20$
WELCOME!!
I may see that many fans might think if this Remake could end up like 3 Remake. As a person who follows the development of this remake for a while, I can tell that It will not end up like 3 Remake. This remake originally planned to release last year and it was being developed by 3 Remake team. Capcom saw the feedback of 3 and took away the project from 3 and gave it to 2 Remake team. 2 Remake was developed by Capcom but 3 Remake was outsourced. So be relax. 4 will have 2 Remake treat.
Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Melhor resident de todos.
No la cagues capcom, please.
Great, but I thought the game will be released this year (
So this will not be available for ps4🙁
Finally! Tbh, i didn't expect RE4 will get a remake, because the original is perfect the way it is. Code Veronica or maybe Outbreak is the one who needed a remake.  But a beggar can't choose, so i'll take what i can get. I just hope Capcom won't cut a big portion of the game, like they did to RE3.
Bueno gente hoy triunfo la infancia pero recuerden que es un remake así que lo mas probable es que cambien el "detrás de ti imbecil" por "detrás de ti chaval madre mía que flipo" y muchas de las otras frases.
That one game we all been waiting for 😎
"LEEOOOOOONNNNNN!!!!!!!!"
La ashley en la foto parece más Martha higadera
I wish we could still have the feature, peeking.  And armored Ashley, ridiculous, heavy but usefull.
👏🏻
They should have remade code Veronica it could've been better
TA bueno.,..
Ah..... RE4. The birth of third-person shooter.
Since this seems more like a horror than action, I can't even imagine how much terrifying Regenerators and Verdugo would be.
Too fast.. They dont even change the Letter Style like Original RE4.. another Short DLC
Leon papi ahora en 4K papucho 🤤
Please don’t be bad Please don’t be bad Please don’t be bad Please don’t be bad Please don’t be bad Please don’t be bad Please don’t be bad Please don’t be bad
If I don't see a Mercenaries mode with mega dr salvador imma be sadge, he gave me nightmares.
Mano que trailer foi essa slc 😮😮
y’all can’t make something new???
Ashley looks cuter
Este momento de mi vida, este momento se llama felicidad :')
Sin dudas un digno remake al mejor de los Resident Evils 👏
Why is everyone so hyped about this? This trailer looks really boring. Not trying to start a fight, just confused.
Why?
I really hope that this game wont be bad as RE3Remake
Un forastero!
Finally! They're gonna release the game in more colors besides brown!
I'm all in! Now it's time to redo Dino Crisis, maybe give us a true third title.
Please dont be FPS Please dont be FPS
O_O
Yay, censored game!
Me when the game comes out for 60 or 70 dollars " Ahhh ,  I'll buy it at a high price "
超人卡普空
sera exclusivo de sony?
Finally we get to see Chief village again
Vamos
they better not cut it down like RE3
THIS IS GOING TO BE EPIC 🤩✨
遂に来てしまったか神作品が 皮肉なレオンの性格消さないでね
Hubiera preferido un Resident Evil Code Verónica Remake. Nada mal esto, pero Code Verónica necesita un remake digno
Morir es vivir
But why?
o trailer não mostrou nada do que eu queria ver mais bateu aquela saudade de jogar Resident evil 4 no ps2 S2
Cool. Not that I think it needs a remake, but I'm very excited all the same🤘
Esto será épico 🤩🤩🤩
ESPAÑA
Man I wish they were able to bring back to voice actor from the original to play Leon again! But I have hopes for the new one, hopefully he can be just as iconic.
Amazing!
Made me tear up honestly
LLLLLLLLEEEEEEETTTTTTSSSSS GGGGGGOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!
Coming to ps4?
I really just don't know how to feel about this. RE 4 is nearly perfect for what it is, as it is; it's such a classic but also so recent I don't think it really gets much out of the Remake treatment. I'm cautious; I just know what happened with RE3: Nemesis and im afraid they'll do the same to RE:4 and cut out large swathes of the game.  RE Nemesis has always had a very special place in my heart, and Nemesis jumping out of different areas to chase you based in which areas you've been visiting was so cool and at times terrifying; I'll never forget, when you're about to finally get on the train after you get it working, Nemesis jumping down into the forked path leading to it; I had screwed myself hard by saving right before that, WITH NO HEALTH ITEMS AND AT CRITICAL WITH JILL SLOWED WAY DOWN, and I proceeded to try to game a way past Nemesis while moving so slow for the next 2 weeks. It was such a memorable, unintended consequence of the games style, item availability, and my own idiocy, and I absolutely loved it.   It was such a massive disappointment to see how they neutered Nemesis, reducing him to a set piece who wasn't even as dynamic as MR.X, when I finally got my hands on REmake 3.
"The release is next year. How are you holding up?"  "Bad question, Hunnigan."
Ojala salga en PS4
Morir es vivir….
Gozei… R4…
Al fin qué épico papus ! Quiero ver a esos Regeneradores
looking forward to seeing how the regenerators look!
F***** YEESSSSS
Enough with remake.just keep making a new RE
Ashley looking like Ramón flowers tho
Mientras no la caguen como con el 3.  u.u
¿Qué carajo estás haciendo aquí?
THIS LOOKS BREATHTAKING 😭😭😭 I cant wait!
As long as we can still suplex monks I'm happy.
Why just why
待ってました。
My great old memories. Finally! This is so HYPE!!
Tomara que não cortem muito do jogo como no RE 3 Remake e que mantenham todos os chefes do jogo original.
Looks like it's a lot more serious than the original 4, but we'll see how it is when it launched.
Le cambiaron la voz a Leon?!🤧
Meus amigos! Que dia jubiloso!
NOO WAY
I just realised we will be experiencing the Regenerator in 4K
*"WHAT ARE YOU BUYING?"*
"LEON!!! HELP!!!" will be the real nightmare.
I just peed my pants!
Morir es vivir.....de vuelta al castillo :O !
RE4 It's a long game.. It's only coming out in a year? how much did you cut? capcom? I'm worried about it
私の人生で1番やり込んだバイオ4のリメイクだ…絶対にやり込むぞ…オリジナルを越さなくても良い…だからとんでもない改悪はされないでくれ…!!
DROPPING LOADSSSSSSSSSSSS
Está disponible para ps4? O solo es para ps5
His pants is so baggy, he's like a hiphop guy in the 90's... 😁
¡Agárrenlo!
Resident Evil 4 Turbo Champion edition Arcade
何回やり込んだことか。。。この日を待ってた
I'm hoping they still keep some of that re4 charm tho i.e. "no thanks, bro"
Siuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Osmund Saddleeeeeeerrr
Where are Ashley's ballistics?
I just hope they dont ruin it liek they did with RE:3 and keep it jsut the same but with better graphics
I mean I guess if it sells just keep doing it right? RE4 IS a masterpiece. But uh yo Capcom give us an RE Code Veronica remake next because we actually need that.  This will be great tho, methinks.
Yup... I will play this game again.  I wonder if it will be an action game with a horror tone or if they're actually going to skew the gameplay more horror than the original?  It will be interesting to see and, either way, I'm here for it.
I'm definitely interested on how the Las Plagas parasites would look rendered in this new style and how much scarier it can be. For example the "IT" boss would be essentially a nightmare with all its grotesque body horror. Then again alot of RE4 is body horror with how the parasites crawl/pops out of their hosts. Considering the gore that was in RE2 remake I hope they don't hold back and make Las Plagas as terrifying as possible.
please oh please for the love of goodness gracious all mighty in haven please don't censor the voice lines like Facebook did for vr (or anything else), please oh please. 🤞
Ahhh… WELCOME BACK! Stranger.
Here's a big question. Do we REALLY NEED this? The original Resident Evil 4 still holds up to this day.  If anything, Code Veronica deserves a remake. It really does.
Idk about that artsyle chief
Stop making girls run like that, NO ONE RUNS LIKE THAT.
WOOOW mi adolescencia en un video, ya era hora de este Remake, Capcom no te olvides del Code:Veronica.
Something tells me we will get a remake of 5 & 6 long b4 we get a remake of 1
The nostalgia...
So excite for this awesome game, I'll wait this beautiful remake looks really nice, the castles maybe it's very awesome, and please the one expectative that I have is, this remake need every of re4. Add and no remove, pls.
Why make a remake of a game that was fine the way it was and has like 20 remasters? RE0, 1 and Code Veronica are the ones that need this treatment!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
W
They just gonna be remaking all of the now?
よっしゃああああ！！！
So no one is talking about how the voices are pretty wrong.
I have the current RE4 on my wishlist, but now I'm wondering if I should wait for the remake next year. Not sure if PlayStation will do a free upgrade to the remake if people already own the original.
Finalmente, só venha
The game is already a masterpiece so why remake it again? so after doing Remake up to RE6 they will remake RE2 again but it would be "Resident Evil 2 Remake more that ever"
recuerdo que la primera vez que me mato Dr. Salvador me dio mucho miedo y no lo juge durante una semana jajajaja yo tenia 11 (2007), ahora podre hacer que mi hermanito de 10 años juege esta version jajajajaja. que buena infancia tuvimos
The logo in the beginning looked quite campy also this leon does sound a bit like matt mercer's version
Saudade do ps2 já bateu
УРАААА!!!!
im very happy for that but still the original version is perfect
Espero que consertem aquela bosta de história. Se bem que, né. Capcom.
LEON HELP!! xD Looking forward to this! Gonna need that suit of armor for Ashley
I have one question : please : is resident evil 4 remake is going be also ps4 ?
The nostalgia is kicking in hard. I remember playing RE4 a lot after school when I was in elementary. I'm really pumped to see this remake!
Epic!🔥🔥🔥
This does look interesting, I'd give it that but there's like 3 reasons why I'm not gonna play it.  1: (obviously) Don't own a PS5 2: I'm kind of a chicken when it comes to survival horror games. Yes, that includes jumpscares (I realize how pathetic I am in that part) 3: Resident Evil is kind of not my cup of tea. The only game I've ever played was Operation Raccoon City.
👍👍👍😍😍😍👍👍👍
I just hope Code Veronica is the next game in the franchise to be remade.
Si no quitaron el "Atrás de ti imbécil" todo bien.
I can't help but feel that they could have done a much better job with the trailer. I love RE4, but somehow this trailer managed to not hype me up at all.
La Polla
I just don't see a point in a remake unless they shake up the gameplay in a big way. I would like a survival horror take on RE4.
Vamos lá PlayStation dubla o jogo em português do Brasil!!!
ITS ABOUT TIME :D
Ahuevoooooo!!!!!
FINALLY!
I am very excited for the remake of Resident Evil 4 but I'm pretty sure without a doubt once this game will come out there will be some people criticizing it about certain changes  , different designs or missing enemies well that's because it's a remake not a remastered version of version a Resident Evil 4.  The Resident Evil 2 remake and Resident Evil 3 remake we're fun in my opinion even though re3 was a little short.  people complained about certain things changed, certain enemies we're missing, certain elements missing and different animations in the re2 and 3 remake. The Resident Evil 4 remake may not outdo the original but it will be a Nostalgic throwback to the original.  I just hope they keep 2 of my favorite enemies doctor Salvador and the regenerators.People should play video games to play and not find every little thing that is wrong or they don't like and start criticizing.
Pra PS5 só ??? Tnc
they're cutting out all the cheesyness? not gonna buy.
Mirda
Devil may cry 3 remaster🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐
Están hermoso vivir para ver esto!!!
Me siento tan emocionada. Será genial escuchar la mítica frase, "detrás de ti imbecil" después de mucho tiempo.
?
code veronica?
Hope it's still just as cheesy as the original
Before Code Veronica and RE Outbreak?  Capcom really are catering exclusively to 90 IQ mouth breathers at this point.
😲😲😲
hopefully there wont another tyrant trash chasing or fairies with vampire werewolves
Please don't be bad. This game is already a masterpiece. Don't change too much.
can anyone legally freeze me until 2023
Leon.. HELP me LEON~
I have concerns about this. OG 4 aged incredibly and can still be played without feeling antiqued the way OG 2 and 3 feel (even if they are still great). Those games had a lot of upward mobility for a remake, I am not sure what can be done to 4 without making it worse unless it is just a massive visual overhaul.  We're getting to the point in the old games where they started resembling modern games aside from the graphics.
I can already hear "LEEEOOON HELPPPP"
Queremos la misma mi3rda, pero con mejoras gráficas y mecánicas pulidas. Nada de cambiar o arruinar algo nostalgico
We need re revelations 3
Ah yes now I can hear “LEON! HEEEELLLLLPPPP” in new graphics/HD
Resident Evi REMEKE 5 y 6  pa cuando XD
Sony should be focusing on making the ps5 itself readily available instead of exclusive games because most people still can't get one after almost 2 years unless they're willing to pay a scalper a few hundred dollars over retail
Special Edition PS5 Promo Bundle??
It better not turn out to be like res3…
Looks like they made the bold decision to remove as much charm from the original as they could.
siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii cmsr
🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Is Ashley actually going to be helpful, or will this be Tired Babysitter: The Definitive Edition?
Me dropping everything to watch this .  Others: Wheres he going? Bingo?
welp time to hunt down a ps5
ESTOY FELIZ!! MI CORAZÓN SE ACELERA.... ESTA SENSACIÓN... ES INDESCRIPTIBLE ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ QUIEN DIRÍA QUE 19 AÑOS DESPUES SALDRA LÉON SABROSO KENNEDY EN REMAKE 😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️
ストーリー重視かな？
Yo se que esta mas adaptado a movimientos mas realistas, y un vestido no es lo mas comodo de usar en situaciones asi, pero de verdad se me va a hacer muy dificil ver a la nueva ada wong sin su vestido rojo tan iconico y lo mas probable es que de primeras no me guste, quizas tenga que acotumbrarme para tomarle el gusto pero de entrada me siento un poco decepcionado, opinion propia, creo que me jugo mucho la nostalgia
So awesome!!!
Espero que a capcom não cometa o erro de remover partes do jogo original. Mas sim de manter as partes do jogo original e  adicionar coisas novas
I hope they keep the zombie language
1.) Improve, 2.) Add, and 3.) Preserve. Improve graphics and gameplay that help refine it's playstyle. Add New scenarios never explored or cut from the original game. And Preserve the ORIGINAL IDENTITY of the Game, WHILE being its own game. If Capcom does this and has RE4 Remake on Par to RE1 Remake but in the Graphics and Style of RE2 Remake then this game WILL succeed. If not, then it will fail like RE3 Remake.
Leon is back
No digas mamadas wey es el verdadero tráiler de residente evil 4 que prooooooo delen like si quieren que ya salga el resident evil 4
😯😃😎👍
Never played the original, excited to play this one
Is it me or the trailler kinda sucked?
YESHHH IS THE LEON FROM INFINITY DARKNESS!!!but mix re2remake jaw and nose mmm   Ada took Re6 design mmm okay sad i was hope they stay the original but modify, ashely look mature now sad i was hope she more annoying than original double down the trouble increase the difficulty!!!
Hope they show a bit more of Leon past, before Re 4 events.
Se a Gameplay for como o vídeo vai ser brutal!!
"DETRAS DE TI IMBECIL", Nunca me había puesto tan feliz que me insulten :")
Uff qué riko será escuchar y ver a Luis Sera en 4K.
Two Thumbs up 👍👍
Why Ashly looks worse ?? :/
Yeah!
oh NO shabby LEON!!!
I really hope they don't massacre this game like they did RE3.
Where did everybody go... bingo?
Sera que habra una campañia aparte con el ejercito español
Leon seems a bit too emo in this trailer
Guaranteed masterpiece
Han pasado 17 años.... 17 años que valieron la pena esperar para poder ver a leon de re4 en 4k full hd
Ashley's such a baddie ngl
Regenerator exist : did u miss me kiddo
Siiiiii!!!!!
I almost cried here man... this is the game of my life brow
This makes me alittle nervous not going to lie. Resident Evil 4 has already be ported to every platform known to man at this point. Capcom has a lot to live up to if they want to pull a  remake for Resident Evil 4.
Hmm I guess I cant wait for Resident Evil 5 n 6 remakes too
La música parece compuesta por Javier Santaolalla, esta tremendo.
Ya estoy abriendo el steam verde para descargarlo.
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I hope we see how Krauser will look and his prototype weapon that he uses on Leon
Estube esperando por lo menos un "detrás de ti, imbécil", un poco decepcionado la verdad. Pero aún hay esperanzas en los próximos trailers.
Your right hand comes off?
Beyond hyped
Not gonna buy until it comes out. After that bs they pulled with RE3
Voy a hacer picadinho kkkk nostalgia do PS2 BR
1:11 SUPER BROLYYY
1:57 joder que gran juego
We going to hear plenty of 'LEON!!!'. ..the scariest calls. ..
Please have more costumes, re3’s lack of costumes sucked
pense que era un video de engaño pero pues que bueno que le hagan un remake porque si se lo merece. Aunque creo se saltaron el del code Veronica no?   es muy infravalorado.
I hope they remake the 5th one my friend an I would love to play it with updated gameplay
EU TO MALUCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO AEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Empieza a rezar!
no llegara a pc? cuando re4 es uno de los juegos mas porteados, que se puede encontrar en cualquier consola XD.... F
Ya all talking about how awesome this trailer is but I already got my self shaking thinking how the Regenerator would look like (and hopefully they let us into the military complex in the remake)
Capcom precisa no remake
Finally...... March 24th 2023 😎. The longest resident evil game that capcom ever made. Can't wait to play as my favorite spy Ada Wong 😍 in "Separate Way" 😁.
WOW it actually happen
This is great news. However, I really hope they don't skip CV!!!
I am going to love playing this!!!
Guys. Do not get your hopes high and don't get into the hype. Expect the worse.
Ufff se ve terrorífico!! Pro no me quiero ilusionar
Ps5 exclusive?
Alparecer ada no tendra el vestido rojo que pena😔
noooooooooooooo ps4 :(
Hope this is better than the original. Wasnt a fan of it
🥵🥵🥵
This look tight I can’t wait frfr
楽しみすぎる
que le pasw a la voz de leon
Sorry to say that it will most likely be a flop because it's going to be on the ps5
Hopefully this follows the quality of 2. Not 3.
PLEASE make Ashley useful
Whatta ya buyin'?
Looking forward to this! I hope the Krauser knife fight is better
Are we still going to get Sandy Cheeks yelling out, "Leon!" throughout the game?
I want the dont let him get his coffee zombie….
Can't wait for them to cut a third of the content out, have no mercenaries and be half as long
I'm waiting to see the gameplay since RE4 it's one of the 3 RE that I don't like and in my opinion it's far from being a RE game, the other are RE 5 and 6
(Its gonna be a little repetitive but ) I really hope they make Bitorez Mendez like Mr. X and to pursue you through the village
Solo espero que no quiten el: "Detrás de ti imbécil"
Meh, the beginning of the series' downfall, lifted somewhat by RE7 in the meantime.
Hope we're all still alive by the time this game comes out
They better have the massive kicking
Un FORASTERO!!
Iam very excited to see how they manage the boss like mendez, salazar and krauser in the game
I really hope they don't cut content like they did for 3
Insano rapaziada
Va estar bueno el remake del resident evil 4
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Looks like ps4 games
Ps4 vai ter nn ??
ojala sea iugal de largo que el original, no como el dlc del 3
Is it just me or is Leon's Jacket huge on him🤣
Finally 😭😭
Quero só vê os bugao igual gta trilogy
Cute and Annoying Ashley is BACK!!!
Better have his jacket on all game
Solo quiero que los aldeanos tengan los mismos dialogos!
😐😐😐
no pc? :'(
The best game ever
I hope they made Ashley less annoying.
I look forward to another REmake but I'm still waiting on an Outbreak remake or at least a rerelease.
I think I’ll pass even thou RE4 is one of my favorite RE games of all time! It’s just not the same with these new voice actors they hired Smfh! Wow
Como eu
This looks so spooky!!! The lighting is amazing I can't wait!!!
Só para play 5 ,é golpe baixo para a galera que não pode ter
Épico
Please keep the mercenaries and maybe possibly add coop to it, that's all I ask Capcom
le sacaron la espalda del 4 original y se la pusieron en la cadera? o sea... esta muy culón! 02:04
OMH I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS 😭😭 one of the best RE games ever!!! I’m so excited for this!!!
Solamente espero que salga para PS4 (Si no sale para PS4 estoy seguro que va a arder Troya)
If this doesnt game doesnt have a chainsaw man section im rioting
Cara não são mais os dubladores originais pq não tem como né, mais não consigo imaginar o mercador com outra voz. Sera que vai ser dublado??
Los illuminados...I'm coming for you...
CENSORSHIP AKA Sony Test equals no BUY
Leon 🥰🥰🥰🥰
🤯🤯🤯🤯😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 FINALLY
Looks great but hope it’s long. RE3 was unacceptably short.
Xbox?
Haaa su madre ¡¡YA LE QUIERO!!
NOSSA  ESTÁ   SINISTRO  E  SOMBRIO   VAI SER DA PESADA
TAKE MY MONEY.
Wow. Ashley got a a cute new hairstyle
Well i hope the game doesnt lose it charm that had in te original, the jokes were quite a great thing thst happened so i hope some stay on it, and i hope theres a pack thst comes with the original voices, they were iconic
Finalmente!!!, Realmente esperemos que no pierda la escencia que tiene el resident evil 4 2005.
Aww, they’re trying to make RE4 look scary
Leon! Heeeeelp!
Está remake va a ser una locura podría ser la mejor remake y estoy ansioso jugarlo ✨
Oh yeah..
Please CapCom. Take Silent Hill and revive
Its happening, OMFG.
Heeeeeeeeeeeellp!!  Heelp me Leon!
It is being developed by Capcom Dev 1, responsible for the RE2 remake, we can expect another great remake from them.
LEEEEOOOON!!! LEEOOOOOON!!
Who can’t wait just to watch Markiplier?
Ainda bem que as personagens femininas não estão sexualizadas como no original!! ♥️
My father and I played through the campaign at least twenty times on the GCN back in the day. I can't wait to boot up the console and play through it again with him once more!
Vai ter compatibilidade com ps4. Por favor diz que sim
The Only Remake That Can Match FF7 Remake.  And Probably Prevail.
El que si se merecía un remake de verdad es el Code Verónica. Hacer un remake del 4 es innecesario pero bueno ojalá sea un buen juego y sea disfrutable.
Majestuoso 😍
-Atrás de ti imbécil! *Andaluz music starts playing*
My legend returned
nice) re 8 graphic
Resident evil : keep ashley safe edition... Yay
I’m really hoping they don’t cut tons of content like the did with re3 remake. Just imagine how sick the big chief transformation can look in the remake.
YESSS YESSS!!!! YESSSSS!!!!
No saldrá para ps4 entonces? :(
I just hope it does the original justice. Trailer is amazing but the actual game has a LOT to live up to.
Where's resident evil outbreak 😭
THEY DID THE THING
¡Allí está, cógelo! This is great news indeed.
Como que não ouvimos no trailer a Ashley gritando ao menos uma vez: - Leeeeooooonnnn help me. kkkkkkkk
Today is a great day. Re4 is my childhood, getting this remaster made me smile like a fool child. I'm crying like a Crybaby.
yeyyyy leon is back!
Awantaaaa ¿Será un exclusivo de ps5 ?no me jodas ;-;
Buenas noches ♥️🖤♥️🖤
It's really happening now !!!
Capcom errar agora não e uma opção, um clássico desse merece todo o respeito possível.
Skipping Code Veronica??? THAT game needs a remake over 4
Un forastero
Mo-mommy back?
I might have to get a ps5
Honestly, I was having a really bad day and this really brought happiness to me🥹🥹😭❤️
¡¿Solo para PS5?! Aahhaahahahah no quiero otra consola, me gusta mi PS4, por primera vez quiero que una exclusiva de play llegué rápido a pc.
HEEEEEELP! LEOOOOON!
They're finally remaking this? I hope they updated the controls.
Ganhamo
A hora si se viene lo chido
Can't wait for the Pc VR mod 🤣🤣🤣
Cool guess we’re never getting that Veronica Remake cuz you know RE4 is just the game that kill off survival horror
se nota que esta cara la luz, ta oscuro el juego xd, solo espero poder escuchar el "detras de ti imbecil" xd
Yeeees yes
What are you buying?
No ps4 :(
Cool but I think they should have done Resident Evil one and Resident Evil Zero then 4
Please please please don’t cut too much
Why?
"What are you buyin'?"  Is something an old friend of mine used to say!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
That game is awesome when is coming out?
Por favor, tragam dublado em português também! 🙏🏾❤ Comunidade BR agradece!
BROOOOO
Dino Crisis 1 e 2...
Happy to see the same face model
please please please dont be like re3
I’M SO HAPPY THIS GAME WAS MY CHILDHOOD
And still no resident evil 2 classic for ps4 and ps5
Vou "jogar" pelo youtube kkkkk Não vejo a hora de ver essa gameplay no BRksEdu
Por favor, ya que les gusta alterar la historia en los remakes, solo pido que esta vez dejen vivo a Luis Sera y lo demás dejenlo igual.
"Moriré feliz"
Sem palavras!
This is so weird because it's almost too serious but im not complaining about that
my only question is this a remake or remastered ?
See you all in 3 years when they announce RE5 remake
Greatest game of all time and all platforms, I'm so getting a PS5 now this game really made took the decision finally.
A la mierdaaaaaaa
the resident evil that ruined survival horror
I'm still amazed people actually find RE frightening. If they are able to intertwine whatever horror these games are supposed to have with the OG narrative, I'm all for it.
The best game of this francvhise. By far
I’m not sure about remake… remaster would be nice though. RE 4 its a perfect game. There are some thing that needs polishing, but its something that can be done while doing remaster not remake
only PS5?
The day after my birthday and oh what a perfect birthday gift this will be!
So hyped and I hope they kept all the campiness!
tbh, RE4 doesn't need a remake, or like this early  I would prefer CV over this one
Not for PS 4?
I hope they do RE5 and CV, even 0 and Original deserve this treatment.
Era el codigo veronica :)
MATALO!!!
Thats on my frickin birthday, how high are the chances?!
Só queria que saísse também para o PS4 Tenho câncer e não tenho condições de comprar um ps5 e jogar um remake da minha franquia favorita
Code Veronica or Dino Crisis Next PLEASE !!!
About fu*king time.
Well, this time at least it's an actual remaster instead of an HD remake
Is it gonna be only on Playstation or its gonna be on xbox
Where is everyone going bingo?
If the game isn't as cheesy as the original I'm gonna riot. also....LUIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
But It's wasn't different, it was worse
Will it be available for ps4
Hopefully it won’t be garbage like that 3rd remake. Total flop.
Apple 🍏
Deveria sair um remake era do code veronica não do 4 Tudo bem que o 4 foi um divisor de águas  Mas um code veronica remake seria uma ótima
Yo solo espero que se le pueda ver debajo de la falda a la hija del Presi 😎
Leoooon heeeeelp now  in 4k
Que sea en tercera persona por favor!
ooooo ima do a walkthrough <3
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Melosky
pc?
Hey Capcom, why you got to do Code Veronica dirty like that?
holy f
Más les vale que hablen español
LETS GOO !
This is cool but wasn’t really necessary of laws of the remake RE5 next with “next gen” boulder punching.
All these Remakes and Rockstar still won't release gta6
!
Espectacular, solo diré eso ... a juntar plata para comprarse la Ps5 Nomas
I want!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
😶is remake 😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶
Well as the Merchant always says "Ahh.. I'll buy it at a High Price"
If I can just get the RE2 remake version of Leon in Re4 with a fresh coat of paint I'll be happy.
Só espero uma coisa,"ei forasteiro".
Nose me da mala espina que no sera igual al original. Hubieran hecho el 3.5 que fue cancelado ni modo
Mi dilema es ver ka serie subida por Jordi madresalvaje o Illojuan
Dont you dare delete salazar charecter 😡
Ayi esta!
I AM SHOOKETH
I hope we get a raytraced cheeseburger in this one
Can't wait for The Legendary Merchant  "Welcome" "What are ya buyin'? What are ya sellin'" "Hehehehe, Thank you"  "Come back anytime"
Leon Help!!!!!!!!!!
STRANGARHH!!
Cosa linda😢
Mike!!!!!!
es una serie , pelicula o es un juego
que buen momento para estar VIVO
RE4 Remastered will come in at a whopping 4 hour completion
What're you buying?
Can’t wait for a RE 5 remake 😮‍💨😮‍💨😩😩
Que dure bastante pls
This better just be a graphics upgrade
Why?
"Leon You entertain me".
Um forasteirooooo
Shame pewdiepie is still in the game.
Things fans expect from this remake:  1. Do not cut locations but improve them. 2. Make it more sinister. 3. Camera third person.
Did they use baby face leon from re 2?
FORASTEIRO!
I really don’t want the horror route, I like bussin at the enemies like in re4  I skipped most of the remakes because of that style. Really hope the give you plenty of ammo if they do take that slow horror route
Where are the spanish insults?
Porfavor que sea exactamente igual al original pero con mejores graficos 🙏🏻 No arruinen mi juego favorito porfavor 🙏🏻
the best game in the franchise, it was (and still) so unique
this is so dumb. RE4 was already perfect. this game doesnt need a remake. id much rather them do the original, zero, or code veronica in the new style. i dont have high hopes for this one
Naaa bonito y todo pero cuando ya salga el juego empezaran los hates ya, los remakes hoy en dia ya son muy sobrevalorados por los fans inconformistas T-T
Well the merchant did say ComE bAcK aNY TiMe
Beuteful
EL remake de DINO CRISIS 2 es mas necesario el RE4 de ps2 ya estaba bien.
I hope Capcom does NOT mess up RE4. I mean RE4 on Gamecube is my favorite Resident Evil game ever. I would gladly play it from start to finish to this day even. I played it so many times that on "Professional" playthrough I beat the game using knife only, except for certain bosses where I used guns at necessary times. But point stands, RE4 is also one of the best games ever made so I really hope this new RE4 does not get messed up by Capcom.
WE WANT SILENT HILL , WE WANT SILENT HILL , WE WANT SILENT HILL …. Who’s with me !??
PC ????
I’m glad to hear Nick Apostolides back as Leon again, he was perfect in RE2 Remake. A lot of people I seen think he can’t voice an older version of Leon, but he’s going to deliver an amazing performance in this game that's for sure!
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL BROOOO
ufff el RE4 marcó historia
it would be a joke..
Compra día 1, Bombazo!!! Ojalá mantenga lo bueno del original y las mejoras que añadan potencien el juego como se merece.
Ojala y no lo hagan tan incoherente y corto como el 3 porque con este número del RE creame que los fans nos vamos arder y mucho
If they do anything like they did with Resident Evil remake this is going to be an amazing experience that you don't want spoiled
I hope I have money to buy ps5 😭😭
I Wonder why they made Re4 VR if theyre gonna remake it anyway......Maybe to prepare us for RE4 Remake on PSVR2?
Please keep the cheese
i would love both voices of leon
I knew they were gonna come out with another game
Tiene el ambiente de resident evil 8 😍
ctm me voii a comprar ps5
España!
After 10 remasters and ports they finnaly sat down and make a remake
HELP ME LEON
solo espero que no quiten esas pequeñas cosas que hicieron al resident evil 4 tan bueno para mi como el buhonero, las frases del los infectados normales, que el monstruo del lago te coma si le disparas mucho, las piruetas fantasma de leon y algo que si es mas importante es que no corten contenido del juego, ya sea por tiempo o querer darle "atmosfera"
🔥
AHORA SI HAY MOTIVOS PARA VIVIR
This looks like one of those *insert a classic character into a modern engine* tech demos, and I know none of the original creators are involved. No thanks.
Gory Version
Ya dejen de comparar los Remakes con los originales. Si no pueden vivir con el hecho de que los Remakes vienen con una quita y pon en sus historias, simplemente no lo jueguen y dejen jugar en paz a los demás.
La mejor forma de disfrutar el juego es con Jordi Wild
babadoooo
They are messing with fire. RE4 is considered to one of the best games of all time. If they butcher this by streamlining too much...........
梅田さんがこれをどう捉えるかですな～～ｗ
Wena, esperemos que no lo arruinen como el 3 y sigan la senda del 2 remake
i was 6 yrs old playing this masterpiece i look foward putting hours in this one as well code veronica needs a remake
Quien me compra o cambia un riñon por una PS5?  *llora de emoción*
I Wana see Ashley
if only it was available for ps4 too 💔
my body is ready for you leon 🙇🏻
ashley is the most important npc , not like other game when u try to protect npc they just do something stupid , but with ashley she still by ur side and dodge line of ur aim .
Por favor no menos, solo mas se acepta,..... hey detras de ti i*mbe>>zil
Here we go agane Leonnnnnnn Leonnnnnnnn
DUBLADO PT BR !!!!!!!!
I saw the title and was like: this better not be a prank😭
COMO????
Wow 😳
I hope it 3ps not fps, i got movement sick easly now 😭😭😭😭😭
Já consigo até ouvir: *DETRÁS DE TI IMBECIL*
GAME OF THE DECADE
ماااااااليه حل 🔥🔥
They made Ashley look so much better.
ay me vengo ay me vengoooooo
PS4 ?
Nice
Leoooon kkk
Perfect remake doesn't exist.
Open your eyes,  it is time to witness perfection.
Merchant confirmed?
Please don’t let this leon be a simp he was always too cool for that
YES! Finally :)
Oh my cat!
RE4 remake?
The best Resident evil part ever so excited to play it in high quality picture
alelluya!!!!!!!!!
to na alegria, to na alegria
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSS!!!!!!
Por esto voy a ser mejor estudiante, haré mis tareas y trabajaré
This honestly didn't need a remake, But it looks quite nice.
can''t wait!
Hey its on my birthday 🙂
💜
Resident Evil Code Veronica next please
Oh yes momma
Ole killo!!
Ya quiero ver al peña nieto como lo dejaron.
Las Plagas, we meet again.
Shut up and take my money!
I am literally speechless right now.
Since they have now remade all the past main entries, does this mean they will eventually remake 5 and 6?
**hehehehe thank you capcom**
Let's gooooooo!!!!!!
nice!!!
Now can we have a Revelations 3 for the Switch 2.0?
😌👌
It Just needs to be done like RE2 Remake and this game is going to be epic!
My favorite game remastered? And it’s coming out on my birthday?
shotgun with a 100 ammo , lets go baby.......
After the RE3 disaster, DO NOT PRE-ORDER !!! No matter how much it looks ace. Wait for reviews to hopefully find out if it takes longer to finish than the time it takes to boil a kettle.
Wellcome stranger
Wow 👍🏻
Really like that bomber jacket. I bet it's a pretty penny in real life to be listed at the bottom of the trailer
Solo espero que no sea en primera persona.
Gracias playstation por esto, no tenía la certeza que esto iba a salir pero fue el motivo de comprarme una ps5 por que vivia con esa ilusion de ver un remake de esta joya 👌😀
I hope it's available for ps4
If we calculate given the RE3r , this game will end before the castle , in game cube terms before the disc2. Bet on it.
It just made my month, thanks
Ufff esta hermoso <3
LOVE IT
1998... "I'll never forget it"
LEOON! HELP ME, LEON!!
If there's no "Where's everyone going, BINGO?" line, I won't buy it.
Can't wait for Chris to punch a boulder in 4k in the eventual RE5 Remake
APRENDE KONAMI ASI SE MANTIENE UNA SAGA VIVA, INOPERANTES DE MI....
Lionnnn , eeeehhhh Lionnnn lionnnnnn lionnn ehhhhh🤣
im not gonna play it , the chainsaw still  terrifying me . sometime they just come out of no where
Really? Remaking this one? Oh, just don't dumb it down like the other ones. This one deserves a full RE:MAKE.
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS!!!!! I'm so exited to play it that looks so insane!!!
When RE9 😕
Please make Ashley useful! Please make Ashley useful! Please make Ashley useful!
Oooh. Ashley has a makeover
bro coryxkenshin better play this bruh
AAAAAAAA
The voice isn't for me right now so I'll give it time for when I play it  but it's gonna be rough not using OG voice of leon for me but ik he passed away RIP Goat
My wallet is crying because it's gonna be empty after I buy a ps5 FF 16 and re4
Hoping it still has Mercenaries and Adas side mission stories.. so we’ll definitely see wesker :O
The original can’t be beat to me. Capcom, go ahead and try and change my mind! >:3
Any chance this comes out for PS4? :((((
As cool as this is I can't help but think, why?  The original has aged like fine wine so this remake just seems unessesary
El tráiler de RE4 es el que tiene mas reproducciones xD
NOOOOOO ME VUELVO LOCO
Nice our childhood games gonna get the remake version
Game looks nice. But why? Just straight skipped over Code Veronica (the most outdated of the main games yet). And RE4 Has already been ported to literally every system and is backwards compatible on modern ones.
Ojalá venga con la historia de Ada Wong. Aunque son tan caraduras que lo van a vender como DLC
Better let you play as Luis finally
Se não tiver o bom e velho "atrás de ti  imbecil" não compro! Kkk
finally
The hype is real!!
So you're remaking the RE game that needs it least, when Code: Veronica is right there...
1:30. The Ganados look way scarier than in the original.
Very exciting love the original and definitely will be playing this. I also will be taking notes along the way seeing what is still there and if there are any big cuts made. Watching this made me wonder if we will get 3 playable characters in the Remake Leon, Ashley, and Ada? I know Ada had her Separate Ways extra in the original.
I hope this will end up like RE2 remake and not RE3 remake.
LEON HELP ME!!!
Louis and Saddler sound awful
Ou sony não poderia lança o jogo pra ps4 ??
Why not in ps4?😠😠😠
Krauser we will meet again
FINALMENTE
Este bellísimo.jpg  Con ganas ya de este Remake del Resident por excelencia, su Majestad el Señor RE4
Jaja, Hola pendejos!!
привет от каменщика🍞
NOOOOO CÓMO?
This is big. Best RE since RE7 I can't wait to get back in the shoes of Leon after so many years (referring to the original RE4)
Cómo dirían los zombies españoles como los escuchamos los mexicanos  Detradfs de ti invedfsil y viene con palabras nuevas como: está way ,brutal,vale,mola,majo,voy a dar por cul.....o
Can't wait to hear Ashley yell LEEEEEEOOOOOOON! Every 5 seconds lol
Finally ❤️❤️❤️
Just do 5 and I’ll be happy. I don’t like 4 at all! I’m playing 3 rn
Not only will you need cash but you will need guts to buy that weapon!!!
PS5 exclusive ?? please release for PS4 as well
Espero que não estraguem que nem no 3 Remake. Não me decepcione Capcom
disgusting trailer how should I watch this video constantly blinking? same as if  they shown a slideshow
Are you sure it won't be a "Resident Evil Village 2.0"?  Anyway, just don't destroy the game with Woke stuff. That's all we ask...
This looks fun, I'd play it, but too bad horror games don't scare me like they used to when I was a kid, I remember always avoided the frightening chainsaw guy back then. 😅
Interesting but code Veronica would of been nice to make instead
Me vale si mi pc explota serán 240fps 4k
About time
yo solo espero que siga gratis conseguir los trajes especiales como el mercenario y lo de Ada... que no te vendan todo por separado...
I really want to see how this compares to the next Silent Hill game coming out…..
i hope ditman glitch was still there lol 🤣😂
Solo saldrá para PS5 y XBOX Serie X ?
5 and 6 remaster too?
Enough RE we need Dino Crisis
💪💪🔥
Yeah baby woooo
Me: - watching state of play -  State of play: - starts -   RE4 Merchant: WWWELCOME
Now this...hopefully it doesn't get censored in any way and stays true to the original. If it does, it'll be amazing like the original one
Unpopular opinion: Resident Evil 3 Remake wasnt a bad game. Shocking i know...
My question is who’s voicing Leon, is it the same dude from 2?
Lets just hope they take their time with this remake unlike the Re3 one... ugh so bad.
The original was open the door to the gaming life for me, It’s really glad to see the video game I grew up with finally got the chance. I really hope they add more stories to Luis as well.
Dios 😍🤤
OH! joder! Se ve Genial! Ya quiero Jugarlo!!!!
O bagui vai ser doido! Huchacha! Que o remake onre o 4!
El momento más esperado por todo el planeta !!! Dios mío juegazo de mi infancia , literalmente tengo el juego en todas las consolas que se puede jugar a este hermoso título , sin duda mi juego favorito , solo falta esperar a que salga para tenerlo para la ps5 y tener este hermoso juego en todas las consolas !!!!
Welcome!!!!
Use Green World by Gorillaz next time Capcom, would fit the game
Morir es vivir! Ya es hora de asplastar! 😭 Lloro al saber que van a cambiar todo
Let’s waiting :)
Welcome back, strangers!
💪💪♥️♥️
Welllllll~~~come~~~
Everyone: *Finally*
Capcom.....why?😶  RE2 and RE3 remake made sense, but this right here makes absolutely no sense at all.
I hope it's as long as the original game, with the gameplay and graphics of RE2 Remake.
Leon help Help me leon Etc etc here we go again XD
PLEASE REMAKE RE : OUTBREAK TOO CAPCOM 🥺❤
Shut up and take my money!
??????!!!!!!!
Solo espero que todos los minijuegos y capitulos extra no vengan como DLC de pago
Rather see a remake Code Veronica. RE4 was perfect as it was. But chances are I’ll play this one too, lol
Nananan epico, no esperaba para nada que lo anuncien hoy.. Ya quiero que pasen los 9 meses que faltan jajaj
I hope  the wolf will be there again too
Leon and Krauser  knife battle! So epic! I NEED THIS AGAIN!
Espero que esteja melhor que o remake do três,e não corte/altere partes do jogo... Estou ansiosa demais!!
:'c la van a volver a cagar... ya se ve
man i really hoping for dino crisis 2 remake now 😭😭
Code Veronica Remake, not this
Hashley!!!!!!! 😍
Meh, i still member remake 3.
free firme,?
no habla espanol
Cuál era la necesidad?
"What are you buyin'?" intensifies
._.” *flashbacks of being chased by Regenerators*
Para Ps4 xfavorr! 🥺
Let's all simp for Leon again for this remake.
sheeshh
Отличный повод достать свою PS2 с полки и окунутся в прошлое, чтобы в следующем году встретить его в новой оплетке)
Time to hear the "LEON HEEEAAALLPPPP"
I am enjoying these remakes but what if we got a RE1 remake instead? Or a Code Veronica
I hope the NG+ infinite ammo weapons will be awesome.
MY CHILDHOOD!!!!
Imagine iron maiden or regenerator looks like  in this graphic 🙄😳
When I originally played RE 4, I enjoyed it as a video game, but I also could not help but miss the stronger focus on horror from the earlier games. Given this, I am very glad that Capcom's visual treatment for this remake appears to add a daunting and horrific feel to the environment that originally was not there. Congratulations, you have my vested interest.
Ashley is looking great!   But honestly, I am tempering my expectations due to Resident Evil 3 Remake having so much cut content. That game should never have been released like that.  The oversimplification of the Nemesis (compared to the Tyrant of RE2R), the simplified, linear, and boring maps, cut content (both in the map itself and boss fights). It's especially tragic because it could've been so much better! But whatever, rant over. Cautiously optimistic for RE4 Remake.
Davy Jones nunca esteve tão feliz
capcom botou tantas falas menos a inesquecível LEON HELPPPPPPPPPP
PS4??????? ??? 😞😞😞
The Dream Become True 🥹🖤.
My cousin played this one always raved how great it was. I wasn’t gaming anymore at the time. Now I got my chance to experience it 👍🤩
Is this another remaster? Come on gamers we deserve better than this. These big companies are just repolishing turds and you guys are eating it up. WHERE ARE THE NEW GAMES!?
This been ported SO many times tho, it is GORGEOUS but man I am already sick of 4.
I hope they add a bit to the last 1/3 of the game and dont cut too much from the original. Also cant wait to see how creepy the regenerators and iron maidens will be.
One of my all time favorite game! I’ve completed it on so many different consoles and replayed the new game+ so many times. This game is a masterpiece 🧟🔥
I can't wait to hear the "Welcome, got some rare things on sale stranger" "Is that old stranger" "Hehehehe thank you" "Comeback anytime"
NEM FUDENDO
Yo this on PS4 as well right?
no me digan que es exclusivo de play 5 :c
I have been waiting for this since years. A game that brought me into the gaming world. Finally RE4 remake 😭😭
Já passei horas na madrugada zerando várias vezes essa relíquia, só vem nostalgia pura <3
Me hubiese gustado que le pusieran el mismo empeño al remake del 3 que oportunidad tan desperdiciada
And the milking continues lol. The game is already amazing and doesn't need a remake.
Ok but why though.
Shut up and take my mony 😍😍😍😍
Wait. Follow me. Wait. Follow me. Wait. Follow me. Wait. Follow me.
헤으응 눈나ㅏㅏㅏ
Can't wait for the VR version in 2038
The best resident evil, hope that remake will be the best too
Reminds me of the SILENT HILL 4 INTRO song.
Where's everyone going?...bingo?
Ooooooooooh I can't wait!
WAAAAAAAAW!!!!!!!!,  I really hope for much more variatif Weapons!
I hope they add Luis sera to mercenaries and give him some play time 😄 other than that, I hope they kept everything the same!
donde esta el ragnarok =(
Please release in ps4 to :(
Now that's how you do a remake!!! (In my will Smith voice)🤣
Eu tô surtando véi 😍
I just hope they don't make Leon a soyboy like re2 remake. I loved his design in infinite darkness and re6.
Ojala las voces sean de verdaderos españoles y que la hija del presidente tenga varias cosas que hacer en solitario, esperaba que reciclaran algo del 3.5 porque ese 3.5 daba miedo .- con el 3 se cagaron en algunas cosas y espero este sea la redencion pero que tampoco la caguen con el 5 porque si siguen este camino de mejorar la franquicia estara genial y porfa CODE VERONICA!!!
Hope hunk and krauser history Mode!!!
Ojalá el juego sea igual de largo y emocionante como el RE4 original y el RE2 remake y no recorten y sea tan simple la historia como en el remake del 3.
BRUH THIS SOON?? SO GASSEDDD
Nothing beats the original. This remake had a huge shoes to fill in. Hopefully it can meets EVERYONE's expectations!
I am super excited for this game 😍
ooo me vengo
I played Resident Evil 4 before.
Yesss!! Remake 4 looks more reality!! Hopefully better than the Original!!
Wow this the best reveal!! I'm so happy!!
LEON! HELP!!!
If they even change a piece of punctuation I’m gonna flip. You cannot top the original’s dialogue, it’s physically impossible
I can already hear the annoying screaming
I bought the 2 and 3 remakes but I'm passing on this. As much as it's loved, it's this game that pushed resident evil away from survival horror to action horror. I'm not going to encourage that back step again.
Ada's iconic dress please
Algo que no me gusta es que no le vi el vestido original a Ada 🤔
Perfect example of a timeless immortal game <3 super excited for this
I think, this gonna be really awesome!
THE BIG CHEESE 🧀
Sam Raimi and  David Cronenberg Imagination.
Where's everyone going? Bingo?
No mames si es real.
AMAZING GAME 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Hope they don’t remove the castle and transform the island into a “clean” laboratory, remove enemies, weapons, and ballistic jokes. Hope they improve the original by adding rejected enemies and locations.  But what I’ve seen… they already removed Ada’s red dress to make her more in RE6 style…
Where’s everyone going bingo?
Un forastero..
Ahora es un juego más del montón, el original fue revolucionario.
Six years has passed since that horrendous incident...
banda porque no dice ps4, solo ps5 ?
ソフトの前にps5買わないと。。
This looks cool, but it ain't gonna beat the original.
Another Resident evil that Will nothing New to offer damn...i didn't see that coming
Solo espero que conserven las voces originales de los enemigos y las pesetas 🤞
Finally, after waiting for years! Can't wait to play this legendary remake!
Lamentable que no ten ps5 😭
Oh heck yes. To quote Luis, "It's game time."
Este uno de mis juegos favoritos y me emociona muchísimo, es solo echo de pensar como se van aver leon , los monstruos y el monstruo más querido, temido y único el Regenerador ese monstruo me traumo la verdad espero con mucha ansias este juego
I’d better be able to suplex
El castillo de Salazar 🔥🔥
Me pregunto si este sera el primer juego con dablaje latino de capcom 🧐
wish they made code veronica reMake instead - still looking forward to it.
Year 2028: Resident Evil 2 Remake Remake. Year 2030: Resident Evil 3 Remake Remake. Year 2039: Resident Evil 2 Remake Remake Remake.
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees!
Ah, The choice of an avid game collector! It’s a nice game, stranger!
I really wished they would have just worked on a directors cut version of RE3: Remake but oh well 🤷‍♂️
Am buzzing to play it
I hope Ashley is more useful now...
Dejen de robar con los mismos productos de siempre
Pô, o jogo tá lindão.
Remake code Veronica before games that are still ported on modern consoles 😭😭 let us see Steve in a much less cringe light please
Subanse al tren del hype!
I hope they made ashley more useful
make leon cool don't nerf the guy
The iconic leather jacket.
oh I come PS aaaahhggg
I desperately hope that the “PSVR content in development” is a fully playable version of the game in VR and not just a couple minigames or short experiences, that would be extremely disappointing
𝐓𝐇𝐈𝐒 𝐒𝐎 𝐍𝐈𝐂𝐄 🤍
Hype couldn't be higher this was a masterpiece they have the blueprint for greatness jus follow it
they really, really hate Code Veronica.
This is the remake I'm waiting for.
Yeeees
Ashley:Leon Heeeeeeelp
Please release it on ps4
Se não estragarem igual fizeram com o 3...
Both original and remake has its own greatness.
You know a game was great when it was remade. It is a challenge to remake RE4 since the original one was already a masterpiece. I hope this is as great as the original.
I can already hear the most annoying cry for help in video game history - "Leeeeoooonnnn!"
to sentindo que vão fazer cagada
ojala que mi laptop pueda correrlo, llevo esperando esto toda mi vida 😖😖😖😖😖
Would have loved to see this revealed to a crowd of fans
Imagine if the end had the merchant saying one of his lines, a chainsaw sound or the regenerator breathing.
Tenho até o dia 23 de março de 2023 para comprar uma placa de vídeo.
Ps4😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢
ps4 or ps5?
espero que no pierda la escancia del resident evil 4 original
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa atioço heinnn
@Qorygore
Hallelluyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!! Finally ive been waiting for this for a long time
Looking at Leon from the side view, it looks like this character model will be the same one from RE 2 Remake. Just a bit older looking.
Hoy acaba de revivir en Gaming
Yoooooo
My bank Capcom FCU could probably make a better game.
Preferem fazer um remake de "Jo voy acer picadinho" do que fazer um RE9 com a Jill... shame, shame.
CAPCOM ON FIRE 🔥
This was the game that made me stop playing resident evil…. I know a lot of people like, but for me they changed to much… after this one things just got worse.
RE4 return
Welcome back, stranger
I just hope that they don't cut out any of the jokes
Ole tío ole
España como siempre siendo solo flamenco y paella (sarcasmo)
Hope the next remake is the original because this one feels kinda pointless imo
Este es el juego que va a salir en la Playstation 5,6,7,8 y para cuando salga la play 6, apenas habrá Playstation 5
This game makes my childhood.
This video just gave me a hardon, i could drill walls while watching it over and over.
now the number 4 is before resident evil =D
Está parte de mi vida se llama felicidad 😍
I dont think im ready to have nightmares of the regenerators again just yet
Hay esta!!!
HUHUHUHUHUHUHYHU
I hope they don't cut the ballistics joke.
Joder! Estoy demasiado emocionada AHH!!!!
La propuesta de Ashley al final del juego seguirá en pie?  🤔🤔
Me llamaron loco.
I'm not looking forward to fighting U3 again with these visuals. That boss fight gave me nightmares! Hopefully they keep the bosses in from the original 🙏
No me a gustado el trailer primero la ropa de leon debe ser mas ajustada al cuerpo su jeans mas ajustado ese pantalon muy ancho la chaqueta cazadora debe ser mas pegada al cuerpo no tan ancha y el cabello otra vez feo como el de resident evil remake deben hacerlo bien peinado que tenga ese look de resident evil 4 lo demas si esta bien.
Esperemos que no sea una basura como el remake del resident evil 3
Today is a historical day for gaming history.
this is art, it's going to be a glorious and amazing game. This will be perfect 🥰
４はシリーズで一番面白かったからリメイクには不安と期待が大きいな。
What're ya buyin?
The regenerators are gonna be horrifying.
Amazing
launch for PS4 pleaseeeee!
Sensacional 👏🏼😍😍😍
Que viva España y que viva Cristo Rey!
*HYPE!* I never wanted to play the original for the uncomfortable viewfinder, I hope they fixed it!
Will the spanish cops return?
Al fin podre escuchar "Detrás de ti imbécil" pero en 4K!! 😎👍
Very excited for this, I tried to play the original on PS3 but it’s very laggy
nova meta de vida: jogar re4 remake
🔥❤️
Omfg....
Por favor no arruinen el mejor juego de resident evil jamás hecho
Leon same voice as Ethan??
Saldra para ps4?
I dont know... Do you guy see this game as a new gen remake? I mean, trully PS5/Xbox X gen? I see the same PS4/Xbox One graphics. The same happens with Final Fantasy XVI. I dont see the same realistic graphics like Black Myth or the Unreal 5 demo shown for PS5.
ps4? :c
Uhh forasteiro
Leon's face from re2 remake?  It has been 6 years after re2 incident, he looks a bit too young if they have in fact adopted this model for his face.  This trailer also has a resident evil village vibe to it I don't know why..
Fico imaginando o Krauser e o Wesker no game como no original, não somente eles como torço para o HUNK(do modo mercenaries do original) aparecer.
This game doesn't need a remake. They should have remade 3 better
okay this is pretty cool hopefully why dont mess this up..
Yessssahhhhh!!!! Loved this game!
i have only played the vr version and i found it to be really fun hopefully they release the other resident evil games in vr too
You guys seriously gonna play RE4 completely straight. This is going to be terrible.
Otro vaz ,ya ni tiene jugo xd
Yes and Yes!!!
Deberían poner un separate ways de Luis
This time i can be different, it has to...
"The pain..." *shows photo of Ashley*
I can totally imagine an achievement/trophy "You Pervert" that alot of people are gonna get for looking up Ashley skirt 😂
Finalmente poderei jogar o jogo que eu mais estava desejando ultimamente!!! Vem RESIDENT EVIL 4 <3
Epic
Pohello pohello po po po
I Really hope It's will turn the best game year
The Best Game Ever is back ! but I afraid after RE3 Remake...
After 17 years the legendary game finally has its own remake!
el gigante bouta get a glowup
I’ll buy this at a high price!
AAAAAAAAAAA
Wow so it was real after all, can't wait to play!
All I’m going to say is “ morir es vivir”
if this is 1 for 1......      if it's missing ONE thing, i'm out xD
UN FORASTERO !!!!!!!!
Let me ask you all: “what are ye buyin?”
YOOOO ADA WONG USING MORE MAKES SENSE SUIT!!!! SHE'S LITERALLY USING SPY SUIT!!!!
Finally
I hope Ashley functionality is like Moira in Revelations 2. I don't need her to be badass or hold gun but gurl there are many things around to use protect yourself
Still cant find a PS5, oh well, it looks pretty though.
epic
saben si la exclusividad es temporal? si no es así me estarán obligando a comprar una ps5 y están carísimas  :,(
LEON...LEON...LEON
Let’s hope it doesn’t get RE3 remake treatment
Ready fon another seasson of: "Leon!!!! Heeeelp!!!!" (? xD
Si me quitas el "detrás de tí, imbessil", como que ya no es lo mismo. Pd.: Mucho PS5 pero...no hay. Tampoco de la otra, sì. Pero *NO HAY PS5* . Algo no va bien.
We got a sad boy Leon now. I'm excited about this!!!
No se pasen de chorizo !!!!!!
Very cool, always welcome a RE remaster.
Let's goooooo
CARALHO EU TÔ TREMENDO MANO
1:23 el buhonero!!
Los mejores 5 *Resident* : 1: _Resident Evil_ *2* 2: Resident Evil *4* 3: Resident Evil *1* 4: Resident Evil *3* 5: Resident Evil *7*
¿No hay más ideas? Reboot, reboot, reboot. Nah, haber si al menos modifican la trama porque si hacen luego remake de RE5 sin cambios van a JODERLO.
"Help me Leon"  in 3D audio.
I don't think RE4 needs a remake as much as Code Veronica.
Residents evil 2 ramake, nah don’t need to play it. Resident evil 3 remake! Eh looks kinda short. RE4 Remake.  WHAT ARE THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS!
When I visit the nearest GameStop on March 24 2023 I’ll head straight to the bar and expect nothing less then:  WHAT‘RE YA BUYIN‘?
How Jack Krauser there will be
I wish they would remake code veronica
Ah yes another remake
I guess no one is tired of their nostalgia being preyed upon and cashed in on.
fena
Can you imagine if they cut out the entire castle like how they did with the clock tower in RE3 remake.
Hopefully they use the same voice actor from 2 remake. He did a great job
ae porra  finalmente caraio  que alegria mas espero que tenha para PS4 também
nooo me muero
porfavor no cambien la musica de guardadoo
Espero que la historia sea la misma que la del original, y que sea en 3 persona
I know that RE4 is the start of RE games went into action horror genre (and it's an excellent action game), but i hope the team behind this remake can balance it with the horror element, just like RE 2 remake. The original is just too much fun, a bit of horror and dread never hurt.
I can't help feeling a sense of dread. Please don't ruin this Capcom
This game is so nostalgic yet Amazing  seeing it having a remake is like a dream come true ❤️
This is one of those games I’m just gonna wait to see what the reviews are. I’m very skeptical rn
no puedo esperar para ver otra vez la comunidad autonoma mexicana de españa
SWEET! I hope they bring a PSVR2 mode, it'd be mental with the new hardware specs.
ROBLEIS MIRA ESTOOOOO!!!!!
Disculpen que sea algo ignorante solo saldra para play 5 verdad?
Morir es vivir
Parad ya de hacer remakes por favor. 3 remakes en 3 años, que horror. Vale, está bien que hagan remakes para celebrar aniversarios y tal, pero es que esto es ya excesivo. Ya pierde toda la gracia y magia que tiene un remake cuando haces 90000 remakes. El próximo año que pasa, que sale el remake del 5? porque vamos jajajja
it's un forastero time
Content?
Hopefully lady dimitresc makes a cameo😉
OH MY GOSSHHHH
Simplemente INCREÍBLE Es el juego más importante de mi vida, el que más veces me he pasado y con el que realmente me enamoré de la saga... Venga Capcom confiamos en que le hagas honor a este juego histórico con un remake a la altura
This is the game that brought me to the resident evil series, and my favorite horror game of all time.  This remake looks so beautiful i honestly cant wait to play the game and save ashley grayham for the 69th time.
So y’all redid 2,3,4 but no zero? :(
Diioooooooos toma todo mi dinero :v
UN FORASTERO
Woohoo! Can't wait to see the merchant again!
Okey chicos, tenemos tiempo para cambiar placas de video y comprar la ps5, porque ni en pedo sale este juego para ps4
Without VR support is going to end up being a downgrade. I hope it has VR
Even if theres a chance it will turn out bad, we'll still have the original to play
Lixo
MAAAXXXX!!!!......
Sería épico que el ganado conserve su idioma latino apesar de que el juego se basa en alguna parte de España!
I have so much hype for this remake i really hope will be so epic just like the resident evil 2 remake and i will get the ps5 for this game ❤❤❤❤
Muito massa cara🇧🇷
SOCORRO
Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
MEUDEUS EU ESPEREI TANTO PRA ESSE MOMENTO
Is that all, Stranger?
Come on, no need for Remake. We played the game 17 years ago. I'm tired of eating the same food, but only reheating it. No need, I'll miss it. Goes into the insignificant column. 👎
😍🔥🔥 fire fire
But the million dollar question is: Is the new Ashley equipped with Ballistics too?
Is this a PlayStation exclusive???
No mamen
I want re4 remake for ps4!!!
Let me guess; An RE5 remake next?  No remake for Outbreak or Code Veronica, I guess…just as well, it’ll be inferior to the originals anyway. 🤷🏾‍♂️
Interesting choice to still have Leon sound like he's 18 years old. Bad, but interesting.
I'm actually looking foward to this. It looks like they're going for a more horror vibe instead of action like the original.  I just hope it's not 2 hours long like the RE3 remake.
Hmmm Sin VR seria un downgrade luego de la version del quest.  Porque mas alla de los visuals mejorados, una cosa es ver una pantalla en 2 Dimensiones y otra muy distinta es ver en escala real a El gigante o a Del Lago, y en 3D real.
Wow que nostalgia  igual que los remake del 2 y 3 sera una verdadera joya volverlo a jugar aunque debo ser honesto, me hubiera gustado mas ver un remake del codigo veronica, pero no me quejo  a esperar hasta 2023👌🏻
Que epico, voy vendiendo mi riñon para comprar el juego y la pc
Yesssss
Ole viva España 🇪🇸, espero los españoles ahora si hablen como españoles jajaja.    Pdt: Soy sudamericano xd.
if RE4 is remade does that mean RE6 will be remade bc it's my fav re game
Finally.
El mejor regalo de Capcom , el día de mi cumpleaños
This is my all time favourite resident evil ever, to witness the remake on ps5 is gonna be next level!!!!
@capcom, thank you for not letting this be exclusive. We all want to play this, not just playstation owners.
Keeping my fingers crossed for Code Veronica and Outbreak
Hyped for the lasers
I'm happy that they will do that, but i hope they do in a right way, i'll wait the game releases and say my opinion, after RE3, i don't trust Capcom anymore
Cara... Que... Incrível
ojala el español españolete sea mejor que el anterior
Honestly they should’ve done the hook man or fog version from 2003 e3 that would’ve been perfect but I’m still hype for this!!
I hope capcom bring old games to life other than resident evil franchise which they milked enough.
noo y para el ps4? Xd
Solo espero que las frases de los  enemigos estén todavía sin modificar, porque nada mas falta que quieran censurar eso
😍😍😍
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
booooo
This game is my childhood.
One of the best games of all time being remade? Nerve wracking is an understatement.
OW MY GOOOOOOOOIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD MAN RE4 IS REAL.
Un Forastero disliked the video
I wish I could like this ten times!
Sospeche que solo era para ps5🧐
I found this on discord holy f
Not a fan of RE2 Remake voice actors for Claire and Leon, so this version of Leon already feels inferior, but the trailer looks cool.
They better WORK TWICE as hard as they did for resident evil 2! 4 is a masterpiece
ada in a turtleneck sweater is divine
Aaaa Dios siiiiiiiii soy feliz
Bruh.
RE4 trailer without any mention of the iconic chainsaw, pretty weird
Why didn't they make Ashley in her school outfit? :(
help me leon in 4k 120 fps lets go
Where's everyone going? Bingo?
take my money
Remaking or remastering the BEST GAME EVER MADE.
¿Por que no hicieron a Ashley con su traje de escolar? :(
Hype💣💣💣💣💣
WOW
Let's Go  🙂
Gracias Play Station, la infancia de muchos está en este juego, CAPCOM, no lo arruines, espero sea igual de duradero que el original.
Graphics don't look that great, honestly, but I'm excited to play it.
Nooooooo
I'm so excited from leon especially ada wong
mobile graphics
Will they hire voice actors from Spain or will they still be Mexican? Actually, the sound from the intro is flamenco, so they should all be from Andalucía, that'll be terribly funny.
NICEEEEE!
Finally
Esto es un sueño hecho realidad, crecí jugando a Resident Evil, me lo terminé varias veces y sin lugar a dudas está fue de sus entregas favoritas.  ¡Gracias Sony!
It's going to be brilliant
I rather see a Dino Crisis remake then a re 4 remake
2023 is too late for the end of the world by the sun will explode soon
can't wait!!!!!
Nuevamente a bancarse a Ashley . Que bodrio era salvarla jajaa
I hope the ballistics are still there
FORASTERO
It looks so beautiful!
But will they keep Leon's campy one-liners and Ada's incredibly impractical dress?
I like that they're entertaining making it a darker experience, but I hope they don't fully abandon the campy nature of the original along with Leon's incredible likability.
The best
UN FORASTEROOOOOOO
Code Veronica tho...
Nunca vi la necesidad de un remake de re4. Sigo esperando uno mucho más necesario como el Outbreak (con su modo online)
Pena que excluiram uma ruma de coisa...
I hope you still can help the wolf from that trap
Esse vai ser foda,Estarei lhe aguardando.
SIMPLESMENTE PERFEITO 🖤
pq nao vai sair para ps4
The Best, the Best, the Best!
I liked Sam Raimi camera. That's was cool
It would be a really cool feature that they put Bitores Mendez as a "Nemesis", chasing you randomly in differents areas to add tension to it.
Goosebumps all over my body, I’m so excited
Can't wait for 🖤🖤
IM REALLY HYPED FOR THIS!! 🔥🔥🔥
Se ve excelente pero no me voy a haipear tanto no quiero que se repita con paso con el 3
annoying anime
水啦~~~~~
I hope they'll stick to the roots for this remake. A scarier and gorier remake (like REMake 1, REMake 2, and RE7) would be the most significant improvement to the light-toned but still perfect original
bingo night in 4k lets gooo
I swear it, if the "Detrás de ti, idiota" line doesn't make it's glorious comeback I'll skip this game entirely.
Tô Extremamente ansioso para o lançamento do game e ver as melhorias de Jogabilidade, gráficos na RE ENGINE, texturas, modelos de todos os personagens e inimigos, armas, cenários, lugares, mecânicas de jogo fora isso, etc, etc, etc... ter algumas novidades a mais acrescentadas, coisas excluídas talvez da versão original adicionadas no REMAKE, por aí!! esse Remake tem tudo para ser bom 🤩 Até que o Trailer foi dahora e difícil não estar Hypado, Por Favor Capcom não faça besteira com esse Jogo como vc fez com o RE3 REMAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!! Chega de decepções, e que venha logo 2023 pro lançamento do Game 🙏🏻🎮
About time they reveal it
they need to do re5 now with this engine never played these ones only the second one and the third one im new to this franchise
I am ready. Ready for what? For my ear.
I hope it’s better than the original. That was just a mediocre action game with bad jokes
Yeah!!! Let’s go! I’m so excited!! Re2 remake team is on this so fingers crossed they give it the love it deserves!
Les apuesto una cosa: este remake lo van a dividir en dos partes. La plata manda.
Hey Capcom, after RE2 and RE3 it is CODE VERONICA turn!!
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Seems more like RE2 Remake DLC. Disappointing.
Now they can finally start working on Outbreak
Just take my money 💵💵💵
Orale!
Code: Veronica 😭😭😭
I will pay full retail just to see my guy in 4K saying WOT'RE YA BUYIN???
ta lindo boy...
Ahora sí se van a forrar en plata
If the introduction doesn't end with the "Where's everyone going? Bingo?" line, this will be considered a failure.
Please please PLEASE remake Dino Crisis!
Want to see how beauty ada wong
TENIAN QUE HABER HECHO RE CODE VERONICA!
When this is your most anticipated game and it ends up being a ps5 exclusive
Eu pensei que iria ouvir no final a Ashley gritando: "LEOOOOOON!!!..." 😂😡🔥🤦🏻‍♂️ Gostei bastante! Perfeição! 😍
"Where is everyone going? Bingo?"  "The BIG 🧀"  "I used to be a cop myself. Only for a day, tho" "I thought I was bad"  "No thanks, bro"  "Your right hand comes off?"  I hope all these lines and many others will make a comeback 🤣. One of my all time favourite game.
I hope them mofos still curse at you in Spanish. That was the best and funniest part of the game 🤣
I hope they keep the charm of the original. "Where's everyone going? Bingo?"
While I'll be getting this on Xbox (because that's where all of my Resident Evil games are located), I am glad this was shown sooner rather than later. (Though I would have preferred a 2022 release date.)  Looking forward to Final Fantasy 16, though!
That much Spanish comments under this video? Makes sense.  Guess they'll yell at me for being a forastero again.
Ada Wong !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
NADA MAJ? PURA CINEMATICA? BAZURA EL TRAILER
is it coming to pc?
1:28 Ada looks so fine! 😍
Not liking the voices to luis and saddler
👏👏👏👏👏👏🎉
Look forward to hear HD version of HELP!!!!!! LEOOOOOONNNNNN!!!!!!... all over again XD
I really really hope it lives up to the original which is probably one of the hardest games to replicate. I'm soooo looking forward to this!
PEGA LOGO MEU DINHEIROOOOO
HABEMUS RESIDENT EVIL 4🛐🛐
Words cannot describe how excited I am for this to come out, my kid in me is screaming.
Lean sounds like Jason David frank
Epic nightmares come back
LEON!!
Where is code veronica tho
Diooooos que hype se ve hermosísimo y tiene un ambiente mucho más terrorífico y perfecionado :'D
The RE4 reddit must be going shitless by this time
disculpen pero como????? hasta el 2023 y casi a un tercio del año se les fue la olla ?????
Ashley looks super beautiful tho
AL FIN
Is this a PS5 Exclusive? I hope not. But I think it is.
Only worth if Jarl Balgruuf comes back to voice Saddler
FPS ?
sabia que este día llegaría, ya me imagino todo lo que tendrá "separate ways", los desafíos, los trajes extras (que vuelva la armadura para Ashley)
OoooH Dilicia 😋
Not another RE game 😒
leon looks like a kid strolling in the woods
LETS GO
porque 2023 ptmm
Ataque al Cora de tan epico Anuncioooooooo
A por él!
Legendary game ngl
man I can't wait for this re4 is beyond legendary
La guitarra 🎸 😫👌🏼
YESSS!
whats the point? didnt yall release it for the ps4 already?
Dang only ps5 :(
"This time, it can be different. It has to."  Yeah. This trailer is so promissing it has everything to be the best remake of the series. But...RE3 Remake also had everything to be the best remake, and it let us down a little bit. So I hope this time we get the remake that we deserve.    "If I could just forget what happened that night, the pain..."  The pain of remembering, huh ? "Forget yesterday, it ain't worth the pain of remembering".
RE4 REMAKE ❤️
Why doesn’t Capcom write that it’s a remake/remaster, this just confuses people
I feel resident evil 4 is way too over hyped, I hope this version fixes most of the cringe and Ashley constantly screaming Leon.   But so far I think the oculus VR release is the best version!
is this going be for Xbox or no
最初のギター良すぎて❤️
Finally😍😍😍
At this rate RE 5 Remake is not an impossibility 😆
He better say his Bingo line in remastered.
I wonder if the Remake will be faithful to the original like the QTEs and some action but should add more horror.
😍😍😍
HAPPINESS
1:53 his jacket looks more similar to 3.5
Wow can't wait to play the definition version on my Xbox series X!!!
give me ganados talking smack about you in spanish, ahi esta! morir es vivir!
Solo espero que sea el león de re4 original y no el del 2.
Tank controls nice
Saquen la campaña de Luis sera, ese Man estuvo trabajando para Wesker la mitad del juego
I waited so freaking long for this, im in tears my fellow gamers :")
Esperamos que a Capcom não faça merda igual ao remake do Re3.
Where da merchant at
No Code Veronica, I guess Capcom really, REALLY hates Claire.
Can’t wait!
Si Poni Lempar Is Back 🔥
Wait what? This legit?
Gotta agree with people that says the golden age of games was until the PS2 era. Newer generations are relying too much on remakes and remasters of old games.
Still lamenting that it's not Code: Vernoica.
泣けるぜ！！！！！！！！！
It's awesome, but I like the original one better.
... I've got a b***r
LEeooOOon HELp!!!
Wonder what is gonna be cut though.
THATS IT IM GETTING A PS4
Wow the nostalgia. Excited to revisit the RE4 world and characters in a new era.
歳を重ねて良かったと思える瞬間ってこういうとき何だよなぁ。
Too bad she doesn't have that rat ears anymore.
Espero que a Capcom não erre igual o Re3 remake
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'm looking forward to getting cursed out in Spanish again!
por fin, ya no va a ser re porteado el Re4 de siempre 😂😂😂
Meh I rather Capcom brings back Dino Crisis
i hope you guys make the same as RE2, not RE3
Looks like this Leon won't be making any 'Bingo' cracks
I love resident evil 4 as original game from serial game resident
time to buy ps5 then? i need to find work asap
*_"Wot 'r ya buyin'?"_*
Is it only on PlayStation?
dyjryrgfn
I'm very excited! Resident Evil 4 was part of my childhood and to this day it is one of my favorite games
It’s okay to make new games. Why not a new Onimusha instead?
Great now there is a hole in the wall because i came so hard
Toma todo mi dinero
The Drive music from the original must be present in this game
Я думал это будет мем...
Not feeling this.
HERMOSO ❤
yo solo espero que el doblaje en español no cambie, seria raro jugarlo sin escuchar la tipica frase de "Un forastero" (con acento mexicano)
The atmosphere is insanely different. This seems closer to RE8 than to the original
I'm so excited I grew up playing re4 and fun fact I still playing re4 and I'm so much happier now seeing this video. Can't wait for this one. And I know they can't do it better than original one but I wish they do it better one. And we all get our best memories of it.
Hermoso lo que se viene
Broo encerio esto es real y si no lo es no quiero despertar de este hermoso sueño 🥲🥲
That’s Awesome 💙🔥😍
The real question: is Leon still a pervert?
Just take my money
This honestly feels just like Village...
It’s only exclusive for ps5? Not steam?
🥺🥺🥺
“If I can just forgot about what happened to the RE3 remake. The disappointment. Even for a second. This time, it can be different. It has to.”
Are they making this game more horror focused than action focused?
“LEONNNNNNNNNN!!!”
PS5 with controller haptics and 3 second load times
Please do not delete or change the  merchant We want him as he was 💔💔
Can’t wait I’ll buy it on PS5 i have a question though. I wonder if it’s also comin the PS4 ??? If not there gonna miss on a lot of $$ a lot of people still don’t have a new console yet.
Lula vai retornar como ganado?
Ashley though 🔥
Let's gooooooooooooo!
Based on these comments they’ve already sold most of you on nostalgia alone, and this is why RE3 was rushed out.
I really don't like the new voice actors.
Wishing Salazar's castle part doesn't get cut
This was a great bait and switch, hats off to Capcom!
Yup I can hear it now Ashely: Leon Help !!!
I hope they won't make Leon too edgy. Although, I could forgive that if they also incorporated Ashley's suplex glitch into the gameplay.
ojalá que no la c4gu3n 🙏
Al fin revivió el gaming
NÃO VOU INFARTEI
Esta INCREÍBLE  !!! lo único que pido es que en este Remake Ahsley sea un poco mas útil y proactiva al momento de protegerla jajajajaja
Oh dang
Emocionado de revivir un grandioso vidoejuego
Este pequeño momento de mi vida se llama felicidad
As long as they don't make Leon pull a zombie-Action movie-esqe protag. We'll be fine! *Because WE ALL know how that gone...*
I won't be hyped until I see a gameplay
I wonder what Ashley wil look like at the remake any suggestions?
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍😍😍
RE4 tiene la vara MUY alta, esperemos que capcom APRENDA de sus errores y no ponga en la mesa otro RE3.
Idk I like the idea of the remake but I just hate that they didn’t use the original voice actor and made Leon look like a teen boy still also the Ashley  face model  looks odd hopefully when the time comes it looks better
Un saludo al juanito que seguro lo ve
Solo voy a decir que....: !UN FORASTEROOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!" 😅😅
Hand on Sweetheart! Miss the old day.
I hope the original voice cast comes back but I feel like that won't happen  but it sounds like that won't be the case 😢
Caballeros, llego la joya de la  conora...
Unreal
Por fin ! El Resident evil mas querido de la franquicia, justo en la nostalgia para muchos que lo jugamos en la ps2
Cheers to those who will make it till 2023 to play this masterpiece.
Waiting for all the basement dwellers to fill the comments up with how much they've changed it, and start crying that capcom isn't in direct contact with them about the changes they've made.
We want Resident Evil 1 and Zero remade. Those two are still unplayable. Almost got the complete remake.
Anthonio Banderas got called by capcom for the intro or what 🤣
😯😯😯😯😯😯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Voice actor not Paul Mercier, bruh...
Es hora de asplastar
I will buy the game. Hopeful it's not as crappy as the original.
Regresa la leyenda
I knew state of play was gonna have RE4 people legit doubted me and well who’s stupid now
Ma perché snobbare code veronica? Secondo me uno dei titoli più belli
Se me puso dura de solo ver esto dios
All these remakes, and there's no Parasite Eve Remake yet. I'm so disappointed 😅
At this point they're remastering all the past games.
Hopefully Leon will have the funny dialogue
It will been 3000  RE4 re:re:re make will be released can't ✋ XD.
I'm so happy they are making re4 remake, now if they can figure out how to get me a ps5.
Leon looks too young
Morir es vivir, morir es vivir...
krl, FODA, vai parar o mundo com esse lançamento
Been waiting for this for a while
morir es vivir HD version !
Why? We played this game 17 years ago. What is the point of this?
I'm praying Ashley has some way to defend herself.
I would absolutely love to see and hear the regenerados and iron maidens in the remake
おい マジかよ！
Only thing I hope is they dont do the same thing they did with RE3, content cut from game, I hated that so hard.
I mean, didn’t Capcom want to release re2 in 2018 and re3 in 2019 because of the 20th anniversary of the games? It really feels out of place imo. Edit: I also hope it doesn’t turn out like the re3 remake, which is really short compared to the original and changes the characters and the events.
Un forastero
What are ya buyin?
Yo espero y que este bien optimizado el juego para que explote al full la consola. tal cual fue el caso de Resident evil 2 remake.
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Very cool! Now that ya done it and actually remade this great game, now maybe you should also consider remaking RE5 and RE6. The reason that I say this is because RE4 is part of the Bioterrorism trilogy which technically is part of RE5 and RE6 and then ya have your reboot of the series.  Tho, I hope to see Code Veronica remake too...
This state of play has been incredible. RE4 remake should hopefully be on the same level. Can't wait to blast some ganados again!
mi juego favorito de la saga espero que sea fiel al original, no hay que cambiarle nada.
Ésto va se épico papus :^)
Lord sadlerrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!!
seguirá siendo ambientado en un pueblito rural de españa habitado solo por mexicanos??? digo después de todo esa gente solo hablaba con lexico mexicano...
I hope code veronica gets remake after this
Si el remake del resident evil 3 fue una vergüenza, ni me imagino que harán con el resident evil 4.
remake?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!
Will it have co-op like the original?
На моё день рожденье 24.031988😁
The only thing that matters really is if they make it the same length as the original. The remake of RE3 was so so so short.. It took like an hour to finish.
It's unfortunate that for the people who can't get their hands on a ps5 who also love the resident evil series but oh well I will watch Nicole tompkins play
This game has BIG SHOES to fill.
“What are you buying” a remake lol.
Fingers cross it doesn't contain only 1/3 of the original games content
Idk about this one. Why the all new voice actors? Should have brought back the original ones. Sadler sounds bad in this new one
y van hablar español bien o va ser igual que el original
Luis Sera is black now?
I can't believe they did it! Hoping that this is more promising than 3.
tanto que le tiraban mierda a capcom con el fracaso del resident evil 4 remaster ahora todos comentan cosas positivas, ahi los que se hacen llamar "gamers". tanto pedian un remake del resident evil 4  pues ahi esta.
Where is the merchant? :( I hope he's still in it
RE Code Veronica would've been way better for a remake but this still looks dope.
que não seja igual ao re3 remake
To be honest re code veronica needs a remake more than re4
Amazing but hey they have to launch for ps4 too
O o jogo original era mais voltado pra ação, e esse remake parece que foi bem fundo no terror, do jeitinho que a gente gosta
The long moment we’ve been waiting for boys
Mientras tanto un Port de original
I can't help but wonder why, the other remakes are of a old dated PSX games so I get it. Whether as Resi4 holds up remarkably well and is playable on all modern platforms. If you ask me Veronica needed this treatment over 4.  Looks like it's going to be more a horror game but I dunno, they're playing with fire with this one.
CENSORING MY ADA ALREADY?!!!
Agárrenlo remake. :v
Finally, I was waiting ages for this
Lol
really 2023 really
Please keep the cheesy b-movie vibe.
It’s exciting to see one of my favourite games getting a remake!!! Can’t wait to hate Ashley all over again!!! 😈
Vai sair só pra Play 5 msm ? ;-;
Ah they stuck with the baby voiced Leon
Looks great but something's kinda off with leon he looks way younger than he appeared in the original RE4
LETS GOOOOOOOO
1:02
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
ps4 graphics in ps5??
I'm so excited for it. My only dissapointment is with the voice actor cast, it should've been Matthew Mercer and not rookie cop Leon.
Resident Evil 4: Un Forastero edition
Leon, Help…
Super super super
This looks promising but i’m still mourning a possible Code Veronica remake, that game actually needs an update & I can only imagine the amazing things they could have done with it…
Finally ,this is Masterpiece
Please let this be a more horrific but just as long and great game as the original.
Sees the video: POG Sees the release date: unpog
何回も遊んでる　これもまた遊ぶだろう。
Honestly, I just played Resident Evil 4 recently and it feels like it's trying to take itself way too seriously, but, I will wait and see when more info drops, maybe, this will be the one remake, out of the recent RE remakes I like
I hope they kept him badass
Wait is this ps5 only?
"Where is everyone going, bingo"
Please don't erase half the enemies in the game for the sake of some boring stalker to follow me around.
Salazar better have more screentime, my only ask
RE4 já era o meu preferido desde sempre, então to depositando muita expectativa no remake, espero não me decepcionar...
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1:02 1:03
Por fin  un resident que equilibra bien el terror con la accion y no otro  de juego de rambo o sin   otro juego de oultlast con nombre de resident evil solo para vender :)
Day one ☝🏾
MUITO FODA PQP LES GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I'm not ready for the Leon!!!!!!
The message 'PSVR2 content in development' concerns me. This *better* be the full game in VR.
The last few resident evil remasters have been fantastic keen to get my hand on this too.
LEEEOOOONNN
this is exactly what i'm waiting for
Delicioso papuh!
imagine what Ramon salazar's mansion will be like in this remake I'm excited to meet him
I love the Classic resident evil gameplay 🙌
YOOOOOOOOOW I DON'T BELIVE
A little disappointed they didn't bring back paul mercier or matthew mercer
ngl i dont feel excited for this release. re4 made my childhood and its my number 1 game of all time, for that reason is probably why i just cant find a way to want this game, the model change, the more brooding leon, youger too its just to different from the leon i know and love from the original re4
Meu deus do ceeeeeeeeu.  Vocês acabam de ganhar  Milhões com isso kkkk
El mejor resident evil remasterizado, SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
HOLY FU K THIS MY FAVORITE GAME OF ALL TIME I REALLY WANTED REMAKE AND YESTERDAY WAS MY BIRTHDAY AND LUCKILY ITS NOT RELEASING THIS YEAR BECAUSE I STILL DONT HAVE A PS5
Resident evil 4 > the happiness and hope to live
¡OHHHHHH MEEEE VENGOOOOOOOO!
They legit don't have to change anything but the graphics and maybe tweak SLIGHTLY the aiming and you've got another great resi evil remake.
Va ser exclusivo de ps5?
I just saw this posted on the resident evil page on Facebook at the end it says ps5 Xbox series x|s and steam so it doesn’t look like it’s coming to last gen consoles for anyone wondering luckily i have a Xbox series X
OOOOOOOOO
Step 1: Complete Step 2: Don’t remove content like RE3R and make the game superior to the original and not inferior
"Re4 doesn't need a remake"  Nevermind. This looks gorgeous
LETS GOOO!!!!! LEON!!!! 😭❤️🐐🔥
Mercenaries!
Where's everyone going? Bingo?
Espero que sea igual de bueno el original y tenga un trabajo parecido al de RE2
I never played RE4 but even I know of it's reputation. And I know of all the RE games this is the one they have to get right. This is for all the beans.
Menunggu reaksi dari Resident Evil Lore Indonesia, wkwkwkwk 🤣
DIOS MIO que cosa mas bella
I am here for Ada's dress
I've never played the original, but I hear it's the best in the franchise, so I seriously can't wait, having played and loved Village.
De no saber nada,  esperar  9 meses y dias para poder jugarlo 😍😍😍😍👌👌👌👌 solo no la vayan a cagar quitandole cosas jajajajajaha
IM HYPED
Cant wait for 2023 as it will finally mean the start of the curren generation of consoles (game wise)
I'm sure it will succeed like the re2 remake🔥🔥💪 resident evil 4 remake coming😎😎👌🔥🔥🔥
ESTOY MURIENDOOOOO
Re Veronica is by now completely forgotten they should have had that one remake before  R4
I told ya all Ada will wear a turtleneck!
Espero algun dia volver a ver un outbreak 😭
Uyyy que mala suerte quería también que lo sacaran para la ps4 NOOOOOOOO porQueeee soy pobre no tengo Ps5 ni modo toca ver gamaplay aquí en YouTube como lo viejo tiempo
Leooooooon! :)
Infelizmente, acho que será só para PS5! Triste de quem parou no PS4! 😪
El juego que lo cambió todo, el juego con el que empeze Rresident :,)
My boy Leon , ok I'm playing resident evil 2 just for this
We need john cena in cod so u can fu people off the buildings in warzone
YEAH BOI
NOT IN PS4???
خدایی باید چیزی باشه که رو نسخه ۴ رو بزنه 😍
If it dosent start with "RESIDENT EVILL FOURRR!" I dont want it
pls dont be bad
Yeah R3make soiled all my hopes of a decent remake anymore especially since 4 is basically already perfect
A esperar a esperar con ansias
excited
Nossa é muito infância esse game 🥲❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This really needs to be in Xbox than Frier Machine 5
:DDDDDDD
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES !!!!!!  This makes me wonder, will RE5,6 get remakes ? And will RE1 get a remake on the RE Engine ???
Pls don’t f*ck this up, like RE3 Remake!!! 🧐🧐🧐
este juego es mi infancia
Chupa Xbox kkkkkk
gracias <3
I just hopes this lives up to the original. Tbh I don't think RE4 needed a remake but oh whale
LETS F***********KING GOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
I DONT BELIEVE AAAAHHHHHHH ❤️❤️❤️❤️😛
Why are we getting another re-release of RE4? Why couldn't we get a remake of Code Veronica? That's one thats been needing it for years and would benefit from it, whereas 4 is widely regarded as one of the best in the series. It doesn't need the remake, this could just end up damaging the original like the RE3 Remake did.
I love me some RE4, beat the everything out of it back in the day. Nostalgia aside, this feels a bit like releasing Skyrim for next gen, I hope to be blown away instead👍
un Forestero!!!
Recuerdo haber jugado el RE 4  y no pasar de la cabaña al inicio. y ahora despues de casi 20 años tengo mas de 120 horas en steam XD. Que tiempos aquellos, espero que este remake le haga justicia.
The only thing I don't like about this announcement is  me realizing that I must go through "LEON HELP " again
This is looking great but I wish Capcom brought Paul Mercier back. He’s the definitive Leon in my book and not to mention he also voiced the merchant.
why
Vcs não sabem ó tesao o tesao kkkkkkkk
So they choose to go for more horror vibes. Imagine the Regenerators in this one
VAMOOOOOOOS
I just wish they took RE4 Leon voice actor. He sounded manlier
espero que tenha modo mercenários e não algum modo online ridículo
Forastero!
Meu parceiro...
Como que alguém tá hypando isso depois do desastre que foi o 3 remake?
Can't wait to see the new version of a Blind Claw enemy
The triumphant return of Leon Skennedy! Greatest of all Real Proud Dads!!!
SHEEESSHHH
HIHIHIHEH THANK YOU
But Where Is The Code Veronica Remake?
We need Code Veronica
AYEESTAAAAA!
😥🔥🔥🔥
Loooocoooooo 💯💯no me la puedo creer que genial algo bueno ya tenía que salir se viene se viene......😻
When companies let you know they are done trying we get remake after remake
No que ya hay el 7 porqur ahora esta  el 4
ahi dios la nostalgia me va a matar a este punto,se ve increible y solo espero que por favor HAGAN UTIL A ASHLEY.
I have a feeling that the chief of the village will be like Mr. X and chase is placed. I just hope it’s more like Mr. X and not like Dimitriscu.
will it be available for ps4?
1:28 Ada!! :D
CARALHOOOOO QUE TSÃO AAAAA
I still think that RE4 is one of the last games that needs a remake considering how well the original still holds up. (Especially the Wii version with its divine pointer controls.) I’m still excited about it regardless. This remake looks pretty promising. I still would rather see Code Veronica get remade.
Ese micro segundo de Ada valioooo todoooooooooooooooo
I am not okay with these voices. Leon’s voice is such a step back
can't wait
Me voy a morir AAAAAAAAA espero y no sea malo como el 3
Wonder if they too cut half content like RE3R
Gran parte del presupuesto de este remake se va para el cabello de Leon  Resident evil 4 es un clásico de la franquicia, un juegazo se viene con el remake, el avance promete  Espero que Luis Sera tenga más desarrollo
I hope there is the mercenary mode with hunk or the guy with the beret
Te voy hacer picadillo  Españoles de resident evil 4
Ahi está!!!
I really like the landscapes of the village they are beautiful
Yeah baby 🤩
“Welcomeee” “Hehe, thank you” “Is it all sTrAnGeR?* “sTraNgEr, STRANGER!!!*
muchos no lo creyeron y finalmente sucedio :)
Pls no Ego capcom 🙈
Ashley: Leon HEEELP
PS4 plsssss
Siiiiiii conchetumareeeee
I can't wait to see this game that marked my childhood so much on PlayStation 2 🤩🤩🤩
Merchant: Over here stranger
Only in ps5???
Is it for PS4 as well?
Señoras y señores, hoy es el segundo día más feliz de mi vida.... El primero será cuando juegue está joya
I've played Resident Evil 4 on the PS2, PS3, PS4, and hopefully the PS5 soon. :)
mientras pueda seguir viendo bajo la falda de ashley pagare hasta 80 dólares por este juego
FINALLYYYY
My childhood game right here!
*OBRIGADO MEU SONHOR !!!!! PFV CAPCOM NÃO ERRA !!!!!*
Why saddler voice sounds to young? I mean, hes an old man.  Is that him?
Remake of Code: Veronica X
Grite como quinceañera, ahora si vale la pena una ps5.
Amazing owo
UN FORASTERO !!!!!!
Leon's jacket looks better than in the hookman's demo, i guess :P
joyita
En momentos así solo queda decir.... ¡¡¡¡¡UN FORASTERO!!!!!
I’ve never played RE4 before so I’m kinda excited about this game cause it looks like their going back to the horror style, and I’m so glad they got Nick Apostolides back to voice Leon cause he was brilliant in RE2 Remake.
Si no dicen "detrás de ti imbecil" pero esta vez con acento español me sentiré super ofendido
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This game has been milked more than every cow that ever existed
Es necesario decir esto, estoy emocionada por este hermoso juego queblo jugué cuando estaba niña, PERO el juego originalmente es largo, y siento que este no será la excepción, lo volverán un juego de 1 hora como lo han hecho con el RE2 y RE3 😑😑. Y por lo que veo son dos caminos (como suele ser en los remakes) el de Leon Hermoso Kennedy y Ada Wong. Espero estar equivocada.
Get ready for a more detailed version of "Leon help me!"
Now gonna be 2 hours
Шляпа какая то! Где резидент ивэл? 2022 год на дворе. Графика, ты где? В 2000 застряла чтоли?) По любому все будут играть! Жаль, что так и не научились  в резике графон делать !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Енрил енджен 5 вам в помощь! Если не обонкротитесь конечно!)))
Leoooon, heeeelp! Awesome trailer!
hope it will announced to be also released on PC by then.
Capcom Code: Verónica...😒
Am I the only one who wants the controls to be the same
Diossssss
Ojalá los ganados hablen como mexicanos como en el original.
I LIKE IT!!!!! vou zerar sapoha 500 vezes que nem o piratex que tinha no ps2!! XD
agora sim o Leon pega a Ashley eita  🥰❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Leon te amo este mjr juego del año
Atras de ti imbecil...
Primera vez que voy a sufrir por la espera de un juego
Can't wait for Leon memes reignite. I hope he can still karate kick people in this game.
Hope this goes more of a resi2 remake direction than 3 because with it having Leon they could see it as a sequel to that game techinally so if the quality isn’t there it’s kinda a let down in two ways lol
Tiene que parecerse mucho al original para que no pierdas su esencia que lo hace tan bueno. Para mí el mejor resident evil es el 4 no lo arruinen.
2023 is gonna be huge.
Resident Evil Code: Veronica(((
Podemos descansar em paz..........TESTOSTERONA!!!!💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪EU TÔ QUEBRANDO AS P0RRAS TUDO! Joguei a namorada pela janela RE4 É VIDA, É CULTURA, É POTOCA COM O MILHO POR CIMA, É MELHOR DO QUE JOQUINHO DE TERROR NA MADRUGADA!!  BORA M4TAR 3SSA TINHOSA,HELP
Finally. Ive arrived at a remake i actually played. ❤   Also, welcome back Leon.
ahora tengo mas razones para comprarme una pc nueva xd
Well... it seems that despite our best efforts, pleads and begging, Capcom did not remove Ashley.    Still gonna play it tho.
Why ONLY PS5??? 😢😭  P.S: play has limits as we can see.
John Wolfe in the back: 😮
They skipped code Veronica 😭😧
please don't make it like RE3
Las ventas de PS5 ahora van a explotar
ya me vine
LEONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN  HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELP
I hope there's co-op
el juego va a ser el mejor de esta nueva generación como lo fue antes con la primeras
LETSS GOOO
この作品は思い入れが強すぎる。 雰囲気だけでレオンがカッコいい
bad graphics
THAT SPANISH!
I hope my gtx 660 run it
hoy revivio todo el gaming señores
Me trajeron recuerdos buenos cuando lo jugue en la play station 2....  momentos que nunca volveran... bueno, dependiendo de como sea este nuevo remake.... XD
Me corroooOOooOOOooo
SIUUUUUU
めっちゃ嬉しい！！
Over there I saw a Red 9, will it be Luis Sera?
He estado esperando por miles de años esto, desde que era un rumor y ya se hizo realidad
😍😍😍😍
" ¡Detrás de ti! ... imbecil"🔪
No la caguen como el RE3 solo eso pido 😣😣
Genial a valido cada minuto ojala lo saquen en ps4
Exclusivo pra ps5?
My only wish is DO NOT CUT THE PLAYTHROUGH PLEASE!!! keep it as long as the original. Thats my only wish
i just hope the ballistics joke its still on the remake
Da para esperar ate 24 de março de 2023
No podia esperar!!!
💯
I hope Ashley is still equipped with censored
Where's that Re:Re verse!
Will it be as short as RE3 remake?
楽しみすぎる
noooo porqueeee justo en el coraaaa... solo spero que cuando salga no sea mas o menos como lo fue l remake del 3...aun asi CAPCOM siempre tiene oidos para sus seguidores del gaming.... :-)
Hopefully the Spanish peasants aren’t played by Mexicans this time.
Ole ole y oleee! 💃💃💃💃💃
dayummmm
Ojala tambien saquen remasterisaciones de resident ivel 5 y 6 seria lo maximo mas el 6 que tenia buen potencial para ser el mejor resident pero siendo completamente sincero la cagaron a medias porque en realidad el 6 no es mal juego solo que salio en un genero que se supome que es de terror
Muchas gracias por volver a traer el juego favorito de mi infancia,que me trajo a esta hermosa saga, a la nueva generación de videojuegos. Espero que sea un aporte digno al original,que lo agrande y mejore de lo que ya era. A esperar!!
DIOS MIO, ESTOY ENFERMO Y ME ACABA DE SU IR LA TEMPERATURA 40 GRADOS
welp, guess I can no longer hold off on buying a PS5
espero que Capcom no la 💩 en este juego como el R3 remake.
I'm excited to see Leon again.  I miss him.
Si carajooo!!!
I can already this won't surpass the original one
I hope Laura Bailey to be Ada Wong's voice actor in Resident Evil 4 remake. Because Ada Wong's voice in resident evil 4 2004 is almost similar to Laura Bailey's voice when she voiced Helena Harper.
por fin coño!!
Ai sim capcom !! :)
Is this gonna be on PC too ?
ojala las voces de los sectarios sean fieles al clásico
Oh my childhood memory
In my opinion resident evil 4 doesn't need to be more scary you're playing as Leon who's a badass at this point who's hardly afraid in this game. I hope they Amp the combat up in melee. I'm just hoping the tone doesn't change TOO much is all I want
LETS GO
hello world
I hope they make the regenerators as terrifying as possible
I can't wait :)
1:28 rules 34 artist :  write that down!  write that down!
Where's everyone going, bingo?
EITAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I have a bad felling about this. Capcom always goes for the lazy way out. Hope I'm proven wrong!
Best resident evil game that ever made .....
Merchant -  _"Watta ya Buyin?"_ Everyone - Yes
"Morir es Vivir"
Little rough don't you think.
"Leon, help!" In 4K 60 FPS
Oooo remake
Preferiria una buena secuela de Leon. Pero no esta mal revivir un clasico.
get ready to hear LEON HELP! in hd
Nostalgic.
Its def gon be more serious than the original,  and i love that, can't wait. capcom has been hitting it off with every game since  re7.
1:58 the texture of the photograph with the reflections looks amazing!
No me sorprenderá cuando NO saquen "Assignment Ada", "Separate ways" y "los mercenarios" por motivos raros... ya lo estoy viendo
Un año mas :v  Alguien sabe si sacaran algo este año?
Espero que conserve esos diálogos que lo volvieron un clásico ! “Detrás de ti imbécil !!”
everybody happy now resident evil 4 remake yippe, now capcom can you please!!!! remake resident evil code veronica now!!!
Espero que las voces de los ganados y los demas, esten en español de España
lo unico que me intriga del juego es la inteligencia artifial de Ashley  jaja
Ahhhh. I’ll buy it at a high price.
Can't believe my eyes,😲, it's real , it's here,RE4 remake
But still no PS5's in stores ..... why put out games if we can't even get the console unless we pay 3-4 times the retail price ?
I'm so happy ❤️❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭😁😁😁
caralhow!!!!! pqp!!! foda demais!! não tô acreditando mano, tomara que seja dublado igual o 8
Get ready for some LEEEEEEEON! HEEEEEELP!
This doesn't seem like RE Engine. Especially considering the fact that it's not labeled on it. Wonder if this will play like the original, that would be a bonus
Naaa increíbleee
Same voice as RE2R?
feels like it has some fix camera scene
it makes sense for them to remake a game that's already amazing. since they already made remakes for res 1 (it was a gamecube release but still), res 2, and res 3. so now res 4 is next. i really hope they remake res code veronica next, and then the next res game (that isn't a remake) will have the duo clair and leon team up again. i would love to see them together again, but i don't want a multiplayer expierence like res 5 or 6. but just seeing them be together again in a game would be awesome.
I hope Ashley preserves her ballistics, and I'm intrigued about Krauser's appearance.
🥵♥️♥️♥️
And still no Dino Crisis remake!
The original with the HD mod still exists and runs well, so I'm all for something pretty different.
aproyechen de hacer un remake del 5 y 6 opaaa
So, no code Veronica remake?, Well... there goes the jokes about Obama been the current president.
Agarrenlo!! Jajaja
Is nothing sacred?!?!?!
dioooosss estuve esperando este video desde el año pasado,al fin,pago lo q seaaa solo quiero revivir parte de esa infancia de sustos q me daba este juego a los 9 años
Looks great. But after the disrespect ro RE3, no money for Capcom.
“Excuse me sir, I’m looking for the girl in this photograph.”
please make ot available for other platforms like pc 🥺 !
Capcom has the right idea let's keep it going
THANK YOU
Capcom, please release the PS4 version.
Code Veronica needs a Remake right now more than RE4
Esto me recuerda a las películas de Camino Hacia El Terror
Will it be released on ps4?
I'm so glad to be alive to see this!!!
Small world eh?
LEOOOONNNNNN HELPPPPPPPPP (in 4k)
Hora que se una a la demás colección de re4 en distintas plataformas y completar su historia por 100 tecima vez!
What’s most interesting is how they’re going to remake Resident Evil 5
Este es mi juego favorito. Lo recuerdo como si fuera ayer, compre el juego para PS2 sin tener la PS2, un año despues me compraron la consola y lo primero que hice fue jugar el RE4. Juego adelantadisimo para su epoca, horas de diversion. Mi infancia.
Im stuck in RE7 because i don't have any money for games, but I really love it Ill stick with it! I dont know what secrect recipe your RE Engine has, but its amazing
porfavor haganlo con amor... no como el remake del 3
Mano que foda
I hope they keep Ashley 'Extra Balistics" in this version
I think it needs a ps4 version, for those who doesn't have ps5 and PC, Just saying because the ps4 handle re8 so it means it can handle this one.
im so excited
Capcom messed up on the RE 3 Remake focusing on multiplayer instead of making Nemesis better than Mr X.Let’s hope this is better
Quiero llorar 😭
DREAM CAME TRUE!
Saftig wie Knäckebrot
regenerators nightmare incoming!
QUE LINDO CARA! Uma parte de minha infância voltando pra nova geração ♥️
Wow, excelente. Sería bueno que también hagan Dino Crisis 2!!!
please PLEASE don't take away the quotes from the mobs!! I need my DETRÁS DE TI IMBÉSIL in the game so bad D:
I'm still bitter I haven't gotten a PS5 😑
Yay! I can't wait to hear Ashley's screaming again! 😀
AAAAAAA@HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
im crying
Espero que león se vea más mayor y no tan niño como en el segundo juego
cant wait to see what they will cut
Never played the original so wasn't hype but I guess it's time for me to play re2 remake
Seulement sur ps5?
agarrelo!..
EU VENDO UM RIM MEU PRA COMPRAR UM CONSOLE QUE RODE MAS EU VOH JOGAR ISSO, KAKAKAKAKAKAKKAKA QUE FELICIDADE EM VER ISSO
You guys; I don't know why do you have more respect and love to that PS5. Is this going to be also on PS4 or just on PS5?
After RE3 """"""""""Remake"""""""""""", my hopes are extremely low for this one. What areas/enemies/bosses are you gonna cut out this time uh ?
🥵🔥🔥
this is it
NO WAY
I hope ashley not to be such pain in the neck , and more scary creature's designs because in the original Méndez and Sadler transformation, they aren't that scary
Aí dava Jonas, já podes gozar.
Can't wait for Inventory Tetris 4
Please make the game long like the original. Is the most important
I can’t wait tho the graphics look amazing 🤩
Low IQ players waiting for that
your right hand comes off?
Man I really hope they stay true to the original, I need to here Leon say, “where’s everyone going? Bingo?!” Less swearing than the re2 and 3 remakes. It at least has to be as long as the original.
Well, we all saw this one coming.
Yum yum yum can't wait for it to come
Empiezo a rezar para que no recorten contenido de RE4 :' ) y más bien añadan nuevas cosas!!!
I can’t wait to... “LEON!!!!”  Goddammit....
dont get mad at me but this seems underwhelming.
Un Forasteroooo, que seja igual o 2 esse, e não a porcaria toda capada do 3
JUST TAKE MY MONEY NOW 💰💰💰
really? ANOTHER re-release?! Sony wont be happy until they've re-released ALL 8 Resident Evil games, what a waste!!!
いやー新しいの作ってよ、焼き回しもうええで、
León help, in HD xd
let's goooooo 🔥
Personajes confirmados:  Leon kennedy.  El presidente Graham(Padre de ashley).  Ashley Graham.  Luis Sera.  Ada Wong.  Bitores Mendez.  Osmund Saddler.  Granjeros Infectados.  Los iluminatis.   Personajes proximos a confirmar:  Ingrid Hunnigan.  Jack Krauser.  Albert Wesker.  Hunk (Modo Mercenario).  El Buhonero.  Ramon Salazar (Se me olvido si va a aparecer o no).
I’m shaking and cooming I can’t wait for March
Trush game now
Yeeeeeeees!!!!!
Love it and cannot wait!!!! 😁😁😁
Am I truly the only person that hates RE:4
Siempre escuche y lei excelentes criticas del RE4 original...de los originales solo jugue al 1...lo termine al 2 y al 3 remake que me parecieron muy buenos...intente despues de eso jugarlo al 4 original y lo deje ya que no me gustaban los controles...ahora si que de seguro le dare masa a este remake.
pinché juego más qlero ,habiendo joyas que si merecen una remasterizacion y elijen esta Basura
I hope Code Veronica came to. Bir now im so happy. My childhood iş back.
I will only give Capcom money after reading EVERY trusted review!
"Welcome, Stranger!"
Nem tô acreditando bicho. Tá lindo. Só falta o Mercenaries pra fechar com chave de ouro.
Es bellísimo 🥺...  Me hizo revivir mi infancia WOOO!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
So another remake like 2 and 3 and no this is not the oculus one from 2021 this is the one that I’ve predicated would get a remake lol
Now I really have to get my hands on a PS5.
cant wait to see if they're going to skip 2/3 of the game
Don't tell me they used Leon's Re 2 model because he doesn't fit in here
I hope they keep everything the same just improve graphics and environmental sounds with using same music
Great game I hope it will be coming for ps4 as well
I wonder how much theyre going to cut, censor and remove
Espero que no lo vayan a arruinar como con el 3, siendo honesto veo que sera dificil superar el 4 original en el sentido de la inovacion y todo lo demas implementado. Espero no se vayan por completo al horror o "terror" solo con la excusa de hacerlo porque si y meterlo bien como lo eran los momentos de tension. Las unicas cosas que espero que mantengan son que el sistema de combate sea igual o parecido (Osea las patadas y eso) y su dificultad cambiante.  Fuera de eso es mas que obvio que van a cortar un bueeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen del juego original, puedo apostar que la isla y el castillo seran los que mas lugares cortados van a tener.
Wish they made the remakes in order lol
I can’t wait to run from giant boulders in 4K
Será que no saldrá para ps4:"(
If there's no "Te voy a hacer picadillo" I don't want it
i'm freaking out...
Hoy ganó la industria de los videojuegos
Quase 20 anos para recebermos uma remasterização digna! Mal posso esperar por 2023...
Espero que no hayan olvidado el "Detrás de tí imbécil"
Give me ashley leon...
GIVE ME THE BIG CHEESE
Que locura ,va a ser tremendo este juego ,ya el 4 original es brutal
Hoy revivió el gaming
It's a brave move to remake one of the best games ever made. I really hope they do well... But this is going to be an uphill battle
😍🖤
Hola que tal les espingouins !
Wouuu se ve increíble 👏🏼💪
Voy a llorar
Believe it and you will get it! Let's gooooo! I love you!!!!! <3
The Wii Edition was my favorite version.  Having completed it on GameCube, I thought I’ll just be playing a 480p version over component digital, but the wifi mote nunchuck controls gave me a whole different experience.
Looks amazing, but I want a RE: Code Veronica Remake so badly.
for ps4
NEM FUDENDO
they better not half a$$ it like re3 was
all you had to do, was remake code veronica, capcom!
Code veronica remake please
taporraaaaaaa
ya lo quiero jugar !
Ahuevo, estoy super emocionado
I still think a RE4 remake was not necessary. Why not Code Veronica remake instead
I'm so happy I could cry. RE4 is my most replayed game of all time from the ports that I have lost count how many times I have 100% the game over the years. You bet I'm going to platinum this remake like I have done for 1-3 already.
Release for PS4 too pleeeeease
Hopefully it doesn't change too much from the original, would have love to see a Code: Veronica Remake.
Re4 é lenda
Is this exclusive?
Se ve increíble!
Osea que podrían reinterpretarlo para que el juego sea más terrorífico yo lo compraria
Cant wait to hear "what are you buying"again
esperemos que tenga todas las palabras incluso las lisuras en español que tenia el RE4 original que lo hizo tan especial en su momento, ojala la censura no llegue a este juego.
They now would have done this for 2 3 and 4. What is there no love for the original, code Veronica or 0?
Ashley : LEON !!!
While I'm excited, I do worry, because the new voice actor doesn't have nearly as much charm as the old voice actor. I mean, I still like him, but it's definitely not going to be the same Leon, and I'm just hoping for the best.
YES YES YES YES OSBDUSHDOWJSBIWJDOFJEB
????
When is capcom remaking 0 and 1
Ps4?
This looks amazing !!
ACABAN DE REVIVIR MI INFANCIA
VAMOOOOOOOOOOOOS
im not looking forward to Ashley
i love the original re4 suitcase inventory and i really hope they wont change it
YES! All we need now is Code Veronica!
LETS GOOO
They should've done a remake Code Veronica before 4.
I can already hear that annoying sound *LEON HELP* !!
I have high confidence in Capcom. RE3 remake was a bit disappointing, but this is the biggest remake yet and I don’t think they’ll rush it or cut too much content this time.
Why couldn't they just PER-FECT the RE3 REMAKE before moving onto 4? RE3 REMAKE is OKAY at best. It's trash compared to 2 Remake.
ê boy ta muito lindooo boy
Is capcom remaking until number 6???
Uma lenda retorna.
WOOOW, ESO ESTARA D PELOS!
CAPCOM I LOVE YOU <3
Code veronica next please
remember when everyone said that it didn't need a remake because it was fine? well here is an example of how anything can still be improved upon
Eu vivi meus amigos...Eu vivi para ver rumores virarem realidade,hoje! Está oficialmente anunciado um sonho,um sonho que muitos jogadores vieram sonhando durante anos,Re4 ganhou um remake.
I SEE ADA WONG I LIKE
Im getting ptsd Flashbacks to "LEONNN, HELPPP. HELP ME LEON"
Leon better say “no thanks, bro” in this game
Easy money baby
Og Luis still best luis
やっときたぁぁあ 原作と同じでレオンイケメンであってくれ..
sadler looks sickkkkkk
Pero y dino crisis? 🥺 Van a remasterizar hasta el 7 XD
Esli WANGY-WANGY
If only i could find a PS5 f@%$!@&@&
Pas encore
Incrível!
I saw a Red9, I'm a happy man.
1:57 The way he said it reminds me of Far Cry 6. Terrible acting, adgy and cring.
SO HYPE
Uff no me imagino todas las mejoras gráficas 🤩 Solo espero no recorten escenario y no quiten el modo mercenarios!
Gotta love original games
Vivir es morir
ojala que los de pueblo diga las misma cosas de original
There is no need to remake this classic.
"Detrás de tí imbécil" Excited for my favorite game to be remade😎
please, remember the aesthetics of the  old re4 the yellow tone of the vilage is change to blue, change the color pallet plse
re8 assets, leon from re2, same engine and voila
tudo fudenu recruta
AAAAAA SE VIENE EL REMAKE ¿creo que es el remake no?
That's cool, but I still would have prefered a remake of Code Veronica.
Please for the love of Saddler make it CHEESY, a little serious is fine but I NEED THE CHEESE.
VAMOOO LA CONCHA DE SU MADRE
Needless to say, I'm excited for this beautiful game that I played when I was a little girl, BUT the game is originally long, and I feel this will be no exception, they'll make it a 1 hour game like they did with RE2 and RE3 😑 😑. And from what I see there are two paths (as it usually is in remakes) that of Leon and Ada (bytch¡) Wong. I hope I'm wrong.
Here at 300,415 views.
Semoga bisa main:)
Olé
como le sacan jugo al r4
No iba a salir también en PS4 que decepción que no lo saquen
As long as I can still suplex a priest I'm fine with whatever other changes happen.
Can't wait seeing *REGENERATORS* 😐
Best "Resident Evil" part 4 , real evil and scary game , outstanding bosses and combat action with different weapons .
I'm happy about this...but I'm also dissapointed that it had to be Resident evil 4 to get the remake
Knew this was coming but I was REALLY hoping for a Code: Veronica remake
Eita pomba da peste
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
POHA FINALMENTE
I swear...if this is another 3 hour game I don't know what I'll do.
my heart just sank
🙄🤷🏽‍♂️
Akhirnya bisa liat si beban in 4K!!
ada my crush  <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
Resident evil 4 foi onde começou a queda do resident evil, é outro game, é legal, mas não é mais como os resident evils anteriores.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
dios no lo puedo creer se me salio las lagrimas de emocion al ver esto :´)
Leon! Heeeeelp!
The most loved part of the resident evil, the stakes are high and people are excited, RESIDENT EVIL FOUR! HAVE SOME RARE THINGS ON SALE, STRANGER
Seems like this remake goes more in depth on Leon's character. Gonna look forward to this.  P/S : Is that Saddler's voice in 1:33? Seems a bit different, like a younger version of his.
nos llamaron locos
The best RE game is back
Looks amazing. Only thing I would want are the original voice actors.
This is the best day of my life... thank you capcom
ps4 будет???
Oh boy, can't wait to see how they've ruined this one, just like they did with RE3 remake...
LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I'm just wanting it for PS4 since can't find PS5 anywhere still.
Res 4 has been released more than any other game in my lifetime ☠️
Será en S-PAIN
Deja tu amén en este comentario.
why? resident evil 4 is the one residesi game that doesnt need a remake ffs
Un Forastero !!! 🖤🖤🖤☠️
Obrigado capcom
I am sure it will be superior to the original 👌😚
Now to find a ps5.
Tanto tiempo esperando por esto y ahora me estas diciendo que es solo para ps5 ?
Parece que se van enfocar mas en el terror que en la accion
I truly don’t understand why everyone loves RE4 so much. It’s my least favorite of the series along with 5. idk why just doesn’t hit the same way
Bingo?
lets go!!!!
He He He *What ar ye buyin?*
Resident Evil 4 por fin dará miedo?😱😱
What are we thinking, will this be another RE:make2, or more of an RE:make3 experience? We getting a full adaptation or just a small taste. Since they aren't reusing so many assets and maps, also because this is designed for next gen hardware, my guess is this is gonna be closer to re2 remake
Lo voy a esperar con ansias, para poder romperle todo al de la motosierra
"Screems like a bi...!!! "
Only hope it's not as half assed as re3 make......
I'm dreaming on :)
Please remake Code Veronica
I feel like my sorta predictions are aligning, a darker take on RE4 that cuts out some of the action that took the series onto an over the shoulder shooter
Pc port when?
watching this genuinely game me ptsd-esque flashbacks as a child playing this game
Where is el flamenquito.
So it's not gonna be on ps4 ):
As great as this looks I'm getting sick of Capcom doing the same thing with their recent RE titles. Stop with this "Realism" BS! Resident Evil is memorable because it's not afraid to be itself. Resident Evil is not known for its realism. It's a cheesy over the top survival horror series with interesting characters that dress in stylish outfits!
CARA, QUE MARAVILHA. ESTOU HYPADO DEMAIS
COMO HACERME FELIZ CON TAN POCO ES INCREIBLE
CA RA LHO........
It's awesome 100% but it's not on PS4
LEON!!!! HELP!!!!!!
😭😭😭😭😭😭
why its called just Resident evil 4 and no re4 remake?
A dream came true ♥️🔥
Capcom, DO NOT FK THIS UP
UN FORASTERO
Cerebro cerebro...
Yeah after what happened to Resi 2 and 3 remakes. I don't have high hopes for this one.
MIERDA!  MORIR ES VIVIR!
🥵🤝🔥🗡️
OMFG!!!
I wonder if every resident evil is just gonna get a remake, doubtful but I'd still think it would be cool.
por fin ya quiero jugarlo que graficos tiene el juego 👏👏👏👏
I just wanted a RE1 remake with full 3D environments like RE2 and RE3 got. Guess its never gonna happen....
i think saw Ashley Graham, Osmund Saddler, A Ganado, Ada Wong, and hearing Luis voice too besides Leon's
Love the environments, I’m excited
Everyone: Whaddya sellin'? Capcom:
This just ensures that this game will be ported to every console until the end of time
Re4 is my favorite game so far, i have finished it around 50 times, been all my life waiting for a remake, but i can barely feel that is one is going to be mediocre for some reason
Only  to  ps5  :''''(
I really hope that Ashley isnt as annoying as in the original....
PRA QUÊ, PORRA. Era só oficializar o HD project e deixar dar uma atualizada no game. Que ódio. Toma meu dinheiro Capcom, de novo.   Vem me decepcionar vem, acostumei já!
THE YEAR 2023? WHAAAT?
I hope it isnt exclusive to playstation i really want to play it
Where'd everybody go? Bingo?
I’ll wait for the sale and unlock weapons with unlimited ammo lol. It’s worked wonders so far especially with RE Village.
The second I saw this, I screamed!!!
MASSIVE W
Anyone else hear "Leeeeeeooooooon heeeeeeeeeeelp" ?
Ps4 ? 💔🙂
Cool cool.. now do code Veronica
¡Brutal! Sin palabras, sin duda este Remake me sorprenderá.
Is a time exclusive for ps5 ?
I hope the game isn’t as serious as they make it look in this trailer
This looks so beautiful and hopefully they will get rid of the crappy controls of the original one. Can’t wait to play this on Xbox Series X
I never grew up playing these games but I was able to get ahold of 2, 7 and 8. I cant wait to play 4!
LETS FUKCKIN GOOOO ASHLEYYYY IS BACK
THANK YOU CAPCOM. CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR ASHLEY SAYING "YOU'RE PERVERT" AGAIN. AND YOUR RIGHT HAND COMES OFF? 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
dasdadasAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ]
No va a salir para ps4 😭😭😭
I can't wait!!!! 😎🥰. Capcom don't cut out stuff like you did with resident evil 3 remake. I was very disappointed with that!
The really could have just made a new Resident Evil, but remake culture ensues- even for things that absolutely do not need remaking. Nobody asked for this, and people will still lap it up despite how pathetically unfaithful the previous 2 remakes were. We already got a similar looking game anyway considering 8 literally just remade everything from 4 already, so now we likely get to see more reused assets.
Oh that's just great another Capcom exclusive game just for the PlayStation
Será que vai ter dublado em português?
solo que los escenarios se vean mas grandees  como en el original porfaa y juegaso del año
¡Un forastero!
The fact that ada isn't in her dress is a massive L. i sleep.
2:12 what? Not coming to ps4?
Will they change the opening where Leon breaks into someone's home and murders an innocent man trying to defend himself from a home invader?
morir es vivir ...XD
The best part of all Re games 😍❤
The best Resident Evil game of all time is finally back!
Is this exclusive to ps5?
the exact same game but with a new hat
POR FAVOR LANCEM LOGO !
No wayy, no tengo la maldita ps5
WELCOME! STRANGER! I'LL BUY IT AT A HIGH PRICE!!
I have high expectations that capcom is gonna do right by us they never disappoint with the remakes
LETS MFKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
I hope they enable subtitles in this one, I wanna know what they're saying in Spanish. If they still do speak it in this one. Other than that, very excited, beat RE4 a bunch, and now theres a remake? Gonna be lit af!
Mi momento ha llegado
Hoping for PS4....
Porfavor no la cagues capcom
Gonna  take a month off work for this one
Pls keep the mexican accent. It was hilarious
Thanks capcom 💕🥺
This is not the Ada I remember from RE4 & RE6 0:54
Help me Leon!!
Dood, if they cut any content off this game like they did on 3 - I'm going ballistic
Cuanto he esperado este momento.
Grass doesn't move when leon goes through at 2:04 😅😅😅
Imagine Dr. Salvador in this game. Almost invincible like Mr.X from RE2R and hunting you during village section of the game.
DETRAS DE TI INBECIL!
Wow... im amazed. Ill try my best to get a ps5 by then so I get to play this masterpiece
SADLER NEEDS A LATINO ACCENT HE SOUNDS LIKE FRICCIN CHRIS PINE 🤣 IT LOOKS AMAZING THO
I really hope it comes to pc.
Hope they don't censore too much of the vioience this time, it contributes to the horror element and definitely crucial to the game
Shut up and take my money!
Por favor quiten ese caminado tonto y teto de Leon, el es hombre Alpha que caminaba como un soldado preparado no como un tonto universitario hacia el campeonato de matemáticas y por último que Ada y Ashley luscan muy lindas y sexys. Espero que no lo arruinen como en RE3 Remake
ps4?
Can't wait to send Ashley hiding in the trash!
si agregan la opcion de dejar inconciente a asley y cargarla como un saco de papatas se convertira en goty del  año :v
Get ready to have this game being re released for 20 years to come
Isso sim é resident evil, espero que seja tão bom quanto o original.
ADA CHWAAAANNNNN!!!! 😍😍😍
Finally, not the greatest, but the one we've all been waiting for!
I am extremely worried about this due to how 4 was in effect a perfect storm. B movie style game with actual horror and campy loveable lines etc. If one of those elements had failed the whole game would have failed.
I love this
Cómo siempre hace CAPCOM lo terminarán anunciando para xone y PS4 2 meses antes del lanzamiento XD
Finalmente 🤣🤣🤣
IM HYPE!!!
The game we all deserve, but nobody asked for.
Capcom não merece mais a confiança do fã de longa data de RE. Só acreditaremos em um bom Resident quando DE FATO jogarmos um. Chega de expectativas com teasers!
I am so hyped! My favourite 'RE game and my favourite boy  are back!!!
Un experimento de Capcom Hizo Hace 17 Años, y que hasta nuestras fechas Salieron Tantas Versiones... Pero en este 2023 tendremos ahora sí, la Versión Definitiva de *RESIDENT EVIL 4*  CAPCOM LA VERDAD LO ESTAS HACIENDO MUY BIEN ÚLTIMAMENTE...👍
DE TRZ DE TÍ IBENCI!!!
You know what? This trailer changed my mind. I was on the side of "RE4 doesn't need a remake".... But I love how (it seems like) they are actually going more into the horror direction for this one. I love how horror focus it is compared to the original goofy action.
PS4?
Nací demasiado tarde para explorar la tierra y demasiado temprano para explorar el universo pero nací justo a tiempo para jugar Resident Evil 4 Remake.
Whadda ya buyin'?
Mojense piperos
Dime que saldra para pc por favor
Ahora esperar que salga el Code Veronica Remake
0:40 apenas vi el 4 en el State of Play, grite tanto que casi se me van las cuerdas vocales, no es bait :')
EU QUERO MUITO VER O ALANZOKA JOGANDO ESSE
Leon heeeeeelp
I was born ready
What a time to be alive!
Un forastero!!!!!!
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
Yesssssssss
can’t wait to see ada 😫
Ok this is fine sure but what we all really want is the Resident Evil 5 remaster. Come on Capcom step it up.
I can not wait!
vaya que recuerdos cuando jugaba este juegazo en los ciber de mala muerte xD  pero se pasaba bien con los panas, ojala el mapa sea igual de grande no pequeño como las otras entregas
Does the very end of this suggest we might be able to play using the RE 1, 2, 3 camera angles?
Innecesario
SIIIIIIIUU😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oh sweet Prince.
The “Welcome” from the merchant at the end wouldve been the icing at the top
Al fin carajo
I imagine that everything will end up in another underground NEST so as not to lose the habit of recycling
che este juego ya lo pase hace mas de 10 años , haber que paso
Comprar
Now this is what I’ve been waiting for Resident Evil 4 is legendary I can’t wait for this
Morir es vivir Morir es vivir Morir es vivir
Pelo trailer deu p reconhecer tudo do original, mt bom. Bem diferente do trailer do 3, q no final das contas o jogo foi uma decepção. Acho que teremos um grande remake dessa vez. Ansioso.
i just want the hate scream of doctor salvador when he attacks
casualmente acabo de comprarlo para Xbox One ayer 😮 será fantastico😃
Legend!
Whyy just for ps5🥲🥲🥲🥲💔💔
cant wait to play this in vr😊
se puso la piel chinita y eso que no mostraron nada  :3
Why. This game doesn't need this. Waste of time.
Welcome back Leon :)
Ready and excited. New most anticipated title.
Hoping after this they can bring back Onimusha and Darkstalkers!
guys, it's happened.
I always said this remake wasn't needed at this point in time, but this looks better than I could ever have thought! I just hope people give it a chance since the last remake (3) wasn't received. But then again, 3 was outsourced since they couldn't balance it with remake 2 and 8, and I do hope Capcom gives it another go, and that the 3rd time is the charm, so that faith in their remakes are restored.
Can't wait for HD "WHADDAJA BOYIN'"
No cut content plz
Já mataram a Asheley bem no trailer obrigado 😆
Мы этого столько ждали…через столько лет….🥹
ps4?
La frase que mas espero de este juego es "Detras de ti, imbecil!!!" XD
lo acabé 50 veces, y el juego también
Se viene la mayor y mejor espera de toda la década. MUCHÍSIMAS GRACIAS, CAPCOM ♥
Hope this is not like resident evil 3 remake
"Whuddya buyin'?" -Uhh, this game!
Hope they didn't ruin it like 3.
VEIO NA MENTE TUDO QUE A GENTE VIVEU LEON 🥵🥵🥵🥵
It's happening 🤯
They'd better keep little person zombie napoleon
ps4 plz❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yooooooooo
Yes!
I hope Ashley is less annoying now.
Mais uns 10 anos de conteúdo pro master reset
It looks great. I just hope people aren't so wrapped up in their 2005 childhood- nostalgia and give this game a chance. Pretend it's not a REmake and judge it accordingly 😌
UN FORASTERO!!
amdksahdjkhajksdjwhajkdjwbdjwkabdaadaswdasaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa FINALMENTEEE
Se viene el: Leon! Ayudame Leon! Leoooooon
o trailer do começo até o fim é escuro, se fosse pra mostrar desse jeito o bagulho então nem mostra,  da pra ver nada.
Yes finally!!!
Go to ps4 plss
One of the best games ever made hope they do it justice’s
I love this but I hate this... Me and my girlfriend love Resident Evil especially 4 and were so excited for the remake to come out... She dumped me earlier today... By the time I'm writing this it has only been 50 minutes since the video came out... If we were together just a few minutes longer I would be sending this link to her as if nothing is wrong... I'm going to miss sending her links...
Aaaaaaaa me da una ataqueee
This isn't RE4.
Brings back  memories, best resident evil I played.
Hopefully they don't get rid of gameplay where you have to protect Ashley and instead relegate her to cut scenes only.  I'm probably in the minority here, but I actually enjoyed having to look out for her.  It made the game more challenging and interesting and it also added to the mood and atmosphere.  Also make me feel like I was playing a more heroic Leon.  I also hope they don't make the game longer since RE3R was (rightfully) slammed for being too shot. I personally think OG RE4 is already way too long (probably also an unpopular opinion) and this came actually COULD be cut in some areas.  I'd be happy with them cutting the island (but keeping the regenerators, of course).
If they cut anything out of the game it’s just gonna ruin it
Capcom! Thank you!!!! 😭😭
I can't wait when we'll facing on those terrifying chainsaw Ganados' again.
Ashley Graham downgrade... Leon Kennedy face downgrade... Ada Wong downgraded to turttleneck...why capcom hate fun.
essas pragas nao sabem fazer jogos novos?
Why did they skip Resident Evil Code Veronica remake?!! That was my favorite of all time
acabe
Oh man, I can't wait for Leons and Louis' fameous lines
I hope they are not cutting corners on this one give us the same length as the ORIGINAL and even more, don´t ruin it like RE3 remake. And sorry but tht Luis sounds awful.
🎊🎉✨🎉🎊🎉🎊✨🎉✨🎊🎉✨🎊🎉✨
I wonder what’ll happen if they ever make it to 5.
1:15 Mano na moral com essa vilinha aqui vai é floopar ....Issu mais parece um quintal de um Sitio do que a vila do RE4 kkkkkk  É PEDIR D+ fazer igual 95% do jogo e 5% de mundaças 😮‍💨😑
Evil 4 😭🤯
I don’t know man, it looks rather claustrophobic? Maybe that’s the point but the environment looks cramped
I hope they don't remove the regenerador
I love this game just like 17 years ago！
Um sonho realizado 😍 esse que pra mim é o melhor Residentevil , já quero jogar
Saldrá en Steam?
Que tontería,y seguro será en primera persona,en vez de darle el remake a Dinocrisis o parasite evil.salen a cagar está joya,como sucedió con el re3
Morir es vivir
Nice but  I'm definitely gonna pirate since I got duped on the re 3 remake though
Exclusivo ps5??ps5 exclusive???
There's no ps4 version?..
Yes Finally I knew this time will come, Resident Evil 4 Great Game.
Resident Evil 4 Ethnic cleansing boogaloo
UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPPPPP ALELUYA
Leooonn helpppp leoonn helpppp ..
Nice !!!!!!🙈🙈🙈🙈😘😘
Who else is keen to buy this new version of Resident Evil 4 at least 6 more times over the next few years?
I'm literally crying
I can't wait to see Salazar and the Verdugos in this one!
Biggest question of all does Ashley do something useful?
" um forasteiro "
Otra vez??? Ya no tienen otro?? O solo el 4??? Lastima por Capcom
O JOGO DA MINHA VIDA e vai ter remake SIMMM, não consigo explicar o espírito de toda minha infância com esse jogo reinando em mim
I need song intro, please!!!!
Looks so much like a remaster instead of a remake, which we all were hoping for
Dios mío 😭
Pleeeease make this game succeed the original as if it was RE1Make not like RE3Make.
I didnt want a remake/remaster of this........but my mind has officially been changed
I hope they learn from RE3 remake and don't cut a lot.👌
The original is possibly my favorite game of all time.  It really deserves the modern AAA remake treatment. I’m so happy this is happening! 🥹
meh
NO WAY I HAD TO PINCH MYSELF SEVERAL TIMES WHEN I SAW THIS IM SOOOO HYPED THIS IS MY FAVORITE THING EVER
Leon HELP!!!!!!!!
Prevejo esse jogo sendo relançado pra ps6, ps7,ps8 também.
jogo incredible, será que has to ps4? 🖤
why make new games if remakes give as much money!? ugh...
❤❤❤❤❤
I can already hear the "Help me Leon!"
This is such a bad idea! 😖
I hope this version will not cut a lot of stuff from the original, but will be longer, much longer to install an ambiance. I hope they will not make the same mistakes of the 3 remake.
Só vem,monstro!
Cant wait to see how Capcom does with RE5. Are they gonna race swap the african enemies xD
:D
Can’t wait for Leon’s bingo line to be interrupted like Jill’s stars line.
hijos se la verga no lo hagan exclusivo para ps5
🗿👌🏻
Please Just don’t cut out to much content from the original
No puedo creer que ya esté casi listo!!
Everytime Capcom releases a Resident Evil game, they act like it's something we've never seen before. They think we're dumb bro. They always have a character speaking softly but seriously in their trailers, just to add to the spooky aesthetics. Capcom ain't foolin' no one.
PQP ELA VOLTOU.~Leon Help!~
Pls more horror
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO QUE LOCURAAAA
I'm loving that they are leaning into the horror aspect. One thing I always hated about RE4 is how cartoonish it got towards the end with Salazar lol. I hope the remake keeps things more grounded and maybe less action that looks like a michael bay movie
I wanna see MOMMY ADA NOW 😤
MEU DEUS
COMOO QUE SIII QUEUEEEEEEEE SIIIIIIIIIIIIII
I'm not ready for resident evil 4 remake, because I hate PS5 and I don't have it. 👎
Yes.  Yes yes yes yes yes yes gimme gimme gimme gimme take ALL of my money just GIMME.
i will buy and play it. but is other resident evil games that need the remake treatment alot more than the 4th
i wish i could buy a ps5 cuz my family are so poor i hope someday ill be success n help my family then buy a ps5
Seguiremos masacrando a comunidad mexicana afincada en los Pirineos??
Where is everyone going..?
hello childhood
NÃO DA PRA ACREDITAR, UM JOGO QUE FEZ PARTE DA MINHA INFANCIA, E AGORA VOU TER O PRAZER DE REJOGA-LO EM ALTA QUALIDADE, HYPE É DE MAIS DE 8000.
im literally crying
I'm so excited I grew up playing re4 and it's finally getting a remake got me shed a tear a little bit
اوف
this is the game that made me start the Resident Evil series and even the crappy movies and tv shows. This is a legendary game and this remake should have people at the same level of excitement as FF7's remake if not more.
The game is looking great, It's clear that they took a lot of inspiration from Resident Evil 3.5, with a darker atmosphere, but still faithful to the original. I just hope Capcom don't mess it up this time.
ive never been more excited for a RE game. i grew up replaying re 4 for years and have beat it countless times, cant wait to see what they do with it
This better not be a PS exclusive
Es hora de asplastar
Tô sonhando só pode
Can't wait to see Leon's badassery
Ya se tardaban en sacar una nueva versión.
UN FORAAAASTEROO
I want to see the mine cart level in this one.
Is this exclusive or pc and other platforms also ?
Juegazo papá en hora buena.
No ps4? F0ck 0ff ill play it via torrent on pc
แอชลี่ย์ โอเค๊!!! แจ่มมมมมมมม หวังว่าคงไม่กรี๊ดบ่อยเหมือนเวอร์ชั่นเก่านะครับ
no way
Y el Rockman Match? 👀
Capcom....don't you dare f*ck this up. I bought RE4 at least 5 times now, let's make this the 6th. 😊
Vivir es morir
Missed opportunity not having a shady character say " hehe hehe welcome...." at the end of the trailer.
I love how there was no build up, just right into it.
I NEED A PS5!!!!! 🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿
As someone who's never played the original I'm looking forward to trying this
OLÉ
Maaaan, I really wanna see and RE1 remake in the RE Engine
Espero que sea fiel al original, esperaba a ver al doctor salvador al final😫
Where did we all go, bingo night?
Hoy es mi cumpleaños #18 y está noticia me pone muy feliz ya q RE4 fue uno de mis juegos favoritos, uno q marco mi infancia y comenzó mi adicción a esta maravillosa saga cm
BROOOOO FINALLY
LETS GOOOOOO
So hype!
espero que não seja cortado nada
Morir es vivir...
I cried tears of joy. Because one of my favorite games is getting a remake. I can't wait to hear the words "what are ya buying?" Again!
Listos para jugar el nuevo resident hasta en el cereal :v
quien es la minita?
The day of My birthday😈
un forastero
Why didn't they use Paul Mercier's voice again?
I knew it this really is the RE Renaissance
I was 14 when I played RE4 on the gamecube. I was so scared, I had to take breakes every 2 hours or so. I finshed the game and I loved it. I wanna play Leon Kennedy and Ashley again.
“WHAT ARE YOU BUYING?”
Capcom run out of ideas?
Grande RE4
Ojala no borren enemigos como hicieron con el 3, ya solo me imagino al dr salvador en el remake :3
Se percibe una atmósfera de más horror (espero),  exclusivo ya de PS5 (ya no sale para PS4) ahora si Konami tirame un silent Hill 🙏🏻y ahora si listo para comprar un PS5
poderia ser o Code Veronica, mas não... mais uma vez essa joça aí.
As long as they keep Ashley's ballistics, I'll be happy.
vivir es morir
I swear they make a resident evil 4 each year or am I tripping
mientras salga para ambss generaciones de consolas yo contento, ya que se me hace aún muy corto el tiempo para que dejen de sacar juegos para la anterior generación
This looks very promising
No la caguen por favor, es considerado el mejor juego de la franquicia.
GOTY SEÑORESSSSS
ufff banda los rule que se vienen de ashley
Si no fuera por que posiblemente podria sacar 1 lap en el buen fin solo por este juego romperia 2 reglas que tengo no comprar 1 consola de salida y no comprar 1 consola por 1 juego
I believe this is a combo of the castle RE4 with the RE4 we know just to expand on the RE4 genre. The game looks amazing. I cannot wait for the preordering.
PREYDOG mod will be amazing with this one
Que nostalgia será volverlo a jugar
Merchant: what are ya buying? Me: Dat RE4 preorder!
Cara tá parecendo que esse vai ser mais terror que o original,, hypei muito
nope without Paul Mercier as Leon im not gonna play that game....
El Gigante or we riot
Well we already have Resident evil 2 and 3 remake so might as well make a remake of Resident evil 4.
Resident Evil 4's official remake is finally coming out!!!!!!!! LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2023 Gaming is loaded 🔥
Can capcom stop with the remakes and gives an actual new leon game  I really miss the dude
Donde estaran esas personas que decian que jamas saldria un RE4 remake?
I did not hear anybody say "What are ya buying" and that is very disappointing
NEM FUDENDO, NEM FUDENDO CARALHO, CARALHO NEM FUDENDO
Please please don’t tell me they didn’t cut hella content tho
I hope some of the campyness remains. It's what made RE4 such a classic. They seem to be pushing a horror vibe.
"What are ya buyin?"
Esperamos uma dublagem em PT/Brazil condizente com um dos melhores game.
se me paro el pico
I hope they keep some of the cheesy dialogue.
Bingo???
I'd wish they would let the production in this one mature a couple more years, I wouldnt mind waiting goddamit. RE4 is so special to me and I can't help thinking that CAPCOM is doing this just for the money.
Please hope Ashley is less annoying 😂
bom divertimento pra quem tem condições de ter Ps5
Wow jack krauser my love 😍😍😗😙😙😙😙
Got something that might interest ya! Heh heh heh!
Skeptical...I didn't hear the spanish accent in any of the npc characters. Luis for example, he doesn't have it.
This remake seems to have the same bland tone of RE8 and Leons serious dialogue implies a removal of the cheesiness that made classic RE4 so endearing. I know that's a lot to assume in only two minutes, but I already don't expect this game to live up to the original.
Don't tell me the game is not available on ps4 ?
Razón para estar vivoooooo 🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽😆😆😆😆😆😆🥹😭😭😭😭🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
“Es un forastero!”
COMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
AAAAA QUE EMOCIÓOOONN, LOCOOOO ❤❤❤✨✨
I hope they didn't cut any content like in re3
cant wait.
Vamos Españita 🇪🇸
If there’s one game that does not need to be remade, it’s resident evil 4.
THEY GAVE THE BOLD DUDE A HAT
El rey ha vuelto.  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Here’s hoping to a more competent Ashley Graham.
If they get rid of the tank controls ill play this game 10 times over!
Why did they change Ada Wongs dress? Can you please make that at least a downloadable content because I really don't like the outfit you used on her out of Resident Evil 6.
Hype!
Capcom u rat, bring somethin new, not another repost >:^/
JUUUUJUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
I KNOW IT'S HAPPENING OMFG, CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS 😍😍🔥
My favorite game!  A don't believe
*Please come to PS4*
I'm so excited :')
Cant wait to play the bingo minigame with Sadler
SONYFOREVER
Couldn't they just go back and fix the RE3 Remake?
Maaaan they better have more ps5s available next year
Lets goooooo
*" WELCOME! "* *" Whaddaya buyin? , Whaddaya sellin ? "* *" NOT ENOUGH PTAS STRANGER "*
I really hope the spanish zombies still say "detrás de ti imbécil"
morir es vivir, morir es vivir ...................
Just gimme those regenerators, el gigantes, fastest zombie alive, chainsawman, mosquito zombies and i wish ashley will be less annoying this time
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
ÉPICO, ÉPICO, ÉPICO! ♥♥♥
Now here's the big question...is Leon gonna get Luis's name right this time?
F Yeah man, the game that I still play on a weekly basis since it got out on PS2
¡Un forastero !!!!!!!!!!!
But can I play it with a WiiMote?
KEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEH YO DIJE ESTO ES REAL ?¡
I hopee SOO much That game is as long as the original one because resident evil 3 remake is really short and the original was faaar from Loong
At the beginning of the video, when they were slowly revealing the letter "N", I thought they were announcing some Netflix series 😂
Finally Resident Evil 4!!!
Day 1!!!
Legit never played any of the Resident Evils. I used to absolutely love to watch the movies tho. Maybe I’ll start soon.
le di duro en la play 2 👀
Quedé pal pico
Ashley is really cute................ Wow
Everyone’s hyped about what we’ve seen so far, but I don’t think we’re ready for Del Lago and Verdugo. They’re literally going to be the most scariest thing ever.
Would love to see Resident Evil 1 in remake format.
Ashley :” LEOOONNNNNNNNN!!!!! HeeeeeeelPpPPpPpPppPPpPpp!                 LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!”.
Finalmente, un buen juego luego de una espera eterna de mierda
My childhood :(
This Is What I`m Looking For
Is that RE2 Remake's Leon voice actor?
LEON HELP !!!
Pet peeve... Leon's outfit looks mad baggy
Played RE4 on the Wii and ever since then, I have played this game on every console it had been released on, even iPad and Nintendo switch lol. I love RE4 to death and can't wait to get my hands on Re4 Remake!!!!!!
Really Really i can't wait for this
I never played a resident evil game, but I hear that 4 is the best one, if not the best game ever period.
Didn't we already get a resident evil 4 remastered? I lost track...
Cant wait to hear that annoying "LEOOOON HEEEELP" again.
I've watched this while wiping my tears with 10 miles worth of tissue .
A que nos vuelva a castrar Ashley, si señor ♥️
Woooooooooooow finalmente!!!
¡OLEEE! 💃
Morir es vivir :v
I was introduced to this series via the PS4 version of the original RE 4 only a couple years back, so this is seriously intriguing to me.
I thought resident evil was made by Namco?
Does this mean we are getting a code Veronica remake? Seems silly to make an RE5 remake...But if you're going to redo all of them...might as well, maybe fix 6?
Morir es vivir, Morir es vivir, Morir es vivir, Morir es vivir, Morir es vivir
Esclusivo de next gen o también sale para ps4?
y yo que me iba a matar, y salio este juego, y en un año mas, igual lo veo siendo un fantasma o espiritu?
Um yes
アシュリー可愛い
I'm literally going to faint
Idk. Re4 wasn't old enough for me to want a remake... I would have loved a remake of Resident evil X code Veronica
Seeeeeeee re4 😭😭😭😭😭 seeee a hora si vale la pena comprar la ps5 :'D
This made me want to buy ps5
💙❤️
I’m so excited for this remake brb replaying re4 now
Muchachos hora de ponerse de traje
I don't even know how to react to this. I played the original more times than I can tell ya
esto es oficial?
resident evil 6 still for me the best
You're not being f'ing serious right..? this is exlusive?
No mames solo será para PS5? Y PS4 que onda
I saw this coming a mile away I'm excited but a tiny bit disappointed at the same time I was more so hoping for a Code Veronica remake but I'll take this
I don't like the new Saddler's voice.
LEOONN
Capcom is already calling a reimagining… :( I’m excited for this. But please Capcom tons cut content like you did with 2 and 3. Specially 3.
I've beat this game SO MANY times ! I hope it will be as close as possible to the original RE 4, if not better !
who didn't see this coming
また空耳アワードを聞けるのだろうか
What number are we at now? The resident evil franchise might be the most confusing chronology in gaming other than final fantasy.
Jaja las guitarras españolas XD
I just screamed like a girl
افضل لعبه في تاريخ صناعة الالعاب اتمنى ان لا تخيب آمالي
LEONNN HELPPP, HELP ME LEON
Anybody else play this on GameCube enough to unlock the Handcannon and the P.R.L. 412?
woooooo
No have cash strange !!!!
What are you selling?
Grandee qenkk!! vamos que se viene un bombazo para PS5. saldrá para PS4??? sería beneficioso que saliera para PS4 ya que mucha gente lo compraría.
Hopefully they can find a way to make Luis live
Now waiting for the 5th
I'm fuking like this game just like 17 years ago!
Esperen ... Será exclusivo de PS?
all i know is the "where's everyone going, bingo?" line better stay in there
I see we're going for horror > everything the og was
I was right all along after RE 2 Remake when people wanted 4 Remake. I said 2023 mark my words :)
Hope they don’t forget about CODE VERONICA
AHI ESTÁ!  UN FORASTERO!  TE VOY A HACER PICADILLO  que buenos recuerdos :'D
Hope they'll cut the army men island and go straight to Saddler after the Krauser fight and some regenerators. The last bit was too stretched out even for this masterpiece. Like the Ashley driving part and the minigun hide into cover bits
They're changing the tone of the original and thats my biggest fear for now... taking it super serious this time...
We need a mute button for Ashley this time
Leonnnnnnnnnnnn helpppppppppppp
If they remove a single Le-one-liner I'm gonna riot
More realistic + More gore = Better gameplay
Boooooo This game does not need a remake Maybe a remaster (maybe) But not a remake.. come on it's just gonna disappoint everyone
Que delícia cara...
Que gráficos !
Hoy revivió el Gaming, GOTY 2023 Caballeros 🧐😎👌!
LEEEOOOONNNNNN !!!!!
Pleaaase make it the same way you did with RE2 remake and not like RE3 remake
I hope Serenity is still the safe room music in this game. If not then a remade version of the typewriter music would work as a substitute!
Its so cool to see Leon with his hook man Jacket and Ashley with  her re4 beta outfit .
was that Mendes in the hallway
I teared up 20 seconds in y’all
¡Un forastero!
meeehhhhh
Does anyone know if it will be available to play on Xbox consoles?
I'm glad i didn't buy the original on ps5 when it was on sale I'll just wait for this version. Re 2 and 3 remakes were awesome.
¿¿¿¿WHYYYYYYYY????
Here’s a small breakdown:  - Leon’s design is mostly intact - Ada has been redesigned, her outfit looks similar to RE6 Ada - Ashley looks mostly intact, but it’s too dark to be sure. - A runaway flashback with Ashley or a small gameplay with Ashley running away (like RE7 Mia)? - House protection section? - Luis Sera will be in the game, but he has also been redesigned, wearing a leather coat - Osmund Saddler is in the game (duh) - Villagers and Cultists returned - Del Lago returned - 1:29 I don’t know who that is, but it might be Chief Mendez considering the tall stature. - Disturbing carcasses returned?  - The game might be different in tone, Leon’s might be less of a cheesy action hero and instead more serious - The game seems to focus more on horror than the original.
What the actual Goosebumps!! my whole body is vibrating
I’ve always wanted to play the original RE4 but the controls were just too big of a turn off. I’m definitely excited for this!
I hope its tone is not changed much yk.
I love it ♥️ I feel like this might be right after what happened with re3r
I'm very skeptical, unlike RE 2 and 3 which haven't been remade since Gamecube RE4 has been rereleased already and basically pioneered the style the remakes are using. Also Saddler and Luis don't have their accents which takes away a lot of the charm for me.
So we're just gonna pretend code veronica didnt happen then?
We need to see Leon face!😱
Cacete! se a Capcom não vier com historia de reimaginação, vai ser TOP.
I'm so exited for this...
this aint the ordinary RE game so i hope they keep the same game length and improve on everything else. so hyped for this
Nah Ada didn’t have her red dress, I’m out
feels a little too soon. The time and difference between Resident Evil 1 remake and RE 2 Remake are vastly different then the time between RE 2 remake to 3 and now 4. It use to be special to see these remakes, now it just meh when they show up. i'm half expecting an RE 5 remake 1-3 years after the release of RE 4 remake.
Talk about an unecessary remake. 🙄
The best game i ever played in my whole life 🥰🥰
"This time, it can be different... it has to."  As a remake of a perfect game, it certainly does.
Brasil 🇧🇷🇧🇷
What have they done !!! His jacket collar is folded down ….. this is already off to a bad start, collar up please fix this asap
wheres etham winters
Entonces esta wea es real o no?
Please please please have co-op!!!
I don't want to nitpick, but...Could they, this time, make the spanish enemies speak actual "Spain-Spanish" and not mexican?      No es que me importe demasiado, pero daba mucho el cante...
Its ashame they didn't get the other voice actor but i like this one too
eu jurei que eu nunca mais daria dinheiro pra capcom mas não vou poder cumprir meu juramento
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑
Great, can’t wait to hear “ LEOOOON HAALLLP. HELP ME LEON” again driving me insane. 🤪
pena, é o jogo q matou a franquia... podiam ter ido no code veronica, esse precisa de um remake
No way Bro
Fuaa revivire mi infancia en 4k
Ashley is beautiful
Obrigado meu Deus por estar vivo para poder ver isso 🥹
I better be able to play as a girl some how or imma be real upset
Amo esse jogo marco minha infância, quero muito fazer série no meu canal de resident evil 4 amo essa franquia ❤🎮⚡  Ainda bem que n tirarão minha personagem favorita(ADA WONG)❤❤
No more "hey! what are you looking at!?"
Hopefully we can play as luis in this remake
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💖❤❤💖💖💖❤💖💖💖❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💖❤❤💖❤❤💖💖❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤demais po...
Soy yo o no se ve como juego de ultima generacion
i’ve never actually played RE4 and have been waiting for the inevitable RE make of it so now the time is finally at hand! hope it lives up to the hype.
I'm playing this game in the hardest mold because I made a mistake with resident evil two and three it was too easy well to his little bit hard because I was scared about Mr. X I don't remember Mr. X in the PlayStation one version that much
Un forastero !!!
I cannot believe it
Por favor que lo agan bien🙏
"Where's everyone going... Bingo?"
i hope it's different from the other remakes, and this time they make it as long as the original, i don't really want to spend 50€ for a game that takes only 2 - 4 hr to finish.
Queeeeeeeeeeeeeee isssooooooooo Top de mais
Imagine skipping Code Veronica
But why?
RE4 is considered by many as one of the greatest games ever made. Tough to fill these shoes.  Hope they can pull at least a decent game, but I am skeptical. Idk, something feels off about this trailer.
We knew it was coming
This game is definitely going to be Solid, but it’s unnecessary
RE4 as a horror game? Color me interested.
They will definitely remove content here. RE4 is a long game. If they really want to keep that "realistic" tone/approach they've been using for the remakes, then some things from the original RE4 had to go... I only hope that they choose wisely in what to keep, because there are a lot of things that may look stupid by today's standards (Salazar, certain places of the castle, some bosses) but have become so iconic that I can't imagine RE4 without them.. this is truly a risky move, not financially but in an artistic/cultural point of view
ya me antojaron
yess, now they gotta remake 5 & 6
Quién más quiere que vuelva el "Detrás de tí Imbécil!"? 😜
VENCEMOS FAMILIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I'm excited!
I wonder how Ashley's scream this time will be like.
With each remake i keep wondering if they ll ever do one for 5 and 6? Could u imagine a complete overhaul into actual horror? Id love to see what those games could become and actually stand on par with the rest of the series. I also wouldnt mind a re-remake of 1 but for now im just hyped for RE4
i wonder when theyll stop with all these remakes, maybe re5...??? idk i highly doubt theyll go all the way to a re6 remake
Блин супер просто, я надеюсь что это будет не только эксклюзив для пс5
I guess Resident Evil 4 is Capcom's version of Skyrim.
Code Veronica deserved way more this remake.
Let's just hope they don't bring back the repetitive "Leon, help!!!" lines
Esta parte de mi vida, esta pequeña parte, se llama felicidad :’) 🥹
Oh capcom, I love you from the bottom of my heart ❤️.
Still no Bloodborne remaster 😮‍💨
Re4444
cant wait to play it
The hype is real.
Un forastero !!!
Ojalá que estabas aslhey sirva de algo
no lo puedo crer
aqui esta
Não faça isso nao me de esperança 🥺
They better either A: Make Ashley more survivable and less stupid than the original or B: Let us shoot her once and for all. :P Looking forward to it though.
😃😃😃😃👏👏👏👏🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️
WELCOME
“Leon, save me Leon!”
Cool new looks aside, I really hope Ashley is a bit less helpless and annoying.
DINO CRISIS WHERE ARE YOU???????????????????????????????????????????
Am dreaming right?
They should hace ended the traiñer with "detrás de ti, imbecil"
People preordering this game: “AGARRENLOOOO”
already bothered by it because they put in sunlight in a game renowned for being gray and grimey cause las plagas hate sunlight
Sólo espero qué Wesker siga teniendo el estilo ya conocido y no quieran meter al rey wakanda o algo parecido.
Tranquilos!! Tenemos 10 meses para conseguir una PS5......🤔
Its ashame we can't get Leon's original voice, F to the legend But I'm seriously excited
Will there be more new contact available for PS4?
Now this looks amazing can't wait
Ohhh the release date is a pallendrome!!!👀👀👀
I really wish they remake Code Veronica before RE4
50 times i play this game another 10 times doesn't Matter
YOOOOOO!
Uma pena que eu não vou poder jogar =(
Esperando o Cross reagir hehe
Another remake! Whats this, remake number 4 of the same game?
Ashley: Leon!!! help me Leon!!!  Leon: I'am coming  Ashley!! 😂😂😂
Show de bola.
To be butchered
Why is the bit at 0:46 live action?
Meu deus 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Ashley my Beloved, I’m happy to see you in 4K. Can’t wait for you to scream in my ear again
The way the video starts made my mexican grandma rise from her grave and start dancing ardently...
Well. On the one hand I am super pleased to see a reimaging of resident evil 4. Come ON man! CODE VERONICA!!!
Resident Evil 5 is probably next to get the remake treatment.
Resident Evil 4 is the best part of all series and we were waiting for this remake for a very long time and now the time has come! It will make us frenetic when we play this masterpiece altogether!
I hope they make a really big ones like the original to Ashley Graham.
Eu nunca esperei tanto por esse momento!!!!!
Eu devo estar sonhando. PQP!!!!!!
only for ps5 huh 😑
J'AI HURLÉ DANS MON APPARTEMENT
Hora de volver a españa
Matalo!
Hoping this time that they don't cut out so much stuff like they did with 3
Will buy
Fkn amazing 😍
I learned my lesson with re3. no preorder for this game. wait couple days to see if anything is cut
Am I the only one who feels like this is a terrible idea? The original was a masterpiece and I feel like this one is just going to ruin it. Remakes of 2 and 3 were understandable, because those games came out at the dawn of 3d gaming. But Re4 HD edition is still a fantastic game that holds up to this day.
Was that Claire? I know obviously Ashley, but u meant early on in the trailer
Me cagué encima cuando vi el anuncio, yo ya me iba a dormir y ahora duerme mi pinche vieja jeje
Leave it to Capcom to yank me out of my pit of depression. I will be thinking of nothing else until March 24, 2023.
Why don't they just make a new game?! Re4 got real stupid, real fast. The last 80% of that game is ducking garbage. 🗑
finally.. the one remake we've been waiting so long for..
They are going to cut half the game out and charge 69.99 for it
Espero que sea para play 4 también 😔
Just keep the spanish insults pls.  The ganados were really kind to tell us hispanics that they were going to make us picadillo :DD
Andamos finos señoras y señores🤑🤙
I love you Play station
It's finally here!!! (I'm not a bot)
I can't wait to harass Ashley again!!!
Increible, solo espero ver todoos los grandes escenarios que nos brindo el juego original <3
New Ashley model 😩
ESTOY GRITANDO COMO NENA POR ESTO DIOS LO QUE ESTUVE ESPERANDO, CAPCOM TE AMOOO
Solo espero que conserven el mítico "Detrás de ti imbesil !"
LA TENGO RE PARADA TE AMO CAPCOM
What you buying  What you selling  Bring my g back 🥹🥹🥹
AGARALO!
it will also come out for ps4
Just give me those juiced up suplex animations powered by the glory of RE Engine
Se hizo realidad nuestro sueño
otro refrito mas, parecen televisa con sus novelas KK
KARALHOOOOOOOOWWW
Al fin re4 remake un sueño echo realida
Finalmente o Remake do 4 se revelou, agora é esperar esses 9 meses até Março, pelos gráficos já valeu apena.
😍
queeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, lo espero con todas las ansias del mundo aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
Que buena música, me ha alegrado el día este anuncio
este trailer es la prueba de que ya no existe la originalidad
I can't believe this is real... It looks fantastic!
Definitely HYPED for this! Getting this along with PSVR2.
Por un momento pensé que era fake, pero se me puso la piel de gallina al ver a los iluminados dando miedo Xd
any chance of ps4 port?
UN FORASTERO
please don't remove the brown tint please don't remove the brown tint please don't remove the brown tint please don't remove the brown tint please don't remove the brown tint please don't remove the
Eu quero morar nesse trailer tô tremendo
joder al fin
Remake again?   Well let's see  Hope it's not heavily cut like Re 3
INCREDIBLE!!
you did it, i will be forced to buy the ps5
YOOOOO been waiting for this since RE2 remake came out! the hype is real!
💯😢😢
They better not cut half of thr game out
No one cares, make a remake of Code Veronica already.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Let's be honest RE Engine makes everything looks dope, let's hope this time won't get a RE3R length.
I hope they keep the sexual comments and the chemistry between Ashley and Leon
Waiting for my favourite game 😍😍😍
No, Im not hearing that scream again
I wonder if we’re going to have any things added to the game from the original, like the suplex or the kick
I love video games
I’m sooo hypedddd
I hope this one will have ragdoll physics. I don't know why they gave up on in in biohazard and village.
H Y P E D !!!!!!!
I think in order to keep the action horror vibes,they might make it similar to the RE7 Chris DLC
Ahora los españoles hablaran como españoles.
I wanna see the merchant, can you imagine if he references the merchant in RE8
Se ve prometedor la verdad . aunque si es cierto que si quieren reescribir la historia no todo tiene que ser igual que el Original . solo me gustaría que también fuera largo
Ojalá no sea como el resident evil 3 que en vez de agregarle nuevo contenido lo recortaron solo espero no decepcionarme con el resident evil 4
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️por fin
I can’t wait to play re4 with Leon being more in line with the original re2 and remake as Leon post og re4 was seriously a different character
😯😯😯😯😯😯😯
Ashley Graham simps! En Garde!
I really don't understand why release a remake of this game if it has already been released on almost all consoles since the GameCube but i'll still buy it lol
Why does it feel like resident evil 4 is being released for the fourth time.
Obrigado Capcom ❤
Mientras leon se vea igual de guapo que resident evil 4 original está bien 🥵
Yessir, all time favorite game
RE4 VR is my favourite version so far, curious if this'll be better than it.
IM SO EXICTED! I CANT WAIT TO SEE MORE OF THIS GAME
my fav game of all time 🥺
It looks like they're going for a more horror experience, and I love it
اخشى ان يكون فاشل مثل 3
Nunca fui triste🛐🛐
And now we've come full circle, back to the game that changed so much and set the bar for the action-horror genre!
Sinceramente... Eu não pensei que iria dizer isso quando viesse, mas estou sem o menor hype...
❤️❤️
I'm surprised they didn't show Leon getting his head chopped off by Chainsaw Boy as I call him at some point in this trailer, they did show that in the classic trailer even though that death animation didn't go all the way through
This better not be like RE3 remake bruh smh
LUIS ahhhhhhh I’m fanboying so hard, my ballistics are on high alert right now.
Херня полная! Где графика 2022 го года, вы что там в  2000 застряли?  Вообще испортился резидент пипец! Давайте играть теперь в него на плэйстэйшан 1!)))
Don't you dare cut the ballistics like capcom! For the love of everything holy
ｐｓ４でも出してください！！お願いします！！
Esto es una de las cosas por las cuales muchos nos emocionamos mucho y esperamos por mucho tiempo!!!! No puedo esperar para ver como luce el Dr salvador y los regeneradores
I know there's an impulse to remake games people pretty much universally adored, but I really hope Capcom doesn't skip Code Veronica during this RE: Remake era.
Acaban de revivir la infancia de muchos :')
So excited for this, tho I am a bit disappointed it's not launching this year.
Queremos que Popeye Saavedra vuelva a hacer su famoso doblaje
gracias capcom, por sacar mi resident evil favorito, este juego que marco en mi infancia, ya quiero que salga!!!!!!!!
meu deus
I can’t stand Leon’s new voice actor. Didn’t like him in REmake 2, or Infinite Darkness, and I’m sure this isn’t gonna change my mind. All that being said, I’m still excited for this remake.
Still upset about RE3, but whatever
Will I buy it a 10th time? Indeed, indeed I will.
Estado:         excitado🤒
Leon help me 4k. What a bust 🤣🤣🤣
I hope this mean we’ll finally get the next gen update for the other resident evil
al finnn
Can't wait to see Ashley underwear with 4K HD
Reaisent Evil 4 es uni de los mejores juegos de la historia. Espero el remake este minimo al nivel
finally❤
I literally just replayed the original too. This is awesome!
Only PS5? Come onnnnnnn... lame
WOAH
Sei que não vou poder jogar porém o ALANZOKA concerteza vai jogar em live e isso já é mais que o suficiente.
I CAME
Wow
Not gonna lie it was the Hinca P animations that got me interested in this game
Depois da merda que voces fizeram com o R3 remake, nenhum outro lançamento da franquia vai empolgar mais de verdade mesmo!!!!ao inves de fazer remakes pq nao remasterizam os games ? voces iriam encher o bolso de dinheiro mas preferem passar vergonha e fazer esse joguinhos meia boca.
Please i beg you, don't do to this what you did to RE3 remake! It's too precious!
love this. BUT I need the old Leon voice actor not the new one :(   And Ashley looks terrible. Where are the curves?
3rd Person PLEASE
If they don't give Leon some of the greatest one liners I have ever heard in my life, I will cry the entire time I play it.
IIIIII RESIDENT EVIL 4 REMAKE MLK😲😲😲
1:28  Mommy
Never got a chance to play the original game but I'm hoping I get to do so soon for this game and the new remake quite soon! Loved the Remake of Re2 and RE Village so I'm hoping to play all of them!
Agradecido
Yo. I'm jacked. I love the direction its different which is what i want. The older game holds up fine I'll go back and play it. I'm glad its not a rehash.
ADAAAA
Bring on Outbreak!
not a huge fan of the voice no kap
po tristao que nao vai sair pro ps4
Rip Ada dress ):
nice, but the gamecube version has more trees.
Hopefully Ashley won't be annoying this time
imma be honest compared to the other remakes im not really impressed re1 remake looked better imo
LETS GOOOOOO
Let's hope Ashley is more than just the damsel in distress this time...
Still weird to me that they're skipping Code Veronica, arguably the entry in the franchise that could've most benefitted from a full remake.
Yes 😁
Espero que mantenha as falas clássicas dos Ganado. "un forastero" nostalgia pura!
Agr e só rezar pra sair pro Play 4
I hope Capcom will keep Leon sarcastic. I loved his brand of humor in the original re 4.
I’m so excited to hear Leon’s roasts to Salazar remastered
MANO EU VO CHORAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I just hope Capcom made Ashley less annoying
LEONNNNN HELPPPPPPP
EITA CARAI HOJE TEM
liOnnNnnnNNNNnnn
Aaahhhhhhhhhhhh
Yes!
la razon por la que me comprare ps5
I am so excited
falto la vocecita de la intro "RESIDEN IVOL FOR" XD
I can't wait for  "Leon help!" "What are you buying"
Dios que felicidad me da ver esto
Si alguien que vio esto habla español vio esto me moje
Looks cool. I just hope they'll remaster the whole game instead of leaving out a bunch of stuff, including what was in the Gamecube original, like they did with RE4:VR.
Let’s go! Was waiting for this after playing re2 remastered.
Is it on ps4 ??!
infelizmente sairá pra Playstation 5, puts
The greatest Resident Evil game of all time getting remade?! OH YES I AM SO HYPED!
"What're ya buyin?"  This game next year.
They should have done cv and then stop
I wanna cry right now I waited for this for so long
1:58 IT WOULD BE BETTER TO HAVE A REAL PHOTO OF THE GIRL THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD GIVE THE GAME MORE REALISM THE PHOTO DOESN'T CONVINCE ME
The real worry is after the VR issues of cutting dialogue censoring xoming into this one, Sony standards are a real worry to what they will affect or not
Ps4
solo los 2 cosas: que Ashley sea mas inteligente y que los ganado hablen en español de españa........................
"this does put a smile on my face"
Si si si ya tengo play 4 y podré jugarlo siiii
😮😮😮😮🔥🔥🔥🔥
I hope they didn't remove last Jet-Ski glitch.
Agh.. I don't have a PS5..
Awesome
Ohoho love to see the horror vibe. 9 months of wait, I’m sure there’ll be more updates to this and also the long tiresome news of Village DLC.
タイトルが日本のバイオ表記になってるよ
Yeeaaahh
este juego y unos fasito CHAOOOOO
Our Hype!!!!
Ojala no la caguen con literalmente el RE mas querido.
I’m glad they didn’t changed too much from Leon face from re2 and kept nick as the same actor they hype is real boys !
Forastero 🤌🏻
they are messing around , they will ruin a masterpiece , the game don't need a remake , they must foucus on creating new games instead of remaking
Resident evil 4 remake
NEM FUDENDO VEY
UNBELIEVABLE
Hope this lives up to the original. resident Evil 4 is probably my favorite resident evil game
Sei não em...
Seems way to serious. Where is that classic RE4 humor? :(
no gameplay=no hype. says the bibble.
bueno pero que ashley haga algo
Why are his pants so baggy
Yeah, well, the state of play of the trailer looks ok.  How about showing us the state of play of the game?
Este é o momento que os homens voltam a ser garotos e os garotos descobrem oque é ser homem !!!
Oh boy.....they are playing with fire. But ok, RE2 remake was fantastic, so they might hit this one out of the park
Take my money
Ashley doesn't look like Ashley, it looks like she had a sister
My only gripe is I wish we still had Paul Mercier as Leon but this looks super promising
Just give me my merchant and Leon's one liners and I'm all set CAPCOM, take my money
It was a childhood trauma back then, now I have a chance to face it as an adult.
When I saw this live I thought it was gonna be RDR remake/remaster. Lol
VAAAAMOOOSSSS BOCAAAAAA
Hope they keep the comedy bits. Leon's one liners is what helped make him so endearing.
vaaamoooooooooooooooo lo pibe
on my 30th Birthday?
no way it's actually happening
I got hyped with red9
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💥💥💥💥💥🤧😲
En mi cumpleaños sale 🥺🥺😭
Pls don't be an hour game of disappointment like re3make
alv que buena estaba la ashely la bufearon :3
Part of me was wanting them to show the Bingo part. Best Leon line of all time.
ta raro
Cant wait for Leon heeeeelp?
Why are the best PS5 games... PS3 and PS2 games?? lol
I have waited my whole life for this, ever since I played this game as a kid.
Eventually, they’re gonna come full circle and make improved versions of Biohazard and Village.
Y yo que no me quería fapear hoy
will it be exclusive to ps5?
No puedo describir mi felicidad
Game can't top the original
I wanna resident evil code verónica remake not resident evil 4 remake :(  😑
Is it just going to be on the ps5?
YES!!
El Leon is back
What a time to be alive!
Trinston was here  .
That's amazing and all but here's the next gen updates for 2 and 3
man, I’ve been waiting for this for what feels like forever. still quite a wait ahead but excited to have a date.
Já conferiram se o Dave Jones tá vivo depois dessa confirmação?
Will this be on the ps4?
Un forastero
When's RE2 and RE3 PS5 VERSIONS COMING OUT ?
Even today I still feel the terror when the regenerating monsters slowly approach, I'm thrilled to play it again!
Tengo fe en que no recortarán partes del juego, dale Capcom 🙏🥺
I don’t understand. I thought Leon was supposed to be Mexican?
Maybe this  resident evil 4 Is gonna to be connected to resident evil village
Con eso hasta un hombre adulto puede llorar :")
Meuuu amiiiigoooooo
Original RE4 still holds up to this day. I didn't thought they would remake it
Lindo demais
Leon Death Sound HD I.5 ReMIX
I hope this game comes out for X Box
No saldrá para ps4? 😢
Remastered regenerators and iron maidens?! Bring em’ on!!!
LEON  HELP!
YESSSSSS
Code Veronica maybe? Next? Eh? :u
Yesssss
IS this only PS5 exclusive?
this game represent my childhood and it's very special to me, Capcom Dont mess up with this game like RE3
I figured it wouldn’t be on ps4. But village started out by teasing to only be on ps5, I kinda hope this one does the same!
Ahh. Have you ever been happy to be alive? I will definitely play this game. Of course I enjoyed the original and I also enjoyed the remake. Thank you Capcom
I'm looking forward to seeing how they butchered this classic game. Totally unnecessary remake. Should have remade code veronica instead.
LETS GOOOO
Will it be released for PS4?
impossivel
Noooo, we have to wait so long 💔😣
Let down
This is life
🙏🏾🔥🔥 best resident evil game I’ve ever played
These days I completely forgot about the las plagas existence, we haven’t seen those things since RE damnation (2012).
UN FORASTERO!
Espero no le quiten la faldita a Ashley para verla en 4k 😏
wissh mantaap GAME LEGEND DI REMAke
Maaaan 24.3.2023 🫠
looks dope!! , can't wait to play Resident Evil again
Te amo Capcom, la reputamdre
This is what am waiting for
"Un forastero" returns
I CALLED IT!!!
RE4, RE Village PSVR2 and The Callisto Protocol were the only super hype announcements for me.
that would be great if they add old RE4 3D model for costume option. just imagine old character model but new environment that would be awesome feeling
My favourite game of all time, I hope it’s like the original
ada looks like she is wearing her RE6 getup lol
We've been feasting like kings in the RE household, lets go!!!
Jueputaaaaaaa Al fin el juego de mi infancia remasterizado
واخيرا 😂😂😂😂❤️❤️😂ننتضر لل 23  شبيدنة مبين ريميك اسطوري
ME: SO GUYS "WHAT'RE YA BUYIN?"  EVERYONE: "AH! I'LL BUY IT AT A HIGH PRICE!"
Resident evil 4,  The Calisto Protocol e Street fighter 6,  AMÉM.
A voz antiga do Lord Sadler era muito melhor e tinha um tom de deboche, agora parece uma voz de nerd punheteiro.
the day has come guy
Couple of things I want. More time with Luis so his death feels more impactful. And more time around the village, because going to the castle really sucked me out of it in the original.
FINALLYYYYYYYYYYYYY
LETSSSSS GOOOOOO
Esperamos tanto por esse momento
L'ayant encore finie il y a quelques mois sur la Wii je suis impatient de voir le résultat sur cet version remasterisé. Ne faite pas nimp Capcom svp et laissez la mitraillette infini et bazooka infini une fois le jeu fini a 500 000 pesos . Hehehe welcom to hère stranger .
" Detrás de ti imbécil " XD
Can’t wait to see gameplay.
can already tell we're going to be disappointed when we actually get it. Hopefully they learned from RE3 Nemesis
Leon: Oh no, here we go again... Ashley: Leon? Luis: kinda rough don't ya think?
Resident evil 4 fez parte da vida de todo gamer do Brasil. PS2 <3
IT HAS BEGAN!!!!!
now ashley can reduce my will to life in 4k
Visions of “What’d ya buying?”
Alright! Cannot wait till they eventually remake 5, 6, and 7!
Im waiting for Salazar's "Mr Kenneddy""
Hopefully they keep the one-liners intact. It could provide a fun juxtaposition with the renewed focus on horror.
por un momento suena la musica original
OH NO WE GOT TOO COCKY CODE VERONICA BROS
LEEEEOOOOON!!!!
NO LO PUEDO CREER AL FIN UNA RAZON PARA LLEGAR VIVO AL 2023
Ps5 only ?
It’s probably going to be like 1 hour and 50 min long
La inutil que nunca se deja salvar.
Al parecer el remake de Resident Evil 4 es practicamente un hecho, me hubiese gustado mejor el remake de Code: Veronica o el Outbreak File#3, eso si que tienen potencial.
Please just make literally the same again but with better graphics and gameplay please don’t RE3re it
IT'S HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!
Can't wait to suplex Ganados all over again!
Dont get too excited these modern companies butcher every game they make.
"Excuse me, Sir?"
and remember guys this is just announcement trailer, we gonna see more soon
me dejo sin palabras...la intro esta de la ptm. Revivio los mejores momentos que tuve al tocar una ps2 por primera vez , con esos gráficos realmente hacen que le vuele a uno la cabeza...
I'll get the game I just don't think an re4 remake is really necessary.
It better have coop
leeeeeoooooon but now in 4k
Now we can kill Ashley in 4K with Unreal Engine!
YOOOOOOOOOOOO \
Wish it was for ps4 tho that's mostly my problem...
I wanna see The Merchant saying Welcome Stranger again
Dunno thinking RE 4 will look like a downgrade of 8. Rather had 1 redone like 2 and 3.
the graphics look the same as the original
It will be different  than original   but I don't  care 🤷  im happy  to play  it again 🤩🤩🤩 can't wait 😪
Like
Que não seja igual o Resident Evil 3 remake
2022 acabou de ser salvo <3
YOOOO
Best thing in the live stream ! I literally got heart attack
Leon HELPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
i dont know what the price Will be but i will buy it Nooooo matter whaaat!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hate english people for writing dates wrong
I've been waiting so long love this
LEOOOOONN HEEEEEEEEEEELPP!!!!!!!
FINALLY ; w ;
Right before the countdown,  my last thought was there’s is no way Capcom is going to  reveal RE4, when I saw The “R” and then the Theme, i just never felt so much excitement for a Game and if I had its been a while.
siiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Why? Resident Evil 4 still holds up.. A Code Veronica remake would be understandable as that game has not aged as well. Why can't Capcom do something for the fans for once, an Outbreak 1 & 2 HD remaster with online support.
SHAKING CRYING SOBBING BAWLING THROWING UP I’M SO SO EXCITED
It better keep Leon’s cheesiness
If they remake resident evil 5, do you think they're gonna keep in Christ punching the boulder?
I just hope they kept the same horror feeling from the original RE4 because that game already a masterpiece of it's own
morir es vivir, morir es vivir
Re4 is easily one of my favorite games, but they knocked it out of the park with Re2 remake, and this looks quite promising.
So, this isn't going to be on PS4? I was just making sure
Mano tá muito incrível, eu acho que eles fizeram uma cena em live action, a cena que o presidente pega no Leon. Parece muito o ator do Trailer de Revelação do Resident Evil 2 Remake. Por conta da remodelada nas roupas da Jill e da Claire, pensei que fossem fazer a Ashley usar calça também.
It's graphics look really great
It's here, finally!!
Gracias por este increible juego , siempre supe que en algun momento tendrian que sacarlo y por fin lo han hecho , ahora solo esperar hasta que salga , muchas gracias son los mejores  :3
フルゲームpsvr2 で遊びたいです!イーサンもよかったからレオンやエイダになりたい
Nintendo: Mario Sega: Sonic Xbox: Halo Playstation: Resident Evil
wait only ps5? noooooooo!!!
"Detras de ti imbecil"
I can't believe it. I can't believe it in my own eyes. BUT IF THEY CAN REMAKE THAT thin what about king kong peter jackson what about that game 🎮 😔😔😔😔😔😔😔
I remember how skilled Capcom was in porting powerful CPS and CPS2 games to 16 and 32 bit consoles. Now. It's PS5  That's all...   And of course the latest XBOX and PC anytime soon, but you got my point here, I hope.
At this rate we'll be getting a remake of RE Village before 2030.
can't wait for this resident evil game and I can't wait to see ADA WONG
Re2 remake is probably my favourite game and I love the original re4  = gimme now
Definitely gonna have it.
AGGHHH
I screamed when I saw this, I thought I had to wait more time for this game.
I really should play Resi 2 & 3 Remake now that this is coming out.
Playable in VR2??
Ill buy it at a high price!
creo que algo se movio en mis pantalones
im sure this version will cut alot of stuff from the island part but i hope they will atleast keep the regenerados and the mike bit
Ok, I was worried that the whole game would be dark blue, but there is yellow brown, or something other than dark blue.  All right, time to be an forastero.
É o residenti ivo 4 remake muleke - Jones Davy
I’m very psyched for this. Let us hope it turns out as awesome as the re2 remake.
ps4?
I really hope they would add more boss fights than the original  That would make it a truly new experience
I honestly dread going back and fighting the enemies in this game especially the chainsaw dude, the catfish and that one creature was a body guard for Salazar
UGH I cant wait
Ohhh 🤩🤩🔥🔥❤️
Awe I love Paul Mercer and his voice always sounds amazing when he voice Leon as his cocky self. But I’m excited for this!!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Выглядит круто
amazing 🔥
Im so happy Im so hyped When i can give the money for this game
Oh lord. I’m so excited
Remaking this instead of Code Veronica is such an astronomically stupid move. Not ragging on anyone who wants this, I just wish I felt the hype you guys do. Maybe I am just too old.
Increíble
Kinda disappointed we didn't get a 'Leeeon!' When we saw a glimpse of Ashley, but I'll deal
I hope they don't F it up like RE2 remake
After this please do Code Veronica 😭 it should’ve been done before this 😭
yeah right only for PS5 just like the original was only for the Gamecube ...that didnt age well did it ?
Will it be available to play on ps4?
so  no code verinoca remake
🤯🤯🤯
Só compro se tiver aquele cachorro que você salva no começo do jogo. Depois ele aparece pra te ajudar contra o bichão grande lá. Adoro aquele cãozinho 🐶
Que coisa lindaaaaaa
Não vi o Mercador... :(
I got so scared , I thought the N meant it was a Netflix show
If "Whatcha Buyin'?" Guy isn't in this, I don't want it. Hahaha
Yay! Cant wait! Please Capcom do Onimusha next!!!
The game that basically exists in every platform since it’s release, is being remastered I’m guessing so it can be released on every platform for the next 20 years again
Разрабы , подарите мне эту игру. У меня в этот день ,День Рождение :)
Meu medo é saber o que a Capcom cortou do original kkkkkkk kkkkkkk.
MArch 24 . My birthday 🎂. Happier AF .
😱
LEON HELP!!
esta va a ser la mejor joya
MFW FAZ UMA SERIE DISSO EU IMPLORO
If they cut content i will never forgive it.
Hope it's not like the awful RE3 remake as that was quite possibly the worst remake of any game I've ever played.
Eu vivi pra ver isso nem acredito ♥️
Huh, I thought they would remake code Veronica next. Can't say I'm mad since I liked 4 wayyy better, I'm just kind of surprised.
I'll be sure to spend $60-70 on this...
WoW I play resident evil 4 on every console can wait to do it again on ultra super mega hd remaster I finally found a reason for me to get a ps5
Hopefully Capcom keep away from censorship & stay loyal as possible to the original as possible.
i’m trying not to freak out but on the inside i scream 🕺🕺
im a bit worried, leon doesnt sound as hardened as he did in RE4...... pleasedontbebadpleasedontbebadpleasedontbebadpleasedontbebad
Cant't wait to see "Help Me Leon!"
hoping itll come out on ps4 as well, doesn't look any more system pushing then village so i don't see why it wouldn't
Y'ALL NOTICE VITORES MÉNDEZ WILL BE CHASING US ALL OVER "El pueblo" RIGHT?  NO FUKK$ING WAYYYY BRO. I'M, ¡HAPPY!
sem palavras
Resident Evil 4 does not need a remake but okay… how about Re5 next? Then 6? 7? 8?
Brabo demais e infelizmente não poderei jogar pois não tenho ps5 e quem dera PC kkkkkkkkkkkk
ONLY ON PLAYSTATION 5 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
I am excited for this one
Finally we get the RE4 that gave us the most badass version of LSKennedy. In fact, this game defined a new genre of action-adventure-survival horror that sorely lacks appreciation today.   If you haven't played the game cube version... please do before this remake comes out . Awesome
Eso tilin
the darker and more gloomy environment than the original is one of the things i was expecting to see!
o leon ta parecendo uma kombi, tamanho do cara
Es Remake o Remaster ???
PS5 only or pc too?
Ahhh! I will BUY with HIGH PRICE ,STRANGER!
Only buy if you have that dog that is saved at the beginning of the game. Then he appears to help you against the big beast there. I love that puppy 🐶
I see Resident Evil Village assets and looks. I knew Village was a "preface" for this game.
Wow can't wait to have to deal with Ashley again now in HD!
I just hope they kept the merchant!! It would be cool if he made a reference to the merchant from 7
W
Guys remember, keep your expectations low, and you'll never be disappointed.
NECESITOOOO!!!
Better have the bingo joke.
Ahora falta el 5 y 6 jajaja
Holly sh*t I'm so happy my .. the best RE of all time is back
If there's a change on Ashley they HAVE TO do, is making her a mule; if she's not going to fight (and I hope the devs DO NOT include combat for Ashley) at least she can carry ammo and items. Also, more sections with her just running away would be great
So no for ps4 well rip. I am poor to buy a ps5
Non ci credooooo
Grito loca de Flanders Activado
As much as I wanted a Code Veronica Remake more I’m still hyped for this lol
I've played three versions of this game and I am still excited for this one.
Will be in pc?
My body is ready
YESSSS
es mame vrdad
espero q seja melhor q o remake do 3
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Re4 was a huge part of my childhood. I am beyond excited for this!
Real question is if Ashley is still has her ballistic system.
Morir es vivi, morir es vivir
Looks awesome, but why is Leon still so young? Idk if Paul Mercier is still in the business, but at least bring back Matthew Mercer...
Eu espero por esse momento a anos!!!!!!
What about the Village DLC tho? I mean, it would make sense to bring it out before RE4 😅
Been waiting for this day ever since I was a kid
The game looks amazing! I love Ashley's new outfit. Hopefully Capcom learned their lesson after the RE3 disappointment, if mostly everything faithfully carries over to the new version and they give us a handful of extra/alternative surprises, this will be one of the best horror games ever made. And here's hoping this is a third person game or has the option to toggle perspectives. I feel much more immersed in a horror experience when I can see the character I'm controlling on screen instead of pretending it's "me".
They gave Luis Serra a French accent?
what are you buying
El remake que no necesitábamos y que nadie pidió
Thought it was Zorro 😅
🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️Manifestando poder jugarlo al estreno 🕯 🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️
Is this going be done with fixed camera angles? Or is it still going to be a third person game?
NÃO ESTRAGA O MEU RESIDENT EVIL FAVORITO CAPCOM!
My childhood <3
I got my game 😍🥰
Is this ps5 only?
En la parte de abajo se ve medio pixelado y arriba españita!!
Haters gonna hate but I'm amped for this!!! Been waiting forever and hopefully they deliver, they know they can't mess this one up. RE4 are huge shoes to fill and no matter what can't please everyone but I'll wait until I play it to make final judgments.
Im here for Wong
CODE VERONICA REMAKE NEXT
Ada got redesigned. Sad.
¿remasterizado o con mejores gráficos y doblaje?
Help me Leon! LEON!
Code Veronica next please. That game absolutely needs a remake.
Oh booo. Just make a new game, you lazy twerps.
The thing with this remake is that RE4 itself is STILL a modern game and holds up fine. And also remember how BIG this game really was. It was like 2-3 times bigger than your standard Resident Evil game, you really think they aren't gonna cut content?
Sem dúvidas o game do ano tem que ser..😍
Thats dope
Damn.....I love the voice actor for Leon in the past. Hard to see Leon without the sarcasm and charm from the Original. OG FOR LIFE!!!!! (And heres to hope that this one is close to being the original with more badass tech advancements!)  *"Where's everyone going, Bingo!?*
i bet you 100 bucks they nerfed Ashley's ballistics.
MDSSSS, AGORA SIM O NEGÓCIO TÁ SINISTRO
This is gonna be great!
YESSSS
I have one important thing to ask… *Do you have a smoke?*
When I saw and heard Luis's silhouette and voice, I was literally shaking in joy lol. The nostalgia I had after playing RE4 years ago appeared again.
Weeelcomeee R4
These graphics are atrocious
Como sea igual que resident evil 3 remake...
Realiza meu sonho de ter um Playstation Sony por favor
I have bad feeling
Being a ps5 owner just keeps getting better and better
better bring back the mercenaries mode
Hype!!! I am so excited about this
RE4 is one of fav games of all time, I knew it so well could play through the whole thing in a few hours when I was a kid, hyped to do the same with this
AND WITH THE SAME VA AS 2 REMAKE LET'S GOOOOO
I knew it.
YES. This just made my day.
Ребята, это шедевр. Ждите обзор от Бобрика
I’m wet.
i'm down but why can't developers make something NEW that holds a candle to this
I was happy enough to learn this until I read it's only PS5 dammit 😭. Guess I'm stuck with the OG
Acabo de volverme loco
Ah man the memories
1:28 Ada lookin such a hottie!
Resident Evil 4, the greatest Resident Evil game if you didn't grow up with the franchise. The Five Nights At Freddy's equivalent of scratching that itch. I'm hoping it's less action packed, I doubt it.
I was honestly hoping all the original cast would come back but guess we'll see how this new cast does
The game will get delayed. Calling it now.
Not feeling it.  CVX deserved a remake.  Leons model looks off in his jacket. As if he was short and chubby and the way he walks feels wrong as well.
El remake más esperado de los últimos años, lo jugué en Gamecube, PS2, Wii, PS4, Switch y por supuesto que lo jugaré en PS5. ¡Un forastero! ¡A por él!
HUGE!!!!
I don't believe it porfin porfin:) I'll pay anything for RL
Aeeeeeeeeeeeeee meu jogo preferido 😎🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
каеф
after reliving RE4 in VR, which was very fun despite the cut lines, pricetag, quest2 exclusive and lack of Separate ways and Assignment Ada, very curious to know how they're gonna do this one.
can't wait to see Mike again
I hope this Will be a 3rd person game
The one thing I hope is that the game is longer THAN the original or, at as the original at the least. Man I'm too super stoked about this! I can't believe it's actually coming!
Epicoo
my goal , is to stay alive till 3.24.2023 now , hope I dont get rolled on by a truck !
can't wait for someone to yell at me how they're "going to break me to pieces" in spanish and 4k
Bro these graphics looking spooky RE2 looked better than this
Ill be honest, i dont really care for this......
Hopefully they don’t cut stuff out like they did with RE3
ok where's re8 dlc at
Is it a remake or a remaster???
This is awesome
Why?. Just why
i hope the games also comes on pc
AEEEEEEEE P9HAAAAAA RE4 REMAKE
Whats the point of remaking a near perfect game?
Como no dejen la línea de "MORIR ES VIVIR" denuncio
Am i seeing right, is that claire?
Yes yes yes yes yes
Sad that they didn't get the original voice actors from the original game, but let's hope the comedy/horror is as legendary because that is one part I love to see come back
No chance this will surpass the original masterpiece but it can still be decent enough if they didn’t cut any content. I want the full village, castle and island, mercenaries, all weapons, bottle caps, Assignment Ada and Seperate Ways. If anything there should be more content, not less.
WHERE IS HE, WHERE IS THE MERCHANT
And I want resident evil online
Lo único que espero en esta nueva versión es que Leon no tenga cara de emo tiktoker (RE 2 REMAKE).
LEON!!! HELP!!!
Thank you Capcom.
Resident Evil 4!!! FINALLY!!! 🙌
YEEEEES!!!!! YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!!!!!!!!
🥹
الحماس مليون 😥🔥
I have dreamed of this day...and it's finally here!
Simply.. Yes please! So looking forward to this
Hoping it's more like RE2 Remake than the RE3 Remake, the latter was pretty much a completely different game with millions of things missing from the original
YESSSSSS
Sucesso, Leon Fodao e Bonitao... ^^,
1:57 Ashley ta gatinha hmmmmmmmmmm
Hype altíssimo pra esse game,
Nice
.
It’s going to be so weird playing a version of Resident Evil 4 that (seemingly) takes itself seriously.
Put@ play station network RATA!!!!!!! Pinche servicio de  atención al cliente esta de la verg@.
only thing that would've made the teller even better is if at the very end you heard the sound of a chainsaw revving up
Yo capcom, please don’t cut half the game
Bro every model looks so crisp Capcom going stupid with the graphics (as always but they jus flexing atp)
Deixando minha marca para o melhor Resident Evil
The best game in the series is getting a remake that might improve it even more, how is that possible?
Mr chinsaw is back in town
<3
Resident Evil 4 is honestly one of the greatest survival horror experience ever. Can't wait to face enemies like the regenerator,  U3, Del Lago and El Gigante as my experience with the original is fueling my excitement for this remake! (Please do not fail)
PS4?
MATALO
Its only just for ps5?
PLEASE CAPCOM, DO NOT CUT CONTENT.
YAAHHHHHHHHH
Plz add this on ps4 🥲
Can't wait to see a Regenerator
Poxa só ps5
Ps5 only? Figures 😢 looks great though
I really hope they nail this. Resident Evil 4 has been my favorite game since I was little and this trailer does give me hope. Keep up the great work Capcom!!!!!!
Ps4 ?
Hehehe, thank you!
Leonnnnn hellllllllp
thanks... bro.
Finally..... A trailer
YAAAAS LET'S GO BABY
Resident Evil 4 Remake 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Come back anytime 😩😩
I just want that they perfectly adapt the original creepy atmosphere and modernize it, basically just like they did in re2  Also with no cut content this time, don't want the whole island section to be cut out
🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🇧🇷
What!!!!!?
Is it for playstation 5 only or xbox too?
Heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy agaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
My childhood has been revitalized
Yeahh! Another not new and repetitive experience...yeah
What’s the point of a RE4 remake? Y’all might as well give us a resident evil 5 remake after this lol
My fav resident evil ever.
please, dont be like re3 remake
Will come to pc right?
Just wondering how regenerators will look like!!
Gonna put some dirt in Krauser's eye in 4k .
Animada demais. Meu Deus 💙💙💙💙
The priests saying "MOBIADIDOU" gives me already nightmare !!!
Only on ps5 ?
So excited can’t wait 🤍🖤🤎
So glad I didn't get it on Quest 2
Yes they're going deeper on the horror elements for the remake!!!
Infelizmente fico um pouco triste por O jogo não sair pra ps4 é xboxone
UN FORASTERO!
That’s it? 😂
I’m literally crying from happiness haha
It wont be the same if there isn't the guy that says 'RESIDENT EVIL FOURRRRR'
Que coisa linda.
Oh boy. 2020 I played the original and now I shall play the remake.
So long as lady dimitrescu appears out of no where I will be mega happy.
So excited for this!  Played the original when I was younger on the gamecube wanted this remade for such a long time!
The game that didn’t need a remake.

i wanna cry
2023 😭 so far away
AHORA SISI QUIERO MATAR!!!!!!  PUEDES CORRER PERO NO PUEDES DISCUTIR :v
Thats all I need to see GoTY of 2023 calling it now…unless FFVII Remake pt. 2 comes out as well 😂.
why not for PS4? 😭
I still say its too soon for this remake but since were already here I hope they let ada keep her red dress 💃
Slk pena q não tenho ps5
Please say its also for PS4 as well?
Let’s goooooooooOoOoOooOOooOoOoOoOoOoOo
Looks like I’m about to have to upgrade platforms
Can’t wait for my ears to bleed from Ashley’s weapon
I love the original so much I can't help but be cautious of remake. How does one improve on perfection?
Bro , we need a time machine already i can't wait this masterpiece for more long !!!!!!!!!
Dona CAPCOM lance essa obra de arte para o PS4 tbm☹️😍
Эшли красотка
One game i never wanted a remake of. But this looks pretty exciting. Hope it lives up to the hype.
This is awesome! Can't wait to play
I love that they are making all these Resident Evil remakes, but could you PLEASE make a Dino Crisis remake Capcom?!?  I can’t be the only one that’s wants to see that game remade!
Ovo chora de emoçaum mds o DAVA JONES estava CERTO KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Hopefully it isn't shortened like the re3 remake
I grew up playing this game, I'm so looking forward to this. Hope they don't cut out as much like they did in RE3 remake
Can't wait to see the merchant. Weeelcooomeee strangeeer 😎
Ps5 only? O will it be available for pc also?
This is 10,000x cooler than the SF6 trailer. Whoever is doing the RE presentation and development is knocking it out of the park.
It’s time to bring out my RE instinct
bin soooo hyped
and xbox series resident evil remake 4
LEOOOOOOOOON HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELP! 🤮🤮🤮
Current gen only. Oh yes!
Not everyone has PS5. It's going to be a shot in the foot to launch ONLY for PS5
No for ps4?😢
hopefully the gameplay length isnt edited down by a wide margin
Only on playstation 5?
,💪💪💪💪
Let’s go!!
i just hope they keep all the boss from the original game .  man duel with krauser was one of the best and greatest fight in RE
Just hope Ashley is less whiney in the remake
And Code Verónica :(?
Yaaaasssss
Why is leon not as cool looking as the original?
Please don't make this a Playstation Exclusive!
I never liked RE4 (talking about the original, my fav is RE3 followed by 2), but let`s see if this remake could change my mind
Dude this looks and sounds fantastic. I’m royally hyped
I hope this time Ashley has better AI
Hypeeeeedddd 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Does anyone else thing Ashley looks like the Sphere Hunter
Waifu Ashley
can't wait for the hospital part in HD 💀
What is this uneasy feeling
YASSSS!!!
viva cristo rey
So hype
This is peak gaming right here
"Where's everyone going ? Bingo ? " This quote has to stay !!!
Finally  Can't wait
I really didn’t think they gonna reveal it on state of play! Really excited for it!
If the rumors about this game are true, this will be the largest RE game ever, and I'm hella excited
Too bad if Genshin Impact made 2 billions from retarded people. This game will make pennies from people loving the game !
Already getting bad vibes from it. Gonna play it because 4 always deserves a chance with me, but I can already see myself starting up the original as the next game I play afterward. Remind myself I still have it and don't need whatever mess this will likely turn into.
Ps4 💔💔😔
9 friggin months...ahhhhhh.....GoW Ragnarok needs to Happen ASAP
My best game of all time
Even though Capcom did state that RE8 took inspiration from RE4, it feels like the other way around with the remake
Ihuuu
So it's resident evil 4 remake? Nice.
So is this gonna be a ps5 exclusive?
if i don’t hear “LEOOONNNNN HELPPPP” or if the merchant doesn’t say  “what’re ya buyin’?”  “what’re ya sellin’?”  “i’ll buy that a high price”  “Ah, the choice of an avid gun collector! It's a nice gun, mate!”  i’m going to be highly disappointed.
I heard the spanish music and saw the "R" and was like: "there's no way..."      Well turns out there is a way because Capcom did it and i am officially losing my mind!
Resident evil 4 remake AND RE8 In VR??!!
Esqueceram do PS4? ,😔
I really hope the game is as long as the original. I'm so excited to see the new models and updated gameplay.
THANKS SONY!!!!!!
ONGOMG
un forastero
Espero que chegue logo tenho re4 no ps4 mas um remate seria bem melhor
Lindo
Will it be available on the ps4?
🤩🤩🤩
So bad Dino Crisis remake  >  Re4 remake
Please don't take out the cheesy one liners and make the game super serious.
I AM SO EXCITED!!
Im sorry but i think Leon looks way too young
insane
Hmmmmmmmmmmm well if this disappoints, it’s not like there isn’t 500 versions of OG resi 4 to choose from
should've ported gohst of tsushima to pc
The atmosphere looks a bit off, way too much morning vibes
This looks 100% better than the original one ❤️💪 can’t wait
Please dont do this game like RE3 remake
Nossa vai c top em remake do re4 era q mais queria da saga
My best childhood game ☺️🌹🌹🌹
Ó o Resident evil 4 remake mlk 😱😱😱😱😨😨😨😨😲😲😲
i know you wont disspoint us capcom
este juego saldrá solo para ps5?
i thought was Resident Evil  Code: Veronica remake that would be nice!!!!!!
And PS4 please!!🙏🙏
I desperately hope that they're making it more horror focused. The og 4 is pretty much just a great horror themed 3rd person shooter.
I this doesn't get like RE3 "remake"
"No thanks, Bro!"  I'd rather have a Code Veronica remake.
Ps5 exclusive?
😍😍😍😍
half of this trailer is a black screen.
Please for ps4 please
THAT WILL RELEASE ON MY BIRTHDAY...........++---------$-#&@&&#&$&&# HELP
So dissapointed if leon face same like re 2
Yes!!!!!! Let's gooo
Leon movements at the end are pretty similar to the cancelled Re 3.5 Mansion, i hope this one leans more on horror than the original can't wait!
Ah the game that didnt need a remake at all.
AWOOGA HUNMIINAH HUMINA SLURROPRPPP
Spanish villagers with an actual spanish accent, let's go.
"Morir Es Vivir!"
Looks amazing and RE4 was probably my favorite RE game so definitely hyped..
What are you buying? on march 24
quiero ver jugar al Fedelobo esta joyita 😍
MY DREAMS HAVE FINALLY COME TRUEEEE
is this exclusive to PlayStation?
Color me impressed. I'm hoping this delivers and then some compared to RE3. CapGods once again
Yeah, this looks like it’s gunna be the most game ever
His clothes look way too big for him. It doesn’t look right to me for some reason
No PS4 version?
Aí sim ansioso para jogar meu resident favorito no ps5
im LGBT!!!!
Ps4???
leoncio quenedi tá de volta, 🙌🙌🙌
Solo espero que esta vez sean las voces en español de verdad 🤣🤣🤣
Please stay true to the original unlike RE3 remake.
Cogedlo!
welp, time to put serious effort in getting a PS5
:0
Looks Great. Had it on the PS2 then the GameCube. The controls on the GameCube were better for me, but I really want to play this.
Its funny because after years of not playing RE4, I finally decide to start playing it again and what happens? RE4 REMAKE IS FINALLY ANNOUNCED
I only expect the Ganados speak properly Spanish from Spain instead the mexican Spanish mixed with gibberish from the original RE4
i sure do hope they remake 5 if you're doing this one too lol  i want RE5 remake
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Let's go can't wait to play this game ✌️
Re 4 remake same graphic like re 8
More Butcha-U content? Yes, please
SIIIIIIIUUUUUUUUUU 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Mesmo já esperando que um dia iria vir, VEIO MESMO AAAAAAAAAAA
Welcome to Spain
a ver si ashley se redime y no es tan castrosa en este remake
Deixem a história exatamente como o primeiro! Por favor!
WOOOOOOOOW
.....tacos de picadillo.... mmmm
IT’S FINALLY CONFIRMED!!
Me compraría la PS5 solo por este juego,  me muero que juegaso
plz say the " Resident evil... 4! With the voice
I have a excuse to buy PS5 😂😂🤣
por favor diganme que no estara ashley :c
RE4 REMAKE?2!/!3-
If Leon doesn't say "Bingo" I'm not interested
I went into the re2 remake hyped as f*ck and got so disappointed with it that i miraculously enjoyed re3 remake because my expectations were unreasonably low.  Im not holding my breath for this one, i cant afford a ps5 anyway 🤣
It’ll be ruined I don’t trust Sony and capcom anymore
Amazing
Wooooo yes!
Literally just watched Max’s playthrough from 3 years ago where he was talking about this as an instant money button. What are the odds
QUE NÃO TIREM O KRAUSER COMP ALGUNS RUMORES APONTARAM
ADA!!!!! 1:28
Increible!
horror now😝😝😜😜😜😜😜😜😜😜😜😜
Que jogo incrível. Coincidentemente, estava jogando ele hoje.
PLEASE DON'T BE LIKE THE RE3 REMAKE
2/10 not morbius
If they wont put it on ps4 they will f..ck up everything!!
We are going to see the castle in a cinematic and that will be it
Imagine how terrifying the Regenerators are gonna be, assuming they're not cut out or replaced with something else. I also hope "Big Cheese" stalks you like Mr X from RE2 remake.
Finally, the game we all want
The Game that got me into Video Games !
Nice nostalgia
Only PlayStation 5??? What about PlayStation 4
let’s goooooo
After a decade of waiting, it's finally happening
I think that this should have definitely been the final announcement of the stream.
MORIR ES VIVIRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AGUANTE CAPCOM!!
LETS GO
LETS GOOOOO THE MASTERPIECE IS FINALLY BEING REMADE
Looks great capcom but it CANNOT be 3 hours long again.  RE2 and RE3 were very short games that still had a lot of content cut...RE4 is like a 20 hour game.  The remake needs to be at least half that long.
You gonna play as Ashley at the beginning btw
Un forasteiro!!!!!
I'm skeptical about this. Hopefully we get gameplay soon, and they don't remove a bunch of stuff from the game like they did 3. I also hope they add some new content. This is an easy game of the year if they pull it off.
They nerfed Ashley's goofy ears.
Yes! They bring back Leon's jacket
3rd person or fps view ?
Where's Code Veronica
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They better not butcher this.
I wonder how much is Capcom going to censor this game
UFFFFFFFFFFFFF listo, precompradisimo
Ansiosaaaaa!!!!
LETSSS GOOO
YES YES YES YES YES!
Best remake ever
LETS GOOOO
LEON! HELP!
daymnnnn i hope it's the same or even better than the original one
It’s magnificent
they are going to butcher the merchant for DLC i am SO sure of that
El mejor resident evil de todos quieran o no :)
Saddler, _you're_ small time.
MAAAAN , to sem reação desse trailer ate agora , só pra quem é fã da franquia vai entender o que estou sentindo nesse momento , sem palavras para essa excelentíssima obra de arte. " Capcom " nunca duvide !! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
how can you enhance THE RE4?....stranger
this is also one of the better state of play's playstation had.
Wow❤️😘
W
Only on ps5 , time to cry
LEONNNMMM
His personality and charm: gone.
Why isn’t it Resident Evil 4 (( REMAKE )) ??
6 months till 2023, then 3 months for march. It's feels so near yet so far away 😂. Can't wait to see it played by my favorite gaming YouTubers
😍😍😍😍😍😍
This gives Capcom a chance to make the game more like survival horror. I’m so excited!
Ashley : Leon!! help!! Leon : here we go again
YES for god’s sake
The best RE EVER!! Olé 💃🏻
Wearing everybody go........ Bingo.
Here we go again I think...
Interested but worried, cuz how can you top perfection. Also where's code veronica x remake?
I’m so hyped
They made ashley cuter
1 questions.  Can I look underneath 😆
The best of state of play
I still can`t believe it. Love RE Games, and this one is a must for a remake.
Capcom has been steadily killing it these past few years, and I couldn’t be happier. It really reminds me of my childhood!
Dont rush this like RE3 Remake
My body is ready
This looks amazing
5/10 le falto el "puedes correr, pero no te puedes escundir"
Perfeição
as long as they don't pull a re3 (2020) on us
🙀
Graphics seem worse then the other remakes but im still hype
Who else remembers growing up with this game on ps2?
Hopefully this games the same love as RE2R
Great. Hopefully we will be able to easily buy a PS5 by 2023
UUUUUUUUUUUUFFFFFFFFFFFF
There are about to be a lot of curious people looking at Ashley a certain way in this remake.
This is going to be next gen only. The leon walk at the end looks beautiful. I'm hyped
Zzz
Finally!!
😊
Looks great, hope to see online mercenaries
Capcom, don't RE Remake 3 this one.
Resident Evil 4 Remake is back?! Like the remade of the original of Resident Evil 4 2005? Okay. But I’m a fan of remake video games of Resident Evil so was Mafia 1 too
Unexpected news but exciting news. Definitely looking forward to adding this to my gaming library.
I’m gonna buy a ps5 just for this game 🤩🤩🤩🤩
I'm sooo happy😭😭😭
Eu amo esse game fez parte da minha vida e ver isso é de grande gratificação, mas não vou comprar um PlayStation 5 só pra jogar ele, poderia ter pra outras plataformas
Subject: Resident Evil 4 Remake Intro: Juandissimo and Moto Moto are flirting with you with a rose in the mouth
Revivio el gaming señores!
We got a Teaser and a Release Date!! 🥳
My life is complete
Re4 didn’t need a remake yet. I really wish they’d do something with Code Veronica. It’s so under appreciated…
too bad so many of us wont be able to play it since we dont have ps5s
King of Resident Evil games 👑
Cara me assustei pq quando o lettering foi fechando achei que era o N da Netflix, já até pensei que fosse alguma bomba
I’m sure most people is like, “Please! Don’t make Ashley Graham as insufferable as she was in the original!”
I hope that the spanish finally talk like spanish peaple and not mexicans
It's been a while last time I was hyped like this for a game, this is gonna be amazing!
Why not on ps4
if there isn’t “LEOONN HELLLPP” then there’s no like
REmake 2 was a great improvement over RE2. REmake 3 was a major disappointment compared to RE3. RE4 is kinda perfect as is, I dunno how they could even do it justice as a direct copy, much less a remake.
If only we could have Paul Mercier back as Leon tho’
dope
This remake has way more horror vibe than the original!!
sempre assim, trailer legal, chega na hora ....  quero ver o que retiraram do jogo
this was the best thing about the state of play
I hope it doesn't get censored like the RE4 VR game.
Ashley Lion look so fkng Gorgeos 🥺
*Excited screaming*
I really hope they get the Mexicans right.
The original has aged super well so I really hope this goes for something different.
o jogo tá lindo, mas pena q não vou jogar tão cedo...
genial tendre q cambiar de consola obligado xd
El juego saldra para la ps4?
UN FORASTERO!!!!
¡¡¡Un forastero!!!
finally it was done to all the fans I am super happy
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
RE4 Remake & SF6? MAX is gonna lose his mind 🤣
HELP ME LEON!! 🤣
Big W
uhuuu remakezin
So excited for re4
Shut up and take my money!
Eu tô surtando porraaaa mdsss 😂
I recently played through this on VR and it was incredible, I hope they update the controls for this remake because that was the reason I couldn't get into the old console version.
Why does this need to exist?
Não estraguem o sonho como foi RE3 remake
WHAT ARE YOU BUYIN'
estarei me dopando agora mesmo, me acordem em março de 2023
Yess!!Yes!!! LET'S GO!!
I wonder who is voicing Leon this time around.
Can't wait to meet the merchant again!
Of course I'm getting this for PC. The PS5 is a myth console.
Yo this is dope
Espero que tenha dublagem em Português do Brasil.
LESSGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
W RE4 remake
Oh baby 🥴
When you thought you got rid of Ashley.
And now for yet another completely pointless remake. Yay i guess.  They do seem to be changing the tone to be more dour and serious tho and thats definitely interesting
This and stray were the best things change my mind
Only on ps5?? What about ps4?
🫡🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
No no no I can't believe it !!!!!! It's really happening  LET'S GO!!!!!!!!!!
caraljho
I haven't been this hype for a long time!!!! I can't wait!!😤🙏
Loooks like ps2 graphics. Zamnn! What happened here?
Morir es vivir
I just hope the game is scary because the original wasnt scary at all.
Morri...🙈🙈🙈🙈..Capcom eu não um tenho PS5... Toma minha alma kkkk
I wish this version has more role to Ashley. More time playing as her would be nice.
I hope there will be a banana mod again
MAIS UMA SERIE DE RESIDENT EVIL 4 NO CANAL DO FUNKY GARANTIDO KKK
VIVA ESPAÑA
Orgasmico.........................................................................................................
Hopefully it includes remakes of ALL content from it's original release. Including mercenaries, assignment ada and separate ways.
Ta mt fodaaaaaaaaaaa
Yup I'm in!
impressionante como a capcom gosta de viver do passado pqp!
no ps4? no me hagas esto capcom 😢
Caaaaaaaraaaaalhooooouuuuuu porrraa
Tank controls and camera angle ruined the original game. A remaster would fix all these issues and make I can finally enjoy this masterpiece
Remake the ORIGINAL
Resident Evil 4 is a solid game but never was my favorite in the series. Hope that changes with this remake. Hopefully it’s better than RE3 remake
LEONNNNNNNNNN HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELPPPPPPPPPPPPP!
PORRRAAAAAAAAAAAA
leon giga chad
What's the point of a RE4 Remake if they're gonna make Ashley less ballistic-y?
y'all complain about graphics, remember this is just announcement trailer, remember re 7
My favorite game of all time REmade!!!! LFG!!!!!!
f por Mike el helicoptero 😢😢😢
❤️
Gracias, Capcom.
I just ordered Resident Evil 4 Remastered… 😐
LEON S KENNEDY Oh man is the best.
este pequeño momento de mi vida, se llama felicidad, gracias en serio.
La nostalgiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I hope this game is better than the original, and I hope it keeps its lighthearted and serious tone. With the elements of horror and action.
After playing Village I can't wait to play this one
Finally
ja estou no aguardo da gameplay do funky.
I'm especially hyped how the Regenerators would look in next gen, and the Serenity theme would sound like.
My jaws need a truck to pick them from the ground
Please, keep the perfect faces look from the original!!!!!!!!
C'est juste incroyable j'ai pas les mots
I'm just crying man. This is my childhood's game
Habrá para ps4?
Now thie was woth the wait and I hope CoryxKenshin play this game when it releases :]
I need to steal me a PS5 because *I NEED THIS GAME* 😭
I've waited a long time for this moment, and I'm hyped for that!!
This honestly feels a little unnecessary: but I will be happy to be wrong.
I really hope this is RE2 kind of remake, not a RE3 kind
Nice trailer👏
Vamos ver a Capcom torrar os fãs com o re4 agora kkk o 3 não bastou rs
That camera angle at the end almost looks old school, then he said this time things will be  different. I'm probably just reading to far into this.
CARA CARA CARA CARA
What'r you sellin?  What'r you buyin?
At this point I think Capcom has forgotten that Code Veronica exists
Espero en verdad, que no sea un fiasco como el remake del 3
Papa killstreak harus lihat ini 😂
THE ENDING WHEN LEON IS WALKING IN THE VILLIAGE , GAVE ME THE BIGGEST CHILLS; THAT MY EYES GOT WATERY !!! IM SOOOO HYPE AHHHHH!!!!
Whispers to self : "Lord Saddler..."
Will this come to PC?
WOOOOOOO
U FORASTEIROO
Code Veronica next and my life will be complete
Yes!!! Oh yes!!! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!!! Oooohhhh!!! Yeeeesssss!!! Yes! Yes!! Yes!!!
woooooooooooow my childhood in one video
I'm so happy. RE4 remake is real. :)
I honestly have mixed feelings. On one hand this does look really cool and even scary. But on the other hand, RE4 really didn't need a remake, the original game was fine. Outbreak and Code Veronica could've used a remake a lot more than RE4 did, especially with RE Village already having a very strong RE4 element to it. I'm not hating on this, like I said it looks really cool, I just feel like there were other RE games that could've used a remake more.
Hope they don't deform Leon's face as they have done to Chris. Other than that, looks amazing, and it's coming really soon!
" un forastero " Resident evil 4 👑
“Detras de ti, imbecillllll”
Not change the voice of the farmers!! Ok!? Not change!! ⚠️
Se ve increiblemente bien, ya quiero probarlooo
My thoughts after watching this  I miss Leon's og re4 voice and face  I hope they don't "modernize" AKA butcher the jokes for twitter but that's probably too much to hope for.  Im happy to see louis I want more of him and wouldn't be mad if he lives this time around  I hope Leon still flip kicks people  I'm glad they didn't make ashley look ugly, her outfit is still up for debate. I hope the same for Ada  It'd be bad if they cut content like the re3 remake I don't want that to be a trend.  The merchant deserves a standalone DLC lol   Overall I'm skeptical as i am with all this kinda stuff nowadays.
spectacular ¡¡¡¡¡¡....march 2023 thank you capcom  am excited
IH É O RESIDENT EVIL 4 REMAKE MULEKE
They make these remakes so soon that I can imagine Resident Evil 8's remake before Resident Evil 10
ps4 pls
I really like RE4 and i completed multiple times hope capcom do better Remake, cuz we still love RE4 that's Perfect Game 😊
Don't mess this up Capcom, RE3 was enough
Tao deixando a gente sonhar 🇧🇷
Looks more spooky
Capcom ignored RE Code Veronica XD
1:59 Ashley ?
gracas capcom esto es para vosotros siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii😗
IH É O RESIDENT EVIL 4 REMAKE MULEKE
So far looking freaking fantastic, I just hope it’s as long as the original but I got faith since the 2nd remake team is working on this 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
MEU DEUS ISSO TÁ LINDO
Thank you for this.
Imagine trying escape from regenerator like this, holy f*...
So it's gonna be a ps5 only not on ps4
While I’m excited and hyped for this I’m still skeptical from the remake of 3. Honestly they should of remade code Veronica. That game needs some fixes for sure. Don’t ruin 4 Capcom.
حماااااااااااااااس الف ياجماعة 🤎🤎🤎🤎
LEOOOON!!! HEEELLP!!!
wuatafackkkkkkkkk :O
Haven’t played this game since launch on GCN and can’t wait to play again like this, almost got it on vr. Also remaster Viewtiful Joe and make another
OI BRIGADO MEU DEUS
I'll keep my expectations low since Resident Evil 3 was disappointing.
classic camera?
Ps4? No? ;-;
Nos chamaram de louco mas tá aí re4 mano não vejo a hora de ouvir Leon help em 4k kkkk
Sem hype pra esse jogo, mais do mesmo, parece mais um remaster.
I feel like this coming out after Resi8 was kind of a mistake because of similar settings so they should have focused on like Code Veronica and being dropped on this date instead and like have a different team work on it, and then for Resi4 you have your main team work on it so you drop that on the 20th anniversary
No me importa como vayan a adaptar la historia, pero por favor agreguen todos los diálogos de los enemigos como en el original 🙏
Yes yes yesssssss
YO ME VUELVO LOCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Remember to Shoot the Water
أخيراً وربي حماااااس🔥🔥🔥
been waiting for this since 2019 FINALLY!!!!!!!!!
Ahhh, can't wait
Not impressed by the graphics, looks like last gen 🙄
RE4 is one of my favorite games of all time. I'm excited, but ngl, I'm also a bit nervous. This has enormous shoes to fill. Here's to a great game!
Só vem mdsss!!!
Where was un forastero ?!?!?!
This better be not another Re3R or I will not be bothered with anything Crapcom related forever.
Espero que saia pra ps4
I’m ngl I’ve never played resident evil 4 specifically because I was waiting for this
Ah yes another "help me, LEON" moment
I hope that the villagers, monks and soldiers speak Spanish as in the original. It's a detail that makes you feel like you're in "the place", just like RE5 too.
Nuevos insultos en español 🧡 "¿A ESO LE LLAMAS PAELLA?"
So ....does this mean 5 and 6 could get remade?? I feel like if they do they should do an reimagining in addition to a remake
I know this is a Playstation game but is it going to be on X-Box Series X and S too?
Wow. This is a lot of comments!  Where’d everyone come from? Bingo?
Only ps5 ?
istg this better not be another RE 3 Remake, where they rushed the game development....
This didn't need a remake.
Pro sine me upp ❤😍😍😂😂
JUEGO PREORDENADO ✋🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Saddler your small talk
Nooooooooooooooooooooooo Otra vez a aguantar a la pesada Pero igualmente juegazo el que se viene
LEON LEONNN HELP!!!!! LEONN
It's a shame that Capcom has repeated the same design of Leon's face in Resident Evil2 RE😠😠😠😠
With the mistreatment of RE3, im very cautiously optimistic about this remake.
I bet five dollars they cut everything that made re4 one of a kind
EU TÔ PIRANDO!!!!! FINALMENTE!!!!!! JÁ TÔ ANSIOSO DEMAIS!
I want to see dr. salvador
Tem que ser game do ano que nem o do RE4 Original!
*когда выйдет ремейк - это будет 16 лет с того момента, когда впервые познакомился с оригинальной четверкой. 2007 год, я учился в 7 классе. сколько же времени прошло...*
W końcu capcom w końcu, teraz tylko czekać na gameplay i demko :DDDD
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
I am so excited,  it didn't expect if the rumor was right (and it was)  it will be an Opener of State of Play. I hope they do the game like it was long (No like Re3 that they cut much content of the game)
I just hope this game isn't cut to bits like Resident Evil 3
Yo but 10 out of 10 if Leon keeps his Jacket
LEOOON HELPPPPP
It's happening.
YESSSSSS IM SO EXCITEEED!
This isn't just for PlayStation right?
Salve Brasil. Só espero que não seja um esboço de jogo igual foi feito com o RE3.
I hate to say but it looks like sh!t I'm high and even I can tell this game looks trash
Estou tão ansioso para esse remake do Resident Evil 4! Torcendo para esse jogo ser lançado para as antigas gerações de consoles, como o PS4 Pro e PS4 base.
AI PAPAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIII
...after the abysmal RE3 remake I am NOT looking forward for this. This is last gem of a masterpiece i've ever wanted a remake out off...
MANO
I do hope the campness is still there, I'm a little worried they're going in a very self serious direction.
Can't wait 🇹🇹🇹🇹
dude why this terrible graphics ????!!! in this game!!??? capcom ???
This has been my favorite game since it came out. Bricked can't even describe how hard I am for this.
This is nothing like re4…
PS5 SONYYYYYYY  where's the ps4
Your consistency and quality of content never disappoints! ❤️
Just for ps5 :(
... Ok, no signs of Wesker, Krauser and Ramon Salazar. SO FAR we can be sure that they've cut almost 30% to the game at the very least.
The game better be loyal to the look of Leon from RE4, rather than taking the young teenager from the remake
I love you Capcom <3
j
Resident evil 2 remake was great. 3 not so much. As long as the team who did 2 do this, I am excited. And hope this is as long as the original. And with that far off release date. They are taking their time with it. Compared to 3.
closer and closer it comes, started as just a rumor
i hope this game lets you play bingo
tired of remakes, got anything else?
Woooo
Please let us keep the jacket
My heart stopped for this!!!!!!!
Capcom screwed up they should of remade Code Veronica before remaking the start of Action Resi
Red9 ✊️
Woooooooooooooooooo
Where's everyone going? Bingo?
THANK UUUUUUU AAHHHHHHHH
10/10 masterpiece
el mejor dia de mi vida
I hope they keep Leon’s super cheesey quips.
Are you okay leon
I was not ready for the reveal in the beginning of the State Of Play! Let's go!!
TE AMO CAPCOM!!!! I LOVE YOU CAPCOM 😍!!!!
get rdy for missing content like Re2 and 3 remake :V
Hope is not exclusive for ps5
😍 de noche se ve muy tenebrosos, parecia la masacre de texas.
I’m so happy 😭😭😭
were there any news about re8 dlc ?
Great, another Capcom butchery of a classic. At least Resi 2 and 3 were old and clunky enough for a modern demake to make sense. Resi 4 doesn't have that problem.
Hope this game is 2 hours shorter than the original
Code Veronica definitely needed the remake more then 4 ,But eh this looks fun.
LFG
I can understand why they chose re4, but code veronica deserves a remake.... Really hope that's in the works
I definitely love this new Ashley
I hope Ashley isn't as annoying as the original.
Really hope they'll make it a true survival horror this time. I mean, not exactly like classic RE because that would mean a lot of rebalancing and redesigning things from scratch, but at least less than a "action game with horror elements". Still a bit sad that Ashley was kept, tho
Please don't be a DLC like Resident Evil 3 ;-;
🤤🤤🤤🤤
I'm praying they'll keep the "no thanks, bro" line.  It was cringe but still hilarious.
No shinji, no re4
EU ESPEREI MUITO POR ESSE MOMENTO AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Hopefully they change things up and it ends in an underground lab called NEST.
NOW DO I PLAY THE ORIGINAL BEFORE THIS OR WAIT FOR THIS TO DROP?!
Fps?
Ахуй, в это мы играем
Did they change Leon's voice actor again? It's been a while, but that doesn't sound like Nick Apostolides to me.  If it's not the same voice actor, it's very annoying Capcom can't keep consistency with its voice actors.
Só pra ps5? Mentira né
Who’s ready to be traumatized by regenerators again as an adult?   RE4 remake hype let’s go!
A little rough don't you think?
i want it! i want it! i want it! 😩
wow cant wait
They gave Ashley blue eyes now?
Ashley in ps5 😤
Huh, this is normal. WAIT A SECOND, RESIDENT EVIL 4 REMAKE JUST GOT ANNOUNCED?
MORIR ES VIVIR! MORIR ES VIVIR!
Ada Bong
Hisoka?
and ps4 ? :(
Now we gotta defend Ashley all over again 😭😭
Chubby baggy style Leon on the loose.
''Where's everyone going? Bingo?''
Show gameplay or no buy!
Wow that Leon outfit looks like from the og Re4 beta trailer
I'm just shocked when I saw this. Resident Evil 4 Remake! 😱
10 MONTHS IS TOO LONG OMFG CANT WAIT
I know alot of people stand by this game as their favorite Resident Evil but dammit I wanted Code Veronica over this tbh
WHAT ARE YOU BUYING?  This game?
Que bom que parece que não mudaram muito da história original, em vez disso espero que tenha mais conteúdo que o jogo original, isso seria o ideal.
Nah not remake again trash😒
“Hello, Stranger. What are ya buyin’? What are ya sellin’?”
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Yes! Ashley is still white!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I’ve never wanted a game more in my life like I’ve wanted RE4 to get a remake, I am BEYOND excited for this!!
"Bingo" 😭😭😭❤️
Resident evil 4 remake???
The original RE4 was ported to even phones, i don't think this game will stay only on PS5.
I like what im seeing so far, but I can already tell were gonna be getting a different tone for this game since Leon's few lines have no snark or comedic flair and is going for a more troubled emotional performance which in fairness helps it stay in tune with RE2make,  I think we'll see a difference between "jill sandwich" RE1 with the more logical and trying to sound like real people performances of Resident Evil Remake
Lindo
Oh yes 😎
Saddler sounds Horrible.  I can already see this game will cut so many content.
MENTIRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I can not believe this is real..
LEON!!!!
This looks so amazing 👏 🔥
I don't care whether yall happy or not. Capcom definitely won my heart
hope that they don´t removed all cool movements like the suplex.
🔥❤️ lo jugué el 2005... aca vamos de nuevo 🔥❤️😈
Im soo happy man, less than a year
Esperemos que ahora los aldeanos españoles no hablen como mexicanos xdd
Aleluia meu parceiro!!
Melhor resident do play 2 na minha opinião! Esse promete muito ahahaha Eu nem acredito que eles já começaram o evento assim😎👏👏
Bio Hazard 4 😳
Idk, I like the original graphics
ESTOY TAN FELIZ ME HICIERON LA PIBA MAS FELIIIIZXXXXXZZ
Worried about the dialogue so far. No campy lines as a sign that they understand one of the best things about RE4.
Cool. Would have been more excited for a CV remake 😐 but I'll take it lol
Holy cow this is a game that I am utterly shaking in my hands to play. I hope the joke about “Bingo” still be in the remastered
พี่เอกกกก ต้องมาแน้วว
RESIDENT EVIL 4 REMAKE MLK
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
😍😍RE4🤩🤩
F*ck YESSS 😭😭😭
PLEASE COME TO PCCCCCC
Resident Evil 4 reboot coming in March 2023
This has a lot to live up to.
Esse jogo tem quer ser lançado para o PS4 Pro e PS4 base, nem todo mundo migrou para a nova geração.
Ahora Ashley nos va joder en 4k 🤑🤙
Hyyyype
I hope the game is updated better game mechanics aiming-wise and running wise and dodging. I don't want it to be another remaster. I want this game to be better than what it was on GameCube.
I've never screamed so loud in my life bro, almost had tears in my eyes from how excited this got me
Holy cow!
This remake has way more horror vibe than the original!!
Will it be on PS4, especially because a PS5 is just as common as a mammoth
Most pointless thing ever
Don’t think it needs a remake, but I’ll keep an open mind.
Ashley looks so weird... I knew they would modernize her to fit the woke feminist narrative.
Eeeeita caralho, tenho placa de vídeo pra isso não, e um play tá custando um rim :'(
Okay now I’m sold
So hyped for this! Hope they actually manage to make this game scary and keep the fantastic action gameplay
O.o
Capcom: Got something that might interest ya, hehe!  Me: Thank you stranger.
im finna cry..... this game actually changed my life...
Finally been waiting for this,and just one more year lol
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!
PLEASE! Don't let this be a let down like Resident evil 3!!!
Next: Code Veronica
Really how many remakes r they gonna do? Know like keep us happy but r they working on 9th that so awesome all previous game to shame?
Ahora Ashley nos va joder en 4k 🤑🤙
Finna make it my goal to get a PS5 just for this!!!!
Can't wait to leave Ashley at the top of a ladder in HD.
i can't wait thank you capcom
Just make sure you don't cut half the game like with 3 :))
Is it the same leon actor from resident evil 2?😭
memories
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Time to hear “Leon help!!!!” All over again
All I want is Resident Evil Outbreak 1&2 Remake. I'll EVEN TAKE A REMASTERED! That game came out too soon for its time. Needs to come out now with the stabilization of online play and voice chat.
Nostalgia at its highest peak
No cambien las voces, el detrás de tu imbecil tiene que estar
UN FORASTERO!
Is it only gonna be on ps5?
Need to replay the og befor this comes out.
NOOOOO WAYYYYY
I'm BatChesting so hard.

Can't wait to meet Luis
Love it
"Detras de ti, Imbecil!", "Morir es vivir", "Un forastero!" Me pregunto si dejaran estas líneas en el remake.
Did I just see Claire?
THIS LOOKS INCREDIBLE!!!!
hope they don't pull a RE 3 Remake, cut content and shove a multiplayer game that we never wanted, unless it's RE Outbreak-esque.
My heart 😭 thank you Capcom
THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR!!!! RESIDENT EVIL 4 REMAKE IN VR 😭😭😭
Should've been Code Veronica
Кайф!!
I take back everything I said
YES YES YES
💙💙💙💙
Ashley got nerfed
I didn't like RE4 but I would be lying if I said I wasn't exited for this.
Wonder how much they'll cut from the original game...
Warum nur?
LEEOON HEELLLP!!!
Hehehehe thank you.
OMFG.
YAHAHAHAHAHYEYSYEYSYEYSEY
