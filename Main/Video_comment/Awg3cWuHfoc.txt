Man the fake youtube comments make me not wanna watch any movies lmao
This movie was diabolical!
Hey watch my movie pitch this  nov 🤫.  I am going to  sent world new horror movie franchise 🎉
Where to watch.?
they laughed in this one.
What a shit movie 4/10
A good one too - i didn't see West's last entry of his trilogy - my provider in horror gems décided  it was a total failure
Mia❤
Kid Cudi was tapping everything in this movie
aura
That thumbnail 💀
I'm go watch this again ❤
I don’t like that Jenny chortada is used as a pavement on everything Hollywood
Movie name...?
Shoutout to both mia goth characters in one shot when it shows her credit at the end
X2 ❤ With Me .
Hoy se cumplen 3 años desde el estreno de está pelicula.
wait  for it  :    Maxxxine ,  great acting and  directing . with   kevin   bacon ...
Weird gonna have to see it
It’s a good thing I didn’t buy this for $5 bucks cause I don’t want to watch the making of a porno within a horror movie.
Literally G R A N N Y
Went to see horror, just got soft core porn 🤦🏻‍♂️👎🏻
This is one of the most uncomfortable movies I’ve ever seen and I’m not telling this in a bad sense. I watched Pearl before this and I liked it a bit more. But this movie got me totally in the stomach😅
Pearl was quite good, but what the heck is this?
Movie needs a 4K disc release in the US!
What is this movie even about 😅
😂 is this horror? Is horrible
Idk why but the "That woman was in my bed touching me" gave me chills.  Ugh the memories 💀💀💀
Some say that this movie’s working title was “Twitter”.
In this show non veg. Don't eat non veg. Don't kill animals. They have feelings of pain. So understand the feelings of animals. They have their's life to live. don't distrub the life of animals. Our responsibility to save animals. SAVE ANIMALS. SAVE NATURE 🙏
Love this remix (Foghat) pity you can't get it.
where can i watch it
Need full movie download link in hindi language
I watched the film and felt traumitized after seeing kid cudi naked😮
This was such a great surprise to watch! Totally dig it's unforeseen fresh comedy and quirkiness! 5/5
How do that old lady kill most of them must be a strong old lady 😂
Horror porn movie 😨
Time to continue my Jenna marathon.
I love this movie so múch 😍😍😍❤
Why do people like this stuff? LOL
The fact that Mia Goth is 31😍👏
What is the sequel of this movie? is it X squared or Y?
Song?
wtf wrong with peoples  anyone  who can tell how was the movie
Loved this film sm
Trashh
Money grab. Looks awful with the usual violence, nudity, and some supernatural jump scares.
I  wasted about 1.5hrs of my life watching this idiotic movie. The story is so damn stupid that you will be thinking for the next few days of how  someone could come up with it 🤦‍♂️ Dont watch this if you have an IQ of over 70...
Wait. I did not know Brittany Snow was in this. Like, THE Brittany Snow? Chloe from Pitch Perfect?!
1:03 this scene made me want to watch this movie 😂
2:15 Found this jenna’s scream sound in Scream 5
The real horror of this movie is old people sex.
1:03 the line “you can’t just change the story half way through” has 3 layers of meta.   1. He’s talking about the porn film that the characters in the movie are making  2. It’s a reference to the actual movie, as in “X” since halfway through the movie it turns into a slasher  3. It’s also a reference to the trailer itself that we’re watching. The first half makes it seem like a fun movie with upbeat music, and half way through it turns into a trailer for a horror movie
Man what's with this series having a whole lot of sex
Te❤Rible😂😂
Yes. I'll watch this.  But NOT because the trailer is good. I literally had to stop halfway to get away from the stupid overuse of one half of a lyric from a classic rock song!!!!!!!
nice
Matthew mcaughny
Looks like one of those grind house exploitation films of the 70s. Can’t wait to watch it.
2024
Pearl was a way better movie
No offense but there's something off about this movie. A24 has done better
Nope. Storyline wasn't brilliant for me. It didn't have a plot twist. Its exactly what you'd expect. Performances were average. Definitely low budget.  Not realistic. None of the characters got justice. If you have time to kill, i still dont think this movie would make time pass. I had high hopes seeing comments prior but the movie didn't thrill me.  I jutd realized i had already commented on this before. But i guess i want to help ppl not waste their time.
i love mia goth
Wait isn’t this based off of pearl bc I swear she said the “Everybody’s gonna know my name, I’m a fucking star” in pearl and X
Lame
that 'one goddamn fucked up horror picture' fits well :DDD
Finally a horror movie where the final girl is bombshell
Scream Queen 👑 Cause you got that X factor 😊Now some of you might know this, some of you don't (But I Am The Scream Queen 👑 I make all the best horror movies) And Evan likes 2 say "Cause I got That X factor......He also likes getting me autographed guitars, now I had to look this song I liked in the movie up..... They're gonna put me in the movies, 😮 They're Gonna make a big star ✨ outta me! 🎉 (But I had Absolutely No clue who sang this 😮) So again I had to look this up.....(and some of you might know who this is, Some of you might not, 😮But I wanted 2 brag 😊Cause it is a REALLY cool autographed Acoustic.....and as Max says in Part 3......Im a f🤬 cking star 🌠  .
Is this a sequel to pearl?
i loove that part when RJ DIES DONT FEAR THE REAPER .....TAKE MY HAND! DONT FEAR THE REAPER
Boring film
wonderful
Takes 1h b4 anything happens.   Pretty bad
Imagine if this came out in this 80s. That vhs tape would be worn out
The A24 production doesn't have enough money to cast an old woman. So they convinced mia goth by giving some bonuses.
Jenna is soo attractive 🤤
Wtf
She looks like charlize thernon from the movie Monster. 😅
What’s A24?
How could we have known This movie would be a trilogy in two years time
Amazing
What’s the song?
This movie was a BLAST to watch honestly!!! The buildup was immaculate! The 70s aesthetics & setup was so dope! I avoided the trailer so when I finally did see it last year I had no idea of what was about to happen at all.   Avoid the trailers because it gives away some of the coolest parts & even the plot lines. I’m glad I avoided the trailer for Maxxxine as well because I saw that last night & I had a blast with that movie.
ok.. into neither horror really or most flicks along this line... didn't grow up watching Friday the 13th or Elmstreet stuff - but my god! - that damn trailer with THAT TUNE!! I HAVE TO SEE THIS! LOL AWESOME

This trailer gives away every single plot twist in the movie.  Why do filmmakers let trailermakers get away with this?
Anyone notice the Jenna Ortega scream from Scream 5 at the end? Nice little detail since Scream 5 hasn’t been released yet when they posted this trailer
Watching the movie right now. Really cool!
The fact that Mia Goth and Jenna Ortega kind of look alike ❤
Looks like a 1970s B movie.
God damn I love this movie, Cannot wait for the 3rd chapter 👏✨
Elon Musk's favorite movie😂
watched this with my mum, didn't watch the trailer first, bad mistake  Very good movie tho
з
Is MaXXXine the second chapter to this Ti West  film?  Hmmmmm?
I just watched i felt i wasted my time.... It was all predictable.
The fact that I just literally watched the movie Pearl! And just watch this trailer for this movie. So nobody realize that the old woman’s name in this movie is pearl. It’s the same house from the movie Pearl. And me at Goth playing Pearl. THATS AMAZING LOL
Such stylish trailers for real
A24, This made me laugh so much! Thanks for sharing!
AddsearchGoogIeYouTubeInstagraMheIPLiteakihsk149681984555MaPsesarch1234567890 2:24
Too much "movie" not enough horror. Jenna's character pissed at the end. Brittany ate & Kid Cudi did his thing 😏👌🏾
Just finished Pearl, decided to look up more of Mia Goth because of how brilliant she is. I've paused this video at 55 seconds so I don't ruin a thing; it already looks good. I'm very excited to watch this movie right now and go down the rabbit hole of Mia Goth movies. Mia Goth and Joaquin Phoenix are the two best actors in the world right now, in my opinion.
i’m so scawwwweddsddddd 😫😫😫😫
so... basically this trailer spoils almost everything. horror trailers are so pathetic lol.
top 1 2022 horror
Absolutely horrible these comments floating the actress the plot and twist was terrrrerrribllleee !
This movie, I think, gets a 2 /10. I was disappointed, and it wasted my time.
So glad Ti West is getting the recognition he deserves and also the cast. Mia Goth, Brittany Snow and Jenna Ortega were great in this film!
Typical American movie.. I couldn't stop laughing lol. This movie reminds me of "Tucker and Dale vs. Evil"
This is not the trailer I watched before the movie and I am glad, it gives away too much.
"-Would you like to come inside?" "-Much oblige!" 👌🏻
Formerly known as Twitter ?
What order do these movies go in I’m so confused
Foghat... I'm in.
La tengo pendiente
2:14 that scream from jenna is actually taken from the opening attack scene from scream 5.
The trailer shows way too much. Had it not, I would’ve been very surprised by the direction the movie went in.
Just finished with Pearl! Can't wait for the 3rd part!
Yo crei que era asi de drama y comedia...más thriller que de horror el sangre parece fake....me encanto todo 😊
It’s on Netflix, me any my bf had Sex to this movie
This movie was really good!
No industry for hippies
why is jenna ortega in ever horror movie known to man?
This is so sick
Do anyone realise that the farm is the same as the farm in the movie Pearl. And from the trailer itself , it feels like that this movie is the succesor of the movie Pearl .
It’s called acting not being
It's the FBI (they are at the top of domestic security) . . . but they love to play dumb when you try to express your concern about someone abusing a mind-reading technology. They eventually call you crazy and place you on the "TALKING TO YOURSELF" program aka "CRAZY PROGRAM" which is the term more commonly referred to on the street. Yep, leave it up to the government to create jobs through those they believe to be like-minded. (college grads whose institutions are so fucked up they have to use something right? Crazy check anyone? SSDI?) The result is what was once a society based upon trust; has now turned into a leaderless society and rapidly becoming one where no leadership can be generated due to the decimation of trust. That's what enigma does. It decimates trust. And this is why the FBI like you to believe EVERYONE's an FBI agent . . . because they know they are fucked.
This is one of the best trailers I have ever seen! Sometimes I just like to watch it over and over.
Fully loaded
Pearl is so good and makes more sense watching this after pearl
Mia so hot
LOVED this film❤ Mia Goth is my new favorite actress😍. but i have to say what captivated me the most was that from the beginning u can kind of tell that Maxine had something special about her, despite not being on “the right path” it goes to show God doesn’t judge and loves the ppl who loves Him. that’s what think from this movie !!
Look whose talking
Elon musk's fav movie
It's on Netflix
Great movie! Different!
This trailer just spoiled the whole movie, including how some of they die and get injured, even THE ENDING! 🤣
HOW to download please reply me??
they should've just let granny do a scene
I’m back. Still greatest trailer ever
When I watched this I really liked it, but I didn’t LOVE it. But it got under my skin and it’s stuck with me. Definitely needs a re-watch.
Ngl this movie was hot ass and weird asf💀
The joke in this movie
TERRIBLE
This movie is so dumb! theres nothing new here, all the characters doing dumb things and choose the best way to die, Mia Goth character Maxine is the only smart character in the entire film, the ending was the only "good" about this movie.

Wtf is with these comments? Bots? This movie was garbage from start to finish.
I thought i was watching a horror movie lol 😂 had to turn that mofo down
Good movie, give it a watch
1 (actually, two) jumpscares in ONE shitty trailer. average boring horror shit. terrible movie. not gonna watch this one, thank you
Funniest and creepiest movie I’ve ever seen.
It's not good, I don't recommend it
If you ever have a bad Airbnb experience. Just watch this movie.
Looks dumb
Anybody know whats the song that was playing in the background ?
okay im gonna say it we all did watch this movie to see jenna ortegas boobs
я ебать угарал на моменте когда бабка хотела заебашить кокаинщицу и от дробаша улетела нахуй
The initial scene with the cops coming at the house should’ve been cut imo. GREAT movie however
Probly my favourite, Ti West film.
A movie full of porn visuals with gore 😭

Borrowing heavily from THE VISIT
Absolute shite

Disgusting movie 🤮🤮 2/10
Isso me lembrou MUITO o trailer do álbum escandalo íntimo da Luísa sonza, é sério, assistam esse trailer, a vibe é IGUAL a desse
I LOVE THIS MOVIE !!! Sickkk
Jenna, tan maravillosa igual que siempre, ella es la única razón por la que miro la película.
Where can I watch this movie?
Ti West is very special. One thing we can thank Trump for: a golden period for horror movies
Whats the hype about this movie?...It Sucks!
Garbage. Don’t watch
Damn Martin Henderson doesn’t get a mention along with the rest of the cast?
Worst horror movie I have seen in ages😩 can't belive someone think this film was scary😂😎
Please don’t waste your time watching this goofy ass movie.

Mediocre movie and you cant see anything because everything is im the dark. Dont waste your time.
It's like granny gameplay with real 😂😂😂
😛😛😛🥰👅🫦😛
How is it that people are saying this is a good movie? Literally just wasted an hour and 46 minutes of my life on this garbage
Esta pelicula es fantastina, los actores, la musica, todo es una satisfaccion de verla.... recomendado
Buena pela fuerte, graciosa y suspenso en algunas partes la volveré a ver
Una muy buena película, te engancha de principio a fin.
Cuando sale en Netflix esta película de jenna ortega? La quiero ver esta en Netflix pero no se puede ver
Jenna Ortega, mi actriz favorita, muy buena película.
Que buena película, entretenida y gratificante, la recomiendo para pasar la tarde
Ameee esta película,  es una película completa,  que entretiene y envuelve
Wow, Mia Goth looks a lot like a young Shelley Duvall. I watched pearl, and she is a very good actress. I really like her
Es excelente película
🤢🤮
If Elon Musk made a movie
Bullshit
After reading these comments I was excited to see the movie everyone rated it as a great movie but after watching I was so dissatisfied, this movie is trash I’m sorry the entire movie is just them having sex for over a hour and the killing dosent even happen til the last 30 min of the movie. I was expecting more since this was classified as a horror movie but this was just boring to me definitely would rate it a 3/10. I’d never watch this again honestly it’s a 1 and done for me
excelente
💩💩💩
Essa é a continuação de peal?
Movie name????
What is the name of the song ?
Filme toppp muito bom já não vejo a hora de vez👏👏👏

Classic 🔥😊
🖤great slasher movie👏happy to have seen something new and original. Blood, guts, sex, madness and some really funny scenes 😂
Why is this added to Princess Nokia playlist? 💀
I wonder if Elon Musk likes this movie?  He’s obsessed with the letter X after all!
This movie is fucking boring
why is Mia Goth career centred around porno? lmao
American country side?? sign me in
Good movie
I’m not sure why these movies have to be so cringe. The first one with the scare crow and this one with a 90 year old pearl touching the other girl in her sleep. Other than that the movies are decent but I don’t get all the hype.  Jenna Ortega was the only likeable character to me.
What song is in the background?
Hi
I don't know what there's to really like about this movie if I'm being honest, the setting and the acting of their group is pretty good sure, but it's not a horror, it's got a bit of gore, and it's not anything exceptional as a slasher? It's a pretty decent movie up until the mid point when things start to unravel, every death is entirely predictable which takes any fun out of the slasher aspect, people like this just because it's a 'horror' movie where the plot has substance and falls into place like any movie actually should, like is that it? Is the bar so low for horror movies? And what's this new trend with just putting naked old people in these? At least it's relevant to the story here, but I'm sorry this is like some trend now, I don't want to spoil things listing them off but it's just lame lol. Watch out there's a naked grandma, uh oh, she's horny in this one! I'd say this is a maybe 5/10 as it's nothing really that interesting, it's got good production quality but felt boring to me with it's predictability, there's probably a better slasher somewhere you could watch that'd be more fun than this.
My mom walked in on me and my sister watching this movie right when kid cudi was fuckin the girl from pitch perfect.
The movie is full of sex😂😂😂❤
😂😂😂😂2025
wow they already made a movie about the new Twitter name a year before?
Some great kill scenes. Bring on MAXXXINE
Can't wait for the sequel: Y
👎👎👎👎👎👎🏻

These movies are so trash that they can make 3 in one year.
Lots of 🦶🦶in this and that’s ok by me
If they’d only brought Ron Jeremy.  He’d have hit it.
Elon brought me here.
XMAN XMAN XMAN 🙅🏽🙅🏽🙅🏽
I only want to see this because of Jenna. She has become one of my favorite actress and she kills every role she has been given. ❤❤
Pure pretentions shit. For some reason, people are in a species of collective hysteria for this a24 company. I've seen some good movies they made, such as the witch and the lighthouse, but most of the movies are or meh, such as midsommar, or a complete dogshit like this one and "man". This one is a pretty bad slasher movie, the kills are ludicrous, the plot is terrible, it's nonsensical, and the characters ares lame too. It's not as bad as man, the most pretentious shit movie I ever saw, but this is really bad too. That scene with the gator for example, it's just to say like "look how we can make a different style of framing and shooting". And it fails even to build tension. It's definitely not a scary movie, there is some jumpscares that are just terrible too, like when wandinha is looking for her boyfriend and the porn guy appears. Just lame. Don't waste your time. Most people say they liked this to pretend to be smart. As I wise man I know once said, it would be better if I went to see dwarf porn!
Old people are scary lol 😅😅😅😂
Super shit
Wow! Watching this got me feeling like someone just made a movie based on Słoń from @BrainDeadSlon songs :D :D, freaking awesome!
I was sitting watching this movie and half way through I realised Jackson is Kid Cudi.. blew my mind.
Telugu legends welcome..✊Like here
This movie sucked you don’t even get a kill scene until an hour after the movie starts. Snooze fest
I would like to see what is X
Best horror film I’ve seen since the Texas chainsaw massacre
Great movie. But no way could Pearl hid RJs body or all that blood so soon. Was all over the truck too. Blood spraying up and backwards also. Lol.  Could let that even slide but no way could move or hide body and blood that quick.
Before Twitter, X is  movie first😂
Hahaha new twitter name
Didn't know there was a horror movie about Twitter
bro thinks hes twitter
twitter change to x
Nebelwerfer 42
Too nice, and EPIC!!! I love the film score and it was well made. Can't wait to see 'Pearl'
This movie is terrible. It’s watching these people have fake sex for the first 30 minutes of the movie… couple with awful southern accent impersonations. I just turned it off
Love Horror, Thriller??? Let's just search A24 on Google
It's a horrible movie, very disgusting, and really tasteless, don't waste your time watching that.
Any more movies like this
Any more movies like this
this move has another part called "Pearl".  It's the story of the old women and how she turned into a killer when she was young.
2:14 they really cut jenna's scream from scream 5 and edited it on here
I love ❤️ this movie, Mia Goth is perfect with an impeccable performance ✨..The terror💀is wonderful🖤
I think it’s crazy how much Martin Henderson really looks like Luke Wilson
So, what are you expecting me to do? Google for "X"?
Very nice movie and Mia Goth is simply an excellent actress, just why did they use exactly the same scenes as in the Pearl movie ?
🎉😮  ‏‪1:59‬‏
The actors did such a good job
The money shot
Garbage
And I was disgusted
Xxxx
"Wadda ya think is on it?" More shit horror movie. Just like this one. The problem translates to music as well: Proliferation of shit. Too much to wade through to find any good ones. *Muah* Bloody kisses.
that was the longest 2:24secs of my life lol.
I love how if you listen very carefully you can hear an Alligator growling. A nice tease that the Film will feature an Alligator after some tasty humans.
MIA GOTH IS THE SHIT !!!!!
Jenna = movie good 😂❤
Like old people….
meh I loved Pearl so much, had many expectations for this but it really never made sense, didn't feel like a continuation of the first but more like an attempt to make the first story a bit longer but nothing unique, nothing surprising and the plot was sooooooooooo used before. So disappointed, love Mia though,
Loved X and Pearl so much!  X is like a quiet homage to Texas Chainsaw Massacre and all the exploitation films of the era. And Pearl has superb Hitchcock vide to it, very reminiscent of Psycho in a lot of ways.  Brilliant story telling and horror 👌
This trailer is probably the best film trailer I’ve ever seen
Where can I watch the full movie?
55:05 He gon cry when he get 2 the car😂
Wait  Is that X and pearl friends house farm?
Honestly, if my tenents started making pornos in my house without telling me, I'd be pretty mad too. Clearly the old lady wanted to be in the film and she was upset she was not included in the creative decision making process lol.
Todo el tiempo pensé que esta película era “Pearl “ ☠️
can't say enough how good this film was. I loved it from start to end. The performances were immaculate, the cinematography was on point and the plot was perfect.   The gore and effects were flawless. Absolute loved this film from start to end
wooooooo hooooooooo round of aplouse for jenna ortega
Jenna is amazing
I love jenna
wtf give me my 2 hours back, this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life, what the ????!!!!!!
I have to be honest, this was the first time A24 disappointed me. The story that revolved around the old folks is the only redeeming quality of the movie besides Ortega and Goth. If the narrative was done from their perspective, the story would of had a better chance. The build up was 45 minutes of garbage filler and most of the pay offs were lack luster at best. I think  the writer's thought process went abundantly towards the final scene which was really good and had some emotional value to it. Jenna Ortega and Mia Goth played their parts very well, but an extra tip of the hat goes to Goth for doubling as Pearl which was a decently written character. But come on, after watching a far amount A24 films, this is by far the weakest so far.
Ti West giving us the works and I’m obsessed
Film name?
We all know why the most replayed tick is at that mark.
Everyone is talking 'bout jenna ortega, but have you seen mia goth?🤩
SFW SIEND.
God knows how this movie got over 90% on Rotten Tomatoes. My partner and I watched this and couldn't even finish it. It takes at least an hour to even get into it properly after all the dumb porn/sex garbage, then when it does, it just gets weird. Not worth the watch.
I hate jenna just because of her fans who are acting like she is a God
Watch this movie really high, you'll thank me later ❤❤❤❤❤❤ it was a beautifully experience... The gore, the ambience, the soundtrack, the score, Jenna Ortega is definitely the new scream queen after Samara Weaving of course ❤
isn't this a kind of sequel of Pearl? Like, the wife is called Pearl, that's the same house and the same farm...
Which movie ???
One fucked up God damn horror picture. That about sums it up and I finally got to see Brittany Snow's titties. If that is not enough of a review to make you want to watch this then you're beyond help. It was a cool as hell movie.
1 year old!  Good not great  This takes its sweet time to get to the gruesome stuff  We spend the first half of this just concentrating on the film crew, making their smut picture, and watch them debating about it's necessity to the ongoing public  It is good-looking like an authentic 70s picture from that era with the zoom ins, the music, first person POV shots, the fashion, and the old millimeter film aesthetic  Really is one of the more disturbing, uncomfortable flicks to come out in a while given what goes on in this household It'll definitely make you squeamish and also hard to look away from  Ti West needs to work on his pacing and editing but the movie has plenty of callbacks to old slashers from 'Texas Chainsaw' to 'Psycho' even if they aren't more spread throughout  Definitely relies on shock value for sure
I love everything about this movie but Jenna Ortega doesnt feel like she belongs among the character. I dont know if its the character or the way she acted it but she seemed contemporary and not from the 70s
Pourquoi tu mets pas en français😭😭😭😭😭
wtf
The movie was okay, it wasn’t awful but not great either. It’s more of a thriller than horror.
Il a raison ! Si tu regardes les grosses entreprises, les fondateurs sont des hommes ( Apple / Twitter / Facebook/ Instagram/Amazon/Aliexpress/Google) pour ne citer que ça
I can’t find it
All hail Jenna Ortega..... Our new scream queen. bro i was waering headphones my- MY EARS
esta aburrida cesar vale verga esta pelicula
X
My opinion (my opinion) not good enough to say a very good "scary movie"
Bullshit and stupidity
CXC
Gonna watch this now
😂
stupid movie you guys dont waste your time worse movie I have ever seen b4
No entiendo qué dicen, ¿por qué me dirigen a un enlace en un idioma que no me interesa? Dejadnos en paz, cansinos...
I LOVE MIA GOTH
Jenna so cute god damn
Go crazy with the cheese whiz
Wtf did i just watched.. its not for everyone some scenes are gross
Another absoloute masterpiece!!!! First I watched Infinity Pool, AMAZING, now X; and next Pearl. This Mia Goth truly is phenominal. She played two characters in this too!!!! Wow. Jenna is doing pretty damn good too, especially with the Wednesday thing.  Mia Goth tho. My god what an amazing actress. Woman, you can do any role cant you. But your skill really shines in the crazy insane roles.  If your considering whether or not you should watch this movie, you should. Then follow it up with Pearl. Then I would check out Infinity Pool. So far, amazing, all of them. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Also, good depth and concepts behind each one so far. 10/10.
1:40 GAWWD DAMN IT MUST’VE BEEN COLD FILMING THERE

I just finished watching Pearl minutes ago and just finding this out . Timing couldn't been more better  Edit: nvm "X" was pretty disappointing lol
Scary movies are so garbage recently
deft
Why are old people played by young actors in disguise?  there were no old actors?
It's like a B grade 80s horror, one you get cheap at the video shop. If you like those you'll like this but to see people saying phenomenal and ground breaking, please... Stop the cringe
Name music please ???????
FILMONE
Why is Jenna Ortega in every movie lmao
I didn't complete the movie yet but in my opinion I am just feel SUPER HARD HOPE MY CUCUMBER RELAX A LITTLE
Does Jessica Ortega take her clothes off in this? That's something I'd literally pay for
This movie is messed up lol
Jenna Ortega😱
Impressive on every level - my eyes were glued to the screen the whole time! Will immediately seek out and watch Pearl.
I felt sorry for the old lady, she just wanted to be loved... and the kids disrespected her 😥 She just needed someone to tell her she's beautiful!
I really loved this movie x is the most interesting best movie ever made
I swear Brittiany Snow does not age
X and Pearl are fucking amazing I’m so so so so so excited for MaXXXine
Good acting for sure but how things played out was just not impressive to me. I mean cmon how many times have we seen someone step on a nail or look through a crack and get something in their eye?? Same old horror cliches in that aspect. But agree the acting is good.
Ok
woo
Okay now this is a horror movie 😂😂  I was skeptical before watching this but I am glad that I did. Would love watching this movie again with no memory of it. A24 is at it again 💯 The killing scenes were so good. Something which I wasn’t expecting.
Song???
Eu vou ser sincero o filme é bom mas totalmente fora da realidade são dois velhinhos frágil demais se fosse a vida real com certeza esses dois velhinhos e a morrer muito rápido
God I loved this movie. Best horror film in a few years in my opinion. Probably my favorite since Hereditary.
A24 chutando a porta e bebendo da fonte dos clássicos!
Has Mia goth ever been to Texas?
Wtf is this shit
I watched for Jenna ortaga
Jenna Ortega fans hit likes  here 👇
Wait so is this just Pearl actually making it out of the farm haha
A24 didn’t even make this movie
Rip for those who thought this was horror😭😂
Es lenta al principio Y después es cliché todo Que se yo 4/10
What kind of visual treatment does it have?
Worst movie ever  Just don’t waste your time
I saw this movie tonight and it was very very great
Jenna Ortega plays in this.
Anyone thinking this is a horror is mistaken..I have no idea why it's described as one but it isn't at all. It's about porn so obviously it isn't horror
Jenna Ortega is so hot, she is my celebrity crush
My ex has sent me this link and I've very confused as to why
miaaaa jennnna 2 in one lesss goo
best ke cite nieyh ?
ada kat tv3 ke
The scariest part was when the elders were having sex 😖😖😖
POV: I see Jenna Ortega in the cast me: 🏃‍♂️ 🏃‍♀️ 🏃‍♂️ 🏃‍♀️ 🏃‍♂️ 🏃‍♀️ 🏃‍♂️
Mia Goth is much more beautiful than Jenna Ortega
I’m so over this nonsense.
0:53
Porque de tal manera amó DIOS al mundo que dio a su único hijo (JESÚS) para que todo aquel que en ÉL cree no se pierda, mas tenga vida eterna Juan 3:16
神愛世人，甚至將他的獨生子（耶穌）賜給他們，叫一切信他的，不至滅亡，反得永生約翰福音 3:16
Porque DEUS amou o mundo tanto que entregou o seu Único filho (JESUS ) para que todo aquele que NELE crer não pereça, mas tenha vida eterna João 3:16
For GOD so loved the world that he gave his only son (JESUS) so that whoever believes in HIM should not perish but have eternal life John 3:16
Pearl is way better, this movie was boring
The worst movie I ever watched. The  porn stars live to long.  The one that I thought had a brain also betrays you. The kills where kinda ok so will give it a 3/10. The kills boosting it to the 3.
mia goth and jenna ortega looked so similar to me in the trailer that i was initially super confused lol edit: i know they're wearing different outfits and have different makeup, but still...
Probability distribution
A24 gonna make y'all learned today!
Fun fact: Jenna's scream at 2:14 is from Scream 5 when she is attacked by ghostface
Boring movie
What is the movies name X or is there a other name ?
Sssflm
Ti West should direct a new Friday the 13th movie. These shots were perfect, the atmosphere, and the haunting music in some scenes just couldn’t help but remind me of those movies
Where can I see this?
Mia Roth is overrated…. Just a horror girl…..
Brilliant movie if any of any of you are still unsure 👍🏼
2:03  This is basically every grand kids out there worst nightmare!
Its hard to search the name of the movie on internet.... (X movie)
Like kare jo jo Wednesday series ke baad yaha aaya hai
I love A24 also but I have to say.. it sounds like a gangggg of A24 producers, crew and background leaving reviews on here😁
Which two people was  at the end of this trailer
So Mia Goth and Ti West both did a psychological horror about showbiz coming to a small southern town with a very important plot point about caring for the elderly? In the same year???
Que pedazo de película
There’s just something so sinister when they pull up to the farm
Is this sequel to pearl?? 🤣🤣
Binge watching Wednesday before watching this movie really messed with my view lmao. because the whole movie I keep saying "Wow, she looks like Jenna Ortega" and then I see the cast, I'm so dumb lol.  it is a great movie tho, I would never expect Mia Goth actually playing Pearl the old woman, Holy she's crazy talented. Can't wait to watch PEARL
Britney snow?!
I should run my own bloody restaurant seeing how this guy literally freezes frozen pasta
I have not seen this movie but i watched pearl and it was amazing
Can anyone explain what they liked about this movie or why they thought it was good other than it was different? Not all different things are good.
kpuk - назBaнue фuлbмa
Marks the spot
Watched it last night and got one word: disturbing.
Please let this be as good as I want it to be.
What's the name of the song?
Bots: “I love how he never disappoints us with his content”
Who knew that having a good chef is more important than believing in yourself?
Yes we are here after Wednesday 😎
I watched your video through thoroughly and when it came to the final seconds at the end i was enlightened at how that figet spinner spun
Always fighting the customers
what a twisted, warped, piece of Holly-weird crap!
Hi
I don’t know how I didn’t realize that was Kid Cudi and Brittney Snow 😅, I of course recognized Jenna though
does this movie have any connection to the other A24 movie "pearl", i feel like I'm seeing so many signs including the fact the old lady name is pearl, but i just want to be sure.
Solo por jenna ortega ❤️la veré
too many this kind of movie already
Man when he said “it happens after dark” I instantly thought of the syndrome known as “Sundowning” in Alzheimer’s and Dementia sufferers where they are fine during the day but as soon as the evening hits or the sun goes down that dementia/Alzheimer’s kicks in HARDCORE
like Felix over reacting to the pasta being cooked before service
Wednesday
That ending was definitely worth the wait
This movie is boring maniwala kayo sakin kulang sa mga kill scene at intense na pangyayari
random but im happy to see brittney snow back at it
24 ???? VOCE E GAY !
We need more of this Pewds. We need more nightmares. Urgently.305
anybody knows the song? sounds like reverend and the makers but cant find it
So the old woman is Pearl? Wickedddd
The only time porn and horror were this good together 🔥 🔥
Brittany Snow and Jenna Ortega in one film? OMG im so late
Wow, I had no idea that Mia Goth played both Maxine and Pearl. Owen Campbell was also unrecognizable as RJ.
Eh, X was alright. I would not necessarily recommend it. The exposition was unnecessarily long, and the movie in general was not scary.
Wednesday??
Is it necessary to watch X before Pearl?
I just wanna say great movie. Was not expecting a lot of things. Provo ❤❤❤. Oh and the 70s vibe, felt like I timed travel just to see this. So different. Wish more horror movies made me jump like this one. The plot and everything was very original as well.   P.s. I never write movie reviews but yeah. You get my point 😊
This looks absolutely terrible. Is it worth the watch?
I should run my own bloody restaurant seeing how this guy literally freezes frozen pasta
lolllll Mia Goth😆😆😆 FAIL...
Hmm... The most replayed part. 🧐😕
This trailer/promotion pulled a scream here with Bobby Lynne/ Brittany Snow. Scream in the posters and promos made Drew Barrymore to be the main character or at least a main character by putting her face in the posters and being the most famous actress of the cast at the time. Here They featured Bobby Lynne/ Brittany Snow a lot and had her name displayed first (while Mia Goth “the final girl” last)
Accidentes insolitos
Is this good yes or no ??
What song is this???!!!
MIA GOTH❤
What the name of the song in the trailer?
It's looks like sequel for pearl, really. Same mia goth, same farm house, same studio. And the fact the old woman played by mia goth her self are just 😶
Damn that movie sucks 1/10
Gotta love sexual trauma!
Loved pearl more cause it has a plot but this have more gore scenes, Waiting for the third movie! I think maxine will fail to be a star just like pearl lol
The sheriff officer said the end of the movie is hilariously by his answer to the another other question from the other sheriff officers. 😂😂😂
'its better to beg for forgivness then ask for premission'
Foghat - I Just Want To Make Love To You If anyone was wondering what the song is 👍
0:44 Music? Can anybody help?
Tayari
_0:25__ song name??_
Stfu all of you. The movie sucked
A24 if you see this I would love to die in one of your movies 😂
Is this movie still connected to "Pearl"?
Seeing Pearl's credit scene accidentally wow just wow
straight p0-n is so disgusting 🤢
ive been searching on whats the music name? can someone tell me? or is this just from the X movie
Im shocked how bad that Movie was! Waste of Time. So stupid
So everything makes sense in X now after I watched Pearl. I regret hating on this movie I legit didn't get it.
This trailer is a masterpiece. Saw the movie, and it was mediocore.. boring like most horrormovies
So X and Pearl are the same storyline??🤯
SERVED
is this the continue of pearl?
That vibes tho, damn so excited!!!
La vieja esa me dio un asco y miedo
I was actually suprised to see a death scene....thats how slow this shit was. Old Lady horror was not a thing ( and still isnt)
Ye all need to watch Pearl now
i came here to know if this movie connected to Pearl movie.... it surely is
Shoulda just called it Pearl 2
she's just an old lady though... like there's a whole group of them and they're all in the prime of their lives?? they can't even overpower a feeble old woman?!! i doubt there's anything supernatural involved so what the hell??
Anybody know the song?
is this connected to "Pearl"?
Decent movie.. would've been great if I could've seen 60% of it. Literally a blackscreen for more than half the movie
I think I’ve already commented but this is the best trailer ever made
Brittany snow and Jenna Ortega is in this holy crap!  Looks good! Might actually be worth watching
MALISIMA!!!!!! Previsible, aburrida y llena de clichés... Y sin ningun fondo....
Whos playing old women?
A24 is the new master of modern horror. So glad to see American horror back on top.  J and K-horror have some catching up to do! :D
6 young people can't hold their shit together against 2 old people over 80.
alguém sabe onde eu posso assistir esse incrível filme??
Saw this today. It was ok.
Imagine traveling in the rural country in the 70s or even the 80s  It's so many people that missing due 2 serial killers an mass murderers
This got those Texas chainsaw massacre vibes  See you can pay homage to movies while doing your own thing not everything has to be a reboot of the same thing just worse
What a movie! Incredibly well shot. The guitar scene hit me like a ton of bricks. It could have been so easy to ride on stereotypes but it's beautiful it was avoided.
pov: you accidentally typed x on google and landed here
I’m confused. Mia goth is in a film called Pearl…..then she’s plays this old woman call Pearl as well as the younger girl…..I need answers. Both films out at the same time…it’s confusing
For some reason this reminds me of the movie Pearl that just came out
Uuuu scary old lady that can't even wipe her own 💩, terrifying .....
The southern accents in the trailer were distracting. 70's porn actors were all from NYC or LA.
That one guy’s like Mathew McConaughey meets Kurt Russell.
I wonder if this storyline is a continuation of the movie “Pearl” with Mia Goth being the lead role
this is a bad and lame movie.
"my wife pearl" IS THIS SOMEHOW CONNECTED TO THE MOVIE PEARL
I luv Cudi and Brittany Snow but this look dumb as hell lol
just got back from seeing Pearl, now I get to watch this movie.
Here for my girl Jenna 😫💕
I love how they used the song.  Took it and turned it into something creepy and sinister
This movie was wild 70s porn with horror ending was crazy
Super 👌💯🤗😱😨
UNFORTUNATELY,,-ALLLLLL THEE "actors"-are Lame and have ZERO IT factor,,,🙄🤢🤮🤮🤮🙄😒🙄
Just here to say Mia Goth is so sexy.
"I fell bad if I hurt him, I don't want to break up" Well, you litteraly fucked another guy while he was filming it sooo ... She deserves her end
Bought the movie yesterday. Excellent!! I really enjoyed it.
This was a great movie. The lines are hilarious
It's Jenna(or Jenni) Ortega?
Christopher multisante directed this movie for sure
Funny cheap movie
x
Isn’t this like pearl ?
X
I don't know what it's about throwing shit at movies like these, they always say let the well-known franchises die and don't do any more sequels or remakes, but if they then make an original movie like this, they also say it's bullshit, anyway, pure hypocrisy.
Pearl and X need to both come out on a collector DVD set.
One of the worst movies I've seen in YEARS.
Quentin Tarantino vibes anyone ?
Since pearl is coming out I wanna watch this again
"I say one goddam fucked up horror picture" 🥰
Was Jenna Ortega one of the girls on Gossip Girl?
I dont understand how this is the prequel, being that Pearl looks really outgoing. So you're saying that first she was outgoing in X, and then she became a frightened little mouse in Pearl (who later became a monster I know, but still it doesn't make sense to me).
Watch this then Pearl.. Its better that way.
This movie was so SLOW. I felt a  bit intrigued at first but midway through I was so bored. It consists mostly of sex and sex.. expected more horror/thriller.
How on earth did I never even see a trailer for this movie??  I am here b/c somebody mentioned the new movie Pearl.
Recommended to watch this first or Pearl ?
After seeing the trailers to both movies... tonight "X", for a bday gift to myself tomorrow..."Pearl". Hopefully they are both as good as I want them to be.
Bakwas movie, Time waste  Asei Slasher movie her movie me dekhchuka hnu kuch naya nahi he
Faltu Bahiat Ghisipiti Slasher movie
because of Pearl i'm finally wanting to watch this !!!!
This movie was INCREDIBLE
This looks much better than Pearl.... which was pretty rough.
Trash movie sex sex.. And sex i was prepared for a horror /thriller movie  Go watch martyrs and you know how a real thriller is Also the camera man should of stayed alive but who cares he's trash too
worst movie of A24 ...............
Way better then nope
Can someone explain how this movie is related to the movie pearl?
Can’t believe they made a prequel and sequel for this already
Thats how the albino girls got their attention through Pourne and getting used and dumped all over
It’s something about the picture of her screaming that just draws me to the movie nws!
Total shit movie. Looks like a 50k budget bullshit
This movie was HORRIBLE hot garbage
This movie was an extreme disappointment. An entire hour of pointless footage. Porn, gore, and no plot whatsoever. 1/10 only because of Mia Goth. 😂
This out yet
This was a good flick.  The old couple took the creepiness to a whole new level.  I thought the ending didn't live up to the journey, but hey, the journey sure was some ride!
Pearl looks better
This movie is fuckin fireee🔥
Song name anyone?
This is one of the best movies I've seen.
looks spooky 👍
Great movie 10/10
This movie RULED. They made it original but at the same time, they kept the same formula. Its already a classic horror film (imo).   It’s funny, for YEARS they kept trying to recreate the same recipe with Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but it was just box office blood money. They’re boring and lazy, unremarkable really. Horror fans know that…maybe they just….    needed that “X” factor.
So... when do the xmen show up?
This movie is 6 pounds of shit in a 5 pound bag.
Ass movie trash movie smh. Whoever wrote this need to be slapped.
Man gone. I’m in disbelief the reason for all this happening I really can’t believe it. Absolutely dumb af bro yall tripping. I nem watched every horror movie ever created (exaggeration obviously) and the reason for what happened in this movie is literally dumb af. Idc Idc Idc.
Aint no way what happened in this movie happened for the reason it happened for no way. No way no way no way.  No way. Aint no way.   Nah nah nah.  Nope.
Loll this movie was shit, comments below are obviously fake. This movie was garbage
Sweet Jesus..I can't unwatch what I just saw...No words..just go see it for yourself..
bof 😏
I'm glad I watched this without seeing the trailer cuz that closing line was hilarious knowing whats really on there!
¨Pr0n
entire movie on the trailer, no need to see it anymore. hahahaa
Finally somebody got a good cast with a good script and a cameraman that iknows his stuff. Take me back to the Starlight Drive, cold Schlitz and some Funyns~~!
Watched the first 53 minutes. Too slow and boring
Enjoyed the movie overall, but it suffers like most horror movies...no one sticks together and they die one by one. If you go to a place you've never been before and there are "questionable" people you are staying with, you just trust everything will go to plan lol?
Pior filme que já assisti na vida
Трэк?
"My wife Pearl is next door.."
Glad I didn’t watch the trailer before I saw the movie. Shows way to much.
The ending make this really would be found footage movie
Omg what a terrible trailer. Am glad I watched the movie before seeing this, it does not do it justice at all.
Loved it !!! It just got better and better And more disturbing, were those freaky old people part of a cult? Or just to christian ?
not completely terrible if only because they show Brittney snows tits but wtf was with the 2 parts in the movie when it cut back and forth? it made no sense and was utterly stupid
A24 made me watch the movie and let me tell you, I regret it. Do NOT waste your time, the movie had no storyline what so ever. Had potential but it was just shoot, stab, kill, the end
Basically everybody dies movie like that:(
Really enjoyed. Great surprise. Not pretentious. Simple. Tense. Well directed. Good storie telling.
Came on this by accident ..  F loved it .. A great movie, plot line and twists, re sequels and prequels .. Hooked ..
0:03 pretty sure that is where they shot the gas station coin toss scene in "No Country for Old Man" Mentality is everything.  Shes just a weak old lady but becuz shes a psycho killer, she seems to have power over everybody. Just beat her like u would an old lady,, so unless shes a ghost or something which it doesn't looked like the case here, just beat her ass down!!  Now, so if u become a victim, just set ur mind on crazy evil heartless psychopath, and tell urself this is what u want and like, and ur going to have fun killing whoever is in ur way or whoever put u here, its ur plan
Looks kinda neat is it worth buying?
this movie was a total waste of my fkng time. why the hell are there all these comments saying it's good
I actually loved this movie and I can't wait for pearl
Nice
How come Chelsea Wolfe's music isn't in the trailer?
Explicit detail
Mía Goth te amo.
where can I watch it ?
this movie is about the succubus hag that visits you in nightmares/sleep paralysis due to your sinful lifestyle
Mia Goth reminds me of a young Shelley Duvall meets Warhol superstar Jane Forth!
im glad i went to see the movie before watching this trailer
é uma merda, não assistam esse cagalhão
I was expecting way more from it. Hereditary was way too good.
I never saw this and I just now saw the trailer for, Pearl.  Now, I definitely want to see this.  My initial thinking is... can't they handle this old woman?
sex, horror and great casting. the only downside is the fact that they always put beautiful women like brittany snow and jenna ortega with men far less attractive
i ❤️ mia goth
This movie scared the shit out of me
“The story can’t just change midway through” X movie= “bitch, try me!”
I really miss this movie for sure
pro-race mixing liberal scum movie garbage , disgusting and disgraceful to say the least
Usually before going for the movie I check out the trailer and then decide whether I should watch it or no. And whenever I see A24 I stop right there and book the tickets.
Holy shit i thought that was kid cudi
Nahhh it’s way too scary 😭
Foghat getting some attention... Nice.
Just watched this. Absolutely outstanding!
Please, name intro song of that trailer ??
does anyone know where i can find the version of the song used in this trailer? i have been looking since i saw it and it seems like it doesn't exist anywhere but in the trailer. if anyone can find it or even cut out the movie words and make it themself, please let me know, its so good, thanks.
I haven’t seen this movie yet, planning to soon, but I love the way the trailer is edited.
Anyone know the music in trailer?
Как называется фильм
❤
who else is back here after seeing the new "pearl" trailer?
I love this movie
I had to look it up 😂 I had no idea Mia played Pearl in X 🙄
Mia Goth looks like Aileen Wuornos
Is that kid Cudi!?
Did anyone else immediately think the love witch when you saw the blue eyeshadow?
Didn’t Mia Goth play both the old woman and the young woman? She’s phenomenal.
Recently watched this movie it's good
Can i ask what font did they use for the glowing text
"...one goddamned fucked up horror picture."  I'm in!
In less than half a year this thing got a Prequel.
I must have been living under a rock...or this movie got lost somewhere between Moncton & Halifax because the trailer for Pearl brought me here. both look so cool and deadly.
Texas chainsaw but the killer is a lady
🙏❤️
This is a dumbass trailer. Spoiled everything.
WHY IT GIVES SO MUCH OF THE SCENE 🙄
2022🎭🎭🎭😎😎
Just watched it. Did not expect that lol. Crazy film and different
The whole movie is literally a porno don’t recommend watching
quando o trailer da o spoiler...
Having watched the movie and going back to this Trailer. They literally summarized the entire movie in 2 to 3 minutes. 😂🤣😅
Mia Goth girl, THE SERVE!
This company is becoming one of my favorites. They just make good movies. I loved X, it’s different but in a really good way.
The Last song this film?
hi
Great movie!
I don’t get it.
Home Depot
Who’s singing in this trailer?
3/10
xxxzv xxxr
this trailier is dog water
I like A24 films.
Where can I watch this movie ?
Worst movie of all time, holy shit wtf where they thinking 🤢
Cheap and one of the worst movies I've ever seen
Some great killings in this movie AWESOME!!!!!!!!
BEST Slasher of 2022
Just watched the entire film and it is the “slutty white girl’s “ version of Get Out. Brilliant!
She a movie star in my eyes😭
shit movie jenna was awesome tho
A24 It was the best horror movie ever!
Kid Buddi
fraco
W Jenna Ortega and kid cudi
One of the actors exactly look and talk like Jon 🦴 Jones😜😜😜😜
Loved this film and Maxine! (Also this is a genuinely entertaining trailer, great to see Ti West doing larger things)
Amazing
What's the title of the first song? Thanks
I was looking forward to seeing this movie, but was disappointed. The “old lady” looked super fake with poor makeup. The sex scene with the old folks was silly. I thought it would be a lot creepier/scary. It was more of a dark comedy.
For me personally, X is one of those films that in order to really appreciate you have to watch it in the cinema…and know nothing going in!
Dear A24, I can see that you paid a lot of people to leave comments on all your trailers mentioning the name of your company. Just to let you know that I’m open to collaboration too
Ight but how many sex scenes ima be skippin cuz I’m tryna watch this wit my sister n I that shit gon be awkward
Great video, very beautiful. I'm a big fan of you＋👍🔔
🤢🤢🤢🤢The movie is disgusting and I do not recommend watching it
Britney snow looks gorgeous 😻
Nobody gonna comment how our boy Kid Cudi is in this!?
This movie is stupid AF. Not scary.
What a hella of a good movie horror suspene movie  damn.... It's a slasher but there's also a story and the antagonists you understand why they kill .......one of the actresses was in Scream 5 but this movie is a 1000x better than Scream 5
I was surprised by Brittany Snow She is perfect for her role♥️
Dgffasd
I see A24 and instantly know it’s going to be amazing.
I loved this film!!
Gördüğüm en kötü film .
That looks bullshit and interesting at the same time.
It's a comedy film... poor plot...
Best movie I've possibly ever seen. Just perfect in everyway. Every scene makes you feel a certain type of fucking way.
That was refreshingly different and creepy AF!!! Loved it :)
Pff they didn’t let us  watch this movie so my friend and I got 2 tickets for Jurassic world and went to this movie. It was a waste of time. I only did that because my friend didn’t want to watch the dinosaurs and it was fun to run away from the staff but still, it was a waste of time. It’s not even scary. Literally. there isn’t a part where it surprises you. Sorry dinosaurs…
O la la
A24 makes so many good elevated horror films, along with Jordan Peele, but this company might be one of the best company’s to make horror
Ok but does this not remind you of the taking of Deborah Logan?
A killer grandma . Wow !
The ‘most replayed’ feature is exposing a lot of y’all 💀
Hey what was the song playing in the background of the trailer I need to know for something
No me gustó 😫😫😫
There should be a difference between a Horror movie and a Killing movie
Take 1 hour before something happening ... If you want see a movie with old people having sex and killing young people for no reason BE MY GUEST !
Little bits of history repeating themselves
Worst movie ever. I lose 1h46min19sec of my life.
This movie was excellent!
Soos
What a strange trailer..
sorry but they never made ir porn back in the 70s...
Jenna Ortega is amazing
This is a real sick movie
This movie gonna win for sure as the best comedy film of the era.
"La importancia de coger"  -La película
jenna ortega, mia goth and brittany snow and whoever acted as the grandma, i swear these women are the life of this film. really good movie!
such a goood fucking movie. didn’t get the chance to watch it in theaters but i bought it on Blu-ray and seen it twice already. the atmosphere of the movie, the acting, the soundtrack .. A24 never misses 😩😩❤️‍🔥
Dogshit movie.
this movie was pure comedy 🤣 😂
Below average just another low budget horror with gory stuff
This movie delivered more than I was expecting!  Well done… well done!!!!!  👍👍
What a stupid movie omg what happened to film making???
crazy super gory 80’s style horror flick 🎞 NO HOLD BARRED 👍🏽 👍🏽 👍🏽 👍🏽 👍🏽
FUNNY AF 😭 IT'S NOT HORROR OR THRILLER AT ALL
Don't waste time here😂 really.
That was interesting
Ti West + A24 = The match made in Heaven I didn't know I needed.
Mia Goth made the magic happen.  Red hair & freckles blasted us back to 79 for real.
80s movie 🙄  A24 rocks
This movie was better then I thought it was gonna be. Kinda reminds me of Texas chainsaw massacre and the cowboy reminds me of Matthew McConaughey. Good flick though, worth checking out!
Dissapoiting. Really dissapoiting movie.
The fact that Mia Goth plays both the old woman and the young rising adult film star in this blows my mind. She’s such an interesting and unique actress. Talented AF.
For a moment I thought the old man was Anthony Hopkins:0
This is honestly one of the best horror films I've seen in a WHILE, Ti West took it to another level with this one
This movie is goated. I loved Texas Chainsaw as a young teenager and this has got to be within the same aspect of creepy, spine chilling. I literally got so much anxiety during the scene when she crawled into bed with Maxine. Can’t wait for the prequel!!
A must see !!
That 70s Mono Scream is More than Horrifying. Good Job A24!!!
Garbage
Name of the song?
Dumb movie
This movie was extremely overrated. The plot was nothing special, it was predictable, and the makeup on the old woman and old man was awful. I knew right away it wasn’t actually two old actors, but rather young actors in old people makeup.  But my biggest complaint is how dark it was. I own a Samsung OLED but this movie was freaking dark…I couldn’t see half of what was going on most of the time because there was basically zero lighting. Maybe they did that to hide the really bad old people makeup?  Also, it wasn’t clever…Maxine barely escapes getting eaten by an alligator at the beginning of the movie was clearly foreshadowing her narrow escape at the end. SNOOZE!
OMG I never noticed the eye pop foreshadowing
is this a horror?
Gem of a movie. Has a great feel.
this movie was horrible!
Very strange movie...different
This movie was great !!
Looks absolutely dumb af
Thumbnail cringe
The film sucked
It costs 20 dollars to rent on Amazon, wtf is that. It cost 20 dollars to buy, that makes alot of sense.
X
After masterpieces like Hereditary, the Witch and Saint Maud, this movie was a complete waste of time.  Shallow plot, dumb script, predictable AF and redundant. IDK how this even qualifies as horror. It's just a slasher/gore movie.. The only great thing was the editing and art direction.
ghf
Want to watch it but I feel like I seen that old lady in another movie that was a exorcism on her and she was like a snake type of creature, am I crazy?
I'm glad I saw the movie before seeing this trailer. Many of the things I never saw coming in the film and was shocked by are just in the trailer
This is a gooooooooooooood movie. Wow
I swear to god its easier and easier to kill people in horror movies, I wonder whats next, maybe killer todlers who can't even walk yet. Maybe I'm just weird but I get more chills from listening people read scary stories here on youtube.
Farmers daughter take 1😳
Checking this out now 🤫
Really don’t want to see more black on white. Its way over played out. It’s getting so sickening to see white girls on black guys.
Now I know how one alphabetical word can catch millions of views...
now that's a great f**king trailer right there. gonna watch this tonight over pizza and beer, perfect.
🤣 This film was crazy.
That white woman could pass for a corn star
Anyone know the song?
yes this is one fucked up horror picture
ไทยแรยนนน
lame
All the positive comments about this crappy flick were probably written by the filmmakers' relatives.  This piece of sh*t is loaded with cliches from every 70's/80's/90's etc slasher movie where the socalled black dude gets  gorily done in before everyone else. And the last chick standing or running and screaming is a socalled white chick. How is that original.  Throw this garbage flick under the garbage. NEXT
Ça va me faire plaisir de revoir Brittany Snow  après Bushwick.  Production A24 en plus. Ça s'annonce intéressant
This should've been titled...The Grannies. Lol.
The visit..
1/10
What’s the 70s vibe song? Anyone know?
A pervy old lady? Yea pass.
This was 5/10 at best. Horror movie with porn stars. Nothing intriguing.
Szkoda czasu film za darmo na cda
oh man this movie is great. I've just seen it and would like to recommend it. It's filmed as if its 80's movie, the characters are great, the setting. There's some sort of mindfuck going on with they way they portray sex, i didn't try to analyse it but its there. all in all simple story but very good execution. you wont be disappointed
really glad to see the reviews on here so positive...this trailer looks really fresh. Might have to check this out.
Absolutely amazing movie This is pure cinema and I freaking mean it just watched it last night
I'm honestly just disappointed words can't even express how disappointed I am
Brittany! 😅
can someone let me know the song used in this trailer?
I'm simple man when I see A24 I watch it
Je vais le voir tout à l'heure 👍
Jennie's got taste
Ya la pasaron en cine??
Looks like an old fashioned kind of horror film...You know the ones....those movies that scared the bejesus out of ya.
LOVEEDDDD this movie
Just watch film . Its a mad film
What the ever loving ...... Okay, I give up ....
Wow! This looks like worth watching!
kinda like tcm
Kid cudi
It wasn't scary at all 2 old people killing people 20 years younger than them lol idk how
does anybody know the name of the song?
Best thing about this movie is the sex scenes and the message that every girl is a bitch inside
It's worth a watch I'd give it a 5 /10.
i cant put into words how ecstatic i am that this film looks like it was filmed with an 80s camera, i love film grain so much...
Wow, I'm so glad I didn't watch this trailer before seeing the movie!
Fantastic movie!!!!!!! 👌👌👌
VERY GOOD MOVIE COMPANY, I RECOMMEND
This kinda looks like a mashup of Chainsaw Massacre/Boogie Nights/Almost Famous
Very mediocre horror film... a waste of time.
I’m watching X right now. Crazy!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Great film, terrible trailer what the hell? I´m glad I´ve watched the film before the trailer... It spoils everything!
This movie is so terribly bad!
Crazy good movie ^^
Too much porn i think. Sorry
This film was all style over substance which failed on every level due to severe plot holes and lack of what you could call a storyline. The whole film seemed to be a homage to Tobe Hooper that once you got past the Grind House period piece feel to it there wasn't much else beneath the surface other than an improbable mess of a film!  At least with an Ari Aster film he researches the subject matter and comes up with a good story that has a twist where X just fails miserably.  X goes into great detail in it's costumes, sets, sound track, and even down to the cans of beer in the 70's but that is where it ends. After the initial good start it seems the director hasn't thought about it too much and cobbled together a ridiculous after thought non event story of what appears to be pensioner jealousy gone bad. We also have to mention the fact that the two antagonists of the piece are three days older than grass and wouldn't be capable of carrying out the atrocities seen on the screen.  I would say to people, don't bother as it is 1 hour 46 minutes of your life you are not going to get back!
Everyone talked trash bout this flick I actually thought it was well done and good I love it
great movie!
As I watched this movie, all I could think of was how much better it would be with Matthew McConnaughey
WOw looks pretty bad
Please name a this film. Please 😢
Puta mierda de peli os lo digo en serio
This movie teach me two important lessons. First off enjoy your life bc one day you'll get old, second off Don't trust any women they all bitches. Poor RJ
Puff no me gustó nada
This movie was SO fucking stupid, save your money.
Wtf last night I had a dream just like this and my mum told me there's a movie like that on the cinema. But I didn't know it at all.
Watching now the movie is actually good. Just didn’t want to see it in theater because of too much gore and sex that’s why I waited. Watching porn movies in theaters makes me uncomfortable.
Guys this is a horrible movie. Do not waste your time for this garbage.
It isn't even a horror movie, it's more like a comedy about how getting old is gross and fucked up
*WASTE OF TIME*
every horror fan should watch this film
Song???
A24 you need to stop this fetish with naked old people... I'm already scared a lot
Anyone knows what sound track it is?
When is this released on blu-ray?
I didnt watch it yet but someone tell me was this flm based on true story?
This looks so boring
Is the Black Man the first to get whacked
Yo what's the song.
Just Sick with all these cannibalism shit 😑
Vaya mierda de película, está echa para monstruos, asco de película me dio tanto ASCO  que vomité
Granny Slasher
Ax
god such an amazing movie, a24 really doesn’t miss.
Ultra sensacional and disgusting 😜
Ви в Х-фактор!
Driving out sin with sin
Hades awaits you oh wicked one!
A24 ... say no more.
Fucking piece of shit movie, nx wasted my 2 hours of my life , that i will never get back. Very trash movie, trailer is very decieving, dont fool yourself.
Dumb me didn't even know that the old lady and Maxine is played by the same actress until I searched the cast lol. I like the part with Martin Henderson in the barn (I watched him in Grey's Anatomy). 😋
Here we go again.... more force fed black guy/white girl crap....
Mia Goth is mesmerizing
Nope
name of the song?
Worst movie ever
2:09 she looks like Charlize Theron in Monster. Not a very nice thing to say 😆
When 👀
Will be amazing
This was hands down the stupidest movie I have ever seen in my life.
What's the song?
I liked it. Writing and acting was great.
Não queria entender o nome desse filme🤢🤢🤢🤢
this movie really knows how to destroy a boner for a week🤣
Recoil…….. ‘’That’s what I call divine intervention’’ Had a good chuckle on that one. Watta movie. 10/10. 5 super jumbo stars. This movie makes Anabelle take a dump on herself.
a24
Girl I've seen this film in Hoyts Docklands
CUDI 😍😍😍
This movie was fuckin’ amazing
"and the studio that brought you HEREDITARY" and then this movie got my interest 💗
song name?
Cudi to the moon 🌚🙌🙌🙌
Looks like a stupid dog shit movie like everything else has been lately tbh.
Bad movie and nothing groundbreaking.
Seriuosly i love all Mia Goth performances, she has this eerie aura that attracts me in every movie she's in, 9/10 this film, it has blood, creepy, bizarre and funny elements in it, worth watching
What's the song in the trailer?
Is that Kid Cudi?
Y’all this movie is so damn entertaining…..and I don’t mean in a cheesy way. It’s genuinely good.
Is no-one talking 'bout Brittany Snow changing up gears?
Trash
How to c
Song name?
Damn good movie I say, damn good.
It’s the worst movie I have watched in years. Maybe the worst
wow
even if you at least give a shit about your life
dont watch this if you love your life
2hrs of my life wasted and wont come fking back
scam
i give 10 out of 1000 to this movie
if you dont have any other thing to do in your life  dont watch this movie at all
this movie was a waste of time
Good stuff! I thought it's gonna be a Rob Zombie film at first :D
I was thinking the other day it has been a long time since I saw a good horror movie and this ticked all of the boxes. But what got me the most is finding a really interesting fact about one of the characters THAT just wowed me.
I don't think so not my cup of tea and it looks boring and i can tell that the story line is bad right from the jump.
Shaz bro ടെ ott movie's review കണ്ടിട്ട് വന്നവരൊണ്ടോ🤣🤣🤣
Who else want extended and FULL version of this movie?
I'm so glad I didn't watch the trailer  I like it ,very disturbing gross asf
I laughed at the part ,when the old woman try to kill the girl using the gun and then she blow away hahahaha Ur too old grandma hahhaa
another dogshit fucking ugly movie disgusting backround trash next movie rating go next gl hf
Turned into a snuff film
black guy dies first, i bet ya
That scream though!! SO good
Wrong turn 10...
So the company releases two movies titled X and MEN. Someone's having fun. :)
Betamax
can i ask you guys: is it true that the old woman if she fell by herself after shooting, was it bounced back so she fell, I still don't understand that detail.
This movie so gory i wanted barf so much  that basement scene i can’t get the image out my head
Kid cudi
my new favourite film!
This movie was awesome.... scary and hilarious at the same time👍😬
Looks like a Texas Chainsaw Massacre rip-off at first and then a little like a Devil's rejects ( rip off of a rip off of texas chainsaw massacre), and then a bunch of confusion.  What is the old lady supposed to be?  After Lamb, I am skeptical of any A24 horror trailers.  Lamb is not a horror movie but they sold it like one, so I don't trust them anymore.  Hereditary was great though.
Explotation porn meets I piss on your grave with a mix of Last house on the left and bloody gore TCM. I Like it 👍!
Can anyone help me to find this trailer music? Please.
its good
is there a release date?
The movie was freaking amazing!!!!
WTF did I just watch
did they use real cow for that first scene?
This movie was damn good!
Wow I wish this movie get Oscar 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Crazy A/F lol but it was good....😂
Whats the song ?
good movie, it pissed me off at some moments but it was entertaining overall. also i loved the old school vibe. maxine best character btw.
This movie was a hell of a ride! (You see what I did there?)
Who tf A24 i dont care wtf you are
Anybody else thought this was a damn x men film?
Gives me leatherface vibes
This reminds me of the granny game on play store
X (2022)   CAST  Main Role  • Mia Goth as Maxine Minx / Pearl  Support Role  • Brittany Snow as Bobby Lynne • Scott 'Kid Cudi' Mescudi as Jackson Hole • Jenna Ortega as Lorraine Day • Martin Henderson as Wayne Gilroy  • Owen Campbell as RJ Nichols • Stephen Ure as Howard • James Gaylyn as Sheriff Dentler  • Simon Prast as Televangelist
no man, your eyes gonna pop out
That was the funniest shit ever!
I am still pissed that Jenna Ortega axed the right side of the door instead of the left that she had to "struggle" reaching for the lock on the right side. 😂😂😂
That DUMBK beach Lorraine's death WAS the Most beautiful and Satisfying death EVER. ❤️❤️❤️
1:36 Lol i missed this foreshadowing
Just watched it and let me tell ya something!!!! Definitely a great movie to watch so make sure it's on ur to do list 😉
The old lady that’s killing in this movie is how modern women nowadays are going to be when they get older when no dudes wanna give them attention of dick anymore ahahaha lol 😂.
Martin Henderson 😍🤩😍🤩
any movie w jenna ortega I'm gonna watch it
Shitt this is movie porno not horror i hate this
Good trailer
Don’t listen to the comments watch it for yourself one of the best horror movies I seen in a while
Great, I have to hear Jenny Ortega scream for the next hour. Fml.
Another movie with that box officer killer Jenny Ortega. I'll pass on this one.
This looks good, I thought it’d be dumb
The Hills Run Red meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I love it!❤️
Did anyone else hear Tara’s scream from scream 5?
What a movie it was !!! My new favorite.
This movie it’s for children 💩
Okay. I get it. You've got these young, beautiful pornstars juxtaposed to someone so ravaged with age and illness they are literally monstrous. Metaphor for fear of aging, decrepitude, the end of being sexual and desirable, the end of beauty and likely the horror of dementia, alzheimer"s in general etc. We don't realize the horror of these things until they happen to us, at which point they become terrifying for many people and yet on paper they don't seem as bad as running from a monster or a killer. So it has to be actualized this way for us to understand. I'm excited to watch.
This movie was mad weird
This movie is more horrible than the new Texas Chainsaw movie
SOMETHING IN THE WAY!!!!
DONE WATCHING THIS, I RATE THIS 9/10 !! THIS IS A MUCH WATCH!!!! GREAT STORYLINE, GREAT ACTING!!!!
A fucking great movie!!!! Especially when 420ing... 10/10
The main chick looks like Charlize Theron in Monster.
I like the matthew mcconaughey lookalike guy
A24 + Ti West = 👍 Interesting motive for the killer.  Mia Goth plays both roles.  I really loved Ti West's, you're next.  I think its underrated while this may have been slightly overrated but still pretty good.
I watched this last night. So good!! Congratulations!
Old School vibes... take my money !!!
I love how the song was used in this trailer it was so good that I looked up the song and it just wasn’t as good
A24 best movies EVER!!
Anything by A24 you got me Simple!
2:15 did they just re-use the same scream that Jenna Ortega did in the new scream movie or did they just said “eh fine, we’ll re use the same scream from Jenna Ortega from the new scream”
OK  smbh
😂😂😂😂🕵😂😂😂 watching the full movie.......oh my
S so x Y  N V m NBC c  b asI  km NBC bj  aww ffifck CD
I saw this movie in its entirety ... it was not an interesting movie.
This is the weirdest film I've seen this year thus far. It wasn't scary or jumpy. It was just weird.
Oh my god i just realised. They put all the character deaths that happend in the movie in the trailer. And we didnt notice.
It's a early rob zombie movie
Yawn. A24 have officially run out of ideas.
Crazy seeing Kid Cudi in here
It is a good movie.
This is the last time I listen to the comment section. This movie was SOOOOOO boring OMG.
This is by far one of the best horror movies I’ve ever seen. Storyline violence and gore are so well put together in this film
Why everyone praises that Jenna Ortega¿?, forgettable like his role in Scream. Mia Goth is the real sweet deal here! Lovely movie.
ALL A24 films & Soundtracks are heavily-lifted from 70's horror films, but this one doesn't even try to hide it.  Some millennial film goers are too removed from the past to recognize it, and the other millennials aren't inventive or imaginative enough to do their own schtick so they steal it and screen it for $$$... Guess they deserve each other.
This could be a porn movie on some sadomazochist site for weird freak Audience.
A24 is unreal they are the best everything they do Hereditary, Lamb, Good Time, The Lighthouse, The Witch, Skin, Val, Midsummer, Lady bird, Highlife, Uncut Gems and dude sooo many more every movie in my top 10 lists in the last 4 years has been put out by A24...Literally watch these movies if you haven't each one is freaking fantastic
Just saw it. Garbagio
This was one f'ed up horror picture. I loved it
Boring and stupid AF.. More. Like comedy
this is the most uninspired, vapid, cliche flick A24 has made.
Overrated
A bit of porn and horror my two favorite movie genres, can't wait to see this.
this movie had no business being THAT good holy shit
Meu hype tá nas alturas pqp 👌🇧🇷
Well thank God porno isn't this boring!🤦‍♂️ The Matthew McConaughey wanna be, I thought was hilarious🤣 Couldn't get past the 1st 15 minutes 😡Script written by kindergarteners👶 paid with milk and cookies🍪🥛
Not a bad movie, decent plot and good acting. Highly recommended!
dumbness on the highest level
This is a negative commnet.
what is the name of background music
God bless A24
God bless a24
i love this movie
Is it good? Looks like Texas chain massacre
Is that kid cudi ?
Was surprisingly really good. Very dark scenes made it hard to see but that was part of the affect. I recommend for sure
Looks great
That was heart attack inducing
I wonder why the credits dont list Joe Biden.    He played both of the old people roles in the movie, right?
I've just watched it. I was avoiding every tweet, every article, anything related to this movie, including this trailer. I didn't want to have big expectations and get frustrated in the end. But then I hit the play button and in the first scene I was already hyped up.  It's a Texas Chainsaw Massacre with the A24's tradicional fucketry twist, adding some Psycho and even The Shining spices. I love it. It really feels like it's from the 70s, the cast, the photography, everything. (off: the blond girl looks like Carmella Soprano)
This movie was so ridiculously satisfying. It’s such a fun call back to the days of grindhouse and 70s slasher films.
Some of you must be new to production companies. Lionheart films was the shit when they first came out too and then they started putting out trash after they blew up.
Damn good movie!!!
This is the most fucked up movie I’ve ever seen!
This was filmed in NZ 😍😍
A24 THANK YOU!!!!! Keep the movies coming, can't wait
I never watch a trailer to the end. The first 30 seconds are more than enough for me to decide if I'm going to watch something. If you do the same as me, be aware; this is one fucked up movie.
Documentaries realized there never ammunition forms of the trust of true Powersport of Gods Magic symbol of both handed nickel’s judge’s orders formatting presidential colleges dwindling expenditure cinema yeah yeah yeah I’m higher than a motherfokteller
Kilnoumdoum
I'm here for Chelsea Wolfe
The guy who made this trailer gave the movie a completely different than it actually is.  Great trailer.  Crappy story.  Good actors though.
This movie is for 18+ only
Top 🍿🍿🍿🍿
It was good!!!
Is that James Gaylyn as one of the cops? Power Rangers fans rejoice in praising this dude for getting work his way! And for saying "one god-damned fucked up horror movie"
So a texas chainsaw massacre rip off?
Watching as of rn
This wasnt a bad flick at all. Horror always winning over interracial porn. Very pretty cast, but wouldve switched girls death at the end, even though there wasnt a single character to like in this movie.
Obsessed with this movie! Seen it twice so far!!
Saw it the day it was released! Absolutely the BEST movie I’ve seen in years. Highly recommended
"Set in 1979, adult movie actors and a small film crew arrive to a farmhouse occupied by an elderly couple in the desolate Texas countryside to film an adult movie. "  You serious? Who greenlighted this plot? I mean, I get how California passed out $600 Golden State Stimulus check, but couldn't people find better things to do with that cash instead of making these cheezy films?
Glad I didn't see this trailer before seeing the movie. It spoils the majority of the movie.
Sorry.. But it's just too weird for me...
I’ve seen the movie, yet i cannot stop watching this trailer. The editing, combined w foghat broken up in such a genius way, to relive the vibe of this film, plus that scream at the end is all time
Yes!!!! What a horror should be!! And it’s 1979 again good music!! Well done Granny , can anyone see this 😉
wtf is that shitty movie?!!!
garbage waste of time
fun hagsploitation circa 1979, sort of, with a scary nympho lesbian, to keep things woke, twist! May not be in theaters in Florida, still Anita Bryant country... speaking of hags.
I loved this a lot 10/10 🤠🤠🤠
pessimo, house 1000 corps
Worst movie from a 24
amazing horror movie . well done .great job
Sex n horror movie what could go wrong lol
I'm not a fan of the deliberate graininess added to the colour grading. There's a reason we keep improving picture quality. This is not artistic. This is so backward!!
Yeah cudi!!!!
Big fan of A24 movies, but sadly this was A crap movie...
I laughed out loud at the ending when the cops found the camera and wonder what's inside😂😂😂
Saw it just now! MY NEW FAVORITE HORROR MOVIE AS OF THE MOMENT! KUDOS TO A24
A24 makes the weirdest shit
It's giving me texas chainsaw massacre vibe 😂😂😂😂😂
Looks shit from the trailer, is it worth watching?
This is probably one of the funniest slasher film I've watched. I don't know if the director intentionally did it but some scene that are supposed to be scary cracked me up 😆. That shotgun scene at the end was so epic.
That is one sick fucked up movie
make sure yall doors and windows shut 😄😄
song name?
A24 makes the lamest of arthouse 'horror'. Glad to see that hasn't changed.
Hmm, the 70's teens in Texas, in a van, pull up to an old white house with a creepy old dude,.. why do I feel like I've seen this exact movie before... involving chainsaws.
The trailer spoils everything lmao
a24 silently dropping gems
Okay the most disturbing scene is the elders s3x scene. O my holy crap kind of sad with their conversation but later wanna throw up lol.
I have alrdy downloaded this movie
A+.
I thought this movie was hilarious and clever. Seems to be a commentary on sex and aging. I won't say more for fear of spoiling.
The most twisted movie I've ever seen.
Just finished Watchin this and I must say it was good af
Love A24, and another great film production... But Jeezuz, WTFuuuuuuuck. I feel like I need a shower and then a serious comedy!
I am clearly gonna watching this for plot. nothing else. not the sex, just the plot.
This is one weird ass horror picture.
Mathew mconahey impersonator
My wife is not well
Looks fabulous 🤩
1:02 is this the guy who fucked up everybody in Evil Dead :D
What is the song in this trailer XD
This movie is insane in all the right ways. Highly recommend.
Always excited when a24 drops something...really looking forward to ari asters next masterpiece though
What’s the song? Like the version in the trailer
If the GRANDPARENTS FROM TeXas chainsaw was a SPINoff storyline.     This would Seem inarguably similar
I just love Jenna Ortega
This actually looks promising
damn, the entire movie was in the trailer, literally.
There is no story here. The issue is it's a hodgepodge of so many other films which came before it such as Texas Chainsaw, Eaten Alive, Taking of Deborah Logan and the Visit all of whom did it better. The critics will love it as TI WEST is their darling but it's reductive at it's best.
It looks interesting but I'm a little disappointed because I thought it was gonna be a story about, like, the first porno every made which I thought would be cool but then it became a horror film 😅
Boogie nights meets The Visit?
The best movie in 2022, Mia Goth oh la la ^^
Big disappointed
One of the worst movies in history.
You should see the prequel: Malcolm X.
11/10 movie
Mia Goth is EXCELLENT in three roles,  just finished watching X
Reminds me of Texas chainsaw massacre
Is it good.... Meh. It's directed and edited incredibly well. TI WEST is such a good director. What lacks is the story. More a love letter to so many cinematic offerings that came before than an original piece. It calls to The Taking of Deborah Logan, Eaten Alive, The Visit, and specifically the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Evil Deal. It's as if they plucked elements from those films and laid them into this one. It is incredibly entertaining but not memorable or original in the least. Just rent the aforementioned and you can see for yourself.
Qual e nome dessa música no trailer
Is there any german cinema which show‘s this movie?
I love 70s stuff .
Mia Goth somewhat resembles a young Shelley Duvall in this movie, I want to see this at some point
This movie is full of references from other horror movies, it's like watching the cheap copy of '74 Texas Massacre  There is no originality and full of clichés
Looks dumb like all the other crap recycled horror of the past 30 years. Junk.
I can’t wait until the prequel comes out!
The montage to the song Landslide was amazing. All in all the Film was only meeeeh for me.
when is this movie gonna be streaming online.? i cant waait
Damn this trailer really spoiled everything 😂
Ray..🎥👍
i love movie
Was so wicked. Loved it. Groovy hell.
Last shot of the trailer is the last shot of the movie smh
Yy
I was just curious if this movie is worth seeing?
Watched the movie today. So glad I didn't watch this trailer. So much better going in blind
This film was amazing.
Love Mia Goth. An incredible actress without fear that can play any role in any genre.
Watching this trailer made me think it was gonna be trash, but got dragged to watch it and absolutely loved it.
This movie was so wtaf
mia goth is so hot its crazy
Great movie 🍿
goth star
Dude Jenna Ortega my age bro and y’all put her in a film like this, she’s still young & its just extremely disturbing
I don`t know this looks awful but comments seems to like it
Brittany Snow was incredible
Was a pretty good movie I definitely recommend
this trailer sucks
does anyone know the names of the song?
one of the best films of the year so far and maybe one of the best slashers in a long time. it's an old school slasher that goes back to basics and does it very well. i'm excited for the prequel.
Go see it. Was well worth it
Looks atrociously sexist
Cringe AF, stupid music and stupid signalling. This isn't horror.
Eh….old woman aren’t scary…maybe because I work with old people in psychiatric hospitals.
What song is that?
This looks epic!
Kid Cudi looks like Black Dynamite in this movie.
Modern horror is a joke. Early 2000 had the best horror movies, I miss it and I don’t even know why I try with recent horror anymore. They’re all cheap and predictable
Soo boring. Not scary at all
This is actually a great films. Perfect mix of comedy and horror.
Umm prono in past is bush wack! Gross!
If you watched this movie, did you stay until the end of the credits? Something was added at the very end.  Saw this in a movie theater. I always wait until credits are over.
ok - I am NOT into horror or slasher stuff like this, but DANG - that is one AWESOME BRILLIANTLY PUT TOGETHER TRAILER!!! YEESH SO GOOD! lol
Everytime I see this trailer I think kid cudi is russel hornsby lol
People act as if this movie is horrible but I don't get it, It was funny the characters were great and the villains were set up great too also the setting and kills were fantastic.
Looks like it is trying really really hard. I got bored from the trailer
This movie is perfect. Thank you for your work a+
Horrible movie
A24 rules the modern horror genre
A movie about Elon's kid going through life with that name. Great.
So 70s found footage?
Had potential but overall shallow movie 🎥 why didn't you showed Cudi's death? That was weird.
This movie mid ash💀
This movie was fantastic, gives me Texas chainsaw massacre vibes
X is the name ?
These paid comments are hilarious
looks wack
Looks mid
Oh to have been a p☆rn st☆r in the 70's ❤️‍🔥🥺
I haven't seen any tv commercials for this movie but it is played in the movie theaters. Shame. As soon as the trailer said Hereditary, I stopped the trailer because I know that I will like this movie because I loved Hereditary. I don't want to see any possible spoilers.
Saw it last night I must say it was a good movie a must see make u look at old ppl different now lol
I absolutely adore the style. It's not just set in the 70s, it FEELS like a 70s horror movie. Also, I've been loving Ortega's performances in horror lately, looks like we might have a new scream queen around, would Jenna Ortega be the next Jamie Lee Curtis?
Porno horror. Umm, yeah. I really do think the world is gonna end soon lol.
Yes please!
x as in cross this film out.  no. mia g, you're better than this.
If you're yet to see it, get ready for the most unsettling and bizarre movie that's come out in awhile.
Easily one of my favorite movies of all time. The critics are right.
This movie was wild lol. Definitely wasn't what I expected. A fun take on a slasher.
This movie was actually very good and had some iconic scenes
A24 is my favorite art
Cant wait!
Where can I find this movie at please
Quite possibly the most unoriginal PoS ever put to celluloid. They're not even trying anymore. Mash together every movie you've ever seen and throw the same predictable jump scares in there. Like the cast but no thanks.
They had a 1980's Chrysler M Body cop car...faaaake
Does anyone know where I can watch this movie for free? In HD?
An original horror movie! Thank satan!!! No more remake reimagining prequel sequel requels!!
that music is just sick! anyone know the name?!
This was incredible.
I liked watching this movie 🎥 8/10 for me 😊
What’s the concept of this movie?
Saw it last night.
I got y’all 1:03
Do NOT see this movie 10 people walked out of the theater including me. Trust me don’t even waste your money
This movie sucked 😞
I actually love the movie . Every moment is interesting and the peaks are captivating. I think TI did well with this film ! Got to love Brittney Snow. Jenna doing her thing in Scream & now this ? She was working really hard and it paid off . It’s a must see!
this reminds me of bloody crayons (2017) a filipino slasher film, A seemingly tight-knit group of college friends goes to an island to shoot a horror short film. But their world turns upside down when one of them gets killed after playing the Bloody Crayons Game.
Just saw this movie yesterday, its kinda oke not that big of a hype 6/10
Just watched it this shit is weiiirdd
I love A24 movies but I’m kinda scared to go watch this alone because no one else will want to 😂
Hm… watched it last nigh… horror movie… some images are hard to get out of my brain … job well done, filmmakers
Does anyone know the name of the music playing in the background?
I’m getting real Texas Chainsaw Massacre vibes.
Iunno man. Seen this yesterday cause of the great reviews. Was definitely highly entertaining but I don’t think it’s as good as everyone making out to be. I’d say definitely watch it but easily one Id wait for to come out and watch at home.
this movie was so fucking strange but so fucking good
Very disappointing movie but a tab fun if high
looks kind of gay
A24 does a great job at showing you just a hint of what the movie is about I feel like with most other trailers I watch always spoil it or I am easily able to guess what’ll happen
Cliche, only a little bit creepy, and tacky jumpscares. BORING! I expected better from A24, but then again, The Green Knight was trash so I don't have high expectations anymore
Dude it was so great. The trailer spoils a lot though, including the glorious final line. Glad I didn’t watch this beforehand.
I just saw this. Very well done! I’ve seen a lot of slashers but this still managed to be suspenseful. An effective mix of erotic and horrifying.
This looks so good bro
I enjoyed it. Good movie
Guilty im here for Kid Cudi
I didn't think I would like this, but I stand corrected. It looks like it may be good!
Just got done watching it … damn it’s fkn amazing
Is there a lot of sex in this movie or is it just kind of assumed? Like bumpin & grinding or whatever.
Daaaaaamn kid cudi could play jimmi Hendrix that’s crazy.
Loved this movie! It was good. Slow burn but pay off was great.
pass
i legally have the rights to the letter x so....kaching kaching
Hey, y'all forgot to put Kid Cudi in the cast credits!
First time I went to the movies since 2018 to see this and it was definitely a good choice, absolute ripper of a film.
This, quite literally, might be one of the worst movies that has ever came out. Ever. By the grace of God, this movie has a 95% on Rotten Tomatoes. I’m assuming that 95/100 Rotten Tomatoes critics are cucks. I have no idea why everyone thinks this movie is great, this is one of the cheesiest, weakest, and most unnecessarily sexual movies ever. The acting was terrible, the kills were so boring, and there were no creepy elements at all, only bad timed jump scares you saw coming from miles away. The reason why this movie was made, was to have a short shelf life in theatres, and hit Netflix, where all the 14yr old kids are gonna watch it when they get their phone taken away. If you truly enjoyed this movie, you might have mommy,daddy problems, and maybe it’s time to take up a new hobby.  P.S. I don’t care if you went to cinematic school, there are no interesting angles, no interesting flavors, nothing that I haven’t seen before a million times. Not artistic. There’s no “unique culture” I’m missing, this movie is very bad.
Watching it tn 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
does anybody know the song
Very similar to that old film Axe
Definitely a dicked up movie.
I wanna go see it haven’t yet
life and death of a porno gang remake?
What name the movie?
Movie sucks
Didn’t know sex could be so damn disturbing like damn they destroying everything for me
This shit is weird I feel weird watching it and then I go to the comments and it’s nothing but praise
10/10 Kid cudi cucked a white mans girlfriend.
Just One Person's Seventeen Second Review: (Give or Take):     But Was.. "Pleasantly", Solidly, Decently Surprised by This .! Could it have been Better ,? ~ YES --- ARE There Better, More Solid, Jacked Films Out there of Approximately (the) Same Dimensions ,? --- *YES* ~ (Revenge. And the Survivalist, for example) _ But. (imho at least); Madam Mia Goth was FANTASTIC, On-Point, Alert, SASSY, GORGEOUS, and BEAUTIFUL In This Flick. 🎨👙👙👙 Carrying Most (if not the Entirety) of the script and story upon Her Pretty Shoulders. 🎨👙🎨🎨  (No Dissrespect is meant To(ward) the Other Artists either in saying that.)
😯😯😯😯
I don't really like horror movies but I need to watch this one lol
Soooooo good! I had the theatre to myself and I was scared the rest of the night 😂
This film blew me away. The twists and turns were genuinely disturbing and shocking…
Not sure what all you see , but this movie sucked !
Normally I hate A24 because the artsy fartsy camera work and the slowly driven to madness plot is so overdone and not original at all just like the jump scares you see on the nun. That’s right I put A24 on the same shit teir list as any of James Wans recent movies. But with that aside this movie actually looks good and promising. It better be because if it’s another letdown like the lighthouse then horror is officially dead...
Rated G.  For Great!!!
This movie was so f*cked up, they used one of the MOST AMAZING & BEAUTIFUL songs ever—AND they did it beautifully! That’s how messed up the movie was. IT’S AWESOME, I loved it!
This movie was 🗑
Glad I didn't watch this trailer before the movie cause damn they show literally everything but the final confrontation it seems.
Filme de gente doente . Por isso o mundo está desse jeito de mal a pior .
Ti West getting the mainstream love he deserves. Hes the absolute best in the horror genre right now.
A-24..... it's gotta be good.
Amazing movie
The 70s vibe with hair/makeup/costumes was perfect! 👌🏿 Most period films try to capture it, but fail.
Mia goth playing Maxine and the older woman Pearl, iconic.
Old lady giving me witch vives for some reason.
After watching this movie, I think I hate sex 🤣🤣
This looks awesome!!
I didn't like it but I didn't hate it,  it's weird and i'm probably going to watch it again
what is the music in the trailer?
Saw this movie last night really good 👍
INTERESTING!
"Gonna give it to ya"
Love this movieeee
This is a really good movie
Film even looks like its from the 70s
En tant que français qui vient de voir ce film, je le trouve très médiocre tant dans la réalisation que dans l’écriture de l’histoire !  On ressent un manque de budget et d’envie dans ce film je recommande pas du tout il est très malsain …
ever wanted proof modern trailers suck watch this
I loved Johnny Winter as the old man
Texas AARP Massacre  I loved and hated X
WITF?! 😳
that was absolutely horrific and i’m genuinely scarred. so triggering omfggg
I loved this movie! Caught my attention because Jenna is one heck of a rising star, but also A24 makes movies I absolutely love! This was the first time I went to the movies since 2019 and it was fantastic! Absolutely worth it!
Que música é essa que toca??
🍿Great movie 🎥
A.k.a. : *Texas Porn Massacre*
Did not like this movie
That’s trailers great but goddamn it ruined everything in the film hahahaha
Can we PLEASE get more horror films in this style?
This movie was amazing
Can we stop with the pcbs at all levels of entertainment, please...ffs?
JENNA ORTEGA THE 2022 SCREAM QUEEN LOVE HER
This looks so good I'm afraid to watch it because I won't get another first time seeing it.
There wasn't even any 70s bush in this movie
Does anyone know the name of the song used in the first half of this trailer?
Dang this is a pretty spoilery trailer for A24.  I think I’d have been surprised more had I not seen it!  A24 trailers are usually edited in a way as to not reveal much so that’s disappointing!
This look hard asf
What’s the song called
Anyone know the song???
0:27 WHAT IS WITH HER BROWS!! SHE HAS SCARS!!!!
Does anyone know the name of the song?
Interessante q pelo trailer vc não dá NADA pro filme né?? Kkkk parece + do mesmo... Mas a crítica tá ovacionando!! Espero q chegue logo no Brasil!!
Ti & A24, yes please
A24 lowkey becoming the goat and no one even knows yet
i see a lot of people loving the movie, how sexual is it? like is it super explicit? i’m only asking because i try NOT to watch stuff like that. plssss answer, i love horror movies
A24 is a new solid studio. Too bad you hated it.
I don't know why this gives me slight Texas Chainsaw Massacre vibes. People in a van/vehicle arrive at a weird house in the middle of nowhere, and the land owners are creepy as hell. This looks great!! Hope to see it soon
Satan worshiper old people terrorizing some full grown az men? 🤔  I would just whopp their az 🤣
A24 always amazes me with their films and that doesn’t change with X. This looks PERFECT. ❤️
The (00ning of a black man is always profitable 😒
This movie is SOO good I watched it yesterday and wow I haven’t liked a movie this much since forever
The theater went insane during that third act. It was a very good movie & dare I say, a new classic!
This is giving me Texas chainsaw massacre vibes that’s why I’m goin to see it Tuesday
The trailer looks like the original Texas chainsaw massacre.
This movie was hilarious 🤣🤣
Watched the movie without watching the trailer first and man I was in for a treat not knowing who the killer was!  Came back to the trailer and it’s still great!
nothing scarier than a crazy old lady
Filmed in a perfect and unique way !!
GREAT MOVIE !!!!👍🏻 JUST WATCHED AND WORRTH IT WHAT A TRIP !
I watched this today and loved it!!!!!
This movie sucked.
What’s the song the old lady danced to?
One of the most bizzarre movies I’ve ever seen in my life… I loved it!
Just got back from watching this, and the only thing I’m gonna say is, if you are a fan of the old school slasher. Then this is what you have been waiting for for decades
this trailer is lit🔥🔥🔥
i watched it its pretty good
What's the name of the song?
I realy love this movie
Seen it today with a group and everybody thought it sucked Personally i didn't liked it that much either
This movie was absolutely messed up! It made me cringe all over.
This was an AWESOME horror movie. Better than hereditary, genuinely disturbing in all the right ways. Loved it.
I may be asexual but i still enjoyed this a lot. Not a lot of horror films scare me as much as games but this terrified me. 10/10 job
movie sucks ass 🤣🙅🏽‍♀️🙅🏽‍♀️
HORROR FANS: Would you make friends with a fellow horror fan who happens to be gay?
This reminds me of Texas chainsaw massacre
Absolutely trash, I seen it. It's a waste of time and money, it's cheesy, nothing unoriginal, overall just a boring cliche movie and boring.
This movie was boring af. Who thought of the plot for this garbage
Remix classic rock song idea is played out.
Jenna Ortegas lucky year
The thumbnail is scary lol she really can make horror look real
Just saw this movie yesterday and wow I absolutely loved it, it has a nice plot, it has a little bit of everything, 100% recommend!
oh my god The wife is a porn addict!!!!
Cudder
This movie was done so right there has not been a good scary movie out in a while and this was chef kiss the fashion the detail deaths you fall in love with the characters I loved this movie it could be done in VHS film and it would be perfect
What a trailer!
there is a post-credits scene fwiw
👎👎👉🏾💩
This shit low key trash. directors always wanna come off edgy af.
Just saw it today really creepy ,and gory !!
It’s pretty solid movie from A24, just watched it in theatre hour ago, I still prefer hereditary with haunting plot than murdering plot. But i did. enjoy it to (especially first part of movie 😂
Love thisss!!!
Britney Snow- Prom night and John tucker Must Die ❤️
movie was trash
Song name?
I thought I saw kid cudi..
Great movie
Amazing movie! Highly recommend to any horror fan!
Yep its greaat
Just saw the movie. Loved it. It doesn't disappoint. The guy who edited this trailer is a genius in his craft. Love the sound also
I will forever be traumatized from this movie.
This should’ve been titled Attack of the Horny Grandma
Just watched it. Started off hard ended soft. There's my review 😉
It’s a great movie.   There were only 2 other people in my theater and they both walked out. 🤣
First The Babysitter: Killer Queen, then Scream 5, and now X? At this point, Jenna Ortega is officially a horror-movie actress now, undoubtedly confirmed! 👌
what other A24 horror/thiler movies do y’all recommend?
Was it just me or watching Jen Ortega "take it" in the movie a uncomfortable scene?  She looks super young in the film..so it felt like watching a little kid get banged ..idk..that scene just didn't sit well. Aside from that the movie was Soo good.
amazing
Favorite horror movie of the year.
I thought that was Kellie Pickler and not Brittany Snow.
Great movie
This looks sooo bad it’s funny
An original movie that's actually good? say it ain't so!
Crazy the lack of promotion this movie got or maybe because Batman is still out, but went and saw this last night. Only 3 other people in the theater.   Having said that, this one does NOT disappoint. I may go see it again tonight. HIGHLY RECOMMEND to any horror fan. Great movie
I watched it and it was great 😌
HORROR FANS: Would you make friends with a fellow horror fan who happens to be gay?
I can already tell this does everything better than the new texas chainsaw
This movie is crazy
Going Monday so I can chill and take it in with crowds!
The elderly female body as the scariest thing we can think of...peak America.
The music choice was dope asf I mite see this
So I just saw the movie. It was.. a movie. The pacing was off and they squeezed all the kills into the last 12 minutes of the movie. The villains weren’t scary and the movie relied simply on jump scares. Speaking of, the jump scares were forecasted making them even less scary. The first half of the movie although slow was setting up for a better ending than what was delivered. 6/10
Ok, no dejo de pensar en Jenna Ortega 😳
Mia Goth and Brittany Snow devoured this movie
Saw the movie last night. Anyone that’s on the fence go watch it for yourself don’t listen to the negative comments. Personally I really liked it.
Stupid horror
Best Horror movie of  2022
This movie scared the living s*** out of my girlfriend and I. It’s like a 1970’s hereditary & VHS teamed up with cabin in the woods & The Evil Dead. Smooth transitions and clever foreshadowing, even Greater character development. Plot; 100% A24 unique and Original
Anyone know the song name by chance?
I have no words to describe what I just watched. 2 thumbs up. Entire theater was laughing and groaning. This movie is so fucking uncomfortable.
if 6 was 9. still can't wrap my head around re-produced old songs for trailers, but it's better than whatever else poopy movies are being produced for theaters these days.
HORROR FANS: Would you make friends with a fellow horror fan who happens to be gay?  (I'm not fully gay)
Instigante, o trailer mostrou bastante coisa mas juro que não entendi nada e como parece bom fiquei com vontade de ver.
Just saw this today and I loved it. Something told me to stick around til after the credits and it was worth it.
Be sure to stay after the credits!! You won't be disappointed!! :)
Just watched this movie; Absolutely loved it!
Alright well everybody's got a review of this movie I just got in from watching it and let me say I thought it was pretty good I liked the seventies the fact everything was right on point I couldn't see anything that was not seventies related the storyline was good original I think I hate was that they showed the killer too quickly they should have more suspense for that there was I can't really pick a thing wrong with the movie here the Gore was pretty good it's kind of light though it wasn't really that Gore It was very very light the nudities there for everybody while it's a different titties I think the scariest part was the old folks having sex I'm deaf I am definitely gonna have nightmares a nap on but other than that the whole movie was excellent I gave a 13 out of 13 skulls way to go however wrote this movie this movie that was very well original I have seen missing a white kit get very well written very well acted dad no 2 surprises everything was good I enjoyed it I wish there could be a sequel but not by the way it ended I don't think I see one coming but other than that like I said I would highly recommend you to go out and see this movie here Not a lot of blood and Gordo for the gorfans not bad the horror movie it's kind of low budget horror more of APG Sort of APG rated porno porno film if you want to call it that it was more like softcore porn basically with a little blood in it but that wasn't about it really that's what it reminded me of as the softcore porn and a 70 steam I was not there it wasn't a bad movie I kind of enjoyed it so the person I saw it was and that was probably about maybe 10 of us in the whole theater and the theater holds a 165 people so so Ah I don't know if it was just because it was raining out and nobody wanted to go or nobody's just going to the show or what but I go at least 3 days weeks I go see my reviews everywhere and I review movies every day From 1 PM to 5 Ami do nothing but review movies so I go see a lot of my reviews
Well, off to read the plot on wikipedia. This is the kind of movie I want to know what happens, but can't be bothered actually watching it.
I loved the music and atmosphere. The movie had a suspenseful and creepy style. My only issue was that I didn't like the ending. The women were easy on the eyes but the movie doesn't make the audience care about their survival due to the cocky attitudes of all characters. Unlike most horror films, I found myself wishing death to everyone in the movie..
It was pretty good
The scream at 2:15…the people who watched scream knows who’s scream that is
I just saw it on opening day a few hours ago! Very impressed! Don’t go in expecting to be scared shitless, go in expecting a black comedy with good slasher moments and nice cinematography. It was actually very funny in parts, and pretty fucked up in some. The acting was good too, it added to the black comedy of it all. Highly recommend if you love old 70-80s slasher films and dark comedy.
Watching the movie in 20 minutes at my local theatre ✌️ I’ll be back in a few hours
Watched this in the Theaters yesterday and wow, what a creepy movie. Excellent movie! Well done again Studio A24 😎
Song name?
Jenna Ortega had a sex scene Bett
Seeing it tomorrow.  Looking forward to it
This looks like the visit but  an older version
How do y’all think the black dude died? Or do y’all think he alive?
OMG
Let’s take a second to appreciate the creativity of the movie title
Saw last night going to finish it today I thought the beginning was very slow but I had to leave when it started getting crazy. Can’t wait to finish it in a couple minutes
Man that was a good trailer
"Hey so these people are creepy lets leave."  "Ok."  *roll credits*
Going to see it tonight!
I like the 70s aesthetic but judging from this preview this looks like itll be the weakest a24 horror concept. I will hold my criticism until i see the movie though
This movie was amazing I felt like I was watching something totally new something never done before , so different, artistic, unfiltered, sexual, clever, it has so many good subtexts that are displayed in an ambience of mystery and sexual insecurities, if you can grasp the details of the scenes youre going to be blown away 🔥🔥🔥🔥. Its not commercial at all which is even better.
Oh, So a Group of white women make a porno with a black dude f#$&ing them and they all get killed... Maybe the killer Doesn't like interracial porn?
Techs massacre/ wrong turn/
Another cliche trend chasing cash grab. Mia goth is one of the most unattractive females in Hollywood
I hate trailers sometimes I feel Like I know what’s going to happens especially that last dialogue with police
It was good!
My theory is the old man is the old lady Gonna see it tomorrow
this movie sucked there is not twist its just the trailer
This was the worst movie I’ve ever seen
Am I the only one expecting a genital mutilation in this movie? I mean the characters are filming porn, so that kind of kill would make sense in the movie.
Trailer uses Foghat? Sold.
This looks
The best, I repeat, the best film of 2022 so far.
Okay Mr Scott Mescudi!
Jenna Ortega IS KILLING IT. From You-until now she’s really about to take over the industry, she’s so talented.
Showed every kill in the movie lol
Kid Cudi in a A24 film is so legendary
Such a great movie
I just watched it and I recommend staying after the credits
Ok A24 you have my attention and this looks like something that won’t put me to sleep.
Brittany Snow Hive rise up!!!!
A24 always be on some traumatizing sh*t. makes me feel like a helpless kid again. I love it.
Camera man got cucked LMAO
Love me Ty West!!!
what song are they using?
Does the guy with the Afro die first
Loved House of the Devil, can’t wait to see Ti West kill the vintage stylized horror even more
WHATS THE NAME OF THE SONG?
Not the Hannah Montana movie house
A24 is just too edgy for me
Oh snap, Kid Cudi!!!
This reminds me of the visit
Jenny Ortega has been in 3 different horror movies in the last 3 months! lol damn girl I C U 👀🤣 I seen her get killed by a demon (studio 666), stabbed by a serial killer (scream), and now im guessing grandma gonna butcher her ass (x) lol ngl she kinda hot but i still dnt think this movie is scary enough idk.. so far i haven't been impressed by any movie yet, her acting in every movie tho haha it's been fun to watch her range xD it makes me feel like it's still halloween, idk why they dnt wait til october to drop all this films
will it be good or won't it?  can't tell here.
Texas Chainsaw vibes. Ive always loved 1970s style cinematography
Bet the poor black guy dies 1st
Evil is always near the 70s
What’s the name of the song
We need an A24 Silent Hill 2 film.
Pile of crap
Looks like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, without the Chainsaw. I can't wait!
I do not remember the last time a slasher film received good reviews! I’m so excited for this one!!
This movie is gonna make the cinema all sticky  god dam people always tipping their slushy it’s annoying
“That’s one uglay son of a bitch..” 😂
Wait is that Scott mescudi
I read Brittany Snow and Jenna Ortega bare it all on-screen for the first time in their movie careers, so looking forward to those scenes.
looks like shit... just screams and some random naked old lady which you can fly kick out of this world. Sex scenes dont sell such a pathetic movie.
I feel like this trailer kinda gives us nothing but why do i still really wanna watch this lol
I love Ti West. He's very understated. I get a lot of 70s TCM vibes from this trailer. Could you imagine if he directed the new TCM.
this looks awful and why is jenna ortega in it she’s barely an adult yall nasty
Idk this feels very Ted Bundy to me. The way he’d “explain” why he did what he did; the whole porno & violent sexual acts in porno. Intertwining the 2 genres w this one.
how am i supposed to ask my friend to watch this with all the sexual scenes & im definitely not gonna watch it with my family 💀😭
I really wanna see this flick, but damn if I'm not pissed off at the unskippable ads that give away all the good shit.
I wish I could watch this
what song is playing throughout the trailer?
What is the song?
Nah
Not gonna see it. Even in horror movies they have to be woke.
Jenna Ortega….oh gawd 🤤
I’m so excited for this
Idk it’s not giving
Ti West is back!!
Interesting concept.
Music is awful.
So he ripped off the visit, TCM, and  knives out with the movie changing what it is half way thru.. I guess he doesn't do original films. House of the devil was rosemary's baby and sacrament was about him.jones🙄
I thought Ti West's name would be enough to convince me to see this.  It's not.
Only watching for Jenna
A24 never fails.
This is basically just the Game Granny lol
I'm watching this definitely! Mostly because of Jenna Ortega though not gonna lie. I loved her in Scream , she's starting to become a horror movie actress. She has skills in front of the camera.
Definitely gives off that “Texas Chainsaw Massacre” vibe😰I’m so down to see this😄
Just finished this movie right now AND GO WATCH IT!! It's a fun slasher movie that feels very 80s. I had so much fun watching it.
This really looks like a great movie 🎥 what I love about it is the 60’s to 70’s theme, as a fan of horror movies it’s amazing to see even in 2022 The western types of scenery are coming back to Theaters, for me this is a must watch movie, really looking forward to watching it.
A24 films never get the attention they deserve!
Just like the Texas chainsaw massacre made in the 2000s
A24 is hit or miss when it comes to horror but this looks interesting .
Can’t wait to see Brittany back in action 👏
Plot twist:  This is actually a Texas Chainsaw Massacre prequel.
Is this seriously the best you can come up with? Recycling old tropes and stereotypes? Like the last couple I'll just skip.
Looks very Rob Zombie-esque. I love it!!!
This looks great!
This looks killer (see what I did there?)! Jenna Ortega was a pleasant surprise in the new Scream movie, she's on her way to becoming this generation's scream queen. Great looking ensemble cast too, looks genuinely original... the "story can't change midway through" got me hooked!
Damn*** 👀 looks interesting 🤨
This is so good..😍
Most likely will be a total letdown, i've seen several Ti West movies, and not a single one has been better than mediocre.
a24 does it again
CAN'T WAIT TO GO SEE IT THIS WEEKEND!! 70'S MOVIE SCENE. RIGHT UP MY ALLEY!!
THEY GOT KID CUDI IN THIS?!?! 😱 Now in definitely hypeddd!!!
Just 24GOD
Trash!!!!!!  They’re sexualizing Jenna Ortega. She is a child. She may be 18 but she literally looks 10 years old.  Who ever wrote this trash movie is a pedo.
What song is in the trailer?
Looks like a good one. A cross between House of 1000 Corpses meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre 👀
I'm check it out.  "X" better be good!  Got a free ticket!
Great edit. I feel like I just watched a really cool short film.
A Texas chainsaw massacre vibe that meets the Visit
HOW DO THEY KEEP MAKING BANGERS
That movie looks 🗑🗑🗑🗑
Tf is going on
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16 KJV,  Jesus Christ is the only way.......
A24 really keen on reminding me how creepy old people can be.
What is the music on this trailer? Film looks amazing cant wait to see it 💙💙💙
I keep forgetting that Jenna Ortega isn’t a minor
The film many evangelicals will hate and fear!
If this title came out back in the 1990s or early 2000s, it would’ve been threatened with an NC-17. Happy to see it’s likely R uncut.
Song?
It’s giving Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Taking of Deborah Logan I’m so excited
Jenna Ortega is really making a name for herself and I love it! Just saw Scream 5, I think she’s great and has a bright future!  Also I fucking love Brittany Snow 😍
I will never watch this flick because it is overly advertised. Hate that
Any movie trailer that uses a Foghat song? I’m so there!
This looks so good
I have such high hopes for this movie
Kid Cudi!🤌🏼
Hey Hollywood, one thing about horror movie trailers, maybe do NOT show the whole story in the trailers, including which characters die??? Sheesh.
I will not watch your disgusting race mixing propaganda
Where will i be able to watch this when it is released? Will it be a youtube thing ? Or …
Nice!
A24 used to be good this is so generic and lame it feels like a regular horror movie
Why is no one asking what the song playing is??? Anybody know?? Movie looks dope!
A24 is also making everything everywhere all at once which is unique too!
There is a an X-rated film titled, “Farmer’s Daughters” coincidental of A24’s X 70s pornstar character(s) to mention the title of  their movie they’re filming on a farmer’s farm without a permit lol!
Porn and horror, wait until they get a load of this.
A24s pretentiousness never fails to amaze me. Hereditary sucked balls.
1:03 your welcome
Some shots look like the original texas chainsaw massacre
Looks like the ranch house of Maggie in the walking dead season 2.
Boring
its looks like a mix movie of: “Deathproof”,”The Taking of Deborah Logan” and “Girlhouse” 😳
ortega is caked lol
CUDI
I am intrigued
I was looking for Kid Cudi everywhere son of a bitch put a mustache on him and he’s unrecognizable!
I keep giving this studio a chance - Hereditary was terrible and even worse The Witch. Horrible. Midsommar was another disaster with some shocking deaths.
This movie reminds me of the game Granny 😂
Oh look, race-mixing propaganda involving a blonde woman doing porn with a black man.. I wonder *which* ethnicity produced this film… *goblin’s hand-rubbing intensifies*
bruh, what😭this looks so good
What's the music in this trailer?
Isn't that white house leatherface's house?
The song is "I just want to make love to you" by Foghat
Please make this the new gen genre. Save the cinema from generic new gen evolutionary bullshit
I'm still having trouble understanding the plot here. I get they're making an adult film but I'm lost after that.
This looks fucking incredible
Altman’s 3 Women meets Texas Chainsaw ‘74…ummm yes pls thank you
what's the name of the song used .?
I expect to see violence, Graphic Nudity,  and strong sexual content
That is the Walking Dead farm isn't it ?
That actually look good
A24 is so bad
Ti West I AM ALL IN. Boogie Nights meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
What song?
This is going to be goooood 😁
Holy shit, I'll go see this.
I bet this movie is about a guy getting gullible people to be in a snuff film and his efforts are somewhat thwarted by the old couple.
OMG JENNA😍😍😍
A24 has been killin it since 2015-Amy, Ex Machina, Room, Moonlight, Hereditary, Eighth Grade, Lady Bird, Midsommar, Minari, Uncut Gems etc. I could go on but usually if you see the A24 logo on a horror movie-it’s gonna be a mind-bending, uniquely terrifying ride.
Disney continues to churn out the classy sophisticated types. 19 years old and I am going to play a porn actress? You still have child fans. Why do people make these decisions?
Oh Wow
return of ti west!!!
Looks like a better Texas Chain Massacre remake than the ACTUAL Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake
Foghat makes this trailer a million times cooler! Can't wait watch the movie!
A24 movies always gets me🔥🔥🔥
0:32 Dudes face looks like a mashup of Luke Wilson and Kurt Russell
Jenny Ortega is getting a lot award
Songs name???
1:08 "If daddy catches us, there's no telling what he might do." Cuts to shot of sausage being cut.
A24 simply does NOT miss ! Banger after banger !
They literally played the whole movie
Song in the trailer?
SLAYER ❗❗❗
Loving the horror movie version of boogie nights feel guessing the old woman is a succubus and I think Mia Goth's character is involved with the old couples dealings as well maybe especially considering the poster with her on it.
What’s the original track used as the trailer music?
I'm all in on this one! Looks like a 70s grind house flick , I love it 😀
This trailer is awesome. Should definitely win an award.
What is this name of the song in this?
Ass 2 ass?  My kind of movie
Looks dumb af
That intense home depot beat tho
Trailer looks like a sleazy 70's porn flick that turns into a Texas chainsaw massacre horror flick in minutes of the film starting. Looks really interesting and the film style is cool.
Music: I just want to make love to you - Foghat
Amazing!!! 🤩🤩🤩
Jenny Ortega is starting to show her true acting skills. this movie looks really interesting. definitely looking forward to this.
Whats the song name? Edit: found it, its "I just want to make love to you by Foghat
I dont even know how i watched the trailer and ignored it was cudi
Brittany looks phenomenal...
BRUH NOOOOOO! As soon as "Hereditary" flashed across the screen I almost closed the whole damn browser. That movie scarred me for months.
A24 is back! had me scared there for a bit
Um...they should include the old lady in the lesbian scenes...
I was kind of excited about seeing this at SXSW, but it looks kind of generic.
Also see Touch of Satan.
man I hope the brother ain't the first to go ..
Whether the movie is good or not, they sure did a great job getting my attention with the trailer! 🔥🔥 A 2 4 🔥🔥
Kid Cudi about to be the dead black guy in a horror film
This looks like the perfect complement piece to watch with the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre as a double feature.
Oh yay.  Another freaking horror movie that looks to have all the bloody/scary/good parts filmed in darkness and/or with flashing lights.  I can't wait.
"There ain't nobody else out there like you." "Why?" "Because you ain't got no eyebrows."
Was there an alligator coming out of the water at one point? I can't tell what that is.
I wonder if it’s a creature feature movie?
Who else initially thought this was X-men?
What's with the old lady
Foghat(& Lonesome Dave) Lives!💖
Is this going to be in the movie theater
this looks good on so many levels!
I absolutely cannot wait to see this in theaters. It’s giving me some serious “greens room” vibes (another A24 classic) and that movie had me on the edge of my seat for 2hours straight. I have a feeling this movie will be just as (if not more) intense.
what's the song at 1:06?
So.... black man dies first.  The will be injured or infected next (basically will suffer as punishment for having sex with a black man) . Then paint by number horror. You're not breaking any new ground Ti West
I'm in

X gon' give it to ya f*** wait for you to get it on your own X gon' deliver to ya Knock knock, open up the door, it's real Wit the non-stop, pop pop and stainless steel
Mia Goth! Yes!
For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul?  For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord  For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

More interracial shit. Just what the world needs.
Man that cutting sausage scene... Ahhh gives me goosebumps...
Oooosh the bro Martin Henderson!
Girl at 1:04 looks like Taylor Russell!!
You mean Kid Cudi?
Happy to see Owen C in this . He’s a great actor
looks terrible
This looks pretty good
Looks terrible tbh...
“And the studio that brought you “Hereditary”” - welp this is gonna be crazy.
What is name of song in trailer?
I bow before you A24
they are recording a fucked up porno 😂😂
a 70s porno being made in a farmhouse with a sadistic grandma after night , and a girl wants to be put in the scene, theres some type of symbolism in all this 😂
well... that movie's gonna suck... we just seen a lot of false jump scares edited together to make it look scary and exciting while actually being anything but....
Here's the pitch: Texas Chainsaw meets Debbie Does Dallas.
This looks very good, and I DO want to see it, but I am apprehensive. After the trailer got me drooling, I watched House of the Devil. Bored, and the last act did not make up for it. Just watched the Innkeepers... bored and again the last act did nothing for me as it was too little too late and not very well executed. I watched that Western he did years ago, and I remember thinking it was one of the least interesting Westerns I have ever seen, so this one... I now have low expectations 😓
KID CUDI 🔥🔥🔥
they did such a good job paying homage to chainsaw massacre that I thought they were using clips from the original movie in some shots. well done
It had to be Ti West. If you've seen "House of the devil" you know he's awesome at 70s throw back horror.
When ur mind drifted to the sexual imagination and a rotten grandma shows up is how one get erectile dysfunction 🤣🤣🤣🤣
does this mean we're gonna finally see a jenna ortega sex scene?
Yay Brittney Snow
This is so Jewish lmfao
Texas chainsaw massacre meets boogie Nights
Been a fan of Ti West for awhile. Good to see him back.
70s, Texas, and horror? Count me in!
It looks good , but can these production companies please stop showing the entire movie in the trailer.  It should just show you enough to get you interested but keep you wanting more.
Was that a crocodile?
Oh yeah old-timer sex! LOL - This looks like a horror slasher from the 70's.
The new Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie on Netflix, should've been more like this!
Idk the whole old people are evil thing doesn't really do it for me. Same issue I had with the visit. The period piece angle was a nice choice though props on making that look good👌
NOPE looks so much better
A24 baby!!!! Need I say more?!
What’s the song called?
Jenna Ortega in another horror movie?  Yes please.
Should of fckd off lmaoo
Professor X
lmfao they trying to be texas chain saw but looks stupid
#######|X
I'm down
I saw the poster for this last Saturday when I went to see "Death on the Nile." I LOVE Ti West's films, and I'm so ready for this! I even love "Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever." I feel it's severely underrated.
this looks so fucking stupid
Looks good but I think I'd rather watch the movie they were planning on making.
Thought this had something to do with x-men 💀
What is the song name?
A24 studios bringing its A game as always. 🤟
Hell yeah!
lmao they did her dirty with the thumbnail
I wanna find this version of the song
Damn this might be the first A24 film I don't want to watch
...seriously, though...this is what the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie should have been about...Leatherface chasing porn stars... 😵
This is an incredibly well-edited trailer. And shout out to Kid Cudi!
music pls
This is a modern adaptation of The VIsitor, looks great.
I mean you just showed the whole movie but neat sure.
Ngl I’m gonna watch this just for that one Jenna Ortega scene. We both know which one I’m talking abt.
0:54 this reminds me of that part in To Kill a Mockingbird where Mayella Ewell invites Tom Robinson in to fix her dresser
i got 4 seconds in before i was like, "whack".
A24 only knows how to make absolute bangers. Never get a trailer wrong and always deliver. I have not seen a single A24 movie to date that didnt leave me with a sense of silence and spend the next few hours analyzing and decompressing from the masterpiece I wasnt ever ready for even though I know the same feeling happens every time.
I just Googled the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre house to make sure this isn't a prequel. Different houses, but I'm still not 100% convinced...
This makes me think of "The Visit" by  M. Night.... Sundowning.
this movie looks genuinely creepy man
I’m just here for the retro porn sex scenes.
This looks verys authentic 70s. But that guy is trying really hard to act like Mathew McConaughey.
Someone please tell me what this song is
"...Gon give it to ya"
What's the song?
Anyone know the song name?
I didn't even recognize Kid Cudi
🤣😨😱🤣
Unsettling and extreme as always. 1:54 reminded me of The Evil WIthin 2.
Okay I,lol watch
SO READY FOR A NEW HORROR CLASSIC
Ya already had me with Ti West.
Love me some Ti West.
not the bizarvark girl nooooo
Ti west came back to make a new movie I remember watching his movie call cabin fever 2 its good but alot people hate it
Revelation chapter 9 The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key  to the shaft of the Abyss. It's going to be a movie 🍿🎥
A24, entenda: EU AMO VOCES DEMAIS!!! sempre entregam quando o assunto é produção. E eu estou ansioso pra assistir mais um filme.
dam i want to knock out two birds with one stone. jackoff and a scare thrill , NICE LOL
That looks awesome
A24 keeps saving the goddamn movie industry!
say what now?  this looks promising
More like Resident Evil 7: XXX Edition
What's the name of the song used
The blonde white girl is hot.  All I got from this.
This isn’t about X-Men.
Looks great, but you show way too much.
Great another shit movie, with drawn out horror esc scenes
Group of Adult stars and directors vs feeble and curious old couple. 🤔  Level of Intelligence: Horror Movie Victims with no common sense.
This is like The Visit but with adults
Damn I feel like the last 20 seconds gave away the ending of the movie.  Everyone dies, they find the camera.  Ugh.
I think this is going to be their first good film yet.
"come inside"
KID MF CUDI
Same stuff every movie. Some messed up sexual torture and rape. Naked old people walking around. Pointless.
Of course Mia Goth is in this movie
I don't even know if I want to see the entire movie, but the damned trailer ALONE was worth my time. A24 is relighting the fire of what made movies worth it back in the day.
Horror movie about porn.   I'm honestly intrigued by what they're going to try and say here.
8
Hi a24 we miss Ari aster by the way, it's been over 3 years since his last release
If there's a24 in it then take my money
X gon give it to you
Dam this looks good.
Telling the truth about the horrible history of this country and it's melinated people and making a horror film out of it. I guess that's what we need to do to spoon feed our nightmarish history to the public. I will watch this.
Ok, I'm hooked!
Good trailer. Still have nightmares of Hereditary. But that was a good movie.
Kinda hate they spoiled the ending, but overall it looks good!
It's Zendaya and Jenna Ortega's world and we're all just living in it.
What song is it, that they hav used?
I watched this trailer more than anybody I'm hyped man
A24. Even the trailers are next level.
what song is being used in this trailer?
Damn, that scream at 1:47 is really good. Kinda sells me on this alone
I love the 70s setting. Can’t wait to see it
Yawn
Ti West doesn't miss
this gave me CHILLS
I love the song does anybody know the name of the song?😀
X gonna give it to ya.

I'm one of those older dudes that think almost all new movies suck. But when I see A24 is behind something, my ears perk up.
Cudi an actor now?
why did they add such a pathetic song during trailer, its too hard to watch!
King of the 70’s style horror slow burn is back. Can’t fkn wait!!
gon give it to ya?
What song is this
lol does jenna ortega really get naked in this
Nana just wants to be in your movie, she likes dark meat.
What's the name of the song that's playing in the background at 0:24
Too spoilery
jenna ortega is becoming a new scream queen <3 love that for her
This is literally texas chainsaw 1
I am looking forwad to this movie.  It looks really, really good.  I'd be scared to going filming on some old man's farm like that.
After her fantastic opening scene in Scream (2022), I'm a believer of Jenna Ortega now.
L.  Youngboy better.
SCOTT!
Hollywood is such fucking shit.
This looks so fun
Seems a missed opportunity for a movie named X to be rated R.
A24 is my new favorite movie company. Damn everything they put out is ground breaking. I gotta audition for one of their films.
Kid Cudi looking like  a young Black Dynamite
I've yet to see a bad A24 movie.  The trailer is giving me Jordan Peele vibes where the use of a song in the trailer is concerned.
im def gonna shit my britches in this one. old people scare tf out me
Uat the fuk was that?
Kid Cudi, Lou Pucci ---- say no more. This looks AMAZING!
Jenna Ortega has been doing some good work lately!
I'm here for Jenna tbh haha
A country farmhouse, sheriff's office, axes and blood...zzzzzzz
Yessssssss!
😳😳😳
That was a really good horror movie scream out of Jenna
oh this looks cheep as hell
Dung
I thought britanny snow was dead
only on DIsney+
K but trailers like this make me feel like I pretty much just watched the whole movie. No need to see it.
THIS LOOKS SO SICK. A24. Ti West. Jenna Ortega. Brittany Snow. Mia Goth. Cudi?! And this looks like Texas Chainsaw’s wet dream. It looks more Texas Chainsaw than Texas Chainsaw does. I’m living for it.
You Know good well This movie should have an NC-17 rating
Yo I can't wait to watch the Jah biopic.
I think the black person dies 💀
Song name?
it looks so good and A24 dont miss
Probably the best Trailer I have ever seen.
So... No DMX?
Name of the Soundtrack ?
Zcvn
This movie should be called "Based Grandma" lol
So this is what a weekend with Matt Gaetz looks like...
Now THIS is what modern day horror should look like. A twisted 70’s nightmare that gives off major TCM vibes. I’m in.
Long live A24 man ✊
Yes please
At least it’s not being written by that strange jealous guy who got dumped and made a movie about how he fantasizes about burning his ex alive... ya know, Ari Aster.
It’s giving very much Texas Chainsaw Masacre vibes
I hate this. This is disturbing. Ima still watch it anyway
Finally some plot to my porn
Bro Jenna Ortega can’t miss…you, scream,babysitter,the fallout
ﾒﾁｬｸﾁｬおもしろそう
You lied and did this to your own family. May your children die sickly with disease. . I have nothing but egg for you people considering you watch me stand there begging in the snow and rain for so so so very long
this shit look terrible
Thought this was gonna be a movie about x-23 😂😂
how many movies is A24 gonna release this year? 😂
Kid cudi
I like Jenna Ortega. She's a good actress. 🥰
This is the story of Rose after Titanic.
I'm in.
They give away a major death in the trailer.. not gonna give time cause I dont wanna ruin it for ppl and I didnt even mean to catch it but they show his dead body and its pretty easy to figure out what happens to him.. And why isnt anyone giving any love to the dude with glasses.. He was in Super Dark Times which was a badass movie. Glad to see hes still acting becacuse Charlie Tahan obviously  had Ozark and I hadnt seen Owen Campbell in anything until this.. and he was the main lead in Super Dark Times so I was always wondering where he had been at.
I have the utmost faith in A24 to at the very least come with something interesting and very likely a classic. Very much looking forward to this.
This movie looks horrible
Kid Cudi! Looks dope
A24 always makes original films, watching their films is refreshing and exciting. Im tired of the reboots and remakes
2:03 old people fucking
Jenna Ortega has been killing it
This looks hilarious!!!!!!!!!
Really been liking A24 but this one looks a bit odd to me. I hope it does well though!
A24 <3
adults in a farm instead of teenagers in a summer camp
2:17 . Coach from Left 4 dead?
Genius, can't wait to see it.
Hell YEEEAAAAHHHH
X gonna give it to you
A24 love or hate, they keep trying to not copy and paste. This may be the most straightforward thing they do but I'm in
qcL
looks fun to watch
can't wait for the sequel  Y
Looks lame.
This seems to be a fairly accurate biopic about the seminal L.A. punk band "X".   D.J. Bonebrake is actually one of the producers.
Movie trailers should be 1 minute
This is totally my type of movie....👍🏻
A24 hasn't made a single bad movie
Song?
Like Ti West but this looks rather vapid.
I'm going to watch this because my girlfriend Jenna Ortega is in it.
I'm all over this!
A must see…
@cia 😉
I've been waiting for a Ti West horror movie for awhile now and glad to see him back.
Reminds me of Texas Chainsaw massacre ! Looks dope af
Kid Cudi for the win. Glad to see to see him acting
Oh no gas 24
X QC
wow, my favorite actor
Feels like a movie Eli Roth would have done 2 decades ago or Tarantino would do if he did horror movies lol.
seems like a lot of directors are going for that old movie vibe and i'm here for it
A slasher from A24?! Sign me up!
Jenna Ortega <3
Resident evil 7
This looks like it has the potential to be Ti West’s best film yet!!
Rest of bollywood struggling to make a decent horror flick while A24 over here is making a killing. Go figure.
Ok, don't even need to watch it.  You had me at the studio behind 'Hereditary'.  A movie that I, a 34 year old Army Veteran, can't watch without having trouble sleeping, lol.
xd
Big resident evil 7 and texas chainsaw vibes from this
Well, this isn’t very pagman.
A24 is a top notch studio but this just looks gross and stupid
What’s the song ?
mia goth is seriously so pretty, i can’t wait to see her & jenna ortega in this movie
This looks good
Here for it!!!
The sucking off of a production company is nauseating
please tell me jenna ortega gets in on the action in this movie
Scott needs to be in more movies !
I am searching everywhere for this trailer song and I can't find the name of it anywhere. Anyone know it?
When I saw this trailer I thought it was the Texas chainsaw massacre that was supposed to come out and got really excited at the aspect of A24 doing TCM, then I saw the actual tcm trailer and was utterly disappointed.
Was it so diffiult to cast some black actress for this black dude? So tired of this mixed crap promoted by hollywood recently
Kid Cudi??
Prepare for another ugly cry scream that makes everyone uncomfortable.
So its a mix between porn and horror...
👀
cudder
does anyone know what remix of i just wanna make love to you this is? i know the original, but i want this version of the song
Lmao kid cudi with an afro
COOL
Sudden showing up of FROM THE STUDIO THAT BROUGHT HEREDITARY on the screen was a cock block. That was a shitty movie
Jenna Ortega it's the new Scream Queen of our generation and I love her ❤️
Resident Evil 7 movie lookin awesome!
This looks God awful!!!
Looks very nice!
After watching Jenna Ortega in Scream 5 I have high hopes for this! She is a great young actress.
some really fucking good actors is this
Where does this movie stream
Why do they show this on YouTube
Omg guys look its granny x the texas chainsaw massacre 😍
Finally they look like they’re in the 70’s and not in texan in the 2000’s
So just like the texas chainsaw?
There was so many horror movie references I can’t wait !
Jenna Ortega is incredible
File_D 1-2-3-4
This looks wild and campy. I'm in.
v tcm
A24 has to be one of the best companies of all time.
Do people only know Jenna Ortega from Scream? Or what else is there
I was not expecting this from Brittany Snow.
is this movie with the Tarantino seal of quality?
I'm watching this for Jenna
L
KID CUDIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII and A24!!!!  *dies of joy
I'm so ready for this!
what is happening A24 movies now?? 2022 isn't looking good for them.
gonna watch this just cause of kid cudi, and ofc cause its a24
Hereditary is one of the best horror movie i have ever watched. Definitely going to watch this
I thought they a movie about x or I thought x was in the movie 😅
Excited for southern gothic fiction honestly.
Watch this turn out to be a better Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie than the TCM Netflix requel.
Oh, Brittany... just can't catch a break, huh? I mean, the Pitch Perfect movies are shit, but at least they're big studio shit. This is just... Oh, boy...
cant wait for Y and z
Omg otra vez A24 nos prepara algo increible
They all died. The End.
weirdest X-Men movie yet but I'm game!
This looks so cool

this looks so good holy shit
i got massive vibes of texas chainsaw massacre
KID CUDI HELL YEAAAAAAAAAAA
Not a fan of Hereditary at all but this looks pretty epic. Plus Jenna <3
no thanks POS
Can't believe they made a horror movie about exes
Texas chainsaw while filming a porn movie..borring... :/
Looks horrible not gonna be a watch from me and I’m a big a24 fan
Wow its shit!
The old man is the old woman?
Not sure if this was asked already, but does anyone know the name of the song??
I thought it was an X-Men movie. Darn.
old people scary
Whats the name of the song in this trailer
I'm here for mia .
Dang, thought it was gonna be a new x-men movie
A lots of bots in the comments saying the same thing so that's nice Susan...
Scott Mescudi ❤
idk what to expect but im excited
Does anybody know who made the song in the trailer?
really looking forward to this one!
Well this looks like a giant heap of crap.
Reminds me of Touch of Satan
*hol up for a short petite girl jenna got a lil wagon on her ok I see her*
I love the 70s setting and horror mixed with comedy! I wish there was a release date.
This looks super good!! A24 always impresses me!! ❌
The "Story can't change midway through" line was gloriously meta as the trailer went from feeling like a period piece on porno to a horror flick right after that point.
srsly an old lady? This grandma can barely walk and you expect me to believe shes a killer? Just drop kick her old ass. THE END.
Wanting to say can I have a backstory of this movie?
kid cudi acting again nice
Somebody was in my bed touching me. Classic horror movie! Love that 70s look.
Oy! sorry if already asked but do someone have the name of the song ??
“I get old, chicks stay the same age”
Looks like poop unless all you care about is aesthetics
I really like the zooms. More things should be made in the old style as it gives them a more unique feeling.
well i know no one asked my opinion but here's the deal, my bets are: *possible spoilers ahead*                                                                                                    1° bet: one of the old fellas is a man-eating alien disguised, or both i don't know, it is possible (the one that convinces me the most, given that intriguing shot on the river at night)  2° bet: the old lady is a ghoul, zombie that eats humans  3° bet: the old lady is in fact a very horny psycopath  4° bet: she's just a ghost (mostly not but i think it's worth mentioning)  and that's it! if the movie somehow manages to surprise me on the killer origin aspect i'm going to be very... well, surprised
A24 Movies are interesting
Jenny Ortega is my new favorite scream queen
Perhaps A24 has lived long enough to become the villain
if it really is as good as the trailer tells ya'lll....Damnn!!
Am I the only one that thinks the house looks exactly like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre house?
1:00 Give me 1 minutes to proceed this scene
This and Everything Everywhere All At Once look super fun! I don’t know how good they will be but they look entertaining as hell
A24 has been firing on all cylinders. I'm interested to see how they handle this.
Matthew McConaughey is fuckin good
ngl i saw X and thought htis was a new x man movie
This is where Ellie ends up after Joe Goldberg tries to make her life out of his mess lol
This reminds me on the Manson family cause they lived at a man like that ranch and made films
I thought it was X-Men, but this looks pretty good too
Looking forward to this! Love a good 70s horror vibe, A24, Mia Goth, and Jenna Ortega.
wow Kid Cuddy is gaining fame slowly in the movie world. Maybe the hip hop game  is not his thing anymore
@A24 In one of your commercials theres a guy and he says "how long did people expect to live anyways in the olden times?" People actually lived  just as long as now, it used to be until the 1980's that people lived  on average longer, but every year it has been dropping. Life expectancy is at it's lowest in 280 years.
Song?
1:37 sounds like Jason Stackhouse from True Blood lol 😆 😂 🤣!  A24, hats off to you!!! 👏 👒
bro i didnt even finish the damn trailer, its gonna suuuuck
Kid Cudi done slicked in another movie role💯
*I thought this was a new x men movie...*
Cudi
Can't have a old school horror without some raunchy sex😏
Give it to me raw and wriggling...This looks fun
I was about to post “Boogie Nights meets The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” but it looks like at least one commenter has beaten me to it.
Can't wait to see this one. X looks like a fun ride. To be continued..............
this looks like a hidden gem seriously the filming looks ironically “fresh” but also gives me vibes that its acrually texas chainsaw original level quality of horror here. Looks special
Anyone know the name of the song playing?
Ma girl ortega? The 70's setting? The tone?...im in.
instant classic
Like the grindhouse movies!!!
Looks like a movie you'd watch at a old drive in theater !!
This is "Horror Porn". Lets call it what it is.
X "R rated"
This is one f****d-up horror flick.
We need more A24 and a lot less Disney and their stupid franchise movies and remakes.
So Hype!
Touch  of Satan vibes.
JENNA ORTEGA.
The is gonna be sht!!
Granny the game got ha own movie look out.
so we suppose to feel sorry for a bunch of racetraitors ? literally filming blacked lol ?
That was poor nerd guy from the evil dead reboot. I hope, for his sake, they give him a quick death in this movie.
really trying to slander van life...
Doesnt look scary, im expecting a cool twist from A24
texas A24 massacre
Looks epic!!
This is gonna be so good, can't wait for the cinema release
A24 I hope your happy about firing the va from hazbin hotel you just ruined it for me
Eh, I'll stick to more thought provoking films.  This is more the speed of people who watch/like Fast and Furious movies!
54 sec of trailer(Trailers in our days tends to spoil everything), "hereditary" something, I had enough ! Gonna watch it. I hope it will be on Netflix.
The song for this ?
it looks aight
Wtf was that??
This is about to legendary
What's the song??
eww
Tbh I only knew about this movie because of brittany's ig story and is the reason why I want to watch this movie </3
The music for this trailer ruins everything.
Whoa.. Brazzer's is really taking they're production to a whole other level.
So Texas Chainsaw except Leatherface is an old lady sundowning?
Well....this looks dumb.
This looks great! Love A24 movies. Can anyone bless me with the name of Song/Songs in this trailer? Sounds like jimi hendrix but I can't find the song lol
Brittany Snow is unrecognizable! Great look for the movie. Cannot wait!
she was mad for horror you know who im taking about
Oh yes, there will be Nudity.
I was actually scared! I’ll watch
Always love A24 movies!!
Makers of Hereditary? Oh yea that gon GO. Also WTFF Kid Cudi?!!
Was the actor channeling Matthew McConaughey?
I think porn would be more entertaining.   This one tries to have a plot.
I hope that poor girl will allow herself some eyebrows one day.
It always works to use old people in horror movies 😂 my favourite one is the sundowning granda in the movie 'The Visit'.
Finally. No more fairy tale macbeth knight films. Back to uniqueness.  But when i say  " I miss the old naked people" I didnt mean it...
A24 never miss with their trailers, don't they?
This looks so fucking good.
I swear if I go watch this and it’s as ridiculous as Red Rocket I’m gonna lose my mind
This actually looks good
cant wait for this !!!!!
Did anybody else see both the thumbnail and title,  and thought this was gonna be a sequel to Logan
This feels like a Rob Zombie movie that i actually want to see
This shit looks insane
"The story can't just change midway through..." Very clever. I hate meta.
AYO DROP A TRAILER OF HAZBIN HOTEL NOW
The story can't just change midway through .......
omg it's Amber von Tussle
She got no eyebrows.
So we’re just making porn for the public now
X gonna give it to ya
This looks promising.
Well I'm seriously looking forward to this.
Yo, Kid Cudi looking like Shaft is a sight to see 😂😂😂😂
After watching Lamb and being thoroughly disappointed among most other fans, I’m extremely skeptical of what A24 has to offer horror wise without Ari Aster directing.
1:03
Lol
wtf is this lmao
A24 is probably the best film production company out there right now.
Can anyone tell me the song name?
well , we just saw the entire movie
Another cringey horror movie for teens. Nothing new in Hollywood
They USE THE SAME HOUSES in EVERY MOVIE 😂
A24 IS THE BEST, I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW NOBODY TALKS ABOUT U
Сюжет дурацкий и действия героев фильма вызывают смех.
Another banger by A24 Studio.
Xqc?
This looks fucking great. A24 definitely pushes the envelope with their films. Looks fun and genuinely terrifying. One of my most anticipated films now.
Song?🥺
It's from Ti West so it's guaranteed to be dog sh!+ garbage. He has a perfect track record....
I have yet to see a A-24 film 🎥 that I didn't really enjoy.
Is that the daughter from Mad Men? The blonde?
10-4  A/24...i'll be heading out to see this in Spring!
Ayooo
Original: Foghat - I Just Want To Make Love To You Trailer: Some kind of remix? Maybe just produced for the movie/trailer, but if someone knows this version of the song >> please let me know
This is going to be 100% a flop.
Texas Chainsaw Massacre much? Not hating, I'd happily watch this over 90% of recent horror films, but if you haven't watched Texas Chainsaw and think this is "original" based on the trailer...go meet Leatherface :)
This should've been titled "XXX", but some jackass took that title to make some James Bond ripoff movie couple of years ago.
*I have a feeling Jenna Ortega is gonna own 2022! 3 projects already and we haven't been in a quarter of this year. Unrelated but hope she does make a return on S4 of You.*
Hmm. 70s Throwback Gore. Love me some 70s Throwback Gore.
A24 got that vibe 👍🏾
What's that song in the trailer?
"If daddy catches us, there is no telling what he might do" - cut to slicing up a sausage. This gonna be good.
Mia goth looks like enya
I thought it was supposed to be an origin story for X-men.
Theres some sort of creature at 1:50
this trailer makes this movie visually looks like a horror movie, but the music makes it sounds like an action comedy
I’m tired of seeing that girl she is in everything
Ti west is a over rated director. Kid cudi can't act (the rest of the cast Is awful as well). What a dumpster fire
I love this type of era movies. I have to see this.
OST ?
Naked grandmas, my biggest fear is now a movie oh no
It's so funny that lot of people think this is a new x men movie Because of a title X but it's not
A24 always coming with interesting movies
Isn't this the same film location for Texas Chainsaw massacre?
Please tell me this will be streaming on shudder?
Banjos, need banjos
A24 NEVER LET YOU DOWN!!! I MISS 70'S SLASHER GENRES BRING IT ON!!!
i dont get how a24 keeps making each one of their movies great keep it up folks
🤮
KID CUDI
Yall over there at A24 are Straight WEIRDOS i did know if its a good or a bad thing
Kid cudi tryna makes us forget he wore them dresses 💀
Can't be worse than the abortion Dave grohl is putting out.
im kinda sick of the old lady dementia demon horror trope at this point bro
Glad they found another use for the music from Home Depot commercials. Edit: 1:50 for reference.
wheres hazbin hotel 🤨
Why do they show the entire plot in trailers?
LMAO I know this movie is gonna be ass just cause they shoved Hereditary on the trailer lit no other film from A24 since it has done that.
Ol' Cudi himself. Im in.
Why couldn't you just let the old people in the porno now they ded
Just showed us the entire movie 😂
This is giving me big "Taking of Deborah Logan" vibes
ugh
Wow they really took that "NEKKID GRANDMA" thing from Family Feud and made a movie out of it
Aoh wow!
Nothing about this trailer makes me want to see this film. What's scary about an old, frail lady?
Song name.
mia goth 😻
Mia Goth supremacy
Hope its good..I'm not intrigued yet
is it bad that i thought this had something to do with Xmen ?
GRANDMA DRIED APPLE HEAD
This looks like a refreshing take on horror.  :)
Thats clearly a woman in prosthetics,not a real old lady😂
These comments have to be bots. THIS looks “new, unique, innovative”? It looks ok but it also is very generic. City people drive to some secluded house in the middle of nowhere, have sex, and get killed by some crazy old white people……yea this has never been done before. What a unique and crazy premise for a movie 😂
Britanny snow looks amazing with that hair and style😍
Never understand the point of making disturbing horror movies.
Looks just cringe
Soooooooooooooo sundowners the movie?
Trailer should've endede at 1:07 and it would've been perfect. After that it gets too messy featuring too many spoilers.
Audibly said "oh no" when I read the words "...by the studio that brought you Hereditary"
Owen campbell you will always be famous
So it's about a porno crew who stays at a farm, turns out it's like "Eaten Alive" with a giant gator getting fed.
jenna ortega is becoming the new queen of horror oh wow. scream, wednesday, and now this. i'm super proud of her, she's so talented!
I Love A24
Jenna ortega is literally 19
I’m so excited for this to happen even after the trauma of my last A24 film (thanks midsommor!!)
Hey, this isn't a new X-Men movie
reminds me of "The Visit" but rated r lol
What is the Ozzy song in this trailer?
Who here can take out an 87lbs 89 year old woman. I think I can
Bruh straight up the name of this movie is "X" 💀
SCOTT!?
First there was Leatherface, then we had Blindface, now prepare for Senileface and his wife Dementiaface
cant believe XQC got his own movie.
vans and old isolated farmhouse are never a safe mix outside of scooby doo.
The director appears to be something of an auteur! His films, for the most part, are well-reviewed, if not well-received. He seems to have captured the tone of '70s exploitation film. Problem is, and this is a debatable point, I prefer the more authentic stationary use of the camera than the more nimble, contemporary cinematography on display here. And, of course, it's hard to achieve the look of 35mm on digital.
Now this is the oldschool horror I like
I see a classic coming.
This looks great
RESIDENT EVIL 7
Hell Yeah 👹🤘🤘
patiently waiting to never see this movie.
I'm calling it, Kid Cudi dies first.
Man, that trailer was too long and revealed too much. Studios really need to start cutting back on what they show.
Typical vile and debaucherous hollywood.
Oooooooo grindhouse-y.
I can't be the only one that thinks this looks so cheesy 💀
This film looks better scripted and produced than the latest Halloween movie.
I’m excited to see Scott. kid can act
This is not X-MEN >:(
God bless A24- keeping the horror game alive
Cudder!
A24 is becoming legendary in this world!! Very important studio.
Elements of "A Touch of Satan" in there, it seems like.
bruh this haircut of kid cudii
The trailer already ruined it for me. I'm hardcore betting the movie just completely changes halfway through 1:03
Gon give it to ya
This looks sick. Can't wait.
I’m definitly buying this on bluray if it’s good!
Oh hell yea. I love Britt. I love the aesthetic of this. Kinda porn meets Texas chain saw. Sign me uppppp
A24 never lets me down
Name of the song, please someone know it?
F*N LOVE IT
love it, gtz
I love how everyone in the comments are praising a24 like their the ones who actually created the movie. I love a24 but give some credit to Ti West
Who thought it was a good idea to shoot a porno on skinwalker ranch?
WHY DOES IT SOUND LIKE AN EPIC VERSION OF THE HOME DEPOT THEME?!?!
shit movie
I didnt realize that was Cudi till the end
You're going to see how many people wind up in prison because of this movie.... May these kinds of films end with this generation.... wasn't the first and third Texas chainsaw massacre films enough??
Is Jared Leto the creepy old lady?
Heavy Texas Chainsaw vibes.
This is gonna be the best Cudi music video
Saw this in the trailers before Scream 5! Can’t wait to watch it. Jenna Ortega is doing her thing!
Deborah Logan strikes again...
Ohhhhhh X Factor as in show biz and not mutant teenagers with claws and super healing
"from the studio that brought you Hereditary" a24 that's not really necessary
Porn and Horror. My two favorite things. Can't fucking wait.
who else thought the title was about Xmen
This is so 😎
I love A24 for always supporting the the principle of trying new ideas. Their films always has at least one unique aspect to it. What makes films a beautiful art is the ability to experiment with new stuff and I appreciate A24 for keeping that tradition alive!  Edit: I never nearly said anything that comes across as saying slasher movies are a new thing. I know the genre and I love it. Secondly, I never claimed that A24 is the holy grail of the movie industry, I just said that they are trying some new things out that I have yet to see from big budget Hollywood Studios. NOT THIS MOVIE IN PARTICULAR but generally the projects that they’ve done.
I can't say if this movie will be good or not, but this is how you make a trailer.
Love me some Brittany Snow!
A24 is the most reddit tier garbage ever. Just think about everyone who told you to watch Midsommar. I rest my case.
Lol I thought this was gonna be about daisy duke 😂
This trailer probably showed all that brother footage you know they the first to go
i'm liking all i've seen from ti west.
man when they gonna do something different, just looks like taking of deborah logan but in the 70s
Finally some that loooks scary let’s see if is not another funny shhh lol
im a simple man i see a24 horror i ask for 1 ticket
I was wondering, is there any jump scare in the movie?
cool cool thought was another chainsaw movie or something....but looks good.
A24 been making hella pornos lately
you got my interest
*sigh* we know who's dying first.
iM SO EXCITED FOR THIS
Is that…kid cudi….?
loving the visual homages to texas chainsaw massacre mmmm cant wait
Already Ben done
The thumbnail: when you realize they forget to add hot sauce to your taco bell meal
This is the most interestingly weird and confusing trailer I've seen this year. The gore, the implied storyline, the dialogue and the soundtrack are confusing me with no common horror vibes, but in a good and memorable way.
A24 is evolving
A twenty fucking four!!!!
jenna ortega is on her way to becoming a new hollywood starlet and i am so excited to see what's next for her. 2022 is her year.
Two thumbs down 👎👇
Kid cuddi?
thought this was going to be a new X-Men trailer
M. Night's movie The Visit??
It's looks so good
Why did the song turn into the Home Depot theme?
press f for people who clicked thinking it was an x men movie
horseshit movie
Dudes really know how to cut a Trailer, and the music damnnn, gut shit!!!
Why did that old man look like the man from poltergeist  with the black hat.
This looks absolutely mental, and I fucking love the fact Kid Cudi is in it! This is the kind of shit we want to see A24, no more horror movies about goats 🤮
"would you like to come inside?"...
Im getting tired of woke movies
Mia goth 💚
meh.
Babe wake up, new A24 movie trailer dropped
So old people are the new in?!
I don't understand this trope of old people being scary. I could totally kick thay old woman's ass. I could take that old man too....
A24 is really going downhill
CUDI AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Aff too many hetero sex scenes, soover having that shoved in our faces literally every single movie and tv series. Have more gay sex scenes!! It’s boring AF at this point and been done to death , mix it up and have more variety of characters ffs
"My wife is not okay.. it happens after dark" That is exactly like The Visit
Now that's creativity!
Damn after seeing those soft scene I knew A24 is R34 long lost brother.
We’ll see if they actually pull this off. I just doubt they will, but I’m hoping I’m wrong.
there are bad movies that are good and there are just bad ones.
*Sees mia goth*  *Sees "and the studio that brought you hereditary"*  I see where this is going.
Sick
What's that song in the background, is it custom theme song or is it actual song? It sounds great
What's that song in the background, is it custom theme song or is it actual song? It sounds great
A24 been working! 💪🏽
I love Mia Goth. This trailer is so good
More acting from Scott is always a good, no GREAT! Thing.
Jenna ouuu
Hype for this
A24 is a GOATED ass movie studio
Here I was thinking this was an x men movie lmao
A24 always with them bangers
For a second I thought it was another Tarantino movie. I miss porn of the 70s, before steroid actors and tattoo actresses performing so poorly you can't tell if sex is suppose to be pleasure or a fight.
Looks interesting. Love the 70's look!
i can’t wait for this movie ugh i’m obsessed
Song?
This is going to be good
This movie probably would benefit from a trailer that showed less.
X 222 369
This has the potential to be the newest cult classic of our era if done right!
Wait, were supposed to be scared of an old lady?
HELL YEAH.  I LIKE IT!!!!
gross
the jenna ortega screaming scene alone is enough to make me wanna watch it
Can't wait--Absolutely love A24 and can't wait to see how this one comes out!!
I really like A24. But I’m not sure about this one. All the sex. I don’t care for that kind of stuff in movies.
She couldn't resist the black cobra
A24 putting out another good one from the trailer.
what's the trailer song?
X GONNA GIVE IT TO YA
old people are scary
Still waiting for Brittany Snow to get her Oscar.
Kid Cudi in this movie? Les go
what song is that in the begining
Is that the girl from the Disney channel??? Wtf my daughter used to watch her show lol oh hell naww
Jenna Ortega in her bag OKAY!!!!!!
interesting cast
Looks F-d up and stylish. Can't wait :D
Kid Cudi looking like Jimi Hendrix In this shit . A24 BETTER REALIZE WHAT THEY CAN DO
90 percent of this trailer is original Texas Chain Saw Massacre
This looks wack
The House of the Devil is one of my fave movies ever so very excited for this!!!
.
I love A24
This setup feels like it could easily be a comedy horror.  Have no idea if it will be or not
I saw Texas Chainsaw massacre evil dead and village of the damnd in this trailer
It seem like it’s got Russ Meyer vibes, I dig it! Looks awesome
You had me at “the studio that brought you Hereditary” 😌
Looks incredibly cheesy
This will be REAL easy to find outside cinema. Weird choice though with a blacksploitation '970s style, filming a film about filming some porn...
As much as I liked the trailer I don't think ill actually enjoy the movie.
It never makes sense to me to have elderly old people be the scary villains, like just give them a decent push and they'll fall over and bust a hip,or avoid them all together by running at a decent jog.
I hope he has a good ending with this.  It's one thing that really bugs me with his movies.  He will have this absolutely fantastic and atmospheric build to get it going but then it falls flat or self destructs at the end like it did with "The Innkeepers."
Good God the trailer formula here is overwhelmingly cliche.
I don't know guys. Love the camera work etc but I'm worried about the pro porn vibe. Porn is bad mmkay
I HAD NO CLUE THAT WAS KID CUDI UNTIL THE END THEN I HAD TO RE-WATCH. This trailer came out on b-day, cool present.
I'm not sure I feel great about this new X-Men reboot.
Jenna Ortega must be gunning for the official new age scream queen title for this generation
Man, A24 is killing it with the original ideas. It's a little on the nose, but it's a twist you can't help but be intrigued by. Being A24 there's probably more to it than the trailer shows as well. Or, at least, that usually seems to be the case. Looks interesting.
If you have not seen other Ti West films, do yourself a favor...House of the Devil is top notch
I mean something new for the next generation I guess but there's absolutely nothing interesting about this if you've already seen any of the 10's of 1000's of scary hick movies that already exist. Looks like literally nothing here on offer but higher production value but since I've seen this story perhaps over a 100 times already, hard pass. I mean it could be an objectively excellent movie and it would still have no place in my life based on this premise alone. No.
wear wolfs cool
I'm watching the hell out of this.
Anyone else tired of the "old people are scary" trope? A brisk wind can push them over and they're no longer a threat. I hope there's a lot more to this story than a bunch of pushover actors in the prime of their youth being picked off by queen Elizabeth.
One thing for sure about this horror film...the black dude isn't going to make it.
I'm just happy that kid Cudi in this
Discount Matthew McConaughey
Black dies first by getting his soul sucked out of him...   free gums, amazing hugs!
Looks really cool! 70s horror for sure! I do wish it had a better title but meh. Looks good 👍
I really love A24, they put out quality and this trailer definitely has my interest...will watch!
I thought It was a movie of x23
Looks like he took elements of how TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE (1974) was shot mixed, except they are shooting some kind of softcore I guess, then horror/supernatural stuff happens while they are shooting it like the 1974 horror film THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN CORPSES.  Oh, and the song is called "I Just Wanna Make Love to You" by Foghat (1972.)
Okay Scott Mescudi. Definitely watching this.
I love the idea and trailer... but goddamn... I need the name of this SONG
Jenna Ortega gets to be a proper final girl now!
I wanna see this...
IS THAT KID CUDI??
Jenna Ortega fans this is our time to shine!!!!
Name of the song?
Anyone says SHEITAN ?
JENNA ORTEGA UP NEXT! Mark my words.
Song name?
Naw Im good, its semen retention for me Have to stay in Higher energy, This low level shit not happening in 2022.
Yes Lawd
Now that's how you make a trailer
Too many jumpscares in a trailer. I def gon' watch it.
This looks very intriguing.
Surprised trailer 3star vs excellent movie horror 5star 🙄🙄🙄
This X-men reboot certainly seems to be trying something new.
You son of a b, I'm in.
Гиде это пасмареть?
Omg Britney Snow is back!!!
Very Texas-chainsaw-massacre type vibes ngl kinda quirky
Take it this isn't an X-Men movie
MR RAGER IS BACK BABYYYY
Texas chainsaw x the visit = a good time
Look at Cudi man, inspirational
Here I was thinking there was a marvel movie that I never heard of.... I am pleasantly surprised nonetheless
Amazing trailer
X
Is Denzel Washington the policeman at the end of the video?
JENNA ORTEGA IS IN EVERYTHING NOW I love itt
Am i the only one who thought for 1 microsecond that this was a new X-Men movie based on the title?
Mia goth is so fucking gorgeous damn
Cudi goin day n night
Anything A24 does is amazing
ok, this is the ultimate representation of cringe and unnecessary XXX scenes in every dumb low budget horror movie!
A24 fans when the
I actually thought this was a Texas Chainsaw Masacre movie lol. But it looks good so far.
xqcL
LMAO bot comments
ZooWeeMama!
det wahmen was in ma bed tooching meehhhh
I’m getting Texas Chainsaw,Boogie Nights,and Don’t Scream vibes from this
now, this is how you make a trailer.
Looks trash, respectfully.
Waiting for Oscar announce this as the best picture.
Oh man... This looks like a doozy!  To be rurally projected outdoors @ hot summer night.
It reminds me of M. Nights The Visit in theme
this is way better than another super hero crap movie
“The story can’t just change midway through.” Justice league: *laughs nervously*
Giving me Resident Evil 7 with that A24 flair 💖💖
okay now miss ortega slowly becoming a scream queen. i live ☺️☺️
ayeee kid cudi
The timeline in these X-men movies keeps getting harder to follow
oh hell yeah
I was watching Scream 5 with my friend recently in the theatre. After the movie, he was a fan of it and I personally thought it wasn’t anything great.  During the previews, we were watching the previews and discussing what looked good. I remember not caring about the preview movies to much but then this came on. I said this movie looked incredible while we refilled our slushees and he said it looked like shit. I think that says a lot about who we are as people.
looks great actually
This actually looks creepy weird, old and good!
this looks SO SICK
This trailer didn’t really do it for me
I literally thought this was an older movie in the first few secs of the preview till I recognized mia goth, so glad she's in more movies!!
This looks fantastic, but I can't help it:    The exterior set look exactly like Schrute Farms.
I’m trying to see kid cudi acting in this
Honestly i feel like i just watched the whole movie...
this looks really dumb. so a bunch of healthy young people in their 20s and 30s are afraid of an old lady night after night? ok
*CUDI* 😩👌🏽
Kid Cudi looks amazing
Scott Mescudi is looking pretty good
a 70s p*rno horror flick? probably shouldn't go see this one with the family.
The moment I saw A24, I started waiting for the "Le shit, Le fan" moment... They never disappoint.
XD
Old lady's terrifying
I too am an A24 Stan. And I am not ashamed at all to admit it. So many good films. I thinks I’ve only not seen 2-3 of their whole collection. I go on their site to see if I’ve missed any.  Green knight is one.
The old lady looks almost identical to the grandma in The Taking of Deborah Logan.
Great trailer, didn't show all the kill shots, saved the gore for the movie. I'm intrigued
R-rated version of M night's The Visit? hell yeah!
I love A24 but idk, this looks derivative and exploitative sexually. Not my Thang yall. Lol
WOW AMAZING ANOTHER CRAP FILM IM GAGGING TO WATCH
lol you already know cudi getting merked first
A24 is going to eat everyone else's lunch. Disney, Netflix, Apple, etc... wish they could be A24.
Finally an X23 movie
I'm loving Jenna Ortega not being seen as a disney kids anymore.
looks awesome
Im stoked. A24 is always good stuff. You guys showed too much though. The logo would have sufficed lmao
Honestly thought this was gonna be a movie trailer for x 24 Logan's daughter cuz I saw x and 24, but u know this works too
A24 - Take my money!
Hyped af for Kid Cudi tbh
Ok im hype
jesus
Does anyone's know the name of the song?
For a while I kept on thinking this was some different take on teXas Chainsaw...
Cool... more torture porn. NEXT!  Bring back Hostel and more August Underground movies if this is what people want. LAMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
In A24 i trust!!
Cringe
eh
Kid cudi looks so good in this movie
looks like this was shot perfectly
Y
X gon give to ya
Everyone saying how unique and good it looks but I'm doubtful.
Looks like The Visit meets Deepthroat
This trailer did it all for me. I'm in.
Wow X-Men has gotten weird ever since Disney got them back
this could be the masterpiece A24 made after midsommer
aw man i thought this was a new X-men movie
A24 is great.  No woke shit.  All legit original movies.
So no-one with any kind of a famous name in a movie put out by a company that does quality work where the usual sex trope is front n center but with a crazy half Debra Logan/Unnamable mashup as the horror creature? Goooo Onnnnnnn.
Ok nice one
ok im in looks fun
nice 👍🏻
only care bc mia goth
Saw this trailer while watching scream and was hype to see my boy kid cudi
CUDDIIII OMGG
I've seen enough Ti West films to know that he's all style and no substance. And judging from this trailer I can tell he has nothing spectacular to show yet again.
Is this movie related to The Visit at all? This could be a prequel to that movie.
Glad of them to find a really good Matthe McCounaghey impersonator.
how many times are we gonna recreate this Texas Chainsaw situation?
A24 rarely misses
After seeing The Witch and Hereditary, I vowed to be an A24 fan for life Then after seeing Midsommar, I vowed to watch their movies alone before taking anyone else to see them
Yep!
😴
Gayy
As soon as you see "A24", think: Here comes something effed up. THAT'S brand identity. Also, I make sure not to see it.
I wish composers would return to crafting their own unique sounds for movies. This whole business of making a movie score out of a popular song from the time is silly asf and it doesn’t even sound good. A24 takes a step forward with story and cinematography, but the soundtracks always leave something to be desired.
This looks totally wrong, but in a good effed up way.
I almost didn't even recognize Brittany! Wow. This looks good!!
Wait this isn’t X-men?
This actually looks tight
Well this looks intense!
CUDDER
Cannnot wait for its sequel A and its Prequel called D!
"you know wah?"  "wah?"
God, I was born for movies like these! Thank you A24 for satisfying my soul😍😍
Brittant Snow + Jenna in one movie??? YES PLS 👏🏻
i want ari aster + A24
Tarantino already did the Grindhouse thing back in '07.
Damn, that Foghat hits hard as hell.
I don't like this trailer but it looks like a unique movie so I am going to watch it.
ctrl c ctrl v
70's porn and horror all in one!?
looks fun, I like Mia Goth and horror so looks great!
Next favorite movie I’m calling it, Cudder the god, Brytney I think of you but I do not love you
I'll wait for it to be streaming.
Seems awesome👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
The visit with porn...
So an old lady is the killer?
If anybody could tell me what song is in this trailer I would very much appreciate it :)
The only hollywood movie worth watching are from A24.
Lol is that kid cudi?
The location took me back to the original texas chainsaw
I swear to god i thought he was Matthew McConaughey lol
As they do not fulfill the cliché of who should die first.  It will be a decent movie but propaganda of what is now fashionable
they go to hollywood and the horror begins
Wow.  Lots of overhyped, strange comments below.  Glowing praise for your run-of-the-mill horror movie trailer with jump scares. Highly suspicious.  Wonder if this studio pays for bot comments from fake users and manipulates YT for fake views?
that thumb nail !! yeah I am scared of the letter  X also lady lol
Like resident evil 7
If "Dazed & Confused" was a Horror Movie: this could be it. 🎬Automatic Watch ✌🏼
scott mescudi 😎
Is the old lady supposed to be the scary thing?
I swear Jenna Ortega is in everything right now
I never thought I would see Harley Diaz colonize the Horror genre 💀
Cool, thanks trailer, now I know the entire plot and don’t have to watch the movie. 👍🏻
Wait, how did Deborah Logan get there?
These trailers are too dam long for their own good
Not gonna lie, Kid Cudi can be a damn good actor
Ti West makes a good looking movie. My issue is that aren't very good.
X gonna give it to ya
Horror Movies: It's either a strong man in his 30's or an old woman in her 80's
1:48 JENNA ORTEGAAAAAAAAAA
Prolly Black dude dies first.
0:36 i Quit the tráiler cause something i learn is. Yo wanna see a A24 movie? Cool here is my advice, the less you know the Better,im sure this one will not dissapoint,love you A24!  🔥🖤
clearly this was meant for the people who know of the "kid cudi" character or rapper or singer no idea who any of the actors are,  the premise seems pretty weetarded,  like old granny with dementia ?  LMAO k writing seems pretty meh,  A24 has never made a crap product right ?  well they certainly made a crap trailer then
What in the sam hell did I just watch?
Kid Cudi, that is all.
I remember when I first saw Spring Breakers back in 2013, and I just caught Gucci Mane sleepin' during the sex scene. And then I just saw Uncut Gems back in 2019, and Julia Fox is the most hot-ass, sexy-ass actress I've ever fuckin' seen. I'm a huge fan of A24, home of the real-ass indie flicks, and to be honest, that entertainment company is the muthafuckin' shit. It was way more better than every mainstream movie studio in Hollywood, and A24 is fully independent, cause it's better be fuckin' good!
IM HERE FOR THIS!!!
What is the name of this song?
A24 should be the ones making Texas Chainsaw Massacre sequels
1:25 nice!
M E H
Is like km 666?
I swear Jenna Ortega can get it
Exactly the feel I want Tarantino to do for his last film!! Can’t wait for this to release!
You can always count on A24 to deliver <3
Had me at cudi
Really weird seeing an original concept these days, also Jenna Ortega is knocking it out of the park with her carrier
A24 cannot miss!
oh an a24 slasher. im w it
so this looks amazing
the real horror is how few people are mentioning Kid Cudi acting, aren't you guys excited?
If you didn’t know by now, Ti West is a living legend!! His filmography is golden! Check out all his films if you haven’t already
What song is used in this trailer?
2:20 promote the movie in the movie, that's a f*cking genius marketing move.
Wtf is this
yo kid cudi
i thought that was kid cudi
EXCITED MAN CUDI IS GONNA DO AMAZING
I thought it was logans daughter
Getting TCM vibes. In fact I think that was the same house.
From the director of Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever “Ti West”
Thumbnail: 🙀🙀
DAMN IS SHE SINGLE
This looks intriguing but if this is supposed to be a horror movie, they chose the wrong music for the trailer
Is this the film that was recorded in New Zealand?
WOAH! I thought this was gonna be like some...Boogie Nights 2 type of movie, but I was....Yeah- I guess I was wrong 😳
Oh boy, killer Granny. Love A24 but the psycho grannies are always hard to make believable but this studio never misses. Can't wait to see how they screw with our brains this time.
That poor old lesbian woman doesn't deserve to be treated like a monster 😂😂
SCOTT MASCUDI aka KID CUDI??!? I knew it was him! lol he a bad boy for this one! Granny is comin' fo dat ass!
Holy heck! That farmers lady looks like Deborah Logan!
How did we get so lucky to get A24? They have the vision and conviction to give us amazing content after amazing content. I hope Hollywood takes notes. Every boardroom exec that shoots something down for lack of mass appeal needs to stop treating us like children. This is what we want! Go A24!!
This has nothing to do with spaceships.
Why am I getting like basic ass scary movie vibes.. like 30 mins of sex scenes and then shitty deaths.. idk this trailer was weird , dont get me wrong its filmed incredibly well but I hope it's not ass
Did they just copy and paste "Texas Chainsaw Massacre"?
may have some potential.
Ms Ortega!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU GET THAT MONEY GIRL!!!!
Is she a vampire or a werewolf what the f*** is she it looks pretty cool I know the soundtrack is going to be awesome
I'm not gonna lie this doesn't look that good
They are really weird in a good way.
Foghat will always pull me in to whatever video
Wow finally a unique original movie! 😍🔥🔥 no bs remakes
-A24 -Horror/Gore -Pervy This will be Jay Bauman's all-time favorite movie.
Here I was thinking Mia Goth's character wasnt going to die a horrible death ...but then I saw the whole trailer 😭
cant understand this trailer
the song is 'I Just Want to Make Love to You' - Foghat cover. you're welcome took me long enough to find that shit lmao
I love the editing and graphics in this trailer. Looks very confident in it's style
Looks good............cant wait!
imma be honest, lookin kina whack
Oooh this film definitely ooozin with 70's groove, can ya dig it?
I thought it was an X Men movie 🤣🤣
Damn once she got on the scream movie they had Jenna Ortega on every movie now she’s a very good actor n she’s beautiful
I love the Grindhouse, 16mm look the movie seems to have. Even in the digital shots - it looks to be lit and filtered in a way that mimics that old style. But almost in a meta-sort-way. Like death proof and planet terror! I’m excited for this one.
Thank Satan for A24. No one in cinema shows the horrors of sex and greed better than them.
Lol here I thought A24 just made an X-Men movie
Jenna finally moved on from Disney
im here for jenna ortega
KID CUDI IN AN A24 HORROR/SLASHER FILM I CAN FUCKING DIE HAPPY WTF
I love the X men!
hahaha i like this can’t wait 😝
Flop
Wow Jenna Ortega is in everything right now
Lmao why is nobody talking about Kid Cudi being in the movie
Can’t wait for this movie to just be a metaphor for something.
Kid Cudi making moves! Love to see it!
I love the how back in the 80’s film had the gritty look. I think it immerses  you more, because it’s like a dream. Real, yet like a memory. Hope this turns out good.
Everyone taking about Jenna whoever and no one’s gonna mention kid cudi??
A24 makes some amazing movies. This looks really good
Does anyone know the song name?
Bless everyone at A24.
This looks so lame
Zzzzz
Nah but they really really don’t miss , one of my favorite fasho
I see A24, I know it's gonna be a banger
Damn, I thought this was a x men reboot...i was sooooo wrong....
X gonna give it to ya
Bring back Adam Sandler
Uncut Gems
Will this be in any xtream? Please let me know
Brittany Snow is so sexy
Cudi
A24 out here saving cinema! Just when you think Hollywood is talentless and out of ideas, A24 comes out of nowhere with a banger
Naked old people is the lifeblood for A24 films.
The trailer isn’t grabbing me. But a24 hasn’t disappointed me yet so gotta watch this
I am definitely seeing this masterpiece . It gave me a boogie nights vibe that turned into texas chainsaw massacre real quick from just the previews I can say it’s something fresh finally because I was getting tired of seeing remakes that don’t meet the standards or surpass the original. Can’t wait in till it’s out
KID CUDI??? IN AN A24 MOVIE????? AMEN
Meh
Idk why but I can’t like Jenna Ortega . She gives me that dumb loud chick lol
“I have a strange weakness for criminals and artists. Both do not accept life as it is. Every sad story must be in conflict with real-life events."
All i ask is that they don’t kill kid cudi
I was not expecting an TCM styled A24 slasher and now I am very excited
yesss
_probably shoulda worn the fuckin' pants_
Song?
My boi kid cudi getting more and more into acting
looked at the thumbnail and thought: this smells like Ari Aster...
Yes Jenna Ortega our modern Scream Queen!
I'm calling it right now, the sequel will be XX and the threequel, XXX.
The old guy look like grampa in chainsaw massacre
Is that a fake Matthew mcconaughey
Bestiality is still taboo and gross AF 🤢🤮 Dislike
algun dia haran trailers sin contarte la peli
Excited. Ti West is a great horror director.
IFC > A24
It’s an A24 movie, shut up and take my money already.
I get so hyped when I see A24
Nekid old woman running around? Im out.
you had me at A24
The best thing Ti West's career was his death in You're Next. Him and his little "mumble horror" buddies are hacks... idk why studios keep giving them chances. Even Wingward isn't that great.
If you here for kid cudi like this
Interesting.
jenny ortega is the new scream queen!!
So basically Texas Chainsaw Massacre the porn parody?  Sold!  I am pre-ordering tickets to this film
Creepy!
This is such a unique concept
Looks original compared to what I've been seeing lately
A24 I love you
A24 is making pure art with these films. Especially the period pieces. They put so much care and detail into them that it just makes for an overall wonderful experience
Nasty
I wasnt that moved by the trailer until i saw the guys from hereditary made this.. you know its gonna b good
Studio 777
A24 always a step ahead
this be bussin'
This looks like popcorn jumpscare horror flick done right. Haven't seen a decent one since The Cabin In the Woods
Scott Mescudi is the man on the Moon
Nice never seen Mathew McConaughey in a horror
Great cast, great talent behind the camera and a very good trailer, I'm excited, keep up the good work A24!
I'll watch anything with Owen Campbell (the guy with long hair and glasses) hes super underated and doesn't get enough lead roles. Check out Super Dark Times, My Heart Can't Beat Unless you Tell It Too (vampire movie, but original) and As You Are for a couple he was the lead in. Amazing actor.
at this point all im ever looking forward to seeing are a24 movies
Oh this looks AMAZING!
The quality from A24 is really off the charts. The camera works, the visual, cinematography, everything is just beyond great.
texas chainsaw vibe much
Damn, are you telling me I could look at Kid Cudi's pp in this movie??? 😳😳😳 SIGN ME UP!
Music is Foghat - I Just Want To Make Love To You
Kid cudi doing his thing 😊
So horror with some Pron added in ?  Also did she just rip that man's D off !!?
I like the vibe of this !  Brings chills even from the  trailer
Jenna is the next Zendaya
oh well, I think I saw the entire movie already... just my thoughts
Kntot
The music! Whose the artist behind this hypnotizing theme?
omg mia goth???
Lame
This movie about to be dumb as hell, you are telling me a group of middle aged people get soloed by an old lady with creaky bones?
definitely watching this!
Kid Cudi!!!
ti west.  I love you  you got me into filmmaking
Not gonna lie, this looks interesting
Salutations A24 Like your work, I’ve noticed that you picked up Hazbin hotel for Television, screamed in joy liek when we found out Doctor Octopus and Green goblin were gonna be in Spider-Man No way home) I was wondering when is it gonna premiere? I don’t mind waiting some more art takes time however would like more detail.
yes
I wonder why the title of the film is only ‘X’ and nothing more to that. The visuals already got me hooked.
This looks good! Kid Cudi as a main character as well it’s a must see!
WILLAYYYYYY
Looking forward to see this movie 👀
You can see the obvious racial angle coming a mile away, you'd almost think Peele directed it. (That's until you see the terrific visuals and real horror violence you'd expect. )
Song??
this is definitely gonna give me fucking jump scares and i'm looking forward to it. Amazing
A24, single-handedly saving the film industry.
MIA F*CKIN GOTH......TAKE MY MONEY PLEASE!  YA ,this looks good.
Anybody else thought Leatherface was going to pop out?
Damn. The one actress Jenna is starting to be everywhere all at once. That’s crazy
bro this look bad
❤️❤️❤️❤️🤲🏾🤲🏾🤲🏾🤲🏾 A new original horror movie!!!! I’m so Excited to see this
Kid Cudi in an A24 horror. Count me in
Basically it's about human meat and cannibalism.
Jenna Ortega better be the final girl!
KID CUDI!!!!
man it’s great to see a horror movie not afraid to tread new ground and deal with the idea that sex is naughty and secret and older folks are gonna punish it. really a taboo, especially in horror always afraid to show lusty vixens being menaced by, get this, unsexy folks. horror movies are always doing this “oh we’re all sexually liberated and sex is no big deal and the killer goes after like, people with too many piercings” and finally we’re getting a movie about sexual anxiety. i’ve always thought a knife would be a good phallic symbol, but idk if they’re willing to be that bold and avant gard
This movie is a hard pass for me I think Jenna Ortega is good in horror movies loved her in The Babysitter sequel and Scream (2022) but having this feeble old woman be the killer. It just pulls me out of any possible outcome of seeing this movie at the very least she looks to be in her 80s how could she possibly overpower someone in their 20s or even 30s?
Mia Goth has such a 70s face, even in the new Suspiria I was like "did they pluck this woman from a Zeffirelli movie or something"
Looks like.... The Taking of Deborah Logan, Boogie Nights, mixed w the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, sprinkled with that indescribable A24 weird a** magic. - plus anything w Mia Goth is amazing (aka. ✅ Yes pLease)
What a clever twist on the genre! Looks interesting.
Anyone know the song they used?
Love A24, but his casting is getting a little sus… needs to diversify the main characters.
The Black Guy dies first lol.
Anyone know the song in the trailer?
Why isn’t anyone talking about Kid Cudi being in this film?!? Can’t wait for this one!
Gotta be a joke!!
i thought it was x-MEN
I like 70s retro but seems abit try hard...yet since it's Ti West w/A24, then I'll still try it out. I really hope it's more high tension build up than devil's rejects dumb script tho
This looks dope
Jenna Ortega had been in her bag lately 2022 is her year
Me and my girl been A24 fans since TUSK they just keep getting better & better
Wow. An actual movie.
Soundtrack sounds great. LOVE Jenna Ortega. Hope it’s not awk watching with my mom lmao
Saw this in an early screening a few mo ths ago! Fucking wild movie, not sure that I mean that in a good way. I love A24 movies, but this one was a miss for me. I can't wait to see everybody's takes on it when it comes out tho!
A24 is the best movie production company out right now
kiiiiddd cuuuddiiii
X from mega man
Old people scare me all the time, how they can leave their teeth in a  glass and than magically place it back into their mouth. Horrible creatures these senior citizens.
Does anyone know the song that plays in the traliet ?!?!
Why is no one talking about Kid Cudi playing a main role in this?!
This girl was just in Scream.
Glad to see Cudi getting a bigger role
Kid cudi huh
If Cudi dies first I’ll be extremely mad
What  a premise!
Looks great, but i would've went with a different choice of music to create proper dread.. I get the 70s vibe...
Looks great, actually. Big fan of A24's horror films.
1:40 that transition was so smooth
Kinda like a inspirational soft reboot of a certain Rob Zombie movie or at least the vibe of the trailer makes me think of such lol
When I first saw this trailer in theatres I thought it was Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Boy was I wrong there.
wait kid cudi??
We all agree this trailer is amazing! Now what’s the song called?? 😅😅😅
Gon give it to ya?
Why I gotta wait a month and a half? I want to see this now!
Brittany Snow and Jenna Ortega?! That alone makes me excited for this movie This movie looks incredible
What a combo..... A24 and Sir Cudi
X is finally done with GTA RP
Wow! That is awesome!
🖤‼️‼️
A24 doesn't miss. And Kid Cudi is in this?! I'm soooo down! 🙌🏿 he better not die first though 😤
Holy shit is that kid cudi
I don't know what I just saw, but it looks very unique. It's either going to be a cult classic or a failed experiment. Managing pacing in this kind of movie can't be easy.
in A24 We Trust
Dude is straight up doing a matthew mcconaughey impression from dazed and confused
Thx for spoiling the whole ass movie💀💀💀💀
Getting Texas Chainsaw Massacre vides.
Mia Goth was great in the 2020 version of "Emma."  I am looking forward to see what she does here.
What song is playing in the trailer??
As soon as I see A24, I know it’s going to be interesting and good. I definitely wasn’t disappointed
thats what happen when you have sex outside of marriage boys. Stay pure
the way i didn’t realize that was kid cudi 😭😭😭😭
you guys are making such great concept movies.. waiting for this new masterpiece 🔥
Oh i want to watch this.
This director had a long history of garbage films and im surprised A24 is involved with him. This trailer looks like your average horror movie and just as unremarkable as the director's previous works... just slightly masked by A24's standards. I'll wait for reviews on this one.   People are probably gonna watch it because of Kid Cudi.
Yeah Scott !
A24 loves scary old people
I guess that old mans wife Pearl is gonna give their horror movie that X factor
Yo it's Cudi!!!
i dont think simon cowell would give her the x factor unless hes allowed to give her the D factor first HAHAHA
I saw this on the home page and I had to click on it. No recitation.
I thought that was Mathew McConaughey but it's Martin Henderson, he doesn't even get a name credit>????? He's a well-known tv and film actor for the past 25 years lol wot
The director's early life section is sparse, but... you can just tell.
Take my money!!!
What in the Boogie Nights Friday the 13th is this?
What in the Boogie Nights Friday the 13th is this?
Seeing Ti west's name makes me excited!
this looks stylishly dumb
I can't wait.
Song please ?
I......I..... don't even know what to say.......🤷‍♂️
Looks AMAZING
Kid Cudi's getting major studio roles nowadays and I love it
OMG
Kid Cudi is making moves
Cudiiii
Kid Cudi really trying to branch out into movies
Whats the song playing?
Love from India ❤️
Okay now I have to watch The House of the Devil again
Lmfao blacked the horror movie
seeing Kid Cudi in more movies is literally the highlight of my year so far
Mia Goth is so underrated.
BUENISIMA
Rob Zombie should’ve directed this.
I can't wait to see it even though I'm a little scared.
Scott Mescudi? Cool 😎
God, Jenna Ortega is becoming one of my favorite actresses.. I'll watch anything if she's in it!
So their filming a porno?
Its Amazing that Ti West come back! remember yet the house of devil and giving me chills
The people behind these movies don’t hold nothing back it’s not even sublime anymore
I saw Kid Cudi in a movie by the same people who gave us Moonlight 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Anyone know the name of the song in this trailer? It's on the tip of my brain but can't figure it out.
First i thought, this is about controversial animal farm videos..
KID CUDI TOO???!!!!
BRITTANY SNOW YES!!!!! been missing her from the horror genre... <3 <3 <3 A24 always killin it!!
2022 is def gonna be jenna's year
Kinda has a Grindhouse feel...
THIS is what a trailer should be! Gets you interested and leaves you wondering what the actual fck you just watched lmfaooo!
Damn A24 you're bold!!! please, let me work with you <3<3<3
Mia Goth u genius u
Holy shit man its Kid Cudi wtf
It looks like a classic already.
This going to blow up the box office
A24 films are so weird but great
JENNA GET BEHIND ME
Cannot wait for this Jenna Ortega is our new scream queen honestly ♥️♥️🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Dose everyone wat a name of this X movie so I can find it on prime videos
am i crazy or does this just look astonishingly lame, like even for an A24 movie
So texas chainsaw massacre meets the strangers huh
Kid Cudi!!!
Damn I didn’t even recognize kid cudi!
1:49 so dude's got a crocodile in the basement like in Tobe Hooper's *Eaten Alive*?  and man Jenna Ortega blew me away in Scream, can't wait to see her shine here too, she's a scream queen already
Brittany Snow is so hot. Seems a bit comedic but I’ll give it a shot when it comes out.
horrible trailer imo
A24 is for people who love the ART of filmmaking.
I stopped watching the trailer halfway through. Not cuz I was offended or anything. It's cuz A24 keeps knocking it out of the park.  If its an A24 movie Ill watch it.
This is such a great trailer! I’m hyped. Does anyone know what song they’re using?
The Chelsea Wolfe soundtrack is the most interesting part to me
It’s so daunting to see how far A24 has come, the quality is crazy now
This actually looks good and the cast
Granny 🤗
The creepy naked old lady just like in The Taking of Deborah Logan
did i see kid cudi👁👄👁
Ti West!
I really apricate what A24 does for film. Its never just cut and past movies they make something to look forward too.
WTF with all the bots in the comments.
BYE THIS IS SO GOOD
Reminds me of cabin in the woods with all the horror tropes. Love the nostalgic aesthetic of this one.
This looks like a Lana Del Rey music video
Cudi better not die
yayyy owen campbell!!!!!
I LOVE A24
Can’t wait to see this movie 🍿
I’m down
I feel like this movie will keep you up at night after watching it
Seems awesome
It’s been awhile since I have felt a film was FRESH and I’d say this one is giving me FRESH 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
This looks fantastic.
This movie is weird af. This ain't a A24 movie for sure
jenna ortega. That is all
Finally a horror movie done right! I hope to see more movies like this all year.
This looks and feels like House of 1000 Corpses. That movie messed me up.
I was waiting for leatherface to come out. But the movies looks good.
kid cudi is scott mescudi and scott mescudi is the goat
Is A24 the best movie company right now? They remind me of Miramax back in the day. Wasnt afraid to put out something different.
A24 is life.
I was like “oh is this a movie about filming porn in the 70?”, then I was remembered it’s an A24 movie. Nothing is ever as it seems 😂
I'm going to be upsetty if I watch this and you fucks ended up putting the ending in the trailer (scene with the cops)
Ti West working with A24. Rad. Also, love to see Kid Cudi.
Absolute trash
Boogie nights meets hereditary huh?
Almost look like the Texas chainsaw. This is a must see.
Sign. Me. Up.
It looks like a remake of something
Crazy watching Jenna Ortega on Disney and now she’s in a A24 movie can’t wait to see more of her projects in the future
Omg this is such a cool vibe id watch this
Every A24 film I know about is a psychological thriller or horror
A24 is one of the few things getting me through this pandemic with any semblance of sanity
yes jenna
ti west dosent make bad movies im hyped
Jeez, even the trailer is creepy AF
This looks horrible beyond belief. Whey they bragged it was from the people who made Hereditary, that was a big red flag right there. Horror films used to be thrillers. Now they are just cheap gore fests where everyone dies at the end.
Damn, that guy with the glasses and long hair looked familiar, it’s Owen Campbell! An up and coming actor who is very good. Everybody who’s a fan of A24 should go check out the movie “Super Dark Times” (2017) by Kevin Phillips. A24 fans will love it! It’s highly underrated and very reminiscent of Gus Van Sant films. Oh and super excited to see Ti West back in his groove :)
Seeing a lot of comments about it looking like a Texas chainsaw massacre film, but I was thinking maybe a werewolf??
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSS SO EXCITED
Wrong turn vive
Filmed in Whanganui haha.
first A24 movie that is not slow?
Boogie Nights, but it’s slasher film.
Gee thanks for giving away the entire freaking plot. Might've been interesting but I've already seen the movie now. Need to fire whoever made that trailer.
A24 has the best cinematography.
Filmed in Whangarei!
look at this hipster shit. look at it!
1:50 Wtf was that
A24?! 70s?! Scott?! And Brit?!  Oh this goin be GOODT.
Thank you A24!!!!!
Since Hereditary, Im obsessed with A24...this shit transcends time!!!
Definitely feels like Boogie Nights meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I'm here for it.
definitly too scary for me but yall enjoy.
Jenna Ortega is going to be the next big actress, she's been good in everything she's been in, glad to see her getting that recognittion, can't wait to see this.
Jenna Ortega becoming the next Scream Queen 🤔
Looks very interesting.
Old lady in the walls
Can’t believe a24 is doing the next x men movie
this looks like it will be stressful af to watch
Nobody gonna talk about kid cudi being in this ?
I’m calling it right now, the old lady is a succubus.
Sooooo you’re telling me this old ass lady is going to kill a bunch of people 🤦🏾‍♂️
These trailers show the whole movie. WHY?!
I guess Jenna Ortega is going to be this generation scream Queen.
PLEASE! When in Italy?
Looks AWESOME
so much talent crammed in one space, yes please!
I love A24 films. Sooooo refreshing.
Maaaaan! instant hype. Love the 70's aesthetic, looks really good.
Brittany Snow doing interracial porn  is totally believable.
I thought for a second it was another reboot of the chainsaw massacre
Kid cudi and horror I'm in
Ti west is back bitch!
Texas chainsaw had a baby with boogie nights
As long as the mud shark bites the dust, I might watch it.
Why’s no one talking about how beautiful Brittany Shaw is?!?!?!!
Really? A24 is going to sht. They combined the “young ppl fkn in a cabin not knowing a killer is nearby” and “The Visit” a horror movie about old people and sun downing.   Predictable and boring
Song name anyone?
This Shit Looks Garbage💯
Missed an opportunity to call it “Oogie Boogie Nights”
To whoever is reading this : May God bless you ! You’re gunna do great for ur school year ! Put God first and everything will fall into place ! John 3:16 says , “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life!!!!. “ 💕💕💕💕
I need to mark this down my calendar!!!!!
So no one one is gonna mention how they put the whole movie in the trailer...?
I really thought this was gonna be another Texas chainsaw reboot until I saw the Wife! Now very intrigued
Finally something original taking it back to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre days. Always loved Brittany Snow and finally she's gonna be in some hot sex scenes and even Jenna Ortega who's becoming a rising horror scream queen after just starring In the new Scream and now this. Not bad but Kid Cudi himself aka Scott Mescudi all jacked and ready to show the world his other talents is the real surprise her. I really wanted that director to be Matthew McConaughey though and almost thought it was until I saw his face. He literally sounds just like him. Can't wait to see this and add it to my Halloween collection this year.
I'm getting whiplash from this trailer's tone changes
This is literally just present day Whanganui
A24 KEEP IT COMING!
I feel a strong influence of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) in this. With the way it's filmed and the decade it's set in.
Wtf is wrong with people there is no reason to see this film after this trailer
Song?
NGL this just looks like a fun time 😂
SLAY24!!!!
Why does every comment seem scripted?
The Texas Pornstar Massacre
_Ohhh Come On! Don't go in there..._ _...Leatherface lives there!!!_
The movie looks interesting, also this trailer made me attracted to Jenny Ortega 😅
very texas chainsaw vibes
This is a trailer. Sets the movies premise, and shows some great shots but nothing to revealing
Music trailer?
I. CANT. WAIT. 🙌🏼‼️❗️‼️❗️
Anyone help with the name of the track they’re playing can’t remember who did it.
Y’all know kid cudi in this movie
Looks different. Will definitely give this a watch
Oh sweet jesus this looks amazing
I thought this was gonna be some nonfiction flick about a porn actress or movie, but this is was more exciting!
Oh I'm SO fucking watching this!
I'll be keeping a closer eye on Jenna Ortega. She seems very promising.
Tara gets to star in her own "elevated" horror movie.
Really weird. Hopefully as weird as hereditary. Or i ain't watchin.....🙃🤘
What’s the song in the trailer
Love that 70ish look 🔥
Entertaining trailer. Anyone know the song in it?
I haven't seen a new movie I've wanted to see so bad in a really long time! Wow!
Texas Boogie Nights Massacre? Well, hell, sign me up.
After seeing Jenna Ortega’s PHENOMINAL performance in Scream last night, I am looking forward to seeing her in this too. Right now she is a Scream Princess on her way to a Scream Queen
The vibe of this is really cool AND ALSO I'm kinda of tired of these horror movies that demonize people w dementia. They didn't choose it! That said, this looks like there might be something else afoot, so I'm very willing to give such a great looking movie a chance!
Brittany Snow… in a A24 film?!?! Omg 😍
no love for Lou Taylor Pucci in the main credits yet again jesus
After not being able to watch the much awaited Lamb I'm getting a bit disheartened with A34
oooooh I'm very intrigued! Liked the bizarre trailer. It's cut so chaotically. Or it feels like it. But its good!
Y'all put them on too high of a pedestal. Like half their movies are flops. Saw a comment on ZZavids video "hOw aBouT mOre A24 hoRRor." Cringe
I’m intrigued I might have to check this out
Anymore know the song they used in this trailer??
It’s the same vibe as evil dead
такая параша, конечно
A24 FTW!
Jenna Ortega the next big scream queen??👀❣
Note: I saw this trailer as an ad. Ya know.... while watching the start of the trailer i thought this gonna be maybe a bio pic, a typical period piece, or your average tale to fame story. And then i saw the A24 logo and threw all of that out the F-ing window, because this is gonna be F-ed up and disturbing. And saw the rest of the trailer and looks like i was right.
I've said it before & I'll say it again- I'll have whatever A24 is selling.
So Country Porn, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and retro horror had a threesome at A24?. I will give it a try, why not I enjoyed Lamb too.
Y...       Did I not know about this?
Damn Jenna Ortega🥵
great cast
finally a new Ti West film!! He's got the talent that his movies really look like from their era. Acting, scenery, film optics - love it!
Love the actors, love the genre,  count me in on this one!!!!!
A24 makes films for film geeks and I love it
Mmmmmmmmia Gooooothhhhh 🤤
Kid Cudi acting now? Count me in
Mia Goth ❤️👍👍
Man who made that song
I liked it better when it was on a MST3K episode called "The Touch of Satan."
It's giving "the visit"
At first I thought this would be a remake of the 2011 film. But it isn’t. Haha
The "Texas chainsaw massacre" ambientation/setting combined with something completely unknown... i but that for a dollar
😳🍿
This looks soo good!!!
A24 has been making hands down the best movies for the last 15 years or so
Is that Kid Cudi ????
This has perfect Resident Evil 7 Baker vibes. And Mia Goth is always worth a watch.
Definitely looks like another Ti West movie and that's a great thing.
Isn’t tha one actress super young
whats the song?
Finally a new  horror movie that is looking good
Their choice in music for this trailer is waaaaay off…
I don't know how I feel about watching Jenna Ortega in this kind of a movie she is way too young
Looks like a Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake with Leatherface replaced by an old lady! Grindhouse trying to make come back again!!
Song?
OK so this is not a remake of the earlier X movie. Already got me with a 'didn't see it coming'.
It took me way too long to realise that that’s kid cudi
Is it gonna give it to me though?
Looks interesting, and I'm so desperate for a good movie.
Going to be awesome! 70s porn and horror 🤘
This is Oscar Worthy. I love the filming, the 80s slash horror and feel to it. Just amazing.
A24  Keeping true cinema alive one film at a time.  This looks like a Quinton Tarantino horror film
The casting is genius I love these girls 🤘😍
OMG! A24 is something!! I can't find a word to describe it so..
Is this the same house from Texas Chainsaw Massacre or is it just very similar?
So this is The Visit but a porn parody?
Love Ti West
Does anyone know the song? Is it ozzy?
another boring horror film
I love A24
A24 for the win🏆🏆🏆
Mia gothh and kid cudi???? Can’t wait
So basically any other slasher from the 80s
So it’s an old woman.. so what?
What song is this?
At first I thought that was Matthew McConaughey - too bad it isn't, it would have been great 🙂
This is different. This is A24.
Anyone have the name of the song in the trailer? I can't tell what he's saying.
Damn. Kid Cudi in a horror movie? That should be interesting
Anything from A24 always seems worth a watch.
This better be rated X ;)
looks like a texas chainsaw porno hybird
I’ll check this out for ‘Jenny Ortega’ just saw her in ‘Scream’ and she was really good! Plus this looks interesting with the cast in it…
GORGEOUS GORGEOUS GIRLS LOVE OWEN CAMPBELL
This looks dope.
So here’s my theory. The old woman has schizophrenia and is at her absolute worst late at night. Sometimes they operate on a schedule. It’s both fascinating and terrifying.
God bless you
So this isnt the new x men? :l
anyone know the song being used in this?
song??
This looks fucking incredible
Ok I HATED Scream 5 but Jenna Ortega was great and and am so excited to see her in this!
I get it, X Is Chainsaw Massacre
The trailer spoils the whole movie
THE FACT THAT IT HAS THE SAME VIBES AS TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE IS LIT
Jenna Ortega becoming the new Scream Queen I see
My man Ti West loves his zooms.
SCOTT MESCUDI
The whole movie aesthetic's is dope !!!! 😀 It looks like a mix of Boogie Nights & Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Looking forward to seeing 👍
Cool, they put out their new meme on their video with a girl who opened her mouth and saw the horror on her face.
I love A24. Fell in love with the lighthouse and I know every movie will be original after I saw thagnone
Jenna is in literally everything. She will be the next big actress just watch
Does this not look like a prequel to the Texas chainsaw massacre ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Anyone know what song is used in this trailer?
looks bloody awesome
What’s that the name of the song tho?
Song name anyone?
NICE!
Looks awesome
This gives u that Debbie Does Dallas/Deep Throat vibe but with a twist. Looks good.
What’s that song in the background ?
If it’s A24 I have to watch
kid cudiiiiii
I see A24 continues to hold ALL of Hollywood on its back. Must be exhausting.
beware! old people! 👻
jenna ortega is in sm stuff nowadays! that’s great to see her getting so many roles since most disney kids flop after disney
The Texas Chainsaw Boogie.
What’s that song???
Went here for the smut, stayed for the plot
what’s the song in this trailer called?
A24's track record don't stop. I think their movies will be revered among the greats--definitely the best of this generation
Geezus, derivative much? They probably call it a homage to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I call it unoriginal.
At this point A24 can throw any movie, I'm more than willing to watch it EXACTLY because it came from A24.
anything with Mia goth in it I will watch 😗✨
Did they just give away the ending with the cops?
X Gon' Give It to Ya
What
I’m on the X I’m on the codine
KID CUDI???
Jenna Ortega !!!
brittany snow te quiero
They rarely disappoint, they take out at least 1 jewel per year and this seems to be innovative
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I too am terrified when I see a strange senior citizen completely naked, actually, I can't think of anything more terrifying.
Pronto   ª | oficial trailer 😐
Looks like something I would enjoy if it weren't for the x-rated/adult film aspect of it. If they kept the 70s style and a group of people making a movie at a friends house, I would watch it. BUt I'm so tired of all the sx in every single movie. And lately the scenes have been getting more and more graphic. I'm just sick of it.
kid cudi acting now huh
Ti West made 'House Of The Devil' so I'm in.......
X
Boogie Nights in horror lmao this looks good
lit
I saw this trailer it was a red band trailer before scream. I think it was the first time I've seen a red band trailer play in a theatre. Anyone I really thought it was chainsaw massacre when it first started out.
Ti West has yet to disappoint me with his movies, cannot wait.
Foghat!
I cant wait to not see this
Eh, no thanks. 👎🏻
what a load of bs
Ti West is back. Finally.
1:02 Damn Jenna Ortega is so hot!
Mia Goth 🤍
A24 always makes creepy disturbing movies and i love it haha
The plot is similar to One-Eyed Monster, but it's not about murderous penis.
We honestly need more original films like this!
Who ever is making trailers these days need to show less, I feel like I seen pretty much all the movie...😕
🔥
Give it up for Kid Cudi 🎉
Looks interesting and original I’m in
Damn I thought this was the new X Men movie.
the guy with the glasses looks like he is from evil dead 2013 haha
Brittany Snow!! Yuuusssss keep them original movies coming A24 \m/
Scott Mescudi yooooo
Well if it's from Ti West thats all I need to know especially w/ that cast which is pretty Killer in itself ! Is that Lou Taylor Pucci as well in it or do I just need to stop my evil Dead marathons while I'm waiting on films like this and the Evil Dead Rise and Terrifier 2 ? A24 almost always makes AMAZING films no matter the type .
A24 is too raw!!!! Every single movie!!!! Can’t wait for this
Jenna Ortega just keeps comin with the horror movies I see lol
Wow this looks awesome
this will become a cult classic
Love Ti West, but this looks a little too basic for him. I've been waiting for him to make a movie again for years now & he does & it feels nothing like his others. But I guess it's good to keep my hopes low so I'm not disappointed.
Is X Gone Give It To Ya?  Because I like when that happens.
This kind of looks like The Visit but good.
When eyebrows aren't where eyebrows should be, I loose focus and my train of thought becomes eyebrows; who looks at a face and decides, "What this face needs, is less face, and start her forehead at the upper eyelids."
Let's goooo Scotttt
Jenna Ortega is all grown up now...😭
Jesus loves you all very much repent and believe onto Him and be saved from eternal punishment of sin amen, Jesus DIED for you <3 :)
The X men are not as I remember them
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
Excited for new Ti West!
based on R. Kelly's found footage.
This movie doesn't look like a homage to TCM but a straight rip off. The first part of this trailer looks like the original TCM too much. Just swap leatherface for granny.
Bruh I can already tell this movie is gonna be corny af
only watching this for Jenna Ortega
I swear I thought that was Matthew McConaughey
From the studio of Hereditary🤟🤟
😎
2022.01.14.           00:50
For a moment, I thought this was a Texas Chainsaw Massacre sequel.
What song was use in the background?
oh shoot I love the X-Men... Oh no
I love A24, but this looks like an M. Night film lol, not interested, or just a bad trailer?
Song name anyone?
Looks like a Chainsaw ripoff 40 years too late.
Looks brilliant.
that seems like a comedy movie, but the trailer is edited as a horror wacky grandma xxx
Is this a sequel to the Project X movie?
🎵“I just want to make love to you” 🎵
thought this was X men
I'm getting some House of 1000 Corpses vibes from this. I dig it.
There's something about A24. It's that feeling which is indescribable yet one is in awe of it.
Houses in horror movies are always white!
A24 ALWAYS DELIVERYING THE MOVIE OF THE YEAR ♥
مخب
I forgot what I was supposed to write.  Can I still get paid?  The film guy said be positives and I am positive I forgot. :) Anyway, I think it is a master.  Piece.  Of terrific film cinema.  (That's close, anyway.  Just pro-rate or something.  Put it on my card.) :)  THANKS!!
Legit, thought this would be x men. Not disappointed, just not what I was expecting.
This looks fucking stupid, disappointing coming from A24
as much as i dislike Jenna Ortega, for some reason idk, her acting looks decent in this.
So boring. It just looks like a generic version of Texas Chainsaw but with porn.
this trailer look freakin cool!
Lamb was slow but good so igive this a whirl.
yo? kid cudi??
Debbie Does The Last House on the Left.
I'm weird. And I like weird movies. Let's go A24
Looks like a good time. Can't wait for this
A24 is so overrated nowadays its actually so pathetic looking at these comments
Cudi we're rooting for you! Make it out alive.
You had me at A24
Опять поехали самоубиваться ))
I really like Ti West horror movies, but I've got a feeling this will be another one of those that has to have the "Ending of X Explained" sites.
A24? I’m there!
I love Jenna Ortega and Britney Snow
This looks stupid
what’s the song ?
And they got kid cudi in this?!?! Can’t wait
It sounds like Home Depot song😂
So that's how difficult it is to find a good location for independent low-budget productions.
YAS!!! A24
It looks promising (though I have been disappointed before with film hype). Thank you for the video.
A new genre, pron slash
There is something deeply symbolic about a movie named “X” that’s rated R  But I’d be lying if it didn’t catch my attention
A24...?  --Okay I'm there!
Ti west is back!
Song is "I Just Wanna Make Love To You," by Foghat (1972).
1:02 Speed 0.25 your welcome
omg anyone knows the name of the music??
X...
A24 is PURE cinema. Thanks a lot !!!
Another past time horror porn flick ....dear god
Just leave the barn.
Secluded Cultural Ritual= check. Naked old person/people= check. A24 is starting to get some repeats  in it's brand. It still looks like something I'd like to see, especially consideeing the whole "whoever is screwing gets killed" angle applies to everyone here haha.  Of course the scariest part for me was No Eyebrows....
Another great original film that will make me want a sequel I’ll never get 😂
What is the song in the trailer?
This looks kinda creepy lol but how they gonna pull to a dirty ass place and just start filming porn 🤣🤣
I need to know the song name
I have two reasons to watch this movie: A24 and Jenna Ortega! Cant wait!!
So 70s. Looks just like Texas Chainsaw Massacre
WELL THAT WAS FUNNY 🔞🔞🔥
Seems like a magnet picture release not A24
Three tickets for me, my wife and my wife’s son for the newest A24-produced, genre-redefining, trope-subverting, atmospheric, dark and eerie, emotionally draining, gut wrenching, aesthetically heavy craft by post-horror auteur with an arthouse edge, dread-inducing, suspenseful build up with strong character development and gradual feeling of escalation, bone-chilling slow burn with “say more with less” approach and soul-shaking, blood-curdling, skin-crawling and nerve-wracking exercise in persistently looming dread where tension and anxiety permeates every frame as movie reaches its nail-biting, jaw-clenching and paranoia-inducing final climax, free of any cheap gore, cartoonish CGI or infantile jumpscares horror film, please.
I love the fact that A24 keep making new and unique original movies. They may be weird movies but it's the type of weird movies i'd like to see cuz it's different and looks very good and I love weird movies like this Looks badass,
Stop jumping around on things high up. It gives me anxiety!
This looks absolutely fucking stupid.
I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO PUMPED UP FROM A TRAILER!!! Wow this looks amazing. If the movie holds up to these standards it's going to be a wiiiiiiild ride.
Brittany Snow and Mia Goth? I'm sold!
i swear this is gonna be gorey as f---
Looks stupid
Jenna Ortega is the new scream queen
The scary version of Boogie Nights?
I trust the studio, but this trailer is terrible. The film looks interesting I just feel like they're misrepresenting it. At least I hope so. Ey, it's Cudi.
すごい！ 臭いのする映画！
so the sequel is xx and the last one is xxx?
Kinda thought this might be an X-23 movie
Kinda thought this might be an X-23 movie
xqcL
pornographers brutally murdered? sign me up
PLEASE MAKE THIS AVALIABLE IN FRENCH THEATRES and what is the name of the trailer’s music ?
Jenna Ortega has grown up so much
Here I was thinking this was a X-Men movie
Such a snoozefest of a trailer.
CUDiii
I'f i seen that old lady in my room I'd knock her dentures out, call 911 and say she fell xD
They never fucking miss.
Whats the name of the song?
A24 shelling out the duckets for likes and comments hahaha
just truly damn awesome . just truly damn fantastic . just truly damn sensational . just truly damn excellent . WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
idk much but when they say they did hereditary, i know this movie is going to slap as well
wtf cudi
holy shit i can't wait
They rarely disappoint, they take out at least 1 jewel per year and this seems to be innovative
I love Ti West. I was excited for this until I realized that they expect us to believe that super thin super old super frail looking woman is the antagonist. Kinda disappointed. Ill still give a watch when it comes out but im not expecting much.
This looks crazy💯💯💯
This is what i call a fucking horror
A24 is so weird, but thats why we like them, don't we?
This movie is gonna sooo end up like Hereditary. Not many liked it but alot of people loved it. And im gonna love it.
Song?
Oh come on the very beginning of this is sketchy as hell what idiot would actually stay in that house with that creepy ass old dude, pass🙄
the movies that drew me to A24 were good time and uncut gem by the safdie brothers.
Kind of reminds me of a Texas Chainsaw spin-off.
Dang, Jenna Ortega is eveywhere now. The past of couple of days I’ve gotten three different movie trailers with her in them. Good for her
Wack
DAMN. A24 never disappppoints!
Stupid ah movie
Dis shit is hilarious
So, you think you are scary?
Is that Kid Cudi?
This is where the fish lives.
ich hab bock ;)
Is Jenna Ortega the new Scream Queen of this era or generation? Because I don’t mind it. You, Scream, and now this.
oh god i am starting to love mia goth, she has a range and she chooses very particular projects
Kid Cudi aint a kid no more! MOON MAN
A24 is my place to go for horror/suspense movies, keep it up.
Interesting. I get The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Evil Dead Vibes.
xcur stock to the moon very soon keep eye on it 🔥
I could not have been the only one thinking 'Euriel' and 'Eustace' from courage the cowardly dog
I don't think they should tag on Hereditary like that, Ari Aster is the master behind that and Midsommar. So don't expect this to be like those films. However, this does look interesting enough, but i have doubts about this one. I'll give it a chance.
Meh
I need to be famous Wayne!
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life12
Diversity cast: CHECK
Jenna Ortega is the greatest
Boogie nights meets cabin in the woods?! Scott Mescudi?! Yes please
Bruh been wantin to make or c a movie like dis fo yrs genius respect its entertainment trailer gangsta no cap lol stay safe RIP Bob Saget Betty White Sidney Poitier Ronnie Spector BLM God bless stop all dis hate checkout The Main Squeeze 🙏
i’d watch any movie they make at this point.
What's this with A24 movie releases only in month of spring. This Sinister Spring already my bucket list for 2022.
Looks good
Take my money now, TiGuy.
Meh
Reminds me of Taking of Deborah Logan and The Visit. I'll definitely be checking this out
Lets keep making movies about how dangerous rural people are when you are 99% more likely to be murdered in the cities
The boy Cudi looking like Bill Cosby 😂😂😂
Can't wait for this, love Ti West's films so much, particularly his film THE SACRAMENT.
FINALLY. Mia Goth get the spotlight! I love her act, is so peculiar yet beautifully captivating
THIS IS SUPER STAR STUDDED CAST! It's LIKE 3 SCREAM QUEENS! Jenna Ortega, Mia Goth & Brittany Snow!
I love seeing hereditary in anything
A24 is not a studio... it's a genre
Oh god here we go again
Lmao what
Wtf. Oh my gosh....
I'm going to love this. Wow!
KiD CuDi!!!!!!!
Our friends live in that house. Going to make visiting a little awkward...
YAWN. So the writer saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Visit and decided to combine them both?
A24 is saving Hollywood and that’s a FACT
Everything about this movie looks good except for the horror elements
aehoooooooooo +1 pra lista de filme de terror bom!!!
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus
They had me at Britney Snow
Yea old women are scary lol
finally the return of nudity in Xrated/horror films movies that is not porn
Looks like texas chainsaw massacre but shittier Not sure what all the comments hyping this absolutely mediocre trailer are about..
Finally! A horror film referencing the 1970's XXX "roughies" that played 42nd Street grindhouses regularly but didn't get mainstream notice! Even as a parody this should be interesting in the very least!
I'm so ready for this
A24 never dissapoints
So... Porn is trying to take over mainstream. This is why so many movies nowadays SUCK!
Neat
INCOMING CUDI S*X SCENES.
Yeah I’m in
This looks hilariously fucked up. Count me in.
I love the fact that A24 keep making new and unique original movies. They may be weird movies but it's the type of weird movies i’d like to see cuz it's different and looks very good and I love weird movies like this
this movie almost looks fun...    are we sure this is A24?!
So this is like a dark porno lol 😂.
The Rapture is coming. What they tell you after is a lie. They’ll say we were abducted by aliens. Btw, those are not aliens, they’re demons. Read Revelation DONT TAKE THE MARK OF THE BEAST. ❤️
This has the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre all over it
Looks great
Just from the trailer alone you can see that Jenna Ortega is giving a good performance.
kid cudi been popping up in everything
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
Old lady 👵 are not scary. Only when you put some screaming 😱 and music behind.
JENNAAAA
A24 have realy lowered their standards huh this looks like garbage
jeepers creepers
1:09 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cudiiiiii
Kid Cudi and a horror movie?! Banger Incoming
Cudi cudi cudi cudi cudi cudi (: <3
Song is " I just want to make love to you " by FOGHAT..........................My pleasure !!
Did we watch the same trailer? Because this looks horrible
I love the fact that A24 keep making new and unique original movies. They may be weird movies but it's the type of weird movies i'd like to see cuz it's different and looks very good and I love weird movies like this
I'll watch it, but it gives me Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) vibes.
Him looking through the hole makes me think of scary movie
Everyone buy ethereum and hold it a few months from now you'll be a few hundred maybe thousand richer let's get this cake
If Tarantino would made a horor film, this would be his Masterpiece! ***
LETS GOOOOO NEW TI WEST!!!
The way this was filmed.
I didn't know Mia Goth was in the film until the trailer ended. She really became unrecognizable.
Another wholesome family picture from A24!
A24?! I'm in!
BRITTANY SNOW YESS
looks awful
I'm getting boogie nights vibes mixed with Texas Chainsaw and the old people reminded me of the grandparents from the visit. I'm honestly excited to see how this movie is.
cudii
Is there any connection to the other movie 'X'? The movie posters are almost identical, maybe just a coincidence though
new a24 horror film? COUNT ME TF IN
A24 always has bangers
Man this is some texas chainsaw kinda shit right here
omggggg
What is the song that plays throughout? Xxx
Love the 70's horror period piece. Right down to the 70's cinematography. This has a cross between Boogie Nights and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, count me tf in! 🤘🏼🤘🏼
Scott Mescudi playing a 70s porn star in an A24 horror movie! hell yeah
Not gonna lie, this looks kinda silly. I was hoping A24 would give us some more movies (not like, but as good as) Hereditary, The Lighthouse, Lady Bird, & Moonlight. This one looks a little too much like everything we've seen before :\
Now that is a well made movie trailer
Kid Cudi, I see you
Now this is a A24 film that im interested in. TCM with a mix of porn. I just hope its not another "white people in cults film"
I adore Mia Goth
This looks bad ass 💚💪👊💥💅
come on A24 bringing back the 80s thrillers 😌💅🏽
Great and we need and wish videos in Real Best  4K  60fps  HDR  resolution clarity quality soon please and Sound in full HD 3D Stereo Surround
Right on!
Might this be their first bad film?
Pitch perfect
I wonder if theres gonna be any boobs in it?
A24
oh god i am starting to love mia goth, she has a range and she chooses very particular projects
*Take my money.* *You had me at Ti West and A24.*
Jenna Ortega cementing her place as a scream queen YASS good for her
Pls it makes me sad that the guy from super dark times didn’t get any billing…. It would help cuz I don’t know his name but I know his face 😭😭
Love me some Ti West.
Yes yes and yes!
I am totally here for Jenna Ortega becoming a scream queen 🙌🏾
Anyone know the name of the song
Scott Mescudi bout to be 🔥🔥
Boogie nights but scary?
this movie looks like it is going to be wild asf and very much scary at the same time almost like midsommar. i am so ready for this!! a24 is definitely my favorite entertainment company. all their movies are so good!!
A24 & Kid Cudi brought me here. HYPED
Cant find it on imdb
Whats the movie about?
A24👌🏽
jenna oretaga the upcoming scream queen
I have a question. Why you always make a goddamn perfect something like this. I mean this is will be fantastic!
Looks like a big homage to 70's - early 80's horror movies that were "rated X" by the MPAA like Tobe Hooper's original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Eaten Alive, and Motel Hell.
Rated X.
this looks good
Trailer is great except for the gd song choice. Doesn't fit at all imo
This reminds me of a Grind House trailer
Didn't M. Night do this sort of thing already? :\
It’s giving me rob zombie vibes
His movies are not that brilliant...just mediocre but let's see how this one goes. It's a24 studio.. So high hopes.
Jenna Ortega is the new Scream Queen
mia goth <3
Looks interesting and different, will watch!🔥💯💯
never thought i'd see jenna ortega in a movie about fucking. or kid cudi
A24, Mia Goth and a score by Chelsea Wolfe .. Yes please. I cannot wait!!!
Anyone know what the music in the trailer is?! 🎸🤘
THERE’S THE A24 WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE!
Can someone tell me the song in the back
the soundtrack to this trailer is absolutely brilliant 🤩
The fact that this movie was filmed in my hometown is wack …
I love A24 but this looks pretty luck luster
Me: A24, can we get Matthew McConaughey?  A24: No, we have Matthew McConaughey at home. Matthew McConaughey at home:
Mia Goth in an A24 film? This is gonna be good
I’m here for ittttt!
Good, downhome people kill degenerate pornographers. Good film
this movie looks good af brittney snow in it and kid cudi omggg
damn
It looks good. Amazing even
This Looks F *** Good
Has a sort of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" vibe, the 1974 version that is. Also like how the movie within the movie seems to be merging with the movie's plot. This has me intrigued.
Texas Chainsaw vibes
Song ??
Best trailer I've seen in a while
I wasn't convinced in the beginning, but this looks wild.
Hell yeah.
Three genres are guarantees for a film/series to be successful: wrestling, porn, and horror.
This seems dope
Jenna is gonna have a really good year
Not another remake, reboot, or soft reboot? Count me in.
How is that *NOT* a de-aged Matthew McConaughey with prosthetic nose?!
KID CUUUDI🚀✨🎸
Looks killer! That the same naked granny from It Chapter II?
Brittany Snow a part of cast? I’m in!
A porn movie of terror, yes man
What is the music/song?
A24 can do no wrong.
I love most of the films A24 has produced in the last few years, but this looks like a steaming turd pile.
Ti West is one of the best directors of Horror!!! Looking forward to this! He was the responsible of The House of the Devil (2009).
Jenna Ortega is really having the best year of her career. Scream 5, The Fallout and now X? Wow.
Ti West made one of my movies ever, The House of The Devil so this incredibly exciting. Hell yeah!
Jenna Ortega, Scream Queen
Same director of midsommar lest we forget. This movie is gonna flip me out 😄💀
Thank you A24 for being the only studio with enough courage to put out original stories!
Mia Goth supremacy
Cudder
Thanks A24 for being brave enough to give us REAL movies!
Anyone clock the name of the song that plays over the second half of the trailer?
This looks absolutely amazing.
Ti West is one of the best and most underrated directors working in the US right now. Loved the Innkeepers too. Anyway, looking forward to this.
The trailer was that weird, eerie, creepy kind of trailer. I’m interested in the movie
"I say one goddamn fucked up horror picture"   :)
2022 is jenna's year omg
Somewhere in this film, I imagine a big twist is someone is going to “accidentally” screw this old lady, then que a subtle ad for Vagisil or something of the ilk.
Trashy, fun, mashup of genres!!!  I love it!!
So excited for this!
Jennie Ortega is def one of the young stars to watch
Oh hell yes!
So this is the XXX version of the movie, "The Visit'?
Guys the song is called “i just want to make love to you” by FOGHAT!!
Does anyone what the song they are using is called?
Oh hell yeah!!! God I love A24!!!
Was so stoked when I spotted Scott Mescudi in the Van!
I feel like the trailer was a little too long and showed a little too much, but it looks amazing
Took me forever to realize that was Kid Cudi in this LMAO
I saw this in an early screening and it’s sincerely the best horror movie I’ve ever seen. Go see it opening weekend!
While I dont like sexual content and will be skipping this, I'll admit it looks interesting
When I first saw the thumbnail I swear I thought it was another X-men movie lmao🤣😂
Cannot wait to see this !!! A24 =🔥
Someone help what is the song so I can play it until I hate it
ugh this song is catchy
At first I was like, “don’t tell me this is a Linda Lovelace porno biopic or something…” The A24 magic happened right when the trailer took a horror turn.
Can Jenna Ortega please live in this one.
of course they had to make it at least a little woke lol
"Texas Chainsaw" meets "Boogie Nights!"
Looks like shit !
A new A24 horror? It's not even my birthday. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Seems dumb, not at all scary.
Okay that hooked me from the jump.
For those wondering, the song is called “I Just Wanna Make Love To You” by Foghat
I need this movie in my eye balls. Ti West and Cudi 👍🏻👍🏻
Lit money cash
“Boogie Nights” meets “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre”.
How come the real names of the actors in this movie actually sound like porn names.  I mean Brittany Snow, Mia Goth.  Come on. that's pretty cool.
Looks good even if it didn't have Ti West, Kid Cudi, and Brittany Snow involved, but those three make me more interested.
Trailer song is "I Just Want To Make Love To You ( LP Version ) by Foghat" but seems to be a remixed version, which sounds class.
Is it me or do some parts of the music score sound like the Home Depot or O’Reilly’s song?   (If not those two than one of the other hardware stores out there)
Tobe Hooper wants his movie back.
A24 you can honestly take my subscription for life. You just keep delivering, and I suck it all up to the last drop.
YYYYYAEEEEASSSSSS
Innovative background score!
Looks trash!
Well…that just looks like a whole heap of fun!
There's another channel hosting this trailer where literally 90% of the comments is: "I thought this was X-Men related 😢."  Anyway, this looks great.
Jenna in a A24 film?!? Omg she’s thriving 😩😩
Sees kid cudi “take my money”
I didn’t even realize that was cudi this movies bouta be fire
Damn, Kid Cudi is really going for that acting career, apparently
What did I just watch..
woooah
I'm not a Ti West convert; I thought House of the Dead  was an impressive pastiche but not much more and The Innkeepers was woefully paced with sluggish scares but I'm always ready for someone to get better. He certainly has the technical chops.
I'm curious to see what the ultimate threat is because it just seems like old people are just flesh eating monsters. I hope ther6e more to the story and the characters. So far it just looks like a TCM rip off. We'll see.
Brought to you by home Depot.
There's something about A24. It's that feeling which is indescribable yet one is in awe of it.
Jenna joining Brittany as a Scream Queen, love that
jenna ortega is my new favorite scream queen
This looks fucking great. A24 definitely pushes the envelope with their films. Looks fun and genuinely terrifying. One of my most anticipated films now.
Holy smokes, this looks amazing
I thought Ti West got metoo’d
Anyone else find it kind of distracting that they use the Home Depot jingle?
Oh shit
A24 strikes again! By far the most unique and original studio out for the past few years!
Texas Chainsaw Massacre kinda-ish?
It's giving me shades of TCM! I have a feeling Ti West is gonna feel right at home with A24.
I'm a simple man. I see a new A24 trailer, I get hyped.
Looks awesome.  Can't wait!
Hot DAYUM!
Who the heck keeps coming up with these films and why does A24 keep making them 😭
These people look like they went to The Larry Stortch School of Acting....😜
What song is that playing in the Background of the trailer!?
We love you A24. You sure know how to pick 'em.
"this is very original/innovative" have you ever seen a slasher film in your life?
mmmmmmm violence and SEX we need way more of this in life, there's just not enough.
HEREDITARY is my #1 film from them
song?
A Jack Horner Production
Texas chainsaw massacre !!!
Sold
Looks Interesting.
-I See A24 👁  -I Click.
yea im interested to see this
Sweet childhood is waiting eagerly for new Disney movies.  Growing up is waiting eagerly for new A24 movies.
"You can't just change halfway through a movie"  Oh, the irony's palpable.
Only seen In a Valley of Violence, which was pretty decent.
Mia Goth + A24 = Movie Magic Thought the title would refer to ecstasy (drug horror?) but I guess they meant X-rated like a teXas chainsaw throughback.
Give the whole movie away Jesus Christ  So they all die.
Jenna Ortega is soooo great. Her screams are on point. Can't wait to see her in the new Scream movie 😱👀
a vintage farm/horror porno? I'm in.
Oh my god
Yes fuckin please
Can't wait! So glad Kid Cudi is doing well with recovering from his addiction & trying to get on with his life. Wish him much success!!❤
Aye hell yeah A24 and kid cudi I’m about to take my movie friends and my friends that’s listen to cudi we about to have a blast watching this
Grandma is off her meds again
This looks crazy.
Feels very Texas Chainsaw and Friday the 13 esque
That woman screamed soooo good they made her the thumbnail.
House of the Devil is my favorite modern-made horror film. Excited for this.
What a strange looking X-Men movie
Boogy Nights X Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Sign me up!
Ti West is one of my favorite indie horror directors. Can’t stress enough how much I love House of the Devil, The Innkeepers and The Sacrament. In a Valley of Violence was a departure, but still solid on its own. I’ve been waiting a long time for his next feature and X looks fantastic! I think this will be a very “fun” horror film. Meaning it’s not going to take itself so seriously, but still bring the violence and nastiness you would expect from something like this. Can’t wait to see this.
Can’t wait for this !
Whats the song?
Looks dope what's the name of the song
New ti west movie? im in
This looks disgusting but clever
A story told with good acting and original plot! This is all wrong!! Someone bring me a reboot..
Well… it’s definitely different
Damn this looks good!
Kid Cudi out here looking like Richard Pryor.
Ti West X A24 aight I’m in The Sacrament was so dope
meh.
So everyone died and the police find the video recorder at the end and that’s the line they say? I hope not
The old lady wandering around reminds of the old lady from the Mystery Science Theater episode Touch of Satan.  "Uhh... Did a plucked turkey in a wig just talk to me?"
Phenomenal soundtrack choice
This looks amazing. What's the song?
Even A24’s _trailer_ subverts your expectations. (And excited to see Brittany Snow in another role that utilizes her talents.)
Holy shit!! This looks incredible. And omg I love that Brittany Snow has been cast against type.  I’m getting TCM meets Boogie Nights vibes!
So basically granny is horny. Is that it?
Oh god a A24 film !!!! YESSSSSSSSSSS
This movie is gonna be really hard for people to google.
I'm in.
So Texas chainsaw massacre but with pornstars ….. alright I dig
I love Mia Goth, she doesn't like Hollywood type of movies.
TI West is finally getting the exposure he deserves. I’ll be seeing this one day one!
Wtf u guys making ?? This is fucking awesome 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Jenna is in it so I’m down
This movie looks so good
old people are scary
i need this like right now
A24 are the 👑 of 🎥 trailers not giving spoilers away
omg owen campbelllll
Gives off that pervasive 'Yikes!' feeling (like a "Texas Chainsaw")... I'll give it a go. 😎
🙌🏻
this looks so intense
Is that kid cudi
What happened to her eyebrows?
Anyone know the song?
Anything with Jenna Ortega is already a big plus. The trailer looks sick too. Definitely checking this out
WAIT ITS KID CUDI????
Like the music...FOGHAT!!!
A horror movie about shooting a porno in a haunted house. Sounds cool.
Keep pushing the Ken Car$on agenda
looks interesting
Scoooooooty!!!💕
The Banging of Deborah Logan.
Great trailer btw
His name is Ed Gein started all of this horror way back in 1956. true story.
Brittany a horror queen and the new supreme jenna? And tiwest? I cannot wait, the movie looks very promising looking forward to it!!
If u told me this was a 70s movie trailer just remade in HD i would believe it.
Jenna looks so hot in the naughty scene! I hope it’s way longer in the movie!
We honestly need more original films like this!
really felt like a old horror movie trailer
Where do we watch these movies at
Damn! I can't wait
Midsommar slasher porn
kudiiiiiiiiiii
Kid Kudi is transitioning well
TI WEST YESSSSS
SCOTT!!!
Texas Chainsaw and the taking of Deborah Logan vibes.
Im just watching it because of the studio behind and the director
Cant believe kid cud took the role of the black man who dies first in horror movies!!
HEREDITARY SLAPS
Song name " I just to make love to you " Foghat
TAKE MY MONEY NOW!!!
major Texas Chainsaw vibes
Looks interesting
Looks good!
Jenna coming for that Scream Queen title
Finally new Ti West movie! Very excited
omgggg
Looks interesting.
Looks like a nice throwback horror flick. Good tune too. Three chainsaws up!
A24 just wont stop. Keep it flowing!
I see Jenna Ortega, I get excited. She's SOOOO good
Looks dumb
looks decent
Ortega & Cudi ‼️ I’m absolutely seeing this day 1 lol
MY GAWD Kid Cudi is hot
X gonna give it to you
This trailer came just early, and I'm already hyped and excited
Why am I seeing Jenna Ortega in so many movies now? Scream, The Fallout & now this one
Does anyone know the name of the song/remix used in this trailer? Thanks in advance :)
Soooo cool 🔥🔥🔥
An original film. Glad it’s not a prequel, sequel, reboot. That’s all we get nowadays
When?
PLZ DONT LET KID CUDI DIE
*Brittany Snow*
I love Jenna Ortega, I'm so, so proud of her doing more mature roles for movie while balancing them with "down-to-earth" type role.
This movie seems like style over substance kinda movie. I might be wrong tho
The visit does Dallas I guess?!
This looks way more horror comedy than horror but fingers crossed and upside down pentagram lit it’s good!
Nice, so everyone dies in the end.
This trailer made me smile. Ti West is back!
Matthew McConaughey and John Lennon in ONE movie?!!! Damn A24 steppin' up their game
MIA GOTH Okay imngonna watch this
Looks really interesting and unique
Damn, Ti West is back!
Finally Ti West release another level horror film..
This trailer gives me goosebumps and Scott Mescudi is making them worse
Let me sink in Lamb first. 😂✨
Another A24 film that people will be wanking about for ages much like hereditary 😴
0:29 for a second I though it is a Greene Family Farm from Walking Dead.
yes
I'm not being fooled again by this crap A24 is pretentious idiotic and dumb .
A lot of Texas Chain-Saw Massacre references here.
We need a break from Blumhouse
An original movie that is not a prequel, sequel, franchise, reboot or do-over. How very excellent. 👌
The Texas Chainsaw massacre vibes are too strong with this one, and I ain't even comparing cz it looks damn good
deffo watching this
I have been waiting for a good or even a great horror picture from Ti West. He is one unique director. Although I have only seen few of his work.
YES ! Finally some more "true" horror. So sick of all the reboot and sequel bullshit money grabs like scream, and conjuring crap.
here hazbin hotel will rise 😈❤️😈
Kind Regards, as desperately as I may sound, I am a desperate aspirant who was accepted to study Medicine in russia 🇷🇺, but requires financial assistance, Any help of any sort will be highly appreciated
New Ti West joint? Today is a good day
Count me in! Absolutely loved The House of the Devil, and this looks like a major TCM homage but with hopefully a twist. Need to see his other work.
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but artsy
Looks good
Jenna Ortega is coming for Jamie Lee's crown. She is AMAZING in Scream.
Love the trailer
This looks promising but I‘m more excited about the fact that it’s an A24 Movie then about Ti West directing. Haven‘t seen all of his work but his short in VHS was just okay and House of the Devil was a bore fest despite it’s lovely retro style. Still hooked about that one.
loving all the texas chainsaw massacre motifs…sign me UP
Kid Cudi and A24! 🥳 I’m sold no trailer needed!
Looks badass, man been a while since I've been this excited for a horror release!
They really nailed making it look an old film
Yes yes yes, take my money A24
Mia Goth looks bloody amazing
Absolutely did not recognize Kid Cudi.
THIS GONNA BE MY JOKER
Bro if Apple buys out A24…..I’m Sick
its Zack and Miri Make a Porno meets Texas chainsaw massacre lol
Everybody say "Thank you A24" 😊
They rarely disappoint, they take out at least 1 jewel per year and this seems to be innovative
The real king of modern horror is back.  Holy shit.  This makes me so happy.
scott mescudi looks exactly like jimi hendrix and lionel ritchie in this, it's crazy
Resonates more like a Blumhouse production.
Just finished watching "Red rocket" hahahaha what a bombbbb 😂 A24 thank you for your awesome films ❤
If its A24 hell yeah im watchin it!
it all falls down to "they should have left in the first place" as usual
Anyone know the song in the background?
i just know this is gonna be fucked up 😂😂
1. А24 2. Хоррор 3. Миа Гот Мне даже трейлер  не нужно смотреть, что бы понять что для меня уже просто сухо эти три пункта "продают" фильм. Ну , не то что бы продают, скорее у меня есть повышенный интерес.  Но глянув трейлер понял что он не "продающий" какой-то, для меня. В любом случае надо будет посмотреть ибо хоррор =* Ну и хоррор от А24 =** Ну и конечно же Миа Гот (да ещё и в хорроре от А24) =*** Миа милючка .  Mia Goth =*
I think A24 is a good fit for Ti West. I think part of A24's success might even be traced back to Ti West's THE HOUSE OF THE DEVIL. The reliance on suspense, the slowburn, the harking back to traditional horror mixed with fresh nuances... It's very much Ti West's trademark in horror and people/studios followed suit -- and A24 is very successful with that "slow and weird" trademark.  Can't wait to see X as I think Ti West is such a strong but unfortunately underrated director. And I'm happy to see Mia Goth in this as well.
I mean I felt like I just saw the entire movie through this trailer but I guess ill watch it just because kudi is in a horror movie🤷🏽‍♂️
Midsommar and Hereditary in the late 70's?  I'm in.
The best trailer I've seen for years. I'm fucking hyped!
nooo not the little sister from You!
Can't wait👍🏻😍🔥
All hail Jenna Ortega! Cinema’s new Scream Queen!
holy fucking cudi
This looks absolutely phenomenal. Jenna Ortega is a real star.
Hmm. This is the first trailer for an A24 picture that didn’t impress me at all.
what a perfect trailer
When you can't afford Matthew McConaughey...
classic horror trailer, shows kill scenes and the ending. twist is the movie is the movie
seeing jenna ortega transition into more mature roles makes me feel like a proud parent
TRASH
Actual good horror?
This looks like a better Texas Chainsaw movie than the actual one we’re getting this year
please tell me there are MST3K fans here thinking this looks just like The Touch of Satan
So I searched “Sonic 06 review” this showed up in the results
During the first few seconds, I legit thought it was a remake of the original TX Chainsaw Massacre. I'm glad it isn't!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
hell yes
What's the song name? Sounds insane
cool
Everybody, this director is a master. The House of the Devil and The Innkeepers are two of the greatest horror movies ever made, The Sacrament was a pretty good found footage flick, Cabin Fever 2 is a hilarious gross-out high school horror, and In a Valley of Violence is a big departure from his work being a western set in the south that feels very mature and extraordinary. Ti West is a name everyone should know. He’s aces!
can't wait!
Funny, how the people are only snobs, who eat whatever a brand says and they still think, that they think by themselves.
Looks good.
Kid Cudi!
Ti  FUCKING West. Thank you.  🤘🏻🤘🏻
Yaaaaas cudi 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Hell yeah new Ti West
A remake already? The original X only came out in 2011?
Where’s Wolverine?
I absolutely hated Hereditary, but this trailer has a Once Upon A Time In Hollywood feel but with horror, so I'm interested. Please be good!
Ti West never disappointed me! and A24?! Shit! Take all my money !!!!
Jenna Ortegaaaa
Brittany Snow looking good in this.
Is like a mix between Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Boggie Nights...
Brittany Snow + A24? Count me in. Love both of them.
Jenna's character saying "I want to be in the movie" is perfect spot on meta.  Looks like she's actually in this one, though nowhere near second place like the cast list pretends.
We're about to see a crazy 3rd act!
Bruh the entire time I was like "Damn that looks a lot like Kid Cudi but no way its him right?"
*Hmm....*
ready to see jenna ortega dying in another movie 🕴
This looks amazing!!!
Is that Brittany snow?
the cast is amazing
I'M SO EXCITED TO SEE THIS
"From the Studio that made Hereditary" That just gave me goosebumps and tears to eyes.. Idk why but that's just powerful because Hereditary was simply a masterpiece
Ti West is one of the most underrated directors in horror, SO PSYCHED FOR THIS ! !
I love A24 and their reliably weird movies
We all know how insane Kid Cudi was in We are who we are as a military soldier now its a 70s black dude who makes porno?? Mans gotta kill it
Texas chainsaw massacre gang, where u at 🔥🤩
love the texas chainsaw massacre vibe
Welp, I probably shouldn't have watched this.  Based on the ending of this trailer.  Looks like everyone dies by the end.
i dig this it’s like if boogie nights ran head first into texas chainsaw massacre and the visit while stopping by grindhouse on the way
Kid cudi ain't aging
Ayyy! Cudi😃😃 I'll be watching!
dayyyýuuumnn this looks hella satisfying
Good to see cudi in more films 👏🏽
Como diria a flora: Que velha safadaa
My guess is that the old lady is secretly some kind of succubus, and the fact that the crew is shooting an adult film awakens her bloodlust.
Kid cudi🔥🔥🔥
These Texas Chainsaw Blu-ray extras look awesome
That scream 😱 😱 😱
NICE!!!
brittany snow, yes please
"X" movie but rated "R"...
oh yeah
Another A24 movie, with Kid Cudi. LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOO
A24 is a revolution.
I love Ti West! Bring it on!!!
Aaaaah sooo lit! Finally!
Yessir 🔥🔥
CUDIIIIII
Mr.Rager
They should ve shown less in the trailer
what is going ON??? 😟
This is so bizarre and compelling! I’m looking forward to this
NEW A24 HORROR FILM IM IN 🍿
They really had the nerve to use the Home Depot theme song
Love the TCM inspired  cinematography.
Kid Cudi looks like Black Dynamite
Look at Cudi mann
Scotty 🤩
Can't wait fo that shi. Musssst be nice.
I love the nod to Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
This may be one of the most beautiful trailers for a horror film.
only saw the main girl in horror movies shes a good actress
seen scott, i’m sold ❤️
Didn't realize Kid Cudi acted.
Guys your thoughts on this ? I’m kinda split up
Holy...... Gotta love this studio
Oh yeah… this is it!
Ifly
Thought that was Matthew Mconaughey lol
Probably could’ve shelved this one
Kid Cudi and A24 how can we not be hyped for this
A new Ti West horror movie? Hell yeah!
Mia Goth and Kid Cudi???? Yes please.
Looks similar to last year's Censor
It’s funny how they have western accents and it’s filmed in New Zealand 😂
I love the fact that A24 keep making new and unique original movies. They may be weird movies but it's the type of weird movies i'd like to see cuz it's different and looks very good and I love weird movies like this  Edit : Whoops looks like i started some war in the replys. Yeah i still win guys, look how many likes i got, the people who agree with me. Let people like things, let people hate things, It doesn't really matter. If you guys seriously have nothing to do instead of hating a movie without even see the full movie yet, shut tf up. Can't judge a full movie based on a trailer in the case of A24 like don't judge a book by it's cover. Hereditary looks like a generic horror movie in the trailers but look at how it turned out when it was release. What a bunch of coward the replies are!! Hilarious that i got 3k likes who agree with me while you cowards' complain just got 0 likes i guess. Wow some of you must've had a boring life 😂😂😂
💥💥💥💥💥
Pure CUDI 🤯
Ayy, Cudi is in the movie. That's a Day1.
A24 horror movies are so cool.
He's the director of The House Of The Devil,The Innkeepers and V/H/S.
This looks interesting, I can't wait for the sequels to be titled "Y" and then "Z" aswell as the prequels "A", "B", "C" all the way until "W" 😂😂😂
Say less I’m in.
what
1 minute ✊🏼😌
Let's go!
I’m in that looks interesting
Okay
Song?
I love you A24
A24 can't miss.
Yep
A24 trailer? Yes pls
Was just rewatching The Departed as this landed, looks pretty good!  Let's hope it's another Ti West classic, really looking forward to this and Robert Eggers' next.
