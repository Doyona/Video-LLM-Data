You can take the man out of Tottenham but can’t take Tottenham out the man
1-1 between arsenal and Tottenham
Who’s harder to understand Jamie or Harry
So ein sympathischer Mann und es ist eine Freude, ihn bei uns in der Bundesliga spielen zu sehen.
❤❤❤😂
Henry said he can do it all  That's why Harry is a unique CF a phonemonal for this place
imagine kane play at Arsenal for sure will score 50+ goals
he's happy in Munich, finally he can win stuff and be confident
WELL WELL--HE CAN TALK AS WELL AS HE CAN PLAY,     EXCELLENT.
00:15
Class act Kane
Harry Kane the HURRICANE.
No many knows that Harry Kane player for Arsenal FC
Y'knowwww.
JC is right, Thierry and Kane are players!
Harry clear of Henry
A happy Harry is a dangerous Harry
Wiel Gluck in Munschn 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Harry Kane is 30…. damn im getting old 😅
Miss you Harold
Loooong one :)
Harry Kane is an hurricane playing
a player without tattoos
🔴⚪️ Henry 🔴⚪️ Legend 🔴⚪️
If England doesn’t win now with this players I don’t know when it’ll  come next
henry is not only an incredible football player he appears to be very intelligent and well spoken too
Hey Kate 👋
lmmigra don't like me ❤❤❤funking all
Looks good in red and white 😂😂😂
Yeah  he  deserved  good club
3:42 is the clip your looking for
"Yeah, no..."
Can’t believe he scored more goals then Halland so far
"Of course tottenham, WE started the season well"  Harry Kane. Theres always a seat at the table for you.
#MiaSanMia🔴⚪️🔴⚪️🔴⚪️
Klasse Spieler......toller Mensch!!!! Ich mag ihn!!!!
!
Went to a smaller league. In the biggest games he goes missing.
Theres no way somebody Gonna pick Kane over Henry. The only Striker over Henry is Ronaldo the Phenom, and maybe Weah.
2:32 in Harry’s Defense: this „German“ was so bad even I as a german needed to replay a couple of times to know what Jamie wanted to say…
Still needs english speech sessions 🙄 😂
Really embarrassing from this show.  Comparing players with others right on their faces.
germany is doing him good
2:34 "Wiehl Gluk in Muntschen" ?? WTF was he trying to say? I am German, and I didn't understand that guy either.
He sounds happy and relaxed - more so than when interviewed after Spurs games where he was probably trying to be diplomatic about shortcomings
Ermmm… ermmmm…..
still cr7 is the best nr 7 9 10 that premier has ever seen ;)
The phrase Carragher said, was just not German at all and didn't sound like that either. "Funny".
henry is not even funny.
Has Kane or Xavi Simons more impact as a new signing in the Bundesliga?
Adam blake move to Germany
6:33 You can hear him fart!!
Close enough
Wow...Now I can understand better what Kane's saying
Jamie Carragher tried to say in German viel Glück in Munchen which means good luck in Munchen but his pronunciation was really bad!!!
TIIIMMYYY TIIIMMYY TIIIMMYYYYY
Like i said, Kane is an ideal player for bayern with the movement from the wingers and younger players around him.
I'm glad that Bayern got him. Perfect combo <3 I hope that this year Bayern, Barcelona, Arsenal or Napoli wins the trophy.
hehehe.  It was draw.
I love Kane… good player
Best guys
💯💯
Kenapa player England tk ramai berminat di club luar kbnyakn bermain. Di liga dorng sendiri
Kane has had a warm welcome from all german footbal fans. Everybody likes him, what a cool guy, not a dickhead, a superstar. A sensation for the Bundesliga. I hope he wins everything with Bayern Munich.
Thiery Henry is so boring and shallow, I don't understand why the media insist in inviting him on the plateau
Carra has never seen a 9 with the playmaking abilities of a 10 before? Ever heard of a guy named Ibrahimovic?
Thierry of course, nothing to sorry  Thierry won 2 PL, Fa cups played in CL Final in 2006 and in 2000 EL Final so, Thierry Henry is better Didier Drogba is the best in PL of all time but Henry is 2nd after Didier
He made 3 goals and 2 assists yesterday against Bochum. Remarkable striker!
Or his english has become more clean or my gibberish has evolved.
Wherever he went , he should of left Tottenham 5 years ago ,, wasted !
Henry always has the last laugh 🤣
and a few days later - he drops and delivers a magnificent pass to sane :)
Wheres Michael gone dawg
Don't worry Harry, German is my mother tongue and I also did not understand WTF Carragher was saying the first time
5:45 penaldog cant relate 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
was Jamie trying to say Viel Glück?
Kane is just lovable ❤❤💯
What did Kane say after the red and white comment?
more goal contributions that haaland this season 8g 2a vs 8g 4a, kane is underrated as hell
what a difference in Harrys personality and persona since leaving spurs. its almost like the shackles have been cut off, nice move harry
Everytime Henry says "Harry" it sounds like he just said Henry.
not that good though are they were awful at the minute and 4.3 to a team dominating there league every year and smashing arsenal 9.2 on agg couple years ago not that bad. 😂😂😂
Man said Frantic
Striker who played exactly the same as him was berbatov. Just berba was a team player and not a golden spoon fed striker. Also as a United fan Henry is the best striker the prem has ever seen.
Harry Kane is a real English gentleman!
Obviously he wanted to go to Manchester United for sure
He was never able to say "obviously we are one of the favorites" when he was at Tottenham.
For sure he wanted to go to Manchester United
And BAAAM, 3 goals and 2 assist in the very next Game 👋 greetings to Henry
Kane look like a player of the 90's but upgraded, he is so talented, he can do everything as henry said
Errr yean no why does he always start his interviews saying this...yeah obviously
Kane Has The Necessary Modesty, Humility, And Respect.
Thierry Henry what a plyr this man was. One of the best striker the EPL has ever seen.Absolute legend. ❤😍
Did I just miss the questions about the Oktoberfest??😮
Wie der einfach Fußball sagt😘  nix Soccer   Football....Es ist Fußball...😘
What did he say guys can anybody translate?
Go on harry💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼 so happy for you bro 👏👏👏
Harry kane is showing bayern how good he is since leaving Tottenham bc he needs to win something, not trying to diss Tottenham I think it was best for both Kane and Spurs to go there separate ways, Kane to play in the champions league and Spurs to start a new era
Should of left tottenham at 26/27
Thierry spitting facts
Gooner twxt who bottled it when it mattered.
That's nice from you guys
He will finish one of the all time English greats. He's got something like 8 goals in 7 games with 4 assists for Bayern so far and I still think he's not got above third gear yet. Kane, Saka, Foden and Bellingham can do so much damage for England at the Euros next year if Southgate lets them off his leash just a little bit.
Yes Harry will look good in Arsenal shirt 👀
Why is carra shouting
Did kane improve his english in germany? Did they make him speak more clearly 😂
"Team you considered going too", Kane had plenty of chances to join United and never did. Why would he go to United when Bayern come calling? The media byist towards Man United is embarrassing.
6:34 who farted there ?
Sorry,  this guy needs to go and look at the Real R9 and will realise someone done that way before harry.
A bit of banter from Harry
jaimie never seen benzema play 😭😂
Harry Buddy take Sonny to BFC to help you. He is much better than Coman is.  And I hope Harry's german will be more understandable than his english is😅
2:33 Can't blame Harry for not understanding this cryptic message though. Viel Glück beim nächsten Versuch Jamie <3
40goals +this season
Is it weird that Henry's English is so much easier for me to understand than Carragher's?
henrys famous last word "youooo loooooke goode in red and white"
I can understand carra more than kane
You can tell all Henry wants to do is Banter Kane lol.
Moving to Germany made him fluent in English!
Harry looks so free and happy without the Levy handcuffs. Good for him.
i hate him dropping as a number 10. let him cook, in goals. Put a Xavi, Iniesta Busquet behind Kane he will score 50/season. I want him scoring not dropping deep. Go buy your midfielders if you are lacking.
That pissed harry off, hes defo gona win the champions league now to shut jamie up🤣🤣
Kane not a goal scorer 😂 he drops but still scores so many
2:33 what
6:08 Wayne Rooney mate.
I love harry eventhough im a gunner fans   I wish he will come back to arsenal
Why does every English player answer a question by saying “yeah, no” makes absolutely no sense!
The guys German pronouncation was horrible ;D  Zero chance for Kane to understand that mess!
" we are one of the favourites " that golden feeling.
Just imagine Leverkuzen keep going like that and Kane goes another season without a title 😂
Ya know 😂😂😂
Kane has been one of my favorite players. And I said this as an Arsenal fan. Now it’s easier to admit 😄 You are welcome to join our club Harry after you have won a trophy with Bayern. Then you can win trophy with us.
Harry Kane does suit Red & White.  Perhaps he would suit a move to Liverpool or Manchester United in a couple years time?
Have you ever heard about Wayne Ronney, Carra?
6:30 what were those noises? 💨🤔
Rooney done what kane does he dropped back playmaker and bang in goals for jokes!
Can't compare Kate and Henry 😂😂
Henry is coach of France espoirs and still pundit ???? OK
If he’s world class player how comes he’s won nothing for his national team
If bayern wins the champions league harry kane will finally win some silverware
Yes,no, obviously!😂😂
It’s so refreshing to finally appreciate and enjoy Harry Kane’s football now he’s left Spurs 😂. Hope he wins the Bundesliga title!
I’m surprised Carra knows even a sniff of German 😂
Brilliant. Harry's loving it. A great move for him. Some very sore Spurs fans back here 😂
Wow his German is fantastic already
Haven’t seen Harry Kane this happy for over 10 years. Finally getting rid of spurs has massively lifted his spirit.
"Obviously"
Henry is a legend 😂😂
Best striker in the world
Best crew⚡️
Where's Micah
Where's Micha?
Thierry Henry savaging Tottenham again. Priceless™️
The disrespect for the Bundesliga and Bayern by the hosts is noticeable.
CBS is so much fun
I see what you did there theiry!
Obviously
yea obviously
Kane to drop back? Sorry Henry. That’s why you’re not a coach anymore
Hahaha! Such a joker.
Rooney used to do what Kane is doing Mr Carragher
"Bayern, Bayern uber alles." United must be kicking themselves for not getting Kane.
Thierry
Always nice to see a young man get to talk to his hero
So robotic in his answers
Wayne Rooney dropped back into a number 10 role eventually as well but okay
I'm such a simp for Henry, even the way he says Harry. Bro says Aarreeee
City is my team but I've always had a liking for Kane's play. He gave Tottenham all he could. I'm glad he is having a good start at a new club! I hope he can pick up some trophies and have a great venture there
6:31-6:35 is someone about to follow through?!
Wth I can understand him now!
Him still saying we when talking about tottenham is class!
It's not always just the money, join us, we need a striker!! 🤡🙄
Did he tried saying "viel glück in München?" and then laugh like thinking he said it in perfect german?
Still calling Spurs 'We' , a legend ❤
A LITTLE BIT OF LIFE IN KANE WOW
You saw in the England game, if you let him drop all the way to mid line, he'll pick a pass even if not in transition!
Never seen a player do that before … off the top of my head Wayne Rooney , teddy sheringham, Dennis bergkamp
Carragher must have blocked recent Real madrid vs liverpool oppositions from his memory because he's already seen other number 9 that play 10 before...
Uh, what did he say???
Love him, he's so good
That "Viel Glück" was so bad pronounced, i dont think Harry will get there (will be able to understand it).
I wish we could watch this show in the UK :(
Wayne Rooney often made a similar switch from 9 to 10 at Man Utd towards the end of his career, and damn was he good at it!
Harry should have said.. 'sorry jamie i understood the german better than scouse' 😂 😂
They hurt him so much 💔
Nice interview 😊
More public spurs bashing by ex players and pundits. 🥱
God bless us all
Never seen a player drop deeper and play a no.10? So Rooney was non existent was he??
Best football show, love the team
kane is litterally worthless. Tottenham is way better without him and bayern does not need him. Good sell from tottenham.
Harry Kane what a player, absolutely so underrated 🔥👏🏾
United are rubbish from top to bottom
Jamie makes a great point about Kane's development and adapting his game as time (age) progresses. But am I right in saying the Rooney did something similar at United toward the end of his career by dropping in to the No. 10 role more?
Don’t want him to drop back it’s the biggest peeve I have with Kanes game for England
am happy for kane hope he settles down well
His english has improved since his to germany
Im happy he's not a spurs player now, I don't feel bad about liking him lol
Harry Kane is the perfect blend of Alan Shearer and Teddy Sheringham. He can play 9 and 10. He’s the best 9.5 in world football.
Harry Kane is speaking pretty normally now.
Love Harry and although it pains me to say it, Thierry was a very special player - lovely bloke as well.  COYS
I like kane now 😂 he even looks happy now too but what do we think of Tottenham…? 💩
He said We started the season well —> and meant Spurs😂 in his ❤ he‘s still at Spurs
❤
Why people always bully him in a comment about how he speak? He is a good speaker base on this interview. Clear words spoken.
A scouser talking deutsch😂😂😂😂👍🏼
Him still referring to spurs as “We”
I'm not Bayern fan, but cool seeing Kane. Real professional, not arrogant like that empty CR7, and bullies like Ramos, Zlatan,
I actually really enjoyed seeing Kane be allowed to be himself. He seems free and with less pressure on his shoulders. Happy for him, I hope they win a few trophies.
Jamie is only supporting Henry because he doesn’t want to be beaten-up! 🤣
Never seen a player do that except Wayne Rooney who literally did that no.9 dropping into no.10 role 😂 probably the most successful at it
Carra never seen Wayne Rooney before?
Kane knows Hows powerful the Name Bayern is  But at the moment Team isn't on best Form sadly
2:33 I'm german and even I dont have a clue what he talked about
Kane to arsenal here we go
Bu the looks of it he likes it in Germany...for sure
His in Micky mouse league 😂 and spurs have done better without him 😂
Love that he still says we when he talks about Tottenham
Kane does look good in red and white 😁
Everytime I hear Carragher's or Micah's high pitched laugh, I feel attacked. Henry is the only good thing here.
Also his English totally improved in german😂
Henry classless as always
“He almost drops as a number 10 and can play both positions I’ve never seen that before” has he never seen Wayne Rooney play 💀🤣
Man utd A  team he considered going too? 😂😂😂😂 nice try British media!
A full strength Bayern team beat a very depleted Man Utd team 4-3. Kane scored a penalty that shouldn’t have been given. A silly mistake by Onana for another goal. A full strength Man Utd would have beaten them easy
Where is Micah we want our guy back. Carra’s attempt at saying “viel Glück in München” was class .
Can someone PLEASE explain me the " Harry Kane cant speak english" joke?  Thats the first time i hear him talk and i dont see anything wrong with his english lol
Good to hear Harry Kane is still learning the language, and then he has to learn German too
Simple Henry’s an Arsenal man for life so he’s the main man who know the REAL truth! 💯
King with the jokes 😂
Ja, offensichtlich
We need subtiles when jamie carraguer speaks
The biggest football mistake in my life was that I didn’t go to the France WC 2006 training camp in my small town. Even 10mins away. All my friends got to see Henry and got things signed + Trezeguet, Zizou etc. I didn’t even know they were just 10mins away from me. Thierry is like LeBron is for my a real Hero in my life. Everytime I see this guy my heart gets warmed.
From my fav player all time to my teams hope Harry Kane former player of my rival team. Feels weird to cheer for him. But Jamie is wrong Henry did play a 10 type and 9 type too. Look how many assists he had in one season. Was the Prem record until Özil broke it
Coach Thierry
Never seen before what Kane does? And Benzema all those years at Real Madrid?
Brilliant analysis
Never seen that from a striker before Carra? Was there never a Wayne Rooney no??
funny thierry you should do stand up
The English bias. Carri says has not seen anyone do what Kane does. I guess Benzema and Suarez have been playing tennis all these years.
I do respect Carragher as a pundit, but to suggest that no other number 9 has dropped deeper as they enter the latter stages of their career, is poor. Rooney did it long before Harry.
What part of Germany are you living in Harry?..
Kane finally learned to speak English
Best crew & football show
If you squint your eyes, he's almost still in  a spurs shirt
Text to him... ones a gooners🔴⚪
Harry Kane has been a world class striker for about a decade now and I really hope he wins as mamy trophies as possible with Bayern Munich. A player of his quality deserves winners medals around his neck.
So that's what true Liverpudlian sounds like..
Still says we when talking about spurs hahaha
From One Gunner to Another 🔴
Wrong choice for him to go to bayern
Jamie said he never seen no9 who started a career scoring goals and making great assists as a traditional striker and later evolving into a no10 playmaker.. urmmm hello??!! Have you never seen Wayne Rooney for Man Utd? 😂😂😂
Great having a fluid conversation without Micah Richards buffooning everything up. Football first.
be interesting to see how the UK media treat him with regards his German going forward as they did with Bale and his Spanish speaking, even tho at the end when he left he proved that he spoke spanish much better than people thought
let 3 goals in against a terrible man u team lool wont make the last 16
Did anyone ask Henry about his disgraceful handball against the Republic of Ireland
If Jamie's talking in english he doesn't understand him either
4:58 Their laughs say it all.😂😂
what a player harry kane hope he scores a ton of goals in munich
Kane looks so much more rejuvenated and radiant.
As an Arsenal fan, I am glad he moved to BM and win some trophies...just imagine him playing against Tottenham in the Champions League 😂
man city say you are not goning to the final
Does Jamie squeeze out a few farts at 6:30??
why he sounds like the english version of cbum
Jamie's german pronunciation was awful I don't blame Harry for not even attempting to understand it
Did y’all hear the fart?🤭🤣
The Liverpool accent even makes German sound like gibberish
Harry Kane is a Legend! :)))
Wayne rooney was a CF that dropped to midfield…
@6:30 this guy realy farted on air wtf! hahah🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thiery thinks he is funny !!
Brilliant interview Henry n Carra respect to Kane I like him now #COYG
6:14 Karim Benzema
Glad we wont be facing him in the North London derby 😮‍💨
I’m English myself, but why do people say “fink” instead of “think”..? It’s mainly London accents that say it the most, but it’s still f**king embarrassing!
Harry rooting up for Tottenham in the north London derby.... shows how much he loves Tottenham....his boyhood club.....but sadly Tottenham couldn't help him win a trophy yet.....hope he wins one with Bayern!❤️
Harry Kane is better than Benzema .
Kane answers like any politician
What about Bellingham scores every time for Real Madrid.
Carra saying he has never seen a striker drop back... does he not remember playing against Rooney ?
I like Thirty's watch 🥰
The Champions League returns and Thiery Henry also returns with his endless brands of luxury watches on show. Love it. Especially the piece he has on him 😅
Cbs will bow down to man utd.. Mark my words
Best coverage out there at the moment
Talibans vs Israel in the weekend nld
Carra shouts as if he’s speaking directly to him, no mic, thousands of miles away… 😂
Carragher saying he never seen that before? Has he ever played against Rooney? lol
Lewandowski used to do that too. Dropped deep and bring the ball up
Some huge similarities between Henry and Kane. Both left the club they love to chase European glory having both lost a final. Henry completed his mission. Can Harry?
I am German and could hardly understand what Carragher was saying either.^^
He looks happier indeed. And yes much better in white and red.
Thierry is funny 😂
Never take any comments from cheaters seriously. Arrogance personified, kane is a great player, proven for any club he plays at including his england duties. United forever.
He's just a class act. Great lad.
Kane saying “we” when talking about Tottenham just shows deep deep down he didn’t want to leave, but felt like he needed to for his career.
Harry Kane is a phenomenal striker, but Thierry Henry is not only the best striker in Premier League history but the best player in Premier League History... how anyone who watched him play could dispute this is beyond me.
Why is carra shouting like  there is a tiny microphone on the Big screen directly to Harry kane ? 😂
Pro athletes should receive training on how to be interviewed.  Harry is a smart guy and a pretty good interview in general, no worse than any other footballer, but he doesn't really take care to hear the question, and answer it.  He did reasonably well with Jamie's question before wandering into fluff, but he just kind of bounced off Thierry's question and strayed into the comfortable "it's early days, I'm feeling good" prattle.
Harry, please stop saying "ya know"
Best version of Harry we have seen in terms of personality. Finally with a team he can be proud to he in. Happy for him
2livin legends joking with each other....an Carra; what more do u have t brighton a dreary Wednesday night.. Oh Micah?  Big H; top bloke right t the end. Wishing him all the best.. Arsenal fan
how can carragher say he never seen a player drop in to receive the ball and make a pass! so he's never watched Wayne Rooney play a game of football your saying?
Re ;Henry comment t Hazza. *U can take the boy outta Arsenal but not the Arsenal outta the lad;* Sure he looks gooood in red cos deep down good ol Hazzas a gooner at heart.
Carra, a Liverpudlian trying to speak German is hilarious; Hazza may look GOOOODin red Thierry but not as GOOOOD as u. True gooner thru an thru.
How can anyone not like Ol Hazza he pure class even off the pitch. A true gentleman to the end. Wishing him every success at Bayern ( as long as he doesn't score gainst US).
Good ol Hazza; pure Class A off the pitch as well as on.
Lol
0:47
Where is Sir Micah?
Arsenal supporter since 1997 ...but I'm honestly happy for Harry Kane!!reminds me of RvP!!😂😂😂😂 left to win trophies!!
Notice how he said "WE" even when he left 😁
Well obviously
Tottenham
There is secret in terry's laugh😂😂
There is a secret in terry's laugh😂😂
There is a secret in terry's laugh😂😂
Kane at Barca wouldve been a better fit than Lewy coz Kane is being asked to do what Lewandowski did for 10 odd years at Bayern and Lewy is being asked to do something at Barca that Kane had been doing for spurs since long.
Good to see that harry kane has started to learn english
As a Tottenham fan I’m so glad he left because we seem to always do good when he’s injured
Hope hewinns the champleague
The Bants! 😂
Kane is so Funny Man !😂😂
Kane needs the ease RL9 once had at Bayern
Pretty sure wazza dropped deep and was still world class as he got older!
never seen that before cough cough wayne rooney ?
Jamie - Shaq | Titi - Chuck | Meek - Kenny | Kate - Ernie
Henry and Kane two greatest strikers in premier league banter between them good to see
Harry Kane would have scored 40+ in the Barca team Henry played Carragher
You guys are the best. You really like to make viewers laugh. 😂😂😂
Harry ❤😊
Jamie there was one striker that used to play nine and 10 role the name Sergio Aguero
Never saw a player go from a 9 to 10 did he never watch Rooney
Thierry Henry is right, Harry does look good in red and white.
Wow his German is great, I don't understand a thing but great to hear the improvement
He should have left the Spuds long ago.. wasted all those years.
Kane is special but on carras point about never seeing a #9 drop and create like him I gotta say Rooney was doing that just as well
that haalaand shade 6:00
2:34 I speak German and I have no idea what the guy is saying.
hes the only player I would use to fill Lewandowski spot... Harry is the man...
Imagine speaking German in a scouser accent..
Man is epitome of proffesionalsm, properness and gentlemanliness. Already a legend in my pov
Thierry Henry was good enough to fill the positions of a winger and a striker in one game, Kane was good enough to fill the positions of a striker and an attacking midfield , giving you the creative power of a midfielder/winger and also the goal threat of an elite striker  Henry’s clear tho >>>>
Wayne Rooney became a number 10 at UTD when he started getting older? its been seen loads of times in the PL over the years
Bro is happy now from playing with richarlison to jamal musiala
Harry Kane leaves England and suddenly develops a more relaxed, outgoing personality? Who'da thunk it??
Carra saying he’s never seen a striker drop deep and play 10? Benzema??
Sully is the Top G😊
Kane looks happier
I always love to watch this team in the studio talk. Always put smile on my face. Its sad Micah isn't here for this one
Yes l, Henry and Kane are different players. But Harry is more similar to Rooney in a sense where he can do it all!
i am arsenal fan but i happy to see harry kane to win some trophy . you know what i mean
Jamie had to pick Thierry. He used to have nightmares about trying to stop him! 😂
Harry still calls Tottenham “We”
Kane didnt have red hair this time 😂
He has never seen a striker dropping so deep and play everywhere number 10 , that carragher typical English player. KB9 Infront of yours year In year, he Gon just deny with a ballondor
Dreamy
Where is Micah???  The show is not the same without him!!
i enjoyed that interview with Kane
Jamie carragher trying to be funny is the cringiest thing
Kane is a great player, but for Carragher to LIE and say he has never seen any other number 9s drop and play as 10's is laughable. Rooney, Benzema, Firmino & that's just off the top of my head.
Are you happy with this joke? Highlight of your month or your year?
Carragher never seen Rooney play 🤣
Where is Micah? 🥲
🤣🤣🤣
필드골도 못 넣어놓고 뭐가 좋다고 해벌쭉이냐
Strange score considering how good Bayern are atm and how god dam awful Utd are
Where’s big michz?
Right now,I can understand Harry Kane english
All of a sudden I can hear him clearly
I see hes been picking up the german lingo from jurgen klopp.. for sure
*WE* started the season well 🤍
“We’ve never seen a striker drop deep into midfield before”…. Meanwhile Wayne Rooney sits at home wondering where Carragher picks up all this from.
Not the same without Micah
Well happy for this lad and he’s a great ambassador for english players abroad
U can literally put this man in every team and he wouldn’t change his style and would still score 25+ goals a season, what a player he is
Please win so much trophy harry for your personal cabinet❤❤❤❤❤❤
First time ive seen harry have a laugh probably coz he aint at the spuds anymore 😂
His English is improving in Germany. Quite paradoxical 🤣😅
The king 😂
You can see Thierry having to concentrate extra hard to understand Carra's English😅
He looks very happy!!! Well done Harry
I'm German and even I had to rewind to figure out what Jamie tried to say in German. I didn't even know it was supposed to be German when I heard it the first time 🤣
Carra’s German is better than his English😂😂😂
As a arsenal fan finally 👏 I can really enjoy this guy as the star 🌟 he is. tt got it bang on.
Bless H, what a sweetheart. He deserves a chance to cook with a team who can create chances for success. Am sure he misses England (especially Son & Gareth) though.
0:55 Titou cracked himself up💀
Do I hear a German accent on Harry?
Class act
Bruh where Micah at wtf
how he move to Germany and gets better in English
As a german i really struggled to understand that „viel Glück” (good luck)haha  In germany „viel” is spoken similar to the english „feel”
WHERE IS BIG MEEKS !!!!!!!
How many other top English players should have challenged themselves abroad and develop their skills? Rooney could and should have played in Germany or Spain. Who else?
Kane dodged a massive bullet signing for Bayern instead of Man U.
Harry Kane is such a modest n humble guy...He has adopted well in Bayern Munich.. Already scored numbers of goals since he joined e German club!!! What a man!!!
The king henry
Bro is genuinely happy.
6:30 carra leaves a double fart!!!😂😂 the first one is quiet and he smiles, but the second one is louder so him and kate burst out laughing lmaooo
''We started the season well''
Parece mentira que hayas jugado en el fcbarcelona y no te enteras que el fcbarcelona es club líder mundial en champions con 46
How on earth is his English better now when he plays and lives in Germany
Wait why I can understand this? compared to all of his old interviews I cant even understand anythin he sayin till now.
Jamal musiala is a beast
never seen it before? in Rooney's twilight he turned into a 10. look at the legendary RVP header, was inch perfect from the half way line.  Harry is amazing, but hes not unique in being a striker that can play deeper as a playmaker.
‘We’ started the season well, one of our own
06:33 Was that a stealthy toot I just detected?
You cut Kane he bleeds Tottenham 😂 what a guy
The CBS team isn't complete without Big Meeks, where is he and why is he not with the guys?
As a fellow Arsenal fan I love Henry & Kane!! Both lifelong Arsenal fans!!
i LOVE THIERRY
Henry might left Arsenal, but Gunners in him never left. Once a gunner always a gunner.
Kane looking fresh. Been in the trenches for so many years. Damn, those Sp*r!
Kane breaking out of his robot state 😅
6:34 💩
I was pissing myself laughing 😂😂😂
That was so funny ! 😂
All that money you'd think he would find some better teeth.
Rooney was that playmaker/striker
Love this man
Stop the rot #tenhagout 🛑
As an Arsenal fan - I wish him all the best -
Great move for Harry. Easier league, better team. Win win.
Plottwist: Spurs win the league Bayern lose the bundesliga
Micah's barber called in sick so he refused to go on.😂
Red and white in Munich also on return in few years time keep  with the red and whites and join the best team in premiership over next few years and watch u take over every where we go !
Happy for Harry. He was stuck in the mire that is Tottenham in England.
Kane, one of the two best strikers in the Premier league ever? British marketing???
we’re is my man
Carra just ignoring Rooney doing everything Kane can do and more as a 9, he didn’t start as a 9 at united because he could play anywhere and that meant fergie knew he could play him elsewhere and still get the same out of him but also play others in their preferred position and get the best out of them too, had he been able to play up top his whole career he’d probably have broken shearers record.
Thierry said it cause he remembers Kane saying" I will never leave the Spurs"😂
Looking very well, and happy! So pleased for him. COYS!!!!!!
Carra is so different on here compared to Sky Sports 😂
Giroud defiantly very similar play style to Kane, ability to drop deep, hold up play amazing link up play. I think Giroud goes under the radar always been a quality striker
3:54 - I love that he said "We started the season well" instead of "They started the season well". Once a yid, always a yid! 🤍
Man City will smash Bayern
I just found out Kate is 42
Love how Titi still hates Spurs !!! KING
Saying “we” referring to Tottenham still 😢
Why is Jamie "spitting" Carragher shouting?
So Jamie has never seen Rooney? Lol he literally described Rooney. A Centre Forward who slowly morphs into being a playmaking false 9/ 10. Obvi probably just an oversight, i bet if someone mentions Rooney he wouldve realized, he definitely has seen a player like Kane.
Has he had English lessons..
I'm happy for him to move there. he gonna waste all his time and talent if he stay at Tottenham, and retired without UCL/League trophy. Hope Sonny join him.
He is a pro Kane do your best 💪🏽
eat banana henry------var is a joke
Wait, where's Micah?
Even I, as a German who is not a Bayern fan, can only say that Harry Kane is an absolute enrichment for the Bundesliga, both as a person and as a footballer.
Henry would have looked well in orange in a chain gang. A fate wished upon him by every Irishman since  2009 👊😂
My pick of 4 teams in semifinals are City, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern.
The One who got away 🔴⚪
The Kane glaze is well deserved
it does make sense why he doesn’t drop as much, they play with musiala who’s a number 10 and like kane said at times they’d play as like 2 10’s but if u want anyone to be on the end of chances it’s kane
CBS best UCL coverage, NBC best premier league coverage what a time to be alive!
Has he ever done a interview without saying obviously
Viel Glück im München! 😂😂😂 Jamie is a legend! Love him!
You mean he looks good in red and white again!
harry is a lovely humble man ..top pro
Notice how Kane still says “we” when referring to Tottenham. You can tell how much he loves the club.
The fact that he can go to Germany and out of his confort zone with his qualities to grow as a player puts him way above most PM players
He’s wearing a “Reversed” arsenal kit 😂
Now I’m starting to think why everyone takes the piss out of his speech.
I have a feeling tuchel will get sacked this season 🧐🤔
Obviously means “offensichtlich” in German Harry….yeah obviously
As a arsenal fan .. harry kane was the only part of spurs game i loved to watch <3
Kane should have moved years ago…he’ll never have a top champions league goal record because of it. He would have been right up there if he did move
Kane is more active, he goes to defense immediately and creates chances like a true CAM. He was like this when Mourinho was managing the Spurs he is imo the best 2-way striker in a very long time. Truly unique player
i did get the red and white joke 10 seconds later OMG Thierry you are Legend
how to perfectly answer questions and not fall into traps
Harry Kane is one of them players who is loved beyond rivalries.
I think you wrongly wrote Kate's name in the description. Adbo instead of the valid Abdo.
Regarding Thierry asking Harry if he is frustrated because he not dropping deep - That's like wanting Harry to start a media argument with Bayern management. Harry has recently arrived to Bayern and is finding his feet in new surroundings. He's trying to adapt to his new environment. That question is better put to Tuchel - about how best to utilize Harry's talent.
😂❤️
The ref gave him gift
What Language does speak Carraguer ????
Love Kane in red and white.
yes, but the wrong red and white.
🟥⬜️ is also Bari's colour. Thierry Henry was stronger even if Harry Kane wins the Champions. Henry was the best in season 03 04 Arsenal's unbeaten Premier League and brought Arsenal to the final of Champions League in 06 and was leading but that Barcelona was too strong, maybe the best Barcelona and club players ever, they had Ronaldinho, Messi, Eto'o, Xavi, Iniesta, Puyol... it was even unthinkable they were under but Messi was injured and was 18
6:18 Benzema also. That's why  Real Madrid should have bought Kane to replace him.
That joke by Thierry is double edged. You look good in red and white. Bayern or arsenal, spurs fans  should take one.
Can’t believe he FINALLY left Spurs. Even feels kinda weird. 😂
Jamie, just because he's in a different country, as a result of modern technology you don't have to shout so he can hear you.
Diversity top of the agenda at CBS but Gallagher shouting is too much 🤮🤮🤮🤮😡
Lest we forget Henry’s hand ball moment against ireland when he cheated for France and got away with the cheating, worst cheating move i’ve ever seen in soccer since maradonna
There are so many Arsenal fans who are happy to stop pretending that Harry Kane is a bad striker now that he's a Bayern player, and I am one of them.
Kane is always contributing to his team. A true professional. Even as an arsenal fan, I want him to win some trophies because he deserves it.
God i love Thierry Henry :D This Guys is so damn funny :D
Kane even talks better. Seems more confident and happy.
Notice how harry still says "we" when talking about spurs? Great guy. Will always be one of our own
I love how Henry introduced himself as if Harry might mistake his voice for Carra 😂😂
@2:34 perfect response from Harry 🤣
Shame he wasted his life at spurs and didn’t even get to break the record. Should have moved 5 years earlier or stayed.  Hope he wins the UCL, he really deserves it but I feel Bayern are a little weak at the back. If Man Utd can get 3 then a good team could outscore them.  Gonna have to improve by the new year, but still got the win & that should effectively see them through this round. They should make mince meat out of Galatasaray & Copenhagen; they’ll effectively be through after 3 matches.
Hate when people call him world class. Pen taker is his best trait
Jamie is such a Titi fanboy that's ridiculous)
jamie mate... no need to shout! You've got a mic on lad, and he's got earbuds in
"Everyone knows what I think of Tottenham"
I’ve always loved Harry. I wish him all the best at Bayern.
Wish him all the best, top player, top bloke 👏🏻
I understood Kane English without subtitles 😮
Spot on question from thierry henry and carra
Carra is acting like he didn’t describe Benzema the same way he did Harry 😂. Kane is a legend no doubt though, but carra slays does this about players lol
He looks happy.. Great move go and enjoy sme good football
Thierry asks quality and qualified questions, most pundits are trying too hard to be interesting
Can somebody put subtitles on his interviews lol
Wow! I never expected his English to have improved this much🤯
I forgive him for play for Tottenham 🙌🏾
Jamie Carragher never saw a number 9 who dropped to the number 10 role to make the play. Im younger than him and I saw Wayne Rooney do the same trough his whole career, Karim Benzema style of playing trough his whole career.
Kane is such a modest guy. Humble and polite. You seriously can't hate him. He's such a gentlemen
I’m so fickle man.Harry seems like a nice bloke and family man dunno what my problem was 🙊😅🤣
Imagine if Kane goes to Arsenal after Bayern Munich
Kane’s a legend, but he’s definitely not the first to do that. Wayne Rooneys been slept on for too long
Never seen it before?? Where’s carragher been living, Totti, Bergkamp, Cantona just off the top of my head who were strikers who dropped deeper and were also great playmakers.
Harry Kane is very professional in hw he answers his questions
Why Kane says if it was Thierrys decision?
what is Jamie Carragher saying, he's never seen a player do what Harry Kane does in terms of evolving from being a goalscoring to dropping deep and being number 10. i could swear, Wayne Rooney was and became just that.
How dare you cut off Jesus to talk to harry. 😂😂😂❤
The champions league clearly lacks quality this year...no Messi, no Ronaldo, no Benzema, etc etc when you think that Kane plays in the same position as Ronaldo Phenomeno then it would be a joke even to compare....
Honestly carra, you have never seen a number 9 playing like a number 10 before, 😂😂😂 English guys can be a joke!   Better than harry kane is doing, was how benzema played all his life, ohhhhh 😮 sorry you never watched him play 🤣🤣
You look good in red n white 😂😂😂
If Carragher hadn’t seen a top striker dropping to midfield and become a playmaker, perhaps ask him to watch Rooney!
Harry kanes answer... 'Tottenham of course, we've started well"  Hes still tottenham through & through 🤍💙
So Pretty
Where's Micah when you need him 😆😆 this would have been gold
Does anyone know where you can watch this like what app is cbs coz these lot are too funny
Before Mourinho Harry Kane was a goal scorer. Before Mourinho Benzema was a goal scorer. Both are now lauded as the best number 9's in the world for their evolution, taking them to new heights. Praised. If Benzema was English he would be idolized as a deity. Put some respect on Mou.
Same thing Poop, I mean Pep, did to you Titi at Barfa, I mean Barca.
Onana saved united's a*s after that blunder. Look at how many shots on goal bayern had. Defenders didn’t do sh*t. It would've been 8-3 without onana's performance in the second half.
0:07 the team you considered joining.... she can't help but roast him 😂😂
Harry looked really relaxed and happy. Like anything in life it can often come to the point when it’s time for a change and we have to make the head or heart decision. Head said go and heart was stay. The head usually makes the right decision. It’s appeared to have worked out fine for both him and Tottenham , the same as it does in life.
Harry Kane is a real number 9 who can score and pass is the one that every team wants to get hold of
Harry seems a lot less thick since he left Shite Hart Lane 😜
Kane is a top player and top guy
3:56 amazing how harry said "we started the season well" when he doesn't play for tottenham anymore
Miss big Meeks 😢
Where is miach ?
fact he said "we started the season well" mentioning spurs...
where is Micah?
yeah obviously
Where is Micah...? Am I the only who misses him in this crew?
Man looks revitalised. He could be there a long time in the Muller role.
Is Harry being dubbed to English? I'm sure in England it sounded like he was talking Germanish 😅😂
Kane and Carragher,  can't wait for the SportTalk interview
Wayne rooney is better than hary kane .
"we started the season well"
carra mate,  wayne rooney literally did what harry kane is doing right now. playing in that number 10 position.
finally a Happy Kane
Such a down to earth dude! Love him
He seems like a proper lad. All the best Harry ! Coming from a United fan here.
Kane is upgrade Lewandowski because he is a better all round player with more weapons, but also scores many goals.
Cool to see an Arsenal & Spurs legends banter a little- showing some personality
Henry and Kane are no way at all the same. Henry had it all. Run from deep and score. Kane can’t do that. But what Kane can do without speed is link up well. He will be like Rooney in the later years and drop deep with pinpoint passes. We seen that at Spurs. Both phenomenal players but Henry was on another level.
3:54 he says “we started the season well” what a legend. He still loves Tottenham and it’s very wholesome to see, especially after the heartbreak I had this summer when he left 😭🙏
You've never seen someone play in the same style as Harry kane? Does Karim Benzema ring a bell , he's doing the same thing for a decade.   Oh carragher 😂
“I’ve never seen that before” Karim Benzema my guy.
Kane doesn’t need to drop deep at Bayern cos of the attackers around him especially Musiala. At Spurs, there was no #10 post Eriksen so it made sense for him to drop deep.
4:58 Im a Spurs fan, but even I was about to say THAT lol
i dont understand why people think his english is bad. im not even from england and i can understand him just fine
it was frentich!
Anyone else hear the back-to-back farts at 6:30 and 6:34?
Harry English got improved after he moved to Germany😂
He looks so much happier now. If only he wife moves to Munich too.
Carrigher talking rubbish , saying he has never seen a striker who drops deep and creates, Waza was the master of that for over 10 years constantly dropping deep and creating 🥴
Did she have to mention that Jesus part, some people are just plan foul ☯️
Honestly, if Harry Kane put aside his ego, he really suit Arsenal team & gameplay, he can win Premier League & Champion League with Arsenal.
6:08 -> Karim Benzema has been that player for years...
Kane even improved his English already 😂
Thierry to Harry - "You look good in red and white." Either Thierry is happy Harry didn't go to rivals Man U or he's trying to get Harry to play for Arsenal in the future or both haha
Feel bad for Harry. He should have moved 3-4 years ago to a bigger club. First time I am able to understand his English ffs. He is taking English classes there :P
Harry on spurs “we started the season well” one of our own
this is such  nice lad
We can say  harry is on is own 😢 tottenham hotspurs for life white heart 🤍 lane is our home 🏡
Against Ukraine recently when English players fail to feed Harry Kane he came to mid ans assist walker..this is kane all about❤❤
Such disrespect to Gabriel Jesus. Is this how a professional reporter behaves? What a severe lack in class.
Notice how kane still refers to tottenham as we when talking about the season. I know we like to banter that he was miserable at tottenham but he still loves the club.
I hope this man gets a trophy this season 🙏
i can see that Sonny picked up the way of speaking English from Harry Kane, "oviously".
Yeah, obviously
hate it😠
love you kane ,from indonesian❤❤❤
I'm happy for Harry
Why is Carra absolutely screaming?
Long overdue.  So good to see him happy, playing well, and on a squad and within a team culture that plays to win... expects to win.
Kane is like our Benzema 😢
He still loves Tottenham
I can finally understand Harry Kane
Harry Kane is the perfect striker for current Arsenal.
One of the best football interviews 2 fxcking legends💯
top top player. im gald hes at a great club.
I have to enable subtitles when Jamie start to talk😭
Obviously 😂
Were is Micah? Bring him back please 😂
"Of course Tottenham. WE'VE started the season well so it should be a great game"  He still tottenham to the core.
Yes Thierry, we all know what you think about Tottenham. 😏  Is the same thing we all think about 💩  Thank you.... 🎶 👏
Where is Micah ?
Kane looking like a South Park character 😂
Where's Micah!
So they finally get an interview with the man now, and decided to talk about the PREM ??? Really? that's what we're doing now ?  also how f*cking condescendent and petty some of the comments from Henry ....Bayern is a BIGGER club than 90 % of prem team only tied with Liverpool in history ... and even today Bayern did NOT play good, and scored 4 ....
He looks more relaxed now. Good for him.
when you leave your toxic job for a new company, good times Harry Kane
is the mics broken when he have spurs interviews before, or his english is clear and i can understand what he saying now . still rooting for arsenal win this weekend but happy for kane's career now that he stepping out of spurs and chasing for title with bayern
Miss my boi Micah honestly 😭
such a professional, so many teams missed out on this guy
really hope he get's major trophy, Harry Kane is a really good striker, he can do anything, he deserves a trophy.
Imagine Harry speaking in German 🤷🏻‍♂️
WE’VE Started well he’s still a YID
people make jokes about Kane not being the sharpest tool in the box. I think from a football perspective he is really smart. For a 9 to effectively play as a 10, which he's shown he has the football intelligence for many times over his career, he can read the game so well. I recon he'd make a great coach later on.
I really hope he wins stuff with them. He deserves it and seems like such a nice guy. And when he is done we will take him at Chelsea for a season or two ;-)
His english is better than Cassano's Italian.
Amount of disrespect to Jesus. 💀
Real madrid is coming for the one times CL champions.  REAL IS THE KING
0:40 is where Henry said Kane looks better in red and white.
Bayern is my German club so I agree with Henry
Imagine, Harry is pissed that his team almost squandered a game where Bayern should have been up by 4 or more goals.
I like Kane now he's left Spurs, always rated him but couldn't like him as a gooner.  Now, I'm a fan lol
Agree with Thierry. I’ve heard people say he was forced to start dropping deep because of his age and lack of pace. Even if that WAS the case, that’s one of the most beautiful parts of his game and the fans are missing out if Bayern don’t utilize that skill.
As a spurs fan I hope he wins ucl this year
Carragher, what about Wayne Rooney?
Bergkamp and Berbatov used to drop deep and assume play making responsibilities. Wayne Rooney too. And others.
Imagine how many Trophies Kane would have won at Arsenal
Somebody is missing
This show is pure vibes
Wow Kane's English pronunciation is so clear now 👏🏼⚽🔥
since he at bayern he imporve his english.i can understand wht he's speak now
Herny , a classical & legendary striker,  know asking such vital q, bravo
Kanes a gooner!
Yeah...obviously.
I noticed Harry said we've started the season well speaking about Tottenham
He is unironically easier to understand now in Germany.
Carra’s attempt at saying “viel Glück in München” was class 😂
someone please clip Henry’s “ You look good in red and white” comment 😂😂 and spam tottenham fans 🙏🏼
Harry Kane with a little more PnP is the perfect striker.
Never seen a 9 turn into a 10 and become a playmaker? Wayne Rooney would like a word.
Carragher is so over the top and trying too hard. He ruins the whole show.
Spurs tried to kill his career and now this man looks back at spurs laughing because they tried to kill his career and he found a way out of that pisshole
whould u all just relax, man u is just a mid table club
To Jamie's point at the end, I've always thought, especially during his later years with Spurs, that Kane was a superlative 9 1/2.
No looked better in white imo
never seen anyone like kane that can drop back and play with the ball? who is wayne rooney?
He will drop deep more and more, eventually as the season goes on. He's still gaining trust from other elite players, probably will get a good relationship with Sane and we'll see some crazy assists and pacey goals. I put Bayeern as No.2 threat in UCL
Won't win as leak too many goals.. just last 2 home games alone they've leaked 5
Harry is really trying with the language lessons now too. The word is he's already up to an intermediate level.... in English.
I don't like Spurs but i always loved Kane and Son
"Harry, how does it feel to be at a club with a trophy cabinet that isnt empty?"...... 😂😂
Thierry was a cracking player, among the EPL's best ever, but he's also a funny TV personality. It's SO hard not to love him and I don't even like Arsenal.
I wanted  him to  join Real Madrid but that didn't worked out.
no way this is the first time I understand what he said in english😭
Looks excited to play again got the love back for sure only good for England
His teammates didn't play him at all today
Why does kane sounds german all of a sudden lmao
Yeah ofisliy
English improved by Germany 😂
He’s finally understandable now
No micha 😢
More English players need to go abroad. Go dominate Europe. Go sign for the best teams.
This show has the best football hosts on the planet.
Bring Micah. Complete your squad CBS.
I can’t believe carra has become so cringe. I feel bad for harry hearing him and I’m lfc fan but this guy should be ashamed
KANE IS THE NEW BENZEMA not the first 9 to do it
Errmmm
This Panel is absolute Gold 😂🔥
The King 👑😆 #vavavoom #redandwhite
United ain’t making out of groups
I wish he stayed in the prem but I’m glad his at a team that guarantees trophies.
Great work guys, enjoyed every second
As a German i say finally he get some titles! I think he deserves it...
😂😂
Comparing Kane to the King is an insult 🤣
Kane will never feel at home Bayern Munich hence Levy locked in a buy back clause😂😂😂😂
Kane 💪🏼
Im so happy hes up to date to with tottenham and still supporting them despite being at bayern
As a South American, my first language is Spanish but respect that without subtitles this is the first time I understood Harry Kane
You bet your house he's gonna score from penalty  Kane has the ability to find the inside of side netting in such regularity that no goalkeepers would ever reach even if they go the right way
Spurs fan but you can't really hate Henry. Proper personality in football.
This CBS gang makes players always smile when they asked, fun to watch.
Micah been fired for bursting on to the scene too early
henry is so cringy
me as Arsenal fan, he is one of my favorite players
Ex gunner Thierry asking ex Spurs Harry who's gonna win this weekend between Tottenham vs Arsenal hahaha
No longer bottling his English 😲 a sign for good things to come
hes swapped obviously for FOR SURE lol
Credit to Man United they try to get back to the game and that was good
Top player still got another 5-6 good years left.
This is the most personality I’ve seen off Kane in 10 years 😂
So happy for harry Kane he deserve it!
Kane is an absolute blessing for Bayern contributing goals and assists, and having such a positive vibes all around 🙌 👏 ❤
Ive never seen that before hold on you saw benzema
Legends
I'm sorry, Jamie says he's never seen a striker like Harry kane drop deep and dictate play. Also someone who's playing deeper and deeper as a playmaker did he forget about wayne rooney. Man played everywhere across the front line and then into midfield
Worth every cent, just for Lifting Bayern's profile even more. If thats possible. A true destination club.
Go win those trophys and hurry home Harry!
Harry Kane changed the #9 position? I think Jamie forgot what Benzema did at Real Madrid.
Henry smashed it
Henry 'first and foremost' - Kane should steal that phrase much better than 'yeah, no obviously'.
Harry Kane does what Rooney did as he aged. Apparently Jamie didn’t watch united
Theirrys face at 6:32 😂
Yeah,no...🙂
Kane is a jack of all trades
I really miss Peter drury yelling KAANEE whenever he scored 😢
He’s still learning how to play with his teammates but he’s still making a contribution every game. What a player.
Dont forget that Harry Kane is a MOFU and a lisper
I hope he wins a trophy
He would do a job for us at Arsenal
Did Jaime just fart?? 6:32
i just really enjoy Thierry analyze the game at a high level while being entertaining at the same time. What a legend.
No chance!!!!!Man utd are chronic and they scored 3 against Bayern
2:32 🤣🤣🤣
Nice one Thierry 😂
Where is Richard? This show misses him
I have nothing against Kane, but I'm a little annoyed when I see him get all the spotlight.  He wasn't even that great this game.  Don't get me wrong, he's a top striker, but Sane or Musiala should be interviewed.  But I get it, he's the boy from England, so he gets the special treatment smh.
Where is Micah we want our guy back
Where's Micah we want him back
Kane speaks good English well now before he sounded like a constipated frog 🐸
I love how Henry loves the red and white so much still ❤
This guy improved his English 😭🔥 in Germany
How can you not like Kane, such a modest guy, great signing for Bayern!
Yeah obviously
Harry Kane is the goat!!!!  as a spurs fan i am so happy for him
english goat
Somehow his English got better at Bayern
I can finally love Kane without the rivalry 😅
Elite player at Elite club.
After watching that game Bayern are not that great either it's just that Man Utd are sh*t 💀💀💀
Where's Micah ?
his english definitely improved in germany
Bayern need to get a better keeper
Henry played 8 seasons in the premier league.  4 times top scorer   2 times European golden boot  Record for most assists in a single season.  All time top scorer for one of the biggest Prem teams.  Only player in the history of the prem to score 20+ and provide 20+ assists in a single season (only messi did this in the top 5 leagues)  Best Prem striker and player ever
Drop full videos
kaneglish
Bayern aint winning UCL. If that was the City they would have gotten rekt. 🤪
😂😂😂😂
