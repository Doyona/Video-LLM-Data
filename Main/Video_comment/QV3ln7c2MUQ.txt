Seeing people cheering Roman makes me so happy, this was the guy who used to be the most hated, but he stayed there, he kept doing it, and just look at him now ❤
7:15 does anybody notice how they try to sneak in roman's old theme

I’d rather have this ending, because now we know we in for a ride.
Love ❤❤❤❤😊
❤️❤️☝️☝️💞
If Vince was there....Cody would've definitely lost the match and his stature in Wwe. Vince hates the idea of  Rhodhes becoming champions for some reason.

Sorry. Cody cry babies. Its the tribal chiefs ara.
Roman reigns always play like aggresive but all time it's not good for roman. And if roman try to win this match without any cheating he has to lock cody rhodes
Cody rhodes is a skillful player so roman reigns should have to play like defensive
Now Cody era
I never saw roman winning one  sidedly
Best WrestleMania stage and stadium

Roman Reigns best in world no CM punk
Roman Reigns all time best wrestler ❤️

Thanks for 11 subscribe 😂😂
WWE Roman ☝️ ❤
Last year was less predictable and could've gone either way, but now that roman has already beaten cody last year, No matter what Triple H does he can't even genuinely fool a birds brain into sincerely believing that cody is losing twice.

Whst did reigns say at the end
Roman ❤❤❤
Captain America vs Aquaman (felt like)🎉
For someone who is one of the biggest Roman fans and never wants to see Cody win the big one from Roman, it's one of the greatest Main Event. I was having panic attacks throughout the match thinking Cody might win, and then when the bell rang, the relief was unmatched.
Only Roman reigns is the boss
Rhodes vs Reings 2 la Revancha en Wrestlemania 40
Bye bye Wrestlemania 39 and welcome Wrestlemania 40😢
Wwe WrestleMania 40 2024 for Roman Reigns vs Cody Rhodes is up want?
But codiroots is beast❤❤❤
Cody had the best view to witness Grandest entrance of all time
Only roman reigns time
Jimmy vs jey wrestlemania 40🔥🔥🔥😀😀
Just forcing Roman Reigns down to us will do no good. It was Cody's moment and he was better .
No one  in 2016 would ever thought stardust will headline wrestlemania
Don't worry Cody fans wwe saves his moment for wrestlmania40!! * 🔥
JUST WAIT TILL NEXT MONTH AND APRIL ROMAN
SHOULD HAVE FINISHED THE STORY
Whether its cody time or cody should have won the championship but when roman raise the belt paul heyman says you're wrestleMania  with the music ends always gives me chills
Real winner cody roman cheater
Bro I really don't understand why wwe is pushing roman reigns so much🙁🙁
Yooo wtf interferences in a wrestlemania match?
2:15 romans him icl
Roman Reigns took 3 and half years to beat Brock Lesnar did you guys really think that cody  can defeat roman Reigns
Roman Reigns only
Biggest cheater Roman reigns.. 😂😂
Everybody saying Cody loose infront of his daughter but you remember guys Chad Gable loose and got beaten infront his daughter in RAW and nobody cares about it you guys are all always overhyping the guy who used his late father as sympathy to gain fans and get overpushed and steals the spotlight of real talents and Chad Gable story still not ends and they keep it aside and everybody forgot and ok you guys keep dreaming of your overpushed Cody Rhodes
The finish is good because the guy who used his late father as a sympathy to get fans and overpushed person cannot dethrone Roman Reigns and it seems like a joke
He always been a cheater from  beginning
Roman Reigns is a big cheater
Wrestlemania 40 we want to see Roman vs seth title for title match at main event 🤩🤑
Cody cannot match the level of our Tribal Chief
Jobber Rhodezzz for ever
No way WWE or anyone for that matter could predict how popular Cody would become when he returned.
Only Cody Rods ❤❤❤ Romain reign always cheat
Cody is the best and his the winner in real roman reighn always cheated
Like for Roman
Roman love
WWE's biggest mistake was not to give the belt to Cody. Cody deserved this winning. WWE has become joke to me after this match and Romeign has become just a toy.
The final boss entry of tribal chief...❤❤🎉🎉🥵🥵 i am so happy to witness this one 🎉🎉
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
WrestleMania 40 - Roman Reigns vs Cody Rhodes one more time and this time cody will win championship
I pray for roman to win the crown jewel with la knight and should give his universal championship title in WrestleMania to Cody Rhodes because he deserves that more than anyone.
Cody debería ser el rostro de la compañía, qué desperdicio.
It's wrong that wwe didn't add traibal chief full entrance..
3:50 BACK BODY DROP THROUGH THE TABLE
6:42🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

Roman❤
Cody mérite la victoire Roman IS the noob kids
The Greatest of All Time
Roman reigns Best All time ❤
Roman deserves to be at the top. He defeated the all time greats. Even if he's the old reigns before the time of return he can defeat all these. He has defeated all these before. He's the greatest.
Reigns 🩸🐐
I want the full match
Aqui es cuando debio ganar Cody y haber terminado el reinado de Roman, luego de esto, fue totalmente apestoso todo. Tanto Roman como Cody pasaron a ser irrelevantes.
Cody got cheated he was the only one man who can beat Roman 1 on 1
One of the best matches - so damn good! Credits to Roman and Cody for putting everything on the line ❤
Roman chitter
Who's here after that staredown during smackdown 👀👀👀👀
I love Roman reigns
Whatever wins or lose.it's nature.i respect all wwe male superstars and female superstars that all are best.
no man in any existence can beat Roman reigns
Roman is SO awesome...   But LA Knight is taking those titles. It's gonna be a mugging.
People said this killed codys hype, but look at him now. His reactions are louder then ever. I think this was great
Nobody saw Cody and Jey becoming Undisputed Tag Champs😂
ROMAN EMPIRE FOREVER 🔥
Cody’s entrance was amazing the ohooo was loud 😂😂😂 unforgettable westlemaina match
His theme song is too good to stop listening 😂
Roman Reigns is awesome
5:36 Hes the opposite version of Charlotte flair

At this time I get it
I can't believe USOS lost the tag team champions
People forget the year before this Roman had finally beaten Brock at Mania, something that took almost a decade to happen. Also beat Undertaker at Mania, and as hot as Cody was, it was the right call for Roman to win. Cody’s time will come though, it just takes time and proper buildup
Roman king only wwe 🎉🎉
Real superstar of all time one cody
Kdodooeoijejeikdodkdk🙏🙏1
Radha Rani Krashna ki Jai Ho 🙏🙏
They are better than Sika and dusty
Cody should’ve won tho it gets kinda boring to see Roman win now🫤
1:25 I literally went 'aww' when Liberty hugged her dad.
nobody deserves to be at roman Reignses level only roman can manage this
Always not a good fight! That's why wrestling is such a  boring now to watch...Why is this interference always right there,
Now a days I hate wwe. Old wwe was better than this.
Once again as for 3 years.  Roman as proved he can't beat anybody without cheating. Good match cody
Real winner is cody
6 months later and still The Undisputed WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns ☝️🔥
I miss Roman's old theme.
Roman Reigns always king 👑
Cody Rhodes the American NightMare The Goat
Rematch
Finish the story
That was the right call
Roman reigns 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Roman reigns ❤❤❤❤
Roman reigns ❤️❤️❤️❤️💪💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☝️☝️☝️☝️
Cody left aew to get beat what a dumb move
The like dislike ratio is crazy 1 on 1
Ending sucked😡😡😡
It was cody time man
One's is cheater always is cheater
west vidyo
Co
Roman cheating this match .cody always better ❤
It said universal instead of Undisputed champion plus thanks wwe for making roman win cody did not deserve it
THEY DONT EVEN SHOW HOW MUCH HE WAS CHEATING!!! Still haven’t watched this match and know exactly how it plays because it’s every wrong decision May the pits set ablaze Kingdom or No Deal man
NGL WWE fumbled this match, Cody should’ve won man, he even used the bionic elbow, HIS FATHERS MOVE!
Your likes this Cody Rhodes not Roman Reigns my Cody Rhodes
Cody Rhodes moment father dream dusty Rhodes finesh the story WrestleMania but reason 1000 days not win Roman merchandise ticket selling wwe not wwe is business profit
I cant wait wrestlemania 40  there.. no jey to help but jimmy is debatable
5:24
Malakai black (Aleister black) has beaten Cody Rhodes several times. I think WWE should bring his faction "House of black" back to WWE.
Roman is the best 🫡 and he truly deserves
wait who won?
Wwe is fak e its not fear
Cody is always king man🎉❤
Am a great fan of wwe from png and it's very annoying to seeing the uso's disturbing great matches like this that could have been won by cody.
0:20 WOOOOOOOOOAHHHHHHHH 0:26
Cody was robbed from his moment.
Roman Reigns ☝️
O god😮
Albert Wesker vs Aquaman
They need Cody not Roman.Codys time is now Roman stale now
Roman Wrestlemania sorry he cheats
They screwed Cody from this win Cody needs to dethrone Reigns this time at Mania 40. Nscewing this chance to make it right.
Cody vs Roman 2 Cody wins  at Mania 40.Make ihappen WWE
Roman -The superman 😎❤
I really fearless for roman
7:06
Don't show only Cody rode, show only Roman Reigns fight because Roman Reigns is a trible chief of WWE
So many delicious smark tears to drink here
There is always the man in the green shirt
Wrong call sadly.
The only one the Tribelcheif
Roman Reigns ⚡
Yo hubiera querido Que Triunfará Coddy 😢😢😢
Hii
that scoop slam looked like randy orton 😮
Foook!! Why rom change his character and also Seth !! Why😢😢😢
Why did they cut out the finish
Cody❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
If we comparing Roman to thanos and Cody to a superhero .. if anything he’s captain america this match was his infinity war & hopefully if things go as planned his endgame moment is gonna be at wm40
Another another disappointing WrestleMania
Always Roman win with the help of her brothers 😢 he is noob he Cann deffected by a indian Army
Cody...
The silence of the crowd just explained the whole match to me
This match was good But name it all  Roman always reigns
Kis kis ko lagta shield  ko return karna chaiye  Like karo
Sick match
Roman reings sabse khrab
NOOOOO
Thank you  Kevin
Come on Cody you can do this
Team cody
Čisto sklamanie roman starneš
6:58  I LOVE LEGND AEW CODY ❤
No God wol time wins romin
Cody is gonna win at WM 40 in philly against Reigns
The retain was stupid. The finish was stupid.  Yes Cody got spiked but Reigns took 2 Cross Rhodes but no problem to still stand and spear him. Damn sry i'm just pissed
An underrated part of Roman is that hes great at spelling. Hes so dramatic i love it, and im the biggest cody fan, but i gotta respect rome
I'm come WWE ❤
Bsdk Ka Stardust Ke Character Mai Jada Din Chala To Cody Bna Diya Chutiya Saale Only One Man That Handle Of WWE Charity Roman Reigns Maine Use Jab Pasand Kara Tha Jab Koi Usse Janta Tak Nhi Tha
I mean they’re probably gonna have them win at wrestlemania 40 but I don’t think they should’ve have waiting and I think it was Cody‘s moment. I don’t think they should have wait
Cody : wait for WrestleMania 40
When I heard that three I  literally turn into the hulk lol😂
Frickin  solo had to cost cody the belt
😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂
ROMAN REIGNS ☝️😎
Roman Reigns
Roman Reigns
Roman Reigns
Roman Reigns
Roman Reigns
Cody should have his rematch with roman and should be the one to dethrone roman reigns 🔥 roman cheated, cody should've won this match
One of the Greatest WM Main Event
Love you  roman
Cody ❤ mast he yar
Rematch Cody vs roman r
I'm still waiting for Part 2 of this match. I hope Cody finish the story sooner. do it at WrestleMania 40 Cody.
We really made Cody lose just for Roman to have two tag team matches??? He literally could’ve done that without being champion. This was THE moment and WWE ruined it
John cena treatment you lose the first time but you comeback smarter and better
Chody is more valuable than the title belt. Men with the belt compete to fight with Chody. Roman reigns is not man enough to fight him without his tribe. Always cheating to win.
Cody is going to whoop him next year
Roman Reigns
Román 😡😡😡🤮👊👊👎👎👎👎

Cody is one of the best fighter he could of beaten Roman reigns if he didn't had he's back up
😂😂😂romannn😂😂😂
Cody Rhodes Destroy Roman Riegns Next Time At wrestlemania40
I think undertaker is back and he got is revenge
Omg 😂😂😂😂 entrance ❤❤❤
Cody the great 👍
I hate Roman Reigns
Cody is fabullas
Cody Rhodes 🔥
Roman Best needle mover
You are not champion roman you are always helped 😢😢
WWE really blew this moment. He should be the face of the WWE with how he has matured and developed over his career.
Cody champion match once again
Who else noticed the mistake in the video title
Ppl wanted the man who is carrying WWE on his back for years to be defeated by the one who has betrayed the company before.
Again he can't do it alone 3vs 1 his not chicken salid his chicken chit, check all his tittle defences in the past, every one helps him and that is not a 🏆 champion that's a cheater that there trying to me into a John cena
The only way roman can win is 4on 1 cuz he is not chicken salid he is chicken chit
Roman reigns is trying to build  a  legacy .I like the fact that he not need his families achievement  to be a great wrestler
Too editted match
When I say it's over, it's over 🤫🪦
I'm still going to stick to the facts Cody should have won that damn belt period
Si solo sikoa y los usos no ubieran enterfinido cody hubiera ganado
Roman reigns you cheating every time hate you , you are nothing 👎
Loved the ending☝️
I know Cody’s gonna spin the block and the Bloodline story got even better after this—but if we’re just talking about the title changing hands this was gonna be the best Mania Main event since Bryan at WM30. And the match was everything it should’ve been but the ending was wrong. It’ll be great when it happens but it won’t be like this
6:42 ☝️🩸
TRIPLE H MADE THE RIGHT CALL! 💯
It is Cody's perfect time. The entrance,the crowd, the hyped. But WWE throws it all away.
Romen reigns winer😮
Jhhhggh
Nbvvv
☝🏾
I was there live and remember the rubber chicken hitting a downed Cody with a deflated crowd. Besides that great match.
Its all silen roman win
7:14 LMAO ROMANS OLD THEME STARTED PLAYING (Context: From what I know, his new theme was built off The Truth Reigns, this isn't the first time his old theme has been played before, I think it happened sometime in 2021)
I'm glad I was there to witness it
Roman Reigns cheats
full mach pettu wwe lanjakodaka ni pellam pukula modda
Cody lost
I also watch AJ styles vs Kevin Owens ko but Kevin Owens ko win for United States title
Cody win
Cody may  lose to the tribal cheif Roman reigns I love the match American nightmare vs the tribal cheif
If Cody win I will be shock 😯😯😯😯😯😯😢
I love Cody entrance
WHY?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!JUST WHY!!!!!!!!
Cody be wearing some badazz entrance attire
The cheater roman
Roman reigns ooooooo moment ☝️
im so sure that I'm the only one who wants Roman to retain HAHAHA
roman raings is a feather is wwe
Best booking decision ever.
Another Classic Moment. I love the Pain this caused. This and Brock beating Taker. Amazing Moments in History.       Maat Hotep
I love how Roman won, people need to understand that it’s like undertakers streak, it takes a lot of time and effort to build up the story so when Roman finally loses it will be that shocking moment when the crowd is like whooaaa like wrestlemania 30 when Lesnar beat the streak and that’s what we need we need another moment like that again. Cause it gets boring when we see a new champion every 3 months
Chills
Kon kon mante ha Roman Reigns reandy ke beta ha chiter 😂😂😂
Cody had …and has no business being in the same ring with Roman….
Roman Reigns always 👑 King 👑
There might still be a way for Cody to dethrone Roman at Survivor Series.   1. Cody is still being build as the most beloved babyface  2. Roman is still involved in the "Bloodline Fall" storyline  3. Roman won at WM in order to reach the 1K days as Champion and most likely will also retain his Title at Summerslam in order to reach the 3 year record as Champion  4. Just like Cody predicted the Bloodline is crumbling, the moment Solo & Paul Heyman turn their backs on Roman, Cody will challenge him and eventually win.
Roman is look a like edge
This was the last time Roman defended at 4 months ago. Pathetic lazy part timer
I feel like they are going to meet again at WM 40 and its going to be even better !!  This was a missed opportunity until that happens  Lets go Cody
Cody deserves a belt man
From Shield, Seth, Triple H, Authority, Lesnar, Sheamus, Wrestlemanias, Undertaker, Leukemia, Face, to Heel.  I've seen all of Roman from his very debut as SHIELD, and stopped watching WWE right when his Bloodline Saga began.   I'm glad to see how things went.
I just watched Daniel Bryan’s win from Wrestlemania. Holy s**t why didn’t they go for it, everything led up to it. Now Jey is the best person to win the title from Roman, but when will Cody have something like this again?
I acknowledge u my tribal chief
The whole heart warming come back 😂 His family being there at ringside 😂 Even Steve Austin said “Cody winning the championship is not gonna put him over”
Cody 🔥🔥🔥
cheater
The moment when they showed Negative One's face on WWE Television
That's all lies, just movie shaw to get money......
Great job cody u are great roman is loser
wwe is the screpted match..
Im just saying, Cody shouldve won
Paul heyman is like immortal or something, he still looks the same after a decade xD
Cody’s family participation was just enough for him over Roman’s Bloodline
Finish the story with unified titles
This is a Best Wrestlemania MainEvent of all time 🔥 Incredible Performance 🤯🤯 Energetic Crowd 🔥🔥
They had Cody's kids and wife there like wwe is messed up for that
What I love about Cody is that he proved himself in the presence of his father and brother Goldust, and I wouldn't exaggerate if I said that this man surpassed his father's popularity, although his body is modest for non-wrestlers, but he made his way outside and inside the company despite all the difficulties
roman rings do cheating but cody is more power full do re match
Without cheating roman reign couldn't win, I love cody rodes
5:23 uuuuuuuuuuaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh
VAI VIDIEO SUNDAR HOYACHA
snore the ufa wins again snore lose the title already snore 😴
Honestly i cried
Worst ending ever
That look on Cody's face was soooooooo emotional.
What reigns said on the camera when he beat cody? At 7:16
Roman Reigns is the worst wrestler in wwe
Chettinv not  re. Mach plees
Supper shot❤
Knowledge you roman
Champ is hear in Cody rhods
Cody is back secend cena❤❤❤❤
Wtf roman cheated here

roman reigns bai bangladesha cai
The front
Goodmayes
❤❤❤
We need Seth Vs roman
Mann😕😕 l have really get frustrated from this boring reigns run this was the best time to finish it.but wwe is weeding man
5:46 so much false hope.
As long as Roman have his family there he will always win and Cody actually won that match over all
I was there !
I can see someone making stardust reference to piss him off sometime in the future
Why does Cody Rhodes reminds me of Homelander? 😂
Roman always bro
Roman❤️❤️❤️❤️
Only one spear and game is finish love you tribel chief
Whhoooooooooaaaaaaaa!!!!
Roman is big chitar wreslar
Roman cheated 😹
All wwe matches are fixed 😡😡👎👎 Ending was👎👎👎 WWE fake
First ever worst decision ending undertaker streak  Second worst decision cody lost
Roman he is best'❤❤❤❤
Roman is like Novak djokovic . He is mentally stronger than anyone
TBH after Ko hits Roman with Stunner and Samy woth Helluva Kick Roman still winning isnt a justified ending , at that moment i thought cody would win
Cody was hero this match
Correct
Roman Reigns love from India for Roman Reigns 🔥🔥😎💪🏻
i miss old roman!
La hija de Cody Rhoades tiene un tío luchador campeón intercontinental, un padre que será leyenda y nieta de un icono... El legado Rhoades... 🙌🏼
Boo yourselves and stop booing roman
Y'all really need to stop booing my favorite wrestler roman Y'all are so annoying and disgusting Y'all need to be booing  you'reselfs
5:25 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Cody should have won
sitting roman
Why is Roman Reigns so out of shape Dude Looks flabby as hell
Cody is a great wwe superstar but in at the end of the day Romans reigns wins😂.
best motivation
I literally said Only one man can defeat roman reigns, his name is SETH ROLLINS ❤❤❤❤
😂now the hype is not gonna be the same wwe made a big mistake
He should be new champion
You thr man Coy. Roman's days are numbered!!@😊
Love Cody ❤❤❤
Roman is cheater, won the match because of "solo sikoa" otherwise we would lose that day i guaranteed 💯 and those fans who acknowledge the Roman were those the real idiot 🤣
Cody is nothing means smaller to reigns
⚔️⚔️⚔️⚔️⚔️🔥🔥🔥💪💪👑👑😎🖕rrrrrrrr100;0
Bruh let's just admit it roman reings is the goat
Cody put up a good match
I love Cody roucse my favorite wrestler 💕💕💕💕💗💗💗💗💗😘😘😘😘😘😘💋💋💋❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😗😗😗😚😚😚😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Cody rhodes should be 8 time wwe champion
WWE CAN WE GET A REMATCH AT THE NEXT EVENT THIS STIPULATION SOLO KO AND SAMO ZAYN ARE BARRED FROM RINGSIDE
The Greatest Ever
Roman🔥
Whatever it is, I am a fan, but a fan of Roman Reigns 😏🥃
all Paul heyman will do is pay for Roman to win he didn’t win Cody won Roman all you are is a cheat and liar 🤥 Roman Reigns is Pinochle
Hii from India
cody reminds me of old edge now
This Roman hype is very exaggerated, how do you take 2 finishers from Owens and Zayn, catch more and not lose? Impossible and as we saw Roman's dog only wins with help
Madarchhod hai roman lw😅 or chitar hai oo or Jo uska fen hai oo bhi 😅😊
We are tired of this silly Vince's boy
If Solo didn’t interrupted, this match would’ve easily won match of the year.
الإمبراطور رومان
So how did he win? They cut it from the video
Roman is really king of head of the table
The like and dislike ratio even says it all *Your script in this match sucked at it's best WWE*
Romen is he is a chiter hi win toh chitting 😡😡😡😡
Cody Rhodes deserve it  because cody is best player 💪💪
Roman
Wow Jimmy and Jay like kiss up to Romans
I was at the raw before wrestlemania and everyone I was sitting with was 50/50 about Cody winning. He just got a win over Brock Lesnar, let him feud with the roster before he gets to Roman again. That win will be 10x better with the entire universe behind him. He’s definitely going to be the next face.
Cody rhodes is only wrestler who has potential to defeat the roman reigns
Roman is a big cheater 😡😡😡😡👺
I will not recognize or acknowledge ROMAN REIGNS as any champion until he actually wins the World Heavyweight Championship
Coady u are the next big thing ❤
6:56 reminds me of WrestleMania 28 John Cena lost to the rock, Cody's disappointed expression is very similar to Cena，I feel that cody is going the way of cena in 2012, cody may beat roman at next year's wrestlemania 40, just like cena won the rematch with the rock at wrestlemania 29
How many kids did Dusty Rhodes have besides Cody and Dustin? Roman Reigns is so stinkin' sexy that it makes my heart melt.
We want this match full
Someone go and tell cody he is not everlasting focus not in brock lesnar focus on Jesus for everlasting life . WHAT JESUS TOLD IF ANYONE PUT sword will later die by sword
كودي اشتغل رومان شغل 😂
Aquaman Vs Homelander
Dusty Rhodes has always been my favorite wrestler, he was my hero as a kid, I watched WWF and I was a hulkamaniac and all that but the WWF was a cartoon compared to the NWA, Dusty's Mic work and in ring ability for a guy his size was second to none and what Cody is doing right now is awesome and Dustin is the only guy that could have pulled off the Gold Dust gimmick and made it work and got it over huge. Those boys have made their father proud and it's awesome to see
😂
our new favorite cody
The finish, you can see Vince is back. Dammit.
Its obvious that cody is winning it in summerslam or next wm....its once in a decade opportunity to crown someone for 1000 days so they wont lose it.....
They ruined this moment. Cody should have taken this belt.
ROMAN REIGNS BE LIKE: THANK YOU FOR THE MOTIVATION PAUL😂👀
Our TRIBLE CHEIF is bestttt👑💯
Coward bloodline😂
Worst hilight ever... period
Graves did a great job at the end. “Don’t stop Cody! Finish the story!” Made the moment as sad as the finish was.
WWE Botched this one so much
roman always cheet
Worst booking ever in WrestleMania history
Roman Reigns is wast player in wwe
Pathetic Finish
I cant never forget megastar roman reigns ☝️ only one
pucha active los dislikes y su cantidad de dislikes XD
I still think WWE messed this up lol. Cody is for sure the people’s champ and this was their chance to give it to him. Reminds me of when Austin beat The Rock at X7 but without the end result being the same.
Cody entrance is my favourite
This match still breaks my heart today😔💔
I like cody
I love Cody so much
Yall suck for cheering on roman man
And that's why roman is still victorious with his fights against the belt he has his allies who defend funny when It happened The fight between brothers Usos Vs Owns is Zayn where is he to help them win the belts in When is he they try Help
king roman🔥🔥🔥
Sometimes 2 is to many to fight
Tribal Chief🥰☝
I challenge you Roman Reigns
I can see you Roman Reigns
If Cody Rhodes is Korean, wwe got punished
Cody rhoades needs to be wwe champion The WrestleMenia Convention is full of corruption Cody Rhodes is a player with a lot of spirit of sacrifice
Roman Always cheating 👎👎
roman always cheats to win so that should be cody titles
This Man gay nothoing but hmm i thinking nothoing!
Its do obwious they do it for f,, comercial
F... you Roman regins i beat you
They where both beaten,so all those saying he didnt win for himself shame on u
King is King and he is Roman reigns
ROMAN 😍😍
Booooo!!!!!!
I’m praying they do a rematch next year no solo no Paul just one on one Cody vs Roman but the only thing I’m worried is how wwe will do cody redemption/journey and who knows fans could lose the hype on cody Rhodes but who knows man i just hope they do a rematch
Gotta admit cody gave roman a challenge, but roman isnt easy to beat especially with the interference of his cousins
I will always support roman reigns forever 💙 ❤ ♥
Roman reigns  won this match but cheated ...... Unfair match... Deserving person is " Cody rodes
6:30 back ground Music name PLZ???
Enserio Cody como cara de la empresa nahhh sería muy zzzzz
Now I love cody not roman reign
This was such a letdown. The storyline was ruined. Even if Cody gets the belt later, this was the time. The ending here made no sense after the buildup. Now there is some dumb feud with Brock Lesnar to try n gloss over the fact that creative ruined a great show. Just listen to the crowd.
I’m still so sick of Roman since the very first push. Just stop with Roman and Brock. I thought maybe Cody would get the raw heavyweight title since he lost this. But nope, way to blow a moment wwe. You knew we wanted Cody to win. And no one would have minded you knowing and giving it to us
রোমান কে জাড়া জুতা দিয়ে পিটিয়ে wwe তেকে বের করা দরকার
Once upon a time when roman speaks in mic he get full of boo's..... Now when he got the mic on his hand the crowd goes 🔥
Roman Reigns 🎉
Roman reigns held universal championship since i was 13 year old now 16year old and all now that he will probably hold that till next year when im 17😢
❤
Yay wx
Cody Rhode is trash of course the tribal chief is going to win
Roman reings in help solo sikoa . Cody Rhodes is a King.Roman loser Loser Loser
Roman reings is a Loser
Best matche i have watched in my life the entrances the emotions everything was perfect i am not mad at the results this was the biggest WrestleMania match of modern era
Cody is overrated af i don't understand his popularity
Cheat n win again.
They Just Added a little bit of his old theme right theree 7:13
When a hated hero becomes a loved villain
I'm pretty sure a lot of you will disagree but I think Jey should be the one to dethrone Roman. The whole Bloodline started with him and it needs to end with him.
Cody should have won😢
That was heartbreak at the end 😢
Roman reigns is not a man coming always with his family
I am the future wrestler of wwe since 2029.25
I literally jumped in happiness when Roman won what a shocker to all chipmunks 😂
More like “American Psycho” in the flesh. Patrick Bateman would be proud! 😂
Cody is best than roman range the romang range cheater party
They day i got to know it is scripted my heart broked nothing excites me more in wwe
bravo cody vous etiez un Grand Heros contre ce taureau baguareure vous l avez donner une grande lecon il n est pas sportif du tout il a gagne presque tous ces matchs par les triches surtout avec son equipe du tripple
É fácil ganhar trapaceando,por isso dão tantos main events pro Reigns!!!!
Who is gonna beat this man?
Hi i forget to Stay you are a drugs Addicted
Cody is a goddamm legend
Cody Rhodes be lookin like Commissar Rhodes
Roman chiting kore khale re vai tora ki kore oke like koris ka jane
Damn losers try to dig out something about Roman Reigns way back in the 16th century... 🤣
its enought of roman being the champion.....its no more fun seeing him win every single match now, change the champ now........
Roman rang camon❤❤
Roman is such a scared little kid,always moving with his cousins,Cody will beat him anyday,anytime.
to me, 6:55 was a clear indication that this story is in fact not finished
Roman should win but not that way
Wwe missed the chance , the moment was perfect when Sami And KO intervened in the match. Cody should've hit the Cross Rhodes and won. Imagine perfect revenge for KO and Sami both as Reigns and Bloodline made their life hell.
Cody u r next king wwe👑👑👑👑
I think Roman lost title after 1000 days complete
lots of respect to both wrestler. Match was great but unfair ❤
Romene is king
Its gotta be a top 5 pop all time and I don’t even like Cody
Roman rengs❤❤
Did you guys know Cody was supposed to win but they went off script
Fue un robo 😢
Roman not win 2022 to 2023 all matches helping brothers
Roman Reigns is the best wrestler in wwe universe and it looks satisfying when he holds that universal champion belt  and raise up in the air...No one can compare with the Roman physical its simply outstanding ... go ahead mr tribal chief never give up 👊🏻
We need old Roman 😢
Roman reingn cheater 👎👎👎
Thanks for this video wwe ji
All I Watched That Complete 100% Fakeness Nothing Looks Real
I like you Roman rings My from nepal
he can't do anything on his own "Tribal Cheat"
Cant wait For Roman to beat Jesus soon with a 2.99 sec kickout and rollup pin
codyvsromanreigns
This is satanism. Rome controls this world in Vatican. And it is played here in your faces. You will learn the secret or die ignorant.
From ppv Payback 2020 until Wrestlemania 2023 Tribal Chief beat all the superstar. 🔥🔥🔥
Roman Reigns wins Wwe Title :  2x Universal Champion 4x Wwe Champion
Cody was the real winner here, without a doubt. :DDD
Roman Reigns improper wins is the reason I stopped watching wrestling for a some times now. He doesn't win clean, bulshit!
You just need a hoodie to hide your identity💀
We need Stone Cold to save us.
Roman 👎👎👎👎
Romans Reign all the way
Now it feels like there’s going to be a civil war with all the factions
Roman is inevitable....this character feels like Thanos.☝🏻
Roman reings the Best
Roman Reigns no 1 u know.. 😍😍😍
This is the worst script i have ever seen in my life
Lets be honest, Rhodes was as "over" as he's ever gonna get. This was a stupid ending if you're still planning on ever giving it to him. If not, talk about petty 😂
Roman Reigns always laddy 😂✌️ then our jimy brothers also transgender 🥸🤡
WWE love making awful decisions at wrestlemania
roman reigns is father of all fighters
roman reigns is best
Wrestler can block Roman Reigns spear. Lift your both hand and thighs. Being Held both hand, Wrestler should lying down. Having put his feet into Roman belly, Wrestler should throw Roman Reigns behind his head.
Poor cody. This hurts to watch my boy lose that
I love every storyline in which Roman is winning . Reings is just ❤❤❤
I dont know why but as long as roman is retaining these titles the story line is lit for me ❤❤
Stardust is very powerfull now
Roman reigns loser😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬🤬😡
Roman reigns is best
I don't like roman new fight style a hit to sloppy but I still love I like heel turn that rocks
Hamen ruins it
If I use them they would not appear every time Roman loses the title, I would have lost it a long time ago someday a fighter will be smart and before fighting roman for the title he will first make sure that the uso cannot interfere either by hell in a cell or by first taking care of the uso before the fight in the locker room with the help of other fighters
Cody Rhodes was gonna win this Broo
Roman when being the face of the company everybody wanted him to lose and he won and now Roman is a heel and now still he wins he is the pet of WWE
The biggest cheater🤣 I have ever seen in my life is Roman . Has he won any match without helping
it seems like reigns is coming to an end
Tha use ❤ Roman bhai❤❤
Roman had a voice crack
Walmart homelander
Roman Reigns is the power house
Roman India 🥰
Roman is strong
Let's just summarize what just happened. - The Bloodline was torn apart, giving Zayn the perfect opportunity to take the title. - This didn't happen, meaning a follow up match of greater proportions was needed. - A partial retribution line was also being eluded to for Jay Uso. - And in the span of a single match, the WWE blew literally all the tension by having Reigns retain the title in Rhodes's greater follow-up match in which Zayn and K.O. interluded to get revenge, also ruining the redemption arc for Jay in the process...  Smooth, real smooth...
Iam from India Roman rengies ♠️♠️
Roman reigns is a boring champ, I'm sick to watch wwe now
Immortal song😂
Never seen a supertar lift the tittles. For roman ahh its just part of the show for fans the weight those belts carry, the reposibility, contracts lawsuits money etccc not everyone can carry them its hard to find someone who can reolace roman right now
It's Bogus, right! Because cody had him in the late time of the match, but that maniac solo he Lost it
Seriously who thought Cody Rhodes was going to win Even without the bloodline it is very hard for Cody Rhodes to beat roman reigns
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
5 Vs 1 ollway respect cody💗or  roman losses man
you are wrestlemania tribal chief
Hola
Stupid Result.......Man I Tired Of Seeing Him Everywhere Since 2015......Please Create And Push Other Talents Who Has Talents Ring Skills & Good Background Struggle Story......Likes Of Drew McIntyre,,Seth Rollins,,Aj Styles,,,Brock Lesnar......Etc ...... WrestleMania 39 Was The Perfect Time To Create Cody As New Champion But WWE So Obsessed With One Family Ruined Everything......If You Can't Pull The Trigger At The Right Time It Destroyed The Hype....Maybe Cody Will Take These Titles In Near Future But Will He Got Same Atmosphere Like WrestleMania.......I Watched WWE since i Was A Kid & one thing i always hate about it that they push their choosen guys like they are undefeated & Buried the Hardwoking Talents Who Has Better Ring Skills Than Their Choosen Ones.....They Treat Other Hardworkers Like A Jobbers just because they are not related to any Family.....Stop The Nepotism....Things Needs To Change....Gives The Guys Chance Who Has Better Than Some Overrated Families Members...... Respect The Talents Background Struggle..... It's Easy To Get A Chance In Company If Your Family Already Belongs To It....But What About Other Kids And Talents Who Has Talents And Saw A Dream That One Day They Will Headline WrestleMania.....Again Stop The Nepotism.......
Where is the full match of cody vs roman
Roman Reigns AGAIN😈😈😈
Look jon sina face
Vince dumb
Are you kidding me if only the stupid usos was not there cody would win that match
Lawda highlight
Man of the Cody
Jai shree ram
Dont worry  One day This Unholy Reign will end  no matter what I just wish that may KO and Zayn take SOLO SIKOA out for a really long time
Cool
There could have been no chanting at the end but you can see the ones finger raised by lots of people.  Acknowledge him
4:44
4:39
Why they  are waiting their opponents to hit thm...
The Anoai family,,is the greatest family in WWE history luk,rock,Roman,jimmy,jey,solo,Umaga e.t.c they belong to this company
Pov: This is the most disliked video from WWE
Cody's story is one the greatest in the history of the pro wrestling.. With that said, most are wining that he should have won..Guys like Seth Rollins, Drew Mcyntyre, Kevin Owens, Finn Balor, Shinsuke, Ziggler, Shemous, Lashley, we can go back in time, The GOAT Flair, Owen Hart, Eddie Guerrero, even CM motherbleeping Punk,, all these guys and more have held it down for us for years and have never got what Cody just got, to be in the main event of mania... Many would trade the world titles they won for a chance to main event mania..
Should've been Drew vs Roman anyway
☝🏾
Who agrees that Cody Rhodes vs Roman Reigns at SummerSlam for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship! The Rematch!
Worst edit
Roman rang is cheating this match winer cody
did anybody hear roman's old music just a little bit after Heyman says, You are Wrestlemania or is that part of his song?
If that Solo hadn’t intervened………..
7:13 Roman's old theme??
Rejuvenating the 1st prequel spin-off of the 1976's Best Picture of Rocky, featuring Creed vs. Rocky in sports.
ESPY nominates WWE Best Moment of the Year for Roman Reigns vs Cody Rhodes aka WrestleMania 39: Night 2 - Reigns vs. Rhodes.
I feel like WWE don't know what to do at this point or don't want to take risks. They should've pumped the Bloodline with belts. Let Roman hold both titles, let Jimmy&Jey hold both tag team titles, give Solo the intercontinental title, make them either interfere in contenders matches or just smash every title match they are in, but have them wrestle week in week out, except for Roman who just comes for show and brawls putside of major events. And the grand finale, at Wrestlemania 40, prep a match between The Rock and Roman, bring all the Samoans back for the main event, all the bloodline's relatives, and make it like a "wake up to reality match" where the big bro Rock comes to slap some sense into Roman in a 30 min match full of moves because they both got the arsenal and they compliment each other. Have the Usos turn their back on Roman, have the Usos make Solo realize that following orders like a dog isn't a thing. Also, bring back Dean Ambrose, form the shield again, make them come back too and implement them into the storyline. After wrestlemania and after the BLOODLINE lost every title, turn Roman babyface again, keeping the faction but naming it The Table or smth like that, where you have the shield, Usos and Sikoa. Roman can keep his head of the table atitudine where he is the baddest, but use that to keep control in future internal conflicts within the Table and have him Smash heels that provoke major injuries or play too dirty towards any member of the faction. This is how you can keep things interesting for some years in the WWE and also make Roman, finally the top guy in the company whilish he is a baby face because let's be honest, no one will acknowledge Roman as an all time best untill he can succed both at being a Babyface and a heel.
I hate Roman
If Roman is so afraid of losing the match, then he should not have come to the ring.  He lost his respect by repeatedly winning by cheating.
Roman Reigns always win match with cheating
East and West Roman reign is the best
It was so awesome to be there! The energy is something else, the "Whoa" from everyone was amazing!
Para mí, El Undertaker y Triple H son los más grandes en la historia de la WWE, pero Roman Reings va camino a superarlos
Don't interfere, only two in the ring, Cody will win for sure
👆🏻👆🏻😎😎
The way everyone stopped shouting once he took the headphones off his daughters ears…. Nothing but respect ❤
I love Brock Lesnar and Roman reigns 😊
I miss u old roman

Bsdk kaat kyu rha hai vedio
I love the fact Cody’s move set is just made up of all the members of evolution.. my guys got Rick flairs figure fours, he’s hit the pedigree on Seth rollins, the Cody cutter is basically just an RKO off the ropes.
Mc what it was?????????????
Roman won the match but Cody won the heart's ❤

It’s fun seeing Cody use both his brother and Ortons moves
Cody's theme is garbage.
Night mare
The WWE had the opportunity to generate the Feel Good Moment of the Century... and Completely Dropped the Ball.  The atmosphere was electric, the fans were completely behind Rhodes... but thanks to the usual Lazy Writing, Terrible booking, Roman Cheats as usual... and wins again. Cody deserved better, but I believe the loyal Fans of the WWE deserved better. They wanted so badly for Cody to "Finish his Story" Even if cody wins it in the next pay per view, it will not be the same... It Will NOT be a Wrestlemainia Moment. So Disappointed.
Why is it that he also fite with his dogs
Man I wanted Cody to win that match so much!
Roman is fake wresler
Cody needs to develop a new finisher, one that would make the crowd go wild and is explosive.
Inini from Zimbabwe ndakuti Roman reigns chinyara🤣
Am a huge Roman Reigns' fan but I acknowledge Cody's entrance theme,moreso the "wowowowowowo" part
Good  job
I want Both of the titles at the hand on brock Lesnar 🔥
Cody Rhodes is a real hero...💖
Cody should have won.
😂😂😂
Too bad the leukemia didn't come back
7:13  Did anyone notice Roman's old theme in background??
WWE: "I don't understand why we have trouble making new stars"  Also WWE when there a new Star at their hand: **Make them lose at their hottest moment *
I'd like to see Cena become 17x world champion that would be epic
When cody was already winning due to count out but it is not in the script he has to go out of the ring 🤣🤣🤣
Roman the best of the best ❤
Cody Rhodes or Golddust?
How r u cody
Can't give Cody everything the moment he returns I think it was the right decision to keep Roman champion and drew Mcintyre or Seth Rollins should be the ones to dethrone him
That's me or we can hear "big dog" entrance at the end for a second ?
It feels like HHHs reign of terror again from 2002 to 2005. But the difference is Reigns hasn’t lost the belts and won them back he has continued to be the world champion 2020 to present just a matter of when at this point who will be the first to defeat him.

RIP old Roman Big dogy
Roman beimaan hai sala
one of the best
Missing old wwe
Y’all just mad Roman won at this point plus he wouldn’t of won because Roman wouldn’t give it to a person that just been there for months
The WWE is loosing fans and ruining themselves by letting Reigns keep the title as long as he has.
Sigo a Roman Reigns desde la época del Escudo. Su sencillez y profesionalismo llegó donde está ahora.
Roman won doesn't matter the circumstances... everyone can whine but a loss is a loss.. reigns is a heel and he's doing a good job being one the bloodline was over before Sami got involved they really didn't need him...he showed his true colors.. it's a joke him and Kevin are tag champion's
Wow love you
Tell me one reason why y'all think Cody deserve to take the belts from Roman reigns think it should be Seth Rollins or dean ambrose solo or jey USO the rock
The right person won! 💯
I can't understand why wwe is over promoting reigns. Seth Rollins is the most deserving guy now
Roman reigns he should won
TEAM ROMAN
😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Winner iS Cody ❤ Cody you are win of millions fans heart ❤️💜
Wwe King Roman reings
Fake ahh fights
Shield Come Back 🙏🙏
Cody  good
The one and only king  👑 👑 👑 roman.👑👑👑
Roman Reigns mic skills looks so forced...
Can we just take a moment to recognize how good of a seller Reigns is? Look at that stunner/Heluva Kick combo they did.
cody rhodes is next world champion very soon.
Cody = Underrated
Yes
destroying interest on wwe to see Roman Reign's betrayal. What the American children is learning fm betrayal for a long time by a same person??
Triple h suck
It’s crazy how long it’s been since these guys last fought
If u don't mind the truth... We know Cody Rhodes can beat Roman Reigns. Roman has all the cheating family backbone support. Roman Reigns knows he can be beaten by Cody Rides but he has his family to show family backstabbing ratings. WWE is simplified not to understand, why not have Roman and Cody in a cage match without a Referee? In the cage match, locked and the cage covered to the top with fencing, no one can climb out and escape, MMA style of fight. Take that to the bank, WWE roll play. Oops, forgot MMA is real fighting, not roll play, ballerina acrobatic WWE dancing. textiles.
Father dusty Rhodes Sister lhana Rhodes  Man Cody Rhodes
Who is this cody. He doesn't even deserve a title match .
💩💩💩💩💩💩
DAMN I GOT LOW BALLED BACK IN 2019 THEN. THEY ONLY GAVE ME 50 PERCENT FOR THE 70 PERCENT BOX

My grandfather said when I was younger... "Hard times breed better man"  I know it's father, but in my case, it was my grandfather who told me the same lines when I was a kid. This one's for you grandpa! ❤
NOOOOOOOOO Roman
Vuelve a decepciónar wwe y más aún Román reins
Parabens Rody ganhe mais forças  Não te esquece que esta lutar com duas pessoas( Roman , solo v  Rodes
RIP Cody 💀 😞🙏
Señores muchas personas vemos este programa no deben permitir aceptar cuando dice ser ganador por tramposo eso es el sr. Román
Tramposo Román el ganador es Rody ❤
Hear me out I’m islander. But I needed Rhodes to win man
So. Mal eine Frage. Was hat der Rest der Bloodline dort zu suchen? Kann Roman Reigns nicht alleine kämpfen?
Man!Cody this is the time for a rodes era
Roman👎👎👎👎👎👎
NOW DAYS WWE IS SUCK🤬🖕🏾😤😡🤬
Finally i would stopped watching WWE all Together 😔😂😭🤬
What a waste of great opportunity for cody. WWE script is now a days is written in bars& pubs Great build up and royal entrance with family, only to see roman reigns defending his title Seriously WWE. You wasted the game
Codi is best wrestler
Roman fan
that was the worst WrestleMania I've ever seen.. after 15 years watching wwe in my life im so done & that's it the storyline has been so week & boring
Of course Román Reigns has always been able to win thanks to the help of the Members of the Lineage and he has already been defeated and they always intervene and so he has been able to retain the title. I think that Roman Reigns should fight against Cody Rhodes but in a fight where he does not intervene and has no help from anyone and if someone intervenes automatically Roman loses If you start to analyze all those triumphs, Román Reings owes them to the members of the Lineage because he alone is not capable of beating anyone. He must always have the help of his Lineage.
Roman cant lose the titles yet
Iknew cody had to lose
The title says universal title instead of undisputed wonder if that was on purpose
Cody will win the WWE Title when it gets split after the Draft
Damn as long as Roman got his family he always going to win
Most poor story line of all time
952 days and counting! Acknowledge your Tribal Chief!! ☝🏻
Roman Reigns 💯💯
Been saying it for weeks that Roman would retain.   Roman > Cena Roman > Hulk  Acknowledge him.
From Egypt we support Kodi Rhodes and Roman wins the help of others
رومان رينز غشاش و ضعيف و لولا المساعدة مكنش هيقدر يفوز . من  مصر ندعم كودى

Romania very bad

Bloodline is the king of all time
Roman without em uso's brothers he ain't will never won any single match 🥶😭
Rhodes just returned,! It wasn't time . Just as the angle is playing out! He didn't earn the opportunity . It was given to him! That's why Lesnar was turned!
Cody Rodes u are Rockxtàr💯🤩
WWE is officially dead
West and loss player cody only Brock lesanrr fireee
In india Roman Reigns fan following is huge ❤️❤️❤️
Roman sucks, WWE will ride this dead horse all the way to bordom
What a unpleasent script this tidal deserve to cody not a over acted roman
Ok this was a shocker....BIG TIME...and that is a good thing in wrestling...normally...the bloodline is by far the biggest thing in wrestling right now along with Sami Zayn...and Cody Rhodes...all the progress WWE made...I stopped watching them in 2019....they had won me back recently...especially when they finally did war games at survivor series...but this finish...after all this build...shows the chaos WWE is in again...it's clear Vince is back...it's clear triple h isn't in complete control....this was a wonderful story with an excellent WrestleMania match...and a horrible finish...just when wwe began win me back I realize I'm so thankful I am still an AEW fan....I myself always preferred Cody in aew over cm punk...but it's not what we got...
Roman reigns awesome best good going great
The whole Roman reigns cheating in almost every match is getting really old😮‍💨, the "cousins" always step in and winning it for him🙄 it's just boring now, come on wwe shake it up a bit for the sake of the universe 🙏🖤🌹
Cody would be a great champ.. And that could have been a wrestlemania moment for the ages....a clean victory would have made the crowd go absolutely nuts.... A shame
Stop the freaking bloodline. They seriously suck
This is just nonsense and it has to stop it is boring now always end with a cheat. This is just pure nonsense
Wwe no sirve
There is no honor for Roman Reigns
Roman Reigns is like drinking a glass of warm water. Its like, I guess this is as cool as Stone Cold? Not really. But it will hold you over if you're dehydrated.
Lmao 80k dislikes
Boreman reigns     Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Cody Rhodes should have won not Roman Reigns, but then there you see what the help of The Bloodline does to Roman and he does not deserve it all what so ever
Cody reminds me of Homelander for some reason.
My super star never dissappoint love u roman reign
I wanted Roman to win but I thought Cody would win this match made me feel crazy even my dad shook my legs😂❤💪🏻🤼‍♂️
Or maybe I like both
Actually, your travel chief, one again❤😂❤😂❤
Roman reigns, is the best
I wish Cody had one😢😢
roman reigns gettin push worst then john cena no cap

Cody Great Performance 💪 🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️ Against Roman reigns and Better than John CENA summer slam 2021
So you want this tribal bit*h to hold the titles   no problem    his unworthy character wont change by it
God Samantha irvin butchered the announcing on this match... How to you take the American nightmare and make it sound..... Phony and boring ad hell... She sucks man...for a match of such massive caliber they should of had mike Rome announce it.. He has the perfect voice for introducing two of the biggest superstars...
Boycott Wwe  Murkh banate hai chodu✅🤣
I only hope for brock lesnar that he will lose, brock lesnar will bring back the former beast
Roman reigns 🔥
HHH didn't want Cody to win because he would've gotten the same reaction Daniel Bryan and Kofi Kingston got when they each won their title match. HHH wants Cody's moment to be way bigger than theirs. Right now, the timing is wrong from a financial standpoint. This rivalry has dollars written all over it. And now that Brock is involved, it should be more interesting.
7:15 -Who else heard big dog Roman's old theme song when camera was on cody rhodes??🤔
Roman always all match Chetting 😂😂😂not good roman😏😏
i can't understand what happened. why wwe itself kicks out good opportunity for next generation.. is it a vince's work?.. fxxk

So proud of ROMAN❤🥰🫶🏾
Cody won the ref was very clearly bribed .
Reign on me.💧
im tired or roman being the best BRING BACK AN OG AND DESTROY HIM
Dude they dropped the ball big time, when will they getter a bigger buildup to WM l, with a more deserving guy.  HOW did WWE screw this up!ml?
Wost champion of all time
Most over rated wrestler ever
Must suck knowing 3 months before the match that you won't win, training and practicing for a loss... I guess the pay makes up for it LOL
They did Cody Nasty 😢😢
Cody would have won the title if Solo Sikoa didn't intrefere with the match. He was banned from ringside so Roman reigns won the match by default and by intrefereance
Roman win match , Cody win heart ❤
I just don't get the outcome of this match.  I like Cody Rhodes but it is more of a Roman Reigns thing. Roman Reigns is fine, but I have watched wrestling since the 80s and there are far more charismatic wrestlers that have not received as much love as RR has by the WWE.  Trying to convince me he is one of the greatest wrestlers/entertainers of all time in the WWE isn't working.  Again I don't dislike RR but to have the title belts in his possession for this long is getting boring.  I find the whole Bloodline storyline stale.  They must be selling to many Bloodline shirts to break them up.  For the first time in the 40 years or so I've watched WWE I was actually annoyed by the outcome.  The following night with the whole Brock and Cody thing only made me more annoyed.
Greatest cheater of all time
Booooooooring!!!! Wins with a spear wow so impressive how groundbreaking
Roman reigns the king of wwe
I LOVE YOU CODY
No, Roman Reigns is the only one who can rule like this...the tribal chief☝🏻🤙🏻♥️
Cody had his chance  and it is over  because roman is king of the wwe
Not my time - Rhodes 😔
Roman just closed the book now it's over
Another phase of the 3rd year in regime of supreme power Reigns
Roman's not dethroned that's impossible But Cody the American nightmaaaaaaaaaaaareeeee ended Roman's bloodline no more Usos 🎉
100000000+ times still No moment, no journey , no battle can overcome Roman Reigns 😮
Roman tu coward he 🤬🤬
Roman reigns doesnt deserve tp be acknowledged ugh I really wish Cody won
Last time i watched WWE was in 2017 i think. People always hated how they pushed Roman Reigns to the max and forced him to be liked. I was convinced they understood to stop this. As i saw this video i knew i made the right decision to quit WWE….   And wtf happened to Zayn hahah
Roman......you can never win matches on your own?
Cody deserve the title. The greatest match seen after long time. Roman reigns are not able to defend cody❤❤
Cody beat Roman to me I don't care what y'all say
They did my boy Cody dirty. Damn, I genuinely thought he was going to win. That's the only reason I watched that match.
I dont care what everyone says but I love my roman Reigns from the day I saw him in WWE ❤❤❤🎉
Cody is 0% fit for that title, he looks like Jamie noble of 2023 🤣
The suit is corny😊
All time cheaters roman and roman chhakka team
Beiman roman
boring match with a known outcome roman reigns will not lose the title for the next few years why? simple he is supposed to break the record of bob backlund who had the title for 6 years so totally useless to watch his matches why does the wwe have any titles at all? they are hardly ever defended the title holders are not around for months basically the wwe is a league WITHOUT TITLES this is so ridiculous same problem with charlotte flair she shows up after months and gets the title as a gift now she has lost it so she can show up in a few months and get the title as a gift again and why is that?? because she is daddy girl and daddy had 16 titles so she has to have at least 16 titles   by now you can predict who is going to win and who is going to lose someone calls blodline or jugmand day or another one out and loses the last few months it's always been the same i kept defending wwe when it said boring but now?? it's getting boring even for me what's wrong with you??   you bring back people like brown strowman and do nothing with them? let him bum around midcard and get beaten by everyone? especially stupid to put him in the tagteam which makes zero sense  finally do something sensible again brings excitement and above all BRINGS THE TITLES BACK TO WWE and let them defend and change and stop with the boring years of the same title holders that are never there
This was an awesome match regardless of the outcome!
It was cody's moment......  To lose ☝☝☝
Man the song, the crowd pop, the Father promos all last year, how in the hell did WWE fumble the ball this bad...I know Rhodes isn’t done but the story was perfect to make him the champ
someone must stop roman...still cheating n cheating..not real man..
I'd put this up there with any of the classic mania matches. Granted, it hasn't had the test of time yet but I honestly cannot remember the last time I was so invested in a wrestling match.
Sami suck

2023 Year Of The Superstar Cody Rhodes 🔥🇺🇸
Cody should have won those unisputed titles.
Roman deserves to win this 🎉 🙏🏼
Samoa to the king roman
This was a really good match.
I was already skeptical about this match as we all know how his sidekicks interferes in every match of Roman. Felt really bad for Cody. Now it feels like Roman can't fight alone without his so called "Bloodline"
Fake asf and yall still watch it 💀
Cody Rhodes already winners in this match chiter is Roman
Cody finally got his Family's due just being in the top spot. Yessir  what an arc. Entrance broke me up a little.
Homelander?
Roman Reigns in Thanos voice : "I am inevitable" 👌
Stupid storyline
Roman is king 👑
Cody Rhodes ACKNOWLEDGE ☝️ ME 😏😏😏😏
We are  missing dean
I can't believe they stripped this year from Cody. I'm a huge roman reigns fan, always have been a reigns fan since he was in nxt. But Cody should've won that championship.
Cody deserved to win but again WWE and favoritism Roman
Acknowledge Him ☝️
Cody sucks, a guy came outta nowhere and everybody wanna giva him belt. Almost three years, 3 years Roman is Champion & you think he should've lose & hand him belt 🖕
Cody’s a good wrestler but it would’ve been emotional seeing the tribal chief lose, been here since day one uce ☝🏽
the Roman empire will be eternal, ROMAN is the king of WWE
What a bang it would have been if all of a sudden the lights went out and that certain song played... Theme Song "Rest In Peace" “🖤💀
Took the hole bloodline to beat Cody Rhodes
1000 day acknowledge ☝️😈☝️
Roman should've stayed gone 🙄
Can't wait to see that Cody vs Brock match and then the might be a triple threat match for the championship.
Roman is who i am with i think hes the Champion, but Cody is so damn Skilled and it would be awesome if he won but i want to see Roman as champ
This was a great match to watch. Exciting, action, more excitement and more action. While i am happy Roman (still) Reigns Supreme, part of me was also hoping Cody Rhodes would come out on top, victorious, AAAAANNND NEEEEEWEEW Undisputed WWE Heavyweight Champion. Hell i was even hoping Goldust would've made a special appearance and interfered in the match (as Solo Sikoa did) to help Cody win the title. Cody deserved this moment at the grandest of all wrestling stages, but hopefully this just means his time is yet to come. Until then i, i shall continue to Acknowledge my Tribal Chief as the Head of the Table.
☝🏻🐐
Roman will be champion then now forever ✅☝️🐐🐐🐐
Roman reigns ☝☝☝☝☝
No it was not  roman will always be  the champion  nothing  but respect for roman
Love this match Great WRESTLEMaina Main Event 20 years ago Kurt Angle vs brock lesnar. 10 years ago THE Rock vs John Cana this year Roman REIGNS vs Cody RHOdes love pro Wrestling business 😍😍❤️
WWE once again fails to strike while the iron is hot. Hope they have a grand plan because there is a huge risk of killing Cody's hype.
Damn 66k likes  76k dislikes 🤯
I hate  roman reigns and the entire clan,,,they just a family of cheats only
It doesn't matter if Cody wins the next one. It won't feel the same. They had a chance to make this a moment, but they blew it
por favor se merece que gane Cody Rhodes, el otro ya tuvo su momento y ya paso su tiempo. Cody Rhodes el mejor
Cody Rhodes el mejor.
Cody must have won... Where is the management of WWE  Why it has allowed chaos like that. Why it kept sillent towards Roman' cheat
Roman wins the belt, But Cody wins people heart ❤️
Disappointed. I like both characters as that is what they are. They are playing a role. If Cody wants a rematch, then go up against other title holders, win the match and belt.  This will entice Roman to go after the belt and put all belts on the line with no interference.
Sad for Cody, he will never get this kind of hype and opportunity again. And so the Reign of the Tribal Chief continues...
Roman reigns is one of the biggest cheater in WWE history. He won his every matches by cheating. He cannot won his matches without cheating
Real winner is cody ❤
Who told Cody to wear that Ezio Auditore da Firenze costume to the ring....If Brandy don't get that man together 😂😂
FIRE VINCE
Fire Vince
Reconozcan al jefe tribal 🎉
I had to say. Roman can't win a fair fight without his family helping him. Why ask competition if can't win a fair fight. Put Roman in a cage with Cody Rhodes and will see if Roman is really the fighter he think he is.
This match was so spectactular, I was rooting for Roman, Roman was so great, he wins better.
At this point Roman will never loose
This is now my 2nd favorite Wrestlemania moment of all time (Daniel Bryan winning at WM 30 is #1). The fact that I got what I wanted and SO MANY PEOPLE DID NOT...just gives me so much more joy. Thank you WWE for doing the RIGHT thing and giving me this moment.  👆👆👆👆👆
Wrestlemania ,  Acknowledge me, I an G# Mode Now 🖕🖕🖕
what a lame job for a so called highlights
Fun fact 😂If you look at 5:30 you will know it is scripted
L,equipe de Roman lse tricheurs
Not a Hollywood fairytale ending. Honestly, I prefer tragedies.
One off the best match ever... this is the best best forever... cody rocks....❤ Romon sucks...🤣😂🤬
Roman Reigns ❤❤❤❤❤❤💪💪💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The right man won wrestling is better when Roman is champ
Unfair gewinnt Roman wie immer ,cody hätte gewinnen sollen hab es ihm so gegönnt 😢
Roman❤❤❤
Roman can never win a match against Cody in a clean match without sakowa and the two brothers.
Great now we‘ll get another year of interference finishes from the bloodline until WM40😴No way the titles change hands at any other PPV than Mania. And who’s he gonna face? Reigns (sorry i mean the bloodline) already beat any credible opponent.
The real forever champion
Yeaah Romain ❤❤❤❤❤
roman reigns brother is cheater
Roman Reigns win with usos help with cheat he sucks
Ooo
ROMAN WINSSSSSS!!!!!🎉🎉
Always cheers for tribal chief ☝️☝️
Lowde kaa championship
ROMAN REIGNS EL MEJOR
👍👍👍👍
Ah
Great :)
First night was great. Second night boring!
Roman Is Not A Chief He Is A Thief
I’m someone who is rewatching Wwe now, after a decade. I remember Cody being an above avg superstar 10-15 years ago . Look at bro now !
Good
Roman reigns someone is claiming that she is your girlfriend. She is in a news in Philippines BITAG OFFICIAL CHANNEL in YouTube
kevin gemok tuu poyo giler..sami pun sama acah lebih..menang pun nasib jelah
Roman is such a coward
Cody look like Steve from Tekken lol 😂
Roman Reigns will be champion until GTA 6 comes out
triple h sir please change the champion. we want to see new world champion..very bore to see Roman over 2 year's pls sir change
omg.. wwe is so aweful... codys look is rediculus, clown outfit..its wrestlemania, not time to visit your family,, that doesnt make any sense! roman entrance or set up also super lame... why is he on a mic ?  and geez how can anyone get into the match, it so predictable.. way too many false finishes... and its all a set up.. how can u have emotion attachment to something so ungenuine...
Am tired of seeing Roman win 😒
Why is the result not shown. Anyone can tell? In simple word.
I miss stones cold
Cheating by Roman real winner is Cody Rhodes
Outstanding match but the ending sucked. Getting a bit repetitive with outside help for Roman. From the build up, Cody should have won that night.
Cody Rhodes is the winner
Vince wont ever give it up.
Roman Reigns, who loves Roman Reigns, put a like
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ouais tribal chief
Cody Rhodes is really champion
Bro Cody was about to win
3 -1
Cody wins respect this is not 1 vs 1 this is 5 vs 1
I'm getting tired of the bloodline saving roman that was Cody's win they ruined the testlemania moment
I taught cody is stardust?
Con Brock
6:39 when Roman looks at the titles and raise them, the camera movements and the song really fit together, EPIC! 👌
🤦🤦🤦.. always Usos helping Roman to win....
I am a Roman fan. But the Ending really Sucked
☝️
Roman in the king of all 😇😇😇
Full match video 😡😡😡

tribal chief ☝🏻
Roman is vary roudy
Great job. I’m just as done with you now as I am with AEW. Maybe put some AWA on the network, aside from two episodes with Shawn Michaels, so I have something good on there to watch.
Romein reng re king ,😡
Ahhh them feathers on his back only because it was on peacock 😂
All the huge build up to Cody and his dad? lead up to this?.. shame on you guys frfr, they’re gonna end up giving Cody the intercontinental champion and waste him or something xd
The Rock Must Defeat Roman Regins At ppv this year
My favourite Roman Reigns
No es gallo solo se cubre de otros para ganar no es un campeón...peleas uno a unos  ...
Yawn....what a waste.....terrible.
Pero que le ah pasado a Román antes era una bestia imparable
욕심 많고 양심 없는 변태 할아버지, 제발좀 오지마세요.

Figured this wrestlemania would suck & it did
Nunca entendi como um farsante como Roman que não ganha nada sozinho, todas as lutas são com ajudas, é campeão ...
Siempre con ayuda gana
😢 we need a rematch
Making two bilts is something stupid
Roman rens U lusar
I love you roman
Empire goes to Roman Reigns
Roman can't win alone every match he gets assisted his not a champ
It should be cody the champ. Roman can't win it alone he always gets assisted by his partners. Alone he can't win.
تستاهل يا زعيم دخيل ربك
Bloodline? Just a clan of coward!!!
Forget the ending, this was a tremendous Wrestlemania main event. Incredible match. Cody will be champ at some point and Roman brought his A game.
There's a reason less and less people watch wwe now and it's because of this man
For years this company been looking for it’s next John Cena I truly believe Cody Rhodes can be that.
Cody deserved to win
Real winner is chody roman is cheater
Stunner , Halluver kick still kicked out ! proves how tuff reigns is as a Champ
He had it 80% , I am a Roman Fan but still would say the story of Cody is Touchy , Sensitive , Inspirational but he is just not there ! I hope if WWE is thinking Cody as the next champion then they should build him like that , he has to go through every other people that roman defeated ! Which will put Cody on the same level as Reigns ! 1 year we have time Next WM 40 They should again do it and Cody wins it
This is the fourth or fitfth time in a row a Roman match has ended thanks to a Ref bump. How is it possible that the creative team cannot find a script other than this one? C'mon!!!
The way roman just controlling the crowds at the beginning was amazing. Even you like him or not, aknowlege him ☝🏻
This was Cody's time!!! Why can't you leave Roman win for himself. He is keeping the belts because every matches someone is helping him and we watching for a very long time. Roman's matches are now too boring.
Acknowledge your Tribal Chief ☝️☝️ still the undisputed WWE universal Champion... ROMAN REIGNS
I love Roman but Cody was amazing...❤🔥🔥
It ends in tears
2:00 Thank god he matched that epic drop! 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Its high time they crown a new champion already. Its now roman's wwe and  its now boring
يابطل ياكودي💪🙏
Over 4 million views, & only 84k likes, that's how bad they effed this up.
Roman Reigns was most pushed from 2015-2018 when his character wasnt really good he main evented roughly 4 Wrestlemanias and was second to no one, and now his character is absolutely the best and carries the whole of WWE using common sense we all know the answer he is walking in Wrestlemania 40 and 41 with the Universal Title again, main eventing again and again
Cody did say he's goings to Wrestlemania where his journey ends well guess what it ends
0:20 still gave me chills everytime i repeat listenin to it . Cody future legend sooner or later <3
As much as I wanted Cody to win, I see why they did this. They can milk this story out a whole lot, plus there was always the fear that fans might turn on Cody because of how hot Sami is right now . They made the right call, having Sami get his moment while pushing this further, because there just wasn’t enough of a buildup between the two. Two months wasn’t enough. Plus with the usos losing their belts, it opens up a whole new angle for the bloodline where it starts internally crumbling. Cody will be champion soon, but there’s much to do before that happens. And anyone in any promotion would die to switch places with him. He’s feuding with the biggest stars, reigns and lesnar, at the same time right now and comes out looking like a credible threat to both. The only way belts changed hands this mania imo is if Sami was the challenger. Which originally should’ve been the case but it is what it is
Wwe, plz stop this bloodline, its very annoying now. why roman cant defend his title himself everytime his family member will come to save his title
The Big Dog 💪 💪
roman cant win his own matches ,is he really that great if the bloodline keeps helping him  as the the great one would say to the millions he is the biggest a-hole walking the gods green earth ,roman is a fake hes nothing without the usos and that wannabe umaga
Cody rhodes theme song ❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥
Chutya khatam ho gaya roman range tital bachane ke liye cheting se jeetra.  Thu iski zindagi patt
Cody made us believe in him for nothing 😆
Ruined storyline
The right person won
Blessed Young man and a beautiful family ❤❤❤
Can't win without help
Because of Roman reigns I hate WWE
This match is worst and Roman reigns is worst wrestler I have ever seen
Useless fight with no rules and regulations of any kind.  Such people look boob, I hate you wwe fight! 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 Lol wwe ❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
WTF we saw nothing 😮😮😮😮
The crowd was so lit this entire WrestleMania. Such a chance wasted to make cody the champ
Roman Reigns is the modern day Bruno Sammartino in terms of being undefeated! Feel bad for Rhodes but 'hard times breed better men.'
Only roman Reigns 😈🎉
Roman was best when he had positive role in WWE but now so disgusting in negative role coz everytime cheating to win the match
Great finsh ACKNOWLEDGE  HIM The G.O.A.T
The day Roman Reigns has a match without interference from the Bloodline will be the day I become a billionaire.
Cody rhodes if are you bad roman reigns is your dad
Love triple h for not giving this guy a chance❤️❤️🫡🤲🏾. Hes just not it. Im sorry cant vision him being the man in the 90s 2000s or 10s. Hes just not it. Thank you hhh
WWE you broke our dream
paul Heyman is historical Pet Dog of roman..
That wasn't even a fair fight bro Im so mad right now I hate the bloodline😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠🖕
Next time put roman reigns fights in a steel cage  Coz unfair matches are boring 😴
Roman Reigns the best
Stuped storyline WWE it was Cody's time
i hate the usos, i just miss old roman version (2019)
Before Stardust: Where's my push?? Vince: Written in the stars Now Cody: I tore my pec at HIAC. I'll finish the story for my father Dusty Rhodes HHH: Story never ends Vince: Forget your story
Worst ending 😐
Cody was cheated out that
HaHaHa😅😅😅😂😂😂Good Roma
Acknowledge the tribal chief
Cody will not be WWE champ. No way. Why would they put a guy who started AEW over like that????? Why????? I hope the AEW locker room watched particularly MJF. Because if this clown MJF thinks they going to put a belt on him he has lost his mind. Cody Rhodes was burried by WWE tonight. He may or may not win this belt ut not at the expense of Reigns........go listen to media scrum after this. Triple H basically threw him under the bus saying THE STORY CONTINUES........dude is not winning. When his contract is up dont be surprised seeing him back in AEW.........
I truly say we walk away from this trash. Screw Roman! I could care less if I ever see him again
Roman reigns as a heel is the best thing wwe has done in a while
Cody will 100% dethrone reigns just not yet  🤝
Usos and solo are roman's sidekick
There must be a rematch between cody and roman without anyone interference.
It should be more surprising if Solo then pinned Roman and became the new champion.
This arena needs to feel the same in wwe 2k24 , it just can’t be the same size as all the others
Its officially saying wwe bookings are bad now
Cody had it man…. He had it
After the return in two WrestleMania he face two shield members I wish he face dean at WrestleMania 40
Worse highlight y’all created solo came outta nowhere y’all skipped so many main parts luckly I was there
Romen lujar man
ভালো
ভালো ভিডিও হয়েছে 😮😮😮
Roman you’re the reason I stopped like wrestling and you’re preventing me from liking it again
If cody loses, then Sami and Ko should have lost also
Cody doesn't have mainstream appeal. He's appreciated due to his family lineage, but he's no Brock Lesnar or John Cena
6:27
Acknowledge The Roman Reigns He is Face Of WWE
im a roman reigns fan but i feel bad for cody
WHAT A MATCH
Cody
What's upsetting is that we have to see Roman's reign for about another year. He is a part-timer and plays once every three months. is this the champion?
Roman will loose is beat thiz year to Brok
Code loses his title
If you inspect the BG audience really closely you'll see Matan Even AKA Bill Clinton Kid
Roman Reign The King of cheating.
We the ones☝
Thanks bud for keepin us financially Educated! Regardless of how bad it gets on the economy, I still make over $22,000 every single week.
useleess video
Roman win by the help of cousin.... since b4
Thank u wwe for keeping regins on top, Cody didn't earn it yet especially comin in the royal rumble at 30
Who wants Jinder Mahal as champion again? Anybody but this joke
Roman Reigns ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Cody look like John cena 😅
We all know that Cody Rhodes was supposed to win this WrestleMania 39 championship but like always Roman Reigns needed his goonzquad cousins to help him because he knew he was gonna lose the match . Now I understand why Cody asked him for another match against him and Solo . But unfortunately Brock Lesnar turned on Cody Rhodes the American Nightmare . I'll anyone that Vince McMahon had something to do with Brock Lesnar doing what he did . That to me as a fan made me pissed off because we're not just talking about a good guy but we're talking about Dusty Rhodes son Cody Rhodes who would have been the new WWE heavyweight champion 🏆 but like always Roman had those teo chumps awho are no longer the tag team undisputed champions . Now that it's over for them I'm pretty sure that possibly next year wrestlemania 40 will be the time that he loses the championship ! 🇺🇸💯💩🤡
It was worst setup Roman didn't put any effort to keep good fight ... half effort would have easily won ...but it's WWE 😉
Right now i can say to Every one in this whole world that "Acknowledge Him 🤙
Who is the original winner... Codyy
Cody is the winner but solo's DEFENCEEE
This sucks,everyone is sick and tired of Roman being champion,and what's worse he's reacting better talent because of the bloodline,Seth,Brock,John,Drew,Kevin,more and now Codhy.They do things to make it look like there a new champ but we should no the B.L. Comes and ruined it🙄😣😥😮😩🤕😱😤💀😠😡😠😡😠😡😠😵😧😦🤑🙀💩👎💔💣💢💤🍅🌧🌩🔥
Roman reigns best player of all time...
I get it now Why WWE made Cody Lose Roman needs to reach 1000 days as the champion I guess now we getting a build up for Cody to Dethrone Roman
Cody Rhodes fans are so stupid just look at the opponents Roman has faced in this reign alone. First Cody has to beat the opponents Reigns has faced in this run, then he can come challenge for the title.
Roman now commands respect, one hand movement for the crowd to hush without words, and they obeyed lol. ❤☝🏿
Cody deserved it man
Cody is a champion, because Roman rings is a cheeter
Cody❤❤
Cody  Cody Cody
Cody Rhodes did his best , it was a very big opportunity to take over the universal championship but it seemed like it reigned from the sky and showed him that the road  was too slippery for him to get there. Well done Roman Reigns..  congratulations to you . I'm one of your biggest fan and shout out to the Usos
He can't win without help😂😂😂
Rematch!!!
Roman Reigns‘ tournament is the most boring one in history.
We love roman ..❤.. The head of table...
Just look man face of roman reings 5:04
Hoping next match cody, sami, ko, are together to defeat Roman and usos
Roman you really are a ..... huh?  Who you kneeling for? I guarantee if those matches weren't scripted, they would probably all go quite a bit different! 😊
Poor acting
LLL REALLY SHOULD OF MADE CODY WIN
Cody needs to get them moles or whatever they are cut off. Come on man you got money
Kody ke kapde ek raaja se kam nahi 😀😂❤️
Wasted opportunity I'll leave it there.
I like Roman but this was the wrong call. Cody deserved it man. Triple H I hope you don't turn into a Vince.
Should’ve never smashed the throne in AEW
Cody looks like takeshi castle guy 😂
All fans you respect
One on one undisputed wwe championship rematch start
Cody vs Roman rematch next match right now
Roman is tha Cheeter
How fake you want it...
What a trash outcome
damn that entire match was epic but the finish just had to be trash. cody should have won. reigns is just too stale now just give us cody as champ
Cody we love you
Ratiya bakwas Sanjay Jain
if roman and cody fight 1vs1 and no one other interfere in their match so i can tell  100% cody will be win the match
Khatiya bakwas Kevin oven ko
Love you Roman
Roman reigns like kid always his cousins protect him 😂😂😂😂
Roman is bull dog
It's not universal it's undisputed universal championship
Roman one of the best cheater in the planet😂😂
Porq ahora representa América nigh
Sigue siendo mierda luchadora más lo q lo ovacionan
Roman Reigns's reign continues....
This was @CodyRhodes moment @WWE screwed him. So sad, His whole family was in attendant @WWERomanReigns cheated to win,I hope Cody gets the rematch he so desperately deserves it. It's not the end of the story , it's just the end of a chapter. Cody will definitely defeat roman.
People need to understand that this wasn't the right time, and it would have not done this storyline justice. He isn't on that level yet they want to push him even more to the point he will bring in the number's that are being brought by the head of the Table and sell merch
Cody has given ultimate his best cheerssss for codyyyyy
Cody deserves that belt🎉
What they thinking, are want roman be champ forever rest of his life, bored
Cody Rhodes ❤
Hahaha 🤣😂 Cody Rhodes 😂😂 your father is a won 😂😂😂😂
I said it earlier that cody has no balls to defeat REIGNS.  ROMAN REIGNS said he can retain the titles as long as he wants My question is can REIGNS win fights without the bloodline intervention? ?  My answer is no  KO would've dethroned him.  Randy Orton is the only o e that has the tactics to beat REIGNS one on one without bloodline.
American nightmare will be American dream someday
Roman Reigns won with the help of usos
In real Cody wins
Brock lesner❤❤
nolesirvrs paranada acodi rou eschaleganad tu solo llak teafamas de ser el megor con alluda .. solo noleaguantas
Rr
WWE when you are going to drop the title from Roman reign
Codys well played
Ok HERE ME OUT!!! I don’t think anyone her had a problem with Roman winning. It’s how he won. Everyone wanted to see a fight between the head of the table and the American nightmare not a fight between Sami meve in the ISO’s and solo sikoa. It just makes Roman look weak and it wasn’t fair to Cody he had that match win
Better if McMahon family handovers WWE to the Bloodline.😡
That's my Tribal Chief! Still has the belts! But there was no way Cody would win. WWE has to put together a big event for Roman's 1,000th day as champion which is coming up. This couldn't have worked for anyone else.
Oh yes my king!!.... Next time Cody. You did a great job but not good enough.
هذا سيئ جدا وممل ومقرف زاد الوضع عن حده كثيرا جدا
Dude reigns being champ is just old at this point, give us a break it’s been almost 3 years. Cody shoulda won.
Brock
As I told Cody never  touch romanrings legacy
Brick coming  the belt of diseases had no mercy Roman wiins looks darkness fallowes
they should’ve stopped pushing roman after him vs Brock Lesnar
Cody's time 😂😂😂 Brock Lesnar 😀😀
Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow roman got all his family again!!!!!!!!!!! To help him!!!!!!!!! Just like what he did in his last matchessssssss. He knew Cody will win   Wwe superstars in the locker room if you wanna have a match with girl roman it need to be in  Cage fight
I miss old roman
Reconoscanme
As usual Roman can't win without help
This is the wrong heartbreak ending.....Rhodes should have went over, but Theory should still have MITB and ruined Cody's moment.
Roman never wins with out help never
Wwe is a mother chode it is not a video
you telling me stardust almost beat roman reigns?
How do you have a highlight reel that doesn't include the pin? What a joke....
Pouvez vous traduire en français svp une mamie ❤❤❤
Went exactly like it was suppose to!!
You messed up with that real bad
Cody Rhodes should have won.
No es por nada pero ya cansa ver a Román reings con esos campeonatos y ganando siempre con la ayuda de los primos bah
Cody got smashed lol.😅
7:23 I'm surprised they didnt blurr that lmao
Cody will get them eventually probably at summer slam
Triple H is going to regret doing that ending
figure 4
no avian de enganar las personas con esas luchas libre falsas avian de se cerios y legales los de wuelsol menia queremos la Rebancha en laJaula aber si ally va ha ganar Roman Rey
Roman🔥
Este campeonato es una estafa Román reing cómo siempre apoyado por el árbitro la empresa y otros aquí no hay seriedad Román reing es un mal campeón cobarde
Kodi úgynézki mint a diótörő😂
The finishing shouldn't have been removed.
The match was great, the outcome not so much.
Roman you will always win
Awesome to see cody at this point versus where he was with stardust. Roman has been a favorite of mine since he came in, dont care for how much they make him cheat but it fits the heel character.
Wwe sucks as well
Roman fully sucks😡
Day by day wwe is becoming trash
Reigns always cheats never a fair match he's boring to watch now
Great performance cody real champions
its so sad WWE is just so lazy and cringe they made cena lose and cody lose dont udnerstand how can they find having 1 champ  with 2 belts is fun lmao  for so long
this was bull that should of been 100% Cody's I'm tired of seeing Roman being lazy, this match only look good because Cody know how to give the fans what we want, This needs to stop this story line is completely garbage, the fact that jimmy and jay are broken down to lackeys is sad. Why waste the resources to make roman the face of the company it isn't working, lets be honest it has come to many attention including mines that roman's in ring performances has be less than the bare minimum than a  saplings firs month in training. who ever thought this was a good has defiantly severely dropped the ball .
Geese Howard wrestling in Wrestlemania is the greatest thing I'll ever see.
very disappointing they didn't make cody win
I’m so sick of Roman reigns like Vince need to give somebody else the belt already
Cody is not big enough to beat the tribal chief, next please 😂
Reigns du saftkopf
Roman reigns cheater, originally wins Cody ❤
Cody's moment and I hope a fight the no want get in to
Ion even care like that thank god Roman won
cody entrance costume is fye as hell🔥
Huge L for the WWE Universe.
This had Vince's fingerprints all over it...pity.
Heck yeah we wanted a new champion come on . Roman was a covid champion that era is almost done so should have his era but oh well. I can't wait for more fights  though with Roman really no help from other people.
So bad roman is very cheap ,🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤬🤬🤬🥵🤬🤬🥵😡
Cody should've stayed in AEW.... This is almost as bad as WWE's handling of Sting.
Shitshow from WWE
Cody fought like a man 😮
Song name pls
You are not the franchise of WWF
yeah when you know the wrestlemania main event has less likes than dislikes it was a mistake
Okay it's gonna be a cage match the next time they fight for championship and it's gonna be a triple threat with Cody winning over Lesnar and Roman and i am calling it right here
Poor storyline... Roman again wo with help... No guts to play... Beggar always begs to acknowledge and not seen regularly... Someone or other help him to win..  HHH Please give others chance to win... BORED SEEING HIM... PREDICTABLE STORY
Roman reigns is very cheating😮😮
This is garbage why would they decide something like this
roman had to cheat as usual can't manage own his own he was well and beat by Cody he is no use own his own he needs back up what a sham
Cody Rhodes fans just kept crying. But we, Roman Reigns fans, will continue to celebrate. This is not Cody's chance, and this is not his time. Sami Zayn really deserved it, but it did not happen
i hope one day, he lose to Edge, CM PUNK or someway somehow the Undertaker.
An stilll…. 😎
roman z nothing just a cheater
good job Roman
Roman real loin
Roman boring. To many 🥩🚴. Only thing Roman got is the longest reign which is the decision of Vince whoever runs it. Crowd proved it at the end. It wasn’t loud for Roman but loud and disappointed Cody lost.
Azz ending. Imagine bringing out your whole family and taking an L. Roman has massive plot amour. Won’t be touched. John cena “bootleg”
Everyone who comes from njpw got highlighted too much at first just like finn balor . Then are vanished time by time. Now it's cody time. But at a time, roman reigns is always face for wwe.
What happened to GOD MODE hahahaha OPS
☝.
రోమన్😂😂😂
Hiii
Esa pelea no se vale porque solo sicoa golpio h cody Ros avian de Repetirlo
Roman Reigns king He defeats anyone without help
Roman Reigns king
Roman Reigns ❤️❤️
queremos una luchAS DE CODY RHODES VS ROMAN  EN UNA JAULA DE ACERO SOLO ELLOS DOS QUE DICE EL PUBLICO ESA ES LA REVANCHA Q QUEROMOS VAMOS CODY }
Roman Reign s is the wrestlemania main event but Cody did well wasn’t it for the Usos and solo sikoa
Roman Reings the big cheater all of time 😂
Nice way to ruin a really good wreslemania...
Bet this video is the most disliked video now on this channel
I think this show is only for roman reigns just whoever comes beaten up by reigns 😂 what a freaking show 😅
Cheat with cody😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Roman Reigns ❤❤❤
Roman is a part time champ
Nobody deserves  another  with roman reigns  as long as he is champion not even  Cody roman did not need  any help i have a lot of respect  for roman
Poda 99999999
This is why wwe Is a absolute dumpster fire funny how HHH is trying to be like Tony Kahn thanking everyone for coming  out sad really try teaching your roster some actual wrestling if you don't like the comment oh well just be upset I guess 🤣🤣🤣🤣
A lot of the folks who saw this live are talking about how quiet the crowd was after the match ended. Fact is, the Bloodline doesn't have any good stories left to tell. That's the difference between this win and every other win. They wrapped the story up from every angle but refused to end it. Now we have Reigns as the Undisputed Champion for no reason. There's no reason to watch them anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if Vince returned just to spite Cody by calling for his loss.
Roman will lose every match if his dogs don't interrupt
WWE  This is your first and last warning. And I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who feels the same. Roman is not going to be remembered as one of the greats no matter how long he has the belts!!!  He hasn't won a match, on his own. In over a year at least. It's  time for a new champion!!! And if he doesn't lose his belts. At the next big PPV he defends at or before. I will be cancelling my Peacock account until he loses the belts PERIOD!!!
❤️❤️so naice ❤️❤️ subscraib me com fast
What kind of useless highlight was this?😂 no Roman offense showed at all, didn’t show his entrance, didn’t show how the match ended. Was this Highlight made by Cody Rhodes?😂
Roman always used cheat
Roman cheating wwe 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cody deserves the title. One day you’ll be. ❤
cody rhodes lookin like homelander
Always Roman, King of WWE❤
Cody wrestles with 4 .Bravo Cody.
Homelander vs Aquaman the best match ever🎉🎉
Cody had the match.  Most of the time that Roman has won. . Thank to Usos .
What a farce. People are bored with the same old garbage from reigns.
Roman Reigns 😈💥💙
They've been pushing for a 1000 day title Reign for Roman since way back. It wasnt really surprising that Cody lost.
Roman 🔥🔥🔥
Wwe's respect is only Tribal Cheif+HHH
Seth only smash his right boob, Tribal Cheif will smash+crash his leg also if he didn't stop mind it
Cody is nothing in front of Tribal Cheif nothing repeat 1000 times cody is scrap only Nothing Nothing Tribal Cheif will smash him cras him mind it
It was a classic match 🔥🔥
Shame wwe Shame
Roman is a true Champion true legend no one i repeat no one like him, he is the Cheif of the King of the Kings
Roman love ❤
roman is so hot
Cody Child finished in one spare 😂😂
Holy hell I’m tired of Roman being champ. I guarantee they do something stupid like give us a Roman V Theory match and Theory wins 😂😂
They got to pass that belt to someone who fights by himself.Roman sucks .
เข็มขัดทองไปไหน สองอันนี้ไม่สวยเลย
Man what a missed opportunity. Cody should have won
that script was very boring
Another trick of WWE to protect roman reigns always send somebody to help him win
❤❤❤ 😢 no no bobbin😊😊
How long they going to let him keep the damn title
Cody deserve the belt
The Big 🐕😂😂😂😂
Cody is the winner
Roman Reigns and there doges are very clever he is always cheating
Cody would have beaten Roman if he was not interrupted by Roman's dogs
Roman reigns is worst wrestler on this match
This was the time to change hands with the title. It should've happened a long time ago but this was the right time and they still couldnt do it. Unbelievable. Roman is such a boring champion and they're trying to make him seem amazing, Cody should've been the guy. Hell, I thought drew Mac should've been the guy to do it in his home town but they didn't do that either. I just feel like this has Vince all over it, idk.. and once again, same finish. Every time. How many times are they going to do this
now I know Roman is the face of WWE, the icon of this generation, but anybody else feels bored with this story?
This match was insane !!!!
Roman is LOOOOSER!
Roman is best wrestler's
Don't storyline real flight, ok
Scripted daily soap 😅😅😅😅
Madarchodo full match to dikha dete Sara mood kharab kr diya
Roman reigns wow
Roman Reigns
i mean isnt boring only roman winning ? how you guys give money to watch same thing over and over again.
Even if Cody hit the 3 cross roads I don't think Roman would lose he could have kicked out. I have seen Roman kick out of 5 F5s.
The death of wwe begins from now
Script
I’m I the only one who is tired of seeing one Man as champion! Should get different moves at list but same moves over 3 years and I am really really tired of that. Rhodes came back with new moves and enjoyed his side but for champion side, I get bored. I almost slept on the main event wrestlemania!  That’s not entertaining
I swear if Vince is back then the fans should start chanting something like "get out Vince" as loud as they can. The man is freaking 77! And the Raw after was just wierd, outta nowhere Brock came into the picture only to mess up things more GET VINCE OUT!!! COME BACK TRIPLE H!!
Roman has no charisma. Boring dude
Where is the full match between flair and rhea ??
Roman is cheletar 👿👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Total missed opportunity, which is becoming normal for WWE. Built up a story that was to be unique, to only make it the same old story. I had a feeling this would happen, and am still disappointed. Cody can fade away now, because they did what they wanted to do, destroy his credibility completely. I am not mad, I just don't care if Cody wins the belt now. That story is finished, just like he has been saying. Go tag with others. Go after the intercontinental. Start some "doesn't mean anything" rival. It really does not matter anymore. Time to break from WWE for a bit I guess, because there really is no interesting stories.
I rhing BROK  LESNER IS  COMING  FOR  YOU  ROMAN ,  REMBMER  THAT
If u have to fake it please do it in such a way that it does not seem too obvious.  Every main event game, a referee is hit and a referee is so ridiculously weak that he doesn't get up till u have to really end the match as you desire.
Yesterday, I had a dream. It was 2030 and Roman Reigns was still the champ,  asking for acknowledgement, even after being the champion for almost 10 years. 😂
Roman sucks 🎉
Huge W match. Cry muricans 😂🤣
The reigns need to be handed over to someone else
Crowd saying "whoa" is one of the loudest pops I have ever heard in wwe
I feel bad for Cody and his family but don't worry Cody you will get it if they're time royal rumble you'll win again❤🥺💖🤞🤛😥
I don’t see what RR taught to CR as said by him during promo besides his team got onto the ring in drove to help RR win😂
Roman Reigns King Of WWE 🤴
Congratulations. This is truly last day of  WWE.
colonial dressing racist
Can't win without help of ussos
Stupid match
Roman Reigns vs Cody Rhodes was amazing at WrestleMania 39 👏👏👏
Please WWE give Cody Rhodes a rematch against Roman Reigns to finish the story,,, please,only Cody Rhodes is the man who deserve to dethrone Roman Reigns,,he promise us that he gonna do it, but it didn't happen, so please give Cody Rhodes one more chance to finish the story very soon, he give me the inspiration to finish my story,,, please he deserves those titles and deserve to beat Roman's historical strict 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Cody brother please  FINISH THE STORY 🔥🔥🔥

The goat 🐐..the best of best  ROMAN REIGNS 😍
who tf watches this shiddy scripted shi man what the hell💀💀💀💀
Roman reigns he is the cheater layer player
Cody is the best performance & he is the man
ලංකාවේ එවුන් නැද්ද 😂💔
WWE haven’t had enough of Roman Reigns?
Well wwe we need a new champion now
Code is smarter
Cody should have won The next match I’ll see if WWE would be next title defence by roman Until then goodbye WWE It really broke my heart!
This film of yours are not longer interesting anymore 😏😏
Roman Power🔥
Childhood favorite
That's stardust 😅
Wwe 😂😂chutiya giya hain aare ab toh dusre ke hath de championship ko.
Cody came out in the George Washington suit
Bron breaker versus Roman reigns confirmed
When Kevin Owens AKA KO and sammy Zayn came into the ring that was shocking 😮😅😅
Rip Solo Sikoa
Kinda sad to see that Reigns only wins to hold the title for 1000 days (and don’t try to tell me anything different; Cody’s Story was built up perfectly till now)
At least Cody Rhodes tried 👍🤘👍🤘
ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਲੰਬਾ ਸਮੇਂ ਦਾ ਬੇਈਮਾਨ  ਚੈਂਪੀਅਨ ਰੋਮਨ ਹੈ
And this is why I didn’t buy the ppv, I knew they were going to pass Cody again.
Cody Rhodes has children 😮😮😮 😊😊
WrestleMania 31 Sting Vs Triple H, no creativity of WWE. You soo fool Cody really stupid.
Cody should have won
It´s time to see another champion
Roman reigns  all time WWE  king
Roman Reigns is the best wrestler i am big fan of Roman Reigns
Roman reigns is so boring! This was the worst mstch of the entire event!
Cody really needs Randy to neutralize Solo.
ALL WWE SUPERSTARS GOING BECAUSE OF THEIR WORST BOOKING AND ONLY PUSH ROMAN REIGNS PIZ CHANGE CHAMPION WWE HEAD ACTIVITIES YOU MOTHERF***KER 🤬🤬🖕🖕🖕
Robin is bad nature
All time cheating Robin no win without spot
This match awesome compared than other day 1 and day 2 matches.. Acknowledge the tribal chief
☝☝
Cody Rodhes is the best
wtf was that.
ALL YOU CAN DO IS ACKNOWLEDGE HIM ☝🏽
Yessir big win😊
This is rubbish!
The rhodes bloodline is weak. None of them have captured the big one. None of them will. Maybe Cody's daughter will solve racism by winning the championship in 20 years.
Fake show
Yes WWE didn't let Cody win in WrestleMania because it was too early. Cody has to show more, prove more to the wwe universe before actually winning the undisputed championship. So wwe is pushing him to fight against big wwe superstars like Brock Lesnar, possibly edge, drew, Bobby etc later in the future.  So he can finally show that he is the true deserving person to defeat the tribal chief.
Cronglajuleshan wwe 1 day 2M vews💗💗
We talking about how Roman buried Cody but we just gonna let the fact that Cody buried solo slide?
The last Wrestlemania main event under Mr Mcmachon 😢
Wwe is all fake😂
Roman Reigns is The Goat🐐!!!!!
I m watching wwe only Romen ❤
worst highlights possible
3:02 man made the entire stadium quite with just a gesture for a while.
Dont worry Cody's Next time you'll be win 🔥🤘 Roman Reigns 👎👎👎👎👎
Cody Rhodes is the only man who can dethrone Roman reigns
Cody give him a run for his money
The head of the table roman reigns
👑Legend trible chief roman reigns
Roman reigns always going to be face of company
This was Cody's moment! Fans were into it. But wwe destroyed it. Cody will never have this same momentum again!
Roman Empire
Acknowledge trible chief roman reigns the legendary 👑
They making fool us and I am not an idiot. People just react wow yea etc.. although this is all fake just like movies.
4:18 homage to Dustin.
4:27 SCOOP SLAM.  Nope, that’d be a power slam Michael.
I went from Mathew McConaughey interstellar crying of happiness when Cody was doing his thing to utter disappointment. I thought wwe was finally going to do something right. I guess slow boring roman pace is best for business...
Trabil chef love you 💖💖💖💖💗💗💗
But amazing match
They did cody dirtyy
Roman reigns overpushed super star..
The big dog 💪
Roman is not deserve this title ,and a cheater player

the worst wrestler of the year, he doesn't know how to fight alone and he gets accompanied by his 3 dogs 😹 which then 3 combos are enough to knock out. roman kingns
It is the begining of a rivality. Everybody thougth that cody will win but it is not is moment, may be at summer slam
Roman Reigns 👍   😮 cody 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎😏
Félicitations en Cody méritait de gagner Romane est un loser et un tricheur. continue comme ça et un homme bien Tu mérites d'être champions Tu as le droit à une revanche mais il faut pas que la blonde like est sicko soir pas là si t'es seul avec romane ajustez vas gagner Oui c'est un gros loser et à tricheur
Acknowledge Roman ☝

Boring WWE
Roman Reigns vs the rock match please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I love the reign of Reigns but man it was Cody's moment ! I'm disappointed and what better could have been after KO and Zayn finishers were deployed. Cody should have hit Cross Rhodes and win there 😔
Universal Championship? Or undisputed WWE Universal Championship 😅
Khankir pola dili na kn wwe championship cody ke
There is no excuse for Reigns winning!!  literally!  😭😭😭 Cody can get all of his family to interfere in the match, it doesn't make sense!! If Reigns deservedly won, we would have accepted it, but the story is that he brings 10 members of his family with him outside the ring, every time someone intervenes, so it's normal he wins every time! Where is the solution to the issue?!  💔💔💔  Congratulations Reigns, but this is really sad!  I don't have a problem with Roman Reigns winning and retaining the titles over and over again, I have a problem with that weak look of him that is not able to win a thing without his family  interfering each time! I mean come on! Cody is half weight brock lesnar, so it's not that hard for Roman to defeat him by his own instead of using another family member!? Am I right?
This Roman Reigns storyline is boring as hell , the title used to change hands be unpredictable and always had plenty of names chasing it. Now it's literally just one person and not even a good enough or worthy character, it's all completely boring. I think people want to believe it's better than it is , but it's so uninteresting. Where is the hype and unpredictable elements , every single ppv finishes with the same image of reigns, Paul hayman and the USos .

Roman ❤
Stupid booking
Thats why i quit wwe,
Big dog Roman empire 🔥❤️❤️
Hi, this WrestleMania 39 was like hell not just for me but for all the wwe pens. I think I deserve to say this because I'm a wwe pen who grew up with wwe since I was a kid. I remember having fun copying Durac and Austin's games with my friends in school, wwe's popularity was sky-high, but I'm looking forward to this WrestleMania 39 now that I've seen a player monopolizing the top 2 brands of the Champion Belt for 3 years, but you've broken my countless evil and sweet dreams. Thought I'd block Roman's solo this time, is your choice really for the future wwe? Now I'm tired of watching wwe anymore, please stop Roman's solo.
Roman very time wins because of his cousins .lol😂
A kid wearing all Cody gear crying next to his father as they were leaving the event broke my heart. How many times are they going to shove down Roman down our throats and disappoint fans like this, especially at mania.
Romans helpers 5:45😐😐😐😶😶
Acknowledge Romen reign
Worst highlight I’ve seen this year
roman is nothing without his bloodline
Roman Reigns ❤
Aujla❤
❤
Ive been watching Roman since the days of the shield and been a huge fan. so im loving this story line and Roman going to be a legand in the future as he is my childhood fav wrestler. Roman is currently the face of WWE AND YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT
And still the undisputed WWE universal champion... History made better luck next time Cody ☝️☝️
Roman is a cheater😡😡
UFC forced WWE to put Roman over cody as they wanted this match to happen after merger so UFC could milk the cash cow as they're 51% owners as opposed to WWE which has 49% ownership
اكو عراقي لو بس اني😂
It was Cody’s time  He deserved that W
Cody giving the weight belt to Lil Brodie was ❤😭
Cody should have won
Loosing interest in wwe
Roman Reigns ☝️ ☝️ ☝️
We love roman reigns
Otra vez van a tirar a Cody a la basura vaya puta vergüenza con el paquete de Román reings
I actually love that they didn't go with the obvious choice. There is still much to get out of the bloodline storyline with Roman on top. It deserves to go on and I doubt the match result will hurt Cody. I think it will make him an even bigger babyface in the long run.
Cheater as ALWAYS atónita
Cody Was Feeling Fire
Cody vs roman rematch 😣
Cody
Bad script
The greatest champion of modern generation tribal chief our head of the table roman ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Roman is the new-age Backlund: waaaaay too long as champ.
Back in my day, Heyman was a skinny kid with a mullett.  Now, he looks like Pizza The Hutt.
Poor editing skills
Me and all my friends are going to bycott wwewwe
we still love cody🔥🔥🙂
Brock lesnar
Roman ❤🎉
There was'nt any disappointment that drowned me as severe as this.. Cody deserves the booking to his win.. The ending was pathetic to be honest. When will they give Roman a clean one on one win? And Cody, I think wont get that title shot nowhere near as today's Brock heel turn points to the brawl between him and Brock at Backlash..

I'm all for keeping people guessing, but it was the perfect time to pay off a great storyline ....
Worst editor
Solo the MVP of the night here
Cody should have won!!!!!! Dislike!!!!!!!!!!!
Roman Reigns ❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
One thing I loved that everyone were supporting both
Well, now after Monday Night Raw...The thing that worries me about this, is it feels like they are just trying to forcefully set up a feud between Cody and Brock, so they dont have to have a rematch between Cody and Roman.  As if they want the fans to ignore that they f'ed up in deciding who won WM39.  Now Cody is going to forget all about Roman, and want to fight Brock instead.  So much for any title matches in the future.  And this is the better story that they wanted to tell, then a new champion, super lame.  The only way I can see this working, is if this was all Romans plan all along (which it doesnt look like it is), and Cody has to defeat the entire Bloodline to get to Roman again.
Cody 🥺🥺🥺
What a wasted opportunity for WWE
And again Roman cant keep the titles without help. Roman is a paper champion and not a real one.
Usos your  belt is retun  for Sami and Kevin ovens .I pleasure for for you
I few hate WWE because John Cena  lose in wrestlemania
Roman Reigns 👆🏻
Roman fans: he's a heel, that's why Roman cheats to win Meanwhile Gunther...
Really disappointed ☹️☹️☹️ thui wwe, it was Cody's time.
That's why I stopped watching wwe , so much fixing
Cody💪💪
I am so tired with this  Roman Reigns always win  That is so boring
I was really confident that WWE will finally give us a shocking yet expected title shift but they rather gave us a disappointing end to the night!
JOOOKE! JOKE JOKE JOKE! 🤮
How did he still won Wtffff this is so rigged man 💀
Hunter failed to pull off a moment of perpetual history for a 24 hr thrill. Suckssssssssssssssss
Cheater roman reighns har baar cheating se jeetta  hai 😡
Boring Boring Boring Boring Boring
I don't understand why he just can't win clean?... even after being in so called god mode and all.... If he had to win just like that....cody would have been a better choice...  These are the things wwe creatives should understand....in main events of marquee events like this there should be clear victories...a clean ending...not by some interferences like its a raw or SmackDown
Cody is real hero ❤
So now is no need to watch WWE
Codey Rhodes vs Roman Reigns ka full match daalo
Use me as dislike button
Man Roman sucks big time now. What a sham.
I think WWE made the right call. For Cody to win would have been too perfect and that is not grounded in reality. I still think he will win the belts but they want to put him through adversity so when he does finally win it will be the culmination of a significant journey to get there.
Long live the king Roman❤
Pathetic WWE 🤦‍♂️ Why is this goon roman still having the belts? 🤦‍♂️
WWE gives all rights to only Roman. We don't want him as a champion anymore we want something new. Please like for Cody Rhodes.
Cheater Roman 😴😴
Roman after telling me what you did the first time we met. This is my first video that I have seen. You was great my sweet man.
Cody deserve to win 💔
Everyone says that Roman is cheater and can't beat alone 🤣😂🤣 You can see 2014 to 2018 Where audience doesn't accepted him but his matches and beaten by so many villain teams ❤❤  He's the guy man...
Cheater Roman... shame
Roman reign can never defend his title until he gets help from his brothers 😂😂what a shame!
Cody fans is big mad rn 😅😅😅
0:20 Goosebumps
Go to jannah ☝️
*Love you Tribal Chief* ❤🎉🎉🎉
Apart from the interferences this match was just squash buckling as both superstars took themself to the limit and digging deeper displaying toughness and will,  and  some of Roman's kick out were insane along with Cody, at one stage both superstars were bound to think what does it take that's all I have 😅😅😅😅
Watched it live for the first time since the 90’s. Highly disappointed, for the main event it should’ve been better. This was a Saturday morning mid card match at best
There must be a rematch between cody and roman without anyone interference.
One of the greatest WM main events ever. Period!
Whatever roman is the wwe's oxygen😊
And where is Ted Debiase?
This is interrupted solo hit cody now paul interfere.and the twins involved. Roman got lucky. I thought this was going to be a clean match. With the help of his cousin. Roman is like a coward.😡
Wwe made a mistake here... Cody should've win this
Everyone knows.. Cody's The Real Champ❤
I just came to this video just to dislike it.
Roman Reigns wins title but cody wins our heart.... ❤❤
Truth Is roman is the only superstat left in wwe. The face the tribal Chief The Protector of WWE
Who is except Roman best
This is not cody movent it's one only Roman movent this is osm for Roman winning matches 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Roman always wins cheat!!
In India, Roman Reigns is as famous among kids and youth as Undertaker was when we were kids... Acknowledge the Trible Chief🔥🔥🔥
Honestly this match was fireeee, ofc the end hurt.
The whole tribal chief thing is Cringe.

Bed Highlights
Roman Reigns vale like kro
Cheater saala... 😂😂
Jjnnmmbmnb
Thank god that jabroni like drumstick jobber Rhode aka former aew guy aka star dust didn't end the greatest heel run of all time..
I really wanted cody to win this one 😔
Roman can't win matches on his own now!!!! SHAME!!!
John Cena and Cody my favorite 😍😍😍😍
It's nice to see how cody rhodes giving his belt to luke harper's son ❤❤❤    RIP Luke Harper
day 2 sucked
Roman needed his whole entire family to beat cody, that just shows roman cant do anything by hiself
Roman
Cody vs Roman at Summer Slam *Cody Rhodes wins! 🙌🏻🏆*
Bloodline cheating line😤😤
why, why why, why even have him return if he’s not going to get it all. i’m sorry cody. they don’t fw you
I am happy that Roman Won... Now we could see his 1000 days reign celebration 🥹🥹
Actually Fans And WWE And Cody All Know that Roman Reigns Gets Win So They Think Not To Show Full Fight 🤣🤣🤣🤣 ☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️

X-Pac heat
Roman Reigns will be an  cheater forever..😠😠🤬
Cody Rhodes Rules !
I’m so sad  I’m so sad and disappointed  But roman never wins by him self  and I’m sick of romans really
Acknowledge our Tribal Chief ☝️ Head of the Table
The only good vince is a dead vince.
We are tired of Roman reigns
Aquaman vs Homelander 🔥🔥
I love the old roman reinge the big dog
To me this looks like WWE wanted the cake and eat it too. Have Roman go to 1000 days and still have Cody look credible. But it was just too overbooked.....match was still good but the finish was a mess imo
Yes roman won☺☺☺
Knowledge me 🤪❤
What kinds highlights was this lol
This match was the right of cody ... But with the entrance of solo sikoa...cody has lost...this is not the rules of he match... We say to HHH CEO of wwe to rematch both of them.... No one will be on ring side.... Including sikoa, paul hymen,, as well as the usos....

Roman Rains a vergogna del wrestler
Wwe must  give 1 title run to Cody Rhodes❤. He deserved it. Wwe is so unfair & this sorts of storyline sucks 🖕 No more interrsted for this sorts of business 😢
This broke my heart
Acknowledge my Tribal Chief Roman Reigns ☝️
Suprise suprise Roman wins with outside interference from bloodline yet again.   The storyline is making this dude look like the most incapable human being in earth lmao
The roman 👑👑👑👑👑 king is back 😈😈😈😈😈
Roman Reigns ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Damm HHH
Who is the one standing with roman and Paul ? Can u pls tell
I think only Randy Orton can defeat Roman.. and I'm waiting for that moment
Roman vs RKO.@ backlash dream match
I think there are going to make this match happen again in the next WrestleMania and that time Cody will win like John Cena did against rock
Roman Reigns must have pics of someone to always get over. They ruined this match. Can't be bothered watching wrestling anymore. It sux
WWE is scripted, that's not a problem. The problem is their performance looks scripted. In the attitude Era you could not have told the match moves are scripted because it was so well planned and acted but not the same case anymore.
This video has more than 60000 dislikes!
Roman❤️❤️ acknowledge me
I don't like Roman Reigns anymore.   I hope Cody Rhodes win the title belt at the next pay-per-view.  Nobody's help I hope this time is going to be in a steel cage.     This time he won't be able to run each other's backs anymore.
American Dream was not complete 😭
Wwe suck 👎🏻 . Wwe universe wants Cody or brock as a new wwe undisputed universal champion.
"he's ready to be beaten"   -paul heyman 😂😂😂
Is Cody a brother of Lana Rhoades 🥲
Acknowledge him 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Roman Reigns 💀💀💀💀
Ohh undertaker
This is Roman Reing👿👽
We’re getting Rhodes vs Cody 2 at wmxl
The fact that people actually expected that the dude who started AEW to end the most badass, dominant and historic reign of this generation, that also after winning royal rumble by entering in no.30💀
namaste America🙏
He’ll get a rematch for sure but still this was messed up how it ended 🤦🏾‍♂️
This wrestlemania was the best in last ten years and this result was the worst of it. Cody should have won it. Roman is a relative of the Rock but not the Rock. He is boring.
Wwe more n more push reigns
Why this WWE industry uploads video after wrestle mania why not before wrestlemania
Codys a good man great at promos. Just dont seeing him  be able to defend any chamionship against some of the bigger stronger men in wwe.
Roman Reigns always playing in cheating matches
Actually winner Cody Rhodes.
Roman longer time undisputed champion 🏆
I think their overselling Roman they should’ve gave Cody the title it’s time for a fresh face
1000 days loading..I guess
I acknowledge my trible chief
I've been out of the loop. Can anyone please update me why Cody stopped being Stardust and how come he got this opportunity to fight with Roman for the championship
Totally Disappointment match
Number1 hell
Why Heyman's expression is always like that🤣🤣🤣🤣 he is the funniest lol
Its All Fake It's All Waste 🤧
wwe should have let the balls slide in Cody yards this was the best time to do things 😶
Cody is the real winner . Roman wins just because of usos and solo . Roman is a cheater
They may as well fire Cody. Even if they rematch at WM 40 and Cody wins, it won't be anywhere NEAR as special as if he'd won tonight. This wasn't as shocking as That HORRIBLE Thing That Happened at WM 30, but it was CLOSE.
I'm really happy that tribal chief Roman Reigns win this match because someone from aew come and defeat 2 years straight domination of Roman reigns in one match 😂😂
wwe should not promote roman now. it’s irritating now. enough is enough
BOYCOTT.
Roman is many many times cheating Roman is boring parsons please change the winner codi deserve a title so please change the next winner
At this moment, this video has over 59K dislikes.
Aew aew aew aew aew rocks
I expected this Cody is not pure wwe and Vince is the head of the company definitely he won't be the undisputed champion which is why impossible
Cody long time no see

Roman Empire 🥰☝️
Eat sleep cheat and repeat tribal cheat
පම්ක තමා
Brock Lesnar vs Solo Sikova ( he still not ready yet 😅 )🔥🔥🔥  We need this MATCH!!!
At the very beginning we all knew Cody fookin Rhodes would loose🖕😂😂😂😂😂😂 why the match happens😂 No use Roman have already beaten Better Stars than Cody 😂😂
Roman mine favorite wrestler
interference, incapacitated referee, same setup…different PLE. 🙃
Roman 👎 over boring
I'm disappointed by Triple H.
Cody's is 🔥
So this is what he left AEW for? Lol
can we have the full match please?
Yall really thought they would let an AEW original dethrone they're golden child?
I should have known they would have had such a stupid ending to the Roman Cody match Ihave really learned to expect stupid from WWE anymore
🍑🔥🍑🔥🍑
He deserved wins. Damn it!
Incredible Match 🔥🔥
59k dislikes.  That's more dislikes than the Seth Rollins stoppage at Hell in a Cell 😬
Cody deserves to win
Come, you know it was going to end like that. I don't let my kids, nephews, nieces, etc watch wrestling anymore since they started cheating at games at home and at school saying, that's the only way to win.  They looked up to champion wrestlers saying, look at Roman Reigns, Auston Theory, Baylee, etc.  Reigns is not the greatest champion there ever was. In Baseball, football, boxing, basketball, wrestling, bowling, tennis, etc. all have champions, but only one champion is a bad role model to our children, only one champion can't win without help from cheaters.  WWE is a joke now and will continue to be until they do at least one thing.  Make all championship matches the rule is whoever wins is the champion.  If you get disqualified, the title goes to the winner.  Same as in all other sports including boxing.  The champions are supposed to represent the organization they are champions in, not make the company look bad.  I wonder home much WWE cheats venues out of their money by short-changing them.  I've taken our kids to their last WWE event and pushing for school district to disallow any WWE content in schools.
59k plus dislikes..F you WWE 🤌🏻
The plot armour is crazy
I'm so pissed that Cody didn't win. I'm so sick of Roman reigns as champion. I'm absolutely disgusted by the finish and decision to keep the titles on Roman. Absolute bullcrap
Cody got his reward on raw 😂😂
Cody won
Roman best
Cody shows up everyday, wrestles no matter what(even with a torn pec) risking his life just to put up a show for fans. Roman barely shows up doesn't wrestle and he gets to win. Wow, it couldn't had gotten worse.
Como odio el linage 😡😡😡👎👎🙄🙄
F you WWE 🖕🏻
It's like wrestling is resetting
Roman Reigns third class player.

WWE is not an Wrestling institution... It's an emotion 🔥🔥
Cody entrance looks like homelander
Win in roman
Roman Reigns 💓 hai bhai hai
Y’all keep complaining about Roman not winning matches on his own like wtf y’all want him to just squash wrestlers in every match ? No! He’s doing great storytelling! He was gonna win regardless. It’s scripted. He makes it seem like he needs help to win matches to make his opponents seem strong! He’s doing them a favor. He could be squashing these dudes in these matches but instead he’s making them look good ! And y’all got the nerves to boo Roman like he ain’t the far best thing in that company!! If he leaves , WWE gone be damn near unwatchable!!
Tribel cheef🔥
always universal champ
Real winner is   cody... ⚡👿
I love Roman Reigns.but he as not game play after he as game play
How much push roman needs literally amaze how long this gonna happen from last 5-7 years he is unbeatable its ultimately ruining the biggest element of wwe success the "shockers" almost everybody knows whenever he is entering the ring he is gonna win no offence ti roman fans he himself also a best what wwe got now but its no more intresting
Roman like cheater i hate u Roman👎👎👎👎👎
Cody is king ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
look At 5:30 guys, how it's so fake 🤣🤣, I mean how . WWE my childhood was a lie 🥲🥲🥲
It's all about roman reigns being champion for 1000+ days
3helluva kicks and stunner and last 2 cross roads but head of the table 🔥
BLOODLINE FOREVER
No use of Royal rumble when every winner of royal rumble has to lose to reigns at wrestlemania!!!
We are bored to see Roman reign still holding on those tittles
Roman's going for the Women's title now kkk
I told u it was going to be tribal cheifs moment athe grandest stage
Totally fake time West show
Forever Roman
The historic Reign of Roman Reigns continues
Thousand crores turnover. But their is no proper script.  You need to change the script writers
Welcome WWE shocking fight fighting Goli
☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝only roman
Everyone wanted Cody to lose and now everyone’s crying cause he lost 😂 absolute morons
yaar iss match me Cody jitna chahiye tha , kya yar Roman hamesha aaise hi dusro ke help se jitata rahai to bohot boring lagta hai
This was beyond stupid. This should’ve been the blowoff to the bloodline, like Goldberg beating Hogan should’ve ended the NWO. This was it. Done.
lol they will never give that poor dude a world title this was the night to freaking do it
Roman una maldita rataa xd
No matter...Roman Reign is my favourite☝☝☝
number #3 in trending in the Dominican Republic 😨😨
Como e la mejor lucha del mundo
Head of the table ☝
Cody Deserve to win 🥺❤️‍🔥
WWE king roman 🎉🎉🎉❤
This was the moment for Cody to won the belt. Even if Roman lost, it wouldn't impact anything since he's been the champion so long.
Roman in always ultimate.......😈
Acknowledge you tribel chief 😊❤❤❤
Greatest ending to any WM in a looong time. 😂😂
😅😅😅 ... Fake sport.
Man, I wish he would’ve won. Dude definitely deserves that belt.
No dq match would really suit them but yeah even tho Cody might not admit it but let’s face it even if he does win it in the future it will be no where near as good as it would of been if he won it there
There is only one Cody Rhodes. And there are many Roman Reigns. I don't know which Roman Reigns is the actual Champion
Acknowledge tribal chief 🎉
Why are you so hype with this scripted act?
I hate it here.
they ruined a big upset moment that would have been a huge pop for Cody but typical of WWE to let the fans down
4 vs cody rhodes🥲
Im just sick about the demon 👿 I need more of that character.
Congratulation Roman Reigns
Dude Roman has been champ for long enough
Roman ❤
5star
Roman is a chicken
I m quit watching from wwe.... booring
Ruined it
I'm literally "tired" of outside interference in Roman's matches; they have to have him loose these titles, it's getting ridiculous, how many times is he going to retain because of "someone else"......🤦🏾‍♂️   I think the fans are tired of it as well.🙁
Now Brock is going to be a partner of Cody Rhodes in tag team match against Roman Reigns for the title ⚡💢🌟🔺🔻
It was because of the 💩 Solo Sikoa
You treated like the end of world
Ruining all the talented wrestlers overrated roman reigns rediculous
oh! can I see the Roman Reign's fans👆👆
What the hell you have done wwe so disappointing
Once again he proved    Roman is a fake  winner
Roman the king 🤴🤴 I acknowledge him ☝☝
Cody is wrestlermania
REMEMBER WRESTLEMANIA 2018😓😓
They ruined what could have been the Wrestling moment of the decade. LITERALLY FUMBLED THE BAG SO HARD like I’m over WWE,  nowadays all they do is the same thing over and over again. Same matches. Same story line just w different people. Same moves, same promos. Cody was the shot at fixing the company and they just ruined the best push possible
I will give benefit of doubt to wwe, but idk if wwe will able to make this perfect opportunity again, only thing I see them doing is Roman Vs Joe for full circle but that would be waste if they make Joe of all people beat Roman after Roman beat all these people day after day, event after event
Once cheater always a cheater Roman 😂😂😂
Real winner cody
Maybe Cody will finally accept his fate of working Corbin and Miz in the midcard. Just because you say you're the best doesn't mean you are.
What a dissapointment. This match had clear story of Codys legacy. The whole father angle screamed win. What a dissrespect. Who else had better story to beat Roman than returning midcard wrestler turned star ?
Wwe has fooled many. Ruined my childhood 😅
Wrest so boring no u can literally predict every outcome what’s the point of even watching
Just the fact that Roman needed to cheat to win that makes me disgusted in him. Cody has more potential than almost every other Wwe superstar.
Roman Reigns Gear Was So Clean Should Wear The Red More
Great match. Terrible ending.
ROMAN  REIGNS
what type is wresling did u have!? shame on you👎👎👎
Can’t believe usos lost😢😢😢
Roman reigns have to lose
That samoan spike from solo zikioa finished the story 💔😑
I might be wrong but didn't Roman Reigns have help (cheated) on everyone of his title defenses? Tainted victories
I’m really glad I didn’t waste money on watching this trash ppv. Terrible creative… Such a shame.
Roman and Cody rematch
A champ to need help to win is a fake
Roman is the rock..  Love from India ❤❤
roman god
Roman is not perfect winner
Worst decision WWE has ever made😕😕
This was choreographed perfectly
The villain ❤❤Roman
Did Roman win
Wird immer lächerlicher
Getting tired of Roman wining
Roman reigns ❤🤴
It is only Rock who can beat roman
Please upload full match
So much about Cody Rhodes but he's not ready. He's overhyped
wwe is very predictable with their roman reigns matches, he kicks out of like 15 signature moves, then beats the opponent in 2 signatures. but yet they always find a way to make it a great match every single time.
Ok. I love Roman, but ya not going to continue this bulls🤬 with hyping up stars for weeks & then f🤬 them over when is there time to shyne! Switch this s🤬 up asap! Reigns need to get dethrone now!
Without the bloodline roman IS nothing
It Cody moment but Roman ke chakkar me ye kya kar diya wwe ne
This is beyond boring and stagnant.  roman reigns and uso story line needs to end and loose titles.    This is beyond boring . There is no way in hell reigns and the uso's are the best wrestlers of all time refusing to let anyone else win.
Roman reign king the best
What's wild is how although Cody KNOWS he's not going over before he even walks to the ring and the finish is already decided, yet he still put on the character, gave it his all, and made us absolutely think he was going to win. It's gotta be discouraging to an extent, but the ability for a wrestler/performer to navigate that professionally separates the good from the GREAT. Co-Dawg is all heart and he'll be world champion by this time next year..
For those who think cody should have won, After solo interfered, Roman immediately got back up after cody hit him with two cross rhodes. He was gonna kick out regardless
Roman is the loser 👎👎👎 ? Kodi roses u r winner 🏆🫥🏆🫥🏆🫥🏆🏆🏆🏆
RR
Roman always cheating
Let him cook
Whoever booked this succeded at pissing the fans off
Roman👎🏻
Roman reigns cheated to win
@Nor Van You're absolutely right. I'm not surprised Roman got the W, but it's gonna be hard for Cody to bounce back and create the genius of his incredible story again..
WWE has always been, and will always be political. It don’t matter how over you are, you can’t just help start a rival promotion, then win the big one at the main event of Wrestlemania. Don’t be surprised if Cody never wins the belt.
Cody was robbed,  he deserves to break the streak,  he was supposed to win that
Cody Rhodes looking like a Walmart home lander lol
They said Romans opponent next year will be Lukemisha. We all know who is winning that one, sorry not sorry but you’re battle is over next year in Philly
Good thing roman retained it would of been dumb to give it to Cody just like 3 months after he returned
Roman forever
Roman camt fight him self
looking back, I get it. why reigns retained. the story needs to continues
Cody looks like Zeus the mythical God please let him win the rematch Because I ain't going to lie that entrance dope as f
How could they not pull the trigger? It was Cody’s time & moment, the right place to do it..
You all think triple h would let a guy ( Cody Rhodes) who just came back from a rival company and Cody who was talking smack  about wwe while he was with aew would just go to WrestleMania and win the world titles against roman reigns in WrestleMania lol no way in hell baby.
Time to unfollow Corrupted Champions WWE
Roman and the cousin's suck they cheat all the way 🖕👇👎
No way wwe made starrcade 1997 all over again 😭😭
WWE dropped the ball on this one.  Cody should have gone over and beaten Roman, it's overdue.  Also, Asuka should have beaten Bianca, she's a nothing champion.  Best decision was Kevin and Sami going over for the tag team belts.
I was so happy the ref sent Solo out. I knew the Usos would interfere, and that Sami and Kevin would handle them. I couldn't have predicted Solo just coming back after getting ejected. I really, truly believed Cody had this one. They need a stipulation that doesn't allow the Bloodline anywhere near the ring. Damn near every title defense Roman has had he would have lost had the Bloodline not been there.
Make a movie with Roman and The Usos and let Cody win the rematch because as a Black person I always want us to win but I love All people I think Cody deserves to win the rematch Plus dude character looks dope as f
Bloodline ☝🏻
Really? Only two spears to down Cody? This is not how you can become champion 😊
What a crock
Shame on you Cody. How you spoke to Roman before Wrestlemania. Asif you are going to rule the world. A Roman with no Reigns, A Chief with no Tribe Haha...Did you remember how Roman told you? Acknowledge him.
Roman reigns ❤😊
It’s time to forget wwe..
I think,that roman and cody story just started,they made roman win wrestlemania to let him co.plete his 1000 days strrak Further,speaking,its very common in wwe that a wrestler looses to a champion but later on wins it in few months Maybe cody will win it at summerslam And since,Cody's story needs to be expanded, He only appeared in royalrumber and few 2-3 matches,his story need to be build more beautifully,so that later when he wins it, I'll be more impactfil(about a wrestler who first lost,but then conquered the championship) Also i feel, they could now set a t three man tag team match between samy,KO  cody vs roman and usos  So everyone relax, there's so much more toh come,
I actually want Cody to win because The Usos lost but now I want Jey to win the undisputed champion from roman because jimmy and Jey made roman who he is so I want Solo, jimmy, Jey to challenge roman because I'm good with them losing the tag team champs but now I want them to actually jump Roman
This was so unfair. They need to have a match with no other wrestlers aloud ringside
Most people who support Cody Rhodes might be American. But the World Support Roman Reigns. Love you Roman from World Second highest population country. Apart from American All the world Supports you. Just see K.O finishing Moves and Sami Zayn Finishing Moves. But still he defend his title ❤❤❤❤
I'm from Bangladesh I love Cody Rhodes ❤😢😢
Cody will be back but Roman is literally the goat idk what to say
Poor edit
roman raigns is trash cody rhodes is the best😀
Cody is a sell out🎉
Chetr romen
BOTCHED FINISH
Cody all the way.. What a wrestler you are
Roman ❤😂🎉😢😮😅😊
It was codys moment, already bored with Romans winning against every RR winner
People expected cody to win after the USO's lost? 💀 Imagine
🎉🎉🎉
Once again. It takes all four of them to beat one man. The story line of Roman only defending a title now and then that he would have lost 10 times without help from his servants is dying fast.  Yeah I said that
I kinda love Roman, but its hard to accept an ending as cheap as that one, even as a fan... i can see why people say they “grow” out of wrestling lol
bro roman needs his minions to save every match for him, if it wasnt for the usos and solo he wouldve lost it ages ago
Cody deserves to win he was better but we know it's just acting they already decided who should win 🤦🏼
Cry. Whine.  Complain. Acknowledge him!
Worst match of wrestlemania 39. I nearly cried. We got to be honest Roman reigns would be nothing without The Bloodline
Give us some credit... WHO in their right mind would wrestle Omos... they must pay the challenger big bucks to take the whipping the Giant puts on his opponent????
Roman reigns 🏆 ✌ 💪 🏆 ✌ 💪 ❤❤❤
WWE got it wrong this time. Cody is the champion in my mind. Well done champ you finished the story by showing us how far you've come and inspiring us.
We need a new champion
Missing Roman Reigns entry 🥺🥺🥺
Cody is still a kid to beat the undisputed WWE Universal Champion. I thought of not to watch WWE ever again if Cody beats Roman Reigns. But it still gives me time to watch. All time favourite Roman. You look Manly. You look awesome. Train yourself more better for the upcoming challengers. Untill and unless you get old. Never ever give your title to someone else. Love you all the Bloodline. Brother in Christ. ❤ Cody is an American Nightmare. Roman is the Reigns of Universe.
5:25 WTF AWESOME MOMENT 😱😱😱😱  UUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH
I still can't believe people thought cody was actually gonna win
Reins wins again 😑😑😑
Cody real hero
Wwe ia so stupid ...they can't see people wanted cody rhodes to win bit as usual poor wwe blew this jacpot opportunity...
Damn 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Roman most cheater wwe 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
🙄
Biggest disappointment of the HHH era.
Idk I think Cody go win it the raw after mania !👀 … they had Roman win again 🔥🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mtwss what is this 👺
I would like to see Roman reigns try to win without jimmy and jay Uso solo Sakura, and fat face Paul. Ban then from ring side and see who wins
Go on Roman win❤❤
Bad story man. Roman should have beat him without any help from the gang. He can do it alone. He beat undertaker without any help. You making us feel like Cody is bigger than brock lesnar and undertaker. Roman deserves the win but a clean win.
I hate wwe i dont want to wacth again
The fact Cody flipped Roman Reigns in front of his daughter is a legendary moment for the Cody family.
Oh you didn't know!!!???!! Years ago after Superstar Billy Graham defeated Dusty Rhodes in a Steel Cage.  A time later Vince McRipoff Stated, NOBODY WITH THE NAME OF RHODES WILL EVER BE WWWF/WWF/WWE Champion while I'm in power.  Dusty Rhodes cost Vince McRipoff alot of money.  Dusty made the NWA serious competition.
Homelander vs Aquaman
Roman is nothing without the bloodline.
Bien mi gefe teibal
If Reigns want to be acknowledged,  he needs to prove he can win without help from his cousins. Hate the phony champion.
Sabia k roman no hiva perder😂😂😊
I don't Like this match Because Cody Rhodes is Win WRESTLEMANIA  moments History... Roman Always Cheating ****
Era tanto el miedo que le tenía el inflado de Román , a Cody, que puso de acuerdo a sus primos para que le ayudarán
Epic fail at 5:28. Cody breaks the pin before Roman kicks out. Idk why but this was like a stain on the entire match for me.
Same old script, cheat cheat cheat, and the dumb refs who loses focus easily, it’s funny and not getting funny any longer, we are tired of seeing the same face with the titles and always cheating and asking us to acknowledge him, it’s boring.
WE THE ONES ☝️CODY 🚮.
I acknowledge you my tribal chief ☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾
Está pelea debería de realizar en una gaula de acero por qué estuvo muy desigual y mucha trampa
I don't like this How?
Anxious about what comes next...👀
Coward roman,roman retire
All those people should've asked for their money back
يارب ترزق الي يتابعني فرحه يسجد لها باكيا 💕😊
well who is left then???
Your highlights were superb on my childhood..now it is worse
Am so tired of roman reing and the Usos they never win a fear fight
Roman is low key lovin those Astro Boy Boots.
Roman is Wrestle Mania
En todos los eventos principales siempre tiene q tener ayuda, a cada rato ya cansa y aburre 😝
Esa lucha mandaba enjaulada ya conocen a Román si no es con ayuda y trampa no gana
Honestly, I'm bored with Roman being the champ right now. They built Samy and Cody. But none of them, it's Roman who is the champ. 🤷🏽‍♂️🤦
The usos are mf
The G.O.A.T 🐐 Roman Reigns......... !!!!
Love how Progressive-woke era WWE, blocks many comments & replies. Entertainment for...Snowflakes
😊
Cody   face say a lot 😮😢 It sad last night  Cody  was  ready to be  WWE  Champion.
Roman is a big chiter
Roman a coward wwe champion
Roman 👎 👎 👎
No inferring  in the rematch wwe if they do Cody will win
Sign mjf before wrestlmania 40 and have him beat roman
Even just watching it you can feel the wwe fans wanted a new wwe champion 😮
Ganale Román reingz confío en ti Cody es una basura
Why HHH it was cody's moment cody's time ..why 😢😢  cody deserve to win
Cody needs to win his second royal rumble in 2024 beat Roman reigns at wrestlemania 40 just like John Cena beat The Rock at wrestlemania 29
Cody has been active since the day he came back and has faced anyone in his way. Including defeating Solo. What has Roman done except sit around and cheat to win?
I left watching wrestling because this is not a good game like how the Usos came in this big fight and the referee even doesn't know what is happening in the ring. Waste of time Bye
Yeah reins have reined to long becoming a yawn !!!
WWE is stupid after fumbling this one. What a bone headed decision. There can be a story left to be told but this is like going to Wrestlemania and putting over Shawn Michaels over Austin. Just a stupid, stupid decision.
So much for ,"We believe the crowd should go home happy "
They wasn’t letting the AEW start beat their made hero reigns  Cody will have go lil longer being punished before he gets his run with title
big RESPECT earned by cody
I will never be happy even if Cody wins the belt after Roman reached the 1,000 days as champion. For me, i think there's no place he should win than Wrestlemania and have that Wrestlemania moment 😭 I mean c'mon, he left AEW just to be on the list of Roman's victims?
Well the only explanation is they want roman to have one more wrestle mania win before he goes to hollywood. That or he aint getting any movies. So they can extend the reign even more. But manly because backlash is a thing. If it wasnt for WMbacklash. This would have been cody moment. But at backlash. He will get those title wins. Reigns can smash him at WRESTLE MANAI. Another reason is that rock will not be able to make it at backlash if cody had won. Reigns would have drop the title if the rock faces reigns. But he didnt show up this year. So roman can extend his title reign till backlash or longer. If he cant get any movies to do. OR UNLESS THE ROCK WANTS ANOTHER TITLE RUN TO FACE REIGNS AT BACKLASH. IT BEING BETTER IN PAPER. THATS ANOTHER OPTION TOO.
truely without usos,roman is nothing
I mean you can see the faces of the fans after the match, we all really thought this was Cody’s time to end Roman’s streak
So satisfying to see the villain win and crushes everyone hearts. 😂😂😂😂
Roman rejngd quá tệ
Dam it I swear I wish I had at least 20 years on my life I would have beat the hell out Roman reigns myself this solid 215 frame that hits like Tyson would bust him up for sure
@WWE is spoiling wrestlemania with these type of matches , all the other matches were fantastic , usos vs ko & Sammy , bianca vs asuka , flair vs Ria but with Roman it had to be an imbalanced match (as usual) . Otherwise it would have been a cracker of a match worthy of wrestlemania main event  had it been one on one but as it was it was totally ruined and ruining the wrestlemania climax . why ???
Cody went aew and  trash talk wwe..Now he left aew join wwe..How he deserve  title very soon..What abt other wrestlers  who work hard in wwe..
For those who says Cody should won  champtionship right but what about brock orton that freaking guy monster they are more deserving than him
the final result was unfair to be honest
Why people keep saying “Cody deserved to win”. News flash: you have to earn your way to the top. Allow me to remind everyone, this Cody guy, he left WWE and y’all think he was gonna get the W cause Dusty’s son? Hell naw. He needs to climb back. How do you have hunk the rest of the locker room will feel if they all get skipped for someone who just arrived?
This ending left me feeling hollow if I'm being honest. The obsession this company has with reaching milestones and breaking records is ridiculous at this point. They keep sacrificing star making moments just for a number.
Paul Heyman. He's at WrestleMania 39 no doubt
the amount of dislikes in this video
They’ve built Roman up and need to take him down. I don’t care for Cody so much but he deserved to win. I’m tired of seeing all of the superstars who have to work their way up, get shoved to the bottom and then they have idiots like Logan Paul come in and get these big matches. It’s a joke💯
They called it the Universal title only in the title of the video, and not the Undisputed WWE Universal title 🤔
I watched all of wrestemania last night. then fell asleep after these guys entrances. That ramp was sooooo long lol
First drew got his moment stolen, and now Cody, he about to go back to Aew
Sad. But I guess you can’t make the entire bloodline lose their titles over one weekend. Seems like they’re going with the implosion of the stable first before Cody gets his moment
What can we say... It's just that Roman Sucks  big time
Anybody just sick and freakin tired of Roman Reigns????! Roman had to cheat like always and Cody got robbed but I'm do think that there will be another story line because Cody will not quit and I hope he don't I hope Cody gets his well over due championship
Roman Reigns will lose to Bad Bunny @ Backlash in Puerto Rico. This was the plan from the beginning. You will see…
Boo Cody should have won  by far bro this made WrestleMania from a 9/10 to a 6/10
Another f'ing dissapointment
Worst main event ever people's are sick and tired of tribal cheif gimmick how long we see the title change in WrestleMania main event where is WWE 's creative team
The story is finished. B+ Player
Boooo
Bulshit
Two words. Summer Slam.
Pretty easy to win when it's 4 on 1.
Classic match. They made the right decision
I'm glad they went this route. Everything seemed to predictable from RR up until The actual finish...Roman said he's cheffing up Filot Mignon not McDonald's. Cody will win it
Pelea conmigo 😭 jajaja 😂
Roman reigns will be the champion forever??? Soo poor , it was a perfect moment for cody
So predictable that it's lame and boring I definitely don't watch as much as I use to...Cody winning would of made it a better
If not cody than who? Who? Who? Who? 🤷🏻‍♂️
0:22 Was Sureal!
😢 sometym ihate wwe why doing this for cody someone cheat and still the Champion 😮
Roman Reigns is unstoppable
Cody winning would have been a memorable moment but for the long term story they had to stick with Roman as champ, the Bloodline is the best story in WWE and you can create more huge matches with them. At the time I thought drew should have won in Cardiff but it was the right decision for Roman to win then and it still is now
What a fix roman won yeah right what has he got over vince this is such a rip off if people believe  roman is good wrestler he's not I feel sorry for the other wrestlers they know it is fixed for roman to win thank goodness for YouTube  where I can watch real wrestlers ENGLISH WRESTLERS BIG DADDY GIANT HAYSTSCKS THEY DIDNT NEED FAMILY TO HELP THEM WIN OR THE FACT THEY ARE NOT UP THE BISSES ARSE LIKE ROMANS XXX
It’s going to be like how they did evolution they are going to make solo sikoa the one to beat Roman just like Batista and triple H
Roman….the only “champion” who has never won on his own
Roman not deserve that tittle he is not win any match without cheating he is a big cheater loser roman bycot💪
I am loving the storytelling.
Cody was robbed of a moment he more than deserved. It just all made sense.
Pero que M de robo ya me tienen podrido con su jefe tribal 💩
roman reigns kickouts are tooo close 2.9999999 agree everyone????
We all know WWE dropped the ball REALLY hard on that one. Cody had THE BUILDUP to be the champion.
This happened to Ronda too
Brock Lesnar never needed help to win, he never needed paul H. To even come up to the ropes!!!😂😂😂😂 Roman you suck!!!
Cody was never ready for this momment. He doesn't bring nothing to the table! All he says is...what do you want to talk about?😂😂😂
It was very bad decision 😞😞😞
He cant even face CODY one on one 🤷🏼‍♂️
Cody put up a hell of a fight bro, the title was his, his moment, his win, but Roman reigns got help again :/
Witnessed this in person. I peaked lol
I thought they gonna send the yt like in 2025 or 2024 NOT A DAY AFTER WRESTLEMANIA WHEN I SAW THIS I WAS HYPED!
That finish was so awful. Like the shock idea of Roman retaining isn’t bad… having Solo come back attack Cody and that’s how Roman wins is dreadful booking for a wm main event… like just have Roman win clean??
本気で殴ってないし、蹴ってないが…頑張ってますね
Roman can’t fight his own battles he keeps winning because of the bloodline helps him win. Cody would have won that if Roman fought his own battles.
I thought he said he’d go all out with the fireworks?
Wwe is never gonna let roman lose always has outside interference its getting old same champion for this long is ridiculous and makes it hard to watch when roman has a match we all know what the outcome is gonna be
Cody should of won he would’ve been the best champion
That was actually a shock WWE made Usos lose there tag titles to get people to think Cody would win the world titles
Roman Reigns feels like it's this generations Triple H reign of terror.
FU Vince… your empire is about to crumble. I think people are starving for the territories once again. Tony concha capitalize on this blunder of Vince and Mr. Stephanie McMahon.
Tell me Vince is back without telling me Vince is back. Hugely missed opportunity here. Huge botch. Getting boring now.
Absolute travesty
I'm so bored with this senario
Hated the ending to this match. Roman should’ve lost the title a long time ago. It was Cody’s time
Roman <3
And yes I understand Cody and him are the same age but still why not replace Roman now? It's a good time to replace him. He could retire come back baby face. Everybody would get behind him as a babyface now cuz he's so dominant as a heel. Even people that didn't like him would like them
Mmm the fact this turns out like it did is either bad writing. Or a setup to get the title belt while pushing Solo out of the bloodline.
Roman is the best ever 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
You're going to have to eventually replace Roman. I hope triple h knows that you're going to have to replace them. You can't just keep relying on Roman every time even though he draws money, he's going to get older and get more brittle
Right decision. Roman hits 1000 days, Cody rebuilds. Either Jey or Cody knock him off at Summerslam. Everyone acting like Cody was buried 😅. Let him rebuild and tell more story, he is going to be champion. Maybe Summerslam or next Wrestlemania.
buuuuuuuuuuu
Roman reigns vs kenny omega is the one
All I can hope from this loss is that triple h can push him even as a bigger star coming from a loss from Roman and then coming beating him right at a thousand days and I believe there's a pay-per-view close to a thousand days
WWE: Just like Daniel Bryan, this was Cody’s time. You ruined this. Roman is not the champion.   So many of us are done with WWE, and this is why!
To Be Continued.
I'm lovin every second of roman's heel run man it's perfect
At this point it is exhausting for fans to have to see Roman reigns not win on his own once again
1)@Awaz E Haq Live Channel for Hinduism & Atheism 2)@Sam Stallone Channel for Hinduism & Christianity  3)@Qaiser Ahmed Raja Channel for Atheism & Agnosticism 4)@Awakening Channel for Hinduism 04.04.2023
I will acknowledge Roman reigns if he beat Randy Orton
Cody is the winner Period.
wwe is absolutely horrible these days
Fu
Roman is the GOAT 🐐
Cody should have won
Cody man
Cody is the undisputed wee universal 🏆 not the stupid chief Cody is the winner not the cheaters fire roman or make him lose once plsss and make someone take the titles away from him plssssss ❤
People keep on bragging that cody should've won. Hahaha. Why would you exchange someone who's being the face of the company and have a great storyline. Cody wil be booed sooner or later roman retaining was the right thing to do
Wwe missing a huge opportunity with the typical story line
This will forever be one of the biggest mistakes in WWE history… you don’t have Cody lose after all that hype and momentum
Cody, Drew, and Sami. All white hot, and all sat down. I hope that’ll be a driving point in the future.
Scripted endind
It was supposed to be Cody's time, but Triple H never forgets. 😢
No Roman reigns has been holding on it for to long now jey uso needs to beat him
Lmfao Roman got help to win this match while Cody did it all on his own! Cody should have won that fight and almost did if it wasn’t for Roman’s family who kept doing cheap shots and sneak attacking. That definitely wasn’t a fair match.. to bad they don’t do rematches.
He will have the titles for probably about three more years
Say what you want about WWE, Roman Reigns is the best champion and no other star comes close. Cody’s “story” being a decent lead up to Wrestlemania, but I wouldn’t even put Cody in top 5 wrestlers in WWE. Reigns, Brock, Orton, Edge, even Seth Rollins, and a couple of others rank higher than Cody. Not to mention Cody couldn’t even win the belt in AEW.
Roman the biggest garbage of all time has ever been able to alone
Cody coming back just u wait it's not over
Nah why they do Cody like that…
Cody isn't the kind of huge wrestler who can be given a Great Roman Chain break, a chain break from a great wrestler like Randy or sheamus
How stupid and boring is it to have the same guy be champion when performers like Undertaker Kane The Rock Stone Cold and others to name just a few that were twice the entertainers that Roman Reigns is or anybody in that locker room right now. And we're talking duration time didn't get to hold titles that long. No shade on Roman Reigns because he's probably the only one that could have wrestled back with them guys and made it but he does not hold a candle to any of those men YET.
ياخيي لو كودي يكسر السلسلة احسن
Never been one of my favs. but I think Cody should have won. By the way I'm glad Sami and Kevin won the titles from the Usos.
Oh completely forgot it was wrestlemania this week.
One of the most worst wrestlers of all time, he can't have a great match by himself and always gets carried by his opponents, and yet, he's holding all the belts hostage, one for three years and one for one year, he buries everyone he faces and devalues the belts by never really being a fighting champion, just a weak one with his lackeys doing stuff for him. he sucks 😔
How stupid of me thinking it was the last time I was gonna throw this "☝🏼" 😂
Damn wrestling sucks nowadays. 😂
roman es el mejor , esta en la historia de la wwe y sigue el numero 1
effin champion roman cannot even win without his piggies - pathetic  WWE has ruined not only cody's dream but each and every out there
When Roman will fight clean without helps??
Wwe being sold to endeavor the same company that owns ufc this is triple h big announcement that will open raw
Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤ Roman
You all should knows WWE wrestling is scripted and fake.  The reasons why Roman Reign keeps winning matches is because WWE wants him carrying the name, the champion.  Wrestlemania title matches should never be  allows intentional interfered in the ring, Solo, the Uso doing the sneak attack is totally stupid.  I rather prefer to watch matches that the best man wins without outside interfered.  But now a day 99% of adult watching WWE Wrestling acting like kids.  The funny part I often see people writing.  Wow.   This heel that heel.  They got goosebumps etc when they heard music of a certain character entering the area.  These people needs to grow up and acting like a man.   WWE is a show, a entertainment.  It's is scrited and it is fake. Think of it like a stunts man in a movie.  Yes you can get hurts and hurt by accident.   But most of the time everyone will safe and ok.
Wwe is just ruined cody's moment his dream billions of fans dream this is just pathetic
Looks like Roman is not able to do anything without Solo, Jimmy and Jey....lame champion, no reason to be acknowledge....
Worst result
Roman Reign's entrance is like the final boss in a video game
رومان رينزبطل العالم
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Pura trampa.... quien así no gana😢 ya no me está gustando🤦
Cody Will win at summerslam
Cody rose would have won the match if solo didn't interrupt. But I think wwe should rise up to a point where injustice wouldn't be condole. Let any one who interrupt matches be punished severely. I think this will ensure that the right person wins every match
Love you roman reigns and usso and solo
Love you roman reigns
Love you roman reigns
Wtf wwe ??? It was Cody’s time
Best faction of all time 🤷🏾‍♂️💯
Bring back the attitude era
36k likes vs 54k dislikes.  rightfully so
acknowledge the biggest cheater in the world
They got everything right as far as the buildup of this storyline….now I’m just trying to figure out why they would have Cody lose if WM was the perfect place for him to win. It would have meant more for him than Roman, since Roman has already won at WM. I guess we’ll have to wait and see. There must be more to the story.
Roman Reigns is without a doubt the greatest of all time!
WWE Worst Wrestling Entertainment 😂😂😂
Cody should have been undisputed champion
Nooooooo
I think I lost my passion in watching WWE, Call me when this f loses the belt to watch again
Roman is such a disgrace  By letting your brothers to fight for u, cody won everything we need to know
Never watching WWE again they just missed a chance
what a trash ending. end this stupid storyline with roman, its overdone now.
Román the great one ☝️☝️☝️☝️
ECDUBBS!!!!!!! I pray this was our first nod that we're all coming home.
I'm sick of Roman and his family cheating all d time
LETS GO ROMAN Kinda felt bad for Cody tho he got built up to win the title and roman beat him
Im a little disappointed
Hoffe das die wwe verkauft wird !! Cody so schlecht zu verkaufen.. geht gar nicht.
If we could see the dislike count, this video probably will end up being the most disliked video on the channel. More than Charlotte Flair being entered into the Wrestlemania 35 match against Becky Lynch and Ronda Rousey.
If it was a clean win people wouldn’t be as upset, but too many interference killed the mood
The GOAT wins no matter the cost or the price so Acknowledge Him
Even if you want Roman to win, it must be deserved win not getting help by Solo the son of bit**
All y’all said cody😂😂😂😂😂 said Roman was going to win
الله أكبر  سبحان الله الحمد لله لا إله إلا الله استغفر الله العظيم حسبنا الله ونعم الوكيل
wish they had the dislikes visible
"Wooaaahhhhhhhh"❤️ Epic and Crowd was for CODY
NO DOUBT CODY SHOULD HAVE WON❤ Crowd energy for him
Luchas falsas 👎👎👎👎👎
The same upsetting bs at wrestlemania, wwe sell fans a story only to upset them,I don't even want to see raw at this point,wwe hate giving fans what they want
He never stood a chance up agents the tribel chef
Gano con ayuda , no es una pelea , es una mariconada lo que hizo Román, 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
_)_ wwe _)_ wwe _)_ wwe
dooooooooooooogs wwe
6:43 decribes this moment ‘’ Paul you look at Roman a little funny’’- Sami Zayn 2023
NOOOOOOOO
He is paid to loose, wwe didn't want to release Roman.
I always knew it ☝️
Allowing the one dimensional tribal bore to continue as champion tells me that apart from Owen, Zayn, Belair, Flair and Rhea Ripley the WWE has run out of ideas. Their matches were great. Arguably Rousey and Baszler too. The rest are tedious and average, but they had a chance with Rhodes and blew it...and they know it. No amount of hype can make up for such a terrible waste of a good storyline...
Cody should have won, why WWE It was perfect
They need to get better writer's
Like I been saying I'm not surprised at all WWE screwed Cody Rhodes over talking about finish the story but truthfully his story in WWE is mid card next PPV he will b feuding with Jimmy or Jey or Solo an will b the opening act he will never main event again Cody made a stupid mistake listening to WWE an coming back only championships Cody is going to have a chance for is the US title or IC title if WWE could theyd make Cody go for 24/7  truthfully WWE have no respect for Cody or his family if WWE could they'd make him go Stardust again Cody Rhodes made a stupid mistake going back to WWE he will b back as a mid card guy starting tonight on raw he start a feud with Jimmy or Jey or Solo an all 3 of them are just mid carders
Crowd was electrifying during the match but after the match they were so quiet . It tells you the decision was not right.
You could have given Cody the best moment of his career and you didn't by missing out on a sensational opportunity forever. Roman had won 2 main WrestleMania events, he could have lost without problems. Such a pity.
Right decision
People thinking Stardust can beat Roman Reigns 😂😂😂🥱🥱🥱
People don't seem to understand that WWE wants a bad reaction to roman winning because roman is the big bad guy. Eventually something will happen and cody will get his moment again but for now, WWE is doing what they expected to happen
Fans have every right to pissed and i mean it. When i open twitter o boy the hate was off the chart.
I was 11 years old when I started watching WWE and Roman became my hero i never stopped rooting for him just seeing him how far he came is just emotional for me.
I was so disappointed that Hollywood Hulk Hogan didn't show up
Roman Reigns 🔥
I'm going to miss watching WWE this match made me quit it
Que Gran mierda de evento haciendo caer a Cody y siguiendo elevando al bulto Reings
Cody it took 5 men to bring you down we all know that romen cannot win one on one Cody you been F,,,,,
Good match ruined by interference
Cry me a title wave of emotions😭🌊..oh it's Cody's moment it's Cody's moment 🙄Roman won..Get over it..he's a heel that's what heels do..
whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Here me out The legend killer must kill the legendary streak. Have Orton reunite with Cody, edge and Riddle when his suspension is done. That's makes an even 4v4. Then have the uso's and Solo vs Edge, Cody and Riddle in a TLC match or something. And Orton beats Roman in a Street brawl match. Then have Cody win MITB and challenge Orton
Roman deserves this W it ain’t codys time yet
Bet no one here can name a single time Roman has won a match on his own since holding the titles. To be completely honest 1. I believe they are only trying to push him because they hope he will be the next Rock and 2. He just isn’t that good to be as memorable as they want him to be.
Cody deserved this very moment. i have nothing but respect for cody, what a warrior he was in this match.
YES! ROMAN! ACKNOWLEDGE HIM! ☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻
Ya da iras solo asi fulll trampas hasta cuando van a permitir la wwe
Wrestlemania main event: Solo Interferes twice and gets banned from ringside, Jimmy, Jey, Sami, KO get involved but eliminate each other, Solo the returns after being banned to interfere again?? Bro, some booking decisions are just ludicrous
So, another year of cringe wrestling got it
Where is the finish? And you call this a highlight without the finish?
They screwed him
Somehow I think they listened to those wrestling nerds who were complaining that Cody was being given the title too soon. Yeh its gunna be so much better having Cody win the title at Backlash or Summerslam or having to wait a whole nother year for him to win it... 🙄   And who the hell else is Roman going to face now?
How is Roman still champ 😭
THE TRIBAL KING!
Roman 💪💪💪💪💪❤️
Roman Reigns is losing his respect by winning this championship     😔😔  Maturity is when you accept your win or lose but by this thing I don't thing he is doing well  We want 2016 Roman Reigns with the black  vest
Cody Rhodes needs to dig in deep and bring out the stardust and dashing in him!! 😂
just like that they ruined their top babyface
Can anyone see the number of dislikes ? Lol
I wonder what's in store for roman next who's gonna be his next opponent? Why do I have a feeling it's going to be Logan Paul the one to win the championship 🤣
Roman Reigns is the GOAT 🎉
Cody story is just starting.  Remember KO and Sami was a year story long build and paid off amazingly for them.  Who ever is handling the Bloodline story wants an epic end to an epic story. I'm all for it.
Man show the big moves!
Big mistake, wwe stupid as hell, don't know how to make business
I am sad that will not give us want we want which is for Roman to lose the title.
The Big Question now is: Who do you put Roman against in the short term???
We are at a whooping 53.153 dislikes right now. And since Triple H loves Numbers so much, as he has become the Rainman of the Chair, he's gonna love it.
Seriously, it was the right time for Cody to win..they're running out of people to challenge and defeat Roman..Who will beat Roman ?
Cody should’ve won
Wtf
☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾
Most Stupid Match Ever that Was Cody's moment 😥He deserves To be Champ 💔
Well, i’m of to a loong break on wrestling again, se u in a year!
I agree that Roman reigns needs to lose the title but im happy it wasn't to cody stardust rhodes... that would've been a terrible decision...he's not worthy
WWE FAILS AGAIN THE TRIBLE CHEIF MORE LIKE THE TRIBAL WEIF . NEVER WATCHING WWE AGAIN   AEW AEW AEW...........  BTW CM PUNK IS THE MAN
Roman Reigns is the most dishonest champion I have ever seen in WWE. He never won fairly
Imagine if i told you ten years ago Cody Rhodes will headline WrestleMania
i now hate reigns what happend to the big dog
😡😡😡😡😡 Cody deserved that when i saw sami zayn and kevin owens i thought that was Codys chance but of course Roman Reigns would win no surprise
If Roman attends most of the weekly shows in the future, I'll admit Roman.  I'm looking forward to the full-time active roster, not part-timers, competing for the main championship momentum.   Also, I hope the unified champion will be separated soon.   The momentum of six championships in this WrestleMania has been decided by only two.   This is neglecting the talented superstars held by WWE, and is tantamount to dereliction of duty by WWE.  It is a pity that superstars of this generation are sacrificed for Roman's record and later recorded as valley generation.   They deserve a better career. Their bodies, motor nerves, and youth are not forever. Professional wrestling, in particular, consumes more of these.  Please make a space so that they can shine when they shine the most.   This is enough for Roman's record breaking and career. No one will easily surpass his record. 😂😂
Can say you hate predictable matches and then get made when you get swerved...gotta pick a battle lol
I’m so confused. This was LITERALLY the perfect set up for Roman Reigns to finally lose the Championship.  The whole Cody Rhodes build up….Wrestlemaina….The whole “Hollywood” theme aka A Happy Ending etc…. WWE definitely dropped the ball with this one 😐  Plus I though they said that he was meant be taking a “break” from WWE? 🥴
I really thought WWE was going to let Cody Rhodes get the win. It would've been perfect. But just like the crowd reacted poorly with silence, I too was disappointed. I'm sorry Cody.
The wrong winner, again
As a Roman Reigns fan..I was scared he was gonna lose. The leaked script said Roman was scheduled to lose. But I'm happy he won. Big respect for Cody having the balls to fight him though. 👍 Edit: yes I liked my own comment
Just hear for the comments
Cody had too easy a road to the title. The injury was the only setback. He never lost. Fans don't like when a challenger faces zero adversity. #30 in the Rumble and rolled over everyone. Now he has adversity and now if he wins, it will be more of a shock factor since majority of fans thought he complete his journey at wrestlemania.
It had to be Cody's win .  Roman reigns without his Butlers is nothing. He even doesn't have a special signature and finisher move . What a tribal chief . Worst WWE champion for me 👎  Do they not realize that they don't have any Superstars? Cody Rhodes was the reason to watch WWE again after 20 years and they f***** it up .
This is complete garbage. Roman could as well just retire with the title and then take it to his grave😡. Cody and all the others were always about to beat  Roman but ofcourse they always cheat!!!!
Has to be JEY!!
Cody should have won.
So happy the regin continues, we are one ❤ 1️⃣
this is roman 2016, 2017 vibes
There should be a rule in this matches that no one should interrupt if not this won't just make any sense it should be opponent vs opponent alone.
How we remember Starrcade 1997 is how we will remember this.
I just wonder would it be Hogan vs Sting part 2 all over again, with the same result (company goes down) in the end. Sonetimes you need to give a win to the guy crowd wants the most, not your behind the scenes jabronies.
If there was ever a time to put over the next big babyface it was Cody at this Mania but noooo, all because of that stupid 1000 day number.
I kinda had a feeling they'd let Roman retain. He'll still loose to Cody later down the line, but they wanna milk it a bit and cement Roman as one of the greatest champions before he looses his belts
When they fought it was my sons Birthday and he loves Roman reigns
this is the reason i stopped watching wwe since 2019
Amazing match
Me sorprende que la gente no sepa como funciona wwe xD. Y peor aún que el encargado es triple H, que seguramente le tiene un rencor grande Cody xD
i guess roman cried and cried to hunter enough saying please don't take my belts. so hunter said to his bady don't worry bady i let nothing happen to your belts. cody had him beat. but hunter told his cry baby don't worry i won't let nobody take it.
Roman reagins suck
I'm the only one that's happy that Cody lost apparently.😂
I swear they didn't give him the belt just because they were going to sell the company the next day
Baaaaaam
Surely cody will get his hands on the title soon right??
This time cody deserve a Title😢
Roman Reigns only won because they cheated but I believe Cody is the actual winner even though Roman Reigns won
disgusting finish
😢 Cody Rhodes might have to win this battle sad
WWE, you didn't pull a trigger last night, so i just wonder what's next - Roman defeated every big enough name WWE had to offer, and you didn't switch the champion, you guys must have some good plan in your sleeves right?
Cody should of won, wwe yet messing up in booking, they just lost lost of fans with this crappy ending
😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
The entrances and the match overall was awesome, except for the interference. That was pathetic. I don’t follow up with wrestling every week, but I do know Roman is dominant. Doesn’t need interference. It was suppose to be just a Cody and Roman moment, no one else. What a pathetic display of match creating towards the end. Everything else epic though
7 minute highlight video with 3 minutes worth of entrance. c'mon.
انا عايز اعرف رومان رينز هيفضل معاه الاحزمه wweلاغيت امتى
Roman reigns won most of his matches as champion through cheating
I lav the big always 💯💯❤️❤️🙌🇺🇬
No guys! You have to stop. Wwe has plans for Roman to reign over 1000 days! I think Cody will win Title at summer slam on August 5 don't worry 😉
Man that was Cody’s time
L
Cody ruined
I don't know what WWE is doing. They're just trying to piss off their viewers. They just don't want to admit that AEW and it's champion MJF is doing a lot better than them. Cody deserved it. You S**K WWE!  AEW Forever! N I'm soooo glad that I didn't pay for Wrestlemania😂
How many 👎🏼 to this video WWE? You dropped the ball
رمضان كريم
Worst decision they ever made making Cody lose I really hope you guys get backlash for this big time
I understand the WWE want Roman to be the main superstars but let him win the same way for 3 years please !
Good job my Roman your the best ever from cagayan de oro city Mindanao Philippines
I still can't believe Roman Reigns retained when  Cody lost I was speechless and upset
Cody's popularity was at the highest mountain, there was no better time to transfer the belts
The wwe universum say:"Samy zayn" The wwe says:"Roman reigns!!!!!!!!!!!!!" The wwe Universum say:"Cody Rhodes!!!!!!!!!!!!!! " The wwe says:"Roman reigns!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! " Roman and the bloodline is cool. But we will See Samy or Cody as a new champ.
I can't believe wwe screwed cody like that. This was the right moment for him to win the titles. What was the point of him winning royal rumble
Boring Main Event of All Time.... It should've been Cody to Win This Time... 😞😞😞
Wwe king roman raing 🎉🎉❤❤❤
Roman's boots🔥🔥🔥🔥
Robbed
☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻
All these casual fans coming here complaining without knowing what roman has accomplished in almost 4 years..he deserved to hit 1000 days…he single handedly saved wwe
And there is ROMAN REIGNS the GOAT of the new Era..... But 🙏🙏🙏for CODY  ROADS.
I mean who tf would expect Cody to win against Roman . You're making a fool out of yourself
What a disappointment wwe sucks for this L ending Roman is getting annoying at this point
Liz go
Can't believe they kept Roman as champion. Its getting boring now like watching paint dry. To think he has been given the longest streak is a bit of a piss take to some of the greatest.
Cody you are the true winner. Roman only won because his cronies helped him cheat once again. Your Dad is so very proud of you and so is your family, South Africa ❤❤❤
Fire the person who made this highlights
Cody Rhodes will challenge Roman reigns again
Triple H why did you do this Cody should one
All Cody Rhodes fans should cry🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Summerslam will be Cody's time
F@&% Roman Reigns
مدیریت تقریبا اچ صفربود تابحال نشده رومن تنهایی کشتی بگیره چهارنفربه یک نفر داورها کورند نمیبینند طفلک کودی و جان سینا فقط بخاطر پول پل همرر اینقدر عصبانی وشوکه هستم تایپ غلط  میدونم نوشته های ما بی اثره فقط بدان مدیریتت صفره فقط پول همه مردم ناراضی اند
This was an all time terrible booking lol no one cares about the bloodline without Sami and no one definitely cares to see the Rock if that’s what they’re waiting for. Cody is easily the biggest star in wrestling right now and at this point him winning later wouldn’t mean as much.
Don't like you Roman Reigns  Bequss your cheater
After Finn and Asuka lost this is the only thing I wanted as the outcome.
😡😡😡
Roman can't fight his own fights without the help of his cousin's the USO's and Umaga's son Solo. What u don't know is when Dana White brought WWE he requested that if he buy's WWE. Then Vince McMahon is in charge of WWE. The board of director's reinstated Vince McMahon and Hunter is released has CEO. Vince  reinstated Roman and even hired back the USO'S who was supposed to have been released after there contract was up. That is why they dropped the belt's to Kevin and Zami. What is going to happen is Kevin and Zami will have to hand over the belts since they did not win i guess they are going to say whoever pinned the USO was not legally  tagged in. We deleted  WWE from the DVR. And we will be watching Street Outlaws instead. U don't believe u watch and wait what happen's. That is what the spoiler alert posted will happen. Vince will appear and possibly reveal Dana White own's WWE and  may say that Hunter is no longer controlled. And i bet matches will be like a UFC match.
Wow😂😂😂😂😂😂wen Cody Rhodes won TC then it's amazing 🎉
This was the wrong finish
Tbh im not fans of Roman Reigns but im might be missed his epic entrances soon. Now im gonna enjoy his remaining entrances while can.
His character is so stale... Move on to somebody else
this is why i watch TBS every Wednesday at 8 p.m. Eastern Time.
😢😢😢😮😮😮
Worst match ever
Bye bye wwe!
I just came for the haters crying !! ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR TRIBAL CHIEF AND WWE UNDISPUTED UNIVERSAL CHAMPION ROMAN REIGNS ☝🏻😈☝🏻
Why is Roman making history every main event? i loved Roman when i was a kid but this days i don't i hate even if he might be a mega star, disappointment to all viewers, wwe is just manipulating a fans,
Y they don't show the count
Aknowledge Roman Reigns!
cody should of won this match
Why did night 2 suck so much, the only good match was edge vs finn
I don't watch wrestling anymore came to see highlights of WrestleMania and WWE did what WWE did best shame on them i cannot imagine what all those fan must have felt that's why WWE in not sport and WWE just prove it daily
Say what you will about the maych, but I'm sure we can all collectively agree that cody's entrance attire was 🔥
We are bored of Roman Reigns
roman Looser... not win.. without help
It Really Pisses m e off when Reigns reverts to Cheating. DISGUSTED !! NOT A FAN ANYMORE
The Tribal chief Roman Reigns 🔥🔥💪💪💪
Why do someone likes in different  company likes to cheat and keep like their titles is it WWE doing it
triple h ruined cody's moment cuz after wrestlemania even if roman lost the titles it never be the same :/
Roman is the best
YESSS F U CODY
Biggest disappointment ever
Samy sevenlerine inanamiyom, roman reigns onu kabul etti ama o ihanet etti , onun icin her zaman roman reigns v usos v solo ❤
CODY WILL BECOME A CHAMPION.
I was so angry at the end. It’s kinda getting ridiculous at this point. If they are that into Roman and this record At least split off the wwe title again so we have some variety.
Rumor Raine Bowler Grower
I keep watching this and ask myself "How stupid is WWE for making him lose"   But what an entrance from Cody freaken Rhodes
Their was no handycap match ko and sami zayn vs the usos that why they wom it was awesome but roman reigns was a handycap match like always and then Roman acts like he wom with no help its getting boring already.
Cody hayranlari n oldu 😆😆😆, o hic bir zaman hayranlarini uzmez roman reigns ❤
Seriously universal championship or undisputed universal championship 🤔
كووودي 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
You can tell who booked which night lol
The day a new john cena , the new face could have been born …. Could have been one of the greatest Wrestlemania moments of all time…What a waste man….SHAME
The spear into the sunset flip was so freaking cool. I don't think I've even seen that before.
Cody is real winner on my perspective
This is tired AF. Reminiscent of HHHs reign of terror. I'd rather watch the entire Velma series than five minutes of a Roman match.
Cody Royde has fallen in line to The head of the table...The Tribal chief, Roman god Reigns...
So lame. Having Roman need to cheat to win. His reign is getting old. Time to move on. This was Cody's moment.
Cheating pricks as usual
روومان  افضل مصارع  👍🏼👍🏼🪷
You can just feel the air of disappointment from the crowd
let me find out cody loves him some chocolate 😂😂😏
Cody's attire looks so badass!
Finally I've been waiting for you
Roman Renigns sempre ☝️☝️☝️
What type of highlights is these wwe? Hopeless stupid  ....only half half not showing the finishing move also that won the match .....3rd class wwe
Roman raigns is everything wrong with is family, and he can't even win a singels match without the bloodline getting involved. WWE you really messed up with him
Cody should have won...super disappointing ending!
Would love to seen Cody win it myself he deserves it
Wrestling is fake Cody supposed to win but wwe v planned who will win
So again news terror of Reigns until next Wrestlemania. It just gonna be washed up story and gonna get boring. Same like Cena and The Rock story looks likem then Cody Wins it.
2000's : Triple H burying WCW stars 2020's : Roman Reigns burying AEW stars
This chapter may be over but the story is NOT OVER. Cody will still finish his story!
It was Cody vs the bloodline because Cody is a strong man he dont need help he just do his things by himself
Nothing surprise me because. The interference by The Usos and Kevin Owen and Sammie Zayn
Cody is always a joker..... Only hype there is nothing in Cody..... Always Roman Reigns is the champion 🏆..... Believe that..... First of all don't believe in this crowd, sometimes they like and sometimes they don't 😂😂..... Coming to no1 jokers ko and Sami they don't deserve as a tag team champs and as a friend's..... Both are fighting together only for titles and hype nothing more than that..... 2 irritating idiots......
L Ending
They win every time Roman does the chatting. Do they consider public as idiots? Wwe 🖕🖕🖕
Roman losser
Roman soding of lost
Roman the king 🤴
Cody is such a Crowd Puller!!
Cody Rhodes ❤
Now they've successful guaranteed Cody Rhodes place as the "people's champ" that the company screwed over to prolong the title reign of "company guy" he's more over than he was before going into WrestleMania, because now not only is he over with the fans because of his overall talent and charisma, he's also got sympathy, which I think is more important because that is what is going to guarantee his longevity... Let's be honest people are going to turn on Cody real fast unless they think they're the ones who made it happen and it's not something WWE actually wanted to happen.  That's how he gets over "organically" and not because "he's been forced down our throat"  WWE made the right decision 👍
I think their is still more to the story because like triple h said the story isn't finished
Cody Rhodes is real winner he win many millions heart Cody Rhodes is better then Roman Reigns
this aew booking bs
They got this so wrong.   Same old Roman finish and explain Solo being ringside the moment the ref counts the 3 after being sent to the back?  Horrendous booking decision and they are gonna have to do something pretty special to get Cody his momentum back.   Last night was the right time with the wrong call.
People seem to forget they could have another Edge vs Cena rivalry between cody and reigns Just cus he lost today doesnt mean he wont win it soon
cody's vs bullset 4 but cody's best
Roman WM 39 entrance >>> cody lame story
It's not enough man. Roman has a far greater story. He's been champion from before cody even came to WWE. You can't just let Cody show up and win a few matches against Seth then win the rumble by entering at the last and beat The Guy who's been grinding for this since 2015. Roman's legacy needs to be outshined by a greater legacy or all this will be for nothing.  - I'm not counting from Dusty's time. If you want Cody to finish his story then he's gonna have to grind at the very least half a year more.  - By better backstory I never meant to say Rock should beat Roman that would be an even bigger waste for wrestling.
That's bullsh*t
0:21 that pop tho
Without the Usos and Solo, Roman is nothing not even a Champion
I feel very sad for coady 😢
This storyline is really suck ... !!!!👎👎👎 Need to be stopped immediately !!!!! 😤
They better have a rematch but Cody wins
Sick of it Roman is officially protected seeing one man as a champion for that long is booring but WWE is now making business out it people are soo mad to see Roman lose against someone and make TRP higher and higher.
They must always fight roman reinse in a steel cage for him not to cheat it is really boring watching him cheating and winning over and over again
Man hate Roman so much now he has to cheat every chance he gets to keep those titles I'm surprised that everyone that got pissed did just walk out of that show to prove a point to WWE that they made a huge mistake by keeping those titles on Roman instead of giving them to Cody he deserves it for all he has done he deserves it more than Roman at this point
But the head of the table is too strong
Cody was overall the better
Cody best👍👍💯
Most fan following in ASIA😎  Roman Reigns
Reigns again ? What a joke. Wwe should change their plans now, it’s too much with Reigns
Cody Rose was the most deserving of winning, and after the chaos caused by Roman, he became, in my opinion, unworthy of continuing to hold titles.
the mother of missed opportunities! trips & vince blew it- Cody was robbed! we never had a challenger as fan favourite and as red hot as Cody to go over at Mania in years - sure he can win at another PPV or another Mania but this right here is where he had the max momentum, should have defeated Roman. 2014 Bryan, 2020 McIntyre & 2023 Cody - only the Bryan one materialised to its full potential.
Sorry'bro always roman time,always roman champion 🏆
Maybe cody winning was too predictable but who cares its wrestling he should have won
How can you say your champ is in God mode when he's ending of all the matches is overbooked.....never gonna get this moment again another outsider buried😔💔
Haha , why would people think he would win?  Cody is not better than Brock, Bryan , undertaker .   Yes it’s all scripted , but for him to end the reign , that would be disrespectful to all .
Really... I'm sick of this Champ Roman !!!!! Hey~ you hear me ??? WWE !!!!!!!!! Let Cody win his undisputed WWE Universal Championship !!!!!!!!!!!😤
Solo to cody - you broke my undefeated streak jabroni,,, now I am gonna break your undefeated streak+ dreams.
I acknowledge you my tribal chief😢❤
On my side for now wwe is really borring with the bloodline & Roman Reign everyday fans are tired of them, now Roman can't win without the help of Solo and the Usos, fans need other Champ.
I guess Hell In A Cell match is the only way to defeat him
Superman vs Batman vibes at their entrance
Am so heart broken that Cody lost he the look on his face tells the whole entire story I felt his pain that night he got a push in the wwe that he deserves when returning just to lose but I mean like Cody almost had him right there
WWE Screwed this one up one guy with four other people keeping his title for him. It was time for a change and Cody deserved to be the guy to win that title. Very pissed off right now.
How stupid would it be after Roman dominated everyone for Cody to beat him it makes no sense Roman has been built immovable he needs a handicap to lose.Cody definitely wasn't believable to win.
looser reingns 👎
I have seen champs wearing suits because it brings class,my tribal chief is the most classy champ without wearing a suit, just a messaged shirt, tracksuit pants and jordan sneakers. GOAT
👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
Match start from 3.40.....what is this channel is doing
How much help did this arrogant loser need to defeat Cody Rhodes ? 🙄🙄🙄
Right now and hWWE QUINCY Right both yuo should
This match was insane. I haven’t watched wrestling since I was like 13 and I’m 28 now. Glad I tuned in, these guys left it all in the ring.
This was Cody's moment, and you ruined it Vince, this wasn't a Triple H decision
Cody should have won
the next opponent may well be Omos, then Rommen Reings has a problem as big Giant, Brock Lasner defeated Omos this weekend, Rommen Reings can do that too.
Cody should have won, The crowd the energy, there was everything and still Wwe screwed him over
See I think they changed the outcome to match when people kept leaking that Roman was looking to take time off so everyone was thinking Cody would win cuz of that but they fooled us all 😂👍🏽
مبروك رومان رينز الاحتفاظ باللقب العالمي ،،
How disappointing
I hopefully Brock will beat him this time
Lost a bunch of money on this fight... I wonder how much the referee made?
Rock vs cena lite
Roman reing no es nada sin ayuda edicho😡😁
Like always, Roman Reign always needs the help of the USOS to win ! Cody Rhodes would have definitely won this match 😡
Reign of terror 2.0,just straight up disappointing.
Wwe should hire a better video editor for their youtube channel
Yo queria q ganara cody
What a waste
…
Otha Cody Cody nu kuvuninga , vachan paru appu , Roman kita lam mudiyuma , past 3 weeks gandu ethikutu irunthinga , correct ha last week roman sonan , otha Cody lavda nee ore match kuda win panala straight ha WrestleMania sapa vantia nu , idaan ...
I'm not going to complain about this booking until the story's been told and finished. This could just be a chapter in an amazing story.
I was there. Amazing night
Cody sucks glad Roman won Cody isn't even mid card worthy
Without his 3 spoons 😏 Roman cant win , thats fact
WWE should be ashamed it was Cody's time and Roman is old news. Its getting very old the same old scenario, he always comes out on top its getting very boring and making people not want to waste there time with the main events as we already know its the Roman show. I think WWE need to start listening to what there fans actually want.
L
This is Ramon very looser boy
I will never Roman rance win the match
Stop holding ya stomach in Roman
To all over show will be planning to the game
It was not only Cody vs Roman it was like Rhodes vs Samoan. Honestly if there’s anyone who deserves to dethrone Roman is undoubtedly Cody. But I think just the timing wasn’t right. I see most of the complaints are about no title change in Day2 of WM. But at this modern age of wrestling being a new champion is very predictable where baby faces aren’t fully favourite to fans and heels are sometimes loved by fans. Also the Bloodline story seems kinda unfinished. And it would be great if they finish this story in the same way they have started this with Jey Uso and Roman.
That baby is an abomination.. And that sister is a racoon 😢
Only Roman Can Do This 🔥😈
Its getting boring as nothings new in wwe now..same stuff...everyone knows whats gonna happen.lmao
This is the fac game
This was too much, just for crossing 1000 days they cody this way
Roman 🤩🤩😍
Worst match WrestleMania Worst event WWE Worst Promotion Triple H Worst booker Vince Worst promoter Roman Worst wrestler Heyman Worst manager Usos Worst tag team Solo Worst enforcer (smaller than Heyman) WWE Worst Wrestling Entertainment 😮😮😮
Roman rance his is biggest cheeter
how this happened my first time to see this match i don't understand
shows roman is still the head of the table with no people to eat with
I didn't like that Roman reigns won😢
I have no idea why they gave roman the win? Can anyone explain to me why they didn't give cody his moment? Does vince being involved again have anything to do with this finish. I don't see why triple h would build cody up like this to have him job to roman with a pathetic finish like that. This sorta finish should be for a lesser paper view not the main event of wrestlemania. Very disappointed wwe.
HAHA ANDDDDD STILLLLLLLLL!
🤣🤣  Awful decision , this company as been 💩💩 for over a decade now ....
Everyone carries Cody. You can tell.
why this happened to code
Cody win A Heart
Fun fact, some people expected AEW to defeat WWE at the grandest stage of WWE. ✌️
I think wwe wants roman reings to beat hulk hogan record first before loosing the  title
Cody lost
Great Run for Roman :- Hated Hero to Loving villian
Didn't sound much of a pop for Cody
At this point they've shoved Roman down our throats more than Hogan and Super Cena combined.
The guy can't win a match without help 😂 cheater roman
The same old Situation, Román can't win without help, wwe sucks whit this... What a shame whit Cody, he deserve It the victory
☝️☝️ acknowledge him
Oscar
❤❤❤❤  cody rhodes acknowledge  Roman Reigns👑👑
Roman, Heyman, Bloodline what an epic storyline, probably something most badass after two decades since atitude era. ☝️
Man they have a perfect opportunity to crown new champions they runied every thing this will not hunter decision this will be Vince decision
What kinda endings was that
At this point we need Punk back so Roman can drop those titles if he isn't dropping it to Cody or Drew McIntyre.
WWE is finish
Yes yes yes  Roman deserves everything man Cody can never b close to it
I love roman Reigns, but he is wining all times I don't likes it. Means.... It's enough man now. Two- three years spent but still roman reigns is undisputed champion. Give another chance to other superstars man. Wwe should do anything.
Cody Rhodes should have won😢
I hope Roman Reigns is champion till WM40
Thank you Trip
Bloodline ❤
Last time Michael Cole's emotions were through the roof during a superstar's push, it was Daniel Bryan (Bryan Danielson) winning the title later on. So Cody might have a shot at redemption
poul heymen is greatest stage of success for tribal chief  better then beast with poul heymen ☝☝☝☝☝☝
Imagine not grabbing the Brass Ring on a Legendary Storyline. You absolute baffoons.
He’s a Jabroni
Roman as champion is ending the WWE he is great but the story is played out every match family involved tell the rock comes or sola wants a title chance we all see the bs
I don´t know why i keep seeing wrestlemania and every year is getting worst and only makes me angry.
Am I the only one that loves the way Paul Hype's up Roman Kinda Better than With Broc because Roman is also good on the Mike too
Roman is never 🙅 beaten like this he has much power 💪⚡ those who liner between 👉❗👈 the both tille WWE & UNIVERSAL CHAMPION OF ALL TIME AS U KNOW LONGEST TIME EVER ❤ ACKNOWLEDGE ME 🖕
Cody return to aew

Cody could’ve won tbh
The right man won
How good is Michael Cole 🎤
Why Cody looking like homelander on his entrance though 😂😂😂
Acknowledge your Tribal chief ☝️☝️☝️☝️ Roman against the world ☝️☝️☝️
Roman Reigns is best💯 in the world I watch wwe  only reason roman raings
This stuff is so cringy
They Lex Lugered Cody .......😢😢😢
They don't give a damn about the fans now if cody does win it is for nothing that pop he got was his time to hold that belt. Roman and the bloodline is getting old and stale
Did anybody notice the satnic ritual with Edge and that balor guy
مصارعه بروك ليسنر ورومان رينز كانت افضل وانا اعتبر بروك ليسنر البطل
Love for Roman❤❤
Greatest Champ Of All Time ☝️♥️ Acknowledge your Tribal Cheif 😎
This is  not fair
CHEATERS stupid usos they suck and the lost
If he’s gonna be champ for another year can we please change the belts!!
We're not tired of Roman Reigns. We're tired of how the WWE is booking Roman Reigns.
Bosta de vídeo
Vince McMahon & his obsession with Roman continues ....
Foo Cody should have won
Thanks Roman reigns....
The Bloodline will, Get the belts Back.
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
Cody is the real champion because each and every time roman wins with the help of bloodline members cheating. Wwe should wins the real champion
Nd pls clear 1 champion WWE nd tag fr raw nd smack down
Triple H never forgot about the time Cody broke his throne back in 2019 at double or nothing. WWE would have never allowed the founding member of AEW to dethrone Roman Reigns for the wwe universal championship.
They did dirty with my boi cody 😠
Intercontinental champion nd wwe championship
Cody is a Diamond, he just doesn't wrestle, he brings emotions , spirit , drama , sells moves , makes opponents look good . Involves the crowd . A Treasure indeed
This company is bad a reasonable person to represent how bad it’s gotten.
It's should be a clear match no any interferences
2 big mistakes sad 2 c
Man....why
WWE.
You cant hate cody for real
This guy..--- Roman Reigns --- isn't  a real champion...is just a  fake....      Unfortunately, this is  the reality ....
Canceling my peacock subscription. Worst ending ever to WrestleMania. Stopped watching wwe last year in October and should have kept with that.
I congratulate the invincible Roman. So that you lose already. fed up!
Always always always usos brother keep cheating the matches of Roman Reigns and disappointed the whole match😢Love you Cody.
Feliz 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 mucho
My bast farind Roman Reigns I am Indian
Like always has to cheat to win can't do it on his own
I’ve been saying it for months, y’all underestimate Cody’s ability to tell a story
I think WWE wasted the moment to put Cody over to complete this 'chapter' properly. I'm all for the story continuing but I think it was wrong for Roman to go over AGAIN. If/When Cody does go over it's like some of the shine has been taken off of it, slightly tarnished
Lol and everyone thought Cody was gonna win 😂 Knew Roman would retain
Am so done with wwe wrestling this should have been Cody night the champion
Honestly I don't like roman entrance music I like that time music when roman reigns was the guy that shelid one
Screw you WWE... you did Balor, Cody and Asuka dirty AGAIN Never touching your product ever again... I'm just gonna watch AEW from now on
I hate Roman Reigns for ever No 1 cheater in WWE history
I saw this coming after THE USOs lost their belts
Roman last 3 matches Kevin Owens , Sami Zayn , Cody Rhodes 🚮
Cody should have won the match
You can’t always get what you want and The right man won. We are not having The Greatest Final Boss in the modern era loose to a HALFASS CODY RHODES that just got here at Wrestlemainia 39. He is the guy to eventually beat Roman Reigns but not at Wrestlemainia 39. Cody Rhodes needs to struggle more.
Cody's❤
Roman is the champ and won because he is the best
The finish wasn't special either if it was anyone but sikoa costing the match like randy Orton it would've been cool and unpredictable but no same old finish that becomes stale the more it is used
Roman is a heel...heel win the game everytime help....that is not problem...but every people showing a new champion 🏆
It was Cody's time. This was messed up
you broke my heart, an adult bearded man
Im guessing Cody gonna learn from this loss and have to go through a whole year of learning to bounce back and next mania dethrone Roman.
Congrats on starrcade 97 part 2. Is Cody just gonna beat Roman a month or 2 from now anyway just to give Roman that pointless 1000 days mile stone or is Roman going after Bruno's record next? It was wrestlmania, is Roman really gonna lose at a random ppv?
I was so fed up with the Usos coming to interupt the match...then Solo just came out nowhere and hit Cody Rodes with that thumb 😢 man it was his time to end the Roman Reigns era but as we all know @wwe are always protecting this man. So sick man when are you going to give other people a chance at greatness...
Really man!!😩....wwe gave  this interference bullcrap ..in every roman reings's matches........but please.......not in the  most awaited  WrestleMania main event match too😵.......it's Cody 's time .....he was so good.....when will this wwe give what the fans want......after all these years.....a people who loves wwe can see it's in last struggling legs......so freaking disappointed 😖😵‍💫😵😫
Uncle Howdy will take Roman's belts 😂
Fkn Roman such a p**sy, cheating is the only way he can win. This shouldn't be allowed at all😑😑
Worst wrestlemania Sunday ever
This is not fair play..re..match please
Don't worry Cody .your true champion in this match❤😊.
What a match... Tribal chief vs American nightmare 2 plz
AND STILL ☝🏽🩸
loved that when Cody got down to the ring he went right to his family, and couldn't hold back tears when he gave that weight belt, which you could see was autographed on the inside by probably almost everyone in the locker room, to Brodie
IT WOULD BE BATTER IF WWE MAKES CODY RHODES NEXT BIGGEST CHAMPION AT WRESTLEMANIA BACKLASH
What a missed opportunity first Sami and now Cody
I'm glad I skipped night 2 after seeing Roman wins again. Do they even have an endgame for him yet? Or we are just going to keep doing misery booking forever?
تمثيل وكذب
If wwe wanted roman to retain till 1000 days why didn't they make roman vs the rock, I mean it's Hollywood, and Cody vs roman could've happened next year now it won't feel special if they fight again and cody wins
Please next Brock Lesnar vs roman reigns
Cody is comedy 🤣.. acknowledge Roman 🧡
Look basically Roman Reigns is WWE's greatest of all time superstar.... WWE slowly making him one of the greatest icons of sports entertainment....as an example I can say- once there's a Undertaker and now here's a Roman ....at this point no one is scheduled to beat him except the one inch bigger icon than him ...and he's the One and only The Rock... and that's how the story ends
We all watch WWE because of Roman no one better than Roman Reigns i icknowledge my travel chief we love you..
It only means one final conclusion....The Prodigal Son needs to show his evil side if he want to conquer this God
well... can i see roman next raw? lol no deserve
Wwe you will have not been CD .CD is best I  H roman
Romanreigns ☝️
Damn it wwe
This was rigged Cody should of won by no bloodline had to come and ruin it
ROMAN REIGNS THE TRIBAL CHIEF THE HEAD OF THE TABLE ❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
ROMAN 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
Reigns is being pushed as the greatest wwe superstar ever surpassing Hogan, Rock, Austin and Cena etc.
This sucked so bad. WWE need to stop booking heels to win. Sometimes the right thing to do is for the popular guy to win the match. This sucked so so bad, if Cody wins it at another point it won’t have the same shine. People saying the Rock vs Roman should be for the title, wake up. That match is so big it doesn’t need the title
Roman Reign all time win match only by cheating …
Roman Reign is a big Cheater … Wwe is day by day boring …
no  one can defeat roman
Tatti Roman
Dang that Waaaaooohhh was LOUD 0:20
Just because of the 1000 day reign we lost moments that could go down as the greatest moments in wwe history like cody winning at WrestleMania and Sami taking revenge on roman and the bloodline. Now if he loses at summerslam to cody it would be predictable and not as special as now. Wwe needs to make unpredictability a thing and give fans what they want instead of focusing on stupid records. Might as well make roman break Bruno sammartino's record or better yet moolah's, that would be fan, right?!?!
🔥Roman Reigns🔥
Que poco respeto  para el público tiene la directiva al no establecer reglas  fondo solo estén los dos contrincantes y no permitir la ayuda o trampa de los familiares
Finn Balor,Drew McIntyre,and Cody Rhodes the only WWE Superstars who so close to defeating Roman Reigns Title Run
☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿
Cody definitivamente lo merecía
No body could defeat roman reigns.he is supreme emperor.
1000 day Román reings
Acknowledge him ☝☝☝☝🔥🔥🔥🔥
Roman can't not fight alone
I don't have patience to stomach Roman anymore. He's a lame part-time mediocre wrestler. Triple H, you f*cked up big time.
Solo will have to turn on Roman if he wants to be a big star
My question is who are you gonna bring to dethrone roman? Is it gonna be jey who gets pinned on weekly basis? Is it gonna be randy nopes you already used cena and edge and if they dont stand a chance how can randy? Is it gonna be aj styles nopes because roman has beaten his type too (shinsuke,balor). Is it jay white? Then again if trips cant trust rhodes coming from outside why would they trust a njpw guy
Can we Acknowledge the fact that Roman Reigns is simply a Winner? LETSSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOO‼️☝🏽💯
Stupid Roman
Wwe screwed up again
Oh god is this real? Another year of Roman? Another decade? Century?😒
YouTube can’t show the number of dislikes but I hope this vid will become most disliked video over here on YouTube.
i understand why Roman won kinda but man if Cody won it would've been so cool,   Roman will soon get to 1000 days as Champion which is cool but damn imagine if Cody won that title
Absolutely pathetic ending 😭😭😭😭😭😭 it was Cody's night man 😭😭😭😭he owned that 😭🔥🔥🔥feeling sad for codey 😭..
He should've won man!
show me the dislikes
Acknowledge me ☝🏽
Roman cannot fight alone. What the use of such unbeaten record. A man should fight like a man.
Roman is gonna stay champ if this BS goes on.he didn't even had to wrestle.
Well this sucks
That woaaaahhhh ohhhhh was lit 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥goosebumps 🔥🔥
Dislike
Atleast wwe could split one from those tittles so cody could fulfill his dream. So sad for Cody he rushed his life to reach at this moment. He struggle alot man he deserves to be a top guy🥺🥺
I think Cody losing is a part of his story, it's just that Roman's title reign is going too long. Let's hope it happens it Summerslam. Maybe Solo wins MITB causing drama in the Bloodline.
Hahahaha  Rip those watching main event
Most poor editing @wwe
Stupid script, lame people running this pathetic company.
Well done👏👏 One of the best decisions you have made. ACKNOWLEDGE HIM
I’ve said it once and I’ll say it a 1000 times Paulie is a F’n genius
Yes sir ☝️
Cody did not deserve to win. He is one of the best on the roster but get to the back of the line and work for ur next opportunity
LETS GO ROMAN YOU ARE WESTLE MANIA YOU ARE THE GOAT!
Cody relearn grass isn't greener on the other side
This will probably go down as the worse wrestlemania ending ever
All I know now is WWE will only dethrone Roman reigns by making him lose to Cody only.
Es una falta total de respeto hacia Cody y casi todos los luchadores que pierden contra el bulto por qué es eso lo que Román un simple bulto nunca ganó solo siempre con ayuda
Cody won the match ! Not Roman what's it's name !.. Cody beat Roman what's it's name, at in my knowledge , I acknowledge Cody beat Roman what's it's name !
Imagine if Bryan lost at Wrestlemania 30  Imagine if Steve Austin lost at Wrestlemania 14  Imagine if Batista lost at Wrestlemania 21  Imagine if Rey Mysterio lost at Wrestlemania 22  Imagine if Kofi lost at Wrestlemania 35  see the problem here?
I will never watch another wrestlemania  as long as it's pg. The entire show was pathetic.
Cody: "Hey, Papa H, can I please win the title?" HHH: "Nooooo, we gotta bury youaaaaaaaahhhh!!"
Please change the title Anoa'i family vs Cody rhodes
what a bad highlight!
Still pissed Cody didn't win it :(
Cody is going to win soon
☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝
Roman reigns ❤
Im done with WWE. I’m moving to AEW cause I’m soooooo mad that Cody didn’t win the undisputed titles
So glad Roman won, Cody isn’t the man!
Cody carry the entire match. Reigns can't even wrestle .
This was a pathetic company idea to have cody lose
Stupidity It should be cody's win.
I would go into how disappointed I was/am, but I already knew the outcome when he didn't come alone. Typical cheat match with Roman. If I was Cody, I'd leave. That was so crappy how they done him, and the crowd. Roman holding both belts for so long is getting quite booooooring. He's not unbeatable. I think it's very crappy not allowing other wrestlers to have a chance at either belt. Surprised they let Sammy and KO win. It also would've been nice to not have heard the wrestlers tell each other what they were about to do. How times have changed ...
I am tired of Roman Reigns
I hope those fools who said cody will win learn their lesson from this, he was no match for the head of the table
This was profound stupidity 😂😂😂😂 ah to think that a full person with a full brain thought that would be a good idea cracks me up.
WWE messed up, man:( It was Cody’s night!
No he is not the best
The match was phenomenal.  Just very disappointed with the finish.
You all know how Montreal felt at the Chamber
Roman is the Best ❤️🔥🔥
At this point, it's clear Roman can't retain without help. The weakest link in the bloodline is Roman Reigns. It would have been more poignant for Cody to lose without Sami and K.O. stepping in when the Usos and Solo interfered.
Were  Randy And the rok
In the end Roman needed HELP to secure the win😂😂
47k people are disrespecting my tribal chief
Same Old story line can only keep the title by cheating, he can't win a match completely on his own.
Same Old story line can only keep the title by cheating, he can't win a match completely on his own.
The bro is coming for you Roman
Why wwe
At this point the intercontinental title is more interesting than the main titles.
That was awesome!!! but Cohdy should have won, it would of been best for business. None the less still great.
Bro wwe really has lost its magic man and it’s so sad to see this whole match was predictable asf 🤣
ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR TRIBAL CHIEF ROMAN REIGNS ☝🏾
😮
Watched Wwe since 1989...... Never been so upset than for this outcome !!! Cody deserved it !!!
Its been 3 years. the great wrestlers that were supposed to be champion are aging and losing their best years for this " story " of roman's legacy. smh.
No sé ve cómo es que ganó no se vale
Look I know my comment will get a whole lot of hate but honestly its awesome that Roman won they needed to hit 1000 days and no offense to cody I love him but I feel like he needs to take a bit longer before he wins the main title
I acknowledge you my tribal chief ☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻
Reigns is one of the worst champions in history always same bland ending getting help from his crew
im glad roman won but can he ever fight without getting help 😂
Buried Cody thanks WWE
Wwe made a huge mistake
Roman come up got a lot of haters angry. I love his come up and been invested since 2020- until now. Whether he loses or wins. This is a storyline and not real life the way y’all fans are making it out to be. Cody is talented but I don’t think he’s on Randy Orton type level how y’all making him out to be. I believe he will become the champion down the line but the fans are hateful at Roman. Like they have a issue seeing Roman Reigns at the top of this company and just say that. I like Roman Reigns better, he’s entertaining, and been playing this narcissistic role well. It’s good a man of color is at the top of the company because we haven’t seen this since The Rock short term WWF/WWE career back then as well. Y’all Cody fans are delusional & hateful. It’s the delusions for me 😂.
عالی
forever together my tribla chief ☝️
What don’t wwe understand about the fan base is getting sick of Roman reigns you can’t kick out that much.
Does anyone think CM Punk was spot on when he said (doing the HHH voice) "I don't think he has what it takes." I think Cody should have won, but the politics in WWE wouldn't allow it.
Im in tears Liberty n Lil Brodie was there to it was his moment
It sucked. The ending sucked. Same old stuff you have done for 3 years. You can only do this so many times before people quit watching. It gets old. You have walked that line to far and you stepped over last night.
Roman why not hand one of those belts over to Solo Sikoa since he is the reason you won the match!!!!!
Legacy vs Shield.
michael cole is so biased lol
good match, but the ending was just stupid and we saw it thousand times now... just disappointed
I love cody the best
Brock should really be Champion💪💪💪💪💪
Lost all my interest. I have zero desire to see Roman hold the belt longer. Last night would've been the perfect place to wrap a bow on this story and move on. Anything from here will be less
Perdio el Wrestling y Roman sigue ganando con ayudas, le hacen perder credibilidad! se notó que Vince metió mano en esta pelea
I DON'T THINK REIGNS EVER WON, ON HIS OWN😅😅😅
Wtf Cody shoulda won
Roman is highly overrated and horrible in the ring
Augh another month with Roman lames I'm tired of this dude I swear
The baby is so cute
Why so many ppl love cody Rhodes???like seriously why though
let go cody rhodes
Many thought if the Usos lost, Roman would to. This match was a rollercoaster ride and it made it seemed that the Tribal Chief was done, but then that swerve changed everything. I’d be content whether it was this outcome or the other. Great performance by both.
Typical run ins, squashing white-hot runs by your three biggest babyfaces in the past six months, and the opportunity for the endgame in front of 81,000 people totally wasted. Instead, you run with a storyline and booking that should have come to an end months ago. Right back to being stale, boring and repetitive. Anyone else notice how they sucked all the air out of the building within 15 seconds of Sikoa's return?! The only thing missing was the ring filling with trash, a la the nWo.  You can't tell me you'd rather drag this on until the summer (or even next April), just to get him past 1,000 days. Reportedly there was a $21 million gate for the weekend. This is the kind of writing and booking that means you're going to lose at least that much by the summer. The only way this pays off is having 80K in Detroit in August when you turn the page, and even then it might be too late.
I don’t know if the hype will still be around for Cody if he wins at Summerslam
Just never see one on one……typical WWE
I honestly don't know why everyone is complaining about Roman winning, don't get me wrong I know Cody should've had his moment at WrestleMania 39 but Roman's been champ since 30th August 2020 at Payback, so far he's been champ for 946 days, with how long he's been on top of WWE it's only fair he has his reign ended after being champ for 1000 days, that'll take his reign to 27th May then he can lose his titles on that day.
Canceled my Peacock sub, won't be coming back. Vince has got to go and if the 47k down votes vs the 29k upvotes don't wake up the rest of the board and investor nothing will. I hope Endeavor forces him out in a hostel takeover and leaves him broke.
Are we going to find out in like a decade that Roman sacrificed his first new born baby or something to get the longest push in history?   IDK, he at least had a good match and looks the part now.   In a way I get why Cody did not win, creative would likely not know what to do with his story arc after finally getting what he wants.  Cody will have to go heel to become champ if he does not want to win and loose the belt in three months either way.  The only way a babyface keeps the title long is if the fans reject them as a babyface.  Cody is super over but has yet to go ruthless and psycho.
Mfs really made Cody lose in front of his whole family
Wwe is fake stop westing your money please
The bloodline bullsh*t the WWE management needs to do something about this F*cked up interference besides we need a rematch with the bloodline barred from ring side🙌🏾🤬😡
well the usos lost but the tribal chief retained
HHH burying superstar for good i see always the petty one
이왕 ㅈ된거 띠어리가 뺏거나 브레이가 복수한다는 의미로 다시뺏어보자 똥이 안닦이면 똥을 더 묻혀보자
Cody is best
WWE - Shame on you for creating such pathetic story.. How long will you keep one person has the WWE champion and make the Whole Roaster look like dumb idiots...
HUGE L Cody deserves better than this Roman REIGN OF TERROR 2.0 NONSENSE!
Wrestlemanias 37 38 & 39 are disappointed
I liked this twist. Roman is the man.. I acknowledge you my tribal chief 🙏
Bro that WOOAA at 0:17 PERFECT...
So wwe doesnt have champ matieral athletes then if they cant change these titles 😂
Thank God Roman won
Masterful. WWE is at their best when the fans can’t predict or are so emotional over the ending.  Big props to Michael Cole who has been the voice of WWE for many years. Other main stays have done their service and moved on but Cole keeps that excitement level of old. He delivers with top level emotion and vocal commitment and should be recognized for being so passionate about his job.   From the pandemic with empty arenas to now…  Incredible comeback.  ❤
❤❤❤King is king🎉🎉🎉 conz roman
I acknowledge you 👆 my Tribal Chief
So now what??
WWE does the same thing over and over again. Before it was John Cena winning all the time, now it's Roman reigns. Then they wonder why ratings are down
As much as I’m a fan of Cody I feel this is his way to make it back in the business after dissing HHH and his throne but hope he can win this year
A big ol stinky fart to end the night
I'm the type who usually can't get behind babyfaces. Cody is one of the very rare exceptions and I don't think the same momentum will happen again anytime soon. Even if the rivalry continues and he does win, it won't feel as special as right now.
Roman reigns always need help to win I know he is a heel but he don't need help to win
When does the streak end?😢😢
what a battle man i almost thought cody  was gonna win and the part when sami zayn and kevin owens came to help cody rhodes but roman won
yeah, BOREman Lames
Even though I was torn between the two of them, I was really hoping for Cody to win! But I knew that Roman was going to win because that is what cheating does! It helps him win! So, now we have to wait for Cody’s and Romans second match without Romans family on the sidelines to help him win!
Honeslty really boring to have Roman Reigns as the face of the wwe. He is lame and boring to watch. Super overrated
2 to 1 ratio of dislikes lol
People defending this don't realize something.... No main tittle matches until next wrestlemania, no week shows, no dark matches, no PLE, no nothing, when is he gonna lose at least one tittle? At the amazing money bringer main event deserving backlash? Or at the Saudi Arabia main event scene with a crowd can't stop watching their cellphones? U.S and intercontinental are the only thing we have now, you understand that? A part timer can't hold both show tittles for another year
romang es un flojote solo se esconde detras de los primos
If Cody turns heel he should play into the Homelander vibe
Cette clim, c'était incroyable x’)) Personne ne battra le Chef Tribal !!!
King Roman reigns 🎉
People are not honest with themselves. They wanted Roman to lose or have the spoiler blogs be right MORE THAN they wanted Cody to win and that’s the big difference. Like, I wanted Sami & Owens to win more than the Usos losing.
WWE stole money from all the people in attendance. Reigns cheating to win is so boring and lazy. Raw still has a part time champion that won’t show up. Pathetic. When Cody wins it will not be as big as it would have been.
I'm going to commit suicide because roman reigns won again again again. 😢
I think this is for the best. Now, Cody starts again his way to the top, increasing his history as a pro wrestler winning MITB, then he continues his rivalry with Solo in hell in a cell and having a super push after royal rumble calling to roman to cash his contract in WM40 in a triple threat match against whoever, then finally winning covering roman and the other guy, just like roman did in WM 37. To finally make himself champion once and for all
No matter what anyone says, coming from someone who has never been a fan of Reigns - I am still glad he kept the titles. Cody was not ready, he didn't have the build-up and you can tell he's not as over as Rollins or Sami at this point.  If you asked me a year ago, I would've wanted Cody to beat Reigns. If you asked me back in January, I would've said no. The injury set him back hard, but he will come back. Summerslam will be WILD.
i just came here to dislike
So much for finishing the story unless they have a rematch. But at this point looks like the Rhodes family will never be world champions.
Cody deserved the strap. The fans haven’t wanted a baby face on top this bad for a long time.
Again and again Paul Heyman  and the usos with their cousin cheated.
Giving them the benefit of the doubt. Very excited for raw tonight
Greatest cheat ever everyone knew the brothers were gonna come out Roman hasn't won one on his own in a long time now so if cheating and not being able to do it on your own makes you great then yeah he's the goat....lame
Terrible highlight video! You didn't even show the finish!
Haven’t been into the WWE in a while, Where’s Daniel Bryant 😂 and who’s this Cody dude
Howw thought
I'm glad it wasn't Cody cuz it should have been Sami. Wwe dropped the ball awhile ago.
Same old WWE
Great match guys
One of the best if not the best matches I have seen in years
Roman Reigns is a coward. He has to cheat to win. He is not high quality champion. Cody Rhodes should be the champion.
I didn't want Cody to win this one.  My reasoning was simple, he returned at WrestleMania one year prior,  and spent months injured.    Before people get butthurt and think I don't want Cody as champion, you couldn't be more wrong.  However I want him to earn it, I want him to have a healthy year, wrestle every week or every other and prove he's "earning" it.  Not have one great feud then be sidelined by injury to return and be handed a Royal Rumble win.
Horrible.  Reigns is so old and boring
Unsubscribing from peacock! Hate WWE!!! Shoving Roman down our throats like John Cena.
hopefully he will drop the belts at backlash.
Cody wins the belt tonight on Raw. Vince McMahon makes the match
No mames arruinaron el evento con eso jajajaja
Bloodline always cheating is getting really boring!
aew > wwe
wwe scumbags
boooooooooooooooooooo
Use me as a dislike button
beautiful match 😢🔥
Still wondering who threw the toy chicken at cody at the end of the match
Man love this twist! Paul Heyman! This man is the best manager of all times lol his antics make me laugh lol
I hope Roman Reigns breaks the record of Bruno Samartino title Reign
Did the whole roster sign the weight belt of Cody 1:43
Great result. Cody winning now is too premature. By Summerslam he will have overcome the right number of challenges and get to beat Roman in a match where Roman loses the belts in event of a DQ or interference. Means Cody can beat Roman clean!
Time for Cody Rhodes to quit once again and join AEW or Impact wrestling because WWE is the tribal chief's yard 🔥
It’s gotta be Jey Uso that beats Roman
I and almost everyone agrees that Cody should've won there's no other better option, i like Roman but this title reign will be very much the same mean if they booked everytime and especially now in WrestleMania with bloodline interfering then pretty much every PPV will do the same thing until either SummerSlam or WrestleMania 40.
Right call. Cody comes in, wins a few matches and he's expected to be the one to end a 900+ day reign. No way, man. That title is for SAMI to take away from Roman, not Cody.
Roman only wins when his cousins are involved. Known fact
Roman's matches are so stale he looks like he is going to lose till the last second when the bloodline interferes. He really needs to drop those titles.
If Cody is a mid tier talent, Roman is a low tier dude is given everything by wwe don't know how to do promos give him Paul heyman, didnt have alot of hype give him the bloodline, all his moves are basic his finisher is literally a football takedown which is what he is just a NFL player
Well wwe again ruined the moment with their forced superstar push but I guess selling the company they needed their boy Roman on top with his little pet solo.
Guess he will win it at summerslam then
WWE is Rubbish
Boooooo
STOP PLAYIN WITH THE TRIBAL CHIEF ITS NOT TIME GO CRY
Enough wwe this enough 😡😡😡😡👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
I hate Cody Rhodes and when I was on the plane to Los Angeles I met his father in law Cody should go back to aew he doesn’t deserve to be in the WWE
Roman Reigns is not ready to lose ❤😂 his title ❤❤❤❤
Cody vs Roman Hell in a Cell in WM 40, HHH already booked it
Bro Cody's entrance was everything
As expected
A bad ending to nearly the perfect Wrestlemania. Huge fumble
HAHAHAHAH ACKNOWLEDGED MEEEEE☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼🌹
who had the bigger pop of the night? Codys entrance or Shanes quad?
Roman Suck!
Man Roman used to be squashed by Brock in Manias. Now Roman is all strong and all now. Unbelievable
I'm really annoyed . Cody should have won it comes to prove Roman can't win without the help of his goons....storyline is becoming boring now....
We need Roman vs Cody part 2 next Mania. Last night was amazing until the Solo spike
Vince vs dana book it
الا مركيا
Greatness of all time, this is his yard now, the Roman Empire, god bless the tribal chief, Roman Reigns.
Clicking the dislike won’t do anything anyways 😒
roman es el rey
Wwe has never let an outsider win their debut or return debut wrestlemania,  not even STING.
WrestleMania was fantastic ,Triple H makes it again prestigious,you hate the ending its okay,but in my view Reigns winning tonight is the beggining of the end of the BLOODLINE. Think about it,Usos will leave him because he will be mad at them losing the tag titles and in the end when he ll be completely alone he will lose the titles too!   PS : Aknowledge the Tribal Chief!!
Roman is absolut the best !!!!!
ruined a special moment. won't be watching Monday
Romans plot armor is unreal
What a joke of a champion. Can't win matches and retain without help from 3 other guys.
The upset is a much better decision imo - Cody will have his moment in another pay per view, and they gave the win to Sami and KO to tie a bow to that story.   This will keep people invested, Roman can reach 1000 days, and by the time Cody wins, the KO/Zayn vs Usos fued will have come to an end and we can get Roman vs Bloodline
Romans title reign is like stagnet pond water.   It’s getting boring.  It would have been nice to see a new champ.    Cody or anybody.   Currently it’s just getting boring to watch anymore.      My two cents
Roman Reigns need to prove he could win without the bloodlines help
I was waiting at the end for someone to come out and be like “restart the match and everyone is banned from ringside”. Sadly never happened….
I will never forgive WWE for what they did to Cody 💔
Roman Reings you winner ❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Enough with Roman. Enough is enough @WWE.
Why is it always the same boring Ending? This Match was awesome and the perfect Moment to rise Cody up, Where He belongs. Messed up in the last minute. I'm sad now......
😡😡😡😡😡😡
Im going to AEW
Screw roman reigns and his 1000 days i mean come 3 years is more than enough, stop shoving him down our throats like u did with the brock previously
You all though that Roman was gonna loose to an AEE founder at WrestleMania?
That was a waste of a push. No better time, wrestler or stage to dethrone Reigns. Cody will not have the same momentum after this. Sad.
Kevin Owens- rumble 2021 Daniel Bryan- wrestlemania 37 Edge- MITB 2021 Brock Lesnar- Crown Jewel 2021 Seth Rollins -Royal rumble 2022 Drew McIntyre- Cardiff 2022 Sami- EC 2023 Cody Rhodes- wm 39 Guys who were hot enough to win the title at those moments. Wrestlers who’s momentum was ruined during this title reign
Roman shouldn’t be champ
Once AGAIN WWE shows just how massively predictable, they really are. The whole Roman & Puzzos is SO PLAYED OUT. However, do they change? NO. Another massive so-called WrestleMania fail. John Cena was called in to be a lacky again - predictable.  Seriously if you're just going have Roman beat EVERYONE who is seriously much higher grade then him - really what's the use anymore? There is a reason WWE stock and rating have fallen the last few years. What does Roman have on the WWE executives? Seriously they wasted so much REAL talent going for the titles. That's another thing the one champion both title thing - just dumb already. So now technically NO ONE is left since every single pay-per-view they just make everyone lose against Roman. USELESS already - WWE SUCKS.
Once again the BIG DOG/HEAD OF THE TABLE/THE CHIEF.. could not win without a cheap shot to the growing or his family helping him win. Acknowledge the truth not tge cheating bloodline
WWE lost me as a viewer last night.   I paid to see it and the last match, while masterfully done by the wrestlers, ruined the experience.  Ultimately, it wasted my time.   Not the best decision, in my opinion, do to its timing, with the company merger being announced overnight.  Even more important is that many folks need something positive right now for multiple reasons, even if it is entertainment.
Well I guess I’m not buying summerslam tickets now. Really thought things would change with HHH in charge. Guess not
At this point Roman is THANOS of the WWE. 😅
Cody Rhodes esta´acabado.
Wwe starting to get bored with roman coward reigns streak all he does sorry all his cousins does his job it's not fair
wwe is working against the will of the public in the world
This result may have also been a business decision. With Endeavor seemingly about to buy WWE, they would want the most profitable arrangement. And there's no question that Roman Reigns is way more of a money draw than Cody Rhodes.
The booking of the finish, has Vince McMahon written all over it. Smdh. Horrible call.
Full year of building this moment and you flicking blew it up.
As sad as I am for Cody not winning, it makes perfect sense because WWE knew we weren’t expecting this.
Scripted
Only 3 people I see beating Roman Reigns. Cody, Bobby and Seth. So now I guess this just leave Bobby and Seth
Only with the help of others can you win, Roman.  You don't deserve those belts!!!
Otra vez Roman, ya basta, ese título era para Cody.. Triple h, por favor deja de engrandecer a alguien que ya tubo su oportunidad, Roman es un buen peleador pero ya deveria dejar su reinado, por que para algunas personas ya le está aburriendo, siempre es lo mismo 😒
This was below the amount of pyro that I hoped for Cody's entrance.
Fraud
Roman Reigns my tribal chief ☝🏼💙
My boyfriend kept telling me how much the ref sucked, and everyone was telling him it’s FAKE!, but rewatching this, I see what he was saying, the refs counts were so off timing.
It’s moments like this that I wish we could see the dislike count
I have never seen Roman wining without cheating means he is the weakest  in WWE.  I have him .wrestling  is not fair.
Cody was robbed.
Roman is the greatest of all time. It's not up for debate.
Usual match ending
Lo único que quiero saber es cuando piensan regresar a Sasha banks, yo la extraño 🥺 quienes la extrañan como yo 👏 quiero verla con un campeonato nuevamente. Y enfrentada a Bianca
Todos perdimos con cody si cameos que caeremos juntos
Shameful can't have a one on one this will come full circle in a cage
L night
The story should've ended...
Roman always cheats
I want new champion... Roman is boring.....
Roman always gets help 😒
만우절 이벤트도 아니고 ........ 하아
I really do think Jey should take it off of Roman , if the bloodline story wasn’t a thing I think Cody would have been perfect but it started with Jey and Roman and I think it should end with them
Y’all messed up. I’ve been watching AEW exclusively since 2019. I’m a lapsed wwe fan largely bc of the propensity of the machine to book against the fanbase. Y’all almost got me back this weekend: Cody last night was the bridge back. Y’all blew up the bridge.
The tribal chief big up my man
Boooooriiiing champ
Wrestling is fake who yall got in izzy vs alex tho?
I swear to god. I bet Triple H booked night 1 and Vince booked night 2.
The world was ready, just not WWE....
So who won?
Roman regins schwach ohne jey uso Jimmy uso und solo silkoa ist er nix ein lappen und er ist ein star da hab ich sogar Mehr drauf haha schwächling😂😊
After watching this I still can’t understand how WWE messed this up.
I cannot believe that Cody left AEW just to become another notch in the belt of Roman Reigns. I no longer watch the WWE, but came back to see Cody ascend to the top of the mountain and make his father proud from beyond the sky. Worst decision ever made since HHH went over Sting at Wrestlmania 31. I like Roman, but he has become a glorified part-timer at this point. They missed THE opportunity to have a "fighting champion" crowned on their biggest show.
He HAD TO WIN IT there was no should....
I was very impressed with the result,,There is no way on this beautiful earth that Cody Rhodes beat Roman reigns everything was just a heat job about Cody and I do not see the hype I think he’s terrible I think he’s selfish and he’s living off his father’s owner he needs to grow a set become his old man
I'm a Roman supporter but titles need to change hands  Cody deserves to win
This was absolutely epic, the entrance from Cody seeing how over he is, this would’ve been the right opportunity to have had him beat Roman, Cody is their biggest babyface right now but this entrance was surreal
Wow what a surprise  he cheats and wins again lol  at this point the script is scripted and them scripted  it's the most predictable thing ever in WWE
Roman Reigns without support can't win ww champion

Wwe messed up making Cody lose all the buildup for a big loss it's not going to feel the same if he wins at the next ppv this is where it needed to happen
Roman is the reason I stopped watching
People really thought Cody was going to win after bro hammered Triple Hs chair on AEW, that man has buried the likes of Booker T & RVD in the past for no reason, you think this mf was going to let that slip 😂😂😂😂
Cody should've won this one wtf is wrong with you HHH?
Roman Sucks!!!
Trashh
That blonde guy reminds me of souther from fist of the North Star
Creio que a Wwe esteja querendo fazer de Roman, uma espécie de Streak nova, revivendo o que foi com Undertaker. Espetacular partida para uma Wwe que vem em decadência mas que tem alguns suspiros de grandes partidas como está. Saudações do Brasil 🇧🇷
Roman can only win by cheating
We’re really in the RomanWinsLol era again..
If not Cody then who? If not at Wrestlemania then when!?
A lot of times people see your mistakes in doing matches do not let some reach a record with those alliances make it as there own to be GOAT
Code next time you come win the next round
soy muy fanatico de roman, pero ya basta. su reinado aburre
SPOILER:     How are we supposed to be invested in a super heel character? Worst than Hogan and Cena. Sami didnt win it and Cody didnt win. Everything was right. But you still pick the wrong guy.Roman had his time. His character is over played.
I was confident WWE was going with the shock-upset finish, but I didn’t expect that there would be an atmosphere of disappointment so heavy.
Reconozcanlo ☝️
Your just favoring roman reigns same as you did to Codys father you did not give the chance bring the belt to the Rhodes family its just the same story nothing changes. So sick of thinking Cody will change the landscape you still have solo and his bros oh come on you make them invinsible wrong move
☝🏼
I was right roman reigns didn't have the testicular fortitude to face Cody Rhodes one on one  without his family's help but Cody Rhodes had the metal to beat the coward roman reigns
Esa lucha la perdió Román
Night 2 was complete dog 💩
Cody go get your stardust costume 😂
Thank you to all the great performers that gave us so Much entertainment last night. You have to learn to appreciate these great entertainers instead of getting upset when your guy/girl doesn’t win. Cody Rhodes doing to his dads move was epic AF
More people wayyyy more deserving than Cody
roman the  always cheating chief
Cody's costume is so mega
I thought it was either Cody or riot but man that was such a good match
Lmao they cut the clips around everyone booing and that guy giving Roman the finger
Had Solo on Raw saying  “Cody…you were not ready” with a smirk then they can start a feud
Common wwe yall know this ain't fair😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Cody is blessed beyond comparison
Back to AEW
It was over already when those pianists starting playing😂final boss vibes right there😎
The like to dislike ratio should tell WWE how everyone feels.
Y’all a fool if y’all thought he was go loos cos the uso lost nd they go get them bk watch
rematch at wrestlemania backlash plssss
Man my personal opinion is this story shouldnt end with cody, it should be ushos. Big things has big ending . Cody isn't the big ending . This started with jay , then jimmy . So thats the whole point
Wwe hate the bullet club 😢
Qué bueno que ganó ROMAN REIGNS👑👑
This was the time to make Cody Rhodes champion. If they do make him champion later it's not gonna be the same sure it will be good but Cody had the build.
oh i cringed a little.
Wins rumble loses at mania after a great build up. Don't worry Cody edge knows how it feels too.
It’s the lex express all over again 🤦🏼‍♂️
Perfect decision. Cody needed to lose big and come back. Him getting handed #30 and winning the rumble wasn't fair. He'll win at SummerSlam.
Momentum is dead
Homelander vs. Thanos. That’s what this was.
Disappointing.  We all expect the Bloodline story line during the week,  but to bring in the cheating at the end in a title match is just disappointing.  The story is getting old already.  Cody should have taken the title.
Now the match was great but Roman winning is kinda questionable but let see how the story continue I feel like he’s going to get his rematch and Sami and Kevin going to make sure Roman does not retain
Seeing fans mark out over Cody losing is seriously one of the best things WWE could hope for. It shows Cody is worth investing in for the long term.   Cody winning for his dad would've been nice but it wouldn't have lasted. Frankly, WWE slowing down and taking their time with Cody means he's going to be their next big face. Cody will get the belt and when he does it will feel more earned, he will be more ready and even though he doesn't get the Mania moment it will be better for him in the long run.
Somebody will overcome roman
☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼
I was rooting for Roman all the way but Cody is definitely the one to dethrone him
Boring...!!
I "Acknowledge" my tribal Chief Roman Reigns.
omg omg this is awesome amazing man THE TRİBAL CHEF
So what now wwe? You missed the perfect opportunity to change the champ. There is no real contender left  except off seth rollins who never lost against Roman
Maybe the biggest troll storyline ever. Amazing.
We even got Kofi Kingston had his Wrestlemania moment, we even had Jinder mahal winning a championship match, but let's not have one of the biggest talents right now have his moment just because we want to protect our dear Boredom Lames, like Cena said since 2017 "you've been protected against anyone and everyone" and that was facts, it's really stupid to me
Wwe Suck's
Too obvious to let cody win
So itz not cody , then who will . I love wwe bcoz they dont need to give everytime expectation . But i believe they have a big plan to end roman's streak . May be career vs career ?? But it should be a something big❤
You can cry all you want, this was so satisfying to me. No way you can give a traitor the top spot. People really thought he'd win lol.
Another year of a part timer holding the belts 😴
دم کودی رود گرم ،مسابقه مردانه و شرافت مندانه،  باخت اما مردانه ، اگر چه خودم طرفدار رومن بودم اما  داشتن طولانی مدت کمربند، او را دچار توهم کرده .
It's absolute bull WWE didn't give Cody the win
You blew it WWE. There was no good reasoning behind Roman retaining the belts here.
I think Cody should have won
Roman always needs outside interference to win.
Cody was robbed 😢
There will be a summerslam rematch that's where cody will win they want roman to hit 1000 days and then cody take it this rivalry is about to be explosive!
CM Punk!
Good to see Roman win 😁
This is getting ridiculous 😒 how come solo didn't get a match at Wrestlemania Which Would Be A Great Question Cody please don't leave I could've swear he could beat Roman again what error did cody do
"In WWE, the story is never over" = "you created AEW and destroyed a throne, did you think you were gonna win?"
I understand why they did this, WWE and HHH think this will elevate both Rhodes and Reigns in the long run. They think it'll rally fans behind Rhodes as he was cheated, while also inflating Roman's "days held count".   However, they're blind to the truth. It has instantly deflated the hype and goodwill HHH built up over the past 6 months. Instead, they recycled the stalest finish they could for the main event of their biggest PPV and blew it massively. Cody is now just another guy, he isn't that face of the company they will no doubt try to pose him as once again come Raw tonight. Any starpower has been washed away by tired booking. All it did was leave a bitter taste in peoples mouths and I rather than cause intrigue in raw tonight, I for one am done with WWE for a bit.   I'll give them credit that they can build a story well enough, but sadly fumble the pay off more often than not. It has been this way for 20 years or more now and any hope this would change with Vince out the picture has been dashed with this latest booking decision.
Cody lost $mh not suprised and shocked at the same time why would they build up Cody up like that’s just to lose the big one if i was wwe I turn Cody into a big heel give these 2 a rivalry and make him win eventually c
Honestly, i wanted cody to win this match, roman doesn’t deserve this at all because he simply can’t win on his own, yes I understand that cody winning here would have been boring but he still got a story to finish, now that sami and kevin won and beat the usos, we have cracks in the bloodline that might show that roman never cared for the bloodline and never helped them win like they do to him. Night 1 was way better than night 2.
Cheater roman reigns
🤡
Personally like the fact Cody didn't go over. I felt like this whole "Bloodline will crumble in 1 night" idea riculous. WWE know that right now this is the hottest storyline they have written in years and will keep it going that bit longer. Also everyone expected cody to win so when Reigns gets the 3 count your hit with the shock of what you expected to happen being swerved the other way.
Bionic elbow made me tear up
my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
Ronda I roman king ty wwe
This time, the people are so upset and disappointed. Fans are so tired of Roman Reigns even if he is good. WWE wants Roman to reign to 1000 days, we think. But the people will love Cody more. And anytime he can become the champ. What can happen in Monday Night Raw? I will ask HHH.
I had a feeling that that was exactly was going to happen, I knew it. And a possibility as well Both sides were gonna help each other with Sami and Kevin helping Cody while the Usos helped Roman And whaddya know, I was right.  P.S Austin Theory cheated and consider him the worstest WWE fighter I have ever seen, and u know I’m right
New Owners probably didn't want cody rhodes to win
I like roman reigns but this was a terrible decision.
Mannn i hate these stupid run on story lines its was Cody’s turn and they knew that nobody wants to see roman champ anymore its getting old everything in wwe nowadays seems to be getting old
So, who's the one who will dethrone Roman? The Rock? I don't think Rock need these titles. Ngl, I really thought Cody is the one
just after 16 seconds or codys entrance i would give him the title.
Acknowledge me!
WILL ANYONE DEFEAT ROMAN REIGNS
Fumbled the bag. We don’t care about Roman. We don’t care about the story. We don’t care about the 1,000 day milestone. WWE has been craving a huge babyface and they fumbled the bag with Sami AND Cody.
It was cody's moment Just awful
I love this song
Ya denle el Titulo de la UFC a Reings también..
Roman gets attacked and Paul Heyman stands still without any sign of anger
This was everything 🙌❤😍
The only good thing about this was Cody’s ring gear .
Roman you👎👎👎👎 Code ❤❤❤
They had the opportunity to please everyone and make new fans everywhere but ruined It all; so disappointing.
The G.O.A.T remains the G.O.A.T.
Came back to Royal Rumble after not watching WWE for 10+ years,just to see the charisma vacuum that is Roman Reigns hold BOTH world titles for 3 years and retaining at WM lmao  You guys have been dealing with this for 3 years? Reigns is boring,he has absolutely nothing special,yet somehow he's being pushed like he's some sort of Hogan/Cena/Rock/Austin 2.0?   Needless to say i'm done with WWE for another 10 years.
Dale roman rey 🙏🙏
This is honestly annoying
Cody was great, both were but i feel like WWE gonna let roman reach 1000 days and then let him lose the titles
Roman menangnya maen keroyokan payah 👎👎👎
Otro año más desperdiciando este evento, ya es muy decepcionante cada año lo mismo, ya da hueva
Let’s be real we all should have seen this coming let’s not forget Cody is the same guy that was once rivals with wwe in aew so did you all really think he was just going to come in and end one of the greatest championship reigns ever and beat a guy who is WWe blue and through think agian this was much expected 💯🔥
As much as I disliked the ending, it did not make sense for Cody to win (at least not yet). He has not earned the title in my opinion. WWE gave him #30 at the rumble...they basically gave him the win. Prior to that, his best match in WWE was vs. Seth. He was great in AEW but he is not at the top in WWE. I can see Roman vs. Cody @ Summerslam with Cody winning which makes sense to me. It gives him a few months to build a story line. Plus, WWE was not going to let Roman loose his streak. Overall, the tribal chief reigns on.
اليوم التاني برعاية ماكمان اكيد عشان طالع بلا سيناريو و كله عك في عك جتكم ستميت نيلة اتحاد خايب
Like always, Roman can't win without help
Roman Reigns crown
WWE was sold today
Hit like it you feel HHH is a stupid clown
This has gone on way too long. What is the point of watching when you give it to Roman over and over until we know he is going to win before it even starts? Of course he can't win without cheating over and over. He can't even win by himself. He's a dirty champion, nothing to be proud of.
So glad roman won  Cody isn’t championship material
Cody suppose to win this, since Solo doesn't have any talent in him he is going to be Roman's puppy forever
WWE IS ACTUALLY TAKING US ALL FOR A EFING RIDE
No wonder Trump managed to become president way back then, Americans love fake.
You can hear the crowd at the end , they really wanted Cody to beat that jobber .
Good game Cody. . .next WWE CHAMPIONSHIP Is you.
Is bored how ended always roman matches
This was just a formality. I’m sure one of Cody’s terms to come back to WWE was to main event a Wrestlemania. He did it. Now, WWE has fulfilled their obligations to his contract. He will remain High-MId-Carder after this! No one wants to see Cody as champ!
So, where to now?
Esta empresa es una mierda, nada más que añadir. Gracias, cody, fuiste lo mejor de la lucha. Tú momento llegara eventualmente.
BOOO!!! Cody has his entire life story cemented in WWE history, to lose to a cheap one shot by Solo??
the right decision.
this video has 42k dislikes just sayin
Great match regardless who won
Aren’t you guys hyped to see Roman do nothing for the rest of the year? 🔥🔥🔥
The right person won! Acknowledge the Tribal Chief Roman Reigns 🎉☝🏽💯👑!!!
What a big waste of storyline. Huge wasted opportunity to do something historical.  So Roman just retains and there is nobody left to beat him, great.  Sami couldn't do it and now not even Cody was able to achieve it on Wrestlemania and there prob won't be a better moment to beat Roman. Good Job
Nice acting 😂
Román reings sin duda es buen luchador, pero esas victorias amañadas  por la ayuda de sus primos a muchos seguidores no nos convence. Déjenlo que haga su lucha sólo y que gane el mejor.
They don't want a solo vs Cody feud for the title so they had to have Roman win plus he's going for the 1,000 day mark
Came here to thumbs down. Absolutely stupid business.
NO 1 RR vs Dusty son very nice match
The match is very sad
This is why I don’t like wwe they rig is terrible
WWE fukn blew it last night....this WAS Codys MOMENT!!
Can’t just have a guy like Cody who left the business and come back and beat the main guy. You guys are upset because he lost oh well, he didn’t deserve to win.
I hate Roman Reigns you did good Cody.
Can the WWE institute a rule that referees ignore anyone outside the ring that is not one of the combatants? That takes away the "but the ref didn't see it" angle when shenanigans are afoot. The trouble with the ref didn't see it angle is this: there have been matches in the past where someone won the match using less than honorable tactics that somehow the ref missed, or the ref was knocked out. Not every occasion but there were instances of the GM running down the ramp saying no, that's not how this match ends and orders a match restart. Just a bit of consistency would be good. You can call me Mark, I guess
"If you think the grass is so greener on the other side, be my guest. Go ahead, leave. Main event Night 4 of a buy-one-get-one-free extravaganza and then get released faster than you last in the sack."
Roman is nothing more than a cheap copy of his cousin the Rock.
Now it's time for the new 4 horsemen with a rko as the leader
Can we see The Rock vs Roman for the championship and for the right to be called the head of the table
Soooo what u telling us is that roman could never win on his own...he always needs help?ya'll showing him like a coward
People saying this was Cody's moment, no it wasn't. It felt too forced. He'd been missing the entire year and only just came back to win the Rumble. Didn't do enough to down a 900+ day title reign. Roman got a dirty win, it was perfectly done. The only person now left to down Roman, is Solo Sikoa.
Con esto, ya puedo saber que WrestleMania XL será una absoluta locura 😊
How are you gonna show clips from the match but don't show how it ended??....Trash
same boring story wwe pulls with roman cheating every match.. I knew he would win cause same boring story from the cheater roman and wwe... im finished watching wwe now... this was the final straw of this scam matches from roman and wwe... lots people are tired of this now so bye for good ill rather watch a tree grow then this boring old scam story that stuck on repeat...
Cody forever loser
La wwe tenía que dale el Título a Cody ya Román aburre
Why don't you let coded roc win, you monkey, you Buzi, you kucsa
que difícil es ganar si la viven ayudando a romanita 🙄🙄🙄😡😡😡
Lost the only chance to give Roman a meaningful loss
Boring roman.... Overrated
Awful finish
Maybe Cody will never get this hype and momentum ever again  Definitely a Big Mistake
Honestly i think it was a great heel thing for roman to win it was Cody's moment but let's see what happens
Speechless! Terrible ending. Painful
bro the usos just had too interfere
Cody going win the title at summer slam it ready plan.
Fumbled the bag with Drew, then Sami, now Cody. This the worst one of them all. Roman Sammartino gotta go 💤

The fact y’all are online crying and moaning about how mad you are or “you guys blew it” or how you’re not watching…   Are the reason last night played out the way it did. Roman didn’t win the WWE title the very first time he challenged for it. Grow up. It’s called story telling. Y’all remember Daniel Bryan beating Cena at SummerSlam and immediately losing the belt? Smh y’all will still be watching when Cody finally does win the championship. Quit your bitching.
This match was awesome
Terrible choice to have Roman retain. I think we're all just about sick of this bloodline story but having said that the match was very very good
This is The Island of Relevancy and There is No body Can Stop The Tribal Chief, The Head of The Table Thé King of The Bloodline , It's Time For Cody To Acknowledge Roman Reigns
Shut your mouth 😂
sucks that they buried cody
It was codys moment man
في كل مباراه ينقذونه ا.سلالته.  هذ ا ظلم . وعار..
I tuned in to see Cody go over. I will not tune back in ever again. Every match sucked and WWE missed their opportunity with this one.
Vince is a psychic vampire who gets off on crushing morale. Hope his timje is near.
Ey man we don't wanna see this.
Roman reigns cannot win a match without Unless he has help from his friends I think his title should be taken away and cody Roads should get another shot at the title And the whistle should not be involved. Make it a h*** in the cell so roman has no place to run or get help from his friends
Solo sikoa asist
Cody is the best wwe
WWE HATES THEIR FANS.
بنظري ونظر كل العالم رومن رينز.  خسر . ف راس المنيا.  رومن ليس اسطوره . الاسطوره ان تدافع عن لقبك.  لوحدك.  وتثبت أن بطل..  عار ثم العار.  . علي هذا الظلم ..
match was fgreat but gosh i can`t believe it they let Roman to retain again, was the perfect moment to break his historic reign. Match was so coherent for making Cody win. Solo's interruption again when he was ejected before it's too much for me i think. No doubts Roman has been great for WWE, but i think it's too much that he retained again. I guess we all expected Cody to win and i guess that could be the thing why wwe surprised us with another Reigns victory, who no doubts it's a better heel wrestler than face as he was for long time. I hope at Backlash outcome it's another if not, will seems that Reigns will always be champion. I Think if somebody deserved to take Roman's title was Cody for his long time at WWE, and i thought with the Royal Rumble win all looked good for Cody. I hope at next main event Cody does it. I don't know how much more WWE can give to Roman
C-mon Wwe NEED A New Undisputed Champion, Cody Was The Number One Option.
Only way to match the hype is to do it at next year’s Mania and who wants another year of Roman holding up both titles…
Cheating Roman fake Roman 😡
The world collectively groans and walk out knowing Vince is back.
Nah bro this got ridiculous.
We're in the endgame now.
👎
Fumbled this...
ENOUGH ROMAN MORE CODY
Ima be honest with everyone to keep watching them let Roman win gets old that’s why I quit watching. I was happy to see Cody come back and win but probably won’t happen with Vince back
Roman can't be stopped
I wanna ask you a favor. Someone please tell me when roman reigns loses because I intend to quit watching WWE since this Stobid company intend to create Roman's streak like undertaker's but something bigger may be till Roman retires or pass away so I won't and anyone won't enjoy watching matches he knows its results for the next twenty years so WWE thanks for removing the suspense element from your content and you can enjoy watching your own content because no one will.
Yes WE THE ONES ☝🏾🩸break all people’s hope against us
This feels like one of those moments where Vince and Triple H were just too prideful to let the guy associated with the competition beat the loyal WWE guy on the big stage.
One thing with championship matches at Aew  wrestling you get good contested awesome matches hardly any interference always one on one All Elite rocks.
U can see the emotion in Cody’s face when he’s with his family n likes son
Cody rhoades forever
Wm 40 Roman vs seth vs cody
So happy he won
☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽
Roma nadama gana asi con trampa el mano a mano no le gana a nadie
Dumb decision
L
Y’all tripping best decision wwe made, no more feel good moments. Plus I was going for Cody
Cody deserves better and I hope he gets it, let’s not forget all the work he put it before leaving and making himself a bigger star.
2 people getting buried in 2 nights first Dom now Cody.
Cody should’ve won 😡
dawg is always winning with help💀
Now since cody rhodes lost he we probably lose all of that momentum
Mann Cody looked sad. We love you Cody, Like Big match Jon would say Never Give up!!!!!
You smashed the throne, you made BTE videos poking fun at him, you even copied the WCW invasion angle and you marks still expect him to win?? Triple H is petty and vindictive
We wrestling fans are tired of seeing Mr Reigns defend seccesfully his championship with the help of his family, some time the Uso brothers or the lone one. We hope that in some moment WWE will understand that this can not go on for more time because fans can get fedup. Roman Reigns defend your title but ONE ON ONE!
I mentioned this in another post. It's risky not to put the belt on Cody while he is hot, but possible they are going for the Rocky to Rocky 2 storyline either at Summer Slam but probably Wrestlmania 40. It's very risky if Cody doesn't gain any more momentum and even riskier if he loses momentum before then.
That was a horrible end.
wwe sucks now
Yeah god mode! But he needs help all the time to win! I don’t see how people say he’s the greatest I’m glad the usos lost! I wish he did too!
It was sad watching my little boys crying sad thinking they where gonna see a new champion instead of a same old cheater winning lol oh well I try my best telling them it’s only fake they just want money from ppl lol 😂
Biggest fake champion ever shameless sure he got some secret videos of vince and triple h to let him get away all this time five people champion not one
👎
WE DON'T WANT ROMAN ANYMORE. THAT'S ENOUGHHHHH
Prime Jim Ross would've had a heart attack calling this 😂😂😂
Surprised Cody lost , now hoping reigns will face Gunther
This is why nobody takes wwe serious
Roman is the best
Cody ,solo 😪😈
Acknowledge ROMAN REIGNS 👏
Having a part time universal champ hurts the buildup and the show.   Loved the entrances, just wish the build up was better.
Solo is gonna finish the story
7:15  by mistake they played Roman reign old theme song lol
This finish was so obvious,im disappointed Who knew the main event was gonna be the worst match on the show
Lame Cody should’ve won I’m tired of Roman being the champ lol
We the 1s!!!!!
It was predictable. Usos losing and then coming to the aid of Reigns to prove their loyalty.
Roman didn't look like he liked the finish either. Probably felt horrible for Cody.
I will no longer watch a single match Roman is involved in until he loses because we all knew his little chihuahuas out to help him win. I get the whole concept behind the heel but you’ve gotta be kidding me. WWE is gonna mess around and lose viewers because we’re all tired of this garbage. The rest of WrestleMania was great except for this debacle. Nice job WWE!
Roman can never win without help!!!
Well, I'm done with WWE now. Guess it's time to give AEW a shot.
WWE just raised Romans Reigns Heel Stock even more. The rematch will garner even more hype and complete a awesome story🎉
Fk that! Cody should’ve won!
The crowd though.
Cry cry and cry some more. And still 😁☝️
Both same age
WWE NEEDS TO PUT CODY ON THE MAP THEY OWE IT TONHIA DAD AND HIS BROTHER
Pathetic ending. Cody won imo.
You Roman winning cheating is getting really old
You guys need to stop being marks and just keep watching 🤦🙄
It was never Cody time stop crying and waning…. It was it is and it will be always My Tribal chief Roman Reigns time . Period
Roman Reigns is truly the final Boss! You have to acknowledge him! Great Match!
So Roman Reigns is gonna be champion forever? Im gonna have to take a break from wrestling. Thank God for the 2k game cause the real wwe is stale.
I will make a bet with anyone that they will bring back starrcade because dusty made it and that’s where Cody will have his moment
For all the people saying it was Cody’s time, you guys are just wrong. Cody’s been undefeated since he returned but he hasn’t really earned the title yet. Roman’s been the MOST DOMINANT wrestler today for about 4 years now, and it just wouldn’t make sense for Cody to return and defeat Roman after all of Roman’s dominant defenses. Cody will probably get it soon, but not at Wrestlemania. 🤷🏽‍♂️💯
When roman reigns dhows up, wwe is winning
Cody should have won. He was the one to defeat roman but solo once again screw it all. I hate this guy so much right now
Grateful for the long reign, grateful for the match. But the wrong person won, it makes no sense for Roman to have retained from a storyline standpoint. I know they want him to break the record, but what now? At this point Gunther should be the one who finally takes both titles at summer-slam.
It's a trash ending, keep going and I'm sure that soon enough I'll stop watching wwe .
It doesn't make any sense it just doesn't I truly don't understand the booking of the ending for this match usually I keep my mind a little open  and I understand but this one i truly don't why did Roman need this reign if cody had won tonight that would've boosted him to the top coming back from an injury winning the royal rumble competing week after week on raw and for what?? Absolutely nothing??? Vince has to be back because trips would never book it like this
Please dislike this video, Cody deserved this win
5:24 is the best moment I’ve ever seen! The hype was unreal for that spear!!!
Is Vince back? This was a tragedy of a writing
Wwe is officially dead
I popped so hard when Roman won. I'm not even a Reigns fan but that goes to show how much I dislike Cody. Never thought I'd ever say it but...I Acknowledge Roman☝️ Also I was very disappointed that Balor lost, as well in Edge for not once putting JD and Balor over during their feud, but Cody not winning definitely made up for it to some degree. Still disappointed but at least the show ended on a high note for me
Bro 😭😭 It was codys night
YALL MAD OR NAH🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸
Roman everytimee😌♥️
Cody go back to AEW....
Brodie ❤
Roman always cheat to win like Sami cody
Acknowledge him!
Fire Roman.
Ugh when is this guy going to lose the tittles
I like Braun to take the trap from Roman, at summer slam or survivor series.
Having Solo their made it too obvious. Despite that this Wrestlemania was awesome.
Yeah, I feel like they dropped the ball here. Last night was the night that Roman should have been dethroned. If not Cody Rhodes, who will dethrone Roman Reigns? Are they really holding out for The Rock to beat Roman? Are they gonna give us another part time champion? I say let Cody win the Money in the Bank so he can challenge Roman again.
Haha his daughter throwing off the headphones. That's awesome!
0:19 Everyone's favourite part
E Drones are punyetas
I'm so done with roman reigns,people complain that John cena was a 5 Moove pony,so is roman without mic skills 😂
It is clear to me that Roman Reings is the company's consent, he can never just need help to win, the fights from before where it was only one on one are missed
Cody went all the way, just to lose to Roman, shame🥺😞😠
רומן ריינס הוא זבל
I wish the WWE would read the comments the people us as fans of WWE are tired of Roman and want him gone !
Even when Brock was champion, he never needed any help from anyone but every time Roman reigns gets help and yet he calls himself the greatest of all time. This is just so messed up honestly. There should be a rematch in hell in a cell
I thought LA Knighy was gonna win MITB, but after that I think Cody wins it
WWE kid show lol
Cody got me interested in WWE again for the first time since the fiend vs Seth in hell in a cell ruined it for me and then this is the outcome of one of the easiest and perfect story lines lmao this feels like they wanted to swerve everyone to show draft kings you can bet on this product smh
Denuevo la perrita no pudo sola😂
Wwe Always disaponting fans
WWE time is lose
They've just jumped the shark with this one
If They would have told Romans brother thugs to stay out of that ring he would have lost🤣🤣🤣🤣now cage match
👎🏻
Когда кончится нечестно😪😪😪😪😪😪😢😭
I was watching the match on TV but roman reigns returns so who is the new wwe universal champion
Как всегда подло😪😪😪😪😢🥵😭😭😭
Welp WWE you suck again..
I cannot stress how much of a miss-step this was
This singular wrestling between Cody and Reigns has made me quit watching wrestling. This is totally unacceptable. The wwe univeerse should return the belt to Cody because he actually won. The match was rigged or staged. Rubbish.
Someone please have the bug where you can see the dislikes for this video!
I got 4 words for ya… Cody should have won….
Cody🎉🎉🎉

BOOOOOOO!!!!
Cody should of won roman  can never win alone worst ending ever
I know people are upset but this is a set up for great story telling and it's gonna start with this upsetting loss as his first WM event. I'm curious to see what unfolds for Cody next  Amazing main event  This could become a potential showcase in future WWE2K games as well
A little ironic considering everyone thought WM 31 would be Reigns’ big title win, only to have it taken away from him—the difference being that nobody really wanted Reigns to win in the first place and there was actually an exciting twist and people actually liked how it ended.
It was Cody's time. A chance for WWE to crown a new megastar and they blew it. SMH.
Acknowledge your tribal chief and cry us a river ☝🏼 , cody will one day finish the story and win the title yall quit acting like this was the only shot he will get , i know roman will lose soon maybe after 1,000 days maybe summer slam at the moment he is doing the job getting yall to hate him and i love it the perfect heel, also why doesn’t any one bring up bobby lashley ? He has everything to defeat roman but no one even pits him in the picture, we the ones ☝🏼
I never assumed that roman wins
TIRED OF THE TRIBAL CAVEMAN
WWE sucks again. Almost thought it was a good company. Obviously we have bimbos running the company
Roman Empire being ruler for a long time in the past 😂
Cody rhodes ? Is he Lana's cousin or brother something like that?
The WWE scriptwriters really need to give it up. Roman has been a great bad guy but the Bloodline now is redundant and quite frankly boring: I know heel champions bring more viewers but let a storyline vanish when it has died already.
Had goosebumps as Cody emulated Dusty Rhodes. Absolutely disappointing ending of what was overall a very fun wrestlemania.
Even though the ending is questionable. The match was a five star classic. Everything from the entrances to the storytelling to the match brutality of the match was on point.
THE RIGHT MAN WON
So Cody lost Cena lost most people wasn't expecting Cena to come back full-time was this a great wrestlemania all the building up Cody they could of least let him win the title at mania
Righteous
Cody fans cry more Roman Reigns is still the king 🤴
Roman should thank his  cousins for being champion for this long
I understand why they had Roman retain. He's so close to 1000 days which is going to give him something easy to sell for the rest of his career. They also probably didn't want to rock the boat too much just ahead of a sale. And having Cody steamroll to the title after starting up a competitor isn't exactly a great look for the brand. I still think it was the wrong choice though. And it has nothing to do with Romans ability or Cody or the story. The wrong choice was putting both titles on a part timer in the middle of a historic run. This diminishes the rest of the roster and makes the week to week product worse overall. Sure, Roman and the bloodline are compelling. But everyone else seems so far beneath him that it puts a cap on how interesting any of their stories can be. And those stories can't be elevated with heavyweight title stakes because Roman is holding them both hostage. I really hope they get the titles off him or split them again somehow asap. Roman is an awesome heel. But there are other awesome performers on the roster and I'd like to see what high stakes stories they can tell that don't involve the bloodline.
You can tell listening to Michael Cole that WWE cares more about breaking records and numbers above anything else. Should've seen this coming.
Roman is always the tribal chief.
I truly wished Cody won, he deserved that win
Roman Reigns is the king of near falls.
I could dislike this a million times. This was a worser decision than ending the streak 🤦‍♂️ Everyone would’ve tuned in on Monday to see Cody. NO ONE CARES ABOUT ROMAN. I’m definitely not watching that garbage that’s been shoved down our throats for 8 years
I’ve never been so mad at WWE ever
That might of been the worst Wrestlemania ending I've ever seen
This and the asuka match only thing that disappointed me whole weekend
"You brought hard times on the American Nightmare Cody Rhodes bayba"
roman wins again,its getting BORING now 😴
Wow the crowd sounded dead
This was Cody's time. Why WWE?! It was an amazing story with an amazing match that ended very badly. This was the perfect night for a change. The stage and the crowd were there. The story was there. How can I believe in cody rhodes ever again? Even if he wins it later, it's going to be obvious, and the hype will be already gone. There's no one left to beat this dude. The only way to make him lose is by pinning himself or relinquishing the titles.
Just came her to dislike. Didn’t even watch it
Now we have a guaranteed 60 days of Roman reigns & B tier PPVs. Thanks WWE you told your fans to stop watching!! Congratulations.. you played yourselves.
Cody should have won the match . It's really super boring to see the same thing happen during a title match.
Lol WWE blows it again. Trash 🗑️
Wild how almost 1000 days in Roman can't beat Cody 1 on 1. Makes him look weak. Top guy need ref bumps and backup interference every match. Can't carry a company clean.
Everyone keep disliking the video
Hey dude. I’m bored of same champion, same match in advantageous of number of people. I wish middle-rank wrestlers (like Shinsuke and Balor) have more opportunity to get a title. And the part-time mic performer Roman should become a wrestler.😞
A pergunta é quando o campeão universal vai ganhar uma luta sozinho??? Ele será capaz de vencer só ou empre precisa de ajuda? Deveria ter sem interferência...
Aknoledge the tribal chief
Never seen a quiet crowd at the end of a Champion title match.
WWE was trending up. Serious momentum. Now it’s straight downhill. Pure garbage again. Total WWE move, not surprised. No one is tuning into raw to watch Roman trash Reigns & Austin trash Theory, then Friday we get boring Gunther!! Yaaay! WWE took such a L on night 2 it’s disgusting. No one will care about Cody winning at summer slam 🤮 this was it. Y’all blew it.
We hope the next time cody all New champion
What is WWE even trying to do here? What is the point of hyping challengers vs Reigns if we all know it comes down to the same outcome of him winning with interference, and killing all the hype? What a joke of a championship rein(no pun intended). This is getting old.
WWE and UFC will do a huge event where roman will lose to Cody or he loses at SummerSlam.
best main event i’ve ever watched
It could have been embarrassing Rhodes pinning the tribal chief.
We like cody
If it’s not Cody at least I would like to see a rematch with Seth Rollins even tho it was a DQ ending
love codys entrance music, gets never old. He deserved a win.
The Bloodline are talented and all but we need something new. It's been the same schtick for three years in a row now.
the ending quality is exactly why i stopped watching years ago
so...at wrestlemania backlash...the story wil end with cody as champion...for sure!!
Thx wwe you ruined
what is this wwe get your heads well
Hicieron trampa como siempre, son unos corruptos
way to kill the fans hopes and dreams. I will not be watching Raw
Buuuuuuuuuuu
What a dumb finish... this is my legacy, I have to finish the story.... Solo get banned from ring comes back and bring Roman the win. Typical predictable wwe story telling... unnecessary dragging the story on ...
Not gonna lie . Having the same champion for more than 2 years is getting boring now . Good match though🎉
Cody was suppose to win AT MANIA that was suppose to be the ending of Cody fairy tale . Not no damn long story telling  I can’t believe wwe fumbled that Cody had all the tools ! Guess it was to good to be true
L
lol chody congrats Roman Seth will beat you one day if not soon he will be the one to take ur title considering the fact that youve never pinned him. Just pray he doesnt win Money in the bank if he does watch ur back
Cody se lo debes a Toni kan AEW te hiso
Sheep.  This is good storytelling.  No Cody didn't get it done last night.  How would it look if the longest champ lost in their first bout clean?  Don't believe me?  How about when Lesnar broke Taker's streak?  Exactly.  No it needs to be bigger than that.  It needs Jey to be in a position to help Roman, and doesn't.
This is such garbage every time you think the WWE  make the right turn Triple H turns 's the WWE back 35 years
All this talk about finish the story, but yet never having the story defined.   Then HHH is in the Mania post press conference saying the story never finishes at WWE.   Does anyone see this being fucken ironic ?!?!?!?!  Big L for Cody not going over.
"Damn" Devin Booker -2021
WWE King 👑 Roman Reigns very power,,,
imagine fumbling the bag at wrestlemania.
Roman reings es el jefe tribal ☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️❤
They wasted such a great moment just for a classic roman interference finish
Look, I like Roman Reigns.  I do. He's  raw. He's  rough around the edges. He broods.  He's  got his schtick down pat and it works.   But to have him have the title for 1000 days has become boring to me.  When you can pretty much guess who is going to win because of revenues/advertising/expectations,doing the "same ol' same ol' of predictability" then it's  a slippery slope downwards.   JMO.
Cody was better than roman
☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾
Everyone moaning about Cody are stupid, this is what made wwe good, you all thought and was adamant Cody gonna be champ and for once wwe gave you a surprise you didn't see coming and you're all moaning. Cody is overated and a snake, about time an underdog gets a title shot, not the same wrestlers over and over and over again
Yeah it was a given, that they wasn't going to allow Cody to take the belt.
Roman Reigns won again. Because solo Sikoa got Cody when he was rejected by the referee it was Cody's moment. But now it's gone too different, this sucks if they make a story and they pull up the replays of what happened then it could be a chance that Cody will be wanting a rematch
Let’s rebel
The big dog 👊💪🤜✊
☝️
I don’t think this built the hype they wanted for this Cody vs Roman rivalry. It more so just soured that ending. The worst part is if Cody does get a win over   Roman at later ppv, it won’t get as big of a reaction as it would have at the grandest stage of them all.
Nobody can stop our tribal Chief.  ☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼
why roman 😢 again
Epic.   Crushed outta the park.  Fantastic.
For everyone all butt hurt about Cody not winning, the story has just begun, there are more chapters to write before it ends! Due to that Cody winning last night would not have made sense! This match was brilliant, these two have great chemistry together! Lets just ride the wave and let this unfold how it may!
Can he really be called undisputed, when he does not win clean in any match. This had vince's hands all over this. Roman asking for anybody to beat him, hell everybody has BUT he gets the cheap interference win. Oh well typical WWE.
WWE has been so good the past year, then this happens and idk. I'm just conflicted. I felt like this was Codys moment forreal. I'll see where this leads for a few weeks to determine if it was the wrong call. But I also can't lie that I went to bed feeling a bit disappointed.
LETS GO ROMAN WON
So you sacrifice Drew in his home country to further the title reign, fine. You do the same with Sami in Montreal, fine. Now you have the biggest Babyface that the company hasn’t seen in ages who literally is on Cena-type levels of Babyface right now and is the best answer to WWE’s biggest heel right now, and you take that away as well. What are you thinking, WWE?
Y’all remember Triple H’s reign of terror? This is Roman Reigns reign of terror but worse 😭
Really should have gave it to Cody.....boo to wwe
Roman reings  es un maldito cobarde SIN AYUDA NO ES NADA
Roman should’ve lost that match, will Cody get another chance at the undisputed World universal championships?
Kevin Sammi and Cody really thought they broke the bloodline 😌☺️☝🏽they not on the Royal Samoan family level
Cody is the true winner last night
Why does cody reminds me off homelander from the boys
Triple threat between Connor McGregor, Jon Jones and Roman Reigns for the Unified WWE UFC Multiversal championship
They literally threw away months of build up and the most organic Babyface pop they could've gotten just to make sure Vince's boy doesn't lose at Mania foh
Good match, gave a lot of emotions. But, the ending... I would call it a Hollywood Screwjob. So much like Vince's style...
Solo is the ultimate enforcer
Seriously. He won again. It’s a mystery why I don’t watch anymore. What a joke
God mode 24/7
Roman loses his title exactly on 1000 days there is a pay per view on may 27th -king of the ring and queen of the ring
Drop the ball on this one💀
It was Cody's moment. You didn't strike while the iron was hot. To say it was a missed opportunity would be a massive understatement.
If anyone does beat Roman it should be Jey USO after all he's been through after all Roman has done to him Jey deserves it more than anyone else even more than cody
If it wasn't all fixed for money, Cody would have won
They had Cody give all those passionate promos about him finishing his story, just for him to lose in the end 🤦🏾‍♂️…  Atp he could win it tonight and it would be great.. but it wouldn’t hit the same. WrestleMania was supposed to be his time!!
WWE is boring now. Reigns not the greatest to do it when he gets help most of the time in his matches, it was Cody’s time not another win for reigns. The script is boring having him win all the time. Got a feeling he’ll never lose due to the boring script
Don't mistaken ppls hate for roman as "heat" he's just unbearably predictable and boring. If it's on the mic, in the ring or even in backstage segments. The story is stale, we are no longer entertained by roman. Everyone had their hopes on a new FULL TIME champion and a return of a good belt design. Not to mention our investment didn't pay off. I know you'll play it off as heat but it's really not. He's played out. It's time for him to go to Hollywood.
Y'all really acting like Cody didn't disrespect wwe and triple h at aew now y'all want him to hold the titles like nothing happened he needs to start at the back of the line other superstars deserve a chance before him
Cody got cheated out of that match big time, he should’ve won that but Roman can’t get the job done on his own
1000 day reign
And now Cody chapters are complete
Good match but knew the outcome, it was becoming to obvious that Cody was going to win it was more of a foregone conclusion that they were going to take the belts off reigns at Mania so I think they decided to swerve and play out the storyline just a little bit further, I still think he's going to drop them to Cody either at the next PPV or after just sucks they denied him that WrestleMania moment
Roman is the man. Like it or not
I feel like Dean Ambrose about to come for the title might have to be a triple threat with Seth another match that can happen since the usos lost they titles jey can turn on Roman and win against Roman
This company.
This man keeping the belts til WrestleMania 100 at this point
They really dropped the ball hard this time. Cody should've won, it was the perfect time and matchup for Roman to drop the title.
Our Tribal Chief ☝🏼
Well... this was almost as stupid as giving roman the titles in the first place... so forced... so boring... shouldn't be wwe anymore... should be Samoan Wrestling Entertainment.
Reigns is eating all those finishers and it all takes one thumb & spear to pin cody rhodes
Im sorry but cody has been hyped up too much. His character and promos are based on others. He uses dusty. He uses the solo is not ready when John Cena used it against Austin Theory. Cody is more of like soulja boy. Comes and goes. Roman Reigns I respect more because he has performed against bigger name wrestlers. Roman only left because Leukemia and even then was wrestling with the illness. It wasnt beneficial but he kept wrestling. Cody only shows up when it benefits him like if hes a big shot like the rock, cena, batista which are way better. Cody is more of a low tier wrestler sorry. He doesnt wrestle that good. His character and promos are copy paste and weak. Its like sami zayn. He has good promos. But his wrestling is a bit sloppy. His airborn moves are great though. With this loss Cody will go into hiding once again. American nightmare is not the right character for him. Hes more of a runner. American Nightmare would suit someone like kurt angle or Edge who are great performers. Codys american nightmare character is as bad as trumps reign for office. Both were truly americas nightmares. All talk and no action. Or weak decisions.
I personally think Cody should have won the match because this was his moment, he deserved to win. Roman Reigns has been champion for a while and honestly I think someone else deserves it and that should have been Cody. I know it’s all scripted and everything but without help Roman Reigns cannot win. He plays his part good and everything but it’s just so annoying and it makes me sad at the same time because i have been most excited for this match. I would love to see a rematch with Cody, and Reigns but with no help just 1 vs 1. (Btw I hate Paul Heyman so much and the rest of the bloodline)
Cody deserves better
Cody deserve it more
Now its obvious cody is going to win those titles at backlash
Sick and tired of Roman. Not ever watching a Roman match again.
☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝
i laughed so hard when he got pinned😂
I’m okay with Cody losing, I just don’t like how they did it in the same old predictable way, help from his family. They should have tried something new like have Dustin come back, presumably to help Cody, but then he turns on him in the match to help Roman, and it’s later revealed he’s jealous his brother is getting the title push he didn’t get. Of course Dustin’s signed with AEW so that wasn’t happening, but come on, you gotta try something new.
Same old result. Wwe really know how to become predictable. It should have been Cody Rhodes becoming champion. You can’t have a champion for almost four years it becomes boring.
Roman's beating Sammartino's record.
Adrenaline in my soul jobbed to Roman Co Dy Rhodes
YEEEE
When was the last time Roman won a match on his own?
vince is back knew it when shane came out cody deserved better
The longer they wait to give Cody the title, the bigger the impact it will be. Just like with Daniel Bryan.
Oh god, i'm so tired of this booking.
Triple h saying the story doesn't end just writes a new chapter. That new chapter better not be written for anyone else but Cody at this point, we had austin, rock and hhh battling it out for years for the title. So to bring in a story arch about the Rhodes family legacy for him to fall short better not end. The story needs to continue in a redemption phase.
This was Cody's moment even if he lost. Where does he go from there if he won? This is a huge moment for him won lose or draw. Nothing to be ashamed of, he is now in a different tier of wrestler than ANY of his peers in aew with the exception of day Danielson.
Whoever writes these scripts does a good job but the end often sucks. Cody should have walked out with the title.. you may let Roman get it back in a rematch 😊
Cody sucked at  WWE and when he was at AEW. So happy he lost , i wished it would have been a squash match.They already buried Seth for him although Seth is a much better wrestler
Can’t win without help as long as he has those goons with him he will never lose
My only problem for this ending why Cody  If Roman was already going to win wrestlemania then  what was the point of Cody winning the rumble  Why did the USOS lose the tag titles the night before WWE did Cody Rhodes wrong for not giving him the moment he deserved
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Biggets fraud in history 😂😂😂 not even Cena was protected this much 😂 but hey, Gotta make Roman look strong 😂
In rock family only rock is lion and have legacy other are 😂😂😂😂😂 joker…
Cry Cody fans Cry harder
Roman can’t win without help. As mad I am about the finish they did this to progress the story. They most likely want Roman to hit 1000 days as champion. So at summerslam in July cody gets his rematch where he finally gets the win & gets the championship. If  Roman holds the title until summerslam he will have the 5th longest reign of a world champion in 35 years. He will surpass Pedro Morales reign of 1,027 days. I think that’s where the story is going. Roman passes that then he drops the title. The Rhodes family legacy finally receives the one championship that has been dawned on them.
Pathetic ending.
This is the perfect example of a wasted talent. Cody busted his EVERYTHING and still lost. The match was crazy, but only because of Cody.... But Roman proved that he is still an overrated lame, who only has 3 movesets but at least his family is wealthy and multi-generational, so he always has to be the champion because that is what money is all about for the devils that run this industry....
As bad as the finish was, I think it’s safe to say this is still one of the best main events in WrestleMania history
Sya memaki ni terus smpai cody rhodes menang bru sya berhenti memaki..bagus kc menang tu cody rhodes klo tidak tk akan berhenti memaki!!!!!faham ka vince McMahon haaaaaaa
HE CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT
I gotta say, Roman reigns is the goat of all WWE.
Seth and Roman suck
This would be one of the worst ending of wrestlemania So they think the 'part-time champ' is 'best for business' I think it wouldn't be easy to make the storyline better
Cody will never mean as much as he could've now and Roman couldn't have meant less or more regardless of outcome. This was dumb. Even if he eventually wins over Roman, it won't mean as much. I can already feel myself caring even less as I type this. Booo. And not the good kind.
Yall really don't understand storytelling if you're genuinely upset about the finish. If anything would've helped Roman get over as a baby face early it would've been a clean dominant loss to Brock at 31.  By losing the biggest match of his career, and getting it taken by Solo, that elevates Cody to another level with a mountain to climb even though they've made him look like a world beater and he went out on his shield in this match. It elevated Solo to an important singles competitor. The climb to Roman only started when he won the Rumble. Roman is the hottest heel wrestling has seen in a long time. Gotta keep adding the elements to the story if Cody's gonna win.
I couldn't have been happier to see Roman win.  I thought for sure that Cody would win. Its nice to be surprised when you have watched wrestling for 4 decades.
3 biggest Wrestlemania Disappointments:  1. Asuka Losing Raw Women’s Championship Match 2. Gunther Retaining 3. Cody losing 😢
Cody winning would be best for business but vince has to screw everything up and make roman look strong. massive let down
Another cheating fight
We don't beat a boss final easily
Roman cant win fairly. End of story.😂
Sya tk berpuas hati selagi cody rhodes tk menang tu belt
Og course Roman reigns cheated but Usos lost made my year congratulations kevin Owens and Sami Zayn tag champions cheaters never win Usos Cody summer slam Rey Mysterio beat His disobedient son Dominique
Pengacau betul,kc singkir ba dia tu,sya mau cody rhodes menang dan dpt tu wwe undisputed Universal champion...
Homelander vs Aquaman
People doesn't understand that Cody is not on Roman's level
Román Rey siempre gana ayuda de alguien Román Rey no sabe nada
If Cody can't beat the tribal chief, who it's gonna be ? Mox ? A return at RAW ? Freakin' CM Punk ?
Two low -carders fighting for the biggest prize?
It's time to get rid of Roman, it's getting really old. Time for AEW. The only way they let him when so much is he has to cheat. Great lessons for kids.
It' official They're going for a 1400+ days reign of terror...
The horrible decision just to get to 1000
Samoan Wrestling Entertainment...
Solo sikoa bagus ko p mati la
@romanreigns should remain undefeated with those titles until he retires so he can leave with the titles & leave a record & @wwe can finally update their titles making them better looking & unique from each other.
Sya tk puas hati cody Rhodes kalah bru dengan cara begitu
Roman Reigns is the better champion.
bad ending
Done with this
yo hhh actually blew it wtf
Not every story has a happy ending. The question is after this, who will stop this reign?
The way Roman sold that Cody cutter
I Not Happy now
And still your undisputed champion…. Romaaaaannn!! Reingssssss!!! Love to see it ❤
and for the fact, tribal chief is still running, and that best for business
The finish was loose adaptation of the HHH Vs Sting Wrestlemania Match.
What I don't understand is this: why wasn't there someone to deal with Solo? There is going to be hostility tonight on RAW, and I am scared.
I want a rematch between Cody Rhodes vs roman reign,im not very Happy That roman winning Like That,i want cody To defeat roman reign at wrestlemania backlash..if wwe Dont, I want To stop watching wwe.
Disappointing ending. Bloodline bores
So basically Roman title defend match goes like this  His and the Opponent build up fight, Finisher, Roman kick out 2.9 His opponent have good opportunity to win Interrupted by Paul/Bloodline Roman do that rebound rope spears thingy, Win.  And we going to see that again and again till next WM ma goodness what a mediocrity
You going to lose a lot of WWE fans if you keep giving this match to Roman reigns cuz we know it was fixed that you gave the wind to Roman reigns
😴. Same ol s***
Can I talk to WWE 😢
Rock vs Reigns at mania40 is on the line,end of an era
Listen to the crowd for Cody’s entrance
So sad how this match ended. it was a fantastic match for sure, but it left me disappointed, my kids are frustrated and tired of the same story each PPV. Roman Reigns is that box of cereal you have had in the pantry for over 2 years... STALE. The only draw for the bloodline was the Sami arch which has come to a close on night 2 just like Romans title reign should have too. Kids don't even want to watch this week and I cant blame them... sad days if my kids don't want to watch anymore then I have no reason to continue caring.
Lagi dan lagi si baby roman butuh bantuan merangkak dari saudaranya,kemenangan yg tak akan  pernah murni...👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Lets be honest he didn't get the victory because he's known as an AEW guy. It's the same when situation when WWE bought WCW and Triple H beat all there top guys because they weren't WWE guys. I know Cody's time will come but not at a PPV event as big as Wrestlemania.
This sucks big time. Wwe should hv relinquish the title to Cody..as usual no spine company..utterly ridiculous.
Saw this as 50/50 either way. Cody winning here makes sense but the thing is Cody winning anywhere makes sense.  Y’all realize that if every baby face won the main event at Mania it would be too predictable?  Looks like we can get a few championship and weapons/specialty matches out of this with Roman winning and kicking Cody out of the title picture by the end of the year.  I think ultimately they’ll do Cody like they did Shawn Michaels in WM11/12 (1995/1996). He’ll win rumble in 2024 and then win the title from Roman at WM40.
Lets start by saying this was an amazing Wrestlemania, its been a while. the matches were good. even tho we didnt get the result we expected but it was still good.
How are you gonna bring Cody back just too lose at wrestlmania? Like I think I speak for everyone I'm tired of seeing Roman with the titles.
Paul Heyman. Hahaha..too funny
If Cody won y’all would hate him by backlash 🤣🤣 Roman getting to 1000 days is way more special then Cody winning at mania, Cody will probably get it at summer slam
I know a Vince booked match when I see one. 😒
Stole Cody’s moment too sell some Roman tshirts just gross by triple h
It's the first time that I don't even care about the champion if he losses or not because it's too obvious and boring. There's no entertainment about THE title for the first time in WWE history and I'm not exaggerating. I would rather watch Peppa pig than watch Roman Reigns against any opponent.  We know what will happen and the worst thing is that we know HOW it'll happen every Roman match since he won those titles is exactly the same and all the hype comes from his opponent.   I'm not a fan of Cody but this guy have unique skills on the mic and on the ring he does everything correctly and that's how he gets treated? Just because you want to make a jey vs reigns storyline? From the one side we had mr perfect and from the other side a guy that got overweight since became a champion and barely fights (and when he does he barely does something impressive).  First humiliating your biggest legend (Cena) and now this just a day later? Congratulations 🤮
How is it that Reigns wins the match when Solo interfered , Reigns should have lost the match due to interference at least Sami and Kevin defeated The Usos!
The thing I hate about Roman is that he always cheats it was good before but it is kinda boring now because he has had the title for like 3 years and also what happened last night at wrestmania 39 almost made me quit watching it like make a change every once in a while
Honestly I was hoping Cody win this rush, he deserves a rematch with just Roman and Cody, I'm glad Kevin and Sami was there to help
roman is nothing without the USOS and Solo. Just nothing. What the hell was that?
I know Roman Reigns is good. But his championship reign is getting lame. Cody deserved this win
Cody needs a longer build up storyline to get the crown... it's too sudden after his injury to crown him. Needs a failure storyline to build him back up
Ｔｏｏ　ｄｉｒｔｙ！
Cody won but then they had to cheat and I was there pibe great show but Cody is the real Champion God bless Homs and his beautiful family and who ever sees this
Same as Booker T.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dream will have that belt soon.
WWE really hates us 😢
Gran canción
i think  wwe made this story for wwe future if cody won this match there will not be any kind of exciting next shows specially  after kevin owens and sami zayn winning this is wrestling its show and they are surely know and calculate every that before wrestlemania
Disappointing match, Cody definitely not main event quality yet imo
I give up honestly. 3 chances tk make a new superstar for the next few years. This was the ultimate and they completely ruined it. I only started watching wwe again last Mania to see where Codys journey ends up and now I'm done. Nothing changes no matter what management. The Bianca win also.
The one who wrote the script for the fight: COPY AND PASTE OF ALL ROMAN'S FIGHTS 🤑
I wanted to see Cody win with a schoolboy
“I must finish the story” 🤣🤣🤣 no way was he ever beating roman he’s the 🐐
wwe sucks
Great match, great story… then they mess it up for a 1000 day slogan, because they don’t care about anyone but Roman… and have it end in the same boring, over used childish way that isn’t surprising just aggravating. Well done WWE you officially have killed Cody’s run
Cody was never meant to win here not at this time. His storyline is coming to another chapter just watch in the few months of developing this story Cody will be champion in the next 12 months
Wow cody had that when will roman reigns lose the title put him up against Gunther or something
All so he can reach 1K days. Does reaching that matter that much to WWE. They won’t be able to capture the same magic again say they do this again at Summerslam. Cody will never be as hot as this
NGL Cody be looking like all might
Wow wrestling SUCKS now bad timing just kills it for me
After 30 years watching wrestling wwe I'll not watch again  jo roman reigns  always cheat to win always needs  bloodline helps him
As someone who was cheering for Roman during this match I'm surprised Cody lost. Really thought they would have let him win.
We the ones
Wwe gonna wwe
its good that cody didnt win, hes a midcarder
And of course Roman Reigns retains his titles 😂
☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽
There was never a better time and will never be a better time to change hands. You guys blew it. Vince must be back.
This was a waste of my time Cody deserves it more
Real hype, electric environment, and a great main event… then they go with the finish that killed all buzz around the weekend.  Idk man.  This felt like it was going to be an iconic Mania.  Feels like they missed the boat.
WoW
TREMENDA SUPER CAGADA -100/10 y ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
Roman as he does in every match got destroyed and as usual his clowns did the work for him. Acknowledge the tribal joke. Wwe needs to send him packing. Enough of him already it's getting reallllyyy boring
A 5 star story.  A 5 star match. A 5 star crowd.  A 5 star build.   1 Star ending.   THIS was the time to end the reign of reigns. THIS was the moment to pull the trigger. Roman being at the top uncontested  in my opinion has been threatening to drag on now for a little while, and realistically they wont end a 3 year historical reign at any other PPV than a Mania so more than likely we have another year of Roman on top. And even if they do end it, it just wont be the same seeing it happen at Summerslam or Survivor Series as it does at Mania.   I hope I'm wrong and I hope they have alot more in the chamber for this story, but damn I hate that they ended this the same way they ended every other Reigns match.
I'm mad
☝🏾
He was better off in aew atleast he could book himself to win well here comes jobber/mid card Cody again
We lost the Cody story     But we gained an 1000 day reign *and* a chance for Jey to make things come full circle. Are you ready?
To All the whiny Cody fans. How does the L feel you homelander wannabe champ dorks😂😂acknowledge him☝🏾
I tried to tell everyone roman is the best option to win and I would be done if he lost but I’m actually surprised wwe went with that better option lmao.  Rock and Bray are the only ones I wanna see beat tribal chief Roman and both those fueds would be insane given the mic skills entertainment n creativity of bray and rock   Cody down the road def deserves title reigns and a title match against Randy   Also need that demon Finn Baylor vs evolved fiend like bray Wyatt   Also need edge vs bray fued    Bobby n Brock 2 most legit baddazzes ever. Don’t wanna see either of them lose another match ever so I hope Brock just goes ahead and retires. Would love to see a Bobby vs Roman hurt business vs bloodline MVP vs Paul Heyman on the mic fued   Omos vs Roman and omos vs bray would be interesting as well one day
☝🏼
Wow >> reigns only won thanks to solo, kinda didnt like the ending but I know there aiming for reigns holding them for 1000 days then loosing them
The whole wwe universe wanted Cody to win 😢 what a let down ……. Wwe like always
With everything going I kinda predicted roman was gonna unfortunately cause of Vince and for his title reign to reach the ungodly 1000 days as champ my prediction for that is that he potentially could lose the title this year to whoever is money in the bank once he hits 1000 days as champ and I have a few names the could be interesting candidates to win the money in the bank match
WM 40 need a Genkidama with Hogan, Bret, Shawn, Austin, Rock and Cena to defeat RR😢
The Ratio is crazy 23k likes to 35k dislikes at the time of this comment
I just unsubscribed. Total waste of time to watch WWE. Do much drama around Roman
From the least talented Shield member to one of the most overrated wrestlers in history, that's the story of Roman Reigns. During Shield he was a henchman, merely got the mic, then out of nowhere he's handed belt after belt. WWE trying to build him like the next Cena, but he doesn't have half of Cena charisma.
WWE has ruined the "Finish".. Imagine kicking out of the DDT 5+plus times lmao..
Smart move by WWE. AEW had something going with Cody. He even disrespected HHH over there. Smart business move. He’ll be back to fighting bums in a couple months
Cody I’m so sorry triple H did you this way. You deserved to win. This was your moment
has anyone heard the old roman reigns theme song🤔🤔🤔 7:14
Someone has a championship belt, that they didn't earn or don't deserve.  Only has the championship belts because, as usual he can't do it on their own. LOSER,!!!!!
acknowledge him
How to silence a crowd with one booking decision, from HHH McMahon himself
Well scripted if not the match would have been one on one, kudos cody.
Cody merecia ser o campeão
Love this ending!!! 💪🏼💪🏼
Once a cheat always a cheat
Román sucks
Cody Rhodes el luchador más completo de todos los tiempos. La encarnación de Sting , Bred Hart , Goldberg ( técnica fuerza y velocidad ) .
Cody is not a main event type a guy Roman is the greatest of all time now book it Roman vs Rock next year
That’s was cody moment!!!!!! Bad decision!
I’m boycotting wwe for a year. What’s the point of watching if they keep having Roman win? BORING, BLAND, STALE, REDUNDANT.
Let just say the tribal chief is a legend💪💪💪💪
Roman Reigns Retains! ☝🏻
Worst decision in wwe for ages
Im sad about Cody but this is long term booking he'll get the title
Imagine if this loss turned cody into homelander 😬
This is a Rock Wrestlemania 16 moment. Cody will get the belt but it will be at the next ppv. I love Roman but just like the Rock should have beat Triple H at mania 16, Cody should have got it last night. I really thought he had it when he did the Dusty elbow!
"CODY GIVING HIS WEIGHT BELT TO BRODIES SON AND HOLDING HIS DAUGHTER THAT'S HIS WRESTLEMANIA MOMENT, THAT'S HIS DREAM, THAT'S HIS STORY, HE'S THE AMERICAN DREAM NO MATTER WHAT I'M PROUD OF YOU CODY RHODES".🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
can we get a clean roman reigns match for once
Cody you did your best but  Romeo  is number 1
Only his brother Seth freaking Rollins can end Roman’s reign
Was there. What a match and what an atmosphere.  The right person won to me that night. Incredible storyline and the reason why I'm back to watching WWE.
THE DAYUM TIMING FOR THE PYRO CODY GOT THE MOST FIREWORKS IDC AND THE WOAH WAS PERFECTTTTT 😮‍💨
Wwe is an old and sucks thing to watch the same story line since ever we have to give aew a chance and prove wwe that fans are what they have to hear
The only persone in the  wwe who could beat  roman reigns. WWE MAKE ROMAN REIGNS WIN 😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒
Me estoy imaginando los dislikes q tiene q tener este video xddd
he should have changed the script and should have remained champion Rhodes deserved it
Man wat a great match. An I really have respect for Cody. But c‘mon! This was Cody’s moment! Let him have it. Hell, at least split the freaking titles an have Cody win the raw title since she’s on freakin Raw!!! Roman still keeps the smackdown title.
Man. Some people think this was a good idea? Stockholm syndrome in full effect.
Nobody talks about the Son of Jon Huber Aka Mr. brodie lee
I guess big egos run in the younger generation of the anoai family
They should have had Cody win, turn Roman heel. Would have set up so many other matches
Maybe Reins will drop the belts to Dominik!! Lol wouldn’t that be something!! Woooo
Cry marks cry😂
What an awful ending
I blame wwe
Tremenda cagada
sad he lost tho
The god Roman 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wwe will always stay the same shoving Roman down out throats but this time they tricked us into liking it, making the same mistake as last time but they’re gonna justify it now bc Roman’s a heel
I'd say HHH has roman keep the title till 1000 days then Rhodes will win the title and Sami,Ko and Rhodes will make faction with the titles and that would be the best way for him to win it
REIGNS CHEATER LOSER😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Aew
Aew
Aew
Aew
Para mi ese luchador no se meresia apareser y q de una vez le dieran la oportunidad tan grande asi se la meresian otros q si estavan activos brock lesnar el monstruo entre honbres o otro
Aew
Aew
the best match in wrestlemania 39  ever
Cody was robbed of his time to shine. I'm so over the Roman reigns bloodline storyline. Move on already
A story of this magnitude to me can only be resolves at wrestlemania. We needed the 81,000 people screaming at the top of their lungs in one of the best stadiums on the planet. The next best thing is summer slam but in my opinion if Cody does get his win in the near future it just wont hit the same. If we nave to wait till WM 40 idk if i can handle roman as champ for that much longer
Only Dolph Ziggler can dethrone Roman Reigns
YEA IK IT THEY WASN'T LETTING CODY BEAT THE TRIBAL CHIEF 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Roman Reigns the Goat
This is why I skipped wrestlmania
It was not going to be suprise if cody won. Everybody  was  counting on it but , we know what happen the suprise was 👍
Cody 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
Hell no he need to go back to aew 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
Them man cheat
☝️☝️☝️🔥
HHH heart was the biggest sell of the year for keeping him alive this is seriously your ending this is why wrestling fans groaned when he got wwe its sports but not entertainment
Cody not deserves champion👎😆
so he cheated what a shocker
W roman he deserves it better than undertaker streak epically with both title
I’m actually so tired of Roman being champion
Roman suxs as champion
My kids were angry they stayed up to watch that garbage ending. Thanks for making my family miserable at midnight with your lazy repetitive booking. We are all so sick of this. Roman sucks. He can't win clean. We get it. Why should we care anymore?
Wwe hasn't Roman  won too much
Roman always wins
Tired of seeing Roman as champion f-ing pissed off Cody didn't win
I'm curious if anyone can ID the shoes KO is wearing, id like a pair
Who is pissed
Just please let Roman lose
I Love AEW
Boooooring..
WWE has no balls. Shame on you WWE🤦🏻‍♂️
Nunca gana limpio, siempre con ayuda de la perritas de sus primas 😊
Just why can't Cody win
Cody got helped and still lost… ? Im lost for words …have we overestimated cody rhodes?
Its 4 vs 3 soo roman cheat lol
Why win the royal rumble just to lose at mania, smh
There just using Cody Rhodes over he should of stayed in AEW because WWE sucks.
Just like Solo, Cody isn't ready.
Mil dias para nuestro jefe
Eso no sirve
So basically this is going to build to Roman vs Jey or Roman vs Solo right? I mean if they didn’t pull the trigger on Cody then who’s going to beat Roman? Maybe Gunther if it’s not someone else in the Bloodline? Idk
ENOUGH OF ROMAN REIGNS
Pffff Again Roman Cheat
This is all vince fault
The WWE worked cody over just like they did to his father and his brother Dustin. McMann has always had it out for the Rhodes family.  This match was just as bad as the Montreal screw job.
1 v 5
Roman Reigns top top ❤
Again, this is why the Royal Rumble and WrestleMania have lost their magic years ago. The WWE tries to be so cool with swerves and ends up outsmarting themselves. Wrestling stories are SUPPOSED to be about babyfaces, NOT HEELS. Yet they allow the EXACT same heel to defeat 4 babyfaces 3 years in a row. 3 Royal Rumble winners all lose to the exact same heel, and they wonder why their product hasn’t reached the levels it was once at. SMH.
I wouldn’t even a waste your money to attend or watch wrestlemania on PPV! It’s turned into garbage
Win or lose we are proud of you Cody did a great performance against Roman She deserves to win and I deserve it but Roman is a cheat
Siko solo lifetime aso aww aww
Boring...
When cody rose up from his entrance he looked like a doll
Im speechless it should be cody...
Bro what I got from this is basically the “Universal Champion” Roman Reigns who’s held the belt for 900+ days couldn’t beat Cody Rhodes on a fair One on One  he needed his 3 cousins to help him🤦🏽‍♂️ crazy I use to hate Cody cause I’m Rey Fan but wow how I’ve been rooting for him and singing his song , seen him on Friday and he started off with California Love lyrics 😂💀🔥🔥🔥 WWE knows what there doing now everyone is going to watch the next PPV to see what happens next💯
is it must wwe to get scripted?
Prime example of WWE overthinking things for shock value when everybody just wanted the obvious conclusion. Awful, just awful booking.
Scheiße das er schon wieder gewonnen hat es nervt langsam da hätte sich die WWE was besseres machen können👎👎👎
I’m not this bullshyt anymore I’m going to aew WWE is some shyt forreal
It’s crazy cuz I’m seein half these people say L for the decision and they can’t mess wit wwe anymore but literally not even 3 mins before they entered .. they and everyone was sayin how good wwe is back to being and that this will be a great ending no matter who wins.. be consistent and keep the same energy folks is all I’m sayin 🤝.
Nah just Vince McMahon’s agenda always loving big men since the “Golden Era”. Everyone knows how bias Vince is and loves his big guys with big muscles and much more
Cody didn't win! It sucks 😕  period. How in the world you let the man win the royal rumble but didn't let him win the big one 🤔  at Wrestlemania. You wrong for that wwe 👎👎👎👎
☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝
☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️
Bruh they did Cody dirty… İt was his time he was the chosen one to beat Roman! I don’t know why Roman is still the champ I’m so bored of it.
I will be hated for this, but actually it's good that Cody did not win! It would have been to predictable. To be honest Cody do not have the hype to defeat Roman. I'm also bored with Roman era and his longevity as champion, but Cody was not the man to defeat him at Wrestlemania.. Maybe at Payback he will have his moment.
As usual he has to cheat to win.
Cody championship journey is similar to mick foleys… and when Cody does win , it’ll feel like when Eddie Guerrero won
I’m so mad
They always cheat.
Wwufc
So Roman's never gonna win clean? Like...ever?
He will get the title one day for sure, but for now, the face of the company is Roman. No one even close to him. They intend to make him pass 1000 days as a champion I guess.
He will get the title one day for sure, but for now, the face of the company is Roman. No one even close to him. They intend to make him pass 1000 days as a champion I guess.
Cody deserved to be a champion, why dont they give champion any person from Roman, I got bored and I think audiences started to get bored from this situation. Maybe Dean return and take champion, i think this will be best selection
So pissed at the ending. The tribal Queef needs to go. 😡😡😡
disliked lmao
pls get rid of roman reigns! hes not star material! dont force it WWE.
Why Cody , Why ?
So at this point why not have Roman beat Bruno’s record…  They already buried the best guy to beat Roman so let’s just keep doing the same match over and over see you guys in May 2028 when he does it
Acknowledge him ‼️☝🏾
MnR is going to wild
I'm a huge Roman fan (even if I shouldn't be,) but I am completely shocked that WWE didn't give that to Cody.
The finish of the match is so miserable that they don’t even show it in the highlights. Significant.
This is why I hate wwe Let another person to be champion because it’s getting boring with Roman 😡😡
You could see it written on his face, man
Thank God for Roman, we would've been deaf to death of the same finish the story saga
Just here to hit the dislike 👎 button   Absolutely shocking result   Boring outcome   Has made me feel like not even tuning into raw or anything else now
It's like every other Roman title defense always a interference involved I don't know how that's being a dominant champion. His whole title rain is tainted . It don't matter if it's 5,000 days if you always cheat to retain your not real champion.. theirs nobody in WWE I hate & dispise more than that man Roman Reigns.i was at work once I found out through my friend he cheated. I didn't bother watching the match it wasn't worth my time
Roman is a king 👑
Roman Reigns has put hard times on this country.
From undesirable to un god damn deniable.
Haven’t watched a Wrestlemania since number 12. Attitude era. Gave this one a chance to see Cody win. WWE fail. Back to not being a fan again. I gave you a chance to have me back. Y’all messed this one up.
Just stop watch WWE because this is not fair anymore Roman how long you want to be paper champion?
Aquí debió de terminar la racha 😿
This would've been a perfect randy orton return, he could've showed up as a vigilante against solo
To everyone saying it's not Cody's time or let the story play out. Then when will it be his time to earn it? By Summerslam, I don't believe people will be interested in Cody winning it by then.
This match was very good and Cody Rhodes had to win I am very sorry for his defeat
👆
WWE is still not ready to confide in Cody to be the face of the company...
Cody should be Champion
Great match
Well, that was underwhelming. I can't say a lot of things. But I prefer to start saying how bad played it was, the lack of logic and the consequences in a business aspect
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Cody should get rematch ban Heyman  usos and solo from ringside
Roman el mejor saludos desde 🇪🇨
Yesssss roman
At this point, Roman Reigns could surpass every WWE superstar that's ever hit the longest Champion.  It would've been awesome if Cody won tho, The Bloodline's faces would be funny to see if The Usos & Roman Reigns failed to win. BTW, PPVs are a bit better watching them live than watching them after, but they're a lot better if you're there in person.
Honestly I think it was booked right, leads to more compelling storyline down the line and Roman can get the 1000 day reign. I'm guessing now with Triple H as the lead, they prefer long term storytelling so hopefully we get an even better storyline.
As a Samoan 🇦🇸, I was shocked because I and 60% of the WWE universe was going for Cody 😔, Til then...☝️
American Knightmare should have a little more noir ( an anti hero persona), ala Sting, Under Taker and Steve Austin. He needs a more potent finisher  (Code Name) and a submission manuever (Cross Rhodes) Bring back the Eagle Wing Belt and the Big Goldie
The only reason roman retained bc they want him to hold the titles for 1000 days and Cody might get rematch at summerslam and would beat roman bc roman would have already passed 1000 days by the time summer slam comes
Roman all the wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Raising those champion are worthy as those fireworks 🎉
Paul hey man needs to go too
Only The Fiend is strong enough to beat the Tribal Chief.
ONLY Bray Wyatt should beat Roman Reigns for the Universal Championship that he was never pinned for.
He cheated !! Roman needs to go !!! Someone stop him he’s been champion for too long
Such a terrible anti climatic ending.
And the winner the paper champion who cannot do anything by himself Boreman Lames
Bobby Lashley will beat Roman.
Like I said Roman Roman reigns he has to have his cousins come out and do the dirty work for him that's only way he can keep that belt that's why, part-time champions like he's to call Brock Lesnar part-time champion he's a punk
INTERFERENCES, by the shameless bloodline? When is it going to stop?
Knowing Solo Sikoa was  BANNED 🚫 from Ring Side, if he never came back CODY RHODES would of WON the championship 💯💯💯
It's difficult & Impossible to defeat Roman Empire
He had to at least get1000 days as UV champ can't hate roman.
con la derrota de cody perdió el wrestling :,(
Relax guys Roman’s got 2 more months to kiss those titles
WWE fumbled the ball here.  I get the story still continues and one chapter has closed.  But, it’s very possible to tell a bad story.  This is an example of a bad story.  Sorry Cody 😢
1:20 This is the nicest thing that happened in WrestleMania the most beautiful family
Acknowledge him!
Roman Reigns winning seems more believable. Once Cody’s health is back at  100% he would make a great champ.
Cody deserves to win his performance was great and he almost defeated Roman had it not been for the intervention of Solo and the Usos and as usual Roman resorted to cheating
Is it me or did Cody carry the match, Cody looked so much better then Roman did in this match,
Sikoa was dishonorable that was a match between two fighters and sikoa cheated to gain Romans win bloodline stooges
Wwe dropping the ball yet again by letting Roman cheat to win
Cody’s entrance 🥹
Old Roman is best
The right man won. Cody just isn't The One.
Dogshit as usual, McIntyre still deserves his time
Cheating
That title roman carries has no honor or prestige it's being held by a paper champion who needs his family to help him keep that championship they call him a legend not in my book a legend is Dusty Rhodes, Bruno Sanmartino, Roman taints his legacy by allowing his family to help him retain Bad show WWE if I was there I would want my money back
Cody Rhodes should have won The Undisputed WWE universal championship
People were expecting Cody to win on his first attempt against a character who hasn't been pinned since 2019. Sometimes, being realistic isn't bad. Roman lost so many title matches to Lesnar before taking a title off of him. Cody comes in last year December, gets injured halfway through on his journey, gets in the rumble at #30 wins it and all of a sudden y'all expect him to win against a champion who has dominated just on his first attempt? Come on😂
☝
wwe zotmang f1c1k hunter
No just no boo!
What a disappointment of an ending Roman Reigns is getting stale his heel character is wack now. Vince Mcmahon is pushing this garbage
People are saying it’s a way to build up to next WM. That’s the issue. Raw has no world championship. There is nothing on Raw to fight for, so many great stars are floating around doing nothing. Roman Reigns indirectly hurts other stars, even ones not involved with anything related to him. If Roman Reigns only held the Universal Championship it would be a bit more fine, but since he has BOTH titles, and he is a part timer, we are essentially watching a wrestling show without a world championship. The issue is, is we have to suffer another entire year of this. There is no stage big enough other than WM to take the titles off him. Any time he wins at WM means another year of no world championships. It’s so frustrating as a fan. I want a world championship that is defended in clean matches every PPV.
😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤
almost disappointed 😢
not even a fan of Roman but damn, he is IRREPLACEABLE
1000 Days that's what they want. Then Roman goes to acting like his cousin Dwayne.
Most stupid & biased streaming ever👎. You cut off all the moments of Reigns.
The decision of finishing this match this way is un-freaking-believable...
The interference and ending to this match sure did feel like a typical Vince McMahon move to me.  Silly me thinking we would actually get to see a one-on-one match without interference for once when it comes to title matches with Roman.  Overall, still a great match before the interference.
Todos estamos con Cody ahora😢
Cody got cheated by the bloodline which proves Roman can’t win a match cleanly so he sucks. The only way Roman knows how to win is to cheat .Roman is a scumbag and cheater
Cant believe he give Roman again the Titel and Stil Champion oh man what a sh... hope so Title Split on Raw or Smackdown.
Hot take: Nobody should ever hold a championship for longer than a year. Roman is a top athlete but give others the spotlight man.
Roman, you are not the Osu wrestler
Injusticiaaaaa...!!!!! Cody merecías ganar. Ese traje de cody estaba ala altura de hacerlo lucir campeon y tanto muestran ala familia de cody para q no sea ccampeon
I don't normally post anything negative online, but this was such a disappointing letdown. Roman wins AGAIN because his goons ALWAYS interfere and help him CHEAT. So annoying. 1,000 days as a champion who can never win on their own and always needs help. Can't believe people still buy into this nonsense.
Mania 40 rematch 😪
And still champion baby. Roman reigns ☝️
I wanted Cody to won however I believe it was the right call to have Roman still hold on to the titles.
You can never defeat Roman 🎉❤
I love them doing this I’ve been saying that the only person who should take the titles is Jey USO then Sami can feud with him and then we can get Cody getting the titles but Cody got handed so much as soon as he got back he didn’t earn anything so the payoff wouldn’t be as great as it will be when he earns it.
the fight was supposed to be as follows, if someone from the bloodline entered to disrupt the fight, Roman Reigns would lose both titles automatically
Summerslam then cuz smh
Let's hope for the summerslam! Roman's 1000 days reign will be completed till then. So they can have a match there and I believe Cody will do it !☺️
I guess they wanted roman to reach 1000 days of reign. But last 3 WM has very bad endings. Kudos to both, they deliver their best, but not the ending everyone is hoping for.
Yes yes yes hallelujah good 👍 👆👆👆👆👆♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
WRESTLEMANIA…ACKNOWLEDGE ME! 👑
All the people who sang triple Hs praises for booking 😂😂 forget about the Daniel Bryan being a B+ player comments ... WWE just said they don't an F what the fans want... more Roman reigns being shoved down our throats
Roman must be good in the back room.
❤️‍🔥☝️
That was horrible, its was like a 2 on 1, everyone was expecting Rhodes to win. Worst decision ever :(
Cody "The Best One Man Army", nobody better than him!
Una absoluta mierda lo que hicieron, Roman Reigns es lo peor que le pudo haber pasadona la WWE
Cody had Roman completely beat but  the interference was BS, I guess they're trying to preserve Cody Rhodes story from being finished too soon, but its Coming soon, WrestleMania Backlash or hopefully Tonight He Will Finish the Story
Cody wins at backlash or summerslam?
This is why I don't trust wwe anymore. So much build this was the perfect moment to build an John Cena style babyface and just squander it away forcing Roman down out throats. Cody won't be able to build the momentum he had leading into this event.... what a waste
yawwn, 'stong' roman wins again and defends his titles for a millionth time.. BLAME  vince and his samoan fetish for killing wwe and roman being fored down our throats for almost a decade now,  vince was clearly in charge of day 2 of wm creative and the cr ap booking! wish he just retired and left the company leaving trips run things because HHH has made the product watchable again only for it to be undone by vince who still thinks its 1995..
Acknowledge Him☝🏾
It was Cody's moment, im going to take some time away after this
Cody will eventually win the title. Awesome match!
Culpable sólo sikoa
Roman again and again...triple h so stupid
ha.....
Goddamn you WWE why the hell would you do that bro this is going to piss off a lot of people we already lost so many people why would you do that when he came back they really did Cody wrong and that wasn't you deserve to win Roman doesn't defend his titles as much and I think that's stupid that's pissing me off we need somebody losing to be there on a daily basis to defend the titles everyday
There is a Entertainment wrestling champion that has been a champion for over 6 1/2 years. He was not a WWE  champion. His name was Lou Thesz. He was a NWA Champion from 1949-1956. He was champion for 2300 days.
Serves cody right. Mcintyre should have been the one to finish roman
Cody should of won
This is the type of booking that Vince McMahon did out of spite that upset the fans so now that he's back in a "supervisory role" it just reeks of his influence. The wwe conditions fans to accept nonsense like this and unfortunately this was a missed opportunity for Cody Rhodes. For it to happen at a lesser ppv won't be as special as Wrestlemania.
Toc toc, Who Is ? Cody.. Cody Who? Exatly
Bet this had to do with Endeavor buying WWE, they probably didn't want a new unproven face of the company start off with. Cody was probably booked to win before the sale agreement.
Cody sucks haha. I dont even like Roman but Cody doesn't deserve to win.
i was disspointed when i saw roman win cause i wanted cody too win but looking at it now it makes more sense for roman too retain , cody having a title run would've been insane tho!
That’s bull
Roman won all is right in the wrestling world!!!!!!
YESSS I BET MONEY ON ROMAN THAT HE WILL WIN
Stay up cody..if the 2 shirleys n zero did not help pebble(he aint no rock)...you are the champ
always roman won by the usos
Cody’s face sold that he wasn’t going over
Roman Is greatest
when roman reaches 1000 days then the wwe will take the titles off him i believe but not until then
never gonna bother watch wwe again
☝🏼🩸🐐
Haven’t felt a buzz for a main event like this since Wrestlemania 17.
I Place Bets On The Fact That The Referee Will Be Taken Out In Roman's Matchs And I Always WIN.All Of Roman's Matches Are "PREDICTABLE"!WWE Should Change The Name From WrestleMania To PREDICTAMANIA😂
Creo que muchos esperamos por meses este wrestemania para que nos den este resultado
Roman have no balls to fight opponents genuinely .. he everytine needs help ... And those interefere in this match should be ban drom WWe for one year ...
I was surprised thought they was going to finally let Roman lose. Now what’s next don’t see him dropping the title until maybe SummerSlam.
romaann  only bcz iam here.
This some bullsh*t😒🤨. The hype train 'roman' is long past the station.(no idc if this message or acc gets deleted😂
Pretty sure this is setting up jey vs roman
At least the wwe doesn't spoil their own matches like some other wrestling company
Welcome to the triple h reign of terror 2.0
And this is why I no longer watch wrestling.
I wish it was 1980,s and the best of wrestling was still to come 😢
They buried sting. Yall really think they weren't gonna bury Cody?
I’m sorry but it’s night right every night 1 loss but I’m night 2 everyone retain the bloodline should’ve broken up there
Ese dama gana con trampa
For the first time i got happy for Roman
Seeing that Endeavor now owns WWE, it's possible they only kept him champ for that very sale  Risky having a new face of the company during such a huge sale
البطل الغشاش
I think that in order for Roman reigns to lose the titles first he must lose the support of the bloodline and be betrayed by them and I guess this will start when he'll definitely punish the Usos for losing the tag titles ...the bloodline story is far from over that's why Cody lost
☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽
Che schifo..ancora roman...
Meh
sigh I was preparing to cry when Cody won but sigh. Not even my ex gave me this kind of heartbreak
Wow you can hear them trying to censor the boos in the back ground with there audio software but it's still coming through so everything sounda quite 😂
OMG WHAT A CRAZY FIGHT
With Roman winning, I will finally quit wwe for good, worst wrestlemania ending of all time.
1:21 alone made him deserve the win
The bloodline cheated
Tbh I understand that decision from the booking perspective. Roman defending the titles brings many opportunities like a possible emotional retirement angle with Cody, either Roman or Usos turning on the Bloodline and the biggest story of them all is also on the table. Remember in a year it's Wrestlemania 40. Who won at Wrestlemania 20? Who won at Wrestlemania 30? The biggest babyfaces and workhorses. You have an amazing opportunity to do Sami vs Roman at Wrestlemania 40. If Cody won, where do you go from there? I know it's a nice ending to an amazing story (and I wanted him to win too), but there are just more benefits to Roman winning (from bussiness and story points of view).
My tribal chief ❤
ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRIBAL KING☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾
Big mistake from Triple H...
ROMAN WRESTLERMANIA DID ACKNOWLEDGE YOU 👍UP BROTHER YOU'RE TRULY A BLOODLINE ❤🙏
I am the happiest man on earth ☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝
The crazy thing is I am cool with Roman winning over Cody Rhodes because of him potentially being champion for 1,000 days. Now you have three options: Gunther, Cody, or Seth Rollins to potentially break that streak.
Another disappointing match that included Roman Reigns again.  I'm not even surprised anymore.  I'm just kicking myself that I actually wanted to see it.  The worst part is, Roman is doing the best work in his ENTIRE career (I can be honest with that).  Which is sad, because I still find him to be a joke.  This was a chance to make a huge star with a great in-ring storyteller.  At the very least, have Roman actually EARN the win on his own.  This was one of the biggest fails in Wreslemania history, in my opinion.  I'm sure I'm not in the minority in this way of thinking either.  This stuff is why I stopped watching when Bray Wyatt left.  After this, I think even if Bray comes back, I may not.
Roman can't win without backup
Comparing to Awe, this champion match is quite boring. As I predicted there is no way Cody can beat Roman because of the script
Comparing to Awe, this champion match is quite boring. As I predicted there is no way Cody can beat Roman because of the script
Lets Goooooo Roman 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bro when is he gonna To lose Those title
I told you Roman Reigns gonna told you up Cody Rhodes nothing you can do about it.
How long is Roman going to have the title? Hasn't he had it for like 3 years now. BORING! another reason I switched to AEW. You have to change the title out once in a while to make it interesting
I mean, even if Cody beats Roman for the belts at some point in the future, it will never be as climactic and as big of a deal as it would have been at mania
So happy Roman won! All the 40 year old wrestling fans living in their parents basement can go kick rocks
Jeez. Still with The Bloodline? It’s gotta end at some point or it’ll end up like NWO
Nothing new for Cody lost twice to a PPV first was losing to Jericho
YESSSSSSSSSS
They do not know how to make it great they keep making him win wwe sucks
Good call. It had felt like Cody was gonna win every since he won the royal rumble. It would have been too predictable for him to win. His time is coming , it just wasn’t the right time to put him over just yet
I knew my boy was going to win! Ain't nobody beating Roman on this network bruh! All hail the tribal chief! 💪🏾💯💯
As Vince says, it was good for business.
Adrenaline In my soul Roman buries Cody Rhodes
Wwe always has to have their guy that it ruines every moment that supposed to be great and last a life time. Oh well I just won't watch as much cuz what's the point. Y'all already told us Austin theory is gonna be the next roman so what's the point of watching.
thằng roman+ 4 con chó = Cody😂
Roman would of lost without the bloodline
And still WWE undisputed universal champion....THE ENTIRE BLOODLINE because we all know and saw that Roman Reigns CANNOT do it himself WHAT A PUNK
Some  people  may  stop watching  until  they hear Roman  looses the belts
You know what a few years ago I would have been mad and angry. As heart broken as it is its good. Perfect. IF this is long term story telling. And that's a big IF
Worse highlights ever..
It doesn't sound right, that Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens are the tag team champions. Feels wrong
Wooow 🤣🤣
The champ
Who won ?
Acknowledge Your Tribal Chief WWE built it Up Perfect To Let All you who arent the Ones Down... We Will Get Our Tag Belts Back Honestly they need to be Split back up
Jey uso has to be the☝🏽 it’s his story!
Robo
This match was lackluster so much hype built up for it and it didn't deliver in a new champion whoever Roman Reigns is challenged by next all I can say is good luck you'll need it
I guess vince booked the main event....
They should disqualify Roman Reigns because solo sikoa ruined Cody Rhodes win because he was going to win and everyone knew it. Cody Rhodes should be the undisputed wwe universal heavyweight champion. Solo wasn’t supposed to come back so Cody Rhodes should be champion right now not Roman Reigns
I give all respect for Roman it was a good match but he’s always has to have help at the end when he’s about to lose
Why did this happen? Why? Cody was my only hope. It was his victory. For how much longer will he win because of making a team?
i say give cody the wwe title and let roman keep the universal championship
Someone take Vince the hell out of his own company.  I get Roman is Vinces guy but damn it's time for a new champion.  Give Cody a rematch a backlash and put the belts on Cody.  My God 945 days is too long.  Roman needs a break and WWE needs a new champ.  Great story telling with the bloodline but now it's stale.
Can someone beat him already!
From a jobber to main-eventer, Cody
The good ol hayman distraction. Never fails. That ending angered me. 😤
Well atleast he doesn't have to deal with Tony khans terrible booking anymore😂
They succeeded in making you believe that Cody would win and he should have btw .This would have been a truly special wrestlemania moment .So invested in the story that it hurts seeing the AMERICAN NIGHTMARE lose .He will probably win later but that night would have been really special for him and for all the Wwe universe, with a victory.But then again what a great match !!Best Wrestlemania in years!!
This made for a great comeback story for Cody. This rivalry is going to be 🔥.
they turn cody into lex luger all the hype for nothing
Well now that I know who won from comments, sigh no need to watch it now. Guess Ill go back to my paranormal vids.
Roman hide in shadows Cody was the man ❤🎉
Roman's theme is off idk why they don't have the boom sound effect
مبروك عليه❤🎉
Roman 👏❤🎉
Man...I'm bored of this garbage
Set Rollins vs Román reing 😎
calling it now he wins next Wrestlemania
The main event was amazing granted I did end up falling asleep and when I woke up to hear Roman's music I was pissed. Its the next morning at I'm still annoyed. Its time for WWE to change their champion, I have a terrible feeling that Roman is about to have those titles for another year and I'm not liking where this is going. The look on Cody's face when Roman was walking away broke my heart, they basically brought Cody home (to WWE) just for him to lose the biggest match in his career. He deserves this more then anyone and the way he lost was so anticlimactic. Cody wasn't trying to win just for himself, it was for Dusty and his brother Dustin (Gold Dust for those who aren't familiar) for him to not win the title after working so hard is just beyond me. I have nothing against Roman, he is an amazing wrestler and he has been a great champion (when the Usos and Solo aren't stepping in) its just time for the title to change. Almost the entire crowd was behind Cody, his wife and child were there, they really built it up as if tonight was his night and that he would go home with those titles. The only thing I have left to say is why, they did this for what exactly? Michael Cole said it himself, Roman took down Daniel Bryan, Brock Lesner, John Cena, Logan Paul, Cesaro, Drew McEntire, Goldburge (Forgive me for any spelling mistakes), Sami, Kevin Owen, Big E (I'm pretty sure) and even Jey Uso himself I'm probably missing so many others but the point is some how none of them could knock him down. Its disappointing to see that they built Cody up just for him to lose. I really hope that they are going somewhere with this because it just feels odd to me that this was the way things turned out. With all that being said, WrestleMania was incredible, both nights were fantastic and everyone did an amazing job.
Boo roman he's a joke and I can take him and his family
C'était le moment de Cody mon Dieu .... pourquoi cette triche nous sommes fatigués pfff je reconnais un tricheur a mania 😭😣
This is the most amazing night for the both of them
Always putting the same champion every year, you are not creative, but you are very boring
Without support roman can never win a single title... ending made me cry 😭
WORST FINISH EVER
Pov wretlermania 100 1 , 2 , 3 Romana Regins I still the title
Casual kid fans like Roman. While real wrestling like Cody rhodes
900+ days isn't enough WWE? Seriously? This is getting old...and frankly, boring as hell.
Esos usos asen demasiada trampa ya me estoy cansando de la wwe solo por eso
☝🏽☝🏽 The Tribal Chief still no. 1☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽
When he wins.   Pray this didnt kill his momentum
Cody doesn’t deserve to win the title. He has done nothing to prove that he deserved it.
Cm punk said it best no matter how hard u try in this business there’s always gonna be the corporate pick who buries everyone.
Great match typical ending the  bloodline suck  they cannot ever win a match on skills alone because they always have to cheat
back to AEW buddy
I’m watching this cuz Cody’s my fifth favourite wrestler and Finns my favourite and he lost
☝🏽🔥
Cody will win, it just want the right time
I’m really annoyed with wwe at the moment Cody Rhodes performance was one of the best I’ve possibly seen in a long while their was hardly any fighting back from Roman reigns by then they make Roman win the title back again it’s just getting boring and repetitive
People should van wwe against this injustice
Sobrevalorado Román reigns hasta el 2050 será campeón yo me voy a AEW WRESTLiNG
Setting up another Fingerpoke of Doom moment for the title at Raw tonight!
And he becomes a part time part time champion that does nothing but vacas. triple H is that what you want a champion to be?
Vinnie getting back the creatives. Jesus christ man let it go old creep
Never been so disappointed, and I’ve been watching for 20years. Romans not the guy because we asked for it, Roman’s the guy for the last almost 10 years because he’s been forced down our throats. Talk about sucking energy, life, and desire to watch right out of ya. I will not be continuing to watch this show.
Huge fan. I remember the bad times when Roman was always PUSHED to win. It’s a shame he won this.
Do you guys still watch this NONSENSE LOOOOOL  look how fake it looks, the product has got worse, now they’re trying post match press conferences Looooooooool
I'm glad Roman Won
Ya better put some respect on his name, acknowledge the chief🙌🏾
The moment Roman won, I stood up from the couch and went to my room. I wasn't going to see the ending because I would end up crying 😢
I'm glad Roman Reigns didn't lose those titles. Good boy.
Roman Reigns u are suspend it  of Because Cody his moment he wants i want 6 Man tag team right here right now tonight Roman Reigns had a Easy Fight about I Give Hard way I want Bloodline leaves I don’t want see you anymore goodbye I want Paul heyman go to Advocate to be his Brcok Lesnar
That was bs cody got screwed he should have been the one
Incredible match
This is because Cody won at raw
GREATEST WRESTLEMANIA EVER!!!!
Again wwe bad for business
Where is the whole match  😊
This mania was 🗑
Cody and Romans match proves that wwe is fake
Wwe sobrevaloran mucho a Román reigns si vendieron y llenaron todo wrestlemania fue gracias a cody rhodes si hubieran puesto otro luchador no llenaban wrestlemania la segunda noche
Remember triple H's reign of terror? It's happening again, this time with the rocks cousin. 😒 Glad I tuned out right after triple H buried Booker T.
Roman may have won but he can’t win by him self
This had "Vince" booking all over it.
I think people were surprised by the Jey& Jimi loss besides Cody needed to humble the moment who knows
👎👎👎👎👎👎
I am sad that Cody didn’t get the titles HOWEVER thinking on it, you really think WWE was going to TOTALLY take out the bloodline? Lol. For Cody to ‘beat’ Roman, it’s going to probably take Cody, Sami, AND Kevin. Maybe in a 6 way tag team match. Something HUGE is going to happen for Cody to get the titles.
I hate umaga and son
Rat Chief 😂
Yeah Shitstain Reigns still Champion. What a great Night.
Finally cody rhodes acknowledges the tribal chief
Too bad Cody didn't win 😂 that was the best ended 😂
A load of B.S
Now ish ain't right. Cody was supposed to win the match. Hope WWE has a better story to go with. I'd prefer the Uso retaining than Roman
Cody's overconfident kills his chances. Let your actions speak not your egoist talk🤷🏻‍♂️
F
They have me wanting his cancer to come back.  Seems to be the only way we will ever get something new and creative
bad ending
ROMAN THE GOAT NO CURRENT WRESTLER IS READY TO TAKE HIS PLACE!!
If chody won no1 Wil watch wwe again,,, Roman makes da titles a win is a win
Bloodline forever!!! ☝️🩸
So WWE is going back to the shoved down our throats Roman we dealt with and the fans turned on those long 8 yrs greatttt.....👏😒
WWE - boring ending again.
How you not gonna show the end how he beats him
Nada que ver
Disappointed
Bro seeing them fighting in person was crazy best first time watching wwe next to the ring!!! But unfortunately cody lost 😥
honestly out of everyone in wwe i think stone cold cody could beat roman
Getting dangerously close to turning Cody into 93/94 Lex vs Yokozuna. Cody vs Roman II  at Summerslam should be the plan with Cody winning.
La pesadilla americana fue para Cody Rhodes
That sucked. Great night ruined by an awful ending. I’m done watching WWE for awhile.
People saying the ending sucked have no idea of anything, this is probably a one in a lifetime chance of someone reaching 1000 days as champion in recent memory.
All aew superstar hope Cody defeat that roman....
Roman can't even win a match without his cousin getting involve with the match cody had
Roman is boaring he has no personality
Great match! Bad ending...
L wwe l ending see how to crowd was so silent
Roman would had lost his matches so many times if not for his goons....... Next event, his goons will come to his rescue again and again. Cmon ...........
Everybody retained their titles on night 2, definitely a Vince idea
Siempre con ayuda gana aburrido ya es
Always needing help to win they need to ban those 2 from ringside and the right person would win this sucks
Can't believe roman won wow
Yeah guys vince back
The only reason Roman is champion is because of family
What a massive waste of time
Roman no-selling two straight Cross Rhodes? Do better WWE.
When Cody wins it’s gonna be legendary but the right man won 🤷🏿‍♂️
People complaining about the fact that roman won again by cheating like he did for the past 2/3 yrs, I mean wth you expecting from the top heel of this company. Clearly these people know nothing about WWE or how this business works in terms of face and heal. Also, it was pretty much obvious they were gonna let roman break the 1000 days mark.  Before you say anything: Yes im a roman fan, have been since he was in the shield. But im speaking facts here and you know it. As his biggest fan, I hope he doesnt just break the 1000 days mark but becomes the longest reigning champion of all time beating bruno sanmartinos 2800 days plus title reign. Then when he loses, he will probably retire. I know thats most likely not happening but still, it would be phenomenal if it does, well atleast for roman fans.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Triple H can’t cook . CM Punk was right bro a doofus
at the end did anyone else notice the rubber chicken in the ring
5:23  Are you hoping for  Cody or Roman😂
I need some time away from wrestling to process this loss man
I am a Bloodline Fan, but I hope the titles soon get split, Seth Rollins deserves a title.
If roman lost the belts, that would have been the end of the Roman empire
Cody winning that would have been nice n would have had meaning , but let's talk about that FUCKN pedigree OMG😮
You guys, dropped the ball, and that's saying something for wwe standards
Cody better you back with your brother. This company West really West
Knew Reigns was going to win they want him to hit the 1000  days mark as champion it won't be to shortly after that then he will finally lose the titles
I don’t think cody should win at the current moment with the time he has spent at wwe so far. If he didn’t get injured, than at least he will have more time to build himself. If he wins it at Wrestlemania, there definitely will be a backlash and he’ll just get booed. Cody knows this and he needs to build himself to be like how Daniel Bryan receives support from the fans. I bet Cody himself insists that he must not win at Wrestlemania.
They really ruined it with Roman winning
Great match so happy Roman didn’t lose. And I’m expecting the Usos to soon win their tag team championships again and when I say soon I mean like next SmackDown
This is getting boring ~
This is very boring we are tired of this
Rhodes was robbed! Reign needed help to win. Rhodes deserves a rematch. Period!
Cody gonna be back
Of course roman won wow WWE way to just keep it boring roman is getting old and boring real quick
Great another year of Roman burying everyone.  Better sign new people, you have sacrificed 99% of the roster.
Roman is in the midst of a historic run. There was no reason to make him drop the title before hitting 1000 days. The Bloodline story still has legs left. Maybe just bad timing for Cody, because he’s been great. The right man won though.
Never heard crowd quiet since undertaker lost too Brock lensar at WM 😂😂 I’m glad tribal chief won he get that 1,000 day reign as champion
What the hell man. This was Cody's match. Roman keeping the belts is just boring now.
Literally the worst ending.
Terrible editing in the vid👎👎
Once again another underwhelming and disappointing wrestlemania. Night 1 main event was better and the IC match was the best on night 2. Roman is boring as champ it’s time for someone else
Nah that would’ve been a great ending with it all coming full circle having sami get his payback, helping Cody win.
رومان رينز اسوا شخص حمل لقبى الاتحاد
Terrible ending to this man 😅
bro cody wouldve won to without the interferance
Incrível, parece com alguns times brasileiros; sem o meu pênalti eu não consigo = sem ajuda eu não consigo.
Cody delivered with his performance he’s up there at the top but like HHH said Romans just on whole another level than everyone else
From long time Roman reign wins by cheating I am very disappointed always with the injustice of wwe Lots of times Roman would have been lost if management would have been honest
It's disappoint to watch  Roman's match anyhow at the end someone interrupts and makes Roman to win.
Roman with the belts is a reason I don't watch. I just skip to the end to see him win. Not worth my time
Everyone mad about Cody not winning 😂😂😂😂
3:06 it's not the guy that baron corbin made him eat dog food?
Cody will be jobbing to Theory soon.
Worst. Finish. EVER. I'd rather watch Brock break the streak on repeat forever than to think about how badly this played out. Booking behind the curtain should be ASHAMED of how badly they did Cody
So WWE did their usual game plan. They push Cody to main event wrestlemania but have him lose to reigns. It looks like another 6 months of bloodline vs cody,Owens and zayn 😴😴😴😴. Let me guess Brian Cage is going to the WWE and will be the next guy to challenge reigns for the championships. I really hope jay white doesn't go to the WWE,they'll push him and then bury him
Acknowledge him☝🏿
It's time to striped those titles i have enough of this tribal hog
I hate how predictable this sport is
Reigns 💪💪👑, haters you'll die😂😂
its wasnt a fairytale ending lol but i love cody
Who is left to beat Roman?
I predicted, he is no match to Roman !!! How was it ?? I'm going to watch🤩
People should have just throw their cups in the ring, I'm very disappointed with WWE and their mediocrity for the past years. Cody Rhodes what there chance at redemption and they've wasted it like with sting. Stupid writers stupid owners.
If those idiots didn’t interrupt Cody would’ve won but no as always they cheat Roman will eventually lose those titles and i can’t wait for that to happen sick and tired of seeing him holding them 😂
Yall keep talking like cody just aint come right frm a competitive company n try n come back to wwe to “Finish the story” well ig he might aswell go bck again cause the story is finished now as always 😂😂😂😂 unlessss roman “Accidentally loses the title in a bs match”
He's had it for  sooo long. It's now a joke
Damn good match I thought Cody was going to take it but they probably have a storyline in place to get him title
Why did Roman win when Cody was at his best and with the whole Universe behind him. Idc about Roman’s 946 day reign, idc about you guys wanting to make a headline about Roman hitting a thousand days, or about the stupid bloodline. When it was time to pull the trigger with Cody… You should have pulled it
I would say “God help us all”, but Roman Reigns IS God.  There’s nothing we can do.  WWE is dead to me now.
He didn’t complete the story but it continues. Now we will get an actual rivalry out of this, and Cody’s chase for the championship begins, similar to Daniel Bryan’s chase for the title with the authority
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Horrible ending. Come on WWE you know who should have won this match. Big-time missed opportunity
What a garbage match!
boooooring
I am getting sick of this type of wins....  Good match but frustrating ending.
If not cody... then who
Cody needs his mentor... The Viper, Apex Predator, Legend killer to beat Roman at Summerslam
It was obvious that they new ppl assumed Cody would win so they’re gonna keep Roman champ still and not do the obvious script
Eres mi favorito  Román  pero cody es mi favorito  ahora
Roman cant win without help kmt
WWE BEING WWE BROCK WILL BE THE NEXT CHAMPION.... AGAIN 👎🏽🤦🏽
So no one will ever beat Roman. Got it
I’m getting sick of the bloodline always interfering with everything. They constantly getting involved to help Roman win. Roman and Solo sure didn’t get involved when jimmy and Jey lost on Saturday. I wonder why 😒
UFC and WWE just merged.
Cody Rhodes still would've won that match if there were no interruptions. I guarantee that. He has honor and is the people's hero. Even heros sometimes fall but, if his story continues. He'll rise up again better to finish this chapter
completely disappointing ending, there was a history behind that rivalry and it was perfect to end Reigns reign here...
Wasted opportunity - but another Reign to beat a record
The result of this match made all of this hype completely pointless. Even if cody is to win the championship at all now is gonna be unfruitful. Should have happened last night. Nows there's almost no way to "finish the story"
Is Hunter last name Mcmahon?
never felt so deflated
i swear roman has a twitch to kick out at 2.99 without fail
Now watch..Reigns loses on Monday Night Raw lol.   Glad he won!
lmao wwe blindsiding everyone by making reigns retain, could had instead let zayn win and had a better story rather than the predictable plot w owens... oh well
Very wrong decision. why they still let this man keep the belts is beyond me
WWE is starting to burry the AEW in this match.
Beautiful
F*** this company
What a weird ending. I love roman but now nothing makes sense
😂
Trash
Vince Is Back. Vince Changed the Outcome of The Match Mid Show. Triple H did not look Happy, His Months of work down the drain. A Main Event that was originally supposed to include Roman Reigns, Cody Rhodes, Jey Uso, Jimmy Uso, Solo Sikora, Rikishi, The Rock, Paul Heyman, Dustin Rhodes, Triple H, Kenny Omega, Matt Jackson, Nick Jackson, Luke Gallows, Karl Anderson, Don Callis and One More Suprise was canceled by Vince, Dwayne and Roman.   It was Long Shot that Option 1 Would Happen, but it was being worked on between Hunter and Tony.   Option 2 by Hunter would not include Rikhisi or The Rock. However Dustin Rhodes, Randy Orton, Ted DiBiase Sr and Jr would help Cody. This Option was turned down by Vince 2 weeks ago.  Option 3 would include Dustin, KO and Sami. This would lead to a rematch tonight.   My only thoughts are maybe Vince wanted a bigger unveiling tonight on Raw, maybe Vince has Killed Judgement Day.
just bring the rock already thats the one they really want to beat roman
they should do a rematch with no interfercenes.
Calma ragazzi .. Cody vincerà,  è lui il prescelto
They totally messed that up
It was Cody’s moment
Wwe make this right and tonight on raw we get the rematch with Cody winning
Acknowledge the tribal chef Cody hail to the tribal chef!!!!!
I would just like to know does Roman reigns ever win a game?
So they tease the Bloodline may start to crumble if the Usos lose the tag belts, then when they do, its nah, business as usual with them. I see the time honored tradition of vindictive booking continues with Triple H. MJF should take note and stay put when his contract goes up, cuz the WWE always has to get their petty payback.  🙄
If the Usos couldn't have interfered Cody should have won but I feel the fall of Roman will be epic and I think Samy or KO will end Roman's streak
Is anyone else getting fed up with the same old results in any Roman reigns match
☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️
im pissed off that roman won
Eight minutes of highlights and you don't even show the finish? Come on man...
Cody should have won. Typical WWE.
👏👏👏👍👍👍☝️☝️☝️
Ruin all thanks to solo sikoa
😂😂😂 u deserve to lose I'm so happy you lost didn't earn anything now go back to mid card star dust
The Head Of The Table Will Reign.☝️
this is like reading a spiderman comic. they just want eternal misery for fans.
Roman is the best ☝️☝️☝️❤
rematch at backlash the ref fast counted
The worst ending WrestleMania ever👍. WWE gonna be WCW 😂
I saw the whole match on peacock and phenomenal
The guy that comes out 2Nd is always the winner. Been that way for years.
I must admit I dropped off since McIntyre's epic run during COVID but ... CODY SHOULD'VE F'N WON!!!! WTF man?!?!?
Los Angeles definitely acknowledges you tribal chief ☝️
This was a good fight but roman winning was upsetting If he goes to 1000 days im just going to stop watching its been boring since the 100th day
Absolute BS the bloodline story line has more than run its course. It was good and entertaining for awhile but we need something new move on.
Really triple h he loses like that
I think we can all agree this was THE time to end the historic title reign and put someone new over , i think wwe made the wrong choice by letting roman retain ( could be because of the sale ? )
Sami zayin 👎💩
It's really annoying. What "enormous creativity" do these WWE authors have? Every time he wins the match by stealing thanks the support of cousins, parents, advocats... He's less believable than a drunked actor, more boring than a bad film... Please, change this ripetitive boredom! Just my 2 cents. (sorry for my english)
🍅 🍅🍅
WWE
Everything roman reigns beat cody Rhodes whit help thé bloodline
WWE RIP
Wwe wtf
The fact that the show Luke Harpers son as well as Brandi Rhodes is crazy
CODY ROBBED. R.I.P WWE
Haters !!!Tribal cheif is God mode !! Acknowledge him now even tribal h said so!!!
WWE is literally out of options now for next WM. The only thing they could plausibly do is a triple threat Roman Cody Rollins.
The story isn't finished, Cody will win those belts one day! It was a great match
Cody did an excellent job was so sure he had it but Roman won🎉🎉🎉
As a WWE, how do you alienate your viewers? It's as simple as letting that vague and incapable Mr. Reigns win once again. It's really no longer worth spending the money for major events on PayTV. I'll save the money in the future. What a pathetic spectacle.
I just unfollowed wwe everywhere and blocked every single wrestling account i know. I’ve been watching since i was 8 years old and even at the peak of my love for wwe, never was I this hurt about a loss. Good job wwe.
I am glad that Roman Reigns retained his titles
In my house opinion, even though I wanted Cody to win so bad, I was really clear that he was no match for Roman... I don't even feel like roman was in his full element.. I'm just saying
im having Jay White to beat roman for the belts he signs with wwe
That pop on Cody's entrance
Gruppo di Roman no good ! Man a Man two  Abito !!!!!
Big middle finger to the fans basically. WWE has a good rep with that.
so when is the last time ranes won a match by himself?..(and ya i know how to spell rains)… undertaker NEVER needed any assistance to win all those matches right? but wrains ALWAYS needs help to win because hes a chump NOT no champ…werd
The ending was bloody bollocks
First time I think of not consuming WWE products anymore
Only reason why roman rings won it’s because solo Secola did his finishing move because I watch wrestlemania
WWE knows how to run a moment. I don't care anymore.
Roman win was ok for me , but the ending sux
they did too good of a job with this storyline to let it end the way it did. i guess it will be a steel cage rematch for Summer Slam
I love WWE. Build em’ up then they lose.   Cody left them and built a rival company called AEW. Did anyone really thing they’d let him have his moment at WrestleMania? 🤣 this happens every time! 😂
One day soon it will be awesome when one day he asked the crowd to acknowledge Him and then his opponent shoot him the double Birds
This show smelled like Vince McMahon all over...
The story makes sense for Cody to lose. He cut a promo on Solo telling him how he isn't ready to be champion, therefore Solo took that to heart, attacked Cody, and cost him the championship.
Roman wins again due to help. The story line of wwe is just sad anymore.  Let that dude go. You can tell by the crowd. Nobody wanted Roman to win.
☝️☝️☝️
Roman Wins Again. I can't say i'm surprised, they're gonna have Roman be Champ longer than Bruno Sanmartino at this point. He's not far off of breaking Hogan's 3 year reign as champion.   I'm at the point where every Pay-Per-View I look at the card, and no matter the matches I can safely go: "Roman Wins." Even this match, I told people: "Everyone wants Cody to win to complete the generations old story. That's why Roman will win, because it sets up more of a feud for him and Cody so WWE can make more money off it."  No one's taking the belt off Roman. They've buried everybody that they've put in front of him. The only way he loses it is if he gets injured or in trouble.
Regarding what Cody Rhodes said to Roman Reigns in his promo and I quote"Roman has to wake up and feel what it's like to lose. And when that happens Jey is gonna leave you, than Jimmy gonna leave you, than solo is gonna leave you, than Paul Heyman goes back to being an advocate. You'll be a Roman with no more Reigns, a chief without a tribe." Thaty
Why on earth would yall want Cody win? He came back after years and they wont make him beat the face of the company
And after all of that Romen still won. Seriously WWE WTF ar you doing.
sorry Cody, you aren't samoan enough.
This was the closest they came to dethroning Roman. All they need is another person to take care of Solo.
Congratulations to Roman Reigns for his historical 1000+ day title reign. Then Congratulations to Cody for winning the championship with LONG TERM STORY TELLING.   Remember Johnny vs Ciampa in NXT 3 seperate ppv we all thought Johhny would win but lost. And the 4th and final PPV he was gonna win but Ciampa got injured and he won vs Adam Cole?   Give it time guys
Horrible ending
AHAHAHAHAHHAHA LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
got to say....think that was the wrong finish.
I don’t like Cody’s theme song.
At the beginning I thought Brandi’s face and body language gave the match results away 😂
Ya me tiene harto ese man de román reings nisiquiera merece ser campeon sin ayuda
One of the greatest Wrestlemania main events ever. The best result possible. The only way to make it greater was to have the Rock come down and screw Cody rather than recycling Solo. That is the only minor issue I have with the finish. Im so glad WWE had the balls to go with this finish. Its the best for business finish and it has longevity to it where you know the audience will remain glued to the show. This is only the beginning of Reigns' terror, and it's beautiful. I wanna see the bloodline grow even bigger and become the most dominant stable of all time. Why people are against it is beyond me.
This is going to be remembered years to come not jut because its wrestlemania but because o the wreslting GODS Goddamnit  i acknowledge my two fa wrestlers for giving me the best memory,match and wrestlemania   ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Arigato,gracias, thank you so freaking much
Just came here to dislike this lol
At some point, my tribal chief’s reign will come to an end, but when it happens, I rather it be from Cody, not the (🤢🤮) Canadians.
Solo dikos problem and jey and jimy
WWEgos at it again. Way to ruin  a Wrestlemania main event.
Roman is the face others are just omos 🤣
The downfall of wwe. It's really boring now
That Crowd was so Quiet  having Roman to win  The match was great and all but Roman Winning?..  Men! everyone was rooting for Cody Rhodes men
How its Cody Rhodes given a title shot? What has he been doing in the last 18 months? Hasn't fought top 5 on any platform. So again how was this possible?
Roman cant win a match alone
Roman Is the goat what did u think
Roman Reigns always have his cousin help Cody Rhodes should rematch aside Hell in a Cell!
Everyone is complaining. I wanted Cody to win as well. But I see what they are setting up. Having Roman handle business and not the usos. Which leads to him questioning them. Turning into him antagonizing them until they turn on him. This will lead to his ultimate demise. This was a huge curveball. Even though nearly everyone was expecting Cody to win. How great was it that they led us in one direction and threw us into another?
Straight corny man. They blew a chance to blow the roof off the building… I’m Done ✅
Thank you WWE for once again failing the WWE Universe. We are tired of Roman acting like he earned his spot; his mic skills are hella stiff and he may as well be a walking script because he has no creative mindset to change the ridiculousness the writers produce. John Cena should've buried Roman
Thats the most bad weestlemania evr for codey rodes and john cena 💔😢
They screwed up on this one, plain and simple.
Cheat,that's  the only way Roman keeps his titles.
Horrible ending what a way to ruin the  match and ppv
It was the same thing for Drew, Rollins, Samy and now Cody
get out H
Sets it up nicely for the disintegration of the Bloodline when Solo challenges Roman for the title
Cody tearing up holding his daughter. What a moment. He deserves all the success he is gonna get. This match was magical.
I watched this with my homies who don’t watch wrestling and I gave them a little backstory behind the match. needless to say by the end we were all at the edge of our seats screaming genuinely every time Cody looked like he was about to win. that says enough about how amazing this match was, which followed with absolute heartbreak at the end.
It’s getting boring seeing roman win
Idc how Triple H wanted to try and spin it at the press conference. You weren’t going to get a more golden moment than this and they sacrificed it to keep padding Romans stat book. That’s all this was about, that’s all it’s been about for months.   This makes early super Cena look like kids play. I don’t think even John held a belt for damn near a thousand days straight.
A solid storyline and a solid match. But yes, the lack of creativity in the finish hurts the match overall.   They kicked Solo out only to have him return to cost the match. Really? That’s how you end Mania? That’s like a Monday Night Raw finish, not Mania.   I’m ok with Roman keeping the belts because it was genuinely shocking, but the execution was weak storytelling.
The hate for Roman is real in these comments it just show how good he has gotten over the years…..  # BLOODLINE
who's dumb idea was it to have roman win?
Oddsmakers were way wrong. Cody was -550 to win. I don’t see anyone that can take the belts off Roman. Maybe Cody at Summerslam. That’s about it. They need to ban the Bloodline and Wise Man from ringside. Or do it in a Hell in a Cell.
Yeah… Cody had it…
They made the right call. Not because Cody doesn’t deserve to win, but because it’s not the right time. It is all in the chase for the fan favorite wins. It is going to be truly epic when the day comes Cody finally finishes his father’s dream.
Mpov: wwe makes roman reigns look like a big baby who cannot win his own battles. Even though he could make it. It is not about family, is about self-respect.
WWE board won not roman, it's clear that over and over again that roman cannot win without the help of his family, I wonder how this will continue if every wrestler will have his family by the side to help whenever they are in a match then I think there will never be a winner. The sooner WWE realize this the better its becoming more like a drama
WWE sucks💩
Well I'm predicting Cody Rhodes and Roman Reigns story will end in a Hell In Cell.
945 days....AND COUNTING
Roman has truly entered God mode. Winning 3 wrestlemania main events back to back againts the likes of edge Daniel brayan Lesnar and now cody
I mean This should have been the perfect time to change hands ,don’t get why the wwe let him keep it ..getting old at this point
AND STILL ☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾
Si sapeva che vinceva Roman con l aiuto dei suoi cagnolini e con guarda caso l arbitro viene sempre colpito i cagnolini ne approfittano e l arbitro dopo conta piano incontro fasullo doveva vincere Cody e avrebbe vinto e Roman perso come sempre succede guarda non ti viene neanche da vederlo perché sai che succede sempre la stessa storia
God forbid they give the belts to someone else
It's for others, triple H's ideas have run out, he will leave those championships won by cheating for eternity 🤮
disappointed with my show
I just knew Cody was losing. They wouldn’t know what to do with a Reigns THIS strong but without a title on him. Not at this point.
I don't want to hear WWE fanboys crapping on AEW booking anymore. WWE has been consistently awful outside the Sammy/bloodline stuff.
The TribaL Chief ❤🏴‍☠️🥊
TOTTALY DISSAPOINTING, ROMAN HAS HOLD THAT TITLE TOO LONG AND CODY RHODES SUPPOSED TO BE THE NEW UNDISPUTED UNIVERSAL CHAMPION. SHAME ON YOU "HHH" "WWE"
Greatest Wrestlemania of all time
I get they’re siblings but damn Solo and the Usos look exactly like each other in the face😂
I counted on Romen from the very beginning is and will be the king of the WWE
Historical Run Or Not Roman Couldn't Get It Done Without Help Cody Almost Had It In The Bag Good Match SMH But Damn
I was so hopin rhodes would beat him
That cody theme music is just a vibe
This will be one of the most regrettable mistakes under TripleHs 'Reigns'
Head of the table!
Roman not strong, his cousins help him every time! Why.........? Why did like this....?😂😂😂😂😂 Not good to play and Seen!😜😂😂😂😂
I’d stopped watching WWE id Roman 😡 lost
We all knew Reigns was gonna retain for now. I'm sure a rematch will happen eventually
I knew the Bloodline was gonna help Roman win. They piss me off!
Not many folks cheering at the end there. Biggest advert for AEW they could have done.
Y'all wanted Roman to loose lmao 🤣😂
0:25 ok homelander calm down
I'm tired of Roman always winning.i hope Cody will win the next time.
I wish RR could retain WITHOUT the help of his family...
Wwe is dumb for not giving the title to cody
This is why i watch highlights lol
Why don’t we just stop watching? that was really hurt, Roman and Triple H no fans no money no dreams shattered
Cody Rhodes please back AEW .. You deserve Champ ..
I used to like Roman but cheating ain't right be a man and take it one on one Cody should have that belt
Me staying up to 5am to watch Cody rhodes lose…thanks HHH
There was no better way For Roman to loose his title that loosing it to Cody Rhodes it was the perfect atmosphere  How can they even restore from this fail
Absolutely disgusting booking
Cody losing was the correct decision, if somebody is to take down the bloodline it has to Sami. Incredible match loved both of their perfomances. I supported Cody the whole match but i know deep down this story ends with Sami Zayn and Roman Reigns...
Ngl I think Roman's overrated.
It’s suppose to b Bobby taking the titles from Roman think about it and wat he accomplished this Roman BOBBY COMING FOR YOU
roman cheats
Triple H plsss just make someone to dethrone Roman reigns pls pls pls do it
Good job cody
Sami and Ko story is complete but Cody Rhodes story isn’t
No story finished
Worst possible ending why build him up like that to have him lose? Bro could have been the big baby face and they ruin it
Ya ya 1000days of champion so Roman must win..
I Think Roman Still Wins The Undisputed Universal Championship
81,000 + people Millions at home WrestleMania, what gets bigger than WrestleMania  This was the perfect night to end this story A banger of a match And a let down at the end This Mania was supposed to make the haters go shush but the ending opened their mouths again I'm still super let down Any wrestling game I play I remember this match
I suppose if you don’t like Roman then WWE just isn’t for you… Because it’s nothing but Roman. All Roman, all the time… Always! 🤦🏻‍♂️👎🏻👎🏻
I hoped for RKO outta nowhere
Seems like I'm one of the only ones who thinks that they handled this correctly. Cody came back, got injured almost instantly, was out for a long time, returned and instantly won the rumble. It would have been too soon. I mean what has he done to deserve this? Give him some time too establish himself a little more and then you can pull the trigger. Let Reigns hit the 1000 day milestone and see where things go from there. Not every story needs to have a happy ending. Especially when it feels kinda rushed.
so much people in the comments section angry 😂😂, you all believe in too much fairy tale, in real life we don't just win we have to lose and learn before we can win ,and why would they make Cody just win like this when you all were expecting it ?
Román nunca será como la rock que no necesita ayuda para ganar un título o retenerlo, si no intervienen su pinche familia ese no gana pero no la hora.
Cody’s gonna leave wwe again watch
Roman sucks
Bloodline team up together to beat Cody, So sad Roman reigns can't win any match again without the help of his cousin
You'd expect the theme song to be on level with the star but not codys 😂
Honestly the biggest fumble in wwe history is not giving Cody the belt. Be serious are we really supposed to care about a title being held for over a 1000 days? I mean yea definitely a hardworking milestone but I’d rather not have the same champions hiding behind the same comrades to win just like every other damn ppv we’ve seen
See this how WWE lose people. The greatest group the 4 Horsemen even Ric Flair during his reigns as the Heavyweight Champion lost to keep the value of the Championship so valuable. I like Roman but WWE has over played the so called God Mode unbeatable champion just like WCW ruined itself with the NWO gimmicks. Cody should have become the new champion in building the value of the titles and the company.
it has been a long time i feel the adrenaline watching wwe..
This is the reason I quit watching wrestling. Roman Reigns is why to hyped by WWE.
Look, this was a great, chaotic, nail-biter of a match. It felt huge. I was fascinated throughout.   Rhodes was operating at a peak. A great face to root for at every turn. Roman lived up to all of his self-hype. That moment of him on the mic alone was pure platinum.   The action was intense. Every move meant something. It felt consequential.  And the ending? There was no way short of Cody in tears holding his family and the crowd carrying him out in a Christ pose that would have been satisfactory.   Roman winning like he did was really a win for Cody. Roman’s heat will now be nuclear. Cody will be a new face up there with Hogan and the Rock.   This is how it had to end. Long run, this was best for the fans.
Wwe now sucks, i cant believe now even in wrestlemania der is still interference, , is totally absured, i guess it is good for bizness...solo dismantle cody at last
The last legal moment shown was reigns in the figure 4.Fucking highlights. What was the finish? 🤨
What a Vince McMahon style ending.
We are sad, we are mad, we are dissapointed, but they wouldnt book cody to lose if they dont have a even greater story to tell down the road... the revenge of Ellsworth. unifying all titles (yes, even female tag team title) by winning them all at 1 single PPV. book it now thank me later xD
☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾
Que final más triste lo mismo de siempre
Why do they keep copy and pasting Roman's title matches? This was just the same as the match with McIntyre is Cardiff. Ref goes down and Solo saves Roman. Both times McIntyre and Rhodes both deserved the win and earned the win.
Dumb dumb decision to let Reigns win - completely disappointing - so annoying that the worst booking decisions always come at Wrestlemania
No ...why is roman still champion. That was cody moment to become champion
Forever.Roman.Reigns.
We want cody rhodes dor champion!!!!
Man this is not the same like the Good Old days i can tell you who's going to win without even going to the event 🤷🏻‍♂️ its gotten to "This is awesome" to "This is Boring" Like 0-100 real quick 😂😂 WWF FOR EVER 💪🏼💯
Siempre gana haciendo trampa
roman is rubbish All time winner
Cody cutter lmfao they change name for moves like it ain't nothing that's the diamond cutter..give me a break
People need to understand WHY Cody lost. WWE wanted Reigns to reach a 1,000 days that’s literally about it. Cody should’ve won.
The only reason Roman win is because they want him to hit the 1K day mark as champion. I thought Brock Lesnar had a long reign but this is crazier.
My God, Roman Reigns can't retain the belt without help from others, WHAT THE HELL OF CHAMPION IS THIS?!?!?!
HHH SUCKS!
Worst possible decision Roman suck
this match is suck
Roman reigns will never ever be better than The Rock and any other Attitude era Wrestler ever. Fucc off you wanna be.
People are missing the point. The way I see it, this end with Jey Uso.  Second, last night was about Solo. This was his revenge on the only man that was able to beat him so far. And honestly, they should keep his streak a little longer. Watch him after the match. He didn’t do it for Roman. He did it for himself.  That being said, Cody will eventually win it, and he deserves it.  I didn’t think this was the moment.
Cody had cheater Roman
It was a missed opportunity not to have Randy Orton interfere in the match in some way. Would have been epic if he came back bald and baby faced like back in 09
This sucks.. roman, roman...
This win makes roman look weaker bc it tells us that he can’t win without cheating I said that back at Roman Reigns versus Brock Lesnar last standing match he's still weak then and even weaker now because he had to cheating both times to win what a week Victory the item both opponents the shop art is Cody Rhodes it's weaker opponent compare to Brock Lesnar I hope they give Cody Rhodes a rematch of the following next pay-per-view and yet the winning just like what they did Randy Orton versus Triple H at WrestleMania 25
Cody never deserved to even be in the match. It should have been Sami
One of the worst endings in wrestling
Rom i you god hahaha no1
Acknowledge him!! And kiss his tribal.......😅😅😅😅😅😅😅thank you Roman! Thank you Roman!!
WORST decision wwe ever made .....
Grass is always greener on the other side
I'm glad Roman beat Cody. I'm sorry but for Roman's reign to end by the hands of Cody doesn't sit well with me considering everyone Roman has beaten...
I think Randy is returning today and challenging Roman reigns
Roman suck!
It’s not even that Roman won that made this match suck, it’s that once again he had to cheat to keep the title. What was the last match he won by himself??
Shane McMahon snoop and miz was cheezy and lazy
I honestly hope they don’t make Roman give up the titles himself.. I wanna see someone beat him for them but I don’t even know who they want to beat Roman at this point.
I’m just so baffled why The Usos dropped the belts tbh. I thought they’d all go down
Acknowledge the greatness ☝️
Cody should be the one to dethrone Roman Reigns  For once WWE listen to your fans not your heads…
How I Would’ve Booked Wrestlemania 39:   Night 1:  WWE Championship: Cody Rhodes vs Roman Reigns   Raw Women’s Championship: Naomi vs Bianca Belair  United States Championship: John Cena vs Austin Theory  WWE Tag Team Championship’s: Kevin Owens & Sami Zayn vs The Usos *Tornado Tag Team Extreme Rules Match*  Women’s Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Natalya vs Nia Jax vs Raquel Gonzalez vs Liv Morgan vs Shotzi vs Dana Brooke vs Sonya Deville vs Rhea Ripley  Bray Wyatt vs Edge  LA Knight vs Stone Cold *Street Fight Match*   Night 2:  Universal Championship: The Rock vs Roman Reigns   Smackdown Women’s Championship: Aj Lee vs Tamina vs Auska  Intercontinental Championship: Brock Lesnar vs Sheamus vs Gunther  Women Tag Team Championship’s: Trish & Lita vs The Bella Twins vs The IICONICS vs Dakota Kai & Iyo Sky  Men’s Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Seth Rollins vs Logan Paul vs Braun Stroman vs Bobby Lashley vs The Miz vs Johnny Gargano vs Solo Sikoa vs Drew McIntyre   WWE Four Horsewomen vs UFC Four Horsewomen: Sasha Banks, Bayley, Becky Lynch, & Charlotte Flair vs Shayna Bazler, Jessemayne Duke, Marina Shafir, & Ronda Rousey   Rey Mysterio vs Dominik Mysterio *Hell In A Cell Match* <also if rey loses, he must retire>
Yall have an overfull roster of over athletes and yet only he, Gunther and uso hold the belts. So wtf is tye point of wrestling if no one else can have it. This isn't the 80s and 90s where the rosters weren't as heavy.
6:56
Yesssssssss I thought he was going to lose like the usos
Tontonan yg mengecewakan
WWE worst decision of all time
How long should reigns be the champion? Stupid decision 👎👎👎
Worst decision....also Roman can't win a match alone to save his life.
Bored
Forget the storyline, this was Vince or Triple H screwing the fans by not giving them the result they wanted, and screwing Cody out of the title just like Vince did to Lex Luger at Summerslam 1993 and at WrestleMania 10  in 1994. History repeats itself.
Why bring him back to lose 🤔
Trash finish, what's with the eternal force feeding of Joe's character by the WWE?
Finally! An unpredictable ending!  That was a cherry on top
Does anyone remember a time when the script had Reigns actually winning a match on his own?
again Sikoa, Again a rat kick, and again the referee doesn’t see anything, as a result, the belt is saved ........ I don’t know who can stop Roman🥺
Figured WWE wouldn't have the stones to take the title off Reigns.
Comunque sia non vince mai con solo le sue forze questo non lo farà mai un capo tribù, ciao buona Pasqua 🙏🏼☮️
Roman reigns is proof how corny wwe is. Hands down  one of the most overrated "wrestlers'  the story is dry
Suck
Garbage
roman reigns worst wrestler ever like coward
This was damn near predictable
The ending had Vince written all over it!!!!!!!! I cannot WAIT until he’s gone!!!!!
yessir… ACKNOWLEDGE HIM ☝🏾😎
Acknowledge the Tribal Chief 🩸💪🏻
Fans were quiet during a lot of the matches on night 2 tbh.
I feel sorry for every other champion caliber wrestler in the back waiting for a real shot while they got 2 belts on someone for a thousand days that no one cares about. Same old Ish over and over
Still the champion with all their cheating. This match need hell in the Cell next time and solo the usos and Heyman outside
I figured that Cody Rhodes did not win at wm 39 because Roman Reigns had to go take over the win and defeat Cody Rhodes as well and I am not surprise at all from Roman Reigns anyways !!
The worst wrestlemania ever
They are clearly wanting Roman Vs Rock for SummerSlam or WrestleMania 40 in Philly next year, no doubt about it now. Either him, or a returning Randy Orton.
This is confirmed that Vince is returned... 😢
So glad he didn't lose, I thought they where gonna give it Cody because they gave it to sami 🤦‍♂️
None of these guys got the real juice. They are all lame on the mic and everyone has lame finishers, music, almost everything. WWE will slowly die.
I miss the old Roman Reigns who didn't have to cheat in the match just to win or be a champion..
Cody is taking the titles at wrestling mania backlash
Roman❤❤❤❤❤
The right man won. We don't need Cody shoved down our throats
In my opinion Cody didn’t really deserve it, if he had a different last name he wouldn’t be booked as such
This story line is getting so old
I'm glad I pirated this show. I didn't waste any money on a terrible decision
Boring that reigns continue to be champ and that cena lost . Most bs wrestlemania of all time
Romain Menia
Don’t have a problem with Roman winning. Do have a problem with yet another Uso interference being the reason for it. Go home Vince!
Justice for Cody..... Triple H sucks to do this
I’m glad mid card stardust lost he would be a poor champion choice but nowhere near as terrible as MJ F in AEW
Roman reign shame on you u can't win this match w/ out ur buddys
WHAT THE HECK WWE.bro I’m so tired of roman being champ like wwe let Cody or someone else win the belts
It’s ridiculous that RR is still the title holder. It’s so long over due. WWE you dropped the ball. Again !
It was once in a lifetime moment....Wwe had to ruin it
I said before thet Cody Rhodes did not have the star power to beat Roman at WM. Nobody listened to me, but i knew this would happen. Roman will be champion for as long as Vince is in charge.
*I know we all love an unexpected moment but sometimes a deserving expected moment can be just as fire. I really wanted Cody to win, but this match was …. Good*
Had it in my head that Roman would lose the titles and slowly start to lessen his schedule to possibly start to get into Hollywood so that he could do movies
Can't believe cody didn't get the win ... really disappointed
Sick and tired of this part timer shoved down our throats and keeping the titles hostage. We could've had McIntyre fulfill his destiny at clash of castle; we could've had Rhodes fulfil his destiny at WrestleMania today but nope. Wwe is more interested in shoving the same Anoai-ying nonsense down our throats.
Garbage can’t believe it
Alright back to stardust Cody, you will never be a top guy, you are always a midcard guy and just accept it.
Reigns can't win witHout help from his cousins!!!!!!....what a fake he is!!!!
Bro I'm telling without roman regins wwe is nothing that why their pushing roman regins
I’m no longer invested in this story. It really sucks.
Romans starting to get annoying at this point, so overrated
Wait, Roman actually won?
Just goes to show how HHH has no creativity. He is head of creativity  and yet they still will not let anyone besides rings have the belts.    Come on, really?    Pathetic ibmnce again.  Maybe their rating would start to climb again if they had a new champion?
I thought for a second the rock would come out at the end of their match to challenge roman
Como siempre roman gana con ayuda nunca es legitima sus peleas son apañadas
Wwe what sport
I now going to stop watching wwe
So stupid
Roman suck
I am astonished by the amount of people that didn't see this coming. It's already been established in the last few PLE's that Roman can't win without the bloodline. We already know the bloodline is on the precipice of falling apart. Especially since the Uso's didn't retain. The bloodline has always been the reason he wins, so they need to be the reason he loses too. The collapse is just beginning, they couldn't have him lose yet. I agree the pacing of this story is slow but to act like Cody was a lock just tells me people haven't been paying attention. The answer is in the promos.
Do y’all really think Cody would’ve left aew if he didn’t know he would eventually be wwe champion? He’ll win it eventually hopefully next year the build up would be crazy I wish they could just split the titles and have Roman stay universal and keep breaking title reign records
We love you Tribal Chief ☝️❤️❤️. You are Wrestlemania.
I could see Cody winning it at the next 'Mania. Even John Cena got redemption against the Rock and won. So I'm all for another year-long buildup.
This sucks 😔
What an absolute BS finish. I'm done with this storyline now. Enough is enough. Worst booking I've seen so far.
Cody ain’t the one
A lot of people didn't like this ending, i disagree. The story needs to be longer. Cody just beat Seth 3 times in a row and won the rumble, and the story just gonna end just like that? Nah, this ending is good imo. Cody will definitely get a rematch against Roman and complete the story on SummerSlam. The story NEEDS to be longer, not just jump into a happy conclusion/ending.
Kkkkoooooooooddddyyyy😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍😎😎😎👀👀👀👀👀
Can't capture a lightning in a bottle twice. You had it and you blew it. I hope you can write another story like this and people still care because I don't anymore.
Roman Reigns loser
Cody should 100% won this match. Screw the people that said Cody got everything handed to him and that it’s way too early for him to win the championship. This night was his night, and he was cheated.
Cada vez es más aburrido ver
LOL THE MARKS ARE BIG MAD LOL WELL DONE WWE ROMAN REIGN MUST CONTINUE 💪🏽
Can you tell me what sense it f****** made to have the Usos lose the tag titles and everybody was convinced that Cody was going to take the title from Roman
Idk why people are so shocked. Cody was never going to win, Roman has been the face of the company for years. Cody went to the rival company. He has to put the time back in.
Yeah roman got lucky again cheat as always
i thougt the reign is gonna be over tonight but no...
Why am I shocked he cheats to win
I can’t Believe Cody loss
Damm u hunter 😢
terrible match
I felt so happy i was waiting for this match for a long time here it is i'm so hyped rn
At this point the crowd will start booing for a new champion
Such of an idiotic end
For Roman if it wasn't his brothers Cody would have be the champion!
Who else thought that Cody was definitely winning yesterday??? 😢😢😢
It is boring
They got to stop doing the same thing in every epic match against Roman Reings ,this was the moment Of Cody Rhodes to win the Title  They killed the best chance for Cody  The saddest part is that Romans wins over a Samoan Spike by Solo !!  Really !!!?  After Cody being speard superpunch gillotine dobled super kick by usos and Cody losses over a Somoan Spike??? They just killed the full match in one moment   How are we suppose to Acknowledge a person who always wins with help !!!   Perfect moment for Cody to put the finished and they killed Cody momentum   That’s what make people quit watching wwe
This is just set up perfectly. Everyone expected Rhodes to win, he lost and now we get a redemption arc set for next year, which will garner him a bigger pop As a baby face. This is absolutely incredible booking in my book reigns is been booked as the difficult boss to beat. Love it!
So at the script of wwe, roman reigns will always be the champ?
This was a spectacular match, but bad ending as most people said. Good storytelling around for a 30+ minute match but the typical way that Roman has won his matches via Bloodline interference just sapped the stadium of energy once the "1,2,3" count occurred. This was a finish that had me dumbfounded as the hype was around Cody and seemed like a perfect opportunity to finally show the weak spot on the dragon that is Roman. Only this time it wasn't happening and now that practically the entire roster has been beaten over a 2-year reign (too long and boring of a storyline) what else is there? This championship might just become an nWo-like albatross in the end and if Cody or someone else does wrestle those belts away, it may be too late to do so. A 1000-day reign as champion is a nice idea, but when there's no continual showing of weakness such as a non-title loss or showing Roman can win cleanly, the fans will just lose interest in the end
Solo gana con trampa
🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆🖕😡
Roman still the best roman my favorite in wwe
Almost 2 years Roman reigns has been champion and it’s getting annoying
Man I wish Cody won Breh
by far WWE again defeated the fans. and by far the suckiest move by Vince and Hunter.
Maybe HHH doesn't want the story to end quite yet
Sami, Ko, and Cody new faction? Should happen in my opinion and they go against the bloodline to see who is the most supreme team
Cody just got buried. Time to go back playing STARDUST KID 😂😂😂😂
When you realize that drew and sami got the same they will defeat reins hype up but still roman beats them all
ali limane/ ce Roman a fait intervenir sa troupe, je savais que Kody ne gagnerait pas dans cette circonstance 4 contre un, + la direction avec lui.  cela est impossible que quelqu'un puisse le battre. Normalement lorsqu'il s'agit d'un match comptant pour la ceinture ces irrégularités devraient ne pas avoir lieux. Afin que tout le monde sache jamais la ceinture ne changera de mains dans les circonstances pareilles. Moi personnellement je savais que le commandos était en embuscade au milieu des spectateurs et interviendrait au moment propice, c'ait ce qui s'ait passait.
Looks like the only way Roman will lose the title is if he gets injured or sick.
only real champion cody rhodes
And just like that, WWE killed all their momentum
Don't believe to these matches , they are all fake.
There’s only one line and that’s the bloodline ☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽
Tbh the finish surprised me. And I still believe usos should have lost 1 title not both as they won the raw tag team after. And if roman loses he should lose 1 belt. Weakening him but keeping his streak. Setting up other rivalries of ppl trying to get his belt. Building momentum till he fights Cody again and then they can either have him win back his other belt or lose
I'm proud to see Cody rise up to 5 star quality superstardom. I always knew he was a special talent and would carry forward his father's legacy. Impressive stuff he pulls in the ring. That was an amazing match.
I'm sick of reigns. Wwe became boring
Ohh no :( roman wins
Thank god I cancelled WWE network when Roman won the first time
Some reasons Cody should’ve of not won:  1: ROMAN IS GOATED  2: Cody has had 7-9 matches since his return, already won the royal rumble to push him further to winning the gold without him showing any effort wouldn’t be fair  3: They tryna push roman reigns to 1000 days as champ  4: This bloodline feud and reign brings a lot of attention, revenue, and conversation to WWE, in turn making them more money  5: Creates more crowd engagement and atmosphere towards when he eventually loses it  6: Roman has beaten, Brock, bobby, john and drew and to be beaten by a deforested cody rhodes is stupid  7: Cody is an AEW boy, why would WWE allow him to pick up 2 prestigious titles  8: Usos already lost their titles, cant wipe out the whole bloodline on wrestlemania  9: Cody has not earned it yet tbh, he just returned out of nowhere a year ago and other wrestlers been grinding for years and years with no opportunity   10: WWE knows what they are doing with this storyline and how to create an even bigger ending
Fuera kevin dunn
Roman Reigns is being so stale and boring now that it's worst than his baby face character. Cody should have won and rhisbis coming from a Roman Fan.
Match of the century, I bet little people would agree with me here
I give up. We’re back to Hogan, where everyone is written to lose to that one guy three years in a row, HHH had a chance to make WWE something beyond the “everyone loses to Roman” WWE stale product we’ve had since the SHIELD broke up and Vince decided to make everyone a lame duck.
I think this might be setting up to be Roman vs Jey at Backlash or Summerslam. Because let's be honest Jey deserved it more Cody. Or maybe even The Rock might return and beat Roman. So don't lose your hopes guys.
Roman🐷💩💩💩💩💩
Honestly this was the first time in a decade I cared about Wwe. Now I will return to not caring
This is BS y’all really screwed up with this one
roman win yes
@Hey WWE here's an idea make Seth to be the one to defeat Roman Reigns once he reached his 1000 days and then make Cody beat Seth  so it will be full circle baby!!!!
What a garbage ending
Clearly Vince was behind this damn trash show last night  night 1 was better by miles
Super
Cody for the win at summerslam that's obvious, they are going to give Roman the record
Das darf doch nicht war sein hat der scheiß roman reigns schon wieder gewonn echt zum kotzen ich mag roman reigns nicht er ist scheiße und als wwe champion ist er langweilig 👎👎👎
7:10 listen to the music closely
They really wasted fans money
Roman deserved to retain But Cody should win the big one sooner than later
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
I’m done with you wwe.
You’d think WWE would want the highlights to be the best moments of roman during match Instead they showed you cody as the star in this highlight Goes to show  1. Roman is not being shoved down anyone’s throat it’s just business... This comment section is the EXACT reaction they hoped for😁 2. They are sticking to what sells.  Roman being like this makes him so hated  that the fans would support anyone ANYONE who has a chance of beating him, hence selling tickets and creating buzz... 3. You can hate all you want but the story is great... That’s why u in ur feelings like this😌 4. WWE can never run out of fans 😌 i personally would hv taken a break from WWE if Cody won...Because it would hv taken a while to get used to seeing TC without the belts(he carried it So well, gave it so much prestige. In my opinion) No bojo or part timing hall of famer can just challange for the titles now and that’s bcos of Roman. And there’s millions of fans like me.. Who would hv been devastated if Cody won.  So if u hv to... Go ahead and take a break... It’s not that serious... Y’all calm down...  You just don’t like the character roman  You are not supposed to  Calm down with all the i’m done with WWE 😂 You will still come back They have great stuff going on and we all know it when we’re not being overly emotional😁😁🤍 peace✌🏽
I felt my heart skipping multiple beats when he started to hit the Cross Rhodes-threepeat but here we are…
I think Cody Rhodes should have won
Complete utter Bs, that ending was, Cody has no right losing.
tribal cheat
Hiw come roman being a wwe star?he only had 3 movement.never jump from the top of the rope.
Again more of the same he can't win it fair then he ain't worth the time.  Bro is a bum!!!!!!!!!!
And I was talking highly of you wwe wtf
At the time I had written this comment this video was released six hours ago it already had 16k likes and 24 dislikes
Homelander
tribal chief whooooooo
That's will be a rematch
Roman is The Man
Triple threat match Roman Cody and the rock for the belts
I didn't like the ending.
I knew it. Too many spoilers before the match, hell some idiots showed a damn picture of the new Cody championship Belt... i think they changed plans just for this
That’s BS! I want cody
Cody was better with Stardust
WWE is fake fake fake fake Roman is plastic plastic plastic liar match liar events liar money is loved rude laughing
Just when thought he won they pull a fast one lol backlash will be interesting Mondaynight raw also
Guys I'm kinda asking here. Isn't WrestleMania supposed to be the crowning achievement and glory a WWE wrestler supposed to do?   If so why the climax isn't in this super special event? Why do it after this event? Maybe you should never tag a premium on WrestleMania at this point
Remach pls its nota correct
vince booked again
Roman was always vinces boy.. Just like when he beat taker at wrestlemania.. The result felt wrong again here. and a huge miss for Cody and the wwe fans... This would of completed the Cody story.
It was supposed to be a night of change. It was supposed to be Cody's night, they killed his dreams.
Now it's time for jey to betray roman and get the titles
Give one good reason why Roman reatined
Wwe has ruined every superstar’s moment to get the belts.
That’s Luke Harper’s son
Super very disappointed 😡😡😡
Wow wow wow... Usos, Paul and solo getting involved to help roman retain...NO ONE saw that coming what a shocking surprise....said no one ever....
Great Match, horrible  ending.
ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRIBAL CHIEF! ❤️❤️
Bruh unless they’re going to let bray take the belts off Roman who else is left . Cause I’d be damned if they let him fight Brock again
Cody needs to change his theme song
Roman should learn how to execute a SPEAR from Charlotte Flair. Now I'm not interested in how WWE continues this storyline going forward 😂😂😂
This. Is bull man
Well this sucks…
Cody’s a loser just like his daddy. lmao
He better win after the 1000 day mark he better get a figth against roman and win
I'm starting to believe he's just never losing it. I just sort of hate wrestling now.
He was supposed to win 🤦🏾‍♂️
The right man won
☝
Rko from ropes 😮😢
I was very disappointed in the match because like usual and is getting very boring now with Roman cheating as always to keep the belts. Cody had that match won if it wasn't for Solo, Paul and The Usos interfering like always. The Bloodline story is getting boring and so is Roman because he can't win a match without help. LOSER!
I pray to god that Cody wins at Summerslam and they have the right creative to keep building the story from tomorrow because this was so disappointing. Feels like a missed opportunity
we love you cody
Roman won because they didn't want the whole bloodline to lose at WrestleMania. Monday roman will talk his trash to how jey and jimmy lost. Then next big event Roman will lose his
This was the BEST Wrestlemania main event we had in a while!🔥 Probably one of the most unexpected finishes ever ( Almost had Brock Lesnar beating UT wrestlemania streak reaction)
Voilà comme d'habitude roman reigns triche toujours sa famille qui vient l'aider seul il peut rien faire c'est pas un champion mais un tricheur
I love Cody. He is a great performer.  But let's not forget that in one year, he has only won 3 ppv against Seth.  Won royal rumble. And a few other times on Raw. I would consider you naive if you'd thought he was going to beat Roman.
It seems Triple H has not forgiven Cody for smashing his throne.
Wwe directors sucks
Got damn this story is crazy good writers need a raise
If Cody doesn’t get another shot, WWE are just proving our points that they suck off roman way too much. He gotta win it for the family. They’re overrated Roman wayyyyyyyyyyy too much.
The finished was horrible
WWE proved again why they are dogshit. Back to not watching it. Brain damage to let Reigns win.
We are tired of boreman lames
The first 2 minutes belong to Cody. Fantastic entrance! family sweet moment! In match Cody performing Amazing wrestling moves remind some Randy Orton and must this 2 rebuild from ashes like Phoenix The Legasy
Como siemore gano con trampa 😡😡😡😡😡
Night one was ten times better than night two
Wwe sucks
"I'm gonna stop watching cause they didn't let my guy win" ☝️
Cody coming back and the belief of him winning got me excited to start watching again…
Cody should win this tittle but the finish very sucked . Roman afraid using solo to finish cody . Boo roman👎🏻
This is an awesome main event
Luke Harpers son got Cody’s belt. That’s awesome. I so hope the reign of Reigns is over
Randy will return at tomorrow's Raw to help Cody, Roman will lose at Summerslam.
Roman should have lost
Wrestlemania doesn’t feel as special anymore as to when I used to watch it (2000-2008). It should be one night show. Roman reigns main eventing WM every year looks like it’s gotten stale also. I thought that HHH being champ during the McMahon/Helmsley era in 99/00 was too long so god knows how having reigns as champ for this amount of time feels for today’s fans 👎
the like and dislike ratio says it all I think 15k/22k. wwe rly made the stupidest choice once again, right when u thought things were getting better
Seems like triple H wants Roman to go to 1000 days but we have gotta have a clean rematch between these 2 please man and make it so Cody wins
It was An American Nightmare for Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania. That's Hard Times Daddy!
even I can beat Roman, if he does not have interventions 🤬😡🤬😡
My guess is WWE have had guarentees from the Rock that he will be available to work a program with Roman later in the year so they've decided to keep the belt on him for that which in terms of long term storytelling would make perfect sense. Sucks for Cody though and I suspect the fans in attendance at tonights RAW won't be happy but it is what it is, a potential Rock vs Roman match will encourage potential buyers to get closer to that magical $6billion (or was it $7billion, I can't remember) that Vince is after and at the end of the day that is the sole purpose of WWE at the moment, to look as attravtive as possible to potential investors.
Roman Reigns & Sami Swoi nie nie 🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃
Okay we all seen that was coming
I’m sorry but that might be the worst ending in the history of Wrestlemania after Taker undefeated streak….
Heart goes out to Cody that he didn't get the moment he truly deserved, absolutely heartbreaking. Behind all the booking, it makes me truly sad for him that it didn't happen this night.  It has nothing to do with the fact that he's not the champion, just the fact that they built him up at this mega star(which he is), just to lose to basic interference like every other Roman title match. But they claimed it would be.. somehow different this time? At least the match itself was good, they told a great story, Roman basically dismissing Cody as a threat, and Roman knew he needed help(in kayfabe) by the end. Also him no selling two cross rhodes after the spike was just.. ugh.  Edit: If there's going to be a rematch in the future, it should absolutely have the stipulation that if there is any interference from the bloodline, Roman loses the title.(and of course if say kevin/sami interfere then rhodes loses) We've had that same end to all of his title defenses for so long(given he's a heel, it makes sense), but if he's really this "top dog" that he's made out to be, then they need to show that to us with the true 1 on 1 match, and if he wins, power to him, respect earned for the character he plays, if Cody wins, then it sends the message to the audience that Roman was indeed held up by the bloodline and that he was nothing all along.
Even the commentators wanted cody to win😂😂
W
Another Vince McMahon booking.
This was the dumbest decision that wwe has done lately the tension and hype was so high for Cody to win and everyone was ready for a new champion crowned new story’s rivalry’s for the wwe championship but no we’re going to have the same boring story as usual
this bloodline story has been the best thing going for a well over a year and they had the perfect chance to conclude the story at wrestlemania and have it be legendary, but they fumbled the bag in the most greed driven way possible.
Roman Reigns is a cheat. no respect for someone who needs to cheat ..
I think It's time to stop watching wrestling again
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Reigns is always a cheater why wwe didn't give it to cody your so selfish wwe
Vince is back
That’s life
Lol, just give the titles to Roman Reigns permanently.  Come up with a new title, maybe "Non Part Time Undisputed World Champion" or "Makes an Appearance Every Week Undisputed World Champion", or something along these lines, so that others have a chance to compete for it.
Either Cody is beating Reigns at Summerslam or Jey Uso is, I'm bummed Cody lost but, it likely would have been a Kofi Kingston like title reign and his story felt rushed in comparison to a near 1000 day title reign, if someone is gonna dethrone him, Cody either earns a rematch, or Jey Uso is the only other one with enough build and backstory who the crowd is invested in, who can take the title off of him.
Cordy Rhodes for me was the better man. He won for me. And Romans always wins because of those last minute helps
☝🏽🔥☝🏽🔥☝🏽🔥
☝🏽🔥☝🏽🔥☝🏽🔥
Title changes on the first night is great second night no title changes I guess 1 is better than none at all 🤷🏻‍♂️
☝🏽🔥☝🏽🔥☝🏽🔥
It's alright. Gonna be rematch Cody Rhodes Vs Roman Reigns at WrestleMania Backlash. Cody Rhodes Vs Roman Reigns or new opponent like Seth Rollins or Drew McIntyre or Edge or returning Superstar of Riddle and Big E Langston. Perfect match against Roman Reigns to take the title off from Roman Reigns it's Riddle or Jey Uso or He made his debut last year 2022 and attack Drew McIntyre and confrontation Roman Reigns and The Bloodline I don't know his name is Killer Kross.
☝🏽🔥☝🏽🔥☝🏽🔥
So disappointing. Cody should have won this match but once again Roman gets help and Cody has to fight 4 instead of 1. It's unfair in the most basic sense. Hell in a Cell rematch no bloodline allowed
-1 should have exchanged the TNT title he's holding for Cody's weight belt

nah bra somebody needa get the championships off Roman reigns 💯😂 im tired of it
Why is Cody so damn stiff did smth happen to him?
I knew the head of the table was going to win because he's got a hit over that thousand days as champion
Well done Roman!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Roman is doing a better job at blowing triple h. Roman has no shame. The world watch single cody was fighting 5 people. Romain has never won a fight without his family help. Wrestling is a money grab. Roman with his smug look is a coward. He has never fought a match by himseld. What a shame on the reins family. People were screaming for cody to win but i gues romain did a better blow to triple h. 🎉
Cody should've won. It was his time to honor his family's legacy.
@WWE i'm fighting roman for those tittles next, and he better get ready for me it's because it's ME!
This is why i stop watch WWE, starts very hype and end in stupid way, worst WrestleMania in 10 years ...
Romenring was worsted wwe player
honestly Cody should have taken the gold I was disappointed in the end
Roman suck
what was that short and funny match ? you didn't see the finisher or anything else.
The ending was so bad the fact cody had the win is ridiculous
Well back to the attitude Era clips
This made no sense, why are y'all keeping Roman as champion, we can't push the new talent I swear if he wins at summer slam I'm going to aew this just pisses me off
Cody deserved his wrestlemania moment no? It was just perfect
Poor wwe ...😢
WWE has officially ruined wrestlmania by having Roman not only win 2years in a row but have him cheat to do it like how much more predictable can you be
This storyline needs to end and let ANYONE else have the spotlight. It was good while it lasted but come on......
Roman is so boring i use to watch this as a kid with the likes of stone cold heartbreak kid triple h the rock and so on and am not being funny i enjoyed watching more for story last few months and really thought cody would win he has so much more than roman and connects with the fans .. tbh mi perfer watching the women theirs better like whats the word am looking am not sure theirs just something more and their better to look at especially liv Morgan what a goddes
yess roman retains!
The viper ....
This is the exact reason I stopped watching wwe
Wrestling bandwagoners don't know that the reason why wrestling ends like that at times where the heel is assisted shows that the challenger is on Par with the champion and doesnt make them look weak instead of being beaten outright. It allows for the story to continue.
the worst ending of a WrestleMania -100/10 what a mrd ending ;(
I love Cody but I understand why he lost because guys he just came back a year ago
I'm glad Cody didn't win He honestly doesn't have "IT". I don't see Cody having the title. The one to win against Roman(And end the Title Run)is Randy Orton.
Roman reigns greatest of his era acknowledge him🔥 great match for Cody
Yes Roman 💯💪💪💪
This was supposed to be Cody's moment.
You had just one Job triple H and wwe, Give Cody the title, it’s common sense
😂😂😂😂 I love all these cry baby Roman Reigns haters you obviously don't understand WWE at all why on earth would they let him lose the belts when his so close to a 1000 days. If Cody won yh it would be great for the moment but people would get so bored quickly. Roman is the perfect champion for the business because he is such a good heel he has made all the PPV profits triple fold because of that. So stop crying and acknowledge the tribal chief
Damn fatty ruined the day for cody 😡
I thought WWE was better than AEW in terms of storytelling than performance, but I was wrong. It was just all stupid.
This was a great match too bad Roman win Cody Rhodes should have won if it was not for Roman friends
He wins again with interference not surprised I thought he was gonna loose take a break as I read but nope didn't happen I don't know if he'll ever drop the belts people were saying Cody is gonna beat Roman
Greatest champ of all time acknowledge Roman reigns 🙏
Terrible terrible move. The fans fury and anger proves this. First serious mistake from Triple H. We - the WWE Universe are TIRED of seeing this story of Unbeatable Roman at this point. He’s great. We get it. But ENOUGH already. Watching this Superman doing the exact same thing over and over and over is now exactly like watching reruns. We were ready to turn the page and start the next chapter. But it looks like WWE is not. Huge mistake guys. You have let your fans down.
C'mon man....This  Roman thing got old a while ago.
Another miss smh
STUPID TERIBLE CHIEF ROMAN GAY REIGNS
This has officially reached late NWO territory
Roman cheat so bad
ROMAN REIGNS AND VINCE MCMAHON IS GAY
They need to give solo a title opportunity...
Wwe should be ashamed for the finish of the match
There’s no good stories if Cody wons he’s don’t have it like it or not he will never be as good as Roman regins he’s the last living legend he’s held it down since before Cody even left
Reigns a paper part-time entertainer. Not a champion, and certainly WWE has made it clear he can't win without outside interference. The women's title defenses make this match another embarrassing one.
Terrible ending.
You messed up the ending, why can’t the people get what they want for once?🤦🏾‍♂️
ANOTHER TRIBAL CHIEF W
There bury Cody now. He never get this push again
Jey better take those titles
barbell back squats.
Well I guess it’s back to a AEW
I feel bad for anyone who bet a lot of money for Cody to win
😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉!!!!!!!!!,,,,l.m so Glad he Won!!!!!!!!! Yeah!!!!!!!!!!
Lol to the Cody fan boys who say Everyone wanted Cody to Win. Where did you get your info.
Can someone tell me the last time Roman defended his title without help I know it's been awhile and it'll take some time to think but let me know I got all day!
Cody losing was the worst Wrestlemania decision ever. Worse than Hogan beating Bret.
Glad Roman Reigns retained his titles...a better champion
Is wwe gonna keep doing the same script over and over Usos interfere so roman retains shame on the fans as well for eating this garbage up
Cody is gonna win it eventually, it's inevitable
المصارعة قصص محبوكة مجرد تمثيل من أجل إثارة المشاهد الفوز لا يحدده المصارع بل الشركة في النهاية هم مهرجون استعراضيون
진짜 Sibal wwe보지 말라고 하는거냐? 그만 좀 해처먹어라 제발
Y’all mad
I don’t get it
Worst main event
I absolutely wanted Roman to retain. My friend told me Roman got no chance and now I'm laughing at him
Everybody expected Cody would win. WWE worked in this direction over weeks. To do the unexpected! In the past, everyone complained that it wasalways too predictable. It is not. Great Job WWE. And Cody, your Time will come. 🙂
Summerslam? 🤷🏿‍♂️
some people would lick romans boot and thank him. its sad half of the fans still support this bs 💀
If anyone actually thought WWE would dethrone Reigns, yall are dumb. WWE story lines have been so easy to predict the past 3 years. Tonight was a chance to get away from it, but nope. Every match went exactly the way you thought it would. Old wrestlers coming back to add a spark to the WWE. Have no business wrestling anymore. Slow. Can't hit their stuff. Miss. But nope. WWE has them win        Everyone knew Cody was going to lose because interference. It's how every Reigns match has gone the last years. It was just how they would write it in the script.
WWE nailed it. Just read the comments - hook, line and sinker.
Cry Cody fanboys
Seth will be the one to Drop Roman.
0:21 loved that ❤
f-U WWE your booking sucks.... You should be called RWC, Ruining Wrestlers Careers
STOP SCRIPTING MATCHES, CODY WOULD HAVE WON THAT MATCH IF IT WEREN'T FOR SOLO THAT FAT THING 😑
Believe me Roman Reigns will be buried with the titles
The usos helped out Roman because they are sore losers.
I really feel for Cody 😥I still love you
☝️☝️☝️☝️
The overrated poster boy wins again. Watching Roman Reigns "wrestle" is a yawn fest. I called this bs win weeks ago, the Usos loss sealed the deal.
The Rock will win the tittles at WrestleMania 40 ,
Cody Rhodes had job face on his entrance.
@WWE
Need a fair rematch please!!!
So disappointing.  It's time for someone new to be champion. Roman is boring
Cody should've won that match but because of SOLO , he didn't.
We want Cody to win his new WWE title. Not undisputed title.
☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽
Roman won again!  Who wants to take Roman away, you are a clown
wwe is becoming boring the more roman wins...
Роман полено
Cody looks like bryan fury of takken7
Roman rings cheated
For everyone saying "Cody should have won" he was rushed back too soon. I feel he wasn't 100% and even if he was, he hasn't had enough matches for the world title. The plan is to make Roman make history & reign for over 1k days anyway (which was my prediction a yr in a half ago, i was like the only one saying it lmao) why not make history which hasn't been done since the early 80s or late 70s? lmao grow up clowns. Cody lost tonight so he'll win at SS or at next yr's WM to complete his story. This was their first time fighting, had he won tonight it would've been predictable.   C'mon now, think about it. The rematch will be by far legendary, will complete the story & will be worth it when Cody finally wins in the end. Just like the lyrics of his song "My father said when I was younger "hard times breed better men" you took it all away, I gave it all away. Can't take my freedom. Here to change the game, a banner made of pain. I built my kingdom. Now you bow to me. You took my dreams but not my name. You'll follow me until the end, I am my kingdom!" It all makes sense! Can't you all read between the lines?! Subliminal messages made for perfect measure ironically.
La cagaron Cody Rroce tenia que gana ya cansa ver a el mismo campeón entienda eso
Shut up is the only champion match with help
Glad Roman won I want to see him get to a 1000 days with the title
Oh ffs WWE killed the story Usos lose their title then it should've been Roman losing his title to Cody but oh no his little "Bloodline" intervene again. Poor storylining I think
Roman should lose to an up and comer. Someone WWE views as his successor. Until then, Roman should keep the titles
This is exactly WWE i know :)) always turning heel on people :))
How appropriate I had a 💩 I had to hold during that ending.
Lol. You all got trolled in the finish. Sorry but I loved that it finished the way it did. It would've been WAY TOO PREDICTABLE for Cody to win.
People actually thought that Cody would come in and just sweep out the Bloodline like he did, having no trouble at all. He hadn’t struggled since he returned! I really thought that was odd. Really he was going to easily win the undisputed championship from Roman on his first try? Roman is so close to 1000 days! Yes WWE cares about that lol! Don’t get me wrong I thought Cody would win at some points in the match too. But you need to look for clues. It wasn’t a surprise to me that Cody lost.. he’ll win next time. Remember he’s Cody but he came from AEW. It’s not going to be that easy for him.
Cody is a way better wrestler than Roman. Facts are facts✌️
Acknowledge the goat
this is the match of the year
Roman doesn’t care about anyone but himself because he cares about being champion forever and he really really sucks 😡👎
WWE sole aim now seems to be to just piss off its fans. Ooops, I mean customers. Main events at WM used to be Rock, Austin, Hogan, Undertaker, HHH, HBK, Kurt Angle. Who are these bums now?
R.I.P WWE
Cody returned to Aew
Wwe did wrong so many times and just like a pattern they repeat....they killed a big love in me and i wont be watching RAW
Ones AGAIN wwe disappoints me smfh
Finishing moves are so pointless anymore.
Also the decision to not put over others lies on the Champion itself. In real life, Roman's ego is getting the better of him now. He is destroying so many new stars that could be the face of the company as he cant see anyone but him or his family members on top. Last time I will be visiting WWE channel ever.
Roman Reigns The G.O.A.T.🐐 of WWE
It's going to be so hard to take the Strap off Roman...
I think there is a long-term logic: tonight HHH could make an announcement to reintroduce the big gold belt for Raw via a tournament. Cody would won it, Regns would pass the 1000 days as Universal Champion. And then there would be two scenarios: Cody could lose the title by a successful cash-in of the MITB winner, then during the Royal Ruble could interfere during the match between Roman and the contender, attacking both wrestlers. Roman would retain and at Elimination Chamber there would me a match between Cody and the other wrestler to decide who would face Roman at Mania. And Cody will win the title fair and square, without interactions and inside HIAC.  The other scenario is the same story with Cody, winning the big gold, but at Mania 40 would be The Rock vs Reigns for the title. Rock would win, declaring himself the real Tribal Chief, and then next Raw would relinquish the title.
Bro this why I hat solo he just had to ruin Cody’s moment
Didnt see the point in this finish so where do Roman and Cody go now back to all same 💩 again that finish ruined the 2 nights I think
Roman should of never deserved to win that damn match. Cody Rhodes should have been the one walking away with the titles
I hope my official displeasure. Romans again champion. The WWE didn't get it right once again. Cody could have been a perfect Heel, the fans are tired of seeing Roman Reigns as Universal Champion, the fans wanted to see Cody as Champion and once again the WWE is going against the hopes of the fans! WE ARE SICK OF ROMAN REIGNS! I'm sure that Roman Reigns is the only one who has embodied the WWE and he's going to be champion for another year. Know one thing, if Romain Reigns would have wrestled in the time of BIG SHOW, MARC HENRY, BATISTA, the glory hours of ORTON, CENA, TRIPLE H, EDGE, HUNDERTAKER ... the reign of REIGNS would have lasted two weeks
WWE should of made Cody win to end the title range because Cody will have finished the story
☝️
Booooo cheating at WrestleMania!
Worse booking decision ever
La verdad lo hacen ver mal a Román con los finales de lucha si es lo mejor para los negocios lo dudo deberían de ser más creativos y lo mejor hubiera Sido que Román gane. Sin ayuda verás que Cody pedirá su revancha
Yh the story is that Roman is undefeatable but at the same time Cody winning would have brought so many more fans especially after the promos bout his dad, it’s sad man
I lost all love and respect for WWE many years ago lets say 6, And now I can sit back and relax to watch the ratings go down even more than they already are,  Also to watch the marks and neckbeards continue to worship HHH as the "Savior of WWE", Great match but a horrifically terrible ending talk about a 6 out of 10 mania  pppffffftttt clown company
Was very sad for Cody. This was his time to take the spotlight. The only way I see Roman losing his belts is by steal cage where no one else can enter. Give Cody another chance
Roman just a pushhie every fight got help lul
Only took 4 others to help him win(cheat)! Hayden, solo & usos. Cody had it won!
Can u send roman reigns vs cody rhodes wrestlemania 39 full full full match
Fightful select reported that it was a Triple H decision to have Cody lose. But everyone knows this is Vince all over. Stopping to watch WWE from now on, they are doing the same old thing again.
He can never win a match on his own
BOOOOOOO. Roman is a terrible champion, move on already.
Imagine wwe wasn't scripted and romans title reign was real everyone would have respect. But frustrating its not! I like roman but this is out of hand we all want and need something new even the commentators want something new. They probably knew exactly how things were gonna go down but there reaction still proves they want something different if not there physically reaction there tone of voice.
Well i guess if roman is going to break bruno sammartinos record there is no point in getting invested in anything wwe for a while. Looks like its time for me to check for alternative  wrestling companies to watch . Id rather relive hhh reign of terror.
WWE 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼 terrible ending
I loved watching Dusty Rhodes ❤ then both of his sons.  WWE GOT THIS ONE WRONG!  Cody.... AEW was on the road to take down the WWE (imo) Let's go back plzzzzzz
You had one job WWE, and you ruined the story.
I would like to say that I am a ling term WWE fan, but I am switching to AEW now. Vince written all over yhe decision, like what else you want to prove through Roman, he already achieved everything. But Vince being Vince cant let Dusty's son win. Last WWE show I watched. Really swithing to other shows like AEW or NJPW.
Garbage finish ruined it for me. It became Clash At The Castle 2, only worse. So it took everyone in the Bloodline, Heyman included, for Roman to beat Cody? NGL, this became stale and tiring a long time ago.  AND I'M STILL WAITING FOR MY LA KNIGHT WRESTLEMANIA MOMENT!!
Go figure.  Reigns is such a puppet. Cant earn a win honestly. Always has to have someone interfere. What a waste.
☝🏽
nice roman reigns for the win wrestlemenia 39:)
Wwe sucks man 😂😂😂,i thought this was their one chance to correct the roman reungs nonsense ,but hey 🤷‍♂️😅
I hope Cody goes back to AEW screw WWE and Vince McMahon. We all know he booked this match.
I was so disappointed that Roman could only win by cheating what a shame 🫠
The match reminded me of Triple H vs Sting. You'd think Sting coming in to WWE earned him a glorious win at WM even with interference from allies (nWo), but it goes to who's best for business.
Imagine a finish like that!?!? Lol.  They should have had Hogan come from the back and pin Reigns in an impromptu match to win the title.
NOW WHAT
Thank you WWE, i was thinking to come back and watch the home show if there would be a fighting champion but it's all send back to next year....probably....
It got ridiculous, I thought it was the right time for Roman Reigns to lose his title, if Cody can't win then who will?  Will the title remain with Roman until the end of life?!  Will he take him with him to the other world?!  It's getting ridiculous we need another champion
I’m sure he’s getting another chance at Backlash or SummerSlam
Vince is definitely back at the head of creative
Roman is boring
Roman Wins Lol
We all know Roman Reigns is the God of Wrestling
Roman Reigns is GoD
Yogyakarta Indonesia hadir
Lets goo roman still the face
Sami should be the one to dethrone Roman. Maybe at Summerslam?
So what now? Another year?
Yay
Worst Reign of terror in wrestling.
How can Roman be one of the best of all time, when he hardly ever wins without interference? Just Saying.
Ur making wwe boring just give coady
His face shows the disappointment
I can’t be the only one who thinks Roman’s title reign is getting boring right?
Get a new champion this is boring 😴
Disappointed match,Never see again roman fight will alone,look like every of his match in the future are managed with side assistance,,
Again with the usos man, honestly WWE need to take them out the equation somehow cause though I've been a Roman fan even since the Big dog days and it makes sense story wise this whole 'Usos from nowhere' nonsense has sucked the life out of several matches and I'm just done with that uce.
You could clearly see Cody pulling Reigns to the turn buckle so that Solo could easily interfere “unnoticed”💔… really thought the writers would’ve ended the streak on this one🥲
And now I go back to ONLY watching during Rumble and Mania. Everything else,I don't watch AT ALL! This was dumb.
Why does wwe keeping acting like there are no worthy superstars on the roaster? I mean, with all the talents, you’ve allowed one man hold the belts for like 3 years, making the others look like 🤡.
Terrible ending literally terrible
yes Yes yes roman Reigns retain 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Shame vkm is back in charge, maybe Cody can win mitb and cash in the garden and finish the story
COME BACK TO CARDIFF ROMAN COME BACK TO CARDIFF
ขี้โกง สุดๆ
Smh
keep crying cody fans
Y are people mad like Roman/Bloodline isn’t the greatest thing in WWE since CM Punk
Roman still reigns
Other wrestlers deserve to dethrone Reigns like Seth Rollins,  Randy Orton and not overrated Cody .Cody winning would have been injustice. All he did in Aew was bashing  WWE . Go back to stardust lol
Homelander vs aquaman 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Roman Reigns remind me of HHH reign of terror but by far worse.
Just here to leave a dislike
Cody was robbed
☝ Trow the Fingers up for the tribal chief☝
Same stupid story again and again and again.
The bloodline being unstoppable story has gotten very stale...I thought Cody coming would breathe life into it and finish it on a grand note but no WWE dropped the ball on the story and Cody's moment...
Time For the spere vs the spere
All of you might have thought that Cody should have won tonight Cody doesn't deserve it yet his time is coming
Put romancin a handicap match if one of the 2 wins they split the belts
I decided to give wwe another chance to see if maybe it was worth it. It's not. It's obvious that they have no idea what the fans wanted out of that main event  and it just proved to me why I quit watching in the first place
I have a question was was solo siko a when Kevin and Sami came in and attacked. The usos
We just hope raw aftermath wrestlemania bring good news to us..especially cody
Most over rated player of this decade. He shouldn't be holding the championship for even 1 week. WWE really sucks.
Solo proves that you don’t have to have talent, promo skills, or good ring attire that does not look like a random create-a-wrestler in a WWE game. Only nepotism by being a part of a Samoan family is good enough.
This sucked, the only place Roman will lose his titles is at WrestleMania, so this basically means he will go another year undefeated. And for such an epic match to end because of one of the bloodline intervening and cheating? At least make Roman win legit, just makes him look like a chump.
Roman still UNDISPUTED☝🏼
I'm done with WWE
Same stupid story.roman reigns win with the Usos and solo help i don't waist my time no more in that .
That was disappointing.
Cody: "gonna give the them, what they come to see"... HHH: "hold my shovel"... Me: 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️...
I'm tired of roman having the title. I like him as a wrestler but this is getting old
I really wanted Cody to win but since Reigns still retained the titles, it’s obvious that WWE is gonna have him hit the 1,000 day mark and then probably have Cody win the titles
How many more years are they going to keep this up? Unbelievable and kind of boring....  When is his AEW comeback?
Fuㄷk
It's Not Over Till Cody Gets a Rematch And Finished The Story
Roman may still be the champion but a true champion he will never be until he wins on his own and not one of his puppets does it for him. Raw will be interesting he has to deal with Jimmy and jey losing their titles.
not a wrestlemania wwe wants you to remember.    absolutely a huge disappointment.    there was only 3 great matches that was it
wow roman reigns is going to held wwe undisputed championship for 1000+ days
Lazy writing
That was the biggest triple h L
Worst match of the entire show.Cody got robbed .What a crappy ending to a great series.
Roman sucks
i heard roman say that doesnt work for me brother
Cody trash acknowledge it
Ngl I'm very disappointed with this result.. I hope WWE have plans to make this a better story and change our impression but man for now this is very disappointing
GOING BACK TO AEW.
Medio raro está pelea jajaja me a dado risa
This dude is one of the most boring champs ever
You can’t win with you lot! Cody wins and in a month people will turn on him bc you do with anyone who wins the championship, or wwe goes another route and shocks everybody and doesn’t go predictable and you lot cry about it, and would cry if Cody won for being predictable, JUST ENJOY THE PRODUCT IT WAS A GREAT MATCH
Kenny Omega vs roman at summerslam 🤣
Ah yes the classic “have him lose at Mania so we can have them rematch at Summerslam.” Except the momentum has been killed by management, by Summerslam WWE creative will backtrack and just keep the belt on Roman Reigns anyway.
Que asco, hasta cuando con el teatro de Román pfff
كسم المصارعة  طلعتوا ميتين بي رومان رينز
Roman can't win without cheating 😅
☝️🩸
Cody should have won. I'm sick and tired of the Bloodline, I'm sick and tired of Roman Reigns. He had a legendary reign, so his cousins, but even a title reign must come to an end and it should have happened at Wrestlemania. It's been 3 years FFS. 😡
Just looking at the results makes me stressed.
🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱
This is just getting boring honestly. The problem isn't so much that Roman won, it's the booking. A lot of people are getting tired to see the same Roman match again and again and again: Roman dominates at the start, the babyface starts to catch up and becomes a threat, a ref bump happens, the Usos and Solo get involved, they beat up the babyface and that's it. Done. It's just the same thing, over and over.
bobby Leshley vs roman regins
Acknowledge ur Tribal Chief!!!
waste my time. bored. we want cody to be universal champion
was such a lame match,roman sucks,cody had t it
This ending is VERY SUCKS🎉 Good job🖕
And that’s why vinnie mac needs to leave Cody should have won
Bloodline is always a loser, Cody Rhodes deserve to be new undisputed champion 🏆
☝🏾
This is just for Roman to have his 1000+ days as champion. Cody will get them titles at SummerSlam or something eventually.
This ending was the equivalent to thanos snapping in Infinity War
Am I the only one who does not think that this was a bad result? How are you people even justifying Cody winning in your heads?
I got called crazy and wrong for saying Roman was gonna win. Y’all really thought Vince was gonna let Roman get so close to 1,000 days and not hit that milestone? Only thing is I don’t like how he won, there shouldn’t have been interference if Cody was gonna lose
Roman is honestly a weak champion! He never wins on his own. Always has help. 🗑 match.
I don't watch Wrestling anymore but Cody should of won! You could feel the vibe of the stadium.
Only thing that would’ve made this this match better if it were a squash match. Roman beats Cody in 10 seconds 😂. I would’ve loved to see it
We All Knew Roman Wasn’t Losing… ☝🏾
How scripted  can they make it no one wants roman to Be champ wwe is died
Cody should have won
Just look at the bigger picture here Cody knows what the light at the end of the tunnel is this is just part of the story that we all get a chance to witness ain't no way he will not be the champion they want Roman to hit that 1000 mark so he can cemented in the history if u are a fan of wrestling or have been since forever you kno it only gets better from here from both sides
☝️
If cody lost again in round two at summerslam for championship im done with wwe
Getting tired and bored of Reigns winning everytime
So I gues Cody was the one not ready 😏
Wwe what's the point you let the usos lose but not roman
What was the reason to have Cody lose this match? Ugh so disappointing as a wrestling fan.
Was hoping for the rock to show up
cody rhodes is just riding on the popularity of roman reigns
I was watching this mania with my mom and the moment cody walked over to his family and hugged them.. We both looked at each other and in the moment we didnt say anything but i think we both knew right there Cody story wouldnt end at mania
It’s the worst feeling I felt smh 🤦🏽‍♂️ they kept the belt on Roman?! I could have got more sleep for work
WWE really dropped the ball here
💋💋💋❤❤👍👍☝☝
that’s why Vince is better than hhh
Cody did NOT deserve to win this match and WWE did justice to Reigns. You come back to WWE and you've been here just a year, and you've done literally nothing significant. Everything has been handed to Cody Rhodes on a silver platter because of WWE's nepotism. Cody Reigns is not quarter of a superstar/wrestler which Reigns is. They didn't let miles better men than Cody beat Reigns, it would have been really unfair to every other performer if someone small like Cody could defeat Reigns.
Who edited this?
Almost got me back into it WWE.  Lame duck finish.  You dropped the ball severely.
HHH did the right thing this is gonna add more fuel to the fire within the bloodline too. The Usos lost the tag team titles and Roman is gonna put the blame on Jey saying you and Jimmy failed to eliminate the Sami and Kevin problem and that's gonna start Roman to question Jey. Once they get another chance at Sami and Kevin and they lose, it's gonna start sinking in on them  saying that Roman needed them in his corner and Roman didn't have their back with Solo walking out on him too. It's the classic route of what Evolution and Legacy was saying the champion only cares about himself and not about the other people within the group. It's not over for Cody it's only just the beginning. Like I said the story within the family isn't over.
One if the greatest main events ever. The perfect energy, the perfect moment to finish this story.... but nope Roman is back to being forced over everyone like 2014-2018. All for 1000 days they ruined the perfect ending.
Reigns remain the best 👑👑👑👑
Il never watch wwe againe its heart breaking cody diserve a win
win doesn't matter, what good for bussines is going to happen. Roman just make all wwe superstar famous now, his name is going big and big, thats good for bussines.
The ending sucked
Worst ending ever solo should just go away I was Cody's time not Roman it's time for a new champion
I think both sides expected a Cody result and that was….Wow!   Match was 🔥 however
why is roman still winiing...the guy sucks...
Brutal
And that lady’s and gentlemen is how you kill a storyline. This why I feel out of love with WWE. The Rock v Stone cold fights at wrestlemaina will never beat for me, proper one on one title matches And no interfering.
Without a doubt the worst booking decision WWE has had since putting the belt on Jinder Mahal
Why do they push Roman so much. I like him but he isn't iconic like The Rock, Stone Cold or Undertaker and even they weren't pushed this hard? He can't even wrestle. If it was Seth Rollins or AJ styles I would understand.
Wierd how they continue to push roman reigns and shove him down people's throats dude hasn't lost in like 2 years we get it but dang when is it time to end it already it's annoying
Noo cody lost 😞 me waiting for Ryder wood reaction
The boss roman reigns 🎉
Roman reigns👎
Has this clown won a match by himself. Different night same ending. Reigns is losing, the three stooges come in and bail him out. It’s getting very old now
It's getting boring now!!!!!
20k dislikes and counting
Shame on you roman reigns, you can never win a match on your own without the help of your entire generation 🙄, thank your stars that Solo helped you, if not you would have shamelessly gone home without those belts, you can never win a match without rigging it, I hate you and your rubbish bloodline, you are so annoying 😒, but don't worry, the battle has just began 😒  Am so angry right now, roman reigns irritates me, I hate hearing dat name 😡
Time to boycott WWE for good. a waste of time watching boring scripts
Storyline should have ended roman should have lost the titles yet again the WWE screwed somebody this time it was Cody
if anyone understands why wwe decided to let Roman retain his title, pls explain it to me!!!!
G.o.a.t 🫶🏻
WWE killed the vibe.  This was Cody's moment to shine and they blew it . Even if Cody does eventually win those titles it won't be a feel good moment as it could have been now
Kinda called it, but to be honest I assumed it would be more about them getting people to bet on this like other events with the last minute swerve to make money on all those who put money on cody
Will someone please teach the Usos how to take a bump over the top rope? Looks like garbage every time they do it.
CM Punk is Win!
Watch he get a rematch on raw and win, so roman gets that wrestlemania paycheck
It's the USOs time to redeem back the title cause the tribal Chief is still reigning.
ROMAN ALWAYS CHEAT.  like if u agree
I'm sick of this bs, roman is past due for this title reign to end
It was a very good show
That red boots though
Remember this IS the Company which destroyed the Hell in a Cell match by ending One with a DQ 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Chief Roman Reigns 💪 congratulations
Wtf roman wins again why am i surprised this run cant last forever like roman can never win clean without one of his goons like i thought cody had it when sami and kev leveled it up but then of course roman had one more idot to come and ruin it for cody
Why Vince is Roman winning.. thats sucks we need a new champion
This is now boring... I like roman but change is needed
Well wwe now they have what they wanted, their champion of a thousand days. They don't care about what the public wanted, they just do what you as the owners of the company want.
I really thought that was the end of the bloodline
It's cheating again Roman this what you will always suck I'm getting tired of WWE allowing this
I would just like to say. Cody being hurt for that extensive time probably was a cause to him losing here. I say this because there's so much more to build here.  Not only that but it would've been dumb "imo" to have the bloodline all lose. It's good to destroy it one by one not all at once.  Now do I think Cody should win the gold eventually?? Yes but understandable to those saying it should've been here the biggest stage of them all. I believe he will win it but next year which is a long time for fans which it is.  I feel as if the storyline will only get better though with the bloodline against eachother.  The Rock doesn't need to be involved either. So let's hope that doesn't happen.  I don't watch much just the big PPVs so just sharing my thoughts.
Era momento certo para cody te ganho esse negócio é muita onda mesmo
I’m tired of having Roman reigns all ways win it’s so boring to watch because either the ISO’s or solo gets involved and it ends up not being fair
Why not cody win😢
Thank you Roman for giving Cody this unforgettable moment and main event at WrestleMania
Cody
THE GOAT❤
É uma palhaçada codi te perdido
this lil puppy roman really tough yea
Not surprised
Big L Triple H.
Also isn't it funny they didn't show the solo betrayal, what a farce. Reigns will never be beaten cos bloodline will just cheat him the titles every single time,how so very boring.
I’m glad Roman won because Cody just came back. Cody’s character is too clean and you people in here would have eventually booed him. Too soon for Cody.
I don't know how y'all feel but I was  rooting for Roman Reigns and I'm Happy
I hope that i will be alive when roman loses these titles because it becoming worrying and boring
Wwe u suck always hyping Roman.He will go down as the champion who always needed help to win. What a disgrace
This is the worst Wrestlemania main event finish of all time. Completely tone deaf to have Cody lose.
Cody struggled to beat solo sikoa I knew he wouldn’t beat the tribal chieffffff
The goat
Wether he’s a face or a heel, wwe will force Roman reigns as number one no matter how much we want literally anyone else. I thought it was a for sure thing that Cody would win when sheamus didn’t didn’t get his grand slam, because there’s no way they’d blue ball us THAT hard right? Never underestimate wwe fumbling the bag.
At end of the day they aren’t going to let AEWs former golden boy beat WWEs main draw….they never were.
It's ashame that roman can't win without cheating
So boring
thy guy❤
He cant keep getting away with this
WWE once again blow it
CHE MERDA 😠😠 DOVEVA VINCERE CODY
This has triple hhh written all over it breaking news Vince ordered Cody to win the title at raw
I'll never understand this decision. Cody deserved this. He earned this. Roman is a tired joke. Over done. Over pushed. This needs to end.
Aduh kalah yek Cody. Takpe Cuba lagi broo
Roman should’ve lost
Total bs Cody shoulda won and everybody knows it
Cry, and cry so more.. it was a good mania. I wouldn't have mind Cody winning, but if you complained about predictablility, this was the right move. Plus HHH is old school and Cody embarrassed Solo, he has to truly remove him from the equation.
I am done with WWE, maybe fans must wait another 365 years seeing part timer Reigns holding the belts! then boom he will win again and the cycle goes on!
If only this two titles can be held by Cody, this could be the best Wrestlemania ever, that’s what ruined tonight, Roman’s title did not change hands! We are bored of seeing Roman reigning again and again already! Let’s see what will happen in future Monday nights... hopefully Daddy H can get somebody out there to terminate Roman
Itll be either jey or solo to take that title off roman. Thats where my money is
Roman suck
Basically if u not shaped like Brock or Roman the big one rarely comes around
who the hell gonna stop roman thats so boring
Lame
Who is the idiot that chooses that Roman Reigns win? That’s a bad decision.
Solo needs to piss off, umaga wannabe
I’m so over this stupid tribal bs. They are just proving Roman up to get to 1000 days for some stupid reason. He’s not the greatest. In fact he’s boring.
WWE especially Vince McMahon and Triple H likes the Samoans more meaning that they will give them more attention and gold more than the entire locker room of Raw and Smackdown. I think that Roman Reigns will lose both golds on WrestleMania 40 but the question is who? 😮
I hope there will be consequences for solo , we should have a new champion,  all it's done is fuel the fire RAW is gonna be interesting
La Wwe ferais bien mieux de ce renouveler franchement c est pas mériter cody méritais amplement  ce titre. Gravement déçus par cette décision
Bs bs bs bs
I want to see Cody Rhodes become a WWE Champion. It's boring to see roman reigns holding a WWE Champion. They are more talented WWE superstars who deserve that title.
I'm not going to watch wwe anymore cause they just love their numbers and don't listen to fans
I’m so disappointed 💔 true wrestling fans no Cody and big dusty deserved it right there at wrestlemania
Gotta be fake fans and newbies watching wwe couse how dumb is yall really thinking cody will win a title in wwe they just use him couse he was from aew
This is BS... It was the perfect time for someone else who's not Roman to shine! We might be going back to Vince's Era =( What a waste!
Yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss!!!  Fantastic entertainment 👍🏾💯🔥.   👆🏾👆🏾👆🏾!
People not even at the live event should shut the f up! I was there, how do you expect us to keep on shouting with all those moments and false finishes, that is also the last match! We have been screaming since the beginning! Get a life! You can't keep us shouting again again, I lost my voice already!!!!
Cody robbed.
Terrible scripting. Should’ve give Cody the win with the bloodline slowly crumbling on the sideline
King vs emperor and the king lost
cheater won
I do Think THAT SUMMERSLAM WILL BE HIS MOMENT !! He gonna win the MITB and use it to an official match at Summerslam because I think that the legacy of his dad was maybe at Summerslam and Not Mania  (Also Roman and the bloodline deserved a 1000 DAYS OF REIGN)
One of those entertaining antics, it's unfair to Cody and some of the other wrestlers, just paid to be the background for others
☝🏼
Always cheat because they are shemale fighter
Absolute joke
it annoys me how much cody deserved that. I like romans character but he’s held it for too long even if he hasn’t reached the 1000 days he needed cody to finish his story
Some people aren't quite getting why some people are mad. It's not that Cody lost, it's that Roman won. The fact is that at this time him having the title isn't helping or building up anyone. Also its the same thing everytime. Roman comes in, looks dominant for the first half of the match, starts to see that his opponent is greater than he thought, and he may have underestimated them, and then someone comes in and takes out Roman's opponent for him. It has happened in every defense at this point. That is not good story telling. And that is the issue with the Uso's having their titles as well. KO and Sami NEEDED to win Saturday night, at the very least for the health of the titles. The days where 800, 900, 1,000 day reigns (pun intended) are long gone, as they were a product of the territory era. At this point, the best thing they can do is this: Roman starts to gloat about how he won, and how he still values his cousins, even though they couldn't get the job done. Adam Pierce arrives and says "Roman, this is ridicules at this point. They may have lost, but at least they did it on their own. Your next defense will have a special stipulation. There will be multiple refs, and while your opponent will still need to beat you via pin or submission, if you win by count out or DQ, you will be stripped of the titles." The next match comes, it starts to go through the same formula. Dominant Roman, starts to realize he underestimated his foe, etc. Paul Hayman and Solo try to distract the refs, but one isn't having any of it. The Uso's run out, thinking they are clear and super kicking Roman's opponent. Bell rings, the other ref saw it all.  Roman is LIVID. He blames Jimmy and Jey. He tells them they need to win back their titles. They don't. Roman starts to become paranoid. Its Sammy all over again. They are trying to sabotage him. He orders Solo to take care of it. Solo refuses. They are his brothers. Roman snaps. Jimmy, Jey, and Solo abandon him. Paul Haymen continues to whisper in Roman's ear. They betrayed him. They need to be taught not to go against their tribal chief. He starts taking them out one by one. Its not attacks, not to him, its punishment. They sabotaged him, they failed him. He is the tribal chief. He is unraveling. Rakishi tries to talk to him. "Roman, this isn't you. Roman you need to stop" Roman agrees. He needs to stop. He needs to stop letting the tribe betray him. He takes out Rikishi. Roman appears in front of the crowd. He is the tribal chief, and they will acknowledge him, after all the family already has in the past. He has forced everyone in the family to acknowledge him. He is the tribal chief. There is no one in the family that is better, that has more power than him. Then it happens, it finally happens. "IF YA SMELL!!!" Rock comes out. He has been watching. He has been busy and has not been able to deal with the situation. Three years he let it get out of hand, but enough is enough. Rock looks Roman in the eye and says the one thing Roman has not heard anyone say yet. "I do not acknowledge you." Roman smirks his cocky smirk, and him and the Rock laugh, and then Roman goes for a shot at the Rock, only to get a Rock bottom. Its set, Roman vs. Rock. And Roman... looses. This gets the title on someone else and allows for the buildup of someone else, finally gives us the Roman v. Rock match they have been dangling for YEARS. And it gives Roman a fresh start, from here he can go on to be an unhinged heel, in total denial of what happened, or it lets him start to see the error of his ways and start to become a face again. But also what it does is that if Roman DOES want time away, it gives him an out to do so.
Cody didn’t deserve to win to Roman. He needs a lot more work to do. Give him a year or two. Roman is on Brocks level and Cody isn’t even on Daniel Bryans level. Let alone Kofi Kingston.
WORST SCRIPT EVER
Roman is pathetic and can’t win a match on his own. Cody had it won
Any money says roman goes 1000days as champ
ROMAN THE LOOSER AND CHEATER
its because of Solo and his jacket again LOL!!! damn that jacket collection of his!
I'm sad that Cody lost but we have to acknowledge Roman Reigns ☝️
I knew it wasn't his time. WWE did very well with this match . I'm a Sami fan . We need a storyline, that would be redemption for Cody and the Rhodes family. His reign would be short if it has happened today. I got respect for Rhodes .
It honestly broke my heart, now I guess they want Roman’s reign to last forever
I know all these points,but why is there no la knight in la
All this build up for nothing. What was the point of the story of Cody Rhodes winning the Royal Rumble if he wasn't gonna win the WWE Title? Also, isn't it high time we get a new champion for once? Either split the belts, or have it finally change hands, we get it, WWE loves Roman "the Tribal Chief" Reigns, yes we have the best story in years in The Bloodline vs Sami Zayn, but man, the title reign itself, has gotten really stale.  Edit: on the bright side, Cody Rhodes can say that he main evented Wrestlemania.
Good. Can't imagine clown Stardust wins the titles. Come on guys, Cody is old...You complain the titles should be to someone younger. We got Theory for that
They going to give it to him at summerslam they want roman to break Bruno record
WWE done dirty to Cody man😢
I knew they weren’t going to let Roman lose before the 1000 day mark & it makes perfect sense to me, plus the hype will be bigger and the pop will be louder when Cody finally wins at summer slam, this whole process felt kinda rushed to me even tho Cody’s been back in the wwe for over a year he’s only been in the ring for 3/4 months out of the year he still hasn’t put in enough work in his return to just beat Roman
🥱
Cheater wins
If roman just won by himself for once I would accept It, but come on man, everyone wanted Cody to get the w, such bs  from behind the curtain fr
Everything was so perfect, until Cody didn’t win
If roman really strong why he need solo and usos every match
From show to show the same match, with the same plot, only the opponents change
C es Gunther qui mettra fin au règne de roman. C es prévisible car la wwe le hype a fond.
LETS GO CODY LOSTTTTT😂😂😂😂🎉🎉😂🎉😂🎉🎉😂
"legitimed champion"
Wrong result
Adrenaline in my soul Shouldn't have smashed that stupid throne
I wonder if roman is sucking triple H off each week to keep the titles its so boring now... Cody should be champ, end of
This is why wwe won't go to that next level because stuff like this 😒

Biggest mistake ever. Cody deserved this. Nothing matters now. Another year to mania. Putting the belt on him at Raw or another PPV has lost all meaning.
Why even have a main event match if you're going to get interferences.
I think Roman gonna blame Usos for losing title which will lead the disband of the bloodline. THEN cody will win somehow
The match was amazing, but when Roman took the mic, for a moment I taught he will tell us to let professionals handle our taxes.
@WWE I am no longer watching any of your PPV. The whole WWE Universe Fans needed to see Cody Rhodes Winning at WrestleMania 39. Roman Reigns would have not survived that match, if The Bloodline did not interfere every Main Event. @WWE Roman Reigns is not capable of Winning a Match and that proves to everyone that he does not deserve to be your Champion
Why Cody he didn't take the titles that makes him down for how many years of hard worrk if he find himself in aew why this happen to him in WWE maybe McMahon doesn't like the guy
Roman 😢😢😢😢 Don't do this to us 😢
I'm so glad he lost! He's so overrated! He's not ready; if anything they dropped the ball with Sami Zayn winning
Dang it for once I have to say you dropped the ball       Romans 1,000 days was not more important than Cody's one time.   Now I hope he's the next champion if you want a chance at aew stars this was not the way to do it.
Roman has to cheat to win like always. Lost respect for him and his family. By cheating he is putting a bad taste in the Samoa culture and family.
What a terrible ending
I am tired of Roman Reigns holding those titles hostage it's like dealing with Brock Lesnar again Cody Rhodes should have won the big one why we allowing this to happen this story with Roman Reigns is getting old and stale I only watch the event see him lose
The bigest upset ever yet the best Wrestlemania in the last 10 years
wwe it was time for cody why roman wins
Roman is nothing without his 3 dogs😂😂😂😂😂
Ronan can’t win without help of others 😮
I’m beginning to grow old on this tribal chief bs…🤦🏾…starting to feel as if Roman reigns is being over hyped…
Roman Reigns is the greatest champion of the last 10 years. The way he generate heat and frustration to fans.
I'm pleased Cody didn't win, purely because it meant it wasnt predictable. You can have Cody go and have a little crisis of confidence and build the story of The Bloodline falling apart. By Summerslam, Cody can earn another shot. This time, Roman has no help, Jimmy and Jey can show up but ultimately turn on and cost Roman one of if not both titles.  This will allow the pair a longer period to tell a story, rather than Cody feeling somewhat forced into the title picture after 9 months on the sideline. Sure, he won the Rumble... From number 30, it's like winning it on easy mode.  Plus 1000 day Undisputed Universal championship reign? In the words of the late great Dusty Rhodes, "That's money baby!"
What an unexpected end 😂
No moment is bigger than Mania. This was the best time to get the belts off Roman. It felt like the perfect moment. Some people say it would be “predictable.” Okay, and? Predictable doesn’t mean bad! The feeling and seeing Cody win would have been 100x better than what happened. There’s no one left to beat Roman now. No one credible enough, no one he hasn’t beaten before, no one you can believe in tbh.
This is  nothing new.. this is WWE BS 101.. put it up with it for decades. Still very happy that I haven't watched an episode of that dreck in 5 years...
Cody deserved it
WWE WrestleMania 39 (Sunday) results: Roman Reigns retains Undisputed Universal Title with the help of Solo Sikoa - Wrestling News ( Very wrong cheat should remove help Solo Sikoa stop it no no help remove only game only Roman R. VS Cody R. Please rule very serious about must support report Solo Sikoa and too another 2 team help no way cheat very wrong hope will again due game only 2 player game soon hope WINNING FOR CODY R.)🙏🤟👏🤞🏻
Vince screwed Cody
Cody was failed by the WWE. What, are we suppose to wait till Summerslam????
Cody 🥺
What y'all thought hahaha 🩸☝🏾🩸☝🏾🩸 understand us now !!!!!
*** you WWE worst Wrestlemenia ever worst decision shame on them I thought tripleH will do something special but it’s more like a bad decision like vince
Wresltemania 69 Main Event will still be Roman Reigns with his 50 year title reign on the line
Terrible, call me when Roman is gone.
All of the sudden everybody is a WWE writer….. SHOUT OUT TRIBAL CHEIF ☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️
You just don’t get it Roman had to reach 1000 days of reigning if he would have lost guess what he would have not accomplish that especially since he is close Cody just wanted to make his father proud did he care about the titles that much and then we still need the dream match Roman Rings Vs The Rock for the Undesputed Titles if this gets 1k likes your life will be blessed for the rest of your life. 🙏
It's means royal rumble winner from 2021,2022,2023 never win over Roman reigns 😅😂😂😂😂
Better people quit wwe all drama
Really Romen wins again by cheating, I'm done with the WWE......
Pretty disappointed, but there's still a lot of potential for the Bloodline's fall, like they can have Roman be mad at the Usos for losing the tag team championships and kickstart the resentment between them before they eventual fight each other or somewhere along those lines  Still, really bummed out Cody lost
Punde, mayiru, kottai, sunni Roman. Poi suttu okku Roman
It’s gone on abit this has  surely history with Cody is a lot bigger than Romans anyone who has ever followed wrestling will no that I think it’s pretty sad how rains wins with out a fair fight every time there is no wonder so many ppl leave wwe there really isn’t
Of course, they had to cheat to win like the losers they are
Hopefully that's the end of cody
I was disappointed😭
Great match. Best in a long, long time.  HHH is killing it.
WWE played the ultimate mind game 😂by making people think that Roman was going to lose (wouldn’t have been mad if he did)  but in the end wwe left everyone shocked 😂at least the people who weren’t expecting him to win 😂
There’s an old sane from Beyblade metal Fusion that I remember clearly “if you loose just stand up again no matter how many times you loose grit your teeth and stand back up again wrestlers who stand back up again become strong” Cody will be stronger then ever trust me don’t count out Hunter yet the man has a deep bag of tricks
What game is this won by cody rhodes..
Lol ufc is better
a champion who always wins because of cheating.
How momentus would it have been to have cody back, win the rumble and dethrone roman! But no, they killed it entirely with roman retaining. Annoying. Wanted to see Jey turn too.. any way i do believe cody will eventually win the big one!
I knew that Roman was gonna win from the get go, wwe is so lame nowadays
Don't worry guys, it's the WWE way to build stories. Cody will come back and will win the belt in some epic moment later. It was already like that when I was watching 15 years ago.
That's the stupidest decision WWE made. Everybody is tired of the bloodline
The fans today wouldn't be able to stand Bruno Sammartino as champion. They want a title change at least once a year like it's a trophy given to whoever they like at the moment.
Ain’t gonna lie Cody a real one tho for bringing lil Brodie lee forbidden door don’t exist anymore because of Cody I can say that much
Let’s get this trending
The match was awful and Cody got screwed but everyone expected that to happen I give it a 1 out of 10 try harder WWE cmon
The main event was....alright but alright.😔. Sick of Roman always winning.
Cody don't let Roman escape on another oportunity
Roman is truly lozer
Cheaters of the century Roman can’t win a single match without seeking help of his brother no matter who the superstar is against 😂
ده شئ سئ جدا لماذا wweيحتفظ بلقلب كل هذا الوقت سيناريو وحوار ليس جيد
The tribal chief ☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Since betting on these matches is now a thing......alot of money stayed with the bookies last night.
Roman should leave WWE for a break. Then se should have a 6 men match for the Universal Championship ( Cody vs boby Lashley vs Brock Lesnar vs Omos vs stroman vs anyone )  Then at SummerSlam roman will be back
WWE KILLED YOUR MOMENT CODY IT WILL NEVER BE THE SAME EVEN IF YOU DO EVENTUALLY WIN IT...SAD SMH
WWE suck they need to sell the company
Roads doesn't deserve to be there he looks like a fool
All fans need to understand they are going for the streak just bare with them 😂😅😂😅
Roman can never win on his own 🙂 always need help
Cody's gonna win later on as Roman needs to surpass 1000 days as champion.
Ok, now Jey has to be the one to dethrone Roman.
☝️
Should have never left AEW for WWE bs they gonna have roman as champion until he retires
I was there live! What an experience 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This would've worked if he lost let's say at the PPV right before Wrestlemania then won at Wrestlemania. WWE just told every single person in the world he's not good enough to win the title at Wrestlemania.
The Thumbpoke Of Doom.
Wwe is boring, I hate wwe sucker's
Roman is to much weak this time
Actually Roman reign is disqualified his title because the usos hitting Cody rhodes
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
Low life Roman Reigns and his low life family
After that main event, two feelings simultaneously brushed over me. Heartbreak and Anger! I'm so f*cking disappointed. :(
Cody Rhodes??? Are you guys kidding me??? How ANY of y'all thought Cody Rhodes could beat The Tribal Chief is beyond me... I personally dont think he even deserved the chance... he should be happy he was even able to have the chance to be beaten by Roman Reigns... i much MUCH rather would have rather seen The Rock come back to teach his Nephew who the REAL Tribal Chief is... jfs 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
This match had all the makings to be one of the great baby face wins. Watching it reminded me of foley vs rock and Austin vs HBK. I hope Cody can get his moment one day. He deserves it.
Kevin, Sami and Cody should be group
All the bloodline haters have to form a faction
Randy Orton must be the one who will defeat Roman Reigns!!  🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍
WWE sucks They should give pple what they want  It's bad
This that B.S. once again!
hehe not suprice ，day 1 all win champion ，day 2 all retain ~ boring like this
Wwe management please provide affair ground you always favor Roman reigns alot, we know Cody Rodds is better ❤
Another let down from wwe...
Ever watched game of thrones finale ? Yeah The same feeling I got from this match ending ..
No one like this
The C*** Roman cant do anything on his own. Should be stripped of the titles. Disgraceful that he is revelling so. He would be nothing if it wasn't for outside interference. Acknowledge the C***.
Its always roman reigns with the bloodline he always need them to help i say he is scared
Well I am done with WWE. Missed opportunity by WWE. Fail big time in my opinion; having Roman win makes no sense. WWE you have disappointed me for the last time.
The ending reminded me why I stopped watching WWE
💪💪💪💪💪
The WWE failed again. The WWE isn't worth watching. The days of great stories and wrestlers are gone. I wasn't surprised to read that roman kept the titles hostage still. He has been cheating since day one.
Starting to lose interest now since Cody Rhodes lost.  The title run for Roman has been amazing.  But it’s time for a change
☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻
I used to fake sleeping and sneek out of my room to watch WWF/WWE around 1998, those were the times. Been years since I watched a full episode, watch highlights just for nostalgia, but even the highlights seem too long nowadays.  When Cody returned, it somehow caught my attention, the buildup to this moment was awesome, but in the end they still failed me, again.  I watched this skipping 10secs fw just to go through is fast and check the outcome first, maybe I knew..🥴
Nakakasawa na si roman reigns dapat si cody naman champion😥
WWE is going down hill. Same stuff with Roman.  He fight and his people interfere. This is getting boring. The refree gets knock out or is distracted. It worked in the 90's but not now.
I now see why there's AEW, I now see why everyone is leaving WWE. I thought Triple H was going to be different than Vince and give others a chance to be at the top, but I guess not. He's just like Vince
Initially I was disappointed Cody didn't win but I get it now
How I wish we could riot🔥🔥🔥🔥
so Triple H sucks at booking like the old Vince. What the hell were they thinking? WWE sucks
Where was the referee in all that chaos.
I quit wrestling from now on😥
CODY  go back to  aew
Dang, this match was a burn (bad move) They should have dropped the title to Cody. Match was insane and great show until it wasn't
My only real question is who's next? Cause there's no one left ☝️
Get those Belts off of Roman this is all Favoritism  anymore. And Interference.
Actually glad roman got the win. Cody winning was too predictable. He can come again
Rhodes should have won
HHH Vince your both idiots keeping Roman has champion hoping the Rock will accept the match vs Roman. Should have given it to Cody.
WWE writers suck! must be paid off to let Roman Reigns cheat by having help.
why USO lose but Roman won
family helper 😂😂
Perfect time to dethrone roman, yet they screwed it up, classic wwe, gj building someone up to bear roman now
at 1:45 isnt that -1 in AEW?
Garbage
CM Punk is win again.
So glad they kept the titles on Roman. Can't just come back to the wwe and get those titles lool gotta work for it. He was handed that number 30 royal rumble entry. Gotta love the ending
Maldita seas WWE no vuelvo a ver una lucha por eso Cody se fue y ahora mira
Well I was at the match and I was pisssed
Without the help of the Usos Roman Reigns for sure will loss his match against Cody Rhodes. Hope their next match will be with disqualification who ever sides will interefere will loss the match for a fair championship fight👍👍👍
Roman is a loser. Usos need to help him to retain the belts
I like  aew more than  wwe
WWE is a joke. This is ridiculous
that Cody is the one who is going to lower him from that throne
Roman make WWE a billion dollars per year and has done so for the last three in a row and he also made this rivalry possible too so do you guys think the guy who is being looked at as the Jordan of wwe will loose so fast after making wwe another billion this year ? Lol you guys must very irrational, RR calls all the shots and will still do so until he holds the belt for 2k days in a row to solidify himself as the untouchable in dub dub history. This is a business and the golden goose will be protected at alll I mean alllllll cost
Romen sucks... For real
They better have something planned for the next story line cause I’m pissed
I really wanted Cody to win although he didn't but he is still my number 1 favorite and to roman I know he will lose eventually
I NOW  don't like  wwe 😒
Out of all of the Rhodes my favorite is still lana Rhodes
Cody not champ material at Wrestlemania.. He is somewhat like ziggler level.. He can take the title but not for long and at diff pay per view
Cody the Best.  Roman Solo No  jantle mand
Tbh it was pretty clear from the beginning that cody wouldn’t win bc of the same tactics the WWE uses. They made him seem invincible before mania only to have him lose 😢
Cody merecía ganar
Thank you Cody 👏👏👏 Thank you Cody 👏👏👏 Thank you Cody 👏👏👏
I'm so happy that Roman Reigns retained his titles ❤😍☝🏼☝🏼
Best for business keeping the title on him!!!
Ah ffs why did Roman have to win it's cody time now
Paul’s movement after Roman said “Acknowledge me” is funny 😁 😂😂😂
Garbage finish.
Hoy perdió el wrestling 😢
Brock Lesnar rematch for roman rung Brock Lesnar in the beast the conqueror🙏
😢😢😢 Cody
What wrong with you WWE?! Cody should win this match what a nonsense
Please WWE it’s getting so boring now just change the e champion, idec who it is any more
H.H.H = VINCE
Yeah I'm getting sick and tired of Roman reigns w in we all know it's fake why couldn't they just let Cody Rhodes win
Cody will never win after this, its over. Fans will tire over this after a week. They should have just pulled the trigger
Da intense look of Solo to cody is so intense😂😂
Roman and Bianca need to eventually drop these titles.
Roman reigns is always winning in a dirty game  be equal bro afraid to lose the everything to her
Nothing like a champion who wrestles twice a month.
Cody we feel sad for you man ❤
CAGE MATCH next .. dogs not allowed❌️
Wwe screwed it up AGAIN! We shouldn't be surprised
As nice as it would've been for Cody to win it all, I think they want to build it up a little more. You can't topple an empire overnight so to speak, and the bloodline took an L in the Usos, a storyline that had been built up already. Sami and KO got their payoff and I think Cody will get his in due time if he is indeed the one to take it
Mark my Words: Summerslam will be the night he looses his titles
"The idiom "jumping the shark" is pejorative and is used to argue that a creative work or outlet appears to be making a stunt in a seemingly exhaustive attempt to generate elevated attention or publicity to something that was once perceived as popular, but is no longer."
Roman is a joke , he can't win on his , he always need help to win. So sad
most of the crowd was silent at the end    you could even see fans flipping off roman reigns   thats how much people are tired of the bloodline
W,W,E had such a good story that made me start looking at W,W,E again after not looking at W,W,E for years and then they go and screw it up right at the end. That me gone not going to waist my time looking at W,W,E anymore they had me back as a Fan but now have lost me.
Roman is going to lose them tonight on Raw. You wait
Roman reigns will always be a coward without his bunch of stupid cousins, he is NOTHING. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. HE IS A DEFINITION OF USELESSSSSSSSSS
Honestly that ending was trash. There shouldn’t be an interference during a match of this magnitude.
Unsubscribe
Terrible booking and terrible way to ruin a great main event. Now, Roman has no competition. WWE had a great story with Cody Rhodes and what did they do with it? They f**ked it up.
Literal goosebumps right now
WWE  I DON'T LIKE IT ANYMORE WWE RUNDE IT
At my place I was the only one rooting for cody 😢😢😔
Vinces hand. He hated dusty, made him a mid card jobber. Pulled the rug from his son as well. If you ain't vinces boy you ain't vinces boy. Don't care if tri is in charge, he's married to a mcmahon carnie.
I understand the disappointment but i think it’s better for Roman to actually still reach the 1000 Days mark as Champion because firstly there wont be a Champ holding this title that long again for a long Time and secondly it gives the person who beats Roman for the title after 1000 days a major boost of momentum
I'd like one of the usos to do so
No this is on sale you know who is the search for Kuyi wolves title do you go for incision 😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡🤬🤬
Wwe conseguiu fazer um trem feio,Roman campeão é meu ovo
I miss cena being the face of the company
could have had a champion that showed up at most shows and all ppvs but no u had to go with boring bloodline story.  roman cant win without help either lol  probably wont see him defending or showing up for a month or 2
Román only wins with the Usos, or Solo, or both.
The right result
He still won after that trouble😢🎉🎉
Endeavor wants Roman as champ  Sad how you "fans" don't pay attention
Same story line, Roman Reigns the most coward lack of talent Champion forever. The amount of fight that he has win on his own can be counted with one hand. Is a shame that's their best story line. Writers should be ashamed for such a garbage.
Your fail then build back up story telling sucks and unfortunately for Cody we won't be watching when he eventually wins and it's not because he's not the guy it's because your writers aren't the guys
what am i goona wait another year for roman to maybe lose his title
I actually like the direction they’re taking here. With a faction so dominant over the past 2.5 years it wouldn’t make sense for them to lose everything in 1 event. Just like the Roman Empire of old, Roman’s Empire will slowly crumble. He is going to punish Jimmy and Jey. This will make Jey finally ditch the Bloodline. Jimmy will eventually join him. Solo will be torn between Roman and his brothers and by the time Summerslam rolls around Roman will be all by himself, forced to defend the titles alone. Cody will feud with someone else (probably a returning Randy) to rebuild himself to meet Roman once again, at Summerslam. Cody will win and go on to successfully defend at WM40 to get his Mania Moment.
Roman must get his 1000 days before you can think about the Tribal Cheif taking a L.
Someday at Backlash, Cody will get them.
Nobody is talking about the "Helluva Kick and the stunner" that Roman kicked out. After multiple "Cross Rhodes" delivered my Cody, Reigns was still able to deliver a Spear for the win without wasting time. The power and strength of Reigns are something u should be talking about. Give that man a 👍 👍
Amazing match amazingly built up like brock vs Roman except the ending match was a let down but not this time also don’t worry Cody will get the titles soon gotta wait til Roman hits 1k first
Cody could of never come back in wwe beat sethnand roman and remain undefeated and a champ. I been telling people how delusional they are
Lmao look at refs face @5:41 😂 WWE will never not be entertaining. I haven’t watched it since a kid but I like these new characters. Cool stuff. Jeff Hardy is a legend though!
The Roman Empire still Reigns. Indeed, the Bloodline rocks 🔥🔥🔥
WWE doesn't like to send the audience home happy lol. I just don't know who Roman's gonna lose to at this point. It almost has to be MITB or a triple threat or something.
Roman Reigns needs the title to be on top, this is why WWE are scared to let him drop it, atleast when Cena was on top other guys like Orton, Edge etc also had multiple turns in beating him for the title, Reigns is made to be unbeatable because without the title would he be the same draw as Cena was without the title? No chance! It's all business, Cody was screwed because of it
Cody's baby already knows how to play for the cameras!
Damn Fake WWE .. this is too much .. never been like that before.
Im tired of roman he sucks now he dont deserves to be champion
HOW BRO HOWWWW
Imagine the if cody would won  The crowd was insane that match  But didn't  Another time for once month appears guy
ROMANS he couldn't win alone, always need an assistant
i will come back to this page everyday till someone tells me who can beat roman at this point
As a wrestling fan of 30 years, I have never been more done with WWE. No more straws. I'm out
Roman wins = stop watching WWE. That's so easy
I think Roman its not brothers to help him this cody is not lost🔥
Idk if I want to watch wwe anymore after that. I also wouldn’t mind seth, randy, or  Gunther beating Roman
Always the same with this guy..ref gets knocked out, usos interfere, 2 more come outta nowhere to fight the usos, reigns hits the spear and covers, ref recovers and counts the 3.
People paid good money just to see Cody win.
im so tired what a waste why even have cody win the rumble and main event
Cody should have won and so does Asuka!
Vince is back to push the hell out of roman shames
Acknowledge your tribal chief
Stupid ending that ruined an otherwise great Wrestlemania.
It was to soon for Coddy to win there was no real story that's why Coddy lost...if it was Sami in that position better cause it took 9 months in the making....
My Gee Never Gives Up Big Dog
The wrong call was made
People thought Cody would win 😂😂😂😂 my guy The Tribal Chief reigns supreme once more ☝️
You know a story is good when it makes you so emotionally attached to it. Even though the ending sucked, but the story continues, and it will have an ending, when Cody finally captures The titles.
Interference in a championship match at mania? Even when HHH was running evolution, they didn't run in to bail him out when he lost to a certain someone.
worst decision like i understand romans storyline but needed to change
who is gonna beat roman now what am i gonna have to wait till triple h gets kenny omega even then roman probably still beat him cause why not at this point romans probably gonna beat brunos record at this point
damn i can't believe cody loose, personaly i got enough of reigns's reign...
I saw this coming😹
شوبببببب شوببببب و يلا على اللوبي ولك
The era of stuffy matches continues... All of people so tired of that... And it's terribly insulting... First Solo, then Uso, then Reigns was to follow.... To break the all in this way at the end and, as a result, leave everyone at the broken trough... Bravo... the worst outcome with false hope...
Absolutely pathetic I remember why I quit watching wwe why keep pushing Roman for 3 years good God he doesn't even need the belt for all the little kids who are his fan to keep purchasing product I hope the ratings plummet in the weeks to come so they can see the mistake they made
Looking like homelander
bottom line is was Codys time and WWE messed that up
WWE fans are never happy. Always complain lol
Roman has been hyped too much. It is time for someone to end his reign
What a disgrace WWE made this match end like this.
Bra im 35 from Jackson Mississippi and im a Gangster. The undertaker vs Michaels wm25 was the best match of the area. Undertaker loosing to Brock was the most saddest thing to me. Bra I cried 😭 with Cody WTH! Roman reigns had this moment time after time. I cut the ppv off 📴 phone on DND 🖕🤨😭
Not only cody but wwe also put asuka lose for wrestlemania 2. This is damn f**k!
Roman in the end cannot survive on his own this should of been Cody time.
Not yet his not ready .I'm going to be honest Roman sucks to me but I already know ahead of time he wasn't going to win.
that ending totally shows Vince is still in charge only he would completely swerve the fans and screw cody like that  again they dropped the ball
Roman. Then. Now.  and Forever. Acknowledge the Tribal CHIEF!
I think they are going to get roman titles, rain to 1000 days of holding it then he loses to Cody or someone else but who roman reigns haven't beat who's going to stop him
Time for a new champ now. Its getting boring. Every match is soooooo predictable. Usos get involved & help him win every time. Bring back the good old days when the champ would be on raw & smackdown every week & defend the title at EVERY ppv.
Pointless Cody winning the rumble and everything for Roman just to retain its boring reigns as champ so that’s me done with wwe for a while now
This man is most boring ever in WWE history.
Garbage ending lol tell me Vince is back without telling me Vince is back
What people need to realise the usos lost theirs. So it’s gunna be a good story coming. Stop crying
One thing people don’t understand about Roman Reigns is that  You can have skills to beat him but you can’t endure as he can  The guy can survive for as many minutes as he want  You can only win him if your can match his enduring strength and stamina
The goat Roman🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
One thing people don’t understand about Roman Reigns is that  You can have skills to beat him but you can’t endure as he can  The guy can survive for as many minutes as he want  You can only win him if your can match his enduring strength and stamina
I think Roman winning leads to something happening within the bloodline maybe Roman getting pissed at Jay for getting pinned and causes drama and Jay causes him to lose the title at summerslam…I really hope that happens cuz WWE has a lot of pissed of fans right now
I been waiting untill it all crash with roman winning
So good and deserved he lost
Sorry  cody fans...but was hoping  vimce was gone say not today pal..
Wtf wwe wtaf i am so dissapointed still sucking roman off so hard cody needs to win he desserves the championships i cant beleive you have done this i think i am official finished with wwe
ماحدا بيحسن للزعيم
Can't win a clean match.  The crowd should chant TRIBAL CHEAT
it's sad that they keep one guy champion that long give it a break need a change , most of the time its interference anyways just to to keep him champ
So many people are hating on this decision but it's the right choice. Cody wasn't ready yet his journey so far was too easy. Cody winning was too predictable.
it hurts really deep down inside cody didn't win and as a community if they voted majority of fans wanted cody to win forget the story it's cody's time to have an up for once
We all said we’d be happy either way but we were lying. That was the most underwhelming ending ever.   In this year of wrestling alone WWE has screwed the three biggest new stars they could’ve made who had a genuine chance to beat Roman. First there was Drew with a U.K. crowd, then there was the Sami moment, and now Cody not finishing the story.   The issue now is that no one should beat Roman or they’re going to waste it on someone who didn’t deserve it   Even if they finish the Sami story, they should’ve pulled the trigger this mania because I feel like his moment at the top is gone too
Roman can't win on his own he cheats all the time
*everyone hates Roman* *Sufferin succotash*  *Everyone hates Roman more* *Roman leukemia propaganda surfaces* *Everyone feels bad for Roman and no longer boos* *Roman returns to the push of terror* *People remember that they hate Roman*
Well I'm done with wwe now
I told everyone that they were going to keep the titles on Roman but they didn't believe me.
Yes!!!!
WWE just spat on wrestling fans, and the whole Rhodes family legacy. Very L
Just another weak script. As usual head of the weak table needs help with every match very very weak thumbs down .
Cody Rhodes My Man ... Don't Worry Brother sure you will win the championship belts soon it's your time and moment ❤❤❤❤❤love from Malaysia
Summerslam
I was wrong about any particular swerve preventing Rhodes from winning, but he still lost I theorized he would.  Still an absolutely great match, the near falls and multiple finishers and run ins all worked.  If Rhodes had to lose, though, I'd have rather seen a more shocking return/debut than it just being Solo back at ringside.
Eso no sirve ese tipo es un campeón de cartón si la ayuda de sus primos no hubiese ganado
you are so the best and Fantastic roman reigns ☝👊☝💞👑💞
Cody needed more adversity he wasn't ready.
Roman is a big cheat!!!
I hate Roman. He’s been champ too long.
Its a cheating by roman you should rematch
Keep fighting Cody. You may have lost the fight but the war is not over yet.
Lots of skipping
Day 1 match was a great match Day 2 wwe undisputed universal championship   decline in prestige
I saw this match live . WWE just wants roman reing to get 1000 days.. This was so unfair , cody deserved it
Cheeeeehooo!🇼🇸
Im guessing Roman will lose at SummerSlam in Detroit, this August.  I dont think he will lose at Money In The Bank in London, this July, mainly because the audience here in London wouldn't be big enough to see Roman lose. It's not worth it for WWE to make Roman lose here in London. SummerSlam would be a suitable event for Roman to lose. Its also a good place for Mr MITB to cash in.
BIG dog Come Back
I'm so glad Roman won. He is the guy, he's a mega star, got the presence, the look, everything. He's been the champion for ages but still the fans are still invested. Not like the forced 1 year John Cena or JBL title reigns.  Sorry to Cody fans but all he is is a guy in a suit talking about how great his dad was. He needs to walk his own path. This loss will be good for him, he was in the spotlight but nowhere near Romans level. I don't think anyone is to be honest. He can build on this and go for the title again when he's more rounded.
Seriously WWE We all like Roman Reigns but come it was time for the Reing to end I believe I speak for us all it was Cody's moment
Cody is so good this match this is one if his best match ever he deserve to win.
Great match. Dusty would have been proud.
If Brock Lesnar suddenly appears after Roman wins the match it will be another epic moment .
The way Brandi was vibing to Cody's music was wholesome
This is pathetic it was Cody’s time and yet again wwe screwed the fans out of what they wanted, as expected
What a waste of a great story…
Wastemania
Well, I guess this removes all doubt that Vince is back in control of creative. What in the hell is the end game here? They had a perfect moment built here and decided to throw it away. It doesn't matter if Cody wins the title later. This was the time to do it. It doesn't even matter who Roman loses it to now, or how long he holds it. This was their chance to make a star, and they blew it again just to Swerve people
Roman cant win alone he needs back up coward
You try code
Roman the greys kicking in
Wwe's creative: everyone expect cody to win so we will have him lose, because eVeryTHinG cAn hAPpEn In wWe. The story was perfect, now it ended in a wet fart, because even if Cody will win it eventually, it wont have nowhere near the same impact, by having roman to win, they made cody one of the boys, they took a lot of the heat of the feud away, and it does not really give anything more to roman either. It was just the perfect moment to switch the belt because of the story and everything involved, it made go back and watch wwe a lil bit, at the end im saying: why do i bother with those people... They want to milk the cow, but now the milk will start to turn...
Glad Romain won he deserved it
So boring! Time for a change!
This was pathetic and disappointing, they could have at least made him win clean, but he sadly can't win a match without help, and even saying that, they did cody dirty, dude deserved the win
Man, so disappointed Cody did not win. Hopefully they do him justice next year
Randy is gonna come out to hold Cody’s head up high on raw, he better.
They basically did the same thing to cody they did to luger when he went up yoko at summerslam in 1993
Roman needed help to win A match No Surprise There
Didn’t even have to watch to know who is going to win
WWE just screwed Cody Rhodes. Enough said.
The older Cody Rhodes gets the more he looks like his father
First it was Drew's moment at Clash at the Castle. Now it was Cody's moment at Wrestlemania that was not given 😢. I feel bad for Cody not winning. He deserved it man.
The Powers that be realized that Cody CANNOT carry the company on his back like a WWE Champ has to. Plus I agree with Seth Rollins’ opinion that he should’ve been in that Main Event. Seth is there day in and day out, grinding it out while Cody missed most of last year.
1 day Cody is going to win those belts!
the only way they can redeem themselves is if cody goes man on a mission to systemically take down every member of the bloodline till reigns is left alone for summerslam
Cody and Asuka lost in typical WWE fashion. If he wins later on it won't matter anymore it won't be as big as it could have been at WrestleMania. I would say it's heartbreaking but at this point it's just normal for WWE to ruin good storylines. It didn't make any sense for the Usos to lose just so Roman can hold on to the title. Roman is evolving into a wild slapnuts LOL.
I’m so happyo
Roman is getting out of shape
As much as I like Cody, I'm glad he didn't win since he came back he's had things handed to him. But I was hoping that Randy Orton would have come back and helped Cody
Same o same o
So much BS
No matter how Roman win.. Always Roman Reign☝️
Acknowledge me
Predicted the whole match
I’ve been watching WWE since I was a child. This was the wrong move. Cody was putting this company back on the map😞
Theyll do this same match at wrestlemania 40, and cody will end the longest reign
Vince is the king of buying things back just to destroy them. WCW, ECW, Cody- just to name a few.
Oh the dislike button, please show me your number.
What a disappointment
cody should have won f**k the wwe
They have to make this a rivalry
Roman it's my favorite wrestler these times, but it was Cody Moment,that messed up
To all those idiots who believed Cody would win 😂 a tribal slap on all your faces.I love it when a plan comes together 😆
Now we have to wait till summerslam for a new contender. Tf is wrong woth the WWE.
cancel your subscriptions or peacocks, hit them where it hurts
How disappointing, let's move on
Codhy wasn’t ready
Mal Roman Reins pesimo perdedor no puede sin sus primitos😆
Without solo help roman can't get the title and the truely winner is Cody Rhodes and the game is cheating, Cody really doing a good job and gentle,you are the champion and hero Cody..
oNCE AGAIN HE CANT FIGHT HIS OWN BATTLE NEEDS HELP FROM USO,S
Count how many times Roman reigns fought Brock Lesnar before getting this title Cody can't just get it like that.
Just like Stings Wrestlemania. Pure disappointment and shock.
Seeing solo sikoa for the first time ☝
fans on monday will be chanting "refund network" "AEW" and prolly the worst of em to roman '"leave for cancer" all towards roman and creative... all cause of this one win.. it will be far worst then when roman beat taker at mania...
Cody should never had won Roman reigns have defended this title too much 😭 Cody should just go out again as usual.
Thank you Roman thank you
Reigns would win thet  as they would not need to break the streak of their product. Its all scripted.. you know that.
*ROMAN REIGNS WILL NEVER LOSE HAHAHA*
Acknowledge him☝️
Hahaha cody rodes has no match for roman
I'm stunned. Pleasantly surprised. Count me as one of the few, who rooted for Roman ro continue this incredible streak
Boy did you guys totally screw the pooch on this match. Unreal how bad the ending was.....not to mention Cody should've won! This was CODY"S moment! I'm so over and sick of Roman (can't win by himself) Reigns.... Won't be watching much more if this is the BS you're gonna keep giving us..
Cody Cutter, Figure 4, Stunner, Helluva Kick…….how many finishers are needed to beat this man? 🤯🤯🤯
No surprise Cody got Fked so they could keep their baby on top.
Very bor play..but super hero roods support..roman is cheering and boran player..
🔥🔥🔥🤩
almost every single match in this 'mania was a banger including this one, but the finish killed it off. the senile old man is back in the driver's seat ig
Cody left to start AEW while Roman stayed and held it down. That’s the only reason I can think of for Cody not winning the belt here
He’s losing them to Cody at summer slam
It's so Rock can beat him at Mania 40. If Rock can't be bothered, they can just run Reigns / Lesnar again and Lesnar can win it.
Cody had a great match. But this's still Roman's time
Night 1 was HHH Magic. Night 2 was Vince Mcmahon Magic. Lol. That's what Wrestlemania 39 was
Next on Backlash, Cody should annihilate Sikoa
What kind of STUPID AMERICAN RULE IS THIS? They should sink underneath the Sea for their BAD INFLUENCE to society
Again cheat roman 😢
Este combate era de hombre a hombre uno contra uno, Pero permitie la intervención de  SOLO Es un acto de evidente cobardía!  Solo demuestra que Román Reigns no puede ganar en franca lid contra Cody Rhodes.  Muy mal mensaje para la juventud actual:  Si quieres triunfar No importa que hagas trampa o que actúes ilegalmente!!  CODY RHODES ES UN CABALLERO UN LUCHADOR PROFESIONAL 100% Y GANÓ DE COMIENZO A FINAL!
What a set of characters. They just need a comic book edge like back in the attitude era.
WWE was starting to win me back with this build up. Then they reminded me why I stopped watching to begin with.   WWE sucks. I’m out.
Yep now I remember why I prefered AEW  good play WWE for making me doubt for so long  the Magic of Cody returning only lasted a year to make me forget your shortcomings  at least AEW despite its flaws doesnt do rematch After rematch after rematch to make everybody wins exept MJF and Jericho but thats more of an exception rather than the rule 😅
☝🏽
Solo had to ruin it
Well! I waited for this match and I AM SOO DISAPPOINTED! WWE, this ending was TRASH!!! Roman winning just shows that you don't give a damn about your fans. Roman IS NOT and WILL NEVER BE, EVER! on the same level as The Rock or the late great Yokozuna. You have got this soo wrong! It's decisions like this, that make me yearn for the old days of the attitude era. CODY RHODES DESERVED TO WIN THIS! Not roman
Cody told Solo he was not Ready Now look Cody wasing Ready for Solo 💪🏽❤️💪🏽 tonight! Roman Reigns 💪🏽❤️💪🏽 Congrats👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽☝🏼
Common WWE L
The bloodline..... kudos to Roman ....
Always gotta cheat to win. Would've been awesome if Sheamus or McEntire would have came out to take care of the other two. That way it Would've been just between Cody and Roman.
imagine booking that finish terrible terrible job
Absolute travesty. What was the point in all that build up and hype just for the match to end the way every single one has…bloodline interference and Roman retains. I get it that it’s probably gonna further the bloodline breakup by Roman winning and the Uso’s losing but if Wrestlemania wasn’t the right time and Cody wasn’t the right person then when and who?
Roman is really wwe’s thanos 😂😂
Didn't help that the next ppv is in Puerto Rico
what a bummer.
DON'T BE SAD CODY.... ROMAN WON'T BE CHAMPION WITHOUT HELPS FROM ALL HIS DOGS! STILL GOT CHANCE.... KEEP PUSHING HIM.
It's getting  boring now with roman wining all the time
Main Event sucks 😢
roman is sucks and so are hhh and wwe!
NOOOOOI!!!!!!!
🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Roma looking like he doing a vodo ritual 😅
I'm bored now
whose the next Indie Star to sign with WWE that they'll feed to John Cena 2.0? Jay White?
This was a hell of a main event, this match had everything except the right person winning
Hahahahaah Roman is undistputed 👆👆👆
Thus was the PERFECT time to have a title change, and then you end it like this. I understand that the 1000 day milestone is on the horizon and I do get that it will be huge, but as a neutral viewer after watching all of the build up, this was the perfect time for a change, but oh well...
My hope is that there is a longer term pay off. I remember Summerslam 2013 when DB got the shaft, but shined at WMXXX and got his moment and the pay off. This would suck if he ends up feuding with Sikoa and doesn’t win the title.
The ending was so bad! WWE you disappointed us all!
No WAY Reigns still has the belts 🤯
If this isn't a clear indication to AEW guys thinking of going to WWE that they won't go over, I don't know what else would. I feel genuinely bad for a lot of WWE fans. I see the appeal of the style of wrestling put on, but booking like this keeps me away.
It was alright by Cody rhoades he needs to challenge Roman again but do it in hell in the cell
I’m completely pissed off of that match. Cody should’ve won that match instead of that stupid idiot Tribal Chief! When The Usos lost their tag titles to Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn, It should’ve also meant for Cody to win last night!
WRONG CALL
Come on.We all knew Cody should of won.
Ya know I figured he was gonna win after the usos lost because everyone felt like this is finally the end of the bloodline he definitely gonna loose. While I hate how he lost it makes sense from a storytelling standpoint. The Bloodline is cracking with the loss of the tag titles, but they weren't gonna make it completely crumble in one show.
So glad Sofi stadium didn’t need to have those annoying posts that get in the way of your view!
So boring. Reigns has had it long enough, Rhodes was the perfect guy, the perfect story, the perfect moment to take it away. Yet again WWE pushing reigns for longer than he should be. IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO LOSE WWE. it's what the fans want! Make it happen already!
I'm glad Cody lost I never liked him
Congrats Cody Rhodes for becoming the new Undisputed WWE Universal title and dethroning Roman Reigns! Now it's the dawn of the American Nightmare era. And the era of Tribal Chief is over!
If this drags on for another year with very little excitement sprinkled in between the months. They will lose viewership again, but merch sales will off the page. There's a reason why TV shows that go for too long end up failing when a major moment happens. Though Roman right now is the best heel of WWE, but just how much longer will they book Roman to have a HHH-like reign of terror.
Honestly getting Hella old with Roman magically always winning due to interference and stuff.
After seeing some of these comments y’all just don’t know good story telling
This makes me remember why I stop watching wwe....cody not winning at wrestlemania
It was soo unnecessary for Roman to win
Cody should win that match
Damn damn damn damn
Roman wins because of bloodline's help
Roman such a coward. He Never faced his opponent single handedly. He gat such a boring history all achievement🤧😭 are not worth it
It's Sami who deserve to beat Reigns next year at WrestleMania
WWE does not care about you Don’t give them any of your penny’s
Cody at summerslam
Maybe Roman Reigns whole the title for 5 years xD
Thank you 🙏🏾
This and Bianca vs Asuka had the worst outcome. Night 1 is better
Solo is danger🗿
It's getting boring to see Joe (roman) winning by hook and crook! Especially when Cody should've won!  Once again, wwe let's a great opportunity go down the drain!
I stop watching WWE
Never give up Cody. After this failure, only you can dethrone Roman with the help of Kevin and Sami.
Vince ist Back 😂
I think it’s Cody’s time to carry the company. If he’s not given the title, I don’t see anyone worth the hype for now. If the title takes too much time on Reign’s hand, it may lose its value
Roman's entrance with the pianos is just MENACING.
Ok CMON HHH it was Cody's time to finish the story why u do him like that at least make him win at summerslam Thank god sami and ko won or else I'm sure we woudlvr rioted
Roman Reigns is running out of opponents
You know how they love there statistics
This Roman protection has gone on for long enough.  This was the perfect night for him to loose the title and you squandered the opportunity.  Cody should have beat Roman which could have lead to so many other matches involving stars Cody hasn't faced before. Very bad decision, disappointing ending!
I don't like roman but men, this storyline goes somewhere. I can't wait to see the new belt on  roman waist.
Why do they even allow the rest to be out there with him should been one on one so disappointed in WWE creative
Am I the only one who saw dead meat in the back
Getting sick bout Roman Reigns' cheating reign...is Roman Reigns related to Vince n HHH ? ....great story line but very poor ending 😢....Cody was th real n legitimate winner ,respect
Man this is hard to watch ? Reigns has zero charisma
So they're going for the 1000th day mark for Reigns. Hopefully then, after that, Cody wins the belt.
i love Roman reigns..❤❤❤❤
9.7k likes, 14k dislikes. Just for reference.
Well then. Thank you, WWE, for letting me know I don't need to watch another Roman Reigns main event until he loses - whether it's Backlash in Puerto Rico, Summerslam in Detroit or Wrestlemania 40 in Philly. Until the titles are off the guy you can only have act a heel (namely, lie there while his people get the win for him; I mean damn, compare him to Edge as a heel or Ric Flair and Roman just looks weak) after he performs his half dozen or so moves, I'm not gonna bother wasting my time watching the same match on repeat.  Hope the record (for the UNIVERSAL title; Roman only just hits 365 days with the WWE title on 4/3/2023. Which is important to note since the titles have been brought together and not combined, meaning the "historic reign" is for a six year old title) of a thousand days is worth the amount of disappointed fans. I mean just listen to that crowd - quietest it's been in two whole days.  And Roman's eventual loss too, since it's going to be an uphill battle to get your fans that hyped again.
So the one to dethrone Roman is going to be Jey Uso at Summerslam, i really think that the way Cody should lose is from passing out from the guillotine, but i'm not the booker so let it be
As a fan of the Bloodline, I knew Roman was gonna win.
Boring..wwe 2023..script..the wrestler win because helped...not real wwe before..the script is boring..
Greatest ending of WrestleMania Roman Reigns still undisputed champion the greatest still retains thank God u no what's next the uso's needs to win back the tag team champions and solo needs both the intercontinental championship and the united state championship then the bloodline is totally completely cause the bloodline is WWE 💯💪☝️🔥💥
roman reins is a John cena Bootleg
stupid scenario
jey uso you are officially the undisputed universal champion
Smoke in the mirror was better than this thème song
Everyone knows how to counter the spear
Roman you are weak...... Always you need your guys to help you win
Coward Romans, as usual, hides behind his group of cowards
WWE sure know how to ruin something 🤦🏼‍♂️ Stupid booking
Superb Match with Worse Result.. WWE got Screwed by some Dickheads in WWE Creative..
WWE is gone....
After that ending not gonna watch it no more it's getting boring
Expected Cody to win this match,but I guess it’s a long run..I mean it was also difficult for roman to defeat Brock back then until summerslam ❤
They really need to split the belts
Now that Cody is out of the way I see 5 possible options as Roman's Wrestlemania 40 opponent which are Randy "The Legend Killer" Orton, John Cena, Seth Rollins, Finn Balor, and Sami Zayn. WWE could also go the route of Wrestlemania 28 and Wrestlemania 29 by having a rematch of Wrestlemania 39 at Wrestlemania 40 and swapping the winners.
Without help he can't win
Day 1 was fire, day 2 was wrestlelamia, Seeing Belair, Gunther & Reigns winning just shows whoever is in charge at WWE has no idea what the people want. We don't want the same champion for years. Would have loved to see Asuka, Sheamus & Rhodes win, and boy oh boy did the air get sucked out of the building the moment Reigns cheated to win AGAIN.
Smart booking there loved it
SCREW Solo Man Cody Had It.
the worst champion in wrestling history his title is worth 400 days of matches won for foul play never proved his power One on One a stale stable and a Roman that everyone they know them because they are related to x hall of famer , a repertoire of boring moves . what brought Roman again in 400 days ?? WWE was supposed to give the titles to Cody and they screwed it up. it was better having the champions that this final will lead to another good year for Roman but not for the public that has a champion who fights 30 matches in a year .
The rumours are that Triple H doesn't like having 1 title and that he doesn't like the Universal title design. So putting 2 and 2 together I think the only logical conclusion is this. I'm assuming tonight the draft is gonna be announced. They're gonna officially unify the WWE and Universal title and put that on SmackDown and they'll introduce a new title for Raw which Cody is probably gonna win.  As for Roman his next big feud is probably gonna be against Randy Orton and they're gonna to get The Rock for Summerslam for some more Bloodline stuff. This title reign is so big at this point is that it just has to end at Wrestlemania. So by Wrestlemania 40 they're gonna need someone in line to beat Roman and I think that's gonna be Bron Breakker.
Reigns' reign is so boring like change the title why have 2 belts worn by 1 dude for over a yaer retaining every time because of someone interfering.
Nobody is gonna watch WWE after this.  Roman Reigns is EXTREMELY OVERRATED!
Good bless you roman👍️👍️👍️
Well, I guess all roads lead to Rock :)  IMO there is actually a positive side of Roman being a champ -  we still haven't seen a lot of good matches with him that have a huge potential to become bangers. I still want to see a rematch with Rollins, I'm sure there will be a rematch with Cody, also we can have long feuds with Lashley, Sheamus and Randy Orton. I think all of them will be enough to feed Roman and lead him to WM 40
Cody is going to win a tittle for sure in the future so it’s ok
D I S A P P O I N T I N G
Cody just need one more member to deal with solo.
I'm about to be finished with WWE. So tired of Roman Reigns as a champion. It's always the same, to be point of being boring, because you know that the "tribal chief" is going to retain. It was Cody's moment. HUGE L 👎
Paul Heyman guy never disappointed. Acknowledge Roman Reigns! ☝ Cody Time will come maybe after he take the U.S Title or Continental first
Right now it feels like WWE have missed the best chance to dethrone Roman… the entire situation felt like it was the perfect moment for Cody to dethrone Roman But!… With that being said, I can only think that they have big storylines planned 🤷🏻‍♂️ Let’s hope Cody gets his moment
Zzzzz
Cody lost because Triple H wanted to recreate his own Wrestlemania moment… against Booker T!!!
Poor decision from WWE. Obviously Vince is back in charge. They obviously haven’t read the room and listened to the fans. Cody should of come away the champ.
Oh come on triple h come on wwe  Cody deserve for win and of course you choose Roman No one wants Roman win and he win wtf is wrong with you guys
It seems that this company really has no talent. Thank you for your hard work, champion.
I could see so much of a weird or mixed emotion in Codys face It really spoiled the "contriversal" ending
No Rock again in Hollywood lol
Even if Cody wins at Summerslam it is not going to be the same
Y'all had a golden opportunity and completely botched it.
Don't let Roman Reigns win
HHH Sucks
Wth was that Vince it was you wasn’t it? Or trips? All because Cody smashed a throne I heard you were petty I didn’t know you were that petty imagine how aew stars will react the see how you treat Cody the wont come the rather stay in aew
Cody debió ganar y no el bulto ayudado por el guión y sus secuaces de Roman... lástima.
I really thought Cody Rhodes was going to win it, I guess it's not his time yet. His Story is not done yet. Sick outfit though, probably my favorite robes of Cody Rhodes
The like/dislike ratio is brutal 9.3 like to 14k dislikes  Also The ONLY reason  Roman won was because of the 1000 day mark In two months his regin will be 1000 and then idk make it to 8000 with this booking
Bad booking
Am I the only one annoyed that Roman still champion lol come on they packed uso out why should of packed Roman up too smh but great match if Roman ain't have his ppl he would of won
Am I the only one annoyed Roman still champion lol come they packed uso out why should of packed Roman up too smh but great match if Roman ain't have his ppl he would of won
After this I'm never watching WWE ever again. Sick of seeing Roman Reigns as champion. They brought back Cena, he lost. They brought back Cody Rhoades, he lost
Cody Is going to win the titles
Why wwe wrote only  universal title in the video title the didn't wrote it undisputed championship😮
I'm not a fan of mania main events ending with something to tarnish it, but Cody had to lose for shock value. EVERYONE expected Cody to win.  They told a good story and made Cody look like a legit threat to Roman. The first since Brock. This now let's Roman tell a story of barely holding on as this threat comes chasing. This threat that nearly ended the 3 year title reign. A reign that only survived for a soon to been Solo athlete.   It sucks that Cody lost, but this story, if told right....... IF... will build Solo and Cody up together. This also allows the Usos to still feud with O&Z for the belts. Keep this going until Survivor Series with the Bloodline vs. R.O.Z.   Idk. I'm not as pessimistic about this as most fans are at the moment.   Hope they do well.
it hurts to see the Usos luzin
Cody should have won but yet again roman can't do it alone always has to cheat
The big dog is here🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They spent this past year building up Cody Rhodes for this match, only for them to botch it at the very end just so Roman can have a “1000 day title reign.” Even if he does lose the title later on not as many people are going to care.
Cody Is stronger than the stupid man
Vince’s return is far too obvious. Never has the energy been sucked out of a generational storyline.
Awful finish. Cody should have won and if the idea was to make Roman win it shouldn’t have been done in such a lacklustre way.
Who will defeat Roman ?
I can't believe they did cody like that
If cody couldn't do it no one can
Cody Rhodes had a good run but he didn't deserve to be the guy to take down Roman's 900+ day reign given that he's only been back in the WWE for a year.
Man... now they’re probably gonna have Cody go after Solo and have him become an afterthought after building him to be the top guy, now the crowd will probably turn on Cody and he will go on a very annoying heel run... Vince’s return is too obvious. You had a chance to completely take the wrestling market and begin a new era... you can’t get this moment back. Ever.
Die WWE hat es wieder mal verkackt, Reigns nervt nur noch, ein weiterer Grund die WWE nicht mehr zu schauen, zum Glück gibt es AEW.
🤗🤗🤗🤗 right win
Roman cheater regins
No win for John Cena and no win for Cody Rhodes. What the hell WWE?! 😑
Tribal chief I love you and I acknowledge you my tribal chief
..... I know predictable but get the belts off Roman....
Romen win all cheating only stupid romen
waste of oppurtunity , cody should have won
Classic Triple H booking. Let the crowd down at the last minute.
Worlds wrestling cheating champion
This was the perfect result. Cody doesn’t need/deserve the titles, it’s not his time. Next Mania though…
Cody power man💪💪💪
roman = svck ALWAYS
The tribe cheif❤💥
sooo let me get this straight they let the usos lose but couldnt let roman lose ok wwe 🤣
I wasn't surprised cody lost because roman always need the bloodline to help him win just like the bloodline helped him win against Brock at summerslam
F Y R
Haha WWE is 🗑
This is getting absolutely ridiculous...
☝️
Biggest Rob of a man ever !!!! Worse than the Montreal screw job........   Boring reigns still champion . Well at least when I watch his matches I can always fall fast asleep . Man has the ultimate cure for insomnia.
Dude Cody needed to hold those titles at least once. Congrats to Roman but I can't watch another year of him being champion. They need to find someone (if not Cody) to beat Roman or they should do something about those titles like split them into two or sum'n
What did you think of Roman still being champion?
The tribal chief reigns 🔥
Robbed!
Cody is not ready to be champion
WHY WHY WHY
Cody you broke my💔😢😢
I thought with KO and Sami winning the tag titles, SURELY it was Cody’s night to win the main gold…but apparently not, just doesn’t make sense.
Roman Reigns is trash that doesn't even qualify as a professional wrestler. It's a WWE fan's nightmare for such trash to have to hold the organization's top title for 1000 days.
A Victoria de Roman não se deve a ser forte ou ter mas força, mas sim a uma questão de lucros para a indústria wwe, o Cody não daria tanta visibilidade e audiência ao universo wwe, a wwe tira vantagem dos fanáticos que os Roman conquistou com a sua aparência, lábia, e o que fez no passado com o seu grupo (Seth, Ambrose). Cody tem força pra vencer Roman, mas não o perfil para ser o super Campião por uma questão de negócios
This should have been Cody's moment, it was the perfect opportunity for him to win. He will finish his story at some point but this was such a missed opportunity one of the most deflating moments in WWE history.
Wwe suck roman biggest cheater in wwe history he should be shame making family look bad . Rock need come and knock him out.
Idk know about you guys but for me Reigns is not entertaining anymore. Reigns is just too much now
مفزش يا عمي
Les Responsable wwe devraient avoir honte, je suis fan de catch depuis des années. La s'en est trop. Je ne regarderai plus
This has vince McMahon written all over it, look what they did to sting, it’s like we’re not having a wcw guy going over
When will the reign of roman reigns end?
Lost respect for WWE Man it was Cody’s Moment and honestly if I’m honest Roman don’t even deserve them titles anymore it just boring saying Roman Reigns retains His Title Honestly A Joke should’ve been Cody
I'm not gonna lie I cried and I couldn't sleep
Now there is a look on the face of a guy who’s just been told he’s not winning 😂
I guess Vince has more control than was let on lol
Cody should have won…. Than next televised event. We could have seen the USO’s betray bloodline and challenge Roman and Solo. USOs win and bring Solo with them afterwards
Not in the right time yet
ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRIBAL CHIEF !!!!!
just want to point out, that the GOAT, the best there ever was would have NEVER  lost to Reigns...I truly miss...Funaki. lmao
The Usos f...y...
❤❤🇲🇦🇲🇦🦺🇲🇦🦺🔕💩🤕👄👄👄👄👚🇲🇦👚👚👗🤕🤕👄🤕👄👄👄👄👄👗💍📲🩱🩱👚👚👚🩱👚👚👚👚🩱👚👚👚
I knew solo would interfere coz Roman can never do it on his own
The Biggest Lost of a Superstar in a Main Event since John Cena in 2012 against the Rock
Cody will win it Monday!
Great work Wwe troll fan😂😂
rip. wwe
Romaaaaaaaaaaan I love you ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉 Head of the table ☝️☝️☝️👍👍💯👏
Cody Rhodes.... Acknowledge your Tribal chief the Head of Your Table
Roman reigns can’t win without the usos help he always cheats to win it pisses me off that he’s hogging both WWE championships
Not every story has a fairy tale ending. Really thought it was Cody's time considering they built him up to be THE guy to finally dethrone Roman but I guess WWE prioritized reaching 1,000 more than a great ending to one hell of a match
Without the Usos roman is nothing, roman can't win with out them, he could of lost the title months ago, but he needed the Usos to defend him
We needed a Cody win it was his night
that's why I don't like wrestling anymore it's is time for some body eise to be champion tired of roman reign being champion
코디 등장할때 소름..
Roman reigns can’t beat Cody Roman cheated
Cody will come back for the belt he hasn’t given up yet wait till summer slam Roman will get dethroned by him
Let's be real now, we know Roman wouldn't last at moment like these. Normally and I think everyone seen he need some sort of assistance to help him win, even though it's scripted it's very unfair.
Wtvr...just entertainment
this match was to be performed in a steel cage, so there was no bloodline interference. the real winner for me remains Cody Rhodes, I hope he makes this match again and this time Cody Rhodes wins
There’s almost no way man.  What sucks the worst is neither Sammi nor Cody took the belts.  I’m upset that it didn’t happen at Wrestlemania for Cody. This is supposed to be the Super Bowl of wrestling. Now we gotta see someone take the title in a different paper view from now. I just hope they don’t take Roman to 1000 days just to lose it right away because they wanted him to hit 1000 days.
The finish of the Roman match reminded me of why I quit watching WWE 6 months ago. Was sick of Roman then and was hoping last night would be the end of it. But no, WWE stuck with the same old worn-out champ again. Oh well, I really hadn't missed it. Wouldnt have even watched this if my son wasn't watching it.
Arrive.  Bore Everyone.  Leave.  The only thing Roman wrecks is the energy of a place.
Since all these years. Roman reigns never won a match without usos 🤐🤐🤐
Cody but on a hell of a fight but Roman came on top I for sure thought the bloodline was coming to a end when the usos lost them titles. But I was wrong can’t wait for Monday night raw to see if the bloodline is there and if roman has a talk with the usos but blames it all on Jey and the usos and solo will betray roman and start their own faction
getting tired of roman reign title run
Roman wins again….boring boring boring
Cody puede hacer historia
They did him wrong he won that royal rumble for nothing
Great match but Cody should of one.. I thought Roman was going to take a break from wwe?
Cody should have won.. wwe did him wrong. Why make him win the Rumble only to just lose all the momentum and backing they built up at wrestlemania?! Imo. Who can challenge Reigns for the title now??
*Majority is Talking about being mad on Cody's Lost. Why?? It's not over. Cody will Get What he Deserves. Just give some time. Make the Storyline Perfect.* *It'd be Irrational if Cody just wins the Rumble and dethrones the Greatest Story in this Era. It needs more Build-up, more Personal Emotion. Have Patience.*
So I guess its jey uso
I believe Roman 🙏 🙏🙏🙏
WWE sucks 😕🤮🤮 Roman reigns sucks so hart  900 more days wtf   This must be ende 😢😢
Cody should of won that hands down, Roman was ready to be dethroned
It also speaks volume in the trust they have in Roman tho, Brock still part time, cena part time.. Who else have a big enough name to carry the company???
Cody. Anyone seen my stardust gear...
I really think Cody should have won, but for me it's not even the fact that he loss, it's the fact that we couldn't even get a clean finish in a WrestleMania main event.  Horrible horrible way to end such a great match.  I would have rather seen Roman go over clean than that BS finish right there.
Not watching anymore Roman Reigns is boring
Cody didn't need this win more than Roman.
Roman sucks. It should of been Cody’s night
Tonight were meant to be Cody’s night. So I’m guessing Roman will be reaching 1000 days as champion.
C'est de la triche wesh
Roman his title reing won’t be for long cody is going to have his moment
I wake up to this BS? So stupid. Cody should have won. Roman doesn't deserve to have titles for this long
Cody is not ready to be a champion
Y'all have to remember he was cheated 😂😂 so of course there's going to be a rematch
WWE is the most washed out brand there is at this point. Having a old midcard all of a sudden run over 3yrs as champion solely off of outside interference solidifies that he cant hang 1v1
Y'all stay mad lol Bloodline is forever 🔥💯
The GOAT   ☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️
Cancelled my subscription and told my kids they're banned from watching WWE, it's disgusting they let this cheating go on in these matches, I'd have stripped Roman of the titles and suspended him, and the Usos, and fire Solo for coming back in after being ejected
ACKNOWLEDGE ROMAN☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾
Who in wwe is protected this man..... It is time for change. Come on man, if it isn't Cody, who then?
When will Cody win a championship
Great ending for a wm 😎
Roman🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Hopefully they let bobby lashly win it, Randy Orton win it or Big E win it fr, sucks Cody lost but he wasn't gonna come back with a clean sweep, Roman took 3 or more finishers and still kept the belt, His reign will end but for now he can appreciate another title defense, it's starting to become his personality at this point though so hopefully he figures something out when he loses the belts...
They always make Roman win smh
Overbooked to the hilt 😢😢😢
Wwe is comedy now they don't have heroes like earlier. So trying to run the show with Roman, who is not able to win a single match alone
It was Cody time.. Especially since coming back from the torn pack, It would have culminated the long struggle back and jump from AEW..
I think Cody should and was supposed to win but honestly the switch up of having him lose was shocking and maybe that’s what they wanted. Night 1 was better imo but we had a blast watching it minus the 50000 ads that were playing.
cody should revert back to the stardust gimmick. He is mid card at best.
Another cheating win for the Head of the Toilet.
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Triple H Suck
00:20 GOOSEBUMPS😍
"Everybody thinks they are the guy. Until they meet the guy." Roman Reigns' words to Cody Rhodes.
Worst thing to end. Poor decision again in the main event day 2. But acttually WWE makes the viewers shock on whos gonna win. You are wondering that it is cody's time but nah they turn your hopes down by that heartbreaking revenge of Solo anyways this is the best wrestlemania this era.
This match made me upset I’m tired of seeing this man win over and over again that was CODY’s TIME
Still glad Roman reigns is champion
I'M SICK OF SEEING ROMAN WITH THE BELT'S, WWE SUCKS CODY SHOULD OF WON.  GOODBYE WWE NEVER WATCHING AGAIN
Refund
Dislike
Wtf
I’m so pissed off 😡 I wanted Cody to win
I knew it was a bit too early for Cody to be the face of wwe but I don’t see a better way Reigns can lose those titles again at unless next Wrestlemania
They lex luger'd him😢
He only because of his family there
I'm not surprised that cody lost they are gonna mess with him just like they did when he was there the first time and of course the crybaby Roman can't lose either
The face of Cody after the loss its heartbreaking...
Noo. I actually thought cody would win
Hunter What have you done
The ending instantly lowered the match from a 5 to a 2.5
wreslemania 39 was great. except 2nd day's main event.
This feud should continue and at the end I beg for coding to have the tiels
I'm actually getting fed up with Romain and his henchmen. The way I see it is that ROMAIN can't win without the assistance of the Usos. Now my question is as follows: Is Romain really a champion - or is he just there to fill the team. Do we have to "Acknowledge" him for it..?
It's getting boring now with roman still being the champ I want to see someone else like that its always him who is winning someone needs to defeat him I rlly thought cody was the one to do it its just boring now
☝️
En qué momento se convirtió en el estelar si hace algunos años , no se atrevia a subirse al ring si Randy Orton , no lo acompañaba .
This is why I'm done watching wwe, let's baby Roman some more. He should have lost, it's really too bad. Just my opinion.
RIP WWE today CM Punk win once again
with all the negativity against Roman. I will always stand by him. His will always be my best. And he deserved the win. Congratulations Roman.
Roman sucks I hope broc gets him
Roman connot win without cheating his dogs always obeys his command
Well done WWE. This result means that the title won't change hands for the next 10 something PPVs. Great job.
I ain’t ever watching wwe no more
How did WWE manage to mess that up right at the end? How? It was right there on a plate for them and they messed it up!!!
i get it, the story was getting to a fairytale ending, and people are dissapointed because they didnt get what they wanted. People may say the atmosphere got sucked in whatsoever but thats the exact reaction WWE wanted from this end. I already kinda know this was gonna happen because Usos lost their belts , they wont let Bloodline lose everything at once. If usos retained i would have said rhodes were to win
wwe really sucks for not having cody go over
Thanks Roman, for squashing the moment.
I said if Cody loses I’ll stop watching wwe so bye
That entrance tho!!!! DAMN
If you didn't realize it actually made me think that roman would win since all the champion at day 2 wins them all. Knew it all along
You ruined it WWE.
It's gonna be RKO which will take away the dominance of the head of the table
This is why nobody cares about modern wrestling anymore.
I used to love wwe about 20 years ago whenever it was called on different name. It has become way too predictable and scripted/fake. However it is also amazing how many people don't care the real aim of the "show" and are capable of paying ridiculous amount of money to see actors in live action.
Cody should have gone over. This was THE perfect moment
This is exactly the think we all have been saying would happen if vince was back, not good.
WWE apparently screwed Cody Rhodes like they did with Drew Mcintyre in Cardiff. Cody should have been the champion in front of the sellout crowd. Give the fans what they need.
A main event with a no happy ending.... Sorry but Roman must lose the Championship.
These highlight videos are garbage just cuts to Romans celebration
The way they're force feeding fans Reigns is old.  We all know they want to fabricate him to be the next great thing, even though he simply isn't.  Can't wait until he wins again next year.  Ahem.
Yea great match but definitely should have made Cody win.   Like the rest of the 2 day show sucked. Ever match was terrible except the Cody and Roman match
Great job WWE💯 I haven’t been this hurt about a loss since I was little 😂
Very disappointed in this years wrestlemania unless at wm backlash cody gets his rematch and wins
stupid decision
King of the cheat..always play the cheat..so scared with shadow..wwe do something..we need next chapture..same episode...so bored...demm mennn....
Horrible booking call and all to keep the belt on Roman for 1,000 days. After 3 years, no one feels like a valid challenger, the moment is missed and Roman losing anywhere but Mania feels poor.  To add, I really hope HHH's plan to split the belts does not happen until after Roman loses. That would categorically make every member of the roster look like they were so bad, they had to make a consolation prize.  The worst bit is WWE write this and decide to do things like this. It's like the company has a fetish for cuckolding its fans and embarrassing itself.
THIS IS LIKE WHEN BARON CORBIN HELD WWE HOSTAGE WHEN HIS IN CHARGE, this sucks.
Cody would make a perfect guile for a street fighter movie
We need Jey to dethrone Roman
Alright who let Vince back
The Tribal Chief needed help from solo,Fair and square ,roman  reings would have lost.Big up cody.
I LOVE you my Tribal Chief! I ACKNOWLEDGE you my Tribal Chief!! ☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏻
You ruined it.
Well, enjoy another year of Roman with the belts, I guess.
yawn this title run has almost finished off the WWE.......why will people care about watching matches when you know Roman will just win again.......
Boring !!!! Very disappointed
Whose making these tables ?
Nice from WWE ....... they should first build this rivalry before they give Codey the belts .... he’s not yet ready
I demand a rematch without bloodline ringside pls
Dusty's son.... Ex AEW...  Smashed HHH throne..... ...why you're think he never won
Let's wait another year to see The Rock vs Reigns
Okay. I'm out. **** yourself hunter.
Wow seriously....... it’s time for a new champion
ID*OTS WWE REALLY LOST THEIR WAY
This has Vince written all over it..
WE ARE TIRED OF WWE ALLOWING REIGNS TO KEEP WINNING BY CHEATING. HIS MATCHES ARE BECOMING LESS INTERESTING. CODY DESERVES THE TITLE.
bro the ended sucked solo literly got kicked and he attacks cody takes of the jacket and stands in the middle of the ring bro is the refree blind
I give up! Screw the WWE! Screw the bloodline! Screw Roman Reigns! This killed wrestling for me
You know I get this is all scripted, but even so, they have scripted one match where Roman wins all by himself without the help of his goons. Cody should have won this damn match and honestly I feel like I wasted my time watching WrestleMania. Roman doesn’t defend the title and can’t fight any match alone. But it is what it is. Maybe Cody will get redemption at BackLash
Cody should've won.😢
This kept me thinking if not Cody then who? At this moment I can see someone like Jey. But man imagine the atmosphere if Cody won
WWE drops the ball yet again🤦
Me at 6:05 😏 ok Me at 6:31 😕😱🙁
Bloodline bollocks
Let's go🎉🎉🎉 roman Wins
you can tell the 2nd night was booked by vince, the whole program sucked
I’ve lost all hope for WWE after that match
As I said Cody is fine but not now to beat Roman
And still...
Man I love Roman!
They cheated him if it wasn’t for the Bloodline Cody would had a chance an he still do if they make it a rematch
Cody will win at summerslam   I think cody will form bullet club to rival the bloodline
WWE needs Roman
Wwe this match was false 😢
This is what happens when you sacrifice a perfect story in favor of a statistic (1,000 days). Tonight, WWE showed you where their priorities lie.
all hail the chief !! 😁😁
Worst ending ever! Triple H you owe him a belt
Roman can only win by cheating and does not make him the best
I thought Roman was really about to cut a promo lol
Cody is back to midcarder
paul's face At the end 😆
Well reigns will defend his undisputed titles on wrestlemania 40
Bastaaaa de roman reings
I like Roman, but Cody shoulda had this one.
We are tired of ROMAN!!!!!!
This was the shot to make Cody, and they whiffed it.
Capt Marvel
CODY DESERVED TO BE CHAMPION , SO SICK OF WWE KEEPING THE BELTS ON REIGNS
I really feel like the Rock will return one day, and put Roman Reigns in his place by defeating him and become the new champion and dethroning him once for all
HAHAHAHA TRIPLE H BAD BOOKING AGAIN HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Then he will fix it for like 3 months to entice those fickle fans who said Reigns is God but before they say Reigns is overrated.  Triple H solidifying his status as King of Smarks 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Haha HHH remembered that AEW throne slashing tantrum
Its ok Cody want to rematch at wrestlermania backlash i think.
Wtf Cody should have won
Cody is better than Roman
Cody would have been to predictable. Everyone had thought this since the moment he returned.
Cody should have won.
Cody Rhodes brought me back to WWE because of his run in AEW. Now I remember why I left.
Honestly they shoulda had Roman lose this. His reign is a little overplayed now
Cody would summon Stardust in Backlash but would fail again and next thing we know he's now Dashing Rhodes as a jobber 😂
Fake
Terrible choice to keep Roman as champ
Tired of this Roman reigns storyline it's become boring wwe must come up with some new ideas
Cody wanted to win it for his father. The American Dream, Dusty Rhodes. I know that sucks.
All hail the Tribal chief ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
World against Roman Reigns
설마 또 로만이가?? 태그팀 주고 월드챔피언벨트는 나둔다?? 그럼 우소즈가 도전자로 해서 다시 가져갈 확률 99.9% 일 처리 진짜 너무하네
This bloodline storyline is honestly getting so boring, especially with the usos losing yesterday it was almost over
Roman Reigns win❤🎉☝️
I’m done with the WWE and their relentless pushing of RR.
That "1,000 Day Championship Reign" is more important than ending this story on a great note it seems. Great match but the ending genuinely shocked me. I really thought Cody was going to just end this thing finally with Roman (who has been an amazing heel by the way). Disappointed in how they went with it yet sympathetic to WWE creative who now have to work double time in making this decision pay off. Good luck. If it's "Jey ends up winning the titles," yeah, I'm good on that. No thanks. Lol.
Noooooooo 😢😢😢😢
Roman is the best. He is the face and money of the company.
After seeing how the match had ended I think that Roman should be stripped of his titles.
I'll be watching Raw tomorrow night 🤔it's gonna be exciting 👍
This is so boring... back to AEW I go lol
It sucks !!!!!
I am so excited for the Raw after mania lol..!  What's gonna happen among the usos and Roman .😂
Wwe sucks now they are over hyping roman reigns cody rhodes deserved that championships❤️
First drew McIntyre, now Cody Rhodes, Cody really REALLY should have won
Bro wwe had an opportunity and they squashed it
TRIPLE L RUINED WRESTLEMANIA NIGHT 2
Wwe Go f yourself
For anyone saying that Cody Rhodes didn't have a build up to take Roman reigns titles.....your wrong. Every since his dad left the WWE without holding neither WWE or world heavyweight championship, it's been Cody Rhodes destiny so it actually was 3 decades of build up
Its sucks i just hope cody will form bullet club in wwe
Yes ☝
I can only be wishful that SummerSlam can be the next big thing for Rhodes. But the next PLE right now is Backlash on May 6.   This could be Cody's next chance to win the Undisputed Title. But it has to be inside of a Steel Cage. So that no one can help Roman.
Cody the winner. From indONEsia
We are tired with roman....am unsubscribing until roman looses byee
Cody was very good, but it wasn't his time. It was all planned out. Believe me on a neutral ground, without WWE intervention, Cody would beat Roman hands down
This sucks
Paul heyman reaction at 6:42 😂😂😂😂lol😂😂😂
no surprise at all, WWE has become a complete joke
The ending sucked all of my excitement away. Cody should have won for his father.
Cody should of won simple as absolutely ridiculous ending they destroyed the fiend now its Cody's turn to be destroyed
Thank you Roman. 👏👏  👏👏👏 Thank you Roman. 👏👏  👏👏👏 Thank you Roman 👏👏 👏👏👏.
What a load of bs! Yes I get it Roman Reigns is a heel. But does it hurt for a heel to successfully defend his title without any interference?
Romans run has been fantastically executed...until now, this feels it would have been a natural succession, cody has been booked so well since his return, but it feels like this was an opportunity missed. The pop they would have got for cody fulfilling his dad and his own dream at the biggest stage, and the fans know how much this would have meant. I think cody has proved here he is a main eventer
Very boring Wrestlemania. Since the majority betted Cody, would not win. It will be interesting when UFC, owns the majority of WWE. Certainly a heavyweight (retired) UFC fighter, is being lined-up to enter the WWE, and face Roman, at Summer Slam. Satisfied that the Usos, are no longer universal tag champs. Amen.
WWE fumbled the bag with this one....
Night 2 was horrible
Luôn luôn cứ sự can thiệt bên thứ 3,suốt bao nhiu trận đấu xảy ra ... Đúng nghĩa tay đôi đi😂😂😂
This is just Bad booking at it's core, amazing match but just bad decision making
So now what there's literally nobody else to go for the title just because they want Reigns to reach 1000 days
Disappointing ending, wwe.  Not what we wanted.
Roman reigns is not losing to anyone unless Vince McMahon says so!!
Was the Match, the Escenary, and the Place, but not the man!🔥🔥🔥 congratulations for Cody but it’s going to be The Rock.
ACKNOWLEDGE HIM!☝️
Hmmmm bullet club reforming to help cody win at wrestlemania
It could’ve been the picture perfect end to the Bloodline with the new tag champs coming in to help seal Cody’s victory. Such a shame it ended like this. Missed opportunity!
wow didn't immediately notice that was Dark Order's Negative One.
Bloodline is never done 🥰  Oh well he lost he has to be at the back of the line😂
Cody 😢😢😢
Roman Reigns had to win, WWE made the right choice. Reigns need to be Champ atleast SummerSlam if not next year Mania
Cody was insane in this match. Despite from the loss this was the best match in his wwe carries so far. Roman also nailed it. Hopefuly we can see cody with championship sooner. Probebly at summer slam. But this was a gud decision though. Roman should not beaten by someone who was not in the business (wwe) for this long especially at the grandest stage of them all.
Disappointed beyond belief. I think it’s bad writing, but it is what it is. Thank you for all of the performances for the best wrestlemania ever
Set up win.WITH YA BOI ROMAN REIGNS.. OMG..  Just got off work .. seen highlights of WrestleMania.. wow.. good effort guys. I mean fr..CODY RHODES.. YOUR### WRESTLEMANIA 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤+++++++++ and SOME. GOOD JOB BOY
Guys  Roman acting exactly being a king
So predictable i knew Roman was winning especially when he announced that he was close to a thousand days 🥱
Worst decision wwe has ever made. Cody simply had to win
Cody didn't want it 5:29. He let him go from the pin
I knew this would happen
🐶💔
People be watching WWE and think The Game HHH is in control, Roman will never lose unless Vince wants him to.
I hope they somehow have something bigger in mind because in a lot of opinions besides mine, Cody should've won this match especially if Roman is indeed gonna be gone for a little while after this. The match was incredible, but Roman doesn't need those titles anymore and this was too perfect of an atmosphere to finally crown a new premier babyface, so Triple H better have a genius plan to make up for this.
i enyoed the match. The match was great by far codys best match so far. The only thing that made me sick and lose my energy and hype was the ending killed the mod for ne
0:20
☝🏼
I HEAD ROMAN 👎 JAY 👎 JIMMY 👎 SOLO👎  TO YOU ALL 🖕
Cohdy rohdes doghter so cute aaaw i Love this momment how cohdy rohdes doghter hug cohdy rohdes 💪🏾💪🏾❤️
Still hoping to get Rock eh?
Acknowledge your Tribal Chief ☝️☝️
Idk why everyone is freaking out. Cody will have those titles before the year is over
Lol Cody was never going to win. It’s all about Roman in wwe.
without the tribe cody win..
Nah Cody should’ve won!….
I'd rather see Roman make 1000 days then see Cody win the title on his first try he needs to know what it's like to lose the big one in WWE
Why they keep letting this man keep the titles
My heart's broken 😢💔 I feel like crying , it was Cody's time 😭 but somehow this MF wins again it can never be a fair fight , when you're in a match with Roman Reigns , one of the reasons why I hate wrestling ,Cody Rhodes supposed to win that match and fulfill his destiny , he has to get another opportunity and take it with both hands , I have stopped watching wrestling for a long time but he's the reason why I've started watching wrestling again but now I don't know , I guess I have to go through this trauma until the guy finishes his story and become the wwe world heavy weight universal championship
You people sound delusional. Roman got boring last year, and has 2 moves like hogan and Brock!!! There is only so much you do, till it gets old. Cody would of brought in a great feeling for WWE, even if he losses months later, they could of really had the company on a high. But it’s predictable!!! I told my son ROMAN was gonna win again, and it’s only downhill. I was right!!! This is why guys like MJF shine over WWE superstars, because they stand out. ROMAN Does not, every win is a cheat, and perspective of a decent heel. fans will keep watching for him to lose, that’s the only draw WWE has right now….
Good match with a bad ending.
Lamentablemente las peleas son arregladas, éste evento tendria que haber perdido román
Maybe,roman going to be the champion for 23 more years until he reach 60 years old😂😂
Cody should have won
This is not suppose to happen cody has his chance😭
It was Cody’s moment bro now I am just sad
It’s Stiiiiiiiiiiiiing!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Wie schlecht ist Roman Reings er braucht immer nur Hilfe
Roman!!!!!!!
Yet again, WWE failed him
Total BS Cody should have won
Jay white is coming.
Bro wwe you better make Cody win at money in the bank
So tired of the same result. Time for someone else to be at top
Drew McIntyre momen part 2.
Roman🐐👑🔥
Cody fans are literally 90% children 💀 Best Wrestlemania since it became 2 days. Acknowledge your tribal chief and stop crying.
Im not watching as long as ragins is champion
I think it’s beginning split up bloodline. I think same other comment Cody should won but not this time(it’s my imagination pls don’t mad me😂😂)
Hahahaha Cody lose nice
Usos lost the titles so im guessing roman’s losing his soon
I now understand how AEW got so big so quick. I’m literally not a WWE fan anymore. They actually think that after 1 year that I’m gonna wait another year to see SOMETHING happen that is interesting. I’m burnt out disappointed angry and have cancelled my subscription so I can’t get WWE anymore. Goodby… hello TNT…
It's kinda getting boring seeing roman win all the time especially when he isn't the one ending the opposition
I know who’s going to dethrone Reigns…..  GUNTHER. Has to be. Two unbeatable forces. Man! That is a match I want to see!
Why can’t Roman beat fair and square ? Bruh i fking hate that ref, like no need to concentrating on Hayman 🙄 but still
Wtf happened to showing the ending spear and pin fall?
Cody suck.. he got no special move
They just can't seem to find someone that can rival or exceed reigns' star power. During wrestlemania 21 where things changed for wwe. Cena was the fan favorite against JBL whose influence as a heel overshadowed his lack of physique since he won over the people over time during that year. Triple H and Batista had the physique and the intimidation factor. With reigns, he not only has that influence as a heel, he has tht physique. Triple H was right when he said before that reigns was the perfect heel. I got Mcintyre to rival him tbh. How bout you guys??
When Roman completes a thousand days, he will lose the title
Lol I see a lot of meat eating Cody Rhodes fans salty, question Cody fans and internet marks....if Cody won then what? Like seriously you fickle fans would have turned on him in 2 months max. It was just too easy of a return plus was too predictable leading up from his return,  royal rumble to now wrestlemania.  The road to redemption is so much better than a predictable win and that's what makes real STARS. Look what Cena went through when he fought The Rock the first time lost but fought his way back to eventually beat Rock the next time. Njpw's face  Okada lost too Tanahashi at Wrestle Kingdom many times and even cried , but every year fought his way to the top. It's about the journey and story,  and if Cody Rhodes believes he's that guy then put in the work and hopefully see him again wrestlemania 40 Cody Rhodes vs Roman part 2. But I rather a Cm punk or The Rock  next year sorry.
How pathetic, I'm done with WWE until Reigns loses the titles, so sick of this Bloodline bullcrap, there was no better time to take the titles off Reigns than WrestleMania and WWE just wasted it. They definitely don't care about the titles anymore, if they did they would've taken those titles off him a couple years ago
WWE listen let cody have his moment
🤬🤬🤬 roman reigns all time is front and all brother
رومان رينز☝️.
The tribe of chief
ACKNOWLEDGE HIM.
Worst possible decision.
This is all John Cenas fault. WWE thinks they can just depend on one guy for a decade as their champion, I’m tired of it. I just want to see a new champion at this point. I hope he gets nuclear go away heat tomorrow night at RAW. This is ridiculous.
Yesssd let's fcking goooo ☝️☝️☝️. Respect to cody for being amazing as usual but the tribal chief remains undefeated.
Bro they always make Roman win like why
RIP WWE 🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️ going to AEW now and forever.
There's only one person left who can defeat  reigns which would make sense
THE USOS LOST THEIR TITLES. DONT U THINK THE BLOODLINE STORYLINE IS GOING TO MAKE A FULL 360° AND END UP WHERE IT ALL STARTED!!!!? ? SINCE SAMI ZAYN'S STORYLINE DIDNT WORK, I'D GO FOR THE BLOODLINE DESTROYING ITSELF ! OR ITS HIGH TIME THE PULL THE ROCK CARD
Cody Rhodes might not have won the The championships But he went out as a real American nightmare Roman Better be scared Because I just have this feeling this feud isn't over Even if roman makes it to 1,000 days as championship Cody Rhodes will find a way to get what he deserves When I was watching at home and I saw that Raft Hit 3Probably everybody's heartbroken the stadium and at home when roman beat Cody But I just wanna say this 1 thing The American nightmare is not done with The tribal chief
Acknoledge the Tribal Chief but Cody needs more build up Summerslam will be the right Moment
Roman reigns is actually over-hyped and over-pushed by wwe right now. Wwe actually is terrible with such a long reigns run now and fans are already sick of it...
See this why i hate roman reigns he wins because of help first the shield now his family he cant do jack on his own
Rematch
Roman should have lost
now i'm convinced the only one to beat Roman would be seth fricken rollins remember roman lost to him via DQ but kept the titles then seth will split the belts and drops the WWE championship to cody rhodes hope it happens sooner but wont be stunned if WWE drops the ball yet again
Horrible horrible ending to a great match!!!
Im not even mad that Roman won. Im just mad that he wrestles once every two months. Soo annoying.
Glad we have Roman as champion 🏆 again 💔
Had to watch Wrestlemania a little later than most people tonight. Right before the main event I get an email from WWE since I bought a nWo hoodie a week ago and it automatically subbed me to their email list and it said “BREAKING NEWS: ROMAN REMAINS UNDISPUTED…” Like are you freaking kidding me? Tried so hard to stay away from spoilers and you guys had to send an email out like 20 minutes after the event and ruin it for people who have to work and might be late to the party? Pos WWE gfys 🤬  Oh, and the ending was terrible.
Did anyone catch that they played Romans old theme? 7:14
Had him all hyped up just to be fed the Roman just like all the others somebody new who has never faced Roman should step up like a Elias
Look, even if Cody gets his rematch to win it, it's not going to feel as special nor will it feel like it's the "right time" more than it did tonight. He should've won it there and then.
It's high time WWE management knows that, we the fans are not longer happy seeing puppet Roman winning by always cheating. I think they saw it from d crowd
Yeah well that just goes to show that no one will beat Roman Reigns
Knew it jimmy and jey should go bk to there old gimmick bring that fire bk
See I told you Cody Rhodes not going to win I was right Roman Reigns won I was going for him
Roman reigns is Immortal 🔥
As much as I’ve always loved Roman I personally think this was Cody’s time.
What a fat disappointment. Idk why they do the same answer for all his matches. Idk the last time Roman won legitimately. I get he’s heel & all but Jesus it’s just getting repetitive. This was the one show it should’ve changed. I’d be fine for Cody losing just only if it was done differently.
No sooner Cody gave the phrase "A Chief without a tribe" I then knew the Usos will loss and Cody will loss
It is always evident that Roman cannot win any match for some time now without his cousins. Shameful..... 😁
Wwe you better make it up to the WWE Universe at summer slam we all felt broken hearted and screwed on what you did to Cody  It was his moment to finish the story and with the titles
I cant say I'm not surprised. It's the same recycled garbage ppv after ppv, year after year... Roman Reigns cant win a "clean" match in either a  ppv or a televised Raw/Smackdown show without: A) A low-blow. B) Outside interference.   Smh. And heres the kicker. WWE is not slated to have Roman defend his titles until Summerslam. 😂 Lovely.
Cody needs a rematch roman had so much backup which was unfair for Cody but it was a brilliant match.

WWE is not going to let their cash cow lose yet
Always Roman empire
The one  😎☝
Cody puts his heart out and maybe soon there's a rematch and Cody finally gets his moment
I was going to buy Wrestlemania but not after hearing about this disappointing end.
end the streak already man
I really liked this match, the story, even the entrances, they were incredible
Cody knew he was not going to win at WM39 but knew the USOs will lose the tag championship as can be proved on Smack down when he told Roman Reigns that you will be a Chief without a Tribe.☝🏽😃
Before I used to admire Román for winning cleanly, now he seems to me a complete fraud in the same way that he "wins" every fight and all for a stupid number of days as champion 🤦🏻‍♂️
Man, this dude just lost all that momentum. Guess he is not ready to lead the company yet. Wonder who they will push next to beat Roman?
Sometimes, the most obvious conclusion to a story presented is obvious because it makes the most sense. WWE dropped the ball on the ending of this match, which is a shame because this was otherwise a really fantastic Wrestlemania.
Cody la tuvo muy fácil, con el royal rumble entrada #30. Muy aparte de todo Roman Reings debe llegar a los 1000 days como Champ, Roman no debía vencer limpiamente a Cody pues pierde toda credibilidad , lástima
It's amazing that Roman can't fight alone. And he says to aknowledge Roman 😂😂😂
Roman is truly the goat
What a shame..🥲
Disappointing
Greastest moment in the wrestlemania Thanks for you  I Hope that play again those match ❤
Like this some bs
Wwe need to let roman loose man
Randy orton will dethrone roman reigns
5:29 😂
Romen ist ein Betrüger er kann einfach nicht alleine kämpfen
Cody should just live WWE
I hope this leaks into go away heat for Roman. What ending is this. Who booked this? The Rhodes family will never have a WM moment as long as Vinny Mac is alive. Dusty looking down at this garbage booking.
Continues devil's roman reigns...
Had a big feeling he wouldn’t win
Wow thanks guys what a finish 😒
Need undertaker back and kane to defeat roman reigns
Acknowledge your tribal chief folks
Acknowledge him now☝️
I'm glad WWE listened to the fans, it is not Cody's place to dethrone Roman, at least not yet..... Now bring back Orton and let him finish off this.....Roman Is a legend now, and only the legend killer deserves to dethrone him
Tribal  chief is a joke
ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRIBAL CHIEF!!!!!!!
Cheater and a chump had to take the eSy way to win lol smh
Roman sucks!
The ring and arena size comparison is so ridiculous. How can u even see if ur not close up to the ring
Solo is very Trump card
Hate him or like him he's still our Champion
What’s the point of saying “highlights” if you don’t even put in the winning move omg
Cody lost to Roman he shouldn't left AEW in in the first place he could of had a chance
WTF hhh bad ending it was Cody's time
Did Cody win
Bad ending bad job hhh
The ruined the story line. No what comes next
Wwe always ruins it !!! Ruins it every time !!!! Destroys everyone’s moment … left a bad taste in everyone’s mouth … Roman could have lost the title and gained it back next year .. this was the Cody’s time , to be that Roman level superstar the company lacks
Hahaha napunta ako dito dahil sa Bitag😂
I hate Roman 😡 he only cares about being champion but not about himself
🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻 you done screwed up time was now to crown a new champ. Night 1 was leaps and bounds better. Roman BLOWS.
Cody my man. I even bet on you ☹️☹️
I think the ending will be like this, all the bloodline members will turned on Roman Reigns and Jey will be the one to dethrone him
not surprised reigns kept the belt, i dont consider cody rhodes a world title main eventer anyways.
So, he loses at summerslam, right?
If I was Cody I would have walked out, I wouldn't have agreed to loose to Roman after all these build
Seth Rollins theme song is the best. What a vibe
Great match
Aye cut straight outta nowhere to end. That’s rad 🤦🏻‍♂️ lol 😆 y’all did ok till 6:32 😔
Once again wwe hasn't listened to what the fans want
I haven't followed a lot of Roman's title run so idk how often he turns to the Bloodline for support, but the finish to this match was such bs. Roman winning is one thing, but to have interference after interference after interference really undermines the whole "goat" thing for me. If he beat Cody clean, I would be a lot more on board with the end of the show. But having everyone in the Bloodline screw Cody over just makes me think Roman's weak. And then Cole and Graves spend the last five minutes of the broadcast talking about how legendary Roman is when he and his boys completely screwed Cody. It doesn't add up to me.
Roman Reigns sucks because he always has the bloodline helping him and retaining the undisputed universal championship
I know everyones bummed about cody not winning but in glad. I want to see hogans title run beaten by a current star.
Always shoving Roman down peoples throat 🤦‍♂️ he’s still champion. I came to watch after 2 years
Cody should have won but they cant made them lose the usos already lost
Roman reigns always gets the help of his cousins and that wiseman of his . He can’t win on his own . I respect you Cody , you are a winner in our eyes ❤️❤️🤝
Cody did smash the King of Kings Throne with a sledgehammer. No way was HHH putting Cody over.
Reigns is worse version of 2002-2005 Triple H
"highlights" when more than half the vid is their entrance 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
American Nightmare Weakness Cody Rhodes Loser !
He is the tribal thief always
Roman is going to relinquish them
Quit now Stardust
Roman is Chester camping 😂😂
The bloodline keeps wings and it makes us wanna watch wrestling the more.... I tell you no one has ever made love wrestling like roman reigns and it's insane to see them all with the Usos bloodline forever ♾️ 😊😁😊😁😊😁😊😊
VINCE MCMAHON Y PAUL LEVESQUE, QUE TENÍAN EN LA CABEZA PARA IDEAR UN ESTÚPIDO FINAL AL PURO ESTILO DE WRESTLEMANIA XI ?.....ESTA WRESTLEMANIA APESTA
This match had one minus and one plus Minus : Cody Losing Plus : one of the greatest WM matches ever
Vince>Triple h
But Cody is the man 💪💪💪💪 respect
Cody wasn't worthy to be champion... Up my tribal chief☝️
Roman reigns is the best
Roman va a llegar a WM 40 como campeón. Qué asco hermano. Es que me lo creo que pasa. Definitivamente Vince sigue al mando.
I hope Cody wins at backlash
roman is pushed so much and gets 5 wrestlemania main events and still doesnt have one fan😂😂😂😂😂 never heard anyone say roman reigns is their favorite wrestler
can even finish clean like that. disappearing to watch
thanks wwe whoever controls the youtube uploading … you get it 🎉
I rather dont wwe anymore
Vince be like.....
I never knew that Legendary Difficulty would be like this irl as it is in 2K23  it was as if i was reliviving losing to Roman with multiple superstars i selected in game lol
Roman suck  and the worst champion roman never defendet championship alone
He should have won that match he should have I'm so mad dude it was his moments he should have won that match she should have become champion this is so stupid
Only thing that could save this is if Solo betrays the bloodline.
JAJJAA pero no mostraste la cagada que hicieron con esa trampa que forzado meten a Román
worst ending ever. could have gone down as best mania match since hogan andre, instead will be like game of thrones finale. utter trash
All the build up for the fight for nothing
Will there be a rematch?
You think triple h was gonna let that AEW chair thing slide by cody? 😂
Lmao glad he lost. He doesn't deserve to win. He has done nothing but one match with his bruised chest or whatever. And they only did that to make him a baby face then just took a rest until he gets handed the rumble win. Meanwhile Sami has worked throughout the storyline only to be pushed back to the tag team picture. It should have been Sami to dethrone Roman, or could even be a triple threat. But Cody alone? No thanks.
Cody should have won
Brilliant booking wwe. Fans are so fed up of this reigns  burying everyone.  Ill just skip main events with riegns from now on as we all know the result. Yawnfest
Wake me up when Roman loses the Titel... Probaly at Wrestlemania 64 or something. This Guy is getting so overpushed that in a 1 vs.5 Handicap Match aginst John Cena, Steve Austin, The Rock, Hulk Hogan and Undertaker he still would win pretty easy.😂
That's the problem always is Roman reigns and it boring now
There's a greater story to be told here. Roman winning is the beginning of this Cody vs Roman Reigns storyline. Cody is still the guy, just not now. Let's wait and see where this goes before we start hating on the creative.
Wwe your scripts are trash! Cody was supposed to be champion! You robbed him!
“Finish the story” way to waste that one. Lose all that momentum just for summer slam so we can get 1000 days
Would it had hurt business in the long run if Cody won?
This match ending was the biggest miss WWE has made in a long time. Think of all the new storylines WWE could have made from this match if Roman lost.   I'm thinking Solo could have a singles run and not be in the shadow of Roman. Paul Heyman getting leaving Roman and desperately trying to get on Cody's good side or go back to Brock Lesnar. Roman could've had a story line where he's desperate to get back the respect of being the tribal chief and the Usos turn their backs on him or have a whole family breakup. Also if Cody was the champion, I'm certain that if he was to defend the belts, there wouldn't be nearly as much disqualifications or screwy finishes as Roman.   Roman's championship run started really well, It's just gotten to the point where WWE is doing the exact same thing they did to it's audience in 2015 - 2018 and pushing him down our throats thinking we'll enjoy it now that he's a heel. This years Wrestlemania had some good points and bad points and that's perfectly reasonable. Not everything can be perfect, but what most people will remember from this show is the terribly booked main event that in all honesty, made me wish Vince booked this match instead of Triple H.
Roman is still  no where  near  Austin  and the rock .  Love Romans fans delusions 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Im tired of Roman
Wrestlemania Backlash in May  So Reigns vs Cody part 2
Cody gonna win the next match just not this one
Horrible highlights !! Y'all didn't show cody getting pinned
Bloody sucka Reigns
This is BS! It’s time for Roman to drop a belt and he keep winning with inferences
Cody doesn't need belt he's very good
Cody should've won the match, if not for Romans cousin, they always keep showing up for him and saving him, if it was to be only Roman against Cody,  I don't think the match would've ended like this.....Goodluck to Cody with such a great performance!!!
This would be the equivalent of at the end of Avengers: Endgame, Thanos just gets the Infinity Gauntlet anyways, snaps half of reality dead again and kills off the Avengers. Seriously, basically killed 2 long-term built up contenders for that Bruno Sammartino reign.
Bloodline❤❤❤❤❤☝️☝️☝️
That should have been Cody match.
La basura de siempre con Roman... me tomo unas vacaciones de WWE
They only had Roman wins so his title reign can get to 1000 days
roman reign retain storyline is suck everytime. how many times he want pretend like the undefeated even though his not relevant at all
Bad booking. Roman has been stale for months and the only thing that saved the bloodline story was Sami. Now that Sami had his moment, this bloodline story will tank, Roman is going to start getting his old "go away" heat. No one is going to care about Romans matches anymore. He's beaten everyone, been champ for nearly 3 YEARS! BOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRIIIIIIIINNNNNGGG!!
Román Reigns is the face of the most boring company of all time
what a bad ending to such a great match, terrible booking.
WWE fans are truly idiots if they believed stardust, a mid carder at best would dethrone Roman 😂😂😂 ☝🏾
Cody iba a ser nuevo campeón si no hubieran echo trampa
Wwe want Roman to hit 1000 days and we all know that but I see comments wants Cody to win! How the hell you want someone to win a huge match someone who didnt even have a story with Roman and he was comming back early from his injury,come on just use your brains guys..
Bro Roman is a straight punk for this one
fu roman
With Kevin and Sami helping Cody, I thought Roman was gonna lose this time.
Well I'm done thanks WWE I'm a life long fan and this is BS. Seriously this was Codie's moment but unsurprisingly creative took a page out of Vince's playbook if it's a Rhodes they aren't allowed to succeed. Cody is white hot right now and this was his well earned moment what's even more annoying than that is all the potential stories you robbed us fans of. If Roman lost he he could've taken an earned vacation and when he returned he could've dominated everyone to remind everyone who is really in charge but no you chose Roman so you can fail to secure the Rock for WrestleMania 40 this level of BS reminds of the Bryan vs edge vs Roman edge should've won it then especially considering he never lost and here we are yet another Cinderella story ruined.
I knew Cody was gonna get buried tf deep into the ground when he came back to WWE. All that build up & momentum only to fall short & job to Roman. This is probably worse than when Shinsuke Nakamura jobbed to AJ Styles at Wrestlemania or when Booker T jobbed to Triple H at their wrestlemania. Very, very bad career move by Cody Rhodes. Should've stayed in AEW. I pray he goes back when his contract is up in 2 years.
WWE Official helping to romainring every time to win
Mistake HHH as your wrestler career
YEESSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!
I stopped watching wwe at 15 . I'm not a fool
Horrible ending wwe is finished
😅😂 this was not a good WrestleMania the first part on Saturday was better then this
The best to Cody rhodes
Had to be fookin Vince man.....
Only randy Orton can take it in personal match like this
Bro I can't believe this is one hour ago
Why hype Cody so much if they’d keep the belt on Roman 😒
For the first time happy Romen won,Maybe it's because I'm just not a fan of Cody. He wasn't the right man. The boring part about this is knowing Reigns will be on the winning streak for another  year
Congratulations 🎊 Roman 🎉
Cody is electric !! Instant legend in my eyes
Cody Rhodes was not the guy...Whoever thinks so should go watch AEW. WWE is the big league.
First they screw drew now cody this is getting boring now. He's got to lose sometime. Or not if wwe have there way.. don't get me wrong I like mr roman but far too much of him  staying champion
Roman is not champion   the refs has no saso
A luta foi até boa mais o final que foi muito ruim velho!
Roman reigns braucht immer läute die Angreifen müssen in Match  Meine Meinung cody Rhodes wäre der wahre Sieger
Fake as hell. Scripted also. Go watch real fighting like ufc. WWE is boring asf
What is the USOs doing in the match, Roman a family cowards. Like he’s been getting help from his goddamn cousins. You’re just a tribal chief for your family not in wwe. If you can’t put down Cody alone by yourself!!!!
Again Roman can't do it by himself has to have help to retain
Cue all the “Vince is back” comments 😂
The look on Cody's face tells everything. Pretty sure Vince was involved. No hell it was HHH's decision to let Roman win.
I wasn't able to watch the match. Did Roman cheat again and get away with his win?
Los usos siempre se meten ayudar a Roman, roman es un campeon tramposo 😤😤😤
This whole Bloodline story already far overstayed its welcome in its current form, it was only due to the extreme efforts of Owens and especially Zayn that it was even still somewhat watchable for the last few months, Reigns had the smallest part in it by quite a lot. To think that they likely plan to keep this going until next Wrestlemania or at the very least until Summerslam to have another realistic opportunity to end it or at least get the world titles out of purgatory just makes me not want to even bother with it anymore, especially since much better and more active workers than Reigns already made the IC title more prestigious than the two titles they just casually glued together anyway. Walter is the actual world champ for many by now, he had a superior match and unlike Reigns he did not need 4 cronies to go over despite also being a heel.
Roman Reigns 🇺🇲🇼🇸🏆🔴🔵🧔🏻☝🏼 is still the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion 🏆🔴🔵 at Wrestlemania 39 🌙🎞📽🎬🎦🎥🌟🏟🎆🇺🇲 but I hope Cody Rhodes 👱🏼‍♂️⭐💀🇺🇲 will be Undisputed WWE Universal Champion 🏆🔴🔵 soon at WWE.
Returned to WWE only to become one of Roman's rogues gallery.
The Best run in wrestling history hate it or Luv it
L
roman the goat!
Roman reigns the tribal chef a gagné mon catcheur préféré
Those of you who wanted Cody to win, may I ask for your reasoning other than it was supposed to be his "moment"? This is a guy who came back to this company a year ago, had a few matches with Seth Rollins, which he all won, proceeded to sit out the rest of the year due to his torn pec, comes back at the Rumble in January at the number 30 spot, wins effortlessly, and was supposed to just take the titles from not just the WWE's top guy but a a champion in the middle of one of the most intriguing and well-presented storylines in WWE history. I don't see the logic. I don't have a problem with Cody dethroning Roman, but WrestleMania wasn't it. He can slay the king at SummerSlam or whatever. The Usos losing is a crack in the Bloodline's armour. This will allow their friction from late 2020 to resurface which will inevitably make the distance between them grow more and more and simultaneously you keep Cody involved and eventually he can have his "moment".   For most of you people, it's all about the instant gratification. Clash at the Castle, Drew should've won because it was in his home turf and he didn't get his proper WrestleMania moment.. Sami Zayn should've won at Elimination Chamber because he's super over and the match was in his hometown. There's no rationality here. It's pure emotion.  This is a final boss that reminds me of Thanos and Kingpin. If the formation of the Bloodline was a slow build, then the dissolution of the Bloodline also needs a slow build. Now one may argue Roman losing both titles tonight would've contributed to this slow downfall of the Bloodline and I agree. Seeing Roman lose and become absolutely unhinged by not only taking out Cody but also taking out the Usos and Sikoa would've been absolutely phenomenal television, but like I mentioned earlier, the manner in which Cody has been inserted into this whole storyline, it would be a disservice to just hand it all to him on a silver platter for the sake of giving him his "moment" and him "finishing the story". The story will finish. Just not at 'Mania.
roman reigns is WWE!
Bad booking....Cody should have went over. Now he's gonna chase for a year? Winning at Mania is special. WWE blew it.
ROMAIN ....Always cheating
Closest 1v4.5 handicap match I've ever seen (counting paul)
Now whos gonna dethrone him? Randy?
Otra vez la misma mierda veo wrestlemania desde la 18 y esto ya es basura ,tantos luchadores y los dos campeonatos más importantes los tiene un puñetas que no pasa de los mismos 5 movimientos siempre ya no es entretenido esto ni divertido 💩😔
Roman Reigns llueve una vez más por cierto SE LO MERECE HA ESTADO AQUÍ MIENTRAS OTROS VAN Y VAN SE PREOCUPA POR TODO EL UNIVERSO WWE GRACIAS A LA WWE POR RECONOCER EL TALENTO MIENTRAS LO ABUCHEAN LOS FAN'S DE LA WWE.
Cody Rhodes is the real winner of this WrestleMania match against Roman Reigns. It's the cody Rhodes moment in WWE 🔥👊
The end of this match pissed me off royally he should have won a thousand times over he was the next big thing. But no we couldn't have that screw us all
it is actually the right call. Roman need to get to his 1000 days. Then Cody will do it again. Cody return is still fresh, so for him to take out Roman that quick after 2 years of Bloodline storyline is just not fair. Cody will build up once again....
Everything is perfect. Without ending
As always Roman had to get help to beat Cody Rhodes. I didn't like how this match was scripted.
W e is nearing a deal with endeavor group to buy wwe for 9.3 billion according to Wall Street journal article
So..Cody can beat Seth Rollins with a torn pectoral muscle. Seth Rollins. The man who has beaten Roman Reigns the most consistently. But Cody can't beat Roman? Vince is back it seems.
Yeah...... back to AEW confirmed, night 1 was better lmao
Ya aburren con ese campeón tramposo
Give Cody his rose he bring his A+ game to table but story doesn't have to end. When the story just begins with Cody just remember Never Give Up keep on pushing to next level. "Fly Just Lessons But Going Hard is Blessing. " REAL TALK 💯💯💯💯🙏✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿⚘⚘⚘⚘⚘⚘⚘🙏🗝🙏🗝👁🌏📚
HAHA !!!
STAY MAD AND ACKNOWLEDGE HIM.
Its supposed to hurt when the heel wins and the babyface underdog loses, and its best when the result is kinda surprising, most people thought the Reign was ending . To me, the worst Wrestlemania main events aren't win the guy you think should win loses, the worst is when it's extremely predictable or it's such a forced story that you don't care.  Is Roman's reign going on too long? I'd say no,  it's too long when it's predictable and you don't care, i cared alot that Cody lost and  I was surprised he lost. They aren't simply building up Roman only for the sake of Roman, they are raising the bar higher and higher for what it'll mean for the one who finally beats him and making that moment something that will feel special and not granted just because it would be a nice story.
The most boring era in WWE. Every time u know that Roman will defend titles, its the worst era in WWE since im watchin from 2008.
There was absolutely no way the WWE (Vince) was going to have a guy straight from AEW beat their world champion in their first match.
Wrestlemania was stupid 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
ending was garbage, bianca winning was also garbage. day 1> day 2 def
That's why i hate this fake wrestling they decide who wins
MY TRIBAL CHIEF 🏆🏆🏆
damn WWE f*ed  up Cody should have taken the Tittle ! would have been a GREAT rivalry after that . . .
Actually I think Roman winning is the fitting ending for WM. This will put him at 1000 days as champ in a few, truly a historic milestone cemented in his legacy.  I believe Cody will take the titles later at Summerslam maybe. If Cody wins now, fans will look at him like 'the boy who was promised a good contract and handed everything' instead of a credible champion. And there was not enough animosity in the buildup to this match, it's kinda like 'I respect you, may the better man win'. When it turns to 'I'll destroy you once and for all' after a painful loss, Cody will have his time to shine.
So bored off WWE keeping him champion FFS
Solo sikoa won tonight
Lauda dekha Ra hai cut gar k
It’s the perfect time to get back CM PUNK
Imo this was a complete waste of a run, buildup and a case of the planets being in perfect alignment. Everything was so perfect for the big payoff of having Cody win for his father at Wrestlemania and win the ultimate gamble of betting on himself, to have THAT story immortalized at the showcase of the immortals.  I watched Mania this year at a WM watch party and the conclusion of the Main event completely sucked the energy out of the room. We we were all so deflated after following this storyline and coming into this. Bummer.
I'm proud of wwe and your choices
Roman reigns always needs help from he's cousin he could never do it alone ever since they became the bloodline cody supposed to the new universal champion
I was waiting for this for Cody to win but there's WWE wanting Roman to have a 1000+Days Reign
We just have to live with the fact that Roman is in God mode now, and to me, I feel like Roman still deserves to be champion
Wonder what's happening on AEW dynamite
Its official, Reigns is the most protected wrestler of the generation. Cody's momentum is dead, he has no rematch lol sad booking decision
Once the uso's lost on night 1, it was obvious that Roman would win on night 2.   Also, I believe if the fans weren't so vocal online that this was "Cody's time" and were so sure that he was going to win, Cody would of won. WWE don't like it when the fans are so sure of something, they then like to swerve the audience.
You are the best wwe
I said and boom it happened,the feeling the happiness am feeling right now is unquestionably
Cody 👇🏼
0:19 wooooahhhh
The Usos keeps interfering with all the damn matches not cool ... Roman has to learn to take the L.
This was a storyline that could have, would have, and should have been great...But then I remembered it's WWE And their writers suck...so what's Left but to drag it on....for the Luke warm money grab. 😴😴😴
I said after Cody beat Seth with a torn pec that he was the only person that could beat Roman. Then he won the Rumble and it felt like it was meant to be. The amount of hype and love behind him it made sense. This was the moment, especially with the Usos loss yesterday. I don't know how Roman loses the belts now because no moment will match this.
It's gonna be Bron Breaker isn't it?
Yeah....Vince is back in power alright
Let's wait for summer slam
WWE should Fix this right away
Does this remind anybody else of triple h reign of terror. This was supposed to be Cody’s moment just like at wrestlemania 19 is was supposed to be booker t moment
Roman sucks
Trash ending as expected.
1:10 Cody which his child
I was loving WM until Cody lost…dumbest decision ever 🙄🙄 even if he gets a rematch, it won’t be close to the energy in that arena tonight….damn
Match was great but man am I disappointed. I came back to watching WWE television because of this whole rivalry but the momentum has been completely killed for me. Back to just listening to the news now cause I’m over it lol.
Once Roman reaches 1000+ days as champion Cody or someone will beat Roman
I think adam pearce should make redefense the championship  against Cody Rhodes and Adam pearce should make rules like if Roman reign cheats or get help from anyone he loses championship
heel homelander Cody will win the big one. I called it first then, I still called it now.
This will be the last time I see WWE I'll better see AEW This is a big nonsense XD Something so high they threw it away 💩💩💩🗑️🗑️🗑️
☝🏽
As always Roman cheats to retain
Acknowledge the Tribal Chief! 👊
Cody can go back to AEW and finish the story with Tony Khan instead lol
The American nightmare will take those titles away from Roman reigns
Common wwe L. Had every chance to do the right thing...
What a disappointing finish. All this to surpass a scripted record that no one cares about instead of having a real WrestleMania moment after a great build up.
Definitely disappointed the the wwe universe!!
Had cody return for nothing smh 😡😡😤😤
I am almost completely done wwe man let the reign end.
We need Cody to Win, not just for his dad, not just for his brother not just for his family legacy. But for himself, he deserve the big gold
People expected Cody to win so much, I’m kinda glad he lost. The storyline kinda ends once Roman loses his titles. Also I prefer Sami to take it
Wait roman never win is roman give up cause he cause can't win lol
The one and only roman❤
It’s All For You Roman…
Genuinely don’t understand the choice to have him lose after setting all that up, it was literally the perfect time to have Cody start a great reign as champ. Roman has already had a long historic run as champion like come on. Knowing them the reign is gonna end in some dumb anticlimactic way or hell with as hard as they push Roman I legit wouldn’t be surprised if he stays champion most of the rest of this year
roman vs cody    What a match 🔥🔥🔥🔥amazing
Well you screwed that one up
This match reminded me of Shawn Michaels Vs. The Undertaker at Wrestlemania for some reason.
reigns , you win becaus big help, i think you loser
if cody wants a rematch it should be an i quit match i watch every roman reigns match and clearly roman reigns has never been in an i quit match so if cody wants a rematch do it in an i quit
Bro they are milking the f out of bloodline
I have a feeling that they're gonna keep Roman Champion until WrestleMania 40 for the 40th Anniversary and have it be a Triple Threat of Reigns Vs. Rhodes Vs. Zayn, and then they'll find a way to split the Titles and Cody will walk away with the WWE Championship, and Sami with the Universal Championship.  Seeing Roman's two biggest enemies bring his downfall would be poetic.  Especially if Sami has another banger of a year like 2022.  That guy deserves a World Title, and so does Cody.
Even the Reff had to rescue the joke chief and had to delay the count because someone forget to kick out.
WTF wwe is done for
Triple H really screwed us with this one man.
Worst WrestleMania ever
See you at wrestlermania backlash roman🖕😏😏
This was Cody's moment. Even if he wins it eventually it wouldn't feel the same as this. He had to finish this story WWE failed him.
Roman you are not a man you couldn't do it by yourself you loser, congrats Cody
Roman 🐐
they're building for the rock vs roman at wm40. roman to go undefeated whole year and if he makes it he'll fight the rock for the title and for the real head of the table
I will quit watching wwe from today. The storyline is too predictable and it is just too boring to see how roman maintain his champ.
Ksi vs roman
And the script wins again
Idk why but I was thinking of Homelander (The Boys) when I seen Cody wearing his jacket 😂
Daaaaamn wwe is back yo!!
Lol all the cody rhodes fanboys crying this foo is trash 🚮
R I P : roman reigns
More money in the chase and redemption arc
This has genuinely gone on way to long now wrestlemania should have been the even that Roman gets beaten, it’s become way to obvious to the point of thinking it’s just obvious that Roman will always win. Give someone else there time now become boring, the whole story with jay also got ruined  he should has turned his back in Roman that was such a awesome build up for what ? Nothing
Sooo glad the LISP wonder didn't win, this dude is hot GARBAGE!! They keep using his deceased father to try and get him over smh it's typical wwe and disrespectful, dude needs to stay a mid card wrestler
Imagine if it was Dusty Rhodes who defeated The Nature Boy Ric Flair for the WWE title instead of Bret The Hit Man Hart. Then this match here will be more meaningful, just like when another Paul “E. Dangerously” Heyman guy Curtis Axel won the intercontinental title just like his father Mr. Perfect.
It was a Wrestlemania moment...it was a Cody's moment...it was a  Rhodes family moment! WWE is 💩
The weight on Roman’a shoulders for carrying WWE universe this long , No other superstar fit on the mountain of relevance like him
In all honesty, Roman winning is actually the best thing to do if the Bloodline storyline needs to end. The following weeks we will see the implosion, possible Usos face turn and Roman will be defenseless. It just sucks that Roman might lose at Summerslam, it's better for his reign to end at Wrestlemania. We all know that won't happen though, as they're only aiming for 1000 days for Roman as a champion.
Legendary Championship Match Tonight!!❤️🙏🙏🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🐐🐐🐐🐐
Aew failed at wrestle mania
That's the reason why and dreams do come true when you put your heart and dedication in the company that you work for and choose to work for as nothing to do about come back and being that poking.
Thank you wwe  I really thought for a moment that cody would win  There is no one who deserves to win the undisputed title as much as seth rollins  He started roman reigns and he will finnish him
Acknowledge the tribal chief 💪☝️
As much as it should have and could have been Cody's time, I don't think Roman will drop the title until he crosses the 1000 day mark. WWE needs new markers, new needle moving moments because they're becoming too hard to achieve. Takers undefeated WrestleMania streak, first ever undisputed champion Chris Jericho, Rick Flair and John Cena winning 16 World titles and many more. Roman will cement his legacy by achieving 1000 days first I think until WWE gives Cody his deserved run.
No. I'm boring roman.
Cody
Did you really think it was gonna happen? Did you ?  SIKE !
It was Cody's night, Roman is so predictable the one who only wins with help is not a true champion who doesn't win by himself.
Bs
I knew it! I knew it! The result will be the same as before, nobody can defeat Roman as even the Beast can’t beat him twice. However as much I was rooting for Cody as I am tired of Roman, but despite knowing he didn’t seem to have much of a chance as he was not strong enough as a new face to defeat Roman Reigns. Its a letdown, we could have a new champion in Cody but nope.
I had a feeling he was gonna lose because of how late he came into the bloodline fued, now they about to be fueding until next year's WM & then he'll get the big win, but Cody put up an amazing fight, his father would be proud!
I think Dean Ambrose or Cm Punk will return to WWE to dethrone Roman Reigns
I support Roman but props to Cody he did really well
Acknowledge him☝🏿
This was a disappointment 😞
Buwisit na dissatisfied Ang mga tao
The fact that the crowd was so quiet at the end just tells you this was a bad booking
It hears Reign's old theme, right?
Roman = supertanker
In my honest opinion cody should of won, it would of made more sense.
I said this before but people have short term memories. This is Sami’s story to finish. The roar when he struck Roman with that chair was the loudest I’ve heard in years.
Not only does it suck for the fans right now, but Romans legacy will be forever be the guy that one person pushed to the moon and never got over. He could and probably will hold the belt for 1500 days and no one except Vince would give af. Meanwhile other dudes aren't getting any younger.
恭喜羅曼雷恩斯 衛冕希望他能 再接再厲 雖然 對手很強 還是一樣不屈不撓 冠軍 鞏固你的 雙冠王 為你喝采❤🎉
We need Randy Orton back to help Cody Rhodes I deserve a rematch on Monday night raw it's was so close thanks to solo sioka attack Cody behind
Same ol same ol. Roman Reigns snoozefest
Roman reigns retains the title yes
soo  this big long storyline... well not so much with cody,   but the hype and build up and it ends with how his other  30 wins have ended.. hmmm way to go.. way to make roman look like he cant hack it on his own and damn it i didnt even get to see a randy or rock  surprise lol
regardless on codys loss, it was an amazing performance and will be etched in the best wwe matches ever made. theres no doubt he'll be champion soon
Roman Reigns just can't win a match by himself he always have the other 3 other bloodline cockroach 🪳 to intervene and that's not a win to be proud of.SHAME
No es el momento de cody ,lo están forzando un par de meses y volver para obtener los títulos
I love the head of the table
I’m sad to see Cody’s lose
use me as a dislike button
Jai shree ram
I'll still support cody rhodes. He really inspires me to do better.
This is getting boring now bloodline need to be locked or blocked in a room like stone cold used to do with the radicals
Man I thought Cody Rhodes won? I saw a video clip of him holding the belts so I clicked it got tricked! but oh  well Roman's Toughest challenge since being Undisputed WWE Champion? maybe since Brock Lesnar. Will this feud continue maybe. lets how this plays out!
EXCELLENT ENDING  !!!!! PERIOD !!! CODY CAN WIN @ SUMMER SLAM !!
Cody should've won the match. It makes no sense that Roman still has those undeserved belts. He defended them a few times only and he always wins because the Usos come to help.
I wanted Cody to win 😢😢 Roman Reigns doesn't deserve to be a champion, he can not win by himself
wow no way he WON  wow amazing
Now Cody is on the bottom, first US Champ, then IC, then again Universal or maybe Cody leave WWE again. So long Vince is, Cody never wins.
There's a reason why is THE TRIBAL CHIEF 👑☝🏽🩸
At least Roman got it done now the usos have to get there's back
♥♥Jai shree ram♥kattar hind♥like?
roman reigns is a cheater as always because he needs the usos and solo to win it roman is an undeserved champion clearly not the G.O.A.T
So disappointed, this match ruined what was otherwise a good pay per view
Paul for the clutch
everyone was wrong,, everyone predicted,,, wrong,,, maybe somewhere else,,, ahhhhhhhhhhh
Well WWE just made a BIG mistake, they are going to suffer the consequences, and rightly so.
But but but......he's Dusty's son. LMAO
It’s evident from the results of night 2 that Vince McMahon was in charge of booking. His boner for Roman reigns is still going hard as ever, pretty much all the story line leading up to this WM was the bloodline story arc coming to an end or hiatus, especially with the result of the main event on night 1. Don’t know if triple H and VM agreed to book a night each but because of the results of night 2 it just seems a confusion conclusion to night 2 and we’re going to get this bloodline arc for the next 1-2 years at least and it’s going to get very stale now, it’s going to be rinse, repeat until he faces the Rock next year, Rock won’t win because it wouldn’t make sense to have him win the belts unless Roman has lost the belts by this point which let’s be honest - it’s unlikely   Having Shane McMahon make an appearance, there was no way Triple H would’ve made that call.   Edge beating Balor was an odd choice, even with the delay cause of the cut, if Finn was going to win you’d finish the match early but I don’t think it was ever the result that was booked.   Such an anti climax from night 1, if they make a new championship it’s just not going to make sense to put it on Cody now, it’s like winning 2nd prize and celebrating and if they do make a new belt, it’s going to take away attention from RR being champ for such a long time to a point where people eventually won’t care when he does lose it. It wouldn’t surprise me if they kept it on him for the next few years and it just gets forgotten about, people got sick of Brock holding the belt to ransom all the time but at least he knew when it was best for business to lose it.
It was a great match. No one should be upset that Cody lost. The story was incomplete and he’ll get his chance. Trust me, Cody has future WWE Champion written all over him. It’d be a stupid booking decision to not give him the belts eventually
WWE hates their fans and they never want to give them what they want, they want to continue to shove a boring and overrated bum down the fans throat's. When will you WWE fan boys wake up?
They stole the fight
disappointed on the main event tbh, what's the point of winning the rumble and the usos losing if roman is going to win damn.
Los gringos al dejar de comprar un poco la mercancia del Roman haran que pierda los titulos. Pero mientras sigan comprando, su reinado llegará a los 2000 dias.
I understand the frustration of having roman as champion for so damn long but this reminds me of those moments that i had in my childhood when i really thought a person was supposed to win or should win and instead they lost and alot of ppl (including myself) were upset .
Stupid!! Really wwe you couldn't let Cody win ?? I can almost see it now WrestleMania 50 and still undisputed wwe champion Roman Reigns!! 😂 Wtf
Horrible
Soon as I get back into wrestling this company reminds me why I stopped watching in the first place
Cody should've been the one to walk out as the new champ.. smh😑🤦‍♂️
WWE 🖕🖕🖕🖕
They proved they don’t actually know what they are doing. Sad to see such a stellar card totally overshadowed by night 1. It really feels like VKM saw the reaction to night 1 and said “hold my beer…. I can do the exact opposite”.   Sad they wasted so much of a good thing. Was the first time in a while I was genuinely interested in watching wwe. With this I’m pretty sure I’m done. Couple that with the way they delivered on n1 I seriously surprised but I honestly was about to watch the replay but once it accidentally played the highlights of n2 I was over it and decided to watch it later… maybe. Just so much great story and the only reason I could stand Reigns was this seemed like it was building to a climax not some anticlimactic bs VKM style absolutely ruined something organic and over af.
WWE IS suck
WWE has done it again ...first it was Asuka's streak and Now Cody .. I think it's time I grow up 😅😂
Immer das selbe...
Man whenever roman is kicked, I love it
I loved watching all the videos and reading all the articles about what Cody's next steps are after winning tonight and now it not happening  Hahahahaha
aside the fact that cody should have won.....can we talk about how well Roman sold that Cody Cutter
They can't ever let him do it on his own
Aknowledge him ☝🏽🩸❤️💪🏽
I said this a week ago, Cody is not a man to beat Reigns, 😂😂😂
he left AEW to lose?
Bro with this match and Cena's match im so freaking disappointed
Cody....doesn't deserve championship run yet.... His not the one to take down roman it should be jey.
Worst mania in ages
And still
Cody should have won they ruined the show with the ending
cody rhodes should be turn to super saiyen 2 with this intro
We need his theme working with the codyvator in WWE 2K23 right now!
☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️
Man in green and hat i see him at every big wwe  event
Hhh isn't that great after all
I disliked this match the only way I will watch wwe again is by letting Cody win
The Rock , Hulk, Austin were the best champions, The Rock the  peoples champ of al time,  he didn't have he's family to help him. He done it all alone.
U guys are overreacting. I though it was Cody’s time too but they haven’t failed us with this storyline so I fully trust them to not ruin it and keep growing Cody. Had he won I bet the fans woulda turned on him by summer slam.
this was an amazing fight
So so boring
Damn that entrance was electric ⚡️
rhata it i quitt wwe
👎👎👎👎👎
Next Roman opponent : Triple H
A rematch will happen tomorrow night and cody will beat him, mark my words
I’m glad Sami and KO and Undisputed tag team champions🏆🏆🏆🔥
Y’all killed Cody’s momentum.
And Booman Lames wins again. Wwe will never change
Knew wwe was going to screw Cody.this was all Vince
They’ve booked that so so so wrong, that should have been Cody’s time to end the story, I love Roman but it was Cody’s time
Same old 💩
You Know Vince had to write this 😒
My and our trible chief Roman Reigns is retain his title and defeat Cody Rhods 💪💪💪👍👍👍👍
Looking forward to Cody winning the titles at Summerslam
This sux
cody holding back his tears during his entrance knowing he won't be holding the belt at mania
Ill tell something Roman is a bozo bc he cant win a fight he can only win if the bloodline is there
Same things happens in the ring always ,  referis are proforming more then the superstars always they fall down and things happend , that’s is boring wwe it’s so boring
Perfect ending to an epic title match!
Acknowledge your tribal chief............ AND STILL 🖕
I hurt Solo until his death,, Is the one who caused Drew to lose at Clash of Castle
Cody won our heart 🎉
☝🏽
Cody was supposed to be this man at mania and take the belt
Wrong guy won
로똥강점기ㅆㅂㄹㅁ
Por estás mamadas uno deja de ver la wwe.
Trips wouldn't let this happen, Vincent Kennedy McMahon is the real villain in this story.
Watch him miraculously win tomorrow 😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Cody should have won! lols omg... ;_;
This was a massive rip off to everyone who paid to see that match, too many interruptions during the match were ok but to have one more interruption to have reigns win is just in bad taste. I would’ve rather had Roman or Rhodes win clean
Complete Trash
So am I the only person who wants roman to win  a match by Vince literally walking to the ring getting a chair and beating the hell out of his opponent then Vince has a insane celebration with roman and hugging the hell out of him
I'm sorry but I wanted Roman to win, he's such a great bad guy. The day he loses the title WWE will lose quite a few viewers, trust me. This was the right choice
What a stupid winner. Cody deserved it.
I knew Roman wouldn’t loose I had faith in him the whole time when everyone doubted him
I love wrestling and I praise WWE balls to make the decision to keep Roman Champion. Now for those of you who are say that Cody “he deserved it”, “it was his moment” then let me tell you that you know nothing about wrestling and you belong more with the minor leagues in AEW. We are literally contemplating the BEST and I mean THE BEST character in WWE history and you still mad because he is a part time. Wake up you are missing what true classical wresting is. I salute those fans who acknowledge THE TRIBAL CHIEF ☝️☝️☝️, you guys are real wrestling fans. I’ll be seeing you next year, WRESTLEMANIA 40 Roman Reigns vs Cody Rhodes 2 their rematch.
Plot twists are my favorite part about wrestling and man I really believed The Demon, Asuka, Cody, were going to win I got assumptions wrong I like it! Hell even I thought that Shayna and Ronda weren’t going to win because that would’ve been too predictable so I got that wrong too
Imagine being upset that Stardust lost at Wrestlemania. 😂
Seeds planted for the inevitable Bloodline split. Not what everyone though but I'm taking it.
I hate this roman
Te amooo roman ❤
Cody vs. Seth vs. Roman *Wrestlemania 40*
This kid need a re match with no body coming in it
People dont give reigns credit, he boosted cody, sami and kevins career with his his storyline. And hes gonna boost more people and make them bigger. You gotta give him credit, hes selfless. He wants everyone else in the business to become bigger , he said this in an interview. Cody winning, would have limited every other wrestler with potential. Whoever is gonna beat roman, will have the biggest boost in their career. Good job roman and cody.
Wwe has just become too stale. I’m done
Nice try Cody
Moving the crowd with one hand.....that's the tribal level their
Triple H playing Vince old dirty tricks smh how long Roman Reigns gonna be champion like untill 2040 lol this show sucks
Worst Title Run in WWE History overrated affff
3 wrestlemanias in a row, reigns is something else🙊
The tribal chief 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 won
I’m no longer watching wwe, I’m heading to AEW…this thing of Roman cheating to retain makes him a fake champion 🙄
Roman is rock❤🎉
The only reason roman won is because Vince got his way now that he's back. Cody shouldn't have lost, that actually stole this from being one of the best WM's of all time
WWE. DEBERIA DE QUITAR LOS CINTURONES A ROMAN  R. Y PORQUE.  BUENO AHÍ ESTUVO  METIDO  SOLO SIKOA, Y EL DECREPITO  PAUL H. (ROMAN)  SI PERDIOP LA LUCHA. VEAN  EL VIDEO. TODO TUVO SUCIO RARCEP GAYMART ARABE JESUITA
Jump over the head of the Roman Ring Spear .😮😮😂
Roman Reings will never lost the titles.
ACKNOWLEDGE HIM 🫡
Cody actually lost. Wow
That was the best 😂👍🏻
Would not be surprised if the boos and jeers at Roman Reigns will be way louder than the RAW after Mania 33 if he shows up tomorrow. 🤔
Royal rumble winner wasted, money in the bank winner wasted, i would have been happy if roman would have won the match without the help of bloodline
Just as I was getting back into watching wwe they had to ruin it
Cody will be champ but the only person to end this whole bloodline story is the same person that started it and that's Jey Uso
Roman Reigns' theme  is so thrilling 🔥
So, that’s it. WWE is dead.
Oh well bray wyatt is next
In order for Roman reign to lose his title, the champion match should be in a cell match, then no one can interfere.
How i wish cody could win
This was terrible. So many near falls and time spent not believing they kicked out is so dumb, and this was Cody’s time! Roman needs to loose the title so they can have 2 champions again
…and STILL! Tribal Chief entering 1,000 days as champion.
Who will finally beat this dude I will like to know?????
He was afraid of what he saw. These 2 days could not have been better.
Hahaha good plan.. The fans FEDUP that wwe always make roman win while cody can win hahaha but its okay entertainment right 🤣
Disappointing finish aside, this match itself wasn't even that good.
In the end, it became WrestleGAYnia.  I’ll bet all the “Woke” fans are happy, like the Casuals they all are.
Ahh...come on...this result very very SUCK
1000 days of Reigns🐐
Unreal. Cody had been pushed to the moon only for a LOSS?!?!?!
Now we’re sure, Vince is back…
We the One☝
WE WANT CODY AS CHAMPION
Ma perché cazzo non avete fatto vince lui dico io, una cosa dovevate fare per forza in questa seconda giornata di WM e non l'avete fatta. Era il momento di Cody e non glielo avete concesso, per far vincere sempre sto cazzo di Roman Reigns.
Who supports Roman ❤.
One of THE absolute best main events at WrestleMania in years. No cap. Should've been Cody's time already. WWE better make it up to the fans somehow.
Roman muss mal langsam die Titel verlieren, weil das schon mehr als langweilig zu sehen ist und Cody hätte die Titel mehr als verdient
I say boo have the titles change wrestling is boring with the same champion
Nothing ever changes WWE! Keep MF’s as the same champions!!
Now it's time for the triple threat at backladh
I had a feeling Roman was going to win! Just when fans thought they knew what was going to happen, the WWE pulls the chair from beneath you 😂
i told ya all of the World that the Tribal Chief emerged victorious(and still the wwe champion) over the American Nightmare! now acknowledge him...  he is the guy! his yard... his island, he is WWE!  -thank you paul heyman, and the members of the bloodline as well, you help him win lol-
Triple H : Here’s your Receipt for the throne
I knew it
Theory: The story is not yet finished. At Backlash, there would be a main event match between the Bloodline, and KO, Zayn, Rhodes... and the returning Randy Orton.  I really hope this would go on! And once Reigns had surpassed 1000+ days of his reign, Cody will successfully dethrone the Head of the Table!
Roman for the win let's go ❤
He will win it just be patient i have faith on HHH
MI JEFE TRIBAAAL ☝️👑
I told you, Cody would never beat Roman.
Roman reigns is not good enough than cody. .roman always cheat. .
Ich schau kein wwe mehr ist zum kotzn echt
I LOVED
Roman  🔥🔥🔥😱😱
Triple H and leaders who ruined that good narrative and good first day WrestleMenia at once are amazing..
Wwe is getting to obvious.
i'm trusting the process on this booking for now. but if the bloodline storyline goes stale or jumps the shark, this mania will be a gigantic what if
Oh the AEW Cody haters are having a field day now.
all for a stupid record
Roman is a poormans Wade Barret
he has made the whole thing laughable
Why are people surprised this was and still is the best storyline that I have seen since I was a kid and in my early teenage years as well. I will say this, it would have made more sense for Roman to lose the title and for the Usos to retain because then it could have made tension in the faction because he didn't have any gold but the Usos would have. Maybe they could have started thinking that they got as much stroke as Roman?  Now that i think more about It, i think they might have played this really wrong but we'll see cause they're not dropping this storyline for a while. It's money with the bloodline and they ain't done milking it for all they can.
So, how many matches would roman have won on his own in this title run. Surely the fact he has to keep relying on hey an, sakola and usos, must undermine his legacy. Maybe he would get more respect and acknowledgement from other wrestlers if he would fight fair.
Its still romans time 😂
And still the undisputed universal heavyweight champion of the world..   PAUL HEYMANNN 😂   Does Roman rent them titles from heyman or what? He’s never got them on him the wise man has managed to trick a tribal chief.
Where  can  i  see  full  match
Nah. This is bullsht. He had the perfect story and journey. Hope he gets what he deserves at Backlash.
AcknowledgeMe☝️☝️❤
Even if Rock returns i wouldn’t be excited now. WWE you sucks
I really really really thought cody was going to win.
But he’s the only undisputed champion in the bloodline
Dumbest end to wrestlemania ever. What was the point of all this hype if it's just going to end the same way almost all of reigns title defenses end? Bloodline gets involved and he retains. What was the point of all of this
That chapter is done ...cody is still another shot again no doubt
Cody’s face expressions during his entrance gave away the finish for me 😂💯
So when is j gonna win it its about time
Still Suck
0:20 chills ❤️❤️
Was there live.....the crowd was not happy with that finish
did Roman have to win
Wwe needs to stop pushing Roman
After watching the way Cody was doing Roman made me realize there's no way in hell Roman would be able to keep up with okada at all.
That vanilla midget jobber lost. Unlucky smarks try not to cry
Roman just had he’s bloodline to help him win
Cody didn’t win because it was too expected.
Maybe the plan is to split the titles 1st
ALL THAT BUILD UP. Just to give the win to the teachers pet.. ☠️
이게 맞냐 씨발
The boring Reigns ist still Champ and WWE lost a many network Users this. NIGHT. Believe me, that is the END.
It was Cody’s night
Ah the moment when usos lost their undisputed tag team.. Is this the sign that they will get em back the titles?
I think Roman won because they are going to split the titles and I think Cody is going to take the wwe title away from him at the next ppv instead of both
Cody should have won.  Edit: I take everything back. The storyline is amazing as of right now.
Guess wwe to scared to give the titles away knowing they lose viewers. Not giving anyone a chance
Bad move honestly. Hopefully Cody doesn't drop down the card
*yawn*...........................      it will never be the same... time to let go of wrestling
Oh and just make someone else win or no one will watch just let cody or a legend to return and win it
Please. go. away. Please. GO. AWAY.
Roman is my hero. Cody’s time will come. Brilliant match!
Hat der Roman wieder gewonnen oh man
I think it’s cause the usos lost fr fr so they had to make it so one keeps it i guess Roman brings to much attention to the company and money and media attention I doubt he loses that any time soon as much as I would like someone else to have a chance it is what it  is fr fr .
Roman won the match
Cody sucks Cody sucks Cody sucks Cody sucks
Good job Roman.
Roman still reigns ☝🏽
🐮💩
YES YES YES YES YES YES ROMAN REIGNS WINSSSSSSSSS
Such a disappointing experience again, because Roman doesn't fight fair, he's always helped by the other 3 members, how much longer do we have to watch this silly match ???
It's not highligh... We see nothing of the match
To be fair Cody disrespected the company, they're not just gonna handed him everything, you have to wait to see it played out...
It was cool being there. Ending sucked tho.
Who's next ?
Whenever I clicked on this video I really thought Cody was going to win but he lost😢😢😢😢
Vince is back in creative.that id the only explanation I have
i know we all cant believe Cody lost. But my god I cant believe we have at least another year with no titles every week and same damn 5 main events with Roman for the entire year. It's getting so stale even as a big Roman fan.
So disappointed by this match. I don't get this decision for the ending. I have no desire to watch raw tomorrow. Maybe I need a break from wwe for a while. Summer is coming, baseball is here. Let me know when the belts off Roman...
I knew my tribal chief wouldn't lose tonight
This was Cody’s time, Cody’s moment…this man was hyped up for a month and some change only for WWE creative to drop the damn ball!! Don’t get me wrong I respect and acknowledge Reigns (pun intended 🤣) but this was the perfect time to drop the belts to Cody and they blew it. The best moment to understand that was Roman’s outro @ 6:30 not a single pop compared to the begin of both competitors entrances. All the energy was sucked out and that kills me cuz Wrestlemania 39 was one of best ones in the past fews years (in my opinion) and this decision just left a bad taste.
They just sting Cody wtf bs wwe
i wish we could’ve just had a normal match where the best man wins but nope. i can’t imagine paying all that money to be there and seeing this BS
I think we can all agree we’re tired of Roman Reigns as champ
The wasted time is a pity. the 2,000,000 day reign of Romana
Ignorant fans and little kiddies crying. Roman Reigns winning is the best decision. Thank you Wwe. Cody ain't that guy. The longest reign deserves to be broken by him. Don't like it, don't watch. That's what I did when Brock was champ. It's not hard. Just do something else. Don't have to complain every time he wins and say the same thing over and over. Wah wah wah. You got your crackhead tag team champions now, but none of the roster at this point can light a candle to what Reigns has been doing. DEAL WITH IT. They broke the streak at Mania. Yall said streaks were meant to be broke. Keep that same energy.
Well this makes zero sense, all signs pointed to Cody winning. 🫤
well, I am not surprised I seen it coming....I guess CODY will never be a WWE Heavy Weight Champion....They going to keep him down...it's sad really....
man, I'm sick of roman reigns cheating.
Back to the Stardust treatment, I guess... 😏
☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️
Wwe now sucks because Roman wins everything my gosh even a dog does better directing and your losing people
YOUR KING..MY KING..ROMAN REIGNS
Captain America vs White Wolf Superman vs Aquaman
so happy roman won by far my favorite
Roman always cheats
Roman gonna break bruno summatrio record ❤🔥
Man, the cheating every match is getting boring
What a wrong call
He deserves a rematch at backlash
El jefe tribal☝️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Fuxxing game.
Hope Cody will end it at summerslam
It's not over for Cody we just getting started
We the ones
worst match ever
Roman Sucks
This is one of the biggest upset IMO. I wanted so badly to see Cody winning the Undisputed Champion. The hype was crazy.
It was a good match, but with the same ending shoved in our faces over and over. I think I would have prepared a clean win. M even though I supported Cody.
As much as it would've been a crowning moment for Cody to win at Wrestlemania, I feel like Roman still retaining was the right call. Storyline wise, Cody could use more "struggles" & it honestly doesn't make sense for a dominant faction over 2yrs+ to end just because of a Cinderella story in Cody Rhodes.  I think if Cody won now, yes it would've been a massive pop, but I think fans will turn on him quickly because he will represent a generic babyface character😅 He should still be in chase mode because fans love an underdog & it gives his character more credibility as someone who lost but still tried again. The only letdown is that when Cody does win the titles, the crowd won't be as special as a WM one..excited for RAW tom!
Vince booking
Nah spoiler 😢 we should watch full match not spoil the event 😢
Should have never left AEW 😞
2nd best Cody match / 2nd worst finish besides Undertaker Vs brock
Tomorrow night on raw all hell gonna break lose with Cody Rhodes with Roman reigns with a massive brawl
I kinda wish Cody would go back to one of his former roles, like Dashing Cody Rhodes, or Stardust. That was him in his element.
It was Cody's night I really wanted him to win but instead roman won again with cheating that is not a champion but I hope they do a rematch on summerslam hell in a cell match
Don’t kill me guys I’m just not motivated to see Cody as the champion yet personally I would love to see a wild card like Seth Rollins who knows Roman take the titles off his hand but I do feel like Cody is going to grow from this wait until Summerslam they gon let him take both of the titles from Roman
I love the tears for cody in the chat lol y'all just acknowledge the tribal chief ☝🏾
ACKNOWLEDGE HIM YOU PEASENTS... ACKNOWLEDGE HIM!
This is the saddest wm by far. Officially, Roman is protected.
☝🏽
☝🏽
Shocked that he won but being this close to a 1000 days makes me think they are holding off. That said the win not coming at mania will not be the same.
☝🏽
Had Cheated 😂
Cody fans, just cry one more year, while the tribal Chief destroy everyone.
TOLD YOU I told everyone that reigns will retain remember triple h might be in charge but Vince calls the shots in the dark bet after the whole Cody starts aew do you really think Vince wants a guy who started the competition to win his title nope
History repeats itself like in 2000 it was triple h's domination now its roman riegns (If you know you know)
Honestly destroyed the good faith anyone had in WWE Awful decision, HHH has lost all credibility
VINCE IS JUST RUBBISH
It would have been PERFECT
Cody's redemption storyline is going to be so lit. I fully predict he will win it at SummerSlam. I'm happy Roman gets to reach 1k though.
Well, now we're in uncharted territory, and that's kinda exciting. At the same time, I too feel like this was a perfect time for a new champion.
Let Cody have a rematch at backlash
Roman still won ,lol Jesus,  good cause Rhodes is soft
I wonder what will Roman Regins do to the Usos when they lost their Titles
Tired of Roman being champion.. was very heartbroken that Cody didn't win.. I definitely hope he gets another chance at summer slam and wins.. Tired of not having the champion on raw and smackdown.. disappointed
You all robbed Cody Rhodes.
Tbf this makes sense. I think this is where we start to see the end of the bloodline and it will probably have something to do with jey imo
Cody's jackets are so cool!
I quit watching WWE it's total scripted shiet 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕 Cody deserved the win.
ima take that from you    !!!!
So many people complaining about Cody losing. The way I see it, either man winning this match would be fine. Now the bloodline story continues which is a win. Only part I have a problem with is why did Cody break solo’s streak just to have him lose at mania? That part doesn’t make sense to me at this point but I trust they can make it all make sense over the next couple months
Roman's title reign has been boring since it got unified
Whaaaat? WWE being scared of change and protecting a stale commodity? Who could have guessed.  You had all the momentum, the time was right, and they pussied out. Guess we get another year of Roman, but my enthusiasm is out the window. I'll check in next WrestleMania.
Wow what a huge mistake to not build on the momentum that is Cody Rhodes
Very Interesting
Roman reigns time is running out something is wrong they are making him a legend soon he won't be wrestling.
So cody didn't win the title at all dang
I knew it i know the usos is gonna help roman reigns
WWE knew we were anticipating a cody win. All the matches seemed predictable. Only 2 wrong predictions. Edge winning and roman winning.
Cody just got Luger'd Their pettiness knows no bounds.
ROMAN WITH 1000 DAYS RECORD
booring roman always win like that
How original
Triple H's Biggest mistake
I refuse to watch WWE until roman reigns loses the titles boycott starts now
Yes roman love youuuuuu
What a bs show...Cody should've win
Back to the mid card 😂
Blame the neck tattoo.
Bro how the hell did Cody lose?? Another year of Roman reigns being champion lol it’s getting boring 😂😂
Thank you for the terrible ending of the show. I think in my old age I will watch WWE. and the 19909 day of Rein Romana will pass. God bless wwe
They buried Cody... WWE never changes.
Cody kinda looks like Homelander 😂
😂😂y’all thought stardust was dethroning the head of the table?
i tell before match if roman retains title, i never watch WWE again, so goodbye wwe viewers, it was a beautiful 15 years story :(
Der Wahre Sieger ist Cody.
I don't know the rules of this game, but I think Roman is the organization's favorite. every time he faces an anniversary the height gains thanks to the intervention of the Usos. it was like that against Edge, Seth Franklin, Zamy, etc.
Y’all really thought the bloodline was going to go out like that? First Solo first loss on Friday, Usos dropping the titles on Sat & y’all expected Roman to drop on Sunday too 😂😂😂
I’m glad my guy won that’s all that matters
You got to respect greatness, acknowledge him and your tribal chief Roman reigns!
Is wwe going to do right Monday night? Or is Vince McMahon really in control!!!! All women tune out tomorrow!!!!!
Negative one in attendance awesome
You figure after Sami and KO would come in and do this to Roman… he would lose but that Tribal Chief refuses to go down man! Geez!
Acknowledge him!! ☝🏽
Please rematch for Cody in a cell... without any aliens...❤😇 Cody you are the great one...we love you.. your time will come..❤❤❤😇
Of course they want reigns to have 1000 days again
They will boo the hell out of Roman RAW after WrestleMania 🤣
Bloodline 🗑️
Cody got SMASHED into Star DUST
I told y'all, WWE didn't build Roman Reigns over 3 years now just for some AEW reject to come back to WWE less than a year now and wants to defeat Reigns It won't happen Rather maybe Jey Uso or even Seth Rollins might be the best option to beat Roman
Lol come on roman was never losing 1000 days cry babies
So like build up for nothing? Night one was better imo besides the hiac but the finish was awful, finished like 90% of Roman’s wins, didn’t feel special or anything just rushed, kinda lame but oh well
Cody should've won all the Roman matches end the same they're starting to blur together never the less good match and a hell of a weekend of wrestling
Seemed like a big miss for wwe. It won't mean as much for cody as it would have tonight.  Cody wont be as hot as he was tonight either. Never seen such angry fans after this one. But WWE really want those 1000 day shirts i guess.
Same old Roman and the bloodline, always cheating. Reigns can never win without interference. He can never retain without help ever.
Cody should’ve won last night that’s all I’m saying building him up for Wrestlemania then lose at Wrestlemania that’s not right
He headlines every wrestlemania. WWE is messing things up with him still being champion
To those of you who are DISAPPOINTED with the end result, please exercise more patience and follow along with the story. THIS WAS AN INCREDIBLE MATCH! EXTREMELY PROUD OF CODY RHODES!!!
I guess Cody stopped Solo Sikowa's undefeated streak so Solo felt justified to end Cody's. What a class act Cody Rhodes is. Much respect to him.
I just don't get why it ended this way.  Usos lost the titles, and Roman couldn't defeat Cody without constant interference from 3 people, and Cody, even after the Zayn vs Roman match, was still extremely over.  All this did was hurt everyone involved in terms of storyline.  Not even Roman winning that bothers me, just that what seemed to be the ending to one of the most interesting stories they have ever come up with just was a ref bump and interference ending.  Something just urks me about it and not in a good way, ending just felt really lazy and rushed.
WWE really wasted Cody’s moment all for stat padding. You could’ve made a MEGA STAR
See I told you Roman reigns would win
Smh tht how u know Vince back in creative
Je suis vraiment peiné pour cody c’était le bon endroit, le bon moment même si il gagne à backlash ça n’aura plus la même saveur
People who are complaining are the same people who were gon turn on Cody 3months after the win
Real winner is Cody... please rematch in sell...
This was some Vince McMahon story telling if I have ever seen it… whack. Cody should of won.
Did you really think they'd have The Bloodline lose every title at one event and kill the hottest storyline wrestling has had in years? Not a chance, especially with the company for sale. No one is buying Cody long-term. He's a transitional champion at best, and that transition is months away. No matter what happens the rest of this year, Gunther will be crowned the next long-term champion at WM 40, and don't be surprised when he has Paul Heyman in his corner as his advocate after Heyman abandons Roman later this year when The Bloodline falls apart...
honestly it is getting boring seeing him win over and over again
Why wwe why you could have had two stars the loss would have done nothing to Roman
why roman why roman why roman
This is absolute nonsense. I have no idea why they are billing reigns as unbeatable its becoming irritating to watch
Cody Rhoades dream shattered...😂🤣😥❤❤❤☝️
he didnt deserved to win
Roman Reign's kick out at 2.999 is very OP
The hype him up just to lose this is stupid. Very bad decision here everyone is bored of Roman enough
Roman is a spoiled part timer whose handed everything for being related to the rock
WWE Don't make me watch AEW Cody Rhodes Time was now there Betta be a rematch
He’s a chicken we love when he was big we don’t want the tribal chief and the stupid acknowledgment
Wore than a chorus of boos... crickets.
Ending was L. not even a clean win smh
Dropped the ball on this one, you won't have a better setting then this to switch champions. Now you've made every outcome obvious as your going to try, and push Roman to have the longest title run.
I think this is for the best, if I'm being honest.   Hear me out Roman's Title reign is gonna be over 1,315 days next mania and if you have cody beat roman and end his title reigns then, I think that would give Cody a massive moment and give him a really meaningful championship victory.  Also next year is Wrestlemania 40 which is WAY more important than this years especially being a anniversary Mania.
4:27 the Randy Orton Slam too.
Tricherie
Why do they only show that? and they do not show when Roman crushed Cody, when Cody was the victim of the spear or the brutal guillotine, I only see the moments when Roman is hit, it is as if Roman did nothing and then he won. I don't understand 🤨
I'm done with wrestling smh, until roman gets beaten
I can't believe people are complaining, this was the most fun I've had watching a wrestling event since I was a kid... thought it was an awesome show!
It was really obvious, but man I really wanted to be proved wrong yet WWE went with the predictable script.
Wwe failed this time really hard
Why oh why doesn't the ref ban people from interfering in the match I want to see Cody Rhodes Vs Roman Reigns Rematch and I hope to god that Paul heyman Jimmy USO jey USO and solo sacoa and Kevin owens and sami zayne are banned from ring side so that Cody and Roman can have a fair rematch
AND STILL THE UNDISPUTED WWE UNIVERSAL CHAMPION!!!
Booshit 😂
He is the one the legend Roman Reigns 👆👆
Cody Rhodes ⭐
I’m done bro
not the finish we expected
Roman is the greatest of all time
Am glad Roman returned he has been to strong to lose to Cody let Randy return and win
Roman is bad reslar
Awesome ! Reigns still the champ
When Cody was sitting next to HHH at the HOF he must’ve ask him if he could use his pedigree finisher lol, but for real, this was bad booking, Cody losing to outside interference
Looks like another year of Roman. I don't know when Roman will lose. At least he'll get his 1000 day reign?
its gonna be interesting if they bring CM PUNK for the next Wrestlemania so Roman would be ultimately defeated once and for all
WWE missed a golden opportunity to have the greatest feel good moment in WrestleMania history, but nope instead were going to keep the belt on Roman. Look, no one is ever going to surpass Bruno Sanmartino, it just isnt going to happen, and they should stop play acting like it might. The reason the Attitude Era was so good was because the belt could change hands at any time. Everyone who isn't a Roman fan is sick to death of seeing him hold the belts, 900+ days, give us an effing break already, its stale and boring. You had the son of Dusty Rhodes, on the greatest stage of them all, and you instead just screw Cody over, you didn't make Roman look strong, you made him look like a punk who can't fight his own battles.   Even if they give the belt to Cody tomorrow on Raw or at the next PPV, its not the same and WWE creative screwed up royally. I was starting to get back into it, but you lost me again. This was a stupid call.
Cody will take revenge
I bet everyone was just as shocked as Cena losing to theory... Cody really deserves the titles from seeing his glow-up-return and undefeated streak. Like if u agree...
Why do we have to keep seeing part-timer champion??😢
Vince and Triple H didn’t want the AEW guy winning at Wrestlemania. Utterly disappointing finish. They lost millions of viewers with this brainfart decision to let Roman beat Cody.
I think reigns will lost this title reign at w40
Don't care about the future This was cody's wrestlemania moment, it could've been the best mania since WM30
Where's the dislike button when you need it!
Storys have more than one chapter
Wwe doesn't have the balls to go with Cody. The most disappointing finish on WM ever.
thanks wwe for flipping the script like dumb and dumber from game of thrones, this is the worst endig to a great storyline...i quit
Toilet Champs,can not win w/out help hehehe!!!!!
I think I am the only one who is happy Roman Reigns won.👍🏻😁☝🏻
They should've put the titles on Cody
What a bum, Cody should have won.
There's always Backlash.
"Tribal Chief, You Are The WrestleMania" Paul Heyman - 2023
sami and ko didn't making and better jump cody matches I hope somebody else take they titles away from them real soon
If Cody wins the championship on Raw after wrestlemania I'm going to be so pissed but so happy aswell cuz he won
The usos should get a mach at raw vs sami and ko pls
Worst Finish in Wrestling History
Dissapointing another year of only one major title and lots of PPV with 0 Major titles defences... WWe's obsession to put Roman Reigns over is just too much at this point..
1:20 His daughter’s blue eyes 🥹
Even though the stage was set for Cody this time. next time he will win it will it be as special as this moment, no but WWE always messing up we all should use to it at this point
Getting the tribal chump to 1000 days is obviously more important, when that happens will never hear the end of it from Cole
Cody out
Storyline wise it makes sense for Roman to retain, The fall of the bloodline can't just happen in two nights. From here to summerslam I think the Usos will probably see that Roman is using them for his benefit that's how the bloodline will disintegrate. Cody will probably get his moment at Summerslam i think.
CODY RHODES ACKNOWLEGE ME ☝
Can’t y’all be happy for Roman he fought during leukemia for 11 years he deserves this 😢
My goodness nobody defeat or beat the tribal Chief what's going on here
Great decision to let Roman to retain the titles Cody not ready
Story wise cody should of won but after that there's know one else that's up with these two as popularity
WWE Hollywood screwjob. Yeah I said it
You guys screwed this one up.
Romen is KING👑
When is this nightmare gonna end
They want Reigns to reach the 1000 days mark as champion, because that’s when the next PPV is right? Or at least a PPV is on that day. It would be a perfect way to end his reign
Randy Orton is next..
I’ve never been so sad in my life I can’t explain how tired I am of seeing Roman holding the belts
Man that's some BS. Cody Rhodes should have won.
Roman will now be mad at the Usos for loosing their belts 😢😢
👎👎
Roman has been pushed so hard since 2015 hasn’t been pinned since 2019 been champ since 2020 had both titles for a year shows up twice every 4 months to say acknowledge me
Prime example of how incompetent booking can turn an on paper great match, into a very hated one.
Road to 1000 day acknowledge tribal chief
Ban WWE
Great match, solid story, terrible ending. Just like his dad, the company he works for screwed him out of the gold.
I wanted Cody, but going I said I wasn’t going to be if Roman won ON THE STRICT CONDITION that he surpasses 1,000 days. I’ll take it
Backlash
I'm to see everyone cry about cody
I don't think WWE know how much it hurt to see Cody lost that match he should have won and it broke my heart that he didn't I actually cry
I bet all my money in my bank account right now evert single last penny nickel and dime that roman is officially losing at summer slam
🤮 siempre es lo mismo. Aburre
Why main event wrestlemania  just to lose?
If not Cody than i don't know who's gonna dethrone him
This is so flat had to understand this booking was it Vince?
The history of this company going out their way to embarrass the Rhodes Family continues. I don’t care if they let Cody win tomorrow.. RAW is not Wrestlemania and it does not give him back his moment.
We would be sad if Roman Reigns didn't succeed
Oh dear how sad never mind
And we STILL have to acknowledge the CHIEF ... A battle for the ages ... Cody fought well, but the chief always had backup ... 10/10 for this match Roman and Cody NEVER disappoint
Is it just me or will Cody win it at wrestmania backlash
I can't believe that Roman Reigns defeated Cody Rhodes and is still the champion it is all because of Paul Heyman and Solo Sikoa. Right now I am not in a mood. I hope Cody Rhodes will get a rematch at Backlash or I don't know when. 😢😢😢😢😢
We the ones☝️☝️☝️
I wanted Cody Rhodes to win I thought I would win, but I'm so disappointed. Korean fans are very angry Did the local fans also want Cody Rhodes to win?
way too crush everyone’s happiness 😂
BOOOOOO👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾🍅🍅🍅
I’m glad that Roman won because then the bloodline wouldn’t be as good.
Its a new Story of Roman reigns.
Adrenaline, in my soul. They just ruined cody rhodes
wrestlemania day 2 against the first complete disappointment. You are fed up with Roman Reign
Cody's fav movie was empire's strikes back. The ending of this match definitely felt like the siths won.
Instead of doing this ☝️ Everyone should do this 🖕
Another year of Roman.... Don't get me wrong Roman is Great and the story that they have done is Phenomenal but hes reign is too long.. Share the Limelight to other please
the wwe Roman guy won again by cheating
I guess that’s what you get for smashing HHH’s throne on AEW PPV.
night 2 feels like vince’s booking…
Things we can learn a) Roman will be champion for 200 years without ever defending his title by himself b) Cody will be buried beyond burying c) WWE doesn't really care about its fans.
My Tribal Chief ¡I Acknowledge You! ☝🏻🙇🏻‍♂️ ¡Believe That! ¡1000 days! 👑👑
'Go away heat' coming next
,☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️ Aknowledge
Cody should have won just show you roman is cheating champion well done roman 👏 😂
70/80% believed Cody would win.  Sucks to be you.
Acknowledge him ☝🏾
Cody really has wonderful performance And yep...Roman cheat to win again. Anyway well done for both of them  And well done to the scriptwriters 💀
although I wanted cody to win big props to both for this performance tonight!
Oh my god Roman Reigns is spoiled WWE
Good to see WWE is staying true to form and refusing to build new stars.
yes I glad Roman reigns  wins the ones
Roman is not #1 he a soft puppy
WWE messed up letting Roman win here. Everything was perfect for Cody to win. Who cares if it was predictable? The stage was set perfectly. Have fun one upping this one.
Is not easy to put the tribal chief down
dislike
Great the part timer that wrestles 4 times a year continues to hold both brand titles
Woah Oh
One of the greatest Wrestlemania we had in how many years, but the ending made the fans really dissapointed.👀
I said it before roman he's in his prime time
Roman Reigns can't win alone. That's the reality hidden by WWE.
Just halfass getting back into wrestling entertainment, and it may not last long. Roman R is pretty boring the last few big matches I’ve seen of his. I at least appreciate C’s pedigree and thought that’d have been a cool story line. Even though I’m not all too enamored w/Cody. But at least was an Okay match…
l honestly getting fade up with Roman Reigns.....Cody should have won...its becoming boring now...l prsonally feel like things should change now....l hate it now
Tribal chief is the one acknowledge tribal chief
I wonder who's going to break the winning streak of Roman..
If only we could see the like and dislike bar.
Its sooooo near yet so far for Cody. But its ok. He will get there. ❤
Michael Cole is no tony shavoni
0:20 is so fire
Rất hay 🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🤚🤚
Clash at the Castle 2 😂
Such a bad choice
Roman reigns deserves the win, he has fought a lot of great personalities that outshine Cody (no offense) so losing title just like that makes no sense
Big miss by WWE. Big L
i almost i don't watch on wwe when roman lost but he won ... so i still watch on wwe.
Boring is boring to WWE
Roman Reigns entrance was fking amazing...the final boss with piano music to accompany him😮
Ya en verdad ya uno sta harto de román reing como campeón siempre disque aparece alguien a sarvarlo
Acknowledge Your Tribal Chief ☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽
Cody is going to go spiraling down mid-card hellhole or will turn heel
stupid wwe
I litterly hate HHH h he’s always doesn’t want know one to win the universal championship this is why fans have stopped watching wwe 😡
All of u haters 😂😂 Cry Smoking that opp pack
They want Roman to surpass 1000 which I understand so he will list likely lose after that!!!
Big fan of both but I knew Roman would win
Roman is Soft he can’t beat Cody without his family someone need to handle solo nvm I can beat solo myself wanted to cheat for Roman I can even the odds Cody need a rematch to beat Roman
Cody will win at SummerSlam for sure. Now, with only Roman as a Champion, the bloodline will end and cody's moment Will be pure satisfaction.
I really hope Cody and Reigns have another championship match. This one should not have ended the way it did. It was Cody's time. I really hope they have a match at Backlash.
I’m done watching wwe.
I am saddened by the loss of Cody Rhodes. He would prefer to be given another chance at the WWE title, just so that the titles are dismantled and the oppressed wrestlers get their rights.
SCHIFO
Wrong winner. Simple as that.
I guess they want Jey to end the Reigns
So who beats Roman a 50 year old Rock? The whole roster has been ran through by Roman. That’s wild crazy. Even if Cody wins at summerslam the win won’t hit the same.
No happy ending 😂😂😂
SUMMERSLAM 2021 WAS THE LAST TIME ROMAN REIGNS WON A MATCH CLEAN....I'M DONE WITH THIS!!!
Reigns did not deserve to win, he clearly cheated by having Heyman distract the ref right when Solo illegally attacked Rhodes for like the second or third time.
Well see what happens at raw this week saying they could get a rematch our some reinforcements
Cody deserved better 😂
So it comes to this: He will not finish the story
Genuinely have no idea who beats Roman now, was certain they’d pull the trigger with Cody 🤯
No one can’t not defeat, Roman reigns he’s gonna pass Bruno Sammartino’s record now.
Roman Reigns somehow managed to keep the fate of The Bloodline intact despite losing the undisputed tag team championships to K.O and Sami Zayn.
Very disappointing,  Roman needs help all the time in order to win 🙄
The most deflating ending. There's not going to be another ready made challenger to take it on and win properly. And even if Cody does win it later on it won't have as much meaning to it. He legit should have stayed in AEW at this point.
Todos sabemos que ya tenía que perder, basura, la cargaron en lo más importante
Romans gonna end up loosing his titles in the stupidest way possible watch. What else is there for him to do . If he loses to an old timer coming back like Goldberg WWE would ruin their biggest story line they've had in the past decade
Wwe is a joke now
Reigns is old news. Bad decision to let him win.
wm 39 isn't bad, it's still very entertaining👌
Vince Mcmahon last minutes comeback😂😂😂
Roman's gimmick will never be able to hold together without titles, Cody is the true champion! ACKNOWLEDGE CODY ROADS!
So who’s actually gonna beat Roman now
Yessiiirr big roman big dog big head of the table big tribal chief!!! Stop betting against this man
lol, people be angry again. Although, when someone does defeat Reigns, it is gonna be one hell of a defeat for him.
I hate that Cody lost, but along as he gets world title reign I'm good, also y'all right in comments saying Cody winning anywhere else will have less hype 😫😫
So who’s actually gonna beat Roman now
Whack. Not the Match, the result.
Isn't it time Roman lost already? They ruined Cody's huge moment just for Roman to reach a 1000 days. Smh
The way Cody imbraced his family at the beginning told me.  He could have done that after if he was going to win.  They still told a great story in the match though
It's not Wrestlemania the best time to end reigns of Roman, It's Summerslam bruhh.
Cody is a legend… but bray is the chosen one to defeat Roman
What Roman reigns again, not worth watching WWE anymore, same stupid champion again! Boring!!!!!!!!
Congratulations to Roman Reigns, Wrestling Champion, he deserves to win
i wish Cody Rhodes vs Gunther in the Intercontinental Title Match happened. Even though Cody should return to  aew and win more belts rather than in wwe.
Sometimes the right thing is the predictable thing.
As much as I love Cody if you were gonna put Roman over should’ve just had cody and Sami final 2. Have Sami win the rumble then he can lose at Wm tbh. Because even though I wanted Sami to win the rumble I didn’t mind cody because I thought he’d beat Roman.
Mengecewakan
WWE got over on us everyone was waiting for Cody to win 😂
Last person can defeat reigns are like Chris jericho Dean ambrose (jon moxley) Drew mcintyre (without sikoa) Cody (without sikoa)
We the ones ☝️ always the bloodline
Super Reigns... 🤬🤮🤮🤮🤬🤮🤮🤬🤬🤬🤮🤮🤮🤮🤬🤬🤬🤮🤮🤮🤬🤬
Roman punishes the Usos for losing, they end up costing him the belts at SummerSlam to Cody/Seth.   There’s your spoiler.
The truth Roman deserved to win the title,we can't imagine Roman reigns without a title, they should have fought for 1 title and Cody wins the title
I'm just pissed at WWE program and booking, it got so boring seeing roman as champion, he isn't even a classic heal in my opinion. Just boring to see him get win after win no matter how good or charismatic his opponent is.
Repetitive, boring ... The matches are well organized, good fights, decent stories but damn, theese World titles means absolutely nothing theese days. Hope they will just quit at the Raw brand, it's useless anyway to try to carry a brand with Theory, Bobby who, and Rollins+Lesnar cameos.
The ending of this match proves that not every story has a happy ending
one of the best WrestleMania main events ever. happy Roman retained but this absolutely was the right time to drop it
He had no right to this ‘moment’ that everyone is crying about. He’s not done anything in his return to WWE for a start, remember that.
So many of the wrong people won at night 2. Cody should’ve won, demon should’ve won he could’ve had a small streak at mania could’ve been the closest to taker at mania. Askua should’ve won. Im genuinely only happy about Gunther’s win because I wanna see him break honkys record. Im just so heart broken Cody lost that was the place to do it now what I’m afraid the next it’s not gonna be as impactful. I can’t rn I’m too sad 😭. And this the first ever wrestlmania I I ever watched not even joking.
Cody had the win if the bloodline wasn’t there
It’s -1
Top 5 mania Imo. I'm not upset with this and I honestly was pulling for Cody not even gonna lie.  This seems like a long term story and classic rivalry in the making for these two. They didn't even physically fight until this match. No brawl or anything before this match. Amazing promos though! What Cody said can be the truth. Just not yet. The Usos lost their titles. That's the start. Roman can give them hell for some time causing them to eventually turn. Then solo himself even turns. The bloodline slowly crumbles and mania was just the start. Roman's gonna hit that 1000 mark though.
I’m tried of this Reign
Vince McMahon at backstage - 😂😂😂😂
Trash finish
Chody strong is best
เนื้อเรื่องแย่มาก มั่วสุดๆ
Nah am tired of this Roman story it's now becoming boring
Wwe might be planning jey uso to actually take the titles from roman at summerslam Cause this entire bloodline started with jey and jey is going to end it.
In my opinion, Cody's loss at Wrestlemania could be beneficial for him as it positions him as the face of the company. Fence sitters may now be more inclined to support him since the ending of the match made him appear as though he was robbed of his glory.   This could lead to a compelling storyline for WWE, with Cody as the protagonist who defeats the final boss, Reigns, at Summerslam. This would make the drama more personal between the two wrestlers and captivate the audience.
Should’ve been Cody who won the undisputed championship, but I think it’s too soon for Cody. Hopefully rematch in Backlash
Boring to WWE boring is bulshit roman win
I hope Cody win man what this ?
Terrible ending I’m sick of Roman keep winning it’s getting boring
they want to make a new cheater champion, but tribal cheat can't react to the level like HHH or Edge, at least Seth
I'm telling you all right now. For those saying Cody should've won. I'm not disputing that he had the moment and the story and the place. But not the time. Let Roman's reign surpass to a thousand days then let the man who helped start romans reign destroy it. JEY USO
Cody was completely robbed!
2nd best mania ever? 19 was the 2nd but I think this one was better
An amazing match. The Bloodline drama continues and so does Cody's struggle for the belt. Hopefully the following story and end will be amazing.  And I was fine with either guy winning, to be honest.
Roman win because of solo. This is handicap match 3 vs 4. 👎👎👎👎👎 Thanks to WWE , Roman can be champion 1000 day, 2000 day, or even 10 years. WWE have no world champion except Roman. 👎👎👎👎👎
Wwe is not real
Never been so bummed out to a loss since Jeff lost that Steel Cage match to CM Punk more than a decade ago lmao
You’re never getting a better moment to crown Cody than this. Whenever they choose to do it, it will have substantially less hype. Those who believe Cody needed this “hardship” from a storytelling perspective are seemingly choosing to forget this man left the company that made him and his comfortable pay for years, revolutionized the indies, was a founder of a wrestling promotion which is currently WWE’s biggest competitor, just to prove his worth and come back with leverage to WWE creative, the place where he wants to be to make his late father proud, what more hardship do you need?
I could tell Cody was kinda going to lose during his entrance, he didn't seem to have "IT". . He just looked a bit unhappy and not as hyped as he should been, especially when he went to see his daughter.. it felt more like "Im sorry, daddy isn't winning tonight but at least this is our moment you can look back to in 8 years"  I still thought he was going to win but looking back.. makes sense Not only did the finish suck but the main event sucked. The best part were the entrances
A shambles of an ending. Cody robbed
Could Gunther possibly be the one to dethrone Roman Reigns in a winner-take-all match?
엔간히해라 WWE~~~지겹다 언제가지 로만의 벨트를봐야하나
roman don't cheat u can won easily against cody rhodes 🥰🥰👍👍👍
damn
WORST ENDING
I don't know why they had Cody Rhodes Lose because of roman reigns Shouldn't have retain
If the stipulations is one of the belt, then Cody might win, but both belts...Cody is not really a best pick, or maybe we can say, no one can really handle 2 belts for now.  So the best outcome is still only make 2 person fight for 2 belt simultaneously, split up the belt is more important than dethrone him.  For people who really think Cody would win, yeah maybe he got that Star power on other brand, but in WWE, he is just fighting few matches, a short storyline, his own price are not even valuable than his Family name. Sami has set up for all this also unable to dethrone him, what makes u think Cody can? For current situation, I more prefer Jey or Sami dethrone him but not Cody.  Cody need a longer time and few more reasons (not just Family, it's his own) to dethrone a 1000 days reign. We will see what will happen in SummerSlam
There is not one person who can say they did not think Cody was going to win tonight. It was the perfect story and the perfect timing now if he wins it’s later on it won’t be as big. In my opinion WWE dropped the ball tonight
Triple H over Sting,  Roman over Cody…. I ACKNOWLEDGE VINCE MCMAHON! 🙌☝️🙌
The 🐐 rr
How was night one main event ending better than Night two
Let's face it, Roman Reigns had already held the championship for 945 days, and it looks like he is going to reach over 1000 days as champion so Roman Reigns is going to lose the title but not yet. The sun will soon set on his championship reign.
Now it's JEY USO's turn ☝️
A lot of people won’t like this,but hopefully this might lead up to a rematch next year,like John cena vs rock,John cena loses the first match but next year he gets the rematch and beat him.Hopefully this is the same situation with Cody,that’s when Roman will probably be alone this time.
This was the perfect match for Roman to lose his titles. There is no another best chance. Best only comes once.
This is the perfect time and place to end Roman Reigns Title Reign.Cody should've won,Roman is overrated now only win by cheating😪.L Triple H👎👎
Roman will probably drop it at summer slam or royal rumble
If solo would have stayed out of it he would have
I know this has nothing to do with this match but wish John won his match, I'm sure he would've if it wasn't for the title since John is busy with other stuff,  but this was still a good match
Worst creative decision since Katie vick
Dude I genuinely feel like roman should've stood up for body to Vince and dropped those titles 😢
You can look powerful in defeat but still 2 1/2 years is long enough to they should've ended the reign tonight with Cody
We RIOT
Cody Rhodes did all that hard work to lose. I’m still mad about that. 👎🏽👎🏽
Cody should have won and this is hands down the worst WrestleMania ever. Night one was 10 times better
Unless they’re planning for a wm 40 rematch, they really fumbled
I don’t acknowledge Roman because he always get help to finish the job . I don’t remember the last time he won on his own
Cody bringing back the winged eagle belt out the window lol
cody's moves reminds me of someone else yes the viper
Pretty sure we're gonna see Gunter and his Imperium against the Bloodline soon 🔥🔥🔥
Roman carried wwe for three years and is one of the factor why wwe is  relevant this 2023. We all know its Cody's time but give props to Roman and give him the thousand days cause hell never go a thousand again in his career.   Its also a good setup for the eventual dissolution of the bloodline. Who would be invested in the bloodline storyline without those belts.  Look at damage control, good team but with no belts its shaky of a storyline.
They really fuked Cody. Unbelievable!
Que asco el final de este combate 👎🤮🤮
☝🏿
solo robbed cody
Y’all should of had Jr & the king ringside
The only way the idiot can win
Cody left wwe went to aew he can’t come back nd expect to win the titles especially from Roman it’s a stretch that he won the rumble🤷🏽‍♂️
If Roman reigns doesn’t lose to Cody at wrestlemania then he will never lose. 😢😢😂
I know everyone upset but this is story building at its finest. Roman is Dusty Rhodes favorite Protégé Cody is Dusty favorite son. Cody has to earn it ,you can’t leave your home , comeback and skip the line he’s going to become the ULTIMATE UNDERDOG. But unlike dusty he will WIN!
Roman reigns You are wrestlemania great man! Cody rhodes you are looser wrestlemania! Go home aew!!!! Get out!!!
Cody should have taken it. Welcome back Vince.
Cody storyline shouldn't over like this. They still have to continue this storyline until it's proper climax. I bet they're not done yet with the feud
We the ones👆🏻
Cody Should’ve Won
Yes sir the Head of the table Roman Reigns retained his undisputed WWE Universal Championship against the American nightmare Cody Rhodes in a hell of a fight 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿☝🏿💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
What a horrible ending. WWE continuously pushing the same boring old story of having Roman win by cheating. At least have him win in convincing fashion instead of doing your repetitive old story of having his minions help him in every single title match. There’s literally no element of surprise anymore in the product. L WWE.
If Randy Orton  is supposed to be returning is the rumor it could Randy orton  become the undisputed champion
Predicted as always 🫥
I can't believe they robbed this man
I knew as soon as The Uso's lost, Reigns was retaining. It's a complete shame WWE threw away what possibly could of been Cody's biggest moment in his WWE career. I'm just disappointed that WWE is afraid of letting Roman lose one title and they decided to ruin Cody's big moment
Jey looks fat Or I have a problem with my eyes
Esse paul Herman não vale nada.
Cody should have won that match
Roman remains the weakest champion who can't win on his own.
Why trips y
Its the same match formula every match with Roman someone interferes or ref gets Knocked out. Dude can't win on his own its boring and stale asf just like his character
That finish sucked the energy right out of the building. Never heard that crowd so quiet.
Im done watching wwe
Vince is still in charge 😢
Cody got it, before he entered the federation for 2 years he talked all kinds of nonsense against them, interviews, invited guests and wrestlers to talk against them, and now suddenly he became a messiah and comes to save everyone, get in line and wait ....I'm glad how it turned out.
And the winner is Vince Macmahon's senile ego
the big woof woof won
Nathan Gois could have helped Roman Reigns
Roman Reigns is still your Undisputed WWE Universal Champion.
And let this be a lesson to you all Nobody defeats the Tribal Chief 1-vs-5
The people who wanted Cheeseball Cody to win with his Generic af nice guy cheesy routine are also the reason why we had PG Trash for a decade.
DONE WITH THIS COMPANY UNTIL ROMAN LOSES THE TITLES!
Cody, you need to return to AEW, WWE is burying you right now.
Bless our tribal chief
Everybody did doubt Roman so 🤷🏾‍♂️
Randy orton can beat roman reigns 🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥..
$uck roman i hate him do much wwe start be trash af
massive wasted opportunity with Cody, doesn’t matter if he wins next ppv, it won’t be nearly as significant as winning at Wrestlemania
5:30 messed up spot
Great to see stardust choking a golden opportunity. Guess he should have stayed in the Indy scene with those vanilla midgets at AEW
They blew it.  Plain and simple.
read the f'in room wwe, no one wanted this.
The story is not over yet
what the…..
Hahaha Seth is NEXT 😂
whose telling them that their editing is stupity
Wrong guy won
🙏💪💯🔥🇯🇲
I'm so happy Reigns won, could he have won in a better way, yess, but I'm so happy he retained, now we get to the 1k days
Cody Gonna Winning At Summerslam
Cody was sure to make this the most heartbreaking loss ever 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
This is why my kids don't watch wrestling anymore. Always someone jumping in. And never a legitimate champion.. Lol..
Sorry Mother Failures Usos
Nanalo sa kadayaan
Cody is American but Roman is his Nightmare 😂
Well I guess it's back to not watching wwe
This sucked man. It was the moment. For 3 years, almost every Roman match had the SAME ending. You passed on Sami just so you can build to this... stupid finish. Even if Cody wins on the next Raw, it would NEVER have the same significance.
Who win??🤨🧐🧐
Does Roman Reigns have a video of HHH peeing on a stripper ???
Night 2 full of wrong winners. Balor, Asuka and Cody Should won there Matches!
Now what??? It was about time for a change. Can't please everyone but it's okay. Don't have to continue watching.
I think Seth Rollins or Jey Uso might be the ones to end Roman's reign of terror
Imagine leaving AEW just to get buried 💀
CODY SHOULD HAVE WON!
Oh cmon
Did Vince book night 2?  Not mad at Roman winning, but what a chance to create an absolute top level talent that WWE creative just missed.
And solo I can’t wait till Cody hurts u
You guys FCKED it up!!
Putangina mo roman reigns humanda ka kay ben tulfo bukas sa monday night raw
Ok what most likely will happen in my eyes is. Solo gets a mid card title, the usos get the tag titles back. Cody Sami and Kevin find a 4th person and then it sets up a war games match for all the gold.
I'm getting tired of roman reigns
Not watching wrestling till Roman loses. Cody winning doesn't mean as much now when he wins. Roman will have it till Summerslam and if he loses then Who Cares.  I'm just going to the gym more now...nothing else to do with free time now
Am seeing SOLO REIGNING
Every single time Usos come to cheat
This is why I did not watch it. Cody should have won. Enough is enough. Its boring
i can promise you, if cody won the fans who are crying here in the comments are going to be the same group of people that will turn on him after awhile. This loss is going to save him, and now he has a character development as a babyface.
I think the usos lost so jey can knock off roman it kinda makes sense ‼️🤷🏽‍♂️
Since I can see the dislikes on this I can confirm that this so far has more dislikes than likes. Pay Attention WWE! This was Cody’s moment!
Congratulations 🎉🎉 Roman l don't accept you can win am praud of you, you are the best all the time
In professional wrestling, 'moments' are more important than 'numbers'
weak
Too many nerds in the comments
The Only thing solo did tonight was prove Cody right! He ain’t ready 😂
Bro i'm tired of wwe shoving roman reigns into our throats 🤨
Cody Rhodes joins the known list of Roman Reigns 😒
This sucks, Cody should've won. But from how it ended it looks like we do get to see a triple tag team match up with KO, Sami and Cody vs Roman Jey and Jimmy
Would have been better had he retained the title on his own now its another astrix on his title run .
Im genuinely curious how do the fans feel about this match?  I have been out of the loop for Wrestling for a while, but dont heels typically lose at WrestleMania?
I really upset Roman doesn't deserve to win.  Roman is a very talented yes, but WWE pushed so hard to Roman always, always win, yes I am tired for always being the same thing over and over again this is more tired and boring than a telenovela. Loses the rush and the passion WWE had each combat on WrestleMania.  Cody diserves to be the champion listen to the people WWE and give the champion belt to Cody. When all the crowd sang the song of Cody entrance it's was awesome.  But in the end is my honest opinion as a WWE fan for a long time and I know some will agree with me and others don't but is absolutely normal because everyone as is own opinion and I respect them all 🙏💪. God bless you all 🙏🙏.
That triple Crossroads should’ve ended it. WWE just missed out on the right place and right time.
Excellent Match Lmao The Only Thing I will Complain about is the Fans who Instead of Enjoying and Appreciating the Work and Performance done by these two Proffessional Superstars, they Instead Complain about the outcome because it didn't go the way they wanted it too lmao just play the game instead if you wanted Cody to win so Much
Ini lah yg bkin bosan liht  wwE
I kinda glad that Roman remains. They should build a good long story for losing titles. Like Zayn/KO vs Usos story. American Nightmare story was way too short. I wasnt invested.
And the reign continues
Cody should have won dammit who is next now!!
I guess wwe has no business with Rhodes family let's Cody Rhodes live wwe&join AEW
2024 The rock vs. Roman reigns 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Useless roman
Coding winning is too obvious be patient and watch how the writers play this out.
They're definitely going for that 1000 Day title reign
Don’t smash the throne that you might want to sit on in the future.
Wrestling Is Dead In The Words Of Batista: "What The Hell Has Happened To This Business" Its So Corporate. They ruined Cody Moment I have never been so heartbroken and sad for a wrestler then I am in cody. He tore his pec for this sorry excuse of a company and yall took his moment away the nerve of some bonehead fans to say he will win it's part of some far fetched empty plan for him to what maybe win on a nonsense episode of raw or ppv nobody will remember for years. What did Eddie Guerrero die for !? Seriosuly moments and champions are born and etched in stone at wrestlemania. Yall Ruined Booker T in 2003 and buried sting in 2015. Refused to make sami world champion when he was OVER AF and burned cody. I stopped watching wrestling for 3 years. The future of this business is down the drain. Cody I'm so sorry. Wwe will keep thriving Mark's will keep paying them fat loads of money so this B.S will continue
Strangely the umpire was very preoccupied with Paul Heyman to allow Soloa Sika to interfere .Part of script?
Randy has to comeback and help Cody how to win a tittle
Who will be next to lose
AND STILL....  CONTINUES THE BRUTAL REIGN OF DOMINANCE AND TERROR.
Poor Cody..Match Of The Night Besides Seth Rollins Win! Hopefully You'll Win Money in the Bank🥶💫
I can't believe how some of you really thought Roman was gonna lose to Cody Rhodes, he best Brock Lesnar twice to lose to Cody, come on now, it will be either to the Rock or to Solo, or another match with Brock, this storyline to good to give up on now, yes Drew and Shamus are out of the picture , Cody returning and beating Roman ha please
That “WOAHHHH” at 0:20
ROMAN REIGNS DID IT AGAIN !!HE DESERVES IT
is roman legit not able to get through a whole match without the usos showing up? this is turning into the nwo 2.0...
If Cody won tonight….what direction do they go.. keep it with Roman more story lines Cody will get his chance just not his time. Not even a bigger draw than Roman.. this is also a business more than entertainment.
Romain iz nothing without solo cody dersev a rematch
Cody should have won! Roman never won a match by himself neither at Wrestlemania or Summerslam which proves that he sucks! WWE, make Roman lose and end his reign  already! And also change your script! It's only a matter of time before Roman loses all the respect that he has left.
You can argue that whatever stage they do have Roman lose on  won’t be as big as this, and you’d be right! But that being said, NARRATIVELY, it’s not a bad call having him retain. It’d better marketing for him to pass 1000 days, Cody’s rise to the top isn’t so predictable and easy. Now we can have a role reversal and have Sami be the one to give Cody a pep talk, and they can finally end Roman’s reign at Summerslam 3 years after the debut of his tribal chief character. Bigger picture!
This was great watch this match last night!!Both winners!!Roman Reigns come back on top win again and retain both titles again!! Bloodline never breakup anytime soon.🌴🌴💛🤍🖤🎞️🎥🎬📽️☝️☝️
Since they said, that Randy was in the building... I was hoping Randy would come in to help him bcuz of their past "Legacy"
They'll finish the story at WrestleMania 40. It's just more fitting. Roman becomes the best champion in modern history and Cody finally beats him. We said the same thing about Theory, he just beat Cena at WrestleMania. If anything, this just makes you want to see Cody beat Roman even more. People needed to truly hate Roman, also people thought Sami should be in Cody's spot, that won't be the case anymore. We just witnessed the best and biggest WrestleMania of recent memory. Lets acknowledge that.
WWE's problem is that they do what we want but not at the right time. WWE knows we want Cody to beat Roman but instead of doing it at the biggest PPV they would rather do it at a smaller PPV. Makes no sense.
Does Scar eventually defeat Simba and continue to hold the throne?
If they dont put the belts on Solo at Summerslam, this will become possibly the worst booking decision in WWE history
Cody was fantastic feel sorry that solo hit him so he lost hopefully rematch soon.
The end of Cody's winning streak 😢
The Rock vs Roman Reigns at Wrestlemania XL. can't wait to see it...
Zwykli oszuści
The era of wwe ended with ufc taking over. It's the beginning of a new era of the aew
What a greate match, sad part Cody didn't make, 😢
Well at least we got a happy ending for KO and Zayn. See you next Wrestlemania boys and girls.
Poor Cody. There's always next year (or Summerslam).
You guys that think Cody should have won are stupid. He's not a star that's why he left if wwe don't see you as a star that can carry a company next ten years you'll never be the guy that's what Cody is. It's a feel good story but he can't carry the company like Roman ,Cena, Rock,stone cold,undertaker and so on
I now don't like Roman Reigns because he always brings the team
Cody ain't finish yet & The Bloodline they will break up it's coming.
언제까지 로만한테 다 먹힐껀데 지겹다
Is Vince sleeping w Roman?
Roman Reigns The Best 💯👆
The bad storytelling continues.
roman is getting pushed way to much this lost for Cody is fully disrespecting the Rhodes family its ridiculous they could put the titles on Cody. Cody has worked his a** off to get where he is deserves them wwe has never treated Cody right if I was Cody I would never have come back! maybe if we take over the show, us fans kind of like that one night on ECW CENA vs RVD. maybe roman will lose the belts this is why i dont watch wwe anymore
So lame
As always
So disappointed, I hate that Umaga great value version. The hype when Cody almost win was the best.
Tonight was the infinity war of WrestleMania.
Whelp, Im just waiting for Sikoa to fall along with his brothers, the Usos. I kinda fed up with this gimmick already.
I am about to hate WWE for making cody lose it was Cody's time HIS RETURN and he loses like that
I'm so tired of this roman winning
Roman reigns(the undefeatable villain), having his title reign ended by cody rhodes(the undefeatavle hero). Would have been an epic finish and benefit the legacy of both men. This would also have been the greatest wrestlemania of all time, if it wasn't for the wrong disgusting finish. Maybe hunter didn't forgive cody for the throne smashing he did a few years ago, lol.
The REIGN continues....👍👍👍 The dream ended...an Cody woke up to reality!
they did cody dirty tbh.
Great freaking match but I'm still freaking pissed everything to the storytelling was perfect Roman's downfall should've been  at Mania but no they want him to have a thousand day reign & it looks like it's gonna be at SummerSlam  when he lose the titles I mean that's good but it's not Wrestlemania.
Another legendary match ruined 😢  It was Cody’s moment not Roman
This along with sami and ko winning gives me some backlash after wm25 vibes. 3v3 for all the titles makes sense and it also protects roman while getting the belt off him.
What wwe does not know maybe , the company is losing more fans day after day with this cenarios 👎👎👎👎👎
If he was meant to lose then they should’ve never brought his pops into the feud
This is why I stopped watching when the attitude era ended! How predictable was this BS!?!? I don’t even follow it anymore but they’ve built Roman up to being “unbeatable” and truthfully idk how you ppl still watch it!? Cody is fully capable of carrying the company on his back IMO a lot better than Roman ever could but I think he’s still being looked down on for leaving and starting AEW years ago. Although he came back he did a lot of stuff in that time that unfortunately the powers that be are still making him pay for.
Shovel reign
Stupid ending
RoMaN ReInGs ☝️🔥🩸 forever ☝️🩸😎🥇
Roman winning is fine if done right. They just needed to change the status quo a bit with this match. Make Roman earn the win by himself in the last few minutes and then scream at the Bloodline for not being more useful. When the Usos came out and still looked 100% loyal to Roman, I kinda guessed he wasn't going to lose
why bruh
I’m watching it right now ever one
El daño ya está hecho  Gracias Mr mcmahon Gracias wwe  🙄
Cry if you can, but the story couldn't have ended that way, Man was build up for a reason and the story has to have a perfect end either by this own cousins causing him his title. Cody is Good but WrestleMania isn't the right time to end. He should be beating legends and great talent after his return to reach the equally standard of Roman to accomplish that and it will come soon. Possibly splitting the title.
Cody ❤
Nahhhh roman you are always a buster all along
Cody and WWE were in good momentum. Until, Roman, retaining, it's just terrible and boring.
Man it was Cody's time...
A lost is a lost but cody will always be the greatest in my opinion ❤🇱🇷
Their entrances alone made me ultra hyped for the match. Felt like Superman Vs Thanos.
Disappointment. They blew it
God Awful booking for Cody and Asuka tonight. Absolutely unforgivable wwe wasted the best storyline in years for Roman to continue being the most boring overrated champ in history. Canceled peacock and will not be back until Roman drops the titles.
Cody should’ve won
💔 cody should've won
Day 1 100% good. Day 2 100% suck.   The same of the last 2 years of Román gay. With helped
It’s going to come full circle and Jey is going to come after the titles Roman holds, watch.
Man this match should have been delayed for SummerSlam because it would have flesh out the story more and show the audience why Cody was the guy and Roman would have reached his 1000 days as Champion y'all see where I'm going with guys?
I Hate Solo SikoA!
Leave it to WWE to screw up something that is as unscrewable as a nun.
Roman is the beast incarnated lol💪💪💪
This was a MAJOR mistake. They better hope Cody can sustain this momentum because at this point idc anymore. This was their only opportunity like this is wm. Not a lower level ppv
Was cool with roman retaining. It's the first adversity Cody's had to face in this storyline an it was just expected for him to win tonight. If he would of it would of been a really cool moment but roman winning is fine to because it just creates a new element to the story of Cody now trying to come back from failure of not finishing his story at the biggest stage. Only thing I wasn't really a fan of was the overbooking of the finish but that seems to be a standard triple h thing atm with these roman matches
And Still Our WWE Undisputed Universal Champion ❤❤
Right person won. Split the titles now and give Cody the raw championship at Summerslam
Roman ❤
I really feel that this is a build up for something big... young bucks and kenny omega will be at cody's side by backlash or summerslam to even the odds!
WWE, you have got to stop making these mistakes. You ruined a great moment for Cody for what? How many times do we have to see the same thing over and over again?
Corward.. R.R have backup every time urgent match.. not behave not gentle,
☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️
Long Live Tribal Chief Roman Reigns🐐☝💪congratulations🥳
Bloodline makes too much money for them to end it right there.
Cody Rhodes should have won.. roman reigns doesn't play fairly 😡boo roman reigns
Terrible result. 👎👎👎👎👎
The voice of heyman he is all yours
awesome match and acknowledge your tribal chief roman reigns hé IS thé one ❤❤
Cody, is OUR Undisputed, Universal, WWE Heavyweight Champion of the World!!!      What a botch book in the end.
The truth cody is your winner but anybody can't beat  roman if they alone..
Idc what y’all say he’s our tribal chief the goat of goats and there is only one man that can take him down and that’s Sami he’s the one that should end his reign after the 1000 days mark
Cody rhose 😢
Cody got screwed like booker and the rock.
Easily one of the worst wrestlemania main events of all time
Cody's push is forced. Getting the 30 slot at the rumble and coasting to and winning at wrestlemania would've been a boring story. Him losing here is great. Now he can actually earn his spot and Roman can hit 1000 days.
I think Roman still continued his Reigns to full 1000 days as champion before drop the title i think
If Cody won would’ve been booed in a month, they over pushed Cody.. only one that deserved that win was Sammy
👍👍👍💪
We need Randy Orton to return to reunite with Cody ft. KO & Sami to take on The Bloodline.
کدی فن های عزیز فشار بخورید 😂
Roman is the greatest champion of all time and this is the greatest championship reign of all time...Acknowledge him!
Vincent K McMahon  all over that
I was expecting Cody to finally dethrone the Chief. But then again, Professional Wrestling is just filled with clowns, jokers and sideshow actors.
Acknowledge him🙋🏽‍♂️
So raw and smack down still don’t have world titles cause all they have is a part time champion.
It's unfair 🥺 ban usos and his younger from interfering match is really bad....let Roman reigns prove himself to the world his the greatest
Yall did Cody dirty
Oh man, he still hasn't been defeated, there has to be somebody that can beat Roman Reigns
ACKNOWLEDGE ROMAN!!!!! ☝️
WWE is trying to make Roman reigns a dominant champion. He only wins with the help of people, that is not being dominant
When Roman lose his titles
Never change WWE never change LMAOOOOO
The loss was better for Cody’s character imo
RKO Summer Slam, 1-2-3.
Cody should have won
It was cody time and you guys blew it.  Idk what wwe is thinking.  This entire reign has absolutely killed the title picture.  Cody losing here kills his momentum.  This is like of triple h never lost during the reign of terror and never put over batista.  We need a new champ and wwe needs stars built up.  Edit:  People who are actually defending this i swear are giving into recency bias.  There's no logical reason Reigns should've won.
Roman reigns🎉🎉🤫🤫
that was the best moment for roman to lose the titles man absolute trash of an ending
Really thought it was Cody's time. Great match. Cody is very fast and quick. Excellent athlete.
Way to mess up a storyline wwe
The bloodline Roman reigns 🥰🥰😘😘😘🥰🥰🥰☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝💪🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽
Who think roman is a loser
This cheating has got to stop ☠️
What a wasted opportunity....
Well boys me and my friend mark is gonna stop watching
There will be no better stage and person for Roman to lose to than this. Even if he passes a 1000 days, it will be to a less significant atmosphere.  Cody deserved to win!!!!!!
Its all part of the story. it only will make cody winning the title mean so much more.
This is so conflicting because Roman deserves to reach 1000 days for his run but also it was a perfect time for him to lose because it was vs Cody.
원래 타 단체에서 넘어오면 승리를 안주기로 유명하죠 wwe가 우위에 있다는걸 보여주고싶어 하기때문이지요 뭐 추후에 코디가 재돈전을 할지는 모르겠네요
BS ending
Just don't understand the decision to go this route they build of Cody to win the rumble precedes to be undefeated even ends solo's winning streak only to lose at WrestleMania like okay I guess
Cody wants a rematch!
It seems roman can't win without cheating 😂😂😂
HHH 🎉🎉🎉🎉 and creative team thanks
What makes sense is Jey Uso or Seth Rollins taking the gold from Roman Reigns
THANKS FOR LETTING ROMAN KEEP THE TITLE'S. This is best for busines. Cody acknowledge Your Tribal chief
The Goat ☝️☝️☝️
Feel like people online are a bit overreacting yes Cody loosing is a bummer but not every outcome is gonna be perfect. After this if not Cody at Summerslam it must be Seth considering Seth is the only one to beat the Tribal Chief Roman granted via DQ but still he beat Roman
Cody should have been the one to be the NEW Undisputed Universal Champion.
This main event was dope as hell but Cody had Roman beat.
Roman
With the right finish, this could have been one of the greatest WM main events of all time. The unpredictability, dope entrances, , the crazy atmosphere and phenomenon wrestling. This was amazing!
Roman
What a bad call, perfect change to build the next big baby face of the company and it was passed on. I am legitimately confused. Did Triple H and the creative team not listen to the reactions Cody was getting the past 3 months? This was his moment.
Luger Moment
The ending to this match is as good as our service at Signature Mazda at the Richmond Auto Mall!!!!! aka trash
Roman
The exact same generic ending every single time  What a waste of potential for such a good buildup..
Roman
I can’t believe Cody's championship dreams were shattered.
Welp, I can't say I'm not dissapointed with the ending.. Nonetheless, great match.
I can’t believe they didn’t pull the trigger here. Screw you WWE
Someone please tell WWE management to put "Roman losses the titles" in the script because I bet that the whole WWE universe is bored of Roman retaining. and that is a FACT
Roman
Good Match👏🏽👏🏽Roman Reigns 💪🏽❤️💪🏽 and Cody Solo💪🏽❤️💪🏽 was Ready! Tonight☝🏼
Roman Reigns knew that he couldn't win on a one on one against Cody Rhodes The American Nightmare
Where was Finley & JBL?
Welp king Cody is coming we all know it 😂
They messed up the storyline
Don't forget to leave a dislike
Bro Big Fat Pig Heyman should be detained.
It's a solid 1/10 for me.
swerve of the century
What a match🔥🔥
Acknowledge the tribal chief Roman reigns Cody rhodes
WWE had its best story lines since the attitude era with the lead up to WrestleMania the ending of Cody Roman reminded me why I don't watch WWE regularly anymore.
even if for just one belt they shouldve given cody his moment
God, cody
The fans did not go home happy with this mania night 😢.
YES!!! With Roman winning I went 6/6 in my picks today 💰💰💰💵💵💵
Man Cody should've won now I don't know who can beat Roman for the titles maybe MJF or Kenny Omega if HHH can sign them.
Thank you WWE! Roman Reigns is the greatest athlete in the WWE. Cody Rhodes is just another footnote like his father and brother.
The only way Roman will lose, is when the bloodline is fully destroyed. Jey is the only person that should truly end it. It started with him and it should end with him.
If you think about it, they probably didn’t want the guy that started AEW to win the WWE Championship
Raw after WrestleMania is going to be VERY interesting 😂. I'm excited to see what goes down.
Hopefully Jay White debuts on RAW tomorrow. That's the only thing that would make me happy.
Roman wins, but maybe he'll lose at Backlash if Cody has a rematch?
I can't believe Cody lost to Roman Reigns. That Devil has to pay for his crimes. 6:30. 🤯!
The Tribal Chief defends his titles again. Excellent work. The Head of the Table Roman Reigns ☝🏼👑
They had the story  They had the place  They had the moment  They should’ve just ended this reign
Well now i know how it would been if big match John had a heel reign. Also Vince is definitely back.
Good
This Really Hurts!!! 😭😭😭
Acknowledge him!!! ☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾
Roman Reigns is Still Unbeatable. Is there a way to defeat him?
They ruined Cody’s moment just so Roman can hit a number that most people won’t even remember in a couple years. Shame
To be honest, I am not surprised about the result. As what was mentioned in one of their promos, Cody has never lost a match since his return. And to have his dreams shattered like that, makes his comeback that much sweeter. And to be fair, there are still a lot of storylines that can happen with Roman as champ. One of which is a sudden call up from NXT, and having the Bloodline implode in a shocking manner the same way the SHIELD  broke up. At least that's just my opinion on the matter. What do you guys think?
And the robbery of the night goes to...
Storyline is stale now, it needs to be said
Wwe really like really.... You had one Job just One.... Give Cody Rhodes the championship
Over pushed.
L ENDING WWE I BLAME VINCE OR PAUL MICHAEL LEVEQUE 😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡
The match was epic but I really was rooting for Cody Rhodes to win but the bloodline once again interferes
Let me guess after cody loses he’ll challenge reigns to several matches and he’ll still lose repeating the SAME thing with interference and cheating, when does the cycle stop?
🤡
Such a bad ending to WM 39 after the awesome Night 1. Cody should've won. Simple as that. Some might say 1000 days of Roman's reign have permanently cemented his legacy as the greatest champion in Modern era but it failed at telling long term story telling. Losing the championship at the grandest stage would've more significance than losing at a smaller PPV which everyone would eventually forget. Any way bad luck Cody. Seems the direction came from the top, likely Vince.
Cody will still get his moment, and it will be against the 1000+ day champ!
Acknowledge him☝🏻
No title changes on night 2 why I thought it was wrestlemania
L match
Right man won ☝️
Unbelievable...
It was Cody's time man. It was Cody's moment.
🩸🩸🩸
First 1
First 😊
Cody lose lol
Seriously? When is roman gonna lose his titles..💀
STUPID ENDING
First
if you guys are gonna make sure Roman retains the title, at least make the finish a little more different. It seems so repetitive. Ref gets knocked down, twins get involved and he picks up the victory. this match was pretty predictable
First
That's it, someone hand me my boots. I'll take care of this Roman problem myself! 😎💪
Helluva Match!!
fist
seth rollins is the one who will defeat roman reigns and he will sooner or later
