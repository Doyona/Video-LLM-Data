Dislike for force awakeness
4:05 you can "write it down" in braille.
3:08 I mean, he IS a comedian
half convinced that bill murray didn’t know wtf he was doing half the time and the directors just rolled with it because it was bill murray and they were lucky to even have him there
1:20 that's a rad shot and it cost them nothing lol
These are so fake. If any of it is true at all, they refilmed the scenes, and did not use the actual footage for most of these.
Who watches this chit?
Then Hoffman farted during the interview with Cruise, and they both laughed.
he dropped the ball , and gandolf also knew the wall was there
You mean to tell me that in Evil Dead they didn't just tell the dirt to fall in a specific pattern in order for Ash's face to be visible? It just happened? No way, I don't believe it.
That scene from Captain Phillips always seemed so real and I thought the medic was extremely professional. Now I know why.
4:52 it may not have been scripted, but that was no accident.
The other famous one from LoTR is Viggo breaking his foot kicking the Uruk-hai helmet and screaming.
What about the fly in raiders?
Kindergarten Cop has made my day 😂
FART, FART, cant open the door. lmao. I like to fart as i leave the lift and the door closes and traps it. once i heard a dude get in not long after and shout FUCK SAKE
69 seconds in... Will Smith is warming up for Chris Rock
I love when actors just acted and didn't feel the need to talk about how little they know of politics.
We don't speak of sequel trilogy, sir.
Harrison ford one made me laugh
I wonder how they chose the thumbnail? 🤔
The reason "bloopers" that are kept in make a movie better, is because they make someone or a show more "real" and relatable - aka having a soul and life. When things are too scripted AND rigid, the movie or show can seem to robotic and won't be as memorable
In the Navy and Marine Corps they are called corpsmen not medics. Maybe they call them that in the Space Force.
Here's a bunch of things that everyone already knows because this video has been made ten-thousand times.
Why the AI voice?
So technically,,, that code 4 signal is him pretending to be a cop....   Oops
Don't narrate, we're not idiots.
Lol Mark Addy saving the scene like a pro. Gods he was strong then.
7:30 bro fr edited her boobs to be bigger for the thumbnail lmao
Another classic by Mr Hoffman "I am walking here!"
5:24 "Nuclear wessels" ???!?  Ai shite commentary, or poor typing....
I think improvising stunts could be a really bad idea.
BRO DID NOT SAY NAGGER WE ALL HEARD HIM SAY NINJER WE ALL HEARD HIM I REPLAYED IT 10 TIMES THEIR WAS NO A IN THAT HE DID NOT PRONOUNCE HIS NAME WITH AN A NAGGER MUST’VE BEEN THE DAMN WIND  LMFAOOOOO 😂😂
The lady in the back at 2:41 lol
6:05 other actors fighting, Andy Williams losing it xD
Did y'all really double ScarJo's melon size just for the thumbnail lol
Omg the no cheering, can't speak English...killed me 😂😂😂
2:10 I looked up Miko Hughes info who played that part. His father was a special effects technician. So, that was clearly not improvised.
3 cups of whole milk, 3 cups of plain flour, 3 eggs, a tablespoon of melted butter and you get perfect pancakes.
Good content + good thumbnail= 19 million views 😂
Why is the scarlett johansson asset is bigger on the thumbnail?
Crazy how AI channel has me watching clips 😅
1:53 Arnold what now?
none of these scenes were improvised
The pacing was just right.
Fart… FART
You deserve every bit of success coming your way.
I actually learned something new today.
She said across the bay in Alameda!!!
American humor: farting
AI voice is terrible.
Im so glad he narrated the entire clip. As dumb as people talking during movies
7:05 I don't understand. So did a man really try to make that jump and fall that distance?? And if so, how was he not injured??
Those guys in Under the Skin were not actors?! Jesus Christ!!! That's just gross.
Sure he did. Just happened to be framed perfect for the punch out huh.
Loved to watch this when i was young!
1:52 WHO?
Why dont you just stfu if your making a video about bloopers, people can look and hopefully think for themselves
😅
Why sign 4 to the chopper? Radio's not working? At that distance it can be seen as four but also as middle one...
I hope the horse kicked Lo cappo back in the face
I was part of the crew (extras) in the Czech Republic, and the claim is nonsense. It was all in the script and it was fully planned. Notice how many cuts there are in that scene. It was the director's instruction, not the Czechs' inability to understand the script. It was fully scripted!!! I don't like that this kind of well marketed nonsense makes our nation look dumb.
No need to talk through EVERY blooper
POOR Horsey 😅
Really appreciate this upload.
6:22 that laugh actually killed me haha 😂
Arnold sports what??
5:16 nobody could fake that 😂
4:00 You know braille is a thing, right?
Realise the camera is  focused on the clock in joker. Then another is focused behind the parachute for I.Day...  And think to yourself, how did they know he would improvise that...?
Such a made up video. Yawn! 🥱
the knights tale one is the best. damn that movie is a classic
Haha tom cruise at the end and Ray repeating “fart” 😆
That Buster Keaton stunt was utterly insane
Quite sure that Under the Skin thing is illegal.
I wonder what it would have been like if Arnold was Obi-Wan and  Harrison was Mr. Kimble...
The Gandolf head bump was scripted...
What a load of horse shite 4:48 any normal person can look at his hand see how NOT accidental that drop is.
Just wait until they start pumping fresh river water through pipes to the Great Salt Lake dry salt beds, and all the plants and animals from the fresh water die, and everything sits there and rots. Then it will really stink. I don't know what we are thinking here in Utah, keeping our lawns bright green, watering, watering, watering like there is no tomorrow. Soon, there will be arsenic in our air. I told my grandkids not to stay here. Move west, young men. Move west! Or East or North or South. Just don't stay here.
"Did you fkn fart?"
if its in the movie  it can not be called a blooper ye gansch
I really do not get it, why farthing is so common and funny in the US... It´s disgusting and an insult to your actress college..
Videos that include pheonix automatically prove themselves to be trash. Blocked.
Anyone noticed they edited scarlett johansons boobs to be bigger in the thumbnail lol
Quill dropping the orb was perfect for his character and it showed off his personality early on in the movie. I don't think that was an accident.
We all know why we clicked.
I do like your content, but would you be so kind as to truly Bleep all profanity? Appreciate it
awww HHAHHAHA
Punching out joke was good 😅
In La Grande Vadrouille (1966) Bourvil is supposed to help De Funes come down the wall. Instead De Funes lands on his shoulders and they improvised from there. One of the best scenes of the film. https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sm8SLE_dfoc
1:53 Excuse me.. Mr what?
"Did you fart Ray" ? "Explosive diarrhea..... Explosive , definitely explosive diarrhea" 😆 💩
LMAO "WHAT THE HELL IS THAT SMELL"
1:52 that's not his name it's an e not an i smh
OK
Code 4 means all clear
Помереть и поблевать им только дай
It really does smell bad if you're on the wrong side of the Wind in Utah.
Paul Reubens? I thought it was Sara Gilbert. 😂
Morgan Freeman isnt even the person voicing Vitruvius wtf xd
You cut the scenes way too short, we don't get to appreciate them enough
I'd have gotten in that van with Scarlett Johansson too.
yea this is lies.
Did you just photoshop Scarlett Johansson Boobs on your video click pics?? Cheap
The kid from Kindergarten Cop still cracks me up, and impresses me. Cannot get over him mastering gynaecologist and vaginas in the one sentence 🤣🤣🤣
0:18 really wasn’t planned? They just so happened to have a second camera set up to film the box coming off the wall. Bullshit. I love when people just regurgitate something they heard somewhere.
Lies
No one cares about will smith.
how can the punching out scene be improvised if there are multiple camera angle looking directly to the machine. You  all fall for this bs?
No one talks about Ron Weasley beating off in his room with a middle-aged man disguised as a rat
It's little accidents and the ability for good actors to improvise them into real material for the movie that makes so many memorable moments.
Fart, fart
2:05 is that for real?? how could they be telling that to their kids!
1:46 one of my favourite parts of the movie!
1:53 what did he just say 💀
I wanted to be a gynecologist until I found out it would be like working at a deli looking at my roast beef and swiss cheese sandwich creations all day long, with many of them being well past their “sell by” date ! I chose to pursue a career as a “new construction plumber” instead. 😎
7:23 That's just messed up right there. But good, potential cheaters need to be exposed 😂😂😂
Paul Rudd: Dutch oven specialist
Captain Philips, you left out the whole point of it, the marine medic said he acted so well like one with trauma that she forgot it was Tom Hanks for a moment.
I'm not an actor but I think it would be pretty easy to stay in character after a mistake for an actor on set
Sir Ian didn't ''play off hitting his head'' lol he hit his head. There was no acting in that. Haha he had a headache that day from it. That scene there isn't Gandalf that's just Sir Ian lol.
1:52 Arnold WHO...
When something is spontaneous it works because it's more real than acting
You made Scarlet Johanson's tits bigger for the thumbnail. You thought no one would notice, but I did.
2:07 kazoo kid ?
5:25  Wasn't an *actress*.
Arnold what?
joker is the true timmy tuff knuckles
Lol 😂😆 🤣. Lmao. That's great  laughter is the best medicine.
The cigarette flick is funny af xD
0:29 "punched clean"???
5:17 That's gotta hurt.😅
Gandulph 😂😂😂
2:51 Chez-republic huh... thats interesting
Wow, the medic scene at the end of Captain Philips was the most genuine and hard-hitting moment of that entire movie, and to learn that it was entirely unscripted? Tom Hanks is amazing.
best is Will Smith in ID 1:13
The fact that the thumbnail is making the algorithm recommend this now is crazy.
1:51 HAVE SOME MORALS AMERICA 😡😡👎🏻👎🏻😡😡😡👎🏻😠🤬🤬
these ai voiceovers.. Shit me.
DeCarlos Brown should be behind the actress on thr thumbnail
“The director thought it was so good that he kept it in the movie.”   Nooooo waaaay! Seriously? He kept it in the movie?! What a profound commentary and insight.
6:32 Corpsman not medic
I heard that horse wasn't happy when it got kicked in the face. Later, Di Caprio asked the horse, "Why the long face?"
My grandson and his friend were watching Dazed and confused.    I pointed put the part where Ben Affleck cracks the paddle on the ground and breaks his own ankle.  But, still completed the scene. 😀
Not true. All the greatest lovers in history were also the greatest fartists
Tom cruise deserved that fart
The farting in bed and the ad lib.  Don't fart in the bed, this why we never have sex"  is the best ad-lib in this bunch.
2:40 The two ladies in the back certainly didn't know when to cheer either
7:22 for the thumbnail “blooper”
Lame video terrible ending
The thumbnail edit restored her to her former glory 😂
exactly those kind of moments makes them more realistic and relatable
Scarlet Johansson looked great with black hair.
a bunch of fascists went to a movie set lol
I just hate it so much. Just roll the tape. Stop talking. Just stop talking.
1:51 Arnold what!
Phoenix wasn’t acting  😮
Yes, the double-take from the terrorist guy in Die Hard was great! 😆 Bro said "I can multi-task" The fact that it gave him more scenes than he originally got and he got to be the last to die 👌
lol that “enhanced” thumbnail. Classy.
You didn't have to photoshop, Scarlett Johansson's boobs as click bait man, shame on you.
Making Scarlett's boobs bigger in the thumbnail to bait clicks is pathetic...
Improv or not, if Scarlett Johannsen is luring me to a van consider me seduced..
farting in a phone booth is so classy, even better when Cruise is in it
I have never seen one of these movies.
I figured the Usual Suspects cigarette flick was not the intended plan.
2:03 not scripted
1:54 hard R too
moral of the story  if you want to lure men just use Scarlett the fuck Johanson. women is a dude magnet.
1:53 erm excuse me what
😮 its the spring😮
0:16 wasn't in the script but a camera was right there
That scene from A Knight's Tale was legit one of the best. RIP Heath
1:53
In Jurassic Park, during the Trex breakout scene, it wasn’t supposed to break the top glass roof of the car (at least not in the way it did), but the animatronic was too heavy. The screams of those child actors are real - they genuinely thought they were about to be crushed.
2:54 is that robert baratheon's actor?
real sex machine LMAOO😭😭😭
That came from Breaking Away when the kid punched the clock.
The rain man seen w phone booth was filmed on hwy 152 in my home state.Slowly the phone booth and fuel pumps all went away decades ago
Gandalf bumping his head upon entering Bilbo's Hobbit hole 😂😂😂 childish I know but so hilarious 😆
100000% Chris Pratt did NOT fake that drop
3:35 😂
😁
The 'punching in machine' is called a timeclock.🤡
ох уж эти маркетинговые истории
How can you film someone without him knowing? You need to have them register later at the Actors Guild? And what if these "random" men didn't want their wives to see them hit on another woman? I don't buy these "did you know that in the movie" things - some of them are clearly PR stunts by the producers, they are just stories to make the movie go viral
Tom hanks scene it was surreal. I felt it, the relief and emotion of being rescued. Props to the great actor!!
🍼🍼
Most of these are just lies lol wtf
Eu vejo ditadores e imediatamente dos dislike.
3:03 What an inconsiderate SLOB!
3 others come to mind that aren't shown here. In the beginning of American Graffiti when Terry the Toad pulls up to Mels in his Vespa, he really did lose control of it and smashed into the vending machine.   And in Coming to America when John Amos's character keeps running to the door when Daryl is ringing the doorbell, in one scene, he trips on the stairs and falls down. That was not scripted and he just stayed in character so the scene was left it.  Then there's Indiana Jones who was not supposed to shoot the guy with the big sword..
1:23 such a cool way to keep the scene going
listen if Scarlett Johanson pulled up next to me and tried to get me into her car I know damn well I'm getting in lmao.
....Entering bilbos hobbithole ... holup
i think we can all agree robin williams might have started the trend of improvs in movies since he is an actor comedian
Ever heard of BAD TRIP?
In a stage play of "Camelot," King Arthur is spying on the arriving Guenevere, but falls out of the tree.  Guenevere is supposed to turn to Arthur in surprise.  Instead, she deadpans the audience and says, "We're going to have an early winter. The nuts are beginning to fall from the trees."
5:03 Giggity
Most of that is accurate, but not all.
2:41 You can see one of the extras raise her arms, about to start cheering, then stop herself as she realises she jumped the cue. It seems like they knew they were meant to cheer, it just wasn’t communicated to them at what point to do so (and since they didn’t understand English the speech wouldn’t have given them a clue).
Wow.... the "punch out" joke was the ONLY JOKE IN THE FILM. About the "JOKER." And it wasn't even written. Pathetic
and that shot from beneath (punch out) also blooper? right
5:23 The woman adlibbing “across the bay” was Layla Sarakalo, a fashion designer who did indeed get herself hired as an extra to pay for her towed car. Unfortunately, they weren’t legally allowed to use the line because only SAG members were allowed speaking lines, so at lunch time Leonard Nimoy cornered her and signed her up for SAG membership. Layla said she didn’t think they would use the line, and was surprised when she heard it in the movie.  Layla died a few months ago, aged 74.
It is always the fart.
Was it really necessary to make Scarlett Johansson's breasts bigger in the thumbnail?
@07:21  makes you wish the alien was real
The woman who got them to pay for her ticket was genius
Do any of these scenes look improvised to you, especially when the camera is angled specifically for the shot?
none of these were bloopers. They were all scripted.
Not all improvisations are bloopers.
Maybe six of those were really unscripted
I was the only person in a packed IMAX theatre who laughed when Joker punched the timeclock off the wall.
Oh brilliant the children 😂😂
Dude, when there are multiple camera angles filming that very moment, it's not a blooper.
Man I love our global - volunteer militaries
Good stuff
This goddamn AI voice. Gonna dislike all of them from now.
1:26 that’s actually cool 👍
I hate AI channels with a passion
Stephen Baldwin is an absolute lunatic.
See I don't know about these "this wasn't supposed to be in the film" things... Like the one of Arthur punching the clock in machine off the wall in the Joker. You say it was improvised, yet the film switches to a camera that's clearly focused on the clock in machine, almost as if it was in fact planned lol.
Aw man, you didn't include the classic coconut dialogue from Monty Python and the Holy Grail!
This should be called "improv," not bloopers.
I always thought, she was the one farting during sex
My dad looks at vaginas all day long 😂😂😂😂
If I was part of the entire cast, and Paul was messing around by farting in the bed, I would probably be pretty upset. Get that is kind of funny, but most people find fart humor pretty disgusting
yeah it was stuck on with Pritt Stick
1:50 uhm... I think we need to teach the bots how to pronounce his name...
That first one with joker is a fake. There were no holes,screw,or nail marks. Just what looked a little bit like super glue residue. Dont try imitate heath ledger just because you want to be a bit more popular.
Why is extra funny when words just go together, like the last scene, "did you fart, did you fucking fart"
Harrison Ford looks like a senile confused old man.
Bit*ch, its SIR Ian McKellen!
How did those men in "Under the Skin" not realize that they were in a movie when they were approached and seduced by Scarlet Johannson? I find it hard to believe that they don't recognize who she was. She had already shot Iron Man 2 and part of the MCU so I would think that her face would be pretty well known.
1:53 You did NOT say Arnold Schwarzenegger 😭
The twins sent me 😂
Imagine meeting Scarlett Johansson in a random car then seeing her on the big screen years later
Actually the scene with Will Smith in the flats was because one of the guys kept ripping ass on set
2:20 hey now  I'm a all star lol the actors from the music video
0:49 😂
if you're scrolling and feel off, read this. i was burnt out, low energy, not myself. found Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks, had zero expectations but man. chapter by chapter it rebuilt me. no hype bs, not fake motivation just stuff that grounds you and resets your system. this book really saved me. wish I found it sooner.🔥

not gonna lie, i felt numb for months. like i was just surviving, not really living. then someone dropped Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks in a yt comment and i gave it a shot. bro… this book gave me my edge back. not by yelling at me to hustle, but by showing me how to fix my foundation. life hits different now.
If you’ve been wondering why you’re not feeling as strong, motivated, or sharp as you used to, Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks might just have the answers. The book focuses on the power of testosterone and how increasing it can seriously transform your health and mindset. If you’re tired of feeling drained or out of balance, this book offers some solid advice on how to get back to your peak
Tried all the hacks. ice baths, preworkouts, even dopamine detoxes. none of it clicked. I felt so tired everyday. then someone dropped Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks in a comment and I checked it out. been locked in ever since. no hype, just clarity. wild how long I was running on fumes.🔥
He stole “punching out” from the 1979 flick “Breaking Away.” And Will Smith is dead to me.
This is awesome lol
Literally 90% of these “bloopers” were intended and not funny accidents.  That they are not scripted does not mean they were spontaneous or improvised.
"Fart." "Fart."
hahahah love the kids 😂😂😂😂
*Farting and trapping someone in a phone booth is diabolical* 😂😂
1:50
It’s funny, I specifically asked YouTube for bloopers with no effing narrator, and look what I got. I hate this search engine.
Arnold WHO??
The scene of Robert E. Lee being celebrated by the Confederate soldiers is beautiful
3:16 that horse is staring through my soul... 😰
🤣too much funny
Watch the leather man ahaahheheuh
Lil homies dad has the best job in the world 😂
1:52 bro thought he was slick
A film is created 3 times, when it is written, when it is shot, and when it is edited.
Did you know that a toe was broken in 2 towers?
The Navy Corpsman wasn't improvising that. That's a medical assessment. Checking for bleeds, assessing mental status, assessing ability to hear (given all the trauma Cpt. Phillips went through), visual deficits, hand-eye coordination deficits to assess any brain trauma.
Meh I think bill Murray first tripped for real then made a joke out of it by purposely falling to the floor, great physical scene tho by the way he stood right up
7:06 are you saying the attempted jump was real and that fall ended up as lucky as it looks?
Bill and Robin knew how to fall without hurting. Once time I fell and threw my mighty hip down just because I knew it would roll me gently to a stop.
i don't believe you
The gandalf scene was no accident. He thought of dping that on his own without talking to them. He is an actor in the end. He knows what he is doing.
I hate nuclear wessles
Imagine a world with human narrators...
6:15 Mathew Mcanihue. If your being paid to act like your high on Marijuana,  might as well do it the real way.
I farted 💨 during the watching of both those scenes
Not all of it is true.
Punching out was a scene stolen from Breaking Away with Jackie Earle Haley. Another Hollywood rollover
Was gonna say cool video but then i noticed you edited your thumbnail with a bigger bust on scarlet, what the fuck.
3:08 what the fk you mean the crew were not amused? they all women?
1:22 as a so cal officer. I thought this was in the script! Dude did his research! EDIT: South CA with the SO.
Damn thumbnail 😂
Thankfully no eye injury happened, i searched the topic ..
The confusion on Harrison Ford's face 😂😂😂😂
no one cares anymore. its over. they are all horrible people. no matter how many videos you all make.
The Harrison Ford one makes me laugh, his face is hilarious🤣
It's been more than 20 years since Sir Ian has laid the head bump urban legend to a final and complete rest. It wasn't an accident. McKellen came up with the idea and acted it out. And Jackson conveniently put the camera in a perspective from which Gandalf didn't really have to bump his head. There's a cut immediately before the head bump.
Ok thats probably the only Joke in Joker that was actually funny and not morbid, still a good movie though 0:30
I had a lot of respect for King Robert Baratheon..he is a hell of an actor...!!!
Yeah!
7:29 sCARLET joHANSONS TITS
Under The Skin surprised me. I went and did some reading and wow, they really did use hidden cameras throughout most of the film. That's really interesting, now I know I gotta see this movie.
"Fuck the shrimp". I miss Robin Williams.
LOVE this entire video! So entertaining and impressive!
Farting in that phone booth was diabolical. 😄😆🤣
dammit got clickbaited again
How come that when I'm luring ppl into my van I'm arrested even thought I had the excuse that I was maybe making a movie
Robin Williams did a lot of improvising.   When he did talk shows.   Others would just stare in amazement.   He was so funny.   .
Hey hey hey watch the leather men hahahaha 😅
Amazing that they had the cameras in the right place for do many 'unplanned' shots ...
a note to actors i guess, always stay in character
The “you talkin’ to me” scenes in Taxi Driver were not in the script. Robert De Niro was doing some method acting that happened to get caught on camera and they put it in the movie.
Imagine your disappointment when you find out Scarlett Johansson is not really trying to lure you in!
Well if this is actually true it is hilarious….especially the farting.
Tom Cruise's first Wiff of the Insides of Dustin Hoffman!!! Closest Thing to a Atomic Sheet's Sceen Ever!!😂😅
when he "punched out" how come there was zero attachment points on the wall behind the time clock ? yea big bloopers
I absolutely adore that you can genuinely see tom Cruise attempt to push Dustin Hoffman with about half true force like you would a buddy. Like any good buddy who just stank you out Dustin pretends not to notice and you can see his arm slide down to bar the door from opening (if you've ever been in one with someone and done this or a small closet you'll recognize it immediately). Too funny.
Being actualy seduced by Scarlet is amazing to me
Narrator, your voice and voice style are boring.
1:53   Arnold what??
🤣😂🤣🤣
5:19 if you freeze frame his face, Ian McKellen can be seen smiling under the fake beard
Nope. If the camera shifts then...
This is all bullshit. Maybe dropping the orb.. But I really don't think any research was done. But congratulations you got my view because the scene with Scarlett's 🦉🦉
Missed George C Scott's tumble in Dr Strangelove
not the edited thumbnail
The thumbnail and title made me think that I’d like to see Scarlett Johansson naked and then her clothes would fall off, instantly. By the time she’d get them back on, I’ve seen everything.
4:40 And this is the reason in the real Civil war trenches should have been filled with confederates to avoid MAGA now.
How is the scar Jo one even barely legal?
The punch out scene was cribbed from "Breaking Away."
I would have farted on Tom too.
Not funny farting on people 😷
These bloopers are cinematic gold!
1:53 am i imagining shit or did the tts/ai voice say Arnold Schwarzen*gger
So the only thing keeping Scarlet from the life of a seriel killer is... motivation?
Dustin Hoffman is a notorious "method" asshole, so him running with the fart is mild for him.
I stopped watching after a first "blooper". Yeah, that blooper so they even recordet it with a retake in a diffferent place. Your movie is stupid.
This video is total nonsense
Scarlet Johansen did not use a body double in under the skin btw.
Isn’t that punching the clock bit lifted from “Breaking Away?”
I feel like a lot of these are false...
Surprisingly...all cameras were set to exact frame where actors improvise.   😅😅😅...all publicity stunts.
This channel thinks that a director would allow EXTRAS to mod an actor and say "Let's go with it! They have a good idea!"
@1:10 should of kept my wifes name outta your alien a$$ mouth lol
Code 4 does NOT mean no further assistance needed. I means the situation APPEARS secure. Officers will use code 4 in lieu of saying all secure. They say that instead because if you say all secure and it turns out otherwise then buko problems happen. Saying it means no further assistance needed is fake news. Thanks youtube for posting bullshit.
Its so uncool about the fart! Only Americans would laugh about that! well also germans!
I dont appreciate you using the F word. That is a hateful sexual word based on pedophilia Fornication Under Carnel Knowledge. It is a terrible word that will drag you to hell. Cover it next time. #MissionaryMan777
Scarlett Johansson would have been a very prolific aerial killer if her character was real. I mean how many of us would have actually got in her van? Probably most.
This is all fake.
AT 1:53 I PROMISE YOU HE SAID THE HARD R
My personal favorite is dr Strangeloves legendary screwup “Mein fuhrer i can walk!”
What the narrator meant to say was that female in the scene with Tom Hanks in Captain Phillips was a real Navy CORPSMAN. The Navy does not have Medics.
Such a shame, so many of these are not bloopers or ad libs. They are scenes that could be mistaken for that, or include some “raw” reactions, but most of these scenes were written or planned in the way they appear
As is so common, so many clips are edited too tightly. They fly by so fast. A couple dozen frames before and after would enhance their enjoyment.
Good thing they had the camera set up to catch  that "spontaneous" clock scene
Pfffffffffffffffft... steam
"The director found it was hilarious and decided to keep it in"  You say that every 5 seconds lmao
So many of these are not true. Lazy click bait. btw I'm not answering replies... just informing the misinformed. Can't figure it out? Your problem, not mine.
That Code 4 one is incredible, what a good guy! So many times movie sets end up with emergency services present because someone hasn't notified the right authority or filed the correct permit, so without breaking character this actor not only performs the part and enhances the shot by including a helicopter, but also let's the services know not to waste their time checking it out. I absolutely love that!
3.06 "I'm not farting the bed is creaking." Thats my line to my Mrs they've copied 😂. (If we are anywhere else; frrrrrt.. "look there it goes... a mouse on a motorbike") ☺
99% of these are lies lol
When he enters bilbos hobbit hole 😂😂😂
I especially loved how when in Home Alone 2, when Tim Curry runs out of the hotel room he hits his knee on the small table knocking it over and he puts it back in place and limps out. That wasn't in the script and he really did hurt himself there.
Farting ... christ. does he think he is funny? its disgusting and unprofessional
ai narrated? how about if you dont even speak so we can hear?
I was a sailor on the USS Abraham Lincoln CVN 72 in Alameda CA. It was a real port, closed now.
Fart fart. Did you fart? Fart fart lol
7:28 what....?
2:04 A real SEX MACHINE
The A Knight's Tale improve was hysterical. Objective failed successfully.
Paul Rudd should've given her a dutch oven
2:11 BRO IM ROLLING ON THE FLOOR💀
07:30 BOOPeesee.
Wow, hard to believe the men in Under The Skin weren't acting! I'll have to rewatch it.
“Men have a p*nis, women have a v*gina”…..well, so we thought in Kindergarten 😂😂😂
Great upload! I knew none of this before today
i really need some bloopers of lethal shooter
The woman who got them to essentially refund the fine they made her get for impounding her car is kinda a boss.
How was captain philip a blooper
Okay... actingike braille isnt a thing and theres no way for blind people to read is wildly ignorant tho 😂
Will Smith is always funny
Fart Fart Fart best line ever
I’m calling utter BS on the majority of these!  And why are you calling scenes that were intended to be improvised ‘Bloopers’!?
...and what a nice and relaxing endin
Walk-in Phoenix
The actress on this is 40 is so damn hot she never ages...
Not all true!   Actor behind Johansson on bus was in sex scene with her later.
And yet another 'Blooper' video where the scenes are improvised and not bloopers..
1:53 Arnold who?
bloopers ≠ improv
@7:24 lucky them
most of these aren't even bloopers
This video would have been a lot better without your useless commentary
bs
Fun Fact: The two movies The Winds of War and Gone With The Wind were movies written based on farts the writers heard or dealt while thinking of what kind of movies to write.  Hence, the word Wind in both movies.
Don't fart in the bed !!!!   is my new ringtone.
I thought the thumnail was from the film LUCY.... 😶
I wanted to add a ‘like’ for every clip 😂. Thank you for the video :)
Absolute bull on the buster keaton one 7:03 if he missed once he would have died there
everyone love farrttttt
Buster Keaton operated on a completely different level.
Is that Scarletina Nappi in the thumbnail?
The kindergarten cop lines couldn't have been improvised. That means I can't believe anything in this video.
The video filter user really did hard work on this one
The children thing is false
If you believe most of these are "improvised" then your probably stupider than you think you might be.
Instead of the other way around
Watch real bloopers, as soon as it happens usually crew or another actor will blow any potential of even using the take.
Yeah, Scarlett Johansson got some good bloopers
Code 4 KÜHL AF
Scarlet Johansson tells you to get into a van, you get into a van.
Rain Man is such a great film.
Who else hated the first film as it was 💩
RIght off the bat BULLSHIT! They had to set the clock up so he COULD punch it off the wall, hence it WAS PLANNED!
6:49 iconic
made up slope to get views
I’m gonna need someone to explain to me WTH is going on at 7:05.
Scan. False accusations
If you actually believe these were bloopers then I have some awesome magic beans I want to sell you.
the Scarlett one is creepy
Making movies and music is HARD!  https://youtube.com/shorts/-RvG6P0wPiI?feature=share
w  to mam
Man oh man Joker was a masterpiece. I love how terrified the little person was, yet Arthur had empathy for people like him (people like Arthur, aka his guest) and never hurt him despite brutally murdering those other guys. So good.
6:07 you can even hear him trying not to laugh
How were none of those guys like “holy shit you’re Scarlett Johansson”?
phone had via
"Nuclear wessels?" 🤣
That scene with chewbacca was perfect, harrison fords reation was spot on and you can see chewbacca scolding him like a mothet when he hands it over.
No actual bloopers. Just good improv.
Source: trust me bro
That joker scene is a freaking lie!!! They have two cameras angle but say it nit planned 😂😂
Steven Baldwin getting hit in the eye shouldn't be funny but oh God, I can't stop watching
What you did with Scarlett's body in the thumbnail is disgusting 😡
TRUMP is the funniest actor in the political theater world.
Nobody like Keaton
6:25 That laugh 😆.. can feel him🗿
Collaboration makes truly great things happen
So fucking funny!!!😁😁
Steven baldwin
Have a happy new year TheLaughPlanet
You're gonna tell me that buster Keaton didn't mean to miss that ledge and fall through 3 awnings and grab a pipe- swinging into a building was a mistake?
It doesn’t take much to confuse Harrison nowadays lol.
Under the skin story sounds like cap lol
Loved the video but that quality man...... On 4K its one blur 😞
1:51 blud just said the n word💀
As a fan of Usual Suspects, I always figured that cigarette hitting his eye wasn't planned.
Disgusting, is this the US men way?
The best ad libs: Dustin Hoffman in Midnight Cowboy-Hey, I’m walking here! And Robert DeNiro in Taxi Driver- You talking to me?
What’s a bloop? Bloody poop? That’s naaaaaaaasty.
In “The Return of the Pink Panther,” they left a blooper in the film when Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) went undercover as lounge lizard Guy Gaudoir to keep tabs on diamond theft suspect Lady Litton (Catherine Schell) at a nightclub.  His over-the-top smarmy approach and deliberately bad French accent had Schell busting out laughing in every take.  Blake Edwards decided to keep that in the finished film because it could be viewed as Lady Litton seeing through Clouseau’s cheezy act and reacted appropriately!
If the punching out in Joker was a blooper how come there were two different shots of it
Code 4 guy = respect!
Scary what actors had to do in films before CGI.
Shameless thumbnail. Enlarging an actresses chest for clicks is wild
1:00 WIll Smith improvised since Chris Rock was smelling too
Umm yea no....a few maybe but no not all those.
this video have me laughing at 1 AM
This was fun to watch!
Fascinating. This was a great idea!
Let's be real... we all clicked on this video because of the thumbnail😂😂😂
Punching the clock was already done better in Breaking Away 1979.
I'm proud to say I would have gotten in the van with scar jo....
You're telling me those twins weren't supposed to tell a camera, in unison, that their mom says their dad is a sex machine? i don't believe you.
Bloopers making their way into a finished film brings so much life into it
As someone who repairs timeclocks, "punching out" when fired is not a funny joke.
The scene with dude failing that roof jump was hilarious!
Those look like super-duper bloopers in that screenshot.
1:53 its pronounec arnold schwartza NAYGER
Of all these I thought the Capt Phillips scene was very well acted…….the improvisation was perfect.
1:53
"hheeeyyyy waattccchh the latherrr heheheeee" that shits too funny
1:51 schwarz what?
Hey watch the leather man ah...ah...ah...ah😂
sneaky job making her chest bigger in the thumbnail you sneaky sh**
yup, first thing to hear is fart .. what a good introduction .. XD
People fart more often than we think they fart...
10/10 sad I didn't know about van scarjo
I looked at the thumbnail and read the caption as *"when movies boobs are to good..."*  Help me Lord 😭😭
I love watching movies. And I love trivia about movies.
The vid is just too short :)
Knowing that the clickbait was improvised makes it 1000x worse
4:30 future MAGA supporters
“Hobbit Hole” 💀
the twins from kinder garden cop rewatching it as an adult : " mom why you tell us to said that "
The scene in The Grinch where Jim Carrey pulls the table cloth and everything stays upright, so he runs back and knocks it all over was improvised. The director thought it made yhe scene that much better so he kept it in.
when i grown up , i want to look at virginal all day long.
Alex? more like (A)(I)ex
They should not have allowed him to flick the cigarette at the actor. That was cutting it too close, as we see from the result. That’s the one blooper I knew about.
1:53 Arnold WHO??? 🥷
Was it really necessary to photoshop the frontpage of the video? 😂
This feels made up for the most part.
1:52 Arnold WHATTTT ???!!!!
Obviously their meals don't show up splattered all around the tray from the jostling and the time spent wrong side up before it gets to them.  Mine are always a total mess when they get to me.
Harrison ford confused is so good
That brine smell of the Great Salt Lake is horrible!
superb
The guys chatting to Scarlet Johansson will have those memories forever.
6:29 I was sure she is a real pro when I watched the film.
I dont know if Joaquin Phoenix took it from there but in the classic 1979 movie Breaking Away, Jackie Earle Haley also punches the clock in a similar scene.
why did you edit scar jo's chest to be huge? weird as fuck... not to mention the fact most of these aren't bloopers and the narrator is a nails on a chalkboard ai voice. lets pick a new career path!
I call bullshit on the mysterymen one. The guys power is farts... And hes standing infront of an open flame... Theres no way that wasnt scripted.
This is 40 is hilarious...u know this goes on in so many homes!
The delayed cheer scene in "A Knight's Tale" was already a favorite...now it's even better 😂
I do not know why but Chris Pratt dropping that Orb and it having been an accident,  seems a Lie.
F...the shrimp ha
Joaquin Phoenix cutie 🥰 😘❤️
1:51 Arnold SwartzWHAT⁉️⁉️😭
Where's the part we all clicked for? Some Tig Ol' Bitties.
Anyone who release gas in front of me is not something I'm taking as a joke or comedy: that is an offense.
you forgot that movie made by the life of brian creators where the actors get arrested at the end from the english polish who had no idea of the movie being filmed
“Punching out” and punching the clock off the wall came from Jackie Earlie Haley from the 1979 movie Breaking Away
Didn’t the guys know scarlet?!😮
He could be making all of this up
Start with a fart, end with a fart. Classy
Keep that smell, out yo damn mouf!
I wonder if the "accident" with Alec Baldwin was improvised?
2:11 and he looks at ba-😂😂😂😂
Improvs give movies so much more life
The real Captain Phillips was an asshole, he treated his crew terrible.  They hated him.
It’s cool how the very first one isn’t a blooper
Harry Styles on the cast of The Usual Suspects?
0:17 it’s not in the script but you have a camera point right at it?
1:53
2:41 two of extras cheer early, then try to pull it back. Double goof.
Sooooo many of these are absolute nonsense
I usually know these but I only knew about the horse kick, nice job.
Hilarious that you had to photoshop her boobs bigger for the thumbnail.
No way u just upsized Scarlett Johanssons boobs in the thumbnail
just imagine getting picked up by Scarlet Johansson.
Thinking about how they pulled off Under the Skin is mind blowing, and those scenes now make more sense.
1:52 😨
That scene from A Knight's Tale was over the top.  One of my favorite movies.
I know acting is not easy but the most outstanding one keep in character and the parts that were not scripted seem like part of the movie
funny
bros dad is a gynacolo what 😂😂😂
Seeing Scarlet Johhanson sitting on a stagecoach bus and sat in a van outside a Morrisons just seems so weird to me. Like Scarlet Johhanson, an American Hollywood actor, was sat on a bus in the same way I would be on the same bus to work. Weird how paths collide.
how much good cinema results from men’s gas?
this guy seriously photoshopped her tits at 7:29 and made them look bigger in the caption. Talk about bad clickbait
Yes, Phoenix improvised it, that's why there's a camera blocking a shot precisely to show the punch-out clock falling.  Dude....
filming people with a hidden camera......
Who?
Joaquin's punch out joke was genius
Arnold who?
🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭
wessels
2:11 I am not but I do look at those things all day long
Fake
This is awesome
Also the Usual Suspects line up scene was a blooper
Why does that one dude from the usual suspects look like stiles from Teen Wolf😂😂
you gotta have balls of steel to flick a cigarette in the face of stephen "bio-dome" baldwin
"oh no i forgot to punch out" had to be the funniest one 🤣
Actors improvising lines or gestures: “yeah, the filmmaker thought it was genius and kept it”.  Buster Keaton, creating a whole gag of falls around a dangerous jump that failed and could’ve likely gotten him severely injured, or worse: “Hold my trampoline.”
The difference between the thumbnail and the scene at 7:30 was certainly a... choice.
1:46 but why is Chewbacca moves his mouth like a human here 😂
AND WHAT THE HELL IS THAT SMELL
1:53 "mustve been the wind" ahh
people really think the kids talking about their dad being a guy who looks at vaginas all day and is a 'sex machine' wasn't scripted? when it sounds exactly like a man trying to fantasize about what he wished his life was instead of something kids would think of? let alone it being innappropriate for their parents to be telling their kids. crazy.
Ye kuch nhi move dega , kal theek tha ..aaj friday h ek toh
Oi data btao bhaiya
OI wala data smjhao sir abhi
Arre bhaiya Bank nifty hold kr liya .. wait kru ?
Not going to mention the bad things about him. Too much time
Well. Hello.
0:15 no way. The camera has it framed perfectly.
The "under the skin" one must have been a bit scary
Gettysburg blooper is so coldddddd yooooo
Jake Gyllenhaal is so fucking great man, the fact he knew that specific thing AND used in the movie is just so cool-
That scene alone of Independence Day speaks for itself. It’s an awful depiction of speciesism, and really brings to mind how humans treat animals at dairy and meat farms. Abused and shown no empathy, simply for not being human. Horrible. If some galactic neighbors actually wanted to destroy humanity, I’d help. 👍
That punching out joke is legitimately something to appreciate
I knew it! That fall of Bill Murray in Scrooge was bad...i still can feel the pain in my ankle...🥹
How is the Scarlett bit a blooper? Johanbate!
7:22 Guys seduced into getting into a van driven by Scarlet Johansson without knowing it was a film...... They better hope their wives don't find out!
How tf did this not include the opening scene of Usual Suspects?!?!?!? 😂 Or the whole movie in general? Everyone just basically f~d around because they thought the movie was going to be a flop!
6:23😂
The Captain Phillip movie made me wonder why multi billion dollar shipping companies don’t  have a legit security team onboard at all times to even the score.
watch the leather man ehheheheh
“Here’s Johnny!” In the Shining is another example.
5:25 - this is a massive no-no for extras and is MOST cases you will be removed from the set for trying something like this. But in this case, quite funny.
That pot fried his brain
1:53
1:52 Arnold what ?
How do you know it *"WASN'T SCRIPTED?"* We all know it WAS all scripted.
The punching machine was in the script
swartz what ???? lol
If the 1923 scene wasnt real how come the cameras where ready to film them in the rooms after he fell......anyone ?
I ain't here for the bloopers, I'm here for boobers
What a disappointment, when i saw the video i knew it looked short
youre out here making the tits bigger for the thumbnail. jesus christ
1:53
Yeah the first one they just stayed in character and acted like any married couple.
Best one for me is 2:45
Was making Scarlet's chest larger for the thumbnail a photoshop blooper?
One of my favorite movies is Boiling Point. It was a very overstimulating show, but that made it all way too realistic. Most of it was improvised. The actors were just told what the scene was and they'd go from there, not any/barely any lines given. It's a great movie. The acting is beyond any I've seen before, likely because it's more than just acting--it's responding.
1:34 Thought Harrison was just like "why you handing me this you big idiot? we're fleeing" and it was just him going "Why is he pranking me in this shot?" lol
1:53?????
Thats a very convenient camera angle to have for the joker to improve the punching of that box
I'm guessing less then haft of these were actually non-scripted accidents
I know now how to say the N word. 1:53
everything is unscripted these days they say
These are not fact checked. Many of them were indeed scripted.
This guy made the woman boobs in the thumbnail bigger than it actually is 7:29
That was definitely one of the better unscripted videos I’ve seen. Learned a bit too.
That’s not how you say Arnold’s last name. Stop doing that.
NICE
Oh, back when Scarlett was developed.... and I can't say how much I respect Arnold for doing Kindergarten Cop.
OMFG  I'm glad I'm old and I saw a lot of movies a long time ago!  These movies all look so fake, contrived, moronic...
God, how I needed this!  😂
In punching sceane how come second camera was at right place. there are blooper and there are intentional bloopers.
When he said "the crew was not amused" to Paul Rudds farts, I instantly thought that most of the crew were women.
wait back the fuck up....what did u say at 1:52
Arnold what?🤨
arnold what?
I would for sure be lured by scarlett johansson
2:08 was this kid also Gage actor from original Pet Sematary movie?
1:53 thats sus. U put a lot of effort in saying that word 😏😏
1:51  shorts what😭🙏
1:53 excuse me, who?
Buster Douglas had balls of steel
IN CHARACTER,  is a real place...😂
“The most memorable scene in wolf of Wall Street” mmmm idk about that one👀
ARNOLD WHOOOOOO!?!?
The tom hanks scene..the other sailor..the male...is my neighbor...still so weird
Jhhhhhhh
Force Awakens is shit and does not deserve to be on any list
improvised doesn't automatically mean its a "blooper" smh
this is why i love movies' its take it like there task we need to finish
In Wolf of Wall Street that was the worst scene in the entire film, hands down. Now that I know what it was, it makes sense why it was.
1:52 what did he say 😭😭
Excellent video!
Nice clickbait
😂
How do u know all this
How amazing was Buster Keaton
4:10. My husband and I say this to each other,  all the time, still lol.
That's insane that missing a jump like that was all in a day's work 7:07
Captain Philips was such a good movie
1: 53 is crazy
So Will Smith's violent temper isn't just shown at film award ceremonies.
A BLOOPER IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE MOVIE!!! IF IT IS INCLUDED IN THE MOVIE, IT IS AN AD-LIB!!!!
8:15 that clickbait tho. Hats off to the editor
Honestly, the fact that the actor knew what code four meant and rolled with it was impressive.
now why on earth did u photoshop scarlets chest to look bigger in the thumbnail?? 😭
I think the scene in Pretty Woman where he's giving Julia the necklace and shuts the lid on her hand was not scripted either, because she looks at the crew for a moment as if to say what the?
Uhmmm what’s up with the thumbnail???
Chewie: "Leave no evidence."
Who is wil Smith 😮
seeing  blooper videos is believable but i dont believe any of this was bloopers
1:52 Muhammad Ali be like: what did you say? Schwarzenigga?
1:53 ...
6:20 Arnold SchwarzeWHAT
The most memorable scene in Wolf Of Wall Street did NOT involve Mathew!!!!!  It involved a certain buck nekkid blonde goddess.
Johnny Depp falling down the stairs on Dead Mans Chest????
This video is mostly a ripoff from other channels
For the 'Dazed & Confused' Clip:: All I have to say is; ... It was a different time home skillet, it was a different time.
Stop talking.
Huh ?
I am not letting what you called arnold go lol I heard that
2:22 this is taking me out
Didn’t he break his hand while punching that thing too?
1:53 i cant get over that name
This is a lot of bullshit!
The fact that my subtitles labeled the very first fart you hear as "music" has me dying.
4:44 its terrifying how many americans still remember the old south and the confederacy as a "good" thing. I wonder when theyll try to bring back slavery 😂
“ 1:53 Woahh what did I just hear”
Paul Rudd is an idiot. zero talent
At the Star Trek IV scene, at 5:35 when the lady mess with her own hair, for a moment she looks like to be a Vulcan.
The BEST Blooper in the movie is in PRETTY WOMAN in NECLACE Scene...😄😄😄
2:11 😁
I love watching bloopers that made it in. Theyre hilarious😂 Rons scene is one of my all time faves
Arnold what?????????
Kids are innocent 😂
The fact that the "YEAHHH" scene in knights tale was unintentional speaks of how good that movie was for it's time and to this day.
Sources ?
We walk, in The garden of his turbulence 😂😂😂
I love Matthew McConaughey!!! ❤️❤️❤️ 🚬
Hilarious
Aron sort what …?
“Fuck the shrimp!”-Robin Williams
I feel like most of these if not all were scripted but your making up some quick story to make us think they are unscripted...Id like to see how you "know" these are not scripted events.
Yes the salt flats look cool but smell like a sewage.
The creepy men in under the skin gives me an ick
I call BS on most of it. Bloopers don't have multiple camera angles.
You said "wessel" instead if vessel!! WTF??
I gave thumbs down because you used the joker!
😂
The joker scene was deliberate. Dont make sht up. Why was there a perfect camera angle for the clock? You know what we should put a camera here in case joaquin suddenly goes off script and punched the clock.
5:17 That sounded like it hurt a lot, that was quite a thump!
I hate Will Smith.
😂😂that’s my favorite when Ron falls off the couch.. he was already acting so love sick ❤ that it made it just so much funnier when he feel over the couch. Like he was just not paying attention because all he could think about was his love of his life. I’m happy it was left in since it truly made the scene 100% better..
the Bill Murray part made me laugh so hard. I've never seen that part of the movie and I was not prepared for that shit.
"F*$! the shrimp"
1:54 it’s a name😊
My dad looks at vaginas all day long 😅
The whole scene with Bronson Pinchot in the art gallery in "Beverly Hills Cop" should be on this list as well.  That's one of the all time classic improv scenes.  Bronson made up everything on the spot, and Eddie Murphy's smiles are for real, trying to not break character and just roll with whatever Bronson says.  What was originally a forgettable character with probably two lines became one of the memorable moments of the movie and helped boost Bronson's career.  And as somebody else noted, Dustin Hoffman's infamous "I'm walkin' here!!  I'm walkin' here!!" from Midnight Cowboy where he breaks character, switches to his real NY accent and starts pounding on a taxi cab hood that almost hit him for real should have been at the top of the list.
The brine shrimp smell is sooo nasty here in UT. When I first moved here I almost barfed driving into SLC. Between that and the methane fart ass smell from the oil refineries...it ia almost too much.
lol I’m not sure I believe some of these…
the one fall one at the top of building was planned though
Trust me - the chest beating scene in Wolf of Wall Street is NOT the most memorable scene.
Joker. If it wasn't scripted then why the camera aet up.😗
5:21  Smart!
7:29  Deeeamn i need to watch that movie ASAP  😏😏😳
These aren't bloopers, these are ad libs
Last one doesn’t surprise me in the slightest
I love under the skin so much!! In one of the scenes ScaJo falls on the sidewalk and people help her get up, asking if she's ok, and it's also not scripted! It adds so much to the development of her character :D I love the little things in it
good video next time really don't bother with the voiceover, please
4:32 f ur pronunciation Bontaneously !? spontaneously is what You're trying to f spit right !? f u
Omg I need watch under the skin, again!
Who ever put this video together has absolutely no idea what a blooper is.   What exactly was the "blooper" in Captain Phillips?  The Navy Medic was a real Medic,  what exactly does that have to do with a blooper?  I mean did she trip or something?
Geoeoagohakin, go home! we only need Nicholson!
2:40 😂😂 Yeaaaahhhhh
1:53 I’m sorry WHAT?
and the camera angles were conveniently there huh
this is amazing
096 Muller Hills
1:53 💀
This video lived up to it's title. I want to watch some of these movies, they look like funny movies.
The way you said Arnold was sus
1:52 is kinda crazy
Melisa Rapids
1:53 thats not how u pronounce it
2:45  that's hilarious
lol Stephen Baldwin is a G
Hauck Passage
Caenogologist. That's so frigging cute.
00:02:16 Paul looks like a grimy Allen White with bad hair
00:33 So you want me to believe this was not scripted, yet there are multiple cameras aimed directly at the clock? 🙄Not buying it.
That lady was a boss to sneak in a line to get her car out of impound!
7:30 thumbnail
Hey, where's the fall of Captain Jack Sperrow??
Punching a clock off the wall isn't a "blooper." Bloopers are accidental occurrences.
Joker punching out isn't scripted but there's a camera close up ready for it 😅
Do you remember the moment when leonardo decaprio was abusing heroin in wolf of wallstreet , believe it or not that wasn't planned at all
That's confused Han Solo
Leonardo Di-AgeGaprio
1:53:5
Well, in Joker and in Independence Day we see two different camera angles. If there were 2 cameras in each scenes, we could see camera 2. So, these were in the script, or after the first rehearsal directors thought to leave those improvised bits in and record them again n again take after take. I stopped watchin this video by I.D. because of the obvious missinformation.
Every day we see more and more evidence that normal isn't coming back! Jesus Christ is! Get saved today!  Read 1 Corinthians 15:1-4, Romans 10:9-10, Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 3:22-28, Romans 5:8-9, Ephesians 1:13-14. Rapture any day now! Come Lord Jesus! Amen!!!!!!!
4:22 Example of Karma...
1:53 whelp there goes your pass
The confused Harrison Ford made me laugh so hard
A lot of these don't seem improvised lol.
What is the point of learning your lines in a cgi movie?
Imgine your gramps tells you a story one day how he got lured into a van by Scarlett Johansson
7:28 so she really k1lled 3 guys? What a high class acting by Scarlett Johansson. Bravo
Having Scarlett as a seducing bait is evil
1:52 bro said it
garbage
man that cig to the face would have anyone seeing red
A knights tale is such gold and that blooper fits it perfectly
1:53
Bloopers and improvisation are different.
"watch the leather man ah hahahaha"
The cigarette flick-in-the-face made me laugh :D
GANDALF HEAD SMACK!
1:52 Arnold Shwarze- WHAT
I would get in a van with Scarlett Johanson too
1:53 thats wild
I cry foul on half of these.
Yeah he dropped the orb by accident,  that's why his hand turned before setting himself up to catch it
Code 4 Suspect in custody
Arnold Swarze who?
Wtf the thumbnail was edited to make her boobs bigger 😂
0:50 I laughed so hard and I played it back again and again XD
7:22 – for anyone wanting to jump straight to the Scarlett Johansson "blooper"
I just rewatched Scrooged a couple of weeks ago and I rewound that falling bit several times because it was just perfectly done. I applauded Bill in my living room for his perfection. Oh well.
The thumbnail reminded me that Scarlett Johansson had a breast reduction. 😢
2:23 serious edward scissorhand vibes
I always felt that the Scarlett Johansson luring scenes in Under The Skin were realistic. Now I know why.
@1:57 lol, bro picked the two most obviously scripted lines of the bunch though  😖👍
Independence day just happened to have the perfect camera angle?
didnt expect robert baratheon and vision to pop up
Its lucky that a lot of those improvised scenes have cameras in the exact right place to capture those impromptu scenes
1:52 you are not slick bucko💀
I remember hearing stories about Scarlett being seen in Glasgow driving a white van...Aye right !!! Well turns out the BS was true
1:51 What did he saayyyyyyyy?????
Flipping a code 4 to an actual LAPD heli while dressed as a cop is freaking cool I guess
Improvise is not the same as having a blooper.
Wait those were lines the kids came up with for their own parents rather than... oh wait I dunno what would be worse. Introducing those lines themselves or the parents sharing these things...
The alien must have said something about his wife
what movie??
Love arnorld Schwarzenigger
7:25 😂 she BlueBalled alot dudes in the making of that film, but a cameo is better than nothing
Big titties onna thumbnail
Big titties onna thumbnail
That captain Phillips scene was intense.
I am not sure if some of these were not scripted. Specially some of the oldest ones
Eddie Murphy is great at improv
DUDE LITERALLY ALMOST COMMIT SUICIDE!!!????
Perhaps my favorite instance of this is in Punisher '04 when a mixup with some props saw Thomas Jane stabbing Kevin Nash in the shoulder with a real knife. That take made it into the final movie.
Who the fuck is Will Smith?
6:26 that laugh fr fr😭😭😭
Paul Rueben’s no mystery men looks like lip gallagher
DD gets around
Man that interview with Albert was insane. I think she said that after the scene she was concerned about Hanks' mental health because he played that role so well. She got big backlash for even being in the movie at all from her peers so the interview is just lost now probably
Paul Rude am i right? 😂 (no, but seriously, why fart boy was not fired on spot for this childish digusting stupidity? [If it's actually real])
Bro the photoshop on the tag is sorry
*1:53* I don’t think that’s how you pronounce the name…
In the United States Navy, medics are called Corpsman.
How ever the director found it hilarious and left it in.
This makes me wonder just how many gold scenes didn’t get make it into the Final Cut of our favorite movies because the actors couldn’t stay in character
Some solid movies here
Harrison Ford: Did that Yehti just hand me a parka?
Tapping on your chest can help clear up congestion and thus help the actors say their lines better, with better breathing !  :-)
Arnold Schwarza-who? lol
@3:00 don't fart in the bed! 😂
Peter Jackson didn't decide to leave anything in the Lord of the rings he simply didn't cut anything out of the movie
Julie Andrews didn't stumble and it is prety clear on tgw scene.
Hilarious.
4:56 😂
Paul Reuben pure genius
What a load of crap
most beautiful breasts
If your content is of quality, you don’t need to make Clickbait that was cheap move
I can't believe they didn't include "I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here!".
And here's a bit of what e miss when practical effects and real sets are changed for cgi and green screens. No wonder Ian McKellen cried at th hobbit set, nothing to candidly bump his head upon except for the table
Dislike for obvious clickbait thumbnail image.
Sh r imp Shrimp🔥🥵🌼🤪🌈🤧🌻😵
Lol get a life
So wait that Wasn’t Peter Mayhew
Okay the end of watch one is crazy good i love that movie.
independence day.. what a dumb movie..
Nice thumbnail.
the kindergarten cop one isnt true or improve theres a interview with all the kids grown up talking about that scene the twins dad actually tld them to say that the kid didnt know what a gynocologist was when asked to say that that scene was not improve the scene that was improve was when arnald yells and tells all the kdis to shut up and that was their actuall reaction arnald was axtually anoyed with the kids because they were being loud and messing up the scene so the director left that scene in
Imagine thinking scar jo in a black wig is actually hitting on you only to find out its for a movie, id be crushed 😂😂😂😂
There's a scene in Stanley Kubrick's Strangelove where General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) slips and falls over.  I've always wondered if that was scripted.  It looks like a geniune fall that was kept in.
1:53 Maybe say it slower
1:53 IS NO ONE GONNA TAKE ABOUT THIS 😂😂
Dammit! Fuck the shrimp!! 😂
I got Mystery Men on VHS when i was a kid and never knew about the disposable lighter blowing up. Thought that was a genius part of the script to break up an otherwise poignant moment with some humor.
If these scenes were improvised, why does the camera perspective change?
The scene where the Joker blows up the hospital in Batman: the Dark Knight was botched.  When Heath Ledger presses the button to set off the explosives, the special FX team had a malfunction.  Heath stayed in character and when the explosion finally did happen, you see Heath's startled reaction.  Director thought it was a great result and kept it in the movie.
7:22 Thumbnail scene
A smoke in the eyeball is painful to watch!
Old Jim Carrey looks like Dan Aykroyd in Nothing But Trouble.
How did they just happen to have a perfect camera angle on the time-card/punch machine? That wasn't ad-lib, he would have broken his wrist. What blatant lies - thumbs down for stupid content.
I guess bloopers and improvisation is the same thing in your universe.
I love these 😂😂😂
And thanks to Pratt and sh*tty james gunn, now marvel is incapable of letting a serious scene remain serious through and through
Not really a blooper but in the movie Boyz n the Hood in the scene where Doughboy confronted Ferris and his gang, Ferris shoots his gun in the air to scare everyone, all the actors and extras’s reaction was actual genuine because John Singleton didn’t tell anyone the signal for when the shooting was going to happen because he wanted it to look realistic     And   A actual real blooper scene from The Hateful Eight (2015) where Kurt Russell unknowingly smashes an authentic, antique 145-year-old six-string guitar, on loan for filming use from the Martin Guitar Museum. This scene was meant to be cut, a prop put in place, and then for the smashing to occur. For some reason that was probably not communicated. You can see Jennifer Jason Leigh genuinely react in shock.
This has to be the funniest corpsing (laughing out of character) I have seen: https://youtu.be/YnPakfuGvlg
How many y'all clicked because bewbs?
I still do not believe Chris Pratt dropped the orb by accident... Like, how does a ball that size roll out of your grasp?
I dunno if Matthew McConaughey being high would be considered a blooper lol.
There is no way those kids lines in kindgarden cop were not scripted. Sex machine give me a break.
did noone notice that in the thumbnail of the video scarlets t*ts are photoshopped to look bigger lmao
A Movie is Make believe anyway. People are so Gullible.
Nuclear wessels, eh?
2:08 this kid is Michael Reeves?????
Can’t watch Will Smith anymore. Strange creepy guy.
The medical exam scene from captain phillips was amazing.  Love him or hate him but Tom Hanks is an amazing actor      Edit: another great directing choice was to not the let actors who played the crew of the ship meet the pirate actors until the filming of the scene where they meet.  It made the interaction more believable.
1:56 bro thinks he’s slick😂
I'm continually impressed by your creativity.
The "punch the clock" but was from Breaking Away... Classic film scene
1:45 i just can't see ford without thinking about indiana jones, even if this role is probably equally big.
Pre boob redux scarjo would def got me a part to be later discarded.
I totally forgot about mystery men funny movie
My dad is a gynecologist and he looks at vaginas all day long 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 i forgot about that part
Dont fart in the bed. Thats why i invite the girl to my house so if she trys to get bossy ill say bitch its my house
This is almosr as fake as your channel
I'm in the Matrix because yesterday before falling asleep I remembered that Leo cut his hand in Django and kept going. I'm here because this was in my suggestions... I wanna see if that Leo sh*t is in here
I'd do anyway for Scarlett J, that face and body are my kryptonite
I don't believe in a single blooper of this video.
1:52 WHATT
0:48 That sigaret launched towards some body, I was that somebody once, and the girl that launched it was sitting 2.5 meters away from me. The only thing I saw was a fast growing red hot sphere coming towards me until it exploded into a thousand red stars on my pupil. The wind will form a perfect red hot spherical point on the tip of a filter sigaret when it has speed. Had to ware an eye patch for three weeks, before it cured.
What Gary from Joker did next  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09_Hdj9Naos
Arnold What?!
Some of these sound untrue.
Terrible thumbnail manipulation
1:51 lmaoo
I believe about half of that….
4:21 this might be one of the greatest slips in cinema it’s too good! 😂
Thank you for some new scenes😊
How do you not include Leo cutting his hand for real in Django Unchained? The entire cast was legit scared that he hurt himself but his famous rant kept going and they kept filming
But why the cameras are placed perfectly.
The chest pounding ritual is even more hilarious now.
видя сисямбру - кстати вспомнилось мне - а этот то Женькой межнуродником - бывший Кира ) то есть Женька длинный это короткий и короткий сисмбру актрису нашей называл ))))
That Lego one is a lesson for voice actors if they aren’t liking how they are directing their voice acting.
Sooo let me get this straight. In Under The Skin they had guys getting into a van w a female stranger, obviously seduced, happening for real. After they get in they cut and explain what was going on. The dumbass guys say "Oh cool sure I will sign off on it so that I will be in a movie!' You think any one of them even stopped to think for a second that, like everything else nowadays, this will come out online? IOW, now those guys' families, friends. coworkers, spouse / gfs, etc know that the guy they know thought this was real and was going to do this for real?!?! I find that pretty insane if true
Really great video, thanks so much!
Navy has Corpsmen. Not Medics. I was one.
I KNEW there was something about under the skin that just felt SOOOOO real to me. it’s one of my favorite A24 films and possibly the best scarJo film in my opinion.
Not YouTube giving me a preview of a comment that I can't find in the comment section 😭😭😭
"DON'T FART IN THE BED! 🤬" "i-i'm not, it's the springs 😀" "this is why we never have s-- 😒"   AAAAYYYYOOOO you thought i'd say the word, did ya 🧐?
Any good director will tell you that there are NO MISTAKES in movie making.
Imagine being me. I grabbed my wife's hand and walked her to the toilet holding her index finger.  I said look, do you see your sht all floating around in the toilette?  With this finger (I was holding her index finger) you press really hard and your sht will go down the drain. But if you barely push it you'll find yourself here with me holding you by the finger trying to teach you how to flush a toilette. ,.
Photoshoped thumbnail
👍
Is no one gonna mention the thumbnail for this gave Scarlett a boob job? 🤔
improvised?? the scene shots from more than one angel? and u want me to belief its improvised? really???
I'm going outside right now to see if any Scarlett Johansson types are kidnapping.
2:30 Why is there subtitles here?
All these years when Will Smith screams and what’s that smell I thought he was talking about the dead alien. I live very close to the Salton Sea. The smell is awful.
What a bad movie one of the worst
The most memorable moment of Wolf of Wall Street was definitely not Matthew beating on his chest.
This scene with General Lee in "Gettysburg" stemmed from the fact that the director's assistant had been promising us all week long that we'd get to see some of the stars. Particularly Lee. All of a sudden that afternoon, there arises a big cheer from the left of the line and here comes Lee on Traveler. Everyone went nuts and ran out and cheered like crazy. The director didn't have any film in his camera, so he had us do it again and that's what was seen in the film.
Your comment that Vitruvius being blind would make it pointless to write down anything is just ignorant. Yes, blind people can write things down, they can take notes and they can use their notes to help themselves remember things.
3:44 it's absolute fucking cinema though
The cigarette to the face fkn killed me!
anybody else notice the thumbnail was photoshopped to make johanssons boobs look bigger
I mean, it's fcking Scarlett Johanson, I'd get in that van no questions asked
Why did the second kid from kindergarten cop sound a lot like Donald Trump
These aren’t bloopers though lol. They’re mostly just improv
Wow, you completely mangled Joonas Suotamo's name. Literally zero effort put in, just like the entire video.
@TheLaughPlanet Your opinion is irrelevant because you thought it was a good idea to make Scarlett's boobs bigger in the thumbnail and couldn't rely on the quality of your own video.
Another one I really like is the infamous "NICE FUCKIN' MODEL" scene from Beetlejuice. The tree wasn't meant to fall over, so when he screams the line, it's actually him yelling at the set designers
The cigarette in the eye is beyond hilarious lmfao
"Our mom says our dad is a real sex machine" 😂 that tracks in my household haha...  hence the 4 kids who could say that very thing 😁  Leslie Mann is the best!!  Totally realistic reaction to the farting in bed.  My husband has a thing for getting up and farting right into the damn fan, leaving it to blow at me while he goes to the bathroom to deal with that 😅 still wouldn't trade this man for anyone/anything in this world tho haha.
all of these was scripted
None of those are 'real unscripted reactions'. Actors know a scene can take an unexpected turn and they are ready to improvise. .
rudd's fart is the best!
1:26 So always flash a code 4 if you're doing something illegal, got it
I knew Gandalf hit his head hard😂
that blooper from end of watch is the most memorable part from that movie to me lol
lovely
Our mum says our dad is a real sex machine ...😂😂😂😂
1:53 bruhhh he said the n word hard r 💀
We all know the most memorable scene from Wolf of Wallstreet. 😁
bruh.. 90% are not bloopers wtf is this content
A lot of this typically isn't "the actor's real reaction" but rather and instinctive reaction then working it into character. A lot of improv "what the hell is that smell", Will had to choose to be willing to say that knowing it was a take that would end momentarily if he really wanted to ask. Instead, he worked it in
8:04 Actually it was a warmup routine that _Di Caprio_ would often do but Matthew McConaughey thought it would be interesting if they incorporated it into the scene.
Baldwin deserved it.
lord of the rings got me 😂
Ty❤
That stunt guy who jumped on the building tho!
Click bait
Must you talk over everything
when talking shit and lies are too good to ban.
Skamplett Jorgensen's watery melons have been magically enhancerized in the thumnale.
Jamie Lee Curtis in True Lies !
Tits.
Dubious candidates.
Thumbnail!Don’t do this to me..😂😂
1:50 nword?
People jump from one building to another and miss: die! Buster Keaton jumping from one building to another and miss: designs the rest of the gag around the mistake!
some bloopers, much improv. but improv aint blooper
The second i heard wolf of wall street i was hoping it was the very first scene
4:14 I thought the water throw wasn't scripted
fun fact my uncle Fred Gabourie was the lead stuntman for Buster Keaton and worked with him almost daily! He also coordinated a lot of Buster’s stunts, so some of that clip may very well have been choreographed by my uncle!
the amount of times I've replayed Ron falling of the couch 🤣
Good job photoshopping ScoJo's breasts bigger for the thumbnail.
U missed the 'king kong ain't got shii on me' scene
1:51 bro
1:51 arnoldschwarts who!!
YEAH.... AHA... I FORGOT TO PUNCH OUT WASNT IN THE SCRIPT YET THE SECOND CAMERA METICULOUSLY POSITIONED TO CATCH THE PUNCHING? YEAH RIGHT!
nooo clee arrr wessles
tripe
1:53
im sorry,  Arnold Schwarze what ?
"Our mom said our dad is a real sex machine." "My dad is a gynecologist and he looks at vaginas all day long." WTH have the parents of these kids been telling them?
Arnold Schwarze-WHAT?
WHY CANT YOU LET THE BLOOPERS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES....
Robin Williams "fuck the shrimp" is priceless!  Bless him.
“F#ck the shrimp!!” 😂
Clickbait
Die Hard? If it was, I don't remember that scene at all.
😂😂😂😂💕💕💕
Dude you have a real problem. Seek help. When they ask what is wrong with you, explain what you do to your thumbnails images.
Thanks for the info !
ข.ข😮ขค
Why did u make Johanssons boobs bigger in the thumbnail? Ohh to make people watch it okay got u
I think your ST 4 was a little off........the "official" story goes that they were filming "guerilla-style," with the actors wearing hidden microphones, sort of like a Candid Camera of its day. The police officer was a real police officer hired to help with traffic and locking down the set. But the people stopped, or at least the ones Chekov and Uhura attempted to stop, were actual pedestrians. This lady didn't know (or at least at the moment did not recognize) the actors. So she just gave a sarcastic remark and left. Roddenberry and those around him had her stopped, explained to and then fortunately willingly sign the paperwork to get her paid and get her line into the movie. The story of her car being impounded is alleged to be true, although I'm not sure where you would find that source. The story of what I just wrote in them stopping real pedestrians I believe comes from both IMDB and various convention stories told over the years.
1:53 Arnold what
5:53
Confederate re-enactors??
half of these are just improv, not bloopers
The first scene the cut is super bad cause she didn't look angry or pissed before the cut 😂
Coarse.
Colin Jost is one of the luckiest dudes on the planet.
Even if this movie ends up being bad, it'll be fun bad. And we can only hope this is like suicide squad where James Gunn saves it next time around🙏
Under the Skin does NOT count as "bloopers".
1:53
1:54
Honestly that cigarette flick to the face would've pissed me of too like WTF 😂😂
1:53 arnold who?
Other notable s: Jack Nicholson came up with the line “Here’s Johnny!” Himself and Kubrick kept it in. In the film, Alien the actors didn’t know the chest bursted was going to come out of the chest. The actors were genuinely shocked and Ridley Scott wanted genuine shock and that’s just what he got from the actors on set- Bloody shock.
So much fun!
Some of these might be true.
ARNOLD WHO? 😂 great video
No Leonardo Dicaprio smashing the cup until bleeding for real? 12 years of slaves??? Why?
❤
05:21, how sincere
Old timey stunt men were crazy! 😮
7:28 if only Scarlet seduced me into there. I would be so fucking nervous but then again I would immediately ask if it was her. 😂 she’s my favorite
1:06  En ese entonces pensábamos "qué bien le sale estar enojado y repartir golpes" 😊
If Joaquin Phoenix randomly decided to punch that machine, why would they have a close up shot of it, all framed and compositioned properly? I call bs
"Entering Bilbo's hobbit hole"
Wtf is a blooper? Is that an American fauzfunni?
If there is something that I've learned from this video,  that anything beyond 2013 is a  flop
“Yeeeah”
Will Smith often lashes out like that when he's not happy
My fave is Viggo Mortensen kicks a helmet in Two Towers and falls to his knees screaming in pain because he actually broke his toe.  I feel sorry for his toe but that scream, oh man, it was just so real.
@ItzzKish Youre the kind of toxic anime fans sapping the fun out of anime for so many. Constantly defending and praising the s-it outta the most toxic laughable pathetic animme, you do it all and you do it well. Just take for example your statement about the beeeest feeemale cast EVERRR! The female cast of MK is so much r/manwritingwoman theres literally a stunningly laughable season-finale saying 'Polygamy is good. Lemme use it as a reward for my MC cause im a very twisted person and this is MY manga, i do whatever i want'
Alec Baldwin rust scene was also gonna be included..
America has a corrupt cop problem
1:52 arnoldshwortsni-
Harry Porra 😂
1:51  Arnold Schwarza-WHAT NOW  edit: to those of future comments, its a joke, relax
Who remembers when bloopers were good enough by themselves and didn't need a fucking narrator to explain them to us? lol
at least Chris Pratt could had practice a few times how to drop something "by accident"
People are so crazy 😂😂😂 I love it!!!
1:53 Arnold WHO? lmao
Don't forget Legasov dropping the plates in the Chernobyl trial, which really symbolised how the reactor "dropped a balance plate" and exploded. It was actually a blooper
“I can’t see a thing in this helmet!” Where was that line from Star Wars?
Those breast’s are beautiful
lmao thats not how you pronounce Arnold's last name. But im okay with it.
Alec is for real😶
Improv and bloopers are two different things. Some of these are improv
Arnold Swartzi-what?
some of these are ridiculous. There's no way they are improvised.
Wow.  Never heard of any of that before now.    No big deal.  Very selective viewing.  We don't get any TV channels here.
1:53 🤨
I imagine the disappointment finding out ScarJo was just flirting with me for a movie. Like, at that point I'd rather just have an alien liquefy me.
such a lucky guy can be seduced by scarlet johanson
If actors and actresses are instructed to improvise  It’s not a blooper!
1:52 SIR YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SAY NEGGAR
_Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure_ 👌
some of these are just fully not true hahahaha
We or I need more series
What's your hobby? "Confederate Reenactor" 🫠
That was so much fart 🥵
I'm sorry, but the most memorable scene in the wolf of wall street, is without any shadow of doubt, Margot robbie in a doorway.
07:29
most of them are bullshit, it's obvious... dont be too naive the fart in mistery men, that's even the power of the dude, same goes with Knight's tale, it's not that they dont speak english, he's just too high lvl of a poet for them to understand, all the kids are obviously reading a board... and it goes on and on, stop pulling content out of your lying asses, it's boring and insulting to your audience...
When Ian McKellen hit his head in the movie, my first reaction was "that must've been real and unintentional".
There is also in american psycho the scene where Patrick Bateman was going to kill Paul Allen he did a little dance it wasnt planned but it made the scene way cooler
the thumbnail gave scarlett an upgrade lmao
they impounded her car bc they decided they wanted to film there, where people have to live their lives. thats bullshit
3:20 that horse is a real actor, amazing self-control.
Imagine Scarlett Johansson picking you up in a van and flirting with you....
most of the scenes were on purpose, but you want views and subscribers
6:16 alright alright alright
Whoa I didn't know Scarlett Johansson's breast is that huge on thumbnail 😍❤️
BS.
No way that trip by Julie Andrews was way too perfect for her character. I remember dancing and singing that song and always doing the tripping motion as part of the choreo. Made me love her and knowing it wasn't even intended makes me love her even more now.
Yall really photoshopped her chest for the thumbnail. Wtf. Shame on yall.
I don't think Stephen Baldwin had a good time shooting the usual suspects, you know with the cigarette cherries to the eye and Kevin Spacey constantly trying to molest him
RIP Will Smith 🪰
In Forrest Gump actor Tom Hanks soils the towel, but they kept the scene going 😂😂
no Aragorn helmet kick?
So much of this is untrue and provably false.
I don't know how you could have made so interesting a subject so clinical and boring, unless you were doing it on purpose.
So many lies.
6:06 Robin almost lost it too
The fart inside a telephone both was terrific. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
That was NOT the most memorable scene in Wolf Of Wall Street lol
The one from the lego movie was funny for me 😂
Also the scene in Zoolander with David Duchovny, where Ben Stiller accidentally says his line again and Duchovny adlibs, “You serious? I just told you that...” One of the best jokes in the movie.
as if the helicopter could see code 4, fucking stupid
Nice bloopers in thumbnail
That Knights Tale one absolutely feels scripted XD the fact it’s seriously just lost in translation followed by a genuine cue feed is freaking marvelous
Man , Scarlett Johanson luring men into a van is maybe how I'd die
"Here's Johnny!" was not scripted either. Kubrick left it in.
President Biden has one of these everyday 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why did you edit the thumbnail?
Kicking that horse in the face is what really won Leo that Oscar 💀
She wasn't a Navy Medics, She's a Hospital Corpsman.
In season 2 of The Umbrella Academy, the elevator scene shows Luther (Tom Hopper) farting. This was scripted, but if you look in the back of the elevator you see Diego, (David Castaneda) start to laugh and put his head down. This was a blooper kept in the final episode!
Keeping these bits in just makes the movies more real which is why they are favourites
Remember when Leo DiCaprio was doing this movie with Samuel L Jackson and Quentin Tarantino and during a scene, broke a wine glass effectively severing his hand from his arm. Leo, ever the consummate professional that he is, never once cried out or broke character and finished the 30 minute scene. Later he went to the Redi-Med clinic where they gave him some aspirin and a bandaid and told him to quit being such a whiny bi***
The evil dead one is a perfect example of how some great visual art is created by accident
7:07 EXCUSE ME WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT
There's a difference between a blooper and improv
Did you know that in LOTR Two Towers when Aragon kicks the Helmet, actually Viggo Mortensen did...
That ended very abruptly
"Matthew McConaughey was actually high"... Ok? That's not a blooper, that's method acting.
I liked this video just seeing the couch blooper from harry potter
NO ONE voted for rishi sunak . Hes a nasty little rich con man . Nothing more..........
WOW the channel owner photo shopped her to make them look bigger. I swear people are such scum now days. What a horrible human.
Id rather have you not explaining anything and simply watch the video without any disturbance...specially with your voice on of the song on top of the scene natural sound 💀
doesnt that make scarlet just a regular ....ehh, nevermind
Maybe 2 of these are bloopers. The are improvisations.
Will smith part.
Thr Gandalf one I do not believe.
Seriously they have to blank out the word explosion this is ridiculous
Most of actors and singers are just channels of demonic angels or spirits, if you understand.
4:00 Only blooper that made me laugh! 😆
BS
Blind people can read, you know. Stuff can be written down, kid. Braille.
no humans or animals have been.... wait a minute
That's why gandalf hitting his head was so damn funny!
1:08 “and keep my wife’s name out of your damn alien mouth!” 👽
The Joker one is obviously bullshit because there’s already a camera pointed at the machine.
Ah yes, ye olde "clocking in machine".
boob photoshop for the thumbnail, bravo my friend, you got me haha classic
Dog soldiers, old mate actually gets punched.
and yet the machine is right in the middle of the screen  and the actor off to one side
Editing scarlets chest in the thumbnail is messed up.
The end of Captain Philips is the only worth while part.
Someone doesn't know the difference between a blooper and an adlib or improvisation.
Harrison Ford had a Joe Biden look on his face there
I believe the entire scene in Caddyshack with Chevy Chase and Bill Murray was unscripted/ad lib.
1:53 🧐
Morgan freeman says some gibberish boom it becomes a line
"Under the skin" has the highest views in this video. Damn!
I can’t be the only one who heard Arnold swhwartsnigger 😂
I'm so happy you included Mystery Men! That movie is so good but gets  no attention
NO WAY THIS GUY ENLARGED THE WOMANS BOOBS ON THE COVER OF THE VIDEO FOR MORE VIEWS 😂😂😂
Calling absolute bullshit on the Joker scene being improvised.
That’s a better list of movies than most supposedly good lists of movies to watch.
"I could have been in a barbecue with baldie and her lovers !"
1:53 arnold what 😭
One small but important correction: there were NO MEDICS in "Captain Phillips!"  There are no medics in the US Navy-the enlisted medical personnel are Hospital Corpsman.  Medics are in the Army and Air Force.  The difference?  Corpsman are trained more broadly, can serve independently, and are in the only strictly enlisted Corps in all of the uniformed services.
Source: Trust me bro.
2:02 Yeah, sure thing that wasn't scripted. Basically every child says stuff like that when describing their fathers.
I don't believe the 'time to punch out' one was un-scripted. The camera angle is too convenient, there is no reason for him to keep punching expecting it to break off the wall, and there was no reason for it to break off so easily. Fake news if you ask me.
"It ended up being Peter Quill's only hilarious moment" fixed it for ya
6:20 im dead
Gandalf entering Bilbo’s hobbit hole.  You are saying that wasn’t in the script?  Not surprised.
Most actors: "I improvised a line and they kept it in the movie" Buster Keaton: “I fell off a building, let’s write a joke around that”
Paul rudd being such an alpha with those farts.
1:53 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
No one out here is talking about the clearly photoshoped thumbnail?
Paul Muni in I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang?
I come across this video far and in between.  I Crack up every time.
Phoenix's clockkng out scene Had the perfect camera set up from 2 angles Didn't look like that was improvised.
Everyone only clicked because of tits
😂😂😂  alien BBQ
Tough night...needed a 😅 ! Ty
arnald shwarchni- what
oh a freaking lit cigarettes in the eye must hurt
Imagine getting divorced because you had a shot with Scarlett Johansson
1:50 what
Lol..after hearing bout this fact at  6:14 , it really wouldn't surprise me if McConaughey really WAS Woody Harrelsom's  "weed guy" as he put it in a SNL hosting episode. Oh, and Al Leong is LEGEND!  🙌✊
Look how they photoshopp johansson’s boob for click bait
He was just derp well injecting those farts into the bed
idk how kicking a horse in the face its "too good to cut" (?
"We walk in the garden of his turbulence" nah. I speak English but have zero idea what he means. 😅
Props to Jake Gyllenhaal for knowing LAPD code
will smith suck and Star wars suck
Gay being a privileged position is damn right, well in their mind. Seeing as how they are entitled as fuck.
7:24 if that was a man instead, it would be a crime
"Nuclear Wessels" LMAO! Also way to go out your way and find the lowest quality clips you could get a hold of.
No "Hey Malkovich think fast"???? For shame.  https://youtu.be/0ILf_4Kq0Mo
you didn't put. "Why is Gamora"
the cig wasn't actually lit dude.
Code 4 is crazy
Gee! Punching out! How original! I wonder if Phoenix ever saw "Breaking Away" from 1979?
Mark Addy rules!!!
2:50 Czechia mentioned yay
Girls fart on guys all the time especially during sex lol
And then there's the scene where a camel spits on Bob Hope in 'Road to Morocco". https://youtu.be/RtXjqPavcA0?t=120
I aspire to be Chauser from A Knight's Tale. The charisma! He had both audiences captured. THE ONE! THE ONLY! _SIR ULLLLLLLLRIC VON LICHTENSTEEEIN!_
The men in Under the Skin hadnt seen many films if they didnt recognise Scarlet Johansson.
@3:06 “The crew were not amused…” Huh? None of them? Not one? I call bullsh-it.
@1:10 The alien must not have kept Captain Hiller’s wife’s name out of its fuc-king mouth.
1:50
That scene from A Knight's Tale is wild lmao
Gandalf hitting his head looked and felt real I feel very validated in confirming this
Farts are so intrusive
wait so then in the canon of independence day is that smell coming from the alien's dead body or from the salt lake shrimp
7:06 omg he fell for real! what a great actor!
8:14 / 8:14
*FFS, dude* George C. Scott's trip and somersault in "Dr. Strangelove"; war room "...he'll see the big board!" scene.
Arnold Schwarzenegger…
This guy got millions of view just taking some random scenes and claiming they are improv. Genius. Could you please provide any proof that any of what you said is actually true?
"Entering Bilbo's Hobbit hole" just sounds wrong for some reason
There are too many funny kept Bloopers in the MCU movies
i dont care.  im getting in the car with Scar Jo
"didn't understand the cue to cheer"? that seems unlikely. it's a dude hollering in a tournament location and raising a dude's arm. that's universal
So not bloopers then
Dude that code four flash was pretty badass
Forgot the one with the Stormtrooper hitting his head on the top of the door
Now I know so many new movies I wanna watch!
If Scarlett Johansson pulls up in my wee Scottish village in a van, I am going in. Sorry mum, x
7:29 Men not recognizing Scarlett. Yeah, ok
What is the name of the intro song?
the joker one obviously isn't true there's a camera change in the middle
I thought Scarlett was Billie eilish 😭
What about the walking scene with Dustin Hoffman & John Voight in Midnight Cowboy? One of the best in movie history!
Wait.. they included the chest beating from wolf of Wall Street but not when di caprio accidentally cvts his hand open and smears ‘it’ on and actresses face in the name of improv
'scuse me
Did Buster Keaton use a green screen like they do in comic book movies?
I hope the Horse was ok 😢😢😢😢
1:51 Arnold shwarts WHAT!?
arnold schwarze who?
00:20 was not in the script.. but the. Cameraman was as always was prepared for him to hit that thing.
dont use fake thumbnail fuking garbage man
Why’d you blow up Scarlett’s chest for the thumbnail?  You don’t mess with perfection.
Great video! Except for Will Smith. He ruins everything.
😁🤣@ 3:26 😂😁It's not only that he fell off so unexpected, it's also the funny sound he makes while falling.🤣😂😁
Improvisation or going off script are not bloopers. Bloopers would be unintentional accidents where the scene is otherwise scripted and going to plan, very few of these are that. Bill Murray falling is a blooper, but are Robin Williams' fall or Dustin Hoffman's fart even bloopers if they move immediately into improv?
Did you made Scarlett Johansson breast bigger just for the thumbnail?
6:24 LMFAOOO
Blooper is different from adlib, no?
Locked in a phone booth with Dustin Hoffman's fart... disgusting 🤢🤮
A lot of this is made up. Do you really think those twin girls unscripted said in sync that their mom says their dad is a sex machine?
So much of this is absolute bullshit. This is what you have to look forward to for the rest of your lives new age people. I'm sorry
i want a followup video stating which one of these were made up or actually true
CZECH REPUBLIC MENTIONED 🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿
2:45 HELL YEA
I love how the script use reddit title and didnt change it
From 2:07 his clothes is almost like Andy Barkley from 1989 Child’s Play 2
In Wolf of Wall Street, during that chest beating scene, there’s a brief moment where you can see Leo aka Jordan glance off to the other direction briefly. This was Leo looking over at Martin Scorsese to get a sense of whether he should stay in character and go with it or not.
That wasn’t a Navy medic ‘treating’ Tom Hanks. The Navy doesn’t have medics, they have Corpsmen. She was an Independent Duty Corpsman to be specific.
That thumbnail is a LIE! 😂😂
Watch the leather maaaan 😂😂😂
1:04 it was indeed, very funny 😂😂😂 3:20 OMG I'm dying 🤣🤣🤣 poor horse
Courtney Cox was so hot...❤
So theres a load of poor blokes lured into a van thinking they were gonna have sex with Scarlett Johansson ?
Confusing Harrison Ford? Just another day at the office...
😂😂 this just made my day. Couldn't stop laughing
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂the kiiiiiiids!!
ok the code 4 part is pretty cool
1:52 ARNOLD WHAT
Breaking away had a punching the clock scene. Jackie Earle Haley was too funny.
That Kindergarden Cop scene came from real responses? That f's me up a little bit Haha
Scarlet Johansson u bad  Because wth😂😂
I haven't laughed that hard in possibly years..
Any FromSoftware Soulslike Swap area ever.
Why is her chest photoshopped in the thumbnail?
1:53
“Excuse me”
I can't believe that Hugh Jackman actually gets away with body shaming Ryan Renalds like that 😅 Some people say he's actually good-looking 😂
Woman:”Dont fart at the bed!” Man: “its the springs!” Woman: “thats why we never have sex!”
Internet: What's the difference between a blooper and an ad-lib?   TheLaughPlanet: Difference??
I love how Depp sang about the jar of dirt and fell in The Dead Man's Chest xdd
I don't believe you
Those guys followed Scarlett for real?! What the f...! 😵 Creepy guys! Hope they got reported afterwards.
1:53
7:07 how did they film this???
I pray for healing from our real life bloopers that were traumatizing. And God thank you sooooo much for the hilarious moments. I know that you work all things together for the good. 😊
Blessings in an abundance of the faith. I salute you. Grace and peace be unto you and to this place. God bless you. 🤍🤍🤍🌈🌈🤍🤍🤍. Thank you. Will you believe and receive Jesus Christ as your LORD and personal saviour??? I do. 🤍
Excuse me? What is his name?
The fact that the kindergarten cop lines are authentic makes it soooo much funnier 😂😂😂
All of these movies were GOAT material
1:52 crazy
What the heck is a nuclear wessel?
The way they keep in character is true acting. Memorizing a script is easy.
Lolololol..I KNEW Bill Murray falling wasn't on purpose. Lol
Thought that thumbnail was edited...
Some of these accidents are not accidents, but improvs! Talented actors selling the bit.
😂😂 it's the springs, he says!
Some of these were definitely scripted
This is phenomenal
Yeah, there's no way heaven these Kindergarten Cop kids' lines weren't scripted. At least not the ones in this video.  I guess the whole thing is made up.
Ah, independence day, such a great movie.  And I can’t watch it anymore since I have boycotted will smith until he gives a real apology to Chris rock, and not that half apology he tried to give on social media.
That cigarette flick is one of the funniest moments in cinematic history.
wasn't the dog biting Sol's arse in Snatch also a blooper? I think that one deserved to be in here
6:22 okay that made me laugh, mathew being high for real was too funny :D
hey, is jack nicholson's fart in the bed in Anger Management scripted??? I always thought it wasn't, Adam Sandler genuinely his to hold back his laughter
when i saw under the skin and scarlett takes off her clothes i thought my brain would pop, ... the impossible that was about to happen ... i never thought she would show anything it was a miiracle that was to never be...
Arnold sportsa whattt
Man those are really great! Thanks for sharing this info!
If you haven't seen Under the Skin, it's quite a ride.
Punching out is effing hilarious...!!
Can someone please point smthng I can use as this “peel off”  she used? Maybe glue?
can't believe they didn't include the "caw!" on the last clip.  I'm disappointed.
Not gna lie,i wldve gotten into scarlett's van too..and said,"so we doing avenger s*** or u wanna just get crazy" lol 😂
Joaquin is unbelievable 🎉
most of those are clearly scripted
McConahey's acting ritual of beating on his chest being in the scene was Leo's idea.
yeah the super famous line: scuse me everyone knows that one
I was laughing so hard at work ....with tears flowing down my face when the lego part come up. (Rewind it back 3x)🤣
7:53 the hole movie is sucking off a real criminal who fuuuucked millions over but that chest goofy thing is LEGIT THE MOST TARDED SHIT EVER PUT ON FILM
5:10 something about Gandalf entering Bilbo his hobbit hole
The Boogie nights Lil Bill ass in her cock line have to be Ab lid no way it was written that way lol!
End of Watch is excellent...
3:42 yo what is this list?
2:49 what?
2:05 they are clearly reading from cue cards.
air silence is deadly ... except where needed. It was really needed at 2:50
I don’t think that any line from Mystery Men is “Famous”.
F - - - the shrimp
Poor Bill Murray
🥰💯👏
Han Solo's face  🤣🤣🤣
dead brine shrimp
This was very interesting..thanks so much!
2:07
Bill Murray should just improv all his lines really
You forget that part in pirates of the caribbean where Johnny Depp says ‘I’ve got a jar of dirt’
1:52 I heard that bro🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Robin Williams was one of the funniest scenes ever
yea sure. so happen they got another camera angle on the unintended blooper
You include Dustin Hoffman, but not THE most famous blooper - as Rizzo Razzo in Midnight Cowboy (1969) he's out of character when a New York cab nearly runs him over!
1:53 Schwarzen- What?
" 'Scuse me."  Already a funny line, but to learn that it was improvised due to a 'near miss' makes it even funnier.
_"The clocking-in machine?!"_ Damn...I need a nap, you damn kids and your made-up terms. Help me, lord.
1:52 what?????
props to the lady for becoming an extra just to stick it to the assholes who impounded her car.
2:03 AYYYEEEE YOOOOOOO 💀 💀 💀
0:28 - Uh-huh. So why was the 2nd camera set up if it was unplanned?
How did they not laugh in Rainman with that phone booth fart??
2:45 CZECHIA MENTIONED??? ŘÁÁÁÁHHHHH
Moral of the story, if you bloop stay in character. You never know, it might just get used.
I call bullshit on 90% of these claims.
Props to that lady with the car
Wolf of Wall Street,  it was intentional, Leo saw Matthew's warm up before he goes on screen and recommended they include it in the film
I feel bad for the horse that got kicked in the face.  It didn't deserve it.
“Nuclear wessels.” Nicely done.
Hey Laugh Planet, how did you not include the greatest Hollywood blooper of ALL TIME? "Midnight Cowboy" scene where Dustin Hoffman was nearly struck by a taxi cab. https://youtu.be/c412hqucHKw
So the girl twins didnt have a script. they just plain said their father is a sex machine????
Knight's Tale was good one 😂
I have lots of silly accidents that are unscripted, and i'm not an actor. I should get paid.
0:50
The Rain Man scene here had me laughing. I'm immature.
Scrooged part is funny haha. First i tought he was james Belushi, they are real look a likes. Nice done for a none actor in Startrek IV. Give her a contract :)
come on nigel , get Donald over to help too
The Star wars one is stupid, why would Han be confused? Bad direction
Wasn`t the biggest blooper in Wolf of Wallstreet, the pact that it was made in the first place. Pretty sure it was made with stolen money.
“Fk the shrimp 🦐 “ that’s something I’d say lol
Some of these aren't bloopers. They're adlibs
Good vid ty
Watch the leather maaan😂😂😂
Someone asked the horse if that kick in the face hurt ....he said nay😐
@BigTugg at 2:08 in Kindergarten Cop. Is this you!?
so you say
TBF, if Scarlett Johansson was luring me into a van , Id get in too.
I love how actors have that gut feeling to go along with it and it ends up being a master piece.
7:05 Excuse me what now??
Please don’t show Will Smith. He’s still on my shit list and probably will be for life.
7:06 Buster Keaton - the real deal.
bloopers only exist becouse the director or script writer didnt   address it to the actor for credit...um if your in a house  thats made very small you dont need it to be scripted for the actor charector to hit his head
Matthew McConnigay is just a weird dude man
5:03 Gandalf is basically an immortal angel for the god of light but still gets hurt when he bonks his head lol
I just wanted to say jesus loves you he's changed my life and all the better he can change yours to because he loves you and died for your sins come to him and be saved and experience his love he'll always be by your side embrace christ as he wishes to know you god bless
Did not see any of 'em.
4:10 blind people can write and read
Wow Disney starwars is worst every time another failure is found
That’s some stupid bullshit. That 3 minutes I’ll never get back
"That made him interesting."    I think it takes a real talent to improv so well it fits seamlessly.  In Three Men and A Baby, after Tom Selleck puts a diaper on Mary he lifts her up. The diaper fell accordingly but then the baby peed. He managed to stay in character and I think it was really cute.
3:15 Americans never make love, it's just 'sex', there's no morals no respect, sex to an American has no meaning...
I got click baited by edited thumbnail 😂
1:52 did i hear that right?
1:54 did i hear that right?
7:22...Yeah, Scar Jo pulls up in a van & asks me to get in. KIDNEYS BE DAMNED...I'M TOTALLY IN THERE😂
Lake stink from the Great Salt Lake is no joke. It's barf worthy. Imagine dead, rotting fish cuz it's dead, rotting brine shrimp (krill). Lived in SLC for 15 years.
Real sex machine? Thank god their just repeating it and not knowing what it is
That was a video.
There's a big difference between improv and bloopers.
Okay youtube I watched the video! ARE YOU HAPPY?
I didn't know why my heartrate elevated, but then I noticed that the background music of this video is the music from the Overkooked game. That explains the instant stress and the urge to hurry up 😁
Improvisation is different than bloopers. Many of these were just scripted improv.
Nice video, but bloopers and ad-libs/improv are two different things.
The C.Philippines scene is not a blooper
lmao
2:30 LOL!!!
@6:43 In Captain Phillips, this scene was an incredibly amazing acting scene by Tom Hanks. He played it as if it was real. Amazing!
0:55 I don't think its will smith cuz if it was him then he would have said :  " keep your damn smell out of my fucking nose! "
I hope that horse never forgot Leo and took a bump in front of his trailer 😒
The scene from captain philips was the scene I remebered the most. Being someone who has panic attacks, I never related to a character being overwhelmed like that.
background music is ass
John malkovich being hit by can not oncluded.
Another one from Scooged - when the Ghost of Christmas Present smacks Bill Murray with the toaster - she really did hit him with it, broke his nose in the process, and that clip was the one that you see.
Why do they call them bloopers instead of mistakes?
the slip in scrooged is legit
Turn off the fracking narrator.
I fart in bed
In Spiderman 2, When tobey was filming a scene he watched the train passing by, then he jumped in front of the train and said to Raimi "yooo, come over here and film this thing man".
End of watch code 4??? 🙄 Yeah cos the pilot can see 4 fingers of the cop on the ground from the helicopter 🤣
8 MILLION VIEWS, less than 110K thumbs up= suckage.
*FART...FART.* 😂😂😂
I really don't believe 70% of these.
This message is to those who are listening.  This is going to be right to the point. I went to heaven, this being was talking to Mother Goddess. This being called her Yah de Mah, I asked God what did that mean Goddess said Queen of Heaven. God and Goddess showed me Shiva & Vishnu (man) Buddha, Now they are telling that Yah means Queen. All of these Deities we are worshiping and suppose to be worshiping  is a (one) Female Goddess I don't care if you don't believe me SEEK GOD WE'VE BEEN LIED TO.  GOD IS NOT SITTING NEXT TO ANOTHER KING IN HEAVEN as the KING of Heaven. He is not going to do that then tell us NOT to. Jer. CH 33 v 16- 17 Jer ch. 44 v 17 ,18 ,19, 25 read carefully.
6:28 I know that medic.  She and her family used to go to my church.  If you ask her to tell the story about being in a movie with Tom Hanks, she lights up and tells the story, even if it the 8 millionth time some asks her to share it.  lol
0:49 -LOL
this ved seems lowkey like a lie, no cap
The ending of this video wasn't planned... it just happened.
Ohhhhh an actor ad lived, and they kept it in the movie wow. You mean they acted because they’re being paid to act  smh
5:22  Big brain power!!
arnold who????
@6:13 that actor beside Matthew McConaughey will never not be that vampire in the 90's movie Buffy the vampire slayer.
Clickbait thumbnail that scene isn't even in this compilation.
2:07
Credit Goes to the Thumbnail Editor who just finely enlarged her boobs just a teeny tiny bit bigger so they actually attract people to click on the video.  bravieeee
1:52 lol
4:46 The fact he was out of frame far too long made me suspect this was a goof-up.
For Morgan Freeman as Vetruvias, THE BLIND CAN READ OF YOU WRITE IN BRAILLE😂
I hate these.  Id say 90% of these are actually in the script. Ron falling off the couch how could that not be in the script.
I agree, “Bye”. I wish them deeper insights into their own cowardice and selfishness ( both of which are the 2 halves of the he same apple ). Keep on keeping on Alana❤❤❤❤❤
I got rid of my leather furniture when I got my cat.... I named him Wooderson.... Woody for short. LOVE DAZED AND CONFUSED
It's amazing how many iconic scenes are improvised.
Leo and Mathew's seen was NOT the most memorable scene in Wolf of Wall Street!
Oh the brine shrimp, they life but one summer. Hummer bummer.
😂😂😂😂😂
That horse is a real pro.
no way that Julie Andrews trip wasnt on purpose; you can see her prepare and lean into it right before it happens
So Gandalf hits his head, and the camera is just there by accident, right?
😂
No way they didn't recognize Scarlett Johnson
pee wees "excuse me"
Gandalf banging his head in Bilbo's hobbit hole; I'm glad Peter kept it in. 😊
This is really great.
Fascinating.
Of course the woman who answered wasn't an actor. She would have been an **actress**. Because that is what females who act are called.
Our mom say our dad is real sex machine 😂😂😂😂
UGH seeing and hearing Will Smiths voice did it for me. Lost all interest. He is disgusting tiny lil man-child.
Clickbait. The thumbnail does not appear in the clip.
Joaquin stole that from Breaking Away. Wow, I’m old.
3:32 that was all well and good, except for the fact that Ron was not really that strong of a character in the movies compared to the books. The scene further degreaded Ron character.
That scene from Captain Philips is INCREDIBLE!  Left me stunned!
1:57  Herschel Wingrod Predator Producer.
FINALLY!!!!! Some new bloopers I’ve never seen
I always thought that jacket scene with Chewbacca was some kind of foreshadowing and had some kind of plot significance that we would find out about in the next episode.
Great video.  I have to say, though, The most memorable scene in "Wolf of Wall Street" was with Margot Robbie.  You know the one.
I just came for Scarlett 😍
Thats not the most memorable scene in WoWS😏
That scene from Captain Philips is so great.
ok tom hanks is amazing in that ambulance, that just few seconds and i can tell that is one of the best actors alive
There was the scene in Guardians of the Galaxy 1 where Sean Gunn laughs when Yondu is talking gibberish to the shopkeeper. It was kept in because it was too good
i dont believe the scarlett part. hidden cameras? cinema quality hidden cameras and the dudes agreeing to it? sure.
Scuse me is a phrase created by Paul rubin wow never knew that. Did you know that the hangover created hangovers
Gandalf wasn't playing....
I still don't believe that the punching (out) of the machine was improvised on the spot, since it's been filmed from two separate angles or, simultaneously, with two cameras. That doesn't happen by pure coincidence, that needs to be carfully planned and staged. But it's a great scene, nevertheless! ;-)
Most are probably lies but it's a good story
THERE ARE NO NAVY "MEDICS"!!  They are called "corpsmen".  Accuracy matters.
Rainman is such a great movie.
Like if you came here for scarlet
"Confusing Harrison Ford" - that seems to be his default mode, stoned and confused
Those Buster Keaton films that are 100 years old now were amazing. This was way before stuntman or any of the safety protocols there are now. It’s amazing to see what Buster put his body through.
duuuude the 2:55 segment WAS hilarious. What a good idea to keep it in. Half of the other ones I haven't seen the movies, but Ty for this. Ah yes Guardians was neat. It really did add to the "character's" clumsiness xD
True definition of when my art teacher told me, "the mistakes can make people like it better sometimes "
In the US, Donald Trump, a TV clown who had a once successful reality show, became a Presidential Candidate merely as a joke. He never intended to win; let alone be the POTUS for real. Yet, here we are in this B-rated show still.
I was an extra in a movie (the devil's violinist) and got an unscripted line in. I was supposed to be handed a pen by an actor, but in one take he overlooked me, so I asked "may I have a pen", and that was the scene that made it into the movie. Not very exciting or original, but it got me a close-up!
This should be called...  FARTS, FALLS,  & FOLLYS
what makes me question this is that mostly there is only one camera that films one thing, not like 2 -3 angels at once. So... not sure if this is a wish believe made-up stuff or if they really had many cameras at once.
scarlet made them dirty
Nah stop the cap. There no way “Our mom say that our dad is a real sex machine “ wasn’t a script 🤣
Joaquin Phoenix improvised the punching out joke. Good thing they had that low angle camera already focused on the clock to catch the improv.
During the end credits of Star Trek IV there is a montage of clips from throughout the movie shown.  However if you look closely, there's a clip of James Doohan (Scotty) trying to climb out the ship but slips on the ladder and falls into the water. This footage isn't in the movie itself but was rather cheekily hidden in the end credit footage montage 😂
A lot of these definitely seemed planned
Most memorable scene in wolf of wallstreet? Y’all watched different movie than I did
Like every middle-management sc*mbag you've ever had to work or communicate with. The smarm, the vacuousness, the ineptness. It's almost as every politian allowed to run and lead these days is designed to fail.
Keir Stalin
I can't believe the Breaking Bad pizza toss isn't here.  I mean I know it's not a movie but still xP
If punching the clock off the wall was a blooper or an ad lib, why are there two camera angles?
hilarious
Most of these seem like bullshit. Except under the skin.
HJ loves this role, he is able to get so much anger out.
That medic scene in Captain Phillips was so real, I knew the actor must've been an actual first responder of some kind.
i did wonder about that scene with tom hanks, the doctor played it so convincingly i thought either she didn't know or she was an actual doctor used to doing demos. good for her.
So sad the busty girl didnt appear
this video is wrong alot actually oh dear....
I don't believe the Kindergarten Cop one.
If you aint seen "End of Watch" trust me you are missing out, its an amazing film!
with the first clip i thought it was going to be just funny clips like that, then come the 2nd clip you start talking... why? just let the clips play like you did the first one. now we have to sit through you explaining what we're about to watch like everyone needs everything explained to them.
THE CHEWBACA ONE KILLED ME
It was the trumpet I swear! #Iamautostick
Funny how some of the "unscripted" moments are somehow perfectly shot even though the actors changed their movements enough to need the camera to be repositioned
Got that dan bull in the background 😁
Jackie Chans fav movie of all time is "The General" (starring Buster Keaton) - that's all you need to know when it comes to "The GOAT of stunts".
If the "punch out" scene wasn't scripted, why were there two different camera angles? I would understand multiple cameras on a "battlefield" for a movie, but 2 movie camers in a small room?
Scarlett enhancement is the reason you clicked don't lie
Bro said Arnold Shwatznigga
Good video.  Very good.
Improvisation isn’t a blooper.
3:21 What the horse did to you bro?
I write screenplays as a hobby and i believe one of these, the rest are too staged.
nice thumbnail work mister photoshop ;)
nuclear what?
1:52 bro called him arnold shwar-ni**er 🫢
Call me a cynic but I don't believe any of these are true. Just more movie BS to entertain the little people, especially the Scarlett Johansson one. The men may not be actors, but you can tell that they know what's going on by the look on their faces.
Can you prove your statements? Where do you know it all from? Maybe it's all like the script stated it to be. Can't believe any of those.
1:10 Funny fact, Will Smith broke his toe when kicking the alien. His scream also was real.
The funny thing is the thumbnail had big attributes but in the actual video the attributes were not as big if you want I mean 7:30
Bottom Line: Farts are always funny. 😅🙌
Like tears in the rain
If scarlett asks me to get in a van, i am getting in the van 😊
2:06 I swear to god I thought he was trying to say cardiologist, which makes the next words out his mouth much more surprising.
6:35... Not a "blooper". 7:30... Not a "blooper".
I'm a simple man.
Cute
A few of these I don't believe were not planned but whatever. 😂
Why was there a punch clock in the clown hiring place?  Why was there a sign telling them to remember to punch in?  Is clowning a 9-5 job?
1:52  Arnold Who!?!?
Get a load of this guy. He has ENLARGED Scarlett's boobies for the thumbnail.
Scarlet lookimg like billie ellish
FUCK the Shrimp
I would of also taken the chance to fart in a phone booth while Tom cruise is stuck in there lol that's hilarious
I love brunettes and l couldn't believe how much better Scarlett looked as one.
Someone definitely made Scar Jo's boobs bigger in the thumbnail. That's hilariously sneaky
Imagine forgetting "I'm walking here!" from Midnight Cowboy.
Did anyone notice how the thumbnail and the real scene from scarlet so different.... bro edited to appear tastier
That Captain Phillips scene is devastating.
If the clock punching scene wasn’t scripted, why was there a camera pointed right at it…? Did he do it once then decide they liked the idea so set it up again & filmed the clock…?
Hi,, can you send a prayer that I can do to remove any curse on me,, or if there's a jin anything satanic demon that I can do to remove it... CAuse I try my own prayer I feel there's something never let me finish...
I am amazed that people actually still believe that bullshit about Under Her Skin. Funny how they all have multiple credits on IMDb. I guess they all caught the acting bug...and were good enough to get cast in other projects.
many directors like to use actual US military personnel in the films today. somehow you can always tell as the scenes do not play like they were acted
I'm not sure which scene it was, I think it was Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, but Draco's actor forgot a line, but he looks at one of his buddies and goes "I didn't know you could read..."
Gandalf’s forehead hit is funny whereas most forced slapstick comes across as lame and cheesy
That code 4 was badass!
Watch the video to the part about Will Smith then I stopped it. Why did you run the vid?
some of these are just false
Buster Keaton's leap was insane. It makes me wonder how many actors died before stuntmen were hired.
Also in the LOTR trilogy, Viggo Mortensen kicked a helmet thinking it was just a lightweight prop in order to act frustrated. Turns out, it was a real heavy helmet and he busted his toe so hard that he screamed out in pain and went down on his knees.
I never knew that STAR TREK IV detail before, and that woman got crazy lucky. Typically, the quickest way to get yourself fired as an extra is to improv an actual line, and rightly so. Because for one thing, all it takes is a single line in a proper studio production for you to get into the Screen Actors Guild, and of course the pay is different.
Leslie Mann is so pretty!
I’m a Navy veteran and in that hospital scene in Captain Phillips, I knew that the Corpsman treating him was a real military doctor. She was very professional and straightforward and serious. I can tell the scene was not scripted and she was not an actress.
Miss Robin Williams 😢
At happened he ran out of people to do this too. People dont just wake up like this . This is a human being that enjoys seeing bondage and torture. If the FBI went in that man home and took his laptop , phone , computer i bout bet ya you'd find some sick stuff
2:04 I literally spat my coke out of my mouth from laughter 🤣🤣🤣
No Frigging Way. 🤣
hits his head entering bilbo's hobbit hole
2:53 yeeeeeeeah 😂
Maybe 5% of these are actually bloopers and not scripted.
I think Bill Murray slipping on the water in Scrooged is one of the funniest moments in movie history.
bollocks
Harrison Ford being completely dumbfounded by improv is so Harrison Ford.
7:05 this is the most insane one
Power of thumbnail
i loved this!!!  wow!
ARNOLD SCHWARZE WHAT??????
Peter Quill had hilarious moments?
Buster Keaton:  absolute legend.
I could watch Bill Murray falling in scrooged over and over and still laugh.
Movies with scarlet Johanson, her naked scenes were unbelievable. The joker movie, he had his first ever time to be the star of the film. Loki, another creature who is NOT thors brother. This is so incredible, seriously
The Gandalf hitting head moment wasn't in the script, but it wasn't accidental, it was an improv by McKellen as he thought it would add something to the scene and to his character. It seems that he didn't tell Jackson about this, leaving Jackson believe the whole thing was accidental.
Pathetic mature thumbnail photoshopped. You desperately need to find yourself a girlfriend.
That wasn't entirely true about the lady in Star Trek IV. She just happened to be walking by. Said what she said and they had to chase her down to sign a release form to use her image in the movie
Damn I didn’t really the end of watch one wasn’t scripted
Wow..I really Don’t care about “actors”..
You missed the most famous one of all time: Badges? We Don't Need no Stink'n Badges!
"Gandolf bumps his head entering Bilbo's Hobbit hole? Use protection.
3:19 horse giving stinky eyes
Bro did NOT say schwarzenegger at 1:52
he really photoshopped her boobs to be big
"..all right you got to write all that down cuz  I'm not going to remember any of it but here we go.." - Morgan Freeman. I want that to be inscribed on my tombstone. 100%.😎
You can really tell who are professional actors when they continue until they hear cut even if they get hurt or mess up
Lol at you making Scarletts boobs bigger in the thumbnail for clicks
I read something completely different regarding the woman who told Chekov and Uhura where she thought the nuclear wessels were. I read she was out walking her dog, wasn't paying attention and ended up on the set and Nichelle and Walter had no idea she wasn't the extra. When she answered them it wasn't scripted. So which one is the truth? No Idea.
The thumbnail editing is ridiculous for a channel like this 🤦‍♂️
Yeah... cuz real men wouldnt know who Scarlett Johansson is... i call BS on that one. Shes not getting in a vehicle with strangers no one knows about
Narrator didn’t say Arnies last name right lmao 1:50
SCARLET JOHNSON!
The “This Is 40” scene is most impressive. That is disgusting. But Leslie Mann is married to Judd Apatow, so I believe she is used to this sort of behavior. 🤣🤣 A true professional.
I hate that hits on the chest!
At a bbq or a crawfish brawl hahaha
1:53 yo that's not how you say his name 😭😭
You guys really edited Scarlett's breasts to be bigger in the thumbnail?  What the fuck?
Blade Runner 'Tears in Rain' Monologue.
When they use multiple cameras with focus and correct lighting like in "I forgot to punch out" - It's not a blooper.
Excuse me? Arnold SchwarzeWHAT???
You mean to tell me a bunch of random men didn’t recognize Scarlett Johansson immediately? Very hard to believe
Joaquin has a habit of destroying sets in his films. In the Master he destroyed a toilet in a historical jail set in San Pedro. No one had the balls to tell him to knock it off.
I'm resilient  If it make it yo the final cut, then it's not a blooper
😂
@1:42 a blooper? Nah, scripted, then over acted by Harrison.
That was really good. Thank you.
the "a knight's tale" scene was perfect, just perfect.
04:20 - *NAJLEPSZE* 😎
I got pulled over by a cop and flashed a code four  Still got a ticket
why did you photoshop scarlett's  breasts in the thumbnail. that was cheap
The first one minute of this video tells you why you shouldn't watch any more. Filth.
I'm calling BS on most of these
7:50 Not shown here, but during the lunch scene in Wolf of Wall Street, Leo looks around the room at one point in bewilderment. That's actually him looking over to Martin Scorsese to gauge his reaction to McConaughey's improv.
1:52 I'm sorry i think i didn't hear that right, ARNOLD WHAT??
Yes, the Will Smith scene was not scripted, that why the camera was on the ground in next shot.
I have a theory that Bill Murray doesn't realise he's an actor in films.
Flicking a cig is not really something that's to aim.
I’ll never believe Chris Pratt didn’t drop it on purpose. I’m sure it wasn’t in the script, but he totally staged that.
Yeah. If you're an extra and you adlib a line, you're getting fired, unless the director liked it
5:07 Gandalf was entering Bilbo's "Hobbit hole"? What do you mean by that?
That was NOT the most memorable scene in the Wolf of Wall Street. 😊
So several of these were not bloopers at all. Just weird stuff that someone decided to toss in there.
Robin Williams was comedic gold
Imagine being seduced by Scarlett Johansen, and even get to see her in varying degrees of undress during shooting, lucky guys.
Scarlett Johansson can convince me to get in the van, she could be holding a bloody knife and I still would get in the van with gladness.
ty good stuff
How many of the parents of the kids from _Kindergarten Cop_ accidentally were in trouble or got a really good, if embarrassing, laugh out of it?
This video is BS
I have always wondered in the movie Die Hard when they send the swat team in if that was a blooper where one of the officers pricks himself on a thorn bush.
Bull.
Why is it that hitting heads, slipping and falling, and farting are so funny? I’m not 12 anymore, but my sense of humor doesn’t know it.
Where is Dustin Hoffman in Midnight Cowboy? That is the GOAT improvised line.
Best thing to do when you screw up, stay in character until the director calls cut. You might have made magic.
You would not have fun after Scarlett invited you for a ride. Not fun at all.
Bullshit to 90% of this AI crap sandwich.
1:52 arnold what now?
None of these were improv'd
So they just left Han solos jacket on floor even thought they were about to film scene on it?!?!😂
Have you used some kind of "AI" upscaling and/or sharpening on these cips? Some look plain horrible. Oh, and Under The Skin factoid is not a blooper, man, come on. It's stunt filming.
Arnold who? 😭
Best improv for me was still the hospital blowing up in The Dark Knight. That was a real trigger for real explosives, and Heath Ledger's real reaction when the second building didn't go off in sequence properly.
i heard star trek 4, she gave real directions, then they found out why she was there and paid her after the rfact
The last 1 he made a song and they kept it in yes he hit his chest but they kept it in
Who could possibly be gullible enough to believe those myths?! If nobody on set expected the actor to start punching the clock machine, why was the camera perfectly centered and zoomed in on the the clock?
Not sure you know what a blooper is but a fun video all the same
2:54 the best one
Junas is a real star wars fan.
Arnold Schwarze... what?😐
"My dad is a gynecologist. He looks at vaginas all day long" 🤣
Total bullshit from the start, how come the punching out clock has another camera shot already framed on it ready to catch this 'blooper'?
poor horse, it was just doing his job.
Arnold S..."who was your Daddy and what thehell did HE DO!!!"
These r the best parts.
The gynecologist kid always gets me 😂
Yea bloopers where every camera was positioned perfectly.
Steven Baldwin? Isn't that Vince Vaughn? 🤔
so even in accidental scenes, like punching the clock on wall, the cut scene perfectly centers the clock in the frame, it seems cameraman also accidentally made that choice!
men can be such creeps, I know I'm one of them! Farting is my speciality
the key to comedy seems to be slipping over and farting.
3:55, Blind people can, read and write.  It's called 'Brail'.   Where did you go to school?
LMFAO, HE INFLATED HER TITS FOR THE THUMBNAIL
They got a free helicopter for that movie you know how much a helicopter would had cost them
0:51 looks like dylan O’Brien
2:30 ×cuse mE
05:20 Why Uhura is Michael Jackson?
1:53 excuse me?
And the award for MOST DISAPPOINTED PERV AT A TRUCK STOP goes to............um, it's a 4 way tie for the movie UNDER THE SKIN
Fun fact: Leo didn't kick a real horse. It was actually a prop, made partly from the wood in the door at the end of Titanic.  Leo was so tired of being asked about the door (despite making at least 10 legendary movies since then) that he ended that phase of his life by 'kicking a dead horse.'           Nah. Just playing. He just booted it couple of teeth out of a real horse.
god dang the thumbnail
Chris Pratt dropping the orb was absolutely in character
5:26 The woman who answers wasn't an...ACTRESS, men are actors and women are actresses.
Stop talking and just play the clips
Nuclear wessels?  Is this AI voice? AI sucks
You forgot about the part where vigo Mortensen where he kicks the orc head in the helmet and he screams in pain even though it was scripted the pain he was in and that scream wasn’t he actually broke his toe in the take and they kept it in because it showed the emotion that was needing to be portrayed
In case anyone is wondering, under the skin is an absolutely terrible movie and a complete waste of time!
The scarlet johanesson one would have been dramatically different if the genders were swapped
sO MANY MISTRUTHS IN THIS.
One of my favorite episodes about improvised acting is in Ridley Scott's first movie, The Duelists. When Keith Carradine's character asks for Cristina Reines' character's hand in marriage, she is slightly embarrassed and laughs at the situation, which made the scene really natural. However, actually, she was laughing because the horse in the scene had an erection.
So let me get this straight.... KIndergarten Cop... young kids who are talking about very sexual things... is deemed alright to show... yet in SL, there is this whole controversy about "child avatars" not to be allowed next to sex beds and adult things, when they are actually adults behind the screen, as young as 16, OLDER then these child actors saying these things... I dont understand this world... at all... this bloody Karen complaining about my "bulge"... in a general area, when her boobs are flailing about... ugh... I really cant stand this broken twisted world...
Another blooper that was too good to cut was in The Last Samurai, where Tom Cruise's horse kicked an extra in the balls. I laughed when I saw it, especially since the extra staggers back in pain. Hope the guy's ok, tho. I hear a horse kick can break bones.
And the thumbnail had to be photoshoped to make it a clickbait video, right? Typical...
Under the Skin was partly filmed in a Morrisons supermarket car park in the UK
Another Baldwin accident 😕
There is no "cradle" in Speed. It's a baby carriage or pram.
What no Aragorn kicking the helmet
That is extra creepy for Scarlett Johansen
I feel like most if not all of these are BS
Arnold schwarze what? 1:51
Best scene from wolf of wall street
Imagine photoshopping Scarletts breasts in the thumbnail for the bait ...
1:44 it's pronounced more like "Yawn-ahs Suoh-tah-mo"
Please tell me not alot of people missed 7:22 💀
So Joaquin Phoenix improvised the punch out joke and they just so happened to have a second camera setup with the clocking in machine center framed? rrrrriiiiiiggghhhtttt.  Most of this video is total BS.
scarlet's jugs on thumbnail
Got to love Buster Keaton
No commentary would be better on this
Some of these are plausible, and the rest are head canon.
1:53 Arnold what?
I can assure you, chest thumping is NOT the most memorable scene from Wolf of Wallstreet.
Pure coincidence the only one with boobs is the thumbnail.
Daily Reminder: JESUS LOVES YALL ❤️ 💝💗💕💛💝💖💚💓💕❤💌💛💖💝💙💌💓💖💝💗💘
What did he say at 2:29?
I like steam trains.
Gandalf hitting his head wasnt scripted? Man it fit perfectly since he was in a hobbit hole lol, how ironic
He punched out the machine.  Get it?
and the bloopers?
Awesome Compilation🎉
As far as the revenant is concerned, still a bad attempt to make a movie about the real life story of Hugh Glass and the ordeal he faced after the grizzly attack. Definitely could have another actor portray Glass.
blind people can read?
7:24 u r welcome
This is one of the many things I love about Performing Arts:  it's a safe place where most mistakes are embraced.
I´d say some of the best jokes are the ones which aren´t scripted but in fact accidents.
Leonardo DiCaprio always improvising
Arnold who?
7:29 “It should’ve been me! Not them! It’s not fair!”
The code4 was beast. I ask myself if the camera is that good and things were not actually scripted.
Great Content 🤙🏾
Also, kurt russell destroying a priceless prop guitar in hateful eight was unscripted.
so does it mean the one kid's dad was actually a money launderer in kindergarten cop?🤔😅
Clickbait thumbnail.  Her bosoms aren't that juicy.
Lol @ "the most memorable scene in Wolf of Wall Street"  We certainly watched different versions of this film. 🤣🤣
I think someone needs to look up the difference between improve and blooper..
1:57 This is 100% made up. Miko Hughes's dad isn't a gynecologist. He was a robot maker and special effect tech for movies, and built one of the Johnny 5 robots in Short Circuit. His name is John Hughes.
Under the Skin is truly a creepy movie. It's even more so knowing the  men were just regular Irish dudes.
Leo is kicking himself on the face  ! Lol
Ok but why did you Photoshop scarlets boobs in the thumbnail :/
Wrong, most of these were written in
Thanks!👍
I still love "when the f**k did we get ice cream?" from The Ringer
My dad is a carNiologist, he looks at vaginas all day long😭💀
The fart scene with Tom cruise literally killed me 😂
I LOVE Mystery Men and this is GOLD!!++
Ok, idk the Knight's Tale extras were Czhek citizens who didn't speak English. I thought they were just hungry and tired and Chaucer's speech was improved, so they were like, "Can we leave the set and eat already?" XD
AI generated voice over, dumb, repetitive background stock music. Thanks YouTube but I think I'll pass on this low-effort suggestion.
I must have seen Mystery Men at least a dozen times and had no idea the "excuse me" part wasn't in the script. That's awesome.
*"person does something completely natural"* -Keep it in! Keep it in!
"Fuck the shrimp" from Robin Williams would of killed me.... xD
Do you not know the difference between bloopers and ad-lib?
That is far from the most memorable scene in Wolf of Wallstreet. That's actually a very cringy scene.
There is a difference between a blooper and improvisation, literally the first clip is NOT A BLOOPER but improvisation.   FCKNG ANNOYING.
There is another scene in Star Trek IV that was basially a blooper. George Takei talked about it on a convention I attended. The scene is at 42 min. 30 sec. in the movie. While walking around in SF, they pass a bar and George thought it might add authenticity if he was peeking through the window, as his character Sulu would be genuinely interested in a culture from the past. It was in the morning and he was amazed how many people were already drinking at this bar. The had to shoot several takes and he repeated his look every time. In the shot which ended up in the movie, one of the female patrons lifted her shirt and flashed George. You can see him grin as he turns away from the window. Now you know why.
"Don't forget to punch the clock, shorty!"..is from Breaking Away 1980.
One of my favourite ones is a stormtroopers bumping his head in A New Hope. They kept it in the film and even added an homage to it in Attack of the Clones where Jango bumps his head as if it was a genetic trait.
The “yeah” for the crowd que was perfect.
4:04 braille is a thing.
1:53
If the blooper made it to the movie, it's technically not a blooper
Перднуть на съемках, да еще и в кровати с очаровательной женщиной или в закрытой телефонной будке... Ну так себе культура. Можно и потерпеть. Или не жрать горох на завтрак.
It amazing that so many of these supposedly improvised scenes have the camera set up perfectly...
The End of Watch one was actually pretty cool.
"Did you fucking fart ray?"
lol it's awesome that it happened to Steve Baldwin too
1:53
The "clocking in machine"? It's called a "time clock".
Robin Williams is the king of improvs 😅😅
4:38  just to the right of center.  Is that guy black?  If so seems an off member of a Rebel army.
Fun fact about the Gandalf head bonk. While the bonk was not planned by Peter Jackson, Ian Mckellen thought it was a funny idea and did plan to do that.
The new Chewie actor is way better than the original. No disrespect.
*pauses the movie* “fun fact! This bit was actually unscripted and the actor’s reaction is genuine!”
1:52 arnold schwaz what? o.O
Alot of this is BS the joker one for example had a camera just for it.
A lot of these definitely aren't bloopers.
It's one of my top favorite movies but that story about Paul Reubens is such bullsh*t I'm sorry.   No lighter in the history of time has exploded in a miniature rolling fire plume.
Hardly any of these weren't scripted. Actors just claim this because they know they are little more than performing monkeys.
Haha
These aren't bloopers
Absolutely DYING watching these
Imagine getting hit on by Scarlett...no man would ever refuse to get in her van :(
In The Return of the King, the Rohirrim showing up at Gondor and charging at the orcs wasn't scripted and just happened by accident, but they kept it in
*Lord of the Rings actor gets hurt*  Peter Jackson: "Let's keep it!"
Anyone else notice Scarletts breasts are photoshopped bigger in the thumbnail?
I'll probably never research whether these are true stories or not but still entertaining
I don't think you should have an AI generated voice say Arnold Shwarzenegger if you're going to post the video on the internet.....just saying
The commentary would be so much better if it wasn't read out so lifelessly
I don’t get how people manage to stay in character. You get an epic tickling from life itself and you don’t laugh? 😳
In the Navy is a "corpsman" but is understandable people will get it confused with "medic". The best acting is when there is no acting.
On the subject of lord of the rings the scene with Aragorn slashing at the thrown dagger was a fluke since the Uruk-hai actor accidentally threw the dagger when it slipped out of his hand
I think 40-yr Old Virgin waxing scene should be here.
Bro thought he could get away with Arnold swartzeni****
watch the leather mannnnn
I heard Rupert Grint improvised his butt off during those acting drunk scenes.
1:53 🤨
Amazing jaja ❤
As they say. the truth is better than fiction.
I stopped the video at "Star Wars". That show is not intellectual.
I don't believe half of these
Poor Ron 😂
Are every single one of these made up?
Victorian woman... The hero we need.
I love these, but the most memorable scene of Wolf of Wall Street is 2 scenes and they both involve Margot Robbie...
Making her Boobs bigger for the Thumbnail was a blooper too?
Wow…the lies keep coming. Congrats to the person(s) who make money by being dishonest. Great contribution to society…
Farts are funny
What about the smashed guitar in Hateful Eight?
Wow. Mcconaughey's face/head looks really narrow. He still hasn't gained all his weight back after filming Dallas Buyer's Club.
I wonder what percentage of those are bullshit.   We know that Gandalf's actor and the director "remember it differently"...
Is it just me or in 1:50 into the vid he just said the n word 💀👎🏽
A lot of these are impressive in terms of being funny and clever on-the-spot thinking, but Tom Hanks improvising the scene with the military nurse as Captain Phillips is the finest *acting* on display.
I can promise you that that was not the most memorable part of the Wolf of Wall Street. I'm going to say Margot Robbie standing in the doorway may have been the most memorable part😅😅
Ok, with the kids telling Arnold about their dads. The twins’ line is *definitely* scripted…they wouldn’t just say that reply in unison unprompted, lmfao
Who is "Hairy Potter"???
Improv scenes are not the same as bloopers.
Doubt
These are great!
does that mean, that Will Smith would've actually been at a barbacue that day?
You've bumpt up Scarlet's boobs in the preview! Ok, but it works 🤣
As always, US moves= Segregation central!
DRINK EVERY FKN TIME HE SAYS "FOUND IT HILARIOUS"
Why the replay? If I want to see it again, I know how to move the progress bar!
Punchung out, the camera just happened to be at that low angle to capture it. What a load of bollocks.
I can imagine a future, where a movie is roughly scripted, and actors improve the entire thing.
PEOPLE ARE SO GULLIBLE
feels nice to have revanced youtube it automatically skips every transition
Bill Murray hitting the deck sent me. It's the fact that he might think he's saved it and it all goes wrong.
Clicked because of the thumbnail "Under the Skin" which fascinated me in a weird way. Turns out the blooper about it is the most interesting  from the list
Why would they put any actress through the dangers of a hidden camera and meeting potential...I dunno...killers?....no?...Ok, maybe its just me fearing things.
Really love a knights tale
Some might consider another scene from Wolf of Wall Street more memorable
Happy Mistakes.
"I can't wait till computer take over all the terrible jobs so that humans can spend their time doing creative things" 'Oh, turns out the creative things are actually way easier for the computers to do.  Looks like you'll have to keep the terrible jobs going'
"What the hell is that smell!!" is so perfectly and iconic, it's _Wild_ that it was an ad lib
straight to the point. No intro. I love it.
This is why we have Youtube. Great stuff to learn about all these movies!
Let's make things up for likes.
Um, the clocking in machine?
I question which ones were really bloopers, and which ones were improvd by the actor and then the director says we'll keep that in when we shoot. Cutting away to a different camera angle is a giveaway, unless they're shooting a scene with more than one camera.
If ScarJoe had to lure me into a van then I see no reason to say no.
Aeyo Mike Hannigan in the first clip
The most unrealistic scene in Captain Philips was having a Chief do any sort of patient contact.
That code 4 was wild that it was real and unscripted!
The Navy dosen't have "medics", that's the Army.  The Navy has "corpsmen" (or as Pres Obama calls them "corpsemen").
Good for that lady who made the movie pay for her car impoundment
Half of these were 100% scripted but fun video.
I detest fart so called humour. Its had its day..let's all politeness up a bit..I ban some words use to help ..
Who else came for Hendrick’s chest muffins
Hopefully, Will Smith never works a day the rest of his life.
Tom Hanks is such a clown
Most of these "bloopers" are fake. They are lies that became lore.
It's crucial to highlight for everyone here that what may seem like bloopers or improv in movies are often misrepresented. Merely selecting a moment from a film and labeling it as improvisation is misinformation, but it's cheap and easy entertainment for an audience who now feel like they've infiltrated the 4th wall somehow and have shared a moment with the actors. There's a flood of this content saturating platforms like YouTube lately, they're akin to the prevalence of 'actors enduring injuries during stunts and continuing to perform' videos. The vast majority of these instances are fabricated, including this video. I challenge someone to find me a single reference for any of these claims: an interview, an article, anything which backs up anything this video says.
"silence of the LAmbs" the Hanibal lector sceene is clearly missing.... Movie History
Rain man is the greatest tom Cruise movie
Yeah.... most or all of these claims are false.  Why is this a trend?  Taking scenes from movies and claiming it was unscripted.  It's rampant.
The Joker one is either a fake OR after he did that they thought it was great and decided to reshoot it otherwise why have it framed up for two cameras if it was spontaneous.
Definitely not the most memorable scene in wolf of Wall Street but definitely a good one 😏
The  Joker  one  was not a  blooper.
I hope people are smart enough to at least google this guys claims. Most of them are made up.
When people say actors have the easiest jobs in the world, it’s moments like this that showcase not everyone is made for it.
A lot of these are lies. Actors lie about these stories all the time!
Never thought I'd see Scarlet Johanson on a Dublin bus!!
The whole improvised Captain Philips scene is incredible!! It's so real that you feel more like watching a documentary or a live broadcast.
You missed the best The usual suspects blooper. The lineup scene! All of that was unscripted and they were actually laughing. Totally awesome!
Uh oh fart! Uh oh fart. Fart!
The Evil Dead one isnt improv
“I’m walking here’s “
1:50 Disgusting German weed! sold his soul for fame. But when your body dies, the 5 B.M.W. remain in your garage. But I can understand him, what else should you do if you have the consciousness of a slamander!
Scarlett wouldn't need to do much luring!
BS all lies.........................
More list videos need to be this concise. Cheers mate.
Uh some of these aren't bloopers. An improvisation or an adlib isn't a blooper.
i dont all of them are "real" they might say so
I love how many bloopers can be instant improvised moments, yet caught from several different angles requiring several different lighting set-ups.  Gettysburg is the best, it starts on a wide then cuts to a medium angle which would have required the camera to be in view in the wide shot hahaha
Leo would kick a horse in the face. That's just one of his many fortes
that is not the most memorable scene from wolf of wall street
I did the monologue from a Knight tale for an audition. But my acting coach told me to shave my beard and come casting time. They said we were looking for somebody with a big beard. Luckily, my casting coach had a big beard and he got the role, so never again will I ever use acting coach
The best 'go with it' was the scene in bed, where she doesn't just make a comment, but actually turns on the afterburners and screams "this is why we don't have sex". That was brilliant.
2:06 um...would your dad happen to be "mr sins" 🤔😄
I'm here for the thumbnail.
ai voice lmao
How do you know, what was intended or not, scripted or not?
I'm  pretty sure the most remembered scene from Wolf of Wall Street involves Margot Robbie and nudity...
Will Smith is gay
By the way everyone came for the lady
wait... so non of these men new how was Scarlett Johansson?! lol I can't believe it
heyy watch the leather man uhehehehe
Robin  Williams > fcuk the shrimp  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂/........what a natural talent he was and always remembered,,,,,,,,
The star trek thing is not real.  She was an actor but she was not meant to talk.  She did and they liked it and kept it, but it did stop production for nearly a day so they could do the paperwork.  There was never any broken down car or impounding.
Not sure about the punch out, there were two cameras set up for that.
1:53 | Arnold WHAT?
thought you were not going to use an ai voice, ruined the whole thing.
that thumbnail looks sus 😂
The knights tale one is so perfect
Flicked a lit cigarette right into that guys eye lol
1:53. Arnold Schwart... what???
1:06 - What the hell is that SMELL?! That would be your wife, Will.  Your wife.
Imagine being some guy, walking home from work, it's wet and dark and cold.  Then, a car pulls up, and it's fucking Scarlet Johansen in a wig, in some shitty town car and she starts trying to rizz you up.
the foreshadowing of will to smell all those years ago the rancid stank from JI Jane that would utterly and ultimately drive him insane
he did not say schwarzenegger
The Chewbacca one is by far my favorite Harrison’s response is gold
Big Ups
sometimes the most iconic scenes are not scrypted  I remeber the whole monologue of Scrybe in Asterix And Obelix: Mission Cleopatra was improvisation, they told actor to say something that doesn't make any sense
In an interview while back Ian stated that the scene where he bumped his head was actually scripted.
Since when did Scarlet had that big of a bust?
"Blind people cant read..." except...f-for brail...O>o BAM!
Thanks Alex for the voiceover my ass, this is AI
1:53 Arnold Schwarzeni- WHAT!?
Do this in 2024
I don’t believe a lot of these are true tbh. 🙈
Ok the kindergarten cop 😂😂
fake info)
Bruh. i'd have gotten in the prop van with scarlet. No shot.
I always forget that these are those videos with commentary. The moment I realize, though, I log off.
Leonardo Dicaprio is always the most amazing to me. He improvised when he got attacked by a real bear in Revenant, and the director kept the scene. True method acting
So, the “elephant man” in under the skin wasn’t an actor?
As someone who grew up in los angeles and had many friends who were actors or in the industry in other ways, i believe at least 1% of these stories. Actors like to tell stories that make themselves seem interesting. They also love to take credit for things. Its litterally their job to lie convincingly.
😭💔
Improvising isn't really a blooper, is it?
Good job there was a second random camera of the clock machine.
🧢
what you smokin man
Shades of that unscripted "Star Trek" walk on extra: An acquaintance of mine was once in the mid 80s was walking downtown LA late one night.  He comes upon a movie set on a blocked off street & filming.    He decided to "mill around" & see what's up.  A casting director grabs him & says: "You'll make a perfect Chef for the next scene - here put this Chef hat & white apron on !"  Even though just a bystander, he does exactly that & is told he's to stand behind the counter & flip a Pizza dough round into the air, while the action films star, Charles Bronson, drives rams a car into the plate glass storefront window & exits the car & chases the suspect.  He's shocked to be thrown into a scene with famous actor Charles Bronson & doesn't let on who he ISN'T, LOL   He calculatedly waits until the entire scene is shot & director yells "Cut" (no redoing such an expensive scene) before telling the casting director "I'm not an actor at all, I was just standing here when you corralled me into this role".  Horrified at her error she had him sign a "Screen Actors Guild" Temporary Card & liability waiver - he had no speaking but did appear clearly on screen - I wanna say they gave him $200 ish dollars - plus screen time & a credit.  This is 100% true & some years later my wife & I rented the movie - sure enough it was him - not that I doubted it.  I ***"Think"*** it was Murphy's Law" w/ Charles Bronson, circa 1986.
Is that scarlet Johansson, as velma?
I believe that 1 out of 5 stories are true
15:53 Arnold What Now?
no proof of any of this
So the guys weren't actors and only told it was a movie afterwards. After they stripped naked and walked into a pool of black tar?
Do people really believe the "punching out" thing wasn't scripted? It's totally normal for a heavy electrical device not to be mounted with any kind of anchor, right? The wall is fucking clean where the thing was hanging, no holes, no brackets, no nothing. I'm pretty much guessing magnets behind the drywall.
I love when they improvise and director put the right camera angles before improvisation to film improvisation that he doesnt know yet! Masters at work!
Many of these aren't bloopers at all. Just improvisational acting.
dark knight heath ledger
“Just tea, thank you”
Why would you photoshop Scarlett Johanson’s chest in the thumbnail? 🤦🏼‍♀️ grow up
Yh i hear arnold Schwarzenegger 😂
4:30 that's probably the best blooper ever
I'd forgive Paul Rudd 😉🤭
You tube sux
whos that girl on 5:34, looks beautiful
@6:50 the only man to steal from Nakatomi
No fucking way imagine getting picked up in a van outside Morrisons by Scarlett Jo
Peter Greene is such a damn handsome devil. He's such a perfect 'charismatic villain' type of actor~
4:01 your welcome
Good narration, cheers.
Great intro hahaha
I’m so tired of the Joker.  Now we have Trump.  He’s so boring boring boring boring.  The psycho button never stops.
Saw Captain Phillips only once, but knew right away she's a real medic. No movie or tv medical staff has ever been _that_ convincing. And Tom Hank's breakdown in that scene is among the best ever captured on film.
The mob seen with RL LEE actually happened. Read about it. He was a hero to his men and is to us in the south. He stayed true to his state, of VIRGINIA. Had his state been for the north, he would have fought for the north. Loyalty should not be a fault. He deserves more accolades than he is honored with. MUCH MORE.
ok for the life of me in Mad Max towards the end- when Johnny the boy drops the crowbar before breaking open a service phone i wonder if that was in the script or not?
The most memorable scenes in Wolf of Wall Street all involve Margot Robbie.
That was a lot of fun 🎉
Buster Keaton FTW
Did you really have to enhance Scarlet's breasts for the thumbnail? Jesus. 🙄
lol wait wait wait a minute that guy in the joker is joaquin phoenix? i havent watch the movie or bother to look it up but i seen the memes and clips/gif from the movie and i couldnt tell that was him lol
In the Lion King cartoon, Scar accidentally threw Mufasa over a cliff, they decided to leave this scene in the film.
I can’t believe how much I enjoyed this! Well done🎉
I believe jus some of these
I'm not sure I like how you pronounce Schwarzenegger. It's terribly close to uhmm.... you know.
yeah, i belive in it... i belive that improves so sudden well recorded, with right placed camera and angle...
1:52 holy shit 💀💀say his last name again, just slower this time
Phoenix really became the Joker for the movie 👀👀
Well, to be fair, the blind wizard from the Lego movie could've written it in Braille, so yes, he could've read it later on 🤔
That cigarette scene made me laugh so bad for some reason. The timing of everything landed perfectly. That's a masterpiece right there.
my favorite one is infinity war "I do you one better. WHY IS GAMORA"
Dang, the last one was OP
When Chewbacca handed over the jacket though 😂😂😂😂
Accidental or not… you flick a lit cigarette in my face I’m not going for the next Take, I’m going for his face and a court case 😂
Finally some improvised scenes that don’t appear on everyone else’s channels.
explains why there was 3 cameras on the clock for the joker
No way that scene from A Knight's Tale is improvised, it's one of the most iconic scenes in the movie! Wow, the more you know!
Not sure i believe half of these
improvisation =/= bloopers lol
Imagine they have a dedicated camera for the improvised actions.🙃 Some are just made up
Nice click bait
I struggle to believe that you wouldn't think a movie was being shot when scarlett johansson pulls up in a van and asks if you want to have sex
The chewy one got me. That was good
imagine the punching out didnt work ... ouch
That thumbnail is annoying. Her shirt / chest is clearly smudged and or liquified.
The Birdcage is one of my all time favorite movies. “Fuck The Shrimp!”
This whole vid is probably made up
'Under the skin' wow!
Do you make up these statements yourself?
Arnold who ? 😂
I need to rewatch The Wolf of Wall Street cuz I remember that movie was amazing
What's with these channels and making up these "Bloopers too good to cut" compilations that are just false. The very first clip... yeah he was supposed to punch it off the wall. That is why the machine is not ACTUALLY attached to the wall. look at that pristine wall that was clearly holding the time machine up with tape.   Love the internet and the false lore they try to create.
Today I learned Matthew McConaughey is probably always high when filming.
Would be great if you don’t fucking talk over most of the clips 🤡
The Joker scene is NOT a blooper. That's the actor improvising.
I might be wrong, but some of these aren't bloopers that "were too good to cut". Birdcage, Rainman, Scrooged were absolutely unplanned, but stayed in the movie, because aren't ruining the scene. Those scenes are described in the title. While there are scenes that looked problematic to be called 'blooper'. Hear me out: 1) Joker Why was there a second camera for the low-angle shot if it wasn't planned? 2) Independence Day Three (3!) different angle for something that isn't in the script and the director just "let it in"? 3) Kindergarten Cop There might be children telling there real fathers' job, but those two (twin girls and the boy) shown in the video definitely not.
just realized, that the kid @2:11 is gage from pet sematary... :o :o :o
Robin Williams falls a lot
"It's the springs" lol genius
so the twin girls saying that their mom says their dad is a sex machine improvised? and the protagonist child who says his dad looks at vaginas all day improvised?? somehow i doubt it
watch the leather man!
did you enlarge her friggin Yorkshire Puddings on the thumbnail xD
My daddy is a gynecologist and he looks at vaginas all day long. 😂😂🤣🤣
This is why you're not allowed to stop acting unless the director said cut.
Well done, you!
Wait, if Joaquin punching the clock off the wall wasn't part of the script, how come the second camera was so strategically placed to capture the closeup shot as the clock falls off at 0:34?
I wish Scarlet Johansson would come hit me up in a van 🤤
I fart more than this guy, I have to leave windows open literally
We all know the most memorable scene at Wolf of Wall Street  😏
gotta say i enjoy these videos editing, quick and to the point 10/10!
is everything you said 100% real? Someone fact check the video
I can't believe the smell from Independence Day was NOT the alien.
To lure people with a thumbnail of Scarlett Johansson with bigger boobs is Pathetic.
Paul Reubens was hilarious 😆 😊
You did not just photoshop Scarlet Johanssons boobs for the thumbnail!? Shame...
“Ended up beating on one’s chest” 😂
That Buster Keaton scene looks dangerous!!!
6:06 Robin Williams HIMSELF is struggling to not laugh at himself 😂
"In Dazed and Confused, Matthew Mcconaughey was high for real." Yeah, we all know! 😂 The real question is when was Matthew McConaughey NOT high? 😂
Is that what we are calling tits now? Bloopers?
Arnold what???????
Under the skin: They were filmed without knowledge or consent and put into a movie?! Illegal much?
https://youtu.be/e-bK9nxI7Ic?si=6476AyJd6m1QciSr
why tf did u photoshop scarlet johansons boobs bigger in the thumbnail
I cannot believe you photoshopped scarlet’s boobs for thumbnail
Paul Rubens, consummate actor! “ excuse me”
Good vid but some of these are improvs, not bloopers Paul rudd farting = improv Ron weasley falling off couch = blooper
1:52 Arnold Schwarzen-   What-?
As a lifelong man, I can assure you, that isn't the most memorable scene from The Wolf of Wall Street.
I see what you did with the thumbnail hahahaha
Why was there a camera pointed up at the time clock when Joaquin improvised the "punching out" scene? Hmmm
Modern Family - Claire falling on the eggs
Don't see the appeal or attention given to Matthew McConaughey chest beating!
Good stuff 😂
Well, Under the Skin really validated my view.  If it's too good to be true, it's most likely worse.
Bull Murray's fall was epic! 🤣🤣🤣
how th fuq does this guy know?
AHAHAH my dad "looks at v@ginas all day long" that's great. a million percent better knowing it was his real answer
I have my doubts about some of these, weird how the camera seems perfectly placed to capture supposedly "improvised" moments
Under the Skin.  The You Is In The Wrong hood was real, that should have been in this. SJ kept it together and got out of there. Under The Skin is a slow burn, not much of Hollywood wiz-pop, think about it, one of the world's most famous actresses, in a wig and a Transit Van, she was never once recognized, and there were 2 crew and 2 security in the back of the van and police 30 seconds away. Elephant man was a local professor they met in a pub one night. Very few movies ever had that much improv.
Farting must be a very good blooper to cut. Quality content for us, viewers...
2:02 yo, wtf with their parents? Why their mom said that in front of their children lol xD
“Fuck the shrimp” 😂
❤I would like to thank all movie makers for creating a rich world of fantasy and inspiration.
Stfu and let us watch the movie. Don't need your commentary..
Sss
How could you get real guys to talk to scarlet johanson and them not go holy shit it’s scarlet johanson?
The evil dead one with the mud and his face showing…that’s not a blooper

I'm happy the horse stayed in character
Ian McKellen actually hit his head on purpose, he just didn't tell Peter Jackson about it... or that is if you believe Ian, and he isn't just saying that because it was embarrassing 😂
just stealing other faggy youtubers content and making it your own. get a real job
"00:41 Ahh, Dorian Tyrell vas tha mask. II sua itt vitth m'oovn ajs."
Best part about having bloopers or adlibs with any iteration of Joker is that he can laugh, and you don't have to stifle it or redo the take for corpsing... I rememeber they used similar idea in Friends where Lisa Kudrow started laughing and when someone lamented over a ruined take, she said "it's okay, Phoebe can laugh".
Not that anyone cares, but the Gettysburg one is innacurate... the reenactors volunteered from all across the country to appear in massive battle scenes. It's not like they were random reenactors that showed up to the set, and you can clearly tell their costumes fit the color palette for the film and that they are done up to fit the style of the production
The kids talking about their parents is obviously scripted. The twins very clearly rehearsed their lines at the very least.
4:05 So, Braille is not a thing according to you?
A funny ritual or just a plain ritual 🤔, those hollyweird people
Why does the Star Trek 4 lady look Vulcan?  Ears too. Am I just seeing this
How could you miss the best one of all American Graffiti with the moped crash.
You photoshopped scarlet's boobs to be bigger in the thumbnail. Shame on you.
I'm missing Pretty Woman and closing the box with the necklace, tripping Julia's hand in it.
So if they hire somebody from Burger King to make a Burger King cameo about somebody that works at Burger King is that still considered improvised if he does exactly what he does in his regular job?
How is the Captain Philipp's scene a blooper?
Most of these were actually scripted.
What a cool compilation. Thanks!
Why is your source material like 360p ?
Oh my goodness, the Scarlett Johansson not-really-bloopers.  Just imagine those guys thingking that *_wow,_*_ this is actually happening, this gorgeous women is chatting me up to get me in her car and I'm totally going to ..._  ...  ...  ... _be a 15 second extra in a movie._  💀💀💀 😭
FYI there is no such thing as a Navy “medic”
5:27 friggin npc!
4:47 I wonder if a series of funny accidents could've helped part 3🤔🤯🫠
"Bloopers" which last on multiple shots, with different camera angles... ? 🤔
Will could have been at p diddys working on the back door if you follow my drift
Half of these are not bloopers.
That Mystery Men improv is iconic.
7:29 did the thumbnail work out for you? 🎨
"The navy medic".  How many people below are screaming "CORPSMAN!!!!!!!" right now in the comment section? I am not even gonna scroll down. Also, apparently she got teased and even bullied due to her appearance in the movie, which is a really shitty thing to do by others to what is basically their own sibling.
I honestly don't believe a lot of these
The improvisational genius of these actors is off the chart - mostly farting and falling over.
I wonder how much of this bloopers were real.
1:51 arnold schwarze- what?
EXCELLENT....5 Stars..truly LOL
of course they make you wait until the end to find out who the chick in the tight pink sweater is
kindergartencop the children.... i cant breathe XD
That Die Hard scene is a classic, I wonder if the SWAT members pricking himself on the bushes and going oooow also is a happy accident.
Our dad is a sex machine  unscripted? I have questions
Great selection. Love it.
How could the crew not be amused by him farting around in bed?
You're telling me Scarlett Johansson just want out seducing random men and they filmed it?? 😂😂
What about Kevin Nash that got stabbed with a real knife in the Punisher but finished the scene.
7:22
You can actually see his ass move.
Just to be clear: only SOME of the men scarlet approaches were not actors.  Some of them were actors. Get your facts right!!!!  It is well documented on the dvd extras!!!
The Lord of The Rings scene where Gandalf hit his head was scripted.
Force Awakens was 9 years ago ? WTF
I farted three times in a row in sympathy at the first clip.
THE CIGARETTE "FUCK!" 😆I'm dying!
A lot of this is bullshit
So random, just by seeing him, man oh man do I wish Heath Ledger was still alive.
Im still baffled about the choice of having the Joker be an elderly woman.
Paul Rudd is such a dude 😂😂
I DO NOT appreciate the editing to Scarlett's chest in the thumbnail. I am restricting this channel. I love that movie.
For Under The Skin, I just saw that movie recently so I wonder how long it took for the crew to tell them it was a movie? Some scenes, maybe two, could get away with the hidden camera but a bunch of those guys d!ed in the movie and appeared naked. It'd be nice if this video was more specific about which scenes were candid
Ace Ventura Chitty Chitty Bang Bang scene was left in.
More than half of these were clearly scripted but ok
most of them are not "improvised" and instead urban legends or studio psyops to get viral marketing going
Me watching this video wasn't scripted at all but it was so good that I decided to watch it to the end.
If the joker punching the clock scene is unplanned, how do they know that he is going to do that act and set the camera angle from below?
I live by the Great Salt Lake and it stinks really bad sometimes 😂😂😂
Amazing how many of these improvised lines were caught by the second or third camera...
Even the Star Wars bloopers are sad.
lol
Captain Phillips is a great film. And that ending really sealed it for me.
Poor horse
That joke about punching was hilarious 😂
Why is this a stupid commentary and not just the clips themselves?
Some of these are pretty wild lol. It's kind of cool and respectable when they are kept in!
Couldn’t even use real voice over? F this AI bs
You missed/skipped one of the most famous scenes in cinema ... from the movie "Midnight Cowboy".  The 1969 movie won three Oscars (Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay) and had a scene where Joe Buck & Ratso Rizzo (Jon Voight & Dustin Hoffman) are crossing in a sidewalk and almost get hit by a taxi.  This was a mistake as the taxi had run into the scene but Hoffman stayed in character and added the now classic line: “I'm walkin' here!” as he hits the front of the taxi.
You know blooper is different than improvised
1:53 🧔🏿‍♂️
6:27 recently when? That movie is from 1999, Howard Stern was most popular in the 2000s, and already old then!
And that wasn’t sign that maybe you are glorifying the wrong dude when 100’s of CONFEDERATE wannabes were CHEERING Robert E Lee?
Yeah, Scarlet Jo accosts me on teh street and tries to pick me up. Totally normal. I'd play along. NOT
6:22 me tonight! 420 baby🫶🏾👯🏾‍♀️✨️
She said, "Don't fart in the bed." Wow that is very hilarious.
Tom Felton improvised the line "I didn't know you could read" after forgetting his real line in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.
I watched that cigarette go right into Baldwin's eye one frame at a time. That must have been painful.
I haven't a single one of these films. That wild. The Lord of The Rings was my favourite, though 😂
Now knowing that that cigarette flip into his eye was real made me winced. Ouch...
"Ian Mckellen played it off so well..." Man, he didn't play off anything, that's just what happens when you smack your head on something that hard, he didn't know where he was in that moment.
01:06 They also didn’t cut his Oscar blooper.
Imagine having to explain to wife/girlfriend that you got in a van with Scarlett Johansson but didn't know it was for a movie.
4:20 Oh wow!  Bill Murray really almost broke his right ankle there.
#1 - that isn't a 'blooper' that is an ad lib from a great actor. Know the difference. So far nearly all the examples are not bloopers, they are ad libs. Took you to the Revenant to actually get to a blooper.
Went and watched the scene with Tom Hanks and it’s perfection. She is so real and slips into her training but there is genuine care and reaction to him in her voice. He gave them such realistically acted trauma that they went on autopilot with their training. Brilliantly done.
snore
So many of the unscripted moments seem highly scripted.  Who falls for this stuff 🤦🏾‍♂️
HF dropped the ball,  with his acting experience he should’ve gone with it and said something like “Cheers buddy”
The cheesy, overused stock background music detracts from this otherwise watchable content
ok the Scarlett Johansson one is absolute BS. The scenes were all filmed with movie cameras, a full production team, sets, not with a hidden camera on a bus etc.
End of watch one was cool to know.
1:57, interesting
the twin girls speaking at the same time in kindergarten cop obviously can't be improvised
Bless blopper video ive ever seen.
What I learned from this video: Matthew McConaughey has the best bloopers.
Quite the strech...
those are not bloopers
Ain't no way I thought that was Susu in the thumbnail 💀
Dustin Hoffman ad libbing "i'm walking here!" in The Midnight Cowboy, when a real taxi almost hit him, should definitely have been on this list
1:54 Arnold Schwarz-a-what? I didn’t think you spell it with an “I”.
Ethiopia was not ment to be poor😢
did you seriously just inflate them in the thumbnail?
this video is an IQ test
Paul Rudd does NOT FART! 😇
The guys that got into Scarlet Johansen's car...I wonder what their wives thought about that???
The clocking in machine? 😂
who wouldn't get into the car with younger scarlet
Another good blooper was in The Hateful Eight, where Kirk Russell grabs a vintage 1870 guitar from Jennifer Jason Leigh, and smashes it to smithereens. She was genuinely horrified.
7:13 he could have died. why...
Good stuff
You make an entire video about bloopers that stayed in for Pretty Woman.
Plot twist the alien is real in independence day
WOW! Jeremy Allen Wight looks just like what Paul Reuben looked like.
No pretty woman and the jewelry box!?
Hey Malkovich, think fast!
Right off the bat, the scene from joker isn't a blooper...called improv
In the US, Biden was never meant to be the president but the election comission thought it would be a good laugh so they let him stay.  The rest is history!
So many of these are not bloopers
You know I would've watched the video for the trivia, you didn't have to Photoshop ScarJo's Bob's bigger in the thumbnail... But to each their own I guess
Paul Reubens was a master, that line was lightning fast and perfectly delivered.
Our mom says our dad is a real sex machine 😂
Thumbnail is blatantly photoshopped to embiggen Scarjo's jugs. For shame...
Many of these are not bloopers but things created by the actors during rehersals. How can the Joker's clock scene be a blooper if the second shot is perfectly framed to for the action of him punching the clock?! Same thing with Will Smith complaining about the smelll - all those extra shots of him kicking the alien are planned. Bloopers are scenes that happen by accident, not a thing that the actor deliberatly decided to do.
The medic scene in Captain Phillips is sooo good
And all that’s without mentioning the scene in Dark Knight when Joker blows up the hospital, but the explosions stopped midway through and Heath Ledger stayed in character wondering why the explosions stopped.
0:50 Imagine starting a gang war because of an accidental misflick😂
No, their reactions to the fart were not genuine. They remained in character, which is improvisation.
It's probably funny to everyone, but Matthew
Robin Williams was a priceless gem💙
7:25 I wouldn't want to be the man telling people that "I thought I was going to have s*x with Scarlett Johanson, got in her car, only to find out it was a scene for a movie."
Buster is the Goat
The bit about Under The Skin with them actually filming unwitting guys genuinely being coerced into the van is fucking wild. I don't know how the movie is never having seen it, but if it's any good it should be bigger for that fact. Imagine if the roles were reversed in this movie and it was a guy trying to convince everyday women to get in his van lol. Also that bit with Joaquin Pheonix is a great improv scene, something about Joker brings it out it seems :^)
The cigarette in the eye its just fuckin hilarious, lmao
ok this is actually really good, i laughed at pretty much every scene in the first 2 minutes lmao great job
The Capt Phillips scene hits me. Not only was this scene improvised but the very idea to have the scene was improvised on the spot. Real-life medic, Danielle Albert was only there by chance and the director asked her to do this scene after seeing her that day. But when Sony executives called Greengrass after laying eyes on the raw footage from the scene, they weren't asking about Hanks. They wanted to know: "Who's the girl?" Haha, the medic has star quality honesty.
I don't believe half of these
4:59  Kind of looks like he turns his hand over and drops it....🤷‍♂
I didn't know the dudes from smash mouths hit song all star were actually movie characters
arnold shcwartza-who?
7:50 Are you sure? Are you sure that's the _most_ memorable scene? Because I think it'd be the one with Margot Robbie.
Luca Brasi showing respect to Vito at the wedding. Was supposed to be much smoother but actor was so nervous he had a bit of trouble and it worked out swimmingly.
The Joker bit was not in the script but somehow it had multiple camera angles. Okay buddy.
besides not having any proof that these famously improvised scenes were actually improvised, nobody explains why certain scenes were filming in the right angle at the right time. I hardly believe in improvised scenes as the punch out or the cigarette scene or the Independence Day scene
I'd rather chew tin foil than hear and see that stupid chest beating scene in WOWS.
5:53 INCORRECT! First, Andrews did not trip. She turned her ankle. Yes, the director liked it as a symbol of her faltering confidence while trying to tell herself she was confident, but he didn't "keep it in". He asked her to do that intentionally in following takes. The one used in the movie was not the real one but a reenactment. Since the video gets this well-known fact incorrect, it makes me doubt that anything else he says is accurate. I won't be watching the rest of the video since it's probably more lies.
Yeah no - these are all bullshit.
3:23 поставь на паузу и увидишь упоротую лошадь
arnold shwaz what
Most of these arent bloopers or improvisation
1000th Comment! Unless someone deletes their comment! 😅
Ol Harrison was really confused. Extra confused.
Mathew Mckonahee is the king of improv!!
The two little girls in kindergarten cop looks like a young Raegan Revord
When Gandalf hit his head in that hobbit house I friggin lost it laughing🤣
"The now famous line." The Line: "Excuse me."
CHEWY lmaooooo
straight to the point and simply explained. much much better than watchmojo
What guy wouldn't get into a creepy van with Scarlett?😅😅
This is why I could never be an actor, if I went off-script I would immediately be like “oh crap I messed up” but nah all these guys do that and manage to incorporate it into the scene on the spot
So apparently Will Smith has a history
That Paul Reubens improv line in Mystery Men is gold!
If we're talking LOTR, the scere from Fellowship of the Ring, where Aragorn is fighting Lurtz and Aragorn deflects the flying dagger was unscripted. Lawrence Makoare (who played Lurtz) was suppose to throw the dagger and miss Vigo Mortensen, but misjudged the throw. It normally wouldn't be a problem, but that dagger was very real and thus very dangerous. Also there're Vigo's two broken toes during the helmet kick in Two Towers, but everyone knows that one.
Bloopers and improvising are not the same thing.
Buster Keaton is still the goat .
05:20  This was a stroke of luck ! ... 😊👍  05:42  She made it look so real ! ... 😊 But, it WAS real ! ... 😊👍   05:54  Robin W. the LEGEND ! ... 😊👍
2:36 Oh sh!t, It's King Robert
Kindergarten cop -Very disturbing fir kids to talk about their real experiences between the parents  -Very disturbing for the show to give them scripts like that -Very disturbing to even leave those scripts in the movie
It's a bit weird and creepy how you made Scarlett's boobs bigger in the thumbnail.
2:07
Mystery Men is the first DVD I ever watched when DVD became a thing... ... 😆
I haven’t watched any of the Harry Potter movies since the first one when I was a kid in the early 2000s. All I can say is ..Ron got fine 😮
i just wanna ask you one Q, how did you collect those information? i always wondered!
In the iconic cage scene from JAWS, a real shark got tangled up in the rope of a miniature cage and thrashed around violently to get itself free. The shot and scenery of it was so good that they wrote it into the movie. Since nothing was in the cage when it was supposed to be the demise of Hooper, they also rewrote him to survive in the film. Thanks to this, the film's crew had just avoided the killing of one of the most likable supporting characters in all of classic horror cinema.
The Morgan Freeman one sent me 💀💀💀💀
Brad Pitt from Ocean 11, the burger he ate was really spicy for final scene ,Tea Leoni slipped and fell on cashier machine in Fun With Dick and Jane and Dwayne Johnson accidentally throw real punch to Michael Clarke Duncan and the extra who watched the fight were stunned
0:04  Best advice from a movie, leave the room if you have to.  💨
When bill murray slipped and fell on the water, he should've got up and said "You better clean that up before somebody breaks a neck."
This was too good 😄
Is that a bridge 1:51
No it wasn’t…
I’m not sure I’m buying that all these were unscripted
who cares disneysw???
will smith funny 😂
I don't believe some of these tbh
"Bloopers"? That is why some people still go to LIVE theatre, you become part of it, and if an actor makes a little mistake, there is no "cut..take 23" no sir...they laugh along with you.
So, Matthew McConaughey is a real... 🌽🏐
Al Leong with the candy bar will always be iconic
swartzenAGger
Scarlet Johansson can lure me into a van anytime.
Fuck how hot is  	Scarlett Johansson , imean she inst prretty  not really that good looking ... She just oozes sexuality to me ......omfg now excuse me i just got some new Aloe moisturiser
Cant believe Dustin Hoffman actually dutchovened Tom Cruise for real..Lol!😂
0:05😆😆🤣🤣
Wow cool
Nobody gonna talk about how "Three ages" literally had improv so great that he almost died falling multiple stories down, only to be saved by a pipe and some cloth
I do not believe this is 100% accurate
The bloopers is a paid actor
It wasn’t my most memorable scene in Wolf of Wall Street….😮
That’s what makes a great actor and then rolling with it
The Tom Hanks scene is 10/10. Just a reminder to really appreciate good actors.
I agree with you too
so no Mark Whalberg in fear peep hole at the door
As the time machine was only fixed with tape i guess it was planned
Regarding Kindergarten Cop, neither of child actor Miko Hughes' parents was a gynecologist. His mom stayed at home and his dad was a vfx tech in the industry. He must certainly was given a line
Even funnier I've heard that Leonardo DiCaprio when he looked around in awkwardness during that scene It was actually him looking at Martin Scorsese off camera for approval and then he'd go along with it
The bit with Han, Chewie and the coat also works as a callback to a few min. earlier in the movie when Chewie complains about the cold and Han replies sarcastically.  You can imagine Chewie saying to Han, "Here. Wouldn't want you to get cold."
How can the lord of the ring scene a blooper? I mean there was a second camera in the perfect angle which wouldn’t make any sense when not for this shot
I don't know how you didn't put in The Lineup Scene from the movie The Usual Suspects. It's probably The Best Blooper left in a movie
Joaquin punching out was the best. I can't imagine it without it.
Did you know Viggo broke his toe during the filming of the two towers?
Interesting. Thanks.
The deer hunter: the scene where Christopher walken spit in Robert deniros face Was also not Scripted. Roberts reaction was totally real and he was pissed of after the shot
Thankfully the camera was coincidentally pointed at the punching machine at that time.
Fun fact: I didn't even watch a single movie listed in this video.
5:21 genius
Mystery men is a classic
Source: reddit/other popular site or "just trust me bro". Half of those are not bloopers or improvs. Also great job always putting big booba on thumbnail.
The End of Watch one was actually insane, shows you how much research the actors do to prepare for a role. And Jooaquin Pheonix is one of the best actors of our generation
I turn 31 on May 29th and until this moment it did not click that Maria from Sound of Music and Mary Poppins were the same person…their costumes and personality are so different!!!!
Theres no way those children said all that without  being told
All of these were great, except the newer star wars film. The new ones are garbage. Please keep those away from a lot of the classic movies.
Al Leong’s name is pronounced Long. As in Dragon.  The E is just from the Cantonese non standard romanization for phonetic Chinese. You don’t actually pronounce it.
Matthew McConaughey is a legend.
Please do the movie Alien from the 70s 😀😀😀
Absolute BS
That code 4 shit is insane
I remember shooting a scene where the whole crew has to run through the woods. We set up under a beehive... The shot worked.
7:29 wait, this man wasn't an actor?
Several of these aren’t bloopers at all, and were definitely scripted.
Lego movie best blooper ever blind reactions get it ha
okbbye.... I guess
The children in Kindergarten Cop are hilarious. It's actually like Creature Comforts level of mundane with innocent but adult hilarity :p
You managed to do what so many content creators fail to do: you promised bloopers, you explained them, and you showed them. It sounds stupidly simple, but so many videos are just people TALKING about scenes and not showing them. So thank you!
0:32 it clearly was in the script because they filmed it from two angles.
McConnahey and Woody Harrelson should do a movie together. Something cool.
7:07 r u kidding😂
Was expecting to see George C. Scott's  scene as General Turgidson in the war room of "Dr. Strangelove" where he falls down.
“And what the hell is that smell AHHHHHHHHHH”
Ya really like to edit the thumbnails to get people to click for boobies. Way to go
The one time I watched Dazed and Confused I laughed so hard at that because it really just was too good. Every car guy I know who have leather seats ask everyone to take out their keys from their back pocket. So yeah "Watch the leather, Man 😂"
I'm in the business and a lot of these are made up!
4:33 that is *not good* tho
were's the big titties?
So if anyone ever falls down in a movie it was an accident? Got it.
This video is some fake BS.  They just made this stuff up.
Nobody talking about the kids talking about their sex machine of a father and that one of their dads stares at vaginas all day long?? 😭😭
1:43 lol this is gold!
I’m calling BS on some of these.   Independence Day, Kindergarten cop especially.
"The most memorable scene in 'The Wolf of Wall Street' might be the sequence in which Matthew McConaughey and Leonardo Di Caprio"... think they are special beings and can do whatever they want to earn their millions.
Whatever
Arnold Shwarze who!... 🤨
Many of the scenes were intended improvisations, more than actual bloopers.
Paul Reubens was a gift.
That wasn’t the best scene in Wolf of Wall Street.
source: I MADE IT UP
These are amazing!
The commentary is pretty fucking shit next time just play the clips ok
Farts add realism that's for sure.
gotta watch mystery men again
Harrisolon Ford: "I have never seen this coat before in my life."
I’m not buying the kindergarten cop kids and saying what their fathers do being unscripted. Please. 🙄🫤
Things like that are what makes movies good. It's a slice of real life in a film.
Fake
Lol ciggy to the face/eye must suck
Baldwin wanted all the smoke lol
Was it necessary to make Scarlett Johannsons t!ts grow on the thumbnail? Dislike committed.
Yes, all of these are improvised and they casually had all the cameras where they should and took multiple takes. Like in Will Smith dragging the alien, first a wide shot and the next one is from next to the parachute...
I love these kind of things. I did not see some of the movies, but I laughed nearly at everything in this video, well done, thank you.
Blooper; definitions. 1. an embarrassing error. Not all of these clips can be qualified as embarrassing errors.
That Scarlett Johansson bit is a little frightening.  There could be so many more female serial killers . . . just sayin'!
Love the Han Solo one.
The kids talking abot their parents lol. That proves that all good things in fiction come from reality. Real life can be just as weird and funny as a movie.
7:25 ah c'mon dude, have you seen the movie?!! It is absolutely impossible for someone to neglect the cameraman in all those scenes, heck some of guys even presented "full combat mode" in the nude scenes, walking through the water, just before they were sucked into the alien "meatgrinder" and disappeared, only leaving their skin behind to be used by the aliens.  Fun fact: Scarlett Johansson did this independent, [very] low budget movie for almost free, because she liked the storyline, and to do a nude movie, showing that not all big movie stars looks like a million $$ with their clothes off - she showed her cellulite, her sagging breasts, and her tummy, proving she's just an ordinary human being, with the same "flaws" as the rest of us.    She has always criticized Hollywood and the medias for promoting an image that causes unhealthy diets and eating disorders among women. In an essay she wrote for The Huffington Post, where she encouraged people to maintain a healthy body, she stated that nobody remained the same, we all change throughout life, and the ideal of the perfect woman promoted by Hollywood and the media, was false and harmful to especially young girls.
If punchin out was an improvisation why the shot was so perfect? They put camera in the perfect angle by coincidence? Or after improvisation they did double take with closeup?
How do you know that these were improvised?
Hardly any of these are improvised. Don't be so gullible.
At the end of Terminator 2, Arnold Schwarzenegger mistakenly thought the scene was over and pointed his thumbs up as he lowered himself into the molten metal. The director liked this gesture and the scene was included in the film.
So you are telling us falling from the skyscraper roof was for real?
Sad that you left out (7:50) Leo's confused look, when McConaughey starts pounding his chest. Leo is obviously looking at the film crew, when his character shouldn't have any reason to look at the other restaurant patrons. It really reveals the scene to be a blooper of sorts.
Knight’s Tale is best for me. But knowing Slavic sense of humor, extras might have done this on purpose. 😂
98% of this video is straight up bs 💀
My doesn’t Scarlett Johansson ever pull up and try to lure me in 🤨
*JESUS CHRIST IS COMING!* The great solar eclipse in America was a warning from God! These are the last days! We are seeing an increase in earthquakes like never before, WW3 has begun even though the main media ain't reporting (look at what's going on in the Middle East). The Euphrates River is drying up! The moon is turning to blood (NASA claims hematite, a form of rust is the cause). They are now saying bird flu will be 1000 times worse than COVID! Prices of food have gone up or are scarce due to natural disasters.   We are now experiencing unpredictable weather. Animals are behaving strangely. The technology of “The Mark Of The Beast” is here... people are already paying with just a swipe of their hand (RFID chip implanted). The Pope is converging religions and blessing same-sex marriage (going against God). Increase in Wickedness & lawlessness  (Read 2 Timothy 3).   So much is happening!! *Bible Prophecies* are coming to pass at an alarming speed!! *Please brothers & sisters Repent while there is still time!!*   “Listen!” Jesus says: “I Am coming soon, and I will bring my reward with me, to give to each person according to what he has done” - Revelation 22:12   So Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and He Will Appear a Second Time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for Him. -Hebrews 9:28
SCHWARZ WHAT
actually Peter Jackson debunked the myth about Ian hitting his head, that was a planned scene the was no other reason for that shot to be set up
Was it just some magnets holding the clock machine on the wall in the Joker?
I hardly believe that at least 30% of these scenes were improvised. But it’s not true. 2-3% may be. But I still think that all of them were staged
How the hell do you jump to another building expecting to not miss the catch fall 3 stories and survive the fall?
Improvisations are not the same as bloopers.
You said, "When he entered Bilbos hobbit hole!"
The sex machine line from Kindergarten Cop was absolutely not improvised. The twins talked about being told to say that line and how their dad was so happy with it on the recent reunion video with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
I like these but when it’s multiple angles and takes across a moment it’s obvious that it was in the script.
“F*ck the shrimp” absolutely killed me🤣
Robin Williams damn it fuck the shrimp 😂😂😂😂😂😂
When you don't know the difference between a blooper and improv....
I would like to think I'm not stupid enough (or horny enough) to be seduced by a random woman pulling up in a car like that and telling me to jump in the back. But if it was ScarJo.... man, I'm only human!
2:02 I need more proof that those 2 lines from Kindergarten Cop were improvised.   No way
Feel bad for laughing at the horse kick
the ending part: runners or sprinters at the olympics tap right below their eyes for an adrenaline shot
Scarlett broke many hearts that day.
I know that Ian McKellen is a good actor,but that's just how I react when I get hit on the head☺️
The End of Watch one is fucking brilliant. What a shot to get.
I just realized that I would be in horrible danger if Scarlett Johansson pulled up in a van and asked me to get in, because I'm probably not saying no.
"this is why we never have sex" killed me 😂
The absolute funniest part is A Knight's Tale when 2 of the extras are about to cheer, but nobody else does, so they pretend they were just scratching their head LMAO
that buster keaton "blooper" is so obviously fake
Leonardo de caprio asked Martin scorsesi to add Mathew's ritual to the scene.
Chewing handing to it Han and shaking his head: "Jesus, humans always just leave their trash everywhere."
falls off a building  ha thats funny  xD good old days
That cigarette flick has me on the floor
Nuclear wessels, my favourite.
Bloopers with several angles.. o_0
so wait, for the under the skin one, are they legally allowed to use the footage if the people weren't told it was a movie?
It feels illegal to know code 4
Some of these are 💯 written in and then quoted as improv because it’s cool.
0:30 you can not convince me that was an accidental. we was accidentaly punching the thingy while TWO cammeras were perfectly focusing on the thingy. cmon, we are not that stupid. cmon.
Under the skin 7:24
Tom: Did you fuckin fart? Rain Man: Definitely definitely definitely farted. 😂😂😂
Wow that scene from captain Phillips was improvised? That scene put the movie over the top. Chills during that scene.
xD
Omg i LOVE that Will Smith line!😂😂 And the candy bar in Die Hard!
7:29 So the movie is more of a “How to” guide. Step 1: BE SCARLETT JOHANSSON
2:50 This one genuinely made my day! 🤣😁😆😭HAHAHAHAHAA!!!
4:04 What if he writes it in braille?
Oopsie!! Poopsie!!#°•.(SpeedPet)
wtf is this crappy ai voice. Did you even try with it?
Im sorry but I honestly cant believe that all of these were mistakes.
I was there for the scene in Gettysburg. It happened spontaneously but the cameras weren’t rolling. They asked everyone to do it a second time and got it on camera.
the scene with tom hanks was brilliant
When she says "this is why we never have sex," you can see her lip twist up at the end like she is trying to suppress a smirk.
If you would just talk less, this video would have been better, not talking at all would leave the context, so just talk less and turn the damn volume down
7:06 Wait a second..,. Buster Keaton did this jump for real??? Safety wires didn't exist back then, right? So WTF?! :o
under the skin one was shocking.....
I'm glad the thumbnail was actually part of the video :p
Will who
That general lee sh*t, the nostalgia for slave owning is really crazy
Know the difference between blooper and improvisation.
Code 4 was a good tip for them getaway drivers
Fake. Everything is scripted. Even real life is fake.
Oh yeah, totally adlibbed that punching out line followed by punching the clocking in machine off the wall, they just had the second camera shot set up ready for that for absolutely no reason...🤡
That clock punch scene is pure plagiarism. Jackie Earl Haley first did it (and did it better) in Breaking Away in 1979.
1936 💀
Nobody warned Will Smith is just too funny! He's in the middle of a desert that stinks and he didn't know that 😂😂 much like nobody warned him about the Karen he married.
*_"Now you could end the scene there, but if you leave the camera rolling..."_*
Joaquin Pheonix is legit out of his f#*%+%* mind
Robin Williams slipped on the floor in The Birdcage kitchen scene because the slime from the dropped shrimp from previous takes wasn't cleaned off the floor.
Bro imagine getting lured into a van by ScarJo
Before Jackie Chan and Tom Cruise there was Buster Keaton who did all his own stunts. He made silent movies more interesting.
This is why we stay in character. Lol  She really lured a bunch of men into a car with her? What a temptress!🥰
bro casually said "arnold schwarzenigger"
If the jocker was not supposed to punch the clock, then y they had a second camera.
I guess we have a different definition of 'blooper' because about half of these aren't bloopers...
what is a nuclear wessle? never heard of such a thing ...i fell of my chair it was so funny!
Imagine getting picked up by Scarlet Johansson.
7:23
The drunk car scene is definitely the most memorable in wolf of wall street 😂 close tie would be *"GET OFF DA PHONE!!!"*
7:50 - I ca assure you, the chest-thumping scene was NOT the most memorable scene from "Wolf of Wall Street".    You must have missed every scene with Margot Robbie.   🙄
If the clock punching was unscripted why was there a 2nd angle shot?
1:53 arnold who?
Oh my God. She got a nice rack.
1:40 the man forgot his jacket seems on his face
Hi, is anyone else from Chzech republic? 😁
80% of these are not true. The rest are BS.
"He missing the jump was not intentional, and decided to keep it because it was hilarious" So he survived?
two camera angles and a cut makes me think this wasn't the first take on the clock punching
my penis too is too good to cut!
7:31 some scenes did look like real life situations, or it was just great acting in some scenes i thought. Nice. there is a scene in wolf of wallstreet where a woman just disappears. I will upload it soon, she just poof into thin air
I had heard about the Scarlett Johansen thing. I told my wife, and she said, "Dude, if you DIDN'T try to get with that woman, I would divorce you for being so stupid."
I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life supporting Joaquin Phoenix. I hope I never have to work with him.
1:51 🤨
Good stuff here, but once again I must point out the Captain Phillips scene. The corpsman's initial "You're welcome.", is so freaking genuine and truthful it broke me. Makes sense she's an actual corpsman.
How come the will smith scene was improvised if it has 2 different camera angles?
Fart bloopers are eternally funny. Dustin in the phone booth muttering fart...fart...
7:29 and this is how Bryan Cranston was discovered
It doesn’t matter how bad you feel or what kind of day you’re having go home and watch Robert Williams movie you’ll feel 100 times better I promise
No way that Kindergarten Cop scene is unscripted.
The lady in Star Trek did a great job!
If him punching. The  fucking clock. Was not in the fucking script. How did they prep and light and shoot it. From two different angles. Ur telling me after he did that the director said cut. Lets shoot that again from a different angle? If so, thats not a blooper, its a moment of improv that they Spent time lighting and directing photography for. Ugh. Orrrrrrrr. Wud that be a huge waste of time and obviously both those shots were pre prepared. You imbeciles.
Wow, they really hit Scarlett with the ugly stick my Lord
Mother, may we see "Cucumbers in the Cellar" at the theater today in our new school blue uniforms? It'll be fun! Jimmy will be there and  his brother Timmy too: all ready for fun with their dad's stolen gun!
Leslie Mann always looks like AI
The actors who do it on purpose are legends
Arnold what?
If Scarlett pulled up in a free candy van and told me to get in, tell my mother she raised me better but I jumped in anyway
I din’t believe all of these lines were unscripted, i.e the twin girls, line about “sex machine.”
There’s improvising and then there’s falling 30 ft from a rooftop and improvising
In the UK Rishi Sunak was never meant to be elected as Prime Minister but the Conservatives thought it would be a good laugh, so let him stay. The rest is history.
Clickbait, the thumbnail isnt a blooper, it was a hidden camera
Stop doing ads in the middle of the videos. Dumbest thing ever.
I have not seen any of those movies.. Except the one with Scarlett Johansson (thumbnail) which was horrible and traumatizing.
It makes me imagine ALL of the really funny bloopers that had to be cut because they didn't fit the movie or the character.
Fun fact: 50% of these "facts" are completely made up
Matthew McConeeky is such cringe 🙄
I don’t believe the punching-out was improvised in Joker, they had a 2nd camera set-up directly below it ffs
hot thumbnail
That fart haha
Di Caprio's hand injury in Django is by far the most epic improvisation scene ever. Too bad is not in the list
4:48 Not the last time he dropped the ball lol
That "f*ck the shrimp" felt too real. Now I know why
oh no poor horse :(
2:39 a knights tale... the two ladies in the back were all ready to go for it, and then held back, lol !
Half of these are absolutely scripted and not a happy accident. If people knew how much went into filming they would know there isn’t just random made up parts which make final cut
Another good one was in The Outsiders (1983) when Matt Dillon fell off his chair during the scene where he's harassing Cherry (Diane Lane) at the drive-in
Wow that warmup ritual sounds like autism stimming
When I first watched “under the skin” I immediately knew these were real interactions. It’s too obvious but makes it creepy in a way
AI-generated video?
2:04 damn their mother married to a sex machine
2:49 this is just brilliant now XD
1:46 man i actually smiled at this scene. and now it's even funnier
Bullshit
Pro tip: when you put two cameras on a scene, with one perfectly angled up to the time clock on the wall, you know he's going to punch it because you planned for that. With that setup, there's a literal zero percent chance that he decided to punch it out of the blue, after those cameras started rolling. If it wasn't already in the script then what almost certainly happened is that he had the idea, he said to the director, "How about I punch this thing right off the wall", and the director thought it was a great idea.
Holy crap! That bit from Knight's Tale was ad libed?
@TheLaughPlanet GOOD JOB, folks! 👌
Morgan Freeland is a legend
I don't believe you on some of these
In the French Connection, during a chase scene, Gene Hackman's car is T-boned by another car. That was not supposed to happen. They filmed the scene early on a Sunday morning in New York and blocked off the streets where the chase was to occur. One driver, not connected to the movie, somehow got through the barricades and creamed Hackman's car while they were filming. The director, William Friedkin, kept it in the final cut.
Why do men fart so much?
You left out Blazing Saddles: "You know -- Morons". And then Dustin Hoffman almost got hit by a car and said, "Hey, I'm walking here!"
7:33 hahaha *nervous laughter*
6:25 My favorite scene in the movie just got a 100x funnier. 😂😂😂
5:32 this was brilliant, it took me a minute to figure what she had just done
Fake how he now that😮
Funny how some of the bloopers had two camera angles in sequence.
I want to say punchout gag from Joker was actually planned. It looked like it was very poorly glued on and there is literally no residue or any sign of wear on the back wall
4:13 Oh my God that is funny!  I love how he stays in character and brushes himself off like he's annoyed at the wall for getting in his way.  Bill Murray is amazing.
Isn't it a warmup ritual Leonardo does and Matthew asked him to use it?
The Gandalf scene is a great improv . I often wondered .

Sure? That everything was really the same? The underneath shot of the camera in the Joker scene has the focus on the machine, either it was re-shot or I didn't understand that the improvisation was to knock the machine off its mount.  Will Smith is surprised by the smell of the Salt Lake in Utah? Ok, he must not have travelled far from Scientology headquarters. Satire again in that respect. Harrison Ford doesn't look like he's confused, he looks like he's improvising being confused. With Mystery Men - maybe, but the 'now famous line' can't be. 'Excuse me' is rather unreferential, especially from a film that unfortunately(!) far too so few people know.
Uncle Billy in ‘It’s a Wonderful Life.’ He calls from off-screen ‘I’m all right!’ after an unscripted crash. In ‘The Outsiders’ when some of them are at the drive-in movie, Dallas is bugging Cherry and he falls out of his seat. Ponyboy laughs and looks off-screen thinking the director will call’Cut!’ Coppola allows the scene to continue….
I don’t believe half of these.
I'm gay! I'll say it for you Shuler. Those two are Fruit-Roll-Ups. 😂
06:15 hard to believe that...
If those people weren’t actors I’m surprise no one realized they were talking to Scarlett Johansson??????
cigarette in face was hillarious lol.
Joquain stole his line from the movie Breaking Away!
06:44 This was not "improvised;" she merely followed standing operating procedure. The questions she asked are the same questions she asked everyone she treats (actually making it more "scripted" than "improvised'). She was not paid for her lines because she was a U.S. Navy sailor, on a ship, at sea, and therefore not allowed to receive SAG pay.
I see thumbnail I click
The men in under the skin were actors.
What the hell celebrities actually fart 🤢
2:44 this should have been a flashback scene in game of thrones, when Rob Baratheon was the only guy rooting for Ned.
That's crazy the men in Under the Skin didn't know they were being filmed.  You can feel their eagerness and contained excitement at Scarlett's forward questions and luring them in.
The one about the supposed extra in the Star Trek movie makes me skeptical. Why would the script call for a direct question to an extra who was then not scripted to respond? I smell BS. EDIT: Ok, the slightest research shows I'm wrong. It's Layla Sarakalo. Chekov and Uhura approach several people on the street, inquiring about the wessels, and they each remain silent and just look momentarily confused before going about their business. Until Sarakalo responds as shown in this video.
1:51
Thank God we don't have "Smell - o - Vision".. Yet!
Die Hard is one of my favorite movies of all-time and that scene with the candy bar always makes me laugh because I know I'd be doing the same thing in his position! 😂🤣😂
I always thought the smell was comin from the alien in independence day
*Nuclear wessels*
Idk why, but I completely lost it over the Morgan Freeman clip. It just struck me as even more hilarious that it’s an outtake. 🤣
Joaquin Phoenix is kinda weak.
That scene in captain phillips with tom hanks was one of the powerful and incredibly real scenes in cinematic history. And the fact this is how it was shot explains why. ❤ thank you
This is just pure and utter BS
It's Hollywood and they can't even afford a bed with proper springs.
How do you do this lust and not include dicaprios glass breaking cut hand scene in Django unchained or Kurt Russell destroying a priceless guitar in Hateful eight?
That kid that says boys have peanuts and girls has virginia will always be remembered as that kid for the rest of his life. He is probably 40 now,
A lot of these are bullshit
Not sure how many of these would count as "Bloopers," but it was a good list otherwise.
Like if ScarJo tried to entice me into a van I'd say no?  Hell with that.  I'm in.
7:57 I don’t think anyone doubted that wasn’t scripted.
So what we are watching isn't really acting. Acting is just being yourself.
2:56 wow. This was so natural and the edit was awesome.
2:06 that was real answers? Lmao
1:31 that hit though kkkkkkk
Geysers and deserts... sulfur smell. Lava. Brimstone.
Cancer
Speaking of Dustin, what about the scene in Tootsie where the wood swing cracks / breaks? That hsa gootta have been for real.
I have seen just about every film here and luv them all. - great stuff!
7:22 Under the Skin - dudes were for real? That is crazy, how could they not know it's SJ ?
0:33 How can it be a blooper/improvised if they took two angles of it?
What the Gandalf one wasn't scripted? That is so fitting for him being a tall wizard in the hobbit home. A classic.
Poor horse
robert baratheon at 2:55
I'm impressed with End of watch improvised scene
I KNEW IT, the Bill Murray fall in Scrooged I knew that wasn’t scripted as soon as I seen it. His foot clearly loosed grip and he slips.
Making boobs bigger in the thumbnail 😂
Most of these stories are made-up and untrue.
Well, lets face it.  It doesn't take much to confuse Harrison Ford.
No way Joker punching the clock was not scripted considering the camera angle was set for it!
I think you said "the director found it hilarious and decided to keep it in" about 15 times in this video
The fact you found all these bloops and could add context is outstanding.
clickbait titlecard
bro imma keep it with you I didn’t understand the word you said but i hear you are struggling. I hope you can make it through. Love ya ❤
Il never forgive Scarlett Johansson for having tht boob reduction surgery
but why male models?
The lesson here is if something goes wrong with a take.. don't stop 'til they call cut.
0:48 Haha ouch, right in the freaking eye!
0:48 Haha ouch, right in the freaking eye!
I liked the fart parts. You should do a run-down of real fart movie stuff.
Did you make ScarJo's boobs intentionally bigger in the thumbnail?? Crazy!!
7:22 Under The Skin - one of the worst movies ever.
@1:53 Listen at .50 playback speed.. He tried to slide that in🤔😒🤮
Nuclear Wessels?
Was there something actually scripted in the Force Awakens?
7:36 This fart scene is so fucking hilarious.
how do we even know these are all real bloopers?
there is no way thats the most remembered scene from the wolf of wall street,  i cant thing of a few i remember and thats not one of them lol
that morgan freeman bit, was the funniest piece of dialog in the whole movie!
that "what is she doing" is such a dad thing to do right after the fart as he's "pretending" he didnt fart xD
Very dubious about 'punching the clock' @0:31 being unscripted.... We got 2 camera angles of the clock that just happened to be punched off the wall.... And who tf risks punching the crap out of a solid bit of kit like that unless they knew it was going to give away
Under the Skin is amazing
The scene in the hobbit was in the book.
Should have included the graveyard scene with Barry Keoghan in Saltburn.
This is funny 7:00 when you watch die hard, you see that candy bar before you see him walk up to it, my mind when watching was exactly where the actors mind was "grab a candy!".
What are 'Nuclear Wessells' at 5':25" ?
My comment was improvised.
Yeah, the clock punching seeemed totally improvised with the two camera set up
The confederate soldiers all cheering for their beloved general was indeed an epic scene in the movie.
The rule is, you stay in character till the director calls 'cut'.   In 'The Shining', Jack Nicholson is knocking down things off of tables (metal rings?), and hits the camera...but he keeps going, and it stayed in the film.
"completely improvised punch out joke" while there's a camera directly pointed at the clock out station
hgfhgfhgfhgfhgfd
LIES!! the kid that says "my dad is a gynecologist" is Miko Hughes who was born in Apple Valley, California, the son of Mary (née Phelps) and John Hughes, a special effects technician, so... not his dad real job... just more clickbait
Chewbacca not only astonished Harrison but the other two actors too lmao, they probably were like "did he just fk up the scene?"
What a great video!!
I Django Unchained when the barman hits his head with the lamp, i think that was not scripted.
Will Smith is a joke. He smells trash.
Nice work making the tits bigger in the thumbnail
I doubt the clock punching was unscripted. The camera is pointing directly at it.
Turpulence, not turbulence.
This was quite good! 🌟
That woman in the Star Trek 4 scene is a genius
I’m PRETTY certain the most memorable scene in Wolf of Wall Street didn’t even have Matthew McConaughey in it 🤣
This response was never in the script.
hard Potter is bad
Now I want to watch wolf of Wallstreet.
great video😄
Woah, that fact about Under the Skin just blew my mind - that's why it seemed so real, it was.
Never realised it was the salt flats the smell came from.
"Watch the leather man".  Love that line.  Used to used it myself in high school.
Imagine being picked up by Scarlett Johansson. I would get in the van even knowing I will be killed.
Dustin Hoffman yelling "hey! Im walking here!" In Tootsie is the best Blooper.
The Usual Suspects one is crazy
Leonardo DiCaprio, animal abuser.
I love how you can clearly tell that chris pratt dropped the orb on purpose
"I forgot to punch out!" Was probably the funniest most relatable joke in Joker 😂
I'm wondering how it's known that these are all "bloopers." Are they?
holly shit Joacquin is a fucking machine transformer robot that he fucking punched that thing so hard and didnt hurt his hand even :O
The vent scene with Paul Rudd was so... _rudde_ .
4:33 Yeah Lee flogged a little black girl for fishing so Lee can go F himself...go look it up
Yup
"Our mom says that our dad is a real sex machine" 💀
The thumbnail Views
In that last scene from Wolf of Wall Street, we don't see it here but it's quite obvious when DiCaprio looks straight at the director off camera because he's wondering what is going on with this.
Thanks!
bs
How the he'll do brine shrimp end up in a desert every year?
I don't know why I can't stop laughing at Leonardo DiCaprio kicking that horse in the face. I'm pretty sure it's not that funny!
I'll never be able to look at Will Smith the same again, after you-know-what. It ruins it for me, to know what he is capable of. That was all I could think of while watching the above clip of him in Independence Day.
Props to the horse for staying in character
Clickbait thumbnail and annoying accordion music.
I love it when other actors would look around waiting for the director to shout cut but they wouldnt.
1:31 I like this scene.
Where are the good Samaritans that add a timestamp to the thumbnail pick of the video so we don't end up listening to this boring guy yap Edit: I'll do it myself 7:27 Not worth it we were fooled about it's dimensions
Very entertaining video. Thanks for the laughs.
I know it's not as unusual today, but seeing a high-profile America actress in a low-budget British film in sorroundings that you would see in your daily life does seem a bit surreal.
I think these things are what makes a great actor. There are moments where laughing with the cast and retaking are great for morale like in Star Trek TNG the whole cast were constantly on the floor in hysterics but in these moments where they roll with it and don't laugh but pretend it's meant to happen - that is brilliant acting. When Worf says "I never played with Boys" it must have taken them 20 re takes to get them to stop laughing and knowing that makes me happy when I watch it lol.
Good stuff
If the joker punching outscene wasn't planned how did they have a low angle camera setup
1:48 but its a dogshit movie so nobody gives a fuck. Stormtrooper door bump is more memorable and beloved of a blooper.
Ah yes, the induced cult to a made-up "art" : acting. In other words, just "being" lol. Can't get any more stupid than this
Bro has to learn the difference between improvisation and blooper. (But still a good video)
In the Knights Tale one, you can see one of the extras start to lift her arms up to cheer but then puts them down when nobody else cheers at first
8:04 the most memorable scene is when they take ludes and he tries to drive the lambo to stop Jonah hill from talking
1:56 - 2:07 ....Wait what?
Honestly, I don't know how openly farting in front of everybody is funny. It's annoying & disgusting AF
I should have realized that the Will Smith scene was a blooper. Isn't that right, Chris?
Pov all shit movies
I love you 💕
"The clocking in machine."  I can't even. 🤣
1:50 Arnold Schwarze WHAT!!! yea you got that one off 😂
Haha we all know the most famous  scene in wolf of wall Street boys 😅
In the scene from “The Joker” I believe Joaquin was influenced by a scene from “Breaking Away” where Jackie Erle Haley punched the clock before he started his first day of work
Improve in movies is a gift for the audience and a curse for most on set(unless it's a comedy).........gotta love it though
Oh yes, they were not actors. They just randomly approached Scarlett Johansson sitting in a van and not recognize her.
You left out the one where Jane Hathaway slipped on a bench in The Princess Diaries.
2:56 i love this movie but this is insane 😂😂😂
Are these all lies or just most of them?
I didnt know that was a real alien in Independence Day
LOL... LOVE IT
So, you photoshopped the Scarlett Johansen image to use as a thumbnail? Moron.
Liked - Subscribed - Shared - Commented...  Well done!  Interesting, trimmed and succinct... Just how we like it!   Thanks...
fart cene got me cracking here....
2:07 STAGED!! that lil boy acted in movies, stop lyin hollyweird. aka Blaze
Tom Cruise’s reaction to him farting had me dead. 💀 So funny. He was appalled. 😂
The cigarette in the eye was wild. The coat being picked up and handed to the dude took me out 🤣
I see what you did there
The literal punching of the time clock also occurred in the 1979 film Breaking Away.
Some of these are rehashed from your previous video, like Usual Suspects and A Knight's Tale.
Better keep olive oyl out of your dam mouth
All fake / lies.
FYI - The 'punching out' Joker blooper was actually a scripted scene in the movie Breaking Away with a fed up Jackie Earle Haley (Moocher) being reminded to 'punch out'!
No way Scarlett drew real dudes in for the movie! Could you imagine a van pulls up and Scarlett is just gassing you up.. bruh, I gotta carry a ring!
2:50 Mark deserves something for that, what a savage
i don't agree that these are improvised, I think most of em are a good director doing a very good job, not just directing but operating. But yeah, probably there are some more spontaneus moments
2:02 Hollywood, and parents should know better.
LIKE MOVING THE comment section....wtf  google!!!
Lucky for Johansson that none of those men had weapons. Had something untoward happened to her, it would have been way more serious than Alec Baldwin's accidental killing in "Rust." Hers was "Candid Camera" in a very abusive, if not misogynistic, manner.
2:07 This is my favorite scene
i came for the trap i stayed for the lore
The people who think these bloopers are actual bloopers are the peoplke who think reality TV shows are real. LMAO.. if you really think these are actual bloopers, how do you explain the shifting camera angles/cuts (like that Will Smith kick the Alien scene) These "bloopers" are cooked up by the production PR team to raise interest or rekindle interest in old movies.
Holy shit, i had no idea that guy improvised stealing the candy bar in Die Hard. That makes it even better, to me it is one of the most memorabel moments in the film.
I honestly had the idea that those scenes were real 😅
The Knights tail one is Hilarious. love that movie  ( YEAHHH 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That first claim ?. ABSOLUTELY false and obviously so.  A. You couldn't "punch" a time-clock sideways off the wall, nor could Mike Tyson, if it was fixed to the wall with anything, even Velcro. You couldn't do it with a claw-hammer. B. LOOK at the scene, slow it down. His hand isn't actually hitting anything, look at his clothing, his sleeve, the object itself . . . nothing is actually being punched. C. Look at the wall when the thing is supposedly "torn free sideways". There is not ONE scratch or mark on the wall, not a single sign that the wall has been affected, not even its paint . . . what is he supposed to have "broken free" ?. How was the five or maybe ten Kg metal object held there securely ? magic?.  There isn't even any sign of GLUE, there is just a blank wall.  FUCK people are gullible.
I read it as: "movie boobs". The thumbnail fits 😅
Brilliant!!!
@ 1.14 pure racist
These are fvck'n hilarious!
Daang never knew that the men from Under The Skin weren't actors, so that's why it looks a bit off and genuine. Now I know haha.
Oooh, an actor was spontaneous; how extraordinary! 🙄 What patronising click-bait monger wrote this shit?
Did you know that: ¿Most of these facts may be completely made up? 😅
The best actors can,.....................Recover , every time.
0:49 the fuck timeloop
Ok "Code 4" means SO MUCH MORE than 'no assistance needed'  It means 'situation under control'.  It doesn't mean you can go, it means 'i got this' roughly.  Whether or not you leave is your choice.  If someone tells you to '10-98' that is closer to no assistance needed.  Or just 'take a 98'.  Which overtly means leave.  'go 10-8' would be closer to 'leave go back on patrol' as 10-8 means 'on duty'.  10 and signal codes are a lot more complex and sadly tv and movies almost always get them wrong...
"Those men were not actors" so they just thought it was a coincidence they were talking to that girl from Lost in Translation, the Island, Iron Man 2 etc.? All movies they probably would have seen as dudebros?
So I don't believe the whole kindergarten cop one because i just looked up miko hughes parents and his dad was a special effects technician not a GYN. So im not inclined to believe this one
fake
Who is your daddy and what does he do?
that Captain Phillips one is so cold; shows how good of an actor Hanks really was in it.
Yeah but didn't Scorsese see McConaughey do the exercise before shooting and ask him to include him in the scene? If so, how does it qualify as a blooper? If not....how does it qualify as a blooper lol?
Leonardo breaking the glass in Django and keeping on needs to be on this list.
JUST PLAY THE VIDEO AND STAY QUIET
This is just a veiled attempt at a Joker2 ad 😡
The first scene is so authentic it's why I watch the movie
🧢
improvs are not bloopers. next.
https://youtube.com/shorts/bnLtrob1Ld4?si=op7ShsrBNGD4nlBf
I think that's the kid 2:06 who is in my nightmares after Pet Cemetery, after he cut the guys Achilles tendon with a razor.
Apparently he’s still running.
Well the wolf of wallstreet was planned but it was put in cus the director liked it and asked him to do in the shot
Pop a like if you'd love to pop out a huge fart in a phone booth with Tom Cruise?
There is improv and there is bloopers. There is a difference
I believe about 1% of the supposed 'these bloopers weren't meant to happen' video.
Good video.  Thanks
6:32  She's Navy, that means Corpsman, not Medic.
5:26  5:31  Karma
Dumb & Dumber had a bunch. "Want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?" and "No way. We've landed on the moon!"
1:54  First thing that went through my mind,   "That's what my dad says to my mom when they're alone in their room, I always hear him ask her, "Who's your daddy, who's your daddy, who's your daddy"
Half of these aren't even bloopers, they were always supposed to be improv.
Richard was a music producer right? A lucky one, from what I read. How is he built his empire before the virgin groups? What are his habits?
Or Leonardo Dicaprio in Django unchained, when he smashes is hand on the glass, breaking it.  Leo REALLY did cut his hand, but carried on with the scene.
That was really cool. You picked great scenes.  I can’t believe that “extra” got away with the improv.  She’s also way too pretty for that to be totally true.. :)
I bet McConaughey is fun to get stoned with
yeah idk if i believe some of these...
4:13 IT'S ONE OF THE FUNNIEST PARTS OF THE MOVIE I STILL LAUGH AT IT TO THIS DAY I KNEW IT WASN'T SCRIPTED BUT IT WAS SO FUNNY I also can't believe they let him say I thought you were Richard Pryor and kept it in the movie
Legit thought young Paul Reubens was Jeremy Allen White for a second there
2:54 It was at this moment Mark Addy became Robert Baratheon
I miss Robin Williams.😢
5:03 Not only did he keep the scene in, but he referenced it 11 years later, in The Hobbit, when Gandalf once again (or maybe "previously" is more accurate) hits his head in the exact same spot.
The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life throught Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 6:23 You and I broke the law and Jesus paid the fine. God demonstrates his own love for us in this, while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:8 Believe and repent today! The consequences are eternal.
This is just nonsense, look at Joker, obviously it wasn't a blooper and they literally had different angles which required different camera setups.
As usual, the source for half of these bloopers that were kept in is "because I made them the fuck up"... I mean, sometimes it does make a scene better knowing that it was improvised, other times, however, it is just good, scripted or not, and such clips belittle the significance of actors' acting.
Did you fuckin fart Raymond?
It is now 4:20 MDT.✳️🪴❇️
"My dad is a carnigologist"  🤣
Survived another blooper that made it in to the movie compilation without someone mentioning the LOTR helmet kick
Go slow speed and pause at 0:50 damn straight into his eye lol
I'm going to go ahead and say that some of these are fucking bullshit. There's no way Phoenix punched a complex prop off the wall of the set without being instructed to. That shit costs money and would have taken way too long to remake if they'd needed to. In Kindergarten Cop, there's no way those twins weren't scripted, or the child whose father is a gynaecologist.  People need to stop being so fucking gullible.
Damn imagine getting caught on camera hitting on scarlet Johansson
I'm not some big expert on this stuff and don't know too much about making of these movies, but understand, when it's said it's not scripted, it doesn't mean that it's improvised by the actor on the spot. It's thought out before the take. For example the punching in the Joker, notice the different camera prepared for the shot of the machine. The Birdcage with Robin Williams is on the spot for example. Or the famous: "I'm walkin heeere!! I'm walkin heere!"
1:51 what did he saaaay
The Usual Suspects is one of my favorite movies and I always thought the cigarette hitting him looked 100% real lol
Nope, CHRIS PRATT later confirmed that he did that. he made it look like that but he deliberately did that.
Let's talk about Buster Keaton one lol :v
Independance day kicking the alien is such a ridiculous scene, as if you would in real life.
will smith is a violent person indeed, to human or alien as we have seen.
The Paul Rudd one makes me lose respect for him, just disgusting and disrespectfull.
So many of these aren’t true
Nice, a lot of these types of videos have the narrator talking over the clip as it plays and usually talking for way too long too. This guy kept it short and actually showed the clips.
Harrison Ford makes sucha face when he picks up the parka....🤣🤣🤣
Miko Hughes was the cutest kid
Harrison Ford is a twat. Who knew?
Pause at 7:30 and then look at the thumbnail…….you made the boobies bigger to get the click……it worked
turpulence.  Seeing that bad caption version compels me every time, as that's a dem fine word.
Garbage day
Sheen deserved that applause. That movie was amazing.
The two about farting I think are priceless.  Farting is always funny, and only better when it's real and others keep it real instead of breaking character.
Yeah, Will Smith probably never smelled anything like fish.
Under The Skin was a fascinating, disturbing film. Like a dark dream.
That's Wolf's absolute worst scene.
You, eh... photoshopped that thumbnail quite a bit, eh? Scarlett Johanson doesn't look like that in the video, bud.
This so fun! I didn't know 90% of this. This is what great acting is made of. Just keep going with the flow.
The moment the kid said "clocking in machine," I knew this would be crap.
Three others missed here  The Exorcist: Linda Blair’s famous projectile peas soup vomit was supposed to hit Jason Miller in the chest. Instead, it hit him right in the face and his angered reaction was genuine.  The Hateful Eight: Kurt Russel was supposed to smash a prop replica of the 1870s Martin acoustic guitar loaned to the production by the Martin museum. Instead, he accidentally smashed the real one. Jennifer Jason Leigh's shocked reaction to this is genuine.  Django Unchained: When Leonardo DiCaprio smashes his hand on the dinner-table, he accidentally crushed glass with his palm and did really begin to bleed. He ignored it, stayed in character, and continued with the scene and the injury was written into the scene.
As good as that "punching out" scene is, it's really scary if you think about it. Oh well, i don't have to work with him.
Most of these “bloopers” would be better termed improv.
Im not! Its the springsz.
"Those men were not actors!" (shows the bus scene where it's all actors and makes it the thumbnail... and qualifies it as bloopers somehow?!)
Random dudes not knowing it's a movie: "Best day ever! This hot girl that looks like Scarlett Johansson is trying to pick me up for sex!" Those same random dudes not knowing it's a movie: "Wait, so that really was Scarlett Johansson and I'm not going to get to have sex with her?!?!?! Worst day ever...of all time..."
Buster Keaton's stunts were insane , and all for a laugh , absolute legend . Sometimes the ad libs are spot on and many writers would have loved to have owned those lines .
MORE AI CONTENT?! You are a waste
Fuck the shrimp too good lol
Arnold who?
Could you imagine being one of those guys having a young Scarlett asking you to get in her van..............................bro
Mark Addy? I thought it was Cousin
0:37 oh yea they just happened to have a camera a t that angle. Bollocks.
Yeah the punch out was "improvised" then how come there's like 3 angles of a prop being destroyed when it wasn't supossed to be destroyed huh?
Thumbnail was a damn lie
😂😂😂 Wonderful! Just what I needed this morning! ❤❤❤
Did Mr. Phoenix hurt himself by punching the time clock?
The ability the actors can have to stay in character and roll with an improv scene or an accident like a slip and you find out they weren't part of the script is  a true credit to them
And I remember Robert Patrick improvised stepping through the metal grid and James Cameron decided to leave that shot in the film. All right.
Great job! I love this stuff.😊
Never fart while seggg 😂
No way those kids actually get told they're dad is a "sex machine"😂no way that's not a scripted line
So who photoshopped scarlets boobs ? Wow..ok ...lame..haha..😂
Yea.... Bullshit on 90% of these
1:53 Arnold Schwarze-WHAT??
7:30 Scarlett Johansson
The extras cheering for a real life pos (Lee) is disappointing. Why do the people who believe that way seem to not want to educate over hate?
Farts are real.
This is the best collection of these I’ve seen. Nice work!
That navy medics life was changed for the worst. Mainly from inside the navy. Or so the story goes
For those who love TheLaughPlanet, the cryptocurrency $YGG [YGG Coin] is going UP right NOW and could have LIMITLESS money for all people here RIGHT NOW!
bro imagine Scarlet Johanson wanting you to jump into her van for a good time lololol
i would definitely get into Scarlett Johanssons van
🎉🎉🎉llove your content
Robin Williams was the best…
That Captain Phillips scene always stood out to me. It was so realistic. Now I know why. Professionalism is better than acting any day.
Its impprtant to have that flexibility. The actor who keeps acting and the director who keeps rolling, magical things happen lol
1:44 force awakens didn't had a script in the first place.
that thumbnail with over the top boobs of scarlet.
yikes on that gettysburg nugget.
5:23 what is a wesel?
I love these outtakes! Many of them I've never seen before (a plus!!) and you didn't waste my time with chatty talk inbetween. Thank you!!
Generally, actors and especially comedians are taught to stay in the scene.
The “clocking in machine?”     Time clock.     0:18
Only the silent are violent😂
The ending scene in Captain Phillips movie is insane, it shows how much of an actor Tom Hanks really is!!! The performance was one of the best performances in the entire movie!
this video is strangely familiar, yet different...   I've seen this before..
Also Dustin Hoffman improvised the line “I’m walking here!” in Midnight Cowboy. He also literally SMACKED Meryl Streep in Kramer vs Kramer…..yeah not as funny.
Those guys didn't recognize Scarlet Johansson? Jesus christ...xD
That’s so cool!! Loved it!
I have always loved bloopers from film and television.
02:41 - the better part is, that in the background the statists are starting to cheer because they dont know when he is finished and what he is saying, but then pull back in confusion 😀
So Just Humans being, Being Human Beings?   Wow!!!  So What
End of Watch was a great movie, spent a few years in law enforcement and attended a few 'end of watch' services, very very sad. Will always remember those as well as military funerals.
WTF!? How do you not include the most famous? Midnight Cowboy "I'm walking here!" ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c412hqucHKw
Great references to many iconic movies...I didn't know most of them...Thanks for the upload!
There's a difference between improv and a blooper
Chaucer is the name, writing is the game. ^^
Joaquin Phoenix decides to punch the machine so that they can have a funny blooper... prop set up crew : ah here we go again.
Again repeating the same clips.
yeah lm sure the kids comments to Arnold wasnt scripted...🙂
Half of these definitely aren't true, in many cases you can tell it is overly theatrical premeditated acting and writing for sure.
I grew up on the other side of the causeway to Antelope Island in The Great I did not realize that was where that line comes from. Feels like an inside joke with my friends from Highschool.  For a second, I liked Will Smith again.
2:55 why isn’t this a meme???
a knights tale was famous for being the worst movie ever made.
3:13 "this a fckin foam mattress!"
You dont get this that much anymore
this is why we never had sex. lmao
The Evil Dead has the most jackpot ones
0:55 That's bullshit! Brine shrimp cannot live out of water, there are none on the Bonneville Salt Flats, they live in the Great Salt Lake that doesn't dry up.
if that "punch out" thing wasnt prepared, then that clock was not set to break away.  how did he not break his hand?
Tom Cruise's fall running out of an office at the end of Collateral is real, too.  And so is Julia Roberts' laugh in Pretty Woman when Richard Gere snaps the jewelry box lid closed on her finger.
That movie was not from 1995😮
7:30 Scarlett Johansson could play Velma if she wanted
bullshit
Breaking away was better
Total Fail on the last clip. Leo begins to look around at the film crew with a "wtf?" look.
That Harrison Ford scene was probably the only genuinely clever moment in that movie. ( yeah I went there lol )
Even though he was a terrorist and a murderer in Die Hard, I really felt a sense of camraderie for Uli when he reached for the Crunch Bar. Even scumbags like chocolate. lol
You left out the scene with Matt in the Outsiders.
A lot of this is made up, very little of what happens during filming is unscripted, it's extremely expensive to film and they absolutely do not like wasting time like that, every second of the film is scripted and rehearsed to the second, and a lot of the "unscripted" scenes are simply taken credit for by actors.
a code 4 in Mexico means something else entirely, like, almost contrary hahaha
The fact about Under the Skin isn't a blooper.
In the Revenant, Tom Hardy also visibly hits the camera man during one the rope shots when he throws the bundle of furs onto a mule. You won't notice it unless your used to seeing the warp effect in premiere pro and clock the same warping around the corners and edges they used to mask the back and forth motion caused by the strike. I'm surprised no one ever talks about this.
I've seen so many of the people in under the skin in Scottish films n TV shows, they made it up that they were random public
7:01 he was the best actor in the movie mann and his scenes was always the best
Another Leonardo DiCaprio moment was in DJango. He cut his hand during an intense scene. He just looks at the cut dripping and continues, doesn't miss a beat. First time watching I was blown away. Excellent actor.
I mean… these are good when I see them. Some new ones here.
i guess we're using the term "blooper" pretty loosely here...
Improv isn’t the same thing as bloopers
The main thing I got from this video is that Hollywood has serious digestive issues.
Often wondered what Martin Sheen thought of that scene when General Lee was being cheered by his soldiers. It's an incredibly beautiful and emotional shot. The extras were all dedicated ACW reenactors and they were really in the 'zone' cheering their general.
So they had 2 cameras set up to catch the clock punch out scene?
Navy medics are called corpsmen.
loved all the scenes except for the stupid one on Wolf of wall street
Entertaining video😂
7:10 Talk about going way back in time with Buster Keaton!    Loved it, though!  Buster was a genius. o
I'm still waiting for a Mystery Men sequel. They could hunt down The Spleen's murderer.
You know half these stories are just PR bullshit
5:26 was a smart play.
The punch-out punchline was stolen ftom "Breaking Away," 1979, courtesy of the brilliant Jackie Earl Haley's Mooch. Who did it with a lot more sponteneity and class.
that excuse me is totally by luck, since he is suddenly on screen that it is kinda perfect for him to say that...
01:42 Oh wow you absolutely butchered the pronunciation of Joonas Suotamo's name.
5:20 That was a very smart and slick move and I’m glad the crew was on board since it caused the woman to have a very bad day.
Always felt that Gandalfs donk was way too real.
the people uploading these kind of videos really need to learn what a blooper is.
nice video
Annnd this is why is love Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann
i knew the medic had to be real in the tom hanks movie. that is 100% how a first responder behaves.
This is 1 of the reasons you get good actors in films. A good director lets actors act. This shows acting gold in these films.
7:25 I was like "either these men were NOT told or they bloody acted so well it looked improvised."  Well done, to everybody - it looks creepier when the woman is doing it to men LOL.
5:20 damn, that was some smart thinking
I get a kick how the Chest Thump from was improvised and it’s now used by sports teams to celebrate goals or wins.😅
Because the extra unexpectedly spoke in the Star Trek movie and it was left in, they had to get her a SAG card.  After all, it is California and unions are real there.  Having membership in the Screen Actors Guild was probably worth the impound fee to get her car back.
Yeah, I'd walk into a van with Scarlett Johansen. To hell with stranger danger
WHY ARE YOU REUSING OVER 50% OF THE CLIPS THAT YOU PUT IN A VIDEO OF THE SAME TITLE THAT YOU UPLOADED A MONTH AGO? JUST PLAIN GREED

Scarlet can lure me into her van any time!
If the first case is true, why is there an extra camera shot framing the machine perfectly?
The Navy corpsman should've gave Hanks the Silver Bullet.
Also in Voyage Home, Shatner’s line “I think he did a little too much LDS” wasn’t in the script too.
just play the d@mn clips. no one is here for you. seriously. We're not children. Just post the clips and walk away. we'll watch them. I promise.
Jackie Earle Haley punched the clock in 1979s Breaking Away https://youtu.be/UBJOszaSn8k?si=fBeYQLJWAVfeLLtE
I don't understand how the "this is 40 scene" is considered improvised when it is cut from multiple takes and camera angles
The LOTR bit isn't exactly accurate. Yes, Gandalf bumping his head wasn't scripted, but it was intentionally done by McKellen
The Morgan Freeman line is my favorite!
No long Intro, straight into the Video. Keep it up!
lol Gyllenhaal signaling them real police heli
"Im walking here! im walking!" from dustin hoffman is still probably the most iconic bit of improv ever.
_SCARLETT COULD DEPOPULATE_
would be so much better without the background music
Al Leong is legendary. I remember trying to find him in every action movie I watched as a kid.
Pretty sure this video is not correct about a lot of these.
Knowing these scenes were improvised makes them 100x better
4:22 Peter Venkman slipping on Slimer's goo.
“…except for when Leo kicked that horse in the face”.  Oh, scandal? No, he just wasn’t looking. Fair enough.
Joker was one of the greatest movies ever!
Photoshopping bigger boobs is just a cheap piece of shit Way liars try to steal from you.
Damn got some farty actors from Hollywood 😂😂😂😂
this is a really well-edited video, straight to the point with lots of amazing clips. 👍👍👍  If this was watch mojo, it would've been 30 mintues long with all voicover and less content. thanks!
wonder how many phone numbers Scarlett Johansson took away from that movie
Fuck the shrimp 😂❤😂❤ love Robin Williams
1:45 Zuunas shuu-tamo
early
in-bed farting would kill the mood
