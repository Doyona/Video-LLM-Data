Dislike this comment to like the video.
7:35 how dare you insult the King of Demons!
MUTHER FUDGER DID YOU JUST SAY DIGIMON 7:54
Holy crap, Lois! Remember the time Hollow Knight was in *insert media*?!
The hollowknight is so cute he is such a cameo character hornet is too her cute nature just fits
7:36 im weirdly disappointed that you didn't acknowledge the Phantom of the Paradise plushie
4:20 bro that 6/7
4:21 say that agian
9:46 blood vessel
4:21 6.7!??!?!?
Haak  have Hollow Knight cameos too
Why has no one talked about him saying pipplup is from digemon.
3:45  as a christian you insulted not only me but the people who believe in the bible thats messed up even if you dont belive in the bible atleast respect other peoples beliefs and the fact you called the bible 'obscured' is insane
3:22 let me tell you about indiecross
4:22 how much?
7:52 "Digimon" lol
In owlhouse, the main character owns "holler knight".
"... An obscure piece of literature known as     *The Bible*"
You said you could keep going with the references does that mean you’re gonna make a part 20 wait I just realized this video came out three years ago
7:53 10/10 ragebait.
8:44 there is one  malaysian drama use hollow knight soundtrack too but i just can t remembered it but i can guarantee it comes out in 2025
Not sure if its a full on reference- but in the Owl House season 2, episode 6: Hunting Palisman, the city of Latissa seems to resemble the Fungal Wastes in Hollow Knight. Conversely, in Hollow Knight: Silksong- there are two areas that seem worded similiarly or are based on locations from the Boiling Isles. 'Bone Bottom' (potential reference to Bonesborough) and 'The Marrow'.
Go watch indie cross 3:25
It call bug fable, I would expect some knight that is hollow
You forgot the reference in the hit indie game "Hollow Knight Silksong"
I can't wait fo see Hornet cameos and reference in future time.
within
Evangelion mentioned??? hahahaha shinji hospital scene. Shinji crank that soulja boy. hehe rei chiquita.
9:17  I'm 3 years late but the green elephant is Jotalhão, a character that often appears in these comics
Indie crossover
Why not putting the knight in smash bros
HOW FVCKING DARE YOU CALL PIPLUP A DIGIMAON??????!?!!!!!!!!! PIPLUP WOULD NEVER BE ONE OF THOSE DISGUSTING CREATURES!!!!!!!!!!!!! REMOVE THIS FROM YOUR VIDEO THIS INSTANT!!!!!!!!!! I AM GREATLY OFFENDED!!!!!!!!!
9:45 HELL YEAH I WANT KNIGHT IN MY BODY
i heard that hollow knight guy makes an appearance in some new game silkdong or something?
There's even a shovel knight reference in the first Kleptocats.
I can't believe they made a Hollow Knight reference in Silk Song. The introduction of Hornet was an insane call back to that boss you fight for mothwing cloak.
3:23 if you want to see them interact watch indie cross
HOW DID I NOT NOTICE THAT IVE BEEN PLAYING EDEN FOR SO LONG
if i had a penny for every time there was a show from disney and the makers of the gravity fall that was about girls being lost in fantasy worlds, making friends and saving the world from an evil person and had their third seasons cut short because of disney i would have 2 pennies. which isn't a lot but its weird that it happened twice
The contrasting beginning with the other video lmao
Oh my adhd struck again, I watched a little of this and didn't come back to finish until now.
9:13 that's a "porra mauricio" moment right there.
Did you know that jumping is a reference to jumping from Hollow Knight
so that's twice (that I know of) that a show/news channel has unintentionally used a song from an indie game (ABC used sans. in like 2021)
the block one is so hilarious omg
man, i was thinking about stopping drinking for a while and then you drop a nuke like this? My local shops better being out of this beer upd: i'm late... very very late
tht intro literally made me feel like i was going insane after b2b watching with the easter eggs vid
9:46
Owl House has another one. In s3 Ep 1 we see Luz's desktop and there is an icon for "Holler Knight" that resembles the knight's head
Turma da monica do nada foi foda😂 brazil mentioned🇧🇷🇧🇷
4:35 chat i dont think these are “inspired”
There is another Zelda reference in this show
Indie Cross?
Reporting from 2025: As the title does say "other media" I feel it worth mentioning that King Clawthorne from The Owl House has a Knight plushie in his army. A most worthy addition, indeed.
calling the bible an obscure piece of literature wasnt necessary and was kinda like downplaying a major part of a religion.
bro piplup is from pokemon not digimon
7:09 HIW DID I NOT NOTICE THIS?
The fact that he said obsecure on both among us and the bible means that's they're both the same level of popularity and literature
You can make the hollow knight to fortnite chain much shorter now because the binding of issac itself was added to fortnite
Requiem was kickstarted by how many dollars..?
I enjoyed using pure nail in deadcells
Hollow knight rules the world
BRAZIL MENTIONED!!!!
Turma da Mônica laughs in the face of copyright infringement 😂
6.7 mi11i0n bucks -_-  i cant hear it the same n0w 😭
3:50 so disappointed that you didn't lead that into there being a hollow knight reference in the bible :(
what about   herose of envel on the phone background
9:29 The label literally says "Hollow Knight" lol
Hollow knight in dead cells also has the Nail and the Bench
GIVE ME MY KNGIHT DLC IN SMASH BRUHHHHHHHH, I WANNA POGO IN SMASH *AS KNIGHT*
The creative Director of Warframe has a huge "Hollow Frame" poster on her office wall, with every Frame depicted as a Hollow knight bug.  You can see it on the weekly "Devshort" streams.
7:52 "Annoying ass penguin from Digimon" *proceeds to show us Piplup from Pokemon.
Is this a jojo reference?
TURMA DA MÔNICA MENCIONADA!!!!
you know the hyperfixation is bad when you're looking for references in australian reality tv show the block
KINGDOM HEARTS REFERENCE
Now do Hollow Knight references in Silksong.
9:29 it literely says "hollow knight" (im russian btw)
5:20 THIS WAS WHAT ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES WAS CALLED I couldn't find it anymore 😭
4:55 You can now connect Hollow Knight to Fortnite straight from The Binding of Isaac now that Isaac is in Fortnite.
also indie cross exist, well, not when your creating this vid, but does now
for people that want to unlock the knight skin in dead cells, just pogo off an enemy 10 or 12 times, dummies work
The knight appears in our blood, it’s a disease that makes sickle shaped blood cells
6:06 Adventure Pals mentioned!!!!!!
3:24 Indie Cross or something
THERE’S A HOLLOW KNIGHT REFERENCE IN TBOI?!?
8:00 that got to be Griffith from berserk the bird helmet
DOLLMEN must get a reference too (you fight bugs in glowing environment)
7:53 Guys it's tcnick3!
7:07 I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT WAS A NAIL I CALLED IT
0:07 Fat elon musk?? Huhh?? Are my eyes broken???
5:20 celeste.
And then there was Indie Cross
Yeahhhh turma da mônica mentioned
9:25 Black Knight? LIKE THE ROARING KNIGHT?!? (Yes, I made a Deltarune reference on a Hollow Knight video that came out three years before chapter 3, sue me)
The Block mentioned LESSS GOOOOOOO
Hollow Knight Silksong appeared on main Russian TV channel
what is the seed
9:15 OMG I DONT EXPECTED THIS, BRAZIL MENTIONED !!!  btw the writers of the turma da monica they are a such big nerds... and uptaded with the current generation
4:22 youve gotta be kidding me
6:04 WSU is very proud of Wilton after making this game
I think that the bottom sword on the Amphibia weapon rack is the Dawnbreaker(?) sword from Skyrim. The sword you get from Merida
I would use fridge pins of the knight. The head is magnetic and the black robe/ cape hangd down
This vid got me to download dead cells
Who is here after silksong released?
7:53 this hurt
I have a shirt on that says “Is that a Jojo’s refernce” (yes it has a typo)
Hello I am from the future and  silk song has finally released
SHAW
3:25 OMG You need to watch Indie Cross pleasee it is soooo good
9:15  basically just Gandalf the Grey and Gandalf the White And Monty Python and the Holy Grail's black knight And Benito Mussolini and the Blue Meanie And Cowboy Curtis and Jambi the Genie Robocop, The Terminator, Captain Kirk, and Darth Vader Lo-pan, Superman, every single Power Ranger Bill S. Preston and Theodore Logan Spock, The Rock, Doc Ock, and Hulk Hogan All came out of nowhere lightning fast And they kicked Chuck Norris in his cowboy ass It was the bloodiest battle that the world ever saw With civilians looking on in total awe
SUS SUS SUS SUS
Binding of Isaac was just added to Fortnite, so we can almost directly link Hollow Knight to Fortnite
Deadcells is just such a love letter to indie games.
forager is a great game anyone seeing this should try it
4:55 We can narrow this with Isaac as a Backbling hahaha (Please team cherry, i want the nail as a pickaxe on Fortnite)
Man I wanna crash out so badly rn because I've beaten dead cells true ending on 5 BCS like "Where is your shield" and "WHY FACE FLASK"
AMPHIBIA REFERENCED EARTHBOUND? LMAOO
dude, take an hour of your day and go watch indie cross, it will be worth it
4:56 wait what how TF
7:39 NAUSICA MENTIONED
Brazil mentioned in the end of the video, seeing turma da monica made me explode in laugh haha!
Another good reference/easter egg is the Chains of Harrow quest in Warframe, which is almost like a simplified version of the game with the corrupted Red Veil members being like the Infected bugs in Hollow Knight and Rell/Harrow acting as the Hollow Knight
I cant believe you didn't mention Mike the Knight, he's a brave young hero. 😥9:16
shaw
From all the references you could bring, the comic book series from my childhood was not in my list.
Coming to this on 2025, bro just predicted Indie Cross with the Guacamelee one
owl house mention
Hollow Knight is referenced again in Owl House season 3 on Luz’ laptop, along with a few other games like Stardew Valley and, I believe, Hades.
SHAAA
asian atrioc???
1:49 aww, cute
9:22 is that fucking moon knight
6:22 there's a reference to Hollow Knight in Dredge, another indie banger if you ask me
brazil mentioned 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
my nerd will not allow this you said amphibia and owl house have the same premice as its word for word and king is not a DOG THING hes a titan >:<
I absolutely love cameos and so many people do too, there is a reason “indie cross” is so popular.
the Owl House section can now be posthomously extended, as on Luz's laptop in the third season she has an app titled "Holler Knight" with what looks like the Hollow Knight desktop shortcut
Did you know hollow knight is in hollow knight
theres a hollow knight poster/canvas in neds room in one of the tom holland spidermans, forget which one though
I just want everyone to know in dead cells if you cursed yourself close to 500x you can get two cursed heads and one called beyond damned, one of which is white and matches the vessel garb both combined makes you look like thee hollow knight boss sibling.
In Brasil, there's a paint brand (Suvinil) that has some colors names based on Hollow Knight references: - Ermos Fungicos NCS: 7020-G70Y (Fungal Wastes) - Jardim da Rainha NCS: 7020-B (Queen's Garden)  - Caminho Verde NCS: 7020-G10Y (Greenpath)   The brand explained that a guy who works there (possible from the marketing team?) is a Hollow Knight fan and therefore he named those colors like this.
Turma da Monica mentioned, lets gooo!! Also the green elephant is a character from the same comic book called "Jotalhão"
To everyone who is talking about silk song 3 years ago, it was just released on September 4th, 2025. I am happy to inform you that we all still have at least a sliver of sanity left.
3:44 NO WAY
7:15 xd
3:00 Rand Paul pls go away
As a brazilian, i didn't expect to the see Monica's gang here
DA FUCK YOU MEAN PENGUIN FROM DIGIMON ??!!
dude and i’m a jojo’s fan and the second i heard the word requiem i got a whole neuron activation
3:22 mfs just predicted indie cross' series selling
8:29  u wouldn't know of how much land there is.
4:22  67…
HOW DID I MISS THE REFERENCE IN TOH
“Now we can connect hollow knight to fortnite!” I swear to god if Fortnite does a hollow knight crossover I will kms
5:38 that's me :D
There is also another one, in a puzzle game called "A castel full of cats"  at the very end 🥰
The knight and the nail get all the references, I need a reference to nosk or NKG or absolute radiance or something
4:55 There is actually an Among us backbling in Fortnite making it a little shorter
Mr. knight, I'm assembling a team... 9:16
Wait dead cells isn’t form brawl out?
holy shit, I was NOT expecting to hear mossbag say Turma da Mônica out of nowhere, is that a Brazil reference?? 💚🇧🇷💛
turma da monica tambem????
In Kingdom Rush: vengeance, you can find the head of the knight on a pile of dirt. KR is famous for its references and easter eggs.
“Or on the moon”  *Shows Mars*
3:45 ... It says the bibble
forgot item asylum with a item called the vessel giving you a moveset similer to the vessel
MONICA MENTION
3:26 well indie cross exists now
Another game that has a weapon that lets you play similar to hollow knight?! Say les
6:39 is it just me, or does the island look like Pac-Man?
5:58 Dandara mentioned we brazilian won só mucho 😭😭😭  Edit: 9:20 EVEN TURMA DA MONICA OH MY THATS AMAZING
I have idea if calling Piplup a Digimon was intentional or not.
ALSO IN THE OWL HOUSE There's a reference in season 3, where Luz goes in her laptop, you can see an app called "Owl Knight" or smth with the Knight with a bird beak
8:27 - Yeah, me too... And I'm Australian
3:10 it isn’t mentioned but right before he goes to mentioning the references there’s a cactus that (and this might just be a coincidence) looks like a cactus enemy from Final Fantasy.
One more in dead cells hollow Knight is in the book of legends so as alot of other game characters that you talked about
7:30 on the right of the toast Phantom of the Paradise elite ball knowledge
Ohhh that’s why indie cross has those Characters
the bible has more errors than evidense  if jesus is the father then why did the father sacrifice himself so that he the father can forgive them for something they didn't even do? and he sacrifice himself to forgive them then that isn't mercy that isn't forgiveness the sin has already been payed according to the bible and also to give this milkshake some wipped cream if jesus has been killed on the cross and not go through the hE|| fire he did not save even one human
Calling ninja a fictional character is wild.
SHAW!
I clicked on this video wanting to see someone mention HK in The Owl House. So, cheers! Also, in season 3, there is an app for a game called Holler Knight on Luz's laptop.
Ayo don’t knock my boy Piplup him and the other diamond/pearl  🥷🏽s boutta jump yo shit
shovel knight and ghost have met. INDIE CROSS
8:00 penguin for digimon hurt my soul
you wouldn’t believe this if i told you brotha😔 3:25
crazy way to start the video from the other one this is related to
I'm not sure if the reference was out during the production of this video but another reference made by The Owl house is where in the desktop screen of a device  you can see various game icons like moonfarm valley, Holler knight, and Hades
You forgot about Hornet's most popular line "SHAW!" being mentioned in the title of an underground film from 1994, called "Shawshank Redemption"
TURMA DA MÔNICA MENCIONADOOOOOOOO, VAIIIII BRASSIIIILLLLLLLL+!!!!!!!!!!!
7:04 like the cat person who isn't really a cat but also kinda a cat?
Btw, there is a small cameo in the owl house.
Theirs also Indiecross to (although its not really a easter egg)
7:53 YO. WHY IS PIPLUP CATCHING STRAYS??
6:16 “SHAA!”
Ngl, loved the video but saying that Fall Guys is the best possible match for a Hollow Knight cameo is absolutely braindead, lol.
you should watch Indie Cross
7:52 piplup is not from Digimon😂😂😂
3:24 indie cross moment bruh
indie cross 2 hahahaah
*cough cough Indie cross
7:36 fun fact King was voiced by Alex Hirsch the creator of gravity falls
Imma send a hollow knight plushie to the moon
i like to think this as foreshadow to indie cross 3:30
*SHAW*
7:53 THAT'S NOT A DIGIMON!!!
9:28 [Look at the release date]  This didn’t age very well.
I hear there’s planned to be a few small hollow knight references in this upcoming game Silksong
and now we have indie cross
9:15 brazil mentioned 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
2:59 no way i’m hearing this minutes after i opened a bank account, i literally deposited 1.2k geos 😭
Man, I didn't know that there was a hollow knight refrence in owl house
9:28 - one more thing about it — the writing on this can says "Полый Рыцарь", which is a russian for " Hollow Knight"
3:25 THEY PREDICTED THE FUTURE BRUH
9:21 Is that moon knight in the top
"I like to think The Knight and the Shovel Knight would get along if they met in the real world-"  looks at indie cross  yeah, I think they'd be cool
And now there's indie cross, which isn't really a reference. I just wanted to say indie cross is a cool animated thing and anyone who likes indie games coming together should see it. It's here in YouTube.
9:14 a this point, I just straight up screamed cuz you know, I'm Brazilian and I grew up reading those comics
Little ghost in alot of different games wow
* insert IndieCross reference here *
Amphibia has Jojo bizzare adventure refernze it dosent suprise me
7:03 “AAAAGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” *squeal in pure joy* “a little background on me I didn’t know hollow knight until my teens and I loved amphibia as a kid and I knew the nail existed I just didn’t realize what it was cause I watched amphibia before hollow knight and after I did play hollow knight I had stopped watching amphibia and now that this video is pointing it out I love this fact”
So is this what the knight was doing before coming back to hollownest
the biggest crossover, is probably, indiecross
well, you did miss a reference, in a somewhat obscure game called silksong, you play as a character called Hornet, which is an obvious reference to a boss named Hornet in Hollow Knight
JUST AS AMPHIBIA WAS MENTIONED I GOT A NOTIFICATION FOR SOME RANDOM AMPHIBIA VIDEO
there's a pretty obscure upcoming game called silksong which appears to draw quite a lot of inspiration from hollow knight, if you're a fan of hollow knight you should definitely look into that
I getting flashbacks from indie cross
0:53 so the shovel knight and the knight have been reference in dead cells I see why the creator of indie chose these characters to appear in indie cross
Watch indie cross you'll love it
3:20 Since Indie Cross launched this has aged like wine...
Luz also has "Holler Knight" on her computer.
9:34 did you mean: mace out the windu
3:25 you GOTTA watch Indie Cross
luz from the owl house also just has holler knight installed on her computer
"The penguin from digimon" best part of the video🤣
Was that Waddles the pig next to the Knight in the plushie pile??
Ahh yes "the annoying ass penguin from digimon" my favorite😭
Theres the annoying ass penquin from pokemon
papyrus 7:39
We need a hollow knight tv show
Now we need rainworld
there is an item in "Another Crabs Treasure" called "Rusty Nail" while it looks like an average old nail, the flavour text is what makes it obvious "A sharp, corroded blade more fit for an insect than a crab."
What do you mean “ .5”?
3:30 unrelated, but have you seen Indie Cross?
there's also a set of books, Aster and The Accidental magic, and Aster and The Mixed-Up Magic, that have a grub and one of the enemies from the Forgotten Crossroads in jars.
3 years later dead cells is in Indie Cross episode 2😂
who here after watching Indie Cross
7:52 You’d better be joking about Piplup the POKEMON being annoying AND from Digimon.
There’s a hidden room in a relatively recent metroidvania called Lone Fungus that is one giant Hollow Knight easter egg. There are buildings in the background shaped like the Knight’s head, and the item kept in the room is literally just the Steady Body charm, which does exactly what it does in HK
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ".5" WHAT DO YOU MEAN!!!!!!!!!
7:52 what did the sassy penguin do to you?
Did he just look at a pokemon image and call it Digimon?
3:24 go watch Indie Cross, there you will have your answer!
7:53 DIGIMON?
Somone might have commented this already, but in Another Crab's Treasure the flavor text on the rusty nail references Hollow Knight
indie cross took them 10 mins 3:22 to become kinda like buddies ( until bro became a gold staue)
turma da mônica mencionada
9:31 не надо это ужасная идея
indie cross go brr
I just KNEW TO NOT DEPOSIT MY MONEY IN THE BANK. It was too shady, yaknow? Plus its hallow knight, looks can be deceiving.
I think probably the craziest Quacamele reference is a poster for some female fighters that are referencing Steven Universe
9:30 isnt a small reference, the energy drink is literally spelling out hollow night in russian so you could say it has it own enegry drink
Who's here cause of indie cross? 😅
9:25 УРААА ГОЙДА ГОЙДА РОССИЯ УПОМЯНУТА
7:36  GRIFFITH!!!!!!!!!!!
Calling Piplup "That annoying ass penguin from Digimon"...  You, Me, Denny's Parking Lot.
Hallowknight was created by Big Benches to sell more Benches
Indie cross doesn't disappoint 3:20
man gives old scott the woz vibes frfr
Shovel knight in indie cross :3
The fact a lot of these games and ideas were made into a reality with indie cross is crazy
7:38 YO THERE IS ACTUALLY PAPYRUS TO THE BOTTOM LEFT OF THE SCREEN
7:53 ant no way you called pokemon digimon wrong mon lil bro
9:15 Just so you know: "Turma da Monica" does not believe in copyright infringement.
3:28 they predicted indie cross
eu não esperava o turma da mônica kkkkkkk
This is so relevant no especially with the series indie cross
I know I might be late, but there is a reference in showgun showdown, the shop guy has a hollow knight statue
3:30, and now we have a fun movie with those 2 characters (and even more of them) getting along, nice
Idie Cross is cannon confirmed
3:24 As of the release of Indie Cross 2 you are correct
If you pogo a spike in dead cells with the nail you'll get an achievement
Does indie cross count?
Did you guys know that Shovel Knight was a reference to Shovel Knight from Shovel Knight because Shovel Knight was in Super Smash Bros and because of that he the Shovel Knight appeared in Super Smash Bros.
Brro indie cross..
Does any one agree that piplup is a pokemon not a digimon??😂😂 7:54
4:07 that aint a co-op baby thats buddy in a box aint it?
My 5th grade classroom is Hollow Knight themed. :) The kids love it.
9:12 holy shit!! is that a motherfucking 🅱🆁🅰🆂🅸🅻 reference???
3:24 Well this aged well... (Indie cross)
7:35 Actually there are so... so... SO many referenses for SO many games and shows in this scene alone!!!
Hollow knight being in a house flipper show feels the same way when they used Doom 2016 At doom's gate in an episode of Masterchef-italy
9:28 fuck you mean theres a hk beer?!
3:25 did you watch indie cross?
isnt this a hollow knight cameo video?.... never mind
0:12 The sad thing is, the rick and morty from Space Jam we're killed. 😔
😐      that was ass
7:53 Digimon is wild 💀
as a person whom resides in the place down under, Australia, i have definitely heard of the block but never knew they used hk music
3:24 man... just imaginations of indie cross
Also, there is a small reference in the game “Another Crabs Treasure”, when you pick up the rusty nail stowaway, its description says: “A sharp, corroded blade more fit for an insect than a crab.”
9:13 Turma da Mônica mentioned👏
3:30 he predicted indie cross ep 2
8:02 Metaphor! (I know, Metaphor came later)
4:03 😂
0:58 which third level?
9:13 caralho o que
the golden idol in the binding of Isaac card game is from spelunky if you guys didn't notice
Thats not a digimon, thats a literal pokemon
How do you get the vessel garment in dead cells
i like how he talks about the plushes in king room in owl house and calls the penguin from digimon but then show a pipplup from pokemon
He says he hates on the easter eggs on hk vid
9:42 LIFEBLOOD IS REAL
7:53 HOW DARE YOU DISCRASE PIPPLUP FROM POKEMON! THEY ARE NOT FROM DIGIMON!
7:21 HEY GUYS WE'RE ALL-
7:47 that's the third angel, not the fourth
that Digimon joke and Asia joke caught me off guard.
My favorite is in the Strawberry Jam mod of Celeste, in the Frosted Fragments checkpoint of the intermediate lobby heartside level, there is a secret room with a lore tablet. I can’t remember everything it says but it starts with “higher beings, these words are for you alone”
In Another Crab's Treasure, there's a Stowaway (like a charm thing) called the Rusty Nail, and the flavor text says "A sharp, corroded blade more fit for an insect than a crab.".
i love the annoying pinguin from digimon
ADVENTURE PALS MENTOINED!!!!!
There's also some Hollow Knight references the Baldur song from a spanish studio called "Destripando la Historia" that makes songs about mythology
8:42 WHAT EPISODE
Guys, the Radiance from Hollow Knight is referenced in Hollow Knight's true ending!
Bug Fables and Hollow Knight are both amazing indie games about bugs with great music and funny dialogue.
If I had 10¢ every time Shovel Knight appeared somewhere I'd be rich
NO WAY I WAS GONNA COMMENT THE OWL HOUSE THING!!!! Also, DOG THING!?! Um King is the KING OF DEMONSSSSSSS!!!
9:46 some blood cells already have a reference to hollow knight in how they are white, the color of the knight from hollow knight’s shell
I'm gonna add two more here:   1. During the April Fools event, the Roblox game Phighting! reskinned Shuriken as the knight. Although they sorta butchered it as they named it "The Hollow Knight"which is just wrong.   2. There's this indie animation show called "Indie Cross" and one of the characters is the knight.
The reason why i think the prisionar will steal
There’s no WAY this man just said PIPLUP is from DIGIMON
Bro, how the heck is Ghost in TURMA DA MONICA? KKKKKKKKKKK. Just....what
Alright i want the binding of Issac hollow knight cards those look fucking awsome
One more (new) reference:  In a TD mobile game called "Kingdom rush 5: Alliance", on a level called "The Wildbeast Den", you can see The Knight's mask on a wall with other masks.  And one more (newer) reference:  In the same game, in a recent dlc about spiders, there is a cocoon hanging from the ceiling. If you click it, Hornet's needle will fall out of it. (yes, I know that it's kinda a silksong reference, not a hollow knight one)
4:37 am I the only one who thought it was gonna say, for the second time "this is a reference to a little known literature called 'the bible'"
3 years after vid
they need to stop making games, like seriously theres too many good ones i will never ever get around to them all, we need to ban making games for like 30 years MINIMUM to give me a chance to catch up
My brother was playing Dredge, and he found a subtle Hollow Knight reference in there too. Idk the context--I've never played the game, but something called the "Ruptured Vessel". And if that's not enough, the caption on it says: "Willing host, or sacrificial receptacle?"
ITS SHAW NOT SHAA!!!
Am I just gonna have to watch the two hollow knight cameo over and over
oh yeah, this is a mothafuck brazilian reference😎👏 tchap nelas
Brazil cited (insert anime girl meme)
Top 5 games with "Knight": Hollow Knight Shovel Knight Fort Knight Hollow Knight: Silksong The Binding of Knight
Universe has it's own sense on humour. 3 years ago in this video you said "One more reason to come to Russia". And in several days Russia attacks Ukraine. IMP that's a huge reason to not go to Russia.
beetles are a species of insects that appear in a somewhat obscure reality tv show known as as real life,im pretty sure its a reference to hollow knight
did you know hollow knight features in hit game "Hollow Knight" by Team cherry ?
A thing that you missed was the nail being a weapon in the game “terraria.”
in It Takes Two, there’s a part you see a dock with a metal bench and a lantern - looks like a Hollow Knight reference !
I’m hoping that you were joking about Piplup the Pokémon being a Digimon
The fricken intros on the videos being almost the same is amazing.
The opening just gave me the strangest case of deja vu
Aint no way I just discovered that the knight shows up in turma da Mônica. Wtf?
😮 wait if i have to much knights in my blood cells am i gonna become the knight from hollow knight?
2:09 the desription of the vessel's outfit is this: No mind to think. No will to break. No voice to cry suffering.  this is the text that pups up when you climb out of the abyss, when you are trying to get void heart.
There's a rumored upcoming game called "silksong," and i think the devs confirmed that they're going to sneak a cheeky hollow knight reference in the game.  You should check it out, mossbag!
you forgot to mention that hollow knight is referenced in the very obscure game hollow knight
"Or in our blood cells" 💀
9:16 the Green Elephant is another character in Turma da Mônica that has his own spin-offs in other comics, now I dont know why he is dressed as Gandalf
6:47 i thought amphibia had only evil grunkle stan.....
Bro forgot when shovel knight made it into jsab
Even in village rhapsody knight and hornet had a good time😅 if you tried to watch the vhs
I swear you used the same intro but negatively in a other video
Deepwoken has a lot of hollow knight references...
TURMA DA MONICA CARALHOOOOOO AQUI É BRASIL 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
Bro said digimon and showed a picture of piplup
If I had a nickel for every time a character was named "V", I'd have 3 nickels. Which, y'know, it's not a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice, right?  "V" from Murder Drones "V" from Antimatter Dimensions  "Vi" from Bug Fables ...wait
8:43 nah they were rinnovating houses in Hallownest
There’s a hollow knight reference in my avatar!
9:16 and gandalf the green and gandalf the white, and the main character from the game hollow knight
Or when shovel knight made it into JSaB
heres a more recent one: dredge.  its a fishing game. sometimes the fish are mutated, and the mutated amphipod looks like it was infected by radiance.
at one point i thought you were going to say that there's a hollow knight reference in the bible
0:02 there are 2 side to this story
the plushie thing standing its a mexican youtuber
0:07 fun fact: that’s not only Wario, that’s Elon musk.
The hollow knight music playing in a random television show about flipping houses is some of the funniest stuff I’ve ever seen
team cherry hired chris larkin to do the sound track for hollow knight / silksong. larkin whom lives in aus is freelance musician.not really hard to understand... once again moss always proves just how disconnected his brain is from whats actually hollow knight. which i guess is what makes the legend of mossbags wrongery what it really is. you silly bag of moss
cookie cutter
Shaa 😩
How would the knight get into my blood cells but honestly probably I good way to fight off viruses just gotta get a mini bench
The Block: now in its 20th season.
Australians love to use video game music for their shows, like when they uses the song sans. from Undertale in a Covid report
7:39 do not disrespect king like that
Maaaano, teve até turma da mônica! A razão para muitos brasileiros começarem a ler <3 Great video
i really like how mossbag's intro talking about references and a scene he will remember until the day he dies is itself a reference to his video on easter eggs in hollow knight where he starts it the same way, but talks about a scene he will remember till the day he dies because he hates it.
Honestly I love how microsoft references hollow knight with their pointer cursor design.
7:55 this made me laugh for no reason 😭
Seeing the Binding of Isaac here was awsome, and I think everybody should 100% play the game (not biased at all)
More like, the MID house
what is the beer called?
I'm pretty sure it's not just a practice in Australia; I've heard Sims 3 music used on Disney Jr. and in MandaloreGaming's Empire Earth review, he mentions music from the game being used as stock music on the History Channel.
there is a half life 2 referance in dead cells i think u forgot it
8:39 is that allowed? Do you think they contacted team cherry to use their somber main theme for a metroidvania about a fallen bug kingdom for a tense scene in a reality television show about real people getting houses?
Rip my forager save when I got softlocked behind a chest with no keys
Pokemon* not digimon lil bro 😂😭
I think there is also one from Afterimage. It shows a bench and a lamp, similar to the Dead Cells reference.
The penguin in the Owl House is a Pokemon, not a Digimon. I thought you knew your pokemon lol
I never knew HK was in Forager, I can't wait to equip that
Fun fact: theres another blatant hollowknight reference in the owl house. In one of the final episodes (i forgot) she uses her computer and in the bottom left theres a doodle of the hollowknight icon.
7:17 erm that is the goddess sword
My doctor told me I have sickle cell. Idk what that means but she showed me a picture and it looks I've got a Skong reference in me 😎
I'm a big fan of this indie book called the bible from the author god (?)
im not brazilian so the only other thing i know abot turma da monica is that the game wonder boy 3. the dragon's trap (realy good metroidvenia byetheway) have reskined wersion wich swich some enemies and the main caracter to characters from the show. and since the smoking pig with the eyepach is a dragons trap refrence in cuphed. holownight now have a connection to cuphead.
You missed Haiku the Robot! its another metroidvania like HK
Bro, at least one russian (me) would like to meet you here)) Maybe even buy you that beer?.. If you wish :D
9:29 the can actually says "Hollow Knight" too!
2:51 i hate how this is how i learned i may have gotten scammed
Play the way did you know that the bone weapon is a reference play a game called Skul
"MORTY, I DID IT! I KILLED THE SPACE JAM VERSIONS OF US! THEY DIDNT EVEN FIGHT BACK THEY ACCEPTED DEATH!"
SHAA!
turma da monica mencionada, todo dia uma vitoria diferente
When writing the reasons to go to russia doc we can see a google pfp that may or may not be mossbags face 👀
FORAGER MENTIONED 🗣🗣‼‼
Grime mentioned
It's awesome to learn about these Hollowknight references. I've watched the Amphibia ep. several time and never noticed the swords until now. :D
brazil mentioned
A Turma da Mônica me quebrou 🫠
Is this video a hollow knight reference?
Now that i think of it why is shovel knight referenced in so many games?
7:39 I swear I see tortured Griffith in the bottom right
i love how he expresses his opinion on owl house and amphibia being the same concept
everyone is here was 2 years ago??? woah
6:17 ITS "SHAW" NOT "SHAA" 😭💀
A reference is in The Stars Above mod for Terraria, where one of the craftable weapons is called the "Gossamer Needle", and it's attack is just Hornet's needle throw attack, with a dash ability and her AOE as well. Very fun to see all the references to my favorite game.
where the hell is the 0.5th crossover?
BRAZIL MENTIONED
damn piplup being from digimon is crazy
we all know that under a couch in Australia is where Hollow Knight begins
SHAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!! ADINOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
IVE BEEN IN A LOOP FOR 2 YEARS STOP TELLING ME TO WATCH HOLLOW KNIGHT EASTER EGGS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
it would be nice to see a crossover with Ori, the opposite of hollow knight
The Knight and Hornet were both been put in Smash Ultimate as spirits…
Penguin from digimon ☠️
on the “biding of isaac” part i think mossbag will say “there’s a reference of hollow knight in the holy bible
Most of the Binding of Isaac is very much related to the Bible, bosses, endings, items, characters
Bro forgot hungerknight
I think the largest reference to Hollow Knight has got to be in some game they are making called "Hollow Knight Silksong", I mean they literally put the name in the title they aren't even tryna be subtle
IS that Elon Musk playing Wario?????
8:05 Fun Fact : In the 3rd Season of The Owl House, on Luz's computer in the first episode you're aboe to see a reference to Hollow Knight
this was released after this video, but in a more recent episode of the owl house, thanks to them, there's a scene where the main character is depressed and starts recording in her laptop. and one of the icons is a thing that kinda looks like a fusion of the knight and zote's shells, named holler knight
Bro said "annoying penguin from digimon" then showed a picture of a pokemon💀
Another important reference is in an upcoming game called "Silksong," which features a character named Hornet, who bears a striking resemblance to an NPC in Hollow Knight named Hornet.
7:53 Ain’t no way he did my boy TCNick3 like that bruh 😥
5:04,  hollow friends!
I just noticed this but I believe one of the stuffed animals has Griffiths helmet on so there's a berserk reference right there
i saw mike the knight 9:20
YOOOOOOO BRAZIL REFERNCEEEE
0:00 - 0:29  I see what you did there
One of my favorite little indie games to come out recently called "Outcore" has a SUPER subtle reference that I found hilarious. The entire game is effectively a love-letter to everything that happened on the internet from, like 2010-2020, but one of my favorite moments was when a fuckin boot came out and called himself "Booty the bootleg", in the same style that Flowey did in Undertale. Bed of blue flowers, in a dark room, after a hallway and a fall. After trying to take your credit card info, the damn thing turned into Omega Booty and started attacking you like Omega flowey.  After you beat Omega Booty though, the head grows wings, and just starts floating up into the air, and you have to climb rising platforms while lava rises to attack it, as Booty shoots a laser at you. But the entire thing was a mirror of the Radiance boss fight, which was only made clearer because it came right after the Omega Flowey refference.  Its not often a game makes me laugh like that, so I seriously suggest yall check it out. It does a lot of cool stuff like messing with your computer, but my man Booty just went from Flowey to Radiance without saying a damn word about it, its awesome.
In an nba match they play mantis lords
8:01 GRIFFITH!!!!!!!
7:53 POKEMON!!!*
BRAZIL AND TURMA DA MONICA JUMPSCARE
Yeah I got that weapon 2:07
What biome and dead cells? There are multiple letters of the third. 1:11
I have sat upon the bench in dead cells and gotten the nail 0:51
7:59 : I'm pretty sure the giraffe is a reference to the fact that in the show, Giraffes canonically were banished from the Demon Realm.  Also he called King a dog thing. LMAO.
That reality TV show one was so fucking surreal.
I love the kingdom hearts reference
OMG BRASIL MENTIONED 🟩🟨🟩🟨
In odc 1 sezon 3 in scen when Luz use her laptop we can see icon from hollow knight
the knight is going to appear in your bloodcells after all the hollow knight beer
in the owl house luz computer has a game that look similar to hollow knight
Obviously, I'll never know for sure, but during Elden Ring's Malenia, Blade of Miquella boss fight, she'll do an attack called The Waterfowl Dance where she'll whip her sword around herself in an AOE that's a flurry of white lines.  This attack has always reminded me of Hornet's Needle flurry where the thread whips around her for an AOE. Shaa!
I got here through the references in hollow knight video and am now stuck in an infinite loop
In dead cells, there is a Wall that writes "git gud"
Take a shot every time he says “Knight”
brazilians watching this video getting jumpscared with dandara and turma da mônica mentioned i almost died
Honestly amazed you mentioned The Adventure Pals. Very cool 👍
idk why they didn't make hollow knight have a proportional skin in dead cells considering thatone short night skin
Grounded and one of April fools is ant line mount pointed upward as reference to hall night, because the closest and grounded to the head of the main character that goes unnamed is an ant head It also appears on one of the mountains that specifically find out which itself is a reference to the shining. I think it’s a horror movie. Where is the Bon Jovi from spikes which I can’t tell if it is to meet the soldier video where he’s talking to something else also, I hate that place I don’t want to remember it.
There’s two references to hollow knight in the owl house
Ninja is fictional???
Oh yeah turma da mônica has references to all of the things, they even have a comic that entirely a fnaf reference and is pretty fuking nice (you know, if you anderstand portuguese)
Fall guys would prob make a zote skin
I've been in this loop for 60+ hrs, please mossbag just stop
YOU SAID YOU HATED REFRENCES IN ANOTHER VIDEO
7:37 referencia a feny
King is the last titan in existence in the owl house univers
Bya cora
It’s always nice to see 40 year olds finally notice what we like
7:17 somethin i want to add is the designs i mean look at emperor Belos design(main antagonist) in season 1 and as you can apreciate it´s LITERALLY T.H.E HOLLOW KNIGHT
9:45 Well rejoice! They already have! And they're called "Blood Vessels!" :D
Is that a Hollow Knight reference?
owl house on Lous computer she has a copyright free verso of hollow knight
When I make my game imma have so many references
In the owl house section there’s another reference to Devilman crybaby
IDK if Malenia's Waterfall dance count as one when I saw if for the first time It reminded me of Hornet's annoying attack
Masbag give no fuck about any other show or game pating
FUCK YEAH DEAD CELLS
Dead cells is 😩
09:25 couldnt that be undyne from undertale?
Bro no way owl house had a femto plushie
There is a second Hollow Knight reference in "The Owl House", On the last season with the final episodes, Where Luz opens her computer and there is a game called "Holler Knight", Which has a very similar face.
do you not know what pokemon or yo-kai watch is ???
What is with that grub father card??
3:45 thought he was about to say there's a hollow knight reference in the bible
4:31 inspired
4:31 inspired
wtf I was naively watching a year old hollow knight cameo video to get jumpscared with turma da monica
7:36 Griffith?
8:38 It's like a french tv show about pastry called "Le Meilleur Pâtissier", they use a music from Genshin Impact ("Caelestinum Finale Termini" if I remember well) when its just peoples making cakes, it had tension and suspense 😂 (Idk if my english is ok, if it is, it's nice but if not, sorry to destroy it 😅)
ASIA!!! IM DED
Adventure Pals was a game whose Flash version I used to play as a kid. It's very nice to see that it's Steam version has a Hollow Knight reference
BRAZIL MENTIONED !!!!!! 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🔥🔥🔥
damn kingdom hearts bein part of binding of Isaac is hittin hard
I didn't think the didgimon thing was satire
7:43 is that psycho jenny from  Devilman? O:
1:52 where is it?
This is one of the most obscure but in starlight river they added a summon called the pale knight which is just the knight from hollow knight
Wait i am brazilian and i thinked that you guys didnt know turma da Mônica
I know noone cares, but there was a new Hollow knight reference in The owl House in "Thanks to them". When Luz launches her computer you can see some game with CLEAR resemblence to hollow knight
This isn't a reference, but a popular map in a fairly well known roblox game called flood escape 2 uses the NKG theme. When trying to convince my friend to play hollow knight by playing him some of the music, he said "Hey they copied flood escape 2!"
Я не ров я гора
I just entered for forager lmao
10:52. Why. You know what you did. You must. Right? Please tell me you know what you did.  If you do not...  How? How do you not know???
09:46 Blood vessels
as a brazilian, i actually really enjoyed that he said "Turma da Mônica" instead of "Monica's Gang"
That Russian porter-style craft beer is actually quite nice
GRIFFFFIIITTHHH
In an episode of the Owl House, the main character has a game called “Holler Knight” with a little icon of the knight on her computer
This game got so popular that even God added a reference to hollow knight in real life, if you go a part you will see a BENCH, A literal BENCH, dont know if it saves your game though, probably not
I can't believe you missed the Papyrus reference in The Owl House
Bro i am Brazilian and i didn't know about the tu.a da monica referece what a cool thing to know
Ain't no way there's reference in amphibia and out house
The reason The Owl House and Amphibia have pretty similar premises "at first glance because Owl House starts to divert from Amphibia in its similarity in episode 4 when the horror aspect is fully introduced and the series' unique magic system called glyphs are introduced" is because they are Sister Shows that we're running new episodes at the same time multiple times in their life cycles and their creators know eachother and are really good friends, they are also sister shows with this relatively niche Disney Show called, "Gravity Falls" and once again all three creators know each other and are good friends, and both shows feature call backs to Gravity Falls to the point where it is CONFIRMED Gravity Falls and The Owl House are connected. Sorry just wanted to infodump about my favorite tv shows! ^-^
Theres a game that hasnt come out yet and i dont know if youve heard about it but its main charrectors design is probably a referance to hornet. I think the game is called kill song or something.
Piplup, Digimon? ik this vid is 1 years ago but i guess this is a correction
Let's Farting Now!
I already have knight blood cells 💔
@8:00 GRIIIIIFFIIIIIIIITH!
:)
9:45 i guess you could call it a blood vessel
9:14 Turma da Mônica is the most famous comic in Brazil. They are published for over 50 years. It's the story of a girl and her gang, and there are hundreds of stories with pop culture references. Usually when some big movie or famous series is released they appear in the stories. In 2019 they partnered with DC Comics and released stories with the Justice League.  There is not a single person raised in Brazil who hasn't read a Turma da Mônica story.
Shaa no I prefer baba nada
There's also this small upcoming game called "Slik song" I believe that might have some references to Hollow knight, but I'm not quite sure.
In the grime part of the video I think I saw the pale king below zone and Quirrel to his right
That is so damn funny that an Australian reality TV show was just like "we need sad music" and chose THE HOLLOW KNIGHT THEME SONG LOL
7:53  sir thats a pokemon
BRAZIL MENTIONED🔥🔥🔥🔥
Where’s the thumbnail from?
r/suddenlycaralho
Owl house literally just made the main character have ‘holler knight’ ‘moon drop valley’ and hades on her computer
3:24 ah yes, indie cross my beloved
this is the opposite of the video he made about hollow knight easter eggs
*_OH HELL YEAH, TURMA DA MÔNICA IS FIRE_*
There’s another Hollow Knight reference in Owl House season 3. In the first episode, Thanks to Them, Luz has “Holler Knight” on her desktop.
Oxi, do nada a turma da Mônica?????? 9:13
The owl house season 3 episode 1 has an easter egg on Luz's laptop and its called "Holler knight"
him is already on our deadcells so isn't too far from blood cells
7:38 The snail from adventure time
no es de digimon es de pokemon 7:52
The description of that vest you showed is also an easter egg referencing Pale King's quote on how he wanted to seal away the radiance within a vessel with no voice, no will and no mind or something like that (and based on the events of the game you can tell how well that happened)
The game hollow knight also gets refenced in owl house (i know you mentioned the intro) in season 3 episode 1, when luz opens up her computer you see Holler Knight.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE KNIGHT APPEARS IN TURMA DA MONICA AND I NEVER SAW IT????
I believe that the master of doges charm is a reference to sans from undertale
Griffith from berserk also appears in a stuffy pile
I looked around in a hotel in Las Vegas, and it started playing the city of tears theme.
I beat Dead Cells for the first time with the Vessel’s outfit!
Fun fact: there is a *HUGE* hollow knight reference in silksong due to the main character heavily resembles a character from hollow knight known as hornet
it's piplup from pokemon, not just some random annoying ass penguin (:
It's ramparts not just the third level of the game. The reason from this is that there are actually more level options to be the third level of dead cells
3:23 - 3:30 Moro nighteye made a series called indie cross and at the end the hollow knight and shovel knight meet up as a cliffhanger.
yeah come to brasil we have hollow knight
I can’t believe hollow knight was so popular they made it into a game
I like how the last video you started it with “I hate references” and in this one you said “I love references”.  Also as an amphibia AND an owl house fan, I can confirm that they are animated disney shows about a young girl stumbling into a strange fantasy world, where she must learn to live among bizarre new creatures, and maybe make a few friends along the way.
7:52 digimon? 💀
4:42 amogus
Seeing mossbag express his love for crossovers and then immediately pull a 180° perfectly shows how insane he's gotten while waiting for silksong
HE FORGOT THAT SHOVEL KNIGHT GOT INTO JUST SHAPES AND BEATS RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
9:29 никогда такого не видел:/
Man it would be actually so cool if the knight was in smash bros
Okay i watched like 4 episodes of the owl house before i quit because its cring as hell, but im pretty sure in the lore giraffes are actually in the human world because they were banished from the magic world
They should do the opposite, give us a Hollow Knight tv show with easter eggs for others
also in season 3 episode 1 of the owl house you can see hollow knight on luz's desktop along with stardew valley and hades
9:12 BTW "Turma da Monica" is available in the US and it is called "Monica's Gang" or "Monica and Friends" but not sure if this edition where Hollow Knight appears was released there
what one time he/she said that they hate references but now they like it huh ?
Adidas is even a reference to hollow knight
Piplup will not stand this slander
There's also one from Soul knight.. somewhat The wiki also mentions it One of the quotes she says when you interact with her refers to a friend she met that likes to hum and mine, which the wiki said could be a reference to Myla
You can also find a reference to hollow knight in thae starting area of the game where you go if you die.
mmm Russian hollow knight Beer.
7:17 another Hollow Knight reference in The Owl House shows up in season 3 episode 1 where Luz opens up her computer to record, however if you look at the different apps she has you can see Moonfarm Valley (Stardew Valley), Umovie (Imovie), Hades, a couple others and last but not least Holler Knight
I'm pretty sure that in castle crashers there is a nail weapon that's a reference to hollow knight
there's also "turma da monica" in USA,it's called "monica's gang
You forgot about the knight appearing in hollow knight
9:14 MAURICIO WTF
The name of the green elephant is "J" in the american comic but is "Jotalhão" in the original
I am from brazil and i never noticited that reference
I heard the SHAA! and got flashbacks
You can get a hollow knight shirt in Travis Strikes Again, but the game has a top down view so you can't see it
You forgot to mention the knight’s cameo in a game called “hollow knight” in which he is the main character.
Ele falando Turma da Mônica e muito engraçado 9:14
im brazillian and nearly CHOKED when i saw the turma da monica comic there thats one of the last things that i thought i would see in here
I feel like I just watched a 10 minute ad for games I've never heard of
There is one more thing in Owl house. Luse have Hollow Knight at her PC
Jeeeeeeeez, of course out of any show to do that its gotta be the bloody block
eu vendo o vídeo de um gringo e do nada turma da monica
7:37 I’m not sure but I think the smiling face with red hair is a reference to psycho Jenny from devil man crybaby too
0:38 you forgot that shovel knight made it into rivals of aether
Once Silksong comes out the game is gonna become popular again and there might be more references
Since this video has been released, Spoliers for The Owl House btw, the gang makes it back to the human relm, and on Luz's laptop, we can see a few things: Moonfarm Valley (referencing Stardew Valley), Holler Knight (referencing Hollow Knight), and finally, just Hades.
Aint no way u called piplup a digimon
7:52 DIGIMON?! THIS IS PIPLUP FROM POKEMON GAMES!!! (i hate digimons)
In the owl house there is a group called the emperors coven and their design seems to have som inspiration from the people in god seekers mind
i felt the urge to talk about the knight painting on a murder mystery map from hypixel
...or on the Moon (shows a picture of Mars). Great!
That intro is hilarious
i cliekd on two random moment in the video and head amongus and fornite
THERES A HOLLOW KNIGHT REFERENCE IN OWL HOUSE SEASON 3 ON LUZ'S COMPUTER
I recently noticed we can connect the holy bible to among us
i absolutely love your lowkey humor. just enough to make me exhale out my nose and refresh my attention span for 10 seconds
there should be a hollow knight mod where things are happier. quirrel doesn’t die, millibelle doesn’t run away, etc. there could be some parts that would be hard to change, like the abyss
penguin from ``digimon´´
Ah yes the video paradox, miss bag is sending us back and fourth between the two references videos
3:40 He should have said "an obscure fantasy book", that would be pretty accurate.
The Going to Russia thing didn’t age that well
8:29 Where are we supposed to live if theres no houses? itas not just bugs and dangerous animals down here you know.
8:47 This reminds me when they used "sans." as BGM for a report on COVID
later in the owl house, we get another easter egg about hollow knight, its literally the game on a computer
Quite recently there was another hollow knight easter egg in Season 3, Episode 1 of Owl House. If you looked on Luz's computer, you could see a game called: "Holler Knight"
Fallguys should do a hollow knight crossover, the sizes would work right
griffith is a plushie
Sir that penguin is a Pokémon
0:55 I love that it’s with bugs

Annoying ass penguin form where now (gun coks) I choose your next words carefully
I'm late by a whole year but that same thing with The Block happened with Ori and the Blind Forest. A track was playing in a nature docu-esk video on Netflix but i forgot what the name of it was. It was definitely Artic or icy region related though. It nearly gave me whiplash from how fast i recognized it.  It feels so bizzare that random unrelated shows would want to draw from videogame soundtracks like that. Just outta nowhere.
i thought you hated refences
There's actually a newer reference in the Owl House. We see Luz(main character) using her computer and there are 3 games in her desktop. One of them is called Hades, other one is called Moonfarm Valley and the last game is called "Holler Knight".
"thats one more reason to go to russia" that aged well. im sorry man, we dont get our hollow knight beer after all
Is it just me or does Mossbag sound like Fireborn
"the dog thing known as king"💀
9:16 incrível
You spoiled it. I didn’t get to the Isaac part in the Bible. Also yes, that penguin from digimon is annoying
The Owl House has since added another. At one point in the first episode of the new season, we see Luz's computer desktop which has several shortcuts for video games she's downloaded. One of these is titled "Holler Knight" with a familiar-looking icon.
Theres another easter egg I found! You know our little Hollow Knight is made from The Void? Well it matches the void in heart 😭😭😂
7:53 100% digimon
Fun fact: on 9:27 on a can of beer written: "полый рыцарь" which directly  translates to Hollow knight so its not really a cameo, but the product directly refering the game
How do I get here 5:12
Hollow Knight music also made a cameo several times during the News program of my country. And not only Hollow Knight, music for every media is constantly used in all kind of TV programs, even as intro themes.
Australia does have houses
5:24 what is the music that is playing at this time???
ayo, in the s3e1 of the owl house you see the MC's labtop with some cool games on her desktop you should check it out
Can you make a video about that giraffe thing?
You can also see the knights head in the magic landfill section of shovel knight dig!!
I'm brazilian and I'm in shock seeing that it appeared in the Mônica comics xD
Still waiting for The Knight to show up in Smash…
there is a pretty big reference to the knight in this little indie game called "hollow knight"
Xenoblade 3 Reference
13.5??????? Xenoblade 3 reference!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Turma da monica 🇧🇷 😃
the main character in the owl house also has a parody of hollow knight on her computer called holler knight.. though that episode came out after this video
why you gotta spoil that that hoe steals my money
It also appears in the robot game haiku, the robot. I'll be expecting you to re-make the video so you can add it.
Hello the pet in hollow knight the one that goes boom !!   It is in dead cellss
sir, madam, or what ever you identify as, it is already in are cells
So this is what The Knight did before he came back to Hallownest. OK.
in "Haiku the robot" there is a reference , you can interact with a tomb, on the tomb is written "To those in the distant future, should you find my grave, I ask this: is Silksong out yet?"
Still waiting for the knight in smash bros 🙏
I would love to have hollow knight blood
9:13 BRAZIL MENTIONED LESGO
Soul knight
Carai do nada o turma da Mônica tô brisada
7:53 digimon?
I CAN'T BELIEVE THE OWL HOUSE MADE A HOLLOW KNIGJT REFERENCE!!!!!!!
I can't believe I never noticed the nail in amphibia...or didn't somehow notice the one in owl house...
Theres this game you missed called hollow knight its got lots of connections to hollow knight like the characters or places
Its so bazzare hearing the hollow knight theme inside a reality tv show
Hollow knight is also referenced in the Owl House in the first episode of season three where it’s a game on the main character’s laptop and it’s not so subtly called holler knight
Ver gringo falam turma da Mônica foi o apice do meu dia
4:42 AMONGUS
Lol half of this doesn’t even feel real
There is also an absolutely awsome song called Get Trucked by Olly Steele which includes the knight in the cover art for the song.
Okay hearing Amphibia and The Owl House summarized the exact same way was gold, even though the stories really deviate later on.
The Owl House also has another Hollow Knight reference in Thanks to Them! A game resembling Hollow Knight, titled Holler Knight, is visible on Luz's laptop
You were joking when you said piplup was a Digimon right?
hey my nerd bf said you missed another cameo in bug fables, apparently there is a room with a broken nail in it. also we would both like to kiss you on the lips
Bug Fables <3
Fun fact the Disney show "the owl house" has a reference in season 3 episode 1 on the main characters laptop we can see hollow knight as one of their games (ofc with a letter off for copyright) i found it nice that the show i love is connected to the game i love
yeeeeeeeah rick in space 2 was like really cringe tho  like a lot
I have some problems. King is a demon, the penguin is a pliplup and NOT A DIGIMON. ITS A POKÉMON  (I’m probably gonna get reported for hate)
There are HK easter egg in Tails of Iron. It even gives you set of armor which again reference the HK
Connecting Hollow Knight with...Fortnite I...wasn't prepared for that
in deadcell there is a secret room which have the engravings "git gud" on the wall too. idk if it is an hollow knight reference but it might be.
"Another reason to go to Russia."  I can hear Twitter screeching.
7:52 "there's that annoying ass penguin from Digimon"  *Meanwhile showing that its a Piplup from pokemon:*
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷 BRAZIL MENTIONED 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷  But yeah, Monica's Gang has a lot of  random references like that
someone with short term memory loss will be jumping between two videos here....
Bug fables also has a hidden room where you can see the Knight’s Nail
I love the duality of these two videos! Also, as a Brazilian it was nice to see 2 references from Brazil (Dandara and Turma da Mônica)
Australia has used sans. for the news so of course we’re going to use hollow knight music for the block
love the fact u used antibirth music for the binding of isaac
There's also a reference to Psycho Jenny from devilman in the owl house intro
5.7k dislikes. Really?
I didin't really care about this video up until 7:52 and I am very angry -and will send  a pipebomb to your mailbox-
9:10 HOLY SHIT IS THAT A BRAZIL MENTION?????????
based shovel and hollow knights
Guys help I still haven’t found a way out of the loop he just recommends the video on screen and sounds so convincing
The way you described owl house and amphibia, I can’t
As a Brazilian I never ever thoght of expecting seen Turma da Monica been quoted in a Hollow Knight video
NAH NOT THE FACT THAT HE CALLED A POKÉMON A DIGIMON 💀💀💀
Another reference to Hollow Knight from TOH is on Luz's laptop, you can see Hollow Knight on her desktop. (In S3 E1)
I should really finish Hollow Knight...
“Might also be in our blood cells” *THE VESSEL HAS ENTERED THE VESSEL*
I love Moss’s consistent take on how much he loves references
Material implication is cheating. Giving that outside syntactical reference, the semantics of it leads to issues of generating paradoxes.  Therefore you cannot willfully say that Hollow knight implies Fortnights, through connection.   And yes, this is a high brow logic joke
I was not expecting an appearance of Brazillian children's slice of life/bizarre adventure comic Turma da Mônica. Your pronunciation of it is also almost on point, which impresses me. We tend to play fast and loose with copyright here.
The Owl Have House, as of its most recent episode "thanks to them" has another reference. Luz has "Holler Knight" installed on her laptop.
6:53 I snorted. Loud.
This happened after you made the video but in the season 3 episode 1 of the owl house called “thanks to them” we see another reference to hollow knight. When Luz opens her laptop we can see she has it on her computer. However they call it Holler Knight probably cuz of copyright issues
Owl house, anfibia seam thing 👌😂
3:25 i don't think they would get along because the shovel knight just wont notice the bug smaller than regular bug enemy
As someone who plays a lot of dead cells, the pure nail is a really interesting weapons, less for the upwards and downwards attacks, and more for the fact that it's the only melee weapon that allows you to move while attacking
Owl House took the Hollow Knight reference even further with the character of a Hunter, who is one of many clones created by the royal monarch who takes a paternal role to them, yet ultimately drops the failed clones into a subterranean chasm that’s littered with their skeletal remains.
When knight said "im hollow" i cried
It shows up TWICE in owl house its also a game on Luz's laptop but called "holler knight" along with the knights face
BRAZILLL
Owl house made even more references.  In season 3 as we are looking at the Luz's monitor we can see 3 indie games. Holler knight, Hades and Moondew valley.
In the new episode of the owl house there is a not so subtle reference to hollow knight
7:17 Theres actually another hollow knight reference in the owl house, in season 3 episode 1 Luz is on her computer desktop and there’s stuff like: Holler knight - which has a picture of the knight Moonfarm valley - reference to stardew valley Hades - probably a reference to hades idk i havent played it
I love hollow knight cameos and cool video man :]
LoL, Turma da Monica is very good, they always made a lot of good references
Umm actually the giraffe in the owl house is a reference to Cade mc.cown a member of friends without benefits.
in the newest episode of the owl house, when luz opens her computer you can see an app called "Holler knight" with the knight's face above it
The thing is the people who who made hallow night also made all those other indie games and I love all the other references they put in dead cells
like, in the series with the knight doll, that guy was dressed with the knight color sceam and i was sure that white head red dress flying threw the air lady was hornet for a sec
Wait so your saying that my favorite video game is referenced in two of my favorite tv shows.  Awesome
In the 18th episode of the TV series "Heroes of Envell" At the very beginning there is a gorgeous reference to the knight
"theres that annoying ass penguin from digimon"
As an update to the hollow knight reference in the owl house, in the episode “thanks to them” we see the main characters computer desktop, which includes an icon for the game “Holler Knight”
9:47 you my good sir had created a paradox
Fun fact: the owl house has a very blatant reference to hollow knight in the season 3 ep 1 where Liz’s computer has hollow knight
6:35 7:17   I see what you did there classic mossbag
Terraria and Deadcells have collabed
8:03 can't believe you missed the reference to Griffith
No, bug fable isn't a spiritual successor.  It killed paper mario, and is wearing its skin.  That being said, I don't disapproved, since the likelihood of us getting a REAL paper mario game is about the same likelihood as me running into someone on the street who will give me ten million dollars just so I can talk his ear off about my book.
The one about the block reminds me of how I hear botw and acnh music on the local radio station from time to time
I'm surprised how many games I play that have hollow knight references. I haven't even played hollow knight yet but I have to, now, to understand all the references...
7:53 that penguin is from pokemon. not digimon you dork.
Or when Shovel Knight made it into Just Shapes And Beats
in deadcells in the book at the beginning they also reference hk
"Penguin from digimon" bro
I think the vessel skin in Dead Cells could've had the legs thinned out or something to match the hollow knight better.
This intro seems familiar I just can't put my finger on it
It Pokémon 7:54
I actually cannot believe Hollow Knight reference is in owl house, totally the moment of all time
Two things: one,In season three of the owl house there is an app on Luz’s computer that has a picture of the knight on it. Second, PIPLUP IS FROM POKÉMON, NOT DIGIMON. BRUH.
the annoying ass penguin is from pokemon!!!!
eu não tava esperando uma referencia de hollow knight na turma da monica
Funny and educational? Best hollow knight video 10/10
Mossbag mentioning Bug Fables has to be one of the greatest things on all time.
Oh Yeah He Was Fun
At the end mossbag casually breaks the 4th wall
9:13 im brazilian, and i say that i din't expect that coming
since the episode aired after the making of the vid, I thought I'd add another Hollow Knight reference for the Owl House here.  during episode 1 of season 3, on Luz's computer you see two games, Hades a reference to Hades and Holler knight to reference Hollow knight
hollow knight reference?
9:19 the name of the green elephant is Jotalhão👍
Me when tboi 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮🎉😮🎉🎉😮🎉😮😮🎉😮😮😮🙂🙃🙂🙃🙂🙃🙂🥲😆🥲😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😁😁😆😆😁😆😆😆😁😆😁😆
9:14 Ok WTF turma da monica?! You r telling me that my favorite game made an appearance on my childhood comic?! Can’t predict shit in Brazil Just this detail deserves a like
There’s also a skin of the Knight in a game called Nova Lands.
9:14 BRO XD I AM FROM BEAZIL AND I LOVE HOW YOU SAY TURMA DA MÔNICA XD Btw good video
Penguin from Digimon... oh hush up. Pokemon sucks
I actually live in Brazil and Turma da Mônica was part of my childhood but i didn't know about that reference (probably because i didn't have that many comics of Turma da Mônica and mostly just watched the TV shows)
THERE IS 64,920 LIKES, WHAT THE POTATO
Полое пиво.
Hollow Knight also made a cameo in a game called Dragonfable in which it had a thematic bug quest and you can get both the pure nail and hornet’s needle.  There is also a mask
Or when shovel knight got into for honor and brawlhalla
That’s not a Game Gear and you know it
youre "obscure" jokes were fucking hilarious, gladly subbed now
9:25 this didn't age so well.
are we not gonna talk about how at 7:36 theres a griffith stuffed animal playing a piano
I just saw the new hollow knight reference in that one new owl house episode.
I'd cancel your trip to russia if I were you...
Hollow Knight Silksong actually features  Hornet who is a character from Hollow Knight
Luz from Owl House also has Hollow Knight on her laptop :)
Annoying penguin from...digimon?
Whats shovel knight doing in my blood? I thought i was a pure hollow knight fan
Monica's Gang (Turma da Mônica) is a comic book that has been around for decades in Brazil. A children's series (despite having a spin off series of teenage characters) with humor, which always makes reference to other series, movies, books... Practically everything from pop culture appears here. I remember when I was a kid and I loved when "pokemao" appeared. It was never as good as the real pokemon, but I laughed a lot.
I know there is a sans the skeleton in the tv show Bluey, not relavent to hallow knight but ya
The golden idol card is actually a reference to spelunky, I an confirm this because I have played both spelunky games and the idol in the cards picture is identical to the golden idol from the spelunky games
excuse me digimon?! hello !? 7:50
would not recommend going to russia
5:11 What the heck is this? I've done so much in Hollow Knight and have never seen this
Essa é uma mensagem a todos os brasileiros que veram este vídeo:oxi Maurício coloco o vessel no meio da turma da Mônica?kkkkkkk
Полый рыцарь на банке с пивом😂
i watched this and the sister video back to back and i almost shit myself
The Adventure Pals is such a stupid game and I love it
The Owl House just had its Season 3 premiere (it's on YouTube), and it includes another Hollow Knight reference on Luz's laptop/desktop!
owl house has another HK easter egg in a recently released episode where we see Luz's laptop, she has several games such as 'hades', 'moondew valley' (i think) and 'hallow knight' LOL
what game is at 0:26? i am interested in it.
I just realized that you can also see the Great King Papyrus at 7:39 I know it has nothing to do with Hollow Knight but I just saw Papyrus and got happy (hes in the bottom left)
I take it Mossbag isn't too fond of The Owl House
7:53 Hol up, did he say Digimon?!
One cameo you missed was that Hollow Knight made it into this game called Hollow Knight
I’m gonna put orange juice in my bloodstream as a hollow knight reference
6:52 I thought that's... a Game Boy The game slot is a little off but I have one and it most resembles a GB
7:17 actually owl house actually now has a 2nd hollow knight cameo. In the season 3 trailer it had the main character recording herself in a online diary, and on the desktop u could see a window that said "Holler Knight"
My mom asking why i keep eating tiny black cloaks
I love how Dead Cells is made in such a way it looks like a stand up comedian going on stage to tell everyone who his favourite artists are, while still delivering a very good show of his own. It kinda feels like a very good friend who always introduces you to people you will like
Wait, wait ,wait, millibelle is gonna steal my money?!
Oh wow, thats actually a lot of references^^
I wonder what this key does, it definitely doesnt open any doors :- >:O
Wait what about the reference in ori and the blind forest
shovel knight also got into brawlhalla
I love this thumbnail so much for some reason
theres a reference to hollow knight in a pretty well known video game called "Hollow Knight" how did you miss that
you know you're a hollow knight sweat when you find the reference at the word "bank"
6:00, I’m waiting for Silksong and now a sequel / prequel for Dandara.
Bro, you just talked about Turma da Mônica, but I love u now
"all knights can weild nails, but no bug can weild a shovel" -Shovel knight, pvz2 shovel zombie, BFGiant
0:58 "can be found in the 3rd level of the game" which one 💀
Bird? Digimon I think it's piplup and pokemon
I actually thought that turma da Monica was a Portuguese cartoon (my home country).
Dragonfable best reference fight me.  Though Forager and Fist was pretty good too ngl
I cant get over the thumbnail, it look so cute that the character are just holding the knight while the knight looks at him.
I like how indie developers give each other a shout out in their games.
Is the LOATHESOME DUNG EATER from Elden Ring a reference to Dung Defender (Ogrim)?
oh hell naw they done put the 4th angel in a kids show
Tiny Thief . In the Castle  . Привет из России:3
why isn't there a cameo of the winged sentry? *RUBARRR!!* in media? 😂😂 on a serious note i'm currently playing bloodstained and the obvious cameo appearance of shovel knight, his armour and his weapon were all present in the game which was surprising, do bloodstained devs have any link to shovel knight or was this just a heads up to the game? 🤔
Missed opportunity: When talking about The Binding Of Isaac, you had the perfect chance to make a joke about there being a Hollow Knight reference in the bible
HOLLOW KNIGHT IN TURMA DA MONICA??????? WTF AKDKAKDKAKDKKAJDJALRKAKKRKAKDKKS MANO EU TO MT EM CHOQUE
My favorite fictional characters include Jake The Dog, Ninja from Fortnite, Bugs Bunny…
You missed one
AMOGUS
TEM HOLLOW KNIGHT NA TUMA DA MONICA DSAJLDKSAJLDJLSAKDSA
Hearing a american guy say "Turma da Mônica" is fucking funny.
Its so weird when past people talk about Russia
bro why u start talking  about fall  guys skins in a hollow knight  cameos video?
9:30 beer litterally translated as "hollow knight"
Will you make the 0.5 reference in your game to make it an even 14?
" . . . Annoying a** penguin from Digimon" I almost died of laughter. Good joke.
I saw the pure vessel in where’s Waldo please help I might be going crazy
*Dude* Griffith's fucking HELMET was among the stuffed animals... Like- Griffith- from Berserk. 8:00 in exactly, before he shows the egg painting and covers it- pause.
At 7:48 there’s Psycho Jenny from Devilman Crybaby
7:54 is a Piplup poke'mon.
We need a hollow knight show
"Another fictional character that appears in fall guys is Ninja" fucking killed me
Até na Turma da Monica, quem diria kk
AAA games: We don't like cross overs because we'll lose sales.  Indie games: Ey yo, you want my character in your game  Indie games: Aight.
3:09 there was a scott cofin statue
nine minutes. thirty seven seconds. top left of the screen, golden portrait. IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE?
Great 👍🏻
whats the game in 0:24
There’s that annoying ass penguin from digimon 💀
Fund fact hollow knight has no reference to hollow knight
6:53 thats a gameboy by nintendo
We should check if the Bible has any references to hollow knight
8:00 theres also a reference to berserk more specifically to griffith
7:03 Is that Dawnbreaker from Skyrim on the bottom rack?
In the obscure piece of media "Hollow Knight" the knight from Hollow Knight also makes an appearance along with several other characters, like the midwife and Myla.
The Russian craft beer is literally called "the hollow knight" lmao
eita, meteu um turma da mônica legal
Well, hollow knight appears on this craft bear because it's called "Полый Рыцарь", wich literally translates to hollow knight :/
4:35 i might have yo get this card game now 8:08 famm, Disney really likes to reference things
Hollow Knight is most certainly not the most popular game, and I don't even think there was a year where it became the most popular game, but it has way more references than the more popular games. It is still high in the popularity list, but there are certainly more popular games, so it's incredibly strange that Hollow Knight has more references than most other games.
"I didn't even know there were over 800 houses in australia"   mate, we have over 25.69 million people in Australia, where do you think we all live lmao
Turma da Monica e hollow knight o melhor crossover.
does a roblox jojo game adding hornet and the knight count as a cameo
O Maurício de Souza é fã de Hollow Knight ??????
The knight also apears in hollow knight
Finding the nail in dead cells I was so happy (I like the weapon :3)
lmao not sure if he saw this but the golden idol card from binding of isaac card game is another reference from spelunky 2
yes hollow knight invented needles
7:48 thought they were call ohm
9:30 DON'T GO TO RUSSIA IT'S FUCKING HELL HERE
1:36 "addicting". The word you're looking for is Addictive.
Turma da monica💀💀💀💀
What abound brawlhalla? They have the same attacks as the same buttons/keys
What, in the other video he said he hated references 😂
I would like to see a hollow knight show
here's a pretty obscure reference i found in the upcoming game "silksong": the main character actually bears a striking resemblance to hornet from hollow knight!
Minor spoilers for TOH   Hollow knight actually appears a few other times in The Owl House. One episode when they go to a carnival, there’s a building that has a face that looks very similar to the Dung Defender. One episode in season 2 is called “Hollow Mind” and In that episode one of the characters wears a mask that looks identical to The Knight’s mask. And the main antagonist Emperor Belos shares a small resemblance to Pale King.
9:17 Hollow Knight já apareceu em Turma da Monica 😳, que surpresa adorei
Oh, shovel knight also made it into just shapes and beats, just not the actual knight. Banger songs tho
The "Broken Nail" Relic from Revita.
7:02 ayo pink guy is holding Monsoon's weapons
7:51 moss bag I’m not sure if you did this by accident or on purpose but I want to point it out: piplup is from Pokémon, not digemon
Also, among the plushies, you can find Griffith from Berserk(he is sitting with piano) Aaand, maybe here's plushie of snail, which is pretty similar to Lich snail from Adventure time P.S: next to fourth angel can be pink bear from Fortnite (i don't know his name)
The Nail from Hollow Knight can also be found in Bug Fables within a cave.
There is a kings brand on the shirt of the elder mark in the Craig of the creek  theme song
Ninja is now a fictional character finally
8:05 I’m pretty sure Griffith is referenced in this shot also judging by the guy with helmet
7:43 theres also Psycho Jenny from Devilman: Crybaby
Eu realmente não esperava ver turma da Monica aqui
The best candidate for a Hollowknight crossover is Brawlhalla
you forgot about the 'mallow knight' beer
"I hate references"  -Hollow Knight Easter Eggs  "I love references"  -This video
COMO ASSIM APARECEU NA TURMA DA MÔNICA???
I realized that in one episode of owl house idk what his name is but this little guy gets this mech suite from the emperors coven I think? Sorry I haven't watched the show in awhile lol. But a little guy. Going in a mech suit. Hmmm I wonder what reference the [[big shot]] show is doing..🤔
Wait the introduction part seem familiar. I wonder why.
Ngl that penguin from digimon looks like the penguin from Pokemon
Moon Knight was in that comic frame
1:54 interacting with the bench also heals you
nobodies gonna talk about him calling piplup a digimon?
Just yesterday İ find an bench in dead cells and could tell it was the bench from hollow knight and even got the pure nail from it i just pogoed stuff rest of the game until i die
HOLY FUCK, I WANTED TO HAVE SEEN THAT TURMA DA MONICA COMIC SOONER (or i have already seen it when younger and haven't paid attention and didn't get the references) THAT IS SO COOL
The penguin from digimon?! It’s fucking Pokémon!!
I have bin stuck in an infinite loop of watching this video and references in hollow knight since this dropped
The ending to Ron's Gone Wrong is very similar to the ending of Hollow Knight, but I think its more of a coincidence than a reference Basically, Ron goes back to his place of origin, the bubble headquarters, and has a realization about the world he is in before ultimately sacrificing himself for everybody else by uploading his code to all the other B-Bots. The interesting part about this is that while uploading his code to the database, his white design gets flushed and he turns completely black, which looks uncanny to the voidheart charm
7:53 Digimon? Its Piplup, form Pokémon
You see this video is actually a sneaky reference to the website YouTube
Did you now that benches can be found in real life too! Some locations I recommend: Park
4:54 hollow knight connected to fortnite (real)
The knight features in a very small game called "minecraft" as you can build many things one of which is the knight from "hollow knight"
4:38 I CAN'T ESCAPE IT I CAN'T ESCAPE IT I CAN'T ESCAPE IT I CAN'T ESCAPE IT I CAN'T ESCAPE IT  GET OUT OF MY HEAD, THIS WORLD; YOUR CREATION WAS CURSED. YOUR EXISTANCE WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE. YET YOU STILL HAUNT US. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
I love how the Amphibia and Owl House descriptions you gave are exactly the same.
4:54 also fall guys is now owned by epic games, who also owns Fortnite. Another may to connect Hollow Knight to Fortnite.
As an Australian, I can confirm that the block is actually filmed in the only city here with only 400 houses, they simply destroy the houses and rebuild them each season.
( Brazilian comics series "turma da molnica" ) Parabéns gringos vocês falam 99% ingles e do nada turma da monica, perfeito
Hollow Knight is a soulslike metroidvania, meaning it’s a soulsborne reference, meaning it’s a Berserk reference… wait
An unknown peice of literature, THE BIBLE
4:39 WHEN THE IMPOSTER IS SUS AMOGUS
boys i found a demo for a game features a boss from hollow knight The Hornet its in the game hollow knight silksong
I got a reference that didn't got through and I see why the warden in Minecraft his second last design his head looked like the knights I think they thought of adding that reference because in waden in a acinet citys deep underground unfortunately that warden was not added and the knight reference was not included
I actually hope the knight gets a skin in fall guys
Morbius has a reference to Hollow Knight, trust me, I watched it and it's a good movie, its there.
The moment when shovel knight made it into shovel knight was absolute epic
Well the crewmate from among us is now on Fortnite so the table became more shorter LoL
I remember getting a legendary quality pure nail with plus 300% attack damage but plus 300% damage taken and having no idea what the reference was. But it was amazing.
Shin the best Disney show in recent years Owl house
The day they add Hollow Knight to Skul:The Hero Slayer, I will go crazy-
AAAHH I'M STILL PLAYING EARLY STAGES OF HOLLOW KNIGHT I HAVE OVER 1000 GEO IN THE BANK ACCOUNT I KNEW MILLIBELLE IS SHADY THANK GOD I FOUND OUT BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
Anyone else see the devilman crybaby plushie
I love how you brought to light a whole bunch of fun, obscure indie games~
When you zoomed on Ohmu on that Owl House screenshot, also noticed there is a Devilman Crybaby character there just above Ohmu, Psycho Jenny, that big head with arms and legs
7:52 Digimon? LOL
7:53 D-Digimon?
Me watching this as i get my butt kicked by a grimmkin novice after starting the grimm troupe then getting my butt kicked by myla: mmhmmmmmmmmm
Pokémon… not Digimon
Ummm didn’t you say you hated references?
i think in isaac, the shade item is another reference to hk
Fun (or not so fun) fact about the Binding of Isaac: Four Souls Hollow Knight cameo, all those cards featuring characters from different games and IPs cannot be found in the official commercial release, but are instead exclusive to those who backed the expansion on Kickstarter.
7:53 Umm new digimon character here for the digimon ghost game series, behold, Penguinmon!
7:40 I think I can also see Grifith from Beserk, with the helmet.
What the
Dude called piplup a Digimon 😂
7:40 I was waiting for you to mention Griffith's mask here. I kinda really want to watch Owl House now.
The proportions argument for the skin isn't really valid tho when you look at the skull skin. That skin looks so weird tho
4:50 The fictional character know as ninja got so popular they made it into a streamer in real life!
9:30 that aged like milk
9:31 That didn't age well
4:42
Mirabelle steals ur geo... I gave her 1.5k and she ain't steal it
Spider-Man is also in Fortnite guess who’s in Spider-Man’s universe, that’s right, it’s morbius. Hollow knight is connected to morbius
I just beat HK for the first time and loved it! Came across your channel and love all the HK lore and such. Instant sub. Keep it up dude
9:12 NO FREAKING WAY 😭😭😭😭
Damn, I must be old. But no, that wasn’t a game gear, it was a game boy pocket. Them thick bios that needed  4 batteries
9:46 he is in my eyes he is in my ears
9:08 falou do Brazil me senti na obrigação de comentar em português  Nice video
In the owl house in that same frame there is a reference to berserk to
Shovel Knight and The Knight have made so many appearances together I want them to have a game together.
7:53 pipplum? Or something like that ? Wasn't it a Pokémon?
you forgot the time when Shovel Knight made it into Just Shapes and Beats
would also argue that the basement part of the palace shown in the season 2 finale (king's tide) with all the masks would be a very roundabout reference in hollow knight. but otherwise i was pretty surprised (and happy) to see owl house in this, lmao.
at 9:22 you can also see moon knight
BR
Brasil is referenced = you have my like
"there is that annoying ass penguin from digimon"  Pokemon fans : *facepalms*
In forager there's a hollow knight mask cosmetic
But mossbag you forgot the grimace reference
Help I've been stuck in a loop for 5 hours, each time I finish this video I have to watch the other media Easter eggs in hollow knight and then it takes me back here, is this my life now?
I remember that episode on the block! My mum watches it all the time. I was sitting in my room when suddenly I heard the hollow knight theme from the living room. I went out and was surprised to see the theme playing on the block
There's possibly another Hollow Knight reference in Bug Fables. Upon entering a secret area in a cave, you can find a cracked sword that resembles the Knight's nail.
You can't bring up shovel knight without bringing up the game grumps portraits
GIT GUD! Is everywhere.
Mfw I got a bank ad right after the bank joke
9:30 oh nooo this joke kinda bad now lul
9:28 that didn’t age well
SHAW
You did not spot Femto in there? 7:42   Someone needs to check out Berserk.
"Poliy Ritcar" - "Полый Рыцарь" is written on the beer. It literally translates to "Hollow Knight"
In the owl house plushy scene, the plush directly above the ohmu is pretty clearly psycho jenny from devilman crybaby
9:28 lol 2022 hindsight
as a brazilian, i can say that this comic LOVES to reference other stuff, first time seeing hollow knight tho
But wait doesn't the guacamelee reference not also remind one of the zote statue 🤔
An even better question is why has Markiplier not played this popular of a game yet
The comedy is so dry I can’t tell if he genuinely hates half the things he mentions, or if the delivery is that good.
9:16 hi people, brazilian here to explain the story behind this cameo here. so, turma da mônica (translates to mônica's gang btw) is probably the most famous brazillian comic series ever. yeah, it's meant for kids, but the wrtiting is usually very clever and it can be enjoyed by everyone, really.  this particular photo seems to come from  "clássicos do cinema", a comic series in which mônica's gang characters star in parodies of many movies. the one in the photo is Lord of the Rings, which is why there is an elephant gandalf there. he's actually Jotalhão (translates to Big J), and he's playing the part of gandalf in that comic.   they've done parodies of EVERYTHING, from Star Wars, to the MCU, to Jurassic Park, the list goes on. and usually, they have one page in which the artists can go crazy and bring in characters and people from everywhere: that right there is one of them, and it's always so cool to see eho they put in there
9:11 BRAZIL MENTIONED 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Brazilian guy here. Your pronunciation of "Turma da Mônica" was on spot! Did you practiced?
the "Annoying ass penguin from digimon" Is from pokemon. Piplup.
Please make it stop I've been watching the two Hollow Knight reference videos for months now :(
Lost interest in the video right after you said that Rick and Morty cameoing in Spacejam was cool.
4:40 shoulda said the Bible again
Turma da monica got me good
9:25 I live in Russia and have never seen it in the store 🤔 And it's even called "Hollow Knight," what arrogance.
Mallow Knight beer moment
That Russian beer is actually called "Hollow Knight", just a bit adapted and called "Полый Рыцарь", even the whole design of the can is inspired by the game.
3:15 can some one make a reference to this refinance in re...
The cuban news used four Hollow Knight themes (False Knight, Hornet, Dream Battle and Greenpath). That's really weird, I know.
ALA TEM TURMA DA MÔNICA NO VÍDEO KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK  BRAZIL
7:34 how dare you insult piplup (piplup is a Pokémon not a digimon I know it was a joke but I’m just informing people who don’t know)
4:53 Ooooooh that hurt
9:13 its a referência?!
there are also a few other hollow knight references throughout bug fables! if i'm remembering correctly there's a nail somewhere, and there might have been a reference to the fountain in the ancient basin?
as a brazilian i didnt expect turma da monica
Majora’s Mask has many creatures baring masks. Perhaps it’s a reference to the dreamers?
Fuck me the witt in your writing is awesome mate.
In the plushies it has a reference to devil man crybaby
How connect hollow knight to batman- Hollow Knight-Binding of Isaac TCG-Crewmate-Amongous-Fall Guys-Ninja-Fortnite-Batman You're welcome
also Shovel Knight from Bloodstained : Ritual of Night
9:30 aged like milk
Turma da Mônica gives absolute 0 shits about copyright
oh damn, dung defender theme slaps.
you know when ppl call Pokemon digimon THAT REALY PISSES ME OFF
4:50 no
i almost missed multiple times he made stupid or obvious references like 'shovel knight in shovel knight' because he spoke about it in such a way. edit: or i just dont know how the channel works bec the entire comment section is the same way.
5:38 "....both the Knight and Zote" ACTUALLY I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT'S THE INVINCIBLE FEARLESS SENSUAL MYSTERIOUS ENCHANTING VIGOROUS DILIGENT OVERWHELMING GORGEOUS PASSIONATE TERRIFYING BEAUTIFUL POWERFUL GREY PRINCE ZOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
XD
there’s actually a pretty small game that does make a hollow knight reference called “blood will be spilled” that had the knight sitting in a saloon, i recommend playing this game it’s pretty good, though it does have some bugs litterally and figuratively.
Cool vid
definitivamente eu não esperava ver turma da mônica aqui, porém adorei
Hollow has become one of my favourite despite how hard some parts are but It is also a great game
Ooohhhhh the brokenness vessel the amount of times he killed btu when I finally killed his dream virson it was very easy because I had become so powerful since first time and it was actually peace full after because its like his soul was set free
When i found the pure nail playing 10 minutes of dead cells, i lost my shit.
Bug Fables actually has two Hollow Knight references. In a secret room of a secret cave where you fight the Mother Chomper boss, there’s an Old Nail in a stone.
9:31 well that didn't age well
жду русских субтитров так же, как и силксонг
TURMA DA MONICA TEM HOLLOW KNIGHT AI SIM CARALHO
Your love for references explained in the introduction would make Captain America proud
HE DID IT GUYS HE TALKED ABOUT THE TURMA DA MÔNICA EASTER EGG (brazilian here was just exited)
well that russian joke aged poorly
i cant tell if this is real or not anymore ;-;
what about soul knight
6:36 i think it also references pac-man due to its island shape
links refrences wrong in a refrence video. lol
I do know this one upcoming game that references hollow knight, it is called Silksong, and we do not know when it will release but the main character resembles hornet
Man, I decided to follow you when you talked about “turma da monica”, I’m Brazilian; and I love hollow knight and the owl house too; but turma da monica is too much for me
I'm kinda insulted that you only showed off the ONE bug fable cameo.  There are in fact two.  There is a statue of the lost night in the game in a semi hiden room.
Another indie game that collabed with dead cells is "Soul Knight" it's pretty good, but they haven't collabed with hollow knight yet
9:21 you're just gonna walk past my main man Moon Knight
Which digimon character do you like more? That annoying electric thingy that is yellow, or that brown furry that has too many transformations?
turma demônica
Dumbass called piplup from Pokémon a Digimon
the way he says "a rather obscure _____ known as _____" makes me think of Lemony Snicket saying "a word which here means"
Everywhere I go I see him....
7:53 Digimon? DIGIMON?!
Yeah, there's...so many reasons to go to Russia-
7:38 Another character being referenced in the plushie pile I think is the Character Griffith from Berserk, the plushie that is in the right to king  wherein the grey mask is referencing Griffith’s helmet. It can also be a reference to a movie called Phantom of Paradise, the main character wears a helmet? Mask? that looks like that.
the fact i watch both amphibia and owl house and i knew about both of the references just proves that i don't have anything better to do with my life
The penguin from digimon….
I still say to this day that the Dung Eater from Elden Rings is inspired by our beloved Dung Defender.
TSA: No More Heroes  Hollow Knight Shirt
the penguin is from pokemon and its name is piplup, its not form digimon
your right about that scale body thing. the hollow knight in the game is like 3 feet tall, so the cloak outfit in dead cells wouldn't come to scale to the main character of dead cells.
The N  A  I  L
There's also the knight cameo (?) in the opening of the first season of the Owl House, in the clip with King and the plushies Edit: I realized that the owl house is mentioned in the video, nvm
the moment i heard mossbag call a pokémon a digimon i died
I guess theres a hollow knight inside of all of us
Whataboutwhenthedetectorinbugfablestheeverlasingsapling
as a brazilian i don't expected this cameo of hollow knight
There's actually another HK reference in bug fables!  In defiant root, there's a secret alleyway where you can buy charms, (that's not the reference, charms as in the charms from paper mario.) However, the max charm is labeled as 'overcharmed.' Sound familiar?
As a Brazilian, I love Turma da Monica even more rn
There is a reference in the Indie Cross mod for Friday Night Funkin' in the third week against the Bendy ink monster. Just as the Butcher Gang appears, you can hear the Nosk boss fight music.
Wait the Block used Hollow Knight music, man that is the crossover of the century
Bug fables!?!? Now I want that omg hgow hadn't I heard of it
DO NADA UM TURMA DA MÔNICA KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK FDS
lost it when you used the same description for amphibia and the owl house
Another interesting reference: in the less known Souls games, they feature an interesting concept of gameplay known as PvP. Once someone beats you in PvP they use the beloved phrase, “git gud”, which of course is a reference to Hornet when she enters the Hollow Knight boss fight.
Can we make anything that has a rounded square head with vaguely horn like things the new amogus but it's just da knight
Honestly I really need to start playing hollow knight lol
8:32 not illegal just lazy
Hollow knight has reference to anime called berserk in resting grounds. It's one of the spirits.
Don’t you mean Pokémon ? AND REALLY
There's another Hollow knight card in One step from Eden. It has the knight on a bench and it lets the user heal some hp but they have to stand in place for a little bit.
And right beside the fourth angel there is Psycho Jenny from Devil Man Cry Baby
Very interessant 😍 thank you !
I see the nail in Amphibia and think "wait... thats look familiar" and finaly i can die in peace now what i know what is real
did you know hollow knight has a refrence of hollow knight in hollow knight?????????????
just gotta suggest this, i wouldnt go to russia right now
The one more reason to go to Russia joke aged badly
I play hollow knight and just got curse of the dead gods for free cuz its one of the free games for ps plus this month
“the Bible… more importantly, Hollow Knight-“  As a christian i thought this was genuinely hilarious
another episode of the block also used Aeriths theme
You forgot to mention, there is a very obscure game called “Hungry Knight” that may be referencing the indie game “Hollow Knight”. In this game you play as a character who looks very similar to The Knight from Hollow Knight, and the titles have very similar names. Maybe im just going insane.
NEM FUDENDO, TURMA DA MONICA CARAIO
in the owl house there is one more reference because of the last episodes it is called hollow mind
Digimon...
now i know why i love amphibia and toh
Is mossbag obsessed with shovel knight
piplup from digimon
Aqui no Brasil adoramos muito hollow knight
9:29 this didn't age well
I love how he called Ninja a fictional character 🤣
Amphibia and Owl House being described exactly the same was hilarious.
Hearing you pronounce turma da Monica brings me so much joy.
This video is very useful if you want to live in weird fantasy worlds
bible cameo in binding of isaac lol
9:30 uhhhhhhhhhh
Or when shovel knight made it to jsab
Mofo just dissed mah boi Piplup from pokemon like it be one of the cutest pokemon
Hmm Digimon
"A somewhat obscure piece of literature called... The bible"  Best line
9:28 phph beer called Hollow knight
Dead cella soul knight crossover...
In minecraft there is grass, which is probably a reference to greenpath
Bro, I found the knight on my skin!
did not expect to find toh and amphibia here specially since i was tryna get away from the two shows until the next week, guess theres no escape!
7:54 No. It's pokemon
"Now I have another reason to go ro Russia" Yeah... I wouldn't
não acredito que turma da monica apareceu no mossbag
Hear me out… a hollow knight tv show!
MOSSBAG BUG FABLE HAS THE HOLLOW KNIGHT NAIL TOO HOW DARE YOU NOT SAY EVERYTHING ABOUT THE GAME I AM SO MAD AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
ce loco turma da monica, mauricio ta locao kkkkk
“I guess that’s another reason to go to Russia”
The outhouse just showed someone spinning a FAMILIAR STAFF (avatar the last airbender)
9:30 that aged poorly xD
Seeing Turma da Mônica there was not expected
wait what i swore i watched that exact intro a hour ago with you saying you hate refs but my search history says otherwise
Or when shovel knight made it into brawlhalla
There's a "hollowed knight" reference in Kindergarten 2 as well. You get a monstermon card for giving nugget a fidget spinner.
There is another reference in the owl house, there is the hollow knight doll in season 2 episode 3 in kings pile of toys.
among those stuffed animals was a reference to Berserk
Did you know that in the video game “Hollow Knight”, the main character looks just like the vessel from Hollow Knight. This is definitely a reference to a character from “Hollow Knight” that people often refer to as “The Hollow Knight from popular game Hollow Knight”.
living russia. right. ha!
I like your humor, you have gained a sub
"Well, I guess there's one more reason to go to Russia." Aged like milk
06:35 Amphibia is an animated disney show about a young girl stumbling into a strange fantasy world, where she must learn to live among bizarre new creatures, and maybe make a few friends along the way. 07:17 The Owl House is an animated disney show about a young girl stumbling into a strange fantasy world, where she must learn to live among bizarre new creatures, and maybe make a few friends along the way.
Shaa literally means fuck in mongolian
looking to your number of scroll, u actualy noob :v
9:45 i would actually kinda like it
The knight: HORNET?! Also the knight: WHERE THE FUCK ARE WE!?     Try and make this the new lost Suzie memes from deltarune
There’s actually another hollow knight reference in bug fables! I’m not exactly sure where, but there is a small hidden room Kabbu can dig to. In the room you can find the knights broken nail sticking out of a rock :D
Just because of the cameo in dead cells, I will play it lol
Watching this vid reminded me of all of these things, because I love HK. ( also a good build for the black bridge boss, pure nail, frost blast, wolf trap, and tonic)
Mossbag have u seen ur therapist?
Yes obscure  , thank you for giving me such obscure information about a small obscure media
Don t dare to say that piplup is a digimon
In Travis Strikes Again you can get a Hollow Knight T Shirt
Shoutout to Steve from Motion Twin.
wait didn't australian TV also steal the song sans. from undertale for a news segment  are they just looking for indie games to plagiarize
Spent some time trying to find the refrences in deadcells but ummmmm I got way into it and completely forgot about the game until i saw this video again
You missed the fact in Bug fables, the area you can find the "Beserker medal" has the nail in the same room.
lmao funnily enough, when you said that Guacameele is full of references and easter eggs, you listed a few - not inclusing Final Fantasy even though the initial footage of the game clearly showed a Cactuar.
9:13 WHAT HOW DID I NOT KNEW THAT IM BRASILIAN
‘There’s just this dog thing named ‘king’’ THAT IS MR. DOG THING TO YOU
That part where he repeats himself about the disney shows is hilarious
The Knight actually lives in my head rent free
7:46 next to the fourth angel on the right seems to be phsyco jenny from devil man crybaby
"theres that annoying ass penguin from digimon-"  DIGIMON?! DIGIMON!! *dies in laughter*
9:30 that aged poorly
The Knight appeared in Turma da Monica.... Puta que pariu agente tá sempre cheio de surpresa, né?
Just realised you have a yt channel lol I only knew you from r/hollowknightmemes where for some reason there is a cult wanting to sacrifice you so SilkSong finally comes out  But im lad for what I saw lmao
😅 that Russian joke aged well
Bruh I'm from Australia and when they said the block I literally just stopped in confusion
9:27 that did not age well...
I bought Hollow Knight for 6 Dollars; Best product ever!
ГДЕ ПРОДАЕТСЯ ЭТО МАТЬ ЕГО ПИВО ПОЛЫЙ РЫЦАРЬ?!
Guacamelee is so shameless... Most of what they do isn't as much a "reference" as directly taking from other games.
“One more reason to go to Russia” didn’t age well
really thought he was bout to tell me theres a hollow knight reference in the bible
"one more reason to go to Russia"  Boy, that aged well
9:30 well this didn't age well
"Annoying *** Penguin from Digimon" -- Nice
wait one moment the intro seems familiar
Russia joke didn't age well.
I spotted a reference to devilman
I chuckled at the hollow knight beer being a reason to go to rosia  crazy how things change
Or when Shovel Knight made it into Just Shapes & Beats !
Yooooo I didn't expect Bug Fables to be on this list. Also I'm ashamed I missed that reference.
9:31 that didn't age well
ik this man didnt just say that annoying a*s penguin from digimon lmao
Hollow Knight T-shirt in TSA
Mossbag, I think this is a bad time to go to Russia
One time i pissed and my piss sounded pretty similar to the fictional phenomenon known as "rain" which was popularized by an area callled "city of tears" in the hit indie game knows as "Hollow Knight"
im from aus u guy dont have the block and where not that small
Wow that double intro from this and the other video about references completely fucked with my head! Does he or doesnt he like references!?!?!
4:20 rekriem
9:27 так нафиг
for a moment, just for once, i thought i was insane. then i realized is the other way around and it's just a different video
How did you miss the berserk reference in the pile of plushies ;-;
Ok, guess I'll take another trip back into dead cells addiction after that update. Hell, if they've got a Skul weapon, while Skul has a Dead Cells skull, it can't be bad.
Turma da Mônica caught me off guard there
he missed the beserk reference in the owl house op
i like to think what was going on in there head when making the expantion to the four souls:"hm,yes, fnf and among us"
Где взять пиво с Hollow Knight?
9:14 bruh eu já vi isso
I found a refrens in south park s18 e4 5:50 from end (knight skull)
turma da monica
PIPLUP ISN'T DIGIMONNNNNFHDHSHNDXNNAJWJSSJ. Mannn, digimon and pokemon is completely different thingsss
As a Brazilian, I'm genuinely shocked  to see hollow knight in turma da Monica, not in a thousand years I would have thought of that
There is a reference to the Knight in a game called Epic Battle Fantasy 5.  It is part of a series that originated as flash games in the 2000s, and the last one was made a few years ago.  It was not even something I remember…I 100%’d the game a years ago and launched it today for the luls.  I only just noticed it now since I have played Hollow Knight between the time I completed EBF5 and now, but there is a collectible card in the game of “Hollow Soldier”, which looks suspiciously like the Knight.  I came back to this video literally for the sole purpose of contributing to the documentation of Hollow Knight references.
Пивас из россии удивил)
One Step From Eden actually has at least one more HK reference, I think the card is called meditation
Funny how he called Ninja a fictional character.
9:46 "So, you have a blood infection, right?" "I think so? Could you check, doc?" "Sure...  It seems there's actually the entire opposite in your blood!" "Really?" "Yeah, there's 5 Void beings inside! And for some reason one shovel knight."
Gostei do ultimo :)
It funny, growing up I got used to learning about things through references.  I never watched DBZ or played street fighter or watched Star Trek, but I got used to things like that being constantly referenced in pop culture that I just absorbed everything I know about them through cultural osmosis.  Now things I actually like and grew up with are being referenced by other people in my generation as they get older and make their own content and it's a very interesting feeling. I'm finally in on the jokes.
"_________ is an animated Disney show about a young girl stumbling into a strange fantasy world."  Careful. That phrase is owned by Disney.
Getting to play with the nail in Dead Cells made the game significantly more fun  Dead Cells itself was a good game but the crossover really made me happy
All of these were interesting but The Block using the Hollow Knight title theme feels slightly illegal and entirely cursed.
Bug fables actually has another, more overt hollow knight reference! In the chomper caves, there's a hidden room containing the beserker badge. In this room there's a nail strikingly similar to the one carried by the knight.
5:46 There's also what appears to be a bear dressed as Giorno Giovanna from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Vento Aureo/Golden WInd
There is also a HK reference in Terraria. Nit base game but modded. Joost mod.
7:43 the red one next to the fourth angel is a demon from devilman crybaby
Bapanada, velmi artrid helma tolka
a somewhat obscure piece of literature called, "The Bible".... ahahahahahahah
9:30 hahahahahaha, hello from Russia!)
Bruh  Why did they add Ninja?  Haggdgdgd  Nice video bag of Moss I found in my shed
I see a Devilman Crybaby plushie too
In this one swedish show they used the super mario galaxy main theme in one scene which I was not expecting.
Bug fables has ANOTHER reference to hollow knight, the nail can be found in a secret room as a background element, AND the item detector medal is latterly just the knight
ayo i turned 18 when this video was uploaded 😌
Did he just said piplup is annoying and from DIGIMON😠piplup is cute and is from POKÈMON(sorry i was trying to correct you😤😔)
Woulda been really funny if he said The Henry Stickmin Collection instead of amogus
Had no idea it had so many references, and it was referenced in both amphibia and the owl house?! That's pretty big, crazy how big the game is. (And the random house flipping show having used it's music too, lol)
Okay, let me blow your mind: Knights design itself is a reference. Or, to be precise, their weapon and it's skills are a reference to a certain character of a  now obscure game series called MegaMan X and MegaMan Zero.  The Nail's shape is a a reference to MMZ's Z-saber, while the skills are more of a reference to both series - Great Slash(Charged Slash from MMZ 1-4), Cyclone Slash(Hyoryuushou from MegaMan X8), Dash Slash(Shippuga from MMX4).
man, if have one place that I never tought I was gonna see Turma da Mônica, it was here  Brasil keep winning
all i understood from this video is that Hollow Knight is more important than the Bible
I live in Australia and heard that thinking my dad actually started playing
Brasil :D
I love how the hollow knight fandom complains and makes memes about how long silksong is taking, but there were games that took like 12 years to be done, also there is the cyberpunk case.
9:31 you are always welcome!
the fact that he used the same description for owl house and amphibia 😂
9:45 *Infection would like to know your location*
9:12 Não é possível... Até a turma da Mônica, uau.
9:46 "the soul gauge is the power house of the cell"
Something weird about mossbag’s humor is that even when he’s not joking, you could interpret it as a joke and you would have no idea,
"or on the moon" proceeds to show pictures of mars
You should do a fun to send a picture of hollow Knight to the Moon
9:14 nailed the pronunciation there(really, just the R that was a little bit off)            NAILed
6:52 this made me chuckle
still trying to forget space jam 2 can't even make a exception for the rick & morty cameo ,otherwise braindmg is likly :D
Fun fact: this video is a reference to hollow knight
Now make this for jojo references
I WAS RIGHT!! IT WAS IN AMPHIBIA! WOOOOOO Wait… then how did I miss the knight plushie in owl house. Nooooooooo
Oh my God. Mossbag, I love your videos but I missed this one. And my friends pointed out that you mentioned craft beer from Russia. This was my post from reddit. I just want to say thank you!
I'm quite late to this video, but I gave dead cells the classic 2 hours to impress me: Run 2 - I encounter the lore room of Hollow Knight's bench and felt this weird "Hey this feels familiar.." "Nail? WAIT!" And that's how dead cells impressed me in 2 runs.
When he said that the banks steals your geo, I audibly gasped because I had just given her all of mine. I’m checking as soon as I get home 😅
you forgot to mention the discriptions for the dead cells items.  The Pure Nail has the nailsmith's quote from when you complete the pure nail in hollow knight and the vessel outfit has the text from when you are climbing up from the void to obtain void heart
7:40 you miss a reference, you must to have Guts for find it (Or maybe is a reference to Phantom of paradise)
CARALHO NA TURMA DA MÔNICA
Yes ninja is a fictional character
Caralho até no brasil
there’s a somewhat obscure gas called oxygen that is a reference to Hollow Knight, in Hollow knight all the characters actually breathe oxygen. pretty cool stuff!
He call a Pokémon a digimon lol
9:20 is that mike the knight
I think dinorun dx might have some knight hat or something
Fractured Shrine theme and mentioning the Owl House and Amphibia.  Best Video ever.
3:26 I will pay a million to watch that battle
Rick and Morty are in Space Jam 2? Welp, didnt expect any spoilers in this video lol
I like how he uses a gag in reference to the popularity of the Bible  and then uses the same one to reference to the popularity of among us
In Amphibia, also on the sword rack is (I am pretty sure) the Dawnbringer from Skyrim
stuck in a time loop between these 2 videos, send help please
7:53 isnt that pokemon?
Bro you forgot that showel knight also made it into brawlhalla
wanna talk about Shiny Phantump in pokemon?
ScrewJojo references. Soon, the phrase will be "Is that a Hollow Knight reference??"
Ok never expected Turma da Mônica to have a hollow knight referece, today is a happy day for all brazilians that like Hollow Knight
On that same rack is pretty sure that that last sword is dawn breaker from Skyrim at 7:10
you missed one, there is a game called "hollow knight" which i think is a reference. the knight also makes an appearance there, as you see him for a little amount of time at the whole game.
Æ
mossbag talked about turma da mônica and now my life is complete.
9:12 turma da mônica makes a reference about hollow knight and my life is now complete.
6:54 FINALLY! THAT MEANS WE CAN FINALLY CONNECT HOLLOW KNIGHT AND EARTHBOUND
I have a feeling he doesn't like references
Steampunk knight is tattoo material
Dead Cells was added to the game Soul Knight lmao
The moment Shovel Knight made into Just Shapes and Beats
i will just say Turma da Mônica is amazing
5:49 at the corner of the hollow knight drawing, the Chinese it says literally translates to hollow knight, that’s pretty cool.
AMONG US
animated Disney show about a young girl stumbling into a strange fantasy world where she must learn to live among bizarre new creatures and maybe even make a few friends along the way
The KNight makes a appearance in hollow knight
or when shovel knight was in brawlhalla
I think the third sword on the weapon rack in Amphibia is the Dawnbreaker from Skyrim.
"The annoying penguin from Digimon" _9999 Emotional Damage to Piplup_
Media with bugs: exists  Hollow Knight: *bonjour*
the Russian craft beer is literally called "the hollow knight"
Porra Mauricio kkkkk, até você?
nem fudendo monica kkkk
I think there's a very subtle hollow knight reference in this obscure upcoming game called Hollow Knight Silksong Hollow Knight silksong is a game about a girl stumbling into a strange fantasy world, where she must learn to live among bizzare, new creatures, and maybe even make a few friends along the way. If you think about that, it might be a reference to various disney animated shows which themselves have references to hollow knight, so it's sort of a double reference! If you look very closely you can even see a few similarities in the name Hollow knight silksong seems to be heavily inspired by Hollow Knight, it basically copies the artstyle and gameplay of it. I'm tired of these hollow knight clones, but at  least Hollow Knight silksong seems to be paying homage to what it copies.
BRAZIL MENTIONED!!!!!!!
Did you guys know Shovel Knight is in Shovel Knight?
That thumbnail is very cute
0:38 he‘s also in for honor!!!
sickle cell anemia is a reference to the horn things on the knight
Dandara and Turma de Monica. Thats it. Thats all the Brazillian representation I needed. Pack it up boys.
I am so obsessed with this game at the moment. I wish there was a 2d animated hollow knight tv show
maybe stolas from helluva boss is inspired or is a reference to grimm but im not sure
The bottom sword on the sword rack in amphibia is a sword from dragon quest I think
The binding of isaac: four souls the golden idol is a reference to the spelunky by the way play spelunky 1 & 2
7:46 It actually look like Unn
9:15 wait what   im brazillian and i never thought i'd ever see this
Bro I had no idea the nail was in dead cells
Space jam 2 was fucking lame
It is so obvious that he was getting this above 20 Minutes but I love the way he did it.
Ok the game gear and digimon have to be on purpose right
Hearing the hk theme on that Australian show was like hearing megalovania on the korean dramas my parents watch everyday
9:14 HERE IS BRAZIL !!
Wholesome thumbnail :)
Man, there references about HK every where! I am Brazilian and I know "Turma da Monica" but I never heard that reference on the comics of it, good to know. But I know there are reference of jojo on some of it, besides A LOT OF OTHER REFERENCES OF ANOTHER TYPES ON IT
Damn he really took a blow at my two favorite shows and I feel so attacked-
King the best character tho
Remember when shovel knight made it into  the world
Lmao that roast on Amphibia and Owl House
imagine seeing that TV show suddenly without knowing this beforehand. I think it would break my brain.
Que legal comentarem sobre turma da mônica, é um quadrinho muito popular aqui no Brasil, e com muita frequência fazem diversas referências bacanas, excelente vídeo e parabéns pelo canal!!
The plush in The Owl House looks more like the actual Hollow Knight than the regular Knight.
In Monolith the secret final boss dreams up the Radiance and you have to fight it.
I didn't know so many pieces of media reference famous game Hungry Knight. Thanks for such an informative video PewDiePie.
3:48 swear to god I though you were gonna say the Bible had a reference to Hollow Knight.
"The annoying as hell penguin from digimon" As we all know, Piplup is from Digimon.
I got stuck in a loop of watching these two Easter eggs videos. HELP ME
Isn't he kinda similar to hello kitty? In a way because he is of a simple design with little to no facial expressions? Idk why that comparison came to mind.
it makes me incredibly happy that there’s a hollow knight reference in the owl house
i loved the video thks
I swear if Isaac Clarke isn’t in Four Souls I will riot!
when the bug fables
there's another easter egg in dead cells, in the diary at the beginning, you can read it and there's an homage to hollow knight. I discovered this a few days ago while revisiting the game
I know about one step from eden pretty well. It has reference to EVERYTHING
But the hollow knight does appear in some people's blood, if you look closely. Sickle cells kinda look like his horns
Promenade of the condemned is not the third level
"Annoying ass penguin from digimon." Every 90's kid in the chat: look! A fool!
They’re sleeping on Hornet
7:12 THE THIRD SWORD IS A REFERENCE TO THE DAWNBREAKER FROM SKYRIM
9:14 holy shit i dint know thatand im a braziliam and a prety big fan of that comic,basically its like batman but for brazilians,i think there isnt a single kid in brazil that doesnt know that comic.
OH MY GOD IS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING BRAZIL REFERENCE
That dig at the Disney channel’s show was too funny
next to the fiurth angel in the season 1 intro of Owl House the pink hairy plush is Psycho Jenny from Devilman
my favorite knight cameo is in the game hollow knight
Ok so I was playing dead cells right now and found a lecturn at one of the randomley generated starts to the game and one of the pages straight up just says “Hollow Knight”, as well as some other games.
Bruh
"I love refrigeratos" gave me the same feeling 0:01
What if it was all Hollow Knight all along...
7:52 *crying* *CHIMCHAR SUCKS TOO!*
I've head the dungeon defender theme on British reality telly a few times. Never rember where but it always makes me go hang on I recognise that.
Ok but one step from Eden is actually fire
8:00 wtf is femto doing in a kid show OMG IM DEAD
so this is how deep the rabbit hole goes
7:53 how dare you.. say that again and feel THE POKEMON HELL
If cherry to lay low we might see a "references of Hollow Knight in Hollow Knight". But honestly I might graduate from this obsession because Metroid Dread and Ori 2 are giving me everything I promised myself from Silksong. I still want team cherry to be punished in some way with how they handled marketing, I mean comeon, hiring another employee for pr is not that difficult.
say shovel knight again
A somewhat obscure piece of literature, “THE BIBLE”!
I wouldn't be surprised if hollow knight started apering on tv or on the moon or in our blood cells
I love Binding of Isaac just as much as Hollow Knight
That’s Pokémon not digimon
You REALLY didn't have to make that connection dog. Is that fucking Griffith in the bottom right?!?! 7:38
"unfunny actors performing terrible skits" Never have I been so offended by something I 100% agree with  Except David Pumpkins. He's great.
At 7:12 he was pretty cringe not acknowledging the obvious Dawnbreaker reference from Skyrim. Dawnbreaker is collected after completing the quest, "The Break of Dawn." This quest is collected after finding the Meridia's Beacon item in one of the other chests throughout the games roughly 400 total hours or after visiting the Statue of Meridia. It is one of the 16 Daedric artifacts found in the game. You can tell this is true as it has the same pommel, and a similar leather wrapped handle. It also showcases the bright sun which shows up in the art for it in Skyrim. It could be obviously missed unless you have spent far too much time in Skyrim. I myself have 160 hours of fully active time.
o knight aparecendo na turma da monica é foda kkkkkkk
Cornifer is in LA-MULANA 2 console versions as a shopkeeper.
Whoever made Polish subtitles: I see you.
take a shot every time mossbag says "knight"
Mano eu tenho esse gibi da turma da Monica
Actually Bug Fables has a surprising amount of Hollow Knight references. Aside from the reference to Millibelle, there's also a medal in the game called the "Detector" that looks surprisingly like the Knight, and you can find a secret room in the Golden Hills with a Nail stuck in a rock.
9:44 Yo...that's not the moon.
Love the Animated shows same plot gag
Moon Knight spotted!
Damn bro, i live in Brazil and used to watch turma da monica, but holy shit, i never saw that they had so many pop cultire references, tehy even got god damn jojo references in there bro
ah yes...."digimon", correct
How is there a half cameo
When dead cells turn into hollow knight
7:54 I think that's just a normal penguin plush......
I love how this masterpiece has had its thumbnail and title changed like 4 times
9:40 ..... Is that motherfucking giorno up there
9:22 Is that Moon Knight?
SHAWN!!!!
Other video: "I hate references." This video: "I love references."
dead cells is one of my favorite games
As a Brazilian, i can Tell that "turma da Monica" made hundreds of references, like a reference to "one punch Man", or that time when they put almost ALL Marvel characters in a kind of super villains Meeting
next time a mars rover heads over to mars, they better carry a hollow knight plushie with them lol the knight will be the first being on mars lol (from earth, the aliens ARE there)
Scavengers from rainworld if born with a white head and a standard black-spiked body , they bizarrely resemble the Hollow knigth
As a lover of Hollow Knight, Amphibia, and The Owl House, I can't believe I missed the references in both shows!
I'm super tired right now, and I thought he was going to say that there was a hollow knight reference in the bible
Bro the block what a classic
The crewmate, a somewhat obscure piece of media known as...The Bible.
1:10 There is another
That game gear best be a joke or I will have to come back and like this video
The thumbnail is everything for me tho
because hollow knight is connected to fortnite that means that hollow knight is connected to naruto
8:07 you also forgot the pig from gravity falls on the left
awesome
3:58 as someone who's confused at all the binding of isaac titles that kh joke made me realize the irony lol
Hollow Knight better not show up in my blood cells, that place is reserved for Shovel Knight!
Guys guys guys guys the knight is in a pretty obscure game called ‘hollow knight’ 😳😳😳😳😳😳
ngl this could be shortened down to like 5 minutes but hey gotta get that 10 minute mark
this guy sounds familiar
You forgot about the Hollow Knight reference in Hollow Knight.
is redball from devilman
If you haven’t played bug fables yet, stop reading this comment and PLAY IT NOW DANG IT
next to 4th angel
The owl house actually references griffith from beserk not egg man
I'm still waiting the day when Amphibia launch in disney plus in finland
İ am going to moon and put a hollow Knight reference on it new live goal acquired
amogus
When you point at the Gameboy and pretend it's a game gear 😂😂 and Ninja is a fictional character.
6:52 that is the game boy color
WHY IS THIS VIDEO THE SAME AS THE LAST VIDEO WHY IS HE SUDDENLY SAYING HE LOVES REFERENCES WHEN HE SAYS HE HATES REFERENCES IN THE VIDEO JUST BEFORE THIS ONE PLEASE I AM SO CONFUSED AND THIS IS HURTING MY BRAIN
6:35 the fact that the frogs eat bugs and everyone in Hollownest is a bug leads me to believe that little ghost was eaten alive
The intro is the exact opposite of the other reference video lol
fun fact: the name of the craft beer from russia is actually "Hollow Knight".
I see what you did there in the start
i wonder what is amongus
"Infact the title of the game  binding of Isaac is actually a reference to a somewhat obscure piece of literature known as *T H E B I B L E* "
i like it in dead cells lol
Wasn't expecting to see Turma da Mônica appear on a video about Hollow Knight lmao love it
"I'd like to think the knight and shovel knight would be friends if the met in the real world" dude the knight literally kills everything it stumbles upon. That's literally the gameplay of hollow knight, wandering around and killing everything
mossbag is a digimon hater istg
I'm so short I could cosplay as hollow knight
FINALLY someone mentioned the vessel plush that king has in the owl hose opening, I noticed that before and was waiting for someone to mention it
Mossbag be like “top 10 times I went insane due to hollow Knight”
I think just spotted a hollow knight reference in skul.  The second boss is two fast sisters, who at the beginning of the fight, use the moveset from the Mantis lords
Theres a hollow knight in your video
Gee, I wonder if there's any Hollow Knight references in the Bible!
nem fudendo hollow knight na turma da monica
mossbag pulled a dunkey pokemon pickachu evvee
I feel like you going insane, you doing good?
After seeing that Amphibia had a reference, I was pretty surprised. I never would've thought it would've have one, so I literally went, "what's next, Owl House?"
9:29 it's not just an appearance, it says on the side that the name of the beer is literally "hollow knight"
Shovel knight was also in bloodstained.
We should have a Hollow Knight TV show
4:42 HE SAID IT HE SAID IT
I’m so glad you mentioned Four Souls. Also Requiem is not the first expansion. I’m The Four Souls Guy. There was the Kick Starter Expansion, Four Souls + Expansion. The Hallow Knight Cards are not even in The Requiem Expansion, they are in the Warpzone Expansion.
I do know of a definite cameo in a game called Blood Will Be Spilled, it's a mediocre Steamworld heist esque like game that has glitches, not much thought to choosing since its very one way with skill points, and a sound design that delays too much, but in the first minutes of the game, you can see the knight sitting in a bar stool by his lonesome
In my modded terraria playthrough there have been a ton of hollow knight references in random mods lmao
when i say "the block" appear as a chapter at the bottom of my screen as an australian i nearly died of disbelief
7:07 HAHA MY SISTER CALLED ME INSANE, BUT I KNEW IT!… what do you mean I’m still crazy?
It's like cartoons nowadays just discovered the concept of isekai....
As someone from Australia I can understand the confusion of thinking 800 episodes means 800 houses, it takes multiple episodes per house approximately 5 houses per 10 episodes (as multiples houses are being worked on at once) leaving us with 400 houses which is much more accurate
We can now connect hollow knight to Fortnite Well said
Who made your thumbnail? Its really cool! :D
2:53 SHE DOES WHAT?
i wasn't gonna comment, but then i saw "Turma da Mônica" and as a brazilian i'm legally bound to admit to being brazilian at a mention of brazilian things in international content and be super hype about it.  have a like, friend, and in the name of my brazilian brothers i wish your channel steady growth
hey mossbag, i watched all your hollow knight lore videos and when someone asked me about the hunter i still had nothing. whats up?
I'm going to pester you every video you upload until you create a lore video on the Knight
"We can now connect hollow knight to fortnite."  Dont you fucking dare give them ideas.  If the knight gets added to fortnite, I will fucking kill myself.
This was probs just a slip of the tongue, but....that annoying ass penguin is not from Digimon. It's from Pokemon.
The Nyakuza Metro DLC from A Hat in Time, in the Rumbi Factory (Time Rift), right at the start of the level there is a light pole that's resembles (and is mostly like a reference) the one from Hollow Knight.
probably doesnt count but there is a mod thats not directly hollow knight related but adds the nails as weapons and the knight's armour as a cosmetic, i think it might be joost mod.
Hay you forget hollow knight refrence in game caled hollow knight. im the onle one hi knows that?
Mossbag? Honey!   Yes?  What's that in my room?  OMG is that a hollow knight reference!!!  What- NO, this is real life?!  Ohh, we might want to get away before it tries to steal our soul essence...   Wait whaAAAAAAAAARRRGGGGH!    And then Mossbag grabbed his mossberg
Bro thank you for telling me about that dead cells update, I might as well download it again. One of my favourite games ever!
So Shovel Knight, Hollow Knight and the Black Knight from Scooby Doo walks into a bar--
Yeah forager is open world when there’s a max island’s
What if everyone in the HK community worked together to solve unexplained parts of the lore and mossbag made a complete lore v2 video
How the eff am I watching a mossbag video, going "ooe nice obscurish hollow knight content" and "huh what a soothing voice sounds familiar" and only THEN notice I'm watching a mossbag video???
I love hollow knight references but seeing some love for hyper light drifter really made my day man
It looks like in the pile of polishes there’s also a reference to gravity falls next to the knight, the pig plush looks just like waddles
Connifer is in La Mulana 2
I don't want to sound rude but saying Piplup is a Digimon made me so pissed lmao
Just look at him, blabbering about Hollow Knight cameos like an anime character.
2021 (almost 2022) and Mossbag still doesn't know the difference between Digimon and Pokemon.
I think I heard " This annoying penguin from Digimon. ", and I'm pretty sure Piplup is from Pokemon.
As a brazilian, seeing the knight in Turma da Mônica was the least thing I was expecting to see, but I'm surprised in a good way
9:12 enesperado turma da monica so apareceu
is this a deja vu?
The bible? Never heard of it
I would add to this list the Dutch TV show "Pak de Macht" where in the episode "De Koninklijke Shell" of april 29, 2021 they use the music of the Fungal waste during a segment.
plz  make a life blood lore vid thx
In the owl house opening I spotted a furry red smiling character that's probably referencing psycho Jenny from Devilman Crybaby
Amoongus
6:52 thats not a game gear thats a game boy
OH I DIDNT KNOW THE BF AND GF CARDS WERE ACTUALLY REAL BAHAHAHA
9:46 there was an easy lifeblood joke and you missed it.
Did you know that the title of hollow knight is actually a reference to a game called "hollow knight"? Pretty cool eh?
Nem ferrando que Turma da Mônica apareceu nesse vídeo haha
I can’t wait for Silksong
Yeay skull has thing's
There's another one in Bug Fables. In the room where one of the medals, iirc Berserker, is found, their Nail can be seen
As someone who plays a lot of dead cells, the pure nail is a really interesting weapons, less for the upwards and downwards attacks, and more for the fact that it's the only melee weapon that allows you to move while attacking
Annoying ass penguin from Digimon? Ummm, kind sir, that is a pokemon… however, yes, piplup is indeed annoying
Beat hollow knight but get all carms in order of the screen
Annoying ass penguin from digimon *7:54
9:41 I would pay to get the knight in my blood cells.
Digimon penguin ???? haha that penguin is from pokemon uwu
Did not come into this video expecting the block to come up, and yeah it's a bad show dont watch it
7:53 why
Wait a minute I remember seeing this in a dream The deadcells one with the vessel outfit
9:21 the guy in the white hood and armour is the moon knight ("random bullshit go" meme guy)
so nice for binding of isaac to partner up with the bible :)
This video was posted onto YouTube, which is a reference to an obscure company know as “Google” who purchased YouTube a few years ago.
No one mentioned that in the other video he said he hates reference.
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
everyone always misses the reference in Amphibia, but the sword at the bottom is a Rohan sword from the Lord of the Rings
Instead of  "Everything is a Jojo reference"  We can now say; "Everything is a Hollow Knight reference"
Okay so, as a Brazilian, Turma da Mônica's (Mônica's pals) raised me, and that reference to Hollow Knight has brought me SO MANY MEMORIES
The australian show one reminds me of when a promo for a french skit show used Spider Dance from Undertale for some reason
2:51 THAT BITCH! I DIDNT KNOW SHE DID THAT!?!?!?! IM TAKING MY MONEY OUT
Did team cherry make dead cells? If they did, that’s the collab with fall guys
Porra Maurício.
There's a really obscure reference in hollow night to a real-world category of creatures called "insects". Like, if you look really hard, you start to see insects in the game. Pretty sure I must be the first person to notice this one.
The question that nobody is asking about Hornet saying "shaw": what if she's just from Louisiana?
next thing we know you'll be telling us there's a hollow knight reference in silksong!
The difference between the two starts to the intros of the media videos made me crack up
Nice pronunciation of Turma da Mônica. I was not expecting that at all hahaha
I got one for you. Quacamelee 2 featured a pic of Shovel Knight and our Vessel Knight.  Shovel Knight songs are featured in Just shapes and Beats (with visuals).  Just Shapes and Beats has a boss with Spiderdance song remix, from Undertale.  Sans from Undertale is featured in Super Smash Bros Ultimate :)
99% of the vid or idk be like: the knight
9:27 the words on the can literally is the name of the game in russian
Fun fact: shovel knight actually had a crossover with Arby's
9:27 the words on the left picture literally translates as "Hollow knight".
last night i saw a bug that resembled The Old Stag from Hollow Knight 0.o
The hollow knight skin in dead cells was originally different and detailed, but ultimately got scrapped (there was an accidental release on Linux I believe, where you can see said skin) but it looked cursed af
I played Dead Cells yesterday for the first time but didn't know about the crossover, so when I saw the bench I went "haha this is kinda like Hollow Knight :)" and got the Pure Nail. needless to say, a welcome surprise.
Banger of a video
It's not really a game in itself, but in the Calamity mod for Terraria, you can obtain all the forms of the knights nail, including the normal and awoken dream nail which lets you use attacks such as great slash, dash slash, cyclone slash, and grants the projectile effect of gruberfly's elegy
You missed Burger King. If you go to Burger King and order a burger, the burger usually has meat in it. Meat is organic and comes from living creatures. Bugs like the knight are living creatures. Therefore, Burger King has a Hollow Knight reference.
ненавижу пиво но я хОЧУ ЭТУ БАНОЧКУ С НАШИМ РЫЦАРЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕМММ
Oooh maaan, already in MY blood cells
shovel knight is really meh i dont know why everyone likes it
WHAT? HOLLOW KNIGHT AND SHOVEL KNIGHT APPEARS IN TURMA DA MÔNICA?  PUTA QUE PARIU EU PRECISO DISSO
I don’t know if you knew this, but there’s a super obscure Hollow Knight reference on Reddit by an RPer known as Princess_SHAW.  The only things connecting him to Hollow Knight are literally everything on his profile, so I understand that many people didn’t quite get the reference. He’s not very prevalent on Reddit, and only has 110,000 karma. Amateur numbers, I know. He also doesn’t appear too often on the subreddit normal Hollow Knight fans go to, but instead the sad garbage dump known as r/HollowKnightMemes, where the lowest of the low go to wallow in filth and grime.  (I hope you understand this is sarcasm, as I love both Princess_SHAW and the subreddit, 110,000 is a CRAP TON of karma, and he is very prevalent.)
Awesome video 👍
I used hollow knight as a basis for one of my main characters battle garb. It's mostly just bones and a cloak with more bones with a skull on the head.
Man only now do i realize how so many disney shows are the exact fucking same
I think I found a pretty obscure YouTuber called mossbag
Do I see a Devilman Crybaby (psycho jenny) plushie as well?
God i need to play this game again i got lost at the end of the game and havnt played in years
I just got finessed into watching both videos hahahahah great content
"Annoying penguin from digimon" *Confusion*
I can't believe you mentioned Turma da Mônica also that green elephant is called Jotalhão, the reference being he's dressed as gandalf
holy shit you actually found the reference in Turma da Monica as a brazilian, i commend you for your efforts
The Knight is a worthy opponent to Mickey mouse *They are both everywhere*
Not sure if it counts, but there is this Terraria mod called Redemption, that has two whole armor sets and multiple weapons based on the shade cloak shadelings, and shade soul.
3:02 austrian economics moment
never thought that i would see turma da mônica in a mossbag video, maurício de souza's copyright infrigement powers grow stronger by the day
hollow knight is in my cancer
“Like another fictional figure named ninja” well is he wrong
I hate the fact that I didn't notice the nail or the master sword in that Amphibia episode.
Didnt jump king's babe of ascension dlc have a hk painting or am i thinking wrong
That anoying ass penguin from digimon
In Bug Fables you can also find a nail (As in, the weapon.) in the Mother Chomper Cave, and the Detector Medal looks like a vessel's head.
Hey mossbag , would you be interested in a dead cells vid, that’d be awesome!
I've had my eye on the Dead Cells fandom for a bit, between this update and being a HLD fan. So this update might have me buying the game.
7:53 why would you do my 2nd favorite "digimon" like that
The central bank joke made my day
3:38 dont know why but this joke just hit me way too hard
*Ahem...*  _SHAA!!_
So the weirdest thing happened right, I was watching swedish TV one evening and as i’m watching this show called “din hjärna” (or your brain), a show which as the name suggests looked into the brain and how it works, suddenly queens gardens ost starts playing in the background. And this isn’t a one of thing, there were like 8 different songs from in game with christopher larkin credited at the end credits. Clearly the shows music director was a big hollow knight fan lol.
Content famine, huh?
You forgot shovel knight from brawlhalla
There is a refrence of hollow knight in hollow knight
Holy shit we need Silksong lol
Bro what the fuck you said you hate references
In a smithing show someone built a hollow knight nail and tested it out not sure what show it was but you could probably find it in a simple YouTube seatch
Turma da Mônica
Those two cartoons you mentioned, Amphibia and The Owl house look adorable. A friend of mine often shows me cool toonz that I wouldn't see otherwise, I wonder if those are ones he might show me? Also, about that music use in the Block: I don't know what to say about that. Its weird. And I say that as a Australian, which means I don't even get my own country.
Ah yes the penguin from digimon
fall guys released a limited time "prisoner" costume which looks a lot like the thumbnail of this video
Did you know in popular Metroidvania Hollow knight they is MANY hollow knight references
Baby Vessel baba vessel
the anoyying ass penguin from digimon ? or pokemon?
Well, i wasn't expecting "turma da Monica" in this video          THIS IS A MOTHERFUCKING BRAZILIAN REFERENCE!!??
As a Brazilian it's always funny when someone from other countries discovers Turma da Mônica (Monica's Gang or Monica's and Friends - I don't know how you translate it)
One Step from Eden also has a spell called “Rest” which has art that references the benches from Hollow Knight.
DED cel
BRAZIL MENTIONED!
Im a brazilian and when u talked about ''turma da monica'' i was like: WAIT WHAT-..WHAT THE ACTUALLY FUCK-
7:53 Digimon.
There’s a Steven Universe references in Guacamelee 2 as well
In Guacamele
The Block's reference reminds me of how a show used Ori and the Will of the Wisp's soundtrack in one of their episodes but I can't remember what the show was called
There are actually some references of other games in Hollow Knight, but the only one I can remember off of the top of my head is the "Dashmaster" charm, which looks like Sans from Undertale.
God damn there's even a Devilman reference in that owl house frame
in revita theres a relic called broken nail referencing hollow knight
'Another fictional character who appears in Fall Guys is Ninja.' I almost choked when i heard this
Can’t believe he forgot about Hollow Knight being referenced in Hollow Knight.
What’s actually funny is that Australia uses some of the funniest songs sometimes. For example, they used sans’ theme for a video about life after COVID or something, and, I shit you not, used dreams ‘Mask’ on the news to tell people to keep wearing their masks.
0:39 or when shovel knight made it into just shapes and beats
havent known about that hollow knight beer, i live in russia tho. no one of my friends have seen this, lol
"We've finished running tests on your badger thing, turns out it's condition is irreversible" So  This reference convinced me to watch Rick and morty
I remember hearing a slightly remixed version of a Hollow knight soundtrack in a French cooking show to give a spooky vibe. Don't know if they had any right for it...
Piplup called as annoying ass penguin from digimon  -1 respect
In the owl house you can also see one plushy that is strikingly similar to griffith from beserk. The design isn't exactly the same, don't know if that was on purpose.
I don't think you mentioned one of the references, so in this obscure game (I think its called hollow knight) you actually play the entire game as the knight.
i love how you pointed it out without pressing on it at all that Amphibia and The Owl house are basically the exact same show with the exact same premise and almost the exact same artstyle xD
dang mossbag having some trouble with hornet
The fact that he just repeated the description of owl house and anphibia made me laugh
play Rain World
as a Brazilian, i got extremely surprised to see a lot of references in Turma da Monica comic
Wtf, turma da monica has a hollow knight reference? I always knew they liked to add references to modern media, but not this modern. Last time i checked, they were still making references to super mario. (For reference, turma da monica is 51 years old and a lot of people in brazil, including me, grew up reading it)
Shovel Knight also made it into For Honor lmao
The Russian beer's name is literally Hollow Knight, lmao
I like how he said his opposite intro
No blood cells anymore. Only Hollow Knight
im gonna ignore how he called Piplup a Digimon cuz i like this channel
silksong in February
4:53 this actually ruined my day
too bad there isnt any video where someone talks about easter eggs in hollow knight
"there's that annoying ass penguin from digimon" hm... i think some pokemon's fans exploded :D
I would totally start playing fall guys if there was a hollow knight skin
I am Brazilian and I need to find that comic of Turma da Monica were the knight appears
Just a small reference: you can see a small Knight around timestamp 2:18-2:19 on a video called "Gilgamesh | Destripando la Historia" which is a spanish music video about history, it has many references to a lot of stuff.
Australian here, actually there aren’t that many houses here. My house has been renovated 3 times now, please help they won’t stop coming back
EU PRECISO DESSE GIBI DA TURMA DA MÔNICA COM O HOLLOW KNIGHT KKKKKKKKKKKKK
Man get your facts right and get yo long as* goofy shoes outta here you clown 🤡
The Leiana sisters in Skul the hero slayer are 100% an homage to the mantis lords
if you really think about it, there're hollow knight references in our blood. Antibodies have a very similar shape, they seem to have the same horns as the knight. Some would argue that it's just a coincidence, but since the antibodies have a role in "defeating an illness that's attacking members of a society of little beings by sacrificing themselves for the cause"... I think there's plenty of similarities
You missed an Easter egg! In the hit game "Hollow Knight" (made by Team Cherry), by navigating through the main menu and hitting "Start Game," you will be able to see the knight walking through a wasteland! By watching this cutscene, you will also unlock him as a playable character.
Thank you for the video, I enjoyed it very much.
Oh god it’s a perfect loop
does he love or hate references someone tell me
Gosh I love this game, it makes me so happy to see it in so many different pieces of media, thanks for doing the research and uploading Mossbag.
Glad to see forager in here!
The owl house and aphiba
Remember hearing the hollow knight theme while watching the block and just had to silently get excited cause my parents were with me
TURMA DA MONICA!!!!
8:41 that does remind me of the time they used "Leaving earth" from mass effect 3 in germany's next top model
anyone else hear him call piplup a digimon
How dare u call Elefante as "bug green elephant"?!! 😤😤😤😤 (also pretty cool video)
I think this video's introduction is a reference to the Hidden Easter eggs in hollow knight video.
Dude. I play one step from eden all the time. My favorite character is Selicy. How did I not know the goated Ice needle heads reference. Wow.
What's interesting about Owl House is that because Eda goes over to the Human Realm to get trinkets to sell in the Demon Realm, the Hollow Night reference in Owl House might have been an actual Knight plushie Eda found and gave to King.
I saw femto in there
So what your telling me is that the knight is holy?
Can't wait until the hollow night Easter egg in the upcoming game silk song
Brazillian here, what the hell
7:11 And the one beneath the Master Sword vaguely reminds me of Shadow of the Colossus.
“The title of the game, Binding of Isaac, is actually a reference to a somewhat obscure piece of literature known as: the Bible.”  As a Christian, let me just say that I lol-ed
"Unfunny actors doing skits" LMAO
calling piplup an annoying ass penguin from digimon broke my heart
Hollow knight from hollow knight shows up in hit indie game hollow knight by team cherry.
mossbag: The annoying ass penguin from digimon  me, whos favorite pokemon is piplup: ;-;
I live in Russia but this beer isn't sold in my city So close yet so far................
BRAZIL REFERENCE
2:27 mossbag mentioned bug fables my day is made
I'm from Brazil and "turma da Monica" (Monica's gang) is one of the most influential and famous brazilians midia, it's like a symbol to us, very glad it was mentioned.
Turma da Mônica uahsuahauushsuh
3:46 I straight up thought he was gonna say "There's actually a Hollow Kight reference hidden in The Bible"
the comparison from amphibia and owl house was amazing
All that references and homages but still no silksong. Sad!
The Slay the Spire mod is hella good.
I could've lived my whole life without knowing that the Hollow Knight Theme was used in an episode of the block What the fuck have you done to me
No fucking way I thought that block thing was a dream
I laughed really loud when I saw that "Turma da Mônica" appeared in the video  Brasileiros agora eu falo com vocês Isso n foi definitivamente a coisa mais aleatória que vcs ja viram?
There was a Devilman Crybaby reference in that pile of plushies, and Griffith from Berserk was in there too
Guys help I’m stuck in a loop
Weren't they also supposed to add a Knight skin in amon us?
i want hollow knight injected into my bloodstream
Liking space jam 2 is the equivalent to having less than room temp iq.
Wasn't there a T-shirt about Hollow Knight in Travis Strikes Again?
The Knight has no choice but to attack Shovel Knight on sight. If it doesn't take Shovel Knight out then it'll never win the cameo race, seriously have you seen how big of a lead Shovel Knight has!?
glad the owl house was mentioned (the similar descriptions between amphibia and the show were hilarious), and fun fact! the knight plushie actually appears twice in the series. of course in the season 1 intro, but also in the season 2 episode echos of the past, where it is seen in another pile of king’s plushies.  also, i like to think the designs of the guard masks and even the mask of the main antagonist is an accidental derivative of the game’s style.
There’s this one hidden gem called “Hollow Knight” and it has major Hollow Knight references. It’s supposedly getting a sequel that has a bunch of references as well. There’s also a Easter egg in fallout: 76 as both games include many many bugs. I just made a reference to hollow Knight, as I was beating a dead horse, just like how you can beat a dead Nosk and a dead Zote.
En dead cells me encontré ese cuadro de hollow knight y la armadura y la palanca de Gordon freeman
This video was actually super fun... I would love to see a part 2
7:43 I was thinking that it was the final boss of the campaign in Kirby star allies
asdfghjk hinka
One of my favorite shows referencing one of my favorite games?
Ah yes, Piplup is from Digimon and not Pokemon. (7:49)
Turma da monica is still alive? i tought the comic dissapeared years ago
BRAZIL MENTIONED
This is just the inverted version
Is respect the shitposting
The whiplash i got after watching the previous video is immense
I wonder if there are any Hollow Knight references in Silksong?
There’s a song from two spanish guys called Pascu and Rodri, in a part of their song “Gilgamesh” (in the underworld) there’s a little cameo in the background!
I'm so proud to play hollow knight!
i Can't Believe Turma da Mônica has Fucking Hollow Knight on it, that was Not Expected at All
7:37  Griffith.....
Somewhere in these comments I bet I'm going to find someone trying to reference the hollow knight "village sign" or what ever it's called, to the small indie game called among us due to the sus shapes on the sign
hey wait didn't you say in the last video you hate crossovers?
I also love how Hollow Knight has random cameos in The Owl House and Amphibia. Nothing solidifies how popular something is until Disney acknowledges it.
one time one of the news here uses subnoutica
Humor on point as always king
Oh there’s also a hidden room in bug fables where you can find the broken nail
As a Brazilian, I am ashamed of not knowing the existence of a Hollow Knight reference in simply THE MOST famous brazilian comic that had ever existed.
Still watching the video so not sure if it’s included but there’s also a Secret area in Bug Fables with a Nail
I have been restraining myself for years now, but I think that's it. Now I will buy Dead Cells.
....HK in Turma da Monica...? HOW DID I MISS T H A T?!?!?!
I am russian, and yeah, this is a reference it is literally called "hollow knight"
…or when shovel knight made it into Just Shapes & Beats
Russian language has an easter egg to hollow knight. Russian "иди нах"(shorter version of "иди нахуй" which is translated as "fuck you") reminds Hornet's "idi nah" during string attack. Even meaning is close enough
I think he likes the Shovel knight         Just a little
Is the main character referred to as a knight in the game? I could’ve sworn it was only ever referred to as a vessel.
7:41 you missed papyrus
There are more references to hollow knight in Dead Cells, like the vessels head in one lore room and a few murals that relate to hollow knight in high peak castle
"there was also the annoying ass penguin from digimon" just so ya know it is a water type starter Pokemon from Pokemon  Ur welcome
as a brazilian, seeing you mentioning Turma da Mônica made me very happy
The Knight could be a secret boss for Bug Fables
hollow knight is the game that
WHAT?? Bruh, Im from Brazil and I have NEVER seen that comic in Turma da Mônica.
There’s definitely going to be tons of hollow knight references in my upcoming hollow Knight comic series-
damn, i didn't realize the knight's glory has spread so far and wide! it's so great to see him being appreciated <3
femto? 8:00
The Golden Idol in Isaac is from Spelunky. That's sick.
Shovel knight would win against the knight.  All he needs to do is step on him.
9:13 EITA MERDA A TURMA DA MÔNICA TÁ FAZENDO REFERÊNCIA A HOLLOW KNIGHT 👌😳✌️
The writing in the corner at 5:47 (虚空騎士) even translates to Hollow Knight too
I am sorry for all the people that will go to the coments without understanding de sarcasm in this video
just wanted to add, there's another hollow knight reference in bug fables! in one of the secret bosses, if you dig under somewhere, you'll find a room with a hollow knight styled nail.
Nosso momento BRs: 9:10
I watched Amphibia a month ago and immediately recognised the nail, had to pause for a second cause i got so hyped, that was so unexpected and cool
6:52 That..looks more like a gameboy to me than a game gear
You can link Mario with Hollow knight Mario to Smash which has Megaman,  Megaman is in MVC which has thanos Thanos is in Fortnite that has Ninja, Ninja is fall guy which also has the AMOGUS character Amogus in Binding of isaac which also has Hollow knight.   I call this 2 degrees from Mario
The Nameless King's sword spear was also on the wall in that swordmaster's "day care".
I love Bug fables and Blasphemous.
9:15 impossível
I AM SO GLAD YOU MENTIONED BUG FABLES THAT GAME IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE
we dont stan the block grr
Jeez.. redundant much?
DANDARA!!!!! VAI BRASIL 🇧🇷!!!!  As a Brasilian, I loved the mention of one of my favorite national games.  Edit: no way you mentioned Turma da Monica.
Two other references in Bug Fables to Hollow Knight: *In the Chomper Cave, digging into a crack in one of the walls of the cave (after getting the ability to use it) and following it to the other side will pop you into a room with an Old Nail dug into a rock in the cave. Interestingly, the nail is significantly bigger than Team Snakemouth, suggesting that the Bug Fables bugs are a lot smaller than the Hollow Knight bugs. Or that it's someone else's nail. *The Item Tracker badge, which you can get in the Bee Kingdom as a B.O.S.S. system reward, is the spitting image of The Knight's helmet. That's really the end of the references though.
If fall guys adds hollow knight I will actually play the game
Hear mossbag talk about turma da monica was not on the list of things i expected to hear today. But i am not complaining
Mossbag I think quirel would come back for a dlc fight just appear or in silk song hornet would go there and the sword would be gone
BUG FABLES PUBLICITY YEAHHHHH
this was the last video i expected to find Turma da Mônica lmao
A beer in russia is the straight referense to the hollow knight, its even called hollow knight, but in russian
I'm stuck on a loop and videos that link to each other, help!
Dude you know bout amphibia that my fav shoe
I am so mad at myself for not already knowing the Amphibia or Owl House references
SHAA
As a Brazilian, the last thing I expected was to find a Hollow Knight reference in Turma da Mônica
Australia Gaming
8:56 In Master Chef Italy they used Danganrompa V3 music with nonchalance so yeah ahah
do nada um turma da monica ali
7.54 its a pokemon . not a digimon
A couple days ago in my class in college, the teacher give us a video to watch about depression and other themes.  And, all the video had Hollow Kinght music
Glad to know Mossbag is based on central banking and MMT. End the Fed!
Or when shovel knight came into brawlhalla
7:36 there is also a Berserk reference
In the next one the intro says FARFUUNDA
Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes, the spin off game for the Nintendo Switch also features a Hollow Knight cameo. The main character, Travis Touchdown, can collect T-shirts in the game, with many of them referencing other media. One of those shirts features the Knight's iconic head shape.
7:53 THIS IS NOT A DIGIMON IS A POKEMON Edit: it was a joke
Lo de Amphibia lo sospechaba desde que vi el capitulo, PERO LO DE THE OWL HOUSE ESTABA MUY BIEN OCULTO, jente de cultura Matt Braly y Danna Terrace 😎
I hope Metorid Prime 4 or other future Metroid games reference Hollow Knight at some point.
Hollow knightverse confirmado
kakakakkakakak turma da Mônica mandou benzão nas referências, em qual edição aparece todas essas referências?
about your first statement: i 100% agree. tho i mostly loves crossovers, but references are still close to it in some ways
Also Epic Battle Fantasy 5 as an enemy/pet.
this video was nice but the only problem is how he spelt "Turma de Monica" as "Tourna de mounica" instead of "Turma da Monica" lol
There’s also a Nail from Hollowknight hidden in a cave in Bug Fables
There's one more reference that I know. In Blasphemous there's a secret room, in a tiny space were you have to dash to access to it, inside the room there's a bunch of frames, you can find; one with the knight, one of dead cells, one of shovel knight, and I think you can find one of earthbound.
When will we get full knight from half knight?
Oh. Right. I DEFINITELY wasn't expecting Turma da Monica to show up there
Omagus
Bro, monica and friends has a LOT of references like that. Maurício de Sousa, the writer, jus like to put references every where, from games, anime and tv shows. But HOLLOW KNIGHT was not in my list of expected things.
OH MY GOD IM GONNA DIE, BOTH OF MY FAV SHOWS HAD HOLLOW KNIGHT IN THEM AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
oh wow. its actually anninteresting video. thank you more reasons to finish Guacamelee and play more dead cells (come to russia? it would be cool and weird)
He saying "turma da monica" was so funny lmao
I LOVE THE BLOCK LOL
Mossbag switching sides on the intro really caught me this time XD
In our blood cells? Possible, actually. Sickle cell disease shapes your blood cells in such a way they could be drawn to resemble the knights horns
Бл, где взять крафтовое пиво Полый Рыцарь?
The blood disease known as sickle cell is a vague reference to hollow knight. It turns your blood into the hollow knight's head
This is basically a large ad
There is also a reference in "La Mulana 2" where one of the merchants IS Cornifer (the game has a bunch of references to other games as well!)
Have you thought about making Review of Hollow Knight? And can you make it 16 minutes or 20 minutes long.
I’ve been stuck in an infinite loop for two days. Please someone help me. PLEASE
TURMA DA MONICA WTFFF
Found another reference, I saw a nail in my basement, that beetle never stood a chance
Wow I had no idea hollow knight from the hit 2017 game Hollow knight was secretly ninja Fortnite
"there's that annoying ass penguin from digimon" Piplup, who is from pokemon: *ayo what the fu-*
You fool! 5e knight is already in my blood stream!
You forgot the terraria joost mod
Catch me making a hollow knight Easter egg in any future thing I do
Me as a Brazilian seeing that many references in a Turma Da Mônica Magazine I'm impressed and proud of it because it made my childhood.
Heck yeah grime! How did I not notice that reference in the game?
IS THAT A TURMA DA MÔNICA REFERENCE???? LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
LMAO, I'VE USED ICE NEEDLE FROM OSFE SO MANY TIMES, HOW DID I NOT NOTICE THAT
Oh in the outro I thought you asked if there were hollow knight references in hollow knight
I'm waiting until humans do the only and most obvious move and turn into crabs like everything else will
Hearing "it's not like other weapons because you can swing it upwards and downwards" gave me an unwarranted sense of joy
A hollow knight character cameod in my kitchen at 2 am yesterday.
I love how a video game song made its way into a tv show! I feel like game OST’s don’t get enough credit.
Your local Brazilian fan passing by, i would just like to say that your pronounciation or "turma da monica" was actually quite good
Ok you got me with digimon lmao
Annoying penguin from digimon? Lmao.
Never thought mossbag would comment about Turma da Mônica
Hollow knight in fortnite
The intro was very cringe
Or when shovel knight made it to brawlhalla
Hahaha mossbag tentando falar "Turma da Mônica" me quebrou
we gonna ignore this absolute masterpiece @previousvideo
The real Silksong were the friends we made a long the way.
I’d like to point out king is a demon
my blood fully consists of the knight from hollow knight, and some silksong news.
I am extremely confused how two of my favorite shows have a hollow knight reference in them and I DIDNT notice
I had no idea Hollow Knight was this influential
9:50 if only...
I don't usually but second comments on video but I can't believe there's a reference in forager AND ADVENTURE PALS adventure pals is one of my favourite games i also quite like forager and the amphibia reference is so good and smooth with putting the master sword and pure nail on the weapon wrack im dying of joy
You missed a reference, right above the Ohmu plushie is a plushie of Psycho Jenny from Devilman.
splitting one video into two to double the views. clever
Baby broken vessel 😊
or when shovel knight showed up in Just Shapes and Beats
BREAKING NEWS: Several vessels have been detected on Mars. This is not a joke. The vessels have broken several Mars rovers. Stay tuned for more ridiculous comments.
eu nunca pensei que precisaria escutar o mossbag falando turma da monica ate escutar ele falando turma da monica
you want cameos take a look at brawlhalla mfs got ben10 and wwe
I loved the subtle comment about unoriginality regarding Disney shows worldbuilding.
Never thought I'd hear Obi-wan Kenobi and Mace Windu come from mossbag.
Alá a turma da Mônica
In hollow knight, there is a bench
After that intro I feel like I've been tricked into watching a 21 minutes long convoluted joke in 2 parts
I love it here
I've seen a reference to Hornet in a game called Hollow Knight: Silksong.
dead cells is the 100 gecs of indie games
turma da monica
Turma da Mônica lfgggggg
Holy fuck I didn't expected to hear about Turma da Mônica outside Brazil lol
7:52 Mossbag says "There's that annoying-ass penguin from Digimon."  I have never been so spited and annoyed in my life.  Homie, that sassy penguin is Piplup from Pokemon Diamond and Pokemon Pearl.  It isn't even the right series.  Plus, I actually love Dawn's Piplup in the Diamond and Pearl show.  It added some great sass and pettiness to the franchise that made me laugh as a kid.  Edit: yes I know Mossbag is being sarcastic but still as a Pokemon fan it set me off lol.
One thing you missed was the rest spell in one step from eden.
Suddenly the idea of the knight in Smash is not so hard to believe. We even have a connection. The Knight apppears in those Disney shows, and Sora- a Disney character- is in Smash now.
One time I went to the Natural Science museum in my city and I could not believe what I saw. It was a fossil of the Knight., but his body has been cut off leaving only the head.
I'm trapped between this video, and the other cameo video--because the ends keep leading me to the other vid.  Pls set me free!
7:36 Mans just went over Femto like he was nothing 😭
Hilarious you start with the opposite of the start of the other video
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates . 🎈
or when shovel knight made it in brawlhalla. or when shovel knight made it in Rivals of Aether
moss you have placed me in a loop of constantly watching this video and the "hidden Easter eggs in hollow knight" video. I cant get out
Love the among us videos. Keep up the good work <3
This video is the Hollow Knight of refferences to other videos in this channel
poha turma da monica
My Favorite video Game are Halo, Hollow Knight, Metroid, Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2.
7:53 mhmm… Digimon.
you missed Epic battle fantasy 5 the game has a card name " hollow soldier" and it looks exactly like the knight
Caraca ele apareceu na turma da monica
Help, I've been in a loop between these 2 reference videos for a day now. They just keep appearing at the end of each video..
Calamity mod terraria :()
since when did piplup became a digimon?
In Hollow knight there is an elder bug from Hollow knight in the game
I did not expect there to be a hollow knight reference in Binding of Isaac, now I’m all giddy all of a sudden.
no mention of a t-posing guy? disliking
9:28 Реально? Не верю ...
mossbag: "The Owl House has a reference to Hollow Knight" Me: "I sleep" mossbag: "There's also a reference to the 4th angel from Neon Genesis Evangelion" Me: "SHUT UP I HAVE A NEW SHOW TO GO WATCH!"
waiy hol up the intro is the exact opposite of your other references video
I like how he gave The Owl House and Amphibia the same synopsis but u cant say he's wrong.
They used Hornet music in a Danish documentary about the Danish football team from 1992
That Russian beer is literally named 'Hollow knight'
When you brought up the bible, I thought you were going to talk about all the references to holow knight in there.
Funny how you missed more blatant Hollow Knight reference in Bug Tales - you can find actual nail in some cave. You can’t pick it up sadly
oh my godddd i had blocked that episode of the block from my memory lmao what a moment that was
The annoying ass penguin is from pokemon but somehow I feel like you said that on purpose
Hollow knight do be trending
Brazilians love hk too
I found a game called “Hungry Knight” They use the knight as a main character What a huge cameo
If Shovel Knight is the king of crossovers and cameos, then it could be nice to have the Knight as the prince.
A lot of Dark Souls players make references to Hornet when you talk about how hard the game is
That intro was so trippy i taught you changed the title of your previous video
i literally just started playing dead cells what
Nice intro
mossbag said the word "reference" which could be a reference to his previous video about references
i'm only here for the "turma da monica" cameo
s/o to the intro iykyk
One step from eden also has a "rest" card that features a very vessel looking character on a bench
This game called silksong that will come out in a few years has a few discreet references to hollow knight, but you really need to be a big fan to see them
4:51 "Which means we can now connect Hollow Knight to Fortnite." IS NOTHING SACRED???
I KNEW YOU WOULD MENTION AMPHIBIA AND THE OWL HOUSE LETS GOOOOOOOOO
To the person reading this comment You are awesome & hope you are having a great day  My dream is to hit 1k I hope you can help me accomplish my dreams  PS: I'm not a bot, and only comment if i have watched the entire video start to finish!
There's also a Hollow Knight nail hidden in Bug Fables next to an almost white flower
6:03 HOLY FUCK I REMEMBER THE FLASH GAME, it was really fucking good for no reason i'm so glad they made it a fully fleshed out thing
I started to get giddy when I heard amphibia and the howl house.
And the knight is everywhere u can’t not escape form hom
We Gorbbed him everyone
Did you know that the grass you can find on people's lawns in real life is actually a reference to the grass found in Greenpath in Hollow Knight?
Out of all of the part his are nothing you know you hit a new low when is so cool
Haven't played Hollow Knight, but judging by the comments, I like this fan base
Holy shit I think my brain has a Hollow Knight reference
Why The Knight in other medias make me cry?
Hmm
I remember seeing the game like 4 years ago. Now I see it every 10 minutes.
IS THAT MIKE THE KNIGHT
SHAA
Just feels like hutt’s games😂
AOOOOOOOOO TURMA DA MONICA MAURÍCIO DE SOUZA CARAIOOOOO
I was hoping you'd make something like this.
man i'm brazilian, and grow up with turma da monica, really cool to see it in this video.
I actually heard the music more times allreay... no, I o not remember where it was...
Hot take: The Godmaster ending symbolized the game's influence on the real world, the collective mind of the audience being won over, and eventually taken by the Knight and their inexplicably vast stage presence
Bug fables, The binding of isaac, FREAKING ADVENTURE PALS?! ALL OF THE GAMES I PLAY LETS GOO
How in the hell did I miss a dead cells update
i got it right or at 9:13 its a HOLY SHIT MOTHERFUCKING TURMA DA MONICA REFERECE????
lmao watching the intro right after the other video was great
Why did you remind me Rick & Morty are in Space Jam 2? :(
I think there's another reference to Hollow Knight in Bug Fables. If you dig under a crack in the wall in the Chomper Nest, you'll find a hidden cave with the Berserker medal in it. There's also what seems to be a large nail, embedded in the corner of the room.  Honestly, I could easily see Hollow Knight and Bug Fables existing in the same universe. Barring the obvious "world of bugs" similarites. The further you get from Bugaria, the more dead and savage the world becomes, with more and more feral, mindless creatures and abominations. It's also said the crystals are what give Bugaria it's more mystical properties, and it's implied that they not only gave bugs their sentience, but that an utterly massive crystal is buried deep under the kingdom. It's what keeps the little patch of land green and healthy while the rest of the world is ashen, misty, and savage. I could easily see Hallownest existing out in the wastes somewhere without a Mother Crystal, needing deities to intervene instead.
A Hollow Knight Easter egg that you missed was pretty surprising to me. There is this game called Hollow Knight that has such a huge reference to the game Hollow Knight that it actually plays exactly like Hollow Knight for the entirety of the game.
4:42
mossbag opinion ULTRAKILL? go:
Omg Turma da Mônica is FULL of reference pages like those you guys had to see the one where Master Chief hits on Chun-li
you forgot the pale king from james bond spectre
There is a reference to Hollow Knight in the metroidvania game,Hollow Knight
Can't believe you didn't mention when shovel knight made it into brawlhalla
trending nice
Omg I might be wrong but I think under the master sword is the dawnbreaker from Skyrim
Amphibia cameo
Time for me to make one of my favorite jokes…    Is that a hollow knight reference?
ha the way you point out how indistinguishable disneys shows are nowadays was delectable
I love how unnecessarily sassy these videos are 👌
Wow trending
This isn't even the only Hollow Knight reference in Bug Fables ;)
Mossbag: *google "hollow knight reference"* Mossbag: oh my god there so much stuff, it will make twice as long just to find what relates to the vido Mossbag:... unless i make two videos at the same time
In the reanimated music "shiny" from Moana
2 mossbag vids a day makes my hollow go away!
9:44 or on the moon    **shows saturn**
Ah, yes, *Girlfriend, the start item*
I was expecting a Ori Will of the Whisps joke. I am disappointed....
(btw, shovel knight also got into For Honor, just so you know.)
For those wondering, you can find the HK craft beer at Thicket Brewery in Moscow.
I learned how to read with the turma da Mônica comics, it's so nice to know that hollow knight is so popular that it got there. The green elephant name is Jotalhão and the Galdanf reference is super cool because Jotalhão use to protect and teach them about nature.
Wait, did i arrive on an alternate universe?
9:28 Lol, It's the first time I see it, considering that I'm Russian, and I'm. a huge fan of Hollow Knight.
Ah yes, my favorite FICTIONAL character, Ninja.
Te amo, mossbag. Gracias a ti conocí Hollow Knight.
46th on trending : 0
In stoneblock 2 - a popular modpack for Minecraft, a quest for getting dirt id called Dirtmouth xD
Another hollow knight reference is in Dead Cells, added before the update. In the Ancient Sewers, there is some graffiti in a certain room, it says Git Gud
i did NOT expect Turma da Monica to be in here bro
I’ve been in a loop between these two videos help for the past few days help.
Something that looks a lot like the knight’s mask appears in the last episode of castlevania season 4
3:38 made me laugh, that was pretty funny-
Maybe the real Hollow Knight was the friends we made along the way XD
Hollow Knight has crossed over with Binding of Isaac which has crossed over with Among Us which has crossed over with League of Legends which has crossed over with Fortnite which has crossed over with Dune. So congratulations Team Cherry, your game is canon in the Dune universe.
there’s another reference to hollow knight in bug fables, in which there is a secret area with an object that bears a strong resemblance to the knight’s nail
Oof Damn, this video was made so long ago ...
Nunca imaginei ver uma foto de um gibi da turma da mônica nesse canal
A community-made cube of The Knight is speculated to appear in Geometry Dash 2.2 due to a low-res image of all 2.2 cubes released by the game's developer, RobTop. Several community members (including the creator of the Knight cube, RetroAdvance64) have figured out some potential cubes coming in the update from that image, and the Knight cube is one of them.
Someone help, I’ve been caught bouncing back and forth between two Hollow Knight Reference videos for the past 24 hours and I can’t make myself stop
4:22 is this a spelunky reference?
An obscure peice of literature known as the Bible, understatement of the millennia, also I would be cool if you dove into Dead cell's lore as it has a pretty deep story. God Bless and happy Thanksgiving to all Americans.
Shovel knight lfg
:skull:
My brother literally plays all of the games in the new dead cels update lol.
7:52 Minor Correction here mossbag:   This penguin is actually from the rather well-known Digimon ripoff. I believe it’s called Yokai Watch.
7:52 made me laugh so hard
Just noticed, in the owl house it's actually a small version of the hollow knight, rather than the knight we play as. It's got the different horns
Fucking turma da Monica that is crazy
9:13 Brazilians: *QUEM OUSA NOS INVOCAR ?!*
You actualy missed a refference in Bug Fables. In the sub area "The Chomper Cave", to the far left you find a crack in the wall, use Kabbu's overworld "Dig" ability and go into the crack. You'll find a small secret room with the "Berserker" medal, and to the right of the medal, a nail, looking almost exactly like the one the knight held.
Krl, turma da monica.
4:34
Recursive function, musst watch both videos.
It should be "shawn"...
я гора
Not only that craft beer can has a silouette of a hollow knight mask on it, but it is also literally called "Hollow knight" in Russian ;)
9:30 absolutely true, man
if you want to count this too, i made a secret trainer called "Cherry" that have 4 "pokemon", The Knight, Elderbug, Myla and naturally Zote P.S: i haven't mentioned that i'm working on a pokemon hack rom for a streamer
LOL your jokes are in high gear here.
The giraffe in The Owl House is a reference to a joke in the show itself
you forgot to mention the one Binding of Issac card that fucking Chris Chan made and yes, apparently it made it in
Help, I'm stuck in a loop because these videos are linking each other
Was waiting for the block one, parents were very confused when I asked them to rewind for video game music.
oh my god, when you said turma da monica, i spent MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD reading it and i didnt realized.
00:39 Or when Shovel Knight made it into Just Shapes and Beats.  I couldn't make this up if I wanted to.
Woah, cool, this got #12 on trending
Actually, moths in real life are a reference to Radiance and the moths from Hollow Knight  You´re welcome
There is a item called shade in tboi that looks similar to the shade in hk
Wait a moment you love...
Damn I can't believe this video became outdated literally like 10 hours after you uploaded it. Feelsbadman.  (Hollow Knight got added to Dead Cells)
Congratulations on getting on trending twice!
Isn’t it a big deal that this is trending on YouTube?
I've been stuck in a loop going between the two videos for 10 hours how do I stop
By the way, turma da monica is a children's comic made by a really, really old dude, and, either, the man is keeping up with the world, or someone introduzed HK to him, now I don't know which one scares me the most
Did…. Did you call Mars the moon?
Hollow knight should be in Bugsnax!
I love how Hollow Knight has just wormed its way into the hearts of so many creators and fans that they just can't help but pay homage to the game. It really speaks to the great impact this game has had.
If the binding of Isaac has a hollow knight reference then we can actually connect hollow knight with the holy bible.
The Block is also a reference to Minecraft, a game with blocks
im sorry but if shovel knight faced the vessel in a fight he would take the W, like, he defeated kratos cannonically, and tecnically the knight is on the same level since yknow, big god moth event, and he does have the troupple on his side so he would win
I literally burst out laughing at the intro having just watched the Hollow Knight video that links here. Very well done.
When is this new update for dead cells coming out
9:27 РУССКИЕ ВПЕРЁД!  We are also waiting for silksong!
"I love references"
Four souls also has the golden idol from spelunky
You should check out the Steam version of Rivals of Aether. With Steam Workshop content several players have been making their own characters and stages. There are three Hollow Knight stages on the Workshop based off Greenpath, City of Tears and The White Palace and a really robust Knight that plays exactly like he does in Hollow Knight. There's also a Hornet that's in ongoing development. So if you ever want to play as the Knight in a fighting game this is probably your best chance. And hey, Shovel Knight is a part of that game's roster so if you wanted you could have a fight between The Knight and Shovel Knight!
I am brazilian and Turma da Mônica is hiper famous around here, basically every old or young person knows or already read this comic. I never saw that reference from Hollow Knight but I am glad you show me, now I can die in peace.
Help me!! I am stuck in a loop between the two videos!!
In the Owl House intro the giraffe plushie is featured because there’s an ongoing gag in the show that Giraffes are actually from the demon realm (the “magical world” the protagonist stumbles into) but now live in the human realm for some reason.
I can even think of 2 more. The game "Tails of Iron" has a hidden statue of the knight with a full set of gear, helmet, cloak and nail & the game "cake bash" has a reference in it's collection, where the name of the great white butterfly decoration is >the Radiance< and the description reads: Gaze into the light and hear a distant choir.
I dunno if there's an American counterpart of it (most likely), but in French, there's an show calls "Le Meilleur Pâtissier" ("The Best Baker" literally, I guess ?), airing each year around Mid-October through November. And each year, there's the well-known Halloween episode ... I let you guess which music they seem to love using at least one time in these specials. Yes, you guessed right : *Dora the Explorer, the Video Ga-* wait, no. Grimm's battle theme (and sometimes the Mantis Lords'). But it's not the first time they did it anyway. Just wanted to point it out :)
ELE FALOU DE TURMA DA MONICA GENTE LETS GOOOOOOO
How is this not a dunkey video
Man, Amphibia and the Owl House sound like Disney made a formula and are sticking to it like molasses.
Wait, I'm confused 😅
The card bottom right is the Chinese name of Hollow knight. 虛空騎士/虚空骑士
Previous video: "I hate references. I hate how Wario appeared in SNL" This video: "I love references. I love how Wario appeared in SNL"
mossbag on trending babieeeeeeeeeeeeee
I'VE BEEN WATCHING AMPHIBIA AND DIDN'T NOTICE THE NAIL LOL
A lesser known reference to hollow knight can be found in the game hollow knight this Easter egg can be found by plaing the game
8:40 Okay I have a story for this one... In my country, we have a show called "Scènes de Ménage", which a show about comedic cpuple-scenes in the form of skits... And one day, they used Mettaton's theme from Undertale, or more precisely the Mad Dummy kind of part. Same way, music use is allowed as long as it doesn't go beyond reason, and it was less than 6-7 seconds so I guess it's okay
Props to Team Cherry for first popularizing the bench so now we all have a place to sit.
There a silk song reference in deadcell too, a fire camp with a long needle and the obscure writing “get gud!”
PLAY BUG FABLES PLAY BUG FABLES PLAY BUG FABLES 😳
the intro is the exact oppisite to what you said in the in last video
BRUH THERE'S ALSO A PLUSHIE OF THE KNIGHT FROM BERSERK IN THE OWLHOUSE OPENING
Hollowknight is everywhere. In our dreams. In our daymares. In our nightmares. You can't escape the references. Just like Fortnite kirby style snatching your favorite series.
But I hate references
"Out of all the games were Hollow Knight could make a cameo, Fallguys makes the most sense" you have no heart
In France I recently heard Grimm and the mantis boss fight songs used in a TV show called "the best pastry chef" And there's a small French rapper that used the main theme in his music called "mauvais payeur" check it out!
“The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.” ‭‭2 Peter‬ ‭3:9‬ ‭NIV‬  ROMANS 10:9-11 “If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame”    “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.” ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭11:28‬ ‭       “For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”” ‭‭Luke‬ ‭19:10‬ ‭  God wants us to believe in His One and Only Son, Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior, who died for our sins :D When we truly believe in our hearts that Jesus is the Son of God, who died for our sins so we could have eternal life with God, we are saved from the eternal fire and have eternal life in Christ Jesus!! 💖 May God bless y’all!!
I love the references and the parallel between the two videos mossbag uploaded at the same time
Maybe the real Hollow Knight was the friends we made along the way XD
Thank you mossbag for telling us this I'm a huge fan of hollow knight I play some games that had hollow knight reference but I need more lore
"I wouldn't be surprised if the Knight ended up in our bloodcells."  aM HUMANS MADE OF VOID??????
Russian Hollow Knight beer: Makes you invincible against the spikes. Blurs the screen. Makes it harder to see everything. Fills your soul Usage time: 10 minutes
If we start finding the Knight in our blood, does that mean we're void?
Actually, mossbag, you missed what's quite possibly the biggest Hollow Knight reference ever! The characacter named "Sans" from the indie game "Deltarune" was modeled after the Dashmaster charm from Hollow Knight!
A few days ago, I was listening to Deutschlandfunk, an german News and Culture Channel.  There was a review from a guy who played in a theater role alongside an dog and he described how the dog played his role pretty well.  In this review they used the Dogsong from Undertale as background Music, which I found pretty funny. It's not Hollow Knigth, but i was an pretty funny surprise nontheless.
9:12 IS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING BRAZILLIAN REFERENCE!?!?!?  Jokes aside, that was really unexpected lmao
i think the knight's nail is also hidden in bug fables
#12 on trending??? loool
The moment when shovel knight made it into shovel knight was absolute epic
Another reference, there is also a Hollow Knight T-shirt for the main character in No More Heroes: Travis Strikes Back!
I honestly didn’t expect the hollow knight theme to be in the block…
At 8:03 you can see Griffin in his helmet from Berserk
COVID 19 IS ALL KNOWN,  AND ALL PLANNED FOR ECONOMIC RESET. THIS IS BIBLE PROPHECY IN THE MAKING. THE TIME WILL COME YOU WILL BE FORCED TO TAKE THE MARK IN ORDER TO BUY OR SELL. NEVER TAKE. IF YOU TAKE YOU WILL REGRET IT. CAN;T BE UNDONE. SEEK JESUS CHRIST WITH ALL YOUR HEART.........
HELP!! I've been stuck in this loop. Everytime the video ends I click the next one. I'VE WATCHED THESE VIDEOS 10 TIMES Im stuck in a hollow knight prison (could be worse tbh)
There is a secret room in Bug Fables that also has a Hollow Knight Reference, with a nail sticking out of the ground
I love the refence to the "hidden easter eggs in hollow knight" video in this video. Pretty hard to spot, but the homage is immaculate and really captures the style of the video creator.
4:54 how. dare. you.
The moment when shovel knight made it into shovel knight was absolute epic
As an Australian, I can confirm that the block is actually filmed in the only city here with only 400 houses, they simply destroy the houses and rebuild them each season.
Hey, I from Russia and i didn't even know about that beer! Anyway, thanks for your videos, and i hope you'll visit Russia someday and we will drink together Hollow Knight beer ;)
Honestly I’m surprised that Enter the Gungeon did not reference Hollow Knight in any item, given the ammount of direct references in this game.
the intros from the last video to this one gave me whiplash, thanks
The more Hollow Knight references I witness, the more obsessed I become with Silksong.
He really just uploaded 2 videos just to throw us off...
Mossbag: i love references  Me who wasn't going to fill my indie game with them anymore: '_'
I remember a skin of hollow knight in the game "reventure", and, just like this one, it's interesting to think how your knowledge of hollow knight references is highly associated with the amount of media you consume, he is everywhere, and with reason, such a good game, but at the end, knowing all the references seems to be out of our capabilities, and some of the deeper inspirations and feelings of the game-creators will remain just for themselfs
9:44 sickle cell anemia causes red blood cells to form a sickle shape, similar to that of the knight's horns. I believe this is our genes making a hollow knight reference.
What
I'm honestly surprised that not one, but TWO modern Disney shows referenced hollow knight. I thought modern Disney had no taste.
who reads this, be happy and healthy)
Really just want to to shout out Dandara and Grime if you havent played them, they are amazing titles
Epic Battle Fantasy 5 has a hollow knight reference with a card called hollow soldier
mossbag finally discussed the minor indie game among us
Is this video and it’s counterpart in itself a reference to Dunkey’s Pokémon let’s go counter part video. My only evidence is the beginning of this video being reminiscent, and the fact that Mossbag is a confirmed fan of Dunkey
Great openings for both the videos.
Crying minotaur in fall guys looks a bit like hollow knigth but might be just different enough to not be it?
Using the Hollowknight song in The Block!?  I once heard 9 News use Undertale Sans music before.
ah yes the duality of mossbag
Speedrun. Time.          This says a lot about our society Mogus Doguns Badongus Boobas :0 intensifies Also I still don't jnow wtf "cameo" means I need more english knowledge Adios
I enjoyed the subtle Disney tv show roast.
If the Knight is in our blood cell, then does it mean we are made out of void
I just realized I've been enjoying ur vids for the past two weeks and haven't subscribed yet. Just clicked that button today!! I'm so sorry Mossbag!
Omg. There is a Psycho Jenny plush in King's mound of stuffed animals. I never noticed that, and thats a weird inspiration
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
I can’t believe I never caught those references in the owl house/amphibia, that’s awesome
I've just been playing through Bug Fables and then I decided to watch this.  Huh
Given recent developments I'm expecting Bluey to have a hollow knight refference soon.
Australia is as dangerous as Hallownest so they get a pass to play Hollow Knight music.
mossbag sent me here
I just remembered that there is a few hollow knight references in this super obscure game called: Hollow Knight
Being one of the seven Australians, I love hearing all your funny, “true” facts about Australia.
shaw
The binding of Isaac also has an item called shade
"I hate references" -mossbag
Anyone notice Psycho Jenny beside the angel?
Its always a good day when Mossbag double uploads
#12 on trending??
Also, elden ring referenced hollow knight's sequel 'Silksong' up until recently, by not existing, altough the recent closed network test has put a stop to this long running reference
This could just be a coincidence but the detector badge in bug fables has a resemblance to the knight.
In the Game "Reventure" you can obtain a skin of the Knight
5:13 'fall guys makes the most sense' shows the knight fucking falling I love it
most effective vaccine, plug the night straight into your bloodstream so they can fight viruses
Does any1 else remember a dif intro captions that hated references??? Am i just crazy???
I can't handle just seeing The Block show up on this list. Also the Australian copyright laws make it way easier to understand why there was Sans' theme music and Dream's "Mask" playing in news reports.
clever intro jokes between videos, I was almost missed it.
Hollow Knight's nail is also in a hidden room in bug fables
#12 on trending
Help me I'm stuck in a loop of watching both videos I can't stop clicking the video that appears at the end
Don’t forget the shovel knight reverence in just shapes and beats
OH NO THE VIDEOS ARE AN INFINITE LOOP
"The annoying penguin from digimon"😂😂  Me knowing what pokemon that is😅
pog double upload
8:09 what the fuck?
Congrats on trending man !’n
Nice job on getting on trending!
Yo Shovel Knight was in Shovel Knight?! I thought that was Big Spoon Knight!
I am convinced that Silksong has secretly been finished, and is now hidden as an easter egg in another indie game. We just need to find it!
youre fucking with me, right?
no way Bug Fables real
I played bug fables, but I never picked up on the reference. Also, play bug fables.
Interestingly enough, that show The Block regularly uses music from The Sims 3 lol
"SHAA!" I fukin' died!
I’m stuck in an infinite loop
14th on yt trending W
would be cool if u do content about dead cells r other games tho.
there is actually another hollow knight reference in bug fables , after hearing the moth speak gibberish , kabbu asks if he is one of the "fabled underground tribe"
This channel is too good. When silksong come out we will be good with content for the next 2 decades!
since naruto is now on fortnite, do that mean hollow knight is referenced in naruto too? 👀
I watched this YouTube video, then same night played a random game, PHOGS, and there was a hollow knight reference I swear. You’re in a “dream” level and theres a symbol everywhere that looks like the resting grounds sigil plus a character that looks like the seer!
Im brazilian and grew up reading turma da Mônica. They always do some crazy references to pop culture, but to see the knight in one of the comics is always astonishing to me lol
Lol o cara falou de turma da monica mesmo kakakakak
We need a hollow knight anime
SHAA
no
Shovel
There’s this game coming out in the future that’s all about Hollow Knight references, surprised you didn’t talk about it.
TURMA DA MÔNICA E DANDARA!!! My brazilian underdog syndrome tingles to raise my serotonin levels
Yooo how is this trending so high
WOO
The fact that he double uploaded with exactly opposite takes on references in both videos is comedic gold
caralho do nada a turma da Mônica no video do gringo kkkkkk
“The annoying penguin from digimon” lmao it’s from Pokémon
I think it needs to be asked, mossbag, are you okay? Its been a while sinse you've been waiting for silksong, dont you want to- idk, maybe go outside? No, i think thats too much to ask, open the window? Maybe?
The intro gave me whiplash, good job moss
i just watched it and now its a completely different title and thumbnail and intro wtf???? am i fucking crazy
what the FUCK happened in this video
It's a shame that the late game fights of Hollow Knight are pain. Another issue I have is that the movement feels sluggish, which is an issue I did not encounter when playing Ori and the Will of the Wisps. Luckily, Silksong looks to have the aspects I love about both its predecessor and Ori 2!
Hollow Knight Beer.
I did not expect to ever see the block on this channel, but I do remember freaking out when I heard the music on the show
trendingggg
He did it He said Among us
Ok the opposing intros were great
I was so surprised by the idea of getting two uploads in the same hour that I thought this video was the same as the previous, just with a changed title and thumbnail
mossbag saying neon genisis evangelion is not somthing i thought would make me luagh.
I am shocked and appalled that you didn't mention the Berserk reference in the Owl House opening after you mentioned Berserk in the other video.
Help. I'm caught in a loop! If I go much longer, I might just become a Hollow Knight reference!
The fact that the gf in the binding of Isaac card game is an item card... Tryin to say somethin edd?
Why .5?
Ah yes. I want little Knight running in my blood vessels.
2 mossbag videos? Christmas came early
Trick question, the knight is already in Mossbag's blood cells
Jesus is coming soon!  Repent and believe the gospel:  Christ died for your sins, was buried, and rose again the third day, according to the scriptures.  He is the only way to Heaven.  He alone can save you from your sins and eternal torment in hell!  He loves you and doesn't wish that any should perish.  Time is running out; please believe on Jesus.
Love the reference of snl that is a reference to the previous video.
I've heard Saints Row menu music multiple times on chopped, music rights can be weird.
i love the way mossbag pronounced Turma da Mônica loool (brazilian fan here, i used to love that comic book as kid, its famous for doing those sort of references)
I thought I clicked on the wrong video for a second
I was really hoping you'd start this video with "I love references." You did not disappointed
This is unjust. You should not have hit the 10 minute mark.
The most epic part was realizing that he made two videos about the same stuff but they start with I hate references and then switch to I love references
omg. i'm stuck in an infinite loop between these two videos!!! YOU CRAFTY GENIUS!
In 7:37 literally Femtom in the right bottom corner, god dam
PETITION TO GET THE KNIGHT ON THE MOON
Ice needle = S H A A
I have already seen a french TV show episode where the music played in the background was Bowser's Galaxy Generator from Super Mario Galaxy 2. Not even joking, I wish I find this episode again that was kind of funny.
BRAZIL MENTIONED
BRAZIL MENTIONED!
Shaa or Shaw
Do you think theres a reference to hollow knight in the hit game hollow knight?
how tf do you have 2 videos on trending?
I had actually started playing Bug Fables last week. Can't wait to reach the reference!
7:52 How to make deep fried Pokemon fan turkey in one simple step!
Kind of incredible to know out of all the games, an indie game by 3 guys has the fame to be in a Disney show with a subtle reference right next to a Zelda one.
Finally I can drink hollow knight
I just realized Hollow Knight was released in 2017. Wow it was that old.
Didn’t watched to the end yet, but Internet Historian used hornet song in his cost of concordia video
oh my gosh 3rd video in a spawn of 2 weeks and 2 of which at the same time 0.o  what happened to 1 upload every 3 months  keep up the good work :-)
I had no idea four souls requiem had this many crossover cards!
8:36 ayo wtf 🤣🤣🤣
Holy shit! I didn't know about the Bible reference in The Binding of Isaac! 👁️👄👁️
Team Cherry look what you've done to this man
Imagine playing deadcells on mobile with the pure nail.
A possible cameo that isn't the Knight: In Chicory: A Colorful Tale, a smiling mushroom drawing can be found in the bug kingdom of Feast.  According to the devs, Team Cherry backed the Kickstarter for the game (this is visible in the credits) and included the drawing, so the devs placed it in the game's bug kingdom as a nod to Hollow Knight.  Maybe it's Mister Mushroom?  Unfortunately, the only source for that is the devs commenting on a livestream, so I don't know how solid that is.
cannot believe mossbag would say that's the fourth angel. It's so obviously the third angel, i mean c'mon, it's literally the first one we see in the show!
8:08 IT'S SO CUTE AAAHHHH
Sorry but Idk how the Knight appearing in Fall Guys makes a lot of sense. It sounds nice but I don't really play royales at all
Help, I'm stuck in an endless cycle of clicking the video link at the center of the end of both videos.
Hmph, people have it all wrong. The knight in Hollow knight is actually a Hungry Knight cameo! Therefore these are all Hungry Knight cameos
the moment when mossbag talks about every brazilian's favorite kids comic has finally arrived, turma da monica will dominate the world someday
BRASIL MENTIONED
That's a surprise, i would have thought that somewhat obscure continent would have been South America, but i stand corrected
I was not expecting a HK reference in Amphibia...
You missed the reference of the Knight being in the hit game Hollow Knight
The french version of The Great British Bake-off (Le Meilleur Pâtissier) used both Grimm’s and the 3 mantis lords’ themes their Halloween special two weeks ago
Wtf the Block? Used to watch that show all the time
I didn't know an Ohm was in the opening of Owl House, or a stuffed tbh
mossbag in the first video: I hate crossovers  mossbag now: I love crossovers
7:36 so were not gonna talk about griffith on the keyboard?
I have a sense of Deja Vu watching this video and I wonder why...
Holy shit, that beer from Russia does actually say “Полый Рыцарь” (Hollow Knight) on it. Very cool!
So i'm sitting here since 3 hours watching the recommended video at the end and I kind of get the impression that I'm watching the same 2 videos over and over!
The Hollow Knight to Fortnite connection just got shorter, as the Beheaded from Dead Cells is also a Fall Guys skin. That cuts it to just two pieces of media between HK and Fortnite
Wait… mossbag is an anime fan?!
WAIT HOLY SHT TURMA DA MÔNICA?? PROPS TO THE PERSON IN THE STUDIO WHO SNUCK THAT IN LMAO-  Pls i need to know wich comic was that i need it now. My childhood shall finally meet my current favorite medias.
Recreum
Excellent music choice at the beginning of the Dead Cells part, Fractured Shrines is a banger
is this a hollowknight reference
TURMA DA MÔNICA VAMO LÁ BRASIIIIIIL
7:36 in this shot there's also a reference to Devilman with a plush that looks like Psycho Jenny around the middle slightly to the left side.
Help, I can't escape the outro loop. I can't I, I cant I Ii iiii ii....
The duality of man
This intro seems familiar somehow
I know I'm late as I only beat the game for the first time last month but I had no idea it's already had that much of an impact on people.
I love the cinematic parallels between this video and the other
Huh
Secretly, all of these references were in regards to Team Cherry's Hungry Knight, instead.
The Ice Needle reference has to be my favorite. What a perfect way to do a reference- quick, subtle, and hilarious.
Team cherry: *doesn't release any news for months* mossbag: Did you know in a house flipper TV show in Australia, there's music from the game?
When I went outside today I saw a bug and realized that it was actually a Hollow Knight reference!
Mossbag watches jreg I think
or when shovel knight got into rivals of aether
I love how the intro is literally the inverse on his other video.
There's actually a hollow knight reference in my garage. Yesterday I found a nail on top of my fridge, I think Team Cherry put it there.
Still in beta but in the MMORPG Wakfu there's a new area coming directly inspired from HK !
9:15 - Suddenly CARALHO!
"more importantly"
SALVE DA TURMA DA MONICA
2:23 i really wish they atleast put the mask on the beheaded, i mean come on hes got a skull for the skul skin
You forgot when shovel knight got into just Shapes & Beats
I don't know if you've ever heard of it, but there's this SUPER obscure indie game called Hollow Knight, and I'm pretty sure that if you beat a super hard game mode, you get a golden statue of Zote, which is a pretty funny reference imo.  also, in the aforementioned literary work known as the Bible, a character known as Canaan steals Shem's land inheritance, which is clearly story bits stolen from Hollow Knight.
There's two more Hollowknight references within Bugfables, the first is a badge that resembles the Knight's head/shell thing, and the second is within the chomper cave, you can dig to a secret room containing a badge and nail within it.
I was playing hollowed knight and near the end I realized I forgot to save zote, and when I got there he was dead, I laughed so hard I fell out my chair
Bro this was such a hot scoop
i have the feeling you wanted to make a video like this but couldnt because hollow knight wasnt relevant enough again untill the new dead cells update
MOSSBAG REFERENCED TURMA DA MONICA  LESGOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Tierzoo also uses hollow knight music sometimes in his videos. That's my favorite crossover (:
I watch this video second and the intro is pretty well done, I must admit.
I believe the video game series Dark Souls contains a reference to Hollow Knight in its death mechanic. In those games, once you die, you have to go back to where you were killed to retrieve your currency, much like how you have to defeat your shade to get your Geo back in Hollow Knight. It's somewhat of an obscure reference, so I'm not surprised you overlooked it.
Two videos in one day?!
I swear his unchanging tone, combined with half the stuff he says making me go "no fucking way." makes me think this whole video is a very elaborate joke
Bruh the house TV show thing is like ABC news using Sans's theme
As an Australian I can confirm we have houses, lots of houses... But never did I know that they played a Hollow Knight song on the block.
🇧🇷 Iae mano. Eu sei q tu é brasileiro e levou um susto quando viu a turma da Monica. Aq está o comentário de outro brasileiro.
Girl what is this video
ESTOU EM CHOQUE COM O CROSSOVER COM TURMA DA MÔNICA.
boy oh boy, turma da monica has many two page spreads with references, like a lot of these, very interesting thar hollow knight of all things would apear in one of those, that green elephant guy is called jotalhão that also is a tomato sauce brand mascot, have no idea why
9:27 This beer is actually from a neat place in Saint Petersburg (no, not in Florida) called "Uncanon". They are littered with references, it being, like, there whole thing. They recently made a craft beer centered on Loki from the new show
Any Bug Fables recognition is good! Go play the game now!
I’m glad that Dead Cells is (hopefully) getting more attention
this video is a somewhat obscure refrence to hollow knight, for those wondering
the tv show using HK music reminds me of that one abc news australia video using sans theme
Carai menó nem sabia
Ah yes I  love 13.5 lists aren't they great.
did you know in the game hollow knight there is a character called hornet and hornets are bugs so i think that its a hollow knight reference
My mother used to ask me if I was going to play "the padlock" sometimes, so I guess we can now also call padlocks an obscure hollow knight reference :D
Ouroboros
I love how he says he loves wario in snl and rick and morty in space jam in this video and in the other video he says he hates both of them nice reference to your reference of a reference
9:27 Russian Hollow Beer: "No liquid to drink. No flavor to feel. No piss to piss."
One step from eden also references hollow knight with another card,  called "Rest" or something like that. It heals you by staying in place for a moment and the art looks a bit like the knight lying on a bench
Alright, that is incredibly obscure reference, but I have to mention it.  In quite popular Dark Souls 3 mod called cinders, there's a snail shell helmet which increases the player's FP ( Mana ) when worn. It's description goes:  "A helm fashioned from the shell of a snail.  The snails of the Undead Settlement are noted for their connection to the arcane and mystical."
You missed the dung defender cameo on The Late Show
BRAZIL MENTIONED  TURMA DA MONICA FOREVER MEU BOOOOM!!!
You can wear a Hollow Knight T-shirt in Travis Strikes again: No More Heroes. But you can also find some other t-shirts with other references like Hyperlight Drifter and Blasphemous.
I cant wait till mossbags next video where he injects hollow knight into his bloodstream
you should've called these videos "Hollow Knight References: Blue Version" and "Hollow Knight References: Red Version"
Help. I have been watching these videos for hours now, I’ve seen each at least 20 times. They keep linking me to the other one and I keep watching it. What should I do? Please advise!
The Knight is actually a reference to our white blood cells that defend our immune system.
9:15 BRAZIL HERE BABY
It's crazy that this video makes the same joke about the Holy Bible and Among Us
Can't believe you didn't mention the time shovel knight became God of War canon
*Obligatory play Bugfables shilling even though mossbag already told you to*
I think the owl house had another hollow knight reference where u can see the ghost plush clearly in one of the episodes
I'm sorry but please can you comment a link to the binding of isaac card game if you can. thanks
Is that the dawnstar sword from skyrim @7:03?
Don't forget "Shovel Knight in Bloodstained"
just went to mars, first thing i saw was a hollow knight reference
mossbag i’ve been stuck watching the same two videos that you linked for 5.7 hours because you told me to click the end cards help
In terraria alchemist NPC mod you have a knight vanity mask and a whole weapon line of all the nails
amphibia is owl house + frog
Game gear
Word had it Silksong may contain a reference to Hollow Knight. Seems doubtful, but one can hope.
:)
DISLIKE!!! How can you miss the Berserk reference?
I love the paraler 1st joke in both videos, great job!
I'm sorry, but you missed one more obscure one. There's this game called Silksong coming out, and if you look really closely at the trailers for the game you can see that beloved Hollow Knight character Hornet appears in it. To what extent it's not made clear yet. Probably just another background character.
This is the greatest channel in history
The block one reminded me of when a news station used sans. as a background song once
Best reference in hollow knight is the coop baby that looks like Slabfish from that one minecraft mod
Oh you didn't say what was the third sword, under the nail and the master sword. I wanted to know =(
Went into school one day, and one of the art projects that a class did was on a wall. They were what seemed to be clay masks that depicted some sort of monster. There was one that stood out though.... Someone made The Knight, and it was deemed good enough to be shown on the wall. To this day I still don't know who this legend is, but godspeed to that man.
I found another reference In the upcoming game set to release in 2069 Silksong, hornet from Hollow knight actually makes an appearance
wtf im brazilian and i never heard of this reference in turma da mônica... man i read this comic my whole life
4:18 This may be a nod to a very small manga known as Jojo's Bizzare Adventure
the duality of the intros of the references in hollow knight lol
Honestly, describing King as "this dog thing" is entirely accurate
"I love references."  ...wait a minute
*LMFAO THE INTRO- I HATE YOU SO MUCH, THIS IS NEXT LEVEL*
you can call it "Monica's gang". And yes, the author is obcessed with refferences
Breh two vids in a day. Silksong is near
Here in Brazil we Love Hollow knight!
Bro said the exact opposite of the other video lmao
There's actually another Hollow Knight reference in Bug Fables. You can pay someone to cast a spell on you for random effects in battle, and the most expensive version is called "Overcharmed".
There is a final fantasy reference in gwacumeelee. That cactus thing.
Please help, I'm stuck in an infinite loop of watching these 2 video's over and over again, I cant escape! tell my family I love them!
Ah yes my favorite dead cells biome route starts with Level 1: prisoners quarters Level 3: promenade
This man is a god, these two intros are absolutely amazing
I love how he made an exact opposite  to this
SHAW
I love how you used the same / very similar intro
In the scene in the owl house that has the knight in it there's papyrus from Undertale in the bottom left corner but that might just be a random skeleton
are these videos references to dunkey's pokemon let's go videos?
8:37 I don't think it is specific to Australia, Hollow Knight's music is good enough to be included in several other shows. One that I've seen personally is on a French cooking show called "Le Meilleur Pâtissier", where it's used several times during weeks dedicated to Halloween cakes (i'm not even joking)
I don't know the full details, but apparently there's a Hollow Knight reference in this new game coming out called Silksong. As I understand, Hornet has a small cameo in it. Again, I don't know all of the details, but you should think about checking it out when its released, as it's an indie game I haven't seen many people talking about.
...
you can clearly tell mossbag is making reference to how pokemon games come out two-at-a-time, with disparate, yet similar themes. honestly disgusting how mossbag has refused this fact in interviews, considering how obvious it is.
I’m glad you reminded me about space jam 2
The 2020 Murder Hornets took inspiration from Hornet sentinel.
Alright guys, we need to get this guy some ham.
Guacamelee, super turbo championship edition.
Beside the angel from Evangeline is the character Psycho Jenny from the devil man crybaby series,and I think that thing in the bottom right that's playing a keyboard might be a reference to the character Griffith from berserk
Well...  I guess im getting back into dead cells
HELP I've been stuck in a loop for 3 hours and I can't get out!
Mossbag uploading two vids at the same time now that is rare
There's actually also a hollow knight reference I  an indie game known as Lone Fungus, at least on the kickstarter site. On  there it is said that you can customise your mushroom cap thing, and one of those custom ones happen to be very similar to the shell of the knight.  On top of that, there is also another reference in the obscure game know as 'Hollow knight'-
I'm stuck in a loop between Mossbag's two latest videos. Send help!
you forgot hollow knight: silksong
i didnt know the dead cells update was out, imma go play that now
Also, I was watching one TV show of my country (France) and they put not one, not two, BUT THREE ost of Hollow knight. In the same episode. I was extasic. And the top ost with that!! Grimm, the mantis and daughter of Hallownest. It's called Le meilleur Pâtissier if anyone want to check that out (The best Baker I suppose in en)
2 mossbag videos in one day? hohooo
“From digimon”
Hey Mossbro do you think you could do some blaspehmous lore vids cause there is alot of Real life lore and intresting stuff behind it :) would enjoy it certainly
9:15 QUE PORRA É ESSA MAURICIO
Nice
Im so happy you mentioned dandara!! Thats a great game
Amphibia also have an official art were one of the characters, sprig, cosplays as the knight
Team Cherry invented the bench confirmed
In the console versions of the Metroidvania La Mulana 2, you can actually buy items(maybe a map)from Cornifer.
xD That Kingdom Hearts joke!
random video game music featured on reality TV shows is one hell of a rabbit hole (especially house-related ones for some reason)
There's an obscure swedish documentary which uses hollow knight music
I wasn't expecting turma da monica to show up, I live in brazil but never knew about that reference
In a little indie roguelite called Revita, there are 2 items that are references to HK. There's the Shade Cloak item which makes your dashes deal contact damage (obvious reference), and there's the Broken Nail, which makes you deal extra damage to corrupted enemies and bosses. Two simple Easter eggs, but Easter eggs nonetheless
TURMA DA MÔNICA DO NADA HAHAHAHAHHA
Come to Brazil!!!
"I cut myself open to find Hollow Knight reference" would be a great video
Oh yes Turma da Mônica, my favorite
Of all the references, I _really_ didn't expect Turma da Mônica ajsjajdhja that's sooo amazing Vai Brasil!!
9:13 Brazil metioned
7:53 "There is that annoying ass penguin in digimon" People who are picking piplup in BDSP: *Angry pokemon fan noises*
As a Brazilian, I need to say: Turma da Mônica MAKES SO MANY references to both old and new media that is actually hard to keep track of all. There's one special edition about the Paul McCharthey conspiracy that has over 15 references to their music hidden in the dialogue.
Last year on TV in a show celebrating Mexico's independece day, the orchestra as an introduction played the main theme and it was very surprising
All of the jokes in the video crack me up, but as a brazillian, when you pulled the Turma da Mônica comic, I almost had a heart attack.
0:00 wait a minute...
2 videos in one day? Oh mossbag you do spoil us!
Turma da Mônica and mossbag? Never imagined that lmao
Wait if mossbag knows about Neon Genesis Evangelion then does he know about THAT scene?
I played dead cells for the first time today and was promptly awarded the Pure Nail after sitting on a familiar bench... the bench you feature :-)
Fun fact: The Night's nail actually appears for a brief moment in another indie game called "Hollow Knight"
I love how you completely butchered Turma da Mônica
This is a great video, which is a reference to a somewhat obscure type of media known as... YouTube content
I love how it sounds like you have no idea what you were talking about.
Wtf Turma da Mônica moment.
The fact that you used the same script for Amphibia and the Owl House had me dying
Reference-ception
Something to note about the pure nail item in dead cells is that unlike all the other melee weapons, you can move left and right while swinging, there’s even a small amount of knock back in those opposite directions
God I love your sense of humor
Internet Historian uses HK music in his Costa Concordia video too!
There's a Dutch TV show that has also used Greenpath's soundtrack as a background track to explain things to the viewer. I'm not sure how copyright law works on the other side of the globe, but since it was produced by government-supported media producers, I'm sure they use it legally.
I’m pretty sure the ice needle is a reference to  the Ice King from Castle Crashers where during one of his moves he send icicles from the ceiling and yelling shaaa while starting the attack. Still could be Hornet but I doubt it, somebody fact check me if I am wrong
thoughts on a weapon lore video?
7:13 bit unrelated, but I almost wonder if that third sword on the rack is in any way related to Dawnbreaker from the Elder Scrolls (Skyrim and ESO specifically). Narrow hilt without a guard, instead having a miniature sun embedded within (although with the actual Dawnbreaker, it's much more literal lol)
there are a fuck ton of hollow knight references in hollow knight
A Hollow Knight soundtrack in The Block?  It reminds me of that time Megalovania appeared in First Dates a spanish tv show (probably a copy of an american one yeah im not a fan either)
Turma da Mônica \o/
I also only just noticed the psycho jenny plush from devilman crybaby in king's part of the owl house opening! it's right next to the 4th angel
Holy shit double upload
There's also a reference to Psycho Jenny from Devilman Crybaby @ 7:42
Wow what a bunch of nice and clever reference, hopefully nothing trys or is connected to anything Nintendo related
Me when he says piplup is a Digimon:   You have failed as a creator on this platform
We have a reference of hollow knight in Epic Battle Fantasy 5 (or EBF5, for shorts). There's a card you can collect witch is the Knight!
The fact that the Dead Cells team let you have a sneak peek is amazing! Props to you my dude
The mech knight was also a reference to steam world dig 2
There is one other Hollow Knight references you missed out on. It’s actually from Disney’s The Owl House. In the intro the character, “King” is surrounded by stuffed animals and The Knight is one of them.
7:45 is that psycho jenny from devilman crybaby next to the angel?
Just finished GRIME, what an excellent game.
The intro joke tie-in to the other reference video is so funny to me
Our white cells are white and they fight against infection cells, that means that we have hollow knight in our blood.
holy shit your humour is so good i havent cracked like this in a while
i just watched the other video today, and you got me ducked up in a different kind of way
turma da monica <3
I was watching your video when i encountered a shiny Buneary, thanks man! 🐰✨
You are such a crafty individual, mossbag. And I approve.
It's funny how similar the numbers are on the two video's in fact as I'm writing this they are both at 11K likes
MEU DEUS TURMA DA MÔNICA SHUAHSUHASUHAUS
The music appearing in a TV show completely unrelated to it's origin reminds of that one time I was watching a french reality TV show and without context the background music was the theme song from "your name".
3h 54k 707
I see what you did there with the introduction of both videos you just released. Anyways, nice vids as always
I hate references. Remember when Mario was on SNL? or that time Rick and Morty showed up in Space Jam 2?  That was so pathetic, I'll remember that scene until the day I die.
M O R E
An episode of a dutch tv show by youtuber Tim Hofman used the fungal wastes theme one time. I dunno why, but it made me so happy hearing that
I'm stuck. Stuck in an infinite loop of mossbag content. Every time a video ends it just recommends the the one I watched prior. Send help, this is no joking matters.
I see, so you haven’t seen the ‘you can’t un-connect your favorite franchise from fortnite’ image that was floating around awhile back
Brazil mentioned 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
9:27 you also missed mike the knight from the popular american children’s show mike the knight
Ooooo
Internet Historian used Hornet song in his Costa Concordia video
Лол, надо попробовать "Полового рыцаря", я уверен, что бурда какая-то
Bug Fables also has a lot of other references, like a hidden room with some clear indications, and the weapons that some wanderers use, closely resembling the nails, and also the fact that there's a medal called overcharmed
You got me wanting to play kingdom hearts
Tboi lore expert  Uhm actually requiem was the second expansion to four souls.... what an egregious error........ I sure hope somebody got fired for THAT blunder
Nobody is talking about how Mossbag described the plot of "Amphibia" and "The Owl House" the exact same way, using the exact same words, and they both apply. Goes to show how out of content Disney is atm with their animated TV shows. I appreciate the chuckles I received from that small detail in the script, Mossbag. Very cool 👍
mossbag gets my respect for using antibirth music in the binding of isaac segment. seriously such a good soundtrack.
I love that my two favorite shows of the time dead cells and dead cells have gotten the knight to cameo so cool
Love how mossbag loves the Rick and morty and snl references now
Porra Maurício!

There's a danish documentary that uses Hornet's theme at some point
I just realized You're the Cybershell of Hollow Knight.
You don’t have hollow knight in your blood cells already?   ..should I see a doctor? 😰
This was great
Two mossbag uploads in a single day? Somebody pinch me
BRASIL FOI MENCIONADO
In this video: I love references!  In the other video: I hate references!  I just loved it 🤣😂
That SHAA!! reference was pretty cultured
I want a Knight costume in Fall Guys xD
Amphibia is a better show than Owl House.
9:55, you know what that would be a very interesting topic, you should make that vid some time moss.
Mmm The sarcasm to content ratio Truly the salt and vinegar chips of entertainment
Hollow Knight Silksong is a metroidvania game about a young girl stumbling into a strange fantasy kingdom, where she must learn to live among bizarre, new creatures and maybe even make a few friends along the way.
In bug fables also a nail appears in one of the chapters I don’t know which one but it’s a nail in a rock
Not sure if mods count, but the Spirit Mod for Terraria features a melee weapon based on the Knight's nail. You can choose the direction to swing and even pogo off of enemies
One Step From Eden has another reference to Hollow Knight. There's a card called Rest that has you stay still and heal, and the art for it shows the Knight resting on a bench. The text on it also says "For when you're feeling Hollow"
If I'm not mistaken, Blasphemous has a hidden room with a lot of pictures on the wall referencing other indie games, Hollow Knight included :P
In the section with the sharpened nail and master sword (7:12) I think the bottom one could be Dawnbreaker from Skyrim. It has the same color hilt and blade and the emblem in the middle looks like the sun, and Dawnbreaker while not exactly the same has a ring with a glowing orb in the center.
I know you're doing deliberate misinformation bits all throughout the video but for some reason the Knight on mars and you calling it the moon triggered a twitch of annoyance lmao
9:44 "Or in the moon" continues to show the surface of Mars and rovers 😂
666th comment?
Maybe, this is a reference to hollow knight
Shovel knight was also the first major crossover in brawlhalla!
:D
get this man some ham.
Bug Fables might have a second reference to Hollow Knight! In a hidden alley in Defiant Root, there's a "charm" salesman (meant to be an equivalent to Merlee from Paper Mario with a similar service), whose maximum charm they can give you is "Overcharmed." Maybe it's just a coincidence, but "Overcharmed" is a pretty specific term, so finding it in a game where there's already Hollow Knight inspiration made clear, I wouldn't be surprised if it was intentional.
Lol you did the same description for both the shows
hollownite
You forgot all references to hollow knight in hollow knight
The hollow knight music appearing in the Australian TV show reminds of me of that time sans' theme was playing in the background of a Chinese news broadcast
U r crazy... Good w these 2 videos. Nice job
Huge reference hollow knight in silksong no way
Help, I'm stuck in an infinite Mossbag video loop
those games are so old funny they reference them now in dead cells
hold up first what Ed of turma da Mônica hollow knight showed up? and second as a Brazilian and former reader i know turma da Mônica do referência a ton lot of things, think about anything, they made a reference
Imma play some dead cells while the update is fresh
So true
9:30 славу богу я живу в России
There is this new obscure game coming out at some point, which judging from the trailer, seems to have a lot of reference to hollow knight Go see for yourself, it's called Silksong
is this a fever dream i just came from the references in hollow knight where you did the exact same reference opener but saying you hated them
So this is what the knight did during their time away from hallownest
TURMA DA MONICA CARAAALJOOOOOOOOO
i hope that the Knight will be referenced in the upcoming indie game Hollow Knight: Silksong
Help I’m stuck in an infinite loop of hollow-knight homage videos
Omg, I'm can't believe it The Knight have a cameo in 2 my favorite Disney cartoon show Amphibia and The Owl house  Thank mossbag for this amazing Easter eggs, and those cartoon show is so amazing btw :3
In a dutch documentary i was watching, I was literally jumping on my couch because the sudden appearance of the fungal wastes ost got me going apeshit on adrenaline.
You forgot the reference where a character from "Hollow Knight" makes an appearance in an upcoming game called "Silksong". I know it isn't released yet, so we can't be sure, but the main character bears a striking resemblance to the Knight's sister. Maybe you should make a video on it once it comes out!
2 moss bag videos in 1 day???? BASED‼️
Amphibia isn’t the only show to reference hollow knight, family guy-
Will shovel knight be in silk song?
Wait a minute I feel as if there is disturbance in the beginning the universe should not have been correlated this way?
As an Australian, I did not expect the block to be there! Holy moly that curve ball!
Awesome reference to the easter egg video at the start there.  B)
This video is full of banger joke after banger joke, nice one :)
I heard "Hollow knight", "connect" and "fortnite" and immediately realised something if far from right.
Turma da Mônica goat
mossbag stuck us all in an infinite loop of clicking the link at the end of the videos to see media referencing Hollow Knight and Hollow Knight referencing other medias, this was his plan, he has trapped us forever
i love how this video is a reference to his other video
So how do you get the Vessel outfit?
Ah. I love you mossbag
The duality of man.
They actually played hk music in a french TV show about baking
Shovel Knight frim Shovel Knight< Hollow Knight from Hollow Knight
Help I'm stuck in a loop of watching videos about Hollow Knight references and references in Hollow Knight
A pretty obscure Roguelite called "Monolith" has a reference to Hollow Knight.  One of the final bosses has the first half of its fight mainly composed of a boss rush against amalgamations of other bosses in the game, and one of the possible amalgamations is called "The Radiant", which looks similar to and has multiple attacks directly referencing The Radiance.
I've been stuck in a infinite loop video for about an hour if anyone finds this message call for help
You forgot dragonfable. In one of the Halloween events, one of the masks was called the "empty warrior mask" which is greatly resembles the knight.
In the Epic Battle Fantasy 5 game (a somewhat popular flash game) there is a monster card named "hollow soldier" that is a direct reference to hollow knight both by name and design
How is no one- you know what never mind I'm putting the tin foil hat back on
He uploaded them back to back
The videos are opposite
Am I the only one seeing this
Man I'm glad to hear you love references in media. I just watched another Hollow Knight references video, and the jackass at the beginning went on about how he HATED references! I couldn't believe it, ridiculous.
Isn't this the exact wait this is the exact opposite video of the last video wha   *Skelly1243.exe has stopped working*
You forgot to mention that Hornet will be in this small little game called Hollow Knight Silksong but that's ok it's easy to miss
I'm a Hollow Knight and Owl House fan but I must've been terribly blind to continuously miss the lil guy in the theme song that I don't skip..
A game called Epic Battle Fantasy has collectible cards that act as tiny stat boosts, and one card is a reference to HK, which was awesome to find.  Also, I cant believe I never found that easter egg in Owl House
I'd like to bring up that Hollow Knight music being used on the block isn't anything new with australian television. On a news segment about covid-19, one part of the segment used sans music from undertale. I'm assuming because they thought this was stock music since they can hear it coming from their childs ipad every day
You misses Silk Song. In this game a creature resembling Hornet apearse?
Non-brasilians saying "Turma da Monica" will forever be funny to me
Among the plushies is Griphith from Berserk....I know I fucked up the name
Broken Vessel lore video ?? It has no shade; but somehow has dream ghost soul thing even though it should be incompatible since void and essence are enemies.
what the fuck is Asia? damn you really found some deep cut references in here.
There’s a game called Transformice where you are a mouse and you get cheese on different maps. Theres an item that was a limited time item, one you could buy for your mouse to wear. It’s Hornet’s needle! Your mouse holds it in its hands when it stands up.
The more Hollow Knight references I witness, the more obsessed I become with Silksong.
Reckreeium
I, too have the Hollow Knight and Shovel Knight within my bloodstream.
And also the banker in bug fables looks like conifers wife
I absolutely love references and crossovers, and Hollow Knight, so this video is perfect
Lol
VAI BRASIL!!!!!!!!!
In the children's novel series, 'Harry Potter' there are empty suits of armor throughout the main setting of the story, a castle called 'Hogwarts.' Empty suits of armor could also be referred to as "Hollow Knights." This reference is especially impressive, since the first Harry Potter book came out in 1998, nineteen years before Hollow Knight's release.
In the Swedish tv-program "Din Hjärna" they use the OST - Enter Hallownest
Don't forget Shovel Knight in Brawlhalla
BRAZIL MENTIONED Carai :D
These annoying Digimon references are everywhere
Hearing one of my favourite YouTubers talk about references from my favorite game in some of my favourite shows like toh and amphibia is a really strange feeling
Bug fables is an underrated master piece
Devilman? 7:47
I think I'm stuck in a loop
Man I thought i saw this intro somewhere else almost like.. a reference.
Mossbag said Among Us, threshold got breached.
Okay but you for real made me actually think about what my own opinion on references is with those intros
SNL potshot wasn't very funny, didn't laugh
You forgot about the reference in this epic Roblox game called Rouge Lineage. It uses the same sound effect of the charged nail slash for a move called owl slash from the ultra class Shinobi. Only people who genuinely hate themselves play this game but it sure is an experience
I’ve watched both owl house and amphibia after playing hollow knight I feel like such a fake fan 😭
In MCC in the minigame battle box, when you loose a fight a text will show up saying Git gud
Maurício de Souza não tá nem aí pra direitos autorias, pense em alguma coisa e essa coisa com certeza vai estar em algum gibi da Turma da Monica.
The opening joke in both parts was gold
Maybe the real "lore" channel was the cameos we made along the way
Kkkkkkk mossbag é bem aleatório, mas nunca pensei que veria Turma da Monica num vídeo dele xD
Dislike this comment to like the video.
Dude I finished the other video without knowing about this one and the first 5 seconds cracked me up
Two years ago, a show called "le meilleur pâtissier" was airing in Belgium and, for the Halloween special, they used ONLY Hollow Knight OST...Mainly thinking about  -Mantis Lords -Hollow Knight -Nightmare King Grimm  And so on and so forth for two and a half hours
2 videos in a day? You clearly know when Silksong is being released and can't brag about it.
The reference to Berserk in a Griffith plushie sitting behind a piano at 7:40 made me livid
no way double mossbag upload
mossbag previous video: I hate references. mossbag this video: I love references.  I love this kind of humor.
It was a groundbreaking momet when Hollow Knight invented the bench.
I've been clicking the link between the two videos for 2 hours now. Help
2 videos on the same day!?
Cool
0:57 "in a room found in the third level of the game"  the promenade of the condemned is the second level of dead cells
Parallel intros lol
10:00 Instructions unclear, I have been watching these 2 videos in an endless purgatory of Hollow Knight references. Send help.
I remember minecraft dungeons using hollow knight music on one of it's trailers
OH GOD I'M IN A LOOP BETWEEN THE TWO VIDEOS PLEASE LET ME OUT
7:37 I just noticed what looks like Griffith nearish to the bottom right. On the other side from it is a devil from devilman crybaby Also at 9:37 top left is a bear looking Giorno from jojo
THANK MOSSBAG NOW I KNOW WHAT TO ASK FOR MY BOYFRIEND TO BRING ME WHEN HE COMES FROM RUSSIA but fr i didn't know something like that even existed-
I love that mossbag is slowly adding more and more shitposting to his videos. Truly the best timeline. And a good video <3
I think the best Hollow Knight cameos are in this guy mossbag's videos tbh not sure if it was intentional but there's always a chance
That episode of Scooby Doo was pretty fire tho ngl
I was rewatching amphibia literally the other day and saw that nail and now this, man that's a cool coincidence
The longer the video went on, I became less and less sure about whether or not you are memeing or if the references of actually true.
Oh he's going insane
I love/hate both of these intros/outros, they're very funny/unfunny
You sneaky sneaky guy... I watched both videos
Id say The Hollow Knight from Hollow Knight is a pretty cool reference
TWO mossbag videos in a single day AND a Dead Cells update??? today is a great day
Mossbag I'm doing my taxes, I don't need your wario references to trip me up.
OMG so proud of my Brazilian fellow artists. Getting Dandara and Turma da Mônica (which means Monica's Gang) - which is a comic book series about a small group of friends who lives in a small neighborhood. They had a lot of characters in different groups like Turma da Penadinho (about some ghosts and monsters), Chico Bento (showing a more rural part of the country), The Tribe (about indigenous people), and there's the Green Elephant which is called Jotalhão and is part of a setting about animals.  Turma da Mônica is very loved by us Brazilians and makes part of most people's childhood. Great video!
9:13 Hey l'm from Brasil : )
Oh no I'm caught in a loop Help
DUDE HOW THE FUCK DID YOU FIND    TURMA DA MÔNICA BOT BEING A BRAZILIAN THE LEVEL OF RESEARCH IS UNBELIEVABLE
Dude, 2 films one day - you spoil us :O
I both believe end dont believe everything you said
fall guys is literally the cameo haven
YO BRASILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
lol in the last video he was complaining about wario on snl and rick and morty in space jam
NO WAY AMPHIBIA??? AND OWL HOUSE OMG
hey, i think you forgot to add a link to one of the games you talked about in this video. a little known game called hollow knight. would be great if you could add a link to it's steam page too, since i don't think many people here have heard about it before.
Mossbags channel would be a great psychological study
I'm stuck in an endless loop watching this two videos! Somebody help
Help I’m trapped in a recursive loop of end cards
Hornet isn't the only reference in One Step From Eden. There is a rest ability that has a clear image of the knight and says on it, "for when you're feeling hollow"
I can't believe Something Else: Four Souls is the one link that bridges Empty Squire and Forklift!
Dark Souls
Yeah keep in my mind that this video is another easter egg cz both released in the same time
infinite loop
Hollow Knight is definitely in your Blood Cells
a meta video joke. Touché mossbag, Touché.
Right I like Hollow Knight its cool and all but
Was not expecting amphibia and toh in a mossbag video :0
9:14 nem fodendo kkkkkkk
In the game of life there is a reference to hollow knight, players when using a class from the animal kingdom get hit they bleed. This is a reference to when the knight gets damaged.
Omg haha you mentioned Amphibia in this video........... yknow Amphibia has a lot of really cool lore to be discussed, that would be pretty cool methinks........something to talk about while waiting for the new Hollow Knight game................... just kidding haha omg ignore me. unless you can think about it though (i am luring you with a piece of cheese on a stick)
Wait, WHERE I CAN BUY THIS BEER?!!
never thought I'd see among us in a hollow knight references video
The split personality between the last two videos leaves me with a sad face on my face
I like ham
We are the knight
I know a reference you missed! it's actually pretty widespread. If you get killed by someone in a first person shooter, they'll very often have the flavor text "get good loser", which is a pretty blatant reference to Hornet. hope this helps!
im confusion
That's weird... I'm pretty sure I already watched this video 10 minutes ago... From another video quite similar I might add..
litteraly the opposite of what he said at the other vid
oh god, now im stuck in a loop
Dead cells is a masterpiece my second most favourite 2D game after hollow knight
BRAZIL MENTIONED
8:17 Hold on. I am going to guess the cameo that appears here. Ok, so. The couple purchases a fairly normal looking house in a friendly neighbourhood. The family who owned it last went missing mysteriously. The house seller takes them up to the door and says "Here is your house. If you need me I will be in my car. I can not hear you scream" The couple happily waves the seller goodbye and thanks him for showing them this house. The couple open the door of the house very slowly, and next moment, they are standing face to face with the real knight from hollow knight, 6ft tall and holding a sharpened nail. The couple scream in terror but it is no use as the seller cannot hear them from their locked car as the door shuts behind them.  The couple are never seen or heard from again
All of the crossover references in these games are fantastic. It makes the indie community feel so tight
I love "the title of the game is a reference to the bible, but more importantly there's a hollow knight reference"
wtf turma da monica do nada kkkkkkkk
Im so proud of myself for noticing both references in Amphibia and The Owl House.
based mossbag
amfibia and owl house are made by mega nerds
3:10 FF Cactaur
Kind of a stretch but I believe the dawnbreaker from skyrim is with tith the sharpened nail and master sword at 7:06
The emperor in the owl house also straight up looks like an unused Hollow Knight Godmaster NPC
Both videos had a Digimon joke. I'm impressed.
I feel a strange yet familiar urge to click on the link at the end of this video
This is a pretty genius upload order.
I love that you made it so they both videos came out in the same day because you wanted to do that little gag at the end there, they're just a great pairing of videos to release, also instead of just making an hour long video you get that YouTube retention 10 to 15 minutes vibe going on
OMG BUG FABLES WAS MENTIONED This game was made by my friend. Just get so happy and proud whenever anyone talks about it. Such a good game
honestly just glad to see moss talk about the owl house and amphibia lol
I hate references! I love references!
Hell yea bug fables
This video is just an elaboration of the message "GUYS THERE'S OTHER FANDOMS OUT THERE DON'T SPEND EVERY LIVING DAY ROTTING AWAY WAITING FOR SILKSONG AND RE-PLAYING HOLLOW KNIGHT TO LOOK FOR NEW SMALL HIDDEN EASTER EGGS LIKE ME!!!" or something like that
HK is getting iconic!
I could use some void in my blood cells, that would give me motivation to persue POWER!
As a brazilian, I would NEVER expect mossbag to mention Turma da Mônica of all things. I'm so happy.
Was quite literally just binging hollow Knight videos
Don't you even think about going to Russia! Because I am here, and you won't survive joke in the beginnings of videos. It's too relatable!
its totally the same vid but change topic xd
oooooooooooooooooooom  Mossbag is running out of ideas. (still great though
Wait i just finished the refrences in hollow knight vid and... THIS IS A FUCKING DOUBLE UPLOAD
caralho turma da monica mano KJkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
I love that at the start of each video he's either praising or scolding the Space Jam 2 Rick and Morty appearance.
13.5? What is this, Touhou?
I've gotta say, the last 3 references really upped the ante there -- I really never expected someone to talk about Turma da Monica in 2021 with Hollow Knight. But I guess it kinda makes sense since brazilian artists are always kinda tied with indie gaming in some way (Dandara included).
Nice use of Antibirth music during the Isaac portion of the video!
nice cool video recycle. what you just gonna upload this exact same video a 3rd time with different voiceover? How many times can you beat a dead horse?
we're waiting for you in Russia
Turma da monica nem fudendo
Ahhh the setup has finally paid off
9:40 "game is really good"  Yeah.. try telling Nerrel that....
i remember russian series called 'heroes of envell' (im not sure whether its correct). and i saw hollow knight reference there. one of main heroes had a picture of the knight on her lock screen. :]
I did not expect to see turma da monica in a mossbag video
Can't wait for the obscure references in the bible video
My favorite rick and morty cameo was the one in My Little Pony
You forgot the greatest reference to hollow knight. Its when an obscure game known as Hollow Knight, references the popular game, Hollow Knight, by letting the player play as The Vessel during an important part of the game and even fight a few bosses and enemies from the popular game known as Hollow Knight
goddamnit. that double intro baited me so hard
The beginning is a reference to his hollow knight references vid
My man hit puberty damn
ya gorah
Ori In The Blind Forest is a reference to Hollow Knight
absolutely based usage of the antibirth ost in the tboi section
Are you purposefully not fully pronouncing "requiem" so as to avoid mispronouncing it?
It's incredibly amazing how many works make references to the Hollow Knight
There are multiple references to hollow knight in the bible have you ever read Revelations
"so we can also connect Hollow Knight to Fortnite" was the first quote ever that, gave me a solid reason to dislike one of ur videos.
Oh shit that new update came out let's goooo
its like getting both pokemon games
Finally he is taking his place in the multiverse.
The knight so iconic
AMOGUS!
4:21 Luke, Brett & Dave are gonna hate this one.
Mossbags video is about a knight stumbling into a strange fantasy world where they must learn to live amongst bizarre new creatures and maybe even make a few friends along the way
7:37 berserk cameo
I've played bug fables & seen that line of dialogue and didn't realize it was a hollow knight reference lmao
I actually didn’t know if there were any references to chrono trigger in amphibia, pls let me know because I couldn’t find any.
As a Brazilian, Im not surprised the Knight shows up in Turma da Monica. They reference EVERYTHING.
9:13 quando eu entrei nesse video eu nunca imaginei que iria ver turma da Mônica
The fucking "Shaa!" caught me off guard.
Huh, interesting.
Jeez, The Knight is fighting Hornet for a while...
You see, Hollow Knight music appearing on The Block is actually a reference to "the outside". This is the location your parents gather your food from and which you've been too afraid to go to due to the possibility of encountering the rumored shovel weilding blue man.
I love how you used exact same description for Amphibia and The Owl House. Both are great shows, by the way.
at the beginning of the other video he said that he hated references and that he hated the rick and morty scene HMMMMMMM
I keep clicking the link at he end of the video please help me I'm stuck in a loop.
Wow what a great video idea I’m glad Mossbag’s recommendation was picked up by someone
0:30 don‘t forget Brawlhalla! He is everywhere
Did you change the title ?
Theres a popular mod for Terraria called Joostmod that adds a set of nails and a Knight mask.  the weapon do actually let you bounce on stuff, very fun
two mossbag videos in a single day? what sorcery is this?
There’s one in a rather obscure indie game called blood will be spilled, where the knight is sitting at a bar
7:08 And y'know, it does actually make in-universe sense for there to be a giant nail weapon given that Amphibia is a world of giant amphibians and bugs
Can't believe you didn't mention this kind of obscure upcoming game "Hollow Knight: Silksong". I can see how you missed the reference, though, it only shows up briefly in the new game.
Help, Im stuck in a infinite loop of mossbag videos about hollow knight referances and referances to hollow knight. The videos keep linking the other at the end and I just cant help but click it.
Dude, that intro, you goddamn genius!
@5:05 WAS THAT NECESSARY???
GTA 6 will have a hollow knight cameo
I don't think I can reasonably say to myself that Hollow Knight is an underdog anymore.
I absolutely loved the double upload that links to each other 😂 amazing
I will like this video
The true question is, which one is the first one to watch?
I think mossbag forgot to mention Hollow knight making a reference in Hollow knight  Truly disappointing.
I can't belive turma da monica made it to this list, gotta love your channel
KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK turma da mônica é muito foda slk
There's also also a hollowknight reference in revita 😩
Amphibia - I remember seeing the nail! Honestly love the show and how much it’s creators are influenced by games and the like. I think they do it very honestly, like there isn’t a random Minecraft episode or anything.
🌳Bruh, all these inside jokes make me worried. Is mossbag okay or has he actually run out of content to talk about?😥
а где такое пиво продается :0
9:29 lol, the beer even called "Hollow Knight"
Next to the fourth angel plushie is a pink hair plushie referenced to devil man cry baby
I have to be quick, I am trapped in a loop where I go from this video to the easter eggs in Hollow Knight video. I am on my 8th loop and there is no end in sight. I cannot be saved, I only plead that you turn back before its too late.
Shaa
sometimes your jokes make me wanna shake you like a rattle
This man is so desperate for new Hollow Knight content he's begun seeking it from other games.
Are you serious? Well fine.....but it's not going good for you.
Another subtle reference was in Donkey Kong Country 2, where they added a Bee-themed level in homage to The Hive from Hollow Knight.  It is similarly relaxing and not frustrating at all, making it a pretty obvious reference, once you think about it.
Isn't there also a Nail hidden in Bug Fables?
Shaaaaaash, vessel is in four souls? Can I still buy this expansion tho?
Hello, journal. I swear I've started every entry with a date or some kind of a time mark but now I've completely lost track of time. mossbag has put me into an endless loop in wich I must view his two recent videos ("Top 13.5 Hollow Knight cameos in other media" and "Hidden Easter Eggs in Hollow Knight" very good content btw highly recommend) repeatedly, clicking that goddamn link over and over again. I have now every line of the script engraved deeply into my memory. My thoughts have became Hollow Knight references themselves. This is true torment. I can not escape. I have nothing but you, my journal.
you missed the part where shovel knight made it into rivals of aether
Another game The Knight cameos in that many people will not have heard of is a metroidvania known as Hollow Knight in which you play as a 'vessel' and you stab stuff until they start bleeding orange juice   wait this comment is unoriginal 💀
Shaw
The virtue of mea del culpa hath risen
I love the fact that the synopsis of TOH and Amphibia are exactly the same
BORA BRAZIL
As a Russian, from what I could find they stopped making that beer, so this place officially has no reasons to be visited
Dude the beginning of this video made me have an existential crisis for a sec…
Then, suddenly, a dunkey moment.
I need, NEEEED, more of that steampunk knight with a drill hand
No puedo creer que pusieron al caballero de la pala en Shovel Knight increible lo que sakurai puede hacer
Dijimon Realy it’s Pokémon
There's actually a clever reference to Hornet in the obscure upcoming game "Hollow Knight: Silksong"
9:46 New from Team Cherry! Inject the Knight into your veins!
Other lemon moment
So I was watching "Hidden Easter Eggs in Hollow Knight", by habit opened another youtube tab, saw this one and clicked it too to watch in a second and it started off saying the polar opposite, have to love yourself some mossbag huh
Wait what is happening
DEAD CELLS UPDATE!?
7:54 Annoying ass penguin from Digimon is actually Piplup from Pokemon Lmao
You should have called this video “top 10 hollow knight games”
mossbag just straight up collabed with himself, damn
The jokes here are ON POINT
Fun fact: in the calamity mod for terraria there is a difficulty setting called iron heart which prevents healing it also changes your health ui into masks instead of hearts
In bug fables there’s also a broken nail in a room behind a cracked wall
I live for mossbag saying Turma da Mônica lmao
2 VIDEOS ON THE SAME DAY HELL YEAH
You seriously need to play Guacamelee 1 & 2 the 1st one is great & the 2nd washes out all its flaws & adds new stuff, making it even better
SuS
9:29 it's not beer ..it's drinkable void
Lmao the fact that the video that he posted right before this said that he hates references and this says that he loves references
three hundred and sixteenth
wtf, 2 videos in a day ? something changed
This fucking intro
I really think it's cool that the fictional character Tyler 'ninja' Blevins can be linked to the hit indie game Hollow Knight. Really makes you think.
please stop talking about rick and morty being in space jam 2 i beg you please
I thought you hated cross overs?
help I'm stuck in an infinite loop of clicking to the other video
Okay so if Ninja is a real person and is in fortnite and hollow knight and fortnite are connected does that make hollow knight non fiction? Is C-19 just void?
9:32 oh man, I was looking for one of those little easter eggs he usually puts in his docs :(
Nice unique intro!
I've been stuck in an infinte loop between these two reference videos for the last two hours. please send help and water. I'm beginning to think I AM Wario from SNL.
I just realized, moss bag may be a little obsessed with hollow knight, but its not like he spent time making an hour long video on lore.
The contrasting openings remind why I love this channel
I paused the video at the end dead cells section feeling a sudden need to kill monsters, and 10 minutes later I found the hollow knight reference. I am freaking out.
Maybe the real Hollow Knight was the friends we made along the way XD
*_D-D-D-DOUBLE UPLOAD_*  *electric guitar riff*
So, what i learned is that Alex hirsch is a hollow knight fan. Not surprising tbh
i love the bit in the intros of this and the other video. very funny, did laugh
He just completely did a 180 on his opinion since the last video lmao I'M DYING
Damn double upload Nice duality
9:16 yo thats heckin mike the knight to the right side
Before anyone asks, yes, this is an alternate universe.
wtf two vids       he's beyond the point of insanity
Amongus in mossbag nice
I love how the intro for this video and the other video contradicts each other.
First time hearing of bug fable, shut up and take my money
7:37 Is that a griffith plushie playing the keyboard?
2 videos back to back, you’re insane mossbag
7:36 also a reference to Berserk with Femto
7:37 Is that... the suicide bread from Humanity has declined?? That has to be the most obscure reference I've seen lol
For the billboard reference in the "Guacamelee! 2" i would consider the show-like nature of most Lucha Libre. So Shovel Knight an Hollow's Knight participating in same wrestling event could in fact hint to their actual kinship
Whatching back to back
OK THAT FALL GUYS JOKE WAS UNCALLED FOR, JESUS CHRIST-
There are actually several Hollow Knight references in Bug Fables. My favorite one is in in Chomper Cave, there’s a secluded room that has a nail (probably the Knight’s) in it.
Lmao the intro is the exact opposite as the one for the Easter Egg Video
For a brazilian, hearing him speaking Turma da Monica (monica's gang) its só funny
now this video. It is also great
love that your two videos about references reference each other
calling dead cells metroidvania is like saying that Hornet is void
mossbag: "I love references" Also mossbag: "I hate references"
oh my god you released them at the same time i thought i was watching the same video
y'know, collabs are meant to be done by more than 1 person
@Mossbag there is a Hollow Knight shirt in Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes
Another (possible) Owl house reference is the main antagonist, Emperor belos, a somewhat immortal, horrible parent figure, god-related person who sacrifices people to keep his reign. He has nice  antler bug helmet thing, very similar to the knights head thingy.
The modern monetary system.  Had the learn all of that for economics classes in school years ago and now I pretty much don't remember any of it.
Wtf 2 mossbag videos in one day? Easily best day this year
Double Upload?!?!?!? Casual Mossbag W
The Knight from "Hollow Knight" also makes an appearance in another small, unknown indie game called "Hollow Knight". If you look closely you can notice that you play as a character with a striking resemblance to The Knight and also share the same name. This may or may not be a little nod to the hit indie game "Hollow Knight". But maybe it's just coincidence and I'm going insane.
Kinda offended that you described amphibia and the owl house in the exact same way but you’re completely correct so I can’t be mad ._.
I think mossbag has ascended
The Knight is linked to Fortnite. Alright. How much further can we go?  Fortnite has had some Avengers events in the past. Star Lord is a part of the Avengers. Chris Pratt plays as Star Lord. Know who Chris Pratt is going to voice in an upcoming movie? Super Mario. Mario is in Smash, and, there we go. We can link The Knight to any piece of media in existence
wait a second... i thought he hates references
This video was just a big ad.  Corporate shill
9:27 Also the name of the beer literally translates as "Hollow Knight". What the hell, I want this
About the Russian beer - it literally says "hollow knight" there
Calling ninja a fictional character really caught me off guard
I think I heard somewhere that hollowknight is actually one big reference to hollowknight. I'm really not sure tho :/
Don't tell him but I don't have a crush on mossbag
That is very cheeky of you, Sir. 6:29
Here i thought you hated references and cameos...
Let's goooooo Brazil mentioned!
Two mossbag videos in one day? This is the greatest day of my life.
Glad forager's part in this video was short. The dev doesn't deserve it to be advertised.
I would love a show about someone who ends up in a fantasy world and has to learn how to live with bizarre new creatures and makes friends along the way
9:46 *I A M V O I D*
Double upload? It’s like two whole moss-flavored cakes!!!
Cant believe I missed the hollow knight plushy in the owl house.
Turma da Mônica!!!!!!
Watching the videos side by side was fucking wonderful.
silksong needs to release team cherry before we all lose our minds
they had us in the first half not gonna lie
Foragers a great game.
Did anyone notice when mossbag called a pokemon a digimon just curious
There's been a TV show in France that used Hollow Knight music at some point. It's a cooking competition called "Le Meilleur Pâtissier", translated "The Best Pastry Chef" and it used Mantis Lords, Grimm and Hollow Knight themes at some point.
I actualy I just found out Dead Cells got this big ubdate. I will check it out
LOL "That annoying ass penguin from Digimon", xD that had me rollin'!
NÃO ESPERAVA NEM UM POUQINHO, turma da monica aqui
Hmmm I wonder where this intros references is from?
Didn’t even mention that time when shovel knight made it into just shapes and beats
The first time I've heard someone else mention one step from eden
My guy you forgot about shovel Knight from brawlhalla
Damn, you really don't have much HK content to talk about, do you?
In *Bug Fables* you can also find a secret room with a Nail and the Delicate Flower.
When are we gonna get the Bug Fables lore explained video.
Lol
What is it now, funny greek man?
I really didn't expect the hollow kinght's Turma da Mônica easter egg being shown  BRAZIL MENTIONED
Did you know that the entirety of Hollow Knight is a reference to Hollow Knight
I'm french and in France we got a television show name "le meilleur pâtissier" (literally "the best pastry chef" ) and, I don't know why,  one time they use Grimm and Mantis Lord theme for one of their episode.   I'm pretty sure this was actually copyright infringement.
BRO WHAT I played adventure pals like 6 years ago on my broken laptop, it was a flash game back then
shaaaa
I think it very cool for team cherry games to have added a reference to team cherry's hollow knight in their upcoming game "sIlksong", as they added the character "Hornet" as an hard to find easter egg, its a quite niche reference so I get if you dont know about it
hollow knight is just an evolution of amongus, once you'll see it you start too see this little knight everywhere
If you're looking into Hollow knight references, there's a little known channel called mossbag that inserts a small cameo of the game every video. You've got to keep one eye peeled open though!
Thanks for making me install Forager, I was looking for a game like this. I hope it's good
Kkkk
Dead Cells and hollow knight are both top games in my favourites. The reveal left me in a state of pure joy.
5:11 is comedy gold
S H O V E L
This intro is a bit contradictory
He mentioned bug fables, nice
shovel knight is also in brawlhalla
I know about dead cells crossover and reference,and i know about tboi.  I made a HK reference myself in one of my drawings. (A comically small nail in weapon shop)
A giant version The Knight's Nail can be found in an upper area of Snakemouth Den in Bug Fables.
AMOGUS
Gringos speaking (brazilian) portuguese tend to butcher it all the time but you nailed (heh) it, I give if a 9/10
There is a bad movie I watched a while ago called something like “ the heroes of the galaxy” and in it one of the kids has a hollow knight home screen
two videos in a day whoa
"There is an other fictional chara ter in falls guys named ninja" OOOOHHHHHHHGGGG
Caralhoooooooooo, ele falou da Turma da Mônica!
Объективно говоря, я не ожидал последний пункт. Браво! Вы действительно меня удивили...
there's also a Russian cartoon called "Heroes of Envell" that has a couple of Hollow Knight art references within it, one in particular being one of the characters using Hollow Knight artwork as their wallpaper! it's in ep 18 of the first season, iirc
Ooh, a double upload, sick!
When making a reference to a game, do devs reach out to the original game devs or not? I'm curious, as it's partly just a kind of shoutout but it's also borrowing some of their creative property.
I am the 9999 viewer
Eu NÃO esperava ver a turma da Mônica neste vídeo, porém cá estou eu.
I’m in an endless cycle due to continually clicking on the link at the end of each video.
CARALHO, EU NÃO ESPERAVA VER TURMA DA FUCKING MÔNICA AQUI
TWO videos, mossbag?! You're awesome!
ANTIBIRTH MUSICCCC
They used the greenpath song in a swedish educational documentary
The Knight also appears in the owl house s2e3
Hollow Knight is everywhere, I see it in my dreams. And in my nightmares…
i wonder if there is an hollow knight refrence in hollow knight
Wait..... 2 MOSSBAG VIDEOS IN THE SAME DAY?! We are blessed!
i see what you did there my guy.
2 videos in a row? Nice.
you should analyse the bible to see if there are any hollow knight easter eggs in there
mossbag is losing his grip on reality. Everything is becoming bug to him.
Wow, i can finally say The Knight appears in a brazilian kid's comic I am truly proud of my country Also, just to clear something up, that green elephant is called Jotalhão, an extremely famous character made by Maurício de Souza, which also made Turma da Mônica (Mônica's Gang, as they adapted it in english speaking countries). He's so famous to the point of appearing in the label for tomato sauce Also! A lil fun fact, Maurício de Souza was actually close friends with Osamu Tezuka, creator of Astro Boy  Thank you Mossbag for aknowledging my country's existence! Leagues ahead of the people in your server...
Bug Fables is on sale for the next 30 minutes if anyone wants to play that fantastic game
Hang on I swear I’ve seen that intro somewhere before
An awesome game called Revita has an item called the broken nail :)
I can't believe mossbag finally discussed the minor indie game among us. It really is wholesome how he helps out small games like these
YES, PROMOTE BUG FABLES, YES!
We all know the knight is void. Void is made from Black balls, and if that is correct, the references are very spread out.
You lowkey made me think I'd actually get back into Fall Guys after months if they added The Knight skin
I really do wonder if someone made a video about references to other series in Hollow Knight. It's sad that we'll never know for sure.
Does anyone remember the Mario reference in Mario
So mossbag are you still in kinky shit? Just curious that’s it
yeah
Damnit, they updated Dead Cells again? Stop forcing me to come back.
If the knight was in fall guys I'd play it
mossbag, please get therapy, you need it
I got a strange feeling of deja-vu from the intro. Then I realised I am probably very dumb.
Blood cells ———> dead cells ———> hollow knight
He used the same fucking introduction
I am stuck in an infinite loop between the end cards of these two videos
I remember watching the Block with my family during dinner and I was so surprised when I heard Hollow Knight music. They all looked at me weird when I pointed it out, though.
yo mossbag uploads yay
very cool thank you mossbag
surprised you didn't mention shovel knight in rivals to aether
I didn't need a good video to spend my time, but it's cool nonetheless, thank you
Hey mossbag, love your videos! While we're on the topic of cameos, did you have a cameo in dunkey's 'America reacts to Mario cast"?  Link: https://youtu.be/HmZVrqi4Nw8 at 1:40?
are you kidding me this is the opposite of the other video what
wait what? 2 videos???
that owl house joke is just disney xD
These videos can be described as a downward spiral from an actual video idea
I can’t wait to tell every enemy I beat in Silksong to “git gud.”
I remember seeing a french cooking show which used the radiance theme. Funny thing to see.
sussy baka
The duality of man
4:55 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
For some reason all hollow knight music is owned by a small koran youtube channel with nothing to do with team cherry or hollow knight
Oh god Mossbag is going crazy
Ah, now I understand the opening of the other video lool 4D Chess
You are a master of finding obscure ferfrences it seems. I for one didn't get the giraffe one, and would have just glossed over it
Seeing that hollow knight made in "turma da mônica" as a brazilian is so damn cool
He talked about turma da monica, I can die happy now
As a brazillian, I'm very happy to see the knight in Turma da Mônica
mossbag saying "turma da monica" made my day
2 videos in same time !!!
what a master piece
Hollow Knight music appearing in The Block is actually a very sneaky reference to its setting, Australia! Supposedly, Australia isn't actually a fictional country but is in fact the country where Hollow Knight was created
So awesome
TURMA DA MONICA VAMO LAAAAAA BRASIL🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Bug fables has 2 other little references to hollowknight. The detector metal from bossrush looks very similar to the knight and the spot where the Berserker metal is hidden has a little nail.
I can't believe i just watched mossbag talk about the owl house
Mossbag is about to make the "Times I hallucinated Hollow Knight lore after I lost track of how many days have passed since Silksong was announced"
Very clever dual video release. Golf clap.
Hollow Knight
Now make a video about every jojo reference
What about all of the Hollow knight references in real life.. Sure are a lot of bugs out there
So THATS why you uploaded them at the same time
these two parrallel videos were done very well
De todas as referências que apareceram, eu não imaginava que o Mauricio de Souza gostava de Hollow Knight
Team Cherry needs to release Silksong already. This man is going insane.
12 minutes ago? gee golly im early
Here's Brasil!
Nice
Sheeee Wario looking thick       No but great video
bro i never realized how sick australia's copyright system is
First dislike
Tell the devs their marketing strategy worked I will now be buying Dead Cells  ...not because of Hollow Knight, but because I saw the game before and couldn’t find out it’s name lol
Guys, he’s lost it.
I love mossbag.
Yo what's up just casually commenting 8 minutes after the video came out, also I cannot freaking wait to use the pure nail in dead cells
there's actually a second hollow knight reference in bug fables! it's possible to find the knight's nail stuck in a rock at one point
Turma da Monica 🖤
What's the Knight's Ryu number?
Dont think he meant to upload two videos at the same time, gonna download the two to be sure
Mossbag works so hard for us. We should treasure these double uploads…
The guy really just posted 2 videos in 1 hour
i thought this was the same video than last one but he changed the title lmao
I mean dead cells and skull plays similarly soooooooo
Wow 2 mossbag videos in one day. Look at that.
In the next video we ask the question is mossbag okay?
Anyone else think this video might be a reference to hollow knight??
Let's gooo 2 Vids
thought you where gonna say there was a hollow knight reference in the bible
;-;
Epic Double Upload
Theres a refrence in forager to hollow knigth
This is a video I DID know I needed. Thanks @mossbag
Atleast mossbag makes more content about HK
The moment when shovel knight made it into shovel knight was absolute epic
It's not April 1st yet
Hell. Yeeaa.
I have no opinion on references! Remember when Wario was on SNL? Or that time Rick and Morty showed up in Space Jam 2? That was so neutral! I will remember that for an average amount of time.
I opened both new uploads in different tabs. Listened to the first sentence of this one then tabbed on to the other, now my sides are no longer attached to my body.
This guy posted a video just a second ago .. how are you still somewhat sane are you being driven by the madness yourself?!At this point only Silk song is Mossbags cure.
It’s crazy, I JUST watched another video with a super similar intro. I don’t remember where though.
mossbag just made a cameo twice in one day???? crazy edit: yoooooo I love bug fables, awesome to hear a mention of it
Damn you hit us with 2 videos? Didn't expect that
Whoa two new videos at  the same time
Mossbag you are a brilliant comedian
I think mossbag lost it
2 videos in a row? wow
Nice
god mossbag has blessed us today
Team Cherry needs to release silksong or we're gonna see mossbag in an asylum soon
mossbag ur so handsome i love you
Two viedos in one Day??!!
