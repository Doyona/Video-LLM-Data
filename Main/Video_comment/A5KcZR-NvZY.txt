Who wouldn't give up
Whos jack
this one math test we had a long term sub who didn’t teach shit and so he sat on his desk on his laptop or slept and wrote the pages we had to do and nobody actually did any of it and so we weren’t even meant to have a test anyway but we got told on like 3 days before the test we had it and so most ppl didn’t study but I studied a little? But anyways the day of the test came and the teacher just sat there and was reading a book so it was a good opportunity to cheat and so everyone started sharing answers,and my friend even bought her phone in class I copied some off her and some off other people,and the next day I got my test back and I failed even while cheating?? then it hit me;I cheated off a guy who even cheats in practice tests and another stupid friend so even while cheating I failed.  lesson learnt:only cheat when your smart friends are there
moral of the story if you're going to cheat..cheat good 😏✨️
does not cheating but helping others I'm test count
❤❤❤

Here is how I cheated, I leant braille and then engraved it onto my eraser because I had one of those big erasers so it all fit. Didn’t tell a soul and got a 50/50. Did my teacher find out, no. Was he suspicious, 100%
In science the test are hard so a lot of the kids cheat. A lot of them who cheat also fail. There isn't a way to get a good grade on these tests so they cheat.
Why do I have the same exact life as you? 😂
I was the smartest of all public school but now…      Still the average grade in charter school it’s real hard and fun
If u do dont don’t keep it to ur selfs….me oh ok me cheats on a test and tell someone….goes to the principles office…..aw man what the frick    This was a joke ok don’t tell this is a joke …….
That is hilarious how betrayed you would feel if your friend got the highest score even though you knew they cheated.
Stop the cap
One time in 5th grade i had to stay in fore recess cuz my math homework wasnt finished. She told the answers and i wrote it on a paper and i got them correct LOL

Im still 11 and i am one of the smart ones 😂
In 4th grade I was on the group of the smart kids which in it was me and my 4 friends.When we had the exam of the computer clash we didnt know anything.Then we were all in the same row.And then one of my friends took out the book and copied.But we didnt finish it cause school ended.And the next day we gave the teacher our exam but all of the class cheated of the book and even me and my friends.
That was me ones lol
I was (and still is) the smart kid and my class wasn’t really known for cheating so when I was in 3rd grade The person sitting next to me was copying me and they were begging me not to tell the teacher and I The idiot I was agreed and this went on for 6+ months until the teach found out We had to away sit from eachother (good he was annoying🙄) And his grades DROPPED TO THE FLOOR

That's me
This kinda happens to me today. My class was doing a “quiz” on my music teacher. When she showed the answer at the first second he swapped the false card with a true

After 5th grade my brain just didn’t work as a fast and I gave up too
I’ve only done it once, in 5th grade on a math test, I couldn’t remember something so I looked at in my desk in a “hidden” way, and got a good gredd
Imma be honest, I'm a freshman, and I've never cheated on a test. (Probably)

I'm failing science soooooo yeah I agree 👍
I never ever cheated and I never got anything under a C in my whole school life. (I’m in 9th grade.)

In my class I will be considered an kid who always get in the fight/jokester/smart kid
There's a girl in my math class who thinks she's smart I mean she is but... she ain't always right. The worst part is she once announced in class that she was the 1ST smartest and her friend Jacob is the 2nd smartest in the class. 🥴🤨🙄
This guy kinda looks like BENOFTHEWEEK
Broo I relate to this sooo much 😅
I’m the smartest kid in my grade because I’m in 3 grade because I do every  thing on a fifthgrade level
Are you from El Salvador cause your name I know español porque yo si soy de el salvador
U jest told us
So one time our teacher gave the answers to a test the the day before the test ok? So I copied them on a piece of paper ok and I got a %99 the highest grade in class %1 higher than the second highest
Parents “Stop Encouraging Them!!!” Me “ ya (taking notes) ya ya ok”
So trueee
Me and my friend Addely we used to help each other during during tests because sometimes I don’t know the answer and she didn’t sometimes she knew the answer sometimes I knew the answer and she didn’t so I would like help her because we were always next to each other and then I moved away for one year she got her back and now I can’t help her
I had a similar thing happens except it was a game of Kahoot

Imagine his teacher watches this video🤭
Thank you for telling me a way to cheat

I was the smartest kid in class and then I cheated people where in shock
All through elementary I was dumb but then randomly became smart
Me: *Cheats on a test*  My mom: *BELT TIME*
Nah you ain’t smart I was working on a da/ mid form asment for sience I was the first one to finish it and I got a 98 and it took 20 mins for anyone else to finish it only took me 6 mins to finish like29 somthing questions
I just pass my test i dont read tho
I can relate to this but.. It's time for me to tell a story...  Ok so I'm on grade 6 and i am on like the 3rd row of the classroom and there was my girl classmates with her other best friend and so the other day they were in trouble because they were so noisy so other teachers complained and then eventually the problem got found out by our teacher so the other girl was exchange by me and now I'm on the 1st row and now the 1st quarter grades came up and there was only 3 people with honors (im not included cuz i am dumb lol) and one of them was the girl on the group basically they're leader got into honors then the one beside me also got honors so now after a while we got a test coming up so i studied hard to get a good grade then the test was finally there so i got a decent grade so now we exchanged papers to check i got the paper of my classmates the one who got an honor (boy) so now when i checked his paper he got 25/40 so i was confused cuz he had the highest average grade out of all of us then after i gave back his paper so after that we would tell our score alphabetically so now it was his turn and i was confused cuz he said 38!!! And i was like huh?! Didn't he get a 25? Then the girl with honor had 25 as well which was sus then so i realized what they have done... So they have been cheating they have been changing there scores they wrong answers to the right ones and changing there scores so the boy with honors is letting the girl with honors copy so that's how i caught them cheating and yeah they did this in EVERY SUBJECT this went out and by now teacher haven't caught them yet so yeah...   This took me a while 😅
I don’t because I AM THE SMARTEST KID
I actually saw one of the smart students cheat on our mandarin test bro my teacher slapped him and embarrassed him in front of the class she also called his mother poor dude died that day☠️
Bro, in My class everyone is cheating literally everyone

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BsIa_LKojJI
I'm in 4th grade and I did it but it  was a long time ago  like  a few days ago it was times that was hard  but I also  got caught  by my partner

Yiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
No I had to help the smartest kid in class even though I thought I didn't know it but I guess I did
How did you get the answers
Keep it to yourself Him: tells everyone on YouTube
Me and my brother are smartest in the class
I will always be the smartest at math in my class!!!!!!!
Just like me
Haha
Someone cheated on an a test in my class. She told some people after. A boy and his friends decided to write a letter to the teacher. Teacher read letter and just told the person don’t do it again 💀😂
me to
I cheated once on a test too because I just put the paper with the answers inside of my desk and if the teacher was walking around then I would shove it deeper in my desk and then when she's not around me anymore I just take it out and start cheating again
“hah, i always did” so im kinda? the big brain of our class, and last year my english sucked, so i cheated on spelling tests
That was me in 1st grade and 2 grade
i had this when our smart friend was cheating on online class and my teacher can also tell by the glasses worn i looked closely and yeah the smart kid was cheating
His middle school teacher: So that's how that idiot got a good grade
Ok ur teacher is insane cus my teacher would never say who got the highest in the class or who got a 100 we just figured it out ourselves😂
Is it just me or my whole class can't read english? 𓆩🤣𓆪 𓆩🤣𓆪   I have ONE bff 👭 and shes like uhmuh am from cAnAdA 🇨🇦  And me and my twin bff are like  👁️👄👁️ uhm no ur not?
The smartest kid in my class is my best friend who sits with me. She puts everything down on paper and  tapes it to her jeans. Hasn't been caught for 4 years.
Boy you was not smart you dirty as he double hockey stick
Well you is not smart you dirty as it
So…sometimes u need to. I’m one of the smart kids, and just because I’m generally smart, doesn’t mean I don’t need to cheat a bit here or there
Normally that means the test is impossible
The only thing you can do in my class is look at others papers I haven’t bc you get a talk with the principal and every desk there’s a table
I was going a test the other day and the kid next to me was using google translate. I just watched him. He finally saw me watching and looked at me in horror. I laughed.
the 5th most smartest in the whole school cheated on a test and got 99% ON A FREAKING TEST
The hot cheeto girl: I'm a joke to you
Im the smart kid and i help my friend on the test🤷
Recently there was a test and everyone thought I was a topper and so smart but I literally cheated infront of everybody I mean everybody was cheating but I was literally cheating infront of the teacher and the boy I was sitting next I was like literally showing the work in my notebook that the test was of and literally I got more then the topper of our class who actually get 100 percent in exams. I dont know why I was proud
And then the father got arrested and the girl went to the hospital
Ele
I did it once. I’m not ashamed. Through I wish a chose a better back row seat cause it was right smack in front of the teachers view… didn’t get caught and that’s what matters.  😎😎😎

That was me i was looking at the papers 24/7 :cry:
My teachers dont do the highest grade thing cuz they think that it can make some students feel bad
It’s only a crime if you get caught
The smart kid: does work. Everyone else: worships him
Is it weird that I was the only one in my section who did not cheat on a test I literally saw them look into there textbooks on the test
yeah one of my friends she's a idiot I caught her 4k sus
yep
I am one of the smart kids of my class
The smartest kid is my friend so he let me show his scores and we got 40/40
Pov: you just watched a video about him saying he cries cause he had a B+

I’m gifted
Good idea
The teacher waching this: 👁👄👁
I cheat to
I have I saw her I didn't tell
i was the smart kid in 6th grade but i absolutely sucked at geography. because i am spanish, in the final geography exam one of the questions was to locate various different european countries and say their capitals, and i knew where most of the countries went but barely knew any capitals, and the kid in front of me was telling answers of that same question to the kid to my right, and i could clearly hear the capitals they mentioned and just wrote them in like i totally knew them.

If you like this comment you are a gigachad
My bestie and I are doing that
the class topper sits behind me and in our mathematics exam she was like "yo what's the answer to Sec-A Q5 3rd part?" (Yes i remember which one she asked it was just 3 weeks ago) And I was like "gurl you asking me the answer like I know I can't even solve the answer to the first question on the exam u so far away 👁️👄👁️"
One time I was struggling on a test so I got a paper with all the answers and hid it under my desk the I for some reason showed my friend and we cheated together but then after doing this a lot one day she told a group of her friends came up to me and said I’m gonna tell The teacher 😂     👇
never
I was in the same boat as you before lol
This wasnt a test but rather a important activity, our teacher wanted us to use adverbs, adjectives, verbs of emotion to (?) (idrr) and the mfs at the second row AT THE FRONT had their notebook at the floor scrolling with their socks just to find what verbs or shit to use. Me and the others at the front row were just holding in the laughter. They did this probably when the teacher went out. Jesus that was hilarious. "Guys you are so screwed if you get caught" they never got and we never told anybody because we werent teachers pets. The word probably got around or someone actually saw them. Someone from the like 5th rows knew about it lmao   Keep in mind the seats are like this        Teachs table -------             ------- door  -                      z Z  Z Z                the guy who knew somehow Z   Probably teacher spot  Man that was so hilarious
800k like
I cheated once and did not get caught
Same the smartest kid in classes siting next to me and we were doing a test and the question was *What is this 🥦* (Sorry it was a cauliflower I couldn't find the emoji) and get asked me *How do we spell cauliflower* and then I told the teacher and she didn't care because it's the smartest kid in class but then he kept asking me eventually I got annoyed and told him the answer but not the real answer. This kid is smart (right?). I told the answer was *c u l i f l o w e r* and real answer was *c a u i I f l o w e r* and he got a sad 19/20 while I got a 20/20 and I was so happy and then I said *Who's smart now huh WHO'S SMART NOW* because he told me *told me I would get a 20/20 on this and every test because I am so smart* so *I told him if I get 20/20 and you don't will you agree that iam smarter than you* and he said ok and that's what happened
im 7th grade , when our teacher gave out the test i was almost finishing until i saw something confusing to answer so i hid my phone in my bag and opened the dictionary and searched the word (it was PPE) and i got a full score. (it was the only number i was confused in)
me:casually doing the test and feeling proud cause i never cheated my seatmates:casually looking at my paper and asking me for the answer
i dont cheat on people the people cheats on me
I always jeep it to my self
And here's me not the smartest kid in the class BUT the smartest kid in the class cheats of my answers
In 3rd grade I was one of the top 3 kids in my class, me and the other kid thats also really smart(SUPRISINGLY MY BEST FRIEND)decided to cheat so we told each other the answers and were able to find out the right and the wrong ones. Then we basically got every answer right and we passed. LOL
Bro I am in 7 and also cheat ina my exam
Bro why is that happening to me
You’re basically like me back in my childhood.. I’d be called a nerd back then during elementary school but as I progressed, it started getting harder and I actually needed to cheat or get help.
I'm the only kid that's the smartest
im 4th grade and one time i cheated
Bruh Giving up at Year 7
i mean if you see the smartest kid cheating you know its gonna be bad for all of you
My school had book fairs. They also sold UV pens. I used one to cheat on my 5th grade mandarin test (maybe more than 1)
Same
What's the point of cheating if you know the answers in the paper-
I’m in 5th grade and there is a kid in my class who cheats on spelling tests
Jesus loves you
I ALWAYS chest on tests👍
One boy in my class thought I was smart cuz I sat in the back. Cuz the "smart kids" sat in the back with me-

I cheated on an arabic test once
I did his name was abraham
I cheated on a math test yesterday
That was me
is it just me or am I’m one of the only person that has never cheated
I am actually one of the smartest in class on my old school and one of the smartest which is not me we both got into an exam so in exams we like need to show answers in the screen (because it was online class) we need to show our answer together. So when i showed my answer the guy was waiting for my answer so yeah ... i tested him in the next question because he should show his answer first (he still waited for me but then showed his answer) and he got wrong xD i got perfect in that exam and he got 1 wrong because of that XD
My friend is the teachers pet
I was also the smart one but started to give up
Everyone says I’m the smartest kid in my class and one time, it was fifth grade, online school, we had a biology test, I’m trash at biology. It was the perfect opportunity so I just googled 3 of the answers and got a good grade, everyone looks so confused if they ask me if I’ve ever cheated on a test and say yes
Every one considers me smart… I check answers with someone else that is smart, and we compare from there. I only do that in reading😅
the smart way is to use an eraser so when a teacher gets sus of you u can erase it
L friend
Omg 😄
Yes
The first time I cheated was in 3rd grade with a friend, who other classmates would say their one of the smarter ones  And we sat at the back of the class, so no one even the teacher would noticed💀💀
Ayo? YOU DONT KNOW JACK? ANYMORE? YOU KNOW JACK? THE DUDE IN THE BOX? JACKBOX? now im ashamed of you
everyone was smart in the 6th grade cheating stories, and I got one… this is a literal grand heist. So, in math, for awhile, it was easy, then I just stopped caring, and that’s when it hit me. I was at risk of failing how bad it went, so I decided to do a heist with my less smart friend, and some other friend who was nearby and we noticed he needed some help. This teacher is mad respected, super nice, and bro literally became the assistant principal the next year, he’s a big deal. So we went in a STOLE a TEXTBOOK teachers copy, we made a grave mistake as it was one lesson off, so we needed a new one, we went back in and took a second, a writable one, like 4 of them. And on this one day, I had the luck of throwing up the previous day and calling in sick. Our other friend got caught cheating on this test, and my other friend almost did too, but luckily didn’t. I heard the teacher was checking all the bags. This boy threw his book in the bathroom and ran off, I still had mine and when I got back, easy 100%. I started using it for homework instead cause I started studying again for better grades. And homework is just boring. We later in the year, got question “I’ve been hearing you boys been cheating.” Our hearts stopped, we both were thinking ‘Who told?’ So we came up with an excuse “I don’t know Mr. *Blank* we didn’t cheat, we are literally failing!” Keep in mind this is at the time we weren’t starting to do good again. I looked over at my friend “You know anything about this? I don’t think he did anything, neither did I.” My friend agreed, and we barely got off, we soon had a code word when talking about this Math Book, “Batman” since it was just at the top of our minds at the time. The next year we stayed cautious, adopting a new code word. “God Book” Or “God” we also returned the textbook version, just saying. I threw mine away by sneaking it in with the trash, that was a crazy story, never cheating like that again. Yeah uh, don’t cheat, even though you can get away with it like I did. Also sorry for the long paragraph lol.
Me: *in history and write the dates of invasions* Me during the test:*gets really guilty and then scribbles on jt before that question* Me: 100% correct
Literally the same like bruh, waittttt are we TWINS
I cheated on my test today lmao:,)
You're not the only one
Well becaus i am stupid in ny religion class ironiclly i needed to cheat on A RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWER i got the 10/10 and i then became the 2nd best on school totally worth it
I remember I did this in elementary and me and my friends were gonna do the same thing then someone told the teacher that they cheated then I won because I had the highest points then everyone who knew looked at with attitude.
I remember in 8th grade I was a smart kid however everyone thought this other kid was smarter and the teachers were always like he could do anything in his life but I didn't get any attention however in 8th grade I was in this kids class for the first time I made better grades than him and he paid me TO DO HIS WORK🤣🤣
Yes I am the smartest person in my class and l did cheat gast one time
You’re kinda screwed when the smart kid in class cheats.
When i was in 2nd grade we graded each others tests and the person that graded me gave me 9/10 and after that i gave him 3/10
I am the smartest in class for 2 years and I sit next to a Person who keeps looking at my work💀💀
This is literally my life story
I’m the smartest in my class and I have never cheated becuase I’m to smart to cheat
I had this one history teacher that made their tests hard. But eventually everyone ended up starting to do better on them. So he made them harder because he thought people were cheating. The day that the teacher was giving us the first harder test was when one kid in my class got the answers from someone that had that class earlier in the day. And they got a 10/10 on the test. And everyone else got 2/10 or 3/10 on the test. And the teacher started talking about how good they did on the test. And how everyone else needs to try harder and study more. That kid was not very liked after that.
I only cheated once  And it was an elementary school spelling test 🤣  I think I got like a 9/10 or something like that
l cheated on 4grade test😂😂
Jorge it's me Mrs dinkelberg you cheated on that test 13 years ago I'm so ashamed of you the smartest kid in the class I'm telling your mother oh wait it's too late to do anything
As a smart kid in the I often do this to confuse my fellow friends.I maintain this disguise and get away from people seeing me as a smart kid.
I cheat all of my tests no one knew lol
i told my friend i cheated on heads up seven up he snitched but my teacher didnt believe him cause i was a good kid

A person in my class was the smartes and he wanted to cheat on a test i saw his answears on a paper and when the teacher hand our tests he put the paper with the answers in my desk and when the teacher controlled my desk he found the paper and almost gave me an f but the person who did it told the truth
If I passed I cheated.
I used to have a smartest girl in grade 3 but she couldn't spell something right on a spelling test so the teacher said like no led pencils because people been taking that answers and so she took out her  pencil and secretly well I was  just staring at her and she changed her answers and said she got 20 out of 20 and she only got a 19 out of 20
Who likes trains?
“I SEE THREW THE LIES OF THE SMARTER KIDS I DO NOT FEAR THE DARK SIDE LIKE U DO”
In 5th grade the smartest kid who was always the teacher’s pet gave answers to the person next to her. Someone told on them and the teachers had to rummage through garbage. Btw this garbage had dirty tissues, random pieces of paper, etc. they found the sticky note with the answers and got an F on the test. :)
Don’t cheat it could be the worst thing you’ve ever done but also the last thing you were ever do
I told the person next to me that I cheated but instead he cheated with me I usually just helped him pass
I was smart but I slowly started to give up
That was me
thAt happens to me in 5th grade
If i get a chance i will cheat
I was the same
Isn’t cheating, like, cheating or something?
My friend and I were smart and we add the school he look like he didn’t cheat but when we play PlayStation he told me I cheated in every class I didn’t cheat one time I straight a
My friends always had my back, giving answers
Oh do I have a story to tell basically in the first grade I was pretty sure is really smart and basically she had a cheat sheet under her desk and I am known for cheating and every time somebody was caught cheating in elementary school or first grade oh you’re so smart why would you do that anybody would be just called that but her she was actually smart and the teacher was shocked and disappointed and we could all see that she was about to ball her eyes out basically I got an 87 on that test and she got a zero and I cheated by the way because I was dyslexic and I couldn’t really finish
I mean who cares if you cheat be real how much did you learn in school do you use now
“well if you do then keep it to yourselves” lesson of the story
I cheated so many time in one of my grades I was failing and no one caught me at all
He means keep it to yourself
Nh my boys aint snitches
in 4th grade I was kind of like a teacher's pet and then prob the smartest boy in the class said that he hadn't studied so he said he was gonna cheat. I thought he was joking but then I saw him looking at the answers in an app (we were doing the test on our iPads) I was shocked and since I was just like 10 years old, so I snitched to the teacher and she said thank you. I remember that I felt like it was necessary because you shouldn't cheat. After  that we always did tests on paper which made It even harder to cheat. :)
I was in 3rd grade everytime I tried to cheat the students start covering everytime
Am one of the smartest but I decided to cheat on 7th grade too in German class, all I did was wrote the first letter of the line and it worked lol

Tanks for jour Edvice
Dude when your mom going to hear This she’s going to summon her belt
I was like you but in 7th grade it all started
You know when the smartest kid in the class is having trouble then you have no chance at finishing that test and getting a decent grade
Dude if you wrote the answers in a sheet of paper and hide it to use it to cheat, isn't really cheating because you wrote your own answer in it 👌
When you have a Test it's a free for all. Or one v one
If u cheat make sure u get at least one wrong so it’s not obvious
Our class brighters are a gang if cheaters
one time I did not know the answers so I red the answers right before and I wrote it down
Cheating is ileagal in England
The smartest kid in my like, i think 3rd or 4th grade class actually tried to copy my test TWICE no lie
Pro tip: Don’t cheat at all. It will ruin your whole career cause you didn’t study enough for your future
I was the kid who some how managed to pass the most important test with flying colors
Welp im glad i got some good friends, i tell them, they tell me. They didnt snitched at all
Ngl I’m just like him smart in elementary and middle school dum af In high school
When the when the first second third smartest in the class don't understand the test all of us doomed
I was an all A student until middle school
So There was this kid who was my friend, he always did the test then gave md the answers and let me pass it around when I was done- no one looked down on me or anything because most people in that class knew I was failing that class 💀💀
Funny enough that was me I was the smartest but I will cheat on all the tests
Dudde I did it at 6th class
In 7th grade you gave up? You gave up that early?!?!
Dude pretty sure disclosing grades is like against policy or something that’s disclosing a students grade without consent from anyone like there should be repercussion for this shit
“ you sit on a throne of lies “ 😂😂
Bru
Number 1 rule is don't tell anyone
be glad ur mom didn't found that kumon existed
Damn, cheating too eazy
I tried but I'm really dumb
I’m the smartest in my school(I’m in England) so date is 2.8.22 and on 1.9.22 i go into year 5 there is from foundation/reception-year 6
i once tried to cheat i was able to make the thing work but turns out that the questions that were on the test wasnt the one ibput on the cheatcode 💀💀💀💀💀
Get some answers wrong make it seem real
I did this in Spanish. In the middle of the year we got a new Spanish teacher and she had a q and a period and the next class she had a test and the person with the highest score got a get out of a test free card so my buddy in the previous before gave me all the answers but then I told my friends and it spread so when I got the pass I was given a lot of stink eyes lol
Better way to say the end   When you cheat you will only cheat yourself
Ngl I did the same when I headed into 6th grade I’m heading into 7th and honestly f0ck this
I also cheated once i  6th grade me and my fellow smart friend giving answer to each other and we are the top of the class LOL
Dont keep it to yourself OK
im confused cause if the kids who are dumb cheating because they write answer on a paper and HOW TO HELL ARE THEY DUMB IF THEY KNOW THE ANSWERS
Like in my school there are three blocks Kindergarten  Primary Secondary So in primary I was the teachers pet or the topper But slowly in secondary I started playing basketball and lost focus in my studies So now I'm not the topper but in the top 5🤣
So my friend I don't know his name I'll call him Becett he is the smartest one in my class so he never cheated

I was considered one of the smarter kids in elementary, but I'm getting demotivated in highschool because of online class and all of that, I feel bored not being able to see my friends physically, because they also make me motivated
Believe it or not I've been the smartest used to actually get A+ all fhe time like I actually never failed to get them then I passed to the best school in my country and I now barely scrape by moral of the story there's none
I'm good I got a 100 on my last math test 🙃

Parents:lIfE lEeSsOn
That is me the smartest kid in class
Yes. I was right in front of them and they asked the other class that had the test before us the answers.
I’m the smartest in my classes and I never cheat
Being the smart kid, I have to admit that I did cheat on a *small* test. It wasn't really worth much. I was so dumb that I didn't notice that LITERALLY EVERYONE saw but yeah. I got bullied for the entire month.  Btw this is the first time I told anyone about it. The fact still haunts me to this day.
What are you telling us to keep it’s your self because he said don’t don’t keep it to yourself no I’m just confused 😅
(mom please don't ground me if you see this)so the super smart kid used to sit right next to me and if I didn't know the answer I would ask him and he ONLY listened to me whether I told him to shut up, what the answer was, or to even give me his homework to copy. great grades mom was so proud
Random question, Do you have any tips for high school? I start in 3 weeks
Naw man the entire class cheats together in my 7th garde year 😂😂
In history I got the highest grade on a project and everyone didn’t believe until I showed them and that grade 250/250

When I was in middle school my friends and I cheat of each other's paper we were never caught even in exams now I'm in college but my new friends are just like my middle school friends 😀😃😄😁😆😅😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
*me wondering who is Jack*
Me, in 6th grade 2nd smartest in my class & almost always helps others in answering anything like in exam, test, assignments, projects, food, money, etc. (including literally giving them away for free/no exchange sometimes😉) So, one time before a test started, I was normally reviewing things & was so emerge in it that I literally forgot the time & the test was just about to start. I paniced, so I stuffed my stuff beside & under my chair. One of my classmates looking at my paper, clearly openly cheating, & asking for questions. Me, getting a little bothered couse he was really open. So, I tried my best to help him secretly while not getting caught & told him to lower his voice & just look. I never stopped him from doing it & even helped by moving the paper closer to see. (There were also others looking & taking notes😂) I let them do their thing silently nothing more, nothing less. After test, checking time & I got the highest score, think only got 8~6 incorrect that time. Then waiting for class to be dismissed for lunchtime, teacher already left. I got up just in time couse some of my classmates were fighting & knocked off my stuff including my chair😅. LUNCHTIME me silently cleaning up my stuff, other classmates already having lunch & rummer suddenly started spreading that I cheated literally in the entire school (Got news of it couse some even personally asked me if I really cheated). Then, later I got called at the office for cheating (The one who reported me was the guy who was open). The teacher then shouted at me saying I'm a disappointment, etc. For cheating & openly tore my paper in front of the other teachers to make me feel guilty😑. But, I was never guilty nor ashamed even once, couse I didn't even cheated... Well for myself😋. However, I didn't fight back to prove my innocence YET couse the last time I did that, my parents were called to the school😓. But~ thankfully this time, an angel 😇 teacher took pity & suggested that I retake the test again. Everyone agreed & so did I. XXm later, I prove my innocence but this time I got perfect score & was allowed to return to my class. It wasted my precious lunch time, I never gotten to eat anything, got my image ruined once again as always (it felt that all the ones I passed by judged me, couse they literally kept staring at me & whispering to themselves🥲) ah, I was almost late for the next test. Next test by the way also got the highest score😜. But... Because of it, I decided to never enter/be one the top 5 nor 10. & If possible not enter top 20 which is really hard but manageable couse my health also helped he lowering my grades, couse almost every month I always got confined in the hospital🙃.
97% of kid cheat
Not really but I got the highest grade in English which was a 92% and the two smartest kids got 88 and 81% and I felt disturbed but also happy at the same time 'cause I pasted with a   92%
OK I CHEATED AND WAS THE ONLY ONE WITH PERFECT SCORE IN MY CLASS I WROTE AWNSERS ON MY HAND AND WORE A GLOVE

Yeah this one time I was in class and it was about states and capitals and I was trash at those, so my friend beside me had a cheat sheet and I was like. "Hey can I have paper too"? Him: "wtf I'm distrusted with you". Me: "bro look at youself". He gave it and that was it.
Yea and also I have witnessed like 7 people cheat in the same test, it was history  and it was like the easiest history exam ever
I never actually saw anyone cheat on a test
That's literally me. I was as the nerdiest kid from kinder to 5th but after that, I gave up. Now I'm just a C and B student.

The biggest problem is: 1.I'm 7th grade 2. I am the "smart kid" of the class 3. I told my buddy that I will copy from them 🤣🤣
When I was in fourth grade I cheated 3 times
The one time I cheated was in kindergarten two of the smartest kids in class sat in front and the privacy board had a hole at the bottom so I looked just for a sticker that smelled

Well, kind of. I was that kid and I cheated on a french test. No one ever knew.  SNEAK LEVEL 100
I think i was in your school
Casually tell the whole internet
My 6th grade social studies teacher announced who got the highest grade in the class once and it's awkward because she will said so loud
It's always "I" isn't it?
I was the smartest kid an I never cheated on a test  we were learning like minus and plus and I knew division times
I had a Chinese test like... Last month... Me: *doing Chinese test on my laptop* The 2 smart kids: *do the chinese test in the class, chatting & cheating at the same time*  (After the test) My best friends: "omg can't you believe this? I heard the smart students in the class cheated on the Chinese test! Their Chinese scores are 80-90 in average. Crazy, isn't it?!" Me: "Damn wow 2 smart kids cheat? Idk how to react 💀"
Imagine the teacher is watching this lol 😂😂😂
That's nothing compared to my class a phone was literally flung across the classroom behind the teachers back just to cheat they were that desperate 🤣🤣
Dude same
I ve cheated 1000 times tru 9th and 8tg
It’s not cheating if you don’t get caught
I feel u man
Ok so in 5th grade me and this boy were top of the class. We sat next to each other , and there was a big test. He noticed I was struggling on a question ,and was like “Hey the answer is C” I was so confused until I realized he was helping me.
I was never the smartest in my class
no. i knew. she always did tests in the cabinet. i would say much more but i have shit grammar so no ones gonna understand
I was considered as one of the smartest students too until..we had to learn history. I would cheat everytime and get usually a C. I was the last student that has never got C. And i was a little too proud of it😬😬
Is it just me who has never cheated on a test 👀
Who’s jack
Ok so can we just take some time to think about why he didn’t specify why his classmates (specifically Mary 😂) didn’t snitch? 😆
I’m telling
Of course I know him, he’s me
Wait didnt you take the paper and right the answers on it how are you cheating
“ No one is ever smart, they’re only a good cheater “ - Sun Tzu Art of War
In 3rd grade i had a music test. I had the paper with answers on my chair and then i looked at my paper and I got everything correct
😳
I guess I am/was the smartest kid and if I'm stuck on a question, I'd ask literally anyone and they'd tell me the answer because everyone wanted/wants to befriend me
I was that kid
Im the 4th smartest kid in 5th period i dont cheat but my friend did but he did worse then he normaly does
What if your teacher is watching this
“D-don’t keep it to ur self” got me lol
legends say if you say max 3 times you will get pinned max max max
Bro for me it was my friend named miya and she cheated on I don’t know how many but she cheated on one and I was like bro really and after she said but I didn’t which was definitely a lie
How do you find the answers before the test?...
This is funny. I was the smartest person in my classes from 3-9th and I cheated like ALOT , but no one knew. Then one day we had an test in social studies and a kid saw me and he gave me the “fr dude?!” look.
I  probably passed kindergarten by cheating on all my tests. I was always seated next to the smartest kid in class so...
Yes
This is why in the UK you have to have a see through pen
I prob not gonna cheat in test
The smartest kid in my class just cheat yesterday in the test
cheating is allowed but just dont get caught - my art teacher

Bro this is me all the way

Is it just me is this relateble?
lol me and my friend would write down our answers on a sticky note and trade them when we were done with the test to check what we agreed on and what we didn't  and then we'd check who was right sometimes we still disagreed but this saved both of our grades many, many times.
I use invisible ink and I have never got caught sentence 5 grade I have be a straight A+ student  and when I graduate from high school I'm going to get my degree then I'm going to yell. I HAVE BE CHEATING ON TEST AND QUIZ SENTENCE 5 GRADE AND NO ONE NEW AT ALL.
I've only cheated once in kindergarten but that's it
My partner cheated to like that
I did well on answering questions and taking tests and all I did was pay attention. Shocking, I know
I've seen it
Bros room is decked out love to see it ✌🏽
Me too
I never told and then when my teacher said i’m the only student who got 100% Avryone looked at me my stomach felt empty i go5 goosebumps

I cheated once in 6th grade 😂,all the rooms had their own bathroom and i kept going to the bathroom like every 10-15 mins,and took out this huge piece of paper from under the bathroom sink,no one knew and i became the ace of the class
Yeah that is me they almost though up
The lesson is if you cheat don’t don’t keep it to yourself  So you tell everybody  It said DON’T keep it to yourself
#ck
I'm the same
The clip from Elf was my favorite part lol good use of the quote
the last day of school there was a test And I cheated
Me to
This is me in the 8th grade right now. Who tf introduced the alphabet to math???? 😭
I dunno it happens in the US or not but in my country the smart kids are their for one another Like in case of mcqs the answers gets passed to the entire class lol
bruh i literally did the same thing but in 6th 2 years ago (when i was also considered as the smart kid)
If the smart kid cheats i dont feel betrayed. U know the paper gonna be hard as getting through hell with 1 foot blindfolded
I do it all the time
This was me
Fr same
Same
Me and my bestie are the smartest in the class
i was always one of the smarter kids, but then i also found it to be more difficult during the later years. so i would cheat kinda often tbh, once one of my friends caught me and said “angelica..” and when i looked up at him he had this look of disbelief, i basically went “i’ll help you” and proceeded to help him
¥
Same grade when I cheat
Straight facts I went from getting A or B for math too failing miserably in the span of 4 years lmao
I sit next to the smartest kid in class
I cheated once and I'm smarted kid i did it by sneaking my phone on one answer in 1st grade
I have cheated in an exam so yeah
Ngl I was a nerd when I was younger but now I’m the complete opposite not even caring about tests and trying to have fun until I have to do important tests again
I'm starting to think I might turn into this.
🥸🔺
That was me😂
Never am the smart kid bro 😎😎😎😎
Me and my four or so other friends were the smartest in class and this one time we all decided to cheat together on a test so what we did were basically giving out signals to each other on the test and throwing paper that have yhe answer at each other...and when the marks came out we were cheering like monkeys when we'd top out the whole school on the test but we all got almost the same marks so the teacher said "something is fishy" so we were suddenly quiet it was so awkward
Bro this is so relatable
Who’s Jack
Pop
Yea no
I was in 4th grade and we had a big test. Then one of the kids named JJ he decided to take the study guide with him. Everyone saw him and they didn’t say anything. Well except for a few “tattle tales.” Then the teacher came over there and took the study guide from him. He had to stand on the wall at recess. Don’t cheat :)
Yea
Yes
Same i am getting dumber kg 2 to grade 3 man i got 17/30 in my quiz lol
Why is this soo relatable as a smart kid
I go to special science elementary school and i never cheat
Boo dee.5mo ago$9000000000000000000000000000000000
I am the smartest in my class, watching YouTube, playing roblox, and not studying too much and still being the smartest  My friends: studying for tests, playing a little bit, and trying to improve their grade and get 2/10 on a quiz lol
DO NOT DO WHAT HE DID IF YOUR DUME just give your best ok
Same but in the morning I always look at the "smart" kid u started that a couple weeks ago and me and my friend just guessed and we actually got it allll RIGHT
I wasn't the smartest person in my class by with the multiples in my classroom math you can give me a math question I slap that quicker than 5 seconds my whole class would like how did the man get an AIDS oh is he cheating but I never actually cheat on the test in my life so yeah but when I got a little in one grade called fourth grade I wasn't the smart ticket in my class for math because the kid I thought he was smarter but no he cheated cuz I saw him using
Me being there smart kid gives you the side eye
a friend who tells on you isnt a friend
He’s exposing himself
You sit on a thron of lies 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"cheating never gives any success" (only if you get caught)
I once told my good friend about my watch that could display messages on it and how I was gonna use it to cheat. He didn't tell anyone :)
Moral of the story: if a kid tells everyone you're cheating, beat the crap out of him
I spit out my food at the end cuss it was so 🤣
Nah my math class thought i was smart (im really not just do your work) and they saw me use my phone on a tests and started freaking out. Like bro here take the answers
Why is cheating considered bad
One time we were doing a math test you were only allowed a pencil and the test I looked over and the kid with STRAIGHT A’S WAS USING A CALCULATOR
I’m literal watching this while I’m doing a reading test at home
The fealing tho
Well in 4th grade I don't know if I'm considered smart or what, but anyway we are four people one is beside me the other 2 is behind me. We would cheat even when we're in front of the class and the teacher's desk. And we check our papers by switching to your desk mate then sometimes we erase it and change it to correct answers. ( I'm the one helping most of the time though, sometimes I don't give them the right answer I just say I don't know)(so that sometimes we have different answers)
How would you know what the questions where?
Does helping your friends count as cheating ?
I was also considered the smarter kid,but in 4th grade my cousin was in my class and we wanted to twin.So we would pass notes.Now I look back at it and that was my worst year.
I have a pen that has a paper inside and I just write in it I win
Ha ha
I was a smart kid till 7th grade my score didn't go down from 88% 89% i was always top 10 and we had big classes  and now i just got in 9th grade and my results was 42% i was Conditionally passesd
It's about normal avarge kid in class who got highest grade (and points) from three test that was in one week, the "smartest" kids almost cryed (we had 3 of them), im proud of myself, i made one of them cry and two others were rageing  XD (sorry for my bad english but it's not my primary language)
*Lesson learned: don’t tell nobody you cheated*
It's all fun in game until the smart kid said Damn 80% my mom is gonna whop me
I was the top 1 in class at 6th grade and one i would like play around ask my seatmate what's the answer to this number and yeah shed give and ofc the other way around too but one time the answers for our test was on the board so we copied it and some people got ratted out and i wasnt one of them cause who would ever suspect the smart kid? i ended up getting a perfect score without anyone knowing i cheated. (fyi i literally put the answer on a 1/4 paper and even made it so obvious by taking it out and suspiciously looking at it. nobody bothered to even look at me 😂)
We can't cheat this are the reason •the teachers walk everywhere  • if u been found cheating, the test is  same everywhere in my place and we will have to stop the test write a new one. The thing is everywhere in place will take a new test only if cheating. • last one the school gives supplies we can't use Ur supplies.
Horchata
People see me as a smart kid in class but in reality I just budget my class time wisely
I remember one time when I was in 5th grade I cheated on a math test and still failed it
3rd grade me: *smartest kid in class* 4th grade me: *not the smartest but smart...ish* 5th grade me: **barely passes** 6th grade me: *Nah with your grades, you ain't passin* .... **still barely passes**
Couple weeks ago I cheeted on the final test. My adrenaline was pumping

Not only I've seen a smart kid cheat, guess what?  Dude turned to me and asked me the answers.
jits a bad attitude, That's crazy
In elementary I almost got tempted to cheat but then my best friend who's the top 3 smartest in class would always say "Cheating is bad, god is watching" which scared me 😅
Yes I was that person
Smartest kid always cheats on a test The smartest kid on my class:  I AM THE KING OF CHEATS

Wdym?
ngl i relate to this...  so one of the kids in my class that doesn't exactly get the highest grades sits next to me now. he's always like "you're uber smart, can i copy?" and, frankly, i'm not actually smart. i get like B's max and he's not entirely bad, getting almost the same grades as me.  i recently revealed this to him and the look of betrayal was hilarious
🤯
I cheated on a test and someone I knew help me on  cheat on the test ya no one knows but yup
Nope I'm the smartest kid in class and i have NEVER cheated on a test. And I'm in second grade
I cheated in my math classtest today. I wrote a note in the notes feature of my calculator
Sameeee
Literally from smartest to dumbest student cheat in my class
Literally from smartest to dumbest student cheat in my class
Kneel before your superior
But sometimes it goes like this...  So when I was in the final semester at 6th grade, my homeroom teacher one day came in, and basically said that in the test, the class will ALL be cheating. So basically, the smart kids in class (me included) would be tasked to complete the exam as quick as possible and then take a small piece of paper and write all the answers to the exam there. Then, we'd be tasked to secretly hand them around to our friends behind us. Yes, our homeroom teacher tasked us to do that. What's funny is that she told us not to tell anyone lmao
When we had a test we're all just cheating 🤣🤣😂
I get all of the a grade without cheating bro this kid cheated on double digit numbers by using a calculator
I was the smartest kid same it was the worst
I just give my friendns the answer
I'm on the smartest persons in my class in math
I am the smartest kid in the class but..... you know
Bro my other lanuage teacher let us put away our paper to read the book again and me and my friend put thr book in the desk box thingy and we open it and copied from i and the teacher never notice not even once also we told everyone in the class even the teacher pet tries to tell teacher but sometime he dosent the teacher just hit him because he talk to much i thought he got caught
I definitely havent cheated on a test before 😀
Ok so there was this girl in my class ( in fourth grade) so we had round tables in our classroom and she sat at mine and so   all of the year she kept on looking at my answers to change hers and she got 100%s and I got like 90 and 95s I never told her I knew cause she was my teachers fav student and a teacher's pet she was the worst and yes she was the "smartest"
I was the same
Kinder grade I was the smartest kid and years go on I was hooked up with games bro I'm not smart now🤣
pov: you saw the smart kid looking shocked starting a test- 💀
One time me and my friend cheat on a test and the people in our front saw us and we found out they were also cheating and doing the same trick
Me not trying on a test guessing answers me getting a 100%
I usually never cheat but this one time I cheated on a practice test (my hindi teacher used to tell us to practice and write without seeing the next day) but this one girl caught and you know about girls they are very bad at keeping secrets and .... She told my teacher that I was cheating and I never cheated again after that incident (cuz iam a good boi)
I did that in grade 5 and 6 cuz it's online class and I was very distracted didn't get perfect score lol
we cheat together i dont mean  3 or 4 ppl i mean the whole class
Not gonna lie I helped some people cheat on a test in 3th grade and 5th grade and they got a good grade
this is happening to me currently
I’m the smartest kid in my class and I don’t cheat

For anyone in the UK 7th  grade is year 8 for us.
My whole class cheating except 2 or 3 persons regularly
But how did he cheat did he already have the paper in the pen or did he just make it because if he just made it than that's not cheating
You know you're the smartest kid in class when people ask you when class ends
Atleast he did this  ✌️✌️
On time the entire class cheated on a test it was so funny when half the kids got a 60 or 80   I cheated and got 100 somehow
Wtf why is he just like me

So today, I had a Spanish final. It was on a computer, and for some reason, google translate translated the whole test.
My classmate was the top student for kinda like 4 exams. She topped all the exams and was the first rank in the class but later we found out that she was cheating by exchanging papers and asking for answers and yup i didn't reveal anything to anybody but i losed respect for her. Even a new teacher graded her an excess 1 mark for  a 2 mark question and I saw it but kept shut up cause i didn't wanna ruin our friendship
Poor jack he forgot about him🥲😂
Y does this sound like me
My crush was smarter.     In school and his friend
One time , I was taking a test that was really really important and we studied for it and stuff then we did the REAL REAL REAL test that was really important so this one kid named Malachi said to me IF U DONT TALK I WONT GIVE YOU THE ANSWERS I was so quiet. Then he said number 2 is something and he was very very very wrong he got a very different answer than me so that’s why I don’t put the answers if someone tells me it’s the answer;-;
Bro this just happened today except it wasn't a test
I'm literally you
7th grade is always the worst bro
Pov: you were cheating in a biology test with your friend and one of your classmate" *Gets a C*
Class and I help each other cheat actually. Oh you don't know the answer? Morse code bitch do you know? It's either we send the answers to each other via morse code or we just point to our paper and pray to a God that the person that needs help can figure out where we're pointing
I am the smart kid and once I cheated with another kid and we passed notes of the answers and we got it right except one question that I got wrong and he passed me the right answer and I passed him the wrong one and we didn’t know at the time but when he got a B and I got an A that’s when it started…
Same bro in middle school i was the smartest kid
Kid named Andy changed his answers. Felt betrayed. But I ain't no snitch!
Well i did cheat in a test too (it was a music test) so i took out a paper with the stuff i needed some people saw me cheat the paper was kinda small the class did not tell the teacher some people dint give a fuck but soke people did look disgusted i got 2+  some people wanted to tell the teacher bcs i was the one with the 2th best class mate but the teacher dint pick them to this day some people still know it (it was in the 5th grad now im in the 7th grad sorry is i had alot of typos my from germany my english isnt really good ;-;)
So one day I had a Spanish test and I hadn't studied crap so what I did was take the answer sheet and pulled my sleeve down and rolled it up my arm so it's was rolled around my arm and the sleeve was covering it and everytime I had to look at the answer I had to act like I dropped my pen and I would slowly take out the answer sheet look at the answer,put it back under my sleeve and back up and pretend like nothing happend and I still failed lol 😅.
If I cheated I would order keychains with the answers in Japanese and learn those sed answers so that way the teacher wouldn't think that they where the answers unless they know what it means
Imagine your teacher comments on this😳😳😳
Me* All ways helping my classmates in my table I would kinda say I do most of the work but not always bc there is also someone that will help me with the stuff that I could not find out    One kid in my table* Him * Just chilling while everybody is copying me in my reading class* but do u think I care oh heck no I don’t really care as much as long as we get the work done ✅:)   :•
Smart kid:Cheates   teacher:Wow the smart kid is cheating for 2 years your Suspended for 1 year!

I am the smartest in my class (doesn't take much ngl) and I cheat on every test I can 😁
The truth about the smart kid...
I cheat in zoom
Story: so I was in 6th grade, this kid, I'll call him Bob, was pretty smart. He  always got good grades and never cheated. Well in science we take a TON of notes, and I'm not sure if this was the case for you, but we had unit test on all the notes. I finished mine as had science 3rd period. It was like 6th when I heard a rumor that "bob" had literally had his note book out on the test. He got a zero and could not retake. The thing is that this was the 1st time he cheated that I know of. Did he deserve the zero?
Once a smart kid had his notes out in a unit test for science. He got a 0 on it, probably his works major test grade.
I always cheat on the test that are hard for me but I just keep it in my desk and this one time I told my friend and she kept on telling me to give her the answers and I was like 😑😑 bruh so yeah

Once in 4th or 5th grade I thought that I would need a lil bit cheating but before the test my mind changed and I threw the chit and later during the test mam saw the chit on the floor and recognised my hand writing and so she called me and scolded me and as I topped the class always , everyone saw me with disgust and also that say my mom came to school for fee payment so my friends told her so I also got scolded from her but I am still unable to make them understand that I didn't cheated
Me yes
Don’t keep it to yourself-Jorge

Boi if u get test answers and u don’t have the sheet don’t u know the answers? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
😆
got it, I won’t keep it to myself
But then later they will tell the teacher that you cheated
Story time: Back in elementary, i was a pretty decent kid (not smart but not dumb) but there is this one kid that is super smart that every girl was simping on him. So one day there is a math bee (like a spelling bee but with math) and i was doing fine until the final questions which is the hard part but fortunately there was a tie between me and the smartest kid in class. We were told to take a bonus test and the result were shocking for me since i got a higher score but no one gave a fuck so i guess the lesson is: Don't try to brag even if you did good (but i didnt brag tho)
School cheats you harder than you cheat at them
I can relate with this
I never cheat
I didn’t cheat
I’m the smartest kid in my class
It is the worst thing when you have been studying from days and the student who has cheated gets more marks than you 😢
OK so let me tell you the story back when I first started school I was pretty smart but brothers got dumber and dumber and dumber is it worth it gone to online school district cheating I thought the Panthers on my phone and then display much
😅😅
Idk why my friend gave me the answerI sliently thanked her but I almost got caught bc my teacher walked past us😳😬😬😫
Story Time:On my spelling test I actually cheated on Q10 bc i'm the class monitor
Yes so much because in middle school my smartest cousin cheat on my test
You are one of my favorite YouTubers
I’ve never cheated on a test, I’m pretty dumb but very smart in other ways (that’s useless) anyways, I should start cheating now considering my grades are VERY bad and I’m failing GRADE 8 LIKE HOW??!?
In 3rd grade I was considered the dumber kid in class, not the sharpest tool in the shed yknow, so anyway we were taking a test and we had those folder things that you could put up to stop people from looking at your test, and the teacher would always say “make sure to check your answers” so I pulled out the study guide which had all the answers in it, and one of the smartest kid who sat next to me saw, and she asked “what are you doing” in that quick tone, and I replied “I’m checking my answers 😏” and then she wanted to see the study guide after that and I was just in shock, neither of us told anyone
My parents always say you only cheat yourself * meaning your accomplishments you don’t feel proud of because you know you didn’t earn them*
I'm sorry that you don't know Jack anymore, he seems like a good fellow
Yes
Bro if you write a cheat cheat during a test wouldn't you know the answers already?…😳😳
* pov he got a one*
Same man did you know that ther are more smart kids chiteng on a test more the oder students and its because of eggziyty
Honestly, same
Im in 7th grade right now  I have my annual exam in 9 days 😫
Damn that made me remember the teacher catching me made me 😞
I was one of the best students in elementary but in 2nd grade I was the teacher helper so she wanted me to hold some papers and I asked what one of the papers was for and she said not to look at it so when I went back to my site I wrote it down on a piece of paper then we had to pair up with someone in math.There we’re areas with math problems and the paper had the answer on it, once all of us answered the questions there were papers with A B C & D on them in the room, we had to go with to the one we picked but if you got it wrong you were out and the winner gets a prize, me and my friend got that prize and no one ever knew.
Or if you are doing the chunin
Yes with how good she was I still remember that
Now I Have A New Way To Cheat!
I put a paper of answers on my desk and the teacher saw. She just shrugged 😂   No— I’m kidding! I hid it on the chair.
Jsjsj
This happed the other day bro I saw one of the smartest kids in the class cheat I was offened
Broski horchata Soto is the funniest guy ever
Its me-
Let’s support this guy for supporting us to cheat even if it’s bad-
I remember when I was 7 or 8 I was the smartest in the grade and at the end of the school year they gave me a iPad for being the smartest
in my english class, almost everyone cheats. its just a general thing that nobody calls anyone else out for. it kinda feels like a secret alliance, especially in the front row. once it was on paper though, and while the teacher looked away a kid asked me for answers. i didnt have them either 😅🤣
Same bro I did that
Actually i have seen the smartest kid cheat on a test and he actually...   GOT CAUGHT!!! Ahem his excuse was that he wanted perfect grades
I cheat all the time on my test
I was considered smartest kid in class but instead of cheating, I just helped a buddy get 100
a student in my class wrote something on her arm to cheat on a test. she was so happy with herself that she didn't think twice before doing this - though it was a math test, she showed the english teacher how she was gonna cheat.  i still do not understand how she thought that was a good idea.
I mean I’m considered one of the smarter kids
I cheated in a test I always say can you help me to my friend he said no but he said he would  if I give him a piece of my candy
I never would cheat
Me to
The perfect way to cheat is to get some answers incorrectly and some right so the teacher thinks that your not cheating 😉
I've never cheated on a test
I can relate to the slowly giving up part, freshman year and I do my hw depending on my mood
I just found a new way to.... cheat
Death lied
WAHAHHAHAHA
Yes i have
Me
I "cheat" on a spelling test but in my mind because i remembered the words
He did that sign that means.you lied so he wasn't.one.of.the.smarter.kids💂💂💂💂💂💂💂💂💂💂💂💂💂💂💂💂
Same
With me I was slowly giving up
Ayo😳
Yes we were taking a test on the computer and he was using a Couculater
I never cheated and  90% of my grades were 1, 2s or 3s
Well, apparently This video is technically real, so back when 2 weeks ago, i having a social science test, the 4th question from all 5 other is so hard, i think so hard that my head heats up like dads on sport event, until i realize that i placed my phone at the Shelf underneath my desk, so i google the answer, many of my friend caught on my even tho im in the back seat, but noone tells the teacher, but when i got a good grade(well apparently my teacher Immidiately grade the test), i see the jealous face of my friend. And i absolutely feel bad for them who studied hard while the teacher isn't in class
Same
Me too bro and in 7th grade 😧😧😧
I am considered the smartest kid in the class and I'm the teachers favourite
Man imma cheat all the time now cause I don’t trust anyone man

The one thing l dont get when you get a sheet to copy how do you know answer and in class how do you not know   😅
I’m the smallest kids in the class
Don’t Cheat well if you keep it to yourself you’re supposed to say don’t cheat at all bro
Yes this kid got on a calculator on his computer and turned his brightness ton so know one would see lol
Yes the smartest person cheated 😳 life is a lie
“Don’t cheat, if you do DON’T GET CAUGHT.”     😂
The kids are real  ones
I'm the smartest math kid and on test level 4 math I got only 2 wrong (sorta) It was fraction but I did the other way around
Ok so I am also considered the smartest in my math class I was always asked by my table if they got a question right or if they needed help they would ask me and I’ve never cheated on a test and I don’t think I will maybe I will in high school ehh who knows I’m still only in 7th grade
Me to I was the same
Keep to urself. I was homeschooled so if I didn’t know I just opened another tab on my laptop and googled the answer then closed the tab before my mom could see :D
That’s me
Yea I have
I know multiplication in 2nd and I cheat a lot
Mine said the lowest
Many people use Ur pfp
So did you move away from jack or
I've never cheated on the test
I swear you look very very similar to coco from Tokyo revengers.
I’m still giving props to my friend who memorised her friends test that she already did and got full marks on
I didn’t realize your last name was Soto (is your mom a teacher cause one of my teachers is mrs Soto)
(;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`) 𝕨𝕙𝕪....
First brain and his name is Alan
That was me and i regret doing it. It was a language, i couldn't understand it LMFAO.
I'm so glad he worked in the Elf reference, the "you sit on a throne of lies" had me dying
That one thing that discourages you when your taking a test in elementary school: *If you pass we will have a pizza party, if you don’t.. no pizza* When that happened in 4th grade I got a 65% which is a D
When you played the E.L.F clip, I thought of "YoU sMelL lIkE bEeF aNd ChEeSe..."
the smartest student was a girl and we were allowed to bring notebooks as "scratch papers" but she wrote everything she keeps peeking on her bag and the teacher wanted to see what she was doing and she got caught so her parents were called and she cried
Dude, if everyone else is cheating THEY'RE in the wrong for being disgusted in you.
Early in the year this kid forgot to turn his volume off so it was so loud he was smart
Oh yeah, I was considered smart too and cheated on tests
Not me taking a whole CGP book out while doing a test and the faces of my classmates 👀 it was worth watching 😂✋
God loves you and I do too and he sent his son  Jesus to die on the cross for our sin.Give your life to Jesus before it’s to late. Jesus he is the way,the truth and the light.If you want to know how reply with how!!!!!!
I’m actually a girl but that’s my dad’s picture anyways when I was in kindergarten I had a positive office referrals and now that I’m in first grade I just give up
In my old school I used to study and work really hard and I always came top of the class. Now in my new school there is this girl in all of my classes who always got 100% on tests. I wondered how. One day, she moved seats and we are now on desks next to each other. She never writes during the test , she waits until answers are put on the board then writes them down. It makes me so angry because she is cheating but I told one of my friends and she said not to tell a teacher because that would be snitching.
That’s me
I cheat all the time and never gotten cought 😂
Facts
Nooo nooo noo nooo l saw mrbeast
If you cheat don,t get caught
This is true I was caught 2 times
Why is there so much cheating man, I get 100%-93% on all my tests in middle school and I don’t cheat, I don’t even study a ton, I just pay attention in class and am kinda the smartest kid in all of my classes ( sorry if that sounds like bragging ) but most people in my school would agree
...
Same bro
Wow great keep  it up
When i was like 3rd grade i have this one friend that is just- when we where playing soccer and i get to be the goolceper sp he said to me "if you lose where not gonna take care of you" and later the teacher was so mad cause he dint do his homework and my feeling wher like "thats what you get"
i showd my papel in my school
Just to say I,m the kid who took 8dollars from you I'm on my friends phone sike😹👍👍👍👍👍

Yes my bff
Bro 😎 this is me yesterday on my test 😆😆😆
Same
Yes
Wait but he said   "Don't keep it to ur self-"  Me: aight bet  (This a joke btw)
I cant NEVER forget the one time that im the smartes kid in the school and surely im TOP 1 of the best student  at one time i was shock when i dint see my name at the first it was the boy in my school i was so mad and then someone said (EEEYY JUST ACCEPT THAT YOUR A LOSER NOW!)  i respons in front of my classmates  i shouted (AT LEAST I MANAGE TO GET TO THE TOP 2 UNLIKE YOU!) and the whole class starting to say loudly (OHHHHHHHHHH!) THATS MY STORY
I am disgusted
well when i was in 6th grade I had a friend that is very smart, one day my class had a math test and he is the smartest in math, but when the teacher goes outside of the class  he  take out calculator and use it while hide it under the table, also i sit beside him.
Don’t cheat or you will get a good grade.
Use a slap bracelet
ur being me bc i do that now
Same 😂😂😂
Well one time i cheated and got an 100% proud
Lol in 2nd-5th grade I did the rapid learner program for really smart kids by z and was ahead of other kids in my learning material so in 6th grade I already learned how to do the stuff we were learning so in partner work the teacher would pair me with people who needed help and if 2 people needed help, I wouldn’t have to do the worksheet. I did a better job at teaching the kids than the teacher did so much do that like 5 people told me I should be a teacher but that will never happen
Bro same I’m still one of the smartest tho but it seems like I’m getting worse
I'm a 7th grader too
Im the smartest at being dumb, so I shouldn't cheat
Bruh
We felt betrayed when the smart kid was caught with drugs
We all had to do it and the boys always got you
If everyone was cheating, and no one got a 100, you are garbage at cheating.
Man when i was in kg 2 1 and grade 1 2 3 i was nailing my tests and getting straight a+
Ok
Your teacher in YouTube YOU LITTLE LIAR!
That kid who tells everyone you cheated must be an annoying kid
Me when in exam be like : Look at my pencil  because the answer for the question is there
Same but in 4th
Better cheat then repeat😗💅
I am also considered "smart" in class but honestly I am not that smart as everyone thinks of me in class
I was just thinking of doing the SAME thing (7th grade btw)
I'm also one of the smartest kid in my class and I am an backbencher too  But  I swear I have never cheated that's different that the teachers help me in exam  But I never cheated  Or did I 🤔🤔
Welp GIVE ME YOUR TEST IM FAILING
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHi
This is me rn but without cheating, used to be the top of my class, now slowly getting mid
I literally gave up on school now 😭
I am smart but I cheat after I realized the teacher just gets her stuff off the internet and I can just search up the name of the assignment and I get all the answers
I once missed a week of school, and my teacher handed me a test I needed to make up, that I knew NOTHING about. To this day, I still don't know how I passed. :/
lesson learnt: dont cheat or else everyone will hate you
In elemantary school I was the smart kid. But this year I just cant. They're a few classes which I cant just take the test.
I cheated in exam in  first grade
Yea it was me trying lol
If the smart kid cheated on a test i would just think this test must be impossible
Nah this literally me bro I was the smartest elementary kid then I slowly stopped trying as mucj
Man described me, smarter kid then took a downfall in 7th grade
Yeah tbh I be writing a copy of the study guide in my notes lol

I always want a horchata with a cheros for it to dip it in the horchata 😋😊
Yesterday my intire class cheated on a test (i also cheated) and im known as the "smart kid" but everyone was like "YES FINALLY HE ISNT THE NERD HE FINALLY BECAME ONE OF US" (i felt proud XD)
Same
I did the same thing
yes
I once saw my old best friend cheating in maths but we knew that because of the teacher then my friend was very angry about the situation and teacher told me (i don't really understand why well he was my best friend but his sister has the same age and is in the same class) teacher told me to go outside of the class with he and a table and 2 chair and i don't know why i agreed then we went outside and he told me he needed to go to the bathroom i said ok he went and i was there waiting like 20 minutes for him and what happened was that he closed the bathroom and then we had to call someone able to sneak there so luckily everything finished all right excepting my friend and maybe the boy who sneaked down the door cause i think my friend tried to kick him
I have never ever in my life cheated on a test in school and I don’t plan on doing it either have you
Moralof the story don't tell anyone you're cheating
I'm that kid
Ah yes cheating lot easier when your homeschooled just google everything and I’ve been homeschooled my whole life
YES
In my class there are a bunch of kids who gets a 95percent+ in the overall exams and i usually get 89-94percent and if i would be in the other section of my class then i would always place in the like top 3. It was pretty much a unspoken fact that 1 section(ours) has the best kids and the other section had the average to worst kids. Anyways what i wanted to say was that the top 5 kids had a group and they would always sit together/hang out together and they were like angles to the teachers cause they had no beef with anyone nor did anyone have any complains towards them. I was always jealous of them cause i would study my ass off and finish in top 10 so i gradually stopped studying and didn't really care about grades cause i was finishing in to 10 regardless i studied or not. Then i found out something.......  They had a group cause they cheated with eachother to get good grades and i was so pissed at first but then i also kinda felt proud that they cheated and weren't that smart so whenever i would see them cheating,i would just give them a knowing smirk cause i ain't no snitch. After that i started cheating more and more to the point that one time i literally tore all the pages of my maths notebook and folded them and hid them inside my underwear cause they checked our pockets before the exams. After that we had like 3 hours to do the exam and i filled 20percent of the exam i knew and them go to the washroom,memorize the formula,come back and solve the question,wait another half hour,rinse and repeat. I would've wrote the formulas on my hand if not the fact that the teacher who was the hardest to cheat around was in our class and sitting LITERALLY BEHIND ME. I almost had a heart attack many times he would just start staring at me getting suspicious. He was kinda new and it was his first time teaching our class and the impression he and the rest of the teachers had of me was that i was such a good boy cause in my 9 years of going to the same school,i was only called to the office regarding a complaint was 5-6 times cause whenever a teacher would sharply stare at me i would start to cry.... I wasn't acting or anything,it was just that the teachers had a aura of authority around them that scared me. Only this sir knew that i had a sort of mischievous side that i hid from all the teachers. He got suspicious and questioned me which i laughed off and the rest of class saying that i can and would NEVER cheat also helped. Anyways this is the story of how i got a 100percent on a math exam. I wanted to write something different but oh well it can't be helped....
What you said happen to me too
Sweats nervously
Ok I'm the smart guy in the equivalent of 12th grade rn. I had a really tough Spanish History exam which I hadn't studied for. I tried to copy the girl in front of me. These are some skills I need to develop, geez was it hard to do.
You can’t cheat on test at my schools the teacher make the test them selves and tell noone
if you do cheat DONT keep it to yourself turn yourself in to the local police station and go to jail for plagiarism
I littraly know those who copy in my class😂
My mom sees my calculator:YOUR GROUNDED FOR LIFE
“I got a pretty decent grade, alright” JUST TELL US WHAT YOU GOT
It’s not great being the best story time~ I was the smartest in my class and the best artists in my class and it was horrible because everyone would ask me for everything like hey can u draw me this Pokémon or can u draw me a dragon and nobody would leave me alone but the worst part was that in tests my friends would cheat off me and they would say that my drawings were ugly and I would get 100% all the time and As on my tests and if I had trouble or not knowing how to do tests they would panic or have a panic attack and I was the resource girl it was hard like if they needed something they would come to me hey *insert name* can I get a pencil or can I get a sticky not or paper and I would have the best homemade food and everyone asked for some and I had 3 full pencil cases/box’s of coloring stuff
I never work nor cheat its all talent
If you Chi-Town lines and unzoom I mean you'll be okay because cuz your teacher for me come see you so so what are you talkin about when you when we can see you
I cheat always and they now  I was a very smart 🤓 kid and I'ddnt exposed once 😁😁
Same but i did absolutly nothing
🤣😂👋✌️
OMG fr I’m a smart and good kid in class and when ever I do something no bad or my name goes on the bad side of the board everyone is shocked and looks at me😳
I have a totally copy of your
Everyone please repent and spread the gospel, cause Jesus died on the cross for you so please dont waste it and be prepared because Jesus is coming soon. Have a blessed day
Actually if smarter people cheat it's harder to catch even in online, he won't just randomly write the text in google
I don’t judge you because I can relate, it just gets hard to put in the effort
it the meme for me 😂🤣
relatable. my class is a joke and were having fun lmao
ok
Story time:I was one of the smartest kids BUT when we in 5th grade had a test and I didn't study for it but I had a paper with answers that we were supposed to throw away but I forgot to do it so I cheated and the guy sitting next to me was looking at me and I could see the betrayal in his eyes🤣
I have only cheated once on urdu imla
I used to be known as the really smart kid in all my classes. idk if it was because I was quiet or something, but everyone would ask me for help on assignments lol. But they never knew that I sometimes cheated on math tests lol
I hate it when there’s a kid in class that’s always bragging about being the smartest when in reality his grades are pretty bad
Same top 3
Kids in other countries: cheats at least once Asian kids: cowers in fear during exam
it's not a mistake✨ITS A MASTERPIECE✨
I have the same childhood I am in grade seven rn
Bruh I cheated today just by writing with a pencil the answers on the table and erasing them acter
So true
I remember when I was good kid then I transformed to a usual one and my friends always loved to sit beside only in exams I I questoined this I my class for some reason didn't do anything when I cheated they were happy because now I left them to cheat and after all I got bad marks in french
I feel like every smart student has done this at least once. Last year, I was form one, and so it was a new experience to the exams, and it was online. I really did tried to study but I was so lazy. So I put my laptop on the kitchen table, and put the subject's text book right next to it😭 I felt really bad since I was the smartest student, but now I'm in an all special smart class and I didn't want to get kicked out
UH UH UHH I DIDNT I PRIMISE !!!!
happend to me last week smart kid chaeted
His laugh is what makes the whole thing fun 😂😂
I don t cheat but i write papers during the test And send IT to other students who have problems with the test
1 rule I learned it's not cheating unless you get caught
Once in history we had a geography quiz and I just used the teacher’s globe when they weren’t looking
Last year in 6th grade litteraly EVERYONE was cheating on a biology exam including me my smart friend,my friend sitting behind me even the smart kid I got an 5 (Like an A in my country)while the smart kid got a 4(like an B)
I was considered a quiet, smart kid but math ended that. I couldn’t understand it anymore and I had to cheat, some of the other students found out but did say anything. I avoided them after that
I love the movie elf
Who said cheating was betraying  my wacko friends I cheat by giving them notes im basically the most liked smartass in the class for being a wacko myself when they want answers I give them close hints which are easy to understand
You do not have good advice towards kids
This is literally me
That is what exactly happened to me the test just got harder and I was tired of studying I only did it once and It became a national boxing arena
Cheated the same way, it’s really easy to get away with
Teachers say try your best and u fail they get annoyed but if you cheat because you dont know it they think your smart your not cheating yourself you might as fell get a good score than failing im not saying dont try but still
Ahh yes highschooler advice. “Don’t cheat, and if you do, keep it to yourself”. 😂 issue. I’m in online school rn…
Same I was one of the smarter kids, now I’m struggling quite a bit to get past this year, and I almost failed the last year.
If you cheat always get 2 or 3 erong
I only cheated 1 time in a test lol 😂
True, and it will 99% work if ur at the back seat
We have to sign our tests to show we don’t cheat
This is true tho, but my version is just that im dumb the dumb in every subject (except English) on elementary, all schools mom always say "be like (insert their name), because they got the top rank" after the results came out (asian might related this), so i was doing my math test, i saw one girl who's ONE OF THE MOST SMART GIRL in my grade and she actually cheat on the class, after class because i was dumb enough even tell to front of her face "so you cheat the whole time?", And she said "yes, i will get to better school with good grade" i was shock that i have to tell to my best friend and they said "well duh everyone cheat, i did cheat once on science". I swear on that day i feel so betrayed because my mom keep comparing me to every smart student in my grade, even tho i tell her they all cheated on every test after i discover all of that, she would just say "and why you don't? Oh ya because they're too smart to even cheat, you're just dumb and keep getting C"💀💀
And don’t break the outlet it stops the test but not for long
In 5th grade two people used to get highest grades in almost every subject but one of them used to study and one of them used to cheat from the person who studied,  they used to sit together because of roll no. 😂 , and one was a girl and one was a boy (the boy used to cheat)
Yeah i keep it to myself even my bestie will tattle
My whole class cheats and they airdrop the answers, my class are the real ones 😂
No snitching boi
I was one of the smarter ones in my class too, but in 6th I would sit by this other kid and when we took test In literacy, I would peak at his paper and write down things in my own words. I
he ain’t your boy if he tells everyone
Bruh I cheat on like every test other than science💀
Wayt i soo you
Your class is 10x better than mine i would be snitches on instantly 💀
him: “if you cheat just keep it to yourself” also him: shares this to the whole world
Cheating is a art 🎨.  Your cheating when no one know that your cheating that is the art
I was not the smartest, but I was the rule-worm. One day my teacher said “here you go a pack of chocolates. Give one chocolate to each one of them, it’s because your so good” I was surprised
I have a question so if you put the answers on a piece of paper why do you need to bring the answers to school and sneak them in because you already know the answers
The smartest kid in my old class sat next to me, in a test she cheated by copying my text💀💀
It’s not cheating unless you get caught
You wont learn by cheating
I did cheat by going on Google for a math test but my friend got suspicious and he said that I cheated but the only reason was because I got 1 more point than him but I got everbody to think I didn't so yay
Honestly we kinda never see smart kids cheat probably because they hide it so well.
Same
The smartest kid is the one who cheats. Because, if you think about it, 90% of the stuff taught in school has no use to us, and even if we need any info we can just whip out our phone. This is best demonstrated by the fact that sooooo many successful adults actually score below 50% on the are you smarter than a 5th grader test
I am the smartest in my class
I just keep it my self:)
At grade 3 at English session we were learning action verbs then I said a new word "smacking" and the teacher said good job Kayla then the next the the smart kid told smacking to the teacher and the teacher said very good job Lilly. My mind: OI BISH OUTTA WAY IMA QUIET KID YO GET MUCH ATTENTION. I was like a really jealous kid at grade 3 I got to jealous and punched that kid poor Lilly
Ayo so I cheated on one exam so the next day my sir called me I was totally scared because I always fail that class so he said that I scored the highest and I cheated only the last answer not anything else so I relieved my secret !
We had a test like 1 week ago. everyone cheated, EVEN THE SMART KIDS AND THE GIRLS (the girls in our class usually never cheat). And the best part bout that ,is that we were all joking about it while the principal was in our class (we were loud af) and he didn’t snicht. He is always pretty chill, but that chill?!
Man whoever jack was really carried soto through school in his early years
i just realized ur the horchata guy
I’m about to bc we have to write down 72 words and if u write 46 that’s only 66% of your average
Sorry but I cheat on almost every test in class ones my teacher got me But I still do it
Betrayed 100+
No because I'm the smartest kid on my teacher
I was actually one of the smartest kids but not now
one time i didn’t pay attention in school and used to skip a lot during the marking period and didn’t do my work and i got a bad grade in the test and the teacher said the highest and the lowest grades
Him : don't cheat or don't keep it to yourself Also him : *giving cheaters ideas* "Smart" move.
I’m the “smart” kid and I cheated on a test my friend saw and after was like “dang u can’t do it on ur own?”
How did nobody snitch on you? My class is full of snitches
Yes
I fell for the same one. I sat in detention for A MONTH!!
If u do cheat. Keep it to yourself.
Same with me bro
You know it's weird because in our class we used to sit with students older than us for the exam so that we wouldn't cheat but they would help us too
Its not a mistake ✨ its a masterpiece ✨
Good thing that didn't happened to me😅
Me Ril lol I love this pfft
I used to be one of the smartest in my classes but once lockdown happened I started to realize that it’s passing the classes that matters and not the education
I always got assigned sitting next too the smart kid than they moved me and my grade dropped so low
I have a test on friday
I was the smartest kid back in like 4th and 5th grade and only cheated once. I checked the teachers lesson plans 🤣
You know what's funny, I cheated on a test today and now I feel really betrayed although there was one kid in my class you thankfully is my best friend and I told her that I had a cheat sheet and she didn't tell anyone
I was that kid who cheated in 7th grade (I'm in 7th grade now) I got an A and didnt get caught still guilty 😅
Me I did when I was the smartest girl in the class
Me I did
Sit on a throne of lies just hits different
You guys dont have memory aids we do well where I live in Canada a memory aid is for math you can right anything you want on it that could help you
Unless it was very hard then we cheat
Everyone was smart in my class
Nah
Omg I am called like the smartest person in class but I used to be horrible at spellings so I used to always cheat by writing on my hand or my wrist or having a sheet of paper on my lap but I was never caught and I used to always be very happy when I got the score looking back now idk y I felt so proud and happy bc it’s better to work hard than to cheat it gives u a great feeling of proudness and I will never cheat again
Well in 3rd grade we were doing final exams and wheen gk exam came I was like "oh no I did not rlly learn that much in gk" soo I did the paper But there was one question I did not knew so my friend was sitting right infront of me and I be.like "yo dude if you tell me the answer of this question I will give you 2 riyals"and he be like "ugh fine it's option 2"
I remember once in 8th grade we had a math test and we sat in groups of 4, me and this other kid were decently good at math and the other 2 were kinda stupid, but together all 4 of us ended up helping each other by switching papers to each other and doing each other’s work when the teacher wasn’t looking, at some point the teacher started walking around the class and to avoid being caught 2 of us threw the papers at each other under the desk and acted like we just dropped them and didn’t get caught, to this day I’m still surprised we pulled it off
It's better than the time I got send to the office for cheating because the teacher cought me looking at a piece of paper when in reality it was a drawing I had done and it was looking for ways of improving it
That's me slowing af i was the smartest when I entered school rn I am still the smartest but I am to lazy to use my mind
I did to and it was not fun I told my Nabor and she yelled it out like a month ago I'm in fifth grade
Asian Mom: u got da lou grade U no us fone  Me: (knowing that i wont be able to go to class)  Amom: wat da heil rong witchu da teecha sed u missed all da class  Me: you said i cant use my phone😎
Same
BRO WE ARE THE EXACT SAME. I am in 7th grade and I am considered the smart kid and I was for a while until I started to lose the grip and I used a calculator and someone said "I thought you were the smart kid?"
I was considered the smartest kid in class and when I cheated with the help of my friend who was the second smartest. I ended up getting a worse score than I would have if I didn’t cheat
I saw this too late I cheated on a test but almost my whole class did
it's not a mistake it's a masterpiece
it's not a mistake it's a masterpiece
it's not a mistake it's a masterpiece ✨
Too easy
“It’s not cheating if you don’t get caught” -My dad   He’s joking btw
yep
Bro I'm one of the smartest one's in my class and I don't cheat
That was me
I’m alredy giving up in 2nd grade lol
Once I was taking a picture and smart kid was behind me and thought I was taking a picture with him but his work and turned the photo upsidedown
Cheating is fun
I am like the smartest kid in class at least considered
I’m in third grade Me in first grade 😮
cheating is a talent manily infront of teacher 😂😂
POV: smart kid has only 1 cheating experience and it scared them half too death
I did the same but with the long. Sleeve and put lil paper under it 😅😅🤣
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
It’s not a mistake it’s a masterpiece
I got caught last week but that was the only time💅🤣🤣🤣
Gx
Easy cheats in online school
I could tell cause u must be a real freakin goofey to rock that kind of hair style, sorry bro just being honest
I can relate, i was always second to the best. And the 3rd smartest student on our class cheats with her homies. They cheat using signs.  I noticed it because their actions were pretty repetitive
I once helped the smartest kid in class cheat in the test
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I also was the smartest in the class but slowly degrading is my brain
They cheated off of MY test
Same
My friend called Colby cheats and he's in gates
Am a the only one who watched the elf movie 100 times
Easy thing when everybody cheats you don't need to hide it
Yes
Where I'm from they don't say who has the best grade we only know who has a good grade if we say it to each other
Thank god nobody cares in my clasa
I am that smart kid
Ah yes the friend that betrays u
I cheat a lot *laugh
I was in class one time and someone caught me cheating and she shouted to miss and i said nooooooo miss shes lying i asked everyone "have u ever seen me cheated" " i pass all my tests u expect me to cheat?"and everyone agreed and miss left me alone, and 2 yrs later i told everyone, that i actually cheated and the girl who snitched was like I KNEW IT ,everyone was suprised but they laughed it off.
That’s a cool pen
Same I was one of the smarter kids for like 6-10 years old and almost slipped a grade and people were calling me "THE CALCULATOR"only till 5th grade tho I mean I'm still pretty good at math but I don't use the teachers shitty methods and do the things 3x faster but "ITS NOT WORKING YOU MUST USE THE NORMAL METHOD" yeah fuck this For other stuff I'm pretty average. Btw I'm  Called the English god by the class cause I speak "perfect English" even tho I'm just average but that's probably cause I live in  france and cause I am french. ( seventh grader logic don't question it ) anyways bye
That is what is happening to me right know
When I was in 2nd grade I got the best grades but I'm in 8th grade annnnnnnd.
I am the worst algebra student in my entire freaking school
Where as in my class all the boys cheat together. we all write the answers the teacher says may come on the test and we all write two or three each and take it to the exam if the slip you got was in the exam you write it quickly and pass it to another person.
"Ayo 😳"
Why were you bored let me guess name now I guess 1988 it’s 70418 eight
Do you want to ship and
This happened to me in 2nd or 3rd grade and he got caught
If you see the smart kid cheat in class, you are all fucked
Same but this all happened when I got in middle school. I was a straight A student in elementary I was the perfect”girl” but middle school- DAYUM IT IS HARD
Umm, I'm the smart kid, and every kid knows when test is hard
@ was
The “teachers pet intelligent girl” cheated off my friends geography test  My friend is the anime girl that gets As but you have no idea how cuz she legit doesn’t understand anything  It says a lot about the smart girl
"ITS NOT A MISTAKE. ITS A MASTERPICE"
That Smartkid cheating was me  and my 2 friends saw me and they were like ohhhhhouuuu.and l was like l dropped my eraser in my backpack ...okk😑😂 I was looking into my book in my backpack.
Hi I love your videos😁
Who here loves bts (this is just random ik)
I was a literal nerd now I am failing my exams tests assigments
Well, I was not a smarter kid. All of the kids say I had the cowgirl talk. Anyway. But, I cheated in 4th grade. And had a little paper inside my shirt. But I secretly was looking at the paper. Then a find my Best Friend cheating off my paper. WTF
Their is a boy who sits by my friend in class and he told her that he was going to cheat. She told him that he was going to get caught and so later after class she told the teacher and he ended up getting a 0 and having to retake the test.
The top one girl in my class just gave me the answer's to the exam XD what a lucky moment
Ayo😳
My class: Hey did you cheat  Me:no The class: fk u nerd
No I have never seen my bestfriend cheat on a test
I'm 12 and The smart kid and once or twice yk 😉🤫 I used my notebook 😂
I was the smartest kid in the class but I cheated so many times I don't know why 😂😂😂
Umm i am the smartest kir but I cheated once
Same

Shorts always make my day better🤗
'Don't keep cheating to yourself' got it
I was the smart kid too and at a test i cheated and some classmates knew but they didn't say anything(i got an A)😂
I had a maths test she cut my half marks ( i got 29½/30) i was confused since all my maths sum were correct that's when i noticed a small red mark circling a l i told the teacher and she said i ducted you marks cause it just doesn't look like an l ( she was a pregnant)
Every person ever has cheated on a test
Dude I was so smart back then
Once in second grade I felt like the tests were going way too fast and at one point I was like "fuck this imma cheat" so I grabbed  a small paper from my math folder which was basically a answer sheet written by me so I slid that under my legs then acted like I was having a hard time so it would look normal for me to look down and I thought I was really sneaky (btw I had assigned seats and I got paired with my best friend and we would never eat out one another) but my best friend needed help so he raised his hand and I thought I was very sneaky and I had the nerve to look at my cheat sheet while my teacher was like 2 feet away from me  In the end my teacher didn't tell my parents or confront me so I guess it ended up good
https://youtube.com/shorts/QBwFBWBcPGc?feature=share
im pretty sure that in the 3rd grade, i tried to get the answer sheet. and the teacher caught me and EVERYONE turned to me. plus i was in the back next to the teacher- 😭 i felt so embarrassed-
I feel 7th grade is the year of cheating, I only know of a few people in my class that didn't cheat a single time in 7th grade
Lesson of the is… “don’t don’t Keep it your self” lol 😂
I  cheated on the US test and still failed hard
En clase, generalmente soy uno de los niños más inteligentes y está este "niño más inteligente" y todo el tiempo hacíamos una pregunta y se equivocaba, comenzaba a cambiar lentamente su respuesta para poder hacerlo bien.  (in class i usually one of the smarter children and theres this "smartest kid" and everything time we would do a question and he got it wrong he would start tp slowly change his answer so he can get it right)
Same
Kinda unrelated but I always ace my history tests (easy class) and I sit next to these two guys and one day one of them asked me how I do in on tests and I accidentally said "depends" and he took it as, "she fails tests". Man was not sneaky about this at all, turned to his friend and 'whispered' to them "don't cheat of her, she doesn't do good".    We do our tests on our phones (except the 9 weeks exam) They can't even cheat off of me anyway.
I'm pretty much the Asian kid of my class. Good grades, good rep and all that jazz. And I would keep this up until highscool started and the tests started to overwhelm me. Now with with all the expectations of my parents, teachers friends and classmates I was pretty much having a panic attack before every exam. So I thought that if I just got away with cheating on one of the tests that played a part of my final grade, then i would be alright. I got away with it, but the sheer amount of fear and anxity I got from that test still shocks me till this day
Ayo😳
I am that kid
I use calculator
Me sometimes I'm the smart one
So before the pandemic our school had this blended type of learning it was a mix of online and face to face. We basically have 2 exams for each subject, one for online and one for f2f. The contents of both are different but the online exams were the same every year, I would always cheat on the online exam cause I just couldn't be bothered to study for that, I would cheat by getting the copy of correct answers from the previous years and just focus on the face to face exams.
Ayo 😳
6th grade was so easy but horrible teacher yelled at me all the time but I had like the best grades
Breh you guys study bro I don’t I get 100% every time straight A’s lol so basically I teach someone about like more kinda math right it was in 2nd he was doing bad in it and now he even got good grades in it but not better than mine but I never study and I’m the smartest I never cheated
Yes. I’m the smartest in my class… NO ONE IN MY MATH CLASS KNOWS HOW TO TIMES NUMBERS TOGETHER ITS THAT BAD (14yrs old)  And thus I was bored and cheated and my bestie caught me 😊
My brother cheated on a test in 8th grade. So basically he cut a small hole in an eraser and then hid the answers in the eraser and put the cut portion on top. His friend also was in on this. then his friend behind him asked the teacher for a tissue and while the teacher had her back turned his friend passed the eraser to him under the desk. If he didn’t cheat he would not pass 😂
the teacher watching this:  *hold up w h a t*
Its not a mistake its a masterpiece✨
Its not a mistake its a masterpiece✨
I put my text book under the table when exam cuz my teacher dont come to students table cuz covid
I was always considered pretty smart especially in 6th grade when my teacher handed out graphs showing how we did in tests and I was the only one with 100% on all of them but the thing is I never studied or did my homework and I would simply guess the answers most of the time. I remember one of my teachers showed me another graph showing where I am based on the mapM/R tests and I was all the way in the blue section which is above average. It’s not my fault if my luck skill is maxed out bro 🤷🏻‍♀️ I loved rubbing it in peoples faces sometimes even if I knew I was a fraud.
Same here
Like one of my friends was cheating on a pop quiz when one of the other kids say the right answer she changes the answer and i look at her  and i am ashamed and sad i am un shockthen the teacher asks dos you get it right to my friend and she say yes my friend wins and i look at her and she smiles i was like nah Man i didn't say nothing
Oh ho ho you sneaky bababoi
Funny story really quick so anytime I have a science test and we had notes so I left my notes on my desk and the teacher was constantly walking around and she never saw my notes and I got a high B+ it was so funny 😂
My biggest flex is i have never cheated on a test and I have pretty good grades 😌 the last test we did I got 99%
Im possibly one of the smartest kids in my class and not meaning to brag but i didnt even need to srudy for tests and got usually over 90 🤣🤣🤣
WHY IS THE THRONE OF LIES GOT ME DIEING DEING DEING OF LAUGHTER🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Yes like why
"Its not a mistake"⚡"Its a Masterpiece"⚡
legit legit legit 100% relatable  one of the smartest in the school in primary school you get to high school depression kicks in and you spiral
-💁🏻‍♀️story time ig- So I'm in a big class, my class is the only one that's big idk why🥸 But anyways so I never ever study for a test cause it's a waste of time yk like sleep's more important 🤦🏻‍♀️ But I always end up getting high grades in my classes, and I sometimes want to help ppl in my class cause everyone either got like a 50 or 12 ikr💀 but the thing is I struggle talking to ppl💁🏻‍♀️ anyway so alot of ppl in my class think that I'm smart an that I'm chill🥸but I'm not and the thing is I search up the answers for my science hw and for math HW I just give my friend it and she does it but I only give it to her when she asked cause 💀I HATE asking ppl for help like I can't but yeah😕 💁🏻‍♀️Still thinking on whether or not if I should help my crush with his hw but idk😭

I like my profile picture
Bro even if I wanted to cheat I can’t my school is strict
When I’m Taking spelling tests before I take it when im studying I write the words on my desk
I have never ever cheated on a test and I am in fifth grade
Same
I just realized… I’ve never cheated on a test in my god dang life xD I’m not even smart either
Thats me...
So I’m the teachers pet and I seem to be “SmArT” to others. I didn’t cheat on a test , HOWEVER… we were playing the kingdom game . And I would grab the ice cream card (the one that lets you WAYYY in the lead) and hid it up my sleeve.. when it was my turn I pulled it out of my sleeve while everyone was distracted by the teacher saying that “Skip stations unless your playing a board game”.  While she got finshed I hid it in the pile of cards. Taking every little bit of the card in a certain place. I picked it up and guess what? I won the game 😍✋
No bc same, me and my friend have a high vocabulary for our age and use a lot of words others don’t understand and that are “advanced” so we are considered “smart kids” and it’s kind of dumb because yes we have a high vocabulary and that’s an okay reason ig but we just get out work done on time so we get good grades like what? It isn’t hard so why be called “smart”?
Actually im dumb but considered the smartest kid in class i think becuz i cheat better than everyone and feel bad when they actually want me to help him but i say no
I also have a story, we were in a final English exam (I'm from Colombia) and I had no idea, we did it in the computer room, I was considered one of the smart ones, so what I do is take my cell phone out of a inside pocket of my uniform jacket and start translating everything to understand better, then the one next to me notices it and makes him laugh, what I didn't know is that he was laughing because we were sitting right in front of a window and he was just passing the head of English, I had never felt a fear as great as that, I do not notice it but because of the nerves that I would have noticed it, I almost screwed up the exam because when I went to the listening part I gave him to finish the exam without having put nothing in that part, so I had to run and look for the boss to help me, one of the exams that I will not forget
Hehe the buddy meme
nah cheating nowadays are easy since probably most of us work on laptops so we can cheat and it’s not that hard
Once I saw the smartest kid in my class cheating on a maths kahoot by using a website that told the answer and I was like 'what on earth'
I’ve heard teachers legally can’t tell all the students someone’s else’s grade
I was the powerful kid in elementary. Everybody knew my name and I was just the nurses daughter! There was a kid that was the son of the high school principal!!! And still! Still people were afraid and scared of me and did not want to mess with me. (I'm not scary. Neither dangerous. I just wouldn't take crap from anyone)
Same
Is me or did I do tye same thing
Well i was smart for no reason i first place for some reason even tho im dumb
"Don't keep it to yourself"  Me: ✍✍✍
I'm considered the smartest in class.... But my braincells left me. They broke up with me. In the most important part of my grade.
its not a joke its a 🔥hazard 🔥
I mean...atleast he knew the answers? He just couldn't remember them 😭😭
My teacher said im smart but im just lazy
I used to cheat on my Japanese tests. Couldn't remember that one kanji? wrote it on the desk that was so dark I didn't need to cover it for the teacher not to notice. I also helped quite a few kids cheat in other classes cause I was one of the smarter kids, sometimes they asked and I would let them peak at my answers, other times I just felt like it and gave answers to people that were visibly struggling , and this one time I helped all the ap world history classes cheat on the weekly test by finding a quizlet account with all the answers for every test (as we later found out) for some friends who then spread it to everyone else.
I’m letting myself go too
In high school one of my religion teachers who is really chill was talking about how the school system relies a lot on our integrity to make sure we do the work and learn. He asks about copying off your friends homework and MORE THAN HALF of the class is like "oh yeah I couldn't survive without that" Little me who had almost NEVER copied, was mind blown.
In 3rd grade in elementary school and got the award for getting my work done in a snap and uhhh I was just racing my friend and me and my friend were the only people who knew and it was so funny
when i was in highschool my grades droped and most of my stuff was on a computer. for stuff i had to on paper i asked to go to my tracking teachers room. i had an app on my phone i used to cheat on everything
The smartest kid in my class in 5th grade his name is Justin and he finished everything so quickly and is “so smart” and one time I looked at his computer screen and he was using a calculator and when you were in elementary school and you used a calculator it was a big deal so I immediately told my bestie and she was shocked 😂
It's not a mistake ✨ it's a masterpiece 8
Bro this was me. I am one of the smartest kids in my class, and I cheated on a test by looking at someone else computer screen. (The person I cheated off of was in front of me) and I got a good grade because of it. Bro still can't believe I got a good grade in there. And that's one of the reasons why I have an a in that class
Yeah they say that I am one of the “smarter kids in the class” and then I just gave up and cheated and I got a 100% and ONLY me and everyone were like “How Do you do that” me in my chair😐
I love your videos and I like horchata to
To be honest most of the "dum" kids either truly don't understand the material or just don't care
Yes
I let my friend cheat of me since I'm second smartest in the class and he isn't the smartest and we got 💯 percent
So don't keep it to yourself
That whole class are for the streets, not one person snitched? Wiiild
It’s ok not to be ok *titan cry*
Its not a mistake its a masterpiece
it's not a mistake 🌠it's a masterpiece 🌠
I am the smartest kid In class and I have cheated on like 2-3 tests and I didn’t do anything with paper but I looked on others paper so that I know the answer
I did actually, SHE USED TWO COMPUTERS AND SAT AT THE BACK OF CLASS. And if me and my friend’s cheated WE WOULD RE DO THE TEST NOTHING HAPPENED TO HER
You look like my buddy chase
I still have a question how do you not know jack!?
*Not me cheating on my history yearly (as the smart kid) and getting full marks*
we were on test and then the teacher goes to number 2🤮 but the teacher said dont write your anwsers yet or  your going to the principles office and i was like -ok- and then litterly the smartest student anwserd all the test and the teachers pet snicthed and then principles office🤣🤣
Smart kids sometimes cheat cuz they're pressured and everyone have high expectations on them
Basically the same story happened to me, seventh grade, grades go down, but I am still one of the smartest in the matter of grades which was confusing since I would be getting A lot of C's
I did try to cheat once and I got caught before the test but still got full marks🤣🤣🤣
When I was in with grade, I sat behind the popular girl in math, she was one of the smartest in the class. This girl, she wasn't one to be messed with. Anyway, we were taking a test and I watch her pull at her phone and use Photomath on a question. Obviously, I didn't tell anyone until like weeks later because I didn't want to get on her bad side because she scares me.
It’s not a mistake✨ITS A MASTERPIECE✨
I have this weird mindset that cheating would be too much work (internet was bad that time so I couldn’t be bothered), I’d rather memorize things since I had a good memory (keyword here: had)
I'm one of dose😅😅
My way in cheating in the exam is i put it in my pencil case
What if you were cheating off each other and we both knew
Yo same (nobody found out tho)
Bro some kid caught my cheating paper and he ask if that were the answer for the math test that was next day but im smart and said that it was a old paper from the history test so i save that one because i think fast and btw we only had multiple questions because we all did awful on writing questions xd
I thought I were going to talk about someone named like brad
Fax I fell you
Same
I was in first or second grade and I was stuck sitting next to this kid who my parents would try and set me up with cuz they knew his mom and he was a sporty type,beefy,not too smart and your birthdays were three days apart.plus my initials were a.g and his were b.k so we had to sit next to each other sorry about the length. But I knew alot he didn't. So he'd always copy me. Spelling tests I didn't know all the answers so I just did what he did and he had the answers inside his desk and he'd look down and quickly put them down. So I did the same thing but he got caught and I didn't. Even when he said I was doing it to, because of his reputation vs mine she didn't believe him and he got a zero and went to the office. I wonder if he remembers
Yes
I cheated on my science test yesterday, I didn't need it but I got one wrong
I remember I always considered this one girl ima cal her Alice she would always be the first done with work but then one day we found out why so the teacher was just telling us what to do right? And out of nowhere she says “What are you doing” and it turns out Alice was doing all the work while the teacher was talking and she had to do it all over again
Sameee
This reminds me of me not the cheating part but being smart in elementary and middle school but not high school lol
At my school would’ve respected him for it
I just made myself a cheat sheet cuz I’m bad at multiplying and dividing fractions
Kids in my art class cheated on the test and the pretty much failed and I didn’t cheat and I jot a perfect grade lol
It's not a mistake ✨ it's a master piece ✨
Technically if you “cheat” on a test my writing it down, it doesn’t count since you already figured out the answers
I was the best kid in Class before and now I just gave up and why the heck is math so hard
Its not a mistake ✨ ITS A MASTERPIECE ✨
Damn you started falling off in 7th grade too?
I'm considered one of the smartest kids in my classes  In 4th grade, there was this subject that was just impossible, I think it was Home Economics, so a HUGE majority of my class ended up with lines of 70 and 80  One of them was me  My mother was extremely strict with making sure I passed with High Honors, so I ended up changing like 7 of my quiz scores  I didn't deserve to be one of the highest students at the end of that year  Also for clarification, 87 is a failing grade, if you get something below that you aren't considered an Honor anymore at the end of the year, doesn't matter if the rest of your grades were perfect
Help💀😭✋
I was rly good at school in the early years but after grd 4 i just gave up, i cheated on tests and worksheets and i got good grades but i've never told anyone
This one time in school my friend copied someone in a test and when they gave back the test....He still Failed
Shout out to the super friendly low to medium grade kids. Y’all are the real mvps of the class
its okeh not to be okeh (titan cry 😭)
I lie a lot no cap 🧢 lol I am a cheater
I haven’t but… I used to have friends that would always ask me for answers and I would always give it to someone and be like “idk if it’s right so if you get it wrong now you know” just because I didn’t want to get called out, even tho I knew it was right 😳😳
Same bro I'm Guatemalan so getting good grades is death. So I do my work. The kids in my class ask me to help them on math but I have been cheating and finding short cuts   for 4 years now. I gave up
I don’t
I remember not cheating. Now im in Ninth grade
its not a mistake ✨its a masterpiece ✨
God loves you and I do too and he sent his son  Jesus to die on the cross for our sin.Give your life to Jesus before it’s to late. Jesus he is the way,the truth and the life.If you want to know how reply with how!
When you cheat on a test and _still_ get all the answers wrong 😔🤚
A smart kid in class cheat by a white board and the teacher can't even see it 😕
Chicken 🍗
Same but in 5th grade
Ayo 😳
Same I am getting tired of being smart
In 4th grade we had weekly spelling tests, and our teacher would give a prize for the best score. We had 10 different words that would definitely be there, and 5 different "advanced" words. 2 of the 5 were on the test every week. I was very good at spelling but would usually miss 1 or both of the advanced ones. I was second place every time, and the same girl always got a perfect score. One week we moved desk assignments, and I was next to her. I saw her sneaking looks at her word sheet in her desk for EVERY word. I was angry and told the teacher. The teacher didn't even look into it, she just got mad at me and made me write an apology to the girl and stand up in front of the class to read it. That's one of the times in my early life that I learned two important lessons.. "Life isn't fair" and "Snitches get stitches"...
Imagine your teacher is saying this
Yep lol
Dude, it’s always 7th, same happened to me, I was great every year, then 7th grade came up and I just gave up, idk 7th grade sucks
Me
Em
Too easy
Respect for your class for not snitching
✨ It's not a mistake its a masterpiece ✨

Me and my friend were all in it! Like if someone struggled we helped in what we could and this time was my turn to help, I had for a couple of years French lessons so I was more advanced than my classmates since it was a new semester and they had to go back some lessons since they were a ton of new kids than before so the class was in a A2 level and mine was B2 so for me it was easy going even I held some clases in my house to help AND MY BESTIES NEEDED ME! but they still didn’t got to studio everything because of other exam applied that same day, so I made a plan (based on a movie) I would be the first to summit the exam and since ny teacher was easy going she sometimes would help out during the exam (not much just for you to know some words and what verbs to use) so in that time I wrote a paper with the most answers I could (obviously the writing parts where a no so I just gave my exam example) I fold it, put it with an eraser, made a signal and said loudly “hey can I borrow your eraser?” And like that she quickly wrote everything her exam and then when the teacher wasn’t looking I past it to my other friend and repeat the same thing with my other friends, fortunately the exam wasn’t long it was 12 questions the problem was to be fast enough for everyone to copy, the good thing it was that everyone just needed help in some questions not he whole exam which made it all more faster for everyone, and bitch till this day we where proud we pulled that out.
"it's not a mistake","🌠ITS A MASTERPIECE🌠"
It's okeh to not be ok titan  cry
*I once cheated on a vocab and my teach pulled up my paper and said out loud how bad of am example I was and I shouldn't be here*
Everyone cheats tests, those who said they don't cheat on tests are lying.
This is also me i used to be the first in my class on the report cards but now in 7th grade i am like the 7th
Its not a mistake ✨ IT'S A MASTERPIECE ✨
I feel ya when you started to give up and not knowing jack. Who's jack
It's not a mistake ✨ITS A MASTERPIECE✨
Same but I lasted to geometry
I mean you cheated for a reason right? 😂
Btw you can still get failed for that test for cheating 20 years later fun facts
Imagine ur teacher saw this video and went to ur house
man knows what happens through his entire school life and i can’t even remember what anyone said yesterday
“It’s not a mistake”, ✨ITS A MASTERPIECE✨
Once my teacher accidentally got ranking numbers on people's final tests for English and Math, she put whiteout over them but it was super easy to see through
Lol sameeee
It’s not a mistake it’s a ✨MASTERPIECE✨
Yeah..no goodbye YouTube
I have never cheated yet tho I remember I got 80 % also the highest in my class no cheating and every one got 20% - 40 % LOl 😂
I did this 2 times as the smart kid because I didn’t study
I'm the smartest in our class but I didn't cheat once
Ayo😳
Ayo😳
In my school they don’t tell you what the test is about until the next day the day before they just whack two books on your table 😭😭😂😂
I was one of the smart kids in class, not the smartest, but above class avarage. Once we had a pop quiz in Swedish and our seats were organized in sets of 4 facing each other and because it was just a pop quiz and not an actual exam we got to keep the tables that way, I didn't know how to spell a word in the translation section of the pop quiz, I happened to be sitting face to face with a kid who was smarter than me, so I read upside down and copied her answer. We were 11.
☔😍😍🎀🎀☘🤩🙄🍆🍺🧃🟡🤥🌸🧐🐂♑🐎😵😵😒😖🥰🥰
I'm the smartest kid in my class, and I cheated on a test A lot.
British secondary schools are so opposite we’d all exchange methods of cheating during revision write formulas on each other’s shoes and form a code for multiple choice . We we’re all suddenly friends as soon as a tricky test came up because at least one kid always knew the answer
He Can Remember Anything he Did Me here I can't I remember what I did 1hr Before :*()
I'm concidered one of the smartest and we wrote a test about a book we were supposed to read and I finished it a couple of weeks ago and couldn't remember a lot of the details so I copied from my friend. I would have absolutely aced the test if we had written it earlier.
In my class, everyone's cheating. And everyone know.s
Ye cuz the smartest was actually my friend, everytime when I was stuck she would show her answers so I wouldn't have to fail or something 😃
bro I deadass can't cheat. I have the thought of someone staring at me like 🙂 and blackmail me and shit 😂 hell naw
"its not  a mistake"  ✨its a MASTERPIECE✨
The smartest kid in my entire school got straight As from grade 5th till 9th , only then was he caught . Turns out the smart ass learned how to read brail and had a piece of paper in his pocket every exam
That now slowly giving up
It's not ok okeh to be okeh (titan cry 😭)
The same thin happened to me I drew a dingaling on my friends paper and told him to show one peron and whether whole class knew and someone told on me and now i'm in trouble
Don’t be embarrassed till now I still cheat on my tests like we have this blinders and I will get up to pretend sharpen my pencil to walk past the person beside to see there answers and Iqbal oils sharpen it and try and keep remembering the answers that they had and I will put them on my paper and I would always get my test right
Pin this comment
How is that cheating if you write the answers you already knew
Ayo😳
You aren’t cheating unless you get caught
I have
Tbh anyone who hasn’t cheated are lying or a godsend. Just do it quietly
Ight if I cheat don’t keep it to myself gotcha
Me and my friend are the smartest and i saw him cheat
Telling your classmates that type of stuff is the worst decision I ever made. So in elementary school i sneaked my phone into class and told just ONE person and as soon as the teacher walked in, he snitched on me and yeah I got in trouble
is anyone else also not giving a fuck? is it just me?
Weird I'm in 7th grade
I feel like it's the pressure to stay on top of the class. I know it from personal experience 😅
He’s name was vince
Smartest kids in my whole class she cheated on math test I saw her because I was on the back seat
I was in my class known as one of the smartest kids but one time I was super lost in a test I just didn't know the answer so I pulled out the my notebook and wrote the answer and the dude sitting next to me was like ಠ_ಠ(;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`)
But...you had to do the work to get the answers. You just jotted down the answers you got. Theoretically, you didn't cheat. You just made a note to youself saying, "Hey, stupid, don't forget that these are the answers"
pin me when u get 1 mil
What if every smart kid was always just cheating and the just dumb
Don't lie. All the smartest (ok maybe im just exaggerating but you know the drill) had cheated too. Not once but lots too like-
Yeeeeeeeess
Hi god bless have a good day and a good night
This is just an explanation of me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I kind of have this, but with studying. I for some reason am able to memorize everything we learn when writing it down in our notebooks, so I had incredibly high grades. Which meant a lot of my classmates thought I was a dedicated and boring student that studied all day. Lasted for 5-6 years until CoVID started I got in contact with those classmates. They found out I was grinding osu mania pp and random horror games with my online homies all day.
I alway cheat in class
Best idea now ok how to cheat
The same hapened to me
It’s not good that’s bad no
Too easy 🎉
Same
In Spanish class when we have a test I cheat but this one time this girl that I liked needed help with the test so I helped her she was very and said thank you.
too easy
All the smart kids in my class are in a group that is all under oath to help each other cheat. We know we just want in.
Never give up
in school i’m considered the “good kid” and i’m just following the rules and having common sense and it’s not that hard
I did once my friend knew an answer to a huge question and it got me a ginormous candy cane
Ayo😳
Bro me in a nutshell
ayo 😳
I remember I would get mad at this whenever we were graded on a curve. You cheating and getting a high score screwed the rest of us who didn’t cheat out of extra points
Ayo 😳 Too easy
Too easy
I'm never cheating because, since I'm in kindergarten, my table is always at front .
Same
I'm in high school and in my Biology class everyone thinks I'm sooo smart, which I am...I wont say that I'm not, but Its not hard, that class is so easy and he gives us the answers while studying they just dont pay attention
i am that kid
lol
don't worry even if I know the answer I'm going to cheat just to make sure and I believe there is not a single test I haven't cheated in
You’re such a cheater and that’s not how you learn
349000th like
Too easy
Me
If you want to be the smartest kid in the class, just care about what the teacher is saying, so many people don't even open their book in the class and then just because I do anything that isn't talk with a friend I'm smart. It worked since I entered school lol
I recently had to do an essay on Buddhism which I had to do over break (I didn’t) so I pulled up my auto essay writer and I hope I get a decent grade
1:Nah I Never Saw The Smartest Kid In My Class Cheat,  2:BECAUSE NO ONE FROM MY CLASS IS SMART!
pretty positive this is why we are only allowed to use #2 pencils on state wide tests
When I was in elementary school one of my second smartest classmates cheated on the test and the teacher knew about it then he does to two times his work
Tbh you're classmates are stupid . They're "disgusted" and" ashamed" ? Bruh . It's not like you committed a  crime or something and it's normal to cheat in 7th grade for atleast once lol
https://youtube.com/shorts/vWl184K_mpw?feature=share
Ttttt
I'm considered the "Google" in my class. We had a week1 and week2 summative test in History, but I didn't study. So I looked at my modules while my dad was asleep and my brother and mother were away. I aced the test, LOL!
Meeee to
No
Bro, I'm the smartest kid on kid on class and I'm now dumb
this is funny to me,because this thing just happened to me in class but the rest of the class were also cheating and none of them cared about anyone else cheating and so we all just cheated on the test while our teacher wasn't there,even the smart kid was cheating and it was a musics class
Hahahahahhahahahahahhahahahh
Its not a mistake 💥 its a masterpiece
How do you cheat when you don't know the questions
Lol...l was like a straight A student and considered smart but yea...won't lie...l did cheat on many tests...l mean there was this really complicated formula from Maths and l just wrote it on my hand and wore a full sleeve t-shirt ...and guess what? Nobody noticed and l got straight A's as usual lol...it's okay to cheat in high school...l never used that formula after graduating and it didn't even help me a tiny bit lol
I don't cheat myself anymore , but I have to help my classmates for chemistry. Like B+ is amazing compared to D-'s they got sooooo I marked some answers for one of them.
Yes, true but I can't really say anything since they are my friends (I'm also a smart kid that's why) literally everyone in the class at least give answer to each other, cheat using cheat notes or books. Like I'm always pissed and also two of my friends would always get all grumpy, rude, and mad whenever I got number one. They would glare at me as if I'm their long lost enemy like bruh.
i have this girl in my class she is pretty smart its my friend but when she cheat on test and she gets A we are not like DISGUSTED quite oppisite we are like : AYOOOOOOOO LIDA YOU DID IT. its quite impressive because se menages to cheat in geography and this teacher is just insane its just an achievement
I usually get a decent grade, usually fail like(4A,2E) or the other way around (4A,2B) so i was always questioning why I’m always in the upper class while having 2 failing subjects?
Elf is the best movie
Yooooo this is actually me I was the "smart kid" in middle and elementary school but high school hits different. Specifically,  i cheated on a chem test along with most of the class. It was just a memorization  test anyway
For me it’s when there are 2 smart kids and 1 smart kid gives an answer and the other one says it’s wrong the whole class is ready for the debate 😐
You are lazy cuz you sit on the bed all the time
I'm also a smart kid in my class and i do also cheat
Bruh my friend c on the test and my my teacher take the book and the teacher was so mad
Gifted kid burnout--
I once had a partner in my class because it was always sit by someone and it was in fifth grade but the person was so smart that she give me all the answers because she did not want to see me fail because she does not want a dumb partner
A few weeks ago we had a test which everyone failed, even the smart kids(including myself)
Wow 👏  why would you do that 😕
Im the smartest kid in class in english so one time i didn't know something so i cheated from the kid beside me and no one noticed and I've cheated in an armenian test as well
Yes I have seen more than one
Why am i like you i was the smartest guy in elementary then now im grade 7 i didnt do no jack shit
Him: I don’t know I just do my work  Me: I do my work and I’m still failing 🤨
i never cheated on my tests, but just recently, i cheated for the first time ever- i wrote washable ink on my flip of my skirt and the teacher can’t check under my skirt, and he’s a guy, so he can’t do anything, i got the second highest, 🤫
I used to be the smartest kid in class until i moved to other school. Now i'm one of the dumbasses
It’s primary and secondary school 😂😂😂😂😂😂
If I told anybody else I was going to cheat then there’s be a super high chance that a teacher would find out- I’m pretty sure we can get suspended just for cheating on one question
Yes in grade 3
Once the smartest kid copied half of my English test and she would cheat alot so let's just say she was smart in that to
In the 4th grade the smartest kid in class used a phone
I mean I'm in 5th grade and don't cheat on test because if it's math or a reading subject It'll be almost a 100 percent guarantee that I pass so no
I can't tell you
The only thing that really came in useful for being one of the smartest kids in my 7th grade class was that my teachers never suspected that I was cheating
Yea that me on 1st grade i had this dumb girl in front of me bro i told no one so now i still dont know my grade so ummmmmmm... .......
I used to cheat a lot(kind of ....smart kid 😅😅) but my cheats were totally different, I used to tell people answers and then...let's just say I would do something horrible if they didn't wrote the answer...  Once there was a girl who ticked "clamydomonas" as an answer to an MCQ(as opposed to my answer)lil did we nicknamed her as clamydomonas and kept it for years to come 😅
SO ONE DAY I NEEDED HELP ON A TEST THEN I STARTED CRYING AND WHEN I CRIED THE TEACHER CAME TO ME AND SHE LITERALLY HELPED ME and it's been a month since I haven't done the test
I think I accidentally cheated once cuz I looked at someone’s paper on accident but I saw their answer and I wrote it down cuz I was stuck on the question 💀
I legit watched elf 2 hours ago lol
My "friends" cheat on test but end up failing the exam lmaoooo
The class:how can u do this  Me:UMM u guys also cheat u know
They call me the smart kids in class
In my chinese class that happened and the teacher just canceled the test
Ngl i would have done the same if i was a little bit dumber then i am now
When i was in like fourth grade i was put into this gifted program or something for smart people.  From that point on my knowledge has been increasingly decreasing
For me most of the smart people in my class were actually dumb because they would cheat on every test but one time they got a bad grade because a kid snitched ……………………..it’s not me OK
I am very widley seen as one of, if not, the smallest kid in the entire grade. In 4h grade though, we were memorizing the US states and their capitals by regions. However, when we were doing the southwest states, I didn't know wtf to do. So what did I do? I photocopied the study guide on my copy machine at home. When the teacher asked us to hand in our study guides, I did so, but hid the copied study guide under my desk. During the test, I would sneak a peek at the paper for some answers I didn't know. I finished and turned in my paper. Later, the teacher took me out in the hall and accused me of cheating. Knowing I wasn't getting out of it, I confessed. Turns out, the kid sitting behind me saw me and SNITCHED! I then had to retake the test at lunch for half credit. I got like a 35%. I still would've passed with a 70% if I hadn't had cheated. :(
My teacher always says... If you cheat you are not hurting me but hurting you. Or something like that.
I'm going to do it 😈😈
Did your mom watch this or did dhe know that that happened because if you were in 7th grade right now you would get a really harsh punishment
Ayo😳
No and when most of the class know there’s gotta be someone who is the teachers pet
How is that Cheting
One of the girls in my class wrote information (about the subject we were being tested on) on the inside of her mask....
he looks like ben of the week… they should be friends
Back in college, my class was separated into two sections with different exam schedules so each section would hand out the answers to the the other section of the subject that wad taken early on so   TEAMWORK
I am the smart kid but i aint no nerd im with the gang and i dont cheat *cough* *cough* I couldnt but i wouldnt anyway
Bruh the smartest kids in my class cheat in every test
Sheesh
Im in 6th grade and done this before once only and i am the smartest in the year group🙄🙄🙄🙄😜
same story as me but I don't cheat that way I cheat the traditional way I sometimes look at someone paper when I need help
lol i was like the smartest kid and then i started dropping 💀
I already did it at 4th grade in javanese exam with a friend. I succeeded
I'm writing this down in my cheating list
In my class everybody knows how others cheat and don't care cuz we all cheat.  Like we even know which teachers help us cheating 🕴
I was basically the "smartest" kid, and my friends would literally cheat with me 😬✌🏼..
I am the smartest kid in class. Now in 9th grade, still didn't need to cheat. Just casually getting the best grades. Don't worry my day will come. Just not today.
I am the smartest kid form the school
I was known as the good girl in school, but in high school, I went to one of those private schools, 1 time in my religion class, I sat right in front of the teacher and we were taking the test, I was cheating the whole time,  But never got caught, after the test I was so dumbfounded
Grade 7 was when i started getting low grades so i get u
When I was in 3rd 4th and 5th I was the one of the “smart kids” but once I got to 6th grade I was doing good and keeping my Journal net and clean but I couple weeks in I gave up I just shoved papers in there and did not care (ever time I walked in to the classroom the ballon that was Disguised as my brain popped) I hated math in 6th grade
I saw my friend cheat on a test using a CALCULATOR
I was the smart kid back then, and i cheated a lot, just no one knew (exept from my bff)
I WAS considered one of the smarter kid in the class in middle school and I NEVER cheat in my exams. But now I entered highschool I become dumber and dumber😌until one day we have online exam and I really can't answer it so.. I cheated. I look for the answers in the textbook but it's just not there🙂and some of the questions is "opinion" questions so I have to make conclusion based on my answer😌then.. I waited for the result and guess what? I failed AND that is the FIRST time I ever fail an exam😭now finally I can relate to "ever cheated on exam and still fail" meme😀I move into another school before knowing another of my exam paper result. I mean.. I  don't even want to know😌  Sorry for bad english
Who's jack?

Story time:  in my elementary school, I was one of the four smartest kids in the class, along with my best friend Naomi and two other boys. When it came around to final tests for 5th grade, everyone was stressing out and nervous but us 4 were chilling having fun. When the time came for the tests, I had only one goal for the tests: I needed to beat one of the two boys (out of us 4 smart kids) (I’ll call him James) and he would pay me $20. This bet was around the whole class  and all the boys were rooting for him to win and all the girls were rooting for me to win. We had two tests: a maths test and a  literacy/ English test. Everyone knew that Math was James’ strong suit (since he has a tutor and his dream job is to be a mathematician) and English was mine. we did both tests  and when I was done, I looked around to see that I was the first one done. James look pretty worried and he seemed like he didn’t know the answers which was good for me. Two days later the results came back in. James had his $20 on the table and I had mine. Our teacher at first banned us from betting money but since we were going to leave soon she just allowed it (best teacher ever) and she suggested that both of us stand next to her on each side and she raises the hand who got the highest marks on both tests (like in boxing). Everyone was waiting patiently as my teacher said: “And the person with the highest marks is….” 🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁   AND THE CROWD WENT WILD AS MY HAND WAS RAISED!! The girls started partying and the boys clearly weren’t so sad as they were happy too. James looked pretty sad so I was thinking if i should give him a hug or a high five but I decided to give him a hug (pretty awkward and people started shipping us even though they know we’re just friends) and since that day he became my best friend and now he goes to school with the friend I was talking about before (Naomi) I hope they’re having fun together ✨    If you made it this far then you deserve this: 👑🫂
Same bro when i was in 7 grade i was one of the smartest and i wrote down the questions then went home and googled the answers then wrote it in my notes. Eitber way the test wasnworth half of my grade lol
Dude in ALL of my classes everyone helps everyone cheat so we can all get good grades I have a small class and everyone has known each other for at least a year so we are all close
My friends always tell me when they cheat so we could snitch like 10 guys with my friend now
I know your situation I also kind of had the same situation 😸😅
I got the highest grade in math class even tho I guess on abt half of it 💀 either smth wrong with me or my class
Once i saw some one sitting beside me cheating on a test. But I was the shy kid so I wouldn't tell the teacher so I let her cheat
Yea when snart kid cheat that happen but when i cheat lol never
Why us my friend like this she is not my friend anymore
Same
one time during finals, my best friend who is one of the smart kids, cheated on a test and as soon as she told me after I knew I was so f*cked
That why i only give answer to my bestfriend
I am one of the highest rankers but I smart play it. When you cheat also tell some answers to most of your friends so they'll at least stop complaining
I used to be super good at math when I was younger, but now I kinda stink at it so all the kids are surprised I can't do math anymore 😂
So she told me she wouldn't cheat on this test and I said okay let's pinky promise but she broke the promise I'mma tell her mom call Mom doesn't like it when my friend cheats on her test
So when I was in school this day and we were doing a test and I saw my friend cheating she said she was the smartest kid in the class liar because she told me she was never going to cheat on her test but she lied to me we pinky promised but she broke the promise I'm so disappointed😡😡😡 tell her mom
I find the statement "I just did my work" to be so accurate
I remember bringing a sheet of drawing and really wanted to tell my friend about it, then i give it to her and a person behind me yelling 'HEY YOU'RE CHEATING ARENT YOU?!!!' and then i goes into confusion mode and explained that it's just a drawing 🤣🤣
Im the smartest kid in my class and i never cheat
Is it cheating if you exchange answers with 3 other people and whichever answer is most agreed upon gets written down by everyone?
Is it just me or is everyone that is smart named jack?
It’s quite easy to cheat on tests now, in my school we do tests online so unless the teacher is next to you, you could Google the answers if you want to, I’m always tempted but don’t. The thing that happens to me the most is I know the answer but think it’s unrelated and just type n to get to the next one, I then want to scream.
😉😉😉😊😊😊😊 I like your videos
YUH
My decend into idiocracy was when online school started, I used to be the smartest I turned I into one of the dumbest
When I was in 3rd grade we took spelling test every week and they stressed me out so bad, on Sunday nights I would sit there worrying about it. And if you pass on the first day you got to play games on the computer while everyone else had to take the test for the week. Every week I pass on the first try, except one week where I had no Confidence I was going to pass, so I Cheated. I didn’t get caught but when I got home my mom ask me how it went and I told her I passed. She then gets out the spelling list and asks me to spell some of the words, Me not actually knowing how to spell the words spelled incorrectly. She then asked how I pass the test if I didn’t know how to spell the words Which ended up with me eventually being caught. The next day my parents brought me to the school and in the morning met with my teachers and I apologize to her for cheating in front of the Cafeteria. I still remember my teacher was Wearing a yellow shirt with black flowers on it(this was like 8 years ago) Moral of the story is don’t cheating and if you do cheat don’t get caught slacking.
I’m half asleep watching this and I heard him say don’t keep it to yourself
I tried to cheat ones and i got caught and i still got the thing wrong but i passed and i was the *smartest* kid in class it was embarrassing
I was the 3rd smartest in the class.So my sit is behind them,one day in a test I saw they were cheating. I told them if they help me I will not tell the teacher.
I was you, I was the 2nd smartest in our class in 4th grade but I started to cheat I was a master once but not anymore
So how did you write down all the answers and it gets a high score of the test if you didn’t know the answers
I am considered a 'smart' kid, my whole math class was all like,  "yay ur here!!" I was like, hi
Don’t keep it to my slept mk
Is it just me or is the you sit throne of lies got me Dying of  laughter
I've never cheated on a test I'm too big brain
a short a day keeps the boredom away
i dont mean to brag but i was the top student in my class and i still am, ive cheated on multiple tests and helped others cheat in exams although i never have myself in serious examinations i have helped others whenever i could without jeopardising myself
I gave up on school at this point. I just wanna go home and draw all day.
Him saying don’t don’t keep it to your self me: ok
These shorts are entertaining😍😸!
im concidered pretty smart but I've cheeted on almost every test I've taken sence 6th grade when i got a smart watch
Be sure to believe, have faith and trust God and and repent of your sins so that when he comes back if you have been doing these you have been saved already.  and all sins are forgivable (except blasphemy against the Holy Spirit) because of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross.    and don't worship the antichrist when he comes he will force the world to worship and give them the mark of the Beast which doesn't let you go to Heaven.  And I'm not forcing you by the way God did give us free will 😎👍                                                     But it is better to know God before he comes back with wrath  And Jesus was nailed onto a cross because of our sins and he lived a perfect and sinless life and he isnt mad that we were the reason he died on the cross, after he died he was brought back to life and he wants us to put our faith in him and to trust his sacrifice so when we die we can enter Heaven.  And we can Know while we are still here. Don't let Jesus be a stranger to you. Don't let him   say "Depart from me for I do not know you"  But let him say   "Welcome home my good and faithful servant"  Have a Great day!  Sorry if I annoyed you   Summed up  don't worship antichrist (the one who gives a marking if you do (the mark being 666) if you do, you will go to hell later. And have faith in Jesus Christ to go to heaven  God has answered some of my prayers and I've felt the Holy Spirit and hes sent me signs and there are Bible prophecies that have come true).  . And sorry if I annoyed you.  And don't listen to music with sin in the lyrics (sex, drugs, murder and other sins) it's a sin but it's forgivable but just because a sin is forgivable doesn't mean you should commit it that's abusing Gods grace/forgiveness or it could be.  And the same applies for cussing, using Gods name in vain, lying, sex before Marriage and sex with multiple people And the same applies for masterbation and watching/looking at porn/hentai and cheating (on litterly ANYTHING)
I never actually needed that type of cheating but asking help from friends 90% of the exam time? Hell yeah! Everyone knows asking for help from the front seat is kinda hard but I had to always sit in the very first seat because i was considered as "the smartest student", but bro i was a master at cheating. And there was this girl who used to sit behind me because she was considered as "the 2nd smartest student" NEVER told anyone a thing in the exam hall, nor did she ask for help (no one would help her anyway). And there's me who helped EVERYONE in the class, everyone helped me too. The girl behind me thought she was smart because she didn't help anyone in case they'll get better grades than her, well that was the dumb reason she'd get lower grades than me.
Damn my class used to share chits by throwing at each other  ✨ silently ✨ and he had no clue😂😂 he wasn't sleeping. He was walking around the room. And when he was infront of us, we would literally throw at each other. That's how much of ✨innocents✨ we were😂😂
No lie just last year I was doing a group quiz and I'm the geek and all my partners were all just cheatin and I got blamed
I've cheated on 3 test and got away with it and I was copying the smart kid
I feel like everyone has cheated at least once.
Too easy
What was the hardest subject for everyone and when did it become hard since I think I screwed up for grade 7
I am giving up now, slowly I'll be dead
I'm one of the quietest person in the class and I did mine homework good some of mine friends say I'm smart ;-; I feel like it's just cause im quiet-
I'm in the 8th grade, and I had a Spanish test on a Monday. I never got to study for it cause spanish is not for me. I didn't know anything and my chromebook was next to me. So I took my chromebook slowly and whipped it under my desk. I opened it and sat in the most awkward position like I was disabled or smth. My teacher sometimes looked at me but I did my best to act normal, one of my classmates sitting in front of me saw me, but she was cool and didn't tell anybody. I got a decent grade which was in the 90's.
You see, we have online school...
I am one of the smart kids and I have honestly never cheated. After my english exam, the day after the teacher distributed the exam paper all corrected and I got the highest marks and then my teacher said that I got the highest marks. She literally announced it to the whole class. I felt so shy and crawled under my desk cause I kinda have social anxiety. This was the worst experience. Not that I got the highest marks but the announcement.
Too easy
Hahah, me being the smartest kid in class, but doing same thing
Me who creats a grop to cheat and makes a full proof plan nice
So I won't judge
Wow I you
Dude same I just never studied and still came first and second until grade 4 up to this day I still haven't studied
Like, i was also considered one of the smart kids in class. This year it was getting hard like i couldnt focus. So i decided to look at my notes DURING the test. Good thing i never told anyone about this unless they see my comment. I still got like 1-5 mistakes on that test sooo yeah
These shorts are so entertaining they always make my day better💕
So, I had this one time that I totally forgot how to do a curtain formula. I looked at the teacher that was watching us and saw that he had fallen asleep. So I thought by myself, why not? So that's when me and my friend worked together for 10 minutes straight and the best part is that we both got a really good grade. Lmao...
Im the smart kid and yes i one time cheated
Rose's are red violets are blue there's kids in my basement you'll be there soon
The toppers in my class cheat. Like, most in the top 5. I would always come in at the top till 7th then second in 8th and then I didn't even get the result in 9th and in 10th...... Wait, I am in it.  So, I am one of the smarter kids. Now, I am going down. Quarantine made me go down. A. LOT. But, I remember, once I cheated. Like I made a whole ass note and put everything kinda in it. But it was hard to find question answers in it. I cheated some questions but my cheat note was like a small notebook and wrote the question/answers in it and I hid it behind my blazer as it was winter. I cheated. No one knew. Not even my friends. NO. ONE. I got good marks. I probs would have still got it if i didn't waste my time making cheat notes. But yeah. But even after getting good marks I was actually not satisfied with it. Because *I knew* that I cheated. And it was a big one. I had all the question/answers. So, if it came from the notebook, I had the answer. So I was not satisfied. So from then on I stopped cheating THAT MUCH.  But I still write those formulas of maths and physics on my hand. It is less. Less enough that my hand is enough. One hand. In language ones it would be the names of the people who wrote the chapter. And like the part of periodic table that was coming. Or maybe something that I forgot to remember OR JUST couldn't remember. Or other reasons. But small things. And now I am more satisfied. That little cheat sheet takes a lot of pressure off me. Because its something, I REALLY needed. So, I am now satisfied too, and I have a little less pressure.  But really, NO ONE knows I cheated, OR that I still cheat a LITTLE.  Well, bye!!  Have a happy, long, healthy, life!! 💝🤗
Yes
I have cheated on many tests before
I've never cheated on a test
One of my secrets this year is that , on our last exam , one of the smartest kids asked me a question. You we usually come first in the class together and all and are like the  'smart kids' . I haven't told a soul , neither will. He's a good guy and works really hard. I know where he's coming from and I also know how much pressure we are put under.
I hated when people considered me a smart kid just because I was quiet and did my work unlike some people
I'm disgusted
I cheated on the Frist day of this year in 5th grade and the other classes found out we went home and lied
My rule in school life: 1.DONT CHEAT 2.ignore first rule just DONT GET CAUGHT
Yap
I'm ranked at the top of my grade and it's genuine but I'm probably one of the best cheaters out there, I condition my teachers to expect me to do things that could've been suspicious during a test like looking around a room or moving my laptop and pressing keys on them if the test is multiple choice. I calculate how good of a score would look natural and score slightly above, I take photos of my notes so that I can see them on my drive even on finals. if you do try these tricks just know you have to have a good reputation and be likeable, also don't abuse them, only use them in necessary classes or else you may get recommended to classes you are doomed to fail
You from Guatemala
My 4 grade teacher taught us how to make one she was my Favorite i used it just one time in music but it was worth it
Literally me
I am that person
Because mostly every test is in Schoology in my school, in my Math tests sometimes I search up answers or use the calculator split screen on the IPad. Worth it, lol
I’m one of the smartest kids in my class actually
I did
Is it just me or did my class mates always ask me how to spelled things///
I'm the one I was smarted kid And then I don't remember but I started and I remembered
look at me trying to cheat on a test but i literally have to do it normally
Se
UMMMM how do you know the answers to the test? Does the teacher give it to you a couple days before the test???
im one of the smart kids in my class, but i usually cheat on some of my work. i put a sheet of blank paper into my pocket (its usually math), take a pencil and ask to use the restroom. then, i take my phone out and calculate the answers. its only because i dont get it or im tired.
8m in fifth grade and I've been tye smartest in my class and on tests , if I try to cheat no one finds out +
Sorry but.. STOP JESUS IS COMING SOON REPENT FROM YOUR SINS AND TURN TO HIM BEFORE ITS TOO LATE AMEN
The lesson of today is don’t get caught cheating kids
Heres a fun secret: All smart kids are just experts at cheating and using google
I am also one of those smartest kids in class then 😂 and when I was in 2nd grade, me and my ✨partners as being one of the smartest kids in class✨ were literally fr sharing our answers on test. When someone know an answer and one didn't, we'll ✨share our answer✨. And another one this is still on 2nd grade, I have my reminder notebook where we put all reminders, and there's an answer and I cheated which I felt guilty about it 😬😂 But yeah I have so much fun in my chilhood 🙂.
I never seen my friend (the smartest kid in my class) cheat instead me and my other friend cheat by asking him the answer when the teacher was in the office
Same
I just leave the classroom, but I write all the equations on my leg.I know I just go searching on my phone
In my senior year music class the top student found the song we were studying she ruined it for all of us.
I'm the smartest kid in class until I'm at middle school I started to feel like being the smartest kid in class is considering as a nerd and might have a big chance of being bully so I started to get myself to top 10 in class and whenever I see someone cheated on test I just leave them alone so I can ask them the answer that I don't know and it's more fun that way
So in Science class I'm seen as "smart" but that's only cuz I know how to use formulas and everyone asks me to help them. One test I didn't understand the unit and when I opened it I said "Huh?" Loud. I heard people turning to look at me like they are about to die-
If he got the highest grade how could he be the cheater
Ummmm I do that I HATE studying
I hate when teachers say who got the highest grade
I’m an average kid in terms of my classes in middle school, but my competition is insane. You have to test to get into Gretchen Whitney High school. The 2nd best high school in California. Not to brag, but the point is if you cheat, you get kicked out. And if I get kicked out, I die
You can cheat but you cant get caught doing it
I am the Smart kid in 6th grade and my friend group will ask me for the answers Then when they get something wrong I correct my paper so I get a good grade
I'm consider as a smarter kids in class too, I never cheated as you said😂 and on 2nd grade I just got to be top 1 of the year, and I was really surprised. Lol
Too easy
We have the same blanket
Ya i never have cheated on a test but on one test i need a little help on it and i still feel bad about it 😬😬
TO ESAY
Noooo
I cheated on 3rd and the teacher caught me and called my dad....
I mean, do your work while you can, but if your find yourself having to deal with a subject that you will not use once your whole life and if you fail that subject, you lose a goddamn year of your life, go ahead and cheat
SAMEE
It's awful to be the smart kid cause everybody expects the best grades and behaviour bc if the other kids do stupid things it's bc that's how they are but if I did stupid or just normal kids stuff everybody would call me a dissapointment and it happened... a lot
I was never known as the smartest kid, but i was kinda good at 5th grade( i gave up after that, now im in 9th grade trying to get my grades up lol) but i was NOT good with religious studies, the teacher was talking really slowly and it was boring. So during the exam, i realized that i had my notebook under my desk and i slowly took it, opened it, and while i was looking at it, this annoying girl just had to tell the teacher. Fortunately tho, another student asked about something in their paper and the teacher had to stop to look into it, getting me the time i needed. I closed the notebook and lied to my teacher saying that it was only under my desk and i wasnt using it. He believed me.  I ended up getting something higher that 95 so yeah. Also, this is random but if anyone who knows me from school reads this theyll immediately know my identity lol
in 6th grade there was this guy that was really smart, but we caught him cheating on a pretest. someone asked really loudly what he was doing and he started freaking out, telling the teacher he deserved in-school-suspension. the teacher was laughing the entire time, and the boy didn’t get in trouble, it was a stupid pretest anyways XD
My classmates say that I’m the smartest of the class (I have great grades that I’ve been keeping for years) and when I was on 6th grade, I cheated on a physics test and got caught. I ended up with a very good grade actually but my mom… she was so angry. Well, the point is that my classmates were so surprised since I was considered the “good girl” and now a few years later, I see that they changed their perception of me for a more human one . But I still regret cheating 😂
I used to cheat on those spelling test things in elementary
I recognize that classroom background from somewhere... But I don't know where...
Oooh my god this same happened with me and funny part,,,,,, I was also in seventh grade.
Who’s jack
Same
Tbh i cheated just because i could.. I know.. And it wasn't just a short text on a paper OOooo NOooO no no! My friend i wrote a whole test on my desk (btw i studied law in high school so u can imagine 10 lessons on my desk) and no teacher knew. And i got to a point when if i had a test first thing in the morning, i would be in my desk an hour earlyer just to write shit on it... Totaly worth it
I mean at least he was being honest
Fr there are no snitches in my class, cause we all cheating
When you put a screen shot of elf i Laughed
One of my friends cheated and I was the smartest. I wanted revenge so the next time he was cheating, told the teacher immediately. Perfect reaction with sweat dripping from his face😌👌
One time in 7th grade we just wrote the answers on the chalk board and just disguised it as the topics to review. Our teacher had no idea and the whole class just copied the whole test lmao
I have a story so in 2nd class we started multiplication and we started with 12s i didn't know all of them and we had boxes and a tables book to learn our tables so when it came to the day of the test I put my tables book in my box
I used to be the go-to kid for answers. I was smart and a total nerd, and I wanted people to like me so I gave answers. That was elementary school. Now, in highschool, I cheated on a math test and got worse than if I would’ve actually worked the problems. I just didn’t feel like doing it. Honestly everyone in my third block cheats tho, besides me. I honestly don’t even remember actually taking a test in there, I just sat and goofed around.
Get right with God before it is tooo late and repent! ❤️❤️!
If don’t cheat on a test you might actually just have a mental disability tbh, I’ve been rocking my 4.0 because of cheating bad ethics win the race. Do everything for money that is all that matters
The last video on my feed was him forgetting to do work.
So one time my dad caught me cheating. He told me that I should never cheat, but if I do, don't get caught. I never got caught after that😂  Edit: before anyone tries to shit on me, it was in APUSH and I needed the class to graduate. In my school it was worth extra credits so it was either I redid my senior year, did summer school, or tortured myself in APUSH. To chose to torture myself
I cheated on a French test in 6th grade (Year 7 for me as I like in England) as I went on my phone for 2 answers;the word fish and a whole sentence. I’m one of the smarter kids in my form (half of us are in higher classes) and I never got full marks before so I knew that cheating would not give me that high score
Too easy
Sooooo time to say when I cheated so I was doing a spelling test in kindergarten and I forgot how to spell why so I just write whatever I thought on my paper then when I was about to turn it in I looked at another kids paper and copied how they spelt why because it looked right I ended up getting 100 and I never cheated again unless cheating counts as me and my friends discussing the answer during the test
I used to suck at math a few year ago and for some reason every time we had a test the teacher would tell the class the kid who got the best score and the kid who got the worst score.
Nah bro I do that on a science test and it was in Spanish so my teacher thinks we can remember 3 whole pages for the test so we just wrote down the answers and it’s with my friends then she said you know what just take out the answers papers so we fine🤝
I got 12|12
I’m in one of the smartest classes in school and we all cheat😂
the lesson here is that you only tell school secrets with the boys
I was the smartest one on class because I knew how to actually cheat
I caught my crush cheating and I still haven’t said anything
my teacher is like "iT DonT mAttEr AbT tHe hIghESt" girl i get highway everytome I WABNA BE PROUD
I'm one of the smarter ones in my class too (like I get usually grades from B to A). But there's this one girl (she's beautiful btw), who makes me feel dumb. Mainly when she answers correctly to a question I wouldn't have known the answer to (real English?)
I'm still in school lol and yeah I'm the smart kid in my class but yes I do cheat on very hard tests lol
I've never related more
As I girl I have an excellent way of cheating (I don't cheat but if I wanted to I could hide it here). So I wear a uniform that has a skirt. I just roll my skirt up, put cheat sheet under the skirt and go.  I don't think it would work but still-
This was me bruh but i didn't put it inside a pen I asked the others bruh and I was also the smartest kid..... :)
I'm called the "innocent" kid in school XD
Doesn't work like that in Poland
Jppp
10
9
B
A
This is very relatable
I was so smart like A+ all the times until I started to pay less attention and started to get B+ /B- which is good but like it’s a kinda big difference
Just imagine that your teacher seen this and found out that you was cheating
Top 2 kids in the class of 500 people, twins, cheated on almost every test and we all knew it. They were shit talked at graduation
If you think about it he was the smarter one, except when he told everyone about it
Same I was the smartest kid in class and then later gave up
Hello hello hello
Tbh I feel like everyone just slowly starts giving up cause the school stuff just gives pretty much the same stuff like what's the point of super complicated math when you could pretty much easily get the same answers with out using anything but multiplication and adding and subtracting with out it being to long like 10,000  or 400
Lmfao, i did to the 9th grade
Bro same at the start in math and English I was really good (English isnt my main language) I remember like two times where for homework I was the only one who raised the hand when the teacher asked who did answered the last problem and for English I basically was bilingual cus at a young age I watched English youtubers on my mom's laptop and learned English and somehow knew words I havent even heard of I just knew them
Seen it, im the one who helped the all A straight student on a math test after trying to help him day before the test and he did not understand it after an out of me trying to explain it
I started to give up in 5th grade, started cheating in online school 🤫
You can Cheat  You just can’t get caught
When they're actually smart and start cheating you're in trouble
Plot twist: They were just mad amount you cheating by yourself and not helping them.
pretty accurate
I know a guy named Jack, I'll introduce you to him
Ummmm thats whats happening to me right now except i have not cheated. Like last year i had a project in history and i was forced to do all the work on my own 🥲 i was betrayed
I wanted to cheat once BUT 💅🏿 I didn't.
bro I can relate to thats first part so much
I'm the smartest in class and never cheated
There was once a blackout in school during a test and it was on the moon phases.. I didn't know anything so I went over to the next smartest kid as I was the smartest, my best friend. I looked on his test paper while everyone was standing up and freaking out.. Then I went back to my paper and wrote it down. No one ever knew and no one ever noticed until a few years later when I told them lmao.
How did you cheat you wrote  the answer  but you knew
I honestly wouldnt care if annyone cheated on a test
I was the probably smarter and excel in science and math, so I was considered as one of the smart kid in class. But I'm so bad at History because of how much politics had factored in and I hate it so much.  I cheated the first time when I was 16 and I also got caught... And never cheated again, but I do help other cheat in chemistry and physics tho.
I cheated and hit good grades on online school but the other teacher,not so much
Today was a exam day at my school a girl wrote answers in her hands and she told her friend about it and guess what her friend told the teacher she was cheating n she got caught.  After school I was just telling my friends that u should not trust anyone n then I came across this video 😂
In 2nd grade, I was probably the 1st or 2nd smartest in class but we started doing multiplication because it was towards the end of the year and our class finished everything else. So I actually looked at some kids test by me and I think they saw me and hate me till this day- litterly we're kinda enemies
Yeah I feel this but it started in about 9th for me but damn being tall helps a lot with cheating.
When I cheat I’m always afraid the teacher will do exactly this, but it’s thankfully never happened before so far 😃
Yo- i have dat same pen-
Really no care if you cheat on test now days
😁
you knew the whole class is frick up when the smart kid start crying after seeing his grade
I always intentionally get answers wrong when I do that, because I'm not tryna get unwanted attention
In 5th grade there was a girl called salma i saw her talking to someone and the girl what telling her the answers i was literally disgusted and wireded out  ( the teacher was in the bathroom) 👁👄👁
I was the smartest too but I gave 1 dollar per answer so I gave away 20 dollars even though I could do it myself. I got scammed
I cheated on a science project test thingy and took a picture of the answers and did it at home
Even if we're the "smart kids" I think we can all agree we've cheated on a test atleast once 😂
we had a test and uhm i cheated and i got the nerds test and copied it- (i got caught btw and i was in 2nd grade💀)
Haha!!! Dont worry boi since grade 2 i have seena  popular kid as smart and Very lazy and He allowed me to copy his exam hehhe and im a very lazyyyy Kid sincs grade 1 i never write but do drawing and i Passed!!!!!
I cheated in a test with 2 boys who were right next to me XD
me to
Well, I have a story. yesterday we had a science test and my bestie was sitting in front of me and the girl that we secretly hate was sitting like far away from us but in my line and a boy was sitting behind me so in a question I didn't know i asked my bestie and i couldn't hear her so she took my paper and she gave me hers while the teacher wasn't looking no one saw that she said she's done writing the answer and i said drop it i dropped hers at the same time as she dropped mine we cought it and the boy sitting behind me and the girl we hate saw it and they started laughing the girl almost snitched on us but I shushed her.
I'm one of the smarter kids in school but im bored of it nothing hard to do
Same bro same
One of the smartest kids in my class cheated in a recent test. One of his friends told me.
Instead of “don’t cheat”a better word of advice is “don’t get caught”
I have a geometry test coming up thanks for the help on how to pass it 😁👍
Why are y'all intelligent
Why are y'all intelligent
i hade a bio test 10 days ago and the smartes student in our class just pulled out her book to cheat and didnt even hide it  Its almost like she wanted to get caught
If you ain’t cheating you ain’t trying
Or you got better grade than someone you cheated.....
This man sells more caps than Nike.
Cheating might get you through school but youll regret it for the rest of your life
I never technically "cheated" I would just happen to overhear some other people's conversations after they took their test about the test and use it to figure the subjects out. I didn't remember the processes a lot, so that's basically how I've gotten through school (minus math, I've always been good with that)
Bruh I remember in 3rd grade, 2 of my classmates (also my acquaintances) cheated on a test and no one knew except me and them lol.
bro u just discribed my day im in 7th grade too
If I look at another persons test it’s to see how far they are idk why but I feel like if the person sitting next to me is farther in a test, then I’ll feel dumb and then I hurry up and get the right answers
I got away with cheating on the semester test this year. I got 94 and it was the highest grade throughout all the 8 classes
omg same
As a smart kid, I don’t cheat but I am put under a ton of stress. Something I wish I had never tried in the first place was pushing people on a tire swing at my school- I put my self under too much pressure and kids aren’t grateful.
Great Video!!! I Liked and Subscribed!!!
Im currently in 7th and legit in every grade up until now i did great. I went from makin all A's to makin C's idk what happend lol
I’ve cheated a couple times this year, but I’m usually considered the smartest kid. My friends were disgusted
My mom being proud of me for having a good grade in French   Me :
The fact my teacher let me cheat but only if the paper was 2 by 2 cm
One of our Biology teachers always chose his tests from the Internet that were already prepared. All one had to do was find it and simply complete the tasks. And basically everyone started asking me for answers in advance before the test. Ironically, I started charging people for it at one point, and I wrote the answers in such small letters, as I managed to fit all of them in a small sheet of paper for both variants, that they were just not bothered to deal with that.
“ *don’t tell anyone else-* “  **proceeds to tell everyone in YouTube**
The only reason I passed 7th grade was cuz I had my bestie google to help me
Our valedictorian taped his phone to the wall in front t of him on a virtual test and used a different phone in frame when the teacher asked to see his phone
No dont cheat you loser
Nah when I saw the smart kid cheat, I knew I was screwed because the smart kid is cheating
I'm one of the smarter kids in class at least, I'm actually in 7th grade right now. I've never cheated, last year does not count with zoom because that was some bullshit and I cheated so much just to get at least Cs.
I was and still am one of the smartest kids in my class. And while for a lot of tests I'd prepared beforehand, there were a few exceptions where I needed to cheat. The test I'm talking in particular is a test about Automated Systems - a subject we have. We covered about three modules and the teacher decided to do a test and while for half and more I answered it from knowledge and what I'd learned previously, there were questions where I had to resort to cheating. But I mean, I didn't feel bad because the entire class cheated on the test.
I cheated my way to where i am right now because the last time i did math was in in 6th grade
“I just did my work.” Bro that’s so relatable. Everybody looked at me like I was Albert Einstein bro. I just did my work.
i was like THE best in school in 1st 2nd and 3rd grade then….. i no nothing man im dumb now
This year we had some sort of Spanish test on the Spanish Speaking countries I think…since I’m a nerd, I studied like I totally ever do (I don’t). And obviously got a 100. Then this girl next to me went like “How did you get a 100, I literally cheated and got a 52” (some stupid glitch happened where if you got 1 match wrong you got all of it wrong) and I just found that hilarious.
The other day we had a sub and he gave us all the answers to the test one of my peers kept trying to tell the sub. We didn’t like him for awhile. We still got all the answers though :)
Same dude
Im beginning to be a god in maths in high school, never been, im amazed
Ok I will cheat
I'd do something way smarter is there be special group go with second teacher that helps us, she would read the test. I would look at everybody as she read it and she read the answer choices which most people would stop on that answer choice as she was talking and pick that answer. that's how I knew which one to pick.
One day it was 1 grade and we had an eng test soo there was a photo of a computer but the teacher said its not a computer so i cheated from my best friend and i got a good grade soo ya it was right my best friends answer
Me too
yea and when u get work u dont know how to do it bc u cheated 😂😂
im a quiet kid in class so everyone thinks i know how to do everything but… I don’t  a lot of people when needing help will say like “ hey, your smart right?” or “ask her shes smart”
So, in school is the smartest kid infront of my seat, at the wall side, She leans on the wall so i see what she writes🤣
Valedictorian and soludictotian at my school cheated. Everyone knew it too, even admin but they still got to do their speech lmao.
idk, in my school we beat snitches
"Later on the later years I slowly started giving up" I am related to this somehow hahahha
You no in school I used to sit next to the smartest kid in  the class and what he did was coping the bord how because they whold tell the answers and we whold mark it so he did not do work he copied it
Bro my whole stem class cheats on every test with our phones our last one only half of the class cheated including me and I still got the lowest mark 34%
its true tho,now its happening for me when im on 1st grade to 6th grade i always at rangk 3+ and didnt cheat,asking someone for answer and giving someone answer.but now im on 7th grade i feel im more stupid or it just the test so hard,now i asking someone answer and giving someone answer lol
It's alright. Don't lie, everyone had cheated on a test before.
You know what's funny I did exactly the same thing before I saw this video yesterday hahahah
Tried to cheat once by writing the answer to a question on the bottom of my arm teacher didn't notice and I would have been able to get away with it until someone snitched on me
I usualy just make the same cheat to my bestie and told her
I'm always cheating in math class
* testing but everything is something you forgot * Ah shi- * Flips notebook back and cheats * Wha- * sees the row beside me looking at me * WHAT!?
Wtf it's like you know, yesterday recently I cheated on the test (i am one of the smart kids ig) and the teacher caught me 😃 so now I'm getting well idk. Anyways just wanted to say that since this story was so relatable
i remember one time in 5th grade, i saw the girl next to me putting a cheat sheet under her backpack, putting her [CLEAR] backpack next to her. I could still see the cheat sheet, and so could’ve anyone else. I just brush it off because i knew the answers to the test, she didn’t. Well, i look back a few minutes later because i hear something, and she’s wimping and crying because she still can’t figure it out. I got one wrong, she got half the paper wrong. I would’ve told the teacher she cheated, but i felt sorry for her.
Im giving to lol
I cheat but the thing my math teacher give us. Like she gives 9×186 IM IN 4TH GRADE
This is exactly the problem, they always expect great of you
Am grade seven and am 13 years old am not really the smartest kid in class but am an average student and I never cheat in tests
"I slowly started giving up." Why is this so true?
Your room looks good.
i cheated on a test and failed
I can get good grades as long as I'm doing in school instead of cyber or virtual lol
Imagine being the smart kid
only tests I never have to cheat in is math I’m just somehow good at math but I hear other people hate math personally I love it
Later on I found out that 2 of the smartest kids in my class I have been cheating on their tests
Yo same
I am giving up slowly in school but I HAVE TO KEEP GOING but I don't cheat
Yeah bragging is like the top of the dont do list
Me in the spelling bee because i got the full grade on All tests:*fails first round🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
In the seventh grade, I was one of the best in all my classes. No one knew that though so when some kid figured out i got straight A's he always came to me for answers. I dunno why but I gave them to him, for some reason it made me feel useful
I never cheated on a test. But on homework when I was in 6 grade.
Similar thing here. I cheated on every small assignment we got, but never a quiz or test. One time, the person who cheated with me told this one person during a quiz what I did (i was objecting the whole time). One day, during a quick quiz, I didnt cheat but I was the only person in class with a perfect score. The teacher, of course, made certain everyone knew this. The person who was told yelled very loudly, "THAT WASN'T FAIR, HE CHEATED," which I respond with, "I swear to got I didn't cheat this time." No point lying, it would just add more weight to my soul. I got sent to the principals office and had to tell exactly how it was done. I got no punishments though, because the public school systems suck.   This was also the same principal who called all of the boys to the office to tell us every single word we weren't supposed to say. Explicitly. With no filter.
MILK
This video is kind of ironic because I literally just cheated on my entire final for science and told my best friend MMMMM we’ll see
"I just didn't know Jack"   Me: who's Jack?   Guess I don't know him either...
I can't relate cause...yeah all of us were cheating and the whole class has each other's answers almost
had a science test today knew i was gonna fail, my table checked answers and i cheated by using my notes, 😂 nobody cared
Don’t cheat on a test because years later you have to get that degree
Yes it was a science test he wrote the answers on his jeans and after the test he went to the bathroom and washed it off
Too easy
Bruh is that the class from ddlc
I look I’ve the ending, when you said don’t cheat and if you do keep it to your self
bro you gotta cheat on tests you don't understand, there is simply no way around it that I know of.
Me to
Same dude, I’m pretty sure I never was the smartest kid on the class but I was one of the smart ones, than I just couldn’t keep up with all the sh|t being throw at me  Now I’m at recovery
Eight hundreth
Everybody gangsta till the teacher gives you a random similar question cuz you were the one who got it right
One time I cheated on my spelling test by writing the hard words down on my desk (I got a C tho 🥲)
I never thought of that before but I do have an exam tomorrow so I feel I might do this
Me and you are exactly the same other than the cheating part
Cheating in tests last year in virtual class was so easy any time I forgot got to study I just simply got into the chrome system opened up a new chrome browser then searched the answers there, if I looked in my phone I would get caught.
This happened to me 🥲🥲🥲
I was really smart in class untill this year then i gave up completely lmao
I've always been the smartest person in my grade but I suck at spelling but nobody Knew that so when They saw me cheating everyone was so confused and thought they were going to fail the test coz I was cheating even though it was a simple test
Yeah I ex experience that and he's doing it on my test paper
How do you giys actually cheat on a test? Do you guys know what the question is? Do your teacher tell you which chapter is gonna be in the test? Like how?
same.
Literally just watched elfs today in music
I am known as the smartest kid in class right now and I have not cheated once THIS YEAR
So you cheated on your test well well im calling your mom.
I think it’s too late because I already cheated on a test
Literally my life in school as well Except I cheated in highschool
Omg SAME
Too easy
“You sit on a throne of lies” THAT REALLY JUST SENT ME 💀 💀 💀
Well in my french class we are all absolutely freaking stupid
You can cheat on a test, but learn something from it
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes q😱
It isn’t cheating, you simply came up with a strategy to take out the hard tiring battle!
Me too
How can you cheat tho ? You don’t know the questions till you get to test ? Smh
Listen if I'm going to have to take a test of 48 pages after trying to study 19 pages and having to remember the exact dates places and time there's no way I'm not cheating
I'm not a smart person, merely a clever idiot.  and even tho not once have I studied for a test, I have never failed a test
Im known as the quiet kid in my school.
you know what they say “cheating isn’t cheating till you get caught”
YES. I was also considered the smart kid in class until I got older! In 1st-3rd I got straight As, then I didn’t know crap!
Today I had a math test and one of my best friends sits next to me so we helped each other out a bit. 😂😅
Theres a kid in my class who cheats a lot, its an open secret with people joking about it. The teachers know but they need proof to do anything. Hes told me how he does it multiple times and its intressting, he is smart since he comes upp with such clever ways each test
In college I was forced to because a programming curriculum that was introduced was so broken you had to submit broken code to count it (I wish i was lying.) perfect code submitted and flagged because it decided a semi colon wasn’t important, etc  I was gonna skip it all together but it was 75% of my grade in the end. That was probably the most painful thing I’ve ever done in my academic experience.
Oh yeah a smart kid cheated on a Macedonian test that nobody even knew how to speak Macedonian and then the teacher caught hem cheating others did it too.
You look like glitch YT
What's the fucking hell fucking bro
Why is always 7th grade
Me too I did the same thing
The ten Commandments: Will you go to heaven after you die? "For whoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all" (James 2:10). You have to face the Holy God on judgment day. He sees lust as adultery (Matt 5:28) and hatred as murder ( 1 John 3:15). Will you be guilty? Jesus took your punishment on the cross, and rose again, defeating death, to save you from Hell. Repent (Luke 13:5) and trust in him today. " For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life"( .(John 3:16)
Have you ever seen someone run out his last lesson in half way and ckem back in 1 minut yup that's me for my fucking YouTube channel after 1 minut I told them sorry
100% me rn.
I had a really young science teacher that knew about this trick so any time we would take a test we would have to take everything off our desk and you HAD to use a wooden pencil. I couldn’t fail this test and I didn’t study so I wrote all of the formulas on my arm(I obviously had on long sleeves) and since I was a pretty good kid the teacher probably never really expected cheating from me.
The straight A kid was l9oking at my test once I GET C'S AND STUFF
I am the smartest kid in my class and I keeps cheating XD
Yes
I’m the smart person in my class. People used to ask me the answer to everything. This year I found a way to stop them asking. I just said “if u want an answer it cost 10 cent. Suddenly people stopped asking.  Now they just look in.👀🤦‍♀️
I usually come at the 2nd or 3rd place/rank. In Online Classes, I did a bit of cheating. My other 'Topper/Smart' friends actually caught me somehow. They were disgusted of me untill I got a good grade in offline  classes
"you bow down to my throne, unaware it is born of lies" ~ some sh*tpost about cheating on essays
Literally happened yesterday, she got a one day suspension and an automatic 0
I'm just thinking if you cheat using the paper in the pen how do you know the answers and the questions on the test?
Of course I know him, he’s me.
Cheating is inherently a bad thing to do no matter the reason, but I think it was very hypocritical of your classmates to judge you for it. Sure, they might be surprised, shocked even, but they shouldn't have been disgusted or mad about it when, according to you, some of them were also cheating. I don't, I think that's how I would react in that situation.
Nah things here are different. If i tell anyone i am cheating every one will be like okay help us then after you done cheating show me the anwers also.
im just like ya
Bruh my class thinks that I am super dumb and I am really smart and never got low grades and they where all like yep you just cheat every time you are just to good at ceting
Disgust na man my friend would ask me for the cheat after im done with it, even the smartest in my class cheat as long as we share the cheat everything is ok
My friends Aren't the type to betray, And if they do they had to run from my mp5 silencer.
Well I am right now in third grade and I am the smartest kid but I cheated a little on my exams 📝 and I am smart even tho I cheated on my exams 😆
I get called to be the smartest girl in class and my class calls me 'sister' so I feel awkward alot but ehh atleast no disturbence
In school if someone in class do something bad none of us would tell on them because we don't tell on eachother even if we know who did it
Around month ago, one of the smartest kids in class was planning to cheat on test. (We were learning Russian language). The test was easy, but he didn't change his mind. In the end, teacher caught him. And that's how he got his first F. P. S. He wasn't the only kid who cheated.
Same brother you and me same story
What's even funnier is when you cheat on a test but get lower than average😂
“For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” Romans 6:23
Bro anyone can get perfect scores now just need a extra device
BRUH we had a math test and the person who sits next to me was cheating off of me and it was so obvious and i would look at her paper and she would always be on the same question as me and when i would wright she would wright i didn’t say anything tho 😢😳
I remember when my cheating plan is pretty obvious but my teacher still didnt notice it
Mr. Smith looking at this rn: 👁👄👁
Are ur friends enemies or friends cuz we all cheat on paper together and we tell eachother eveb the smart kids cheat normally and every1 finds it normal
I guess I'm just like you in middle school I love studying but then when my pre teen years come that love started declining and now I'm an average weeb memer depressed 15 year old
Same thing with me
Too easy
I will only cheat on online or if I genuinely don’t know what the word
our geography teacher lets us cheat we just write everything in the atlas
If I see the smartest kid in class cheat?  Well The entire class  would look like  Literally everyone:OH HELL NAH,WERE LEAVING   Reason:ITS THE SMART KID HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE SMART KID CHEAT!?
Once I was in 4 grade I had my english test and the girl who use to top ever time she sat in front of me while we were doing the test I saw that girl she had opened har bag put the book above it and was cheating I felt so betrayed I can't imagine I still remember that story and now I am on 8th grade and that girl is no longer in our school 😂
I was the exact same way except I didnt cheat
How did you manage to get the answers before the test
Yeah same
I wouldn’t cheat because I ain’t tryna get in trouble and noticed for that
🅻🅾🖤🅴 is a drug  💊 that I quit 🙅 No doctor 👨‍⚕️ could help when I'm 𝕝𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕤𝕚𝕔𝕜 💗 😷
Lol 😹
Ayo same over here
Bro I’m using this
Moral of the story: If you cheat on a test don't tell ANYONE, they might betray you
My exact problem if given up on life.
Same
“I just did my work”  I’m only passing because of our daily assignments. I mainly do bad on the tests, but people think I’m smart cause they somehow got a 4 in P.E
Same thing except i didnt cheat, i didnt know jacked shit in year 7 and basically flunked math by getting a D grade. Before year 7 i aced every test with at least a B 😂😂😂
I have no friends so that should be easy
The body heals part I was watching buddy the elf at this time when I was watching this😱
My life story here I am also in 7th and I do this with my crazy (but really good at math)friend
That's a good idea
I mean I've only cheated once. It was this year and I'm learning Japanese, at my school it's mandated up until year 9 but I know I'll be doing it long past then. I had trouble remembering some of the word's spelling, some of them have two i's at the end and I wasn't remembering quite well so during the 5 minute revision, I wrote on my fingers the 5 words I needed to remember, or at least wrote a bit of each letter, then got back to revising. I didn't even need the fingers, I aced the test. When I get home I get to see my grades and I already know that like my last report card I'm going to get an A in Japanese. Mostly because I got the year level award for Japanese so I'm very good to be recognised as the best out of the 100 students in my year level.
I FEEL YOU, IN 5TH GRADE I GOT SO FED UP THAT I DIDN'T CARE IF I GET A BAD GRADE (I still studied tho,also I have a quiz friday if I pass i can be in the party with the rest of the class were there wil be cake and ice cream so please pray for me I want the food
Same
Me 2
Omg I cheated on in the second grade spelling test but I told no one and I got three trophies at the end of the year 😜
I’m a smart kid and I cheat all the time. Not fucking work the memorizing the formulas etc
I was witching elf😂😂
cheat, just don’t tell anyone. 😉
I’m the opposite I had bad grades at first but now I have all As! Unfortunately that’s not good enough for me I need all 100+
Im the smarter in the class
Honestly that's a really relatable story I meant to say that's a life lesson of not to cheat yeah.
I have a problem with memory and I had a test where I had to memorize the stats. I tried to study but either I forgot to study or the studying didn't work. I made my home screen on my phone a map of the US and turned down my brightness. It worked and only one person I know off saw me cheat but I just let them copy.
Ok ok good strategy but....HOW DID YOU GET THW TEST AWNSERS?!
I had a cheat sheet for a test in my cubby that has a hole and they removed it before the test and I was screwed
I’m definitely one of the top 10 smartest kids at my school (if you count smart by grades) And I cheat a lot and half the time I know it but I’m scared I don’t do I cheat
Not me wearing the same exact sweatshirt as him while watching this video
I can relate to being “smart” in primary school then about when I hit year 8/9 my brain just decided to piss off and go “do it ur self”
That happened to me!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭
My friend he is supposed to be the "smartest student in 5th grade" he is now getting from 100 to 50s and 40s I'm starting to think he is cheating on every test because when I got back to school he was doing so good then his grades dropped
Ye since the 9th grade I've been giving up on everything
I guess I am considered one of the "smart kids" so I always make mistakes on test and I hate it. They are all so simple, such as one where the answer was 41.2 but I put 40.12. It is so annoying
Story time: One time I was stuck in a question in the social studies exam so one of my friend helped me But ONE OF THE GIRLS JUST LOOKED AT ME AND. I WAS LIKE (I FUCKED UP MATE) THEN SHE SMILED AND I WAS in my mind (WAIT YOU MADE ME NERVOUS FOR NOTHING) Thank you for reading
I did the same thing... I used to cheat alot more and then I became a king of cheating
NO LETS BEAT THE HORCHATAS
I did once or twice back in kindergarten
I never cheated on test till college and I not only cheated on assignments but I helped others cheat to
I'll never cheat no need
almost all of the smart kids in my first and third period cheat and give others the answers 😭  including me
Blue
Yea there’s a really smart kid but she didn’t cheat
Imagine his teacher saw this😆
Bruh how did he not get perfect while cheating
One time in fifth grade I was minding my own business and we had a test and I got pretty far into it until someone asked me what's 4 x 11 I ignore it until I eventually look down and find out the answer 44, but turns out there was a multiplication chart under my desk so he thought I was cheating but eventually The substitute comes and takes the paper out of my desk and she turns to me and says" I can't believe you had this" but at the time I did not know how to use a multiplication chart so I tell her and she says " that answer isn't enough"and so she puts it on my teacher's desk and my teacher says nothing about it until this day I still don't know what she did with that information 🤣🤣🤣🤣 School s Stories
I cheated today
To easy
"In the later years I was giving up" same
1 lol
THIS IS ME😭
No the smart kid never cheated on a test
Relatable, except it just started in high school for me
Him: Keep it to yourself Also him: tells a million people on the internet
I always  cheat on test
Same tho
i was a smart kid in class until i just lost all of my knowledge
Well it was my test today and I helped my friend cheat
I remember that elf scene. He said the Santa smelt like beef and cheese
Everyone thought I would drop out and end up in prison. They based that off my last name. My great grandfather was a famous bank robber and member of mafia, babyface nelson was member of his crew! Anyways shocked the hell out of everybody when I graduated with honors!
I was the smart kid and “helped” people, there was this one test I knew nothing and suddenly the guy behind me just started whispering me the answers
Thats me
In my klass before there was this one kid who was I’m the best  everyone thought she was the best when all she did was count fast and sometimes wrong like I can’t do anything because after a very short time my add starts kicking in
I cheat a lot in the class but my classmates are chill they don't say anything they laugh instead 😂✌️ I'm lucky
I remember when the smartest kid in class of ours was just reading a book during an exam wich was kinda stupid and one of my best friends shouting "Ngiiiii si _____ kay nag cheat" wich translate to oooo _____ is cheating and she keeps saying no and saying she was just reading the book and my friend also keeps saying shes cheating on the test until she cried lol
You can cheat but dont get court
This is me
Me who cheats almost everyday :👁👄👁
GOOOOLD. I CHEAT BY HIDING A MSALLER NOTE BEHIND THE TEST IT WOURKS ALLWAYES. GOOOOOLD
Yes the smartest kid on 4th on my class she threatened the kid next to her idk the threat but she said give ur answers or else and i was at the back of them
I currently going through the stuff u went through exactly how u did all those years ago.
Everybody gangsta until the smart kid starts crying at the exam
It’s always the good kids ended up being bad kid in disguise
Well if you’re smart you should know that you shouldn’t tell other students that you’re cheating…
Well if you’re smart you should know that you shouldn’t tell other students that you’re cheating…
Sorry boys my throne is made of memes.
SSHSHSHSHSHSHHSHSHHHHH
God Bless ❤️
I feel u man same thing happened to me 😔
But I don’t cheat
That’s me
I feel like this is true for everyone, jus take away the smart jus part for some
well i all ready learned my lesson
Hi
This probably feels weird to say, but uhh i usually do teamworks with the boys on the back hahahaha
E
I used google translate on an in person spanish test and didn’t get caught lmfao
.
I literally cheated on my test today 😹😹🤣🤣🤣
I one remember when I was 12. I helped a kid that's a in a higher class than me   At English.
Its not cheating if the whole class also did it, exam is one of my favorite thing in school, because i can make a lot of money by selling my answer to my classmate, and the method that i use to pass the answer is by writing it on a piece of tissue instead of paper so it will be easier to cover if the the teacher or someone who doesnt buy the answer from me see.
Pov:The smartest girl in class sit next to you and she gives you a paper during tests
I never cheated and my parents were nice enough to tell me or gave a lecture for the answers to the ones I got wrong so I can understand it😇 I feel ashamed tho🤣😂
And yes i sit on a throne of lies
Quite the coincidence  im in 7th grade and im that one "smarter" kid who cheats and helps EVERYBODY pass and no teachers know
Das not your friend boi and never was saw my crush cheating and say didn’t shit
Oh. Don't keep it to myself? Ok!  "Hey did you know that I looked at your paper and cheated? Yeah! You didn't even notice!"  That's what I'm supposed to say, right?
WHY WHY THE VIDEO IS EXACTLY 59 SECONDS OMG
Who's jack btw??
Dude same I’m in 7th grade right now and in the exact same situation
This is true because some people cheated on a science test and the whole grade had re-do the test just because they decided they would tell the the teacher 💀
I just started getting lower grades like you did
I was pretty smart in school and I decided that in would cheat on this one test for the first time. I told my friend and eventually the whole class knew and everyone thought that I wasn’t actually smart and that in have been cheating in all my tests.  Lesson: people are jerks
Yes
Moral of the story is to never forget jack.
I was considered one of the smartest kid on school, and then on 3rd grade i start struggling, and then since 4rth grade I've now become one of the shittiest students. I am now currently on 7th grade, im on online school. I haven't done anything, like literally, I've done nothing. I missed zoom, missed homework, everything Wow, what a downgrade ive had
U make the funniest vids it lights up my day 🙂 u could b a comedian w some more practice
Cheating on Spanish is okay though. Right?
BRO THIS IS EXACTLY ME
Your teacher sees this
When we swap sits like girl boy girl boy pattern and guess what i see the girls beside me make a cheat sheet and i was surprise .
Man you a rookie bro. Everyone knows that you right the little piece of paper in the inside of a water bottle so when you pretend to drink it you can see the notes
My friend had all the answer and gave me a paper of the answer then I was like ok I was going do the work and see if there right (all of them was right )so I got a 100
I've only ever cheated less than 10 times throughout my 12 years of school  But my parents, who I might as well say are Einstein of their batch, cheated more than my poor fingers can count
I was one of kinda smart kids and I’ve never cheated or studied….at least until COVID
I would just say hey hey you marked this wrong I should have gotten (lower grade).
Why was this me and one of my guy friends in science at the start of the year? 😬
I once got highest in my class during spelling b practice
Same
I was the smartest kid in class
don't cheat, I'm in 11th grade now, didn't cheat in the past and I'm not going to
What is with all the Elf references these days 😂
I honestly just passed science class because I cheated. And I'm not friends with anybody so there was no one to tell.
These days the teacher would know if we where cheating since they have a program where they can see my screen.
This was meeeee :D
One time in 7th grade, we had a Geography test to name every country in Africa, and you know, it's Africa, there's a lot of countries with weird/obscure names. And so I had my map of Africa that we did for that chapter in my desk, and did get away with it twchnically, I successfully did it while using the map when I needed to, but then after I told somebody that I THOUGHT I trusted enough, and thennn they told the teacher and I had to redo the test. Honestly though thank God it wasn't just an immediate 0
Gifted kid burn out syndrome is what got me and my sister
Same bro
The problem is when someone messes up the scale because they got the questions all right
Me and my freind have multiple times , popped out our phone and Google searched the answer and wrote it down . And got away with is so many times
Guys pls listen to me, this is important. Jesus is coming very soon for the Rapture/Judgement day. So that means we need to Repent from our sins, live for God on a daily basis, and spread the word of God (the Gospel) Let’s make Heaven crowded! We need to act NOW. Amen✨🥰😊🤗❤️
Yoooo feeel that
In my classes, no one cares if you cheat. If you need help just give a nudge and point and copy the answer sneakily. We all help each other lol.
Same here bruh
i cheat even when i know the answers sometimes
i remember in the 6th grade i would sit with this girl and we were two of the ‘smarter kids.’ we would always help each other in tests it was quite fun
Too easy
i was the naughty and smart kid and wouls cheat somewhat but it was a two way cheat
Theres really no reason not to cheat, you're not hurting anyone you're just making it easier for yourself
Love the story but I had to watch like 3 times to concentrate without looking at jeans lol heep up the good work😁😁😁
Yup i will be sure to not do not do it anytime ☺️, as I am the so called "intelligent student"... And for those who are judging me that I am flexing please dont.
Same I just gave up
I had smart kid in my class and all he did was brag about how smart he is. He would say random facts about a whatever we were talking about. He was just annoying in everyway. It was time for the final 6th grade test and I saw him sneaking a piece a paper to cheat on. He found out I knew and paid me 40 bucks to not tell anyone.  Should I have still told other people?
im in 7th grade and cheat on most of my exams
"Its not cheating if you're not caught"
one of the smartest kids in class started cheating this year i don't know what happened with her but she asks another girls questions and helps others during tests
Tbh when my friends found out is chi so bad at math that I cheat half the time their faces were 😧 just that and kid in my class when he figured out he had a pig face on
In 11th grade some of us made a gc to help each other cause we gave up on life
I wouldn't call myself the smartest kid... But I've only cheated like once, and I didn't even need to! I was doing my maths test, any my calculator was shit, it only had a multiplication, division and addition option besides the numbers, so I borrowed my friends calculator and put in the equation, and the question was a strict non-calculator one, and guess what, I didn't even need to, because I had apparently gotten it right, though I asked my friend what they got, they said 5, I had 3, I put five, and Five minutes of my friend rapidly calculating later, turns out the calculator was wrong when I tried it! It WAS 3! So there was 30 seconds of rapid panicked whispering and changing answers because the teacher was collecting the papers
Man stop the cap
I cheated and this girl saw me so she told on me now I think she is one of the most annoying person I know
Yes, me
Dude why does the first half describe me so well. I was the “smart” kid 1st-5th grades and then to middle my brain went ‘aight imma head out’.
Same
I became the same way in 7th grade aswell
Is my class the only one who has every single student cheat on the test
Nice holister sweater
this guy loves himself
Too easy💪
I’m in 7th grade, and I’m giving up too XD
Lol a few weeks ago I saw the smart kid he's my friend searching answers on Google and I also sit next to the dumb funny girl lol
There's this one time on my 5th grade there were 5 smarties in my class and our desks were circle shaped and of course the 5 smarties sit together so that they can copy each other's answers😈👿
Hi
I am the smartest kid in my class and i am usually involved in complex cheating
If you haven't cheated on a test ur a weeb
the closest thing i got to cheating on a test was writing ONE WORD in my table because i couldnt memorize it
Sounds like me
Im not a gifted kid or somewhat for me i do struggle to succeed so i just took the wise way to succeed
This is me minus the cheating
Best student in my class is the best student bcs she is good at cheating
What do you mean I got all F I need to cheat
Im now 5Th Grade and I from the 1 grade  and up i am the best student in class
but I'm the smartest student And I didn't cheat
Too easy
This is literally me except i NEVER tell someone i cheated.
You

You are a replica of me woww I subscribed :)
Man im in high school and everybody cheats and even the teacher knows abd don't say anything 👌
Ok so I am in the seventh grade and yk all the online school stuff is going on.  So in 6th I was considered one of the best students and was popular with teachers and stuff but as time went by I slowly started to give up lol now in the seventh grade there was a exam going on and it was history and everyone knows how much I hate and suck at history so the exam was held on google forms and I was like "lemme copy this paste and it on google" and everything was going well and I was the first to finish so I asked the teacher that can I leave the meeting and the teacher knew very well how much I hated and again sucked ar history so she asked me "wow I am very surprised you finished the exam first May I ask how did you do it as your not very good at history?" and thats why I got caught in cheating..lol
In elementary school i was one of the smartest kids in class, i was doing my work etc, but in 6th grade everything changed like everyone wouldn't even care if someone cheats they would be like ✌️😩
Thanks for the tip for how cheat...
Lol they always do that like. Ummm no one needs to know my grades ms/sir
In high school rn, i m kind of the best in the class at that subject, so on a test when i decided to cheat and everybody found out, everybody just threw their materials and cheated to, saying fuck it if even He (me) does it, we ll do it all together :)
If you’re really smart you can cheat undetected
Yoo you so smart hahaha
I was also the consider the smarter kid but i started cheating because they were hard
I was also one of the smart kids on elemantary, then became one of the bad ones :P
I've cheated on Math before, AND LEMME TELL YA IT FELT GREAT
This girl that sits right next to me is always trying to make me stop cheating on things. But when her and her friend don’t know the answer I just casually think for a few seconds and get the correct answer.  They still don’t know why I cheat if I can easily get the answer lol
yep my friend was like is top 2 in our class and i was like hold up wait a minute you cheat'en and my friend was like you call it cheating i call it strategy and mw where both like 😂😂
Yeah I am still considered a smart student
Yea The smartest girl in class actually I need test like two days ago she was like I’m so can you tell me what you would like I wasn’t paying attention to school that much so can you bring a test until we can switch the name to be like now ce I got a hundred she got 53
Me and my friends learned sign language so that we could cheat easier, never been caught
my whole class cheated other thab that 1 kid
I was the same way I got dumb at around 5th grade.
I didn’t see it. I WAS it!😈 I used to fly thru school and then I got to yr 9 and started prepping for GCSEs… I would look over to my friend on the table next to me and she would mouth the answer. No one saw us tho 😁 I mean. It’s not bad unless your caught right?
In 2 grade if we played gold fish correctly then the teacher would give us 1 extra point
Bru who does tell people when they cheat i was considered smart but i got too dam lazy cause school work does be too much and now i does cheat but not all the time 🤣🤣
Same. Me too I got lazy.
Thanks now i can cheat on a test
Lol i don't need to cheat because im that one person who doesn't study for the test and still gets an A     Idk how tho
The same thing happened to me but only my best friend new
In Italy It's very normal to cheat, lime every test we do we cheat
Not related to the story: When i was at fifth grade i was so focused on class cause of family problems its like one of those Scholl years that id rather go to class than home to escape reality, so this one day i was so focus (im the quiet kid) that i remembered what the teacher is saying to us (about soil) and my science teacher ask us a question (i forgot thr question) the whole class shouted i think one of the titles on the yellow sheet of paper that is always so big and i shouted a different answer and it was awkward cause i thought im wrong and almost changed my answer but it was too late but then the science teacher told me im right and why im the only one right, Went on to miss 1 day on class and the science teacher apparently gave us a surprise test he didn't gave me one cause he forgot to bring one and im just too lazy to walk 4 stories building and going up again so i didnt go there again and my final grade is 87 that class teacher and that class is my favorite and got to 6th grade and our science teacher is pregnant and just gave us some monitor and the subject she missed 7 months on that class and that monitor screen is half way to me and i cant see shit and my mom and i went to get some glasses and apparently i have 1,2k eye grade and small Root on my eye so i only can go to my phone for 2-3 hours per day and i cant lift anything cause if that root pops im blind and then coronavirus and this eye problem makes me burn out and that burn out to laziness now im as stupid as a peanut
Me also
Why is this me?
The first time I ever cheated in a test was 5th grade. Well, I didn't cheat, I helped my friend cheat. I finished the assessment quite early so I earned free time, but since the others were still doing work I couldn't do anything. Coincidentally, my friend's table was near the bookshelf so I sat there and she asked for help. I told her to rip a piece of paper from her notebook, show me the question, and I'd fill the answers in the notebook. I came up with new answers so it wouldn't be same with mine. At one point the teacher saw me and just moved me asking what I was doing on the floor in a narrow gap between the table and shelf and I said I was accompanying my friend. She was almost done anyway and I don't think we were caught.  (The bookshelf was to make up for me reading)
I have I think one of the best tacks of cheating. So it works only for small test. So basically you write all the important things into on piece of paper, than take a photo of it, put it as you phone lock screen, and when ,out need it turn on you phone. Or maybe the same picture just that you open it with gallery, than put a black picture next to it, and when the teacher comes, turn to the black side, and it looks like it turned off... Boom
I saw the smartest kid in class cheat 1 time only
Bro I'm just in the average of class but I NEVER CHEAT even once in my life until now.  There's a story when I almost cheated, but yeahh then I put the wrong answer cz I'm feelingh guilty lol
Im currently going through that. :)
Our school topper used to cheat by putting notes in the washroom
Holy shit thats exactly me 😂
The teacher watching this:👁👄👁
I am totally the smartest kid in my class but you know i am Lazy . I started coughing at school, I didn't study for tests, I didn't do my homeworks and started cheating on tests. and when my classmates found out, they couldn't believe it that the nerd and the telltale became a cheater.😂
I have cheat on my online tests because I GAVE UP! I am one of the best students but... NOW OFFLINE TESTS??? I am getting an 18 and half of 25... for a subject.... WHICH I NEVER EVER GOT SO YEAH
Smart kid cheating for anyone=F
Yo
For my class , whenever the smartest kid cheated , IT WAS OVER , everyone knew the test was too goddamn hard , plus , the smartest studies 4 year over us Edit : I was the smart kid but I rarely chest , cuz , y know , 4 years
I don't know if this is considered cheating but one day, we were answering a daily exercise (true or false short test). Then I looked at the smart kid's paper and what she wrote on ALL numbers were; True/False. Like every.single.number. I always wondered how she always got perfect scores on those tests and the people who checked it (since we exchange papers so we can check it) didn't even inform the teacher. Her friend also did it. I told the her that it's cheating and she changed her answers 💀
I am the exact boy that u were from 1st grade to 6th
Yep I am excatly like u but never got caught
I’d put the answer sheet under my test so when the sun shined through it it would reveal the answers.  It was good for like, when I sat behind windows, but a kid saw me and called me a dumbass. So I sabotaged his shit and called him an imbicile shitfuck.  War was over, it was clear I had won insult battle 😎 but I never used that cheat again. Because half the time I wasn’t sitting near a window, and I was personally very hurt from him calling me a dumbass.   I was an emotional child ok—
Youd be a good actor in mr iglesias
Yo I passed a test because someone gave me test answers
Just remember cheating and not getting caught technically still make you pretty smart
Man I’m the same thing my friends all say I’m smart well I kind of am I get the like 3rd best grades in class and then they are just like one your so smart and tells the whole class omg he’s so smart and it’s just kind of embarrassing ngl
I have ceated durring one test when i was really young but i didnt prepere for ceating they just had a poster with some of the answers up
One time me and my friend cheated on the same test (we were sitting next to each other) using our other friends study guide (who copied the answers from someone in their class) which we were allowed to use on the test.. we passed the study guide to each other and even wrote down questions for each other, and our teacher never caught us. Funniest part about it, both of us got a higher score than our friend who did the study guide.
In my class we take "Team work makes the dream work" very seriously  I mean my bff is sharing his GF with me 🙃 he doesn't know it yet 🙂
Idk why I was gonna cheat on this test even though im the smartest kid in my class i wanted to ry cheating, anyway the study guide she put on Google classroom i put all of the notes on my hand written and a index card that I put up my sleeve and the test was not even a percent close to the study guide.
I was the smartest kid in class in 6th grade. We had a history test and I didn’t study. So in the middle of the class I took out my textbook and was reading my answers. One of my friends noticed and was like “What are you doing?” My reply was “I’m simply just studying in the middle of the test.”  He DIED laughing and somehow no one else noticed. I got an A+ on the test. Lol🤣
Bro I got the highest grade on a test and I was like 👁👄👁 I was at failing point last year
If the smartest kid in class cheats on the test, thats either an indicator that all hope is lost, or they sit on a throne of lies.
One of the smartest kids in class cheated off of my test in french class. We planned it ahead lolol
In my class we literally al cheat and help eachother and we all know that
It’s crazy me and my friend are considered the smartest in our class yet both of us are really stupid at the same time and the only reason we always get every assignment done is because we work together and use calculators
Back In 3rd grade Somebody named Meer in my class and he told the teacher he has a great cheat 😂  I mean like who just tells their teacher that they cheat 😂
I only cheated once on a test and I was a smart kid
Too easy
DONT CHEAT
What's wrong with you guys. When we cheat literally everyone knows about it including the teacher. Our entire class cheats together. Or I should say used to cause it's been 1.8 years
to all the 'not-smartest' people here, we don't cheat because we don't know, we cheat because we are to nervous that we're going to fail horribly even though it probably won't
You aren’t smart if you’ve haven’t cheated once I speak from experience
In like 2nd grade we were doing a standardized test. I was doing the math section and I looked over at my really smart friends paper because I had no clue of the answer. As soon as I saw her answer (it was multiple choice) I was like hell nah and just did it myself. I was the only kid to get 100% on it
Same
Bro they not a friend if they tell everybody your cheating on a test
Now see here is the thing if it was like final exams or mid terms then i was very serious about it but tests can burn in hell
I cheated pack in 1 to 2nd grade but then it just started getting easier to y'know actually learn and do well
I got jumped in the 4th grade before
A couple times I needed to do a test at home and I got a tutor for math and every math test they did they only got a 70% relatively even though the tutor was a teacher of the same subject
See now cheating is impossible because our teacher never let us see the test
My class's topper cheated from me😂😂😂🤔
There is this one time in my english test and i was totally not prepared so I was the favorite student of our teacher and sitting in in the first bench i opned the copy and wrote and also git the highest and tge teachet said that i was the best student that look of the whole class I'll never forget
In my class we help each other cheat
7th grade is when you usaaly give up
Tom Scott also had smt along the lines of this: "I didn't learn, 'dont do it' I learnt 'keep your mouth shut'."
My friend always asks me but he's the best even though he is better than me so he got the highest mark
When I had to learn Greek meanings on some words I couldn't remember them and I got one and wrote it down on my pencil and before the test I switched my pencil out and after the test I just rubbed the pen off
This is called ✨Burnout ✨
me
Oh my god perfect timing  Okay so basically, I'm one of the dumbasses, but I seem to do good when it comes to Spanish tests, and I sit next to the smart guy in the class, I finished before him, and saw him looking over at my work, instead of scolding him, I just blocked my work like anybody *normal* would do, when we got our results back, he got a 35, and I got a 40 😂
I don't cheat for me but I do let others cheat off of my work if they want in some classes
What but in my class everybody helps each other in cheating on a test
Reason why most students cheat if because schools and parents value grades more than learning. In India, education is INTIRELY based on memorization. You gotta read the chapter, remember the main points, and learn * cough * not learn, memorise answers of half a page (sometimes the whole page). Which info will only be valuable for a 2 hours test and never uses again in life. I doubt any of my classmates will remember what we learnt (by learnt I mean memorised....). Bas ratta marna hai phir bhul Jana hai aur kya..!
bruh in 7th grade i was doing fuckin algebra and geometry
I've cheated on my Spanish test and I still managed to almost fail
I am getting 10- and up in Shutley  Edit: I mean Shurley grammar

Think smarter nor harder

Personality defect
Yea it’s the weirdest thing to see and it makes you more anxious about the test
I like how he was trying to say not to cheat then he kinda thought “ nvm I shouldn’t be saying that” then he said or if you do keep to yourself
We had a class president that cheated on a quiz on ME
I’m in 8th grade and I’m considered as a “smart kid” in class too and I have a 101 in math (but it rounds up too a 100.87) and im just like im not smart I just get my work done. 🙅‍♀️😭🤧
I only cheated in one subject. Chinese   I would write characters on my arm and sometimes I would look out the window to Chinese displays with all our characters
Same
By accident
I kinda did to
That was literally me.5th 6th and 7th grade got me slipping

I remember our head of the section aka like a head girl, got a 94 percentage and I got a Close 93. Ya wanna know why she had 94, it was cause she was cheating of notes I wrote and told her to give to my friend who was having a terrible time in exams. She didn't give them the notes and so I told our teacher, showing evidence and everything. Safe to say, I'm glad that bitch got rejected from her favorite college
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates. 🎈

Brother ik the feeling that your insanely smart in class but slowly give up the more we grow. I was there considered the smartest when i was sec 2 because i was doing work and listening and sec 4 hit i slept throughout like half of the year
I was the smartest kid in the class that cheated on the tests lol
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life7
Wow that kinda sucks because we have a teacher that is very old and doesn't see very well and we get tests from books so before the test we look at all the exercises and we write them on a piece of paper when we get the test we do it in like 10 minutes and all the class gets an A+ to easy
I’m the smartest kid in my class in fact I’m smarter than all of my classmates combined
Im the third smartest kid in class
I'm the smartest kid in my class
Yes it's me
"cheating on a test" is trending on youtube
I literally make money of stealing 1 paper of the teacher's test and giving the answers ( i am the smart girl of the class ) to everyone , 15 cents per test and we would have 2 tests every week
The first time I cheated I kinda discovered I could chest by accident. I had an agenda I'd keep under my desk and open that contained all the spelling words. It wasn't an accident any time after. I started messing with ways to make it less obvious and to make it easier for me to read at a distance. Along with glancing at it during other times so it seemed like I'd just look on that direction. Never got caught too, but I understand why in other schools they don't let you have anything under your desk.
I always cheat and don’t tell no one and I get to call everyone in the class dumb asses:)
Okay remembered cheating is good when not tell someone, but never cheat in a relationship man just remember
Lmao I was considered as a smart kid and very motivated when doing homework and tests and tried to act like an adult yk- even tho I was like 8-10 👹 but I slowly gave up and now I am now a few years older and acts like a literal 9 year old because I never got a proper childhood ig 👁👁

I was smart at grade 4 but not at grade 5 and 6
Cheated on 2nd grade spelling test
I was the smartest kid in class (my classmates all say this) and I always cheated
in my class we live by the rule "snitches get stitches" hahaha not actually, but no one snitchs on anyone else on simple things like these unless bullying, you're pretty safe to do whatever you want
You sit on the throne of lies, and when the grand teacher knows about this you will feel the same pain i have felt in that seconds of looking at you, and there i will sit and saw your betrayed face and feast upon it with feelings of glory with my two eyes

Him: Don’t Cheat Me: Laughs ‘Nervously’
I'm one of the smartest kids in my classes and I've only cheated on a test once.
The whole reason people go to school in the first place is to learn. When you cheat you don't learn anything, so what's the point in going to school.
This is me rn but I didn't cheat yet👀
I have
I remember I was in elementary school and I was working not focusing on anyone else I was in the zone. Then my teacher moved me to the front, I’m still confused if she thought I was cheating or the people around me were cheating off me. 😂
Everytime I go to  a new school my grades start to deteriorate and im expected to stay on par with my younger self.Ofc im going to have to suck it up and do questionable acts in class to stay on top.
I once got the highest grade in class. I know you won’t believe me but I didn’t cheat.
This is literally me 😂
God loves you and I do too and he sent his son  Jesus to die on the cross for our sin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Ah yes. This moment makes me remember when I didn't know the answer to my test in Chinese class (Yes, I got taught Chinese which sucks) So, me and my friends cheat using our books and the teacher didn't notice :)                                                                                                            (Sorry bad grammar)
I draw on my arms and wear an oversized hoodie or I make a paper with answers and I put tape and hide it under my desk then i drop my pencil to see the answers lol but this is only some times I’m usually the second smartest
There was one test where I didn’t know a question the teacher got called outside and one of my friends sitting behind me said what he got for it quietly and quickly and I copied it down and got it right and no one knew except me and him
"if you cheat don't keep it to yourself" nice quote
I was a dumass when i was in nursery to the 4th grade and i started improving when i was in the 5th - high school ( not gonna say because privacy) I swear everyone thought i was cheating when i got 2nd highest in science, computer and MAPEH Nobody was shocked that i got 99 on religion tho since it was kinda easy  What really made them sus of me when i got a high grade in math  In the end everyone didn't think i was cheating in class anymore because they realized that id improved but I was surprised that just because i was a dumb bitch when i was 8 made everyone think i was still dumb
Eeeh
I don’t consider it cheating, but I used to memorize the five most important things for the test, then take the 3 things below it and chant it until I got the test. Then I’d write it down on the test.
I’m not really all that smart.. in all subjects. But if we’re talking Geography, I’m probably the smartest in class. And everyone knows that I’m pretty good at Geography, asking me questions about our work in Geography, stuff like that. But on our most recent Geography test there were some questions I just couldn’t answer. But lo and behold, the study guide was right beside me, I forgot to put it away, and looked at it for answers. Still feel guilty about it two months later.
I can relate, I'm an honor student growing up but I just gave up, I'm too lazy.
Tbh I haven’t never cheated on a test
Don’t cheat but if you do don’t get caught dang that works on so many’s levels
I was considered the smartest kid in middle school when I was in 6th grade and finished 6th grade math in half the school year

Yeesssss

I remember on that one test where my mother forced me to cheat because she wanted me to do good in school
Kid let me tell you... Every smart kid cheats
Bruh, at my school, we have these social studies tests where you have to write the names of states on a map, I always cheated so easily. The night before I would draw my own version of the map and write the names down on a note card, but those big ones not the small ones, and I would just set the notecard on the ground next to my foot, whenever the teacher walked around I would put my foot on the paper
I had mandarin class and i was considered the best mandarin speaker of my grade but this one time i couldn't come to school cause family problems and i missed everything so i was panicking for he test. Heres the thing there are little open compartments to put stuff in and the only way to see it is to look at it from the front. So i secretly put mandarin book there so i knew all the words and meanings and nobody ever caught me
You are my identical twin, you are literally living my life

How do u cheat on a test? U dont know the asnwers
Omg yes
I was in sixth grade and half of my classmates cheated on the test. Most them were the popular kids. Luckily my close friends weren't one of them. What's worse is that this test was the Quarterly exam where it's a 50 item test and the contents are all the things you learned from the start of the quarter to the end of the quarter.
I love the clip of elf!! Once that played I was dying of laughter
I did the same thing grade seven but I was smarter not to tell anyone and got 92%
Ok welcome back in time in elementary school story’s  Ok so there was this guy I think named aric and he’s the smartest guy in class and the nicest and one day I saw him on math there’s like this thing around our table from winning something and there was a calculator in it and I saw aric looking away from the chromebook and turning it on and doing it THANK YOU FOR READING THIS
Bro same I’ve always been the smartest kid (all my averages were always A+) until sixth grade when my mental health started to decline and it well all went down hill I was still the smartest kid but I just didn’t study or try at anything anymore
I wish I had his memory
My friend when we were in class cheated on her math test.
We have a "code" for ABCD answers, touch your shirt for A, spin your pen for B, touch your chin for C, and rub your forehead for D, or just use the calculator method.
I remember once my friend right next to me got 20/20 in the small maths test and he was the only one who got 20/20 and i’m there with 18/20 like “I HAVE POTENTIAL TO ACHIEVE WHAT I YEARN FOR” 😂
I’m in 7th grade now but uh in like 3rd grade I cheated on a spelling test, I got caught, haven’t cheated on anything else since or before that
Ya I sat beside him and he did the exact thing I do, turn away the computer, lower the brightness, and search it up Shocked me to my core.
What if I’m just smart bug give the SPED kid answers
Definitely not to brag (because I hate it a bit) but the kids in my 4th period class in high school (mostly sophomores and a junior) worship me like the god of all science… I went to far to prove I was smart because everyone doubted me… THEY WANT ME TO EXPLAIN WHAT DARK ENERGY IS! Not even the the smartest scientist in the world could answer that. I’m happy that the semester is nearing completion and I finally get new classes.
SpongeBob popsicles
I am considered one of the smartest girls in the class.. and I've never cheated.. one day, the English teacher (he thinks he is cool bc he is probably one of the youngest teachers in the school) said: "we all have cheated once, including probably Lola (me)" and everyone started looking at me with a weird face... I was like- wtf? Lol

You are my identical twin, you are literally living my life
I'm pretty good at science this year and people tend to cheat by copying off me lol. However I do tend to cheat when it comes to technical stuff. Like equations I know I won't remember, or like today we had a test and I wrote the sizes of an atom, molecule and nucleus down. All on my hand. And then I use hand sanitiser to clean it all off once I'm done with them. Sometimes I use the back of my calculator for the equations too. Works everytime.
Yes this happens alot when am the third on class
i was 1 of the smartest kids and i cheated for no reason.
Same with me bro I was THE smartest and then somehow 7th grade rolls around and now I’m dumber than somebody using a 1911 in modern warfare
69th comment
At least I’m the 69th comment
Bro I did the same on a spelling test even though it was one of the easiest in the whole year
I'm in the top on the klass
that’s literally me lol
Grade school in grade 8 u can get a 0 in everything and go to highschool
My brain is too small for cheating
One time the smart kid was sitting behind me and lo and behold, he had a cheat sheet. A week after, we get the results and he get a big F. I just laughed at him because I got a B+
Dam this was me I was the smartest kid in grade 6 but that quickly turned around because in grade 8 I was the dumbest
I mean... its not cheating if its a cheat sheet am i right??? Heheheheh
ay bro you should adjust them pants.. 😳
Same
You put it in your pin… so fuckin smart! BRO thx  hhehehehe
dude today we were doing this play thing right before our irish test and i found a note on the floor from the smartest girl in our class cus she always gets 100% and i said i found a cheat sheet on the floor as a joke and the smart girl said “That’s mine and it’s not a cheat sheet it’s a practice test” and i looked at my bestfriend and she started laughing cus then she hid the note in her pencil case and during the test she kept looking at something so i knew she was cheating but i didn’t snitch cus that’s just bad out
I am a smart kid at school but ı actually didn't work like crazy so ı cheated some of my test.
How did you think he became the smartest person in the class?
Rap snitches tellin all their business sit in the court and be their own star witness
The way I cheat I just say I'm cramped and wanna stand up and when you stand up you can look the other classmates awnser
The pen trick you said is actually pretty smart so thanks for the idea
Hi
I’m the smartest
Okay remembered cheating is good when not tell someone, but never cheat in a relationship man just remember
I was smart.....then I was stupid
This happen to me before so  the smart kid in my class we were in a spelling bee and  when Im done with the test I realized that the smart kid was cheating and looking at all of the questions in his book and my teacher wasn't looking  Don't worry I did not cheat I already had my test mark I did. Not say anything because I  was  a quiet kid while all of the class was cheating and screaming   but I did not was to snitch
But wut if ur teachers watching this? Can u still get in trouble?? Btw I made the same mistake last month and this suck up told the teacher 😒
I once was the only one to get a hundred but nobody knew the teacher went and said only one person got a 100% but didn’t said who everybody was looking around to see who it was
Like I know math, like most maths. I know English, I know German, I know that like chemistry s**t, but you gotta let me love, I SUCK at Spanish and French. Let me live for gods sake :,)
The reason most of the smart kids (I'm considered one so I'd know) cheat is because of the unthinkable amount of pressure they're put under 24/7
Same yo even I was really good at school in smaller classes and now it's just no (IDK why) 😂
So there was a test on laptop and someone 'hid' a full A4 sheet of paper under their tiny laptop. Nobody said a thing..
Wait,why is his story and mine so similiar,I mean I'm considered smart in class, and I cheated for da first time  in 7th..suss
Today I was doing a spellings test 2 ppl were cheating one tried to copy her book and one copied a slcheat sheet
Is it just me or is the you sit on a throne of lies got me Dying of laughter
Same I was the same
I- Uh-- once cheated in class on 4th grade because I arrived early and saw the answer for the test then wrote it in a piece of paper then stuck it inside of my pen then put on it's cover so only I can see it since it's dark so if they wanted to see anything they had to look a lot closer and mind you I was one of the smarter students in class-  And also the time in 4th grade where our teacher that time was a soldier she was too fast when speaking and writes as fast as she speaks so we were unprepared but since our teacher wanted us to pass we closed all the curtains and erased our wrong answers and replaced it with the right answer as our teacher tells the answer and after that we all passed. Nobody ever spoke a thing until we were 6th grade
If I didn't cheat on my math test I wouldn't be going to grade 10 next year. For real, I wrote all the things I had to know on paper, hid it behind my exam pad and when the exam was given I removed the staple and put the cheat sheet behind it and when I looked at the answers it looked like I was looking at the exam.
Literally every single time
I was once one of the smartest kid in the class and the same happened to me- I slowly become dumb 😐
Today was my ptm
