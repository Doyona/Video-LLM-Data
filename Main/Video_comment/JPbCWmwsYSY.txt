Yes I will be doing a walkthrough.
Someone already spoiled Miquella; my fault for reading
Dreams come true; busy summer for us as it turns out
Cowboy are you a military vet?
21:52 is that a new spell or weapon of some sort?
Don't wanna sound like a smartass, but it's much easier to use arrows <- / -> to skip 5 seconds and SPACE to pause, to carefully go through bits. Just Saying.
LETSS GGGGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
On One of Marika’s catacombs, there’s an inscription about Mesmer.
New Twinblades😁
Looks like Godrick the Grafted with a Lion Head attached to his arm instead of a Dragon Head
I love dark souls series and elden ring. True piece of art by the way: does "Elden Ring" mean "Ring of fire"? Swedish / Scandinavian root I believe
25:39 looks like shadow tree overlapping erdtree
Dude i love your videos you helped me out theoufh my second play through
Miquella and Malenia incest😭😭
Maybe it's her father.
Anyone know how to back up a save on steam deck device for Elden ring?
I’m following your walkthrough atm thank you for such great work
So I’m just finishing my first play through.  Do I complete the game? Or wait.  If I complete it do I go into new game?  Can I use my existing character or do I need to make another?   I’m so confused.
Have a feeling there is gonna be a another Scarlet Rot area that sucks u dry while in a battle
Shattered space   Prob around Jun?
finally a face to a voice!  thanks for all you do!
It’s been a while Tarnished
Can't Wait To Get My Hands On It 💯💯💯👐
Its looks awesome I just pre ordered it and waiting!! @FightinCowboy my go to for the walkthroughs. Awesome job man!!
Buenos días sr
I started the og walk-through again just to prep myself 😂
26:48 anybody know what set hes using in the "thunder thrusts" character?
Can’t wait to do the play with series and walkthrough with you again man.  Elden Ring is my first time playing a souls style game and your videos made this so much less painful than it would have been for a complete nub experiencing From Software for the first time.
You make me buy and loved the game with your walk-through..so much I preciated!❤
Who’s ready for the nightmares and rage quits 😂😂😂
The movie is partially good
Need yr walkthrough to complete the nx journey
I’m currently using your walk throughs for a ng+ to get all the shit I missed ❤
Will you be doing a walkthrough in future
Rykard and malenias son or malenia and mogywn  or mogywn and miquella
Verynice
Awesome I didn't even know there was a DLC coming out and I just started a second play through. Fallowing the walkthrough this time. I finished Liurnia Walkthrough first play through and went off on my own. Missed a ton of stuff in the capital as it exploded. ha. getting it right this time.
That’s 100% Miquella, melenias Twin☠️
I like how they are doing power level different and its more like Sekiro. So all those level 300s will still struggle in the beginning.
Favourite thing is we are finally getting aspect of the crucible wings
Walkthrough? Is it suppose to be that much content? Nb love your ER walkthrough and lets play
She def had another kid she left in this realm . The twins may be triplets. The big guy is the wicker man. He has a giants head strapped to his belt.
1,31 Mill subs and you are still working a part time job?
Do you need to defeat the Lord of blood Mogh to play this dlc?
So my running theory about Messmer: You can have multiple versions of people at the same time, like seeing Dung Eater as an invader in Roundtable and his corporeal body underneath Leyndell, right? Miquella is torn between what he originally wanted to be and what Mohg was trying to make him. Messmer is the version Mohg was trying to create by keeping Miquella imprisoned and feeding him blood. Snakes are a symbol of blasphemy within the Elden Ring lore, and the blasphemous rites to turn Miquella from the Golden Order had spawned the Messmer version. So Miquella's ideal version of himself pre-corruption is your new maiden leading you onward to fight the corrupted version of himself to restore Order somehow.  I dunno, probably wrong, but it'd be a neat little twist and support the duality of choice that Elden Ring has fostered thus far.
Thanks!
Nnice
Man I could feel that hype when you saw the trailer and I'm so on board
Another old gamer here, 61 and just retired from the VA. Plenty of time to enjoy this now. I have 6 Saturdays and a Sunday every week!
Remember the wait for Elden ring and now it’s been two years since release, June will be here so quick
Good work being able to go full-time on your channel. Love your work.
I think I fractured my fingers pre ordering this DLC
Maricka is the mother hes referring to, imo.
You work at VA. Are u a veteran as well. I am.
Hey ive watched u for a long time now. You helped me in the past beat all souls games many times. And nioh 2 lies of p lords of the fallen. But i never played nioh the original, and one of your videos helped a lot cause it was way different than nioh2. So  i wanted to say thank you..
VaatiVidya already has an amazing video up for the lore and potential story of the DLC. Explains where we will be going and how it works in the timeline. Essentially it's a mirror world happening at the same time as the events of our game. So finally a present time DLC.
I can’t wait for this to come out! I’ll be sure to check your walkthrough for help! You rock!
When it comes to the red headed bastard child....you player 1 are not the father !
Bone fist, bone fist, bone fist!
Hell yes lets goo😃
Did you realise the dual swords stance was different, one sword held backwards
Yesssss
Finally a face behind the GOAT
why does ever yter look so much different than I would have imagined.
Just started my 1st playthrough in time for DLC god I haven't ever been so obsessed with a game b4!!
All I want is another friend to talk elden ring with 😢😢😢😢 this looks amazing 🤩
The DLC lives dope as f***
So now I got the neck game downloaded again. So I'm going to have to play it none until the d. L. C.
I thought you were getting ready to play the DLC so I hurried up and bought it now. I regret it
I can't wait 😢
I just finished lords of the fallen should I play elden ring ?
Looks awesome can’t wait to play
Bro your my favorite streamer
12:40
I think the biggest question lore wise considering the giant brazier / wicker thing is the simplest:  How'd it get burned?
any idea what level and area would be good place to stop at, so i can jump right in the dlc
Excited
Can't waiiiiit llllleeeeeetttss gooooooooo!!!
This feels like a prequel to stop all we just did …save the Erdtree for real.
The fact that people who get to play before release but don’t even record the walkthrough is stupid bro you could literally get monetised on YouTube just for the walkthrough
The may we meet woman talking has to be the boss fight to rival the blade of hoochie 🙄 the Mesmer is to obvious of a guess. That has to be a hint
The lion might be Godwyn or Serosh's form before it became a spirit to satisfy Godfrey? Messmer might be Miquella's new form because he journeys in his own dream to find out why Queen marika was there in the first place, I feel like Miquella became Messmer because he found out how his own mother became a god, Marika did things in the Lands of Shadows that interested the pure hearted Miquella so he shed his body in the Lands Between to find out about his mother's birthright and he might have succeeded which is why he must be the hardest boss in the DLC or maybe Messmer is actually the real Rykard, the snakes around Messmer symbolizes the Volcano Manor quite well but Messmer being Rykard seems kinda odd, I do hope we face a second Rykard that is harder I mean Lady Tanith did try to eat Ryakrd in the main game which could symbolize a DLC boss for sure, if you kill Tanith in Rykard boss room then maybe you can't fight Rykard in DLC, quite a possible scenerio.
Cowboy predicted everything before the traveler starts, gahtdamn.
Good
You're the man cowboy. Just finished the platinum walk through for eldn ring.
Remember when cowboy found the hidden dragon Plauxidusexs great moment hope he finds something in the dlc
This was epic and the June release was unexpected for me,cannot wait 😁
@fightincowboy When do you get to start walkthrough prep on this?
I presume you too are keen to know what kind Miquella is doing here
Why is everyone at 150? Do I need to stop there for the dlc to be viable?
What if Mesmer is just the name for Miquella fully realized through the bloodflame of Mohg’s ritual?? Between Mohg, Miquella and the formless mother (the outer god of bloodflame)
I think the martial arts character is a mini boss fighting us and we won't be able to use it but I hope we can
they all kinda feel like 3 stage bosses tbh.... rip
I just realized the Fire Giant Burning-Man thing is full of screaming bodies reaching out from it. Arms, torso, legs...  The Lion-head boss reminds me of traditional Chinese Lion Dance troupes, a hand was manipulating the mouth of the mask at the start. Chinese Lion Dancers are typically 2 or more people with a mask/body cover... that's sick.
If you listen to gowry enough, he all but says straight out that milliscent and her sisters are born of malenia.  And about messmer, there are a few references to marika/radagon’s unwanted child. Like he was cast away for whatever reason we’ll be finding out in dlc I’m sure.
Mother is the god of blood, it’s gotta be
if he had not talked over voice acting he would have heard messmar say mother so its prob the son not the twin of her
I'll definitely watch your walkthrough again!
Red hair is Radagon thing. Most of his children have red hair. Radahn, Rykard, Ranni (if you look at her real corpse, there are remnants for redhair), Malenia, Melina (it is heavily implied that Marika is Melina's mother.). Only Miquella has golden hair.
It kinda sounds like Malenia doing the speech at the end "Come now. Touch the withered arm, and travel to the realm of shadow. I will not be far behind. May we meet again."
😮 can’t wait 👏👏👏
It look more to me like one tree is strangling the other?
Yo da man🤙✊
Is this dlc content or a second game?
I've only played ds1 on my switch, but my little brother is sending me his ps4 so I can do all the others. can't wait.
Been following your walkthrough for my second playthrough and man the amount of time you put into these is insane. Thanks so much. But this trailer reveal I can now put a face to the voice.
Almost time!!
I'm excited, are u excited? Because I am! 😄
I got lucky n saw this at the most perfect time! ❤
This guy is blessed with the best male voice in history
Yo Cowboy! Just curious what your thoughts would be regarding the DLC.. do you think it would be better to start a new play through or use my main game save (end of 7th play through)? Just not sure how OP my character would be vs a fresh start. How would you plan on doing it?
Can’t wait too see your walk thru
Only way I'd do an Elden Ring DLC is if they give us dragon mounts, flying would be optimal, and/or dragon summons, maybe through a healing Greyoll questline. I dunno... Elden was way too long for me. A DLC would have to be beyond worth it.
U know this is my first time to see wat is going on guys face ❤️
They're both Miquella. The blond is St Trina, and the redhead is his male form, just like marika and radagon
I think the lion thing is a fusion of the old crones.  We offended the two fingers and now they went voltron mode to kill us.
Sounds like Varre,  "mother..." part. He called lord of blood father, right?so maybe his wife?
Melenia twin?
It's not Miquella at the end. That's Fia the death bed companion.  Miquella is son of Queen Marika and Radagon. He had a sister who we slayed, Melania.  So my thoughts are, Miquella had something brewing inside the egg (alternate reality or something maybe) the all knowing was fearful of him remaining alive (I tried to go kill him and was unsuccessful). Although Gideon doesn't know what may come from him being left alive in the egg, there are more pressing issues to attend to, the burning of the tree and the chance to become Elden Lord. Gideon does mention that he is some what taken back from the lack of knowledge on what to do about not only the thorns of the tree but Miquella being in the egg...   Could both be linked? The thorns and Miquella? Probably not, however what if.
I feel like this is Rykard’s son bc of the snakes
Do i need to have a high character from the main game to play it? Or does it start at lvl 1?
You’re a fucking part time developer for the VA and a full-time YT legend. What a unicorn role man.
Let’s do this!!!!
The flagship boss is never the final boss of the dlc.  The real final boss or hidden boss will probably come out of left field.
The Impaler is Miquella under the new worship of the formless mother!
He talks to the formless mother like Lord of Blood, I think this guy is like holding Miquella in the formless mothers world or he is Miquella who got taken by Mohg and now worships formless mother?
Wonder if the guy with the snakes has something to do with those big red gladiator guys who have the snake grab?
Looks like Lightning of tomoe from Sekiro the Lion is doing! That could be like Gofreys master or something? All of this looks so SICK, these guys are the best in the word at making video games second to none! They keep setting the bar higher and higher! Armored Core, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro, Elden Ring! All masterpieces through and through and this looks nothing less then the best! Fromsoft is incredible! Keep it up guys. I'm sure this DLC will have stuff other games try to copy for years to come like everything else Fromsoft does.
All radagon and mericas children have names that start with M. Im guessing thats messmer is one of their children. Maybe the oldest that was passed up for godhood
Wow, the collector's ed. will cost 270 CHF in Switzerland. that's roughly ~306 US$ !!!! Hell nah!  As much as I'd love the collector's ed. , that price... HELL NAH!
I wonder is Messmer is related to Miquella and Millicent. Because he looks identical, But all of this takes place After the battle with Mohg. Kinda like a side quest map. I wonder if start a new game from the beginning if the map opens up after you defeat Mogh. So what I assume is the story runs alongside the original story.. Because Hoarah Loux hadn't taken the Beast Regent Serosh yet and become Godfey the First Elden Lord. I wonder if that lion in the trailer is Serosh.
🤠 🐐
I cried is that weird lol! I just find Elden ring so therapeutic discovering all the hidden paths and treats as well as the lore its so peaceful and majestic i cant wait till june!
I cant wait for your blind and 100% walkthrough cowboy!
At 13:41 does that picture remind anyone else of sister Friede and her father? This is giving Me some crazy goosebumps. Really wondering now if this is all connected to the Dark Souls universe. I’m beyond hyped! The setting looks like the original great tree, before the Erdtree came to be from the greater will.
We won't need sun lotion for the DLC because it is in the shadow
Arent those the same eyes as runebears?
666666
That tree looks like something when the tree is chop in half and grow back again.
Can’t wait for anther journey with you 🤩🤩
I think miquella is going to be the enemy. He's too squeaky clean and he has the ability to control minds? Sound pretty suss
It looks like behind the erdtree the very fabric of reality is shifting, I feel that's the symbology behind that, wonder will there be more a focus of celtic mythology in the dlc, obvious irish character in it, maybe the enemy faction will be miyazaki version of the tuath de Danann, the pantheon of irish gods, definitely can see a sequel in the works someday, cause there's no way there putting all the godwyn stuff, all the gloam eyed queen stuff and the outer gods into one expansion.
I don’t understand ! Can u help me with one question guys . I have a character that a finish the game with the help of walkthrough of the cowboy , the char is NG+1 , we need a new character or I can go with this one ? 😢
"Yo! Martial arts! Big pots! Rapid fire arbalest!!!" You know this is gonna be a good dlc
It's going to be great when you enter the Land of Shadow only to find that the game rips you of all your possessions and sends you back to lvl 1...because, Elden Ring.
Not done these sort things in games before. Will you have to have a played through elden ring to play this? I finished it when came out but don't have it anymore etc.
Might be a silly question but if I have the disc version of Elden ring do my weapons etc carry over to the dlc if I pre order it digitally? Hope that makes sense..
He looks similar to the Drake armor set
Seeing cowboy genuinely has difficulty to hide his smile knowing this DLC become reality soon, is priceless & contagious! ❤ 💪🏽
Can’t wait! Keep the walkthrough build the same as the main game walkthrough please!
hi cowboy , greetings from a big fan from Egypt . I'm 42 old you made the game fantastic . thanks for every video  . waiting for a full walkthrough 🔥
I always wanted the DLC to be multiple versions of the map based on the ending you choose. So if you choose the the age of stars you have to deal with the world after that was chosen and so you get different bosses and the landscape changes/unlock different regions etc. And then frenzied flame options would be a different outcome and so forth. I dont think this would actually happen but its a cool idea.
You are the legend Cowboy!!
I Dreamt for some long… I was so bored and Lord of the fallen sucked… Games after games left in my wake as I waited Elden Rings return…
Dear Sir, now the jewelry box is located..... We are counting on you. ❤❤❤❤❤
Fighting cowboy  your cute with all bue respect
My body and soul are ready…
coincidence that they're releasing it on "621" 🤔
The tree could be what happened after Mikayla shattered the ring and destroyed the life cycle
Dude WTH I can’t wait to get killed over and over
That lion with blight looks like its inspired from Lion, dragon dancers from Asia
https://youtu.be/ncawnKPqhH8?si=QcImHbc98po_JkYR  I know you’re not well at figuring out the lore same as me. This is the only person I really watch for that then for you on gameplay. It’s break down some more possibilities of things for you n people. Although I assume you have people to tell you stuff Cowboy.   There’s an interesting theory for the boss in this having to do with the butterflies in the game. One for each of 3 children of Makila and Radagons children. The boss would be the third instead of Malenia like many thought.  Also interesting note the kung fu stuff we see looks exactly like the leaping kicks you can do in Sekiro. I knew it looked familiar then confirmed when I started up Sekiro and saw others talking about it  I love Elden Ring and how it brings almost everything together from the rest of their games.
I could’ve watch y’all talking about this for a hour. This is great news. It’s the DLC I wanted and I’m hoping, but kinda doubting, they do another one that’s a prequel of before the tree. Giants and dragons or some mix like that. I wanted to know exactly what happened before in some type of way. This would tie in not before and after. As far as after I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a few things to do before you go to the egg. It’s showed the world burning as well idk just guessing and hoping 😅
SotE looks darker and more gothic looking than the base game.  Can’t wait till June!
Look amazing - but with so many players now at max levels, best weapons, fought major bosses on multiple difficulty levels - how hard will this/ can this be for them?
Can you approximate the size of the world compared to the world in the base game? Miyazaki: It's hard to answer without giving away too much and to a high degree of accuracy, but if you think in terms of scale or size, it's probably comparable, if not larger, than the area of Limgrave from the base game.
We are going to enter his head
17:53 looks like yet another poison swamp, hrmmm deathblight  maybe?
14:32 "straight hands build".
Got a job for you, 6/21.
The lion face thing looks like an ulcerated tree spirit before it was ulcerated, maybe?
Imagine if it's a different withered arm.
Guess I will have to go back and start playing Elden Ring again to warm up for the DLC.
What if Malenia is incest shotacon for Michella and borne Mesmer. Huh triple M? Ok I'll stop with the blasphemy
Rosethorn sorcery, the blood star....I feel like that's mesmas powers
Wow just amazing
So stoked for this… can’t control my excitement this year. Dragons dogma, elden ring shadow of erdtree and Wukong black myth 😅
no miquella or godwynn is sort of a let down ngl :////
I think it's the child of trader rycard.
What if Miquella was your guide in the Shadow similar to Melina?
We had LetMeSoloHer... prepare for LetMeSoloHim...
yo, give me some claws with the flippy kick ash of war and let me go to town
The ladybug was also here for the trailer drop 😂
Fromsoft, June cmon im depressed in the winter, I need it now
14:13 So Messmer is monologuing to someone he calls "mother", the Formless Mother perhaps? It looks like his moveset and weapons are all based on bloodflame. Damn he's going to be tough, I just know it!
I’m so hyped for the lion boss fight he’s so scary and I love it. At first I thought it was maliketh. I also hope we get to wear messmars gear cause it looks badass
Cool is this a continuation of the game? Hadn't heard this
From Software are on a new level of gaming. Are they going to dump more DLC moving forward.  Will this become like Elder Scrolls and just get more chapters every so many years.
Why nobody has mentioned that the lion/dog thing  kinda looks like vicar Amelia????
Didn’t Mohg follow the mother of blood?
I watched this thing like 20 times today.
DUDE WE GET CRUCIBLE KNIGHT WINGS FINALLY!!!!!!!!
couldn’t wait to see your reaction after the shadow drop !
When he says “mother do you truly find one so blah blah fit of lordship.  I think he’s talking to Marika, the one you place the rune in to claim lordship and settle your ending
If we're in a dream, as the gossamer over the Erdtree suggests (like a bed bower) then time might flow and be porous. Time might only act like this above that walled city or it may effect the whole realm.  If so, we may be able to interact with past, present and future.
Watch this dlc be like 50 hours long lol
The snakes, speaking to a mother that is still alive, my theory is Messmer is the son of Rykard and Tanith.
So Stoked, my current theory on  Messmer is that he's going to end up being the "2nd half" of another main character, similar to the Marika vs. Radagon relationship.
If i beat the game but did not start ng+ will i still be able to start the DLC?
just a thought... the tree in the Main game was an illusion so this might be right before the game while the original erdtree was still there? before totally being destroyed? i dunno
This seems massive in scope, cant wait! I thought the Erdtee at the beginning is actually the Crucible.
This the fun job player.. there's a difference.  Run it!
It is possible that the three distinct knights are representation of covenants? Or they just represent different areas?
🤔Looks and remind me of the more “animal” version of Lion -> GODFREY, snake -> RYKARD in this DLC 😬
the red eye in the egg, could be Messmer the Impaler in the egg!
Think there will be new stats?
If you remember radagon and marika had 3 children but we only saw miquella and mlenia who had butterfly of they're own. And if you remember fire butterfly never had someone etched to it. So I think this new guy is that son of marika that relates to fire butterfly.
Isn't the redheaded dude Miquella himself?
I'm always skeptical of games coming out until we have them in our hands... for this one I'm actually fckn sooooooo hyped
Finally!! Thank you from software, this DLC looks so sick!👍🥃
Remember in the law snakes are dispised and reviled. Maybe this is why
Cant wqit to follow another walkthrough
😂 clearly not a destiny player
I think Messmer is grown version of Miquella with red hair like Melania
I got a feeling he's the Son of the Gloam Eyed Queen since he uses Black Flame so I got a feeling God Slayers are the new BBEG's
He’s my opinion. This is in the future and the player character and Rani have a kid, and he’s turned all Kylo Ren on us
Do we even know if the gold haired person is Miquella? I feel like it can be Marika. And Messmer has those long lanky hands, reminiscent of Miquellas hand.
Thank to your guidance I completed the game 4 times. 2 times under my account and 2 times under my wife's account. Can't wait to see your walk through of this as well. Thank you very much.
Can't wait!!!!
Also the arm length and hand on messemer resembles miquella in the egg a lot, could be mohg corrupted miquella
I think it's Miquela corrupted by Mohg. And his mother is definitely Marika. Because he talks about her" kingdom bereft of light" which I think is what Marika did when she broke the Elden Ring and lost faith in the Greater Will. As for the name,I believe he took a new name upon himself,Mesmer, (Which I believe has to do with the fact that Miquela had the ability to "mesmerize" others)and also the devs didn't want to outright spoil the surprise that he is Miquela.
Anybody notice the girl in the portrait has fias hood?
Anybody notice the girl in the portrait has fias hood?
They'll add the final crucible spell, the winged charge and thats awesome
I cant wait to explore, new weapons, gear and spells
I think Mesmer is the lady Maria of this game. A main story boss, but not the FINAL boss, and also not the secret optional super boss. The malenia 2.0 I think will be a boss not shown in trailers.
June 24 release date ?
cowboy looks exited
I want to say Marika, since she made us Elden Lord in all endings
Didn't we already decide that was the Helphen Tree? I hope it isn't time travel, I want a pseudo sequel like ringed city, or a true sequel
The difference in the tree and forsaken place could be the land of the snakes outside the in-between
Yes!! Dragons Dogma 2 will hold me until Shadow! I’m so stoked!!
Mesmer will be related to the snake gods, just like Rykard
Rennallas egg
Is there a release day yet?
that lion head looks like its been grafted from godries lion onto godrick
‘Pre shit went down’. Now there’s a thought, a dream sequence of how we came to get here, sort of expanding on the opening of the original game start. And we get to play it!
I'll be cheesing my way through this too but it looks amazing.
Im still on my first play through...at what point do we think I should stop? As in I don't want to complete the game and have to start from scratch to access the DLC. I've pretty much just got to Haligtree so guessing I've not got much left :/
Ranni’s shadow: Blaidd/ Baleful Shadow Marika’s Shadow: Maliketh Godfrey’s Shadow: Serosh The Erdtree’s Shadow: ????
I'm still doing lords of the fallen can't wait for this either
Cowboy: could it be the son of Malenia and Miquella? Me: Well the story is written by George RR Martin
As quite a few people have mentioned the Demi-god children's initial letter follows the same as the Maternal parent (Godfrey and Godrick being the exceptions) so the theory that Messner is some forgotten child of Marika seems like a red herring.   From what we have seen of Messner is that he looks to be using Bloodflame but at a higher proficiency than Mohg, so we know there is an Outer-God known as The Formless Mother/Mother of Truth, who Bloodflame comes from so I reckon Messner has some more to do with her rather than Marika as the "Mother" he mentions, if that was even Messner we heard speaking and not potentially Miquella instead. Or because this is a Shadow version of the Lands Between, Messner could be a bastardised version of Miquella caused by whatever Mohg was doing with him and the Formless Mother's influence to bring Miquella to "Godhood" as that was what Mohg's goal was so he could be the King's consort.
Ranni is definitely the one who tells us about the egg
messer= rykard+miquella
That flaming thing is the son of Sun Bro and Fire Gigant. Or perhaps the DS1 grave guy with masks might have been involved in some wierd threesome.
I think Miquella pulled a Marika and split himself in two to remove mohgs/formless mothers corruption
I would have never beaten this game without Cowboy! This game is amazing! Can’t wait for this DLC.
23:41 I'm getting bad flashbacks of  Laurence, the First Vicar
So you travel to a realm of shadows I wonder if you leave all your gear behind :o
I just preordered everything
I'm betting that's a fusion of Mogh and Miquella.
Final boss is 100% Miquella. Mother = Marika
Few people had red hair like that, and all were connected from Radagon.
We finally get to meet miquella I can’t wait and it’s dropping 6 days before my birthday 💪🏾💪🏾🔥🔥
I think he talke about the nameless mother since is about the blood 🩸 lord mogh
the dawg cowboy!
So if u look at the release date its the players callsign in armored core 5 621
Gonna be the best dlc ever in any game
Yes! Perfect breakdown of how we get into the DLC! It must be the egg in Mohg’s boss room. I’m very sure that the person at the end is Miquella.   I also think by the look of the tree that Miquella sees that the tree may somehow be restored due to some weird dream/sleep realm type thing? I don’t know, but I do know that this Shadow of the Erdtree DLC will be a mind f*ck. I’m also expecting Malenia to be “revived” in the DLC. That would be such a FromSoftware thing to do. Oh, where’s VaatiVidya when you need him?!
Why do I have the idea they're gonna make another dlc near the death bed Lady
Messmar is Miquella. Its so fucking obvious. Its the same arm.
Man and after 400+ hrs I thought I'd be done with this game. I thought so wrong lol
Turn on CC to see exactly what was said in the trailer. June can't come soon enough.😎
i'm like 99% sure Messmer is Malenia's son somehow. Think about how people name their children in Elden Ring, the first letters are always linked to the parents. Marika and Godfrey have Mohg, Morgott and Godwyn. Marika and Radagon have Malenia, Miquella and Melina. Radagon and Renalla have Ranni, Rykard and Radahn. Rykard has a daughter called Rya, Malenia already has a daughter called Millicent. I guess "mother" could be Melina somehow too, but purely based on the hair I'm putting my money on Malenia.
We shall meet Melenia again in Shadow of the Erdtree because she is not far behind
I started elden ring less than 10 days ago and NOW THIS DROPS XD I gotta finish the main story and then do this DLC
Somebody has got make ELDEN RING into a live action movie, right?...
Cant wait to ditch my friends for the 100% walk through again
Imagine if an Elden Ring DLC were to win Game of the Year
"Mother wouldst thou truly lordship sanction, in one so bereft of light" based off this I think mother could be Melina
Cowboy would definitely skip those other games for an Elden Ring Expansion!
I don't like this date at all.. it could potentially overlap with Dawntrails' release.
So exciting!!! More fabulous content for what is probably the best game ever made!
looks like instead of dragon incantations you get lion incantations
Bro if you don’t mind me asking, what is your day job? I thought this was your day job since you put so much time into it. I got even more respect for you now knowing you got a whole ass different job and you still put in the time and energy for this channel
See the guy walking up the lava area on the pipe has like yuffies weapon
What if milenia and mequilla weren't the only children????
Fromsoftware is the only gaming company I trust. The boss fight, man this whole dlc and trailer is EPIC. This DLC will prob contain more content then full games lol. Looking forward to this but yeah this Messmer guy is prob Rykard offspring, or idk something badass. But THAT SEKIRO MONK KICKS!
I want to see how they will relate the shadow realm and the godwyn influence
Absolutely epic
“Mother wouldst thou truly lordship sanction in one so bereft of light”  “I think that has something to do with us just being a regular dude”  What an eloquent way to diss us lmao
27:40 FC can ur knowledge help me out? Whats the BEST seal to use when doing Dragon breath and which points go into making those breaths stronger? Anyone know?
The virgin fromsoftware: 30 dolares por un pto dlc  The chad Santa Monica: Aca tenes un dlc gratis pibe
It's Hoarah Loux's head on Margit's body.
25:27 "may we meet AGAIN"
He could be young Rykard ...
GOTY 2024!!!
I literally just did a playthrough a couple weeks ago, but fuck it imma do it again 😤 I love this game, no other game is the same after playing ER for so long
Helllll yeah! Another walkthrough from Cowboy!!!
Sounds like Nepheli's voice telling us to touch the withered arm.
This video is ranked #36 for video games. Good job FC
PS: This game is going to be SICK!!!!!!!!!
Hey cowboy, you act like a kid with a new toy on christmas.😂😂😂Love you man and all the videos you share on YouTube. Thank you sir!
You legit saved me on my 1st playthrough thanks so much bro.
BTW Trailer reaction starts at 12:36
Game trailer starts at 12:40
Just ignoring the WINGS in the last shot?
Welp there goes my summer
Malenia and Miquella definitely had a child. Just as twisted as marika and radagon.
So basically we are going to the in-between "shadow realm". I wouldn't be surprised if it's the same place as the night version of the roundtable that we got to see in main game.
These are such amazing games, I wished they would dumb them down and make difficulty levels for those of us that suck at these kinds of games. I will watch the walkthrough, but won't buy or play because of the level of difficulty.
Nah messmer will be the 1st boss you fight in that realm. He got too much screen time 😂.
So your telling me I hsve to finish my platinum of sekiro znd mzybe do a replay of Elden ring .
George rr Martin did help write it.. so its a safe bet the story is incest based.
Did he say mother In the trailer? Is it malenias son?
June 2024. Let’s play Shadow of the erdtree. Episode 126. “Another area?! Are you kidding me?!” ❤❤
lets faking go
Also, the walking fire dude is definitely a call on the Wicker Man, but more than likely is referencing the Wicker Man that shows up in Berserk
I hope it will be as much content as a stand-alone DS game
Absolutely love your content! Just to mention if not already know Eurogamer got a chance to sit down with for an exclusive DLC interview with Hidetaka Miyazaki!
Checking in bro, appreciate the content
Mesmer could be Miquella's shadow, in the psychological sense of the term. Mesmer because it's the dark side of Miquella's enchantments as St Trina. Not black flame, but bloodflame.   We are in a dream after all. There look to be 'veils' draped down from the Erdtree's branches over the world.
Going to start a new play through as well, I beat it on PS5 back in 2022, this time I’ll do it in pc. I haven’t played it since June 2022 so it will be pretty fresh again for me 😅
Dollars to doughnuts those red flames are going to be new Bloodflame incantations
I feel like it is miquella memories of the past.  Before everything  went to poop
Hot take: because George RR Martin is involved, there has to be some incest. Messmer is the son of Miquella and Melania.
I think that because we burnt the Eard tree. This is the consequences of that on the land. And of course, it will be some time later. Maybe 10 or 20 years. But who knows all I know is I can't wait
Let’s fucking go!
A collectors edition.......for a DLC.
Bro I am amped up for this game !
snek boi = Rykard Respawned?
Back to the conversation. Could it be Rykards and lady Taniths son?
There was Havel’s Armor Set!
Could be miquella rebirth as messmer through the formless  mother/outer god of blood using his body from the egg to give birth to a new god/demi god. Theirs also the snakes atop his helmet/crown which could tie in Rykard?
Mesmer the impaler has the same hand from the egg in the beginning of the trailer 🧐
Im all the way locked in for the month of June - July🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Let’s gooooooooooooooo !!!!!
From soft already said its a whoe new area and map. Its bigger then the whole limgrave area
13:31 Havel 13:40 deathblight swamp. Miazaki couldn't help himself.
Who else is quitting their job and dumping their gf when this comes off!?
I love your walk throughs . Cowboy
Hopefully other Developers watch this as well This is what AAA LOOKS LIKE
When I saw the high monk I legit started screaming. Btw, if Messmer is the one talking about Lordship, that would likely make him Marika&Radagon's son. Don't even want to think about how that would actually work though 😝  And one last thought: it looks like they're ignoring Godwyn completely, hopefully that means there will be a second DLC at some point.
YOOOO im replaying the game with a dex int build so i can have a NG ready for the dlc.
This seems like an Inverted or a shadow version of the Lands Between. Like maybe you take Miquella's hand and you get pulled into a lands between with an Erdtree that doesnt glow, but shadows the lands. Like an opposite of the Golden Order
June 2024 I got nothing but time
Maybe that Messner is an offspring of Rykard when he was human and Melenia. I’m basing this on the red hair Melenia had and the serpent that surrounds him the same as Rykard.
This dropping in June is bs . It better be 30+ hrs worth of gameplay man
What time is the DLC coming out?
Hope we get new NPCs with their own quests
Release date 24.6.21  621. Very cute, FromSoft!
hello cowboy
I’m so excited for this. If Miquella ends up being the final boss of this DLC, I will die of happiness. Even more so if Godwyn appears
Messmer is most likely Saint Trina’s son, an alter ego of Miquella. She is the Goddess of sleep and dreams, so we could be fighting for saint Trina in Miquella’s dream state since he is sleeping in the egg. It is also said that Miquella was awaiting his chosen meaning the player character most likely. The amount of knightly and heavy looking armors added give Ds2 fashion souls vibes, so I’m definitely skipping my classes to get them all.
Let's goo
What's the best place to get collecters edition?
I’ve been waiting on this ever since i saw your reaction to it i wonder if theyre gonna put new magic spells or a new type of magic be interesting to see
Maybe Miquella is split in 2 like Marika and Radagon 🤷🏾‍♂️
Miyazaki said the DLC map is a little bigger than the Limgrave region
Wonder if you can download just the dlc
If this is a dream, Messmer could be how Miquela is envisioning himself since he wasn't able to grow up and he just took on a different name.
Yesss! I played for the first time in over 6 months & forgot how to 2-hand. I just finished another playthrough of BB so I f**King up all over the place! Can't wait to see your vids!
Wasn't there a NPC that invaded you that went by impaler and used frenzy flame spells?
I think that red bro is Miquella's radagon.
It's freaking Rykard the snake flames the way he says mother. I'm betting on it
That cloud in the middle of the ocean is  and Devine tower and that's a demi god  but you know don't take me seriously but that's what i think
I'm glad it's in June. Gives me time to enjoy DD2.
Messmer is Rykard's son
I remember back when I would watch and rewatch the drunkthroughs for blood borne and dark souls I miss those so much🤣🤣🛐
I think Messmer is referring to the Formless Mother referenced in Blood incantations/items
That one boss is like 3 bosses grafted together.
They' are going to be so much to discover in this game can't wait for June to come summer is Elden ring season
That lion boss looks like a western version of Lion Dance from chinese culture... you can see a hand lift up its jaw & theres a guy inside...
its the dude that let the snake eat him I think when he was young i think we have to fight all the demi gods at their prime
There is another guy holding the lion on top him I reckon he is another who has a lion has he’s familiar
Hot take, many, many enemies will be bleed resistant or even bleed immune. BUT holy damage will be a beast.
are we fighting another Lord of frenzied flame?
You should do Drake Knight armor with it
It said, "Kind Miquella." Like that was a nickname for him or something. I think that Messmer is Radagon and Merikas child. But who knows..
Just joined your membership
I think his name might be a pseudonym or a placeholder name
Miquella evolved or a secret/hidden child is who I'm going with
Just finished your dark souls 3 walkthrough now its time for Nioh! 😊😊
You can kick now & a crossbow machinegun fuck yes!!!
That’s a veil over the city, like how you’d put one over a fancy bed, definitely going to delve into the sleep/dream side of things like fia.
Can’t wait to do the dlc.
cant wait for the walkthru. This is f'ing awesome.. looks like some martial arts upgrades
Holy crap this looks amazing. I'm so pumped.
You have to remember miquella has been infected by mohgg this why it showed in the first part of the trailer her in the egg and that’s where we fought mogg and left miquella in the state of being cursed with mogg blood. That’s my opinion
Looks like you fight twisted "nightmare" versions of the Golden Lineage: 14:01 is Godwyn (spitting Deathblight), 14:57 is Radahn (the poor horse) and 15:00 would be Radagon (with his golden sword) - they look weird, because Miquella actually never saw them in real life. Also, Messmer seems to be another alter ego of his, kinda like St. Trina. Maybe he' s imagining himself to be a powerful warrior (which he was NOT).
Just made my first dragon build last night, coincidentally. Two dragon seals, Roar medallion, Roar physik, mimic summon, absolutely meeeeelts all bosses
Also looks pre 1st game
Mesmer is likely a child of the Gloam-Eyed Queen, reigning over the Realm of Shadow since her death at the hands of Maliketh. The DLC will potentially answer questions around who she was, where her domain is, and what happened in the wake of her demise.
I am doing right now new game plus 7, watching your walktrhough as it became routine listening you and this video appeared. Just bought the dlc. Can't wait for another amazing walkthrough, brother. Let's goo, Elden Lords
That is so freaking cool, very Nioh approach with the egg portal. Fromsoft never disappoints with dlc and this looks like it's gonna be huge
I’ve been playing through your ER walkthrough (btw so good, thank you) and this was my first time seeing you and well…”didn’t expect hot” 😂
Hand it over. that thing, your “Shadow of the Erdtree” DLC walkthrough. For my lady’s upgrade mats…
Does Mesmer have a frenzied eye
And I get to play on pc this time around
Messmer looks like Rykard with the snakes and stuff
Take my moneeey
Already pre ordered. Im so excited!!
The purple lightening .. seems this has to do with sleep .
Fk I miss the live dam......u sleep
When mohg stole mokaela did he create messiner
I'm wondering if this mesmer guy is Miquella that's been tainted by Mohg's blood flame. I only think that because of him asking "mother, would you truly lordship sanction one so bereft of light?" Seems to me like his tainted self is pissed because a tarnished, one bereft of grace and light, is now Elden lord. I think we have to save Miquella from his darkness in order to save the realm of shadows.
A day one buy for sure!
I think everything is in the past. They look like you get versions of other characters. The person sitting in the chair turning looks like young renalla to me and the Mesmer dude has snakes, it's almost like him and mogh were one person at one point
I definitely know what I'm doing this summer. Cannot wait.
Is it just me or does the Shadow Tree look like the Two Fingers with branches?
Haven’t played ER since completing it. Time to fire it up for a new play through, and get rid of the rust! Let’s go.🔥🔥🔥
Im so excited!! This looks so beautiful!! And it looks like we have so many more ways to punish enemies 🤘🏼 plus the collectors edition is just *chefs kiss*
Having covenants would be dope like the dark souls games
I’m hoping Alexander’s cousin shows up. And it seems like I counted 7-8 bosses.
Thanks CB
a “glintstone seal” so i can cast everything while only using one weapon slot
I'm following your walk through  of elden rings  I'm on ep 25 I hope I can finish it before the dlc come out
Curious is Mesmer is the child of miquella in his saint Trina form
19:26 This guy looks like he has a Lion grafted onto him. Is it possible it’s that one guy from the Evergaol who looked like the grafted boss In Stormveil?
could mother be miquela? he was never a dude plot twist
Weapon arts? Weapons? Summons? LETS GOOOOO!!!!!
Is it possible for a dlc to win game of  the year?
AAAAHHHHH
Blood mother is who Mohg worshiped. I’m guessing that’s who Messmer is referring to as mother considering the blood magic.
That’s Miquella’s son. Radagon and Merrika had kids… so… stands to reason that Miquella and St. Trina could too…
It’s being promoted like it is a whole new game! lol!😊
Old guy here (58 in June), looking forward to this. Going to start a new play through to get warmed up.😁
HOLLY SHIT ITS COMING OUT ON MY BIRTHDAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY LETS FKING GOOOOOOOOOOO
I’m pretty sure miquella is malenias brother so it’s gotta be the dude with the same hair.
Fuck yeah
The reference to mother is 100% Marika.
So I am definitely thinking the main theme of this dlc is going to be centered around dreams.
20.38 deffo the eye of frenzied flame
It’s being released on June 21
Let's goo, I'm so looking forward to this dlc!!! I just rebeat ds3 as a pure pyromancer just for kicks
Yeeehaaw cowboy. Give me goosebumps this I cant wait. Let's go fello Tarnished
YIPPEE
A proper pyromancy class?
Could mean the silent mother, like what mogh was keeping the egg for.
I feel its some how either Queen Marika/Radagon's son, he asked her basically "why did you let someone with no light, become elden lord"
Really thinking this is one big dream of Miquella's where the Haligtree won the tree fight. Also, more Volcano Manor stuff gets worked in?
Guess I know what I’m doing on my Bday woo!
The tree looks like the original Great Tree with the Erd Tree grafted on top sapping the life from the Great Tree so it can blossom into the Erd Tree
June 21
So who do we have to beat in elden ring to go the dlc ?
Mesmer's quote from what I've heard: "Mother, wouldst thou truly lordship sanction someone so bereft  of light?"
I belive the blonde one at the end is Miquella.
Swallow fury?
I really want the dialogue to say “I am miquella, blade of malenia”
looking at messmer reminded me of that one armour we find in farum azula that has dragon wings like cape. and he was talking about spilling blood etc so the "mother" could be the formless mother.
I think Messmers mom could be fia, the deathbed companion, or the queen/wife of rykard because of red hair. Also could be rennala because she gave birth to red haired radahn and red haired ranni before ranni gave up her body. Another alternative is he could be son of Marika and radagon.  Messmer seems to be the God of death. Because it said that all who are stripped of the grace of gold will meet death by messmers flame. It shows miquella at the end, shining with gold. I bet we see rykard, godwyn, and ranni or Melina again. I wonder where In the storyline the dlc will be placed. After the ranni ending, or what ending I wonder, maybe deathbed ending.  I’m excited to see these new weapons and also magic classes. Also eating rune bear hearts at a church like the dragons maybe? 😂
I think he's just Marika and Radagon's child. He's what the smoldering butterfly represents.
Theorizing from the description,  “The Land of Shadow. A place obscured by the Erdtree. Where the goddess Marika first set foot” Since Marika came to Lands Between from outside, the Land of Shadow seems to be Lands between but in the past I assume? Or maybe a region like the ringed city in DS3 where it has been existing since the start of Dark Souls series, or at least the first flame was lit, but obscured for a mind-numbing time?  “A land purged in an unsung battle. Set ablaze by Messmer’s flame” Since the history/lore NEVER mentioned about the Land of Shadow, and mentioning about saints and losing sides(of a war), this seems show how Marika purged the land to set the golden order in the beginning.  Judging by the M in Messemer’s name, and his loyalty/love towards Grace of Gold/light, Messemer seems to be Marika’s child, who was never mentioned.  “It was to this land that Miquella departed. Divesting himself of his flesh, his strength, his lineage. Of all things Golden” In the beginning, Miquella’s arm is shown and it’s mentioned “Touch the withered arm, and travel to the realm of shadow” It seems that IS Miquella in the egg but only a husk whilst his soul and mind traveled to the Realm of Shadow, and we will be able to reach it after defeating Mohg at least.
When the impaler lifts you up to burn you, it reminds me hard of the Moment in the Eldenring Trailer Malenia impales you and lifts you up on the tip of her sword.
That gold hair chick was Miquella other side. The female side St. Trina
Renalla & Radogan had Rykard, Ranni & Radahn, all "R" named offspring. Marika & Radogan had Miquella & Malenia, ( as well as Mohg & Morgott with Godfrey) all "M" named offspring. So given the red hair, his name starting with "M" and that he's questioning his mother "bestowing lordship" (only a Queen could do that) on one bereft of light, Mesmer must be a son of Marilka & Radagon right? Miquella & Malenias brother?
40$
Probaly rykards and ranitas kid
I started a new game + but never finished. Will I have to finish it to gain access to DLC?
Why is Nina Tucker in this DLC?
He has the snake on his head he could me something to do with Rykkard
Steam shows 06/20/24 drop.
The armor looks soooo sick ngl a majority of the elden ring armor is a little weird looking but these new sets look similar to dark souls armor
YO what if it is Malenia and Miquellas son and he’s the actual guy in the egg
I always felt like Mohg's palace had missing, or unfinished content with that cocoon and arm hanging out. Guess I'm in for a real treat. Probably a good thing I'm almost done with a 2nd playthrough finally. I got really tied up having fun with AC6!!! Can't wait.
i think the mother he's talking about is probably marika. he talks about her choosing someone "bereft of light" i think he says. a graceless tarnished turned elden lord by marriage of marika. maybe she had a third (maybe 4th. melina?) kid with radagon.
It's no FUGS though
How’s this a dlc it seems like a whole new game 😂😂
I didn't know you worked with the VA. As a veteran thank you !
June feels like another long time of pain and agony without DLC
Wait.. Is this a seperate game or an expansion?? 👀 Since when can you pre order a DLC and have collectors edition for dlc? 😂
I'm just hoping they add a couple more build slots for characters
Ayyy FUUUUUKKKK YEAHH!!!! 😤🙌
I think we're goin into Miquellas dream cuz his great tree was crooked.
Damn I can’t wait for this!
Betting Messmer is the snake and the body is Miquella's.
Buckle up girls!
Yes yes back to pain and suffering ❤
How can I purchase the art book and figure?
Hype. Very excited. Thanks, Team. See you there.
It could be miquellas new rebirth form
red hair can only confirm radagon lineage
I thought it was Miquella to it fits the discrimination of him and he was the one in the egg, and then he talks about mother, just what kind Miquella is doing here... I know the name is messmer but it's screaming miquella
I think the characters and enemies are dream amalgamations of main storyline characters. That Serosh looking thing seems to have a bit of the Omen twins in it, and Mesmer is a mix of Rykard and Malenia.
The 3 boss reminded me of vicar amilia bloodborne
Looking forward to your DLC guides.  They helped me out a lot!
Looks like they added a melee attack that is what the Monks do in Sekiro. Also Bonefist might make a return it seems from Ds2.
Something to note 15:31  miquella's Haligtree was supposed to grow into a double trunk tree kinda like a caduses snake like
Bro is probably Rykard and Tanith's offspring. The setting looks like Volcano Manor.
you definitely access the dlc by touching the egg after defeating mohg
Yes I will be doing a walkthrough.
No godskin quartet?
خش علي بالزاكيييييييي
The Mother they are referring to is probably the Formless Mother.
I’m a vet. Thanks Cowboy
I'd that rykard?
$49.99 for the Premium DLC  it's has to be a new game Map!
June feels like an eternity from now
dude, I'm so excited!
The Skinny Red Boss Dude is Rykard or is related to him
Them Boys cooking 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yayaya
Hey
He looks similar to the Drake armour set
Round 2 with maliketh
They ain’t high enough
It appears to me like they made a replica of the main map. Meaning that we essentially have a whole new game in DLC. It looks EPIC
my lvl 500 char is ready😂
Just watched it on Waifu channel. Holy damn!
