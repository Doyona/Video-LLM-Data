Unfortunately bro can’t do it in the prem 😂
Leverkusen fans staying loyal meanwhile 95% of Germany are glory-hunting Bayern Munich. And tbh the Leverkusen road to the win is 1 of the best iv seen in awhile in the Bundesliga  EDIT: and you have to respect Wirtz for not running over to daddy Bayern Munich instantly and actually having ambition and having the guts to leave the comfort of Germany to try something new
Of course this video was recommended to me today as a Liverpool supporter.  Sad for Leverkusen as Frimpong & Wirtz are two special players but so happy to see them play with Van Dijk, Salah, Alexis, Gakpo & so on.  I also hope Quansah does very well for you guys at Leverkusen.  I am definitely coming over there to watch a game as well - yourselves but also a Dortmund game.  Brilliant atmospheres.
LIVERPOOL are getting an AMAZING PLAYER in WIRTZ
I only clicked on this video for the wirtz hat trick because I am a liverpool fan what a signing he will be😁
watching those highlights, Wirtz was miles ahead of anyone on that pitch and at that time he would've probably still been around 20
Welcome to liverpool lads❤ both of of you
Now he’s at Liverpool
HERE WE GO WELCOME TO LIVERPOOL
That Wirtz has potential, someone should sign him up.
This Wirtz guy has potential - watch this space
Only commenting because hes joining Liverpool😊😊
Can’t wait for him to sign for Liverpool in the future. What a player
*I STILL GET GOOSEBUMPS WATCHING THIS ONE YEAR LATER 🍿 🔥*
Security: "we've got this guys"   🏃‍♂️ 🏃‍♂️ 🏃‍♀️
Who is this commentator
So sad they lost that run 😢😢
I am in the day after match day 34 never losing did not loose all season
Spanish coach. German manpower.  Best win combo
😮😮😮😮
2:18 "its bonisface" 😂😂😂
The third goal reminded me of Ronaldo’s goal years ago it flew in
Destroyed.
Xavier alonso bringing the clubs first ever title, what an achievement, he should stay and build from there before going to a big club destroying his legacy. He should try and see if he can win champions league with this club
❤
Congratulations leverkusen, what an incredible season.
Congrats Leverkusen and Leverkusen fans! ♥
Never been happier for an ex-Arsenal player than Xhaka. What a season he's had. ❤
Congrats Leve and xhaka  from an arsenal fan 🖤🖤🖤🖤
Huge for German Football, absolutely huge. Congratulations to Leverkusen! However, my only criticism is this.....At the crowning of a different champion to win the Bundesliga, why on EARTH are they playing 'Land of hope and Glory' which is a VERY patriotic British piece of music..lmao. Especiialy considering it's the first time since 2012 I think? That anyone other than Bayern Munich has been champions, and ESPECIALLY since it's the first time in Leverkusens history...At their biggest achievement to date, a patriotic British anthem is playing...seems.....very weird.
Why were they playing Land of Hope & Glory?
Kane at home crying
So happy for Xhaka - (Arsenal fan).
With 5 matches still to play? Just Awesome
hattrick and league title in 1 game what a day for wirtz
Bravo Bayer Leverkusen
Fantastico 🎉🎉
😮😮😮😮😮
Wish he didn't go for mainly Fords
Levs have got a really great strip.
And the lesson is, leave Arsenal and you might just win something
congratulations well deserved 💯🫡
Fantastic
Im so happy for Xhaka.. He deserve this
Don’t worry harry kane. There’s always next season 😉😂😂
Great for Leverkusen.   Unfortunately the only reason anyone cares is because it’s worth celebrating that it’s NOT Bayern. Not because it IS Leverkusen (except fans of course).   This is where City have taken the Prem. do we have a competition anymore?
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWW
Kane is cursed
Miss you Nathan Tella 🥲
So happy for granit xhaka
2:48 And Wirtz.... OOOAAEERRGGHH 😂😂😂
what a season and it's not over yet
He’s doing the shouting the surname again. AARRGH. Granit XHAKA.  BONIFACE.  Florian WIIIIIIIIIIIRTZZZZZ
Dear Sky Sports, can I please have a job as co commentator? I can also say “Oh!” and “Ahhhhhhhh!” 😂😂  Pause! 😂
Well played GG
Leverkusen! What a story! What a team!
Top qualify cameras
top team
Bayern Munich's luck ran out....
So pleased for everyone at Leverkusen what a season and an incredible league title beating the money men at Bayern Munich .....just love it no title for them wirz is a superstar in the making Alonso one of football's good guys and happy for gooner granit too what a team no big name stars just a great team ...... Leverkusen fans enjoy this
Awesome
Macho man Randy savage coming out to celebrate was he 😢
Micheal Ballack.
sheepotech
I still remember that awesome team of 01/02 containing the likes of Kirsten, Berbatov, Bastürk, Ballack, Ramelow, Schneider, Zé Roberto, Nowotny, Lucio and Butt etc - they finished runners up in the Bundesliga DFB Pokal and the UCL, how they never won a trophy that season I’ll never know, incredibly unlucky team. Glad they found Alonso
Wirts is special
If it was the prem, xhakas goal would be cancelled out and they would claim the offside player was obstructing the view of the keeper. Glad Bundesliga doesn’t do that crap. Fair play. It’s not over yet tho would love to see them go unbeaten
Wow xhaka has just WOW
Incredible achievement. But I can’t help thinking that the Bayer fans weren’t THAT mental. Where were the absolute limbs??
Why are they playing the American graduation song? 😂
The curse of Kane strikes again. Next stop, the euros.
Well done Leverkusen but RIP let the manager and team dismantling start
The Bundesliga is a big so what league! Even Klopp managed to win 2 titles there!
Wirtz is going to cost someone an absolute fortune in a year or two.
"Ooooaaaaaahooooo" - commentary
Are you watching Harry Kane
Amazing scenes hold that Bayern Munich
Earlier in the game the scoreboard within the stadium said 5-0 to Leverkusen. The score was 1-0 then. Whoever put that up by mistake definitely saw the future.
Well done Bayer 👍
Game probably should have been stopped on safety ground tbh, however brilliant result and season from Bayer, congrats.
Co-comms is gonna need a fresh set of Y fronts
Fair play
Harry kane thought he was going to win bundesliga , alonso,  hold my beer 🍺
Arsenal will never change another player thats gone on to win a trophy after leaving arsenal while we still bottle things
That penalty even a goal is such a bad penalty taken its incredible..
This team has balls of steel, Alonso has been a breath of fresh air. Congratulations Leverkusen, Never seen a more worthy champions.
👏👏👏👏👏
kocham to
Llongyfarchiadau, Granit....coyg
What a story. Well done Leverkusen. Alonso is special and has his team playing special football. So hope they go undefeated in all comps
From an Arsenal fan, congratulations, congratulations being an invincible, only a few clubs around the world can hold that claim. Enjoy this moment, well deserved 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Florian is a menace to society & is my golden boot winner at the euros. Well done Bayer Leverkusen! 🎉
I changed the likes from 8.4k to 8.5k when I liked
leverkusen
Did they just play land of honour and glory at the end? How British
Well done Bayer Leverkusen, truly deserved
Who is this other commentator making these stupid noises?? Stop because you aren’t cool
Finally a team in the bundesliga that didn't bottle it
Bayern have only not won the Bundesliga because of Harry Kane 💀
Sure, when you win the German title that emphatically why not play Land of Hope and Glory at the end
Xabi Alonso is clearly the player of a FIFA manager mode playthrough and he selected amateur difficulty.
I was waiting to Randy savage to turn up
Wow. From a Man City fan that was absolutely awesome. It brings back so many memories of our own Agueroooooo moment back in 11/12 season. Well done. What an awesome team this Leverkusen is. ❤
Just wait until they meet the mighty Hammers…..they may be brought to there knees….😂😪😪
The beautiful game - Congratulations Leverkusen
The one season Kane joins Bayern they dont win the bundesliga
Sports enhancement drugs
Can’t blame the fan’s running on pitch before it’s over they waited long enough well done Bayer 04 fully deserved
Poor Kane - went to Bayern Munich to win trophies which was a no-brainer idea considering they have been ruling the Bundesliga since ever, and end up in the same situation as before: talented but tropheless.
Very well deserved. Congrats to Leverkusen
Amazing
#1 ON TRENDING
Congratulations Xabi Alonso!😊😊😊
now bayern is going to come and sniff these players this summer :( and they won't say no
Not sure who the pundit is but did they contribute anything more than "AHHHHHH"
They deserve it all, worked really hard for it
Aus! Aus! Das spiel ist aus!
CHAMPIONS!!!!!🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
Amazing work from such an entertaining team!
Congrats ! Bayer Leverkusen from an Imp.
crazy for Tella
Finally someone that isn't Bayern
Never a penalty but that's besides the point. Terrific achievement.
Every few seconds...."ahhhhh"
Who is this commentator just shouting oooooooooooooo every time
Well done Leverkusen  Next up the europa league  Brilliant team  Alonso is the man
smart from Wirtz to get a hatrick and match ball - that will be worth a lot of money in the future ;D
agent xhaka successfully dispatched to prevent kane from winning a trophy. good work agent xhaka.
👍
Imagine being a fan at that game I wouldn’t stop partying for weeks 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Congratulations to Leverkusen🎉🎉🎉Truly remarkable achievement. Outstanding consistency. Thoroughly deserved. Love from London❤
Leverkusen crowned as Macho Man Randy Savage.
Alonso’s Army congratulations!
The second commentator was so bloody irritating!! Say something
I love that they’re playing “Land of Hope and Glory” - an English anthem!
Elgar?   Wagner surely.
What an achievement.
Incredible achievement and what a way to seal it too 😮
Welcome to Arsenal Wirtz
Commentator sounds like me on the bog
Love the land of hope and glory at the end. Well done everyone at the club.
Xhaka left Arsenal and Arteta to achieve great things and win. Great decision.
Congrats to Xabi, and his brother, Fernando.
Can’t beat macho man music at the end ❤
Quality team. Looking forward to seeing them in CL next season
Bayer Leverkusen goal:   2nd Commentator: ARGHHHHHHHHHH!!!! 😂😂
Congratulations to Bayer Leverkusen , i have been watching the Bundesliga all season, to see how Harry Kane does. But the biggest ticket this season was not Kane, it was that fantastic season Leverkusen had ,again well done to Leverkusen.
What a manager, what a team, what a season.  BAYER 04 LEVERKUSEN.
Tella went from Southampton to winning the league 😂
Congrats  leverkusen unreal 👏🏻
Unreal honestly, Congratulations Xabi’s Leverkusen❤️
Well done BL from a Man City fan 👍🍺🍺🍺
Good ref just blowing the final whistle 👌👍
The 11 year streak is finally over, congrats to Bayer Leverkusen 🎉
Harry Kane still not won anything 😂
They really went and won it while being unbeaten.. well done Bayer!
Miss granit
All thanks to Harry Kane bringing the spurs curse to Germany 😂
Congratulations from Glasgow Celtic enjoy the party 🎉
Ooooh kane!!!😅😅
What a team hats 🎩 off
Leverkusen turning prime Brazilian team once realizing Kane wants to win a trophy:
Manager: Xabi.  Assist: Kanes Curse  Goals: Fullbacks.
A minute of silence for Harry Kane please 😂 you can take the boy out of Spurs but never take the Spursy out the boy! YOU LOVE TO SEE IT 😂😂😂
Well done Xabi. Ledge.❤
Wirtz hatrick ball will be worth a few Quid
who is that bremen keeper... terrible
Absolutely loved the other commentator 😂 nothing but perfect reactions for every goal and near miss
Outstanding stuff Leverkusen 👏
Got you say. Lovely to Leverkusen back up there Bayern not being dominant the last 10-12 years more. Super super stuff they'll go all the way unbeaten 👊 bank on it
Football fans were never united like this
Hope like Ajax they don't break this team up. Team is full on world class
Congratulations 🎉🥳🥳🥳 Leverkusen for becoming bundeliga champions 🎉 so happy for this great feet
spanish brand one more time around the world... if you wanna win something in your miserable live call a spaniard, thats it.
Winning the league by miles is a massive achievement! True class
Love it
If they go unbeaten then it means more than 11 x years of Bayern winning
Masterclass
What an amazing achievement.....congratulations to you all.
The German cup final and Europa to go! Go on Leverkuson, you can do it! 🔥
What a amazing team what a amazing Alonso they deserve congratulations to them, and love for my Shqipe Xhaka!! 🇦🇱🇦🇱
Last time Bayern Munich failed to win the title Klopp went back to back with Dortmund and then Munich signed Gotze, Hummels and Lewandowski from Dortmund destroying his side. Munich go on to win ELEVEN titles in a row. What are the chances Munich end up with Wirtz, Alonso and Frimpong by the start of the 25/26 season?
Congratulations to Leverkusen, what a season!
Is the second commentator about to bust or something 😂😂
All credit to the boss sticking with his unbeaten team in all competitions for next season. Could be lst team in history to go unbeaten all season
Willing to bare knuckle box anyone who doesn’t consider Florian wirtz one of the top 3 talents in world football. Kids been slept on and probably still would be if Leverkusen weren’t doing what there doing.
That Xhaka lad looks good, Arsenal could do with him 🤣
Amazing
Xhaka abused by Arsenal fans for years only to leave & go invincible, incredible
Xhaka finally has some silverware. Well done from Arsenal
Fantastic achievement what a team
Im happy for leverkusen
Thought randy savage was coming out at the end
Congratulations to Leverkusen, incredible! Sealing their first ever title in style. What a hat trick from Wirtz, generational talent, but is no one going to talk about that Xhaka goal?! In any normal game that goal would be making the headlines! We’ve seen him do it on from outside the box on rare occasions at Arsenal, but what a pleasure to see him get the crucial second goal here to win the Bundesliga, after coming so close to winning the PL last season.
Lol kane curse
Commentary is absolutely shocking, The guy keeps moaning, Embarrassing.
Screamers n screamers
🎉🎉🎉🎉
I'm a City fan and not a fan of pitch invasions. Stand back and watch, let the players enjoy there moment. You force the players off the pitch and the club also receives big fines.
Isn't the Xhaka goal offside?
What an achievement for Leverkusen! Only bad thing is the squad getting ripped apart by clubs wanting the best players but then they become a more interesting club for talent.
Where is Leverkusen in the Champions League?
Boniface is the best striker in the league. Forget tap in Barry Kane the stat padder. This Leverkusen team are relentless every game. They keep the ball and squeeze and squeeze and squeeze. Can score all sorts of goals, and have some great strikers of a ball - grimaldo, wirtz, xhaka, Hoffman
What me and Alonso Have done with this team is shirt of a miracle, more to come! ❤🏆
Ah well it's ok because Kane had a great season 😅
Well done, Xabi Lad! Ynwa
Did they just play "land of hope and glory" at the end?? Cool...but a wee bit strange!!
Happy for Granit Xhaka 😅
Xhaka will be arsnl biggest regret , 🎉🎉🎉
Champions league be ready
I really hope Alonso doesn't just jump ship, if he stays at Leverkusen and this kind of form continues next season, he could make a new power house club in Europe.
Wirtz must feel on top of the world right now
Harry Kane crying !!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't even support Leverkusen but a fairytale run like this is just beautiful to watch
Gotta be the greatest proper managerial debut of all time
Greatest team in Europe right now
He coaches the way he played: flawlessly and with tact.
Well done Leverkusen delighted for Alonso,as a Liverpool fan,hopefully he will be back at the club one day
Xhakas performance for BL surprised me, he showed nowhere near this potential at Arsenal
I really think Harry Kane is a LEVERKUSEN legend! He came to Bayern for Bayer  to win the league!😄
Harry Kane f**ked it for Bayern
I hope this team stays somewhat intact for the CL, they have been magnificent
From a benfica fan, congratulations to Leverkusen for the tittle. Well deserved, beautiful football. Gonna be interesting to see them in the CL next season if they keep their best players and alonso ❤
So happy for Xhaka! Congratulations Leverkusen 🎉 Amazing season
Hilarious commentary
Congratulations from a Tottenham fan!
And Xhaka won the league as soon as he left Arsenal
Harry kane thought of tge idea if moving country and team that wins a trophy every year…. Lmao i feel kind if bad for him
This is up there with the Leicester story 100% unbelievable achievement
Werder Bremen goalkeeper just let them to score no reaction at all 😂😂😂,, congratulations Bayern Leverkusen as a team they deserved to be champions 🏆🏆
Well played Leverkusen!! Fantastic season. And my word, Wirtz what a stunning goal that is!! Free kick style shot!
Finally the Bundesliga is competitive
I watched the match live and they really are the real deal. So complete, disciplined and dominant in their style of play which makes it difficult for any opponents to overcome. Fully deserved glory for Bayer Leverkusen! 👏👏
Well done Alonso, amazing achievement. Wish you were coming to Liverpool. Maybe some other time 🏆
Nathan Telle! From Certain Prem Relegation with BURNLEY to Bundesliga Champion with Bayer Leverkusen! WHAT were Burnley thinking! Letting him go will cost them around £150M in lost Prem money!? He might have kept them up, and Leverkusen might not have become Champions! Strange World Football! 😂😮
They only went and won the champs leauge on my fifa Pro career year too 2027- note I do not play for them  ,  Theyre beasting in the virtual world too
Well done!
Congratulations 🎉
He needs to stay and see if the club has ambition because leaving for another club like Bayern or Liverpool would put him under unnecessary scrutiny. He has done a great job turning the bottle jobs Neverkusen into Champions and should fight to remain unbeaten throughout the season.
Kane strikes again.
Love the fact that they play Macho Man Randy Savage’s theme music as they won.
Finally some other team than bayern win you know how unpredictable it's been for over 11 years
Was that ‘Land of Hope and Glory’ playing at the end? 🇬🇧
Well done to Wirtz, what a way to score your first senior hat-trick!
good luck - hope you do it - what a team - from an arsenal fan
Congratulations to Bayer 04 Neverlosing!
Been looking forward to this. What a side.
With Alonso in charge, Kane wont win anything in his 3-4 years at Bayern! 😬
East London says so YNWA kudos BL
How ironic, Harry Kane’s first season in the Bundesliga and Munich dont win it. Im sure its destined that he aint suppose to win any title in his career
WIRTZ!
Thank Harry Kane for the Kane effect
Are you watching kane. That's a team winning not one self centered big head taking all the praise he can.
❤ Xabi is taking this team places in the champions league next season, this is clearly only the beginning
Thank god for that. Got bored of Munich winning all the time.
Nevillesque noises from the  second commentator
Well done Leverkusen 🎉🎉
Wirtz showing the Liverpool players how to finish chances. 👏🏻
^^^ Lifetime Arsenal fan:  Wow!! So happy for Granit Xhaka and everyone else involved for Bayer Leverkusen! I hope they go on to win the treble and stay unbeaten! 🏆🥇🥈🥉👏
Alonso staying because he knows he has a real chance in the Champions League next season and of course for back to back Bundesliga titles.
Congratulations Leverkusen
Many congratulations to Leverkusen. What a season, hopefully they can win the treble 😍😍😍😭
Wirtz probably had the best day of his life. A hatrick and then his team won the Bundesliga title
That co commentator though 😂😂😂
I told harry that if he wanted to win a title this season to go to bayer. He thought i said bayen. Sorry harry, i should have been clearer 😊
Congrats to Leverkusen on this relentless charge to the title.
Bayer Neverlösen
As an Arsenal fan this made me smile, well done Bayer I hope you win it next season too.
Well done what a game and season. I hope west ham give you good game this week but i can't see us beating you!
GOD loves us all so much he sent his one and only son to die for our sins
What a player Wirtz is hope city sign him 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Im Arsenal fan but my god... im biting my nails with their every game, not for them to just win the league without losing  a game but to also pull the invicible treble.. for me the that would single handedly be the greatest footballing achievement/season i have ever witnessed. Remarkable stuff
Xhaka wins title in his First season with Leverkusen is Crazy and I never Wanted him to leave Arsenal because he is a footballing Genius ….  Congratulations on your first Bundesliga Bayern Leverkusen.. 🇩🇪🌍🌟⚽️
Bayern Neverlusen 👏🏾
Wirtz would do well at Man City.
Greetings and congratulations from England to my Leverkusen fan friends Gordon S. Paul W, and last but not least Uwe v B.
So cringe running on the pitch man
Amazing achievement, great to see such an underdog take the title 👏👏👏
Leverkusen have the most chemistry in a football club I have ever seen
good lads
When Bayern Levi Played Newcastle United Under Sir Bobby Robson's Newcastle United,  I Bought 2 Pin Badges Of The Game Off The Programme Sellers In China Town Sports-Fans...  Toon Toon Black & White Army
Well deserved 👏
WWF macho Man his music playing in the background😂
The day xhaka won the bundesliga arsenal bottle it at home to villa 😂😂😂congrats  xhaka totally deserved 💪
Granit Xhaka is the closest thing Arsenal fans can dream of having silverware this season.
👏
Boniface had a bonnie face
❤ congratulations Leverkusen, wonderful achievement 🎉
Xhaka left arsenal and won the title before them😂😂
From all the way in Ireland, Glückwunsch Leverkusen!
POV Kane 😭😭😭💀💀💀
Boniface is a Bundesliga winner.
Congrats to Leverkusen
Xaka wining the league on the day Arsenal bottling it how poetic
Alonso is getting an awful lot of credit for the great work the leverkusen board has been doing over the years.
So happy Leverkusen finished it and what a performance from Wirtz. Congrats Leverkusen go again next year.
Didn’t realise Gary Neville was co-commentating lol
I  am happy for Xhaka. Imagine if he was still at Arsenal. Trophyless.
Well done frimpong from Glasgow Celtic ❤
Bravo❤
Look at how excited they are the celebrate with the fans. Love this
Watching leverkusen it’s like a game of fifa
Never thought I’d hear Land of hope and glory at a German match
This is literally the equivalent of Gerrard winning the league with Rangers, Both farmer's League's with 2 teams.
Incredible. Massive congratulations
Ohhhhhhhh
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
There gonna be so relaxed against the hammers now
Congratulations to Xhaka. He left Arsenal to win trophies 😂
The English national anthem plays as they celebrate! ?
Congrats to Leverkusen
And they have harry kane to thank
Schick was the first footballer I was ever a fan of, delighted to see his team win - and in such style!
This team is truly lethal, Xabi Alonso deserves all the plaudits for building a team that destroys the opposotion. Congrats Bayern, well deserved and yet could also lift the Europe League
Arsenal could have done with xhaka today 😂😂😂
And I just can't wait to see them this Thursday
Was meant to be
Shoutout Leverkusen
Ooh yeah Macho Man
Leverkusen is twinned with my home town of Bracknell, so we are also champions today!
Congrats Bayer Leverkusen. Ecstatic for their fans just keep Alonso away from Liverpool ok 😂😂
from a gunner well done BL well done xhaka, wins the league first time, in his first season
amazin to see, love an underdog story. I can see city winning 10 in a row under Pep hahaha
i don't think i ever watched one game of theirs but just kept hearing of their incredible runs and to see them win it is surreal, gotta say.
Casual Xhaka screamer - you love to see it.
Amazing ❤
Absolutely INSANE hatrick from wirtz
Brilliant achievement, all without spending vast amounts of money.
What a team, congrats
Arsenal 2004 and Leicester City 2016 remade
This is a great day for football. Congratulations, Alonso and Bayer 04 Leverkusen. Richly deserved and the curse has finally been lifted (not for Kane, though 😂)
Wirtz celebrating with a fan at the end 😂
Oh my word leverkusen are an unbelievable team. Some of the goals scored today are just amazing. What a job Alonso has done. Simply incredible 👏
Did the co-commentator actually say anything other than "OOOOOHHHHHHHH" "OOOOOOHHHHHH" and "OOOOHOHHHHOH"?
🎉Xahka🥇vs Arsenal😏WEEKND Woww,,
English press try to say the manager must go to Liverpool... GTF
Congratulations to Leverkusen from a Arsenal. I’m truly impressed 😢
Where was the process for Alonso in his first season? I hope they win the treble without losing, that will be the greatest achievement by any club in football.
Winning the league with your home fans undefeated with still Europa league contenders ❤🥵
I think it's important to remind folks esp. Arsenal fans, around 5 years ago, Granit received abuse and death threats to his family.  I can't credit the man enough for turning his situation around and making it happen.
Imagine Leverkusen win the Europa league too 🥵🥵  Hats off the Xabi Alonso and his team. Inspirational ❤
So happy for them
Fair play lads proud of you
Congratulations to Xhaka and Leverkusen👏
You say Bayer Leverkusen, I say Cameroon.
Congratulations
Xabi Alonso Real Madrid manager for season 2025/26 !
Congratulations to Boniface and Tella. 🇳🇬
That keeper was horrendous
Xhaka wins the Bundesliga the season after winning nothing with Arsenal. Arsenal about to win nothing AGAIN. Perennial LOSERS those lot.
I think this is the bigger thing to ever happen in the bundesliga in my opinion always from the xabi first coaching season to the players improving, every detail about leverkusen is special, anyone agree ?
Congrats bayer ❤🙏🏿
Why are security trying to stop the pitch invasion lol are they ok
Cold
Oh congrats to Leverkusen this team i love since 2005 and never realise their never won the  Bundesliga untill today what a moment for them and seeing them lifting the trophy this season is a dream come true for me!!!!! I remember winning titles with them on FIFA and now their finally won one at last in real life great achivement for them credit to Xavi Alonso and his fantastic X men
Leverkusen are going to get raided this summer.
Congratulations
Credit to Harry Kane and his influence on the spiritual realm
It’s a shame because the “bigger” clubs will just pick them apart in the transfer window in the summer. They will be a shell of this team.
Fair play manager will be gone now
Congratulations to Bayern Leverkusen 🏆👏
"Harry KAAANE" ~ Antoine Griezmann
Fair play to the ref for blowing the final whistle when he did 👏🏻
After all those years at arsenal Granit Xhaka finally knows what it’s like to win a league title 😂🏆
Football is special
Unbelievable season! 🔥 Congratulations Leverkusen!
Ironically the day Arsenal's title hoped fade Xhaka wins the league and to add scores a screamer.
Such a huge W for football as a whole, and especially German football.
Congratulations…Wirtz to City?
Farmers league, they would be bottom half of the table in the prem
Everyone. History has been made.
whys this commentator just moaning
Leverkusens longshot ability is insane
Xhaka winning the title while Arsenal dented their chances thanks to Emery. Outrageous.
Harry Kane has brought Spurs' Curse to Bayern.
Every captain that's left arsenal has gone to become league championship 😂
Brilliant achievement from a man utd fan
What is the second commentator doing 😂
Well done and well deserved Leverkusen!! 👍👏🏆 MCFC OK
Xhaka knew he had to leave Arsenal to have any hope of winning a title.
Well done! Sod to selfish Bayern.
people do realise Leverkusen are exempt from 50+1 right?
Congratulations to Leverkusen , about time someone dethroned Bayern. If Wrtiz ever leaves he’s going for atleast 200M. What a player !!!!
Tuchel doing it again (Poch gets the blame cause he was the one there at the end of the season, but Lille won the league due to Tuchels first half)
Real invincible
Congratulations to Alonso and everyone involved. Very fitting Wirtz scores his first ever hat-trick as Leverkusen lift there trophy. Now let’s see if Alonso can win it next year when pressure is on
They just need to win europa league now
🎉🎉🎉🎉
It’s the history of the tottenham
Job very well done 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻special…..
Stefan's commentary contributions were so insightful.
Congratulations Leverkusen
Did I hear 'Land of Hope and Glory' at the end there?
Well played Leverkeusen and Alonso!
I hope they also win the Europa .
Astonishing job done.👏
Absolutely Refreshing
Land of hope and glory ,,
its something when a German team play a British anthem at the end of the game. Land of hope and glory XD XD
they will still go out of europe to west ham next week  😂
We need a fsirytale like this in England, Man City winning every year is a total bore.
Wow! Huge credit and respect to Bayer Leverkusen & Alonso, what an astonishing achievement from both and they so deserve to go unbeaten for the rest of the Bundesliga campaign.
Not lost a game all season lost out on 8 points all season tremendous job could win again next year adding some players
Well done from a Celtic fan well deserved 👏🏽👏🏽🍀🍀🍀
El elegido
Going to see loads of Hipsters now claiming they’ve been Leverkusen fans for years now.
Well done Leverkusen, amazing season
From a Glasgow Celtic fan, an absolutely amazing season for  Leverkusen. Congratulations. Anyone who dethrones Bayern deserves enormous credit
From a tottenham fan in England, congratulations to bayer Leverkusen,amazing just wish my team could do the same ,alonso brilliant respect
They should give Werder the win because they stormed the pitch before the game was over
a 5-0 win with a first brilliant hattrick for the starboy, a rare goal that's a screamer for the new signing anchor of the team and the returning striker getting 2 g/a to win the league 2 months early is crazy
Yes xhaka watched it live what a goal left peg , very well done bayern alonso the new wenger now i hope he stays and trues to continue will be madness 🎉
Now he goes to Liverpool.
Congrats shame he isnt coming to LFC
Congratulations Bayer 04 Leverkusen. New Deutsche Meister German Budesliga 🇩🇪. First time ever in history. Bayern Munchen not win champion. Very very very very very good 👍. I remember in Bayer Leverkusen magnificent Andrzej Buncol 🇵🇱 ❤️ and magnificent Jacek Krzynowek 🇵🇱 ❤️. Congratulations Leverkusen once again. Greetings from Leicester UK 🇬🇧. Godbless.
I’m proud of Leverkusen
I can feel the joy and I don't even support them :)
Poor Harry 😢
Man city fan! What a team this bayern leverkusen is 💯 congratulations lads incredible achievement
British anthem being played at end of game😂😂😂😂😂
Congratulations Bayer Leverkusen! Bright day for German football, but a dark day for English football 😔
Congrats to Xhaka Invincible
The cut to Wertz's hat trick goal being blocked by flare smoke made me lol
Macho man theme was elite audio
Xhaka had a lucky escape he would be at Arsenal bottlers
Now Arteta can learn one or two
Wow 😂😂YNWA 🎉❤❤😊
Florian Wirtz is a special talent
The sheer excitement of the fans who couldn't wait to celebrate, having to be told to wait by the players after scoring, was such a beautiful sight. You deserve it Leverkusen enjoy it and savor it, this is your day and your trophy. BRAVO
Brilliant, the icing on the cake will be Stuggart taking second spot 😂😂😂
Well done Nathan Tella. Two titles in two seasons
Wirtz is a SPECIAL talent, for me, we a looking at a future Ballon D'Or winner at some point
🎉
Neverlusen
The one good thing that came from today, our guy Xhaka scored 💪🏾
Congratulations!! What a story!!
BAYERN NEVERLUSEN.
The co-commentator ruining every big moment by screaming 'OOOoooOOOO' over it wasn't annoying at all.
Xabi alonso take a bow! Theyl end up winning europa aswell
i’m jealous of those fans at this game it must’ve been crazy
what a game to win the title omg
Let’s not forget that this is still the league that Bayern Munich won 11 years in a row…….
West Ham win thur that will have took a lot out of you mr aspden
Boniface came back strong for the team
What a team this is, i hope they dont get dismantled during the summer transfer, on the other hand HERE WE GO KANE TO MAN CITY 😂 we need new prem champions 😂😂😅
Boniface celebrations make me laugh my Nigeria man
The 2023/24 Bundesliga season is over! Congratulations Bayer Leverkusen! Hard luck Bayern Munich!
Amazing! Tore title from Bayern after eleven years of complacency, undefeated in all competitions since beginning of season (only five draws), play attacking football and could win treble. Say no more…
There are probably Dortmund fans who would rather have Bayern win another one than have Leverkusen be the ones to break the monopoly.
Xabi alonse Madrid 24/25

Congratz Bayer Leverkusen. This Bundesliga season has been amazing 🎉🎉

Team of the season in Europe, without a doubt! 😊
Wirtz will be a special player if he isnt already.. wow
At this point make Harry Kane his own trophy
What a fabulous performance and i bet they'll go undefeated too, thoroughly well deserved boys, well done.   🤗🤗👏👏👏👍👍💐💐❤️❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Kane should have joined Manchester City when he had the chance, so now  he'll end up with a career that generated zero trophies. Shame that.
The second best team in Europe after Man City.
Xhaka secured leverkusen's title whilst arsenal just bottled theirs lol
What a time to be alive ✌️
All goals scored from outside the eighteen yard box are xabi alonso genetics and master class
Been breath of fresh air for Bundesliga under alonso, there was any team to stop Bayern dominance this is it, fans/players dreamt this day
Respect to Alonso, and everyone associated with Leverkusen that’s how to win a title. Congratulations 🎉🎉

43 games unbeaten, Bundesliga champions, cup finalists, possible treble with Europa league , best team in Europe this season no question, congrats to Leverkusen
Xhaka really ran away from arsenal to go invincible 😂😂

Regardless of what team you support, we are celebrating this as if our team won the league. We love Xabi Alonso. ⚫ 🔴

From Neverkusen to Never Losing. On their way to becoming true invincibles. What a story

What an incredible team, it was about time  for Bayern's dominance to be ended. Congratulations to Leverkusen for winning the first bundesliga in their history 🥳
THIS WILL BE REMEMBERED AS THE BEST & MOST ACHIEVED THING THE UNDERDOGS HAVE DONE WITH THE EX - BAYERN MUNICH PLAYER XABI ALONSO.🤯.
What Alonso has turned this team into is up their with the great achievements by great managers of the past. Outstanding.
Well done Leverkusen, totally deserved to win the Bundesliga.
The second commentator was just making noises 😂
Goals from every position in this Bayer Leverkusan team this season. Hard to find nowadays. Pretty frightening really, hopefully they can keep the team together next season but doubt it..
What a team 😤
