Should I add extra outlets for hobby sheds?
The penny inlay "signature" is a great idea.  Your build is great.
Very beautiful house ❤❤❤
With all this advertising for your sponsors it is becoming Boring.
Do you still have a deal with the flaslite company.
Simply Safe is also a food safety course that people in the food industry have to take. I took it years ago.
did the wind goes throw the log cracks?
Love this show
Looks like you have power in the cabin but no bathroom? 🤔
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
❤❤❤❤
Awesome as usually. I’m sure you miss the help of your dad. Floor is perfect looking forward to next video I’ve been telling my wife about you and the cabin. She said that I am obsessed with this build. I said there is so much more than just a cabin build. She is now watching with me.

You don't have  a patio in front of the log cabin.  Kindly make one so that log cabin  may look good  from out side as well. Also cover base from all four sides.
Hi! А как обстоят дела с дикими животными в лесу? Медведи или волки? Отличная работа проделана! Всё подогнанно до миллиметра, смотрю с видео с удовольствием!
I just subbed to your channel however I had seen some of your videos on making the cabin etc etc sorry for your loss that cabin will be memories for a life time and you have videos to show your future children their grandpa and you building it
What's that black shit you put on the floor and what did you put between the logs? Just cement ?  Can you tells us why you used what you used? Why didn't you use spray foam ?
Your cabin is so beautiful
Omg your skills and strength is out of this world.  You must be a math genius.  Precise and clean. Wow!
I watched with love all the videos of the portable cabin you took with the sled for the first time, and then the exquisite cabin you made with your father. Your father and you were amazing people. You are a very intelligent, talented, very strong man with a big heart. Lastly, I was very sorry about your father's death because it was as if I was with you while he was making the cabin. Now I know your life story. I wish your wife, daughter and you a healthy and happy years and I'm very curious about where you put that amazing epoxy door and how it looks. From another continent... With love! 😘💝💖❤💞🙏🙏🙏
Awesome, brother
The workmanship on this build is amazing. Great care is obviously taken to make sure that everything fits snugly together. Amazing skill and talent. The cabin looks magnificent. It’s been a joy to watch these build episodes. 😊👍
👏👏🙋
As a Canadian I I feel honored that you included Canadian pennies.
Such beautiful workmanship! A true artist with wood ❤️
既然家里有电源和电池，那么防火就显得比较重要。应该要装几个小传感器会比较安全。
Thank you for showing this series working with your Dad. I've enjoyed watching them. RIP Sr. Outsider, you legacy will live for generations to come!
عمل ممتاز متقن أكثر من رائع ما شاء الله 👍⚘
What would keep tree roots from breaking into the conduit once it's in the ground?
Routering those corners on the ship lap takes practice and a sharp bit. It’s been a while but I remember struggling with it a bit.
122122/0421h PST 🇺🇸 Thank you. Good to see the PV systems being installed and fully functional. The design is very simple, unlike I’ve seen, watched, read and observed. I think, PV systems are simple systems, but people can make it look extremely complicated similar to a Nuclear Power System. I tell this from experience. Your relentless endeavor is highly appreciated and admired. Bravo. Bless you, Sir and 73s…
Jeez I hope you AirBnB this once it's all done!
THANKS JEHOVAH YHWH BLESS YOU BROTHER DADDY WIFE AND DAUGHTER Deuteronomy 31 6 Be Courageous And Strong Do Not Be Afraid Or Struck With Terror Before Them For Jehovah Yhwh Your God Is The One Marching With You He Will Neither Desert You Nor Abandon You Amen THANKS LOVE ENDURES ALL THINGS
🖐👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
love the floors with the pennies. I hope you made a template and didn't measure every screw?
That looks really shallow for burying a power cable. Is that code compliant in Canada?
I think it's referred to as caulking the chinks.
Nayes 👊👊👊
Add some 2” steel pipe into the ground next to the base of the array
Super
Охиреть построил целый дом в лесу
A suggestion if I may.  Place large rocks over the buried conduit in strategic locations so you can not only identify the location but to also to help the conduit from pushing up with the ground temp / moisture expansion.
Beautiful cabin. Super sturdy. Thing will be there for 100 years.
what type of boards are they?
💙
❤️🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩😃👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🙏
why did you put the power pack machine in the main room? instead of underneath next to the batteries?  looks like hell in that nice cabin.
Is there anyway to get a little heat the batteries in the winter time. Batteries hate cold weather. Simply amazing job you are doing.
Very nice job.
I have a question for you. The tool you used to remove wood around the screws for the pennies was a router and what type of bit?
He is there with you in spirit brother in everything that you do he is all a part of what y’all have done from the start
wow
I remember when you worked alone sanding the wood... And you had an accident.. I was shookt and you handled it like a pro!  Take care Mann!  I'm catching up with all your uploads!  Sr outsider is with us!
That floor will pop out at some point, too little room for it to expand cos of the moisture it is gonna get since the cabin aint on 24/7 heat.. happened at my cabin too, even thought we left plenty of room for wooden floor to expand, also you still need that heat storing brick/mortar fire place, it saves you so much wood in the winter and generally makes the life easier since you need to heat it only every 2-3 days.
Amazing
I've watched this beautiful perfect cabin from the 1st day being built from the anchors being drilled into the Boulders unit present, what an amazing journey its been and I'm blessed to have had this experience with the whole outsider family ty
Expansion and contraction
A common way to anchor deer blinds against the wind would work well for your array. I pound steel fence posts at an angle into the ground about 5-8 feet from my blind and use twisted steel cable/wire attached to a ring on the post and to the blind on all 4 sides.   Another option is to use “ground anchors” you twist into the ground and light chain or straps attached to the array.
The sound of the squeaks and crackles of the boards reminds me of the house I grew up in as a child. From the bathroom to the bedroom, dining and living room the floor squeaked and crackled just got that one could trace it he path of anyone. Many often think of such as cozy or character in a place, but have it for years and then not means many things. One of which is a trip to the kitchen or bathroom at night isn't a symphony of sound when you are attempting to be quiet.
I was wondering when you would trim those branches. lol
How did you keep the raw wood from warping in all that moisture? I live in Florida and when a rain storm like that moves through and I am working in an unairconditioned space the wood just expands. I try to buy seasoned dry lumber but if it sits on site for more than a day or two it expands and warps and doesn't fit as well. Is there a trick I don't know about?
Floor might look good now, but it's gonna warp bad later.
Good to see the Queens head! It had me thinking since I was assuming you are in the USA; my bad and apologies.
What do you call this thingy at 9:37 to mark a straight line?
I assume you will be installing some sort of dry toilet system. I have a dry toilet (using a off the shelf email/fax seperator) in my campervan and let me tell you: it is great. Forget the porta potty's or other water based toilet systems...Go dry, especially since you have a seemingly endless supply of sawdust comming from the saw mill... The emails can be either collected in a small drum or even better piped outside to a small leach field whereas the faxes and sawdust can be collected in a bucket (possibly underneath the cabin, slid out and emptied in a nearby composting/aging facility (which would consist of a couple of IBC's in the ground and an open/heavily ventilated wooden/metal structure protecting it from rain and snow. Adding red wigglers and kitchen (vegetable matter) scraps would make the composting very swift...
Awesome, very very nice build. Enjoy and take care
Two stones for every dirt.
I have a ques for you are the batteries going to be ok outside on the box so they don’t get too cold ???
How deep did you bury the Cables for the Solar Panels?
Love your build!!  Hope the videos continue.    But the computerized voice,  very iritating.  Your voice is perfect for these videos.  Hope you use it more...😁
Not sure if Canada is changing their coinage to put the King's head on it but if so you could maybe leave just one hole empty and put the new penny in it. You can tell your daughter then that one penny somewhere in the cabin has the kings head.  Fun game to hunt it down, also it adds another bit of history to be handed down.
Beautiful. Fantastic design & implementation! Inspirational!
Oh wow, here you go. I had missed the last two episodes. As always, you are a master craftsman. I love those floors! I was worried though at first that you we not going to tie the planks down, but you soon removed that issue about half way through the vid with the offset screws and the penny inlays (do you heads or tail them?😅)— very nice.
Очарована вашей работой, вы мастер с золотыми руками! Всех вам благ в вашем творчестве и крепкого здоровья.
thanks , supersexy cabin . Wonderfull
Where is this cabin? I've been watching the build for a long time with your Dad. Both Very talented men.
i'd just worry about slipping on a slick floor when wet
Maybe boarding up the floor of the solar array is an option. Just weigh it down with rocks would be sufficient and the leastt amount of work too. Doesn't look bad either.
Fantastic
superb , i want the cabin
i shiplapped All my boards with half inch Dado Blades on table saw. Its way faster. But if your no hurry, this way is good to
to protect that solar array from a fallen tree, you may want to extend your framing on top of the array to give a tree something to fall on.
you could tether the solar array frame to the ground with some big metal stakes, like a tent. I can't imagine there would be a strong enough wind gust to carry it away but it might be enough to knock it off of the blocks.
im sorry for your loss bro but the memories you made on this project alone are admirable and desirable by many of us. may he rest in peace and smooth sailing on the rest of the project
This cabin is beautiful I would love to live in it enjoy
Sorry about your dad. I still miss my dad from 2016, still feels like yesterday!
Am sorry for your loss. I have missed your videos. I started the see your channel when you're half way on building the cabin.  God bless you and your family. My the protect you and your family.
I miss seeing your dad working outthere with you but I am sure he's watching over you and I sometimes start to cry because I don't see him there with you stay strong young man the good thing you will always have your beautiful memories of your dad 💙
Boa tarde! Pra mim é uma honra viu prestigiar seu trabalho, vamos sempre juntos somar e fortalecer nossos objetivos, Conto com você, eu já estou por aqui...
I am so very sorry to hear your father has passed away. All your beautiful and poignant memories will always be with you as well as his spirit. God bless you and your family. Thank you for sharing and continuing this build with us.
2 things of note... #1, why the pennies? #2, your conduit may not be buried deep enough to NEC specs. Not sure if you guys use the NEC in your part of Canada, but it should be buried 18" below the soil.
I miss you my friend.  I hope all is well.
wow that  look so beautiful project and look so Fresh air with the forest
Hope you and your family are ok 🙏
Amazing details...maybe make/design a hoe for your track vehicle and dredge that line instead of by hand. Probably won't be the last cable you bury. 🤔
A very clean new looking cabin. Nice! Thanks! 😎
Awesome Job!!! looks fantastic!!!!!  WOW
Yeah I was thinking about your Dad too...and your Mom. You've had a lot of tough experiences to go through these last couple of years. Your cabin is so beautiful and just radiates family love. God Bless you and your family; I'm sure you will make some very happy new memories there. ❤
Nice video...nice work. I have that same solar set up...EXCEPT....I siliconed my panels together, and added a few nuts and bolts, and Voila, I had a water tight roof. I put on siding, and, Voila...I had another shed. You could have that structure a useful shed, too, in just a few days work. Just be sure and shore up that foundation you talk about a little more. Keep building, Man...and keep teaching us. Thanks
. Es simpático que el traductor siga que estás  emocionadA... Creí que siendo hombre, estarías  emocionadO... . 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Luego faltaría un porshe, y un buen deck.
Yore doing a fine job, your dad would be very proud!
Красота не обыкновенная👍
Your dad is watching over you and is so proud that you are pushing on and creating a magnificent well built cabin that the two of you started. All of us who have been watching your channel know it hasn't been easy and I for one can't wait to see the cabin once it's done.
Magnificent 🤩
I don’t ever comment but I just wanted to pass my blessings on to you and your family from myself and hope that you are ok and I appreciate everything you have done. Lots of thoughts.
最後のヘアースタイルとファションは映画タクシードライバーの時のロバート・デ・ニーロですね
I would have set up a diesel generator into a collector. It would have given you better use.
You have some Chuck Norris resemblance. I agree with everything you just said and did. Just saying...
u need to have some room on edges towards the walls, because wood is expanding
I just found your channel and subscribed.   Although I don't have a long history watching you and your dad, I have been binge watching your videos and can see what a special man he was and how lucky you were to have him as a father and to be able to spend such quality time with him doing what you both love doing.  Those memories are priceless.  I am sorry for your loss.
You & your dad have great skills... Very impressed with the work you've done in the past year.. & the sacrifices you had to make... will be made up in all the memories you & your family willl have in the future....
Is it safe to keep the battery in a wooden box beneath a wooden house?
Cool
I am senegalese. I apreciate your video. Sorry for your father great man. Exemple for african
What do the pennies in the floor mean?
Absolute BEAUTY of a channel!
Just a thought. You said you plan to put stone and mortar under your under your wood stove.. Maybe use stone from the foundation of Sr outsiders childhood home.
Hello, I came up on your channel today while looking through YouTube. I love and have worked in construction all my life. I really liked what you and your father were doing as I kept watching I saw your video about your loss. I wanted to say how sorry I am that your father was called away from you and your family. Please accept my sincere condolences. I wish you all the best. God bless, a friend
trencher machine definitely then lay the conduit in as you age you will resent the wasted moves...
Hi just a thought, lots of expensive electrical equipment around now. Have you thought about locks to safeguard the property.
Bro you are an ispiration i just herd the news so sorry brother. Your legend your strong you keep fighting way to soon but soon you will be reunited do him proud snd take on all he tought you make sure you pass it on and keep the candle burning keeo yiur goals the days you dont want to fight you have to foght. Your stronger tjen me my 3rd hard loss im a mess wish i had your strength i sit in a chair for 18 hours a day move for food and weed. Your inspiring me to get up and go ahead remember that. If you need to talk bro im hear some how we will talk. All the verry best my man.
This guys uses electricity lame. My self reliance much better
That’s a well built cabin
Amazing
Omg the penny plugs are my favorite
that was painful to watch. too late now but just make a jig with a piece of wood that has the screw layout on it. Next time!
Hello, the house is very beautiful, I really want to have a house like that
Well done, good job! My wife and I are building a house in the mountains of Ukraine ourselves. Welcome to our channel, we will be glad!
Wow god nice 👏👏👏 From indonesia
i have a question is it safe with all the main logs being cracked? and will they be filled with puddy?
Beautiful cabin, sorry for your loss. Keep up the great work,your efforts are appreciated. Next time use cornstarch for the chalk lines and it will be removable blue-(sometimes very difficult to remove especially on porous materials), red, yellow and fluorescent are permanent.
Our loved ones are never really gone. They've just gone on ahead. Someday we'll catch up. And when we do we can tell them What they missed while they waited.
Measuring out the screw holes was like an offering to the OCD gods :)
Just found your channel, your cabin looks great 👍
Prayers for you and your family !!
It's so amazing what you and all your family have done. That I'm so glad to be able to watch your journey in building the cabin. Though I am curious how big is the cabin. I remember you mentioning the sizes of a 20' by 15' but nothing about a final size. It's sad that Sr. Outsider is no longer with us in person, but there are plenty of memories to remind us of the good times he was there for.
i like your house so much brader👏👏👏👏
It is always a good idea to allow a gap at the floor/ wall intersection to allow for expansion.
suggest using tongue oil not poly
Your life story is special and very inspiring!  Even through tough times, God is always true and shows himself in very special ways.  Thank you for sharing your story, your wife' story and the story of your parents.  My wife (Patty) and I found your channel a few weeks ago and we love it so much.  Your heart is open and we love that!  God bless, Steve (from Ohio, USA)
Beautiful cabin. I love the inside.
Bless
Miss seeing your dad!  But he left an indelible mark on the cabin and what a great example.
ماشاء الله عمل جيد
With the power pack you could cover it and make it look like part of the kitchen
I would build up a solid surround around and two or three feet up from the floor of the solar array and then fill it up with rocks ?
You could tie down the array feet with telephone pole cable anchors, if its possible to screw them into that ground.
When are you going to put on the back door and why have you waited?
Thank u so much for your videos. A log cabin is my future dream. I donno how in Canada but in my home country wood has become so expensive 😔 although we are a mountainous country with plenty of forests. But still I believe in my dream.
Those made for very elegant floor inlays. But what really caught me --- and evoked a very clear memory of your Dad, as it always would, each time i hear it --- was that very solid, reassuring, secure thud that heavy door made as it closed. I miss him.
I'm always waiting for episode 98! Been watching your videos since ep1 up to the latest ep. So sorry for your loss of your beloved father that he was with you all the way, from the very start building the cabin. I enjoy so much watching how you build a beautiful cabin! Your subscriber From the Philippines
Your videos are great and very interesting, and I look forward to always seeing one from you!  Keep up all the great work!  Your dad is looking down and must be so proud of you! God Bless!!
We miss your dad too. He was a gem.
Yes, the amazing behind the scenes of not only precise measuring and cutting and rotor work, with carrying things here and there, but filming and setting up the camera and then heading home to edit and get some rest!      Doing all this quality work all by yourself!    I worry about all that you have to do alone. Sr. Outsider is missed in millions of more ways than one! In thought for your care and so much you have on your shoulders all by yourself. Cheers Eastern Canada.
Trench work requires a solid level of fitness of the lower back, careful attention to when it is time to take a break and continue at another time, and smart planning. Rock on Outsider! You are doing wonderfully well. You have a lot on your shoulders without Sr. Outsider. You are a role model for showing to move things forward one small step at a time and eventually the task will get done. Patience! Cheers from Eastern Canada who admires your spirit and determination and such talent to build such a special cabin.
I caught the clip of the old wheel you found in your fathers older living area as an honour to him and his presence in the cabin build. Whoosh!  I am actually getting choked up here typing this....such an honourable act. You are a very special son Outsider. ❤‍🩹🇨🇦
oh if your dad was there :( he'd enjoy so much being under a roof he made with you.. putting the final touches to the cabin. God I hate how life works.
Hello, Bonjour from the South of France :-)
The really sad thing is you can't hire someone to do as good a job as you're doing. It's all a sea of jobbers and hacks.
Have you thought of a name for the cabin yet? If not, may I suggest Copper Cabin (for the penny inlaid floors)?
That is going to look great
The best filler between logs is a real wool. Amen
was that in floor heat tubing I seen , if so what material and shimmering method was used?
Wow I remember when you bought your saw mill before you even started noe look how far you have come awesome vids thankyou for sharing
Your home is beautiful!
Looks great, love the penny idea. Can't tell, but did you fit the flooring tight to the wall all the way around? You should allow for some Expansion and Contraction of the wood across its grain.1/2' all the way around. Hoping it doesn't buckle on you if the wood chooses to expand next Summer, or split if it shrinks this winter.
I salute you for your carpentry, artistry  skills and grit for one so young . I know somebody who tried to pass on the same talents to his sons but the new generation have other interests. My son who is of the same age as you had no role model but is honing skills like yours , buying tools . I was pleasantly surprised . I shall follow your progress .
You could use a strapping method on the solar by using anything to anchor into the ground like a trailer anchor or something better and secure it in place for possible settlement movement on rocky dirt areas I hope that at least i am thinking a cheap solution and its very easy to get ahold of without so much digging

You have many modern machines to do it
God I love thunderstorms, especially when you're snug, warm and dry. Thanks.
Burying solar cable so shallowly? What about frost heave?
Love the progress you are making
Love your hard work!! Go go fan Sweden 🇸🇪.
Some sad news , fellow YouTuber Steve Wallis, YouTube channel by same name. His wife just passed Sunday and he is having a hard time. A word of support may make him feel better.
Such a beautiful cabin. 🙂
Watching you build this cabin with your dear dad gone, shows the perseverance you have.  I miss seeing your dad even though he was a quiet soul and didn’t say a lot , he was a huge presence.  With love, from Manitoulin Island.
A beautiful log cabin in an also beautiful place
bit loose that mate,u should or tapped that up tight before scribing the central pillar
What A Brilliant Video I Love These Video        From Blue In England
Good to see ya Mr. Outsider.  Thank you.
Main floor looks great!  I love that you carried the penny detail to the main floor; looks great!  Thanks for continuing to share this journey with us.  👍
You have done some amazing work on the cabin love the penny idea to cover up screws. How's the family going?
Might consider using all those rocks and putting them over where the cable is buried to protect them and let you know in the future where NOT to dig.
What happen with the tank it’s been a while since the last time I seen it do you still have it
Great work, quite the transformation!  Really appreciate you taking the time to bring us along.  Your dad would be proud.  Praying for you and your family.  Stay safe!
Enjoyed that!! Subscribed 👍
Lol I'm still thinking about the wheel like  it's my job to come up with a idea for it. I  can not believe how much I get into watching this build. Thanks outsider great job. And I think it would look nice in the floor.
Looking as it should be. Job well done
For this cabin to use Simply Safe it would need to be on the grid.
I’ve been watching you from the  beginning. I built a log cabin also with same idea of beautiful wide plank floors. 2 Pennie’s of advice, leave a 1/2 inch gap all around  the walls. The logs will shrink and swell with change in moisture and weather/ temperature and will definitely buckle the floor.  Trust me , happened to me.  Love what your doing, made many memories with the cabin , may you do the same. 👌👍
Outsidefun1 ❤️😁
just a thought you could drill through your boards and get Anker rods to drive them down put concrete around them if needed remember what can happen with the weather someday will
Love it so much. Doing A great job, sorry your dads not with you
instead of using polyurethane on the floor have you considered using epoxy instead?? It’s a lot stronger, durable, and would last a lot longer than the polyurethane… in my humble opinion
Love the show! Deep felt condolences in losing your father! Very cool you guys got to work on your cabin together!❤️
Why didn't you have a local mill shop run that pine through a moulder to make the rabbet?  It would have saved you a lot of time and sawdust.
Congratulations on 1million 🙏🏼💚🌿
If you are likely to do more branch trimming on standing trees, have you considered a pole saw. It is a lot safer than working on a ladder and very little to break down. I've a Silky Hayauchi (6.3M pole), and it helps a lot with the high level stuff.
What was your other tool that you used for the majority of the distance as we all know that that pickax kicked your ass!  LOL. Is that why you did'nt show footage of the whole 100' distance?  Beautiful job!!!
Amazing project iv watched from day 1. You are doing the best job ever and the best  man is watching down proud i bet he is so proud of you. Lots of blessings been sent to you from Tom in yorkshire , England  uk.
How come u didn't do a episode of u hooking up the panel box n putting the battery box under the cabin?
Your cabin is absolutely beautiful!
When you add a cupboard around your power converter, you might want to have the option of venting the dissipated heat outside in Summer, inside the rest of the year.
Absolutely gorgeous!!
Wish you would show some mistakes, so the rest of us will feel better!
assisti todos os vídeos, ficou muito bom. agora uma dúvida, cadê o banheiro?!😁
It seems so strange not seeing MR Outsider by your side after all the video I seen . Take comfort in knowing how much he love being with you on this cabin build. I lost my dad in 1997 it was a very hard thing to accept. BUT we have all the goods time we shared to look back on. MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.
You could easily add a few Deadman anchors by burying a few cinder blocks with cables attached to the array frame.
Sr. Would be proud!.. you have a excellence to detail. Many professionals skip the fine rough finishing. As the cabin ages the wood will be more beautiful. As you have patience, the building becomes natural to you!!
Why shiplap and not tongue and groove flooring?
Where did you come up with the penny idea? I’ve never seen it done like that but I am intrigued
What a wonderful video.  Thank you.
Isn't it necessary to leave 1/2 to 3/4 inch space along the perimeter of the floor to wall for expansion.  Perhaps it is indeed there, but not apparent.
Thank you for the new content!  Blessings to the family.
Do you need a cook?
Wonderful work!  Your Dad is watching and smiling big!
beautiful work
man that concreat in between the logs is going two get cold bro.. log homes are horrible two hear anyways...
Pick axe! My favorite tool at the moment!
Cool video
Sry for your loss , I just lost my Dad , 91 years young . I've been watching you from the beginning feels like i know as a good friend . just one question , when did you put in the back door did i miss something ..
What about critters getting to the cables below?!
Hey Outsider - your setup looks very similar to Kris Harbours work with solar here in the UK.  If you haven't checked him out you might be able to share some tips with each other, both of you are very talented.
How deep did you burry those wires, seemed pretty shallow?
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Seeing you at work in this video I'm thinking, your dad, God rest his soul, thaught you well.
Ha ha I have never seen such caught like that, enjoy your hard caught salmon, from South Africa 🇿🇦
Your sewing machine reminds me of a joke I heard. It seems that there was a sewing machine quartet, but there wasn't a singer in the group.
Your dad is looking down at you with a smile knowing his legacy lives on in you. Never doubt his presence for he is with you always .
I strongly suspect "Chinking" was a method devised by the Chinese.
Coming along just fine 🙂 Cabin is gunna be beautiful  !! How is Mrs. Outsider and ur daughter doing ? God Bless 🙌 🙏
There is nothing better than the sound of rain on the roof of a cabin.  Awesome woodworking talent on display here.
Kept expecting Sr. Just shows he is still around in spirit ... the cabin is so beautiful ...
great job
I hope those batteries are heated.........
What a beautiful home you will have and you know how every log, screw and nail was placed.  Wow!
Thanks man. It’s so good to see you, and the progress. Heart aches for sure, missing Dad. Lots of love from New Zealand
Really 👍
That weather sounds amazing.
That camera shot you took looking out the cabin door into the 🌧 rain as it's gently watering the earth and the rustic wagon wheel was very surreal.  I really enjoy the footage you introduce while watching.  Thanks as always🤙
looking good , you must working with your dad god bless
Your Cabin is breathtakingly beautiful!!! I love the penny idea !!
Get four dog leash screw in anchors.  Use them and two ratchet straps to hold the solar array down
The cabin looks absolutely beautiful! I wish we could watch more of the thunderstorm though... And a word of advice. Have your DC to AC converter and your batteries moved to your solar panels location, maybe built a dedicated cabinet there. Having 100ft of cables transfering DC power creates huge power losses. The best way is to have AC passing through your wires all the way to the cabin itself, with little to no power loss at all. This way you will see a big improvement from your solar array!
That killed me to watch you mark every screw hole.  Chalk the line then just go buy eye, SURELY. If some don't look perfect it's probably a good thing.
Hi, I am very impressed with your skill and perseverance in building this log cabin. Indeed, your seriousness is an inspiration for me in Malaysia...........  Indirectly you have proved to the whole world the love and affection for your father by persistently continuing this project even though he is not around. Believe me, I'm sure he must be proud of you. I'm waiting for next video.
dude, ya done a great job s far. but will be waiting your next postings. thanks again for the views.
Forgive me but I do have to say you are quite the looker!
It is a beautiful cabin. You & your Dad have done a phenomenal job on it. And now you have something that should last a lifetime or two to remember your Dad by, along w/all the memories you have of him captured on film that you can go back to & review them over & over whenever you want to. I'm looking forward to all the future build out plans you have for this cabin. Ik God is letting him & your mom look down from heaven on you & see the progress of what you both have built together. They are proud of you & are waiting patiently for when the sunset's on your time here on earth & you join them in heaven. May God continue to bless you, your wife & baby girl.
4:35  Curious? - What if that beam was recessed a 1/2", so the floor boards looked like they went under it?
😍😍😍👍👍👍
Hey are your batteries insulated well enough in that box below the house? Would the winter subzero temperatures prevent them from charging properly?
Greetings from Northeast Ohio. A work of Art.
Loved the tree cutting, especially in Cedar's absence. My style completely. If that was your daughter with Christian, she is totally at ease with him. A good couple. Heath, you are blessed in life. Keep doing what you are doing. As for the shuttle between high and low, study it yourself, get the excavator back, tear it apart and replace the bad stuff. Teach yourself man, you can do it. Thanks for the great video!
This is one of my favorite channels. Nice to see you back. Miss your dad.
Thanks for sharing.
👍
It must be hard to go on building without your dad but we know that's what he would want u to do. My thoughts are with you. From Seattle''.
What a magnificent build.
Very cool need more fashion
Long day at work. Great to sit and relax and watch this episode, imagining myself in his shoes. Thank you for all the work you do to present this to all of us!
Metal Strong Tie and then drive rebar into ground and also insulated battery box
To get the greatest benefit of your solar panels you need to avoid any shading on them. On your opening shot you have foliage covering the top of the panels. That will greatly reduce it's output!! You need to clear it off.
Thank you! ❤️Looking beautiful!❤️ missing your Dad too❤️
Thank you for sharing
Don’t use polyurethane. Use Rubio Monocoat. It makes a mechanical bond with the wood and makes the floor harder.
It always amazes me how many people loved your father, myself included.. We really miss seeing him in the videos. Being a father of 3 kids your age, there is no greater joy then passing on knowledge and life skills to your children. They may not always listen, but some do. Your dad had taught you a lot of life lessons that we see today and will continue to see in the future. These skills you will no doubt pass down to your kids someday.  Keep up the great work as always. :)
Huge boulders and chain them to your solar panels to anchor them down 😊
Bravo ! from Québec
good job
Work is awesome the cabin is looking great thanks for sharing
the cabin is so beautiful, well done!
Looks awesome!
Battery box beneath the cabin? So if charging the batteries malfunctions and catches fire, the cabin burns down. hmmm
Wish I had a friend like you...
I May have missed it, but why have you done flooring before fitting/making a back door so it would be dried inn?? Regards sören ps love the build😉
will the battery box stand up to a flash flood ,strange weather everywhere ,just a thought ..
When I watch a video I like to turn my phone sideways but on this one it’s not happening🥲
Looking great.
Man I am so glad to see you keeping in such great spirits!  Seeing you roll back time and seeing your dad 💜. Thanks for Keeping us posted for sure on anything you do around the cabin !!!
I think the use of pennies is a great idea. a touch of class.
Well done my friend!  Thanks for sharing your vision and skill with us all.  Your Dad will always be with you.  Blessings
Your work is perfection!
Hello my friend. Just checking up on you to see how you are hanging in there with the lost of your dad. Always keep him in your heart. I missed seeing him during you guys building. We are still with you on this ❤️👍
I really like what your doing and it looks great and I really enjoy your videos...I don't want anyone thinking I'm knit picking...I am just mearly pointing out for others should they consider putting in a floor like yours what could be better... shiplap wood was used  for walls and floors before there was plywood and does not prevent flexing but does restrict ventilation between boards... shiplap is used for sub flooring and sub sheeting to be covered...however one edge can still flex up with warping or pressure on the wrong place making a unwanted raised seam down the road...I'm sure your floor will be just fine but it would of been better to do a 1/4 by 1/4 groove on all edges and ripped some 1/4 by 1/2 strips to put in the grooves to make a tong that would limit the flexing. .this is why all hardwood flooring sold is tong and groove instead of shiplap
You really need to protect your lungs from the wood dust, man.. I know too many old timmers that were stubborn and now have cancer or have died because of it.. Great video
I miss your good ole dad…he was a cool quiet presence always working in the background.  My feelings are nothing compared to yours and my heart is with you.
you might wanna consider just eliminating the trees from the rear of the array, chunks of ice and snow may fall on the array and damage it my friend it happened to me here in Nova Scotia...
good to see you doing well brother
Sorry for your loss. Glad to see you carrying on what you started together. It's a beautiful cabin.
It’s about time brother. I was waiting for another video. Looks great. Always a pleasure. Stay safe.
we miss your dad here's to his memory and the cabin will be your and his legacy for many years.
MORE great work and your skill level is outstanding … keep up the great work and videos … YOU inspire MANY … God Bless 👍
God bless. Stay safe.🙏🏻🥰🙏🏻🥰
Prayers for you and your family love brother... watching your channel from Pakistan
I love the Idea with the coins! Greetings from Croatia!
Everything is Beautiful . GBY Shalom
We all miss Sr. Outsider with you, as I am a member of this virtual community you have built up around you and your dad, I hope you can find some joy in this amazing achievement in not just building your cabin but all of us here as well.
Thank you again. It was short but there was a ton of work behind the scenes before the edits. Your hand-dug trench alone was pretty hard work. The countersunk pennies is a wonderful idea and it is so good to see you doing this throughout the cabin. Yes, we all miss your dad but you must miss him supremely. He'd be proud of your continued dedication to the project and we all, as viewers, are so very moved by your work in honour of your dad. Trust you know the comfort from the God of all comfort. Blessings.
That is a work of art! Your Mom and Dad would be very proud of you. You should also be very proud of yourself!
I don’t get the Pennie’s ?  What’s that about? Looks? Why not just caulk or fill with wood filler?
The cabin looks great! I think I would put in some kind of a solid door to keep out animals that can do tons of damage. Even if it`s a temporary door.  I rented a log cabin for about a year. It had a massive stone fireplace, a loft on each end with an arched bridge connecting the two that was made of curved cedar. It was cool experience. Take care
I miss your dad. I have enjoyed watching the cabin build and your dad working with you in all types of weather. I know your dad is going to be proud from above when all completed. Keep doing the good things you do. Your quality content is appreciated. Blessings from Groton/New London, Connecticut. USA.
Run a metal cable up high to a tree an your solar panels so thd wind wan blow it off them blocks
16]00 video very good
Nice ASMR from the storm.
Dad is missing here in hell. This earth was cursed by God from the apple incident, which turned it into to literal hell. But just imagine the glory of resurrection day, when you see dad again. Don't look backwards into hell, love The Lord and your family and when we join God we will all be family, if you don't mind, can I give you a hug in Zion, my brother, I love your channel and your Christian heart. Amen.
great drone shots
Beautiful floor and craftsmanship. Do miss your father. How proud of you he must be overlooking you. Love those pennies.
Greetings from New Orleans. I see your Dad in you. What a legacy you have to pass on. “May the Peace of God rule in your heart”.
Beautiful work..
Sure miss senior outsider. I know how empty things may seem with out a loved one that is gone I have watched your channel for the whole journey Hope to see it to the finish. I wonder what will come after the cabin is complete Keep us in suspense .
Looks awesome!
Shaded panels are not good..
I love your cabin!  Every thought you have put into it is amazing.  I have not heard of a copper coin inlay except in bathrooms.  It looks great on the floors also.  God bless you and your family.
I lost my mother and father and I can only admire your strength my friend. They say that a boy becomes a man when he loses his father but you became a man before that. I pray for you, your wife, your daughter, your grandfather and all the beautiful Outsider fans! Peace be with you. 🙏🙏🙏
I hope you mark where your conduit is ...Because you are laying it shallow...12'' minimum even in the out back country..oh well!!
My vote is lay the conduit on the ground and bury it, rather than digging.
The cabin is looking amazing and all your and Outsider Snr's hard work is paying off. I cannot believe the progress you are making. Everyday you work on this is one day closer to completion. Keep up the great work and I look forward to the next video.   P.s. Outsider Snr may not be there physically but he is there within you, your hard work and all your memories. Never forget that.✌❤😊
As always another very enjoyable and anticipated video ! Anyone that has followed your channel for any length of time knows the love as well as enjoyment you put into all of your videos  ! Luckily I found and subscribed to your channel in its infancy and what a pleasure it’s been following along with your adventures ! The absence of senior Outsider and your relationship is ever present in my mind even randomly during my day to day. Much love from Maine. Take care my friend !
Everything looks great except for one thing... where is you mask! I know, I know the sawdust doesn't bother you... it will someday! Ask me how I know???
SHALOM... SO GREAT TO SEE Y'ALL'S CHANNEL TODAY FROM BLOODY HARLAN KY.  BLESS U AND FAMILY.  NICE JOB ON THE CABIN BUILD....WOW... THIS IS THE GREATEST ENTERTAINMENTING SHOW ON YOUTUBE.  🛡🇺🇸🌟📜🌟🇺🇸🛡
May the Lord God bless you and your family.
May i ask why not put your solar panel.on top.of your roof?
Beautiful Cabin...
You are truly are an inspiration to us all!!!
It’s amazing to look back and see how far you’ve come along. I love the penny idea. I love following your progress. I know it’s too late but, got an old chainsaw chain. Use that on your chainsaw to dig a trench. Are you going to build a small kitchen @back of cabin?
Sad watching you working by yourself. I'm sure he's watching over you. Hopefully you finish it this year for the coming holidays.
By next year, you will be replacing these batteries with LiFePO4 chemistry and put them inside right under the inverter.  Lead acids batteries are horrible. You'll see what I mean.  The cabin looks nice and bright.
I trust the boards are well-seasoned, lest they shrink in time.
Don't know if it's in the plans but a mud room/ utility room off the back of the cabin would be nice! Grey job on the floor!!!
Your father would be very proud and rightly so great work in a stunning place 😎👊👍
glad to see you back at it. losing a parent is tough but they would want you to see thru to your dreams
You should always put a dig tape atop of your conduit before backfilling... maybe you can cover the ditch with stones or gravel to remind you to be cautious when digging in that vicinity... Godspeed...
I love how it’s turning out. You are doing a super good job on it and your dad would be very proud of your hard work.
🇳🇴👍👍👌
Lame!!!
It's so wild that you picked that particular shot, I think that was the first episode I watched, so it feels particularly like a retrospective for me.
You could easily run screw in anchors, like used for swing sets, and short cables to anchor your solar array.  This would more than handle the bit of wind you might encounter and not require totally re-doing your solar mounts.
pennies? you are trampling on her majestys face? must be a democrat ;)

It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
Nice cabin you built. With the cost of wood I know you had to go with the cheapest wood for the floor but pine is a soft wood that will dent easily
As a retired builder I have to point out some important errors in your flooring installation.   When floors are installed, they are nailed on one side only, the tongue, to allow for wood movement.  In a room this size there should also be a half inch gap by the walls and not tight to the walls.  The gap is then covered with baseboard.  Also the choice of pine.  Pine was used in older homes when pine trees grew to four feet diameters.  The heartwood was harder.  They don't let trees grow that big anymore.  I'd suggest OSMO wood finish, available at Lee Valley,  It has hard waxes that penetrate and can be reapplied  anytime with a bit of cleaning and light sanding.
Just hang sand bags at the base as a precautionary!!!
Know your dad is missed by those of us watching for many years as well. ❤️💜❤️ Many blessings. Great job on the flooring btw.
Coolest cabin build ever!
God bless u and your family.  I know how much u miss your dad.  I still miss mine and he has been gone for many years.
the opening can allow an occasional dip of wind to grab the panels
Мне всё здесь нравится, просто супер!
Hi from sweden sir
Consider putting your inverter/controller up and out of site in the loft, it certainly takes away from the natural rustic look of the cabin. Hopefully you can monitor with bluetooth or a smaller remote display.
Your cabin is a WORK of ART!  Love it!  Continue!   I enjoyed a similar project, working with my late Dad (1910-1975).  I am now aged to 70.
ANOTHER GREAT JOB!!! GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY...
Sr. Outsider is seen in every inch of that cabin. His quiet presence is so missed. The cabin looks amazing
Always enjoy your content. Thanks for sharing. If you see this could you please tell me what moisture content that you recommend for the lumber used for the flooring. I have a lot of hardwood I had milled and would like to do something similar . Thank you.
Floor looks amazing.  Such a great tribute to Sr Outsider.  He will always be with you in your memories.  The Lord provides.

nice to see you, at it. again, big " chok dee " from, SW Thailand.
It may be a Janky solution but you could anchor your solar array to the surrounding trees with steel braided cable.

New dream unlocked: build a cabin in the woods for myself
I really enjoy the whole cabin build series,but what I notice greatly is the good condition the woodlot is in.I can see that that woodlot was never overcut and abused and looks to have served you guys for several generations.I bet the wildlife are even happy.I would love to here about some history of this woodlot.
I love the coin inlays..but be careful, u could stick a $100,000 coin in the floor
My fellow craftsman. I’ve been watching from the beginning. Very sorry about your father. Your an unbelievably gifted carpenter and cabin builder. You and you dad have constructed such a gem. I’ve never felt compelled to comment. I’m hesitant now. But, I’m an electrician. After seeing the feeds coming into your control panel from the array and generator. I felt compelled. Please Sir, run those into that panel with conduit. That DC feed from the array clamped under a metal connector is particularly concerning. Just trying to help. Blessings
cabin looks awesome your dad is looking down and smiling
I always enjoy your videos; and I envy you your beautiful place in the wilderness!  I can almost feel the peace of it here.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us.
Love your work.  Another great video. Take care.
Your narration voice is made for movies. You have a great voice, and listening to it on your videos is really Kool. Cabin is looking fantastic. I miss your dad, 😔 I'm sure he taught you a lot of things you know today. Flooring looks amazing.
The floor and cabin are looking great! Excited for the interior build 👌
Dad is always with you, there is nothing missing.
No expansion gaps on your floor 😬
It's almost a shame to put walls up inside the cabin that will take away from the inside view.  I like the open look.
😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈✨😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈✨😈😈🌟
I know where to go when I need to let all my anxiety and frustration out..
Don't worry I'll bring my hammer and drive the golden nail right on the head
Thank you. was waiting for this from your last video, although it took a while.
👍🏻👍🏻 Outsider.  Looking forward to seeing more videos.  Stay safe and God Bless Y'all 🙏🏻✌🏻❤😊

This is the first video I have seen of your's and it is fantastic, you do excellent work. You have a calmness about you, that is rare these days. I always enjoy seeing a person using the talent God gave them. I subscribed and  prayed for you and your family. I look forward to more videos.
I watch Sr, Outsider twice..and i was so sad to know his gone..
Can you please please build the porch or at least a set of stairs?    Where do you drink your beers when finished for the day?
Are you worried about the cold temperatures in the wintertime on the batteries? I thought I read somewhere that was bad for them.
Great to see the progress... have missed seeing you (but I do understand). The power supply and solar panels have added some modern technology to your build. Floor looks great and will look even better when you have finished it with the protective coats. Look after yourself and God bless you and your family.
Looking nice and safe and very functional. I might see your Dad before you do! My Dad also awaits! Ron PTL USA
Make a front door deck with stone stairway.
how nice to be all warm and dry inside the cabin doing the flooring while its raining cats and dogs outside.
Glad to see you plugging along. This is your year of firsts with out him. But hes there in your efforts
Wondered about u earlier in week and their u r....soon the snow will fly..
I would be concerned about having a bunch of flammable lithium batteries stored under a flammable wood cabin.  I would think it would be better to have the batteries away from the house in a weather proof shed.  I would also hope that you are planning to bury your solar cable conduit later to a proper depth, at least 18" if not deeper with caution tape above the conduit.
Hello Outsider you have done an amazing job on your cabin and I sure am happy to have watched you build it from the beginning. You and your family have come a long way on that cabin, especially you. You have put your heart and soul into that cabin and I can't wait for the finished product. May God keep blessing you Outsider.
Thanks incredible video my friend Can't wait to see the next one😀 NC
The floors look spectacular. Your father is watching you from heaven with pride and love… Don’t ever forget that
Sharing these videos with you is a real blessing.  I feel your fathers spirit and  presence with you, in every video.  You are your fathers son, his greatest legacy of all time and the cabin is a memorial to the legacy to that which you and your father shared and built together.  What an incredible and amazing gift.  Maybe you could  build a framed rustic plaque with a shilacked photo of you and your father together - and put it on a wall, when you have some free time.   Thank you for sharing your legacy.  It means so much to us.
Are you going to stain the flooring. I can't wait to see what you do with the entry stairs. Cabin looks awesome.
Your emotional strength is incredible. Under absolute unimaginable loss and pain, you continue to push forward just like your father would want. I don’t want to pretend to know what you’re dealing with but can only imagine. God bless, you.
to the simple life
Winter is coming, best select another gear. Enjoyed it even if a tad kurz. Bis zum nächsten Mal
The penny palace
So sad that you lost your father in the middle of this, that can't be an easy hurdle. Looks like you've kept your chin up and kept on though, bravo Mr. Outsider.
What do you call an alligator in a vest?      An in-vest-igator!
this is one of the channels that I look forward to each week! I hope that another project after the cabin is finished. You and your dad did some awesome work. GOD bless.
Yes , it's hard to believe that summer is 2/3 gone. It's August 21st and only one month of summer remains . Actually , one month and 2 days , since summer ends on September 23rd this year , not the 21st .
God bless you young man!
Just a Thought, Why not name the cabin after your Dad or have a memorial stone & plaque near the entrance.
Never know when they stick a bunch of jelly beans in a jar well you should have a contest to see how many pennies it took to do your Loft and your floor the closest one would get a piece of flooring with a Canadian penny in it and your signature I think that would be pretty neat my guess was would be $3.13
He playing MineCraft in real life👾
This cabin will be here till the end of time. Outsider and Outsider Senior really put in the effort to do every step of this build right. So impressed to have been here since the beginning. Awesome content and faith in the build. Perseverance my friend.
God bless you 🙏
I pray for you brother, I sure miss you dad also but we will meet up again
Great job with everything, but it's not the same without your dad.
God bless wonderful work. Keeping you in our prayers love to your family. Desiree New Zealand.
Rent a tiller to soften up the ground then shovel it deeper.  Nice flooring.
Its coming along so awesome . When the video starts you show the front of your cabin all i see and can think of is the front door.  Recalls the video you and your Dad built the door and how  Is impressive just that one part of your journey is god bless thanks for taking us on another part of it .😎👍
The cabin is looking great. Can't wait to see what's to come.
awesome work! hopefully everyone knows not to use simply not safe alarm system because of the microwave radiation they slow poison you with! Keep up the good work, cabin looks perfect.
As you began to work today…. I thought of your dad and the amazing comraderie you shared😊 however  he is with His Father in heaven!
Did you leave an expansion gap against the wall? Thats super important to prevent floor buckling.
Very good video and the floor looks great!
Awesome video, good job man, I Really enjoyed watching it.
Truly amazing how much you have accomplished love the cabin man.
Senior Outsider is still so present in these videos. I can see his work all over the cabin, I can hear the immense amount of love and pain of him missing in your voice, still so sorry for your loss but incredibly thankful for your content.
Your front door is so beautiful so as the floors… you are so skilled! Congratulations
Hola primero que nada;quiero decir lo mucho que lamento la partida de tu padre 😢😢 no ahí palabras que llenen ese vacío que el dejo en ti, pero al momento que planearon hacer esa cabaña 🛖 en cada rincón de ella está un recuerdo de tu padre.. Es una satisfacción el poder hacer cosas con nuestros padres no importa cuál grandes o pequeños sean esos proyectos lo que realmente importa es el tiempo conviviendo con ellos…  No tengo mucho viendo tus vídeos pero desde el primer vídeo me quedé fascinada 😅 todo trabajo que realizas lo hace verse muy fácil 🤪..  sigue adelante y mucha suerte en todos tus proyectos 👍🏽👍🏽 un saludo cordial desde chihuahua México
So enjoy watching this cabin get some more finishing touches. It is so cozy and well made.  It is also filled with so many memories of Outsider Sr.  The legacy of your combined skills will forever stand in this retreat.
Absolutely love this series. God bless.
I love the beauty you add to life and to this cabin.  I am so sorry for your loss.  I can see all the wonderful attributes your father taught you, the best being your faith in God.   I pray you and your family have a blessed day!
it is truly amazing how life can change in a year, both in good and not so good ways. Looking at that footage, it is amazing how far it has come. given you weren't able to have full xmas at the cabin as you desired last year (i am sure we were all hoping you would). assumably -plans are for this year to do that?
We gonna get a back door?
When I the router  I thought to myself not many people know how to do that now a days !!! Did it with all of my  kitchen cupboards and  bedroom sets in the house for children and myself !!! It took a long time but with cherry wood it is worth it from their grandparents  farm that grew up there !!! When I saw you making the holes it pulled into my  mind  PENNIES are going into those now !!!
Hey you are doing amazing job on the cabin.  Glad to see you are doing well.  Anyway take care and have a wonderful week.
Idk why but your episodes seem to fly by regardless of how long they are
Seeing you miss your Dad makes me miss mine as well. I bring up his name often he is not forgotten. You are brave to take your drone up in the wind, but I have done it too with my Dji mini2 as well.
The flooring turned out beautifully!  The cabin is a testament to you and your father's mutual love and respect for each other. Can't wait to see what your vision for the interior will be. The curved beams have my total curiosity. Stay safe and well.
You are da man, so awesome
lt is looking great, take care
I love that you edit it in a way that it's not long and tedious. Yes, it was a shorter video but very engaging ❤️ The cabin looks fantastic!  Missing your dad but I know he's still with you for every step of your journey
You and you Dad do amazing detailed work. Real Canadian Craftsman. The cabin is fabulous.
Another great session. Can't wait for the next one.
Dear Brother, The Bible says we are surrounded by a mighty cloud of witnesses. We don't know exactly what that means but....... I prefer to see (in that cloud) your father there with the Master Carpenter smiling down with pride admiring your good work. You are for sure and for certain a tool that is meet in the Masters hand. Yes you are. May God continue to bless you as you bless us. Amen
Great job.
senior Outsider would be proud of you
I hope your family and you are safe up there anyways I was thinking you can make a stairwell out of those Cedars that are curved in front of your cabin that would look beautiful in there stay safe brother that cabin is looking like a million dollars no thanks to your father I'm sure he's really missed and so is your mother
🙏✝️
I absolutely love this cabin.  It is such a beautiful and relaxing retreat.  I can just imagine how proud your dad would be...you have done well!  I cannot wait for the next episode.  Keep up the amazing work!  I'll be watching from southern Nova Scotia 😁
The flooring looks amazing. Well done!
I know what you mean. I lost my Dad back in 2015
Wow it’s really looking nice! Must have felt really good to get the floor down. Just moved out to my off grid property finally this week. Can’t wait to get my solar up tomorrow. Thanks again for sharing you’re journey and keeping me going in the mean time.
I bet you have very bad output from your solar. That is because it is partially shaded. If ONE cell in a string gets shaded the whole string of the panel quits. Means one shaded cell takes out half of your panel. Cut that trees behind the panels down. They will allways grow branches over that solar.
Ihe cabin is looking so good I wish I could build one like this may be one day but the pennies on the floor is so incredible thank you for all that you do with your videos
listen
Awesome work mate! Bouncing back from tragedy is always hard. But, as my father (who also passed away last year) used to say, “One day, you pull up a chair in the middle of your completed project, and think this is so good!” Stay well
I believe Sr. ( and his wife ) are right there w you. Looking down, watching over, protecting. Warms my heart to watch these. Many thanks…
Very well organized indeed.....!  well done ..!  sad that you are the lone ranger in this episode....
Really nice video. Will your batteries be fine during the cold of the winter?
Hi there, so excited to see a video up today. Wr have missed you. We would like to ask you, where have you got your skills from, we realise your Dad must have taught you a lot but putting the sloan panels etc. the electricity, gas connections?
I'm sorry about your father, May God bless you and yours
Nice floor.  Great job. I have a pine floor in our family room, with big windows to let the outdoors in, with sky lights.
Remove ALL of the branches that could cast shadows onto those panels! Even the shadow of a wool string cast from 2m distance can degrade panel output significantly.
God bless young  man
I think this year's Christmas episode will be one for the ages. A Christmas Eve Livestream would be amazing to say the least
https://youtu.be/4w7da_FcXWQ
Your craftsmanship is absolutely amazing!  I hope you are able to work and enjoy the work you and your father would have been able to do together.
The batteries need to be in a warm environment. Do you have a low temperature cut off for the batteries or do you have an internal heater for them?
Cables?? Dc ?? only asking as Dc doesn't travel far with out big losses
Looking great brother. Pray that your family is doing well. God bless y’all.
LOOKS GREAT 👍 OUTSTANDING THAT FLOOR WILL VEY NICE WHEN YOU GET FINISH GODSPEED TOO YOU!!!!
NEWS FLASH FOR THE SHEEP: Police are NOT "The Authorities"......THEY ARE SERVANTS.....PUBLIC SERVANTS. WAKE UP AND RECOGNIZE HOW YOU HAVE BEEN BRAINWASHED AND YOUR COUNTRY TAKEN OVER VIA THE VAST IGNORANCE OF THE SHEEP.
Your dad would be proud of you stalwartly continuing the legacy you both worked on.,.
👍🏻
God Bless You Sweetie. So sorry, for the loss of your father.
Did you mill and dry the floor boards?
Almost surreal experience!
You are one amazing guy what you and your dad have done is absolutely amazing sorry to hear about your dad god bless you and your family
Nice floor!!
Canadian pennies or US pennies🤔
Looks ,,   Beautiful  . .  What a great job you are doing ..
God bless you  beatiful work at the cabin.🇵🇷
I can’t believe how much difference the floor makes. Every thing you do now is because your dad passed on that knowledge and he is there with every beat of your heart. Did you decide on the old wagon wheel?
Just beautiful as always!!!!
Hey Brother. I tried to buy Simplisafe but I can’t find out how to buy for Canadians. Any help would be great.
God bless you, you've done well.  Keep your chin up your Dads watching over you. God bless him R.I.P
Glad to see you back brother, it’s exactly how the “Plaid Hero” would have wanted you! Bless you friend.
That thunderstorm drone shot was amazing ❤️
The floor is going to be stunning.  Your craftsmanship is beautiful.  Sending prayers.
Looking good
Good job burying that conduit 1/4" deep...
My back and it's three surgical repairs keens at the sight of digging that trench. That said, our local rent-a-center rents gas powered trencher/diggers for $50/day and would have been, in my opinion, worth the expense to spare your back.
We are so happy to see the stage the cabin is at, at this time. We have been there during the lockdowns and even as we mourned and cried at the loss of our own family members, we also mourned the death of Senior Outsider. He helped to do the roof, the chinking and was always there, I am sure, for advice. The past two years were his goodbye to all of us and salute him and the Outsider family who have been so inspirational. May God continue to be a blessings to the family!
What a journey it has been and the amazing thing is that Outside Senior was there long enough in the process to help do the big jobs best done with someone and where safety would be a big issue. God knew that you needed him then and only when you came back down to ground level, he went to his eternal, heavenly resting place, having blessed not just you with his welcome presence, but has been a blessing to all of us, even down here in South Africa. Thank you Outsiders!
Ship lap is more expensive than most people can fathom. It's actually kinda ironic when a wood cabin is the definition of absolute luxury and cost. I'm sure Abe Lincoln didn't feel that way. Now we got half million dollar stick piles. It's so deflating that Canada made the lumber industry unobtanium
not advisable to have a long line of electric wire from array to inverter.
Your careful workmanship and dedication to your family cabin is inspirational to watch. Thanks for sharing! From Utah!
I use a pick as you do for such work but add a single bit axe I don't mind dulling for cutting roots.
I know the lingering effects of losing your father all too well. I lost my developmentally disabled brother at the Beginning of the year. He used too, and my son still does watch the growth of this cabin with me from its inception. I know that you father, and mother also are looking down on you with approving eyes, and that you will raise your child with stories of what you and your father have done here. Always remember, he may be gone, but nothing can take away what you two shared together. God Bless.
The cabin looks great. Sr Outsider would be proud.
Pine seems like a bad choice for flooring
Good job on the flooring.
I am so glad you continue to share your journeys with us, thank you.
That cabin is turning out to be a masterpiece 👌
I love the penny idea looks better than caps on the screws
Hello Mr Outsider I have watched all your videos from the beginning and I've enjoyed your journey good and bad times. You make the videos really interesting and informative. I love all your family and pray for you all and I pray the cabin will carry on giving you joy as it's given us viewers. Bless you and your family, I really love the cabin its looking fabulous well done. God bless take care from Amanda from Scotland UK xx
Love your videos!!! Have you thought about cleaning the pennies before you lay them in? Soaking them in tomato juice, and using a little salt to scrub them with a toothbrush will make them bright again!
Outsider, The old saying a "penny for your thoughts" now reflects the countless daily thoughts you will always  have about your father and what you two have accomplished. Great video. I greatly appreciate your editing skills that show us your process without dwelling on each stage. Well done, my friend.
Another great video and the cabin looks GREAT. Still not used to not seeing your Dad working with you in the videos. God Bless you and the family.
For the Array? Poor a slab.. That should be enough weight to anchor it in place, plus you mentioned a shower.. add a drain and maybe some radiant heat (electric) coils to the floor.. Maybe not the radiant heat but definitely a slab vs pier footings. All I can add regarding the floor.. Is consider an oil finish or and oil based varnish vs a poly for longevity, and maintenance vs a water based product.
You did a good job.
Nothing short of amazing! I miss your dad too. Blessings to your family
i was just wondering about you and your project yesterday, and here's the update! great as always thanks
was the virus c.o.d?
thank you so much
This cabin will be beautiful when it's done thank you for sharing this step by step with everyone.
How much impact abuse can the solar panels withstand without being damaged?
I love watching you build this cabin, your craftsmanship and planning is exceptional.
YOUR DAD HAS LEFT A MARK THAT WIND & RAIN & SUN CANNOT ERASE...WHAT HE HAS PASSED ON TO YOU, WILL REMAIN WITH YOU FOR AS LONG AS YOU LIVE...HIS LOVE ETCHED IN EVERY CORNER OF YOUR CABIN, FROM HAMMERED NAILS TO TIN SHEATHING ON THE ROOF, FROM THE VERY FOUNDATION TO THE CHINKING BETWEEN THE LOGS...REST IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HE HAS NEVER LEFT YOUR SIDE...GOD BLESS YOU & YOUR FAMILY...🙏;)
Your dad would be so proud of you finishing the cabin build.  If the Queen knew she was decorating the cabin floor - she would be proud too.  God Bless!!!
I love the pennies!
There are only a couple of channels that I wat h on cabin build and its you and Shawn James from My Self Reliance. You are both incredible builders and have been learning so much from both of you. Thank you.
That was very smart to precut and fit all the flooring boards before screwing them in place, rather than one board at a time. And worked out great with that storm coming in. : ) Love the pennies!
During this last winter season .. we had our entire house covered with metal sheeting.  All the metal was screwed down through the peaks .. not the valleys.  I know that's not the way you did it .. bc of second-hand sheeting .. but what I read in the comments confirmed for me that it was the right way to do it.  Seeing your dad gone .. is such a sad reminder of how short our lives are.  Everything should be done with care and great foresight.  Thanks for another great video episode!
Your father's legacy is _you,_ Outsider, who blesses the world in God's Name.
And another good video bites the dust. It's good to see your shining face again. The floor is going to look great.
The Cables You Are Burring . What Gage are They For 110 Feet? Need To Know!  BTW.   GREAT Videos!!!! Subbed To Your Channel Since The Beginning!! Wonderful Job!!!
Need a covered porch for the rainy times.
SimpliSafe The most unsecure system on the market.....
Welcome back. Love watching your creativity as you build your cabin. Is it going to be your retirement home?
Great Job It looks fantastic
👋😎👍
This log cabin is the best I’ve seen
May God Bless y'all always. I look and see your Dad through all the work his hands and your's have done. 🙏🙏🙏❤️
You might find Tech Ingredients video on how to make your solar panels more efficient interesting.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FKhszB4E1_M
I too had a hard time getting through this.  It’s obvious the skills were passed on.  Curious about the two arced trees, some sort of remembrance to your Dad, maybe???
👍👍
It's coming along beautifully!
Regarding trench-digging in excessively rocky ground, folks:  If you can't dig down, you can always mound up!  This does leave you with a bit of a berm to deal with, but you can pile on and tamp down more dirt to extend the slopes into something more gradual and less noticeable.  If you're moving heavy machinery over these berms, you can bury some of those rocks on either side of the pipeline along with lengthy pieces across it, braced from rock to rock, before packing on the dirt.  If you do't have to worry about crossing the line, another possibility is building a drystone wall over/around the conduit, especially if you're trying to clear rocks from a field for future planting.  A third might be to build a wattle-woven fence, though that would be a bit more difficult to weave.
I see your Dad in every episode, he is with you.   You are one heck man, nice job on everything you do.  The cabin is absolutely stunning and your detail work second to none.
Lovely episode, such a hard working, humble man. I could listen to your calming voice for an age. God bless you and your Family xx 🇬🇧👌
It's been a year since my own father passed away.  I wish we'd had a project like yours, to rewatch and revisit and remember.  But he and I did make good memories over the years.  And a lot of us really appreciate you having shared your memories of your father with us.  Thank you.  May everything you learned from him continue to make you an even better father and husband yourself, and may many of us learn to be better from his examples, too.
As a old carpenter I like the way you put the floor down , only thing is you need to leave a gap at least 1/4” along walls to prevent the boards from heaving and warping on you from shrinking and expanding. Your dad is right there watching you and in your thoughts.
Remarkable that you have so much knowledge and skill to do all of this work while you are young enough to execute it all on your own.  It's a testament to your Dad and the kind of father he was.
Looking real snazzy my friend. Thanks for the content. Always look forward to your videos.
Always enjoy your videos. I see you have over 1 million subscribers congratulations to that. The cabin is absolutely stunning your Dad would be so proud of you. Much love from Texas.
Just a thought, you might want to mark where you have buried cables, in case you have to dig at a later date.... I`m sure you Dad is there in spirit and will let you know at some point....
I am truly sorry about your dad, but as a dad I know he is so proud of you and your continued hard and persistent work , great job , your channel was the first cabin build channel I ever watched on YouTube and the bond you and your dad have is evident.God Bless!
Nice to see the progress on the Outsider family cabin. Bet that wasn’t fun digging that trench. Well worth all the effort in the end.
I love that the story continues. Still lifting up your wife and family in prayer.
What about the back door that's just a plastic sheet next to the power pak
Love you and Angel Dad 🙏😘💖
Just Beautiful.
As always, great to see a video from you upon my arrival home today. Love the cabin floor. Looks great. Thanks for sharing. Till next time, peace to you and your family.
❤❤❤
Wunderschön, Umweltfreundlich und einfach fantastisch!,!!!👌👍❤
What brand is that left handed circle saw? most  saws have the dust gaurd on the right side ? I'm left handed.
The floor is absolutely stunning excellent work my friend, I know hard it is losing parents it's been 12 years for my mother and 9 years for my dad and it still feels like yesterday. But with the faith in the lord and family and friends for support. Take care my friend stay safe and God bless. I still have your wife in my thoughts and prayers.
Good job
Good to see you back again. Lovely cabin. God bless.
Your cabin is looking awesome. Your Dad would be so proud of you. We really like watching your videos from Scotland. Take care :)
I really like the floor it is looking very good can't wait to see it all done and May God Bless you and your family.
More great work and a professional video presentation. I miss your Dad, so I know you must be missing him terribly. You are doing a fantastic job. Best Wishes  Pete (Manchester UK).
🙏
God bless you too
Been watching you since about day one, so I feel kindof like a distant relative when I say this. Hes not missing hon, hes right there beside you, patting you on the back! Hes in every inch of that cabin, just as you are! And Im pretty sure he flew into your moms arms when he crossed over! Hes at peace, find yours. He wouldnt want you to be sad, when hes so happy! 😍😁 I know its sooo hard! ✌🏼🤟🏻💜 always sending love and peace.
I am excited to see you build it out too!  I miss your dad as well brother!
Hello again my friend, Great Posting, Dad is out of sight but not out of our minds, miss him greatly, hope your wife is doing much better now, you are amazing, inspirational, motivating and set guidelines for others to follow,  God's Good Blessings to you and your beautiful family keep up the great work love U guys XOXOXO stay safe and healthy 🇨🇦❤👍
Good to see you back at it nice job
You could anchor it like one does a trailer.   Cables and screw anchors in ground.   Enough to hold.
Mr. Outsider,  You and I are a lot alike in that our Dad's and us look similar enough that I swear I see both of you in these episodes between your mannerisms and personality.     The cabin I looking so awesome I wish I could see it in person. Keep up tit great work sir.
I ordered a simply safe system and I hope they give you some credit for it.
it's so sad your father won't see it finished after all the hard work he put into it
What about  frost heave   pushing the conduit   to the surface in  winter time ?
I was hoping you would include the coins like you did in the loft. Absolutely  makes the flooring POP!
I’m late but the House is looking Awesome Outsider ! 😁👍
Brought a smile to my face seeing Sr. Outsider again. Still hurts to think we'll never see him on the videos again. However, you got to have many years with a great dad, sometimes we just have to look at the positives.
I agree totally! The two of you had a beautiful relationship!
The flooring looks great, wonderful job but then everything you do looks fantastic.  I understand the "one thing missing", as you've been working I think about your dad and know he's watching over you and he's there in spirit.  Stay safe, be careful, take it easy and keep dry and cool.
Do you think you will ever have a screened in porch for all those biting bugs.....
Great work!
Thanks for including the flashbacks.  We also are remembering with great fondness and tenderness the presence of your Dad in every aspect of the whole cabin build.  As well, I'm sure you are grateful for being able to create your own flooring with these wide and long boards.  It's really looking wonderful.
That flooring is beautiful!
I am very happy to see you and to watch another episode of the construction of your cabin we are always close to you with affection and friendship a warm greeting from the "hot" Sicily Italy Fabrizio
Love you kiddo ❤🙏🏾
The floor is going to look so awesome when your done, that penny lay idea is very cool!
Hi jr outsider  I so enjoy your videos and I too miss your dad very much so I do feel for you. He is watching over you. Looking forward to your next video. Love from stefania from South Africa.
The flooring looks awesome. Mr Sr Outsider is proud as he watches down on you completing the cabin. Your workmanship is great. Thanks for sharing with us through your videos.
1.04 Million Subs . Congratulations !
Hello to you
Those inlays look really good! Well done 👍🏻 My only question is, are you concerned about denting in the pine floor from heavy objects? 🤔. Just a thought for an addition to the floor, maybe use the router to add your  families names around the stove and fill with a coloured epoxy before finishing the floor coating.
looking pretty good.  I'm wondering about laying the flooring all the way to the wall as you did though.  Flooring expands side to side quite a bit.  Pine is not as bad as say Maple, but it does expand.  I laid a maple floor and had to be pretty careful.  came out ok.  But when I laid a beech floor, I was really careful, leaving a space below the rock AND the baseboard, so a full inch on each side of a room.  I tried to let the flooring adjust to the local humidity too, (the flooring was a bit TOO dry).  But in truth, it wasn't enough.  All the flooring "cupped" a bit because of the pressure.  I've seen quite a few such floors.  It will be cupped until I have it re-sanded someday...  I've heard of walls being pushed off their foundations by such floors, but obviously that won't happen here.  I know baseboards would not really be very easy for you in your situation either.
Excelent work with the floor. And the back door? Don't you think it's unsafe to have the house with or behind the back door so unprotected?
Beautiful build!  Your Dad’s presence will always be with you.
I felt like I needed eye protection myself with the up close shot of the router cutting the ship lap - awesome shot.  Love the look of the floor and Penny inlay!  Thank you for the education on solar, batteries and charging.  Looking forward to seeing the floor finished.  God Bless!
Slowly but surely things are coming along. 👍😍
Like the year ago photo, compared to now,yours and your father's hard work created this beautiful dream cabin,I'm so happy to see u installing the flooring, knowing your father's with tall the way. Definitely one of the most well built cabins I've seen.
Thank you so much for making these videos. You are touching so many lives with your hard work and in the honoring your father. I usually find myself in tears when watching because your attitude is so uplifting.
It's so nice to see you back at it, love the cabin it's looking really great, God bless you and yours...
Short but powerful. God bless \
Make sure the batteries don’t get to cold in the winter time it could kill them love all the work y’all have put into the house
Im so glad to see you working on the cabin again.  I know you and your father were so close.  You miss him terribly , I'm sure. You guys were a good teem!  Finishing this cabin and having a happy life in it is one of the best ways to salute him.  It's good to see you back!  ❤
You are magic and such a perfectionist. Thks for sharing. You are blessed, as you should be with wonderful Dad memories, Hes watching.....
Nice to see you back at it
When you go out to your cabin you do a lot of work you might not be all on the video but that's a lot of work
that's an impressive cabin
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC JOB. WE ALL MISS YOUR DAD‼️🙏❤️ Vinny 🇺🇸
Just so impressive, top quality work, your dad taught you well. Curious if you considered using non toxic alternative to polyurethane. Linseed oil etc? In staying with healthier methods of living in the forest. I know it will come out spectacular! 👍🙏🪵
looking good
Where's Daddy
(English) Do you know this truth?  1. The clouds of the sky from all over the world are  coming down to the earth more and more every day.  2. The sun and moon in the sky are super moon and  super sun every day.  3. If you look closely at the sunrise and sunset,  you can see the pink sky.  4. The chemical components of Chemtrail are spraying  like crazy in the sky around the world.  5. If you look closely at the moon now, the moon is rotating.  Yeshua is coming very soon.   - Yeshua Coming -
Hi
Thanks Young man... always nice to see you ... yep.. we miss your Dad too....  but we know where we came from and where we're going... thanks Jesus... Great work on the floor.... really going to shine ! ... God bless you and the missus .
👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Wow. A years time has flown by. And so much progress with a home that will be here for many years to come. Have you considered some fire protection for it? Hope your wife and the rest of your family is well. It has been a blessing to watch and see your dream come to life. Take care and God Bless you.
Great video as allways,  loved the drone footage of the storm.
These are very satisfying, calming videos to watch
That is a seriously beautiful floor! Good job. Loved the drone shots of the storm. I do miss seeing your dad but you made the best of your time together and his handiwork is everywhere to comfort you and your family. 👍😎🇨🇦🌲💘 P.S. may your batteries always be happy!
Could you use the anchors and metal straps that are used to anchor mobile homes? Many hold up to hurricane Andrew 's Standards in Florida.
Your father taught you well, may he look down on you and your family with pride for a job well done.   On the solar panel frame, could you use screw in anchors and tie-in with a couple of cables?  Don't know if the ground is too rocky.  Keep up the great work.
THE CABIN IS LOOKING BEAUTIFUL.  GREAT JOB. I KNOW YOUR FATHER IS LOOKING DOWN ON YOU. HE WAS SUCH A PART OF THE CABIN. HE WILL LIVE ON WITH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY😘😇💕 MAY THE LORD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.
I think I would have done the trench in six or tenfold sections to make easier on me!
Someone has to say it . . The power pack itself plus it’s location sucks a lot of the beauty out of the cabin.  I am and I will remain an admirer of all that you and your Dad have brought to the build but, man, you’ve got to hide that thing!
The cabin is looking amazing - can’t wait to see the interior being completed.
Какой это дом? Какая это дача?? ЭТО МУЗЕЙ СТРОИТЕЛЬНОГО ИССКУСТВА И ЭСТЕТИКИ... Браво!
It's been wonderful seeing this cabin come together so beautifully.
Since the sun doesn't shine alot during winter months. Why not install some smaller wind turbine. To compensate for low sunshine. As you stated, the wind blows very high in winter months
U're dad will be proud of you ,bro
Great video as always. Your mom and dad are looking down proud. Curious what your plan is for a back door before winter settles in. Same idea as the main front door?  Be safe and thanks.
You have built a lifetime of memories into that cabin. Your videos will pass those memories down for Generations. Blessings to you and your family.
You and your pops have a eye for details good job
It's sad the old man can't see how well it's turning out, but with the amount of care and attention he invested, you'll be in his presence every time you set foot here.
+
Looks awesome, next time make a jig so you don't have to measure each hole
It's funny how much bigger the interior looks with the flooring down. It's truly a labour of love. Looking forward to the build out. Thank you for sharing.
Howdy brother- I love the floor!  Wonderful job on everything. Take care and God’s blessings to y’all
Looking good !!!!
I bet my Mother has enjoyed the story about the cabin, your Father tells up in Heaven.....
LOOKING GREAT,  SEE YOU NEXT TIME...
shouldnt you move the batteries from under the cabin due to a fire risk? maybe place them in a steel box for fire protection
💪💪💪
Brother aren't you living in that cabin yet?
Sr. Outsider is in every timber he touched, every fastener he put in, every drop of sweat, every exhalation and effort. He will always be there with you.
Beautiful floor and workmanship all around.
Do you have any plans to build a nice wooden box enclosure around the power pack? Just to hide it a bit and blend it in.
Hi, so glad you are continuing with the build. The Flooring is looking great and do is all of the Cabin. It is beautiful and I shall be looking forward to your working the inside if it. Your Father will be so happy at you Progress. God Bless and stay safe
The cabin is looking really great! Your family will love moving into it! I know your Dad is watching over every new build and he's just as impressed as I am with your hainiwork. God bless you and keep posting!
You could use big cork screw steel and straps like a mobile hand me to secure it
When are you getting a backdoor?
Porcupine love solar PV wire. Only cost me $240.00 to find that out first hand.
The cabin is just beautiful! Thank you!
So glad to see you again....yours was the first show I saw on building...haven't missed a program.....thank you so much for all you've helped me learrn. God bless you & your family. Miss your dad too.....
Your log cabin is very beautiful. You have put a lot of hard work into building it. I am loving all the videos you put on youtube.
I do still love to watch these and at times go back and watch the earlier ones too, Hows the wife and her health, going for now, Later
Beautiful work.
Miss your dad. He was my age.
I still feel the presence of Sr. Outsider.  He is still with up and in the cabin.  Next, the storm @ about 4:56 was beautiful.  Your story telling through photography/videography is has matured by leaps and bounds.  Simply outstanding!
It is truly special to see how far the channel has come. From not hardly seeing your face to finally hearing your explanations and even your poetic thoughts about the back country you call home.
Can’t wait see how you use those curved sticks  I’m hoping it’s railing of some sort 😁
Wow your doing such a great job God bless young man!
Your cabin is a work of art.
sharp
I love your house. You do everything perfectly. Congrats! 👏👏👏👏
Amazing!
The solar electric system looks like it will work wonderfully! Love watching your videos!
You hawe a golden hands, knowing how to do all that...king!! Greetings from Croatia 🇭🇷 😀
So glad your Dad is in so many of the videos, Enjoy going back and watching the two of you working together. Did your Dad have a sence of humor? Just wondering. My Condolences again, I know you miss him so much. My dad was my best friend. He taught me how to build and work with my hands. He didn't try to hold me back from learning what I wanted because I was female like most of his generation. He passed away in 2004 and I still think of him almost every day.
You may want to consider waiting on putting down the finish on the flooring until after you have interior walls framed, just so you don't scuff up the pretty new finish!  I have to admit that I'm the lazy sort, I'd have gone to a tool rental place and SOMEHOW gotten a "ditch witch" or something similar on-site to dig that trench a little bit deeper.
An open floor plan seems better than dividing that space up. Wardrobe cabinets for clothes. Kitchen cabinets along an exterior wall. The only private walled area would be a bathroom area.
just amazing solar power he makes repairs to wires means electric and flooring wood with pennies that's a cool  great job 😊👌🙌👍
God bless you
Thank you 🙏 🙂
Great episode.  The cabin looks amazing!  What do you have planned for the back door?  Something like the front door?
Your dad will be very proud of you completing the cabin.
Not worry about wood expansion?
The little insert of your Dad pulled at my heart strings. I miss him a LOT as I'm sure you miss him twice as much. LUV TO ALL YOUR FAMILY and looking 4ward to seeing your future cabin build and to see how you decorate it. 🙂🙂🙂🥰🥰🥰👍👍
Should be able to spend Christmas there this year.
chains and guy wire anchors
I’m quite familiar with trenching to bury cable at the cabin. Just to install a yard light we dug a 50 ft trench to below the frost line in sandy soil. Lots of rocks and roots impeded our job, but a backhoe and tree loppers sure helped! That was almost 50 years ago, and it’s still in working order.
As always, an excellent video. Just realized that the peaks of the roof when viewed from above form a cross. It brought a smile to my face. Continue your good work.
As the old saying goes..."gone but not forgotten". He is everywhere in this cabin and he is proud of your hard work. Take it from another Dad proud of his son who works hard and keeps his nose to the grindstone. Greetings from Texas....John B
Watching you with your father these past years... 🌲🌳🏞is like eye am there🧚‍♂to see you continue at your own pace🪵🏕🏚 is much appreciated!  💚luv the flooring penny design!🦓Sandra from Montreal.  🦊 @Fairland Well Said!!
Good job ,Beautiful plancher  !!!!!!
The floor looks incredible, as does the whole cabin. So nice to have the reminders of your dad all over the cabin.
Your Dad would be so proud.
I was like.... Please us the Pennies again....   So pleased.  It will look spectacular
your father would be so proud with the work you are doing
Magnificent. Thanks for sharing your adventure.
I know what you are thinking often and who you are hearing in your head while doing this project.
Is that battery box insulated enough? Freeze them and it won't matter how you try and fill them...
Great job 😘👍🏻💕
That is a beautiful cabin. It would be kinda cool to cut out a slot on one of the log walls, and put your dad's hammer in it, after burning his name date of birth and death. And plexiglass front it. He'd like that.
It would be way easier to take a little piece of board or even cardboard for that matter and make those three little marks that you're making to screw the boards down as a template instead of using your damn tape measure every single time
It's coming together nicely. Ever think of an epoxy over the flooring vs a poly?
I watched your videos when you were cutting your logs and your tractor broke down. Three  or four years ago was the last time i saw your videos. The cabin is cool but figured it would be done by know. I guess Rome wasn’t built in a day.
Wow! The cabin is looking so beautiful!
put a bunch of rocks on the base of the solar frame.
❤❤❤❤
Brilliant work
Good job keep it going
Marvellous work my friend.
Your doing such a good job on the cabin. I know your Dad would be proud!
'I've become a fan. Beautiful work.  What have you done in the way of fire prevention and protection?
Beautiful cabin! Amazing work! 👏
by pouring clear resin on pennies may prevent it from dust build up.
God bless you too Mr. Outsider!
As usual. excellent video.
You both did a gorgous cabine,and nice to see him with you again .
Your father is watching over you
Nice job! The floor looks great.
such a beautiful build
we miss your father as well.
Hi, I see that you are holding up and persevering!  Keep going with the build and you, your family and your dad will be proud.  Such a great job!  Thanks for making this video my friend!
Nice work,  if you are able,  put a small walking type path right beside the buried cable.  So when years go by you dont. Forget exactly where that cable is.  👍👍✌✌🙏🙏
Mr. Outsider, I thank you for all your knowledge sharing.  I love watching How To videos.  You have a knack to teach us the details that are often missing in other videos.  (from Nipissing district)
Why not bring in a small backhoe ? Let’s hope it’s deep enough?  You will always have the memories. And most of all these videos of your father. You will be missed. Thank you for these videos
I know you miss your dad and I can see a lot of him in that cabin that the two of you built and his memory will always be in that cabin with you and I know he is looking down and enjoying watching you finish the cabin.
Your Dad is cheering you on….he will be there for the dedication!
Love the penny inlays 🤗
It was an amazing journey watch how you build this beautiful cabin,really learn watching,was very sad when know your father passed away,but really leave giving us an achieve of knowledge,congratulations for those amazing videos👍👍👍👍👍👍
Direct burial cable - I don't like it either, but it seems to be the way everyone goes, anymore. I've even had experience with distribution voltage (23kV) that was direct burial.
Cabin is looking great. Are you going to live in this cabin or just a get away??
The cabin is looking beautiful! It is always an adventure to watch builds slowly come together. Thanks so much for sharing!
Every time you promote Simplysafe, I think Canada isn't as safe as people are led to believe. But then again you folks up north have restrictive gun laws that prevents a person's ability to defend life and property.
why do u put them right to the corners??? u have to leave a gap for summer/winter expand of the wood
Dear Outsider      It was particularly enjoyable to watch the pressed fit of the last board of flooring.  It is a testament to your skill level and your diligence in attending to all of the details involved in a project like this.  From measuring twice to always making sure that your sawmill is cutting true.  To make the edges of floor boards truly parallel requires that your saws are cutting straight.  I watched early videos when you and Outsider Senior were setting logs on top of boulders the two of you took the time to make certain that the structure was square.  And now that investment has paid off because the walls of the cabin are still square all of these years later.  Simply amazing!      God bless you and your family!
I can feel the love inside that cabin right through my laptop. The beauty in every detail is a marvelous sight for the eyes. I absolutely love your drone video shots because you can hear all the Chickadees chirping in the trees.
This guy builds a remote cabin far from the problems of society and corporations, and then fills the place with cloud connected cameras and sensors so even there he gets monitored. FFS people only use LOCALLY HOSTED security equipment this is perimeter security 101!! There are tons of proper trusted local solutions, yes they are hard to set up, you can hire someone to do it or learn about them.
Absolutely beautiful craftsmanship. ❤️👍🇺🇲
This cabin is incredibly well thought out in terms of its equipment. And it's getting more and more comfortable. I like your work very much. Greetings from Germany
Great job i love watching your video so relaxing are you still going to produce videos once the cabin is complete i hope you will
Wow!!! Great work, and you’re so precise. Congratulations!
For Christ's sake, put the tape away.  If you can't eye-ball those screws to your satisfaction, use a measuring stick.  Imagine how much time you will save . . . the next time.
Glad to see you got some rain. We (Western NY) could use more. Most awesome cabin ever!
What a amazing and beautiful project!    Dad is proud of you!
It’s looking absolutely beautiful.  When the floor is finished it will look stunning.  I love the idea of the pennies, quite unique.  It must be so hard emotionally carrying on without your Dad but you are a chip of the old block and he will be immensely proud.  Take care, be safe.  ❤️ Dorset, UK
One thing I think would work for you is to pound Rebar Rod into the ground 3'  deep and attach the solar array to the Rebar. You could bend a 90° at the top of the Rebar drill a hole into your post to connect the 2. I really enjoy your video's. Thank You for bringing us along.
The cabin has turned out beautiful!  I'm sure you miss your Dad.  We sure do.
Really a great job y‘ve done. Greets from Germany.  Volker
SimpliSafe why would you pay somebody else $30 a month to call the police they don't show up in the first place you're better off getting off your butt and going there yourself they don't come to home robberies anymore
It's been an absolute pleasure being on this journey with you. Thank you for opening up parts of your life for us.
I often wonder about your faith as you seem to be away from your youth work a lot on your own no one to help we all need fellowship you had that with your father but what of your family and church
That is one gorgeous floor. I see your dad in every step you take.
The pine boards look great, that is some tedious work making all those holes for all those pennies, you have the patience of a saint my friend, can`t wait to see the sanding and poly go on those boards.
Great video.   You say everything just right.
My wife wouldn’t watch YouTube for a full minute. This morning I tried to explain to her who you are. The significance of your accomplishments. The talent, perseverance, foresight, and love you and your family have put into your cabin build. The challenges you have overcome. And the amazing love and respect you have shown to viewers, the nature that surrounds you, and to your family. Your strong faith shines throughout all of your videos. Your a testimony to me and to the thousands of viewers around the world. Thank you Outsider for blessing me.
So glad to see you back and working on the cabin.  I'm sure the going is a lot slower without your father by his side, but I'm also certain that he would be proud of your progress.  Wishing you and your family well
Everything is looking amazing. All the pennies is going to make a nice touch to the cabin. Stay safe ✌️😎👍
Looking forward to seeing what you do for the back door!
We are 78 and 84.  We installed our system and feel so much more secure.  I'm glad we got it a few years ago.
Good Morning! Great to see the cabin progress. Again, more inspiration of your superb craftsmanship.Thank you so much for taking the extra time to share your journey. God Speed!
Good morning from Syracuse NY brother and everyone else and thank you for sharing your earlier video on the cabin
I know Me. Outsider is smiling seeing his son completing the vision. Every time I watch I think of your Dad and the journey you both kindly shared with us. Thank You!  Know that he is with you always and his lessons and voice will carry you the rest of your days.
Doesn’t look like you left any room for expansion  Snapping a chalk line on your finished product… 😆
Blessings to you Brother.  You and your dad, likely built from a dream, so his legacy will always be with you.
Your cabin is beautiful!👍😊
You need to buy a mattock. A mattock will make quick work of the roots and clay. A mattock has a axe on one side and a adze on the other.
While the physical presence of Sr. Outsider may be missing, those of us who’ve been here for the journey can see him everywhere. While we miss him, we also know that he lives on. With love and much respect from South Carolina. God bless the Outsider family. 💗
What a beautiful cabin. A work of art, hard work and determination.
Your Drone footage is always so beautiful.
Awesome job on the floor, I'm sure your Dad is watching down on you smiling.
❤️👌🏆🏆🏆
Such a work of art, skill and love! It really is a fine family get-away.
Thank you for another episode, viele Grüße aus Deutschland, greetings from Germany and god bless your family, so sorry for your loss
The flooring is gonna be nice. I'm sure its hard to be there by yourself but remember, someday you'll be together again.
great
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Always a good morning when we're surprised by a update by "the Outsider "....everything is coming together and looking so well...the professionalism and outstanding techniques you display are obviously signs you were paying attention while being raised....he'll always be there !!!...."cheers"
Great work, your dad is looking down very proud.
Am an your cute Subscriber from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 I love your. vedio
Thanks for sharing! For 20 minutes, I forgot about everything else.
The pennies are a fantastic idea. Your child will sit looking at them, probably the adult children too! I know to chop down trees isn't a great idea, but the limited amount of direct sunlight will be a charging issue once you start using the electricity. It's not just a warm loving home it's a wonderful memory/legacy of your father you have created.
Your dad is proud of U
Thank you Outsider👍🏻
We found that a tractor and a subsoiler make a great method to bury pipe.  The idea is for the subsoiler to feed the pipe as it digs the hole.  Some people weld a guide tube onto the subsoiler.
It’s oddly wonderful how attuned I have become to Mr. Outsider. The moment this video began I felt that sense of loss knowing that Dad isn’t here to chat, carry, cut and give advice or the satisfaction of his approval. And my sense of that is just a tiny ripple, a quiet echo of the loss his family must feel.  Also, watching the opening drone footage I immediately thought that Mr. Outsider might want to think about trimming back the branches over that solar array. No worries. He’s on it.  Thanks for bringing us along.
Thank you for sharing, the floor is going to amazing when done. God bless you too.
Still the best cabin out there. Great video again.
You are very talented. I am sure those skills were encouraged by your wonderful father. Along with you, we all miss seeing your teamwork. He was very proud of you as are all who know you. God Bless 🐻🙏🇺🇸🇺🇸
Love when I get notifications about new videos. Hope you and your family are all well.
I really enjoy watching your videos and have for a long time  and just wanted to say thanks and that your videos have brought me a form of peace
Awesome 😍😍😍
Anchoring the array I live on an atlantic island regular 120mph gusts. I have 6 yacht mast stay cables  holding mine down. Used 5ft angle bar hammered into rough ground with drilled eyehole. Never going to move. Any marina has lots scrap cable going  cheap. Weakest point for me is the panel mounts to the frame which I check regular.
It's been a long time ⌛, my friend. Hope all is well 🙏 and looking forward to seeing more wonderful things you are doing. Cheers 🍻 with love ❤ from Singapore 🇸🇬 💋👏👏👏
아버지 가 생각이 많이 나네요 화이팅 하세요 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷👍👍👍🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷
Ya no what kiddo. I love the intro & the exit. Axe in, Axe out. But you've aged a bit. It's not looking like you so much. Been at it fer quite some time. Sorry bout yer father. We all grieve in our own way. Be safe, bless the family & God bless.
That looks absolutely fantastic. Your dad would be very proud of you. All the best.
Beautiful cabin you and Dad did a amazing job !
In your aerial view of your cabin it struck me that the way the dormer windows are lined up and off center you have a beautiful cross on the roof. How appropriate!
Congratulations on the great job you have done. You had a great father and I am  sorry for the loss. Best wishes! Greetings from the Dolomites, Italy.
Great to see your vids back up again post your loss
About the solar array - filling the base in with stone rubble should weigh it down and secure it against any toppling over and might work better than bracing ... great work I am envious ...
I get goose bumps with every episode and the missing part is heart felt peace young man
God gave us memories that we might have roses in December. Seeing video of you and your dad working on the cabin together brings back good memories. Floor looks great lots of detail work with inlaying the pennies but the results are fantastic. Thanks for sharing. Stay safe
Guarantee that trench took more then 15 minutes to dig! ;)
Very nice
응원합니다 👍👍👍🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🌻☕🌻💗💗💗
I pray for you brother- you have been though a lot. You have  this keep up the great work. Cabin looking good. I understand the pain I lost my Mom at 60 My Dad 13 years later.
Every Saturday morning I get my coffee and look for your newest video. Some days I just have coffee, but some days are like today. Thanks for this content. No cheesy music. Just a craftsman doing his thing. Stay well and keep it up.
It's looking real good.
I hope this build continues forever.  Thank you.
Good job on everything
I’m sure everyone was as happy as me to see you continued the penny plug treatment on the main floor. Good project to finish on those rainy days…
Get a bunch of pennys with the same year as your dads birth.  Put one in each area of the cabin.  That way your dad will always be with you.
Truly enjoy your videos - envy your time among the trees. Your cabin is fantastic and such a great reflection of you and your dad’s hard work together. My dad passed away earlier this year - I understand your feeling of absence. Keep up the good work.
floor looks great
Thank you for the video. Love the addition of the pennies (aren't the pennies from your dad?). Look forward to the continued progress. Stay safe and God bless.
Always a treat to watch your progress. Amazed and impressed can't describe what you and your Dad have accomplished. Looking forward to each episode. Wishing you continued success, safety, and good health.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
nice video
Grreat work again.  God bless you buddy ♥
Although the trees offer great protection from the wind, I would still use a couple of those auger anchors they use on house trailers.
God Bless you and your family too, thank you for sharing.
Great to see another episode.  We all miss your dad but with his Spirit, you carry on. Thanks always for sharing.
I'm pretty sure the floor is going to look amazing like the rest of the cabin.  Take care of yourself. Thanks for sharing 👍
Every video is perfect! How did you get the battery box to fit underneath the cabin? I remember it was a bit too tall! The memories you have of building this with your father are priceless. It reminds me of a Jewish saying : May his memory be a blessing. I'm sure it is! Peace.
Good morning from Ohio. Watching you make the flooring was amazing! You have so many talents and gifts. I agree there is someone missing but when I look around the cabin I see your Dad’s hands touched every part of it. I did cry and I’m tearing up typing this. Thank you for sharing another wonderful video with us, God Bless.  P.S. A while back the discussion about you being there alone and possibly getting hurt, have you considered getting like a Apple Watch or a Android Watch to wear. That way you’d have something you could wear to alert emergency if you got hurt. Just a suggestion. I’m a worrier and care about you.
بسیار عالی 👍👍
God bless
I hate to sound like a broken record but get your DUST mask on you protect your ears now protect your lungs
Perhaps you could use ty-downs, the kind they install on mobile homes. Installation is quick and cost is low.
I love the flooring & also a good thunderstorm makes it so cozy! I hate that your Dad is gone, but you will carry him with you forever with all he gave you & has taught you! 🙏🏻
i would put the first[or last] few feet of that cable  in flexible metal tubing
It looks very cosy.
Awesome video brother. God bless you and you have a beautiful cabin, built with love and friendship and a wonderful loving family with the love of God. What more could one ask for. Blessed we are.
Always a treat to see your hard work sir.
👍
Great video once again. It's incredible to see the transformation in a years time. I agree with you It's missing one thing *sniff* BTW I LOVE how you're incorporating pennies into the flooring BRILLIANT idea!
Awesome!
very nice floor your dad would like it well done
The flooring is going to be gorgeous.  I’ve stayed away from the internet for a while just for piece of mind.  Good to see you again.. God bless.
Thanks Outsider, good job, good video.
Epic build... your skill, patients, and craftsmanship is on another level. I'm sure your father is beaming with pride as he watches over the project. You are a true inspiration in these troubling times, thank you and God Bless
I hadn't been watching for a while. It's so impressive now. Remarkable.
Wonderful craftsmanship. Hoping all is well with you and the Mrs. Thank you for allowing us to all come along on your journey. Peace!
The house and your work is wonderful. I see you Dad everywhere in that build. Thank you for sharing your work with us.
there is oxygen in the forest
Very nice 👌  🌺🌸🌸🌹🌸🌸🌺 SS from India 🇮🇳
Always enjoy your video. I hope your family is safe and doing well.
Have to admit man, I used to think the penny inlay was a goofy idea, but I really like it now - awesome job man!
Must be expensive to put that much money into a floor 😜
I understand the void you feel without your father. Been there. Time heals the body and spirit. As for the solar/generator, at first it seems out of place for a cabin. However it is a useful convenience. You've done a good job minimizing it's intrusion indoors. Hoping to soon see family and friends in and about the cabin. What a memorial it is!
Sir, I am an INDIAN and I watch your all videos 🎥🎥🎥
Halo..saya dari Indonesia.. 🇮🇩 terimakasih..atas  dan Vidio nya.. 👍👍
Great job young outsider!!!    Good job on the " solar" ,n , the floor is going to be awesome! C Ya on the next vid!        👍🐾🐺🧙‍♂️🐺🐾👍!
The cabin must be even more special as the last big project that you and your dad both worked on. The land around is so beautiful that’s it like an enormous memorial to your precious memories of these very important and loved family members.
I think I'm as excited as you, great work!! Dad would be smiling down watching you.
👍👍👍👌
✋🏼🇦🇺👍🏼
Still brought a tear to my eye, thinking of your dad....   Cabin is a beautiful piece of art work.  A true treasure for life....   Love, Blessings & Peace
It looks so beautiful and snugly built inside.  Also, you make every step of this process look so easy, no doubt to all your forethought and planning.  Well done!
Every time u post a new video the cabins just gets more and more beautiful  I'm a huge log cabin fan an of ur content  stay safe
👍👍👍
As always, love to see new videos from you!!  I miss seeing your dad help you.  God bless!!
Everyday is better. You’re doing very well
Great Work & Video. #STAYSAFE  #PHILLYPHILLY 🇺🇸
What an admirable and beautiful accomplishment!👍
Build is looking so good! You’ve done an incredible job!
Another great video...thanks!
Just curious about the flooring... Did you leave any edge space between the flooring and the walls, like a quarter of an inch or so? Everyone has always told me you have to allow a gap for such flooring, as it will expand/contract through the seasons. The cabin's looking simply beautiful, a family heirloom.
Looking good!!
Thank you for sharing with us again! God Bless you as well young man!  #BeSafe
The only disappointing thing about these videos is that they end so soon! I truly look forward to them every time. Thank you for taking us on your journey.
Excellent 👍 looks fantastic
🇳🇱SUPER👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🍀💯
So excited for the buildout also. God bless you brother and your family always
I found spar varnish much better than polyurethane for my floors.  Cost more , but has held up better than projects I used poly  for.
Dude. You should have went with packed dirt for that early pioneer motif.
Good work.
medal conduit underground will endure what nature has to dish out.
Put a dime some where in the floor in memory of your Dad. Finding dimes, or seeing the number 10, is said to be a message to “pay attention,” and “trust your instincts and intuition.” Sometimes the coin is from a year that was important in some way in your relationship with someone who has passed, and it may be a sign that your loved one isn't as distant as you thought.
The floor looks magnificent! It does seem like that….you & Dad! I miss him. I know you do. Your Dad left you with skills you can’t pay for buddy! Keep up the good work! Nice move on the conduit! I wish that I could help. I say several hours!
is this a replete im sure you did that before ????????? you did the floor before and put the coins in that floor before ?????
Your Dad would be really proud of you <3
Watching here in the Philippines ❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This house is beautiful ! It is very sad your Dad would not be with too see it finished .
Beautiful footage of the Amazon rain forest ;-)
I see those leaves chaging colour. Can't believe that another summer is coming to a close. But so pleased to see so much progress on the cabin since this time last year!
Nice scribe work. Gotta build Lazutin bee frames today. Also while raining.
🙌💃🙌 You're back 🙌💃🙌 Your cabin is so beautiful, & your front door is incredible!! You & your daddy are 2 very talented men!! I know he's still there with you!! God bless you and your family. I'm praying 💞🙏
HEY!  Good morning!   I hope that your wife is doing well, wising you all the very best.  Thank you for sharing with us!
Yay! I’ve been waiting on another one of your videos 🥰
Good Morning Outsider! A bright light at the beginning of my day in Colorado. Glad to hear from you!
first comment! love your videos!!!!
