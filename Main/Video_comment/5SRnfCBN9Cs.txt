at least there was a goal
That’s respect the min of silence here acc silent
Friday 16th September 2022
Aweful game, can only think they allowed the offside goal after review in some hope the entertainment level would improve.  Both villa players where off and Konza challenged the keeper before it cam off the post.. maybe the VAR official was playing candycrush or something
That attempt with an open goal was shocking. How can a player be that bad?!
Fantastic utv
That goal was offside
That was the best game I’ve ever seen😂😂
Crap game . Been a Villa fan all my life but this 3 passes a long ball then losing it up the pitch has got to end. And for me the blame for that lays at the coaches feet. Our players are better than that. Utter shambles.
Villa first half enough to see off Southampton and a much needed win.
Stevie wonder
The most exciting part of this was the one minute silence at the beginning.
H kane🟥  yes yes yes 🙌 👏 😍 👌
Welcome to hassent got a clue ball😁
I've loved Gerrard for 20 odd years now. I've seen a lot of his interviews and watched him speak as a pundit now as well. Gerrard philosophy is something closer to Benitez/Mourinho.
Good 3 points for villa but still not a good game, both teams were bad
Glad I watched Forest Fulham over this 😅
This had throwbacks to the 2nd time around of Graham Taylor years ago. Mings was the star player and forward.
How was the goal not offside? 0:52 Not from the initial cross but Ramsey's off when Watkins heads it towards goal. The fact the 'keeper saves it onto the crossbar should not make any difference. Still, good to see Villa pick up points.
Villa seemed completely unable to pass the ball in a straight line. Whenever there was a chance they'd just give it away for nothing.  All the chances from both teams came from set pieces or someone just whacking it up the pitch, that's an issue when Villa insisted on playing it slow and losing the ball at the halfway line
Offside in my day. They probably said different phase of play but offside to me.
watkins was poor, ings has to be starting over him from now on
I think Brendan Rogers should go to Villa, would have them playing good ball. His time at lcfc is over and Gerrard is an poor manager.
The worst match in history
Gerrard would have been ousted if he had lost this
He was offside
Without question one of the worst games of football I’ve ever seen 💩
One of the worst games I've ever watched.
worst game i’ve ever watched at least when we lost 9-0 they were funny - hasenhüttl needs to get sacked
Aston villa fans  are deluded
Can people just not accept that Gerard and lampard aren’t good managers…
Guys it’s just the beginning of the season and we have some easy matches coming up. Besides we have played some pretty decent teams so far.
Both will end up mid table
How that goal wasn't an offside?I really don't undestand anymore!
was Ramsey not offside from Watkins’ header? 🤷🏻‍♂️
Okay it was dire but 3 points is massive. Massive respect to both sets of fans for the tributes.
I was there I was
Deadest game ever should have shown The other one
Well done to the Villa for the pre match stuff. Eye bleeding game to watch, thought Southampton were the worst opposition at VP since Stoke or QPR in the championship days.
Honostly we have the most fickle fans ever . Ok the game wasn't great but it's 3 points and your all crying Gerrard out but last week we drew to city and it was like oh I can see what he's trying to do 🙈 so your happy with a point agaisnt city and not happy with a scrappy 1-0 win against Southampton makes sense
I chose this over Fulham vs forest lol
Hats off to Karen Carney by the way, for being one of the few pundits/ex-pros across all match coverage to know the offside law well enough to explain correctly why the goal is a valid one. However, more analysis on the possible red card would've been helpful - the question the panel should've been discussing was "did the offence amount to  Serious Foul Play (a red card), the criteria for which is "excessive force or brutality, endangering the safety of the opponent". Challenges that r only deemed Reckless and/or Dangerous r yellow card offences max.
Everybody is saying that both teams were awful and as a villa fan I was there at the game atleast we actually scored and won 🏆
Where has the time and score gone from the corner?!
tragic game
There is no guarantee that should Gerrard come to Anfield–as Coach; after Jürgen–he shall have success. Steven was not a great success at Glasgow Rangers; or, as at the minute, with Aston villa.
Douglas Luiz goat corner taker
The commentator during the match was sure that the goal was going to be ruled offside.....and then it wasn't. Not saying it should have been, but the reason the commentator was convinced that it would be deemed offside is because we have seen them given for a lot less. I mean the guy was literally hanging out in the centre two yards from goal while the ball was bouncing around with his original position being an offside one, I'm pretty sure both the goalkeeper and the defenders were aware of him and acted accordingly. I think it's time to go automated VAR as there is no consistency at the moment.
Wild how none of the big pundits are calling out Stevie G. Was rumours last year they were protecting Ole, and this year it looks like they're protecting Gerrard. Isn't good enough to coach Villa.  Shoulda stayed in the Scottish league
Can you boo a win? Asking for a Villa supporting friend.
Not even joking that was the worst sporting event I’ve ever watched and easily the worst game of football i’ve ever watched
Why wasn’t the goal scorer offside?
UK propaganda is real.
worst game ever. gerrard is lucky to be in a job. that squad should be playing a lot better.
The best managers were't made in a  day.
Both teams were shocking 😳
*Mings plays a simple one touch 3 yard pass* “Tyrone Mings did brilliant he really did!”
🥱 yawn
Skysport should have shown the minute silence and applause, as it would have been more entertaining than the highlights of the match
Ohhhh gavin bazunu 😂😂😂 play up Pompey
Can't believe Gerrard still has a job 😂😂 If he wasn't English, he'd be long gone
How did Ings miss an open goal
Ings could have scored but he didn’t want to against his old team. He could have passed
Won ugly..got no problem with that..4 points out of the last 6..only thing that matters at this time
People thought Southampton were decent because they beat a terrible Chelsea side 🤣
Are there any white players left in the Villa squad . This is the opposite of diversity in action
Sad to think we (City) managed to drop points against this Villa side 🙄
Gavin bazunu up the saints! Skates build ships can't make it past ? Isle of _____
What did you expect? 😂
Unfortunately this match was my first premiere league match in my life and I got a Lil bit disappointed as there were no plan from both teams just kick and rush without any shoots on the goal
Great to see Ramsey get another.
R.I.P Queen Elizabeth II.
Carragher is awfully lost, bless. “The crowd booing Douglas Luiz” 🤣
Not great game but villa don’t care massive win for them
Big win for Gerrard. Hope this will ease up the pressure on him
fair play sky making 2 mins out of this
Diving when not necessary costs dearly
Going through the motions does not take pressure off Gerrard. Pretty poor from Villa and a better team would have taken advantage of us. 10 months in charge and 2 transfer windows and he doesn't know his best 11? potentially back around the bottom 4 by the end of weekend. I think Stevie G is out of his depth.
How was that goal not disallowed for offside? Ramsey was offside when the first ball was played in, then he was offside when the Villa player headed it and the keeper saved it onto the bar then Ramsey gets the rebound and scores
Can't believe Gerrard made Mcginn captain this season and not Martinez. Not only is Martinez a leader, but he is also a guaranteed starter. Mcginn is only keeping his place because he's captain. He has been absolutely awful the whole of this season and really weakens that midfield. Contributes nothing forward, makes lots of unecessary fouls and gives the ball away a lot.
Ings could of played a nice pass to the right, but he saw open net and was like f*ck it 🤣
no mitro no problemo
the most pathetic performance i’ve seen from us this season. everybody was off it today, we simply had nothing going forward and the midfield couldn’t keep possession. we really miss lavia, i hope he’s back after the break and we can get back to winning ways.
Watching the game was horrid looked sloppy, not sure what’s going on honestly.
I would've liked to have watched / heard the crowd clapping on the 70th minute for the Queen. RIP
I don't understand what either team was trying to do, it was such a painful watch. Our football under Gerrard is so turgid.
You won't see many worse games than this one all season! This was truly an absolute shocker!
Can we have coutinho back please? 🙏 YNWA
I could see Grealish going back to Villa on loan in January if they're in trouble
Dont care if we win home games like that.   Ashley young is ok but surely we can get another fullback. Never understood letting Targett go (but maybe was his choice).
Villa Fan ...The football was poor to be fair from both sides. Glad for 3 points which are much needed but we have probably played 1 of the poorest teams in the league and didn't dominate or control the game , which is a bit worrying.. Gerrard- ball is still a mystery to me as the style is so stuttering and fractured. Nevertheless, we go on.  UTV
Two fantastic teams showcasing the masterpiece that is the premier league
That has to go down as the worst ever prem game. Absolutely atrocious
Villa needed this win badly for Gerard’s sake. Best football bet of the night even despite it only being a 1-0 win.  Cheers villa
The only positive I can take from that being a villa fan and to be fair it’s a decent positive is we would of lost that a month or so back.  Sometimes winning ugly is what a struggling side needs let’s hope that’s the case
its the highlights, no need for the minute silence for your supreme leader
This was one of the worst games of football I have ever watched. Seemed like both managers had given their players no tactical plans and just said go out there and try your best.
That shot from Ings shows why Liverpool sold him
It’s an awkward one because we’ve drawn to Man City and beat Southampton but I’d still sack gerrard. Theres no style in our play, we lack any sort of creative flowing football and just hoof it forwards. Our defence is the saving grace of the team cause our midfield and attack is dreadful
I'm severely disabled and need help with almost everything. That being said: Mr Gerrard, I am available on a free transfer and would be much more useful to you than Leon Bailly.
That was worse than watching 24 hours of live feed of the queue to see the queen's coffin on BBC
Worst game of the season contender
Imagine being the guy who's job it was to edit 30mins of best footage from that game🤣🤣
s/ton only registered 1 shot on target in the dying minutes of the game, they were blunt upfront, villa really needed them 3 points,
We definitely needed that win! It was not smooth though, quiet stressful to watch. But a wins a win!
Fair play to the editor for putting together highlights. That's dedication to the craft 👏
Ralph out
Ultimately nothing has changed under Gerrard and the style of football we play is awful. We will lose a lot of matches if something doesn't change and fast.
Maybe one of the worst games in PL history it was that bad. Gerrard will not last at Villa.
no ramsey is not offside as the Southampton defender makes a deliberate play on the ball, negating the offside.
Carragher getting excited when former lfc player has a chance.... bell
One of worst adverts for Premier League football
That was indeed a game that happened
This is a huge 3 points for villa, but in reality is it papers over the cracks. No plan, no nothing. Awful football, awful style of play. Saints were horrendous and I’m sorry to say but we still need a new manager with some kind of real plan. Mings however was excellent. Please villa, see that this manager isn’t the right one.
I'm a villa fan and that was terrible, I was falling asleep midway through the first half. One of the most boring games I've watched.
Wow, just wow. Who else is glad they watched the Forest vs Fulham game?
Compare this game to Newcastle vs Man City and this was like a  Game between 2 bottom half championship sides. Awful
Really awful game both teams ball retention skills where shocking. I bet sky wished they had broadcast the other game on tonight.
People saying villa played awful which may be true I didn't watched the game but at the end of the day I'd rather play bad and win then play well and draw or lose. Sacking Gerrard is not a guarantee anything will change. I think fans need to give people more time
If that Ings shot didn't curve... Still many improvements to be made and errors to thinks within a large number of players. Big win, UTV.
Be worried if I was a Southampton fan 😬
does anyone have a video of the 70th min applause from sky?
Ultimately, villa aren't bad enough to go down.
Get Brendan to replace Steven. Ps poch would never take the Villa job
Suprised they got highlights of the game with how awful it was
Don't care about the performance. We ain't Barcelona. 3 pts for us. 0 for Southampton
Ofc sky put this snoozefest on instead of the 5 goal thriller between fulham and forest
I'd be interested to hear what Baileys dad thinks of his performance tonight
This relieves no pressure off gerrard we were absolutely terrible. No system no plan just awful
Was offside Watkins last to touch it before it fell to ramsey
Glad I didn't watch all of it apparently both teams were dreadful
Last🙂
Who else is glad they decided to watch the Fulham vs Forest game 😂😅
Most boring football match that I’ve ever watched.
Worse game of football in the history of the sport
Being a villa fan 💜💙 I’m delighted with the 3 points but Jesus we are still just as awful!! No flare or identity! McGinn has been off the boil for a long time and I’m sorry but Leon Bailey is a truly truly awful footballer. It says something when a 37 year old Ashley young is your most consistent player! On to Leeds 💜💙
I wish I was watching forest against Fulham instead of this 😭
Is it just me or even including the little break because of the queen's passing but a lot of teams just aren't up to speed this season? Lot of unfit players across the league
Does he ease preshure off gerard tho? We need to stop normalising that it's only the managers fault whenever a team is doing bad for a few months. It happens
worst premier league game of all time
not a pretty performance but we got the dub and now we move
i picked the wrong game to watch, :/
We need to get coutinho back for cheap, I’d rather have him in the squad just for those magical show
villas attack is just so unimpressive, much needed 3 points though.
this is why forest are useless
SD in DA HOUSE
Hometown Cha Cha Cha. Watch it. You’re welcome.
Very deflating performance but hopefully I'll get sacked in the morning  yeeeee  corse
Worst game of the season so far?
Great result for Villa, hope Gerrard stays in the Premier League where he should be!
RIP queen 🪦 ❤
Villa needed that
Yh
both teams awful
How dose luke Shaw get ahead of mings in the England squad 😂
Guy's I'm crying, RIP the Queen 😥
Audio out of sync again
Worst Premier League game in a loooong time. These teams really need to up their game.
That was 95 mins of my life i'll never get back, both teams were awful
First
360p?!??
