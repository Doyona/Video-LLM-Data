STAR WARS FOREVER✊️👏👏👏👏👏👏Z
too bad the show was woke
Electric
9:25 😊
I could sit and listen to Ewan just talk all day. That Scottish accent….🥵❤️
I truly hope Hayden continues to play Anakin/Vader for many years to come
5 seconds of this interview is better than the entire Disney sequel trilogy
Is the Kenobi movie a diffent go??
'Just keep sitting there asking more questions as we farm all the galaxies aura.  BTW notice my Jedi White pants.'
Sunday I had an Photoshoot With Hayden ❤
This does put a smile on my face
The fact they are wearing the Obi-Wan and Anakin colours is perfection.
Anyone else think the fans are annoying and ruining the interview? 🙄
Pathetic how over hyped they are acting with the crowd.
Love to be alive to see Hayden❤ Anakin
(jump) : hello there
Imagine making a film and pouring your blood sweat and tears into it. And getting to step out into a crowd of people who have been impacted by and it. God this is amazing.
Hayden Christensen is such a sweet heart. Such a shame what happened to his career, he will always be Anakin to me!
I usually don't really like constant screaming and heckling from audiences - this time, I'm good with it. ❤️❤️
yes we are all gooning to Hayden’s and ewan 20 years later 👅👅
they really started playing boss music when Hayden and Ewan walked up man
super dope
Their walk out is so good
Bro just stop shouting let them speak
When the prequels came out, they were shunned. Now, they are the stars of the franchise. God, I love it!
They were not letting them speak 🤣
@2:35 bro in the back aura farming
Hayden dressed in black like Anakin and Evan in brown reference Episode 3
2:37 Did anyone lese catch that sick flip from that guy in the back?
Gwiezdne Wojny powinny łączyć, a nie dzielić wszyscy jesteśmy rodziną 🥰🥰
I am so incredibly happy for Hayden to get all the love and appreciation he deserves. Such a humble and genuine man. Brings tears to my eyes watching him up there.  I know this comment is gonna get lost amongst the thousands but I just want to put out a word of love and appreciation for Jake Lloyd as well. From what I've read he's had a rough life ever after Star Wars. He did a great job on young Anakin and I thoroughly enjoyed his performance. I hope he's going to get better and eventually experiences the same or something similar as Hayden does.
Show was awful...they were great!
Is it weird that it almost hurts my chest that Star Wars isn't real? I feel a little acoustic saying that "out loud" lol, but it's true.
These two became legends for the rest of the history for sure.
0:39 is that how you pronounce it?
I love the duo: Ewan and Hayden. The crowd and the fans are giving them so much love. 😁😍
So glad for Hayden. He got so much flack for the prequels. After the Kennedy disaster movies now they love him. just heard he’s coming back for Ashoka season 2 hopefully kenobi S2. These 2 on screen again together brings D+ mad money!
not a single cheer when Ewan mentioned Alec Guinness.... sad
Hayden is sweating through 2 or three layers of clothing and doesnt feel very well right in this moment XD
More years of life to this couple of brothers.
Man ❤❤❤ Hayden Is so sexyyyyy
9:40 He said again,absolutly Cinema!,we love you Ewan and Hayden <3
George Lucas prophecy fulfilled. Back when Hayden was receiving so much hate, George told him, "One day they will love you".
The clone wars fixed anakins character. Prequel anakin was à broody moody dumbass teenager. Clone wars anakin is badass, confident, funny and charismatic.
2:36 look at this guy in the background flipping a lightsaber
I loved the prequels 20yrs ago and still love them now
all this for a dogshit show about a midget being taken hostage and a black queen that wants her revenge on the patriarchy
Growing up on Star Wars, even in Zimbabwe, I loved the prequels almost completely because of these 2. Thank you Ewan and Hayden! I hope you feel the love and appreciation we all have for you and the characters you played SO WELL.
Haydn gorgeous, me jealous
Women can't choose between dark and good side of power 👄
Is that sweat
Dude with saber skills at 2:38 ❤❤
Hayden is just feeling the love he’s doesn’t even know how to express it except accept the love with smiles
Props to the interviewer matched fans energy well
2:36 actual Vader having fun spinning his Lightsaber in the back
4:04 did it just say "Darth Vader, OBI WAN KENOBI"???
This is so lovely 😊❤
How can you top this?  Any guest after them is like, "I'm screwed".
Love the applause and cheers the Hayden got and Ewan as well but honestly this dudes interview is weak and it was a struggle opening up conversation and getting them to want to open up and getting excited 😅
Lord, please watch over them. They are so beautiful.
Every time Ewan gets on stage I wish he would say “hello there”
I want a season 2 of Kenobi but with an improvement in the story, I liked the first one although it had its mistakes but it is a story that could be totally improved and with parts that I loved and that could be touched on in a possible continuation, Kenobiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii !!!
There should be a Trilogy of films before the Prequels to see what happened to Count Doku and how Obi Wan grows and to connect with the Prequels, and with the final stage of the High Republic or with The Acolyte and other parallel stories but always without the woke tint, the dirty progressivism that destroys good stories, fans want more Star Wars lore
Imagine if Ewan just simply said "hello there"
I don't know why they panned Kenobi series. I liked it. Thought it was great. Only thought Moses Ingram's physical acting, her running, was whack but otherwise thought everyone did great.
TLDR 9:39
I want both of them to do more as anakin and obi won
i rewatch this regularly to keep the fire of life lit inside me
Like brothers
Hayden Christensen 💕 💕
I can't watch revenge of the sith without crying
Lol 6:08 basically nobody chants to the growing up part except one guy.  The memories we have shall keep us youthful. Kind of a shame that the kids won't have that newly released 1-3 or 4-6 experience.
I hope they do more Events with those Guys and Liam Neeson aka Qui-Gon Jinn .. They aren"t here for ever, right? So take the Chance while there still there and give us the Stuff we deserve .. Man seeing those two gives me Nostalgia i was freaking 12-14 Years Old when i watched those Movies im now 34 and i still enjoy there Movies,Series like the first Time i watched it.. There just a differente Generation of hard working, dedicated Actors it became rare these Days.. Dont fumble just put them in Movies,Series and let them work they realy deserve it!!
The crowd interrupting is annoying me
Hayden is a phenomenal actor! He did an excellent job in the prequels. It’s amazing to see him get the recognition he deserves.
Hell yea
May the force be with you Always 💪💪💪💪💪💪♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️👍👍👍👍👍👍
The Master and the Padawan! =)
2020 was the year Disney started to inject their virus into the Star Wars franchise, in order to watch it rot from the inside. 😔
It''s weird that all the hosts keep mispronouncing Hayden's last name to ChristIAnsen
He won me over with his line at the end of the interview. Hayden is talented and smart and deserves the love of his fans!
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
It‘s sad that the sequel made people realize that anakin wasnt that bad
Hayden's last words are the reason I keep coming back to this video.
Ever since this Star Wars has gone down hill by about 10x WHERE IS GERORGE
Ewan is use to the love. Hayden always looks so emotional in a good way.
@9:42 Hayden understood the assignment and nailed it. So happy for the love he’s getting.
why did they hate on himmmmmmm😢
💙💙💙
That guy at 2:38 definitely did that little trick for the camera
The best duo
3:56.... LOOK THE BANNER HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Make Star Wars LucasArts again. Disney, hands off
Does no one talk about the guy in the back? 2:37
2:37 the guy in the back was impressing
Ведущий педик, смотрите как говорит и сидит он😢
We as the fans always loved him as anakin/vader. We didn’t have the means to say it like we do now because social media hadn’t really took off.  The critics were the ones that were hating on him.
Revenge of the sith 20th anniversary times goes by very fast
Force is strong within theese two. They didn t age😎💪
I think it's great that the Star Wars Universe is finally showing love for Hayden. I remember seeing the prequels in the theaters and fans couldn't stand him. But thankfully fans finally gave the prequels especially Revenge of the Sith its do credit. I'm so happy for Hayden that he's so loved now.
The "You were my brother" and Hayden instantly answering "Yes we are" with Ewan pointing at the dude like "That's my guy" shows how much they appreciate each other, that's adorable !
Thank you Debra chow!!!!!!
I think it’s quite funny that the table is a beskar plate
3:00 Sydney Australia
People were so excited!!…and then the show came out… what a shame.
Willy rex?
Meeting  hayden  in Orlando  was awesome 😊
Hayden really researching and loving Clone Wars is very obvious from the scenes he's done since.
attack of the clones... did he forget there's an other prequel after that ? And that he wore the Darth Vader suit in that one ? I can't believe they made a Star Wars interview for the Star Wars youtube channel, and whoever wrote this doesn't know Star Wars
Was so cool.❤❤ also the man was a jedi in minute 2:37😮
1:34 Ewan was sitting just like obi wan on his council seat XD
Kudos to the fan that shouted "You're like brothers!!" because that is EXACTLY how these two are with each other. ☺
He remindes me of that old Cinderella song.    Don't know whatcha got tell it's gone.    The fans literally drove him away.    Then cried foul after 20 years of him being away.   He's OUR ONLY hope now!!   I'm just glad he's finally getting his propers!!❤
So happy for Hayden he deserves the love now.
That outro gets me every time... would've been hazardous being in that crowd at that moment!
2:37 guy in the back just styling with the saber
That was some good interviewing rigth there
This just awesome men a lot of people together getting along
Hayden IS Anakin and Vader. Now and forever. I'm thankful for all he's done for Star Wars.
9:40 this is where the fun begins
I hope Hayden didn’t try to slaughter any children that laughed at him after this interview
They way they put their hands around each other leaving the stage shows there friendships
cool how they played ¨Duel Of The Fates¨. though i personally think that song is more fitting if they had Ray Park come out since that song is so associated with Darth Maul.
You were like brothers 5:36
Hayden should have received this treatment more oftenand earlier
9:40 Did Stone Cold Steve Austin return? What an amazing pop haha
The Hayden chant was awesome, im thankful they got the applause they deserve
2:38 i cant be the only one who caught that amazing flip
Ashtyn Throughway
Jermain Vista
Miller Maria Williams Betty Martin William
9:41 Hayden cements his place in fans hearts. Even Ewan knew that was the perfect thing to say.
Are we not talking about Hayden Christensen being known as Kenobi
The entry music should have been the Battle of Heroes
what's the thing with sand???please someone help
I need a series about the missions they both went on during the clone wars times
ccuhh , so whose got the best fan base????!!!!! Well this question is the least real one, we all know the answer, dudes this clip made everyone sure for sure, period! ... and I love both of them for all their workes out of Star Wars but for Star Wars I love them even more!!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why was Hayden so hated in the past i dont get it ... there was no freaking reason his performance in the movies were awesome .
Just circling back on this one 2+ years later…
#MyVader
Anakin's "gone through some changes." Hayden should have said, "That name no longer has any meaning for me."
04:30 Did he used the force to silence the crowd??? Still so powerfull...
Since these guys don’t age they could do 2 more movies together my idea would be to do a movie between 1 and 2 and another between 2 and 3 we already got Rouge One that takes place between 3 and 4. It be cool to see more adventures with these two.
Disney definitely fumbled the bag with these two, they should’ve brought them back for more projects.
Two legends right there. In all that time they both still look the same. Great guys too.
Hayden deserves all the love, both him and Ewan❤
Why is this "Anakin" sweating so much? Just look at his armpits-sweat showed even through his jacket!
@2:35 That smooth spin tho...
Hayden is one of my favorite actors the best jedi who ever lived

Everybody in the audience there were kids when watching the prequels and it was their first Star Wars experience, just like it was for me. The old people who started with the originals are still pissy with him, even though it was never his fault to begin with.
I love them! Hayden is genuine. Loved him then- love and RESPECT him now. Best Anakin/Vader. YES, MISSED YOU. 9:40  THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS.
"We missed you!" Yes, we really did!

That's what always happens people hate the movie when it comes out then decades later cult following they are beloved star wars horror movies lots of movies gives you hope for the sequel trilogy they hated when they came out watch they'll be loved one day daisy and others will get praise for the work they did lol
How many times have you replayed this part:  « this is where the fun begins » ? Answer : Yes
The crowd really did a good job hyping the set up 😍😍 thank you for giving them the love they always deserved ❤️❤️❤️

I watched the obi wan Kenobi series 6 times now. Love it!!!!
Love you Ewan and Hayden!!! I'm such a huge fan of you both! 💖
I keep seeing the comments on How Anakin/HC was dissed by the fans initially. Can anyone explain what happened? Sorry I was in kindergarten at that time so not really understand why these all happened. Am sure glad to see that overwhelming love and support Hayden gets because he seems like one solid man.
Hayden needed this.
cant believe they had this much hype for the show and blew it
It's insulting that they felt they had to use de-aging software on Hayden. The man looks literally no different than he did in Revenge of the Sith.
Hayden breathes once: The audience: 🐵🦁🐻🦊🐱🐼🐷🐦🐥🐣🦆🐼🐤🦅🦅🦅🦅
3:58 Obi-Wan Kenobi??? I think they meant Anakin Skywalker 😭😂
God bless you❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
hayden christensen, the kids miss u pooks
❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉fait péter le lenor unstopable 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Great actors...just love these guys
2 years since this beautiful moment ❤ I really miss the Kenobi era. It was a truly special time and this show means a lot to me, it was the return of Ewan and Hayden and Anakin and Obi Wan to live action after 17 years. I really miss Ewan and Hayden and I hope we see them again in more Star Wars series or movies. Dave Filoni needs to make a live action Clone Wars movie, Star Wars please!
"This is where the fun begins."
They need a season 2
“There’s good in you! There’s good man!” Had me dying 😂😂😂
And he's wearing ALL BLACK
If only the show was as good as these 2 are great actors.
Watchibg episode 1 in the movies as a kid was the best experience
you know Star Wars the Clone Wars and rebels are some Hell of series when even Hayden Christensen says how good it is
It took the awful sequels to make people realise just how good of a job Hayden did as Anakin.
🙋❤
The best Anakin Skywalker forever God save you  Hayden!!.
Give me a Darth Vader serie
that guy in the back has got some skill  with the light saber at 2:36
Such an awesome moment.  Too bad the show was more Disney trash
Hayden is a Vader losing in with Padme arms he darth Vader / anakin Skywalker
Dave filoni did great his stories in Star Wars, the clone wars, and all the Star Wars, but not tales of empire not right it’s torture jedi is rescue saved by the desert
Ewan McGregor is Ben Kenobi Obi Wan Kenobi that him as Ewan McGregor is Obi Wan Kenobi
People then: man can't wait for the new Kenobi series People now: 💀
Nice 5:36
Only for Hayden this man is a legend ❤
Here for Hayden he’s a legend ❤
Love these guys but that chase sequence with young Leia sucks so bad.
The Nerd in me from back in the early 90s to 00's where I was playing games and watching anime and all these Star Wars films is so happy. Everything has come full circle. Hayden was so underrated and I don't care what anyone says, to us, he and Ewan WERE STAR WARS during that time. They gave us a universe to immerse in.
When Hayden’s name popped up on screen it said he played obi-wan and darth Vader. Ummm he played anakin skywalker and darth Vader 😂😂
Great to see them together with the fans showing there love for these two. Just to bad the show was garbage
Beautiful man haha
Hayden Christianson genuinely seems like such a nice and appreciative person… I absolutely love it. Keep up the incredible work!!!
Aged very well
GOD THESE MEN DON'T LOOK LIEK THEY'VE AGED AT ALL So happy to see them meet like this
We can show you how it’s done dad now just relax liss that’s the jist of it
I think and hope they do it like this!!! 26or27 Chicago, 27or26 Orlando And then like it has been til now in order and we get Essen, Germany here🙏🙏  Japan was 2008 then 2xTimes Orlando and 2013 was Essen, Germany!! So I have a good feeling about this 😅 They only need to change one Orlando to Chicago.  I hope an pray for this every day 😂🙏  I cant attend Japan but want both in US and then hopefully not far from me here in Germany 🇩🇪 It would be a dream
These 2 guys shaped our childhoods man….
Both Hayden or Owen are casually wearing the colors or Anakin and Obi Wan
Hayden took this so well.  Of course, he is much older now so, it is a very different perspective. He comes across as so gracious. It’s wonderful.
Legends!
This is Our Lord Vader he just say One Word and People Chanting His Name like HE IS THE CHARMIEST GUY.
Even Ian
I will tell you the truth Vader is in the dark side even Anakin
Ewan McGregor is Kenobi obi wan
the second coming of christensen
I like how they are dress accordingly to their costume colors as Vader and Obi Wan!
After Ewan and Hayden version of star wars,it was the last good performance after star wars started to crumble and go down hill .Ewan and Hayden were the last jedis to make the star wars work.
I absolutely love Hayden's smile. I've started calling it the "infectious smile".
I was so excited waiting for the show to come out what a disaster 😭 they F up.
Man I can still remember when I was a little kid when my father bought a 6 in 1 dvd of star wars, and that is when I loved the show, even if I finished the series, I always watch over and over again and when my uncle bought me the very first xbox, it came with the game Star Wars Battlefront 2 and I was very very happy, the star wars franchise was very much attached with my life even until now. Always hated Anakin when I was a kid, but now I very loved him because I knew he did a very good job on role.
3:57 Apparently Hayden once played Obi-Wan Kenobi??? XD
8:33 what did he say?
Anakin is the best character
Some people didn't like Haydan as Anakin, but I thought I was a difficult role to take on. Having to play the pre Darth Vader and through story telling and acting to bring to life his character was a tough job. My hats off to Haydan for doing one hell of a job.
Ffs all that whooping and screaming.. 💩
❤❤❤
Remember how bad the obi wan show was?  Just trash
you tellin me they wanted to digitally de-age my man? neither of them look more than 3 years older then they were in the movies
4:41 ❤
9:41 😏
Can't believe it's been 20 years
I’m so happy for him<3
You lack conviction 🗿
The prequels were my childhood, growing up I had no idea adults hated and criticized them - to me they were and amazing and I have always loved them! I wish Jake Lloyd could feel how much people loved the movies, too, as much as these actors 😢
2:45 The guy that said 'aw yeah.' Haha.
the prequel and the clone wars ARE the best of star wars to gen z
Awesome to see them working together again ❤
the last scene was lit bro>>
These two amazing dude needs a movie of their own together. Not a Star Wars movie but something similar or adventure.. even comedy.
the guy spinning his lightsaber at 2:36 was crazy ngl
I'm not a huge star wars fan, only because it's just not my personal flavor i guess but I love the community for supporting Hayden after all the early 2000's BS he received
*takes a deep breath of relief  - Goood
so disrespectful of the audience to keep talking out like that
now they need Liam Neeson come out and say "Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi"
it sure doesnt feel like  20 years ago
I adore hayden, he deserves all the love for his work in this franchise, people in the past treated him wrong and i'm SO happy to see him getting the respect and love he deserves ;_; <3
You can really tell how George Lucas is a Legendary Film director because he literally showed us how he can bring a non fiction character to life.
Why is their chemistry together always so weird off of Star Wars? They are so awkward together it feels like. In most interviews I’ve seen
Why did they say attack of the clowns like there wasn’t a revenge of the sith
why is the host mega cringe
George lucas and company is a genius story teller and director
I don't think Hayden Christensen was the best actor at all in those movies, but honestly as a guy, he seems so humble and down to earth. Very likable guy.
uma ideia pra vcs faz um filme ou varios do dark vader e sucesso com certeza e um do mace windo so uma ideia  obrigado por produzir essas obras primas e por favor nao parem de fazer filmes
They should go everywhere with that theme 😂
As they’re on stage   Obi wan: “look Anikan now we both have the high ground”
HAYDEN EST FAIT POUR POUR ANAKIN
Make Starwars Great Again
ah yes, Obi Wan and Anakin :D this is where the fun begins!
You're like brothers...
I think maybe, because I was already in my 20's, I could see how well suited Anakin was cast. Hayden was absolutely perfect in the role. He spoke a LOT like Vader did in my childhood. And he gave Anakin/Vaders struggle the weight and depth it required.  It shocked me though how poorly he was treated with those films. Everybody coming into the original trilogy was NEW and we instantly loved or loved to hate them. It was different to me seeing the exact opposite.  FFWD all these years, and he is finally getting the respect and adoration he deserved the entire time. Is it because those kids have finally grown up, and seen him as they should have?
“There’s still good in you” outburst was by far the loudest and the best the reaction is well deserved and Hayden finishing it by saying “the thing” LEGEND
The best intro ever funny and still respectful that was dope I love this for both of them
2:37 dude in the back. That was clean.
Say the line Hayden.
It would have been so amazing if they had Natalie Portman here too.
What a DreamTeam🎉
Ewan is wearing brown and white Jedi colors Hayden is dressed in all black like a sith I love it
Thats propably the best thing that came out of the Obi Wan Show...  I just wish they would have hired some trained monkeys to write it, instead of these amoebas they have in the "Story Group" right now
They walked out holding the Mic's like Lightsaber Hilts 😂
Episode three is the best, then Empire.
The colour patterns of their choice of clothing match the ones they wore in the films. Ewan with Obi's Jedi Master robes brown and white and Hayden with Anakins darker attire
I’m surprised that the crowd didn’t cheers when Hayden coughed.
123 >>>>>>>>>>>789
2:37 that lightsaber flip tho
You can tell Hayden is socially awkward and Ewon is the talker.
I was in 7th grade when Revenge of the Sith came out. I never understood the hate Hayden got. To me, he was Anakin Skywalker. I am so glad the fanbase has turned around and accepted him and he's gotten the love he should have always had. George Lucas cast him for a reason. He IS Anakin Skywalker.
"You were like a brother to me."  "I hate you."   I love you both so much.
We were either too young or too blind to see how good Hayden was and how good episode 3 was.
We love you Anakin ❤
how tf is hayden still this good looking, its been like 20 years
Their hair man!
love ewan let hayden have his moments!! two humble gentlemen were all i saw!!
Hayden is a decent actor, the hate on him was ridiculous! It wasn't his fault, the script he was given was wooden.
“This time we’ll take him together”
When's Ewan going to get addicted to heroin and get filmed for a documentary giving it up in a crappy flat using the stuff he used in trainspotting to do it? He's so cool isn't he?
These men will never be forgotten..so many generations have and will discover the Star Wars Universe and fall in love with just as I did, you, and our parents…
Hayden is to SW what Cavill is to The Witcher. Keep making stuff with as much Anakin as possible, love Haydens portrayal of Anakin/Vader.
God bless Hayden Christensen ❤
Nice outfit choices
I love Hayden Christensen. He's evolved enormously as an actor and his performances in both Kenobi and Ashoka gave me goosebumps.
Going from the most hated character to the most loved. The force works in mysterious ways...
Masters 🎉🔥
Meu deus, eu iria chorar tanto. Que encontro, que encontro. Só faltou a natalie portman. Espero que ela volte a saga SW.
The series was sooooo good can't wait for the next one
How dope would it have been if they wore something to resemble their characters… not their full wardrobe but something that represents it
Hayden even walks like Anakin.
Bro was sweating through his suit
Ewan McGregor is 50 years old, let that sink in. Dose this dude even age?
Ewan and Hayden are just plain BROs!
this warms my heart 😭
It would have been awesome if they came out lightsaber dueling up to the stage
Even after all these years I still am crushing over Hayden 😂😂😂
This is incredible
Walking out like absolute sigmas.
Para mi siempre lo hiciste bien Hayden y siempre seras anakin.
It warms me heart seeing how much love hayden and ewan get.  They deserve the world from my perspective, star wars saved me from a dark place.
should've done more their faces on star wars were the best it's so sad they didn't do more honestly they made strar wars way bigger then it was
Always master and apprentice
As a child i genuinely looked up to this actor and his performances from life as a house, jumper and of course star wara. He was always bery relatable for me. And it always felt like watching an older brother. His wholesomness irl is also awesome.
Unlistenable
The man shouted: You were like brothers.......
The guy in the back, flipping the lightsaber was pretty cool. @2:38
Funny how they're outfits' colour scheme match their outfits in RotS.
Ewan and Hayden ARE Obi-Wan and Anakin/Vader. There can be no others.
What did he yell at 5:36 ?
Hayden has aged like maybe one year in the past 20 years lol
The more I see HC in interviews, the more and more I really like the guy.  Humble, quiet, seemingly uninterested in Hollywood nonsense a la Henry Cavill.  The role of Vader could only be done once, you get one shot at it, and I think over time, ppl will realize that he was perfect for the role.
His uncle was in a new hope?
1:23. Check out that guy on the left inferior corner taking a whole bunch of pictures
Hayden has become a Rock Star🙂
Hayden is truly the choosen one
dual of the fates has to be one of the best pieces of music ever written for a film score.
I love you Hayden. Thanks you from Slovakia
Fun fact: Hayden was filming Ahsoka around this time. His hair should've given it away.
Right there is the generation of youngling who all would of joined Lord Vader
It’s a blessing and a curse that the crowd is so nuts.
Whomever put the characters under their names messed up. Hayden was Anakin, not Obi
No believable emotions from them AT ALL...
As much of a disappoint the show was, this has to be culturely the biggest 'IYKYK' moment
coool
That has to be the worst introduction ever
Man, Ewan and Hayden haven't aged a single day!
a new hooooope
2:37 bro flipping lightsaber behind, I tried. Hit my head twice
My Feelings are, I Loved the Prequels All the Way Back when they First Came Out as Well as the Originals and Still Do! I Think that Both Trilogies were Extreamly Great just in Different Ways! And I Still Love Them Just as Much Now as I Did Then! But, as for the Sequels, Let Me Just Say👎 I Never Blame the Actors, They're Just Doing There Jobs, and a Darn Good Job Too. They Should Always Be Commended! It's the Ones In Charge of Making All the Decisions and Deciding What to Do and what Not to Do that is to Blame for a Movie Failing!  And in My Book the Sequels Failed, BIG TIME!!! But I Love the Stuff that Came Before and Some of What Came After!👍❤
This put a smile on my face😊
Merecemos una serie live action de la guerra de los clones
Hayden and his Clone Wars hair.  lol love it.  No wonder he watched all of Clone Wars and Rebels 🙂
🔥💎🔥
4:29 you can clearly see Anakin using the force to shush the crowd
Little did we know this isn’t all we would get of more hayden 🥳🥳🥳🥳
"Game time started"
I wanna know what people were yelling at all points 😂
They even wore light and dark outfits lol
2:35 homeboy in the background got some moves
This deadass makes me so happy
Just noticed now that they're wearing their respective Jedi colours. That's awesome.
hayden got the darth drip
George Lucas is to blame for all the wooden acting in the prequels. Hayden really got destroyed by fans for a long time to the point of him not wanting to act anymore. I read Star Wars was actually a near career ruiner due to the backlash. I am so happy Hayden is getting another chance to show how good he can be in this role under different hands. Ewan is amazing in everything he does and I am happy he came back to this role too.
2:44 look at the guy behind these two actors that guy performed a cool trick. Lol
❤️❤️❤️
You cannot tell me that they did not color coordinate coming out with Ewan in the traditional brown/white of the Jedi and Hayden rocking all black
Plz starwars clonewar and bad batch plz Hindi dubb series
They deserved a much better script! 😏
over a year and a half later and i only just know realized there clothing is similar to obi-wan and vader
Now that we have seen ghost Anakin in Ahsoka we need atleast one scene with Obi wan and Anakin just talking as force ghosts
Obnoxious audience...
3:45 - Anyone here after Ahsoka Episode 5?  * * * * You can really tell that he took the animated characteristics to heart. He played the perfect live-action Clone Wars Anakin.
I’m so happy Hayden is getting the love he deserves
Hayden proved that he is The Chosen One after the last episode of Ahsoka episode! The line is now blurred between the animated Anakin and live action.
Hayden did an amazing role as anikan.  He really brought the conflict anikan had to life. He was born to be Darth Vader.  Great job Hayden you are a legend!!
Rockstars🎤
Addias and nike🎸 singers
Hayden. Hayden. Hayden. Period.
Man, he looks like he doesn't age a day...
It’s amazing to see the two together . If I was Ewan, my first word to break the ice would have been “Hello there!”
I'm genuinely so happy for Hayden. He deserves it!  I want to see a Jumper 2. That movie is so underrated.
❤❤❤beautiful this IS where the fun begins
I loved how ewan came out 8nt brown and white and hayden came out in black mirros their characters
It was so intense the story of how Anakin transformed into Negan!
Am I the only one who found the audience’s practice of screaming their heads off every 5 seconds incredibly irritating? I want to actually hear their answers!
At 4:00 Hayden Christensen Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi  Someone messed up.
At least there's one good actor on that stage.
I Iove theese guys :D
9:40
Hayden you're awesome
Funny that they fit their outfits colors to the ones they wear in the movies or maybe it's a coincidence
I'ved always loved the prequels the first sequels Ewan and Hayden and Sam Jackson Ian Mcdermond this my childhood
Let me get that canter piece
I love Hayden so much
Most of this video is just shouting
I'm so excited
The public is so annoying
The fans would have freaked out if Ewan had said "Hello there" right at the beginning.
tha fact that, ewan got jedi clothes and hayden sith clothes
it says he plays darth vader and obi wan??? 3:56
❤❤❤❤❤its the circle of coruscant ❤❤❤❤❤❤the kyber eternal light ❤❤❤❤❤❤
The clone war helped
How they gonna get a host who hasn't seen revenge of the switch 😂
If anybody wants to create a list about why Hayden Christensen was a bad Anakin and tell me how long and distinguished it is guess what Hayden haters: So is my Johnson.  Hayden did excellent at his role of Anakin Skywalker in the prequel trilogy.
I love Ewan and Hayden. I'm glad to see them together again
Hayden!!!
Oh my goodness HAYDEN he still does look the same 20 years ago so HANDSOME yeah awesome . ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I love those movies
I love them both so much my hero’s
I've never seen so many virgins.
When Hayden said thank you to the fans he really felt embraced like never before! He probably been wanting this reaction for years and he got it! We really appreciate you Hayden! Best anakin/Vader ever!
At he 2005 ending they showed us darth vader but never saw him in action. This show with ewan and hayden will do that to make up for the void they left in the cliffhanger ending.
They literally did not age
Hayden:"This is where the fun beggins!" Ewan:"...I STILL hate flying!"
Give Hayden a huge role in new movies man he’s so charismatic
This is where the fun begins.....  Crowd:YEEEEAAAHHH
They both aged so well too…I love when my childhood hero’s still look the same as they did all those years ago 🥹
These two do not age.  They look the exact same from when they were in ROTS
I love how they both respect each other man, they’re literally like obi wan and anakin.
I cried shut up and wach it again
😻😻😻
It's a delight to see those two getting the applause they deserve after 20 years, which they didn't have at the time.
Hayden finally getting the respect and love he deserves genuinely brings a tear to my eye.
Just noticed im watching this on May 26th and the video is from May 26th
"she directed all of the episodes, its her singular vision throughout". Yup that makes so much sense
we love hayden
He perfectly plays Darth Vader
Ewan’s rocking the Jedi mind tricks!
and than the show ended up being a complete joke
Literal goose bumps. ❤
sucks the show sucked
Those people at the time Revenge of the Sith released were like me just kids who couldn’t voice out their love for Hayden. I for my part were always a great fan of his and how he portrayed Anakin, the emotions he conveyed through his gestures and facial expressions. The dialogue were bad but the rest was epic.
Nice to see Obi-Wan and Anakin/ Vader together again. I go way back to 1977 "A New Hope" I was a fan then and still am now. Hayden was a favorite when the prequels came out.
Take a moment to appreciate de dude flipping his saber in the back at 2:37
2:36 no one gonna talk about that great saber flip with that guy in the back ground. Man that was skill
Why is he sayign and butching ewans names with uuuuuwhennn, like the hell does that make sense?! Obnoxious af
There is a lightsaber master at the background 2:37!
2:37 dude was slick with it
lol ewan has an infectious smile.   Guy in the back stfu
Aren't they surprised about everyone loving the prequels now?
The host is traaash haha
Bro literally lives for it 🤣 2:22
2:37 Can we take a minute to respect this guy’s lightsaber skills in the back 👀
I absolutely love the fact that they're wearing suits which resemble Obi-Wan and Anakin's Jedi robes respectfully, nice touch
When that guy yelled ‘we missed you’ you can tell he got Hayden in the heart with that one
Are you here to destroy me Obi Wan?
Ewan dressed in Jedi colours and Hayden dressed in Vader colours.
The host makes this interview awkward
His voice is so Anakin❤❤❤❤❤❤ i missed when anny is with padme❤
It'd be nice to find H.C. a place in the MCU.
When your friend is busy trying to catch you up on their life, and you're just happy to see them again.
Their wardrobe was clearly inspired by their characters
I'm a 2000's kid who has born EXACTLY in 2000...  I wasn't able to watch the Episodes 1 and 2 yet so that makes Episode 3 my very first Star Wars movie and through that I was able to watch the prequels thanks to my parents who were a BIG Star Wars fan.... What a moment to live in those time <3
Hayden is so finnneeee
Pretty sure 80% prequel memes comes from these two
Wedge is  the  uncle to ewan McGregor  one of the best  actors in this saga
Wow what an incredible human being. Obi Wan Kenobi has finally given him the chance to see what he deserves <3
Hello there meme was great😊
These two are popular characters but the most popular character would be the son of Hayden's character.  Disney refuses to promote their most popular character because they do not like money and in a capitalistic society you need money to survive.
It is an amazing show that needs a SEASON 2....and a SEASON 3 if possible
People who diss the prequels don't get it man, star wars doesn't just belong to one generation, each of us has a core childhood memory watching in awe of the new movies on the big screen. It's beyond eras and phases, that's what the prequels are about!
:;
Give this man (Hayden) his own tv show !
don't sit down before ur guests dumbass, this interviewer sucks
I love how people care about Hayden Christensen’s character rather than just James Earl Jones. Because at the end, we all have to agreed that Anakin Skywalker has always been the most popular antihero in the face of the universe.
I'm glad he got redeemed. Everyone deserves love...
they  made hayden beloved, after decades of hate, hayden is now an icon that he long deserved to be
You know, I imagine how Ewan must be so happy for Hayden to have this second chance. Because Ewan was, and still is, an A-lister. But Hayden just vanished off the map - mostly because of the hate he got and how much the movies did a disservice to his abilities. You can see in their joint interviews that Ewan tries to subtly highlight that folks should keep an excited eye out for Hayden on this show.
2:38 some random guy spinning a lightsaber like a pro
Hayden Christensen Shows & Movies 1. Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader - Star Wars Obi-Wan Kenobi, Episode 2 Attack of the Clones, Episode 3 Revenge of the Sith, Episode 9 The Rise of Skywalker 2002 - 2005 - 2019 - 2022
Can you feel the FAKE DISNEY HYPE???   Let's hear it for the 2 guys that ruined Star Wars!    Make sure you cheer really loud!!
The only good thing about the new trilogy was making us appreciate how good the prequel trilogy was. Now Hayden can get all the love he deserves.
9:13 “WE MISS YOU” *HAYDEN SMILES* 🥹
Hayden is 41 now. thas craazy man
Dang the duel of fates playing in the background gives me chills
These guys are awesome.
Tudo que vejo é Obi wan e Anakin dando uma maravilhosa entrevista após terem vencido as guerras clonicas
Before they go on stage Ewan: we’ll do this together Hayden: I was just about to say that
I like how Ewan was wearing brighter clothing and Hayden was wearing darker clothing just cements the idea of how much they respect these characters they portrayed.
They should of came out dueling
Hayden🙌🙌
The way they walk to the music is insane
These two can fill a football stadium JUST for an interview. Easily.
They need to replace Anthony as a host. He's lame
''You know what happens at the end of the revenge of the sith''   ''Don't tell me , I haven't seen it yet'' What is that guy doing there?
Love them!
To see Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen return to Star Wars brought me happy tears 🥲. They did amazing performances in Obi Wan Kenobi 🙂
Hayden was amazing in Shattered Glass!
Dang bro they look like in real obi wan and Anakin
Jesus the audience had no chill lol wild
I’m only watching this again because Hayden said it
😭❤️
I hope Hayden knows how much so many of us love him as Anakin and Darth Vader🫶🏼
We can finally see both of them again
These characters couldn't have been portrayed on screen any better by anyone alive, I believe. The critics at the time did them both a great disservice.
I live in Sydney Australia
I hate this more than sand... In fact, sand is fine..
I don’t think Hayden understands how much we love him and what a great job he really did with such a tough role to fill. Through the roof love and excitement for that man. Him and Ewan’s chemistry and conflict as brothers was absolutely unforgettable.
EPISODE 3 HAS BEEN THE BEST STAR WARS FILM TO DATE. Thank you Hayden and Ewan especially!!!!!!
yes, she is
Galaxy brothers 💙💙, and my dear and tender Hayden 😍😍❤❤
Happy Birthday Ewan McGregor. UR awesome legend. Black Hawk Down is freaking awesome. Soldier Movies r great. And I loved Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace. Me and my 2 brothers.

Ok but why is no one talking about the sick saber flip at 2:32
Hayden is Michael Jackson shy when it comes tp interviews and large crowds, lol. Good to see him getting the love
Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen  OUTFIT AS JEDI AND VADER OUT FIT COLOR LOL
He did an amazing anakin skywalker and I knew it was just a matter of time for haters and other people to recognize the level of the prequels.  thanks disney for the trash you created  to accelerate the process 😂
2:37 the guy in the background with red saber
Prequels are better than the original just facts
these 2 ARE my childhood. Quoting every line, reenacting every fight scene.. i loved their growth and friendship long after the movies.
09:40
meeting Hayden this weekend!
That day, Star Wars fans came through.
Who else thinks Ewan McGregor should have opened up with HELLO THERE and then Hayden should have followed it up with this is where the fun begins
The guy in the background at 2:37 tho :O
9:39
I’d absolutely love to meet these 2 so much.
That a one and only Chosen One
it's just so sad that this show wasn't that good , but all the scenes with hayden and ewan were phenomenal
I finally watched these movies with my kids.  Loved every second of it.
The way Hayden made all of his movements as Vader so aggressive and angry he frickin nailed it!
I love how Ewan is dressed in brown/white and Hayden in fully black. They really are Obiwan and Anakin at heart.
Hayden finally getting the love he deserves !
Star wars episode 3 is the best movie ever made I love it
Under Hayden name they placed (Darthvader and Obi Wan).  Am I missing something?
look at Hayden, he is so humble and polite, he is very happy to recieve all love from the audience and from us :)
I've always loved Hayden as Anakin. I grew up on the prequels and I didn't even know people hated him until social media came around and I was genuinely shocked by it. I am SO happy Hayden is getting the love he deserves!!
Now if only these fans could give Jake Lloyd the same recognition, as he too was treated very poorly by fans and schoolmates alike after the release of The Phantom Menace.
Crazy fans
So crazy😅 i don't even have the feeling of Ewan and Hayden sitting there.. more like Obi Wan and Anakin.. they are truly the only actors who could play them
So happy to see them together again!!
I love these guys, they work so well together and work so hard to bring their characters to life! More than any other duo, Hayden and Ewan were (And still are) my heroes growing up!
He looks really good for 50
This was basically a show for the black inquisitor. We barely saw ani or Vader
The Obi Wan show was awful....
2 Legends bro
To see the two of them walk out onto stage, Ewan in a classy brown and white attire and Hayden in a black suit, makes me think it was either planned or they have adopted the styles and become modernized versions of their characters. Truly wonderful either way
I LOVE that they dressed like their outfits as jedis but casual
I just realised, the suit ewan is wearing is the same colours as his jedi robes and Hayden the same but also its Vader's suit colour
Anybody who gave Hayden hate back in the day just didn't understand. Anakin becomes darth vader, you don't become one of the most evil characters in the universe without being a little mentally unstable but Hayden played the role so well of someone whos mentally unstable. I'll admit I didn't exactly love Hayden right from the beginning of episode 2 but I never hated him and by the end of episode 3 I honestly believed they couldn't have found a better actor to play the role. Im just so glad more people nowadays understand how talented he really is. Especially all the choreography he did in the saber battles.
All this hype for such a disappointment of a show
Just before Hayden said it, we all knew his punchline
So we are not gonna talk about this guy in the back in 2:35
id love to see a Vader show
the season was amazing, and I love how the "timeline holes" in the franchise are getting filled!
Les deux acteurs Erwan mc Gregor et Hayden Christensen sont magnifiques dans l'emission et ils sont adorables dans l'emission .
its really crazy how they still lookk the same aged like fine wine
2:37 Actually nice show off buddy xD
9:30 - when you know you're a meme, and you totally accept it. Iconic.
I Love this❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bravo, They did an awesome job on the show cant wait for Season 2 and the Asohka Show
Two icons that will live forever
Star Wars fans love these guys...period.
The legends never die
I just want to say that I let a very few men in my life and one of them resembled Hayden's face and I just went for him because he looked like my childhood crush from Star Wars 🥲 to this day Anakin is still in my heart omggg his performance in Obi Wan made me cry!!! Can't wait for his turn on Ahsoka!!!
hayden ❤
when you realize maul is silently imposing himself with duel of the fates there
Wow , even with two golden raspberries for his roles Hayden is the legend. Because people UNDERESTIMATE HIS POWER
Who else thought the people cheering the back was annoying
We all got hyped for the show but sadly it flopped
Does Ewan ever age?
Perfect music for them to walk on stage
this is one of the many reasons 2022 was epic.
Let's not pretend like this isn't what everyone bought their ticket to see
No one can replace Hayden as Anakin.
They had no idea how big of an impact the final episode is going to make. Both fans & actors.
Fun fact Ewan and I have the same birthday!
So happy to see Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen  back in Star Wars, legends, so many childhood memories with the prequel trilogy ❤️
I love Hayden is my favorit actor ❤️
We need a high budget solo obi wan and anakin movie between 2 and 3
Caaallll meeeee Hayden
So lucky people were there sooo lucky.
I m so very happy for Hayden my love 😘😘😘😘😘💋💋💋💋❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰💖💖💖💖he is so very sexy sweet man my sweetheart ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘😘
I’m glad that these guys are finally getting the appreciation they deserve, and finally feeling the love from the generation of fans who truly loved those films… I’m glad the bitter gate keepers aren’t the only voices being heard anymore… this interview put a smile on my face.  Ewan and Hayden did an amazing job on this new series and on the prequel films. The last fight scene between obi wan and Vader, when vaders mask gets slashed open was quite possibly one of the greatest scene in stars war’s history in my opinion
This Vs Kathleen Kennedy walking out is hilarious
My friends dad got him the whole star wars story up to the prequel trilogy on blue ray, we watched them all the time
Hayden is great! Such an underrated actor.
Привет Американским фанатам от Русских фанатов. Я не понимаю что значит эта реплика его в конце и где она использовалась.
3:01 completely forgot revenge of the sith was filmed in Australia.  As an Aussie fan who wasn’t born then, this makes me happy
Let's go!
I'm so so happy he's receiving all the love he deserved for the prequels. How can u hate a man like this? Hayden is such a talented actor, Hopefully I can meet him one day!!! He delivered that line so well brought me right back to the prequels, favorite trilogy!
Lol this audience do not know the meaning of quiet xD
9:40 When Ashoka turns 18
These two are precious
I really love having played Duel of Fates as Ewan and Hayden enters the stage 🔥
What Saddens me about this is how much Kathleen Kennedy let down these two phenomenal actors and their friendship and brotherhood, that show should have been a movie and it should have been 100% Star wars. Instead of generic overly fluffed bad writing it just.... how could she do this again? how could she do another Jake Skywalker treatment on one of these beloved characters?. She doesn't belong in there she has no idea what Star wars is or what it's about and she should go nowhere near Star wars ever again.
I’ve been pronouncing Hayden‘s last name wrong all this time 😂
I loved Star Wars so much more before everybody knew about it, now it's everywhere in everything it's too much
Honestly my childhood heroes still
The host is terrible.
Hahaha Reveg of the sit
met Ewan in Boston this past Aug, had the same white pants on that he does here. he said "Hello there" to me, the circle is complete!!
star wars is about the story of anakin skywalker, we need more content with the character
disney please upload more anakin scene
Good to see hayden back
they did not age a bit
His portrayal of Anakin was perfect. Those that gave him so much hate have warm temperature IQ's with the emotional intelligence of chalk. Exactly how did one expect his character to act being brought up the way he did?
i wanted Ewan to say hello there as they walked in so bad
As disappointing as the show was..  I don't blame Ewan or Hayden.  They did the best they could with what they were given
It's so good to see Hayden back
why’d you have to bring up the sand :/ that was rude.he’s been shamed about it for so long
Please. Not more Woke. Please. Not more Disney politics. Please. More Star Wars.
Anyone else noticed they are wearing there colors Ewan with the brown and white and hayden with the all black
Star wars, at least classic like star wars unites its main charavyers like family in real life. I only wish we could get to see more of these 2 have wholesome scenes in live action
Hayden really needs this love after the prequels. So excited he gets to see some true Star Wars fans celebrating his role as Anakin.
Idk if the sand comment was necessary
you rock
All of the Star Wars sequels sucked.
"This is where the fun begins" iconic
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
That 5:36 ' you were like brothers'😂
Talk about a star wars implosion. Kenobi needs to go away. Darth afraider was useless.
I was there and hadn't had anything to eat in 24 hours so I went outside to get a burger and as I was sitting there, scrolling through instagram, I saw that Ewan and Hayden were on the live stage. I immediately ran over there but they had already left and been replaced by Deborah Chow. I still can't believe I missed this because I have to eat to survive 🤦🏽‍♀️
Legends!
I hate the fact these two amazing actors are being used by Disney to bate fans to watch a subpar show. It sucks because i really wanted kenobi to be good and it frustrates me how bad it was.
This movie was such a big part of my childhood man. I watched the Star Wars 3 DVD over and over again when I wasn't playing with the action figures. Thanks for the good memories guys. Such iconic Star Wars characters!
9:40
First Andrew and tobey return to Spider-Man. Now Hayden returns as Vader. Life has worked out well
Most interviews Hayden does you can tell he is trying to soak everything in and how grateful he is to the fans........
2:21 - Ewan doesn't care about anyone. He was just enjoying the moment. I just love him
what a disgrace that they got the guys back for such a terrible show
I think ewan meant in 2005
WHY DON'T THEY HAVE LIGHTSABER MICS !!!
Man, I wish I was there
hyped ;D
great actors I was moved to see them together and the public loves them
That guy in 2:38 though
I remember as a 9 year old in 1977 ,going to the cinema and watching the very first Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope and Sir Alec Guinness was Obi wan. Gawd how times have changed.
2:37 guy in back lol
4:24 was so awesome. Finally he was able to see the love we fans have for him!
the fans always making so much noise and interrupting the speakers 😆  God I love these two.
just recently gotten into star wars, and just found out abt the amount of hate the prequels had gotten back then. it's amazing and bittersweet to see the love ewan and hayden deserved, given to them now :']
HAYDN YOU DESERVE EVERYTHING!!
He looks so shy
Hallo There!😎
Anyone see the man at 2:39 with some lightsaber skills
Hayden and Ewan were the only reasons the show was bearable sadly. It was poorly directed.
The best performance of star wars is of them two in episode III.  Hope to see more flashback scenes of Anakin and obi wan.
and i am soo soo happy for hayden
Besides the 1970-80s originals, this was hands down THE BEST Star Wars series ever made. I’m seeing a few comments here and there saying it had mixed reviews and I seriously don’t see how that’s even possible.
All those critics from 20 years ago are being awfully quiet 🙂 congratulations Hayden, youve deserved this for a long time. You finally showed us Darth Vader in his most terrifying form that everybody has anxiously wanted to see for almost 50 years now. May the force be with you 💙❤️💜
2:37 AYO WHOSE THAT NINJA
Can the audience just shut it?
9:37 I love how Hayden looks at Ewan with a smile, like "watch this bud, this is gonna be awesome" So cool
2003? Rots came out in 2005
the crowd is just trollin at this point lmao
everyone constantly trying to repeat the "you're breathtaking" moment is cringe and annoying LET THE MAN TALK
99% of the comment section - “I’m glad Hayden is getting love now, he used to always get so much hate.”   By the way, I’m glad Hayden is getting love now. He’s awesome. 😅😏
Disney please upload more anakin scenes.
Hayden is the chosen one!
was the money worth your souls?
Anakin ❤️
I love Ewan as ObiWan. Hope to see more of this duo.
I'll always love him from Moulin Rouge 😍
Hayden and Ewan so happy to seem them get the support they deserve
met Ewan last month, he said "hello there " to me. just about died!
Ewan McGregor: "We made those movies, and I never thought 20 years later I'd be coming back." Harrison Ford: "Get used to it, kid. You may want out, but they never let you go."
Imagine if the first thing Hayden said when he sat down was “This is where the fun begins” I would’ve shrieked!!
9:40
So glad Hayden is back, very very happy
Hayden is amazing!!!!
5:36 “You were my brother!”
9:41 What you came for!
Hayden and Ewan both were wearing clothes that matches their outifts in the series. Ewan with brown jacket and white pants mirroring Obi Wan's robe and Hayden with all black suit just like Vader.
their outfit match their costume.
There's a sith in the background 2:36
Dude forget about the actors look at that guy in the background with the lightsaber like sheeesh 🥶🥶🥶 2:33
I'm going to sound like an echo, but I'm glad Hayden is getting the love these days.
SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII HAYDEN SIGUE JOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
The first 3 minutes it’s just the crowd cheering and screaming lol
I always loved the prequels. I never knew they got this much hate. It was the prequels that got me hooked into star wars!
So glad Hayden is back !
2.7m views but only 15K likes? cmon guys
Fun fact: Hayden Christensen saw a kid after this, off cam he immediately started saying "Good Jedi Follow Orders" and then Jedi'd the kid
Bruh you could start World Peace from this room it’s electric and magnetic
8:50 "THERES GOOD IN YOU!!" Lmaooooo 😂
Hayden in all black. Ewan in brown. Can’t be coincidence
So happy for Hayden. Finally the credit he deserves ❤️
I like how they wore the same colour clothes of their Star Wars role
Bruh we need more of these guys
I love star wars for  the 2000 's movies😌
I love  Hayden  from first time I saw him to the last time of my life
I FEEL LIKE WE NEED A JUMPER 2
we only see hayden's profile.....weird
2:38 I know this is about Hayden and mcgregor but props to the one guy spinning his saber
As a young kid in a small town in India. I didn't get to watch the Star wars prequel series in a theatre.These were pre-social media days and Hollywood movies were restricted to Metropolitan cities.I learnt of Star Wars from a channel called Star Movies which broadcasted great Hollywood blockbusters. There was this movie marathon of Star wars and I was all pumped up to watch the trilogy on the go but the providence had other things in store. There was an 18-20 hour loss in electricity transmission (yes those were the days we were grappling with power cuts, India today is much better) and I bawled my eyes out. Now I just watch reruns on my laptop! Nostalgia hits you hard...
My dream see you obi-wan😔
Their hairstyles looks similar to Revenge of the Sith not sure if y'all caught on to that 🤔😄😂
god i love these two
Maybe if people loved Hayden from the start he wouldn't have turned to the dark side smh
Dear god…. That line has always done something to me
meeting ewan next weekend can't wait!
Hayden’s “this is where the fun begins” was the best part of the whole interview. I cheered. Wow. That gave me chills. They were both phenomenal in Kenobi.
They steald the show from others
Im glad Hayden is back and part of the series.  More Sith content in the Star Wars universe is always welcome.
Who wants a live action clone wars show with these two?
I could'nt hear them too much as the audience would'nt shut up.
I wish Hayden Christensen plays X-O Manowar in the Valiant Cinematic Universe
I feel like 50%of this was the crowd screaming and cheering
Glad to see my bro Hayden is finally getting the respect he deserves from the fans
9:40 this is where the fun begins
help me jar jar binks, youre my only hope
I like this one better
And man.....after watching those episodes, Hayden bro!  You weren't lying    "This is where the fun begins"  Hayden Christensen SWCA 2022
so cool they were a brown and a black jacket, get it
i have a father too once in march 27 - 28 1948 my dad
I simply love them.
Hayden Christensen is my favorite actor he is cool
3:40 ....and of course a lot of idiots recording videos on portrait mode.......
I love you
Hello There! 👋😊
you are me brother !! que bien que estuvo ahi! jajajajaj!!! epico
How hysterical is this crowd. Pretty anoying to watch a clip that contains of 75%  audience shouting..
Viewers: man Youtube recommendations are being boring lately   Kenobi Clips: *Hello There!*
So glad Hayden found himself as an everyday man...  Now... He can truly say. "This is where the fun begins..."
But people did not know then, that there will be no iconic and exciting music at all, in the new series. And neither will we hear the original Star Wars themes.Sad. But they were lovely and they look so much younger real life than in the film! Amazing!
That guy in the background at 2:37 though
now everybody loves hayden.  when i was a kid i am already a fan.  what a bandwagon idiots.
This is where the fun begins 09:26
Remember how everyone hated Hayden as Darth? Now everyone loves him
Loving the two of them so much, loving this interview, loving the audience and excitement ❤❤❤
I like how Hayden is wearing anakin colors and ewan is wearing obiwan colors
Es revivir mi infancia 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩, que la fuerza los acompañe
Hayden: is there any kids here by chance
I cant belive people who hate or hated the prequels. Revenge of the Sith is my absolute favourite Star Wars movie! I went home in shock after that one.   Much love to two Star Wars legends ❤
I really hope Hayden gets some big roles again, he really is a good actor.
0:36 to just be there to experience the hype of this moment.  these guys were just a huge part of my childhood
Hayden still looks extremely  stunning!  Love his curly wavy hair🙂
im glad hayden is getting the respect he deserves for this role. finally.
This one was must needed series 🙌 they made it so good 👏 loved both of them such a good actors 👏thank you to the incredible fans and these actors for keeping star wars alive ❤️
i need hayden
It's incredible - the power of movies. Just seeing these two actors stand side to side instantly brings me back to my childhood.
when they guy yelled "there's good in you" I lost it
Where can I watch the animated series?
Não entendi nada sou do Brasil
I’m so happy for Hayden. He seems like such a genuinely nice person. It’s so unfortunately he was treated so poorly by critics and fans in the trilogy. He was so young and had no real experience. It was really wasn’t fair to give him such a hard time when it was the script and writing that really hurt those films. Looking back, he did an really good job, all things considered, especially in Revenge of the the Sith.
Hayden Christensen sounds like Clone Wars Anakin nowadays and it feels so weird yet so good. If he sounded like this back then, he probably could've made the dialogue tolerable.
Nerds everywhere went wild
Berbat bir senaryoydu. Hiç edilmiş hayden in dönüşü. 2-3 kısa sahne dışında geri kalanı hiç çekmeseler daha iyiymiş
This Is Why I Love Star Wars
We're allowed to like them because they are white men. I hope Star Wars learned their lesson and only has white male characters from now on, so that they can avoid offending the right-wing snowflakes.
That episode of goosebumps tho 👌
sadly it turned out to be such a bad series :(
09:40
My man rocking Iron Rangers.
Has anyone else noticed that Hayden actually is starting to sound more like Matt Lanter's Anakin? Something very interesting. I'm happy for the guy
honestly this is probably a shock to them as episodes 1 - 3 originally weren't well received among fans at the time vs  4 - 6. but now all of us that have grown up with 1 - 3... we kinda out weigh the older fans, it also helps that there were a few bad... starwars games/shows that put them in higher status now.
It feels like Hayden is scared to be happy b/c he's been 💩 on for so long
People from 2003 seeing all the young people love the prequels: "You were supposed to destroy the prequels, not love them!"
9:41😍😍
2:40 pm 9satrdiwk1-2,6tyhdi/july7thmnth/2022... 3001 gntlly blvd 70122 ... 160 mn af5rnun.... 30 23 16 n9 2july satrdi..
I'm glad they found Hayden in the hole he's been hiding in for the last two decades.
They don’t know how to handle the nerds lmao
Is it 2022? Are we really seeing Ewan and Hayden back together again? Part of me still thinks I'm dreaming
Goosebumps
i have an insane crush on Hayden that i cant get over -not ashamed to admit it
So glad with the love these 2 are getting now I've always thought they deserved it!
Protect Hayden and Ewan at all costs 😭 I love them so muchhhh ❤️
the crowd was so overwhelming that they couldn't even give long responses lol
How unrespectful is this audience.  Shut up and let them talk.
Wow obi wan and anakin managed to peacefully sit right next to eachother for this interview
All these people ask the same questions...I guess there is nothing else to draw from for questions
8:21  I said "use my knowledge, i beg you"
Doesn't it look like Ewan McGregor's nose is broken?
Those guys fit the characters perfectly and I never understood hate for Hayden. Now people finally love him and I am happy I always did. They really made something awesome.
Haydennnn ❤️
Hayden Christensen is Anakin Skywalker Nobody else . Couldn't picture anybody else in that role. We missed him
is nobody going to talk about those epic saber moves from the sith in the background at 2:37?
doesnt matter what some of the haters say about this obi one series overall it is pretty good with a banger final episode,wel so far final episode not shure of there wil be more.
That's awesome
They look like their dressed similar to their jedi garments
Half of this video is cheering
They have aged 5 years in 20 wow
Ewan is such a legend love him
Love how there clothes match there characters Jedi robes
Thank You to all the fans that were there that day and showed Hayden all that love. I had tears in my eyes when they started to shout his name 🥺. He deserves all that love, honestly we were kids when the prequels came out and didn't have much of a voice. Now we do and we love the prequels. Please y'all do not let these so call fans turn you off from the show. The show is amazing, they literally just want to nit pick at everything. Y'all please let's not let those toxic fans get to Hayden again. He doesn't deserve it, he did amazing ❤
I see that James Earl Jones speaks for Darth Vader again. A voice that is now 45 years old.  How much longer can he go?  He must be in his 90's now.
❤️ you both so much!!!
Ewan didnt start with Hello There...
Se parece tanto a Mel Gibson, hasta en los gestos
Hayden coming with his own meme is gold
If I were ewan I'd start the talk with "hello there~"
When the first movie of this trilogy came out I was 17 and 23 by the time the third movie came out. My only complain about Anakin was about the poor script they gave Hyden to work with. I found his Anakin a flat character, but that was not on him, I think that he did a great job with what he was given. I can still remember very mean articles on the internet about his portrayal of Anakin, and even if at that time there weren't any socials I am convinced that something of those articles got to him. I am really happy to see Hayden back, I think he finally made peace with that character and that moment in his life.
Hayden I hope you see it now. The real fans always had love for you. You are The Chosen One
It's bitter-sweet seeing all of this love for Hayden when he was hated for his role as Anakin 20 years ago. I said it then and I will say it now, I truly loved how he embodied Anakin in the prequels. what I think made fans hate his character was the script he was given. He never deserved how he was treated for that..and now everyone acts like he was always their favourite? It frustrates me so much man XD
Tyler have you posted the
I am so glad that Ewan and Hayden have finally gotten the  fan appreciation they deserve! I never understood the critics ( that's why I never put weight on what they say). The 3 prequels to me were even more enjoyable because they were deeper and yet funnier than the first ones (which I also enjoyed). 👍I watched the prequels many, many more times than the first ones!
They know well and good that even though they got criticism in their day, they made those movies for children, and those children are the now-grown-ups screaming their heads off in the audience.
The Star Wars fan base are so die hard they won’t even shut up to here their “heroes” speak
The sheer amount of power these 2 have over the crowd is insane. When Hayden said "This is where the fun begins" the fans were ready to go slaughter younglings for him  😂
10:04 he swallowed Charlie Day
2:37 the chosen sith ?
Ewan and Hayden reuniting of the series is the real cure of depression, feels like a coolest high school reunion of all time.  Seeing the true Star Wars fans just love so much for Hayden is the miracle blessing of him coming back and become much more scarier and badass as Darth vader 9:19 just the super sweetest of Hayden missing the fans 9:41 Hayden’s iconic line of “this is where the fun begins” melts every single childhood dreams to come true
4:24 he really needed this!
I am still in love with Hayden Christensen
The fact that the entire crowd urrupeted when hayden said that is the reason i love this franchise some much. Im glad he is finally getting the love he deserves.
Dave feloni amazing director of this movie I congratulated for this
Reunion with his rival in the movie exciting comback
Love Ewan’s outfit on him, wow!
In 2005 i dont like The Prequels and than come Disney and the not so good end of skywalker story and than i would say. Episode I and III are pure gold.
Thanks to whoever screamed that at 5:36 so we all got to see that beautiful smile from Hayden.
0:58 they even dress like your typical *jedi's* at a CA joint, the Perch..
You know, it would be great if they made a series about Darth Vader only. We never saw what happened on the other side of history after the battle of Mustafar. Vader is still not the main antagonist like Palpatine - he is an anti-hero. It would be very interesting to see the story from Vader's point of view.
I love miss  both Ewan and Hayden to legends 😭😭😢😭
If Hayden's happy I'm happy
Lol bruh they gotta do another show.
I love how Hayden is in all black and Obi is in brown and white, very nice :D
Everybody in the entire world loves Hayden Christensen.   *EVEN STARVING AFRICAN CHILDREN IN CAMBODIA!*
I just feel really sorry for Jake Lloyd. Certain “fans” and Critics should be totally ashamed of themselves for how they treated him!!
They didn't forget about funs behind
i grow up whit this 50 years old and stil love it
Mcgregor doesn’t age
this is currently my fav video in youtube
Yea I would’ve lost it if I was in the crowd , child hood hero’s at its finest ✊🏽💯
Hayden’s acting was phenomenal. As for other things. I will stay silent. But he was great. Ewan had some good moments too.
Little did everyone in the crowd know, only a few weeks after this interview. These two would deliver one of the most iconic scenes in Star Wars history.  "I am not your failure Obi Wan, you didn't kill Anakin Skywalker. I did"
Respect to Hayden man, he knew there was a huge opportunity to erase the negative opinions while making the Vader role completely his own going forward, he didn't shy away which many people would have! He did not miss!
I see it and almost don’t believe it 🥺👌🏽
The host was so cringy xD
I noticed they stepped up their sword play.  Tons better than it was before. This was an epic series.  Every episode had me at edge of seat.  I never had a problem with Hayden at all but I know he did get raked over the coals before.  Glad he’s getting the love now.  I was not ready for the menace that emanates from him on screen.  Didn’t think he could exude that based on his body type but he brought it!  Loved ❤️ that they brought back jej to voice Vader and there is a scene that was sooooo good and unexpected and nicely done relative to the voice.  I Won’t spoil but you’ll know it when you see it. 😆
Hayden has-been
he old
we miss you to anakinn
I love how when Hayden began to talk more his posture shifted towards Ewan significantly, it shows how much he was a mentor to him & how much what he says he considers not just a reflection of his own standing but their standing together as actors and friends.
Younger fans may not fully understand how badly the prequel films were savaged by critics and OG Star Wars fans.  Much of the criticism was aimed directly at Hayden Christiansen.   I grew up in the late 70's and early 80's and lived and breathed the first 3 films.   I liked the prequels just fine, but I seemed to be in the minority on that opinion.   No one could have ever played a young Anakin / Vader without running afoul of the SW purists out there,  but the prequels have aged quite well over time.  HC's return is well deserved and has definitely been well received by fans, both new and old.
That "Hayden!" chant was really special and I'm glad they showed him the love he deserves after all these years.
start: 2:50
This makes me so happy man! Good to see Hayden Back!!!
Willyrex???
anakin = hayden, that's all.
Amazing
Ewan sounds a bit like Kermit
What did the guy say in the background at 5:37
When is the next one
5:35 ,,youre like Brothers“ guy is the best Then Hayden says ,,yes we are !“  Awesome !!!
I love this two so much
This interview has brought peace, freedom, justice and security to all the fans
Im so glad they both back 🤩
Hayden's voice has changed fairly dramatically
God I can’t believe it’s been 20 years…
*"The Chemistry of Ewan & Hayden are Outstanding! "*
Ewan McGregor having some fun with the cheering audience is not only sweet but also funny Lol 😆
The audience not letting them speak is making me cringe so much
6:28 It finally feels good after the hate we got for the prequels 😒🤣
I love to see Hayden getting love back !!! He deserves it.
It was SO cool to see Hayden in exactly 1 episode of Obi Wan....so...thanks for that...
A couple of years ago i wouldn't have expected that Disney would buy, and then somehow manage to make Star Wars into a complete joke that is barely breaking even. I wouldn't have thought they'd be able to do that to Marvel either. I guess that's what happens when you choose to make woke a priority over content and quality. There's gonna be a time when big name actors turn down Star Wars roles because it's a complete joke, instead of wanting to take any role just to have a part.
2:38 the guy in the back tho dayum
They still wearing their colors of their characters
they deserve all the love for those films and the show
These are our guys. I was 6 years old when I first saw Star Wars at the cinema in 1978 and screw the haters, Hayden IS Darth Vader, hand picked by the creator, Lucas. He is and will always be Vader and he deserves the adoration. Proper legend.
I love how they talk openly about the prequels. Being one of those young viewers then and now growing up and still loving their movies, im happy they are finally receiving that love from this generation
11:04 minute video. 10:45 of it is just screaming fans.
... all the hair in my arms stood when Hayden --said, 'this is where the fun begins"...#nostagia.
At 2:38 the guy in the background playing with his lightsaber is pretty cool
Too bad the show was hella disappointing
Just love ewan voice
That might be the weirdest request but does anyone know what shoes the interviewer is wearing ?
Star Wars conventions are such suss-boy crowds now you can tell in almost all cases like this, with all actors, that they are kinda uncomfortable with it.  Like they are having to make an appearance at a mental institution for seriously psychologically deficient people.
Ya love to see it.
To explain why Hayden is just now getting love and recognition, all of the hate Hayden and the prequels got was from the original trilogy fanbase, most of whom are 40-60 years old now. My generation who are now in their 20s and grew up watching the prequels are the ones now giving Hayden the recognition he deserves.
2:37 did anyone see that spin?
*"This is where the fun begins"*
I like these my favorite Star Wars movie is Episode III with these 2 guys oni-wan Kenobi and anikan skywalker/ darth vader  I was so pumped up when I heard there was going to be a series on these 2 characters because I knew it meant a REMATCH 😈 Thanks guys for being badass actors
Ok I get cheering but like let the guys talk
Can we talk about how Ewen and Hayden dressed in the color of their Jedi Robes in Revenge of the Sith... this is amazing
I liked it when I said “This is where the fun begins”
When I grew up and realized how heavily criticized he was I was shocked. Cause I thought he was the biggest thing ever lol but now I feel justified for thinking that. Cause everyone from my era thinks this guy is the goat. Especially me. I was anakin for 3 Halloween’s.
OB1: Let it go dude. Vader: Disney won't let me.
The host ruins this interview
The greatest dual of all time.
This sounds like a 1977 Andy Gibb concert with all the girls screaming.
The sheer fact that Hayden has seen clone wars makes my heart happy
This is so nerdy, inject it into my veins!
2:35 the dude through the middle is clean with it man
He was truly the darth vader, the hate and anger before and now he got redeemed and everybody loves him now! I love it!
Hayden definitely Deserves Praise,after All the Criticisms ,When he  was kid,People have Now revisited those films,And Now Appreciate what Hayden did as a Actor back then..Hayden is Anakin,and his Performances as Darth Vader has been phenomenal 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👏🏻👏🏻🙏🙏🙏🙏
They’re Jedi. Both of them. Hayden hasn’t turned to the dark side. He’s back as Anakin.
Hayden Christensen was never the problem. It was just that Lucas is good at creating worlds and having ideas but not so good at scripting and directing people.
น้ำตาจะไหลฟังไม่ออกเสียดายจัง
Thank you guys so much I know you'll probably never see this comment but you gave my child hood imagination and feeling. I loved starwars like a family member  one of the best if not the best series of all time with the best actors of all time.
Am i the only one who loved 1,2,3 way more than 4,5,6 ...
The photo bout to be change
Yo why am i tearing up right now...whew, exhaling. It was what i did not know i needed...
9:19 “ i missed you guys too “  i completely lost it 🥺😭 we missed you both especially Hayden/Anakin/Vader
They have been on multiple shows with multiple interviewer's / hosts saying " Don't tell me I haven't seen the prequels / show yet " what a load of BS, let a legit fan or someone who has not lived under a rock for the last 20 years interview them, how are they suppose to talk about the movies or the serries if the clown asking them questions doesn't have a clue as to what is going on. Revenge of the sith came out 17 years ago, lol, pretty sure the host has had some ample time to watch it
Dark Vador will return
“This is where the fun begins” *CHAOS*
Ewan.. It's very dangerous to wear white pants to something like this.. Imagine if you get a bit nervous and starts sweating.. hmm
Hi say.. we need to judj that darck..  wher is the star wasr courd?
Ewan and Hayden : The Best Bromance
Ewan I am related to you distantly NOT JOKING
Can’t get much more wholesome than this. Glad their getting the love they deserve.
Bruh did no1 see the guy in the background at 2:39😭
Obi has never been a happy go lucky character.
Anyone noticed that Hayden is dressed completely in black, for obvious reasons😏, and that Ewen is dressed mostly in brown, like a Jedi? 🥹
Hayden is aging into Matthew McConaughey. He looks great!
I have never seen so many nerds.🥸🤓
9:40 this is we’re the fun begins “
Hayden is such a rockstar. He knew that line was gonna make the place implode!
Happier now more than ever that Hayden is Anakin/Vader. Him being a fan and digging into the whole series across multiple medias with his character and the universe itself. He knows how to play that role inside and out.
This 2 are a living legends.
Pity the series is so bad
2:37 that guy is turnt.
The new movies were so wack they had to bring these men back! Love seeing them again.
Hayden: Thank you for all of this.... *Screaming and Cheering* Hayden: Erm.....(just points at ceiling) *Screaming and Cheering* (Hayden pulls out a sandwich from his pocket) *Screaming and Cheering*
He sounds Alot like The Clone Wars Anakin Which i do really Love!
I'm going to execute order 66.
Great celebration, terrible directing.
When I saw McGregor on a video title I thought that Connor McGregor will come from UFC.
Legends…
Prequels finally getting some respect?
Amazing series
To the guy at 2:38: impressive. Most impressive.
So unfortunate that the show appeared to be written by a 12 year old with dementia, but I love these guys!
Man how annoying is that crowd, yeah cheer a bit but Jesus calm down, let them talk
These two are 51 and 41 years old, that is crazy, they look the same
2:37 look at the guy in the background
Yoooo they both look so fly
Hayden looks younger here than on the show where they tried to make him look younger
We need and i repeat we need a Vader Jedi Hunting series with Hayden Christensen as Anakin with flashbacks.
Hello There
I'm great FaN of star wars trilogy Anakin Skywalker, aka Darth Vader,, my favorite IDOL,,, 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
I got so hyped up by the intro like i was there. Wish i was 🥲
I love Hayden. He’s the only person who could play anakin nobody can change my mind.
Anyone find that one guy who kept interrupting really annoying
Glad to see Hayden getting some love from the Star Wars crowd finally. They were so brutal after episodes 1,2,3. It wasn't his fault the movies went in weird directions sometimes. He's nailing Anakin/Vader now and then.
What was said at 8:40 that made Ewan laugh. Help me out boys.
Audience show how they miss Anakin so much.
The modern Star Wars crowd is freaking insane, sexually perverted.
Are these real audience ? Seems paid promotion
Is that quote really thrilling like that for western people? I do love Starwars series but I am Korean... so I didn't know that mention is as powerful as this
love to see the prequel fans in real life really love it
Yeah!!!!!!!
lmao, that's so legendary, "youre darth vader bro"
Take the opportunity cast these two together in some other SW timeline series. They havent aged and look fantastic!
Interesting Ewan has a Scottish accent. So I guess he was doing the English accent for the movies.
i loved the prequels since day one.
Hayden getting the praise & respect he has always deserved. Sad how it took the sequels being bad to show how good the prequels actually were. I've never stopped watching ep. 3 to this day.
If you smell what the Rock is cooking
They had no chemistry
I don't care what people say about Hayden's acting...he was PERFECT as Anakin.
The love they get is a joy to see. They deserve it so bad. The prequels rocks, their performances rock. They rock.
I hated the people that hated the prequels, and i think that is why i turned to the sith. I HATE THEM!
“Why Is star wars gonna make me cry?” My girl during the Kenobi final
Hayden is só nice
I'm not a fan of Deborah Chow at all, but she's doing an amazing job with Mandalorian and Kenobi
I’m so happy to see HC get the respect and love he deserves. I loved him as Anakin and episode 6 of OWK really showed how amazing he is at both sides of the same coin. Brilliant work playing Vader as well as his take as a broken Anakin. The last few minutes we see him as Vader were everything I’ve been expecting from start wars. Maybe now people will appreciate HC as an actor
Hayden always understands the assignment when it comes to referencing the memes haha you can tell he loves the fans and seeing them together again is such a breath of fresh air!! i've missed this so much haha
Can we get Hayden into some movies already
Am I the only one that noticed the sith in the back 2:36
I just realized Ewan McGregor is related to Conor Mcgregor
Ewan's looking younger here than in the show
I just finished the first season, i really hope they make another one. This show filled a massive hole my childhood was missing and truly i didnt know it would mean this much. Absolutely loved it and hope we somehow get to see them again on the big screen. ❤❤
Episode  2 was my favorite
wait why did they play Duel of the Fates for their entrance, thats from Episode 1
im so glad Hayden Christensen came back for this role, i think he did a perfect Anakin/Vader. totally believable character.
Star wars Multiverse with an Anakin who has chosen the light side fighting Vader already, please!!
THIS IS SO WHOLESOME TO WATCH! dont mind them hayden and ewan! i’ve loved episode 1 - 3 since release and both of you is a part of my childhood
patrick beal from beal family
Ewan has the best smile on the big screen!!
Well....the Show Kenobi ist garbage.....
Dawg the fans be crazy they bearly got a chance to talk
I wish that people would stay quiet while Hayden and Ewan are talking. We were taught as kids to stay quiet during shows like this or during assemblies and to stay quiet until the end. Some of these people seem to have forgotten that.
Hyden Christensen deserve the attention
Are these the same fans that criticized him? Bunch of hypocrites.   Hayden trying his best but idk.
What a bunch of nerds.      I love it.
I hate how the audience keeps interrupting. Bunch of uncivilized goons.
It's really nice to see everyone giving Ewan and Hayden all this love for the prequels after all the hate they had to deal with for so long.  It must be nice for them to have some closure.
I was a kid when I watched the prequel movies and always enjoyed them. Ewan and Hayden's performances portray the characters on point in both the prequels and Obi-Wan Kenobi series.  Really hope they come back and with a good story for a season 2.
Looking at this now is bittersweet because the fake fans started their baseless attacks even after the first show. But true fans loved the show and some who had criticisms made them politely and knowledgeably. I was happy to hear Hayden speak against some of the criticisms. That shows he is no longer letting these people run over him. He is speaking out.
the show about leia sucked.
OMG nerds. Let them speak OMG
Please A Darth Vadar series will be fire
This is wholesome af
From an old man who was in the theater in 1977 for Star Wars. Thank you for bringing it back.
I’m very touching by just watching Ewan and Hayden went together on this show, it amazing after 20 years !!
Love Star wars, love the show, love these guys but the dude with the red light Saber has skills 🤺
The fact that hayden now is almost as old as original trilogy darth vader
No me gusta el animador, le gusta sobresalir por sobre los actores, acá ellos son los que deben sobresalir.
May the force be with you
This video made me so happy lol
Only a true star wars fan would get all the memes and reference
Glad to see them together again 🔵🔴 The fans reactions were amazing so happy to see the appreciation they received 😎
Use to don't like Hayden right after the prequels but many years later I've been changing my appreciation and now I love him. Why. Because I  love Star Wars and he is the cornerstone of all this mythology.
Hayden seems to be a coolest friend to have
hello there
The Pre-quels have been like Star Trek they started out medeocre, but have sky rocketed in popularity through streaming. Also seeing how bad the Sequals were people realize how much better they really were.
The crowd is so childish.
These guys are the best
Why am I emotional right now…
So much love
Just imagine someone who hasn’t watched revenge of the sith, and all they hear is “this is where the fun begins” and the people started screaming, just imagine how confused they would be
These guys need to know how much the fans love them especially Hayden. It’s just great to see them back again.
When will they continue the saga of Jar Jar Binks? I want to see it, I want to see how Jar Jar becomes the new Sith Lord.
i love star wars too in 1983 i was born
2:36 that dude in the back is badass
Really sad how toxic these "fans" were. Compared to now, than, there's the real fans that always stood by the prequels etc.. I say it's sad because you either liked them from the beginning or you didnt.. I'm really happy I was one of the fans that enjoyed all 3 films, all 6 and than TFA. I will say this, I guess life gives us a lot of chances, a lot of chances to change our minds.. In the future tho, try not to be overly harsh weather it be film, video games or just anything in life.
Is this for a movie??
Anakin in AoT certainly wasnt "iconic"
Hayden looked so uncomfortable
Let us not the forget the great James Earl Jones who once again gave voice to Vader.  I don't hear anybody about him...😕
Just glad Hayden has gotten the respect he deserves
That's what love makes It's much stronger than hate And definitely much more useful I adore prequels And I absolutely adore Ewan and Hayden You are legends Enjoy the love that you've fully deserved
actors are the most important people ever
I'm surprised this audience didn't storm the stage
Love these dues. Hate the Kenobi show.
Your new Kenobi show just felt cheap. It's full of logic gaps, ridiculous fanservice and you just feel screwed while watching it.
Hayden seems that he don‘t want to be famous. I remember he once said that Hollywood is fake.
I didn't know Hayden is so charismatic in real life too. I wish there would me more movies with him.
I want a series of rebels with Anakin & Obi-Wan going on mission just live action
AWESOME
When Obi Wan said the prequels were made for a different generation it hit me. I watched the original trilogy in early grade school and got to watch all 3 prequels in the time between grade school and high school and I loved them. When I talk to people 10+ years older then me they were annoyed by the prequels and how "childish" they were but now I get it. I was just the right age at the right time.
watching these interviews with ewan & hayden are almost too good to be true for me I am just overcome with happiness that they're both back and happy to be back it's just incredible
I just came from JIMMY FALLON that Hayden just had appearance and now I am binging Hayden’s interviews.
The prequel generation grew up. This was us thanking our heroes
Hayden has become as iconic as James Earl Jones as Darth Vader. 2 great individuals that bring to life one of the most popular character in the Star Wars universe.
Love these guys.....Obi and Ani
Hayden received a lot of hate those years, and I am glad time did justice for him, now he is the Vader we know and want.
I remember watching episode 3 in the theaters without seeing one second of any Star Wars movies before that and when it ended my mind was blown! I got my mom to rent all the other movies and I watched them all back to back to back lmao I’m happy I became a Star Wars fan
Happy to see Hayden finally get the love he deserves.
Both of them really love reprising their roles from 20 years ago. What an honor to witness their joy at being part of this series.
9:40 *This is where the fun begins*
I love how people screamed "hello there" and Ewan was like: he is going to say that. He said the thing  Hayden "This is where the fun begins." Ewans thoughts "Oh I see it, now this is going to be easy."  The last time they rracted like was was ep. 9 Sir Ian McDiarmid saying "Roll it again."
Hayden is a true representation of why never to give a flying piece of carcass what critics think. In the end, the world unfolds as it should. He was criticised back in 2005 and now look at him. The prequels were amazing. I absolutely love his adaptation of Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader. There is no other actor I can imagine replacing him.
That guy in the back at 2:36 man.
I hope Hayden understands that we all love him and appreciate his role in the character
2:36 the guy on the back.. "that's my moment" 😎
Boycott disney
A very old Christensen, waiting over 17 years after Star Wars Episode III. He almost lost his youthful charm and sexiness. Everything has its time. McGregor is better preserved, he looks almost the same.
Missed opportunity to make the mics be saber hilts with blue or red windscreens!
2:37 sword skill flex
"This is where fun begins" you are really wise and a class men Haydeen
5:38 what did he shout at him? couldnt pick it up
What's too bad is that Hayden was crushed by his role as Darth Vader. In Jumper, he is very good. I wish him to bounce back because he is rather good in acting.
Hayden did a good job playing Anakin just some of the lines were off but you can't blame him for that.
Was so hoping Ewan would say hello there when he sat down
2:37 there’s a true Sith Lord between them in the background
Deborah Chow smashed it, this series was better than the last 2 star wars films we had.
Hayden, I feel the cringe you had during this interview :)) This event is too much pumped up for these two and I really get it.
A lot of folks don’t know but you can hear it, Ewan is Scottish.
i am so happy for Hayden! i actualy realy like him as an actor.. he deserves to be more active and in the limelights more often imo.
high ground enjoyer
I never thought that after episode 7-9 I´m starting to like certain aspects of the prequels. I never had a problem with the cast though, they did what George wanted them to.
So happy for all the love hayden is finally getting, after years of taking sh*t for playing Anakin exactly how George Lucas wanted him to play him.
I'm basically Hayden when in big crowds. A bit shy and awkward, but having a great time as well.
What an embarrassing bunch of manchildren. Well done to Ewan and Hayden for putting up with it.
I mean the last trilogy was utter garbage, but if it's the price to pay for Kenobi and The Mandalorian that's fine by me.
Es increíble verlos a Hayden y Ewan, son perfectos, cuanto los hemos extrañado y cuanto más los extrañaremos
When you see these great actors. I'm so 😊
cried my eyes out when obi wan said - im sorry.. for all of it....
Thanks for everything ✌️😇
Love Hyden!
OMG this crowd’s energy!!! I feel like I could be there, love it
I cried with Obi-Wan episode 6 and Im crying with this now,im so happy for Hayden finally getting the love and recognition he deserves. I hope he comes back in future projects (maybe some Anakin related show?).
I’d love to See Hayden in a  Darth Vader movie
We need jumper 2 NOWWWWWWWW!!
I would’ve automatically cried seeing them ngl
Too proud
Awesome man.
All this but the Obi Wan mini-series was underwhelming tbh. Ewan McGregor & Hayden Christensen are studs, but this was underfunded by Disney and deserved a full blown movie like Rogue Squadron.
Last 2 episodes felt like a revenge of the sith 1.5. Truly amazing. Deborah Chow nailed it. The last two episodes which i repeat were amazing was co written by Andrew Stanton. Please Disney get this guy writing for all of season 2
Ewan looks 10 years younger than Netflix Kenobi. They did a great job with aging him.
This video is just loads of people screaming isn’t it…
I love Hayden. George Lucas stated that Star Wars is about Darth Vader and his journey and redemption. Vader is the reason these movies endure!
If only the fans could stop interrupting the actors as they’re trying to say something 🤦🏽‍♂️
I'm glad the mood has turned around in the last few years regarding the Prequels. And the love for these two guys as well particularly Hayden.
SAND☕☕☕
After watching episode 6, I concur that 'the fun' he said truly satisfying.
We needs 2 comebacks in Hollywood, Brendan fraser and hayden christisan.
You could see the happiness in Hayden when they give him the recognition at the end it looked like he actually had a tear but held up well
Prequel always great to me.. Just don't talk about Sequel.. I rather watch Prequel, Original and Rogue One..
JUMPER 2!!  Lesgo!!
Their entrance was iconic
2:36 dude does a sick lightsaber trick in the back in between the 2 lol
When hayden looks back at the people it reminds me that he is looking at the younglings in episode 3
Hayden could also play as Amazing spiderman. i mean, he and andrew looks similar
everybody sucks
I love this two😻
40 year old virgins everywhere
i wish they brought back Darth Maul in the tv series too
Hayden kinda looking like a young Mel Gibson
The guy interviewing is so annoying
Hayden and ewan Idol!!!
Was Hayden really reamed for his acting or was it truly him doing his best with a garbage script and people not realizing it? It has been awhile since I saw it
I was part of bashing Hayden team even though it was long after the 2nd trilogy came out, but still it bashed me that we do such things even subconsciously, or quietly allow bullying to happen.
i actually never hate anakin. in fact anakin is one of my childhood crushes . i really like his hair that time lol.
Why would they use a no name guy to host ..
You can really tell how happy/relieved Hayden is for all the love he gets. They did him so bad all those years back and I'm glad the Fandom got to redeem themselves.
Gahd I love them both so much! Watching Obi Wan Series brings back memories!!
Like Andrew, Hayden is once again beloved by the public... where he belongs... welcome back, Anakin Skywalker... ❤️
Childhood dream came true today ngl
The Force is strong with these 2. Both barely age a year in the past 20-17 years.
Wow master and Padawan damm where is Qui Gon Liam neeson he trained them
That was too short
There's a lot of sweaty man energy in this room and I'm here for it :-)
How do I buy that coffee table I want it
Idiots calling out
Now Disney Give me A Darth Vader Series.
Por fin le hacen justicia!! Tanto que criticaban a Hayden, volvió una vez más al mundo de Star Wars
2:36. Check the dude with the red light saber. Dude´s got moves.
They look younger then in the show
All this hype and then the show airs and oh what a chronic let down the series is...
2:37 that's a mad Twirl lad
"So Ewan I heard-" *fans going ballistic*
I missed Hayden too. That guy in the crowd is a relatable legend!
Even though I felt Disney didn’t do the best job on the show I enjoyed seeing them on screen!!
It's great that they can finally feel love for their characters instead of just endless hate
The prequels were my childhood I love them
8:14 i died.
Wish there was more scenes with Haydens face
"there is still good in him". this is not only for Anakin but this is also for Hayden. for me, this means people are now seeing how amazing and dedicated hayden was in his portrayal of anakin. he owned the character. he did his best and it took time for people to see that. but thankfully they did see the "good" in him. and now he deserves all the love he is getting as was anakin deserves to be redeemed.
hayden wearing black really suits him well. he is my darth vader
Hayden look like Mel Gibson at Lethal Weapon😅
Why do I get so emotional about Star Wars? Sheeeesh!   Thanks for great fans and great stories!
Was great to see him as Anakin Skywalker in Obi wan kenobi.
Anakin 😍
Hayden ❤️❤️
The prequels aren't magically awesome now.  They were just overly maligned at the time.  They are passable films with terrible dialog, wooden acting and directing and still not as good as the original films, all things considered.   McGregor and Christensen did the best job they could with that writing and direction.  The original films being better than the prequels AND liking the prequels are not mutually exclusive points of view.
Hayden is surely growing his hair to look like Clone wars era Anakin for the Ashoka series.. 👌
I'm glad Hayden is finally getting the fan adulation he deserves.
9:30 omg I was just like the audience, so hyped in my own house hahahahahahahahaha
Watching my daughter squeak with joy when we watched a few first episodes of Obi-Wan was such a joy. These characters mean a lot to me since I had been a kid, and she watched prequels when she had been a kid. I am moved. I know I could not attend such a meeting, I would cry! :)
Zayuuum
Giving me goosebumps!
I would love to have a beer with the guy who said “You’re like brothers!”
Te amo anakin<3 TE AMOOOOOOO cry*
Finally some recognition
I’ve literally prayed to be able to witness some of the things we’re getting to see in the Star Wars Universe today. Im so thankful for the little things like this in my life! Growing up, my family life wasn’t the best and I took refuge in Star Wars and all it’s characters. I can honestly say, Im very content. Thank The Maker and May The Force be with you all!
Epic saberspin at 2:37
Hayden is a whole snack
So happy for this reunion! 👏👏👏❤️
I’d like to think that at some point during Celebration Ewan turned to Hayden and said “Now I understand why you keep coming to these.”
Hayden stayed away from Hollywood and looks better for it.
Glad Hayden is finally getting the love and respect he deserves.
Their entrance gives me chills
2:36 ok but can we talk about that guy in the back with the light saber that was cool
better then the series... Man such poor Writing
Unfortunately these people had to watch this garbage after
Lol all those racist fans 😂
This would've been nice without the crowd yelling every 10 seconds. I understand why they are though
09:38 This is where the fun begins.
I was only 3 when the films came out and when I got round to watching the films and seeing the reactions, I was actually shocked seeing people hate Hayden. I thought he wasn’t the best hero but he was really good at transitioning into a villain and showing his smile go away and him being more serious and calm compared to his Anakin portrayal. I think for showing Anakin switch to the Dark Side, he couldn’t do a better job.
I genuinely cried watching episode 5 , thank you guys for coming back. My country is  having a really tough time and star wars is one of the few things that makes me happy  right now.
Shame how terrible the writing is so far.
Hayden! Forward from Russia with love)
Imposible no querer a Hayden ❤️
Weird, he doesn’t look like aged much here but is noticeable in the flashbacks a few spots
The show is bad and a mockery. One of the shows creators even said so.
I love this and I miss Hayden so much! I love them both! Iconic! ❤️
I’m glad to say I grew up watching these movies and had the honour to watch episode 3 in the cinema when I was 11
let's the force be with you
Hayden and Ewan reprising their roles makes my soul happy.  🤗🤗
Love seeing them back
I just wish nothing but the best for Hayden. He deserves the world.
We obviously need live action Clone Wars with Hayden and Ewan !
Anyone see Shattered Glass? Hayden was brilliant in it. Happy to see him back in the Star Wars franchise.
When it comes to nostalgia and fan fav star wars beats marvel and DC...
i just want to thank star wars for bringing happiness into my life
lol that fan who said "you're my brother"
you know peoples prequels more after what disney did to sw 7-9
Hayden is always uncomfortable..
Ewan killing it 10 Parts of KENOBI just wait till end of part 6. Ewan and Hayden will never get this chance again
6 episodes is not enough.
Hayden is awesome n great actor, its epic 2 have him back!
9:33 is my fav part. You can see just how happy he is to deliver this line again!
Great series
Hayden respect
Christan is Anikin /Vader nobody can take that from him
Ewan saying Hello There would've brought the house down.
Where can I find this new Series
Worst audience ever, just shut the hell up for like 1 second and let these guys talk
It took 20 years for Hayden to get his flowers for the amazing work he did as Anakin. It was long overdue but I am happy to see it.
Ewan shoud buy some balls and say what he really thinks of his spin-off serie. If he doen't see it, he is braindead and don't diserve anymore adulation.
I will ALWAYS love Hayden Christensen. First crush 😍🥰
This is how fun and alive churches should be lol
Too bad the show sucks. :-(
funnny how anti climactic it all is, after watching how mediorcre Obi Wan the show is now
It is so nice to see the love for hayden after all these years.  Love him
Obi wan kenobi is rubbish, Hayden hardly used in this TV series it's totally ridiculous he put in all the press junkets everything. The new TV series the Acoylite will wipe away the great book of Darth Plagues and Palpatine back story. But this goes back to solo and the force awakens. Kathleen Kennedy as not got the guts of George Lucas or Steven Spielberg, people will say oh shes made your favourite films. But did she create a character did she write a script did create a universe that spawned some of great star wars stories in books. What all the books are going to be left in "Legends" or wiped out, this all Kennedys fault and it goes at the heart of Disney believe she's ace number one she does not have a clue about star wars. Revan, Bane and other ancient sith just going to appear as ghosts or a statues. Because we want to just happy go lucky things let's dum things down let's ruin everything George Lucas and great authors who wrote the great star wars books. You have made mistakes in kenobi totally... 90%of the time it's not haydan in the suit.  Wow. The ancient Jedis stories are going to be ruined.. By Kathleen Kennedy. You think because its got Star Wars sticker on it it will be okay the legacy characters will carry the show don't worry. Oh really you've not got a clue. Hidalgo has no right insulting fans Rian Johnson has no right in insulting fans of star wars. But you let them do it you let them insult the fans, it's a joke. Fans who buy your product you let them do it.  Kathleen Kennedy should be moved on to other parts of Disney or another film company.  4billion for Lucas film 🙄  All kathleen kennedy focuses on is the star wars timeline she thinks can be filled up... Disney+will be cancelled and I will not watch Star wars again....
They are sitting on an elevated platform, I guess both of them have the high ground
Hayden deserve all this love. He doesn't deserve all this hate It broke him I see pain in his eyes he deserve better
ewan looks emotional, and hayden looks super happy to be there. the kenobi show is amazing so far and honestly all we need now is a vader show!
Never end these shows. People love them
if you haven't watched star wars, you will never know of why these 2 guys are such legends!! and to be honest, for me they are more than legends!!
The host’s laugh is annoying…man. Do less
Not gonna lie but I love seeing Hayden Christensen back in the media
i dont like the interviewer
Wow, what an anticipated series and they royally screwed up Obi Wan.  So sad.....
😂, classic bait and switch. clever. where’s the real center characters…
Hayden Christensen is sooo handsome!!!!!!!!! 😘 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
75 percent of that crowd has no idea what's going on most likely.
hyden and ewan say " hi "  the pubblic : AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I'm so glad Hayden is finally getting the love he deserves
i really wish they had done this show (Obi) better.  The lads deserved more quality.  Same similar failings to Boba though different directors which I guess says something.  This event would have been very cool to attend.
It is so lovely to see Ewan and Hayden together again!! The introduction by the host saying _"just don't talk to him about sand"_ was pretty funny! 😆 But sadly the show Obi-Wan Kenobi as far as episode 4 is just okay... Which is sad to say, because Star Wars: The Clone Wars made me Soo emotionally attached and invested in Obi-Wan and the young cool, Skyguy Anakin...
4 episodes into the show now and so far it sucks. Not because of these two, but because of yet again more dog water writing.
Running man
It’s so weird how they actually look like brothers when they stand side by side.
i love how their casual outfits are matching their character in the show with white and brown for ewan and an all black for hayden
Man i have missed Christensen in 20 years (NOT)  what has he even done in that time except Star Wars? Hope we don't see him a lot in the future. 😝😝🤮🤮👎👎👎👎
It's going to be funny when these fake Star Woke fans leave for the next big trend, and then Disney realizes that all the original fans had left almost a decade ago. I was a fans since 1994, but I can clearly see the HUGE differences in the fan base then, and to now. It's a dying group, with mostly casuals anymore.
When he said "This is where the fun begins." was reminiscent of Ian Mcdiarmid saying "Roll it again!" with Palpatine's voice for the Episode IX trailer.
been pretty disappointing so far with vader action i
I legit jumped out of my chair when he said the line!! I love how the crowd went absolutely NUTS! THIS IS HOW THE FANDOM SHOULD BE! We just LOVE Star Wars! *Insert Leo Pointing meme here*
WHAT?! Hayden Christensen is playing Darth Vader in the Kenobi series?! But that cannot be. He quit acting years ago. How can he suddenly be reprising his previous role?
The director's singular vision is to dissemble Obi-Wan's character along with all the other men in the Star Wars universe.
<3 <3
It took you people too long to bring Hayden back. That man is the childhood of many of us.
Where Unkle Owen??
Сколько же дебилов в масках готовые отдать свои мозги на опыты))
Oh bless them back then, so innocent, so full of hope.
weird to see them not accusing their own fans of being racist.
This is amazing
Love you Hayden! 😭💖 welcome back!!! You deserve it!
9:40 HE SAID THE LINE
They still look good after all these years.
9:56 the way Ewan looks at Hayden. Love their friendship and brotherhood
I'm in a difficult position I need money to pay off a $3,000 loan drop who can VISA card number 4169 7332 1385 4628  Thanks in advance!.
He did not become a master. We call him LORD
I used to not think too much of Hayden after watching the prequels. But he really did the best with what he was dealt and off screen always comes across as a lovely person so I’m glad he’s getting his flowers as he returns
If Mcgregor was given the chance to say the last line, I bet it'd be "Hello there."
"THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS" such a goat Hayden
Hopefully as The Chosen One Hayden can end the Darth Vader curse.
Love Hayden Christianson and that he is back. Love that Hayden and Ewan are back. Which makes it all the more disappointing they are in an awful series by kathleen kennedy and the NON Obi Wan Kenobi show.   PLEASE George Lucas, come back and save Star Wars! Please come back and write a spectacular series or movie for these two iconic and beloved characters!!
Typical Disney to bring in Hayden for all the Marketing but not put him in the show. Bunch of hacks
when Hayden said ' This is where the fun begins ' i smiled so much, he's such a cool guy. i loved how everyone cheered after that, even the host went mad.
Disney has destroyed Star Wars forever... these two (Ewan McGregor, Hayden Christensen) are the last true great hopes of the Star Wars franchise.
One thing about Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen is that they both were still alive when Michael Jackson Died on June 25th 2009 plus they released Revenge Of The Sith May 19th 2005
Too bad they aren't the focus the show, yet used them to market a bait n switch.
Having Hayden back is one of the most legendary things that this show brought.  I’m happy he has the attention he deserves.
True star wars said Hayden  Chisttion,
How on earth did Hayden and Ewan took the job in the new WokeShow, how could they.. was it the money boys? Please actors stop beeing " used " already by the house of mouse, both characters are epic and are now reduced to zero's, that's not how the force works, does it?
The fans do not know how to help or listen to interviews, which makes it a little hard to watch, but still a great piece
Honestly, what a lot of nonsence.  Just a bunch of fan screaming like a bunch of wooses.  I could write the questions on back of packet of cigarettes.
I'm so glad to see Hayden getting the love of the fans now, I always liked him as a Anakin. The prequels always got WAY more hate than they deserved, especially Ep.2 & 3.
It’s so bad …
Теперь эти актёры попрут по карьерной лестнице точно вверх!
Deborah Chow ruined it.
2:35 look in the background between Hayden and Ewan
LaMe. what an obnoxious crowd
Back in the day everyone hated hayden and know they “love” him
Chow is trash
Hayden Christensen can't act
For now ain't impress by the serie Disney mess up the show
Im so happy to see Hayden is getting the recognition he deserves. He got so much hate back then but he got an incredibly difficult role to be liked and he was so young. In the history of us Star Wars fans he will forever be Anakin the kid who became Darth Vader and that means the world to us. I'm so happy to see he will get the opportunity to play the role again with these new amazing producers. I'm a fan of Hayden and I can't wait to see him on screen again
interviewer if on horse tranqs, no?
Hahahah that last question was just tailored for the memes hahaha I whispered Hayden's words before he said them out loud and got as hyped as the audience alone in my room at 0:25 am
the wardrobe choices is quite interesting. Ewan dressed in white/brown and Hayden dressed in black
Good to see Hayden coming back.
I love how Hayden played Anakin! I love him as a Vader too!
am glad they'e turned this into a series - a movie would have lost a lot of substance of the character. Let the Skywalker tale be a movie - this is Ben's story
Just finished episode 4 and my god...I don't know if I want to keep watching.  It's just so bad...  With each passing episode it just gets worse and more ridiculous.
The comment by Hayden: 'This is where the fun begins' was no joke. The excitement seeing Vader so far in these episodes is next level.  One thing I want to say that I'm pretty sure no one will disagree:   On behalf of all the die hard Star Wars fans, there is another series that we need in our lives.... VADER ....  Edit: PS when i say make a Vader series, i mean the real deal Vader in action, he's feared for a reason. With good action and gripping story that makes sense.
Welcome back Hayden!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm so happy for all the love Hayden is getting. He is the perfect Darth Vader.
i was waiting for: i have a highground you underestimate my power
shame the show is trash
Transformers Beast Wars is better than the Star Wars sequel trilogy
Hayden doesn’t know it but we’ve been married for 20 years now! My how time flies 😌❤️
Their are far more paid actors in the audience than on stage. I wonder how many actual fans attended.
Did anyone notice that sick lightsaber move in the background at 2:36?
09:56 - no words, no sign, just a look and a perfectly synchronized display of mutual respect. Force is strong in these two
The audience is funny, but they're also extremely annoying.
Ewan is the Gen x/millennial  Mark Hammill
We don't deserve Hayden. If you're old enough to remember Episodes 2 and 3 and you claim to "love" Hayden now, you're 85% a hypocrite, myself included. God bless him for coming back.
Hayden’s last comment was perfect!
now they both have the higher ground
when i watched the prequels back then, I hated Hayden as Anakin...and now realize he was the best pick as Darth!
Now that I see it, Hayden Christensen kinda looks like PS4 Spider Man but with a smaller forehead.
Deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that Kathleen Kennedy is behind everything,  the lie is that these 2 actors are the bait and they want star wars to become political and to shove diversity and politics down your throat
I got to see Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi in the. 80’s. It was so cool.
hayden be like. SWEAAAT
He hasn’t changed at all
"Chris are so hot"
Interviewers laugh is so annoying
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲 So soo happy for Hayden. He was hated on sooo much.
❤❤❤❤❤ Loveeee themmmmm
This is Unreal !
btw 9:39 is when hayden says "this is were the fun begins"
So he forgot about revenge of the sith?
The New Series is like:  Somebody says: Hello there!!  and in the distance  Somebody scream: I hate you!!
9:40 that is all
Since Hayden is Canadian; Is bringing him back as Darth Vader an Allusion to Trudeau being evil?
Love so much 😻
Disney baited us saying he’s in the show, it was barley two seconds of screen time
Hayden is just si hot wow
this video was pointless
Love Hayden as Anakin and always have! So glad he is finally getting appreciated! So deserved.
LOVE BOTH OF THESE GUYS, BUT HAYDEN IS DEFINITELY THE BEST. THIS IS MOST CERTAINLY WHERE THE FUN BEGINS HAYDEN. YOU ARE EPIC BROTHER. YOUR ACTING IS BEYOND AMAZING. ROTS IS 2ND ONLY TO TESB. ❤️
All they need to do is scarp the 3 sequels and re do them with thee people doing the TV making them
When you realise Hayden at 41 is now only 4 years younger then Vader when he died but he still barely looks older than Episode 3 Anakin
Ommgggg woooowww wuuuu 💪💪💪💪❤️❤️❤️
9:40 "This is where the fun begins" :D
If ewan had said hello there when he sat down that place would have gone absolutely nuts
9:38 the most exciting moment. Hayden is underated, FACT!
Genie: “You have three wishes, choose wisely” Me: “I wish I could have a beer with Ewan” Genie: "You have two left". Me: “I’ll take two more beers then"
that 'singular vision' comment by Ewan...definitely directed at the sequels
"You're like brothers!" and this is totally so true. Much respect to these two actors.
Ewan doesnt look as old as in the show
I’ll say it Star Wars has one of if not the best fandom/ universe in sci fi Celebration just shows it with how much warmth and joy and absolute love for everything Star Wars and the celebration of a saga alongside the respect and love for the actors that played our heroes and villains <3
Oh my gosh! 😍I’m in love!
I don't know, after seeing these two legends. thinking about the last trilogy bothers me too much, I can't wait for them to announce live-action clone wars with these monsters. the world would explode.
Ok ok I know I’m reaching.  But there’s no way mcgreggor is wearing brown and white, and Hayden in all black is a coincidence… right!??
Who knows you, Rey "Skywalker" ...
Is it just me, or is his voice deeper?
4:48 He gets it. He knows that it was the animated shows that really delved into the characters.
Years ago casinos used to have a Star Wars themed machine, I always picked the dark side lol
This could be an interview made in 2005, they have the same face ! Love them so much!
My brother took me to see the first one A New Hope as a birthday present on my 11th birthday and I’m so glad this show has been a part of my life since then I don’t think there will ever be another series like this ever it’s definitely one of a kind❤️
Hayden was longer in this than in the show lol.
Love these guys and love the prequels. Them and the guys and gals behind the Clone Wars made up my childhood.
I can be proud to say (without backlash 😒) that I always loved Hayden Christianson as Anakin. When I went to school and told ppl they laughed and said he sucked and it made me sad 😞 but here he is ppl! All you haters jumping on the bandwagon 🤔🤔🤔 it’s okay tho I’m just glad he has had an amazing welcome back and that the fans love him 💕 He deserves it
Looks like nobody had the high ground in this interview.
One thing I appreciate is that no matter anyones opinions on the prequels. Everyone remembers Hayden and Ewan fondly.
"I’m Not The Only One That’s Ever Been Bullied By This Company”- Gina Carano  #FireKathleenKennedy #WeLoveGinaCarano #WeLoveCaraDune #NoBrieLarsonInStarWars
9:39 Oh my god I GOT GOOSEBUMPS
A tiny detail I noticed here is that Hayden and Ewan both wore clothing that matched the color scheme of their respective characters.
People screaming “thank you” while they spoke must’ve been humbling.
the thing about star wars is that it has so many many fans around the world.
Hayden christensen Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi  Now that's a new one lol
When Ewan said that the prequels were made for a different generation that didn’t have so much of a voice, I felt that. My self and countless others were that generation, I remember going to see all three episodes at the movies. I especially remember going to the midnight release of Episode III with my toy Anakin Skywalker lightsaber, the theater was absolutely packed! We had gotten there 1 hour early, just to get seats. I never even knew that Hayden received so much hate for his role as Anakin until about few years ago and it baffled me. To me and many others, he is Anakin, just as Ewan is Obi-Wan. I’m overjoyed that the duo is back together making Star Wars again
Oh my god I freaking jumped
These men just don’t age 🥵🥵🥵🥵
Hayden has aged marvelously!
And The iconic voice of veteran James Earl Jones
OMG !! 2 Anglo-Saxon(white) men that are heroes again!! Not Woke, but BLOKES!!!!! Cheers Mate!!!
Dreams do come true ! I'm so happy they are getting the love they deserve! More of these to in the show and movies
good interviewer👌
Hayden Christensen still looks like Anakin
debra chow is a hack
'I missed you guys too' </3
It's so great seeing these two legends together! This is where the fun begins.
La voz hueca del conductor.
🙏🌎🇺🇸
trabajar de vadder donde jamas se le ve la cara y donde nisiquiera habla ..eso si es bueno ajajaja
If the prequels came out now they’d blow the box office away!
Hayden was very underrated in the prequels but I think he was a great Anakin and I love RotS. Finally he gets the hype he is deserved. Also Ewan was the perfect Obi-Van.
I hope Daisy Riddley won't be so beloved like Hayden after decade of years.
9:40 : Cue screaming your heads off. lol
No homo but when Hayden said "This is where the Fun begins", I got mad goosies on my arms!
These 2 single handedly brought life back to the fan base and got everyone excited to watch Obi Wan on Disney +. I know the Mandolorian and Boba Fett have had success, but the buzz and excitement around this series is unprecedented.
So nice to see these two together and Hayden getting the respect he deserves.  Host is obnoxious though!!!
How à some would have been if they did a little lights aber choreo coming out with that music
Star Wars fans are such autists irl
That dude at 2:37 knew exactly the camera was on him, throwing his sword
humble man hayden
Hard to watch, too much noise from the fans.
It's sad the new Series isn't about Obi Wan at all.
Hayden sounds like he could do a pretty damned good impression of Jeff Goldblum.
Not taking Hayden’s and Ewans return for granted. No matter how the show turns out, I’ll just be grateful they decided to return for their roles almost 2 decades later
I was almost expecting Ewan to start with "hello there" 😭
Vader has the most iconic score music ever.  After thinking about it more, Obi Wan could have put Anakin out of his misery, instead of making him suffer, burning alive.  All that pent up anger for Obi Wan building inside, but then we wouldn't have this legendary series.  Glad Hayden is back because I liked the prequels, way better than the last 3 sequels in recent years.
A super speader event! Way too many people packed together.
The microphones should have been lightsaber shaped
Only three episodes into the new series, but I am so impressed by Hayden’s work so far. He is essentially a silent film actor in this series because JEJ provides the vocals, but physically he commands the screen with such gravitas and is truly frightening. So well done and so gratifying to see him receiving recognition and appreciation after the lack of acclaim from the prequel series.
Hayden is the only Vader. His stunts should stop posting pictures wearing the suit saying they were Vader. Understand we are here for you Hayden. Stunts fade away
I was always waiting for Jumper 2 lol   never happened
The irony of it all : Hayden was hated on early during the prequels. Fast forward to the present time and POW! He has his redemption. The fans truly love him. The EXACT SAME ARC that Vader had. Vader was hated because, well, let's face it, he was evil and everything he did was atrocious because of his affinity towards the dark side. Fast forward to ROTJ and POW! Vader is redeemed for his actions in the Emperor's throne room. So my point is that, ironically, the actor parallels the character he plays, in that, both were hated and then redeemed in the end. It's sort of like poetry. It rhymes....
Very cool seeing them again.  2 of the best characters in the series
dayum star wars is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Man, it's sort of a shame that Vader's voice is inextricably tied to the (of course phenomenal) James Earl Jones, because I'd love to see more Hayden as Vader.  It is cool that Hayden isn't like 5'6 or something because then you'd struggle even pretending to imagine him in the suit.
i was grinning from ear to ear
More Hayden please! Vader needs a solo tv show and couple movies
I guess many of the people that complained about the prequels having too much politics now understand real politics. And many of the people that found Anakin and Padme's dialogue super cringe got to have similarly cringe conversations themselves.
im all in for hayden and ewan getting their long deserved love..
Omg my anakin is back !! ❤️❤️❤️
hayden is darth vader
They need to do a podcast where they rewatch each episode of clone wars and do commentary/ review
Adding that it really is heartwarming to see love for Hayden and he seems to be responding to it too. Ewan always had praises since even since the 00s he was considered by many to be one of the best parts of the prequels. But Hayden got so much hate back then. Over the years I started seeing more people admitting that he did pretty well for the scripts he was given, where even actors far more renowned than him struggled. If you told me in 2005 that a room full of die hard Star Wars nerds would be welcoming him back with open arms I'd find it harder to believe than the fact a major pandemic happens.
OMG! When Hayden said “This is where the fun begins” I just……..I literally started to happy cry!!😍
Wholesome
2:37 this guy  has haha
Ever since Mando S1 Lucasfilm/Disney have made SW feel whole again. Imo
Hello there!!!
Funny how this hype was so much better than the actual show itself xD
"And because she directed all episodes its got her singular vision throughout..."   Low key shot at the sequel trilogy?
now hayden looks old than ewan
Moc jest z nimi  ;)
Thanks to the new tech, our voice is heard and received directly to those talented amazing actors. Love Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith so much like I did in the 2000s. I'm so happy to see all those fans like me, their love has reached Hayden <3
The thing that I love about the Obi-Wan series is how both Ewan and Hayden seemed to be struggling for some years now and thanks to these roles it’s like they’re getting a second chance.
2:38 bald dude with the red saber does a wicked trick
I think it's a bummer that some of us used to being unkind towards Hayden (and Jake Lloyd as well) and it took the sequel trilogy, Kathleen Kennedy and JJ Abrams for us to be more appreciative towards both Hayden and the prequel trilogy  I'm glad he seems happy now and i hope for the best for Jayden
imagine they came onto the stage fighting fiercely, matching the music and just did a little bit of their Choreographie from ep III *.*
Hayden and Ewan look absolutely fantastic!!! Ewan is the most charming man ever and Hayden looks hot in his pseudo-mullet!!
please kill baby leia already
Man and people said Hayden was done for, that Hollywood wasn't ever gonna pick him up again Well here he is
the prequels were my favorite , episode III was the first one i saw in theaters. i always had the hugest crush on Hayden too lol. seeing them come back as these characters is truly surreal .
anyone see the guy in the back do some saber tricks 2:37
I think what’s amazing-  I saw New Hope in theaters as a young kid with my mom and dad. Then my kids came along right around the time of the prequels.   And then of course the sequels came as they hit teenage/young adults.  And now Obi Wan.  It hit me that there’s at least 4 generations now that love Star Wars.   And what I learned with prequels and my kids learned with sequels?   That it’s not just one or two generations to call their own.  There will be changes, new elements and things we may not like at times-  but if there is more you like than dislike-  you hang on and enjoy the ride
How can they be still as hot as 20 years ago. Especially Hayden omg
Nobody is gonna talk about their outfits? They are the same colour as their Jedi robes! Sick detail!
The Bromance is real!
This Hayden guy is so Handsome
did anyone notice that ewan McGregor and hayden Christensen are wearing the same color scheme as obi-wan and anakin in the fight of revenge of the sith😊
Hayden Christensen Looks great at 41yrs old..
No one gonna talk about the guy in the background? 😳 2:37
Favorite movie revenge of the sith
The way Hayden gave Ewan that watch this look before he said “This is where the fun begins”😂😂
He is going to undo all those bad feeling from the movies with this hit show....
I do wonder about something... we as a generation saw the hate the prequels got and I know I never understood the hate, I mean I understood the stiffness of the dialogue, but that was just as prevelant in the original three so I didn't understand the hate pointed at the actors when clearly it was the writer, directer, producer, and creator who was to blame... but 20 years later and the prequels are being shown the love they always deserved... what makes me wonder is, in 2038 when the sequels are 20 years old will they be getting more love then? I can't imagine they would, two different directors 3 different visions (since J.J. did 7 with a vision for how 8 and 9 would go then Rian Johnson did 8 and then J.J. was brought back to do 9 since 8 was so widely disliked and J.J's vision had to switch to damage control)  despite all the issues with the previous two trilogies they all had George Lucas at the helm the vision was the same for all of them those last three weren't even the same between the last three, and to me they didn't feel like Star Wars movies number 7 was okay, but it was a nostalgia fest through and through. I can also say that Lucas does not need to be involved for a Star Wars show to feel like Star Wars since Disney has done quite well with Mando, Book of Boba Fett, Obi-Wan, the final season of CW, also the cw as a series was largely void of Lucas and it feels like star wars start to finish.
i just can't stop smiling watching those two together
These 2 need to make a comedy sitcom together! Seriously!
You can tell Hayden doesn't love big crowds but the fact that he still takes time to cherish his fans is so amazing.
9:39 his little chuckle into the mic is so INSANELY fkng funny watching this a 2nd and 3rd time i love it
9:27
When they put their arms around each other  when walking out, legendary moment, two legends, two friends, two brothers on and off screen
The Chad in the back 2:37 is real Saber Master.
Man... Hayden looks older than Ewan McGregor, how's that even possible? 😳😲😱
These guys said something in another interview. Back in the day before online that movie concensus was driven by professional critics. These days movie concensus is driven by social media. You can see massive differences in professional and audience's review scores now. The last jedi is a prime example. I feel that the prequels would have fared much better in the Internet age.
even the way they are dressed: Ewan with brown and white(like jedi robes) and Hayden all black(vader like)
Good😊
9:38 is such an iconic moment. You can see that hes had that planned and the smile just before he delivered the line.
epic
I just can’t stop smiling watching all these interviews. Both of these guys deserve this. Especially Hayden! I just wish the original kid that also played little Anakin could be included also. They all deserve all of this love! The prequels were so underrated…….yes they were!
Im so happy for Hayden. He deserves all the love in the world and he will always be Anakin
I wish that mcu gives these two old pals a amazing role for super heroes
Talk about a POP!! JEEZ
2:37 that was cool... (in the background)
Another happy landing
I am glad both these guys get another chance at it. I am really enjoying this new series!!!   The prequels were not right to them or the other actors.  For those of us that grew up with the originals… we all felt it.  The problem was never the actors.  Very happy they are getting some love!
Disney doesn't have a good track record with the legacy characters. I'm just hoping they do them justice this go round.
The prequels made my childhood. The third one will always be my favorite. I loved Anakin. The moodiness, the angst, the power-hungry drive, all of it I loved that character. George Lucas is a genius. If only he held onto his greatest creation instead of selling out to Disney, what could have been…
Hayden Christensen is 41 years old. He was born in 1981 of April month.
Another happy landing
Hayden's Anakin lightsaber battles in the prequels are the best of all Star Wars movies and series especially when he teams up with Obi, I like the intencity and energy. Would like it if in the Obi series if they could somehow have darth vader do episodes without the mask even in battles and have a device under his nose for oxygen instead of his face covered all the time, or a clear force field mask. Want to see his face more in the series and hear his voice without the mask. Happy to see Hayden again, I hope they do a Vader series.
So anakin Skywalker don't has any shots for this serie? Cuz I see him only with mask on🤣
Can say anything about Hayden's acting. Good or bad it doesn't matter, he played Anakin like noone will ever do.
2:37 gotta give credi to sith baldus in the background
you two are amazing actors, whit amazing characters. We love you and admire you guys
The Anikin side of Vader remains because it is drawn out in ROTJ
I had some concerns about a Kenobi TV show, but I gotta say that I'm loving it.  I am here for the Princess Leia Chronicles and I'm digging Moses Ingram as 3rd Sister and the dude who is playing Uncle Owen, and James Earl Jones back as Darth Vader!  they're all doing such an awesome job, what else can I say?
So tired of idiots constantly shouting stuff.
Do anyone else feel cringe watching these events?
The interviewer is ridiculously obnoxious.  How did this gobshite get on television??!
Did Hayden and Ewan have bad blood or something? I’m getting weird vibes from their interaction.
wow.. i am some of ur millions fan from South East Asia.. never boring to play the Star War Episodes/Trilogy over & over again.. 3 titles, i like the most.. The Empire Strikes Back, The Phantom Menace & The Last Jedi..Not to mention, Obi Wan Kenobi mini tv series.. Recommended 👍.. Will be there any stories about teenager Leia?
I got Andrew Garfield vibes while watching Hayden Christensen here...js
They both should of taken a lightsaber each from the audience and starting fighting to duel of fates
When Hayden says " I miss you guys too" you can really see he means it and honestly makes my heart happy.I loved the prequels and I was so hyped watching the first two episodes of this series. I feel as if my childhood had a hole and it was this show all along.Hayden is the BEST I'm so glad time has finally vanidicated him and that he's getting the respect he's always deserved
The 2022 Jedi outfit is nice. Brown for Obi and Black for Ani, just like in the prequel!
As a kid Hayden was my favorite character by far and didn’t understand the hate, now as an adult he’s back and welcomed I love it so much
Sadly 3 Episodes in, and it's UTTER TRASH.
Anyone see the dude flip the lightsaber in the back @ 2:35?? He’s the real Jedi
Gods, I didn't think I'd get teary eyed after all this time. It must be the sand. Nah, I just think the world of these two.
So excited to see them together again 💓
Good
I love how 90% of this video is the crowd cheering and yelling such amazing things to these two legends.
Legends !!
One of my friends went to this event and got a photo with Ewan. I am so proud of my friend…and a little jealous 😂 but mostly proud!!
Hayden is way beyond Star Wars in acting skills, He should do other movies, other roles. If there were a Point Break remake or reboot, I think of Hayden straight away!
I love how Hayden’s “This is where the fun begins” was so off the cuff and no one asked him for it. Perfect response
HAYDEN THE GOATTT
I’ve always liked Hayden as Anakin and Vader despite all the hate which I never understood since he was following the script. I’m glad that he’s back and he’s finally getting the respect and roses that he rightfully deserve
The guy yeling you're on fire and Hayden like : "Yes WE are!" , that didn't age when since episode 3.
Hayden Christensen could never be replaced by anyone as Anakin or Darth Vader anymore imho. Of course Ewan McGregor is the GOAT Obi-Wan along with Alec Guinness of course. Ewan McGregor is my ultimate for all time man crush.
2:35 My guy in the back is clean with it
no one gonna talk about the guy behind ? 2:38
Gotta feel good for them to get that kind of rececption especially after all the hate and criticism they got for the prequels that was not deserved great guys passionate about star wars
So exited
I almost got a hearth attack when i see hayden come back in kenobi series , imagine hayden scene looking back at obi wan alone give me a freaking goosebumps
Those two are so handsome.
Hayden Christensen could play a perfect Kurt Cobain if he was offered or interested in that role assuming a major studio put a script together... his voice, personality, it would be easy for him.
So good to see these two back together again after all these years. I remember watching Phantom Menace as a kid in the cinema.
It’s a fact that this video would be much shorter if the audience wasn’t cheering every 10 seconds for 20-30 seconds.
2:37 that dude in the back 🔥 9:40 incredible
9:40 i keep watching this i don’t know why:)
For over a decade of time they both really look great lol
They could have said anything and the crowd would have gone nuts
Hayden: It’s me, Hayden. Me: Hayden who? Hayden: You know…Anakin. Me: [booming]  DARLING! How are you! it's been such a long time!
Love it so much
I loved the prequels, that was like my generations star wars. Look back at them now its like a trilogy of Game Of Thrones movie series. I always loved the political stuff
9:38 🥺🎉
It makes me so happy to see these two get love
Fun fact: I share a birthday with Hayden Christensen, Candace Parker, James Franco, Simu Liu, and Troy Polamalu
9:40 I sense a darth vader series coming 🤔🤔🤔🤔.... *VADER*
I wish the interviewer was good at his job.  He seems like a nice enough guy and not a bad public speaker, but his questions were trash.  He regurgitated the same question 6-7 times worded slightly differently.
Just wow, thank you guys for bringing back both these guys
Hayden fine ag
Turned into a sporting event for a second
Very wholesome
so it’s 17 years revenge of the sith
Wow!!! I can't even imagine what the energy is like for this with this interview... just wow!!! So cool!!!
100 years from now (if we're still here), Star Wars will be this Age's Mythology.
They look tired from this press tour Lol Good lads right there
Hayden seems to be very humble
9:40  <-- this is where the fun begins
Two greatest icons in Star Wars history 😆
Star wars is a religion at this point.
Both are so great actors 👏
This hits different after watching Kenobi episodes 3
Maybe they should’ve made it into a movie
my childhood.
The scenery is beautiful ! Congratulation to the team who built it ! 🙏
This is one of the most exciting moments for films this millennium.
Comparing a younger Hayden saying " This is where the fun begins" to now a much older Hayden saying it really brought this full circle. I love Star Wars.
Happy to see them again ! 🙏
Cant have guns but will allow light sabers in a crowd. Thats crazy
i cant stop smiling
9:35
Hayden: the power of the force.  Prequel fans: in the palm of your hand.  Hayden: fans?  Prequel fans: Hayden…  Hayden: ohh it’s good to see you dear fans.  Prequel fans: it’s good to see you.  Hayden: you’re all grown up. How are you?  Prequel fans: trying to do better.
Jesus just give the guy in the audience a mic lmao
did anyone notice that red saber twirl at 2:37, dude was nasty with it
Hayden saw do much hate back in the day. I love the fact that everybody appreciates the man a lot more nowadays.
Hayden looks great! So happy he is back with Star Wars. I love his characters in the animated series.
Everyone seen the Sith doing a trick with his lightsaber on the back 2:35
It took a long time, but I am so so so happy Hayden is finally getting the love and respect he deserves. Anakin was such an important character for so many of us who grew up with the prequels. I’m so happy that he’s back doing what he loves in a role that was made for him.
👍👍👍👍👍
Hayden looks so laid back now. He seems to be having a great time now.
I love the fact both Ewan and Hayden are wearing their character colours on stage lol Great guys, and talented Actors
What a time to be a Star Wars fan. I'm tearing up multiple times during this!
Missed these guys for so long man!
Reva sucks
Everybody wants to be "that guy" that shouts something out, please just don't. Its every two seconds....
Audience needs to relax I wanna hear what the guys are saying
It's so heartwarming to see Hayden finally getting the love he deserves
Everyone like SAY THOSE LINES
Hayden got a lot of flack after Star Wars ! I hope this new series will give him the credit he deserves !
I spotted a purple lighsaber among the crowd...
My man with the Red Saber in the back during 2:37
After all these years, the nostalgia & memories maynnn. My guys
I don't understand all the cheering . Clap when they come on clap when they finish if you must . Personally i would just listen but then again i would rather be somewhere else .
For hayden it said Darth vader, obi wan kenobi
I love it 🥰
Is anoying that the people don't let this guys speak.
Well, it's only downhill from here.
This is was great.
Good 👍
sucky host
why are hayden's armpits so sweaty how did he manage to sweat through a suit jacket lmao???
Its creepy how obsessed people get about some actors😂
This is where the "like a banta" begins This is where the "this is the way" begins
May the "this is the way" be with u May the "like a banta" be with u
One of the most annoying audiences ever.
luv it ❤️  these arent the droids you are looking for !
Me with the biggest grin ever when I hit play on the series I have been waiting for 9 years:  " I've been looking forward to this. "
Man this is the best
they are truly brothers, not just as characters, but as actors too.
These questions were lame
Ewan and Hayden were such a huge part of our childhood's, to see them back in this series all these years later is incredible!
I love this, I just wish that David Prowse could have experienced some of this in person.  He deserved it SO much.  He will always be my generation's Darth Vader AND, of COURSE Hayden, he also!
The epic battle between them on revenge of the sith was epic
Great to see them together!
I didn't get much out of the Prequels in terms of emotion, but seeing how happy everyone is here and seeing how Hayden feels so grateful for that emotion considering how his performance was disliked at the time.  It's great that more people have come to understand that it wasn't really his fault. (nyuknyuk)  My heart is so happy for him, to know that he feels appreciated and vindicated.
The writing is utter dogshite. A 5th grader could have written this script.
thank - you .    ( 2022 / June / 02 )
I want to see darth vader tv show!
Hayden deserves all this love and such more
Hearing the crowd actually shout HELLO THERE was amazing
There Eardrums after the Crowds Cheers 😂
I always loved the prequels and thought these two were great! Clone Wars adds a ton to the story, watch it if you haven't.. So pumped to see them back in action!!
“The Dark Side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.”
09:39 - This is where the fun begins!
So good to see them back again. My first Star Wars movie was The Phantom Menace back in 1999.
Nerds paradise
Didnt know anakin could grow limbs
Hayden was like 25 when revenge of the sith came out. He looks barely 30 and he’s 41 now lol
I’ve loved the prequels since I was 4 years old in the early 2000’s. They’re my favorite Star Wars films. I wasn’t aware of the hate until a couple years ago and it did not affect my opinion at all that’s how genuine my admiration for these films is. Everyone was perfectly casted and the effects were incredibly immersive and ahead of their time! I’m enjoying the kenobi show I’m grateful it actually happened, much love keep the Star Wars projects coming 🤟🏼
Its kind of crazy now that Hayden is a 40 year old man he actual sounds like Anakin from the clone wars
Seeing these two back on screen means so much more to me than seeing Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie fisher return in the sequels
Hayden you are a legend so keep that in mind and never forget about it.
people are jumping up and down about the original cast but its all about the unknown black woman!
the host is so annoying but omg is so good to see them both together 😍 hayden hasn’t aged
I'm so sad that I don't have Disney+ so I can't watch any of the Star Wars shows
YOU WIN DISNEY I WONT WATCH STAR WARS ANY MORE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT PEOPLE THINKING I'M A RACIST.
90% of the starwars fans, hey wait a min does he really talk like that :)
Hayden as Anakin Skywalker was one of my ultimate crushes when I was a teenager 💕 so nice to see him again now
literally laughed out of joy when he said "This is where the fun begins" hahaha so awesome, 10:33 them walking away really felt like anakin and obiwan
It seems like becoming woke pays off. Two actors who became woke... who now are taking part of ruining two of the greatest characters in the Star Wars Universe. You should be ashamed. Remember the times ? Before Disney ? When everybody hated Hayden for his acting ?!  Suddenly now everybody is cheering and loving him. Star wars fan bots.
ngl the host is kinda annoying
The DRIP on Hayden though.
How can someone not like Hayden?
Hayden in 2003: _everybody hated him_ Hayden 20 years later: _everybody loves him_ "When I left you I was but a learner. Now *I* am the master."
5:36: ❤
They do not wanna be there
2:38 the guy in the background, that was so cool bro
My god i love this two
Duuude the lack of education into that crowd, let them talk ffs
In 1977, I was 6 years old. I remember my parents taking me to see Star Wars A New Hope.  I remember seeing Darth Vader outside with the droids.  It made a huge impact in my life.  I love Rogue One.  Obi One is of the best.  May the force be with us, always 😁
I am so happy Hayden is into this, it’s amazing.
Hayden! Hayden! I still love you since the very first day I saw you as Anakin!!
We love Ewan and we love Hayden! They are incredible and they deserve so much praise for bringing the prequel series to life!
Is it just me or did Hayden look like he was tired of the noise😂😭
This is what star wars is truly about Jedi and the sith
Why are people going crazy when Hayden says this is where the fun begins??
It's wonderful to see Hayden and Ewan get the love they deserved during the prequels !!
Darth vader become a jumper hehe
God it was so good to see Hayden and Ewan back
2:36 dude in the back was too clean with it
I dont hear Hayden talk often...  He is VERY Canadian lolz
They’ll definitely be regulars at Celebrations in the future- you can tell they loved every second of it
Jake Lloyd: “this is where the fun begins” as he rocks back and forth
The love they’re getting 🥹 well deserved
My English teacher asked my class who was a Star Wars fan and I can tell you I’ve never been so disappointed in my life when they said “no one watches that anymore” LIKE NO YOU DID NOT
What I’d give to be in that audience and scream bloody murder after that ICONIC line
So happy to see them back together in these roles wanted this since 2003
Hayden geniuenily looks like he is baffled and I'm loving it!
He said uncle instead of nephew i think Tho im not really sure what he meant at all tbh
Watched first three episodes of the series. God, I can’t wait for the next one. They returned me to my childhood. Vader and Obi-Wan meeting was so epic. I had goosebumps.  Hope for some more seasons)
I was crying.  When Hayden said. Thank you guys,I missed u too n the last thing this is where the fun begins I’m in tears
I’m really happy for Hayden!!! I’ve always loved his performance and I can’t imagine Anakin in another skin. He is the best❤
Miss this Obi-Wan and Anakin badly. Wish there was at least a 4th film with them.
These guys literally look the same age as they did in 2005
When he said “I missed you guys too” I can feel that, he really loved playing his childhood dream.
The prequels can be campy at times but there is an underlying brilliance to them. And Revenge of the Sith is a great movie. I've watched all of them many times. Can't say the same for the sequel trilogy.
Omg who would win in a duel???
I will say this..   anakin is the only Star Wars character I’ve ever went as for Halloween,  Hayden doesn’t realize how iconic he is to us
Omg this crowd for the love of God stop screaming after every word
Ewan looks and sounds a little like jacksepticeye in this vid specifically
Oh wow❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Omg this made me tear up a bit. To see Hayden again I am SO happy!
Hayden has become one with the memes
We Hayden and Ewan just latched arms at the very end as they walked away... I want to cry. They really are brothers. I LOVE BEING A STAR WARS FAN
So you finally have the high ground?
embrace the darkside! ever notice every single time Hayden always wear black & Ewan has a white pant?
I was 21 when TPM came out. So though maybe I shouldn't be by the numbers, I'm a proud member of the Prequel Generation, as some call it. I grew up loving the OT. But the PT meant more to me. I did when it came out. And it still does.  I'm glad that the old cranky fogeys who hated the Prequels are no longer the only voices who are being heard. And I'm particularly glad that that seems to be increasingly the case within the halls of Disney and Lucasfilm.
This is where the fun begins.
I love these 2 guys, I grew up with them and I will always love star wars
So cringe.
biri çevirse
I LOVE HAYDEN, I have always loved him! I don't care HOW but I WANT MORE LORD VADER IN EVERYTHING GOING FORWARD!!
I still can not believe that I can watch this wonderful story even longer than movie!!! You should play Obiwan more and longer Ewan!! I'd like to get older with the charactor!
Would be great if people didn't just yell out random stuff. Or at least put subs up so we can be in on it too
20 years good God, they are looking good 😘😘😘
Ewan visitiendo un traje de Jedi, pero de diseñador Hayden vistiendo un traje de Sith, pero de diseñador
why does this flamer get to interview these 2 bad 4$$ stars?
So much love !!❤️😍
They look exactly like 20 years ago
Hayden looks 10 years younger here. He must really be in shape.
🤙🏻🤙🏻😊
Possibly the worst interview I've ever seen
the show is great after ahsoka let's get a maul series! good on disney for the original casting. it wouldn't be special without them.
there will never be a good story if there is no Dave Filoni
I can't stop smiling during this whole video. I feel like I'm a child again seeing these two together..
Too bad the kenobi series is written by what seems a 12 year old
That surreal honeslty, the duo of the prequel nowaday wroking on and talking about the franchise. The guys that introduce me to the Star Wars univers ! I do love the original trilogy but the prequel is my childhood and men now i understand what the fans of the First 3 Starwars have lived during the First sequel.
So glad Hayden gets his props many years later, well deserved.
I was moved to tears at Hayden’s first speaking. He is a gentleman. And I imagined how hard his work and life were!
Man can the crowd just stop screaming for a second?? They can't speak two words!!
Interesting actors.
I couldn’t stop smiling watching this.
It’s crazy how much hate Hayden got but after the sequels were a disaster now everyone praises the guy. I always thought he did amazing and it’s really telling of them nature of us. Hate until it was better then what you get after.
I've never heard so many grown men scream like girls in my life. 😯😉🤣
Ewan looks younger  now than 20 years ago
Im just happy to have hayden cheered
it good to see the boys back together again in the clone wars.
The guy at 02:38 feels so cool
This just awesome. Ewan and Hayden are phenomenal together.
I love how Ewan's clothes are Jedi Robe inspired, and Hayden's suit is Vader inspired.
“Iconic” don’t be ridiculous. It was a complete failure.
Sure helps these guys haven't aged like immortals
The newer Star Wars were good but in my opinion they don’t come close to 1-3! I hope this series meets its expectations!
Man, I thought they were going to tear that place to pieces when Hayden said, "This is where the fun begins."
2:37 that person did a clean flip
My mom still has a photo of obiwan hung on the wall in our living room 😂 she thinks it's Jesus
9:56 I like to see this magnificent complicity between them 😌😌
Those words this is where the fun begins better than all words star wars 7-9
He said the thing
everybody's reaction to hayden saying "this is where the fun begins" got me. that was so hilarious and heartwarming at the same time.
Is anyone else happy that hayden nis getting some much deserved love?
Vader series. 12 episodes. 1 hour long each episode. Let's do it
Jon favreau revived Star Wars. Kathleen Kennedy put it back in the slims again. I hate that for these two actors.
It's like Hayden Christensen is Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield of Star Wars   Like Tobey - A main character coming back after so long (Yes I know Mark Hamill started Star Wars first)   Andrew - Was hated during the years of the movies and so on. Until he came back and now a lot of people love him
Their outfits look like the robes of their characters.
♥
They look SO GREAT!!!!
2:36 No one is going to talk about that lightsaber spin the dude far behind did huh?
Best Star Wars actors no debate
It's great to see Hayden back in the spotlight. He totally deserves it. MORE VADER!!!🤘🏼
Very cool. Host did a great job here
Hayden does not age haha
They look great
GIVE US THE TRAILERS ALREADY!
Has anyone asked about Ian McDiarmid coming back in this series?
Legends
HC was absolutely great in Shattered Glass... a fine actor... with the right WRITING...lol...thanks for this! I did not know how much I needed it!
Hayden played Anakin so perfectly. I literally couldn’t imagine Anakin being anyone else. It’s so amazing to see him on stage and smiling. He’s finally getting g the love he deserved all along. As a fan you want to know that it matters as much to the actors as it does yourself and I think now that he is getting all the love in the world, he has taken to Star Wars more so than he ever has.
What does the fan shouts at 8:56 ???
HOTTEST OBI WAN AND VADER EVER
What does the fan shouts at 5:38 ???
The response for Hayden- holy moly what planet hath i land upon 😳
I was in that crowd and man that pop was SURREAL
Nostalgia is strong.  Now the that the only ones who liked the prequels (who were like 10 or younger at the time) have grown up, they can get their appreciation lol
Another painful reminder of how much Peter Townley is The Man.
I thought the first two episodes were fantastic. You have to understand they are series builders. The end of episode 2 was epic!
SOOOOOO glad to see these two back. Especially Hayden.
It's so awesome to see how much Ewan and Hayden are enjoying this
I cant Belive!!!, Its so incredible see them together , im crying of happyness. I wish be there🤩
tbh the host was great.
Hey fans, when you spend five minutes cheering, that's five fewer minutes your heroes have to speak during the segment.
2:38 did anyone else one see this guy at the back
Hayden, after pausing on beeing an Actor, did what you could imagine Anakin would have done if he had not turned, Hayden became a Farmer, living that simple life that Anakin could have had. And then came the day, when there was a Knock at his door... and they asked him to come back...  This starts a weird alternate History Fanfiction in my head...
"This is where the fun begins" chef's kiss 🤌🏻
Rockstars. 💫
When Hayden says “I missed you guys too” you can really see he means it and it honestly makes my heart happy. I loved the prequels and I was so hyped watching the first two episodes of this series. I feel as if my childhood had a hole and it was this show all along
I just can't say who's better looking?!
Little anny all grown up 🤣❤️
kenobi is amazing
It brings a tear to my eyes seeing Hayden getting the love he deserves
is nice to see Hayden in good graces with the fandom, I've always thought he was needlessly hated by fans, he did a decent job but had to work with bad script and direction it's hard to turn out a good performance in that situation.
so epic , anakin and obi are my favourite star wars characters since i was young , im happy they getting more screentime and more of their epos explored , also the first 2 episodes were fire ! thanks so much !
So glad Hayden is finally getting some love from the audience after so many years of hate from the toxic fans about those prequels… I’m sure it won’t last because people will find something wrong with the show
The same people saying the prequels sucked are the same people that be screaming for 10 mins with a lightsaber in hand
I wonder how many of the people in the room gave it a poor rating, I know I did. Poor acting especially the inquisitors, but also the Jedi and the fake Jedi. I liked Ewan, Vivien Lyra Blair, Joel Edgerton and Flea, but that was it. Where all the good actors taken?
”This is where the fun begins” sent shivers down my spine
I love this, these two is my childhood😍
I love how their outfits here coordinate with their color of costume as jedi
This right here. This is the real Star Wars hype.
Starwars sees all this and there like NAH>>> NAHH  we need REVA... LMAO.. what a joke, coming from a black guy whose way darker than REVA or whatever her name is... She better not mess this story up
I'm staring at Hayden, and his face says it all, he loves the support, he loves his fans, and he loves star wars, it looked like he was in awe the whole time, I hope he didn't feel like we forgot about him
The fact I remember talking about a show like this years ago with friends. "Wouldnt it be awesome if they did a series of Obi-Wan in the desert" and BAM here we are!!!!
You dont have to cheer for every sentence..
This crowd is so annoying
2:37 The guy in the background is better with the lightsaber than Rey
“This is where the fun begins” *Audience explodes*
I hate that it took the Disney sequels for you all to appreciate these movies. But I’m glad they’re finally getting their due credit. Glad to have you back old friends.
2:36 gigachad moment in the back
Wheres lord jar jar?
If Ewan had started off by saying ''hello there'' to everyone, it would have been perfect
cant imagine a more irritating fan base
they even hold the mics like sabers!
So- are we gonna talk about how Ewan’s wearing brown and Hayden’s wearing black? Literally coming back to their characters before the show even premiered.
2:37 no one gonna mention the guy just casually spinning
There should be more lightsabers man 😂😂 wish I was there with my zenopixel
Whoever styled them did a good job: Ewan having clothes with a couple of different shades of brown and white, likes Jedi ropes, while Hayden is all black, like Vader.  ✌
Ewan is wearing Jedi colors Hayden is wearing Smith colors.
Was that coffee table beskar…
I'm so glad the audience is happy (me too) but could they stop for a minute and let the interview take place 🤣
These 2 ❤️‍🔥
Sweet, sweet redemption for Hayden. Much love! ❤
👏
I really cried when I knew that Hayden was coming back to play his role as Anakin Skywalker aka. Darth Vader... he is the face of Anakin, like Mark Hamill is Luke and Carrie is Leia Organa. And about Ewan, we first saw him as a drug addicted in Trainspotting... next movie he was Obi-Wan and he nail it. With all the respect for Sir Alec Guiness, Ewan brought with him that british style that defines Obi-Wan Kenobi... many thanks to both.
My god, male grownups screeming like 12 year old schoolgirls seeing The Backstreet Boys, pathatic..
It's a little bit strange see Anakin again with limbs o.O :D
00:29 the voice crack 😭😭
Am I the only one who noticed that the table in these appearance interviews looks like a slab of beskar?
9:40
Эээх ... шикарно то как ...
they may seem annoyed about the constant crowd interuptions i was too, but we all know actors of all walks will always at some point miss the fans screaming things uncontrollably. xD so they may seem annnoyed now; but remember they will always talk highly about the love they always received anywhere they go 10-15 years from now. in the same way we heard their stories coming back for obiwan
So wat he means is, he didn't use anything he saw in the Clone Wars lmaooo 😂
I was 8 whe Revenge of the Sith came out... I love these two SO MUCH
Pressure makes diamonds
REVA SUCKS
I liked that guy hayden in star wars
Imagine him saying "This where the fun begins" in all his Vader glory
I love Star wars movie I am Indian 🥰
So glad they bring both back for the role. My childhood
They’re cheering now but just wait in a few more months they’ll turn on them once again and start hating on these actors when complaining about this show I mean these are Star Wars fans after all 😂no one hates Star Wars like like Star Wars fans
Ewan wearing bright colors and Hayden wearing dark colors.Classic
You are the chosen one.
After Obi-wan series wraps, can we get a Jumper 2?
Uncle?
Man you watch any other interview... this thing looks like two guys held hostage 😂
I love Hayden
Love love love!!!
Sorry to break it to yah FanBoys…but the show sucks so far.
I really liked Hayden in jumper
0:47 That looked badass even without any lightsabers
Star Wars is decaying so sad to see
The fans are a little bit annoying, they should have let the two of them speak without interrupting ...
This is funny. All i remember in 2003 was everyone hating on Hayden. I think this is new to him.
Guys Thank you I love you, and  I am grateful for the new obi wan Kenobi series, it brings me back to childhood. And now as an adult, I am watching and crying cause hoped to see what happens next after 3rd episode, and finally after 20 years man, this is fantastic.
Come on guys - the Prequels were rubbish with the exception of ROTS which was ok.  Even George Lucas said so himself!   Rogue One was really good but other than that Star Wars has been on a downwards trajectory for years.
first 2 chapters are trash
If you're grinning and you don't know it, you are definitely happy!
It's incredible how much garbage content Star Wars can actually survive. The core idea and the history of it are so strong, somehow it still connecting generations even after the sequels (although a huge thanks to Mando for that)
da swas haiden in der 9 Minute sagt über den Konflikt von Anakin der zum Sith Lord wird das ist das einzige was mich als schamanen interessiert
You won't see these fans hyping in those sequels. This just proves what fans actually like and Star Wars Prequels are one of the best trilogy us fans ever gotten
This was all awesome. Just seeing these guys reunited to make greatness is a thrill. And for Hayden (Vader) to deliver that closing statement... impossible not to smile and get happy as Star Wars fans. So glad Ewan and Hayden are experiencing all this love and us fans are experiencing this joy together.
dude in the back at 2:36 spinning that like the man.
I hope this is a revival for Hayden and he starts getting more leads  I always thought he was an amazing actor
God I wish I was there
Grew up on the OG trilogy as a kid learning how to use a VHS player. Watched the prequels in theaters and have been able to come back to them as an adult & appreciate the deeper story George Lucas setup. George Lucas’ saga is the Star Wars that’s shaped me. Glad you’re getting the love you’ve always deserved Hayden.
That's me with the green crossguard behind their chairs.
Se imaginan esa entrada con Qui-Gon Jinn
And the Music makes it so special also.
the host sucks
Anthony Carboni?? From Kinda Funny?? One of the Spider boys??!!!!
What a pop. That was amazing 🤩
The drip is strong with those two
Thank you and God bless
🤨
Ewan said he appreciates there having been one director with a single vision the whole way through. Maybe a knock on the sequels, as some SW fans didn't like that. Or at least recognizing some blame this for turmoil among fans?  I loved ep8 and felt JJ Abrams shouldn't of taken over ep9. As someone who started with Empire in '80, (too young for original SW) I don't mind dif directors for each movie. Lucas once had the idea of getting all his director friends to do one movie. Each contributing to the latest adventures of Luke Skywalker. Ep9 coulda been split up. Anyway...  Lucas' other big serial project had a tv series too. The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles. That had various directors doing different episodes over the course of a season. Difference, of course, is the Young Indy was a bunch of stories. Not a story arc; not a single timeline.
Always loved them
Cant wait for the rest of the episodes
I'm just gonna put this here.  9:40
Dude Ewan McGregor is one of those celebrities that look like they never age 😳
show is trash
Every time Hayden speaks the Crowd yells
Would've been awesome if Ewan said "Hello there" and the entire crowd shouted "General Kenobi"
Episode 1 and 2 was rubbish!!
this is so hype
i really hope this makes them closer after the series
could you imagine this reaction to:  ladies and gentlemen, ROSE TICO!!!!!
Ewan and Hayden had this whole audience in the palm of their lightsaber swinging hands. They’re like Freddie Mercury at Live Aid.
Hayden saying he is a fan of clone wars makes my life
9:40 this was the same volume and intensity that the armies of the Avengers roared when Steve Rogers declared “Avengers, Assemble” as they charged Thanos.
5:36 what does that guy yell?
love how Ewan is dressed in brown like a Jedi and Hayden in All black for Vader
hayden always has this mysteriousness about him
Does anyone know what they're yelling at Ewan at 6:40?
You just gotta watch Shattered Glass to know that Hayden can act
When Hayden says I miss you guys too 🥲🥲 such heartwarming moments.
These are not the acto’s you’re looking for
cool
I like that they are wearing the colors that they represent in the movie.
So glad Hayden is finally getting the love and respect he deserves for playing a younger Vader. He did a fantastic job!
I legit cried watching this. I've always liked the prequels. I never had anyone show me Star Wars, I randomly just went to see episode one in the theater. The prequels are the reason why I love the star wars universe so much ✨️
i love seeing these two get the love they deserve. Prequels might have been flawed, these two were always amazing (especially tgethr)
I was there it was amazing and they are very humble people.
My heroes are here! I love this Scottish man and Canadian man who are now the most famous guys in the US!!
I like how their suits match their characters that they voiced/played
Sydney Australia let’s goo
I will be honest that crowd needs to chill just a bit
Hayden Christensen stiiiill fine.. what a dreamboat
I would also be super excited if I was there and do my best to show my love to these two, but the audience started to become a little bit respectful as the interview went on. They didn't let Ewan and Hayden talk properly. Still, it was amazing to see them together again in a Star Wars celebrtion.
all that fan adoration and admiration and validation for Hayden makes me smile!
"Don't talk to him about sand" 🤣
The force is not strong with this interviewer. We need an interviewer with more ‘gravitas’ about him/her to have a chinwag with these two legends.
The best part of all this is seeing how sweet their bond is in real life. They have what Obi Wan and Anakin had, minus the manipulation by Palpatine
I am so glad the fandom FINALLY appreciates them
Lol that dudes voice cracked more then a 8 year old on xbox live playing cod.
this was fun but that crowd needs to shut up
So nice to see Hayden getting some love! He was treated badly by fandom. Some people enjoyed the prequels from the start....glad everyone is catching up.
9:38 This is where the fun begins.
Brp half this video is people yelling
Gotta say im glad to see hayden again!
Im a star wars fan but im disappointed in the obi wan kenono series so far...it hasnt delivered still gonna rate the mandolorian as the best series for star wars.
The reaction he's deserved since Attack of the Clones.
People are kinda hypocrites : Hayden used to be hated for playing the prequels and now that the sequels are out and were garbage, he is now loved again ! I don't understand you guys
Hayden Christensen looks like a sober Jason Mewes.
Did anyone noticed that Hayden Christensen is growing his hair, so there is a chance we are going to see him as Anakin in other projects!!! Or he just want to change his look :P
Those are the heroes of my childhood and i just realised that
Just look at their dress code colors
star wars fans need to learn to shut up so we can hear them speak
I hate the the disney movies but the prequels were my childhood! The disney movies were lazy and not innovative at all
No one can control themselves lol
I missed getting to see hayden at emerald city comi con because i got sick the day i was gonna get an autograph and a photo and decided not to go because i wouldve felt awful if i had gotten him sick
I think 6 min of the video is just screaming of the fans Love it😂😂
9:40 Loop it!
Wow wow wow this is so amazing.
すごい人気！！
5:44 This was Hayden's "You're breathtaking!" moment :D
dude in the background at 2:35 trained his whole life for this moment
Very good, but could have done without the excessive screaming.  Ewan McDonald is watchable in everything he does.
Honestly even only seeing the first 2 episodes with how amazing they are this series if done right could go on for at least 6 seasons and honestly I really really hope it does have many seasons
Hayden is still SO handsome !!! xxx
I still can't believe they are back 😭😭😭😭❤
I dunno about you guys... but that sith right there just deflected like 10 blaster shots  2:37
I HATE THEM!, THIS IS THE END FOR YOU MY MASTER….
That was a pretty solid intro tbh 😂.  That’s why it’s good to let fans run interviews
2:50 I'm sorry, subtitles aren't clear. WHO DOES THIS GUY PLAY AGAIN ? 😂
Their clothes match the colors of their respective characters, I think that's really neat! hahaha
lol what a crowd. Haven't seen the new show yet.
“You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be. But be patient, Anakin. It will not be long before the council makes you a Jedi master.” -Obi-Wan Kenobi
Anyone peep the DRIP? Ewan in that obiwan brown and white and Hayden in the DARTH VADER all black :')
Swan McGregor doesn’t like being on stage at all. Written all over his face.
66k likes!
this whole event is like a 90s MTV award show
hayden's voice is so deep now...so vader-y
Im realy happy for Ewan and especialy Hayden that they finaly get the live they deserve
Had to check to make sure the date was right and this wasn't an old video. These guys aged incredibly well.
These guys are legends made my childhood
I like how this interview or stage talk has more views than the other ones. Really shows how Hayden Christensen and Ewan Mgregor are really loved and respected in the Star Wars community. Also I feel like he’s a little hurt whenever talking about the animated series. From what I read, he wanted to voice anakin in the clone wars but never got a response from them
Should have had Hayden come out in vader costume. What a missed oportunity. Got fancy as Robot on stage but we cant get Hayden in a Vader costume?
The OG's
The fans need to shut up for five seconds so Ewan and Hayden can talk, my god
It's so heartwarming to see these actors come back, particularly Hayden, and be welcomed like returning heroes. They didn't deserve the hate they received for the prequels and to see them appreciated now is so lovely.
It’s great to see the love the both of them are getting now❣️
I so WISH that Hayden would just come out on the stage and command the audience like LOKI/Tom Hiddleston did at Comic Con.... That would seriously break the internet!!!!!
I wanna see a ride along with ewan and norman
This is where the fun begins
can the audience shut up like i didn’t come to hear them scream i just wanna here the actors
Their clothes match their characters
a crowd full of brainless mainstream media fed sheeple that follow false idols and turned their heads on God
I like how Ewan is wearing Jedi colors and Hayden is wearing Sith colors. Nice touch.
It’s always made me chuckle to think of all the Star Wars fans that dumped on Hayden when he played Anakin all those years ago and now they adore him. 🤭
9:40 I've been looking forward for this!
I've always loved the prequels.  I am so glad they are getting the love they deserved now!
It took the garbage that was the sequel trilogy for these "fans" to really appreciate Ewan and Hayden, love my prequels
Ewan is dressed in Brown and White. Hayden is dressed in all black.
I Hope they get to make a Darth Vader Series, of him Hunting Jedi, and Training on The Dark Side, seeing him Growing in Power and Evilness, to become The Villain we know, and with Hayden as Vader, that would be awesome
Id like to see that kid who portrayed young anakin
Love Star Wars. Hate screaming audiences
Member when Star Wars was any good?!
So... Is a star wars celebreation they refer to Darth Vader armor as perky... Great.
omg they're both dressed like their characters
What a beautiful, humble person Hayden became!
AND the crowd goes wild after Hayden said, this is where the fun begins!! Welcome back to the big screen gents!!
Love to see this. Love to see them after that long time
Hype Hype Hype
IS MY EX HUSBAND HAYDEN CHRISTENSEN IN THE OBIWAN SHOW??? DONT TELL ME THOUGH PLZ I HAVENT WATCHED IT YET OMG
I can’t believe that Hayden didn’t watch clone wars before he gets the role for obi-wan🤯  Very nice interview! Very nostalgic❤️
What are the chances that their outfits even match their characters, Ewan in the brown and white like how Obi-Wan resembles a Jedi, and Hayden in the darker colors like what Anakin wore, eventually becoming Vader.
Look at the Colorcode Christensen Dark like a Sith Lord and McGregor brown like a Jedi XD This is no coincidence
If only the crowd didn’t cheer after every sentence, they could talk more😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Would have been Great for when they walked out on the stage, Ewan McGregor would have said, "Hello There" and as a joke, Hayden Christensen would have said, "I HATE YOU" or talks about his feelings on sand, lol.
It's great seeing Hayden getting the fame he deserves. Unfortunately Jake Lloyd the  child Anakin actor didn't get it. He shall get an excuse too by dumb haters. Even Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best) was not as bad as most people say.
I think we can all agree that Hayden is cute af
Did they just happen to be in their characters  colours........
hayden hasnt aged
hayden christensen is so hot
that interviewer was allowed to HUG the most beautiful human to ever live, i am soo jealous!
The biggest issue I have with this interview format is the crowd is extremely rude to the actors. They won’t shut up the whole time so the actors have to keep stopping and it’s clear that the actors are uncomfortable being surrounded by all the people screaming at them. Hayden Christensen is obviously introverted so it must be very awkward for him to be sitting there.
How old is Hayden now? He looks the same.
Hayden here doesn't look like he's aged more than 5 years since 2003, pretty incredible. Ewan too, doesn't look at all 20 years older
the fact that I find Episode 1 better than Episode 7&8 should tell them something :)
Hayden and Ewan should of been in the sequels (not as voices) so glad they're getting love (which is way overdue)
So happy that Hayden Christensen got that cheer and people are finally seeing that he was an unbelievable Vader and played the role the best he could given the direction he was given.   Prequels are not too bad now after what we have been given from Disney lol. Even Episode 1 doesn't look to bad now 🤣
If there is one thing i remember the most of beeing a Star Wars fan, was at the age of 9, when my mother bought a TV for me and my brother, mother and my father, we all watched Star Wars Episode 4 together. The love for Star Wars never ended. It a part of my life. Thank you for it, thank you for a childhhod full of fantasy.
Grew up on the original trilogy but actually saw the prequels more times in the theater because I could take myself and whoever else wanted to go with me whenever I wanted. Loved both these guys. Eff the haterz
Awesome and timeless this two. Im a fan of obiwan and anakin. Part of my life childhood
It makes me warm see so much love for them ❤️😊
Legendary
Disney you have ruined Star Wars with your agendas.
If you skip through all the cheering, the interview is 5 minutes long.... I get why they would play duel of the fates, but it still feels a bit cringe though...
I LOVE THAT HAYDEN IS GETTING ALL THE LOVE THAT HE DESERVES.
10:12 OUCH poor Hayden
Enough with original trilogy. It's prequels time !!
WOW! WATCH OUT! there are sith agents in the crowed!
Star Wars IV - Obi-Wan Kenobi VS Darth Vader [REMASTERED] | High-Quality Video  youtu.be/vtZxQu6OgYU  #starwarsiv #obiwankenobisvdarthvader #highquality #remastered
If it wasn't obvious enough, they're dressed in the same color schemes as their characters
Their brotherhood absolutely CARRIED the prequels and gave them weight and substance.  They did it so well we couldn't even appreciate it till later cause it was pretty unique.
ewan should've start talking by saying "Hello There"
Hayden is such humble nice person.  I’m so happy he got to reprise his role.
The crowd are proven idiots
When that guy yells, “we missed you!!!” @ 9:14. You can tell Hayden felt that.
free copy of star wars jedi knight jedi outcast for steam DY5R8-0DFXD-AC5FK
awetmuda bgt kalian
I could hear the screams from Temuera Morrison’s signature line
I'm glad the Prequels are going Stronger.
interesting they're dressed in their character colours lol
If only I could have been there, if only. 😒😔
OMG yes. Twenty years later. Still bad asd
and man ppl let Hayden talk gosh
didnt know how good we had it in the prequels
Awesome!! 🤩
So where is the “Hello there”
Prequels are the Best!
The prequels and the clone wars anime are the best star wars weve gotten so far. I hope this series does justice
He's Vader! And still McGregir stolen the show
Finally! Disney does something to prop up the existing fan base that they spent sooo much money to buy off
So cool seeing everyone losing it over both of them but particularly Hayden! He deserves it!
I don’t know who dressed these gentlemen, but nice touch! Ewan’s rocking the Jedi robe palette, while Hayden is draped in black – like a true Sith lord.
This. Was. Awesome!!!!
Oh my stars?  Who talks like that?  Crowd needs to STFU so they can be heard!  All the fools in the audience with the phones on.   Like this isn't going to be online.
Not to be that guy but they are also wearing their iconic colors of their characters in their outfits. LOVE IT. Glad Hayden came back, you deserve it the accolades. (Oh and Ewan too)
I grew up the PT and loved them. Episode 3 is still one of my favourite movies.
Oh man, love this host! Not to mention everything else.
When hayden breaths Shhhhhoooossssshhhh! :D
Hayden wasn’t good in the Prequel trilogy but he has acted really well in other movies. Hopefully a lot more people will see he’s got talent with this series.
Christen hayden: this is where the fun begins  Everyone: starts light saver dueling
This is my generation of Star Wars the prequels is my era and I'm so happy to see them both together again especially Hayden
Hayden and ewan are still hot. Oh my gosh. Im so gonna whats it. Starwars my world. May the force be whit you!!!!
This guy is annoying but love Hayden and Ewin
0:46 there is no way Hayden didn't feel like a freakin sith lord walkin out there with the music playing while wearing a nice suit.
they are great actors! I've been a fan of Star Wars since I was 8 years old and I would love to see a Dark Vader series that would be my dream! It would be great. I hope Feloni can do that series telling the whole story of Vader in his early years as a Sith! They could put subtitles in Spanish there are Latin fans!
Love how in all of his recent Star Wars appearances, Hayden is seen wearing black.
Will there be a Vader movie or series?
Loved every minute of it! I was grinning from ear to ear! They will always be brothers to me even through all that has happened! Brothers Forever!
Who crosses their legs? Get on with the real question lad
Bruh I forgot Ewan sounds like that lol. I always think of him sounding english
Cant wait for the auralnauts version.
At 4:25 you’ll begin to hear the fans chanting Hayden’s name. I got emotional when that happened. He deserves all of the love!
Bro I love Star Wars so much! It’s seriously one of the greatest universes ever. I love being able to grow up loving these characters and movies! Now to experience the characters head on is amazing! I’m so excited for more episodes!
Their outfits are the same color as what they wore in the movies!
Hayden had the best line "This is where the fun begins" I love them both!!!
很高興我經歷了這20年的輝煌
Obi-wan and vader rivalry is so phenomenal... I hope we'll get a season 2 ....  :(  :(
Hayden looks almost the same man! Awesome to see them again getting all the love they always deserved.
bruh, that guy at 2:36
Great that the crowd showed them so much love, but can we also agree that it's not ok to just yell things at people during interviews/panels? We're there for the people being featured, not for the randos in the audience that need to be acknowledged by them.
Disney is destroying Star Wars one show at a time
A bit of a missed opportunity on this Celebration was not taking advantage of the fact that you have so many actors who played the same character on animation and live action... It would be so cool to have chats with Hayden and Matt Lanter on Anakin, or Rosario and Ashley on Ahsoka, Dee and Temuera on Boba Fett / the Clones and so on. Maybe this could become a feature in upcoming celebrations?
Love how the memes of the Prequel Trilogy is what makes them such great films 😂
Notice he has his long anakin hair
It must be so strange having gotten so much hate and so much love at the same time. It must be nearly incomprehensible if you’re actually the one it all revolves around
So nice to see Hayden get the love he deserves for the wonderful way he portrayed Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader!!
Ayyyeee
Did they have Hayden wear all black and Ewan wear brown and white on purpose?
Love that their wardrobe matches the color schemes for their Jedi robes. Really cool but subtle nod to their characters.
I didn't know this was occurring (nor would I have cared) because two days before this, 19 children lost their lives in Uvalde Texas to an active shooter, 2 days before the end of the school year, and here these people are acting like nothing HAS HAPPENED!! This country is freaking unbelievable!! Go use your celebrity status and visit the families in Uvalde and support stricter gun laws!! Go be real jedi for traumatized children in Uvalde.🥀x19+2 adult teachers. I couldn't watch anymore past the first 2 minutes. 😭
This! These are my Star Wars characters! My childhood actors.   It’s like going back in time. This is insane!
It's so heartwarming so see Hayden and Ewan together getting love from the fans
Hayden is the best. I'm so glad time has finally vindicated him and that he's getting the respect he's always deserved. Ewan is of course a king among men as well
Cool interview, now drop Carboni, guy is a fascist
Ewan and Heyden outfit color just exactly same color as their Jedi outfit color.
I like how Ewan is wearing brown and white and hayden is full black haha
Vader's fun, not Kenobis🤣
That dude just flipping the red lightsaber in the back when the camera is on Ewan and Hayden. I see you bro, I seem them skills lol
Feels like just yesterday revenge of the Sith came out
Life is good right now let’s go Star Wars!!
My Dad became a Star Wars fan in 1977 and myself in 2010. We love it!
Super cringe...
Anyone else noticed they wore matching colors to their characters?
Buncha neeeeeerds!! I loooove it!!!
Awesome, wish I could have been there
Amazing how 20 years ago everyone thought the prequels were shite and now this......guess time's a great healer 😁😁😁
I’m sure there must have been some dialogue amongst the incessant cheering
This is so cool!
👏I swear being a 90's baby is the best we had the best cartoons tv shows and movies to grow up on ,Idk if any other generation will ever have it like we did🔥🔥💯
Hayden was so maligned by the fans for the bad Direction he received from George Lucas. George made Hayden into a "whiny" character.  George is NOT a good Director. As Carrie Fisher said, George's direction was "Faster, More Intense." Deborah Chow, on the other hand, will give Hayden quality Direction and hopefully will let him fill the boots of Darth Vader, closer to what we all saw in Rogue One and the fan film "Star Wars Scene 38 Re-imagined."  I hope Hayden blows us away!  May The Force be With Him.
I'm glad these guys are coming back! It's hard to tell if they genuinely want this because of there current lives behind the scenes . If they do want the work the work I'm sure it's a rewarding experience because a diehard star wars fan is a supportive one! I've been looking forward to this since it was first announced!
It's like the people didn't want to hear what they had to say
It's crazy to see Obi-Wan and Anakin, my childhood heroes back at it again. I'm so happy
I loved Hayden even back then! He has been perfect as Anakin Skywalker! I dont know why people gave him so much flack back then, it's great to see good reactions at least now people appreciate him
So happy …
I like Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi!
This video clearly shows that Hayden was never the problem with being Anakin (not yet Vader)... a lot of people failed to comprehend that he was Anakin before being Vader, that both sides of the character are totally different... Hayden, along with Ewan and Sam Jackson, was my favourite part of the prequels.
I enjoyed the first 2 episodes but if only 6 episodes it is moving to slowly for me.  If it was a normal show like 20-25 episodes then it would be fine which I so wish it would be. The Anakin/Obi Wan relationship and this timeline is the number 1 thing fans want to watch!!!
Anakin Dripwalker
You can see how much it really means for Hayden to be able to be here, to come back for his beloved character and how happy is because of all this love he's getting now. He's like a glowing sunshine😍 He deserves all of this appreciation and love! ♥️ Also, Obi Wan is my favourite character, but his relationship with Anakin is so much part of his identity that I couldn't be happier to see these two together! ❤️❤️
que dice el de la tribuna?
Man. I havent seen Hayden this happy in decades.   This is lit.
I feel sorry for the actors :D Those poor actors have to pretend they love Star Wars more than anything else in their life :D I am a fan too but I am a realistic fan because I understand what it means to be an actor... yes, actors probably like the film or the franchise otherwise they wouldn't pick up a role in it and I know that Ewan McGregor was/is a star wars fan but actors love acting and that means they love to play different characters in different genres in different movies + they also have their own private lives coz for them movies is work and so their private life isn't movies... (unlike for fans - star wars for fans is a hobby, for actors it's work :D ) I am sure they're happy to be back, have the attention, the money, job and I am sure they even enjoy it but I am sure that in private they must be like "ahh I am happy I've done more things that Star Wars and I even liked this and this film better" :D and the worst is that they know that if they do or say anything bad or show less excitement the fans who love them now will hate them in the next second. Coz fans are the most hatefull people ever :D :D
Can we just talk about how amazing this audience was? They gave Ewan and Hayden so much love and energy but were also so respectful of them, when Hayden started speaking the people chanting his name went SILENT
Yay WAR !  Vietnam , Afghanistan, Yemen Palestine Iraq Syria, Ukraine  STAR WARS  is a great way to teach children about conflict and not  peaceful resolutions. lets brain wash children NOW so they will be more accepting of future WARS when they are adults. nice job Disney
Finally Hayden and Ewan get what they deserve. Who could have imagined that 2005 after walking out of cinema
Imagine if Ewan came out saying "hello there" and Hayden ending with "this is where the fun begins". That wouldve been legendary, but at least we got one!
Hayden being smothered with love and admiration AS HE SHOULD BE <3
Love Hayden. Met him at the Star Wars con in Chicago along with ian mcdiarmid. Truly a moment I felt like I was dreaming and almost froze up while awkwardly trying to shake their hands before a photo. 🤣
So good to see Hayden finally grow into this role. He seems able to handle it now, more than ever. The dialogue he was given for Ep II, combined with his lack of maturity then, made for a bad combination. It was not until Ep. III that we saw the glimpses of what was to become the "real" Anakin. And now we finally get to see the start of the fully developed Vader. Kudos, and thank you to LucasArts/Disney for not giving in to the backlash from way back when...
Awesome
Let's be honest.. the most important thing Hayden Christensen ditched.. was George Lucas' terrible dialogue & writing.
Ben & Skyguy
Guys, they’re even wearing their Jedi colours!
2:35 anyone else see that guy in the background?
The prodigical son returns
"You Underestimate My Power" - Anakin Skywalker
ROTS is the greatest Star Wars film of all time
9:40
Wholesome af
Why didn't Ewan say "hello there"? :-(
Hayden Christensen is the worst actor. Why bring him back.
I really don't like the ones that yell out stuff in the background.
This is special
I didn't realize how much these two mean to me until they walked on stage and I teared up
Wait, how did I not know Ewan McGregor's uncle played Wedge Antilles!? I'm way too big of a Star Wars fan to have not known that!
Man Hayden is right this is where the fun begins
You know, Hayden really is perfect as Darth Vader. George chose him for a reason. He's exactly like Anakin, in that he has boyish charm and innocence, but he's also big and intimidating. Love that guy, glad he's a part of Star Wars.
Next Year: Natalie.
I love that these guys are reprising there roles. I just watched both episodes and honestly it's the best star wars has been since  Disney aquired Star Wars
I would love to see these two in a live action clone wars
10:28 Ewan has the high ground
2:35 guys in the back spinning his lightsaber and flexing his skills. i liked it
Love the style they brough! Ewan wearing modern day Jedi garb and Hayden with Sith garb, reminds of when they did it in That 70s Show for the Star Wars episode! Also, gotta say, Hayden's smile is just gorgeous! One of my favorite actors despite not being loved much in his roles I feel like he was this close to breaking out but I'm so happy he smiles no matter what
Oh man I teared up from the love and them 2 god bless the community and star wars in a whole
Dude Ewan thought he was going to enjoy his moment of fame in the spotlight and then people invite Hayden and it's like... xD Obi-who?
Like McGregor so much
Many will happily shout had Sir Ewan said to the fans, "Hello, there."
This video  %99 fans scream  %1 Hayden and Evan talk
I'm glad prequel actors like Hayden have gotten better reactions is just too bad it's too late for people like Jake llyod
God bless these two incredible men who built our childhoods
Ewan should start every interview with "Hello there"
I like how their wardrobe choices are the same colors scheme of their characters, with modern clothing, Ewing rocking the tan, brown, and white of the jedi and Hayden rocking the all black of the sith.
This is so good
I like Hayden is wearing all black like anakin/Vader and ewan has brown and white  like obi amazing
All those virgins that crapped on the prequels gonna eat thier words
Because we grew up and we’re able to make our voices heard, prequels are the best
Maybe these guys were a little to excited lol
Love seeing these guys get the love and recognition they deserve
❤️💙
I'm telling you, those stylists are doing a really good job to dress Hayden nearly always in black. It has that Vader spirit looming all over him!
9:39 this is where the fun begins
9:20 I MISSED YOU GUYS TOO
I hope Hayden makes this rock.  His talent is so much better then some of the roles he was getting.
my childhood hero’s and now my adulthood hero’s❤️
I had a genuine smile trough the hole video 🖤 is amazing to see all those peolpe screaming and vibrating over Ewan and Hayden with light sabers! I'm so excited for the show and so happy to see Hayden back!
i love how their outfits kinda coordinate with their characters :)
Love ❤️ star war movie so much can’t wait to watch the movie 🥹😍😉☺️🙏🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍👍👍
Video begins at 2:50
These two deserve all the love and admiration they’re receiving. Icons
i could watch this everyday
20 years, jeez. I had all the original saga on VHS except episode 3 I had that on DVD. I absolutely loved all 6 of those movies so when people said stuff like they sucked I was so confused
The host did a good job, well done
I am so happy they get the recognition they deserve, especially Hayden, you can see it does something to them.   My SW heart is melting, that ending was everything
Excellent host. Great choice.
im honestly disppointed ewan dint start with "hello there"
Such legends
This is nice 🤝🏼
“This is where the fun begins” 9:40
Is it just me or does Hayden look a little like Brendan Frasier in the thumbnail?
(No spoiler)the last scene of obi wan e2 was so awesome!i had goosebumps.the scene and the music in the background,so epic!go watch it now!
Make Force attax cards like back in the day
Bring back Force attax cards
I hope hayden finaly gets some love from sw fans.i always loved the prequels,but people disagreed with me,until they saw the sequels😂😂😂
2:36 some guy just did a saber flip in the back
this was awesome to watch. i kept catching myself with a huge goofy smile on my face. im so excited to watch this series, the first 2 episodes have been great so far, 4 more episodes to go of these favourite characters! then hopefully we see them more in other series, preferably sprinkled in
Ewan dresses exactly how Obi would have dressed
Ewan: "uh..."  Audience: *cheering"  Accurate
All I want to know is if James Earl Jones is voicing Vader.
I used to consider myself a massive Star Wars fan. I've literally read over a 100 Star Wars books and to me the prequels were great! To me, Hayden Christensen IS Anakin similar to the way that Hugh Jackman IS Wolverine. Over the years my love for Star Wars has been diminished as Disney acquired the company and in my opinion botched the franchise. However, seeing these two faces back has stirred old emotions I didn't even know I still had. I can't say what those emotions are but they are positive! A new hope has been rekindled! Thank you Hayden and Ewan
I have idolized Darth Vader my entire life. I never rooted for bad guys, but he was just incredible. Kenobi didn't have that same impact until the prequels and Ewan really reinvented the character. Thank you, gentlemen,  for somehow making my childhood cooler way into adulthood. I'll never forget you.
I Hated the new movies with a capital H.  😒  But they did make me adore the prequels so much❤
This is enough to make a grown man cry
I really hope we see obi wans, flashbacks to a new scene of him training anakin. Not what we have already seen in the prequels but I think that would be dope. Also he’s returning for ahsoka which will be so dope
Thank god were getting some good stuff after Disney nuked the extended universe. May never see the New Jedi Order and the Yuzhanvong but atleast the main material is getting good work done on it now.
Everyone here for Hayden and Ewan. I’m here for Anthony Carboni.
The guy in the background causally flipping his lightlsaber like a badass lol @2:35
The fact that Heyden got so much hate by the critics for his performance is crazy when you see how much the fans  really wanted him back and see him as the definitive Anakin Skywalker. Really happy for him.
Hayden looks like a bad deep fake of Mel Gibson. Lmao 🤣 🤣 🤣
The fans were just super awesome the entire interview. So much love and hype for the show and characters.
2:37 this dude in the back is going serious Sith-Mode there.
These guys are great 👍  So happy for the the well deserved love they are receiving!
Hayden deserves all the love he's getting now, as he didn't get much when the prequels were originally released. Good for him.
Hidden Sith lord at 02:37.  At last I will reveal myself to the Jedi. At last I will have revenge.
The Prequels are still terrible, but they have evolved into something you just have to push through so you can enjoy so much of the newer content. I am glad that Hayden is able to be welcomed by the audiences. It's too bad Jake Lloyd can't have the same fun at these events.
Man Star Wars has been so bad recently but I can’t help but be excited seeing them both together again
Lol is Hayden still ''alive'' hahah.
This is where the fun begins! That gave me goosebumps I ain't gonna lie 🎉❤
Am I the only one who found the episodes a bit disappointing
9:40
This is the best show on Disney plus and it's not just because it's the prequel actor's reprising there roles debroah chow has created a brilliant story , the depiction of obi one from a Jedi master and general to a a basic worker who's completely forgotten who he is is a work of genius . And Ewen portrays that perfectly. And his gradual reclaiming of himself is something I look forward to seeing. And seeing Hayden not as anakin but Vader is very very exciting
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💜😢👏👏👏👏👏👏👏Bravo 👏 👏 👏 ❤
Star wars fans are the best
Serious Bond 007 vibes from Ewan there 🤔
I want to meet both Ewan and Hayden if they can come to Texas.
LETS GO DUDE
Holy!!!!!!!!!!! Them both together again!!!!!! The duel of the fates music 😲😲😲😲😲😲🤩
Ewan looks great. Aged very well.
Ewan McGregor was exceptionally great casting for Obi-Wan. Plays the character so well and blends into Alex’s Obi-Wan seamlessly. Fantastic Actor!
Revenge of The Sith was my all-time favorite movie
Star wars is BACK.!! <3
Ahhhh my heart ❤️ Star Wars is Life 🙌🏽 wish I could be there 🇬🇧 but soooo so Happy this is live 🙏🏽
we need a Darth Maul series now
Love how he says his iconic line this is where the fun begins. That line will always stick with me forever. Hayden and Ewan are legends, icons, the reason why a millions of people get into of Star Wars. Their isn’t gonna be another Hayden or Ewan.
I hate the fact that Hayden got so much hate, he’s such an awesome dude
The love for Hayde was inevitable. After all for every star wars fan cannot imagine Anakin looking any different than Hayden himself
I love that both of them are getting the love they deserve. Us fans that were kids when their movies came out are adults now ❤️
The audience definitely would have picked them up if they where about to do a stage dive xd
Darth Vader  Vader Dark Vision liveaction please 🙏
good trick from the guy on the back with his red saber at 2:39'
I like how their suits reflect their characters costumes
CHILLS CHILLS CHILLS. Amazing how ewan and Hayden are back. They are literally my childhood!!😭
Anyone else hate Hayden’s tag-line for his name being “Darth Vader, Obi Wan Kenobi” Uhh no that’s f’n “Anakin Skywalker, ENTIRE Star Wars saga”
9:30
Good god, the crowd is insufferable.
It was great to find out Im born on the same day as Hayden, having liked Star Wars my whole life. He's like my astrological spirit brother or something. This makes him also Aries, Leo rising with Moon in Scorpio. This is an extreme light meets dark contrast which makes him quite literally born to play this role.
Hayden Christensen is a terrible actor.
This is almost unwatchable because of the crowd who keeps shouting. Why do people need to behave like monkeys in order to show their support?
4:25 hayden hayden hayden ahh man he so deserves that... so heartwarming to hear that and see him get that appreciation
Hayden is not old at all
10% interview 90% "WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
Shut Up!
I love these guys.
Hayden has a easy walk in the park as Vader.. He don't need to speak...
I love the girl who play princes Lea in the show...So sassy
Beautiful.
I'm 50 years old.  I saw ANH in the theaters in 1977, ESB in 1980, and ROTJ in 1983.  Saw TPM at a 3am showing in 1999, saw AOTC in 2002, and ROTS 3X in 2005.  Loved them all.  My oldest son is 10 years old and shortly after he was born, I grappled with one question - what order does he see these, release order, or chronological?  I went with release, so he could see it as I did.   Now, he loves it all, has seen every Star Wars series ever made, and we both share one thought - Hayden Christensen was unfairly criticized for YEARS and now, it's his time for redemption.   I am SO glad to see that guy back, embracing Anakin/Vader, and declaring himself a fan.   My 5 year old still doesn't quite "get it" but we're going to have a mass viewing sometime soon and ensure he's brought into the fold too.
Nobody really liked Anakin, but everybody loves Vadar 😂
I was born in 74 and grew up with Star Wars... My daughter's generation got the following 6 movies, my granddaughter's generation gets all that and all the new stuff now... Future generations will only ever know a life with Star Wars... THIS IS THE WAY ❤️
Hayden loving clone wars and rebels gave me life ong he's fantastic ❤
08:52 - what's the guy in the aud shout?
My entire childhood right before my eyes. This is just too awesome.
“This is where the fun begins” awesome!
I'm so happy to see Hayden finally getting the love he always deserved
I have such a big feeling that this is just the beginning. All the big stuff taking off since Mando. There's something big we have to be building towards and I am so pumped to see what it might be.
I hope this is gonna be gr8 show.
Absolute Legends!!
When you locate the beginning of the fun: 9:40
They both gonna achieve what Mark Hamil did. They are all legends. My time spent on this video is so worth it. Especially the last part where the fans cheered when Hayden said “ this is when the fun begins” .
I've had such a HUGE crush on Hayden!!!
They look better today than they did 20 years ago!
0:48 This time we'll take em together
McGregor 🔥
The first two episodes of Obi-Wan Kenobi was freaking awesome! Can’t wait for the rest of the season!
It makes me super happy to see Hayden getting love.
2:46 Ewan: uh- Crowd: **CHEERS**
It's so awesome to see Hayden not know what to do with himself initially lol dude you've always been loved take it in homie
ewan shoud've said "Hello There !" such a missed opportunity lol🥲
#fire_kathleen_kennedy
My child hood crush 🥹 Hayden 🫶🏻🥹
I love how Hayden is dressed in all black like Vader, and Ewan looks like a Jedi with his colors. Great attire!
Honestly I haven’t had this much genuine excitement for a Star Wars film, series, movie etc since Episode 3. I hope they can continue to utilize these characters, especially Darth Vader, in future series or films cause I know that’s what I want to see more than anything and I’m sure I’m not the only one.
Kinda depressing that people are so obsessed with getting shaky blurry camera phone footage of a recorded event that there was no applause when they walked out.
Hayden did not grow old!!! He has the Force!!! :)
Essentially the interview: "I'm gonna need you both to just talk and not look at the audien-"  *Fans begin screaming*
9:39 This is where the fun begins!
The look on Ewan's face throughout most of this interview reminds me of Mark Hamill's just before the release of "The Last Jedi", in that it looks like he knows how absolutely crappy the first 2 episodes are, and is worried the fans are going to riot before he can jet out of there.  From the ridiculous chase scenes where you can tell the adults are doing their best to NOT try and catch Leia while she runs from them, to the absolutely unnecessary shooting star press flips Reva uses to jump across a 5 foot span.  This show is running on pure nostalgia alone.  You can already see the reason Disney delayed the premiere a week and release the first two episodes at once, bc the first episode by itself offered zero buildup or a cliffhanger.  The 2nd episode's only saving grace was the shot of Darth Vader at the end.  For my love of the Prequels , Ewan, and Hayden, I'm still holding out hope that the series will finish strong and be a smash hit, but so many signs are pointing towards another "Last Jedi" fiasco.
I wish it wasn’t weekly episodes :( I was ready to binge watch the whole thing
I’m a proud Star Wars fan to see the heart warming and well deserved support that Ewan and Hayden received. I’m glad they know that those of us who grew up with the prequels loved the films and loved their work. Well done fellow Star Wars fans. Well done.
Hayden needs a Instagram bruh
Our kings are back 👑 ♥️
Why does Hayden Christensen now look older than Ewan McGregor?
2:37  The guy with the red light saber casually doing some sickmoves. 👌
I freakin love Hayden!!!!!!
I will admit to putting some hate onto the prequels. The things I didn't like about those movies had nothing to do with these two gentlemen. I always felt bad about how Hayden got treated after the prequels. He did his job to the best of his abilities. I am really happy that he is finally getting the love he deserves. I can't wait to see his performance in this show.
And all of the prequels sucked. Unless you watched them as a child they were horrible movies. Bad blocking, bad direction, bad everything.
They really need to make a clone wars live action film with these two.
I'm so happy seeing all these Hayden content. Speciallly with Ewan. I love all the love that they are receiving
If Ewan said hello there when he came out… the room would have exploded
Disney sucks so much !!! BUT, that's really great to see these two amazing actors again <3
Hayden was a childhood hero of mine. Glad to see him healthy, happy and continuing his success. Best wishes to both these great men.
omg!!
I think i'm about to cry!
Are we going to ignore the dude in the background at 2:37
All-Time Celebration moment right here
We need a Vader series staring Hayden!!
Ewan and Hayden together again I LOVE IT
PLEASE GIVE US A VADER SOLO SERIES!!!  WE WANT HAYDEN AND WE WANT APHRA! May The Force Be With You, Always.  Ya bunch of scoundrels.......
I loved the prequels as a kid and was heartbrokened when I heard the actors thought the fans hated the movies. Awesome to see them get the love they deserve ❤️
Hayden looks rattled by the warm reactions he's been receiving. It's so nice to see him smiling with the fandom
Hayden dresses in the same color pallet of his Jedi robes and McGregor dresses in the same color pallet as his, that’s great attention to detail 😭🙌🏼
YOU WERE MY BROTHER ANAKIN!!!!! XD! (?)
Kenobi is a great show!
This is where the fun begins.... just Epic!
we just gonna ignore homie in the back? 2:37
My god. Some of the things in the first two episodes were cringe. But wanting to see Obi-Wan and Darth Vader as an adult will make me watch every single episode.
May the force be with you
I'm over the moon with the release of this series. The critics will no longer speak on behalf of the fans anymore. I LOVED the prequels and Hayden's work. I saw them all on cinema back when I was 13, then 16 and finally 19. This brings back a lot of fond memories. I can't wait to see all the episodes
its gonna be a blast!!! totally!!!!
i like how they are both wearing clothes that represent who they are in the movies/show.
Can people just s**t up and let them talk
Seeing these 2 together again, really does it for me. 💯❤️ 💫
we love you hayden and ewan!!!!
Hayden is one of those actors that is genuinely loved like tobey maguire 👏👏
How much a fruit is the host?
🔥🔥🔥
Hayden was a great Anakin, I wouldn’t want any other actor to have played him
*visible happiness*
California social distancing at its finest
Larry Steve Kenobi aka Bonjo is awesome!
Awesome! Love Hayden...great hein is back.
Seeing such amount of love for these actor and their role is the most wholesome thing ever
Star Wars' crowd is so toxic omg 😲
2:33 to skip the yelling
Their clothing color choices look arranged, but if not, still pretty cool to reflect their characters.
5:35 for the win
The only true heroes in Kenobi 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
🥰🥰🥰🥰😊👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Ewan should start with “Hello there” and Hayden ends it with”This is where fun begins”.
Could the crowd let them talk without cheering every word?
Hayden has the best laugh I've ever heard.
I never didn't love the prequels.  I saw them from the start,  and I loved them.   As I got older,  some parts I started to skip over,  but there was never any hate,  and I was surprised, and confused when I finally figured out there was hate for these movies.  The same with the sequels.   When I saw all of them,  I initially liked them,  but later thought that they didn't stand up to repeated viewing,  but there was never any hate.   Especially for the actors.   They did their job.   Well.   Especially for what they'd been given.
I got chills!
Ewan and Hayden should do a SNL skit where Ewan sings "Your Song" to Anakin like he did to Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge. Except they'd be on Mustafar.
You know Hayden is growing his hair out for anakin again !!!!
This is why where here why where all fans because “Star Wars”
Amazing. 20 Years later and Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen are back on the screen again. YEAH! I was a kid when the prequel trilogy came out! Saw "Revenge of The Sith" in theaters when I was 7 years old.
Man, they are growing up so fast Star Wars are good movie/shows
The show is meh
I love how their outfits resemble the ones from the movies.
OMG ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡😮😮😮😱😱😱🤯🤯
For real. This is an amazing video. This concept had fans screaming in joy. Seeing their childhood actors in person instead of on a screen. Comedy also made it even better! I am excited to see Kenobi ep.3 holds..
See  you.  Ewan.   And.  Hayden
I love that finally they get to see how much we, as younger fans, loved them then and still do now.
L crowd
two hotties in a pod
Star Wars is not Star Wars without Obi-wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker
Hayden played a fake Bob Dylan in a movie.  I wish he actually played Bob Dylan in a biopic.
Wonder if they going to make a new hope remake , what does you guys think
Youre my Brother I love you😂
I've loved these guys and their characters since I was a kid watching them and it makes me so happy to see them get the love they deserve.
Jesus Christ saves!
9:25
To the audience behind: Can you please let them speak and answer the questions...? 😅😁
To think it’s been 20 years! I couldn’t imagine being an actor and coming back to a character I played 20 years ago. I also couldn’t imagine such an out-pouring of love from fans to do all this. This truly is an incredible moment in history. I am excited to see this mini-series in full! May the Force be with us all.
Liking the show so far, can't wait to see what's next! Even if it somehow turns out to be a disappointment I wish these two the absolute best in life! There's no reason to hate actors in a movie or series, they do what they can with the material they are given. It's sad that they had to endure hate for something they had no say over.
I kind of feel Hayden doesnt like to do this press stuff. But at the same time he's so incredibly appreciative of being there. doing this role again.. Since he hadnt much of a career lately. He's really grateful.
I disagree with the host. Anakin was better than Darth Vader
Doesn't anybody remember how awful Hayden Christensen and the prequels were? Even Ewan McGregor was weak and has now taken to pimping Air Travel (Expedia) during a pandemic and cryptocurrency. These two, I swear.
I've got a bad feeling about this
I like to think Hayden came to set and saw Ewan and he said, "Hello there"
2:37 The camera man was with him!
Ewan lives over the wall from me, nice guy
Where is the real star of the show? You know that black chick.
Cool interview...notice they are both dressed in the colors of their Jedi Characters...
Gosh shut up crowd
I’m happy for Ewan and Hayden to be back, and I really hope that Hayden get more roles after Kenobi
Love these two so I totally get it but I needed the audience to SHUT UP lmao
so hearthwarming moment! :3
kenobi is 4/10 why kill the grand inquisitor lol
Battle of the hero’s would have been a better intro
I don't think there is anything more epic than being introduced and taking the stage to Duel of the Fates. Mother of God...
Hayden: I am a fan now too  (5:06) Fans:  (stares in awe)
For some reason I have no sound. Anyone else experience this??
This made me so happy
🖤
Hayden deserves all of this 100%
he said it, he said the line
Their dressed like they were in the movies
What a perfect line to close out the interview. Also the pat on the back from both of them as they were leaving the stage, they are like brothers!
I love them smmmmm
The way they pat each other at the end... my heart. I love them so much
Ppl needs to let them both talk, it’s nice to see the love but cmon, let them talk
Come on Hayden, say the line...  "This is where the fun begins"  YEEEEEY!!!
So good seeing Hayden getting some love, he played Anakin so well and got crapped on by a bunch of troglodytes ….. I was the original new hope generation, my kids were the phantom series …. We love them all. Time that Maul and Vader had their own! Come on Disney …. Do It! ( Palpatine voice)
So far obiwan sucks so idk why anyone is clapping the Star Wars movies could have been better too
I'm so happy they are back together
They ask these guys the stupidest questions they've been asked a million times.  We wanna know what hayden thought of ahsoka and show him some prequel memes.
Anyone else remember when Trekkies were the cringiest fanbase?
I cried
It brings a tear to my eye to see them getting the love they always deserved, I grew up with the prequels and I always loved them and I always will welcome back guys we missed you 🥰
Annie did not age well
they put their arms around each other as they exited the stage. all the feels.
"this is where the fun begins"   HE SAID IT! HE SAID THE THING!
we love you Hayden!!!
Spider boys 4 life
Had a smile stuck on my face watching this
Now I want a live film of the clone wars
KENOBIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII and Anakin
Hayden waving to a fan at 8:15 was so wholesome 😂
neither of them have aged a day.... :O
Just watched both episodes of Obi Wan Kenobi….. I am absolutely amazed at what they have done with these characters so far. Hayden you will always be our Anakin/Vader and Ewan you will always be our Obi wan! Love you guys and thanks for all of your hard work and memories
2 goats
9:27 goated
When Hayden said "I missed you guys too" omg 💔
Hayden is fine as hell dude wow lol you look amazing
Hayden we always loved you.
This has to be the part of the journey! Two of the most iconic characters ever!!!!
Hayden looks so beautiful, so happy to see him back and apart of this as he should have always been <3
attack of the clones you mean revenge of the sith?
Woooo
Darth Vader should be named the most handsome man and Father of 2022! 🤭
People now are hyped that Hayden’s back. before a lot didn’t like how he played the role. It’s similar with Andrew Garfield returning as Spider-Man. Where were these people back then?
They haven't aged.
I love how Ewan is dressed in brown colors like a Jedi and Hayden wearing all black like Vader. 😍
This makes me happy
Love how dedicated he is, he watched all the animated stuff. Then you are a real professional!
This is cool!!!
that armpit sweat what a day for hayden for his character and himself to be back to one of the biggest franchise. You missed it
I hope Hayden's career will take off again! I do not understand that with his potential and his physique he did not explose! it's never too late and I wish him the best. He forms a sublime duo with Ewan🖤🖤🖤
as a kid i never understood why they hated hayden so much because anakin was always my favourite. Happy everyone is happy he is back
1M views in 3 days, let's go!!!!
9:26
9:40 you're welcome
It's great having them in Star Wars again!
Great stuff, almost as good as that new series of books called "Pivotal Universe". THAT is the next Star Wars for sure!!!
Seeing Ewan and Hayden put their arms on each other's back at the end there is possibly the most wholesome thing that I have witnessed in my entire life.
Nice obnoxious host.
The best part is that Hayden in 2022 sounds just like Matt lanter
Reva is making the show, not so good. I feel bad having to say that but it's difficult watching her character over do it.
Hayden danke das du uns Star Wars Fans noch eine zweite Chance gibst! Es gibt keinen anderen Anakin!
While Im familiar with the franchise and of course I've seen OG trilogy,  and teenager-me watched the prequels with friends, but Im not a SW super-fan... however, Im completely obsessed with seeing  Ewan and Hayden talking about this series.  Also- I was kinda sad that security at this panel wasn't a bunch of Stormtroopers lol
I've already watched the first 2 episodes and I still can't even believe this is happening. YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
9:26 is why you are here
Amazing...Incredible..A dream come true
Hayden hasn't aged at all ... so it seems!
9:38 No, I didn't cry.
9:38 No, I didn't cry.
I wanted to tell the fans in the audience to be quiet lol. The actors couldn't talk long due to having to stop for the audience to quiet down.
i finished the first two episodes and im already hooked!!! i love the characters and story and omg Moses Ingram!!! the Third Sister might me my favorite inquisitor now!! up until now my favorite was the Second Sister Trilla Suduri voiced by Elizabeth Grullon, they're both so cool and baddasses and i just love this show so much everything they're doing is just so right!
Did anyone notice the beskar table?
Legends.
I loved this but good god, this audience will cheer at anything.
Glad these two are getting shown some love, but jesus christ I wish they could actually answer some questions without getting interupted every 2 seconds
09:40 This is where the Fun begins!!
Why is this only 11 minutes
I love how even here Hayden’s wearing black representing his black robes in revenge of the sith and ewan is wearing white and brown like his robes lol
The prequels are more respected because we saw the swill they put out in 2019.
The best part of all "Hayden"  smiling 😃 and getting the respect he deserves 👏
Hayden almost started a riot when he said “This is where the fun begins”. Love it so much
Hayden is who I think of when I think of Anakin same why I think of Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man
2:34 dude how did he do that in the background
Loved the first 2 episodes of the new show. So glad to see Hayden back as well.
Dude they're wearing their jedi robe colors!
I love that they dressed in the colors of their character's robes.
Dont care who says what, Hayden Christensen is the PERFECT Anakin and Darth Vader
what are they chanting at 4:24?
This is just astounding. It feels like Anakin and Obi-Wan are having a fireside chat with the audience, while at the same time it’s Hayden and Ewan.   These actors shaped my childhood for the better and I’m so delighted to watch the series and get to know their characters even more closely.
One of my clearest childhood memories is watching Phantom Menace on the big box TV we had and playing the RotS video game on the tiny little screen beside it. The best of times
I feel so sorry for Hayden.  Seeing how he acts in public, in front of the audiences and in Interviews nearly breaks my heart... I just wanna give him a hug...
Am i the only one who expected gregor to say "hello there"? Just me? Okay
When Hayden walk out you can see him saying wow to himself. I know he’s been out of the spotlight and living life, I hope he always remembers how much the fans love him
This proves that a lot of people need to get a life. :-D
Idk if anyone noticed but their outfits is the same color scheme as their costumes in the show. Black for Darth Vader and Ewan with his Jedi brown robe. So hyped!❤️
Im not sure if its just ironic or planned, that Hayden is dressed completely in black, and Ewan is dressed in brown and white for this....
Americans 🙄 just let them speak
HELL YEAHHHHHHHH!"
Hayden looks exactly the same as when he was acting Anakin in 2005
ge dari yang syd sel ss ju l l beretik ir., j b a j l l
Ewan in brown, Hayden wearing black. Perfect
I feel happy for Hayden that he now get the love he deserved for playing or characterizing this role Anakin aka Darth Vader. I really feel how important that is for him.
Hayden🙏🏻
Legendary! I'm ecstatic having watched the first two episodes and seeing these two legends return! This interview warmed my heart, Hayden and Ewan deserve it!!
That crowd was the best crowd i've ever seen! When they started chanting Hayden's name i got chills
Please please come back Hayden !! You was my Darth Vader FOREVER!!!
I love the love Hayden received from fans Ewan deserved it too but I think Hayden needed to hear it.
you known force is strong with them.... no more to add
Perfect
As a happy as I am that this show exists and that it’s so good so far, the thing that makes me the most happy, is that Hayden is getting so much love and appreciation from the fan base. He got knocked around so much for so long about the prequels, I’m really happy that he can go through life knowing that his contributions to the sage and the character is loved, appreciated and cemented forever.
so fitting for ewan to wear white and brown like his jedi robes, while hayden is all black lol
This was just 11 minutes of ear to ear smiles for me. My favorite two actors and characters from all of SW, seeing them again is a treat. And Hayden is a treasure, bless his heart.
You love to see it
I'm crying
9:39 this what you are looking for
Best redemption arc I've ever seen, they deserve ALL the live they get, they are the heart of Star Wars.
The host is a major fruitcake. Could’ve been better.
ewan mcgregor looks like chad kroeger😆 never realized before🤣
I love that their outfits correspond with their characters. Hayden in the all black (representing Vader), while Ewan is in the brown and white (representing Kenobi).
Aaaahhhh, these men are legends!
Big thumbs down because of the annoying fans! Sorry!
The fans give you the rank of master Hayden
Hayden is the BEST
ANAKIN!!! 😢💖💗
I love seeing Ewan and Hayden back on stage together again.
2:38 that guy definately used the force
It would have been equally funny if he had said "I have a bad feeling about this", though honestly I have a very good feeling about this.
Whenever I merge on the highway in Columbus I always say, “this is where the fun begins!”  Haven’t been in a wreck yet. May the force be with you
It just makes me happy to see these guys get the love they have always deserved.
getting emotional about the love hayden is finally receiving:’)))) it’s his andrew garfield moment
underrated duo
I KNOW IT, YOU KNOW IT, WE ALL KNOW IT, WE ONLY COME TO SEE WHEN HE SAYS: "THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS" :V 9:39
I get the crowd are excited but damm they’re annoying, let them talk
“This is where the fun begins!” Amazing!!
Impressive, most impressive moments!
ppl used to not really love Hayden this much, social media make the hate easier to express and troll or harass celebrities, what I'm getting at is if ppl now don't hate Hayden that much and kinda miss him now, it could happen the same with daisy(Rey) in 20 years? or maybe it's just a matter of we appreciate Hayden more now as the sequels really sucked?.
I got a good feeling about this
finally the recognition Hayden deserves for a long time. He's so sweet. This was incredible.
How boss was the!! "Now the fun begins"
Guy in the back at 2:36 isn’t getting enough attention
9:19 "I missed you guys too" 9:40 “This is where the fun begins”
After Star Wars Episode 7,8, and 9, suddenly the fans realized that the prequels are gold. :D
I only see lord Vader and master kenobi
Need an ID on that jacket.
The prequels are unjustifiably being hated, many of the critics toward prequels are nitpicking.
the are like the fountian of youth. they dont look like 20 years have passed at all. ewan look younger
I'm sure Hayden was nervous before he came in here, he probably let Ewan know, you know, the criticism, the memes, his own disappointment, considering that he's a VERY private celebrity all that past affected his career. I am glad that the fans received him with tremendous respect, reverence and above all affection, because he is a great actor, that pat on the back that Ewan gave him is seen as "everything is fine!"
Hayden Christensen saying this is where the fun begins maybe the most iconic thing in Star Wars Celebration history. Man belongs in the spotlight thank god he’s back.
love that the table is beskar
Childhood restored
This almost made me emotional man Hayden looks so happy!! The abuse he got all those years ago you can see on his face at points he’s unsure how to emotionally respond to all the LOVE! And honestly it’s so heartwarming ❤
I'm incredibly happy for Haydn that he has this chance to enjoy the series in a new way.
Hayden is such a well spoken dignified young man. Soo nice to see.   Ewan is a gentlemen as always.
Can’t wait to see jar jar again
The summer of 1977 this all began.I remember standing in line for hours in the hot sun.Then to sit in a cool theater watching the imperial star cruiser rumble across the stars...the Saga continues!
It's wonderful to have 2 characters back from the original Star Wars world.  Both have the chance to revive this world.  I am very happy that they both accepted. They are back 😉👍
No
Love how their outfits resemble their characters robes
we not going to talk about the guy in the background with the red lightsaber?  2:37
Literally rock stars of space & planet Earth 😩🫶🏽
@2:38 guy in the back really showing off with the red saber. haha
These two were wuch a HUGE part of my childhood and brought me comfort in hard times. It makes my heart so warm to see them back at it and getting the love they deserve. Thank you Ewan and Hayden for being amazing actors that brought to life the most memorable star wars characters since the first movie. I love them.
"This is where the fun begins" souned awsome! But I think we all are still waiting for "Hello there!" from Ewan 😄
I’m in the background of this hahahehehehehahaha
Absolutely love seeing Hayden finally getting the respect he deserves.  Guy is Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader, the most iconic villain in cinematic history full stop.
They’ve hardly aged
Convinced they don’t age
THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS!!!
I’m still waiting on the sequel to Jumper! That’s one of my favorite movies from back in the day and I loved Hayden in that role, shame that people don’t think that Hayden can act. It’s also SUCH a shame how many people seemingly crucified him when in reality he gave us the best Anakin for what he was given to work with! Love that I’m alive to see my childhood come back like this in full force 😭
This was a great host. He made it easy and comfortable for the two and hyped up the audience the right way.
Hayden looks like he could be Henry Cavill's little brother.
Anakin Dripwalker  Drip Vader Hayden Dripstensen      The drip is strong in this one
Said his name wrong. It's not Christiansen, it's Christensen. What a moron.
it was a mistake to put the audience so close to them because they could barely get an answer out  put those animals behind a fence next time where they belong
For me Star Wars is more then just a franchise it’s literally my childhood I’ve grown up with Star Wars and it’s giving me so much joy now I’m so exited for this whole show
9:40
I shaked hands with Hayden and got a signature!
I was 8yrs.... and in love with Hayden 🤗🤗🥰
star wars is super dumb.  move on people. you are duped by a fantasy world teaching you occult world view. deception
After years of bad star wars contents, this is truly where the fun time begins
❤️❤️🥺
the crowd doesnt sthu
*This is where the fun begins.*  *Hayden smirks.*  I LOVE BEING A STAR WARS FAN.
@9:40 Good lord that gave me intense goosebumps. Welcome back Ewen and Hayden!!
Now that's Vader for sure!😈
Hayden is the first person to break the sound barrier without moving
Brings back memories, ROTS was my first star wars movie and my favorite out of all the saga❤️
Yessssssssss 👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋
I’m glad Hayden can finally see in real time that he is still a Legend he is still loved and that is never going to change.  Even decades later.
Ahhhh okay I see the color scheme that Ewan and Hayden got going on
this is epic
It is so good to see them get recognition and love.
I WAS THERE FOR THIS
2:37 did anybody see that dude spin his lightsaber in the back? Impressive 😂
I literally almost cried on “THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS”.  I’m so happy these guys reunited for another story. I am 20 years old and I feel like 7 again!!!
5:36 (& 8:53) What'd they say??
Hearing everyone so excited to see Hayden makes me so happy. I wish I could understand what all those people were shouting
Two legends
The prequels were hugely underrated. There was mega hype for them on release, it was soured for many because of Jar Jar Binx and little Ani it wasn’t what fans at the time were expecting. It was for a new generation so you had to accept it needed a quantity of kiddie stuff to get new young fans. Yet if you compare the latest trilogy they aren’t a scratch on the prequels. The prequels had a story and plot, proper battles and fights and made sense.  I just hope this Kenobi series does really well, maybe encourage other spin offs also. And if they can’t scrub out the last three STW films and remake then properly (which they absolutely could do) they can at least move forward with new characters prob mixed in with some descendants of older characters. So many directions they can take, if they made gritty films like Rogue One with epic lightsaber duels etc it’s an instant cash cow.
Should have named it " Obi Woke Go Brokebi"
Fingers crossed they do more series with these 2
So happy to see Ewan and Hayden together again. It has been a long time coming. This is what Star Wars is all about. All the love there for these Terrific and Awesome guys. This just warms my heart. Sending them Big Hugs!
2:37 guy in the back nailed it with that rad blade
So happy to see these two get the love they deserve. Hyped for the show!
i understand anakin
Notice how they dressed as there characters Ewan In brown and white like kenobi and hayden with full black tuxedo like anakins armor
Good to know Anakin missed me also 😂
“You’re like brothers!”  Hayden: “Yes, yes we are”  God bless that fan! ☺️
2:36 check that flex from the guy in the back.
This makes me so happy
I love how they’ve been wearing colours that match their characters for all of their interviews!
the beskar table is actually nice lol
I would be nice if the crowd would shut up so they could talk.
The hype for Hayden and M is real?
So heartwarming to see all the love for Hayden.  The Prequels look like absolute masterpieces next to the Disney Sequels.
If they announce battlefront 3 one of the days that would be epic
Like the better part of this interview is just a standing ovation...
I made lightsaber props for these two on the prequels, we had a lot of fun making those films... am so pleased to see them back together. lovely guys.
I want to lick Hayden's curls.
Yesssss 👍👍👍👍💪👌😎
Why does he look older than Ewan lol?
I freaking love you Hayden, so glad you're back. Own it!
This makes me smile from ear to ear
Wow I watched all the other interviews from this day first, and the crowd is NUTS here, for good reason!
I love that Ewan keeps his genuine accent when in the US (unlike Liam Payne... what a joke!).
In all seriousness, I can fully see hayden growing into the character of darth vadar. The 20 year time gap has deepen his voice and maturity for the role. PERFECTION 👌
That host is quite possibly the most irritating man on the planet.
I'd like to shake both of their hands
oh my God! 'this is where the fun begins' is such a classic I love it I made me so happy! I'm fangirling oh my God!!❤️
I love how right before he says the line, Hayden looks at Ewan like, "Should I? Should I do it?" and Ewan just looks back at him like, "Do you know how many 'Hello theres' I've spoken since we started this press tour? It's your turn."
This trilogy through Hayden's career into the sarlac pit, hope he can redeem himself because he's actually a decent actor.
Can't what tell net epasoued
i got into star wars like a 4 days ago and i got so close to kenobi and anakin and im so happy to see them together again :(
I love how much love they are getting
While it happened a little, I'm glad the fanbase didn't go overboard with the interruptions WHILE they were speaking. That stuff gets obnoxious when it happens too much.
Oh my god the crowd is so incredibly annoying and braindead. You don't have to scream after every 3 words they say.
The audience would never react like this for the Sequel Trilogy cast 😂 speaks a lot
9:19 my heart is full! 9:40 the inner 5 year old in me from 2005 shed a tear
These guys know how to work this particular crowd. I wonder how it feels to know you can walk into a group of people and make them go nuts by saying a particular handful of words?   Welcome back you two. We love you :)
Ewan dressed in brown and white, Hayden in black. Not a coincidence.
GOATS
MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU ALL
The Obi-Wan series is boring and amateurish and doesn't compare to The Mandelorian in any way.
I think Hayden is the perfect role to recreate or recast the character of Paul's 'Brian O' Connor' in F&F franchise
Hadghdin
Omg I love these actors !! I am so excited for the new series
Definitely teared up at 9:30
3:57 Hayden Christensen: Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi
Watched the first two episodes today. As someone who only watched the first Disney Star Wars movie I’m actually excited about Star Wars again lol
Iv'e just realised that Hayden Christensen has a look of Henry Cavill in the face.
I'm so happy to see Hayden and Ewan again for the first time in 17 years.  I was 15 years old when I first saw the trailer for Star Wars Episode 2 in May 2002 and with it Hayden.  I'm 35 years old now and I still get happy when I see them both.  The greatest idols of my youth.😍😍
What spoilt star wars celebration was the motor mouth Kathleen Kenedy the sooner she's gone the better
No one even looked at them with their own eyes, everyone  is recording 🤦🏻‍♂️
Both of them look great for their age 👌
I love how for this press tour Ewan always dresses in natural earthy colours, and Hayden always dresses in pure black. Not coincidence.
This is the only popular video. Lucusfilm won't care.
Watched both episodes. Its absolutely wonderful.
Love how they both are wearing their Jedi colors 👌🏽
That was definitely a wholesome interview 😁
The lightsaber twirl at 2:37 though.  The fact that these two came back for this is amazing. What a great first two episodes.
Peep the sith in the background 2:36
The first 2 episodes were horrible and now I really don’t like Princess Leia anymore
The return of the King
“Disney’s firing of Gina Carano is confusing and hypocritical, lacking sound management.” - Forbes  Only good things can come from #FireKathleenKennedy #makestarwarsgreatagain   "It seems to me that Kathy Kennedy and J.J. Abrams don't have a clue about Star Wars. They don't get it." - Marcia Lucas   #firewhoopigoldberg #cancelwhoopigoldberg  #justiceforjohnnydepp
Ewan made a great point - the prequels were always loved, especially by my generation (millennial). There wasn’t a way for the audience to communicate directly to the people who made the movie when the prequels released. As soon as there was the prequels “suddenly” were beloved.
The mouse is supposed to amuse us not to tell us how to raise our children, And what's up with may 4th ? The mouse squed us on that too
Lol that one guy that yelled “you’re my brother” 😂😂 idk if he said “their like brother”
7:31 Is that laugh real? Cool seeing them together again.
California!!!!!!!!!
Looking back at the movie jumper !! How the years flew by 😏
Where's Queer Gon Jinn? This is Disney/Lucasfilm.
OMG IS THAT ANTHONY CARBONI he use to have a youtube channel called nature hates you i loved that channel  man that was a long time ago   so this is what he has been up to ;0
I am so happy to see Hayden.
Reeva is a generic & Woke Character
The men the legends!
You can tell they really love their fans and are so happy to be able to come back.
HE SAID THE THING
Not big on star wars kore but just finished the first 2 eps. Were pretty good
I love these two!  Hey drink feces #2! How r u
Maybe people are finally realizing it was the dialogue and not the actor..... :\
Since when is Christensen an icon or even an actor🤔🤦‍♂️  Star wars, you're insulting a large part of your fans by letting this failure play again and spoil star wars again with his non-authentic role, especially letting him play next to the real icon McGregor.... what a shame of you👎
Ewan and Haden blink the crowd goes nuts.
Nobody gonna talk about the bubble that said Hayden played earth Vader, obi wan kenobi?
Hayden can force choke me anytime 🤣🤣🤣
The host is wearing h&m pants /joggers
Prequels are some of my fav movies all time
Finally, the prequel generation can make our voices heard and let these two know how much we've loved them all this time!
Where is Jake Lloyd???? Why isn’t he getting any love?…… is he an angel now???
I'm happy to see Hayden and Ewan together again, it's just awesome I love the Prequels I grew up with them.  I really miss the legit brotherly bond between the two and seeing Hayden kinda relishing this moment with the "This is where the fun begins" line and the POP he got was insane.  I really want Hayden to succeed  as Anakin/Vader please SW fandom don't let him down 🙏
Man i love the New Star Wars stuff. Its more realistic and serious.
What does the guy at 5:36 say? I can't really hear it  P.S: I am so happy they are back! I love them, and their work...they deserve all the love and cheers that come their way!
The crowd is so annoying
Neither of them have aged. At all. Wth?
I love how Hayden showed up in all black and Ewan with the brown jacket and white pants haha
5:36
From Sith Lord - to Meme Lord... We love you Hayden! This indeed is where the fun begins.
Wish the interviewer would have kept the crowd under a control a little bit. The excessive call outs were too much and cringey
As much as I still despise the Sequels these days...I have to admit, they brought the potential for Star Wars outside media to boom again. And boy howdy, are these shows doing it.  Fallen Order brought up the rear too, and lots of fifth/sixth gen video game ports to boot and SWTOR still kicking around. Not everything is going to be an absolute banger, but that's okay, because that's how it always was.  It'll be a see-saw, one we share together.  The Sequels walked...and tripped...and fell into a Sarlaac pit, so Mando and the shows could run in my eyes.
The first two episodes were phenomenal. That said, no matter how it ends, Thank you Ewan, and Thank you Hayden. Especially Hayden for finally getting the credit he deserves.
This must’ve been so healing for Hayden 😭💜
It is like I am looking at my father and my older brother (which I don't have).. These people are FAMILY
Liam neeson needs to be in the kenobi series
Ahhhh!!! I’m so happy for them
I hope Jar Jar makes a comeback :D
I like Hayden character
😁😁😁😁😁
Proud to be a Star Wars fan! Ewan and Hayden are the best!
2:37 anyone else see the guy do a saber flip?
Can't believe I was in that crowd, such an awesome moment to see these guys get the love they deserve in person
True Legends
This crowd is so annoying lol
The fact that these binged The Clone Wars AND Rebels is so unbelievably heartwarming and means so much to me! My childhood was built on those shows! The fact that they love and appreciate those shows now is so meaningful!😭
“This is where the fun begins”
When Hayden said this is where the fun begins the audience reaction oh wow
"Anything you want the fans to know?"  "I dont like sand"
💖✌
"This is where the fun begins !!" Hayden, you're a  *L E G E N D*
the lightsaber flick at 2:36 tho
How do they both look so incredibly fresh
Bro the croud
Why does it sound like he’s calling Ewan Uwin
The audience made this interview unwatchable, so annoying, I am glad they are excited but aren't they there to actually hear the interview....
Did Hayden Christensen ever learn to act? Should have used CGI.
This is magical, no other way to put it.
Seriously?  This?  for Star Wars, it's garbage.  It was never that good and I can't even finish the last few movies.
All the haters of Hayden are now in their 40's and 50's. And we who loved him as kids are now in our 20's and 30's.
Absolute sports doing all this press for fans, haha
Literal chills!!!
2:38 the guy behind Hayden and ewan does a sick trick with his red lightsaber
The fact that they played duel of fates when Hayden and Ewan arrived on the stage 🔥
"This is where the fun begins" - Hayden, you just made me cry out of joy, what a legend of Star Wars! Blessed to have you back as Anakin/Vader! May the Force be with you, old friend!
I went my 'Hello there!'
The best! My childhood / preteen come to live. Thank you You are the best 💕
Warmed my heart seeing this. Love that Hayden and Ewan got to do this
I sat behind Hayden on the flight coming back from Berlin years ago, he had a camera man sat next to me, I wondered why there was a film camera in the luggage compartment above
Prequels still sucked along with the Sequels but I’m glad they’re back with Chow at the helm.
2:37 can we just talk about the dude with the lightsaber for a second
"fAn wAnT nEw cHaRaCTeRs"
Once they were hated  For too long they were cast aside by so called "fans" But now they too are headed to the promised land
Lol dude I’m the background at 2:37
I love Hayden Christensen!!!!! 😁  I hate Reva!!!!!!😁
Ewan's and Hayden's friendship feels so real ! Love them!
We need series in the Clone Wars Time, with Hayden/Anakin, Ewan/Obi-Wan and Rosaria/Ahsoka, that would be so epic. But Hayden and Ewan together, it makes me so happy to see them after 20 years.
They're wearing the colors!
To see Hayden and Ewan makes me so happy.
Ooh my 😍😍😍😍
4:20 is Hayden chant for whoever wants to know
they even dressed as their characters without wearing costumes!!!!!
Carboni!!!
I'm just super glad that Hayden is getting the Brendan Fraser treatment by the internet. Both men are forever a part of our childhoods and the nostalgia we get from them will never die, it will only grow larger with time. They deserve to know just how much everyone loves them.
9:38
I do really crave that Ewan could stand on that stage and say “I got the high ground!!” lololol
So lucky to have been there for that seeing them together again is still so surreal
Bro I’m crying right now
Ewan didint say "hello there" :(
Love Hayden, but Matt is my Anakin.
I just watched the first 2 episodes and I can’t wait until this season continues
I love Hayden Christensen
This is where the fun begins! YEAAAAAAAHHHHH 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Scene starts with a literal school shooting a week after one of the worst massacres against children. If this isn't tone deaf I don't know what is. I was horrified and shocked. DISCUSTING
Great to see the excitement, but man that crowd is interruptive
I couldn't watch due to the morons in the crowd constantly screaming like school girls.
Haven't enjoyed any star wars content (other than the Vader scene in Rogue One) since the prequels... but I am LOVING the Kenobi series so far!! It felt like when I went to see episode 1 in the cinema when I was 8 years old all over again watching Kenobi now at age 28!!
fans need to shut up sometimes, let them answer the questions in peace
The fact that Hayden has been wearing mostly all black to all these recent interviews plays as a toast to his iconic character of Darth Vader.
Our childhood heroes
hayden is my childhood hero. I never understood why he got so much hate. When I was a kid he played a character that i couldnt stop thinking about. now im in my 20s and it's amazing to see all the love that he is getting. he deserves it so much. I love this guy. Shaped me as a person
Take a shot for every “This is where the fun begins” comment
They didn't age much. The force preserved them I guess lol
Literally tears are falling from my eyes i love hayden so much
1:20 you can see a person dressed as Ashoka in the bottom left corner
kings
I'll say it star wars timeline is wacky then marvels but its amazing.
if the crowd would shut up for two seconds and let them talk.
It’s so heartwarming to see Hayden and Ewan get the love that they’ve deserved and missed out on for 20 years!
yeaaaaa he said it the fun yessss THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS
Hayden seems to be a little nervous
It is so good omg!!!!!!!
Que bonito todo el cariño que están recibiendo los dos. Los quiero mucho! 🥺🫶🏻
#tearsofjoy
People yelling is so anoying. Hayden/Ewan: Whatever. People there: WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO YEEEEEEEEE WUUUUUUUU Just calm down guys.
I'm so happy for them. It took some time, but they're finally seeing how much people love them and the prequels. Their duel in ROTS never fails to make me tear up. Peak star wars right there
I see these 2 every day after work on battlefront 2, get carried
Well...so much for the threat of COVID. Amazing how quickly the wu flu worry goes away when there's a celeb in the room that the little simps can worship,
Why is everyone saying iconic, iconic this iconic that......SILENCE!!!
two living legends!
Glad to see them back
5:35 - "You were my brother" - Obi Wan
The crowd annoyin ngl
Anakin have so much charisma and btw he didn't take any aging
I know the people there are excited but shut up and stop screaming.
I probably wouldn't be as accepting as I am of Hayden reprising the role of Vader had I not seen the eye through the broken mask when Vader fought Ahsoka.
Aw, Hayden is really taking it all in. Really wholesome to see it.
What an annoying host.
6:35 I know people are excited but that's just rude.  Let the dude speak.
Im sure this is also about redemption for Hayden. I mean Ewan was already a big star and continued to be one after those terrible 90s Star Wars movies, but I think those films really had a negative impact on Hayden's career. It's really a shame those movies were so awful, I even tried watching them again after the new movies (which weren't amazing themselves, but still light years better than the 90s ones) and I just couldn't get through them. I hope this series lives up to the hype.
У Юэна голос не такой, какой в русской озвучке Оби Вана. Вот голос Хейдена похож
Cringe crowd wow
The question is…. Is Hayden actually gonna wear the suit? Or is someone else gonna wear it like a stunt double and Hayden voicing Vader
So amazingly awesome to se these guys back together again ! 🤘🏻❤️❤️❤️
This is where the fun begins brought tears to my eyes omg can’t wait!
Getting all these cheers Hayden is probably thinking you are the same people that trashed my career because of these movies.
This crowd is full of people with severe "I'm the main character" syndrome. For the love of god, let the people we're here for speak.
hello there
May the force be with you.
Hayden the goat of starwars
These 2 men are the absolute bollocks
Anakin look good here playing hayden
ah this 60 fps - a blessing for my eyes
Star Wars Celebrations (Day 2) .....the fun continues.
This is what Star Wars should be: A whole family. Criticism is alright but hate and disrespect of actors (looks at Sequels) is just horrific.  Star Wars gives us hope in tough times, that's why it will always be in my heart.
I loved the prequel trilogy, and I'm really glad to see that magic back again!
I like how they're dressed like modern obiwan and anakin
All I see is nerds
Apparently no one like Star Wars anymore….. begone haters!!!
ngl i teared up when they all started "hayden!" he deserves this so much it's been so long.
Ewan and Hayden ageing like fine wine. Guess that jedi training pays off.
Major Thor and Loki energy
Ewan and Hayden : *breathing*  Crowd : WOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAHWWWOOOOO
have they even aged ?
Seeing these two VERY well-known actors who played as their ICONIC roles again, is a Star Wars fans’ dream come true! Hello there, this is where the fun begins!
It's so awesome to see Hayden get the love and adoration that he's deserved from the start. Knowing the level of criticism he got in AotC and RofS, and then seeing him walk onto stage and hearing the crowd explode is just amazing.
I love how 50% of this interview is just fans cheering
AND Hayden dressed in all black (Vader) and Ewan dressed in traditional Jedi colors. Come on! 🙌🏼👏🏼
Really great to see Hayden back. One of the best things Disney have done for Star Wars is reuniting these two.
They still look exactly the same!
Fun fact: Ewan and Hayden's clothes match their characters
Keep it comin baby!!!!!
I dont understand the criticism for Hayden, he did great as a young anakin, all the hate was wrong, it was the movies in general that werent that great, they were ok but to much cgi and the story went off, aldow they tied up okish, loved the first obiwan kenobi episodes
So now we’re celebrating the demise of STAR WARS?
😁🤣💥🌌
Iconic moment for a Star Wars fan
Warms my old black heart seeing Hayden get the cheers he always deserved.
This is possibly the most painful thing to watch, because the audience doesn't know when to shut up and just let them talk.
I haven’t seen this much energy from a live interview ever in my life. It reminds me of a live NHL or NBA game with that crowd wow. These guys might just be the 2 most beloved characters of any movie franchise ever
The host is so annoying
“This is where the fun begins”  * Hayden on screen for 2 seconds while Ewan doesn’t use his lightsaber a single time. *
Is it wrong that I watched this through streaming tears of joy?
I'm sooo excited to see Ewan and Hayden back together!!
Hayden got so old
Hayden: oh now y’all miss me?
I'm so happy for them, can't wait to watch the whole series
9:37 Perfect
EVERYONE Loves Hayden, he got so much flack but Id not want another Vader x
So are we not going to talk about the clothes they're wearing? Jedi and Sith attires in the real world lol
Excited for the series. This was tough to watch. Let the actors speak.
Random guy in the crowd *..."You're like BROTHERS!"   Hayden:..yes ..yes we are 😎
If only Ewan said hello there at the beginning
“YEAH!”
I love how happy and positive everyone is, from the crowd to the interviewer to the actors. And the way Ewan and Hayden pat each other on the back when walking away is awesome
Was hoping Ewans first words would be “Hello there”.. can’t wait for the series to come out!
If I had one complaint, they should have played Anakin vs Obi-Wan when they came on
Ewan McGregor during the interview: "visible happiness"
even the table was Beskar !
Hayden played the role perfectly in the prequels,just as Lucas envisioned it.
Man my heart just like jumping crazy inside my chest right now
God. No wonder the Beatles got sick of the American audience.
lol can the crowd just shut up and stop yelling things
Equally hyped to see all 3 of those wonderful bois
It’s crazy how much Haden at this age looks like a younger Liam Neeson.
The crowd needs to shut up and let them talk, so annoying after awhile, like we get it, u cheer at everything
Hayden's problem wasn't his acting, it was the director and the writing. What was he going to do with the garbage the prequals was.
Legends of film
Imagine there is Vader's breath and then "This is where the fun begins" continue breathing.
Its so nice to see hayden getting this treatment in the fandom, always was a supporter of his, cant wait to see vader throw down
For some reason I see Mel Gibson in Hayden’s face during this 🤣🤣
Anakin thinking to Padme in Thor outfit with Mjollnir: "This is where the fun begins"
The fans couldn't contain their excitement. They should of just been given a couple of dueling lightsabers and just played around with eh music in the background
Who's chopping onions?!
The crowd is insane.  Alot of fans didn't like anakin . There not saying that now are they . I always thought the prequels told a good story . Cant wait to watch this series tonight.  The only star wars story worth telling
Ewan and Hayden are dressed in the colours of their characters' outfits. All dark and black for Anakin and brown, grey and white for Obi-Wan
these 2🤩
"I missed you guys, too." 😭
Best bonus would be if Mark Hamill appeared and said: Hi dad, long time no see.
9:39 YES!!!!
I wish I could tell the both of them in person how amazing it is and how much it means to me seeing them both together again!
Just get Cody and Rex in the background would be perfect. 😃 this is where the fun begins brilliant 😂 they are so much calmer than I would of been Ewan should of come on and said hello there 😂
Star Wars is so beautiful
Wooooooioioooooooo
Sinn ils arrivent à en placer une sans que le public crie mdrr ?
The prequel love is real
I like the way at 6:22 he says theyve grown and stuff and appreciate it more but they arent they just like it more because of nostalgia arent people sick i love the movies ever since they came out and if ur a star wars nostalgia fan then u are not
Here you go,  9:40
Damm so this could of been a movie.
The fans love 2:47 Ewan McGregor. But they loves 4:08 Hayden 4:24 Christensen 9:40 even more.
Star Wars fans are cringe. Shut up, let them speak.
Would love to see the watching of this with ya @star wars theory  ... feeling the love and joy in these iconic men and their roles to SW
We need another film with Anakin and Obi Wan Kenobi
Did you notice that their colors of their outfits match their jedi robes?
Leggendari moment in cinema history
It's like the second coming of The Beatles
The true chosen one has spoken “this is where the fun begin”
I’d like to say that I have loved Hayden since 2001 lol I enjoyed his performance as A.S.. I’m really happy to see him getting the love he’s always deserved.
Finally hayden deserve this.
doesn’t feel real that i’m seeing these two perform together again. this is going to be epic
May there be a Vader spin off with Hayden before there is a Reva spin off.
Super glad Hayden is back for this I wouldn’t have watched it without him!!
Sequels to the prequels! Much needed!
Awesome to see the actors behind my favourite childhood characters get their due respect! Also, is it just me, or does Hayden sound more like Matt these days?
So awesome seeing those two together again.
9:40
CARBONI S FAKE LAUJGH MADE ME UNSUBSCRIBE TO THE STAR WARS YOUTUB CHANNEL
It's beyond great to have Hayden and Ewan back as Anakin/Vader and Obi-Wan when I first heard of Kenobi I was wondering if it would be animated but so glad it's live action and they got the OG actors back for it. I feel like we need a Darth Vader show as well with him hunting down the last of the Jedi he can find like in the Vader Comics.
LEGENDS
2:37 that spin tho
After a while, the crowd is obnoxious.  I don't want to keep them shouting; I want to hear the actors talking.
9:40
annoying crowd
Words cannot describe how happy I am. I'm just completely elated that these two are back together and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, that they know how much we love them, despite whatever people said about the prequels. You two shaped my childhood as much as Luke Skywalker/Mark Hamill did. Starwars was my childhood and you two deserve all the best!
Another missed opportunity for Ewan to start with "Hello there." 😔
This just had me smiling from ear to ear throughout! Loved seeing all the love and positivity given to them by the fans now that they couldn't get years ago, especially Hayden. When the crowd started chanting his name, that was so nice! "This is where the fun begins!" What a legend!!!
So happy to see them sitting together enjoying the moment! Pretty cool how both their outfits reflect their characters' outfits from the trilogy: Ewan with the white & brown and Hayden with the full black outfit!
This is so awesome!!! 😭💗
Hayden’s last words, go hard
I think Hayden was actually tearing up.  What a sweet guy
I was half expecting the announcer to offer Christianson's sear with the words, "Take a seat, young Skywalker." Lmaoo
the crowd really needed to shut up, I'm glad they're excited but Hayden and Ewan couldn't get a word out without being interrupted
Who is Obi Wan Kenobi without Anakin Skywalker aka Darth Vader I❤Star Wars
the audience is sooo annoying
I get emotional seeing all the love Hayden is getting now, after being hated in the past. I’ve always been a big fan of him, and I’m glad he’s getting all the love
Wow, he sounds almost exactly like his Clone Wars iteration, his voice has definitely deepened in the past two decades
Just a reminder that in 2015, Disney wanted us to forget that the prequels existed.
This is great!
Hayden's quote at the end was epic! The cultural impact and the memes are so dank thanks to them and the teams at Lucasfilms!
At last the REAL Darth Vader is back.
So, everybody hated Hayden even called him "the worst actor for playing Vader" and most Star Wars fans ended up calling him all kind of things, and now everybody would have bended at one word from him.
2:38 everyone noticed the guy at the back? He got the skill! Lol
Dumb weebs in the background
I was hoping when Ewan McGregor walked out he would say….. “hello there”
Soak in the love, fellas, you desserve it
They should make a live action clone wars series
Hey! HEY! Play the force theme when obi wan uses the force!
LOVE them!!!!!!!!❤️💕💖🥰
This host needs to calm the hell down.
9:30
Hayden seems a decent fella
I will NEVER accept ANYONE else as Anakin Skywalker!!!! Hayden IS Anakin Skywalker!!!! Can't wait to watch the first 2 episodes today!!!!
Ewan is wearing brown and Hayden is wearing black. The branding is strong with them.
Hayden: 'This is where the fun begins.' r/PrequelMemes: Hayden is with us!
how havent they aged?
This interview would have been 3 minutes long if not for the fans who kept insisting on shouting out.
Ewan always got love from people. Some prequels haters would still admit "Ewans performance was the best thing in this trilogy" But Hayden was done dirty by critics so its great seeing the love he's getting now
90's kids love you Hayden, always remember that.
Darth Vader was at his best in Rebels!
Ewan looks at crowd Crowd: "AAAAAASKDBFJEEKSJAJAAAAAAA"
It’s so good to see them finally get the love they deserve
There’s definitely a clear vision with the prequels. The dialogue may have been cheesy, and downright bad sometimes, but the overall story is interesting.  The sequels, however, have literally no redeeming qualities going for it.
Ok the thumbnail Hayden looks like palpitatine
They finally got the love they deserve
Péssimo! Me decepcionei com os 2 primeiros capítulos.
Bruh I could cry watching this
Hopefully Hayden gets a good script and direction this time around. People crapped all over his acting in the prequels but his acting abilities weren't the problem.
It’s great seeing them together again.
This just shows that, even hating spoiled kids grow up and learn to hate a little less, a little more quiet. It is the same amount of people loving episode 1,2 and 3 now as it was back then. It´s just not that many haters that feel they have to scream out as loud anymore. You still have the same problem with Solo and episode 8 and 9, eventually the haters will calm down and turns out the movies weren't that awe full after all. No, the movies are far from masterpieces. They will still be full of flaws. But we will all see that it was not that big of a deal. There are more important things in the world. And one they we will scream for Ridley, Boyega, Isaac and Tran to come back.
Episode 2 is my favorite film
As a former animator on Clone Wars I am super thankful for Hayden's words about the series :)
What a rude crowd thoguh forreal
9:40   HE SAID IT HE SAID IT...!!!
Evan just wanted the crowd to shut up and let him talk.😂
Ewan: brown coat with white tight pants  Hayden: all black ensemble and longer shaggy hair pushed back 🤔 Sounds familiar
This was really delightful.
anyone else kinda annoyed that the crowd was too involved in the interview?
SORRY DID NO ONE SEE THE DUDE AT 2:36 IN THE BACK CASUALLY AND MASTERFULLY TWIRL HIS SABRE??
everything after George Lucas is fan fiction
You know, right from the first time I heard Anakin say "I hate sand, it's rough coarse and irritating, and it gets everywhere", I actually loved those lines because I related to it 100%, not being a huge fan of going to the beach, largely in part with trying to get rid of all the sand that sticks to your body and gets in to all your stuff.
Notice that Ewan was wearing the colors of Jedi robes and Hayden was in all black!  They really thought this out.
Hayden deserves that. He has never been a bad acto. Maybe this means a comeback for him.
he said da thinggg
Go watch the first 2 episodes! They're just incredible
I like how people love Star Wars but theres a point it gets really ridiculous 😂
I always liked the prequels. I remember buying episode 1 on vhs. I was 14
Hayden did a fabulous job as Anakin!
I like how Ewan has matched his clothes to Obi-Wan and Hayden to Darth Vader
Gotta say, digging the Jedi/Sith color schemes of the wardrobes.
Legends
WOW! So awesome to see them together and get the love/support they desire! 9:35... best moment!!!
God, this is just the most wholesome thing I've ever seen in my life.
❤❤❤❤❤
Watched Obi-Wan Kenobi last night, 🤔🤔🤔 Is this show before or after Rebels?
Guys, love to point this out Gina Carano did nothing wrong.  Star Wars stop being Star Wars way before she was fired.  I am glad people like this show but the bait and switch needs to end.
Ewan and Hayden deserve all the love they get. They didn't deserve all the criticism from the prequels. Long live Kenobi and Anakin!
this is wholesome!
He better do Justice to the Anakin from Clone Wars. I'm under 35 but I didnt conveniently forget like others!  He has to be Better. There was a VADER before him and he needs to respect that as well.   Forgive, don't Forget!
i love how they are wearing the same colors as their outfits in the movies <3
I loooove Hayden's mullet
I love how they're wearing their characters' colors!
*Hello there*
Hayden sounds like Matt Lanter's Anakin now. We've come full circle
Loving the love that’s being poured out for Hayden and Ewan!!!
WE HYPE BOYS AND GIRLS, WE HYPE! FINNA WATCH THE FIRST EPISODE TONIGHT WITH MY BABY GIRL WOOOOOOOOO
Anthony Carboni has the best job interviewing this lot.
Color coordinating with their on-screen counterparts for the win
5:34 Random person : THEY'RE LIKE BROTHERS!  Hayden : Yes... Yes, we are.  Seriously, they ARE brothers. Their relationship are priceless.
first two episodes where boring as hell
Ok people need to stop interrupting during interviews. Good lord. Let them Finnish their sentences.
I wish the sequels were undone. This is Star Wars!
Is it just me or does Hayden sound more like Anakin than he did in the prequels? Even though he was amazing as anakin, he sounds like anakin from the clone wars
Look at the guy with the red lightsaber at 2:37
Where was this level of support for Hayden 15 years ago?
Dreams can come true
It’s absolutely beautiful to see Hayden get the love he deserves
Not been 20 years since ROTS was released, can't this man do math lol And thought they did reshoots in Jan of 2005 as well.
My God, it's good to see these two getting the applause they deserve, but jesus let the guys speak.
Hello there!
DAM ITS SO HARD TO LISTEN TO THIS GUY INTERVIEWING THESE TWO GREAT ACTORS
They haven't aged a bit. Wow
Loved how they're choice of wardrobe reflects the characters they play. Wondering if it was deliberate...
imagine Ewan starts by saying "Hello there!"
9:40
I grew up lovinggggg the prequel movies so this new series makes my childhood heart SO happy!
Epicness cant wait to see anakin then see vader !
HE SAID IT! HAYDEN YOU'RE A LEGEND!
Man is that all the extras you can get? I always wondered how the actors can act like those people are real fans and some maybe but this is staged, oh what if they didnt tell Ewan and Hayden, nah they arent that clever.... lol EDIT: 0:44 there is no one back there you see and half the place is empty and then 1:58 same then 2:06 they appear out of thin air and fill the place, did they CGI a crowd???
9:40 this is where funs begins
i love how hayden is like the dad of ewan now
Hayden now after years sounds exactly like Anakin from Clone Wars.
I still don't understand how Ewan didn't say "Hello there"
Good to see my childhood actors are back 🥺 it's been a long time Ewan and Hayden ❤️
This is what I’ve wanted to see for ages let’s hope it doesn’t disappoint
Has anyone noticed that this is a friendly and enthusiastic cult?
I never get it why was Hayden hated ?
Hayden and Ewan are the best. Amazing to see them back together again! The first 2 episodes were great guys!
I'm here to listen to the actors.  Not the goober that is constantly playing with the crowd.  ALL that he should do is ask interesting questions and let the actors talk.  People doing interviews should not try to make themselves the star of the show.
Bro this crowd
Yes, the "this is where the fun begins" part was epic, but I loved "I missed you guys too". It melted my heart. You guys deserve all this and more ♥️
Idk how i feel about it some scenes i thought i wasn't watching star wars They could of did more on order 66 scenes fights ect. anything longer instead we get kids than leia's story.....  no lightsaber fights some characters didn't fit in i give it 6/10
in 20 years the the cast of the new trilogy will have this same treatment
The prequels were the star wars I grew up with so this hits me In the feels! 😭❤️
Love them soo muchhh
It's nice to see ppl show Hayden love. He deserves it.
Gave me chills seeing those two together again. Let’s hope we get a Vader backstory or spin-off as well.
Absolute goosebumps when they walk in!
I thought Hayden in Revenge of the Sith was great, sure there was some dodgy dialogue etc but that wasn't his fault.  Great to see these guys back.
I was 8 in 02 saw attack of the clones in theaters with my family then again on 05 I’m so happy I have goosebumps seeing them together love you guys u raised me
Hayden looks like if Paul Walker and Andrew Garfield had a love child
So so happy to see them together. I always thought the hatred the prequels got were completely unnecessary, I'm so grateful Hayden and Ewan still wants to return for their roles. We have waited so long for this and now it's finally happening!!
Hayden at 4:30 used the force to quiet the crowd down, I love him
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I already watched both first episodes that's came out and ohhhhh boy, i can't remember when i got that many chills. Absolutely fantastic to see obi wan again , i grew up with prequels and am so happy that people started to realize how good of the movies those are, and am so glad that they gave those amazing actors another chance that they so much deserved. Again am so happy can't wait to see more episodes
Anyone notice how Hayden's voice has become more like that of Matt Lanter's?
Imagine if a vindictive, Misogynist, pig like Harvey Weinstein got the rights to Harry Potter. Then he changed the story to say that the ministry of magic only allows men to practice magic. Because in his words; "Magic is Masculine"   That's exactly what KK di with Star Wars. Anyone supporting her tirades are akin to the North Korean soldiers that propagate their eternal leader.
Legit these two have not aged in 20 years.
Hayden figured out how you get Star Wars fans on his side. Be a fan of Clone Wars and quote a line from the movies.
I never understood all the Hayden hate. I thought he knocked a homerun playing Anakin. But then again we are talking about SW fans. Some of them are the biggest cry babies in the known universe.  🙄
SO excited to start watching the series! The energy after Hayden’s last comment was *visceral* I always loved those movies because of those 2 guys, their positivity, down to earth, humour, I adore them both, you can see the depth when they talk, those are not superficial people, they clearly have a lot of good to give and are perfect for the roles, outstanding actors! definitely deserve all the love and success!
0:47 The Gods have arrived
The cheering man!!! Much deserved
The ❤️ was 👌
La prélogie la meilleure ❤❤❤
I'm really happy for Hayden honestly! I hope the series turns out awesome and he gets more roles after :)
Nobody has even seen the show. They're cheering for something that they don't even know is good or bad. Kind of a weird thought.
Sick trick by the guy in the back at 2:36
This 9:40 is where the fun begins
Gosh I love these guys 💖
Hayden Christensen worst actor EVER to paly Darth Vader!!!
This host is terrible. We heard nothing from both of them. Crowd don’t shut up. I lot of wasted time.
People said the prequels sucked when they came out, at least they didn't destroy the plot like the new disney Saga did. Plus most famous starwars meme templates exist in the prequel trilogy
Hayden and Ewan did a hell of a job in the prequels. So glad that they're able to get their just deserved respect for their roles in the franchise. As a GenX fan who was already grown up watching the prequels, I loved their work in the movies and every cheer is deserved.
love them !
I don't know when I first saw Star Wars but I grew up with it & basically my favourite Christmas gift ever was when I got Episode I-VI on DVD in 2006/at age 6 💙 My favourite characters were/are Anakin & Qui-Gon & I've always considered everything leading up to Vader as so freaking tragic 😭🔥 It's my favourite story & never left me over all these years :') So my feels are just all over the place from having just watched the first two episodes of Obi-Wan Kenobi 😭😭😭 Thank you & may the Force be with you all 🔥💕
I am so happy they Hayden is finally receiving the love he has deserved after all these years
This is where the fun begins!!!!!!!!!
That explosion of cheer after "This is where the fun begins" must be one of the highlights for everyone in that room during this second prequel era. They are so lucky to see the GOATs Master Obi Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin freaking Skywalker together in person. Love it when they say iconic lines ahaha
9:27 Get after it Hayden!
That was awesome!!
Now that is the right theme to enter the stage!
Hayden is an absolute unit.  Legend (and Master) status achieved!
I can't wait for kids growing up with the sequels to share their love for Daisy, Oscar and John just like Ewan and Hayden! Such an amazing and surreal time to be a Star Wars fan! :)
Justin Herbert looks good up there with Obi-Wan
I’m so happy to see these two alongside each other again.
im crying tears of joy seeing Hayden being so loved finally🥹🥹 so emotional he deserves this so much im so happy
What the hell is that host wearing ????
i'm so happy for them to be back
Hayden the most beautiful thing on earth 💝💝💝
Hayden Christensen was the victim on massive bullying brought on my modern Cancel Culture. I’m glad he’s getting the career he deserves.
all those lady screams came from men 😂
Americans cheer when a celebrity literally just breathes I swear, just let the actors talk I bet they find it annoying having to constantly pause!
The audience was great, that host or interviewer is so annoying
"my powers have doubled since the last time we met count". 😁
I know that's the shill crowd Lucasfilm and Disney has been pandering to but those 2 guys deserve every praise they can get. If the people of Lucasfilm has a tiny bit of common sense the next project would be a Vader series that's central conflict would be Anakin's inner struggle while hunting those pesky Jedi. I mean this would be a straight up cash cow one Disney desperately need.
2:37 random dude showing off in the background
Did you see that guy in the background at 2:38 flipping his lightsaber 😂 saw his chance and took it.
I just wanna thank these two so much for being my childhood Star Wars.
seeing them both exit with an arm around each other cooks up some feels.
I appreciate the interview but it feels so annoying hearing the fans scream every 1 minute.  I want to hear the actors. Not you!
These two legends deserve all the love in the world. The guy in 6:37 is what I would say to Ewan if I see him hopefully. The end where Hayden says "This is where the fun begins" had me fanboying the past 10 minutes lmao. This whole video has the stan in me hyped up and cheering from my bedroom. Cannot wait to watch Obi Wan Kenobi!!!
These poor guys have to deal with all these knuckleheads.
9:39 That sounds a lot deeper
Ewan mcgregor so should have opened just with ‘hello there’
I love love love the clothing choices here.  Hayden in black with black boots and Ewan in browns and whites.  Very symbolic.  Amazing!  <3  Great audience too!
I'll never forgive ewan for not opening with "hello there"
Anyone else realize they're wearing their colors
Dude, I missed this in the actual stream because it was pretty late in the UK. But I’m sooo happy to see them together again!
Look how happy Hayden is 💕💕💕💕💕
I'm almost scared to get my hopes up but I'm so ready for this!
Hayden is such a humble guy! Deserves a restart in his career and i wish that OBI-series is the one.  Ewan; the perfect young Alec G. He is impeccable
hayden still looks so youthful
Iam so xcited For Darth Hayden.
Hayden knows about the memes and embraces them. What a guy. Always thought he was cool.
Can someone edit this host out of the video? 😰
The Irony is that we never going to see Hayden in the show but Darth Vader. Imagine if hi only show up in the last episode or as a hologram.
They're kind of wearing their clone wars colors
These 2 were my childhood, it's so cool to see them come back together.
This is by far the most excited I've been for Star Wars in a looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong time. 🙏
9:40  *instant chills* so glad haydens back!
I promise when they walked out together I wasn’t crying you were 😂🥹😭😭
Hayden is the purest soul ive ever known
Hayden Christensen acted PERFECTLY in the prequels IMO, my excitement levels are through the roof
You can see nervousness on both of their faces cuz they're not used to it
Where did they getvthis announcer from ...what a tool.
Chuuta el presidenten Boric?! Weeena
Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!😍😍😍😍😍
This made me tear up
At this point, the 2 of them ARE Star Wars, nothing else
It is heartwarming to see how Hayden is getting all the love he received as soon as he entered the room, it really makes me happy to see him being able to enjoy the fandom that grew up with his movies and the legacy he left behind as AnaKING Skywalker.
OK
"This is where the fun begins" indeed!
I'm very happy Hayden got to come back and make the series. Even though his performances got so much criticism, he (to me) IS Anakin Skywalker. I think people forget that a performance is also down to the director. And let's face it, actors aren't robots, they can't switch on the greatest performance ever, especially considering how young he was. They're human beings. Nice to see him get another chance and can't wait to see the show! Loved seeing the reception he got. I'm sure the backlash was painful and fairly unnecessary.
Where they get this guy?
HE SAID THE THING, HE SAID THE THIIIIIIIIIIING
They. Would. Not. Stop. Cheering.
this series is so good mannn the first 2 episodes were really good!
Awesome.
Heyyyy! Perú 🇵🇪🇵🇪 ama Star wars!!
We need more appearances of Darth Vader in other series' too, now that Hayden is back. Anakin/Vader _is_  star wars, and Hayden _is_ Anakin.
Unpopular opinion, but I think Hayden Christensen was awesome in the prequels.  It made people uncomfortable because he was playing an immature young adult with immense power.  I think he did it perfectly.
May the 4th be with you fellas and Friends happy Obi-Wan day
I'm so happy to see Hayden back. Always loved him so I'm glad to see him so happy.
Prequels are still the best Star Wars. Attack of the Clones and especially Revenge of the Sith is peak Star Wars. LOVED the first two episodes of Kenobi this morning. The world wants dark Star Wars. Tragedy. Happy endings are awesome, but tragic endings are the balance we need, just like the force
Got chills when Hayden said This is where the fun begins. Can’t wait to finish work and watch. Woop woop
Is it just me or does it seem like this is just a paycheck for everyone?
Iconic
I’m so happy to see Hayden and Ewan together again, not to mention the fanfare behind Hayden I was a middle schooler during the Prequel trilogy and was so disappointed in toxicity surrounding Anakin, but now not only is he getting the applause he deserved, it seems both of them are coming back for the love of the characters and fans! Protect Hayden and Ewan they may be our only hope!!!
I LOVED THIS INTERVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHOLESOME AF
he said it. he said the thing.
9:40 🥲 Nostalgia
"You were my brother" lolzz
3:57 bro, this little premiere is so unprepared, couldn't even get the name right lmaoo
Reliving great things of the past in the present
This has giving me the same feeling when Tobey Maguire came back to Spider-Man as an adult!  This gives me 1000x more times of the nostalgia effect!  Ahh life is completed!! 🤩
Hayden is about the same age now as Darth Vader was in Ep. IV
OMG they walked out with their arms around each other
This is where the fun begins - mic drop ❤
I love how the table looks like Beskar
Just watched the first two episodes absolutely awesome!
IT HAS BEGAN!!!!!!
Could anyone make out what the fans yelled a few times that made them laugh?
why Anthony Carbonite directly referencing "AOTC'' instead of "ROTS"?
Oh my god!!! I love this!!! So happy to see them together again!!!! Two legends!!!! I want to go to a celebration so bad. Hopefully it comes to the east coast some time!
Their outfit color scheme is on point, they knew what they were doing with that. It just looks like Anakin and Obi-Wan trading Jedi robes for fancy clothes. The cherry on top would've been Ewan's first words on stage being "Hello there!"
Iv always loved the films, I like Haydens acting. Dude is awesome.
Dude I’m just excited as everyone else but after they get on stage the crowd needs to shut the hell up lol
Gimme Ewan and Hayden on Hot Ones. Dew itt
I love how ewan is wearing brown like Jedi robes and Hayden is wearing black like anakin
Wow the audience reaction
My entire childhood just came back!!! I need to cry
This made me soo happy. Smiled the whole time. Saw it yesterday already
I haven't seen Hayden since Episode 3!!! THIS GUY FINALLY SHOWS HIMSELF JUST LIKE TOBEY MAGUIRE
Wait- is that a beskar table?! 😂
I can't express how happy I am right now. This brings me an incomprehensible joy to see these two sat here together after 17 years; it feels so unbelievably special. These guys are a staple of my life.
Ewan just looks so much like Obi Wan from episode 4 - like perfect casting. In Episode 1 I could not make such a visual connection but now it just seems perfect.
I can't express how happy I am right now. This brings me an incomprehensible joy to see these two sat here together after 17 years; it feels so unbelievably special. These guys are a staple of my life. They literally raised me.
Thinking of them as Vader and Obi-wan, I never realized how much deeper and smoother Hayden’s voice naturally is compared to the bright liveliness of Ewan’s. Unexpected and interestingly fortunate roll casting. Just a splendid revelation.
Im just here for Carboni :)
I love how Hayden wore all black like Anakin and Ewan wore brown and white like Obiwan, nice touch!
So Great. The new show is peak Star Wars. So good!!!
Just watched the first 2 episodes. Loved it so far.
“this is where the fun begins” what a legend. the audience reaction is what makes me happy to be a star wars fan
Coming here to a time before we realised the show isn’t about either of these 2.
These people achieved NOTHING.  Why are they so famous?!?
That was awesome!
Great people, great actors, bad Disney
9:40 Free Hype Button.
Lord Vader 😈🥷🏽
We love you Hayden! We love you Ewan!
Ewan McGregor looks as young as Paul Rudd😮
These two guys are like John Lennon and Paul McCartney at the height of Beatlemania with how the fans are reacting!
Weird how this is 17 years in the making and I was more excited to see Carboni there than them 2 😂😂
Everybody talking about Ewan and Hayden but can we talk about Jake Lloyd?
theyre so iconic, best star wars duo idc
Would've been great if Ewan would've said his iconic line of "Hello There" in the beginning lol.
It's so cool to see them back and in the best way possible so great man 👏😁
I still haven’t watched the Star Wars movies, but for good reason! I just got into the Star Wars scene and made an agreement with my Star Wars obsessed friend that we would watch the movies, in timeline order, together with our friend group, so my first time experiencing the movies will be with friends. Core memory achieved!
Out of curiosity was there really hatred for the Actor? I pretty much hate the character because of poor dialogue like "I hate Sand" or "No, it's because I'm more in love with you."
obikin IS BACK YALL
not me crying while watching this
this interview really had some adam and jamie vibes
the perfect duel: darth vader vs gaara...
That intro was great
there are 8 years left in canon until A New Hope. That means we can get 8 seasons, just saying.
Hayden getting that Andrew Garfield redemption arc
I love these guys for making my childhood so special. And now my adulthood gets to be badass too!
They matched there outfits to the charictures. Litterally teared up on " This is where the fun begins"
9:40 you’re welcome
Like we should as an audience want Christian and Ewen to talk as much as possible. Kinda crazy how much the audience continued to Interrupt both Ewen and especially Christian.
Be my apprentice learn to use the dark side of the force  goooooooood 😈🥷🏽
Ewan & Hayden invented bromance.
I love how the comment sections are vastly different from what they were this past week. Far less negativity. Hmm, I have a few thoughts about why..  1) Either the angry fanboys truly did not watch the show, as they claimed they wouldn't. Therefore, have nothing to say. Which, we know very well is not the case... because they actually need to watch the show in order to prove themselves right. Which is what they want.  2) They DID watch.. and they actually enjoyed it.  (this one I like)  OR  3) They fell for a FAKE LEAK suggesting Reva ( a diverse woman) was hijacking the Kenobi show. Only to realize that Obi Wan, Reva and Leia are equally matched for screen time. Which means, they can't use the argument that Reva is stealing the show. And if they try, then the same argument MUST apply to Leia. And we know they can't do THAT because it would then contradict their other arguments of only wanting the OT Legends. Which, Leia very much is.   Meaning, that if they DO try to make the same argument against BOTH Reva AND Leia, then they're proving that they just do not want women in Star Wars. Even further, if they don't make any argument against Leia, then that means, they just don't want diverse women in Star Wars.  So, any way you look at it... they no longer have an argument.  Hmmm 🤔 it's "almost" as if Disney were the ones to put out the Fake Leak in order to set them up.  Trolling the TROLLS.  HOW FANTASTICALLY BRILLIANT!!!!! Now THIS, is what I call, a proper "bait and switch" 💯🧔🤌🥳
bad set design..the seats shouldnt be out there with backs to the crowd ...cool otherwise.
Bleh, Mannequin Skywalker...
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Hayden entrance should have the 501st legion clones and with the Jedi temple march song
I remember years and years ago someone said Hayden would never return as Darth Vader.  But as we know, only the sith deal in absolutes
You can't looks at this and tell me that people hate the prequels. Star wars fans are star wars fans, not prequel, sequel, or original fans.  It's such a beautiful thing to see my most favorite and iconic childhood actors together again.
What if Hayden plays a role in the MCU next? LMAO
3:25 "At last we'll reveal ourselves to the public..."
May the force be with us all!!
Jeez, so many boring questions. Do these interviewers all go to some club or class on how to ask the most pointless questions?
How can you not just love and admire Hayden?  I'm a man and got teary eyed as he got to experience what the fans really feel about him.  I'm glad he came to the show, and I'm glad he felt the very warm reception.  Props to all involved!
Was about 20 when the prequels came out. Only one I disliked was Attack of the Clones. I really hope they do this well and we maybe get another series or two from it. Vader should probably get his own show at some point, it could easily cross over with another series ie the Mando and Fett crossovers.
Good for Hayden always felt like he took to much flak for following hid Director vision. Nice to see him get some fan love
When the fan said: You are Brothers! Than Hayden said: Yes, we are. Tears welled up in my eyes... <3
He did the thing, HE DID THE THING
Hayden just had to wait for his fan base to grow up. Now they have and he’s beloved by a generation.
The prequels were amazing, yes they were political, but I think it's good we got to see the political side of the Republic being reformed into the Empire. Look at Episode 7, 8 and 9. Those don't really gel well with each other. Each one is a singular piece, and you can see the ideas that were being yo-yoed between the movies. Not memorable at all. It took Disney all that time to bring Palpatine back to realise this is what we wanted. But even they screwed him up. Hopefully they stay true to Lucas' original work with more of these series. Hopefully we get a Darth Vader series with Hayden.
This is where the fun begins made my freaking night!
Such handsome young men ❤️
THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS
Bro the crowd needs to shut up seriously, let them speak and stop heckling!
I wonder what Hayden thinks of his relationship with Ahsoka.
Ewan and Hayden: Says one word Everyone: AAARGH!
HE SAID THE THING!!!
Bro this crowd needs to shut up lmao
I'm sobbing watching them.  It's so freaking good to have them back I can't
Hey how dare he talk shut about the Jedi robes.  I wear those everywhere they are awesome
HE SAID THE THING
About time Hayden got some recognition What a pair of amazing actors
Just watched the show... Truly amazing
Awesome!
9:40
* Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen take a seat
These are amazing actors. It is such a waste to have them in this bait and switch of a show, we want George Lucas star wars not the horrible stories disney has been putting forward #firekathleenkennedy
Its so great that the prequels get the love they deserve. On a sidenote, I think the Host is doing a great job.
Awesome
Bro should have come out and said hello there
I can't believe how young they both look.
This is where the fun begins
A lot of people hated Hayden, but he made Anakin Skywalker my favourite character.
Childhood Heroes!!! <3
Hope the series is as good as the hype... :
I LOVE YOU HAYDEN
So Haydon just had the best interview ending ever
On a serious note people should give some love to jake loyd as well. The kid suffered so much hate he never mentally recovered and his story is so sad. He was simply a kid playing a kid, what did people expect? Him to act like Darth Vader already?
Hayden was a good Anikan, it was Georges Dialogue and Direction that was the problem.
He said the line!!!
Did we all forget the response and reviews to the prequel trilogy? It's like if Jar Jar Binks got a show and everyone started fainting in happiness....
these two are still the same age
does the audience have to scream at everything?
Hayden is Anakin Skywalker the father of Mark Hamill, Luke Skywalker.
Yessss
Hayden Christensen is wearing all black. He is consumed by the dark side.
This is sooo awesome to see I was smiling away wish I was there but seeing this still makes me happy and cannot wait to see Obi-Wan Today. Starwar fan since I was a kid and still Big Kid At Heart. ❤💙🖤
Hayden and Ewan is the best actor duo ever
Just a lot of screaming for the sake of it...
What did the person from the crowd yell at 8:50?
Hayden has come back and the fan base love him
Have they even aged? It has been 20 years lmao
I love that they played Duel of the Fates as they entered and leave the stage, it's so cool!
They must feel so weird.. it's just strange the reaction for this story
i need that table
Gotta love that their outfits here resembled their characters
I love how they're dressed in their characters colours. Hayden wearing black and Ewan wearing the white and brown.
seeing the crowd show so much appreciation for hayden makes me so happy
HE SAID THE WORDS!!!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Ewan: "Nice seeing you again Anakin"  Hayden: "You too"
my fav part of the whole show , didn't expect Hayden saying that , but was perfect , Ewan and Hayden do a great team
Those two aged like fine wine
are we just gonna ignore that mans sick trick in the background at 2:37 ??!
2:36. the guy in the background 👌 EDIT: Grammar
Honestly, this all feels like a fever dream. I can't believe this is real. So good to see Hayden and Ewan back and looking better than ever. I cannot wait to get stuck into Kenobi.
Should've worn the dark robes and jedi costume to the show
After 17/18 years, not 20
9:39 Thank me later :D
Hayden Christensen is Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader. People that hated him should've moved on and accepted him, but it takes Disney taking over to realize how good he actually was in the movies. I've always been a fan of him in his role in Star Wars and the way George Lucas portrayed him was exactly the best we can get.
I couldn't be more happy to see Hayden embracing the star wars role he played. It must have been so hard for him for so many years but now he has the chance at the character and have a chance to embrace the love of the community. I'm so happy for him.
3:56  Obi-Wan Kenobi???
this put a massive smile on my face
*this is where the fun begins*
There's a time for love and applause, of course, but people have got to give them a little time, at least, to answer questions or say something!  People interrupting, they gotta get _their_  voices heard, it's extremely disrespectful.
These two are the heart and soul of Star Wars! Huge kudos to George Lucas for casting so talented actors!
these guys are vampires  barely aged a bit after 20 years
This host is horrible
I love how the colors of their attire resembles their Jedi clothing in the prequels.
This just so fantastic.... Anyone else pick up on the fact that Ewan and Hayden are actually wearing their respective Jedi and Sith coloured clothing 😊
I really love them <3
it's perfect that giant glowsticks are part of Star Wars cosplay <3
If Hayden said the line now where is my  ”Hello there” by Ewan 😤
This was just amazing. Everything came flooding back.  👏
Epic ❤️
I love when they first walk on the stage and sit down how you can see they try so hard to keep a straight face and then ewan just burst out laughing
Moving to see these to guys together again! I love ep 1-3.
9:38 SAY THE LINE BART
They look so good!!! So handsome!!
Good to see them happy. Really hope it all works out.
Hayden is turning into a young Meg Gibson haha
They are totally wearing their Jedi robe colors
now if only could applaud the younger anakin actor
Just seeing them together is giving me goosebumps.
they are so kind <3
This literally makes me feel like a child again. It’s so good to see Hayden get love. He played Anakin the way he was directed. And who doesn’t like Ewan!? Nostalgia
Seeing them again...I'm legitimately crying right now, these are my childhood hero's & to a lot of others around the world. I'm glad they're getting the recognition & love they deserve after so long. True Star Wars fans never hated these two!
Hayden looking young again!!! So glad they are getting the reception today that they deserved for so long!!
Very happy to see McGregor and Christensen again, but I have to say that the audience there was quite annoying. These actors were there to answer and discuss the show. Not listening to screaming chickens all the time. Please, just be quiet and listen.
Hayden is my canadian brother being from Vancouver as well
Ewan should have opened with a “Hello there” that would have made people go nuts
The crowd needs to chill just a little I wanna hear the actors talk
I'm in My 30s and it's taking me back to watching the prequels in my kid years.....love the upcoming prpjects
The host hasn't seen Revenge of the Sith? Hayden: I find your lack of knowledge disturbing.  Nah for real how does he interview THEM without seeing the movie in which they DUEL (magnificently might I add,props to them both for going thorugh so much practice!)
I watched both episodes tonight. I missed them both. Lol. They both make me smile and happy. And we are the adults now. We were the kids!
man Ewan at 3:35 pretty much in tears talking about being back just makes me so happy he gets to experience the love this time around, unlike what people treated the prequels
Wish the crowd would let them speak, its exciting, we get it.
Bruh most of this clip is just screaming😂
5:35 Obi wan remember how he let him burn in lava
It must feel great to Hayden to go from critics bashing his acting and the prequels, to being a fan favorite. This proves that critics are full of sh*t.
Ewan wearing brown and white while Hayden wears all black — boy I sure wonder what that’s referencing!
If you guys did not notice. Ewan was wearing the traditional Jedi robe colors, while Hayden was wearing his signature black clothes. Who ever came up with this is an absolute genius!!!!!
Most of the toxic masculinity in that crowd were probably responsible for the horrific abuse aimed at Christensen.  Hypocritical SW fans.
Seeing hayden back in star wars where he belongs just makes me so happy
so many retards cant just shut up and let them talk
Dude in the back 2:37 flexing
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Fed up of seeing Ewan on tv doing dodgy adverts and begging for peoples money
Hayden is a legend
oh god they're back!!! excited!!!!!!!
Great job everybody here showing appreciation for Hayden, this guy got so much unwarranted hate from incels in the early 2000's.
Seeing these two together and how fans react seeing them is just mindblowing. Kathleen Kennedy and few others never understood what fans really want and what makes Star wars, even with the critism of the prequels people love these two. Obi-wan and Anakin are reason SW exist and these two where there making it happen.  ( Kennedy is the producer of the series but thank god George Lucas is back and maybe she finally listens).
9:39 Anakin Skywalker - " This is where the fun begins"
۞اللهم صل على سيدنا محمد وعلى آل سيدنا محمد۞ 3× Subhanallah 3× Alhamdulillah 3× Allahu Akbar 3× Subhaanallahi
if only he didn’t turn to the dark side
This whole thing just warmed my heart, especially after how Ahmed Best (Jar-Jar) told his story of how he almost took his own life over all the hate and Hayden nearly gave up on acting.
헤이든이 this is where the fun begins 대사 지를때 부랄찢고 울부짖으면서 공중제비 504바퀴 돌았다
I like how they're wearing their character's colors.
Must be so nerve racking hayden is sweating through his suits armpit. Love them both
Imagine that the interviewer had some questions these two hadn't been asked a million times in the last few weeks.
Me personally I would have loved to have asked Hayden which Animated Series did He enjoy more 1. The Clone Wars or 2. Rebel’s???  I think He would have picked BOTH. The Clone Wars because of His character taking on a Padawan Ashoka Tano (Snips).  To learn that Anakin could have that type of relationship and be a Teacher and a great Teacher at that.  And Rebels because of the continuing storyline of Ashoka and Her search for the truth about Her Master.  And I think He would have loved Rebels because the animation was more life like.
Did the interviewer seriously just call Ewan McGregor "buddy"? Wow
❤️❤️❤️❤️ SO happy for Hayden and Ewan. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
What is the guy shouting at 5:37?
He said the thing... HE SAID THE THING!
MARK HAMILL EWAN MCGREGOR HAYDEN CHRISTENSEN. THE HEART OF STAR WARS
And give a HUGE hand to Sir John Williams (Yep, he’s knighted in my book lol) for that amazing composition - Duel of the Fates. It instantly made their entrance both mesmerizing and nostalgic….. I cannot wait‼️ 💯
Remember guys sequel trilogy is not canon
Episode 3 was the first SW movie I have watched and these two actors did such a phenomenal job they basically made me a fan for life.
I am just so happy to see the fans show that love for them and how Hayden embraces the community & ewan goading the audience to cheer again. xd May the Force be with you all!
How much has this been hyped up, it never ends, its not a movie? Looking forward to it though 😄
Hayden is a guy I wish all actors would be like when taking on preexisting characters in these universes he took the time to learn them and play them with respect to the stories that we want instead of ignoring it and doing their own thing he actually went and watched the clone wars and possibly made his anakin even better than before
It's over. They both have the high ground.
My absolute favourite sound track off all time that Star Wars theme is iconic for light saber fighting and any time Vader goes into super Sayin mode I love it man so happy Hayden is back I really hope they make a Vader series when he’s in his prime please give that to me before I die Disney
Those last words. 🙌
Hayden finally getting the respect and praise he deserves makes me so happy!
Ahh we needed this guys!
4:29 was That Vegeta's hand on the crowd behind Ewan ??
Lets hope Haydens actually learnt to act these days
They've been  immortalized like Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford.
I love how they make them wore the outfit with the same colour of their jedi robe
Lets hope this series will finaly be a return of good life action star wars. You can only rewatch clone wars so many times. from this point on, lets all just forget the sequal mess
A Crowd cheers
Man that’s awesome when he said the line “this is where the fun begins” the hype man, also one of my favorite quotes.  You can feel the excitement from the crowd as if your part of it as a Star Wars fan.
They should of got Hayden back for the last 3 Starwars films
Thank you god and Disney to bring this awsome people agian for us! Can't wait to see Obi and Ani. I cant undarstand people who dont like Prequal
what a time to be alive!
Bro that guy in the background when Ewan mcgregor says his first words on the show. He got some skills with that lightsaber. My man was doing a Darth maul
why does Ewan look younger than hayden? lmao
9:27 chills!
Not going to lie the fans are kind of annoying like shut up and let them talk, God lol 😆
My brother worked on Fargo (the series) in which Ewan is EXCELLENT playing twins.  He was directing traffic using his own lightsaber, when a car pulled up and the window rolled down.  Ewan, being the lovely man he is, said to him "you're not going to get too far with that," winked and rolled away.  By all accounts, just a great dude :)
I know i'm glad seeing these two back, but man that audience member at 2:35 was clean with that lightsaber flip 👀
Lucas was far ahead of his time with his prequals, we've come to love them and hold them dear to our hearts. well, except Jarjar, but we understand his purpose for the young audience, so we've learned to ignore him LMAO
People just couldn't stop cheering. This was so wholesome.
Regal Robot !!!
I love how their suits are color coded in a way. I have no idea if it’s on purpose but I think it is. Ewan is wearing brown, Hayden is wearing black. I think it’s too much of a coincidence to be that, but if it is it’s amazing.
That sure was the "Revenge of the Prequels", seeing all those finally earned standing ovations they didn't have before. Finally something to cover up the stup1d, out of proportion backlash from almost 20 years ago.
I think I missed Anthony more than either of these two tbh
I get their hype but the crowd is annoying.
Happy to see Hayden get the love he deserves (and Ewan as well)
Hayden deserved better
Man I am in tears, they both look so good and I cannot tell you how much my heart is excited for this show! I am buzzing inside!
Jesus I haven't been this overwhelmed in my life. My cheeks hurt from smiling 😃
I love that Hayden got his Anakin-hair back!
So happy to see them and the series lots of ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
That presenter is too happy. He's like Disney-employee-happy.
Hayden must have been real nervous, he's sweaty bullets!
The key to hunting fanbase vindication... is patience.
9:39 this is where the fun begins
wow. a little weird to say , but a tiny bit of water grouped up by my eye seeing Hayden and Ewan again, smiling as the fandom embraces them. definitely a nice thing to see once again in Star Wars . I love these two, please I just hope Disney respects them in the roles they made for them.
This show will be Hayden`s revanche to the critics and the Golden Raspberry Awards who nominated him for Worst Supporting Actor as Anakin. Us the fans are going to love this, we waited so long for this reunion to take place.
The people who love the prequels were kids at that time. Now we are grown and the haters are old hahahaha
God Bless Ewan and Hayden, making our dreams come true on screen 🙏  and the producers behind the scenes
I absolutely love that Ewan is in brown and white and Hayden is in all black, they look very dapper "modern" versions of their characters
"this is where fun begins"
I cant stand Disney pressenters... They're just insufferable Edit: I cant stand Disney events. Its been 6 minutes and all I've heard is screaming. F this Edit 2: its been 9 minutes and they're still screaming...
These guys haven't aged a day, its phenomenal.
At least the sequels were so bad that it made people go back and watch the prequels and realize that they weren't so bad. Now Hayden and Ewan can recieve they love they deserved back when the prequels first came out.
When the function got Hennessy
Love the detail of they are dressing like a contemporary Jedi and Sith
people gotta stop making the sand jokes... what are you, 50?
We are getting Hayden in Ashoka’s flash backs!  If only in my dreams!
**"This is where the fun begins"** **Crowd goes wild**
can somebody gif the "this is where the fun begins" line and the host's reaction
Hayden has my respect, so does Ewan✊ big upps to them!
So cool seeing em back
So freakin happy for Hayden who also looks soo good, 13 year old me is geeked! Lmao
Ewan "I don't so aging" McGregor! Seeing Hayden back is the icing on this most delicious cake!
9:10 Man, Hayden was so emotional right there 😭
dude the prequels are the reason i am Star Wars FAN!!! originals were good dont get me wrong but for me the prequels are the REASON!!!! Im so fricking happy for hayden!! Im so hyped for him to came back after all he went thru! for me he played anakin in best way anyone could! Anikin after all is my favorite SW charachter!! LESTTTS GOOO!!
Man. They have NOT aged. It’s remarkable.
Oh my goodness, seeing Hayden and Ewan so much older . Man the childhood memories hit different . They have aged like fine wine 🍷. Love them a lot .
I just saw the 2 parts. It’s as beautiful as the prequels……
Bruh the crowd need to stop interrupting it's so annoying 😂😂
The amount of screaming and cheering is wild.  They deserve it though, and I love that they are being appreciated more and more, especially Hayden.
Oh yes Darth Vader is proud of the introduction . You (The host) will make an brilliant INQUISTITOR.  Obi wan and Vader :- Finally we meet atleast
09:42 The smile on Hayden's face says it all. After 20 years and a trashy disney trilogy his role as Anakin is finally vindicated and he sees that the fans appreciate  him and the prequel trilogy as much as the original trilogy.
Those 3 minutes of applause if just epic and that moment at 4:29 Hayden really desvere this. xD   I know he was not the best actor but for me he will always be Anakin. I hear his voice when i read EUs novels with Anakin in it. :)
2:37 cool
It was Revenge of the Sith dumbass not attack of the Clones That was this last on-screen appearance
When will Kathlen Kenedy be away from Star War's???? PLEASE!!!!
Don't touch me! I'm crying! So happy for these two!
I can see Crabbok in the background!
Hayden has them in the palm of his hand.
My boy is back 😭
I wish I was there lol
These two lads have some of the most infectious smiles out there. Prequels were awesome imo. I go back and watch em often...
THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS!!!!!! I'M SOOOOOO EXCITED FOR  OBI-WAN KENOBI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Really happy for Hayden. I was 23 when Attack of the Clones came out, and even then (before social media), I thought the dude was getting a raw deal with how fans (& my own friends) were reacting. A lot of misplaced vitriol - and around the same time, Life as a House came out and he was incredible in it so I knew it wasn't him, it was the script. But man, I loved him in Revenge of the Sith - that movie like most still had issues, but it certainly had nothing to do with him. He just seemed to be who the toxic members of the fanbase focused their nastiness on, for some reason (they'd ruined Jake Lloyd's life, so apparently they had to find someone else to hate). But now as a 43 year-old, I've been fortunate to live long enough to see many "legacy characters" - as they're being called now - come back, age appropriate, to revisit and cap off their character's stories and finally be embraced by the fandom and it makes my heart sing. Really hoping the show's quality and story do his ability justice.
❤❤❤❤❤
I love the shows and Im speaking for everyone, but we need a movie. the euphoria of watching starwars in the big screen is bigger than us(literally)
I want to get in hayden's face to tell him that he made my childhood awesome.
I love their choices of wardrobe 😍  is it coincidence?
All it needed was a ‘Hello there’ at the start from Ewan..
They holdin the mic in the intro like lightsabers
So great!
My throat is all rough and scratchy right now from watching this whole Live event earlier. When I drink anything it just makes it worse lol 💀 I should have never freaked out so much.
I am soooo happy seeing those icons, those heroes of my whole childhood back together… man I am so hyped
He said it
HAYDEN AND EWAN ARE LITERALLY MY CHILDHOOD HEROES ❤️
This show is looking like a mess... Two massive plot holes in one episode? This is bad man
Hayden will always personify Darth Vader.
the Dude at 2:37 in background :O
Watching this just made me smile from ear to ear. I love that Ewan and Hayden are excited like we are and how they're such big fans of the trilogy as well. ❤️ I love being apart of this community, it's just so wholesome and this trilogy has really changed my life and Ewan and Hayden are a big part in that and I wanna say thank you sooo much to them for this series. ❤️
This makes me so happy to see. All this fan love was so overdue. Next on our list, Ahmed Best.
FINALLY HAYDEN GETS HIS CREDIT
When Hayden said "This is where the fun begins." I lost it!  That gave me absolute life! And when everyone cheered immediately when he said that line, it was so wholesome. 🥰🥰🥰
Glad to see these icons again, EP3 is still my fav in the saga!
I must say... Sometimes these roles in movies can really be damaging, especially to young actors. Hayden Christensen wasn't really setup for success with those prequels. He is a good actor (see "Life As A House"), so seeing him, all these years later, still getting some good vibes from fans and the crowd, it's great to see. Hopefully he's making some sweet money, too.
anyone notice that sick saber spin at 2:38 in the background behind ewan? props to that dude
Just seeing them together and I'm 20 y/o again... Hayden deserves so much the recognition fans finally give him... I think he was a great Anakin...
I never understood why Hayden got so much hate. He portrayed Anakin perfectly!
Both actors are dressed in the dress colors of their characters. Small details...
What did the dude from the crowd scream, where Hayden answers "Yes, we are"?
The people who hated on Hayden and the prequels, I'll bet you they absolutely regret what they've done. They had it too good. The moment Disney took over and started the implement their woke marry-Sue storytelling, the fans understood what they lost. Look at the fan love.
We were there earlier but left to check out stuff before they came on. There was no guest schedule listed, and I read on the Star Wars website that Ewan was coming Friday. I'm absolutely gutted.
Hayden looks good in this interview! really looks like the younger anakin here
Remember these are just actors not actual characters and thus they  should not be held on this pedestal and payed god knows how much money  just for appearing in one movie or episode...minimal wages for actors! and directors too!
Only love for Star Wars, only love. All Star Wars.
I'm TsezoSkywalkerBG. Have we met on Battlefront 2? :D
if someone edited a version of this interview without the fans yelling the video would be like 3 minutes haha, love how enthusiastic everyone is at these characters
My hero’s
this show so far was amazing
Hayden Christensen is now even sounds like Anakin from The Clone Wars!
Hello there
Spida boys represent!
This makes me so happy. People actually appreciating Hayden!!
9:39 yes
That crowd is atrocious… Cutting them off and screaming. Just let them speak.
Obi wan not even the star of his own show🙄🙄
Dude I got wwe vibes when they walked out and had mics in hand
Why is this peoplen so immature? You can like sw but youre not 19 anymore..
Must be weird for Hayden to be back in the spotlight like this after 15 years, and kind of for Ewan as well, even though he’s been acting still he hasn’t been in anything with this big of a fanbase since Revenge of the Sith.
These two genuinely sound like they had a good time making this show. That is always a really good sign, if the actors seem really into it and are happy to do all of the promoting then good decisions were made regarding their characters. It was a great idea to bring Hayden back. Even though he's in a suit and the voice isn't his, having Hayden doing all the moves will bring an immediate authenticity to Vader. There will be chances to see Vader in his downtime where he reflects more as Anakin than the monster he became. I'm also hoping they have a few flashbacks to their previous adventures with that fantastic de-aging deepfake technology they used for Luke Skywalker. What would be awesome is if the two characters reminisce about the same thing but remember the events very differently, with Obi-Wan remembering something fondly and Vader being all bitter and twisted about it.
I always loved Anakin growing up and now people that hated him are bandwagonning onto his character smh
Great content greater people
50% of the video: then actually talking Other 50%: Crowd cheering and not letting them speak
It’s very hype seeing these two Star Wars Legends in the Star Wars Celebration. This Is Where The Fun Begins.
Thank you so much for bringing them back!
Mayhem. Pure mayhem
This is where the fun begins!!!!
i’m a happy ewan and hayden are seeing all this love they truly deserve it
Good to see Hayden realising we love his work, this guy is amazing
This series is a must see, its just amazing, what a good job!
I like that they wore appropiately coloured clothing for Obi Wan and Anakin.
"You were his brother" - legendary comment.
this makes me very happy
I love that he says that don't talk to him about sant 😂
I’m so happy to see those two working together again. And hopefully they know now just how great they are to the SW fans and not the critics BS because they are nothing but hater’s. Hayden played the roll of Anakin perfect all the way up to Darth Vader. And to me all three episodes are awesome and fits perfect with the originals episodes. I don’t know if they will ever see these comments but thank you both for your wonderful performance
This is gonna be lit
I died on the inside when Hayden said the meme. I think he did too lol
Man this is heartwarming
This interviewer interrupts far too much
WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE .
What was your reaction when you see order 66 when Captain Rex  was in ?
Man I’m so so ready to see them fight or even talk to each other in the new series
❤❤so thrilled to see them again together! Thank you Hayden and Ewan for coming back!
I dont care if this series is good, im just happy that after all this time Hayden and Ewan finally know that they are just as appreciated by many as Hamill, Ford and Fischer were back in their day.
Jesus Christ this crowd is irritating
They even dressed in the colors of their robes lmaoo
It's absolutely amazing seeing these two on stage together 👌 and when Hayden said the thing 😱😱😱😱
Hayden: “This is where the fun begins” Everyone: “HE DID THE THING!”
Man, I truly underestimated how ppl actually enjoy StarWars.
We always liked Obi-Wan/Ewan but seeing Hayden getting love for his role (Finally) after all these years make me so happy. People didn't understand he was suppose to play an angsty awkward teenage/young adult so they bashed him for his acting. I'm glad, people finally understood THAT was his ROLE, NOT his ACTING.
Loved this interview, huge smile while watching this all the way through! I noticed both Ewan and Hayden had their jedi robe colors goin on with their outfits, whether that was intentional or not was a nice touch.   Happy Star Wars celebration everyone! 🥳
Even on stage they're dressed as their characters; Ewan in brown and white and Hayden in all black 😁
Audience kept interrupting and that got annoying after a bit.
W everything
The way I’m tearing up seeing Ewan and Hayden understand the love most of us ALWAYS had for them, and how beautifully VINDICATING it must feel for them. ❤
I wish i could watch all of the live but it was middle of the night in my country.
Already watched the 2 episode Obi Wan it was already exciting not going spoil the fun there was lot of thrilling part of villains
Shot in Australia?! My home country!
Let's not ignore the mad lad in the back at 2:37 with the red lightsaber.  Nice work on the backhand twirl.
You were my brother Anakin🔥
I think Ewan McGregor is perfect playing the younger Obi-One-Kenobe. I wish Alec Guinness & Ewan McGregor could have done a sit down interview like this. I think Alec Guinness would have liked Ewan McGregor.
Can we stop with the sand memes now? It’s pretty obvious Hayden doesn’t care for them.
Can’t wait to watch Kenobi later 😁 let’s hope Disney deliver again just like they have with TFA R1 The Mandalorian & TBOBF!!
I was waiting for Ewan's first words to be "Hello there!" 😭  2:55:59 AM (yep!) 5/27/2022  Half way through watching it now! 😄
I love the Prequels - of course i would cut some scenes - but i still love them. I watch the movies every year - and i am so happy to see those two guys und the biggest part of my childhood again👍
Did he patch things up with his son?
I can’t express how happy I am for Hayden
Long hair Hayden 👀
Hayden is my Loveeee i know im 🤪 crazy Fan !!
Are you guys ready?? 💯🧔🥳
2:38 the guy in the background has been practicing that move since he was 7 years old!
This makes me tear up, my literal child hood sitting before my eyes once again, to deliver us a Star Wars story. I can’t believe it’s happening.
The passion of this cast and these fans is just so fantastic ❤️❤️❤️
I love Prequel Era! Ewan and Hayden are the best!
That was cool. First episode 5/5. At last a really really good SW series from Disney.
The crowd kinda got annoying real quick. Let them speak, sheesh.
Hayden deserved this
Reva stinks
Disney does not deserve these guys.....
May the force be with you everyone!
The outfits are perfect
What did the guy shout at 9.00 ?
this is great !!!!!
Ben Affleck
Haha they need two whlte mens agains, what happen with the girl and the other?
Why does Ewan look younger than Hayden tho
"This is where the fun begins!" Oh Hayden you just made yourself a legend!
How many jedi`s in the room, academy graduation day, ye?
“this is where the fun begins” what a legend. the audience reaction is what makes me happy to be a star wars fan
Ewan should have sayed "Hello there" when he arrived!
That spin tho 2:37
*smiles and chuckles*
Can someone tell the host his shirt is 2 sizes to big?
me mie....
Must be weird for Haydan, coz he got soooooooo much hate and backlash back in 2002-2005 for the prequels and his acting as Anakin, so to come back to people cheering him and loving him is a total 180⁰ turn.  So glad he's back!!! 🤩🤩🤩
Should have Hayden come back and do a Darth Vader series!
I loved him in Jumper
*This is where the fun begins*
Hayden!!!
it makes me so sad that for years they thought people hated the movies but now LOOK AT ALL THE LOVE AAHH. you can see how happy it makes hayden and ewan i’m so happy for them both, love you 🫶🫶
Holy hell, these two have barely aged at all!
the crowd is awesome, love how hyped they are
Don't care about the acting critics. He IS Anakin Skywalker.
Hayden looks like he's going to cry in happiness the whole time.  😭  so heart-warming people love him now instead of dragging his name in the sand.
Hayden: Everyone keeps asking me if I'm back. I think I'm back!
They’re both the 🐐
2 legends together...THIS IS FULL ON EPIC NOSTALGIC
Plz dont be a bait and switch pls for the love of god... make this about Obi and Vader PLZZZZ!!!!
I don't even understand the criticism about Hayden. To me he absolutely nailed it, no one could have been better than him. I guess it's just losers being jealous of him.
I like how everyone in the celebration has the same hair cut as their characters
Young Leia is amazing in this, I did not expect that plot line but wow the casting and acting is so perfect and it makes sense in the grander scheme of things. First two episodes are great.  Spoiler Warning:       To all the people saying the Grand inquisitor would get fight scenes and thats why they made it more practical, I mean that does not hold up well anymore. Still loved the depiction as I just contributed it to the characterized style of the animated series'
With  all those Star Wars fans, Ewan must always say first "Hello there" xD
I got chills when Hayden said "This is where the fun begins"
Happy hayden gets the love he deserves. Great guy
Man the difference between Star Wars fans in person, and Star Wars fans online, is night and day.
The prequels are just as good as the originals. The acting and emotion was incredibly moving
“HAYDEN HAYDEN HAYDEN” Hearing that just… there’s nothing like it. I’m so happy for Hayden. He deserves this.
Heavy criticism caused Hayden to quit acting but...  This guy really looks like a decent person, someone you can relate to.
This is crazy, Thanks god im still alive to watch this live
Wave your glowy sticks, that's right, CLAP FOR STAR WARS YAAAY, IT'S OBI ONE AND ANAKIN, FRIGGIN STAR WARS !!!!!! I CLAP BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT THAT IS.   Milk that baby dry, then milk it some more. I hope they announce the aunt Beru and uncle Owen's galactic adventure series soon. Then make one for the bartender in the cantina, i'm sure the consoomer braindeads will eat it up.   It's like watching Pavlov's dog, as soon as they hear the trigger sound (in this case STAR WARS) they start drooling and crying. Serve them a plate of doo doo, slap Star Wars on it and they'll say it's an exotic taste.
This is actually really wholesome! Hope these actors get the pay they deserve for coming back and being as excited as the fan base.
Imagine Ewan greeting the crowd with 'hello there'
Hayden sounds just like his animated counterpart Matt Lanter and I absolutely love it  This is where the fun begins, when he said that I said YES LET'S GO!!
Their clothes resemble their Jedi attire.
HA
Uhhh j was getting a tattoo done I can’t believe I missed this x_x
Man, what legends
I don't care what haters did to the prequels and to George Lucas' directing. I watched those movies on DVD so many times.
The interviewer was horrible. Lol
Hello there and This is where the fun begins were my favorite memes in star wars!!!
I still get sad when Anakin turns to the darkside in Revenge. I keep thinking, "No! He'll go for Palpatine, not Mace!" I've seen it dozens of times and it always gets me.
I WANT TO BE THERE RN BUT IM IN UK and have to go to school so annoyed but hope everyone has a good time
2 seconds of quiet, *that one guy* "YEAHHHHH-"
FINALLY 👏🏼 GETTING 👏🏼 THE 👏🏼 RESPECT 👏🏼 THEY 👏🏼 DESERVE 👏🏼
I'm so happy for Hayden for finally felling the love from the Star Wars fans, so well deserved.
The love these guys are finally getting is so wholesome! ☺️
Woohoo!!!
Might cry
Honestly I wish the audience would shut the hell up lol.
They sorta dressed like their characters in terms of color lol
I missed you guys too :((
He said…HE SAID THE THING
I sure hope they didn't screw this series up and we get some kickass Obi-wan/Vadar.
Ewan and Hayden 😍😍
Man I gotta get me some of those white pants
Seeing them together on stage brings warm feelings to my heart..
Hearing them cheer Hayden together gave me goosebumps 4:26 and Hayden saying “this is where the fun begins” literally brought tears to my eyes, I’m so happy to be a Star Wars fan rn
🤩😍
"This is where the fun begins" Yep. That's our Anakin. We waited for almost two decades, but now it's really happening 😭👏✊
This means a lot to me. I grew up with the prequels and it's hard to believe that these two are back in their respective roles.
In response to "this is where the fun begins"  Ewan should have totally ended with "no. Nothing too fancy" for a good but less memed line. But an excellent interview all around!
Only 11 minutes of these legends and those Americans can't even stop whooping. We must of got about 4 minutes of talking thanks to you numbskulls.
I'm just glad that these 2 are getting the love they deserve because RotS is a special movie.
Even in their normal clothing, they still look like Obi-Wan and Vader!
NEED that Beskar coffee table
That's alot of lightsabers
I hope Disney doesn't mess it up.
Loved the guy yelling "You we're my brother!" but it definitely encouraged the crowd to keep trying to do it lol.
This is where the fun beings!
Wish the crowd would shut up.
Dont make me cry
crowd kinda got annoying tbh
Didn’t love these interview questions.
I really love that they are dressed in the same colours as their characters in the show :D That's really superb!!!
That was insane
The Prequel era is the best era of Star Wars, by far.   I hope Hayden gets his own series too  - see some of the adventures of Vader on his own ........that would be sooooooo good
The smile on Hayden's face when a man screamed, "we've missed you!" was so heartwarming. I'm glad that after all of these years, he is finally seeing how appreciated and loved he is in the Star Wars fandom.
I love how ewan and hayden are dressing like their characters here and in other interviews
I love how ewan looks over to Hayden when he says “this is where the gun begins” like “come on, do it do the thing”
The appreciation towards Hayden brought tears to my eyes... He gave his best,  you can see that in 'Revenge of the Sith', how he progressed as an actor.
The Prequels have always sucked.
Can’t wait for the first episode. This is just amazing lol
I’m not even there and I was screaming 😱
The way the crowd was being really nice to Hayden and giving him lots of love makes me happy knowing about the past opinions of the movies
The force is strong with these ones
2:35 What's show off😂
Hayden!!!! ❤❤
Hayden and Ewan getting the LOVE THEY DESERVE 🔥🔥🔥
I freakking loved revenge of the sith and really glad that both these actors came back.
I heard that the real hero of this series isn't Obi-wan Kenobi but some rotten Black Chick who's hunting Obi-Wan.  That would be deeply disturbing. I hope I heard wrong.
I'll say it.  Back in the prequels, Hayden was not quite ready for the role.  The clunky dialog certainly didn't help.  Now he IS ready and so are we!
Never understood the hate by so many for the prequels as I always loved them. Love seeing so many fans showing so much enthusiasm and love for these two, especially Christian.  So excited to see these two reprise their roles in this series!!!!
Oh gosh, my childhood
anyone else noticed that hayden is wearing his black robes and ewan the brown garbs? Nice touch Sry for bad english haha
Not their outfits matching the colours of their robes in the films 😭amazing
I am so happy for them! I wish them all the best going forward!
God, can the audience not shut up for 5 seconds? I wanna listen to these guys talk but they interrupt them so much
So i need a beskar coffee table now
"I'm not crying, you're crying" 😭
9:40 I just can't get enough 😭
this made me SOSOSOSOSOSOSO happy 😭🫶 my favorite duo IS BACK!
Im so happy seeing these 2 finally getting the well deserve love
I see Hayden's growing out that hair to do some deepfake Clone Wars era flashbacks for "Ahsoka"...
"I missed you guys too"... what a class act! So stoked to see Hayden return to the franchise, and super happy for him as he seems genuinely grateful and excited.
I like how they dresses I don’t know if they did that on accident or in purpose but I like the all black like Darth on Hayden and the Obi-wan jedi robes of Ewan.
Having the crowd scream every 2 seconds made this literally unwatchable.  I get the hype of the moment but it’s a literal interview, let people talk smh
oh my god i was asleep when this happened but i love them
Watching this brings a tear to my eye. Seeing and hearing the love for Hayden gave me goosebumps. I so badly wish I was there
"it's got her singular vision throughout."  Is that a slap at disney?  I would think so.    hear that disney?
All that hard work you two men are gonna be legends you deserve the love, I hope you understand how much love the true fans have I'm 36 and I'm die hard from ny
20 years since attack of the clones? Why wouldnt you say 17 since revenge of the sith? Odd scripting
"A very wise Jedi once said, this is were the fun begins"
"This is where the fun begins" so ominous color me intrigued
Geez, I got teary-eyed a few times during this interview!  Only a couple hours now...
Jesus… the screaming hurts my ears let the actors talk
I'm not crying 😭 I'm so jealous of everyone who was there.
I was so happy when hee said “this is where the fun begins”  that i wept a little.
You're turning her against me lmao
This is honestly amazing to see. GL knew the beginning would be hate or irritation but over all, in the long run it would pay off in terms of people giving these legends the respect they deserve.
9:40 And at that exact moment, a crowd invigorated by excitement and nostalgia erupted into screams and cheers of happiness
This isnt the first time i get chills & tiny tears from this show incoming!
Best redemption arc in real life ever. So good to finally see them getting the love they deserve. 👌
AMAZING Star Wars forever this IS the way ☮️!
Cringey host
UGH WE JUST NEED ONE PERSON TO COMPLETE THE ULTIMATE TRIFECTA.....LIAM NEESON!!!!!¡
Great guests in Hayden and Ewan, poor, poor, host tho.  A poorly hidden setup line, a badly disguised reaction to it. Shrieking like a little girl. POOR.
I was screaming from behind my iPad, this is sooo cool to see the chosen one and the famed KENOBBIIIII back together.
When he started pointing and me thinking; he really is Jesus
2:37 that guy in the back is killing it
How does Hayden look 20 - 30 years older than Ewan, time has not been nice to him lol ? Ewan’s genes are wonderful, always smiling and so lovely. LOVE THAT SMILE
Hayden Christensen is just my fave. My first crush
Love how the first 4 minutes is just the crowd screaming for them ❤
It warms my heart to see people show them (especially Hayden Christensen) love now.  People were cruel, very cruel. 20 year old me didn't understand the hate then. I guess in another 20 years we'll have a Jar-Jar Binks show. I'll come back to this comment in twenty years time to report in.
As a kid and even now I never understood the hate Hayden got for his role as Anakin. as a kid I understood that the reason he acted that way was not the result of poor acting, but that Anakin never had a chance to grow up properly so he was very much like a child in an adult's body. He got angry like a kid, he cried like a kid and was selfish like a kid. The Jedi told us that Anakin was too old to begin the Jedi training because he had already lived the life of a child. So never having had the ability to grow into an adult his emotions controlled him which made him The perfect candidate for being manipulated by the Sith. I still consider the prequels the perfect Darth Vader origin stories.
9:40 My jaw DROPPED
Grandiosos los 2 ❤️
Why i cant be there too? WHYYYY?
This interview was amazing.  I'm nostalgic to see Ewan and Hayden back, the prequels were practically my childhood, can't wait for the series “this is where the fun begins”.  I really wish they could make a Clone Wars live action.
How they are now is exactly how I pictured their characters would be if Anakin did not turn to the dark side
Literally to the 1% reading this, God bless you, and may your dreams come true  stay home and stay safe and have a wonderful day 🧡
Lucas: Hayden, play annoying and immature Lucas: great job Hayden: why does everyone hate me?
Anyone else see that guy flip the red lightsaber around in the background around 2:38?
5:36 lmao
finally the people in the crowd who probably criticized hayden the most in the most negative way are finally appreciating him! i was always a fan and never once thought anythjing was bad about the prequels.
Yes, even the men were screaming like little girls. I’d be too
Whoever was holding up the RGB lightsaber is straight up a menace
I’m so glad Hayden took the time to watch The Clone Wars AND Rebels. Like come on, the commitment! While some actors and producers (Grand Inquisitor & the Halo TV Series) outright REFUSED to watch/play the source material. I hope it translates to a good performance!
They even showed up in the appropriate color suits. Obi-Wan got brown of jedi robe and white of jedi general armor piece and Anakin got all dark
Big lil Ani, and the other Big Ben lol.  Hayden bringing Vaders sexy back
Clone Wars did wonders for the prequel trilogy. The show gave the movies SO much more depth, as well as the characters.
HE SAID THE THING
Hayden's voice has matured a lot. Can't wait to see him return.
2:37 so no one else peeped homie causally busting out moves like a boss
We are the one with the force.
Hundreds of grown men screaming like teenage girls.
It is SO. FREAKING. GOOD. To see Hayden back, again, and all of the love that he is getting.  *This is where the fun begins!*
🔥🔥🙌
This was a great moment. Like, just fantastic to see just before the new series airs.   Also though, it's Hayden ChriSTENson Not ChriSTIANson. And he last played Vader in 2005, so 17 years ago rather than 20. Also he technically didn't play Darth Vader in Attack of the Clones in 2002 at all. He played just Anakin as he didn't turn to the dark side until episode 3.  I just had to get that out of the way, but otherwise this was awesome!
9:40 This is where the fun begins
This is where the fun begins !!!
I can't believe I'm watching two series tonight. Stranger Things and this. I NEED TO GO ON SICK LEAVE TODAY HAHAHA
No one could do the role of Anakin Skywalker better than Hayden Christensen....
I got actual goosebumps at the introduction wow
yo they’re straight up edging us
All the chills
As a zoomer who turns 22 on Wednesday I'd like to state that the prequels were good and yes ofc I watched the og trilogy first
Host was a tool telling Obinwan to keep his hands in his pockets. Energy was great
I'm opening this with a quote form the guy with the mic.  "and he's also brought with him, a guy, who's uncle was in a new hope..."  ....😐 Well, I'm at a loss for words! I've seen 'a new hope' enough to know Obi wan's uncle WASN'T in that movie!   Here's another quote... "How hype are you all for this show?"  Not very.....it looks like another classic adisney 'Bait and Switch' where the title character gets shafted by the diverse sith inquisitor we see A LOT OF, in the trailer....!
Wow I’m assuming they won’t ever encounter each other in this series though
The right star Wars fans showed up to give thanks to Hayden and Ewan
I have failed you Anakin, I have failed you
It wouldn't be America without the patented woopfest before the interview.. 😅
I’ll give this to both Ewan and Hayden they had immeasurable patience for this crowd.  I’ve missed these two kiddos
Where can we get those chairs and table??
they both still look so amazing. and its kind of bittersweet seeing the fandom actually love and respect Hayden now. for years and years he only got hate and ridicule from SW community for his role, more than any other actor... as everything from from with a move was on him.
So it means I'm going to watch because Hayden is there haha.
9:40 You're welcome
What a joke! Man going through these comments there are bots galore.
"THE CIRCLE IS NOW COMPLETE"  this is surreal
3:56 Hayden plays who??
This is great and all... but have you ever heard the tragedynof Darth Plagueis the Wise?
So cool
And of course they wear their colors just like in the movies I love them 💯❤️❤️
Guys. It’s weird. I’ve got a… good? Feeling about this???
Would've been epic if Ewan said "your move" to Hayden and then Hayden saying "this is where the fun begins." 💯💯💯
"This is where the fun begins." sent chills down my spine and a smile on my face. grew up with the prequels and i am now 26 years old. cant believe this is coming out tomorrow
I HAVE A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THIS.
I'm absolutely thrilled that Hayden is getting so much support, cheers, praise, hype. He deserves all of it and more
But - where's Jar Jar?  😢
One might say;  The circle is now complete. When we last saw Hayden; he was but the learner; now he is the master.
hello there
I really wish there is a live action movie during the Clone Wars era starring Hayden, Ewan amd Temuera.
I have to wait til work is over to see the show tomorrow but it’ll be the best way to start the weekend
Hayden did such a good job,regardless of the poor material, in transmitting the different mental and emotional turmoils that Anakin Skywalker went through that when I rewatched Return of the Jedi , it is Hayden (Anakin) I see as Darth Vader at the moment he desides to kill the Emperor.
Seeing these two together in 2022 makes me feel so emotional
Just like Andrew Garfield, I'm loving Hayden's redemption arc.
Incredible. I’m so happy after watching this. The love shown? Every shoutout to Hayden was spot on. He deserves all the love
So cringe having to wait for everyone to stop screaming after every 3 words these guys say.
I literally tear up when Hayden said "This is where the fun begins", such a legendary moment
They should’ve given Ewan a lever to raise his chair so he’d have the high ground
Seeing Hayden happy and getting all the love he deserves brings warm feelings to my heart
Hayden knows how to make a crowd really happy
I mean I love them both, but screaming everytime they say something
Hayden: this is where the fun begins Reddit: WE DID AGAIN BOYS!!
in tears!!!!! CAN'T WAIT!
Hayden and Ewan: *Breathes* The crowd: WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This is where the fun begins
I feel like hayden isn't used to this level of fans lol. He looks nervous
I mean I love them both, but screaming everytime they say something
I know noting about the series we're all about to watch...because i'm tired of spoilers for ALL movies. I don't watch many trailers anymore either. With that said, hearing Ewan say that Deborah Chow directed ALL of the episodes.....is really great news. Keeping the same director over all episodes keeps the vision in line. Mandalorian had a few directors and you could tell the difference in the tone.  Can't wait to see it.
this is where the fun begins......OH MY GAWD!!!!!! YOU BROUGHT BACK FEELINGS AND EXCITEMENT HIDDEN IN MY HEART FROM 12 YRS OLD!! AHH!!!
Love this! D+
It’s cool that they’re both dressed in similar colors to Darth Vader and Obi Wan
MY FAV JEDI MASTERS!!!!!
I want to meet Hayden and literally just tell him how much I loved his performance in the prequels. He needs to know how much we love him and his work and how excited we are to have him back.
Say what you want about Hayden, but he is a fantastic actor, he was just awfully directed  and written as Anakin. I am so happy he's back, he deserves this redemption.
These guys are just smiling, waving and collecting that paycheck at this point lol
When is it gonna release? Next 4 hours?
that guy behind them at 2:36 did such a cool spin
Fun fact, there has been more time since these guys were playing these roles in episode 3 than between episode 6 and phantom menace
LET'S GO!!!
Reunited and it feels so good
Wow Ewan looks like he hasn’t aged a day. It blew my mind it’s been over 20 years.
What does that dude in the crowd shout at 5:36? The thing that makes Hayden say “Yes we are.” I keep replaying it but can’t understand him at all.
It's just so awesome seeing these guys get the love they deserve. The prequels got trashed pretty hard and it really had nothing to do Hayden and Ewan, it was the writing. Glad to see they're getting another go with more support from fans
Darth Vader toys are rightfully labeled as being a choking hazard.
I just LOVE  HAYDEN CHRISTENSON...he's still got it...in spades!
If I were Hayden I would've put shades on right after I said this is where the fun begins,  😎😎😎😎.
I think it would've been great if Ewan's opening phrase was "Hello there."
You can tell the host actually cares about these actors and their movies. Great job.
2:39 I think that's a sith in the background
Absolutely loving how their wardobes reflect their characters' outfits.
HAYDEN AND EWAN THE GOATS
Hype!!!!!! We need a sand reference!!!!
seeing all the sabers..... yall amazing
2:36 dude in the back just casually hits one of the sickest spins like it’s nothing 😂
He didn't start with 'Hello There'????   SO UNCIVILISED.
“This is where the fun begins” OMG HE SAID IT AHHHHHHH
Hello there
We really gonna get CW Anakin with how Haysen sounds now.
Wow! Hayden sound exactly like Clone Wars Anakin. If i didn't know. I would have thought he voice it
Hayden finally receiving the love he deserves.
its great to see   Hayden getting so much love
Why don't the microphones look like light sabers?... this is low hanging fruit people, come on...🙄
I love that during all the promotional interviews for the show Hayden has been wearing all black in true Vader fashion
We gonna talk about the absolute Sith lord breaking out that lightsaber flip in the background??👀
Not gonna lie but I didn't like episodes 1,2,and 3 but it was a story that had to be told and hayden christensen is forever darth vader, very proud for him
Someone please control the audience. Shut them up for God's sake. I know they're excited but stop participating.
oh my gosh. hayden is back.
Loved that intro by Anthony Carboni
crappy introduction... do better ... your working with stars
The audience is so cringe and I accept them for it...
We NEED a Vader series with Hayden back. Do the right thing Disney!
"This is where the fun begins" who else screamed and cried!!! My childhood crushes are baaack and are finer than ever 😭😭😭
I feel bad when actors get blamed for bad writing and directing. I hope they do amazing on this show. I hope Hayden does great and we get a Vader series too, I've loved the comic.
The people shouting while they’re talking is mad annoying, embarrassing frankly, can people not control themselves?
The crowd is so annoying like let then talk not trying to have them be interrupted every 5 seconds.
The Jedi….will never end.
Not a fan of the sequel trilogy but I loved the cast. So I hope they’ll get the same adoration as these two in 20 years (and get to “redeem” in a new Star Wars project).
So funny. people shouting they love them Both.... but remember when it was all just in cinemas in the early 2000's you HATED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM !
2:37 No one gonna notice this chad in the back that nailed a saber trick on camera? Lmao
SO happy that Hayden and Ewan are getting the recognition they deserved for their work. Say what you will about the prequels, but the issue was more or less due to George’s dialog writing. They did so much with the awful writing they were given, and they are so not given enough credit for it.
Couldn't help but notice how they were both dressed. I see what you did there.
and Lucas what?
Hayden:'-)
2:38 that guy in the background is the 10th brother
Could you imagine if Ewan had said “hello there” when they first came out? The place would’ve erupted.
“This is where the fun begins.” That was perfect!
We can tell Hayden isn't used to receiving this much love from Star Wars fans lol this is so wholesome!
It's great to see Hayden again and I hope to see that this helps him get out there. I liked him in the two movies and am a star wars fan for life, but I'm glad to see him back.
Seeing the healing star wars has went through brings the happiest of tears to my eyes. These characters that mean the world to people being brought back and given respect, the actors getting the love they are deserved. It's beautiful. I hope the best for this series and especially going forward with more. I just hope we do not get let down.  Hearing hayden saying the iconic line, years later at 9:40 hit me on so many levels.
Born in 2000. The prequels are underrated still. I'm gonna rewatch the six movies soon.
Seeing Hayden finally get love after getting so much hate is amazing
Two great actors and the most annoying audience.
everyone: OMG HE SAID THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS!!!  me: yo that guy at 2:38 is an upcoming sith lord
I was so happy I cried
Did the host mispronounce Hayden’s surname??
2:37 Shoutout to the Sithlord lightsaber skills!
THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS
I'm glad Hayden is getting so much love now and I'm sure he will be great in the show.
This brought tears to my eyes.
My man said christ"ian"sen when he introduced em
Man I’m happy for Hayden Christensen, he was so hated for his portrayal of a anakin and now it’s a complete reversal in attitude towards him and his character. Anakin and specifically his portrayal of anakin has always been my favorite part of Star Wars (followed by Ewan and Obi-Wan)  Side note: I personally never thought anything was wrong with his acting or lines in the prequels, but for those that did it’s incredible that they allowed a single line about sand to ruin their entire perception of the prequels
YEAH!!!
I will be devastated if this show gets poor reception because these two are finally back, and finally seeing the love we’ve had for years, and I’d hate for that to be ripped away from them with Disney Star Wars haters
That lightsaber flip at 2:37
That crowd is annoying
"Is there anything you want to say?" Me, internally: Say the line, Bart "This is where the fun begins" Me, externally: HE DID IT! HE SAID THE LINE!!!
I truly don’t get why people hated him and Star Wars (company) shunned him. He did his best with what he got, I’m so happy for him to come back!
Hayden was never the problem.  Hayden is a good actor who was made a scapegoat with a poor script done by George Lucas.  If Lucas had handed the reigns of the script writing for the first 3 movies to someone else, the prequel trilogy wouldn't be an embarrassment it is today.
so cool wow and big of fan star wars movie  and loveObi Wan Kenobi tv show  and my favorite  actor Hayden Christensen as anakin skywalker as darth vader and  my favorite actor Ewan McGregor  as Obi Wan Kenobi 😍🤩🥰😘
All these poor poor people about to be very disappointed.
tbh I get social anxiety just looking at that crowd
Something tells me this show might have some flaws
fans
I love how Hayden was welcomed with open arms by fans
The pillars of civilization
Why was I crying!!!!!!!
lol look at theses babsos
The heroes' we didn't deserve but definitely the ones we needed. 👀👀👀
I hope Hayden know that people really love him
Teared up seeing Hayden!
Those hecklers got really annoying really quickly. When guests can't finish a sentence you need to stop yelling
There will only ever be one Anakin, and that's Hayden
Are we not gonna talk about the guy with the red lightsaber spinning it behind the two?
This is what we want star wars to be
So it’s we gonna be able to see it at 12 ?
Even their suits fit their characters outfits
🤩 "THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS" 🤘🏾🔥💯
You can see the happiness in hayden's eyes. You can tell he waited  years for this treatment. The respect he deserves. I feel so happy for him
So exciting
I hope this show succeeds for their sake I want to see them do more things in the future this show is very important it’s after revenge of the sith before a new hope it’ll change how we view the original trilogy and even clone wars and the prequels
I love that they’re wearing the same color clothes from episode 3.
anaking look sus
They really did it because of us
These guys didn't age a frickin day. Extremely humble, extremely polite. They kept themselves looking sharp and fit throughout this entire time. Great couple of dudes.
6:00 for me growing up I watched the OT and loved it, then the prequels came out and loved them too but obviously love the OT a bit more, as I got older and started to use the internet for a few years I was surprised to see people disliked the movies and the actors in it, I really loved playing with my clone wars toys both action figures and Lego guys, I feel like most of the hate came from the most vocal while the ones who liked the movie didn’t know or speak up about their love for the movies, that or they were drowned out from the loudest ones or were like me just a kid who didn’t know that much lol
I mean Victor biggest stroke of just pure walk in the prequel trilogy with the fact that the two of them work together so well. Plus they both really are kind of those characters like I thought these only one use definitely Anakin Skywalker like yeah that's totally always see always thought Anakin would be like this like cocky kind of Moody angsty doodoo dislike really needed someone to give him a hug and no one did
He said the thing!
Oh my gosh let them talk
History is being made today
EPIC
"This is where the fun beggins"
Ok now I just want a full series about vader
Woo-hoo!
This is where the fun begins 😏
with haydens height he really fits the role of early darth
They both look really good given 20 years has passed!!! But I really feel happy for HC...he got a lot of sh*t originally for the role of Anakin. And in truth it wasn't his fault at all...it was an iconic and very deep character that had to be played by a young actor...I think most young actors would have struggled. Plus the films weren't great...and that was Lucas' fault, not his.  Ironically the birth of Darth Vader may now represent the rebirth of HC!
Love them both can’t wait
I like hot Hayden always wear black while Ewan chooses something lighter.... perfect for their characters
Look how they respected my boys😭❤
He said the thing!!!!
Hell to the yeah! Wow to the wow! Stoked for this series!
2:36 you little trickster you
9:40. Oh my gosh, he said it!! He said the line!
That room has to smell funky
I gotta say that that is very heartwarming that Hayden is actually being welcomed with opened arms among the fandom after getting really bashed back then.
09:30 Epic
I wonder if actor star (HAYDEN CHRISTENSEN) might ever become interested playing a character in either M.C.U. entertainment, or in the (DC E.U.) someday?  I also wonder if actor star (HAYDEN CHRISTENSEN) might ever become interested acting in Suspenseful, ScienceFiction movies someday?
Lo guapo de hayden wey 😍
Just let them talk will you crowd.
So this is how Star Wars fans react, with thunderous applause?! So hyped for the new show!!
It's all led up to this...
What's happening with Train spotting two is that movie still happening ewan ????
What a time to be alive
this brings a tear to my eye.
is anybody realized that ewan wore obi wan colour outfit while hayden wore the darth vader/anakin colour outfit? its just matched them perfectly!
I’m not gonna lie the audience is kind of annoying but that would totally be me
Best birthday gift ever
You know, no matter how you felt about the prequel trilogy, you can't fault these two for giving it their all and making a memorable duo. I'm really glad to see Ewan return as Obi-Wan, but I'm also ecstatic that Hayden is at last getting some recognition for his contributions. I think his new take of an older Anakin will be super interesting.
I’m just happy they back baby. STAR WARS! Let’s go!
9:26 One of the most wholesome moments in history.
9:15 "I missed you guys, too."  Who's cutting onions in here?
Well played with their outfit’s. Hayden in a black suit and Ewan in a brown jacket to match their Star Wars characters!
Hayden Christensen Aamzing Actor absolut Great Performance !!!!!!!
It’s been 17 years and they look exactly the same
He didn't say "Hello There" when he walked in 🥺
can we talk about there clothing colours again pleaase hayden in all black and ewan wearing white with the biege coat
Hayden Christensen never deserved the hate he got, he did a great job as Anakin and I can't wait to see Obi-Wan Kenobi tomorrow
I, happy dean and Hayden are sitting next to together I just which that Natalie Portman was by them too cause that would complete the set.
Now people have truly realised that the prequels were by no means as bad as they thought, regardless of their flaws. So I'm happy to see these men getting the credit they deserve for the efforts they put in.
Bait and Switch, my comments are fading.
I actually really liked this interview, interviewer did an amazing job, the comment about the ending of revenge of the sith was hilarious “don’t tell me I haven’t seen it yet” 😂
Imagine how wild the crowd would have been if Ewan started with "Hello There".
Fun little nod there. They are wearing their respective jedi robe colors haha well played
I went to see episode 1 4 times at the movies when it came out and that was the only Star Wars movie I saw more time’s at the movies then the other’s
hey, you miusspeleld evan
SO HAPPY TO SEE THE FANS FINALLY ACCEPTING HAYDEN AFTER 17 YEARS AND PROPS TO HIM FOR COMING BACK AFTER HIS BAD EXPERIENCE.
That intro probably sounded better in his head..
Hayden still looks so young
*visible happiness*
Niiiiice!
The crowd is so annoying.🤣
2:36 We can see Dark Maul's hidden apprentice in the background, showing us his lightsaber skills
The whole thing is scripted/pre-meditated but the host makes it way too obvious with: "He also brought with him a guy who's uncle was in a New Hope & he also plays Obi-Wan"... what!?! This guy even stated he hasn't watched the very content these guys were previously in that he's trying to sell. Whoever wrote the script does not know SW. Even having Ewan stating that is was 20 years since the last film when its only been 17.
While the original trilogy will always be "my" star wars movies, when the prequels came out I could appreciate as an adult that there was no way to make all fans happy. Given a choice between the prequels & sequels - I'd actually take the prequels even though I'll always love the OT characters that came back.  I'm glad that those for whom the prequels were "their" star wars movies, have grown up to give Hayden the fan-love he should have always had. And he has my respect (as does Ewan in his EP role) to come back to this franchise after the way the media & fandom crapped on him when the films came out.   As many here have pointed out - all the actors were working with the material given. Even the best actor can only make s*** smell but so good.
😭😭😭😭😭 I so happy for You, baby 🥲 you deserve a world. Love you ❤
Hello there
Loved seeing Hayden and Ewan on stage
Many will appreciate the Prequels now i bet
❤️❤️
Lord Vader, command me.
Legends
No matter how long it’s been hearing Hayden say “this is where the fun begins “ for kenobi made me laugh and at the same time feel hopeful for the future of Star Wars !
1 of the best jobs in the world is to be able to come back to a Star wars movie or show
I love Star Wars
I legitimately screamed and clapped in my room when Hayden said the thing. I didn’t expect it and just brought so much happiness to me
Awesome and Excellent
Tears in the eyes, full body chills, indeed Hayden, THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS!
SWCA. Where adults go to cry like pathetic babies.
Bro why wouild they bring him back, I have no doubt that he's a fine actor but darth vader isn't his character, it's James Earl Jones's. Even Matt Lanter did a better job as Anakin, if he's just gonna wear the suit just bring him back as the voice of Anakin. It just seems like a such a shallow play by Disney to prey on the fans' nostalgia.
This probably wasn’t intentional, but I love that Ewan is wearing Jedi robe colors for his outfit while Hayden is wearing all black like Vader.
Hayden Christensen could play a young Mad Max if given a chance after Vader.
I like how they dressed kind of like their characters brown/white for obiwan and black for Vader
I can't help but smile the whole time watching this and seeing them together again
WAIT, his uncle was Alec..?!
yeah i wanna hear then talk not the obnoxious crowd.
This was so insane to see in person today! These gentlemen are a class act!!
Wow my childhood~ When I watched episode II, I loved Anakin. I didnt watched episode I and the old trilogy before episode II. It was my very first star wars film. well it's not like I am a star wars fan. So Didnt even understand why some people gave bad critics to the movie and Hayden. I loved it, To me he was perfect, his character was great. Then I decided to watch the rest of the movies.  and I felt so betrayed when I watched episode III, I knew what was coming, but Anakin broke my heart. I mean that was what he supposed to do. Whole story was about his turn to the dark side. It was amazing to me.  Later on, when I watched the spin offs and last episodes, I realized I would never love a star wars trilogy more than episodes I II III, no matter  how much people trash on it, or hate it, It's about how these movies were the first I watched from the franchise (episode II especially) and so, to me, no other can match the emotions those movies, made, and still to day, make me feel. Will always be my favorites, no matter what anyone else says or thinks.
Tis show us how Star Wars fans are strong 🥺🥺🥺♥️♥️♥️♥️
I wonder if Hayden likes sand or not.
This is some weird kind of fandom…like a political rally
These two are my childhood heroes. I wanted to be as cool as Hayden and suave as Ewan. Also had a crush on Natalie Portman (still do) lol. So happy to see them get the love and admiration they’ve deserved for so long! “This is where the fun begins 😏”
If it ends up good like everyone is hoping, theyll realize hayden and ewen are cash cows and make more lol.
It took a full 2 minutes and 38 seconds before either of them said a word
I’ll tell you what. I’d love to have been there. I wish so badly they’d shut up in the back so I could hear them more. I hope so much more badly that they are truly the main characters and it’s not mainly about that girl.
It would be fantastic if Ewan had said "hello there" to the fans.
I am so happy to see them back, I never got the hate for Hayden's acting growing up. now with a new director he will be able to show how good he is
Hayden watched Clone Wars and study the character. I'm amazed by the dedication and his humbleness by worrying about his performance. Unlike one particular series recently,  about popular Sci-Fi FPS game that are made by people who never played that game.
Hot crowd ! I love it 🔥
How are Ewan and Hayden still so hot?
Hayden has barely aged. Handsome man.
My childhood is alive again. These two actors are the pinnacle of it! T minus 45 minutes now for me and I can’t be more excited to see these two in live action again. Like Hayden said, “This is where the fun begins!”
I want to see an interviewer bring up the fact that Hayden had to deal with at times a very hateful group of fans that were very vocal along with critics and what it took mentally to come back to something that could've been such a negative force in his life
God i hope this show is good, for Hayden's sake, he deserves a win.
I can't speak for others, but I know that I never questioned, doubted or thought negatively of Hayden or his acting in the prequels or his acting overall. He is FOREVER Anakin Skywalker!!
Happy to see these guys back
It’s so awesome to see Hayden!!! Love him!!!
I love seeing Filoni and Favreau slipping in Star Wars Legends characters like Thrawn while the Dark One tries everything to destroy the Lucas Influence on Star Wars. Like she tried with the Failed Sequel.
Can this dude start acting more again? He looks like such a star , now more than ever
Who are those all grown men with beards who’s yelling like kids there? Don’t they have work?
Watching at 12 lol
Interview would’ve been better without the crowd. But I’ll take it.
This was already an emotional experience for me seeing my childhood back as a now adult, but when he said “this is where the fun begins”, my childhood flashed before my eyes, almost brought me to tears. God bless them both
The, you were brothers quip was perfect timing.
I’m so ready for this series they are going to be great
Brings a smile to my face  Accidentally paused at 1:51 and legitimately looks like Obi and Anakin are taking questions about their war stories
they haven't aged a day
Welcome back, gentlemen.
"This is where the fun begins" *mic drop*...Hayden was cold! I love both Ewan and Hayden as a kid...and even as an adult..can not believe we're hours away and about to witness the gap-close on a tremendous story arc that has culminated in 45 years...that is so iconic and influential on the culture...we've been ready
Hayden hasn’t aged at all
I kinda like the fact that they waited years before making this. If you had to live knowing that your best friend completely turned and you had to fight him to the bitter end, that would weigh on your mind incredibly. With that being said, Ewan still looks like he's barely aged though lmao
MY BODY IS READY FOR THE BAIT AND SWITCH!!!! 👁️👄👁️🌬️🦶🤖🐂🤤😇🤠🐴🤦‍♂️😍🤷‍♂️😁🤔🍬☠️😂👑💯
2:37 Nice lightsaber trick, guy in the background.
HE SAID THR FUNNY THING
Its so weird to hear Ewan's real accent
This is honeslty the hypest I've been for some new Star Wars in a while. Please don't fumble the bag on the OB1K show. PLEASE!
So hype
9:19 my poor little heart, I can't 😭😭😭😭
peace and love to u all, so hype lol
That is the most respectfully disrespectful way to possibly introduce Ewan
I love Ewan. But Hayden, man. The most underrated actor in the history of hollywood. So hyped!!!!! Never have been so hyped for a show. Watch 'Shattered Glass' to see how exceptional of an actor he really is.
2:38
He said the thing!
Just commenting so I remember this in 5 years
He said the line . Had me going crazy
This crowd is really annoying
Another happy landing
Hayden still looks young
This is where the fun begins 🐐
This is where the fun begins.
Makes me feel like a giddy child again. Episode 3 will always have a special place in my heart as the first Star Wars movie I fell in love with. Hayden was always my favorite and I always wished I had his signature mullet! I have no expectation for this show other than the fact that these two will be in it, and that is enough for me to be ecstatic!
LOL This guy did Ewan dirty with that intro but Ewan was a champ about it.
I like how Ewan is in brown and white like a jedi and Hayden is in all black like a sith.
I swear hayden has been looking younger and younger each interview 😂 it’s like all the love is rejuvenating him
Hayden Christensen didn't just do it for himself and the fans, not just for the men either... but for the women... and for the children too!
ITS SO AMAZING TO SEE THESE TWO AGAIN ESPECIALLY ANI ! I grew up with them two ! They where so under rated at the time I didn’t even know the critics where been harsh to them , but to me and my friend Revenge of the sith was such an iconic movie!
So so happy seeing them back 😭
Honestly seeing both Ewan and Hayden together again makes me so happy! These two made our childhoods amazing! <3
2:49 Obi-Wan Kenobi Obi-Wan Kenobi, Obi-Wan Kenobi
I brought back the mullet like 5 years ago...
God it's good to see Hayden back and shown how much he means to all of us
can we get a jumper 2 now please
I wanted to hear them talk, but I can't take the audience.
Happy to hear Ewen gets the love he deserved for the prequels.
It’s so nice that us kids who grew up with the prequels are now adults and can finally give Hayden all the love he deserved 20 years ago. The prequels defined a huge part of mine and my brothers childhoods. It’s so amazing we now get these two back!
It's really nice seeing Hayden get so much love from the fans after how badly he was treated for years.
I literally cried 😭❤
This is where the fun begins.
9:40 HE TRULY IS THE CHOSEN ONE 🙌🏽💯🔥🔥🔥
that guy in the backround was just flicking his lightsaber around 2:38
The Prequels had a good overall story, they had some bad direction/dialogue, but the overall story was still fun.
Obi Wan and Stranger Things s4,my Friday night is gonna be great!
So many moments where I couldn't control my smile. So great seeing them together.
The fact the first words out his mouth werent "hello there" was a missed opportunity. Still excited
"Fun isn't something one considers when watching a pre show but this does put a smile on my face"
I like how theyre even dressed in their respective colours, Ewan in obiwans white and brown jedi attire and Hayden wearing black like Vader’s armour.
I loved Hayden as Anakin before it was cool
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.
Watching Hayden smile and soaking up those Hayden chants actually brought tears to my eyes. I wish we could have been the vocal majority when we were kids instead of those so called “critics”. He would have felt that love a long, long time ago
So happy for Hayden, being welcomed back so lovingly. Hopefully this opens the door for other prequel actors to return and maybe the sequels actors too.
"A guy who's uncle was in a new hope" XD dude that's hilarious
I just noticed what there wearing resembles there colors they wear in ep 3
I'm grateful for what I can get.....but ONLY 6 episodes of my most nostalgic childhood comebacks?? I believe a petition should be on the table for a season 2!
" He was a Good Friend" ....Obi Wan
I actually thought that was bryan cranston and James Franco.
Hayden needs this boost in his career. He's done a few other projects, but what he was mostly doing was dividing his time between his farm in his native Canada and doing the Comic Con circuit. He and Ian McDermand came to the convention here in Utah and both actually spent some time at the children's hospital before coming to the convention center.
Whatever happens with the show good or bad I’m glad these two got this moment with the fans, lord knows it’s long overdue for them
Their outfits are Obi Wan & Darth Vader colored.
Surprised no one noticed that their outfits are colour graded to their characters. Cool touch
Hyped for the Kenobi series
Its funny that Hayden's normal voice sounds more like Clone Wars Anakin than Movie Anakin
That lightsaber flip from the guy I’m the background at 2:35 was sick.
Hayden just oozes charisma, I'm so glad to see him reprise his role. He deserves all the attention that will come to him from this series, we need to see more of him
People who think Hayden butchered Anakin don't realize that he did it exactly the way he was supposed to, spoke with proper cadence, and had the proper adaptation of the Chosen One
I'm so happy to see Ewan and Hayden looking so happy and healthy here. A long overdue return but a welcome one to be sure!
I love that actors like Hayden are making peace with the characters they have been, like Andrew Garfield with Spiderman and Hayden Christensen with Anakin Skywalker, It must be shoking recive so much love from the people after all the hate, but finally they have the fans they always deserved.
Seeing Hayden get this much love is great
most amazing fanbase, ewan and hayden are so humble, they deserve it all
Security feeling like Imperial Guards when the music hit at the end.
i love them both AF. like a lot. but i am really happy for Hayden specially. idk why. i am happy for his career! <3
Such an iconic duo! 😁
It seems. They both have the high ground now
"This is where the fun begins" was so scripted.
Only a certain type of dude can rock white pants.
that introduction physically hurt my brain  im going into OR on tuesday
Absolute legends
Didn’t realize ewan mcgregor was so irish
Happiest. Moment. Of my life.
My childhood 🥲
02:37 we just gonna ignore the dude in the back spinning the lightsaber ? 😂
Ngl, the guy in the background has sick moves,. 2:37
This is where the fun begins!
Notice how they’re wearing the same colors as their characters. Anakin, Black. Kenobi, Brown.
The 🐐 s of the Star Wars saga
4:28   Hayden be like: *sweating bullets*   Meanwhile everyone chanting: *ANAKIN, ANAKIN, ANAKIN!!!!*   Gosh i loved it, and i am happy he is returning!
Chills fr
I am gonna cry when i see Vader!!!!!!
Leyendas 😎
I hope the show is really good, saw the andor trailer and starwars just moved into a great direction.
27 years later "this is where the fun begins 💙
This warms my heart so much the child in me is screaming cause I’m one of thos fans who grew up with the prequels and so happy to have them back
I absolutely love the way they are dressed. Just like their characters 😁😁😁😁
My childhood memories are back ahahha
They are star wars !
This needs more views XD like now!
Man, seeing these guys together 20 years later is surreal. Beautiful
I love the coordination of their wardrobes
Finally, Hayden is getting the love he deserves. It took way too long. I'm so, so glad he didn't end up bitter/jaded because of the hatred he received back then; it would have been understandable if he had, but he's so chill and still so passionate about Star Wars and it paid off. The fans who hated on the prequels are getting way more than they deserve now as far as I'm concerned.
🔥😭❤
This makes me so happy seeing those two together again!
I only hear the cumtown lyrics when that song plays
9:40 I GOT CHILLS. HAYDEN WE LOVE YOU.
The Legends 😍
Que lindo que hayden y ewan ocupen los colores de sus respectivos papeles en sus outfits. Ewan de matices café y hayden de negro. Genial
that last line 🥰
Star Wars Celebration Live!
The audience is annoying, litteraly half the video is people screaming
THE MEN THE MYTHS THE LEGENDS!!!!!!!!
hello Star Wars Universe my name is JOHN CENA!!!!
They’re the Lennon/McCartney of Star Wars
This is where the fun begins, and The crowd goes wild
Seeing Hayden back is bloody brilliant!
So glad people are showing the love for Hayden.
I love these two so much
Loved every moment of this!!!
How is ewen 51?!
I always have, and always will LOVE Hayden's/Anakin's SIMPLE LOGIC! Now if you don't mind, we have some fun to begin!!!
*DUEL OF THE FATES* on their Entrance is just 🔥🔥🔥🔥
🙏🙏🙏
That was so dope. Seeing Hayden get his props was goosebumping
Bro I need that beskar coffee table
Oh my God . This is happening.
when he said the iconic line "This is where the fun begins" it actually felt that my childhood flashed before my eyes. Anakin is my favorite character and it blew my mind as a kid to see him become Darth Vader.
These 2 were so much apart of my childhood. So awesome.
I was a year old when New Hope came out and Star Wars raised me. The very first movie I EVER saw in the theater was Empire with my dad. Then I had to wait for New Hope to come out on HBO. My dad recorded it on VHS and I literally watched it every Sunday when my parents were getting ready for church. I went opening night for Jedi and it’s been a great journey. I think it’s cool we’ll get to tie together the prequels and the originals.
anyone else notice their outfits match the colour scheme of their episode 3 robes
i’ve watched revenge of the sith 12 times at cinema when i was 13 yo😂 i love them
Looks like Hayden and Ewan have such a good relationship. Nice to see them enjoying the fandom and the Star Wars itself!
Loved every second of this interview.  So happy for Hayden.  Fans so ugly after the Prequels.  But now, he is getting so much love and he DESERVES ALL OF IT!!!!!
I miss when SW was great.  When you have to encourage them to keep making noise, you're a failure. 3:58....nevermind. Even the editing department can't get the characters right. He played Kenobi? Hahaha.
Star Wars fan truly do not deserve Hayden… he’s too good for all you heathens
That cheer when he said that's when the fun begins 🤣
You guys remember that SpongeBob episode where he sticks his hand out and everyone cheers? In the best way possible, that's exactly what this video is like
Looking at them both is like seeing old friends back. The feeling was just like I saw Luke in The Mandalorian
I love how Ewan is wearing a brown jacket to symbolize his Jedi robes and Hayden is wearing all black.
I am so proud of them, just a grown man crying at home on my couch and beaming with happiness.
Ewan… still hot, maybe even hotter now! Yummy.
YESSSS!!!!!!!
it’s christmas man love them
The comic versions was better
they're wearing the same colour palette as their on-screen costumes <3
❤️
I'm so glad Hayden is participating in a lot more Star Wars events now, always loved him as Anakin (who is my personal favorite film character).
I can't stop smiling, I absolutely teared up seeing the most recent preview.
Weird crowd
These guys are like the Beatles of Star Wars.
IM LITERALLY CRYING
Harden has aged well bless him Ewan is ewan
Honestly the beginning was so hilarious with Ewan just pointing and people screaming like crazy
Ewan walked out looking like a modern day version of Obi-Wan, his apparel matching those jedi robes 😂
Chicken Andy returns!
Could anyone make out what the audience was saying? The only one I got was the one about them being brothers.
Hayden looked like he was getting choked up. Man this is gonna be awesome
Holly far far away, I really was inspecting H.C. would have say his unique lines💙😱😱😱♥️
i hate when people are screaming in the crowd trying to get a reaction while Ewan or Hayden are trying to answer questions its so annoying
Hell yeah!!!!
yes hayden we miss you too
❤️
Am I the only one who saw that guy at the back in minute 2:36? The force is is strong in this one
Where is he getting 20 years from ROTS was released in 2005?
9:40 Hayden said it! He said the thing!
These dudes have good chemistry, they should make a TV show or something.
This is legendary 😭😭
I hope that one day, Jake Loyd gets this level of outpouring of love.
Darth Vader, the only Villain who is loved more than the Jedi.
Even down to the clothes for the interview. Brown for Ewan and black for Hayden.
"i missed you guys too." awwwwwww
I'm so excited to see what they do with this series. I wonder just how much of Hayden we'll be seeing. Vader without the mask would be amazing
This is what I have lived my 68 years for!!
Man this is cracked
The Prequel Trilogy will always hold a special place in my heart. From playing with a Bo staff while Attack of the Clones was on the TV to witnessing Revenge of the Sith opening day in the theater, I've been so consistently/incessantly enamored from the story that Hayden/Ewan amongst others depicted. Any film will have its flaws, but these are true passion projects from which you feel every ounce of love and care. I'm HYPED for Kenobi!!
"I missed you guys too" 😭😭😭
Give them their roses.
I hope the writers give Hayden something to work with. I want to see him walk away from this happy and with the full embrace of the fans. I was young when TPM released and was only bummed because I had always pictured Anakin differently, nothing to do with the actors. I was a fan of the prequels this whole time, even putting ROTS at my favorite of the franchise.
I love how they are wearing their character colors.
Hearing Hayden embrace the fan community with that final line and seeing them cheer made me grin from ear to ear. So glad he’s back!
I wonder where Hayden's career goes from here. I know he wasn't in exile or anything but he's had a relatively low profile compared to his costars and I'd say his charm has doubled with age. He can still be a star and not just in Star Wars.
Haydens hair is much better than the other look. Love it.
Hayden saying "I missed you guys too" made me want to cry😭
ewan dripped out in tom ford
Ewan had the high ground for half a second
Star Wars Celebration (Day 1) has been a spectacular success. It was an absolute joy spending time with fans, cast members, creators, friends and of course... THE BROTHERS!!!   (Also, it's wonderful to see the comment section giving proper (and very much deserved) LOVE FOR HAYDEN. 💯👍)  Global KENOBI watch party tonight. I do hope you all enjoy -- and from wherever you are in the Galaxy..  MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.
HAYDEN AND EWAN AGAIN 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🫡🫡🫡🫡
God I hope this series is a banger. The fans really want it and after seeing the reaction of the crowd both of those guys deserve it too
What stage was this on
2:23 It’s not Ewan McGregor. It’s Catcher Block! 😂😂😂
It's a bromance
I do not understand why Hayden received criticism. I LOVED that he was Anakin.
I can only imagine how this feels for them.   To have the prequels hated for so long, and then more than 20 years later they can finally come back and have a huge crowd of people cheering for them. Especially Hayden, he got so much hate for his portrayal of Anakin, I'm glad he's finally getting the love and recognition he deserves
Half the video is just cheering😂😂😂
This is where the fun begins! 😎🙈😈
2:37 Guy flexing his lightsaber
As a fan, believe me when i say i understand the fans excitement for these events, but for the love of God you're there to hear them speak and to let them speak. I just don't get that personally. Cheer for them, but settle down and know the cues when to stop lol.
*They’re getting the standing ovation for like 8 minutes long because they’re legends*
Even though I grew up on the original Star Wars, these two I feel are MY Star Wars Heroes and Legends.
God I hope this doesn’t flop
Hayden watching The Clone Wars and Rebels is exactly the right thing to do, learn more about the charter he played, his adventure, relashonships with other characters, I wonder if Ewan did too
I swear the interviewer just asked questions that have been asked hundreds of times these last weeks😂
Finally hayden gets the recognition he always deserved 🥹
Hayden has the episode 3 hair 🥺🥺
Can the crowd just shut up
It's truly a wonderful sight to see Hayden get so much love now.
Omggg let them talk for a min I mean I get the hype but this clip was all cheers
"This is where the fun begins" , the entire building falls down
POV: we all loved this
Ahhhhhhhh
I have a serious question. Does Hayden's last words relate to any lines in the movie? I'm curious.
Hayden looks like Marlon Brando! :D
My lord vader
#GiveUs1313
Two of my favorite actors, not just Star Wars wise, but cinema wise. Growing up with the prequels, Ewan and Hayden were who I sympathize the most with. To the my brother and I compared each other appropriately, as I was younger Anakin was ideal as he was Obi-Wan.  Ewan and Hayden, I'm so happy to see you guys back together once more for the new Disney+ show that'll air tomorrow. May the Force be with you two!
Ngl I’m a huge star wars fan but man these people should let them talk. Hayden looked specially stressed not being able to listen to the questions and people interrupting them while they were talking
I was expecting Ewan would said Hello there after he came out.
OMG HE DID NOT JUST SAY "This is were the fun begins." AHHHH IM FAN BOYING OUT RN
Is it me or is Ewan tearing up talking about the fan love now ❤️
AWESOME
HE SAID IT, HE SAID THE THING!!
I never had an issue with the  prequel movies, they had clone wars to fill gaps, it was great.  Really hope this is amazing.  Disney's take has been rather disappointing.
This series better be good man, this interview got me hyped!  This is where the fun begins 😎  P.S. the interviewer did a great job
utter chills having them walk out on stage
This interview was 50mins to short!!
I love how they dress almost cosplay like
Bet 💯
The raw Energy. The Tension. The Build Up. The hype. The Impact. The Importance. The force behind this show is unlike anything I have seen in quite a while. I'm ready, while at the same time... I'm not ready.... #ObiWanKenobi
I love how Ewan is wearing obi wans colours and Hayden is wearing Vader's, nice touch.
I like how actors chose the colors for their clothes to match their Star Wars characters. Example Obi-Wan’s attire are brown, light brown, tan and white.  Vader attire is all black.
wouldve been awesomenif the officer was dressed up as a stormtrooper
2:36 that dude with the red blade in the background *knew* the camera was aimed at him 😂
Intresting Haden is speaking in a lower tone, his Jedi/'Vader character. its so interesting seeing him so in character the whole time. if you watch other video of his speaking about other projects he usually has a much softer tone. but for the fans. he loves us. he loves how magical his roal as the chosen one is. how magical it is for all of us.
These two are my Star Wars. My childhood heroes. I can't express how happy I am to see them again.
I am so happy to see Hayden and EWAN get the credit and support they deserve! They were amazing in the prequels, and didn’t deserve the hate… It’s awesome that they can finally see how much WE love and support them!
9:27 this now officially lives in my head rent free
Seeing such a huge turnaround for Hayden is so heartwarming to me. I’m really glad that he’s getting the treatment he should have been getting from the start
This was amazing. So so could to see Hayden and Ewan finally soaking up the love from the fans.
"This is were the fun begins"
I LOVEEEE THAT THEY GET TO EXPERIENCE ALL OF THIS LOVE
i hope this show is great and gets great feedback and the both of them get many more offers from disney from here on so they can both continue to do great in many more shows and movies from here on , i hope this isnt just one thing they do i would hate it if i dont see these two more often from here on out
Dont disrespect Obi wuan like that if it wasnt for him we wouldnt have vader
I wish the crowd would just shut up at times
They even dressed according to their jedi robes
I love how Hayden has got nothing but love for coming back.
I was over by the photo ops waiting when they came out, and I couldn't stop smiling the whole time they were on stage!  Absolutely fantastic!  Thank you to the powers that be for getting them together.
Been wanting this for a long time from Star Wars, only thing that'd make Vaders presence better would be for his story to continue with Star Killer after Obi-Wan
The fan reaction when they walked in made me so happy. They are both so deserving.
Dudes walked up as if Sith Lords were their speciality.
2:37 this was freakin' cool, but no one gonna talk about how the guy in the back made such a badass movement with his lightsaber?
This is were the fun begins
KK did not make this Lucas did and she can't make anything good on her own..but she bait and switch it to make  them two to look weak and bad
Where do ppl buy those lightsabers  They don’t look like the heavy ones
Man I don’t like to watch them keep getting interrupted let them finish their thought bro I’m excited too
So jealous I'm not there. 😭
3:57 "Hayden Christianson - Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi".   You literally had one job. At Star Wars celebration, you can't even write who he plays correctly.
Its good to see the lads back,  i didnt know what that other guy was yapping about
Now all they have to do is bring back Mace Windu! Sam's been calling for ir for years!
Quai Gon-The force is strong with this one that much is clear
12m this will be when the fun begins
Haydens last words, that was the best line he could’ve said “this is where the fun begins”
I'm so glad Hayden still attended Star Wars Celebration.
They're wearing color-matched outfits!!!
The part where Hayden says "this is where fun begins" then people bursting into cheers is literally the meme where the audience is watching on a giant screen
I love how many interviews they're doing for this. Just love hearing them both talk
Glad that female inquisitor isn’t on there yet again. She seems to pop up everywhere
Those guys that cheers are mostly the one that appreciate your portrayals of character in our generation of Star Wars movie, we don't care what the critics says we don't care what the older 'fans' says....we always love Ewan and Hayden in Star Wars, and we do wait for the time when both of them comeback again this Friday 🥰
Epic when he says “This is where the fun begins.” And the crowd gets hyped 🙌🏽🙌🏽
This is what they deserved all along. These guys are great.
I'd definitely be holding up my red light saber if I was there!
HAYDEN CHANT!!!!
I love the prequels! I grew up with them
9:27
I love how they both just look so nonplussed lol
CHILLSS
I would love to see a limited Vader series that takes place shortly after ROTS. Anything with Hayden Christensen and Ian McDiarmid working together would be awesome. And, seeing Vader hunt down hidden Jedi would be awesome. The possibilities would be endless.
9:40 made me so hype
The hype for this show is for freaking real! Can’t wait till this drops tomorrow!
SO excited for this!!!! Watching Revenge of the sith right now!!
Hayden saying "Dave Filoni" is such a validating moment. Also...I'm being nostalgic surely, but...does anybody else think he *sounds* like Matt Lanter's Anakin?
The energy there was nuts!! So happy seeing the fandom sending so much love to them, specially to Hayden.
the two brothers reunited, we have nothing but love to give Ewan and Hayden
9:40
Let’s goooooo
Every time I get mad at the toxic geek incel fan base I remember that THESE people are the fans that will keep them going and keep good artists coming back to the franchise
honestly a tear is coming to my eye seeing this love for Hayden. He deserves this. He deserves this.
God they both look fantastic…
Really glad hayden is getting the love he deserves
Those poor guys. What a rude crowd.
"Because she directed all of the episodes, it has her singular vision throughout." I feel like that's a shot at the Sequel Trilogy. Maybe I'm just grasping at straws. I don't know. Can't wait for tomorrow. "This is where the fun begins." Loved hearing that and it gets me even more pumped for the show.
Hayden looks surprised by all of the love....Welcome back.
Boy both of them must be ultra tired from doing all the promotional interview and then doing this one. Omega props for both of them for doing this for the fans.
Ah Star Wars fans, forever trending with popular comment sections. Seen thousands of you repeating that “I hate sand” line and roasting Hayden as Anakin. I don’t think people even have opinions anymore, they just read what’s popular and go with it lol.
Hayden and Ewan made Revenge of the Sith my favourite SW movie. Seeing then return makes me so indescribably happy. Hopefully this series turns out to be epic like RotS
I love their outfits, it matches their characters robes.
Wooooo !!
Admit it. We all got excited as he said that line. Can't waiiiiiiittttttttttt
I loved the prequels
No matter the hate, Hayden will always be Anakin/Vader
I was nine years old when I saw them together for the last time. Today I am 25 and I am infinitely grateful for all the happiness they have given me with this great story.
...
Ewan looks so confident and Hayden seems shy.
I grew up watching both of you in the prequel. I love the sword fight and I love the clone wars period. So happy to see both of you reunion again and I hope it will be more in the future!!
I wanted a "hello there" so bad
I CAN'T WATCH THIS YET, I'M NOT READY!! 😭
While I love the energy that surrounds them, and how excited the fans are, I can't help but be extremely annoyed on behalf of the two of them whenever people would interrupt them in the middle of answering a question lol
Letssss gooooooooo!!!! So ready!!!!!!!
2:36 dude in the back is an actual sith lord
definitely tho "THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS" truly this is the words of an icon .
2:37 That dude with the crimson blade is smooth.
I'm thrilled that Lucasfilm is considering more seasons of Kenobi--more opportunities for us to see Ewan and Hayden, and to hear Obi-Wan's somber but beautifully hopeful leitmotif through the Star Wars years onscreen.
2 minutes in and this host is so annoying that I don't know if I can make it the rest of the way
9:31 What. A. Moment. Hayden deserves all this love
El Hype esta demasiado alto! A tan solo horas de lo que por mucho hemos esperado, Annie y El Viejo Kenobi estan de regreso 😎
At the time the prequels came out, it was all the voices of the Original trilogy fans who were bashing it. Now that all the kids that loved the prequels have grow , Hayden is finally getting the love he deserves!
Man, so glad to see the fandom embrace Hayden in such a heartwarming way.
Yesssss tonight
I don’t care what people say, I will always love Haden as anakin/vader
Hayden is so sincere!!
Hayden and Ewan are two great actors. Watching the two of them act in Star Wars shows that the two of them are just too cool and classy. Hayden and Ewan always receive much deserved love from fans. I will always support Hayden and Ewan ❤️
Look how far we as a fan base have come, from such unnecessary hatred to overwhelming love, we’ve still got some work to do in other aspects of the franchise, the sequels primarily (not the biggest fan of them myself but there’s no need to be a massive hater, especially towards the actors, they don’t deserve that), but this is a massive victory for us, I can’t wait to watch this show, like Hayden said, this is where the fun begins!
You can really see the love the fans have for Hayden. So amazing to have my favorite character back
Idk why but I was so pumped to hear Hayden say that at the end. It was truly the perfect response
hello there
Anyone notice Their clothing color schemes...
And of course at the end they had to play Duel of the Fates. As if we weren't emotional enough already.
Oh this is lovely I am so so so happy
10:04 That voice crack though 😂
I don’t care If it’s good or bad, I’m gonna love it no matter what.
LEGENDARY
I always liked the prequels, never understood the hate 🤷‍♂️ Glad to see these guys back!
THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS
Does Hayden not age? He literally looks like he’s still 20.
Those two are ageless
I am so very happy that my two favorite characters are coming back to Star Wars I am so very happy thank you
✨🤟
I love the Hayden chant he needed that!
I won't say cause of spoilers, but I heard ending got leaked and people are upset
La wea hermosa, voy a llorar.
❤🖤❤🖤❤
HE SAID IT HE SAID IT HE SAID IT !!!!!!!!!  9:39
9:40 Couldn't have said it better
I noticed Hayden's voice has gotten deeper and sounds more like Clone Wars TV show Anakin
Excellent 💕
Haven't been this hyped on star wars since Luke in Mando season 2, I hope Hayden is here to stay
Those 2 deserve this. SO MUCH.
Few more hours!
I love that Ewan has the brown coat with the white pants and Hayden is dressed in all black kinda represents their characters :)
This is so cool. I can't believe this is actually happening. Like this is actually happening, and the first episodes come out in just a few hours. This is the greatest thing since Revenge of the Sith.
Hayden deserves everything! I’m so glad he’s getting the love he deserves
Hayden is actually sweating through that suit…..wow…..
I am so happy to see them together after so much time, and even more to see that they are getting sooo much love from the community, its just phenomenal...
phantom menace, am I a joke to you?
this brought tears to my eyes, this is really hyping me up for tomorrow.
Something tells me that after this, Hayden will be getting his own Vader series to compliment this.
Almost 5 hours to go! :D
Hayden looks like he just stepped off the set of episode 3
Have to admit, this is amazing to see. Just a beautiful moment in tough times.
It makes me so happy seeing Hayden getting to do this and experience this! So deserved
I hate sand.
Even their outfits match their characters. Kenobi with brown and white, Vader with all black.
I loathe the fact that this series is gonna be a "bait & switch" WOKE POS!! 🙄🤦🏼‍♂️ In which I won't partake in....ya'll need to WAKE UP!!
This is where the fun begins
gutted he didn't ask hayden to take a seat at the start of the interview
This is where the fun begins, that almost brought me to tears.
I missed u guys to I like all the cheering for him our favorite characters are back wish I could meet them and tell them how much I appreciate them
Amazing how nostalgia and time can redeem things. Not long ago nobody would've given the time of day to Christensen. I guess it was "in" to complain about him back then. Now they have another target.
GREAT interview! Amazing to see Ewan and Heydan having so much fun and feeling the love from the fans.
I’ve never seen such an energetic crowd!
Gosh this is amazing I’m so glad seeing them get all this love that they deserve.
Fire KK and her coven and rehire GC
It's beautiful. I've looked at this for five hours now.
These guys are troopers for answering all the same questions over and over in a million interviews.
Buddy at 2:37 with the siq saber toss, well done!!!!
Man I’m so happy for Hayden. He’s getting the treatment he probably thought he would never receive from the fans, and you can see how much he truly loves Star Wars
So great to see Hayden Christensen back on the screen and getting the love he deserves as well as Ewan McGregor. Can't wait to see the show tonight!!!
I remember the flack Hayden received for his monotone acting  in ep 2-3 . Really glad the fans have taken a liking to him over time and saw that he did in fact incarnate a worthy Anakin .
9:42 Every Starwars fan when it hits MIDNIGHT on May 27th, 2022!!!
Ewan coming out with a Jedi suit and Hayden with a Sith Lord Suit 😂
This made my day
Ewan Mcgregor -Obi-Wan Kenobi, Obi-Wan Kenobi
Hayden knew what he was doing. "This is where the fun begins." The crowd's reaction reminded me of that meme with the cheering people and the big screen...same energy.
I cant wait!!!!!
HE SAID THE LINE LETS GOOOOOOO
LET’S GOOO!!!! 😍😍I’m counting down the hours till Kenobi!
Seriously, I don't think Christensen wanted to play Darth Vader again. I guess his return was just for the money. He suffered a lot from the criticism to his trilogy.
That is an AMAZING track to walk out to!
I was holding back tears when he said the line at the end
9:39 🙌👏👏👏
9:39 is so wholesome (:
I like how they both are dressed in the colour schemes of their movie outfits, but in normal clothes. Don't know if they did that intentionally or not, haha.
That was genuinely sweet to see how much the fans have embraced Hayden and Ewan and how those two really seem to care, Hayden seems really chill. They deserve it. 😭🤧
Hayden didn't deserve the trash that the trash fans threw at him for the prequels. I used to laugh at those fan boys
Esto era lo unico que estaba esperando durante la trasmisión
makes me happy, makes me smile
Daddies 🔥
They should bring in Jake Loyd. Boy kid went through hell.
Hayden is star wars for me!
It's like watching the freaking Mickey mouse show....
Its good to have him back in Star Wars
Love these guys.
I love both of them !
"The crowds are going nuts!!!"
I'm like a kid in a candy store! I'm the same age as these guys, and FN hell do I wish I was in their shoes. What a ride it must be to get to inhabit these characters! The man everyone wishes they could be, and the man everyone fears they could become! 👏 Congrats to both of them! Im very excited for this!
So glad these two are having this moment! Watching the prequels now!
I am so happy that Ewan and Hayden are receiving all the love and respect their works for the prequels, especially Hayden!!!
That Hayden chant actually brought a tear to my eye he deserves this more than you could ever know
Now I‘m gonna get really disappointed if the show doesn‘t live up to its hype. Please let this be like Elden Ring D:
This is so surreal. I love these guys and I can't wait to watch Kenobi.
WE NEED A VADER SERIES
This is where the fun begins
Hayden is actually starting to sound like his Clone Wars counterpart, Matt Lanter. While that's age making his voice deeper, I think it fits perfectly for Anakin.
It warms my heart beyond words to see these men return and get the celebration and stunning reaction they've deserved from the beginning.
9:40 your welcome
Best quote of the interview: “This is where the fun begins!!”
So good to see Hayden again!
Obi wan and Vader
I grew up watching the prequels first, so from my point of view, I've always loved Anakin as a character much more than Luke; now Luke is still great and what not, but for me, Anakin / Darth Vader will always be the true protagonist of Star Wars; so thank you Hayden Christensen, I know you may not have felt it at the time, but I know that there are many just like me who loved your portrayal and movies, there just werent any avenues at the time for us to share our love.
I CAN'T STOP CRYING TEARS OF JOY! HELP ME!!!!!
Também sou fã dos filmes "Star Wars", aqui no Brasil! Que a força esteja com todos vocês! "Eu sou seu pai!" Umas das cenas memoráveis! Outra cena memorável, é quando Luke salta, pendurado, abraçado com a Princesa Léia, ao fundo o som da música da saga! Quem é fã como eu, irá se lembrar!
Legendary Mic Drop
Never thought I’d see the boys together again 🥺
HELLO THERE
I LOVE THEM! The best thing to happen to Star Wars since George Lucas sold the company. Let’s go!!!! ❤️
My band produced a Star Wars punk-rock song in Chicago that is a spin on "The Empire Strikes Back". Please click on our sleeping tiger icon to possibly give it a listen. It is called "Lightsaber Language"..
1000th Like 👍
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! This is where the fun begins!!! NGL I’m in tears seeing these two back and getting the respect they deserve but it’s happy tears 🥲
I've a good feeling about this
Hayden is one of the nicest guys I’ve ever seen
THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS! 😍😍
Thanks for doing this for use!! Hayden 🎉
I can’t wait for the watch party!
This is where the fun begins!!!!! Yesss!!
Love these guys
I have no idea why the building didn't explode after Ewan's "Hello There" and Hayden's "This is where the fun begins "!!!!!!!! The force is strong with this one
Who else was excited to see Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen at Celebration together? It was very emotional and more so being hours away from seeing the first 2 chapters of the Obi Wan series.
I was so excited for the series! As a big fan of Star Wars, especially is the prequels, I'm so happy when Ewan and Hayden came back. I have become the 5 years old kid when i saw 2 of them again. Omg, so excited
Imagine obiwan saying 'i don't like sand' in Kenobi series
"Interviews in history that make you smile"
9:13 Seeing how emotional Hayden got just made me so emotional! 9:40 Is so iconic!
I'M LITERALLY COUNTING THE HOURS!! Omg I can’t wait 😩😩😩❤️
I always loved Episode I through III as much as the old ones. I never understood it when others complained about it. I love Ewan and Hayden
at 2:37 out of nowhere somebody just casually flips a lightsaber so perfectly
So epic to hear that Hayden watched the Star Wars universe before entering the series!!!
There should be a Star Wars Gonk droid story about a Gonk droid
Love that the audience just kept cheering.
5:36 what did that guy yell out I cant tell what he says
I am willing to bet anyone 100 dollars that Obi-Wan will say Hello There in Episode 1
Gonk
Oh my goodness, the smile on Hayden’s face when the crowd was cheering after being asked how hype they were! I’m so glad he’s finally being welcomed and given the love he has always deserved from fans!
Been a fan of Hayden since day 1 in 2002 still remember the yogurt smell from being thrown in the trash for saying that. So happy for you getting the respect and love Hayden
So much hype
Anthony Carboni‽ I haven't seen him hosting anything in quite some time. A welcomed face and voice, happy to see him again.
The guy in the background at 2:37 with the red lightsaber trick, that was dope. 😂
Hayden after watching clone wars and rebels“and now I’m a fan now too” . IN-CREDIBLE 🥺🤩
*FUN FACT*  Ewan McGregor's  chair slightly higher than Hayden's during this interview. Obiwan ONCE again has the highground once again!! 👀
Anakyn
That Beskar table needs to belong to me
The fans are crazy!🤩  What a moment to see both Hayden & Ewan together, I'm sure that they were also amazed by the fans!
Wish I was there! So good to see these 2 killing it again!
BEYOND THE STAR ⭐️
never have i ever been more proud of my car insurance geico
I loved how at the end of the interview when they are walking to the backstage, Hayden Christian wrap his arms around him as they walk out together, definitely gave me goosebumps and flashbacks of Anakin and Obi-Wan as brothers❤️
I had the biggest smile on my face when he said “this is where the fun begins” it made me so happy
This is awesome🔥I'm glad they're getting so much love after being critized when their movies first came out. My opinion, revenge of the sith is the best star wars movie
What I would give to be there😭😭
Love it so much, great interview they looked so happy and excited. Ewan is an amazing actor but Hayden will always have a especial spot in my heart, he is so cute and polite and the part where everybody started to scream his name was amazing. Can't wait to watch the episodes.
Thanks, Anthony!  Thanks, Ewan!  Thanks, Hayden!  🌌  #ObiWanKenobi  #DisneyPlus  #StarWars
“This is where the fun begins”….. #classic 👍🏾
5:36 “ you were by brother “
And after they take the stage they will take a backseat to that forgettable new character.
❣️❣️👑👑👑💙💙🙏👍💕
“This is where the fun begins” the words of a truly wise man
This IS where the fun begins.
Hayden is adorable
Please please Disney don’t screw this!!!!!!
Ladies and gentlemen, the legends whose names and roles need no introduction! 😀😃🤓😎😁
I can't describe how happy i am for this
My expectations for this show are unreasonably high🤣
Nice🗿
Duuuuuuuude. I’m gonna cry.
Seeing Hayden and Ewan makes me smile as our childhoods are coming in full circle!!
Notice they are dressed in their revenge of the sith colors
THE GOATS RETURN!!!!!😭😭😭😭😭😁😁😁😁😁
No matter how many criticism Hayden got for his acting, I'm so happy that he's wants to return for the role and I love that Ewan is basically being a father figure towards him, making sure that he is safe and happy that the fans are absolutely welcomed by his return
Disney, "Your vision is flawed" my goodness its nice to see the lads though
9:40 this is our thanks for the childhood memories, sorry it took so long for you guys to hear it!!
The hype is real!!!! The energy when Hayden said the line! They know how much they mean to people now and it’s amazing
I’m glad all the fans are welcoming back both Hayden and Ewan
"Don't try it" in good way
It’s his iconic role in the phantom menace rude
