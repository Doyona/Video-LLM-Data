WHO WINS BETWEEN TYSON FURY & OLEKSANDR USYK? 🤔🔥
Ah, the insufferable Andy Goldstein and ex-footballer Darren Bent....boxing experts.
They have been talking for a year that's absolutely bullshit this guy is a clown people talk about EH but this guy is worse.
I'll believe it when i see them touch gloves in the ring
He "beat the best"... Resume is shocking compared to Lennox. If you look at all the other top HW fighter since Tyson started and got his first belts that he faced, its shocking. So many other belt holders or challengers he never faced or hasn't faced still now. He for me and non Fury arse lickers wont be in the top 5 best ever based on current legacy and CV. If he beats Usyk and AJ and maybe even Zhang hes the best of his era without question. Personally to be seen as the best of an era, you have to beat all in that era.
Bollox
8:46 warren talks bout doubters if u see any fan around the world no 1 hass ever doubted furies ability its jus we as fans want the best to fight the best n he wasting every1 time like who wanted to see him against chisora the outcome was gonna be 1 sided n waste every1 time with ngannou we as fans need better from a world champion especially when u have usyk taking on any1 with the ngannou fight il check wat happened in the fight even tho i no wat happens one sided fury i hope this goes through n we get this fight for boxing its bout time crown undisputed heavyweight champion
Because of your excellency and doctor it’s happening all about the money greed
Frank: It will happen during Riyadh season which is the end of October till March  AG: So it will happen in April?
Bull Shit !!!!! Very doubtful this fight will take place tbh. Tyson running scared and just chasing as much money as he can get by people buying this PPV shite. Fecking disgrace.
This Andy don is quite slow ain’t he?
This whole situation has upset written all over it.... never overlook an opponent (no matter how shit he looks in an open workout) i for one will be putting a little bit on francis by stoppage
Usyk wins
Minute of silence for all you snow flake haters melting right now 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 🔔 🔚 s
Frank: "The fight is on (shoulder rolls). Tyson: "If Usyk wants me then i  want $5 Billion, Australia and Neptune !". John Fury: "I'm a fighting man !!! I'm  calling out King Charles and whoever owns Aldi !!".
Sounds like 💩
UGE!!!!
He must think we were born yesterday!!!
It's funny to hear him trying to list off Tysons achievements 😂,  it's hard to do eh! Fought Kiltchko and that's it 😂, Wilder is terrible, has THE worst record of any heavyweight champ in history, was fighting binmen and shop stackers 😂
Usyk Dubois rematch….  Flogging a dead horse with dumb dumb Dubois and the joggernumpty I’ve seen rocks with more personality and brain power 😂
Fury will be exposed for the fraud he is. It’s what he’s been hiding all along. Fury is a bum!
Call me cynical but i remember when Fury v AJ was announced as agreed but politics got in the way with the Wilder arbitration 😮
If anyone belives frank, good luck. Fury vs fransis is a none title fight. This a publicity stunt? waste your money on pvp! this wont happen.
Fury is afraid of Usyk, if not he would fight him long time ago
Finally! We will see who is the real champion.
I can guarantee you this fight will not happen. Fury knows he   will lose.
I'm a big boxing fan. But I'm feeling uneasy about the situation of misaligned matches.
Usyk gonna walk allover fury
Just a thought but does this meant that Filip Hrgovic has stepped aside, or that IBF will strip Usyk of their so called "World" title, or that IBF has been paid to demote Hrgovic from next in line for their title? Or is it an as yet unresolved condition precedent that Frank Warren and Greedy Belly regard as nothing to do with them, even though they were largely to blame for the shenanigans and unacceptable delay in getting the fight finalised before?
Dont see this fight happening
Most of the interest in Fury-Ngannou encounter will be from UFC fans. Boxing fans do not care about that farce, just like Youtube fights are watched only by immature brats.
You can tell Ngannou fight is going to be scripted if there are only two months between the two fights.
So Ngannou is now nothing more than a tune-up fight
Just when I thought I was out. They pull me back in
It’s 60/40 by the way
Fury fighting because, the boxing fans starting to realise he is a blagger
Fury will beat Usyk comfortably
I will only start whooping and yelling when they actually climb into the ring for the fight.
Nothing is confirmed and it will not happen due to that effing clown Fury and his pathetic ducking antics.
jump the gun mate fury will be beat he will lose this fight comeing  first  nganno will win tyson to fat and lasy now you will see
It's obviously 70-30 in Fury's favor as it should be so tbh. For some reason I just have a funny feeling about the Ngannou fight. It's one of those things we've seen in boxing or in MMA for so many years. A wrench gets thrown into fate and destiny is fixed.
Look what Tyson did to Wilder - battered him all round the ring. In the first fight Tyson was obviously, rightly, worried about Wilder's big KO punch. After the first fight he learned that he can take whatever Wilder can throw at him and showed it in #2 and #3. Tyson will KO Usyk because Tyson is just too big. Usyk gets battered. It's Tyson's training for Ngannou has fired him up. He's heard Usyk saying he's scared and he's just going to sort Usyk out for good. Tyson knows the best Tyson will mollicate the best Usyk - he just needs to make sure it's the best Tyson that steps into the ring because the judges will favour Usyk - he was protected against Du Bois and Del Boy.
Nobody believes this
Why announce this when clearly nothing is sorted. Wonder how many fights Frank's been on talk sport promised which haven't happened in last 18 months. Fingers crossed this is different but not holding my breath
Doesent want to speak about it because it’s a obscene amount of doe
Gotta say il believe it wen ther both in the ring if it does happen it will b at least 2 fight deal cud even b 3 if it happens loads an loads ov money ther will all make!!!!!!🙌🙏👊👊👍
fighters have signed to fight but no money has been talked about, no date, no venue... makes no sense... how can 2 fighters sign to fight with no money involfed yet hahha.. so they have essentially signed to fight for free at this moment in time...
Utter BS to drive attention to Fury ufc Bloke... how many outs has Frank left himself!
To say it short, I will not believe it at all until they are up in the ring! Fury is all cheap talk and have ran before from fights so until the day they finaly are up in that ring I will believe Fury will run away with some BS excuses or more slander.
Load of bollox wipe ya lip frank. again taking the fans for mugs
If Fury fights like he did with Wilder then he will win. I don't think Usyk could hurt Fury let alone knock him out but i expect he will probably win on points like the AJ fights.
It's an eye roll announcement. A fight is happening. No idea where or when but it's happening.
Believe it when they’re in the ring
Even the best liar in boxing is struggling to make this sound legit.
"It was confirmed that there were rumours...."
So no date, venue, no purse splits but depends on furys outcome, absolute bullshit yet again ffs shut up frank.
Isn’t it sad that although Frank Warren is heard saying that it’s signed, we still have major doubts. Let’s hope it true!
This is the only fight people really want to see.   Two real high IQ boxers and no one trick pony paperweight champions like Anthony Joshua.   Fury vs Usyk.........🥊
Uysk stuck to the 30/70 so it was fury all along but after Uysk last performance fury signed asap 🤡
What a load of crap, why can't he tell us, warran is like hearn, both conmen
I member when aj vs fury was confirmed, it's not confirmed
I DONT REALLY CARE ❤❤❤ DONT LAUGH AT THAT ❤❤❤BECAUSE HE DONT WANT TOO ❤❤❤ BORING. ❤❤I WILL NOT BE WATCHING IT ❤❤❤ DONT CARE
HOW CAN FURY BE THE BEST THE MAN IS LITERALLY BANNED FROM AMERICA 😂😢!.
Jesus Christ , what crap questioning , these two bell's, awful, the digging, the vile way these two rats are talking to frank, asking the same question like four times, darren is such a bore
Alright Dean
Best part of the interview was Frank calling Darren ‘Dean’ at the start.
And now to tall the Hearn lovers who used to call me everything under the sun and a casual for just stating that of course fury is going to usyk he was just gonna will they won’t they for a year and then announce it after his Netflix series has dropped and lo and behold. New my guy wouldn’t let me down and all the while everything frank said last year has happened and he also said matchroom are gonna face the music this year and once again lo and behold Eddie looking more of a scum bag than ever.  THERES ONLY ONE TYSON FURY!!  Thank you frank 🎉  Not replying to the expected matchroom bots and dick riders so fire away.
I'll believe it when they are in the ring. Bricktop has lost it.
On dirait Papacito sur la photo de la vidéo.
To all the fury bum boys there's no fight it's all talk ...
So nothings confirmed.....
7inch reach difference usyk is amazing but that reach against probably the best technical heavyweight ever stopped in 7 hope it does happen tho
People are talking as if the result of the Ngannou fight is a formality, but unless he is under strict instructions not to, he could spoil the party and cost a lot of people a lot of money if he manages to connect with full power on Fury’s chin. The undisputed fight would still happen but Tyson would be less of a draw coming in as the second-stringer who just lost a boxing match to a non-boxer.
They Should Do The Fight For December 30th Right Before New Year's Eve Then Everyone Ends The Year Of With A Bang 🎉🎉 The First Undisputed Heavyweight Champion In 24 Years Since Lennox Lewis
That bloke doesn't listen he was told 4 times it would be in Riyadh season which is September to march
Cue Ngannou sending Fury to the shadow realm and screwing everyones plans loll
If Tyson gets through Ngannou which is most likely this is the fight we really want.
This contract “signing” is literally just to bring more eyes to the Ngannue fight. Just like the Wilder /AJ discussions were only to bring eyes to the Whyte fight. After the fight all of these discussions will fall apart
The PPV will go through the roof if it happens. 😊
Believe it when I see it, show me the contract and money and in the ring and the bell sounds for round one 😊
This is only now because zhang put it on fury and now he's left with no choice either lose on points to usyk or get knocked put by zhang
I will be at the latest time poss  late March
Rubbish.... Cant confirm the obvious? I call bullshit..respectfully
Whatever frank says, question it
Frank Warren is still a prick
This fight should have happened 2 years ago. Usyks almost 40 lol. But yes they’re both close to their primes supposedly
Doesn’t Usyk have mandatories now? Will never happen.
Fury: I’m not interested in usyk he got beat by Dubois anyway his a quitter……. Warren: everybody wants this fight myself , Tyson ….
Tell ya anything to get more pay 4views for next fight 🙄
America - A fight with no date
Won't happen the GypsyQueen's been duckin Usyk forever & will continue to!.. Probably fake a wrist injury 2weeks before the fight!... Stick to Chisora fights Fury thats ye level!..😢😢😢😢
Oh fury is scared huh. He is going to devour usyk.
😴😴😴 past caring to be honest.
All talking like hergovic dont exist with his mandatory
Why the change in heart Tyson?.......is it a 90/10 split 😅😅😅
Here we go again, frank just retire , utter nonsense again.
This is not happening......more promotion for the Ngannou fight,hope it does though.
bound to be a injury
So basically they’ve sorted the money. Because he didn’t wanna speak a split or rematch clause. But said there’s no venue or date. Explains why it hasn’t been made until now and Simon was right with it not being made until the Saudis splash the cash.
Otto Wallin vs Murat Gassiev Tonight!
👍👍👍 Well done Frank.
"Wilder is the hardest puncher of his generation"  Frank, the main selling point for the Francis fight is that he is the hardest puncher?
BULLSHIT 1YEAR TOO LATE WAITING FOR USYK TO SLOW DOWN AT 40YRS OLD WHAT A JOKE, PROB WONT HAPPEN FURY JUST TRYING TO GET HIS BOXING FANS BACK ON BOARD, NOT INTRESTED, FRANK TALKING PURE CRAP
I will bleave it when I see it
Trust me this fight will be called off 💯 Frank ain't selling it and we ain't buying it 😤
No venue.. no purse details... no date...no REAL confirmation... and it depends on what happens in tysons next fight? What bs
Guess he can now claim to be the biggest boxing promoter in the UK and one of the biggest in the world  ....??
This as got bullshit written all over it and it's probably so that fury can garner enough support and people paying for the ngannou fight, must think your born yesterday.
Worst questions ever. We you even listening to him ???
Worst questions ever. We you even listening to him ???
If you can’t see through this.  What a brilliant way to promote the NGannou fight.  This is genius!!!
Fury v Ngannou is a big event but Usyk v Fury is going to be Biggery! The words of Frank Warren! A guy who has made millions and millions and put together some of the biggest fights ever, but he says this will be Biggery! Clown. I won't believe it till I see it confirmed from both sides.
Anyone else thinking this is just pure bullshit? 😂
Same BS every year its signed but no date or venue. Just laughable believe this
fight Tyson fight dubois again do everything you can to avoid hrgovich because if Zhang can't knock out hrgovich with clean shots and we Sean  what Zhang did too joice juggernaut there is no beating primal scull of hrgovich 😂
WTF is all this BS about can't disclose splits , etc. ? Makes zero sense unless the contracted split is predicated on the winner of the contest getting more of the purse... ; ) No noise from Fury though... lol.
USYK WILL DO HIM NOW I THINK. INTERESTING STUFF
gamechanging
Believe it when I see it
When they have both weighed in, and are standing there looking lovingly into each others eyes. Then I'll believe it fish eyes
Excellent marketing PR by Frank the Plank. Zero interest in the Fury fight, so let’s announce this ‘supposed’ fight with Usyk to ramp up the interest in Fury. No venue, no date, no info - what a joke!
Be amusing if Fury walks onto one against Francis.
Why does Talksport bother giving this snake oil salesman airtime? Total BS every time he speaks.
Bullshit
"Its on but i wont tell you anything about it."
Where's Usyk's statement confirming this?? I've not seen him say it's true.
I reckon fury will drop the ball and get KO’d by Francis 😂 I’m willing to put money on it as that’s the kind of fate twist that happens 😂😂😬
He can't get in to the details of the contract because its not happening 😂
Can't take him seriously when last time and I quote he said "it's appppeeeennnnning boys I guarantee it" 😂 I thought Frank was putting in an appeal for dubois because his boy got robbed?
Wonder how much Sky will charge  🤔
Clearly a publicity stunt. I guess Fury vs. Ngannou not selling well so time to throw some Fury drama to stoke that flame… contract supposedly signed but cannot disclose any information whatsoever except “it’s done”
Fury will retire before it happens.
No one it will be a draw,so they will have to do it all again, Happy days for the promoters and the fighters.
they are going to charge us an arm and a leg to watch this on pay per view
Not thay bothered now... Both look past it 😂
Fury is the worst thing to happen to boxing since the sport was conceived. He should be banned from ever stepping in the ring.
LOL. Clickbaiting bellends. No it isn't.
This is tailor made for Fury to pull out as he’s been known to do closer to the time of the fight.....I feel Zhang has earned the right to fight Fury but Fury will avoid him like the plague....
Wow at last....👌👌👌
So they're not fighting then?
What happens if Tyson loses to Francis? That fight is happening first right?
Heard it all before 😂 I will only it’s happening when the ring walks are done
Fantastic news! Finally we will get to see who is the number 1 of this generation. This is a true fight for legacy.
Frank is the worlds no 1 promoter world wide   It’s now a fact
Frank's full of shit*, I dont wanna say anything , but I wanna come on the radio to discuss it. 😂
"We've delivered it" with no date... no venue... depending on what happens with Tyson and Ngannou 😂 have a day off Frank Tyson is definitely rubbing off on you
Sounds exciting, but Frank said it still depends on the Ngannou fight outcome?
Too many people here believe what they see on Facebook
worth a cheeky bet the fight gets delayed due tona fury injury
Perfect 👍
Usyk is the one who's been ducking the fight he only wanted to fight in Saudi so he can get more money. Fury will hammer him.
Warren has a really unlikeable personality
So Usyk v Fury is signed and sealed with no date or venue, etc but we are still strongly pressing WBA for Dubois rematch but nothing will get in the way of this fight!!!  So if Fury gets cut, injured or even loses I’m assuming that’s been considered when BrickTop says ‘Nothing’ will get in the way!!! Obviously this has nothing whatsoever to do at all with the negativity surrounding the pantomime in October!!!!
Fighters signed?  Thought Fury was ducking Usyk when pricing himself out?  You do get some dumb opinions with no common sense.   Come to think of it one works for talksport.  You are a fool Adam, talksport should sack him.
About bloody time ⏲
Load of bollocks. Believe it when i see it
"it's 'uge!!"...
Should of been next
It's ok for warren to spout off about people moaning about this fight getting made but that's his feking job and as yet he has delivered diddly squat. He's says it's signed but doesnt have a date but i could be anytime from late december 23 to end of march 24..............LOL what a joke. He wont even answer simple quests about the purse split etc, hes turned into a petulant child. The quicker this guy retires the better for boxing.
USYK done well in pretending to not be great against Daniel lol he done the same to AJ with chisora 😂
Never get excited yet until the day you see the fighters walk into the ring
Haha bollocks!! Frank wants more ppv for circus show so he is egging the public on.
It's signed! Brilliant I want a ticket where is it ? and when? Just so I can plan my trip and accomodation Frank.
Greedy Belly will keep fighting for influencers, easy paychecks!
Don't want to see it, you bellends have ruined boxing, not to mention the proliferation of drugs, it's like watching junkies getting into the ring
Funny how Fury wouldn’t accept a fight with Usyk then Zhilei Zhang ko’s Joyce and calls him out.  Suddenly the fight is made….
The more frank talks the less interested i get!
I thought Tyson wanted to get in the cage and spark out Jones? Is this the way out of that?
Does the contract say hitting below the belt continuously is perfectly ok?
Is the wbc belt up for grabs with the exhibition fight?
Frank Warren really does sniff his own farts.  We haven’t been driving you mad frank. You and fury have been driving all people who watch boxing mad with your constant bullshit and avoiding the fights that people want to see. As in fury v aj. And now fury v usyk. But we are bored of the fury v usyk fight already. And I still don’t believe it will happen because I don’t believe a word fury and warren say.
So Francis have you realised the exhibition fight no one is interested in isn't making you enough money?
So they need to sell tickets
Considering AJ and Fury have 'signed the contract ' before and nothing came from it, I wouldn't get my hopes up
Ball sh*t. No date ! No location other then the country. No arena or stadium, no clauses. Give it a rest mate. Eddie been getting to much talk with the Connor benn Situ and frank don’t like that. So here he is announcing it on talk sport 😂😂😂😂😂
Franks happy his bank balance is gonna explode
It's boring now but great if it happens
I hope Usyk wins. No longer a fan of Fury.
Problem with frank Warren and Tyson fury is. They have lied so much. That none of us believe a word they say.     Don’t believe you frank.   Unless he is in the ring. I don’t believe it’s happening.  You are both fakes.
massive event game changer bigger than the last event game changer that’s all we hear from Frank bigger and game changer😂
Ring magazine say fury’s number 2 and he is until he beats usyk. Fury has a draw usyk has all W, usyk has more belts and usyk acts like a champion.
I’m hearing waffle waffle waffle
Trying to sell nganou fight as its not selling ppv
So it won’t happen till March if at all. There’s no way this fight happened on December 23rd in fact I still don’t believe it happens at all
I’m all for backing the Brit Frank but Tyson’s only notable wins are Klitschko and Wilder. Needs to beat Usyk and AJ now.
Bet it don't loo
GREAT FIGHT CANNOT WAIT - GET UPPPPPPP
believe it when I see it😊
The rabbits getting it
Bollocks 🍻
Hss trying to be relevant again.  Ilm believe it when i see it. He's got until march to make up an excuse why the fight will not go ahead.. boy that cried wolf
Unlucky Hearn this is gonna give u sleepless nights now small hall Frank has got something u will never have an undisputed heavyweight fight 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Won't happen
Who’s dean?
Finally!! Good for Frank.  He sounds cock a hoop!
Lol funny guy Frank , no date agreed no venue 🤣
Until they enter the ring its not happening
Talksport brown-nosing fury - slagging off AJ for not making big fights the absolute clowns, AJ already fought usyk twice
brick top is a bigger liar than tyson
If this happens I’ll deep fry my own testicles.
Warren will be the biggest clown in boxing if he doesn't back up what he says and the fight dont take place before the end of March.
Very timely to announce this, with up coming joke of a fight. Of course it is happening, we'll believe it when we see it . Fake news IMO
Absolute Lies. Nothing is signed by NO party, Warren talking absolute 💩
Ain't gonna happen after Francis Kos Tyson🥊😂😂😂😂😂
We've heard it all before!!
Anybody else get the impression that this fight wouldn’t be happening if it wasn’t for Fury losing so many fans over it? He can bollocks for me now, I’ll never be a fan of his again. Gonna be a bit awkward if Francis cashes in his punchers chance card 😂
Won't happen. Tyson will find an excuse to duck Usyk once again.
Pfft yeah right
April fools day joke is a bit to early... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why do they keep askin the same questions
The Arabs are dictating this fight Warren is just doing what he's told
I will believe it when I see it / nobody’s buying it ❤️🥊
Prepare to be majorly disappointed!
All still too vague for my liking. I can smell the bullshit from here
Beleive it when I see it!
More bollards 🤨
Frank Warren is the biggest horse shit salesmen alive. Haven’t we had this “signed contract” talk before. No date, no venue, ok frank… what does he get from lying about this 😂😂
Is this fight Frank Warren and Tyson Fury signed and  confirmed, or is it actually signed and confirmed
The fight is signed. When is it? Don’t know Where’s the venue? Not sure What’s the split? That’s private  Is there a rematch clause? Not telling  Why? Don’t want to
PPV mindset - what will it take to get the nitties of the world to buy this fight.
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
At this point, who cares...
From the Saudi perspective. It makes sense to schedule the fight for the 23rd considering how people spend money so freely and willingly around Xmas time.
Warren = Compulsive liar
BULLSHIT
Usyk  is number one and Tyson or Sanchez the Cuban  second.
Furys lot know all of his fans have been stampeding away. Wont believe it until i see it! I cant help thinking this is to promote his upcoming farce.
Watch this space.   Fury retires again. Then comes back to fight Roger Federor or Dillian White
Still plenty of time for Fury to make his excuses and pull out again then.
Won’t happen smoke screen by Warren to get people off his back no date no venue absolute bullshit
I am skeptical. Also, what has happened to mandatory defences? Promotors and management seem to be the real governing bodies now.
We should be worried about the Weapons/Arms that Britain sells to Saudi Arabia, that the Saudi's use against innocent people in the Yemen, than some poncey pantamine boxing bout......morons!!
If they put wilder aj on the undercard that's a joke then 2 might aswell retire let the up and comings try and beat tyson aj should face frank sanchez up and coming wilder
Warren shitting on the undercard confirms it's AJ v Wilder.
Usyk needs to get in range to land his combos then jump back out he does this constantly. He needs to negate Tysons reach advantage and stay away from Fury’s destructive jab. It’s long it’s hard and with that connecting to your face every time you walk in will be brutal. Tyson will be clever enough to fight at range and allow usyk to come in and then Tyson will jab his head off pick him apart with the right hooks, and uppercuts and right crosses. Then at some point you will see that followed by the left body shot game over. Usyk needs to get to Tyson. Tyson doesn’t need to get to Usyk
Reading the bollocks that’s been written Fury can’t punch, fury can’t take a punch,he’s slow pml😂😂. Casuals man Fury got up from punch from wilder, he knocked out wilder twice. One of those was a brutal body punch. Hes got a gut wrenching undercut. He’s got some of the fastest hands in the hw division. So unless usyk wins on points he ain’t knocking out fury. Fury at this weight has more weapons. Usyk is a great fighter but fury is the bigger man and uses his beef well he smothers opponents plus there’s the sword like jab
I think they have come out with this news before Fury fights Ngannou, hoping the Ngannou fight will get more PPVs and try reclaim some of the fans Fury has lost by messing his fans about not fighting Usyk previously..
Believe it when we see it... Somehow it look s doubtful. This fish eyed con man talks the talk. Very evasive.  I just hope it's true.  What if Francis knocks him out? Far too evasive.
When the ring walk takes place between the two , I’l believe it . These lot are con artists and clowns
Big pay day for tyson this year
Smoke and mirrors, to be relevant.
Not delivered!  Believe it when there in the ring
To sell the Chisora fight they did exactly the same thing 😂 hopefully this time it's not a lie and we get the fight!
Pie in the sky. 2024 when? Look stuff happens, look, believe it it when you see it. Fury is extremely  come day go day.
When skills challenge were doing the boxing in Saudi Arabia it was all Aj and Macthroom now the new guys have taken over it’s all Tyson and Frank Warren.
Good this is the fight we demanded. Now Fury can prove he’s the best without shouting his mouth off.  Oh I should add this “The split is now irrelevant” and the “Rematch clause” is confidential
Had to happen both of them don't want to fight zhang 😂
Fury dhould let his cousin Huey Fury step in and Fight Ninganu and dodge that potenial banana peel and focus fully on being fight fit to bang out Usyk
I still hope ngannou breaks tysons face.
Frank can’t sell the Nnganou fight sales are down PPV is not looking good now he’s mentioning Usyk to make it all sound good! Tyson don’t want that fight!
Warren is deluded if he thinks this fight is bigger than AJ/WILDER OR AJ/FURY. This is the smallest fight out the big 3 fights...It will be a complete bore fest like all fury the clowns fights...He's a complete fraud..His resume is total dog shit...Darren bent get a grip,fury not even in top 50 of all time....He's fought absolutely no one..An old man in Klitschko and a one trick pony in wilder and you idiots still bang on about him been best of a generation..FFS .🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣...
I feel like hgrovic will come and crumble the party like wilder did againt fury 3 !!!!!!! Watch 😂😂😂😂
Biggest PR stunt in history!
Both will do all the rounds to the end Uysk wins by rounds by decision I predicted here first 😎👍
Bullshit
Won’t happen full off it
What about "i won't step aside " hrgovic ?
Fury will let usyk dance round the ring infront of him and keep him at the end of his jab for a couple of rounds to see what his game plan is and take him apart a lot of people slate fury but he is very clever when he steps it that ring amazing technical boxing brain look how he took wilder apart
Frank is a smart promoter! He has just made the Fury vs Ngannou fight relevant and people will watch this fight now, watching to see if Fury looses. This was smart timing to announce Fury vs Usyk.
Frank is bullshittiiing
Fury will find a way out
Seems more like he’s trying to raise ppv buys for the Ngannou fight, if people believe he’s fighting Usyk next then ppv buys a will rise for Fury’s current fight…… Hope i’m wrong but i’ll believe it when I see it.
Usyk is about like when Adamek was beating up on an old Goliath.  To me, this fight means nothing.  Fury took this fight as the lesser of two evils.  Nobody wants to fight Zhang right now….,most exciting fighter the HW division has seen in 20+ years.
CLICK BAIT 🔥🔥🔥
Seems like this I an an attempt to sell the Tyson Mgannue fight .
The heavyweight division is beyond a joke 🤦🏻
Newsflash.....Uysk has just agreed to a 90/10 split so we know it's definitely on 😂
I’ll believe it wen i see fury in the ring with usyk,hopefully it does happen coz I’m looking.forward to seeing usyk win,you no they have fcuked usyj again on the split & 1000% there’s a rematch in the contract fury ain’t taking that fight with out one,if he was confident at beating usyk he’d of fought him long time ago,I think this is being done to help sell the UFC circus shite
The BS circus continues... somebody pls,put down these clowns... so YAWN
Bullshit fury is the worse heavyweight out there
Fury is used to fighting boxers who are static and with no movement and foot work like Chisora, Whyte and Wilder. Otto Wallin a southpaw with little movement did damage to Fury. Imagine what Usyk will do to him. Fury will gas out. Usyk by decision or late stoppage.
I thought Francis had a rematch clause with fury? Frank's talking ballocks
If its been confirmed that means there's not a cat in hells chance of it taking place. You read it here!
Till I see Usyk doing his funny ringwalk, and Fury too. Then I'll believe
Believe it when I see it. Fury trying to make it look like he wants to fight Usyk to try and get some fans back
This could be a fight Fury could possibly loose.. Usek was too elusive and technical. Those leaning or rabbit punch won't work..
What a mess
What a fkucing weasel.
How can a fight be signed before the next fight has even taken place .  I can’t listen to Frank Warren anymore. As Ricky Hatton said boxing has became like a circus . I’d like to add to that and say boxing has became a merry go round at a circus  One good thing is …..I hardly listen to talk sport now   and am actually taking part in sports instead .  Nice one
Feed greedy belly to Zhang. Furry lost his respect and his fanboys😂
Hahahaha come on . Stop just filling your show with fake news
False just trying to keep the hype around fury. They will definitely pull out again
Tyson will never be the best. He’s good but not the best.
This is Fury we're talking about. Don't trust this fight until they're both in the ring.
don't hold your breath everyone!.....its frank warren !!...its highly likely to be complete bollocks!!
Dubois / Joyce rematch makes sense
I think they have only said this to sell the shit show coming up soon , 😮
Why now?? He might think nganou is a real threat so booked the usyk fight just Incase he gets chinned.👊
AJ fury for old times sake please franky.magic
What rubbish 🗑..  no date   ? .. It will take a miracle They'll have an agreement in principle and that's all.. 😂
Yes, these are the types of fights Fury should be fighting as a champion.
Bollocks . And even if it is  fury said he ain't fighting him just last week he said that
Gutted, was hoping for Fury vs Chisora 4!
Not heard any of Usyks camp confirming this.  Just a cheap trick to gain interest in the upcoming farce of a fight.  Nonsense
Thank goodness for that body shot. Without it we'd never see all four belts strapped around the waist of one man! All hail Dubois, best promoter in boxing history.
If tyson Beats Usyk it's expected
TYSON fool us once  Shame on you  TYSON fool us twice  Shame on us  TYSON fool us THREE TIMES…… ….. AINT HAPPENING BRO 😎   THIS IS ALL HYPE TO SELL FRANCIS FIGHT AND THROW US OFF   FRANK WARREN HAS SIGNED ZHANG FOR ☝️ REASON   TO HOLD UP DIVISION 🤦‍♂️ ZHANG WILL BECOME MANDATORY FOR USYK
We don't want to see Ddb rightnow Frank
No one out here has any confidence this is happening. Fury apparently has seen it's  ok to continually low blow Usyk so has a plan
Fury and Usyk were both in on it from the get go.  Leaving everyone guessing!!
Fury AJ is the fight that needs to happen
Tyson doesnt have doubters..Usyk is good but I believe Tyson will whack him.  I love Usyk but I think  the Gypsy King got  this
If Fury takes it seriously its a walk in the park for the Big Man
Don't believe a word.
Good man Frank
The moment Frank said yes I liked the comment and now I believe as now we can support Fury in Peace
1000% this won't happen
Only believe it when I see them in the ring fighting until then it’s not confirmed
Yeah man 👍
Biggest fight of century. That’s pretty disrespectful. No way that true in my eyes but whatever.
Imagine if the MMA guy kos fury 😂
😂
6:22 6:27
The money grabbing dosser Fury will find some reason not to fight.
I love to believe fight happens but let's be honest coming from Warren with all the BS he been spilling about Fury im not going to get excited tell i see them in the ring.
When I see them stepping into the ring, I will get excited.
i cant wait thanks tyson fury an frank warren an uysk an arum an every body that got this done skills challenge its undisputed its the biggest fight of the century thanks to all involved that got this fight signed sealed deliver an i cant wait thanks its the fight all the fans want to see im going for tyson fury knock out an tyson fury is going to win i cant wait its the fight fans want to see most an they are the two best fighters right now an one is going to lose an i think tyson fury wins knockout cant wait its history
Omg!!! Lewis, bowe (92), holyfield (91), tyson (87-89), all tool fury!! Can we stop jizzing over a guy whose record is worse than Henry Akinwande
He should fight Filip or lose the ibf belt
dubum doesnt deserve a rematch.  low blow area was made clear
Id ❤ to believe it. I think Usyk absolutely tools fury!    I think if fury thought uysk was a piece of piss we'd have had it by now! Let's just hope ngannou doesn't spoil the parade!!
So many fury SIMPS here. He tricked all of you 😂
24hrs ago fury  was saying no interest in fighting uysk   calling him gap tooth with no English with no sales value   24hrs later Frank says signed 😅😅
"(Fury) one of the greatest heavyweights ever"?????!!!!!! Based on beating an old and unmotivated Klitschko with whom he ducked the rematch....and 3 victories over one dimensional Wilder who has beaten nobody but old man Ortiz who beat him every round in both fights!   Fury hasn't even proved he is best in this era... Hasn't faced Joyce, Parker, Zhang, Joshua, Ruiz (nor Pulev and Povetkin when they were around). Victories over poor opponents like Whyte & Chisora don't count as anything when claiming to be 'best' of your generation, let alone of 'all time'.
Nobody wins because it's not going to happen,  anything to sell tickets,  Frank Warren  is uk Donald Trump,  I can't remember him being truthful about anything..  It's all signed all of a sudden before fury upcoming flop  😅😅  Fury done this before every fight to sell tickets,
Warren will probably announce that the appeal went through after the Ngannou fight... Usyk Dubious 2 will ruin it like Wilder Fury 3 ruined the AJ fight
Every time asked about the fight with Ngannau the response is "this 'event'.. they ask about the fight again.. "this event". So there isn't a fight?
Sounds like hes stalling for another year b4 he can find some excuse. Injury or something. We all know he doesnt keep hos word ever. He just stalls the rest up. and messes up there camps and age when want 2 fight. Dosser ;)
Dean Bent was confused.
Ok first heavyweight chess match if this happens.
There is a reason why there is only a rough date its all in the marketing but the saudis don’t mess about…its done!
Yawn. Lyson fury isnt gonna keep his word
We're not deceived
Lies upon lies…. NO DATE
I'll belive it when I see it.
Dubois can not beat USYK.
The undercard is a game  changer
Bull$hit
I doubt it will happen. Frank Warren has no details for it so how can it?
I smell bull$hit
How dumb does one have to be to constantly ask if there is a fight date only to be told constantly no!!!
Hi dean 😂
The two most skilled fighters on the planet, but one thing for certain it won't be a fight of skill. Fury is so obviously sh/t scared of bein out classed, he gonna lean & smuther & turn it into a borefest. Can only hope for an unbias ref that won't tolerate it…
Wouldn’t believe a word of it just yet  This is to promote the ticket sales for Fury vs Ngannou
no fight signed this is just a ploy to get the PPV for the francis fight cause no one had bought the fight... i guarntee this fight wont happen cause you cant sign for a fight without a date due to promo and training camp .....facts
Frank needs fury to win after dubois and joyce got smashed up
By irrelevant he means he's embarrassed by how little they've give Usyk.
Imagine if ngannu knocked out fury 😅
A very cagey interview by Frank, which suggests this is going to be more bullshit.
This like when fury thanked Daniel kinahen for getting the Joshua fight over the line 4 yrs ago but I still can't remember the fight
Ill believe it when i see it .. 😂
Frank has got the fury bug,always talking shit
Won't happen
About time. 🥊🇮🇪🥊
The Poms are too stupid to realise what Furys intentions were. He was hoping Dubois beat Usyk to give his fellow Brit the chance to become world champion, when that didn't happen he was hoping Joe Joyce would have been next in line to fight Usyk. Tyson Fury should be loved by all. He is a shrewd business man.
So if I Heard them right, it could be up to five months before they fight ? And what about Francis ?? Who's francis gonna fight ? SO MANY QUESTIONS 😵‍💫😵‍💫🥴🤫
We heard all of this before I won't believe it till they r both in the ring
🤡🤡 yu both are
Will this be the first time all heavy weights belts are unified? Or at least by a British boxer
I'll believe it when I see the signed contract.
Gonna be a great fide
I think this is a lot of crap
Fury is Frank's last hope
The idea that Fury is ‘scared’ of Usyk is laughable. NO fighter is scared of any other fighter. They all back themselves. A fat Fury went to America to fight the most thunderous puncher of his generation. Before that he went to Germany to fight the previous biggest puncher. Before that he was signed to fight a prime David Haye who was a heavy favourite. Usyk will enter their fight the underdog for a reason.
So a week ago fury said he will never fight usyk ever Frank Warren is so full of s@#£ untill there in the ring I don't believe it simple as that
Fury really is tarnishing his legacy with this stuff
Yeah right it will never happen
I think they are scared of Zhang
I won't believe it until they're both in the ring
Bet fury comes out with a so called injury after francis fight
Frank ‘ for the fans ‘ Warren
Some absolutely terrible questions here! Biggest fight going and asking about undercard ffs
Happen during a season?! Why not a specific date? Why no details? Why am I being a cynic?
Fury v Usyk Undisputed fight signed and a man charged for 2pac's murder all on the same day, this is seismic and strange at the same time
He’s got to fight AJ and Zhang and then maybe cement a legacy! Wilder has no skills and fury made it look hard! Wilder had never beaten anybody good so why was everybody so pleased with fury! Fury needs to beat ruiz, fury is younger that AJ and usyk, Joyce so he has time to fight the others so if he walks away then he’s a mallard duck!
Lies on Drive???
Anyone who believes that Fury will be fighting Usyk is living in cloud kuku land.
What happened to all the gights in December aj wilder uski and now nobody's fighting in December its next March I give up
Will believe this when the bell goes 🛎️
😅😅😅
Fury better hire Sienwaski Fencing to gain the footwork for the 678 th..
Tyson fury is not 6ft9. Just like everything the fury’s say, exaggerated!
500 million is nothing to the Saudis.. if fury stuck to 500 mil then it looks like it is what it is..
This is one for the Sucka's 😂😂
Isn't it fantastic, no date, no purse information, no venue other than it's in Saudi Arabia & it's all dependent on Fury coming through the Nganou fight unscathed. What could possibly go wrong? I'll believe it when I see it, sadly Fury has a track record of pulling out of fights & there are so many excuses available for him to do the same with this fight.
Asking Frank Warren "how big is this?" And "how excited are you?". Gimme a break.
usyk getting 40% 🤣
Usyk's team have confirmed it so i actually getting my hopes up. Fury will probably trample on them though
Muhhhhhhhh brudahhhhhhhs Big bang Chinese power should fight Joshua in December and then be on deck for the winner of this fight 🫡
I don’t reckon this fight happens. Fury playing games; either gonna pull out due to “injury” against Ngannou, or Warren is bribe to force a Dubois rematch which gets in the way. This is probably just to make Fury look like he was keen for the fight and it didn’t happen for other reasons so people stop accusing him of ducking. Warren is playing chess.
I think GAD caught wind of this and thats why he's been saying they will fight for weeks now.   I also bet salty frank has frozen hearn out with the saudis. That turkey al whatever dude literally killed skills challenge and the AJ fight 😂
Between October or march?? It’s rubbish .. false news to boost fury next fight.. usyk has mandatory to fulfil before.. it’s  ibf and also wbo … both mandatory’s have to fulfil before February …
Tyson has only beaten 6 champions in his entire career, now where near the same level as Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis, And the greatest of them all Mohammad Ali.
Fight USYK.
Wasn't the aj fight also signed? Hope it happens but i doubt it
Fury going to smash his head in, anyone got any problems?, go suck aj willy
Genuinely scared for Ngannou now..
All I heard was money money money Middle East money caravan for me mam big mistake Usyk
Greedy belly
Franks basically given nothing here 😂
These two are clueless, tells them when it’ll be, between nov-march, “so it could be April” morons…
I think this fight needs to take place, it's the one fight that everyone wants to see happen now. I do think Usyk is very good, I really wouldn't like to predict who would win this one. One thing about Usyk, he's very skilled and throws a lot of punches per round to rack up the points and wear his opponents down towards the latter rounds. I think Fury might just struggle against Usyk unless Fury can finish him off inside 7 or 8 rounds. But Usyk has shown he can take a punch and Fury isn't really known for being a big puncher anyway
if done was provisionally done. As Joyce and Dubois loss made happen.
I smell.something!
Didn't fury say 2 days ago he'll never fight Usyk?
Now Francis is definitely going to get the w. The fight destined not to happen.
warren is talking total bks.😅😅😅😅😅
I believe it if usyk say it is   this I can't believe
People are always bad mouthing Fury, you will have to find someone else to pick on when Fury destroys Usyk because Fury will smash Usyk easily.
It was announced something might happen 😂😂😂
why would anyone believe this random announcement? unless they've got a brain injury?
It's on..Frank's stuffed eddie AGAIN AND AGAIN 🤡🤡😂😂🤡
all total nonsense..
About bloody time! 😂 Fury would be finished if he doesn’t accept this fight.Fury’s last few fights have been fixed.He’s fought some very low ranking appointments.Fury’s punching power won’t affect USKY what so ever.
I think Tyson raises his game depending on who he faces and will put on a masterclass, I like them both but can’t see Usyk getting too near Tyson just think Tyson out scores him by a reasonable distance… another trilogy I imagine
Am I the only one that thinks they through Daniel in there to test Usyks weaknesses for Tyson
Finally!!!! A part of me feels like it may fall apart but god I hope not! Let's go tyson! Give us joshua after that and nobody can complain! Just like Floyd all about timing and faced everyone!
very odd way to announce Fury / Chisora 4
Don’t believe it till there in the ring
Fury is running from Zhang 😂
Only fighting coz Dubois did him.....total dosser
Am i the only one who thinks Fury vs Francis is going to do much less business than projected?
Is frank warren a man or a snake?
Frank used to be "Arfur Daley" in Minder.... Ducking and diving lol
I’ll believe it when I see them in the ring together.
Usyk has quicker footspeed, better balance and punch co-ordination but fury feels usyk may be vulnerable hence why he's taking the fight 😂😅😅😂
Gotta love Frank.
if anyone thinks this fight is going to happen on the 23rd of dec or even within the next 6 months you are easy fooled..let me give you some facts...tyson fury is currently 350lbs..thats 25 stone...he will get into the ring against ngannou weighing 24 stone...if you think fury is then going to lose another 4 stone to fight uysk in just 8 weeks then dream on..anything above 20 stones against uysk is a death wish...so its not going to happen anytime soon...it may be signed but it will be pushed back and pushed back and then pushed back again..this is a cunning ploy by warren to try and sell the fury v ngannou fight which is struggling to sell the over priced broadcasting rights to tv networks around the world..in other words there isnt the interest that warren had hoped for a mma fighter against an elite boxer...its all a con..
Why's their first questions about splits and how much money the fight could generate? Who cares!? Plus we know they dont do splits over there
Usyk signed with skilled promotions for more money that’s why it hasn’t happened yet and once fury kicks the little man’s ass then people can finally shit up I dnt what to here nothing about usyk was to small fuck tht
I won’t believe it’s on until both fighters are in the ring and I hear DINGGGG 🔔 heard too much bullshit !!!
Frank delivers.
I’ll believe it when I hear the first round bell ring.
Ngannou by ko the spanner in the works.
No date means no fight frank changing the game like the game changer he thinks he is 😅
We'll probably know more after the Mickey Mouse fight on October 28th 🐁
Very few details by Warren is not exactly a good sign...
What was Darren Bent writing down.  Post it.  For the Funsies.
tyson had to take the fight, the public were turning on him. as for the ngannou fight, that is fixed for tyson to win.
I hope this happens it needs to I respect fury with what he goes through with his bipolar and I hope he really wants it
What about the IBF?.Hrgovic is the next mandatory and could potentially scupper undisputed.Believe it when I see it signed and sealed with Arena and date confirmed.Too many porkies told and sceptical of anything Frank says.
This fight ain’t happening, ngannou’s gonna turn furys lights out with a lucky punch
All the haters' faces right now LOL
I smell a fish, I mean a rat.
These two work really well together
Who's the sponsors ? The uak tax payer or the Ukraine washing machine company ? 😂✌️💚💚
So the fight is confirmed? Yes    and the sham mma fight wont make a difference if he loses?  Actually yes..   but Dubois situation wont effect it..   wellllll yes..     but dont worry its definitely happening   🤦‍♂️  Just remember.. the fight with AJ was confirmed. FULL OF SHIT
Till he gets a bad cut or needs an operation on hand or something no doubt!Load of crap!!💯💩💩
Usyk be rockin up with his shorts fastened to his chin
Did i hear frank say NIGGAnu 6:15
Should of had Simon Jordan in the studio grilling Frank
I'll believe it when i see them touch gloves
Didnt Eddie hearn have one of tgese desert sand saudi contracts for aj wilder, but they had a date and vemue with skills challenge,  until sheik bin suleiman decided he was bored of playing boxing promoter with skills challenge, now sheik mohammed wants a go and starting saudi open season and has given a sand contract, no date or time, no real contract or venue. Until theres a venue, daye, and they are walking to the ring, i dont believe it
That will be the day, LOL
YAWN!!!
Him saying as long as there is no hiccups shows they are worried he is gonna get beat or an excuse to pull out
More lies from frank Warren and tyson fury.
Eddie round the hearn dinner table on Sunday “dad, dad, don’t i run boxing in Saudi, don’t i, don’t I”
Frank should fight Eddie on the undercard
Lennox lewis do fury in 4/5 rounds.😢
Lennox lewis do fury in 4/5 rounds.
Ohhhhhh Eddie Hearn is Crying Ohhhh Eddie Hear n is crying Inside AJ's dying Inside AJ's Dying  THE GYPSY KING VS THE UKRAINIAN WHO WILL NOT DEFEND HIS COUNTRY
Lennox lewis do few inside 4 rounds.
Fury don’t want the fight the Chinese guy beats them both.
Fury injury during Ngannu fight incoming
Love the fact he supposedly makes one of the biggest fights of all time but hasnt thought about the money
And 4 hours earlier. Tyson saying he wouldn't fight Uysk because he offered him 30 % and he didn't take it saying he's a middleweight. If anyone believes anything out of the Fury's mouth at any point. You sir are DUMB.
About f%&kin time! Still have my doubts.
Will believe it when it’s fight night, not until then 😁
Frank your full of crap
Fury beats the mma guy , then bears Usk is , go down in history. Them fights Joshua in his last match , then loses then wins the rematch
The date is 23rd of December, might be pushed to January or February at most. Take it to the bank.
Translation: need more hype for the ngannu circus fight
Poor Usyk in big trouble!
It's all bollocks
Saudi money was always going to get this deal done, just look at the ridiculous numbers that they're paying for old washed-up footballers so there is no surprise that they can fund the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world between two unbeaten fighters.
👻The ghost contract is signed but not a smidgeon of detail from shady Warren. More vacuous bullshit...
We will believe it when we see it fish eyes
Here we go again beleive it when theyre both in the ring
Believe it when i see it lol no date? what about Ngannou rematch clause if Fury loses?
I only believe when krassyuk says its agreed & done... Frank & Fury full of shit... Who knows maybe so fans can overlook and they can sell out nganou' fight
Do you really think frank gives a fuck about usyk and tyson he's getting paid more without them fighting frank doesn't give 2 fucks if they fight or don't it's money none of them need
What was ,the low blow decision,?
I remember about 4 weeks back and out of nowhere Alex krasiak was asking Fury to sign, so I realised they was negotiating, can't wait, come on tyson 🥊
Get Joshua on the undercard And ill buy it     Only joking id never pay for something i can watch for free
About time that Frank got a big deal done, well done Frank, can't wait. You had me worried there for a while.
*Breaking news* ... Tyson Fury pulls out to fight The Undertaker in hell in a cell at wrestlemania 2024😂
Id rather see Usyk Zhang if Im honest or even a fully fit re ivered from knee acl injury Dubois rematch with usyk.  fvk Fury. Taking fans for mugs
Corn pop was a bad dude...😬
Thought it was 23rd dec   Now bricktop saying could be early march Also  Usyk wins  If you stop fury from clinching you stop him from winning
Yeooo can’t wait to see Tyson beat Usyk and he will that’s a fact. Tysons unbeatable.
Greedy belly will find his way out
Don't believe it, not after all the bs previously.
Daniel shite and frank knows it
Yawn 🥱
“When’s it going to happen?” “It’s going to be between October & March”   Can’t stand Frank Warren 🤦🏻‍♂️
Of course he won't tell us the purse split cause it will show that The Gypsy waffler is getting the largest cut and that Usyk is up for the fight no matter what
It’s not done, this is just marketing…
I hope people understand that even if no one buys the ngannou fight, fury will still receive the agreed upon cheque
Fury finally found the balls and  the courage to fight usyk 🤣🤣that dubois low blow vulnerability helped fury find his pen ✍️
Im calling bullshit. Been here too many times before.
Frank Warren is one step a head of Eddie Hearn.  Hes alotttt more buisness like in most aspects, sure Hearn is good at what he does, im not taken that away from him, but frank Warren is just 2 steps ahead. Hearn is just a good talker, brilliantly if thats what iy boils down too, but frank Warren is oh so shrewdly ahead of Warren....
Wont happen
I'll believe it when i see it
Lol AJ will look like a right clown now if he doesn't fight Wilder.
Finally I don’t care about the details just glad it’s happening
That stunt to get them ppv sales for this nonsense fight coming up by dangling The Undisputed fight....
So Fury will make at least 300 mil in a span of 5 months right?
I believe in uncle Frank.
😂 won’t happen let’s believe it when I see it
Was going to ignore the ngannou fight completely but might watch it now. Clever.
I smell BS
....why do I not believe this will happen 😅
I hope it comes off this time.
I'll believe  it when i see it 😂 Signed  but no date or details 😂😂😂
What going to happen if IF Tyson gets KO D next month  🤔!!!
😂😂😂 🐂💩
FW … “It’s only because it’s in Saudi this fight is happening” … what a world of greed we’re living in 😢
Tyson always wanted it he was just waiting for Saudi to give the best money for the fight.   Tyson beats every heavyweight today.
Let me tell you ehats going to happen. Fury is using this sell the Francis fight, he will pull out and then Zhang will step in lol.
They also said a few years bak that AJ vs Fury was "signed" with the help of Daniel kinahan
Not going to believe it till I see it but at least this is a good sign. Desperately want to see this fight get made but we have every reason to be nervous about it based on Tyson's past.
Yes!!! This is great news for heavyweight boxing. Finally this fight is happening then hopefully fury v joshua
10:25 too quick
Fury gonna duck again, Usyk to win.
'It was confirmed that there were rumours coming out of America that...' You nearly had me there, muppet.
Pffff. End of the year is amazing in boxing and UFC. If all those fights go ahead will be an amazing end of the year for contac sports.
I hope Tyson gave him less than 30% 😂😂
Why can’t fish eyes give details? I don’t understand?
Usyk will only win of his beat friend ref is in the ring fury bests him easy wilder got put down with a body shot from fury hw womt get away eih cheating vs fury lost alll respect for usyk after his 3rd controversial win vs british fighters joe Joyce obeqt him and so did dc qnd ofcourse 5h2 supposed low blow
Details will probably will be announced in Saudi Arabia with the Crown Prince and as part of a press conference with the boxers in attendance.
Battle of the bellys
Frank the wank can only bring up two fights everytime hes asked about furys resume
This is crock of BS.  Frank is about as succinct as Boris Johnson was with the public during Covid.  What a joker.
Valentine's day massacre
Damn good show
It won't happen and now Frank saying uysk no 2 in the world when he been saying any battered cod with boxing's on gloves on would beat uysk
This fight won't happen, I said they'll agree it and Fury will pull out. Fury wants to make as much money as he can as a champion. he'll retire. He doesn't want to fight.
If weve learned anything from AJ - Wilder, never believe this shit 🤣
I think Nganno is more likely to beat Tyson than USYK is. 3rd round mega surprise uppercut by Nganno puts Tyson out. USYK doesn't have the power to hurt Tyson and not sure will go the distance, which USYK can only hope it does for a chance to win on points.
_Very_ smart move to get this done and announced before the Ngannou fight. It saves Fury from looking like a complete idiot and guarantees more ppv buys.
I couldn't give a shit....its a fookin pantomime the heavy weight division...I'm bored of the lot of them...i won't watch any of these chicken shits any more
Both sides have said that they have signed   Saudi Arabia have said that they are putting it on   Yet fans are trying to make it out like it won't happen   I think usyk fans are worried that they will be watching fury win   Lets be honest usyk can't beat fury and its not going to be an exciting fight   But its signed why is everyone crying
The fight is booked for the closing ceremony, Fury is doing the opening fight and the closing fight.
I’ll believe it when they’re in the ring throwing punches at each other.
Bricktop has the money man of Saudi backing him all the way so this will happen and will most likely close the Riyadh season. That will mean Fury will open and close the festival.
Boom
Frank said we’ve got the BIG fight first between Fury Vs Ngannu which is a huge fight & massive event 😂😂😂  A fight between an Ex UFC fighter & Fury is far far from a big fight it’s a Joke & a mockery, i’d laugh my tits off if Tyson were to lose especially by K.O. 😂.
The was more money involved this time then in april. What everyone was saying was true, haters got wrecked again by the truth. The fight is happening like we Said all along! 🥊💥💯
I’m so happy this fight is happening but Frank is the master of saying a lot without saying anything. 😂 no real possible dates, won’t reveal purse splits, no news on the undercard… Tyson still needs to win the N’gannou fight, which he absolutely should, but just imagine he gets KO’d and it ruins the undisputed heavyweight fight we’ve waited so long for 🙏🙏
Now… Ssssssssssssshhhh
Waffle Waffle Waffle, that's all 💩
Fury does what he wants! Hes so clever he just has the public in his hands and will be making fortunes of these 2 fights
Fury Usyk locked in for December Koogz!
Fury wins that fight IF and WHEN it ever happens! Too big, too powerful and to skilful for Usyk imo. Really hope it materialises because its the fight everybody wants too see!!
I can smell Bullshit so Frank must be able to taste it because it's on his lips ! Good marketing for the fight nobody is interested in watching between Tyson and Ngannou though .
Until the Dubois case comes through and then theyll delay Fury vs Usyk and say its out of their hands. But this will help sell the ngannou fight...
I'll believe when I see it.
Well i guess usyks winning streak is about to come to a end. He is about to fight a 6 ft 9 version of himself.
I'll believe it when I see them walk out to the ring!
Hype... Hype.. Hype.
somebody wrote how he doesnt believe it and its just a way to get favour for tyson before this joke of an event...cant help but buy into tht coz frank is a shyster
A tactic to make everyone watch Fury vs Ngannou!!!
Rumor has it that the fight is possibly confirmed for some time in the future.
""its for the four belts''  how about Hrgovic and how about the Dubois appeal? Frank is lying through his teeth
Well iv come on here to read the comments and yep the good old British public aint happy for fuck sake nothing can make people happy 😂 atleast im happy 😊 just hope francis is as bad as he looks on the pads 😂
The fight is on magic fury all the way he’s champ and fantastic guy
i liked the non pluss reaction to frank tryinf to be excited, bcoz weve been here to many times before
It’s irrelevant on what the split is….translation; usyk is having his pants down. The season until March…..translation; if Tyson hasn’t hit his target on the Forbes list after fighting Francis then we’ll fight in December to secure that. Otherwise it’ll be February.
publicity stunt for the ngannou event.i'll believe this when and if the pre fight antics begin.
So this fight is a YEAR away
So where did the 23rd come from🤣🤣🤣🤣 you Hink there gonna box 2 days before Xmas when he’s got kids? Yer aff yer tits it’ll be 2024👍🏼
Liar! Fury did not fight Klitschko in Klitschko's backyard; it was in the Esprit Arena in Düsseldorf, Germany. That is NOT part of Klitschko's property.
Surely frank warren can't ruin his and Tyson's reputation even more...  As if we couldn't believe a word he says already, if this fight doesn't happen now truly we can never listen to this man again.
Cleverly setting up a date announcement after Ngannou to try and get people to buy the ppv.
When I heard this on the news today, my first thought was "The Fury vs Ngannou fight must not be selling well".   Please people do not buy this fight, otherwise novelty matches is all you will be looking at for the next hundred years.
So de we take it as we all know ngannou a payed exhibition scripted like wwe 😂😂😂
Fury's gonna get knocked out by Nagannou and retire to pull off 1 more duck against Usyk lol.
Don’t fall for it guys they want you to watch his bs fight so he’s telling ppl wot we want to hear
Why ask about purse split. Couldn’t care less
Damn Frank will be able to rent out York Hall a few times once Bob Arum gives him his pocket money after this fight.
"The biggest fight of this century" - It's hard to argue, but I'm sure some might. Either way, the fact that Eddie Hearn has nothing to do with it tickles my cockles.
2:42 My god did Andy not listen?? He said BEFORE March....
bit of a wide window. 6months. he said signed. i bet he doesnt wanna say because he knows it wont look good on tyson and how usyks been bent over a barrel
Somethings not right? Can't blame anyone for been apprehensive Frank!
That “is done” sounded more like a “it’s not happening”.
Fury already making plans ,just incase francis knock him out🤣🤣
Frank saying Usyk is the second best fighter in the world after Fury, but also says Dubois beat Usyk and cheated. And Dubois can beat him again in a rematch.
There’s more grey areas with this fight than the British sky
It will never happen
WOW 👌💥💥💥💥
I will believe it when Fury actually climbs through the ropes, metal health, money , contractual issues etc etc
Utter boll***s. You can only sign a contract for a fight if there is a date and a venue set. They are sh*tting it cause Fury is losing fans rapidly. Usyk looked average against Dubois so Fury  fancies a taste. Be careful tho as Usyk looked average against Chisora then he rocked AJs world x 2 !! Glad these guys pressed Frank btw, shows me that it is no official and it is NOT signed. They are worried about revenue loss no doubt as no c*nt wants to see Fury outbox a slow and telegraphic punching MMA fighter
BS!!!!!! The Fury vs Ngannou fight sale is not doing well. So he wants to use the news to sell it.
This won’t happen 😂😂😂
Fury is gna pull out this fight...hes using this to promote his nganou fight which is probably doing smaller numbers now... I will only believe it when I hear it from usyk....and skills challenge....the fact they want to only tell us after the nganou fight, is cos they wanna sell ppv numbers for the nganou fight... Then they will either say nganou is forcing the rematch...or Tyson gets hurt.... Lol or frank knows the corrupt sullimam is going to give ddd the rematch...  Theres no way Tyson is fighting usyk..... Unless hes avoiding zhang.....but even then...
I'll believe it when there in the ring.
These two presenters  are crap
Not going to happen! Tyson retires soon
I can't wait for this fight to happen its going to be the best fight of all time. It has the most money ever recorded written all over it. My money is on Usyk he's just that good. FURY is good but Usyk is technically better.
Telling you now nobody’s interested in fury’s fight so they have come out with usyk fight to get everyone spending money then they will back out wait and see
This fight is not going to happen ! This is just a publicity stunt by Frank Warren to rehabilitate Fury reputation with boxing fans before the farce Fury-Ngannou..
Why do the broadcasters keep pointing & waving?
I smell bollocks
I'm a fury fan boy, but even I won't believe the fight is on until they are stood opposite each other and the first bell rings
Contracts mean nothing to fury. I want fury to beat usyk. But history says this match will not go ahead and its all a big ploy to get ppl to watch a mis match.
What’s the purse split? Who cares 😂 we ain’t getting the money
Believe it when I see it
Until they’re sitting alongside each other at the presser i don’t believe it..strange they come out with this just before Fury’s tickling contest
I believe it when I see it.
Usyk will mess him up.
Only thing fury too tall to aim lower body of usyk
Fury saw usyk struggle against Dubois, and thought I'll take that fight a few weeks after my Ngannou bout. It's light work for Fury tbh
I'd love to believe this, but considering Fury's past antics, I envisage more shithousery from camp Fury.
Easy night for Fury. He’s going to be ripping Usyk to the body
Lol would rather take he s chances with usyk then to face the big bad mighty zhang..........fury your a coward!!!!
These 2 clowns shouldn't be involved in anything boxing related, they know nothing about the sport and don't even listen to the answers to the questions they are told to ask. Pathetic interview and total disrespect to Frank Warren
Frank sending Usyk a slave Contract and gonna make sure hes "Knackered" pardon the pun ! By fight time.
Fury will find a way to duck Usyk. Fury is The Ducking King.
I remember when Tyson Fury used to be a boxer, it was quite a while ago though so not sure if Fury has anything left now.
Let’s hope Ngannou doesn’t spoil the party by knocking Fury out 😂. Although Fury is expected to win, it does add another level of pressure on Fury to win relatively unscathed. I’m nervous for Fury now.
mediocre.... both past their best....
Usyk is unbeatable
60 40 to Fury and rematch clause as a trap.
No date , no fight . This is lies .
And about time too...if it actually happens because there's no date or venue yet, just hype from one side of the fence. Let's see what Alex Krassyuk has to say to see if he lines up with Warren!  I'm still not watching Fury Vs Ngannou nonsense regardless
whats the reason behind saying this? seems very odd to release this information now with no details and the fact fury is fighting ngannou first
It just feels like franks telling lies doesn’t sound comfortable probably doing to hype nganno fight get fans back on board
What if Francis ngannou beats fury ?
Tyson hoping the Usky that fought Daniel shows up.
Tyson could beat ngannou with one hand😂😂😂
Fury  has finally agreed to this now, because he's seen a weakness in Usyk, and doesn't want to fight Zhang.
Great news.
Frank “you can have your strawberries & cream once you’ve eaten your cabbage” Warren.
MUSLIMS hate all KAFFIR’s please don’t travel there
Didnt want to chat shit get zhanged   so opted for the midget who wears his shorts up to his neck lol
it isnt going to happen those are FACTS.
Hi Dean 😂
Load of bollox ! There trying to sell the Nganno fight ! Can see straight through these muppets these days , to little to late , I’m not sure I even want to see Tyson fight again  , lost all respect for the guy as a boxer
This could be the most intriguing fight in history. In one corner, you have a man that you cannot hit to the body, in the other corner, you have a man, who cannot be counted out.  This fight should be titled, WHO, IS CHEATING WHO.
Are the two blokes asking the question stupid?! Warren clearly said the fight will happen between 28th October and 2nd march 2023 and yet one of the dickheads turns around and says 'So it could happen in April then?' 😂😂😂😂 Plonka.
It's all signed but there is no set date? 🤔
Laughing like little kids when Frank won’t let out any information… get some professional people of this show. I mean Darren bent 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Here we go again lol
No date  No venue No rematch  No purse announcement   Nothing gonna stop 🛑 THIS
No date or Venue. Does Bricktop think we are mugs
Tyson Fury is not beyond injuring himself or even purposely failing a drug test IF he feels like he doesn't want to go ahead with it. It really doesn't matter if every contract, date, everything is 100% signed and planned because Fury does not do what he doesn't feel like.
I’m not telling Anyone Anything 😂😂😂😂😂 still a KUNT basically
I think Usyk will win.
The fight ain't done they don't even have a date 😂 luke fury won't do it and usyk  will get the blame , Frank can't even tell you nothing so until the press conference comes nothing is done !! Or signed.
I wonder if the fights off of fury gets beat 🫣🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️
That fight has betting on bet365 for 23rd Dec last 6 months
I can put my mortgage on the fact this fight will fall through. Very smart technique to sell fury vs nganu
If this doesn't happen, its next level of fan manipulation.
I sniff more bullshit! A fight with no date and He's still pushing for a Dubois rematch. If he told me it was raining, I'd have to go and check.
I only  believe it when the ring walk starts.....for now let's hope fury don't KO'd by  francis....😅😅
I’ll believe it after the weigh ins
Get up there my boy he will smash Usyk 💯 haters gunna hate
No one else notice that frank thought he was talking Dean bent..the guys senile and people think he's in control of this massive fight 😂
Never going to happen, heavyweight boxing is soooo boring 😆
Fury has made all the haters look like right mugs!! Scared of Usyk haha
Sounds like a "locked in for december" stiuation.
Usyk & Zhang will KO Fury in 6 rounds OR LESS. It's QUITE clear Fury don't wanna fight EITHER of them...I don't beleive that October has the match people NEED to see...I beleive these promoters are TROLLING right now...
Hope Tyson will loss against Francis and than losses against Usyk  too,Usyk has the most to losse he is the #1 not Tyson
I’ll believe it when they’re both in the ring!
Yass the 4 belts
Fury will will be legacy simple Tyson loves the game and had break family time he’s a winnner Tyson is a legend
Don't believe it until it's been OFFICIALLY cancelled 🙄 We await with baited breath news that talks have broken down due to purse percentages, disagreements over size of the purse, training injuries, whose name appears highest on the billing, what belts are on the line, rematch clauses, etc etc etc
Will be good fight
Believe it after the first round otherwise bs.
All BS AINT GUNNA HAPPEN
Vague at best.
Fury haters - "Tyson Fury will never fight Usyk he's afraid of him"  *Fight gets signed*  Fury haters - "Won't believe it till i see them in the ring together Fury will duck him"  *Fury wins the fight*  Fury haters - "Usyk was just a cruiserweight anyway it was obvious Fury was gonna win but he'll duck AJ"  🤦🤦🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fury will say he broke his hand after the Ngannou fight
I'll believe it when i see it.
Must be a lot of money in it for fury for him to sign up for it
Trust me, this ain’t happening in 2023
YES. Now master technician Usyk can dispatch the Gypsy Queen and become unified undisputed.
If this is signed with a hazy prediction of sometime between Tyson’s next fight and the end of the Riad season in March then how could Usyk V Dubious possibly happen should Daniel’s appeal be successful? Usyk/Dubois December and then Usyk/Fury in March?
Won't believe it until they are walking to the ring
Shut up, shut up shut uuuuuuuuuuup!!!!! Never been so sick of the heavy weight division in my life.
Talksport up Frank's and fury's back side as always
Fury in the past has "signed".. He has agreed terms.. Where, when, how much ect.. He has even been to the press conference!!!  TWICE B4.. AND IT STLL HASN'T FRICKIN HAPPENED!  just sayin Frank 😊✌️
Don’t believe a word of it. They haven’t got the place where it is yet or NOTHING!!!!! He’s LYING!!!!!!
There's no split ffs... the saudia just do deals separately. ...I see frank cant answer any basic questions.  SHOCK.
Thank God! Fury found his balls and signed the contract. Time to prove who are the best. Time to shut up that blabbermouth.
Frank is the Donald Trump of boxing. A lying bullshi*tter.
Believe it when I see it. Ngannou sales that bad are they or are they sick of the criticism? No date I see..
If you believe that you believe anything
😂 so it's 70% fury 30% usyk with a rematch clause.. thinks people are thick
After listening to this interview , it’s because the fury v Francis fight can’t be selling as good as they thought
I think I'll wait for Usyk's side to confirm. Further ill wait for Fury to actually get in the ring, no injuries, no tune ups, no mental breakdowns, no negotiation sabotage, no Nganou rematch, no flip flopping. If this does not happen from.this point Fury and Frank will be an Ultimate joke.
The most important fight in 20 years
Wow. Two professional boxers announce a fight. Everyone acting like the Israeli-Arab peace process has been solved. Boxing today is a complete farce.
Biggest heavyweight fight of the CENTURY? What drugs are you on bricktop??😂 these guys from this era aren’t even JOURNEYMEN in 60/70/80/90s  Biggest fight of the century. That’s as deluded as Bruce Jenner being a lady. Louis v Schmeling 2, Ali vs Frazier 1,2,3, Ali v Foreman, Tyson v Holyfield 1,2, My GOD BRUNO V LEWIS was a contest between 2 better heavyweights.  Frank Ali would literally embarrass and humiliate Fury there wouldn’t even be a fight. He’d NEVER have got a fight with Ali he wouldn’t be top 20 in that era. I’ve never heard such @&£&ocks in my life. World has literally GONE MAD.
One month for now it  get be cancelled  😂
I don’t blv a word that comes out franks mouth any more. There must be reason behind this like people are saying a don’t think the fury v Francis fight is selling
Don’t believe a word of it . Just keeping people sweet with the novelty fight with the kick boxer. Publicity stunt 100%
This is a laughable attempt to salvage Tysons boxing reputation
Frank is a crafty sod; I wonder why he’s announced the Usyk fight before the freak show of Frances vs Tyson?!? Maybe he’s trying to please fans just in case they boycott the freak show.
Lets go!!! Gypsy king gonna smash! Fact.
Fights signed....Great, now lets see if it actually goes ahead. Come on Francis do what you do and defy the odds again.
yeah yeah
Again 🎉
Jeez, Nobody is going to believe that this fight is actually happening, until they are  both climbing into the ring.
Usyk smokes him 😅
Bollocks! 😂 he's just seen the complete negativity towards Fury since this Ngannou fight was announced and he's trying to gain fans back so they actually buy this FARCE fight. Get in the bin Warren u snake He can't say anything about it cuz it's lies.
Fake news until an exact date confirmed.
Excellent news
Fury will hammer Usyk
I bet we see fury v usyk long before we see Joshua v wilder! In fact we will never see Joshua v wilder ,hearn will make up every excuse in the book. Fury will maul and bully usyk and prove he is the best heavyweight to shut his haters up for good and retire on top.
😂 "it's Done" ..you silly naive sods! ✌️
I wonder if Fury will go after Usyk's glass belly?
We all know this has bin goin on in the bak ground slow grind but hey its finally done n the nda still running
You can’t believe anything frank Warren says
Bricktop talks absolute bollocks, dont believe a word this man says, obviously the fight with ngannou isnt generating the interest they hoped,
Frankt boy is all cap ..
Would be funny if Francis connects with a haymaker 😂 slim chance though.
Still won’t happen.
Dean bent 😅😅
They looking past Ngannou......ha ha ha ha, i laugh in chinese!😆😆😆
This fight was always on the cards. The gullible public bought into the media narrative that Fury was running  scared of Usyk. Excellent job in promoting a fight that Fury will not have to step out of his comfort zone to win.
Stop it about "we know he's one of the greatest" just stop it.
Awesome. Come on Fury. Smash the cheating little glass belly middleweight
I have a feeling fury’s gonna take a dive against Ngannou.
some would say uysk made himself look away against daniel so fury will want to fight him if so uysk has a galaxy brain 😂
I’ll believe it when fury gets in the ring
Too bad. I was really looking forward to watching my first boxing match in nearly two decades. I was excited to hear we will finally have an undisputed world champ. Then I heard the fight will be Saudi Arabia. Sorry, but I cannot watch sporting events in a country that executes homosexuals and atheists because of their bronze age fairy tales. Such a disappointment, and a loss of respect for both fighters to even consider participating in that country.
It's locked in like Wilder and AJ
Don't buy the Ngannou fight! This could well be a ploy to sell the Ngannou fight.
I call bullshit on this something will happen
Frank is not giving the date because he knows Usyk would show up for fury’s next fight and then face off in the ring after… What a fight this would be!!! Hopefully we don’t get yet another disappointment😢
Where's all the fury haters now?? Aj is locked in with wilder December 😂😂
Frank confirmed it 🤦‍♂️ not happening.    Probably getting no interest in the sham fight with Francis.     I do want to see the Usyk v Fury fight but there's not a chance it's 100% confirmed
why does every f fight have to be in saudi tho? can we at least have one big match here in the UK... how much money do these greedy people need...
Happy the match is taking place...  Bit Tyson found his pen when he knows about the body shot... Smart man
No firm date, hmmmm
Warren almost slipped up and said the Ngannou fight will be easy.
If Usyk thinks he can box out of range and dance around the ring with fury like he did with AJ he has another thing coming. Even an inexperienced Dubois who isn't even a skilled boxer learned lessons from the AJ fight and knocked him out with a body shot in the fifth round 🤣🤣Cannot wait for this demolition job 🥊👑
Warren is soooo full of it!  90% sure this fight will not happen.
Usyk is gonna get robbed. Screenshot this now.
Il believe it when I see it
If tyson wins his fight, if usyk beats his mandatory, if no injuries, there is a lot of if's in this.
Will get excited when i see them at the presser..
Fury saw the Zhang fight, and decided he is fighting Usyk 😆
Mr contradiction himself 😂😂😂wtf
Won’t happen sadly.
When you're looking at being the Mayor of Morecombe and the biggest family in said town, you need the dollars in the bank. The Furys can't rely on Big John and Tommy.
It seems odd that a fight can be signed without any date, also, it wouldn't surprise me if this is just a tactic to sell the Fury vs Ngannou fight, but I'm actually optimistic, this fight needs to happen
Holy crap, can these pair of numpties, not ask anything other than the bloody date, which Frank repeatedly stated, it's signed for between october through march    🤡🌍
doubt it until we see it
Starting us on this Catherine wheel of BS again
Wow,this many years coming and overdue.
Does anyone seriously think this will actually happen?
It's announced but but...rematch clause with Ngannou...no venue and no proper announcement...so once again an announcement to plug a shite event with a retired MMA fighter... ridiculous and the stupid people acknowledging this lie are dumb beyond belief...normally Fury can't help himself announcing a fight...stop being conned.
Match of the year!!! By far the 2 best craftsmen of this generation, can’t wait
Fury, pretty early and by one or more KOs.
Countdown until Usyk and his team debunk this blag begins…. NOW…😂
Signed with no date and no venture? 😂
Just give me some millions I can talk shit all day long
March or April 🙄🤣😂😂😂
What’s Carl Froch gonna moan about now 😂
Rons bang on it was signed
So it's about as much confirmed as Connor Benn has been found innocent.
The Hearns noses now proper out of joint.
Will the fight still happen if Ngannou manages to pull off an upset😂😂😂
Greedy boxing wankers
It's on, as long as X, Y, and Z doesn't happen, and I mysteriously can't reveal any details about rematch clauses, purse splits, dates etc. (despite never shutting up about them last time), and I know we've said the fights 'on' before, and I know I couldn't properly answer the direct question of whether or not it's guaranteed to happen.....But yeah, the fight is definitely on!!!
Lol...ok.
Won’t happen ever.
FW wants it bcos I an sure the purse is 100m, 70:30 or 60:40 split in favor of Fury. He knows Fury is a ticking time bomb and he needs to max out. Usyk will talk, they are asking the wrong person questions.  For boxing, I want the fight, if Fury comes up with an excuse he might as well retire.
Fury/Usyk has always been the fight..The Saudis have to much money to not fight..PRIZE FIGHTING
Bullshit 😂
What the devil is Riyadh Season?! What a disgrace.
Finally, a proper fight in the heavyweight division. At least the Ngannou farce might serve as light sparring in preparation for the Usyk bout.
This is nothing but PR for Tyson to appease the boxing fans. They know the numbers for N'Gannou aren't going well, so they're trying to get the boxing audience back on Tyson's side by claiming to give them the fight they want. It's almost certainly a nonsense to try and drive more interest for N'Gannou in the short term.
I believe it when I see them in the ring
I'd like announce that I have also signed for this fight!!!! 🤣🤣
Fake news
We need wilder v rag pudding contender on the same night 👌😂😂😂😂😂😂
Once this fight ends Tyson Fury will retire as the undefeated and undisputed 13x Heavyweight Champion of the World (the record most by far): 1x Lineal Champion 3x Ring Magazine Champion 1x WBC Champion 2x WBA Super Champion 2x IBF Champion 2x WBO Champion 2x IBO Champion Bow down to our King 👑
I believe when I actually see it on tv ,unfortunately lost faith in the heavyweight division
Some of the best business tactics you will see in the world. Yes Fury has what boxing fans see as an easy fight but MMA fans don't think the same. Fury wins and brings at least 3 million more eyes or buys to the fight with Usyk. Anyone who doesnt like the Fury v Ngannou fight is oblivious to business and is probably skint and wondering why. Its all a show and no matter what your opinion is you are all putting money/energy into it. My opinion is this was all decided a long time ago just after the first talks between Fury and Usyk started. More eyes more money. Simple.
Nngannou might just bugger up Furys plans
Frank can promise you the fight will be on the boxing season but he hasn’t got the date yet 😂😂😂
I believe a Fury fight is actually happening when the bell goes...
Bet it gets cancelled the 🦆king 🤔
how many times did theses muppets ask for the date
Fight definitely happening and has been signed but split percentage can't be mentioned? Think people need to wake up a bit and not shoot their loads early. Frank said it was definitely happening the last time and look what happened.
Nigganu is crazy
His dads step in and told fury how it is
Rubbish fight.  Nobody is buying Franks gimmicks
Whatever
done but no date?
I'll see it when I believe it
Hip hip hooray if you believe it 🙄💪
Dear Santa I’m very excited. Please please please let this fight happen. I’m not taking the pee, please let it happen
Massive pr stunt to sell more ppv’s. Pair of scumbags Fury and Warren
And more Bullshit.
Untill i see fury walking to the ring i won't hold my breath
Bullshit
Finally 🥊 until Fury finds a way out of it 😂
The meltdowns all the fury haters are gonna have😂😂
Nah don’t believe it load of shit, it was only yesterday fury came out and said he’s not fighting Usyk cause he’s this n that bla bla bla.. now a day later it’s signed. Clearly doing it cause they know fury n Nganouu is gonna flop cause no one gives a shit about exhibition fights. not to mention he just said he’s appealing the triple knees fight with Usyk still.
Usyk has week body no doubt
Bullshit.
Pleased the fight been announced however has the Fury VS Ngannou  result already been predicted/fixed?
It’s done… apart from a venue and date lmao
Dont fall for this shite again. No date No venue.
Fury Vs Usyk stylistically will be a terrible fight. Only because of Undisputed is it interesting at all
I don't think anybody really cares until they both step into the ring together.
The look at 10:18 between the two that says 'he's talking a load of bollocks' and Frank's desperate response at 10:23 'not more excited than me!'. Wouldn't that be blindingly obvious if he felt in his heart it was ACTUALLY going ahead?
I'll believe it when they climb through the ropes.
I won't believe it's happening until the bell goes.
Easy fight, pts win for Fury.
Let's go 💥💥💥💥💥
Ok Bricktop, ill believe it when i see it 🙄
Makes me laugh all the believe it when i see it crew😂😂  They will be getting paid a small fortune so its gonna happen no doubt. Afterall why do you think it got postponed??
Let’s be honest. Who cares. Boxing is a complete joke these days. Usyk v Fury should have happened a long time ago. I just hope Fury gets knocked out in his next fight and at this weight it can happen. Getting rid of Fury will help the heavyweight division move forward rather than stagnate.
this fight is signed as fury knows from the joyce fight that usyk is weak on the body, the cruizerweight will get toyed with and then punished hard,  cannot wait !
Eggy “peds” gurn CRYING 😅
5 belts
Talk sports are just funny you wanted the fight the fight is done now you talking about Tyson losing to ngannou shut up
Publicity stunt to raise profile of the pathetic UFC fight
he s not goat. The 90's were better
Wait for idiots to come out ranting
Yeah frank so was tyson v Joshua signed and look what happened.
As usual Whosick will RUN again!   .........
1000% its because the Ngannou fight aint selling. This fight will not happen, after the fight. Fury will get injured or retire
Fight was always happening usyk would only fight in Saudi when will you thick people have a day off😂
I know…let’s pretend fury v Usyk is signed to try and get people to watch this shit show of Fury v man that has never boxed. No date, No venue but it’s definitely happening 🥴 after the ngannou “fight” Fury will be asked when the fight is..Fury will say he doesn’t have a date but Usyk will get it eventually…then the fight will be cancelled rinse and repeat.
Id like to hear usyk's team  i trust them more.
Even if I see it happen I'll only half believe it. Not gonna happen imo.
Absolute bollocks, I'll start to get my hopes up when i see a date, venue etc.  And I'll actually believe its happening when i see them in the ring
Yep more bullshit.
He’s full of shit 😂 always has been and always will be, think about how many times he’s said a fight is done 😂 and how many times did he mention this farce he’s involved in 😂 it’s a ploy to promote that end off, I’m past caring about anything fury does or doesn’t do, completely ruined any respect I had for him and I know it won’t mean anything to him but it is what it is and I sincerely hope he gets smashed everywhere
Let's Go Fury shut down the haters and show them you're the greatest of your generation
Tyson fury cunning coward match fixing with francis ngannu....in this fight Tyson fury will get injury so fight will stopped...so usyk fight also stopped....great escape plan by Tyson fury cunning coward
I believe it when I see it.
Who else is bored of this shit....I like fury, the guy is a proper boxer, but stop messing  around and get it done....you've made your money, you tell everyone its all about the fans....then give the fans what they want and fight the guy,
Honestly frank is so full of shite that I wouldn't be surprised if all this is nothing more than a ploy to build up the Francis fight, basically upping the stakes and making it more important than it actually is
Everyone is over Fury's bullshit,so lack of any interest in his fights is on him
I don't trust Warren and Fury. I believe it when I see it. No venue, no date...come on...
Hopefully it's ngannu fighting usyk for title nxt year that will be fukin hilarious 😂😂
I'll believe it when it happens
What a couple of absolute bell ends for presenters.
I think usyk and fury  were going back and forth simply to hype up this fight, I think they knew it all along😂
fury still lost all his fans
Me bollox. The knacker ain't fighting usyk.
Frank is  lying, even him don't believe himself
So many haters who spoke of ducking for months just because they’re naive and believe everything boxers or promoters ( professional liars ) say! And now it’s signed, morons talk shit again! What a world we live in!
some ppl need to see a million dollars before they can believe it exists lmao 😂
Hasn't this been said before. How confirmed is it exactly.
The fight had to happen ! Biggest fight for the heavyweight!  Both will earn £££££££ .. Usyk earnt £60 million in his career and £58 million in his last few fights !
Lmaooo no Frank, there’s no fight cos there isn’t even a date or venue, they agreed to fight years ago you’re just regurgitating bollocks man
The best Christmas ever if it happens on 23rd Dec!!! 🎄
We have been down this road many many times before. The lack of details of Frank is worrying. I'll believe it when I see it
these 2  ask some really silly basic questions. are they journalists. the white guy isn't the sharpest tool in the box is he
2 days before what great fight before Christmas
There's one born every minute.
"low blow" black supports black , needs glasses
Huh? Rematch and fury? This guys waffling
That fight is not happening.
Announcing a fight that not for another thirteen months seems a bit shifty to me
Andy - listen to what Frank is saying and stop asking stupid questions.
Usyk promotors confirm its happening
Hearn and Warren selling out to the Saudi MONEY!
😂😂😂😂😂😂. Yer right 😂
About time
It won’t happen!
The Big, Hugely Big Gypsy King will destroy the Cruiserweight Usyk.
Believe it when the standing in the ring
Does not sound like it is all signed off if you have not got a year let alone a month or week. This is just hype and a sorry attempt to boost up the Nganou  sham
Fury going to make a killing this year. Well deserved too👏
Hopefully Usyk's mandatories don't get called...
Split is irrelevant.. So unfair then 🤦‍♂️
Fury wont fight him hes only fought 3 world champions in his gljm boring career in klitchko and wilder twice usyk will dance n box his silly head off
1..Frank promises this to raise sales for the Ngannou fight 2..Frank/Fury do a Uturn on this after the Ngannou fight and blame it on Usyk.
"I can't believe that it's happening but it is," said Usyk's promoter Alexander Krassyuk. “Difficult to express my admiration for being part of the biggest heavyweight fight of the century. Respect to Tyson for his courage."  Source: Sky Sports News  Confirmation from Usyk’s side which alleviates cancellation fears somewhat. Date, venue etc. confirmed after the Ngannou fight?
All these dumbass questions 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
happen because of pure pressure
Unfortunately fury is involved so nothing is a guarantee
The fight we all been waiting for,can’t wait
Believe it when i see it
Heard it all before
I dont believe a word
Not surprised how quickly Fury signed after watching Usyk vs Dubois. Definitely ducked Usyk the first time.
💤
Shocking how feeble minded Fury fans are so 100% behind Fury even though he has not fought a real opponent in many years,has ducked everyone with a pulse and now fighting a guy that has never been inside a boxing ring Wow delusional fools one and all.
Time to stick a fork in the orc
Still not buying the ngannou fight, frank lol! 😂
I'll believe it when the bell rings!
Snake 🐍 oil frank Warren  trying to generate sales for fury's fight  that nobody wants to watch by pretending uysk  is next,  Fury and frank do it before every Fury fight  and they use talksport  again and again to hype  🥊  Zhang and Fury on same side but  he's distracting everyone..  Frank and Fury a scam
All those clowns saying Tyson fury Ducking Usyk must feel like right bellends 😂😂😂😂😂
Believe it when the first bell rings
This has to be a big joke. Why even announce it one month before Fury vs Francis when the few people caring about this exhibition match now are gonna avoid it?!? Anyway, don't believe anything until a proper press conference has been made with both Fury and Usyk during a face off and etc...
Go watch past interviews with Frank. He can never remember the names of the Saudi people involved 😂
I’ll believe it when I see it happen …
Its because they cant sell the ngannou fight what a scam
well done frank
It's almost like if there was anything in his system that was used to get him back on track is fully out of his system by the time he has an actually boxing match
Definitely lies
i'll believe it when they are both in the ring, remember fury said the fight between him and aj was all done (pre wilder 3). Which Goldstein fobbed off when a caller pointed that out. He was signed to fight wlad rematch then came out with his 'dont care about the titles' rant then quit the sport....said a few similar things recently too. Bet this was only announced due to the reaction fans have given him for the freakshow with Ngannou. It wont happen
The split is 90 10 to fury lol
Tyson yesterday, said he would never fight AJ or Usyk??? And that he didn't need too, no one seems to picked up on this....
The klitchco fight was so boring. They looked like they could go 10 more rounds. Little slap punches
All these trolls on this thread are really wishing the fight doesnt happen because it makes them look like assholes. Theyre Fury haters.
Will done frank
The fella on the right loves hypothetical questions. The clown.
Funny, yesterday Fury was saying he wouldn't fight him as he's a middleweight bum. And of course this will be in the desert, where no real fans can get to easily.
It’s still really really important that we boycott the Fury Ngannou bout. We’ve been here before: fights announced that do not happen. This is just ploy to sell the Ngannou bout that isn’t selling.
Probably bullshit thers more chance of ngannou rematchs
Fury is not even close to being the best ever. His resume is way too light
He knows that the wba wont give him the rematch no chance
WELL DONE
Maybe Frank gets AJ on undercard first fight of the night
Yeeeeeees at last we've been waiting for this news  I can't wait to see it live
When usyk gives his next opponent  a boxing lesson , then fury will get injured or else come up with the depression excuse like he did with the klitchko rematch.  Stay away from the wild boar meat gypsy queen. Clearly nobody was buying tickets for the ngannou money grab.
When's the date where's the venue? Until then there is no fight.
Yesssssss❤ Finally a proper fight
So Frank is telling us there is no date or venue? I thought that was a sticking point for him???
The biggest heavyweight fight since Lewis v Holyfield and Hearn and AJ be watching at home! 😂
Everyone saying fury was dodging usyk. Fury knows what he is doing . He is a very clever businessman and fighter. I cannot wait .
Sure frank was saying Zang would beat Usyk yesterday 😅
THERE YOU GO READ THE COMMENTS...NO ONE BELIEVES A WORD OF IT...we have been here before..there is no word from the main man uysk or his team so dont believe a word of it..fury is over 300lbs and would need 6 months to shift the weight hes carrying..
No doubt tyson is number 1. But usyk would be only his 3rd top 10 fighter, possibly even top 15 dwpends who you ask. Pretty poor and definitely not an all time great. Hope the fight does happen though.  Never know with tyson till hes in the ring.
Did he called Darren “Dean”? 😂😂
OMG!!!  Finally Fury has signed. Looking forward to it. I've been slating Fury for a while now, but fair play to him finally!!
Where are the divs saying Fury was afraid now? Fury will school the rabbit.
Bulls..t! Warren is just as full of hot air as Fury and his idiot father
No date and no venue and therefore no contract. Simple as that really.
Frank warrens favourite phrase it’s going to happen never does .
It’s fake news.. it’s to boost sales for fury fight next October .. ibf already set mandatory .. just anther scam.. to boost publicity
So much for all the people saying fury ducking uysk
Sweepstake on how many days before the fight fury will pull out on
So obvious and cynical playing this card now to try and legitimise the farce coming up, trying to get people on  board because they think a real fight is happening  after, which it probably won't anyway
Tyson 'Diva Queen' Fury, needs more money for shoes and handbags
Biggery exactly
Bullshit
Frank bla bla Warren.......its all about fury v naganno the big circus 🎪 fight in Saudis signed with no dates ....!?
The purse isn’t irrelevant as usyk holds the most belts . He won’t answer because he doesn’t know . He’s probably lying for a change .
You will see now all of you that said Fury was ducking hahah he will show you all this fight will be over in just a couple of rounds
Finally, sick of Usyk & that idiot Krassuk. End him badly. No rematch please 🙏
More bollocks frank
Can't tell anyone the date
I knew fury would come and clear all the belts up, he will muller usyk to the body like a savage , usyk will be rolling about like a sausage again 😂
Convienent announced on same day as AJ v Wilder is cancelled
Fury: Do we do enough, well I didn’t shut up about it”.  Warren only makes game changing fights”
This fight isnt on until the bell rings
Frank: Yeah, on retrospect, i could see how that punch could be considered low
there is no way tyson fury is fighting uysk because we have been here before remember...fury may have signed a contract but until uysk signs the same agreement its a load of bull...fury simply wont be able to get under 300lbs..hes 24 stone at least and fights ngannau in 4 weeks..do people seriously believe fury will fight uysk 8 weeks after ngannau..this is just a load of tripe im afraid.
Don't believe a word until they're standing opposite each other with a ref and 3 judges present...
And about time 🎉
This fight is NOT signed. Frank only says it will happen but that is not - is signed! He refused to say that it is signed. For whoever knows english ppl that should be enough. They might have shaken hands, confirmed part of the details. BUT the Nganu fight is in between and Frank said that Fury needs to win and look good. (then he realized and switched the story)  AND IF IS NOT SIGNED - IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!!!   Fury is just a bs
Remember when tyson fury and Anthony joshua was "confirmed" I smell bullshit
They're saying this to boost sales for the Ngannou fight!! I dare them to get Usyk's manager on the phone 😏
He does this before every irrelevant fight he has. He'll pull out over money as soon as the ngannou fight it over with
If true? Fury will pull out yet again!
The winner will declare Jesus is lord in Saudi Arabia at Christmas 😀
How many times we heard this rubbish with big fights and it never happens. Don’t be announcing a fight to promote the current fight that no one cares about. 😴
No information or details wonder why frank either bull💩 or its all in furys favour
I will believe it when I see it  !  Fury has demanded 90%
Fury knew this had to happen to save hes reputation.
Anyone who thought this fight was never happening probably wears jellybean sandals and dungarees
I call your BS with no date, and rise you 70:30
It’s about as done as AJ vs Wilder , it’s locked in 😂😂😂🥊🥊🥊
I got to 4:41 before I had to switch waffing old frank off. New personal best.
I think AJ and Wilder are on the undercard
Fury wasted about about 2 years of negotiations just so he could earn an extra £1. Usyk knew the WBC would never strip him so he gave in and took a crap deal just to get the belt. 😂😂😂😂
Fury will jab, work the body and KO the Ukrainian 'hero' Usyk easy.
So yet again fury lied to us all saying he had NO intention of fighting usyk ( he’s not relevant, he’s a nobody ) that what he said , and now the biggest contradiction EVER by the gypsy 🥊🥊🥊he’s a joke , and I bet it  doesn’t happen
Frank: it'll happen on April 1st. 😂
It's a yuge, yuge, yuge event
Usyk didn’t look that great against dubios but for frank to come on and tell you nothing means exactly that nothing what a joke and a waste of aire time he’s great at talking twaddle
C'mon Belly! Slay the buck tooth rabbit and bring the scalp back to Morecambe! Dubois nearly did it himself! (He arguably did)
Frank Warren is a proper lad lol 😂
I will believe it when the bell goes for the first round.
Like I said Fury will brutalise Usyk before the end 🥊 👑 Fury 🥊
I'll be shocked if fury loses the Ngannou fight.... absolutely shocked.Fury has got no excuse.
We’ve been here many many times before and Fury still ducked it. They don’t even have a date in place. 😂😂😂😂 🦆🦆🦆🦆 This should have happened years ago.
Heard it all a million times before. I await the interview asking "So, Frank! What happened? I thought the deal was signed off" 😂
LOL 😂 If Frank pulls this off, he could arguably be in his second prime like Bernard Hopkins lmfao 🤣 I thought his career was over in the 90’s, but now 30 years later he is putting a MASSIVE UNDISPUTED HEAVYWEIGHT BOXING 🥊 FIGHT ON!!  lol 😆 you can’t make this up
6 world title fights doesn't make a ' best ever'
Not all super heroes wear capes and fly around some wear expensive tailored suits and do shoulder roles, thank you for this gift uncle Frank.
This is all BS hype, Usyk already accepted the 30% before. They don’t even have a date in place. I won’t be in the slightest bit surprised if Fury still ducks it. We’ve heard it before that “the fight is on” from frogman’s gob himself! 😂😂😂😂
“The contract is irrelevant, it doesn’t matter, I don’t want to talk about it, we don’t have a date, Tyson needs to get through the Ngannou fight then we’ll see what happens” - Frank Warren there alleviating fears that he’s talking poppycock again.
boring now . if the fight hapens it should be  a tener for all the mesing around  the fans have had .   will look forward to it if and when at this stage why is everbody geting exited . think ill get back to my jigsaw
BREAKING NEWS!!!!!! Fury is retiring on the 1st of December 😂😂
Saudi money calls the shot and only they could of put this fight on!
The WBA have not got back because they can't stop laughing probably. I don't believe bricktop no more.
I can't keep up with this guys constant changing his story
🎉🎉🎉🎉🤳🤳🤳🤳🤳🤳🤳🤳🤳🤳🍞
unfortunately usyk can win\draw by points, watching him boxing is so annoying, he's jumping all the time like a little girl with a jump rope, of course it's good but only when you can punch hard and land your punches, which is not usyk's feature
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
At last!!!! I can be a Fury fan again, I thought he was avoiding Usyk and now it's on. Hopefully Tyson will be Undisputed Champion of the WORLD!!!!
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
It’s about time
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh booooooooommmmmmm 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Biggest heavyweight fight this century 😂. I think Frank means decade.
Frank... it's only your job, guy.
The fights on, no date, no purse, no rematch clause. Let’s hope they can actually fight
I thought ngannou v fury had a rematch clause
Regardless if Twas legal or not he popped that body shot, it was one of the best shots I’ve ever seen and heard!
Interesting possibility. Let's hear from Usyk. Does he agree that everything is signed, or are there other conditions precedent beyond that Fury has to win his forthcoming fight free of injury and the actual date and actual venue are not yet fixed?
no one wants this fight, the fight everyone wants is jake paul v fury and then jake paul v usyk and after that we can have the big one jake paul v ksi for the true undisputed heavy weight champion anything else is just filler
Why People who do not know anything about boxing are interviewing Frank. They keep repeating the same question over and over again.
Frank is on good terms with these boys so this time it has 2 but im not sure
Can't wait for this to fall apart, it's been a while since we've seen a big fight fall through /s
DONT BELIVE A WORD! Until they’re stood facing each other in the ring!
Fury hater’s cry some more
As likely to happen as  Mayweather canelo 2
Undistuped. About bloody time. Well done Frankie boy. Don't let the boxing fraternity down 🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊😁🥊
👑 FURY
Usyk would fight anywhere . Tysons greed makes it happen in saudi .
Confirmed. So when is it? Sometime within a 5mth window?
The IBF are gonna f this up with mandatory
I'll believe it when I see it
We’ve been here before, Fury ducked the Klitschko rematch after it was announced.
Ah, this old tune. Fool me once.
Eddie Hearn? How do you feel about this great blockbuster?
I said months ago Fury is going to come out with a fake arsed injury after the NaGoGo circus and I'm sticking by it.
Knew this was going to happen. Waiting on Saudi money
I will believe it when the winners hand is raised 😂
Not happening this year 😂😂😂
A fight with no date and 6 months to buy more time……..awesome 😂
Hope Usyk doesn't bottle it again.....
I'm pretty neutral about the Saudis taking over football, but for boxing, we have to agree - they are good for the sport
Bollox it is. Fury will pull out.
A contract without a set date is not binding. Which contract says 23 dec or sometime in January???? What does that mean???  It can’t be don’t without a concrete date
We'll see
300 punches a fight fatty fury v 800 punches per fight usyk...only 1 winner and its not the fat dinner lady
Old Bricktop's done it again
Very odd contract supposedly signed without a date. I agree to fight you sometime between october and march 🤔
Not a very convincing interview with Warren. Don’t be conned by Queensbury. No signed match yet until date is confirmed.
Gypsy Gold!
thank the Lord it's signed..
This is absolute Clickbait bullshit what he means is they have agreed terms. No contracts have been signed. Tyson has a fight coming up. What is he going to do if he gets tuned or suffers a severe cut so Frank is talking out of his arse and talkSPORT should not be click baiting their audience like this
Can we just take a minute to thank Eddie, who only a few days ago, urged Tyson to think about his legacy and make the fight.
Finally Fury read my comment, otherwise it never would've happened
Confirmed as a title, then followed by possibly & rumoured.....
Tyson might get decked by big guy yet.
About F’in time!
Frank is sharper than these 2 knit wits can they hear anything
Locked in for dec , jan , Feb , march koogz
Yes great, provided Mr Fury gets past Francis
So the Saudis got that oil money out and put it to good use there going to make over a billion on this fight and I say Tyson fury is getting over 300 million of that also usyk about 50 mill
Isnt it time we gave Fury just an ounce of respect and an apology!
Where's all the Fury haters at who was saying Fury is scared? You're all clueless and shouldn't be in boxing. Fury is going to knock Usyk out. Just you wait and see.
Poor old eddie, small hall promoter frank involved in 1 of the biggest fights ever 😂
All you Fury haters sit down and take some humble pie all you Fury hating hypocrites will be sayin well he should have fought him earlier well it's happening now stop complaining I bet all of you are gonna pay to see the fight 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
No date, no venue, no fight.
Fury 100% would have seen the Dubois fight and not been impressed by Usyk for this to have been agreed out of the blue like this. I still won't believe it until I see it though.
If this is true this a absolutely fantastic news it’s what boxing needs
Usyk for the win. Never been so confident 🥊 🥊 🥇
Who is Dean? 😂😂😂
Can’t believe a word Warren or Fury say. No date, no split details, no rematch info.
Very odd way to announce “a fight with no date”.
Sounds good, lets hope Fury don't duck it up!
Blah blah blah. I literally only believe it when they're in the ring. There are still so many ifs and buts. Venue and date and the ngannou fight. Then you have the purse split and the size of that purse. Just can't beleive it.
I don't believe it. Fury will pull out of the fight.
Thank you Frank!!!
Literally couldn't give a shite!.. no doubt everyone will be up in arms when they announce the venue being in Saudi Arabia 😂
Im a Tyson Fury fan - but lets be fair... Tyson has beaten Wilder, Klitschko and Whyte - they are the three names... AJ has beaten Klitschko, Whyte and if he beats Wilder (if they fight) then their record are the same.. Them two have to fight at some point!
££££
Seeing will be believing
Anyone who was hatin on fury is a muppet.
Until they get in the ring I don’t believe a word
So much for the big man ducking him 😂😂😂🤑🤑
Probably just trying to get people to watch the shit show
This lot at Talk sport are a little dense in the head
So it’s signed to happen in a 6 month window 😂
Calling it now won't happen
Its signed and on  but it will happen between October 28th and 2nd march 🤦‍♂️ longer this drags on more chance IBF calls the mandatory just announce a date get the fight officially on stop fucking about
Woooooo
The Gypsy King gunna be throwing egg in all the fickle boxing fans faces again! After he smashes up Usyk they will say he beat a middleweight LOL!!
No 1 right now is good enough to match fury. Fury could hack with prime generations of boxers and this generation is just big but not very talented. Fury is a dick but he’s really skilful
From Frank said it depends what happens with this exhibition fight you know it's bulls#!t.. why would anything in that exhibition fight with no titles or belts on the line determine if the Undisputed fight goes ahead or not.. especially if contracts have already been signed and  according to Frank an injury wouldn't stop it from going ahead
Fury played you all and in the meantime he gets paid 40 to 50 million quid for the easiest fiight of his career
I'll believe it when I see both in the ring with the ref in the middle
Signed with no date or venue 😂 ……watch Ngannou get lucky and chin Fury 😂
Hearn will be fuming 😅😅😅😅
Let's get Zhang on the undercard
Signed but no date wonder why they haven't waited till after the tyson next circus fight to announce 🤔 maybe to try get the fans back on side 😂
Lies 😂😂😂😂
Now Fury just needs to stay off the coke
As much as Frank annoys the hell out of me, I have to agree that none of the split and other details be discussed at all. Let’s see in official announcement and a press conference, and let’s see the biggest fight of all time!
Now that it is signed, i actually agree with Frank that purse splits are irrelevant. FINALLY!!!
Fingers crossed for this 🙏
Gonna stop saying foight?
Of course it is 🤣. This is to stall the backlash against Fury so he can sell the Ngannou fight. I'd bet my house to anyone willing that this doesn't happen.
Fight should have already happned. Fury fighting Francis is a joke, but at keast its happening. I hope Usyk gives him a bixing lesson.
Fury will cancel the fight because  A: injury  B: Another reason
😂😂😂😂 of course it has ,frank
Usyk is gonna get dominated
Thought Fury was ‘ducking’ him anti Fury fellas?!  You have ALL GONE VERY VERY QUIET haven’t you all?!
Hi dean hi Andy lol 😂😂😂 Darens face when he said dean 😂
Eddie Hearn is punching the air right now 😂
All the folk saying Fury ducked he's this he's that 😂 he's a disgrace..... this was always happening, folk still saying believe it when they see it.... of course it's happening why do you think Usyk signed with skill challenge...... to guarantee a bag full of money and no doubt more than what he would of got at Wembley earlier in the year. This fight is happening and Fury beats Usyk job done.
That's why there's no wilder vs AJ they can't afford both lol
I don't believe it
about time!
Fury hasn't beaten Ngannou yet
way too short notice for a generational fight like this, should be at least summer 2024
i said this fight would happen at end of this year.its all been hyped up to this point of it happening .
Now I understand why the Saudis couldn’t do Wilder Joshua, whatever amount that Fury demanded used up all the budget 😂
Saudi again, absolutely no atmosphere
Your daft if you take this at 100% . Given the bad feedback from the fans and public , it's a little bit good timing coming up to his fight with UFC star .   It's all about selling his next fight .   I hope I'm wrong , but I'm guessing this is just bs to get fans back on side before his next fight
Queensbury on top as usual
Everyone clowning and bashing Fury now look like big idiots, lol, what a waste of energy you all had over the last few months, so many wasted conversations for you tools.
Just a shame AJs bottled wilder othwise cud have had that fight on the same date
So I'll keep my ppv money for this Fury Usyk fight now Frank. Cheers
Trying to see PPV for his bum fight
No date no venue and it's signed 😅😂😂😂 clowns
Frank’s not getting into any of the finer details because plain and simply it’s Bullshit!
All the Fury hating Rematch-room casuals who have spent the every day of the last month crying about Fury... Are currently crying harder and circle jerking each other for comfort    It only gets worse for them, too, as Fury will clatter & KO their new HERo Usyk in less than 5 rounds 😂😂
Fury been bullied into taking this fight
fury vs ngannou 2 after a draw
Bollocks can’t give a date load of shit
So there is no date or venue confirmed. More BS coming out  of camp Fury!!
Heard it all before 😴💤😴💤
WE finally FORCED THE MUPPET TO TAKE THE FIGHT.
The winner of tgis fight is the public . This is what we wanted to see well done we all cant wait
Fury vs Usyk CONFIRMED with contracts SIGNED but there's no date, no venue and it depends what happens in this Nganno fight 🙄🤣 whatever Frank, we'll believe it when we see it.
BULLSHIT !!!
At last 🙌 "it's on but I can't tell you any information." Well I believe him.
Alot can happen before then to many ifs and buts along time to wait we will see 🙏
Yawn
See if Fury listened to the fans, he would be like 50 mill worst off, Tyson don’t dance to anyone’s tune for his own
👑 fury rent free
When FURY beat's USYK all the hater's will have to admit he's the greatest of this era
But why is Warren making this fight... he said 'at a minimum we'll get them to run Usyk v Dubois back'... since he is 100% confident they'll rule it was a legal punch.
If Tyson “Roadrunner” Fury will go back to Number One if he beat SpeedyGonUsyk 🥊🎖️
Won't believe it until it happens!
If this fight actually happens that’s great. That must be the reason we are also hearing today that Joshua vs Wilder isn’t happening in Saudi Arabia Winter / Spring, because they are investing in the undisputed for now.
Wont believe it until fury is in the ring with him😂😂
Come on FRANK, all the fury hater's hiding.
I for one shan't be holding my breath...
Wot like the wilder arbitration want get in the way with aj fury 😂 B.s it want happen its to sell fury francis
Its happening in saudi cause its all about the money. Fury only signed  because he said he wants to top FORBES
Team Usyk must have had something in their hands against Fury. Seriously. Fury would never take the fight :D whatever happened... Im super excited and Usyk all the way!
Not bad for a small hall promoter
Who cares about the rematch clause  or splits ,fight is on ,its a decent fight
Walk in park for gypsy king
Awkward for anyone saying Fury ducked him. And will be even more awkward when they see how easy hell deal with Usyk 🫅🐐
Rubbish! Just fury trying to drum up interest in his panto coming up!
I’m assuming this is just bullshit anyway. 😂
So march 24 then push it back to 2025 😅
Fury won’t fight no way
Franks such a wanker. He just said fury & usyk is the biggest fight.  It was only last week that fury vs nghanou was the biggest fight. Is this fight really booked. I wouldn't trust a bloody word frank says
Frank, 6 months ago, Saudi is killing boxing.. Now, Have more cash, thank you your highness..
What some dumb azz question's these two idiots asking. It will be between October and march and they ask will it be April my god 🤣
There wouldn't be a split! The Saudis will have done a deal individually with each fighter. Fury has simply behaved himself this time and not asked for more money than what was in the entire pot! 🤣
Ball park figure is one billion pounds
Frank Warren the main man we’ve got what we’ve all been crowing about . Fair play to Fury as well all the haters can have a chill now 🥊
Something doesn't ring true about this. I think Usyk may have been tricked into signing for a fight that Futry can get out of.
Dont hold your breathe
Where has everyone gone saying fury was ducking please show yourselfs clowns
This will be news when the fight gets closer. Until then it's just words that can change from Fury's side.
IM FEEL. IM VERY FEEL
Saudi Arabia is now the home for top class boxing
WHO WINS BETWEEN TYSON FURY & OLEKSANDR USYK? 🤔🔥
"Hi Frank, how are you mate" Frank: I'm sorry, I can't say.
Yes🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
All it took was an extra zero on his purse fee.
Fury now has his chance for legacy
About blooming time !
It'll never happen
FURY THE GOAT
Uysk gonna teach Greedy belly a lesson
Is he saying this because nobody is buying Fury vs Ngannou??
I’ll believe it when they walk through the ropes, the referee says “keep your shots above here” (points at the body protector), then they both touch gloves
I don’t believe it till I see it
Hatman eat your words
Absolutely marvellous news
Greedy bellys hand has been forced. He had no choice due to public pressure.
I called this, i knew Fury would get a go to snatch all 4 belts from Usyk once he finished with Francis. He obviously cares about money, having Undisputed belts raises his price through the roof. Its a no brainer he just wanted to milk the hype
Fury Signed a fight with AJ and went online to confirm it, shouting that its all down to the Saudis blablabla. Then later cancelled the fight saying he's contracted to Wilder. Come on people, see beyond the BS 😅😅😅
Half the Internet boxing community just dropped. Matchroom casuals gone. Sporting icons just lost half his subscribers 😂
I couldn't care less about all the Fury haters, they make me laugh my head off with their sad, bitter comments. knowing the Fury's haunt thier everday life and dreams is hilarious, it's his traitorous fans that got to me the last year, i bet they'll be back like they never left the unloyal gooses.
Bullshit. Unfortunately that fight will never happen. Talk is cheap without action.
ABOUT FFING TIME. But still no date 😂
Hope Usk smashes him  now after Tysons pantomime Antics with a MMA fighter
BOYCOTT FURY v NGANNOU!🚫 Kill the profits that destroy boxing!💸 Like, copy, paste, post. ✅ THE MOVEMENT IS HERE, IT’S REAL!!🪧
Were all the peep saying fury bottling it
I've heard this before, don't believe it until both men are in the ring.
I'll believe it when i see them in the ring ⚠️
Dont belive it untill they are in the ring face to belly
This is all lies, they just want you to buy the Circus fight he is having with Nganoou and then he will bring up some crap about injury and cancel the Usyk fight. Fury just said he isn't fighting Usyk on numerous occasions. Smart people can see behind the BS. That's why he doesn't want to answer questions. Guilty conscience 😅😅😅
Hate him or love him Fury will absolutely smash Usyk.
Doesnt matter now...Fury's reputation is in ruins....tosser
Fury haters are stunned and SILENT 😂
BuT FuRy'S DuCkInG HiM
All these comments crying about fury haters obviously aren’t big boxing fans as people only criticise fury because they want the big fights, the casuals will believe anything fury says
This was pencilled in all along both just wanted to make a few quid before it
people all saying Fury was ducking, I knew it was all about the money. haters just gonna hate. your seetyson again prove he is the best.
😂😂😂😂 well well well. All the haters have now is “I’ll believe it when they are In the ring” then fury smashes him and they become fans of fury.
What a year for boxing in 2023.. Davis vs Garcia. Spence vs crawford. Haney vs Lomachenko & Prograis. Inoue vs fulton. Teo vs Taylor. Benavidez vs plant. Bam vs edwards. Canelo vs charlo.Fury vs Usyk. What a year and this should be the standard going forward that these big fights can be and should be made in the sport.
Fucking bricktop , loving this 😊
It's done, but I can't tell you if there's a rematch clause, or when exactly it will be...but it's done...
Weak Belly going down to China town 🕳️🕳️🕳️⬇️⬇️⬇️
Where are the Fury haters?????? What you saying??? Usyk is the last hope for certain people hahaha
Where’s matchroom icons at
Hmmm wonder how much hergovic got for stepping aside
Undisputed is signed and the Matchroom fundamentalists HATE it
Until there in the ring I won’t get my hopes up
This fight isnt happening cant believe u clowns think its gonna happen haha its all to hype up queen furys joke of fight coming up next lol
Fury after seeing Usyk quit against Daniel said let me get my hands on him now !
Not believing anything yet.
Sure he said the same about April 2023 🤷🏼‍♂️    Or are they just saying this to get everyone off furys back and take a bit of interest in the mma fighter he's boxing
so its happening in the middle east wow no one saw that coming
Fury haters in the mud 🤣🤣🤣
Big up Propa Boxing! Looking forward to your video about this!
Be funny if Francis knocks out fury now 😂
The Matchroom mongs are absolutely freaking out right now. Sporting Icons is in hiding.😂
Nobody is bothered about fury no more....the wbc should be stripping him...end of.
Yeah yeah whatever
This is how to sell a Fury fight against an MMA with 0 boxing experience. 😂😂 To tell the undisputed fight is happening  soon after 🤣.
I thought Fury is ducking Usyk... 😂😂😂 strip him.. strip him 😂😂
Haters are absolutely fuming 😂  Undisputed is happening
I'll believe it when i see it.
Don't care anymore.
WHERE ARE THE FURY HATERS?
Battle of the greedy belly vs white rabbit 😂🤣🔥
Bosh!
