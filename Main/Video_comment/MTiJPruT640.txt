THE UK IS GETTING MORE STORMS BECUASE A JET STREAM THAT PUSHES THE STORMS HERE
YEAH THOSE STORMS WERE HORRIBOE
Literally went above me
I came here bc stupid storm Eunice stupid stupid storm annoying and BIG sleep disrupter
When is the next storm? .. i’m looking forward to it😃
Suuuuuuuuuu
It’s today
If our electric goes off we have a gassstove
Could this be as bad as the 1987 one?
Today weather is not that bad  in Glasgow  Scotland
damn thats worrying and all but I dont remember asking
Thankfully, I shall be isolating a lot.
still think its stupid that they name them
Its so windy when i put the bins out i ended up being blown into the nearest pub 🙃
The southern snowflakes won't be able to copy with a bit of wind.
I’m still gonna have to go to school i bet
My mum said we are netting a friend in park on Friday and I say the warning say the storm will pass over the town I live in
I has had a warming text in case off power cuts on Friday I has touch blackets ready be prepared people
Change the presenter his useless
Definitely ‘ Calm before the Storm’ saying is apt here … 😬
Gonna be a busy week for me! Got my saws on the ready for Dudley and Eunice. I really hope they don’t cause too much damage. I’m concerned about Eunice, that one looks bad.
Got sick already from the cold yesterday will have to brace for these storms and be careful
Living in an old mobile home and really looking forward to this😳
Well here in the South West near Bath and it’s really bad. The wind is doing it’s level best to pull up my polytunnel and take it away! My daughter who lives near me has had her lights going on and off so it’s not just up North. And the next one is supposed to be worse!!!! Yikes.
Y'all ready for this? 😎
I am about hour away from London, and now it's really windy. Mother Nature is Angry again.
Buy a wired 'plug in' telephone. Fill the bath. And buy a little gas stove from your local hardware store. Arwen took out our power (inc wireless phone) , All 4G networks went off as did the water (and thus the central heating). For 4 days. It was a novelty for the first 2 days then it was a bloody nightmare. It's sad to say in this day and age but you have to be a bit proactive. Best wishes.
Thanks for the warning signs.
Thanks Aidan 👌
Exciting.
Thanks to whoever did the orange map for Dudley adhering to the North being from York upwards 👍 The north of England is not Manchester, Nottingham or even Birmingham like some people say 🤦🏻‍♂️
Interesting. Funnily enough I live near Dudley in the West Midlands and it`s already blowing half a gale as I write this. Hold on to your hats people....
Speack at weekend on the comments I fancy a rest from comments.
Is there rish of flooding with this system like storm Dennis? Only heard about warnings for wind
Thank you, Aidan. We’re in the SW and have postponed our lunch with a friend on Friday so we don’t have to leave home. We’ve had warnings of power cuts from Thursday which will take longer to repair due to weather conditions outside. SSEN advised blankets, torches, flasks of drinks etc..
Hi on Friday what will the wind be in Portland Dorset DT5 1EY and will the beach road flood again
If you are in Cornwall, Devon, South Wales, expect High winds, high seas, dustbin in Swindon
Well done met office for highlighting the storm area.
13:04 in Glasgow, hardly a breeze, just a wee bit damp.
I'm prepared for those two storms to arrive to the UK this week, thanks for the update Aidan! 🙂👍
Hopefully this will be the last of the storms for this year, the only storms I like are thunderstorms 🌩⚡
Thanks Aidan x
Video length 4:20 🤣🍁 ayyyyy
Thanks for the update 👌
thank you Aidan
I think Dudley and Eunice should have an arranged marriage somewhere near the North pole.  Thanks Aidan.
2nd
