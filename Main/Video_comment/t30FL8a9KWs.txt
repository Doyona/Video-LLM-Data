Is pretty awkward to return to this video and knowing that Square sold the devs that made the games that madeup more than half of this presentation
Fix your fuckingn avengers game
Octopath Traveler 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 please!
Please bring kingdom hearts games to the Nintendo switch as a physical edition. Thank you 🙏🏼
We can ALL kill chaos with the dislike button together!
god the english dubs on these are painful to listen to
I do kinda wish Scott Porter was voicing Peter & Drax was done by Brandon Pail Eels Also might sound kinda ungrateful but that is not Meredith's style of music
Marvel avengers idea vibration suits
im just here to say this.... vagrant story remake?
Sobre o jogo Relic Run vc sabe me falar porque a fase Ruínas do deserto não quer baixar ,mostrar erro mobile
PARASITE EVE RE-RELEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FINAL FANTASY 6 REMAKE!!!!!!!!!!!! STOP WASTING TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you marvel, we don't want to be SE anymore🥱
I keep hoping for a Parasite Eve and Xenogears remaster. I miss them, achingly so.
What's with the downvote!?
With any luck someone in Square Enix will read this and go and have a look at a channel I just came from called 'Osirois Music'. Please please chek it out. God knows why they have so few subscribers. They have some covers of SE/Nobuo music that is either just as good but different or honestly better than the originals in some cases. The writing and composition is stunning, aboslutely stunning.
Foreign terrorist skum company
it's been 3 years and no sign of Just Cause 5 yet :(
Foreign terrorists!!! Remember Ww2 Square? Square Enix donated 250k to the domestic terrorist organization BLM. They are officially enemies of America. Propaganda agenda pushing crt sjw loon skumbags. Dont support any Square Enix game!
Square Enix western games are hot garbage just stick with your roots and focus on japanese titles not this western crap
Hi. Are you guys planning to make a remake of final fantasy xv and final fantasy versus xiii? That game has so much potential don't abandon it please. I just played it in steam and I love it.
Imagine playing a warzone mission with your favorite duo or trio.   Black Widow and Hulk (Beauty and the Beast)   Iron Man, Black Widow & Black Panther (Civil War Team)   Cap & Clint (Civil War Team) I know a lot of the other team mates aren’t out yet but I would still run with what I have.   Thor & Hulk (Ragnarok Team)   Clint & Black Widow (End Game Team)   Cap, Iron Man, & Thor (End Game Team)   Iron Man & Spider Man   I can’t be the only person that sees this logic potential for strike teams. Some times I just want to have a team less then 4 heros.
I'm only here to type CHAOS.
Wow just totally wow new games look awesome and great really epic too yay 🐱
FIX YOUR DAM WEBSITE!!!!!!!! 1997 called and they asked for you to update your website. getting an account set up is the hardest game i EVER PLAYED
We’ll just cause 5 isn’t coming out boys let’s just abandon just cause
I HATE marvel and i love RPG this is the worst showcase square enix ever
Square Enix please get compentent people to start running Final Fantasy Brave Exvius.  Please drop the contract with Gumi as they are neglecting your player base.  Every new character has an issue. EVERY single one released.  Gumi doesnt care and just keeps pushing forward.  Actually look at the bugs list in game.  Please physically look at it.  Less than half have been resolved.
What happened to Square? I used to be so hype for square games. Now…. Not so much. :(
Wish true colors would work on character models everything else looks stunning
Just call it marvel showcase trailer interview and gameplay really
Literally nothing of interest to me. Upsetting
Now eidos makes superhero games sure where is deus ex
Wow very entertaining video 🤗🤗
Square Enix please make a Dragon Quest 9 remake! I want to enjoy that game on my Nintendo Switch as I did many years ago on my Nintendo DS.
Could've brought the FF pixel remaster to Switch, Xbox One and Series X, and the PS4 and PS5.
Please make quality games, not software to fill shitty business decisions.
We Need a Terranigma Remake 😭❤️❤️❤️
Why are they still trying to make their avengers game look good? Nobody believes in that anymore! Accept your mistakes, Square!
Stop f****** pretending that the game is broken fix marvel avengers for fucksake
I wonder how much the "real face" data of the Guardians of the Galaxy actors would have cost.
Remember when you use to make groundbreaking JRPGs? A medley of music, artwork, and creative writing? Octopath Traveler was a runaway success. What seems to be the problem here, Square?
Am I the only one who waited for the Project Oath? I'm wondering about a world of fiction.
I decided to boycott you after you made me buy a ps4 to play FF7 and then made FF7 remake episode 2 a F-ing PS5 Exclusive.   I am sorry but i am not taking another risk for your company. And you made me waste 500 bucks just to F off on us from the platform.  I will never buy a Square game again. The disrespect involved in jebaiting us like that is evil
Holding out hope they will show 16 in a showcase later on this year. Am I that desperate?
Babylon's fall VAs had me confused abit do I take this game seriously, or not? Interesting to see  Sir Knight Garlin's VA  come back for that remake. Otherwise, an okay showcase
i get shivers down my spine every time i hear the final fantasy music. come on wheres the playstation version of ff1-6 remasterd? a final fantasy spin off game do players really want that. i'm a huge ff fan and own almost every ff game and im not sure if i want it. come on you know only ff8 could make a great spin off series. like final fantasy 8 the adventures of seed. game 1 maybe the sorceress returns then lunar crisis and so on. so where is the news of part 2 of the final fantasy 7 remake. a new star ocean would be great. you could also remaster star ocean the second story.
And of course no Tomb Raider update... Lara better get her dual pistols back in the next release, if not we fans will be really pissed off, mark my words.
Keyword: chaos
Where is Super commander?????????
Gamora looks like drug addict
GoTG is too much  for my ears.
After Capcom and Bandai shows up, this presentation from Square Enix turns into decent showcase LOL That summed up how bad E3 this year
I, Garland will knock you all down!
I'm not a fan of He-Man...at all, but the trailer they cut for that new show was much better using the same Bonne Tyler song used here in Guardians.
Thank you for actually having chapters/timestamps
Yay for Matt Mercer! And all Mana games ever.
Parasite Eve Remake? Please?!
So... Final Fantasy I if it had Final Fantasy XV characters?
Ok Square Enix you guys made Marvel Avengers Co-op and Now Guardians of The Galaxy Co-op but when are y'all making a Teen Titans Co-op Game?
I legit need someone to explain to me what will be different about the pixel remaster in comparison to the pc and mobile versions of these games that already exist
Holy crap Square has become pure garbage if they wanna bring something back they should bring back the soul reaver games or port them instead of giving us those shity pixel final fantasy games yea I love final fantasy but im always gonna choose the more detailed versions over 8 bit
Os estáis cargando la empresa….
Babylons Fall Live Service Game. Hype insta kill also looked very bad
Fun fact: Australia is wider than the moon.
square enix is doing amazing rn!
Damn 25 Years of Tomb Raider and no new Chapter. WTF Sqaure Enix WTF
IGN: Too much Chaos 7/10
an excellent MARVEL showcase
I guess you could say this presentation was complete Chaos
This was a shambles...
One of the major failings of the Square Marvel franchise is they failed to use the likeness of the official actors. It's such an obvious requirement they should have included in the project.
I hate you Square Enix.  All of your game are either rehashed trash like FF, or unimaginative garbage like everything else you make.  Just die Square Enix.
Yeah guardians is gonna suck
That classic FF announcement was such a blue balls moment. Going through all 6 of the original pixel art games with buildup just to end it with a bland screen of "steam and mobile". Do a collection on consoles. My lord, so lame
G.O.T.G.👎🤦‍♂️
Yo stranger of paradise looks neat for a PS2 game
This is the worst Square Enix lineup in decades…
John 3:16-18  Jesus loves you  Jesus is coming back very soon to judge this world and set up his kingdom that will reign forever and ever. Hell is real,hell wasn't made for humans but for fallen angels but if you reject Jesus and his sacrifice you will end up in hell. Whoever you worship on earth is who you will worship in the afterlife. Repent before it is too late. Please i plead with you for the sake of GoD
Why do Drax, Peter, and Rocket all have the same voice actor not trying to do different voices? Also, why do I HAVE to play as Quill? Surely being at least able to switch who you control would be better like Dragon Age?
This felt like a huge flop, just like outriders :(, I hope that they seriously step up in 2022.
Too bad there's no mention of any Dragon Quest games.
C H A O S
wheres final fantasy 16?
Overall dislike sadly, I am only interested in Babylon's fall
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17-For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23-For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
This was BAD SE. No one cares about most of this. You haven't had any updates on your 2 most anticipated games. Don't bother with a presentation ever again unless you have something to share about FF16 or the next FF7R game. Those are your anchor pieces and everything else is filler to those when doing a presentation. Without them don't bother with a presentation. It would have been better to do nothing and skip E3 altogether.  Sorry Guardians will sell poorly. Its generic looking gameplay, and only good reviews from streaming channels can save it. Good luck...Stop with the Avengers game. It bombed because it lacked the X-Men. Which is exactly why Ultimate Alliance 3 succeeded. X-Men were present and by far outclassed the Avengers. X-Men is the only thing that will save The Avengers. Your fans want FF1-6 on CONSOLE. Switch would be great....
That "Chaos" game looks like it came straight out of PS3 with Unreal 3 lol. Good lord chaos, what are these graphics?!
Guardians of the Galaxy NEEDS a Super awesome Mixtape Vol. 3!!!
18:38 Huge missed opportunity to bring them to console.
Some Soul Calibur vibes in that Final Fantasy with polo shirt...
FF7R Part 2 was the one thing from Square Enix that I cared about...
That end music
Stranger of Paradise looks like devil may cry meets final fantasy. Also why no update on FFXVI
This was pure chaos
I want Life Is Strange and I'm sad we didn't have any news on Tomb Raider saga 😭
Only marvel BORING we want see kingdom hearts 4
No kingdom hearts 💔
Wtf were you thinking square?
Can you work on that?  "Exploring the body's Sexually needs"  Can do? Video Games help us with sex life needs with same sex needs or and different sex needs. Why this health? For Men, Women, and other genders.  Why do Video Games do for Health with sexual needs for all sexual orientation?  Can you help use feel better sexual needs as human with in Video Game World, Today?  34 minutes talks  Can have gust from Video Game like Nintendo, Sony, & Microsoft?   (MandM) Sex with Men as an Man  (WandW) Sex with Women as an Woman
How many times can you say the word "chaos" in 2:30 minutes? Square Enix: YES!
You should fire the marketers that are so embarrassed of your Japanese games that they won't spend more than 3 seconds on each despite this being a great opportunity for free promotion. Braindead and pathetic. Capcom grew out of this need to westernize to great success, why can't you? Neo Twewy comes out in a month and a half, and if someone blinked, they would have missed it. But we got over 20 minutes of Marvel. Idiotic
Stranger of paradise looks like a hardcore final fantasy..
A whole better than Gearbox!
Square has so many games in development. They're hitting a good stride..
What a lame presentation.
FINALLY FINAL FANTASY 1 THRU 6 ON PC LETS GOOOOO
Such a disappoiting mess...  Squaresoft's gloden era seems so far away. Instead of these live service crappy games, you need to give us a proper Vagrant Story Remake in Dark Souls Style. Come on, bring back Leamundis guys!
Why do all black characters have a rap/hip-hop song for their theme?
The worst Square Enix's presentation.
Guardians of the Galaxy: I’ll never buy it but I have to admit the trailer was pretty good.
FF 1-6 on steam and Mobile meh
Man, this gave me really Konami when they stopped caring vibes.  Just sad
_Square Enix_ just take -Babylon's Fail- behind the shed & give it the old yeller treatment already!
Welp, nothing to see here. Marvel diarrhea, remakes, and live service game...
Y'all are so out of touch!!  FF 1-6 NOT on Nintendo Switch.... A traditional gaming platform of gamers that would probably pay 60.00 for the whole collection.  No Dragon Quest promoting at all during the show..... Your so bad with DQ that the Dragon Quest official channel was buried in all sorts of different party influencer content.   This lack of knowing how to reading the room and your trying to slowly assimilate Final Fantasy console gamers into mobile gamers which is dumb in itself  Somehow Life is Stooge gets more priority over a legacy franchise like Dragon Quest on a wider appeal world stage...  FF1 Strangers is a freaking meme because y'all scripted that trailer....  Y'ALL NEED TO READ THE ROOM AND DO BETTER!!! ..
Still no Thief :(
The final fantasy pixel remaster HAS to come to console for it to do well I know there is a market on phones but not nearly as large as a single console and the pc playing these classics just don’t hit the same that it would on a console
how sad not a single dragon quest entry today i was really looking forward to it hopefully happening
konami 2010 part 2
I don’t really see the point of the Life is Strange remaster
does anyone know if legend of mana would have a physical copy along with the plushies in the Philippines?
Ehm...sooo 1-6 is being put out on steam/mobile but not consoles? Okay then.
This was the most cancerous E3 showing Square Enix has ever done, just nonstop combo of game industry cancer after cancer after cancer all stacked up in a row. If the only thing you've got to announce is 3 new things and destroy all reason to look forward to Babylon's Fall, just don't even do a show, Square. If next year is gonna be like this, you do not warrant your own show, just walk away and save your dignity. Every company thinks they're big enough to justify their whole own show, and they just don't, it's a waste of time and you bum out all your fans and non-fans alike.
TOO MANY MOBILE GAMES! 😡
this was just awful
These video game conferences are 🦗
worst SE E3 of all time
Surely the worst conference of all
Good to see the LiS remaster. Love that series.
It’s kinda sad that a licensed marvel game was the high point of this conference.
This was absolutely pathetic.
I never asked for this, give me DEUS EX!!!
Final Fantasy game is known for it's beautiful looking character with over the top hairstyle. Here a rugged looking guy with generic hairstyle 001 Also: CHAOS!!
I was a little let down with the weird ffxv party they put into origin. I was hoping for some ff1 style character building and job/class selection. 😓  We'll see where this goes. Because personally, i could see your main guy jack turning into chaos with how much he needs to "kill chaos"  OG dialogue would be like "destroy" or "rid the world of your chaos/darkness"   I dunno, seems a bit over the top to spew the word so much. And then the VOs seemed almost like the same guy doing Garland and Jack. 🤷‍♂️
Marvel/Disney will ruin everything...
Pire conf de cet E3.  Vous vous êtes surpassé pour nous offrir de la merde en boîte, un gros GG à vous car se louper à ce point ça tient du génie. :-(
That was kinda embarrassing Square Enix.
Mama… This Is Garbage 🗑!!
Congratulations Square Enix, E3 isn't even over yet and you have secured yourself a firm spot in last place. I give your presentation this year a F*CK YOU/10.
No ff16!
IS all of the games in pre-alpha stage ?  Animation look clunk as f
Can you say "Epic Fail"?
Too much focus on mobile
Guardians looks nuts and hilarious I can’t wait to play it!   Only downfall is the character designs, I wish they looked more closely to the MCU actors, but even still, the voice actors do sound like they’re doing a good job to represent the characters.
Why would they not give the classic FFs the Octopath treatment they've already announced for Dragon Quest 😞 Instead we get more mobile ports that, by their hesitation of actually showing anything about them, will look just as hideous as their previous efforts on that front ☹
Babylons Fall English voice over is just terrible, so amateur. Please redo this!
i’m not surprised.  fans should learn the distinction when the preparations were made in the west vs made in Japan.  the announcement poster for E3 is similar to the other underwhelming showcase involving Balan Wonderworld and LiS: True Colors prior to E3.
utter dogshit. why did you spend over half the presentation on another mediocre marvel game?
I have to ask since it wasn't answered in the trailer - does GotG have a great soundtrack?
So much try hard and cringe! What happened to the Square I used to know?
Garbarzio. Italian for 🗑
The guardians of the galaxy game looks so underwhelming…
So no FF16?
seeing Square Enix trying to salvage the Avangers game is very funny to me! that game is D.E.A.D
Whoever thought that bringing 20 minutes of a Guardian of the Galaxy game to an audience full of RPG gamers need to be fired 😂
I wonder if that guy wants to kill chaos.
Life is strange games are pretty good.
Why do stranger of paradise graphics look like ps3
lost me at live service
Bring Final Fantasy 1-6 to Consoles or NO BUY!!!
I am Chaos
I'm keeping my eye on Guardians of the Galaxy, it's Eidos Montreal and i love both Deus Ex games from them. But i hope they can smooth out Star Lord in-between animations, looks so janky here. So disappointed to hear Platinum Games working on a live service game but let's see.   Btw, CHAOS!!!
Dont ever come back with that BS again
You know you're E3 was trash right?
Me: "Can't be worst than 2018 Square Enix Showcase" Square Enix: "Hold my Chaos"
Ok now bring all the games together and give us a endgame video game where they all die :D
3/10. Too much Chaos. -IGN, probably
26:44  Friendly reminder that the chat ( at least in some of them) Unanimously decided to spam Sus and amongus
The guardians presentation is too long but looks fun
Wow, I didn’t think it could be worse than Ubisoft’s show. This was truly awful.
guardians of the galaxy is what the avengers should have been. They have decades of lore they could have went with instead of that live service failure.
Why does Square Enix always have the worst E3 conference?
I just felt disappointed. All these games look trash.
Only life is strange for me. Possibly guardians of the galaxy. Too bad the final fantasy remasters isn’t coming to console. I am not a mobile gamer and I don’t use a PC for gaming.
One of the worst showcases I've seen in quite some time.
Wait what was that Stranger of Paradise guy here to do again?
Babylon's Fall is a live service game and there's no mention of Tomb Raider anything even though it is its 25th anniversary? Whack presentation Square.
All the remasters but,  WHERE THE *&%$ IS MY FINAL FANTASY XIII -SERIES- REMATER?!?!
Gaurdians of the Galaxy really lookin like FFXV bro
Did anybody tell SE their graphics come from Persona 5.
they say "chaos" every five seconds like they're trying to remake Sonic Adventure
Is there going to be another one? I was so excited for this, but beside waiting to import a physical Legend of Mana  Remaster (for some reason Square Enix doesn't think we deserve physical remasters in North America, as if we don't also love their games)  I literally couldn't be less excited for this lineup. Oh yeah, I also can't play Final Fantasy 7 Intergrade because I don't have a PS5 even though I bought the deluxe edition. 🤬
Steam and mobile for Final Fantasy Remaster?  Damn, square. You really gotta have quite the talent to generate hype and then kill it by the end of the same announcement. Physical on switch, then you get my money.
Marvel trying to wreck eidos’s rep with these games.
If I don't see a final fantasy 1-4 release on the switch I'm throwing away my switch!
Mir kommen manche Stimmen aus den anderen Teilen von LIS bekannt vor
Where is FF16???????????
trash
I prefer the more cynical drax.
I had to check 5 times to make sure this was released in E3 2021
This conference was meh to say the least!  Now I have to kill Chaos!  But his power lever is OVER 9,000!!
I love how in the chat someone keeps saying  PS5 🤮🤮🤮
This was awful.
Me: Gee, one of these days I should play those Final Fantasy games... Square Enix: *6 more titles dropped in this video alone, in addition to the dozens of games already released* Me: Nope...
Endless microtransaction excuses, porting the snes FF games for the 20th time, another marvel game that looks nothing like the movies, and another devil may cry ripoff. Ever get the feeling Squenix is losing alot of money?
Final fantasy: other m
So no final fantasy 16 announcement or any good actual good games coming from square enix got it
Nobody's gonna talk about 26:44, huh
Wow! That was awesome! Can't wait to play Guardians Of The Galaxy.  By the way, thanks for Russian Subs. Love you!
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Because ruining Marvel's Avengers simply wasn't bad enough, now Square Enix is gonna  desecrate another amazing franchise
This was TRASH
Babylon's Fall looks more FF than Chaos.
3:11 why is he in a leather suit? Does he think he a video game character ?
ff1-6 on emu?
Square enix is gonna crush it this year
sucks.
HEY ORIGINS!!! The early 2000s called they want their edge back....
Stranger of paradise:1 "what you want to eat"  2" anything but CHAOS" 1"How was work?" 2"It was CHAOS" LOL can go all day with this but I'll wait for the game i really hope every third word isn't CHAOS. 😆
Babylon’s Fall... that was placeholder VO, right? That isn’t the VO work in the actual game is it?
Who wants all these games on just mobile. I want them on consoles
You spend a third of your presentation showcasing a Guardians of the Galaxy game that looks like it may be pretty good. Then you followed it up by reminding everyone of your Avengers failure. Fire whomever made that decision.
This is the worst square enix presents, where is final fantasy XVI  I really hope Nintendo saves e3 in Tuesday
I consider myself a Square Enix fan, but if this is the best you can put forward I'm really concerned for the future of this company.
None of this was good.
i did just buy a new phone so some phone games are nice
legend of mana is gonna be an awesome switch game.
The Stranger of paradise trailer is like being in a bad larping group, forgetting your costume, only bringing your sword, and you haven't beaten skylanders yet.
james run and gunn lol
Square had way more the Ubisoft the pixel remasters of those six classic Final Fantasy games are going to be so good for my Final Fantasy collection. even though there was no Legacy of Kain remasters or sixth title in that series but I bet Guardians of the Galaxy will be just as good Suzan and her robots will be watching for copyrights on that game. the I shall ride with the pink haired lad then destroy CHOAS then beat up Garlic Jr. Hype more real here the Ubisoft;)
I can't believe they bought likes to pivot the ratio
Could have just skip e3.2021
Hey chrono trigger remake 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Minus for no FF 1-6 on PS4!!!
what the hell
What's the song at the end?
Why doesn't SE just sell it's self to Sony already lol all their games are only PlayStation
and here i was hoping for a dragon quest 9 remake sadge :(
only significant news is the final fantasy 1-6 pixel remake. RIP
You're telling me that remakes of NES and SNES games aren't coming to the Switch, a Nintendo console?
Mavel games sucks they are trash squareenix why
They keep pushing life services  like is something  we want
Square why
I feel like remasters of the original six Final Fantasies barely getting a footnote in a Square Enix presentation is rather concerning.
Stream starts at 41:16 Your welcome
What did they hire the big green dub sheesh.... I know shadow was triggered. "JUST FINISH IT, CHAOOOOS CONTROL!"
Look great the DevilFinalMayFantasyCry5. And I cannot wai for FinalFreeFantasyFire XD is sarcams. SquareEnix as joke
oh boy another phone game -_-
I sure hope those pixel remasters release on Switch and PlayStation too. I’ve been playing those stories on my mobile for years, and I don’t game on a PC. I’d love to play the classics on a TV again via a console.
final fantasy on mobile and steam only.  that sucks.  this whole presentation sucked.  square enix sucks.  trying to say suck has many times as chaos. I don't think I have enough room.
ここに来て　主題歌【ヒーロー！】
Square Enix showcase in a nutshell: 39:06
Anyone know what song plays at 6:59? And what song Quill is listening to on his Walkman in the start screen at 7:14?
Guardians of the Galaxy seems like what we were hoping for the next Mass Effect game
I bet the reason for guardians of galaxy looking unpolished because in the middle of development they change their focus and made it into single-player after disastrous launch of avenger. Looks like sqaure didn't gave them a new budget and they had to work with what they had after changing direction.
Yet no spider man show case for marvel avengers. The only reason i came to watch this was to see if there an update on that!
Soooo .... whut happened to ff XVI ? axed already ? or is it to become FF XIX ? are you very sure it's a good idea to go all over the place with your FF again ? cause you know didn't work so good for XIII and vs XIII / XV ...
No Deus Ex news, incredible
Wow those 3 avengers fans must be excited for more terrible content lol dead game
Guardians of the galaxy - Meh final fantasy pixel remaster - Cautious optimism Marvel's avengers - why tho? Hitman - idk, not a fan Nier Reincarnation - I was excited, then they went "it's for mobile", now i'm back to "Meh" Final Fantasy VII: the first soldier - looked really cool, then it went "it's for mobile". i fear it won't last and someone who makes decisions for which projects are made will go "LOOK! this FF7 game didn't do well, clearly the fanbase HATES FF7 stuff!!!" (you know for a fact some dipshit in a suit will say it at some point) Babylon's fall - looks interesting! will stay tuned for more Life is strange - Meh Stranger of Paradise - This one's the money shot in my book, this one got me hyped.
If the FF 1-6 collection versions aren’t at least better than the GBA ports, there’s no reason to not just pirate those ports.
Pretty lack luster year for square Enix if I'm being honest.
I guess that Avengers’ game did well enough to justify a Guardians game, despite all the negative press.
Final Fantasy Origin was such a letdown. It would've been so much more interesting if they at least had similar clothes to FF1 characters. The main three look ridiculous and totally out of place next to each other. Its like they were all made with different artstyles in mind, but no one wanted to bother redesigning them. Especially the, who I assume is, the main character, the dude who has no armor at all and looks like he's wearing just a regular shirt and pants. I don't mind "CHAOS" bit since its supposed to be FF1 type of thing, but man does the game look bland.
they can't hype up FF XVI when it's not coming out soon, so let them stay quiet about it and keep working on it for now.
this was embarassingly bad.
No DQX release to NA? ;/  No FFVII RE to PC? ;/
I was kinda hoping for a Final Fantasy 13 remaster, And maybe on switch too?
stop making me listen to a bunch of nobodys talking about how great the game is but actually just reminding me these are soulless corporate products
you thought youre getting ff16 and 7 part 2 news? think mark think!
Trash.
How the eff is there still not a FFXIII collection on PS4/PS5?
Wow Square Enix had better presentation then XBox with Guardians of the Galaxy alone🤦🏽‍♂️👏🏽👏🏽
A see a lot of unhappy people here, but despite that, I found this to be the best presentation of the day.
Well next time maybe wait another year before showing stuff...this one was just a let down.  Locking down the Twitter SquareEnixUSA wont save you from bad press, it will only make it worse.
...not to mention that "CHAOS" is probably one of the most blandest names you can have for a villain.
Huh, I must've clicked the wrong video. I was looking for the Square Enix presentation, not Marvel.
Looool @ the Stranger in Paradise protag.  - Vanilla face - Polo shirt - Ultra bland kill quotes on repeat every five seconds  *_"die!" "take this!" "you're finished!"_*
Cashing off loyal fans of your dying franchises by making mobile games is straight-up dogshit, I guess you guys stopped caring.  P.s the best thing you did today was to make Ubisoft's presentation seem like a Rocketship launch.
Guardians of Galaxy not on PC? Sad
Final Fantasy gets no screenshots but Marvel gets so much time? >.<
38:23🥶
wow 💀
Disappointed that the final fantasy pixel remaster is coming to Mobile. Such a waste. Oh well, moving on.  I didn't even have high expectations for this and still feel letdown. Hahaha
and ... TOMB RAIDER ?? IT'S ON ITS 25TH ANNIVERSARY AND THEY DIDN'T ANNOUNCE ANYTHING ... I HATE YOU🙄🙄
OK YOU ARE SHOWING OFF FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE BUT I DON'T HAVE A PS5 I WANT A PS5
final fantasy origin wow not bad
Now *this* is a presentation!! I freaking *LOVED IT!!*  Looking forward to more Marvel games and the Final Fantasy Origins game for the Xbox Series X (not to mention Final Fantasy XVI once that time limit expires).  And looking forward to the rest that's just for the PS5!  Looks like I will be using both Sony and Microsoft machines a bit more evenly this generation. Last generation was so lopsided for me. Looks like Sony is turning that around this generation.  Bet!
Smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
bro they could atleast have a warrior of light reference in the garland/chaos game omg
life and strange the first one is a masterpiece
That Strangers game is gonna cause so much damage to the franchise, FFXVI is gonna suffer because of it
My god. You had 2 years for you to get prepared for this. Why does it seem that you literally put this presentation together this morning? Shame
Garbage game show, not even surprise at this point.
Wow, you really showed life is tumblr instead of Ff16 🤡
Guardians 👌👌
I like dark theme, but ff origin is too far from the original...at least make a party of 4. And The Warrior of light is not pretty at all, he is supposed to be a knight, not a cowboy with a melee weapon.
Bring the Final Fantasy games to console!
FF1 to FF6 on mobil, well that is disapointing.
Marvel Studios!!!! Errrr waaaait a second 🤔
So it's mostly just mobile games and crappy live services that no one likes?   All you guys had to do was announce a new Kingdom Hearts game for consoles, it shouldn't have been that difficult.
I am disappointed they did not use the voice actors/likenesses of the Guardians movies, with an all new story/adventure
I just want Xenogears
Wtf was this trash...
That's a whole lot of trash, SquareEnix.
Absolute trash. Take 2-3-4 years of if you dont have anything to show. Dont hype up E3 and then drop this embarrassment on us. Worst show of e3 yet.
Oh no. Babylon’s Fall is a live service. All these years i've been waiting to be so disappointed. My disappointment is immeasurable
If I had a nickel for every time the hot anime man said chaos
Ffs where is tomb raider 4
good that i didnt watch it. No Tomb Raider, no intrest. Next
Thank you, Matt Mercer! :D
It would've been great if these were put on Switch... 19:06
There is no way a conference in years can be worse than this one.
So 40 minutes of Marvel stuff - as someone who just has never liked Super Heroes or been into Comics in any meaningful way I'm just sick to death of it penetrating every aspect of entertainment. Surely even the fans must be exhausted at this point?  It's not a good sign IMO when the most interesting thing shown was 10 seconds of a Nier spin-off phone game.
Why Japanese games introduced here look like a Chinese mobile game ?
Hey , just wondering is that an out of season April fools joke ?
So glad that Cor from FFXV bleached his hair so he could fight evil All-Might from the first game who fused with Caius from FF XIII-2
That was awesome.  Thank you Square for the presentation
Honestly can't believe how atrocious this show was
Wooohooo a super hero game
Chaos. Chaos, chaos, darkness, chaos. Final Fantasy.... *sigh*
22:32 - Ganondorf.
Idk why everyone hated this, the Guardians game looked amazing (and Idgaf about Marvel stuff) and the new Life is Strange sounds awesome
Music at 16:56 anyone? So good!
Release Nier Reincarnation on consoles please
I don't want to be Star-Lord ! I hoped to be Cloud again or Squall or freaking Zidane !!!!!
This Square Enix Presents made me an alcoholic
Wait it's pronounced square ehnix
It‘s sad, that Peter Quill in this game doesn‘t look like in the movie. :(  Pls let the FFVII First Soldier game for mobile be playable via Controller on iPhone/iPad!
When spiderman in avengers game?
😆
WTF?!
Only 2 seconds of Endwalker, lol...
Curious if the Life is strange remaster includes a better story
So bad 😭
Stop with marvel. Square enix real fans don't care about marvel. Do real final fantasy
One day they will open their showcase with the chrono trigger clock....one day...
I was expecting "FF1 action rpg"  what I got was "FF15 but dark souls tho"
This Square Enix Presents was CHAOSSSS 🤦
Like how much of a pixel remaster?
The battle of the century:  Dhar Mann's "You see.." vs Stranger of Paradise's "Chaos"
Well avengers game is trash. Well the guardians of the Galaxy looks good and single player but avengers so going to give that a miss for at least a year. Nothing special
*C H A O S*
Babylonia fall is German high medieval fantasy ARPG based in Iraq... Looks like st George (who's Syrian) is featured on murals. Seems like a missed opportunity.
So... Tomb Raider is celebrating 25 years and we dont even get a freaking next gen update for the trilogy collection? Nothing? Oh and dont let me strat on Deus Ex .... smh

Remember when Square Enix made the best jrpg's..... yeah, those were the good old days
As usual, it sucked
Read your audience and GTFO
I miss the good ol days when they'd make us wait 6 years for a new Final Fantasy or Kingdom Hearts, but they were always FINISHED and a masterpiece tbh
No PC release for FF7R is legitimately one of the most disappointing things in gaming all year
Vayanse alv
Square Enix has no games this year except for marvel apparently
Well this was dissapointing. Half of it was a drawn out guardians feature and their big titles were relegated to 10 second clips of stuff we've already seen. A shame.
"I'm here to kill Chaos." Me: Why do I hear boss music?
6:54 “They delivered everything you would want in a Guardians game” ...except being able to play as the Guardians, lol
Okay now where legacy of kain and the 2nd half of mankind divided ?
thanks for kill babylon's fall
wow.. I think this was the most disappointing showcase I've ever seen. Not only did the developers of one of my favorit franchises (Nioh) come up with this Final Fantasy chaos bs. No! Platinum games (the freaking Nier Automata developers!) also had to destroy Babylon's Fall, a game I was pretty hyped about. HOW can they show this after Nier Automata!? They also must have seen how terrible Babylon's Fall looks compared to their previous titles. Also let's not forget the 2 words that so far brought any game down to it's knees: LiFe SeRvIcE!! And for the final nail in the coffin, they didn't give any new information for the upcoming Final Fantasy game.  PS: The voice actor must have felt like the biggest idiot on the planet recording the trailer for Stranger of Paradise.
Wow!!!!! That Final Fantasy 16 trailer was ……… oh that’s right. There wasn’t one. But hooray. A Guardians of the Galaxy game, that no one asked for. Man. E3 sucks this year!
Would have liked to see more for TWEWY and Forspoken. Instead of 20 minutes of Marvel. And no FF7R2 updates? Or FF16? C'mooon.
Why is every trailer of the last 3 years using "I Need A Hero"?
So I logged in to a stream of bashing against Square Enix and now I caught & I get it what is all about. Guardians of the Galaxy is looking GREAT, but unexpected. It's as if NetherRealm Studios announced My Little Pony game for 35' and left last 5 min of the video for a slightly disappointing Mortal Kombat. It is good just not... what their regular audience were expecting.
no deus ex?
Strangers of Paradise has me very worried. The initial writing, animation, and gameplay seems very reminiscent of Japanese games trying too hard to cater to Western tastes (or rather stereotypes) in gaming that happened a lot during the 360/PS3 days. It's especially disappointing since I'm a big Team Ninja fan. Characters designs are all over the place, dialog is hammy, weapons too bulky. Here's to hoping it gets a facelift.  I'm also hoping we see more about what these FF Remasters are going to be like. Hopefully they're not straight ports.
When you keep telling everyone that all new games are crap....you can't go wrong
"Wow, Noctis is so edgy" Stranger of Paradise is shown "perhaps I judged you too harshly"
WTF no kingdom hearts?!?!
Guardians of the Galaxy 19 mins wow
I could hear thousands cringe in unison every time Anime Duke Nukem said "Chaos!!!".
Once again a major let down anybody just watching dont bother mostly marvel avengers and mobile game lame Af square enix
More than half of the presentation was just Marvel and Life is Strange.  Why are you like this, Square?
These all look wack
…Wow…
after skimming thru this i'm glad i didn't watch this live
Did they only have one voice actor for the guardians of the galaxy game
Please, next year, don't.
The music choice for Babylon’s Fall was really whack.
Y’all really had 2 years and came up with this?
That classic FF announcement was such a blue balls moment. Going through all 6 of the original pixel art games with buildup just to end it with a bland screen of "steam and mobile". Do a collection on consoles. My lord, so lame
I believe Square Enix was purposely trying to destroy people’s YouTube and twitch channels with all of that copyright music in the first half of the show
All I really want right now is a FFXIII / FFXIII remaster ... 😭
The Tomb Raider franchise is being neglected
I want more Balan
Bro, I literally just wanted a release date for the Nier mobile game. Damn, also marvel took up like 40 minutes of this.
Nobody asked for GOG from you Square. Or Avengers for that matter. When will you learn?
CHAOS.
I had some small hope there would be some deus ex news
Oof, big oof...Not to mention 20 minutes of none stop talking from the Guardians. Seriously how much of the budget went on voice acting, they never shut up, instant turn off for that one. Avengers DLC, oww you mean the game everyone hates? No Kingdom Hearts, No FF16 and 2 minutes of a middle age homeless man raging about chaos. WTF was this Square, were you drunk?
Since when did square enix abandon final fantasies and turn into the marvel studio?
FF16 = the only reason I wasted my time here also hoping for a FF5 true remake someday in near future not another remaster with two more pixels or mobile game
SE, get your sh*t together. Like seriously. Where are the games everyone wants and are just delivering westcrap which no one asked for. No FF16?! NO DQ?! Nothing about the other Projects?! What the heck is wrong with you.
wosrt Showcase
So dumb to not release I-VI on Switch, best place for these games
Final fantasy 1-6 needs a switch port
Song name from 7:30?
This was crap. IOS games and marvel trash.
What? No Quiet Man 2?
Boo mobile games
That was so disappointing.
and the new stuff of square enix is a totaly trush.they dont make the love of making a masterpiece jrpg
Square Enix having an identity crisis... of "chaos chaos chaos." JRPGs and the obscure platformer is your bread and butter. Marvel ended with ENDGAME. This ain't it chief. The character design and voice acting division needs help. Flagship series FF1-6 on mobile and steam AGAIN? Why even bother if your just gonna sprinkle it like feeding fish and walking away. PS5, Switch & XBOX are always sold out. What are we doing here? Saving me money I guess...
This company disappoints me in more ways than I can explain
what happend to square enix the more they make a game the more they worse. and what about the classic ff 1 to 6. really its only on steam and android. what is really going on square u make me disapointed.😖
Gameplay Preview > Prerendered Trailers
The stream was so bad it made my internet go out 😂
Buuuu
They need to announce final fantasy 7 part 2 already. Shouldn’t have wait 2 plus years for the next chapter
Where is Nier gestalt?
What an absolute disaster of E3 presentation just wow
Of course, the Final Fantasy I - VI remake collection gets 20 seconds of footage with no gameplay, while the Life is Strange remaster pack gets 3 minutes. If that doesn't show how messed up SE is as a company these days, I don't know what does.
Garbage
If that Stranger of Paradise game is supposed to be a remake of FFI (Since it's called "Final Fantasy Origin" and Garland/the Chaos Shrine are in it), then I'm going to be pissed
Great show, really looking forward to that Kill Chaos game coming out on the 360.
Great show!
When I heard that Babylon’s Fall would be a live service game, I knew this wouldn’t end well.
is that JoJo
Wish i could down vote this garbage twice. Those mobile ads are garbage, e3 is garbage. The video game industry sucks now.
Best thing about this presentation was Matt Mercer
there's some Squarenix in this Marvel presentation

AW...no Balan Wonderworld  DLC/Sequel...nothing but sucky games from here on out...
Good job, Square. The haters have a PHD. Pro Haters Degree.
worst e3 showcase ever
Thank for the middle finger to the fans, not sure why you would want to  piss us of like that.
First I need a Hero, and now Bad Reputation? We gonna add more from the Shrek films? lol
Wasn't it a Marvel's showcase?
Wow another shitty E3 just like yesterday, nothing good.
2:34
Extremely disappointing
So disappointing. I'm still excited for 16, somehow, but what a terrible showing for FF in general.

I'll give it 11 minutes before Square Enix does damage control on this E3 presentation.
Aside the guardian of the galaxy and final fantasy origin, this was awful.  Do better square enix
well thats 45 minutes I won't ever get back thanks for wasting my time, love FF games but fed up with all the remake/remaster/ports of them its time you did tomb raiders from ps1 next event I will dodge as this wasn't worth watching.
Who is liking this?
I really hope they saved something for a potential Sony State of Play. Otherwise, this was utterly weak, sorry. Guardians and Life is Strange look good, but the rest? Need a better look at FF Origins, but the trailer was weak and bad looking.
COMPLETE TRASH!
u used me...for LAND DEVELOPMENT...that wasn’t nice
....that was an absolutely SHITTY presentation.  2/10 at best
I think Platinum games tried a little too hard in making Babylon look unique, and forgot about making it actually look good.        It kinda looks like it was made in Dreams
Waiting for Forspoken game. It looks amazing.
what an excellent MARVEL showcase
Lmao anyone else saw all the "❌🏳️‍🌈❌🏳️‍🌈❌🏳️‍🌈❌" homophobic comments when Life is Strange started playing ? Crazy how many gamers are little incels who instantly hates when their protagonist isn't straight, white, and male/female  Like bro grow up, it's the 21st century, people are gay, trans, bi, pan, you name it. F'ing idiots.
Fans : *want some news about FFXVI, FFVIIR-2 and eventually Kingdom Hearts*  Square Enix : Oh so this what y'all are asking since then ? Well, take these Marvel games trailers instead, oh and here a little bit of FF Origin. You won't say we didn't present any FF !
So the FF1-6 collection is Steam/Mobile only despite most gamers hating that kind of crap, Origins looks like a generic half assed Devil May Cry with the demo being PS5 only because up yours to the legions of people still stuck on PS4, a few remasters and endless Marvel shilling. You're embarrassing yourselves, Square Enix. Go give the FF14 team a big fat pay rise because they are carrying you HARD these days. You used to set trends, release legendary titles, made our childhoods worth a damn. Now look at you. A shadow of your former selves selling Live Service toss and very little we actually want. Go to your room and you think about what you did. Bad Square Enix. Bad. *Bops on nose with rolled up newspaper*
Should have made the Gotg stuff shorter went on for far too long.
well very dispointed..... I was so exited to watch some dragon quest and FF news but all I got it's a Avenger game DLC and gardian of galaxy game but nobody care about those game trash game. Where's 35 anniversary dragon quest ????
That was it ???????  WTF ?????
Well, at least the V/O artist pronounced "Mana" correctly. First time in a while.
was hoping for tomb raiders to be remastered but there was nothing about tomb raider at all yet it's advertised that's all we need they could have finished telltales gotg this wasn't worth it ff remake ff remasters and another ff game too may too fast just watered down trash as of late. I really was hoping for something better
This was amazing! They managed to have the worst presentation so far!
When you need to kill Chaos, but you only have a polo shirt.
final fantasy origins designs are very bad
Stranger of Paradise writers: "Don't you think it sounds weird having him say CHAOS every 5 seconds?" "Nah, it's good"
BORING!!!!!  You barely had anything original! 70% of it was licensed games. And what original stuff you did have was lackluster. I didn't even have any expectations and I was still disappointed.
Chaos/10
Finally Steam gets the first three FF games! I just hope these games have the new, good translation. And have cool options for, like, original visuals and music and stuff. I want this to be as good as fans would mod it, but without having to rely on fans to finish /fix the games for SE.
I came in hopes  of Kingdom Hearts. left the presentation  with CHAOS
Although Final Fantasy origins seemed interesting, repeating “Chaos” every two minutes gave me cringe, I don’t wanna play the game and hear “chaos” every time they open their mouth and the gameplay looked outdated. Lmao
just disappointing.
Literally who asked for Guardians of the Galaxy?
did they rly just show 25 minutes of MARVEL at the BEGINNING of the stream, but since the stream went 44 minutes with the [square enix presents]sign stretching it. A HALF OF THEIR STREAM with it?! who made this stream? this is a devastating dissatisfaction.  litterally a waste of time SE. im sry. where are YOUR GAMES? you only showed mobile and a PS5 title. [chaos] where is Kingdom hearts? Where is final fantasy 16 ?! Where is the world ends with you??? you wasted 2 minutes for those bunched together. BUT SHOW MARVEL FOR MORE THAN HALF THE STREAM? This stream. ABSOLUTE. FAILURE.
Square is a joke
wow square enix ... they did not even try. looking at how the NA games were diverse and interesting I don't see why the Japanese ones were EXTREMELY lacking and focused solely on "remastering" .... Disappointed is a huge understatement ..
no switch port for final fantasy 1-6 I'm upset
WORST E3 GAMING SHOWCASE GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL
I love Square Enix but that presentation was WEAK.
Guardians are awesomeeeee
Why is this age restricted for me when I have age restrictions off?
Um...Wow square enix. Not even gonna show FFXVI yet? lmfao. Instead waste our time on some shitty marvel games and life is strange? *smh*. yeah, that conference was just outright garbage.  And no, asking them to show off FFXVI, which is probably what the majority of people care about, is not too much to ask.
This was so trash 🤣🤣🤣💀🗑
Legacy of Kain community on life support
What a bullshit. 20 min of stupid GOG and avengers. Just trash! I’m very angry about that.
When I saw the Final Fantasy 1-6 remastered collection I lost my mind, and then it said steam and mobile and I died inside
This is disappointing… 1/10.
I miss Parasite Eve
half of this was marvel games.
I'm hoping guardians of the galaxy isn't a avengers reskin
That was bad! No FF16, no FF7R, no KH...
What a waste of time we wanted to see a Tomb Raider. I'm going to pretend this never existed.
46 min of pure cringe content.
Replacing blood with crystals is aesthetically pleasing...
You see your not dealing with the average disappointment
This was just a BIG WASTE OF TIME!!! NOT EVEN A NEW TOMB RAIDER GAME! VERY DISSAPOINTED!!!
this was trash
That was very low
TOKYO RPG FACTORY😟😭
Only good things in this were Guardians of the Galaxy which looked decent, and Life is Strange True Colors
Wow that was... dissapointing. Guardians is only okay, Origins is okay, and Babylon's Fall looks downgraded. And no XVI or new game.
WHERE TF IS SOUL REAVER GODDAMMIT
CHAOS
To me LiS games didnt age at all and they still look perfectly fine, difference between original and remastered is barely visible imo. Its good they made it but twas 100% Unnecessary
Nintendo will bring us order
absolute trash
Nice E3 2018 Event
feels bad whn so far ubisoft's presentation was the one that impressed the most. cant believe im sayin this but im gonna have to rely on dumbass nintendo to save e3 now
That was horrible wow
NO DRAGON QUEST 12 OR 3 OR 10 RIP
Downgrade zzzzzzzz 🤢🤢🤢🤮🤢🤮🤮
the GOTG writer, has a star wars poster for the camera... very enthusiastic
That was a let down overall
Final Fantasy Origins looks terrible, and that collection, which is actually neat comes only to pc and mobile. Seriously, these are some bad choices :/
Guardians Of The Galaxy looks awesome and the gameplay looks interesting But that was just too much.
WHAT A WASTE 25 MINUTES ON CAPESHIT
Where were Banjo & Kazooie in Kingdom Hearts?! 🐻🦅🗝
i LOVE IT^^
A woman that can feel. We really do live in a society.
Live chat was the best part of this
how is this song called?^^
Muestran un remake de todos los Final fantasy en 2D para moviles y Pc, y no son capaces de hacer un port del Final Fantasy VII Remake para Xbox?
CHAOS
Looking forward to guardians of the Galaxy, it's gonna be great by the looks of it!
0/10.
thank you for absolutely ruining babylon's fall square enix. you never learn how players hate live service games. you still force your studios to make them. it's insane. i hope it flops what more can i say
I rate this showcase a (CHA)0/5
First off I want a Final Fantasy 11 HD remake. And a final fantasy 11 classic server to shut those other moron servers down. Second way to many marvel games..... Sad I didn't get to see Joshua. This wasn't one of your best show's Square.
just give us something xeno related already
damn
I had high expectations for Square Enix, such disappointment.
Worst conference of E3
Best showcase so far. I love Guardians of the Galaxy. Not gonna lie was hoping for a Persona game based to the style of pressing and stuff...
This was so lame..
WTF no new tomb raider game?
Seriously, what is wrong with you all? Why do you always have to complain for almost everything? In my opinion, these are great titles and games that Stand out for Square Enix. But no. You all have to complain and whine and be petty all because you didn't get what you want? Seriously, Grow up and deal with it. If you don't like what you see, just leave. It's that Simple. If you keep complaining and keep whining about it, get a life. Seriously. And even when you get the things you want, you still complain. For the love of everything and everyone be grateful.
FF Origins looks kind of disappointing IMO. Same with Babylon’s Fall. I was hoping for some epic world full of lore and mystery and not what looks like some generic dungeon crawler.
That was impressive that even if the games looked interesting every trailer was so awful that I don't know what to think.
wow that was it, no updates on ff7 part 2 or 16 etc,  most of show was just for gardians of the galaxy, and more avenger stuff.
Square. . .  LEGACY OF KAIN!
I sat through an hour of Marvel cringe and Life is Strange for 2 minutes of FF1 Action Remake. Why do you do this to yourselves, Square Enix?  Why do you do this to us?
I am mostly disappointed in the fact it's like they lied to us about FFXVI, They said they would share more in early 2021...and yet not a peep. What a letdown...
so bad
Worst showcase in E3 history.
Final Fantasy Origins. Nice!
FF origins only one i was interested in
:( That was awful
no doubt playstation has the marketing rights for ff16 and forspoken because of the exclusivity.  next state of play maybe?
Sigh... Not gonna lie, this was a huge letdown... No FF16, no FF7R, no Neo TWEWY, let alone KH.... 😭😭
Love watching the chat warriors cry about games. If you thought SE would do something big for E3 you are sorely mistaken. You know damn well they do their own thing.
Ww want a refund data
UNLEASH THE DISLIKES
Chaos!
Esperaba al juego de los guardianes
F kingdom hearts
I'm hyped for woman simulator
wasted 40 minutes
Dear Square-Enix,  Please just stop.
Nothing that really made me excited unfortunately…
Awful presentation
Well this was disappointing... All I wanted was more info on Neo TWEWY and FFXVi, and possibly a new NieR/Drakengard game. Final Fantasy Origin looks good, as far as action games go, but that's about it.
This was dissapointing
Watching the people cry in live chat with their unrealistic expectations was hilarious
La peor conferencia de la vida al chile xd
came for Forspoken and FF XVI. All I got was 2 seconds each at the end. Thanks square! This had so much potential
I want to kill chaos. This present was actually really nice i want that last game
L
Has anyone noticed that the outro music was the same as Ashley flowers podcast supernatural
Thats it?! Meh
Welp.
No dragon quest ?!
They literally showed the same scenes from Guardians of the Galaxy 3 times on a loop
That was horrible
I don't understand the logic of not releasing FF1-6 on consoles
Nothing about FF7R Part 2... not really surprised sadly
That was the worst E3 show of all time. Congratulations.
Team Ninja always disappoints, but glad to hear that they kept Christopher Sabat as Garland.
where is FF16 ?
are you kidding me lmao, this was awful
Big L
so dull
Most of their games look the same. Should have stopped at Guardians.
the FF origins thing looks sick. too bad they only showed a 2 second clip of FFXVI though. can’t say I wasn’t expecting that from square LOL
Square still doesn't care about TWEWY huh
Where was the tomb raider content
Drakengard remaster?😞
There is a wasted 45 minutes of my life right there.
Looking forward to the final fantasy prequel
marvel presents, where was square enix?
My grandkids graduated college by the time that Guardians of the Galaxy presentation was over
Wtf this no tomb raider
Well that was a waste of time
Pretty garbage lol
Wow that one just sucked...
No Project Triangle Strategy? Maybe it’ll be at Nintendo’s presentation...
What a let down
Why did he say square enix like dat...square ehnix
Worst presentation
another year no legacy of kain. sigh and the wait continues
I want my 45 minutes back....
What the hell was even the point of this?  Should have been called Square Enix Presents Marvel games...  Very disappointed in this presentation.
Trash yet again.
Still waiting for sleeping dogs 2
et ba c’était bien moisi du fion. 😒
Lol, more like Marvel Presents
K bye squeenix
How many times can they say CHAOS?
a
Wow that was disappointing
...that was it?
Absolute trash
Never been more disrespected in my damn life
Bro I hate how everybody is a 13 year old on this because “it’s not what they wanted” don’t keep your hopes up remember that when E3 happens
You suck square Enix is the worst company making exclusives for ps5 when no one can get the damn thing  online only is bullshit Microsoft and Sony should just sell their condolences in stores.
cringe
not sure if im getting older or the games just seem to look shittier every e3
cringe
guardiens of the galaxy got like 20 minutes or even more and life is strange content only 5 minutes...cmon how saaad.
All Might is in Chaos????
i love the life is strange series a lot, but the new one looks kinda meh. hopefully its gonna be better than i think it is
Now presenting devil might cry
P
saw the word heart and nomura and got excited, rip kh fans
Lol wow so boring
Lol
Never expect a SE presentation to be good unless they're presenting with another first party company.  They almost always have the good stuff when presenting with Sony.
Jeez the chat sucks it’s like every game they announce u guys hate it. Personally I think guardians of the Galaxy game looks good
This is painful to watch so far!
God this is terrible
Life is strange remastered barley looks different visually
cringe
Modern women are so detached they have to treat empathy as a super power.
Super lame so far, hope the good stuff is packed right in the last 5 minutes of the show...
Where is quadratum Where's our keyblade wielding boy
From the creators of "The Power of Friendship" comes, "The Power of Empathy".

I've learned Square Enix has the most toxic video game fanbase on the planet
I'm amused by Babylon's Fall's character designer going "it's important that the characters in this high fantasy game are not in the least bit cartoony, instead being 100% realistic" (while giving them the most ridiculous outfits ever, outfits that would look less ridiculous in a less realistic style).
RIP Babylon's Fall.
Remember when square was an eastern developer
Guardian of the galaxy is just Avengers with different name
cringe

Awesome Square Enix Presents Summer Showcase Video.
cringe
Oh god...not more life is strange. It's so horrible
cringe
cringe
where the mf Spider-Man dlc for avengers
Where is Fortnite 2?
Well at least we are finally getting FF1 and 2 for Steam after so many years.
Is it too much to ask for Tomb Raider 1-5 remake 😭
My soul has left my body
I’m so hyped for the ff1-6 collection and Babylon’s fall
so.. Avengers, Guardians, Babylon.... same game, different skins. Once the cash grab is finished, please start working on Deus Ex 3
"Final Fantasy 1-6 remastered" I'm listening... "For mobile" Nevermind
When are Square Enix going to upgrade there engine all games look same as they did 3 - 4 years ago
Snoozefeast
'It belongs to the ethnostate !'
AMONG US?!?! 😳😳😳😳😳
FF16 where?
i really want dying light 2
Screw you you haven't told us anything about Spider man's dlc for avengers
No release date 4 black panther
cringe
Wow this showcase is so bad….Square Enix, what happened?
why no 4k stream dammit
square enix litterally wasted 24 minutes purely on Marvel. who trought advertising it as the first thing was a good idea???? from a company perspective they litterally dont show one of their own games as the first, but disney. this is like a hour. not hard to mess it up.
Square Enix, we don't want Marvel games, we want quality new jRPGs or quality remasters for consoles.

This show sucks
i came here for JRPGS YO. what is all this marvel bs haha
Seriously only 20 seconds of Final Fantasy footage!!?? Come on that’s my favorite series
You idiots. You are redoing the first 6 final fantasies but not putting them on consoles? Morons. You failed us like you always do.
Square Enix, we don't want Marvel games, we want quality new jRPGs or quality remasters for consoles.
Marvel presents featuring square enix
I'll die before I see anything related to ff16 geee
Change the name to Avenger show
So far Guardians of the Galaxy genuinely manages to look worse than Marvel Avengers. Which is impressive, to say the least. I don't  get why they spent so much time on it, after how hard Avengers flopped I would have thought they'd try to sweep it and GotG under the rug as best as they can.
TOO MUCH
SQUEENIX STOP THE MARVEL
So no switch or ps4 release for those pixel remasters? What a missed opportunity..
I'm ready for Life is Strange True Colors and Remastered!!!
20 minutes of Avengers 2.0 when all the world dislike the Avengers game. "Is this supposed to be a a Showcase or is it some sort of joke?"
Should have kept my expectations in check
Okaaaaaay ya'll we get it. This is the longest reveal I've ever seen I feel like.
You can only play as star lord????
just remember what Eric Cartman said about Preordering....
cringe
This is what I needed 🤩 after that boring xbox presentation 😃
God even if this so far is focused on gotg I hate the live chat it so unbelievably toxic
I just want to see some Kingdom Hearts, Verum Rex, NEO TWEWY, and FF16.
stop this guardians things really
spent way too much time on the gotg game, also doesn’t help that it looked kinda bland
Man I'm keeping my expectations mid.
So all the budget of gotg went to the licensing fees of the music and definitely not the gameplay lmao
Lame
Jake Paul as Starlord...
FF Origin? 🤐
Update every reveal 1. Guardian of the Galaxy IS 🤮🤮!!! This reveal is PAINFUL to watch! Like wtf was square thinking 😵 We don't even get the cast from the movies. Not to mention I don't even think you can play as all 5 🤦  2. Let's go classic ff on PC and mobile 🤩🤩 and legend of mana too 🤤  3. Seriously square more effing marvel ☹️  4. Tbh idk wtf that was 😄  5. NEW MOBILE NIER AND FF 😱😱🤤🤤  6. Idk the FF shooter looking a bit promising 😶  7. I can't say the name for the life of me but babylon something got me hyped asf and the combat is styled off of NIER automata 👍  8. YESSSS!! LIFE IS STRANGE REMASTERED COLLECTION 🤩🤩 and and WE'RE GETTING A NEW GAME 😩😩  9. Idk wtf stranger of paradise is but it is related to ff 👍  10. Lastly its just a recap of everything from this event, future releases that we already know about, and current titles that you can buy
Hoping for a kh and amogum crossover so sora can get that massive snussy
I guess they didn't secure the likeness rights to Chris Pratt.
Starlord looks like such a douchebag
These guardians of the galaxy look kinda different. I like it but I am confused
Everyone: Final Fantasy XVI ? SquareEnix: NO
I’ll be honest, the game overall is pretty meh, dialogues are good tho
I really hope SE has more planned than guardians cause this looks terrible
Idk I just wish they could reskin them to look like the actual movie characters.
Just Cause news maybe?
Does anyone know how long will this conference be ?
Why the F GoG announcement going on and on 😵😵😵
Metal banger in the background in the guardians presentation, anyone happens to know the track??
What about Outriders? Or have you taken as a loss already?
Who here for life is strange remastered ? :D
Drax perk: Become invisible if not moving.
Best thing of the Guardians game is the music... the rest is crap.
Where is the other girl
Keep the mask on Quill...much better.
Does anyone else hate Gamora's hair in this new game?
I want Gamora to sit on my face
Kingdom hearts pleaaaaase!
What is wrong with Gamora walking animation.
Triangle Strategy, I beg of you
SQUEENIX ON MY SCREENIX
this is what happens when old people make new games LMAO
Amazing thats the game (GuardiansOTG)  market needs thank you Square Enix.
@Sam_33zZ - Twitter: found glitch at beginning of ps5 Ratchet & Clank secret real estate . Check it out!
If this show is 80% guardians of the galaxy I’ll be pissed

An OAth to return Verum REx
Not even premiered and there's someone saying "boo dead game nobody cares" in the live chat. Seriously the live chat sometimes. And now I saw someone saying "cancel this game in the live chat." That's it I have determined that it is Karens in the live chat
FF15 PLEASE
Life is Strange more like People Are Strange
I'm hoping for a Kingdom Hearts hd collection on Switch
Multiplayer option for megahives!
siiii
KINGDOM HEARTS
FF7 remake for pc incoming          edit: i lied. :(
DRAGON QUEST PLEASEEEEEEE
Just give me ff news man
I do know of some FF remastered games that are coming if you watched the Japanese broadcast a few weeks ago
FFXIV FOR xbox?
FF13
Please some good Final Fantasy stuff.
Even though it was just announced a few weeks ago, I hope they'll give us a release date for the DQ3 remake.
FFXVI!
Who else is here for an Ergheiz announcement... lol
Chrono Trigger Remake and im in Tears
Tomb raider?
GMDX.
I'll be cool with just anything final fantasy , kingdom hearts or legacy of Kain related.
Pls just release an open world RPG with all the characters from all final fantasies, including the mobile games because the Rain and Lasswell story is great.
Drakengard 4 ?
hopefully all this mana is back thing leads to a new mana game
English: I'm the only one hoping for a Chrono Trigger remaster?! or is a war already ended? XD. Español: Soy el unico esperando un remaster de chrono trigger?! o es una batalla ya perdidad ajajaja!?
I wish they would make a Xenogears remake but my heart tells me it’s not happening  Edit: god damnit
If they're not going to make remakes of the classic final fantasies at least port them to current consoles😭
Final Fantasy Soulslike.
They should do a full remake of every dragon quest/ FF title. It worked wonders for Links Awakening. It's working for Resi. It'd be amazing
PLEASE MORE ABOUT FINAL FANTASY XVI 🤩
It's still a year away, but I really hope to see Triangle Strategy today!
Fnaf 2
READY FOR THE MOSH PIT SHAKA BRAH?
Ready for DQ12
Hype!
Hoping for an Spider-Man reveal for Avengers,  maybe a peak at she-hulk too
¿Alguien más espera Life is strange True colors?
i have a feeling we should keep our expectations on what is listed above.
Kingdom Hearts... Please...
Chrono Trigger for any Console. Please release it again. Imo the best RPG ever made.
FINAL FANTASY XVI
Would love a Vagrant Story remake. ^^
DQXII 🤞  Edit: after watching presentation- no we didn't 😒😫
When are you going to update final fantasy IX for iOS?
Forspoken, pls, i‘m dying for that game.  Edit: …it was just the worst show.
GEX
woke fantasy XVI Women cant have breast anymore
(anticipates Kingdom Hearts news and readies my clown makeup)
Really hope Eidos led the next Tomb Raider. I don't care what y'all say Shadow was the best game of the reboot since I was shooting someone every 5 seconds and actually got to raid tombs
Tifa hentai the game ?!
Looking forward to seeing more TWEWY Neo. At a wild shot I'd love to see more Final Fantasy Tactics.
BLACK PANTHER AND GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY
Ff7 remake part two hopefully
I want a New Groove Coaster for Steam Game!
So looking forward to being let down with no Deus Ex
GEX 🦎 & Chrono Kriss Kross confirmed for Playdate

If only Final Fantasy VII: Ever crisis isn't a gacha mobile game....   Infinity undiscovery total remake with co op would be nice.  The rumored Final fantasy Souls-like game would be great too.  FF VI remake with Octopath traveller and FFRK soul break skills... an impossible dream, right?  Oh, and thank you for Bravely default 2. It is truly a timeless masterpiece =)
Final fantasy VIII Remake Please 😁
Hoping to see more of FFXVI, a tease of the next KH game, and maybe some FFVII Part 2.Thisis a tall order though. I only expect to see one of these. But a man can dream.
That final fantasy origin rumor better be real
Give us final fantasy xvi gameplay trailer..this is why we follow square..for jrpgs and final fantasy and dragon quest most of all

Super unlikely. But Star Ocean 6... maybe? Besides kh and ff. I would love star ocean.  Edit: I mean. If it follows with its current trend of one new game per console, it would make sense. Since SO3 was ps2, SO4, on ps3, SO5 on ps4... haha. Heres hoping the series still is alive enough to warrent another game, thanks to it's app game keeping the community alive.
Cloud ☁️🙌💕😍😘😵🤚
My hopes: A glimpse at what’s next for Kingdom Hearts and if not that then FFVII Remake Part 2 teaser or a new trailer for NEO TWEWY!
