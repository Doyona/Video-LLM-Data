Who do you want to see AJ fight next?
The refs shirt at the end of the match says it all.  This was no easy win
Franklin suprise AJ got skillz💯 nice fight:.
Great fight AJ looked a bit pressured 😊
What a joke
This isn’t Joshua being gun shy, he’s being defensively responsible and picking his shots precisely, he’s just not as reckless as he used to be, this Joshua would have had a different fight with Dubois
This AJ would have beaten Daniel.
should have stayed with Derrick James
Never rated AJ from the start
Look at the difference from this fight to now under Ben Davison Joshua actually has spite and power in his punches again and is not pop shottingn
If feanklin can do this well then DD can beat AJ
You all keep.dreaming for your wilder. Wilder is a loser to AJ. Dont you all see AJ is having fun in this match?
11:35 Ben Davidson in the background shaking his head. They are an amazing team now.
8:00 that's how Austin McBroom thought his boxing events attendance would look like 😂😂😂😂😅😅😅
AJ hitting & holding the entire fight. And that poor excuse for a ref was pathetic! AJ looks robotic, it looks like he doesn't even want to be in there.
I'd like to see Franklin in with Ortiz or Martin!
Close fight but the better man won tonight. Bodybuilder will not make it with the big guys.
Franklin is not easy for Joshua at all
Reading the comments a year later is hilarious considering what happened to Wallin and Ngannou
AJ got the hight advantage . Franklin is really something else man was ready to go another 10 round ❤. The hight advantage got him
Jermaine Franklin has some serious skills
They announcers never mentioned ONCE how franklin Busted Joshuas Nose Up. Dispite All the Blood on Aj's Trunks. Trunks turned dam Near RED, so did the Refs Shirt, lol🤣
why is AJ holding his head and punching him same time
This was great fight by both fighters it really helped AJ
Franklin did a fantastic job, aj forget about it, washed up has been... Should go retire... Recently he's just fought a bunch of bums, put him up against usyk and he will send him to his knees again. There's a reason Usyk is an elite level fighter. Think about that!
Josowa ❤❤❤
Commentators totally ignored every big punch that Franklin landed haha
AJ is scared of being hit thats why he kept on clinching Franklin!
Jermaine has grits. Factory work does help one build stamina
Frankclin bon boxeur
The Ben Davison version is 3 times better. Derrick James is a scam
Champion de kasumbalesa
Looking back on this. Joshua fought this really well. Franklin is legit as he did best Dillian whyte but got robbed.
Beetle juice is impressive. I knew he had it in him.
Is that Beetlejuice(Beet) against Joshua?
Look at what Parker did to Wilder. Wilder ain’t got it no more
Thought AJ fought a smart fight, Franklin was no joke .
Bias commentary
Super boring fight.
AJ's jab is gettibg better and better😊
this underperformance that people are talking about i don't really see it here.... i just feel this was a highly technical display of a jab by joshua ... if fury boxed like this the pundits and the media would be saying something different.. give joshua grieve about not knocking down franklin i can work with that .. but saying this was an underperformance i disagree..
aj v fury
AJ needs more straight rights if he wants to fight at range.
scared to throw punches, scared to let his hands go
Joshua vs Sanchez would be a barn burner.
Wilder avoided Franklin.
95% cuddling.
Ruiz reduced AJ:s confidence but Usyk eradicated it
Wilder
What bad fight. It was too boring
Joshua dari segi fisik, postur badan tinggi kekuatan dan kecepatan sangat bagus...kekurangan nya adalah insting membunuh lawan duluan tidak ada pada dirinya...seperti video ini, dia harus perbanyak memukul dan sering lepas jab...
Notice how they cut out AJ acting like a total fecking disrespectful dic at the end of the fight
Another boring display of wrestling 😂
Franklins overhand at 6:52 doesn’t seem to do any damage 😮
AJ has turn a very lazy fither now
Just another heavyweight against someone I hadn't heard of? Fury was waiting, in fact many of the top heavyweights were waiting..
Franklin is not bad at all , respect !
Franklin’s counterpunching was excellent, he didn’t allow AJ to bully him, but he didn’t seem to put it all together to win rounds. Severely out-thrown and moderately out-landed. Still, deserves respect
this Aj fight wasnt really bad,infact he fiught well by picking his shot and knowing when to get aggressive, the expectations are too high on him simply cuz of how he was fighting b4,,however this brother has evolved and getting better at his craft. Big ups AJ..love 4m Naija -Nigeria-
Stinker! 💩
AJ can't stand against Deontay Wilder or Fury with his current form.
How many times did A.J. Grab him behind the back of the head and uppercut? I always thought that was illegal?
I've been blind all my life but can see Joshua has lost his bottle..nothing left for him except Grindr
He fights like Lennox Lewis now, but the difference is that Lewis has a better Jab and a dynamite and a laser like of a straight and Anthony doesn't have that.
Technically Joshua is better
AJ would be best calling it a day he will have no chance against wilder or Fury even if they was having a bad day how he won this I don’t known
I always waiting for AJ fighting...
Joshua looked better here than in the Hilanius fight imo.
dazns aj biased commentary is unbearable
Aj is no longer lethal as he used to be. He gets too tired early! Is it the vaccine or jabs effect. Surely these jabs have finished our sports guys!
I purchased plenty of lager crisps and nuts, then invited 5 friends over to watch paint dry, That was infinitely more exciting than watching that boring clown Joshua.
There is NO WAY A.J. will beat Wilder with a performance like that. How was that a 12 round match? Wilder has zero boxing skills and even I think he could KO Josh now. Appalling, he has a real genuine reluctance to step on his opponents toe and clout a big right. The Only weapon in his arsenal that can win him matches and he hardly uses it.
Derrick James is overrated
Sadly Joshua has No foot Work  No Handspeed  And IS Not rthrowing hard fast combinations Somehow He lost the fire   ITS Strange that He is Not watching Roy Jones Jr Fights Or Ali Fights  If He wants to Box Like George Foreman then He needs to Punch brutaly hard with combinations   Also his defense ist very Open für counter strikes
Helenius knocks out Joshua in the first round
Franklin's chin man, jheeeeez. Some of those uppercuts would've flattened the majority of HWs
1:55 2:40 2:58
If Joshua loses to Helenius he's cooked.
02:41 was a nice counter combination from AJ
Joshua so afraid to get hit ....it stiffens him in hus movements
Everyone who says a.j has a glass chin are serious haters lol this was a great performance from a.j.. I just wish he would close the distance more and work on the inside with his uppercuts and use his power and speed but I'm no pro so obviously after coming off 2 losses this was a great fight one sided
Another 6"2 fighter he couldn't knock out. Wilder is going to smash AJ
If AJ fights Wilder & gets caught with the same right hand Franklin landed in the 11th (10:17) round AJ is going to sleep for sure.
Joshua avait un physique d'acier un monstre mais aujourd'hui c'est au autre boxeur surtout à cause de son mental et son premier échec contre ruiz
AJ didnt enjoy the fight

Who would you want to see AJ fight next?
Aj wanted to fight after the 12th round
i think joshua era is over . .
Biden
AJ needs food work and defense more than anything.  He was a bully before and got caught with men woth quicker hand speed. He needs to use movement feints and fluidity to fight those typenof guys.. too stiff.. needs confidence.. also dont forget ur old style.. it was effective still.
Anda peliando bn Antoni
7:26 aj needs this head movement in a fury fight
wilder W or L retire...👍
I think Joshua is still the most explosive heavyweight, in the final , in the final minutes of the 12th round Aj wanted to push to another gear a glimpse of old Aj with brains but Franklin held on knowing he can't sustain than pace 😅😅😅😅 smart Franklin
Aj's defence is getting better with Derrick James
Usyk too joshuas soul
I like this joshua better he’s picking his punches being more accurate. We watching a mature fighter. Ik everyone wants him to go back to the old joshua but he’s older now gotta be smart.being careless is why he’s not champ no more.
Big win by AJ! 👏👏👏🫡
Джошуа второй Кличко
Aj as to let his hands go often he is holding back alot this time around
If Joshua just had an American trainer..
❤❤❤
Joswa ❤❤
Joshua is like a robot.
Joshua need some stamina not flowing like water
11:48 "the champion" look at how another man is become a fearless fighter ... how fierce and explosive he was after win against Wladimir, who thanks to him became world champion. And after the match with Ruiz he became a fearless fighter.. a man who became champion by a lucky upercut in 11 round defeating an old world heavyweight champion who defend his titles for 10 YEARS and was known to be close to retirement Wladimir Klitscho... and AJ will not have the chance to become champion again, because he will never be able to defeat Usyk, Fury or Wilder
UK commentators are extremely biased. They don't aren't acknowledging Franklin's work. 😮
Snap you right hand back to guard faster after the crosses bruv.
Joshua is now frank bruno😂
I miss the ferocious AJ....he f around to much round per round in my opinion. He can easily smash everyone like tyson did...but nope. I get that his style is boxing in "perfection" but idk....can't see the fire in him no more like in early few fights. Confidence was replaced with focus i guess.
Josh looked scared
Wow! He look scared! Every feint AJ is flinching...... If he loses again he should retire! UK dont want another Audley Harrison for a stepping stone.
he’s not fighting better, he’s boxing better
He will be great with coach James. He just to stiff
AJ is getting old too slow he should KO in 8 rounds
Don't know when AJ is going to get the "mongrel" back ....I'm starting to think it's not going to happen ..he just isn't firing anymore , he's lost his nerve, unless he just throws caution to the wind and an not worry about whether he wins or loses just fight , be an inteligent brawler even , be an inside fighter ....he's going to fade out ...he needs , they all do have a fight few times a year ....Mike Tyson had him the one to beat earlier on ....now he doesn't even mention him ..the current heavyweight line up are going to retire of old age soon if they don't all get knocked out game by new up and coming talent ....
Joshua getting hit this easily by a guy like Franklin is concerning for him if he ever faces Wilder.
Come on ant your better then this
He fought with a very short guy.will loose with any guy as tall as him.he take this fight for that reason to win
ikisi de elinden geleni yaptı güzel maçtı
I'm afraid AJ is more wooden than a wooden spoon.
Having Derrick James as his head coach made him better imo
Joshua haters keep watching him
The score card in this was outrageous. It was a competitive fight. Honestly pretty even. It was entertaining and these guys have ability levels just outside the top 10.  Any proper top 10 talent beats either of these guys. Fury, usyk, wilder or even sanchez beats these guys comfortably   These men are still in the top 15 of any man on the planet which makes them tanks. But not the best in the world. Which is no shame whatsoever!
Joshua's best days are behind him, sorry
Wilder joshua’nın  içinden geçer
AJ isnt back. Ruiz ruined his fight instinct. If he was back he would have knocked him out, like old AJ would.
He's not ready yet to fight with wilder or furry
I don’t see how people support Joshua lol . He’s ducks all the tough competition smh
The bias towards AJ in the commentary is a joke
9:18 - THE reason why Wilder would spark AJ
AJ next fight is going to be a YouTuber
Until now i think AJ still not enough to be no.1
der schlechteste Kampf von Joshua !!!
Kanonenfutter !!
elementary school
Technically excellent from  Joshua
If he stands like that in front of wilder it’s lights out
A bunch of casuals in this comment section! Boxing is not all about slugfests and knockouts!
No ❤️
Aj movement too slow..and it take longer round to nock opponent down...isbit cos of vaccination covic his immunity down?
Why does AJ have two first names? Why does his current trainer have two first names? Anthony, Joshua, Derrick and James. That's 4 different negroes in his training camp at the same time. Overcrowded.
Ruiz Jr ended AJs carrier. He moves like a 100 year old sequoia tree 😂. Scared to get rocked, he should retire.
A lot of you in this comment section are just talking thrash. Making very idiotic statements because you have no boxing sense about the sweet science, so you can't appreciate the sweet science. What you are actually watching is Joshua actually winning the fight with 1 hand, and that is the left hand. He actually beat Franklin with 1 hand and not even 2. The second hand was hardly thrown and  hardly landed and the only time it did Franklin was wobbled. It is sad that you guys can't appreciate what you just watched. In the past AJ beat people with both hands and knocks them out. Now he is trying to beat them decisively with 1 hand. Look how many left uppercuts he threw. AJ and DJ are really working on something unique and I think he is preparing him on how to fight South paws. The more the left hand becomes as deadly and explosive as his right hand. The HW is in trouble. Know this and know peace, he actually beat Franklin with 1 hand.
Still su....s and is boring
Я б хотів побачити Джошуа в бою проти Уайдлера або Фьюрі
Joshua is a Bruno for the modern era 😂
I think the boxer he knocked out Klitschko has died. We are watching a different boxer.....
Hakem joshua'nın galibiyetine yardımcı olmuş halbuki rahatlıkla kazanabileceği bir rakip
Where is blood come from?
ah
He need more fight to build his confidence   I believe he will get is confidence back with the new trainer
Aj fight like a broomstick with gloves…
You can tell that at the end he did not care about the win, it was meaningless. AJ take millions and run
🎉🎉🎉man city for life
Andy Ruiz actually broke AJ,  AJ  now fights scared  with way too much extreme caution ..
AJ can never bet Tyson from uk 🇬🇧 😅
Brillanace in defence joshua shows here
Tyson fury may perhaps have is work cut for him given this performance, I'd say this probably the best heavy weight I've seen for a long long time, and to come back off his history, credit to Joshua, this is a different Joshua, and in reality I've not seen defence like this of him before. Tyson fury, this is a man worth fighting
Franklin was a beast
Joshua boring his opponents to death to secure a win 😆
Who should he fight next? Nobody! He should retire! His legs are gone, when he gets punched he just stands there or tries to hug/hold. It’s very sad to see him fighting now.
I really want to see a rematch with Usyk also now Wilder Joshua. I loved this match
Goes to show that changing trainers don't mean much, as the fighter makes the final call in the ring at the end of the day. If it were a big factor though, expect Terence Crawford to knock Errol Spence out into space
Just retire
Joshua’s finished
Nice to see the spirit of the Frank Bruno's school of boxing's alive & well!
I can see the improvements in certain areas but this is his first fight with dj and he is still thinking about what he needs to do when and if those things can become second nature but one of the most important things he needed seems to be under control his stamina i saw a very composed aj even when franklin went on the attack aj stayed composed very important 3 or 4 more fights with more improvements aj might be a real problem
AS COMPARED ALL ROUND FRANKLIN BETTER PLAY APPROX 1 TO 8 ROUND .LAST 4 ROUND IS GIVE TO JOSHUA ..MY OPINION JOSHUA WIN DECLARE FORCEFULLY OTHER WISE FRANKLIN WAS WIN
Aj sekarng sdh gk asik lg semenjka kekalahan pertama dgn Andy Ruiz mental langsung down tak bs pulih
Watched the fight back. Its not actually as bad as i thought innitially. He moved very fluidly,  picked his punches well, wasnt  making dumb decisions some haters were expecting him to make and he was agressive where need be. Great fight. Hater will always hate though but No One cares for their bias opinions 😂😅
Legs is terriblee
Just watched white vs Joshua 2015 fight.  Joshua was so different then.   More confident,  not scared to throw punches.  Ruiz loss has him on the defensive all the time now.  Not his natural style.  He's a predator
Ruiz destroyed AJ's boxing career
I will suggest AJ to join Floyd camp
AJ was much better in his last fight with Usyk
Pathetic
I can't watch AJ after his cringe speech
Any top 5 rank heavyweight boxer would beat AJ hands down, AJ is so slow in all his moves 🐢🐢🐢
The old AJ would have finished this guy in 5 rounds. This guy has become like Broner, he doesn’t let his hands go. He has zero chance in beating Wilder.
Zhang far more elite than J.franklin is
Wasn't a bad performance, bit cagey but he won every round, picked his shots and was in full control. Don't write AJ off just yet - he still has the power.
Maybe if he wouldn't have been a mouthpiece for BLM and concentrated on his boxing ... can't stand AJ now hope he never wins another title
I really thought joshua was going to bring all belts together as champ but not any more 😔
He saved his face from the mat, AJ was like a surgeon
If AJ fights Tyson fury Tyson will teach him how to fight Tyson will knock him out 4 round there isn’t a boxer out there that would not beat Tyson fury
I think AJ looks very "composed" rather than "afraid".  I feel like franklin was struggling to even get close to touching AJ.
He is build like a tank Whit so much power but he dosent have the balls of fury nor the heart!!
Jeez,  The way that Joshua fought against Franklin, is how he fight,s now, a points win against 29th ranked Franklin means absolutely nothing, he took Franklin over Whyte, because he was seen as the easiest option, Ruiz, has made him gunshy, & he is scared/afraid/frightened to let his hand go, when he gets in with Wilder, he wil get knocked out in 4/5 rounds.
Yeah he's not the boxer he once was. He's not got the confidence and flair that Ruiz knocked out of him.  But better to have been the AJ of yesterday for a day, than the AJ of today for a lifetime.
Aj is shook… bow out son
AJ is more skillful than before. However, his punch is not powerful like before because his muscle is smaller than before.
This was his most boring fight yet 😴
Give credit or just criticism where its due. Joshua will never, get over ,mentally, from the loss to flabby Andy Ruiz and Usyk. Its the trauma  that happened to Mike Tyson when Buster Douglas, shattered Tyson's "iron" coating. He never recovered.
Joshua has totally lost it. Looking to his corner, every time he get’s clocked.  Holding & hitting, punching on the break.  Disgraceful.
Joshua vs Wilder  win vs Fury
Aj is like twice this guys size.
Joshua fight scared now. He is so cautious and hesitant he is boring to watch now
Amazing angle 1:10
Man I wish he had fought like this against Ruiz Jr the second time 😂
AJ is professional athlete. All losers on the couch judging remember that
This is a win for Franklin honestly🤡🥊
13:43 of highlights I guess 13:42 was my favorite moment cause I knew this was over¡ 🤡🥊
Francis would sleep this guy quick like¡😴
That had to be the worst referee I’ve seen. AJ grabbed Franklins behind the head several times and uppercut him. I understand you don’t want to get in between heavyweights, but you can’t allow that.
Highlights finished upload, slow internet connection reason
Уважаю Джошуа как человека,но к Фьюри ты не готов.
Joshua JUST BORING 😴
Joshua dominated this guy who had a close fight with Whyte, and all I see are people whining about his performance.
Andy Ruiz caused all this.
Aj has openly stated he sees boxing as a career, he's in it to make money etc. Fair enough, but it shows in his fighting, everyone wants a passionate boxer
People don't understand styles Ruiz, Usyk and Franklin are all different levels of counter punchers who counter with combinations and fast hands, hence Joshua being more efficient with his punches which appears hesitant, but this is exactly how you fight counterpunchers you can not be wasteful throwing punches because 3 to 4 will be returning if you miss. Watch Franklin v Whyte highlights to see what happens when you try to slug it out.
Why does he keep getting matched with shorter faster fighters? He always struggles against that style.
I think that's a bit embarrassing from aj he is done put him against the top 3 fighters he only getting ko loved him watched all his fights but get the money from any fight u get offered and retirement is your destiny
Most overrated boxer in history
Imagine what Evander Holyfield would have done against this Joshua.
Joshua has lost his dog.
Joshua looks like he checked out das not champion behavior the only great that never lost is money may boy need to pick his head
He should be winning these easy 🤦🏻‍♂️
What happened to you AJ, you changed its like your scared to throw hands bro 😢
easy work for AJ
AJ fought well
Aj needs to keep fighting Cab drivers and build his confidence back up, atleast 10 more
Today's heavyweights are all bums.
He can't fight eny more
I almost fell asleep watching this fight. I loved Anthony Joshua as a person, but his movements are stiff and he’s slow and boring.   This guy was supposed to be an easy win but it went the distance.
Wassup with the punches after the bell AJ😭🤣
Any of the big name wilder or fury would crush AJ he doesn't have the bottle or the heart
Booooooo......
Aj beats usyk in next match Aj beats fury in 10 round ko Aj gets wilder in 8
The full fight is just never gonna be uploaded is it?
This is what Joshua needs at the end of the day everyone saying he less aggressive he doesn’t need to be he needs to throw more and in combination this is one of his best performances he actually put it together instead of 1-2 combos he needs to build and add more
AJ not my favourite anymore 😢
Ruiz took out the lion in joshua
Didn't even know this fight happened
Joshua is dead, and can't recover himself. He can't fight Wilder or Fury like this. I can't find any improvement in this dude😢
Big Joshua fan, been watching him since amateur days. I’ll always back him and im from NC lol. My favorite modern heavyweight. Hope he gets to fight wilder and beats him.
My shadow boxing is more entertaining for people than this.
I can be knock out josua n furry if i was stiilll young sure
Kid chose the fame over the glory, this the price you pay.
"Once AJ learns how to box he'll be back on top" -An actual sentiment about a man in his 30s
AJ must quit boxing and play Rugby. Plus his body would fit perfectly on Rugby. As far as boxing is concerned, I don't see him winning against Deontay Wilder or Tyson Fury 🆗  He is simply not the star that we all thought he would be🤞🏾
Watching AJ fight like this is very discouraging. He wants to adopt the jabbing style of dmitri bivol but his defense is very poor. He doesn’t move around a lot and he always waits for the wrong timing to execute a counter attack… he can’t win against any wilder with is style 🙄
Joshua Semenjak Kawin Dengan istri Muda a Kemampuan a Dalam Ber Tinju Sangat Turun Drastis,,Kabar a istri Muda a Mintak Jatah 3x Malam Dan 2x Siang .😅😅😅
Wilder and Tyson beats AJ 🥴💯
AJ ...You lose ..
Finally AJ beats some boxer...
Should've given them 3 more Rounds as an option, if both Fighters agreed.
50 /50 !! Waiting all....
I couldn't watch it
Is this slowed down. Neither of them have championship pace.
Lets not forget AJ couldnt even hurt a guy who looks like he eats every meal at McDonalds for 15years straigth.
To be fair I see some nice boxing from both of them and mabe some people might think AJ has lost it but I see improvement in what he is trying to do to there trying to teach him how to cover up from a couple of shots  right and left over the top for instance and in doing this is making AJ look a bit tentative but I think he is improving
Franklin has an amazing hearth
Ruiz ate AJ’s soul thats the reason Ruiz got more chubby
He needs his eye of the tiger back
Its hard to do road work at 5 am when youre sleeping in silk sheets. - Marvin Hagler
AJ has no jab and no confidence.  Lewis or Fury would have jabbed the smaller man's face off.
Very lazy fight, I'm not impressed at all 😃
AJ DONT WANT IT WITH FURY OR WILDER
AJ  is a great boxer. You don't have to knock-out every time. Keep in the game Joshua. I would like to see Franklin vs Fury. So Fury can get proper opponents!
Frank Bruno 2.0
AJ making Bruno look slick here 🙈
If he goes in with Wilder based on the first round here it ends very bad !!
AJ is a pray for the Gipsy King who is not afraid AJ now. Gipsy King for years avoided AJ and now he can possibly beat him or NOT. I wish to see Usyk bets them both simultaneously 🙂
He's not in the top 5 anymore.
I've realised now why joshua is such a poor boxer.  He goes in there to defend, and that's it, he doesn't go in there to fight.  Then he just hopes, if he goes the distance, that that'll secure him a win.
Why is he this slow then?
He better stay away from the likes of Fury, Wilder and maybe even White this time around
Wilder would knock out both of them with one shot
Aj win on Franklin was clear in comparison to whyte
Franklin looks like the guy who should replace Chisora as the gatekeeper. He's not a bad fighter.
Didn’t even know he had a fight 🤷🏿‍♂️. Too bad we never got to see that wilder fight.
Not Impressed!
Ruiz really changed this man. But his fight with Klitschko is what I think was the precursor to him becoming tentative. He took some shots where I think it did more than just daze him, his gas tank was called into question as well, and it made him tentative. The Ruiz fight made the suspicions true. And now we’re witnessing a tentative fighter. I wouldn’t call him scared, but the lack of letting his hands go leads me to assume he thinks counter punching/picking shots is the way to go for his career now. Saves him more energy for later rounds, and it doesn’t allow him to get hit as often considering his chin is questionable. Sad to see
Anthony Joshua can't fight any of the big guys in boxing and win. And that's facts
С фьюри тебе ,Антон ,ловить нечего,он тебя раскатает за 3 раунда.
Научите Джошуа бить под разноименную ногу,чтоб бил правой под шаг левой ,и  левой рукой под шаг правой ногой....он в движении бить не умеет.
Float like a butter dish sting like a b iatch
AJ is slow,has a lot of ring rust,losses as well,no anger,no mean intentions. But it’s just my opinion…
like to see John Fury versus Anthoirny Joshue
I think AJ is just trying to be calm not to lose again
Usyk took AJ’s heart! Definitely not the same fighter.
Wow
People talk so much cr-p about this fight, was a decent performance and the second half of the fight very exciting. It wasn’t boring or cagey and Franklin is a sneaky decent fighter, he just beat dillian whyte.
AJ SHOULD JUST  RETIRE NOW.
First of all, you have to understand that Jermaine Franklin had no business in the same ring as him.  You would have thought of Joshua, like a ballet dancer,   boxed on tiptoe. Small jumps in moderate time, somersaults, down to earth, without allegro.  I have nothing against Jermaine Franklin. He couldn't do better. His record remains intact for never having been knocked out in his career.  Remember, Joshua was a 12-1 favorite to take the win. He had promised to retire from boxing if he lost. Sure, he didn't lose, but his victory didn't make him more famous.  All told, Joshua will add nearly fifteen million (US) to his fortune of over $113 million pounds.  Not bad for a 36 minutes of work under TV reflectors.  And now,  that he has found his way to victory, he allows himself to challenge the WBC champion, Tyson Fury. If Fury ever accepts, Joshua will be wobbled, or if you like better: He will be beaten to the hilt if he doesn't  looking after himself.  How to explain that a pugilist who swept away everything in his path as an amateur to finally win the gold medal at the London Olympics in 2012, and then become world champion among the pros, can he become so amorphous in a fight? Admittedly, Joshua had every chance of getting the knockout to his rival.  Why didn't he? Where is this ferocity that we once knew about him?  After all, he has 22 knockout wins during his career, but no knockouts in his last five outings. For what?  Out of pity? Out of recklessness? By incapacity? For lack of will? For lack of heart…? I don't know  It's true that he competed against Oleksandr Usyk on two occasions, but he could have handed the courtesy to Andy Ruiz and finished Jermaine Franklin, but no, he decided to tap dance.  What I do know is that it's better to listen to the advice of Barry Hearn from Matchroom Boxing and not accept  stooges, but second-class pugilists.  Currently, following this performance against Franklin, it is obvious that he would not last long against a Tyson Fury, an Oleksandr Usyk, or a Deontay Wilder, or a Joe Joyce. No, I would see him against a Daniel Dubois, Frank Sanchez, Zheillei Zhang, Trevor Bryan and Arslanbek Makhmudov.  His young audience is calling for him, unlike the older ones who would like to see him face Dillian Whyte again, whom he has already defeated by technical K.-O.  in the seventh round in 2015. Whyte is now 35 years old and he is boxing simply in the hope of increasing his retirement pension.
Has AJ gone all Frank Bruno? At one point I thought he could beat Fury, but at this level I don't think he would beat Joyce.
When I used to do amateur boxing in my teens I used to love it when they would hug up with me. For 3 or 4 days before I wouldn't shower and my pits used to stink and I used to rub them all over the guys head they would always get so mad and it affected their game
Usyk took this guys soul, AJ if u reading this please retire, you are boring us half to death, Wilder would knock you spark out and Fury would box Circles around you, you are not even 3rd or 4th best . you are done
🔥💪💞👏👍❤️🔥🔥
You can see AJ is working on new things so that’s positive. Let’s see what he looks like in his next fight.
Was that a fair fight other dude is like 6 inches taller?
13mins of highlights? Surprising 😴
Nice fight 👏  😂
Everyone is a critic in these comments yet you don’t know the preparations for the matches you don’t know what his corner told him so pipe down🤣
If these were the highlights I'm glad I didn't watch the fight!
Something changed in Aj since that lose
Anthony Joshua SUCH A BAD BOXER! A BODY BUILDER IS HE NOT A BOXER!
He should have never ran to the Mexicans. The Mexican style do not match his abilities.
This commentator really needs to shut up
“Me and that Lennox yeah, we’re cut from a different cloth” Joshua may still not know what’s going on Ukraine except it’s a bit bad..but he atleast understands his place against an actual great former world champion👍🏽
What a fight congrats to both they show heart
Anthony Groot Joshua with that robotic shyte 😆 🤣
Aj is shi. Worst boxer ever
How many DAZN pay per view customers have they just lost . A.J. look mentally unfit.
This is the kind of performance AJ needs to bring, not reckless with how he expends his energy like in the Klitschko fight, but more economical with his energy. Kind of like Beterbiev who breaks down his opponent slowly over time, not pointlessly wasting energy, and let the knockout come (if it comes) rather than forcing it.
AJ would wipe the floor with wilder
The QEII turns faster than AJ, against any dynamic heavyweight, he's toast.
Aj is pathetic!
Why'd the ref wear white?😂
AJ height gave him an edge in the fight
Highlights? didn't see a single highlight in this "fight", boring
He should retire he’s nothing left to offer
Well I think AJ did well in this fight. The opponent was just not getting  KO'd that's all... And all fights must not be a KO.  Fury went whole rounds with so many unknown names that could be KO'd by Joshua.
he looks the part ,but being the part is different ,,
Lennox Lewis taught us all how to establish and control a fight with the jab. When a fighter is responding to a straight strike with a parry and counter you jab his eyes shut. AJ remembers this every other fight. This is why he struggles in fights he should dominate.
Something went wrong with Joshua because he hasn't been the same since after Andy Ruiz fight !
I didn't even know this clown had a fight till this day...
Boring match😅
AJ has had his day in my opinion.  Fearful of getting tagged now he’s been hurt a few times and tightens up. Doesn’t let his hands go and no aggression.  Not sure where he goes from here to be honest…
He needed this fight best thing for him! It’s back to them basics learning to switch it up. To me it’s like a page out of Errol’s book different things different styles different ways.
Wilder needs to get this fight immediately Joshua’s confidence is Ggoooone
Wilder by ko ..in 4.. over both of them 😂
It's so weird to see AJ fight so stiff
Bisschen ausm tritt aj gegen klammeraffen und zuviel Masse,aber    bleibt die 1
Fury soll antreten und die guertel abgeben,bis heute nicht ruiz oder aj geboxt nur show
Watching this, im not sure AJ could last a single round against fury
Never will be champ again so scared to fight but that's what ruiz did to him scared him forever 😅😅😅😅
Didn’t see anything to worry Wilder , AJ has no upper body movement and his head is a massive target for the over head rights Wilder loves to throw. He needed a better test than this to confirm his hunger is still there
AJ is back don't make me laugh
One thing is for sure Joshua does not want any part of Tyson Fury.
People saying Aj was hesitant yeah every shot he threw Franklin came back with 3 or more
I want to see him against Joe Joyce if he wants to prove he belongs with Fury.  Don't let this con man take your money unless you want to see Fury KO him so you can satisfy your inner evil.
AJ sux
I fell asleep watching AJ during the highlights. He throws so few punches and now moves like a boulder, he's no longer champ material.
He's awful 😂😂
For every hug -1 point and this Sport would be viewable
AJs shorts and refs shirt where white and now red
After watching this fight, I think AJ is definitely done now. I don't think there is anymore fire and fight in him. He looked sluggish. Just like watching Mike Tyson's last few fights. Even as dynamic as Mike's movement, you can just see he didn't really want to be there.
Im not that sure about AJ being back...
Aj is back. He should just stay away
Champ is back 💪🏻
Where's AJ before and now he must change the training or get retire.
His glorious days are gone..
Give aj even half the chance you would like in  life 2 losses . He is trying.  What nore do you want from human ffs
웃음기 쫙 뺀 거 안쓰럽네
I want to see Joshua v Wilder
Joshua not the greatest of boxers even pre-Ruiz and his lack of heart and will to win was shown in his 1st fight with Ruiz.  A boxer without heart or a will to win won't go far.  The likes of Calzaghe, Foreman, Carlos Monzon Hagler, Jake LaMotta, Tyson Fury, Ali, Roberto Duran, Holyfield, Eubank Snr, Holmes, Ray Mercer, GGG, Marciano, Julio Cesar Chavez, Lennox Lewis (to name but a few) all had that warrior mentality and heart, with many of them avenging defeats.  Unlike Joshua.    And it's something you can't coach or teach.  It's mental and you either have it or you don't.
I just love to see him win ❤️❤️
AJ doesn`t have that killer spirit in him. He`s done.
Joshua never the same after Ruiz.  And he wasn't that great before then.  And it's hard to take him seriously his post-fight interview in the 2nd Usyk fight.
AJ is finished!!! Obviously he's massively gun shy now, and frightened to engage and let his fists go!!! there's fighters out there who would beat him, 1.usyck 2. Wallin 3. fury. 4Joyce5. wilder! and maybe more?  AJ  Put it this way!!! you've achieved everything in boxing, made a lot of money!!!  stop treading water, either get back in with the above guys or call it a day!!! the performance against Franklin were so robotic!!! real boring fight,  Were like watching FRANK BRUNO!!
Sad to see AJ so bad.
Joshua is a spent force, he would have nothing to offer a fight or deserve one, with Usyk or Fury
Back? I didn't think he was there in the first place 😂
Let him best fury and wilder then we will know he is back
Saya ingin melihat Antoni Joshua lebih lincah,beringas seperti Mike Tyson 👍
Wilder puts him to sleep never mind fury
He’s too stiff seems gun shy
my mom it could go the 12 rounds she doesn't hit so hard anymore arthritis. I hope AJ will not embarrass himself next time he loses
AJ should adopt the high guard defense. Otherwise I see him going to sleep when he fights someone a little more credible
Back??? It was a weak performance, he is nowhere near being a threat to the top-ranked heavyweights at the moment.
terrible
fluent boxers joshua hasn't a cllue
disappointing
he isn't back
Why is AJ not letting his hands go, thought the fight was boring, AJ needs to be more aggressive..
He is not the AJ I know, this is Wilder's food.
I sincerely believe that AJ should needs a new trainer
vaya pelea
Tam bir teneke kas yigini ama icraat 0
What happened to Joshua?😢
Whole lotta hugging going on!
Congratulations to Anthony Joshua, well done!
Aj is so big and he’s so scared always expecting to hold
Aj is garbage he’s only making it because he’s a giant
Aj is a giant
Although he won AJ is now the shadow of himself. Clearly the losses drained his confidence. He didn’t let his hands go, too reticent for me.
They all tried
Joshua needs some footwork drills and combo drills I know he’s a plodder but if he wanna fight champions again he need some pep in his step
Joshua its over
Joshua doesn’t have a smiling face or angry face that’s a beast in disguise 😂❤
He’s like double the size of that guy, just similar weight cos Franklin’s fatter
Where can you find highlights that aren’t the equivalent of RT for Putins latest speech?
If these are the highlights, I don't want to see the boring parts. 😂
I would seriously consider boxing commentary for Joshua and do not put him in the ring with the elite ever
Wilder or Fury would literally end this man's career
"AJ IS DONE" would be the appropriate title.
I'm honestly embarrassed by how biased English commentators when our teams/athletes are competing
I was more impressed with Franklin
looking at the end.. he has lost the fire within....
looking at that... boxing is fixed! you could see joshua looking to his corner as if to say can I go know!
Aj certainly has the reach-height & physique to be a great boxer. He seems to lack speed & he seems lo lack combinations at the right time to finish an opponent off. He also seems lacking when up close to score with uppercuts rather than just hanging on for a rest. Ideally he should be asking Lennox lewis for advice as far as coaching & strategy goes as Lewis was one of the best, if not the best of a generation.
Joshua can't even KO Mr nobody..
"Joshua is back" going full rounds against some nobody. He's done, finished. As soon as he steps in with any top contender, he's career is done.
AJ looked too heavy .
He should start fighting youtubers, he's got nothing for real boxers.
hahahaha he is back?? no way, he fcin sux now, he should retire. ruiz and usyk took his soul.
Huinja
So many times josh could have added more combinations and finished off franklin but is too scared to get starched
AJ vs fury should of happened years ago. The only person Joshua should be fighting to prove he is still one of the best is Fury. I dont think i've ever seen Joshua in a 50/50 fight
Sleep 😪
No bounce in Joshua's feet little head movement no wonder it was so easy for usyk if your flat footed like that means you need to be throwing power punshes than jabs
Молодец Джошуа
Dillian will beat AJ if he fights this way.AJ is finished
You can already see that Anthony is not feeling well in Ring!  When we watched Anthony Dereck Vs Chisora ​​or Anthony Joshua vs Dillian Whyte, he had a great time. He was dynamic, he hit back from counters and had no inhibitions in the ring. He was a real fighter. We loved watching his matches!  I don't think you can find yourself for a long time!  Sorry Anthony 🙏
Aj didn't look like he wanted to be in that ring at all. I believe his hunger for the sport is gone. A 🐌 moves better than Aj did in this fight. Boring fight to me!
At some point I genuinely thought i was watching a slow motion replay and then i realised that i wasnt and its just how slow they move 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Anthony "the statue" Joshua
.And these ladies and gentlemen, are the HIGHLIGHTS, the 'best action' ...can you beleive it? Dull.
the fight so boring, josua did not do anythings....why josua fight withouth art, dance, just waiting and do cover his face...no struggling....
AJ is finished as a top 5 fighter. Sad to see as he’s a great guy
Joshua vs Wilder next.
Can he fight someone his size. im sure the next fight will be a fat old man lol
Spam
Boring watching AJ now!!
If AJ fight D Wilder or T Fury like this he will be the one to get hurt badly
Thoroughly unentertaining!
a want my money back aj.
Given that Fury has ducked him three times already and now shown the world that he is just sitting on the WBC belt for as long as possible without fighting, AJ will have to fight Joyce, Dubois or Wilder. Not Whyte, he’s had his chance…let’s face it, he even got a chance against the the ducker himself Tyson Feary. This Franklin guy is no mug though, quick hands like Ruiz but more athletic and aggressive. People like Wilder and Fury will not fight him.
Joshua is finished 😅
You have to respect AJs achievements in the ring, but he is human and his defeats look like they’ve taking there toll on him and his fighting style. It’s pretty clear fury would play with him in there.
That was a tough watch. Was it PPV?
AJ  is  back  is  he  ?  Did  you  write  that  Eddie  ?    You've  convinced  me.......hahahahaha .   In all reality,  we  may  have  expected  too much  too  soon. In saying  that, he's  had a  few  comebacks  now.  I'm  just  not  seeing  the  fruit.
1.13  - like watch an old lady with her PT at Fitness First
this guy was supposed to be the future, Ruiz took all his swag.
Aj shxt from beginning of his spoon fed career until now boring
This is not Joshua that beat Klitschko, he had lost form. Where were his ruggedness, those hard punches and strong upper cuts, his movement is dull, he should free himself from psychological set back, he should be business like to earn his fame and fans back, he should stop fighting like a "fashion model" he should go to study the fights of Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis, Larry Holmes bcos, he is going to face harder boxers to reclaim his former tittles back, pls I love you, you are still young to make more fame, thanks
Tyson fury will ate them both...
My take on aj vs franklin Aj is a far better boxer than dillion white.franklin beatup white that fight could go any way an it would be ok .aj did not allow franklin to beat up on him like he did on white
Is derrick James his trainer?
Hope AJs mum uses DAZ
The ref was cheating for Joshua
I see change now in Joshua but he needs to move abit faster he’s too slow
Fury would knock his block off
Aj career is finished he just doesn’t know it yet.
So AJ is done being a top contender
Two dossers! 😂 Fury needs to retire AJ
AJ almost murdered Franklin with his right hand.😊
not convinced.dont think Joshua would stand a chance against fury or wilder.
If AJ can not rediscover his old speed and bravery he will not be champion ever again he is too scared to go for it
AJ is a lazy champion. Can't bet on him
all of them HARD fights and he struggles with this one? he's either tired with boxing or just plain lucky to make it this far.  He should just give up the gloves and enjoy his life and move on.. Be a family man you have proved yourself in the past you have nothing left to offer. be the better man
Mad jabs
is he back??
Football of now better Dan 80s, but boxers in the 80s better than now. Present boxer don't have strong presence, they are either scared or slow.
stiff and gun shy.the old joshua would have sparked franklin in 2 or less.
Joshua has put on looks like a lil more weight; don’t look as cut-up like he usually does.
AJ can't take a punch... That is his biggest problem.
Joshua shouldnt text to and talk with pak, UK based boxer Amir khan wife.
I see a new Joshua.... Lethal and composed.
selten habe ich so eine scheisse geshen...joshua.......3-klassig ......usyk würde ihn wieder windel weich prügeln......
It's different when you become a professional, because you also have to become a businessman, and that takes something away from it."
What a boring match!
Since he stopped takam in 2017 He’s only had 2 knockout victories in 6 years Povetkin and Pulev both guys in their 40’s and well past their prime  2 knockouts 6 years
Was Aj always this bad? Did the hype and adoration really cloud our judgments? I feel like I'm stuck in the twilight zone, watching AJ fight.
Jermaine Franklin showed some real competition for the next guy. That's putting the sport on notice imo he ate plenty of shots and appeared to baffle he's opponent with his power. I think they fought well and entertained the event.
W
This AJ will be disgraced by either Wilder or Fury. He's too heavy, slow and not aggressive. He doesn't have the hunger anymore.
What has happened to AJ lately he's lost it
AJ......IS......DONE.
To be fair I think that Franklin is better than is Chisora today.
Not impressed at all. I think someone like fury will destroy him. Joshua is so one dimensional
Congratulations AJ, please improve on the foot work and speed. Improve your defenses and need more of Combo moves
Joshua is finished…..I have seen more life in a bowl of egusi😂
for me this was a very intelligent performance from AJ. It is a fight which you can use to show an upcoming boxer some of the basics of boxing.
Yep Tyson Fury will steam roll A.J. he's fighting to cautiously here.
Joshua isn't gonna last long, he is way too flat footed, slow, scared to commit and gets hit too much. I give him maybe 2 fights more then he's done!! Maybe he should fight Fury once and for all for one last big oay day!
Marshmallow hands a welterweight would take him apart
Garbage
bu adam boksu bıraksın vucutcu olsun
hala eskiv eksikliği ve hala korkakca dçvüşüyor
Aj is now not a contender. The once exciting prospect of Joshua-Fury. Just no way it could ever happen. He's got no confidence.
I know these are only selected highlights, but he totally dominated. I think the critics are being a little harsh. Needs to de-bulk though to be more mobile and negate a little power. Too heavy AJ.
This gotta be the worst commertator ever. You can tell he want aj to win
And these were the HIGHLIGHTS?
extremely bland......probably the most boring fight of the decade
AJ is back 🤣 Brilliant..
Hopes he fight Kingkong Ortiz
Joshua still needs to improve on his quick reaction to punches, Abit slow which makes aggressive opponents ruin him severally. I love AJ
Joshua's high guard,parry & pin is a decent improvement in a short space of time.Great choice of coach.
Now it's time to retire for AJ
I saw it different than most. From a technical perspective AJ is much improved.
That ref is 🗑️, all the rabbit punches and the 11th round hook as they broke near the end of the round. Made this ref look like a pure amateur.
When you don't have confidence in the results of your own work, you look like Anthony Joshua
Im not a fan of joshua but i actually like how he didnt try to power his way through the fight instead he was going for accuracy making his Jab work for him instead of going into slugfest mode nice show of control Aj
AJ becoming more like Mayweather boring
I'm getting a massive headache just watching Franklin soak up all those jabs to the face.
Bro Joshua didn’t win any of these rounds they literally just let Joshua win. J
Round 7 was joshua best round
How much did you pay jermainec
Joshua looked stiff asfk sometimes i feel stiff like that after i been in sum yams🤣
It's like watching a frightened adult fighting a brave kid. Heart definitely triumph size.
I'm truly clueless as to how AJ got as far as he did. He looks like he's AFRAID to let his hands go! He's just there.
Bout time he won
He’s not back he’s just an again
AJ is too stiff to be a boxer. Go for the knockout people will begin to fear you again. Now you are a water carrier.
AJ is big and average at best.  He’s just not a skillful boxer.  I fall asleep watching him box.  Jesus
Yh Joshua’s done
Joshua just can't seem to let his hands go anymore, which is usually the sign of a shot fighter
Joshua looks scared at all times, Ruiz really messed him up, he’ll always be like this until he retires, trainer James can’t change that. Joshua should be a force in the heavy weight division but he’s turned out to be a fluke, Fury would have a ball with him, Wilder would beat him also, maybe he should be a model or something he’s to soft
if AJ fights Wilder or Fury the way he fought this fight he is going to get knocked out!!!🥊🥊
That version aj doesn't beat fury or Wilder at all
nonsense..
Aj better watch and study Errol Spence.
People expect AJ to just steamroll Franklin and get himself possibly knocked out.  Franklin can fight.  And some people feel he beat Dillian Whyte.   Therefore AJ done well.  He doesn't have to knock out everyone he fights just to prove to casual fight fans.
I don't know and don't understand why AJ wants to gain muscle when he's the best at 230-240 I don't get it
This fight was so exciting I never watched it!
Everlast gloves? hmmm looks like someone lost sponsorship
If this is Deodny Wielder , he could knock Franklin Down in 7th or 8th round with just one right hand
The confidence, fierceness, intimidating persona, ring dominance that AJ had before his first loss, I'd say he's never recovered from that Ruiz loss. Looking at him now moving like the bricks used to build the Egyptian pyramids. The heavyweight division is just sad to look at, no wonder Tyson Fury doesn't seem interested anymore. No adrenaline at all, nothing to be excited about, probably Fury doesn't see anything worth getting into the ring for. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
AJ has been finished since Ruiz facts !!!!!
Slow starting
AJ has Became Gun Shy ...wish he could find his greatness again ...he 1 of the greatest come ups ever
Joshua's punch is big. Franklin's heart is big
The world boxing today is not as competitive back in the 90's.... 😮😮
"This ain't it bruh"-in Charlemagne's voice😂
If these are the highlights thank Moses I didn't watch the whole fight
AJ's time is up
I so much love AJ man. Fighters react to defeat in different ways  Some are emotionally enclaved  and it  takes Herculean therapy to make them  crawl out of the shell that back to back defeat has enslaved them  AJ  Go champ  Omo- naija
lacklustre performance from an also ran
It was a less than convincing performance, I won't waste time here detailing the obvious shortcomings AJ displayed. I kept imagining Franklin fighting Fury and how he would have handled a shorter opponent like him. Until AJ can get back some aggression and the confidence to let his hands go to keep opponents off him, he will keep losing with any top tier fighter.
Definitely watching the fight, I think was boxing more like an amateur, not like real professional boxer, what we had in the past, like all the great names. Boxing is not what was before, now is all about the money. And not for the fans😢
aj lost something.he lost character and thats losing everything.but he is getting money
Best AJ ever.
AJ 👍🇬🇧🇺🇦
Time to call it day, AJ.  You've made your money, and you're clearly no longer interested in the game.  Just make the announcement and go to work for the BBC.
Yarbrough 😁
Hearn will say wilder or fury or joyce but he ll fight gillian again.
Wilder knocks him out Fury will school him easily  he looks scared to take a punch nowadays.
Wallin or Joyce
He's not mate.
Tut mir leid A.J Du bist ein Lutscher.. schon gegen Ruiz der Dir schön ein eingeschenkt hat hast Du Dich wie ein Asi verhalten.. Am besten nochmal Trainer wechseln.. weil an denen liegt es ja..🤣🤣.. und dann mal so langsam ans Golfen denken.. Boxen ist was für Männer mit Kämpferherz.. Du bist nur ein Amateur..!!
Why is he going backwards? Thought Boxers liked a tougher opponent and challenge from the last fight each time. To think a year or so ago I actually had hopes for Joshua Vs Fury. Oh well, shows what I know.
That’s how it looks when a boxer leaves his Prime. Joshua is over the hill. He won’t get any younger or any better anymore. He wasn’t bad in his young years.
:)))  maybe he has the courage to fight wilder next
Joshua is very very bad
AJ wouldnt last 30 seconds with  iron mike tyson at his best
It's pretty boring listening when commentators are only talking about aj
AJ won this fight purely on longer reach and nothing else. If Franklin matched him in height and reach AJ would have yet another loss on his record.
AJ is finished
AJ, Whyte, Dubois are all non-contenders. Joyce, Fury and Wilder are the top 3. Usyk will take out Dubois within 6 rounds. Fury will duck him again and Usyk will outpoint Joyce but not put a single dent in him. The most interesting fight to make is Usyk vs Wilder.
Needs to get out of his head
feed this guy to wilder
Yeah AJ is back no change just not going enough
Joshuar, du musst lang Boxen, du bist der größere! Lass dich von Lennox Lewis trainieren, dann wirst du wieder Champion!!!!
Aj doesn't look confident stiff as a brick no head movement
That Franklin looks like a tiny little guy. Frank Bruno would beat Joshua
Gratulacje Joshua - dobrze że wróciłeś .💪👊👍
Joshua should be in a nursing home he boxer's like a old age pensioner 😅
Joshua was so more exciting and lethal when he went in ready to finish opponents from the first bell
Boring…… This flop needs to stop running and fight Fury, usyk or wilder
Garbage fight switched it off before the last 2 rounds. AJ is washed up, he could barely throw combinations, poor footwork, lateral movement and looked uninspired he needs to retire soon.
Who’s the guy in the red shorts?
Joshua is very stiff in his movements and on feet but he has tremendous punching power
Watching AJ after his loses feels like watching a young prospect who’s too scared to gamble on whether to protect his 0 or go all guns blazing… I feel he’s lost that fire in the belly he had. His confidence has been torn away from him completely.
Aj is back where pushing walking frame
I think if Joshua had fought this guy before all the losses, he would have made a sausage out of him. Wrong mentality.
If Frankenstein's monster could "Box"
Is it me or does aj keep holding him up
AJ is finished.  He should take up gardening or dog walking. He is still pining for a last big spanking with Tyson after years of hiding from him. Goodbye AJ
Joshua trash
if AJ is reading these comments  i’m guessing he knows what he has to do i really wanna see AJ on top of the world again   ‘brother, i think you know what you have to do’
Jared Anderson kills joshua
I'm sorry but AJ would get taken apart by Wilder or Fury. He's not aggressive enough, he doesn't throw combinations and seems to be happy just jabbing and keeping his distance.
On that performance he should be calling out Tommy fury not tyson fury 😂😂
"AJ is back" next time out he, ll be on his back, the guys finished now, another washed out fighter trying for last go at glory
Falling continues.....😂🎉😅
scare fight AJ
Hard fan of AJ but in this fight  his body movement look like he walk on moon!!!
with that performance he didn’t look like he would be able to hold Tyson’s bag let alone share the ring…
cant stand this pleb AJ
Aj just scared of getting hit like ruiz
Didn't know you could hold the back of the head down... Different rules in the UK?
retire
Yeah I take it back Wilder would demolish Joshua
A lot of people in these comments don’t know nothing about boxing, Joshua was doing things he’s never done before in this fight and seemed more focused and composed than I’ve ever seen him Derrick James made a difference!
Gib
Back to what, dude looked like top 200 in his weightclass
Looked like a frendly match
Bore
We don’t really know what AJ and Derrick James plan behind closed doors but it is evident that there is an objective. AJ is not in the process of climbing the ladder, he is also not in the position of defending any world title. He is in the process of rebuilding. Indeed he is not the same fighter. He’s learning and working on new tricks of the trade along with his new trainer as evident in his jab, fight control, patience, punch variations and overall defence. He showed that the right hand is still there. It is unclear  whether it was his/their decision to not follow up aggressively after that right hand but it’s a little unfair for us to put pressure on AJ to win via K.O in his first fight after those losses. I think that they will probably continue to work on what they’ve been working on and progress to add more tricks to his arsenal with his trainer. When all those weapons start to come together and he can recall them at will, that’s when he will be ready to challenge for a title. Unfortunately for him, age is not on his side but let’s see how the HW division progresses.
Getting boring about joshua style
Aj can't draw with this pace of his with tyson fury
AJ needs to work more on his footwork
If these were the "highlights" I'm glad I didn't get suckered in to paying for a DANZ subscription.
He's afraid of jushua
Look  at the size difference..but AJ seem to be having a hard time.. retirement is waving
Visions of Audley Harrison when watching AJ, such a shame to see him so gun shy.
Where's my whopper?
This is a misleading video title. With this performance AJ is NOT Back! This no heavy weight fight
They just gift this kid another win huh.
Ever since Anthony Joshua visited buhari Nigeria 🇳🇬 president Is career as never known excellent 😅
AJ still got it bro! We want to see Fury vs AJ still. AJ was unlucky in the other fights with shocking ref decisions probably due to his race because we live in the western world. But AJ showed here he is still top of the world. I reckon he’d beat fury and he’d ko Usyk that Ukrainian guy if they fought one more time. He didn’t get time to find his feet before
Give AJ a break...or won!!! and he won well...he needed12 rounds...remember he has not had easy fights for a while..he is re building...learning to fight and not box...
Joshua is still my man. Though he has his flaws but he is still my man
AJ is back 😂 he's gone down hill since Andy Ruiz beat him not the same fighter as he used to be and overall I thought the Franklin fight was terrible if AJ was really back I was expecting a knockout and the fight to last 6 rounds but from like round 7 I just saw aj trying to slow the fight and rounds by holding Franklin to tire him out
Joshua is the big man, it should have been knockout from Joshua end but he is not a raw fighter.
Franklin got a solid chin on him
Himself
He is so sluggish,I thought he wud want to send a message to those who gave him a gud beatin
AJ still looks as if he has no confidence, his jabs have no snap, he doesn't pull the trigger on his right, and he still fights straight up and flat-footed. His punches lack what some call "evil intent". He is lucky that Franklin wasn't a stronger and more aggressive inside boxer, seems he's forgotten his "Kronk" education from Manny Stewart.
He bck earning money, this was a meaningless fight towards the end of his boxing carear. Let him fight Wilder or other top 5 if he wants to be credable again
Что бы вернутся в королевский бокс , Джошуа должен был нокаутировать , уничтожить Франклина !
KING AJ 👑🥊
If that AJ being ‘back’ I hope he goes away again
I hate how he hesitated after he landed that uppercut in the 6th round.
All of a sudden Usyk's wins don't seem so impressive🤣🤣
yawnville
😂
Should have stayed with Rob mcCracken
Wow impressive come back 🤣
Либо Джошуа пора на пенсию, либо он ростянул специально этот бой, потому что столько пришло людей не за накаутом в первых раундах, было видно как он включился в 11,12 раунде
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 back ? He’s slow , afraid to be hit and has NO punching power
AJ absolutely terrified to take a hit and you can see it in how he boxes it’s not confident
He was right. I don't wanna lose is its mental state. Physically he's in his prime right now
Thanks
I'd like to see Franklin vs Parker
JOSHUA VERY VERY SLOW HE DONT HAVE CHANCE TO WIN THE TITLE  IF IS NOT GOIN TO FIX THAT
IVE BEEN SAYING ALONG ANTHONY DONT HAVE THE RIGHT  TRAINER..FOR HIS SIZE HE NEEDS  GEORGE FORMAN..JOSHUA FIGHTING LIKE HE LIGHT WEIGHT OR ETC.. JUST LIKE WILDER  HE  TRYING TO FIGHT LIKE HE IS  G. FORMAN.. BUT HIS STYLE SHOULD BE LIKE FLOYD ETC...HE IS NOT BIG IF FLOYD TRAINED WILDER HE WOULD BE A DIFFERENT FIGHTER..
When Joshua is a real boxer, he can't fight with Franklin to 12 rounds.
AJ needs to get up on his toes more and stick that jab the instant his opponent sets his feet to exchange.
He had a fight ??
Joshua dice que su carrera a florecido jajajajajaja mire ya Joshua no le gana a un clase A más nunca en su vida y con ese boxeo lo que va a buscar es que lo retiren en malas condiciones si Franklyn lo llevo hasta el 12 y no lo nockeo imagínense a Joshua vs Wilder o vs Tyson Fury bendito hay que d circle RIP jajajaja
Der letzte Boxer war Tyson, wo man es genießen konnte und das man voll dabei war durch Aufregung...aber danach alles möchte gern und fake kämpfe, show kämpfe nur...Klitschkos brüder oder joshua haben mir nie das aufgeregte Gefühl gegeben wo ich fan sein könnte..naja boxen ist out
BOOOOOOOORIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNGGGGG
Antony needs to stop chilling with the mandem he’s stiff af, wilder would seriously run through him rn smh
Can’t believe how standard Aj is looking, wasn’t interesting to watch at all 😮
i think those who said Joshua was disappointing are simply looking for KO. But Franklin gave a hard fight and wouldn't go donw when hurt. Yes Usyk fights very differently and Joshua propably would have lost a third time if it was Usyk yest again but i dont see any rounds that Franklin won
Boring fight
Joshua not the same since that infamous Ruiz fight imo..... very tentative these days.........fights like a man who's lost all confidence in his abilities !
boring!!!
Joshua is boring , the ref allowed him to hold all the time and Franklin was to small to escape. A bigger man would have not let him get away with it.
He still needs another tune up fight really if he is going to seriously compete with a Fury, Wilder or Joyce..He is no longer the AJ we all used to know sadly
Was this video filmed in slow motion?
NO MARK V. HAS BEEN
Joshua is trash.
Seriously..what's the end game here..he could have fought wilder, could have fought fury..a trilogy with Andy would have made more sense then fighting this non contender
он как-то не доволен победой. Хотел больше
Always the student never the master.  Carefully chosen opponents and avoiding the big draw. Not much of a legacy
aj never was that guy lol
💩 fight
Allah is Great Muslim  to the top Aj
Joshua dövüş tekniğini değiştirmiş.Tam adapte olmasa da iyi.Savunması daha iyi olmuş.Fakat geç kaldı.
I think AJ should loose some weight. Hes getting older now which dont help he just seems slow.
Not seeing anyone talk about how better AJ got defensively
Luiz broke AJ,, don't know what needs to be done but this boy needs a hard reset....AJ has the greatest physic, agility and skill to be one of, if not the greatest heavyweight boxer ever but not so more broken like this....
joshua hasnt evolved as a fighter in 5 years.....overhyped to the max..
AJ please retire bro. You ain't ever winning a world title again. Unless Eddie buys you one.
Já cá estou
I will like him to Fight Joseph Parker.That will be a step up from Franklin but not too much to overwhelm him like Fury or wilder or even Whyte. It will allow him to build on the present low confidence and since Parker is not a pressure fighter and also not slow like Franklin, it will allow him to also check his stamina as well.
Someone said they are still in a clinch in the changing room, been there past few days cuddling.
Millions in the Bank and losses have diminished the fire in those legs. AJ was bad but looks much worse now.
Two poor fighters, AJ would get ruined by Fury. Ik he’s been dropped a few times but has he forgotten how to throw a combo? so stiff.
Fury will end AJ within 3 rounds.
Super boring fight: AJ needs to hang it up, too old I guess? He doesn’t have speed and style. He needs to watch some Ali fights when Ali was young.
Mandonga anaweza angusha joshua
Credit to the commentator. He truly is a creator of commentary, you would think he was commenting another fight
AJ needs less muscle and 100% needs to get hit more he can’t take the punishment
Anthony Joshua is traumatised from them losses, he's petrified to mix it u0
That was the highlights, heck. Glad i didnt watch the fight. AJ is done - too robotic, slow and would get destroyed by wilder and fury.
AJ needs to come in at 17 and a half to achieve optimum performance.   He should beat up Dillian Whyte next and then on to Fury or Wilder
Why all the hype, 12 round of boxing. That’s it.
Josua must lose weight. He tirad very easy when he is heavier.
Joshua reminds me a lot of Wladimir Klitschko in the 2nd half of his career, when he had that safety first style with Manny Steward... the very boring jab jab grab. jab jab right hand.... Is he trying to emulate W. Klitschko?
Bad bad performance from Joshua. He is just standing still with his hands high getting punched.
Aj did not fight like he used to before something is wrong 😂😂
AJ is really not an elite fighter anymore and it actually hurts
AJs lookin brilliant......I wanna see him fight Philip Schofield next.
How can AJ be back  if he could not even put this guy away.  AJ likes to hold and hit by the way.
AJ nie ma szans na bycie ponownie mistrzem swiata . Fury i Wilder zbili by go strasznie
A.j top G
AJ still ain't ready for usyk. Definitely not Fury.
Stiff
The only thing missing from Joshua is the aggression the killer instinct but the accuracy is on point just needs to follow it up
Fury would make him look bad
AJ absolutely gutted he couldn't get him out of there.
AJ is his pathetic self, no determination, no snap in the jab, no follow the jab, no jab twice, no head movement. those are the things he needs to work on. You would think by now he would have learned this. He doesn't KNOW what he wants, and it shows... his trainer isn't any goo, he doesn't listen, or he doesn't do what he was taught. Whatever, it ain't workin...
AJ needs Iron Mike Tyson in his corner. Mike will bring back the menacing, ruthless AJ, who brought the pain!
As tall as AJ still grabbing this small man Shame to you AJ AJ is not professional at all
AJ is not the same as he used to be. Not a top contender anymore.
Un sport de dingue 😢
Tbf. Aj did not gas.. Franklyn was game.. But i think it is fair to say.. Ajs problems are psychological..you could see it in him on his ringwalk with ruiz.. I hope he falls back in love with the sport.. Hes got loads mkre to offer.. But fighting once a ywar is hopeless to any fighter at top level
Jushua is always hugging, this fight is boring,he can't beat Alexander usyk even in 5 times rematch.
British media has tendency of hyping their own AJ is overrated he doesnt have that beast mode in like Dante or Klitscho lol  in that ring you need to be operating in different modes to win
Tyson will finish AJ inside 6
didn't even know this fight was on lol nice promotion
back fighing bums wow go aj
He don’t trust his chin n it suks
Joshua almost had a swag moment. He got extremely confident for about 10 seconds, then he almost got hit. And went right back to being afraid to commit to a punch. I have never seen a man so strong, but is too busy trying to get out the way, instead of committing to a punch
Don’t know if y’all commenting knows this but Anthony is never an aggressive fighter. Which I wish he was  I’ll just say he’s been very careful during this fight which is kinda his style
Slow and ponderous still.
AJ needs to delete all his social media accounts, drop all his sponsors and go train in the Himilayas for six months. He hasn't been same since wladimir klitschko
who is joshua?
Please make the clown disappear. Don’t try to start the hype again, he can’t box.

So the English can now hold behind the head and land multiple punches?  How long has this been allowed?
AJ is not back. This fight just proved his fighting days are over at the top level. He has little footwork and is slow and robotic.
AJ is not ready for a title shot, I think it's going to be a loss for him if he goes close to the top three...
At this point I can’t even pay a dollar for AJ’s fights. This man is like Deontay Wilder. No boxing skills,just counting on his lucky one punch. I can now see why Fury called him a useless bodybuilder. It shows in his last 2 fights.
Franklin got a dog in him
I'm a big AJ fan, and overall performance was decent but a bit lacklustre.  You can tell AJ was trying to implement what he has been taught and not searching for the knockout. He seemed to be treating it like a sparring match. Looking at his corner during rounds was concerning to see. Like he shouldn't need to do that.  I think he needs to drop a half a stone atleast aswell was alot more rigid than his previous four fights.
low intensity fight, Aj getting old
Самый скучный бой какой я видел
Franklin needed a Tighter defense  He did really well He should have stayed And put his combinations together More on the inside he did really well too
Anthony Did really well Franklin made it easy for him by staying more on the outside
Joshua grabbed the back of Franklin head the entire fight. What a coward
Lackluster would be a word some would use
Slowly tapering off steroids is really starting to show.
Boring. As. F.
When???year?
He looked a bit sluggish ../
Aj literally looks like he doesn’t wanna be there. Not scared just looks disinterested
I feel Usyk has Joshua being smarter more calculated and technical he’s not as sloppy as he use to be . Gonna give him longevity
I have something in common with AJ, I don't being punched in the face either.
Hes back and nothing more....hahaha...😂😂😂😂..he can not be a champ again....much better for him to join a weightlifting contest....
AJ needs to work in his foot work and timing. Also head movement
Fury eats his lunch. No way he gets a W fighting Tyson like this. He isn't busy enough too slow and can't answer the punch rate, Fury will give him that work with OT.
He definitely a different fighter but I think working with Derrick James is gonna make him a smarter fighter you can see it already he didn’t leave his chin open as much as he has done in the past just to look for big shots once he start learning to work the body AJ gonna be back in the mix just need more time with Derrick and watching errol and Charlo and he gonna more comfortable in the ring
These guys have big fights to make. Over it.
AJ needs to work with a decent sports psychologist to help him build his mental strength back up. Physically he's fine. Ruiz put doubt in his mind and someone needs to help him remove it! Is Paul McKenna still around? He did wonders for Nigel Benn when he faced Gerald McClellan.... ;-)
AJ footwork 🤧
Boxeador triste ese Joshua, no arriesga nada no da espectáculo ☹️
AJ is not included in my top 100 heavyweights of all time
His only aiming for the head and face,he has to concentrate on body and parts to make the opponent feel week before a head knock
Aj still look traumatised and weak i can't believe Aj fought like a weak man ,thanks to Franklin he really stressed him big time.😅
He needs to go to Garcia as a trainer. I don't like the direction his boxing was going. His defense was tight, but he wasn't letting his hands go. In his last fight he was trying to land body shots and mix up his punch selection. This was a regression
Poor fight
Like him once but now he is so poor
Yawnnnnnnn
Estamos em um nova era do boxe, AJ já não tem mais nada pra mostrar, ele não vai conseguir, psicologicamente, disputar um cinturão novamente.
They love you when your opponent is black
Wen the oldboy fight again haha
Should give up boxing..Couldn't box eggs
This fight didn’t have highlights so this is clickbait
AJ still a flop to me. This fight should not have gone 12 rounds.
If AJ fights like this against Tyson Fury,  he stands absolutely no chance.  I'll give AJ two, maybe three rounds max. Definitely not the same fighter be was.  He used to be exciting to watch but that was like watching grass grow.
Credit to Franklin, that uppercut at 9:07 put Klitschko down.
way too many ads
bof
How does he get worse every fight it’s actually crazy
AJ is just too scared of his glass jaw
REF WAS GARBAGE!!! AJ was holding Franklin like a kid with a new teddy bear
For A. J. to successfully engage Usky in the nearest future, he must be faster on his style and learn how to quickly retrieve after any attack on his opponent.
What's with the red dye in AJs shorts?? It was bleeding more than Franklin
Way to keep fighting Franklin
i can still see the sparks of the boxer he once was, and perhaps could be again, but i think we are still in the place of wondering does AJ even want this anymore? I dont see the passion and love for boxing in him now. So, its almost like... its fine to just go home and enjoy the fruits of his labour. But you cant be a hesitant and unsure heavy weight boxer. It doesnt exist.
Anthony Joshua is a bodybuilder.. he moves like a robot.. if he was in the era of Mike Tyson, Lennox Lewis, Reddick bow....etc he wouldn't even be in the boxing scene
Easily one of the worst heavyweight fights I have ever watched. Slow, dull and boring.
I like ruiz vs wilder and fury vs usky. Joshua was overrated,  but he is just a comedian.
Fury would knock them both out at the same time
Dreadful and static by Joshua,......that was reasonably embarrassing, no disrespect to the American boxer,..at least he showed some passion 👍🇬🇧
the fight is boring
AJ now too slow scare,after the fight  with Ulk Sich change 180’he will retire soon
AJ just a clown
Tbh joshua is trash
Very wooden ?
The worst commentary I’ve ever listened to. Complete biased observations. Called less than halve of Franklins punches
So na this kind fight give am mind to call out furry.
So overrated
Right hook had him buzzed in RD 12! He needed to throw it more often!!
AJ was average at best for X champion
Boring fight
So slow . Moves and punches like a robot on low batteries.
AJ fights like a counter puncher with the build of a brawler. Without the aggression (and the gas tank) he’s never getting back to the top
Aj has definitely lost his confidence. Don't have it anymore
AJ fights with emotion. It’s better to retire if you don’t really want to punch your opponent
Wheres the hug fest???
Ruiz changed him he’s gun shy 🙈
Same style.
aj will never be world class again

AJ, YOU HAVE EVERYTHING TO BECOME A CHAMPION EXCEPT A HEART.  IF YOU HAVE MIKE TYSON'S HEART, YOU ARE UNBEATABLE!!  GO TO THE US AND GET A REAL TRAINER AND STOP MESSING AROUND.
Go to the dictionary and check next to scared and what picture do you think you will see. Ruiz ruined this guy
These are the highlights?! It never got any better than this?! Glad I didn't pay for it.
can anybody explain to me why AJs shorts and the refs shirt turn more and more red over the match? Is it blood?
Hey Ref, MQR is clear, you cannot hold a man behind the head with one hand and punch him with the other...unless your Ali...
Joshua 👎👎👎
Fear changes men
❤
He got that ej and Charlo stands AJ back derrick James got him right
Joshua es malísimo. Cómo pudieron compararlo con Ali en algún momento. Que flojo es el nivel de los pesados en la actualidad.
Пиздец🤦
Who do I want to see him fight next? maybe a Trans...
I like the smart play and the technic from AJ, we are sitting in our living room and we want to see blood, it is entertaining. But remembers guyz the point on boxing is to hit and don't hit.
Both Wouldnt last 30 sec against tyson
Aj could never last 12 rounds with the gypsy king
AJ v Wilder
Anyone know Franklins ring walk song? 🔥
He don’t got it no more. Aj. But that’s alright. Not like he grew up boxing. He just jumped in late, for the money. Due to natural physique, he had some success.
🐆 miaaaw
AJ not agressive enough imo
Fury still would ko AJ in 3 rounds imo
Huge respect to Franklin
AJ would get sparked by Wilder or Fury easily. Dudes fire is gone completely.
Nothings at bloody stake, he is a wash out, no title fights for him.
This craft exhibited by Anthony Joshua can't win HIS titles back. He is too sloppy for heavy weight.
Coming soon: AJ v Fury, the fight everybody wanted...but now nobody wants...except Hearn and Warren..
9:27 how'd the ref not see that when it's literally right in front of you. he's holding down the back of his head while punching. imo AJ isn't the same as he use to be. he use to have so much drive
Big unit like aj shouldn’t be answered back for 12 rounds off smaller heavy weight, he’s going to struggle now with bigger opponents , I thought those highlights was massive in his favour as watched it live and thought looked closer than showed, a wins a win but not convinced, I think he needed to put him away earliest for this so called come back mission .
Forget Joshua.
Am watching... Anthony is too slow now
AJ is truly back
No disrespect to Franklin, but if Joshua has to rely on the judges to beat him, I wouldnt bet against even Whyte beating him, let alone Wilder or Fury.
Not impressed poor fight
Joshua does not feel it anymore. It's just a job, for him
I hope we get to see : Francis Ngannou vs Anthony Joshua Tyson Fury vs Francis Ngannou Francis Ngannou vs Deontay Wilder
Hes never been the same since he told everyone to stop shopping in white owed business
With this night performance Joshua cannot beat usyk at all. I expected him to knockout this guy on the 7th round latest. AJ seriously needs to be violent in attack. Not even a single knock down to his opponent in a whole 12 round. Mennn... The drawing board still have more lessons for you unless age is naturally giving way. Ur my most Loved boxer and I don't want to see you win by unanimous decision, KO is what Ur known for. That's Ur BREED
Not impressed at all.Joe Joyce,Fury,Wilder would stomp AJ in the ground.....
Joshua's way down the pecking order now. Wilder, Joyce, and Fury would destroy him. He's just another journeyman now. Move on son your finished...
Has he been watching Frank Bruno video's,,hes Finnished
AJ has spent to many lazy days in Dubai, its all got to him. No hunger
Joshua is fighting like Wilder.
His fights are now boring fights, real fight always starts at over 5, 6 rounds lol. Never do combos, always jabs jabs jabs, he is anthony jaber now lol
when did this fight happen remember the days when AJ was the men in  boxing hopefully he comes back on the top where he belongs take him over fury any day
3.6 million views, are you mad? AJ’s crazy.
My man is back ,great win that jab top shelf aproch.let they bark line them up ...let's go champ
"AJ IS BACK" ... The only fight left for AJ is Wilder.
Is he Joshua??real AJ??
Antek za ciężki
AJ don’t have it anymore.
AJ  is lame😂😂😂
Hmm Joshua doesn't like being hit . Not suprised he's dodging Joe Joyce.  He'd lose by a mile and get knocked out . He should be fighting detony wilder but he won't cos he'd get knocked out with him aswell . Over rated
Franklin should have done a Mike Tyson style of boxing.  Josh wouldn't be standing.
Chicken 🐔 Aj is scared to fight Wilder. Coward
UNPOPULAR OPINION: Derek James is teaching AJ to conserve energy by stepping as opposed to using his athleticism to move in & out. I’m interested to see how they progress moving forward
Such a boring fight. AJ is a different man now. That Ruiz fight completely changed him and he doesn’t stand a chance against the current top heavyweight fighters
Joshua too slow for Tyson F.
Anthony didn't look very exciting! He looked old sluggish his feet was in sand AJs style was boring and that is so so sad! The Bronze Bomber will hurt AJ if he keeps that style...the Gypsy King will be the King of the Heavyweights
When the highlights are boring. Josh could be a sleep therapist in his next career.
Joshua doesn't move the same anymore, he's not the same fighter, but I'm happy he got the win.
Aj would have had Franklin out in three rounds in his early career 😢
dillion white would have him now
Lol
riddick bowe cam beat two of them same time in his prime time :O They dont have footsteps
AJ's loses gave him the spirit of fear,you could see it in his eyes,legs,and arms.
Joshua has had his day, he should of got this guy out with in 8 rounds
Joshua showed Franklin a bit too much respect. Let´s face it, Joshua is not the same man he once was and I don´t  think he is ever going to win back a title if he cannot recover his mindset.
Joshua swings in slow motion now
Джошуа не Боксёр он клоун
Wilder vs Joshua!!!
Boring
Adrien broner effect is crazy… Aj caught it
Not worth wathing him fight anymore.
AJ fought well …. What is with all the hating on AJ   AJ was strong, composed and direct that is his style
He don’t got it no more AR did work regardless
AJ got no talent....
Joshua's working on his technique.
Joshua tree,,,big dude,lots of muscle,never ever gonna be champ again,his soul is gone
AJ lost from what I just watched 🤔
It was a decent enough performance tbh. Can't always get the highlight ko.
It’s simple. Joshua has bottled it.
Not one moment did I see Franklin out of the fight. He was in it to the end. These two biased commentators had him out every round. Joshua this Joshua that. Franklin boxed well and was still dangerous till the last bell.
Those were 'highlights' ?!?  zzzz
Omfg he is useless man 🤣🤣🤣
This looks like a mis match size wise
Nganou 🙅🏿🙅🏿🙅🏿
Not a convincing performance at all. Stiff, scared to throw and telegraphing his punches. I think the loses ruined him. Honestly he made his money now just retire he won’t go far. I think Dilian Whyte will beat him these days🤷🏻‍♂️
WOW,AJ now has gone to soon out of the real boxing excitement, no fire
light heavy weight vs heavy weight 😅😅😅😅.
AJ has been a great ambassador for the sport but it is for all to see he is not champion material and never has been, only the circumstances allowed him to have a shot at the world title... watching this fight was embarrassing, journeyman level, literally awful to watch.  As much as I like him, he should retire now before making it even more painful, his heart was stolen by Ruiz, and his skills were stolen by Usyk.. let's stop the PR machine before he gets hurt.
AJ's new fighting style is kind of wrong. Way too squeamish. He would have to return to his strengths and that is his muscle power and his boxing quality to have a fight and win. The current style is not what brought him to the top and will not take him further. The current style is neither effective nor worth seeing. These are meaningless victories that he achieves with the new fighting style. Someone like him should have a knockout victory as a claim. Like now, he can't compete against Wilder or Fury.
never liked any of his fights
AJ is sinking ship
Ya'll are just hating on AJ...He was playing it safe
Seems like Joshua needs 10 rounds to loosen up.
What a disaster of a fight. Boring to watch whole lot of grabbing
Joshua with the absolute technique of a Mii
He didn't win this imo. Biased location & judges..
He’s come of the back of 2 loses, he just played it safe that’s all
i say this in all seriousness, jake and tommy was a better fight
AJ has no more fights left in him, if he faces fury or wilder he will be dismantled
Sooooo boring and over rated
I would say after that fight just let go if you lose you lose, but if you win in that style no one cares
Usyk declassified Joshua... Now he fights with boxers of his level.
Aj is boxing smarter but against high competition opponents, there will not be that much room to work with.
And you say Aj can fight fury or dontey weather?
Boring fight
Why don t i agree with all those comments ? Thé Guy IS really scholar boxing okay , but that s perfect boxing and hé IS giving his opponent a Big lesson at least
AJ is not back, he is finnished.
He’s no chance after this performance with dollar-store deontay
I don't know if it's his reaction speed or he's just not a great counter puncher A.J .
AJ has been reduced to fighting amateurs 😂
Boring as he'll, if AJ is he world champion material he should😮 have put this guy down, never ever even heard of him. Poor display, all muscle no performance!!!
Aj back fighting tomato cans!!
anthony joshua vs ben simmons next
AJ is not the same and it's sad that the Wider vs AJ never happened. Hope it does in the near future
AJ ❤️
Yes
He needs to fight Luis Ortiz and Or Deontay Wilder b4 he calls out fury. I think he scared of Wilder.
Franklin is actually a great fighter .. respect to Joshua but he seems timid but still great fighter as well
Franklin is such a hugger
Think aj needs a few dance lessons to loosen up
Dude just watch MMA ..  Is this Fight ? 😅😂
Joshua Joshua Joshua🔥🥊🔥🥊🔥🥊🔥👑
Respect to Franklin, he isn't even a professional fighter. Dude worked in wool factory for 12 hours, supported his family and fought against Whyte.  He lost to both Whyte and AJ on decision but imagine full time Franklin who trained hard without the burden of working elsewhere.  He threw more power punches accurately Vs AJ, AJ outjabbed Franklin but Franklin threw more punches. Very unfortunate.  The victory is AJ but his opponent isn't full time boxer which is no disrespect to Franklin but disrespect to AJ.
Watched some of these “highlights” but lost the will to live at round 5 - I despair.
Bit of an odd sight to see AJ wearing everlast gloves. Usually, he'd stick to Rival or Grant
AJ is gunshy. Zero conviction. Should have put this man out. Pathetic.
Andy Ruiz trilogy 👀
Aj is a bullsht. A lot of meat, zero iq.
Really boring
Glad it wasn't the full flight , his opponent wasnt great and Joshua looked like the coaches paused him and the fight was on freeze frame
AJ is back? Pssshh I expected a knockout in this fight
AJ is utterly useless, he's an embarrassment, and should pack in boxing... He's just too nice a guy
watching AJ boxing is so boring. Ruiz really destroyed all his career
Joshua seems like he's scared to throw his own weight around he's an absolute unit an should be unleashing haymakers an dipping in an out with his jab an reach
All AJ needs is confidence to let his hands go and he’s a huge threat, but he’s honestly terrified
Fury,wilder said Joshua is my favourite in this decision now. There is no way fury can slip from wilder and Joshua like how he slip from wladimir klitschko.if there is a fight with fury and Joshua it will be brutal like the fight of fury & wilder.both men can be knock out and rise to victory.
strong chin😮
At best a split decision but I guess money is money
Passed his prime blood
Upper cut look crisp!
he can not fight ..what is this boxing... waste of time
Fury or Wilder eat this AJ alive…
Nobody is talking about the fact he has probably the best trainer in boxing in James in his corner! 😮
Don’t understand the criticism of AJ in this fight, he’s doing what is logical to do for this matchup, use his reach to assault Franklin why would he go in when he use his size advantage to keep Franklin at bay while still being able to hit him. You could even see Franklin getting frustrated
The Ruiz knockout and the usyk loses have made him scared
Won almost every round
AJ not the fighter he once was, been to a few of is fights and compared with how he is now the fire has gone, big shame as he was a scary fighter
Aj have not nutriciion havent reflex can not boxing
AJ ain't the same no more he looked paranoid in there
Joshua is one of the worst fighters I’ve ever seen
Joshua reminds me of Frank Bruno... muscle bound with a glass chin
कमजोर बॉक्सर ferniklin
A wet paper bag would be troublesome 😊
Joshua is a basic fighter skill wise
Time to hang them up, no chance against Fury, Usyk, or Wilder. He barely beat this punching bag and got Ko’d by an overweight Mexican.
I think I need to watch the whole fight as these highlights do not convey 90% of the criticisms being made about AJ in this fight. From what I can see here;  looked composed/focussed.   tried to make the height advantage work by maintaining distance (something he didn't do in either fight with Usyk and as a result, Usyk stung him at will.. and what was it Floyd said " The objective is to hit and not get hit").  Snappier with the jab and using his reach more.  Using the straight right in a more economical sense - In the past when he loads up he gases himself out like he did in rd5 against Klitschko and rd9 against Usyk (2nd fight). I dare say he's also taken note of Usyk as Usyk doesn't throw full blooded punches, he uses volume and angles which was where Joshua lost points. Franklin also didn't look like he was ready to fold.  Didn't look like he was fading in the 12th.  Using feints.  Looking for bodyshots more often.   It's borderline neurotic how ready people are to criticise this bloke.
Bro what happened to AJ he is totally different boxer! He doesn't improve his weaknesses! Still stiff and still using his face as a shield 🛡! 😒
13 minutes highlights?  A very boring fight one minute on the highlights is enough.  Joshua failed all the way
AJ is NOT back he was lack lustre and very average
I like the way Franklin fought and carried himself. Was still aggressive and throwing very powerful and dangerous shots throughout. Never allowed himself to look totally defeated.
Isn’t that the guy wilder smoked in the first round?
U lot know fk all about boxing aj was terrible he looked scared he's not world class any more shame but nope fury whyte or wilder would destroy  him
AJ fell off
Looks like Franklyn picked out for Joshua....John ex- amateur boxer
Back to fighting bums I see
When i saw the thumbnail, I thought it was KSI 💀
AJ should have knocked him out. He don't have that killer instinct like he did back in the day.
Joshua always looks short of imagination. He's a plodder.
MAKE HOLDING ILLEGAL IM SICK OF IT
Usyk is the King of kings Respect
AJ is well trained, strong, very fit!  but he does not have much style or magic!
What a boring fight. Had to skip the highlights here. As many have said he looks stiffer than ever and I think already it’s time to retire or go back to basics and risk getting knocked out but let your hands go. He forgets he’s in the entertainment business and this is terribly boring to watch. Credit to Franklin but any decent Heavyweight puts him down by round 7.
AJ is washed💩💩💩
Watching this live tbh I expected more but watching this back a few times a.j did everything right. Fundimentals looking so much better, can't wait untill he's more relaxed in this style and can loosen up a bit. Ring rusk gone! I think Dillion whyte next, then fury
Let down
What an absolutely disgraceful performance from the Referee Joshua constantly holding, Headlocks, in the 10th he was holding him behind the head while hitting him with uppercuts the ref did nothing in the 11th Joshua hit him on the break the ref did nothing Totally partisan as was the commentary, as for Joshua he will never be a great boxer a very boring and slow muscle bound performance, in against someone decent he would not last
Seems to be some new initiative by the referees to not physically touch the fighters. I have seen numerous fights lately where the ref verbally breaks the fighters which results in 10 seconds of down time. I am not a fan. Break the fighters and let them get back to it. All that will come of it is a cheap knockout in a championship fight a la Mayweather Ortiz.
When did this happen?
no one watched this on TV.
Who is that Antony Joshua ? 😂 AJ 👎 !!!!!
AJ is not the same fighter.
I’m not a Joshua fan and I’m American 🇺🇸 also , so I just wanted to see if there would be a difference. I personally was NOT expecting a KO because I knew this was AJ’s first fight with a new trainer from America. I think he did pretty well because I saw a better JAB already and he kept coming forward. When AJ fought Andy Ruiz in the rematch he did a lot of stepping backwards. I’m looking forward to more improvement with Derrick James and how their relationship develops over time . I think the expectation was way too high because in the society we live in today people want “ INSTANT GRATIFICATION “  ! Let the man take his time and develop with a new set of eyes ( Derrick James ).
I need a coffee. Falling asleep watching this.  P.S. ever heard of a combo, mate?
So boring this fight...😢
AJ is starting to remind me of Audley Harrison !
Ever since Andy Ruiz destroyed him, AJ has been fighting scared.
Is the blm belt vacant 🤔 I thought Lewis hamilton held that belt
Judge him on his next few fights. If he can get his confidence back then we might see  a boxer that can mix it up with the big boys again. It would be a massive mistake to take a Fury or Wilder fight next. For all those that are slating AJ,  get up there and do it yourself if you think you can do better. These guys are putting there lives at risk for our entertainment.  Have a bit of respect.
Notice Joshua didnt looked as gassed as he usually does towards the end? Derrick James training. See any Errol Spence or Jermell Charlo fight. They dont fade towards the end.
He’s doesn’t look satisfied with the win , he knows he lost his steam
This fight reminded me of the plastic toy boxing ring  from the 80s when you pushed their head down and the arms would punch but the toy was more fun to watch
"I'm very glad you won that fight Ant, but I am not impressed by your performance" - George Saint Pierre (Probably)
Christ I nodded off watching the highlights 😴😴😴
Wilder will devour this version of Anthony Joshua
Joshua is always back until he isn't 🤣🤣
Extremely boring fight 😴
AJ looks bigger
did anyone notice that the final bell went 5 seconds early...?
AJ shud resign from Boxing bcose he is not the person we know again
Terrible fight for Joshua. He was straightforward, he was very imprecise. Horror. After Usyk, he must have been disappointed in himself.
AJ should fight da Fury brothers..... @ da same time!!
AJ's done at the top level. No hand speed at all. Ponderous. Head still. Let Franklin push him about.
Commentary was tooo Bias😂
Went the distance?????? nah man!
2017 prime joshua is finish
He should knock him out cold by the 6th if we can put our faith back in Joshua… he just seems slow with his basic left jab right hand 🤬
AJ fights like a robot in video games.
‘This is brilliant from Joshua’ are you watching the same fight as the rest of us?
Richtig schlecht
He’s flat footed on entry and exit, he looks slow and amateurish, he is definitely there to be hit, his eyes don’t look like he wants it anymore.
Joshua has a glass jaw for a h weight too and he knows it
A bit embarrassing for DAZN considering all the hype, "the new dawn," all the AJ specials and the excitement DAZN generated for such a mediocre performance from such an over-rated boxer. DAZN's poster boy is a poser.
A paper bag, he might actually win convincingly
Trash
Unfortunately AJ is so over rated
seeing a lot of people say aj changed but i always thought he was overrated he was exposed by ruiz
They look like they are in different weight classes. Joshua is huge.
Look at Tyson, then look at this and tell me what do you see?.
Snoozefest
Needed a knockout for his head he’s a destroyer not a boxer hope he comes back fights whyte and has a banger 🥊
Joshua Flatters To Deceive...Throws a Punch and Then hangs On....He Is a man Who is More Scared of Losing rather Than Winning.  If He Goes In The Ring Against a Half Decent Fighter He will get Slaughtered...Get out While You Can Anthony Before Someone really Hurts You.
Aj is not safe... He is done.
Joshua lame
The most boring fight in a long time.
How long do you think either would have lasted against Mike Tyson? Lol.
He was paid to loose
Risk another loss by getting caught or play it safe knowing you will get the points.
Respect to Franklin,                              losing all 12 rounds is rough stuff but I'm sure he'll get the big Chisora fight next. Or does Aj get the chaance                                                                 😮
AJ not fearsome at all, not the AJ we used to know.. slow, heavy, leg movement very slow..
AJ treated Franklin like a Teddy Bear and hugged him all night🙈
Flat feet and stiff
When a fighter becomes civil, they lose something inside of them that very few people are ever able to find again. AJ used to be a savage rampaging beast that never held anything back! Just seems like that fire is all but, diminished and I hate it😞
Wow this was a pathetic performance
Looking back A.J did well. His 👊 didn't have the impact they usually have because he is punching downward and credit to Jermaine Franklin for being able to withstand them.  Other than that, based on these highlights, A.J did well in almost all rounds. I didn't see him being dominated by Jermaine Franklin. However, having as bloody short makes him look like he was bring beaten by a younger fighter.... Overall, A.J did way better than Dilllian.
Joshua would eat Alis jab all day.
La boxe de joshua fait peur sérieusement… il tiendrai pas 4 round face à fury et même Wilder
The dye coming off the gloves can't be too healthy
AJ is has lose his golden age...he is finished  !!!
Aj is big Ballon
Two bums doing it for money, taking this so called fight to 12 rounds
Josh just isn't bothered. He even hit the guy on the back of the head at the end. Just no. When he was declared he was actually shocked. He seems empty.
AJ vs KSI next
AJ has found his level here, Franklin is a decent fighter but not elite level. Both fury and wilder would put him away. AJ still hasn't excerised the demons of the ruiz fight, hopefully he gets fury fight and we can have a great fight.
5:33 me backing my dad up whilst he fights the local crackhead outside the pub
AJ Is done out… he’s career is now over for sure 😞.
Being tall without punching power is a disadvantage in heavy weight boxing. A shorter faster boxer is always at an advantage.
If he fight DW its night night 😂😂😂
He should probably stay away from wilder.
Did I watch the same fight as those who think AJ was bad here? AJ dominated this fight. If you haven't boxed before then you have no idea what these two men went through, especially as heavyweights. A huge improvement from AJ.
Tân công cưu đâm dut phat moi đuoc
Bư con ,a ko ap sat tân công thi lam sao đôi thu sơ
Joshua cant box no footwork
I dont know what everybody's talking about in the comments. AJ dominated the fight with his jab and brought back his boxing fundamentals. Respect to both men for a great fight. 👏💪
ring announcer is nowhere near the league of Ed Derian Chuck Hull Buffor Jimmy Lennon.
AJ needs to be a more fluid relax boxer. He is stiff and his jab is not used 😅enough. He is moving his head more but not enough punches thrown. Also if he doesn't improve his foot movement he can't beat Fury or none of the other top 5 heavy weight boxers at this point where he's at. They will turn and use angles and he will be 1 or 2 steps behind trying to set his feet. Not the same boxer when he was the heavyweight champion.
He lost his speed and footwork
Mehnn... Boring... Slow .. amateurish
You know a fight was boring when even the highlights look boring 🙃It seems Joshua now lacks the drive/mojo/killer instinct - call it whatever you want. Even when he shook Franklin, he couldn't finish him. He was just too reserved and unwilling to take risks during the fight.
SHOCKING 😂🤣👎🤫
Desapointing from joshua but I still think JOSHUA IS FINISHEX
It was an incredibly boring fight, but let’s just clarify something… the fact that everyone is saying AJ was slow, wasn’t showing his best or going for the KO, didn’t look like he wanted to be there, the fact that the fight on points was so one sided, goes to show where he is in comparison to Franklin and also Dillian Whyte (who had a tough fight with Franklin).   What I’m getting at is, the fight was so one sided, it also didn’t allow AJ to flex his boxing skills, power or anything
Joshua with that long reach advantage
Joshua is finished
To be fair to aj this is the best he’s ever boxed, fury aj is needed next
Big ups to the ref for letting them fight
He is no match for Tyson Fury
aj looks slow, stiff, no footwork again, Franklin outmatching aj at times, over all, a poor showing for aj
Iv got character
Commentators prob said franklin's name 4 times in all this highlights. Love boxing but bloody biased
they look 2 weigh classes apart
Who’s Joshua’s team? Coach? What’s going on with him?
AJ is DONE!!! He can’t beat any of the top 5 fighting like that.
the dickridin from commentators go crazy
I thought this was KSI v Joshua 🤯 from the Thumbnail 😂
Was it wrestling?
Zzz... 🥱
Very week
Racist can spend his winnings in his own peoples shops now!🤮
Whatever happened to the AJ who bulldozed and bludgeoned his opponents. No fire in his eyes when the result was announced!
AJ is a tall lad, but he isnt naturally big. Thats why he gasses so quick and moves so slow. Unlike Tyson who is naturally just huge
AJ vs Klitschko was 10/10. This was -1/10. Sooooo boring.
He looks disappointed he didnt knockout
Where are the body shots? Even though he lost, AJ honestly looked better in his last fight than in this showing.
Tyson Fury would eat up this AJ. Frank Bruno moved more fluently than this statue. He was just going through the motions to prove to his people he still had something left. No more warm ups he needs to fight Andy Ruiz in the trilogy... Unfortunately for AJ he loses that. If he fights Wilder I think Wilder will ko's him. No more Dillion fights please that proves nothing.
Joshua, a quick counter would knock you.. watch out for da quick counters.
He needs to call it a day he’s got enough money now lol
Stick a fork in AJ.  Fury would eat him alive.
The Man Is Back AJ💯👌🏿
Usyk really beat AJ so hard he regressed back to his first sparring session
I like AJ But Man He Doesn't deliver ,i think is time to let go.
People are hating on Joshua but his jab game will elite
11:48 that was blatantly illegal from AJ.
AJ is like a Mitsubishi Outlander— big but the horsepower (overall aggression and conversion with his hitting power) is extremely low.  He’s a gentle giant.
Mike Tyson should coach AJ AJ needs to be brutal before all this strength expires
نزال مخجل لجوشو
He is reserving his strength  For a better fight
Even though he won, Joshua looked slow.... His punches were only one or two.... The combination punches were gone.... You have to fight even harder if you want to beat Tyson Fury
Just wasted 13min
Aj korkun cesaretinin önüne asla geçmesin yoksa bu sahnelerde tutunamazsın
AJ needs that Rocky 3 montage when Rocky goes to the hood and learns footwork from Creed.. he's so flat footed and stiff as cardboard.
Wilder still the best , fury must retired
Time to start your commentating career AJ
AJ looks overwhelmed and lack of confidence makes Franklin to counter punch him
AJ is finish
Great right hand at the start of the 12th from AJ.  Any sport is based on being confident hence the nervous  performance from him.  This win over I’m gonna use by any means even going in with the head Franklyn will boost Ajs confidence.  Looking forward to seeing him next time.  Well done Aj.  Just needs more self belief and  get back to maximum violence. Get in there first and knock all your future opponents clean out. 👊
Watching AJ fight nowadays feels like drawing blood from a stone...
Joshua moves like a mobility Karen.
Congratulations to Anthony for the win,but he needs to be more aggressive and ruthless if he still wants to get to the top and reign again
A 13 minute highlight video of a AJ fight.  Lol.  You couldn’t make a decent 13 minute highlight video of his career
Boring...
Aj isn’t aj anymore lost his grip to The whole boxing scene scared to get him and scared to proper give it ago
This is not the AJ I will bet my dime on against Fury or Wilder
Very cautious not the same AJ after KD by Andy Ruiz.
AJ looks terrible. Can barely win over a D list boxer. Needs to cash in while his name is still around because in a few years no one is going to give him a time of the day.
One can see Joshua lacks some confidence... he needs to get that back asap!
For Joshua to be a great boxer, he needs to come to the USA and get a great trainer
Didn't look happy at all Why is he still fighting
Why was Joshua’s shorts and the refs shirt with light pink/red stains? Was it the gloves that caused their clothes to get stained?
Aj like grandpa
Fury v AJ is no longer a big fight as it won’t be competitive. 1 guy prepared to die n the ring against 1 guy scared to get hit. The same goes for Wilder v AJ. Wilder would retire him.
Thought i saw ksi on the thumbnail
Какой же, скучный бой.
Notice how rhese blacks try and surround themselves with blacks...the interviewer's a black the mc was a black....the corners were black...blacks are racist as white people try and mix and blacks don't....they obsess about skin colour and race...no wonder no one likes them
Joshua is built like Tarzan...Punches like Jane. The big out of shape Englishman Tyson Fury would totally carve him up
Franklin looked three times as confident as Joshua in there...
Joshua is boxing IQ is just as bad as his speed.
Wants no part of Tyson
ruiz destroyed t his guys confidence.
got about half way through and fell asleep
You'd swear there are a million professional boxers of top-tier level if you look around the comments. Imagine if they'd all shut the fk up and let the professional fighters....do the professional fighting.
AJ is back where?
AJ should work more on his mental side and bring that dawg back
Джошуа уматовый чебурек!
I love those Jabs. Some Errol Spence kind of jabs there.
It's finally time to face tyson and get that last mega paycheck before retiring . One of boxings biggest scams has come to an end
This is the highlights?  Imagine how boring the whole fight was!
joshua callin out fury after this performance made me laugh 😆
Mike Tyson would eat these bums for breakfast
Wow... I miss the old days
Bruno Bruno Bruno
I didn't know so many English people dislike their own boxer?  I wouldn't want to be a British boxer
AJ we love you bro an backin you.. Sometimes you have to take criticism to get better at your Profession.. I not no professional but been watching boxing for centuries.. Either step up the stamina levels or lose some weight.. We need you to be able float round dat ring for as long as possible.. Can see you got da heart bro! 🙏🏾
For aj’s redemption fight it wasn’t bad franklin fought well but clinged onto him like a desperate ex gf he just kept grabbing him it was frustrating to watch but i think he moves onto deontay wilder
Very poor commentary missed  half dozen over hand rights by Franklin that rocked aj maybe aj has found his level of opponents after his future is financially secured and his hunger is clearly in the psst.
He's no boxer feet planted soon as he fight some better he's finished
Aj is a big disappointment.
Lots of punches after the bell, pulling head down into shots etc. kicking off after the bell. Wish he showed that aggression in the fight and put Franklin away
Joshua's so slow & dusty, if feel sorry for him in a way, his time is done, time for retirement, boxer with a  promising beginning to become champion, to end dreadfully so quickly , sad to see a Nobody (really) beat him down, 😢... End of day's🥊🥊...
Take health tips 😜
Joshua is not what he used to be anymore, I wonder 🤔 if both fighters took on Lewis, Evander or Tyson at their boxing times, it would not last 12 rounds
Everyone criticised AJ’s performance, but it’s hilarious when you hear the same Boxers who criticised his performance want a fight him 😅 why don’t they chase some young fighters instead.
I reckon aj will beat Tyson 😂
Too much hate on AJ by people who probably have never stepped in the ring!!
Ruiz RUINED AJ
Wilder goes to AJ to knock him out of boxing
I said in the comment section of an older video, after the rematch with Ruiz, that the days of AJ the knockout artist were over. Now we would just get boring fights where he hides behind his jab for 12 rounds and wins on points. Got into a heated debate with a few AJ fans at the time. Just wanted to say I was right. I wish there was an easy way to search your comment history so I could find that comment.
A win is a win buuuut hopefully AJ gets his killer instinct back for the next fight
boxing can be such a boring thing.. i m out
“AJ is back” to what?… utterly unconvincing display against a plucky but very average opponent. Until AJ gets into a ring with a top tier opponent and wins, he will never get the respect that he feels he deserves. Personally, I don’t feel this will ever happen as he has been hyped up way beyond his ability, but I would love to see him prove me wrong!!!……
Anthony Joshua is not back yet... That's not him 😢
This version of AJ would be beaten so easily by Fury that personally it's not a fight I want to see. It's about time the public get what the public want and that's simple. AJ v Wilder, Wilder v Ruiz, Joyce v AJ, Joyce v Wilder and most importantly for the credibility of boxing the number 1 and 2 boxers in the world getting in the ring to fight. FURY v USYK. 👍
AJ securing a decision against an uber deiver
AJ too static and doesn't throw enough compilations
Heavyweight boxing is in an embarrassing state.
Whyte actually rocked Franklin in the 12 round, and hurt him better then AJ hurt Franklin in all 12 rounds, I know doesn’t mean everything, but Whyte was seconds from dropping Franklin
The days of Mike Tyson he can beat this two combined
Weakest comeback ever .. not really a comeback just doing wat he can to stay relevant AJs fans and boxing fans need alot more convincing
Hiw did the commentators miss all of franklins punches 😂
AJ is Black and that's about it....
12 round decision, garbage fight. "HE'S BACK!!!!!"
I don't think AJ's bodybuilding physique does him any favours. He looks slow, laborious and has little to no head movement.
AJ is back? haha he's washed now.
Great fight, AJ is definitely looking like more of a boxer than just a power puncher
Bias commentary
💩💩💩
Franklin dobrze się zaprezentował ale to nie ten poziom co AJ
Life support boxing,  the heavyweight division is on full life support, not worth the money.
Painted my house. I watched that dry
Nearly fell asleep..the presenter made it sound like a day at the horse racing 😂
As Muhammad Ali described Foreman, AJ is now....The Mummy...plodding and predictable.
why aj is slowly
Is it just me or did Joshua look nervous
He’s definitely changed his style
Aj is washed
AJ is so overrated who cares
AJ regained his confidence
AJ looks like a  petrified pugilist.....stiff robotic....waste of superb genetics....
Mike tyson şu an genç olsa AJ. İle maç yapsa kesinlikle yenerdi
Just like Frank Bruno. All power no Stamina.
I fell asleep watching the highlights bruh 💀
What has happened to AJ. Looking stiffer than ever. His footwork is getting worse and worse.
So nobody is gonna talk about how well AJ took Frnklin's best punches..... didn't even get shaken once.... while Whyte got hurt several times by Fanklin 😂😂
Aj looks like he has been cloned or I’m I tripping
Aj is not back, the fight was so boring i was falling asleep to it. No action
It’s unbelievable how terrible commentary is in boxing, these guys have no composure.
Franklin has the smallest head of any heavyweight I've ever seen, and Joshua took some massive shots that would have put him out against heavy-hitters like Fury and Wilder.
I am a Big fan of Anthony Joshua though I think he will never become a third time World Heavyweight Champion again as I feel he as he has lost his aggression and knockout instincts. I really hope he proves me Wrong though?
Usyk & Ruiz gave AJ trauma and nightmares for life.
Champions come and gone. Is normal , new kings are arising such as ursky, it is business, sport. AJ is GONE like Mike tyson, Muhamad Ali, joe frazier, Holyfield, Lenox Lewis, Sugar Ray........ one day gone. lets new king of boxe rise.
It was a decent fight
I like what derrick James is doing with AJ. Most fury's of punches I seen him throw ever. Trying to get that Errol Spence trade punches thing. Ok💪🏾🙌🏾
Aj have lost that old fire 😮
Gassiev next! Keep Fighting #
Nothing impressive here. AJ is not a top 5 boxer. Usyk, Fury, Wilder. All above him. Ruiz too.
there is a reason for why this sport is called boxing
Think one day Franklin could win titile as he took both the body snatcher and aj the distance
at first i thought that was KSI 💀💀
ไม่พัฒนาฝีมือเลยโจชัว
JOSHUA'S MENTAL IS SO LOW
AJ getting unfair Comments from the casuals as usual. I'm not really an AJ fan, I was intrigued by this match up because I knew Franklin wasnt only game, but has fast hands. Franklin has 24 rounds in the bag against AJ and Whyte... He is an active slippery operator. If he can increase his output or box on the front foot at times, he could go really far. He might be champ one day... Fury, Wilder and AJ won't be here in a couple yrs. Franklin only 29...if anything he has been a tad rushed...when you look at dubois, joyce as well as others... They are not fighting AJ's and the whyte's at 29 yrs old... That said, AJ tied Franklin up, he did play it safe... He has definitely worked on tieing up his opponent.... But I do think he needs to bring it back it a hit because it's decreases his offensive output. He tends to throw 1 or 2 shots... Never really follows up when he has caught his opponent
Lennox would have been exiting in this era
Joshua will never beat the Gypsy.
what has happened to AJs foot work....  Its all over for him i fear... he just stumbles around in there.
Best action? Definitely after the final bell pmsl!!
He's not been the same since Ruiz , frustrating to watch him turn to a robot.
Before Ruiz vs After Ruiz is todays AJ
You cannot carry the name Joshua (a conqueror) in a strange land and expect the vigor, strength and victory of the real Joshua (In the Bible). Maybe he needs to retrace his way and come to the one (Jesus) who is able to give him all round victory.
boring😅
Everybody on here saying AJ lost his touch. Truth be told AJ does not like fighting shorter fighters. Look at his resume of of shorter fighters. Either a loss or lack luster performance. This guy gave AJ no reason to not let his hands go. Shorter fighters give AJ problems.
Bruno mk ll  so limited in ability.
Such a wooden board lol
AJ, boring. He's done.
Sloths in the ring
Can't get too excited about Joshua.
He's got it all there from him, his left hook and back hand when put together can put anyone down, just doesn't seem to want to risk putting more than 3/4 punches together cos he knows he can be hurt
Wilder would destroy AJ. End of.
The right hand of AJ must improve mobility especially counter offensive
AJ lost this fight , Franklin was robbed for sure
He is not Usik
Pour moi il n'est pas encore au sommet... Il y a du chemin
no intense no excitement  such a boring fight😎
Joshua looks the worst I ever seen him to heavy
AJ  lose this  fight..
It's crazy how there was so little promotion for this fight, only just found out they had a fight when i clicked on this video, also boxing these days is boring as to watch, misfits boxing is so much more entertaining, as well as the ufc
Aj saved but tony bellew score card. Tony must of been watching eastenders
AJ man 🤦🏻‍♂️. After you beat Vladamir this is not how i visioned things going, your stock has fallen so far in the space of 4 fights.
I wouldn't mind seeing Wilder vs Joshua
They need to start getting people in there with the same reach
Joshua will lose with Wilder,Usyk or Fury he dont haved
How old was Klitschko when AJ was fighting him 😄
AJ is the worst boxer I've seen in years!
AJ isn't ready for the top fighters.
retire
Unfortunately I believe AJs peak is past him now..looks heavy in his legs and the combinations have gone.. I hope he doesn't carry on thinking he has to prove anything..get a few bucks in the bank and brush up on your TV skills big man..no disgrace stepping down..you've down yourself proud ..
The arrogance of losing 2 championship matches, beating a no one and automatically thinking you a shot at Fury?
Obviously not as exciting but isn’t it smarter to be more methodical and pick your punches?
I just realized the ref has best view of fight ,and he can stop them when ever he wants . 😂
joshua will never get an ounce of respect until he gets in the ring with fury or wilder.  period.
For once watching AJ I see fear  Not the AJ we use to know. Man lacks confidence
AJ has come down a few notches to what he was. I can't see him going up against any of the top world class heavy weights now
Ennuyeux 😭😭😭
Not me, no thanks. Joshua is been done long ago.
I couldnt get past the 7th round (highlights), I want my time back
Joshua's over carefulness has led to his under usefulness. The spark was scarce. The caution is much. I see him waking up to higher competitions.
This fight had to be asz…highlights are them just standing in front of each other.
AJ seems to struggle with pace...you just can't understand why his big body isn't helping...shameful raising his hand like an exhausted railroad worker
Horrible fight
JOSHUA NO TIENE OPORTUNIDAD, NI CON FURY, NI MENOS CON WILDER.
A shorter, unfit boxer as his first opponent back. Probably a wise move to ease him back into things, but no real indicator of how he will move forward.
AJ fights like a robot
AJ would struggle against Frank Sanchez
AJ is not fun to watch anymore 😢
Joshs worst boxer
Aj nadaje się na tancerza,ale bokser już z niego żaden.Przepraszam,że tak powiedziałem
Aj too cautious,afraid  of taking pouches for a heavy weight, he is yet to fully  recover  from the experience  of Ruiz, I just think he is overated
DAZN so biased towards English fighters. I haven’t gotten half way past these highlights and they are not giving any credit to Franklin - not that he won. But he did put some hands on Joshua.
Josh’s he just doing for money he is no Mach for furry toys
Joshua takes soo long to get a comfortable rhythm, stiff as a board for the first three rounds. If this guy had the skill of a Jon Jones or Mayweather, or aggression of a Tyson or Foreman, he would be a monster with his strength and stature
That's not enough to get to the top and stay there. Joshua is scared. He has no heart and no will, since losing to Ruiz he has become very weak mentally.
British fighters have no chin it’s something in the air
Joshua’s tune up fight going 12 rounds with no knockdown is hilarious…..  hang it up fam.  You’ve been exposed
I BET!  I bet AJ will KO the Jypsy King. It's only on that fight AJ does not  care to lose.
Franklin's a beast look forward to seeing more from this lad
Aj fights so stiff
AJ is not aggressive at all and always get tired towards the final rounds. Only Jabs with his left hand the whole fight, Come On got to left loose that right hand otherwise will only go the distance or be beaten by someone who throws punches
I appreciate how fast after the fight you guys compiled the highlights. BIG respect
Watching AJ now compared to AJ when he fought Klitschko is like watching 2 different men. Stiff, slow, scared to let his hands go. Ruiz changed him.
why the final round bell in England always rings before the time is up to save AJ? same thing happened in Usyk fight 7 or 8 seconds before the end.
A TREMENDOUS LEFT UPPER CUT ???.DONT MAKE ME LAUGHT
For a fighter the size of Joshua, becoming a counter puncher makes absolutely no sense. Seemed like he forgot his right hand in Texas. He should be going in there and bullying the likes of Franklin
To all the experts criticising Joshua get in the ring with Franklyn and show us how it’s done. 🙂
he couldnt knock snow off a rope ,AJ. hes in it for the money ! or whats left of it ,TOTAL SHAME .
this Franklin guy is a useless fighter
Complete FAIL... SHOULD HAVE BEEN A K.O.
Mannnnn Anthony ain't ready for the "Bronze Bomber" or the "Gypsy King"🤷🏾‍♂️
nah he's still down there
He's STILL TOO PASSIVE....  LOOKS LIKE HE HAS ADDED TO HIS INSIDE GAME... BUT STILL HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OF THE CLOCK BY ROUND 5...  HE STILL TRYING TO WORK OVER TIME INSTEAD OF JUST IMPOSING HIMSELF ON SUCH A SMALLER MAN.....
AJ's best days as a boxer are behind him!!!
Naaaaaa... I'm sorry but in MY MIND, HE CAN NOT BE AJ AGAIN UNTIL HE GETS HIS LICK BACK FROM USYK!!!! AND I MEAN A K.O......ONLY DEMONSTRABLY!!!
I do hope AJ is able to come back as soon as possible. From hie expression, looked still in low level confidence. And speed is much slower than before, maybe he is purpose to do that for strategy reasons.. Anyway, congrats to AJ.
WOW! Great fight, but l wish he could have fought uysk the same way. He looked aggressive, confident, and tactical. Franklin is not on the level with Joshua. I will say he could be a great sparring partner but a contender.
Bad boxing from AJ but what a horrendous job from the referee. UFC match at times.
Give AJ some credit he won  It wasn't a convincing win but a win all the same
Joshua won't stand a chance with Fury or Wilder.
Boring
I fear that AJ will end up like whyte and chisora. Just in it for the money fighting on a domestic level
Jermaine is more active
Next up Abel Sanchez
no  es el mismo jhoshua,   pelea con Andy y lo nokea  con Wilder y este le hace un daño,  un globo este Sr. no lo veo llegar.
Andy Ruiz change AJ, after the first fight Anthony was never the same...now is afraid of getting hit. He will be easily KO by Wilder and Fury no doubt about that.. the heavyweight has only 3 fighters.. #1 Fury #2 wilder and # 3 Andy Ruiz.
I don’t no why Joshua gets so much hate” he did a great job in this fight” he applied pressure “ combination & power and was countering . Wasn’t beating by every punch “ I give him a 9 in my opinion.
A.J seems to have lost the heart for the boxing game,
AJ vs Francis nganou
AJ knows that his chin and ability to take a punch are severely compromised, and he fights like it.
Boring 😂
Still poor enough to fight with GYPSY KING 🤴
Wish joshua would go away he's a racist
Franklin was tough and game. Solid fight.
Сумнівне рішення!
And people wanna say guys like this would beat Ali and the old school fighters.
Watching round 6 nothing has been a highlight 😴😴😴😴🤤😵‍💫
Another Frank Bruno ya no whatta mean Harry
The boys don't hold a candle to Mike . Clay was great but Mike had the killer mind set . These boy don't have the mind set . My opinion , don't get your shorts tied in a knot . p/s the boys here would clean my clock with one punch .
AJ😂😂he's one  of the cheater boxer like may runner weather holding the arm of there opponent out of sight of the referee... 😛😛😛
Imagine paying for AJ to fight a guy way below his level like this...seriously went to points...the guy fought nobodies and lost to Dillian whyte and AJ can't give us as explosive knockdown let alone a KO...move on guys to some quality fighters
From the highlights only, ive got Joshua ahead. Definitely taking a point for hitting on the break in the 11th unless the opponent was also using shady tactics
This match didn't prove anything for AJ, Hasn't been the same boxer since that 2nd L. Wasn't impressed at all.
Andy Ruiz Jr Told Me....He Ain’t Giving AJ Back His Bottle 🍼  This Sport Ain’t For The Faint Hearted....You Can’t Box Scared.....  I See Glimpses of Mike Tyson vs Frank Bruno.....AJ Is Frank Bruno 2.0  Thanks For Some Great Nights AJ....But it’s Over Mate....
Would of personally called that a draw and maybe got them to fight again. It was clear that it was very back and forth both men gave it there best but it was a hard one to call so a draw would of be the best decision
Prime AJ would knock him out in the first round.
Andy Ruiz took Joshua's soul/heart when he hurt him in the first fight, and he doesn't look like he'll ever get it back. Too timid to really mix it up now.
Atless hemi mentenem kasem 12 raond....
There's only 1 GOAT from the modern era, that being Lennox Lewis. Fury, Usyk, Wilder, and AJ are not on the same level. There is hope, and his name is The Juggernaut
Joshua keeps pulling and holding Franklins head down and shooting uppercuts. Joshua should have had a knockout by R6 to be considered a serious contender.
Maybe it’s just me but I don’t think Anthony looked that impressive in that fight
Jermaine Franklin won this boxing match, connected more hits overall with more combinations. The only reason Anthony Joshua officially won is because he is a household name and the fight didn't end in a stoppage. Jermaine Franklin is a top fighter and was cheated out of two fights against two top boxers including Dillian Whyte.
If these were the highlights, where were the dull parts?
I think Frank Bruno and AJ would have been a fair fight. 💯🇯🇲🇬🇧👍
Love watching the fourth best heavyweight in the UK oh wait no I don’t 💀
AJ is ok when his target barely moves unlike when he fought Usyk. Like to see him fight Wilder would be interedting to see how he handled pure aggression. Might actually make him open up more.
Francis Nganu
Bruno 2.0 is fukked if he ever fights Fury.
AJ has most definitely changed. Maybe it's the losses, the mountain of expectations to be the face of England, The Heavy Weight Division, humility can also bring us back home,  but there was a tenacity he had, a ferocious aura and while he seems to be a bit more technically polished, I think he now knows that the mystique has faded a bit and people are no longer "scared" of him. This leads to being a bit more cautious and less of a risk taker, because in the back of your mind, you're still replaying the losses. A lonely place to be and that is mentally, figuring out the rubics cube of life as a fighter and how it's juxtaposed with all the alley ways of life.
I hope that is not the case but I don’t see AJ getting his belt back!!!!
Ffs fight Fury.
Franklin is a fearless boxer (fighter) he attacked almost all the rounds. 💪
Aj lost it man
most underwhelming highlights ever
Very unimpressive
Wilder would anialate him, too easy to hit
@gurulive2.0
Hardly a ferocious or commanding return. Aj always looked a decent combination away from down. Nope nothing there to ignite refreshed interest nor suggest or convince that he’s an exciting prospect as challenger to any of the top 3 HW’s.
Check out Burmaine Franklin!🤣
AJ just embarrassing at this point lol
AJ needs to learn how to throw combinations to break down his opponents, or he'll make it to tyson fury
AJ 😂 need vacation
AJ might be a top 5 heavyweight.
Boxing at its most boring state😂 very slow fight
I think AJ should have thrown more body shots.... Frank was like a bobble head opponent....Dude can take some punches!!... Like is that all u got.. Lol
Yea I think Wilder beat Joshua  I think fury beats him .I think Joe Joyce beats him .and possibly Daniel dubious .he just ain't gonna get by those guys.
Don't know much about boxing but this is kinda boring compared to the Mike Tyson era.
Great 😃😃😃😃😃😃 Job Ad bring on loser
Where is this man's stamina?
Frankly he was just trying to survive always dipping he head low if try to fight more I think he would of got KO'D
Garbage.
Joshua will never be the greatest fighter can’t even knock down this opponent most the great fights go to 12 rounds win on points  Waste time go to watch him fight  I pay $500 to watch Mike Tyson only for first rounds win knock out  Am very enjoying my $500
AJ picked a cherry to fight?
Joshua is  was and will always be some  trash😢
Joshua is Boring
He doesn't have any combos, just "well-timed heavy punches", patience in fighting his opponent.
The Under Armour white trunk of AJ shows defeat. Sad.
AJ needs lots of sparring, he needs to take a little break from matches, and perfect himself in training camps for MONTHS!!!!
Ruiz changed everything on this guy.
AJ looked stiff as a brick. Hiney blew his back out again.
Well done Joshua. Franklin clinching fore dare life
I feel like Franklin had to work hard for what he did against AJs height and long arm span. It was gonna be a challenge, but to say AJ won is quite sad really, as he looked hungry and up for it, while AJ looked like he was fighting a younger kid at school.
is back is back, dagu kaca
What a boring fight, Joshua couldn’t even knock a tomato can out.
poor performance.
Hopefully we can have Anthony Joshua vs Dillian Whyte next 🙏🏽
12:38 aj gets buckled and heald up by franklin😂😂
Pretty tragic to be honest
Aj vs fury
Back for what? To get pummeled by the Gypsy King.?
Andy Ruiz broke this guy seemingly forever
He keeps fight bums!! Scared of that real smoke!!
Killer instinct totally gone looks like just a pure boxing now who’s rather keep on the outside
still scared of Tyson fury
Matatan 🤔 Ribirin HS, Boxing time.🥊.
AJ is what they call in boxing trainer circles "gun shy"  he's scared of getting big hits. Obviously no boxer wants to get hit. But being gun shy is a psychological thing that makes the boxer perform badly .
AJ did not look elite at all.
In the Terminator voice"ill be back"bodybuilders lost his 🐕  he needs to find it or fury n wilders are gona yam him up for breakfast but i think franlin was just a durable opponent other man would have crumbld.
AJ getting those rounds in. It looked like AJ hurt him in the 3rd
Joshua should go back to his old trainer. The one that he was undefeated with. He was a winner and a better looking boxer than he is today.
Well done Joshua!! I'm neutral but Joshua smashed it easily.
Most boring fight
Wilder or Fury would smash josh hard.
AJ keeps trying  to point box. He's not standing on  his punches    he's thinking  to much its mentally  draining him. He should  use his attributes  abit more.  Considering  aj  struggles with short fighters. He done quite well
Wilder will knockout both of these dudes in the 1st round!
Stiff... no flow to him, and with all that muscle armour, man doesn't want to move forward & let loss. Not the best fight I've scene and in no way is he close to being ready.  In the later rounds he opens up and you can see  a glimpse of what he is capable of....was this a measured performance on purpose or is this just where he is?
AJ should shamelessly steadily keep building into his new style. Not entertaining like an explosive knockout but it's beautiful. I want to see more variety and versatility. Let's see what he comes up with.
Im not an expert , AJ MOVES TOO HEAVY… light movement . The road back to the top  will be worth it go champ go!
Kto będzie następny Najman z Polski😂
Aj still a savage
Anthony's eyes look dead, the fire is completely gone.
AJ doesn't throw combos anymore, just weak jabs and hugging for 12 rounds... If he repeats this in his next fight I'll stop watching his fights
AJ is not back!!! he is done, he is nor any more one of the bigger fighter in that division.
Fighting tomatoe cans now 🤦🏼‍♂️
The fact a nobody hit Joshua so easily tells you all you need to know. All credit to Franklin he showed us all exactly what AJ is a domestic decent fighter and that’s all he ever was to be fair. Wilder would knock him out inside 4 rounds.
Boring fight …,  Why doesn’t this guy fight a bigger name fury or wilder
He was just slapping him around a little bit lol
AJ needs to fight Deontay. This Heavy weight division is a joke. Taking to long to see fights happen
Who's Jermaine Franklin? Joshua doesn't and never has it? Avarage at best.
to hyped up for what he is
joshua, is a B flat fighter. hes not really a gifted fighter in his class.
Aj retire if he fight again he is going to lose
AJ is still trash 🥱🥱
Didn’t stomp the gas pedal. That’s exactly what I thought. I liked how textbook he was the first few rounds (Didn’t see much of Joshua’s fights), though by the 5th, completely dominating the opponent, I was waiting for him to go into next gear, which he never did. I closed the fight after the 8th round.
Boring 1-9 rounds from those 2 Ladies, Joshua is no longer fit.
I’d like to see Ruiz vs Franklin
Not a great fight but AJ playing it more smart as you can tell he didn't gas out by rounds 7-8 like he did in previous. A certified win and commentators pointed out he's back to basics. Would love to see him perfect those basics but also get back to slugging heads off of shoulders inbetween that
🎯 Josh You need big matches, either to restore your glory or to end your career.
Not impressive at all from Joshua... a more skillfull, faster fighter will take him down, he'll gas out in 6 or 7 rounds. It's over for him....😅
These are the highlights? I've seen more intense sparring sessions.
AJ just ain’t him no more
He looks more tentative now. The losses to usyk and ruiz  really made him a different fighter which is not surprising.  Just not that  excited to see his fights anymore
Joshua looks like a robot
It should be renamed AJ bits of the fight as you cut out Franklins stuff  LOL  . I wonder why?  Make AJ look better as he is your man ...
AJ is not back, his carrier is more like finish. He is like afraid in Ring, He looks very bad against Franklin and Franklin is a really weak opponent! AJ is no more danger as Boxer, not against anyone from the Top 10-15 guys.  HE IS MENTALLY BROKEN…. BETTER FOR HIM HE END HIS CARRIER, HE MAKES ENOUGH MONEY NOW HE CAN MAYBE GO TO HOLLYWOOD BETTER FOR HIM BUT NOT BOXING BECAUSE HIS FIRE IS OUT❗️
Joshua please keep away from Tyson Fury cos if you don't your career will end badly,🤷‍♂️
Was boring and the talk about he's back with that performance and calling out Tyson behave if you really want to prove your back fight wilder
When he's nose started to bleed, looks like AJ was gonna cry lol
tesco value highlights
Man aj used to be a bull dozer now he just fights too cautious and he’s got a glass chin.
Wilder 🇺🇸 v AJ 🇬🇧 !! Make it happen.
No no no , Something is missing. This is not my brother AJ on that stage. Alot is missing here. I think he needs to come to Nigeria let's re-ignite his inner powers and IQ  in full momentum
La cosa più bella è stata la panciera di Franklin , un po’ più in alto ed arrivava al petto
AJ has not been the same since Andy Ruiz, seems like he fights not to lose instead of fighting to win now yk
AJ will never win a top flight boxer anymore
Seen better fights behind the bike sheds at school..
All credit to Franklin - he's a tough fighter, stood up to some big shots from AJ (and Whyte). He was also able to spoil AJ's work in the later rounds and tie him up. I don't feel as negative about AJ as most people do, I think there are some positive signs. He's just come off 2 straight losses, he's started with a new trainer and gone right back to basics, this was a big comeback fight with loads of pressure. He needed the win and he won convincingly. And he still looked pretty fresh in the last round, no signs of gassing out early. If you look at the 10th Round, there were some signs of the old Joshua, he's still able to turn on the aggression and put together some decent combinations. He will take confidence from this win and hopefully come back more aggressive next time. Let's see what happens next time.
Boring
Worst UFC fight ever
Congratulations on the win... But this is still not the AJ of the earlier boxing period. Don't know why he bulked up for the fight. He is still over thinking on what to do...
I rather watch UFC
AJ boxed cautiously with his retirement remarks as a reminder to not loose. Happy too that it went full rounds to his benefit of a gained stamina and experienced gained. Hopefully at a title fight it will be no holds barred.
I rather watch an old pacquio fight
He’s got as much courage as Audley Harrison.
I was always a Joshua fan and have watched all his fights live, except this one. He used to be fast and heavy handed and aggressive, now very slow and non aggressive. Only positive is his footwork is much better, but at the expense of everything else. Looks like he's trying furys style of hit and hold, very boring, really think his heart and desire for the tare up have totally gone. This AJ isn't long off another loss if he continues as is.
I prefer lightweight boxing
Someone explain to me why this was 12 rounds too? As it wasn’t for a championship...
Would not pay to watch AJ fight, If you’re going to be that scared why fight, instead retire!
Like watching paint dry
I'm rooting for Aj but if he went 12 round like this cam he really take on and beat TF? From commentaries I've heard it's they agree AJ has the fitness level it's the mental capacity AJ is battling with. So I say AJ tap into your Naija roots, woof down some poundo  Yam  and tap into your psyche.
Blessings all great watch here "RIDE OR DIE" BY IVOR MYERS EX HIP HOP ARTIST FROM THE BRONX ENJOY POWERFUL UNMISSABLE WATCH LIFE CHANGING WATCH 🙏🏾❤️🙏🏾
Very unimpressed
He don’t know how to fight on the inside he looks very stiff doesn’t fight tall or use his jab to his advantage he was supposed to make a statement this isn’t a AJ is back moment...
Joshua fights like he knows he can’t take a shot.
He is utterly skill-less.
Ma boy AJ aint got the hunger like before yow 😢
Wilder will knock AJ out and it'll be easy ... Fury will play with AJ and knock him out  ... Go enjoy ya money mate
Josh is a by-product of his culture
AJ is finished
He’s very slow and rigid AJ. Reminds me of Ali impersonating George Forman.
Joshua and Joe Joyce to fight next that's what I say
This is why boxing is trash I didnt even know about this
Again NOT fighting Fury or Wilder. Boxing as a sport is dying.
AJ it’s too slow. AJ can do better for sure yet it’s up to himself.
Might as well go bk to Tony Sims
Who else saw AJ has improved in stamina? Big credit to Derrick James
AJ has improved a bit, he need to improve more on his speed
Joshua is the first fighter I came across that has a strong phobia for taking punches.
Robot Joshua…. Modern day version of Frank Bruno
i got to say a solid performance by AJ there! especially against an awkward & very durable opponent! He CAN reach the top again!
AJ doesnt want it anymore. You can se he’s not hungry anymore. Wilder is hungrier and Fury is smarter and harder to hit. As of right now he would lose to both. Plus its scary how easy he can get hit. Sheesh
Still crouching and bending down forward with high hands, no matter the trainer he doesn't use his height advantage. Seems uptight like Bruno, needs a more relaxed stance.
Joshua you blagger.
AJ is finally finished. To prove it, he should fight Deonaty Wilder. 😤 🥊🥊 but he'll stay clear of him. 🤯🤯
I don't understand the negativity. I absolutely loved this AJ. He's a pure boxer now, not the slugger of 8 years ago (which I also loved). Super slick, leaning to tire him out. I just wish he just managed to force himself more on Usyk and wore him out too. But Usyk simply was slicker. Nevertheless, people don't realize how big of a threat this AJ is to the division. AJ can slug the bigger guys and box the little ones. He boxed the p4p for 24 rounds don't forget that.
AJ IS BACK? I wish he had some GRIT in him.. he should have KO'd this dude if we're being honest.. but did enough to win for sure.. but is this a big statement?
He's turned from Frank Bruno into wlad Klitschko!
Hes back?  😂😂😂😂😂😂
No way AJ is a big name anymore, he has to box the best now or retire. He is afraid to make a mistake and it is not the way a big name boxes. Retire now after a win is his best move...
The referee took no action when Joshua held Franklin's head with his hand and beat him with the other. He also held his head in his hand. The judge should be fired!
Did people pay to watch this cack
How did he used to be world champion? 😂
I dont think the chapter can be closed until he faces Fury. I think that will be AJ meeting the end of his career.
When was this
Not interested in watching AJ fight lower tier fighters I'm a fan but I think it's over at this point
AJ is a girl. Aren't they supposed to punch each other? Lamest fight I've ever seen 😂
Aj never been the same since he was sparked by the fast mexican.
AJ trash he still wouldn't hang with a wilder or fury
Bakhodir Jalolov chemp
Josh needs a better camp.. fury would make lite work of him
Lame at best...
Joshua NEEDS to spend 6 months with Lennox to learn how to jab properly ... with SPEED and POWER. Pawing isn't a jab it just allows Usyk to time you
AJ's hands are pretty slow
Never heard of him
Aj Show him that He is The baby Mama
I think these British ring commentators went to JOSHUA hotel room after the fight and serviced him. They should be neutral as can be instead of Joshua Joshua Joshua.  Sickening
Antony is boring off late he can’t box
Meh.
AJ  looks like my 91yr grandmother  trying to throw combinations. 😂😂
Played with him.
Joshua was finished 5 years ago. He’s just a journeyman now. Just boring. Please retire.
has been
Boring, boring, boring
If this is the highlights, I can only imagine how boring the fight was.
Joshua didn't make enough of a statement for a title fight. Joshua vs Wilder needs to happen instead
Okay...let's break this down..... AJ hasn't fought for a while,and lost his last two fights to a pound for pound great,going the distance twice!. His confidence obviously had to take a hit with them losses. He's fighting a guy, Franklin,who got himself into great shape for this fight. He's a relatively unknown fighter, who's never been dropped,or stopped. Tough as they come, he's quick with an excellent chin and stamina. He's ranked in what,top 30 or something...rankings don't mean squat these days, he'd probs beat half the people in the top 30,let's be real. He beat Whyte,even though he wasn't given the result,and he wasn't even in great shape for that fight,was his first proper camp!. Give AJ credit,yeah it wasn't his best performance,but he needed the win,and he got it! Looked decent in the second half of the fight,and went the distance no problem. Congrats AJ!!..on to the next. Respect to Franklin.
Joshua is a cheater
AJ himself looking disappointed with the fight. The face on him at the decision was bored. At least he won by a distance, he probably expected more from himself.😮Shock...... where is the dog in him gone, Povetkin, Whyte, Pulev, Takam, Klitschko.
Joshua like a journeyman, flat footed and wooden.i say wilder next.
Did he make another cringy speech at the end?
😢.
Boring
AJ Is a has been now ..
Watch the documentary of Usain Bolt, the fastest man in the world. It will give you a better insight into what AJ is experiencing. Fear, doubt and a lack of motivation are human traits that come with the pressure of greatness. He is human.   It's easier to get to the top, than to maintain being there. Before you continue with the thread of criticisms, ask yourself if you've been consistently great at anything in your own life.  Its funny that even people stuck in a job they don't like or a pattern of habits they hate, will also have the guts to tear down a man that has gone from prison to greatness.  Please... Give AJ a break. It's okay to fall. I remember the days he made us really proud.  Rise again my friend... Rise again AJ the great. I believe in you bro.
Aj  all joke on the side your terrible an you want to fight Tyson fury
Ha, kin shyte.
He should fight Whyte next. Whyte is a chance to let hands go and get a ko, whytes chin isn't great.
Shot people are very difficult to beat
Crazy how much Wilder and Joshua fell off, shame we didn’t see that peak fight.
Am not a boxer ,but on a more serious note Joshua fights like he's scared to punch his opponent,he punches like a girl😂😂
They both look like tomatoes 🍅
AJ is WHACK*
Joshua is far away of the top fighters fury usyk wilder. A wilder's punch go through the joshua's defence and knock down joshua.
U don't see anyone bleeding but I see Joshua shorts and the refs sleeves turning really red lol
This is how AJ should have been fighting from the beginning
He not touching Wilder or fury
As AJ gets older - he's beginning to look as ponderous as Frank Bruno!
AJ is terrible
Re affirming that he is the most un entertaining heavy weight fighter ever......
Let's be sincere AJ reminds me of Charley Chaplain's boxing 🥊 video I watched
Thats what everyone has been wetting themselves about? Fury must be shaking in his boots!
Franklin does not have KO power, lucky stationary AJ robot
Joe joyce would beat him now
Joshua needs to Retire 🗑️
Joshua kept grabbing the back of his head. It’s OK if he does it though.
A fight with Tyson Fury would be utterly pointless.
AJ doesn't seem to throw his punches using the leverage of his body, or turn of the hips. He doesn't break the distance with his punches. No doubt they seem powerful, but not explosive.
with a performance like that he'll never get the belt back
He need more time with Derrick James
His not champion anymore, he must reset the mentality.
Maybe smaller fighters are difficult for AJ
AJ seems so one dimensional with his boxing no real combinations always looking for that right hook and he's so flat footed he's not the same fighter who he used to be which is a shame tbh
For the size of aj he looks so scared to do anything...boxing these days is so boring
Ok fans you want a win have it
Boring aj shying away from knockouts playing it safe boring fight
Wider will destroy him
AJ is still a star and is making his come back I hope he fights fury or wilder one day
Come on, how can they say AJ won when he's a 2-time heavyweight champion who went 12 rounds with a roofer?
Joshua is another Bruno
He didn't even get into 3rd gear. He wasn't confident at all. Looks like he didn't even want to be there!
AJ looks poised. Fast hands, but very little movement. Looks very cautious and almost afraid. No sign of brute violence and predator instinct. When he was up and coming he did look like the perfect boxer, maybe if he gets his confidence back he might still be up fer it but  idk, maybe usuk and fury are just on a different class after all.
I miss Mike Tyson.
Time for Joshua to hang up the gloves
This was a boring fight
We need someone like Mike Tyson to save boxing
Joshua must work on his speedy
Joshua pugile mediocre senza talento ne cuore👎
Try Tyson Fury. AJ seems to avoid him?
How is going to box fury? With this?
I'm really surprised how an aggressive and an enthusiastic boxer like Joshua can lose so much steam in such a shot time.
Yeah nobody can't rock with Tyson Fury right Now no reason to come out retirement
His back.....😢 I run to press play to see what round his opponent got knockout........its a dcision fight....50/50 to gain his belt back
Bruno mk2
Very sad boxing's is going down 👎👎👎
Ja pierdziu jakie nudy
I hate to admit it but a Hungry Fury would dance around and box Joshua's head off.😊
Wilder would knock AJ out inside 3 far play to Franklin stayed the 12 rounds but let's face it wouldn't last 6 v any of the top ranks hand picked fight for AJ and couldn't put him away
I believe aj has been shock up from his last event . He was alot better in the younger days.  Very cautious now . But I don't think he has a chance against Tyson
Bodybuilder with stiff body and no footwork. No wonder why he got schooled by usyk 24 rounds...
Them commentators can try to make it as exciting as they like. But it's poor. I don't think he's got that ' killer'that he had before the Ruiz fight. Tyson ducked him then. Tyson would probably take him now without a problem. Which makes me sad. Wilder right hand would give AJ nightmares. AJ just not aggressive enough and easy to hit
Dossers
Raving Bonkers!
Like an aging pit pony, Joshua delivers yet another lacklustre performance. He won't be able to cope with a heavy hitter like Fury and any opponent who has speed and agility in their locker, would not only run rings around him, they'd probably do him some serious damage too. Joshua was never a memorable belt holder and definitely not world class. So AJ, if you're listening, take the pay cheque and shuffle off into retirement.
Yawn.
Fue un combate de poca emotividad, más para el bostezo que para el aplauso. Joshua fue demasiado conservador ante un Franklin que no es figura de primera. Pareciera que hubiera perdido la confianza tras las dos derrotas frente a Usyk. Si es así debe someterse a un tratamiento psicológico que le devuelva esa garra y empuje de sus tiempos de sólido campeón.
AJ looks like he has lost his passion for the sport
Lambat x maen nya joshua..
Used to be exciting.
Something is going on with AJ, he doesn't seem to be enjoying himself anymore. Its like he is boxing for $$ not the love and passion ever since the Ruiz fight. 💯 He needs to stay with Derrick James.
Boring
Poor fight.. Well done aj but u are no where near ready for fury....
A LACK LUSTERED PERFORMANCE. BOREING
I believe Joshua heart not in the ring no more.  I say he should follow his heart's desire
All the Brit’s has turned to excessive holders 😂 aj has learned from tyson the teddy bear. They can’t win without holding 90% of the fight
Imagine likes of foreman v Joshua  Juat an Efin jo seekers allowance joke
AJ it’s unbelievably stiff. Looks like a statue and not a fighter. Fury or Wilder will put him down badly. With all respect to him but he should switch disciplines to something like fitness master class or something.
I am glad I didn’t pay to see that
AJ is very slow, doesn't throw alot of punches, doesn't follow up the jab with straight right and doesn't control fight or force opponent back
AJ not the same after Ruiz definitely
Im huge fan of AJ,but after Ruiz he is not the same he is scared to throw punches to much defensive. I remember him against Whyte,Charles,Povetkin,Klitschko,he was a monster
AJ got away with a lot of punching while holding behind the head
Not one of them in Tyson Fury level 😎
AJ is Back 😆🤣 this is a joke !!! Andy ended his career he and his supporters don't want to see that...
Franklin's durability is elite ngl. Most guys woulda been gone from them right hands
AJ looked like he ate some decent hash muffins before that fight...
Only time AJ showed any aggression or anger was after the final bell he needs to retire before he gets seriously hurt
I just wasn’t impressed at all. No way he could beat a Wilder or Fury. I like AJ but I just don’t see it 🤦🏾‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🎯
There is one possibility that is in AJ's favour, and that is maybe he is better fighting guys his height or taller. He pivots his shots better when fighting taller guys, when he fights shorter guys he becomes stiff, and cannot get the pop he needs.
It’s hard to re-start his career without steroids
was like watching paint dry .....
AJ is whack…😂😂😂
Joshoua have heavy hands. I don't know why he don't move his head, he is like an easy target.
AJ affraid to throw punches, AJ affraid to throw combinations, AJ affraid of counters... AJ's legs in cement, no speed, no counters... Punch and grab for 12 rounds... Huge respect for Franklin. AJ became a champion in an era, where there were no more real HW champions and the remaining ones were only there to earn for retirement. For a short time a champion in an age of business oriented p*ssies, not fighters. That does not make him great. He just looked the role.
Like AJ but he’s gone boring to watch. I feel , I very feel.
AJ's older now, he can't compete with the younger boxers on speed so he's having to learn a different style, he's pacing himself better in order to keep his strength right to the end & finally using his long arm's & size to keep the distance between himself & the other fighter... I agree that at time's he didn't seem as slick, easy & comfortable as the "old AJ" but that's how all great fighter's have long career's Let him get comfortable with his new style & re gain his confidence, we may never see the quick feet & rapid punching of old but AJ's not a quitter & he'll deliver a style & excitement again that we'll all be happy with. Also don't forget Franklin isn't a bad fighter himself & he certainly made AJ work for the win... Praises deserved by both fighter's 👍
That was a draw
Back to boredom
No one outside of little Britain wants to see his fights. 😂
Joshua is done. Period
Why does he keep fighting bums why are boxers so scared to fight real competition
AJ , he looks scared . Why he punching like a robot . Dude acting so weird . And they're standing straight up . 😂
Even the highlights are boring.
😮‍💨🥱
Boxing is dead to me. Unlike those days of Mike Tyson, Ali, Lewis etc. The ones we have now are just jokes
I love Anthony Joshua ❤. But this fight clearly shows his confidence is gone and he lacks the skills of an elite boxer. Sorry to say our dear AJ can’t be a world Champ again.
Joshua is fighting afraid. So much lost potential. Imagine if he had a trainer like manny steward.
I love Anthony Joshua ❤. But this fight clearly shows his confidence is gone and he lacks the skills of an elite boxer. Sorry to say our dear AJ can’t be a world Champ again.
AJ doesn't fight enough, he fights once every 12-18 months, he's never going to be ring sharp like that. Fury knocks him out in 3, wilder maybe even quicker.
Anthony is not yet serious for this title simple
AJ is garbage and shouldn't be considered an elite heavyweight. He should just quite. Boxing needs Usyk vs Fury, not AJ vs Fury. Aj cannot make it against the elite. It's already been proven, he has no boxing skills and you can obviously see it in his last two fights. A real ref would of deducted points for his holding especially pulling that garbage during the Usyk fight. It's dumb how people actually find him to he an elite boxer. Sad really
Joshua look better with the help of Robert Garcia
What a flop
Next he will be fighting a mom ON HER WAY TO THE HOSPITAL .
Joshua reminded me of Frank Bruno in this fight. Which is not a compliment.
Boring AF.
Джожуа ето не боксер.Перепуганий
Joshua  jab Panch so slow , his hands were still same is not moving fast same mob
He should fight Taylor Swift  next
I dont understand how perople still pay to go watch AJ fight when all he does is just below-par boxing with no soul to it. He will always be same AJ and no publicity will make his fight interesting to me anymore.
Joshua looks terrible one tap to the temple from being stopped that's why he not letting hands go
not enought to chalenge usyk.. sorry🙏
Aj is just not an entertaining fight
Franklin only had to land one decent shot back on Joshua and would had been wobbling round the ring 😅😅😅😅😅
Joshua is trying to move his head.  Trying.
13:29 - He looks like a man who won the fight, but did not beat his opponent. A soporific showing from Joshua.
What is Franklin thinking clinching so much at the end of the fight? You aren't gonna win holding bro. I get it he is probably tired but he didn't look THAT labored.
Gun shy since the ruiz defeat
Boring fight,  thank goodness it wasn't ppv.
Поверніть Кличків,Льюіса і Тайсона.На такий бокс неможливо дивитись
Big Frazer would knockout Franklin in 6 rounds
AJ looked great in that fight. Him and Wilder would be an amazing fight.
What's this?😂😂This ain't real boxing..
Caution is very wise after getting caught by Ruiz who despite his appearance is like a viper. It is a sensible move to play it cautious as a knock out by Frankling would have meant a career end for AJ. As for the strategy it was the same as that used by Usyk and everyone was saying how great he was. AJ has had to dig deep to get back. As for attacking, Klitschko was boxing the same style. I would like to see knockouts but it can be about getting the job done picking up the least damage. If it would have been a two round knockout all the pundits would have been questioning whether he can go the distance. So no chance of winning where the media is concerned. “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” ― Theodore Roosevelt  Great work AJ!
11:18 - Joshua should have been doing this the entire night. I am not impressed with Joshua's performance. He looked rigid. His punches did not flow. He looked cautious and -- at times -- disinterested.
I honestly would like to see Josh train with Usyk. The man looks as fit as ever.
AJ is still trying to use his right hand to stop a jab that was not going be thrown rather than waiting and slip and be able to throw his right hand over the the jab he made that error against Usyk multiple times and payed for it
AJ ist überbewertet!
AJ is washed! He's also too scared to fight a formidable opponent!
Mans fighting bums. Get in the ring with Wilder or Fury.
Number 1 on trending. You have successfully passed MrBeast. Congratulations.
2 big africans
The big problem with aj is ever since the ruiz defeat he looks like is always 1 decent punch away from defeat
He looked pretty average against a nobody !
Ojjj słabiutka ta walka ,bez emocji w ogóle ,jakby chłopa nie było .Nie wróży to dalszej świetlanej kariery ,zgasła iskra którą miał.
Joshua does looks like he daren't let his punches go for fear of getting rocked. He'll never be champion again as long as Fury and Usyk are around.
Frank brono the second but only Frank was better
Aj looked as though he didnt want to be in the bee ring. Bad day at the office
Why did he pick such a little dude?
A bit more agresion needed by Joshua, I'm sure it will come in time.
Amateur boxing level!!!
Joshua is far too static, you can see why USYK made him look ordinary, he’s definitely scared of getting hit. He will never be a world champ again.
Garbage
Glad I don’t subscribe to DAZN with this poor commentary and camera work
Wilder would have knocked both of these guys out in the same night....
Fell asleep watching this
Joshua's not ready for Fury
AJ will lose to Wilder and no point him fighting Fury as it will be Fury 12 rounds to 1 maybe 2.
What a boring fight, AJ had better stay away from the the big boys with a display like that.
Well I'm glad I didn't buy this
Joshua vey Bruno-esqe! Stiff, heavy footed no rhythm.
Reminds me of Frank Bruno, loved, but not that great.
AJ should use the double jab more often. Decent fight 👏
Being completely impartial and totally honest...this was a boring fight.
'Highlights' is a bold choice of word.
Thought that was herb dean for a sec 😂
Joshua with another lack luster fight! 😅
Was more impressed by Franklin to be fair.
😴💤
The wooden top is back.
I think Joshua was watching too many creed movies.
aj is back loooooool
Highlights?
Never even knew this fight happened
Joshua doesn’t let his hands go
If AJ goes 12 with the likes of this then he will be an undercard for along time.......
Ruiz knocked the balls right out of him. Fury would be a long night for him.
Хороший парень , но великим чемпионом не станет.
Could put 2 AJ's in at once against Fury, and he'd annihilate the pair of them 😂😂  Second third time Fury see him flat footed and square he'd get knocked out....wouldn't go 3.  ....lastly AJ is NOT in any way shape or form a heavy puncher. Franklin doesn't even look like he's been in a fight.
A.Joshua A.Ruiz və A.Usykdən sonra elə bil qorxur, əvvəlki kimi ürəkli deyil. D. Wilder və T. Fury onu asanlıqla məğlub edəcək...
Кличко порівняно з цими боксерами просто феєрверк😂
Je me demande toujours comment les fans de joshua peuvent-ils penser qu’il peut battre Fury ? Tyson fury est 3 niveau au dessus de joshua il va littéralement l’anéantir sur le ring
Schwacher Kampf von Joshua,  wegen solch vorausgesuchten Gegnern ist das Boxen im Vergleich zur ufc nix mehr.  Warum nicht gegen fury ,wilder...
Well - there were two bellies in the ring bigger than mine! Clearly, AJ should have been able to finish this bout before the 12th!  I have always thought that holding the 1212  Olympics in London favoured Joshua over his Italian opponent. With the money he must have accrued, I would advise Joshua to retire - there is much more competent competition out there - beware! Regards from Blighty :)
AJ a insult to boxing the most overated boxer In  the world and as boring as paint drying I hope he retires now.
He's still too static and afraid to engage. His first fight with Ruiz ended him I reckon. He'd be battered by Fury or Wilder.
I've seen worse fights. This was a tune up fight for him.
He needed to make a statement and put on a clinic. Is this what we just witnessed?
Shocking AJ couldn't beat a fighter that isn't even top 30...Usyk gave him a masterclass in boxing. Tyson Fury will retire him.
Wilder  would end Joshua
Let’s be honest guys Frankline won this fight🤦🏽‍♂️
It's more like fencing boredom set at round 3 for me.
Boring
Franklin was throwing hugs more than jabs
hugging fight
Pukey Dukey Franklin ko in last two fights
Anthony klinczko😂
Joshua sebenarnya kuat di pukulan jet 2 dan pertahanan..tp blum maksimal.. Utk franklin..dia postur kurang tinggi....dan harus belajar spt tinjunya sang legend mike tyson....salam olah raga
If we’re just going off of highlights, Franklin beat Joshua
AJ gone in the bussiness
This is Franklin, can you imagine who would really put this clown to bed,Joshua hasn't got That instintced anymore...did he ever have it ...?
well done aj was quite a difficult fight
Anthony lacks agression..must retire and join the fake wwe wrestling crowd..ex joshua fan.
Jesus, what's up with all the blood!
Sorry but he fight 1 time a year there no way you can build skill or get better with 1 fight a year tyson said it him self. Boxing has gone down because of the promoters are money hungry idiots.
👍👍👍
AJ just looks so square-on at times, just making a bigger target. Its basics. Dont get it. Also, you would believe he was just getting over an injured right hand the way he didnt use it.
Joshua has become a very boring fighter..franklin fought a better fight.
Joshua is just a pretty face in boxing! Not impressed!😂🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
AJ has sworn  to retire with his brain cells intact. Smart move.
I always supported AJ, I hope I'm.wrong I really do, I think Aj,s head is not fit for boxing. If it goes anything other than what he expects, he can't understand why. Very disappointed in him with Franklin, no boxing from AJ, he looked flat, spent more time in each others arms,. No way he can beat ysek or fury with a performance like last night. SORRY AJ, I DID THINK YOU WERE A STAR.
Prime Mike Tyson would have annihilate these two in the 1st round.
Another horror show from the boxing world   When will someone sort this out
Joshua: All that muscle for nothin
I'd like to see joshua v whyte 2. Then put parker vs Franklin on the undercard
No no no, stay on the senofobik side FBA people(deliberately spelt wrongly otherwise youtube detects & deletes the comment). You & Tariqa Nagrift have already shown us your true colors & there is no coming back to blaq diaspora. We still tune in just in hopes that we hear you've been located & taken out. You've created an unstoppable avalanche of 8te to the point my own kind asks me, "where am I from?", same question a staunch ❄  supremacist from the south would ask. Do not for a minute compare yourself to the likes of the scholars you mentioned as they won't touch you or Tariqa Nagreed with a 15foot long pole. I won't forgive you for what you've done and I know most of us diasporans won't either. So, stop trying to ease your way back with the lil message, it's too late. 8te was in fashion soon as Zaddy I mean, Trump took office and now it seems as it it's drying out so, now you want to ease your way back? I know you've seen videos where your leader Tariqa was encouraging his FBA minions to 🔫 "tethers". You think that's fixable? 😂 😝 😂
I think AJ should stop boxing,
Very poor fight
He needs to fight wilder next.
Boring fight.. AJ looks worried in there now like he's scared of his own chin.
Yawn...
I have no idea why so many people would be willing to pay to watch AJ box nevermind finding there way to a stadium packed with people. And I'm a boxing fan.
Wth is wrong with aj these days? Stands in one place slow punches fells like he’s sleeping
Joshua not the same fighter he used to be.
Jhosua losser😢😂
I think AJ just mainly jab Jermaine's head off. It's like he's not really interested in a shoot out. Maybe coz he's not motivated enough for this since there's no belt involved but what I saw here is that this fight didn't give him the motivation to engage
He looks nothing like the fighter he was before his previous losses.  However,  he still has the tendency to keep his chin up in his fights, which his coach should have worked with him to fix.  Especially since that weak spot is the target every one of his opponents will seek to exploit.
Ya le hacía falta una victoria se vio con buena esgrima
It’s all right calling out Tyson but grow some balls and get in the ring with him 🥱🥱
Big dosser lost his aggression since ruiz
What a big dosser ... 🤦🏿‍♂️
AJ vs Whyte 2 for September, then Wilder vs AJ in February. That’s how it should be
Hate that DAZN commentator. Literally just shouting
Throwing punches in slow mo, please somebody save the boxing world from this nightmare!
AJ so much declined that he allowed Jer. Frank take him (AJ) to round 12. The previous AJ I used to know would have ended everything in round 5 at the latest. Any ways, congratulations to him.
Joshua finish
Aj is afraid to get hit
A.J. was programmed and played the part with robotic movements, one punch at a time. Jab was effective when it connected. Yet far too much posing, feinting, and hugging. All this, with a shorter, less lethal opponent standing right in front of him. Afraid to exchange? Probably. Overly cautious for counters, thus incessant covering and keeping his attack to one punch at a time. Fought as if he we're hoping to preserve himself for a bigger payday. And that could be his last big one, if he doesn't improve into a multi-faceted boxer, willing to let his hands go, and not relying on his opponents to initiate the action. At least, he got back in the ring, which is a lot more than we can say about some of the current champions out there
Nothing on 90s boxing… so boring these days
Notice performance from aj. He can't  Bambang with the big boys. No way
Oh dear...
AJ looked like Michael Spinks in the Tyson fight.
AJ IS A JOKE OF A BOXER
Joshua was far too cagey and cautious in the early rounds, it was like he didn’t want to hurt Franklin. That 12th round showed a bit more grunt. Hopefully he can get back to a decent level and show more of what he only gave in glimpses here.
Joshua still trying to be a boxer which is not what got him to where he was. Trying to be the boxer is what caused his decline. His boxing looked much better but he was still taking a lot of shots. Not as impressive as I'd hoped bit it's a step in the right direction I suppose.
Aj is a cheat holding the guy Franklin around the head. Aj has been hyped up all his career, he is boring to watch in the ring and to listen to. I can't understand why he has a big following for. It will be interesting to see how he gets on with wilder. I think if Franklin carried the weight he had against Whyte into this fight he would have stopped aj. Look at what happened in the two Ruiz fight's. Money now is the only reason for aj to want to fight Fury. Aj is no way near Fury's level and that fight will be completely one sided. If aj is going to continue boxing he should consider chisora, dubois, hrgovic, Zhang, Anderson, or Sanchez. Aj hasn't shown anything to suggest he deserves fighting wilder or fury he lost to usyk twice on points imagine what fury would do to him not to mention wilder
'Holder award' goes to..who just lost😂
AJ fights like a 90's video game
Everyone hating on Joshua, Franklin is no mug, very sound win and didn’t take any damage, well done Joshua
Aj should become an actor, he will never have the balls to fight wilder ir fury, better go and fight creed 4
My barber
🤦🏽‍♂️
He has no business in the ring with Fury or Wilder.
Franklin would still be getting his Vitals checked if he fought Wilder last night. AJ is DONE DONE DONE!
Joshua still has to learn how to create space on the inside to get off more punches
Comfortable night's work for AJ, against a durable coynter puncher. Bit lacking in excitement, but he came through routinely. What won't be low on excitement and action is Katie Taylor vs Chantelle Cameron, which I am buzzing for and cannot think of a more anticipated fight in the whole of boxing at the moment🥊💕
Great job! AJ
Joshua 👎👎👎👎
Is this a recent fight? Like, after he lost his mind with ushek
A j has become so weak
Boring
ive watched joshua for quite some time now and I can comfortably say this is his worst fight
I kind of feel sorry for AJ
AJ is ok but he has always been a lil too stiff, he moves flat footed which makes him slow to react and very predictable. I hope they can work more on his footwork, try make his feet lighter and he will be just fine but until then he is prone to upsets
The most boring boxer on earth. YAWN
Joshua's finished. He's too scared to engage with anyone anymore, that Ruiz defeat has done him.
If thats what AJ has to offer then Tyson furry has no worries. Just my Opinion 😊
The way AJ Carries his right hand as if it's too heavy for him. 😅   I just wish he could get back to the level he was before the Ruiz fight! Man is still not as confident as he used to be.  But I see a greatly improved stamina. But still, he has to learn to use his height and reach properly. Why does he stoop?
Joshua gets stopped by fury wilder and Joyce
AJ is still going nowhere 😅
Pathetic
Problem is with aj is he ain't gonna be world out and out champion as he hasn't got the killer instinct like holyfield or tyson
The fight that no one wanted to see
Crazy how big Joshua is and he doesn’t use his size … even worse that he’s never been the same after the first Ruiz fight … so scared to engage  Edit - ain’t no way Franklin is 6’2 … he looks 5’11 in this fight
Remember when deluded uk fans thought aj was the best heavyweight in the world 🤣🤣
AJ has to be the most flat footed heavyweight I’ve ever seen, if he added a nice loose bounce to his style he’d be so much better. He just looks so slow, not that talented. Just a body builder with a jab at this point, I don’t think he’ll ever be champion again as long as Fury and Usyk are around, it’s a massive shame.
I think AJ's lost his love for pro boxing, he looked sharp at points but didn't look like he wanted to dominate...fair enough
Fury would destroy AJ
I'm AJ's no.1 fan but to be honest he's not as skillful as Fury and Usyk.
Хуйня а не бой
AJ is broken. He would do better to retire and work on the next generation of fighters.
Joshua looks terrified of being caught, makes him seem stiff like he's overthinking doing everything not to make a mistake. He's lost the fire
Nearly everytime AJ tried to load up on him he missed  🥊🥊🤪
Ajs back he said . Lad aj is a parcel
Mediocre performance.  Seemed to lack the spark of his earlier fights.  I appreciate he possibly lacks a little confidence after his last two defeats and needs a few more fights under his belt on his comeback trail.  I believe if he and tyson fury met in the near future, fury would beat him on points rather than by KO
decent from AJ just needs more fights with derrick imo, although he is gun shy due to previous fights, however he has to let them hands go to secure the KO’s.  Also credit to franklin, his last two fights have shown he can hang in there and if does somethings differently he can for sure win many in the future.
Слишком сильно антоху распиарили
Joshua is my country man and I never thought I'd ever say this. Joshua hasn't got it in him man. Can't stand Fury nor Wilder. Joshua keeps me nervous watching his fights.
Joshua very stiff slow punches also his movements need alot of work. His jab is not fast enough. Jab and move but he just stands there
AJ has lost his fire
The highlight was the final bell
Joshua to easy to hit
Credit to Franklin, he did rough him up and made Joshua work for it. AJ should now start building his career again - needs to work on his aggression and endurance.
When was this fight
Ruiz found AJ out, he’s now so worried about what’s coming back that he’s afraid to unleash, he really struggles defensively against high volume punches, against wilder his output would be even less and he 100% loses that fight!.
congratulation to aj for this fight
It’s okay to criticize AJ but if you are a fighter indicate let’s see what you have achieved.
AJ lost his killer instinct. Seems affraid.
higjlights should be max 5 min like why 13 min its the full fight xD
Joshua couldn't dominate a standing target, he just couldn't get out of first gear.  Franklin never changed his stance of standing right in front of Joshua throughout, he was there for the taking but was contiually let off through lack of any aggresssion on Joshuas part.  Who's Joshuas next opponent? I'll wager there's a line off them on this showing.
Wow this is the best Joshua’s inside work has been. Really look forward to how his new coach will help him develop :)
I have noticed over the years that alot of black fighters can't take a big heavy head punch.
AJ looked as if his mind was in his house still . concentration looked not on the fight
DAZN the most bias commentary I've ever witnessed.
When aj fights up the scale,beware Joshua.
Yes AJ is back fighting but something still not right with him, a win is a win but didn't see much that was positive during the fight, AJ has turned into the Lion from the Wizard of OZ.
what a boring match. Joshua confidence has been rocked hard and it shows, His body is tentative and slow, and his mind is elsewhere. Now put mike tysons mind in AJs body. He would be a totally different beast. AJs is playing well below at his best.
Joshua very average
Dang.  13 minutes definitely wasn't needed for these "highlights".
Borow that's why people wants MMA
NO HES NOT!!😂😂
johshua is shot. He has no soul as a fighter right now.He is done.
Yes AJ!!!
My Mum could've beat him ..and she's 85 years old
How was he ever champ ?????
Joshua still not attacking. If you don’t go forward, you can never be a champion. Franklin hurt Joshua a lot. Joshua was 21 pounds heavier, which is a lot and Joshua is definitely super fit. Franklin was all done at the end of the 7th. Joshua still couldn’t knock him out. Joshua’s world champion days are over.
Stiff ,boxing by numbers ,foot work looked like me learning to Waltz with to left feet,jab was ponderous ,image Franklin was 3inches taller and 2 stone heavier we all know who would have won, I know AJ was ring rusty but  other than his name has little to offer,so have your big pay day against Tyson f ,and retire before you get hurt
Aj is boring 😂 should have won by knockout, bc he gave way too much film to watch for others to beat him
He has to figth Tyson Fury , otherwise he is just a Covergirl ,,,
Already I can c that AJ really worked on his biggest problem n that was turning his head n dropping his hands when he thinks he's gonna get hit . Big improvement
UZYK 2.0
UZYK
The new Audley Harrison has arrived
If Tyson isn’t going to take the difficult fight, he could do a lot worse than AJ
ref let him keep Franklin in a headlock for 12 rounds
AJ's performance  reminded me of the Marvin hagler quote ” It’s tough to get out of bed to do roadwork at 5am when you’ve been sleeping in silk pajamas” .  I know he has limited skills but where was the aggression, where was the hunger?. It was like going through the motions with the occasional realisation what he was there to do.
Was like watching Bruno again hard as nails but not fluent in his punching robotic too much muscle.People think they need massive mussels to be a fighter but in fact it works against them
AJ is only half the boxer he was before he lost to Andy Ruiz, I watched the lead-up to that fight he thought he had won before getting into the ring. He will never recover from that loss. He's afraid of getting hit. He could have gone all the way,  but not now he will try but not succeed, he's finished.
Overly cautious, flat footed, no head movement, slow and plodding. Barely a punch thrown with bad intentions. Dire performance from Joshua. Said it before and I'll say it again, Bruno woulda knocked him out.
Big up Aj make a brother eat
Joshua was not impressive at all   in my opinion . They both looked slow and were afraid to throw a punch
I'll give him the respect he deserves as it's a comeback fight and he's got his demons to deal with and all that after his losses, but fury would absolutely savage AJ at any point in his career from now onwards.
They ended the fight 6 seconds to early, look when the timer disappears and stip the time by yourself
This is not boxing. If I want to watch a boxing-match I check out old footage of Mike Tyson for example.
Ruiz really ruined this guy huh
AJ too flat footed and same moves, only advantage he's fast with his shots
AJ didnt look like a fighter in there he looked like a supreme athlete in a boxing match. big difference.
AJ will run around first round with fury to avoid knockout!
I don't think he is even in the top 5 of his division. The hype is over.
Joshua said he's knocking him out 😂still waiting Franklin v joshua 2 Franklin's winning just needs to train oppersite possition now he knows what' Joshua got if he was a little taller he would of landed more of them shots agree???
aj looked stiff and slow didn't even try to turn over his right hand! best thing he can do is call it a day
Congrats for the W, but why did AJ show the fighting spirit when the final bell rang where was that aggression during the 12 rounds!? 🤷‍♂️
Awful fight actually, his last 5 fights have been poor
0:19 “let’s go to work”   I love how each referee have there on little nuances but this one is cold 👌
Does Joshua remind anyone else of frank bruno?
Who? 😂
Joshua is one of biggest frauds of all time
Going off of the Franklin fight? Nobody! For real, I dunno how this kid was ever a champion, everyone begging for Wilder, Wilder would sleep this character!  Fury is just to much for AJ, he knows he is done though, he just wants that last big payday!
really you lot should shut up. AJ is not even washed up. he never was anything look at him box now all that experience and looks like a amateur.
that guy joshua is sorry PERIOD
Why am I keep hearing Tony Yayo's voice in the background? 😂
AJ looks like a shell of his former self
Boring fight
Joshua can do better.
Joshua is finished. Honestly I'd rather pay to watch jake Paul than this washed up sore loser
I for sure see improvement from AJ snapper shots at times, better stamina but slow with his jab. And Franklin is pretty fast and agile for a heavy weight and a decent fighter
Better from AJ but Franklin is no mug well done both fighters
Aj so overrated
9:26 You can't hold your opponent and hit him at the same time..come on ref!
DECENT HUGGER
Joshuas footwork is robotic.
Je dirais pas is back
As plodding as Frankenstein’s monster. Fury makes him look like a fool with his movement. Even Wilder with his terrible boxing skills kills AJ. He’s over as a top tier boxer..
Joshua is a cupcake.
AJ is done...Deontay will KO him, Miller would batter him, Fury would toybox him...boring, slow and clumsy...it is what it is.
AJ has never beat a top level fighter and have lost to second level fighter. He would be easy work for Fury or Wilder
Aj needs to retire
Same lumbering boring style with zero head movement and no combinations. Hes still scared to be hit
I need to see more jabs from AJ.
DAZN stretching the definition of the term highlights with this one as it was plop💩
Что было бы с учетом если бы Антонио так боксировал с усиком
Aj never recovered from lost with Andy. It looks for me that he lost his spark. This match seems more like a diplomatic lunch instead of a boxing contest. 12 rounds I was waiting n  wishing for AJ to deliver his lovely KO but none so I am a bit disappointed. Just out of record I m 100% sure AJ was way better n danger in his earlier career
Credit to Derek James. Anthony, Joshua timing looked a lot better and his technique. His boxing IQ was on display. I think Derek James will be able to get Anthony Joshua back to where he was.
wilder would knock him out in two rounds
This is bad... AJ won this but his boxing is not enough for top to take the belts and stuff.. He is stiff slow in movement and etc..  He wluld have problems with someone like Hrgovic or Zhang...
Am still not convinced AJ is ready to withstand Fury?
Joshua is ready  Let’s put him with another tiny guy
AJ deserves the credit.  This is heavyweight champion
miał dużo szczęścia na początku  w walce kliczko ale potem grubas złamał jego pewność siebie a usyk pozbawił go wiary w swoja umiejętności w tej chwili to mentalnie wypalony sportowiec
Absolute snooze fest, if I had paid for this I would have been annoyed!
Joshua is slow
AJ is back 🤣 Yeah right …. 🤪
That was one boring fight. Both fighters get a C- grade.
Hope AJ will be faster next time or will all in early.
Has anyone got highlights of the highlights??
Well done AJ , but you look a shadow of yourself. 5 years ago you would have walked through him. Get back with Rob McCracken who actually cared about you and in no time you will be back to your best.
Don't could be only my impression. Joshua it does boxing but looks scared to me. It's not the same guy. Fury or Wilder will destroy him without any problems
Very boring
This fight is bloody congrats AJ my Gee
Was an initial fan of AJ, but his lackluster performances and lack of desire to fight the top guys has worn thin on me.  This guy can't  even dispense of a for lack of a better word, a journeyman  is embarrassing... It's over Rock,as Mickey once said to Rocky Balboa
Thats bull should of been s draw ...
Hasbula
Fierce, bloody and nice coming back. Kudos AJ.
Why does this say aj is back, from where, and doing what. Or was it ment to say backward 😅😅😅
how have you got 13 minutes of highlights from that fight? the highlight was the little scuffle at the end, AJ was rocked a few times, may be he knows he hasn't got the heart or the chin. I was pretty disappointed with his performance
Ai did very well,more cautious, accurate jabs,better footwork and concentration for winning not just knocking out Acceptable performance after two defeats.💪
Combat nul
Not taking anything away from Franklin here, he did well and is better than we all thought. But AJ can’t hang at the top of the sport anymore.
This is the ring magazine hug of the year. Boring AF
Джошуа нудный. Франклин был по интереснее
One of the worse fights I've seen in my opinion...disappointing
AJ's recent performances in the ring have shown hesitancy and conservatism, which may stem from the deep hurt he suffered from defeats by Ruiz and Usyk. Subconsciously, he may fear being knocked down or facing another defeat. While his latest fight was solid, it lacked the boldness and aggression of his previous bouts. However, one positive takeaway from the fight was his resilience and strong chin, as he absorbed several powerful shots without showing any visible effects. Nonetheless, as he ages, it's important to remember that his glory days may have come and gone, a realization that is ironic given his past match against Klitch. Time flies by quickly, and AJ must now find a way to rebuild his confidence and adapt to the changes that come with age.
Yea 😂
Static target to throw the jab at. Usyk changes angle, AJ can’t box against that and can’t take being smothered either. Will never be a champion again
Franklin he tried to hold Joshua till last minutes
Back…is a bit strong
my mother ..98.... is stronger than Jarmaine Franklin !!!! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Truth is wilder or fury or usyk would beat him.
AJ = OVERRATED
Es un tamal para el rey de los gitanos
DAZN AJ is back 😂😂😂😂
im gonna turn this on when i need to fall asleep
AJ is done
Josuha efsuslar olsun ki bedeninin aqirliqina hakim ola bilmir oz aqirliqin dasiya bilmir
Learnt nothing from that fight, the guy offered no real threat, AJ showed nothing special.
Aj is done. Retire
Joshua will not be a match to wilder
Not action packed. More defensive
Joshua was predictable.  Needs to demonstrate higher level skill to regain his no1 status.
AJ was boring to watch and looks like a rabbit in the headlights most of the time, I think the pressure has become too much I think he needs another steady fight of two before thinking of the bigger fights on offer? Fury, wilder and Joyce will beat AJ in his current state.
Falta aqueles nocauteadores dos anos 90 ,falta fome de vencer ,falta aquela garra ,Desculpa mas até o nosso Maguila tinha mais vontade de mandar seus oponentes pra lona.
AJ  lost him passion to boxing , feel sorry for him
AJ is back???? lol not at that level of the game.
What is up with Joshua not moving his head? All the fights he lost was due to him fighting to straight up and being predictable. He needs to work on his head movement & get a little aggressive.
AJ is not back . Rabbit in the headlights performance . If that is impressive Im an Orca
Hope he gained his confidence back I would’ve loved to see him more relaxed and let em go more comfortably
AJ ONLY FIGHTS WITH BUMS, GYM HIM THE SOLID FIGHTERS
Thought Franklin beat Bruno there
AJ is no threat to any boxer... 😅😅
Only shop in black man’s shops
Seen better fights outside a chippy.... no wonder Tyson Fury won't fight these bums....
Someone isnt “back” if they always lose to big names and finally wins with a smaller fight 😂. He only has UK hype
Franklin vs chisora
Aj would get his head knocked from his body if he fights wilder. And he woukd get humiliated by tyson so he is just a hype  at leat he was a hype lol
Franklin wasn’t trying to get knocked out, Franklin kept clinching when he felt that AJ was at a moment of knocking him out
Never seen these YouTubers before ?! How’d they get a boxing match man!!’v??&
Tyson and wilder gone beat Jousha if he boxes like this being to careful I think . He gone have to let em go early to get up On the cards
AJ does not move side to side, he's a sitting duck imo very minimal head movement, fury would absolutely obliterate him.
AJ IS BACK FIGHTING NO BODIES IN LONDON.
dont seem to be a fight
If Wladimir Klitschko and Frank Bruno had a child together you'd pretty much get this version of AJ and it's sad to see.    No fluidity, one dimensional, terrified of taking a punch and hesitant throughout, not to mention the constant clinching which totally ruins boxing for me.  Respect to both guys for putting it all on the line, but this wasn't top tier heavyweight action.
Is it me or AJ just look like its not him in this fight, like he was scared too throw a punch to get countered like at 6:02 he wasnt even trying to hit Jermaine or make him feint and he looks so stiff here, obviously perfecting the basics is what makes u a great fighter, but this almost looks too basic, idk im not hating, i like AJ as a boxer dude is great but this fight just felt weird too watch😅😢
I don't see how this makes Joshua back. Terrible, boring fight with nothing from Joshua. He's a shadow of his former self IMHO. Go watch Joyce vs. Parker and see how a big man uses his strength to box and dominate. Joshua is a mouse not a man....
Joshua is Nervous and To Cautious He doesn’t Want to see Deontay Wilder at alll he’s a Shot Fighter
Never heard this fight was happening😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yeah just confirmed aj is spent he ain’t no boxer
that was a beautiful fight from joshua, beautiful boxing from big josh , he will be champ again.
Joshua reminds me of Frank Bruno, great physique but much too tentative in the ring.  You’re not going to beat the best if you don’t take it to them.
Understandable for him not to look great in this fight after losses and time off but he really looks nervous pushing the jab deliberately short as a keep-away. He landed a few decent punches but its clearly mental and not physical.
Boring AJ
He doesn’t want none of Wilder Deontay wil KO AJ
Watching AJ now compared to AJ when he fought Klitschko is like watching 2 different men. Stiff, slow, scared to let his hands go. Ruiz changed him.
Does Joshua have something against ducking, bobbing and weaving? He doesn't do much of it!!!
Looks like Joshua is afraid to get hit. Still give him a chance against Wilder, way more stout than Wilder.  Its his mgt. team that seem to be afraid of Wilder. It would be a big time fight.
Серия боев с А. Усиком надломили Джошуа психологически. Куда-то делся его нокаутирующий удар Только вера в свои  силы вернет парня на вершину
He won't last five rounds against Fury.
Boring fight
The less the better
I like the way Franklin fought and carried himself. Was still aggressive and throwing very powerful and dangerous shots throughout. Never allowed himself to look totally defeated.
Joshua snooze fest
Was like watching paint dry
Aj lacks agression
😴 😴😴😴😴
AJ is finished
AJ is not back. He just fought C level opposition. AJ is still afraid of getting hit, flat footed, and has poor conditioning. He also doesn’t move his upper body as well as he should considering his physique.
What are they teaching AJ? He has no foot or head movement, no plan B, he is so limited, and people say he couid have beat iron Mike, Mike wouid have hospitalised him in a round.
Fury would smoke AJ
This is a boring fight
Decent tune-up fight for AJ. I do think though, if he performed like that against Fury, he would soundly beat. He's movement is nothing like Furys. AJ reminds me of a handheld punching toy puppet 😂
It's weird to see aj in everlast gloves it always either rivals or grants.
Joshua is trying to be a lightweight hit and move when his size should be KO in 2 rounds like his earlier days that’s we’re he’s gone wrong in my opinion.
Nothing as really changed since he was defeated.  He's not ready for a big fight yet. Watch out gervonta Davis & Ryan Garcia. That's boxing.
It's lazy dis tym Didn't expect such fight
Looks like Frank Bruno on a bad night !
Anthony Joshua is just like Tyson Fury! Two big men who fight like cowards until the much smaller guy fades! Nothing special about that.
when did it become legal to hold someone by the neck while punching?
AJ should do an rematch with that Ukrainian guy. Mike Tyson should train AJ.
Looks timid! Scared to throw any combinations and so became slow with it. Didn’t look the hungry fighter I was expecting in this one.  I like AJ but watching this I don’t think he’s really up there at all.
AJ now fights like amateur, no more aggressive, not swift in his jabbing and punching, he doesn't even fight like he has confidence.   He need to retire from boxing.
Aj has no footwork,no head movement he is slow n stiff...boring...he can't outbox Andy Ruiz,fury,wilder,uysk...he needs some pointers from Mayweather and Mike tyson😂
Another fat opponent. This guy doesn't know how to PROGRESS, only how to fall back to those he can beat.
I like AJ but wilder or  furys kills him
I fell asleep during these "highlights" jfc
I don’t think that performance is gonna worry the top heavyweights
He wasn't that bad that guy Franklin
Joshua is not back. This is just him. He's not a great boxer. He will not be remembered
After the fight in the interview aj said he would fight tyson fury after that fight I don't think  he is in the same league as the gypsy king  tyson would end his career if he fights him
The way Franklin fought it would be difficult for any neat boxer like AJ to record a TKO. He was always trying to grab and hold AJ to avoid  receiving heavy punches that could result to a KO against him. But for experience and fitness, Joshua could have lost.
Joshua is the most unathletic black dude I've ever seen. 😂
Gym bunny.
Boring fight
For Joshua to fight Fury he will need more than this performance. But first I would like to see the fight between Fury and Usky. A.J is not ready yet for any title belts.
Could have easily cut this down to under 3 mins
Gratulation er kann noch gegen kleine dicke gewinnen 😂😂😂😂
In order to have a highlights reel, the fight needs to have highlights. Someone close to AJ, please convince him to retire 🥱😴😪💤
Yosua debe retirarse
Joshua - you the best but you have to believie in it and you shouldn't be so passive. Go ahead and with your physical and mental advatage will be a winner in every battle! Believe in it!!!
still not showing much . Not enough agresivnes
Aj mid tier fs
Fury will marmalise him
Joshua ra đòn uy lực nhưng tay phải ra ít đòn quá và có vẻ thân hình hơi cứng thiếu mềm mại uyển chuyển
AJ fights are Boring AF 🥱
A.J. Joshua is totally overrated. Winning on points against a man who isn't in the TOP 30 in the world rankings with physical advantages like size and reach is just ridiculous. He doesn't belong in the TOP 5 in the world. Lost twice to Uysk, lost to Ruiz. He gets a beating like never before against Tyson Fury, and he doesn't stand a chance against Wilder either. He's a better fairground boxer.
Let's go champion
Fighting like klitschko 🤣🤣
Before I started, I told myself, if it's not a knockout, there's no point. Lo and behold, there's no point. AJ is never the same again.
AJ is back? Yeah, back to the fraudulent imposter we all know. He's done..even Stevie wonder could see that a while back.
What a bag of nails
Unless Franklin is a much better fighter than he looks, Anthony can't be to impressed with this victory.
TDK ada petinju YG dari dulu sampai skrg seperti Mike Tyson 💪💪💪
Tony bellew should be fined for those unofficial cards!!Franklin won that fight and I'm not a fan of either guy
Well to be fair, Joshua is usually great with not so great boxers
Joshua needs to fight wilder  or Ajagba
After fighting Ruiz the first time AJ has turned into a cautious fighter.
Boring
Well done AJ, great fight 👍👍
A lack lustre performance by aj, Franklin came to fight, aj needs to up his game if he's thinking of Tyson or Usyk because they'll beat him comfortably. Come on AJ!
AJ moves like a robot
Joshua defo much better..but to beat the Gypsy King? A lucky punch to floor him maybe, but Tyson gets up and well, he's just too strong..do love Anthony mind..
Wilder KO both of them same night
Franklin probably beats Dubois.
The Robot lives to fight another day
A.J. used to be someone to deal with in the boxing heavy weight world; he now looks slow and too cautious. Andy Ruiz really did a job on him.
ไอ้งั่งมวยส้วมอังกฤษ....ได้เเต่กอด ชนะได้ไงว่ะ.,.555555
Back where, after that performance he'll  not sell out a garden shed,,,There's always Christmas Pantos like our other lovable Robot big Frank bruno hecan turn to ;)
Aj  is trash now Jesus .. Franklin won that fight
AJ is washed. This fight was supposed to highlight the knockout power AJ has but he just can't pull the trigger.
this is AJ’s first fight back from 2 losses by an elite boxer so i can understand why he was a bit nervous to let his hands go in this fight but i hope he can be a better fighter the next few years
Travaille beaucoup mon ex champion surtout oublie les défaites, un peu de coriace sur le ring
AJ is only back because he beat someone different 💀
A.J, slow, frightened and timid, looks very vulnerable to a top fighter, what a shame, reminds me of Frank Bruno although that's probably a bit harsh on Frank, sorry but unless A.J can get his courage and speed back he's finished
Commentary was poor. They weren’t willing to commentate on any of franklins clean shots. Any exchange they would have the commentators would only focus on Aj’s shots
Franklin should be allowed to fashion his appearance all he wants outside the ring but inside head tails should be banned.
AJ is shot mentally. His heart is definitely not in boxing anymore.
Fire has gone out inside Anthony. Boxes like a chess player
Franklin has David Haye vibes 👀
Joshua is one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time, top five easy, no doubt about that!
AJ seems like he can't box anymore
clear loss by joshua, didnt land anything significant, got beat up
this fight was equal and very difficult for AJ. Even with this short and heavy guy , AJ don´t show the quality to beat a fighter with the same height and level as him. AJ make me laught when he call the GOAT Tyson Fury to fight with him. AJ will be humiliated and KO in the 1º round. He must be delusional if he thinks he have some possibility to win against Tyson. And i think Tyson will refuse because he don´t want to ended the AJ career. He needs to fight against Wilder and Usyk  and win with easy to fight with Tyson.
Joshua boxed beautifully 🏆
I was wondering if Joshua would have a total melt down and talk nonsense on the mic for 10 minutes while his opponent went red for him.
Another AJ fight no one will watch again.
Super
Joshua is meh
Thắng nhưng quá tệ .  lói đánh như xưa ko
Anthony Joshua moves as slower than a sloth at one moment I taught he fell asleep standing up. Slower than his punches. He may go back to training camp and practice a bit more on the paper bag
AJ is too slow and predictable. No chance against Fury
Boring they always boring fight EXCEPT MIKE TYSON FIGHT .. ITS A FACT
AJ is a male model, so cant afford to get his face marked, bless im.
Only fights I wanna see... Usky v fury and AJ v wilder
Don’t no but I’m fighting sleep after that
AJ is too much like Frank Bruno, too muscle bound, he has a glass chin like Bruno 🤣
Joshua will not beat a top ten heavyweight
joshua looks scared when he fights...not at all dominating
AJ is in a neck and neck close race with Lennox Lewis for the "most boring heavy weight fighter to watch of all time! " award!  LOL 😂 What a snoozer.
If I had AJ physique I would be a monster, with right intimidating mentality and accurate technique
AJ is back? Really 🤷‍♂️
Man AJ after Ruiz right is never same again, he was like a tank, came forward, and fight with high work rate.   Now he fight scaredly, low work rate, and shy to throw his right hand.  He better fight Fury fast before he took another L, when the fight still has money in it..
YOU CAN TELL DERRICK JAMES IS HIS TRAINER. JAB HEAVY AND DISCIPLINED. WOULD'VE LIKED TO SEE AJ LET HIS HANDS GO🙏🏿
AJ needs to go see a military psychologist and get them demons out his head and to put the tiger back defo need it.
If he sticks with Derrick James he will be that beast at the top of the division once again. Then maybe we can get that Wilder fight.
His just not the same person after losing.... I think he needs to work on his mind as if your not right in the mind your never going to fight right
LOL ! What a fake miss match LOL !  There are local men in Cornwall that would flatten AJ.
AJ IS GUN SHY  AF💯
Fighting some unknown is not a come back it was a fight
Joshua=wilder.
I had it 117-111 for anthony so the judges got it right!!!
When will these guy go against better boxers ??
Delete joshua from top 5 list. If He is realistic He will retire
Joshua is done. Way too scared, cautious, not ready to brawl. Calculating. Fury would teach him a lesson easy.  After Ruiz fight No. 1, he has never been the same. Lost his balls.
I watched and I feel like Todays Mike Tyson would Demolish AJ. His performance was average
A J should give it up. Hang up the gloves.
Franklin, wow! What a fighter, bravo!
JOSHUA LOOKS LIKE THATS LAST PLACE ON EARTH HE WAS AT
Another  mediocre performance by Joshua, its funny how the score cards doesn't reflect the fight. 117 to 111 to Joshua??? Watch the fight without the sound or hearing the commentator and you will see the difference.
Not one person commenting on here can even almost beat Franklin, couldn't even be a decent sparring partner, let alone AJ.
Give it up Joshua
The Niveau of Heavyweight boxing nowadays is so low … it hurts while watching
Joshua is done
Where is the red blood on Joshua white short coming from ?
Luta morna!
AJ was taking target practice on this guy who has no movement whatsoever ! Where did they find this guy - Whole Foods?🤔
I see a lot of comments, can anyone of y'all fight? It's not as easy as it looks. Everyone is a boxing analyst and coach now. Those guys lives are on the line in that ring.
Hang your gloves up aj you arnt the man the fighter you ones was 🤔
What a boring fight as most HW fights are these days.
Everytime AJ actually had success he then took a step back? And stiff AF.
Joshua thinks to much
Didnt even know he fought oh how far aj has fallen😂
Joshua always seems to be afraid to let his hands go
AJ appears to fight as if he is scared to get hit !? I joined the AJ bandwagon after the Olympics and enjoyed watching him unload on often poor opposition. The pinnacle was his Klitchko fight. Since then he has looked average in the ring, lacking aggression unless he can smell blood, no bounce in his legs and no snap in those massive arms. His problems are multiple. He can still knock a man out but at elite level that might not happen again.  He looks great. I'm afraid that he is the Bruno of our generation. No disrespect to either man. Like AJ says frequently for the microphone ....  'It is what it is'.
Franklin was robbed, Joshua is a over reteded boxer
He is not an elite heavyweight boxer, but is being shouted out as the best. It’s like watching big Bruno all over again.
AJ vs wilder only fight to prove if either one can continue
Franklin was the better boxer, quicker hands and feet and plenty of power. If he got himself in shape (probably means going to a lower weight class) he'd do some damage. AJ should retire before he takes some serious damage. He's not an elite boxer just a decent boxer if that.
Finally found his level I see
Modern day boxing is an L
Joshua beating Fury. Heard it here first
What a waste of money, he's has his warm-up now fight wilder or Joe Joyce
AJ fought really bad. He wouldn't stand a chance against Fury or Wilder
AJ will never fight Wilder lol.
Wilder would be the obvious matchup.   But, I think AJ loses that one.
I’m sorry, but these guys would both get starched by basically all of the top 15 or so fighters from the 80’s and 90’s.
AJ has to find the inner Tyson within him and combine it with this cautious boxing approach
Boxing has become joke these days. It's just high paid sparring.
I’ve theses are highlights glad I never paid for it
Guess Franklins fight camp was at butlins.
AJ this was a respectful win after losing twice to Usyk hopefully he can rebuild his viciousness
The hypes over. 3 losses in 30 fights says it all.
never seen a champ fall this quick.. even pacquiao who got knocked tf out still came back stronger..
Joshua needs to go train with Anne Wolfe
Nic ciekawego nabrał  mięśni ale nie skorzystał z nich  lepiej walczył z kliczko
Unpolished he needs to work on his jab...  If he leads more with that he'll improve a lot....
yea hes really back yea. cant wait to see him fight again, so exciting 😴
Still an L for Joshua.
Never heard of the person he was fighting 💀
Müll
WHY JOSHUA IS SO SLOW
Why is Joshua so stiff??
Joshua has lost it
Anthony joshua Will be remembered for generation😢
I was expecting better from Joshua😴😴😴.. Franklin impressed me though
We want another Mike Tyson!
both bad
AJ should fight Wilder
Was there a fight... shocking standard of boxing these days, more like come dancing
Wilder will knocked AJ out cold
Joshua looking like Frank Bruno here. Wooden.
Zzzzz
A decent fight for tea time.. To much pudding and cup cake, I'm sleppy
Trận đánh không hấp dẫn
Joshua fades with the big fights!!Glass  Joe from Mike Tyson punch 🥊 out 🤷🏽‍♂️
AJ doesnt look like the same fighter.  He clearly won this fight but ate some combos and couldn't KO the #34 ranked world heavyweight....Joyce would eat him alive
dubious victory.
JA puts in no body work at all. Strictly head hunting then add in he has a suspect chin. He has the look the size maybe even has the skill but something is a miss. He looks like he fighting not to get knocked out. Seems like he threw more punches before he got stopped.
Safe to say that Joshua is shot. The Ruiz and Usyk defeats really took alot out of him and destroyed his confidence.
we got a next fooled boxing became a fake sport
Okay fight. But AJ shouldn't have went 12 rounds with a no name...
literallly a free w
Okay I like what I see he approving
Glass jaw AJ knows the games up. There ain't a decent heavyweight left apart from Usyk who for me is a  cruiserweight.
He always looks like he’s about to burst into tears in the corner. I honestly think he’s got mental issues
Too much holding behind the head from Anthony
Aj is the most overrated boxer ever he’s boring just retire
Joshua was at hgis best when he was fighting regularly. Hes not the type of fighter that can fight once a year and perform. He should fight 3 times a year to improve.
AJ would get knocked out inside 4 rounds by Fury or Wilder, could see the fear in his eyes in this fight, he's finished as a serious contender.
Great performance by Aj
Franklin was just busy hugging AJ. I guess that is a strategy that was learnt during camp to always hug the bigger man. That being said, AJ isn't ready for a Fury or Wilder fight. This isn't a comfortable win. Wilder's comeback was brutal. Fury hasn't lost any fight. This AJ cannot win any of these champs.
I wanna see him and wilder
Love to see him get battered by Tyson …I really can’t stand the man
Suitable for 16 and Up? 😂  You got kids doing amateur since like 11 😂
I don't like the end of the 11th round it looked like a cheap shot and yes I know the rule is to protect yourself at all time but the ref called for a clean break
👎🏻😴😴😴😴😴😴
AJ's endurance has definitely improved, I'm just not too sure if that was hesitancy or worry that was holding him back. He's definitely a challenge for Fury, AJ's best performances have been against bigger fighters and he definitely dealt with Klitschko a lot better than Fury did. At the end of the day if Douglas can beat Mike Tyson, Rahman beat Lewis and Spinkd beat Ali, then there's no real reason why AJ can't beat Fury.
Froch said ruiz took a piece of aj s soul  Hes not the same
You no the sad thing about the fight ,i could not book it with out a subscription ,and now im wacthing on the net ,with sky i could of just booked it
If that’s Franklin from gta he supposed to be stomping the 💩 out of Joshua 😂🤣
AJ will never be top dog.
AJ seperti baru belajar tinju.
AJ have a great jab for a heavyweight but he have no real power for a heavyweight
Another can smasher.
Que paqueton es el Joshua que boxeo mas malo
Anthony has the power to ko anyone! But has bad anxiety about letting them hands go. Hopefully he can get that mental block behind him soon
Anthony Joshua the power puncher...
He looked average against an average opponent
Aj is irrelevant now
AJ💪💪💪😎
It’s like watching paint dry, AJ should hang his gloves up now, if he comes up against anyone with a heart for a fight they will make him look ordinary.  Hope he enjoys the money he’s made.
I love AJ, but he looks sooo stiff.. He needs to faint shots, and move his top body a lot more than what he is.
What happened to usyk?  Does he even box anymore?  This is why boxing is dead, unless fury fights usyk for undisputed then I swear I will never watch those promotions again
Why didn't you show the handbags at the end? lol most exiting bit
joshua the small guy killer 😂😂😂
I feel like AJ looked stiff.. and that's what causing him to lose.
AJ is back ? Ha ha ha - he is just a lucky guy
Next AJ must fight Tyson Fury. Tyson fury will finish AJ within 6 rounds for sure
Joshua Always seems to be holding back, he is never aggressive enough! He fights scared it seems, I like Joshua a lot but he always leaves me feeling like he could have done more. going the distance with a guy like this is no great accomplishment. He needs to be more aggressive more offensive.
Nice fight to my favorite 💪👊
Feeding Joshua
Those scores were way off smh should’ve only won by maybe 2 rounds
Антоха!!!    Поздравляю!!!   с   Победой!!!    Украинцы!!!    Верят!    в   Тебя!!!    -    ЖМУ - 5 !!!
Let’s face it…the biggest highlight in that fight was after the bell when it nearly kicked off. Really poor performance in that right for me. It was like watching a Lawrence Okolie fight 😳
Boring go watch MMA
Wilder cremates AJ easily and Fury just batters him to a stoppage
AJ. He needs strong heart to become waror
Joshua is not a boxer. Hes a big stiff bodybuilder. He needs to go forward and look for big shots, thats the only style for him.
this not AJ style, i think he need to do is thing in is own style and enjoy him self , cos i see lots of opportunities.   to end the fight earlier
AJ cannot stand Joe Frazier with his style of fighting. Heavyweights punch not protecting. All the old heavyweights would have thought him a lesson
Watching this again this was decent from aj with that 250lbs. It was a masterpiece what’s the hate about the ko
Aj done
This fight was so boring
I had Wilder winning all the way round 7
Congrats, but I'm not satisfied you are meant to beat Franklin not in unanimous  .
AJ had this guy teed up from the 3rd round on, but couldn't finish him.  AJ doesn't have it.
Some unbelievable comments on here Joshua is bang average  Fury Wilder & Joyce all easily beat him He looks scared to throw flurries of punches Never rated him beat no one really
AJ fights scared now. He's totally gunshy
boring fight
He needs to go back to Garica. Anyhow he needs to change his trainer. Because clearly what he has tried newly at this match is just non sense
AJ you need more work to bring back your old confidence like mikel tyson
The ref let AJ hold the back of Franklin head the entire fight
12 rounds will do hom well be better next time
Bro I’m just saying that it’s more clear than ever Aj really hasn’t been the same after the Andy loss and Usyk  It seems as though not that he is afraid of getting KOd but he looks like he is anticipating it to happen and like Mike Tyson said to Ryan “the anticipation of getting hit is worse than the hit itself “ and because of that Aj doesn’t punch with confidence or commitment like he did even we he fought Andy the first time like even when he was knocked down he still let his combinations go but now he just seems so stiff and hesitant. Wilder Will KO Aj because Wilder at least let’s his hands fly
I don't think Joshua will ever be champion again unfortunately. Not while Usyk or Fury hold the belts. He hasn't got much boxing iq to take on those guys.
AJs back as bad as ever
AJ has been scared ever since being knocked out by Ruiz. His career is done
Joshua is still as stiff as a rockem sockem robot. He’s not a true boxer, just a big athlete
I didn't want to admit it, even after AJ v Usyk 2, but after seeing this fight it cant be denied that AJ is washed.
I can't see AJ beating Fury,he has lost his aggression.He needs another fight first to get his confidence back.
Boring
Joshua looks absolutely awful, plodding pudding….. finished
Anthony Charlo Joshua
Y
DAZN putting a 16+ age restriction on this video but there’s a 5 year old kid in the front row watching the fight 😅. Make it make sense. 😂
With what I am seeing, I am glad Tyson Fury did not fight AJ.
i mean, joshua went 12 rounds with this guy, . what makes Joshua think he gonna last 12 rounds with Fury? joshua is delusional.
It has to be steroids But why boxers from 2010-2020s looks out of shape compared to 80s-2000s fighters? Especially 90s fighters They were cut
Bias commentary 😂
Joshua should have been docked a point for holding and punching, not that it would have made much difference
Not impressed by his performance.
Joshua is absolutely emotionally instable. The last time he talked extremely cringy gibberish after the fight and this he hit his opponent in the head after fight. I'm really worried about his mental health.
The whole fight he's too stiff might as well say no combinations then looking to land one punch for the ko the whole match.. who is training the brother might as well just fight Tyson for retirement money.
Far to nice,robotic,hesitant. No killer instinct. The Mexican dropped him,hes never forgot that night.
this is just too funny to watch. seriously, who is aj fighting? he looks small, out of class. come on. boxing is a joke.
I didn’t think wow he’s back when watching this fight very hesitant and didn’t really put his foot on the gas I think this fight shows that he’s on the end track of his career
He's such a boring fighter
It amazes me any 1 wants to see any boring boxing matches anymore it's a joke,
Boring fight, Joshua can't hang with the apex fighters.
AJ call it a day you got no heart
poor....
Sorry but for me AJ is finished. Look how long he took to deal with a journey man. He's a body builder not a boxer.
AJ would get destroyed in the current state he is in. This AJ wouldnt stand a chance against Wilder or Fury. He looks like an easy target.
AJ 🐐🎉 you the best
What a dead fight
AJ is still a clinching fest king zzzz
Heavyweight fights are not the same nomore this shi was boring frfr this is disappointing
Who's the guy in the white suit with mic? Anyone have his name ?
Claressa Shields
AJ really has developed a new skill here... holding the back of his opponent's head 😂.
Wilder would absolutely destroy Joshua with one punch
Nice fight Josh. U played safe which was wose
Apprehensive and gun-shy in the first six rounds, turned it up a bit when he realised how much the out of condition Franklin had started to fade, but showed one thing with crystal clarity; he definitely isn't a title contender. Doesn't belong in the ring with Fury, and shouldn't get the payday a fight with TGK would guarantee. Probably shouldn't face Wilder, neither.
Well We did not get to see the ko we wanted but who are we to judge we not the ones in the ring, but gaiety performance by AJ he beats Franklin beyond doubt. Is like we may never get to see the dawg AJ again,  I guess a technical AJ is emerging
DAZN highlights looked like AJ didn't have it all his own way unlike the judges score cards
He is no Tyson fury.
Joshua needs real opposition not an easy ride.
Big and slow
Joshua should stick to threatening skinny students. He is more pedestrian than Bruno and there were four clear opportunities in this fight for a more technical boxer to have sparked him out.
AJ is the new FRANK BRUNO - I’m sorry to say, AJ has no fire and never will.  He’s a body builder, looks great, but thats all.
Boring fight
The scores were a joke! Franklin was not far off winning this fight. Scoring like this is why boxing is dying.
Joshua is becoming a boring fighter
AJ is back... against who?
First fight I've ever fallen asleep too.
Gutted. I was hoping AJ might have changed but he’s fighting so formulaic again. Boring and ineffectual.
I am still trying to understand what happened at around 3:44. How did this guy deliver 3 to 4 hits from his left hand in half a second? Did you see that? My electric iron doesn't even heat up that fast. I tried demonstrating it, mostly out of curiosity, but ended up taking pain pills just for trying. I didn't even complete two sluggish stretch of my hand. Sometimes I really really wish I could be like them. Will you try it too? I mean trying it quickly to see if you have what it takes. You can always take the pills quietly too. Of course I would say: Don't do this at home. LOL.
*AJ is back* to terrorize the lower tier fighters? he will never beat usyk, fury or wilder
If that’s the highlights reel from DAZN and their main stable boxer then I’m assuming the walkover decision was dodgy too. Joshua ain’t no boxer and keeps that right guard so close t9 his face because he is terrified of taking a shot. I’d like to see him in with Wilder - he will get knocked out if he doesn’t collapse with fear first.
AJ has lot of works to do on speed and aggression like Iron Mike, punch accuracy like Lewis,and little bit of head movement like Fury and strength like Holy Field. With all these improvements he stands the chance to become indisputable soon.
He gave too much respect to Franklin, looked so stiff, he had every advantage you can name but still disipointed, the reason why Eddie is pushing for that Fury fight is to get as much money out of AJ as possible and throw him away, he knows very well that AJ isn't championship level no more.
Couldn't make a statement. 😂😂
Nothing has changed in Joshua's style.Deboa,Wilder and Fury are still Dicke Brocken.
Aj needs to box….he should let go of his hands man
Wilder will spark him out
Joshua is not prepared for what wilder called do
Let's remember he is by far the bigger man. Imagine if he faced a man his own size willing to trade who had some skill? ( Not a man nearing the end of his career) Basically he lacks aggression and he is one dimensional. In the USA he is known as a protected fighter. He would not last too long against Tyson. No world class fighter would get battered like he did against Ruiz! Would Tyson or Hollyfield been beaten like that? For that exposed AJ. I was never impressed with his opponents. Simply not in the same league as the old greats.
AJ needs more aggression very one dimensional not much movement, footwork needs to be quicker bit ploddy.
AJ is shot , he is punch scared
Despite their recent losses, I still want AJ vs DW!!
Joshua is definitely not an elite level fighter anymore, and bro I'm not sure if he ever was. Idk how he defeated Klitschko, maybe he was too old already.
Too cautious and hesitant. Joshua is too talented to be this one-dimensional fighter.
0 ferociousness.. bringbackMikeTyson. looks like friends trading blows.
AJ just doesn’t have that dawg in him. He’s too nice in the ring or just lacks the aggression. I think his lack of stamina may be an issue .
Aj has devastating power to the body . He had Usyk hurt so many times to body and a couple times to head just has to learn how to step on it and capitalize on the body work he has abilities to do. Do more of it. Usyk couldn’t take much more of them . He’s a smaller dude if he would have thrown a few more of them hard shots to body he woulda fell! Easier target especially when Usyk is pretty much a cruiser weight with a chin and moves head well.
Joshua got away with holding the back of the head and hitting. .  All in all I see the adjustments derrick James made  Dallas Texas in this mug
Aj is not back, he just didn't face an elite.
IDK but this AJ the I saw today could not last 5 round to a Tyson Fury or Wilder and for sure would have loss to Ruiz again...he needs a couple of more fights before that.
The guy comes from two humiliations with Usyk… he is understandably hesitant. I think against Fury it would be more competitive as he has nothing to lose there
Personally. I didn’t like what I saw from Aj. Clearly the bigger man and has the power to match but he’s to stiff and unfortunately a bit slow.  If he hits you flush. It’s going to be a problem but for smaller and faster fighters. They take advantage of that. He reminds me a bit of that street fighter character. Zangief. Big, powerful but slow and vulnerable.
Don’t see much of a big change from Joshua, I hope he can keep up on elite stage because he’s still very easy to hit!
Clown
about time lol
Happy for the win… but AJ is predictable
AJ will never match Usyk in boxing, he needs smart aggression and punching power. Forget being able to last 12 rounds, don't put it in the hands of the judges.  That's why people are frustrated with AJ. They've seen what he can do, yet when he steps in the ring, you don't know what you're getting.  This fight didn't prove he belonged at the top.
He needs to stop lifting for hypertrophy its ovious that he cjust wants to look big he can bearly throw a 1,2 at this point he cant even throw a cross
I think joshua has an impressive physique,,, but not impressive boxing skills
If he fought most of the fight like round 10 he’d be dangerous. But I don’t see him beating fury or wilder. Shame cause he’s a cool champ
AJ needs to be wild a bit else he can’t fight Wilder
Цирк Для нный и короткий Где второй длинный? ФЬЮРИ
The former 2-time world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua looked a bit nervous for several rounds, like he was so insecure about his own weapons in the ring.  Can be said somewhat understandably considering the pressure he wears on his shoulders after his two straight defeats to the skilled champion Oleksandr Usyk. While opinions may differ, I thought it was overall a weaker performance by Joshua as he looked very hesitant at times. He could have went for the KO but played it safe and realued on winning a decision contest. I believe his confidence is low and he really could have used a knock-out victory over Jermain Franklin as a booster.  A.J seems to have regressed a bit and is now more “One Dimensional” than ever. Ever since his loss to Andy Ruiz Jr. back in 2019 he have been hesitant to let his hands go more often and seems hesitant to engage. Also I believe Usyk really did a mental number on him and that further have made Joshua regressed.  All that muscle mass Joshua have, all that power - yet so little ring aggression.  There is only one way to change this negative development for Joshua and that is simpley FIGHT ON. Joshua needs to book himself to be buissy in the ring with several more fights where he can regain his confidence in his abilities and build himself up. There is no other way for him. Joshua must stop being so selective in the ring and become more dedicated to his craft by fighting more often. 1-2 fights per year don't cut it.  He needs a year with 5 fights where he is buissy against varied styles against decent enough opposition in different locations. That would be the ticket to fix him. The rest would be up to himself and taking care of his mentality.
Boring asf 😂
Back from where😂
Joshua is finished man
Joshua hadn’t won a fight since 2020, had lost three of his last five including two in a row. First fight with new trainer who is his third trainer in three fights.  He got the win. He went 12 rounds without gassing. He took some solid shots and his chin held up. He actually showed some inside game.   So many positives. He can look spectacular next time, all he needed here was a win.
Franklin was robbed.
Franklin’s height was a problem 😂
Just Joshua fitting another nobody and making a big pay day , fan should boycott him until he puts his big boy pants on and fights guys on the same playing level !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Que se retire Joshua
Whatever happened to Joshua verses Fury? Is that never gonna happen now? 🤔 I've not really been keeping up.
Boring,two burgers fighting
I would like to see him fight his fear ….other than that no one.
Combat sports has dived deep into society's cesspool 🤮
Joshua, How to describe him, Decent guy, Not enough aggression, Incredibly powerful, Not a natural boxer.
I think he needs a sports physiologist. Still seems to lack confidence in himself
He been washed just look who he’s fighting a safe fight…mentally gone
Wilder will eat both in one night
Aj is becoming more mentally mature.
Franklin won this fight Joshua is shocking, boring fighter and Franklin hasn’t been pro long.
Joshua hits hard but his footwork needs work lol he just kind off lumbers and lurches forward 😂
AJ is only human, clearly his confidence has taken a severe knock with those Usyk defeats. He needs a couple more fights to gain confidence. I would like to see him against someone like Daniel Dubois.
To quote a very old, yet arguably relevant, film...Joshua no longer has the eye of the tiger. Occasional flashes of action, energy and brilliance but this was largely a wooden and hesitant performance. Not encouraging if you're a Joshua fan ((I'm not particularly) and one wonders whether it's to do with the big weight gain......or just older and less aggressive...we shall see.
What's wrong with Joshua's shorts 🤔
Big for nothing Franklin had him Franklin tamed him judges bias !
AJ is washed
Joshua is wasted get this yute back to Ghana
Superb win by Joshua.  👍👏 He showed the right amounts of aggression and caution, against a physically strong opponent with very fast hands, who is more than capable of punishing any careless openings.  Upwards and onwards.  🦾 😊
joshua can't box man busted his nose
AJ looks slow
AJ, he's not a top 10 fighter anymore his time is up.
He wants fury or bomber think aj be beat by either one of them needs few more fights before he takes them on Joyce be gd match up for aj
I really thought A.J. was the next up and coming great, but his skill set has NEVER progressed, and to date he hasn't fought a reputable fighter other than Andy Ruiz, who he loss too. I have very little confidence he will rise to be a true contender. Make you money A.J. and move on.
AJ looked solid against a competent opponent. He did well considering his mental fragility. His weaknesses are glaring vs strong, quick, active fighters with stamina. Avoid such fighters and he'll be ok.  However, l have zero doubt he gets smoked by Wilder or Fury tho. Against them his best attribute which is size will be nullified and he'll have to rely on skill and heart and he'll come up short against both.
AJ doesnt like getting hit.
Who is the guy with white boxer?
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Tremendous recovery from the👨🏿‍🦱American 🥊
А ви помітили, що Джошуа це Володимир Клічко номер 2?! Тільки у Володимира джеб був набагато страшніший!
A.J just never looked comfortable to me , just my opinion.
Joshua needs to retire 😅
AJ should retire
Boring, boring fight
A very poor showing from AJ...I think the two defeats against Usyk left a big mark on their physique.  He no longer has a bite and has become much too cautious and is afraid of being hit.  In the past he would have quickly knocked out such an opponent
Fallobst Gegner aj auch so unsportlich so overrated
Perception is so interesting. If this was Fury, with a dominant performance, punching and moving and never in any trouble… everyone would sing his praises. AJ deserves more credit for his performances and what he’s achieved.
Some of y'all are making a lot excuses for his bad performance against a sub par heavyweight boxer. AJ will never be the same against top contenders.
Franklin is a decent hugger
Ентоні Джо красава сила
The days of Lennox ,Bruno and tyson are sadly over
Fury should call out Joshua next
AJ is the big guy less intimidating in the heavyweight divison .
HE LOOKS SCARED TO LET LOOSE. HE'S NEEDS TO GS BACK TO THE OLD AJ AT THIS POINT
Ali's daughter would knock him out
Joshua is a cross between David price and frank bruno 😂😂
Blah blah. Unconvincing to say the least. Fury is a gobshite, but he doesn’t need this match. He’d walk it anyway
What a boring fight.
I've never heard of this dude. Joshua should be scared.
Está muy lento con ese peso. Tiene que rebajar. Me refiero a josua, por supuesto
That's my man
Where is the old Joshua knock out artist?  He is a lot more cautious now.
Just hearing about this fight
A decent performance against a journeyman, AJ will be ok if he stays away from the likes of Fury, Joyce and Wilder, he took a fair few right hands, if he had fought any on those three he would have been knocked out.
And people think AJ beats fury 😅
if no one goes KO its a bad fight ...
Aj wouldn’t stand a chance against fury 🤦🏻‍♂️
Not having it aj should making statements out here he wasn't happy with his performance you could see it he don't want to box no more
Commentators and judges are biased. That was very close
What an utter bore fest
So much blood stains.
I'm afraid the media may love it, well of course they do because its hype and money,but anybody that's honest knows AJ is finished, he could never take a punch,and he's not a top level boxer, that's a fact.
Aj fights like he is scared to be hit. He is finished as a top heavyweight ever since fatboy mexican ruiz stopped him. wilder and fury both stop him
Joshua was holding the back of his head a lot ref never called it not once smh
Anthony's fights are still interesting, heavyweight division needs him. But it seems to me that his champion's perspectives are unlikely if Fury, Usyk, Wilder are staying in the game. He will be knocked out if he faces Deontay, considering his problem in defence. Usyk already proved everything two times. And Tyson won't leave a chance to him, Fury is more skilful, bigger and seems more confident.
2:41 thats beautiful body work slip slip inside slam slam
They really had to feed a warehouse worker to keep AJ in the big leagues
Aj looking back in his prime
Credit to both fighters, AJ was in control and we saw glimpses of his spiteful combinations, he's coming off 2 losses with a magician, anybody who slates him hasn't been in a fight 💯your going to have hesitation when there's so much riding on him but step by step we see him coming back into his own, fully behind him let's get it AJ🥊💨
White trunks, in a blood sport? Are you kidding? AJ is a shadow of his former self, he would have no chance against Fury, or Wilder.
Джошуа вже не той мнязів багато швиткості мало точності теж а вклінчі і дурак в бороду вдарити може
AJ is back until someone even half decent comes along and knocks him out again...
How did AJ let it go the full 12 - if he’s fighting like this he’s definitely not guna stand up against the big leagues right now
The most bias commentator ever
Still not impressed with AJ.
Not great Joshua has poor head and foot movement ...understand being tentative can't train into someone to naturally let their hands go..has already over achieved in his career..unlikely to get any better from here in but fairplay to him still getting in the ring
AJ will find it hard to achieve again if he keeps it decent by only jabbing and waiting for the right moment to punch than his normal  stance of going for the TKO
I think Joshua had the opportunity to KO him out but he was too hesitant, just playing safe. He needs to come out of his shell and bring the real Joshua out, he was not aggressive in the fight. Anyways it was a comfortable win for him❤
It’s over for AJ, 😅
Franklin clearly the better one,is madness that he didn't win
I think AJ is doing to much thinking and just needs to get stuck in.
Not impressed , Joshua is not a serious contender!
Hes not back yet.... until he beats rematch on Andy Ruiz, Wilder or White and Fury.
These commentators are way too bias towards Joshua. All they talk about is Joshua even when he takes shots, and not much of what Franklin is doing in this fight.
Joshua will not stand a chance against Fury
How is putting tony Bellew as the networks ringside scorer even remotely objective?😂. The guy literally works for eddie hearn.
Aj looks timid😮
🥱
Where is the killer instinct?
AJ had another stinker 🤦🏻‍♂️ desire & hunger isnt there anymore..on his day he could beat the best just now i dnt think so..still a legend 🤝
I cannot believe he didnt try and get franklin with a right uppercut on the way in hes there for the taking
He should not fight Wilder with this slow and robotic footwork.
Sorry but AJ looks so bad here I've paused after 3 rounds I can't watch anymore. Why is he so flat footed...
AJ could never beat Wilder
I think AJ should just work on stretching, bending, even yoga etc. He is just so rigid. He is strong and can box, so I think put that to the side and think outside the box. Get a gymnast in to take him through an extensive camp of limbering up then I'm sure his boxing would improve dramatically.
Think so one easy lol that guy would be the under card to a u tuber fight no footwork at all its a art boxing guy like a robot
Joshua is so flat footed. He's like George foreman minus the skill and power
My takeaways; Franklyn has no quit, a garnet chin and rose to the occasion. Anthony has improved on his boxing, his gas tank and looked to be relaxed. Props to both fighters (and all fighters) who put their health on the line for our entertainment.
Underwhelming win. Joshua just doesn't look like the same killer that was going into the Ruiz 1 fight till he got humbled. Respect to him for all his accomplishments in this sport, but I think Franklin beat Whyte in their fight. Even tho imo Whyte gave Franklin more trouble than Joshua did. Joshua won here, but I just can't see him winning a title fight unless Fury / Usyk / Wilder aren't fighting anymore.
AJ don’t look like he’s got that dog in him anymore!! Looks like he’s just barely going through the motions.
AJ is not the fearsome punching machine of the earlier part of his career. He has evolved into a cautious boxer who is afraid to fight on the inside and excessively afraid to take punches (at the expense of his own output). Yet, he remains a top fighter and fights against Wilder and Fury are worth looking forward to. Franklin is more than useful and the fact that AJ could not get the stoppage is no disappointment as he has an excellent chin.
If AJ is the same size as the other fighter he stands zero chance of winning, based on this fight. He has literally zero head movement and depends too much on leaning back or sticking his arms out trying to keep other fighter away. He is physically probaly one of the best looking heavyweights. Shame the skills just ain't there. Usyk skills with Joshua build, mind blowing.
I feel like after all these fights AJ is still tryna find his style
You can't even hear the boxes at all cuz the crowd won't shut their mouth
Seen the fight😂if he fights tyson?he's going2 get bashed up.diferent class off fighter😢
If Franklin was taller Joshua would be on the canvas.  I don't understand why they don't create a new weight class.  Super heavyweight.  Even "big" George foreman would be considered small these days.  Really shows you how special Usyk is.
AJ frustrated because frankly always hug AJ. Frankly such a bored boxer for AH
Still can't fight leaves his jab out too long gets countered with the right hand it appears he can take punched a little better. Tighten up his jab so he can set up his right hook and more body work 🤛
What is with this guy constantly fighting muscley midgets
Even skipping 99% of the video i got bored
Late rounds Joshua was literally holding his head down with one hand and uppercutting with the other and the Refs there like 👀 🤷🏻‍♂️🫣
Franklin looks really out of shape.
AJ was very flat footed for me and boxed in straight lines, that was probably the poorest performance I've seen from him, not sure where he goes from that fight, it'll be an easy nights work for Fury, Widler, Joyce etc, even Whyte after that showing. Franklin is an awkward fighter, but Joshua didn't budge him all fight.
Let’s go come back aj🥊🔥
13:43 BEST PART! 😮
Franklin got heart. I think it’s all on the way down for AJ.
AJ is in wayyyyyyy better condition than his last fight! A bit hesitant in the beginning but found his groove
Is there a heavyweight out there that has never seen a Tyson fight? Did they take nothing from it? Standing in the middle of the ring, upright, on flat feet, pushing out the odd jab is not going to win against a decent fighter! And the British fighters are the worst!!!
What a worthless fight.
Combat triste pour le tarif..
aj needed the win but Frank is solid
That was kind of boring
Which one will face KSI or Jake Paul next though?😂
Well done Anthony Joshua!!! What a great fight to watch. Joshua never got tired. Love it. He really is an athlete that doesn’t stop training. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wolni jak kupa 🙈🙉🤡
Franklin did. himself proud big step up made it difficult for AJ
That was a bit painful to watch. I predict, that if Tyson Fury doesn't knock out Joshua in the first round, it'll definitely be over by the third.
AJs hype is gone he just too soft. Somebody give him a movie contract quick
I can't see aj knocking anybody out ever again..he's the modern day Frank Bruno...retire and stop embarrassing yourself!
Anthony can't fight.
Franklins tough nice setups with the right hand an rhythm control an angles. Joshua worked on the basic an sharper technic keeping simple suits best for AJ game with his size an power strong showing by both competitors
Boxing is a funny sport. Most sports you can clearly see the standard has moved on but in boxing and especially the heavyweights, the are light years behind the greats of yesteryear. Can see it with my own eyes.
No confidence in AJ’s movement at all. Moves around like he has a pinged nerve. Experience is there, skills are there, and his strength is there. But confidence at an all time low. Hope he gains it back soon.
Happy to see AJ strong again
Bro lost his confidence. Totally different before he got lost.
Bkfc❤
AJ tak sebaik melawan Andy Ruis....lamban
That was a fckin borin match
Fury went 12 with Chisora when he could've stopped him AJ did well,not every win needs a KO/TKO
Franklyn is a tough guy
VERY DISAPPOINTING PERFORMANCE!!! DOES AJ  REALLY NEED  12 ROUND TO WIN THIS WEEK FRANKLIN??? HE HAS EVERYTHING A BOXER NEEDS TO BE ON TOP...BUT HE DOES NOT USE HIS QUALITIES.... HE HAVE TO CHANGE HIS COACH!
I noticed AJ doesn’t mind white people spending their money at his events
Fury , Wilder and Joyce will beat Joshua....he'll duck gtghem all..
Both of them have no footing technique.
AJ    looked slow and cumbersome -he is finished -too heavy too slow -needs to go back to how he was in his last fight
A.j thinks chopping down trees is the cure haha  he got took the distance and for all the power he said he has he couldn't finish his dinner .. Eddie hearns puppet
Holding going on there.
Franklin boxed well was a very tough opponent for joshua i saw that as a draw personally both did well but clearly joshua is lacking confidence and conviction, we are yet to see The Old Anthony Joshua the knockout king but with another 4 fights against midcarders who knows he might find that eye of the tiger he once had, a little bit of advice tho Aj if ya wanna sell out tickets next time don't book your fight on the night of Wrestlemania Saturday 😂
The only BELT Joshua deserves to wear is the one that holds his BESPOKE TROUSERS UP !
That lead uppercut was money!
Next fight Anthony Joshua vs. Jarrell Miller There is a unfinished business between them.
AJ only chicken can't fight with Tyson fury...AJ👎👎👎👎
Just when you think AJ can’t get anymore boring.. stands right in front of the guy, no footwork, no head movement, straight shots only.. what a snooze-fest
Cardio seems to be beter than befoere, but he was not truly tested in this fight to be honest.. No dis to franklin, but I am pretty sure that wilder would konock him out cold via one punch.. Aj was not able to finish him and been cought many many times.. In my opinion Wilder would knock AJ out cold...
Maybe usyk again, best out of 5
AJ got the speed of a turtle if i compare it with tyson fury or deontay wilder hahaha i am sorry fans its just how it isssss
I didn’t know this fight existed until Friday night 😂
Still can't beat usyk
realisticaly aj loses to all the big dons like fury and wilder and joyce and prolly dubois
Aj you ain’t world class 🤦🏼‍♂️
Franklin can beat Fury. But Fury will pay, or this somebody who promotes him.and Franklin would lose.
Boring
Joshua look way better faster in this fight.Gotten a great trainer It all shows in this fight.Congrats Mr Jame.(Spence the Baby Face Bone Crusher.Will destroy Terence bud light Crawford.
I thought was wrestling fight
Boring boring boring! AJ is too slow. He will never become world champion again
That was one boring as fight😂. Heavyweight division has been dead for the longest. It’s all about welterweight, lightweight fights😎
Aj has a broken mind he's over !
Joshua used to have a killer punch
franklin have the stone head))
AJ is back delivering underwhelming performances and continuing his no KO streak
AJ has never been the same since Ruiz ironed him out. He's scared to get hit. Fury or Wilder would wipe the floor with him.
Dull fight
E un po' migliorato col diretto sinistro .ma il resto non cambia
Too heavy, too slow, flat footed, defence is garbage and he seems to have little confidence. Can't for the life of me understand why his team made him the heaviest he's ever stepped into a ring against a guy at 6'2 and over 2 stone lighter (28lbs for yanks). Not impressed
The fight ended when there was 5 seconds left tho
Against decent fighters he can only fight. Against the big names he is nothing.
Joshua bola ye 😅🤣🤣...Lingala au top
Joshua v audley Harrison is about right
1.6m views. People still want to see AJ lets be honest!
Dont know  how he won this  looking at  the video .  Barely  threw a punch
Joshua reminds me of Bruno, very stiff and unnatural boxer.
Franklin won that
Garbage
Expected more ..Anthony did what he needed to but where's the killer?
too focused on tryna be lomachenko loooool hes a hevyweight with a donkey brain he made his name through smashing ppl
o joshua pode lutar com o tyson fury ?
AJ is washed the performance on his end wasn’t so convincing if he fought any top 5 five heavyweight he’s getting battered !!! 😅
👏👏👏👏
Franklin was a better boxer but AJ knows how to get his point similar fight to that of Andy Ruiz jr rematch.
He's been away. He's changed his trainer. He looks the same
Can you imagine what Tyson fury would do to Joshua lool
I need to see another fight between AJ and Andy, could be the impulse for a new opportunity to get a championship
AJ is DEAD!
Kudos to AJ he fought like he was before
AJ aint back, hes still same ol. Let him fight Wilder next then we see if hes really back
Saginaw we here 989
Has been joshua
Joshua won’t get respect until he fights Wilder and Fury
I can not believe how one sided eddy ern show is.. aj isn't a well-man...but not only that Franklin took all aj shots and came bk everytime and hurt aj with them making him stop and reset, where are all them shots.? . and aj needs looking at.. he fears getting hurt and that fear will come true,.. because he's worth more money than what his life is worth...that will leave him bed ridden or in a wheelchair,.. or worse mentally..  Sad times that we will see aj hurt for ever and people will go... ohh the signs were there but we didn't spot them.... no! ...thats not tru this time.. we can all see them.. and if this isn't stopped it could be the end of boxing for all of us.... Sad times we live in when money is worth more than a life...
That was a boring fight
Wooden legs v boy lard ,hes missed the  chance to fight Fury it wont happen-another macho physique washup .
AJ should retire if he don't want to see more losses on his record. If this was in USA, Franklin would be favoured and AJ would be lucky to win judging by this performance. Credit to Franklin was more enjoyable seeing him than AJ.
Hugging Aj 😂 bad fighter this fight was so borning
Remember when everyone thought AJ was great😂😂😂
Rounds 6 & 7 Joshua looked a lot more loose, looked dangerous. The rest of the fight he did look stiff and surprising slow. Possibly a technique to prolonge his cardio? Got the dub, that's the main thing.
In both fights against Usik Joshua was much better,espesially in the second fight.But i hope he will come back.I think it was difficult for him becouse if he lost the fight he would loose all.
Now next fight Anthony Joshua vs. Andy Ruiz There is a unfinished business between them. A Trilogy
Aj looking more stiff than ever
хочу чтоб они разделили между собой все пояса
Still looks too stiff and predictable. No head movement. Fury would play with him and make it look easy.
Doing feints with no combinations is crazy AJ fighting like AB I wonder why he’s scared to let his hands go ugh😢
Joshua, better you retire. Your era is over.
Aj so stiff , fury would school him and wilder would ko him I think
fury
I like Joshua but he has no chance against Fury 🤷🏾‍♂️ Joshua should loose some weight to gain more speed and agility
Joshua scraping by against a nobody… over rated as ever, please let fury have 2 rounds with him.. that’s all he needs 😂😂😂 awful fight
After watching this , fury walks Al over aj , he just doesn’t have any movement at all , getting caught so many times and not trying to move the head , Franklin done a great job , credit to him 👌
11:42 random question but the person rubbing their eyes in the bottom left is that Carl froch or Tony bellew? I dunno I just like to recognise the people I know in the crowd, and the first 2 rows has people like Eddie Hearn and Chisora and I think Josh Taylor's manager
Fury will flog him
Aj is so overrated
Joshua should still retire, boring fighter, boring person and no grace in defeat
DERRICK JAMES IS THE BEST TRAINER I EVER SEEN
Who the fuxk is training joshua? he is standig flat footed with no head movement at all
boring fight i was falling asleep through out
Joshua is done. No aggression. Too much money. Should just quit, wouldn't blame him.
AJ couldn't fight fury now that's just asking for a early deathbed
why does A.J keep looking at the corner or staring away?
Boooring. AJ should retire...
Does anyone notice Joshua has worked on his stamina issue? He did quite well in this fight as someone returning from back to back loses, but I feel he still needs a knockout fight before facing either Fury or Usyk. Nice one AJ; one step at a time.
joshua playing too safe, definately needs more B class  fighters ,he cannot dare fight the A class of the heavyweight division.
Congratulations bro big win
Aj needs to retire boxing cant box anymore
Aj is back confused and afraid 😅
Anthony Joshua is a goner. He is spending more time posturing than boxing. He should switch to Mr. Olympia.
Sorry folks but AJ is just yesterdays HW. He has no right to demand a fight with Fury but should perhaps try and sort a hook up with Wilder in the US. That will be a massive test for him and if he comes thru it then perhaps a Fury fight could happen...
Garbage...
He is so slow.  His jab is nothing. Fury and wilder would smoke him silly
AJ may not have the fire in him as much as he did a few years ago but he still has one of the best boxing résumés out of all the heavyweights in his era 🥊
AJ IS A ROBOT
Trash performance by AJ. couldnt even score a mere knock down. Power isnt the same anymore either.
Well done AJ. I saw so much improvement in you. You fought well. We love you AJ. Your #1 fan🤝💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
That was awful. At this moment. Jake Paul would give him a hard time.
Still not convinced AJ will be fit enough for the top spot …. He is still not letting those arms go and little or less aggressiveness…Little creativity… Legs movement still need much improvement … I hope to see him at the top … Congrats to him on this one and credit to Franklin
Aj box like a robot
Joshua always reminds me of Frank Bruno...He looks the part but isn't aggressive enough...Also he shares one of Brunos really bad features...No composure when under pressure...
He's still  not there  yet ,still  looks  rusty  and  tentative,mentally  broken  still.he will  get there  tho .
AJ won this fight but not on the same level. Tyson Fury was also in similar situation fighting a nobody before the first Wilder fight. Sometimes its the styles which makes the difference. I guess some top class fighters struggle with certain styles of fights. It makes me believe Muhammad Ali style and technique is still the best and no boxer can emulated it.
Masterful performance from AJ
AJ can't even boxing at all, might just retired anyway
yawn fest
Joshua boxing is much better under derek James he schooled franklin.
Seems like Aj turned into Frank Bruno
Джошуа програв.
Couple of Franklin shots that landed would have put Joshua to sleep if Usyk or Fury was behind them.
Joshua was in full control of the situation throughout the fight
all y'all do is type on your keyboards, never been in a fight or even a bit of physical exercise. but online yall are Money Mayweather . Let this man be
Pick on someone your own size....😂
Who do you want to see AJ fight next?
AJ ain't back,  he won't stand up to Wilder power...
Anthony look bad he's washed up...🙉🙈🙊....plus dude could fight.
What a horrible sport blood on the ref,blood on the trunks of AJ
It's hard to knock out someone with such a small head. Casuals don't understand.
He's been boxing from the amateurs, been a world champion, changed trainers and his only improvement is he throws more punches albeit the variation hasn't changed. The constant HOLDING tells you he don't believe in his attack and ain't brave enough to throw combos. All in all despite his chat, he hasn't changed at all.
Why would AJ wear bright red gloves making every punch so visible?
Josua naris de vidro .luta mal muito mal
Am a surpporter of Joshua ,but if he keeps fighting like this ?he might as well just retire from boxing, I thi k something has happened to him and he is yet to recover,he is afraid getting hit so much he could hardly put up a fight ,if he was grabbing that guy ,he won't be able to last that long .
бажаю Єнтоні яскравих перемог. Він хороша людина.
How did the ref not see joshua holding and hitting in round 10? If Franklin had done that he’d have had a point taken off.
Did anyone payed to watch this fight ?
The scores were way off. And Joshua looked like a boxer having their first pro fight. He was like a robot. A robot that didn’t know how to box.
I DON'T HE READY FOR BOXING ANY MORE. HE DOESN'T SHOW THE KILLER INSTINCT .
В одни ворота. Американский боксер не имел ни каких шансов.
My observation in this highlight is that, Franklin is such a dangerous boxer.He ate a lot of heavy shots and reacted so dangerously to them.Don't forget,he has a great chin too,he took Aj's best shots.Hugging is just part of the game, even Aj hugged too.
He  has no chance of becoming a champion he’s way to stiff I think he should give up boxing altogether
Joshua is a coach’s / promoters nightmare he looks and talks so well but just can’t raise his game in that square circle. Money still being made so the circus continues..
A J won but to my mind not naughty enough to regain title
If the highlights were that boring I am glad I didnt have to watch the entire fight. Joshua didnt gas out at steady plod pace but Franklin didnt have the reach or power to put him under any pressure.
What I see of that as half was taken away Franklin had until the last 2 rounds
Aj is back..🤔and the same as ever...😂
boring fight.aj cant get into the top by that performance
the titles misleading, dont get me wrong I love AJ but that wasn't him in the ring, that was a shell of the fighter he used to be
no thrill fight
Aj looks so stiff, just closed. No combos, looks amateur.
Joshua's head movement and foot work gets him in trouble. The jab and power are unquestionable. If he moved his head better and closed the gap from different angles he would still be one of the most dangerous men in boxing.
AJ is a mess. His " eye of the tiger"  is blind.
Naaaa.... he's done.
Have him try Fury or Usik
again a very boring fight by AJ. whole fight you watch the same thing again and again, nothing special and this is so called top level heavyweight fight. when you watch 70's 80's 90's this would be called trash. Klitschko killed boxing, fury and AJ nailled it.
Joshua is done , stiff and boring . He'll get folded up by any class boxer .
Aj is too stiff almost robot like
Still throwing tantrums after the final bell 😂 keep it fakely humble 😊
The thing about Joshua is he has the flat feet,  he doesn't move like a boxer should,  Frank Bruno was awkward looking Joshua more so
I get these are big guys but Franklin looked the better boxer. AJ was stood upright, no footwork or head movement whatsoever and didn’t display a decent arsenal of weapons at all. Fury knocks AJ out within 6 rounds.
Not back, he only win... Thats IT.. A. Ruiz jr destroyer AJ psychics
Franklin clearly the better boxer but AJ never fights anyone his height or build. I know it won't happen but fury would dispatch him comfortably
HE'S A SPARRING PARTNER FOR JOSHUA. A WARM -UP AND THE ANNOUNCER IS AS PHONY AS THE FIGHT A.J. NOT SHOWING ANY IMPROVEMENTS.
What a boring fight
Joshua overated because he's British
to be fair, the best fights at this event was the punters getting thrown out by security rather than anything going on in the ring
Joshua is done.
Joshua has zero chance against Fury, Joyce, Wilder...
Tyson Fury & Deontay wilder is a different level, AJ lost it with the defeat against Andy Ruiz!
Aj is bot beating the bronze bomber
Sorry but I don't see AJ making much of a comeback.
Not a convincing win
I was bored watching these highlights, I'd be wanting a refund if I was there...
Aj
Advi e to joshua.stay away from deontay Wilder..he.ll be put to sleep 😮.
What a sad performance…..He’s fighting scared!!
The reff looked like he been boxin too
Нет,нет,чтобы кто,не говорил,но Джошуа потерял свою былую лёгкость и боксирует очень напряжённо и медленно !!!Могу сказать,что Джо Джойс его деклассирует легко!!!
Fury or Wilder put AJ to sleep in the early rounds!!!
More comments from nerds who have never stepped in the ring
On this showing should retire ASAP before he gets hurt AJ not brutal enough
Aj won't be elite again unless he does 2 things 1 is get his emotions in check, he really can't take strong punches, so, he gets emotional in the ring and it shows that he's peaked at this point not being able to win his most important fights recently and 2 he has to also have a different style of training camp he seems to focus on the same things and that won't help him improve to reach newer heights. Side note: he would've lost his fight to Andy if the money didn't get to Andy's head he clearly came unprepared for Anthony and yet he still made it through. Had he lost that fight he'd truly would be done.
Stiff as a board 🤣 n aj thinks he’s any where near fury with that performance…urm nope 🤣
TRAGEDY!!!!
stamina wise AJ has improved a lot, but in doing so he seems to have forgot all of his routes, super stiff and only throwing 1,2s and ducking. Not sure what happened to the old AJ that was throwing combos, moving, going for the finish etc, seems to have completely lost that aggression he came up on.
AJ STOP BEING GENTLE WHEN FIGHTING PLEASE.
Which of you idiots paid for this fight and put money in AJ’s pocket?  The AJ that said only buy in black owned businesses. A guy that’s sponsored by a white billionaire. And has a white promoter 🤣🤣🤣
Can you add some slomo shots at the end of each round
i am not impressed with AJ
AJ fights like a scared fighter. Too many arm punches which has no power.  The Klitchco brothers  can get away with fighting like this because they have power to knock you out. The trainers for AJ are failing him. Joshuas career is over fighting like this. What a waste.
Boring fight!
Step by step King step by step.
AJ should retire
Хороший парень Франклин, успеха ему в будущем!) но остаюсь поклонником Джошуа.
Boxing is soooo boring. Snooze Fest.
Fury,Usyk and Wilder run through AJ in my opinion if he fights like this
AJ is just an average fighter now. Whatever aggression and confidence he had when he first turned pro, is gone and that's never coming back, especially fighting the likes of Franklin and never even looking close to knocking him out.  As soon as he's been put in with anyone decent, he's lost. While Fury may be a drug taking clown, he would box the head off AJ and would probably do it for 12 rounds just to prove a point. AJ has believed his own hype when he first turned pro and has tried to convince people he's this deep thinking man, what with all his cringy quotes he picked up from self help books. You can see the oppressed anger he has when he does his interviews and he needs to let that out in the ring. I mean, look at the end of the fight last night, he could barely control himself when it kicked off at the end of the fight. He should have lost that aggression during the fight, not keep it for afterwards. He will get KO'd by any of the fighters mentioned. Whyte, Wilder, Fury...even Joseph Parker could have another go and he'd beat him too. It's time for AJ to end it as he just doesn't have it any more. Take the money and run kid.
Ruiz Jr destroyed the hungry and confident finisher AJ used to be. Totally different fighter these days and for me just doesn’t look convincing. It’s almost as if when he lands a punch he backs off because he’s terrified to get hit.
AJ stop boxing
Commentators  love Joshua and praised him a lot.  To my kind opinion, the credit goes to Franklin. Bravo.
Joshua got away with constant holding whenever Franklin wanted to fight on the inside and he punched Franklin on the referee’s break without punishment, all things being even the outcome might’ve been different
Joshua is stiff as a board. He will never regain the heavyweight title. A few more fights and he's done.
AJ needs that Rocky 3 treatment. Come to the states and train in a gritty boxing gym in somewhere like Philadelphia. He’s needs edge and aggression. He hasn’t been the same since Ruiz.
Why did AJ turned down alot of fights to be here bullying decent fighters who are honestly climbing up the rank?
The King is a gipsy King 🔥🔥🔥💪🏼😂
Usyk stole this man's soul. He has never been the same fighter ever since.
AJ just isn't the same boxer after the Ruiz defeat. I no longer think he has the minerals to compete with the top 5 heavy weights.
10 rounds of the most timid jab I have ever seen, followed by a couple of rounds in which AJ attempted an uppercut or two. Franklin rode AJ’s right hand which was signalled every time and had no follow up combination. I’m surprised Franklin didn’t step in and dominate the fight (unless he was paid not to). Credit to the commentators for trying to instil some excitement but nothing about AJ’s performance suggested a threat of anger or violence.
Franklin vs Andy Ruiz matchup!
🤣🤣😂😂Joshua beating a Nobody
Joshua needs to learn: angles, cutting off the ring, getting outside and proper loading in front of his opponent. He's very rigid. Besides right hook in early 12 he's needs to concern opponent with more punches (1-2,1-1-2). Wilder should be next. Usyk and Fury beat him easy.
Garbage!!!
It's Franklin fs nothing to be proud of
Frank Bruno 2.0 so robotic way too much muscle
Joshua is so tired...
AJ back 🤣🤣🤣🤣,he was so average. Wilder,fury would destroy him
Imagine what a prime Mike Tyson would have done with such a stagnant Anthony Joshua
Joshua walczy strasznie schematycznie i zachowawczo. Brakuje mu dynamiki, dłuższych kombinacji i agresji w ringu. Co się stało że starym dobrym Joshuą który nie bał się bitki i szedł na wymiany 😐
Aj is not smart, skillful and  stronger enough to be a champion again. He also lack stamina
3 minutes in and im bored.
I hope Michel and Trevor came to see their friend
All his losts ffected on his confidence to let his hands go man
Trying to box like klitchko and BORING
Who is franklin? i heard first time. its not a big fight for AJ. he is didn't come back.
Sorry AJ, but,,,,,,, Mehhh,,,,,
You can see how Joshua started afraid and with no confidence, but it was growing as the fight progressed, by the end I think we got the regular AJ back, but already tired as natural on a 12r
So AJ and Wilder still not happening
I forgot about aj I remember he use to be that guy
Joshua’s footwork was 🤪
Joshua not only stands like a block of concrete in the ring  But has never ever defended his title . That rings alarm bells to me. He is such a boring fighter that boxing History will never bring up any of his fighting career in the future but for his opponents he lost to. He is truly just a boxer with a household name for housewives and reality TV and nothing more
No way joshua ever wanted to fight wilder ! He gets put to sleep I see why that fight didn’t happened !
Aj still dodging me!
Embarrassing.
His right hand parry to a jab leaves his face open to his opponents cross every time.
AJ should quit. He was slow, lacked head movement and didn't look like he wanted to be there. Recipie for getting badly hurt if he steps in again with top fighters.
This fight IS a joke.joshua do you want to fight my grandma of 80 years old
So boring
AJ vs Wilder
This is the level AJ should stay at though, he can't fight elite fighters, he's never been at that level.
No disrespect to Franklin as he did well to hang in there but AJ needs to dump these guys in 6 rounds if he’s to take on another title shot
Joshua is a now only a top 10 to top 5 fighter..... Ruiz took his confidence  & Usky took his soul...... he will never beat Usky in a million years if ever to meet again, fury will have him for breakfast, joe joyce & Dubois would beat him too...... and the sad thing is there all average fighters in a woeful heavyweight era.... apart from Usky who is the only one who is World class & he's not even a heavyweight.... Joshua should retire he's had his time in the sun.... and Fury should follow suit as he's becoming a joke..... won't fight Usky because he know's his no. Is up.....!!!
Happens to so many fighters. They lose once and they’re never the same. Tyson a prime example. Hope he gained some confidence and he loosens up but probably won’t happen
I fell asleep. AJ, what an overated, boring plug of a fighter
Love Joshua but I can’t see that as a win
Back to fighting B-level opponent
AJ is DONE. you know his team knows it they’re top notch. He’s so gifted and such a hard worker
Aj is back😂😂 he's absolutely garbage, he's  a very basic boxer at best
On another note, I like how DAZN is taking notes from how Japanese film their fights, with zooming in first before switching angles
Was a clean victory 12 round lockout but I'm disappointed he couldn't finish him. He is holding back his punches and his movement is no fluid
Wilder vs Joshua  🔥vs🌪️
Am so happy for you  and I hope you will face Fury
Like that new jab josh
Will never spend another penny on this robotic fake corporate clown
Shame...again. no self control
C'est mérité
Does anyone even care any more? 😂😂
Joshua should throw the towel in he’s not as spicy as he used to be I think he’s done. But respect to both fighters
That Joyce fellow would win against Aj IMO
It’s as if AJs become even worse than before.
On his way to get back to his championship era
Horrible .... If I was his coach I would have gave him his money back.... And kicked him out of my Gym...   How many coaches does it take to tell him the truth stop taking this man's money.... It's over  what a joke ...
Tune up fight no doubt but he still needs to work on somethings
Not on Furys level
Well let's be fair aj hardly made a big statement. Pretty boring fight..glad I didn't pay to watch
Wow AJs footwork is atrocious like Wilder, they should fight 😅
🥱
boxing such a dead sport
Aj looked bad on purpose to be offered a bigger fight
10:33
AJ looks slow and too cautious IMO he’s holding back a lot
Yeh aj is finished
I Miss Mike Tyson 🤦🏽‍♂️ What's all This 12 Round Advil Pills. A Disgrace. Miss the Golden Era from Ali,Sonny Liston,George Forman,Joe Frazier,Evander Holyfield,Lennox Lewis, Klitschko. This Generation has Only Tyson Fury. The rest is forced hype. Fury is Alone out There 🤦🏽‍♂️
Nice one bro
Aj last 2 fights he has acted unprofessionally at the end of the fights. Stay HUMBLE YALL
Imagine Joshua fighting Wilder or Fury, he gets KOd on the first for sure. Wonder where'd that confidence and boxing skills go
Joshua hasn't learnt even against B graders
Washed aj wouldn't last 3 rounds with fury
Joshua really isn’t the same man anymore.
I am sorry but how aj had to take it to the judges is cringe, clearly with his advantages there sould be a tko atleast.
I see he has Errol Spence trainer
All that size and no power AJ it's time to hang up those gloves and go get a proper job👍
Aj is not in top 5 right now this win  is just poor try
Joshua won but he ain't the same. He's not championship material anymore! He should probably consider retiring. Just saying. Not to mention he had all the help in the world from the ref.
AJ is adonis creed verse real life character.
Another typical wooden joshua performance, sad really
Ajs literally nothing but basic.. never gonna change.. could put a glass eye to sleep
AJ slower than coastal erosion
Wow boxing is really dead huh?
AJ fights like Errol Spence Jr 😂 now...
Jermaine Who??
such Joshua Usyk will outbox again, he has nothing final.
That was sparing with a TV camera there let down
He fought a very safe fight, I think his own comments on he’ll retire if he doesn’t win this one was playing on his mind to much. He shouldn’t have ever spoke that ultimatum into his head, then we might have gotten a more aggressive AJ. At the end of the day maybe he’s trying to maintain that weight and see if he can hold a consistent fight pace over 12 rounds with someone at this level of boxing to bring these experiences with him into future fights. I think when he watches this back he’ll see what he needs to improve on and hopefully implement these things into future fights, this is the rebuild of AJ after all. There was nothing on the line really here so he might as well get that experience under his belt of being at his carrier heaviest and doing the full 12 rounds whilst he’s fighting someone who isn’t a Wilder, Fury ect.
AJ it's over, if it ever began. It's time to get into buying property or doing podcasts for AJ
Hopefully Joshua gets back on top again
AJ needs to retire
fair Play 🏆 Anthony King 🥊
Joshua is the most over hyped boxer
I was expecting more from him to me just wasn’t busy enough it was a improvement but he needs to get a lot busier if he is gonna beat the heavy weights that have hands
Wish he had lost.
That was uninspiring 😩
Average fighter beats on points below average fighter who was hand picked for him to knock out. Fight Fury.
Where did you find that commentator and can he go back there?
Doesn't look the same Joshua at all somthings going on with him looks scared
joshua should've been getting teched all fight.. all he does is punch then hug.. punch then hug.. punch and hug.. shouldn't be allowed to keep doing that.
“Professional boxers” played like amateurs. Franklin played whole fight with guard down and taller AJ with longer hands didn’t catch him for knockout. Old time boxers will beat them both. Where is the boxing now? Shame!!!
Watching AJ box, is like watching a boxing game on the PlayStation one.
Anthony knows if he lost this fight, he would lose everything,  so he just kinda lost
The old aggressive AJ is dead. That hungry beast that would go in for the KO and knocked out the likes of Klitschko is long gone after he made millions on sponsorship deals.   He’s not just a shell of himself trying to take zero risks while trying to stay relevant without the belts. Look at this fight. He should’ve easily finished it off with a KO but he played it in safe.
Joshua too Big to be doing all that holding....😡😡😡 all them new coaches need to teach him how not too hold💯💯💯💯💯
AJ Looked average at best won’t beat any of the top 5 with that performance we saw
Man its getting hard to watch an AJ fight
Ngannou vs josua ....❤
even the highlights are boring
Bless him just where he belongs fighting people nobody has heard of 🤔😂😂
''back'' hahaha. Was never here. Primark shop manikin.
Congrats to the hype train,  you couldnt stop a nobody
Aj has moulded into frank bruno 1-2 move thats it
Joshua seemed uninterested. His mind wasn't there
AJ should have called out Wilder in my opinion 😐
I thought the old AJ was coming back for this fight.. but hes still fighting Usyk by the looks of it
I think Franklin just wanted a cuddle
He will never hold a belt again!!
Has AJ gone Bruno ? Looks flat as f 2 me
That was a boring Fight nothing Special about it.
No more excuses for AJ. That was so poor last night. So, so poor. What evidence do we have to refute the contention he's washed? I can't think of any tbh. By contrast, we now have abundant evidence that there's nothing left.
Never realised before just how stiff legged Joshua is, just no mobility
Ill tell you prankly Joshua's move is a level of a amateur .
Another boring performance from AJ!! Franklin I think had a better performance
AJ, he seems very timid in the ring now. He dosent take any risks, I understand he is being careful and not underestimating anyone but I feel that the scrutiny he recieved for losing against the fat mexican and having to regain his title only to lose it to Usyik has made him TOO careful in the ring to the point where he wont fight any fight unsafe.
Franklin a normal, modest boxeur. Joshua is'not a champion...
Aj is a decent boxer. He just isnt top level material. He has a hard punch, great in shape body, cardio is ok. Besides that its just average. Technical its meh. Looks very stiff. Footwork decent. Gets hit alot, never sets up decent combinations. 1-2 / 1-2 and the left hook coming in wild is his thing.   He is just to stiff and predictable. Decent boxer, not top level. And nothing wrong with that. Respect for his hard work.
Joshua is washed. Time for him to hang up the gloves
Joshua is clearly being coached well on how to box. He uses his jabs to set up heavier armo now unlike in d past. He'll need it against better opponents like Fury.
ce mec est une plaisanterie......!!
AJ improve nothing!! And if really he want to grab another serious belt in future, he most do away with that fear of been attached!! And attack like a wounded 🦁 since the energy is there.
franklin looks like if salt papi was championship level
And Joshua can beat Fury? I don’t think so lol. Not like this
Joshua gas gone backwards
aj needs to quit now he wont last in the ring with the top guys
I think Joshua is a boring fighter tbh...
AJ can't get anywhere close to champion again with this kind of shy fighting
everyone is seeing what im seeing...he looks hesistant and hes not attacking enough but he does look in amazing shape and he did show some skills  and patience but maybe too conservative...see how he does next match but this AJ would not last 1 round vs the AJ of old
Joshua fights like a man who knows he has a glass jaw,  his time is over.
Aj stopped knocking men out 🙄, what’s missing
AJ washed
AJ .  Overrated, he's done ✔️
Another hilarious opponent for the bodybuilder and he still can’t knock him out
British commentatory is always biased.
Who was the dude in his corner throwing all those moves between each round. Never seen coaching like that during a fight, he’d have been better fighting him and would probably have done a better job than AJ 🫤
Joshua would struggle against mayweather now.
Great fight! Well done AJ!
what a boring match
'Back' is a bit of an overstatement . Stiff and cumbersome .
Team Fury whip this AJ fool
AJ just looked like he was bored the whole fight
I appreciate how boring this fight was . AJ should fight on ESPN next.
Was not impressed, AJ's best days look to be completely over. I think Whyte could possibly KO him.
Time to face it he is finished as a champion fighter no heart for the fight wilder would crush him no where for him to go and Tyson is just winding people up This is the worst he has fought he gets tagged and retreated every time typical bully mentality can give but not prepared to take it
Embarrassment after fight ended again....mans just not got it...hopeless
Joshua didn’t look as robotic added a nice lead uppercut.
That was fighting two oldboys?
if franklin thrown his overhand right most often...joshua maybe in trouble
AJ WILL NEVER HOLD A WORLD TITLE, he's got lead feet and oak tree arms
Return fight might be a disaster for AJ,he seems not sure of himself.
First time seeing AJ so concentrated, great fight AJ well done bro
Uncle tom has got a glass jaw
AJ is back ,what a joke 😂😂😂
Ever since the ruiz fight Anthony Joshua has become so one dimensional. Footwork poor,combos almost non existence. That loss definitely damaged him.
AJ beating some random guy, yey he's back
Glad I never paid for this
The best 💪🏻
Joshua is back!!! 😅 embarrassing man
I see why Fury offered that 90% deal
Credit to Franklin all the way
How did Joshua not get a point deduction for hitting on the break at 11:45?
He will be killed in the ring if he fights fury or wilder like that😮
AJ is not back at all! That was poor! He is scared to let his hands go he barely threw any combinations. Ever since fat boy Andy Ruiz smashed him all around the ring he has never been the same for fear of getting embarrassed in front of all them people. His head has completely gone!
Aj isnt comeback.. Hes just come to the ring. Aj isn’t fight Hes just boxing Everybody know he’s always affraid
Waste of time 😑😑😑
No killer instinct shown here at all. Fury will have no problem making this fight and it will be over in 6 rounds when Fury has boxed him into retirement.
AJ reminds me of how Bob Sapp used to fight
This fight was 60% boring.... If Anthony meet any fast puncher or aggressive fighter he will lose as he is no longer aggressive....
Holding or pulling head now legal. Nice.
Fight wilder... he's going to sleep
Not enough for Fury. No combinations too slow holds too much the Gipsy will teach him a lot
Well I'm glad I didn't pay to watch that
He's no chance of beating Fury.   That's why he hides from him.... Useless
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
This is why Fury has ducked Joshua for so long. ´Tony would destroy him with this technical&tactical style.
Joshua beat a nobody. That’s cute.
Joshua fight is with Joshua. He is scared to lose
He's looking worst than before
If he'd relax and fight like the last 3 rounds he's still got a shot at any title..
Fury would have finished this guy in 3 or 4 rounds
Aj stands too tall for my liking he should bend the knees a lil more well done he should fight Joe Joyce next
🥱😴💤
Did you guys notice that the referee had a white top at the beginning and towards the end its pink and bloody
Antony Joshua is back but I still think that  Wilder or Fury will KO him.
I feel Joshua still need the aggressive ness of Mike Tyson in his style of fighting and yes usky did a lot of damage to his mindset cause we can see he his hesitating to throw punches unlike the Joshua we know,kudo his coach please bring out the beast in him .I would suggest he spar with Mike Tyson the more
Still the same Joshi to me, dry fighter and no skill
Andy Ruiz owns AJ’s soul. He’s afraid to engage, it looks like
Joshua before ruiz would have knocked out JF in 6 rounds. Needs that eye of the tiger back.
Today boxing is boring
No where near, Fury, Usyk or Wilder…
Well done Anthony Joshua his Aim was to knock down Franklin but he was stamina in Joshua body all the ranks from 6 to 12.
Wilder knocks them both out two rounds if not one round
To much focus on the physique, less on boxing itself. Let´s wait and see what the future brings..
Kudos 👏
AJ can now retire with that fight.
What a decent fighter! @fankling!!
AJ is my Man but dem He needs more aggression 🥊 don’t fight like a business Man💕😇
AJ ist mehr beschäftigt sein rechtes Kien zu schützen
Was boring
Fights like this makes me question people who watch boxing.I've been skipping a highlight video of a fighting match just to see some action and still couldn't see any.
The lord of the ring is back🎉🎉congratulation A-J
'AJ IS BACK' man was never there after his loss to Ruiz
Да до Усика им еще далеко.
Jashua Is Pure GARBAGE!!!! CHEATED & Still Couldn't do Nothing 🤣🤓 GARBAGE!!!!
AJ has known his level since he got hurt and embarrassed by Ruiz Jnr. Been terrified of getting hit ever since. Would rather see him fight Wilder before disappearing than getting embarrassed by Fury.
Uninspiring.
Ucube Joshua eski tarzına dön bok gibisin
Like watching paint dry.  Retire dude.
Jermaine got paid? The guy is fighting like Fousey
he really has to learn to be the bigger stronger man, he towers over most heavyweights
Safe game plan to box him outside
AJ is done at top level...he was awful last night, wouldn't throw combos cause he was afraid of getting hit in the process.....Fury kills him, Joe Joyce knocks him out
The most boring fight I’ve ever witnessed
Pathetic fight how do people enjoy jushua fights that's if you can call them fights .Mind you it makes people think he is better than he is by fighting someone smaller weaker and inferior and adds zeros to the next purse .Joshua is a manufactured cash machine and a useless pudding
AJ doesn't look comfy in the Ring, too hesitant, his footwork is awful, although i can't be bothered with either of them, I hate to say it but Luke would beat him easily
Respect To Franklin 💗👍
Franklin fought a great fight 👍🏼
Клинчи, джебы, неспешная ходьба по рингу...
Heavyweight division is trash,
AJ is back lol
Who?....when is 'Tank' fighting next??🙂
Laaaaaame
Джошуа завязуй иди домой
Its cool to see AJ's trunks slowly going from white to red over the whole fight.
Lets go fury
Glorified sparring match
If he's in control, he's ok, but ?
It looks like Joshua is too scared to be offensive. He now fights like a regular, not a world champion. Seems something has been wrong with his style is that Ruiz punches he received.
AJ will never be a boxer.
AJ  is still not ready for the gypsy king.. his defenses are weak.. the American landed heavy shots that AJ had no answers to..
He did well you could see Jermaine has faster hands If he does not hold him like Fury would people would complain he does not know how to fight like a bigger man also note he did not gas out JF has never been knocked out before so some people are just different
Nothing wrong with Joshua's tank. 36 rounds in last 3 fights. A win is a win, back on track. People expect more of him than of any other fighter out there. Give him a break. And some credit
Hmm, unconvinced. AJ would seem to be another Frank Bruno - all the tools to be a boxing great, but lacking that edge to properly use them. He's an athlete not a fighter. Maybe a little more talent than Frank, but without Frank's chin.
Joshua 👎
Easy money for Fury....
Aj literally had Franklin gone in round 10 and 12 but the guy kept leaning on him. Not much you can do
Commentary was very biased and Tony bellew gave Joshua 20 rounds out of 12. Ridiculous
Joshua was about to do dirt on Franklin on round 12 if franklin weren’t so grabby
Like going back in time and watching Frank Bruno , he made hard work of that fight ! Against Fury  ? Mmm......
A decent victory - well done, AJ 🥊👍
AJ did not win
Ducking wilder, Fury to this? C'mon AJ...
I thought Joshua fell into obscurity.. haven’t seen nor really even heard of him for about 2 years.
Joshua looks worse here than he did against Usyk, honestly I reckon Wilder can beat Joshua.
💤💤💤
Franklin of course was outsized. I've not been impressed by Joshua since the first Ruiz fight. If he ever faces Fury, things won't go well for him.
Definitely a problem with AJ’s nose before the fight. He was seen with blood on his vest and then his corner were instructing him not to blow it between rounds. That aside, I’ve seldom seen a HW boxer have such little self belief. The Andy Ruiz Jr KO has really messed with his mentality and Usyk has completely broken him. He really does not like getting hit. Came out to do the business but as soon as Franklin landed it was the same old story I’m afraid. He shouldn’t be anywhere near a power puncher at the minute. Even Whyte would be bad news.
AJ is back😂 Franklin not even a contender maann😅
Zero inside work from AJ…he still sees that Ruiz hook every time he gets in tight with an opponent
Too big too plodding, if he cant knock out a journey man half his size concentrate on business enterprises and stop being greedy.
COME ON BOYS HE GOT THE WIN SO HATS OFF TO HIM.
“Everybody has a face until they get punch in the plan”  -J.F Kennedy probably
Fury would have a field day with Joshua he's gone robotic
No! He's still not recovered from that Ruiz' punch....
I'm sorry AJ is a boring boxer tell me this guy is stiff he doesn't have much combos in his Arsenal George Foreman has more moves then this guy just saying 😂😂
He needs to change his fighting style if he’s to prove anything. The  class has worn off and his opponents have improved.
It’s commendable that AJ doesn’t want to get involved in wars, for his long term health. But this safety first approach ends his status as a stadium fighter. People won’t want to come to watch him. He hasn’t really delivered excitement for years now. Which is fine, no shame in it. But don’t buy into Hearn’s hype - which is probably more exciting than an AJ fight these days.
Aj just needs time he’ll be back and better, I’ll back my boy no matter what 🔥
Why is everyone saying the comeback is on for Joshua? He was fighting a nobody & it went to the judges scorecards. If that was fury or usyk they would’ve knocked him out within 3 rounds.
Highlights 😂😂😂😂 we’re there any highs
AJ looks lazy and unenthusiastic.. I'm worried about him he had a Oliver McCall look in this fight. He made need serious counseling.
How did you find 13 minutes of highlights from that borefest.
Joshua 3.0? 4.0? Whatever, Joshua X.0 looked stiff as a board this fight. Maybe he should go back and focus on the sweet science cuz this version of Joshua that faced Jermaine Franklin can never be great.
11'48 + 12'55 ... pathetic
Joshua this gens Frank Bruno. Looks the part but no killer.
👎
I will continue to miss Mike Tyson.
I think AJ needs to find his own boxing style instead of the textbook boxing style he's using, very boring to watch. He just seems to have no controlled aggression and anger to start firing devastasting shots, I think he needs to cut weight from his arms and upper torso, and get much elasticated refelexes. I dont see him becoming champ again after that performance.
Ruiz ripped his heart out with them knockdowns. Lost all of his attacking and powerful killer instinct punching in the ring,  shadow of his former self.  Replacing trainers has no made one difference.
Joshua stinks
das war doch kein gegner . wollt ihr mich verkackeiern
This is prank! Two idiots!
AJ looking like KSI in there.. shocking he had so many belts
AJ's body looks better year on year.. boxing skills- you be the judge.
I don't see AJ becoming world champion again dispite the results, he seems to be still missing the size of the dog in him honestly, doesn't look hungry at all anymore, rewatch the fight again and see how his movements are... anyways congrats AJ👏👏👏
Lots of cheap shot holding behind the head and hitting from AJ. Hometown ref trying to get AJ one more shot at the title but he stands no chance. All championship reigns come to an end and AJ's is long gone.
Joshua had adapted to the Wladimir Klitschko style: jab and hold, jab and hold, jab and hold.
Interesting how the 'highlights'  didn't show the punch that bloodied Joshua's nose.
Lol had to struggle for a win vs a journeyman... shows all you need to know.  Don't even talk about title shots eddie
Boooooooooooooring fight
AJ must just be patient. And he can beat anyone
Joshua is so SLOW people see his punches coming....
How come this fight was a 12 rounder? Neither of them hold titles. A real farce. DAZN and Match room pimping their boy who wouldn't last past 4 or 5 rounds against Joyce, Dubois, Wilder and yes even Ruiz.
Joshua ain't even got power no more was at least expecting a knock down
Joshua n'est qu'un géant en carton!
All people are talking, Joshua easily won. 👊🏿
Put AJ in with Wilder , that should retire him
Boring
Gun shy joshua .he's done
Time to retire the racist Joshua…poor fighter
This generations Frank Bruno
Big bowling ball arms is dreadful to watch.
This is and has always been Joshua's problem. Every fight is like a training session. I don't mean he dominates his opposition but he just had zero killer instinct. Its like he has no desire to win and just treats another half arsed day in the office.
Joshua face aux boxeurs rapides, il est en danger
They could've left out the 16+ violent warning on this one! Lol.  Pillow fists
Joshua , worse boxer ever ... Couldn't even couldn't even ko this guy ... Big champion 😂
it's cray how many people are blind to thefact that joshua has added more guile and naughtiness to his game. I think he has improved.
Commentators absolutly dreadful
Stopit! The ref allowed Joshua to hold Franklin’s head down while gabbing
8:24 - 8:35 That was Nice
BORING..!!!
Aj needs more fights. He didnt use his strenghten.
Stay away from fury aj you look bad
Is this punching or hugging?
Aj fought fairly measured, I imagine he was keen for the knockout but the fact that Franklin seems to have a titanium chin and came shooting back with fast counters everytime he got clocked kept Joshua honest. Dominated on the cards, much better job than DW did on Franklin, infact if that was Whyte in there with AJ I think He would have got sparked before 7, DW that is.
Yawn
AJ has lost that knockout frame of mind. Become super defensive
Joshua is turning into frank Bruno not there is anything wrong with our English treasure
The commentary is absolutely awful
не увидел в ринге чемпиона,  ни бывшего, ни будущего.....
Beautiful and USEFUL on Youtube Hidajet Hodžić
AJ fans pure spastics enough said .
Why are his feet so slow??? He used to dance, now he waits.
AJ LET YOUR FCKEN HANDS GO  your getting older
The Joshua ride is over, yes he will get a few more pay days. Watching him is like re watching frank bruno, capable of knocking you out but doesn’t want too
These fighters be ducking the matches we all want to see.
Fair play to the warehouse operative Franklin
Aj finally learnt how to box, sadly post his peak.
Самый скучный бой
I miss the holifield,Mike Tyson,Lennox era what I’m i watching now smh
AJ is back hahahahahahahaha give it a rest fools you signed a sausage and you know it .
This big, sorry bloke was simply fighting not to lose. There was no killer instinct, and he couldn't /wouldn't impose his will on Franklin to put the boxing world on notice. A fighter in name and stature only.
I think Anthony is just too much of a nice bloke to be a boxer.
не думал что будут все 12 раундов...похоже 2 проигрыша от Усика дают о себе знать...
Terrible fight.
Very static and always same combination! No surprises he lose!🫡
Жду Джошуа vs Фьюри
Look at the size difference ! Like me fighting my 12 year old nephew. Sad.
Joshua is finished he’s a physical specimen but you can see he’s to tentative in the ring now you can literally see he’s scared to get hurt and it’s ruined his style he needs to retire where does he go from here because unless one of those belts is vacated he has no chance
One of the most coward boxer I ever seen Joshua isn't a fighter by heart he is made and force to be a fighter
I would say it was either a draw, or a win for Franklin.
😮😮😮😮
пока месть посмотрел только 3 раунд,  уже видно страх и осторожность Джошуа. .... смотрю дальше..
Poor Franklin, I felt sorry for him. Next fight for him Jake Paul 🤣🤣🤣
Franklin is a problem 💨
Thanks, but why put the result in the headline, most people cannot watch the live fight and don't know the result.....
Look how much AJ is holding... 👀
I think Joshua was holding out till the bell, but very poor show and Franklin looked more ambitious.
Snoozzzzz
Joshua aint beating Fury with that type of performance...
Looks like a journeyman now, not a championship contender.
Joshua Will not defeat Tyson fury and Wilder... He is too slow and no power punch
So glad to see years later the world open their eyes About the level of Anthony Joshua :)   great guy tho
Pathetic
Fair play yo AJ but he really is so boring to watch, it's like watching a robot 🤷‍♂️
Wilder woulda been knocked out AJ wilder just different in my opinion aj to slow to much muscle slows him down every fight
Franklin isn't a power puncher!
Very very dull
This fight is an absolute waste of time why doesn't Joshua fight someone his own level and size this is ridiculous
Not impressive win for AJ. He cant use his height and reach advantage to the maximum
🥱🥱
Unfortunately AJ doesn’t look like he’s enjoying it anymore. Still won almost every round though.
Round 12  0:36 seconds Franklin nearly knocked Joshua out. Joshua’s finished. Usyk finished it for him. Fury would literally beable to do wateva he liked to AJ in the ring.
AJ needs to do more, but anyway congratulations
Time to retire
Boxing is dead
Ajs finished
Fury KO’s AJ every day, week, month, year century, light year, galaxy, universe lol
Фьюри Ссыкло
Joshua is done ,so what he won on points,, this is a man that ranks himself still as one of the top 3 boxers v a boxer ranked 30th,  he's a fraud if he goes on , he will never be world champion not now..
AJ definitely deserved the decision, but there wasn’t enough convince he’ll be champion again. Fury would have no problem beating this version of AJ.
In for the money stretching out the rounds , holding back to not take chances. AJ is no Mike tyson however his trainers restrict his natual fighting skills.
He is finished, he is so stiff now it's like rigour mortis is setting in, it's a shame really.
Как он вообще был чемпионом?🎉
Them cards were a joke it was well closer
If AJ cant take a KO here, I dont think he will do better with Fury and wilder...
Jab jab hook hug random upper cut.
Joshua holding and hitting in round 10 also hitting on the break. Poor show.
AJ is too clean to fight. I think preaching a gospel is the best job for him. That’s my opinion.
Heavyweight hugging match!!! Amazing.
Hate to say it but AJ's time has been and gone, he's lost the aggression he used to have, I think the back to back loses and the loss with Ruiz has finished him, he knows he can be beaten now so he's way more cautious to go in banging, might be time to hang up the gloves....
Ive seen more skill in a street fight. I mean seriously, today's heavyweights are so straight up and down. Especially Anthony Joshua. David Tua would of destroyed Joshua in half a round. Holyfield would of attacked these guys relentlessly nonstop for 3 rounds if he hadn't already knocked them out. Joshua to me looks so scared these days.
Lol yh not quite 😂
AJ looked average as f*ck, never been a great.
Aj flat footed. No footwork at all. Shoulder too stif he has power but not speed or snap punch he use his strength like push punch
AJ is washed up. Might as well get KO’d by wilder for his last big check and hang ‘em up
Décevant anthony joshua
AJ doesn't look himself in this fight. Being very cautious doesn't suit him. Leaves him vulnerable against more skilled opponents. He needs to become the brawler and get busier. Maybe loses the odd fight but entertains and maybe gets the belts back along the way.
If this is what joshua coming back looks like then there is no difference he is still heavy..still the same old joshua nothing changed
I think aj is over hype
AJ fights too laid back. Like he's a bit too hesitant.  imagine him with more aggression.. sheesh
oh man how i miss mike tyson...
Stopped paying to watch AJ a while ago. This is why bc hes boring against everyone.
Pretty boring fight
Andy Ruiz took AJs soul
Gosh.. after all the rebuilding, retraining & rebranding AJ is still incredibly slow & stiff, footwork is not impressive
That’s Joshua’s last fight I think, he looks TERRIBLEi!! It looks like he needed a WEEK in advance appointment before moving to Franklin’s right. WOW.
This is AJs level 😂
😴😴😴
Man this game was very average
this isnt even near furys level
All the aj fans will hate it but the gypsy king would destroy him!!!
I'm happy Joshua won the match but over 75 percent of the punches of Joshua was thrown into the air because He didn't move much closer to Franklin. He would av won b4 half of the rounds.plz plz don't try this with Fury oo. I like U, that's why I'm saying this. Joshua watch ur match and U will see how U gave Franklin strength. Assuming U got closer U will knock him out.
Garbage
A.J. solito sacco di patate!!!
Joshua Joshua Joshua. Along way from wilder or fury. Should’ve taken the opportunities while they were there
Joshua fights so mechanical and boring
AJ mad slow
is this supposed to be entertaining? Imagine paying money to go and watch some guys hug it out
Joshua now reminds me of Frank Bruno, struggled with his opponents hand speed
The commentators are so biased its so annoying
Aj Britain's worst ever boxer . Still looks rigid and robotic.  Time to retire and let the real boxers box fury n usyk.
Aj looked a bit nervous understandably with the pressure on his shoulders after two straight defeats, but I think he boxed well and won comfortably! That being said Franklins stock has definitely gone up after he’s performance. He’s a decent enough fighter I can see some big fights in his future
Awful. Joshua isnt a World Champion anymore. If a fury fight happens it will be his last. He is probably more suited to instagram.
AJ couldnt even knock him out
Fyck I see why avoids fury . This guy wouldn’t even stand a chance with wilder . He’s a very mediocre fighter .
Big guys like AJ are susceptible to the left hook. Franklin doesn't have the style (head movement,high guard)or willingness(?) to get in position to make AJ remember what Ruiz did. I don't recall a solid left hook.
I don’t want to watch AJ any more he is not even in the same league as someone like Andy Ruiz
Watching paint dry is more exciting than this garbage
I got dibs on the winner no joke
Joshua is done. Retire while you can, no longer at the top, but at least able to talk enough to be a comentator
AJ smoked that dude - it blows my mind reading all of the criticisms when he just fought his best fight in many ways, especially in defence.  His new style isn't as flashy but it is way safer and could make him indestructible.
Joshua.. Most over rated fighter.. Boring to watch.. Frustrating fighter.. Got the tools but hasn't got the ability to use them
FURY will pound Joshua!!!!!!!
You can do better AJ, welcome back champ more winnings
England lol
Ever since Aj got hit by Andy Ruiz he has never been the same frightened of being hit unfortunately his punch resistance is not that of other top heavyweights if he gets clipped on the top of the head he’s down and he knows it
AJ fought a nobody to get a win haha should of been training and getting better instead of visiting mecca and supporting mass animal cruelty aka halal
His delicate bubble is well and truly burst,, boring boring
A hard fought win for AJ and credit to him for that. However his performance was somewhat lacklustre with few punch combinations over three at a time and he was disjointed throughout the contest. Difficult to see him outboxing and outthinking Tyson Fury, who has ring craft to spare. I like AJ but after nearly 30 professional fights he has not really progressed much nor realised the huge potential he demonstrated in his early days.  I would not like to see him go in with Wilder, he might get hurt.
He's terrified after being knocked down by Ruiz
So,wie der Boxt wird das nie was werden.Absolut keinen Biss und viel zu zögerlich.Josua von dir hätte ich mehr erwartet.
Wow joshua is amazing! 😂
Bore fight !!
AJ is a joke, no boxing IQ at all. Hopefully the fight with Fury gets made, he'll beat Joshua into retirement, inside 5 rounds imo.
I'm impressed by Jermaine Franklin
Jushua still slow and clumsy, needs to learn aggression if he has to beat Fury or yusik
Aj moves like someone who doesn't know how to box 😂
The most amazing thing is that there are 14 minutes of highlights 😂😂. Big robot springs to mind, give it up 🥱🥱
Thats Boxing??? Katastrophale!
I like the jab
guy is kinda slow... Fury would have no trouble with this dude
joshua is a fraud and always will be
Franklin tired after the 2nd round
Its like all of a sudden AJ forgot the mexican style of boxing and went to a basic 1,2, block boxing. Happy for his return but kinda disappointed at his too safe play of boxing.
AJ looked slow and as basic as they come and he is obviously scared especially of the left hook so much he's flinching I thought he looked like it was all over for him
Taki Lenox Louis by tego Joshue nosem wciągnął i popił herbatką , taka jest prawda
very boring fight
Same old same old! Pedestrian at best with no real ring craft & most importantly no killer instinct
AJ  not in top ten he his done !!
AJ legacy will be remembered forever.... AJ styles
Tune up fight lol
Aj back i must have missed that what a boring fight that was. Hes boring to watch and to be honest he would get sparked by Tyson. Then end of the match showed his true colors pure un sportsmanship.
aj is so overrated need this era of boxing to be over all of them are soft
Don't care 😂
Boooooooooo
Aj looked like a slow version of joe joice needs to find more in next fight...
The most bias commentary I have heard.  They make no comment on any of the work Franklin is doing.  Dreadful
AJ is frightened to throw combos because he's frightened of the counter. He's not top level anymore (if he ever actually was)
AJ isnt 'BACK' franklin isnt on his level
Mejor que pelé nuevamente contra Andy Ruiz sería un mejor espectaculo
AJ is still terrible IMO. He looks a foot taller than Franklin.... if he didn't win it would have been insane. He's also just super boring to watch....
Love anthony so much but seems his time to be over😢
My man doesnt progress...
Congratulations to you AJ
Most biased commentary of all time
От Джошуа ожидалось большего. Неубедительная победа...
Joshua is just like a brick wall,so predictable he would never count with the top 3 that’s ahead of him lol
He looks a better fighter than who Fury just gotta away with fighting. Chizora
Boring fight,
AJ grabbing his head then planting upper cuts he still wouldn't drop illegal move's no point deducted
Mr Governor you people rejected you yes or no? Answer that question don't pretend you didn't hear that question
AJ ist ne richtige Pfeife, nichts druff außer Zahnbelag
WOW!  AJ couldn't even knock out a relative unknown in the boxing world! 🤔
😂
Well done joshua great uppercuts I’d like to see more punches thrown from u though more under hooks hooks over hands body blows u seem to have gone for brute force boxing 🥊 if u decrease some of your muscle mass u will be much much better u are slowing yourself down with all that weight u need to lose 5-10 kg of weight and u will be much faster and not tire out and be way more lethal and productive u are a great fighter your just too bulky man trust me lose some kilos u will be way way better
I mean no doubt aj wud bang me out and I'm just voicing my uneducated opinion but imo aj looks like a droid and the whole ting seemed a tad flat to me . I do think he shud work with someone who could flip that on it head maybe be more fluid...  go train with some shaolin monks for a bit be like water and all that jazz
Ruubish referee, allowing Joshua to hold Franklin's head while punching.
Everyone with a neutral boxing mind knows that franklin wouldnt even survive 4-5 rounds against Wilder. Idk maybe its the right time to retire for AJ
Anthony Joshua's future:  Former champ to JOURNEY MAN
Joshua is overrated. If he can't drop Franklin, he sure isn't going to drop Fury. I don't think he would last 4 rounds with Fury.
🫤
This is Joshua's level
Franklin kinda looks like Deontay
I fell😴🤤 asleep on the fight
Joshua is too slow a fighter to me, can’t compete with the likes of wilder, fury and Joe
I hate when he pulls the opponent's head down to get them into position for an uppercut, he does it in every fight but Usyk didn't let him do it
Joshua is not consistent enough to be a better fighter , in his earlier days he was KO foes out but all of a sudden he blames the trainers for losing , man has 2 or 3 fights a year that not much active,  but he's back now
Joshua n'est pas un boxer. C'est un bodybuilder. Si c'est déjà difficile contre un portier de bar. Je n'imagine même pas la boucherie contre Wilder ou Fury. En fait si. Une blague ! Çà ferait des meme sur tiktok ou Twitch!
borrrrin
I kinda get the impression that Joshua became a boxer because he threw a dart at a wall with a bunch of cards with professional sports written on them. He's an amazing athlete with all the boxing skills that the best coaches could drill into him, and all the boxing instincts of a ballroom dancer that moonlights as a hand model.
Although AJ won the fight, Franklin has way MORE heart as he took some serious shots! What would AJ do against a higher caliber fighter??? Simply have a melt down like last time when he clearly lost against usyk....🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
AJ is back at what? Being boring af? He'll never be champion again.
I thought it was a decent performance by Joshua but he looked very hesitant at times. He could have went for the KO but played it safe. The AJ of 5/6 years ago was never like this
People don’t realize how difficult it is to work an opponent who’s special weapon is a voodoo doll riding the back of his head.
AJ fought a former Warehouse employee for 12 rounds. 😎
Very average, the older heavyweight will be shaking their heads in disbelief soo bad.
Shows just what level aj is at never the same hype train .
Nothing impressive by Joshua the racist. I reckon he’s finished …
Cheap shot at end of the 11th from AJ shows his true character bad performance, Wilder would ko him in a round.
Joshua is heavily over-rated   he should fight Andy . To end his career
Fell asleep watching the highlights....
Матрица Усика походу осталась в голове Джошуа навсегда
AJ won't last 12 rounds with Fury or Usyk !
Back where?
What a boring fight! Joshua wouldn’t stand a chance against wilder let alone fury!!!
Joshua is trash. Not championship material. 😂
Joshua doesn't have this Champ Fire🔥 😮
Can't believe it was ppv.
AJ was a better fighter, and would have knocked down Franklin if not for the consistent clinching.
Well, imo, Joshua is to slow as in do freaking slow. Don't see him competing with them likes of Fury & Wilder in the nearest future.
AJ is not the same anymore.
Trash 🗑️
Aj is Frank Bruno 2 static no movement easy target
even the highlights were boring
AJ seems distracted, his jab is slow, his distance management was bad and his defense was not there
Like watching paint dry, Fury would knock AJ out in 2 rounds.
AJ is back you say? Until he gets knocked out or loses again. I miss the 80’s/90’s boxing myself
Can see the fear in AJ fighting now. Can't take a hit from a cruiserweight, didnt want to clean anyway.
Laboured to a win. I think this shows what level AJs at. He’s clearly peaked.
Josua finished, Frank Bruno would of destroyed him
Boring fight.  Fight wilder
AJ is a proper titan, not sure why he ain't his old self?
I get people want the old knockout AJ but that’s gonna take a long while to get. He’s coming off back to back loses against a great fighter in usyk of course his gonna play it safe. He looked comfortable didn’t panic like usual does. He’s improving a lot . The only thing that annoyed me was the clinching  he needs to cut that to a minimal
Waste of time
Sooooo boring! glad I didn't watch this live. 0 combos from AJ as usual. Only people he puts to sleep are the viewers 😴
Any fury fans looking to slate AJ for not knocking him out… Fury fought Chisora for a 3rd time knowing he’s 39…and couldn’t even drop him lol, Jermaine is a decent fighter and he’s young too…compared to chisora lol anyway it was a unanimous… wasn’t a close fight lol AJ had a bleeding nose that wouldn’t stop alll fight… and that’s because of he obviously damaged it in sparring and was prone to nose bleeds alot more but other then bleeding alot his face is fine… you weirdos
Aj should just quit, he does not have it in him to be a great boxer nor the hunger, poor 12 round performance
Joke ting
Joshua is big homeless boxer.
AJ is just awful. Boring, weak punches, clincher king, point scorer and rigid. Would love Ruiz Jnr. to knock him about again.
I’m sorry i’m a fan of aj always have been think he’s a top guy and yeah he looked better in this fight but this jab jab jab business isn’t enough to take out fury . Although we would all like to see that fight, i’d wish he just hung up the gloves before embarrassing himself any further as fury will blast him apart .
Babying joshua won't help his career and his mindset after his losses from the best.
Joshua still doesn’t have a jab
Wilder will knock AJ out in 2 rounds
Joshua is a fraud 😂😂😂😂
Shut that woman up!!!
they got paid for this?
AJ is pointless now. I don't think anyone cares who he fights.
The commentary and coverage of the fight on dazn last night was embarrassing and awful to watch. Not a single replay of a franklin shot or a word when he landed anything. Commentators getting hyped for simple jabs and talking up AJ like he was ALI in there.   We are supposed to be watching a boxing match not AJ TV. Embarrassing.   Imagine paying for that.
joshuas lack of head movement is going to get him killed
Who’s next ?!!!
Joshua is done out here
You guys are so confusing, when pretty boy Floyd played a safe fight in most of his fights you guys called it Master Class. But when AJ does it and wins it’s an issue? I don’t get it. The man worked behind that left jab and which was impressive because he never had that before he had Franklin caught up a few times, He got hit with some serious shots and took them.
Joshua's got the footwork of frankenstein
Nonsense
how did they find 13 minutes of highlights from this snooze fest
Lame
Next klinchko
Joshua still a great fighter but very slow jab and missing head movements. Fury, Usyk, Wilder another planet. He should fight one of Joyce, Ruiz (both superior in my opinion) or Dubois (the best match up)
@min 12:37 did Joshua's knees buckle from that left jab? or I'm seeing things?
AJ is done, he coulsnt knock out this guy and showed nothing impressive. He wouldnt stand a chance against fury or even wilder.
In what sense is he back? Back in the ring yes.  Back to being AJ the embarrassment after the final bell? Yes   Back to being an unstoppable force... nah mate. Looked scared, didn't use his strengths or advantages. Spent the entire night bleeding like it was his time of the month.  Fail
Well a honest opinion is Joshua is finished now , very poor performance against an average fight . Scared to let punches go scared about getting hit . Chisora would of beet Franklin with his aggression. I think Joshua always been overrated . Unless he gets that anger and passion Joshua won’t win another fight.
Aj slow and boring 💤,  he should retire
🤮🤮🤮🤮
AJ was too slow...
Boring fight. Both scared to let go.
Joshua sorry for you… you not master boxer anymore!!
If Anthony fights wilder he's done i hope he fights him
AJ seems to have become more “One Dimensional” than ever. He seems hesitant to engage. Usyk really did a mind game on him. All that muscle and so little aggression.
Joshua is far too rigid and tight. Signs of a man terrified of taking a hit. What a boring "fight".
Jhezz aj only used his jab didn’t let his hands go
Aj thinks about everything , flow state isn’t there, I have no interest in a fury aj fight, Joe Joyce should be the one to put aj in his final resting place
Joshua still boxing scared. This version of Joshua would not beat the Klitschko of 2016.
Joshua got zero footwork. He trundles around the ring like Frankenstein.
Gak seru ah AJ makin menurun perpomennya, makin lambat, gerakannya
David vs Goliath. What a size difference
AJ please see how you are loved 1million views under 9 hours
If Joshua was a painter he’d be a ‘painting by numbers fighter’ trained at a Technical College, whereas Fury is Vincent van Gogh.  For real boxing I still love watching Mike Tyson fights from 1986 - 1988/1990.
Джошуа все на пенсию Тайсон тебя убет 😊
Joshua is not back, put him against an elite fighter he crumbles
Respect to all fighters who step in the ring but there’s levels to the game and AJ will never be in the same league as Fury and Usyk
I don't consider this win a comeback for joshua..fight wilder
Aj will never be champ again. He's basic, he's also a sore looser and his ego is quickly dieng on him. To push the dude around like that after a fight just goes to show his heads gone.
Joshua appears to be mentally weak....
Get wilder vs AJ , winner fights Fury
Usyk has ruined his career. Dude isn't hungry  anymore.
Joshua really Is a very ordinary fighter as this performance Clearly showed
I respect jush for taking the fight with out a belt.  That is a great welcome back..
AJ just looks afraid in there, doesn’t seem he wants to fight. Could very much see him retiring  after his next real fight. 1-2 disengage/ clinch - this won’t win titles or beat any real contenders…
Love AJ's white pants turned red🥵
Wanted Franklin to win, not a fan of Joshua. Joshua is just wooden muscle bound no mobility. Fury will annihilate him.
He'd get DESTROYED by WILDER 🤐
Joshua is a superb athlete but not a great boxer u fortunately
Would love to see Joshua fight Joyce
same old aj cant move the head too save his life
overated
Joshua moves like train with coal .
Credit to Franklin. AJ still can’t hit anything in front of him. What a waste of time and money. Technically you lost this fight and should retire. There’s nothing inside of AJ to watch anymore. Just like watching Tyson disgrace himself in the early 2000’s
AJ IS BACK! .....P.M.S.L
Franklyn never gave up. Bit more height and might have got him.
boring
Cumbersome and without coordination; paying money to watch Joshua is simply a waste.
Aj's back 😂😂 biggest scam in british boxing
😴
Franklin hasn’t been pro long.The man used to work part time in a warehouse. Props to him for how far he has come. Hopefully this payday will help his family. May gods light shine on you brother ❤
USELESS AS EVER
AJ won every one of those 12 rounds.   It's called strategy and sticking to the plan even with a broken nose.  If you can't respect that you know nothing about the sport.
I miss Lennox 😢
Lawan Franklin yg lemah aja sampai 12 round,gimana kalo ketemu Tyson furry.... hancur tuh Antoni Josua
AJ is no longer a title contender
AJ is back from where?? Hospital
Aj not the same anymore
We want JOSHUA VS WILDER AND USYK VS FURY PLS!!!
Aj moves like a wooden plank
Is back 🤣🤣🤣
Back we're king off the frauds
AJ should have a rematch contract with wilder,
Usyk or Fury smokes this AJ with ease
I’ve never been so bored in my life, I turned it off after 2 rounds n watched YouTube. UFC is just so much better..
Makes you pleased you haven't paid to watch it, can't help feeling sorry for the poor sapps that shelled out to go and see it.
Amazing, si amazing, it gonna be the match of the year
were people not watching the fight it was such a let down on that performance he wont beat either fury or wilder
I like this Joshua more, seems like he became more technical and fluent. When he'll be getting in tune with this technical side more and his beast power it will be amazing.
AJ wins but no statement and very little excitement
Anyone remember the days of Lenox Lewis? 😴
Антон Джошуа,за тебя болела вся Украина❤❤❤❤🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Joshua is an accident on n waiting, made his cash and should just retire
AJ won't be filling stadiums anytime soon. The guy is overrated, immobile and only goes for strength. I stopped watching the fight after round 6, just watched King of Queens and I've seen King of Queens 100 times :)
Why is Joshua so scared and box like little girl. Borin!
Bof bof  ...
AJ is a level just above White and nowhere near Fury 😂
Joshua from 3 or 4 years ago would have beaten the gypsy king. But like this, i don't think so.
Different style by Aj..Improved
I don’t think boxing is Joshuas natural sport really. I reckon he’d have been a better rugby or basketball player
Joshua needs to use his reach better. Relax a bit, and stretch the jab more often. Lennox was great and one of the reasons was that he knew how to use the jab.
The more i watch these people the more i realise how bang average fury truly is , he is the best amongst a bunch of clowns
fell asleep watching the highlights
What a boring fight.. I would have been really upset if I paid for this to watch.
I am surprised that Little British p🍒y has won... 😮
Disappointed by how Joshua fights he won't beat a serious heavyweight fight
Joshua ❤❤❤❤❤
Joshua should go and rest Abeg
Slow, boring, methodical, predictable, no chin, no gas in the tank after a few rounds or a couple of blows. What a mug & a fake this guy has turned out to be. Well done Eddie for making a fortune off of him.
The  champ is back. Great fight. Franklin is a tough guy.  Congratulations AJ.
Well that was boring by AJ. He didn’t take any risks and never looked like getting a stoppage. I reckon Fury would have a field Day on him.
This guy gets so much undeserved hate. Proper boxer that doesn't back out of a challenge. More respect for a fighter that fights and loses than one that makes every excuse not to fight and holds up the decision. No names.... 👀
Bro fight this dude 12 rounds?😆
Joshua inefficient
Ffs who wants to watch 2 heavyweights hug for half a fight?
Clearly, AJ's time is over .
Am Nigerian but I must say that Joshua made the fight look so unentertaining. So boring. He won out of luck not skills
He's just to predictable. I think he should finish now . He's overachieved really. Time to hang them up Joshua is now petrified of getting dropped, mechanical over cautious and very very predictable.
😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
AJ  always turns up in great shape, trains hard etc but ultimately he's just an average boxer. Extremely mechanical & he looks as if he's lost that desire. He's also 1 stone overweight. Why carry all that extra weight, if I ain't gonna use it. Terribly boring fight.
Very very bed fight
He isn’t the same fighter his confidence looks shattered for someone with the speed and power, I still don’t understand why he’s trying to box instead of fight. That’s how he made his name
Joshua is to robotic no head movement no jab don't sit on his punches gun shy fury would absolutely destroy him
Obviously a lot of people have a opinion but I thought AJ didn’t  look tired for the first time in years and the jab was bsck liked it like he said and many will say knock out is great but winning is proven winner if he does what passed champions have done he will be champion again there wasn’t a moment he got caught abd looked panicked he tied him up I like what he’s done loads to fine june but he had his bleeding nose in the warm up so that takes some energy out of your body but I fought a ducking awkward fighter respect
Explosive fight
Has there ever been a more ponderous, lethargic boxer in history ? Joshua should be eternally grateful for getting to the position he's in. He's a very lucky man.
Great improvements from AJ on his jab. His defense is improved a little but could be very exposed against a better opponent.
For me I don't see Joshua going forward, he can't beat Tyson furry, that's impossible
More Dele alli than Muhammad Ali !!
AJ is back? This was of the most boring fights I seen since Vladimir was boxing ffs AJ couldn’t even take out Franklin and all Franklin did from the 6th round on was try to cuddle AJ. Pathetic. AJ is definitely 100% washed up
Great win from J.D
Joshua's main defence was clinching
Unimpressive from Joshua. Try Fury or Usyk
Joshua looks slow against any decent fighter he can be exposed
pretty boy doesnt like getting hit
tune up of all tune up
Great Respect to both. For Franklin the Tyson Stile would feet perfect. AJ should check the Sowjetstyle of footwork. His position looks uncomfortable and this makes him slower.
joshua got paid nuff said, thats all it was a picked fighter for a bloke who is all washed up
How u gonna have an English ref doing a english fighter wouldnt be allowed in football
What a joke of a ref. AJ kept punching in the clinch while holding back of the head multiple times, ref does nothing.  AJ throws sucker punch while the "ref" is seperating the clinch, ref goes "whell, what can you do mate". Absolute disgrace
The look and Joshua’s face makes me think he no longer enjoys the sport he doesn’t have the fire he once had
Is back for what!? Fury would destroy him within 8 rounds.
This is an Easy fight for Joshua if he pushed himself more harder.His Performance against Klitschko was very Amazing.He just need more movement and more combination.
It was an acceptable performance but you wouldn't think Joshua was, until recently,  a "unified champion". You also have to ask how Joshua would do against Whyte, now.
Si amazing, congratulations joshua
hes back
Joshua seemed so scared, stiff and rigid against a much inferior opponent. Don't know what's going on mentally but I don't think he's ever coming back to win a world title.
This was mad boring, I can't finish it
Bro he’s the same after the usyk fight he’s to robotic if anything he’s worse here
I'm afraid to say, AJ has become a mid-division fighter at best.  Flattered in his early career with lots of knockouts, culminating in the Klitch victory, after the Ruiz loss, he's now past his peak and there's no way on God's green earth will he ever get to the lofty heights of his heyday.  I foresee a few more of these types of fights against willing & upcoming opponents, until the younger man, becomes the better man, beats him and AJ goes on to be the businessman he dreams about becoming.  The writing is on the wall for AJ and that writing says: The end is nigh.
Zesikałem się z emocji!
Glad I didn't spend money to watch this. Joshua is again afraid to let his hands go. He has never recovered mentally from that first fight with Ruiz. I was a big Joshua fan, but it is difficult to escape the conclusion that he's done at the highest level. He's so slow and so static and afraid to commit, which neutralises his best weapons. On this showing, Fury would humiliate him. And then knock him out.
lol
On a more serious note, if AJ fights this way he stand no chance with the current heavyweights. This is not a bodybuilding contest, he needs to put up classic fighting styles; this can’t help him at all. He’s so afraid.
Joshua looked so stiff out there, he needs to go back to the style that made him a unified champ.
Big respect to both 🤎 Congrats Josh✊
You cant drop a tree from the top - chop down the tree with real serious thumping jabs to that core and sternum.
AJ is extremely hesitant against smaller fighters, you can see why given his track record against them. I genuinely think AJ V Fury will be closer than people think.
AJ is like a walking boxing bag, was expecting you more sharpness from him
Franklin at this moment is sure better than Dillian Whyte. Who robbed in the fight against him.
If these are the highlights ,I’m glad I didn’t pay for this .
Congratulations our own man Anthony
AJ dont need the money should just walk away looked nervous he is massive speed power should just go back to when he first turned pro just knocking psople out he has lost that killa instincts will never get back on top anyway who has he really fought an aging klitscko lost to ruiz lost twice to usyk walk away
Boring...... AJ was more scared of losing than anything. His time is over.
Aj will always struggle against fighters that have foot and head movements like Usyk or Andy Ruiz. They keep him thinking all the time and he gets tired and confused..
🔴Ferrari No.1 always
Franklin by far the better boxer he was on a pay day not to knock the meal ticket out  , Joshua is done my friends he needs to walk away from boxing I don't want to say it but he's going to end his career badly,  people like Fury will rip the heart out of gym boxers like Anthony,  he's achieved so much and no shame when there's better out there. All the best A.J.
слабенький бой, как то Энтони мало бьёт.
I like the new Joshua
What a dull boring fight, Joshua just doesn't have it anymore and Tyson would take him apart within three rounds
There are so many head coaches here in the comment section,from your comments you should all be the heavyweight champions instead,look at how social media made people so comfortable with senseless criticism,most of you can’t even jog for 4 minutes or know how to wear boxing gloves yet you seem to know what AJ or his coach should have done,phew!!!!!
We don't see too many half decent HWs from the States these days but Franklin is a credible opponent. Joshua never seems to opt for an easy option unlike Messrs Fury and Wilder.  Joshua seems to have lost his explosive aggression since Ruiz I but his conditioning seems to have improved.
Square on. One robotic step forward. Single jab. Eyes off opponent and looking at the ref after every break. It's like AJ's just switched to boxing from karate!
Aj needs to revert to the style and attitude he had before hearn got involved ever since he lost the ruiz fight he's been cagey, too robotic and moving stiff on the back foot
AJ be looking so nonchalant. Seems Ruiz has knocked out that killer mentality
It was more interesting watching Franklin
Awful.
AJ is back?.. I thought it will be a huge KO in the - 3-4th round :D, but beating a much smaller guy on points, AJ lookes like has not got as much spark as before.
AJ stiff as a lamp post. No movement.
Welcom Coming Swiss 🥊
If Joshua is  expecting to take on fury, he should have been able to knockout this guy within 5 rounds. He’s not ready to fight fury.
vs. who?
He’s back 😂
No doubt AJ was the better boxer but huge respect to Franklin. AJ not looking like a WC
AJ IS BACK??? okey so first of all nice spoiler .... another thing this fight had to be AJ in like 5-6 rounds, I think odds for under 6.5 rounds was 1.85, but franklin being smaller , less experienced stayed in fight for 12 rounds... and u saying AJ IS BACK? lol AJ is far away from the top of the mountain . Franklins only win is against some 40years old guy, who fought after 14years break (jail time I guess) so this fight had to be AJ in like 3-4 rounds, but he has such a small brains (as we saw in USYK fight) that I dont see him being champion ever again :)
Joshua is so bad at boxing. I've no idea what anyone sees in his boring cumbersome fights.
The HW division is weak. Franklin is decent but has nothing special about him.   He gave Joshua the robot a tough fight lol
Well done Joshua ✊🏿
Aj needs to get the eye of the tiger back
Don’t let him bully you son !!!
This is not that Anthony Joshua which we saw in Takam/Martin/Parker Fights..
This video didn't need to be 13 minutes... Wasn't that much going on.  5 mins tops
Joshua is finished  he’s couldn’t even stop this road sweeper. Too worried about getting one on the glass chin to throw anything
He was lucky anybody else would have dropped him he hasn’t got it in him
Hero worship commentary.  On the radio you wouldn’t know Franklyn landed a punch…
Joshua 👎
He's still slow and being bullied into a corner by a little man. He seem not to know when to throw counter punches, hence, he doesn't seize moments.
Anthony “man of peace” Joshua….what an embarrassing performance against a really ordinary opponent
I m not happy the way he win ,,
People notice that Antony Joshua trying to transform into Klitschko using his tactic. But it's not Klitschko style, it's Steward's style. Both Lewis and Klitschko do the same. And if AJ wants to be on the top he must do the same. But he needs time for this transformation
he has a new coach but looks as slow as ever and no movement  the guy is flat footed  static...for someone supposed to be so athletic there is nothing there
L I M P
BORING
I think it has something to do with a female/love interest why AJ is no longer the fighter he was. Something we may never get to know so many men deal with
Josh your becoming  the New  Audley harrison  youll slog on for years after fury wilder whyte usyk  retire etc ...just to prove your point .. youve been beaten by a chubby tough mexican and its frankly over hang em up take the money and live happily a new venture awaits Quit whilst still dignified
Fury WinJoshua   winWilder Joshua 1000%
AJ dont look the same
Aj what’s happened man.. a fat Mexican started this ay
Joshua - floats like a robot and stings like a butterfly.  He will probably get an offer to star in a Transformers movie.
AJ didn’t deserve that win- time to retire!!
Aj looks like he got the yips
I would hardly say aj is back. He looks a shadow of his former self
By back, do you mean just as poor as before? AJ is done, the first time he fights a joyce, wilder, fury or usyk he gets destroyed.
Franklin looks like a cruiserweight🧐
11:54 sound 😮
Congratulations 🏆 champ 🏆 more win
I do understand it's not easy competing at the highest level in  boxing, but I think he has a glass jaw and telegraph's his punches. Compared to the days of Muhammed Ali and Mike Tyson, present day heavy weight boxing is just hype.
I wonder if AJ has lost the passion to win?? He seems hesitant and doesn't have that movement anymore. I can't seem him beating anyone for a belt.
AJ isn't back. AJ has left the building and he just proved it. Should try and make some big money fights now on his way out.
Franklin looks like a tough guy. Didn't allow himself to get knocked out
It's easy to fight a person who stands square in front of you and brawls than a person that moves and throws combinations from angels. That was a set up fight, manz oni the ends still don't rate you AJ
Real boxing died a long time ago 😴😴😴😴
Joshua it was bad
2 bums. AJ be a journeyman soon
Credit to Joshua he's a decent fighter 😜
No way this would have gone to 12th had he been facing Wilder
Aj is fortunate to be a big guy. He has no skill. Just sits behind his jab.
Boring af
This fight prove that AJ  he is not Knock out  puncher 🤣🤣🤣🤣 easy fight for fury and wilder  and the last fought that he lost 🤣🤣🤣
Boring fight this was lol
Best part of this  fight was after the BELL
Wilder, Joyce, Miller, Whyte dismantle AJ no problem, and as for a fight with Fury, that would be very bad for AJ's long term health.
I see you edited out the Joshua attack on Franklin at the end of the fight
A Fury or a Wilder will destroy AJ, based on this performance.
Tyson furry  will knock  AJ out  I'm afraid to say if they get a fight.
Aj is back? With this performance? If anything he is  not even a former shadow of himself. If he enters the.ring with this mindset and skill sets, fury, wilder will gobble him up within the first 3 or 4 rounds. He is not back, he is gone.
Joshua is still so flat footed. He should be shuffling in and out the pocket.
Joshua just DOESN'T have what's really needed at this level!! Fury would DESTROY him!!
Joshua had a decent fight...but there's a lot to be desired when it comes to his foot work
The was too much wrestling 😅, to be frank, AJ must improve his performance although we won I wasn't impressed. Congratulations on the win ✌️✊💪
Franklin will give ALOT of heavyweights problems.... Trust me.... Especially stiff ones with little movement that's where AJ struggled. He can take a punch and he's got them Ruiz hands 👀 👀
with that performance,,i doubt theres a fighter out there that fears AJ.
I didn’t even know this was happening. Boxing is seriously in trouble when it comes to marketing
AJ needs to avoid Wilder, whyte, and Fury, hes done
If i could make concrete as stiff as AJ i would be a rich man.
Congratulations to AJ. However, didn't seem impressive to me.
Next Joy Joyce
Fury would absolutely clown aj
Joshua might be the most overrated athlete in sports. He’s an average heavyweight at best
These commentators are obviously pro AJ that was clear as day.
Джошуа сила. Как приятно смотреть было этот бой. И впринцыпе все бои с Антохой
Boring
Guys the match was done at 10th round mistakenly the referee left this going ,was like PlayStation game Franklin was just hanging around, absorbing heavy shots obviously was a total mess
Highlights?  For 13 minutes?  This video has more padding than Tyson Fury.
Aj is very terrible
title should be jermain franklin vs Cyril gane😂😂
2 bums fighing
Looks like Franklin wasn't the Tomato can that Eddie needed to feed Aj after all. Well Played Franklin. Don't know where Aj goes from here.  Whyte? Chisora? Or does he Get fed to Joe Joyce?
Back lol was embarrassing he is finished the likes of Fury and Wilder would finish him off easy needs to retire back LOL looked scared after the beating he got from Usyk
Beetroot salad wins fights
ДЖОШУА МОЛОДЕЦ
This guy just fought a guy way smaller with much less reach and let's me real way way way less competitive experience and you guys titled this "Anthony Joshua is back" back to what being mediocre AF? Stop this right now. I think he should be the one to fight Francis 🤦🏿🤷🏿‍♂️
Aj exposed again,he's british are title at best
I can see a bright future for franklin now he was deffo the star of this fight. a very tough fighter indeed
Geleceğin sampiyonu Anthony ✊💪🔥❤️
AJ isn't back. I'm afraid he will never return to his former glory he's petrified. Franklin out boxed him for the majority until later rounds. Fury, Usyk will dance around him all night whilst boxing his head off. Even wilder has better movement and punch variety, and that's saying something 😂.
Boring..
Andy Ruiz
ANDY RUIZ
Heh, both Wilder or Fury will destroy him in 3-4 rounds
AJ should retire😂
He can't beat white again, if he move the head,hands are locked,this guys he's got everything but he need to loosen his hands or arms ,and he's toll ,he must not come down to the level of the opponent.he must stay there Toller,and try to defend himself other way or Floyd style of defence.
Aj descent fighter but wont win against the big boys
Tengo 3 meses entrenando y mido 1.8 mts y peso 108 kgs,  pero siento que si le pongo los golpes a joshua. Pega muy quedito.  Aún dejando que me golpee. No me hace nada. Soy más ágil y con más potencia.
Aj fought like he was unsure of himself
Didn’t even realise this fight was on otherwise I’d of spent my night avoiding it
Always aj haters franklins a soldier he would give every1 trouble FACTS aka you cant ko every1 research the greats toooooo many part timers on here joe joyce gonna be a REAL FIGHT member aj ko him in 1 round
AJ just wears you down out of sheer boredom.
Anthony is a class act and Gernaine was a tough guy. Respect to both of them 😊
BIEN
Franklin can fight 💯
AJ is so robotic
AJ’s back- back to beating nobodies!! GG
Einfach nur langweilig...🥱
Anthony Joshua is not back untill he defeats tyson fury or usyk  or deontay wilder
Franklin has too go in top 10
Joshua rabbit punches too much no points taken… No disrespect but I think a slightly better coach could’ve gotten Franklin the win, he possessed slightly better skill or at least footwork imo… GGs..
Man those shorts
El miedo no anda en burro verdad Joshua
Joshua need to put down weight he is sloppy
Después de 3 años todavía le tiene miedo a ANDY RUIZ.
Heavyweight division is pathetic. Slow, ponderous, laboured. Most of the fight in a wrestle / clinch. And lets wait a year for a fight.
AJ looks like a youtube boxer tbh 😂😂😂
People saying Joshua looked scared to lose, I don't agree at all it's just his defence looked much better.
Gompecitos débiles de Joshua. Contra la potencia de ANDY RUIZ.
Joy joice would ko him easly
Come in career heaviest..... To box like that . AJ still not mentally recovered from those losses they are firmly in his head in thst fight . Disappointing performance
El robot joshua tiene miedo  de ANDY RUIZ
Terrible fight AJ is too wooden with no head movement Wilder will kO him inside 3 rounds and Fury will beat him up for 7-8
On that showing fighting a man half his size who's KO record is poor nothing to worry those at the top.
Usyk and Ruiz cracked Joshua. He needs to gain confidence and forget about the pressure
Que paso con la 3er pelea contra ANDY RUIZ
Ruiz next please
Looks like Joshua is trying to learn boxing all over . Can see him thinking about his technique as he throws, no fluidity. He should retire.
ANDY RUIZ esta viendo.
Judges probably scared to give it to Franklin incase AJ threw a tantrum again!!
No te hagas pato...payo.... ANDY RUIZ
He boxed well, but im not sure 12 round decisions are what is going to build his confidence back up, he needs to taste blood again. Spark whyte out in the summer and he can start getting back into it
No le tengas miedo a ANDY RUIZ.
Terrible fighter Joshua is, basically a amateur poor boxing skills to upright no lateral movement didn't use his jab with authority... Poor display, like against ruiz had height and reach advantage but did not take advantage of it????. Will get severely schooled if he fights fury...
Flat footed. Barely any movement. Big target for Fury to pepper. Wilder knocks him out within 5.
ANDY RUIZ??????
AJ is not the some really ,he wine very week
No te escondas....de ...ANDY RUIZ
They are both so stif in the ring is amazing they are ranked so high. Usyk or Fury can play with both at the same time .Wilder will beat them hands down .
The AJ we got to love is gone now I think it’s down to the way he’s taking to few fights per year before he had the belts he was fighting 3-5 times a year but only 2-3 fights after he won the belts that will show him up and it has for fighting fit if he doesn’t get back to fighting 3-5 times a year he will never win the championship again it’s like a football player who is fit at the start of the season but not match fit they need game time to get match fit it’s the same in any sport
I want to see wilder vs Joshua.
Johsua, te habla ANDY RUIZ
Kampf d3r homos Langeweile pur
Franklin, the undisputed world hugging champion
What do you mean AJ is back? If AJ was back this wouldn’t have gone past 7 Blight on his record in my opinion
I liked that Joshua was still going for a knockout in 12th round instead of playing safe, even though he was clearly winning the fight.
It's a sad state of affairs, when we watch Fury for knock-outs and AJ to prance about the ring for 12 rounds.  Can anyone tell me the point in his extra weight?  Surely his style of fighting, would suit being 1 1/2 st lighter?  AJ fights are now the boring affairs that were afforded to Fury.  I honestly dont want those two to meet, for the first time in their careers.  The mopst exitement i watched on that fight, last night, was for 1 min in round 10 and after the 12th had finished!
AJ is not as flexible as before
How many times does AJ wanna get away with holding franklins head down and still getting in the punches
JOSHUA IS SCARED . HE DOESN'T HAVE THE HEART AND STYLE TO THROW DECENT PUNCHES .
Looks like it was a boaring fight.
I saw just two rounds boxing 10 an 12
He kept hold of the back of his head every time Franklin got close.
If that's what you call being back then he won't be back for long
Joshua ain't the same again....
No way he is beating the top 3
Joshua should fight Fury….Tommy I mean not the big brother!
Never seen such a big man be so meek. His mind is not that of a fighter. With that physique he should be demolishing everyone in front of him, but his mind holds him back. Imagine Mike Tysons brain in that body.
Sorry but Joshua doesn’t have it anymore, could see the panic in his eyes every round.
When you say he is back I was expecting a KO. Decision win is not a comeback statement
AJ career done! even if he won aint noway back my broski!!
AJ’s back 😂 AJ is right down the pecking order
AJ is half the fighter he used to be. Compare this fight with the raw unit of a bloke that fought against Dillon Whyte
booring
Haha about 200 people attended
And frankly have made it through.... 🤣😛😜🤪😝😁😆😂
AJ is back lol Let's be real it was a very lacklustre performance. Franklin looked like he wanted it more than Joshua. At least half the top 10 heavyweights would put AJ on the floor, he's finished at top level.
Wilder will make Joshua an easy job ..
2:36
весьма посредственно..еле Франклина одолел...куда там выше рыпаться...
I think Creed III guy will khill both of these guys😅
Скучный
Supper boring fight...
Aora revancha con 😅😅😅
The white Shorts were the BEST Idea..
Boring as usual from Joshua , I had to keep on fast forwarding looking for something exciting . He'll never fight Tyson because of the humiliation of defeat .
I was a huge fan of AJ.  He should retire. A shadow of his former self. No jab. He's gone
He's Back? pssssssh 👎👎🤣🤣
Slow,laboured an sluggish no way AJ gets the fury fight after that display of robotics 🤖
Aj don’t be fighting nobody
Personally I think Joshua should look for a new job he’s so boring to watch. He reminds me of the robocop character
It takes a middleweight to beat AJ!😉
You are MAD for saying AJ’S back…definitely lost your mind if he hasn’t…Shambolic…Never ever getting those Belts back😅😅
I am confused as to which round they thought Joshua won what a fix Franklin won every round hands down
That was an embarrassment, fury would punish him, so would Joyce. people keep making excuses for AJ, He will never be a world champ again. All the hangers on are just rinsing the last bit of money out of him, fact.
Should of been a breeze aj ain’t nothing
Joshua was awful ,from a Joshua fan. Needs to hang them up after that
Joshua has always been in trouble against short, agile boxers. I think he should change coaches who can change his fighting style.
AJ holding Hermaine back of the head too many time , don't like that !
Last time I saw foot work that bad from an ex belt holder I was at the clown convention and Mr Bobo had just had his spine fused the week before.
12 rounds ffs 🤦🏼‍♂️ 😂😂😂
Ну так он Усика не побьет, это точно!!
A lot of Americans come over here for the payday. Hand on heart Franklin is not one of them guys. The height and reach had the advantage but seriously think Franklin could cause a problem for a few guys over here
AJ is definately not back
Joshua does not look great
Boxing really wanted to make Joshua the face of boxing, he had the look but just didn’t have the talent needed to carry the sport… now throw him to wilder cause that’s the fight we wanted.
He wants to take notice of his mum, and retire. Peace be unto you.
Thanks for quick upload. AJ would not have survived the first round against a prime Mike Tyson. He didn't stand around waiting to be hit.
Anthony Joshua has a therapeutic use exemption' if you do not know what that is, you probably think boxing is not corrupt.
They gave Joshua an easy opponent. Welcome to boxing.
AJ looked apprehensive,  nervous and slow, he just isn’t loose enough and his confidence has deserted him. A real contender would have had the much smaller Franklin out of there in Two or Three rounds. On this performance I wouldn’t say that AJ is back,I’d say that he is clearly on his way out. He is in my opinion the man that never was.
Managing to eek out 13 minutes of “highlights”. Great job.
Back? Back to what? 😂 dudes completely finished based on last night.
Ohhh poor AJ it is time to hang out those gloves boy,  you can see the fear in his body reactions and eyes, please for the sake of you life never go against Wilder or Fury
AJ reminded me of Frank Bruno in this fight but I've just had a quick recap of some of Franks fights and he had more in his armoury than I remember. Maybe the same power as AJ but Frank certainly went into fights with a more determined mind set. AJ is too concerned with what his corner thinks during the rounds. He keeps looking over as if saying 'what shall I do? He has the tools, but just needs to have faith himself.
Why is he wearing a skirt instead?
AJ looks frightened to death of getting clipped 🤣 😂 AJ is finished!
Confidence building 12 rounds for Joshua and fair play to Franklin, but I think Joshua is still afraid to open up as his previous losses are still on his mind. Who knows how he will overcome them, but Fury Fight is a long way off for Joshua at the moment.
Think DAZN have backed the wrong horse tbh. Aj looks finished with boxing
Expected a better display from AJ
AJ still looks shy and slow in the ring despite the huge size difference. I can't see him beating anyone at the top end of the division
AJ seems scared for someone of his physical stature. Compare him to the smarts of Ali, the strength of Foreman etc and he doesn't seem to hold a candle to any of them and he wouldn't last a round with them. He should be dictating the pace but it's the opposite here. Never got out of first gear.
One KO in five years. AJ was always a paper champion. Fury would destroy him. All those fanboys "He'll knock Fury out" AJ was never the champion you thought he was. Going 12 rounds with the likes of Joseph Parker does not a legend make. Eddie Hearn will protect his cash cow, as usual, be sure to tune into Whyte v AJ next. Dangerous fight that for AJ. Fury is two leagues above AJ, he always was, but since Sugar Hill, Fury can dominate off the front foot. AJ's only got three problems, his feet, his hands and his brain. Apart from that he's fine....
Respect to boxers I've watched forever but the mma world is sooooo much more entertaining these days. By a mile
AJ is not back, this is not the old AJ
I can't believe I wasted my Saturday night watching this guy lightly spar again....   he fights scared
AJ hasnt changed much, still  touched and not quite accurate, number of shots and combos missed target, jab improved!
Embarrassing that it took 12 rounds to beat that hobbit
Joshua was holding dude by the back of the neck and uppercuting a whole a lot. Joshua ain't the same fighter he used to be
Fan boys 🛑 AJ is done he will never be the boxer he once was. Ruiz has effected him and maybe AJ thinks negative comments are a from Haters. But I can honestly say this is my opinion and I'm  ot hating .. I think he's done he's not throwing like he used to and its because of what Ruiz did to him. AJ is making his fights complicated when it is simple hit and hit hard thats what AJ was about before. Jf is a journey man credit to him but he's a journey man he got smashed by wilder and seriously if AJ fights wilder wilder puts him to sleep in round 5
Aj so boring
Joshua is the Chelsea of this season 🤣
This klitschko style is boring, you can even sleep watching it. This is not boxing.
Watch AJ is like watching England play football 🤦🏻‍♂️ it’s so frustrating
GREAT FIGHT CHAMP ITS NOT ALL ABOUT K.O FAM !! FIGHT SMART 🔥🔥🔥WE ON..👊🏽
AJ take your time and ease back in to world title fights I think this performance is not as bad as the critics are making out
fut un temps où l'exploit était de tenir le plus longtemps face à AJ. Aujourd'hui l'exploit de AJ est de tenir le plus longtemps face à ses adversaires pour que l'on puisse lui lever le bras 😢.
Anthony "The AJ" Joshua has no upper body movement and is too static. His feet and hands are quick enough though. Anyway, the fight between Fury and Usyk has fallen through so Fury should fight Joshua and just get it done.
I am glad I turned it off for Match Of The Day ☺️
Not a great performance from Joshua.... But I did like the cheeky little slap he gave Franklin at the end of the fight😂
Joshua really isn't a great heavyweight.
Joshua can only box with Marko Huck😂
Even the highlights are booooooooooooooring. AJ tactics are waiting his oponent fall to sleep i guess.
AJ ❤️🙏🤲❤️🫡
Me thinking: 'lovely uppercut from franklin.  Then immediately after  Commentators ; wonderful uppercut from Joshua'   Eh?
He try be like Vl. Klichko, but no, he is not...
Next should be either trilogy with Ruiz or fight with Wilder. AJs quickest path back to the top would be to take out one of those two. That said I think he loses both by KO. Unless Ruiz comes in morbidly obese again. If he shows up like he did against Luis Ortiz then it's a wrap. Against Wilder he goes to sleep no matter what.
Huge difference in size.
AJ so stiff and looked worried/scared, Usyk damaged him ore what is going on..?
no time for AJ he is nothing but a racist... been exposed to many times now. He will never get them belts back....
Qatar Airways ✌️ 🇶🇦 ✌️ 🇶🇦 ✌️ 🇶🇦 ✌️ 🇶🇦 ✌️
What a load of poo 💩
Joshua fights now like the England football team play: scared too lose rather than a hunger to win.
We may never see AJ  WIN by KO anymore
AJ with the T-Rex arms...   thats fear
Joshua absolutely has an uppercut and fiery keeps his head in a meat grinder a long time I'm not saying anything obviously I favor fiery all day but it could be something to watch Tyson is an exceptional Talent one of the best heavyweights just caught and kind of a Down era but did take care of the klitschkos with love to see him fight Alexander
AJ looks just like some kind of AI boxer. Just too robotic and not reactive enough. Not a brawler or a fighter. Just he’s so strong and powerful that he’s got away with it for so long.
Can see why Fury ducked Usyk, bigger pay day and much easier fight with Joshua
Boring fight
Congratulations AJ 🇬🇧! Number 1.👌🏾
Joshua is only marketing, he has no heart, he is more of a bodybuilder than a fighter. Bored fights.
WASTE OF TIME
Joshua lost his mojo around the Joe Parker fight where he was so determined to try and become an Ali like ultimate fighter instead of sticking to his strengths which was being a knockout artist at the time and hasn't been convincing since and lost the confidence to swing for the fences
2 fights back Jermaine was working in a factory!!.... AJ back? 😂😂
Bag of shyt
Joshua looks tight not relaxed. I don't see him as a natural fighter. He is just a big lump of muscle 💪 trying to fight. Not a natural killer. If he knew how to fight and had confidence he would destroy everyone. He is the most athletic boxer. Just too self contained.
Antonis Joshua is the best!!!!!
Aj he must  change  spor better  play ping pong or ballet!!!!!!
AJ don't have the fight in him anymore
Dirt
AJ just doesn’t have the heart of a fighter. I don’t see a fire to win in him. Just feels like he’s trying to uphold a image.
Joshua holding his neck alot
Joshua does not fight at all on the inside. Outside boxing is fine but there is an art to fighting inside as well.
AJ is finished!
🤓AJ was surprised by the decision…respect to Franklin!👊🏽
Back where???like franklin more
He just doesn't have that thing like Fury or those elites, I don't know the word for it. Shawn Porter called it "The Quan" when talking about Bud Crawford, when they know the sport inside out and can just make it up on the spot, that creativity can turn chaos into art. AJs world level, achieved alot and deserves respect 🙌 🦁
D NA of Crimson All~Iva DA SCene
Sounds like the crowd was all kids or girls.
AJ has reached his peak and isn't going to get any better. He's boxing just as stiff as he always has and clearly hasn't trained with any new techniques since his losses to Ruiz and Usyk. His stiff boxing was fine in his first 25 fights because his reasonably big power shots got him through them. But lately, he's been up against more versitile boxers which is why he's now lost quite a few and he's been unable to properly finish this above average boxer. He was lucky to be a champion when he got the belt and was in the right place at the right time. But inevitably, that was going to be removed from him and it was. If AJ goes up against Joe Joyce, Joe Joyce is a similar fighter to AJ but isnt as stiff and has just as much power. Joe will certainly destroy him. And Wilder? AJ will come back in a body bag.
top man tony dune well
Joshua is a big strong guy but very stiff. Is not a killer like Tyson. He is like manufactured not natural.
A positive performance from AJ. The Wilder fight has to come next
😂😂😂😂😂 Joshua 👎👎👎👎
AJ has a lack of respect for his opponents ,this leaves him vulnerable and open. I think when he fought the Russian he was very respectful but he became over confident and can't get back to his old self where he outshines his opponents
Franklin has to move his head, his trainer was yelling the same instruction the whole fight! lol
Could Joshua be the most boring heavyweight boxer?
AJ is like a scared dog..hiding his tail n between his legs, he forgot how to box..just look at his foot works, his jabs no longer have stings
12 rounds to beat this chump.- Big dosser
Not convinced with the performance 😢AJ
Franklin had somewhat similar idea for fighting as Usyk. When hit badly, might as well make a charge. Either you get knocked out or you make a decent counter attack to stop the opponents advancement.
Great fight. Joshua is on Doe legs for right now, he's a little unsteady but focused. Joshua is learning a new approach to fighting so he's going to look tentative but you could see the difference in his approach, his defense was a lot better and he stayed focused. He didn't look like he was trying to figure anything out just follow a game plan. Joshua will have to relocate to the USA if he wants to get the full benefit of training from James! Tighter defense will prevent him from getting hit with shots.
AJ is back…….. fighting low level 3rd tier bums where he belongs. Fake boxer.
Should be done for fraud for calling that a fight
Joshua is the Benjamin Button of boxing.  Looks like he's getting worse not better.  You can see the anxiety and tension in him still.
AJ having life or death fights with average opponents. Wilder or Fury, Joyce, even Whyte, these guys would destroy AJ right now. Big stiff, and Bellew is a spastic joke
Anthony. No precision No speed.After you with better boxers
joshua jsut doesnt have it
Boringgg
Awful fight AJ and Eddie picked a safe fight and they even made it look difficult Franklin could hold a punch but he wasn’t a threat throwing one
Yeah aj the exposec one is back fighting unkowns he can't even hurt. Nothing exciting.
Joshua couldn't even beat him early. Yeah he's done. Let's not drag this out any longer. To even think of Tyson is laughable. Go get your bodybuilding pro card. Your boxing career is a meme
AJ is finished, he looks scared
Joshua boxed carefully and smartly. ...gone 12 rounds with that all weight.
РЕГРЕС Джошуа очевидний...
😴 😴
Aj don't loom comfy till 7/8th that when he always looks he's best
What a boring fight ..AJ is the worst heavy weight I've seen ...painful watch again 90s heavy weights would have mowed down the likes of AJ without sweating ..absolutely garbage  🚮
People saying joshua is washed because there’s no knockout etc, he’s with a new trainer after one camp. Can very much tell it was a different AJ tonight, calculated with his shots and controlled the ring throughout, defensively was sound too
👎🏾
a picked opponent for a scared fighter. Glad that Warwick Davis was free that night.
AJ, is not sure of himself no believe at all. AJ, being the bigger and experienced I thought he'd be the aggressive fighter. AJ, is very very scared of being hurt..he received one solid jab on face/nose and you'd see his discomfort. AJ, should work on his killer instinct which he lacks. This was a KO bout for him. His confidence is at the lowest I've seen..
AJ done, time to wrap it up. Who comes in at 18st trying to box. More hugging then my chic 😂😂
Disappointed from AJ‘s streighth
Yea he sud retire!
It’s just sad. You have so much physicality but the movements are just so rigid. It gets worst as the wrong goes by. AJ needs a teacher
I just don't see Joshua going anywhere now .  Sad but my opinion .
Everybody i know who watched the fight noticed this too, the commentators are just there to try and guide the viewers perception, or rather blur it, the ref was biased too, warning Franklin for doing nothing whilst AJ hung on for dear life EVERYTIME his glass jaw was clipped, laughably pathetic in todays clown LOADED world.
AJ's losses have made him more into a "true boxer" style type of fighter. Only problem is he doesn't have the stamina for it. 😅 It shows how important the mental aspect of the game is.
Dead fight!!
well done AJ , got the win against a credible opponent , whyte rematch next then on to fury or wilder ?
Congratulations AJ. You won fair and square.
Joshua wouldn’t stand a chance against fury or wilder.
I have never saw anything in Joshua that could make me think he stands a chance against Fury.  Sluggish, seems to lack stamina, slow movement.  Fury would destroy him imo.
You can see AJ still has that Ruiz punch in the back of his mind....
Joshua made hard work of that.
would not last 5 rounds with the top men,gunshy
AJ didn't really get started until the 9th...
I’ve said this many time’s. Look at the aj vs klitchsko fight. For me he lost there something …. The way he looks & that fear in his eye’s and since then nothing was the same. Such a shame because he’s a real and complete athlete.
Every time Joshua was punched his face said what am I doing here, didn’t look like he wanted to be there to me
Все таки Джошуа неуверенно чувствует себя на средней дистанции, его часто там ловят хорошими попаданиями. У Джошуа нет такой спортивной злости как у Франклина и многих других боксеров, он хорошо обученный джентельмен в боксе, наверно это не хорошо для профессионального бокса.
I love AJ's new style of shorts, that change colour.. 🥊🤣🥊
💥Печалька, что не хватило крепкому Франклину чуток сил  до конца взорваться, чтобы опрокинуть этого пепсикольного длинного балеруна на канвас уже НАВСЕГДА!) 😆💪🥊🥊💥
Always used to like Joshua, but here I'm just seeing a very nervy, stiff, flat footed boxer with no bounce or aggression. Frustrating.
Joshua is a little.racist dog
No KO but AJ wasn't in any trouble there, pretty one sided. He controlled the fight. Fair play to Franklin, quite gritty.
Joshua ....slow & sluggish for me , seems to always be looking for that clean knockout - needs to start moving more and actually box ...ie throwing more punches 👊
Franklin did well the commentary was so biased and so was the highlights in between rounds
Top lad, but Joshua isn’t one of the goats…
From these highlights fight looked a draw or Franklin edging it. AJ is way over thinking he is not the fighter he was so worried about pulling the trigger and when does he doesn't do it with commitment and pulling out straight away allowing Franklin to come back. Old AJ would attack with commitment and bulldoze a Franklin.
AJ keeps resting his weight on his opponents. He tried that with Usyk but failed. For me, Frankiln could have won on a neutral ground. AJ should be adviced not to go near Wilder and Fury to avoid humiliation.
Джошуа, респект и уважение!🙏👍👏🇷🇺🇺🇦
Bruno the 2nd.
AJ is a fake, a pampered boxing product, he will not go down in history.
joshua definately bullied people when he was younger
AJ never came back after Ruiz fight
AJ was more wooden than Pinocchio
why is aj still boxing, he will never master it, still no head movement,  no  distance mastery, no hard punch, lacking speed and no killer instinct no intent. he must have enough to retire and find a new passion
Aj time to hang ‘em up lad..ur done
Such an awesome comeback. Congratulations Mr. JOSHUA.
Can't see Wilder v Joshua lasting long if it happens, AJ gets KO'd
AJ still fighting like bruno to robotic needs to move on his toes more, and be more aggressive.
As bad bad fight
Do u think aj would want to fight usyk again lol lol  He should retire after this performance. It's shocking
Franklin was very smart to hold when he was tired!! AJ extra weight mader him not be able to change angles whenever Franklin jumps in to hold.... dominant performance by AJ.... he had everything on the line, just started working with new trainer, surely in future he does exactly what trainer says.... losing streak is over.... now he can focus on being his old self....
Tony bellew needs to get off ajs manhood. Giving Franklin 1 round?😂
Josh needs a trainer that's going to get him to move his head more
AJ got exposed again
AJ is big, stiff, slow and timid.  He needs to work on his footwork, combos and confidence. The most work obviously going towards beefing up his confidence.   Franklin was fluid, with a bit more power he'd have floored AJ.
😊😅
My thoughts are that if Franklin have gone a bit harder it would be extremely difficult for Joshua to remain in this match, Joshua looks scared and he gets shaken pretty easily.
Joshua przy obecnym stanie w wadze ciężkiej nie ma co marzyć o odebraniu pasów Mistrzom.
U can't rate aj. Who has actually fought and won.  Imagine him and wilder He would be knocked into next week. Fury was just demolish him like a ragged doll
I thought they were both pretty tidy
Aj will never be champion again. He looks washed
I fell asleep after 3 rounds
Aj washed
Я рад за Джошуа! Он порядочный человек,и хороший спортсмен! Удачи тебе Британец!🙏👍👏👏
Kudos to AJ!
I don't know if I like AJ stance it looks a tad to square he is going back to the basics with defense I understand but yet this is a lil weird of him I do like his use of a long guard and framing still but a bit off balance at times he looked js he has looked better in the past
I see Joshua getting smashed if he fight any of the top 3 heavyweight, he doesn't look convincing. Nah.
Franklin was the better boxer, the fight was probably fixed in favour of Joshua.. ultimately this was just a fight to get him some credibility back after he acted like a complete tool when he lost to that little Ukrainian rabbit.
😂😂😂😂😂 12 rds with Franklin he is back hahaha😅
AJ needs to use more combo if he want to get back to the top. Fighting only doing 1 2 + slip is not enough at this level.
If Anthony joshua must continue in this trade, it is imperative he goes back to his former coach, rebuilding strength of the mind and speed and agresion for his weight.  Listening to his enemies' advice to lose weight and learning new styles has really cost Anthony josua a lot more in recent times. I also see bigger issues with his flat foot and poor foot walk.
Bruh what happened to Anthony Joshua? He looks so scared of getting hit that he's not punching as much as he used too, he's supposed to be a great offensive fighter but he's scared to throw a punch.
He is just a mediocre boxer fury would just play with him and wilder would knock him out inside 3 rounds
You can see Derrick James all in AJ boxing style!!
If you had listened to this fight, instead of watching it, you would think Joshua was the only one fighting… these commentators ignored every punch Franklin landed
Was not impressed by JA   U better keep on dodging fury and wilder  they would knock u out within 3 rounds
One wonders how AJ beat Klitschko, not that I support the latter 😢
Terrible ref and Franklin should have gone to wrestlemania with all that wrestling
A muscle bound robot, nothing i've seen here would worry Fury
Joshua is a better fighter outside the ring then in
Joshua is done on the big stage still trying box too much needs to go back to his old style of being more of a rough power puncher
Ради за Джошуа! 🎉 Мені цікаво що трапилося із одягом рефері і шортами Джошуа, чому вони стали червоними. Невже від поту🤔
😂😂😂😂😂 AJ
Back 😂😂😂 he was caught out against ruiz and his level has been caught out . Not championship material and should have to facd joyce next so that all arguments are settled and no one needs to hear his embarrassing meltdowns ever again . Along with jake Paul hd is the biggest embarrassment in the sport
Con ese cuerpo era para que nokeara. A quien sea no manches jajaja
Aj is done out here man
Glass chin AJ
It's a money fight ..No ifs no buts...🤡🤡🤡🤡..
Fell asleep half way through it
Never seen nothing different from aj he’s found his level for me he doesn’t beat wilder fury or usyk if they ever go again
He did'nt impress me , Fury would beat him.
Джошуа не жилец
Although I ‘m a fan of Antony , I feel like he did not performed well.
Heavyweight fights just ain't what they use to be...
People in the comments are soo dumb. AJ WINS by decision winning nearly every round, but is washed?. However if he had knocked him out in a couple rounds people would be saying Franklin is trash. No pleasing some people. Give the man respect. Atleast he fights all comers, unlike others...
Joshua will never win a Fight against Wilder or Fury.
glad I didn't pay, even the highlights are boring
Joshua has got to be the most infuriating fighter to watch. The size of him… needs to watch George Foreman and not copy but watch absolutely everything he done and why he done it. The bombs he could drop but he’s shot shy. You can tell he didn’t go through the amateurs, looks like he a training out there. Really want to see him do well, that fury fight is still interesting but I can see fury really toying with aj.
Fighting no names and calling it "comeback" emberassing
who the F is franklin ? brits always fighting unknown fighters, noobies!
When did AJ become so unsure of himself. He looks lost in the ring.
Boxing fans are weird. AJ only has a losing record against one man and just completely dominated a fight but people are calling on him to retire. This doesn't happen in any other sport. If a top 5 tennis player has a bad run or loses early in a Grand Slam, no one is calling for them to retire.
Any heavyweight of the last decade would be destroyed by a peak Mike Tyson, Lewis or Hollyfield.    We're at a very poor level in heavyweight boxing right now .    Fair play to AJ, though. He got the job done.  It would be close against Fury.  At least AJ actually wants to fight.
С таким боксом Джошуа пора на пенсию.
Come on AJ, we need those belts back, and Fury’s too…. Bring em on champ 🎉❤
When ever AJ hits with his right, he gets hit hard punches. That shows us that his techniques are very vulnerable. 6:04
Aj has no chance against Tyson fury
Joshua is too stiff and slow
Why spoiler?
I can’t wait for Wilder to separate dim head from his shoulders
Trash
This fight was billed as a statement - the return of British Boxing - however the statement was found lacking any real punch. Yes Franklin has a durable chin, but this fight was not billed to be a testament to that, instead AJ's return as a feared boxer. This fight ultimately proved two things to me... 1 AJ is not yet ready to fight for a world title 2 AJ is at best a top ten fighter, but for sure not a title challenger. Times have moved on from beating old men and fat little Mexicans.
AJ didn't duck Usyk. Decent guy and boxer AJ👍🏽
Turn the sound off so you don't have to listen to the Joshua fan club otherwise they especially Costello will spoil it. What a clown Costello has become. Honest opinion same old Joshua slow feet slow hands but showed more commitment because he was fighting somebody far inferior especially in size. He is clearly not an elite fighter and I just wish people would stop over hyping himand be more honest (especially Bellew)  in a very POOR heavyweight division.
Joshua has lost all his aggression and killer instincts. Kudos to Franklin for a decent delivery!
Such a boring fight Joshua is so boring to watch
So people payed for this?
Come on AJ!! 👊 ✊️
Let's be honest who knew who Franklin was? Out of all the contenders we get this fight
Props to AJ for the comfortable win, and respect to Franklin for a great performance. Important both fighters walked out the ring at the end of the day. But, Josh is 33 now, how long do you think he has left?
Joshua's back? Erm yeah back to he's average best.
Some b.s win over there
Aj is back 🤔 naaaaa , boring fight
Joshua looks scared to be hit
Another AJ snoozefest
The British commentators are so biased..well done Franklin.
Most biased commentary I ever seen, franklin was getting through alot of shots.  Brilliant by Joshua was the best comment ffs he's overated as f and to easy to hit
Has mickey duff been ressurrected and frank bruno  come out of retirement. If not give it up AJ your boxing carreer is over.
AJ is back ?!? Hahah he should stop fighting. Couldnt win clearly against a low ranked fighter. What would top fighter do to him 🤦‍♂️
AJ wasn’t serious about this fight. He played all through
Franklin is a fake
Anthony joshua is back??? Who even is the other guy
No wonder he ducked Fury.
the big promoters need to make a contract to get a big man tournament done before the great ones retire!!!!!!!!!! You cant sleep on joshua. He retired one of the klitschko's!!!!!!!!!!
Joshua pugile finito...
Anthony's chance of regaining a title is finished looking at this performance, stiffer than a wooden table.
I think someone needs to question Joshua's mental health or brain health. He is acting very bizarrely after fights. Either he's been advised to start playing the bad boy or something is wrong.
AJ did well, but looked really stiff in there...
Aj is still pretty trash though
Riveting performance there by Joshua...not
same old slow shuffling forwards, no movement, the frank bruno style. its laughable
AJ is so wooden now.
UK Commentators crooked af   *Franklin KO’s Joshua*  “Surely this will be a points victory for AJ”
Amazing improvements from AJ.  True ambassador for the sport. Love the way he carry’s himself - respect.
AJ so flat footed
Joshua should quit boxing ❤
AJ needs a therapist asap!
Tyson fury would dominate the pumped up body builder 😂
Let's have some  perspective, there's no pride in beating a journeyman!!  AJ is at risk of becoming irrelevant fighting fighters of this calibre.  Joe Joyce or Daniel Dubois would have finished this  Franklin guy in one round!😢
Franklin is underrated. Man was so aggresive but still remained extremly relaxed. Def a hard fight for AJ but at the end it was a deserved win.
Franklin was putting his hands on him... were the commentators even watching the same fight?
Can't finish watching, very dull and plodding match. It may pick up a bit later, but I can't carry on. Very disappointed, I wouldn't recommend Joshua tries Fury or Joyce.
Based on the highlights alone, I think the scorecards were a bit too wide. It seemed like it was a closer fight.
Why is Joshua like a plank of wood he has no fluidity at all. If this was fury he'd of destroyed him in the first round
Now fight a real heavyweight. No offence to Franklin but until Joshua fights Tyson Fury i can't get behind him.. Sorry different league
Franklin vs wilder next. That chin is absolute granite
He is back to beat the fruitcake.
New coach but still it's boxing by numbers for AJ - just slightly rearranged numbers!  Franklin is very tough but I was disappointed in AJ's performance
Aj is way overhyped, Franklin was a mess in there , coming in straightforward and eating AJ’s jab with no head movement or very little , no bobbing and weaving .. All it is gonna take is for AJ to take another clean shot from a decent heavyweight and not a perfect one him to be walking around the ring like a New born Fawn.
Wow with a bit of training and experience this joshua kid might make something of himself 😅
Kind of as expected, Franklin is a very solid and tough heavyweight but AJ is legitimately in the top 5 of current heavyweights was just a step ahead all night long, felt he could've pressed the issue and injected a bit more pace around 8-10 and he maybe could've got him out of there, but overall a solid performance and he's stopped the skid, AJ has all the tools to get his belts back just remains to be seen if he can put it together
Efficient performance by Joshua but I don’t think he’s Fury, Usyk or Wilder level anymore or if he even ever was
Joshua moves like a 100 year old oak tree
Absolutely terrible performance from Loshua 😂 this is tha end for him
Beautiful fight.
AJ looked stiff as usual, he’s still evading by going straight back rather than diagonally. His footwork has improved though..
It was no rumble in the jungle memories of Ali Fraser. Come flooding back.
Very unconvincing. I like Joshua but Usik and Fury is just in another class. As simple as that. 🤷‍♀️
AJ had a reach and height advantage but still looked cagey, he still cannot let go of them hands.
On this showing hate to admit it,but Tyson fury would box Joshua's head off,the problem with Joshua after the Ruiz fight he's scared of getting hit and it's showing,he's hesitant,I wish he would just go for it he's a man mountain with the power behind him jeeeesus
You don't have to be a great fighter anymore to earn millions.  Imagine aj lost he would do another one of his bitter speeches.  But guess what he would get bruno out of retirement to earn a few mill
Pity the fight wasn't shown rather than the 12 rounds of boxing that preceded it.
I'm still willing to drop 75 on AJ vs Wilder....  Megafight belt or no belt
Fury beats AJ. Easily.
Franklin 👍💪
More impressed with this Franklin guy than Joshua. Wanna see him fight some more, I honestly feel like he was robbed.
Was this a world class fight?......No it wasn't, if he'd have won on points against a dillian whyte for example and ended up with blood all over him then yes but the man he fought nobody had ever heard of really..a pointless fight, if Aj had smoked him in the first round we would be saying it was a knockover fight, and if it went to points like it did we would be asking all sorts of different questions  .. is this really the best you can offer us DAZN?
That was a highlight real? Joshua's jab is so slow I became bored watching it finish. Another bad heavyweight fight. No talent.
Don't think Joshua will be any threat to fury or usyk
AJ is not “back” he’s way past his best and I think he’s only got 1 or 2 more fights in him. 1 more loss and he needs to call it a day.
Congratulations AJ!
How can a fighter so buff lose all his power over night after one just one fight (ruiz fight). Is it fear, or is there something else going on here?
What a boring fight. No movement at all. Like watching robots fight.
So I ask you is Franklin better than Whyte or Chisora? If not or even the same level Fury stopped both. AJ didn’t stop this guy and let’s be honest he should have done in order to make a real statement. AJ has no excuses such as ring rust or injury he has been training for ages. So what now?
What a load of bs aj do me a favour 2nd Division Eddie's golden boy
Franklin took him all the way this is why Joshua will never be world champion
Joy Joyce will put AJ to sleep....
Fury and Wilder are a level above Joshua.
It says in the video title ‘Highlights’. If these were the highlights then that must of been an absolute borefest. Typical AJ, typical DAZN. Not to mention the commentary- absolute shambles!
What a snooze fest
Aj chose Franklin after watching Franklin's previous fights and said  "Yep I can beat him so il fight him" He may aswell brought in frank bruno from retirement.
AJ IS BACK .......... Hardly, Fury and Usyk will have watched this woeful performance thinking their belts are safe. The bigger question is: How did Franklin remain an unbeaten top contender before meeting Whyte and Joshua, he can't box, he can't punch, his defense is sloppy, footwork is poor, his one and only asset is his chin.
AJ needs to stop the holding behind the head and uppercutting Bad fighter
No more spark, brute force again like against klitchisko.
Joshua still looks like a robot with no head movement , I'd love to see AJ fight wilder or Joyce , can't believe dazn charged people to actually watch that ,should of been free on channel 5 lol
Franklin seems a decent fighter, i feel AJ holds back too much
Joshua has no fighting talent. He js not a natural boxer. You can see that he has learnt from the book. His reacting to attach is very slow and his defence is shockingly horrifying. He is predictable, hesitates a lot before throwing a punch. He is not sharp and very heavy to hold up during defence.
Back where?
Wasn’t a push over frankly aj has to work hard he’s a tough costumer
Looking to me like ajs done
I think of Bruno when watching him fight.
Aj wants his 100mill and go back to dubai. His not a true heavyweight contender
People need to respect Franklin a bit more. Tough guy who took a lot of heavy jabs.  I do agree that AJ of 2014/5/6/7 would’ve probably knocked him out.   The aggression has never been the same since he was knocked out by Ruiz. The air of invincibility has disappeared. Understandably I guess, but that confidence he used to have helped him push forward and finish fights.
Thats as far as AJ goes unfortunately he just doesn't have it in him.
Brauch man nicht!
Is everyone forgetting aj's famous speech after usky smashed him up.
Anthony Joshua is going to look like comeback George Foreman one day. The gut and everything.
117-111 on all the judge scorecards is embarrassing.
Not that impressive, I respect all boxers who get in the ring and battle but AJ doesn’t seem to have that special something that makes an iconic champion.
At this point, AJ should be much much better. Shall he continue. He needs to drop weight.  His current weight does nothing for his ability to maneuver in the ring. He's what we call in America, "BIG FOR NOTHIN'!" He gets burned out too quickly to be so massive. Having more agility would allow him to evade, sidestep, spin-off, and attack to have more endurance while being hit less. I also believe that his accuracy would increase, without sacrificing power. I'm tired of seeing such a great specimen failing to execute the K.O.'s he should be PILING UP WITH GREATER EASE. Training with Errol Spence will greatly help both fighters. Off subject. Errol sparring with a huge HW, and handling his blows is his key to victory against Terence Crawford.
Was this even a fight? Boring to watch. Is Franklin even a boxer? Joshua seems so weak, I could hardly recognise him or pick out a fighting technique.
Franklin was beaten by reach / height and no more, much as I like AJ, he would stand more chance of being struck by lightning than beating Fury.
AJ lost, Franklin clearly won that fight. But, I guess, the cash cow HAS to win now.
AJ went home and now thinking why people are trying to convince him that he is back to the game after winning against a mediocre pro boxer.
AJ doesn’t have the fire anymore. Will be a work over for Tyson.
AJ got the job done. Unlike Dillian.
Aj needs a few more fights with the new coach before his back
Anthony Joshua is not even close to ready for top competition. Wilder or fury will destroy this guy
Після Усіка,Джошуа вже не той.Начебто ідуть слухи що команда Усіка домовляється на бій з Уайлдером!То буде цікаво!Фьюрі жадібністю бій за обсолюта прогавив.Але 60 % що Фьюрі програв би Усіку!
Anyone know franklins walk out song?
Seems to struggle against shorter fighters.
AJ is not and never was a match for any top heavyweight.Too pedictable and robotic with a suspect chin.Similar to Frank Bruno in many ways but even Frank would have given him a run for his money.Lewis, Tyson, Vitali Klicsko, Holyfield, Fury, even a pumped up James Toney would all destroy AJ.
Say hello. Use the jab
Kein spektakulärer Sieg
Джошуа не вывезет Фьюри, он каждый раз показывает одно и тоже, не развивается абсолютно
Običan ples,nema veze sa boksom-dosadno za gledat.
Not impressed by Joshua at all. His opponent was much smaller and lighter than him and he really struggled against him. I think he should call it a day and quit because he’s definitely no boxer. 💀
Joshua looked so awkward!🤔
His name's Franklin what I thought he was called fat ksi
Mechanical, Robotic, boring, Racist.
Joshua very disappointing fighter :( not comparable to our fighters 20 years ago
AJ is done.
What a sparring match. For the love of Boxing, business as usual - of course AJ win the match.
AJ needed a conclusive finish to be considered in the top rank again.  Great technical fight , but still mikes away from competing with any of the top 3
Aj the flop ! Company man
Best part of the fight was after the final bell, boring safe tune up fight
Why does A.J. still insists to be a boxer? Just no talent bro.. Just admit it!
This is the man hearn and and aj said if he didn't put him away in 4 rounds and easily he should retire, aj is absolute pish
Joshua struggled he wouldnt stand a chance against usyk or fury even wilder
As expected. Fairly dull  Where can Joshua go now
sooooooo SLOW
Better from aj. Seemed to wana bang with a punch instead of tap -  still boring.  Still not a killer. Still a boring job   Got no chance against fury. Same old storey.   If it even ever happens   Fury is king  Fury won’t be beaten
Biased commentators lol you can clearly see clean shots from Franklin being ignored by the commentators...AJ with a bleeding nose in round 2 haha what a joke
Joshua? Not impressed. Calling out Tyson Fury? Don't make me laugh. Not a chance.
The commentary is so biased it's embarrassing.....get real he's fighting a 29th ranked opponent who showed him up for the limited fighter he is ....! Stop with all this Sycophantic hero worshiping .
Franklin is a tough, durable MF. But, AJ should have got him out of there within the 12.
Look, he did what it takes to get back. The stakes were too high for relaxation, a whole career. I'm sure that he can add a lot, it was clear that this is not all of Joshua.
Joshua’s the knockout guy and he’s lost that. Shame
I actually like what I see from AJ. He had a jab already, but now it's there consistently. I love that straight lead right as well. If he can improve his feet and defense a bit, then the K.O will come. Stay away from Wilder though, because AJ is definitely getting K.O. He has somewhat of a chance against Joe Joyce.
Aj looks so stiff.
Still waiting to see the highlights
The ref should’ve stopped AJ holding the head in the 10th too. Blatant
Joshua fighting a nobody again because he can't fight against a decent fighter
I looked so forward to this fight, but I was really disappointed.. Love that AJ got the win, but that is the most boring fight I have ever seen. Nothing but holding on to each other and barely boxing once in a while..
One of the worst fights I’ve watched. Boring
Man can't box
Joshua - S L O W
Funny how everyone loved Joshua a couple years ago,lost a couple fights and everyone hating on him.
AJ IS DONE. SPENT
flatfooted pro boxers lol what a boring fight. even more boring the commentator was.
Respect for Franklin - Joshuas time is really over - he dont will come back - to much static boxing, no/less combinations, to slowly
joshua as always slow and flat footed. Fury floors him with ease
My moms nigerian and my dad so in blood terms how english are u
Haven’t seen someone look that stiff since the time I found my mom dead lol. Joshua looked horrible, Franklin looked decent.
I think Wilder would knock AJ out and Fury would dance around him all night. Give AJ a few more fights....maybe even a trilogy with Whyte and Ruiz before stepping up?!
Erm… well. AJ is finished. Mentally weak now
"Headlock Boxing" ???🙄🙄🥊🥊
Aj has lost that killer instinct Yh he won but few years ago he would have demolished this guy fights so cagey now not loose atall
Back? He looks washed up.
AJ be smart and go in pension before you get bad KO against a top ten boxer !
Франклин не соперник Джошка!
Joshua is trash I can't see how this fight has helped his career atall why would anyone give him a title shot fury would walk through joshua big stiff body builder he's slow has no explosiveness wot soever boring to watch, I think Joe Joyce would pull joshua apart also this guys done
Billed as “The New Dawn”…..more like “Handbags at Dawn”
Football the same aswell its mad... Barnes and Raheem english??? Born in Kingston like... Vinny jones old Welsh tattoo he had lol from watford like
Fury would play with him.
Terrible fight for the paying customer, looked like a sparring contest.
This fight is making me feel sleepy to be honest …
There was a time when AJ would’ve beaten this guy inside 4
I have yo be realistic here.. Joshua is more heavy, no body movement, his punches is slow with no effect... Franklin's wzs more sharper puncher... Overall Anthony cant get anywhere with the way hes fighting..
AJ slowly morphing into a Klitschko with this stiff, upright, extremely conservative style
C quoi c combat...un loup touche touche 😂😂😂
We’re there highlights?
AJ top 10 fighter at best his whole career purely due to size and strength nothing more. I wish him all the best now he's not pretending to be the number 1
jfc what a boring fight, I felt asleep during the highlights
Aj is back after an awful performance 😂😂 slow, fat and lazy.. hope fury disables him
AJ looked relaxed and conscious of defeat all night. Little aggression would have given him a knockout in the 10th or 12th round.  He allowed Franklin to clip on him till the match is over.
Dazone...lol...made sure it was a pro Joshua highlight reel...thanks to Shady Edward. Franklin bust Joshua's nose early on...if that is prime Joshua ..he gets beaten by a real top fighter next time out...
Anthony Joshua jest jakiś dziwny nie ma tego ognia już
Wilder would destroy Joshua no problem 😂
Wilder would destroy Joshua no problem 😂
School boxer (Joshua) vs. Pro Boxer  Joshua is so boring to watch.
Wilder would destroy Joshua no problem 😂
Franklin was more combative than joshua who is taller to him but he is not a great boxer
Not the best performance from aj at all I think he’s still got his losses from Ruiz and usyk on his head  I’d ov given Franklin a better score than that  The judges must ov been watching another fight
Жду Франклин Руис 🎉 Джошуа не впечатлил .неуверенность против подвижных бойцов видна .тЧжело пережил поражения от Руиса и усика
Ah the end of the day, joshua beat whyte povetkin klitschko parker takam pulev. No one can take that away from him. But now people can see the joshua I’ve been criticize for years now.
Terrible fight AJ only watched half of fight so bored played FIFA more interesting 😴
Joshua, how do you hold out after a punch?
Don’t see if AJ can still beat Tyson, Wilder and Usky…
Aj you need to be more loose stop punching like ur a robot your so stiff
Harsh decision for Franklin there, could of easily been a draw.
This is why Joshua not a top ten fighter
After watching  this i am in no doubt now the reason joshua's camp have never taken the Fury fight,Tyson would destroy him and end his career and no more money for hearn, Joshua seems like a nice guy but never did really have much boxing talent.
"Highlights" 👀
Unfortunately Joshua has had his day , wouldn’t last 3 rounds with fury
I don't see AJ winning Tyson Fury, D Dante wilder got beat free times. AJ gos the  same way. Even if Tyson's overweight and not in shape 🥊
Retire this fool look at him struggling with the little men 😂
Na AJ lost it the guy to slow if frank was r lil bigger he would of win AJ needs to be more aggressive
joshua top 2 , franklin top 50 ? Why he is not Boxing a top 5 ranking Franklin is ranking 34 or 50
Aj would get pummeled but fury. And wilder too
Never used to like Joshua but now he's an underdog think my feelings have changed towards him.He looked very flat footed but his movement was a lot better than what it used to be. Boxing is becoming a bit of a joke let's hope a few big fights the fans actually want to see happen.
AJ Holding back of Franklin's head to land upper cuts at 11:54 Yeah AJ ain't back. He is done.
A J is back mmm really!! Just beat someone who was hand picked and took him 12 rounds..Never really rated AJ and on this performance definitely still don't..Have to say it but soz he wouldn't live the the Gypsy king...
Went to watch two men cuddle and occasionally a boxing match broke out
Franklin actually outlanded AJ…::
Aj has 00 head movement! You can’t fight Tyson like this honestly
Miss match
AJ couldnt even finish😂 he aint back mfcka washed couldnt even finish a C list fighter.
Anthony Joshua arms are still too heavy.
Joshua is the biggest fraud in boxing history
AJ is coming off two losses so to expect him to knock out Franklin is asking way too much in my opinion
Eh? Joshua fought?? I literally had no idea
I'm not empress by AJ
The gypsy king will be crapping himself after watching this.🤭.
Als ehemaliger Weltmeister muss ich Djosu sagen, dass er den Sieg nicht verdient hat, er hat mich sehr enttäuscht, er sollte sich zurückziehen, denn was er macht, ist sinnlos weit weg von jeglichem Spitzenboxen.
BORING BOXING
Joshua will never hold a heavy weight title again he's now just chasing a pipe dream
😴
Another awful fight by joshua 🙈🙈
AJ needs to retire
AJ too slow...
The referee needed to pay more attention, AJ constantly had his left hand pulling down on the back of Franklin’s head/neck, restricting his head movement. AJ is just a big loss waiting to happen now.
Garbage fight. Franklin actually faught a solid fight. AJ made it annoying to watch. Constantly holding he doing that Floyd swag. But this heavyweight we wanna see destruction amongst one another
Franklin is giving AJ issues,AJ nah he'll never win any belt again. 😂
Fury would make light work of Joshua
Джошуа бревно,ему не место в боксе
Give the people what they want to see. AJ vs Francis Ngannou.
Aj is back !! ... Really ? Back to what exactly? From what I can see he is still hiding behind a long boring jab which he throws from yesterday. His movement is none existent and personally I think Franklin out performed him. Considering AJ is 2 stone heavier you'd expect him to knock Franklin out but once again he seems intent on proving he is a boxer by putting in average performances against better boxers.  Hang it up AJ your done
Joshua’s style of fight has changed from being aggressive to being more strategic. We need to see more of his killing instinct in action.
I can't ever imagine AJ even putting up a challenge to fury. Fury is too fast and skilled. AJ moves like a tank.
Back 😂😂😂😂😂😂 by beating a nobody on points the guy always been overrated only reason anyone give the guy time of the day is cause young black man from London with a past let’s be honest
Weight looks different 😂😂😂😂😂
i cant lie they was hella fighting both sturdy indeed
Creed vibes
Franklin is a technical boxer,he  box like Andy Ruiz..he will become a champion soon
AJ is washed
Bruce Lee -be like water flow like water Joshua -flow like treacle Bruce flow like treacle
Anthony is back😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
AJ  will never be world champion again wants to fight wilder or fury the 2 of them will K O him
If I were Fury, I’d sign that contract to fight AJ. Easy fight for Fury. Wilder would knock him out with ease and there’s no point adding Usyk in there. AJ lots his killer instinct. He should go back to that style or go to Sugar Hill
This aint rhe joshua i remember
Joshua fights like a cardboard cutout! & Boring! Turned it off after 3rd round.
ajs finished fighting anyone In the top 5 he gets destroyed lost his natural killer instinct and is more robotic 🤖 than r2 d2 embarrassing and disappointing aj is not a elite fighter overall a pumped up Audley Harrison mark two needs to hang up his gloves and stick to under armour and jd commercials the bias in this fight is also ridiculous from commentators fury Joyce and wilder smash this robot to pieces
Aj doesn’t fight as dangerous as he once use to, I get that he is playing it safe, but you can’t fight fury like that .
I do not see any improvement by Joshua here to be honest... Against a tougher oppenent it will not do the job IMO
AJ used to be so xciting to watch . Now he’s so catious and nervous
Worse fight in many years. They were both slow, predictable and mainly jab jab jab. This is not boxing!!! 🤮🤮🤮🤮
Flanklin sure had came to fight.
Overrated
lolololololol
Franklin the best
Aj boxing like it’s his first time boxing. So stiff
AJ took so many free shots that if not fighting someone half his size, would at least rock / stumble him. Prolly will not happen but a fight between AJ and Deontay needs to happen. Loser retires💀
"Can he respond to the calls far and wide telling him to let his hands go?" In short, no he couldn't.
AJ legs have weights in them...
AJ can never become the champion again. So sad😔
Mike Tyson is the best fighter!
Aj moves like a bot
Since the Ruiz fight AJ is a different boxer. He wont beat, Fury, Usyk or Wilder. Not much more he can do in boxing now.
Joshua has no chance against wilder and fury nooooo way
those muscles stiff up AJ movements. left him with less flexibility or endurance. he offers sheer power and fitness,   that will age not very long, i reckon.  all in all, he is okay fighter. cant hope too much of him to be honest.
Horrible fight.
This was close one.
Aj is so bad
Feeling like creed🥊
😂😅Джошуа,не боксёр,а просто галимый лузер!
Commentary was soo biased had to turn sound off. And once again AJ shows his true character at the end of the fight, what an embarrassment! At least he found his level
Joshua isn’t the same fighter he used to be
AJ don’t want to see wilder tho, that’s the money fight for both even without the belts
una generazione di pugili modesti.
Man you can clearly see Joshua holding the back of franklins head every time they close up and obviously Franklin body shots don’t count
Fast hands Franklin
Anthony needs to go and see Mike Tyson because my word, no combinations and low skills just looking for the big punch all the time. Boring fighter.
It's disappointing to see a tall grown man with huge muscle folding his hands like a 13 years old boy... joshua your size is a waste to boxing   The commentator doing everything to hype the fight
Joshua's defense got better but his jab is way too easy to read
Joyce would slaughter both these guys.
Flat footed, sluggish jab, zero head movement, chin hanging out to dry. He's never been the same since Ruiz did the number on him
What colour was Aj’s shorts before and after the fight
AJ should go on love island
how to fight not to lose and not worry about the win
Joshua hasn't changed a thing, Franklin was the better fighter
When the highlight reel is sending you to sleep
Would not stand a chance against fury
Everyone was in favor of joshua even the referee 🤷‍♂️
Very poor fight, I want my money back (even though I didn't even pay)  !!!!!!
I see why fury calls AJ a Wooden Top 😅
Joshua should fight Tommy fury
Solid performance by AJ.  Does not look ready for the top tier, however
Joshua’s use of the jab was proof of the work done by the coaching staff. I saw a bit of the old Joshua, he brought the dawg back in AJ
AJ is boring af….absolutely nothing special  random boxer
franklin surprised me
Awful fight from start to finish, whoever the man was who told AJ to box tactically single handedly ruined his career. AJ was top class KO artist, poor footwork and movement but insane KO ability, so the person who told him to box instead of using his strength has ended his career. One of the worst, if not the worst, champions in heavyweight boxing in terms of technical ability, just go in there, throw a load of powerful combinations like the old AJ, get them knocked out in the first few rounds and get out of there with your win.
The red dye in AJ s gloves was running like a stray red sock in a whites wash 😮
joshua will get knocked out by a half decent opponent,the guy is mediocre at best .
His hands are just too heavy.
Franklin should move down a weight division and I think he could be a champion. AJ useless, not the same explosive fighter with exciting KO’s anymore.
Joshua certainly for a former world champion looked average. Too much standing off  for a top pro, more  like an amateur that wins fights on points and seems to be very concerned about getting stuck in for fear of getting knocked out.For top pros they looked tired all the time. An example of a fit athlete as a comparison look at Rocky Marciano. Now in Marciano you have a real athlete.
Well done AJ. You remind me of Frank Bruno when boxing. Wanna see more of Franklin though
Aj still fights like a robot 😢
To think that some people seriously believed joshua could beat fury...well, these are the days of delusion.
AJ is finished
Joshua keep holding Franklin’s head and punch him,what a great boxer
AJ took away Franklin's weapons. Like Franklin had nothing to work with
How did AJ get a bloody nose without getting hit? Ooohh it’s DAZN so they’re bias.
The Juggernaut will roll through AJ. I'd love to see that fight, but it won't ever happen!
AJ will get dropped by wilder AND fury. Probably Ruiz again aswell. RIP Britain’s poster boy
Bravo AJ, mais tu es toujours timide tu hésites trop alors que tu as les moyens et les frappes nécéssaires pour finir vite ce combat.
Would have loved to see AJ put more combinations together.....seemed content to just get a big shot off and go back to the jab so as not to get countered.... hopefully moving forward he lets the hands go
Useless
Joshua just isn't it anymore is he? I don't want to see him fight fury it would be pointless, unless Joshua fights Usyk round 3 and gets the belts back and then fights fury so it's worth Fury's time.
AJ is over Wilder kills him🥊
Is Joshua constantly on steroids?
Fury or Wilder smoke Joshua.  He's too stiff and not enough movement. Only dominant when he has the height advantage.
😂
Boring af ....cuddling the whole time. no wonder the fanbase is going to mma
AJ is an actor
“Franklin lands clean on Joshua’s face” Commentator- what a fantastic show of defence from Joshua to deflect that punch with his face!
AJ looked like an amateur in that fight moved about as fast as a zombie, no head movement, kept standing still like a statue. He gets destroyed inside 8 rounds against Fury I would even go as far to say KOd against Wilder. Didn't see anything that suggest AJ is back he looked better when he first burst onto the scene just looked like something was missing there for me even when his hand was raised he didn't look interested, no spark. Its a shame because I used to like him and now I think he's just being used as a circus act.
Franklin scared to get knocked out so he hugged lol
Que fuerte está josua ya está preparado otra vez .grande joshua
Gotta be Joyce or Wilder next for AJ surely?
Who won? I fell asleep😂
AJ didn't look impressive 😳  he would get bombed out by whyte
Joshua looked compact, in control. He looked quicker than usual even though coming in at the heaviest weight so far. He actually has improved.
Andy Ruiz really made AJ fear headshots.
AJ is back.  ??? 😂😂😂😂😂. Ok.   He's got brain damage
Doesn't have the DOG in him no more 😕.  Looks disinterested 🇿🇦
Joshua did what he needed to do to win. For me he really boxed well.
I agree with the comment Joshua probably has POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISSORDER.
Joshua needs a lot of improvement, to slow, no head movement and stay to still. Needs to work on speed and head movement. And can be a better fighter.
Commentary was awful
joshua  won  still a statue    but  will  never  beat  Fury  or wilder.  should retire..
He finally got a coach thats doing it. If AJ can listen and put in the work, DJ will take him far.
great who cares ?
AJ is scared...and it's just not worth a penny....
Most important was the win... so congrats to AJ.  Performance was ok, but not great ;-).  Now AJ have to come back with a great opponent and a great Performance.  Venga AJ!
Joshua clearly won all the rounds with the jabs majorly... the previous AJ would've ended the fight in the 4th round, he had so many opportunities for a K.O, kinda scared to take it...understandable too, couldn't afford to lose this fight
Again a glimpse here and there of what AJ could of been, but he’s not a boxing elite, seems to show more spite and passion after the fight.
I know it's hindsight but be fascinating to know what would have happened had he not had that first ruin loss. How would he have done against fury ect? Confidence looks shot to bits now and looks a totally different fighter
Beautiful boxing by AJ..man he's jabs and straights were on point
The man is just so robotic. Awful technique. If Franklin was the cash cow the judges would've given it him. Bellew scoring is disgraceful
Jos hand Gas moet geven lag eeerst ronde uit
Joshua looks like he'd rather be anywhere else than in that ring
franklin should have breast feed first😆 clown fight to boost joshua's ego‼️😆😂
British commentators are ridiculous
Why anyone cheers for anti British BLM loving Joshua is beyond me🤔🤨 Total respect to all fighters but people need to remember Joshua showed his true colours by supporting a totally discredited sham, violent group? Come on Fury,make the fight👍
AJs done so well in his career but in this fight despite clearly winning also clearly showing he doesn't have the elite edge to get back at the top and stay at the top. His attitude change from Humble to idiot isn't going to help to.
Boring.  Predictable fight.  Predictable result.  Why pay for this ,in any way  Excitement =Zero Passion/Heart=Zero
Not that old AJ.. hesitant fight by AJ... Looks like Boxing is like safety first nowadays...  Average fight by AJ..
Joshua will never be a great fighter
AJ is an Atari 2600 boxer 🕹
Aj always loser
terrible  bias  commontating..
Not impressed at not the journeyman AJ looks stiff,ponderous and no snap to his punches and his face looks a bit mess up with blood over him and he wants fight fury no chance he can forget that snd my advice to him is to fight ruiz Jr for the trilogy after both of them have one victory each against each other and wilder this year before fighting fury probably next year
Fury can beat him because, Whoever trains aj these days they must work for the other corner, because he looks just like vs usyk 1 timid and slow, we will never see the aj performance vs ruiz2 ever again... 😢
AJ the most  scrambled egg     fighter planet earth have
The spark has gone from Joshua.
MISERABLE FIGHT!!!!! TRASH!!!!
AJ
The American would have got knocked out if he ain't kept leaning on him he kept trying to tie Joshua up😏😏😏
No, he's gone  .
Commentators really acted like Franklin wasn’t even in the ring
Strictly come dancing. The most exciting thing in this fight is the commentator's voice!
Not a convincing win.
Wilder would destroy Joshua. The way Franklin was tagging him, imagine if that was wilder instead
He's very gun shy now. Finds himself in the same place as Wilder. Neither can now ever be considered an all-time great (imo) and its just about the paydays.
Joshua is a slow and a boring boxer
AJ should be retire from Boxing,this make no sense..
Lol, who tf is Jermaine Franklin?
Disgrateful commentator  they should be ashamed of themselves for  being biased
It's still tentative, Joshua (pre-Ruiz ptsd) was loose, aggressive, confident, ready to trade and let his hands go...if he has any chance for the belts again (or to even be enjoyable to watch) he needs to find that again...is it even possible though?
Joshua is finished he looks scared
Erf , the most slow boring off balanced fighter is back...
Joshua seems frightened.
Hahaha mafija boks kako namještaju josua haha pa Filip hrgovic bi ga prebio nego nedaju mu sansu ovaj ima 4 poraza Filip hrgovic nema poraza haha mafija ko sad sa alen babićem boksa u poljskoj bez naših navijača poljaci nam nedaju tikete mafija boks 😢
Anthony in his villain arc
This is why Mike Tyson is unique..
Boring af aj now 😴
Stop holding and hitting A.J.🤦
If your built like AJ you can always get away with the fact your not a boxer , it’s embarrassing, world level boxers should be walking through Franklin , AJ needs to hang the gloves up
Total embarrassment 🤮
Unbelievable bias commentary on Dazn. Shocking! Round 1 AJ nose bleeding when he gets back to his stool. Not a word was mentioned. That would never have been blanked if it was Franklin. Franklin showed a great chin and real determination. Put some respect on his name ffs!
Franklin survived by trying not to get kknocked and hugging.
Yawn fest
I think Joshua fought a decent first fight back but I think he has lost his edge..I think if he fights wilder next he will get knocked out hard
AJ seems so stiff and cautious, boring to watch.
I think Franklin stop dillian in a rematch
Thank you DAZN Boxing for this beautiful highlights. Beautiful video, decent pictures, no complaints. Thank you once again for this beautiful work.
AJ is not happy with this ...
AJ has the longer reach but is afraid to throw punches
AJ lost confidence coaching all wrong needs someone like James lights out Toney to skool him
What a boring fight. Joshua doesn't have a knockout in him.
Time for AJ to look for another career.
AJ is no longer value for money. Another performance where he has stunk the joint out.
I think AJ is done
I see that AJ has learn a new defense technique this time. The clinch. The 'old Aj' was too confident of his in fighting and never really did that, therefore lost to a better brawler, ruiz.
Was that rely the highlights? Not bothered I missed it now.
Keep running Joshua....everyone knows you're  afraid to fight the best fighters out there....that's why you are laughed at.
Mandaron a perder a ese costal
Pathetic performance by AJ
Well done to both athletes Aj has clearly improved top work gents!
Aj looks calm
Slug fest
Imagine paying ppv for this only for the highlights to be released the next day
Well back and now going nowhere
TÜRKÇE ALTYAZILI NEDEN YOK
Aj will b remembered as a racist for generations after the BLM protest
Franklin legit fighter,  AJ fight smart 👏
He's terrible Joshua boring fighter they get close he hugs them everytime
If I'm being honest Antony should avoid fury fight ... Just being honest Fury's movement alone will mess Joshua up🤏🏾  No Knock out? Poor result
Don’t think Franklin looked badly hurt once  He came back with more each time he got landed on, Commentary sounded a little one sided too
No Stoppage or significant damage done to Franklin and he's the shorter fighter I didn't see no dominance on Aj part I'm not impressed
Franklin showed class even though he was the smaller fighter and the odds were against him he still has that confidence to take the fight to the deep end, 12 round of fighting from the underdog is just amazing 💪🏿
Not that convincing by AJ. He needs to up his  workrate and attack more! TF I would knock him out!
We were waiting for a Wilder or Fury call out.....The no K.O. victory humbled him?
i miss the killer instinct of AJ... where's your former punch?? come on dude!! don't forget u ever had it.. u do only need a great chin...
AJ needs a psychologist, not a boxing trainer. He doesn't trust himself, he looks hesitant and more concerned with what could go wrong than with imposing himself on his opponents.
Robot dosser
AJ is back? AJ gone forever. He won't be fighting champs anymore it's over for his career.
I thought i was watching two lovers wrestle nothing spectacular about the fight.
AJ IS GREAT
Anthony ROBOT Joshua is done for.  Stiff as a board. No head movement. Useless
Joshua fought scared this time
AJ is a great boxer , I will always support him is so ispirational He has rockets instead of hands
At 12:34 AJ was going down, Franklin just couldn’t sense it!!
Ruiz broke Joshua! he's not the same since the KO
Joshua is finished he looks like a robot out there slow as 💩
I can respect Joshua for doing what needs to be done to get back in rank
Nice fight, AJ after 3 loses became surviver,  not a warrior but surviver with skills. Franklin surprised every one-strong chin, very fast hard puncher-Im sure we will see him in UK again....
Franklin is c class, AJ just didn't throw punches like he used to,,, easy demolition win for AJ pre Ruiz
Anthony joshua is a BATTY MAN 100%.
AJ is too calculated. He needs to loosen up
Aj will never be thesame. Amir Khan of the heavyweights now...that same look Amir khan always has.
Where's the brawl in the aftermath?!
Wilder has got AJ number he better stay away from the bombsquad fury only one can beat him even fury says these dossers better stay away from him
😴😴😴
AJ will still loose with Usyk and Ruiz. Very Rigid. He has lost his confidence. We expected a TKO.
Wilder would send Franklin to a different stratosphere
Интеллигент на ринге среднего уровня Скучно
Franklin the new Chisora
If AJ fights like that, Fury will smash him easily
Post fight anger again SHAMBOLIC
Aj way to stiff and can’t move it’s a fact fury would clean him up within three rounds facts
Joshua looks permanently rattled, not the same fighter, respect to him for fighting but I don't think boxing is his focus anymore
Joshua too wooden no fire predictable
Aj just looks to tentative still
I like the way Aj controls his anger
You can clearly see that AJ is over thinking things in there. Needs confidence and proper guidance.
AJ fights is not exciting at all
Feel sorry for who ever paid for this
Aj. Has issues
Height
What a bore fest z z Z glad I didn't pay to watch it 😊
AJ is a shadow boxer😂 Man's washed up. Can't stand Joe Joyce, Will struggle with DDD
So no Knockout smh
Boring right.
Bad performance by Joshua
I dunno Franklin look like he was getting the better in most of those exchanges. Joshua looks super slow and stagnant.
I disagree with the judging numbers with this fight. I thought it should have been a tie a least. Jermaine had the first four rounds and a couple of the other rounds were tied and Anthony won the last two. Jermain was throwing more punches and was faster and harder with more aggression.
Joshua didn’t work out to be the poster boy the boxing world wanted him to be..
For me Joshua isn’t the same fighter since the Ruiz loss
Dude won but has lost his fire. I hope he gets that spark back
We need Joshua vs Wilder
Well done, you struggled to beat no one
Let's put things into perspective here though, can anyone see aj in this form beating a young Mike tyson in his day 😮
Anthony Joshua's 😂😂
Both men do a great job, well-done guys
Boxing is no more interesting...no KO punchers like Mike Tyson in the game anymore...all they throw now is mere jab..
AJ the body building male model . You’ll never convince me he will be anything but an underarmour poster boy . Franklin looked more relaxed and active . AJ looked hesitant and was a one two puncher . Pedestrian at best . Boring fight !
Imagine what would wilder do with aj
Boring
Aj looking poor.
Let's see Joshua v Ruiz 3.
After this fight isofficialy confirmed: AJ is not a top 10 fighter anymore. He should stick to these outside of top25 bums.
😂 like anybody seriously thought Franklin would win. This was a nothing fight. Silly infact
AJ is too conservative now I don’t like this style of boxing it’s boring and predictable 😅
The main thing is that AJ continue to develop and learn from Derrick James. I thought he would gas but he didn’t; follow the process. I think Franklin is a tough dude though, but the win was necessary, else, social media keyboardists would have slain him…
Anyone who thinks AJ stands a chance against Fury is nuuuuuttttttsssss! 😂
Who would of thought AJ "Hearn Cash Cow" is a former heavyweight champion. He looked like a scared little cat in this fight, wait until he fights anyone half decent again and he'll hit the deck.
This man is it 3  ran in the world at will get destroyed by wllder and fury
Aj holding and punching in the clinch
AJ has lost his confidence
Respect to Franklin big step up Joshua needs to retire poor showing scared cagey throughout he's done Ruiz ruined him
Still not seen an acknowledge the digusting speech he gave after loosing the belts& after watching this he’s got a long way to go till he should be considered to fight for them again, I think he could of very easily lost that fight last night
Joshua seems like he doesn’t want to be there fr
AJ fought like a real champion last night👊
Really don’t like this commentary team, I think I prefer Adam Smith and he’s also terrible. As for AJ he looks like a busted flush.
Wilder will destroy AJ
Aj: Throws 1st uppercut of the fight.   Commentator: Wonderful variety from Joshua.
His career is in the end. He has no chance if he fights against the top three in heavy weight. Even against dubois or Joyce he has no chance.
AJ goes for 12 Round. I m pretty sure  he will never fight with fury. Game over for AJ
AJ a bloody mess with a broken nose at the end. At least he didn't quit this time. Props 👏
AJ is horrendous, he doesn't even want to be a boxer anymore you can see clearly.
AJ holding Franklin's head and upper cutting him 🤣🤣🤣
How i want boxing for Joshua vs Asbarov(russian fighter).that's will be a huge fight I am sure......
Joshua is the only heavyweight that doesn’t impose his weight he accidentally imposes his size on others one of the oddest boxers
Why was the bell stopped 7 seconds early
AJ has got to be the stiffest boxer I've ever seen
A decent performance from AJ. He will be pretty pleased with that. Not sure how he would do against an opponent like Fury or Wilder though. I think that’s another level. I think he should fight Wilder next. If he can get past him, I’ll say the promoters will have to put a Fury v Joshua fight on. There’ll be nowhere else for them to go. We’re going to have to wait and see.
AJ is like bruno was, stiff predictable and robotic, Tyson will destroy him, simple.
Alot of improvement from AJ. And kudos to Franklin.he seems fearless. Wow that left hook from AJ was hot🤯. I love this fight.🤡
I like AJ but since Ruiz, seems to have adopted a safety first style which I think is undermining him. I wish him well, get Lennox Lewis in his corner.
Boy really had a fat short dude as his opponent
When the highlights are even boring you’re in trouble
AJ doesnt have the chin to become the unified champ. His fight against Ruiz exposed that. He risks getting tagged and losing his legs when he throws long combos so he played it safe with small combos and jabs against Franklin.
AJ tucks no one like some heavyweights...
Powerful king franklin
Franklin showed the heart of a lion AJ looks like a scared kitten 🐈‍⬛ 😂
What a boring fight...
What a hype job.......and the commentary trying to hype it up.....JOSHUA!!!!!  HES........WALKING AROUND THE RING.............THREATENING A JAB.........joke
Mike Tyson would’ve destroyed this dude. AJ fights with no rhythm he’s a robotic euro lower level novice
Wear is the crowd noise coming from they look like there waching paint dry
I’m really not sure about the result of this fight I mean either way I can’t see him standing any chance against usyk or fury if this is how he’s going to continue to fight so really what’s the point if I was him I’d retire get a property portfolio and enjoy my life…just sayin🤷🏻‍♂️
My goodness!! 😢 to boring
Whatever was there before the first Ruiz fight is no longer there, and it's getting worse. He needs to retire before he gets hurt.
Fair play to Franklin great fighter.
Nobody is talking about Joshua's defence which has really improved
im sorry but after watching this i feel like tyson fury would ruin anthony joshua, but im a fan and love to be proved wrong so lets see that fight! hopfully.
Joshua’s fighting style now is just not exciting anymore is it
Commentary by joshua fan boy. 😅
Joshua is an overhyped boxer
Its a different AJ better boxing skills
Joshua has no bounce, no footwork, a sitting duck for a quality opponent…NFI
We have not seen an explosive and destructive Heavyweight since Mike Tyson. Mike would indeed destroy the entire HW
Walaupun AJ menangkan partai ini, tpi masa kejayaan beliau tlh berakhir.
Joshua is so bad if he's not careful he could be another Audley Harrison
I bet you Tyson fury is laughing @ this no way Joshua will beat fury on that performance  Even usyk will want to fight Joshua 😮
Andy Ruiz would be a major problem for Aj now
Tyson fury would knock AJ out in 3 rounds 🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊 easy !!!!
Tony Bellends scorecard😂
Joshua + boxing = yawn
Franklin the more fluid fighter
Joshua needs to ignore boxing training lose a little weight and just do stamina  training joe joyce will Bury him in the 7th
Everyone forgetting the difference in ranking 😂 took AJ 35 mins to actually come close to knocking Franklin down. This will be his last win, he can’t compete against the top 10 boxing like that
Franklin has got an iron chin those uppercuts were prefect   But i think joshua is afraid of getting hit now he just hesitates to go all in
well done to both men. nice to see you back AJ 🥊
😂😂😂 AJ the robot needs to retire
Joshua still angry about that usyk loss lollll
Congratulations AJ
🤔🥊.. Well done to both fighters.. 👌 to come away unscathed is the most important aspect 👌.. Franklin done superbly as wasn’t expected to see it past 5 rounds at best .. not quite a statement win for AJ yes he won but nothing’s actually changed 🤔..I don’t see any of the big hitters @ the top table being concerned .. after watching this bout … “Deontay Wilder” would relish the chance of a bout with AJ .. however I feel that would be AJ’s last & he will no doubt look to ensure he avoids that dust up…
He’s still so static and linear and, though. Anyone with lateral movement (Usyk, Fury etc) will destroy him.
Gone from highlighting big main events defending the title in Saudi Arabia to main card on a DAZN on back street of Sheffield.
AJ is so boring
Joshua is too stiff and predictable with his punches. Fury will destroy him early.
AJ looks like an over sized ironing board and tiered him self out holding his silly arms up 😂 I think he threw about 10 punches lucky 🍀 wait till he fights The GK then we will see
My man AJ looks like he lost his soul !!
Only for Andy Lee you wouldn't have known anyone other than aj was in the ring by listening to the commentary, also bellews scoring is embarrassing
Fury would beat those two at the same time with one hand behind his back.
Disappointing for joshua another points verdict need to work on knocking people out.
AJ cant even take out a factory worker anymore. Big respect for Franklin
Points decision against a nobody and hes back? Hahahahah. Cant even throw a 3 punch combo the sausage
The biased commentary was ridiculous Franklin put on a great performance landed some nice shots but it was all about AJ it’s quite funny
Nice having that British ref allowing Joshua to hold the head and uppercut like MMA without a single warning.
To me, he looked worse and lazy. I  think he looked better with that (1) stint he had with Floyd Mayweather Jr.  That fight that he got the knockout. People/ fans just do not like Floyd, but he would have been better under Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s guidance. Mentally he clearly does not have confidence, and he looks too stiff.
AJ was very careful in this fight. It seems he is developing himself more as a boxer with knockouts as incidental events. He still needs to do more to move his feet, which will be tricky those bulky muscles. He is also gun shy with not many combinations or follow through
Joshua is as stiff as that "raving bonkers" toy from the 70s
more of a tapping fight for first ,8 Aj nees to fight more or others will ko him
Complete BS all them fans paid to watch couple of amateurs heavy weight boxing should be more exciting than that all the training they do in the gym can't even string a flurry of punches in disgrace just a easy way to make millions
Сколько за это спарринг заплатили ?
Franklin is not quiet oppent
Joshua never will be a big champion again!! What a bad fight!! He will lose against Fury, Usyk, Wilder and all the other world class heavyweight boxer! May be it is better for him to stop his boxing carreer and may be its better for him to start a holywood career! What a bad fight!!
AJ is such a lazy fighter, stands absolutely no chance against Tyson Fury. Imagine Fury against Franklin? it would have been an easy knock out and a one man show. Shame on AJ.
Joshua is a coward,,afraid to punch,lol
Great night of boxing. Main event was a great fight. Franklin's a tough game opponent
HORRIBLE FIGHTER
AJ beats a no boat 😂 🤡
AJ must be looking for an early retirement if he wants Fury or Wilder
Frank is honestly a joy to watch
He's not the same fighter anymore,understandable..But he's still achieved more than 99.9% of his fellow humans.. Go on AJ
AJ needs to work on his speed while attacking
I like AJ, not a hater like these other clowns in the comments. But I do think he's got a lot of problems in his own head. The few times he let his hands go and threw combinations he looked great but most of the time he was hesitant, and after he threw a shot he instantly backed up and covered up. He doesn't want to get hit and it shows. He flinches and reacts a lot. Without his self doubt or whatever it is causing it he's a great boxer, but with it he becomes stiff and looks sluggish.
Decent fight with 2 men at their level.
Isit me or does aj not move a lot he’s like a robot
It was like watching strictly
AJ is not back, he never went away! He will always be our Olympic champion, World Champion, British Champion and one of the best heavyweights to ever come out of this country.
The only improvement I've seen is AJ's punch resistance. He's still getting caught with shots he shouldn't be. Some of the right hands he ate tonight would've had him all over the gaff in previous fights. I cannot see him getting near a world title again...
Не очем бой
I’m so glad I didn’t stay up to watch this fight 😂 AJ looking rigid af 😕
I find AJs boxing style awful and uncomfortable.
Truth to be told "AJ HAS NOT GAINED BACK HIS CONFIDENCE"
Contrary to what the caption said, Joshua struggled for a win in this fight. Franklin gave him all that he could handle. Judging by this fight, Fury and Usyk still whips him.
Respect to AJ and game plan, like Ruiz too he had to change and Franklin is a warrior but timing and boxing Intelligence allowed AJ to lean on him and hit great shots
Isn't it interesting you lose belief in your power and it goes!!It proves that the mind plays a big part in boxing 🧠
Joyce is gunna eliminate the division
garbage fight!
AJ won but he isn’t as interesting to watch as he was .. that Andy ruiz defeat set him back 20 steps.. he rarely attacks cos he fears a knockout meaning he relies of jabs till the end of the fight
Retire joshua before you get hurt
Losses have given AJ the fear he fights as if he’s more worried about losing than he is about winning
Joshua is done fighting nobody.
AJ is back!!!!! Please.. Another mediocre performance from this mediocre boxer. Fury and Wilder will distroy him.. Game over AJ.. Game over..
2 BUMS FIGHTING
it seems llike hes slowed down like joyces style.   but againt any top fighter he will be folded.  he dont have joes chin
Wooden performance ... would still loose against decent opposition
Franklin did a great job,he looked hungrier and more ambitious. Aj still look very slow and heavy...but huge improvement on his power jabs but i m not sure that's enough to take him back to the top
Skill wise, Fury is level above him. I don’t think AJ can beat Wilder.
if antonio joshua dares to play in class 175 against bivol...i'm sure bivol will win...the problem is joshua moves too slowly.
Joshua is no longer the same explosive AJ as before. The losses have impacted him severely.
They should deduct points for those tie ups.
Even highlights I watched in less than a minute 😂
AJ is throwing his regular hook as if hes trying to do a check I don't know if that's planned or he doesn't know how to really throw a check
Where they rent those judges from...franklin landed more or am i just critical of aj
Is there someone decent coming up through the ranks when Fury retires?  Joshua is a Bruno replacement.  He'd be better off doing Panto
AJ seems to get worse with each fight it’s nuts proper robot!😂😂😂
Looking like Creed
What AJ still lacks 1. Feints 2.fails to step when he jabs or throws a cross. Makes it easy for him to be countered and it makes his punches weaker. With a step jab he can drop an opponent.  3. Still lacks combination punching. The first jab and cross must always be light to draw a reation followed by real and  mean counter punches.  4. Poor lateral movement when punching and evading.  5. He is not counter punching. The lack of side way movement when he defense leaves him in a poor position to counter punch.  6. AJ looked a bit tense, he needs to be loose and mean.   Great win though.   If I was his trainer i would make him run two rounds each time he fails to throw at least five 3 to 4 Punch combinations during a  spurring round. If he steps sideways and forward with each punch, he will force the opponent to shell up.
AJ wasn't impressed with his performance. I'm sure he wanted a KO
Well deserved win but AJ has to be one of the most boring boxers to watch
great win, franklin isn’t a bad boxer too. He was a fight where was better to not risk to go for the ko, because Aj is coming back from 2 losses.
Joshua is not the same, he has zero chance of beating the best in his division.   Wilder kos him badly.  Tyson makes  him quit.
aj has changed since ruiz fight
AJ is simply not a boxer
Looks like white deserves more credit for taking Franklin's 0
I can new energy in AJ
Franklin vs Ruiz would be an awesome fight
Ovo nije boks još ima traume od Useyk  šta ljudi dodju gledat nula od boksa bolje žene  boksuju
at least Joshua never got near the microphone...
No one want See that but at the end understanding
Franklin loves Joshua so much, doesn't want to fight
Shocking fight as you need to retire if u fighting like this
This got shadowed by the wwe ppv 😂 imagine being outdone by roiders in tight leggins 😅😅😅 AJ is finished not back, he'll never be a champion again he's to fragile and likes to fight tradesmen by the looks of it 😂
the king  🎉
Неочем бой , Джошуа большой ссикун
AJ  doesn't have any sparkle or flare, its bland slow & predictable at best. Shame that as he really could been an amazing fighter that people would of remembered with alot more passion.
Remember franlin is also a heavyweight massive fighter so Joshua was being careful lets give credit
Ждошуа вообще славый
Joshua is a fkn awful watch. Not worth a ppv at all. Hes lost what he never had. Easily one of the worst heavyweight boxers around
Its hard to believe that AJ was once the top dog.... hes so stiff...
Fear fear fighter .Anthony use your strength and body you are too lazy boxer😅
Joshua should stop boxing and retire
Mint Franklin 👍🏿😏 gave Josh the nosh of boxing
Not convinving Performance at all from aj
joshua looks improved since the ruiz fight but the same  time he looks super heavy and much slower he just not ready for the top 3 wilder,fury or usyk i think they all would had KO'd franklin
AJ is done, he is looking for a final payday with either fury or wilder and call it a day, looks gun shy and scared to get hit, he will tarnish his legacy going against fury or wilder.
AJ isn’t back! Look at his movement. His head reflexes and movement is slow. The same
Aj didn't look like he was there, too cautious and lacks movement , against wilder needs more
You got to give AJ credit, he’s a pretty accomplished boxer….for a bodybuilder
Wilder will KO Joshua in 2 rounds
I like joshua performance no matter what y'all dosers say. He was calm , relaxed and controlled the fight!
Джошуа становится  неинтересным,пора перчатки на гвоздь,воля к победе напрочь отсутствует
Joshua is done. Can't knockout an opponent
Great Joshua confidence is back
Unfortunately, AJ fights without aggression and willingness destroying the opponent. He makes clinches very often, although for manny of viewers it looks like it's his opponent tactic. Next fight must be with Wilder to reveal who is better and close beautiful period of last 10 years in heavy weight boxing.
how about if Aj vs Welder? who will win?
AJ looking watery as man. Also it's been said and said but the guy will never be back, he was an animal before because he truly believed he was invincible, now he wears the fact he isn't in every bout. Retire brother. Wishing you all the best, time to give back now.
I think joshua will retire soon
Joshua is to scared to let his hands go hang up your gloves ffs that wash trash
Jako blijedo jadno za bivseg prvaka
these 2 big dude shared slaps for almost all the game, was sooo boaring
AJ is so bad. It’s like watching an ironing board try and fight
This fight has to go on the world's top 5 most boriest fights... I had a hard time staying awake...
AJ is back? Can't fool me...they pick up a farmer for him to farm...we know the deal.
He was under pressure but he won hes back now wait and see
I’m disappointed and happy at the same time. Joshua Still staying with the safety first style,( lost 222$ bet on him to get ko) but at least he got the win.
I think AJ isn't at his best still.
U aloud to hold the back of their head and give upper cuts?
AJ is back"Back where tho?🤔
AJ ENTIRE STYLE OF BOXING HAS CHANGED SINCE LOSS TO RUIZ! HE IS MORE TECHNICAL, CLINCHES DURING INSIDE BOXING HIS STAMINA HAS IMPROVED! DEFINITELY NOT A KNOCK OUT KING LIKE EARLIER IN HIS CAREER. HOWEVER HE IS EARNING A LIVING.
Give coach Derrick James his flowers. I know he wishes AJ let his hands go. But DJ is the real mvp
Joshua is slow....... Loses against Fury or Wilder for me
STAGED NONSENSE..
Franklin gained a fan
Congrats to AJj for the won, but this is far from being the greatest comeback in boxing. This guy will struggle against better fighters. Let him fight at least wilder next and see what happens...
Joshua is finished. Struggling against Franklin.. he would never be able to beat Tyson Fury or Usyk ever.
Aj looked more grounded with this less bouncy, moved when we had to.
AJ did what he had to do to secure the victory. AJ still looks hesitant and get's hit too much. He won all the rounds but was taking body shots and straight rights to the head. He never opposed his presence and power on his opponent. His opponent felt safe enough to stand toe to toe and trade punched throughout the whole fight. I actually feel that Joe Joyce is the slight favourite if they were to fight 😮😳
If that was the highlights it must of been a BLOODY boring fight.
Joshua was very poor and didn’t look interested. It was like watching a beginner
Franklin was fit , tough , aggressive and has a supurb chin. 12 tough rounds for AJ which will do him no harm
Like i said franklin is better than parker .
sincerely speaking, Joshua needs to resign. He isn't improving at all.
Гребаный договорняк !!!!
To be fair Franklin did have a six pack, and aj has fully transformed into Frank Bruno
No AJ is Gone
Now this is what Joshua should have been fighting start of career instead of what he was .. this just proves he middle of the range fighter
Franklin definitely underrated. Joshua looked accurate and strong. Both showed chin and power. Fury's on a low now mentally. Joshua's in for a chance. All these Fury haters; I think if Fury beats Joshua then that can shut the mouths temporarily of the Fury haters. The landscape looks much better now with Joshua back in the mix.
Lord have mercy the boxing expert under this post 😄
Zzzzzz
The best of Joshua yet. The variety the caution. He will be trouble
AJ is back BUT he is not the old one. Where is the knockdown?? That's heavyweight folks!! Big respekt to Franklin 💪🏼
Not impress, big size difference
AJ still getting lot of hates till now after the win people saying he is trash worse while they are the real trash the champion is working on his skills defense he game playing now he proved twice that he can out box a boxer for 12 rounds he can beat the top guys he came back with new style whatever y'all say guys but one thing you guys only talk trash in yt comments while champion on his road way to championship 💯💯 AJ💪🏻
Franklin held on for dear life.  That shot was solid.  Fair play to Franklin
Excellent jab and footwork from aj
Draw
Ajs finished, going to a decision with a guy nowhere near on his level. Aj 4 years ago would've finished this potato in the 3rd. Ruiz really changed the whole man's career. Scared to finish now
Referee letting joshua get away with illegal shots 🙄
Aj is back
Someone needs to cancel the announcer for cultural appropriations for that hair peace. I don't really believe in that sort of thing but I'll make an exception. Because that 💩 looks ridiculous.
Wilder would sleep Joshua lol. Fury would make Joshua look amateur.
Wow, they actually had a fight in the last 10 seconds
Am I the only one who thinks that in this fight AJ boxed worse than in the second fight with Usyk?  Then he moved much better on his feet, made combinations of punches.  And in this fight, he often didn’t reach with his right hand because he didn’t take a substep.  He also forgot about the uppercut, which is unacceptable when boxing with a shorter guy.
Decent performance but still miles behind Wilder and Fury
Hug Party again
Aj needs to go back to how he used to fight. Knockouts left right and centre.
Still stiff as a board an getting caught with too many punches. Would get hurt by fury/ wilder. Better offensively. Should be putting fighters like him away. Joshua’s found his level
AJ is so wooden. Franklin looked so much better.
Congratulations to AJ
I'm sorry but I'm not at all impressed by what AJ put on tape. If he fight one of the top tier fighters like he won't win..imo
It was always gonna be a tough fight.. for AJ to get a knockout is really all about creating that opportunity, it's hard when you're fighting a counter puncher who's looking to slip and shoot but also anticipate your shots.. AJ worked well behind a hard jab and the right hand kept landing well when he timed it.. he looked very solid in this fight much better than the Usyk fight but of course Usyk is also a master technician so he's really been in there with very skilled opponents in his last three.. I would love to see another massive fight for AJ soon however perhaps Whyte next or Wilder would be perfect to close out the year.
Not an impressive win by Joshua. He held for 50% of the fight and Franklin is not that great of a fighter. To me Joshua is just looking for excuses to stay relevant by switching trainers. His uncle Eddie Hearn is protecting him him for now. He’s one of Eddie’s cash cows in the UK. Not impressed.
Joshua paced himself well,used that reach advantage with that jab,and for a big guy that step back worked for him, them tactics won him the fight,.Franklin fought well to though and made it a fight,.nice speed,letting his hands go,.they both done well enough,Joshua’s tactics just edged it though,and that’s how you win being smart.
Joshua got bulkier and less mobile on his feet. Didn't he learn anything from Usyk?
Joshua is a robot
I hope for Franklin he can also have a decend career in the future!  Aj did fight a great match!
If it was Usyk people would be saying it was a masterclass.
Joshua vs Wilder seems perfect RN 😊
AJ just seems to lack that 1% that puts him on a championship level. Guys built like a tank but he seems to have lost the venom to go with it.
Before watching this vid - AJ won his setup fight…
AJ doesnt look like a wc tbh, to slow and no confidence. Fury might actually fight him😂😂
Joshua looked scared he will get knocked out by both fury and wilder
He should fight deontey wilder
Back to what? An unranked fighter just took him the distance. Joshua isn't an elite heavyweight and he never will be. He's been very well promoted and was gifted a route to the tiltes
Joshua is a huge disappointment
Congratulations AJ looking super relaxed in control ❤
Joshua has a lot of work that he needs to do otherwise he is an average boxer
Before the fight, I admit, I was a bit on the side of those who said, he needs an impressive knock out, but sometimes that's not how it works out, I thought he done well, never in trouble throughout the 12 rounds, comfortable win, having said all that... the jury is still out, is Joshua back?
joshua fights so stiff, I just don't see him beating a bigger version of usyk in tyson fury who is slick and moves well like usyk did. With the wilder fight, I don't see Joshua being able to take wilder's power like fury did and wilder's pressure might also be too much for joshua who fights at a very slow pace.
I got no dog in this fight but I have to say Joshua showed nothing against someone he should've taken out by the 6th. Franklin had nothing but heart and he stood up to the end. Honestly every time I've seen Joshua he fights scared. Finally I must add that Wilder must be salivating to jump in the ring against him. That would be a match up huh? One guy with nothing but a left jab against another with only the right hand. Please spare me
Wow AJ needs to retire now
AJ needs more fire than what we see here. I expected him to knock Franklin out in 4 rounds….however kudos to him for coming back.
Nothing changed with AJ. Put him in with Usyk, Wilder, Fury or even Ruiz and he would lose. This is not how he rose to be a champion. His ability to overpower his opponent and not his boxing skills got him the belts. Since the first Ruiz fight he has become this person who fight the most boring fight and has lost most of them.
Aj never looks like he wants to be there ! If him and fury ever fight it will be a joke lol
How boring ... No blood, no speed, no knock down and not even a knee on the canvas.For those who cannot forget what looked like a Bowe / Holyfield or a  Mercer / Morrison, nowadays heavy weight boxing division is heart breaking.Fury and Wilder are not better. AJ is one the most overrated boxer of the moment. Can you imagine what Iron Mike or Buster Douglas in their prime could have done to him or Usyk ? A slaughter. I am the only one who see that ?
This is no contest! It's what the Trinidadians call a Pappyshow!!!  Franklyn was just a stooge setup !
AJ vs Wilder needs to be next
Y’all hype AJ wayyyy too much lol… played it safe, the whole fight. Look almost exactly the same like his last fight. Didn’t improve on much. Just fighting with no urgency. Made no statement. He won’t win a belt again if he keep fighting like this.
Since ruiz fight , Joshua dont look the same ...
Joshua's boxing style is becoming similar to Vlad Klitschko.  But Klitschko had an unrivaled knockout jab.  And Klitschko very cunningly clinched and exhausted his opponents.  Probably AJ needs Vlad as a coach.
Its a shame AJ looks timid. He used to be a puncher until his chin got exposed and now he wants to change his style and be a boxer. You can see him overthinking so much in the ring. Hooefully him and his new trainer can work out the kinks and get him fighting more naturally again. One improvement i saw was that he didn't duck down to the oppositions height but stood up tall and kept hands up. I would say stay away from Fury, either that or fight one for a mega fight and then Jarrell Miller and call it a career
What a shambles
Joshua needs to be more aggressive
I don't know about Anthony Joshua, he's just not the same since his losses, at times he just looks unsure about himself maybe over thinking.
Yes AJ is back fighting no body
Y he fighting easy opponent
Ich weiß nicht wo die den Gegner her haben aber der Mann hat alle Schläge  von Joshua versucht mit dem Kopf zu blocken. Hände einfach seit der ersten Runde unten und immer die Distanz gehalten als wär er der größere Kämpfer..
Joshua has definitely improved skill wise perhaps he still has a long way to learn how to box.
Joshua looks so slow, he's got no chance against fury ..
Aj is 60% his potential
Yeah a.j doest look arsed anymore
Anthony Joshua has improved tremendously but he still needs to work more on himself on how to finish opponents when he catches them. Again, he needs to come out stronger at every round to build on the damages done on opponents in the round(s) before.
Joshua debió mandarlo a la lona para ganarse lo que había perdido en anteriores peleas y no lo consiguió. Ya no me convence. Salu2 de vuestro más fiel infiel Pako
Same boring big stiff robot, shuffling around, no head movement, no combinations, no idea. I could only make it 3 rounds and fell asleep. Fury absolutely toys with him, and Wilder put him into orbit inside 4.
He is back after beating a weak guy
Well done to the small ref he had a big workload parting the 2 lovers.. respect ✊🏻
AJ is a solid boxer. He’s lost 2 fights because he doesn’t dodge fights. USYK is the devil of boxing atm. No one wants to fight him! AJ did! Big respect
Low
Well done to AJ, his fitness looked great, didn’t seem to be gassing like in previous bouts, took a lot of options away from Franklin with his jabs and movement. Would still like to see him let his hands go more. But a win is a win, whether it’s a technical 12 rounds or a spectacular knockout!
The ref's white shirt become to red after 12 round
What i see here is that AJ is going back to the AJ we all knew.. knock out boxer and that is why he had to put his weight back on.
Still I dont see how AJ stands a chance against DW or TF
might aswell have fought swarmz.
AJ did great! He’s a solid fighter Franklin , Hard fight this after 2 fights where his confidence was Rock bottom. Proved how much he wants it and how big of heart he has.
Joshua perhaps the slowest boxer ever
Joshua doesn't let his hands go, furthermore his jabs aren't fluid enough, he looks kinda robotic and uncomfortable  fighting !
Franklin a worthy opponent. First half of the contest, very little head movement from AJ, distance was less than accurate and appeared reluctant to engage. After that, he appeared to gradually warm to the prospect and this was evident as the colour of his trunks took on a crimson complexion. This was a step in the right direction from AJ.
How does Hearn match him after this. He looked tentative and fearful. The snap has gone from his punches and was visibly hurt by Franklin who, judging by his record has zero power. I’ve got a feeling it will be Fury in Saudi for August. If that happens it will be a mauling and probably Joshua’s last fight
Joshua would get battered by Fury or Wilder.......he just doesn't seem to be able to knock anyone out quite simply. OK he won but is Franklin in the same league as those other boxers. We all know the answer to that one!!!
Big up for DAZN! As for joshua, one of my fav fighters, man.. now i see that he just can t compete with the best .. he rly looks like a bodybuilder .. that s all. Take care!
Joshua won the fight but Franklin won the respect!
Still can't beat Usyk.
Very biased commentary again,,,, aj still gets away with the holding and hitting
People are judging Joshua too harshly. With Franklin being an unknown commodity, everyone expected Joshua to run through him, and when that failed to come to fruition, fans were quick to start marginalizing his accomplishments. This fight doesn’t “prove” Anthony’s career is over. Instead, this fight proves Franklin is a better/more durable boxer than most expected. Joshua deserves a bit of slack in his first fight since his losses to Usyk. He needed to shake off the ring rust. It happens to most fighters. Fury had a similar difficult fight in his match against Otto Wallin, and yet he went on to complete an impressive trilogy against Deontay Wilder. It’s premature to claim Joshua needs to retire.
Aj needs removing from boxing for his own safety and mental health.
Бой не о чем
Aj wasn't even able to ko an amateur boxer like franklin who does boxe in his spare time, how can he think he could fight against the big names in the hw division? Just check the wiki paga of franklin, apart from whyte all other of his opponents don't even get a wiki page.
Andy ruiz really ruined the heavy weight division AJ will never be the same 😂🤣
Слабий бой от джошуа очень слабий
В следующий раз золотому мальчику просто грушу в ринг повесят для более убедительной победы.
I’m only a minute in. And the 1st round of the highlight package, before I watch the rest and see the outcome. Just want to point out how stiff AJ looks.  I know at times he can be robotic, but he looks overly stiff. I like him when he’s free flowing and let’s bombs go.  I’m just concerned that he has lost it because he has lost all confidence in his chin.
Joshua too overated...
Joshua is horrendous.
Below standards for AJ.. he was too careful.. he sud build on his usky fights reduce d levels..
We need Joshua vs Wilder now
Wilder will KO Anthony 😅
bit lacklustre.Fury next?
Нету прогресса пора на пенсию
Well done Franklin he fought like he wanted it. I rarely say well done to loser by the way as they lost. But he has hunger. Showed bravery and skill
AJ fight not impressive you can't compare with Gypsy King and Andy Ruiz standards.
Millions of people watching two people fighting nobody borders to seperate them i wonder what this life is turning into
the commentator only sees joshua's punches lol
AJ still takes way too many right hands. This dude while solid has no heavyweight power to make AJ pay.
AJ can never be one of the greatest boxers because he is naturally slow and it's not something one can acquire through rigorous training. He also has a glass jaw, pain gets to him easily. The things going for him are his stamina, his power and his build. All he got in this fight is just a win. There is nothing special about the fight nor his performance. If he fights Usyk, Wilder or Fury today, he will still get beat.
Ajs is finished
Joshua came to America to get some soul; Southern Soul that is…..and he wasn’t stiff in this fight.  In two more camps and fights under Derrick James he may become a “Man Down” heavyweight again!
AJ's reach and heigh is the problem for Franklin
Fair play to Franklin,he didn't rollover like most fat American fighters 🤜🤛👊 Aj looking a level below the top tier now,Fury would play with him for 12 rounds
All the positive AJ comments are by Nigerian scammers. AJ fought a very average boxer who doesn’t even have his own Wikipedia page. Any other elite heavyweight such as Tyson or Wilder would absolutely destroy AJ.
Crazy u saw no promotion at all on this fight
Wasn't even a knock out.. This should feel like a loss to Joshua..  I was expecting more
Andy Ruiz ruined this man.
This was nice fight i pass out about 10 times watching this boooring thing
Aj is improved....but I think he is still too slow, lacks movement. He is a standing target for a quicker, higher work rate boxer.
Back fighting bums
AJ has the physical tools and resources to be a champ, but, mentally he is not strong.
When the referee; At the end of the fight, he looks more like a butcher than a boxing referee.
They threw Franklin to the wolves and he nearly survived 🤦‍♂️
Has anyone ever heard of Franklin before this match up………no = tin can
I dint even know he was fighting lol
Joshua can be glad it wasnt Wilder!
Aj vs Wilder would be a awesome fight
Tyson Fury is scared of Usyk.
AJ = 🐔
Wish AJ was more consistent with the jab,double and triple it to get in range
Anthony Joshua copying deontay wilder return.. and way worse fashion btw.. Anthony completely ruined his career
I ask myself why did A.J helped Franklin to remain on his feet after delivery body shots in 2.44 min in the video
AJ so slow🥱🥱🥱🥱
Nothing new for AJ..
Started off well, then devolved into a clinching fiesta after the sixth
I think Joshua has found his level…
Gypsy king And wilder knockout dudes like that 1st time Joshua fought A top fighter he lost In the loft again That dude early almost nailing him with rights He's gonna get knocked out That's why we watch , And thank you for posting this very well done
Was this tonight
You guys are idiots labelling a fight - 'AJ is back' What about te people who are jumping onto Youtube to watch the fight without spoilers.
You could see Joshua's boxing maturity in this fight. I was very surprised he took the shots he did. Franklin was super durable as well.
AJ is done for, he is getting sparked out when he faces fury if it ever happens
Imagine mike tyson vs Joshua 😅 absolute 1st round destruction
Joshua looks and speaks like a robot 😴😴😴
the king is back what ever happen I love you Joshua such energy present in all your fights no where else to find it
AJ is a back to being par...his performance was satisfactory but nothing spectacular.  He will still lose to the elite fighters in his division.
Super A.J
Aj pukul langsung rangkul, menyedihkan
Joshusa should fight wilder
Джошуа стал похож на Владимира Кличко,тот же джеб и захваты
AJ is 🗑.....Andy really took his soul
AJ has lost his confidence tbh  Glad he took this fight home🎉❤
Wilder stages his KOs againts friends, coaches and sparring partners. Credits to AJ who decided to have a proper fight for his comeback
I didn't no it was April fools day
Aj is finished hang ya gloves up 👏 respect to Franklin ,he's been beat off Ruiz,uysek twice ,come on
Aj is a boring fighter to watch
Nice 🧤  gloves
Joshua still 🍏
brilliant fight
Coach Derrick James all the way
Its not strange that usyk wins, he moves way to slow. Telegraphing shots etc
Inevitable and boring
Joshua is to Stiff
Joshua is more composed in this fight , credit to him
I was a Joshua fan but then i realized he is not a real boxer he is a coward that avoid fighting real boxers like fury and wilder not gave the fans what they want
AJ is not back
BLESS BE THE LORSD FOR ALLOWING ME TO SEE THE LIKES OF ALI,TYSON,HOLY FIELD, FOREMAN AND THE REST ...   THE DIVISOIN CUTRENTLY NOW SHD BE SCRAPPED..ITS JUST FULL OF JOKERS WHO HAVE NO BUSINESS IN BOXING...THAT AJ IS FINISHED
Hopefully
LOL wants Fury...Michael B Jordan would KO AJ🤣🤣🤣
I came here expecting people to down on AJ for not getting the stoppage but everyone is showing love. I hope he takes it to heart the same way he let the hate get to him. He’s still the same guy from the Klitschko fight that can possibly stop anyone and pull himself off the canvas to do it if need be. He just needs that confidence back.
As of right now,...I can't see AJ beating Wilder nor Fury......
He washed up
I feel like if AJ just let his hands go a bit more he can beat anyone. I think his mind gets the best of him and he needs a coach that settles him down and notices when he needs the push. And then he can beat most fighters. Personally I think he ends Wilders career with a devastating KO if he stays pushing out the combos. If he stops throwing he’s gonna be in trouble.
Can't believe all the positive comments, to me he looked stiff and unsure of himself
Bruh that tap by AJ at the end of 11th somebody gotta explain that to me lol
That fight was trash😂 Wilder would smoke AJ
Aj looked like a giant compared to both the reff and franklin 🤣 . Franklin did well . Aj just seemed to have way more power behind his shots . Franklin did well to keep goin after takin all them shots tho . Do think he needs bigger competition then this guy tho
AJ doesn't stand a chance against Fury.
Joshua lost his fire and desire......He has to fight against wilder and fury  and beat them to be a top fighter again
Bore fest....
AJ is such a fraud, terrible boxer
Jhesua no sabe boxear
Lame
Very unimpressive win for Joshua. Dude should be walking circles around Franklin. Franklin isn’t even ranked in the top 20 yet AJ couldn’t put him away. AJ’s peak has passed
AJ has Gone
Will never smell a title again
Joshua improving you can see it .. went back to basics
Joshua hasn't improved one bit! He concedes far too many hits! Mike Tyson would knock out the Franklin in the second round! Joshua won't be world champion anymore! Sorry that's how I see it.
Whats this...friends and family.. He IS BORING AS..
AJ didn’t look explosive early and also needs a bit more head movement, he was clearly rusty.  With that being I got him winning this fight clearly.
ANTHONY JOSHUA vs DEONTAY WILDER!!!!!!
Yawn!!
AJ looks slow!!  I have seen him struggle with small throughout his career
Да Усик добре Джошуа деморалізуавав,до цих пір не може відійти.СЛАБАК,мігби кращий бій показати,а йому ой як це було б важливо.
Franklin won that fight
Tyson fury would pummel AJ or Franklin rather easily going by that fight, neither are anywhere near the gypsy kings level
Am i the only one who thinks Aj has lost that hunger for boxing, i might be wrong but i mean look at him and look at the end announcing the winner
Cieniaka dostał to wygrał i tak nic nie pokazał
These comments seem filtered. If usain bolt offered to race someone 2 seconds slower we wouldnt want to watch it. Why we letting them avoid eachother? The best should fight the best.
I can’t gage AJs improvement against a man who works part time in a factory 🤷🏽‍♂️
Aj looked better but still like he’s in between styles and is thinking about his own technique rather than just flowing
Anthony Joshua fight wasn't impressed at all.. 😊
After surviving 12 rounds, both fighters have great performances. Joshua have a great jab, having the skills, and strength against Franklin, while Franklin got the speed with his jabs towards Joshua. And both fighters carry both distance and movement. We finally know that AJ won by unanimous decision.   Congratulations to AJ for the win 🏆
Boxing is casual.
Unconvincing af
AJ is so bad. Too many flaws
AJ didn't want the knockout. he probably wanted the rounds under his belt
I'm surprised the ref didn't deduct a point from AJ  he had his left arm behind Franklin's head all the time pulling him down so he could get his upper cut,  his jab worked perfectly though,  but honestly speaking against the like of wilder or fury he wouldn't stant a chance
Joshua can't win a fury fight
who's blood is it on joshua's trunks ... his or franklins
If only AJ has quick successive shots, he probably would have been unstoppable
Joshua should've been a body builder, dude slower than Frank Bruno
Anthony Joshua is a confused boxer. Not sure if what to do. His body language is as though he doesn't want to be there.
Aj‘s fights are boring
AJ look like stirred fried ish.. Boxing 101 boxer.. Look like his first fight!😂
Franklin did his homework well, studying the Ruiz upset to throw fast counters but AJ was able to manage.
A win is a win but aj is not exciting to watch, should be knocking a ranked 30 something out in under 4 rounds if he wants to compete against wilder, fury, usyk. His next fight needs to be joe joyce and I recon he'll lose.
A.j. fought much better, just needs to throw combos when he can. Not just ones and twos. Maybe a one - two at least
You cannot put AJ in a ring with Deontay Wilder, fighting like this. The fight wont last 5 minutes
Average
Whatever, don't care who won.
Congratulations  AJ❤
Congratz AJ🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻
Pertandingan membosankan.
AJ is still too much of a nice guy in the ring. He only boxes better when he's angry. Aggression is a constant requirement and for winning.
Joshua is garbage 😂 like watching a robot😂why don't he fight fury ??
Great one AJ, I'm expecting a KO. More strength brother
AJ , sure fights tentatively. I still think Wilder blasts him out in a few rounds. He gets hit by a big puncher, AJ will be spitting out his mouthpiece looking for a place to hide.
Next, Deontay Wilder.
DAZN what happened to one price every fight ? We have to subscribe and pay PPV.  And also making people phone a premium rate phone number to cancel subscription is not cool
Best heavy weight Jared Anderson he better then these guys ijs
He was expected to ko Franklin in under 4 rounds. No chance
He's back with a spectacular win 🤣🤢
ELITE BOXERS HAVE FOOTWORK SWAG COMBINATIONS AND FLAIR I DONT SEE IT HERE
Boring
Aj wouldn’t last with Tyson fury
desde que peleó con uzyk, joshua ya no es nada super lento falta de combinaciones
Big respect to both fighters🙏🙏🙏🙏
Nothing new
WILDER VS JOSHUA NOTHING ELSE MAKES SENSE
This is Anthony level! Wilder or Fury he's getting knocked the fk out!
Ysik destroyed soul of AJ
Never been the same since his loss to Ruiz
I wouldn’t say he’s back a big boxer like AJ against a small bloke should of knocked him out
Джошуа победит и Фьюри и Уальдера , после Усика его больше никто не победит .
AJ..the only boxer ive ever watched who cant throw a decent combination..
AJ has been a huge success for himself and the sport but its time to retire. Fury and Wilder should be begging to fight AJ as he hasn't the fire anymore and is there for the taking.
Lol, AJ gets tagged by Deontay or Tyson with that right hand light this guy did, it’s lights out. Not impressive at all. For a top tier fighter(supposedly) to be taken 12 rounds by this guy……… AJ just looking for a Payday lol.
Compilation was so fast....kudooos
AJ looks wooden most of the time. 🪵
A cautious return for AJ against a dangerous and underrated fighter in Franklin. I'm just not sure what happens for him now. I don't think he beats Fury or Wilder and I'm not sure he even beats Joyce now to be honest. Some people say he was measured tonight but I thought he looked disinterested and not like a man who's desperate to get his belts back. Maybe Dillian is the man who can bring the more aggressive AJ back out but who knows. As a side note... Franklin vs Ruiz jr would be a fight I'd love to see!
Franklin is the shortest 6ft2 man ive ever seen
LOL
I love how AJ always beats loudmouths.  1. Whyte 2. Martin 3. Franklin  4. Breazele   He KOed 3 of those guys.
Those score cards are jokes. I mean Tony bellew as a judge in Joshua's fight? Come on.
Mr Muscles must continue to run away from the Gypsy king. Just fight the small fighters
What a boring fight, Am sure Wilder can knock out both of them
Commentators are right, Joshua throws punches from a static position? How does he expect to knock anyone out.
HE LOOKS GREAT AGAINST A CERTAIN CALIBER OF FIGHTER
Wilder is going to knock AJ's head off.
congrats AJ
AJ still not fit to fight against Fury
What's with the speeding up in places
That was horrible
СлабО , Неубедительно, Ничья...🤪
Joshua has not daydream looking at Derrick a nasty man will swing on him. I like that he is framing and punching though back to basics.
Was AJ gassed out from round 10??
if he thinks he has a chance against fury he is deluded and lost the plot
🥱😴
Keep climbing towards your goals
DAZN he's back😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I used to love boxing. Todays heavyweights are making me hate it. Randomly pick any heavyweight from the 70/80/90's and they would be champ in this era. Today we have a merry-go-round of five top tier boxers who don't want to fight each other.
AJ's cleaning his boxing up big time
More sidestepping and ducking the real fights
Eddie paid him to lose
AJ comes up against any major opponents he is going down! AJ is back???? Really....
Proved he's a spent force. Get in the ring with Joe Joyce ya bums!
Why is AJ fighting all of these no name guys, to be the best you have to beat the best
AJ looks terrific... fights mediocre
These commentators are super deceptive be lieing
Two tomato cans slugging it out.
I was wrong! After watching this fight  I realize AJ wouldn't get knocked out by Fury in the 5th round. I definitely underestimated him. He'd at least make it to the 6th before getting K'od.
Hold up how all 7 rnds went to josh that sound bios brah Franklin standing toe to toe and he's the smaller man I believe it's a little closer ,or maybe I have to go watch the full fight not these clips
Joshua fights like a granny
the only way aj becomes champ again is when the real boxers retire. My guy looks like a shell of himself out there.
Franklin is a worrior, Joshua can do better than that but he's still lazy, he's not throwing more punches, I think he's too heavy...
Aj was having a great difficulty in dominating a smaller guy which just tells you he’s not ready for Tyson fury
well that roofer Franklin made a few quid im pleased for him held his own thanks dazn 👍
Need to see Ashley raksu vs Anthony joshua
Congratulations champ Anthony
Судья поц,позволял нарушать середнячку джошуа
Joshua slow asf😅. I dont see him messing wit the big guys anymore.
AJ looks awkward and fighting like this is very boring because he's worried he might get KO again,
I'd pay to watch Wilder put AJ into the Matrix with one punch in first round
Great fight from both fighters and great recovery from AJ. He now need to defend counter punches better, he meets a heavy hitter then it's lights out.
Joshua overrated 🥊
I'm sorry but Joshua just doesn't improve😢
Who's excited for Fury vs Chisora 4 ?
He lost
DAZN might have the most biased commentary team and pundits
AJ is now 2 wins out of last 5 performances.
Really not impressed. A whole lot of single shots from Joshua, no confidence to commit to the combination, unsure of his chin, stiff legs (as always). He actually looked way more loose and fluid in the Usyk 2 fight.   Joshua as a heavyweight would be just about top 15 in the 80’s or 90’s. Frank Bruno was a much better fighter, just in the wrong era.   Andy Ruiz took something from his soul that night, and the rest of his soul went in that bizarre embarrasing rant post Usyk 2.   What can you say now really, Fury would absolutely annihilate Joshua.
Who agree with me that Deontay wilder with knock down AJ . Tell us reason why Deontay will not KO AJ. Am a fan of AJ but am not impressed since his fought usyk, though little improvement now but Deontay has the fire and he's a merciless beast in the Ring
For me AJ has become mechanical. Slow. His punches are seen. Not fast enough. Don’t think he can be at the top again. Should think of retirement. His time has past. Still  wishing him all the best though
I forgot how boring boxing was.
Está empezando desde cero Anthony Joshua // no está en su momento de boxeo le falta más ser técnico y dar más golpes  se queda mucho Joshua
I didn’t see AJ is back… I saw Aj is still not ready for Wilder, Fury and of course Usyk. He was getting popped with shots that Wilder would put him to sleep with. He looks timid and scared still instead. Just my opinion
Can someone explain why Antony's shorts changed colour
AJ just wanted to keep his fans entertained. Otherwise he would have KO Franklin in Round 3
Robbery, Joshua just isn’t the same after getting knocked out by Andy Ruiz! 😂
I want to see AJ vs Joseph Parker 2
This is the most impressive fight I've seen from AJ. He stayed disciplined, fought behind his jab and didn't abandon his game plan. Well done
AJ needs more fluidity with his punches and his movements need to be more elusive. He needs to follow up with his punches, bite down and dig in. He fights like hes scared to hurt somebody
Fury would destroy AJ. AJ looked average  in a boring fight. I was expecting a KO.
AJ-Robotica is back with another snoozefest. The casual fans are praising him for another hohum bout. This is supposed to be championship calibre boxing but since the most overrated champion of the 21 century was involved the casuals are very satisfied.😂
Fabio Wardley beats Joshua imo.
Legit looks like hes fighting his lil bro 😂
😂🤣
Hello  bhai log mara chennal  ka name RAJNISH ANSH VLOGS.HA
Anthony Joshua looked like Wladimir Klitschko.
Fury would wipe both out easy
That's the fight
Wilder go zniszczy
Derik James must’ve installed a new gas tank on AJ huh. Nice to see there’s still some time left in the old engine lol. FairPlay
Joshua is just a level 1 one fighter. No tricks, no nothing...can't win fans fighting like this
aj didnt even drop the guy. wilder and tyson will knock him out aj aint ready didnt show anything in this fight
The AJ of 6 years ago would have beaten this AJ. Wilder may be less skilled but he is faster and less cautious.  Sometimes being over cautious and too composed can loose you the fight, especially if your fighting a pro offensive fighter.  Can make you easier to read.
Aj is trash, Franklin would definitely beat him in a rematch.
Id like to see Joshua vs Joyce
Tbh this was a boring fight aj reached his peak, he’s to stiff for usyk and fury
At the weigh in you could tell AJ is the A side. The American would have had to knock AJ out to win this fight. No other way.
The ref couldn't decide who he wanted to fight. Had his guard up ready
Sorry but boring fight.  Nothing exciting really happen. Each round was the same.
A.J. RESPETO
Trash fight these dudes are done
Boring fight ... They should throw hooks left & right... Forget the jabs !
I’m an AJ fan he as all the attributes to be the best of the best but I think this all mental. He is boring to watch now. He needs a trainer that will make him more aggressive and he has to have that dog in him if he really wants to come back into the picture but is just a shadow in the heavyweight scene now.
This is not box, it is a study of it. Waiting for counters, faking out of the moment, something was wrong. I don't like this new version of Anthony but if this is the only way to keep his presence in the field, so be it. There is somebody who would be able to beat both of these guys in the same night. We all know who is, Tyson Fury.
NGL Joshua looks very very stiff, not fluid at all, never seen him this way
ring announcer is disgusting.
I wish I had Joshua physic. That fight would of been over in the 1st round. He fights scared with no confidence. He needs to go to the hood for a few weeks. Or train with Mike Tyson  something
AJ fought a out of shape short boxer with 21 fights and just lost do Duhlian Whyte...AJ needs to just take the Wilder fight so he can get blasted into retirement.
Can't believe AJ beat Klitchko,how though...he's not a boxer
Joshua Aka frank bruno
Lacklustre performance from AJ. I don’t think he still has the qualities to be a world champion.
ถ้าเจอไวเดอร์ของผมนี่AJมีเสียมวยเลิกมวยแน่นอน
Franklin got robbed he won that
The fight was extremely unintertaining to say the least!!
Perfect time for Joshua vs Wilder.
AJ has no killer in him .  He should have put him a way in 6 rounds .  But he couldn’t do it .  Boring fight .  Who is Franklin ? Never heard of him .  All respects to Franklin for taking on AJ .
Franklin should have let his hands go earlier he would have won I'm sure of it
I can't watch the same after the belt throwing,   I just can't 😔
Болею за Джошуа, но классный боксер этот Франклин, поежде всего человек.. добрый. Не хочется крови
НЕ ВЫРУБЛЮ УДАРОМ, ТАК ПЕРЕБОРЮ ИЛИ ЗАБОДАЮ !😂
Boring fight
Man you couldn't give me AJ size and built and think I wouldn't dominate it's like he's unsure of himself
What a great fight from AJ this time. Nice hot, hard jabs. Took his time and punched heavily. It’s a perfect reserved fight. He doesn’t need to exhaust all of his new skills and power on this Guy. He’d do that with the top fighters ahead. I like that strategy, that would pull Fury or Wilder forward with expectations of a lacking performance where they’d then get the shocks of their life. I think he’s back, you could tell from those confident Punches. Congratulations AJ
I miss Mike Tyson's fights. 💪💪💪 Tonight's fight was so boring!
Boxing is all fixed especially with the money fighters
Joshua is stiff as F%$k
Joshua's hype is over. His behavior at the end of the fight was absolutely disgusting.
2:45 that punch gave Joshua a nose bleed.
Bra, Joshua is big for nothing
Not a bad fight atall but there is no way he would stand a chance against Tyson fury.
Looks a little gun shy to me!
I said this one time Aj congratulations...but stay  far awake from wilder he is giving you the ko of your life after that RIP
I think Franklin won! AJ boxed as though he was so scared, i only saw 4 right hands in these entire "highlights" his jab is slow n everything about him from jab to movement is too static n Predictable!  He scrapped this, Franklin was unlucky! I bet Hearn bought the judges anyway, boxing is corrupt u can't trust anyone or anything!🤣🤣🤣
Aj is trash just a mouthy bully who thinks hes some gangsta yet hes scared to get hit and just hugs 24 7
Why’s AJ so big but can’t knockdown or ko anyone? Bros a HW and built like a tank yet can’t connect properly. He’s so slow at bringing back his punches cos he swings too far out but cmon man you can’t get bloodied up by these guys if you wanna be champ
Even if he won, I saw Aj shocked.
Anthony Joshua
He has made me proud.... Tyson where a you dunker ...where a you duck
AJ is so weak
This fight was trash man
IMO Joshua's like a rock'em sock'em not saying he can't compete but so robotic.
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
If your favourite ride in the fair ground is the carasoul then this picnic is for you.
The issue is that Joshua can't take a punch and he fully knows this. Fury or Wilder will actually demolish him.
Creo que le haría mejor a AJ en levantamiento de pesas😅 Está más trinco que un levantador de pesas😂
the fight was not all that very slow not enough punches all defensive Fell asleep halfway through the fight fa real hats of to Franklin
It's over for Joshua no ko ,& boring safe fight
AJ hasn’t been the same since that awkward blow from Ruiz in the 1st bout. He seems slower, lost his edge, weak guard and seems to be getting hurt more and more with every fight, it’s always the nose.
Joshua should increase the speed in order to fight these two people fury and wilder
AJ has not changed one bit no head or body movement's and still seems scared to take punches or let go with punches
Aj is back. 😂😂😂, now that is funny. Seen more aggression in a little girl than aj now. Snooze fest mate simple as
Joshua don’t got nothing against wider
Another size mismatch but the American is the more skilled fighter.
Watching Joshua show faints is amazing.
Nice win for AJ. Fury vs Joshua May never really happen. I wouldn’t mind watch AJ vs Wilder. Def fireworks there!!!
Joshua getting better in the clinch
People love to hate, that spence style fits AJ beautifully, give it time
Joshua is not a Champ quality guy. I would rank him just above Otto Whalen. I think Joshua deserve a third fight with the fat Mexican.
To me, Joshua didn't look too bad. Dont write him off just yet!
Trilogy with Ruiz needs to happen next to humble him some more, he hasn’t learned enough
Fury will dismember Joshua.
Aj is over
You gotta love how the British commentators are ignoring the punches landed by Franklin
Andy really damaged him. He’s simply not the same person since his loss. He needs to hang on the gloves.
Earlier  on tonight I watched   Gary   Mason  vs  Hughroy  Currie for the British  title , and that was a more  entertaining  fight
I like Joshua as a fighter and person, but he would get knocked out by fury
Like watching a mummy movie in the 70s. Aj is very overrated and very boring, and static. his only asset is size
AJ is over, Ruiz destroyed his career...
Joshua? Tu as perdu ton honneur ? C’est plus de la boxe mais tu fais de la danse classique 😮😅 désolé tu n’es plus un boxeur, on voit mentalement tu n’es plus là…. Tu es l’ombre de toi même c triste 😞 pffff
I was really hoping AJ was going to lose again.. 🙁
AJ is back!!! 😂😂😂 the guy he is fighting is small asf
Haters will hate on Joshua no matter what he does.. displays of jealousy at it's best
Joshua could do with lennox Lewis in his camp learn from a great fighter
Prior to this I saw some highlights of a prime Larry Holmes.  These heavyweights are a joke 🤣
i like joshua, but something in his eyes tells me his heart is no longer truly in this. all this talk of the ruiz ko changing him seems to be true- he took away that twinkle in his eye; that bounce in his step; that hunger in his gut. he truly does seem afraid to "let go", and i'm not entirely sure why, or what the connection to having suffered that ko is, because he's such a big, powerful, imposing guy. his issue isn't so much his training (though he could be quicker), it's psychological- dude needs a special therapist to get over this. i do believe he can still remain a top contender and possibly even champ with the right help.
Best Joshua fight yet. He showed determination discipline and skill against much better opponent. Well done! Hopefully one day he can get the title fight! Let's go AJ
He looks great
After that performance, I don't see him beating Deontay Wilder. Wilder would be too fast and too powerful for AJ to handle.
Fury & Wilder would smash Joshua . Joshua was tired after 2nd rd smh
AJ needs to be more explosive in all the rounds
Very poor footwork from AJ, static.
Its a NO Knock down AJ is over mate
Nice win for AJ, but I see him getting really hurt if he fights any of the top 3 heavyweights with this level of skill
If the highlights was this slow wat abt the whole fight
AJ is one more loss away from being a boxing analyst/ commentator
антоха! перчатки на гвоздь.
Glad I didn't pay for it and waited for YouTube.  I don't mean any disrespect but aj has never been the same since ruiz just doesn't look like he really wants it anymore
Kudos to Franklin to looking relaxed af in there.  You would think Franklin been in the limelight just as long as Joshua the way he was relaxed in there.  Joshua definitely did what he had to do obviously.  But he didn't look relax at all in there tonight except the last 2-3rds
Joshua need to retire
Joshua needs to let his hands go looks like Amateur boxing
AJ would KO my refrigerator but not my moving doll.
Someone should tell AJ to watch Rocky 3 - this is the worst fight I've seen - no passion or commitment from AJ, No desire at all... Dare I say it - no Eye of the Tiger.... Looks like he doesn't want to be in there......
Since he left Robert Mcraken it seems like he don’t throw combinations anymore
AJ actually cannon box.
Trash 😂😂😂😂😂
Дайте Бокс по смотреть надоели вы с со своими рекламами
Джошуа дохляк
Ferdinand the bull. He looks so tough but Ferdinand doesn't want to hurt anybody.
AJ too slow...you lucky for winning. Your opponent too small. You need new trainer and cut down on weight. Be a little quicker next fight.
AJ is boring to watch now,he never gets back after Ruiz defeat though, man needs to retire and probably make a come back like Fury.
Franklins a better fighter than ppl give him credit for Aj boxed well when I saw his weight I bet on Franklin 😂 but he looked better than I’ve seen in the past think franklins a lot better than most think can Aj get back nope I don’t think so problem is Ruiz exposed him he doesn’t react well to aggression klitchko should of got him out there he was in Disneyland for a long time takham caused him huge problems warning signs and limits have long been obvious  Ruiz took away his own self belief now everyone with grit fancies it if they can hurt him .
Sorry AJ, (and with all necessary respect) but on this showing *Fury will retire you* . Just saying and not hating ok.
Im a AJ fan but i have to keep it real. Im glad he won i was rooting for him but i hope he steps up his game. Franklin is not a bad fighter but in my opinion is someone aj should have ko'd before the 11th round. Either way it was an alright fight
I can’t watch Joshua anymore. He’s absolutely nothing special.
AJ saying he on his way back up and regaining titles not going by that performance hes not
He needs to fight Usyk and avenge the lost he is ready!!!!
Another AJ snooze fest. No chance he beats fury or wilder
Maybe back with a win, but vs a random smaller HW not ranked - imagine what Tyson Fury would have done to this dude AJ just got a decision on - AJ not impressive in the clinch like spots and no killer instinct seen tonight - ps still ticked off Fury not gong for the Uysyk fight...
Congratulations to you my brother AJ. A win is a win. Slow and steady wins the race they say, I don't care what people say. It is easier to judge when you're not the one directly involved. Maximum respect bruv.
I don't think much of this heavyweight era. Literally garbage like the Klitschko era because nobody is actually fighting each other and they're not even active... Neither Joshua, Fury, Wilder and Usyk has beaten multiple all time greats, champions or hall of famers...
Still holding back of head to land uppercut...
Goes to show just how much better Tyson is than all these Heavyweights.
Wilder would knock out aj
Joshua mega low boxer pls leave the ring 😢😢😢😢
I think something happened to AJ nose which caused him to hold back somewhat.
Congrat to Aj, but I'm not impressed with the head movement, defence looks vulnerable and that would be a weak point against any technical n experienced fighter. Plus his Confidence level, it hasn't been the same since the KO against Andy Ruiz
JOSHUA is so scared to fight it’s embarrassing. Ruiz ended him
Joshua just doesn’t have that beast side … it’s kind of sad ..
The old AJ is back and better more of a boxer boxer i see exactly what he's doing
ㅠㅠ
I hate to say it but that was a terrible performance, I think it's time to accept old aj isn't coming back
if those were the highlights the fight wasn’t up to much. Joshua is so frustrating all the tools and still hasn’t figured it out yet. He’s very robotic the way he sets up.
Joshua fighting like this is his first pro fight. I really hope we see him against Wilder so Wilder knocks him into oblivion
He fight scared oh poor Joshua
Anthony don’t look happy
There’s something mentally holding AJ back..
AJ just can’t protect himself from those counter punches. What does he need to do to improve in this area of his defense?
AJ was fighting last night 😳 who even watched this guy 🤣
AJ is not a boxer he should retire I believe he is tired
AJ is a shot fighter, the lose to the chubby lad has made him a jab fighter and the fear of getting knocked out, when he gets a fight with anyone decent fighter game over
Save the AJ career fight!! One way result as expected.
A fighter that throws both fists will always beat the 1 armed bandit, needs to let that right hand go abit more
Back😂😂😂
Was AJ on a remote control, looked like a xbox game
Too much lazy jab and right hand from AJ with this skill he should retire or rebuild his skills and mentality.
Just been watching since round 5 and I see some improvements from Anthony Joshua, but he definitely seems to be going thru a crisis after his few losses far as his mental it's clear as day 😔.... I still think he's a descent boxer for a HUGE heavey weight and I can't wait to see him continue to grow more despite the critics people keep talking about...like keep bringing up Luiz...So he beat him but eve Luiz he  eve got got dropped so let it go and let this man grow back to who we all did including my self but  thought of him in being the next boxing prospect 🤷.... second note I must add/and ask? But I'm sorry but who in they rite mind alowed that older man in there to ref them two gient & why🤦😑 anyway hope everybody injoyed the fight and do anyone still want to see Anthony vs wilder 🖐️ I still do.
Joshua looks very uncomfortable in him self that was a dominant performance but should never of gone the 12 rounds hopefully back to bigger things in time 💯 needs to get his confidence back
Another trash performance by aj usyk has shown there are levels to this sport
Can you imagine prime Mike Tyson vs Joshua? Tyson would walk right through femi.
I've got respect for AJ and his HW resume is top tier. But realistically I don't see what he can do with wilder, fury or usyk. They are the fights that matter for him but I don't think he's at the skill level of fury or usyk and wilder is too aggressive, unpredictable and has the bomb right hand. It's a shame since he's the only modern HW with such a deep resume  (comparatively) but he's just not at that level imo.
It’s almost like aj doesn’t work on his footwork, he moves back in a straight line far too often
Won by points...mehhh
AJ’s movement is so predictable and slow. No foot work. He needs to do more. He tired out so quickly round 4-5 or so. I love dude so much but he is far from the top heavies of this era at the mo.
Aj like your attitude and all but truth be told man you need to put boxing to rest your big for nothing small dude took you to a decision this should of been a easy fight for you and couldn’t even drop the man sad 😢
He gotta hang it up ⬆️ Joshua needs to stick to body building foreals
I've saod for years, nothing personal, Joshua is not a top tier fighter...at all.
How was Joshua ever a champion? 😂
Aj  18stone + fam  Wanted a win got it not in the way he needed is abit onw dimensional robotic. Coming bk after a couple of loses.did well Franklin can fight, aj didn't gas out by round 4/5 like normal , new trainer as done wonders with him, I think he boxed a clever fight. But tyson fury is just another one step for aj one giant step for man kind , wilder beats him to the 1Bomb any month in May.  I hope he can win another world title , he looked very focused , but nearly went on a mad one again after the bell, come on aj get a grip 🎉🎉🎉
Aj Is just being lazy in the fight even I could see every move he's making he has to be offensive and fast he has the power
All you haters with negative criticism can cry a river. Joshua won after 12rds with a career high weight. He would beat any of your fighters and you don't like it. Congrats to both men.
What happen to the Joshua that fought Klitschko, Whyte, Takam, Povetkin etc?
Honestly, the old AJ will never be back.Andy Ruiz has taken a piece of his soul he'll never get back. It truly saddens me to say this. This is one of the worst he's looked. Looked like a freakin robot that had zero confidence!
AJ getting hit too much... He needs to fight bigger.
what happened to his power this is weird af
AJ is finished.
Franklin looks like a better version of bermaine sterverne
As someone who really likes Anthony please leave the sport right now and enjoy the rest of your life from the side of the ring it's a miracle that a mummy style fighter can reach that far in boxing
Andy ruiz messed that boy up
You can see Joshua has no confidence and played it way too safe, considering it was super heavyweight against heavyweight. He wasn't enjoying being in there & he was easy to hit because of little to no head movement. This can't be about the payday, surely?
The only Joshua that would stand a chance against Fury or Wilder, is the Joshua of before the first Luiz fight... The man is done now
AJ is boring, he either needs to retire or need to equip him with some serious trainers, Fury or Wilder would make him look like easy work let alone put him to sleep!
Wow didn't even know he fought tonight
I see why Aj won’t fight wilder
Another snooze fest
2 heavyweights 12 rounds no damage 😂😂😂
JOSHUA LOOKS SLOW AF
I like how Joshua stays calm and patience!
Pleased I didn’t pay to watch this
Not his best but still a win. Still not flexible
Joshua hands ✋️ heavy,  he don't release shot, if he meet fury, RIP 100%, Joshua will not reach round 5 like this with fury
Fury will knock Joshua out in 4 rounds
When Anthony Joshua let's his hands go your 💀
Not impressed
The old AJ that I used to know got lost btwn Ruiz & Usyk.
This Joshua isn’t beating a lot of the top heavyweights! Frankly if I was his relative, I’ll strongly urge him to retire. Doesn’t need the money and achieved so much with so little.
Tyson Furry will retire him
Welcome back Joshua
Big for nothing
Looks like an amateur boxer with less than 10fights
No knockout he ain’t back yet he too big to not knock a guy out.
Have told him that he needs to be more of an aggressive fighter, there's no calmness in the ring. Guess he will have more confident in himself now because it seems like he lost it since the time he fought Ruiz.
Give Joshua some credit casuals!! He actually looke sharp in this fight!! The guy is just warming up! He is coming after 2 losses to one of the best heavyweight in Usyk right now! He will quickly gain momentum and claim back the lada again. Mark my words!!  Just wait and see.
Congratulations to both men. AJ faced an enormous amount of pressure, which is difficult to comprehend unless you've been in a similar situation. Meanwhile, Franklin had everything to gain and nothing to lose. Boxing is a sport that's vastly different from what it may appear to be from outside the ring. Respect to both men! 🥊
If his training team could just work on his head and upper body movement that would be great. He looks at times as if he’s fighting with a broomstick up his a$$.
Joshua is as fast as Joyce in this match. What happened to the man....
Couldn’t care less about Joshua he’s never gonna be a heavyweight champion again.
Still i did  not see more skills for Anthony, I am not fun of boxing but I like frankly he was fast and great movement skills, I like to see the boxer to get punch and nocked down on the floor, that will convince me to accept the winner, I did not see the winner in this match
Joshua looks like he doesn't want to be there.
They want Joshua to be on top but if he will face welder a,m sure he won't reach 6 round , he is not sure on himself
He cant even knock out franklin
AJ your journey has got you here. What ever you do be happy doing it fir no amount of money can make you truly content. Being content in all your decisions if you decide to leave the ring its ok. You have done a lot and succeeded.
Joshua should return to who he was before Ruiz fight and then work on slight defense.
Wilder got beat by Fury but stylistically Wilder will Knock out Joshua ..
joshua should fight wilder to regain his mojo
Joshua gets caught with looping hooks quite easily, fury would destroy him easily.
Joshua won the fight , but he didn’t fight well . Seems AJ totally loosed his confidence after KO’s from Andy and Usyk’s.
AJ is washed. Will never hold the belt again.
Joshua necesita mas técnica sobre todo de defensa
I’d like to see Jermaine Franklin vs Andy Ruiz. Guaranteed fireworks!
AJ fought like he was scared to get hit
Joshua,  the most overrated fighter ever! Embarrassing!
AJ lost his courage and self believe!! The old AJ is dead!!! now its just a regular boxer
AJ is not the same after losing with A Ruíz. If he fights with Fury, that could be his last bout
Anthony Joshua fought today in case anyone still cares
Joshua is slower than Bruno for Christ sake.
Joshua bez rewelacji, powinien go rozjebać do 3 rundy
Right now Joshua will move to pound for pound list
Pertandingan yg membosankan
He looks nothing like his old self he’s finished
AJ knows his own weakness (he doesn't know how to receive punches from his opponent) that is he's scared of being hit ..so he neede d to play safe....to contend with wilder he needs to improve
I am by no means a boxing expert and don’t box at all, BUT, AJ is finished. If this is all he has, it’s game over. Stop now and prevent the brain damage please. Sorry AJ but it is game over.
Fury, Wilder, Usyk, and in shape Ruiz beat the breaks of this version of Joshua. It's like he forgot how to finish.
Congratulations my state brother( Nigeria). But you need to work on being fast on your opponent ,1or 2 even 3 times while you're fighting.
Same old boring punch AJ far from knock out .
Joshua will be eaten alive by fury and wilder.
Franklin was cannon fodder
Plenty of Rust. It's a long Road back.
When coach tells you' "just out box him" 😂
Franklin fought well. Joshua had height and reach advantage but he wasn’t impressive, not the Joshua I saw that destroyed his opponents. The loss to Ruiz did some effect to his confidence, hope this win is a step to his redemption
I want to see AJ carried out on a stretcher after Wilder trounces him.
Poor AJ. What a weird transition to go from being a top heavyweight to being a regular boxer! I hope and pray he gets back!! AJ is a cool cat!
AJ has a long way to get to the top.
Franklin rating 34 😂😂😂 it's a guardian for a discotheque
Loads of champions onhere 😂😂😂
Ruiz took his heart
Gun-shy with no head movement will only take you so far.
😂 the steroids
Jajajajajaja
Many People talking trash 🗑. Have you ever climbed the ring to even fight a training partner in the gym ? So if not shut ur trap , because ain’t easy to throw punches 🤦🏽‍♂️
franklin nhìn giống bermane sever
The blatant commentary bias is painful to listen to
Well now that I've seen the title, why bother to watch 😂
Predictable win boring, Tyson F would smash him to bits.
Can't even get knockouts anymore. W😂washed up boxer
Boring,was it a heavy wt stuff?
Boxing nothing.
I like this new Aj
Them scored cards were well off lol how do win a round throwing rubble jab right hand or a 1-2. Stinks. Closer fight then they made out.
Aj be whispering  Let your guard down  Let me land a shot .. I'm the champ  500k pounds
There is no way AJ beats Tyson
We need Wilder v Joshua
When the joy sticks stiff asf  and can’t throw a 1,2 fluidly…
At least Franklin made it watchable honestly don't know how anybody likes to watch somebody who makes Bruno look fluid...and the creaming fkn commentators never mentioned anything Franklin did...
Joshua boxing robot
Joshua no idea boxing. Jajajajajaja.
Joshua no es espectáculo
How long do we have to wait for Joshua vs Wilder??!!
A big stiff single punch thrown at a time, who needs boocoo work or retirement.  I'm looking at this huge former Champ fighting a smaller guy but he's acting like the smaller guy  (of  heart). I was pleasantly surprised to see highlights,  even the full fight , nice.
BORING!
Looked more like a spar, AJ has lost his killer instinct sad to see!!!
Congratulations AJ but you’ve got a lot of work to do if you wanna fight the likes of Fury and Wilder
So this is the highlights? More like a lowlights... And the commentators are selling the fight so hard, they make it sound like Joshua is picking the guy apart! Lame crowd too bunch of sellouts!!!
Weird how people saying AJ is slow his feet sure but that handspeed is top top tier. In my opinion the best purely physical specimen in boxing heavyweight history
Title says Highlights… I actually didn’t see one 😂😂 Joshua is over the hill
Anybody know who won those free tickets to this fight?!
I hate hit and don't get hit. I really don't enjoy the fight. It is boxing all the way.
Great effort from Franklin 🎉
This was more entertaining than all those  useless fights Fury vs Whyte,Fury vs Chisora ,Wilder vs Helenius.AJ is the best
Aj  made too much money.. hungers gone..
AJ still feels bad he has to go for the low hanging fruits,  he had more to lose, so had to be careful, but the last might not have been heard from him. Dude is not giving up.
This is not the level he used to fight when he started this AJ
Franklin is so strong..
JOSHUA just fights so small and insecure. He really needs to move to VEGAS and join FLOYD MAYWEATHER'S TEAM and get his boxing up. His jab is just lacking any authority. He has at least a 4in reach advantage and he's just standing there still and not giving massive work to the body and face of this guy! SMH Sad waste of talent! He needs to get his confidence back up because he won't last long in the heavies fighting like this. SMH
this fight is not worth the money...poor performance when you announce a knockout
Can’t believe I’m watching aj parry a punch by pushing it all the way down to his body leaving his face fully exposed
Poor fight by Joshua....if Franklin had a longer reach,joshua would have been beaten silly Congratulations though
AJ will KO again in trilogy vs Ruiz
Andy Ruiz has Joshua’s soul
Boy don't wanna see no brown bomber period
Trash I don't think AJ is ppv too boring
What a boring fight!
a must needed win to regain back his confidence. He needs at least three fights. Outside the top ten fighters in his division, before thinking of fighting high-caliber opponents
Aj stamina trash I give him sum go in this wheelchair 🧑🏽‍🦽 🆚🚶🏽‍♂️😆
Joshua need to be aggressive. je fight like he's fearing franklin to KO him. he have to like he fought back in a way with whyte, klitchiko .
Training sessions over lol.
Aj still fighting like a computerised  Ai fighter ✅
Are they I the same weight class?
Dude doesn't like back to me. A real champion or contender will seriously trouble him. At this point, even Deontay Wilder can catch him lacking. Look at how slow Joshua's punches are. LOL
Franklin deserves credit for displaying that AJ is just average and not Elite
Two ladies. Jajajajajaja.
I notice when aj about to throw🥊. His feet heavy
I can't see the highlights 😅
joshua is such a WUSS
AJ fights like a Robot hehe
Joshua doesnt deserve at all to fight Fury. Lets be honest, Joshua is just an average boxer, be doesnt belong to the Elite
The chinese man is coming for everyone
It was his first fight after a devastating defeat. What do u expect, he did exactly what anyone with half a brain would if thought. Its called a confidence builder wow rocket science i know. Jesus 🙄🙄🙄🙄.
The largest softest man in the world. I know lots of fluffed up guys like him. Sometimes they get off the bag and actually spar with us. They have no talent. Aj had no talent only size. Franklin actually was clearly the better boxer here. Putting together combos. The difference is as he got slower, aj imposed his size.
Franklin is no longer a contender,  he has become some lame gatekeeper now And Joshua needs to stay far away as possible from Fury. Fury would demolish him.
Tyson Fury would knock AJ out
I see improvement in AJ he's starting to find his old self and when he does everyone need to watch out when he finds his beast mode
Derrick James fighters are notorious for lack of head movement, which Anthony Joshua already suffers from. Errol Spence and the Charlo boys are stiff up and down fighters that get hit clean, just like Joshua. It was the wrong choice of trainers.
Usyk was 😂😂😂 easy work for me.
Every fight always has a different approach. Nice win AJ
I thought Franklin beat Dillian Whyte and I think he beats a lot of the HWs out there. I’d like to see him against Wilder but I know that will never happen! Wilder won’t fight him!
Joshua looks very unsure of himself. Clearly his confidence is not where it once was. Secong guessing himself now. maybe if he strings a few wins together, he can regain the kind of confidence that he needs, to compete at the very top again.
DAZN total rip off you got to pay a monthly fee and buy the fights… Not for me thank you very much.
Who Little Cousin is this? Please Stop Earth. Please.
Hmmm
Anthony Joshua is a typical UK boxer (other than Fury and maybe Saunders). Straight up and down fighter. Zero head movement. Gets head with clean shots, throughout the fight. He's gun shy from the knockouts he has suffered and the losses he has accrued. He would lose again to Usyk and would lose clearly to Fury as well. He's finished.
why does Franklin keep touching his nose, almost as if to check it is bleeding but does it every few seconds since beginning of round?
Gôgle
Watching the highlights of this fight looks like Franklin was robbed again if he had a bit more power he would have knocked AJ out
Horrible announcing. I guess Joshua did enough to win, but he was tentative and stiff, and the announcers could only talk about him. Even when Franklin was busier it was more often about how Joshua was handling it, rarely about how Franklin was doing. Very poor.
AJ IS BACK....... don't make me laugh, the guy has to come a fair way before he gets to where he was. don't get me wrong I hope he does come back strong but idk man we will see.
Guy is So Schott!!$
Joshua has lost his knockout power. I think his championship days are behind  him. 🤔
AJ is a bullet scared of killing
Joshua just a business fighter.
U stil got it champ welcome back
Big win for AJ, huge improvement on work rate and stamina
You can tell if a boxer pressures AJ , he had no defence. Very low on confidence.
The commentator z biased
Joshua a broken man since Usyk
Joshua has no power
What a size advantage ..!! Da big bozz send a FEEDER for his beloved son
Sad and out of touch
Aj vs Dante wilder
Joshua faught a better fight here, than with Usyk
Tyson .will knock him out  very quickly
Js vậy thôi.mai vẫn không phải là đối thủ xứng tầm của fury....fury vô đối rồi
boxing is more rigged and scripted than wwe
Look at Franklin's passion go lol.
Just like his master - Eddie Hearn .   No substance , boring
Even though he has a lead. Joshua tends 2 fade in the later rounds, needs 2 be in better condition if he plans on beating Fury, if the fight ever happens
Franklin vs Ruiz ????
Aj ain’t getting nun of his belts back fighting like that against a taxi driver
Fury would destroy Joshua he’s looks terrible
AJ actually has a great jab
Boring
Over cautiousness
AJ the bigger version of Adrian Bronner without all the talk and bling! They both talk change n then fight like robots without letting there hands go
Better retire before he gets hurt. He was getting pushed around by a man half his size, should have been the other way. Poor performance and gun shy, let your hands go or go home
I like Anthony Joshua’s new moves you hold Your opponents head so it doesn’t move while you punch it
Terrible should have been able to ko this man but he couldn't fury or wilder would maul him easy work
Referee was lenient with Joshua. AJ hold the neck of his opponent a lot in close a close. Overall victory for him but I am not convinced by his boxing style, I'am a bit disappointed in fact. I thought he was too stiff, not using correctly his size even thought Franklin did his thing..
AJ has changed his style so many times he doesn't know who he is.. he looks like a amateur boxer. Bring back the mongrel AJ U still stiff..
Franklin was tough man, ate some nice shots.
Well, I think that it was easy to guess that AJ would have won this fight. And to be honest, watching this fight just reassures me that AJ doesn't have a chance against Usk or Fury!! He just doesn't have the boxing skills! This fight didn't prove anything for AJ, and I don't think any of us boxing fans were impressed tonight.
Getting a lot better, to tight, need to relax,such as if he would have been a quarter inch closer his jab would have more damage,a inch backwards,,he was reaching
More impressed with Franklin than AJ. AJ looked bad.
AJ is that type of guy deluded fans will always criticize all-time  even if AJ is winning and doing the right thing taking on all boxers compare to Greedy Belly Tyson Fraudy who ducks and deny fans undisputed bout and yet you call him better fighter than AJ.  You guys should get a life and leave AJ alone.
Unfortunately AJ lost his winning confidence. AJ in his prime was a beast but Unfortunately his mentality after those losses have made him vulnerable. A great fight and sportsman but will never be a legend in the sport.
Wilder smokes Anthony like a swisher
Thanks 😊 for sharing!
Aj is scared of fighting he is not the same fighter any more I don’t see aggressive ness  on fighting
Watching this from a mutual position you can see how biased the commentators are towards AJ
Robotics move by Joshua
He's getting acclimated to the derrick James style which is  back to the basics
Lol
AJ is a boxer that can’t fight. When he should be fighting, he’s boxing. That’s why he has losses.
People still watch this trash ? 😂 UFC BABY
Total mismatch
What fight are people watching,  this was a brilliant display from a heavier Joshua.  Looking dangerous with better stamina at that weight.
I'm one of those critics that are lining up. No leg work, very little combinations, no angles shown, just stood in front of his man, no improvements and I'll stop there.
Well I made it a whole minute into the highlights and that’ll do lol
AJ did his thing!
A guy said “AJ fights like a robot”  lol y’all remember, when they said “Errol fights like a robot” I think it’s funny that they saying it now about Anthony now that he’s with D James🤣 let’s see how he progresses
Man AJ is so stiff and plodding
AJ looked amazing. The accuracy of his punches increased a lot and his defense was top tier this fight.
This fight, AJ, that fight is not ok, u are out of boxing
AJ shouldn't box at 250+ pounds.. 240-245 would be perfect
Why people keep bringing up wilder saying he lost to tyson. Tyson has about 40-50 lbs on wilder. If you ask me he his his part for being so much lighter than fury
Joshua has skills in abundance, but looked stiff and lacking confidence tonight and I have no idea why. He didn't bob and weave and was easy to hit, but when on the attack looked dangerous and accurate. He needs a trainer that can bring out the beast in him because he has it big time, an attacking Joshua with great movement on the attack and defensively is difficult to beat. I like the fella, he let himself down with the BLM movement and lost a lot of supporters, but we're a great country that love our sports people regardless of colour, so the past is the last, so let's get behind Joshua because I think he's a genuinely nice and decent fella that was misguided back then. Slicker moves, more aggressive from start to finish and I don't think anyone can beat him. Well done big man, really happy for you and I hope this gives you the confidence you needed because he was a tricky opponent. Sugar Hill Jr would be perfect for you as a trainer, you've got tools, and he would unlock them ❤
AJ spends way too much time in the gym and not in the ring
Joshua will never hold a belt again, he loses to any top 8 fighter in the division he is done
AJ’s boxing likes he’s on VR  video game 😂😂😂
AJ Might just be hiding his game. careful, careful!!
i salute franklin i wasnt familiar with his game,
Anthony Bruno
Aj isn't confident of himself anymore. Anyone in the top division or a belt holder will smack him around.  Too slow 🙄🙄
AJ is finished im afraid.....that was defo not a big comeback display!! looked very sheepish against a much shorter guy yet again
Tyson fury would dog walk joshua all day!
Joshua just as tentative and robotic as ever.  Should be walking through these blokes like Foreman did.
Tyson Fury needs to close the deal with Uysk 🥊💯🇬🇧
Joshua to stiff and slow. He doesn’t throw enough punches and this will be his downfall against a Tyson Fury or another fighter with a more up beat boxing style.
All this showed is that A.J is nowhere near on fury’s level.. . He just couldn’t cope with the onslaught that Tyson would bring! 🙄
Joshua has always been a suspect champion
02:17 so clean
🗑️
joshua tampak seperti robot,gerakannya kaku, pukulannya kurang variatif
If those were the highlights must have been a yawnfest watching live. AJ stock dropped again.
Aj used to clinch like clinshko.
The most boring highlights ever
I didn't watch the whole fight but when AJ throws his right, he has success. I see people saying like he lost confidence or isn't sure of himself and I can see it. I've watched his recent fights back a while ago and I can see like, he doesn't throw much alot of the time. I'm not a boxing expert but I know u gotta throw to win. U can't just defend and feint the whole fight. Hopefully this gives him confidence
Franklin looked great, he was relaxed and didnt seem overwhelmed by the occasion. Would have liked to see him change levels a little bit more by going to the body but decent performance 👍🏾
Wilder would put AJ in the D.I.R.T
Dayum AJ is gun shy
AJ vs Wilder
T.Fury / Wilder will easily beat Joshua
AJ is your typical textbook boxer.
Joshua looked scared
AJ’s done…
Boring! This guy is over rared.
There won't be any championship belt fights for AJ as he is now just a jobber more fit for the WWF specially after his sore loser punk move of throwing Usyks belts out of the ring
Fury would wipe the floor with aj he is not the same as he used to be he won but he’s unsure and very boring to watch now I think he needs to make a change in trainer now if he wants to move forward with his career he needs a trainer that has trained multiple heavyweight champions not this guy who makes him fight like an amateur after years of boxing this should be natural to aj but he moves like a robot
Big joe Joyce would walk through a.j 🥊
Idk how he beat a klichko... must have been a fluke. Aj is ok but nothing to write home about.
I think joshua had a hand injury ,the jab was so so ,but were was the right ?anyway job done ,well done AJ
Ruiz cracked em USYK BROKE HIM!!!!
Not bad. I can see the transition with James. I won't give him an A, but I think he's headed in the right direction.
This looked like Ruiz II.
Joshua will never be the same after that ruiz knockout.  He is afraid of getting knocked out and embarassed. Sigh.
Congrats, AJ... though he is too slow in decision-making, creativity , and lack of agility. Lacks aggression and hardness that we would see with the likes of Holyfield, tyson, etc. I still feel AJ would be brutalised if he tried Fury or Wilder.
This is one of the best performances of AJ as a technical boxer... He fought as a bigger man... That's a great improvement... Only casuals will say there was no improvement... Imagine someone saying AJ was scared, How? Scared of who? ... It is well.
AJ should definitely join The KRONK Gym.
Franklin should fight like tyson if he wants to win
Thanks DAZN
Joshua will never be the same again. NEVER… it’s written all over his face. Andi Ruiz has taken his confidence away.. Anyone who applies just a little more pressure will win against AJ. The Joshua before Ruiz will work forward and end this fight in minutes. He is so fearful and truly can’t take a punch. He won’t win against any competent fighter with this mindset…. Talk less if Fury. Fury will humiliate him. Poor guy! Everyone has their time to reign.
Vi ganar a Franklin, eso es corrupción
I think Joshua could have got really beaten Franklin to a stoppage. He just wasn’t aggressive enough. That could just be me from the outside looking in. I just don’t see that confidence he had before Ruiz
AJ is finished! This is not fight. Jarmaine Franklin is not even in top 30. They were looking for victim and they got him. AJ skills can't match any top fighters. He's not even sure of himself.
Joshua is nowhere near Deonty or Fury, very overrated boxer
Chisora next for AJ after that performance. Nowhere near ready for Wilder or Fury.
Joshua is so stiff
Aj fights off his back foot his feet and lower legs are weak
Trust me Joe Joyce is way underrated.   Imagine with Joyce would have done to Franklin?   Joshua doesn't have it anymore tbh and him being ushered another huge payday feels disingenuous and cheap. Even though I totally understand why.
If Franklin actually had any power in his right hand he would have hurt AJ. The fact that AJ gets hit so much with the Right is the main reason he'll NEVER FIGHT Wilder
Honestly? With the experience he has, the opponents he have fought in the past, he shoukd be at a way higher level than that....  İ'm really unimpressed by the level of skills he displays. Sure he is an okay boxer, but you don't feel the mastery, you don't feel the confidence, the looseness that shoukd go with it. He is tense, hesitant.   Still, props to him for his victory, hope it will help him build his momentum back
Joshua is a proper robot. Dude's movement is so predictable. Did he even ouch Franky once to the body 😂
I think Joshua is past his prime. He was a early bloomer like Mike Tyson. I fell his time is up.
I think AJ should speak with Izzy about what it feels like to lose to an opponent more than once. It’s not that deep, it’s only a loss. You’re still a top fighter and you’re still one of the best so don’t act otherwise. Izzy’s demeanour was exemplary, different sport but still
AJ is a too lucky man of  men, there was no Iron Peeka Boo  Mike Tyson or $mokey Joe Frazier in his time. Both were relatively smaller built boxers like Franklin here.  After 3 losses, AJ is no longer a boxer like before, but against Tyson "fatbelly" fury, his both cautious hands maybe enough to send The Gypsy "excuses" King well towards his  retirement kingdom.
Usyk simply on another level from these guys😊
This fight was trash they both lax power they couldn't knock the other out I say AJ needs to hung it up
Back for what? Dude can't box. He should retire already
Franklin fought Joshua well…
I thought by the title "AJ is Back" there were going to be some spectacular footage of AJ kicking posterior. Not quite!!! To be frank, AJ should retire (in my opinion). He's gone so far backwards its unreal. 8 years ago he destroys Franklin. He looked poor against a very average fighter.
Such a boring fight.
He never fought wilder or fury smh
Boring. Boxing or wrestling?
AJ has never been the same since Ruiz loss
Wilder would have and still will KO AJ!! No head movement!! Wilder right hand is going to land!! Fury beat him up!!!
yeah wilder would mop the floor with this joshua easy
Joshua que se retire que le pusieron ese muerto para que lo noqueara y no lo hizo  🙆‍♂️😅
I thought AJ was a bit cautious, trying to avoid defeat and the end of his awesome career.  He won and that's all that matters. Watch him in his Next fight!
Wilder vs Aj next....let'z go!
i think lean, mean war machine era has ended
Joshua is a done fighter. The first fight with Ruiz finished his career. Soon or later he's going to get ko really bad. He's not the same fighter. He should retire
el peleador más malo gano porque ese no sirbe
seen more convincing fights watching punch and judy
AJ’s time has and gone. Even though he looked in better shape to get like he was from a guy I’ve never heard of tells u everything u need to know. Wilder would destroy him inside 5 rounds.  It’s a wrap. Joshua’s white trunks were crimson but with his own blood.
AJ was lackluster at best. Wilder or Fury will embarrass him. AJ needs to fight Joe Joyce or Wilder next and retire. IJS
This division in boxing is boring. The heavy weight division is a waste of time watching.
Franklin showed Me something tonight. Congrats AJ. I want to see more Franklin.  🇦🇬✊🏾🇵🇷
Joshua's had his day
Aj used is range very well.
A.J is done my friends. He won't be à champion boxing this way...is Time to retire.
Glad this fight was free. Respect to both men
AJ looks much better in this fight but he has no chance against the gipsy king and Deanty Wilder.. that’s the fact..
AJ had a great fight! He'd taken everything away from Franklin so he  couldn't do anything. Great jab, distance, movement. Franklin a fast fighter for the weight and AJ game plan was perfect for this fight. 👏 👏
Joshua needs a Angelo Dundee type trainer
AJ can't beat Usyk or Fury...no doubt about it! Your time passed.
Where is the old joshua that won on kockouts!!!!!
Poor
Joshua seemed like he didn’t wanna be there. Might need sometime off now
Glad I didn't pay to see this bore fest.
Boring
With size advantage, AJ should have done much better.
joshua is a black racist  hopefully he looses his next fight  in this obe he was already scared
To be honest this fight none the less was very boring not so much as active
He’s back 😂😂😂 he’s 🗑️ AJ so slow he’s so predictable 😂 Tyson fury wilder would smash him easily
And what about this fight  Made the connection with AJ being “back” This was terrible he went 12 rounds with a body builder from LA fitness nothing more  He would still be killed against wilder or fury
AJ got everything of a boxer but needs to throw in the KO punch a lot more  I feel that’s been his biggest loss in his career
Definitely signs that AJ is improving under the new Trainer
Back , back to square 1
I'm a huge aj fan  I think he's been a great champion  done alot  for boxing    but somethings gone really  wrong with him 😔
Not a bad fight, but looked like what it was--a mismatch.  AJ looking tentative, and at times was retreating straight back--big no-no.  Franklin was durable, but he can't fight backing up, which gave the impression that if AJ had put more effort into pressing forward, he might've had more success.
One of the most boring fights ever except for 30 seconds in round 10. Aj has never been the same since Ruiz knocked him out. I remember when Aj was exciting and nearly always gaurenteed a finish or at the very least an exciting fight now it's slow robotic and stiff looking.
AJ deserves more respect. 👏 he has been a great champion for uk 🇬🇧 for yrs. Fought regularly never hid with his belts. People need to go n watch his fights. He has a brilliant record. Every1 ages 😢
Too me , Franklin could've got the win... but seems he didn't want to end Joshua's career.😂
Decent fight thou. Congrats AJ. Now let Furry fight come to light. All we want is an undisputed fight in 2023.
El boxeo ya es un negocio ya se descarga más nunca le llamó la atención por estarlo agarrando con el guante
Noticed Joshua has another layer to his game now! Props to Derrick James.
More head and feet movement and more firing off of the jab rather than being so hesitant whether he should or he shouldn’t would put AJ right back in the mix of things. Soon as he gets hit he resets and forgets the 2 after the 1 punch 😂 could’ve easily put Franklin down a couple of times off of that jab straight combo
I don't think Joshua knows his size he needs the young Mike Tyson attitude don't wait destroy them ...
I was not impressed....lazy
I like how people are talking about how Joshua cant hang with Fury ...  Fury is ducking Usyk .  How he can duck a guy 3/4 his size and still talk about being the best heavy-weight  is beyond Me.
AJ needs one more fight before Tyson Fury
His back dash is like a fighting game.
AJ needs to up his game as fury would tune him up inside 3 rounds
Joshua just a regular HW.
ANDY RUIZ WOULD HAVE FD HIM UP!
Aj looked really stiff, man he doubts himself, i wanna see the old stone breaking aj.
It looked like AJ has been watching Lennox Lewis fight. Tenderise with the jab waiting for the right and left on the back of the head while hitting with right uppercut😅
This looks like AJ fighting with an understanding that he has to win and work on some aspects to his boxing craft. Some call it "scared", I call it trying to work on some things in this phase of his career when he desparately needed a win.
Im happy for AJ with this bounce back, but he stil far from Usyk, Wilder let alone Fury.........Naaah AJ still have a long road
Franklin guy has a chin
AJ is shame usky schooled him what is boxing and if he step in the ring with fury or wilder they will ko him inside 6 rounds he is trash
Boring 😢😢😢
AJ’s back -  With a bore fest fight.
I still want to see Joshua Wilder
He’s fat from being back.
This fight was seriously boring men were just too cautious and took zero risks. AJ basically came out here to hug Franklin
Joshua looked terrible. Fury is in a complete different league
This man had the nerve to call lennox lewis a clown 🤡 and say he had no respect for him... the worst thing is he 100% percent meant it.. everything lennox said was facts
This performance by AJ will give Tyson Fury more excuses to duck his way out of a future fight with him unless forced to.
Wilder, fury, joyce will end his career
😮still not sure about A J he's not got a killer instinct
Tyson would so easily win fighting either of these
It was a fair bout outing for both Fighters
Da zone will always be clutch for posting the fights so fast & posting real highlights not no 2 minutes
Fight Wilder next!
The highlights were boring enough. The full fight must of been mind numbing. Joshua cannot use his feet at all.
Joshua can never win big anymore. Cant even knock this guy out. He stands no chance with Fury, Usyk, wilder
If that performance was AJ showing us he's a top contender, he failed miserably. Fury/Wilder & even Joyce beat him easily
AJ ! work on the speed and defence.  Physically you have everything to be the new Mike Tyson.
Frankkin is a decent fighter 21-2 and lost only 2 fights by decision to former title holders in Dylan White and Joshua. Yall act as if Joshua fought a tomato can
AJ boxed with arms glued to body. Terrible jab. No head movement. Punches are ridged from shoulders . Stood square giving away his heigh and reach advantage. Other than that he was average He has no chance against wilder, Joyce possibly close fight with Fury as he’s getting slow and clumsy recently
Франклін молодець. Даа, Джошуа краще з Уалдером не зустрічалися,бо стільки скільки попав Франклін ,то Джошуа вже був би накаутований. Ентоні без потреби змінив тренера - це НІЧОГО доброго..
AJ looks very vulnerable to a overhand right
Boring
Joshua is changed he is not the super star when he beated Klitcko. He is just a regular fighter anymore. So sad
AJ is done
For those who said he was afaid, it's his firsr fight with a new trainer and a tough opponet. Let's be real here AJ landed some wicked shots. That dude is tough and has fast hands. AJ had to be careful in there
A.J.'s footwork was horrible.   He needs to work on his movements, or he will continue to get busted up!
Not convinced with joshua
Fair play to Franklin.  Glad to see AJ is back.
It’s 2 pints of blood 🩸 of the refs sleeves 😂
Great job AJ
Anthony Joshua is just too slow he need to be rugged/aggressive in the ring too slow for my liking I don't expect Joshua smiling with no one in the ring he I expected him to be a killer machine in the ring
Franklin is limber...
AJ has been humbled and he needs to gain his confidence back
This version of franklin wud have beat dillain convincinly tbh...did not watch the fight but was reading comments on social media,Joshua actually looked pretty gd as the fight went on...He looked composed in there and comfortable
You know the bunny rabbit when they mate 2gether got more fast pace action just saying. Bang bang, boom 💥
Joshua forgot how to fight?
With this game plan, he isn't gonna take down fury
Franklin respect,warrior 👏 Joshua sorry, but not enough...
AJ you do have feet
I like Joshua but his losses have mentally effected him, he’s not the same fighter and I don’t think he will see another heavyweight title! Should go back to basics with what he used to do by throwing bombs and knocking people out! Tried to make himself a skilled fighter which he’s not! He struggles to let he’s hands go these day as you saw Joshua vs usyk 2….can’t really take a punch either in my opinion
That was the worst I've seen AJ, people will say Ruiz 1 or Usyk 1 but early on in the first Ruiz fight he looked decent and against Usyk he was dealing with a generational talent who played possum with Chisora. Franklin is an absolute pudding Dubois, Joyce or Jared Anderson would destroy him let alone Fury or Usyk.
I did not see any improvements. Just an even more cautious AJ. I will give him some leeway as he has just come off 2 losses and wants to bank a win or two. But he needs to put together more punches like before. He has def lost his killer instinct and too scared of being hit.
This guys soul was taken by Ruiz he still in the shadow realm
AJ is great 🐐🔥
He shd take the pain to break the cane, he's a boxer. Micheal B Jordan seems more professional than this
Looks like Frank Bruno now.
Nice one AJ and a fantastic one from Franklin. Exactly what Is needed to be done for a fast handed HW. However, this may not be enough to fight a fast handed and fast footed HW like Fury. All the best!
From watching the highlights it looked like Joshua lost imo…
Watched from the start, and fell asleep towards the end. Says it all really.
I appreciate how fast after the fight you guys compiled the highlights. BIG respect
AJ has become weak i expected a knock out from AJ
He's lost it
Lawanya bocill😂
Franklin looks 6ft1 but wider
He didn’t fight that great a fight to be honest……
AJ is not back stop it he ain’t doing nothing whack performance
I want AJ to be successful and continue boxing. I think he is a great fighter but after his string of losses , he doesn't see the same. Doesn't seem to have the "killer" instinct to knock out his opponent. He fought a smart fight tonight but he looked very reserved. To Franklin's credit, he held his own pretty well....but I expected AJ with the extra weight, to knock him out.  He has fought better opponents in his prime. He's still young so I think he has plenty of opportunities to win fights. He just needs to bring that killer instinct back. Congrats to him on this fight.
Seems like AJ never used  1000% oh his all imagine he had the endurance of a 120lb pounder and fast explosive and insane agility
Joyce vs Joshua. Battle of the brits. Can hold it at Tottenham stadium lol
Aj needs to go back to the drawing board and learn punches in bunches double up that jab he tall n strong to let these guys get in on him
There is so much Anthony Joshua could be doing with his life, why does he insist on boxing? I don't mean this in a hateful way. It is not likely that AJ will ever be any better than he is.
Lol at the video title
what a joke
Boring! 😅
Aj is back are they having a laugh
AJ is the 4th best HW at best... No way he ever beats Wilder, Usyk or Fury.
He fought tonight? Wack
Salute AJ looking way better 💯💪👍
Joshua looks no different. Stiff, low work rate, flicking a jab with no intent.
AJ don’t like fighting on the inside on the out using his jab , I want to see wilder vs AJ and fury vs chisora eleventeen. If you have 70/30 and make the guy walk away who got the 30 % u don’t want the fight simple as I’m fed up with fury now he will fight u for nothing 7 days a week and on the Tuesday wants a billion quid the Peruvian flake Has gone to his head
Boring fight
Sorry to say .it’s time aj hung up the gloves..
I don't think AJ threw a single counter punch
He might fight like a robot but I don't think he's a natural fighter but a bigger athlete who took up boxing in his teens n probably works out which is worthy... and he's Taller, bigger, stronger n built better...
Aj dont have that thunder no more. After ruiz dealt to him he has gone down hill.
I don't like the way AJ fights.AJ is slow and not aggressive.
Joshua is an ok boxer but he lacks killer instinct.
Pressure was on to get the W. Job done. Keep it movin...
Andy Ruiz took this mans soul never been the same since.
AJ is so easy to touch. I bet Wilder would have him snoring in less than 20 seconds. And Fury would just toy with him and laugh in his face.
Is this germaine stiverne
Joshua fought someone that isn't even in the top 5 in the u.s and isn't even in the top 30 in the world and he couldn't even finish him. What a joke.
He should’ve went slim Joshua
Bad times for boxing now(
Ref letting Joshua hold behind the head and hit dude a lot without saying anything
People in the comments have to realize that AJ is trying to be the best, which means working on his game, developing and not taking unnecessary losses. He’s a skilled boxer. He isn’t just a brawler. People have to admit that they just wanna see him brawl more than they wanna see him box.  They’re masking their preference as criticism.  People are saying he’s unsure of himself when he landed twice as many punches as his opponent while throwing 100 less punches.   People keep referring back to an old AJ in the legendary Whyte & Vlad  fights, but never seen to remember him getting hit with massive shots that almost swung the fight the other way (got reckless and wobbled against Whyte and got knocked down and gassed against Vlad).  Again, frame your preference as preference; not criticism.
AJ holding head other guys head. thought AJ was cool back then  but seems more like a punk, man..
Big up to Jermaine👍
Joshua why don't you go into golf..
What is all the pink stuff over the refs shirt and AJ?
Aj could never defeat Usyk 😄😅
For a come back joshua should have made statement.. next time should be more aggressive and let go of hands more apart from that it was decent fight respect to both fighters
I think AJ should retire and enjoy his life because its no longer there. The fighting spirit is longer there. This should have been a routine fight for AJ. You can see that he's timid and really scared to brawl. No chance for the HW title.
AJ too scared to engage fully. All the criticism hurt his confidence
Joshua can't beat the top heavyweights anymore . he's way to easy to counter, when throwing anything but a jab. No fluidity, he's flatfooted. He fights like a rock em sock em robot. Fury would embarrass him and Wilder would ko him.
joshua is trash now  ..  decision against this guy smh  ... once the mind goes, it's over
AJ held Franklyn's head and gave him not one but three upper cuts ..Ref says nothing. Only thing worse about British Boxing with it's uncalled/non-penalized rabbit punching and its desperate haymakers ...is British refereeing. Joshua is stiff.
I think we’re being a bit too critical of AJ here. He boxed well considering this guy was pretty much a Ruiz doppelgänger
'Pillow fist' fury is stopping his opponents while heavy hitter AJ is winning by decisions. How things have changed
Fury destroys aj IMO
AJ didn't look mean, hungry nor confident, for me ,  he is still a level down from MR U and even Fury.  not a convincing win..
Must  protect glass jaw , hence punch and grab style.
AJ's advisors are terrible - keeps getting with trainers that have never trained heavyweights - also derrick james style too static to beat fury - AJ nearly holded as much as okolie
I expected A.J to give him a knock out
Hard to comprehend why Joshua is calling out Fury, after that performance.
Aj picked his shots well tonight! Fair play Has he got what it takes for fury.. I don’t think so, But it’s boxing anything can happen
I miss the way Joshua used to fight
Any top fighter would’ve picked Joshua apart tonight he’s done man will never get a belt back
Decent win onto the next..Please fight Hrgovic next..
Overrated
don’t know who told AJ that you can be a nice boxer.  no aggression or whatsoever, just a nice guy... i honestly don’t like watching him anymore. he kills the game with nicey attitude. he should just retire and become an actor honestly.
im 18 stone im heavy
Joshua’s confidence is shot and he will never win another belt. he should fight a domestic fight against Dillian Whyte then maybe go for Joe Joyce.
Idk why AJ comes in the ring so big. He’s much better when he’s lighter. He moves like a robot with outdated software
You can say what you want about Aj but he’s still one of the best boxers today.
Franklin can fight .
He's like a robot can't move faster because of he's body language
Joshua needs to loosen up, he could do with some dancing lessons. His way to stiff and doesn’t have the conviction of a fighter
Aj holds the back of the head a lot. Referee didn't even pull it away let one give him a warning.
Robbery,, Joshua lost the fight.
Joshua appears a bit washed.
Joshua no tiene con que ganarle ni a Fury ni a Wilder ni a Usyk, así de simple.
Derrick James doesn't look too pleased.
Aj looked fine, got winded at the end
Joshua not the same fighter we once knew, but a win is a win. Wilder still number 2 best heavy weight
Look like a sparring match, everybody seems down on him but if you follow Errol or Jermell Charlo, you can see some of the things he been working on. I'll give him two more fights and Derrick will have him ready!
I would like to see aj fight klit in this stage of his life he would get destroyed, and I like aj:(
Glad the fight was for free. Yoooo why did it look like AJ had blood on his shirt before he came to the ring???
AJ a big robot chicken hidden behind a jab and 4 steps bk my opinion tap tap hide
Let's go to WORK!
It's seems he's lost confidence when fighting . He shouldn't fight fury . It's not his trainers fault he seem to have lost the fire inside him
AJ is so overrated. Dude hurts his opponent & just sits back and waits, let’s them get their legs back under them…maybe I’m wrong but his combos seem non existent.
Joshua looks finished
The worst boxing game ever!😂😂😂
Franklin is a dog
AJ had safety fist in this fight -- he could've stopped Franklyn in 10th if he stepped on gas
Joshua needs to establish the jab more ! With more jabs he can drop the straight right down the pipe and knock more fighters out. But if he sits there with no jabs he'll get dropped
I'm afraid to say it but AJ is finished, lack of aggression to slow with footwork and movement, no killer instincts. Wilder, Joyce, Fury all will dismantle and destroy him!
he fought a small opponent
He looks afraid to fight he's movement is very slow that's why Osyk will always win against him and dominate the fight I hope AJ will improve his movement to became faster and has beautiful head movement just like Manny Paquiao
Aj a sore loser
AJ should just go head an be a model. Shouldn’t even be this close with his gifts.
Cheers for the quick highlights DAZN
This is sad.
AJ vs Wilder is still a great fight.
Well done AJ 😊
Didn't see anything from Joshua that shows he is ready to fight the best heavy weights.Fury,Usyk,Wilder would all easily beat this version of Joshua .
Joshua looks like he isn't even interested anymore. Dude gets his hand raised with zero emotion.
Joshua is the Ben Simmons of boxing
Imagine wilder lands that at 2:40. It’s over.
Whenever I see Joshua fight I always think there's no way on earth he spars like how he fights live🤦🏾‍♂️
AJ harus ganti pelatih 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
AJ is not ready for anyone in the top 10!
The fans are awesome.
i respect AJ but he has zero power or urgency. Wilder KOs him easily under 5 rounds. Fury does whatever he wants to him easily.
He better be glad he never booked Tyson Fury.  The Gypsy King would have mopped the floor with him.
Heavyweight boxing is trash 😒🥱😜
Nah! he ain't back.
Anthony Joshua needs to fight Wilder. I don’t care what anyone says. Both of them have lost their belts, so this should make for a very interesting fight. I hope the fight btw Wilder and Ruiz happens. Both Joshua and Wilder needs their momentum to help set up a fight between them. I’m just surprised neither of them is calling each other out!
Aj artık kemerleri geri alsın. Biz de rahat uyuyalım.
AJ is going into the guy’s office to fight and he has NO BUSINESS DOING SO. Nothing should go in there but HANDS. Fight from outside; he has the reach.
I would be interested to see the hitting statistics.  I think they must be very close. The fight was close.  Those judges scorecards are ridiculous and this from an Englishman . Very dissapointed in AJ. Seriously, I think he should retire.
Joshua looks like he takes big p00ps
Great fight and win but I see no changes at all. I am not a boxer but I watch it alot and he has the same game movement in all his 3 loses. If he pays me just for tha advise he would be unbeatable😂
Franklin has some speedy hands though.
This the best I've seen Joshua fight
Hate to see this, josh is done 😞 genuinely hurts but it is what it is.
YAWN
Im thinking ksi would have had this over in 3 rounds. Aj doesnt have that ko power
i liked Joshua , he lost one thing though, the beast mode , the savage punches!
AJ is fake champ
Aj needs to hang up the gloves. That was said.
Highlights were tedious. Glad I never bothered watching it live...
should have been an easy knock out or at the least knock down for joshua . not very impressive , i reckon, and hope, wilder smokes him. thats if joshua has the balls to get in the ring with wilder
Hardly a definitive statement. Looked like an amateur sparring match round the local gym.
17st and boxes like a fairy 🤦‍♂️ He should rush his opponents and throw vicious bombs but he's scared to get hit. Really poor.
"You guys say that is the fighter that's supposed to contend with Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury. Stop. Just stop.".
Antony Josua,,no is the best,,
Andy Ruiz changed Joshua's whole style lol
AJ looked HORRIBLE! Now he wants money for FURY? Make him fight Wilder! And he will never fight again! Hes back? Get off the juice also
AJ can't win on knockouts he only wins on points
Can you imagine AJ with the Philly Roll and the platform he boxes from!!!??? Sheesh get you another team!!! Ijs 💫
AJ the bodybuilder 😂,  needs to learn how to dance and get some rhythm.
Another easy to watch free stream haha.
Aj jab was amazing he just had to not be so stiff.
He looks better aj
Welcome back. Still won't beat usyk and fury tho
Fury and Wilder stop AJ.
Aj looks like not same again, lokk like trauma fighter 😢
Aj still a fraud
Terrible ref. Shouldn't have let aj hold every 3 seconds. AJ has no chance against fury or Wilder.
Boxing looks more like wrestling these days
Best coach ever for Joshau
For anyone who's gonna criticize AJ for his approach.. I really love it.. knowing he's just coming back from 2 defeats in a roll, another defeat here will signal a retirement... Better sticking there and getting they win
Aj is my guy but he’s not beating Wilder. Don’t @ me
Joshua just isn't doing for me anymore he must stay away from Joe Joyce... rather go by wilder
Be like water tony …you fight like robocop bro
He’s not going to go far moving like that man
AJ HAS TO REMIND PEOPLE HOW BIG HE IS. HE HAS TO BOX AT TIMES AGRESSIVE BUT SMART. He’s to defensive now.
See how jake paul killed boxing
AJ …. Maybe few fights… that’s it .
Another Bruno
AJ is turning into Klitschko/Mayweather. Defence first. Going down the low risk option makes sense but it is boring to watch. Klitschko would have KO'ed Franklin. I feel sorry to those people who paid to watch the full version of this.
You can tell Anthony isn’t satisfied
AJ’s cack. And a massive baby to boot. Just retire, no one cares anymore for yesterdays man.
Ajs lost his bottle!!! Alll his fights before he would go for it and tire within 5 rounds this fight looks like he is too worried about his defence to be anthony Joshua!!! Going the same way as haye
Seems like I’m seeing a lot of excuses on why he can’t let his hands go. It’s clear to me for most fighters. Once they get knocked out or hurt really bad once it makes them more hesitant to let their hands go. Very special few it doesn’t affect like bhop, Pac-Man Devin etc
People keep asking where the "old, more aggressive version" of AJ is, forgetting that style is exactly what caused him to get stopped by Ruiz years ago
BORING 😮
Boring as fark…
Gadamn Joshua you muscular idiot punch !!!!!
AJ should retire, no skills to be a champion, terrible movement, no tactics and no heart at all.
AJ went in and did the job. He didn't need a KO, he needed a win and got it.
I'm seeing improvements from AJ. The Q is can he beat Wilder or Fury, in my opinion probably not.
AJ hasn’t still improved in fluidity and leg work
say what ....... AJ back?? AJ has to be the most boring heavyweight fighter out there at the moment...... why you fighting so shook for big guy?. sorry but a real hitter will knock AJ tf out.
I don’t know to many who would’ve beaten Joshua tonight.
I don’t see AJ winning any world titles again
AJ looking stiff with no power
Give 'em time. He'll be back. Under a new coach and working on what's taught new tonight. Importance was getting the win unanimously. Staying focused on basics before resulting back to old ways. Give 'em time. Congrats to AJ.
This was never gonna be a walk in the park for AJ , he is way too stiff in the ring, his body language screams out fear of being hit because he knows he can't take a decent shot on the chin, he needs a trainer that's gonna show him how to loosen up and stop being so robotic. He got way too complacent after beating Charles Martin and thought he was untouchable and invincible. He's lost his hunger and needs to dig deeper find it again. He has all the attributes in there to have been a great boxer, but  somethings holding him back from being that. It's called fear and its written all over his face.
Don't really know what the moaning is about. 🤷 AJ is looking like a better boxer. Lead left is looking crisper. Every jab is sharp, spiteful. Left hook is a new punch in his arsenal. Counter-punching is much more disciplined. He is no longer over committing with every success (leaving himself open to being countered). I can genuinely see a new stretch of winning ways, on the order of Vladimir Klitschko after Brewster, in his future at this rate.
Joshua is a standing target
who tf is jermaine
Unutilised pyhsical advantage, Wilders can knock him out...!!!
Another fraudley harrison
I wanna see joshua verse wilder
AJ was difficult to watch.
AJ is really a transformed boxer
Well, I think this proves it's game over for joshua
Aj washed
Anthony Joshua fights are so boring
AJ is done.
The most surprising thing out of this fight was the Ref’s white shirt and Joshua’s white trunks turning pink/red-ish at the end of 12RDs 😂😂
AJ lost that final match in Olympics. Yes I said it...zero boxing skills(hit , don't get hit)
Joshua was so wise to stay away from Deontay.....he can't last three rounds with the bonze bomber
It's over.  No confidence, no agression, no desire. Things you need as a top level fighter.
AJ is just way too flat footed, no footwork, soo much power but doesnt know how to use it. Big for nothing sorry to say
Rewatched the Klitschko fight and its so sad the difference. Andy made him too overly defensive
Coach D.Jams & Aj👍👍🏆🏆🦾🦾🏆🙌🙌🦾🦾👍👍🦾🦾
Joshua  isn't much better..he will be outclassed by a B fighter ..An A fighter will stop him
Joshua man needs to put his money into n somet else couldn't Evan beat a journeyman
Everything worked according to plan for AJ.. He was not going for a knockout
will not bet on AJ scared AJ
AJ is slowly building his confidence back, he needs opponents like this and harder.
The most one sided broadcast I’ve seen. Terrible.
It was a pretty basic performance. A little static at times. Started almost every attack with a jab, which is fine, but the odd lead right hand would have caused mayhem and I don't think he threw it once. Looked like a fighter who was being careful not to lose. Not aggressive enough. Could have won in 4 rounds. Never really committed to being destructive. Having said that, won on points convincingly and did a professional job. After 2 losses in a row, he should be fairly happy with that. I think he needs another fight at a similar level to improve his confidence. The killer instinct needs to come back. There's a balance to respecting your opponent and a lot this seems like an over correction
So much haters why? Congratulations to AJ
Anthony Joshua days are over Tyson furry will destroy him if they ever did fight that will be sad to see
Ladies and gentlemen I give you Roboboxer 😂😂😂
0 respect for Joshua after he threw those belts over the ropes
JA is stiff - added weight
Joshua is back?   Stop wasting my time with this baloney.
Franklin is better, he's smart and agile, Joshua doesn't look agile when he move head body in defend even though he punches hard
Commentary be bias af & I’m British 🤣
Sad fight......he needs to stop boxing ....he don't have the heart for it.
Fury or Wilder will destroy AJ 😂
Joshua's improved footwork? Hahahaha
AJ Needs To Be Smaked Around  American Style U.K. Fighters Have a Natural Haye For Us Be In the End We The Protype• innovators For their Comeback career. an Have That old Fear Be Ripped out of Him 2 Show His Old Fire!! instead He Bleeds 💰 Like every other who decide to Fall an Be commanded by the Darkside Rules..
You hear cheering but look at the crowd faces, is anyone cheering or shouting
Never been the same since Ruiz whooped him  Bigger guy that can't enforce himself on the opponent no aggression
after AJ got flung into the ropes i instantly knew he was gonna start being more aggressive😂
All you keep talking about Andy Ruiz defeat. Andy just through a lucky shot that stopped aj and aj came back and punished him for recovery letting it be known that Andy can’t beat him. He not fighting scared , he is fighting smarter. It’s a difference. He will be champion again. He has plenty time to adjust and get the belts back. He had weak trainers , now he got a trainer that going to show him how to use his size and power. Just keep watching . Andy will never be champion again. There is real champions and there is lucky ones that get the recognition once in a life time . Aj will stop Andy right now today . Facts!
_Come on AJ we need more of this from you_ 11:54  _AJ needs to wear a 180 pound body  vest to improve his body speed and he needs to bring back more of his voracious combos_
Joshua’s best years are behind him.
That was a pretty decent opponent after coming back from two losses, it was competitive but AJ was never in real danger meaning he got to work on some stuff. You can see he is thinking too much in there though
Seen more action in a don frye v takayama
Still a stiff, with a glass chin.
Not one single body shot from Joshua went head hunting all through.
AJ is back from where?  He fights like he is being trained off the book "Boxing 1-2-3 for dummies".   He can't beat Fury or Wilder.  He should retire.  They are just making money off him at the expense of his health.  Who is this tomato can he was fighting?
Nothing about that performance told us that a j is back!!   If anything it told us that dillian whyte isn’t as washed and ready for retirement as the fans first thought! Facts!
This was a sad fight.  AJ couldn't even throw a combination to score a Knockdown on this overweight boxer that was out of gas by round 5, had no reflexes at all and even STOPPED TO THINK  for a moment what punch to throw?? Wilder or Fury would have KOd this gentleman before round 7.  Joshua even got a bloody nose by this man and struggled in the last round??  Man, Joshua is done; it's so sad.  Fury may fight him to help him rescue his career, but otherwise AJ is not champion material anymore
Joshua’s height an reach is killer. Makes it easy to throw uppercuts on a shorter person
Boring
Anyone here get fooled by wwf
Aj is a clown 🤡
this was horrible joshua was  tired and franklin was exhausted..these guys hugged each other for half the fight..trash fight joshua needs more cardio
AJ is done.
The new Joshua can’t beat wilder with fighting like this
Joshua makes Wlad look like Ali by comparison
Zzzzzz
Big dub for AJ🙏🏽
Most biased commentary I've ever heard.
Gypsy king would walk through these two.
AJ isn’t back. I see nothing from the usyk fight that is different about him. He should get it over with and fight Wilder.
2:43  Josh held him up from going down
Boxing by numbers. Yawn.
Idk that Joshua won that fight....
Joshua is like a slow stiff robot that hasn't been oiled for years... Boxing is not his natural sport
5:39 That's was vintage Joshua right there! And you gotta admire Franklin's chin. That shd've sent him packing.✨🥊💯
2 and 3 round to franklin
AJ lost his confidence and look scared...
_Yeah, it was at this moment we thought we had AJ back_ 8:52
He didn’t look to happy getting that win.
How can he be so in shape and his jab has no pop. Joshua should have been able to win this on just jabs
A “Rock Em Sock Em” J 🤖 Wilder and Fury will SLEEP him 💤 😴
Ngl AJ is lucky to be a big lad! Because that boy cant box, so stiff and robotic. Never had it tbh.
Great fight. Franklin is a beast.
AJ  is back?? yeah back in the ring thats all,,Joshua is a spent force now,scared to use powerfull combinations,you can see the fear to commit himself.Ruiz took something from him he cant get back..
Franklin needs a rematch
Cement blocks on his feet
Is it legal in clinch to hold your opponents head with left hand for example, and punch with right?  Opponent doesnt have a chance even to try a dodge. Interesting....
All those who predicted a knockout from the 3rd to the 8th round really don't have a clue.. Joshua struggled badly and those belts are in very safe hands. I guess a fight with Wilder is off the cards now but Whyte is likely in six months or more...🙄
_Is there AJ’s blood on his shorts?_
He needs more work throw the jab more counter he needs to go to the body he stands straight up defense was ok a lot better than before
Anthony Joshua fights like Muhammad Ali when he had parkinson's
He should have finished him with those two body shots come on AJ... You got the goods
He's not a fighter he's not a boxer he's a body builder with boxing gloves. Also the UK announcers are the worst biased garbage (don't @ me)
All i see is a guy way bigger than the other
Franklin so clean and quick but Joshua looked conditioned
Wilder, Fury, Uysk knock Franklin out cold, just saying.
Aj still needs to stay far away from wilder and the rest of the top guys. Not sure if he is ready yet
Joshua need to go to Lennox Lewis and copy his style ...he would dominate the decision if he did that......does Joshua ever get mad?
😂
Jesus loves you-!!
Joshua looks like he just completed the tutorial and jumped right into matchmaking.
Yeah sorry but Derrick James didn’t really do much for Aj
people arent giving jermaine franklin the credit he deserves, before dillian whyte he had 2 weeks training including sparring tyson fury  because he works full time in a factory. since that fight franklin has trained consistently for 4 months until anthony joshua. franklin is the next big star, with the money hes earned and pro athelete fitness training he will quickly be unstoppable. legend!
He’s not really back. Considering this guy is a relative nobody. He just went 12. Hard rounds with Joshua. Probably should’ve taken him out. He still fights a little bit too robotic. He’s not loose enough. This didn’t show me much. He’ll always be a fighter. But, I think his prime is behind him. Maybe he’ll prove us wrong.
Aj will never hold a belt again
Franklin the holding master 🤣 holding the hole fight, no wonder he got beat by whyte 🤣🤣🤣
After Andy ruiz rocked him! His never been the same
Have no chance to beat Fuly.
Love you aj what a show . Well done
SLOW LIKE ENGLAND BOY
Glad I didn't pay to watch this trash fight
AJ sustained a bloody nose early in fight was bleeding all over couldn’t put Franklin away the much smaller guy I’d say AJ looked very slow very predictable very robotic as usual with no fight real aggressiveness in him Why a man of his size isn’t walking guys down and just cutting them in half is beyond me I guess he wants to be a boxer lol if it was me I’d walk these guys down go for the KO and get out of there Ruiz ruined AJ’s career at the Garden AJ is so scared to mix it up it very obvious AJ boxes with extream caution it’s boring to watch
Not better than ever but older.
Es fácil hablar de un boxeador si haberlo sido... Reciba un puño y luego hable...
I used to think A.J. would wash Wilder…not sure what happened to A.J. but Wilder will stop him in brutal fashion.
All these bias Americans calling AJ a unprofessional fighter all cuz he tapped him after the bell lol he did that cuz franklin held every round 🤣 would of got knocked out if he didn't hold everytime aj had him rocked
Wilder kills AJ easily
That was a shut out and he still getting criterium. Excellent perfume  by Aj .
Joshua is the new Frank Bruno.
Highlights and I still had to fast forward to keep interested. Joshua is so robotic, relies on size not skill.
Aj has improved
People wanted to see a more aggressively hungry savage aj . Seems the savage brutal aj that knocked out Klitschko  is no longer there.
All you spectators speaking on fighters being cautious about taking shots, have you ever considered that they've taken irreversible damage while being contractually required to fight?
Aj that was so bad
That was a solid fight and AJ is gonna get better he did well against a solid opponent
Trash
Anthony should have played football 🤔
Wilder or fury ko these two
aj beat a taxi driver.
That was... interesting. He's becoming a boxing robot. Technically his boxing is better sure, but he is becoming a much worse fighter.
AJ is back, why? He got a win against a guy who is not really on anyone's radar and who he has every possible advantage over. Joshua looks petrified when he an opponent lands a few decent shots and he can say what he likes but the battering by Andy Ruiz has mentally scarred him. And Bellew must've been watching a different fight based on his scorecard. The rest of the division won't be worry about AJ if they watched this, not like you get to see the fights you want, thanks to the networks, the fighters and the sanctioning bodies all having different agendas. And jokers like Tyson Fugazi with his childish antics of leaving his would-be opponents little choice but to back out don't help. Overall this was the expected result but a title fight is way off.
Wow that other guy is way smaller
maybe if he stop trying to be a bodybuilder and leave the weights alone and force himself more he could be better but im saying, the shots he's landing should of knocked his opponent out
Nothing here to worry Fury, I expected to see a hungrier AJ, and he only really turned it on in the final rounds.
Aj looked Heavy and abit not sharp in this fight, he needs to loose weight to be abit sharper
Franklin looks like if shaq oneal and deontay wilder had a baby
aj is no more top level   looks like amateur
WOW ,Joshua beat an uber driver by Decision!!!!!!!
AJ could use some more speed.
Aj is cooked imo 🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️😂😂
Congratulations Aj
Glad I didn't watch this fight even the highlights are boring half way threw and iv had enough
Gone from a destroyer to a cautious fighter trying to use his boxing skills.  Fury and Usyk possess superior boxing skills so unless he unleashes the dog in him and neutralises their boxing ability, he’ll likely get outboxed.  He needs a world class sports psychologist to rewire his boxing mind not different trainers as he has the power and capability just is unable to harness it due to what looks like a mental block telling him to be more cautious.
Looks a man without any dog in him. Has the fire gone out 🤔
Несмотря на критику Энтони, у него есть позитивные изменения: - в ближнем бою не как раньше не ввязывается в размен и не паникует. Уже грамотно сковывает и накладывает сопернику на голову руки; - намного лучше бьёт прямой правый; - джебом тоже улучшил работу.  - апперкоты в клинчах это хороший вариант.
Looks like AJ needs to Hang ‘em up 🥊
I think the problem with aj is that he is too fans conscious , either he believes or thinks that he has to be perfect for fans , he wants to give satisfaction to fans and wants them to see him as the perfect gentle face of boxing , this has made him lose the killer instinct of a fighter. He always wants to deliver a classical scientific victory 😅. Reason why usyk won the first fight . Reason why fighters like fury,wilder and Mike Tyson are dangerous. Fury was even licking wilder blood in their first bout. Wilder doesn't care if he finishes a fight within 10 seconds but come to aj he will want to drag ,fight classy till his opponents wear but ironically they get more confident and fight him back.
Aj v fury now
Very stiff I think his days are done in boxing his last defeats are to much for him I think
he fight with nobody not even top 10 rank in any major belt organization.
This was his sparring guy
He is doing this for money and Eddie going to treat him like Tommy Morison before he told the world he had aids he can make big money winning.
Fun fact I fell asleep during this fight....I wasn't tired 😂😂
I don't like the future for AJ. He is still afraid of being hit and therefore doesn't commit - always been that way. Franklin fought a great fight, but did not fight as a small man until the last 3 rounds. He countered AJ on many occasions, but did not come from underneath enough. I look forward to seeing the entire fight.
Not a fan of this big man but I've been waiting for his return to see how he bounces back from the loss. We will see forward how he recovers after all thats happened thats gonna tell us what this mans really about.
Was the boxing short of Franklin legal? Looks very high and with fillings????
Sorry AJ, I think it’s time to retire since your first loss  The fire has gone out I think it’s time to walk away
Joshua a stepping stone now he can’t handle fury or usyk  maybe wilder since wilder is just like him…look how he couldn’t put Franklin away
I like Joshua as a man, he’s a nice guy, but I’ve never rated him, I’d heard of him & watched him for the 1st time against a over the hill Klitscsho & wasn’t impressed. I think Wilder will KO him in 4 rounds, if that fight ever happens 🥊
AJ trying to be more technical isn’t a issue to me as he looked solid with the jab and counters but coming in the heaviest he’s been in his career I think made the fight more difficult for him than it had to be. He could’ve won this 12-0 if he came in lighter
Pre Andy Ruiz Aj would have knocked this dude out in 3. Andy put the dog on a leash. He's affraid to mix it up and get hit. I didn't see the AJ of before. I saw a timid fighter that was worried about getting knocked out
AJ played it smart in this boxing match.
Keep It Up! Im One Of The Pioneers Of Rappers That Sing, Produce, Mix And Master All Of Their Own Music. If You Want Come Along For The Ride! - Bryan
since the ruiz loss joshuas been scared stiff, doubts and worries in his mind have stiffened him up to the point of not being able to fight to his full potential anymore......hes not strong enough mentally to do anything about it now imo....he should be finishing the likes of franklin if he wants the top 3!, theirs no chance for him up there!
Franklin isn’t a bad fighter he just needed to be more active. But congratulations to AJ clear and easy win for him.
They finally got him a win AH?
AJ needs to fight every single round like the 12.
Aj did great tonight... aggressive..usin the jab ,,body work
😴 🛌
Joshua’s done. He won’t be world champion again
Aj got Bob hope against wilder or fury
Sorry but Joshua is not a natural boxer. He struggles. Hard to watch . He's bigger ,longer reach looks much stronger. Impose your will ,attack. If he'd keep pumping the jab Joshua wouldn't have a busted nose. He's giving his opponent way too much time to get set and throw something. And he is not quick enough to throw the lead right so don't .Set it up with the jab. He needs to be more relaxed and fluid. He's real stiff. Doesn't seem confident. If I can see it his opponent surely can. INTIMADATE! You'r a big dude USE IT!
Spence vs Joshua next!
Idk man, didn’t really see any flashes of greatness here. AJ has a look on his face of confusion at times and other times boredom esp when they tie up. It prob ain’t fun to receive those but that jab looks slow and laboured. Wanna see AJ back on top but this performance doesn’t convince me he’s ready for top opposition again.
Watching AJ is so boring. Big man with heavy hands, moves as slowly as a turtle.
AJ's looking soft and didn't put much energy, but I'm glad he won... Congrats my Naija brother.. we love you man
if wilder hits that chin of AJ half as much as franklin???
AJ is not a like before Andy Ruiz losses
Mediocrity at its best.  Guy lacks balls and a chin.
This joshua now have no chance against joyce, fury or wilder he is finish .
I just wanna see aj vs fury
AJ actually looked comfortable/in control and quite fluid in terms of his movement. I think people need to give Franklin credit, he’s actually a solid fighter, very quick and feisty once he gets his rhythm going.
This was a tune up fight and he could not take him out
Joshua trash
Nope. I'm not buying into AJ's return against a pretty poor opponent. He couldn't finish the guy either.
He did say the motivation is money now so 🤷🏽‍♂️
Well that was a boring fight
decent domestic level fight
I think AJ did a great job he slowed the pace down take his time pick his shots see the openings he will get better if ihe keep working with Derrick James.
A.J. please we need A.J more improvement from you please
Not gonna get a win in his hometown that’s clear to see smh great job to Franklin 💯 AJ constantly held the back of his head while throwing punches
Aj fights like a Tekken character! I want to see him do really great but he’s not outboxing or out banging fury or u
“Highlights”
This is really concerning ngl. Fight Takam once more and then pack it in.
AJ exposed himself too much in round 5 n 6,
From what I see, he is not ready yet for fury or usyk. Still a lil too stiff and lack fluidity. Easy target!  The loss to ruiz just too great.. mentally block. Not the AJ of old.. Where he used to show lots of courage and confident in his skill.
I don't even know why Anthony Joshua is still boxing. Enjoy your money man you'r straight garbage you can even beat this tomato can .
*I believe AJ should retire* *It’s not there anymore*
Franklin great fight, Anthony same ole stiff, boring and flat show.
Never been an AJ fan and this is why. Imagine being a boxer now for years and you fight at this skill level... The guy has money, the guy can get so many amazing trainers to train him well, he has every tool to be one of the most amazing heavyweights of all time and yet he falls short because of bad decisions he has made over the years. It's such a shame as well being from the UK myself and not backing your own. But just the truth. No way he would beat wilder or fury with this present skill.
AJ fights Fury, it won't last 3 Rounds. AJ at best is a sparring partner
Ruiz jr. took AJs heart
AJ needs to fight Fury.The winner gets Usyk.
Poor fight,pantomime season is coming
AJ is slow and he knows it. I’m sure he gets hit a lot in sparring
why is he so stiff lol
He's being really cautious and fighting mad stiff hes hesitating.
AJ is not the AJ that fought Klitscko he doesn't have that look in his eyes, he didn't use the jab enough his defense has always been suspect but the offense was there now bc he doesn't output the lazy defense shows
he still ddnt work on his movement.. 0 agility... its sad
Alot of holding
Anthony Joshua fought and no one cared
Wow, what a boring fight of jabs and hugs
AJ will embarrass himself against Fury
Why fight jermaine instead rematch with person who beat jermaine 😂😂😂 boxing is sad now
Fury literally will eat AJ for days if they fought 😂😂😂
If this was a guy coming up from 130 to 145 people would say it is unfair due to size.  But for some reason at HW, this obvious size difference does not matter?  IMO these two should not be in the same weight division.
AJ just needs to loosen up.. clear his mind! A W is a W but this type of performance wouldn’t work against  Tyson Pitty Pat Fury 🥊
AJ im sorry but if you square up to tyson he's going to end your career. Mediocre fight for a Mediocre boxer
Joshua boxed wonderfully, like the second Ruiz fight. From Tyson Fury, Lennox Lewis to now AJ. A British fighter trained by an American trainer (with the American style of boxing) equals.....savagery.
Joshua showed nothing in this fight enough said
Anthony Joshua is a living breathing example of size does not matter
AJ so weak now, never the same as before.
Franklin is actually a difficult opponent to contend with, he effectively cuts you off the ring and brawls with you. Congratulations to AJ.
Hes back?  What's the other guy ranked?
If you want to go to sleep.  Watch an Anthony Joshua fight
This man couldn't beat a dead horse
Feed Joshua to surging prospect like Sanchez, or the big Russian Makhmudov, or Gassiev.  If they win they can build a name off of him.  I have no desire to see fury or wilder waste a fight again him
😂👍😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👍👍👍👍 what a joker
A s đánh nhây quá
13 minutes are not a highlights
I’m only a minute in but the commentary is so bad already 😂
Boring boring boring
LOL
I think Aj should fight    In the next 15 months   1.joe joyce  2.Frank Sánchez 3. Efe Ajagba 4. Wilder
That was a boring match. 😂
Joshua is better when be fights
yall none boxing fans cant see that AJ is learning to calmly box thats what he needs so he can set up the KO
Uninspiring win by Stiff Joshua
Rewatching this fight highlights, it shows clearly that Joshua is much stronger than Franklin but for some reasons he chooses to be more of a technical fighter rather than an explosive one.
Franklin had a lot of desire to win, but he is not strong enough to hurt Joshua... In our days, at his high & power he cannot be champion!..
AJ move your 🦶
Ngl im surprised/disappointed AJ didn’t get the ko
The king is back!
Why dosent he seem happy with the W🤔🤔🤔
Didn't even know AJ had a fight
What highlights?
Wilder would destroy Joshua. His callout at the end of Fury and Wilder was feeble. Since the first Ruiz fight when he got knocked out, he's looked a shell of himself. Robotic, slow, the combinations are not free flowing and he seems too afraid to take a punch in order to land.
I think AJ is too big for Franklin, who showed massive heart, strength and endurance. AJ looked very strategic, like he's learned some skills from fighting Usyk. Credit to AJ for the win.
future will tell
Gotta give props to Derrick James
He really shouldn't fight Fury Wilder orJoe Joyce they will destroy him.
I was at the fight aj needs to let his right go. Everyone knows Franklin beat whyte and is no mig, aj won in second gear.
Flat footed and hesitant. Not massively reassuring if you are an AJ fan in terms of beating Fury, Wilder or Usyk...
Aj still moves like arobot , i dont see any change .🚶🏽
Joshua needs to box with way more aggression and urgency
Pathetic
If Fury retires any time soon AJ needs to get to the kronk gym and learn to sit down on his punches again and get that killer instinct back as he is a shell of a fighter these days, he lost his confidence after Ruiz and it worked for Lennox and Fury so if I was AJ I would be on that waiting list for kronk asap. He just didn't have that killer instinct and was happy to jab ànd was nervy all fight. Such a shame as he has the blue print to be no1 in the division
Wilder next pls
Aj has went right down hill Jesus Tyson furry would finish him in a round or 2 he could of finished Franklin but he held back boxing is dead 😂😂😂
this fight just shows, how Joshua's career has been crumbling
What's a waste of space you are now joshua
AJ Needs A Jab!!!!!! 6:19
Aj is like a robot, very heavy footed
4Real. AJ fights like Jack from Tekken😂
Wilder will send Joshua(any version) into another dimension. Mark my words :)
And he wants to fight fury😂😂😂😂
Congratulations 🎉 to AJ...He needs a lot of improvement if he truly wants to go toe to toe with Tyson Fury...With love from Nigeria 🇳🇬
The only person put infront of Joshua, that his has not beaten is Usyk. With all the tension after two losses he got the W. I will take that and move on to the next one.
AJ is still on the search for the right technique
Didn’t know derick James was in his corner too bad he wasn’t there before the usyk rematch
Man this fight was intense from the beginning to end. Joshua looked sharp n different..wow
No convincing win. To become heavyweight champ  AJ will need way more than this.
After seeing this I’m convinced Whyte could beat him… wilder would put him to sleep by round 3 fury would embarrass him. Credit to Franklin for a part timer he still threw more than Dubois has in his whole career
lul aj so bad
Aj in the 10th is holding the back of Franklin head and uppercutting him. Cheating. Ref letting AJ punch on the break and not warning him or nun. This fight was boring and a set up.
Robocop Bxr 😫
Aj couldn't even knock this guy out whoever he is
Aj would be so much better if he had more belief and wasnt so hesitant
AJ seems so cowardly and cautious for a big dude with reach. No fire no aggression. His fights are so boring…I scrolled this video to the last round lol😅
AJ is an embarrassment to our country. Secondly, why did all the men in the crowd get excited when he took off his gown?? maybe that should be the story. To be taken the distance by a fighter ranked "34"? yeah he's back alright, back to exactly where he was before the "New Dawn" No wonder Fury wants to fight him.
*this wasnt a cake walk for Aj ... franklin is a  wolverine...he  had courage, sting, endurance and great chin, yet, Aj had better answers and so he won ... congrats to both fighters*
AJ is back?!? You're funny mate!
Nawh the end of 11 the ref wrong for that hahaha!!
AJ No KO No Fun. Bad Fight 😅😅😅
So he won on points... With the reach advantage he has on Franklin it would be a miracle if he didn't. Let us see Joshua vs Wilder, if he can take that one home, you may say he's back.
AJ made out of glass, bloody nose after the first punch
Fury would KO both of these In less than 12 rds combined on the same night FACTS
The intro says AJ is back. What it should say is that AJ doesn't like to get it back. I think it was a poor performance myself. A 2-week camp I could have taken AJ.               Then i woke up.
AJ has to learn to move his head, no movement and prone for straight jabs Jermaine kept hitting him with. He looked very stiff, like if he's scared of being embarrassed.
Aj got no choice but to reinvent his self again  after losses no fighter wud ever listen after first loss of belts to take tune up fights....sometimes u gotta just fight like it cud be ya last
Aj don’t got no dog in him at the moment bro fightin real safe I don’t think he recovered from those loses
Aj well done for the win but seems slow needs regular fights
Why if u hurt him with a body shot in second would u stop giving body shots
Look how unstable on his legs Joshua is.. He's a shot fighter. He. will never be a World Champion again.
😴
Stiff robot as usual
AJ needs better trainers. More jabs!
Anthony Joshua vs ? Mark  and went the distance,the mighty have fallen
Big wow he beat a light heavyweight
AJ still fighting like he's scared of getting knocked  out , fight was a lot closer than the scoring.
AJ reminds me of watching Bruno at times. It's the mummy style of heavyweight boxing. AJ did well to duck the Fury unification match. He would of been humiliated.
AJ should fight miller
Joshua is most overrated champion in history. Had Ruiz not come in absolutely out of shape for the second fight no one would be talking about Joshua anymore. Franklin looked more dangerous and more skilled. As much as Fury is unlikeable these days he is right about Joshua, a gloryfied bodybuilder. If he fights either Wilder or Fury he knows he will lose in spectacular fashion just like he did against Ruiz in first fight and then his legacy will be gone forever. For now Usyk rules not because he is skillful but because he isnt greedy, he isnt afraid and will fight anyone, something we all thought Fury was.
Worst commentary ever so biased Joshua was poor wilder;fury, even luisz would beat him easy
AJ should look for a job ... Nigerian on a Joke ting
Joshua gun shy now smh 🤦
Just too stiff.
Joshua ko’s Wilder in 1
Oh that’s the new trainer! 😮 AJ will get better. Them charlo twins are no joke
Boring fight! AJ pillow hands! Next Jake Paul maybe! 😂😂😂
Not impressive. A win but against a very limited opponent. AJ looked stiff, lacked speed and showed he can beat a very mediocre guy.
Aj is done
Joshua constantly pulls from the neck with his left hand and hits the right uppercut and the referee does not give any warning!!
AJ The British Can Demolisher 🔥
he needs to fight wilder next or fury next or maybe retire if his hearts not in it...but still a fan favorite by the sound of the crowd😊
Big up DAZN for uploading this fight... Am on my break at work and feels so fresh to watch right now, feels like I didnt miss it. 💯 to you guys, big up AJ 🔥
I'm happy to watch it for free, but Isn't a bit out of order for those who paid to watch it live, when its on youtube so soon after lol
This figh was a clear display of AJ trying to master the basics of what he learned with James and it shows
Aj is back…..with the same old stiff, boring, cautious style. Where are the performances like against whyte and Klitzcho
watching this fight has shown me it’s set in stone that Fury would just obliterate this guy too slow for Fury and so timid
I’m rooting for AJ but he don’t seem like he’s as hungry as he use to be
Joshua's defence is dogshit
Wilder should fight Franklin next I think he kos him in 6
Wilder kills joshuas career stay away
Lol Franklin counters well he would give wilder issues styles make fights people when was the last time wilder fought
Franklin woulda been top 3 best Wilder opponents
AJ just isn't a killer.
Aj mids Joshua
I dont know why Wilder and Joshua havent fought yet. That fight would sell.
Franklin could win this if he wanted to
Fury would smoke both of them same night
Great job AJ!  You showed a perfectly measured (never gassed out) performance (great conditioning) and response to an aggressive opponent.
so what
I think AJ boxed better than some of his former fights. Though he didn't knock out his opponent, but there's more experience than exuberance in his style. Also, he had more to lose than Franklin
AJ should find another job. No energy, no dexterity, afraid of being hit, sloppy, and in generally boring fighter. He will do better in the security industry. Fighting wilder, Tyson or Ortiz may end him in a morgue!
Idk man why do i feel like AJ is trying not to lose the fight and not grt hit rather than using his attributes like size and power and overpowering the opponents🤷‍♂️  I believe ruiz and usyk broke his will
Snooze fest 😴
AJ the most over rated mf so slow
Wilder has beaten no one, only 40 tomato cans including Ortiz who lost to Andy ruiz. Wilder has to beat someone big first and prove it. AJ at least beat Klitschko
AJ gonna get sparked by other heavyweights if he don't let his hands go it's sad to see what a bumblebee like Ruiz done to him man still living in the shadow realm
I say Jared Anderson clear that board
Wilder would sleep AJ nicely
12 round snoozefest
Mehh. Trash
Congrats AJ🎉 You got the job done!
Steroids vs Natty?
AJ is washed up man he seriously need to fight these type of fighters he can’t compete with the top guys anymore.
Boring AF. Used to love AJ but he’s an above average heavy weight at best. Fury would smoke them both.
Another lackluster performance. AJ’s career is over, the only fight I would watch him with would be against Wilder.
Aj cheating, holding on to Franklin's head a lot while punching. The ref, didn't do anything. Credits to Franklin. Better boxer
He has no shot against Fury or Wilder.
Joshua somehow managed to look mediocre against a boxer who will never be anything better than mediocre no matter the opponent
nc
Joshua loss has clearly affected him mentally in the ring
AJ Pros: 1. Stamina held up relatively well. 2. His jab was quick, powerful and accurate.  Cons: 1. Looked too stiff. 2. Very little lateral movement.  3. Little or no head movement.  4. Got caught too many times. 5. Did not impose his obvious physical advantages.   Franklin also deserves credit,  especially for his quick hands and solid chin. I am an AJ fan, but he seems to be fighting with too much apprehension.  The Ruiz loss has sadly changed AJ's style, and as so many people have already said, he is more of a brawler than a skilled boxer, but continues along the boxer path. I suspect Fury and Wilder would have easily beaten this version of AJ, with Usyk outskilling him again.
I think everyone missed a lesson in boxing. AJ was toying with JF and was never hurt or fazed by the “gamely” opponent.
I swear man ever since Aj vs Ruiz Aj is just not his prime self anymore
If AJ continues to fight like this Dillan White would fancy a rematch. Since the first Andy Ruiz fight, AJ has lost his courage and is more worried about getting caught by a sucker punch.
JOSHUA DESDE LE PEGO UN PAR DE PIÑAS 🍍 KLISKOV, Y DESPUÉS LO AGARRO ANDY RUIZ , Y LE PEGO POR TODOS LADOS MANZA PALIZA, ALGO LE ROMPIERON AHORA ES UN 📦 PAQUETE,  NO LO VAYA AGARRAR JOYSE, DUBOY, RUIZ, TAYSON FURY, LO DESTROZAN ESTÁ QUEMADO ÉSTE BOXEADOR, NO VA MÁS TERROR A QUÉ LE  PEGUEN, MUY FRÁGIL QUEDO, DEBE PENSAR EN RETIRARSE, POR SU  BIEN. ÉXITOS JOSÉ DE MAR DEL PLATA ARGENTINA
Aj not a great boxer,
I didn’t think AJ won that by a landslide, Franklin did his thing.
Aj is washed
AJ gotta be more nasty
AJ lacks confidence, is all. Ruiz took it to Mexico.
Wilder fangirls, what say you? Attack ! 😂
AJ needs to retire he is too scared to throw any punches at all. Keep this man away from wilder and fury. Every since he got knocked out by Andy Ruiz he's too scared.
I mean.   Meh 🫤 ..  he looked different.  I’m use to the knockout slug fest.   But that’s what got him KO ..  so he switched his whole style up i see
well done a j . always reminds me of frank bruno , very  stiff  and to much muscle . like the game raving bonkers as a kid .  played safe and won imho nothing wrong with that a great fight from both guys .  lets see what the gypsy duck achieves
AJ should just let go of boxing and find another profession because with that performance, he will never get his hands on that title again.
I can’t believe I spent 10 minutes looking for the highlights before realising it was the bell to end the fight, where is the AJ that used to blow people away, he doesn’t seem to believe in himself anymore
AJ doesn't have a knockout power anymore just as before
Tyson Fury would win against Anthony Joshua
AJ looks so stiff
Either one would be knocked out by Wilder. That's a fact
thank f i didnt watch the whole fight , borefest
Joshua is scared to lose that’s why is struggling in the ring. Prime AJ would have finish this in few rounds
Boring
Disappointed with AJ
I'm convinced wilder would ko joshua 4rds in 🤷🏾‍♂️ aj is so stiff in the early rounds and wilder is a live wire from the start of the fight
I'd like to see a rematch with Joseph Parker. I think Parker has improved, and don't think AJ has, which would make for an even contest. Probably no knockouts, but  would be more highly skilled and more exciting than this fight
WOW DAZN UPLOADED THIS QUICK!
do you see what i see hungry or greedy.
Sorry Joshua..but this was not the performance that you need to be calling out Fury afterwards. You look so scared to let loose. Won't be paying to watch your fights again. Take a hint. You had your time. It over.  It time for you to realise that you just ain't "got it" to compete with the big fighters.
Booombsqaud
AJ is back! with potentially one of his worst wins to date. Straight 1-2 over and over again.
Joshua seems scared of something. He's not right.
Fixed
AJ needs to retire. Hasn’t been the same since he lost to Ruiz.
After you see this fight, you know better what kind of a beast tyson was!
Boring fight
AJ needs to go to the body more. He just head Hunt.
AJ too stiff
Still no head movement or body work,predictable punch combinations along with a clear fear of being KOd.i hope AJ retires soon he did well to achieve what he has achieved,nobody wants to see another Colon or Mclellan just call it a day and chillax brother.
Joshua looks better you can tell he has a new trainer and he did get tired. He definitely won
AJ is worth nothing
Wilder turn A.J into stone in under 4 rounds... Wilder would of crushed the pre loss A.J he decimates this cautious version..
Joshua still very big
Notice how Joshua didn't fade in the later rounds
AJ still the most scrutinized hw with or without the belts 😂
Aj looked sharp and crisp I like this and more composed than ever   That jab landed at will. Great performance
It’s no way this Joshua has a chance against Wilder.
Aj is back?  I didn't see anything here to suggest he could get near Usyk, Fury or Wilder.  I see someone scared to get hit staying away from a guy who's 20lbs lighter and with a lot less reach.  I had AJ winning most rounds but its certainly not the walk over he would have wanted to make it look like a serious comeback.  Franklin in there looking more like a sumo than a boxer and still ran AJ all the way.
Andy Ruiz's KO changed and humbled Joshua not Usyk's losses, He's not the same after that.
AJ WOULD HAVE 0 CHANCE V THE GYPSEY KING.  Highlights show AJ was garbage. If Franklin went for it AJ WOULD OF LOST
DEONTE Wilder Would Catch A Homicide Against A.J 😢
Not the statement Joshua wanted to make for a comeback fight.
AJ is trash big and slow just hugging for 12 rounds
That KO was pure beaty
Derrick James Did A Wonderful Job Let This Man Build His Confidence And Rebuild Is Style
AJ 🤖 needs to drink DW40 not water!  😅
AJ still needs to find his identity as a heavyweight he needs to find a style that fits him but I feel like he’s tapping in to it slowly pressure  and swarming his opponents  could be the key
Against a smaller guy after all his losses and downward spiral ? Let’s hope so then lol
Jhosua demasiado lento haci no sirve si no mejora no vale la pena velocidad velocidad
Went the distance 😅🤣🤣🤣
If these are the highlights, the fight doesn't seem that exciting. Don't think the commentator could have been any more bias. AJ looks like he's too afraid to try and finish a fight.
Don't understand why boxers always hugs on each other..its calld boxing not cuddle tme
Wilder K.O’s AJ in 3 rounds smh he’s done!
AJ need more head movement and faint. And against Fury backing straight up will get him KOd
*He Fought A Really Safe Fight...*
That was a garbage fight AJ better steer clear of Fury or Wilder... He looked stiff, scared, uninterested in even being in there...this was a bad April fool's joke of a fight..🤷‍♂️💯🚮
for me joshua is the biggest disappointment in boxing
He’s back in the win column. Hopefully he can build from this and have another world title push.
If Joshua fights this way against Wilder,  he would be KO'd in 1 0r 2 rounds. Wilders right hand would find an easy target on his chin.
Heavyweights getting boring😂😂😂
Impressive, AJ's defense(the back steps and micro-head movements) is looking almost like he's been studying Shakur Stevenson?? His power was always impressive, but now that he has tightened up the defense i'd say he is right back in the running for the top spot in the HW division??
Wayyyyyy to much holding
AJ his now playing real boxing the one from the books thou we all want the street fight like. Well done Champ
That was underwhelming AF!
Yo with Dazn highlights it’s as if you watched the entire the fight 😅
AJ completely dominated this fight and his jabs were quicker and sharper. Franklin had no chance of winning this fight. By round 10, you can see that Franklin was getting frustrated, his game plan was utterly shattered, and he did what he does best: hugging the big Teddy-Bear by grabbing onto AJ and holding onto him. Maybe AJ should just buy him a nice, cozy Teddy Bear for Franklin to hug onto.🥊
You can’t consider yourself a true fighter until you fight a Mexican- and that’s how we knew!
AJ looks like he's scared of gassing out like he did in his last two and is going for a more methodical Klitschko style. Tbf I think it suits him and I hope some more time with James will give him the confidence to stay calm in the pocket and let his shots go. Franklin should cut down to cruiserweight or put some more muscle on, he's got an iron chin and fast hands but isn't strong enough.
Joshua is way too stiff
AJ lost that eye of the tiger a while ago
They were both too cautious. AJ not the same anymore after the lost against ruiz.
Gotta say, the mandingo fight in django unchained was much better
As big as Joshua is he fights like he’s scared I can’t understand it for the life of me. He’s got no aggression at all. He needs to retire. Fury will destroy him.
if he punches so hard why does he not go to the body. i think in his last 4 fights he fought not to lose. just let the punches go. win or not. just my opinion
AJ is really trying to win back the public after that insane out burst after the Usyk fight .I like to see AJ fight smaller guys it shows you how stiff he is he should fight Beterbiev  .That will be a big money spinner
Wilder knock AJ out fo sho
AJ= Another Journeyman
👏👏👏👏👏
AJ jab needs to be quicker jabbing when he jabs you can see Franklin parry the jab or goes under the jab, he needs to work in his speed and defence more, I want to see AJ fight Frank Sanchez or Micheal Hunter.
Franklin worked 12 hour shifts in a factory before the Dillian Whyte fight lol, but AJ is still learning after 10 years as a full time pro boxer 😂, anyway like AJ but he is completely mentally broken feel sorry for him
Boring fight. Joshua looks tense, very uncomfortable and stiff, very little fluidity in his movement.
Carilah lawan yg paling mudah,paling kecil,paling bodoh hanya untuk memulihkan mental anda
Nah ,see from a viewers perspective Joshua is too timid nowadays despite all that size and power,he really needs to start relying on imposing his size and will again as he is getting older,he should utilize his careful style for the feel out process only.
Dust that AJ fella
Joshua needs to retire. He's grabbing for his life to protect that soft chin🤣😂🤣😂
AJ is finished!!!
Aj is finished
Wilder would smash Franklin and Joshua inside 3 rounds...Both joshua and Franklin are pathetic.
AJ should have KO Franklin. I don't think he recovers from the loses.
JUST BORING zzzzzzzz
Aj working with Derrick James,got him right.
Classic  boxer...AJ
AJ knows his chain is questionable and that he could gas out if he does too much, that's why he looks so conservative most rounds and instead of decisive victories he chooses to try to show off his boxing... which doesn't get him far with the elites of the heavyweight division.. he's not top 3 heavyweight in my opinion. I like AJ but Joe Joyce and Frank Sanchez would outbox AJ if not finish him.
Man couldn’t even knock him down
AJ is doing big boy in the ring, Money is powerful 😂
Needs a few more tune up fights. He’s still young enough. But agree with the comments here he’s a bomber not a boxer. Wonder what Konk gym or Evander’s trainer could have done with him 🤔
Yeah but is he really back? Lol
NO HE'S NOT.....
AJ would have knocked him out pre andy louis. Heavyweight boxing has become a joke. Bore draw😢
Fury has given us 12 round snooze fights for years, apart from wilder. But when it's AJ everyone on his back. Solid W for AJ, not the KO he wanted but with James as his trainer he will get better.
Joshua looks perpetually angry these days.  Ruiz ruined him.   At his peak, he would have flattened a tomato can like Franklin.
Joshua is looking terrible 😮
He needs to continue to work with Derek James he's looking way better his conditioning is better that's the biggest thing I noticed and his head movement is better in learning how to not throw everything with power he's getting better
not bad AJ  , looks like you got some dog in yuou .
Anthony fights like he’s sparring
AJ showed improvement, I like the fact that he was composed enough to understand keeping his distance far enough to make Franklin respect the Jab, then quickly making him respect and expect the right/over hand right to connect. Overall I give Mr. Joshua a rating of 8/10, only because he went for the KO a bit too late if you ask me. Not bad Anthony, you are back, but remember brother, there's still a lot to be done to regain that Competitive spirit that we are accustomed to watching your fights.
why did AJ grab Franklin like that? did he go insane since the Usyk loss? someone please clarify.
Can’t be a heavyweight and lack the killing instinct
Boring fight between a 'has been' and a 'never-will-be'. AJ forever psychologically haunted by that ill-fated night at the MSG
Footwork improved from AJ brilliant
Aj is stiff like a robot . Boring to watch .Frank Bruno lookalike style wise .
Aj is trash. Paper champion. They can scream he’s back and he’s amazing but the performance speaks for itself. Very poor and tired of aj talking about his improvements when he’s made none.
Cringing for boxing
My two bits: AJ seems low on confidence, needs to work on his defence, whatever the case may be, I'll always support AJ knowing that he never backed down from any fight. A true warrior.
Aj is done.
AJ needs to work on his hand speed… he’s too stiff and too careful which makes him predictable. I understand that just a punch to the head could end a fight and that’s why he’s being careful… but come on… being too careful makes him a boring fighter to watch.
Ppl sagging off aj here yet not one of them seem to of noticed that this the first time in a while aj didn't gas out an didn't look like gassing either so give the guy a break.
Clenelo beats Joshua!
He’s got no hope against the top heavyweights
The things is AJ needs a fights to build back his confidence and should not be rushed back into a fight with any of the top guys until he gets a at least 2 stoppage wins . He is still shot shy from the Andy Ruiz experience. He needs more time under Derrick James .
Ruiz took his soul.
Franklin gotta chin bruh.
He couldn't even knock him down ffs, AJ is back?? More like AJ is barely a superstar now.
Fury would have finished them both of at the same time in this fight
Tyson would knocked him out. Aj is too stiff. Like Bruno back in the day.
George foreman and Lennox Lewis could handle their big Ole ham hooks but Joshua looks like one of those old thumb operated punching puppets I have as a kid.
Reminds me of Manny Pacquiao after his KO by Marquez. He's too scared to brawl and get hit now
AJ is so gun shy.
Nobody has ever knocked Franklin out so all of this critique is 🧢 the guy is tough it takes away from what he brings to the table as a fighter by giving criticism towards Joshua by not getting the knockout let’s keep it real he took some heavy shots that put a lot of guys away on Joshua’s resume
Wilder vs joshua battle of the losers
That's why boxing is dying!! Hugging and holding the entire fight!🤢
A shell of himself, Wilder in 5..
Boxing is so dead I had no idea this was even happening
Pacquiao still got a bigger head than these heavyweights.
I love and prefer Joshua over wilder but I don’t see him surviving against wilder
Joshua just hang does gloves no chance at the top of the food chain
This not the same Anthony Joshua that beat kilitchco
Snooze fest.
He actually fights like a robot for real
Why is AJ so flat footed
He needs to fight deontay wilder. That’s the only fight we want to see
AJ makes me wanna sleep
To much hugging in boxing flat out
AJ wouldn't dare calling out Wilder
Back? One of his worst performances.
Wilder will smoke his salmon if he dares to step to the Bronze Bomber.
i am 68 years old and i was watching another frank bruno again. far from world-class.
AJ vs Joe Joyce and Andy Ruiz vs Jermaine Franklin are two fights I wouldn't mind seeing happen next for both guys
It's almost like.. AJ is too much of a nice guy to be the next mike tyson.. Doesn't have to mean we start going round bitin' people's ears off though lol.. twice
Even the commentator is bias favor of joshua
Not convinced!
AJ is stiffer than ever since the switch to James. He's robotic in every way and predictable. Hopefully he doesn't fight Fury this year because that beating would end his career,...and he should certainly stay away from Wilder because he'll end up in a coma. He's a shadow of his former self he's deteriorated beyond return, he still looks the part though but can't compete against the top 3 in the division.
Bruno he’s back 😂
Heavyweight vs SUPER HEAVYWEIGHT 🤣
A.J was too tight and too slow.
Joshua is still the same robotic fighter he always been. Any movement from his opposition displays his vulnerability just as Usyk done. If I'm Joshua l hang it up, he should have well over 60 million to call it a career to fall back on.
I wish frank would’ve used more head movements to close the distance
Bigger men like fury Joyce make there size known from rnd 1..they use it..they box and fight..every one fancys there chances now and the payday aj brings..it's only a matter of time b4 a big name kos him completely..
Aj needs to retire he has to be the softest heavyweight to ever hold a belt all hype
He needs to stop being scared he needs to be more brave and let his hands go he’s so scared to trade shots he scared to get hit it’s embarrassing your a  heavyweight mate
Absolutely terrible performance by Aj I expected a knock out  Lennox Lewis once said float like a butterfly stings like a wasp not a bee  Aj don’t fight the big dog in this devision  Like Dubois, joe joyce, deontay wilder ohh and the gypsy king Tyson fury
The name of the sport is hit and not get hit, I think Derrick James makes use of AJ physical attributes, AJ won effortlessly. Imagine a KO artist AJ with sound fundamentals. If he continues until next year he could reclaim it all.
AJ needs to get back into the habit of walking people down; he’s been giving way too much respect to his opponents of late.
major win by AJ loved it all, glad Jermaine don't have to go back to working at home depot
AJ looks he needs a coach to help him understand his body’s strengths and weaknesses in the ring, he just looks uncomfortable & unimpressive.. Or maybe just needs a lay
AJ hasn’t been the same since he got KOd by Ruiz… 😢
Aj is gun shy clearly a Fighter lacking confidence
Thought Joshua was looking quick and moving well ,,but i had the speed on 2x .....
They say usyk..I think ruiz took something from aj
That looked like really hard work for AJ & he didn't look comfortable at all. People need to stop making excuses for him. At this stage in his career he seems like he's a very fragile fighter just milking as much money as poss.
Nice uppercut at 7:11. But well not gonna lie, Joshua does look less confident in the ring this time around and less flexible or more static. Aside from the sharpness of jabs i was happier to see him against usyk 2nd fight although he lost. A lot of it in sports is mental, specially with elite athletes
The old AJ would’ve had him out in 5 rounds.   Fair enough if he wants to play it safe, it just isn’t as entertaining
Joshua fought well…Franklin chin save him a lot
Aj so slow, he’s done
How Is AJ Back When He Beat Someone Who Just Lost To A Nikka That AJ Knocked Out Already? Huh 🤦‍♂️
AJ the Champ is back 🔥🔥🔥
Is Franklin even ranked in the top 20... fight a SOMEBODY
dazn best highlights in the game , pbc has 30 second ones lol
aj could have won this fight so easily that it was too easy in my opinion like come on .
boring match
Aj is my favorite his physique I'd amazing and he has great attributes that can contribute to him being a great champ, but he is stiff. Let them hands go. Ever since Andy ruiz it seems like he holds back.
Not a fine boxing in real sense..I expected a fight!
Jermaine wanted to cuddle in the last 2 rounds and I thought AJ could have put on a betting performance considering the size difference as well
Lot more fluid...lot more room for improvement
Joshua is wack just like every other UK fighter
Shocking commentary
Boring fight
I’ve never been a AJ fan. Yet, I must admit I see DJ training implemented in his first fight. He actually worked off his jab for 12 rounds, no wild punches in bunches. He used the RH when necessary. He just needs to believe in his jab more and the fundamentals DJ is teaching him. Don’t need a KO, if you can actually box. He boxed well this fight.
AJ holds too much
Aj doesnt  fight like he is hungry, dude is at the end of his career,he doesn't even give wild attacks. He had a lot of opportunities to hit very hard and finish this guy in less than 5 rounds. Aj fights like he scared 😔
Ever since that Ruiz KO he has been extremely gun shy. In the two Usyk fights and this fight it’s clear as day he’s not the same fighter anymore. Ruiz started the downfall and Usyk hammered the nails into his coffin. He’ll never be champion again unfortunately.
im bored
Fury would utterly embarrass AJ. That fight is never getting made.
He not ready for wilder or fury ......that was so boring too....
AJ should fight the real one Wilder, Andy or Ortiz
AJ looked in amazing physical shape, he hardly lost a round against an unbeaten fighter in most people eyes. If he was in this physical condition for the 2nd Usyk fight, which was competive who knows. We done AJ and team.
Wilder will destroy AJ
Can’t hear the name RUIZ no more…
Jermaine who!
Trash , lost to ruiz,  scared of wilder n fury, no points
Franklin to little
This was pathetic.Aj stay away from deontay or 1 punch you're outta here 🥊💥💥💥😧🤯🤕
AJ lost knockout power.
joshua'nın böyle korkarak dövüşmesine alışık değilim ve belli ki psikolojik olarak kendine güvenmiyor
Yeah he’s back…..same ol AJ 😂. Mediocre at his best…..
Joshua is not ready to eat at the champions table right now. He is stiff, predictable and gets countered too easily. No real hunger on display and he no longer has that fire in his belly that he had back in the day. He is clearly not in Tyson Fury's league and it will be an uphill struggle to get his hands back on those belts. Honestly I reckon Joe Joyce could beat him, maybe even knock him out. If he turns up the aggression and switches up his style, like he did against Povetkin, then maybe he could get back on track - But thats a big maybe. Am i right or wrong?
Tyson would box his head off
AJ IS DOO DOO 💩 🥱. Very poor performance
A.J looks like a Giant!! Sheeeeshhhhh poor little guy
Aj mediocre
I can see derrick james been teachin him about counterpunching
My hopes were raised by the new coaching setup, but Joshua looks more hesitant than ever. What's he afraid of?
Ruiz ruined Joshua. Joshua seems too scared of getting hit like that again. It's PTSD.
$hit fight… Wilder would K.O AJ  inside of 5 rounds
Aj's ability in boxing skills is different but he must be explosive in his jobs in order to finish his opponent early
I'm stopped this at round 7... No improvement from Josh, Kudos to Eddy Hearn who has managed and Intelligently marketed Josh as the biggest thing ( BACK IN Joshes hay day ) ... The truth always comes out in the end. Josh has NEVER BEEN IT.😒🤔😏🤔😏🤔😏🤔😒😒😒
The speed on these two is infuriating. I think fury will finish them both. Twice on Sundays.
Joshua is bad
Aj back? Jake Paul would even beat him at this point
AJ FINISHED 🥱😴🥱😴🥱😴
Thumbs up for Anthony Joshua vs Deontay wilder
Getting better aj 👍🏿
Joshua🤡🤡🤡,not a boxer
😂 🤡
Joshua better stay away from Wilder.
AJ is a tank. But he don't use his body. He tries to be rigondaux in there
Both these guys should retire! That fight wasn’t even worth watching!
AJ needs atleast 5 fights for confidence. Seemed like he was afraid of being hit - too scared since Ruiz. But if he let go, becomes less stiff he can do anything really. He could outbox Wilder but could be knocked out by him easily. Fury I think would take him the distance but dance around him unless gets his killer instinct back.
Aj needs old school boxing 1/2 will get the win easy
Stiff, robotic, predictable, and slow. Joshua will never win a title.
he should retire he don't have it anymore he should've finished this guy smh
Joshua always looks so tight when he fights and he’s very stiff. He should have gotten Franklin out of there.
AJ is done
I swear the opponent knocked some guy out at Boxpark
What a boring fight
Shirt Anthony don' do too much
My boi AJ was doin the Klitschko method😂👌🏽
Gotta be AJ and wilder next
This guy just doesn’t know how to let his hands go. Literally Anthony could’ve finished this fight in 5 rounds if he pressured a lot nore
Everyone saying ‘showed great stamina and fitness’. Of course he did he barely threw anything. This guy isn’t the same beast anymore. D whyte next for him, no matter what he says he wouldn’t dare step in the ring with wilder it fury.
That dude is a lot like Andy Ruiz
The first time I dont see Joshua tired!
Джошуа никакой. Такое чувство что Боится драться . Усик забрал его душу😅
Joshua's too emotional.  I used to be a fan.
Joshua seems so unsure of himself now, poor guy
The dude needs oiled up, stiff as a board. If this Joshua fights fury he got no chance imo
An was very technical n skillfull...much respect...👍👍👍👍👍
Whos he been training with ? Mediocre performance, nothing special here..fight like that against the top 4 your getting beat aj..
Man's is not ready for Wilder nor Fury....does he even beat Joe Joyce? This Joshua loses to D white. Loses Ruiz 3....model journeyman
Wilder will knock Aj out  Trust me 💯 Fury will knock him out as well
Going to take more than 1 fight to adjust
I haven't rocked with Aj since he lost to Andy Ruiz.
The biggest overhyped boxer ever he has beaten nobody's except Klitshko who was 65 when he fought him
Underwhelming.  Give us Usyk vs Fury!
I guess no one understands what it means to transition to a new trainer, a trainer that is well respected and makes sure you stick to the game plan. 😂
I fell asleep!
At this rate I might follow Furys advice and go to a Morecombe buzzer to see a real fight. So much holding tonight
The AJ who fought usyk would have demolished Franklin.
Joshua is lucky that the fight was in UK. He had the judge and even the commentators hyped him.  They were commentators for joshua not the fight😆. Joshua got rds 10 and 12 only. If joshua fight that kind of fight in the US he can't win.
derrick has to correct all the sh they taught him wrong , everything behind the jab , he did help aj tighten up a little on his defense he is catching a few shots but he needs to grind hard its about over for him
The heavy weight division use to be exciting to watch now it's dull and boring.
Ruiz would smoke him in a trilogy
mans onthe out he aint out pointin the top 5
Credit to Franklin, he’s a decent fighter
This commentary is super bias. So many times the commentator talks about AJ missing shots and ignores Franklin's right hand counters he landed after he made AJ miss. Its like he was only watching one fighter.
Nobody knew this event happened
Solid performance by AJ
Looked like Joshua was scared to go in there
Booooooring!…..let’s see FURY vs JOSHUA!
stink fight, pair of rubber skins badgers going backwards and forwards 🤣😂😅😆
Mickey mouse boxing at it's best
Usyk’s son…
Whyte would most definitely test Aj and I wouldn’t be surprised if he knocks him out too.
All the same flaws in AJ that people have been saying for years when he was “the top heavy weight” - No Head movement, stiff, lacking any fluidity with footwork and unable to throw combinations…. His old KO mentality was great that got knocked out of him by Ruiz.   With all that being said atleast AJ got in the ring and in todays age of big names.. that is somehow respectable.   Would love to see Fury v AJ in the summer, Fury v Usyk and AJ vs Wilder in the winter. Was a massive Fury fan, but he recent sharades make me think he has  mentally gone back to the darker days.
AJ not top 5 anymore...mans mentally broken. Body language scared to get hit
A love aj! But it’s fair to say he’s so scared a getting hit after the Ruiz fight! He needs to just let the hands go when his opponent is hurt! He was heavy in there tonight but we need the old aj back! Frankling got a few decent counters on aj! But if he stands like that with very little head movement wilder would put the lights out! And fury or prob even joe joyce would hurt aj! Possibly even whyte now! He needs the flame back! But he got the job done tonight! But he was wanting the knock out but frankling moved well
Eddie wont let AJ anywhere near Fury, Wilder or Joyce. His cash cow will be put to the slaughter
nah he still the same guy. He's not beating wilder, Fury or usyk not even on their worst day. Glad he got the win and added some more money in the bank.
he's done with this sport 12 rounds to win on points. Wilder will defi spark AJ with all the shots he took off the news paper boy lol
Hopefully we can finally see AJ - Wilder now
Why would anyone PAY to see AJ fight???
Can’t  everyone see that josh and Eddie are just conning the public
This was a very competitive fight. Props to both warriors. AJ had to work and he won. Franklin is very tough and has an iron chin. A testament to the competitiveness of the heavy division. This win will aid him in confidence and will get rid of ring rust. AJ puts in the work and does not duck fights. He never takes the easy route.
Him winning a decision vs this dude means he's back? 😂
Joshua looked terrible in this fight. His jab is like a swipe, leaves him wide open..his footwork is slow and cumbersome. He’s a standing target. Wilder would land that right with ease.
I'd like to see Joshua vs Wilder.
Fighting trash 🗑  😅😂
were lucky this division has fury and usyk...
So boring 🥱
This foo fighting like every heavyweight built like a Mexican!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
What a BORING fight!!!
Joshua was way more accurate in this fight. He landed clear power punches. He blocked a lot of shots with his elbows. Great progress!
AJ yeah whatever....
Bruv i wanted to see the beef at the end thas the best bit
Wilder would put Joshua to sleep in 2-3 rounds
This was like watching a starched Bruno, No flexibility or movement, Very lack lustre
AJ need to go back to his Mexican trainer ASAP what happened to AJ? It seems like he’s scared to fight again😬 he’s stiff not lose not confident
un paquete joshua su carrera en picada
Where did all the BLOOD come from???
Joshua fighting like Bruno these days😄
i still see the same trash AJ since usyk 2 fight.
For me, the most impressive thing about Aj is having his stamina back and perfecting his jabs. Great fight
Thankaz DAZN for fast highlights
Aj apprehensive,but getting the win is top priority
Commentary was shocking for most of the fight..
Its a different game when you arent on all that testosterone Joshua was on early on in his career. Props to Franklin, tougher than anyone expected
Back hahaha terrible performance hence his childish antics at the end
AJ doesn’t have desire to fight anymore.
Not impressed one bit that's why he,l never be champion
Anthony Joshua is trash. Idk why eddy keeps saving his career.
Joshua is just way too flat footed. Wilder and Fury both would beat him. Wilder would KO him easily
He can keep changing trainers, but if he's gun shy and scared to enter the line of fire, he ain't going nowhere. I think he should think very well about what he wants to do in his boxing career. 🤔
Great content thank you I've subscribed 👍👍
Anthony don't have it in him anymore tbh
Reminds me of Frank Bruno. Stiff and slow. I want him to do well but imagine what Fury or Wilder would do to that walking punchbag? No wonder he won't fight them. Smart decision.  Never heard of Franklin btw...click like if you have never heard of him either.
He's being too scared in there and that's his downfall.
So und jetzt bitte wieder richtige Gegner boxen.....
He’s lost his killer instinct unfortunately,he’s made his money and should retire while he still has his health.
He's scared to hit. He's not Joshua anymore.
Not the most convincing comeback but AJ is back in the game
Can't help but have more respect for Franklin than AJ after thsi fight. Wilder, Fury or even Joe Joyce put AJ's lights out.
What highlights ?
Joshua still hasn't got his confidence back. He was a bit hesitant. Im glad he won though.
AJ is finished, he has no speed or stamina to continue boxing. He should retire
Franklin got a chin of titanium slathered in concrete.
A win is a win great job AJ keep grinding
Eddy reynoso the only trainer who can save AJ career.
AJ doesn't look great here in these highlights. Looks pretty stiff, and trigger shy. He just doesn't look comfortable.
Very technical and and great staminate till the end of the fight against a Speedy Gonzales. New coach is doing well.
Wilder would had this dude out of there in 45 seconds 😂and I mean joshua
#1 problem for Josh.  EXPECTATION.   He was unreal until Joe Parker’s promoter got in his head and convinced him he’s chinney and that Joe was a juggernaut.    Josh has 2 weaknesses. Lack of belief in himself and head movement. That is it.   He isn’t chinny at all. Look at what punches he has taken from klitschko, whyte, Ruiz etc. he didn’t get laid out.  He is too brave. And because of his head movement doesn’t ride punches. He is usually on the front foot so is rarely braced for those punches.    He need a to tense up for the punches coming his way. And impose himself like before.   He has 0 to prove to anyone.
We need more Mexicans 🤣🤣🤣

😴😴😴😴
boring fight, if Joshua can't get guys like Franklin out, he's going nowhere?
Jermaine Franklin beat Dillian Whyte and Anthony Joshua 😂😅😂
He's to stiff rigid etc he's learned nothing
Theirs no way Anthony is on wilders or furys level not enough ko or strength so pay days left Peace 🌴💯
Boring
Well I hope he wins this fight. This dudes us so mentally weak
Franklin did great, he came to win. Joshua is still a great champion but if fury and wilder are having 2 3 fights left then it's gotta be Joshua  all 3 seem like they're nearing retirement
Joshua is built like HERCULES...an Adonis, but has ZERO dog in him...very sad....very disappointing......I really do not want to see him fight again!
I think Franklin's performance should put paid to all the.excuses offered by Whyte's apologists. Franklin beat Whyte, he came to win against Joshua, and did better than Whyte ever could have hoped for.
The title AJ is back is a joke lol, he looks the same as he always has, ignored the body the whole fight!!! If AJ would literally dedicate the first 4-5 rounds to very fast jabs and LOTS OF BODY SHOTS, he would still be undefeated. The guys he's losing to including Usyk because hes smaller would of went down, in fact with Garcia as his trainer Joshua had Usyk hurt really bad in the 2nd fight round 8 he almost had him down from the body shots!!!
AJ is back alright................to loose against top competition
I’m an armchair “ former world champion “ boxing fan and I agree !
Joshua is not the same anymore, literally could have been one of the best heavy weights ever but since loss to Ruiz hasn’t been the same
Aj is done
I Had It 117-113 For Joshua, The First Couple Rounds AJ Looked Stiff And Nervous. But Once He Got It Going, It Was Over For Franklin.
Over hyped heavyweight fury or wilder would destroy aj
Joshua needs sugar hill imo
AJ hasn’t proven anything significant in this fight, he’ll still get beat by:  usyk, also Wilder and Fury.
let's just believe and accept that styles make fight , because if some of the punches landed on aj by derrick had been wilder punches, this fight would have ended early. but a win is a win and let's hope he improves . he is still scared, it is obvious, he needs the hunger and confidence back
Homosexual.
Respect to Franklin..as the underdog he really gave AJ a run for his money
Joshua is not a high lvl boxer anymore
Joshua is not great keep in mind franklin up to 8 months ago worked in a factory doesnt have the money to just train he did ok for a boxer with not many fights so in closing Joshua is not a great fighter never was most of his opponents were old or new without much fight experience  so he's not my kind of fighter .
he said "AJ is back! lol
Well I guess he proved me right again even with the victory he still doesn't show me he has enough dawg for Wilder or Fury
FURY IS THE G.O.A.T.
AJ looks more like a business man than a warrior. AJ v Fury, let's have it.
Still hesitates to much looks scared gotta just let hands go big fella
AJ just not world champion material. sad to see. he's robotic. cannot throw a combo to save his life. Doesn't have the presence to even project fear or be psychological to his opponent.
Stiff coriographed punches afraid to let his hands go is it ring rust or has he lost the fire in his belly ? Either way this style of AJ won't get the belts back I think he is capable just needs to go back to the drawing board reset
AJ is king of boxing of uk. Hahaha fury
😴😴😴😴😴😴
I think it's time joshua hung up his gloves...point's win embarrassing.
AJ is a poor boxer!! Zero confidence to let the hands go!!
Not the prettiest of performance but Franklin got controlled, those jabs from AJ made the difference plus the grabbing which I think were great but abit too much!! Congrats AJ on the W! Franklin was getting hit at will!!
Dillian needs to give Franklin a rematch
Fury and wilder next!!
AJ is washed ! He don’t got what it takes no more ! Fury would dominate him easy 💯
Joshua just doesn't have that anger or aggressiveness he used to have, he got punched into being a nice guy lol
horeeiii AJ winnnn
it is spelled BAD. AJ IS BAD.
No one seems to say anything about the referee ... he seemed to always stop Franklin when he was in trouble and clinching but would let Joshua recover and clinch when he was in some kind of trouble... Well, I guess that's the home advantage boxers get sometimes... For me it seemed very unjust and demotivating for Franklin.
AJ is too slow
​aj is trash and what an embarrassment to even bring furys name involved with that terrible performance he should of took he's gloves off and left them in the ring
😂😂😂
Joshua is soooo gun shy lol if he's that afraid to get punched he's in the wrong sport!!!! So sad! That fight with Ruiz ruined him lol
Zero confidence that he would beat any of the current Champs. He's just far to timid for such an imposing man.
Joshua is wack he doesn't even move like a pro boxer..
the Reach is too much
Imagine Franklin is actually one of the most technical heavyweights out there lol. Potentially another fury opponent? 👀💀
Joshua looked ok... fighting smart looked sharp at times... it's about winning and learning under his new coach...that delusional outside noise?... forget that... just keep fighting smart keep that jab on point... Joshua did ok in my book
Like watching Frank Bruno never let's his hands go pathetic
Can see that Errol jab coming out. Only problem is he needs that dawg like charlo has. Utilize that body work
After seeing this highlight myself, I just seem not to understand the hate on Joshua. He fought well  Yhu all just talk of ko like heavy weight division is for babies
He isn’t back
Once more we all saw that DAZN just isn't on that high level technically in order to stream high level boxing events. Directing, cameras, editing - it was all a brain dead mirror. Unbelievable.
Джошуа уже не тот 😢
He’s back! AJ’s coming for all The belts legendary fighter
if Joshua ever throws those slow jabs at a guy like Wilder, he'll end up in orbit . Very, very unimpressive.
Joshua has lost everything that made him exciting. I’m here to watch highlights because from the moment he made the choice to fight Franklin there was no way I was paying to see it
Boy I'll tell you what AJ needs to retire that's the worst fight I think I've ever seen him in his life it looked like it was the very 1st fight he was ever in the guy is completely washed up you can see has no confidence in the ring at all why don't you just retire and quit it's over for him
Wow...AJs stock has certainly dropped. He should of taken this guy out in a the first 4. Wilder would put AJ into next week.
He’s defo not back 🤦‍♂️😂
There's only one type of people more deranged than fury yes men and it's wilder yes men
Aj has 100 percent been working in his defence look how hes catching punch’s on the gloves instead of the chin 🥊🥊 respect to aj
best fight was after the final bell haha 😂😂calling out fury what a joker lol he would be crippled for life
AJ needs Lennox Lewis by his side to teach him.
Slow jab and no bodywork.  If you watch Joshua vs a Ruiz 2, his jab was faster, so were his combinations and he moved better.
💵🐄
The trashiest fight this year. Lol
12 rounds and now he wants a title fight ! AJ LOST HIS MIND
BORING!
Still the same Joshua. Ain’t moving fast as usik and hitting from everywhere
Joshua still loses to Wilder,Usyk or Fury…
Can we finally see AJ vs Wilder??
Is he tho?
Too tentative against a guy outside the world top 30. He still hasn't rediscovered his mojo. Against the top guys, he's not skilled enough to do a Usyk and box at distance. He has to get in there and beat people up like he did in his early fights. At this level of performance, he's miles away from regaining his belts.
Well based on this performance. Wilder is probably licking his chiops.        AJ has to fight better than that to have a chance
I'd beat Joshua meself after 8pints and a doner kebab 😂
Joshua still scared of fatiguing and letting his hands go he throws too many single punches no follow ups
Decent fight. Wish matchroom was still on SKY. Sky boxing is a joke and DAZN is a complete fraud. "Netflix of boxing" they told us. "The death of PPV" they insisted ... 12 month later DAZN PPV ...
Nice fight
Whyte's performance looks that much better now!
Wilder would eat home alive!
AJ is back where exactly? It seems like he was at his best when he beat Klitschko. He definitely hasn't been the same since Ruiz 1.
The old AJ would’ve finished him earlier . AJ doesn’t have the drive he used to have
AJ couldn't finish him?
All Jermaine wanted to do was cuddle. I think he's a lover, not a fighter. He just wanted a hug.
Fights like Frank B
This fight was boring , no heart , clinching from both , Joshua definitely not ready for a championship fight
Im no boxing expert but AJ would be smoked against Fury, Wilder and Usyk, they are too fast and too skilled. AJ needs some serious changes to get back his belts.
A win a win time to boost that confidence aj don’t like small guys this was a big guy be better fight
AJ is not back, hes finished, everyone knows it!
AJ glass temple exposed again.  He needs to work more on defense if he wants his career to prolong.
AJs just not the same.  Looks totally unconfident.
That’s why bindings game is too hot and not get hit. That’s why there is also a point system
Looked to me from the highlights Joshua lost
Chuc mưng Josua
We want AJ vs wilder next fight
Nice❤
Joshua isn’t the same and he def is showing that after him being beat up so much and or talking so many punches to the head he’s much slower, much more chin weak and isn’t really himself anymore at all
Joshua shouldn't fight Fury or Wilder cos his worst nightmare would come true by getting knocked out 🤣
So small 😮
Joshua vs Jake Paul next
That's a shell of AJ
Well done AJ..
Seeing aj performance in this, he better be careful with Wilder 🤦
Lets gooooo AJ Won this year is he’s year
Putting the highlights on YT 30 minutes after the fight? No need to pay thanks DAZN
Wilder would retire Joshua if they fight
meets expectations. This is AJ’s level. 2nd tier along with whyte, Parker etc. he’d get slapped around by fury, wilder, Joyce
Oooh he's back he beat a nobody oh oh oh the world is his oyster best fighter I've ever seen wow wow wow
He lookes scared
He needs Sugar as a trainer USA 🇺🇸  WYNDMOOR PA
AJ needs more time with Derrick James
And now Wilder vs Joshua
Glad I didn't pay for that
Wilder, Fury, Ruiz and more, will easily beat AJ
The commentary as usual horrendous from DAZN. 😂  Franklin breaks his nose makes it bleed. DAZN: "Brilliant punch from AJ". 💀💀💀
😴 💤
People made it seem like AJ was shot. I see it as the 2022 trainer of the year taught him to focus on the basics. His jab-2 was amazing and he stepped back to utilize his reach. The left hook was on point and it seemed like Derrick wanted him to be more of a counter puncher to keep stamina through 12. People mad he didnt get the KO but no one has KOed franklin not even Whyte who punches hard also. Great comeback fight and now he gets a two week break and back in the gym with Derrick 👍🏿
AJ is done. Going the distance against an unranked fighter?? Wilder would knock him out in 3 rounds.
Wilder would spark AJ in two, fury would do better if he didn't run in one
AJ looked so slow tonight, solid victory tho
That was fast upload. Big thx❤
12 rounds 😂😂😂 Anthony is back 😂😂😂 NOT
I had it 120-109 for AJ, but he still lacks confidence
I really want to see AJ vs Wilder. Enough of chasing the Fury fight, I never though AJ would win that anyways. AJ vs Wilder at MSG, or if AJ doesn’t want to come to USA just do it in the UK, they’ll probably get a bigger crowd anyways, to be honest.
Anyone else thought Franklin should have let his hands go more . Franklin had much quicker hands and every exchange seemed to get the better of AJ . I was impressed with AJs jab tonight and would like to see him vs Joyce next .
Absolute dogshit, AJ is never getting that belt back.
Franklin was robbed
Commentary is bias af
Aj is back huh……… Dude just over hyped…. He’s just a gate keeper. He couldn’t get c class fighters outta there…….let alone a or b class…..
Props to Franklin, he dropped me back home after the fight in his premium Uber, yes, he drove me back him right after the fight, gave him 5 stars.
This guy needs to stay away from fury and pretty much any top 5 boxer
give us Deontay Wilder vs Anthony Joshua
AJ gets the harshest criticism at times.....but i did think he looked stiff at times, maybe too heavy to really flow and let his hands go, but i got to commend franklin's chin, he took some shots that most heavyweights wouldn't be able to take
Wilder would’ve finished franklin in 4 rounds or less 🤷‍♂️
Wow they get these highlights up quick, this fight just ended 20-30 minutes ago. Well done DAZN.
Annen
Wow that was quick turnaround for the heighlights
Lol he’s back huh. Most people never heard of Franklyn. He’s. C level fighter.
Waiting!!
