Every time now that I go back & rewatch any video for Any music artist I’m wondering who on here has a f/o tape???   And the plaintiffs lawyer would  like to thank Miami for giving her whole testimony for the stand on this one…she shouldn’t have played with it. 😂😂😂  I died when I saw some guy run up and ask her to sign a bottle of baby oil😭😭😭😭💀👏 These celebrities need to get over themselves no one cares about them anymore, good riddens.

This is a fire remix but honestly needed Billy B's verse. Would have gone perfectly. No other people were needed (in my opinion).

Korman Hooker
This was a great remix
that last verse was trash 4real. These ghost writers gotta do betta
I honestly wish they would kept billy b verse. Her bars was better than everyone’s…Lola just killed it with hook…. The hook made her pop not her bars. Not to say she’s not a good rapper…the joint with bry Taylor was dope. But Billy B bars was on point.
🩵🩵🩵💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

THIS FULLY BADDDDDD.....LOVE IT
Miami could of stayed off she threw it off
lmfao trash
No shaving 😏
All bad...So diddy had a part of the demise of the two greatest rappers to have ever lived and in turn gave us da band, danity kane, and cassie😮😢.  Puffy's skin is splothy, spotty and blothy from the a!Ds, heroin and lack of bathing. He will be all dirty and sweaty and will just wipe himself off with a dry towel😮.  That dusty, greasy weirdo diddy is back at it again.   Why is that weirdo diddy posed up with his son in some cringey, sweaty, inscestuous bromance picture? This guy is sick, and so are his kids, for thinking his wack lifestyle is okay.  diddy has had the same sores on his mouth since 2016. They are probably herpes and/or hpv warts. If an individual has herpes sores and/or hpv wart scars for longer than 30 days, it is AIDS. This pathetic non-factor has the🤢🤢🤢.   The man can barely read or write. He remembers his lines, and then he pretends.   diddy has not had any income coming in steadily for years. His team knows he can't read or write... the ciroc money was coming in slow, if at all, but honestly, do you know anyone that drinks ciroc, that isn't low budget? The real owners of ciroc have fired diddy, and now diddy is out here trying to keep up appearances spending money he no longer earns.   dude is so hateful and corrupt that all he is consumed with is going around the world and spreading hiv/AIDS to as many people as possible. That's his mission along with his harem, which now includes yung miami and jt. They want you to believe that being a healthy n!gga with hiv is cool and even sexy because they get to have intercourse with no repercussions, all the time, and with multiple partners, and people pay them.  Ya'll protect yourself from the promiscuous. They have an agenda. Diddy gets paid to corrupt people of color and especially the black male. He wants them gay, infested with aids and occasionally in the back of a club high on coke, getting some hag pregnant with a baby born with sores on its mouth.  Ya'll gone learn to stop honoring that fat, at times emaciated wilder beasts.  diddy is going to have to start promoting his all white parties at the health department. If we see you at a bad boy entertainment, revolt, diddy any thing we gonna know what's up😂😅.
The best ever 🎉
Proverbs 31:30- Charm is deceitful and beauty is fleeting. A woman who fears the Lord—she makes herself praiseworthy
Disgusting culture. Absolutely horrible for children, women and society in general. People in the future will look back on this as a sad time in history. What is wrong with all of you people?
I never knew her and but I don't know which one is her but the one that was singing really fire and hard that was amazing that one is my favorite
Her songs is fire but I never even met her before but I've heard of this song

I’m obsessed with everything Lola Brooke touches. Don’t play with her 😍😍
Remix with Cardi, Megan and Nikki
Weird culture
😡😤🤬   bech
in this clip I just saw a very pretty woman dancing and I would like to get to know her, sometimes I wonder what I'm doing in France when I see the magnificent women in your clip. I am convinced with work and tenacity your sound accompanied by your talent will cross the Atlantic to flood Europe. From the way you rap, we can see right away what metal you're made of. here at home we like the real ones not those who say that they do this or that. welcome to you in France and to your whole team. I think you could do a feat with BOOBA or JUL. real French rappers
❤
Definitely needed cardi on it. But still fireee af
I'm glad that females are finally able to express themselves in a male dominated world.  Some males play with it because they don't know what they're doing. You're supposed to use your tongue and finger and make her scream in ecstasy.
🔥🔥🔥
Wanna wish good luck to all the youngins lookin for a wifey type—cuz if this is the new gen of chicks, y’all in trouble. These the type a hos that’s cool w/ big mama raisin their kids…

Lil Kim wanna be  Lola  😂🎉 Queen Latifah  ..Big lotto😂😢
truly incredible.
I can c Lola and Scar lip doing a colab gotta add Nicki as the cherry on top
5 months later and this still hits like 🔥
Caresha was the best on this one!
One of the hardest beats ever,  Lola ain't playing
This Right here is fiya love this track🔥🔥
Trash culture.
They talking shit about this song at my local fitness gym. This guy in a black suit gets mad at this kind of music
Whole lotta mf speaking on me that aint dont sh- maf bars
Surprised drake ain’t on this
I believe Nicki wanted to get on this track but her petty a** prolly shut it down because Lola was getting props from the OG's because this beat is hard. Yet she passed on it especially after she heard Latto wanted to do it 😒 The  Weird Ish bull I tell you 🤦🏽‍♀️ Why can't they all eat cuz these male rappers aren't moving any music. They're too busy catching cases, Overdosing, and getting kilt if we're being honest 🤷🏾‍♀️ So Nicki need to cut it out because it's getting old at this point 😅
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯🫴🏽🫴🏽🫳🏽🫳🏽🫳🏽
i love thisss
Am I the only one from 🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿?

Letting Yung Miami have the best verse on any record is CRAZY
Omg 😱 I love latto but tbh her vers sucked it didn’t make many sense and didn’t fit in with the song at all and young Miami’s vers was worse 😮I don’t get it they should have never done a remix bad idea 👎

This song is a perfect example of why Black People(I'm a nigKa too) will always be setting them selves back. It's all about a B getting some D all up in her or some similar mediocrity,  them 2000's generation are pathetic especially of this caliber depicted in this video. What disgrace to the culture 😤
Latto's avirex outfit with the high heel Timbs is NY to the core!!
Ummm it’s a strong Hell No really who approved this shit…This original rap was different and stood out,but lotto and yung Miami 😮 please stick to yawl own hoe music leave original shit alone..sorry not sorry she could’ve got real heavy hitters for this😮 not the biggest thots that’s popular and screwed their ways to hits…. Please don’t play with us with this crap😂 period big lotto🤮

🇺🇸 *Shyniece Thomas* - 02/01/94 - age: *29* _Lola Brooke_  _featuring_ 🇺🇸 *Caresha Romeka Brownlee* - 02/11/94 - age: *29* _Yung Miami _*_[CITY GIRLS]_* 5' 3" (1.6 m)  _and_ 🇺🇸 *Alyssa Michelle Stephens* - 12/22/98 - age: *24* _Latto (Big Latto)_ 5' 5" (1.65 m)
give them more guns so they kill eachother faster. otherwise we will have to
I thought Lola was Cecile from the flash 2014 they both bout 4"11

this song>>>
Literally Fart on Dominican Women - Black Women
This right here!! But Yung Miami 😬👀🥴
Latto verse was great and somehow sounds good in 2x speed
Just to speak to them you have to pay 100.000 just to even open your eyes 👀 around them if they touch you that like a Million dollars cash
Song cool beat fire but it’s just inspiring a bunch of gold diggers 200k for what again just to hit these woman are smart
Hug ya daughters and tell them that they’re loved
1St minute of the song is everything 😭
Only thing missing was 🗣CARDIIIIIII!!!!  If you a female rap fan you can allmost  hear her scream before she would kill it -
I’m so happy that Yung Miami had a short verse 🤡
bruh she even sounds like cardi why no cardi😭😭😭
Love Latto❤

We needed cardi or glorilla in there to replace young Miami
Love the energy
#citygirls

Cardi B would've killed this beat
What's thattttt😂🔥🔥🔥🔥👇 https://youtu.be/zj906lBlbmg
Awesome song reminds me of the 90s rap music like forreal.
This would’ve went further with remy ma and Cardi B
❤❤❤
Did anyone else notice that at 1:25 Latto has a notch in her eyebrow but it’s not there any other time🤔😂
You got it girl!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😜❤️❤️🤞🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽💯💯
I like the song and yeah chicks talking about pussy lips ,getting the big money dude clearly female entertainment which I’m cool with BUT I’m confused on why are dudes in the back ground like this is gangster music ….this is the same reason women have every right to bash men of this generation calling them soft and cant lead cuz in the back of a female video like some bitches…..a male video talking about women with women in it all is all eye can which both men and women enjoy …..I didn’t see anyone in these comments talking about any of these confused dudes Smfh !
They could’ve done without yung Miami
Play it in  75× and 1.25× and shizz is 🔥!!!!!!
Cleo slid on this smoothhh❤❤❤❤❤
I like the original better with Billy B.

I f Lola and Lil Kim made a remix Im the first to say it!
Oh she said SEE-DIDDY...HE OKAY WITH IT 😭😭😭 Im dead
I put this close to...almost on the level of a MY NECK/MY BACK AND Kims HOW MANY LICKS DOES IT TAKE? The beat is catchy. If all these females weren't beefing about nothing and acting jealous of one another this could have been like a 10 minute song with all the top females in the game
This is horrible 😭
Big names on this remix but only 9.8M views. You were missing Billy to take it over the top and keep it BROOKLYN 👏🏾 #gatorseason 🐊
First time I heard this song, I thought Foxy was back. Glad to have this chick on the scene.
No shame in it no shame in it 💯💅

How cool is this video. Usually it's the men  hanging round outside in groups rapping but this time it's the ladies and let's be real, it's way better:)
❤❤😮😮😮 cool
Lotto stay hoping on female rappers song clout chasing
I love how they complement each other beautiful energy take notes this is how the game goes FRR men let go of the child’s play because we have to many talented young men from all walks of life different backgrounds and with help from one another we can uplift to much money out her to be selfish that we should be out here working with each other building bridges not tearin them down colabin making historical marks so deep that your presence is felt years to come I watched queen Cleopatra's documentary with my daughter's and the impact was felt so deep such a bitter sweet sad story but her fierceness and her strength the love she had she left her mark like some we ain’t need any record deal to validate our music when we are spitting from the heart and love of the arts we need wake-up and open our mindset FFMC our eyes a blind person can see the fuckery and the bullish going on we can make a change with one it starts respectfully ☮️💜🙏 I was listening to #yungmiami did she say posted like I’m “urine”🤣🤣🤣 #biglatto777 #lolabrooke #stars4fame #wakeupBurlington #changewithoneitstarts ✍️🎼🌍
There’s somebody else to do it 🐒😭
Shit go hard for the chicks

They kilt it 🔥 🔥 🔥
Cardi B includes Latto’s “Put It On Da Floor” and “Don't Play With It (Remix)” on her collab Beats Studio Playlist on Apple Music.
Ayo son! Do me a favor. Go outside look left, and then look right. Then sit back and get use to that environment. Your shine is over and your pockets is drying up. You messed with the wrong one broke girl. Ask a rapper to pay your bills. Oh wait he can't even pay his baby mother bills anymore. 😂
“CARDI”
About time Young Miami rapping on beat...sheesh😮
Oh god pop smoke vibes
0:42  MY FAV PART
This was really wannabe pop smoke .  I dont feel it but the video is dope

Lola Broke should do a collab with GloRilla or Kali
I love when artists look like they having fun in music videos, tired of folks mean muggin looking serious all the time😂
Yung Miamj is 🔥🥵
Hmm? Y should I not sue you for SNL. This song. I should tell do play with it. I’m mad at u. For your lying on me and making that song about me. Yeah it’s me Zapata.
They all so beautiful and talented ❤️
I’m so lateee but I love this and love this for her yesssssss ❤
Yung Miami verse 😂😂😂😂😂 love it
Slicky Rodgers New Video Out Get GROOVY
They should have kept the first rapper cuz that first one was a hit this is some bs the video bs 😢
Y'all would've put cardi b in the remix it would've be the extra icing on the cake
I don’t care y’all ate this one up on 4 nem
Needed cardi
Lola’s voice is everything!!!! 🔥 After Latto’s verse, I stop the song tho 😂😂 I ain’t repeating sh*t no ‘pissed on & lovin’ it’ bihhhhh say 💯🤢
Lil kim wouldve been hot  on this track!!
Replace Miami with cardi and it's fire
Latto verse sounds personal… i love it❤❤❤
it's another  MEDIOCRE TRACK
it's another  MEDIOCRE TRACK
it's another  MEDIOCRE TRACK
it's another  MEDIOCRE TRACK
it's another  MEDIOCRE TRACK
LOVE EVERTHING BOUT DIS BOTH MY BABIES GAVE LOLA A GREAT VERSE AND CARESHA WAS PRETTY AF AND ILL EAT LATTO POOPIE DOOR
90’s kinda
She coulda did w out Y Miami..the verse was whack. JT woulda killed it!
Careesha carried
Latto verse yess
My  favorite song ❤❤❤🤑
Cardi B and Megan should of been on this track
So classy a woman twerking with gun shot hand signs meanwhile she cant cook nurture her kids raise a family or channel her melanin in a spiritual way. haha americans are dumb its a true statement
SHOULD’VE PUT CARDI ON HERE AND LEFT CARESHA OFF
LIT
Still come back to this video for Miami cause no😆😆😆😂😂😂
Remix just off too cold🔥🔥
Should of gotten Cardi B instead
Gross
Lato got it 🔥
Love Lattos Fit!
Cardi and Nicki Should have been on this song. I'm from NC and know this should have been a harder remix with NY rappers. It just didn't go hard. Miami can't rap and Lotto isn't a hard rap like she thinks. This ain't it. I'm sticking to the original.
1k and he got it...play with it and stayed with it. And bye NEXT...Lol
JT would’ve spazzed but Miami & LATTO did that
Miami gave me BIGGGG ENERGYYYY‼️‼️‼️ she KILLED IT‼️ #PERIOD🔥💯❤️
These ladies doing they thing! They need to get Bianca Bonnie on some of these tracks!
Cardi b would of been great for this song 💯
Her music is a.. iight
Miami really hard yall had it
Yes. Yung Miami. Diddy saw this and wasnt ok with it
Alright now, I ain’t throwing shade to Yung Miami And Latto. But all ima say is there’s a reason the Original Version has more likes and views
They look like they had fun times making this video footage. 🤪

Man..I need Lola to remix with some old school chicks!! Jermaine Dupere? Wya? I thought this would be harder!! I would like to hear this again with Foxy Brown, Remy Ma, YO YO, Mc Lyte!!!
This song is very cool but if gorilla was in it and lil durk then it would've been even 🔥 firereeed
Last girl got bars but that pitch hurts my ears
She need a 4 remix Asia doll and juice froot or drezzy and renni rucci
Nicki  should have been on here she would have killed it
If Cardi and Megan was on here tho
Is it me or the females spit better bars than the dudes now a days? Where are the Beyoncés the Keisha coles the Toni Braxton the Whitney Houston’s? Like am sayin tho 😂
After Lola B part I rewind it  Fuck them other hoes 😂😂she  did that fr s/o to errbody tho it's all love.iJBH
Cardi B pull a wheezy  mixtape  move and son this beat mam
Brooklyn needed this!
♨️🧨 Pressure All Da Way!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥💥💥😈😈😈😈
🔥
Lov all the outfits ❤

This song is the worst song created
10 piece all flats really speaks to me

they should of put lil Kim and foxy on this remix. still sounds fire, but that would have been epic. oh Remy also!!
Latto that gangsta bitch
Don't know why, but she reminds me of #foxybrown
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥳🥳
Get somebody else to do it ❤

I'd really like to hear a Lola and glorilla project
They could of left Miami off this 😂
This would be a 🔥🔥🔥 ass GROUP!!!
I need Latifah &  Lyte on the remix ❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤️‍🔥🎼❤️‍🔥
Black sheep....You can get wit this or you can get wit that
Nikki & Cardi would've been hella additions without subtracting
😘 P r o m o s m
Latto really wasn't playing with it 😮😅😂
I knew Yung Miami would suck before I heard her, I wonder why
It's caresha last line for me she really went off 🥶😮🔥
That last one messed it up
This my ish right here 🔥🔥🔥🔥
😏😏😏😏

“A whole lotta mfs speaking on me that ain’t done SHIT!” Latto said that with her whole chest and meant it lol‼️

It's good to see females coming together making fire 🔥
They need to act more girly and stop tryna act to hard.

Latto and yung Mami wasn't for this song... It's more cardi & JT
🙋🏾‍♀️ would love to hear a remix#2 with a few more ladies on it. But I enjoyed this one. 🎉
Yung Miami 🔥🔥🔥
I'm feeling this song
This girl is doing the most❤
She is so little!

Remi Ma would have killed this song
Remy Whould have killed this song

Lola Brooke is mini version of Foxy Brown 2.0
Not gon lie Latto kinda went in..
Latto is hot🔥🔥🔥
I keep coming back for latto part❤it’s lit 🔥
I'm disgusted
Caresha's voice messed up the song. 🤷‍♀️
I wasnt ready for the penny being bigger than Lola. 😂
Vita and lil Kim vibes
Sorry, no Lil Kim - Stupid as F!
Latto needs to get her country self outta here she don't sound right flowing on an up north song
Sorry I fuck wit Latto tough but both these bitches fucked the whole song up 💯
She sound like lil kim a bit
Why is young Miami on this hard ass track she is not a rapper plus she tooooo commercial,
I love both versions 🎶⭐. Gimme peso, I don't play at all peeps
Miami was fire on this not gon lie♥️ her voice fit perfect
I don’t know what talent yung Miami is supposed to have. This isn’t for her. Go back and date famous people cause that’s all your gonna get. 🤷🏽‍♀️ TRASH
I could see dabrat killing this
I can see glorilla on this… I repeat I will not be playing this remix this summer definitely the original tho🤣🤣
Cardi would've come in nicely where Miami is 😢
This needs cardi b in it
🤮   ONE DAY ALL HUMANS WHITE, RED, BLACK OR TRANSPARENT WILL MAKE GREAT PETS!  OR FOOD.
Ohh Shit!
It's always the tiny ones that talk the most ish😂
Lola and latto killed it 🔥
The Diddy bar was fireeeeee thooo
Actually love this, love the energy and everything else.
Still love this
🔥🔥!
I can hear Cardi, Lil Kim, and Remy Ma on this with Lola
Hey Ronald Cypress in Florida on the treasure coast Latto vers goes to you. Doing ya boy Adam wrong lol DONT PLAY WIT IT

Nah bruh cant believe u put them on de song mad L fo u bruh like why
Big Latto 😎😎
Omg! as soon as I read this comment I got mad because I could hear Cardi in this song, like Cardi would have ate it period.
I loveeeee me some Yung Miami ❤❤ and she killed her verse.
🔥🔥🔥🔥 NEW YORKKKKKKKKK
Let em new Gen hit em up its straight up NYC Brooklyn hiphop
Trash
Latto fat talking about a 10 piece all flats 😂
i’m sorry but the original is much better,  latto and caresha verse doesn’t compliment the song. It’s not flowing at all. when biggie and bone thug did notorious thug , Biggie  did it bone thug style and Ace that.
My idols 🙏😍😍😍❤️❤️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Bruh .. Miami rap voice doesn't fit this song.. I like Latto but her rap voice barely made it on this song too..
Yhh next
I feel like they kinda ruined the song lmao
Love❤
Latto is trash
💥
Latto lowkey dissed🤣
Cardi please
All of them went iiiiin 🔥
In jail a violation is time served Hunded bands
They could've cut Miami verse 🤷🏾‍♀️
She told “her Nigga, she need some space & homie get some acre” dat shit lit 🔥
💯
They killed it
Lola ft zorilla
My name is Lola
yall need to hop on a drill beat
🫶🏾👏🏾
It somethin about Miami voice that don’t sit right without JT. & PSA she just confirmed she gettin Diddy for 200k and he ok wit it 😭😭😭
💯 garbage
Latto's verse was HARD.
Lolll they alright see that's why Nicki is a real rapper they really wasn't saying nothing talking bout paying for it like talk about something besides your body and getting paid for it
Lola’s voice reminds me of McLyte’s
Make one more remix with cardi b, jt, Megan thee stallion, and Trina. That will be Epic!!
pop smock female 😅
Yung Miami verse hit the hardest.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Don't play with it stay with it
I love like you 💋
🌷🌷🌷⚘♥️♥️♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥😘😘😘
🪓
Grrah!
They fucked this up on god 😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This was hard !!!!
I love this video so much, they look like they’re having the best time
Sound like a young foxy
Lotto could of went wayyyy harder smh I expected Miami part to go like that it’s cool
Take the city girl off and put Billy back on with Cardi and glo
Weak like fivio one hit wonders
Shes got that pop smoke vibe!!
BIG LATTO🎉🎉
I love ittt but I wish she would have picked niki and ice spice or cardi for this!
All the verses ATE
I loveee

S/O to Big Latto tho ❤💯🔥
Cardi would of Bent this 💯
This young lady has IT 💯😉 Lola from BK is a ⭐ her voice, lyrics & delivery, adlibs and sound effects are 🔥 get down with her if not lay down. I wish Lola nothing but continued good health, love/happiness and success 🙏❤🖋🎤😌✌.
Big lotto snapped 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lola she 🔥 i love her voice, likeeee it’s so therapeutic 😊
Where cardi b at???? Damn this would have been mooore hotter. Still hot though
Light skin girl sexy as hell
The beat is insane Cardi B and Stefflon Don would have added the percentage but have to agree the format is Real
Miami ruined the song
She seem like the type that come down south an be trying to make fun of folks, but the minute you put a Mossberg in her hand and take her to the range, she don't know what the fuck to do.  Nah, you said "don't play wit it"... Don't play wit it!
Ngl, I wasn’t sure how yung Miami was gonna flow on this song but she killed it tho, all of them did 💕😍
AYYYEEEEEE DON'T PLAY WIT IT.  SUBSCRIBE THOUGH
Lola is a breath of fresh air man!
America is the armpit of the universe
She should’ve got NY on this song! Ice Spice, Cardi & Nicki.
When I say Yung Miami understood the Assignment 💯 Straight Fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why is this white woman here?
I'm sorry but Yung Miami verse is so weak😭
YES! LOLA IS...IF FOXXY BROWN AND LIL KIM HAD A BABY!!! SHE IS BEST UPCOMING ARTIST...HURRY AND PUT OUT ANOTHER HIT! HIT US BACK TO BACK WITH HOT FEATURES AND THEN NO ONE CAN STOP YOU!!! LATTO PUT OUT SUNSHINE OR STEPPER WITH A VIDEO AND HEAVY TIKTOK ROTATION AND PUT ANOTHER ALBUM OUT ASAP.
I love this
just don't play with it ... latto.. Miami combine that's fire .. lola yous on  top
amazing🔥🔥🔥
They had fun Latto killed it AS USUAL LOLAAAA YOURE 🔥 I would of gotten Cardi and this would of been Epic but I loved what Caresha said and I usually don't....I liked it and will be listening to both versions
Billy b verse was way better than young maimi
🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾

I would have loved to hear JT on this song!
Dang her and Pop Smoke woulda been crae! This fire tho!! 🔥🔥🔥

Glo Rilla wouldn’t be bad even Cardi instead of Miami but it ain’t bad i Guess😂😂😂😂

female rappers aint been right since Mia X & Gansta Boo,,,This sound like females imitating the dudes,,,but it dont sound right,  Where the old Lil Kim type flow?
Cardi B was needed fr but they nailed it sha
👌👌👌💪🇺🇸
Billy B’s verse still shits on Latto & Miami’s verses.
I hope everyone reading this comment is doing well during these strange times. I wish you all the best, good luck and stay healthy!  ps. I love that kind of sound. It's been helping me fall asleep for years and helps to relieve stress. Thank you very much!
Latto’s verse was pure trash
Yasssss my shitttt
Nah I'm just going to click back to the original
I hope there's a version with queen b and I don't mean Beyonce. That would be real disrespectful
Messed the song up with those 2 lame burds,,,,WE WANT BILLY B!
Had to go 😂t
Yung Miami please ❤yeahhhhhh caresha
Megan Thee Stallion and mulatto Should’ve been on the remix
CARDI B WOULD HAVE SET IT OFF FRFR BUT STILL LOVE IT ❤
I feel like cardi woulda sounded niceee wit this one
I just  *LOOOOOVEEEE* your energy 😍 the features weren't necessary tbh 🤷‍♀
latto definitely got some bars on her!
Trash 🗑️!... Women have the biggest problem with Men in the world. And yet they try to look and sound like Men 🤔.. Y'all so confused and wanna be Men so bad, y'all look like 🤡's .
🎉🎉
I won't play wit it

I’m glad they collabed with my south queens 👸🏽👸🏾❤✌🏽
Song didn't need cardi b spitting when she talk sounding azz it's hype like is
A 10 on mute. Love latto tho
Im sorry but like young Miami sold this for me, its good but she the cherry on top 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
She could not have collabed cause the song was popping, then now it's not as giving.

NOOO Biring back BIlly B smh lola is giving fake vibez
latto verse was wack

🥇💯🦅🐺🦅
🔥
Did latto did a "I don't coke I don't even do Pepsi " kind a verse 🤔
Did latto did a "I don't coke I don't even do Pepsi " kind a verse 🤔
Did latto did a "I don't coke I don't even do Pepsi " kind a verse 🤔
They should've kept it NY with Cardi and Yung MA.
Cute song & video. Who Latto talking to tho when she said she'll neva do coke.😂😂
I had no idea Latto was that gorgeous😍😋
NEW YE LEAK! https://youtu.be/bQ8AIT7M9No
LATTO NEEDS TO MATCH THE HYPE🤦🏾‍♀️ she did the same thing on fnf
Miami was weak asf
imagining how how glorilla  wud land on this
idk I feel like a remix was unnecessary since the first version was better
NO SHADE WIT IT NO SHADE WIT ITTTT
Latto snapped ❤
Lola carried the song idk what latto doing and Caresha 🤨
This is a nice song, but I pray for this generation of women. Don’t no man want this 🤦🏽‍♂️
Raw!!!!
It's a no for me
I think cardi & JT voice was needed also 😉😊🥰but its still lit
🔥
Wait did Caresha say she “single and Sadity/ single and SEE DIDDY!” And then she said, “he okay with it!!” Okayyy I see what you did there ! 😍

If Cardi and Jt were on this track it would have been a 110 better especially cardi b she would have gone so hard
So obsessed
Latto 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
I like it 🤷🏽‍♂️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤love it
Seeing a lotta females rappers emerging more so than before gotta say I like it they making these Niqqas look soft 😂😂 damn not da Real Gangstas 😅
They are soooo cute 🥰🥰🥰
Cardi & Rem would of ate! They all speak the same language! Take that other sh!t back down souf!!!
They killed that!👏🏾
🔥🔥🔥
Dumpster ish
Aahhhhhh 🔥🔥🔥🔥
lattoooo 🔥yes ma'am
The original song was better than the remix. Billy b had a better verse than lato and jt. It seems like they don't want her to shine.
If you confess with your mouth Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved. Please repent of your sins and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior.
Jamming
Latto used nickis bars smh
This just made it to the hot 100 but I honestly won’t be happy until it wins a Grammy
Since Cameroun 🇨🇲 ❤
Mom she’s nice
🧸
Caresha shouldn't be in this song...didn't fit. Cardi B or Glorilla will have been better options
Yung Miami voice 😂😂😂
Caf. Ggsa 326
Miami has the best verse idc😂🥳🔥🔥🔥
The girls make the song on fire❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
All the ladies beautiful i love it they all cut a rugg❤❤❤
“Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently.
Love it!
The original girl verse was better than both of them 😂
🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹✊🏻✨🌍
We rather the version with Billy B period

Lola needs to put Billy B on to she help the song blow up first, her verse has that real Bk flow
😮  *Haram*
Oooh👹
Ceyana and Kendall brought me here
Another remix add cardi and jt
JT got the worst voice in the game
If had ft cardi b ft glorilla with them that would break the internet 💥💥💥 but this still is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏽💯❤❤❤❤
I love Miami but JT would of ate
Very great song love the energy!
Besoo💋 muah
Imagine Nicki Minaj and cardi B and Megan thee stallion on this dope sh!t....🔥baby don't play with it💯
JT should've been on it vs Miami 😤 😒
Why billy ain't in it tf
This shit 🔥
Whyyyy would she put Caresha and Latto? Smhhh they ain’t add anything. Guess she ain’t want none of these girls to outshine her
They didn't come hard. Lola did of course 😂
The beat goes off and you say “I just want a 10 piece make it all flats”? 🤔 on a NY track. Bffr. That was disappointing.
Forget that ice spice
REMIX #2 NEEDS CARDI AND REMY ON THE MIC!  SECOND THOUGHT.... NAH, THEY'LL JUST "PLAY WITH IT!" 🤬  AND YOU KNOW PUFF GREENLIT THAT LINE!!
i just want a 10 piece make it all flats 🤣 feltttt
Init
Finally on beat Ceresha😅😅😅🎉🎉🎉
One if the whackest song to come out recently
One of them sound like Megan the stallion
Yea ok give Billy b her credit like the original better 😜
The original girl second verse better than both of there’s
Yeaaaaaaaaaa 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
If Cardi was on this TRACK OMS IT WOULD HAVE GOT WAYYY MORE VIEWS
Yessss perioddd
I would not pull out with Yung Miami. There I said it.😅😅😅
I came look for Cardi,I thought she was on it when I heard it on radio

“caresha single & saddity, he okay with it, no shade with it, no shade with it” 🤯😮‍💨
Damn son where you find this 🔥🔥
Crazy. Billy B had the best verse outta everyone on this song and she's not even on the remix.
Latto was wack ....why did they decide to butcher a track that was DOPE. Stop
This slaps so hard
Maimi sexy af but cant rap bro😭
I don't usually do the Coke but I'm drinking one as we speak like the track say don't do the Coke 😂😂😂😂

Lolaaaaa 🔥🔥🔥  stop playinnnn 🤩😍❤️
Lola killed that 🔥🔥
TLC hard core…. I like it!
We need Ice Spice on this
All i see is fun this was so needed

Not hating but others would’ve a better remix . Young Miami definitely didn’t compliment this song
Please let cardi have some!!!!! She gone slaughter it

This song hits💪🏽
Lotto and young Miami 😋
I keep hoping Caresha sounds different.

latto still stealing nickis lyrics...
Now I need a Cardi and Glorilla remix.
“No shame in it no shame in it “
Careesha Please Stop!!!
I definitely think Cardi on this would've been FIYYYYAH 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Bosco on the track facts
WHERE BILLY B ?????
Sooo y’all just gonna at like Latto didn’t just steal a line from Nicki. Talking about she never do the Coke she barely do the cola. Smdh   Nicki already said…”I don’t do coke, I don’t even do Pepsi.” 🤦🏽‍♀️
Her and Aleza would kill a video together because their tones are untouchable and unique 😍😍😍😍😍. But Latto and Yung Miami killed their verses too 🤪🤪🤪🤪
I wanna see the behind the scenes this look like it was fun ASF🤣🤪😁
♻️♻️♻️
Classic vibes right here 🔥
He say im pretty yh i know!!
Latto wrecked
Latto is so fine
Will due you

I just KNOWWW LATTO was high n hungry, her face told it all and beginning with a classic “I jus wanna 10pc make it all flats” ahhh I love me some LATTO!
Definitely need cardi and jt
3 months to go until I get off of probation 😫😫😫 I want to get back to New York City!!! Orlando Florida for now
I'm obsessed with how the guys were their backup dancers 😍 usually you only see that if one of the guys is going to rap a verse
Don't play with it🔥🔥🔥😭
Latto always eat it up
I'm feelin this💯💯💯
❤
I love this!🫶🏾
I love Caresha on this!!! 💙
Yasss 🔥🔥🔥👊🏾
Yoooooo🚀🚀
So does Latto eat pussyyyyy or …..   If I see her do that peace sign with the tongue out again , I’m assume she do 😂
New York female rappers scare me 😂 voice deep as shit and they’re threatening their oops every track. I love it lol
Yaasssss Laadieeeessss!!!!!!
I'm loving Miami's verse I swear ❤❤❤❤❤
This is the hardest song this year bar none.  I can't get enough.  Thank you for this rawness.  Grammy material!
Not feeling this remix 🤦🏾‍♀️
🔥💕 don't play with it, no shade with it! 🥰
more power to all the females artist this is my jam Brooklyn baby #jwa #atlanta #miami all my home towns
Lola is really short😭❤️
Cardi please 🥵🔥
That Avirex jacket turned into a skirt set is 🔥😍
Lola looks old and young at the same time
Na this was it the perfect trio
CARESHA SINGLE AND SEE DIDDY (SADITTY) HE OKAY WIT IT..   YYYAAASSSS🔥🔥🔥🔥
THIS IS A NEWYORK ATHEM WE NEED #LILKIM  #REMYMA THEY FUCK UP THE SONG , I do like LATTO VERS NOW THAT I LISTEN IM BACK TO ORIGINAL GO HARDER
Back again I can't stop playing this
tbh its just gangster music.
Latto❤️❤️❤️
Salt and Pep on X
They mf snapped
She sound like Kim
Why they didn't put JT on the song?
LOVE This....Mauhhhhh💋
Woman sounding like a man. Too much
miami verseeeee😍
Chills. We came a long way since 2015. Love it
caresha DELIVERED. she came a long way!
Love it
Yeah she had to get some real rap chicks on it!!! NO SHE DON'T NEED NO JT, MAYBE CARDI BUT NO JT
Latto👎.....cardi would of killed it👌
Nice sweet person!@@sooo loving caring n friendly friend cool...😅😮😢😊😂❤🎉
Drop. A hundred on a penny....Carter Louis Miss...😊
This song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Billy B still had the best verse
I came for caresha and she killed it❤️
MEH! Not for nothin', I can do w/o Latto and Caresha! This 2yr old song is a BK All Day/NY Bop... Billy B did that beat justice waaay betta w/ Lola 2me. I get it though; this is how artists make the 💰 & get views. Like Click Bate in 2023, tuning in to see the other entertainers on the track, but it was lack luster for me. Love Lola though so, no shade! This would be fire if this was like 8 mins. long w/ mad rap ladies taking a turn on it!   *When Latto bent over, was anyone checking for them leopard draws on 👀.
The male groupie thing kinda blowin me rn 😂
I love this ❤👏🏽
WE LOVE IT. IM IN THE AIRPORT BLASTING THIS!!!
Lola, she crazy.  I lovet🔥
Lola brings me back to the 90s of Foxy brown. I would have wished she brought foxy brown and lil Kim on this beat. Classic classic classic. If only she knew man.
II
This one needed Cardi
Ice Spice was missing on here 😪
Lola BBG! I don’t know how I didn’t see you before I just found you and you are like a little fireball. I like it! You got a new fan and subscriber ❤ I love your style and your flow. I been watching your interviews and love your outlook! Keep doing what you doing!
Remix is Fire!! The touch of Snow on this would have cold!
This remix is too late... It's forced. Over saturation. The original with the other shorty is way better.. stop forcing Lotto and the other Slaw Carreesha. Please stop.. ORIGINAL rules
Latto handled dat
get somebody else to do it 😂
love it
That payola line was for nicki ion care what nobody say 😂😂😂😂. Y’all remember how hard nicki use to blame payola
this clown shit
Not the “I don’t even do coke I don’t even do Pepsi” flow!!! Y’all really are Nicki’s son. Kee kee and chackeling 😂 😂😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nicki  would of killed this
Hard!!!!
Zero talent. Smh, rap music has gone so far down. It's crazy
🥷🥷🥷
I came for Yung Miami 😍😍
Ummm Young Miami…I needed something more… her verse was not giving. 😢
Miami CHEWEDDDDD
Scenes changing too much
Ah ah ah❤❤🇰🇪
😆
Latto Ate 🔥🔥
HOT GIRL
Love the vibe❤
SHOUT OUT TO THE EDITOR❤
Caresha is real cute but she can't rap at all to me 🤷
Cardi definitely should have been on there...but it's still kool🤧

Cardi wlda been only one needed or Nicki   very mid ,

"He in my DM say im pretty, bitch I know" 🤣🔥
I like Miami on here
This shit slap 💯
Didn’t need the remix
Finally something enjoyable on Trending. Rest of the list is unbearable. Go watch it yourself...
Summer banger
The fact three hard hitting female rappers can be in the same room/video is major! I love this for the rap game!
Garbage original is better. Not only that we’re is girl that was original song
This song is dope i would also like a remix with some NY male rappers like fab and jim jones i think it would be cool
Caresha slid baby!

Remix is wack, prefer the original song. Next time put on cardi b or glorilla.
The video director and editer did the First Lady so dirty, I can barely see her face.
I love seeing girls team up. This was 🔥
Whole lot of muthaphukkas speaking on me that ain't done shit...... Latto 🤩  https://youtu.be/-18HQWwxNWM
I'm from Brooklyn so I'm rooting for Lola regardless! But all ladies did a great job! Lola has that foxy delivery that I loveeeeeee! Yes, Lola BK!💙❤
I love the south don’t get it twisted, but it took the drill away 🤷🏽‍♂️ like original better.
Great original but this remix is messy asf😂😂😂
THE BEAT HOTTTT.
I’m here for it !!!

Y’all go stop playing with that demon time energy. Y’all see Angela White story time
“I’m on demon time, I take men’s souls” Those type of lyrics hit different for me now that I know that kinda shyt is real! 😬
I feel like she did this to separate herself from billy it's late anyways wrong bitches
So dope! Good to see....better than that era of female rappers hating on other female rappers.
they did their thing on this one
I can see Pop Smoke, or Remy ma on here but it's still fire, DMX barking on dis.
Caresha ate down 🤭
I'll never do coke I don't even do the cola 🙄 ok wanna be Nicki Minaj
Glo and Cardi need to be in this Remix this shit Ass fr
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🌪🌪🌪🌪🔥🔥🔥🌪🌪🌪🌪
Im not usually a female rapper kind of guy, but that bar "carrying nxggxas like im prego" was nasty.
This jawn so poop 😂😂

Ahhhhh chattappp
Yung Miami did that arm dance like Diddy 😂😂😂😂
They all look like they had SOOO much fun I love it !!!!
Saweetie would’ve did it

LATTO ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥

JT would have murdered this one , too bad Lola chose too weak female for the remix
Miami could've stayed off. But Latto and Lola Brooke 🥰😍
Miamis verse was lame asf. Ain’t nobody gonna let her on nothin else.
Meg the stallion & dej loaf! 🔥 something  different
Lola brooke and latto and yung Mami killed this remix 😍 🔥 🔥
Ima stick with Billy B for this song her verse came 1000 times . This remix was not giving I'll stick to the original
PROPHESY UNTO THE FOUR WINDS TO BREATHE INTO THESE DRY BONES THAT THEY MAY LIVE.
Wifey😍♥️💰
Beautiful woman❤ but too masculine
Lola Brooke did not need Miami or Latto...
Put me on
I like this all the ladies rocked it!❤️

We need a Rick Ross, Hov, Boosie, Lil Wanye, Geezy and Lil Baby on this beat!😏🔥🔥🔥
I don’t know why but gorilla n cardi wuda fit better or replace young Miami with gorilla 🤷🏾‍♂️
Latto did good… lakeya would have done good too and cardi
I can’t take any female seriously that will sleep with a devil for money cause Diddy the devil.l I’m for the other two! ❤❤❤❤💯
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lola so mf fine 🎉
When I first heard the songtbougbt it was cardi 🤷
Latto is monogamous and I'm the same 💯
The first version is better 🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷
" The Remixx? Oh no yall didnt!!! "💕💕💕 This that Ambition aint A Sin Record.  i really liked this video!!!
If this was the original song it wouldn’t of been big it’s aight but they versus wasn’t better than Billy b
THE BEAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OK I thought a remix post to make the song better. This did not do it. Sorry.
Wow, mulatto stole Nicki Minaj lines 😢
Lola Brooke's energy is just something else🔥
Respect to these ladies, but I liked the version with Billy B rapping sounds more authentic to me! Her flow was smoother.
New york rappers have the best flow I'm sorry lol Latto and Miami didn't match lolas energy.
Can’t lie they ate 🔥🔥
Lovin' it😩❤️
Wtf???
I ain’t never doing coke I barely do the cola ice 💨 🎶

Caresha Flow is mad disgusting
Old girl on the original song was hard. Should’ve kept it all NY on this remix

Absolute trash music
❤they talking that shit
Ice spice is better than Latto 😅
Where’s gorilla this ain’t cool
Imagine Cardi B n Nicki on this lol but this also super cool
What a powerful collaboration!
Love lotto’s outfit
Caresha had the best verse! 🔥🔥🔥
The original version was better
lol this is what woman in nyc offer lol......FELLAS GET YOUR PASSPORTS LOL

Tried to copy We Go Up lol
Yung Miami ate!
Lola should’ve had a grittier rapper on this remix, like Connie diamond or fakebitches hero. Yung Miami and Latto aren’t hard enough rappers for a song like this.
Hang on, who Latto talking to? 🤔
Jt and nicki woulda killld this shit
Shoutout to Megan I miss u shordy !!
Miami was ass 😂
FIREEEEEEE!!!!!!
They should have called kashdoll she would made it more nice

SHAME ON DAUGHTERS OF ZION
She got lil Kim vibe on god
Women today are the lowest form of humans! Ya bring absolutely NOTHING positive to society!  Just good for getting pregnant acting like ho's & talking sht on social media! everyday same thing  taking sexual pix & dying for attention! 20k dislikes should tell you I aint lying! only fans ya got are young garden tools who wanna grow up to be just like ya! everyone else laughing at you & disliking you!

I JUST WANT A 10-PIECE MAKE IT ALL FLATSSS 🗣🗣🗣

Everybody played their part Love to see the girls thriving
I know y’all caught lotto stealing Nicki’s “I don’t do coke lil bitch I don’t even do pepsiiiiiiiii” she’s her son frfr. 😢😢
Cardi deffo needed on a remix
Why Latto copy Nicki’s coke lyrics 😂😂
Very fun video  Loved Latto on this
Latto girlllllllll pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeee😂😂😂😂😂😂, it’s giving COKE and someone wrote this for you like btfr, talk bout “I never do coke you barely do cola”IS A NICKI MINAJ BAR YOUR A FAN SISTER ITS OK SAY YOURE INSPIRED💀
It’s cool I guess I still like the original better
Fucking terrible the original is way better
Come check out my new release “Red Lights”
Bring Queen of Rap Nicki for remix.
THEY SNAPPED FUCK THAT SHIT !!!!
this song needs like coi leray
I liked careisha verse, latto eeeh so so  its a vibe still though
You know she tried to remake it without Billy and it's not the same.  Together they made it happen and Lola's going to be a one-hit wonder
caresha is soo beautiful but some girls failed plagiarism test
I'm so glad female rap is popping, alot of girls out hea got something to say 😅😅😅
Say what you want about Sean Combs, he knows how to whip an artist into shape. No shade, but I'm so happy Caresha can find the beats and stay on them now. Proud of her!
Nicki would have been a better choice for this remix
Latto ruined it
This shit trash why u ain’t keep billy u killed the whole song 🚮🚮🚮🚮 throw the whole song away 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️✅😫✅
This shit trash 🗑️ I’m so disappointed
Nah but where is Billy B?! personally, I think her part is way more fire than Latto and Miami put together. By the way, I love Latto but nah where is Billy B?!
Cardi where your verse at
Miami ate that TF UP!! “CARESHA single and sa-Diddy, he okay wit it!!! No shade wit it no shade wit it” 🥵🥵😮‍💨
Billy be verse made the song in my opinion but u keep leaving her out. I like both of yall but u fowl  for that
Where's Billy b why yall keep leaving her out. Her verse was better then yours 😂
Cool
Latto FIIIINE as a mug. GEEESH
shiiiiiiiiiiiiit
Shawty give lil Kim vibes
I Fuck🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕💅🖕💅💅💅💅💅
Yung Miami is a vibeee❤
My haters don’t play with it
Lola is Kim the second... This song would have been more fire if cardi joined
Shattaa
Flow on point 😅😅😅🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yo the way lotto did that avirex dress 🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🚒🤪🔥🚒🤪🔥🚒🤪🤪🔥🔥🤪
I really feel like she can remix this hella times using all different female rappers
coming for bubbling under 😝
🔥🔥🔥🔥
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Not latto using nicki lyrics
Omg latto ate asf😳
Automatic Save Song 🎧
This song needed a gangster bitch like Glorilla and cardi b
Lola should've added another new verse imo... still a bop in my book🔥🔥🔥
Yall did that... lift da rt cheek & shhtd on num
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Latto really showing love to new artist 💯🏁
Latto so mf bad
This remix fire 🔥 3 gave it 🔥🔥🔥 music 🎼
I like this
No shade with it no shade with it 🙃🫠‼️ 🔥🔥💪🏾
Big Latto always 👌
This is just noise. If you lived with cultured white people for a year, you would be disgusted with this music.
🔥🔥🔥Lola Brooke is sexy asf, Latto had me drooling and Yung Miami is a big cup of hot chocolate!🥰🤪🤪🥰
Where is billy ??
I paid attention to every lyric, like I did in my Spanish class because my teacher was a boss beauty.  These beauties did that thing. Nice
It should of been cardi b and lil Kim on the remix and big latto could of went harder and city girls be dry asf
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥they talking that talk ....
WHERE CARDI AT FOR THIS ONE!!! We need another remix
Annd whoever Directed the video, IT'S EVERYTHING! 💪🏾 Couldn't take my eyes of the screen!!! 👍🏾
They ATE THIS UP!! 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾👑💜👑💜👑💜
JT would have brought it on this track and billy B
I feel like the energy on the joint needed NY women but I understand what this does for Lola
This remix is screaming Foxy & Remy 🔥🔥🔥JT & Cardi even Dream Doll over it!!! 🔥🔥. It’s lit I love Latto & Young Miami❤❤
Behold my life
Caresha ATE DOWN
Got that Remy ma tone.  🔥
💃🏾Yass Caresha plzzz 😍 lol
Fire as always!!! But this needed Cardi…..
We’re billy at?😢
Lyrically they did that! 🔥 That means a lot coming from me.
This song was cool until yung Miami’s part came in her ratchet ass 😂they should’ve put cardi instead of her
Latto was ass
Tbh the song ass

I’m trying to figure out if someone got beef why they didn’t stop and put me in that ambulance? 😂😂
Caresha ATE 💪👏👏👏🔥🔥🌹
❤❤😅😅😅
Cardi or Nicki would’ve made this remix lit.
Trash👎
I actually loved Caresha verse
This song only needed JT  and trinaaaa....that's it...🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅 As a features .
Personally I think this song had the aggressive beat (correct me if I'm wrong) but personally I felt cardio  would have done so good with this, add it with a touch of Remy ma( don't come for me again🌚) and we are done
Where yo day one Billy at tho????
It was ok didnt really need the remix
This is cuuuute
Gotta admit tho these bars are weak AF especially for a tempo this strong and noticed
Disgusting how music has evolved into cheesy tiktok porn videos
I think Lil Kim wanted to get on this😩
Beyond dumb…very sad from degrading themselves on plantations to the big screen… its not even music just nonsense to confuse the young…just shut up n get a job and take care of your property
Get young Devyn and kenzo b on this shit right now
Hell no
We didn't need latto on this please
Shit ass culture, shit ass lyrics, shit ass beat, shit ass people.
They had so much fun. So cute 🥰
Idc they bodied n the female love n unity is real. It’s sad how these younger females getting along, but these or rather THIS old bish bitter as hell beefing with n making diss songs towards female rappers half her age as her first new single 🤦🏽‍♀️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love the tone in yung Miami rapping voice
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Uh uh, get somebody else to do it "😅
I love this!!🔥❤️
Jesus Christ loves you my brothers and sisters. Please repent and accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior before it’s too late
Don't need Cardi at all! 2 real rappers is enough. It did not need the other city girl!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
As you can see, Hip Hop is ,making a full circle to the roots and the mecca, NYC..Lola putting it on for Brooklyn..#KingsCounty

Miami did better then latto on this one #shocked
Okay 😂
I don't see what the hate is all about. I liked all of their verses. Latto ate as usual, but a lot of people were hating on Yung Miami's verse but I thought she did her thing. Looked like they had fun with this and it was sexy.
Currently obsessed with Latto.
Its good to not play around but be serious when tackling problems with spiritual intentions.
Latto killed it buh cardi b is missing
YUNG MIAMI 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It would’ve been to dope to have all the woman that’s poppin on this song. Megan, City Girls, Glorilla, Cardi, Latto

Love the collab but what happened to Billy B her part was fire I hope they don't get into beef over this💙💙💙💙🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is no different than what I saw in highschool damn near 30 years ago. More female rappers going on about money and how hot they're this and that is.......and musically there is NOTHING here. Even their hair and makeup isnt all that different from the mid 90s. This is Garbage.
It’s giving
Caresha lit this up ✔️
THEY COULDVE GAVE JT THAT DAMN PART INSTEAD OF HA
Yung Miami verse on this remix is better then JT verse on that super freaky girl remix 😂😂😂
God damn, averix is expensive.

🔥🔥🔥🔥damnnnnn
Billy was not needed this is Lola song billy is a feature she need to take advantage of her opportunities instead of coming to the internet
I love latto response to renni rucci 👏🏾👏🏾
ALL YALL ATE
I’ll stick to the original version
*Shoutout to all the masculine chicks, I'ma piss on u. Pump & dump, I ain't taking care of ya kid*
Hard …
🙄
Nah this was 🔥 my only question is who wrote that for caresha 😮‍💨😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 cuz she ate n left no crumbs
Good try but I'll pass.....women please act like ladies
Love this they all ATE THAT! However this should have been called the southern remix and then lola should have done one more remix with 2 New York chicks and called it the east coast remix not necessarily cardi or Nikki but defo New Yorkers but hey just ma thoughts. But for now this is on REPEAT absolute fireeeeee
❤❤❤
This made me realize how much I missed the city girls!
Sooo no one cares about the other girl that was on the song I see
I wanted more from Latto and Yung Miami :(
CARSHEA SINGLE AND SIDDY OKAY WIT IT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥵
❤
Yung Miami ate that up
Ent gone lie..but lotta k*llin it honestly 😮they all hard asf though 💥#GIRLPOWER❤📈
Careshaa PLEEASE🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Never say never especially if you're just getting into the industry.😁ask Yung Miami
Wonder why maimi was choosen instead of both or the other one.. shout to having diddy in your pocket.
Yes.
This track is dope asf and the best at the moment
Lola sounds like foxy a little bit.
Uuummmm, what happened to Billy-B? Why not have Kim on here instead of Miami? Like, really, wtf did she actually say? Nothing as usual. We except anything huh. Love Lotto and been rocking w/Lola since those old ass underground freestyles and Cyphers (late 2016/2017 to date). But this....smh. It's official, we have madd chick's rapping, but no women in Hip Hop.
Sick🥺🔥
I'm not trying to me mean but some songs don't need a remix and this is one of them. All three girls just have different styles. They sound great individual but on this song.... nahhh. It was just so confusing and I personally wasn't feeling it. The original tho is fire.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
🗣️I got it once I Fleeeeeew innnnn
they did thisssssss🐐🐐🐐
Nah this is not it !
Yow lato suprise me on thos one👏
🔥 HOT
I love to see the female rappers do they thang!!!! Everybody killed it!
why does this have so many dislikes??
I love how raw Lola sounds, not hypersexual either like a lot of female rappers feel like they have to be these days. And the 90s vibes in this vid are immaculate.
This is huge for Brooklyn! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
If that🍆don’t come with a check can’t lay wit it,,,,, smart girl 💪🏾careshea❤
YUH
It should have just been Lola and Big Latto, they killed that shit and yung Miami came in and just ruined it with her annoying , non rapping garbage
Lotta went hard 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ayeeee this go harddddd 🔥🔥🔥🔥
https://youtu.be/a9aQoxOtzsE Ft. #LolaBrooke 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
MIAMI ATEEEEEEE

Get somebody else to do it .
Wow Latto, that free verse was… iiii. Billy B still had the better verse. We didn’t need a remix. Isn’t Yung Miami done with rap?
Lola the new foxy brown
I would have loved to hear it over Miami
Lola taking over !!!! ❤
ATEEEE😩🔥🔥🔥
Glorilla would have ate this remix up
You can tell they had so much fun
Dope song but it can’t outplay the original version tho
Should’ve let Miami out. But Latto 🔥🔥🔥
Day song hitttt❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I love it!!! 🔥🔥🔥   I love the unity with the young ladies. They all went hard... and I think this was Yung Miami's best verse I've heard her spit. Well done ladies. Now lets keep this energy up because the men are lacking 😅
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
It’s Latto for me ❤
Caresha Ate‼️😪
HEAVY ON MIAMMIIII !!!!!!!!!

Young Miami usually run off on the beat🤣😂 but this song she gave what she was supposed to give.....she's finally elevating...good look ladies

Latto had the best verse
Wish it was FOXY ,NICKI,REMY,LIL KIM
Good beat, good energy, just need to polish the rhymes some
LATTO ate !!!
👍👍👍
It's weird seeing a female rapper with no booty. I thought it was required to have a giant fake butt. Like I thought it was in the contracts.
This really proved that girl wrong latto do songs with female artist and she do em for free sometimes but you was just mad she didn't like the song that why y'all ain't make it💕 it's okay though make a hit and she will this was hard
Not Atlanta 😂
People talking about how great everyone is...they all rapping about the EXACT SAME SHIT.....ALL OF EM' are talking about their "Pussy", "Money" and being a "Bad Bitch"?
Big Momma on deck  D🦚216

What's everyone's favourite line? Mine is "He in my DM, 'say I'm pretty, bitch I know" 😂
JT would have slid
Omg love the energy 😍😍😍😍
Love seeing the girls come together 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥 and eating
MIAMI ATEEE , latto.... next ! purrd miami 😍 gettin so much better every verse
Latto please be original, “I ain’t never do coke I don’t even do cola” don’t that sound familiar 😂. B**** please
🔥 latto went off
She should of definitely put harder female rappers on this
Kings stay away from this.
Crazy how Young Miami got time for this but umm what’s up wit City Girls music?!?!?
Did Latto just shade the fuck out of Caresha with her on the song. I caught that little diss in Latto versus.
They should have left her song alone
6ix9ine did all this in 2018 already
this is hot GARBAGE!! FAXX 💩
Yeah, but this song to hard for them and a contradiction of their lifestyle. They should be on this song.
Caresha def snapped on this one LMFAOOOOOOOOO yes ma’am no shade with it no shade with it
Latto part🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amazing! So good to see the newest generation of female rappers collaborating like this! They all ate! 🍽️🤍✨🙌🏾🎤🎬
Did Yung Miami say “Caresha single and SADITT, he ok wit it” OR did she say “Caresha single and see DIDDY, he ok wit it’????🤔
The feature could've been better. I love both , latto , and caresha. The engery they normal give just wasn't there. But hey my opinion. Shit still kill it.but damn lola
I LOVE IT!! Love when the girlys are getting along, having fun and looking fly doing it!
Sis really said aaah aaah get somebody else to do it Mami is such a mood 😂😂😂

To all my brothers and sisters in Christ advancing God's Kingdom, please know that God sees your work for His Kingdom. Don't let anyone discourage you. What you're doing is right and good. Just make sure that your spreading of the Gospel is in love, no matter what. Y'all will be in my prayers. Jesus Bless ❤️🙏
The Gospel:  (I am not a bot, I'm just someone who enjoys spreading the gospel. Much love to you all!)  The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died for our sins and rose again, eternally triumphant over His enemies, so that there is now no condemnation for those who believe, but only everlasting joy.  Peter says in 1 Peter 2:24, “He himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.”  So Christ died not only to forgive sin, but also that it might die in the lives of His people.  ~Quoting John Piper~  ALSO My friend put together a great PowerPoint about the Gospel and Jesus being the prophesied Messiah.   I'd like to share if you're interested, just reply and I can send you the link.  May Jesus Bless you!
1:58 only came here for this part. the rest is just straight up trash!

Remix weak wrong females did the remix 😂 but it’s okay
Didn’t Nicki Minaj say “I don’t do coke I don’t even do pepsiiiii”….I thought people were coming for Latto when they said she was stealing lines buttttt I have to agree with this one. The line came directly from Nicki Minaj.
Best verse: Yung Miami Best Dressed: Latto
It's so gross "women" sticking they tongues out all the time. Stay on the streets... 🤢🤮

Lola: “I don’t even got me a hunnit bands”  Latto: “tf is a hunnit bands”  This definitely feels like a diss on her own song 🤦🏽‍♂️😂 wth
WHERE'S BILLY B THOUGH... damn, y'all can't work it out. This is just okay bc Latto and Yung don't hit like Billy... they just don't. This remix is missing BB!
🔥🔥🔥✨
Don't Play Wit It 🔥🔥🔥
Toxic relationship
The push Lola been getting is insane
This women has the rap voice to make it to the top blessed Lola 🙏🏿

Caresha please go sit down somewhere you wack asf. I would have been happier if she had cardi on it. Shot out to lotto tho❤❤❤
Here for the female colabs much better then their being only one 🙄
Love this energy❤‼️ Go awfff ladies 🦾
One ☝🏾 thing I know Miss Caresha will jump on somebody track, and it always slapping👋🏾 JT doesn’t but I understand her loyalty. Latto all grown up no more lil Miss rap game. Unmatched energy from all the gworls 🔥❤❤
It was a big no for me , call me a hater . Lola girl you could of carried that alone ❤
Could have keep that.. And made another song together. Argue with your mama

Hey just a reminder that God loves us, through his son Jesus Christ, who died for all our sins on the cross and rose from the grave. We are all sinners and that’s why Jesus did that for us, none of us can get saved by our own works. Believe on his sacrifice for you. 💓

One of my favorite songs 🤣😂😊
They ruined what could've became a classic🤦
latto and caresha literally added nothing special to this already top-tier song but i do enjoy women collaborating and getting along, that's really the upside to this at least.
I love how Miami rap idc😂
I love Lola but they could have kept this in the stash, its too much wave riding in female rap and passing it off as female unity.
It was better without those 2 🤣🤣🤣🤣
It was cute
More like Lola trash and this why we choose sophisticated white women
Caresha ate that shiiii up scrumpdillyyumyum
Crazy how y’all took billy b off

This video is doing to much. All the lights and steady switching scenes. 🙄
put Trina,young ma,remy ma, eve e and thats dead Lola is crazy sick too
🎉🎉🎉
❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️🥶
Latto🔥🔥🔥
IT appears, the song is bits and pieces of other female artist meaning more than one artist..  So what is unique about it.  Video was entertaining.
I swear these female rappers have no style and I can tell more and more guys writing they rap
Love it ❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lmao, nice culture.
Sorry this was NOT IT!!!!! Trash 🗑️ throw this version AWAYYY..Billy B ATEEEE!!! LOLA JUST FLOPPED BIG TIME on BROOKLYN.
They needed my good sis Lady London on this!
Okkkk Careesha! She's definitely improving! And latto snapped as always!
Im glad to c young black Women coming together an being successful but can we actually get some Bars with some purpose, IDK without talking about shooting and assassinating another black person 😮‍💨🤔🫤😕
“Uh uh get somebody else to do it” 😂
Would have love to see Billy.
I love it...when the girls come together....but this was corney....my opinion!!
Yeah they ate
Man lola ate this joint by her self. Everything aint ment to be jumped on.
I love young Miami but she needs to bring da energyyyyyy . Overall I love it. Listening from Chicago…
Yung Miami voice annoys me.
3 diffrent cities 3 diffrent ways to don't play wit it........
This was nice ❤❤❤
No shade where tf is billy tho
This hard.💪🏾💪🏾 if you get time check out that New Baby J.🔥  https://youtu.be/wI1arNhHago
Latto had the worst verse 💀😵‍💫
Finally rap….. get yung Miami please sit down
Love seeing this ❤😍
This was🔥🔥🔥🔥 All 3 ladies did their thing and the shoot looked like one big party, folks just having fun. GO GIRLS!!!!🙌🏽🎉
THIS IS HOW ITS REALLY SUPPOSED TO BE DONE!!🔥🔥🔥 https://youtube.com/shorts/EF3gy1VPNVk?feature=share
🔥
Lottery shouldn't have been on this song if you ask me just my opinion, if you have anything to say write your own damn comment on the comment section don't you dare come for me
🔥
Oh they had fun with this one and it’s bomb af.
I needed kashdoll on this 😭
Let’s Go Giirls!❤
NOT GONNA LIE! MIAMI HAD THE BEST VERSE!!! I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT. SHE STEPPED HER PEN UP.
#womanhistorymonth #musicvideo  #ladiesslayedit  #visuallegends  🔥  #starrmazi  @visual__legends
Latto voice
Miami should’ve been first
Summer anthem
Noooooooooooooo stop lying
Don’t like the remix, sorry but am not felling it 😬😶🤔
We honestly didn't need a remix. It would have been interesting for this trio to deliver a new song
💥💥💥💥
This beat to hard for Latto and caresha they needed
First ladies dont come for me..I'm just giving my opinion.  This was only good with her and Billy spitting hot 🔥. Once I heard Billy on second verse these 2 high maintence divas I love them both. BUT THEY CANT PLAY WIT IT. TOO SOFT FOR ME. But Latto raps ❤❤❤and city girls ❤❤but this is a duet for just  lola and billy. Too bad they let the beef get between them. As us women we need to put bullshit on hold to make money. But I give this song with these 3.. 4 out 5 ☆☆☆☆ but wit billy ☆☆☆☆☆☆. I'd love to see lola and GLO get in the booth a lil city and down south..❤❤much love to all the FEMALES with voices we aren't extinct like the dinosaurs..there enough room for us to get bread too...
🤣🤣🤣🗑 females won't to be the new men so bad
Everybody came heatttt 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lola still holds the title in this song! 💃 💃 💃 💃
I'm convinced there are PAID commenters 😂
this song hits different now
Nah Latto ate that shit up 🔥
We love it when the rap girlies get together!❤
She featured the wrong females on this one, their verses were weak asf
Hip Hop lives 👊🏿✊🏿 thank God For These Young  ladies Us OGs were having barbershop talk about the music; and the way the culture was going ;Salute to All the New Ladies and Up and coming Artist.
Young Miami 🗑
Oh yea
Latto ate it🔥
Damn y she ain’t put my baby city girl JT on it.
Don't play with it you might get an VD .
Hope neither these women dont do any plastic surgery of any kind. Because they are perfect the way they are. This is a art nothing more. Rappers get old. But trends never get old.
Yes !!
🔥🔥🔥💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
This don’t need no remix.
Lola bars are crazy. She is it! Like a real lyricist she has the hottest verse!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why not come with a new verse its another track she could perform could only keep that verse going for so long at shows
No shade wit it only New Yorkers should rap New York beats cause baby this feature….
Look how Lola got Caresha actin bad wit da trigga fingaz 😂 naw but Lola my baby cousin (in my head)and boy was she servin looks and pure vibes as per usual….N nobody NObody bodied ma baby on her own track!grrwaa!!!
I love how often the newer generation of female artists comes together. They really be supporting their own.
Big Lola!!
No BillyB THAT SHIT TRASH
It’s aLways BIG LATTO fah me 👑💕
Yung Miami says hi ❤
Latto and Yung Miami on some real mission here
Lattoooooo 😮‍💨
Yo all these women killed it
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
😘😘😘
Wtf young Miami doing on here she fucked it up
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿💯💯💯💯
Nothing special
naaaaaa, who wrote Caresha part ?!!  👏🏽🔥👏🏽 everybody slid.
ABOUT LOLA BROOKE Packed into Brooklynite raptress Lola Brooke's petite frame are all the makings of the music world's next superstar: a boisterous personality, the versatility to carve her space in any creative medium; and above all the lyrical ability to hold her own against any competitor.
I need JT to do a verse 😩
Perioddddddddd
Everybody’s verse was 🔥!!!!!!!
Golden shower
Her energy ,the beat  🔥 masterpiece 🎉
How did latto still recycle Nicki coke line from we go up
I LOVED THIS!!!
That green off it is cute!!!
I know Latto was gonna yum yum but Caresha went off too! 👏🏼👏🏼
Lotto Avirex fit 🔥🔥🔥
BIG LATTO
I think she should had Cardi & Glo on the remix even though it’s to late for this remix.
Queens
100 bandssss coming always to me
Wherever I see Latto's name, I'm there 😍
Shoulda brought Tekashi along 😂😂
No way billy got took off the song thoughh😦
They ATE this up!!💪🏽🔥🙌🏽. Whoever said Lola took a “L” cause she didn’t have NY girls on the remix; is chatting. Cause first of all, she can ask whoever she wants on her remix no matter where they are from. Second, none of the NY girls get along. But it’s Lola choice & she made a great one!❤❤❤❤
Needed this
I AIN'T NEVER DO THE COKE! I BARELY DO THE COLA!!!! WHEEWWWWW
🌹🔥🔥🔥
Come thru LOTTO 🔥🔥
love seeing these beautiful women win!
That was hard 💐
This Bumps...
You can tell they enjoyed this so much LOVE IT! 🎉
The girls are flourishing!!!!
Latto always comes hard and Miami always brings the vibe...We love a rap girly collab!
Latto lowkey had the best verse
Lola is a  little kim all over again.
This was aigghtttt… 😂okay y’all did a little something ❤
Aye she need to do another remix with more female rappers. I would love to hear lady London on this💯
Happy for the women coming together but wish Billy B was still on it... No hate but her verse was 🔥🔥🔥
Ice Spice >
No shade with it 🤭
Garbage trash them hoes basic just like their consumers
Billy B had the best verse tho 🔥 🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥viiiiiiibes
John 3:16-18 King James Version 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. ❤🙏🏾
Nye Young Miami done showed out. She just tickle me. I love everything abt this song. Latto wit the 10 pc. 😂 and Lola for the win on this legendary collaboration
Lola come on B
I don’t see nobody else doing the remix better great collaboration 💓!

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Latto nailed it 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Loving the energy from all these young girls featuring each other. All different shades of black girl beauty. Forget a preference ❤
Now I need  Billy B and JT to set it
wheres jt
I'm sorry they ruined this song for me
Imagine Lola had foxy & lil Kim on this remix!!! Whew!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Damn, this is dog.
Female rappers have collaborated before . All the comments speaking on “ female unity and coming together “ as if we haven’t seen it before . And not everyone has to collaborate with each other .
Two unnecessary wack verses. The remix nobody really needed.
LATTOOOOO ATE Per Usual !!
All 3 did they BIG ONE NOT the little one! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love this girl Kalab ❤❤❤❤❤
Seeeerious 🔥🔥🔥
No shade wit it.. but I'm here just for Caresha fine ass

lmao this song is soooo bad.
We need ice spice on this
Did anybody else realize caresha used TikTok references & a lil baby references & just made it a rap 😂
The ENERGY🎰•🐊•🌴=🔥🔥🔥🔥
This was definitely entertaining to see. I know when summer jam comes up.. Lola is going to kill it for real! That’s probably another reason why Caresha and Lato jumped on the song. They going to show up to summer jam and perform this remix together. I feel it in the air. It’s going to be interesting to see.
I recognize you from my favorite Sunday show East New York.❤
This was so good❤
Scratch off diss herself 😄🤣😂
Everyone ate tf up 🔥🔥🔥
Shit men I can rap too
I'm here for caresha❤❤❤❤❤
No JT huh?

Idont know why abortion rights are so important (if condoms/b-control is 99%) to young girls these days. Maybe its the music they see/hear Plz stop wiyh ths CAP rap, none of u all are bout that at all. Especially since using a gun with those long nails aint happening. Stick to choosing ur wigs.. This is why there werent many women in the rap industry cause nobody wants to hear them act like they live this.. Streets golden rile.."dont talk bout it if u aint live it."
LolaPower
OMGGG YESSS LATTO IS MY GIRLL 😍😍😍

Sorry but a remix was not needed and I would of thought lotto was gonna be cold with it but her verse was shit so was careshas 😒
This could of stay!!
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 I like how Caresha ended her verse lol Lola is blowing up fr I wonder is a Glorilla collab is next?
No shade but where Jt
Why they girls that’s not from the hood wanna be hood so bad?😭
🥶🥶🥶🥶
LATTOOOOOO 🔥🐐
Yung Miami & Latto know how to ruin a good song real quick! 😂🤣
This song is hot this song is fire this song is amazing this song is beautiful ❤❤❤❤
Lola Brooke energy is going to be embraced by so many real females and guys in the industry simply because she is the truth!!!#ShoutOutToLottoAndYungMiami
caresha gonna eat ! per usual
🔥🔥🔥
Careshas Verse
Why did u add lotta ughhhhh
Nah put billy back on this shit 😤gmfu
Latto u keep sending for Nicki
GTFOH 😂😂😂😂😂
I love her voice 😍
You could’ve keep billy on it too
MIAMI SNAPPED!!!
I LOVEEEEEEE ITTTTT!!!!❤
Latto & Yung Miami 🔥 this remix is better than the original 3 different vibes that meshed well 🐊
🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥😔😔
These gurls understood the assignment! They all aaaattteee🔥
Y is Miami non rapping ass on here????😅😅😅😅😅
Everybody did they think and the song is a hit but latto ain't it
Lola, Latto, & Caresha have such complimentary flows and deliveries. They are great in their own ways too but hearing them work together is always a treat. I think the fanbases are generally really similar too which is nice to see likeminded people collide every time they collab. I hope someday I can gather even a tenth of the amount of fans with the perspectives that theses two fan bases have for my own music. Truly unmatched energy🔥
latto verse was trash
Okay Caresha 🎶  We see you girl!! ❤
I love caresha she did her shit on here
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
A great trip collaboration. Hope to see more from the ladies.
mid song nice video
Yesss they alll look so good
if Nicki was on this bitch it was going to be crazy omg
Latto be torching shit !!!
i love it realllll bad
I'm Here For IT! 🔥
🔥🔥🔥
Miamis moving weird. There’s live beef going on with latto idk & idc to go back and forth
🔥💨💨💨💨🥶🔥🔥🔥👀👀👀
🚮🚮🚮
🔥🔥
https://youtu.be/9RIxDRgVxbk
Yung Miami verse. Latto verse 🔥
I love Lola!!! I had to subscribe to her! Yes, come thur ladies!
Aint no way I can take y’all seriously if you say Caresha’s verse was good.  that girl can’t rap 😂
She didn’t need a remix. They didn’t add to the song my opinion. With the remix she should have added New York. Applauds to those women tho👏🏾👏🏾
Straigh garbage
This should be played on 1.5 speed 🚤 thank me later 😏🫡
c'est nul a chier désolé 🥴
Caresha is rich ni..a goals. Diddy ain't playing with his shorty Wop, and he made it public and clear. She a real general and moving militant. Bad boy and bad Girl. Powerful for the ladies "don't play wit it"
I’m the reason why this song became huge. I probably played it a million times 😂 love this for Lola! Y’all snapped 🔥🔥🔥
caresha ate
🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤😂😂😂🗣️Yung Miami just pissed Some of her friends off with this banging Collab Especially with Latto🤷🏾‍♀️
Before I listen do you all have a message for me on here..
Loved this remix! Lola always brings that energy! So good to see Miami on her rap shxt. Let's get more of the rap girlies linking up all 2023! 🔥🔥🔥
Yea this smack
Periodtttttt❤❤❤❤NEW FAVVV
bro LATTO SO DAMN BAD. THIS VERSE IS CRAZYYYYYYYYY.
OK its hot Y'all one up Queen's I like I like!💜💜💜💜💜Little ma HOT!
HERE BEFORE A MILLION 💥🗽🥵🔥
This was a nice remix!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤️
I LOVED THIS !! 😭
Talk your shit Miami
Trash ,
I'm sorry young Miami can not rap bro 😂😂😂 I still love her tho
Neva fails ❤
It’s a clear No for me. She could have done better like what about lil Kim, ? Smh some New York folks would have smashed this song ! She wrong how she did Billy B you even took her verse out
latto in that averix sheesh 👀
I like thissss it looks like y’all had fun making this too 🔥🔥
Was waiting on dat video, must say, da ladies came thru wit it 🙌👍💯
Noo shade wit it no shade wit it lol 😂
Ooh YES CARESHA PLEASE.  Lotto and Lola yall all ate the fuck up can't wait to drive from Atl to Miami and back up the 95 to New York to this
Um… Don’t play with it is such a good song. I just wished Lola would’ve put some girls from New York on it not Latto or Miami. Smh 🤦🏽‍♀️
Billy B  part was way better That was corny
Latto's verse dissection in 3...2...
YUNG M I A M I 😍😍😍😍😍
Latto skinny nah 🤦
Dis  lit 🔥🔥🔥🔥Baddie Anthem rite here
Lotto looks just like faith evans.
No shade wit it no shade wit ittttt!
Miami snapped loll
this fireeeee
The reg song was 🔥🔥..but this one def gonna get u that bag
They all killed the track in their own way. Period. 🔥
She got tinier
Caresha can't act lol (BMF) but when it comes to rapping she goes hard
I love a husky voiced chick from NY .. makes me think of FOXY BROWN in 98
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yung Miami verse got it 🔥
Yessss I love it
Ok gworls ❤
JT would of bodied this track better than Latto and Miami
Damn this is better than the male rappers
But Billy B verse is better just saying
The women taking Over Rap this Year😅😅❤❤❤❤Billy B was better tho,just being honest
🔥🔥🔥🔥
That’s so cool . I like to hear bars baby. Hit me wit tha bars . That avirex jacket is 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾.
Miami ruined the song
Love their energy in this video. They look like they really had fun
I like the other one better 😅 the timbos line was hard
Lola remind me of the young lil Kim .. that explains why lil Kim was ok stage with Lola showing her grace unlike Nicki Minaj hating, coke head ass 😂
Shoutout Lotto for keeping it goin no matter the haters yes n young Mami as well
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Aight LADIES 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They def should’ve got female rappers from NY on the remix. This ain’t better than the original. Sorry not sorry. Maybe Connie Diiamond and/or Cardi.
No kizzy Lola kan Katch it🔥💪🏽💯💯 https://youtu.be/oEiaX-mf5iM
A hit all Day summer vibes coming crazy
I like the “No shade with it” part
Latto snapped on that ass
The way the beat went off for the beginning of Latto’s verse it should’ve been harder than “I just want a 10 piece make it all flats”. I like Latto but girl what was that?
Latto should've smoked this joint.😕
Not a needed remix! 😂 Latto & caresha was POINTLESS & ASS!
Miami did itttttt
I don’t like the fact she don’t have her friend in the video
Omg I liiiive. New York, Miami Atlanta in the building.  I love it. This remix hits. Even with no remix this song hits
LATTO ATE
Internet breaker😮‍💨🔥
It’s fire🔥🔥🔥 I love everything about it but no Billy B she should’ve kept Billy b  part in and put her in the  video
They had so much fun doing this remix ❤️🔥
❤❤
MIAMI ATE AS ALWAYS I LOVE HER SM
Caresha Single and Sadiddy He Okay with it… No shade with it No Shade with it 😂😅😊 Yas 👏 Ma’am Caresha Please!!!
Ewww🤮🤮🤮🤮

Nice, but I think the original is better.
I swear, Lola the female version of Pop Smoke 🔥
Ok....I see y'all....❤❤❤❤  This girl been rapping for a minute....glad she got noticed like she always wanted..... everyone season comes at different times and at the right time
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Cardi should’ve did this remix. But its cool
Females taking over the rap game 🔥❤️
Amazing my new fav song

Damn the shade
Love it!

Wow. Shoutout to Lola getting features from two of the biggest female rappers in the game right now. If the girls will do a feature with you, you know you’re good! I’ve been following you for a year now. I wish you continued success. You’re killing it and you haven’t even begun to make your mark on the industry!💪🏾
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Love you Caresha ❤️❤️💕🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i dont Fw this remix i feel like the one with billy b was a masterpiece its really sad that Latto and Yung Miami and has been out longer than Billy b but yet that verse and flow is too sick to even been real , Yall need to give my girl billy b the credit she deserves.
GET SOMEBODY ELSE TO DO IT”‼️‼️🤣😂☠️☠️☠️   Y’all did y’all big one w this especially Miami , LYRICS CERTIFIED✅✅✅✅💯💯💯🔥🔥😮‍💨😮‍💨
❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Caresha did amazing 😍😍
B SHOULDA BEEN THERE TOO! ✨QUARTRO✨
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥
caresha ate
Yung Miami did her mf thing !!!!!!!!!
Jeeeeeeeeez 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
This fyeee⛽️🔥❤
Lola 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Well the other version without latto is better !!! Sorry!!
UNNNN UNNN UNNN UNNNNN
An said Diddy, he okay with  it.... I really want to know the details of how he deals with women... How's the work she comes whenever he wants or what what's the give and take??  ✌🏼❤️❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m here for YUNG MIIIIIAMI
❤❤❤🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lola giving me old li Kim vibez I’m loving it 🥰
I likeeee
I only like the original one sorry ‼️
Does she say "I don't even got a hundred banz?" I'm not affirming that s h i t ✨
Yo latto can spit.
Miami that verse was horrible my good sis 🥹🥹
Yesss love me some caresha and latto
Lola wanted currents on this remix i understand..that's politics,ion think it was shade to BIlly B not being on this remix & She knows that. that's why i love her but dang i still wish Billy b was on the remix  lol but uuuggh her day is coming too just cause she knows the business!!!
The other girls fucked up the song -.-
I love this for y’all
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥BOSSSSSS BIXTCHZ STAND UP....#DNTPLYWITIT
Omg New York we on fire my niccca's.....🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
Hmmmm listen to others girls part again😂😂😂😂 Idk
I actually love this 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Did that!!! They snapped and it was already a fun song
Her flow SERIOUS. Bars & even ad libs hit w/such conviction, I believe her! 😅 Unexpected from that lil pkg which makes it even wilder.  Love how Latto usually introduces herself on a track like "BIG Latto!" But the BIG part be like a BIG punch right in ur shit. She super smart in certain subtle ways only fellows understand. I'd b careful 😆😁
She's going to say it's just a feature but not having that B do the second versus is sssshady
THIS SHIT GOOOOOO🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼🤸🏻‍♀️🤸🏻‍♀️🤸🏻‍♀️🤸🏻‍♀️
Latto Went Off 🔥 ❤
Lola Applying it 🔥
Latto cleared!
this is fire all 3 of them WENT HARD...  way better then gorilla
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍
Latto verse was fucking fire 🔥🔥 smfh I hope she wrote 💯
Love to see female rappers collaborate instead of beefin' with each other. We can all win"
I didn’t like it
This remix lit 🔥 💯

Big fuckin Latto 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎
Careshaaaaa Snapped on thisssss!!!!

Latto went stupid though🔥💯🐐☄️
Latto went off
What about the girl in the first song she went hard too
Okay Caresha!!!!
latto is giving very lack luster. the video looks 🔥though.   as for Lola and Yung Miami 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Latto tough
Love everything about this remix!!
No nutty for fun, letsssss go !
Latto did that and we already know Yung Miami was coming to put that spice on it 😊💞
Should of put cardi vs miami
I liked the original version..she definitely didn’t need to add these two..Billy B was perfect..latto and caresha took heavily from it cuz neither one of them two can rap..I hate she butchered this song..she the only one who ate as usual..that was all that was needed
😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thank God they did this, the best of the best are here
Nahhhh Caresha did that
Caresha A T E 🔥
2:00 "I'm on demon time takin nggas souls."
I just know JT would’ve ate 😩
what caresha saiddddd
0:45 "I carry bxtches like I'm preggo."
they should have kept the other girl in too her verse went hard
Okkkkkkk....remix for the win!! 💥💯❤️
The original is better
Lola Brooke snapped wit this remix g👏🏼👏🏼
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
LATTO ate! 🔥
No Shade: We all know "Billy B" Killed that flow, bars & deliver on the original song 🔥🔥😍❗️ Why not kept her on the remix too❓️ #Ijs  #BillyBUpNEXTToo👑
I wish she had billy in it
Where’s my girl JT?
Some songs don't need a remix,  this being one
Latto 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Yung Miami.. did her big 1 🔥🔥
This was fire af 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love Miami but we coulda went without her & kept Billy rns
The energy in this video go hard though!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
OH YEA🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
MIAMI ATE AND LEFT NO CRUMBS !!!!!!!!
why did latto diss BIA?
lola verse is fire. latto and miami rap like two white girls who tried to rap compared to her.
They ate
This is hard!!!!!! 🔥
Billy verse was harder
Chills 🔥 I know that's right 😃
Young Miami mad trash
Lola 🔥 regardless but Ouu Miami did her 1,2 ❤️
this was so cute
Where’s Billy B? 😢🤨
This harddd🔥🔥🔥
I prefer jt then young Miami

I love this ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I wanted to like it but I don’t …….it would’ve been better if she had foxy, glorilla, Nicky , eve , Megan , hell …..even young ma 😂
I’m here for Lola Brooke but latto did what needed to be done ✅

Latto ate
I JUST WANT A 10 piece make it all flats😩😩🙈yuppp that’s me 😂💕🙈
Lola Brooke is a huge inspiration to me and I WILL produce a song for her one day.

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🙏
Should've been Glorilla in stead of yung miami.....
jt would’ve chewed this beat right UP
Hard asf 3 baddies. Go ladies 🔥🔥🔥
"Why would I dm a ni**a first when im the catch?". Facts right there, men are hunters and woman are the catch 💯
I love it!!!! What a bop!!!!! They slid and ate!!!! Yesssssss
Y’all really acting like Careesha ate that 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️her part was trash 🚮 😂😂😂😂
I think she should do a remix with Cardi B and Nicki Minaj to rep New York. This remix was for the dirty south lol and I'm a southerner
I need JT🐬🌴. 💙Blue snapped on the original 🗽👑
1:37 "I dont do coke, little b....I dont even do pepsiiii, letts seee" Nicki said it first lol, am i the only one who thought that during latto verse lol
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ooh that coca cola line was def shade to the head of the barbies, no shade with it, no shade with it.
🎉 okay 🎉
Okayyy yung Miami ate this big latto ❤ lola went crazy on this one
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
latto said ian ever do coke i barely do the cola NO SHADE WIT ITTTTT #catch it 😘
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sorry, but the original with Billy B is so much better. That's my opinion!
Get somebody else to do it!!
Like WTF!.This ain't sounding too well.!! My bad!
I mean I like the original better
Big Glo would have killed this one
i can hear the tiktok sounds now😅😂
Chile ion like the remix
I just wish she would have put some vets on this song like lil Kim or Charlie Baltimore 🤷🏽‍♀️
It’s going to be a hot girl summaaaa! 🤪🫶🏽💕
“Caresha single & saddity he ok wit it.. No shade wit it no shade wit it” 🤣🔥
Lola spit the same verse and still bodied everybody
🔥🔥🔥Don’t Play With it!
Latto and Miami wasn’t doing it for me
THIS HARD!!!!
Caresha say she and saDiddy lol y’all ain’t catch that 😂
This is heat but I like the original way better
She left billy out to bring these 2 in😂😂
Ok Lola we see you showing love💕
Dope collab!!! And I love how they cut Latto's Avirex jacket in half and turned the bottom into a skirt! Too cute!
🔥🔥🔥
Dropped 100 onda pendant that ish big as Lola 🔥🔥🔥🎱🌪️🏤

I'm happy to have followed Lola up to this level from below. Her life is a resounding example of how everything is possible. God will undoubtedly come through for you as long as you are constant in what you are doing.
I feel like Lola should’ve did another verse, but it’s lit
Latto went hard I can’t lie I love female rap 😊😊

Latto kinda underrated n she so good🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹😩😩❤️❤️❤️
ATEEEEE‼️‼️‼️ ALLUUUMMM
I see why Miami is defending herself and this verse. This might be her best one...or Top 2. She should be proud of it. Hell, I'm proud of her. ❤❤❤❤  And Latto rode that beat with precision. Her verse was hitting too. She did great. They all did. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👍🏾💪🏾💯💯💯
No, Shade ❤️ take Yung Miami out a little Kim ❤❤❤or just add Kim ❤
Miami verse!
Definitely thought latto was gone come harder
Heyyy Miami getting better with them bars. Yesss loving it. Adding to my workout playlist ❤❤❤❤

This was dope! Even Miami killed it ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yessssss ladies and latto did that loved her part
Ok now that's the move female MC's collaborating to get the bag,no egos.Good look for Lola Brooke and she should do more to build her music catalog.
I cant hear Yung Miami voice no more without hearing "Meech where is my husband" 😭😭😭
Latto went hard 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
trash
I love this video. Looks like vibes
YES!! ❤
No need for a remix lol Billy B bodied the verse on this shit
Let's Goó 🤟
These comments smh y’all stay on these clowns bodies billy was on this and young Miami can’t even sit next to her this is trash 😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m so glad she took that other girl off. !!!!!
Miami ate tf up 🔥💓
Le meilleur son de lola broke🎉🎉🎉
Man why y’all keep pausing ??? Guess y’all ain’t got no rhymes🤣🤣🤣billy will smoke everyone of them and she sounds like herself not lil Kim! ✌🏼
Crazy to think Lola and Yung Miami the same age
Young Miami? Should've picked JT she would've matched better in my opinion
Should of stuck with Billy B. This is whack!!!
Latto did not come to play. Keep coming with those coke bars too 😂😂
Big Latto , Top 2 🗣️🗣️
Sorrrrrry wasn't feeling Yung Miami verse at all. It's sumthin bout her voice that doesn't pair well with this NY Sound, guess bc she smashing DIDDY she thought she'd mesh well on this track. Would've rather heard JT instead. Latto and Lola Ate. Billy B still.the hardest of the two remix feature ladies.
I forgot saditty was a word
this ate
🔥🔥🔥
He Finna come lay in it😊
Latto and Miami did they PART say what y’all want idc I’ll get out there about BOFFUM
Straight Fireeeeee

Ok this was surprisingly very good.
Damn they took billy b off smh
Of all the female spitters…..

I really wish JT was in it ! I like the way she flows and she fit right in ! But other than that ! Eveyone was dope looking cute and I enjoyed every moment of this 💛☺️🔥

"DON'T DO THE COKE BARELY DO THE COLA"--- Late  *last year*  "I don't do coke little bitch I don't even do Pepsi"- nicki Minaj
R U Dumb !!! Yung Miami and Latto 😻😻😻
She giving FOXY BROWN 💋🖤
Keep this song going put more people on the track …. cardi …
Yasssssssss 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥
These weak bars from both features nooo lol
I don’t care what no one says the ladies did a great job. They definitely ate. I caught that verse. The lotto remix from Nikki definitely was a Fabio foreign go Up  steal I still feel that they did an amazing job hands down. This was a great collaboration of this song sounds added two rather than fully changed, or drained out.
SO I ASK, HAS A FEMALE RAPPER BEEN SH⭕️T B4🤔
If Cardi B🔥👠 was in this remix then this one would be fire, I swear☝️
Sheeeeeeesh
🔥🔥🔥
This ate
She know not to to that to Latto I hope she know with Bunny was missed up
🔥🔥🔥🔥 Ladies yall did THAT!!
To everyone watching this video show some Love for Young Miami and Latto subscribe to https://www.youtube.com/@QualityControlMusic Thankyou.
If it ain’t broke don’t fix it , this SHÌT GARBAGE
it's deadly, touch my comment Lola ❤

I'm over this song. It is not giving anything. The verses are not has hard as they cod of been cardi would of been better and maybe ice spice. Kept it nyc.
I love itttttt
Killed it ladies❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
😍🤩🥰🥰😘😘🙌🔝🔝🥇🥇🥇
“I just want a 10 piece make it all flats.” Latto knows my order too!
THEYYYY ATEEEE🔥🔥🔥🔥BARS 🙅🏽‍♀️💚💜
Shout to the 3 Hellcat Durangos in the video.! This a NYC banger.! Should’ve had Remy-Ma Cardi-B on the remix 🤔
Where is JT VERSE??😢
Miami is trash
It’s giving ICE SPICE bruh 😎
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
LOLA LATTO AND MIAMI = 🐊 x 🎰 x 🏝️ = 🔥🔥🔥
Okay girls! 🔥🔥🔥
I love it, Cardi b should've been in this too!!!
I TAUGHT YOU HOW TO GET HIM FOR THE CHECK WYDDDDDD
This song didn't need a remix. Original is a banger
Cool 😎😎😎😎
This the most gangsta video set I've seen in a while😭
Nahh this sht fireeee 🔥🔥😂😝 they did thattt 🤍
Lotto should have came waaaay harder wtf she know damn well she got bars Lola ate on this song and no justice was done 😢
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯
Exactly the mood!❤❤❤❤❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎥🎙🎙🎙
They slid on this Forreal 🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I LOVE THE GENUINE LOVE. This reminds me of how Megan/Cardi B are together, or Glorilla/Cardi B are❤️
Don't play with it❤💯💯💯
"this song influences"     I swear that night,,, i got raided for taking curve this short in orange county!!!!!🤩
🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
Lola get behind that cameraaaaa the presence EATSSSSS
It’s Caresha’s verse 🌚
Using Nicki lyrics will never make you Nicki 😢
✨✨ BIGGGGGG ENERGY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Caresha and Lola were cute. ❤
🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻
Lola verse still the best one latto disappointed me n yung miami jus gone be miami
South Africa proved 🔥🔥🔥
Would of been 🔥 with foxy brown on it💯
Caresha ateee ion know about the others.
miami fucked it up 😕
i think they finally let a real rap girl in the game since the 90's and im jus being honest theres some out there thats not even close to being seen like this
Lol Nicki finna destroy Latto for the coke diss
Just my personal opinion, the features didn't hit as hard as Lola did when this song was released and I feel like they couldn't ride the beat as easy as she did even though they've been mainstream/doing this longer than she.. also that being said when normally latto rides any beat.   Also Latto a little too focused on that coke line, it's been in the past few songs.. 🙄 like please come up with something new if you're gonna sneak diss.
Lil kim would have body this song
Yung Miami in NY checkin on Diddy, lol
"He call me baby so it's $200k a occasion" Lil baby reference on how he used to charge 2 hunnit a show
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Latto ate that!!! PeriodT
Latto slid 🔥🔥🔥
❤💯⚘️💰🏆
They killed it
6ix9ine woulda killed this
YouTube so positive 🥹the shit they talking over there by instagram😪
No shade but Yung Miami wasn't right for this song....Gol'rilla  would've been a better fit in my opinion ..no shade meant
This was ok, billy b verse was better than both of theirs but I guess she wants the exposure from latto and young Miami. But she definitely not gonna make no money off this because now the money gotta split more ways. Smh ain’t no loyalty no more. But good luck on your career.
Dpwi
😅😅😅😅 this ish hard asf it makes me feel like I have a gun
The original one can never be replicated 💀
Omg I love this!!! Just watching how good of a time they had with this. ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
They did that and Miami cumming thru I see u girl
Yesss... That's what I like to see... The Ladies collaboration together. Make it normal please.... ❤ 👍
I think cardi b would’ve made it a better remix. They ruin the song!
🔥🔥 3 baddies and they all ATEE 😍
Latto carried
Uh uh get somebody else to do it 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I ain’t gone lie I ain’t like lotto at first but I can’t deny she a BAAAAAHD JAWN 👅👅👅imma fan

Whole lotta bad ass boss chicks 🔥🔥🔥🔥😈
🔥🔥🔥 Where's Billy 😭😭 Brooke? She went so hard on the first one.  Latto 🔥🔥🔥 Miami ❤️❤️❤️ song Baddddd 🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥👑
Love to see the rap girlies together 👌❤️
Smh... the track is dope everyone did well.... but it's still an elephant in the room though... that original version still harder. Why you did Billy like DAT??  ijs..
How you from New York but didn't get no New York rappers to be on this Lil Kim Nicki Remy ma Cardi B this song really didn't need a remix
Latto snapped like always I loveeeeee it
Everyone’s verse had to be on point for this and it was ‼️
Nice track but JT would have killed it better..
Uht uh get somebody else to do it
nahh cause this got me shaking ass
This song been ruined by transgenders
disappointing
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hated this remix but proud Lola shined on the same track again bk stand upppppppp but in my opinion should have brought the real OGs to this track was Kim,Remy, Foxy, Eve ,rah digga, yo-yo was any of these options not available I would have even loved cardi on it no shade wit it 😂 😂
When is Lola gonna make a new song it’s played out real bad
It’s cute for the young girlies . I like it!

I’m sorry but it would’ve murder this beat !!!!!!!!
….
I like how they all collaborated and helped dispel the assumed friction between female rappers. 🙌🏽
I thought Miami was going to ruin it but she did a good job. Lotto threw a weak Nikki diss in I see. Welp good job ladies guess this for the spring and summer.
sometimes i like to sit on my left hand until it goes numb and then give myself the stranger
Okay🔥🔥🔥all of them
Is Miami ever on beat 🤦🏾‍♀️
Latto retire that coke verse
Billy b verse was  definitely hotter than both of those .. they both slacked real bad .. lola made a fool of herself !!

Lola gotta do what she gotta do to get on.... and she deserves it.... but this record will always be a bk anthem with the bk girlies! Her and Billy B!! Once Lola gets on though, she don't even need no features... she's too talented and her body of work is crazy...but this record was magic with her and Billy B.
it’s caresha part for me
Damn Miami did her big one okay progress

Careasha can do no wrong in my eyes she so free spirited
I'll never doing coke I barely do the cola 😂❤️‍🔥

I love all three of these ladies, they all skated on the track 🔥💕 But I wish Billy B was on this version as well 🤷🏽‍♀️

This was okay, but personally I lovvvve the original version!  Lola is fire, I like Lotto, Caresha is beautiful-but I just don't think these features did anything. I don't think the song even need a remix.

Female rap is going to be very competitive in the next few years…These girls are getting fiery!!!!
Miami fucked it up… not inna good way
Don't Play With It  Don't Play With It  Don't Play With It
Dnt fckn play wit it dey cuttin up da dumbway🔥🔥🔥😎😎😎
Как будто DMX дочка
Latto was lame
no shade w it no shade w itttt
🌟🌟🌟
I wish Yung Miami didn't jump on this. She's better than this.
this was cuuuuttteeeee
NO SHADE WIT IT NO SHADE WIT IT 💅🏾
Yurrrrr ate that shiii upppppp❤❤
Latto still trying to throw the Coke dis towards Nicki that Lil girl funny and still Nicki son😂 but I like the video Lola❤
Why caresha can't catch the beat when she rap 🤷🏿‍♀️🤦🏿‍♀️
lola always slides🔥 & what i admire is the fact that it looks like the 3 of them really had fun making this!! love to see it.
She so fucking raw 😮‍💨
Caresha killed it what?🔥🔥🔥🔥
They ate that shit up idgaf 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Latto sliding hard verses Back to Back!!!🔥🔥🔥she been doing her big one!
🔥🔥🔥
Wow  really its cardboard
Y’all ate 🔥🔥
damn did she have to REMOVE billy b to add ppl to their song?😭 like why even remove her at all that's disrespectful, why wouldn't she wanna include her.. it's not giving she for the girls it's giving she for herself. idk if i can b a lola fan anymore, she showin her true colors. she clearly doin it for clout bc this was nowhere near as good as the original if we keepin shii 💯 she so disrespectful n grimey. lola seems like she the girl to cross anyone for a lul come-up.
Follow chirst
That tiny firecracker 🧨💥🔥💥at it again 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤘🏾 keep it hot 💪🏽✊🏽 Go lola👍🏾✌🏽
Lola Brooke should’ve made a different verse. That would’ve ate. Tired of remixes using the same original lyrics
THISSSS IS WHAT FEMALE RAP NEEDED. 😭😭❤️❤️❤️ i love them alllll.
This 🔥🔥🔥
Hardest female rapper rn
Latto look like the only one that dont belong cause she lightskin
Billy B need to drop her version with Kim and Remy💪🏾no shade with it no shade with it no shade with it
This chick just made a hole outfit out of  Avirex coat it don’t look that bag pulled it off
Latto actually looks so good wow
cause lottery ticket really thought she was slick stealing nicki's lyrics, girl boo. billy b should've been on the remix, it's not fair how she's being treated but that's because she's not a sellout. 🥱

Latto is trying too hard to be like ice spice.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥💥💥
Lola is cool and I think she has a lot of potential. I also think this song is just old now, right? But this is a better Miami verse though
That shit rt there ain't nothing but FIRE 🔥💯
I like this for them
Latto ran that shit 💪🏾
Like.... Why ?
🤷🏾‍♂️
#DontPlayIt #Period ???

FYI - Lola pay homage to MC Lyte when she wants a rough neck
She should of put New York artists for the remix

Yung Miami must retire from rap🥴

Miami verse could’ve been cut and they kept Billy B.. Latto 🔥 #BigEnergy
Love this! BUT Lil Kim should have been apart of this Remix! I can hear her voice all through this record.

Let the girlies have fun 🎉
“ you fxxxked like 100 nxxxgs ain’t got one man “ 😂😂😂😂😂😂
“I don’t do coke, I barely do cola”😮 sounds like Nicki  “ I dont do coke lil’ bitch, I don’t even do Pepsi.” Latto gotta stop
My favorite artist ❤️❤️
Coochie Power Got The Whole Game Intimidated 🥵🌟🔥🔥they ate this  up

Shame they're trying to Yesterday 2
"Whole lotta mf's speaking on me ain't done shit" 😢😍 Lola did it right ... the vibes , the authentic energy ... i love this for the girls .
Where Billy B???
I think Lola go make the ones already in the game step it up. Shorty a tuff cookie. It a ain’t that regular new school rap. Shorty bringing something nostalgic back.
Lattoooooo
“They can’t stand to see me win so they blame payola” - latto🔥🔥🔥 no cap in her rap !
⚜🖤
Yung miami spazzed 🔥🔥🔥
It’s giving Ice Latto
🥰😍🥰🥰🥰😍😍🥰😍🥰🥰🥰💯😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💯💯🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰💕💕💕🥰🥰🥰🥰💕💕💕💕💕🥰💕😘😘😘😘😘

The vibes is this video and visionary is definitely giving!
When everybody does their part of the group project
$ the first music video to hit a BIL😌
I loved every minute of thisssss ❤

This song is a thousand times softer and not a single Brooklyn native this was cute for main streak yung miami best verse give u that
They can’t stand to see me winning so they blame Payola????🥵
BIG LATTO
disliked the video for latto cuse
Surprisingly, Yung Miami's verse was 🔥.  But, I think I low key became a fan when City Girls popped up in my workout mix a few months ago. Still can't get with Latto's rapping, but I do adore Latto the personality. 🤷🏽‍♀️
I love Young Miami Ctfu I feel like anything she say is hard and she is funny lmao
We love it when the rap girlies get together!❤
The biggest 🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
I love the remix too, but the right people have to be on this song .  Like... Lil'Kim with her hard core flow & spine chillin lyrics, foxy brown chyna doll style, dream doll, jackie o, cardi b, etc.  I can go on & on .  Y'all get the point . Bzzz... 🏰👸🐝 Sting...!!!
Latto said naaaan😴😴😴
Fun fun fun all the way. 😀😀😀😀
Can we count how many times Latto bent over ...I guess she had to claim that..since everybody was saying she was tryna be Ice spice
COME AWNNNNN VIDEO PRODUCTION
Been waiting since this morning for the video to come out ❤❤🔥🔥
Latto verse was trash asf should have got spice 😂
Yessss girlies 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣🗣🗣🗣

Y’all talking bout carshae man lotta snappp
Song is fire but wheres is JT. Like come on yall wrong for not putting JT on here. I mean Latto killed it.  young  Miami bid good but all she talk about is sex. WHERE IS JT she wound of murdered this remix
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wish Lola would have done a new verse and left Latto off. When has Latto ever been associated with Payola 😂🤣😂🤣
Latto kinda ate…but why use nicki bars? It’s giving FAN. She just needs to apologize.. KARESHA ATE THIS UP !
Lit 🔥

LOLAS GONA BE BIG BY THE END OTHE YEAR TRUST ME

Big Latto said she ain't Neva doing coke..and rumors was that nicki was high on coke a few weeks ago on her performance....Is that line a correlation or am I tripping?
Latto been working!
Miami ate that uppppp
I love this but i think Cardi B would've killed this even more..
Latto bars was lackluster. No shade wit it.

Bruh Lattos verse!🔥🔥🔥
