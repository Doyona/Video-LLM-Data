W
Bro makes KSI look small lol
Amazing 🔥
For Ironland
Can I join your team, am from Nigeria and I study civil engineer
Nice Stevewilldoit music
The floor was just time consuming... should a just bought a grey floor... simple
Ashville is the best 😍
So fqqqqqqqq
Ksi is just a screaming idiot, i dont find him interesting at all
Make sure to add extra caffeine into the cement mix like Prime poisoning our kids
More like scammed him
Built on bottles of fancy pop?
bruh's gonna burn some loud in this room layin down and naming his own constellations
Who?
Nice work! Put you could of centred the Legacy light properly on the wall ;)
Perfect !
LED lighting logo in a infloor diffuser would have really sent this off
Smashed it,  rooms on fire!!!!!!!
GOD JAB
Can u do something with BEARDMeatsFood?
I would have made the curtains as low as the floor line, so there won't be that glow from outside.
I want prime
Great work - but, I'm obessing over the AirCon unit being a weakpoint in all the amazing sound-proofing...  Is it quiet? If not can it be shut off when recording?
Hi Dan I was wondering if you could  find me some prime because I love him and how you have mentioned him in this weeks video.
By the way this is a sick Youtube creative room, need you to come and do my studio next!
Been follwoing you for a while and I just love your vibe, energy, clarity you bring, the anything is possible mindset. An amaziing contribution of growth and developement you ad to this platform, keep up the good work and long may you continue to inspire well beyond your spheres of influnce and reach.
my goodness the top layer has been achieved
😂
TBH I'm a little underwhelmed
What was the renovation cost to make this studio?
Does this guy even talk like a normal human ? How does he even talk without screeching, whoahing, hahahaha,,,yooooo…..aaaaarghhahaha….brooo…?
fucking sick
Forgot how loud and annoying KSI was😂
perfect video! KSI has earned it
Looks mega, but “the best YouTube creation room” is a big stretch 🤨
Is this the guy that does stuff for yannimize?
This is a banging fit-out!!
What is the name of the blue foam? which he uses for the panel ? 😇
The ceiling is amazing
Link for that lambhoghini wallpaper
sorry to say Ksi his pure idiot
Loved it! Well done. Loves KSI loves reaction x.
KSI just looking like 😂 in the intro. Well done ash! Glad you are still going x
Going to need longer curtains tbf
Do ishowspeed setup and give him a Green screen cause he uses it alot😂👌 Trust me that will be content!!!
15:04 Im an American and i found this shit so funny💀💀💀
Einfach Montes Schlafzimmer ist sogar besser.
GORGEOUS ROOM…..EXQUISITE TASTE #perfection
Wild🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Cool 😎😎😎😎
8.45 - man like Dave Chappelle offering his expertise!

Sidemen and acabatelo ninja kidz tv Las hashtags
Epic 👌
this room is cold!
Dead song
He still is and will only be a youtuber in my eyes, not a boxer.
This is next level! Amazing job.
Incredible fit-out Daniel! Complex planning makes for simple daily use.
I guess the British have a really low standard for the word "hard". Either that, or he just never made it to High School.
Jj should've let Asheville do and complete his setup video instead of kon. Then we would've had the video up by now. Kon is a joke and will do anything to postpone it. Probably getting 100 sponsors so he can make it into 20 parts and let us wait longer.
it is missing  a mini bar daniel
yeah only took u like 6 months
That 30k thank you
This is sick
When you're multi millionaire and they give you a 10m² room 😅
montes raum ist deutlich besser !
Come and go my room the same my granddaughter has autism and would love the optic roof please make this happen Ksi please
The greenscreen is a fail because he cant use it while sitting in front of his desktop its way to far away from it
A hidden fridge whould be awesome as well
hate to say it but for the amount of time this took its embarrassingly bland and bad.
The MAD sound change when he closes those acoustic curtains! The voice completely stops travelling like you're away from the whole world 😁
17:38 if ksi needs help to leav the rom. Blink 5 times fast... I i call the pigs. ..... :D
so good
jj put those grippers away
I would’ve made the panels screens - they’d look black so they’d fit better with the aesthetic and then you could have them show whatever you want
Ive never seen ksi using this room . Lol .
great work .... this should get 10m views eventually  ...
JJ Apartment looks like he goes to toilet using an elevator.
Made He's Day!
Hey Asheville Team :) - Please check my setup out. Always been inspired by your builds, soon will get my own .! https://youtu.be/CaclqCSdpsQ
Montes Zimmer ist besser
That’s that edit on the thumbnail
Great Job. All i would say is maybe a very slightly darker floor would have complemented the overall look better. Also rather than curtains you could have done better blackout with a blind system. You get that messy light spill when the curtains are drawn during the day at the bottom. Thats all really, good job
nothing compared to that arab guy aboflah's setup
Bro Ksi Mansion is Bigg tho...
Perfect Job !!!!!!!!!!!
who's here after JJ finally get his room?
Need those star lights in every room of my house😂😂
My turn 😀
Personally I would have liked the light from the outside not leak into room from the ground when the curtains are closed all the way. You can see it at 15:41 . I would have preferred to have an automatic sliding "door" that would absorb the natural light from outside after the curtains are closed. That would give me the choice if in a moment i would prefer some light getting into the room or not. After a while i am sure you'll notice the difference.
16:44 Well he was partially right
Bro did the maddest setup eva !
Pewdiepie got everybody working on their cable management 😂
I feel like jj lives in an apartment in London? Because his house seems to not have direct windows
Lol guys happy with this small room check aboflah setup
Came here after the reddit video.
Your editor done a great job at this, or I’m guessing kon done it ?
THIS IS MADNESS
An educated, well produced and intelligently commentated video 💪🏻
Ksi looks so tiny in front of dan
stop seying us
Ashville daub
Ashville
If you think you’re useless remember this guy Connor exists
The beginning looked like a parent’s evening😂😂😂
SICK
Incredible
this shit was beyond underwhelming lmfao
my dream room.
this is a madness looks dope
this looks actually dope bruh, love the starlight idea 🔥
uks what sorry that's mr bean
"All the 10 million plaqes... Yeah yeah,  How many you got? " jj - "Enough."
Needs a picture of KSImon for it to be complete
@ashville dub
Hope you do the same to FaZe Rug
yeah this is legit a dream office/setup, so excited for Kon to finish it up
Why has he not filmed in this yet
0:14 ksi looks like he is in a parents meeting
well done man. you came through different
the fact that the dude in the begining is 10 times bigger ksi makes me scared
What if you had tinted glass? Full privacy even with natural light coming in
Did you build a recovery room for when jake Paul knocks him out? 😂
this looks like straight garbage, just saying
When is he gonna film in this room ?
Privacy glass
Those men are some serious masters of their work. Great respect for them.
I love these renovation videos
The presenter guy is so well spoken, I'd take a speaking course from him
Is it possible to make the ceeling from OLED panels?
11:31 Polish contractors are the best !!
"The best youtube creation room"  Awww
This is technically what I'm doing in college. I'm doing carpentry and this is ultimately what it can lead to.
You know he’s about to fuck in that room …constantly
Once Kon slaps together the desk setup oh my god the videos...
ksi voice is annoying
"lamborghini wallpaper" made in belgium for half the price 🤣
Now this is a type of art, loved this concept of video!🙏
14:46 bro was on a world tour😂
Big shout out to the craftsmen who do all the heavy lifting. These boys sacrifice their bodies to provide a better life for their families and don't get the credit they deserve nearly often enough!
Fernandinho doing bits with his new career switch
That’s a lovely job guys when done. Am guessing there wasn’t  much change left for 20k 🤣
15:37 dude……this vibe is insane
"Put me back in America... AHHH THERES SHOOTINGS" that one line made the whole video🤣🤣🤣☠️ low key he ain't wrong.
such a sick videoo and a room! did a great job the room is a whole vibe 🔥
why does jj plaque say Konstantin
Wow 🤩
he's gonna make that his new music studio
nothing comes close to AboFlah's Setup (bro got a whole spaceship)
Ashville W
for the pc setup, what if the table has dragon ball themed finishing?
Hey Ashville, i'd love to know, what you think of the Setup that Montana Black has. He is a German YouTuber and Streamer
I thought kon was meant to do this
This is actually sick!
That room must be roasting
greenscreen contests are pre cool
how did this idiot become one of the richest people in the uk
wtf even is this guy?
"UK's biggest YouTuber"  PewDiePie: OK maybe I'll just go then :(
ahahhahahaah
Unreal! but no mention on where or what you have done with the smoke alarm that is linked to the rest of the property that was in that room initially?
this is soooo sick
okey guys forget the room look at the rest of that houseeee damnnn its big
So cold man. Fair play Ashville, you niced our boy
Amazing video, subscribed and cant wait for Simons set up 2.
It didn't look that good tbh
Even I wanted to see the desk and setup, but this is sick
When designing the next room, if you decide to put a star ceiling, maybe consider making a curved ceiling, it might make it look more realistic. Just an idea which could possibly work
A couch
Such a brilliant room then will be ruined by Kons mediocre setup, all he does is buys loads of gear and plugs it in no proper craftsmanship involved. I know he's a friend of the sidemen but Jesus I'd get someone else to do it.
The other sidemen be like after Kon made JJ’s room/setup a step up from all the other sidemen. 💀💀💀
Kinda mid.
Ashville and Konstantin should film a house tour of KSI's new house
People don’t understand how good these mfks are at remodeling
ngl.. the room is mid.. I've seen way way smaller youtubers with much better rooms
Bro I thought @2:06 that it was a window to the outside ITS THE INSIDE OF HIS HOUSE
Amazing video
amazing video this!
morpheus would have approved rip little guy 🙏
Does this guy talk quietly or am I just used to JJ talking loudly? Love the video, by the way, you never fail to disappoint!!!
Mid
JJ tried sooooooooooooooo hard to make this a good video 🤣 I'ts cool but like we've all seen much nicer than this all over youtube, Also dude was kinda cringe
Somewhat underwhelming and tacky - it looks like it has been modelled on a premises that would be found in the Red Light district of Amsterdam. I have never seen fibre optics before being butchered and handed so amateurishly, that needs to be put right. The floor however is top notch quality.
DAL and KSI  rock on bro you really smashed it here,, respect to you both
Asheville did amazing job with the room
hi
This is a great setup well suited and aesthetic for JJ, but there's an extreme setup out there that beats all, just search aboflah setup and you will see.  Very happy for you JJ
People with these kinds of jobs genuinely impress me. Electricians, plumbers, those kinds of jobs
a subwoofer ??
I love that this video has surpassed 2M views, on to 3M and further!
Its a pretty cool office.
i live in Asheville. No like actually. I live in Asheville North Carolina. No joke.
i think MontanaBlack's room is pretty sick
Daniel you should make that a new Business Asheville set ups. Where you build YouTubers set ups
I am not sure if you put it in, but I would put in "Macro" lighswitch buttons for diffrent moods.  Like full turn off lights and only stars with one button and more. This room looks fire tho, sheeeesh
If there's anything I want in life...is to have an office space like that. Could tell straight away how much of an impact those curtains had on dampening the room sound just by how much less reverb was in the recording after they had closed. One little thing I'd change would be to have the curtains altered in length to stop the light bleeding through once they're closed.
Should’ve added a subwoofer
KSI he is freaking savage
Room was insane but the video was underwhelming bc of the early reveal, you need to tell not show until we get a full reveal with ksi. Build up the hype with the next room transformation
all this for him to record another reddit video lmao
This is fucking insane bro.
There’s AC right because with all that padding it’s no different then installation
so yea coming to the bill its $100,000
can i ask what ceiling speakers were installed?
If I see "Activate Windows" in the next video
Bro when I jj going to do a house tour that penthouse looks absolutely massssive bro
Who is responsible for the panel boards?
Brilliant job. Fantastic collab with Daniel and Kon. Looks awesome. Shout out Ashville.
im so happy to see jj this happy hes finally made it from fifa content in an old bedroom to now fliming in a full on studio filled with Lamborghini stuff and greens screens hes really made it
Major Dub
Mid
some AI features would do nicely
I’m sorry, nobody will beat nick mercs set up. I had to say it!
ashville dub
Hope KSI can activate his windows now.
tbh mini bar/mini fridge and ........................................................................................................................................ me
he looks so small in the intro😭😭
Thats sick 💯
I thought it said Logang for a sec
maybe a temperature system would’ve been excellent but SICKKK
yooo i wonder how much that cost. besides the expensive materials etc
You could of add something to do with boxing.
i was like dont show fucking spoilers is it only me
How is this guy not at 1 million subs?
Bet he charged about 40k for that rip off
built in fridge ?
This is dope already subbed 🔥🔥
I Challenge You to Box KSI, My Name is Satveer  Singh from Sacramento CA I'm 6ft 200lbs
yes mate i can think of some shit that you could add, A FUCKING DESK 💀💀💀
one thing i’ve got to say somthin on is the stars in the ceiling, that’s not really fiber optic cable it’s more just string lights
If I get famous enough I will text you guys, and if you can see me I'll wait up too 6 years to get your guy attention I hope I can get you guys to help me in the future this is the first video I see from you guys I hope I get noticed enough for you guys to notice me
Bruh what is that thumbnail
I'm happy for him and jealous as hell at the same time lol
Washville x Wsi
and already had to Photoshop his reaction in the thumbnail
This room is goals forsure! I think the only thing I would add would be some very slight tint on those big windows just but other than that you guys did an amazing job!
Regardless of how the room turned out...I really appreciate how he explained what they were doing and why they were doing it.
i wish u could do my room
I want them star lights above my bed to get me to sleep
JJs house looks like a hotel.
Stunning . That is one Pro Job .
I can edit
I miss ksi
Ashville should make more videos like this, around the 20 minute mark. His videos are interesting but no one has to time to watch 1 hours worth of it a day. If he makes videos like this, not only will he get loads of views but the video's will be much more interesting.
pov ksi continues to film in bedroom
Green screen way too far back imo
This would be a sick studio
Arse ville
Space for belts may be good shout
The views even YouTube loves it ❤️
Replace the starlights with frameless screens so you can project a  real life galaxy / or anything of choice
This is insane 🔥🔥
This is the setup ksi deserves!
9:20 i thought that was andrew tate
0:50 That face tho Looks like an upcoming serial killer 💀 🤣   If you didn’t find it  Look at JJ
this nigga said ahh the shootings. fuck man
Awesomeeee
of course he will play not over yet xD
So sick. Big W
This is Sick !
hi  deez
This guy has the perfect voice for radio, so soothing
sick
Damn bro, I can’t believe u made that entire set up in 10minutes and 41 seconds. I might need to hire u
Ww
Try not to laugh 😭😂😂😂
THIS IS FUCKING INSANE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Incredible
Electrostatic glass so that with a press of a button the glass would become opaque with light sill coming through, this would have added another layer of depth into the room when the curtains aren't closed. I think this still could be added but may take a while to plan.
If we trade rooms i can teach you to say mural
Am I the only one that thinks this room is just an overpriced rectangle? I think they could’ve done ALOT more to the room, and I think it should’ve been much bigger too. But that’s just me..
I would add a space in the wall, for some new hamsters :)
Learned a lot of little cool tips watching your work, I’m Definitely going to implement them in my craft, very good work!
What about actual lighting?! Yeah star ceiling is cool and all but I think you forgot to put actual lighting that is absolutely necessary for shooting videos.
yo this is sick! GG Ashville GG JJ well It would be sick if you could get your hand on Miniminters Office!
stay watching, crazy room
best video yet
Damnn nice job!
meh .. over reaction
Gang
Best youtuber creation room?? Haven’t you seen Montanablack
Secret door
You already know he is filming a reddit vid
Mr bean is a bigger youtube channel
Who’s ksi
Put me back in America. Ahh the shootings. 😂💀
ashville dubbbbb cant wait to see the plaque fitting
you missed vr
U could have put a built in mini fridge in other than that it’s perfect
The “sup” and giggle at the start was jokes😂
Wow the amount of work this took is insane, looks crazy🔥
Just popped up on my recommended, amazing video
Finally found his channel after he's been all over my TikTok
my setup
this guy bouta make a shit tone of money
Fantastic workmanship
W
This is an incredible base to make the ultimate setup. I just upgraded my desk setup too (On a much smaller scale) and the difference it makes is incredible. You are excited and motivated to work on it everyday and productivity goes through the roof!  We already know the main wall gonna have an adjustable standing desk with 3 monitors. I hope he gets some sick Recording and DJ equipment too on the lamborghini wall side making it like an L shaped desk. The Ultimate lounge/gaming/youtube/streaming/music recording setup!!
ayo what’s wrong with ksi in the thumbnail
I thought KSI was rich why he still living in the slums? Why doesn’t he get a house with some land???
Great work bro, skilled men at work 💯💯
Bro went America and said 'Ahh the shootings' and went back to home😭😭
He can also do podcast with a couch on the Lamborghini wall
without the desk, it seems half done.
this room is dark tho. i like ksi videos in a light background
Dub big time
i tought this would be all con and on con's channel. i guess con thought this is for KSI so it has to be amazing
Can’t imagine how much the bill was for that would be! And when the star light fail that’s gonna be a pin in the arse to fix!!
insane
Proof money can buy happiness
bro makes jj look small
Yooo ! Amazing job guys ! The "lambo" wall the door hiden with the all wall made by that guy its just insane ! The floor , stars, every detail ... You guys naild it ! Love everything  about that room .. Small ,cozy ...Very welcoming vibey room !
So dark tho
Idea to add if you can is: KSI writen in stars
love the tik toks. made me come here and i love this too. good work mate
Next video: We helped JJ activate his Windows!
yes he need an office for such important work
Green screen moving slow
Sheeeeeeeeesshhhhh
Ashville Dub
19.48 / 19.49/ 19.50 one  thing add one KSI love his boxing belt put into glass collecttors cabinets
Exxcceelllleeenntttttt work Ashville :)
ill the  say something  what if the legacy thing could change colours
Ashville is an oreo smiling kneego
Whats the song called that he played?
Shoulda added some moving LEDs in the ceiling to mimic shooting stars that would’ve been cold
Ashville W
wow this mustave cost a small fortune
bros soul when ksi said properly try not to laugh
warm spotlights above the pc setup or above the plagues would look even more dope
Only thing I would’ve wanted is a wavy fish tank
Did he get this for free or he payed?
Epic 👍💫😎
he speaks so clearly but its so intimidating
It’s a completely different room when the curtains are closed
so beautiful
Soooo amazing    Great work out there... Loved ashville since day 1 on my other account
So let me get this straight you guys built a room for KSI who is a already a millionaire but not for any one else who might actually need help in building a room? Bit confused but maybe it's for advertising purposes.
You built a nobody a office and everyone is excited lol it’s a guy who sits and screams at a pc screen and this is major news 🙄🙄😂😂😂 2 talentless melts literally grooming each other lol look at them nobody cares you pair of Pratt’s lol
I won’t lie I thought it was mid
That’s super hard man
that is sick
Happy for him. He deserves it!
you alreaaaadyyy knoowww how cold this is gunna look
When’s the kon vid out?
That’s sick 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just missing the bed in the background but great stuff!
SO SIMPLE YET SO MUCH DONE
isnt fibre optic cable kind of dangerous to look at when light passes through it? maybe not the best choice of material for the ceiling.
Cash in hand fella got the blur job
Y'all did amazing !!
My guy is huge...
that is the absolute dumbest and slowest way of sanding and staining a floor, been a floorman for 8yrs and ive never seen it done like that
cleannn
Happy for JJ won both fights and gets a massive room makeover this makes me happy
The green screen was slow as fuck I’d die
This man talks so beautifully
Couldve added a lil beerus (bear) Easter egg on the led light.
Time to do Behz and Harry’s room
What’s the song 12:16
U can sense his excitement and curiosity through his voice 👍
The curtains could be a little longer on the drop! Light coming through the bottom.
So JJ approved it before u even did it... That kind of spoils the surprise, its meant to be a big surprise thing that they don't know about until its complete, rather than asking him about absolutely everything
The star roof is mad, especially when he switched the colors.
If you see KSI old set up and how much he was able to do with it. I really wanna see his new set up but Kon just don't wanna show
An arsenal prime shirt in a frame
Why does the thumbnail look like that?
Ashville Dub
The only time I’ve ever felt jealous of an office
Jj now has his own autism sensory chamber
KSI should box this guy
Ninja is cooler
Hahahaha bruv, you've fallen into the influencer trap. Ksi is in a different league. Why you acting like a fan girl. You bitch 😂
the star lights are just such a vibe
Love how jj smiles when he calls him “uks biggest YouTuber”
How much did this cost 😳
I'd love to see KSI do some gaming videos on  some scary games 🤣 or some other games.
It looks amazing  imagine a dream gaming/music studio setup video from kons channel
This is too dope! Fr! Can the Legacy sign change color?
It’s not that great . Probably a good podcast room. That’s the feel I get from it. Great room none the less
The room is so small lol. But looks nice
This like the “pimp my ride” for rooms, “pimp my room” 😂😂😂, but real shi, this looks wavyyy
You know you guys can install Philips hue lighting and sync them with the Streamdeck via Corsair iCUE (Corsair owns Elgato) because Corsair has a partnership with Philips also iCUE can also sync the PC case lighting and Corsair's own brand of gaming peripherals such as keyboards mice and headsets etc... I do this in my home and its awesome to have everything under control from one application and they even have features such as game integrations for the RGB lighting as in when playing games colours appearing on screen show in the lighting such as having blue and white lighting when looking in the sky to symbolise sky and clouds etc... and also it can be used for monitoring health of the character you are controlling and other cool stuff Give Corsair a shout and you will be surprised especially since they currently have no major partnerships with many of the bigger UK youtubers and streamers and is a brand only popular in the USA and  I live in the UK and I use their stuff. I am only saying this because I hate it when I have to use so many multiple means of controlling different items when they can be done in one go with one software that can also be used to customise the keyboard shortcuts and macros and Elgato Streamdeck controls and even be able to control the Corsair gaming monitors via software so you can literally control your monitor with a Streamdeck or a Corsair keyboard or something
Have you seen aboflah step up  its 100x better than yours
get the sidemen to qpr ;)
3:27 foam runners 2.0 🤪
Holy moly 😶
We can all agree, he never disappoints with his content 😁
Don't know how long this build took but it should be a 5 day max job
the editing on this vid is top tier
I can already see the channel "Kashville Kustoms" oor sumtin liek that
Common
Its very cool, but you could argue if its the best room of a YouTube/Twitch star from Germany, montanablack is his name. He has a bedroom also with this stars as light and a gamingroom looking MAD. But this is so fire man, fuckin hard
Man did konstatin Dirty
Ashville dub
how big is his house holylyyy
tinted windows imo
There using the stevewilldoit intro 😂
MO JJ editor. He really deserve amazing office too.
Ksi vs ashville boxing match?
can the fatneek have a nice set up now
a sculpture of KSI in the corner
Absolute Madness 🔥🥶
Fat ethans back
Look at montanablacks haha his is Crazy
i love the room and good job from everyone and the green screen is cool and auto curtains so it makes a diffrent feeling
2:07 broooo....
I don't want to be disrespectful but the best YouTube room is owned by the YouTuber Thegref , go check his abitacion del tiempo maked by redbull company
Miniminter is building a house so like maybe you can reach out to him and nice him👀
@konstantainian
we gave a guy with infinite money something he could have wanted without us
What’s up with the uncanny thumbnail
this video just made me happy
Dude at 17:15 i just hope green screen can come into use Whole r/ksi: oh it will
2:57 Why does this shot look like DIY SOS where KSI is a disabled wheelchair user in desperate need of an accessible home renovation…
Not gunna lie its not great/amazing... but not a lot of room to work with.
super cool room but definetely not "the best youtuber room" bro forgot about nickmercs and that other guy who is spanish or something
Christ KSI is annoying
office like this for a try not to laugh... its JJ alright
Thank you for labeling the sections.
That legacy could have been so much better
terrible video
This was sick -!
Nick mercs room is sick
Can I get one please :')
Yo Jj we need a house tour… like back in the old sidemen house… mostly you won’t do it but the house looks crazy
He def. needs to play a horror game in this room, the vibe would be INSANE
Someone need to react to this
can the legacy change color?
I’m happy for you ksi 🤙🏽🤙🏽
Reddit gonna talk about how JJ looks smaller then Ashville bro. 🫣
Seeing jj hyped and happy makes happy too 😂
JJ gonna smash in that room... I said it
mannnnn this is gasssss
3:05 I thought Ksi was in a wheelchair 😭
Stevewilldoit intro music 😂
do coryxkenshin next'
Why is ashville even involved in this? is the room being made of concrete lol
Great great great room build 💯
Wouldn’t mind you doing my tattoo / art studio but man’s not got the budget 😂😂😂 love the work though constant class!
Kon is so underated and talented, but has the worst luck on holidays🥲
Worth the wait. Big up, Ashville and Kon!
beautiful
2:06  just have a look at that angle  and imagine how mad the rest of his house is
New memes will be born here 😂
respect to the camera operator for some really good shots there
How will this affect LeBron's legacy?
It’s crazy, once the curtains closed, the whole vibe changed and the sound did, as well !
Damn
I could argue that Aboflah's new setup is better than this but don't get me wrong Ksi's new setup is sick
Take a shot every time he says "fabric" lmaoo   (One of the best designs and execution I've seen to date btw, loved it)
And people say money don't buy happiness
Is it just me or I’m wondering where tf is his desk💀
The strandman’s new office ☑️☑️☑️
Do the setup of actual biggest creator of UK ... Vikkstar123 🐐
Do Vikkstar123 room
What’s the name of the song at the end
Oh that wallpaper is good for an office, maybe i'll shortlist *Sees lamborghini logo ... Nevermind
You got a new sub right here 😁
Ninja room
YOUCHEWBAH
I mean u didn’t add a bean bag those are always needed.
Wow that’s crazy how the audio became so much more crisp after they closed those curtains
16:44 the silence there was so loud
add a fish tank in the wall
Ash Dubs
so no one is gonna talk abt ksis facetuned nose in the thumbnail
14:56 finally I know who's in Paris
Man closed the door and said u ain't going nowhere fam
The fact bro asked what the first thing JJ was gonna film in there and this mf said “probably a try not to laugh” had me dying😭
Bro how big is this guy ksi looks like his kid😂
only thing that would make it cooler would have been those projection mapped holograms that you see sometimes at NFL NBA NHL games, where the floor looks like it can fall away and stuff. really pointless but cool still hahaha
Should have add Simon’s face some where
The SteveWillDoIt music killed me 😂 looks nice though guys!!
a Simon life size card board cut out
Personally, I like how the room was before but that’s just me tho 🤷‍♂️
Is this in his flat? Or does he have a house now
who’s house is this his?
the star light is sick
High key top two setups I've ever seen in my life down like that is going to hit fucking so different on them speakers
This guy's actually sick at his job
Nah this room is perfect
Really liked the commentary and analysis of the design and construction process from start to finish.
stripper Pole missing
W
wow
Awesome setup! Just needs a mini fridge for his Prime drinks :-)
That's actually incredible what u done in there that was definitely worth it jj was so happy with the end result
Hearing Stevewilldoit’s intro song threw me off 💀
Imagine one say u get called into work to plaster a wall and u just walk into JJs house
you couldve added a desk….
An inwall subwoofer
Hey Ashville! Whenever you have the time, see the work that RedBull did on this Spanish YouTuber called "TheGrefg" and his office. It’s something really incredible. And I think a person like you would appreciate the work…
Ashville W
Someone get PewDiePie to react to this 🔥
i actually cant see what is soo amazing he's literally put on panels and starlight roofing that's basically it
This is a dream room for any one! I want my room to look like this 😭🔥👀🖤
Daniel would destroy in the youtube boxing, only issue is he doesnt have the time to train for it, but it would be easy for him
Yooo!! That looks madd!! I’ll be editing in there all day. Such a vibe!
Can we take a second to realise how nice ksis house is omg
You know what’s funny. The idea of the green screen coming down from the ceiling, they probably got that idea from castro1021. Great fucking idea I love it.
The guy with ductape in background has 0 respect 😀
I see why my wifi is still using copper wiring all the fibers are in his ceiling
Just need a mini fridge
Ngl montanablack has an even cooler youtube/twitch creater room
Wonder how much those 2 guys got paid
The grey pads on the door is 🔥😂
Awesome work, it looks sick! 🔥
I know that there is a website that uses your birthday to map the stars in the night sky wonder if you guys used that or not
Is it me or the green screen is too far? or the desk smaller in my head
uks biggest? mr bean
Id like it more with carpettttt, cmon missed opportunity 😢
Job well done
my man said he gonna do a try not to laugh 💀💀
12:08 BABATUNDE HAS RETURNED (not trying to be racist, I only thought of that cause he didn’t have shoes on)
I would of added in a silent mini-fridge under where the air con unit is. It could have been filled with prime.
JJ deffo smashing in there
ez bag for them
jj x ash is something that i would have loved to see in the back of my mind but to actually see it is absolutely amazing!
Has he ever seen Nick Mark's room?
hello
regardless of how you made this for i think that the craftsmenship and explaining is perfect. i used to do a bit of carpentry and brick laying so i think your design is nice

Didn’t anybody think JJ’s house looks like an apartment building?
Dark wood flooring
Ashville = W

Class job. Well presented too.

Great 👍 job guys.
F ME !!!!  THIS IS MY LATEST DREAM OF WANTING TO DO! after i heled sensei cj ive been wanting to do things like this ;o im soooooo inspired i hope to meet you one day with stories to share and set ups to show off. amazing work!!
Unfortunately he forgot to add the KSImon pictures from his bedroom, JJ will probably add them in his own time
The level of the finishes here are shockingly amazing 👍
This is how RR makes their ceilings
Jj gotta stream warzone bro
👍
@castro1021 needs to see some of this
This is a place to sleep man, working here would make me sleepy 5 minutes in
This is dope af. That ceiling is amazing. I need it.
nice work
This is amazing!!! 😍😍. I wish I had money to re do my room 😂.
14:10 missing the "as much".  Only thing missing are some wall-lights to compliment the stars better.
Bro I literally cried watching this video, what you guys do it’s on another level.
Nice installation
i would add ac but its ok
add a stripper pole
add floor heating :P
i wish i had a room like that 💯💯💯
Only thing I would of put differently is I would of had them windows that tint electronically they would of been sick !
Y'all are phenomenal artists
I love the music in this video
Kinda small not gunna lie. Expected more from KSI house.
I’m so exited to see this spot in his videos. My goal is one day I’m gonna have an office like this. And I’ll hire you guys to make it. Super impressive.
I know what I'm saving up for👀
u have to fix impulsive's set
Office without a table. How sick it can be
I put those stars in my car i love them
Room looks great, if you guys want to see a sick YouTubers room, have a look at nickmerks!! That’s mental
I wonder what Reddit has already put in that green screen
hope you dont put him sat with his back to the door man, he should be facing the door.
ashville dub
nahhh yall went crazy , this a dream office fasho
I cant wait for Moe to abuse JJ with that green screen.
ashville W well done guys
TTA
I like how he is saying "We We We" and he Is nowhere to be found. Great work tho
Ngl the glimpse of the rest of the house looks sick
I know Simon and Talia are going to move to a new house... maybe they need two new youtube/stream rooms?
Bruh probably spent hella racks for this room 😂😂
"To show KC, To show JJ" nice save
yah this room sucks it didn’t have an elevator going to a underground arcade and bowling area soooo…
hyped for him to paint himself green
Gotta say the best has still MontanaBlack88
What a transformation for reals. Looks great.
Man’s house is a fkn madness
kinda sus that guy has his face blurred out
PC??????
You put legacy on a wall, great office
SteveWillDoIt intro song? Good choice
Don’t play it’s not over yet cos it will get copyrighted
Hard work pays off]
How much did it cost bruh
Who else heard the Steve will do it intro music
Had to subscribe:) It’s really interesting to listen to how you explain things!
15:00 dark humor at its finest😂😂😂
god i wish i was rich
Check @abo flah room it’s the best in the whole world
My dudes finally got a room!!! Will be weird not seeing the back of his TV but im hyped for the new stuff!!
Striper pole
“Ahhh there’s shootings” 😂😂😂😂😭 that’s America all right
It’s very interesting seeing how construction is on the other side of the world
Cool seeing how much work and detail they went into.
Ashville W
Very Nice 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is his office in spiderman mansion?
You deserve some Platinum
ASHVILLE W
would be nice if the lights were synced to music
is it just me or u have the feeling to smell the paint
😂😂😂😂he said north Korea nah get me out of here America ahhh there’s shootings😂😂😂😂
yo ksi looks so awkward in the intro, JJ be hyped, get hyper you should of told him that
That clip of JJ switching between countries was pure gold 🤌
That clip of JJ switching between countries was pure gold 👌
I love the look but didn't this take like a month or two at least? What took so long a week of work could of down this with all the materials and plans that's also pushing it to.
me
Dude. That house looks massive
Bro it's sick but where is the ac???
That room is off the charts.....Especially that drop down screen, the lambo wallpaper and those fibre optics.... all that...Nutz bro
So awesome He deserved it! His Journey continues…..🙏🏻
Just wanna be a millionaire to make some buildings and Give this guys to design it .
daaaamn....     almost as cool as my room
Now we just need Kon to finish it up
I think they should make an impulsive  studio setup, that would be dope as fuck
Now kon needs to do something
The acoustics on the audio when those curtains closed was phenomenal and so apparent holy crap you guys are good
part 2?
Ksi in a new video be like : I’m currently in viks basement 😐
Awesome guys
Three months and he moving out from this office
overrated
Asheville: this is the best room that a creator has        ninja : am I a joke to you?
t
It looks normal and underwhelming
2:06 THE FUCKING HOUSE HAS A BRIDGE FAM 💀💀
The panneling gave me extreme pleasure
Naa tho much much did it cost?
The stars feature look amazing and so realistic i can tell jj loves this
Ashville W
Top g>>>ksi
sick '
Kon always concerned about cables always has me cracking up 😂😂
Big play my guy 👌🏻
Aboflah’s setup is still far Superior don’t get me wrong this is great. You did a great job 👏🏿👏🏿
The only thing that I would've liked to also have fit is spotlights that change colour with the music. Would've been like a rave cave as well then.
Optic cable guy is legend
Bro stole kon's vid😂😂
This looks fire, wish deji gets his upgraded as celebration to his win too !
So was this free or what? Rich people usually get things for free.
gotta love when a fat man tries to seem big XD
Why does he look like a hostage at the beginning of the video lmao
Und wir haben unser Studio nach 3 Monaten immer noch nicht fertig
This is very entertaining to watch, great video❤
im just imagine pewdiepie being like hold my gfuel   and then you got mr beast like hold my mr beast burger
Hands down one of the best, if you aren't subscribed wyd with your life.
imagine being so rich you don't even decide what renovations you make to your house😂
That green screen set up is next level, the possibilities are endless fr
Ash was a bit serious in the opening, you could tell jj wanted to make a joke then looked at ash 🤨
Awesome room, so proud of JJ
Ashville W
meanwhile xQc....
Me an Electrician "heh doesnt look too hard i could do that" me at the end "eh maybe not :D"
W Manz
A bit of seatback here 😬 wouldnt it been cool if u could just push the door and it wouldve popped open from the inside and on the outside a secret bottun.
Ashville W
Never seen JJ look so small next to someone 😄
JJ is gonna scream like a MAD MAN🤣
looks Magnificent!
Crazyyy
Music selection is top class, video is well done. Overall great job lad!
Wow, 1 mil views in like 5 days  Thats a first
good to show everything in the intro on how everything looks after
So good. That’s all I can say😂
4:30 - RIP Stevewilldoit
It needs a mini fridge for cold bevvys that’s about it
you guys did amazing !
instead of the legacy you could've put KSI other then that great room loved it.
Man said “America, ahhh there’s shootings get me out of here”😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I know the focus is the setup but man's house looks insane from the window you can see through
Instant sub
Do miniminter's room in his new house
The room's amazing, you guys did an amazing job. My suggestion for thing you could have added would be multiple camera angles (back cam or  sealing cam) and maybe some sort of countdown timer somewhere. I have been hyped to see how this room would look and i can say i haven't been disappointed, cant wait to see the final setup after Kon is done.
Imma sub to con just so i can see how he made the other guys room
Oh shi- this was posted 5 days ago wow i gotta sub to this man first time seeing him
you need to make a setup for speed man
Tbh I would love to fall asleep in that room
JJ should be a one piece villain, with his weird laughter which is like a major requirement for most One Piece Villain
Jheez
And u still think money can't buy happiness?
Look better when Kon's done with it.
Reddit gonna have fun with this green screen :)
It gonna be weird seeing jj post and not see his bed in the background as this is the first time he might record and it not being in his bedroom (I’ve been watching him since 2012)
This guy has got a hotel for a house tf
Money does buy happiness and the room is nuts, great job guys!
josh is crying atm from when he designed his room 5 years ago
Imagine this dude and BIG STEVE as the sidemens bodyguard.
I sit the same way ksi was sitting in beginning aside my father  when  collecting my report card in college
I can’t wait for his setup cuss when it’s finished I really hope we will play more horror games and regular let’s plays
I have a lamborghini wallpaper on one or my walls for 3 years now. It holds and look great, I recommend it
We need more of these videos Dan! Another quality video!
3:16 Them creps are mad bro
Minter React To this
Lets just get one thing clear. KSI IS NOT A RAPPER
That is sick  but for the best room in youtube history is going for AboFlah  sorry JJ
Prefer Kons setups
Very mid
really really like the rolls royce night sky that looks EPIC!
my man makes JJ look so small😂😂😂
you have a very boring voice no offence
That Lamborghini wallpaper is really nice! What makes it lambo just the print? And I liked the details in the build just the little things add up
Maybe a 360 camera that drops down from the ceiling so you can film anything happening in the room at another angle and make some cool short form content
This room is amazing,imagine if Konstantin and Ashville made setups and rooms together
this is sick🔥 wish my setup looked this nice lol
imagine listening to an album for the first time just lying on the floor looking at the starlight ceiling
Steve Steve Steve Steve
the rest of the sidemen
Yo the next reddit vid is gonna be mad.
For people who doesn't know much about painting and decorating there's an code 'Ral' or 'BS' it's used to match certain branded paints with colours. IE. Ral is used for Dulux/Albany and BS is used for the higher paints such as f&B or little green
I feel like you could change the windows to electrochromic class so if JJ would like some natural light in but keeping the privacy, he could do that.
colddddddddd
The way he speaks is so relaxing
Tyron Woodley is surprisingly good in room makeovers
Awesome Daniel, you and your crew have delivered above and beyond what was required and that's down to your creative vision . KSI is one lucky chap!
MANS IS NOT PLAYING AROUND!!!
How long did it take to do the finer optics?
Could have added a stripper pole
Cant wait to watch reddit videos in that room
You deserve this G
lit
Crazy❤ Such a vibe❤🔥
mad
Why does Konstantin look like the old ethan
14:59 😂”nahh get me outta here”
looks cool but rooms kinda tiny ngl
I mean its just a room, other than the green screen its really not that youtube oriented, ive seen way better from much much smaller creators
GG!
Legacy was a very nice touch
Reminds me of yiannimize
you have to do pewdiepie now lol
Can’t wait for him to actually start earning money from YouTube I know he doesn’t need it really but still
Fair Play. Kon now finish the Setup quick.♥️
I’m kinda jealous but happy for them and I can’t wait to become a YouTuber one day and get like every YouTuber I look up too
“Put me back in umm.. America! Ahhh the shootings”😭🤣
JJ with the Natural Scooby doo laugh in the Intro
“North Korea, nah I don’t wanna be here get me out of here” had me dead 😂
With that green screen KSI can now be inside a try not to laugh video 😵‍💫
You already know h ain gonna use this though
14:27 i feel like that could be a meme
cant wait to see KSI making vids in that room
14:42 the ideas are flowing
JJ house is Diddy type large
i hope this becomes a whole series for different ytbers
Ksi has been planting all those years, now he is harvesting
bro i LOVE the stars
2:07 my guy has an atrium in his house wtf lmao
Unbelievable!! He deserves it!
JJ looks like a little man next to u lol
The amount of detail put into this setup is mentallll
Man’s living in gta
My dream
I unsubscribed to Kon and now to you
a flippin fish tank would be sick
Ksi is so awkward
bro this is sick but its noting compared to abo falah setup go check itout itfeels like a space ship
Ashville W
I ain’t gonna lie that shit looks bare/generic and dead af
great video, but ewhy does he sound like he is trying not to wake up jj when he is explaining what the upgrades will be
This is the breaking point ashville. You'll only climb higher from here!
You should add 3  square holes into the walls with lights were jj can put his diamond play buttons
Ive never seen jj so gassed
Simon's house next
Back ground music got me thinking about Stevewilldoit
Ksi is living life and all thanks to YouTube damn anything is possible
Where’s the fridge at ?
8:37 fernandinho lowkey came to set up JJ's office
Imagine their pay checks 😳
How big is that mansion?
😮😊
a bathtub
this is a great video! 😄
I just wonder how much all of this costs
this really is sick
Ashville Dub!
Ksi looks so small beside him
No hate this setup is lit but aboflah setup  is a littleraly a space ship
minifridge or fridge fitted in the wall would've been a nice addition, other than that the room is pretty solid.
My man look like KSI's uncle
Goals
Who the fuck dreams about a new office
No such curtains lol
Did nobody else notice Daniel accidentally popping out the access panel to the AC unit with his hench shoulder? 17:21  Joking aside this looks awesome. Looking forward to Kon's desk setup next.
thanks simon!!!
its realky good but its not the best  u should see abofakahs room its insane and its the best content creator room in thd world
Things you could’ve added- •Anything sidemen + Prime🤙 •Maybe a hint of boxing like how you did with the Lamborghini wrap •Could’ve put something that said KSI🤔 Not all of these need to go in there but maybe one or 2 could’ve fit for the aesthetic of the room but I understand it’s his space for creating, but those are some things he helped create a platform for otherwise what a fucking AWESOME room honestly🤙
Big up Daniel Big Up Ashville
maybe this is weird to say but i felt kind of emotional seeing JJ react to his new office considering since he started YouTube he's never really had one of his own before. The man has come a long way. Great job Ashville, class work!
Anyone know the song they played when they showed to room to JJ for the first time?
My only worry (there’s probably an easy explanation I’m missing) but won’t the LED’s run out or are they constantly connected to a power source because if it’s just a battery wouldn’t you need to take the roof off to fix it
Didn't realise how tricky star studded ceilings were
A couch
i love this thanks for making for jj
WWWWWWWWW
JJ looks so small sitting down.
Common Ashville W
KSI is playing gat v un real life, love it ahahahhhaah
Ashville Dub
Yooo that room is incredible!!
damn this guy running a room makeover like a heist setup
This is my dream room😭oh my god can't explain how much I love it
🥰🥰😘😘❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My only suggestion is to add Knowledge Strength and Integrity somewhere in the room
Has Kon just given up lol
dan tdm has more subs
Banger room guys, gotta commend you for work and time. Always love JJ's reactions
A fridge with prime in it is missing
AMAZING WORK
Should've created a Display case for the Beerus Chain. Otherwise the room looks insane
holy crap this is sick
This video alone is inspirational Fam 🥲
You need to do Vikstars room as well !  He’s due a setup makeover and with something like this in his new place, it’s gonna be absolutely insane 🔥
this giving castro room vibes :)
you should put 3 more neon signs with knowledge,  strength and integrity
ashville dub
aybe you could do YoungFilly's or anyone from their group if you haven't yet. OR MAYBE KSI's editor's office? I think he deserves a reward.  Maybe show us your office?
I think you should  of put a mini fridge  of PRIME
Time for Kon to do his magic.
As a kid I had a friend who had the star ceiling and when I saw this I knew immediately that it was still my dream to have it myself someday
Money well spent mate!!
And now he's taking a break so we gotta wait to see it in his videos.
This gonna be a million within a week watch this 😂. Get in there big man 😂
I wasnt the only one who thought the legacy looked like logang
Very chill, would love a room like that
This is a smart move 👍
Fuck you KSI, you are ashame of mentioning all those countries you didn’t mention Nigeria which is your country of origin
Even in my house I call it the box room
that room is sick
Make sure KSI gets Mo to live with him 🤣🤣
11:51 you're welcome 🥶
Yall didnt see Montanablacks room then
WSI
I’m a sparky in the Bedfordshire area, any chance you have any jobs going ? 😂
I saw you driving down the A3 in truck number 6 the other day!
You could have put in a water slide
no mention of dragon ball. disliked
Nice.
its mad fam
actual DUB as per request of JJ
Nah that room is soo fire dude. This give me ideas of what I can do to my own room. Great job. 👍
One thing that needs to be added as a finishing touch, is KSI's logo as a light
W room
Add a Prime Bar Fridge
Jjs electricity bill in that room is more than my entire house
heated floor...
Love the way you pronounce adhesive, not sure if it is the way to pronounce it but I still love it
Well it's fkn amazing but not best YouTube creation
Just wanted to say, you seem like a real professional, incredible preparation before the build and throughout your explanations of the stages and materials/objects being used were really clear, straightforward and made it clear that you are at the top of your field. Also it was a really made video, will be sure to hire you if i ever need anything!!
ngl i just wanna see his whole house looks massive
Ashville - You are on another level!
U could've added an Aquarium 😉
14:50 - This green screen montage! 🥰🥰❤️
Ashville Dub!!
Weirdly kept wondering if there were lights installed for the green screen like a backlight between the green screen and jj. Also lights too on the walls to light up ksi.
Soo sick man.. cant wait for jj to make videos in this room..
When they closed those curtains 😍the sound 👌
Frosted electronic glass. When you want natural light and privacy.
That's so coool
This is actually so sick
I might have to hit you guys up in the future this is mad you know 😂 that is an amazing room
Where can I get the acoustic curtains? 😂
Anyone else thought the dude at 8:37 looks like the spitting image of the Brazilian footballer, Fernandinho. Or is it just me lmao
WOW…Amazing makeover! Put a Prime fridge with Prime bottles innit 🔥
I cannot wait for kons bit with the tech
your voice is so clear wtf you should be in TV bro
Curtains could be more lower to block that light
Best set up of any Youtuber
I would remove the door handle and have a push unlock system so the back wall looks totally clean like the rest of the room…. But this is truly insane….
I’m watching this pretending I know everything that’s going on and what’s being talked about
very enjoyable and interesting voice
Nice people get nice things
sheesh
The wait is over!!
bro y dies jjs window look like a balcony to the outside
Wait is Jj in a two story apartment 🤯
Washville
i hope his new pc is WINDOWS activated lol
16:07 guess u haven’t seen that room ninja had with red bull

Tht room is short as a dog shelter ngl
This is sick

This is levels, I'm gassed for him 🔥🔥🔥🔥👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Now we need try not to laugh with anne marie
Audio guy's ears after KSI walks in: 📢📢
So your telling me the room behind him is all green screen! Damnnn
I saw a different video on tiktok where he said it would be the best set up on YouTube… I’m sorry Nickmercs and Ninja blow this out of the water
such an amazing job all round but them star lights tho 0_0 crazyyyy
you sound so profesional
Amazing work 🙏🙏
you guys are awesome!
Yoooo where is the prime Mini fridge
14:41  I imagine JJ's redit has already done lots of crazy stuff with that greenscreen.
This guys house is too big
dis is so fire
Thought it said logang w the sign
Thank you so much guys for making such a amazing room for our all fav fat neek!!!!
14:57 jj's in Paris ugh. ni*** in Paris?
I desperately want to see the rest of the house
i am sry i skipped but BIG UP ASHCILLE & MANDEM 4 dis AMZIN workk
U deserve more bro
cool
AYO, DID ONLY I HEARD A POLISH RADIO STATION PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND? IS THE WORKER A POLISH MAN?
He should enter Set Up Wars
man JJ looks smol next to u 😂😂
A lightsaber
Add a disco ball in the roof that you can press a button for it come down and up and maybe spins
I've been waiting for this for a long time , happy to see it . Looks great 👍🏻
And to think they did all this in 20 minutes. Props man,🙌🙌 seriously
That intro xD
Absolute sick video💪💪💪
Mental
What's that strange square next to the door
JJ has such a genuine reaction its hilarious
W ashville
Who paid for this - KSI or YouTube?
part 2 with computer !!!
Please do the rest of the sidemen!
sick video, the music you use is Steve will do it theme song 😂😂😂😂 just got steve steve steve in my head,whilst you're mapping out the spot lights.
GOD DAMN!!!!
bro JJ went half way across the world in one video
Not asking kon jj wow
Honestly, the proof we need to know that KSI is over 6'0 is how fucking small that phone looks in his hand.
you can tell he came from humble household to this
his studio probably costs my whole life
qpr's sponsor
for the lights, u could've added a longer sheet of fabric to cover the entire ceiling, to give it a seamless look. You could've also added a recording box on the side where the lights near the desk is, press a button and it unfolds with a mic stand just there with an acoustic damping closet kinda. If u get it, u get it.
Great work!
Bro this is sick its soo clean and simple as well defo good job done
18:26 Crazy how all this started from making stupid YouTube videos in his bedroom.      𝓛𝓔𝓖𝓐𝓒𝓨
L
I gonna subscribe now no.1 big fan of ksi jj from philippines
W ASHVILLE VIDEO
Constantine is constantly goood
I love the ceiling! Im gonna definietly try and get one of those soon!
Imagine Ashville building Mo's setup, that would be sick
kon will undoubtedly hook KSI up with a dope rig/setup to fit this room. Cant wait to see it completed
I wanna have this some day that would be my biggest accomplishment 😂
Ksi completing side missions.
Bojie
Me: first time watching this man ever anyway I look at the thumbnail and think oh shit why Ksi bodyguard on the thumbnail and then click the vid bla bla bla and then the guy turns out to be doing the renovating and stuff BRO what the actual fuck bro is a Greek good damn 😂

Bros house is so big that it looks like a luxury apartment building 😳
Need like a fridge built in yhe wal or somethin

Uk's biggest youtuber Jj:what's up hehehe
"Put me in America, AAAHHH there is shootings!!!"
Absolute pro, used to work just like that with my father when i was a kid, he was an electrician, a good one too, and he'd take me with him sometimes and i remember the people who we're paying us making barbecues and they would stay with us and and drink and we'd have fun while working. Haven't talked with my dad in a long time, when i was 16 he got sick, mentally ill, had a lot of problems with him but eventually we finded a mental hospital for him and a year later we moved to UK. Didn't had a good relationship after i was like 15, everyday he would just act like everything isn't good and he has no time, and he'd hurry and curse a lot, probably from the mental illness but by that time we already had a lot of fights and words. I dont really miss him because i'm quite emotionless if i could say such an corny ass thing, it's just that i dont get affected easily. but i did liked those "working days".

2:07 brooo that’s multiple levels his house must be huge
sheeesh
Soooo sickkkkkkkkkkkkkk the best set up I’ve ever seen ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥶🥶
Good vid, keep it up
Bro really got a whole Rolls Royce ceiling built into the room. KSI is actually so clear of everyone at this point 😪
Must be nice being UUUUUP!
His house is so big but wit small office 😂
this is so sick
Level of detail is incredible
just waiting for KON now !!
Got good food to go with a good video 🔥
is this where he makes videos
love how the room came together. the full blackout and starlight only is a vibe
1 thing you could off done siri or alexa
yooo you the guy man . this is hella nice  are you gonna tell the cost of the built .
skip the vid to 18:19 seconds  and it is the moment ksi realized he made it in life
you alreaaaadyyy knoowww how cold this is gunna look 🥶
Add a fridge for his PRIME
So deserves to be on trending. The quality and workmanship here is insane, not to mentioned the production of the actual video. Big congratulations 🎉
Elliot
But how does olajide olayinka williams olatunji pay for all this? Hes just a poor youtube boxer. Maye we should start a kickstarter for him?
amazing room the one thing it need to window and wall of movie to set any view like city or nature thing ❤️
Now we just need kon to do the set up, ittl be sickkkkkk
Simon definetly gonna try to 1 up him once he moves in his house
The only thing i can think about is to hide the pc in the wall/celling. Then there would only be the desk legs on the floor.
Massive dub
im bit skeptical bout it. i mean my opinions ain somethin to be considered for his choices but you see jj makin vids from a bedroom, back then of his mum's to now from his own, has somethin special bout it. a studio thingy for jj somewhat ruins the vibe of his vids. what do yall say?
punjabi and the folabi picture
This is sickkk
This video is Insane
My guy that edited this missed a beat when Jj was having fun with the greenscreen. Just had to make everything the opposite of what he was saying 😂
Someone please help me… does anyone know what program kon used to make those 3d renders?????
imagine having such a room and and a setup, and still has windows not activated in his screen. xD Anyway you guys did a great job, looks amazing!!
leng
Throw that make over, its to dark, it will hinder his creative process, it is a nice room, but not nice for creativity, KSI is better recolour the whole thing!
BIG W
All of this for Reddit videos
ashhy w
omg
what andrew tate doning in jjs house
I was just smiling all through ❤️🔥
That's sick
This room is a vibe
Starlight is crazy
Ultimate smoking room
The legacy neon light should've been different
The legacy neon sign should be Logang
It’s now time for Kon
Easy like and subscribe , great work
What is with the terrible thumbnail
Camera and lighting could have been sick
YOOO I was just about to start my channel and KSI shouts me out in his office!!! Thanks m8 😂
The only thing I don't like is the flooring everything else is sick. Its up to JJ whether he prefers hardwood or flooring but since he doesnt wear shoes in the house a light grey silk-like material carpet here would be so cold and it would help with the sound absorption as well although the mdf and foam are already doing a decent job at blocking the noise.
I'm confused is it a house or flat??
this is insane
This is fireeeee~ Seriously this is fireeeeeee!!!
JJ is like a kid in the world's largest toy/candy-store
Thank you Ashville, you give KSI/JJ something awesome gift 👍
Please do mini minters new house that would be such a good video
His voice is so calm to listen to tho
Why is bro living in one of the rooms from backrooms level
I mean a vacuum built into the floor and some confetti droppers in the ceiling so that he can celebrate and clean up his Ws like a champ. Aside from that he’s set.
the way this guy says project... im gonna start saying it like that. Pro Jek
I saw the thumbnail and thought they ditched kon but to see kon as a big part is a W
AstroDub
So fucking sick. love you man
Bro how big is his house
Mo is gonna have fun with this
The green screen is mo's paradise to troll jj.
I didn't know ksi's bodyguard is really good at interior designing.
Here’s an unnecessary idea, could’ve had frosted glass that changes to clear glass at a touch of a button, this is a crazy office room, well done 👍🏼
Yo this is so Sick!!
Yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
The handle!!! The door handle is getting on my nerve.
Bro so big his bicep is as thick as ksi's head its crazy
Only thing I would change it would be the handle on the door. Make it like a push handle or maybe something electronic. So the door can be completely hidden. Other then that this room is a dream for anyone to have as their office.
i thought it said "logang" but it aays legacy my bad
Can't wait to see how this looks in JJ's next videos
Ashville W
This is the best YouTube creation room
👀I love this room so much man, it is a really sick room💙, now hope kon keeps the vibe going❤‍🔥. shoot out to the crew, yall really did ur thing🏆. now if we can just get a bunch of uploads from ksi right
Bro is that JJ's house like the whole thing I'm seeing through that glass wall  Wow that dude is Rich
Great video! Awesome collab
Wowww 😍
0:16 always kills me 🤣🤣🤣
8:43 Why so many nails lmao 😂
Ummm, why is fernandinho working on the panels 😂😂😂??
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
a humidifier and its golden. amazing work guys!
Bros house is a hotel
make Simon's room bro 😌
Definitely earned a sub from me, wow.
I can tell JJs just gonna sit there messin with the lights for ages 😂
This is cold 👌🏽🔌
im gonna miss the basic set up background :(
pov you see this room before jj uploads his new room
Can't Wait For Miniminter To React To This
just setup an alexa and setups a W voice control would make it sick
ASHVILLE DUB
Our fatneek deserves the best of the best
He should add a couch in there
Imagine they made the stars in the ceiling the exact constellation of the night JJ was born. it would have been a big effort but would've been such a cool little detail I think. definitely not criticizing this. You guys have done an immaculate job! big up ❤
Ashville dub
Mans office looks like the inside of a Rolls Royce🔥🔥
Ksi gets a mad room and first video is a Reddit video 🤣🤣
All that to film try not to laugh reddit videos
idk man its dope forsure, but for who he is Nick Mercs got him beat with the best room. Biggest youtuber in UK needs something spectacular where he can film movies for the tube.
I think yall should try and work with Simon (Miniminter) to work on his setup at his new house or Ethan (Behz) to complete his room.
:0
I want pewdiepie to react to this
vibey room, and i see how you just let him enjoy it instead of butting in and stuff. good work man
JJ looks so small sat next to him🤣🤣
You are a big dude lol
Wtf is his house???? 2:05
There's no words its just insane
The quality man...
This is super crazy! It’s a dream for someone. Can’t wait to watch KSI and sidemen videos with that background in it. Put the play button on the top shelf
One day 🙌
Would have been nice if the curtains could block out 100%. Seems there’s an inch off the floor not blocked out.
Big banger
What is the square in the wall
how much were you paid for such a detailed work
Can't wait to see him recording in that room absolutely amazing job well done 👏🏼🤍
First time here, I got to say I love the commentary.
You're cool as hell and I just subbed
I have a question, what would you in the case if something behind the fabric ceiling, for example the speakers, randomly stopped working. Would you have to take it all out for inspection or have you made a way so that you can check things behind the fabric without taking the whole thing out?
🔥🔥🔥
IT IS MAGICAL! I LOVE IT. IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE FROM A SPECIFIC ANGLE, THAT THE ROOM IS FLOATING IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE OUT IN SPACE!!!!
It would be stick if there was a prime mini fridge
Oh wow cool You built KSI's dream office! So what?
Honestly I wouldn't mind a mini fridge, but other than that its fuuuucking sick man! <3
W
This is actually shit, after a year I expected something more crazy than that
Common Ashville W
Bro This Guy's House Is So Massive Man. MashAllah. Really A Beautiful Home.
this is acc sick!
In a few years time, you will be credited as someone who elevated KSI to the next level of creativity
ofc the all time great TNTL 😂 JJ knows what we want
you can tell JJ is always training coz he still;l got his massive 4litre bottle
Amazing job guys 🙏🏻👌🏻
No copyright for the song😂
okay so JJ, what are thinking budget wise for this room? JJ: yes
Do more of these dan
Need more of them!!
Bad man level quality big W
How much..... we all wanner know.
ksi without dragonball stuff in his room. hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
افضل الصلاة والسلام على النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم
Ashville Dub
The fact that he was asked what his first videos will be in here and he replied with "probably reddit or try not to laugh" this is why I love JJ he just keeps it real 😂😂😂
bro is jj living in the backrooms?  🤣
Dude litterly rich as fuck and was having the worst setup in the sidemen. Finally he treats himself with a great office.
How much did this cost ashville 👀
jimmy broadbent could use a setup lol
This is too good man
Amazing. Shorter clips are better Daniel. Some of your longer uploads I just don't have time to view.
Ksimon poster is missing
Where is the in wall garage for a Roborock. It changed my room when i added a Roborock that automaticly starts cleaning when i turn off my pc
Cool 😎
Imagine this is like him activating windows. He’s just so used to this set up he doesn’t actually use it😂
JJ’s House is massive U’know
His house actually looks like an hotel😂
i would have loved it if the a sick ksi sign would be there
Anyone else only able to hear Steve Will Do it’s intro 😂 sick room tho I’d come just to chill
that room is a stoners dream man i swear
i wanna see some horror game
There is no lock on that door. He's gonna need one when he has kids hahaha
As A Sparky i wanna know where tf you got the fibre star lights xD theyre awesome
Where’s the prime fridge?
This company, in combination with Kon is 🔥
Sheeesh
YouTube videos about to be sick
really weird and awkward how you didn't at least say hello to him at the start
Don’t say oh my god again it hurts god still love you KSI😘 🥰🥰😍😘❤️❤️❤️💒💒💒
Wville
Finally, what a room 😍
ASHVILLE DUB 🔥🔥🔥
i wanna see the rest of his house my god
Heated floors?
Kon's about to get a killer fucking vid with this setup he's gonna be exquisite
WAshville
Im already i see the memes just from this one vid 💀
AMAZING video loved the editing and they way it flowed, great room as well. Absolutely killed it!
You should ask Miniminter to do the room in his new house.
Kon and ashville should do more of these collabs it’s awesome!
ASHVILEE DUB 💙
I am so jealous that room is absolutely phenomenal
amazing
House tour
ashvill major dub w win copped a vibe u just popped off man its legit insane fam
Only thing we need is a dedicated ‘sidemen gaming channel’! 🔥 another channel for more subscribers!!
That's amazzzzing
Awesome job guys looks fantastic, KSI got shook! 🤣
Have u guys seen Miniminter’s reaction yet? He’s looking to get his done as well
He better pay them well 👍
Actual dub
Same wallpaper as my big bros he has black and yellow wallpaper
You guys should try to work with syndicate that would be awesome
It is crazy how JJ always gets lucky to get surrounded by these creative people in all the different things he does. Well done guys 😂👏👏🔥🔥🔥
BANGING ya knocked that straight out of the park 🤩🤩🙏✌
lit ep.
nice
Damn Bro…. Damn.. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What ended up happening with the smoke alarm?
Damn, this guy's voice is so calming
As someone who knows nothing about interior decoration, this was satisfying to watch
Even Nigel Farage supports KSI keep it up he said you’re very good for the youngsters and I agree
When's the set up
I would have added hot glue to the velcro underside. It'll give with time
Question, is this ksi’s home he bought, like it’s HIS, or is it like another apartment or like penthouse typa thing.
Hang the music awards on the wall.
Ashville didn't disappoint!!! That room is sick!!
I don't think JJ will even remember what buttons for what
In wall subwoofers, Atmos surround not just stereo? Nice job though
What could be added? Another couple of drop inches to the acoustic curtains Bro!
jj is gonna get well High in that room well listening to his songs i can just see it lmao
this was so cool
You could’ve added a meteor shower in the star lights so once in a while there’s a meteor shower
I love it but the room is a bit too small:(
Wow , stuff of dreams , better than my house 😂
In my honest opinion it’s pretty underwhelming (not trying to be negative hater ) just speaking from heart
Wt about kon?
🔥🔥🔥
You should make Ksi a home studio
Try syndicate has he has lots of ideas for his house next door
reddit gonna be so happt cause they gonna get more content for jj
man said some ambiance
It would be more exciting if u could add voice command
I still don't really now what Daniel Ashville's focus area is. Interior designing or Aggregates. What is the future for Ashville????
I though Kon was doing this? Poor guy Edit: I have my answer. This is amazing well done
he said what’s the first thing you’re gonna create. mans like ksi said a reddit video
This is awesome great work guys
This whole video was sick from start to finish. Absolutely fantastic work on the room to the tiniest detail. You guys smashed it!
That's so cool. Wanna do this to my room? 😅
Truly amazing X)!!!!!
Next make him his own music studio in his own house
JJ is such down to Earth.. bless him 🌹
3:15 thought he had unreleased blue Yzy 450s
The room is a vibe
Fam his house looks like a hotel hahaha, mad transformation though fr
BANGER!!!!!
What happened to the smoke detector issue you had - did the council see sense and allow it to be under the fabric?
Ashville BIG W
Nice work! Looks great
This room is Epic!! Well done Daniel and @Ashville @Thisisashville, we want to see more of these type of videos, as well as developments. Looking forward to episode 100 too! 🥂❤🙌🏾🔥👌🏾
Waiting for miniminter to react to this
Finally, someone more animated than Daniel.....u could tell that KSI was holding back on the crazy👊. The execution on the job was fire, feeling very enlightened 👏👏👏
I swear Sidemen are #blessed in so many ways
UK biggest youtuber lmfao
Heavy dub ashville
Big up. This is a really good job. Shout out Ashville!
Rahh all this work for a reddit recap haha bruh
Now when he does sidemen reacts, vik won't be the only one to go to the office, JJ can go to the offfice
He is massive making Ksi look small
Ashville dub
Miniminter has bought a house that he is going to move into so I think that you should talk to him about his office
“This is hard bro” - KSI
Next should be “Vikkstar123’, Kon has also said Vikk is next for a setup after JJ so I’m guessing Vik would need a custom designed setup, would also be a big video! Like if agree
Asheville W
Nice
He deserves everything 🙌🙌
Of course it is amazing but I’d prefer if natural light came through the window and not the lights of the rest of the house
That is how you do a collarb, I bet ashivelle will be doing a million in no time.
@Merl 👀
His room looks amazing but his house looks like a whole 7 star hotel 😂
🔥🔥🔥
this don is so wham wtf
Nah bro has one of the cleanest offices I’ve ever seen which is crazy when you consider his precious setups and the fact that kon still hasn’t finished it
W2s next
Mo gonna turn the green screen into his room background anyway
Common Ashville W
Wheres he gonna put his bed.
this is insane 👍
Cancel KSI WE COMING FOR YOU
I loved everything but that ugly dark color you painted the beautiful hard wood floors. That has to be a sin
Needs that black Asheville QPR shirt!
Needs that black Asheville QPR shirt!
Well played ashville 🔥
Awesome Daniel, you and your crew have delivered above and beyond what was required and that's down to your creative vision . KSI is one lucky chap!

I can’t wait for Kon’s video to see the full setup 🤩
So what was the outcome with the fire alarm in the end?
today is my birthday... please wish me 🙏🙏🙏
i hate that person to moan.but that light gap at the bottom of the curtains would do my head in
Wheres the mini fridge full of prime?
Loved the way he said, "MO is gonna have so much fun with this"❤🥺
I would add a recording sign on the outside door like they have on radios or like *on air* I think that would be cool
Must say sexy colour palette happening there just so happen to be  my favourite colours too lol
THIS IS UNREAL!
I love that this man is going through the steps to teach us
60min makeover 😂😅
Mo seeing the new green screen: 😈
comeonnnnnnn ashvilleeee you da besttt overall. ,, and KSI. am your FAN for liife this is madd great joyous personalityyy 😎

One of the  best thing. About dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves some thing .he always respect us the audience and his team and he is always polite in all his videos.we congrulate ourseleves on this achievement .more to come and everthingsto come .
add a subwoofer
finally
KSI getting you a copyright strike right there 😂😅
Wtf kind of editing did they do to KSI’s face in the thumbnail? 💀
That room is sick man. Well done Daniel
Just imagine how many hours of footage this could be...
Maybe a fridge somewhere
Yesss!!
Kons fuming
Impressive work from ashville 🙌🏼
Why does it feel like jj is the guy who would just go back to filming in his bedroom because he's gotten use to it?
Massive dub
Washville
Amazing build and very hard working ASHVILLE DUB
It’s crazy how this room is the same size as a New York apartment 😂
no intro 😢
Kon is gonna top everything off now
This is too fire, the effort put into this is outstanding
This is shit.
This the best YouTube room and WWW
I don’t know who KSI is
Daniel, love the timing of this to coincide with the ksi fight. Will get you many more clicks. Ksi also is an absolute machine. His work rate and productivity is next level. Congrats all.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Wow 😯😯
Bro wtf I had no idea this video dropped
Miniminter is buying a house with talia 👀 do his office next
Love how he said "Mo's gonna have so much fun with this" 😂😂😂
These guys are GOOD!
This is why you deserve the success Daniel , remember watching the walking to work live when you got lost in southall 😂😂, keep it up my brother blessings and blessings upon you and your team
This video is Trending 27 in usa.  And trending 1 in uk. And trending 9 in Canada.
This is great work, but does jjs content require this?
Levels🙌🏾👌🏾
"I'm in America, ahh the shootings get me out of here "
Only the best job from ashville looks amazing 👍🏻👍🏻
Absolutely essential to have a mini fridge
NGL BIG L
Man sounds like Daley, Deji’s coach 😂
Awesome Daniel, you and your crew have delivered above and beyond what was required and that's down to your creative vision . KSI is one lucky chap!
All that work for norhing
next you have to do simons office from the sidemen
Is there any air filtration system or vents? Feels like I would lose oxygen after an hour of being sealed in there.
so cool man
Ashville doing bits!
I can’t imagine how many racks this cost
But have you seen Motanablacks gaming room?
Now we’re all gonna be on Kons case to get the rest of the room complete. KSI needs his new set up to match his sick room. GG Ashville 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Why does Jj look like he’s from the metaverse 😭
Man this is sick 🔥 like fr love the details and you can just see how much Jj likes it. Big ups Daniel and the team !!
he needs a mini prime fridge
These people ain’t built right. They look like shit this is illegal behavior YouTube like whatever they gonna mob gang beat you to death one day Yalls know that right? Whatever, yeah cleo scratch the bed grrrr
Intro made jj look like his son loooool
That’s so sick
You guys need to add a minifridge for the prime
Mo is gonna take this thing over
Number 1 trending 🤯🤯
Cant stand the fella
Saya tidak tau bahasanya 🤭🤭🤭
What a difference. Its brilliant to see the work thats went into it. What a room 😲
That's wholesome and can't wait for kon to finish his setup asap 😭😫
What the
Only if it all was voice controlled as well
This room is so sick if i was gonna add/change anything it would be making the green screen go around each wall so its can be a 3d green screen so instead of being limited to the one wall it can look like hes doing alot more. An amazing transformation so gassed to see the vids coming from him
Best room transformation! Nothing’s beating this one
Another home run video from ashville!
As usual, the Ashville magic wand has made the space spectacular. I love the way you use the video to advertise as well.
I need a ashville room ! 👌
Big Up Daniel for the awesome job. Congratulations KSI.
How is my man so eloquent 😭
very nice work!
KSI's house looking like an apartment complex
Asheville best in the business
My guy Daniel saying a whole lot of "WE" 🤣🤣🤣🤣

the door handle slanting down and the panel coming off the left wall :(
🔥🔥🔥
What’s this office for? Because he’s still in his normal setup in his new videos.
Yo yo you know what would be hard for KSIs setup his Boxing Championship Belts hung up on the wall as a Display that would be hard
Looks absolutely sick
ASHVILLE DUB
Miniminter room
You could have added a mini fridge
I beg someone activated his windows on his pc
Dinner: meatloaf with bacon gravy,   mash potatoes, roasted asparagus and homemade onion rolls. Mango Tajin popsicle 8/27/2022
Very Noice
Amazing and clean design. Everything looks fantastic. Was thinking of it it would be possible for the top half of the window to lower itself towards the bottom half so it could be like a balcony thing and being able to see his house for anyhting. Just a thought
hello to those who read this, I take 1 minute of your time to tell you that Jesus loves you with all his heart and that he calls you to follow him, because he loves you so intensely that he is put on the cross to wash away your sins because he loves you more than anyone in this world and Jesus Christ has a plan for you and know that he is coming soon and this world of depravity is over the point of disappearing ✝️
W
What's behind the cut out in the wall?
Great video. ☺️
And the win bro he is living life big W’s to JJ
Love your builds great work 🔥🔥🔥     Only thing is missing is a moon lol
Closed curtains really set a tone to ULTIMATE ROOM
I don't wanna see jj use a green screen i think it will ruin his videos because used to him running around a shit so I think he should only use it for certain things
Who measured the curtains 😬
JJ’s content is abt to be that much more insane! Great fucking work
Miniminter
W
Ksi is going to fuck in that room
Do KSI's studio next
Been watching the Ashville channel since the first episode of Ashville Weekly, nice to see you grow so much into the YouTube scene
Looks wicked!! I did notice the light seeping through the bottom of the curtains that would wind me up abit tho lol
this is amazing but nothing like nickmercs bunker
Black tinted windows would of been so hard
Dam that's awesome well done Asheville that's dope
Who’s here after JJ is now 4-0-1?
Wow this is absolutely sic. I think he’s gonna spend a fair few hours lying on the floor looking up at the stars lol
Why is this so relaxing
heated floors
Mo is going to have fun with that green screen
Nice job guy's
He won
NEXT LEVELS!
**heated floor
Thats what appreciation is
Stunning.
This is the sickest office I’ve seen
He should just put up his three diamond plaques
All that big money and its really not all that at all. LED lights, a desk and a green screen. Really could've done a but extra for that wow factor
I would of tried putting stars in the part of the roof the green screen covers so you get a full ceiling view and not have it like two parts. Other than that though. You smashed it again Daniel
Amazing job well done great work that would have taken ages for them ceiling lights
Amazing
Ashville delivering as per usual .....big ups 🔥
Pure 🔥
The craftsmanship that has gone into that room is totally insane and the details are second to none. That's the way a high end build should be done. Top work as always.
Ashville dub
Now waiting for Kon to spread the magic now 💕🤍
Asheville dub !!!
👍😎❤️
Love this guy’s voice
Where is the dreaded white fire alarm hiding then.
Incredible 😭
Why is the thumbnail so edited? Like those aren't even KSIs teeth😂
Maddddd levels 👌👌👌👌👌 I’m lovin the starlight ceiling 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Absoloutely incredible, A dream room!
Amazing work, especially the starlight, but one thing botheres the eye, the door handle. Bet you could have done something different with that .
I respect JJ not wearing shoes in his house😌💯
SteveWillDoIt intro music around 4:55
Impressive👍🏾
Nice but light can be seen coming in all along the top rail and the  curtains are  too short  i wouldn't  be happy with that seriously .
who says money can't buy happiness 😃😃😃😃
Sick room
Another high quality job from Ashville 👍
That cost him 90k or something
ksi knockout
Ashville ashville ashville I love you men this YouTube room is the best.  Daniel can we have a tour of ur apartment please.  U got good taste
The only thing wrong about this is that there's only space for 3 diamond play buttons when he gets his 4th for moresidemen he ain't got a place to put it 😂😂😂
Another top video and a brilliant job been waiting to see this and wow well worth the wait
MAN LIKE ASHVILLE WINNING
JHEEZE 1 on trending !!!
We can see that jj really likes traveling
KSI is a b itch   Top G for life
Liked the wall fabric clip...
can you do a price break down for the room
Good luck to KSI for his fight tonight
This is beyond amazing. Love it all. Amazing work 👏🏽
Bro just from what u can see in this video, JJ's house looks crazy. It motivates me and also makes me a little sad that I'm not living in a place like that right now lol. But I know it takes HARD work and sacrifice to live like that. Anyways, cool ass setup
looks lovely
this is truly amazing
W
Wtf is jjs house it looks like he’s got apartments in his home
jjs house is WHAMMMMMM
You should make miniminters room in his new house
Should of used star lights under the green screen
This is by far the sickest video From you boys 🥶

Great makeover
Dude he looks weird in the thumbnail Kon work on lighting Man
JJ's house bro tf 😳😨
Brilliant .
Awesome again from Ashville! It's great to see a customer so pleased with everything. Now I'm waiting to watch what your mate Michael O'Donovan has to say 🤣
bro if i was the one put in charge of doing the roof i would piss right off! LOL
it would be sick if he made a gaming channel more content
1st video to be filmed in this studio by KSI: "Thank you Ashville"
Nice one, Daniel & Ashville team.
High quality. I think your the new Nick knowles for the rich and famous lol
Coffee maker
🥇👌🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Top class! Good to see KSI in a naughty Herman Miller Embody too! Levels
Ashville plaque on the door!
He should 100% make vr vids with that space
I don’t really trust Con. Not sure why
This man definitely deserves a sub
Too cold
Now Get Vikkstar new studio and specify that guy to upload vlogs.
Why didn’t you sand and finish the floor properly? Amateurish with those toy sanders
Daniel your team & you delivery. That room is something else it’s just out of this world list for wards dude. This comment is like everyone else’s there is just no wards.  Daniel you really can’t stop making Ashville content  and videos every week you don’t realise The inspiration and effect you have on people with your videos. I’ll say and from all of us thank you 🙏 👍🏻
Add a KSI hashtag it'll gain nuff new eyes
First content he’ll record in there will be on onlyfans.. haha 😂😂
siiiick i wish someone could give my room a makeover lol
ASHVILLE X KSI   Two of my favourite youtube creators
go check abo flah set up its better than this promise
Leak of the setup with the plaques 😂😂
make the fiber optic threads transmit a message that say's "Ashville" or "KSI"
Brilliant.
Vikk!
Why isn’t this on kons channel?
I NEED THIS BRO. TRUST ONE DAY.

Brilliant lovely room I want my home theatre to be like that great job
Loosing respect for KSI!!!!
Very nice!
15:00 bruh 😂😂
It's insane what you guys have done with the room, true craftsmanship!   I wish Kon had been there for the reveal as well, but now the pressure is on him to deliver and I can't wait to see what he does 😂
This is insane! Not only as a room transformation but as a video, this was put together so well. You can see how genuinely happy JJ is with it
Jeez! Absolutely brilliant!! Well done… I could imagine how KSI feels lol like a child again!!! Great job 👏🏾
Now we wait for Kon
smart uploading at this time... great video too! :)
Great work bespoke is the one..💪🏽
I’m bored
did you put his smoke detector back up
Love that ceiling!
Daniel was too heavy for that access panel.  That text was to get someone down there to sort that out!
Looks dope! Everything ashville is nailed! Refurbs yard content editing everything! Props all involved!
Very nice! I love the lights, I'd have that in every room in my house if I could lol
Ashville dub
Ngl can't wait until jj  does his first video in this room
Absolutely amazing room for JJ hats off to ashville they are amazing
Fantastic work Asheville think you should do ninja room
That set up and workmanship is seriously incredible!
W
Wow wow this is sooooo sick. This is a  creator’s dream.
Your next project, after Liz, should be Buckingham palace.
You guys are killing it ,keep it up very inspiring.
14:35  His bromance with Mo is wholesome..
The Best Creative Room Ever.
the screen is a little present for moe
Common Ashville W
But isn't Dantdm UKs biggest youtuber
Amazin'
The single thing im thinking is voice control - or I just missed that part haha 😃 either way sick job, Ashville W
While I have always liked the ‘scuffed’ feel to JJ’s vids being filmed with his bed as the backdrop, it’s nice to see him finally get a sick setup
Never heard of the sticker man & never heard of KSI, before they appeared on Ashville (honest)
This video is 🔥🔥
Absolutely smashed this!! Can't wait to see the finished set-up in the room!! Its got to be vikkstar up next surly????
This is absolutely fantastic. Wonderful job. The intricacies of your work and how it all came together is beautiful
😳😳😳🤩🤩🤩🤯🤯🤯
Room looks great, light still comes through when the curtains are closed at the bottom think you need to look at that
You forgot the AC loool that room gonna be hot af
Daniel the hard hat you wear where did you get it please
The room is insane, and that house looks like a mansion
Siiccckkkkkkkkkkkkk
Them Reddit vids finna be more epic
I really want to do this but I’m to broke 😭
What a time to post the video!
Not hating or doubting the guys popularity as I have never watched anything from KSI but going by what I have seen of KSI on Ashville I don't think he actually said anything worth listening to? All I heard was laughs and screams. Great room by the way Dan, the level of workmanship is amazing. I can see where the big money gets spent. Will you be at the O2 tonight for the fight? Might see you there.
Wwwwwwww
Also genius release schedule.
f****** beautiful all im gunna say😂
I love that his first immediate thought was the fun that Mo would have!
shame them acoustic curtains didn't go all the way to the floor, the light coming in would irritate me to f**k but great job ashvile
The Curtains seemed just a little short allowing too much Light in beneath. Other than that small comment Excellent Creative Space.
Now kon will just add some makeup on this beautiful girl 🔥🔥
Where I should the stripper pole. Daniel, you knocked that project out of the ball park. You will get so much more business from this work.
Ashville Interiors Ltd coming soon to all YouTube rooms !!! Epic finish & detail. Done again Daniel 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
JJ is #goals
What a sick room
The dance moves cmon
Wow the ceiling must have taken ages threading the star light optics, but I have to say it looks awesome, it's making me want to do star lights and just lay down on the floor looking up and watching the colours, KSI your one lucky guy.
Sick cinema room vibes
Good room to beat can’t lie vibe and the curtain ting cmon
U gotta put a prime mini fridge
That's a really nice room. Well done Ashville. My only two issues is the curtain length needs to be to the floor & the door handle sags. Handles should sit at 90 degrees. I'm being picky though & love 99% of it.
Damn, you guys need more views and likes. The room looks amazing! Great job, keep it up! :D
Was here before the video blew up
It is amazing man🔝🔝🔝💯
There are levels! This was crazy good use in the space they had. Mad respect!
This is amazing
Awesome Daniel and big up to JJ. However I’m curious as to how you made the fire/smoke alarm be integrated into the roof and colour code them?
My god it’s so nice to see a young man gone beyond next level in life we’ll done JJ and ASHVILLE  well well u guys have done a BAD ASS JOB ON THIS ROOM WELL DONE ASHVILLE
Excellence.
Ashville dub
Jj faze ruggin it 😂
you gotta go sort out Syndicates streaming room next...!
Fire! as per usual Ashville smack it out off the park... Next level setup...Its Art
His house is huge. Yup we can tell
ABOUT TIME IT WAS FINISHED
The way Daniel just shoved him along in the chair at 3:11 🤣 man said get over there
Absolutely insane!!!  The details, the fit and finish - everything is perfection!  I can't wait to see what it looks like when it's fully decorated and his set up is complete!
House so big he has a balcony looking down like apartments
I would add strippers or midgets to make it better just my suggestion
very sick
This is absolute fire 🔥
This one takes the cup bro 💯
Welcome to the new series of “pimp my room”! 😂  Awesome build though, well done!
I thought the room would be bigger to be honest but it looks good
Sick video!
Levels 💯🥇🔥👊🏾
Good timing on releasing the video, all eyes on him today
What is it all on Lutron? which one?
Shout out Asheville
The Audio quality in the room no echo at all is amazing. The sound deadening is on point
Great idea for the ceiling
i cant wait till jj uploads a video now
mental
Could've added a car stand to the room, idk... just saying.
Aligning yourself with someone whose against free speech ain't a smart move
Yesss! Finally, can’t wait to see Jj videos here
Sidemen Vikstaar room
that shit is such a vibe
Looks amazing
Never heard of him.
KSI's setup is insane now
Bangin
Daniel you and your team have smashed it out of the park! That room is amazing!
Ksi should put his beerus chain on the shelf
Unsubscribe to ksi go to rumble this is person from the matrix look his grape vids it’s horrible this guys hate woman
This is another level. Sick
What can I say ash , just off the scale
is the existing ceiling  fire rated ? looks like it
Love how all the fans ignore Tate smashing Ksi last night making Ksi take a huge L
14:37 He respects his guys. That's why he is our favourite
Ashville W........This is going to take Ashville to the next level!!! Amazing work Daniel
Next level green room for KSI, Daniel and your team delivered yet again 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👍🏾
Simon is def gonna react to this video
OMG, Daniel‼️You’ve done incredible work before, but this room is next level!!! Major kudos to you and your team‼️
Nailed it!!! 🤩 wow’z
Ksi should film this
W
Yooooo this is hard… can’t wait for kin to wrap it up 🔥🔥🔥
You should do something with the sticker man YouTube room, because you can't fit on there Daniel
Massive W!   One thing i feel like you guys missed out on is making the "Legacy" sign color changable.
Are you available for a refurbishment in Northwest of England?
Looks so amazing🎆
This guy is a mastermind in building
W in the chat
What a sick room
👍👍👍👍
Damm looking good 👌🏻
Man need to start working internationally. this was sick.
A proper dream room. The sky is the limits with the ashville team
No one is gonna talk about “bro you got the legacy AAAAAAAHAAAAH”?? 12:25
very impressive.
That padding room thoe jhezzze 🔥🔥🔥
Levelssss
Did you incase the first alarm??
Even better than I expected
Amazing!
Excellent, thanks
Out the park
Mehn i love seeing jj happy🥺
Brother this is absolutely incredible, seeing JJ happy makes my day too, biggup Ashville!!!
This video doesn't do justice to the amount of detail you put into you building projects, you should do a chanel just focusing on the building projects
so sick man good job
very impressive finish. you have some talented boys on the team. love the cleat solution to hang the ceiling panels.
Shame this guy sold out top g
I think someone like Tom syndicate could be your next person
Next level 💯
nice room
Big up Daniel and the team. Looks amazing 💥👊🏽💯
🙏...
👏👏👏 can't wait to see Kon do the set up
The ceiling part is so tiring and satisfying to the same proportion.
The Rolls-Royce ceiling ❤️🔥❤️
Smashed it
Very nice gents congrats to all involved
The attention to detail… outstanding!!!
you did an amazing job keep up the good work KING
The planning that goes into this type of room, I never would have thought it. Cool stuff
This is so sick wtf
You never explain that JJ and KSI are two names for the same person; had to Google it to work out... Also, is there more to explain about who Kon is, other than specifier of desks to (apparently) prominent YT creators?
I can see the rest of the sidemen using Ashville for work around their properties in future
Bro we need house tour
Imagine JJ in a few months is just like, nah I don't rate it I want a different office
Rah the detail on every single thing in the room. Levels
One word…details. Incredible work Daniel and the team. I hope this project elevates your company to the next level, you deserve every success! 👍
Dam you have actually smashed Ksi's media room to a next level of coolness that starlight roof has to be what makes the room perfect even with the drop down green screen.  Daniel your team smashed it . If I was their boss I'd be so proud of them and their craftsmanship ten ten all dam day 💙👊
Amazing well done
Do Simons setup with his new house !!!
Try vikstarr
Ahhhhh fucking 100000 times better than I ever thought yes jj fully deserved !!!! 👏  but alls I saw was mega  dollar signs everywhere
I love this so much I dont understand a thing he is syaing and gets me intrigued and I subbed because of it
Can’t wait to see the finished setup! The Room itsself is crazy! With Kons Setup JJ finally won‘t have to use his speakers as his camera mount anymore😂
🔥🔥🔥
Can’t wait for Mo to find new places to put up Simons pictures
About the only time Ashville can use commercial music is when the artist themselves plays it. Haha,
Spectacular finish 🔥🤍🔥🤍🔥
Smoke detector??
2:06 KSI's home is fire!
Ashville Dub
You know you’ve got a big house when you’ve got a full ass sky bridge to the other side of the house and a courtyard in the middle
Excellent work.
The room is on fire 🔥
I’m an Interior Design student, and seeing the process is amazing, the team made great creative solutions, it was frankly a boring room, now it has personality and it relates a lot to what JJ is all about, great job you guys, I’ve learned a couple of things from this video
Been waiting on this one
I used to think of myself as a well put together person, after this I now realise I am jealousy incarnate 😂
Fabulous 👌 👏 👍
@4:00 yoo these editors, some Hollywood effects 🤣
Jj should put his 10M Diamond Play Buttons on that shelf by the door, KSI on top shelf, JJ on middle shelf, and Sidemen on bottom shelf
I agree about the curtains. They could put a strip of velvet at the bottom. Attach  the same star lighting at the bottom connected at either end, and feed the upper part of the curtains with it. When closed you will see the same starlight pattern from top to bottom. Now that would look Sick!
bruuh the attention to details is nuts!
When doing the green screen bit . JJ missed the perfect chance to say “now I’m in the Asheville yard”
It needs a QPR framed shirt.😁 Excellent work by all concerned.
good job big dan and the team 💪😎
Been buzzing to see this 👌🏽👍🏽👍🏽
how are you m8 u couldnt do me a favour get me dianas rs she wants me have a give u money back just until a get to me stash🦁🦁🦁🦁
Looks sick incredible finish amazing craftsmanship 🇬🇧👍😀
Naa this is levels, Ashville smashed it out the park, just levelled up the game!
Asheville W
Very high Quality of work. Banging job
nice🥳
Fucking Hell , Whatever JJ does , He takes it to Whole New Level 🔥🔥🔥
YOOOOOO. Can't wait to see KSI making his new videos in this new setup after the fight
What a room serious work well done Asheville
This is going to be JJ's Sex-Dungeon.
That is another level! Wow 🤩
Mo gonna have a lot of fun with the green screen
Help Linus tech tips!
Awesome Daniel 👌🏽 the door handle annoys me though as it's not straight like the rest of the clean lines in the room 🤣OCD🤣
Very nice 👌 👍 👏🏼
Include a XIX sign bro
Levels upon levels!!! 👌🏼
I can't wait for the green screen to replicate his basic guest room setup!
That's epic 😍
Still going to have his camera on a speaker
COLD
That's incredible gents!
KSI we know you can box but owing Daniel 3 bags for the laughing if I was you I'd be paying that pretty quickly 😂😂
I think the curtains should be a bit longer so there is no gap in between the floor and the curtains so the outside light cant get to the room. Everything else looks really nice.
How did u not sneak a ashville a in their somewhere amazing results
Asheville took levels to new levels with this it looks insane Daniel
Nice
Omg Fernandinho help build legacy of KSI setup that is clean too clean
Anyone else really want to know what that square is to the left of legacy?
Ashville W
What an amazing room! Great job to everyone, top class workmanship went into making that master piece 😎
That is attention to detail Daniel
I love Ashville construction 🔥🔥🔥 Totally felt the vibe as soon as the music connected 👌🏾🎉☝️ Fantastic makeover, Congratulations JJ, well deserved, enjoy creating 🎉👌👏🏾🤗
Ksi is jokes 🤣🤣🤣 Big up dan lovely room bruv

W
The power of YouTube. I don’t think ksi would of known Daniel if he didn’t start YouTube.. shows how powerful the platform is and the variety of clients it can bring going forward
"very small area" would hate to see what you say about my home office then 🤣
So how much would that cost if I wanted a room the same .... looks amazing 👏  👌
Maaaannnnnn this is sickkkkkkkkkkkk
Look at montana blacks room this is nothing
Daammmmmnnnn

Simplicity and detail is the 🔑
So sick
AshvilleDUB
Ashville Dub!!
This room is unreal and JJ deserves it bro!
Nice built but honestly speaking it’s not all that as I was hoping
Like a child on Christmas... He deserves it, mad respect but damn the room is sick
Amazing beauty
He gets a big dollar room makeover and the first thing he says Is mo is gonna have fun with this. Big up mo 😂
And this is why good work costs money 💷 💷 💷
Ashville Dub WWWWW
Can’t wait for him to make videos in here
Jesus so sick
I'm sure it'd be difficult, but a Collab between you guys building the room and Linus tech tips doing the tech part of it would be amazing
Where did you end up putting the smoke alarm
dem so cooooooooooool!
Daniel get ready for those YouTube Makeover Rooms Orders !!!!🔥🔥🔥. You deserve everything that comes your way 👍👍👍👍……. Yanni will be looking for one at Mates Rates 😜😜😜😜😜👍👍
Inspiring
Amazing video
Inspiring
Well done to the Ashvielle team, quality of JJ’s room is insane!   He’s done amazing things and I’m sure this will reward you handsomely. Smashed it and what a great day to upload 😉
Change the windows to the samsung smart windows would of been a huge flex for jj
I could live in that room alone and be happy
Sorry, but I have never heard of him until now
Well done bro vid is a banger
realy amazing, but the curtains could be lower distance from the ground
Next level Daniel and Ashville team. Great workmanship
Bro the room is so sick. Phenomenal job my guy. Now it’s time for kon to work some magic of his own. I’m excited
Weekend job why it take 6months
You should do jezza from f2

Well done and even in the right time too , today is his fight  big ups ashville and kon
Wow just wow. Amazing work from the guys at Ashville hooking our boy PP up 🔥🔥🔥
Ashville w
18:02 the moment where JJ grabs the ad rev hahahah
Where’s the mini fridge with the primes at ???
His house is a hotel
Wow! Absolutely amazing.  Awesome attention to detail by team Ashville 👌👏👏👍
Ngga i would just go in the room just to vibe bro fr fr 💯
Best studio i ever seen in my life literally THE BEST... i hope kon gives his best in this setup
Great work. Love the details
It's sikkkk...but what I would add is like the thing with legacy the lights but add one for prime bottle, a boxing glove and a microphone to emphasise not in words but the image of it...the boxing, the drink and the singing
Sic room... how about putting star lights in the floor? (finished with some epoxy)
Looks amazing great job 👏
Wow outstanding 👌🏻
Yeah thats sick.. As Daniel would say. NICE EE. 👌🏼
Thats a another great Ashville build. Your work just gets better. In joy JJ.
This is just a madness!!!
Ashville Dub!
the lighting on the ceiling ! Would love that but maybe an the milky way streaking through the middle
What an amazing looking house! It’s great to see JJ’s response, he loves it! And I love how it’s all about the creativity.
This is SO good! I hope this brings so much more business to you!!! So deserved
You done it again Daniel well done am super proud of u darling  Take care
Proper Job!
Amazing work!
Imagine listening to music in that room! A whole vibe
Anyone wonder what happens when they need to replace the green screen? Like would it be easy to do?
Daniel you smashed it man! Absolutely smashed.
Smashed it. Hyped it up and delivered
It's about time
Who would win in a fight between Daniel & JJ???
Craftsmanship at its best. Very, very, classy.
3 W’s for KSI today - this is so fire 🔥
OMG.....Smashed it again....
It's not the best. Ahu fallah shits on it
Only difference I would’ve made is curtains lower to floor to cut out all light
Detail!!!!!  Such attention to detail is so impressive.  I so wish Ashville were closer to where I live.....
Talk to @sovietwomble @countdankula and @lazorpig . Some of my favorite youtubers who could use a room
Very nice
This is the dogs 👌😎😎😎😎
this is that ashville quality
I think it's safe to say he loves it 😆😆😆
The level of quality is amazing, and the workmanship is the same high quality.... You and the team smashed this one out the park Daniel 🙌😎💪
Damn.
