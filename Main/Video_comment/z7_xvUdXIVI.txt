The band and background singers make this song so great! And Harry’s vocals are crazy! ❤
But .. this was... bad?
This song its in my tune phone cell ❤
Спасибо, очень понравилось. Постоянно гоняют по нашему местному радио.😇💋💞💟💓💝💝💝💝💝
The mixing is awful
How can anyone not be attracted to this man I just don’t get it!!
Demasiado corta la canción para lo buenísima y espectacular que está 😅
I’ve loved this man since 1D to watch this man as we grow up together we are the same age by the way is completely amazing and unbelievable my dream is to finally see him in concert and meet him someday might have to do make a wish or something I’m so desperate!!
:>
great great soul song but its not me woman are deceitful but great song and im a songwriter. Killing superman listen
Beautiful to hear that he has vocal talent and doesn't sound like poo live.
THANK the Folks who work on the Beat and Music as well and the other Writers of the Song. They never get Credit.
WHAT A WONDERFUL SOUND THAT IS, EXCITING!

I’m a Harry fan except I like the fact he is extremely handsome in style especially in rubber suits but the hair style would matter if you like Harry Style Merry Christmas December is a winner since he looks pretty much everything I love him so much I didn’t take it economics? I mean this as an adult we have the most successful people in disguise but we don’t ever really so much I appreciate you YouTube The Creator @YoutubeTheCreator is my friend
Amazing love it 💯❤️‍🔥💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻❤️‍🔥🎶🇺🇸🇲🇽💖

Ele é maravilhoso...e que banda...show!👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Joji sung it better

What an artist my friends.
This was the song that made me realize i can mimick singer voices and its been so fun bing able to sing songs how they sound.
Amoooo 💜
This band needs to stick with him....they are so connected to each other.  But I suspect the blonde keyboarder and the drummer are behind all the creative arrangements.
Loveeeeee😍😍😍
Lowk really funny that Sabrina did this first
He is giving me some bowie / prince vibes
The fucking groove, love it!
He has a great band too. ALL of them🎶🎵🎶🎵💕
AMAZING!! I'm over 50 and started listening to him with my teenage daughter.He's really cool and talented! Great band 💕💕💕

Blue pill man

this song enter in my mind and I think I can't more drive my car without it in my ears . Love you guy
Such a voice - such a vision - such a vibe with his band - so much warmth and fun, so enchanting and talented and charismatic and beautiful inside and out - ok I need to stop! I don’t know what’s happening 🥹
Harry styles with a song something from the 80s, good song
Total 70s
vaya aún existe  buena música!!!!
Harry como me encantaaaaaas
Amo Harry Styles!
Harry's hit a new level. both vocally,  and as an artist expressing the Now . Breath control,  technique , everything has gone skywards. (Whoever he voicetrains with--- keep them!  never let em go )  Love love love this album . I'm sooo happy for him , and love his band as well
Amo tudo isso
Top demais
How could anyone be feeling down when they listen to you Harry?!!!!!
i just want to make out with my bf and listen to this song
Love it - the band is awesome!
Slayed. Said “yes” out loud when the band continued on. So much room to play around with this piece. Could easily run with two minutes or so of instrumental improv.
Wooow  so wonderful and magic
What name for bassplayer?
Most beautiful soul in the world!<3  :D LOVE YOU #HS #HarryStyles <3 xoxo God bless you and your band mates mate!
Amazing performance....bufff...i love that....musicians GOT swing...choirs perfects...and Harry level leyend
Alguém sabe onde vende essa camisa que ele está usando?
meu amor...
Goddamn Harry
Harry styles go go sleep🥱🥱
I would love to sing with him some day, and after I get over my fear of singing in front of an audience that is, yeah imagine I have a great voice and I'm afraid of singing in front of people, what a waste right? 🤣🤣🤣
That Kathy Burke can turn her hand can’t she…
Damn...that drummer,  amazing
🔥😍
I'm so beyond proud of him 😭❤️. He went from a 16 year old boy who had no confidence to this gorgeous 28 year old man who has all this confidence. And he's never really strayed from who he is.
W band
He gets lots of help from the studio and his producers to sound amazing on his records but he's enough of a magnetic performer that one can almost forgive his limited vocal ability when singing live
mhhhhh the refrain sounds very familiar to me https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx-2-EXVRkzw03yyoYzfu87Bb8RvB7Y-cj
OMG you are  Wonderful I am your fan younger fan and writes it on my dad's account But believe me I and my family love you we have T-shirts mugs with you and draws you in general I do not know if I will be at your concert in Poland because I have a dalego and so I am with Polish and my name is Karolina and my sister Magda I love you very much and we greet you very much. 🥺🥰😘 Buziaczki.
Style doesn't suit him.
Things haven't been quite the same There's a haze on the horizon, babe It's only been a couple of days And I miss you, mm, yeah When nothin' really goes to plan You stub your toe or break your camera I'll do everythin' I can To help you through If you're feelin' down I just wanna make you happier, baby Wish I was around I just wanna make you happier, baby We've been doin' all this late night talkin' 'Bout anythin' you want until the mornin' Now you're in my life I can't get you off my mind I've never been a fan of change But I'd follow you to any place If it's Hollywood or Bishopsgate I'm coming too If you're feelin' down I just wanna make you happier, baby Wish I was around I just wanna make you happier, baby We've been doin' all this late night talkin' 'Bout anythin' you want until the mornin' Now you're in my life I can't get you off my mind Can't get you off my mind Can't get you off my mind (can't get you off my mind) I won't even try (I won't even try) To get you off my mind (get you off my mind) We've been doin' all this late night talkin' 'Bout anythin' you want until the mornin' Now you're in my life I can't get you off my mind Can't get you off my mind (all this late night talkin') Can't get you off my mind (all this late night talkin') I won't even try (all this late night talkin') Can't get you off my All this late night talkin'
I seriously don’t understand how people can not like Harry
Désolée  tu es toujours  dans mes pensées  .... ne me laisse pas  tomber  mon vieil ami  .j'espère  te revoir prochainement.  😘
Wow that’s tight
Listening to Harry's voice always comforts me...
drumer is hot
Harry lindo talentoso estiloso diferenciado simpatico Um dos melhores cantores de hoje
This whole album sounds so much better when played by Sarah's band - the album versions seem so stale in comparison.
Mds Harry eu te amo
He may be a weird guy with weird manners, but hey: what a performer. Kudos to the drummer.
what an amazing group of people playing and  singing this amazing song !!  so good !!
NEVER change your band!
Harry me recuerda mucho al vocalista de INXS Michael Hutchence
Está muy chula 👍👏👏👏👏👏🍓🍒🍉🍭🍬💐

I'm sorry but this bass guitar woman it's absolutely beautiful and musician!!

People with those tattoos look so dirty and disgusting to me.  That bet is bigger than he is.
Sou cadelinha demais desse homem, que perfeito! 🤩😍
Anyone else think he sounds a little rough at the beginning?
I don't know if its me but, Harry Styles somehow reminds me of the late great Robert Palmer; he may not wear suits like how Robert Palmer used to but just like Robert the guy just exudes COOL!!!
Mano, perfeito demais... 🥰🥰🥰
I love this live version!
voowww…! music forever!
Omg. This song is the best I can’t get this song out of my mind🤩
The band.... Sooooo goooooood
Looks like his monitors were messed up.
He is amazing.  I wanted so bad to not like him.  But just wow he is good.
SARA ♥

Gran tema, para las proximas generaciones atravez de la eternidad.
I was dumfounded that his singing live sounds almost exactly as it does over the radio Hellsnick yeal yall <3

Dammit Harry, release the hounds man. Stop dancing - you look like Michael Jackson on quaaludes; you don't have to move and gyrate unnaturally. Let the voice do it man. And find a way to quell the nervousness so you aren't afraid to hit the high notes. Cheers!
Heard this today for the first time and can’t get enough. This is it man. Love the sound.
Why do I always love the live version of Harry's songs!? 😭🥺
Te amo Harry Styles
Bello🥰
His voice is weak or the music is too loud?
اغانيك حلوه بس لو تاكل خرا وتوخر عن سوالف المثليه جان صرت خوش ولد
Amazing❤
Is the music much too loud for his singing or ... I don't get it. Sometimes he sounds amazing but this time very weak.
MY FAVOURITE SONG I CAN'T STOP LISTEN TO THIS SONG
THE BEST SONG FOR THE ALBUM
Loved song 🎵 and swing ✨✨✨✨
I CAN´T GET YOU OFF MY MIND♥
Honestly his vocals are totally marvellous.
ELIN AND SARAH SUPREMACY

hary style
I love women of his band, they are such talented musicians and add very good vibes to live performances.
I dance everytime l hear this song.
2:51
God bless yall❤️
He would never naturally style himself the way he does, he clearly has amazing stylists, can you imagine Artist's without the team without them? = Actual Stars.
You know it's a hit when the band is jamming to it this hard
I just heard this song on the radio and on first listen I was hooked. The happy vibes remind me of his early 1D days. Love it.
The drummer is sooooo cool
I’m an old 56 lol I love this kid and his tunes 🎼🥁🎸

what a band
So happy 1D broke up lol
Gotta really good group of song writers behind him, making some absolute classics.
👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻🎶🎶
My Amv: https://youtu.be/gl7VHPoaZqg
His drummer, Sarah Jones, is amazing!  Would he be this amazing without her??
I like how relaxed his voice has become,  it shows he's at peace and I get relaxed as well
I love Harry's band. They're tight and perfect fit for him especially the drummer who always groovin'. Such a good jam :)
LOOK'S as though the drummer has got COVID as the screen around her
The best track of the new album, I'm really in love with this song
I think I'm in love....
Best from the Album 💖
The musicians are great and they perform the song so well. The production is awful. BBC should definitely have the money to hire better engineers. Production and live mixing is flat and uninteresting. Way to not let the performers shine the way they could with better mics and mixing.
loved the vibe of this song
Yoooo it's that dude from Dunkirk again!
Tories out help Tom Walkers song get played!! https://youtu.be/APUCSWZE4TI
Ay, me gustó más en el disco, aca suena medio mal el audio TT
Brilliant!!!!!!!!
Me derrito con esta versión
lo que me mueve en mi caso harry con sus temas en mi vida cotidiana no es normal es una droga que me hace feliz cada día Te amo Harry
When I first heard this song I got instantly reminded of when my partner and I stayed up late talking to each other every night when we first met. These lyrics perfectly describe how we both felt talking to each other, just butterflies all around and just wanting so much to make each other happy. Now been together for over 3 years and living together ❤️  this song already means so much to me because of that 🥰
Amazing Number of Harry Styles!!! 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌🎉🎉🎉🎉
WOW! DAMN! OF COURSE! So, I kept catching bits of a tune n I fell in love w it but couldn't catch enoff 2 work out what it was until I did n WOW! DAMN! OF COURSE! MR HARRY STYLES! What beautiful music u make! Each song is different but so great, there's a tinge of sadness masked behind a charming moving beat! Love it! LOVE U! Thank u!
The bass 😭😭
Harry Styles MV pleaaase
I’m 33, and I freaking dig this dude, such a sassy, classy good piece of music. I didn’t think they made music like this anymore ❤️
My fav song in the entire album
a song that makes me feel comfortable<<33
The chorus is a plagiarism of Beverly Knight and I hope she's spoken to her solicitor #KeepThisFireBurning
I want to send this to someone. Because we are in different country now. Thanks, Harry ..✌️
um dos melhores clipes do Harry
Who was mixing this? Its all over the place
The lyrics are kind of like Frank Sinatra's "Call me"'. ;) Classy is nice.
Harry, I’ve arranged this for piano 🎹..hope you like it🎶 see link below 👇  https://youtu.be/eFRl8eI4x4A
Catchy tune...on a loop
Their clothes are kind of cool. The band were all wearing denim jumpsuits.
❤️🇧🇷
2:13  dude's having so much fun
omg the harry styles ad on the harry styles video
Best singer from One Direction love this and As It Was too both catchy tunes 🇬🇧🆒
Gem 💎
Qué maravilla!!!!! 😘😘😘😘❤❤❤❤
fave song on the album 😗😗😗
No words can explain how much i love this man! Naybody knows where is the tshirt from!!!?
This a perfect summer song for young love/ crushing/ really smitten vibes….😌💕💕💕💕 It’s like his music just puts you a special place of yesterday or “oh gosh in my mind if this really could happen, it’ll be like this…” positive vibes only
이번 앨범 내 최애곡... 해리야 내한 해다오.....
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I Love you 🍓
The band. 👌  the lyrics 🔥  HARRY 🥰 Harry's house is EVERYTHING xx
How disgustingly Cheerful and Ecstatic I get when I hear this song.  I hate it!!  Everytime hes voice gets raspy with that exquisite English accent - I passionately sing along.  Flippen refreshing!!
Harry Styles - Late Night Talking   Things haven't been quite the same There's a haze on the horizon, babe It's only been a couple of days and I miss you Mmm, yeah When nothing really goes to plan You stub your toe or break your camera I'll do everything I can to help you through If you're feeling down I just wanna make you happier, baby Wish I was around I just wanna make you happier, baby We've been doing all this late night talking 'Bout anything you wanna 'til the morning Now you're in my life I can't get you off my mind I never been a fan of change But I'd follow you to any place If it's Hollywood or Bishopsgate, I'm coming too If you're feeling down I just wanna make you happier, baby Wish I was around I just wanna make you happier, baby We've been doing all this late night talking 'Bout anything you wanna 'til the morning Now you're in my life I can't get you off my mind Can't get you off my mind Can't get you off my mind (can't get you off my mind) I won't even try (I won't even try) To get you off my mind (get you off my mind) We've been doing all this late night talking 'Bout anything you wanna 'til the morning Now you're in my life I can't get you off my mind Can't get you off my mind (all this late night talking) Can't get you off my mind (all this late night talking) Won't even try (all this late night talking) Can't get you off my All this late night talking
เพลงเพราะชอบมือกลองน่ารัก
😍😍😍
I love how they make the background a little different then it is in the album 💕
The Best artist in the world
greatest everrrrrrrr
I like how they started jamming at the end.
I don’t know why but I can feel that he’s true to himself whenever he is with fans. That makes me fall in love with him.
I cannot count the times that I played this song today😍
Harry gak pernah mengecewakan kalo soal musik mah, love you bangetlah pokoknya
I LOVE THIS SOOOONG!!! ❤❤❤
i'm simping hard for his drummer <3
This song gives me so much seratoin
Am I the. Only one who thinks Harry looks exhausted.  He always looks gorgeous so back off. I just think he never stops and when he does is he staying healthy? I get a little sad at some pics of him.
Un dueto con Izzy Bizu sonaría genial
SUPER PERFECT
Currently losing it at the auxiliary percussionist using the cabasa as a shaker and tambourine with FULL confidence
hermoso como siempre <3
literally, the best ...
HOW CAN NOT LOVE HIM !!
Can't get u of my mind literally the song😭
Great 👍🏻
His album sounds like so many other songs
hi Harry Styles I love your new album I think it is great keep up the good work love it you said it would be interesting and people should go and get it is one of the best
My favourite song from the album
arte
so iconic that i got the mfasr apple add right before this
😍😍😍 I love it
Harry's music is so sexy and so is he
Harry’s covers for bbs is masterpiece 💚
Damn guitar too loud!!!
I got a big ol' crush on that drummer
i love Harry Styles
This live version of Late Night Talking by Harry Styles is very enticing and pleasing to the music listening ears. I only wish that I discovered this seductive song sooner though better late than never.
This song is a masterpiece
Can’t get you off my mind
The drummer is gorgeous 😍 lol
<3
Love it
Seems impossible that this isn't heavily influenced by Andrew Gold, and specifically, 'Lonely Boy'. Harry seems to even adjust his vocals to similar to Andrews' to lend to the style of the music
One off the best singers around. LEGEND.
mitch is sooooo goodd.. Oh lordie
It looks like nobody told them they'd be on camera
The band is vibin hard! They sound amazing together 👌👌
ITS BEEN ALMOST 12 YEARS OF BEING A FAN OH MY GOODNESS. DOES IT EVER DRIVE YOU CRAZY? JUST HOW FAST THE NIGHT CHANGES!
Harry Styles one of the best singer in this generation☺️😎 Thank you for sharing your music.
Love love love 😍
Jake Sim pls do a cover for this plsss 😭😭😭😭 I'd literally be single for the rest of my life if you do
The lyrics are perfect
I am fan of the weekend but I have to say I still prefer these real instruments playing music.
Not a great song 😕
🥰❤❤
Want to know if Harry & Zayn are together now💚💛💚💛
The perfect mixture between: good vibes , instruments and beautiful voices . Amazing video . Love it
Harry i love you so much<3

I love this song so much I have to listen to it at school and I prefer this version then the other one but there both good

Does anyone know what happened to the original band members? From what I can tell only Sarah and Mitch are still here from the original line up. Was there some kind of falling out??
This song is great, just love it so much. Harry is the best
Eu amo essa música aff
the drummer having her best time ever
I literally can't stop loving this song 😍💘
So far this is his first song i thinks cool. This live? Even better!
So fire
Mi ídolo mi Rey
Sarah is just soooooo good

Is this sampled from Keep this fire burning by Robyn? :o
Reminds me of Lykki Li - I follow rivers
Te amo Harry❤️

Harry please release these live versions!!!!!
"Now you're in my life, I can't get you out my mind" 😊

EL PODER DEL GROOVE. AMO ESTA ROLA.
Best album so far, by far! Literally love every song on this album... one of the few I can actually listen to from start to finish without wanting to skip anything.
The drummer plays so fine ..and she’s mighty fine too
THE BASS SOLO
I don’t get it. Dude has no vocal range and has a very boring style. I.Just.Don’t.Get.It.
Damn, Sarah is something else!  Can’t stop listening to the album! So freaking good!
😮‍💨😮‍💨🤩🤩♥️
For me this song has similar harmony and vibe, as a song of Shawn Mendes "Lost in Japan". Just check it out > https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycy30LIbq4w
This is a beautiful performance 💯💯🔥🔥
Harry Styles leyenda viviente
I can’t stoppp dannnncing 🕺🕺🕺🕺✨✨masterpiece

Esta canción es mi favorita<333 Amoo muchooo<33 TE AMO HARRY<33
don't tweak harry's voice, if he has a beautiful voice we love him the way he is.
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
is it just me who cant keep his eyes of the drummer
this is my favorite from this album
Why is he always fidgeting with his sound pack and ear piece?? Maybe nerves or using it as a crutch...
I LOVE this song!!! One of my favorites off this album for sure
bad sound.. good song
I Love ❤️ you
one of my fav song from harry
I love music s2 s2
This song would be a radio hit.
❤️
That bass solo in the end makes me feel something

One of your best songs, but I want you smiling and having fun as I am when listening, Harry, please!
The drummer in his band absolutely kills it everytime! Easily one of my favorite things about his band. Nothing better than seeing a girl who can create sick beats.
Mil
Noventa e nove
Noventa oito
I Love him
I love that they gave a lot of attention to the band! Super talented individuals, I especially love the bassist ♥️
i fucking love Harry Styles
llegue tarde perooo se dan cuenta como el canta igual que en la canción? no necesita de arreglos en su voz para demostrar que es jodidamente bueno en lo que hace, me enorgullece decir que admiro y sigo a Harry styles desde one direction y lo seguiré admirando hasta que muera, sus letras merecen reconocimiento y mucho amor
Girl is killing that bass line!!!!!! Love this whole album, keep having fun and spreading kindness Harry :)
Perfect vibes 🥺

THE CHIPPED NAILPOLISH he's so cute

OMFG this outro !!!!!! I need this version on studio
Miss you more than ever.
Such a groovy song. I love the instruments
Brilliant performance
Harry and the song seem to be on the same track, and nobody comes out with Harry Styles' voice
The king is coming!  Please turn...   "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." Jesus Christ
This outfit omg, I want it I need it for myself just immaculate
👍👍👍👍👍
se la dediqué y le valió verga jajajaj :(
I love him
I love you Harry 🥺❤️
loved this album so much, although something in this version live is strange, or maybe is my mind...
he sounds even better
why is Lin Manuel Drake on keys??
I like his sound live more than on studio cuts. It’s deeper and more full? Not as hallow sounding. Sorry. I don’t know how to better describe it.
baby boy so talented keeps getting better and better and he becomes older.
The chorus reminds me of a song??? What is it???
OMG So Amazing! Watch this interaction between BLACKPINK and BTS on their success and PROUD to be Korean! https://youtu.be/aXaHB4gGAys
all this late night talking sometimes goes not as planned 😆  nice rhyme, great song
My favorite track from the album. Such a vibeeee!
He killed this performance, what an incredible band too! The whole album is just insanely good, not a single skip!
not me focusing on the drummer who can keep the beat and voice so stable
damn.
All albums are unique with very different music style... Love this album
Sounds a bit tired
that drummer is HOT
best song of the album 👍
i LOVE when artists sing live but for some reason I always wish the band was a little quieter.
our babe 😍
Why is the drummer surrounded by panneling?
this might be my favorite harry-era. he just looks so happy and he's glowing. so proud of him.
Not enough people are talking about that drummer - so good!!
The youngsters won’t know who I’m talking about but I get a definite Robert Palmer vibe off him, both in the tone of his voice and his effortless style. Both masters of their art 🥰
Who's that in the druuuuuuuuuuuuuuuums?!?!
Those panst are HUGE lol love them. Love this album as well,  can't wait to see him in concert in CHICAGOOOO baby😍❤🙌🏾
harry’s house really is the most amazing album omg
bbc 1 doing gods work as always
He’s easy listening too. It’s great stuff.
THE BASSIST AND SARAH JONES... DAAAMNN I LOVE HIS BAND
The entire album is a viiiiiiibe!
He makes me happier 😢
Taking a break from listening to Amber Heard’s annoying lawyers by listening to this😅
https://youtu.be/j8ac-I-n340
Estoy muuuy obsesionada con este tema
Late night talking me alegras los días
Check out Martin Pettit great Live Webcam of Eastbourne Seafront https://youtu.be/84Eq5lbgKwQ 🇬🇧
I can't study it's stuck in my mind 😩
Me encanta
the pianists in harry's band looks like Drake.
Horrible
I like this 80s style. :)
the mixing is really weird in this video. The vocals sound really isolated
Me to this song, "I can't get you off my mind"
umieram, rozkoszne! <3
🌼🌈
Harry te amo como no tienes una idea!!❤️

Awwww

TE AMO MI AMOR
Anyone remembers the Brothers Johnson? This track samples from them (ain't we funky now) . They were an amazing funk group of the 70, & 80's......
This songs is very similar to Duran Duran's, James Bond theme... A View to Kill...
La voz de Harry es tan Preciosa
the "mmyeah" makes me feral.
FAV SONG
Drummers should never accept to play behind polycarbonate glasses. This singer should have a discussion with Elvin Jones of what should be drums in music.
Ya urge otro álbum
what's his real name?
🇧🇷 ele é incrivelmente talentoso. 😉
Wonderful ❤️😊
Nunca me cansare de decir que amo a harry
Te amo harry
Lo amo
Is it Drake on keyboards?

Estudio comunicación y lleve un tri con manejo de audio y déjame decirles que los niveles están malísimos :/ tienen una ganancia de los instrumentos  muy por encima de la voz 😔
Women musicians 🔥🔥🔥😍😍
Think the instruments are too loud  tbh
This song 🎶✨🎶
❤❤🎶
Mantap mamank suheri
Lovely
Why am i having deja vu?
I came across this song inside a H&M store. What caught my attention was the melody. Very Prince/Stevie Wonder vibes, I guess that’s why I like this song.
YEAHHHH
This is the best song on the album I can’t deal with this
Late Night Talking is one of my fave.  But why Sarah inside the glass? Hehe
The best one!!! Ufff 😮‍💨❤️❤️
I can't describe how amazing his band is! Sara and Mitch 😍
https://youtube.com/shorts/ZbiZpQF7Gts?feature=share
Such a good version 😍
If this doesn’t have a music video set in an 80’s club with a couple falling in love I’m gonna be sad
Todas as músicas
This man won’t leave me alone 😭😩❤️
This is a classic song I can see it
lindo
what is he constantly adjusting on his in-ears?
harry’s house is the best album
I just know charlotte would be killing it had she been here !

Loveeee the ending they do for the live version of this song 😍😍
Turn Harry up!! The instruments & background vocals are drowning him out a bit.. Other than that, it's beautiful.
Harry, sorry for that, but I love Yoy 💕 I love Your miusic and Your personality. Thank You for this music journey. This is so great. All the best mu Dear 🥰

I just wanna make you happier, baby We've been doing all this late night talking Bout anything you wanna till the morning Now you're in my life I can't get you off my mind I never been a fan of change But I'd follow you to any place If it's hollywood or Bishopsgate, I'm coming too..... I'm love with this wonderful & incredible song. ✨🎤🎶🎵🔥💞💞💞👌👍  And I absolutely love this beautiful studio version. 😍✨🎤🎶💞💞💞👌👏👏👏
everything about this video is perfect. wishing i was the mic once again
so cute
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
eu te amo
His band looks like they're having an absolute BLAST - like they're all just a group of talented friends jamming - I love it!!!
Me hubiera gustado que Harry hiciera más notas altas.
Muito bom gostei 😃
my favorite song off the new album
BRAVOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
We all need this song is coming out like a hit single
I'm actually so ticked that this song doesn't get the recognition that it deserves.

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3

He's very bold to sing live.
🥰🥰
It's incredible the way his music has evolved trough the years
Incredible 1:38 omg the dance 💚💚💚

Have loved this guy since I was 16... A decade plus later and it's surreal to see him still being the artist and performer that he was born to be
WE LOVE U H
I think the girls blouse suits him better.
This can be a single on record 7"
This is fresh 🧊🐬
I LOVE YOU SO MUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Mi ídolo mi Rey 👑

Seems like 70s revival? This another version to listen to on my playlist this song could of have solo on the guitar through a wah pedal with a exception could of been like outro 12 seconds solo since it's a live version. Te isolated bass part gives it a sign that this could be a little different live that should be the whole purpose. I would incorporate another guitar for solo purpose and melody though give it a warm tone jazz/blues feel something like Peter Frampton
OMG my jam. I love you, Harry
damn, he even got lil nas X in the back
Why BBC radio lives makes every song better?
my favourite off the album!!! it's on repeat!!!
SARAH JONESSSS MY GIRLLLL <3333!!!!!!
His vocals have improved so much over the years, and he also became really confident with himself. I'm so happy to see the changes and improvements over the years, ever since he was in the band.   Keep going Harry! ❤
😩💋🫀
love uuu
Another Freemason
❤️✨ Mi Peludito,Te Amo!Tus canciones me tocan el alma
The vibes are immaculate
the fits are killing me😩😩
from coachella experience- this song was actually the highlight of the show to me his vocals felt more natural as does this version as well but the studio version sounded a little bit pitched up just by maybe  +1 semitone. It’s still a good song but this is definitely a song for live performances.. that’s what i appreciate about harry, he knows how to put a show for many to enjoy.
loveyou much, H. ♥
Qué sería de mí sin vo
Amo todo, Harry se escucha cómodo
Increíble
He’s so talented
Eu amo essa versão
Is it me or does he have the coolest looking band??  LOVE HIM, btw. Me and my 8 year old son are new fans
chef's kiss
BBC ah!!
I like this song 😍
the trumpetssss ! TnT
TE LA DEDICO CARLA ESTRADAA
Drummer is having an absolute BLAST and I love it!
His vocals babe
Repent to Jesus Christ  “Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.” ‭‭Colossians‬ ‭4:6‬ ‭NIV‬‬
Harry de verdad muchas gracias por darle sentido a mi vida, gracias por estar en ese preciso momento en el que necesitaba una luz que me guiará hacia ti, claro que la felicidad tiene nombre y ese nombre es el tuyo, por qué cada que sonríes, estás feliz y divirtiéndote el mundo a tu alrededor cambia y se ilumina de una manera tan bonita que solo tú puedes hacer<3
This should be the next single
I love how everyone is vibing in the video. It makes it 100 times better!

Jesus is coming soon!  Please repent of your sin and turn to him.  Jesus died on the cross, was buried, and rose again  third day, in fulfillment of the scriptures.  He loves you and wishes that none should perish.  He died so that we may have life, eternal life in heaven.  Read Romans 10:9-13 for starters.  Believe in your heart who Jesus is and what he did for you.  Are you paying attention to what is happening in the world??  We are at the end, Jesus is coming.
YES
In the dating game, as soon as we leave, memories slowly fade, and new flirtations arise.
I've been listening to Harry's new album for days. These songs bring out the feelings of joy, sadness and longing in my heart and let me look into them. They are all beautiful, soft, cheerful and wonderful works of art. I'm really happy to know singer Harry and appreciate these great songs. I hope Harry will live over 100 years and be my star.
Me to this song : can't get you out of my mind
Satellite would be great live
is that drake on the keyboard
I’ve been doing all this late night listening, and now this song is in my life I can’t get it off my mind. I won’t even try to get it off my mind.
pqp to surtando
thank you harry
Can we please get the full interview/ set?
Ayyy this is such a vibe
eu acho q essa versão ficou melhor dq a de studio
❤️‍🩹
incrivellllll
This album is literally the only thing standing between me and graduating.
AMO O MAIOOOOR ❤️🇧🇷
Time is short   To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
ME ENCANTA
harry is a legend <3
SONG OF THE YEAR
One of my favs from this album
Can’t wait to see u in Toronto, Harry!!!
🕺
Hi Harry Styles I love your new album I think it is great and it specially I love the all night or song I think it is brilliant I can't wait to get it I'm all excited well done Harry he's done it again XOXO
He is just.. sooo cool 😎
😍😍😍😍😍👑👑👑👑🤟🤟🤟
Love this song soooo so much 💗
When the live version beats the studio record
Satellite pls!!!
te amo tanto
Wondering if I should save this to my playlist it’s so boring it might help with my insomnia 🥱
Magic❤😭
This sounds great. I am over the denim jumpsuits though on the band.
How's the blonde lady? Her make up is really cute
This is so fucking good🤭!
goooo mitch 🫶🫶🫶
his lyrics with his voice is really magnificent
why is the drummer behind the glass wall both here and on Howard Stern? Is it because of the mics? just aesthetics? never seen this b4
Im addicted to this man ever since
Nothing will top late night talking at Coachella honestly the horns and trumpets just added so much to it  But this one is flawless as well  Hazza really out done himself with that album
a minha preferidaaaaa
Why doesn't Louis not get played on the radio. Liam, Niall, Harry but not Louis. Please explain to me what the reason for this is. He's selling out concerts. Isn't that enough. He has a huge fan group standing behind him. I think because of that very reason he should  has worked extremely hard to get to where he is today. Someone needs to start giving him radio time. I'm from Windsor Ontario Canada right across from the Detroit River. If it is being played on the radio I know I would have heard it.
i love this song
te amo, estoy orgullosa de ti
anyone else feel the robert palmer vibes ???
el más talentoso
Amo esto !¡!!!!! 👏❤️❤️❤️
Omg, such a good song!!
Louies de Louis tomlinson y Lalitas de Lali Esposito apoyando
it can be a radio hit soon 🤞🤞 I believe he chose it for next single and it's being promoted on the background a little, because I see its streams are a bit higher than the rest of the albums. It's probably because it's being suggested for playlisting more than other atm. Such a great song but tbh I thought they could release it as a single somewhere in November because it somehow has Christmas vibe for me, idk why))
I mean how is this possible every version of this song is better than the one before.. im so proud of him honestly he did great 🤍🤍
Rubbish where have all the bands gone? Wish I could travel back in time to the 70's now that's a decade for music!!!
This just makes me really happy❤️⚡️
te amo harry, estoy orgullosa de ti<3
He 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
that bass tho 💡
❤❤❤
Talented king

Amazing as per usual. Does anybody know why Sarah is behind a screen ?
Es un privilegio verte

The chipped Sprouting polish on his nails 🥺💗

Where is the lion ring??
This sounds so good live!
Just when you think Harry and the band can't get any better they go and do Live Lounge and absolutely smash it. I've got Harrys House playing on a constant loop in my head.
HES BACK
이 노래 너무 좋음,,
This is going to be a single, and Daydreaming too!
Love Harry, for sure, but can we also give a huge shout-out to this super cool and talented band? Way to represent diversity, Harry!
c'mon harry we wanna see you dance in that room!
harry te amo besame
bands with women 😍
HOW IS NOONE EVEN MENTIONING HOW EXACT THAT MELODY IN THE CHORUS IS TO DUA LIPAS LEVITATING ???? She must get some credit for this bruh
My 2nd  fav song of this album
tabang
Sarah has the best ponytail in the entire world.
It's a shame that while this song is so good the mix is so bad.
I don't ever want to see this freak again
This man is from another generation.
TE AMO MUCHOOO
This song gives George Michael vibes ....it is really an addictive song one will automatically start singing it after listening twice or maybe even once ....Haz has really grown not only as a musician , as a singer but also as a human being ...his confidence and accepting nature unintentionally gives millions of people the confidence to accept the way they are .... 💚✨
Wont deny to the fact that Sarah Jones is best drummer out thereeeee!!
Does he look a little down/exhausted as of lately?
i am obsessed with his voice
ok this outfit tho-
I'm a huge fan of Harry. He's such an original and unique artist
Ooooh they’re finding the song. This is the fourth time I hear it live and this is the best so far. It’s really fun watching him evolve the live performances with the bad until their perfect. I think a lot of it comes down to him no longer having nerves about singing the new stuff and you can see he’s pretty chill here 💕
He's better than whole Direction
mi canción mi canción
AAAAAAAAH TE AMO QUE HERMOSO
invite 5sos pleaaaaaaase
slay
best song on the album.
He doesn't have his lion ring???

Loml
I can't get this song out my mind... ~~
Te quiero mucho Harry.

señor yo me voy a casar con usted
I wish this album was less synth heavy. I find it distracts from both his voice and song.  Love Boyfriends and the cover he did though!
This sounds so 🔥🔥

This whole vibe is just perfection

If the effect of Harry's music upon the mind within the moment of transference can transform it as I believe it does, then the world is blessed to have such an Artist inhabit it; an Artist who is golden through and through.
