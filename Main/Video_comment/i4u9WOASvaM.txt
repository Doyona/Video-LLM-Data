Am I the only one who was hoping it was the *other* spiderman 2, the current one is great tho!
6:37 67
Stop the mj missions man, wtf
Not better than Spiderman 2018's story and gadgets. Just my opinion
I would also say this Spiderman 2 2023  it's better than Spiderman 1 2018 game I agree with Bryan.
Obligatory give the casting director a thousand medals comment.
Sorry, the combat and swing design is incredible, but the story in the first one was incredible, that ending was the most spider man could be in the first one. Not saying the story on the 2 is bad, just the the fisrt one is miles better
"Intihar" in Arabic means suicide
After seeing the performance on PC this video hits different  Give us a good update man not every pc player is able to play ur game
Please give us the Great web DLC
Everyone agrees in the comments, so relieving to see that. ❤
Games journalists have zero merit as a creative writer other than how hard they stretch the imagination and downright lie to push a narrative, wonder how you got in! Gonna hire sweet baby inc to help you rewrite the french language next time too?
Bring it to pc so i can experience it😩😩
Hey Spiderman  wheeljack made that Spider that bit you he lost it
Spider Woke 2. Too many mental illness.
HE SAID IT, HE SAID THE THING
5:54 lmaoo
SM2 is easily one of the greatest games ever created.
Yes Metroid!!!
It's would have been awesome to give of 2 hero archetypes to create to different stories lines no for good and one for evil with both characters a mortality system in the game where u can choose to be good or evil that way we could of chose to except a symbiote suit for miles plus more villains with powers because both spidermans were op the was the only thing that made prototype boring you were on god mode and not enough powered up enemies to face with power on your level
These are the modern age rockstars we need, legends creating cool art for all of humanity to enjoy, as long as you can afford a PS5 that is.
2:42 we want to go even bigger❤❤ with the suits.. Bryan you legend
My man is buff
5:13 Combat wise the game is great, story wise: The game lacks emotional weight, good pacing, and is very underwhelming in some of the choices for the story.
The video gaming industry makes more money than film, music and TV combined
Optimized? This MF could've given us more Venom gameplay but nah, why do that when we can be an unsufferable and fugly MJ
F U
2:07 always pair with songs teams
Dont forget this is the dipshit director who heard the criticism of the MJ missions but instead doubled down to force players to play more MJ in a superhero game. Sweet Baby Inc. mustve had him in a stranglehold.
Without John Bubniak your game is worth very little. that guy was amazing
So he was a journalist who became a videogame director. Really? And here I thought I needed to do a bachellor degree on game design, haha. Guess I can achieve my dream even if I start as a simple digital illustrator.
It sounds like he should be on “Smiling Friends”.
“Brought to you by Sony!”
I feel like there was a moment when the narrative was Spider-Man 2 the game wasn't that good. I don't get this negativity. The game while it be story, gameplay, graphics, traversal are some of the best I've ever seen. Love seeing the director be passionate.
I don't think you understand how important mobility is to the spiderman games.... Spider-Man 2 for PS2 got that down to a fault... the last game felt nerfed comparatively so here's hoping the new Spiderman 2 will outdo it's previous production
Wuz Miles Morales kangz?
This game needs I choice system like 2 sons and an alternative power skills for the bad choices where u can help venom and add other heroes to go against if u choose to bad bad with either character and let us choice if we can be good or bad with venom with added on content would be so fire miles also needs more and better bioeletricity abilities where he can interact weather and everything electrical even go and electrical power up surge like venom surge
@WIRED amazing video 👍💪💪the quality of the statue is good or after a long time venom will bend???
Spider-Man 2's story was amazing. Venom is my favorite villain/anti hero ever so any inclusion of him is always a win. On that note, please give us a standalone venom game! 🙏   Additionally, as free/paid DLC, please give us a buffed version of a venom/anti-venom suit for Peter to wear throughout New York City. Ideally, if the player chooses to play with the venom suit (instead of the anti-venom suit), let his anti-venom attacks be colored black to reflect the color of the suit he is wearing.
Why did you silence Black creators like Cyael?
He is everything that doesn't need to be doing anything in gaming period
Loved this. He seems awesome. I got to say, the story of this game felt really like a GAME instead of a film game like the first games (also awesome) stories, so playing through felt incredible (I platinumed it on the day of this comment). I will say, combat was amazing, symbiote surge was bloody brilliant, suits were INCREDIBLE but I feel that the cooldown based combat was a bit less fluid than in Mile's game and the gadgets seemed a bit meh compared to the first game. Did love web grabber and ricochet web, don't get me wrong, but I missed the impact web so much, and the cooldown abilities/gadgets seemed like you had full on instakill instead of working through enemies to build finishers like the other two. BUT parrying was hella cool, felt amazing, and the blocking with the healing was so much better, the risk/reward way of having to have a full bar and waying finisher vs heal was super cool. And obviously, the traversal is MAJESTIC. Insomniac, you are truly amazing, and I'm so happy you haven't fallen down the rabbit hole like other AAA companies.
This guy is my new favorite person.  I just got a PS5 for Christmas, and I've got a lot of catching up to do on games.  So far I've clocked almost 50 hours on Spider-Man and it has been a revelation for me.  Knowing that I have Miles Morales and Spider-Man 2 waiting in the wings brings me immense joy.
I’ve only ever played the Spiderman 2 game on the Gamecube. I had no idea what I was doing, except I really enjoyed web swinging and crawling on buildings lol
design wise its cool venom personality and character wise no this is not venom
He said it!
As a Nintendo gamer who bought the PS5 just for SM2, I like the shoutouts/respect to the NES
once venom arrived in the game it became a horror story and i loved every minute of it!!!!
I know it isn’t supposed to be exactly like NYC, but I do remember playing the game when my dad asked me to go down a couple of streets that had the exact same look and stores as the did when he was a kid.
The only problem with this venom is he's immune to fire, witch is supposed to be one of his weaknesses.
I was blinded when I got the mouth-watering experience that is…        19 inches of Venom😈
cool
I could play a spider-man game where i log on & just patrol & run into random crimes all day. Just villains wreaking havoc. The development team could just load up villains missions every so often. There are plenty of spider-man villains to keep it up
I havent gotten a new console in almost a decade but if Sony keeps putting out new games like this, i might just have to get a PS4 lmao
I love Spider-Man and so having Lizard and Venom and Kraven throughout the main story was so great and fun, all the stuff with Harry and Peter was also awesome (and sad). But some of my favourite parts of the game weren't to do with any of that, doing the Howard mission with Peter almost made me cry, the cultural museum mission with Miles was so amazing. Playing as Hailey and connecting with the graffiti artist or finding the old man and listening to him tell the story of him and his wife - it waa so nice seeing a different side of the city and doing things that weren't just fighting bad guys or super villains. It was a reminder of *why* the spidermen do what they do, and *who* they do it for
*19 INCHES OF VENOM*
Ask why he gotta put all this anti Christian woke lghdtv propaganda in the game forcing subliminal messages onto kids
The looks like the long lost brother of James Gunn
This is the best spiderman game there is. My favorite spiderman story outside of comics
I had my problems with spider-man 2 but seeing the love he has for it makes me appreciate it a bit more. I know there was a lot of love in it and you can see that
Hot take: the webwings are cool but I don’t like the wind tunnel mechanic. It should just be usable webwings if you’re in a high building that helps you glide further. The problem now is that we can’t go back because it will feel very slow on spiderman 3. Same with the symbiote/anti venom suit. We can’t go back to weak spiderman with barely any abilities while miles has all the cool moves
Shame nobody asked him why they were so lazy making it
He isn’t.. but ok…
It can’t be the best Venom.  It’s not even Venom.  It’s Harry pretending to be Venom.
Spider-Man 2 wassss freaking amazing. the details where amazing its legit a movie it wasssss just so fuuuuuun play😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why is there so much political garbage in an otherwise decent game?
I just beat the game I absolutely love it game of the year.
Wow, I didn’t know he was the director. I remember when he was working. At 1up, I love it when passion for something shines through
Says: "If you like the villains you'll be rewarded"  First MJ mission: learn 3 of the die lol  Also how are you gonna tease the Agent Venom fit with Harry's suit and dont give it to us as an outfit???
spend less time patting yourself on the back and more time actually making a good entertaining game instead of refusing to listen to your audience
Why did y'all put BLM in the game?  Why did symbiote MJ complain about Peter when they were fighting?  Why are you dumping Spiderman for Miles for future games? 🤣
This guy rules
That's last part hit hard...
Dead game
Guy is a woke weirdo
“Why do you feel pressured to include LGBT storylines and characters in all your new games?”
When it comes 😂 to marvel 😂 everything starts 😂😂😂 with story 😂😂😂😂😂. Spider-Man video games are killing it though.
0 rewards 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's not, sorry to all the people who think it is for some bizarre reason.
The best feeling looking and playing spider man game ever. So stoked. I beat it platinum and need a new game plus asap as well as DLC can’t wait for updates and news
I wish someone would've asked him if we're getting playable allies in the next game. That's really the ONLY thing this series needs
We need yearly sequals
My main question: where is the sensational suit and superior MK1 suit? Lol
He is so right 8:05 The character switching and fast travel are so fast I have never seen anything like it
Wings were kinda weird, other then that awesome
Amazing game can’t w8 for the next insomniac game
Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is boring game.
do you think Insomniac will survive turning woke, unlike all the others?
It's the best venom because it's actually Venom and not...something else.
I just hope we get to see the green goblin in dlc or the next game
this game is so bad
Just don't like the eyes. Same problem with movie Venom
Why do peters suits magically repair themselves in the middle of combat?
Why don’t we have free access to peters house, and basement/workbench?
Why, even on level 60 (Max, I believe) do I have to beat down on bad guys for five minuets just to fill one focus bar?
Why is MJ so disgusting?
Quick question, Is the guy who's responsible for MJ?
Tell us about Wolverine story and production how it's going on?
The plot is so good and characters are so incredibly well written that I don't want this game anymore
I was head held high with the old ps1 Spiderman game featuring the Fantastic Four as my all time Spidey game. This beat that by miles.  *bah dum tiss*
I really want the game but it would be 609 dollars for me
Bring back the social feed man symbiote peter responding aggressively on twitter and miles telling him to chill in replies would have been hysterical
I just got jumpscared by me being in the video
I would still put PS1's Spiderman 2000 as the best venom.
Such a humble guy thank you for all games 🎉
Working at insomniac has been a dream of mine ever since I was a kid playing spyro, im glad this studio is still going strong, and working on my favorite super heroes!
What is Twitter?
This is the man that ruined a franchise
Venom design, gameplay..game is really awesome but Venom was the weakest link to the story. No communication, struggle, relationship between harry and symbiote was shown and Venom had no individuality. 90s animated spiderman and spectacular spiderman succeeded in depicting venom's personality and its host at the same time
Ever since I saw the clip of him saying they made MJ Scream only because she has red hair I’ve legit lost all faith 🤣😊
So will we eventually give credit to Donny Cates and Ryan Stegman for creating all the Venom lore and designs that Insomniac essentially stole to make the game?
This guy looks kinda like a Peter parker
Question: when will the next resistence be released
I Have Suit's For Both Miles And Peter On Spider Man 2 All Suits All Styles
I love how no one call twitter “x”. Elon Musk threw such a fit about it months ago, and nothings changed lmao.
This game is trash.   It's a $70 struggle session.
first i wonder are MJ sick and have the mumps or did she get stung by a bee? and then I just want to know would you include the Saudi arabian patch over here to?
Love how transparent he is… mentioning Nintendo numerous of times crediting his roots despite the fact that the game is a PS5 exclusive.  What a master piece of a game
Please do better on Spiderman 3. No woke bs! Or pride shoved down our gullets!! It's a marvel fantasy game it's supposed to be a source of escapism!! Don't flood it with propaganda and woke culture ffs
I just hope the bring profiles back in Spider-Man 3 ik it’s minor but I actually enjoy reading those
The game should be called Pandermen 2 genders
woke propaganda
This is what happens when you assign someone who actually cares about the players and the authenticity of the story
Game is nothing but a bunch of pandering crap this guy is a clown and ruined Spider-Man just look at Mary man jaw Watson
Let’s all have a minute of silence for brain dead morons who use terms like “woke” without even knowing what it means in the first place…
It’s “woke” - 🤡
Why add the woke stuff though?
Miles is boring.
i prefer web of shadows venom, but this one is good.
Cant wait for a venom game
5:54 ; can I laugh in your face ?😂
Why'd you kill off all of spidey's cool villains
Why is there always rap music when playing as Miles? Are black people only supposed to hear those funky rap beats?
Generally think the Lizard design is the best ive seen in any depiction ever whether its Comic book, animation or live action
Brian, stop adding woke agenda into the games. It ruins the experience
Thank you Brian
Why mj is ugly ?
Bryan I loved the game. Platinumed it. But one thing that bugged me was that MJ was one shotting enemies that our Spider-men with electricity powers could not. I did enjoy the sequences but I can see why she was only in a few… that stun gun was OP!
Spider man 2 ps5 plates so rare he couldn’t get one for this video😂
The Daily Bugle needed a bigger role.
Your games trash
I would sell an organ to get a ps5 and play this game
I miss the Unlimited Suit, don’t know why I’ve always loved the design, always played the ps1 spider man with it
You had the world at your feet and you sold out to the woke mob.   You may have got your money for this game but all I keep reading and hearing is how people are unhappy with the game.   You chose to have us play as manjay and a death girl.  That’s not why we play Spider-Man
I'm hoping in the third one they let us do 2 webs at once when swinging and the ability to just hold on to the web and dangle. Like in Spider-Man 2 on PS2 you could be swinging on one web and the shoot out a second one and just hold yourself there and play with the physics of it. It's crazy how we still haven't reached the heights of that games swinging mechanics in 20 years
I enjoyed the game, Kraven and Venom were the highlights, however personally best venom will always be Brock as Venom. Also with the game once i finished it i didnt like the ending im getting the feeling Peter is going to get fazed out and replaced with Miles. & if so Spiderman 3 will be an easy pass. Also it would be nice if insominiac chills with some of the woke stuff. Im hoping theres zero of that in their Wolverine game next year, if not I may hesitate into buying it. Also bonus I liked the new combat abilities as black suit spiderman that was well done.
in my opinion in the term of character this venom is nothing compared to ps1 (2000) spiderman game..sorry
Here's a question: In the Spider-Man PS5 Remaster why are all the people around the hobo fires Black? Is it some DL racism?
Questions asked in this post is fluff, anyone sense a setup?
I wish we got the Spider-Man Unlimited suit :(
Why did you make spiderman 2 woke?
Man I friggin hated the Mary Jane sections. But I can’t lie, that last one was actually badass and fun.  SPOILER:      But being able to one-shot symbiotes was very satisphying. It was the one time MJ actually had advantages over the Spider-Men. I loved it and honestly want more now lol
Sorry but this Venom was such a flat, boring and one dimensional villain LOL. "lets cure the world"/ world domination and then being defeated by pressing the big button on the machine to shoot the laser in to the sky, so generic lol. Imagine how good this game wouldve been with a revenge-driven creepy/obsesed Venom/Eddie Brock who can sneakily creep up on Spiderman because he never triggers Peter's Spider-senses so the whole game you feel paranoid that he could attack you at any point.... mindless monster Venom is so overdone take us back to the emotion of the character that made us fall in love with him twice over!
Why is MJ much older looking and uglier than before? Why embrace the wokeness? Why do we need MJ to be stronger and powerful?
Make it online so we can web swing with other spider-men
Woke trash.
Man this dude looks huge
Yeah I loved this venom way better than the venom we got in the movies this one actually has some giant testicles dangling off him
I want MJ killed in Marvel's Spider-Man 3.
I honestly feel like spiderman ps1 is the best venom version. I like the seriousness and comedy he had at the same time. Kind of reminds me of joker.
Venom is so good because when you  get to play as him... you don't have to play as Mary Jane. 🤣
*Your Not Sam Raimi* !!!
I really liked the game but the woke garbage really made it so much worse
Ahh he was a”journalist”. That explains so much
The game is great but I wish the mechanics in swinging and what not wouldn’t hold your hand too much, IMO it doesn’t allow expression and freedom to the player.
I'm going to start calling "it" Venom  So when I do my thing, I just say "you're getting all 19 inches of Venom, all 19 inches" 😂😂
Woke director😂😂😂😂😂
Now that he mentions it, I am so glad that suit styles are accessed through the suit's main colourway as opposed to being offered in different suit slots. Thank you for not pretending they're different in any way past colour. Also: Give players a post-story black symbiote powers(?) Anti-Venom clashes with the black suit.
I 100% suits tech and districts I don't believe there is a mission where you go back and forth between both spiderman. So if did mission exists it really wasn't memorable.
Woke garbage
Bryan Initihar, I hope you read this, you are a true hero
It’s not. Eddie Brock is Venom.
not sure if every company treats their games like this, but this is a great insight about the development process. I love where he explained how the industry has grown and also focuses on player feedback even after the whole release
Came looking for FRAGILE EAGLE chants
Please ask him why they had to change the character's faces so often. We don't need a writer self inserting herself as MJ when her original face had already been established.
Is this dude Jewish?
7:22 And that ladies and gentlemen is why we get unfinished/unpolished games on launch. Funny he says evolved when it’s more like devolved🤦🏽‍♂️
But that’s the best Venom has ever looked
New spiderman was kind of mid
Be really cool if they have a suit designer like Tom had in his movie! Like imagine all your favorite parts to suits making it one
I get the sense that Sony had a lot of pull with the suits because the number of movie suits having their own slots without palette swaps (Raimi suits could have just been palette swaps, as could the MCU suits). Really limited the number of returning suits and potential new ones like the Ben Reilly, Blood Spider, Captain Universe, and Unlimited suits.
Great game but just wayyyyyy to short for a 70$ price tag
Nobody asked for free roam with venom? Really???
The traversal speed is insane compared to the first, going back and playing that feels so slow but it’s still a great game
best game
Me i have a question. Will marvel spider 2 game be on pc?
Make a superman game
I love this guy ! ❤️ thank you for this awesome journey
Started out as a journalist...  *That explains a LOT.*
One problem with this game Mr. Director, it’s too short, we want more, we want DLCsssss
This man is a genius
I am just disheartened that no one asked the most important question: when will it come out on PC :(
We love Spider-Man vs BIG Villains!!!
X-Box? Why not?
The side story missions  were mostly horrible but the main story was real good. All the venom stuff was sweet.
He looks like otto octavius’ son
Looking forward to the Wolverine game they are making
Why was the sequel "just more spider man"? No one is really talking about it no more.
Yes. Yes he was
Wokees game.
Not really, Venom is great because of his hatred of peter. In this game his motives are "i want to destroy the world" cliche. Third act was a disappointment.
Is silk moon going to be in marvel spider man 3
Marvel spider man 2 map was huge and i hope it will be bigger on marvel spider man 3
Ehhh idk the PlayStation for the game was a let down nothing exclusive about a plate I could buy at the store. I’ll let them say they made an exclusive controller but to say they made a console is a stretch
Cap, this is not the best Venom 🤷🏼‍♂️ Story is also mediocre, so many “wtf, why?” moments
Amazing!
I can see why he pushed for trying to make "MJ Stealth missions fun" and why the side missions pretty much were boring/too little before seeing the video lol. They could have cut things like that and the 15 minute "Play as Venom" session to make more side content so it doesn't feel like the game just ends at the end with no side content after the game.  Still, extremely fun game, loved playing it, can't wait for DLC.
this is my guy. WOLVERINE NEXT!
That "Last"... Answer. ❤️
Amazing game. Truly a cinematic masterpiece in its own right.
Dear lord no.  They shoehorned Venom into this game.  Ultimate Spider-Man did it way better.
Would love to be able to play venom in free roam
How does anyone play this game on fidelity mode? The 30fps is a game breaker. 60fps or bust
I ended up using the Tobey Maguire suit like the whole game
The only issue i really had with spiderman 2 was that Miles hardly interacted with Harry. Could have replaced any of those stealth sections with the spider bot and MJ and had Miles have mission with Harry. I didn't mind them just wish the two interacted more
should have had him answer the real reason they replaced the better VA for peter
Should of asked him why was peter badly nerfed in this game
I love this guy !
First game I ever platinumed
Hey, why does the game crashes in the first 2 minutes of playtime and can't go further? Issue CE-108255-1 unresolved!!!
Thank for still colling it twitter
Mans pulled out 19 inches of Venom and they didn't even blur it. Wild.
Someone should have asked about DLC
This guy ruined spider-man in his own way. Boring drivel
Ok why we got Cuban flags 🇨🇺 instead. Of 🇵🇷 Pr flags ???
My only gripe with the game was the missions were repetitive with so many waves of enemies I’d think I was getting the boss fight and nope it’s another wave of enemies 20- 30 minutes per mission is insane
Eh, venom shouod not triger tge spidersense...and no reason for it to not just be a peter and eddie game....idc for miles, ahd idc for a harry venom
Ahh it all makes sense now... He used to be a game journalist...
My favorite games right now Spider-Man 2 and Re4 remake! SM2 just on another level right now 👏
Lets hope insomniac's spell keeps going more and more
It’s not the best. It shouldve been half survival horror game and half spiderman 1. Venom being obsessed with peter wouldve made for a horrifying stalker kinda experience
hope to see spider gwen in dlc or new game.. :)
Microsoft was stupid to let Insomniac go such amazing talent
This guy’s surname literally means su*cide in turkish language wtf
Why is the game so woke and why did you remove the woke stuff for the Middle East and why does MJ face look like she was stung by bees?
Heh, bro said 19 in of venom
SOMEBODY BETTER HAVE ASKED WHY THERE WASNT 2 PLAYER
I enjoyed this, but I'll be honest, this is "Insomniac's Spider Man 2 Support", not "Video Game Support".  I know that, obviously this is a big, exciting release to capitalize on, but I must admit I was a little disappointed at how narrow the scope was.  I still appreciate the expertise and insider's view, though!
No questions about woke propaganda.... Biased interview... Unsubscribed...
19 inches is crazy😭😭😭😭
The person who asked about the game textures is delusional 🙄 plenty of low quality areas in the game. That was the biggest turn off for me
Would of been nice to have the ps5 covers but since the scalpers bought them all no one got any
love you bryan but please change miles’ new suit
Great video.
Dog. Just finished it 100%. Incredible game. Goty vote for sure. I know bg3, but I no lifed this game and still have yet to have the urge to finish bg 3. The performances, combat, plot twists including gameplay surprises. Just insane. I can count on one hand the number of games that l've had the urge to hand write fan mail, and this is one of them. Bravo insomniac.
Bryan and his team at Insomniac are absolute superheroes themselves for Spiderman and Spiderman 2. So stoked to see what they do for Wolverine and their Earth 1048!! ❤️
Really really liked how Spider-Mans suit started to look more like the venom suit after wearing it and being corrupted with it for awhile. Such a cool detail. Only critique I have of the game, is that there could have been more to do out in the world like the first game had. More side quests and side villains. Maybe cooler abilities for regular Peter too, the arms didn't do it for me. Loved overall though. Really hoping we get another dlc story like city never sleeps.
loved this interview! Had to buy Spiderman 1 to play on PC since i cant play the new masterpiece!  side note: 6:55 ACTIVISION LISTIEN TO THIS ANSWER
The original comic Symbiote Suit with the 90's style red and blue highlights was perfection!
All the missions as Peter or miles are annoying af.
I have a question: Will there be multiplayer in Spider-Man 2 PS5.
Man of the people 🥳
Why was their gender neutral language especially in the spanish version?
The answer for that last question, was absolutely marvelous
This game is one of those
Honestly the only problem with the game was I wanted to see kraven take down more villains on camera and venom needed more screen time
So everyone is gonna ignore that MJ a journalist took an entire base full of kraven's henchmen by herself 😂😂 with some "training" by sable
Venom with wings is the dumbest venom
You guys made a masterpiece ❤
Here's a question why have a side mission where you play as a random deaf girl spray painting in a game about spiderman?
I gotta get PS5 Slim for Christmas. 😙
Story shouldve been longer
We need a punisher game on ps5 :) good luck with the wolverine game jeje!
When I “became venom” I was like no fking way!!!!
Get woke, go broke.
I love Insomniac. Rachet and Clank is one of my fave IPs.
BUDDY'S ARMS!!!
Him and Cory Barlog are my fav directors
Maybe he can answer why MJ is so ugly now lol
1000th comment!
Thank You for your contribution to making such a delightful game.
Spider-Man 2 is my GOTY, the action, the story, the emotion, the web-wings.  Everything bout this game was perfection for me, and if you haven't played it yet best believe you are in for a real treat.
Why was MJ stronger than peter and miles combined? I mean she ko a guy with one kick
There’s nothing I want more than a daredevil game. Hope insomniac will make it one day.
I’m so glad he mentioned accessibility! As a blind gamer, I had no problem playing Spiderman 2.
7/10, 1st spiderman was better
So....they have a guy who worked on making the PS5 on their team, no wonder why their games are absurdingly optimised for ps5
Fragile eagle!!!
Suits we want don't get added, they make up random ones w/o back story.............lame
"Do you need to know how to code?" "no, i started as a journalist." talk about being unqualified
I had to pause at the part he’s talking about suits 😂. Idk if it’s just me but over half of them are just trash why would I want to dress Peter or miles as Kraven, mysterio, jazz musician, daft punk, etc… y’all did a good job on miles endgame suit besides the floating head through the “touching cutscene”. I loved the game and story though. 9/10. Don’t flex the suits though lol
Brian is a GOAT
Something I havnt seen much talk about is how much the impressive haptic feedback of the ps5 controller adds to the swinging and just in general.
He seems like such a bro
Jacked
Shoutout to Bryan and all of Insomniac Games for coming out great games for this console generation. Also, I agree 100% with Bryan's answer on "why are video games important?"
I'm gonna treat myself with 19-inches of Venom 💯
Bryan Intihar seems like such a genuine and down to earth guy, love that he’s in the role that he is. This guy really cares. Kudos brother
What a game.
Man I need a Playstation :(
you can tell he really cares aboout gaming and making the best game possible he says make the game playable for a lot of people he doesnt say make the game famous or smth like that you can tell they care about their fanase more than their pockets
The way they portrayed Venom in this game was the epitome of everything Venom should have been can wait for them to drop a solo Venom game
my favorite part was when mj gulped 19 inches of venom
I want Spider man 3
Check out my spiderman vids yall u wont regret it🔥💪🏽
Make more consoles and a disc based to sell! Dont let the scalpers take your money!
any comments on middle Eastern version? 😂😂😂
Why gall messed up the flag
Spider man became lgbt man.  Your agenda is not good.
Game of the year

What do you think the one piece will be?
This game needs to go on sale for less than $20 before I'd remotely consider buying it.
Take the Wokeness and the alphabet club out of the game like you did in the middle eastern version. It influences kids to be something they are not. Leave all of that nonsense to your personal life. People don’t care for that stuff.
1:50 PAAAUSE!!!
Bro got them 19 inches of venom arms
All i miss in the suits is the black and green stealth suits
Bro, King In Black Bro....BROOOOOOOO😬
tim sweeney really does everything
last answer too true man
Would love some behind the scenes featurette of this game.
Don’t get me wrong I am completely satisfied w the game but I feel like a perfect touch to the game would be different finishers some people may not know but you can fight with harry or yuri when you play miles also and I think it would’ve been cool if they had different finishers compare to peter
why do i sense that them's a they..
The only question we should be asking him is, WHY would you let them sneak WOKE BS into such a masterful game? 😢
Venom is so cool in this game!
Eddie Brock is Venom. ✌🏽
The best Venom is the one with Eddie Brock, period.
Tell Brian parker to add weather change!
I really miss the Big time suit for Peter, the best one imo, hope they add it later
With how much effort this man has put into this franchise, I really hope they put a little Easter egg in the final part of the story for him. I'm talking fourth wall breaking stuff.
Why is the game so short? Got platinum in 20 hours.. and the lack of enemies in the open world is so lame!!
He made sure he emphasized “all 19 inches of Venom”
They did Venom justice, but I still prefer the Eddie Brock storyline for Venom. Specifically Ultimate Spider-Man and the 90’s animated series. It would have been awesome to be able to play as Venom a little more as well.
This is the only company u trust with a $70 pre order
So freaking dope!!! Getting a ps5 soon JUST to play Spiderman 2❤
everything was a w in the game....except that 1 miles suit....n that "electric spider" incident
He fr looks like he sounds. When I heard him in the trailer, he looked like this to me lmao.
The man right there!
I say this in a good way, this guy looks like the type of guy I want to direct my game
See the GOAT love the GOAT
It’s too bad the game is polluted with identity politics and irrelevant perverse topics. You should have gave us an option to turn it off like a blood/nudity toggle in the options.
Yo Brian looks like Doc Ock wtf
7:50  Ok I just wanna point out for those who didn’t play Spider Man on PS4, the swinging was definitely not as slow as it was shown here 😂😂
no wonder the game is woke as f... seeing this white dude
His last remark legit made me tear up wow truly inspired
I have a question for him, Why does my copy contain this insane woke nonsense when the middle Eastern countries get one for people without mental health issues.
"over 200 suits" there is 72... lmao.
You are a lowlife, Intihar. You will pay for this
Should I buy the game? The first one had a good story and I did like it, but gameplay-wise it was too repetitive and kinda boring for me. Collecting bags, chasing pigeons, chemistry puzzles... Man, those felt like tedious chores than fun experiences.
Until we get New Game+  Manual Save at the start of the mission,  _"DON'T BE SCARED."_   You're welcome.
I trust this guy, he'scool af
There are some criticisms I have with the game but man what a great sequel. Great job!
Love the game 10/10 I’ll give 3 an 11 if they put Gwen in the game
If mark cerrny will retire playstation arhitecture is on good hands
Can he answer why pete struggles so much with villains he already dealt with? Don't give "experienced hero" that the story pushes. Especially once Miles becomes a things, pete just becomes a side character in his series lol. Power wise i mean
i love his enthusiasm. he clearly cares. i just don’t love Insomniacs Spider-Man as much as i hope. i expected greater, still it’s good. really good at times💯
how do i become a creative director? it’s my dream job
Bring on Spider-Man 3 with green goblin, carnage and silk
I really really hate that it forced miles to wear that awful new suit no matter what I did for the final mission. That is AWFUL. Wannabe Wally west lookin weird non-Spider-Man lookin suit. The red and black suit works. It works for a REASON. This dude should not be creative director…
The story of the game so poor, especially the second part. There is no sense in a dialogs - just random words without any means. Why you did this? What happened during development?
Listen to Friends Per Second for more of this!
They fact this guy calls different color suits 200 bar is set so low now and days
dude looks like Peter Parker in his 40s
MJ took 19 inches of Venom. Look at the scene when Harry was Peter's house. After Peter was stuck under the fridge, Venom took MJ and was made to go down. 😏
Great game. Wonderful traversal.  Sick of the woke agenda. Didn't want to play as normal graffiti vandal. Im sure the blind community really appreciates the inculsion of blind people in the show/comic/game they never see/play........
Hey you did a great job on Venom but I honestly think you could have done his head better, ala Alex Ross or Mark Bagley style. Please check those out. When you have this comical tiny round head it is nowhere near as incredible as what Venom is 'supposed' to look like. Essentially a HR Giger inspired alien-head with angular dinosaur mouth. Not a bowling ball squished head with a dinosaur mouth. Check out Alex Ross and Mark Bagley's Venom art.
Repent and believe the gospel! Jesus did for our sins and rose 3 days later so we could be forgiven of our sins and be gifted with everlasting life. Put your faith in Jesus and follow him. Life is short please make the right choice today.
give me dlc NOW
Why did you add all the weird gender flags in the game? Pandering? Virtue signaling? All of the above?
im glad sony wanted to do a ps5 spiderman bundle 2. i preordered mine the day it was available.
They should have saved anti venom, scream, carnage and venom trying to take over earth for next game, I think they should’ve just gone for like a simple venom kidnaps mj, kinda like spider man 3. They kinda did a bit Much in my opinion
I don’t know if this will make it to the team but if so THANK YOU. I appreciate you providing this type of experience for a second time. Games like this & God of War are why I purchased this system.
game is great
That was a good video
Jeff Kaplan
HOW COME NOBODY ASKED ABOUT SPIDERMAN 3 ?????!!!!!!!!1
Man, as a personal underrated highlight: The last Howard pigeon mission really hit me in my feels
Thank you Bryan, thank you so much for being a part of giving us these incredible games!! You guys are the best in the business, by far.
this has gotta be at LEAST top three venoms EVER.
I enjoy these Marvel Spiderman games as much as I did the PSone Spiderman games
By the way Brian your game is woke  Took my copy back to GameStop and got my money back
My only criticism would be not including the weakness to fire
Oh look, The guy who doesn't listen to the fans at all... Crappy side missions (helping a guy ask out another guy...wtf kinda boring woke mission is that?) Also MJ mission again? Not only that but they double down having us play as miles deaf gf? They did that on purpose because they do not care about player feedback.
Sonys venom is a joke
11:57 He sounded so much like Peter Parker 🥹
Why ulgify Mary Jane and make her missions like she is robo Jane and can just run through bodies like nothing?
Why throw in all the woke garbage and ruin a good thing?
Playing as Venom for those 10 minutes really makes me want to play a solo Venom game ❤🖤❤️ (just give harry control again to make him a Antihero)
Marvel's Spider-Man 2018's Ultimate difficulty was a little straining, but overall easy for me when I had played it.  Spider-Man 2's Ultimate difficulty is definitely way harder, while still feeling fair (mostly lol).
(it's nowhere near the best venom)
I just want to be able to play with The Captain America suit again. Call me a cheater if you want to but that suit is why I LOVE the PS1 Spider-Man.
Love you Bryan thank you!
PlayStation has the best games to play like Spiderman 2 💯
game is great
1:51 💀
All game directors Need to be like this actually card about What they are producing and making
@jacksepticeye watch this
Bryan seems like such a genuinely good and passionate guy, both about games in general and very much about Spider-Man. I’m the biggest Spider-Man fan that I know, and I could not be happier that he’s the one overlooking this version of Spider-Man
Why are they forcing diversity and LGBT on us ?
The boss battles within this game epitomize a stark lack of creativity in game design. Repeatedly facing the identical character consecutively, devoid of any meaningful alterations, exemplifies a profound dearth of innovation. This conspicuous laziness underscores a missed opportunity for the developers to elevate the gaming experience.
the last question was so real
i sat down to eat breakfast and heard my name in the first few seconds of the video... i forgot that i even sent that tweet, how surreal!!
Why is the game shutting my whole playstation off every 40 minutes? It’s like it’s a power outage, it shuts off without warning whenever I play Spider-Man 2.
Is he rainbow colored?
Most of the suits were a hit but Miles' "new suit" was not. Hope that isnt his new suit in Spiderman 3
please ask him if Spider-Man 2 will come out on PC
I just got my platinum for the game. Love the gameplay, but it's very disrespectful to Peter Parker. What was made to Peter as a character in this game, should be considered a criminal. What baffles me is that it comes like this, after the utter prefection that was the script of the first game. Either way, it's a great fun game and I had a blast with the gameplay, but next time respect Peter Parker.
the random crimes are still kinda lame but i love the game sm
Insomniac should be the only studio for Marvel games.
Venom spinoff!
weird that they released this now when it was obviously recorded months ago
Black People are Awesome: The Videogame
The last question got so real that I love it sm 😭
10:47 Bryan Intihar is 100% going to add that feature in Spider-Man 3. You can see it in his eyes that he wishes he thought of that lol
Did they ask him “how come you guys released a woke game to us after years instead of releasing a genuine product? “ probably not
Why does peter feel so weak in this game?
How many people worked on spider man 2 game???
in the game it is 19 hundred in
Loved that we got side missions this time around that are actually relevant by introducing new villains, problem that they are all left on cliffhangers, I just hope we get some conclusion to those storylines in future DLC expansions instead of having to wait much more until the next game.
Great but when is it coming to PC?
8:45 anything we can do to make more people play our games.  Mmmhmmm.😂
Why is this guy so jacked
After Sony bought Insomniac, did Sony interfere with the development?
Best game ever !! I’ll take venom as a standalone game because that’s the best version of venom I’ve ever seen!
are we just skim over the fact this mf said "you get 19-inches of venom" ayoo?
Finished the game AMAZING GAME i am waiting for the DLC and new game plus
1:50 he said it! He said the thing 😂
Petition to have a bully maguire skin in the game 👍. Pls Insomniac!
guys tag insomniac we need a venom game or spiderman 2 dlc like 2018 spiderman had 3 dlc packs
W
I just hate how in the map harlem goes up to 138th and then it ends, because I live at 140th😭
This game is wonderful!  I dream of the day when we get a complete Spider-Man with Into The Spider-Verse animation, though. But for now, the suits are enough hehe
I wish the other symbiotts suits had black webs. Well, just symbiotic webs
Love the superior Spider-Man costume. I was hoping it was coming to the last one it didn’t, so I’m very glad it made it here!
This venom design is not the best design too me. My favorite design is maximum carnage series 1963-1997  Awesome looking one! This one looks like he need to fight hulk.
Story wise it's definitely not as good as the first game. It had a TON of "wow that's cool I'm surprised they added that" moments but it had several plot holes and felt very forced to me. It was also nowhere near as emotionally captivating as the first.
Very good video. Thank you for making it
grandpa earl had me in mf tears
Perfect!
What an awesome dude. One of the best wired guests yet! I’m not a superhero gamer but listening to Brian Intihar speak and answer honestly and with passion I just bought Insomniacs SpiderMan trilogy.
He looks like that overwatch guy
Why is he not using a VAIO?
I just platinumed Spider-Man 2 yesterday on my birthday!
I want rocksteady to develop spiderman and vice versa
Insomniac has the big talent and passion.
I love how they don't even acknowledge that it is called "X" now
Spiderman 2 is shaky at best, trying to add so much in the second half and didn't seem as intimate of a story as the first one
Just wanna give a big thank you to the entire team at INSOMNIAC.  You guys really delivered the definitive Spidey experience.  ❤🙏
It's a shame they didn't have Eddie Brock at least teased for dlc. I'm still hoping that the Carnage side quest sets up Eddie showing up and helping Peter investigate what Cletus is up to.
Nerfed Peter, buffed Miles
are u doing wolverine
Man I love insomniac
Man I love insomniac
I want better haptic feedback for the web swinging, it seems kinda lacking
👍👍👍👍👍
Its called X.
Please make venom game after spider man 2 the lethal protecter
i am inspired
is there a baxter building?
Bryan getting the celebrity treatment
I think Venom could have been a foot shorter, other than that, he’s absolutely perfect.
Y’all crafted a masterpiece 👌🏾
Thank you for yet again another incredible game, story, and experience! It was everything I could've hoped for! Y'all are amazing
Peter new face still weird, its like bootlef version of Tom Holland, thats only flaw of this game. Peter and Miles look the same age, what is the Developer thinking 😵.
I was really hoping for a more Peter focused game after the spin-off was so Miles focused, but I'll take what I can get I guess.
I liked the storytelling of 2018 more than spiderman 2. I can get over Yuri somehow fighting spidey, but I can't get over Kraven just immediately OHKOing Pete. Really didn't do a good job for that interaction or the rest of the Kraven buildup. Way too much off screen stuff for Kraven and the other villains.  It was a lot of fun overall, but I'm a big story guy and the story was pretty flawed at major points despite some of the very cool variations on the traditional characters like Venom.
What if we could use suit capes as wings?
Okay venom as a design 10/10, but his character was mid…  -he count him and his host US son/friend or whatever too much.   -I don’t know even know why he left the meteorite when he know there two Spider-Man like I know he want Peter but still  -powerhouse but at final boss we’re were taking turn fighting venom as like they’re fine on there own. Like thought venom was able to take on both of them at the same time to show his power but barely. Like they did the fight back meme on him, no intense fight.
why was venom fully evil?
My only complain about the game is why i can't do SLINGSHOT while on wall of the building. I have to run all the way up of the building. 😢
MAKE VENOM PLAYABLE IN FREE ROAM! I WILL PAY 100 DOLLARS JUST FOR THIS!
One of if not the best open world game i have ever played. This game is beautiful the story is great being able to glide into those wind tunnels feels amazing in short i love this game ❤ 👍
Everything about the game is amazing, but one thing is missing for me, Web Blossom Suit Power... WHEREEEEEEEE?! :(
Why does my Spider-Man 2 game glitch more then a call of duty day one release.
I don’t know what it is but i liked the first marvel spiderman story more than this one. Although the combat is like ten times better in marvel spiderman 2
The game is AMAZING! Already got the platinum, love each second of my 28 hours.
make venom game PLEASE
Hope they have DLC for this game
Bro said the thing! The 19 inches of venom 🤣🤣 this guy is awesome
You’re amazing Bryan. Thanks for helping create this awesome masterpiece of a game for us.
This man is the reason I’m so happy!
1. Game is too short - 11 hour story and 20 hour platinum is bs. 2. The venom looks cool, but thats more of a version of carnage than a version of venom outside of the looks. The symbiote has no personality, its just edgy and sadistic like carnage and barely talks. Its not even clear by the end if Venom hates spiderman or just loves him and wants him to join him - I have never seen venom go around enslaving people or making people join him, but carnage super does. 3. Not a single easter egg or cameo for eddie despite him getting a reference in 1 - just lazy.  4. The symbiote looks more like tentacles than goo. 5. If you are gonna go full Donny Cates and only made an 11 hour story, maybe put some knull stuff in. You could have at least padded the story out more to make the game feel more worth it. 6. Needless to say I am a huge Venom fan and was super stoked on this game - i bought the collectors edition, got my 19 inches of venom, and after a a couple days i was done and felt very ripped off. They didnt make a complete game, they crapped on my favorite marvel character of all time (once again), and they made a lesser product than spiderman 1. 7. Miles still sounds 12 and looks 20
Story is not better than Spiderman 1, you didn't nail that part, characters like Black Cat and Mj were butchered for pandering to the sjw and woke agenda, they were pefect in the first game. Also y'all droped the ball with Venom's screentime, all this 19 inch jokes, best venom, yet he has 35min of screentime...dude. Gameplay and some characters like Kraven, Harry, Lizard and Venom 10/10. Story and the rest 4/10
Funny how he says sometimes we need to escape the real world stuff yet they filled the game with woke politics. 😂😂😂😂😂
why is the game so short for 70 bucks and why havent you updated the mechanics since 2014s Amazing spiderman 2 game
Hugs
Yo
It's a really awesome cover design and amazing that instead of just buying a new PS5 you could buy the covers and put them on your PS5 if you already owned one. Too bad they only sent about 10 of them to each retailor so they sold out very quickly and gave something else for scalpers to ruin, good job on that.
I just feel this game wont be in exsistance if not fr Batman Arkham series.....
It’s weird this whole time it’s not scale New York?? Ik something was off but wow it feels like I’ve been lied too… I was trying to look for my old school the city college and couldn’t find it guess this explains why
The ONLY gripe I have is that it's not long enough, I wanted so much more content, already finished it twice while taking my time 😂 I love it, just want more
19 huh?
My god is he sympathic, love this guy. Hope he stays at Insomniac
11:54 What a heartwarming answer, Bryan. Kudos to you and the entire Insomniac Games team
"Why is Spider-Man 2's Venom the best Venom?" That's the neat thing: He isn't.
One of the most boring game i have ever seen. The entire story was a snoozefest
Marvel's Spider man 2 is an amazing game, one of the best  I can't wait for the Wolverine game because Insomniac are cooking. It's gonna be interesting, the story they will tell because Insomniac always had original take for the story  Please be RATED M! We need that violence for Wolverine and chaos
Absolutey killed this game  cannot wait for DLCs or a 3rd game
I bow to him and everyone at Insomniac. They made Venom truly scary in this game.
This Guy is a Genius. He literally was one of the most influential parts of making  These Games so Great. Thank You Insomniac for making this The Greatest Game Ever!!!
My biggest problem with Spider man 2 is that there are 2 spider man.
Ok that Spiderman PS5 design is awesome.
let him and his team direct a marvel movie imagine how great that would be
thank you for giving us this amazing game. please give us atleast 2 more
Let us design our own suits in the next game please!!
this is definitely GAME OF THE YEAR. hands down
I just finished the game maybe 20 minutes ago and i think i can actually say that Spider-Man 2 is the best superhero game of all time. I really didnt think they could beat the arkham games but they did and it was spectacular amazing astonishing and some other choice adjectives jj uses
Why didn't Peter just give the Anti Venom Suit to Harry?
The title of this video should be "Director answers all the generic and safe questions he chose, while dodging the big ones."
We didn’t get a Peter B. Parker suit and that’s a massive missed opportunity.
I just wanna know when ng+ is dropping
I've beaten the game twice, 100% on both, and I gotta say; the game is insanely beautiful. The team at Insomniac knows their stuff. Cant wait for New Game Plus 😁
You created a masterpiece for us Spider-Man fans 🥰🥰  P.D. Getting to know you through these questions makes me see that the whole Insomniac team and you are REALLY amazing :O ❤️
Still want the leap of Faith suit
I can’t use normal venom after completion why is this?
Creme de La Creme 10/10 🕷 🕸
To anyone new who watches this video. DON'T DO IT! THESE PEOPLE HAVE NO RESPECT FOR OTHERS WHO DON'T WANT SPOILERS!! Save your self the frustration and disappointment of idiots in the comment section!!!
I was confused why its playing 2x speed. Glad my phone isn’t bugging up. Lol
I love the PS5 plates, but I gotta be honest, I didn’t even realize the plates on the console were the Spiderman ones until he showed them. Kinda wish they did more at least on that side
Bryan I know u r goin to read the comments   I would love if possible to be able to walk/fight standing in the side of buildings in the third game. Thanks
the words "Spider-Man 2's venom is the best venom" doesn't hold a candle to actual Venom, I do really enjoy this take though
Thank Bryan Intihar for this sublime creation of art the studio created! I hope the third game is expanded and make is even more detailed and exhilarating to play as Spiderman or men.
give us new game+, make missions replayable, and let us change time of day
I'm wondering how the next game is gonna be even bigger. How will the expand the map and abilities?
honestly this made me way more excited for the future than i already was, spiderman 2 was phenomenal and now i’m even more impatient for wolverine and (i assume) miles morales 2
This man needs to direct a movie or show… he’s that big director chops
Okay
Thank you for making venom a playable character.
Your incel accent brings legitimacy to this game
Absolutely beautiful man
This man is a treasure and needs to be head of creative for all Marvel Games IMO. Thank you for giving us these masterpieces of a game.
So we hopefully getting a venom free roam with unique abilities getting able to kill civies fight spider man police in the next dlc? Lol
Bryan said that no production team is perfect. While that may be true for the standard creativity, insomniac has proven that it is indeed a fluid and perfect gaming franchise that they can make.
The Agent Venom suit was so cool! I hope they bring in Flash Thompson as Agent Venom in later games.
Greatest game I’ve ever played. I thought it was a dream when it was all said and done.
This guy is my hero, thank you for the love and passion you put to the characters and the story Bryan, you guys are really doing something special! ❤️
11:56 this hit so hard my god
First video game that I gave 10/10 Thank you Insomniac for everything. Looking forward for more spidy in the future🎮🎮🎮
PLEASE PLEASE brings some DLCs, PLEASE drop another spiderman game as soon as possible, I want more content! . I cannot wait. Im almost got 100%, I'm currently at 97% with the last couple spiderbots left to collect. One of the best game on PlayStation beside the last of us, GOW, and Infamous.
The Web Wings were kinda in the first Spider-Man with the 2099 suit power. Basically a beta version. Hope that means we can get a 2099 DLC or game?
Thank you for this incredible gem
🗣️GOTY
I love this guy he’s a GENIUS
Bro this guy seems like a g
No wonder I couldn’t buy the special edition spider man ps5 controller because 20% of the stock is on the table
Spoilers ahead….         Can we please get an option to use regular venom powers post game
NGL I thought that the way Norman reacted to Spider-Man and Miles saving Harry was so dumb. You’re the one who literally put him in a pod with an alien and you think it’s going to be magically fixed without any damage to Harry? So dumb
1:49  "You get 19 inches of Venom... *All* 19..."
Venom spin off please!
19” of venom 😂
Imagine if when you power on that ps5 and it says "We Are Venom".
I always wonder how They Made The Venom Roar? 🤔🤔🤔
While it isn't actually Venom (technicality since that's only Brock + The Other, anyone else just wearing the Venom symbiote but isn't Venom) I do love the design used in this. Story is a bit iffy for him, but by no means entirely awful.
****SPOILERS****     Can we get an update to change the symbiote suit color back to black after beating the game?
I would love a 2099 spider-man game, or a spider-gwen, any of the alternative spidermen would be insane
11:55 his answer made me say “This guy gets Spider-man”
The only qualm I have is that the first two Spider-Man games 2018 and miles side content was just filler so I assumed this game side contact would be the same boy what a mistake I wish I didn’t go on YouTube and just played all the side content and I wish there was some kind of prompt or notification letting you know that this game is different
The Best Game Director of all times !!
That was awesome 👏🏿
GO SPORTO!🎉🎉🎉
May i know why swinging after 15 mins gets bored in previous games,.
We need that black spidey suit with matching goo attack color in the endgame, I made sure to have save games when u get it, but still gotta fix that for endgame.
I would have love if someone question him why they change peter parker face and the real reason behind it

Bryan is truly for the people. Nothing but respect ✊🏽
MORE SWING ANIMATIONS!!!!!!
SM2 is awesome game overall, but Venom was awful. No arachnid powers, another stupid piece of substance that does nothing but throws tendrils. Similar to Ultimate Venom, which is the most boring Venom ever.   Black suit also doesn't make much of a difference. Same zone-attacks with different animations. Venom is the most boring thing in the game about Venom. Remove this variable and make Harry A Goblin JR – would be times better and more chemistry.   Venom must have been a classic Brock with arachnid powers which makes him an Ultimate Spidey's enemy that does everything spider can but better. I'd make this game a Venom's hunt for Parker. Insomniac writers got awesome feel of Peter, Miles Morales, Fisk and Mr. Negative as characters and archetypes. But they've zero sense of what made Venom actually great IMO.
Hope we can get a non-canon update that lets us run around the city as venom
I also wish they didn’t throw it in our face who had the symbiote in the beginning
Venom needed to be in it longer.
Y. Q
Miles story line in the game was so good how he was always worrying for Pete during his Vemon era and his life of becoming more and more like spider man
People turn off the auto swing help, it makes it SO much more interesting.
I hope they add the option to change the time of day, weather, etc. because I wanna swing around at night in the rain with that classic Black Suit

Superior Spider-Man is 100% going to happen in Spider-Man 3
I need them 19 inches of venom you know
That last question really hit me 😢
That last question and response was so deep, I am glad to have someone like him directing Spider-Man 2.
Everything now that juicy 19 inches is the best
IMO they dropped the ball with this game
Are we ever going to get a Daredevil game that's what I want to know
First port the game to pc, then we'll start talking
Insomniac is the best iteration of the spider man and the spider man universe we got outside of the comics
hope they read this lol but give peter variant options and why can’t we be venom anymore😢. WE ARE VENOM
Why did you nerf pete?
Great game overall. Although the ending script was a little weak. I was expecting more of the peter-venom duel at the end.
So this is the guy responsible for the Mary Jane levels?
I'd like to ask him why he didn't include a transformation ability for Peter's symbiote.
No having to pay micro transactions for different suits 🔥🔥🔥🔥 insomniac lit
I agree with everything you said, hope you can help create even more breathtaking and amazing experiences!!!!
It's the best Venom, but it's the best Harry Venom.
Why did they lie about Who was going to be venom as if it wasn’t obvious
I wonder what they are going to do with cindy? Will we have a 3rd playable character in the DLC if we have one?????
There will never be another Venom better than this one. How do you top that.
Goat ending, thank you for this masrterpiece Bryan.
Awesome game
The entire staff needs a paid vacation! Great job to everyone!
we need Intihar to take over the Days Gone franchise, just imagine...
I just started playing Spider man 2 and OMG the sheer scale and quality of the game is rarely seen nowadays I'm literally blown away just by the look of the city.
This video should’ve been released a week ago I’m already half done with the game
By far my favorite Wired video, he killed it
If only they asked him about the Cuban flag Puerto Rican flag mixup
No one asked about NG+???
The two suits I was really hoping for was the Ultimate Black Suit (because I really like the symbol) and the Earth 42 Prowler Costume (it looks so cool). Perhaps in a DLC or a Spider-Man 3
Question: why did you go with the overplayed “Norman blames Spiderman” angle eventhough Spiderman shows zero fault in any of this?  Feels very sloppy and I feel that it could’ve gone a way more interesting route using creative liberties.
Your team has set the bar REALLLY high, the game is incredible. Thank You 🙏🏻
I wanted to thank Insomniac in person for this one, I wanted them to know how loved this game already is.  I don’t know how people still say it’s repetitive or more of the same, that really get into my nerves.  This is not just game of the year, it’s game of the generation. Thank you for making this game real, my inner child has never been so happy and alive. And my adult self too
We need a co-op on and offline dlc
the symbiote gameplay was god tier satisfying
i wish they added the spiderman unlimited suit
This guy looks like he absorbed Jeff Kaplan to steal his powers.
How, like HOW, this video only has 60K views? This is amazing, he sure is amazing. I can tell he loves Spiderman and the game he and his team made.
Y’all better be workin on that new venom game ASAP‼️
Second question and second response is perfect. Motivating for me because I’m not sure what I want to completely do yet. Whether it be making a film, or producing a game, or starting a business.
Genius what a masterpiece
Absolutely phenomenal game. There were exactly 0 villains that appeared in random crimes, but I wasnt expecting that anyway. It would be pretty cool tho if that was a regular feature going forward.
I thought this was one of the sklar brothers
goat
the goat
This game brought me back to when i was a little kid amazed at spiderman (N64). My new favorite game.
So is that one building, you guys already know which one, supposed to be the Baxter building????
The thumbnail is so misleading and false lol
I swear I thought that was Jeff Kaplan for a second
At 11:54, we all need to take a break or reset every once in a while.
Can we get Toby and Andrew’s homemade suits
Will the game come to PC??
Imagine this. They give us a black suit and red and blue suit aswell as a miles suit that are completely customizable. You can change the eyes, emblems, everything, basically. Making the suits your own.
12:00 funny cus still there real life reminders inside this game also
Such a great game
Fun fact: Intihar means "suicide" in Turkish and Arabic
19 inches 😫😫
But the new Peter's Face tho 😔😬
Game is amazing! I’ve platinum it in 3 days. Im sad its already over! Insomniac killed it with this one. Need a dlc or expansion asap please
I really hope they continue adding more traversal elements throughout these new games
19 inches of venom 😭
Horrible movie are you serious
Great game, but i really wanted them to focus on other heros being in the game
I have more important questions. Like how did a studio like Insomniac miss that the flag in Miles apartment is the Cuban Flag when he is Puerto Rican? Your a company with millions of dollars and hundreds of employees. But, hey at least you got every single one of those LGBTQ flags right. Guess some people are just more important. Or how about the fact that you guys backed off on portraying police officers in a postive manner? Probably because of all the BLM stuff which is understandable since one of your main characters is black. Man, miles must really not like his father then because he was a police officer that heroically died in the line of duty.
That mission when you encounter more of kravens hunts, gives me nostalgia for some reason, the vibe of the mission is dope, the missions are fun af, I imagined spidey classic games like spiderman 2018, and spm2 ps5 when I was younger it was back when I played web of shadows 🔥🔥🔥
I hope they do one of these with an indie dev, there are very different answers to very different questions when there's more limitations  the games a very different too and usually have to be more nuanced in the gameplay
goated director everything abt this game is beautiful asff
It's a first party game sure, but I can't get over how well the game is optimized for PS5. The instant fast travel is so good.
Bryan THE FREAKING GOAT Intihar
The loop de loop is so fun
why didn't they leave us the ability of the Symbiote at the end of the game like during the free mode because it's stupid of them because they made us like ah well you can only use the ability of the Symbiote during the story mode but we remove the Symbiote's ability during free mode after story mode but you can only use the costume during free mode after finishing story mode.
I’m not joking, at Insomniac whoever came up with 19 inches of Venom needs a raise.
It’s so interesting to learn this stuff
I just want DLC already. Insomniac is just a team of absolute superstars. Bryan is a legend.
I want 19 inches of Venom so badddddddd
Bryan Intihar is the goat him and his team at insomniac really take the time to listen to the fans and see what kind of things they want in the game. Not a lot of game developers do that.
The game is really good! Please release an update bringing new game plus into the game and also the ability to change night and day after finishing the game.. Also please make missions and events replayable
Thank you guys for making the best SM game ever
Please allow us to toggle night/day and weather settings as well as the color of the symbiote powers post-game!
Okay so add Bronx and make the crime rate much higher with more turf wars😂 that making it more realistic considering that Bronx is the most dangerous bourugh in New York.
Why is Spiderman 2 a buggy mess
Lemme get a p5 bruh😔
i wonder  if we will see eddie brock in the future 🤔
He’s so cool bro
What’s crazy is I beat the game and in a couple of sections of the map there are icons locked and to unlock a few more suits I need to progress further into the game so I ain’t gon stop play til I reach 100% completion
Where's the Sensational suit, Bryan? WHERE?!
Ok
i hope we get a venom spin-off
the story of this game was such a let down, the 3rd act completely ruins everything that came before with a terrible villain who has no character or personality and fan service that means nothing
This guy is an absolute legend! Hope we get an expansion for Spider-Man 2!
Xbox is probably watching and taking notes so that they can try doing even 2% of what this guy and Insomniac do lol
Insomniac never fails to surprise us
This game has to win the game of the year!
I have been enjoying the mission playthroughs by @theradbrad and the creativity and storytelling in the game is awesome! I love how Peter's and Miles's stories are both just as important as their masked alter egos. The side missions are just as cool and interesting as the main plot missions. It really is a joy, so thank you to the entire creative team for the game!
I can't believe the Fragile Eagle makes my favorite game. But then again I am wearing my money hat!
first question is such a banger I always love knowing stuff like that
Wtf is there a time limit for this games exclusivity or is it PS5-only indefinitely?
ADD THE BLACK SYMBIOTE ABILITIES FOR AFTER YOU BEAT THE GAME THANKS !!
The only thing that's bad about this game is that I already platniumed it and I want more hahaah my all time favorite game now
The legend Bryan Inithar you know 🔥🔥
Insomniac really is the best.  Just hearing this guy talk got me feeling we got the best 3rd game incoming
This man is the GOAT
Most anticipated game in a long time, hoped to get a PS5 by now but my country has almost 200% inflation yearly and us dollar is skyrocketing so today a console and a game costs up to 9 times the minimum month salary so imagine there are bigger fish to fry haha.
I cried seeing the first interaction with Pete and Harry. I have been waiting for a proper friendship moment between those 2 for a long time. At the end, I didn't even want to fight Harry. Also the moment where peter just sits with grandpa Earl on the side missions really brings out who spider man is, and who peter is. Just that breif moment was so beautiful, because spiderman is not a symbol of vengeance, but he is a symbol of  hope and friendship.
1:46 fire
Yeah explain how you mixed up the cuban flag with Puerto rican.
This game is the best Spider-man,  super-hero game and the best Spider-man movie at the same time.
I like that ending, sometimes it is hard, so yeah I would love to play a game and just escape
Did he answer if they could add black tendrills post game
He said it???!!!
They need to make an option to change the color of the tendrils according to the symbiote suit you have on ASAP. Huge immersion breaker for late game gameplay
Please MAKE A DAREDEVIL GAME!!!!
I wish we could’ve fought venom with Any suit. Wanted that classic feeling fighting him in red
A chic wanted me to drive to her place on launch weekend. I told her I couldn’t cause I was gonna get 19 inches of Venom. A man has his priorities 😂
Why can't u change FOV? Its feels so weird when playing the game with pc, feels to close.
Is this a repost or just late? Seems like it was recorded months ago
I have a question. Why do you feel the need to include leftist nonsense in your game about a gooey alien and an 80’s action cosplayer?
Spider man 2 was great, but i liked the first game more. idk why but the vibe was just better.
When I look at these people I understand why Covid happened.
I wish this game was longer. I platinumed it within 2 days.
CARNAGE!
Was hoping he'd answer why they changed faces for peter and mj or why they kept the mj stealth missions but of course they didnt answer those questions
Thanks for the valuable insights brian intihar... It will really help many aspiring Game developers like me... Lots of love... Keep on rocking ❤🔥✌🏻
I need the big time stealth suit back 😭
Finished the game.. loved the game as a whole.. if im being honest.. somethings felt rushed and did not need to be there but thats just nitpick on my part.. one of the best games ive ever played
I have a question why do you guy inject modern day politics in game ruining my escapism?
best game of the year
I WANT SPIDER-MAN 3 NOW .....I CAN'T WAIT 5 YEARS
why did you gotta add woke lgbt crap in your game
This story was way less emotional and moving way too fast than the first one, we barely got any scenes with symbiote spiderman and the whole venom arc is also extremely short.
Man it sucked that it was so glitched
Any news on dlc?
Oh yeah Brian gimme all that 19 inches of Venom.
Woah
The textures are too shiney, all around, but especially the Venom textures.  I imagine the symbiotes to have a matte skin or sandstone appearance but fluid.  I would also like to see the suit traverse the character models more fluidly instead of the tendril transition.  Something akin to liquid detergent spilling into itself.  I'm a big fan of the classic look and I love the Spider-Man TAS Venom/Carnage designs, especially the eyes.  The contemporary take on the symbiotes is extreme.  I feel like I'm overdosing on tendrils...  The game models don't have to be wildly intricate and abnormal to be visually stunning and memorable.  PS, the first black suit is trash, please fix  😅
'' Get all his 19 inches of venom''
How are we going to know this when we don’t have a Ps5
Peter's Level 58 suit is my absolute favourite, thank you Intihar! ❤
We need venom game
*Because it has 19 inches.*
I love his response to the last question. Video games helped me through a really rough time in my life. Thank god for great games to help us escape.
I hope Spiderman 3 gets the Puerto Rican flag correct. 🇵🇷 Also more cop involvement! 8/10
i swore i wouldnt try to beat this game too fast so i could enjoy it. i couldnt stop playing and im already about to start a new game on Ultimate difficulty…..
Thank you bryan. All 3 games were great
Praise this man he is a genius 🙌🏾
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT TYPE OF VIDEO I WAS WAITING FOR
Yooo❤
Both Kraven and Venom disappointed me
I wish there was a arcade mode for spider man 2
I'm sorry but "web wings" should be in every spiderman game. It was part of his original design.
The 19 inches of Venom was my favorite part !!
he did it again
what abt new game+
Bryan I really like the game but plz  fix the bugs and let me replay bases and change the time of day and put in new game + and mission replay and add bios back and have an option to make the anti venom abilities back to black plzzzzz
This man and his team delivered us a MASTERPIECE
Bro thanks for this amazing guy is the reason we have amazing games for spider man and more 19 inches venom
I think this is a masterpiece, a beautiful game the really feels the next gen state maybe the best Spider-Man yet ,but not for me or maybe until yesterday when I found the mother of all bugs in game, I don’t want spoil nothing of the main story , but I’m laterally stuck in a mission and cannot advance in the story. Painful
The game sounds like it’s the best of this year, May hope brings the potential of the third sequel 🤞🏾🤞🏾.
Such a brilliant man right here. Spider-Man 2 is quite frankly the best Spider-Man game of all time. Thank you for dedicating many many years to your craft and everyone else that has blessed these games.
The symbiote abilities are so satisfying to use.
I CANT WAIT FOR WOLVERINE‼️
No, ultimate venom is the best imo
amazing game
I wish spiderman said “where are the avengers when you need them” as he looks at NYC venomized
I used to listen to Bryan way back on the 1up podcasts and now he's making these incredible games.  You've come a long way, Bryan!!
He works really hard 🤝🏿 salute well deserved congrats on the Game
My heart can’t handle another Harry and Peter bromance decay 😭 why can’t we just chill and not kill each other . It’s always Norman bro
I got a guestion why can I only use the anti venom abilities colors after beating the story 🫠
Will there be a DLC or two like the PS4 Spider-Man game did?
I only came here for the 19 inches of venom
If you are watching this bryan, please consider a M rated venom game as the main character. I know the other team is busy with wolverine, so fingers crossed
The game is great I also platinum the game as well. The only downside playing the game is the glitches and the bugs. being inside the truck or enemies being inside of the sand in the beginning of the game. The interaction button doesn't pop up at times. In the end of the game, I went so fast to the point i was stuck to the venom web. There are many glitches but not as bad as Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. The game is still a highly recommended game. However, Why was the game in gold if there was so many bugs in the first place? I have 40 hours in the game already!
This is GOTY Period..🔥🔥🔥
He could have easily voiced Peter Parker
First of all THANK YOU FOR THIS GREAT GAME I LOVE IT!!  Second of all Coop Update when?
19 inches of venom... sounds like a video I've seen before...
I want that big black PS5! without the spidey! I hope the PS5 Pro is BIG and BEEFY!!!!
IS Best charVenom I See
But can he answer why Insomniac laid off all those people?
Spiderman officially has better movies, better games, and comics than batman. I rest my case
Why do they always have hair like that. Either messy, balding or both 😂
Imagine the next game’s villains are the Sinister 6 and Spider-Man 2099
Thanks for featuring my question @ 11:13! Definitely appreciate all the graphics modes and that they all had ray tracing. Amazing game and I even did a review on my channel for it 🔥🫡
BEST CREATIVE DIRECTOR!!! now knowing that he was there for the gaming community years ago, makes him so important to insomniac, he knows what the fans want
I know it'll come down to a licensing issue. The fact that the avengers tower exists but not the avengers makes it really ominous
"As great as Life can be" lol never heard that take before.
19 inches of venom 🤤🤤🤤
Web of Shadows did it better...
I hope in the DLC we get more across the spider verse suits aka the Spider-Man 2099 suit with its added physique like miles across the spider verse suit made him taller lol. Also I know we keep the anti venom power but why can’t we have the black symbiote power when using the symbiote suit?
'all 19 inches of venom' i love how they're in on the joke too
Can’t wait for wolverine
Is it worth it upgrade my PS4 to PS5 just for this game?😅🥲
This is a guy is a true legend
I love this guy. You can tell he’s so passionate his job and the character and world of Spider-Man. These games are my favorite Spider-Man media out there and just might be the best representation of the character. Thanks Brian!
Spider-Man 2 is some of the best content I have ever witnessed in my life. As a die-hard Spider-Man fan, this game checked all the boxes for what makes a great Spider-Man game and story. Insomniac NAILED the Symbiote Spider-Man portrayal and made Kraven and Venom some of the greatest versions of Spider-Man villains in any medium. There were plenty of surprises, and I can't wait to see what comes next for the Spider-Man franchise!
I just platinumed the game and have platinumed the first two games too. Really such a fun series and can't wait for more.
Spider-man 2 was Amazing! I'm really hoping that Wolverine is going to be m rated it needs to be gory as possible to feel like you Are truly the Wolverine
Having another Howard side mission was a good addition, too. Especially with the small nuances of Miles' reaction vs. Peter's history with him in the dialogue was also really cool.
Loved the passion that he shows!  Like if u agree!     👇
One thing I didnt like ( or rather dont make sense ) is why the symbiote suit is treated like any other skin, rather than a powerup.  And the fact that Symbiote Spiderman isnt hostile to pedestrians, felt like a missed opportunity to me. Its treated as any other costume, when its more than that.
The haters hating on the game they didnt play, ofc, keep crying
Greatest Spider-Man game of all time
Wish we could actually enter peters house at any point. Or if they developed a Peter parker free roam ability, like u just run into an alley and change. Would make the gameplay way more interesting
Fix the bugs
ADD BATTLE ARENAS TO THE GAME! Would be cool to not only play as miles or Peter but villains also or have a rampage mode where you play as venom and destroy everyone, arenas could be similar to the arena we saw when miles fought Martin Li. Add boss battles to these arenas and make them harder to defeat whilst also adding new attack moves so they become harder to predict.
The game is fantastic. Must buy for any Marvel fan.
19 inches of Venon, thats a bit much mate.
What we need in Spiderman 3  Suit damage ( including mask) Combat mode and stealth challenges Learnable combos like in Spiderman 2 2004
You guys did an amazing job on the game loved every second symbiote spider man is one my favourite stories. Since I already had a ps5 I only got the controller but it’s awesome with the game but it’s awesome 😁
Is this guy massive or is that PS5 small, because I'm sure a PS5 is a lot bigger than that? 😮
Game was great, except for the ridiculous costume they give Miles at the end. Please immediately undo next game, thanks.
Think you finish the game but you don’t have a platinum trophy 🏆 you haven’t finish the game 🤦🏻‍♂️
Thats crazy ! You dont need coding skills to be a creative director.
bryan's the best director man hands down
Can u add a toggle on spider man 2 to turn the symbiote abilities on so you can have the black ones after the story you can put it in the ui section
You guys went ham with the villains. InsomniGOAT! Last game needed more villains. You lot delivered!
They really push the game to it's limits, Game of the Year For Sure, Respect To Bryan Intihar for answering questions at Wired!
Was an amazing game, need a the 3rd (or 4th if you think about it)
Guys…not saying this is an Easter egg or teaser but his hair looks like WOLVERINE
It's my dream to become a creative director at a game studio but I've always been demotivated when I attempt code writing, art drawing and modelling. Hearing Brian's journey is super inspiring. Well done man
They should adapt the dead of Gwen Stacy in Spider-man 3, and by that I mean I want Norman killing MJ
huge respects
They failed the story
They failed the story
I just got the platinum. Someone give this guy a round of applause because the game is unbelievably good
My spoiler tangents incoming     1)I wish we could explore Aunt Mays house during open world 2) change the weather after finishing the game  3) have black venom abilties
Wolverine game???
after beating the game can we get the option to change peters venom back to black for cosmetic?
They gotta be making a venom game...
Got everything right except his #1 trait that venom is the only one that had the ability to psychology torment spiderman you guys watered him down to big dumb monster character im sorry insomniac but you failed venom
things I would like to see in Spider-Man 3:  1. I liked how you added visible rooms and npcs inside scyscraper windows it would be cool if you could randomly initiate different animations where they get freaked out by Spider-Man crawling on the window or get excited and take a selfie with him lol.  2. While we swinging it would be cool if you made a lot more of the bridges and different openings where you can zip line through the small opening. Going across the big bridges there are so many places it would have been cool to web zip through.  3. You really should have more varying swing and take down and combat animations. Animations repeat too much.  4. When trying to web swing climb up a skyscraper it would be nice if there was an ability where if you let the swing hold until the momentum starts to go vertical Spider-Man can like wind up and have a jump boost slingshot vertically up, sort of like he does in the movies. 5. Run on the wall and on the ground while still holding the web line
BRO SAID 19 INCHES OF VENOM 😭😭
the glazing for insomniac in these comments is absolutely ridiculous 😭
When are we getting new game plus????😭😭😭
Legend
👏👏👏you guys/ladies did a great job on the game!!! Congratulations!!!
I just knew when someone talked about Venom's design, that 19 inches was gonna be referenced.
ı need 3
spider man 2 is a masterpiece
Even though I’m not up to the venom part yet,I’m exited to get that part when I do,I’m having a lot of fun! Great game!
Please Insomniac, add these very important features : (SOILERS AHEAD)   - New game+ and replayable missions  - A time of the day and meteo conditions selector (why no proper dynamic cycle? 😢)  - The possibility to play with both the black suit and « angry » Peter after the story is completed  - Add a Peter Parker and a Miles Morales “suit”  -Add Black Cat as a random encounter while fighting crimes  - Add more random crimes variety   👍
loved the game... fix all the bugs though
You did a great job, the entire staff needs a raise 🙌🙌🙌
5:11 OMG IM IN THE VIDEO!!!!! THANK U BRIAN FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTION!!
They nerfed Peter too much in this game
SPIDERMAN 2 PS5 IS GOTY CHANGE MY MIND
He should not be bragging about the “deluxe” suits lmao
Please Change Miles final suit other and let us Change the Color of the symbiote other than that I am very thankfull. Insomniac made me feel like I am 6 years old again
They really doubling down on the “19 inches of Venom” thing 😭😭
I got platinum in 2 days 💀
INSOMNIAC you didn't test and check your* Videogame like you were supposed to stop cap'n.
BRING BACK THE OLD PETER FACE!!!
19-inches of Venom. He said the thing. That’s a true fan of character right there.
I love how the 19 inches of venom meme is just a running joke now its great
For those who have 120Hz TV’s, we will have 40FPS as well? How did that make sense? 😂
Why is the game so woke?
Yeah, i've got a question. Why does Brooklyn not look like Brooklyn?
I know it's a spider-man game but it feels weird that there's a empire state sized avengers tower shadowing all of new york and they never once mention anything about them. Like, in this universe are the Avengers just super successful day traders or accountants or something?
The character design, especially the bigger lizard and venom, the story setup and the sheer attachment it creates with the characters, a beauty of a game.
His hairline is how i look at MJ's face design.
11:10 "if you like villain you will be rewarded" *proceeds to let Kraven kill all villains*
19 inches of Venom.
Spider-Man 2 - 10/10 Masterpiece literally the Best Super-Hero Game ever made🔥🔥🔥💯🏆
Romans 12 verse 21 Do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good   Psalm 147 verse 3 He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.
The final unlock for Peter being the black and gold suit was super disappointing imo lmao
I have a better question: why do you claim to embrace and respect other cultures...but then you attempt to modify Spanish in your games, to include grammatical nonsense like LatinX? Doesn't the idea of re-engineering someone else's language to suit your ideological tastes...strike you as a tiny bit arrogant and obnoxious? Perhaps even, dare I say it, cOLoNiALiSt?
Release the new PlayStation
Venom should’ve been in the game longer. Although the story was really good I feel like we didn’t get enough missions
Insomniac should have full control over marvel properties for games
Obviously this is a man who loves his job so much.
My only request for this game would be way to change the time of day post-campaign
Ayy, what a nice man that has made a wonderful game. I liked what he said at the end. W Director.
19 INCHES OF VEMON
Spiderman 2's venom is NOT the best venom.
This was the best Spiderman game and best depictions of it's characters. To see actual murder and killing, plus accurate sizing of the characters is awesome! I hope to see Carnage as a main villain, with a team up with Spiderman and Venom to defeat an overpowered Carnage. Then expand to include Knull!
IF they should choose to make a Venom spin-off I hope they go with Eddie Brock, but for this story using Harry was an excellent decision. Really pulled on my heartstrings towards the end.
Why is everything woke?
I was trying to get this collector edition. NO luck. Thank you, Scalpers
question: why is black cat so hot?
Best game developer
HE KNOWS THE 19-INCHES VENOM
Bro I love Venom!! This game was fantastic! Nice plot twists btw 😂
LETS GO BRYAN INTIHAR!
they need to fix the symbiote abilities to have a black color like the black suit and not just white color for anti venom(and as a parry switch the symbiote with the tech arms)
I wish Insomniac could make a Jak & Daxter game, I still hate Naughty Dog for abandoning one of their great IPs and focusing on TLoU as well as doing a lot of cashgrabs, imo I think Insomniac could make a great Jak & Daxter game since they made so many Ratchet & Clank games in the past, and the fact that Insomniac is very experienced in directing, making music & sounds, make the game fun as possible and so on, makes me think that Insomniac deserves to have the Jak & Daxter IP. To this day I still hope for a new Jak & Daxter!
idc what anyone says this is my GOTY.
Wired,  I want an email responding job at insomniac, make it happen
I just find it hard to believe how the avengers haven't shown up yet in these massive events
All 19 inches of venom is very cool.
1:49
No freaking way it's spooderman
He knows the 19-inches joke LMFAOOOO
Hiya also where's Jacksepticeye's comment anyway?!
The story of Spider-Man 2 was so good, especially the Peter/Harry dynamic which was the heart of the game’s story
I've already finished the game, it's a great sequel, 10/10
More like this please, love the behind the scenes stuff
First pls like me ❤
Real first
