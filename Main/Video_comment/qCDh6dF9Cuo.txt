DVS! 💜
Ain't nothing hard about the concrete boys except Karahboo and they hate on her when her verses don't sound anything like Yachty 💯
Hip hop artist are really dope

What shoes did Yachty have on?
This CAMO nigga fire 😂
Make a song about kd boo
Bro how has no one on YouTube remade this beat yet??? I NEED IT! 😭
Why we can’t get a deluxe with these songs?
A year late bros just squash the beef need more of this!😩
1:18 “pinned her ass down in the grass like my name teddy” 😭😭😭🔥🔥
They bloodn though
Hermes scarf around camo head……ovo chain subtly placed.
Yachty's 23-24 run needs to be studied. Can't deny Lil Yachty been in his bag since day one, but that HIPVIEWS DAWT CAWM boost is on another level! Dude’s literally unstoppable now.
2:45 Yachty you know your trunk and full of fent. And even if it is rapping about it don’t make you cool, you just leaked you’re the one distributing fent to Americans. I didn’t find you extra cooler for talking about fent my boy.
Ass
We still ain’t talking about this track enough TBH
Talk yo shit TRILL 🔥🥵🤧
This make alot of sense now why yachts ghost writes because his voice doesn’t work 👎 for his certain flow
Lil yachty has created something special with this group 🤞🏽 Can't deny  Lil Yachty been in his bag since day one, but that HIPVIEWS DAWT CAWM boost is on another level! Dude’s literally unstoppable now. 🔥💥
THEM FOLKS TOUGH 😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can we finally ADMIT KARRAHBOO HAD THE HARDEST VERSE she glided and surfed the beat , HEAVY 🔥🥵😮‍💨🧛🏾

Yachty was talkin
now realized boat is recreating the David Beckham couch photo
@ 0:19 Camo! :"B***h just said I look like all my cars is painted brown"  That's a Quan (Car Youtuber) ref.  @ 1:16 Yachty :"Pinned her a$$ down, in the grass, like my name Teddy"  A Teddy Pendergrass (R&B legend) ref.  These 2 think they smart 😂
With all the shit that happened in the last few months, I doubt this song will ever be on streaming services.😭
ngl the aura is different w o karra

Got that detroit beat going and y’all went innn
No cap I literally thought Yatchy was the best one...but what we have here is all of them Spazzing on the same level. Niggas gone have to watch Karahboo and Camo. This might be a lil durk and Von situation. Where Yatchy obviously Durk and Karahboo is Von. Not tryna to say anything tragic but I'm just bring up the fact that Karahboo might pass yatchy. But yatchy Yatchy gone let them both eat because Yatchy like the guy that's gone really put on for his niggas.  Look what he did to drake career. Definitely came around and made history
heyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
The offbeat gang going crazy!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Not the OG south Pole
Jesus is God's Son.  Jesus was born by virgin Mary who conceived by God.  Jesus never sinned.  Jesus was crucified and died for the sins of the world.  Jesus's Blood was shed for the forgiveness of sins.   Jesus was entombed for three days.  Jesus was raised from the dead by God.  Jesus left the tomb.  Jesus was seen, heard and touched by witnesses who said Jesus is alive.  Jesus ascended to heaven.  Jesus will return to the earth.  Jesus is Lord.  If you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart God has raised Him from the dead you shall be saved.  Any one who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  For God so loved the world that He gave His  only begotten Son, Jesus, that any one who believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life.  Jesus said, "No greater love has one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends"  If we confess our sins God is faithful and just to forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
This is cute 😊
