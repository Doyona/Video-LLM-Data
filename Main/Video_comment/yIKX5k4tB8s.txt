THAT HGH SURE HELPING HIM GET BIG HUH 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Seems like a complete asshole, but  this is a side of connor which is great to see
Such a nice guy! I would love to see Conor Vs Aldo 2
Sir your  brave love u from  India
"My ancestor own this land" - in Brasil.
you can tell by his swollen face about how much coke he does
What a kind person
This paparazzi is very likely brazilian.
Connor is a genuinely good guy
Conor is a genius, villain for the UFC but regular (nice) guy in real life
A true champion, a living legend, loved and able to walk the streets without any fear, that’s a people’s man, mad respect ✊🏻
Awesome Connor …
McGregor bro will always be the game changer not one bit boring either all the fighters have der own character now because of the notorious will always be a huge fukin fan of McGregor..
Mais le mayo l'OM Paris c'est de la merde
He stuttered when he said Brazil because he called them all rats and made fun of the entire country 😂
He's a good man till there"s too many people around
Love him..yes hate him..we  Need him Conor McGregor you got greatness in you again..don't leave us hanging ⚡🇨🇦
I love the way the camera man asking questions is so nice for a change and Conor comes up to him clicking his crutches with a smile on his face 😂
its not naturalness and hypocrisy - it betrays fear))). how he cleverly turned his attention from the question of Jake Pole to Schwarzenegger's author))))
This looks like gta 6 footage lol
This man is really nice in real life. He's just playing his role from being notorious and for money.
Conor is very humble
👍👍👍

You need more running when you get better bro hope you get better soon and get back to the game 💪
Conor this is your gameover
"I'm gonna get biig"    🔥
McGregor gets a bad rep for talking so much shit but it's all an act.. Similar to the bad guy wrestler act.. At the end of the day though he's a really nice person.. Admittedly he's gone a little too far occasionally, but people need to keep in mind in order to stay relevant people need to both love and hate him.. Hopefully he'll have another shot at some big fights, i think he deserves them..
his left leg is totally slimed
HABIB NURMAGAMEDOV CHAMPION

People should realize that this dude changed the MMA world. Props Connor! Stay strong

Parking in no parking zone wtf
Conor IS for the PSG ?
Правилна ненада останавитса ходиджи фсё будит харошо.
I don't know why celebrities don't act this kind to paparazzi more often.  It's almost like they treat paparazzi like they're not humans who are just doing a job.  When you treat people this well, they're not going to hound you afterwards anyway so it really takes no extra effort to be kind.
Khabib Nurmagemadov👍👍👍👍👍👍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
The king is back
who is a fan of Conor 👍
who is a fan of habib 👍
FFOOOKYUUUU
Конор тут порядочный такой, вел бы ты так себя перед боем

'This is not a therapy session'
🙌🤝👍
Conor do your hair as before, your strength was in your hair 'how you tore everyone before remember
Conor is a good person deep down and always has been.  He just puts an Act on to sell the fight (although I even admit he has crossed the line a couple of times with his antics ) he even said it “why would I hate a fighter when he wants the same thing I want” this was a great interview 🧔‍♂️ 👊 🇮🇪
بسلامتك كونور
Vs genjhe
Vamos conooor
mampos kau patah kaki kau kan
Their aggressive style in ufc is just like staged act but in reality they are norman human nice and social
arrogance called "conor", dont forget when Khabib smashed you  "boy" 🤧🤧🤧
Hes a big boy yet hes still worth alot of money 💰 big 💰
Узбекча гапир
👎👎👎👎👎
Another  piece of shit no good  person
He looks ready for his fight w/MGK in 2 weeks.  Two people who need to find new careers 🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣malu sampek mati
Champions don’t do that they win
Playing the victim game
he just tried to win sponsorship from the arabs..he needs money🤣..look at that shirt..good try conor..you know how to grab money even your career just done in UFC😁..
Move up welterweight.
Every body has a different journey
The last MMA SuperStar, what a personality this dude is one of the greatest.
Конир омат сог бул
All you people, listen, this, is the real conor, all the rest is "showman". Agree or not, the guy came from a plumbing apprentice, to the biggest selling, highest paid, prize fighter u all watch. U watch it, coz uv gotta see what hes up to next. The mans a huge success,
Get well soon McGregor revenge against khabib and Dustin.
Realmente precisamos da benção de Deus valeu!!!!!
Hope him get well soon corner
I love the car not mc gregor

Never seen this side of conor or is it because of his injury? Or is this the new born conor?

You break a leg, everybody seems to learn humility in the process of healing. 😀😀 And yes, the man with the cam did a splendid job interviewing. What class and politeness. Respect is given to get back. That’s what happen here. Great job!
May Allah bless you mcgregor May you recover soon and be back my man 🎉🌷🎉🙏
This interviewer is much much better than Ariel Helwani

Plz get ready cash cow so that poirier milks u again. Hahahahah
CONOR IS FINISHED
Conor - "Good brother, where you from?"  Paparazi guy - "Brazil" Conor - "🤔 In another time I would've raided your favella on horseback and killed anyone that was not fit to work, but this is a new time" Paparazi guy - "thank you conor God bless you"
Just act this way all the time conor please great interview you look great good luck on the recovery and come back. God bless EVERYONE.
Conor homme réel 💪
Kabib made him humble Dustin made him crippled
Better your sleep in home conor..
There is no therapy for a defeated soul
Khabib made him be humble
Is not over get the fook out it here
Arnold parked in the red zone where the buses need to stop to pick up the common folk  Dick....
🙉🙉🙉🙉🖕😂
🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Now connor king losser 👻👻👻 fighter lol
Great fither 🔥
some where i feel conor is a good man, please don't be bad.
He’s an actor they all are actors. It sells fights to be aggressive with your opponent but sometimes it goes too far and gets real. Very smart people but they sacrifice themselves in public in a way to make money.
Wow.. he's Big. ⚡⚡🔥🔥💯💯💯💝
Good bless yoy CONOR GRAATS FROM POLAND 😁😆😅
Connor over this JP S***like rest of us .
Great guy and great reporter
Conor hypocrite.
Pure class

who cares for this clown
Great words of Conor- “ who da fock is dat guy”
His leg his half the size 😂
Nautanki h or bolbachan bi ...😂😂😂
PSG ! 🔴🔵
great interview by the paparazzi. Shout out for being respectful to Connor
of course he's happy he's hobbling all the way to the bank !!!
Mc Gregor is a 🎷
Thought this was Chedda Bob.
big boi
Конрь ты сылни баец
He would rather talk about khabib..u should kno this
Conor seems to be in good spirits
lets go champ stay strong
Huh...mach burger
Who is Jake paul.why people are talking about him....I don't care
👏💪🙏
Papa Conor .....
Conor is so polite now, somebody made him polite, I think khabib
You are the reason why I start watching the ufc
This is the real Connor. He feels he has to switch on the bad guy switch when it's fight time now because he has kids and it has truly softened him up. Nothing wrong with that. I feel if he just stayed his true self through camp and on into the fight he would perform better. Before he had his kids and wife, how you seen him at the press conference's is most likely how he was day to day and now he feels he has to still be that way in order to be competitive. Could be wrong but that's how it seems 🤷‍♂️
Champ is lukin Bigger 💥💪👍
Interviewer: "Sup champ!"  Me: "Where?? Where??"
He wearing psg jersey💜
jake’s like “we’re getting to him”
👏👏👏 congratulations mam.
Good interview, very polite 👍🏼
What sneakers is conor wearing?
Conor mc chicken k.f.c champion hahaha
Humbled
You lookk this is jake paul kw both
Good to see Connor in good spirits  and Credit to the interviewer not trying to force no stupid questions very respectful very professional. Good man.
Assalamu alaikkum McGregor How are you Bro
he wish to be messi's freind lol
omg he is really a nice guy.... very humble.... I'm totally shocked 😲
So what...
I had no freaking idea that poirior elbow could do some real damage to mr. Bully. Glad to see him like this.
Estamos contigo en la buenas y en las no tan buenas campeo
Desde Colombia eres el mejor del mundo  el mejor

Don,t Be FOOLED, By What People are Saying, Stay Focus, Stay Happy with SELF MOTIVATION
I want to fight with the men who defeated you my iron Wright side leg so strong as burkave I lost everyone in a second
Nice brother I hope always for your success
Your days are DONE CONNER .. DUSTIN OWNS YOU!!!!… Your just being HUMBLE IN YOUR INTERVIEWS cause you got HUMBLED 😭🤣😂
Nice guy . Blessings bro
Psggg
Nice
Conor is a sausage rolling round like he's still the man on his cruchs Dustin is the man we just need nate to woop him again an he can do 1 an promote his whisky
What a loser
Connor aka Tiny Tim 🇺🇸
what we can learn? stay humble. Great to hear such words like respect 4 other people
"Someone" has been changed to humble hahahaha
everyone is talking about conor being a douche in the ring, but little did they know, he provides the entertainment purposes for u guys and hyping up the fight, someone pls appreciate this man.
Obsessed
Now this is the mcgregor I like 👏👏
Aeee, Brasil porr#. Pede pra ele mandar um abraço pra mim kk sério pf, Luiz Reinaldo de Manaus
PSG💣😎
Legend!!!!
Arnold parking illegally in Red .. sucks for tow truck driver
Loser forever....
Humble mcgregor = the finest malt version

Pengen gua low kick tu kaki sama jangka nya🤣
Thankyou khabib

Simply Beautiful to see him gentle like this. God bless this channel's creator🙏
JAKY POL
Built personality like McGregor... U are absulutely notorious. Awesome
The sign in the background, lol
CONOR UPLIFTED THE UFC GAME...
And that’s what roids do
Conor is so kind
Dont back to ufc u are not strong anymore 😁
Messi 30
😂
I lifted for biceps🦾 140 kg. Can you?
Connor is starting to look like Dana White
CONNOR is COOLER than the other side of the pillow,  Dixer from Dublin IRELAND 🇮🇪
Conor ready for another knockout... That's what needed to be title of this video.
There still giving this idiot air time
He got too fat
Suck. Broken man broken mind broken legs broken soul. Loser!
Ici c’est Paris 🥳
At first I thought this is GTA V live.
Waste the time shame on him..
“Jakey paul” 🤣
Brilliant interviewer
He became so fatt man
Conor is a businessman and a strategist, all the talk is to get into the opponent’s head and sell the fight. Conor’s known to be a very respectful person outside of the octagon.
Its a disgrace for that person to wear a soccer shirt.  Words cannot explain
0:53 Gordon Ramsay: yes, yes u are
His kooL
I like the way you interview. Keeping it classy. Kudos brother.
Connor is such a swell guy
spoteed jordan logo💪💪💪💯
Can't wait to see Conor fight 🤔
Well that's a side of him the public dont get to see. Usually hes popping off at the mouth.
I hope Connor will change his attitude
Arnold S you’re a POS . Parking in a red zone
U r always my favourite get well soon n get back ua belt champ
“This is not a therapy session.”
Now he wants to be friend with Jose.....
I think that he dont know nothing about this injury.
Conor is a fake piece of  $#$t Always has been and always will be.
Hell yeah physical therapy
Both of them are very nice guys. Not just Conor
Doesn’t look as evil as Khabib makes it out to be
Welcome to PSG 😂😂
Conor ist  best man Gossip BAE thank for this video regaze from Germany berlin 🍀 🌟
Pain meds tend to put you in a happy state.. until you run out
This interviewer was Aldo, Safe
Jose Aldo came for you
Conor seems way different from his press conferences
Well that was pleasant. Conor you just do you my man. Done well for your loved ones and that’s all that matters !
Legend
So is no one going to comment about the cars being park in a no parking zone ?
This man finished coz his arrogance..
Conor fell off
He's such a big girl
Arnold's car tho
Ici c'est Paris!
He now hates balloon
Back on the sauce 😑
I'm a big boeyyyy
Look whos leg is leg is looking like a fookin chikin leg. Skinny as Fook
It's not him
PSG hehehehehe never win
En «Suppegjøk»hele mannen😏
Oh, this is a terapy session now?
Khabib power 👊🖕🐖
Khabib truly made him humble
Badass interview
PSG buying Conor McGregor too😂😂 isn't Ramos enough
Sometimes... We have to take an ass whipping.. To humble ourselves.
I like that he thanked conors security at the end too for staying back. Respect
Bell 🔔 only works out his mouth.
Arnolds car is something else
তুমি বোকাচোদা
People who fight Jake are either tubers and/or those after a big payday... Conor isnt either. Smh
You finish boy
Чертила fac you chiken)
Psggggg
he leveled up the ufc like nobody else. the run of fights from first ufc fight up to the mayweather fight is the greatest ever. legend.
Khabib :- go sleep
Am I a bad person that clicked to watch this video hoping he'd fall down the stairs?
Is he sponsored by psg now or is that shirt painted on
Always in great spirit before the fight And in excuses spirit after the fight
PSG❤️💙
Don't worry about who Conor is, worry about yourself
This is not a therapy .
HE IS A LUXURY SPARRING...
His training partner is an old man now....hes good with those
unbreakable titanium shin bone
yey psg
Yeah thats how a man should act, treating a total stranger with respect, no matter what his status is. Good lad
Everybody think khabib is a good yeah but not as good
I was expecting him wearing number 30 Messi. PSG fan though seems to be
Only Arnold can park in the Bus zone
Khabib made him what he is today 😂😂 I mean polite
Conor is such a phony.  When the cameras are ON he is a completely different person.  Saw him in vegas and he was a biligerant drunk wanting to fight everyone but he puts on an ACT the minute he sees a camera man
You gain a lot of weight
Allez Paris !!!!
Pos kit car
You can see Connor's facial expression change when he gets to talk about himself. Loves himself a bit too much.
Respectful! 👍🏻🤙🏼💪🏼
jakey po
Khabib made him humble
Brilliant 👍👍
He said its not a therapy session
It's nice when conor is like this no need for been an ashole
when conor is being respectful, you know he's losing.
👍😁
When he's in hurt he's humble but when he's in better shape he's like devil
Boa tarde FIRST vai amém bom
The real king 🤴 god bless him
he actually sounds humble
I'm a big boy, i'm a big boy...
wow look at that car... madness....
🔥
This is how Conor usually is with his fans, very pleasant and polite.  I met him for a brief moment a few years back and he was pretty much exactly like he is in this video
The dude should fuckin retire
It seems like Conor has no one to talk to. He seems lonely??
Arnold is a real piece if shit driving that car. That's the same car Hitler and the nazis drove around in. It's so obvious what he is and what he's doing.
Looks like he’s 185 then cut down again
"This is not a... therapy session"
Arnold can east Sh!t
Conor McGregor king of all king the mapogo lion MR.T 👑 never go down 🐺
Arnold gets to park in the red with no repercussions I see.
wish all this shit between fighters stop. i like trssh talk but inside ufc only . they need to stop twitter trsh talkin and respect . hope he comeback stronge
He will never fight again
I like Conor in all moods, he is the best. The Notorious 💪😈
only Big Irish Chicken
Jake be mentionin this guy all the time, and absolutely copying him in any way he can and Conor won't even finish a sentence about the fella haha. Dingbat.
Thank you sirs
Is this the same guy that punched a old man in a bar? 😐
McGregor  THE N.1 IN WORLD!!
‘Thank you sirs’
Normal not a care in the world Conor is the best version.
Get to the chooper
Security on point. Eyes in the back of their head
Good interview not pushy 👌
Why can’t all paparazzi be like this guy, very respectful
Crazy how you can see how much muscle tone lost on left leg due to unable to bear full weight yet.
A Muslim here. I would like to see Connor annihilate Poirier. I do not like Khabib showing the soft image he displays although he is of my faith. I like Connor with the nasty side he displays prior to any bout. It is more entertaining.  Arnold Schwarzenegger is a lousy loser douchebag as he has always been. He is a globalist sellout. Anti humanity.
It's nice to see him being humble with people
Awesome
my guy starting to support PSG damn
Why's Arnold's car in the fire zone?
Por favor alguien traduzca al español 😅
That body guard with a bag looks professional
He’s a punk he’s not intoxicated don’t let the Russian pull on you my friend
I can sympathize with Connor. I hurt my back in December and it’s still not better. It really sucks getting fat when you’re hurt. You could diet but you’re totally caloric intake needs are like 1500 when you’re stilling all day
very good 👍
Connor needs to be like this in his fights everyone will like him more
Connor = Messi fan?
Get well soon champ
I wish I was there..
I knew that accent
I’ll be honest. He looks like a smaller, bearded, Dana White.
Hello  Conor from Greece.
The way a Journo should be, very respectful.
Mcgregor is the face of UFC
HOW TO BE A JOURNALIST
“ god bless the Brazilians “ ❤️
Хабиб тибе бик бойн 🤣
Anyone notice Arnold’s car is parked in the red like a boss lol
Conor loves to talk… 🤫😅
it's a pity that he behaves like a piece of s**** most of the time
Conor almost lost his life and I MEAN IT!!! 😂😂😂
Respectful interview
Glad he ain't giving jake the attention he wants.
As long as you're fluffing his ego he's a nice guy...
Dang, Conor is actually recovering quickly. Obviously didn't get Alex Smith's doctors
Arnold is boss
Titanium chin bone!
Chalk legs ain't winning no more belts.....🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
you're not a big boy conor you're 5'9 lol
Yeah. Arnolds 'doctors' have a lot of access to PEDs. Im sure he'll recover abnormally fast like last time...
Lol conor jump on that PSG bandwagon ... sigh
I THINK CONOR IS UFC'S VILLAIN RIGHT NOW   IF EVERYONE HATES HIM IT MEANS HE SOLD THE FIGHT PERFECTLY FIRE.
There's something fishy with the Paul Bros boxing matches. Logan tying with Mayweather who's never been beaten or Jake beating Woodley by a split decision. GTFO
Such a humble and nice way to approach someone not pushy didnt ask more than he needed to! Was a nice interaction not something you see very often anymore.
Amazing what a little humility and humiliation will do for a guy.
I clicked on this video only seeing PSG jersy
Didn't know Mike O'Hearn was a bodyguard.
Good to hear him in good spirits
That's what happens after kabibi wiped that ass mad him humble and friendly.
This is the McGregor we like.
Dis is not a terapy session
Arnold's car looks very nazi like
Thank you sirs 🤣🤣🤣
Yo i hope this dude asking questions succeeds. Not to many reporters show class like this man. Good on you bro. Good to see mcgregor moving around.
Npc mcgregor
🤣🤣 jake fight...? Is that Arnold's Car wow what a beauty. 😂😂
Connor was a little scared when he mentioned "brasil" it might have been Jose Aldo sending hes regards, you never know
He's a disgrace to us Irish people,  beating an elderly Irish man in a Bar in Dublin,  Horrible man ,
Hope he stays humble when he gets back in the game. He was such an amazing role model for Irish kids when he first emerged; recently, not so much.
Dam Connor is looking buff asf good to see him staying in good spirit
It’s the pain meds Connor is connor
Der ist mit Sicherheit noch auf narkotika
respect to the interviewer for approaching it the right way
What a humble champ
damn look a the leg size difference gotta play catch up with the other leg when its healed haha
Yeah you're a big boy 😂😂
I love how Conor doesn't give a fook a joke paul
He's looking pretty weak with that floppy prissy little rat leg of his. His friendly-ness is all fake as shit. Just like everything about him. Every friend he has, is on his payroll.
Just imagine Arnold in that car with a cigar and black glasses...and a shotgun...😂 Classic!
😂😂😂 you are the ex king. Time is over for you.
I like the he speak he didn't give the sh*t to any thing 😂😂😂😂😂
Respect.
Wonder if he’s going to move up in weight class
He's washed. Time to go back to island and start bushwhacking old alcoholic men at the bar.
This is like a npc conversation from gta
Good to see connor in happy spirits ,  but I find the the way he had walk out the clinic , dwn steps on them crutches , .. NOT GOOD N HE IS A STRONG MAN , BUT , 2 SEE HIM PUTTIN WEIGHT ON BOTH FEET , ON GRND , SMH... I think,  these clinics are a disgrace. . And I hope connor , rests up n the injury heals , I also think that he should enjoy life now.. peace light n love n blessings to you
Arrrrr Fooook.
Conor Mcgregor is UFC
The Irish never will be defeated
he is on drugs you idiots
what a wrong person he is, everything is showed up, every single word of his mouth is a lie!
If he would just once show his true side as how he was here maybe just maybe he would actually find more appreciation for himself with people , fans and peers alike .
"This is not a therapy session"
Sober Conor is a treat
That was actually super nice...
He is  much more humble eventually!
I hope he come back and become a champion againn😄😁
Super bro
Good job well done
He looks so happy and so humble right here. This is the true conor. Damn changed my view on him totally he looks so nice here!!
Hope you back champ
Connor is a Messi fan 😂
McGregor has given more to charity than many UFC fighters make in their careers.
Ídolo total
Was really nice to hear his positive words about aldo 👏🏻👏🏻
Arnold Parking in a red zone. I'll Be Back!
Conor is Gossip Bae.
he did not hear a question about paul
That’s one ugly car
The real Conner not the actor
He's a great fighter he knows how to put on a show weather's in the octagon or the press conference and it's really great to see this side of the guy he's a champ man nobody can argue that fhi all they're doing is hating
conor mcgregor, messi, neymar, mbape 👌
Parking in a fire lane though? For shame Arnold.
you haven't won a fight since Obama was president.
0:53 "Ima big boi" 😂
“My foot was a balloon”
Dis is not a terapy session - Conor Mcgregor
He looked big
I would love for  Connor to stay on the state of mind…
You can tell Conor feels terrible about his treatment of Aldo during there fight buildup
Jake bro, if u want cry, just cry... :/
Unbreakable Titanium Shin Bone or Wot?
Boooooooooooooooooooooooo.
Good interviewer, not provoking at all. Must not be TMZ.
You could've asked him anything and you chose to bring up Jake Paul 😒
Heavyweight fat Connor is coming!  P.S. maybe Khabib vs Connor 2 will be at heavyweight
He needs to take it easy, Relax and let the damn thing heal up properly.
Happy twee tweezeen tweenteewon😷
Conor with the Paris St Germain t-shirt !
McGregors only being nice cause he’s on a skid lol.
Broke leg good fighting in the future bad
Watch the 2 security guys scanning the area in the beginning, very interesting lmao
That was a therapy session.
Bum
that's how paparazzi should behave
Conor is the most fun GOAT ever.
This is good journalism. Not too in his face, super respectful. If only all paparazzi were like this
Conor seemed to have liked this guy and didn’t want to get angry about the kale Paul questions (since that’s all he gets asked by paparazzi)
Walks up to the guy like an NPC and starts talking. Love how he didn't want to talk about Jake Paul.
I wonder why people can be so talkative
It seem's like khabib told us the truth. he humbled him, but meeen it's nice to see 🙂
Good interpersonal interview skills. 👏
People saying they wish he was always like this, he probably is in private, he just sells the fight, he goes to far sometimes for some people but he’s just a salesman that’s why he’s the biggest draw in all of sports right now
did arnold park in an illegal spot? :)
thats who he really is, conor is such a nice man for me, get well soon bro❤️💪🏻
Ya big in the head ! Calm down Mr , you have done nothing of late for you to be so full of yourself ! Simmer down !
Psg top course, fake little wannabe hardman
Thick boy
Very gracious of him to answer all of this gentleman’s questions! Much respect. 👊🏻
fan conor mcger
You can sense their have been a chance in conners mind!
Long term humbled
Nawww that was nice
fight with Hasbulla
Awesome by conor
Damn! His a better actor than sterling
Well it’s real hard to frown with an eight figure net worth
Think Connor is trying to be nice and humble because all of these videos calling him an asshole lol
He's so humble now
Bus driver pulls in and sees Conor Mcgregor and Chitty Chitty bang bang in his bay and thinks?
Conor broken leg become so small and weak. Long time to recover but it not be the same Conor.
Wook
This thumbnail really looks like gta 5 or something :)))
Jake vs Conor to see who’s the real McGregor... Jake’s been copying everyone recently, his favorites seem to be Deontay Wilder, Conor and Masvidal and Loma.
Nice to see Conor back in good mental shape.
"now tis is a terapy session"
Conor always buys shirts 2 sizes too small lol
Always got some verbal Diarrhea to spout.
Stop fight u crippleman or it gonnabe permanent
What is it with this bloke and tucking his shirt into his shorts.
The interviewer was awesome. Respectful, seeing conor didnt want to speak about jake paul so he didnt impose his question, not asking him of a fight, speaking only of his condition. That was great
"This is no Therapy Session"
Clown Gregor
"i dont really care" sees arnold's car "is that arnold's car?"
What a dousch
He knows how to play the game, and loved how he brushee off JP 😅🤣😂 rightly so
Conor just don't be an ass but be you. Im sure its all for show and its a job and you make great bank. You seem cool as shit out talking to everyday people and enjoy the fruits of your labor.  Im up and down with you like other fans and can't ever decide if I'm a fan. Just stick to what you think is whats best for your fans and don't be an ass dude. Your a very smart fighter and super tough and I think you could of gone to bigger places as a fighter but I've been drinking crown so what do I know..lol 😆  Come back with more class and better respect
JEKI PAAL
Super cute
what's with that PSG shirt Conor ?
Mentions jake paul... Oh look at that car 😂
How does this video have dislikes ?
😅😂😂😂
He is pretty strong for man who got humiliated over and over
*CONOR* baby!!!
He’s so sexy mmm mmm look at that body
Looks like khabib, and Dustin gave this guy a humbling of his life. 🤣🤣🤣
Yet he is still a moronic asshole
PSG shirt that is crap. Go Liverpool.
Arnold pulls right up and just parks in the red.
Is he still beating up old man who don't wanna take his drinks?
Cornor : see khabib you wanted me humble now what ? Khabib : send me location
His upper body is so buffed that his legs are looking skinny now.
Connor needs to stop wearing his son's clothes. A man in kids size clothes looks cringy af.
I am a big Conor fan . But , is Jake Paul not a much much bigger dude . Conor could not break him up in the boxing ring   He just wouldn't .  HE COULDNT  Octagon is a different story Conor wraps round him like a boa and puts him to kip .  Not in the ring
Is that stoned Connor or sober Connor?
TOTAL LOSER (Trump supporter). 😂
Hahaha 😂😂😂
God bless the Brazilians
Now this is a great and friendly reporter...only brazilians can be this frendly God bless them
Win lose draw  We love THIS version of Connor
He looks almost ready to lose another fight
WoW i just love the way this reporter ask those questions so politely and was being so supportive towards Conor and his road to recovery.
Psg fan
He is messi fan .....nice
Great interview
That’s a  ‘how to’ in interviewing cold celebrities. Good jo sir. And I love the snub about that youtuber 😅👍🏻🥂
Moron had a million dollar conor talking and he ahut him up
Conor coming out with injury got more views then Jake paul and Tyrone fight
I didn’t know bjj fanatics was doing paparazzi
This is the Connor I like and respect.
God bless you McGregor! Always a loyal fan forever ❤️🙏
So he’s not so dub talking now he’s 50/50 dub now,he goes back to crumlin dub when he’s shouting shite
its nice to see him actin like a normal human being
For all those who are deceived by his unexpected friendliness, just know he is a still a cripple. It pays well to be nice to people when you have a physical disadvantage. Human nature.
Connor looks like 185lbs. Here
Actions speak louder than words.  We all saw what kind of respect he has for aldo
Who's arnold  cuz he's not talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger is he?
This got mama woodley positive vibes feeling all over it
Respect to Conor McGregor for not giving that tool the time of day💪
Carnt help but love Conner,all the hype talk aside he’s nice chap deep down
That was refreshing to see
I like this Connor mcgreggor
You go Connor, break a leg.
"I really respect him". Meanwhile, there is a clip of him walking past Aldo with his bum in his face farting.
This is not a terapy session
great spirit what spirit a keyboard warrior spirit. he cannot even win on a twitter war with lame ass other ufc keyboard warriors
I hope conor sorts himself out.
Love him or hate him this guy is special for sure
If this was a different time, I would invade his favella on horseback and kill everyone that was not fit to work, but we are in a new time, so I say *God bless the brazilians!*
is hasanabi a bodyguard now
All guys saying He's "respectful" lol. He wasn't respectful before in his good days. He even mocked "jesus" by saying if I was in his time I would beat him too". God made him a humble man now. He's a fake guy. When he loses he shows fake respect. After more 2/3 fights he will fully become respectful.  If you got angry reading this you hate the "truth".
Psg... 60 g baybeh...........
Great interview mate Nice to see a respectful reporter. Good energy between both parties. Maintain positive energy Connor. Godbless 2all.
I thought Conor joined PSG there for a minute.
Lol so funny how he is on a therapy session now.
A lot of respect for Jose Aldo. He humiliated the man.
SERGIO CONOR ❤️PSG
Interviewer so polite and respectful. Great chat with Conor. Well done.
dana yada ma ma ma
He’s probably a decent dude when there isn’t a crowd. He should stay classy like this all the time.
Amma big boy
Nice interview..thats what people want ask questions get the answers  and go . anyway all Brazilians  are so nice so fair play to this guy 👍
He's such a cool dude as long as you don't read his Tweets lmao
Conor looks huge
What a chilled dude
I love how he also thanks the bodyguards at the end.
The Notorious TURD of Ireland !!!  💩💩💩
How nice was Conor now u no it’s all for the money I would probably be the same
Is he a PSG fan? Lol
He only cares cause it makes his victory over Aldo seem relevant. If Aldo keeps taking losses then it looks like conor beat him on the way out of his career. Aldo is his best win its all ego for mcstretcher. If he lost to Aldo he would still want raid his village and enslave the people
Arnold parked in a red zone bra
Is Arnold parked in the red? Haha
I would appreciate him a LOT more if he showed this type of respect to everyone (except for those that disrespect u, then do whatever lol)
Who the fook is jake?
He Is the BEST Fighter
That shirt
Full of shit just putting his acting to work
Arnold just parks in a red zone lol
I'll stop watching MMA the day Connor fights any of their Pauls. It will be shameful for the sport.
Wow,great interaction 👌🏻
They're are acting like it's not all staged
His legs look like half cooked pasta
I loved he avoided jake paul
Connor isn't the worst I'm from Dublin and we're  very proud of him back home here in Dublin Ireland and always will be 💪he'll be back 🇮🇪🦿🙏
best part of this video..."thank you sirs " 2:18
man this interviewer deserves the world, hes a such a nice man. i can imagine thats why conor actually gave him the time of day.
Conor isn't really a bad person.  He just does dumb shit but when you meet him in person (when he is sober of course) he is super chill.
He is really nice.
fake ass conor
His still showing respect to jose🥺
Like it or not he changed the UFC & 4 ever 1 of my fav fighters come back soon champ‼️
We need more respectful paparazzi like you
People hate on Conor for him shittalking for fights but damn he’s friendly. Great showman great fighter and great guy
Conor like this is way more respectable. Be humble bro you are still a goat.
Wearing a psg shirt ew
He will never win another fight against the best
Respect, Wish Conor acted like this all the time, he seems like a very nice man.
Congratulation Bro!! Top .
2 presidents since a win 😄
This is Conor just wanting to have a conversation with the guy and the guy ruins it by recording him
Reporter: what do you think about jake Paul  Conor: that’s a nice car
Conor wearing soccer jerseys in childrens size
I hope he stay good like this
People don’t realize that he has to act like a dick to sell fights. It’s how he got his fame, money, and mayweather fights.
Arnold is litterally parked at the Bus Stop, red curb n all
Conor fans have ruined ufc, it's a clown show that even dustin isn't really considering fighting for the belt but instead looking to fight nate. Conor has soiled the sport, now its all about the money and not the skills. Its like ufc now stands for: U-nlimited  F-king  C-lowns
The dude voice is too perfect
dis is not a terapy session
I would be in good spirits too, if I had enough money like him, that I could take time off work injured  and not worry about my bills, everytime I go to sleep and wake up. He made a lot of money off of that Mayweather fight. You would see stress on a middleclass man's face, coming out of physical therapy and barely getting by on a fraction of his usual working income.
Respect to Connor
Heal up Conor ! You’ll be back soon to show these guys you’re the true king round here 👑🇮🇪
Damn this guy just got a superb interview with Conor out of nowhere I bet he didn't expect that
Nobody cares about what mr tap boy says
This is the  algood kick bak McGregor we need
idunno who tf gossip bae is but the level of respect is huge so ill follow.
Man who decided to put all those steps outside a physical therapy centre haha
I wish the interviewers would be like this all the time, when he noticed Mcgregor didn't care for the Jake Paul shit, he just dropped it.
I'm a big boiii!
What a great interview
I may not like Connor that much but very professional interview
Humble aren't we now?
He's gunna come back and fckkng dominate....the type of guy that gets injured and gets bigger is the one you worry about
Love connor the champ 🇮🇪💚👊🙏
He's walking already?!?!
This is who he really is at the core I believe, or at least I want to believe. I hope he decides to correct his mistakes at some point. He might regret them when he's 80.
He's huge and just goes too show how good he is at selling fights
Conor Mcgregor is literally a master of the 'Law of Attraction'. Just casually starts lifting weights & out of nowhere attracts Arnold, The Goat of bodybuilding, into his life.
Wow the right side of Connor! When he’s like this I forget about him being a pirrrrrrrrick.
That car is so little for Arnold
Ya'll seem to forget that Conor is a nice person actually, the only reason why he acts like a dickhead during the press conferences is to sell the fights. And that's one thing he's damn good at
Let Jake Paul fight Canelo and Conor fight with Alcohol and drugs ... Time to retire and enjoy life with 2 legs
Whatever the world say gotta respect this man for what he did in his prime..Hatsoff champ😎🤑😎🤑
When the man in a good mood, interview takes care of itself!! Nice one
If only all paparazzi we're as friendly as this guy. nonconfrontational, polite. Somebody should hire him ,the "celebrity-whisperer"
Imaa big boy imaa big boy 🤣🤣🤣
What a genleman this guy who made video and iner.
Everyone is parked in Red Zone... Tickets soon!
This is not a therapy session
Jackey Paulie 🤣🤣
Roiding his balls off
Just ruptured my Achilles playin ball with my kids so I’m on the road to recovery with ya Connor! You are my motivation!!!
Arnold parking in the red blocking the bus lane 🙄
He got him by calling him champ at the beginning.
This is not a therapy session.
Karma pays back to the narcissist :)
He was benching 80 pound dumbbells the other day easy. He's walking around near 180 lbs now. As he said he's actually a big boy. May be fighting at a big 170 in the future. The power difference may be very noticeable as well. We'll see!? Always exciting with McGregor.
Bet anyone connor don't win one fight at lightweight. He don't have the heart to win at that weight class to many killers at that weight. Connor never had heart we all know that . when have we seen connor fight a war in the cage. Maybe nate but nate broke him in both fights. And nate won both fights
This dude always wearing shirts with extra small sleeves
Mcnuggets is only good for.... BEING A PUNCHING BAG🤣
Conor looks good, good attitude,  energy , respectable,  class sportsman.. also good camera man and questions and not pushing for a reaction or anything . Nicely done
Wow hunge big fan conor from mizoram india 💪💪
Khabib make him humble.
He looks bigger
where did homeboy get those shorts with the slit on the sides
I love how kind the interviewer was
He’s got to be near retirement ?
Kiss the Irishman's ass why don't you!
:19 is that hassan?
Arnold "screw your freedoms" Schwarzenegger
Washed up alcoholic...
Lol it is not that this version of Conor is his “real side” or that his evil persona is his real. Just like everybody, sometimes he is in good mood and sometimes not. Here he was in excellent mood most likely because his therapy session went well, so he was happy to talk to anyone about anything.   When he is sober and in good mood he looks to be a nice dude. But who knows, maybe later he will again get drunk and start writing (and deleting) dumb tweets.
"I am a big boy"  You sure are, managing those crutches all by yourself, 👏 wow!What an egoistic dumb showman. He shows respect to the guy he defeated. But foul mouth the ones who beat the soul out of him, Khabib and Dustin. Classic sign of a true loser. McChicken. Done forever
Jake Paul? More like Snake Balls!
Idgaf what people think about Conor for real. He'll be my champ forever man. Can't take anything away from Khabib but to me he's a boring fighter.
Arnold’s car is like something out of GTA 5 lol
This interviewer/paparazzi should be sought after by every media outlet, this is how it should be done
Conor's just pissed because jake took his title of the face of boxing now 🤐
Bro how is the cast already off this shit confusing me
Nightmares: khabib 😅☝️
He's wearing the Paris Saint Germain jersey😀
God bless the Brazilians danm that was sweet 😄💙
Conor: This is a therapy session.
Losing at somthing you know your good at is very humbling after awhile.
Well Conor just helped that guy get paid!!!!
This is how all paparazzi should behave. Get your pictures and keep it respectful.
Must be nice to be rich and famous broke my ankle a year ago and I was on the couch for 8 months
he says he doesn't care until Jake comes with the 6 figure offer
Brazilian paparazzi in LA
I like this connor not the social media ass.
what conor did not realize is that peoples love him for his humor, when he verbaly attacked was very fun behind it, late years conor verbaly assaulted without any humor, that side was not fun... he need to be back old conor like he is on this video, not trying to be bad guy, but funny, confidante and ready to take over , 90% of ufc going for trash talk but only one did trash talk and make peoples piss in paints from laughting... wish him well, and hope he return with his old aproach, doesn't even matter if he wins or lose he is champion forever in our book
He is getting big
That was a nice interview McGregor was in a good mood
This is the way you should treat people. Not only for conor but also for the reported. Mutual respect.
So we can see the result Khabib made the notorious a humble guy 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Props to the interviewer.. He kept it friendly and positive instead of trying to incite and instigate
Connors actually really nice, this just shows that he just puts on a character for the UFC and he’s actually a nice fella when you treat him with respect. Shakes the paps hand and everything, nice guy. 💯
I’m a big boy 😂😂🤣
WTF did he call him wassup champ.. he’s a loser with broken bones
Did he say "Is that Arnold's car"?? Damn people living in Cali are so lucky they get to meet all the celebs!
The Notorious one is a good guy as all the guys in Ireland are cool people I’ve lived here for 20years always have good times here 🇮🇪
Polite man  be nice to people and they will happily talk to you 👍
me and my wife is muslims.. but we  "like" "support" connor more than khabib.. i mean.. khabib dont need to likes and support.. he good without that.   and connor and his talk trash.. we both dont agree about that.. still a bad thing.  but we just see connor as human.. who better than us... a human who just trying to makes money for his family as much as posible.. we like him for his hard work and how he cares about his wife(gf)/child and his mother.
Conor going up to 185 to fight bisping lol
170 conor
Everyone hates on Connor, he knows how to sell fights which is what it takes to last in this game, everytime I've seen him on off season he's humble as can be.
Good to see Connor happy man!
his right leg is so thin
Fast recovery for the big boy...!
The most over rated hyped fighter of all time.
Arnold would park in red lol
Hes the type who doesnt listen to people he just waits to talk. Literally loves to hear himself speak. Crazy how self absorbed he is.
Whats the matter ufc got you pushing too many pencils
He gains my respect everyday when he acts like himself.  This is the Conor I like 🤷🏼‍♂️💯🇮🇹. If he's like this all the time, I'll be watching him like everyone else .  Got my word
Still the champ
A lot of respect for Aldo? he was so disrespectful to him it was a joke 😂
Really simple Conor
This guy is a diamond man
Peds
He is purposely ignoring him because Jake is similar to him and he is afraid of that. Conor like to trash talk but doesn’t like getting it back especially from a real troll.
Words of encouragement for Conor... for the rest: "screw your freedom" lol
What’s up loser u should have called him like this not champion he’s lost 2 fights he is a empty vessel which makes more noise. loser chicken conor.
“ thank you sor “
McGregor will box Jake at some point. Jake v McGregor will likely do similar to Mayweather vs McGregor numbers and McGregor will likely get an even bigger chunk of the pay than he did against Floyd, I believe it would be very hard for him to turn down $150-200 million dollars...
I need those crutches. Broken ankle is not the business.
Conor is the best !❤️
thank you sir's hhaah legend
Humble mcgregor
Smooth conversion
Am a big boi…love me Connor.
I love this guy behind the camera why can’t all paparazzi be more like this guy.
Steroids and cheeseburgers.
Jaeky pauly vs conor would be fun to see
Seems humbled up after breaking his leg in the fight , I guess he felt the humiliation 🤷‍♂️ but big ups to man
Αρε ψυχή που την εχη αυτό ο τύπος σηκώθηκε πάλη κε εμησ στη Ελλάδα έχουμε έναν αναβοληκακια που έπαθε τροχεο κε έσπασε ληγο το αστράγαλο κε δεν μπορει  να σηκωθη από κρεβάτι φούσκας ειναι.αρε Κόνορ μακρεκορ τη ψυχή εχεισ είσαι λιοντάρι
PSG
Are we going to ignore the fact that he said he would love to fight Also again???
People don’t get that he acts how he acts to sell fights🤦‍♂️ That’s why he’s made the ufc over 4 billion dollars, he’s a good guy.
he dodged that Fake Brawl question...but man what a difference in character on tv vs real life
Conor in psg jersey He might be messi fan.
This is the real Conor McGregor I’ve been saying and talking about, he has ego and anger issues in his head when you’re a super hot head & in the fight game I’m the same I’m a hot head. You can easy loss control of yourself, specially in the fight game you need to chase the money.  Well done Conor ignoring that ding bat who keeps mentioning your name lol he’s your son 😂
Would it kill Connor to wear a medium sized shirt ? Somebody needs to address this.
titanium shin bone😂
Both are very kind I love it
"grin earmy trook"
Arnold is a traitor. He doesn’t care about freedoms!
Man he looks good and fit
Aye shout out to Idaho! Any fellow potatoes watching this video??
Am I the only one wondering if celebs in Hollywood are allowed to just park in the Red Zone? LOL
Could it be, Connors retirement fight, McGregor vs Aldo 2?
Jeeky Poll 🔥
In the back Dana telling everyone Conor never turns down a fight
The guy filming is like the most respectful paparazzi ever .. he litterally got Conor talking for 2 minutes... most guys get told to fook off and thats it 😂😂😂
I need people like that pumping me up
If you wondered what genuine apathy looks like about another person you came to the right video
Hope he gets better never hate on anybody better to be kind to all wish him well speedy recovery sir
He looks lost and confused poor guy did all this and now seems to be in a bad place. Hope he finds happiness and peace
I hate how ppl peg connor as an @$$hole, he is a decent dude
Looks juiced up
Conor knew everyone was gonna talk about his weight he acknowledged it before we could talk in bout he's eating well, man said "am a big boy, but am gonna cut weight" that shit was funny to me 😂😂😂
Conor is a business man... if Jake makes the right money offer.. Connor will sign on to fight.. EVERYONE HAS A PRICE... By constantly dismissing Jake, hes playing the game..
That Dismiss was classic 😂😂😂
Jake is retired. Logan will schedule another Corrupted Circus day for Christmas time. What a double of clowns they have everyone well paid and well shut all working for them. Let this unregulated Circus continue. There is no sports law in the US. TWood won yet he lost. What an amazing Circus.
This is the Connor thats been missing, maybe this busted leg humbled him a bit.
I like this version of Conor better
Can't stand the character, love the guy; can't wait to see him fight again.
Interviewer is a gent,,nice to see laid back and respectful as opposed to in ya face attention seeking.
Connor can be a Dick lol but I'm a big FAN wishing him well!!
That’s how paparazzis are supposed to act 👏🏼
Now I want to see a video of Arnold getting out of his car in advancing towards the therapy building.
doesnt give a flyin fck about fake paul
Nice to see what he had to say about Aldo. Seemed he was sad to see what happened to him.
Breaks leg and becomes nice heh
he just refresh his life, i think he will comeback with the right hand killers
Let Jake fight McGregor  in a full mma fight instead se how he dose🤣🤣
LOOKING BUFF :)
How much does Conor weigh right now he looks big
No fucks givin
I know he has to get him fight mode and his personality and psyche has to change. I like this side of him a lot better.
Dudes already walking on it? I had a tib fib break...in a cast for 6mos
Wait he supports PSG, lol
Dude he looks happy to do the interview he isn’t even annoyed to be doing it he is so nice
this is deepfaked
Jaky paul😂😂 i love brazilain
damn he looked buff i like his body like this
Jakey paul 😂😂😂
The fight queen copyright your video man 6h ago Just wanted to let you know .. 500k views if you want to report that
Is Conor high? I've never seen him like this?
Its hard to belive its the same guy who disrespected khabib...he looks so chill here...wish he would be the same in UFC...he'll be a fan favorite.
He got right he's a boy 🤣😂😅
Hes so nice he talks to every single Paparazi :))
I don’t get the public. Conner is a entertainer. That’s all I’m going to say !
what ever he talk about all of it trash ..
Somebody needs to get this guy a press badge for all future fights
Awesome interview!
he is so humble here lol
Keep getting bigger tap boy. Grow up with the big dogs a get a real ass kicking.
😂 this guy has a hold new attitude I respect it tho keep it up conor
Arnold’s car really is nice tho!
Conor is a humble person
Being so polite it is impossible to not get the best version of anybody... he even thank the bodyguards. God bless you!
How cool was that!?! Awesome video thanks bro!
You were so polite and respectful, that was one of the best paparazzi interviews I've seen. Wish everyone could be like you, well done sir
One video and everybody back on his nuts. He must have remembered to take his bipolar meds that day.
You ever notice how Conor  acts in UFC is totally different than how he acts in real life, like Colby said, it’s a show business
Wow what a nice guy
Haters think Conor is crazy all day😂
Boi conor your pants are tighter then a bih
This Conor is good to watch without talking out his arse .
What a top bloke, must get pestered all the time but really polite and respectful guy just happy to talk to fans. The people's champ
Both you and Conor were so nice to each other it was wholesome to watch, that Jake Paul question almost ruined it tho but Conor and Arnolds car saved it.
Bro no other big crazy celeb spends sm time with media mad respect
Keep off the gak....you got 1 chance left for legacy
I've always thought that Conor McGregor had a lot of Honor when it comes to people, athletes and mma. Yes he can get nasty when he's trying to sell a fight and guess what? He's beyond Rich because he's a showman. But if you watch his interviews after fights in the octagon he always gives a lot of heart and respect to his opponents. He's a damn good man in my opinion.
God will punish him more and  more and more  . Be prepare for that.
Who cares this egodude clown
Quatar Saint Germain ^^"
Conor: "Me leg is doing well. I can't wait to get back in the octagon and get me ass beat again and make  alot of money!"
Arnold "screw your freedom" Schwarzenegger.
I think I'm wrong..He's a good guy.
Sure Connor doesn't care now but give Paul a few more wins and Connor will become interested. Oh believe me he will.....
I remember khabib saying: "i wanna make him humble"
"A lot of respect for HOSE-A Aldo". So much respect that he still doesn't know how to properly pronounce his name. lol.
When you see Conor in this form he seems like such a decent polite friendly respectful person... shame he can't be a bit more like this leading up to his fights and after... I understand originally it was all about him being a trash talker and making a name for himself but he don't need to do it anymore...
God bless Corner McGregor ❤️
Arnold still has his cas from "true lies" but changed the color to white.
Who would have ever throught it would be hate from all angles of other fighters but him and Aldo on the same team with love and respect🙌
camera man was so respectful
This is how he needs to conduct himself.  Being humble is the best way…
So now it's therapy session...
Every time he talks he goes into this wired story time mode. That's brain damage right there from the Mayweather fight
If he wanted to, he could kick the shit out of jake and gain attention.
Arnold who?
Poor snake Paul is defo crying after this lmao 🤣🤣
I believe he has stopped drinking whiskey, as seen by his joyful attitude.
This is a great little interview - a lot of respect shown and didn't push some agendas. Respect to the reporter
His finished.
Little jake hope nobody dight hime again and returnes to disney.
Great papporazi.
Arnold is banging the owner of Conor's physical therapy joint.
Love Conor's new outlook on life!
Wow this is so cool,  Conor being nice to people
Is that Conor? _the titanium shinbone_?
Can't help but like the dude despite all the drunken savage tweets and fight talk.
What a lad
JAKIE PAULIE FIGHT
Whys he wearing a psg jeresy when his supposed to be a united fsn
class Conor mcgregor not even giving that clown Jake paul any attention Jake paul is not even in the same conversation as Conor mcgregor.. 👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 .. glad Conor is recovering well..
I can watch this all day Surpise suprise the king will be back soon with that fookin body
I feel like his natural accent  got stronger again...
Im a big guy......You are 5"9
That car is pretty good tho ngl
See the respect he showed for Aldo, still remembers that he wanted to give him another shot
U have to stalk someone to get this type of timing
this is not a terepy session
Did anyone else pick up that Conor likely thought about what he said about Brazil when this class act of a man mentioned that he was from Brazil? I think Conor genuinely learned something from that moment
wow I think every reporter needs to be as respectful as this fella 👏👏👏
What a cool dude.
Feels like Conor changes his personality daily lol. I want to belive that all his trash talk is just for attention grabbing.
Masterpiece interview...
Respect to the guy recording, so humble. Cheers. Not like those Hollywood reporters....
Actually this is the first video or fottage were Connor is able to make him dont hate his guts and childish games .. respect for that Irish pub
Connor McChubbers
how can anyone hate this bloke....hes a fookin champion!
Conor is neglecting his son, Jake.
Wish my man would just be like this all the time, he doesn't need to be an asshole for us to like him, hope he realises that
This has to be the most polite interview we've ever witnessed  between conor mcgregor and a reporter lol 😂
He looks chubbier than Khabib.
Interviewer is way better than other interviewer...He is Brazilian he is not english but he have some class...poirior don't have that's the difference
He's bipolar
Champ 👏
Big boy who gets tierd in a round 🤣
real mcgregors a good person and we love how humble he is, the fans understand he has to play the villain to sell fights because noone else will
🚲🚳🚲🚳🚲🚳🚲🚳🚲🚳
He’s looking about 185 lbs? Too high?
"This is not a therapy session"
hope he gets well soon
This was so nice ... I liked this interview
Humbled Conor
I am 5000% sure that McGregor will fight Jake Paul next. He can't beat anyone in MMA and he loves high paying, low risk/high reward fights.
His left leg looks FOOKIN tiny. The Atrophy shit sucks, fooked me ac joint in me shoulder and took all the muscle away. Dustin's woife still slidin into dem dm's as we speak
Starting to look like a boss now lol
1:34 Father asks for my math marks
Champ  Macroger
I'll always cheer and root for McGregor always
Dudes healing up pretty fast I'm glad for him....hope he makes a big comeback and starts whooping ass in that octagon once again
No ones talking about his shirt?
Conor was the only one who made me love MMA, Khabib took it too series and ruined it for all then he quit
Connor finally sounds humbled
😭😭 Please Conor, don't get knocked out again! 😭😭
Hey Magregor, do you want to have a taste of the "Lion of Judah"? Get well soon and we'll see;)
The weight looks so good on him!
He will never be the same after this injury.
Psg babahh
Those pain pills had him chatty
Conor VS Paul
Conor McLegger
This is not a terapy session.
Wow 7 months later..  Stay healthy Connor
when arnolds car is more important than jake paul lol
While Khabitch is getting fat and critizise everyone as a retiring coward he is
This dudes still walking a crunches... awesome. I've got my dose of serotonin for the day
Conor was super friendly, feels like him and the interview are best friends😂
Connor better humble up or get mauled again
... what a nice interaction between a celebrity and a Paparazzi for a change, refreshing.
“Arnold” 😂
"This is not a therapy session"
This guys treats his fan rights
Holy shit, that's sick car!
Love or hate the guy, UFC is popular because of characters like him.
He's finished
Conor loves those tight ass shirts huh
Good to see you Connor, looking good!
Maquina total
God bless the brasilians 😂 I love this side of Conor honestly
Arnold “fk your freedoms” Swartzanegger
That’s the Conor I remember 👍 all the best
That Joke Paul switch from Conor was smooth lmao he doesn't care about the kid
Didn't even know that Conor got his cast off, that's great news - damn he looks about a month away (from the Trilogy Fight w/Nate).
holy shit conor is looking full, i think he gonna comeback in welterweight
Incredible
Arnold’s car? Parked in Red! Ha!
Is he humble now?
Love this interviewer, very respectful, enjoyed watching your interview my man. You got him to drop his guard and brought his good side out. Your a pro brother, God bless you. ✌🏼
Nice CAR! Great to see Conor up and about too. Its kind of shit without him.
Conor is a beast!!!
Even the orange and white sign behind Conor is copying him
Paps are the lowest. Shit up their noses!
Arnolds climate car. Screw your Freedom car.
He done it!!!!!!!! Money money 💰 money
Good interview
This is the real Conor mcgregor, everybody think he is a asshole but no he is just a businessman who dont give à fook about what People thinck of him, when he is in a normal day he just a cool guy.
break the other leg 🤪
He’s not a bad person as people claim man it’s almost impossible to imagine his life and the amount of people that really want him to fail.
This guy is the real deal. Sales fights..but is realistically down to earth and cares for others.
From punching old men to walking like old men.
Mcnugget only praises the guys he beat, cus he a sore loser
Connors the type of guy u see on the street and just has a chat with u
Love that Conor
I was waiting him to say " Shut the foooking u" 🤣
Imagine being connors son in Liverpool knowing your dad paid your mum to lie about dna results just to save his marriage. Connor is a scumbag.
The way he dismissed jake 😂
Plz don’t fight Aldo we don’t want another Dustin situation 😂
Conor said himself he wants to move up and fight Stylebender.  Call me crazy but I think Conor knocks him out inside of 1 round.  Conor has put in the work to be great and has taken the big risks.  He deserves this opportunity and you have to admire his sheer audacity.  Sure, he has been blessed with .01% athletic gifts such as insane speed and lethal Deontay level punching power, these are innate qualities.  But what impresses me the most is his determination, heart, and mind for the craft.   This is a man that will not quit under any circumstances and has dedicated his life to studying the craft in pursuit of excellence.  We should all be commending him for that but instead all I see is hate being thrown from timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.
communist arnold " f your freedoms"
Super cool...he is privat such a nice guy....i'm glad to see him getting better and better...thx for the video bro.....👍👍from 🇦🇹
Brilliant interview mate👍🏽 Conor forever n beyond 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Who do you have in the jake paul fight?  - i don't really care,  IS THAT ARNOLD CAR?   Lol dude really doesn't care at all
Jake Paul has won more matches in 18 months than Conor in his entire stint as an LHW.
He support PSG
I didn't know paulo costa changed his carrier
looks like a chubby grandpa now
You know his leg is gonna be 5x stronger
Da hora irmão salve do Brazil
Jesus mans shredded
I like this Conor
He’s so nice lol I loved how he didn’t care at all about Jake :D
He's bulking up
He’s looking jakceeed!!!
Conor puts on so many faces, one moment he’s a complete douche and then the next he seems like a down to earth guy. Hard to tell who tf the real Conor is 😂
Conor has such a vibrant personality!
Kept it light & let him do the talking, good interviewer
Cut weight or you'll get kill at 185
He's white fans keep him relevant. This guy lost so many times. Super trash.
I see you conner rocking that PSG soccer shirt yeeeeesssir💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽🇫🇷🗼
Next psg transfer to replace mbappe is conor mcgregor
🇧🇷💓
Did he have to cut Weight ?
he looks hugee
Connor gained a lot of weight.. You can see by his face... 😁
Great interviewer.
Everyone’s hating on Conor but they forget they probably got into ufc because of him
He looks bigger than 170
Jake Paul must be hurt inside that his father doesn't care about him.
I don't how you do it time after time but I love it
it's videos like this that make me want to believe mcgregor isn't a total narcassist and asshole.
Conor's actually a nice guy but he turns into a complete asshole in the fight buildups
👑🇮🇪
Conor king 👑❤️❤️
Class interviewer!
The man
Conor had to ask where's that guy from😂😂. Come on man
Less go double champ.
Good men respect conor🤗🤗🤗😍
